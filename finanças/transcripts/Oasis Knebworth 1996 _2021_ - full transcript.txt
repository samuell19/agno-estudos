[CROWD CHEERING] Hello. Hello! Hello-ah! Aloha! I can do that all night. Hello! CROWD: Hello! [WHISTLING AND CHEERING] [CROWD CHANTING] Oasis! Oasis! [CROWD CONTINUES CHANTING] And finally, it's been called the rock concert of the decade. Quarter of a million rock fans at Knebworth in Hertfordshire for one of the biggest ever open air concerts in Britain. '96 was just the best year. We had just the most amazing summer. It was cool Britannia. Had films like Trainspotting. Some fantastic music out there. Britpop and the Blur vs. Oasis Battle. With all that garbage going on... Euro '96. [CROWD CHEERING] New Labour was just about to come in. It was a good feeling throughout the whole country. [CROWD CHEERING] And Oasis were there in the middle of it. ♪ Tonight I'm a rock 'n' roll star ♪ Power to the people! [CROWD CHEERING] I remember Noel being on theBreakfast show in May, and he announced this massive gig. "One night at Knebworth, "tickets go on sale this Saturday." It was a pre Twitter, pre Facebook age and pre mobile phone age. I think I saw it maybe in the newspaper or music magazine. I saw it on Ceefax. Instead of having the Internet, you have this crappy teletext. Getting the tickets was quite a strange one because it was back in the days when you're in a queue in a venue or calling in. [MUSIC PLAYING] Everybody knew there was this one moment to get these tickets. We arranged to get up at 3:00. We all coordinated, how we're going to do it, different houses, different phone lines. We get to Way Ahead Records in Nottingham. Saturday morning... Up crack of dawn. Secretly went to my Gran's house. I remember the queue going up the side of the street. Tickets went on sale 9:00 a.m. You're there ready. I used my old man's credit card. It was a landline phone attached to the wall. Sat on the bottom stair. On the side of the arm chair. With an old beige BT phone on my lap. Dialing up the same number. The ticket hotline. Eep, eep, eep. Engaged constantly. Calling and calling. I made the mistake of going out the night before. It was painful. Redial, redial. Constantly hitting the orange redial button. Eep, eep, eep, eep. Must've pressed it a thousand times. It was so frustrating. Would've been so easy just to give up. One of my friends had this genius idea of calling the operator and saying he was struggling to get through to a certain number, gave him the ticket line. OPERATOR: Hold the line. Amazingly, they put him straight through.[CHUCKLES] I think by half past 10:00, it was pretty clear that we're having a landsliding result. It was just blowing every box office record out of the water. Two million people tried to get the tickets to see the band of the moment, Oasis, at Knebworth in Hertfordshire. You pay the guy 22.50, probably 50 pence booking fee. Every single ticket we sold over that weekend was either sold in person or sold over the phones. I think we bought a couple of tickets each and that was it. Job done. Mission accomplished. [PHONE RINGING] Five hours later... I hear the ring. OPERATOR: Oasis hotline. I was shaking. I remember the moment so clearly. Got through, asked for two tickets. But they were like, "No, there's none left." But she says, "We do have tickets to Knebworth." And I just automatically said, "Yeah, that's fine. I'll take them." I run downstairs to my dad, "Where's Knebworth." I was running up and down the hallway going, "Yes, I've got tickets. I've got tickets." I was only 14. Then my parents, they were like, "You're not going to Knebworth. "Absolutely not." Um, and I think my brother realized this as well and he phoned to say, "I'll take you." Like, sure, he wasn't even an Oasis fan. Finally got through. The guy on the other end of the phone was kind enough to then give me tickets for both nights. The first show that I booked for Oasis was a room above a pub, holds 120 people or something. That was between March and May 1994. By August '96, they were playing to a quarter of a million people. Nobody thought that one day we'd have sold ten million albums and we would be playing to 250,000 people over two days. Anyone that said that they did believe that is a liar. I had a reasonable degree of confidence that we'd get to two nights, but I don't think anybody thought we'd sell both of them out on the day. Oasis could have sold six nights, eight nights. Who knows? The best thing that they did is they only did two nights, which makes those shows even more magical. [MUSIC PLAYING] We did go and look at various places with the band and their people, but we went to Knebworth last. I remember Noel bubbling up in his vintage chocolate brown roller. You could tell from the moment he arrived, he just went, "Yep." He liked the whole vibe of it, just the sense of scale, it dripped with history. And, you know, he was hanging out with the Aristos. INTERVIEWER: Are you an Oasis fan? I... I think I might be by the end of the weekend, but I don't know their music very well at the moment. - So you've not got an... - I... I understand that they are extremely... What I've heard of them is it sounds just right for this sort of big event. They are very good on stage. So I'm sure it will be a terrific success. And when you hear the stats afterwards, it's about 2.7% of the population that applied for tickets and didn't get them. Then you realize how lucky you actually were. They had a brilliant photo on them. They were part of the gig, they were part of that experience. It's literally Willy Wonka and the Golden Ticket. REPORTER: Hertfordshire police have orchestrated a massive operation codenamed Operation Gold, to deal with a massive influx of fans. [HELICOPTER WHIRRING] They were showing that you didn't have to be this kind of big, bloated, enormodome stadium bands. [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] You could be an exciting rock and roll band and still play at Knebworth, where Zeppelin had played, where the Stones had played. The people who played Knebworth, when you look at them, they tend to fall into the legends category. Just take pictures, don't ask questions, cheeky bastard. And for a band like Oasis to, at that stage of their career, have the confidence and the swagger to put themselves in the same bracket as the Pink Floyds' and Led Zeppelins' of this world, history will remember it fondly. [ELECTRONIC GUITAR PLAYING] It was like a calling to those Oasis fans. This kind of special moment where these working class lads were gonna go and do the biggest gig that's ever been seen in the UK. [STRUMMING GUITAR] It was that moment in history where you had to be there, you could taste it. NOEL: My whole thing with that group was rehearsing, rehearsing, rehearsing, rehearsing. I want it to be second nature. I want to do it without thinking about it. So I could fucking do it standing on my head. And then we could all enjoy the gig. I could be... I could be like a fan. [ELECTRIC GUITAR PLAYING] Yeah, we were tight as fuck. We were a really, really fucking tight band. We never did shit gigs. It's Getting Better, Man!

[MUSIC STOPS] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] From the start up to Knebworth the speed it happened and the scale it got to, it probably took me five years before it actually sunk in, you know? And I knew Zeppelin had played it, you know, and I knew it was a massive thing to be doing. [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] But my initial thoughts on it when I saw it as an empty field is like, "Yeah, it's just a field." you know, "It's not that big." REPORTER: Quarter of a million rock fans are counting the hours to Gallagher brothers take the stage. Yes, Oasis are playing Knebworth tomorrow in what's being called "the gig of the decade." I come from Carmathen, a small town in South Wales. [CHUCKLES] So it was four of us in this small little white Mini Metro. It was on its last legs. Probably about 20 miles in, I think, the engine started steaming. I was like, "Oh, fuckin' hell." I think the four-hour journey took us about seven or eight hours. ♪ I'm free to be whatever I ♪ Whatever I choose ♪ And I'll sing the blues If I want ♪ MAN: Yeah, take a look.

We managed to stay dry and people were coming up, "I'll give you £5 for a bin bag." We're like, "No, it's okay. You can have it." Or, "here's a beer instead." Yeah, it was a great atmosphere. ♪ You only see what people Want you to see ♪ MAN: Radio 1. Hi, this is Jo Whiley welcoming you to a rather special event on Radio 1, the live gig of the year, if not the decade. Between now and 10:30, we'll bring you Oasis in all their evening glory from Knebworth Park, live and exclusive on Radio One. ♪ Here in my mind... ♪ JO: We had to be up at stupid o'clock in the morning to get on the bus to come in to Birmingham and get on the train to Knebworth. MATT: We're on this old rust bucket of a coach that must have only had three gears... No toilet, no telly. We're all drinking, we're singing away. It was just a party atmosphere, the whole way down. All singing Oasis songs, all wearing the bucket hats, and these were the days where you can really smoke in buses. MARTIN: We decided that we'd drive as close as we could, parked in a little lay-by, and then, basically, walked across the fields. [MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING] IAN: On the morning of the gig, I found out my girlfriend of only eight months at the time was pregnant. A bit of a shock, but yes, spent that full day coming to terms with the fact I was going to be a dad, quickly realized as well it wasn't going to be as lively as I thought it was going to be 'cause I had a pregnant girlfriend to look after. ♪ Whatever I choose ♪ And I'll sing the blues If I want ♪ - Where have you travelled from? - Buckingham. Northamptonshire. Chesterfield. Has anybody told you you look like Liam? A few times, yeah. [ALL CHEERING] Where are you from? [SPEAKING SIMULTANEOUSLY] Manchester. [SPEAKING SIMULTANEOUSLY] We're fucking cockneys, we are. We're cockneys, we are. Soft cockneys. INTERVIEWER: Where are you from? Birmingham. Doncaster. Where are you from, Jim? Well, Africa originally, but now North Yorkshire. Manchester. Manchester! Where's the toilets? We need a toilet. ♪ Everybody knows ♪ But now I say nothing... [CONTINUE SINGING] We've doing two concerts, two nights running. And we've never done 125,000 in, 125,000 out, in, out... So, a quarter of a million people over the weekend. Knebworth itself is not the easiest of venues to operate. It's served by a relatively small small station and the roads are tiny. MAN: 40,000 people had to come by coach. So all the coaches, when they came off the main road, had to go down these tiny, little winding back roads that were only enough width to get one coach through. [MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING] Then you go closer, and you see that sign to Radio Supernova, they had there own radio channel, and you're like... This is something different from going to normal gigs. It was a mass coming together. EMMA: And of course, when you arrived, being blown away by the size and scale of it. MAN: It's like, wow, this is massive. I think I was just happy to be there. I've got a ticket, I'm here. Brilliant. You could feel a vibe about the place. Getting closer and closer, and the buzz was getting bigger and bigger. It was a lovely, sunny day. People singing Oasis songs... Everyone was on such a high, and not from the drugs we were on at the time... ...but just a natural high and the excitement! [OASIS SONG PLAYING] I want to get backstage. JODIE: The gates opened, everyone's putting their tickets through, they're just ripping them and giving you the ticket back. You almost didn't want to hand it over when you got to Knebworth, because they were gonna tear a bit off it. Like, don't tear that off. That's my ticket. MAN: Everyone just started running. And of course, you just join in, hundreds of us. The gates open, and it's like running down as fast as you can to the front pen. WOMAN: That was your mission. That's the main reason for queueing up for hours and hours. One of my mates went flying on the way. Excuse me, out the way, coming through. Mind your backs. Like a pair of paramedics. WOMAN: We just grabbed each other's hands and we just legged it so fast down to that stage. There's all these security guards in their high-vis everywhere going, "Stop running!" [OASIS SONG PLAYING] We were just going for it. And we just got down to pit one. We got our wristbands and we ended up in the barrier. MAN: You know when you've got that band on, that's like the Holy Grail. WOMAN: We were just ambling, like, mouths gaping. And then all of a sudden, the security guard came up to us. She had blonde hair. She went, "You two, come with me now." [OASIS SONG PLAYING] And she guided us around the crowd, put wristbands on us and took us right into the mosh pit. [SONG CONTINUES PLAYING] And we were on the front ofThe Independent newspaper. So we were there on the barrier, we're at the front. We can't leave our spot to go and get food or go to the toilet. So we just had to hold on to our bladders the whole day. [INAUDIBLE] The amount of people just walking around looking like Liam was amazing. It was the greatest gathering of Liam haircuts in the world. WOMAN: Did you go to bed early in preparation for this weekend? MAN: Yeah, well... So what we done was, I've got my mates staying with us from Manchester. On Thursday night, we stayed up all night and had a bit of a pint because it was the last one we were gonna have for the weekend. But if we hadn't stayed up all night till about 7:00 a.m. we wouldn't have been able to sleep Friday night, 'cause we'd be like, too nervous. [ROUND ARE WAY PLAYING] ♪ Round are way The birds are singing ♪ Round are way The sun shines bright ♪ Round are way The birds are minging ♪ Round are way It's all right ♪ Round are way The birds sing for you ♪ 'Cause they Already know you ♪ Yeah, they already know you [MUSIC FADES] [UP IN THE SKY PLAYING] ♪ Hey you! Up in the sky ♪ Learning to fly Tell me how high...♪ MAN: I knew the minute Noel stepped in with this list of songs that he'd already written, once we'd got together, as a band and sort of, figured out these songs and rehearsed them, there was no doubt, I don't think, in any of our minds that it was going to go somewhere. [CROWD CHEERING] NOEL: If somebody would have said, in a couple of years' time, you're going to be playing to a quarter of a million people over two nights, at Knebworth where Led Zeppelin and Queen had played, you were going to fly in by helicopter, and all these bands are gonna be supporting you, I'd have been, like, come on, really? [HELICOPTER WHIRRING] There's seven of us on that flight. And the reason there's seven of us is Mark Coyle is on it, and Phil Smith. Outside of the band, they were the two people who were there at the very, very, very, very beginning. Mark Coyle was our soundman in the boardwalk and Phil was one of our roadies. WOMAN: Who's your favorite member of the band? Liam! [GIGGLING] Bedroom eyes. Noel. Liam I suppose. Liam. WOMAN: Why? Don't know. Just his attitude. Liam. Noel. It's gotta be Noel. Noel. Liam. Shit, he's so horny. Liam is the best. ALL: Liam. [SPEAKING SIMULTANEOUSLY] Liam's an utter bastard. Got to be Guigsy, playing top string on the bass. MAN: Well, I suppose Noel. Noel Gallagher. It's got to be Noel. Liam. Liam! He's lovely! He's gorgeous. The biggest blue eyes you've ever seen. I love him. I love him! Noel. 'Cause he's sexy. WOMAN: Why? And he's talented and he's gorgeous and I want to marry him. [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Loads! [ALL LAUGHING] [CROWD CHANTING] Oasis! Oasis! Oasis! MAN: The Bootleg Beatles came on. WOMAN: Ocean Color Scene. Cast, Manic Street Preachers. MAN: The Chemical Brothers were on pretty early. WOMAN: And the Charlatans. MAN: Their keyboardist Rob Collins had died two or three weeks beforehand. Obviously, an immortal performance. But you could feel it, like it was pretty, pretty raw. They were big groups in themselves. They might not sell out Knebworth, but they were huge in their own right. It was pretty special, actually. These tickets for £22.50, you know, to see Oasis for £22.50 is a bargain. To get another five or six bands every day, I think it was pretty phenomenal. With every band that came on, you could feel the energy building. WOMAN: And then, The Prodigy came on. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] MAN: I wasn't sure what to expect going in. The Prodigy, it's drum and bass, whatever. You know, boom, boom, boom. And then it's like, fucking hell. WOMAN: It was like nothing you've ever seen. MAN: They nearly stole the show from Oasis. They came on and they absolutely owned it. You could feel the bass pumping through you. They were full force, it was like volume 11. I was scared.[LAUGHS] You know what I mean? It was like who the fuck are these people? They jumped in the crowd and everything. It's like, don't come near me, like. You're going to fucking eat me. The crowd went absolutely wild for them. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] We were right at the front, and Keith jumped into the crowd and literally landed on me and I was like, who's this man? Max has got this massive glove on, it's all steel. He's got these crazy contact lenses in. I'd never seen anything like it. The stage was like 20 feet away from my Winnebago. I tried... I tried to sleep through The Prodigy. Can you believe that? WOMAN: I just remember it going into a bit of a lull, and then you sort of became aware that people were starting to slowly edge forward. MAN: The energy pulsating through the crowd was unbelievable. Everyone was so excited. You see the Marshall speakers come onto the stage. You see the drum kit come onto the stage and you're screaming with excitement. Just because you've seen that. The darkness was coming in. And just the anticipation you felt it building, and building, and building. WOMAN: It was just electric. [CROWD SCREAMING] NOEL: I don't remember being in the fucking slightest bit nervous. It was just kind of... go on stage, and you know, each step of the band, each six months, got bigger and bigger. We'd already done arenas. We'd already done a couple of stadiums, like Maine Road, and that was just the next step. [CROWD CHEERING] The build up to it was just immense. I still hear that ringing "Oasis, Oasis!" [CROWD CHANTING] Oasis! Oasis! Oasis! [CLAPPING RHYTHMICALLY] Oasis! Oasis! Oasis! [CHEERING CONTINUES] Oasis! Oasis! Oasis! [AUDIENCE SCREAMING] But everyone's getting really pumped up, ready for Oasis, ready for Noel, ready for Liam, Bonehead, Guigs, Whitey. WOMAN: I thought I was going to explode with excitement. [CROWD CHEERING] [HELICOPTER WHIRRING] WOMAN: The crowd just surged forward, and we were crushed into the barrier. You could hardly breathe. And you didn't really care. We were at the front of Oasis playing at Knebworth. [CROWD CHEERING] And then this countdown starts happening. Ten, nine. AUDIENCE: Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two... Tom-tom kicks in. [MIMICKING HARMONICA SOUND] MARTIN: That sound just kind of hit you. [CROWD SCREAMING] DANIEL: As soon as you heard that, then you felt a wave of anything just come from the crowd. [CROWD SCREAMING] [CROWD CHEERING] [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] The crowd would just go nuts. WOMAN: Your heart's beating. Any minute now. MAN 1: This is what it was for. That's what you've made the effort for. MAN 2: It's this build up. And you kind of love it, but you also want it to finish because you want them to come on stage as soon as possible. [GUITAR MUSIC PLAYING] Oasis! Come on! [CROWD CHANTING] All right! All right! MAN: Then Liam walks out, and he's got his white jacket on, and you're like, "Fucking hell. Let's rock and roll, eh?" WOMAN: I was in awe. I was absolute awestruck by it. I couldn't believe my luck. MAN: He just kind of raised his arms. It felt like God's calling out to his disciples. Here's our rock god. "Yeah, I'm here. "I'm gonna entertain you. "I'm gonna kick the fuck out of Knebworth for the next two hours." Columbia comes on, which is my favorite song, anyway. It's like, now we're having it. Hair starts coming up on the back of my neck. I can smell the hot dogs, taste the beer... Shivers. Oh, just... man!

You know, it was quite incredible in that timeframe. WOMAN: My favorite song ever Acquiesce was Number two. When it came on, I just remember thinking, "Oh!"

We were the guys listening to it. You could think they were into the same things I'm into. I'm into the same things that they're into. They're guys from a council estate. That's how they make their money. That's their job. They don't think they're lucky. They just know that they're good at their job.

MAN 1: Whoever you spoke to, wherever they came from they would have similar stories about trying to get tickets, similar stories about how they got there.

WOMAN: It was a collection of people that were there with a shared love of this great northern band. [CROWD CHEERING] What is it like riding away, out there about 50 miles away? Is it any good?

MAN: Just walking around the site, it was incredible that people were enjoying the show quarter of a mile from the stage. LIAM: It goes on forever and ever out there, man. MAN: And to an extent part of that was the knowledge that a lot of thinking had gone in to try and make sure that people in the back got a show. You want them to be going home thinking you had the best time ever and I think the vast majority of people did. The screens were at the time absolute cutting edge and huge. There are challenges of having a field that big, you know, time delay being one of them. They had a screen on stage and they dubbed it theWonderwall. And looking back now it's rubbish, but at the time, it was amazing. ♪ You only see what People want you to see ♪ INTERVIEWER: If you could give something to the band, what would it be?

[CROWD CHEERING] MADDY: And then they started to play Masterplan. This one's called The Masterplan. It's about being young. And you're all young, you're all making history today. Never forget that.

MAN: It beggars belief, that song was a good song. It's insane. Is anyone coming tomorrow? CROWD: Yes! Probably a few of you, I know. MAN: If you could give something to the band, what would it be? [LAUGHS] - WOMAN: Go on, Jane. - It's far too X-rated. The pleasure that they give to us. Yeah, they give us so much pleasure for being here. It's...[LAUGHS] [LAUGHTER] WOMAN: At least it's just on the spot. It's not funny. You're a few pints too late, I'm afraid. MAN: If you could give something to the band, what would it be? A night out with us. I'd like to shag Patsy. I'm sorry, what was that? What would you like to give back to the band? A lot of love. [LAUGHTER] It is about time something good came out of Britain. I mean, it's been going downhill for the last 20 years or so. Oasis came out, and they bring out proper music again. MAN: What would you give them? I'd give them me, you know, then I could just be with them all the time. NOEL: I don't have huge rock star ambitions that would come after writingLive Forever. Then a fuckin' bomb went off, and that was it. ♪ Maybe... We were a pretty decent band the night before I wroteLive Forever, but it was Indie music. The day after I wrote Live Forever, we were going to be the biggest band in the world. I knew it. I knew enough about music and enough about songs to know that that wasn't Indie music.

Oasis was us, you know. In a sense, it belonged to the people. In a bigger sense, in a more important sense, it belongs to us, and... they were there to see us. We weren't there to look at them and that's what separated us from most bands. We flip that, "we are not worthy" on its head, but we are worthy. Enjoy it. [CROWD CHEERING] LIAM: Good night, thank you very much. GARETH: They were at the height of their powers. There'd been this journey that you felt you'd been on with them. You know, they've gone from being a relatively small band, and then this meteoric rise over the space of two years. They always made you feel like you're part of it. And it's a bit us and them. You're with us. You're with the band and don't worry about the rest of the people out there. So you really did feel, you know, you're on that journey with them. WOMAN: I remember, taking stock of that moment and turning back and going, "Yes, this was awesome!" MAN: For us, we got the two tickets, so we're going, "I'm fucking seeing that again tomorrow." [LAUGHING] That's what we were thinking. As we were all going over the empty pint glasses and the crackling of plastic, there's this guy, sat in a tree and he'd obviously been perched in his own VIP spot to watch the gig and we all started chanting, "Hey, you, up in a tree, you wanna be me?" [SHOUTING] Manchester! Yay! Fuck, you're brilliant! If you'd been at gig all day and you know, essentially it's in a field with a fence around it, and so you've gotta find your way back to the station or your coach, that's a mile away and obviously it was dark. It's not the easiest way to find your way home, is it, especially after a few drinks? On the first night, the police showed me the surveillance picture of all of these Oasis fans decided to walk back to Stevenage station, which wasn't a long walk, but it's a much shorter walk when you cut across the high speed mainline out of King's Cross. There were a lots of stories of people peeing in people's gardens and falling in ditches and wherever else. Uh, we had very few casualties, considering the levels of inebriation. At that point, I could not wait to get on the coach, I was exhausted. I got on the coach, I fell asleep. I was asleep, for about two hours, and we were still In the car park. When I woke up, I thought, we'd be half way home. I couldn't believe it. I was one of the last people to leave the site and, and this limo pulled up and the guy wound the window down and he said, "Hey, mate! Do you know how we get out? Been driving around for hours. "I can't leave the site." I said, "Well, I'm going the way you need to go. "Can I have a lift? You know, I'll show you." And he sort of looked over his shoulder and he was clearly asking someone in the back and he says, "Yeah, just hop in the back." And I jumped in the back and it was Kate Moss and Anna Friel. So, uh, that was a nice way to a round off my evening. I went to the Sunday gig. I'm thinking, right, I'm gonna go in a day before, you know, thinking, who's gonna queue longer than that. All I had was what I was wearing and my ticket, my wallet and a packet of Shiraz. It rained and it was cold and I didn't take no drink or food or anything with me. I think it got to about 6:30 in the morning when the, you know, the lesser bands started turning up. It was daylight the next day when we got home, like sort of, half past six in the morning and every else had gone. So it was just me in this deserted town center with the Sunday morning sunshine and yeah, you sort of reflect on what you've just done. I had attended the gig of my lifetime, probably. And you sort of sat there, thinking, "Where do you go from here? How do you top that? "How am I ever gonna recapture that feeling?" WOMAN: I remember going home, but feeling very smug. Sort of flicking my hair, nonchalantly, behind me, as I went into sixth form, going, "Yeah, yeah, I went to Knebworth this weekend, yeah. "What did you do?" JO: It's Radio 1 live from Knebworth and with one of the stars of the show... MAN: What do you mean "one of the stars"? JO: The star of the show joins me now. Just 'cause Liam's not here, you're allowed to say that, Noel Gallagher. MAN: Uh, hello! How are you? Uh uh, a bit hung over after last night, but... JO: What was it like last night for you? MAN: Yeah, it was, it was, uh it's hard, it's hard to put into words, really. 'Cause, I mean, it's the biggest gig we've... It's the biggest gig anyone's ever played at, anywhere, in England. JO: This gig that you're doing tonight, is gonna be going out to, was it 40 countries around the world and 500 radio stations? Will that be going through your head when you're playing? MAN: Well, it will now you've just mentioned it, yeah. [LAUGHING] It is mind boggling. And it's all about us. We arrived in London, early afternoon. It was meant to be like a day trip. And there was this little shop, that had a sign on the window. They had one ticket left. And the guy in this shop, told us, "Okay, there's a friend of mine that might have another ticket, not far from here, so go there. So, we ran to the other shop and we went there and we took the second ticket. The guy there was, "Okay, now you have to go to Knebworth." Of course, we didn't have any mobile. He told us, "Okay, you have to go to King's Cross, then take the train to Stevenage. You can do it, you can do it, but, run, run." In ten minutes, we found two tickets. I mean, it was impossible. JO: And at the gig tonight, are there any surprises, anything for people to look forward to, that they're gonna hear? MAN: We had a mate of ours, playing with us last night, during Champagne Supernova. Um... WOMAN: Any chance that might happen again? MAN: Oh, yes, he's playing tonight. MAN: I can't, I can't... JO: Oh? Say no more! Look, I can't tell you who it is though, because... I'll give you a clue though, he's on the dole at the moment. So he's there, but he's gotta go and sign on tomorrow, so he might have to scarper quick after the gig. Me and my brother, we had Radio 1 on, listening to the buildup, and Jo Whiley was on, waiting. Aerial sellotaped to the wall for best possible reception. Blank tapes, brand new, out of the cellophane. Brother snuck me a couple of cans of Stones Bitter. I was only 15, my Mom and Dad knew not to bother me, when that concert would come on. JO: And how are the rest of the band at the moment? MAN: Uh, Liam's still in bed. JO: Is he? MAN: Well, he was last seen, well, the last I... JO: I hope he gets up soon. MAN: He was driving around the site at about nine o'clock this morning off his head with his, with his, uh, with his fiance. JO: Oh, yeah? In a golf buggy, champing, uh champing some, I don't know... It was several people's jobs just to run the VIP Village, which was a series of huge, sort of marquee tents. Well, it was 7,000 on the guest list, Jesus Christ! That's bigger than a lot of venues, bigger than Brixton Academy. Ginormous! I think you could safely say. Well, I don't think he went backstage. Being so close to London, it was like the scene on tour. You know, just decamped from central London for a day and into a park in Hertfordshire. This was a lively time in British society, you know. A lot of, there's a lot of drug taking. There's a lot of heavy drinking. But it was the biggest gig that ever happened in the UK. There was a lot of stars there, but I didn't experience any undue diva attitude. [CROWD CHEERING] There was so much energy in that field, all of a sudden, it was just like, boom! You see a shoe go up in the air and you think, fucking hell, whose shoe is that? Somebody started a food, rubbish fight. It just erupted. Everybody's six, seven hours of food, cans just got catapulted in the air. Shoes, bags, sandwiches, MAN: Black bags. WOMAN: Plastic cups. MAN 1: Trousers. MAN 2: Bottles. Toilet paper rolling in the air. If it could be picked up, it was thrown. A tsunami of litter flying through the air. A hundred thousand people throwing shit around. And it mustn't have been fun for the people that went underneath it. A guy next to us got smashed in the face by an orange. MAN 1: I thought was beautiful. MAN 2: It was amazing. Whoever started that, please, be very proud of yourself. The clouds went grey, got like a moody feeling in the air, once you hear The Swamp Song tape in the deck ready to record and play. JO: What's the last thing you do before you go on stage? Do you have any kind of weird ritual, Noel? NOEL: Usually get, well... I usually drink a cup of black coffee, 'cause it opens up the muscles in the throat, allegedly, and just pace up and down a lot and just shout at people to hurry up. Liam could be quite entertaining tonight. JO: You think so? NOEL: I think, yeah, I think... JO: He was quite low key last night. NOEL: Yeah, he was sober last night. so he could actually surpass himself on the, on the nob-ometer tonight. The noise was incredible, they'd not even picked up a guitar yet. [CROWD CHEERING] And then Noel walks out and he says, this is history, right here right now. This is history. This is history, right here right now. This is history. I thought it was Knebworth, what are you on about? Are we all going for history for the weekend, to watch Oasis? This is history, we are part of his huge, huge thing. I think that's the first time I knew this was something different. It wasn't just a normal gig. That's what it's all about, innit? That's why you follow a band, for them moments.

MATT: Seeing Noel and Liam on stage. And they're giving it all the really big bollocks and you see this stuff in the newspapers and everything else. But at the end of the day, they're just two brothers, mucking about, and I stood there in the crowd, with my brother, mucking about.

I remember him walking down off the stage, and walking in front of the crowd, and I grabbed his wrist... And I'm like, "I'm not letting go for dear life." I'm not-- I'm not doing it. I thought I was in love with Liam Gallagher when I was 20. And probably was, to be fair. I had a life size cardboard cut out of Liam Gallagher at the top of my stairs. [INAUDIBLE] I loved it. I was proud of being a Liam head. [MUSIC CONTINUES] MAN: I've got the opening lyrics to Champagne Supernova tattooed on my arms. How many special people change? How many lives are living strange? It's like a religion to me. Something about that band and that group of people. Together on the stage, making that music that Noel had written, that was untouchable. Nice one, nice one. Come in, take easy. Have a good night. Fucking live forever every bloody damn one of ya. Nice one for the support bands and all that. Rocky, John Squire, Oasis and yeah... Also to the Charlatans, the Cast and everyone else who's played with us. You all know about that. Let's do it again sometime, yeah? CROWD: Yeah! LIAM: I am the Walrus.

Picks up the tambourine, walks the front of the stage. It's like he's looking for me. He's fucking looking for me. Points to me and it's like, "This is definitely happening now." I don't know how the fuck he remembered who I was. And then, yeah, jumps down. Security everywhere. It's like fucking Liam Gallagher is there. This is actually happening now. This is gonna happen. Then he just walks up and hands me his tambourine. I was like, "Fuck."[LAUGHS] And, like, everyone behind was going, "Let me have it." And I was like, "No one else is touching it." During I am the Walrus, it was absolutely bottling down. I didn't know it at the time, but it felt sort of like the end of my youth. The rain was coming to wash that away, so it'd give me a clean start. Four weeks later, after being on the dole for three years, I had a job, a baby on the way. So it really was a changing point in my life. ROMINA: We really did it. We had to see Oasis. Everything was magic, and when fireworks started with the rain over our face, I mean, it was like a movie. JORDAN: It felt like a thank you to all the fans for following them like a big family. MAN: Everyone's just like hugging each other and singing along, like a big group like friends that you've never met. MAN 2: I just felt so lucky to be there. It felt like we're part of history. Making history. [CROWD CHEERING] See you later. [CROWD CHEERING] So long. MAN: I still think that Knebworth is one of the most important youth events ever. This was people traveling to see one band, not a whole festival. No one else could pull that off. 250,000 people for two nights. They couldn't do it. They are rock and roll. That's what it is. And as a live band, they set the standard. It was that communal feeling of 250,000 people over two nights. All there for... For one thing: To see Oasis. Nothing since has even come close. The whole day put together is probably the best gig you ever gonna go to. It transcends any other gig. MAN 2: Five lads from Manchester. The way that they just brought everybody together and gave 'em the best night of their lives. It's something I'm very proud to be a part of. WOMAN: I have some great memories from the '90s. But Knebworth was the '90s memory. It was... A time you just felt... anything was possible. It was taking that whole era, just putting it into just one great day, where... it was perfect.

NOEL: Oasis was the real deal. There was nothing fake about or contrived about it. It was five lads from two different council estates in Manchester. We weren't really great at anything. We're more than the sum of our parts. And we were honest. ♪ Today is gonna be the day... LIAM: You know, you can't bring that amount of people in that field and have it still resonate 25 years later if you weren't the real deal. People always ask me what Knebworth was like, and I'm always saying that I can't remember much about it. But watching this film brought it all back for me. It was the Woodstock of the '90s, you know, the music and the people coming together. It was biblical.

The songs pick themselves, but not doingRock 'n' Roll Star is pretty fuckin' radical, it's mad, mad. We would usually start with it or finish with it.
