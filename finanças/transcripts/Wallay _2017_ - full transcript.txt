In memory of Mum and Dad Hi, Yéli, I got your letter. See, you were wrong. I'm writing you a real letter too. I'm not used to writing, but it's okay, it's cool. It's winter here, nothing special. How are you? Thanks for the photo, you're so beautiful. Tell my grandma I really miss her and I'll never forget her. Six months earlier No, Thursday. He arrives Thursday. Bobo Airport, around midday. No. No, I haven't told him. I just said it was for the holidays. Hey, Jean! Is Gaoua far from here? 120 miles. Gaoua? I'll take you there, no worries! No, we're gonna take a bush taxi. I'll take you for the same price, in this car! Maximum comfort! How much you got? - 12,000. - For 20,000 you've got a deal. - 15,000 max. - 17,000. Less and I'm losing money. Okay, you got a deal. - You alright? - Yeah. Is this it? It's over there. Wallay! The motherland... I'm so happy. I've dreamt about this for ages. - Welcome. - Thank you. This is your little cousin, Bintou. The other two are neighbors. This is your cousin, Nafi. - And this is your aunt. - Welcome! Hello, ma'am. Ma'am? Hey, little one, it's Mom, Uncle Amadou's wife, so she's your mom. This is your uncle, Uncle Amadou. Welcome. How's your father? Is he okay? Jean, show him his room. Don't just stand there! What's up? Get him a drink. Nafi, hurry up! He welcomes you, says I should show you your room. Here, drink. Thank you, that's nice. - Did you have a good trip? - Yeah. - What's going on? - Power cut... It's nothing. Be careful. Can I get some water! Can I get some water! Can I get some water! Okay, I'm coming. Hey, this is the last one! One bucket per person is plenty. - I've got better to do. - Sorry, I didn't know... And since there's no door, put the stick there, so we know someone's inside. There's no electricity in my room? Is there still a power cut? There's no power during the day. Are you kidding? Sunlight isn't enough for you? I need it for my iPhone. Son, what do you want for breakfast? Porridge, bread? What'll it be? Well, I usually have Coco Pops... We've got porridge or bread. What'll it be? Bread's great. It's hot, isn't it? I'm exhausted. - You'll get used to it. - Hey, you! Come with me, now. He hasn't had his breakfast yet. - He wants you to go with him. - Where? He's mad, I do nothing before brekkie. Please tell him I need a min, then I'm all his. You have to go. Don't make him wait. Uncle! Uncle Amadou! Where are we going? Ady! - Good morning, Sidibé. - Good morning, Traoré. - Welcome, how's the family? - Fine. He's the guilty one. He's the one who steals money from each money order. Traoré. My own kid! He's come to apologize. Kid, come here! Your uncle is Amadou Traoré, he and I grew up together. - I'm Gilles Sidibé. - Gilles, cut it short! We did everything together, but really, what you did... We almost got into a fight, your uncle wanted to set the cops on me. He accused me of stealing his money, of taking my cut each time. What are you talking about? What money orders? Wait! I don't get it! He's lying. He's the thief and he knows it. Wait a minute, kid! You have to apologize, it doesn't work like that here! You have to ask for forgiveness. You have no choice. Don't shout at me! I'm not your boy! And what am I apologizing for? You're here because of the money orders you've been stealing. I haven't done anything! What is this shit? Look how he runs away. He's not even circumcised! Bastard! If he makes me crazy, he'll feel my wrath. Uncle... maybe we should call his father. I'm his father here. I educated you, didn't I? Just because God gave only girls to my wife doesn't mean... Come in. Ady, we know you stole it. I didn't steal anything! We checked. Each time there was a problem with the money order, it's when your father put you in charge of it. That's mine! Jean, now tell him. Listen, Ady. - You're gonna work. - What? You're gonna work with us and pay back what you stole. What's wrong with you? I don't agree. I'm not staying here! If I call Dad, he'll fly me back now. - I don't think so, Ady... - What? What did that fucker tell you? Hey, young man! No connection today. Fuck... Does this phone work? Can I make a call? Give me the number. Here. - Abdou Traoré is currently not... - Fuck! It sucks! Hey, easy! What's wrong? 250. 250 CFA francs! This is Burkina Faso. That's all I have. Okay, you can go, but you owe me 250 francs. - Hi. - Hi. I'm Siébou, my mom is dead, like yours. You're Salif, right? No, I'm Ady, Salif's my brother. You're Amadou's son. No, I'm Abdou's son, Amadou's my uncle. Why are you so dirty? I work at this garage. For my uncle. I'm his security guy, too. Hey! Don't you have 4G here? Your music's cool! - You can't hear it! - But you seem cool. Thanks. Tell me, where are you from? Vaulx-en-Velin. What do you do there? A little business here and there... Business... - How many garages are there? - Hey, you ask a lot of questions! Garages? No idea, man. Siébou! Back to work. Ady? I brought you some food. Enjoy your meal. It's here. Go, I'll wait for you here. - Don't go anywhere! - Don't worry, I won't. You've come to file a complaint against Amadou Traoré? Do you know your uncle's my friend, so is your dad... I want to file one against him, too. Listen to him! Against his dad too... That's a bit backward. Look, kid... I don't have time to waste. Get outta here, go see your uncle and apologize, okay? And jump to it! Or I'll punish you and lock you both up! It's in my block. What a wild dance! - Is it you? - Yeah. Hey, let's go. We're late. That's 1,500 francs. Thank you. I'm sorry about the post office guy. But now I'd like to go back to France. What a moron! I can't believe it. Touré! Mind the pontoon, it's unstable. Jean, explain to him. Ady, your uncle has a proposition: If you pay him back, he'll give you back your passport. How much? It adds up to 500 euros. You'll work the boats for 1,000 francs. 1,000 francs a day? Wait... That's... 1,000 francs a day, that's like two euros. No way! That's right, 1,000 francs a day, like all the apprentices here. He's mad! He's gotta be kidding! Ten days, 20 euros... One hundred days, 200 euros... Forget it, old man! Do you think I'll work here for two euros a day? I'm here on holiday, that's all. Get to work, there's a lot to do. Abdou Traoré is currently un... No, it's okay, it's on me. Thank you. Ady! Leave him be. It's his problem. You're too strict, you always have been. What do you want to do? Can't you see he's only a child? I'll go talk to him. It's a waste of time. Good luck. Hey! Bobo! Bobo! 3,000. I've got that. Wait. - I've got this phone case. - 3,000. It's as good as new! Hey! Kid! What are you up to? Leave me alone. Where are you going? Is it Kambou? Yes, it's me. No problem. Alright. Yes, it's him. No problem, thank you. Ady... - Why did you steal the money? - To buy some stuff. I would've paid the old man back one day or another! I'm no thief, man. Too much of one thing means too little of another. What does that mean? I'm here because of some sneakers? The two brothers went too far and used me, the sly fuckers! Watch your mouth. No one understands when you speak. You hurt your parents, Ady. And family's sacred here. What family? I was talking about uncle Amadou. Us... My parents died when I was seven. Fanta is an aunt, she took me in. Uncle Amadou treated me as his own son. I'll never be his son. I'm his brother's son, that's all. And I want to go home. You'll go home sooner or later. Not sooner or later, now! Fuck... Once I get there, I'll pay you back, I promise. - And no joke, what a traitor my dad is. - Hey! Don't disrespect him. I can't even get hold of him. He never answers! Don't cry, okay? Has he eaten? Go get him, I saved him some dinner. Uncle, I think we should leave him alone. - Man, are you done? - Yeah. Looks like you were hungry. - Enjoy, men. - Thanks. Hey, man! - Come eat. - No, I'm fine. - Hi. - How are you? Your shoes are awesome! Where did you get them? - At the market. - Which one? Gaoua market. You find everything here. Everything you find in France, you find it here. You're mad. I can't believe it... Kid, it's not a godforsaken place. Nafi! Nafi! - Go get Jean! - He's at work. Go get him, I said. Now! He's my little brother but honestly I don't know what he was thinking. The boy isn't circumcised. - Uncle... - Shut up. I saw him in the shower, the day he arrived. He must be initiated... and circumcised. Take him to his grandmother's tomorrow. Take the long road. On the way back, we'll talk to Old Somé to sort that out. What? His father entrusted him to me. He's insolent, a thief, a liar. - Uncle, it'll cause trouble! - Trouble? His father can't control him. I know what I have to do. Go. I'm done. Over there's the sacred forest. Our path begins here. - How long does it take? - Let's go! And what do we eat? Hey! Ady! Save your water. What did uncle Amadou say? That your grandma's waiting. And she'll set things right? Jean! Wait up! Please! Wow! Hey! Jean! Let's swim! No way! Let's keep going. No need to run. We can relax a bit too! Stop talking, or your mouth will dry out. Jean! Jean! Give me a drop, please. - We're almost there. - Yeah, right... Leave me here to die, it'll be faster. Fucker! Good evening, Mame. Good evening. Jean... Welcome! It's... Ady! My little hubby. Welcome! Are you okay, my little white kid? Thank God! Thank you, Jean. She's happy you came. My little white boy... Are you okay? Say hi! Hello. I'm so happy. I couldn't be happier! She's very happy to see you. My little hubby. Is everything okay? My little hubby. Jean, why did you take the long way? Mame... Uncle Amadou wanted us to. He wants to initiate the kid. Which kid? Not my little white kid! He's not from here. Do you want to kill him? My little hubby. Wait here, I'll be back. Tché fetini is you. It means little hubby. It's fermented milk. - Taste. It'll do you good! - Thanks. It's fermented milk, with sugar. Your grandma makes the best. Drink! Really, I'm so happy. She says she's happy you came. You're gonna sleep here. Your dad was born in this house. Hey! Kids! What's up! Go home, it's time to sleep. See you tomorrow. Go on! Here's my little hubby. You're awake. Slept well? There's porridge, if you want some. Yéli, give him some. Thank you. She wants to throw the cowry shells for you, look into your heart. You have to think about what you want, real hard. My little hubby... One day you'll be a man of your word. And you'll shine like the sun. Today, it's not easy. But after darkness, comes light... In this way, you'll come and go. She says you're a light, like the sun. That after darkness, comes light. And you'll come into the light. She also says you'll travel a lot. You'll come and go. Like the sun. Will I go back to France? France? That's not your home! Well, yes, it is. No, Yéli! Don't play with my little hubby. I don't like it. We're going to quarrel, you and me. Where are you taking me now? Come see. Wow! That's rad! Over there, that's Ghana. And behind this hillside it's Gaoua. But that's just next door! It took us two days! Uncle Amadou wanted us to take the initiation route... Initiation? What's that? Here, all boys of a certain age must be initiated. It's a very ancient custom. So you struggle for two days and you're initiated? No. That's not all. Then... they're circumcised. What? I can't believe it! Is that why my dad sent me here? To cut my dick off? Uncle Amadou decides. You have to respect his wishes. Ady, to become a man, to respect other men, you have to be circumcised. That's how it goes here. But I'm not from here. I don't even speak the language. What the fuck's going on? I'll tell Mame! Your grandma can't help you. Your father entrusted you to your uncle. Jean. Your visit really pleased me. I'm very happy. Even from Gaoua, which is so close, nobody comes visit me. Tell Amadou to be gentle with the kid. Do you understand? He's not from round here. You know him, he wants to train the boy, that's all. But this little one, he's stubborn! She said: she's happy we came, she's proud of you because you left France to visit her and it's rare anyone comes to visit, even from Gaoua. That's for me. Well, tell her I'm happy too, that it was cool to be here... And that her fermented milk's delicious too. Tell him not to be afraid to stay here. Here is his home. If he stays here a while, he'll discover a lot. Because, sadly, nowadays... We listen more to our peers, than to our parents. She says that she's proud of you, that you have to be brave, that this is your home, that you should stay and get to know your bloodline. Nowadays, we listen more to our peers than our parents. I don't mind your father not coming. Because, of course, if he's happy, I'm happy as well. I can't disown him for that. Remind him that he promised to send money. Tell him not to forget! She's not angry at your dad if he never came. She's not angry. She's happy, if he's happy. She also says he promised to send her money. She wants you to remind him when you go home. Okay, let's go... Be safe. - Thank you. - Be safe. Ady! - Come, Father is calling you. - What? Father is calling you. You have to understand, you have to become a man. Hey! You'll do what we say, whether you like it or not. - You speak French now? - Better than you, little white boy! You need to learn to respect people. Get ready to be circumcised. Nobody's getting circumcised! Wallay! I swear! You can beat me! I don't care. What are you saying? And I've been thinking too, I'll give the money back, but I'll give it to Grandma. I'm the boss here and I decide. I'll do what I like with my money. Where are you up to with Old Somé? I haven't seen him yet. But I heard he was around. Find him, so we can be done with this. Hey! Jean! - Are you hooking up with my cousin? - What? It's Nafi, isn't it? Yes, it's Nafi. We want to get married. I'm saving up. Hey, Jean, what a player! You pretty boy! Hey! I don't understand, why wouldn't Uncle speak French? Let him try to catch me to initiate me. I'm telling you. Him and his crutch! Old Somé. - There you are, welcome! - Thank you. - Everything's okay? - Yes. It's hard to see you lately. There are so many sick people. I'm swamped. What about our thing? Let's go over there. I've got the roots I told you about. Here you are. Listen. Boil them five times in water. No longer. One glass can knock a bull out for days. He won't feel anything? - He won't wake up? - Not during, no. But waking up will be painful. You have to warn him. I understand. But... - When can we do it? - Come on, Amadou! We have to wait for the full moon! - Auntie, I'm leaving. - Already? Greet the family. You're not gonna wait for Ady? I waited too long. Tell him I'm leaving tomorrow. How much can you pay? 2,000 francs? 7,000 and it's yours. You sweet talk people all the time! How long does the battery run? This battery runs for three or four days. Even if you go on the Internet, the battery doesn't discharge. - Oh, yeah? - I swear. - Check it out. - Is it touch sensitive? - I'll be back. - Okay. Hey! They're my roommates. Things are cool here, I don't want any trouble. There won't be any trouble, don't worry! I'm warning you. Fuck, it's all above board! I've had it with you. Stop saying "fuck" all the time. We're not mates. Understand? I'm serious, Ady. Be careful! I'm your last ally here, do you know that? Fine. Don't be so touchy. Ady? - Are you Ady? - Yeah, why? I heard you're selling some stuff. Yeah, yeah, don't worry. I'll be right there. I've got work to do. You'll get your share, don't worry. Get outta here! See you later. Come in. Sit down. It's about my debts. Here's 65.000 francs. With that, you have exactly 100 euros. I'll send you the rest later. But now I want my passport. Where did you get the money from? I did a little business. How did you earn this money? I sold a few things. My things. You sell clothes you haven't paid for. You sell things you've stolen... I don't want this money. Get out of here. Ady, let's check over there. Who are you looking for? My little hubby. You're here! Ady, welcome. Kids, go home, see you later. Go ahead! My little hubby, what's going on? Why are you sulking? You are always sulking. Do you want to go home? I don't like seeing you like this. He's not a bad man, he's just a sad man. The illness made him tougher. She says you must work at the lake, with your uncle. He's not a bad man, he's just a sad man. He's handicapped from illness. And that work isn't like... I didn't understand... Something they want to do to you. Don't worry for that. Listen well. Do everything you have to. Work hard at the lake. So your uncle lets you go back home. She said that if you work, your uncle will let you go home. Don't worry about the thing. What? She wants to know what you've decided. Er... well, like she said. Mame, he says he agrees. Thank God, I'm very happy! I have to go now. My mother is waiting for me. Tonight it's party time. Everybody's gonna be there. You have to come, little hubby. Hey, Ady! Get out of there. I'm warning you! There are crocodiles around here. It feels so good! The water's lovely. Get out of there, I told you. Hurry up. - How much? - 300. Give me 5,000 worth. 5,000? Thank you. I hope she'll like the mattress. I'm proud of you, little hubby. If Mame wasn't around to calm me, I'd have gone bonkers by now. I didn't get any of that! How do you say it... Go crazy, you know. Lose my marbles. What are you doing? - What's wrong? - We're too young, little hubby. Oh, come on! Amadou! Amadou! Good afternoon! - How's the family? - Fine. - Is it our kid? - Yes, it's him. God bless him! - So he's a fisherman to be? - Yes, step by step. Tomorrow is the big day! Are you ready? We will be. Amadou? The kid doesn't know? I wanted to tell him tonight. Er... Ady? I told you about Old Somé, right? It's him. He's a great master. He'll ensure your passage into manhood. Amadou, tell the truth! Tell him it's tomorrow! You wanted to put him to sleep, without him knowing. Manhood? Nobody touches me! Stop, Ady! Ady! Ady, stop! That's enough! - Stop! - Amadou! Uncle! Fuck... Here you are. - What is it? - Herbal tea. Drink. Feeling better? Yes, a little. What does it mean? It means: I give you the road. You can go home. Tell your father that he can be proud of you. Grandma, we have to go. Let's go. Little hubby! Little hubby! Leaving without saying goodbye? You weren't in the village yesterday. - Are you crying? - No way! - Where are you going, Miss? - To France. - What? - Just kidding. Just two seconds, I'm saying goodbye to my lover. - Will you write me? - Yeah! - I'll never forget you. - Me neither. That's what they all say.
