- Cramping again? - Yeah… I'll bring some water. What did you get? - You found out why they're dying? - No. How's the water test? It's fine. This is not what's killing them. - Who are you texting with? - No one. No reception, again. Hi! Would you take your boots off? I've just cleaned. Sorry. Oh, new recipe? - You don't like it? - I do. Delicious. Coriander goes well with duck. No problem, I'll get it off. - What took so long? - Nothing special. I went to the fish plant, they have a new catfish. I ordered some. What's this? What do you think? Why now? Why not? Did anything happen here? - Anyone came by? - Nobody. Were there many dead fishes? I didn't get them out. Why not? I just didn't want to. What if someone came? There hasn't been a fisherman here for weeks. I don't want to be hard on you. But what if someone came and saw they were dying? You know I'm scared to go in alone. But you're not afraid when you want to make a call. - What? - Nothing. - What's wrong? - Nothing. I'm fed up with your fucking fish. The biology teacher is going on maternity leave. I'm going to apply for the job. Why? You hate teaching… I don't care. I want to go back to the city. I don't understand you. When you were in the city, you wanted to come here. Don't do this. It'll get better. Hello! Hello! Hello! - Magda! - Hello my dear. I can't reach you. I'm coming to your father's anniversary. - Should I bring anything? - No, thank you. I want to ask something… Why did mum leave? Oh my dear… Why did this come to you now? I was just thinking… I don't know, dear. That's better left undisturbed. Okay. I'm coming next week. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, dear. Do you want me to get you a beer? Just wanted a sip. Get away. What if someone comes in? Doesn't matter. You weren't careful. No. Hello! Fine, thanks. How are you? Yeah, the reception is not very good. - Hi! - Hey! Tried calling if you need anything else, but couldn't reach you. - Are they properly isolated? - Yes. If these get out, they'll eat all the fish. Terminator catfish! - Hi! - Hey! What's she doing there? That's the only place where we have reception. They're always hungry. Like piranhas. Would even eat a dead cow. Feed them at the deepest part, so they learn the spot. 120 kg, as agreed. Here's a joke for you. Why did the fisherman go to the doctor? Why? Because he lost his herring. Get it? His herring! - Yeah. - Sounds almost exactly like hearing. Hallo? The line has cut off. When is Klari due? Wasn't it spring? I've told you about that grant. Fishing lakes can apply. Rural development. Try this company. - Thanks. - Would do you good. Four meters… It will take some time for them to get used to coming here. Fuck! Terminator catfish! Rest in peace. How good it was under the ice, hush under ice, above the ice. Profoundest silence everywhere the slightest sigh now rends the air. I met no harm and felt no grief no pain requiring no relief. Wind swept across me, fast, precise but never touched me under ice. The stone flung at mea faint skirr I slept on calm without a stir. Blessed are those whom silence shields above and below such icy fields. So… how does it go further? Let's go eat! I often feel he is not really dead, but has escaped somewhere abroad. You should sell the lake, not put your hopes in some grant… - I'm not selling it. - You're doing the wrong thing. When it doesn't work, you must leave it. Your father was also crazy. He couldn't leave either. I don't even understand how you could come here. You can't just escape the world… That isn't a solution. When you come to teach… you can live with me. We'll see what happens. Maybe Bence will come to his senses… Stay out of this! Bence! My father put this aside for my wedding. You will drink it at your wedding. May 1946… That's when I was christened. Thanks, Magda. Magda, what if someone proposes to you? When's the wedding? Stop putting it off! Hmmm… the catfish is real tasty. What was that? They don't see the glass and fly right into it. - What is it? - A chaffinch. When a bird flies into a house, the soul of a dead is trying to return. It didn't fly in the house, just crashed against the glass. Your poor father. He always stuffed these. - Hi! - Hi! - Did you buy the test? - No. Why not? The village store didn't have it. Road to the city was icy. Great. - Are you still late? - Yes. You have been late before. Yeah. Hello? Bence! Bence! Bence! What? Could you take me in with the boat? - Why? - I need to make a call. - Now? - Yes! - I am feeding now! - I need to call the school! The line is cutting off here. No! When I'm done. Bence! Bence! I'll take you in once I've finished. The school's not going anywhere. Fuck you. Hello. Sorry, we were disconnected, no reception… It's gonna be hard to talk like this… As I mentioned, you have to undergo a psychological test before applying… …and please submit the result of this. Okay. Submit your previous class… Hello… Hello. Bence! Bence! Janka! Janka! Please… Wake up… Stupid bitch, wake up! Hello! - Hello? Can you hear me, Bence? - Yes. Finally. Are you two all right? - Yes. You? - I'm fine. You haven't called the entire winter. I could even die from you. What's going on with you? Nothing. I had the cold, but feeling better now. Is it a harsh winter there? I can't hear you. What is it? - Hi. - Hi! Nice sweater. So? How are the fish doing? All right. I see you have a buoy. The grant application? I called them in the fall, but no one came. I'll give them a ring. This is a nice place, I envy you. Janka? - She's gone. - Gone? Well, that's not good. Here's a joke for you. A little girl walk into a pet shop and asks the employee for a bunny. Employee asks: what kind of bunny are you looking for? Girl says: I don't think my snake really cares! Give me her number. I promised her a movie. Don't know. We only had one phone, and that's still here. Hi. Hello. I'm here on grant business. I tried calling, but couldn't get through. - Nóra Kovács. - Bence Jakab. - Nice sweater. - Thanks. It's beautiful here. Are these for rent? Yes. - Can you live in them? - No, they're only good for fishing. You can only live in that one, on the island. What's the buoy for? So the fish gather there. Aha, that's where you feed them. I used to fish with my grandfather when I was little. - What fish do you have? - Pike, carassius, carp… We added some resistant hybrid catfish in the fall. Hybrid isn't good, are there many? Not many, only in the separated section. Unfortunately, they will have to go because of the grant. This lake fully meets the criteria. I'll have to see how everything works, about profits… My commission is 15%. You have no reception. Only in some places, mainly on the lake. - Should we find some? - It's fine. Anyone else living here? No. There were two names on the application. Not anymore. I can start on the weekend. I think I'll come Saturday afternoon. Can I rent it? Yes. Can I stay there? Yes. Hi. Hi. I brought the papers. Is the bungalow vacant? Yes. - I'd stay for the weekend. - Okay. - I'm going in, okay? - Sure. - Need help? - No, thanks. Sorry to bother you, can I borrow a mosquito spray? Of course. - Would you like a beer? - No, but I will sit for a bit. It's chilly in the evening. Have you lived here long? I always have to some extent. I inherited it. It was my father's, he disappeared some year ago. I came back. What happened to him? We don't know. He was living here, then he disappeared. Maybe he fell in the lake. Or simply left. And your mother? She left when I was little. The lake's beautiful. It's like a dream. It is. Don't you miss the city? No. I also get fed up sometimes, but I don't have a lake to escape to. - What are you doing? - Sorry. A fisherman came and paid. Thanks. There are two dead mice in front of my room. A gift from the cat. - Would you get rid of them? - Yes. - Tossing them in the lake? - The fish will eat them. The lake digests everything. - I have a few more questions. - Okay. Do you have income from any other sources? - No. - None… - Current place of work? - Here. - Previous place of work? - Báthory István Primary School. Teacher? What subject? Biology. So you're familiar with everything around here. I'm not sure… but I know this place the best. That's as far as we can get now. To go on I will request the cadastral extract and a few other documents. Another fisherman. You seem to be attracting them. …and he wants to tell me about it. Hello. Hello. I'm here. This is my sister, she gave me a lift. - Hello, Vera Kovács. - Bence Jakab. Sorry. Come, I show you where I'm going to stay. These are the originals… We have almost everything. Do you have any old photos of the lake? Why? The grant is for small-scale producers. Each detail considered to be traditional, is worth additional points. Anything relating to the history of the lake… Okay. Is this the bungalow? Yes. What are all these stuffed animals? My father's collection. Is this you? - No. - This one. Okay, thanks. These will do. I need one last signature… The project is completed. This pálinka is old. Passed down in the family? Yes, from my aunt. What fish did you have in this? Gold. What happened to them? I ate them. Should I bring new ones? Yes. - Good day. - Good day, I would like no. 15. - That'll be 5000. Thank you. - Thank you. Good day. What? I am not Janka. Excuse me? Janka isn't here. I don't know. She left. Yes, this is the fishing lake. Bence's asleep. Wait, he's up. Hang on. Hello! Bence? Finally. Who was that girl? Nóra, she is helping with the grant for the lake. And where's Janka? She's gone. How come she's gone? What happened? Where did she go? That girl has no family. My God… I tried calling you. There was no reception. What happened between you two? - Can you hear me? - How are you? I am fine. Bence, say something. Where did she go? I don't know. - If you talk to her, tell her to call me. - I will. - Bye. - Bye. - Everything all right? - Yes. - What's this? - Carp. Five and a half… 5000. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Goodbye, have a nice day. - Bye. 18 kg of carassius, 25 kg of carp. It's going really well today… Do you like it here? I do. Very much. It's like it was in my childhood… - Should we eat? - Yes. Good day. - Good day. - Number 5 please… - Thank you. - Thank you. Where's the pepper? - Up there. - Oh yeah. - Are you sure you don't want any catfish? - Yes. This is the tastiest fish I have ever eaten. And they bite so quick, I caught this one in 10 minutes. And I'm not a good fisherman… It shows that you trained them to go there. Was that a problem? No… I just needed a sip. Hi. Excuse me, could you give me a hand? It's caught in my back. I'm fishing alone out here, and someone has to take it out. It's bleeding a bit… I'll get some band-aid. Hey. Hi. - Is this the lake you have talked about? - Yes. What happened? I'm fishing here and had a little accident. - How are you? - Fine, thanks. And you? I'm okay. What about Janka? - She's gone. - I see. - It was nice to see you. - Same here, bye. - Bye. - Bye. I didn't know you know each other. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Would you tell me something about Janka? What happened between you? Nothing. She left me. She wanted to leave for a long time. Thanks. Please don't swim in the lake. Don't worry, I'm a good swimmer. Where are you going? I just thought that maybe I got my period. Is it time? It was due one week ago, but I am late sometimes. Bence! Bence! Can you come here? What happened to him? Fishbone stuck in his throat. - Hey. - Hey. I talked to the company. And? We won the grant. Aren't you happy? I am… I am… I thought, you would be happy if we won. I am happy. You said that if we get the grant we'll do it together. Do you still want to? Of course. You? I'm not sure… I think you don't want to. They asked me to go back, they have lots of work, they would need me. Do you want to go? Fine. Do whatever you want. Don't eat any more fish. What? Don't eat any more catfish. Why? - Just don't! - But why? - Because it's not good! - But it is! I'm sorry… It's not good for you here. You should leave. - Hi Magda. - Hello. How are you? You haven't called in ages… Last time you said that someone is interested in the lake… Remember? Oh yes, Béla's grandson. Do you think he's still interested? - I don't know, I will ask Béla. - Okay. - Should I tell him to have a look at it? - Yes. I'm glad you have come to your senses, son. Call me in the afternoon, I can never reach you. - Bye. - Bye. - Thank you. - Cheers. Cheers. Why are you selling? With the grant awarded, it is very promising. It is. - Where will you go now? - I don't know yet… - The keys to the house… - Thanks. - And the keys to the bungalows… - All right. - Good Luck. - Thank you and to you too. Bye. Bye.
