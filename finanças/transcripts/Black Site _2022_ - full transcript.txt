An explosion has decimated a major hospital today in Istanbul. 10 Americans, including one US surgeon and his daughter, are counted among the dead. There are more than 100 confirmed casualties and 79 injured with the toll expected to rise. The facility was crowded at the time of the blast, having admitted many patients injured in a car bombing incident nearby just three days ago. This is the most significant attack on a medical facility in years. And so far no organization has claimed responsibility for the bombing. Audrey's been helping the nurses with their rounds on the wards. You're having so much fun at the hospital, aren't you? Mommy, Mommy, I went to the hospital again with Daddy. I got a teddy from Doctor Hamza. It's called Medi Bear. Medi Bears helps children in the ward to feel better. Oh, you little rascal. - Get outta here. - Hey! Anyway, darling, I gotta go back to emergency so I'll be unreachable for the rest of the day. I love you, Abby. See you soon, my love. I dragged Ryan all over the world for my work. He never complained. He never cared where we ended up as long as he could help people in need. But being... a doctor always... came second to being a dad. Audrey. You were a shining light in a dark world. I'm sorry for putting you both in harm's way. I'm sorry I couldn't save you. This wasn't your fault, Abby. Ryan couldn't have known what he was walking into. His work was so important. The agency owes you a debt. Look, I've read all your reports. Everyone at the agency has. I'm getting a lot of pressure to keep you here stateside. Wait, and use secondhand intel? That's not enough. Frankly, I have people who are better suited for this job. You aren't considering your personal connection to this incident. This is not like your other postings. These people are dangerous. We built this place to fight terror with terror. We do things that no one will ever know about. Abby, you're a hell of an analyst. But burying yourself out there in the desert chasing ghosts, it is not going to change what happened. I need to be the one asking the questions and I need to be looking them in the eye when they give the answers. I said my piece. You'll be on a transport to Citadel in 72 hours. I'll brief you en route. Oh, and Abby? I know you like to play things by the book. These people, where you're going, they don't exactly like reading. Catch my drift? Drift caught, sir. Watch your back, Abby. And keep your focus. I will. Good luck. There's a secret base, Abby, in the Jordanian desert, codenamed Citadel. Its purpose is top secret intelligence sharing between five English-speaking democracies known as the Five Eyes Alliance. The Five Eyes includes the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Because of its location, there's also a representative from the Israeli intelligence community, which you know as Mossad. In addition to protecting its array of servers, the site is also used to hold and interrogate suspected terrorists from around the world. Good luck. Do you believe Farhan? Are you sure he isn't misleading you? I found a document that backs up his story. It couldn't have been a lone bomber, Silas. Subject 99423, interrogation 009. Let's try this again, Farhan. Did Hatchet give you any indication of who his source was in Istanbul? I don't know why he was there and I don't want to know. You are not different to me. You don't tell the CIA what to do with the information you recover. Cut the crap, Farhan. He was looking for someone and I think you know who. I know nothing about the bomb in Istanbul. I am just going about my business to feed my family. My last communication was to connect him to a friend of mine at Kyzaghan Enterprises. Who was the contact in Ankara? It was one of your couriers. Farhan. I know it wasn't you. Give me the info I need and I'll help you get out of here. Maybe the office in Ankara. You don't understand. I am a businessman. I don't know. Are you responsible for the people who die because of what you do? Huh? You haven't eaten. You know, the way we work here is real simple. Okay, you stay in your cell, you shit in your can. When I say it's time for chow, you fucking eat. Eat your fucking food, Farhan. What's the matter, can't you speak? Huh? Not making my job easy. Miller! Outside. What the hell is going on in there? He's refusing to eat. I'm encouraging him. Look, I know that you think that you're still first battalion, but you're not, all right? You're an employee of the CIA, and as long as I'm in charge here, we play by the book. Oh, we're gonna play by the book. Okay. That's cute. What the fuck do you want? Do you want me to write you up and send your ass home? Is that what you're after? No, but what I would appreciate... - Uh-huh? - ...is for once, while you're up there drinking your tea and eating your cake, you try to... try to imagine what it is we do down here. You know? Do you think it's a coincidence every time you grace us with your presence, these motherfuckers start getting all chatty? Are you done? It's because Briggs and I butter 'em up. We set the table. I've never ordered that. No, but it's expected. No. I expect better. Fucking analysts. He looks dehydrated, get him some water. This is how you live with yourself, huh? Small acts of mercy in a torture chamber. I'm the only friend you have right now. That company you told us about in Ankara, Kyzaghan Enterprises, the one you trade with in fertilizers. Turns out that they're a major supplier for a terrorist organization,. Look, I'm a businessman, okay? I buy and I sell from whoever wants to trade with me. It's been three weeks now and I told you everything I know. No, you haven't, Farhan. You've given me a few bread crumbs mixed in with a ton of horseshit. Now, in our last interview, you mentioned Hatchet. How do you know Hatchet? I want you to identify him for me please. Is it this guy? Or is it this one? All I know for sure is you don't want to meet that sadistic madman or do business with him. I just connected him with my contact purely for business purposes. Talk to. He probably has unfinished business in Ankara. Hey baby, I found a document that connects the fertilizer transaction to Kyzaghan Enterprises in Istanbul, probably worth checking out. Oh, and by the way, I found a restaurant. It is gonna blow your mind. Don't worry baby, it's only a few more weeks. This posting in Istanbul will be over before you know it. - Abby? - Nearly there. - Abby. - Love you. Hey, sorry. Rashid wants you in the rec room, it sounded urgent. In the rec room? Yeah, I don't know. That's just what he said. For the record, I'm gonna miss having you around. - I'm gonna miss you too. - Hm. Don't let those guys give you a hard time. I can handle those boys. Yeah, I have a feeling you can. Any update from Langley on my drone missile theory? Nope, nothing so far. I'm coming in with Abby now. Surprise! Right, so, uh, no actual emergency. Well, apart from all the normal emergencies, safety of the free world, all that stuff. - Tada! - Whoa. - What is that? - That is a work of art. It is the Capitol Building in DC, of course. Obviously. Yeah, obviously it's the Capitol Building. Oh-ho-ho! Hey, hey, cut the guy some slack. You put a trained killer on a baking assignment., you get what you pay for. You love it? Thank you, it's a very sweet gesture. Enjoy the cake. Did you have something to do with this? Hey, the guys wanted to give you some kind of... No, I'm talking about sending me back to Washington. Hey, of course not. Come on Abby, you know me better than that. You're my right arm. I tried to get you more time, there was nothing I could do. You know I'm not done here yet. Hey. - I gotcha this. - Oh, my... Wait, this isn't... - This is the bottle... - Yeah. - ...that Ryan and I gave you. - Yeah, it is. - You know, I'm not much of... - I know, big drinker. Yeah. Thank you. This means a lot. I'm gonna finish my rounds. Anyone touches this... - Mia. - Mm-mm. Be hell to pay. Move, move, move. One non-com down. There's another one down. Building security. Holy shit. Keep your head on the swivel. Copy that. Move, move, move. I'll take point. Freeze, hands up! Translator. Zero-four, take the lead. Copy that. Cover flanks, I got middle. Freeze! Put your hands up! Turn around and drop the knife. Drop the knife. Drop the fucking knife! Delta to HQ, target secure. Commencing extraction to Citadel. Citadel, this is 5779-Echo-Charlie requesting clearance to land, over. This is Citadel, Watchtower receiving. We weren't informed of your arrival. Challenge code? Yankee- Juliet-77-Delta. Response? Echo-Charlie, this is Watchman 1-Yankee-Juliet-3087-Charlie, request granted. Clearance? TS asset, Hatchet in motion. She say Hatchet? Get Abby on intercom. Watchman two, report to Big Dog's office. We just got a call from Special OPS. They're bringing in Hatchet. How do you know it's him? We don't even know what he looks like. He fits the profile exactly and they found him in Ankara, just like you said they would. Arriving in two hours. We got him Abby. Hey Uri, shoot some pool? Old Testament against New? You want to get crucified again? - Put 50 bucks on it. - Okay, okay. A Chaplain, risking God's wrath by gambling. All right Moses, let's see if you can split the Red Sea. Lord's on my side, brother. Lord's on my side. - Can you move please? - It's cool, I'm just, - you know... it's all right. - thank you. Cool, hot shot. Wow, that was hard to miss that pocket. You're shootin' like a grandma. You okay Abby? Hatchet's been captured. They're transferring him here. Abby, can we talk? Uri. Let's me interview Farhan just once. He will listen to me. Uri, you know I can't do that. What does it matter to you? You're leaving. You have to give me access to him. - I have responsibilities here. - Yeah, well we all do. Look. I get it. You want to take down the people who have taken so much from you. I want to protect those who are still alive. Farhan Barakat is up to his neck in this. Give me the raw intel, I have people on the ground who an investigate it. No. And to be honest, I don't like the way Mossad investigates. We get the job done though, no? Let's help each other. This is a Five Eyes site and your country is not invited. You got a problem with that, take it up with your pal, Rashid. He's the head of operations, not me. I don't know any details about the hospital bombing. We've been over this many times. How many times? That company you told us about, Kyzaghan Enterprises in Ankara? Hatchet's been captured there. You better hope it isn't him. That they are not bringing him here right now. You know, the first time I heard of Hatchet, these three station agents turned up dead in a safe house in Dushanbe. They all had their faces peeled back. And they know it's him? They say he uses this particular kind of fish skinning knife to erase the identity of his victims. Handmade in Sochi. And supposedly the blade has a... signature, you know, like a gun barrel. In Mossad we tracked him for a while when he was working for the Revolutionary Guards in Iran. Then he switched to the Saudis, then switched to the Libyans. He's a disloyal shadow. Sure knows how to pick his employers. You know, in, uh, Hebrew, we call him the Shedim. Demon. They say after the massacre there was no running water, so... he bathed in the blood of his victims. No, this guy sounds like a fairy tale, campfire ghost story. You'd be the expert on that shit right, Chaplain? ETA? Touchdown in 10 clicks. Delta to Citadel, 10 clicks away. Get your head down, you piece of shit. HQ, I received a directive. I'll make sure it's done. Yankee-Juliet-77-Delta, what is your direction and ETA? Exfil, 32 miles north, 0400. Drawbridge will be lowered, over. ETA in seven. Attention security team Alpha. We have an asset inbound. Please report to loading dock for escort to holding level. I repeat, security team Alpha report to loading dock for escort to holding level. All other personnel report back to your stations. You want some coffee? Yeah man, I'd love some. Attention all personnel. We have a high priority asset incoming. report back to your stations. Can't believe we got the guy. Yeah, well, we never know, right? You doing the honors this time or me? No man, I dealt with the last one, you can deal with this sticky bastard. You're scared. That's okay. We all get scared. Package hot. Seriously, what are the chances? Three days before you ship out? Someone's looking out for you. Seems like it. Asset incoming. Hey. You got this. Well, well, well, if it isn't Delta. Hey boys, welcome. Captain David Palau. Rashid Nassar, head of operations. This is Abby Trent, CIA psyops, second in command, she'll be conducting the interrogation. This is Tessa Harijan, my translator. - Hi. - How you doing? - Hey, Abby. - Tessa. - You know each other? - Yes, CR training at Quantico a million years ago. Good job with the intel on Hatchet. Actually it was all Abby's work. - Well done. - Thank you. Can I talk to you for a minute? Sure. You might want to take a look at that. Thanks, Captain. What's that about? No idea, they told me nothing. Subject for interrogation could speak Russian, Arabic or Farsi, so... What am I looking at here? Who's authorized this? These orders are written and approved by Langley. This is unbelievable. I can't approve this. We're authorized to handle the asset here. - We have national security... - What is this place anyway? - Direct violation... - Uh, undisclosed, friendly. Right, well it's three hours by chopper from Ankara, so Jordan. ...contravention of our international responsibilities. I like what you've done with the place. How long you been here? - 10 months. - 10 months? - Take your 40 minutes. - Wise choice. - Abby, need a word. - I could not handle that. I like the simplicity of it. Let's go. What's going on? Captain Palau asked for 45 minutes alone with the prisoner. - No video, no recording. - What, are you kidding me? You told him no, right? He has a written order from Langley. My hands are tied. That's bullshit, Rashid. There's nothing I can do. Bullshit, there's nothing you can do. That is the world's most dangerous man and no one knows more about him than I do. I need to be in that room. An order is an order. It's up to the powers that be, not me. Fuck the powers that be. I'm sorry, Abby. It's out of my hands. There you go, sweetheart, here's your castle. Access interrogation room one. Security team Alpha. Delta. Spread 'em. Spread 'em. Cut sound and video to the interrogation room from now until 0045 hours. No permanent record, no remote access by anyone from anywhere on the base. But that's breaking protocol. Silas called in the order. - Just do it. - Okay. Don't you worry, Hatchet. Captain's gonna take real good care of you. There's a bonus prize for you, kiddo. Yeah, you just won the big one. There you go, nice and tight, boy. You want a face covering, Captain? This guy's never gonna see the light of day again. Hey. You can go now, we got this. Let me help you out. Right this way, kiddo. Bye-bye. What's going on here, huh? These guys are fucking cowboys. Ready for you, Captain. - He's all yours. - Okay. You got a handsome face, anyone tell you? The grey just, perfect. Suits you. Hey, you know, you're not what I expected. But then again, no one really knows where you're from or who you really work for, right? - FSB. - FSB. The Syrians. I mean, you wanna pick a fucking team? I buried friends because of you. So where do you want it? Huh? You probably think you know how this is going down, right? I ask a few questions, you stonewall. I finally give up and hand you back, but that's not what's happening here. I got 40 minutes to make things nice and personal. Just you and me. So. Let's get the party started. Are you the operative known as Hatchet? Hm? Ask him in Farsi. Or Russian or Arabic. Ask him again. I'm finding this kind of frustrating. That hurt a little bit? It's okay. Who ordered the bombing in Istanbul? Who sent you to Syria? Was it the field agents in Al-Tanf? Huh? Come on, Hatchy-Hatch, talk. A confession would be nice. But you say nothing, it's the same thing in my book. Okay. Your choice. Hang him up. We brought our toy bag right, Garcia? Hm? Mm-hm? How's that, Hatchet? Huh? You like that? Good. That's good. Mm-hm? We talking? Hm, talking? Okay. Okay, Hatchy. Good work. Talk to me. Who ordered the bombing of the hospital? Come on, talk to me. No, no, no, no. To me. I'm the one who decides whether you live or die. We have gunfire in the interrogation room. Gunfire in the interrogation room! Send the scorch team, pronto! Shot fired in the interrogation room. Switch on the camera. Probably just firing blanks. Give 'em another two minutes. Why would Special Ops carry blanks on a mission? Switch on the fucking camera. Do it. Camera one obscured. Try camera two. Switching to camera two, hang on. Camera two also covered. Man down! We got a... - Jesus. - Get a medic! All personnel, code red. This is not a drill. Scorcher team on standby, armed backup to interrogation. Armed backup to interrogation! Stay in position. - What we got? - Shots fired, no eyes on scene. Situation report. Shots fired from inside. We can't breach without your clearance. - Hold on... - Briggs get the gurney. - Open the fucking door! - Copy that. Anyone gets past me, you're authorized to fire. - Are we breaching? - Breach. Yeah. In three, two, one. Put your fucking hands up! The captain's breathing. - Jordan, help! - Are you okay? I need you on the captain's legs. Get him up. Go. One, two, three, go. Come on. It's a crime scene, don't touch anything. Med bay, incoming. Gunshot wounds. - Tessa, are you okay? - I need ice. Wait for me in the interview room down the hall. - Okay. - I need to know everything. Weapon's safe. Palau, stay with me, it's gonna be okay. Turn! Spin! - Jordan, report back to Miller. - Copy. You take his legs. One, two, three. Prepare for. pressure right here. He's got a big hole in his chest. Captain Palau. Come on, captain. Talk to me, say something. You're gonna be okay, you're going into shock. Come on, come on, captain. You're gonna be okay, just look at me. Don't worry. You're gonna be oka... You'll never get out of here. Who said anything about leaving? So Captain Palau was able to get a shot off before Hatchet escaped both cuffs. Fucking Delta force. Something's not right. Shit. Secure level one. Uri, with me. Rashid. Rashid. Oh, my God. Rashid. Rashid. Rashid. Stay with me, Rashid. Don't... no Rashid, no. Rashid, don't... I'm sorry, Abby, but we don't have a lot of time. Abby, look at me. You are now in charge. You are in charge. We need a plan. Watchtower. Do you have eyes on level three? Watchtower, speak to me. Command center. Let's go. Mia, Hatchet's on the loose, lock down Control. Mia, do you copy? Mia! Mia? Mia. Mia? Oh, my God. Mia. I'm locking us down. Enter password. Officer Trent. Lockdown authorized. Lockdown protocol initiated. Executing Citadel lockdown procedure. Executing Citadel lockdown procedure. External access sealed. Why are we going to lockdown? - That fucking alarm. - Shit, yeah. Something went sideways down there in interrogation. Probably fucking Delta squad... All stations, this is Abby Trent, acting CO. The facility is under attack. A highly dangerous asset is at large and armed. We need non-lethal containment of the asset. Alpha and bravo doors opening. Alpha and bravo doors open. Alpha and bravo doors open. - Alarm, detainee... - Abby. Someone releasing the detainees. Alarm, detainee block. Alarm, detainee block. All guards to detainee block. We need immediate non-lethal containment. Shit. He's here for Farhan. Alpha and bravo doors open. Alpha and bravo doors open. Detainees out of the box, Briggs with me. Wesley, Jordan, go right. Get the fuck back in your cells. Go back in your damn cell. I'm calling HQ. Fuck. The lines are fried. No external comms. Fuck. Fuck, where's the book? We need comms. Come on. Communication lost. Countdown initiated. Countdown. Countdown to what? If we can't restore comms in the next hour, they send a drone to wipe us out. Fucking Americans. It's just a failsafe. All right? There's a lot of sensitive intel, we're a remote base in a foreign country. And you say Mossad are the hardliners. You're the ones taking out your own base. Shit. Get the fuck back in your cell. In your fucking hole. What'd I fucking say, huh? Stay in your fucking box. - Moving up. - Back up, back up. secure. Two secure. Come on, huh? Come on! Don't fucking think about it. Get the fuck back in there! Get the fuck in there! Four is clear! Oh, no, you don't. Don't you fucking try it. On the fucking ground! Stay on the fucking ground! Fuck. Oh shit! Who turned off the fucking lights? Calm the fuck down, man. Calm the fuck down. - B side are clear. - Clear, all good. Don't you fucking move. Don't move. Hey, Miller! You take another step, motherfucker, I'll put a hole in you, I swear to God. I'll put a fucking hole in you, I swear to God. That's right, motherfuckers! Fuck. Back in your cell! Get back in your cell, motherfucker! Shit! Goddamn. In your cell! Get back in your cell! I will shoot! I will shoot! Get down! Jesus Christ, what are you doing? - No more, no more! - Look Akim, I don't wanna hurt you, okay? Just relax, mate, and stay down! Okay, okay, my friend, no more, no more. Please, please. Let us out, hey, hey, hey! Hey, come on, man, we can help, let us out! Hey! Jordan? Jord... Jordan! Jordan, hey, hey, Jordan. Jordan. Jordan! Ah, fuck. Fuck. Tessa, level three. Miller! Wesley! - I'll check Bravo. - Okay. Let us out, man! Miller, what the fuck? Yeah, don't ask. Did you see Hatchet with Farhan? I thought she was dead. Apparently not. - Wesley. - Jordan. It's just me. What does Hatchet want with you? I'm not giving you anymore than I have already. Quit fucking playing games and tell her what she needs to know. What will you do to me, huh? I'm already dead. I knew we should have boarded this goat-fucker. Shut the fuck up, Miller. You. You were held on base at Al-Tanf for a month. After your transfer, five dead field agents turned up in Syria. Now I know he is looking for you. My question is this. Is he here to save you or kill you? Please ask him for me when you find him. Or he finds you. Fuck sake. Fuck! I'm putting you in charge of Watchtower. I need eyes and comms. - Where are you going? - Server room. Countdown, 45 minutes remaining. Password affirmative, Officer Uri Wasserman. Chaplain? What are you doing? Damn lockdown. Abby. There's no sign of him. There are lots of blind spots. This place is a fucking maze. I'll check the camera logs. Uri, you got eyes on us yet? No, the system on level four is down. Uri. I can't. I can't hear you, Abby. We might lose radio contact, it's patchy down here. So this is the server room? Citadel's black box. It's where we store all the intel. Hatchet would try to target here. Officer Trent. - Quite the setup you got here. - Every backup since this place was built 10 years ago lives here. Every part of the interrogation program. As well as all of my work on the hospital bombing. Security breach. Abby, I have playback. Going through the camera logs. Oh shit, someone's tried to access the server from offsite. Fuck. Abby, come in. Abby! Abby, get the fuck out of there! Tessa killed Mia. Repeat, Tessa killed Mia. I'm sorry Abby. I really didn't want to have to do this. Abby. Let me access server and erase a few files. I don't want to have to kill you. We're still on the same side. What the fuck happened to the translator? We had a falling out. What are you doing? She's a traitor. She killed Mia - and she put a gun to my head. - Jesus. She working for Hatchet? Or whoever Hatchet's working for. - I thought she was your friend. - Yeah, me too. Well, are you gonna tell us what really happened down there? I'm not sure what the fuck you're implying, Miller. I'm not implying anything. I'm asking a question. So what do we do now? Hunker down, wait for the next supply delivery? - That's not an option. - Why not? Once we declare security breach, if HQ can't establish comms within one hour, we're deemed compromised and they hit the kill switch. Whoa, whoa, whoa, what the fuck do you mean by kill switch? A drone erases this place and everything in it. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, fuck that. Fuck that! Okay, I say we cut our losses. We get rid of the detainees. We blow the fucking doors. What, no? And... and Hatchet goes free? No, he's mine. I don't give a fuck about Hatchet. You're gonna watch Tessa and make sure nothing happens to her. You are gonna keep an eye on him. Wesley and I are gonna arm up. Recapture Hatchet, that's your plan? Yes, that's my plan, Miller, and you better stay focused, 'cause if he comes back for Farhan or Tessa, you're the best chance we've got of getting the drop on him. Oh, I appreciate the show of confidence, but just a reminder. The score so far is five dead on our side, none on his, and that's 'cause fucking analysts are calling the shots. Not active duty servicemen. Former active duty. You gave up your army rank when you joined here as a private contractor. Live with it. I'll be in the armoury. Come on, Wesley, let's grab the C4 so we can blow our way out of here. Yeah. Armoury doors access, Watchman one. - Whoa, whoa, hey! - Jesus, Chaplain. - What are you doing? - I don't... I... I was in my quarters when the alarm went off. We're in lockdown. - Come with us to the armoury. - Okay. All right, let's grab all the C4 and after we stock up on weapons, we're gonna have to clear every room, - every hallway, together. - Okay. Sounds like fun. Emergency. Alarm system activated. Emergency. Alarm system activated. Emergency. Alarm system activated. Emergency. Alarm system activated. - The hell's going on up there? - Some new clusterfuck. We need to know what the translator is hiding. - Officer Trent said... - I don't give fuck what Officer Trent said, okay? I got one rule when it comes to this shit, that's stay alive, motherfucker. I don't know about you, but I didn't sign up for no suicide mission. Look, I guarantee you they've got an exfil plan. She's got to be in on it. Okay. - Fuck. - God damn it, he just tried to kill us. There goes all the C4. He's fucking with us. Fuck. I mean, Jesus. Christ. - Fuck. - You all right there? Morning, princess. Where am I? Oh, you're in Hell. I don't know what Abby told you. She's lost her mind. Yeah, you wouldn't be the first to suggest it but, I'm gonna have to give her the benefit of the doubt. Christ. Chaplain, you gotta keep up with us. What now... now I think I lost a bit of my hearing, Abby. Yeah, you'll lose more than that if you don't stay on your toes, mate. Cover us. No, no, oh God, please, God, no. Release him or I'll show you both! No, no, no, no. Just wait, wait one second, wait. Let him go, let him go now! No! No! Abby. I can get up. I can get up. No, no, no, no, no, no. Abby. Ab... Abby. You and me... You and me are gonna play a little game. Okay? And the game is called "you tell me how you'd get out of here, or I'll break your fucking hand." All right? You like games? It's real simple. See it goes like this. I say, "How would you get out of here?" And if you answer correct... ...I give you a prize, and if you answer wrong, I break your fucking hand. - Mm-mm. - Yeah. Just like this. Mm. not fun. Should we try little guy? Huh? - No! No! No! - This little pretty one here? - No, no! - Should we try - this little pretty one here? - Stop! All you gotta do is tell me how you'd get out of here. No? No? What's your exit strategy? What's your fucking exit strategy? No? Now we're going for number four! Uri. Hatchet has Chaplain. Last seen leaving the rec room. And Wesley's gone. What must we do? They're on level two. Moving south in your direction. Shit, just lost them again. 30 minutes remaining. Stupid cameras. Oh, no. No, no, no. Please, please, please. Help! Help! Help! Come on. Come on, come on. Where are you, you Shedim? Crew quarters. Fuck. Sorry, Abby, I've lost vision again. I last saw him at crew quarters. I'll try and get system back online, okay? Uri. He's not here, talk to me. There's still time to get the system back online. Hatchet's on the move. No Chaplain. He's been in my room. Abby, I'll try and rig up the SAT phone. Think it's our best shot. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey. Hey, you're falling asleep on me. Don't fall asleep, baby, you're gonna miss the best part. Now we gotta start on the other side. Okay! Okay, okay. - Stop! I'll talk! - Okay, okay. I'm listening. You want Hatchet to leave? Just get him Farhan. That's all he's here for. No shit, huh? I knew that bastard was withholding. What does he want with Farhan? You really have no idea. Do you? You're just a contractor. We're pretty similar, you know. Well. I hope they paid you up front, 'cause you sure as shit ain't getting a success B. Fuck. Any luck on comms? I'm working on it. We're going to need to patch directly into the comms tower. Might seem dodgy, should work. Copy. I can't figure out how the hell Hatcher got to Tessa. Abby. Miller is in Farhan's cell. C'mon, buddy. You and I are going for a little walk. Oh, fuck! Miller! What's going on? Abby? Abby? What the hell did you do to her? We had a conversation, she told me everything I need to know. We don't have time. I need to take action. She was a prime asset. It doesn't matter anymore. It's us or them. I'm in charge now. Give me your weapons. That's not going to happen. All we need to do is deliver Farhan to Hatchet. Once he gets what he came here for, he's gone. And I, for one, will be right behind the motherfucker. You can't just release him into the wild. That's exactly what I'm gonna do. Briggs, take her sidearm. This is mutiny. I'm sorry, Abby. You had your shot. It's called doing what it takes. Don't you touch me, you fuck. Your intercoms, hand 'em over. Fuck, Miller, seriously, you're going to bargain with a fucking psychopath? This is for your own good, okay? You'll thank me eventually. You... If all Hatchet wanted was Farhan, he would've taken him. This situation is way more - complex than you realize. - You ready? You're out of your depth. - Let's go. - Miller! Think about it! Something else is going on here. - Come on, buddy. - Miller, stop! We're off to see the wizard. You can't bargain with Hatchet! Fuck! Mom! Mom, Mom, look! Look there! Look there! It's a crab! Look, look! Look. Look, it's a crab. It's got sand on it. Can I hold it? Please? Can I hold it? Pick it up for me. Hey, baby, what are you doing over there? Audrey. I wanna get in the water. Quick, come on! - Crab, look, a crab! - Whoa! Okay. - I got you. - Can you pick it up for me? It's moving, it's moving! - Look! - Okay, okay. Come on, Mom! Hey babe, come on, let's pick up the crabs for Audrey. Do you believe Farhan? I found a document that backs up his story. It couldn't have been a lone bomber. Does anyone else know about this? No, I haven't shared it yet. I wanted to make sure it checked out. Okay. Send it to me. This could be explosive if it gets in the wrong hands. She working for Hatchet? Or whoever Hatchet's working for. Any update from Langley on my drone missile theory? Nope, nothing so far. Hatchet! It's your lucky day. I brought your guy. Look, it's a simple trade, man. No tricks. You take Farhan, we all get the fuck out of here. Abby, are you there? I think I have a solution. Half a solution. What the fuck? Hatchet! If you don't want him, I'm happy to waste him right now. We doing this? Uri? - Sorry, Abby. - Oh, fuck. What's happened to you? Raymond's gone rogue. He took Farhan.. I'll kill him. We need comms. Time's running out. I've managed to hack something together. We gotta hurry. This should work with the satellite. Nice. But you still need to wire directly to the cliff face antenna before you make the call, okay? Let's go. What did you tell 'em about me? Nothing, nothing. Good. Good. That's all I needed to know. Farhan. Oh, fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. You noticing a pattern here? He's tying up loose ends. Yeah, and I think I know why. I know I said I wanted him alive. I'm giving you the okay to shoot on sight. Fuck. Let's get to the loading dock. It's our only way out. Come on, come on. Come on, let's go, come on. Okay, I'll head for the radio antenna. Remember, wire directly to the terminals. Best. We should get a signal. What if I can't call off the strike? Everything has a price. And if I go, I'll take him down with me. I'll get to the comms. Shh. Put this on. Go on. And this. Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah. Put it on. Coming up, come on, up. When that door opens, you run as if your life depends upon it, you got that? Okay? Good luck. Hatchet down. I got him. Confirm the kill. No. Homestead this is Citadel, Watchman two calling. Do you copy? Homestead, I repeat, do you copy? Homestead. This is Citadel, Watchman two calling. Do you copy? Watchman two, this is Homestead. Clearance code, over. My security code is Juliet-Charlie-022455. The detainment facility is now secure. Please abort drone strike and confirm. Negative, Watchman two. Clearance code rejected, drone inbound. Oh, God. Homestead, I repeat, please abort drone strike and confirm. Negative Watchman two, orders unchanged. Come on! You are no, demon, are you? You're just a man. Uri. Uri? Show me your hands. Slowly. Put down the C4 and step away. - Easy... - Put it down! Easy. Nice and easy. Stop moving. Stop moving. I said stop moving. The only thing that got me through this past year was knowing that I was going to be the one to find you. That I would get all the answers to the questions that keep gnawing at me. Farhan, he was set up so that I'd bring you in here. It was a drone strike, wasn't it? The hospital bombing. My husband. My little girl. 186 people died that day because someone at the CIA ordered a drone strike. And I don't know if it was intentional, but Silas sent you in to cover it up. It was... it was a mistake to assign you to this case, Abby. Your report started the whole fucking thing. Working out it was a drone and not a bomb. You're actually a very good analyst, Abby. We clearly didn't fucking count on you uncovering this. Is that where you come in? To take me, my sources, and all the intel out? What can I say? Hey, the agency assigns you your cases, they assigned me mine. You were ordered to murder a base full of people? You're fucking out of your mind! And it's gonna end right here. Then what? Huh? You think I'm the only... the only Hatchet? Huh? There were others fucking before me, there'll be many others after. And all that evidence you're gathering, safely stored downstairs... Hey, you're old friend Tessa, she's takin' care of that right about... ...now. It's over, all right? Yeah? None of it fucking matters. So just, I'll get Silas to go along with our story, we'll be each others witness. All right, come on. You're not a killer. - We're on the same team. - Right. Let's... let's bring each other home. I've spent every hour of every day wondering what happened to them at the end, and now you're fucking gonna find out. You think you can... you think you can just walk away? Huh? There's nowhere you can run, there's nowhere you can fucking hide! They'll find you! - I'm not gonna hide. - Silas, you, me. - I'm going to find them first. - We're all the same, we followed orders! I won't die today! I won't fucking die! I am death, you hear me? Fuck. Tango Team to Langley. We've neutralized Citadel. No survivors. Copy that lieutenant. What do I file this under, sir? What do you file what under, lieutenant? Understood, sir Over and out. Now I know the truth. Who the real enemy is. Please, please. It was a mistake to assign me to this case. I'm their problem now. The real monsters are still out there. And they have no idea what's coming.
