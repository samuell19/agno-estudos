Please, Siddhu. [Siddhu screaming] Save me. Please leave me. Please, Siddhu. Please don't harm me. I beg you. I will do whatever you ask me to. Please. [Siddhu roars] Its a dummy knife. Its a dummy knife. Greetings to everyone. This is a street play. This is based on the atrocities perpetuated on women to this very day. It's for our awareness. This is an experiment designed by us and executed by Siddhu and Monica. Even it makes you uncomfortable, think about it once. This could happen to anyone among us. Silent! Sir, the DNA is matching. The footage of the CCTV at toll gate... They are the ones, sir. We have checked the footage. Sir... I have taken their statement as well, sir. Will be submitting in the court tomorrow... Sir? Sir... Thursday, sir. Okay, sir. I will take them to the spot tomorrow and recreate the scene. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. What's up? Did you guys eat anything? Feed them some biryani. Give them what they like to eat. Have it. Tell me, Miss. I am so sorry for troubling you, uncle. But it's been four months since my parents left our house. I don't know where they are... I don't know what happened to them, uncle. My father didn't go to his home town either. My mother is unwell. Bus stand, airport, railway station... we've checked the CCTV footage at all these places. We couldn't find a single clue. Didn't I already tell you this earlier? Put an Ad out in the TV or newspaper... My father-in-law is quite a popular man. If we advertise in the papers and television that he's been missing... It's going to ruin his reputation. Uncle, Sree is highly stressed. Please give it another try, uncle. If there is another way... Everyday, there are about 400 missing cases. 400 missing cases come to me. I am confident. I'll take care of it. I'll do something. Don't be tensed. SATYANAND ACTING INSTITUTE [no voice] [no voice] Bye, see you Thank you so much. See you later, Thank you. -Bye -Bye Siddhu, there is a golden member in every batch. For this batch, you are the one. Really, I am proud of you. Thank you, Master. I am very happy. A lot of people have trained with me and became superstars. I wish you to be as super successful as them and become a pan-India superstar. And I am sure you will. Millions are going to be mesmerized by your acting skills and become your fans. As an actor, you are born into every character and die a character's death. When the mother-earth experienced the never-ending struggle. Learn the language. I don't need crores of people to adore me, Master. One person. Just one person. If that person admits that I am an actor, that is enough for me. I don't need anything more than that, Master. Who is that person? I will tell you later. Thank you for everything. God bless you, Siddhu. All the best. Namaste, sir. This is Ranga Rao speaking. I am Ranga Marthanda Raghava Rao's son. Is this Parichuri Parshad's Venkateshwar Rao speaking? Namaste, sir. Did my father come to the Parshad? He didn't? Alright, sir. Thank you. He didn't go there either. Where could they have gone, Ranga? What exactly happened to them? Ranga... - Could something have happened to them? - No... no... - No way. - Oh God. - [kids]: Bye uncle! - Stop it, guys. Stop it. I have to do a play in the evening. We might end up losing our voices. - Untie the rope. - I want to pee. - Right now, Hanumanthu? - I want to pee. You might wet your sarong. Go. Hello, son... He went to Varanasi, he will return in a week. Little Lord Rama, the heavyset Ravana, and the little Lady Sita... They all look delightful, sir. Where is the venue, sir? There's a play competition at the ZP High school, Bhuvanagiri, this evening, sir. Ghani, get some water to drink. - Jai Sriram! - Lord have mercy! Who sent him here? - My sarong got wet. - Ghani! How many times do I have to tell you not to serve outside? Go inside! Lord, have mercy! Go inside and wash only the plates. I beg you. I wonder where such people come from. Have mercy! If you send the old man to serve again, I will break your legs. Brother, who is he? Some random guy. A useless fellow. He came to wash the plates. What do you need, sir? Mr. Raghava Rao? You are Ranga Marthanda Raghava Rao, aren't you? Why is someone of your stature doing this job? Sir. It's me, sir. Siddharth. I am an actor. Remember Mrs. Indrani? Sir... Sir... Just as you've suggested, I learnt Telugu, sir. Hi, Siddharth. Rahul... - Where is your father-in-law? - Father-in-law? - My in-laws went to Varanasi, sir. - Varanasi? - Did he really go to Varanasi? - Put it on speaker. Why would you ask like that? He went to Varanasi. Why do you ask? Nothing, nothing. Leave it. Bye. Hello? Hello? [TV]: Kala Bharati burnt to ashes. This Kala Bharati that housed many plays and meetings has been completely destroyed in the fire accident that took place during the dawn. Kala Bharati was inaugurated in 1983 by the then chief minister NT Rama Rao. This place was established specifically for the progress of theatre arts. A lot of artists have been born on this very stage and flourished as well. Hey wait! Sir, please come. Sir... Sir... Please sir. I won't ask you anything. I won't speak either. I am heading to Hyderabad as well. I will drop you at Kala Bharati. Please, sir. I promise on my mother's name, sir. Sir, let's go. Please get in. Please get in, sir. Come. Hello, Rahul. Your father-in-law is at Kala Bharati. - My father-in-law? - What is it? I am with him. You guys head here quickly as well. Fast! Siddhu, is my mother along with him? Siddhu? Rahul, let's go. What? To Kala Bharati? Rahul? Alright, fine. I'll be there soon. Ranga. Sir... sir... I am the one... I am the one... Ranga Marthanda Raghava Rao. Right here. Right here. Right here. Right here. So many plays... So much applause. So many accolades. Here... right here... Isn't this a game, Lord Shiva? Isn't this a play, Lord Shiva? Isn't playing acting? Isn't a play the spoken word? Is there anything better than a play and song? The most distinguished artist who breathes life into a period of time. In fact, the stage of the theatre is synonymous with Raghava Rao and Raghava Rao is synonymous with the stage of the theatre. Raghava played the role of Girisham in the play Gurujada Kanya Shulkam, Murari in the play Bhavidipati Keerthiseshlu, Gopal in the play Raktha Kaneeru. As Ravana, Suyodhana, Keechaka and the magical monk, And as Shylok in the Shakespearean play, Merchant of Venice. He donned many different roles with great brilliance. In days such as these, when even a little fame garnered on the theatre stage makes the artists migrate to small screens or the silver screens, Raghava is someone who wasn't swayed by such temptations... He said 'Theatre is my mother'. 'I would end my life on this very stage if required.' He said. His words reflect the self-respect of all the Telugu theatre artists. [lady hooting] Love you, father. On behalf of all the theatre artists, we are proud to present this outstanding artist with a golden bracelet... ...and decorate him with the laurel of 'Ranga Marthanda'. Now, our Ranga Marthanda shall say a few words to mark this occasion. I, Ranga Marthanda Raghava Rao, shall no longer act. To be or not to be. That is the question. That is what Shakespeare said. Yes or no, should I say it or not, shall I stay or leave. For a heart that asks such fresh questions, the answers it seeks must be fresh as well. When I was a child, no matter what play came to my village, I would always be seen loitering around it. After the play was done, I would pick up the trash and recite the songs of play, The great elder, SV Ranga Rao, noticed me and called me towards him. He told me that that was not where I belonged. He joined me in a theatre club in Kakinada. I worked with stalwarts such as SV Ranga Rao, Govinda Raju, Subba Rao, C.S. Rao, Gummadi and all. During the rehearsals when someone struggled with a line, I would help them. One day, an actor failed to show up. So they made me dress up for the part and pushed me onto the stage. I peed my pants because I was scared. The audience must forgive me for sharing such unsavoury detail. But... I don't know how but I managed to say the dialogue. 'Bravo!' That is what Mr. S.V. Ranga Rao said from the audience and I can still hear it. That is how my journey as a theatre artist began. And in time, the accolades, laurels, fame, etc. all came. Along with those came curses such as high blood pressure and diabetes. I am unable to stand like before. I am unable to use my voice to enhance the beauty of the song. Even though I portrayed many characters successfully and delectably, I couldn't do justice to two roles. One as a husband to my Raju. The one who bears is called a husband. Since she put up with me all these years, she is my husband. Second, my Raju gave me two adorable children. My son Ranga Rao. I named him after the stalwart Mr. Ranga Rao. The second is my daughter, my golden girl. In my career of 40 years as a theatre artist, and even in my personal life, my brother, my friend and my guide is Chakrapani. His wife is Subhadra. I want to spend time with all of them. I portrayed so many characters. I have been adored and showered with felicitations and awards. This adoration is not some charity given out of pity. This is an achievement that I have gained, working tirelessly through day and night. That's enough. This chapter is closed. The exit should be as spectacular as the celebration. The entire world is my family. It's difficult for me to leave the stage which has been my home for years. But I have no choice. What can I give all of you who have been a part of my journey of these many years? That is why... Even though my ego doesn't agree with it... May you have a long happy married life with a son and a daughter... If you are done worshipping your husband, feed me because I am hungry... Why did you do that? Why did you hit? Father! Hit him. Doctor? How is my granddaughter? How do you know that it's going to be a girl, father-in-law? What if it's a boy? Mother... my mother is going to be reborn. When Ranga Marthanda Raghava Rao says it or throws a dialogue, there's no going back on it. - Drunkard! Stop acting up. - Come this way. Come. Stand beside each other. From this day onwards, I am going to crown Mrs. Geeta Ranga Rao as the queen of this palace Hey, what are you blabbering? In my will, I bequeathed this house to my daughter-in-law. Mr. Raju. Father-in-law, why would you do that? Aren't you the boss for my son? Take it, dear. I don't want all this, father-in-law. It's not for you, dear. It's for my mother that you are carrying inside you. Raghava Rao, did you drink a lot? I'm coming to you. I'm coming to you. Listen, I earned a lot. And I wasted a lot of money too. But what my wife saved from time to time without my knowledge, in fixed deposits Shares and jewellery too. I have transferred the locker key and all of them to you. You retired there and here you've settled all your affairs. You've gone crazy, buddy. - I want to live free. - I don't want anything. Why would you give everything to us without keeping anything for yourself? What do I lack? - I have the both of you, don't I? - What about our mother? Mother? The renowned Ranga Marthanda Raghava Rao is there from head to toe. Please come, Raju. Please come. Sit down, please. Sit down, Raju. Raju, you must sit. My Raju. For having put up with me all these years and for letting me live like myself, this is yours. If you are not here, I do not exist. Sister, looks like he's starting on a new play. Be careful. Stop it, husband. That man is a king. My sister-in-law is very lucky. Why don't you learn something from watching them? What? You want me to learn from him? We don't have wealth to give out and neither do we have children to share wealth to. What? Have you started crying already? What's that nonsense you spout? Aren't my children your children? If you need children, I have a lot of time to spare now. You can adopt me. - What? You want me to adopt you? - Yes. Does anyone adopt a ten-headed Ravana? - Rather, it would be better to die. - If that's the case, go ahead and die. First, you die and then I will. No, first you die and then I'll follow you. Woman, I am hungry. Please serve me food. Father-in-law seems to be rude and crude on the outside. But on the inside, he is a nice man. Yeah, yeah. Since he's bequeathed this house to you. Very... - Are you J? - Should I be? Well, father-in-law knows who is efficient. Hey! Hello. Sorry. Anyway. Remember my cousin Bobby? The one who is in real estate? When he came to our house, he said, 'Wow, what a property! ' He was surprised that the house sat on so much land at the heart of the city. Cool! He said that he would convert them into 9 +1 apartments. He would get four floors and we would get 5 floors. We will stay in the top floor apartment and your parents can stay in the opposite flat to ours. Ten crores worth. Isn't it awesome? You mean separately? Yeah, why not? We can all live freely, independently and happily. You mean you want to tear this house down? I don't think... My father wouldn't agree to this. - I don't like it at all. - You mean wearing this vest? Ms. Raju. Whether it's today or tomorrow, it's going to be theirs anyway. We just gave them their inheritance a little early. That's all. If everything is going to belong to them after us, what's the need to do this right now? That's exactly it. Did you see how pleased your daughter-in-law was? Would we be able to see that after we're dead? It's wrong to give it all away without keeping something for ourselves, husband. What do we do now? And you have suddenly stopped acting as well. Why worry, Raju? We have such dutiful children. They will take care of us. Even if they are our children, it would be wise to keep something for ourselves. You have such great faith on that small little tablet. How is it that you don't have enough faith on the very children that you raised from their infancy? Money is evil. Fine, we will deal with it later. I will still be alive then. What is it? Wife, getting our daughter married would help us fulfil all our responsibilities but the thought of sending her away is filling me with despair. What are you going to do instead of sending her away? Are we going to keep her here with us? She is one tom boy. I wonder what songs she listens to and the pubs she frequents and the bands she is in... I don't understand anything about her. Fusion music. The music of the future. The artist is always a generation ahead. [singing] [singing] Devi! No matter how many hardships the pilgrimage to Varanasi encompassed. I still visited it. A pilgrimage to Varanasi is the blessing that the pilgrim earned. - [play practice going on] - Hey Ranga! - [play practice going on] - Ranga! - [play practice going on] - Hey! - [play practice going on] - Hey! - [play practice going on] - Ranga! Ladies and Gentlemen, the denizens of Varanasi, the truly fortunate ones, This is my wife Chandramati. I am Harishchandra. - Hey qualities are such... - Are such... - Every word of hers... - Dad, It's not that. - Every word. - Dad, Did your wife say something? She doesn't know... - Say the dialogue properly. - I worked on this all night, father. I worked on this all night, father. We slept in the morning. Since it's US timings... - Please... - You need to sing slowly. She is pregnant, father. What? You want us to leave? Sorry, father. - Mother? - There he comes: your golden son. Is the breakfast ready? Two minutes, son. There's bread there. Why don't you come and make your own breakfast? Give it here! Give it! Just give it! Father! Mother-in-law? So much chilli? Such high amounts of chilli leads to indigestion, acidity, ulcers and finally, even gastric cancers. You say chilli leads to death. Isn't there medication to get around it? Medication during meals to make sure one doesn't eat. Shut up, Sree. From now on, all these salts, chilli and masalas are not to be used in the dishes. - Without salt and chilli? - From now on, please relax, mother-in-law. I will take care of it. To make sure the people in our household stay healthy, I've planned a special diet. In conclusion, she is driving you out of the kitchen, mother. The life is better if the diet is good. Anne, the dietician, is going to be coming here everyday to make sure our health is all good. This is for father-in-law. Oh no! Your father-in-law doesn't like food if it's not seasoned properly with salt and chilli. I mean... You want to bring the house down and build an apartment complex? What after that? I mean... Geeta's cousin... Well, what we thought was... Just come straight to the point. Don't scare him. I want to know what his wife told him... Just keep quiet. I'll ask him. What is it? What's going on? Geeta's cousin is in real estate. They are planning to break this entire house down. That is it. Your son is always scared to bring up anything with you, father-in-law. What we were thinking is... Apartment complexes have sprung up all around us. And our house is the only odd one out. There's no investment... Just the land is enough. 60:40 share. We could profit up to 10 crores. Money. Is that what you're after? What about sentiments and a feeling that this is ours? Where will you get those from? - That is not what this is, father-in-law. - Listen, dear. I earned my own money and laid each brick upon one another with so much love and care and I built this house with a lot of affection. Your husband was born here. And his sister was born here too. Tomorrow, your daughter i.e. my mother, is going to be born here as well. We must get our daughter married here as well. - I mean... - We have been here for the past forty years, dear. We want to stay here for the remainder of our lives. After we are dead, you can do what you want with it. Why bring that up? Until then, please excuse this house, Smt. Geeta Ranga Rao. Please. Raju, I am hungry. Where's the breakfast? What is that? From today onwards, this is going to be cooked in our house, father. Please bring something that humans can eat, Raju. Listen, even if you bring all the heavenly flavors of the food and serve me... Idiot, why are you harassing me this way? Just hold on, I'll do it. You keep annoying me. I am driving. Sree! I will meet you in the evening for tea. - Raghava? - Come. - Raghava? - What is it? This guy is Rahul. He finished his MBA in computers. He earns one lakh per month. He has wealth and he has rental properties that make him a monthly income as well. Well, in the YouTube... what was that? Music videos, sir. - Explain it to him. - I make music videos, sir. - Party songs, devotional songs, popular songs... transgender... - Transgender? That song Transgender is quite a famous song, sir. A lot of parties play that song. The video has 10 million views. And the choreography of that song is quite popular. "Hey, buddy, what is going on? My name is Transgender." Just move out of my way. Or else I will make music from your... Hold on... Hold on... What do you want me to do about it? Idiot! He is a potential groom for our daughter. Uncle, this is my father-in-law? Uncle, you have messed it all up. Who? You mean this guy? She looks like pure gold. And this one looks like black gold. - I don't agree to this. - How can you say that, father-in-law? Look at how fair my mother-in-law is. And look at how dark-skinned you are. Even so, didn't your wife agree to be married to you? Do you think the both of us are of the same colour? Why take colour so seriously, father-in-law? You look like Gulab Jamun And I look like Kala Jamun. The only difference is in the taste. - First, stop calling me your father-in-law. - Okay, father-in-law. Why are you going overboard, Raghava Rao? I like this man. I am asking you respectfully. Get me married to him. Couldn't you agree to it, father-in-law? What if I don't get you guys married? He will marry me. Father, please. Please, mother. It's not possible to always be the way you are. Don't be adamant that your word must always prevail. Make sure that both of you are in the same page. From today onwards, your mother and father is going to be Rahul. I am giving my gold. I know that you will take good care of her. But if something goes wrong, remember that I played many roles of a demon king. Remember that. You said she is your gold. The value of gold doesn't diminish just because its relocated. Gold is going to remain the same no matter where it is. Salim! Take those chairs and arrange them... Why don't you do it? Why does it feel so strange? We are blessed with daughters. They grow up beautiful and very-well raised. And suddenly they leave. I never thought that my golden girl would leave. After she got married and left, everything feels so empty. You are quite lucky, buddy. You don't have such kind of pain. There's no way I would be in pain over people leaving me. I don't have children. I am quite lucky. Buddy, I didn't have you in mind when I said that. Stop it. Idiot! There's a saying that a person cried that he didn't have footwear, to a person who had no legs. That's someone like you. Why can't you pretend that everything is fine? What do you want me to do? No matter what I do, you complain that I am over reacting and end up feeling jealous. Do you doubt that? You are a horrible actor. Alright, fine. You are born alone and you die alone. And everything in between is pretend. It's a play that involves the entire world. Do you remember that dialogue? Cheers. You are born alone and you die alone. And everything in between is pretend. It's a play that involves the entire world. Mr. Palagummi Padma Raju. The role that I thought I would carry until the end of my life is suddenly cut off. When I was confused and didn't know what to do, life wrote another play for me to star in. It brought in a new character of grand daughter and gave me the role of a grandfather. Husband, father and grandfather. The past, the present and the future. In the play of life, every man is an actor. That is how I began to play the role of a grandfather. Am I playing that role or am I living that role? Or am I living through it by pretending? Didn't I tell you that it's going to be a girl? Alright, fine, father-in-law. That's great. Dear, when I say a dialogue or predict something, it's going to happen for sure. Listen. Your name is going to be Veera Venkata Satya Shiva Sundaravalli Devasena Chamundeshwari. That's your name. Such a long name, father-in-law? Just calling her is going to take fifteen minutes. It's alright, dear. It's alright, dear. Take a picture. No... no... No photos, please. Father-in-law, please. That's a newborn baby, father-in-law. No photos. That rule applies for other kids. It's not meant for Ranga Marthanda's granddaughter. Smile, smile. My mother, right? You are my mother, aren't you? (Song) - Phone, phone. - Give me the phone, dear. - Hello. - Sorry, what happened to that aunty? What happened? Last night, while she was serving food, she suddenly fell unconscious. She couldn't breathe. - I immediately got her here. - What did the doctor say? High blood pressure and haemorrhage. They say that the situation is quite critical. Don't you worry? Did you eat anything? Raju will take care of her. Come with me. Let's come. Come now. She is a fool. When we couldn't have kids, my mother would goad her and call her a barren woman. Even then, she never said a single word. She went to temples, saints, gurus for children. She would go to the doctors and get all sorts of tests done. In the end, when we found out that I am the one at fault, she never said a single word. I would participate in plays until midnight, spend time in the company of other women, get drunk and then ring the doorbell. She would keep waiting for me until then. We are disgusting. The were intoxicated by the arrogance of our youth. The affairs we had were more than the awards that we won. And now, we preach morals and values like we were good men all along. They are truly innocent. What can we do to cleanse ourselves of these sins? Raghava, I am scared. Don't worry. Nothing is going to happen. Raghava, please do something and make sure she stays alive. I swear, Raghava. I swear on theatre. Chakri. I will take really good care of her. For the rest of my life, I will take very good care of her. Raghava. - Nothing is going to happen. - Please, buddy. Bye, auto uncle. Where did you go without informing us? Do you know how worried I was? What is this, father-in-law? Is it right to take a child to the hospital? That place is full of diseases. What if she caught some infection? Nothing like that... Aunt Subbu is not well. We had to go to the hospital immediately. Since there was no one at home, we had to take the child with us. You could have given us a call, mother-in-law. Either your son or I would have come to pick her up. That's not it, mother. Since there's dengue and malaria circulating in the city... She got really worried. - You go inside... - Come, I will bathe you with Dettol. If you are taking your grand daughter somewhere, please inform us once, father-in-law. Please don't misunderstand me. Come. Well, mother... She is... Ranga. My feet are burning, sir. Its too hot. Stand like that. Never repeat it. Children, local language cannot be spoken here. Only English. Understand? - If you speak Telugu... - Karuna... - You will also be punished like this. - Grandpa! - Be careful! - What is it, dear? Hello? She's my granddaughter. Why are you standing without your shoes on, my dear? Come here. - Security! - Grandpa... I was reciting the poem 'Vinadagu Nevvaru Cheppina' to my friends. The principal heard me and scolded me. He punished me by ordering me to stand in the sun without my shoes on. What the hell is this? - What's this unjust treatment? - She's speaking some non-sense. Is speaking in Telugu wrong? Do you look down upon your mother tongue? A language is a melange of history, culture and heritage. People from Japan, Germany, Russia and France educate themselves in their mother tongue and are experts in different fields. They aren't taking shelter under the umbrella of English and burning their essence. Hello?! This is an American Consulate affiliated American International School. You know that? English is must here. So what?! That doesn't mean other languages are cheaper. First, understand the meaning of a language. It is unique to our species because it helps us express our unique thoughts and ideas and different cultures of the society. Language preserves culture. This place places much more importance of the language that enslaved us rather than our own mother-tongue. You don't need to be educated here. Hello, that's your loss. Father-in-law, they said that they would allow her to transfer to another school because they don't want her. Tell them to go ahead. Is there only one school around? There are many schools around. Another school? Impossible. Do you think that is some no-consequence school that educates its children in Telugu medium? We got our MP to call the British Council director to recommend us. And we got her a seat after paying lakhs of rupees. English is a universal language, father-in-law. Does it say anywhere that one must not learn Telugu? What will she do by learning Telugu? Is she going to recite prayers in the temple? Dear, the prayers are in Sanskrit. Telugu is our mother tongue. I don't think you understand, father-in-law. In the future, if she wants to do a global job, or get married to a guy from the US... English is a must. I am not denying that. But forgetting our mother-tongue is equivalent to forgetting our mother. Father-in-law, please. Please stop pushing this agenda. It seems like you are stuck in some stone age. Can't you at least let us take care of our daughter's education? Oily stuff. Ranga, bring her inside. The Italian of the east as praised by the English would be killed, crushed, buried by itself. Hail English! Have taken upon arms. Having taken to arms, The heads of enemies have rolled. The heads of the enemies roll. You are a big tiger... a big tiger... you are a big tiger... Father-in-law! Father. Hi, Raghava Rao. Mother. - Namaste. - Black gold, how are you? - Hi, Salim Bhai. - I'll give it. Is he taking good care of you? Super dad, He is a really good guy. If someone gets angry that would be me. He has to do what I ask. This is my kingdom. - Rahul... what a pity. - That's wrong. Just because he is a nice fellow, don't take him for granted. Nothing like that. This is how it should be. If not, men just go wild. Everything here is under my control. I wonder what's going on. Here, take it. In our house, your father and your sister-in-law are unable to get along with each other. Everyday they end up fighting. - She doesn't listen. - And he doesn't agree. And your brother is the one who ends up suffering in between. Serves him right for being a coward. Your daughter-in-law is arrogant. She is quite opportunistic and uses people for personal gain. That's 'cause she works in the corporate. Don't try to stop father. Let him give it back to her. That will keep her in check. Why doesn't something like that happen to me? - My black gold enjoys it a lot. - Why would you speak like that? Black gold... black gold... black gold... - I will kick you. - He is my husband. Black gold, why is there not a single complaint against you? I am waiting for it. - You sit down too, mother. - I am just like you, father-in-law. What do you mean? My wife is my ball and chain. Hey! Look at him say that. I feel a little uncomfortable heading back to our home. A house or even our daughter, once it's given away, it's not ours The children have grown. They have developed their own likings and ideologies. Should we really continue staying there? Our daughter-in-law doesn't like us. A long while back, you bought 2 acres of land in the village. Let's go there, husband. Please listen to me once, husband. Raju, what is this? Is there any family that exists without small little issues such as these? But does that mean we should leave them and go? If we don't stay with our children and teach them what's good and what's bad, who is going to teach them? Our daughter-in-law is a bit stubborn like me. But her heart is in the right place. Everyone is different, aren't they? I get it. From now on, I will not trouble her. I will obey my wife's command. How can you stay so cheerful husband? Don't worry. - I am so happy that you are here. - I am the princess you're looking for. - She is just Cinderella. - Yes, she is our servant. I am the Cinderella that you are looking for. Yes, I was just looking for you. Fantastic! Flabbergasting! What a lovely performance of a western classic! Cinderella. Give them a big hand. As you know, St. Anne stands for good quality and higher standards. Thank you. Thank you. Children, take your places. When is my granddaughter's performance? It's after this. It's going to be really good. It's an amazing show. And now, as per some local request and demand, I am presenting a 'Tellugu' song. Enjoy. (Song) Hey! Stop it! Shut up! Are these the high standards that you were talking about? They are children. I am unable to watch this nonsense on television. And now you've started this here as well? Is this what you think of Telugu culture? Hey, Tellugu... It's not 'Tellugu'...It's Telugu. Just pronounce it properly. Telugu. Whatever! Security! Sir, please, sir. Are you even parents? Just get lost! Sir... sir... Aren't you ashamed of yourself? They are tomorrow's generation. Is this what we are teaching them? Is this the reason why we spend lakhs of rupees on their tuition fees? How are you able to see this? How are you able to sit through this? And how can you applaud this? Father, please. Has the educational system fallen this down from grace? Let's go, dear. This is not at all acceptable. Come tomorrow and take the transfer certificate for your child. Parents, I am so sorry. Please. I apologize. Come. I am not coming. It's time for you to have your juice. Come. - I want to stay with grandpa. - Just shut your mouth and come. I will drink my juice with grandma. I'll give you a slap if you don't listen to me. - I will hit you ten times. - Geeta! Have you any sense? If you are angry with me, talk to me. My daughter and it's my wish. Why are you interfering? Geeta, shut up! Watch your tongue. I won't shut up. Are you going to hit me? Why are you over reacting? Why are you guys fighting? Let's go inside and talk this through. Listen, if I made a mistake, please forgive me. You are not at fault, father-in-law. I married your son and stayed in this house. I am the one at fault. That's enough. You are going overboard. You are a coward who doesn't speak. And when I speak, you are trying to shut me up. - That's enough now. - Ranga! Hold on. Let her speak. Tell me. Just say everything that you are stopping yourself from saying. We have a lot of problems with you father-in-law. We can't do anything, we can't say anything... And everything in the house has to go according to your wishes. We have absolutely no freedom. You turn everything into a fight. Your words are so cheap! When we brought up the topic of apartments, you talked about sentiments. When I recommend healthy food, you crack jokes about serving you human food. When we are sleep, you sing poems loudly and shout about. When I want to invite friends or colleagues home, I am scared that you might say something to them. The world is moving really fast. Very competitive. We are unable to live like you. Please don't interfere in our lives any longer. Please. (Song) When you asked her to forgive you and begged her forgiveness, I didn't like it at all. Father... I need to speak to grandpa once. Please. Father, I couldn't sleep the whole night. Geeta is very disturbed as well. She feels very guilty. Seriously, I am very sorry, father-in-law. I couldn't keep it in. Perhaps it would have been better if the put it a bit more delicately rather than being harsh about it. It's alright, dear. You said exactly what was in your heart. Father, I am very scared of you. Right from my childhood. I don't know why but... even standing in front of you... Just say what you want to say clearly. Father, you both are uncomfortable here and so are we... That is why we thought it would be better if we could live separately for a while. We are anyways giving the land for development. The construction will be over in 6 months as well. Until then, we will stay in Geeta's mother's place. We think it would be better if you stay with Sree. It's only for 6 months, father-in-law. I know that you like Sree a lot. Your son will talk to Rahul. How can we stay in our son-in-law's place? It would be odd. Raju, they are not asking for permission. They are asking us to leave from their house. - That's not what I mean, father. - That's not what I meant. I know exactly what you meant, my son. Life is a sad play to be lived happily. You play your part, I'll play mine. That's all. Thank you. Father, that's not what I... Let's go, Raju. This chapter is over. (Song) What's going on? Have you started a new play? Looks like you are headed somewhere. And without telling me as well. Shut up! You wanted to show off and retired from performing. You gave your wealth away. Since you gave it all away, why couldn't you just stay silent in one corner? You didn't let go of your arrogance. Lady, you know about his personality, don't you? He is always up to some nonsense or another. And you keep following him like this is the walking competition in the Olympics? If your son doesn't want you around, don't you have your daughter? Do you think he has a daughter? As soon as the daughter is married, she is as good as dead. - Your daughter is as good as dead... - My dear girl. Don't call me that. Call black gold. If you say another word, I'm going to hit you, Raghava Rao. That's not what this is. We didn't want to trouble our son-in-law. The great leader Nagamma is here to sever the bonds. You have distanced yourself from me. Aren't sons and daughters equal? I am like your son, father-in-law. Come to our house. I will take care of it. How many more people should try to convince you? Come, start. Swear on me that you will come with me now. Money. Just as Mr. Mullapudi said, 'Man is infected by the disease called money.' It's like the termite infestation on a young, healthy tree. And just like the termite infestation, money is eating the world away. Mother, father, son, daughter, mother-in-law, daughter-in-law, grandfather, grandson, teacher, friend... Everyone. It eats everyone up. After the chapter with my son ended, the chapter at my daughter's house began. Just because the location changes, does the game change? Whether it's Mahabharat or a man's life, it's pool of sorrows. Tripuraneni Gopichand. Happiness. It's the pit stop between two tragedies. - Ranga? - Huh? Uncle? What brings you here? Suddenly, I felt like seeing you. - Are you guys well? - We are fine, uncle. - Since we've retired from acting, it's boring as well. - Uncle, let's go out... When we did theatre, we would wear make-up and wigs to act. But you guys are doing a fine job of acting in real life, even more than us, without any need for make up or wigs. Not just you. People across the entire world are acting out and living out their lives. That idiotic fellow is an old-fashioned person. That is why he doesn't understand this. But I do understand one thing. I am the lucky guy who doesn't have children. Isn't that so? I forgot to tell you. You are getting a ten-storied building made, aren't you? I warn you not to put it in your children's name. In the future, if they catch you by your throat and shove you out... You will end up feeling sad. You will feel sad. Father-in-law. I asked you for a good folk song to sing at the coke studio. Please, father-in-law. It should be awesome. - Amid the bushy field embankments. - Amid the bushy field embankments? - "Amid the bushy field embankments" -When the moon rises. The moon keeps piercing. "Amid the bushy field embankments" "Colors colors in the sky! Colors colors in the sky!" "When the moon rises" "Colors colors in the sky! Colors colors in the sky!" (Song) - It's really nice. - Good, good. It will become a popular hit. Last night, it garnered 25 million views. This time, it will touch 30 million views for sure. This is the Telangana folksong fusion. Well done, son-in-law. Ma'am! Ma'am! Look at sir! - You... - [Raju garu gasping] You are Ranga Marthanda Raghava Rao, aren't you? - Namaste, sir. - Namaste. - Are you acquainted with him? - The entire world knows him. He is a wonderful actor. What movies did he act in? Not movies. The theatre comes alive once he walks onto the stage. We would go crazy over the poems recited by the Duryodana character he played. - Why didn't he do any movies? - I don't get along well with movies, lady. They are just an illusion. When we say a dialogue, we are advised to say it in bits and pieces. And that's something I cannot do. Once I get onto the stage and start the dialogue, it must continue until the very end. - Outdated, huh? - Why would you use that word? Who are you calling outdated? Even before movies came, theatre existed. The thing that sustained the movies is the theatre. Father! Father! - They came to produce our music videos. - Yes, father-in-law. They are biggies in the field. Alright. We are introducing our son as the hero and are producing the film. Does he have any experience in acting? He learned acting in London theatre of Arts. He trained at the New York Academy as well, sir. We are making a pan-India movie with 150 crores budget. - We need the blessings of great men like you, sir. - I wish him all the success. - Next time when he comes, I will bring him to you. - Please do. - Rahul, we shall take our leave. - Yes, ma'am. I will speak to Devi. Whether it's the original or this song, you are the one who is going to be singing. - Okay, ma'am. - You have a beautiful voice. - Thank you, ma'am. - I am going to give you a fantastic and first break in cinema. - Thank you so much, ma'am. - Good luck. Thank you. - We shall take our leave, sir. - Very well. Did you take a bath? What is this, Raghava Rao? You are without clothes, and you've oiled your entire body. You look like you are someone in a village fair. Why did you come like that? Isn't it nice? Father. Close. This is not our house, is it? What if Rahul misunderstands? Hello, stop that. This is our house as well. Father-in-law, I am sorry. You can live as you wish. Shut up, Rahul. They are our producers. - How is it right to be that rude? - She was the one who started it first. Didn't you see that? - Father-in-law, you gave a really smart reply. - Don't be stupid. They are paying us and they said they would give us an opportunity in the movies as well. Neither money nor chance... no one is giving us any charity. Actually, they are using our talent for their business. - And they pay us very little. - Don't be so arrogant, Rahul. Don't become like my father. The field that we are in needs a bit of diplomacy. If not, tomorrow... Why are you guys fighting? From now on, I will be careful. Sorry, father. Thank you. So sweet. Did you have your breakfast? Not yet, dear. I'll get it ready. Tiktok, get the breakfast ready. Call my mother as well. What is it with you? Hey, what happened? Today is my father's birthday. Yesterday, ever since the demolition of the house, I keep missing him. Since this morning, I wanted to call him but I didn't find enough courage in me. Maybe we made a mistake in allowing them to leave, instead of stopping them. No, no. Nothing like that. Well, I don't understand your father's stubbornness. If we develop the property in a prime area, we will have a bigger house. We did this so that all of us will be happy. That's what we intended. Is that so big a crime? If you stay upset like this, it feels as if I am an outsider who came in and broke the family up. I feel very... I'll get you some coffee. (Song) Hello? Chakri? Why am I unable to cry? How well she looked after me? Such a great woman. She died. She is burning. I should be crying, shouldn't I? When we were performing such scenes on the stage, we would wail about and cry. We would make the audience cry. Rajamaundry, Kakinada, Vishakapatnam, Tenali... Didn't we give magical performances there? Well, what happened now? Why aren't my eyes shedding any tears? - Chakri, that's enough. - Why can't I cry? Enough, buddy. I am an evil man. - I am an unfortunate man. - That's enough. Come. Let's start. Let's go home. - Come. - She'd always wait for me to come home. Poor thing. At least now, until her soul's final liberation, I will wait for her. What will I do going home? It's just empty walls. Empty plate. Ceiling fan. And there's no Subbu. The thought of being alone... Being alone... I won't be able to stay alone, Raghava. I cannot. Subbu? Subbu? I am wrong, Subbu. I am wrong, Subbu. I made a mistake, buddy. Raghava, please don't leave me and go. Don't leave me. Don't leave me. I cannot stay alone. I beg you. I made a mistake, Subbu. I made a mistake. Young brother, Namaste? Hail the goddess! Right, brother. I shall take my leave. Bye, brother. Let's go. That's enough. You've been drinking since this morning. If you get ready, we can head downstairs. Raju, I am worried about what will happen to Chakri. He is unable to take in the fact that Subbu is no longer in this world. He isn't strong as he appears to be. He is a coward. During such times, I need to be beside him. And I want to get him home but I am here. What can we do? If you get ready, we can just head down and come back. Sree already asked about us twice. Get the clothes ready. - What is this suit, Raju? - Your son-in-law brought this for you. It would be wrong if you don't wear it. Even though I retired from acting, these costumes are not leaving me. Lord Shiva. Namaste, sir. Sir, didn't I tell you? This is my son. He studied in London. He is an actor. - Greet him. - Hello, uncle. Bow down and touch his feet. He is a great man. Come on, dad. Hello, uncle. What's up? I heard that you are a theatre artist. I didn't know theatre existed in India. Father-in-law, father-in-law... Bro, bro. I'm sorry. I'll see you again. Mother, come. Sorry, we will be right back. Why would you behave like that with a great man? - He is just a theatre artist. - Just a theatre artist? Chill, Chill. Friends, this is my father-in-law. Ranga Marthanda Raghava Rao. Give him a big applause, guys. Give him a big applause, guys. The song Podala podala gatla naduma has become a huge hit. Didn't we do that song? Cheers, guys. q The next song that we are going to do is going to be by him as well. It's an awesome song. Damidi Chamanti. We are the producers for that song as well. Today, my father-in-law is going to be singing it here. For all of us. Father-in-law, please. Please, father-in-law. (Song) [Raghava Rao snoring] [flight passing] [Raghava Rao groaning] My head is aching. What time is it? Raju, could you please get me some coffee? Did I drink a lot? What happened? No matter how many times this happens, you never change. We came out of our son's house. Now we are forced to stay in our son-in-law's house. If you keep repeating the same behavior here as well, how is that going to work? - No matter how good our son-in-law is... - I made a mistake, Raju. Please forgive me. I will go and apologize to our son-in-law. I am unable to see you being cheapened this way in front of the world. Why are you doing this to yourself? You are so stupid. People who are greater than you are have been reduced to begging on the streets because of their ego, arrogance and carelessness. You want to be like that? Can't you see that? My dear daughter... I am the one who is at fault. What did he do? Since I was a bit drunk, and there was music and dance, it all turned into a mess. I am the one at fault. Sorry, Rahul. Why are you apologizing, father-in-law? This is not about your apologies. Come here. I am not counselling you as such. But in today's world, it's better to be a little fake. I don't want it. the coffee. - Some coffee please. - Without sugar. If you can't control yourself when you are drunk, why would you drink? Shouldn't you take your age into consideration? What do you mean worry about age? Once people drink, the hormones rise up. And once they do, please get excited and hyper. If you don't sing and dance once you get drunk, where's the fun in that? Nonsense! Because of the mess you made last night, I don't know what Mr. Kanakam is thinking or feeling or even how he's going to react. Just thinking about you missing the opportunity to work with Devi Sri Prasad is giving me high blood pressure. Why are you getting worked up? Mr. Kanakam called me a while ago. They all really enjoyed well. They called your father an 'amazing old man'. Siddharth asked me to bring him to the shoot as well. You are the only one who is getting worked up. Have some Idly. You will cool down. Father-in-law, once you get ready, we will go to the shoot. Mother earth's grace gives you life, her anger gives you doom. Oh my god! What loud... loud! - Mom! - What is it, son? This guy is going to screw our movie. Director, please be mindful. This guy is going to screw our movie. Listen... Do you even understand? Movies are becoming global and we are making a pan-Indian movie. - Got it? - Yeah, yeah. Today's farmer will come in a helicopter. He would fly stylishly and come from the top. Okay? And spray the fertilizer. Okay? I mean... Don't think of the budget. You want money, you take it. This is my first movie. I don't want you to screw it. I don't want to do this. Change the ******** scene. Indian director. Son, relax. Relax. What is this? What's up? Regular Telugu cinema shit! Why is it that in India when it comes to acting, people are expected to wage something similar to a war? Why? You know... they feel like a war. They feel like a war. I heard that even theatre artists like you shout the dialogues instead of saying them. Why, sir? Why? We could very well speak the dialogues instead of shouting them. But even the audience further from the stage should be able to hear them, isn't it? They should hear the actor, shouldn't they? That is the reason why we exaggerate our expressions, increase the volume of our voice... But... isn't that loud? Don't dismiss that as being loud. See, emotions... When we are expressing those intense emotions, even language and every region has ups and downs. We need to catch the pulse of the emotions. What pulse? What shit is that? You know Shakespeare. Shakespeare, sir... Do you know who Shakespeare is? He is the world's greatest playwright. His method of expression is so subtle, so classy. We have to be like him, sir. We have to upgrade ourselves. To be or not to be. That is the question. Whether it's nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of the outrageous fortune ...or to take arms against the sea of troubles and by opposing, end them. To die... to sleep. No more. And by sleep to say we end. That is Shakespeare. Which play? - King Lear. - Hamlet. Act III, Scene One. Did you see that? Did you? You are the one who admitted right now that Shakespeare is the greatest. Do you know about Monk Bharata who existed centuries before Shakespeare? What about Utbhata? Kumara Gupthudu? Kalidasu? Did you even hear their names? It's become a habit to praise and champion other people's causes and culture without knowing our own. The beautiful smiley faced man. The one whose anger is frightening. The one who is peaceful but capable of immense destruction. All these make up the dance of nine emotions. The importance of portraying these emotions was very well elaborated a long time ago. Be it Shakespeare of Kalidasu, they are the ones who played with these nine emotions by evoking them or portraying them. What was the dialogue? If Mother earth agrees, she blesses with life. If she is displeased, it's death. He summarized the life of a farmer in two lines. Come on, say the dialogue once. - Why does he have to answer to you? - Say it. - Do you even know what you're saying? - You please keep quiet. Say it! When the earth wears down... It's mother earth! If you change the stresses on the syllables, it changes the meaning of the words. Don't use the words dryly. See the juicy meaning behind the words. Don't mispronounce words and think that it's trendy. Learn the language. As an actor, in every role you undertake, you are born into it and die in it. When you experience this constant clash, the actor in you comes out even without your permission. Teach your son some manners. It's not all about money. He will become a good actor only when he has a good personality. Disgusting! I will stay outside. How dare he does this?! This is not good, I'm saying. It's not good. Pack up. That's not it, my child. When he was insulting Indian actors by saying that we are loud and shout our dialogues out, how can I stay quiet? By then he had already provoked your father. Over acting. It's acting that's bought with money. Of course, he's going to be arrogant. You think you are some Micheal Jackson. Rahul, let me handle this my way. Aren't we your daughter and son-in-law? This is our future. Why is it that you don't understand such an important issue? That is why we are saying that we will leave from here, dear. You cannot get along with him. Raju is right. You can live happily without any discomfort. Why do you keep saying that you will head back to your village? Who is going to look after you at this age of yours? And I would end up worrying about how you are. What do you have in that village? Even people live there, dear. The people are much purer in the village rather than in the city. Father, you leaving is not the solution. You stay here. Tomorrow, those people are going to frequent our house for meetings regarding music. When they come in and you stay, it's going to be uncomfortable for both of you. I have a solution to make sure we don't have any problems. Please don't misunderstand me. Could you shift to the cellar room? Cellar? - This is too much, Sree. - What's wrong? Didn't we compose music in that room? There's a bed room and an attached bathroom. They'll also have their privacy. Don't be mean, Sree. Tiktok stays there, doesn't it? I will send Tiktok to outhouse. Please don't butt in, Rahul. Father, isn't this right? This way we can all stay together. And if you need something we will stay upstairs. Isn't this right? Isn't it? Isn't this correct? You are right, dear. Raju, if my child says something, she surely put in a lot of thought into it. Let's stop this from going any further. Let's go, Raju. (Song) Father, if you press 22 it connects to kitchen. If you press 24, it connects to the hall. And 26 is my bed room. No matter what it is, call me immediately. I don't like this either, father. But there's no other way. - Please try and understand. - It's alright, my dear. We will stay happily here. Shall I send for some coffee? Not right now. You can go. I love you, ma. Raju. Raju. You need to take your medicine. Your daughter has stowed us in the cellar like some old furniture. What a great daughter! It's quite alright, isn't it? She is our daughter. Perhaps, I was the one at fault. - What's wrong? - 'What's wrong', you ask? Why should we stay in a place that's not ours? Let's go back to our village. You can take care of me there, can't you? How can we leave all of a sudden, Raju? Koti is taking care of our farm. His daughter is going to be married in a month. If we go now, what's going to happen to him? Listen, you are unwell too. We have access to the hospitals here. What do you have back in the village? Our daughter is right, isn't she? If we go there, I will feel better. Let's not stay here. I am suffocating here. Take me there. I beg you. I shall obey you, Raju. This soldier of yours will execute your command. Writing a play? If Chakri was here, he would have whistled at this dialogue. Well, what happened to Chakri? Its been so many days since I saw him. After Subbu passed away... His phone is switched off. Chakri? Chakri? Chakri? Hey! Who the hell are you? It's me. Raghava. Raghava? There's no one called Raghava here. Go away. - Chakri... - Go away! You are a horrible actor. And as a human being, you are even worse. Such a piece of garbage! That is the reason why even your son threw you out. Since I am such a weirdo, I was there for you in your happiness and your troubles. I treated you as my very own brother. But you... When I was in mourning, you discarded me like a piece of cloth! You didn't even bother to find out whether I was alive or dead. Please forgive me, Chakri. I forgot about you while I was drowned in my own sorrows. Living in this colorless world is not as easy as acting with painted faces on the stage. - Raghava... - Please forgive me. I am scared, Raghava. I am unable to stay alone at home. I want to work but what skill do I have? I want to die. But I don't know how to kill myself. Buddy, did I hit you hard? Of course, not. I was just angry... ...I couldn't control myself in anger. Anger... Chakri? All the reports seem normal. It must be an age factor. And he is depressed. On the outside, he might look fine outside. But its eating him inside. His body and his mind need some rest. You can do this. Let him stay here for a week. And we can observe him. Don't worry. Nothing will happen. Thank you, doctor. What is Dhanavantri saying? Is he asking us to get some unknown tests? Hospitals are surviving because of us. He said that you don't need any tests. He said that you might not survive the night. Naughty fellow! You were acting, huh? That really scared me and almost made my heart stop for a minute. He said that you are an old fox! He advised that it would be better if you don't think of anything and stay peaceful. Buddy, was that what he suggested or is it yours? That's from me. Come, eat. Delicious. Your wife's mango pickle with fenugreek is absolutely delicious. Isn't that the reason why we would carry it around to Ambajupeta or even US whenever we had to perform farther away from home? Buddy, is there anyone in the world that would top their burgers and pizzas with mango pickle? Well, Raghava. Now that you mentioned US, I keep remembering this. Isn't that where we played... ...the Karna Suyodhana Mythri Prasthanam for the first time? Well remembered. The great writer Kondaveeti Venkata Kavi had penned. The great NTR got it penned for his film 'Dana Veera Shura Karna' But had to remove it because it ran lengthy. We were lucky and ended up with that script in our hands. Duryodhana came to meet his dear friend Karna during the Kurukshetra battle. What a great thought. Isn't that such a good scene? When we were in the US., you played the role of Karna on the stage and I played Duryodana. Didn't the entire auditorium erupt in applause over every dialogue? Such an onslaught of applause. Non-stop clapping. Such an applause. You are the actual Ranga Marthanda. It's you. The era has bestowed that laurel upon me and kicked you aside. That's all. Buddy, be it life or in the theatre, you have always been beside me. You caught me many times to make sure that I don't fall down. How can I repay your kindness? If I ask you for something, will you give it to me? What do you want? Tell me. What is it that you want, buddy? Liberate me. Please free me from life. I am unable to live. Be it life or death, its hell waiting for it. Please send me off. Raghava, please send me off. Please send me off. The life of an actor is filled with curses. Someone writes our story and someone paints over us. And someone else dresses us. And someone directs us and makes us stand in front of the public. The applause, praise, felicitations, the tokens of appreciation, the crowns, the awards we receive... The actor believes all these are truly his and lives in the delusion that he is a great man. He lies and deceives himself into thinking that he is the emperor of that pretend world. He loses himself in that maze. Even Chakri got lost in that typhoon. Along with that, the pain that he is childless, and the sadness of losing his wife... That's all. He couldn't stay neither in his house or his body. Chakri. I fed him death with the very same hands that I used to feed him. But even before the tears of that storm died down, my daughter got a mini-storm brewing at home. Raju's heart, that's as delicate as a Tulasi plant, was broken. Hello, father-in-law. Sree, these are two lakhs. Joseph is going to come home in the afternoon. This is the payment for the recording that we finished the other day. When he comes home this afternoon... What's going on? Why do all of you look so sad? Chakrapani uncle passed away. Sorry, father-in-law. Sorry. Oh my god. Hello, Joseph. I am sending you the location. Come home. - Okay. - I will sleep for a while. - Why are you burning up? - Nothing. It's just fever. I should be alright by the afternoon. Did you have your afternoon medicine, mother? Raju, what is this behavior like a small kid? Come... come... - Tiktok. - Yes, lady. - Get Orange juice ready for my mother. - Alright, lady. I'll come there. What is this, Raju? Why wouldn't you take care of your health? Yes, Salim. Thirty-two thousand? Alright. Will you come here and take it? Come. Chakri's hospital bill... - Tiktok? - Yes, lady. I put the money here. Where did they go? Money? - I didn't see it anywhere, lady. - Did you take it? Why would I take it, lady? It's okay if you need it. I won't say anything. I will give you the money later. Lady, I promise on my mother. I am not a thief. Well then, what happened? Mother, earlier... Oh, you took it? What is this, father? Couldn't you have asked me before taking it? What do you mean taking it after asking you? No joking, father. Didn't Rahul hand me some money right in front of you earlier? Mother, why would you take it without informing me? Shouldn't you have asked me? - My girl, that money... - Rahul gave it. What will Rahul think if he knows about this? Won't this cheapen our reputation? Why are you doing this, father? I don't understand what you're saying. She's accusing you of stealing their money. Don't you still understand? Your golden girl is calling you a thief. - Do you understand that now? - Mother, when did I say that he is a thief? What was it that I said? I said that if you need money, you can ask me before taking it. That's it! We are not in situation where we need to beg, my child. - I didn't mean that. - Did you call me a thief? - Father. - Did I steal? Did you just call Ranga Marthanda Raghava Rao a thief? Is this the money you were talking about? I earned crores... crores of rupees. I didn't care about anything. I gave away all the money I had without keeping anything for myself. - How could you call me a thief? - Why are you shouting, father? Why would I need your money? I just asked you why you took the money without telling me about it? Did I call you a thief? Did I? If you say another word, I will break your teeth. Mother. Mother, why are you scolding me? Say no more. Shut the hell up! Mother... Shut up! Mother... Shut up! Call the police. We will get to know the truth. Go! Mother... police. Go and call the police and then I'll tell you. Mother... Father... no... I deserve to be punished thus. - Father... - I deserve this punishment. - Father... - How could you call me a thief? I don't understand why you are shouting at me. What did I say? Get lost! She calls me a thief! She thinks I'm a thief! What's that money in your hand? I am so sorry, Rahul. The money that you gave me to hand over to Joseph, father took it without informing me. When I questioned him about it, my parents started shouting at me. What do you mean your father took the money? Joseph came a while back. I gave him the money already. You gave him the money? When was this? You were in the kitchen. You put the money on the sofa. He came. I took the money and gave it to him. That was the end of it. Well, what's this money for? What happened? I committed a grave mistake, Rahul. - Just what happened? - Father... Father, I am sorry. Did you lose something else, dear? - Mother, please tell him... - Go and search for it. Search that bag and suitcase. Check if we have stolen something else. Mother-in-law, please don't say that. She didn't know. I was the one who took that money. She didn't know and she misunderstood. Sorry, mother-in-law. Oh, you didn't lose the money? So, we are not thieves. Glad. - We are lucky. - Mother... Mother... Mother, you know about me, don't you? Please scold me or beat me up but don't talk to me like that. Shut up! Do you know where that money came from? When aunt Subbu died, he sold his favorite bracelet and paid for the hospital bills. How could you have called him a thief? Are you satisfied now? You called your children gems. See that. Take a good look at them. They are the finest of the lot. - Are you satisfied now? - Mother. - Are you satisfied now, husband? - Mother, please don't say that. - Father, please tell her that I am not that sort of a person. - I played many characters on the stage King, soldier, demon, drunkard, a gambler. But I never played the role of a thief. Because of you, I played that character as well. Father... It's okay, dear. I have played misguided roles and ended up alone. You are right to misunderstand. We are old people who are at the fag end of our lives. We are like the dogs who are chained to the corner. If you feed us, we would end up licking legs. Its not your mistake. Its not a mistake at all. Let's go, Raju. This chapter ends with a bang as well. You were right, Raju. Dhara Dattam. Money is the machine that runs the man and the world. No. I won't agree to this. Please don't over react to this, father. I told you that I made a mistake, didn't I? I made a mistake. I won't agree to the both of you leaving from here. If you move from here, I will commit suicide and die. I am serious, father. I will commit suicide and die. They cannot leave. Rahul. - They cannot leave. - Father-in-law, we are sorry. Please don't leave us. Mother-in-law, we are sorry. [Sree sobbing] Sree. Sree... its OK, Sree. Calm down, Sree. Calm down. It's OK, Sree. It's OK. Mom... [Sree sobbing] Let's leave. My golden girl. When she called you a thief, she is as good as dead to us. Let' not stay here any further. Come, let's go. (Song) Let's spend the night here. Raju, use this to keep warm. Don't be sad, husband. We came in between and we left in between too. I feel like a huge heaviness has left my heart. Let's go to the village, pray to the goddess. Call Koti and get our house repaired. I will clean the front yard everyday and decorate it with rangoli. Let's stay peacefully there. How much would we need? We just need to plant a few vegetables and that would be enough for us. I will cook you everything you like. Don't you think we can live that way? You are a king, my husband. Didn't you always tell me that a great man once told you this 'To be or not to be', that's not the question. You are for me and I am for you. Raju... Can I not be your philosopher and guide? My dear flower. Come, let's sleep. Come. Mother? Mother? Father? Father? Tiktok? Tiktok? Tiktok? Yes, lady. I'm coming. How many times do I have to call you? Where are mom and dad? - They left last night. - Last night... - What happened? - Why didn't you wake us? I thought it would be better for them to leave rather than staying here, lady. What the hell are you saying? First, call your brother-in-law Call your brother-in-law. Everyone one is interested in doling out their opinions. Shouldn't you have told us when it was happening? Brother, did mom and dad come there? What do you mean? They are not here. They went somewhere. Did they come to you? They went somewhere? Where did they go? We don't know that. I called to see if they came to you. You must have done something wrong. What did you do? Hello? Sree? Hello? Rahul? [devotional chants on speaker] Raju, get up. It's morning. Raju? Raju, wake up. Koti... Raju? The bus that will take us to our village is going to be here soon. Please, wake up. Raju? Raju? Raju? Raju, please wake up. Raju? Raju, please wake up. Raju, it's day. Raju, why are you still sleeping? Raju, it's almost time. We need to call Koti. Raju? Raju, please wake up. Raju? Raju? Raju, the bus is going to be here soon. Raju? Raju? Please wake up. When we go to our village, we can sleep however long we want Please wake up. Raju, I am scared. Raju. Raju, I am scared. Please wake up. Raju, we are getting late. Raju? - Raju? - She's gotten cold, sir. - She is dead. - Hey! Don't you know the difference between being dead and sleeping? Raju? Raju? Please wake up. Usually, she wakes by five in the morning. Raju, we've travelled quite far. She must be tired. Raju, please don't pull a prank on me. Raju? Raju, please wake up. Raju, I am scared. Raju, please wake up. Raju? Raju? Raju? (Song) Raju... Raju... Raju... See how big a monster I am. 'I don't exist without you.' Look how wonderfully I delivered that dialogue. And you believed me, my naive woman. I am still alive. See this. I acted really well as a husband. The life of a human is all an act. Veturi said this. All are parts to play. Shakespeare, Kalidas, Bhavbhuti... Samuel Beckett, Chekov, Joshua, Gurujada. Balijepalli, Pingali, Atreya... Anni Shetty, Pini Shetty... all of them ******! They wanted to vent out their frustrations and wrote it down and died. And me here... I've changed my face in accordance with the roles I play... ...playing them to degrees of perfection, and desired laurels. I experienced the pain, happiness and anger of these roles... ...that I have played profoundly. I've been proud of the cheer and money I got and felt like the king of the world. And the people applauded me after the play finished and they went to their homes. And I am here all alone. Along with the dead bodies of those roles. I played and displayed pain of each of the roles through my acting skills. And now, my pain... And those roles roam around me like ghosts. Despite being alive, they are eating me away to death. I am not those roles. I am not those parts. Then, who am I? - Then, who am I? - Father? - Father? - Who is that? Who is that? Who is that? Father? Father, it's me... Ranga. What Ranga? Is it a crematorium or battle field? Why would you say that, father-in-law? This is your son, Ranga. Where did you go? Do you know how much we searched for you? The queen daughter-in-law... and her dollars. I've been searching for you as well, dear. I didn't find any of you anywhere. - It's dark. - Father, where is mother? - Where is mother-in-law? - She died. Mom In a place where people moved about like crows... On hard earth... When the children she has given birth to have brutally betrayed her, ...and the husband she loved dearly... She was worried about what would happen to her husband. She died of a broken heart. She left me an orphan and went away. Mother... Mother... Father? Stop that! If you come any closer, I will kill you. I rose up as the ultimate power in the three worlds... I locked up the rulers of the eight directions... I'm the one who unearthed the Mount Kailasa on which Lord Shiva sits. I'm the ten headed Ravana! I... ...am the one who couldn't come to terms with self deceit and left the kingdom. I am that King Lear. I am 'Rakthakanneeru' Gopalam who thought life is a play in the light and dark. I'm Gireesham of 'Damn it! Katha Addam Thirigindi' I'm Murari for whom mere applause was a feast. I am the ultimate form of Lord Nataraja that appeared in thousands of forms. I'm the Rangamarthanda Raghava Rao! [laughs] - [Raghava Rao groans] - Father! - Father-in-law... - Sir! Sir! Sir... Sir... [Rahava Rao groans in pain] Father... Do you get it Siddartha? Acting is nothing but jumping into a furnace. You turn to ashes. Only the roles would remain. Be it an actor or Lord Nataraja... All that is left at last is... the spring season of graveyard. [Raghava Rao gasps] [Raghava Rao squeals] Father! Father! [Geetha sobbing] Father! Father-in-law! "Where is your abode? Isn't it the stage?" "Which is your court? Isn't it the Virata Parvam?" "Has your living in disguise ended?" "What do you know about war?" "What victory have you seen" "All you have done is acting but you haven't gained experience from it!" YOU ARE BORN ALONE, YOU DIE ALONE, BETWEEN BOTH, YOU ACT, THE WORLD ACTS. YOU ARE BORN ALONE, YOU DIE ALONE, BETWEEN BOTH, YOU ACT, THE WORLD ACTS. YOU ARE BORN ALONE, YOU DIE ALONE, BETWEEN BOTH, YOU ACT, THE WORLD ACTS.
