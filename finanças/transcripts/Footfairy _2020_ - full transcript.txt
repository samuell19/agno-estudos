Please pay attention. The last local for Borivali is arriving at platform three at 11:20 p.m… Next station: Goregaon. The darkness will creep up behind you To sting. Time will outrun you The morning is still far away. Only darkness shall stand by you Till the end. Accidents lurk at every step. Waiting to pounce on you. They'll latch onto you Even if you try to get away. Yeah, Harsh? We found one more. Okay, I'm coming. Who found it? An on-duty lineman. Anyone touched it yet? No. You'd given instructions, so the police informed us directly. Any footprints? No. The bag is of the same size. Hmm. The method is similar too. Once again, he kills her somewhere else and dumps the body here for our convenience. How sweet of him! We should personally thank him for this. Just wait till we meet him. Harsh. Question those people. Ask them if they saw something. Okay. Vivaan. Hmm? Ever seen something like this before? Fourth corpse in the last four months. This is bad news for us. We must locate the actual crime scene, Harsh. At any cost. No, Vivaan. I don't think we'll find a clue at the actual crime scene. He doesn't look like someone who makes mistakes. He's too smart. Murder for him is not just lust or violence. It's about possession. It gives him a high. Once he realizes his victims are breathless and are inching closer to their deaths, it literally trips him out. That's exactly when he'd make a mistake. Hopefully! And we need to find that mistake. That's when our investigation will find a proper direction. Footprints, hair sample, we could find anything. Poor Mishra lost all his hair in a bid to find the hair samples. He was left only with samples, lost all his hair. What do you think? You're right. Mr Mishra was a great investigator. I think, he'd use Google for his searches. "Top ten ways to catch a serial killer" or something. Frankly, I'm glad he was transferred. Do you think I don't look that stuff up? The Internet is down or else the killer would have been… - You would've screwed him, right? - Obviously. This night is too short For our long chats. Why are you so aloof? This night is too short For our long chats. - Hi, Richa. - Hello. - Good morning. - Good morning. School? College. In Delhi, you call it school, in Mumbai after tenth grade, it's college. I'm so sorry. I tend to forget. Yes, going to college. Isn't your college opposite that famous vadapav joint? Very funny. - That joint is opposite my college. - I see. How will you get there? A rickshaw to the railway station and then I'll walk from there. In this weather, you won't find a rickshaw. Let me drop you. No, it's okay. Hello, Ms Okay. Everything is okay, okay? Give me the umbrella. I'll bring my car around. How am I looking? - Good. - Cool. This is the fourth murder by the Strolley Killer. Local trains are considered the lifeline of Mumbai. What measures are the government taking for their safety? Or are they just twiddling their thumbs? The fourth murder took place on the Western line where four million people commute every day. Who will take their responsibility? Does the government have an answer? A senior officer of this department would often say: "To understand an artist, you must look at his paintings carefully." But this artist and his paintings… I just don't understand. Why does he stuff the corpses in bags before dumping them? The killer saws off his victims' feet and keeps them. Expecting logic from this guy is a waste of time. Did the latest victim also wear open footwear? It is not confirmed yet, sir. But based on the killer's pattern, I'm sure Rita Madhav must have worn open footwear. Hmm. Apart from the fact that all the victims traveled by train, you found any common factors or connections? No, sir. Nothing so far. None of them knew each other and there's no common factor. But this is what we're trying to crack. The day we find the common factor… We'll be very close to catching this guy. Vivaan, we have to catch this monster as early as possible. Yes, sir. Even Mishra couldn't find anything. And you know the pressures. And I don't want to be a part of any news debate where I have to defend myself. Yes, sir. Let our actions speak. I trust you. - Yes, sir. - That's why you're here. - Sir. - Hmm, Rishabh? That night, she left at around 10 p.m. Her friends said she always traveled by train. - What about her family? - Locals. She lived with her parents in Goregaon. Dad is a banker and mom, a housewife. Goregaon Station, 10th August. Line up the CCTV footage. Maybe she got off the train after 10:30. - Find and you call me immediately, okay? - Okay, sir. - Vivaan. - Huh? I got a call from the lab. Did you find something new or same as before? I'm afraid, no. The MO is identical. No signs of sexual assault on her body. The victim has died due to asphyxiation. She was deprived of oxy… Yes, I understand. Asphyxiation. Look at her legs. Her feet were chopped off by a saw or something. That's why it's a little uneven. There are no traces of saliva, fingerprints, blood or hair on her body. That means, same as before. And the strolley bag? Clean. It's useless. Let me see. I'd feel so terrible. I couldn't imagine the plight of the victims' families. They must go through a lot. Never knew there would come a day when I also would have to… It's fine. Yeah, you wanted to ask me something? Right. Did she make any new friends… Anything odd about that relationship? No. Rita was a decent girl. She'd focus on work, had only a few friends in our neighbourhood. Do you think that whatever happened to Rita - was done by someone she knew? - No. Look, we can't confirm anything right now, Mr Madhav. We're checking every lead. If you recall anything, or if you find out something, do inform us. Did Rita ever tell you that someone was following her or did she suspect she was being followed? No. Never. I found no leads from this strolley bag. It is just like those other three bags. There are almost 288 registered stores in Mumbai. There must be thousands across Maharashtra. - If it was bought from another state… - Forget it. Once we narrow down the search criteria, then we'll waste time on it. Don't sweat it. Sir, I found it. Look at the left corner. Estimated time of death? Approximately at midnight. The footage says 11:35. Almost half an hour. The strolley bag was found almost 100 meters from the station. Right. Harsh. - Get all the units. - Okay. Rishabh, a little further. Jadhav, look there. Look here. Sir, check this out. Come here! Come, sir. Look at this. I think this is it. Of course, this is it. Okay, so… The victim's house is almost two-hundred meters from here in the east. Suppose she… Took this route… The suspect waited for a while, attacked her at the right moment. Then he carried her… And brought her here. Right! This is the spot. And then… Maybe he took 15 minutes to chop her feet off. And then may be he double-checked if she's dead. His planning is near perfect, so he must've hidden the strolley bag somewhere here. Look for the wheel marks of the bag. - Check it. - Yes, sir. Okay. So now… He had to take the strolley bag to the final spot. He took the victim there… And stuffed her in the bag. And… Sir. Footprint. The CBI seems to have found new evidence in the Strolley Killer Case. Even though the same hasn't been confirmed, it is possible that this evidence will tilt this case into a new direction and the CBI might catch the perp soon. Hello. Hello, how are you? I'm fine. I just have a headache, that's all. Richa? At college. She didn't even eat breakfast. - She was running late, so she left. - I see. Did you find a cook? No, you were going to send someone, right? Oh damn! I am getting so forgetful. - I'll tell you as soon as I find one. - No problem. - Please let me know. - Sure. - Okay, bye. - Okay. Rishabh has something to show you. Then say it, Rishabh. Only you have something to say, not us. I can neither find a cook nor a clue to the killer. Sir… I see a strange connection in this case. I mean, take a look. These are the CCTV videos from stations for second and third murder. Look at this man, sir. In both videos, when the victim walked past him, he started following her like a shadow. There is more. This is the first and fourth. Exactly similar style, sir. So a similar looking man got off the train as an ordinary passenger and followed the victim. I'm damn sure, sir, it's the same guy. Same height, same built. What do you think, Vivaan? Is he the one? I don't know. What are the odds! It couldn't have been a mere coincidence. Four murders, four men of the same built, similar khaki pants. The boot print was size ten, right? Right. He is almost 5'11. Yes, almost. I think it's him. It means he doesn't choose his victims randomly. He follows them and then kills them. Sir… All the victims boarded the train from Bandra. Should I check the footage? Maybe a better shot while boarding the train? It's pointless. He's wearing a cap for a reason. He knows the angles of the CCTV cameras. He won't make the mistake of showing his face anywhere. He's too smart. These khaki pants look like a taxi driver's uniform. It could be. Maybe the killer is a taxi driver. It's possible. If he carries a strolley bag, nobody would suspect him. Yes, but can a taxi driver be that smart? We don't know if a taxi driver can be that smart, but the killer is definitely smart enough to disguise himself as a taxi driver and kill. Send a team to the Western line stations. Check if anyone saw something suspicious. Inquire with every stall and bar around the area. Okay, sir. - Harsh. - Yes? Get a list of all the taxi permits issued in the past six months from the union. Okay. - Vivaan. - Sir. I got a call from the Commissioner's office. Three knives were found in a taxi driver's bag at a checkpoint. They were covered in blood. The cops wanted to stop him, but he tried to escape. Where is he now? Bandra Police Station. It's being said that the suspect apprehended is the Strolley Killer. He had caused much trouble for the people of Mumbai. It's still an ongoing investigation. Shit. Who invited the circus? Someone tipped them off. You give a tip and also receive a tip later. Get them out of here. - Kamble, throw them out. - Sure. Who caught him? Constable Jiten Mangley. - Mangley! - Yes, sir. Let's start from the beginning. It's routine, sir. It was a routine checkpoint at Hill Road. I stopped him and searched his cab. I found a bag. I asked him about the contents, he tried to flee. So I chased him right away. I jumped over a divider, chased him for more than half a mile. I nabbed him finally. Where is he now? In the remand room. Your name? Shashikant More, sir. Why did you try to run? I'm a poor man. Those cops… I mean the officers caught me. They wanted to search my cab. I had cannabis in my bag. I was headed for a delivery. I tried to flee because I was scared. Cannabis? I drive a cab at night. It doesn't pay much these days. Then this Uber and other cab services… It just ruined my business. My family lives in a village. I have kids. I need money to raise them. So I moonlight once a while. And the three knives? The blood on them… Those are not mine! They belong to Arshad. I told the officer they weren't mine. But he didn't listen. You should check them. Arshad is from my village. He is a butcher, sir. He owns a chicken shop in Ma him. Sir, if you don't believe me, come with me. I'll show you. He went back to the village and left those knives in my bag. I'm so damn unlucky. Sir. I'm very poor. I'm very poor, sir! Sir, please let me go. Forgive me. Check if he's telling the truth. He's a hustler, he can't be the Strolley Killer. Strolley Killer! Anyway, I hate the name strolley killer. Oh! Finally! I thought you'd never show up. Actually, that's what I thought. I can't help it. I can't find a cook. So I decided to eat home-cooked meal instead of eating out. - Oh wow! - Nobody refuses free drinks, right? The blood report is here. The blood on the knife was of chicken. I'm so surprised, Harsh. Look. We even found two witnesses. He was in his village at the time of the second murder and he drove to Virar at the time of the third. That's what I like about you. You follow orders, but not before checking the facts. Absolutely. Good! Keeps a check on me, Harsh. Yes, come. An is ha. - Hey, An is ha. So sorry, I'm late. - Hi, Vivaan. No problem. I just finished cooking. Superb, great. Vivaan, this is my college friend, Devika. Hi. Hi. Vivaan. - Hi, Devika. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Devika, he is my boss. Hey! Devika is a… PD… - Pediatrician. - Yes. Kids' doctor. You know, sometimes I wonder how you passed the bureau exam. You must have cheated. Come on, be honest. - Cheating… - That's how he married me. Man! I heard at a seminar that a particular event in their lives acts as a trigger. That trigger turns these normal people into the Devil. For years, researchers have been trying to find out what triggers them, as you said what makes someone a serial killer or a psychopath. But there are no concrete answers so far. But there's one thing. All serial killers are psychopathic. But all psychopaths are not serial killers. You know, Vivaan? Devika is obsessed with stories - about serial killers. - What! - I'm not obsessed, okay? - Really? But yes, I'm definitely fascinated. - Really? - Yes. I mean, it is fascinating that most of these serial killers look so unassuming, right? They look normal. Middle-class, 9 to 5 types. But when you decipher their thoughts that's when you get shocked. A few days ago, I was telling someone about Ted Bundy. I mean, nobody could look at him and say he was a necrophiliac. Having sex with his victims' dead bodies until they start decomposing! You know, there are many jerks like Ted Bundy. Have you read about Jerry Brudos? - Somewhat similar to our killer. You must be knowing. - Yeah. He was also obsessed with ladies' footwear. Once, he killed a 19-year-old girl and chopped off her left leg for his personal collection. Before disposing of the body, he'd cut his victims' right breast and make a mold out of it to use it as a paper weight. Wow! Yeah, fascinating, isn't it? Okay, enough now. Please exchange numbers, guys. You can have this intense conversation elsewhere, okay? For now, shall we continue the game? - Yeah. - Yeah, sorry. The next train expected at platform three… Yeah, Harsh? Foot Fairy. It seems, he also didn't like the name Strolley Killer. Who found it? The slum kids. They come here to play every day. Crime scene? In a ladies' restroom close by. There is blood everywhere. Any footprints? No. The floor was wet. His confidence is growing by the day. This time, he didn't even try to hide the crime scene. His murder rate is also increasing. Two this month. And the month hasn't even ended yet. Sir. Why did he change the pattern this time? He didn't change his pattern. He is being overconfident. He is bored of dumping bodies in strolley bags. Now he's playing games with us. He's challenging us. This makes one thing very clear. He doesn't miss any piece of news about himself. In fact… He'd be collecting news articles. He waits for the Foot Fairy news to hit the channels. He gets high by dominating his victims and now he wants to be a celebrity, to be seen on every news channel. Bastard! He's loving it. Now we must think like him, Harsh. Hmm. Mr Deshmukh. - Yes? - It is semen. We are sending this sample to Delhi for cross-referencing. Only they have a DNA database - of sexual offenders. - Right. Okay. - We'll keep in touch. - Okay, thanks. Vivaan, do you really think the semen belongs to the killer? Honestly, I think this semen doesn't belong to the killer. Think about it. He never even left a hair strand behind. Suddenly we found a tsunami of semen! Why? A tsunami of semen? Honestly! Harsh, you're a funny guy. A tsunami of semen. That's a good one. Look, I'm not sure if this tsunami of semen, as you say, belongs to the Foot Fairy. But let's see! Let's find out whom it belongs to. And remember that one mistake, Harsh. Mistakes are made when you're high. Maybe that's his mistake. Hmm. By the way, it's Vanessa's prayer meeting today. Vanessa D'Souza, the first victim. So? Hari, come in. Anything? No, sir. Sir. Do you think he'll show up? I don't know. But there's no harm if we try. There are many cases where the killer visits their victims. You know, on special days like birthdays. It gives them a sense of power. Hmm. Power? Imagine you have a power to decide who should live or die, won't you consider yourself God? Sir? He's here, he's here. - Shit! - Hurry! Hari, he's on the run! He's on the run! - He's getting away. - Move! He's getting away. Get him! - Come on! - Hurry! This way! He went that way. - Wait! - Hey! Get him! Cover the back exit! Wait! - Move it! - Move your vehicle! Hurry up! Move it! Shit! Rishabh, check the footprints. Okay, sir. Good evening, everyone. As you all know, this killer communicated with us directly. He… Called himself the Foot Fairy. More details will be delivered by Vivaan Deshmukh. Assistant Joint Director, Special Crimes Division. He took charge of this case a couple of days ago. Good evening, everyone. As you all may know, we're still investigating this. So I can't share all the information with you. But I can assure you that we're trying our best. We found some evidence that is being evaluated now. You can help us find the culprit too. We've set up a hotline number that you can call on to contact us any time of the day. Our guess is that the killer has an average built. He may be 25 to 35 years old. Approximate height: 5'11. If you find someone suspicious, please call the hotline immediately or you may head to a branch of Special Crimes Division. Your safety is our responsibility. Please stay alert. We know that the people of Mumbai consider themselves safe and we hope to maintain that trust. Thank you. Glory to India. Look at you. You don't look nervous at all. - Handling like a pro, huh! - What rubbish! I hate media briefings, interviews or any kind of public speaking. I hate it! - Really? - Yeah. I thought you got used to it after the Yamuna River Case. Okay, tell me. How's the investigation going? Fine. - Fine? - Yeah. You know? This is what everyone talks about even during breaks. Really? I think it's become the favorite topic of the nation. - You're right. - Like… The nation wants to know who the Foot Fairy is. The nation wants to know who the Foot Fairy is! - Okay. - I see. Shh, sorry, sorry. By the way, do you guys treat patients at the hospital or do you kill your time with gossip out there? Very funny! But yes, who doesn't like mysteries? Okay, tell me. If a girl has dirty feet… Dirty! Do you think he'll attack her? I'm sorry, dirty means? - You know? Like dirty. Cracked skin… - Oh my God! - Yuck! Stop it! - Not pedicured, smelly. - What? - Gosh! Disgusting! I've lost my appetite. Tell me. Well, you know, everyone has a secret obsession. This Foot Fairy could have too. Just imagine, he collects his victims' feet. Only he knows what goes on in his head. You think the Foot Fairy would like my feet? I mean, you think he'll attack me? Are my feet pretty enough for the Foot Fairy? Are they pretty enough? No more questions, this press conference is over. Thank you for coming. The food was actually good. - It was great. - Yeah. - It was even better because of you… - Yeah. - Is this your car? - Yes, it is. I'll see you. Bye. Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. - See you. - Take care. Well, your feet are pretty. Okay, Star! Get in. So how is school? College. Fine. How's college? What's going on these days? It's good. We're busy with exams. Exams? - All the best. Do well. - Thank you. - Did you prepare? - Yes. By what time do you get back home? Mostly by 8 p.m. After extra lessons, I chill with my friends for a while then I catch the 7:12 p.m. express train. Okay. Hello? Mr Deshmukh? This is Murthy from FSL, Delhi. Yes, Mr Murthy? You had sent evidence item number 566 - 34J56, right? - Yes. We found a positive match. Oh, that's great. The sample is of Ravi Kale. Last year, Mumbai Police arrested him - for a sexual assault. - I see. In October. Last year. Do you have his address? I'm afraid not. That's okay, I'll find it. Please email me the report. I'll do that. Thank you, Mr Murthy. Sir. Ravi Kale. We arrested him last year for sexual assault. But we didn't find any evidence against him, he was released in ten days. Do you have his latest address? Yes, I do. He lives nearby. Is he there yet? Not yet, sir. Okay, okay. Are you sure he still lives here? Yes, sir. Hundred percent. But I am not sure. About what? Whether he is the Foot Fairy or not. But he fits the profile based on the sexual charges. He is well-educated. His shoe size is 10 and lives close to the crime scene. Most importantly, his semen was found near the body. Harsh, has your semen ever ended up somewhere it shouldn't be? He's going to the left, a girl is with him. Okay, grab him as soon as he gets out. He is here. - Back off! - Move, move! Get him! - From the side! - Stop! Catch him! Turn around. Why run if you did nothing wrong? I swear, I did nothing wrong. I thought he was Afzal's man. I'd borrowed 300,000 from him. Now I don't even have a job. How do I pay him back? We found your magazine that had your prints and your semen. It was three feet away from the body. Magazine? - Which magazine? What… - Hey! Stop this drama. Confess your crime or we'll break your bones. Okay? I did nothing wrong. What should I confess? Sir, I'm telling the truth. I know nothing about a magazine. Look. Do you remember it now? You turned this soft cover into a hard cover and you don't remember? How can I tell you about this? I'm embarrassed. Start talking! Once I beat the hell out of you, you will be embarrassed forever. Get it? Get it? Speak up! Sir, I live in a small house and my relatives have come over. I took the magazine to my car and jerked off a bit… A bit? You call this a bit? I felt relieved. Then I threw this magazine near the railway track. I swear, sir. Forgive me, sir. I haven't done anything else. I'm telling the truth. What do you think? Is he telling the truth? I'm not sure, sir. Hold him in custody. Take good care of him. We might find out something more. Sir, I feel really bad for him. Why? Poor man… He just went out to jerk off and that shook up his whole life. Yes, Dr Bhogle? Yes, Mr Deshmukh. The handwriting analyst has confirmed that the body inscriptions and the suspect's handwriting don't match. Okay, thank you. Sir… He has two strong witnesses. Who? On the night of the fifth murder, he was at Sai Shakti Bar, Marine drive and on the night of the third murder, he was at Mantra Bar, Andheri East. We are screwed again! Back to zero again! Forget it! Let's have lunch. The taxi union has sent a report. 275 permits were issued in the last six months. Should we follow up? Let it be. The taxi angle is wrong. But where did we get this angle from? Sir… - The khaki pants. - Right. I own three khaki pants. You would have too. Anybody can wear khaki pants. Yeah, right. You were right, Harsh. This semen can't belong to the Foot Fairy. We wasted our time. No, Vivaan. If I were in your place, I would've done the same. As a lead investigator, you can't overlook any facts. Relax. Don't take so much stress. What is it? Why are you looking here? Eat your food. Anyway… We have to find something before Mr Saleem's patience wears thin. One more thing, sir. There is a weird connection in all the cases. I mean, it may be completely irrelevant. - But… - Say it. Okay, sir. There is a restaurant in Bandra. So? All our victims have visited it. Two weeks before they were murdered. And three of them had gone there two days before their murder. And? Why didn't you tell us this earlier? You remembered everything about khaki pants. Why didn't you say this earlier? Get the details and send it to me as soon as possible. Yes, sir. Listen. I'm going to Thane Jail tomorrow. The warden wants to see me. There is a prisoner who wants to share some information with us. Shall we? See if you can find anything. Anything else? You want to eat or to say something? No, sir. - Should I get the bill? - Yes, sir. Thanks, Vivaan for helping me shop. My pleasure. I thought it would be a great opportunity for me to shop as well. Why do you look so exhausted? Didn't you sleep all night? I just worked all night. Any breakthrough? Had we found any clue, it would've been on the news by now. I think the media will find the Foot Fairy before we do. So I won't get any confidential information from you. Like they say, if you tell me, you'll have to shoot me, right? Of course. Is it? Professional ethic! Fine, Mr Vivaan Deshmukh. I won't share my highly confidential baby medical files with you then. Doctor-patient code. Okay? I never asked for them. Not even if you do. You ask all the questions. - I see. I ask all the questions? - Yes. Okay, fine. Continue with your shopping. No, I'm serious. Ninety percent of the calls are crank calls. "I think my neighbour is the Foot Fairy. My father-in-law keeps staring at my feet, he is the Foot Fairy. My mother-in-law is the Foot Fairy, arrest her." Oh God. It gets so irritating at times. Sometimes I think the hotline was a really bad idea. It's like those crank calls we'd make as kids. I must tell you this. The other day, a client was telling me that she doesn't travel alone at night anymore and also forbids her daughter. She also asked her daughter not to wear heels, stilettos or any kind of fancy footwear. Only sneakers. The foot has to be fully covered. What's the use of a pedicure then? No use. By the way, I'm not surprised by this. My friend Aditi has stopped getting pedicures from men. These people don't even travel by train. I mean, this man kills people near the railway station, but the entire city is terrified. Hello? Yes? Yes, Aditi? Hi. Yes. Yeah. Yes. Yes, he is here. Yes. What? Did you solve the case? Hundred percent, he'll love the intern. Aditi, I'll call you later. Okay? Okay, bye. What? Which case? I was just telling you about her and she called. She was saying that… There's a joint in Bandra named Lock Stock &amp; Burgers. The owner of that joint is the Foot Fairy. And she wants you to go arrest him. I think I've heard this name before. What name? The one you were saying, Lock Stock… - Lock Stock &amp; Burgers? - Yeah. Yes, you might have. It's a famous joint. Why does your friend think that the owner is the Foot Fairy? Aditi? She is mad. Totally crazy. You know but this man is obsessed with feet. For the first time, I've heard about a man who goes to a spa this regularly. And he keeps staring at other women's feet. And he advises them about cracks, moisturizers… Sea salt scrub and things like that. - He advised me once, but I ignored it. - Is it? A very knowledgeable guy. In fact, he is the first man who only looks at women's feet. Otherwise you know where men look. We will definitely arrest him. Do you know him? Why? Are you jealous? Jealous? Yes? He just looks at feet, right? Is it? Wow, very smart, Mr Vivaan Deshmukh. Having fun? - Your parcel, sir. - Oh, that was quick. Yeah. By the way, who owns this place? Sorry, I don't know who owns this property. No, not the property. I mean this restaurant. Oh! Mr Joshua, sir. - Mr. Joshua? - Yeah. Is he from Mumbai? No, he is not from Mumbai, but he's been around here for months. But sir, I don't know much about it. I mean I'm here since March, the day this joint was opened. That's it. Can I meet him? As in I want to congratulate him, you know… Such a wonderful place, lovely interiors such a friendly staff, quick service. Thank you, sir, but sorry, he is out of the city now. He'll back in a few days. - He'll meet you next time when you come. - Okay. - Thank you so much. - Thank you, sir. - Thank you, visit again, sir. - Sure, sure. - Okay. - Bye, sir. Vivaan. Do you really think the restaurant owner is a suspect? Are you serious? You aren't joking, right? Have you seen his Facebook page? I checked it out last night. He has liked many pages related to foot fetish. Check for yourself. But Vivaan… If I like Deepika and Katrina's Facebook pages, it doesn't mean I'll become a suspect if someone stalks them. - Come on, I think… - Harsh, listen to me. Listen to me, Harsh! I know it sounds a bit absurd but I'm sure we'll find a clue there. - Vivaan. - Listen to me. Joshua came back from Mhapsa, Goa. Exactly two months before the first murder. Later, we've had a series of murders. I know, Vivaan, but see… - Just a minute, listen to me. - See. Nothing is common among all the victims except this restaurant. Right? Right. Yeah, right? Check these comments. Yes. "You are seriously a freak. Weirdo." - Oh! - Now look at this. "What sort of a man is so obsessed with women's feet?" Tell me something, do you know somebody… Who is so obsessed over women's feet? I'm sure your answer is 'no', right? I don't know. But I seriously doubt it. I think we're just wasting our time. I know your doubts are always backed by logic, but… - This is a bit illogical. - Just trust me on this one. Just get the details. Okay, can you do that? Okay, sir. You are the boss. The nearby restaurant? - The burgers are very famous, try them. - Really? You go there regularly? No, sir. Why? Don't you like burgers? No, sir, That's not true. I used to go there with my friends… Hmm? - The owner, Joshua… - Yes? He is our privileged customer. - Joshua? - Yes, he comes here regularly. But… But? I stopped going there. He is a bit weird. Weird? How? Whenever he comes here for a massage, he… He stares at my feet in a weird way. In a bad way. Once he even tried touching my feet. Oh, my God! He is very strange and weird. Sir, can I say something honestly? Yes? Sometimes I think he is the Foot Fairy. No, sir, seriously. I didn't think of it at first. I've thought about it now. Whenever there is a murder, he disappears for the next three to four days. How can you be so sure? Because for those three to four days, he neither comes here nor is he at the restaurant. He must be working from home. He must be busy or something. It doesn't mean that… No, sir. I have a friend who works at his restaurant. He's my neighbor. Sometimes we go home together. Once I just asked him casually. - Oh! - I didn't ask him directly. I wanted some information about Joshua. He told me his boss isn't home. That he is out of station. Out of station. Isn't it weird, sir? It is weird. - Vivaan. - Yes. The girl from the foot spa was right. The building watchman couldn't confirm the date, but he was sure that our guy goes away for three to four days. It has happened for three-four times during these murders. Interesting. Sir. I tried to get some information about him from Mhapsa. And sir, you won't believe what I found. What? They found two dead girls within a month. And both had their legs missing. Sir. But was Joshua there when these murders took place? I am not sure whether he was there at the time of both the murders. The second girl was fished out of the lake behind the church and Joshua left only a week ago from there. - Are you sure? - Yes, sir. I called Mhapsa Police Station to get some information. Strangely, they recognized Joshua right away. He had a girlfriend named Priya Mihre. They'd often fight and she'd call the police. In fact, sir, on 21st Jan a complaint was registered against him. Sir. One second. Good job. Good. Hello. Yes. - Yes. - Do you have his girlfriend's number? Yes, sir. Over here. Good job, Rishabh. Well done. Thank you, sir. Hello. - Hello, Ms. Priya Mihre. - Yeah? This is Vivaan Deshmukh, from CBI, Mumbai. We need some information about a man. We found out that you know him socially. Who? Joshua Matthews. It would help us a lot if you cooperate with us. Something wrong with him? Aren't you in touch with him? Mr Deshmukh, right? Yes. Forget about me, I say no one should stay in touch with him. But… I don't get it. What happened? I don't know if you are following the news or not, but a serial killer is on a rampage in Mumbai. And Joshua is a suspect? What do you think? If he is a suspect, I won't be surprised. But how can I help you? I just need some basic information. You must know about his foot obsession… Foot fetish, right? It's true. He is a freak. He is not normal. I'm so glad I left him. Ms. Priya, was he ever abusive with you… physically? Yes, Mr. Deshmukh, a lot of times. In fact, you won't believe it. The last time I met him, he slapped me so hard that I fainted. And that was it. I went to the police station, filed a complaint and left him. Oh, I'm really sorry to hear that. Anything else that can be helpful for us? Something weird or dangerous? There's something that I have shared with a very few people. But it has happened to me twice. It's not normal. Weird and scary. What is it? He tried to suffocate me. Suffocate? He covered my face with a pillow while we were laughing. And he started pressing it hard, like really hard. After a point, I couldn't breath. I started screaming and retaliating physically. And only after a point, He took the pillow away. Didn't you ask him why he did so? I did ask him, but he started laughing out loud. He said it was his childhood game. But trust me, Mr. Deshmukh. This is not a childhood game for him. I could feel him enjoying suffocating me. Ms. Priya, may I ask you a direct question? Yes. As much as you know him, do you think can Joshua murder someone? Oh yes, Mr. Deshmukh. For sure. Thank you, Ms. Priya. Thank you for your help. Okay, tell me. Is "Feets" a word? Ha, ha, very funny. Yes, ma'am, it's ready. Oh! Smells good. Vivaan's tasty and delicious instant noodles with chopsticks. Enjoy! Thank you. By the way… I got a call from my dad. I see. We talked about you. What did you talk about? That you're handling the Foot Fairy case. You're heading a team. And? And that, you are not a typical civilian. Yes. You too have professional ethics and codes like the military people. Yes, ma'am. Professional ethics and codes. But today, I am going to break my professional codes and ethics. Because you deserve to know. We got our first break and the credit goes to you. Okay. I didn't get you. Your friend. - Yes? - That restaurant. Its owner. His weirdness. Wait… My friend, Aditi. And the owner? Joshua? Are you serious? I mean, is he your suspect or… Okay, fine. You can't tell me, but… Seriously? This is really screwed up. Why screwed up? I mean, you are not telling me now. Guessing from your calculations, he is your suspect, right? What if later they prove him innocent? I will feel guilty. You can't suspect a poor man because I said… Why are you laughing? You are taking it too far. I put this idea into your head. Okay. Firstly, I don't believe in gossip. I've cross-checked everything. And secondly, my team member Rishabh had already pointed this out. So, please enjoy Vivaan special, yummy, tasty dish and don't give yourself all the credit. So it's credit? Okay. One second. Hi. - Hi. - What's this? Grandma has prepared carrot pudding for you. This is Devika. And this is Richa. - Hello. - Hi. Is she the same Richa you often talk about? Yes, she is the one whose college is just opposite the famous vadapav joint… The same… Very funny! Your grandma didn't find me a cook, so I made Vivaan special. Would you like to try some? Sorry, actually I need to complete my homework. Okay. - Bye. Nice meeting you. - Bye. She is so cute. Isn't she? These are Joshua's phone records. His phone was switched off at the time of the first and fourth murder. He was near the spot where the second, third, and the fifth murder took place. Within the radius of more than half a mile. And you still think he is clean? Not exactly, but it could also be circumstantial. Look, you're right to point out that he had some connection with… Harsh, I'm telling you. Whatever clues we've found so far can't be coincidental. I like this guy. He is our prime suspect. He's a bit weird. They found two dead girls within a month. Both the girls had their feet missing. …he tried to suffocate me. He's the first man I know who looks only at a girl's feet. His phone was switched off at the time of the first and fourth murder. He was near the spot where the second, third, fifth murder took place. It's not just a childhood game for him. I could feel him… Sometimes I think he is the Foot Fairy. He is obsessed with… Two girls were killed within a month. No, Vivaan. How can you expect me to issue a search warrant based on these proofs? The magistrate will file a case against me. And you very well know. These are not even circumstantial. Could you find only him in the entire city who has no previous record? Sir, you know how unusual this case is. The suspects will also be unusual. I have a very strong feeling about this man, so if you… - Vivaan! - Please trust me on… I'm not against you. Think about it from my point of view. There is a panic in Mumbai, everyone is questioning me. And I have no answers. Now you want me to let you pursue this lead on that basis? You get something more. I will try my best to get you a warrant. Saleem Sir is right. We need something substantial. Or else the media will roast us even before the court. But what are we supposed to find? I mean, we have no direction. We saw so many possibilities with this suspect. The rest were dismissed… Hello. Sure? Okay. Our burger boy is back in town. He is at his restaurant right now. Come on. Let's say hello to the Foot Fairy. Sorry, sir. We're shut for the day. Joshua Mathews. Actually… Mr Joshua… She is the one. "Cappuccino with extra cream, it's not hot enough." She complains all the time. I've seen her here too. These three… No, I don't remember. Are you sure, Mr. Joshua? Of course, I am sure. These victims visited your restaurant almost a week before they were murdered. Isn't that strange? Strange? I don't know. Maybe, coincidence is the right word. Coincidence! I like this word, coincidence. Do you know, two such cases coincidentally, happened even in Mhapsa when you were there? Coincidence? Hold on. I hope you are not assuming that… I am the Foot Fairy. I'm sorry. I always imagined that to become a CBI officer, you need to be intelligent, have a high IQ, but… I guess I was wrong. We have information that you have a weird kind of foot fetish. - Oh God! - Would you like to elaborate? If taking extra care of one's feet is called as fetish… Look, I think that… Out of all the body parts in a girl, her feet is the most beautiful. If you want to call it a weird kind of fetish, so… Yes, I have a foot fetish. Look at these dates. Where were you on these dates? I don't eat almonds, so my memory is not that strong. Give me a day, I'll give details for each day. What about those three-four days when you suddenly disappear? That's none of your business. Tell the truth. Or else it will be my business. You understand? I go for trekking. Why? To destroy all the evidence? I… I think you're crossing the line here. Okay? Crossing the line? Is this crossing the line? Please… Please don't do this. Please stop this. - Please stop it. Please… - Is this crossing the line? I'm warning… Oh, God! Do you remember this? This… Please take it away. - Move it, please… - And this, look here. - Take a look. It's your masterpiece. - Please stop it. Please stop it! - Hey, look over here. What's wrong? - Stop it. - It's time for you to leave. - Are you not enjoying now? - Please stop it. - All these are your masterpieces. - You only enjoy while killing them? - Move this away from me. - How do you choose your victims? - Take it away. - You look at their feet, right? - Please stop it. - You must get a sexual high… - Stop it! - …when they struggle to breathe… - Just shut up! - Shut up! - And this is your final trophy! - You saw off their legs and then… - Stop it! - Vivaan… - Mother… Are you out of your mind? You want to hit me? Hit me if you want to! Then see what happens… I am not a poor man! First, find out who I am. And then come and see me. Before that, don't you dare enter my property again. - Okay… - Please leave right now! - Right now! - Vivaan, relax. Please come. Come. What the hell! You should've let me punch the bastard! Punch the bastard! I should also let him sue you, right? We were in his restaurant. And that too, without a warrant. Do you remember what did Mr. Saleem say? One mistake, and it will be over. Didn't you see how he reacted? He is guilty and that's why… In fact, most get scared when they see us. Maybe you are right. But only our suspicion can't send him behind bars. You get it, don't you? We set up a trap to catch an officer accepting bribe, don't we? - Right? - Right. So? Then let's set up a trap. How is that? We'll let loose a target for the hunter. Who will be the prey? There is someone. You'll only do what I have told you to, okay? Don't worry, I am here with my entire team. We'll watch you and you won't be harmed. Like I promised, you will also get 50,000. I'll also help your brother get a job with the Manipur Police. I'll talk to them. Shakhin… Don't you want the Foot Fairy to be caught? What if someone dear to you ends up in his suitcase tomorrow? How will you feel then? We need to display some courage. Come on, let's get this bastard. But sir, why would he attack me? He could've done that already if he wanted to. You don't travel by train, that's why. He knows you go home by bus. He attacks only near the station. Shakhin, listen… Don't worry. You'll be fine. Just do whatever I've told you to. Follow my instructions. Trust me, okay? - Hi. - Hi. - You placed your order? - Yeah. - What are you getting, a burger? - Burger. I'll send you a kitsch. It's really good today. Hey, hi, Shakhin. - Hello. Good, good. - How are you? - How are you? - I'm perfectly fine. You didn't visit the spa for a long time. Not in the city? I was busy with some work. I'll come tomorrow. Okay. Hey! That is a lovely anklet. - Oh! Thank you. - Very pretty! Where did you buy it from? - This one? From Midnight Flea Market. - Okay. Ma'am, here's your order. Thank you. Okay, then see you. - Bye. - Bye. - You live in Bandra East, don't you? - Yes. I'm on my way to Goregaon. Okay. To see a friend. She will pick me from the station. - Traveling by train? - Yes. - Alone? - Yes. - Okay. - Okay. - See you. - Bye. Be careful. Yeah. Very good, Shakhin, very good. Don't be afraid. We are right behind you. Okay? - Okay. - Just stick to the plan. Okay. Rishabh, be ready. - We have already left. - Okay, sir. - Is Hari at the exit? - Yes. Sir, he is leaving. No one follows. I repeat, no one follows. Okay? Let's get this bastard. Remember, be normal. And get off at Goregaon Station. Okay? Goregaon Station. Keep walking. Maybe he is watching you and act normal. Stick to the route I've told you about. Don't worry, I am watching you. Okay? Okay. I'm right behind you. Okay? Shakhin, okay? Shakhin… Shakhin, okay? Shit! Shakhin is with us. - Vivaan. - Yes? Shakhin is at the exit point. With Hari and Rishabh. She is fine. Come. What's the next move? He never came. I don't know. I don't know. He must have suspected something. Did anyone follow her? No. Drop her home and keep a watch. I don't want that bastard getting to her. Okay? Okay. Hari, drop her home. I told you, you'd be fine. Not today, but later… You'll be fine. Now, you're under state protection. Okay? I will send the cash home. I'll also put in a word for your brother's job. Shakhin… Don't worry. Okay? Devika! Vivaan! What happened? Why weren't you answering your phone? The neighbor's son suddenly started vomiting… But what happened? What is it? I was so worried. Vivaan, are you okay? Am I looking fat here? It's a really unique idea to scare me. Very good. But you can't get rid of me so easily. I wish, it was my idea. But it's not. Chill, Vivaan. Maybe a journalist pulled this prank on you. You don't give them an interview or any information. You never know, this must be their way of pissing you off. And, I am not scared of that perv Joshua. Okay? Okay. Good. Maybe the other day he went to your home and so he didn't show up at the station. I don't know. My brain has stopped working. Hari tracked him that night after the raid. Joshua was in his house. He didn't leave the house even for a second. Where is he now? At the restaurant. Did you send those photographs to the lab? Rishabh has sent them. But I doubt if we'll find any prints. Vivaan… A college student is here. He says he might've seen the Foot Fairy. Come. Face? I couldn't see his face clearly. He had put on a cap… The hood of his sweatshirt covered the cap, so… Why do you think he could be the Foot Fairy? Because you said, he wore khaki pants and white sneakers. That's what he was wearing. I even saw him getting out of the station. - And… - And? As he passed by me, I spotted surgical gloves in his back pocket. The fingertips were sticking out. The color of the gloves? Black. San deep. Out of these five, who could be the one you saw? Take your time. Sir, this man. Sure? Well… Sir… It could also be him. I mean, one of these two. Both look similar. It could be any of these two. And what about the other man? He has been in Thane Jail for a year, sir. - Okay. - Yes. So it's enough to order a search warrant and DNA analysis. Yes, sir. Want to interrogate him? No, sir. There's no point. He is too smart and won't confess. Whatever you think is right. But remember one thing, Vivaan. We need evidence with which we can connect this man directly to all the murders. Yes, sir. I know… I'll find something, a murder weapon or something that links him to the murder directly. I will… For sure. I can't give you more time, Vivaan. Joshua's lawyer can sue us for defamation. And then, you know the media will tear us apart. Give up on him, look for other suspects. One second. Yeah. Okay, thanks. That was the lab. The inscription on the body doesn't match with Joshua's handwriting. One more thing. The Foot Fairy is right-handed and Joshua is left-handed. Many people are ambidextrous. Shut up! Can I ask you something? You were never that passionate about any other suspect. Only Joshua. Why? You really think he is the Foot Fairy? Or you want him to be? Just to feel less stressful? You know… More than any research, I trust my gut feeling. It tells me Joshua is the Foot Fairy. I can't explain, but I find something strange in his eyes that I can't describe. Once I understand that… Then… And God forbid, What if you are wrong? There's no chance. I am sure it's him. I will have that bastard in custody before… Before he harms me? Don't you worry, Mr. Vivaan Deshmukh. And don't forget, I am an Army child. See these manicured nails? If that perv comes any closer, I will scratch his face off! Got it? Got it. Good. Now, smile. Coffee? Should we talk to Mr. Saleem about police protection for Devika? No, you know she wouldn't agree. We spoke yesterday. She says if she sees that joker anywhere around her… She will scratch his… What happened? Vivaan! Will you tell me what's wrong? When we raided Joshua's house, he was in his boxer shorts. - So? - There were scratches on his hands. I'm sure, they're nail scratches. The victim would have scratched him in self–defense. Yes, but we have already checked. Nothing was found under any of the nails. And the victims who were handled by the cops before us? The second victim Seema Bimal… There's nothing about her nails in the report. Maybe she scratched him? Maybe she didn't. That's why there is no mention of it in the report. But still, it's a protocol, Harsh. What if this is the mistake we have made? Yes. Dr. Bhogle… I'd like some information about a case. Did the lab confirm that there could be a lapse? Yes, sir and that's why we need to exhume the body to test it again. Sir… Sir, please… I really need this to catch him. Need? No, Vivaan. You don't need this. You want this. Final DNA results will be ready by the day after tomorrow. Yes, sir. If Joshua's skin tissues match with those found under the nails… No ifs and buts, they will match. Okay. He's under bumper lock surveillance, isn't he? Yes. I've also sent a restraining order. He can't leave Mumbai till the results are out. Good. Mr Saleem… Thanks for trusting me. Let me ask Hari. - Hari… - Yes, sir? What's the status? He is at home, sir. Okay. What happened at the office? You're wearing a new shirt today? Sir, don't make fun of me… You're looking handsome today. I am here… Hello. Yeah, Rishabh? Sir. The railway police had called. Sir, gloves… Sir! Sir! Yes, Rishabh. Shit! She was only 15. Why her? It's not your pattern. You did it only to exact revenge upon me, right? I am going to kill you, you bastard! You know what? It will make no difference to anyone if you die. Tell me. Didn't you kill her? Tell me the truth. Didn't you kill her? Yes. I killed her. I killed them all. All those girls. Is that what you want to hear? Stop! Are you out of your mind? Control yourself. Just watch what I do with you. Arrest the bastard! Harsh, arrest the bastard! DNA result. It's a mistake. This report is wrong. Get it checked again. Vivaan, get a grip. Control yourself. At least, the end was peaceful. I guess so. - Is the family okay? - Yes. They're not in shock. I guess, they were expecting it. They were prepared. Anyway, say hi to Harsh. Sure, I will. Listen, I'll call you from the airport. Okay? Okay. Safe flight. Okay, bye. Bye. Bye. How is Bengaluru? Looks like, it's treating you well. Not really. How is your security company doing? It's good. You tell me. What's going on in your life? What about me? It's the same. Only the governments change. Our work doesn't. What about Rishabh? Russia. A special assignment. Hmm. And Joshua? Any news about Joshua? I don't know. He must be somewhere. LSB has shut shop and a new joint has taken its place. I don't know the rest. - Vivaan… - Yes? I wanted to say something for a long time. But I never got a chance. I could neither muster the courage to tell you this. Tell me. I hope you didn't feel that I backed out at the last minute. You know, when you resigned, I should've resigned too. Don't be stupid, Harsh. You know, I didn't want to resign. But I had no choice. Joshua's defamation case. Mr. Saleem had no option. Since I was heading this investigation. It had to be me. My only regret is… That the case was closed. Forget it. - See you soon. - Sure. Please pull over to the left. The Foot Fairy Case will always be a successful failure for me. Successful because we stopped the killings. But a failure because we couldn't catch him. Mister! What are you looking at? Nothing, just looking. You too? What do you mean? Some time ago, a man like you was standing here. He was looking over there. I asked him the same question. So what did he say? He told me, he had kept a red suitcase over there. Many years ago. He came to check on that. Did you see his face? What did he look like? Like you, like any other middle-aged man. And where did he go? The darkness will creep up behind you To sting. Time will outrun you The morning is still far away. Only darkness shall stand by you Till the end. Accidents lurk at every step. Waiting to pounce on you. They'll latch onto you. Even if you try to get away. Darkness! Time will outrun you The morning is still far away. See the blind vortex of dreams. And the rising smoke That pricks your eyes. Everyone will be destroyed. Oh this killer darkness! At every step. Subtitled by Saurabh R Sawant
