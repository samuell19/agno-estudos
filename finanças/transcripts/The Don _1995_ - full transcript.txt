Minister, what are you thinking in solitude? Bhujang, one political move is to,... move slyly and take the lion"s share. You've taught him the ropes. Look, l"m an illiterate. All these things are beyond my comprehension. And l can"t act until l don"t understand it. Just tell me as to whose murder l have to commit. Who the hell is it? And why are you massacring my house? l"m coming! Why are you giving a gun-shot salute to a non-government man like me? l can"t see anything in this bright light. Who are you, big brother? Mr Deva, you? - Touch his feet. - Salutations! Your aura blinded my eyes. When the sun comes closer things become more clearer. Big brother, pardon me if l've done something. But why are you creating darkness for me? To remind you of a long forgotten dark night,..... which was darker than this. l was also there and so were you. We both were framed in a murder. This is a conspiracy to break our unity. Listen to me carefully,... this mill belongs to us, laborers. Did you recollect? That union leader? But that is around 15 years ago. This is as fresh to me as tomorrows news. Bhujang, l want the name of the man,... who employed me to kill that union leader. The one who gave you the contract to kill prashant Kapre,... was the one who hired me to create discord in the meeting. Bhandari did n"t tell me anything more than this. l swear. if you really don"t know anything then you will come to no harm. But if you are hiding anything from me then beware! You and your henchmen will pay with your lives for it. He"s learnt the ropes very well. Shut up! Who was it? - Why did he come here? - He"s looking for prashant Kapre"s killer. l did n"t disclose your name. l, Bhandari, am always true to my word, so rest assured. l told you your goods will reach on time. Who are you all? - Devendra, you? - Not Devendra but Deva. Devendra died the day,... in desperation he came to you. And today Deva has come to you after fighting all odds. l know you have become the king of the underworld. A child may be unaware of the Governor"s name,... but every child knows Deva"s name. But l've come to ask you of one name. - Whose? - Who was the man,... who through you got me to kill prashant Kapre? Bhandari, you are still alive,... then why the death like silence? Give me his name or people will forget your name also. Why only his name? l"ll give you his address and picture also. l"ll pardon this mistake of yours,... if you give me that man"s name. Come on, tell me. Mr Deva, many people were involved in the conspiracy to kill prashant. But it was all hatched by one man. And his name is,.... Mr Deva, l"ll tell you everything. l"m not so desperate also to use cowards like you to reach my goals. if you don"t want to lead a dumb person"s life,... then pretend to be blind. - Who called up the police? - l, sir. Who killed him? ""The one who combats hurricanes,... and comes like a cyclone,... the one who perishes evil from this earth,... ""He makes his own rules and his word is law here"". ""He rules over every heart and is the undisputed king"". ""He is the strength of the weak"". ""Tell me who is he"". ""A messiah has come,... to spread the message of love"". ""He"ll bring warring hearts closer and change the course of the world"". ""He"ll remove thorns to pave the path with roses"". ""Tell me who is he?"" Sir, why did you want to meet me in this deserted place? Mr Deva, a man is trying to create problems in my business and factory. What is his name? - What does he do? - He"s my factory"s union leader. My gun abides by a law. The bullet has permission to hit only the guilty. l accept this money,.... from the workers,... as the money to kill you. What?! Sir, did you send for me? You"ave been looking for this man since four years,... but are yet clueless. Eighteen years ago he looked something like this. His appearance might have changed with the passage of time. if he wears spectacles,... then probably he must be looking like this. if he has grown a beard then he must be looking something like this. You are a private detective. And it is your profession to catch a hint. l want this man"s whereabouts at all costs. Be careful lest my limbs get fractured. Why are you roaming like a freebie? l"ave warned you to behave like a girl. That"s why l"m asking you to hug me, Rajaram. l don"t want to kill myself by hugging you. - And what are you of the girl"s hostel? - l"m the warden. if the warden is so lovesick what will happen to the girls? Look down, feel embarrassed and turn around. What lovely poetry! All this is due to your beauty. My poetry is anxious to touch your beauty. Then recite one more couplet. You said it and l recited it! - it's absolutely fresh. - Then recite it. "Life is a beautiful journey,... who knows what will happen next?" What a lovely essence of life! it"s so fresh and with so much depth. Only you can gauge the depth of my thoughts. They are romancing. l will put an end to it. professor Raghav, leave everything aside,... and come immediately to the principal"s office. He is a real spoil sport. Go, perhaps he has some important work. When he himself is not important, how can his work be important? That reminds me of a couplet. "Love was facing problems,... - please go. - Alright, if you insist. Whatever it is but he is the principal. l wonder how such nuisances are born! You really enjoy hearing your voice on the loudspeaker! Why did you call me? it"s come to my notice that a hamlet is built on our land in pune. Go and check it. How did you get this news? Anyway, l"ll go on Sunday. l can"t go now. - l left class to come here. - l know all about your classes. You are so besotted by that lecturer,... that you aren't bothered of your ancestral property also. My ancestors were not bothered about me either. Or why would they leave you for me? - l"ll go. - Go! Now l"ll show that lecturer Dulari. You did wear a beard like your brother,... but will you go in a suit to meet her? Oh no! "Life without you is so blind". "Only dust is remaining". "l"m lost without you". "l"ave been shaking like a leaf". You infer it, l"ll soon be back. How long do l"ave to sit with this beard? Why were you in such a haste? l"ave left the class incomplete. Don"t you know that the students tease me with your name? Yet you came and stood outside my class! Sit first. "Norms are such. What are you!" "The best of us get maligned". Lovely! ls it a new one? Yes, l wrote it when l was waiting for you. You seem to be in a great mood. You will go crazy if l tell you another fresh one. - Then recite it. - Shall l? Leave me or l"ll tell the principal. Damn this beard! l nearly got caught. Sir, l"ave come to you with a small complaint. - What is it? - Sir, your brother Mr Raghav,... called me to the terrace and treated me shabbily. l was terribly embarrassed. How dare he? Was he really offensive? l apologize on behalf of my brother. l.. l mean he shouldn't have done that. But you seem to be a nice girl, how come you got taken in by him? - l don"t know, sir. - You ought to be more sensible. Forget him. What"s so special about him anyway? Cast a glance towards me also. l love you very much. - What is this you are doing? - Give me a chance at least. ls your entire family so bad? l was only saying that he should n"t have behaved so bad. What a girl has come to our college! - ls it? - She stays in the hostel. She is amazing! The college has brightened after her arrival. Don"t praise so much. if you fall in love,... you will have to work double. Along with studies you"ll have to study her also. She is beautiful and she knows she is beautiful. You can"t ensnare her. What a melodious whistle! Will you also teach me whistling? Certainly! How was the sound of this tabla? Next time don"t you dare to whistle at me. Understand? ""l"m a lover boy, O my dear"". ""l"m crazily in love with her but she does n"t realize"". ""The weather is so romantic, come into my arms"". ""Don"t torment me further"". ""O my beauty, don"t walk with a sway"". ""Or l might die here itself"". ""Don"t break my heart"". ""And kiss my cheeks"". ""l am your eternal lover". ""O beauty, you"ave stolen my heart"". ""l will also steal your heart"". ""l promise to make you mine"". ""Look into eyes and don"t torment me further"". Hey you peon, go and call vijay. - Who me? - Yes you? Are you some king? vijay, that Hitler is calling you. - Who? - Your headmaster. Address him as principal, Mr Rajaram. He"s got no principles to be addressed as a principal. l am the principal of this college and l"ave a right to question everyone. And l"m asking you what is happening in this college? Why are the boys behaving like Romeos and the girls like Juliet's? Raghupati, they are after all children, let them enjoy. And what about the professors who are equally lovesick? Raghav, it does n"t befit you to flirt with Dulari at this age. We brothers are triplets,... you are in a better position,... but you are jealous as you have nobody to love you. Damn you! Look, concentrate more on studies than on other activities. - Sir, you sent for me? - Yes, l wanted your advise. - Mine? - There"s already singing going on in college. So, what"s the use of studies. Let"s stop it. How about converting it into a dancing school? vijay, because of you not only students,... but lecturers and peon are also getting spoil t. it won"t happen again. if anything happens after this l"ll pull your ears and rusticate you. Listen,... did you strike a friendship with the new admission? You? vijay, who is it? ""l"m crazy about him but he does n"t know it"". ""Everyone but he knows that l"m crazy about him"". ""Tell him this malady is very old"". ""He is a confirmed Romeo"". Stop this song and dance! What is all this and who are you all? Aunt y, my name is Anita and they all are my friends. We are vijay"s classmates. vijay was absent for fifteen days, so,.. - What nonsense are you talking, Anita? - Don"t worry, vijay,... a mother forgives all mistakes. - That girl also forgave you. - Girl? Which girl? Aunt y, don"t admonish him. Actually he teased a girl. She threatened to complain to the principal so he got scared. perhaps that"s why he does n"t attend college. - ls it so, vijay? - But don"t worry you can now attend college. l explained her and she did n"t complain. So you go to college to have fun and not to study? - Mother, she is,.. - Fun reminds me that,.... your that lousy wayward friend had come to meet you. - Who? - The one with whom you make fake certificates and mark-sheets. What? Fake mark-sheets? Yes, aunt y, they don"t study and then resort to all this. We"ll go now. vijay, do come to college tomorrow. The college seems empty without your antics. So all your certificates and mark-sheets are fake? Mother, those girls were joking. Did they come here to joke? it"s good my eyes opened. Today l"ll burn all those certificates. Mother, listen to me! l know with what difficulty l"ave been making two ends meet. So that he can have a good life. But he"s just not bothered about me. in college,... l"ll wait for your call. Any information? Sir, the description you gave,... matches Minister parshuram"s brother prajapati,... who settled in America some sixteen years ago. Changing nations does n"t alter the date of your death. Any information about him in America? Sir, it can be tracked. But you may not need it because he"s coming back to this city. He"s lucky. Had he died abroad his body would be buried. Here his death may be bad,... but at least he will get a decent funeral. l must get to know immediately of his arrival in this city. Welcome, Mr Bhujang! please take a seat. What brings you here? l need five seats in your college. One for my son and the rest for his friends. The admission closed four months ago. - Sir, it is not possible. - What did you say? l"ll reverse September back to June. Either give me five seats or accept six bullets in your chest. Now l"ll study here. Come on, out. l want the library empty. l"ll study here. Are you deaf? Where are you going? l came here for you. We have to study the lesson of love together. You changed your college to get rid of me. But see, l followed you here also. it means l am your true admirer. Listen carefully, you beauty,... if you fall for anyone besides me,... you will be killed. it is a sin to love secretly. l openly admit to my love for you, my dear. Shut up! Are you mad? Why can"t you pick on someone else? Don"t you love me? You are too huge to fit into my heart. He is romancing. peon Rajaram, wherever you are please come to the principal"s office. So he saw? l"ave warned you several times from chasing me. He gets jealous. principal, l"m coming. - Aren't you ashamed? - l am. - Lower your eyes. - Alright. - Turn around. - Okay. What shall l do now, my beloved? Why did you call me? Tell me. l"m the principal, can"t l summon the peon? You have special timings to send for me. l understand everything. Anyway, what work did you have? Go and see if the post-office is open? Just think once at least before issuing orders. Why will the post-office be shut when this college is open? Don"t use your brains. That is my job. Just go and check if the post-office is open or no. l"ave to post some letters. - And move fast. - The day l move, you"ll become history. - What? - Give me the letters, l"ll post it if it"s open. Just do as much as you are asked to do. See if it"s open, come back, take the letters,... and then post the letters. Raghupati, you"ave troubled me a lot. Then go change your destiny to mine. Now, go and do as you are told. - immediately! - Going! Don"t throw your weight! Everyone besides me is having fun. Now this Rajaram will flirt with that fatso. - You'd have run me down. - Today you"ave made me very happy. What"s the matter? Why were you calling me like this? Just like that. You"ave flicked it off the principal, is n"t it? - How could l make this mistake? - What did you say? l never felt like romancing in that uniform. l feel so vibrant in this. Then make me also vibrant, Raja. - Not here. - Not here? - This place is too small for that. - ls it? l"ll take you to a place where only we are there not the man in uniform. - Man in uniform? - What am l saying? - l mean where l don"t remember the uniform. - Oh! - So, shall we leave? - Yes. Link your arm to mine. Why does this happen to me? This...that.... You again blocked my path? Because of you l had to go to the post-office. Move aside! You were here now and now you are coming from there! How? - Are you a magician? - Ask the principal about me. He"ll tell you that l"m a peon. Raja, don"t play such pranks on me or l"ll go mad. You wore a suit and were making romantic talks,... and were taking me for a date. And now you are coming from ahead. - Suit and l? - Yes. Madam, when l was born l was this small and was nude. The first cloth the nurse put on me was khaki in color. As l grew older the cloth also grew. And then it became this uniform. l"ave never ever worn a suit. Understood? Anita, look, l"ave come to college. You pacified the girl l teased, is n"t it? Now let me tease you also. l"m sure you won"t complain to the principal. vijay, that was just a joke. l too will play an expensive joke on you. Then you will understand the meaning of jokes. vijay, don"t do something wrong. l"ll do something wrong only. vijay, look, don"t touch me. Go, l forgive you. Wow! What a scene! What a unique way to do publicity. Look at this new style to romance. - What"s on your back? - How does it concern you? it does concern me. Who is vijay? - Have you gone mad? - it"s you who has gone mad. This....vijay. - Who is he? - it is me! - You stuck this on her back? - Yes. - Did you write it? - Yes. l"ll kill you! What are you both upto? You come here to study or to fight? So this is the color of my blood? l"ave never before seen my blood flowing. That wretch has showed me the color of my blood. Now what l show him will be something he"ll never forget all his life. ""The moment l saw you my heart started racing"". ""O my dear, l"m hopelessly in love with you"". ""it was love at first sight for me"". ""You are in my eyes"". ""You adorn my heart"". ""You are a part of my dreams"". ""And in every breath l take"". ""l just have to peep into my heart to see you."" ""My beloved is angry with me"". ""Forgive me please"". ""How long will you remain angry with me?"" ""Calm down, please"". ""Life without you is like hell"". What insolence is this! ls this any way to enter? A boy called vijay is studying in your college. Expel him from college tomorrow itself. Why and who are you to order me around? Are you the education minister or his father-in-law? l once gave you five seats in this college,... so you consider this college as your domain? Talking too much is bad for your health. if that boy is seen in the college from tomorrow,... then you won"t be seen in this world. What are you saying? Are you a man or a weapon? You only talk about destruction. Think rationally, if l expel him from college,... won"t it ruin his life? And if you won"t expel him,... than l"ll ruin the lives of all of you three brothers. Hey you, whom are you trying to threaten? We are not cowards. - You want to see my courage? - Yes. - Slowly. - Shut up, you coward! What if he really kills you! Down with the management! Take back vijay! Take back vijay! Damn the principal! Did you see the result of your vendetta? Can you hear these slogans? Tomorrows papers will slander the college"s reputation. l"ll have to take back vijay to appease the students. Damn you! You"ave ruined my language also. Let them raise their voice. My boys will come and silence them. Hit them! Stop them! You think you are a big time goon to show guns to these students? Ask the principal about me. What pressure tactics are you imposing on the children? Ask them to stop or there will be riots. it is my profession to create riots. - But this will harm the children. - The slogan shouting has stopped. Can you hear the silence? Even the breeze takes my permission to blow so,... Big brother! it"s good you stood up on your own. Now turn around and move out of this college. Why are you looking at me? Come on, go! And take away your son also. l"ave expelled him from college. He was trying to teach me what to do. As you please, Big brother. Son, we have to obey his orders. You came at the right time. This man wanted me to comply with his wishes at gun point. principal, those who show the gun,... they don"t often use it. There is more iron in a ordinary man"s arms,... than in the guns of such cowards. You are right. l too had become a coward. - Minister? - Bhujang? Yes? All this while you spoke and l followed all your instructions. And this Bhujang is very useful to you. Don"t you agree with me, Minister? Come to the point. l want to finish a college boy. You kill game animals, so since when have you started hunting birds? But this bird is riding on a lion"s back? Which lion? He has become that college boy"s shield. it has become imperative to finish off that boy. Deva recognizes all my men. So we have to get this work done by someone,... whom Deva does n"t know about. Don"t worry, that man will meet you tomorrow. Explain him the work and your work will be done tomorrow itself. ""Your love drives me insane"". ""l"ave become a stranger to everyone"". ""There is none like you"". ""l can"t live without you, O my dear"". ""Your love drives me insane"". ""l"ave become a stranger to everyone"". ""There is none like you"". ""l can"t live without you, O my dear"". ""l"ave never seen anyone quite like you"". ""You are much more beautiful that what l'd imagined"". ""You are the need of my restless heart"". ""You are my life, my love"". ""My heart beats for you"". ""Write love everywhere"". ""There is romance in the air also"". ""Tell me something sweet"". Well done, vijay! Hurry up! Doctor, if you want to be where you are then a patient is being admitted. - Don"t admit that patient. - But who are you? Mr Bhujang, you? Why, did my name send shivers down your spine? if you don"t obey my orders, you will remain in the hospital,... but not as a doctor, but as a patient. - l get it. - He"s a college boy,... and will be coming with a knife wound. Send him away. Do you get me? - Yes, sir. He won"t be admitted. - Okay. Save his life or he"ll die. What can l do? Why did you bring him in? When there are no empty beds, how can you admit him? - Leave him to the ambulance. - He won"t go anywhere. - He"ll be treated here. - What are you doing, doctor? Where can we take him in this serious condition? That is not my problem. Doctor, at least check him up. - And until the police comes,... - Damn your police! instead of treating the patient, you are teaching us the rules. Will you treat him or no? What happened to my child? - Doctor, please save my child. - if he"s kept here, he"ll die. Don"t you have a child? Can"t you understand a mother"s pain? - Leave me. - You are a brute not a doctor. Animal! Monster! Nobody will touch him. That woman"s tears were Deva"s That boy"s blood was Deva"s blood. if anything happens to him, l"ll pump so much explosives in you,... that you will burn all your life. Understood? l beg you to please attend to him or he"ll die. l"m helpless. You have still not admitted this patient. it is so shameful. Doctors, nurses, come to the ICU immediately. How come a brute went in and a man came out? His father is here! Mother, open your eyes. vijay"s been admitted. The doctors have taken him in. How did all this happen? vijay was coming towards the college,... when a man came from the front and knifed him and ran away. - Did anyone see him? - Yes, l saw him. - Can you identify him? - l can recognize him anywhere. Stop! Bikers, do you take my house to be some highway? Stop them! Stop! Which team do you belong to? Big Brother, why are you having this motorbike rally in my house? Bhujang, did n"t l warn you,... not to provoke me. Big Brother, you can raise my house down,... - but at least tell me my fault? - Attack on vijay. That college student? l"m not a fool to attack that vijay who enjoys your patronage. Believe me, l"ave nothing to do,... with that college. l"ave an eye-witness to that incident. Ask your men to stand in a queue. Come on, get up and stand in a queue in front of Big Brother. - Mr Rajaram! - Yes, sir? Was it one of these? No, sir. Bhujang, if l came to know that you"re involved in this attack,... then today at least you"d have an easy death,.... because in my books delayed punishment,... is more severe. Aunt y, don"t worry. The doctor said that he"ll be fine. There"s nothing to worry. l"ll let you know. l"ll call back later. Mr Deva, vijay is much better now. - Keep this. - This was not necessary. - How long will he have to be here? - The wound is still raw. He can"t move around for 10-15 days. What is this Deva doing here? He is an angel. - it was because of him that you were saved. - Because of him? l don"t want to get myself treated. Some sins are unpardonable. And even one lifetime is not sufficient,... for some sins. Doctor, hurry up. Be careful, the wound is still raw. Mr Deva, l"m Rajaram calling. l can show you the man who knifed vijay. - Where is he? - ls a television close to you? - Yes, it is. - Switch it on. Just see minister parshuram"s speech. What did we give to our future generations? Only corruption and violence. Today everyone is selfish. On which side of parshuram is he? Can you see that bald man behind the minister? He"s the one. Today man has become alone in every fight of his. The country"s strength has been divided,... into as many parts as the population. Today we"ave become so weak that anyone can come and,... malign us. instead of facing criminals bravely we fear them. And that is the reason for the mushrooming,... of these anti social elements everywhere. They dominate the law and order situation. These goons,.... on the basis of muscle power want to disturb the common man"s life. Deva has come for you, you better slip away. So l was saying that the government is helpless against them. You have to fight this battle yourself. Has n"t your thirst for blood quenched yet? Or are your intentions still evil? Sister, think before you talk. - You don't know who he is? - Who would know him better than me? He is my husband"s murderer! Commissioner, what brings you here? l came to warn you. put an end to your crimes,... or l"ll destroy your world of crime. Those who are themselves finished,... don"t threaten to finish them, Commissioner. You"ave been recently transferred. And so are unaware of the norms of this city. I have not been transferred, but I have asked for a bank transfer. Thank your stars that l did n"t get an arrest warrant for you. Because l"m sure that it was you who killed Jagga. Then why are you delaying in arresting me? Because criminals like you know,... that the court does n"t accept only the police"s statement. And fear for you has silenced people. Commissioner, l really feel sorry at your helplessness. You have the bullets but not the gun! But don"t worry,... l"ave confidence in my honesty. Hereafter, l"ll be keeping a vigil on your crimes. if you try to come close to an inferno called Deva,... to collect evidences,... you will burn your hands. Those who have the spirit of martyrdom,... don"t bother for such things. Just try and commit one more crime,... and l"ll put you behind bars. l will commit at least one more crime. And all your ploys will fail. But after l commit that one last crime,... you won"t have to get into the hassles of evidences and witnesses. Because that day l, Deva, will be the guilty,... and the witness too. l"ll only commit the crime and l"ll only decide the punishment. l"ll only put the noose around my neck and l"ll only be the hang man. Bhujang, make preparations for Deva"s doom. Deva"s doom is not very difficult for you to bring about, Minister. Bury Deva"s rule under the power of your position. l am not so weak,... that l"ave to use my position for all these odd jobs. Deva is also not some ordinary bird,... who will fly away if you scream at him. He is like the vulture who preys on the dead. My experience says it"s better to bid our time,... then get hasty and fall flat on our faces. - What do you mean? - Make a dent in his fortress. When Deva killed Jagga in the market,... vijay"s mother was present there. And she accused him,... of being her husband"s murderer. if Deva is vijay"s father"s killer,.... then why is he so protective about him? This is what even l am compelled to think. They do share a legitimate or illegitimate relationship. And if we get to know about it,... we can use it to our advantage. prashant was my ideal. When he was killed, l wasn't here or else,... l"d have seen to it that his killer was duly punished. How many years did the law punish the killer for? For 1 4-15 years and after which he"s now become the mafia don Deva. But there are rumors that he is molding vijay to his style. Look, l know vijay better than anyone else. Since childhood l"ave fed vijay to hate Deva. Then why does Deva interfere so much in vijay"s matters? perhaps he"s atoning. So the Minister has reached vijay"s house. He could n"t digest Jagga"s death,... so he is using the hamlet,... to reach me. Minister, your manipulations are beyond my comprehension. Just tell me if you could find out about their relationship or no? They share a relationship of hate. l think if we put vijay and his mother at gun point,... Deva will come groveling at my feet. Then why are you delaying? The stage is set. play your moves and make them the sacrificial lambs. Here! - Brother! - Bless you! This trip abroad was a torture for me. l"m coming after sixteen years. l feel l"ave been released from jail. Your exile was really very long. Now you will rule this city. Come. After you! - Why did you block the road? Move. - The vehicle stopped, sir. prajapati, did you recognize me? No. Who are you? - Did you remember anything now? - Sorry, but no. Do you remember Bhandari or did you forget even that? That poultry fellow? Oh yes, l remember. Aren't you his man Devendra? Tell me why did you make me kill prashant Kapre? Believe me, l was not responsible for it. - Then who wanted to kill him? - Brother, tell him. Only Bhandari knows. Then l"ll send you to Bhandari. What nonsense is this? How dare you threaten to kill my brother in broad daylight? You may be the don of this city. l am also a politician. This in my presence! Minister, unlike you l play straight and don"t manipulate. prajapati, l give you twenty-four hours time. if you want to live, come and tell me that man"s name. Or you will not live long. And you know how maligned l am. And l do what l say. - You should n"t have come back. - Why? The way Deva blocked your path does n"t foretell good. it"s like the city"s biggest danger is looming on your head. l"ave been getting threatening calls. post some police constables outside my house. - You still haven"t unpacked? - if l unpack and stay here,... l"ll be dead. Why do you get scared at the slightest provocation? Did you come back an impotent from abroad? Look at the way you are roaring here. But you were speechless in front of Deva. in politics, silence is also is used as a weapon. You were tongue tied and are making excuses now. I was quiet for you or I would have done it told him the truth. - Then go and give him my name. - You know l can"t do that. if l give your name he"ll kill you, if l don"t he"ll kill me. He"s given twenty-four hours. Brother, hide me in a safe place. l don"t want to die now. Shut up! l think it"s best if you go abroad. if you see Deva again, you will melt like a candle. Go to Delhi. l"ll get your visa done in a day or two. Your boarding card. Your luggage has been checked in. Father, vijay and l study in the same college. - And we,... - l get it, my child. Your father"s eyes gauged the rest. Did you find only him in the entire college to introduce me to? Child, l too was young once. He"s nice. l liked him. Son, l"m proud of my daughter"s choice. - When will the plane take off? - in a short while. But it"s already time. What is it? Get in. Sweet? She scared me. Sir, is there a bomb in this plane? - You look very scared? - No, l"m fine. - ls this your first flight? - No, it"s my last flight. Now you can never cause me any harm. What?! - Don"t move! - Who are you? We are sorry to inform that due to a technical snag in the plane,... we have to again land at the Bombay Airport. passengers are requested to fasten their seat belts. But why do we have to get off here? Everything will be fine. it"s good the technical snag was realized here. That could have been resolved in Delhi also. Why here? passengers are requested to be seated in their seats. Nobody will move. What is this? l want to go to Delhi. Where are you taking me? Leave me. please! Try to understand. Deva, forgive me. l want to go to Delhi. l"m innocent. How come the mouse mustered courage to block the lion"s way? l"m a wild ox not a mouse. And when a wild ox blocks the lion"s path,... even the lion scampers away. But this time this wild ox will not even give you a chance to scamper. l"ll cut you into more pieces than you did of my brother"s body. parshuram, a leopard does n"t change its spots. Listen,... if you know the secret to find which your brother was killed,... then let me know. And if you knowingly keep it from me,.... then your state will be worse than your brother"s also. Deva, it is you who will meet with a bad fate. Just turn around and see. l"ave never learnt to look back. l can estimate my enemy"s ploys much in advance. Those who burn their hands with the flame of a match-stick,... should n"t play with fire. Next time when you come to fight me,... wipe the tears from your eyes. Or you won"t know when l came and finished you off. Officers, l want all information, big or small... about mafia don Deva. Sir, there is no report against him in any police station. Do you mean he became the don without committing any crimes? Sir, he has committed crimes. Like prajapati"s murder case has been lodged,.... but Deva"s name is neither given,... nor is there any evidence or witness against him. Sir, AC p patil wants to meet you. Send him in. - Yes. - This is the first time,... an officer like you has stood his ground against Deva. This is a matter of pride for our department. But the ground you are standing on is the government"s. And so is this uniform,... and the bullets in our pistols. Whom are you hinting at? At a handful of government employees who are bigger criminals than Deva. And are holding high ranks. To know the truth you have to open the file of Deva"s first crime. But be careful. Because that file is like a lamp,... and a genie comes out of it. That will send you elsewhere to do your duty. The government knows about me. l"ave a reputation of being,... a very honest man. l will open that file but after,... l make certain officers understand their duty. Find out if eighteen years ago,... there was a poultry farm on the Bombay-pune highway. And the owner was some Bhandari. And who was killed a few years ago. Commissioner, you are raking old wounds? it"s been eighteen days since my brother was killed. And you are digging an eighteen year old file! in a city where the living people don"t testify,.. l"ave start my investigation from the dead"s testification. Why do you need to investigate,... when you yourself have been an eye witness? Why don"t you arrest him? if l arrest him on the basis of my witness,... the guilty will be acquitted. Because the court does n"t accept a police officer"s testification. We"ll see all that later. First you arrest my brother"s killer Deva. The confidence with which you accuse Deva of killing your brother,... why did n"t you lodge a complaint against him? Why? To increase the quantity of files? Already a number of complaints are buried in these files. Do you want to bury my brother"s murder case also in these files? These files are not rotting. These files bear the story of criminals which we use to get clues. And l"ll prove it to you with this file that,... l"ll get the motive behind Deva killing prajapati from his first crime. And l may also get reason,... for your hesitation in lodging a complaint against him. it is you who are hesitating to arrest Deva. And how can you arrest him,... when your entire department is corrupt. And you too are a pawn in his hands. - This is a lie. - This is the fact. You are Deva"s man and it"s on his behest that you were transferred here. This is a lie. At least this is true that your daughter loves a boy called vijay? Yes. And that vijay has a legitimate or illegitimate relation with Deva? You find it hard to believe, is n"t it? Commissioner, forget about my brother"s killer,.... but go and investigate about your daughter"s love life. principal, does vijay has a legal or illegitimate relation with Deva? All relations are legitimate. it"s circumstances that makes them illegitimate. Don"t try to cover up the guilt. And accept it that vijay is Deva"s illegitimate child. Commissioner, l"m terribly hurt to hear such things,... from a decent man like you. vijay is the legitimate son of his father prashant Kapre. And Deva is vijay"s legitimate maternal uncle. All of a sudden why are you against vijay? You liked him, father, is n"t it? While extolling his good qualities you forgot to state one fact,... that he is the nephew of the mafia don Deva. He did n"t choose this relationship of his choice. So how can you blame him for this? Then it is your fault,.... that you are the daughter of Commissioner of police Malik. And you know that this Commissioner, that is your father,... can sacrifice anything for his duty. Even his daughter! - vijay, where are you going? - Anita did n"t attend college today? Hereafter she won"t attend college and you also don"t try to meet her. - But why? - You will get the answer from Deva. Deva has no connection with me, uncle. He is your maternal uncle. it"s good that l got to know it now. Or I had married my daughter to you. And become a puppet in Deva"s hands. Get out of here! And if l see you anywhere near this house,... you will be insulted very badly. ""if l listen to my heart the world becomes my enemy"". ""And if listen to the world, l"ll lose my life". ""Neither my heart obeys me nor does the world understands"". ""if l listen to my heart the world becomes my enemy"". ""And if listen to the world, l"ll lose my life". ""Neither my heart obeys me nor does the world understands"". ""My eyes are only looking for the,.... moments l spent with you"". ""The place where we always met,... has become so desolate"". ""How can l live without you?"" ""Consider this"". ""Your meeting me and then parting,... will always torture me"". ""in your separation,... my heart will shed tears of blood"". ""This pain of separation,... will kill me, my dear"". ""These orthodox customs,... have become a barrier to our love"". ""How can you love,... when love is made to be conditional""? ""l"ll honor my commitment to you,... and bear everything that comes my way"". When you failed to use your clout on the common man,... you used it on your daughter. Deva, one day you will have to see my power. But until vijay"s name is linked to your family,... Anita won"t have anything to do with him. As long vijay and Anita love each other,... then forget the Commissioner of police,... but even the country"s police also tries to separate them,... then Deva will not allow that to happen. Commissioner, take this as my advise and reconsider your decision. if this becomes my challenge,... then it will prove to be difficult for you. l plead with you to stop interfering in my life. Whatever Anita and my love has to suffer, we will suffer. But don"t malign our love by using your pressure tactics. Your brutishness killed my father. And my mother will pay for being your sister all her life. Shut up! You said she has paid for being my sister, is n"t it? Then listen how her brother had to pay with his flesh and blood? Today you will have to hear this fact from her brother. Come! Sit. Your father did die at my hands. But l did n"t know that he was your father. Deep ti never hid anything from me. But she did n"t inform me,... when she fell in love with prashant Kapre. l was very hurt the day,... she told me that,... Brother, we"ave been married. - What did you say? - Brother, please forgive me. We were helpless. prashant"s parents wanted to get him married elsewhere. So we got married in a temple with god as witness. Will god come down to earth and testify? Whom all will l convince that you have got married? You"ave created a big problem for me. Brother, kill me. l"ave betrayed your trust in me. Overcome by emotions, l forgot,... that my brother is not only my brother,..... but he is a mother and father to me. in the eyes of the world you are still a maiden. They will not accept your marriage,... until and unless you leave this house after completing the rituals. But don"t worry, l take the responsibility of your marriage. invite prashant home tomorrow to finalize the marriage date. We are already married. We just have to perform the rituals in front of the world. So we"ll do it whenever brother wants us to do it. l wanted you to meet brother once. - l"ave met brother Devendra. - When? ls n"t he brother Devendra? He"s an angel. Tell your angelic brother not to get worked up. Just to make all the arrangements. - What? Five thousand rupees?? - Yes. You should"ave at least thought it once before asking. Sir, l need the money badly. Did l ever stop your wages even if l had a problem? if l consider everyone"s problems, who will pay the wages? Sir, if l can"t arrange the money my sister"s marriage will get stalled. it will be a big insult. Then find a boss who believes in giving advance. l"ll get another driver. Why are you wasting your time? He never gives money when it"s not due. Nathu, you tell the boss, he may listen to you. if l can"t get this money, l won"t be able to face anyone. So can l rest assured? Money is your responsibility and the work is mine. You"ll get the money before the work is done. - Fine, then come and have a drink. - Not today. Some other time,.... - after the work is done. - The work will be done! Brother, what took you so long? prashant had come and he was waiting for you for a long time. He"ll come to meet you in a day or two. He"s asked me to tell you not to get worked up. Just to arrange,... if the people come to know they will make,... Deep ti"s legitimate child also illegitimate. So this marriage has to be performed in front of society. - Bhandari, are your men ready? - Yes, all preparations are done. - ls he the one? - Yes. - Give him the money. - This is ten. And look, go underground for a month after the work is done. Bhandari, he looks so nervous. Will he be able to do the work? - it is my guarantee. - Are you sure? - They both are fine? - Yes. l"m leaving. Do the work carefully. Bhandari, let me know after the work is done. - Alright. - Be careful. Nathu, show him the picture. See it properly. My worker brothers, today we"ave gathered here,... so listen carefully,... that we must be focused about this strike. We go on strikes for our demands. But our strikes have become a means of earning for the leaders. They use us to exploit the bosses,.... to lead a licentious life. Listen to me carefully. This mill belongs to the workers, friends. He is talking in favor of the owners. You are misunderstanding my words. l understand you only too well. How much were you paid by the owners? Brothers, l"ave seen him several times with the mill owners. l"ll break your head if you utter a word against our leader. How dare you! Don"t fight. Calm down. This is a ploy to disrupt our meeting. Try to understand. There"s enough of uproar. l"ave done my job, now you do yours. Brothers, don"t run. Be brave. Go! Brothers, stop. Don"t let their ploy succeed. Don"t let their ploy succeed. She has maligned all of us. She is amoral. l wonder who"s the father of her child. Brother Devendra, you? What is this you did? l am Deep ti"s husband. l had to become illegal to make you legitimate. But unfortunately, instead of getting my sister married,... l made her a widow. Uncle! - What compulsion is this? - This is not compulsion. Do you want to meet your brother or want to perform his funeral? What do you mean? - Make him understand. - Take him inside, he"ll know. Come inside and you"ll know everything. Rogues, why did you bring him here? Why did they bring you? Don"t succumb to their pressure tactics. Don"t bother about my life. - l won"t. - Shut the door. Don"t succumb. professor, did you understand now? - Why did you bring Rajaram? - To kill him. - But what has he done? - He"s not done anything, you will do. You will go to the Commissioner"s house,... and tell Anita that vijay is waiting for her outside. Get her to the car somehow. Nagesh will do the rest. l understand your motive. l will not commit this sin. This sin will be committed. if you won"t do it, we will do it. Bring the head-master also. Why do you want to bring him alive? Kill him and bring his dead body. put on the gas in the kitchen. So that the peon also dies of suffocation. Don"t do this. You are also human. Stop it! l"ll do your work. Leave my brother. You are under arrest. - Me? - Yes, you. - What is my crime? - Abducting Commissioner Malik"s daughter. Anita"s abducted? What nonsense are you talking? You will realize it all in the police station. Commissioner, you could n"t devour my honesty. l gave you an advice but you ignored it. Now see the outcome of my challenge. it is your turn to see the outcome, Deva. - vijay has been arrested. - On what basis? - For kidnapping Anita. - Kidnapping Anita? - He was with me. - Your company gave your nephew this courage,.... to kidnap the daughter of the Commissioner of police. Deva, if vijay takes your name in his confession,... then l"ll personally come to arrest you. The walls of your jail are not strong enough,... to contain me or vijay. Sir, some people threw bombs on the police jeep and absconded with vijay. And this was stuck on the jeep in Deva"s name. in my name? Deva, by making vijay abscond,... you"ave proved him guilty in the eyes of the law. l"m standing here in front of you and yet you blame me? l consider you such a criminal,... who can be at one place but yet commit ten crimes in different places. Commissioner, if you want to show your legal prowess,... then my illegal prowess will lead to blood shed. Commissioner, why did you arrest my innocent son? He has kidnapped my daughter. My son is incapable of such an act. Your son may not do it. But Deva"s nephew can be expected of such a crime. - Where is vijay? - Until now he was in police custody. But now he is in his uncle"s safety. l made my house away from you. I had kept my vijay away from you influence. And you...once again you ruined my life. How did l wrong you? ls this the punishment for being your sister? - Deep ti, try to,.. - Don"t take my name. Tell me where have you kept vijay hidden or l"ll kill you. Well done! Shoot at your brother. And make history that a sister shot her brother dead. Commissioner, arrest Deva and prove it,.. that it is so easy to divide and rule India. What are you hinting at? Do you recollect l mentioned about a file? Before you could nab those criminals,... they"ave sowed seeds of suspicion and drawn you and Deva in a personal war. vijay did n"t abduct Anita. Then who dared to do this heinous crime? The ones who conspired to abscond with vijay. So that vijay could be blamed for kidnapping Anita,... and Deva could be accused of absconding with vijay. On what basis can you say all this? This is the truth and l"ave complete faith in it. - Deva, you can"t escape from here. - Sir, let him go. - Deva, stop or l"ll open fire. - Sir, no. patil, move from my way. patil, you will pay for this insolence. l will suspend you. Sir, you can do that tomorrow. But right now it would be better to follow Deva. Because one criminal knows the hide-outs of the other. And the ones Deva has gone to save is your daughter and your son. Where are you taking me? Leave me. Come inside and you"ll know everything. Shame on you. You put this innocent girl into trouble to save my life? l"m ashamed to call a coward like you my brother. l am a big coward. Child, please forgive me. Their threats compelled me to lie. But l will save you. Forgive me, l"ave wronged you. l did your bidding. Kill me if you want, but please release these children. Why should l release them? You are the guests for Nagesh and Anita"s marriage. A very important guest is also on his way. Move! How the mighty have fallen! Tie him up. Bhujang, remember, one day this game will become the game of your death. Deva"s wrath will finish you and your entire family. By now the Commissioner must have already arrested Deva. Now see the direct telecast of my manipulations. After getting Anita married to my son,... l"ll leave this country along with my family. After two days, the police,... will find another girl"s mutilated body in Anita"s clothes. And after four days vijay"s dead body will be found on some street. The Commissioner will assume that Deva killed his daughter. And Deva will think that by killing vijay, Commissioner has taken revenge. Bring the priest and commence the process of their doom. l don"t want to do this marriage. ls there any compulsion? - How can you not? - l"m fed with the first one,... why do you want to get me married again? You have to solemnize a marriage not get married. l"ave to solemnize a marriage? Could n"t you tell me this earlier? This is business. But today is not an auspicious day for marriage. The time at six in the evening after nine days,.. - is very good. - The marriage will take place now. Here? Now? - Are you getting an enemy married? - Shut up! it"s my son"s marriage. Then what are these unlucky people doing here? - Unlucky? - Yes. Throw them out first. They can"t go out or they will create a chaos. At least keep them away from the sight. They are so unlucky that the bridegroom will only die. Do you want that? l"ll try to clear their ill omen. You look familiar. - You? - Shut up! l"ll try to keep them busy, you find a way to get out of here. But be quick, he is a brute. Shut up, you unlucky man! Wretch! Witch! l"ll ruin you. l"m your principal. Don"t laugh. Wretch! l"ll ruin you. l"m your principal, don"t get scared. - Who is he? - l told you he"s my son. You are hiding here? He"s been possessed by a powerful spirit. He looks familiar. He"s hovering over his head. What are you doing here? You want to take his life? l will kill you but l won"t let you take his life. You will kill his father also? - Who is his father? - l am his father. He says he"ll kill you also. You can"t kill him when l"m around. There will be war. l"ll set you ablaze. Light the fire. priest, the fire is downstairs but why are you dancing? l"m dancing so that you have a long life. - Why are we feeling choked? - You have been possessed by spirits. Continue to cough and shed tears. Who knows from which part of the body the spirit may come out. - What was this sound? - it"s the spirits" sound,... but l"ave heard this tone for the first time. - These are gun shots. - No, listen. What is all this? Who is firing? Finish the rogues! This is the Lord of Death! Now your doom is confirmed. Sir, it"s me. Deva, forgive me. l was instigated by politician parshuram. He wanted to get you trapped in the Commissioner"s clutches. - Why? - He came to know that you were looking for him. it was parshuram who got your brother-in-law killed. Nathu knew about your relation. He had seen your sister in the temple with prashant Kapre. What are you thinking, Deep ti? l was thinking that we did a mistake by getting married. Brother is very tensed. And since he"s come to know about my pregnancy,... he"s even more tensed. He"s only worried about arranging money for the marriage. He got scared and when he came running to parshuram,... - Sir, this was too bad. - What happened, Nathu? The man whom Devendra has gone to kill is his to-be brother-in-law. He is not yet his brother-in-law, is n"t it? But what will happen is very important. Take this money, go drink and then go to sleep. Sir, l won"t let this happen. l"ll go and stop Devendra. l"d asked you about this earlier also. And l"d told you that if your answer is true,... then you will come to no harm. Or you will perish along with your people. Leave my father or l"ll kill this girl. No smartness! Deva, this is not an empty threat. Leave my father or the next bullet will go through her head. Nobody will move! Commissioner, ask your officers to discard their guns. Or you will become childless. put down your guns. l"ll open fire if anyone tries to act smart. Well done, son! Hurry up! No games! Open his handcuffs. Take care of your daughter and my family"s daughter-in-law. Now l"ll fulfill my promise to you. - Which promise? - My last crime. politician parshuram"s murder! No, Deva! l arrest you in anticipation. Commissioner, you"ave read the law but l"ave experienced it. You need a warrant to arrest me in anticipation. First get a warrant and let the city"s police force chase me,... yet l will kill parshuram. Deva, it is my duty to protect politician parshuram. And his death is my mission. Besiege the bungalow. The attack could be in any form. Arrest anyone who looks even slightly suspicious. Or shoot him. - What is all this? - This is the security arrangement for you. - My security? - Deva has got the reason to commit his last crime. And you are that reason. He has already proceeded with the intention to kill you. Then what about my meeting tomorrow? My fans have arranged such a big meeting for me. And which is very important for me in the forthcoming elections. l request you to cancel that meeting. Because it will be a problem to arrange security in a open ground. That is your problem", not mine. You find the solution. l have to attend tomorrows meeting. if my security arrangements are not upto the mark,... then l"ll move heaven and hell. Check everyone, no matter who he is. - What is it? - The minister"s security guard wants to talk to you. Ask them to await my orders. All roads leading from the minister"s house to here have been blocked. There"s more police than the common man. inform all the security forces. And the minister also that he can attend his meeting without fear. Forget Deva but even his shadow can"t penetrate such a tight security. Come. Brothers and sisters, you must be surprised,... to see such a tight security. But history bears testimony,... that every time a social worker like me does some good for society,... then often he is threatened,... and there are forces who want to finish him. And in bomb blast they are tried to,... There is no sound. Why is the microphone not working? Check the microphone. So far you"ave lost only your voice. in a short while you will also be lost from this world. Sir, his shadow did n"t come but his voice has come. But where is he? The cubicle where you are standing may be bullet proof,... but is not stone proof. if l want l can easily kill you. But l want to torture you and then kill you. in this ground, your death is lurking at every corner. Do you want to see a sample? There is a bomb right under your stage also. Come down immediately. Make way for the Minister. - Who"s it? - parshuram, there"s a bomb in your car also. parshuram, you can"t escape death by running from it. Forgive me. Forgive you who,... by killing Nathu brought about such doom. - No! - You widowed a sister at the hands of her brother,... and ruined everyone"s lives. You"ave made our lives a living hell. - Silence! - Help! - Leave him. - Help. Deva, don"t or l"ll shoot you! Commissioner, wait! Don"t handcuff him now. First, let a sister tie the sacred thread,... to her brother, after so many years. Today by reviving this relationship,... you"ave given me salvation, sister. Now the Commissioner"s prison will also seem like a gift.
