I don't know. Mum wore it so often, it's odd seeing it on you. Really? Why is it odd? - You don't love Mummy? - Take it off. Come here, sonny. Give Mummy a big kiss. Cut it out! What's up? You look weird. I don't feel like going anymore. Look at the zits I've got. There won't be any girls. All the same. It's a bummer. I can't see them. Sure. The make-up will cover them. You're a real head-case. Freaking out over a zit or two... Put this on. Hold out your arms. Perfect! C'mon, move. Move, you're the prettiest. Justa second, Mum. I'll say when. All right. Ready. I've got my work cutout, boys. Heels wreck my back. I'll wear my trainers instead. Nothing, just talking to myself. Can you turn the music down a bit? Either you listen to it full blast or not at all. Are the girls going as boys? Why? It's not a fancy dress party. So Where are you going like this? We're going to Rue Merciére to turn tricks. We thought we'd make more than by studying history. It's Kévin's stag night. Do you know him? Kévin? No, you don't know him. How old is he? Our age. And he's getting married? Surprising, huh? Reckless, I'd call it. Why? You and Dad were just 20 when you had Laure. Exactly. Reckless is the word for it. Bad example... Here we go. You're done. Your turn now. Clear off! Get in here, you. Mrs Lachenay, De’cine—Charpieu police station. Could you call us urgent/y on Mrs. Lachenay speaking. Antoine? Can I speak to my daughter? Laure? The police just called me. Your brother's been in a car accident. They say he's dead. FranQois! Are you sure you can drive? I'll have to. You can come to my place. For the night. I've brought him his Diesel sweater. Did he leave his baggy trousers here? The Wide ones. They weren't at my place. I've got everything out. He didn't leave much here. These are good, aren't they? Shall we dress him like this? He'll look handsome. We'll need to tell them to have his boxer shorts sticking out over his jeans... the way he |iked...to wear them. Come on now. I want to stay a While. I'll be along later. And the people? Open up the apartment for them. I need some time alone. Do you mind? Everything's ready. There's tea, coffee... All in flasks. Let's go. Your mother will join us later. Sure you don't want me to stay, Mum? I need to talk to you. Get in the car. I'll bring you back for the scooter. Get the flowers. He was driving. He's the one who hit the tree. We were worried. I'm sorry. You know Franck? Hello, Franck. He didn't dare come to the burial. I was right to bring him, wasn't I, FranQois? Yes. Sit down. What'll you have? Coffee? Tea? If there any tea left? I've no idea. Excuse me. I'm sorry. Why have you come? Calm down, sweetheart. Calm down. What's he doing here? Where can I go? I have no idea. Want me to help you? I don't know. What you're doing. No, thanks, I can manage. She must feel something too. Probably, yes. Was that the Figueira boy with you? Yes. He's grown. I wasn't sure I recognized him. You regret it? That he's grown? No, that you recognized him. I don't understand you, Camille. Stop it. You remind me of Mum when she acted sly, seeking God knows What. You're imagining things. I wasn't sure it was him. Now you're sure. I thought my son's best friend should be at his funeral. I didn't say anything. Do Whatever you want. Still, it's odd for those who know. Know What? What is there to know? Tell me, I'm interested. You know stuff about Mathieu's death? Here, lend a hand instead of talking rubbish. Laure's in a terrible state. Yes, I know. So am |. And you too. We're all in a terrible state. And we will be for a longtime. Did you see to Franck? No, I didn't see to Franck. Laure was upset you brought him. It's given her contractions. Don't be absurd. Contractions at three months! Listen... It's your problem now. This is your place. Go up to Mathieu's room and stay there until I call you. He loved this song. When we slept here, he couldn't sleep Without hearing it. You're here? Get lost! - You were at the grave? - A big crowd. Horrible. I told you to get lost! Calm down, Emilie. Get out, I said! This is too heavy... Come to the kitchen, Franck. Go on, piss off! Get lost! Get the hell out of here! Emilie! Stop that! Stop it right now. Are you okay? Everything all right? I want to go. I didn't realize how bad it was. I thought I'd just turned the car over. But I couldn't open the door. I turned to speak to Mathieu. He seemed to be okay. That's when I saw that the bodywork... It seemed to have penetrated him. He was still breathing. So I talked to him. His eyes showed he could hear me. The ambulance arrived. When they saw I was okay, they tried to get him out. And that was when he... I couldn't hear him breathing. What did you say to him? While you were waiting for the ambulance. I talked about memories, things we'd never forget. Like our first trip together with David and Quentin. The girls we met, their names, the evenings with them... I talked about happy memories. And then I told him... I told him he was my best friend and to keep his eyes open. As long as he could see me, he would be okay. What time is it? Ten o'clock. Sleep here if you want. Here, in his room? No... It's up to you. What are we going to do? I don't know. I'll stay and sleep with you. You scared me! FranQois told me you were already back at work. You should have taken more time off. What for? To go around in circles? I did that all week at home. Here at the shop at least, I get to see people. Seen these? No excuse not to come hiking now. They're hideous. Get used to the idea. And break them in. We're doing the Beaujolais hills this term. We're all waiting for you. It'll do us both good to get out in the open. Try them on. Try them on. I can change them. The shop's not far. You know my size. My feet haven't grown. See if the model suits you. Come on. Look. I wear mine in town. They look okay? We'll talk about it next week. All right. Mrs Lachenay? Please accept my condolences. Close the door behind you, please. I couldn't bring his geography paper. It hasn't been noted. It's sealed and anonymous. Mathieu was highly motivated. His recent grades were encouraging. Two colleagues who had him in tutorials have confirmed my impressions. Can I keep these? I think so. I'll let the main office know. Did the first semester grades count towards the result? He was likely to pass, then? Ithink so. Good. Thank you. It's important for me to have proof of his life. I understand. You know Franck Figueira? You're his tutor too? That's right. What can I tell you? Do you think he'll pass? I can't really say. He doesn't have the same profile. Franck is in one of my tutorials. He didn't present a paper last week. But Why? He's not alone. Half our students drop out at some point. He won't. I know him well. He must have been ill. Maybe. Believe me. He has to pass. - He has no choice. - We all do. He'll pass. I'm ready to bet on it. After 20 years teaching, I don't bet on students anymore. You'll see. Hello, Franck. Hello, Mr. Figueira. Your son hasn't been to his classes for two weeks now. You probably know since he's been here these last two weeks, right? You know Franck can't be on a work-site and at university? Yes, of course. It doesn't bother you? He's just helping out. He'll go after. No, he won't. It'll be too late then. There are 500 students and barely half will pass. Do you want him to pass? Yes, of course. But that's his business. After What happened, I feel responsible for Franck. I won't let him waste his life. I don't understand What you want. You've suffered a great deal. But so has he. Here, Franck. He helps out. It's good for him and I need him. You need him to work financially? His pay. Does he get it or you? I do. He works for the family. Only natural. All right. I understand. What do you understand? What do you mean by that? I'll take him Wednesday afternoon, Thursday morning, Saturday all day and a few evenings for signings. Almost a part-time job. I'll pay him the minimum wage and declare him, of course. He'll need to be in your tax returns. You won't forget? That's a total of 615 euros a month. I'll do two cheques each month... 307.50 euros each. I'll send you one and give him the other. He doesn't have an account. What's your bank? The post office. I'll ask at my bank. It's as good as the post office. Why a bookshop? He never reads. It's high time he did. Believe me, I'll keep him busy. That's agreed, then? I'll have to talkto him. And my husband too. I'll do a proper work contract. I'll get my accountant to see it. I'll see Franck next Wednesday. All right. No more sites. I'm serious. He has to pass. It's important. You understand? Very important! - More? - Empty these too. There's no room. I'll help you but I can't work miracles. Don't put a paperback on display! Put a fancy book to attract the customer. It's good. You should redecorate my place. Stay on the till. Customers shouldn't wait to pay. Marie, Franck's here to work. I know that. So stop distracting him. What Wine do these vines produce? Just a good, simple Beaujolais. The soil looks good. The exposure too. You'll get to sample it later. We're visiting a Wine cellar. You need a guidebook Within reach. Yes, I take an interest. We're glad to see you back. Too bad you missed the Vercors hike. We saw a new side to Isabelle. I've never cursed so much in my life. | get vertigo. I thought I was going to die. Next to that, today's hike is an easy stroll. Good, that's just What I needed. We can imagine. I don't think so. You can't really imagine it. It's just a manner of speaking. You know, even if I wasn't there, I was devastated by What you went through. - You got my note? - Yes. Thank you. You're welcome. I wasn't sure you'd get it from Tangiers. - I heard about the funeral. - You heard What? Ludo told me that boy, the one who did it... turned up after the burial. Stop it, Camille. - It's a misunderstanding. - So let's clear it up! Listen here, Ludo. And you too, Isabelle. My son's funeral went off smoothly. I invited Franck myself. The boy who was driving the car that night. I got it wrong. You certainly did. I'll explain. Franck is someone very important for me now. Dozing off? Let's go back. |'|| photocopy your notes. - You're going? - Got to see someone. You'll fail at this rate. If it's a problem, I can ask someone else. - No, it's for your sake. - Don't worry. |'|| manage. Where are we going? For heaven's sake! Open the glove-box. Give me a cigarette. Light it, I'm driving. Do me a favour... What's wrong? Nothing. I'm sorry. You can drive. I need to calm down. If I'd known, I'd have brought flowers. No, don't stop! Go to the end of the road, Where the field starts. How fast were you going? 55 mph, more or less. Do a U-turn. The road's clear. You're doing 35, you can speed up. Go on, accelerate. 50, good. Faster. Don't slow down. Shit! You're slowing down! Speed up! Stop it! Speed up! Wait, Franck! Don't go. You don't understand. Understand What? I didn't mean to scare you. I wanted to understand how it happened. Do What you like. But it's stupid to end like this. What is it? He doesn't live here? I got it wrong? No, it's not that. Not at all. But... Sorry to disturb you. I can't reach Mathieu, so I thought I'd come round. I'm glad you did. Come in. It's early. I thought he'd be here. I remember he used to sleep so late. Is something wrong? No... I'mjust so clumsy. You should have said. I'm a waitress. I'd understand if he's met someone else. We're young. Ijust wanted to see him, as a friend. I was in France, so the chance arose. VVhy? - Where are you from? - Portugal. Explaining the lovely accent... We met in Lisbon, last summer. I know. He went there with his best friend, Franck. He's Portuguese too. It was good. I've tried calling Mathieu ever since I got here, but he must have changed numbers. And since I don't have Franck's, I came here. It would be a shame to leave Without seeing him. Yes, he had trouble with his mobile. I don't know much about those things, but he changed numbers. Never mind. At least I've met you. He talked about you when we were walking in Lisbon. He said the city resembled you, that you'd be happier there. Well, that's What he said. I know. He hated Lyon. Can you give him this? I won't have time to come again. It will bring back happy memories for him. Thank you, for him. I waited all evening for you. You needn't have worried. I said I'd be back late. It's Camille again! I'm not here. No, he's still not here. She hung up. She saw you come in. She called five or six times. It was driving your dad crazy. He's on mornings this week. So I stayed by the phone. Why didn't you unplug it? How would we have known if anything happened to you? I'm here now. You can go to bed. See you in the morning. What does she expect us to do about it? It's crazy. He's lost. Where do you live? He doesn't speak French. Is it the right floor? No idea. But I'm not worried about him. It's outrageous. Aren't there any decent neighbors to take him back home? Look, it's really late. I'm beat. You're not here to do social work. So say What you need to say. So tell me Why you're outside my place at 2 AM. Why do you follow me? Why do you keep calling my parents? Answer me. If that's your attitude, Why talk? You think I'm happy to see you after What happened? That's Why I came here. To apologize. Here. I don't want your money. You think I'd do that? You really despise me. They're concert tickets. I was supposed to go with Mathieu. Come if you want. If not, never mind. It's up to you. I won't bother you again. What's up, Mum? I'm getting trampled. This is no place for me. Give me your hand and don't let go. Ready? Come on. Vodka and cranberry, please. The gig's starting. You still serve? Yes, but... Good. Vodka and cranberry. Vodka's not possible. We only serve beer or Wine. A beer then. Two euros. Excuse me... The same again. Why are you smiling? Nothing. It's funny, you come to a gig and stay at the bar. Shall we go? I'm glad you've come. Have some. It's good. Don't look so wary. Try it. What's this scar here? It's like a war wound. I'm proud of it. It was my firstjob with Dad. The sharp side of a rubble stone fell on my wrist. I was pissing blood. Strange, the line is clear, as if a blade did it. No, it wasn't a blade. The day it happened, it wasn't so clear. I broke a few fingers. I even have a scar on my palm. Look. You poorthing... That stuff looks disgusting. We should have found a restaurant. I think she misses Mathieu too. At first, she spent all day meowing at his door. What's up, beauty? Albator, Albator... From deep in the golden night Why are you singing that? Know it? The "Albator" theme song. Vaguely. That's Why he called her Stelli. Stelli was Albator's protégé. An orphan. She had grey hair. And since she had grey fur, he called her Stelli. Right, beauty? He never told me. It's not very important. Of course it's important. The tiny things are the most important. Can you tell me other things about him? No, you mustn't. Not now. You're not driving back in this state. Don't worry. I'll be okay. You'll sleep here. In the living room. I'm Mrs Lachenay. - Is he alone? - Yes, ma'am. What are you doing here? How about a hello? Who raised you? What's wrong? Nothing. Just a surprise visit. It's five years since you came here. Yes, and you haven't redecorated. Camille, that's not my decision. Will you buy me dinner? You didn't let me know. Sorry, but I'm busy tonight. Never mind. I'll be going then. Known her long? No, since last September. Before that. She arrived in June. It's just an affair then? I don't know yet. That depends on you. Your sex life's nothing to do with me! I knew I shouldn't have told you. Not at all, an affair's good. When we divorced, the judge awarded me alimony. But no one mentioned chastity. Are you seeing someone? Was she at the funeral? Answer me. No, I'm not. So was she there? Yes. Where? I forget now. Behind us. Did she go up to the coffin? When it was open or after? At the funeral home one evening. - She saw him? - Yes. She found him handsome? You should have. Off you go. Dinner's waiting. What are you going to do? You know What I'm going to do. Off you go now. Go on! I heard you've hired Franck at the shop. What are you after? None of your business. I don't see What fascinates you. God, you're so disappointing! Just go now. "I put my arm around George. "He rests his chin on my shoulder. "| kiss his temple, believe it or not. "That's when I hear this roar. "I can't hear the poetry anymore. "I turn. David's playing an air guitar. "He strikes a very violent chord. "A car smashes through the wall, rolls over David "and stops, barely scratched. "The two doors open. "David's body is shredded. "His insides emerge from the holes in his shirt, "blue and greasy and jumbled. "It looks like a flower bed." Do you ever read your own writing? I prefer reading someone else's book in public. Otherwise, you sound like a priest at mass, kneeling before you own work. Thanks anyway. Marie will drive you back. How about a drink? I don't know Lyon. Why not? Franck, do you know a good place? Sorry, I can't stay. I have to let the babysitter go. That's okay. You won't be joining us in your condition. Antoine will be here any second. The baby's moving a lot. We'll be going then. Give Antoine my love. Coming, Franck? This is handy. Your hotel isn't far. Wouldn't you rather sit down? No way. We're here for this, for the bar. It's magical. You're alone and in a group. Isolated but not closed off. What do you feel? Not a lot. Except that it's cold, slightly sticky and I hate it. That man knocked over his coffee and the barman won't replace it unless he pays. I've been watching them. The customer isn't dishonest. He's humiliated at buying another when he didn't drink the first, as if it had been stolen. Maybe he can't afford another. Barman! I'll buy him a coffee. Go now, sir! Calm down! You amazed me. I didn't know you got into fights. I don't get into fights. Let's just say I have guts. And modest with it! I can do a lot of things. No doubt. I hope so for your sake. Such as What? This. How about you? No secret talents? I had one, a longtime ago, as a teenager. I was good with a hula-hoop. - Awhat? - A hula-hoop. It's a hoop you keep up by swivelling your hips. You move a bit like this. I can't really do it now, but I was the queen of the hula-hoop. My hair too perhaps. People complimented me on it. I tried different colours and every possible style. I never really looked after it. There, my two claims to fame. Nothing much, really. Did you ever see Mathieu fight? He wasn't physical. Just like his father. They hate doing odd jobs or sport... I'm really into physical stuff. Mathieu called me a navvy. | work my grandparents' land in Portugal. | plant stuff, grow things, see to the orange trees... I love that. Not many boys do that now. But I'm not like other boys. - You'll have to prove it. - Anytime. Okay. Now. What are you doing? Sorry I can't be more help, Mr Lachenay. I can release her but that's all. The case remains open. Could there be a restraining order? That's not really my remit. But if their closeness led to this, the judge may well rule that. There's no need to press charges to keep Camille away from your son. Let me take care of everything. You can trust me. She needs a shrink. Get a psychiatrist's report done. Try to get her into a rest home for a While. I can give you some names. Thanks, Marie-Claire. I'm really sorry. If I can help, don't hesitate. Did you have to pay? This is so grotesque. At least we agree on that! Wait, FranQois. And Franck? Is it odd being a grandfather? I don't know. It depends on What your son calls me. Grandpa's nice. Grandpa FranQois. And you, Camille? Thought about it? About What? What do you want him to call you? Gran? Grannie? Grandma? Spare me! I'd like him to call me... Camille. I can't imagine calling Grandma... Elise. I bet he'll like using my first name. Want to hold him? Take a picture. Let me see. It's a good one. I'm worn out. I'm going. What about Antoine's parents? Go on. They'll understand. After all, they're late. I'm sorry, Antoine. Apologize for me. Okay, sweetheart? What's he doing? He's yawning. It's a nice spot for a drink. - Can Ijoin you? - Of course. It's okay, Quentin. We have to go. Take care, everybody. When did they meet? I don't know. A month or two ago. That's good. I was worried about her after Mathieu died. Luckily you get over things at that age. She hasn't forgotten him. Time to go. - | disturbed you? - No, we're going to the movies. Good idea. To see What? We don't know yet. After exams, we need something to clear our heads. When you need to fill them, come to the bookshop. I'd like to help. That goes for all of you. What'll you have? It's on me. A coffee. Quentin! - Thanks for the coffee. - You're welcome. Excuse me, can I help you? Why not take ten copies of "Ce qui reste" by Rachid O? - Do you know him? - Yes. Rachid O has a book that Gallimard is bringing out in two weeks... Excuse me. I'll let Marie take over. Can you see to the order? Yes, of course. We've brought the scooter back. It was his birthday present. Leave us alone. The judge said you can't see Franck. I didn't see him. I had it delivered! I didn't bring it. You know that! He's our son, you understand. He's suffered enough. Listen, we're there to help him. Get lost. Get lost, I said! Take it. I'm giving it away! Take it. I'm giving it away. It's yours. Take it. I'm giving it away! It's yours. Go ahead. I'm giving it away. What are you doing here? How about a hello? I brought Jules but then I saw this mess. I don't need you to clean for me. It looks like you do. Let me do it. Keep an eye on Jules. He'll wake up soon. Where is he? You didn't see him? His pushchair's in the hall. Go on! Don't get in my way. Pick him up. Don'tjust let him cry. Forget it. |'|| nurse him. I don't like you coming here While I'm out. I don't like you taking liberties like this. Sorry, I didn't know. I've always had the key. I'd like it back. Right now! You're being absurd... Hand it over! This is ridiculous. Make us some tea instead. Get out of my home! You're crazy! Mind Jules! Get out! Stop it! I'm not dead, Mum. You understand? I'm here. You won't get rid of me. You may not like it but I'll be here! I'm not going to die too! - Can I walk with you? - Yes. Where are you going? No idea. Just strolling. I have my bus at Cordeliers. - Let's go there then. - My name's Fabrice. And I'm... Excuse me. Go ahead, I'm listening. All right. I'll check the flights. I can't talk right now. But that's fine. Saturday, yes. The 3:30 PM flight or earlier if I find one. Take care. Here. No, keep them. Yes, Pension Alfama. I want to see Franck Figueira.
