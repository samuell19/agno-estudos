Soyuzmultfilm THE BREMEN TOWN MUSICIANS (musical fantasy based on Grimm's Tale) There's nothing better to behold Than for friends to roam around the world And close friends the hardship do not fear All the roads they're sure to find dear. All of them we always find so dear. We have our calling and our path- We bring people joy and make them laugh And the palace domes' enticing space Never our freedom will replace. Oh, they never never will replace Our carpet is the field of flowers. Giant pines ? they form the walls of ours. Our roof ? the vast blue sky up there Our joy ? one destiny to share! Yes, to have one destiny to share. Little bird in a pen- In its 'home' it is trapped. I am just like it then: In this 'keep' I am 'kept'. Sun makes bright things around As for me, dark I stay. Without princess I'm bound to not live one more day. Oh, pray tell, what is this? What has happened to me? Shot to 'pieces' my 'peace', In these chambers, I see. ?Baddie? ? is what people call us Rumor goes that misery we bring Give me cards and I'll assess What shall happen to the king Pang-bang-ding Pang-bang-ding ...what will happen to the king! Lengthy trip the cards foretold- Morning comes he'll up and go. King, he has a lot of gold. And this gold-I love it so! Oh-say-oh Oh-say-oh Yes, this gold-I love it so Royal card will soon be beat Same will happen to his guards Job is easy, spoils are sweet I see truth in all these cards! Pang-bang-ding Pang-bang-ding Morning comes, we'll rob the king. Pang-bang-ding Pang-bang-ding Morning comes, we'll rob the king Cock-a-doodle-doo! Meow! Hee-Haw!Hee-Haw! Bark-bark! We're honored and we're kept in high regard! -In high regard! -Yes, high regard! The king cannot exist without his guard The ground shakes under our marching feet We're always by his side and we're upbeat Too bad that sunrise We meet with our eyes! If a sparrow's nearby We'll get cannons ready! Even if it's just a fly- Our guns are steady! King's travel plans are strictly classified! -They're classified! -Yes, classified! And we are always staying by his side. We're here to protect our dear king From anything that fate is sure to bring! Too bad that sunrise We meet with our eyes! If a sparrow's nearby We'll get cannons ready! Even if it's just a fly- Our guns are steady! Oh, it's well-known ? we're the hot-tempered folk We don't take kindly... kindness or a joke! Up! ? our victims frequently the daisies push We beat people up Love to beat them up ?and beat 'round the bush. One-two and yikes ? the guns are drawn! We're villains, robbers, bandit spawn! Bang-bang and you'll be gone! You will be dead, you will be gone, be gone? Bang-bang and you'll be gone! You will be dead, you will be gone, be gone? When people see us, sure enough, they yell! ?The smoking gun? for some has an unpleasant smell! There's something hidden in our pockets too Don't come close to us! Don't come close to us!!!!! Or we will slaughter you! One-two and yikes? the guns are drawn! We're villains, robbers, bandit spawn! Bang-bang and you'll be gone You will be dead, you will be gone, be gone? Bang-bang and you'll be gone You will be dead, you will be gone, be gone? Oh where has this path taken me, where? My life is not dear without princess fair If only the glorious king would impart The deep secret path to the princess's heart! Since nothing and no-one could scare me away I'd do something worthwhile for the king today! Since nothing and no-one can scare me away. I could do a brave deed... for our king today. Cock-a-doodle-doo! Doodle-doo-ooh! Cock-a-d... There's nothing better to behold Than for friends to roam around the world And close friends the hardship do not fear All the roads they're sure to find dear. All of them we always find so dear... Don't forget our calling and our path- -We bring people joy and make them laugh! And the palace domes' enticing space Never our freedom will replace. Oh, they never never will replace!
