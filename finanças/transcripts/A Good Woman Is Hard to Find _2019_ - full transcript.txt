Couldn't wait, eh, lovie? - That's eighteen thirteen. - Mummy! Yep, just, um... I actually think I'm a bit short. Oh. Oh, you might have enough in there, lovie. No, erm... Let's see, let's see. Actually, could you just ring these things off? We've all been there, lovie. Vote for Amy Taylor. Get your fairness, equality, and liberty! Amy Taylor is the future, kids! Amy Taylor!

When the cabin portholes are dark and green because of the seas outside, and the ship goes wop with a wiggle between and the steward falls into the soup tureen and the trunks begin to slip and slide When Nursey lies on the floor in a... Heap! And mummy tells you to let her... Sleep! You aren't waked or washed or... - Dressed! - Well, then you will know - if you haven't... - Guessed! You're fifty north and forty... West! Yeah!

They know me, they're looking after my husband's... I need your name, love. No, sorry, I don't think you understand. They're looking after my husband's case. Stephen Collins. Is this about a restraining order? No. Sarah? - Yeah. - Can I call you Sarah? Yeah. Just let sleeping dogs lie. He's going to spill that. Ben. Hold your glass properly. That's a new tablecloth. He can still hear, can't he? Yes, he can hear. I don't understand it, if he can talk, why doesn't he just talk? When's the appointment? - Thursday. - I'll go with you. - There's no need. - I know you, you'll just sit there and let them walk all over you. If you want to get anywhere in this life you have to be a bit of a bitch. You'd know, would you, Mam? Just make sure you get some answers. Don't be sitting there like a pudding. You're too soft, Sarah. Always were. Anything from the police? No. That estate. Nothing good ever came out of it. - Stephen came out of it. - No, he didn't. He stayed in it and you joined him. Well, it's called marriage. Don't know why you can't come back here to live. Do you need money? No, I'm fine. - We're fine. - You don't look fine. What do you say, princess? Wouldn't you like to come live with granny? Bitch! Ben, do you want to give these to daddy? Maybe if you want to say something to him, you can. Yeah? Okay? That was really good. Ah, the fuck? Hey! Hey! What the fuck! Wait! Stop, stop, stop! - Not a fucking word! - No, get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Let's go. Stay! Don't fucking say a word. Fuck! No. Stop, stop, stop! Stop. What the fuck is this? Netflix? - Stop. - Who else is here? - Who else is here? - It's just the three of us. Good. Can they stop fucking looking at me? Can I put them in their room, yeah? It's just here. It's just here. Go on. Sit in here just one minute, okay? The man's gonna go. Just don't open the door. Promise me, promise me? You got no fucking towels in there. Okay, you don't know me. I don't know you. Even fucking better. You don't know me. You seen nothing. Nothing fucking happened. - You get me? - Yeah. Please go. "Go?" Fuck me. You could be a wee bit more... fuck. Hospitality. Hospitable! Hospitable. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Off. - Hold on. Hey! Two wee ones. Fuck's sake. My fucking arm. Hard day. Fucking hammerhead, come on. Ah. Will you come on? Fuck's sake. Ah! Fuck. No joy. He's not working any of our estates. So what are you doing here? Everybody's on it. So what are you doing here? We just thought we'd... - C'mon. - Fuck off? Who made the poorest poorer? Who let youth unemployment rise higher? Who made inequality greater? Not us! Don't you dare lecture us on poverty. You have failed to help the poorest people in our country. Open the door. Open the door. Come on. Open the fucking door. Open the door or I'll smash the fucking glass, let's go! I'm opening it, I'm opening it. Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Every little helps. I don't want any part of this. I don't... I... What's the panic? Nobody knows I'm here. Nobody knows this is here. It's fucking perfect. I took ten of these earlier and sold them. Twenty quid a pop. Two hundred quid. And I have your cut. Forty percent, that's for helping me out. Forty percent there. No, no, no, no. I don't want your money. I don't want this here, I really just want you to leave. No. You see, I got a fucking problem. I got nowhere to stash this. I'm living with two cunts. You'd need eyes in your fucking head. So I was thinking, right, I keep it here. Come in and out, bit at a time. Nobody knows me. Nobody fucking sees me. Nobody would cop on with you and the two rug rats. It's perfect. Five days, right? I give you a cut. Everyone's laughing. It's dope, man, it's fucking dope. Look, I just don't want it. I just want you to go, yeah? Stop, stop! Stop! That's the way it's gonna be, alright? - Mm-hm, mm-hm. - Or I skin you and your two wee fucking pups. Ben. My love, I'm so sorry, okay. We'll go in a minute, I promise. Can you remember, were you... Were you standing here with daddy when... Did he leave you in the play-park? Yeah? Is that what happened? Do you remember who daddy was talking to or if he saw someone? Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'll stop asking. I'm so sorry. Open the fucking door. Fucking freezing out there. You want one? No. What about, what about a beer says you, eh? Mm. Business first. Sold sixteen of these today. - That's yours, eighty percent. - Stop it. - I told you I don't want it. - Don't start that shit again. Fuck me. Look at all these cunts. Their shiny faces. Fuck me. Your man was right to try to blow all the fuckers up. What d'you call him? That bonfire cunt. You really like that word. What? What is it with you? You don't like the way I talk, you don't take a drink. - Do you smoke? - No, I don't smoke. You into God or some of that shite? Fucking wee baby Jesus on the cross. Telling you if I was there, it'd have been different. I'd have pulled my hands out of those nails and floated there in front of all them Romans. They'd have known who I was, alright. I don't think that's the point. What fucking point? I got these for your rug rats. - Thought they might still be up. - Oh, no. They're asleep. In bed. Well, give it to them when they get up. Or eat them yourself. You don't do fuck all else. You must like sweets. Skinny birds like sweets, don't they? Fat girls like cake. How old are they anyway? - Six and four. - Mm. I like kids. I'd like to have some. Have to be the right woman, but not some of these sluts you see. Fuck. You go into town at a weekend. You wouldn't know what was a prozzie and what was a good girl. Your dick'd fall off with half of them. So, can I, er... Can I ask you something? - Tito. - Oh, right. - Uh, Tito, so... - Tito. It's not my nickname. It's my name. It's different but I kind of like it. You know when you're a kid, you wanna be the same as everyone else but when you get older, you wanna be different. What do I call you? Sarah. Oh, good name. Like an old girl's name. Thank you. Look. Why is TV always so shit? All these fucking shows about eating. Have you ever heard of a man called Stephen Collins? Is he famous? No, he's my.... He was my husband. He clear off, did he? No, he died. Cancer? No, no, it wasn't cancer. He was murdered. Stabbed. Here on the estate. Jesus. - Is that him there? - Yeah, yeah. Is that you? Yeah. You don't look nothing like that now, eh! Thank you. You don't, but... You should tidy yourself up a wee bit. Who killed him then? I don't know. Well, nobody saw what happened or... At least nobody came forward. And they just found Ben. Crying beside... Sorry, Ben was with him. Ben is my son. I was just wondering if you knew something. Anything. Me? What would I know? You don't shit where you live. Okay, so... So what happened yesterday? Was it the police? Are you stupid or something? Jesus, no. Tito, I'm just really, really confused. You were running from someone. - You were running from? - Miller's mob. I stole that bag off Miller's mob. Like candy from a fucking shop, it was. - Miller's mob? - Aye, Leo Miller. He's got the pub in town. Real fucking animal. You stole from Leo Miller? What did I just say? So, they'll be looking for you, right? They'll have put the word out or they'll have... Put the word out? Seriously? No, I just need a few days and I'll be set. If they do catch up with me, I've got a few surprises up my sleeve. You have to get out of my house. You can't come back here. You really can't. Oh, don't start that shit again. No. Tito, please understand, come on, I've... I've two little kids, yeah? Who just lost their dad. I just... I can't have drugs in the house, I can't. What'd you call him again? Stephen. Aye. Collins? - Yeah. - Aye. I have heard of him. He was in the paper. He was selling. Stephen was not selling drugs. He wasn't dealing drugs. If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, - it's a fucking duck. - He had Ben with him, okay, - that would never have happened. - Smart. Using the kid as cover. So what? He was a dealer, so what? My husband was not a fucking drug dealer. A "fucking" drug dealer? How fucking dare you? A fucking drug dealer. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Have a bit of fucking respect for him. - Yeah. - You know, what we do isn't easy. What we do is fucking hard, alright? Now can I watch this fucking in peace without you in my fucking face? Fuck. Yeah, go on. Pick one. That one? Okay! Pay day, love? Here, how much you charging anyway? What did you just say? Mummy's gonna show you how to eat spaghetti. Spoon. Fork. No, Lucy, not with your fingers! Mummy! So I said to myself, "Who are my two best men?" Of course, I came up with the only answer I could come up with. Terry. Mackers. And there they both were, sitting in the car. "Am I a fool?," I thought. Of course I'm not a fool. I run a big business. I employ people. I'm an important man. I thought, 'course they'll be back. Two hours tops. And here we are, eight o'clock. My break. Ben? Ben, don't... please don't do that, Ben! Please don't do that. Okay, come on. Come on, you okay? We're just gonna wash you, okay? We're just gonna quickly... Ben, look at me. Okay, I'm just gonna wash it off. No, no, no, stop, stop. I'm just gonna wash it off. Are you okay? Are you okay? Ben? Oh! It's okay. Hey, it's okay, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Good boy. It's okay. Ben, if you feel sick, okay, you have to tell me. Yeah? Please, listen to me. You have to tell me. Do you feel okay? Yeah? You don't feel sick? - Shh, no, don't move. - Open the door, Sarah. - Sarah, open the fucking door. - Lucy, don't move. Don't have me knock the door down. Open the door. Fuck me. Now look what you've made me do. For fuck's sake. You stupid fucking wee bitch. Tito. What? What's wrong? Tito... Stay here. Stay here. Yeah. Tito, listen. No. Tito. Tito, it was just a mistake. He's just a kid, he didn't know what he was doing. Look, I'll pay for it. I'll give you whatever I have. It was a mistake. Yeah? I can fix it. I'll fix it. Whatever you want. Tito, Tito. Please stop. Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop. Get the fuck off me! Fucking tell me how much you want me. Stop, please. You want me. Tell me you want me. Tell me you fucking want me or it's your fucking little kid. Your choice. - I do. - You want me? I do. - Good girl. - I do. I do want you. I want you. I always knew you liked me. Always knew it. You're so fucking sexy. Fuck me. - You want me to fuck you? - I do. Please fuck me. - I don't wanna hurt you. - I want it to hurt. I want it to hurt. I do. I fucking love you. I love you, Sarah. Sarah, I fucking want you. - I want you. I do. - Sarah, I fucking love you. You fucking sexy fucking... Agh! Fuck! Jesus! Fuck! - You fucking little slut! - Stop! Stop! Stop! Get off me! Get off me! You're the same as all those other fucking sluts, aren't you? Aren't you? You fucking dirty slut! Fuck. Oh, god. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Mummy? Open the door. No, don't open the door! Don't open the door! - Mummy! - Don't open the door! Mummy's coming. Mummy's coming. - Don't open the door! - Fucking hell. Mummy's coming. - Oh my god. - Mummy, mummy, mummy! Oh my god. Oh my god. I'm coming! Mummy! It's the man, he... He just fell down and hit his head. He's gonna lie down for a little bit. He's just very tired. Do you wanna go into the living room and watch a DVD? - Yeah. - Yeah? Ben, will you bring your sister in? Close the door. Tito? Tito? Oh, fuck. Fuck. - You both okay? - Yeah. So, the man's gone. Okay. The man's gone. Mrs. Collins? Yeah? Yeah, who is it? Police. - It's Mrs. Collins, isn't it? - Yes? Could you open the door, Mrs. Collins? We've had reports of a disturbance. Fuck. As I said, we've had reports of a disturbance. I... Got yourself a new fella on the go then, love? Sorry..? Sorry, where are you going? We've had reports of shouting. Fight, maybe? You been drinking? I'll have to report this. Anything you want to report? Well? Would it matter? What is it with women like you? Excuse me? You like being knocked about, huh? Get out! Get out of my house! Get out of my house right now. We're going. But don't worry, love We'll be back. You better get your shit together. For them. Lucy, love, mummy's got some things to do. - Okay? - Okay. Fuck's sake. Tayto? Tito. As in General fuckin' Tito. Yugoslavia, before all that shit happened. Sometimes you surprise me, Mackers. He was in Dunelm yesterday. Grattan and Forestside today. - Tito... - Reilly. We don't know where he is yet. But we'll have that info by tomorrow. Tito Reilly. I'm gonna chop you up bit by little fucking bit. Mummy. Mummy, mummy. - It's just for tonight. - A bar? Yeah, it's just a few hours. I saw a sign in a window. "Temporary staff." It's just tonight. And maybe a night at the weekend as well. What bar? I don't know about you in a bar, Sarah. Yeah, well, what you don't know won't hurt you. Be good for your gran. Bye! Bye, love. Ben, I love you. When's his appointment? The hospital? Oh, it's... It's tomorrow. - Had you forgotten? - No, no, no, it's... It's, er, it's just... I'll be here first thing, okay? Maybe you should forget about - this thing tonight. - First thing, okay, Mam? First thing. - Sarah? - What? What? What? You look wretched. - Mam, I'm fine. - No, you're not. You don't look fine. I'd say you were going to meet a man except you look like death warmed up. Mam, I really don't have time for this. No time for your health? - Sarah, you have two children. - For Christ's sake. - I'm just saying! - I know, I know. That I should just snap out of it. - I'm not saying that. - That's exactly - what you're saying. - No! Mam, I loved Stephen. - Love... - Yeah! Yeah, love. But that's something you couldn't understand. You sound like a bad song. He was just the man who came and took away your little girl, wasn't he? Yeah! A little girl who had her whole future ahead of her and now look. A talented girl! - He was a drug dealer! - No. He was! - He wasn't! - He was! That's what the papers said and that's what the police think. Nothing but a two-bit drug dealer. Didn't he have a record? It's... it's not the same thing. Won't you see sense, Sarah? I'm sorry, but it has to be said. Okay, great, and now that you've said it, you can go fuck off. Tito Reilly. We don't know where the fuck he is. I swear. Honest. He never came back last night. Look, we don't really know him anyway, man. Don't call me "man." Find some other noun. But we don't. He just comes and goes. Give me that again, with the noun. He just comes and goes... Sir? Better. Tito. Only Tito I ever heard of was General Tito. Presidente of Yugoslavia. Then he died. And the place went to shit. Same happened in Iraq. Old Saddam might have been a cunt, but the country functioned with those cast-iron balls of his. People just went about their normal, everyday business. Take Syria at the minute. Why are the Russians propping up the regime? Putin and Assad. Two more cunts. But they know about leadership. And fear. Real-politik, they call it. You interested in real-politik? When the status-quo is threatened, the ends justify the means. Thank you, Terry. In other words, we must think of the greater good, gentlemen. You do recognize the metaphor in this situation, huh? Metaphor. Gimme a metaphor. Black, black as coal. No, no, no. That's a simile. Black as coal. Fuck me! Don't, please don't. Please! Fuck, please, please! Jesus Christ. On me fucking shoe, you twat! Listen to me, listen to me. - Please, please. - Oh, don't. Oh, wipe your face. - Please, please. - Wipe your face. - Please. - Er, not please, please, please. - That's not a metaphor. - Uh... Let me give you one. - In deep shit. - No, no, please! Yeah, yeah. In deep shit. You don't mind if I get rid of some change, do you? Can always use the change, love. There's bound to be easier ways, love. Just throw him out. It's better than all this. I'm just gonna do it. I'm just gonna do it. God. Hi, Mam. Hi! - Hi. - Mummy. Hi, love! Are you both ready, yeah? I just have to talk to your gran. Okay. Mam. Look, about yesterday, I just... What use are apologies? I never thought I would see the day when my daughter... This looks quite nasty. You don't say. How did you do it, sir? Wanking. Do you like playing with your sister? Tito. Love... That man won't bother us anymore. Please stop saying his name. - Yeah. - Yeah? Bottom line, Mrs. Collins, Ben will talk again. Put simply, Ben doesn't want to talk about what happened. Or even more simply, he hasn't a clue how to talk about it. He can't rationalize it. Make sense of it. So his brain has locked it down. Shunted it off into a dusty corner somewhere. And with it, his speech, because his brain knows that once he talks, he'll go searching in that dusty corner. And that's something his brain, for the moment, doesn't think he'll be able to deal with. I'm sorry. I know it's one thing giving an explanation. It's another giving a solution, but this isn't an exact science. Now. A dusty corner of his brain? It's a metaphor, Sarah. It's, you know, if you want... Don't tell me what a metaphor is. I know what a metaphor is. Just like I know what rationalize means. Tito! Lucy, please, please stop. Tito. Love, please stop. Come on. Going home. Not Tito. Not Tito. Where were you rammed? I know it was on the estate. I mean where exactly were you rammed? Mrs. Collins? My name is Emily Scott. I'm with Social Services. You will need to get that properly fixed, Mrs. Collins. Yeah, I'm getting it fixed. Now, you understand that Social Services need to follow up on such reports. But this is just a chat, nothing formal. Now, according to the police report, there was a disturbance? The house was unkempt? - Unkempt? - Untidy. I had just made dinner and I didn't have time to wash the dishes. Believe me, I'm a mother too. After dinner at our house, you'd think a bomb had gone off in the kitchen. There was evidence of alcohol having been consumed. I had wine with dinner. How much, would you say? I know these questions may seem intrusive, Mrs. Collins, but believe me, I am here in a supportive capacity. I am aware that your husband died. He was murdered. I'm very sorry. It must be difficult for you. My husband being murdered? Yes, quite difficult. I mean coping. What, with the fact that the police have done nothing to find his killer? - I mean with the children. - No. They're my children. I'm their mother and I love them. I'm sure you do. Yes, I do. And I'm sure we're all agreed that they are what is most important in all of this, Sarah. Tell me what happened the other night, Sarah. Okay, look, I... Yes? Do you use a vibrator? Do I what? The man who was here. The disturbance. I stabbed him in the eye with my vibrator. I don't understand. Well, he wanted to fuck me and I didn't want to. So I had to stab him in the eye with my vibrator. That's what happened the other night. You want me to write that in my report? It's what happened the other night. Goodnight. Goodnight, love. - Story! - No, your mam's too tired. Whale, whale! Do you wanna? Is that okay with you, Ben? Okay. But a quick one, okay? Okay. Do you know your gran used to read this book to me? No, I didn't know that. She did. "In the sea once upon a time, o my best beloved, there was a whale and he ate fishes. He ate the starfish and the garfish. The crab and the dab. And the plaice and the dace. And the skate and his mate. And the mackerel and the pickereel. And the really, truly, twirly-whirly eel. All the fishes he could find in the sea he ate with his mouth. Till at last there was only one small fish left in all the sea. And he was a small stute fish. And he swam a little behind the whale's right ear so as to be out of harm's way. And the whale stood up on his tail and said 'I'm hungry.'" "And the small stute fish said, in a small stute voice, 'Noble and generous whale, have you ever tasted man?' 'No, ' the whale said. 'What is it like?' 'Nice, ' said the small stute fish. 'Nice, but nubbly.'" I said to this wee bird the other night. - Right. - "Fancy a fuck and a pizza?" She says, "What?" Here's me, "Do you not like pizza?" You're a dirty dog, Mackers. Busted. - Where? - Corner. Bingo. Make the call. We're just gonna go out for a second. Okay. Yeah, nice and warm. We're just gonna go out this way. Shh, shh, we're just gonna go this way. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Here we go, here we go. Cold? No, we're gonna go this way... Where's your boyfriend? Boyfriend? Tito. Is he in there? I don't know who that is. Wait, Ben, Ben, Ben! Ben! Ben, stop! It's alright, lads. What's going on here? What's going on here is none of your business. If you were wise men, you'd get back in your lorry and fuck the fuck off. But we're not wise men. We're bin men. A bin man. And a fucking cunt. Ben, are you okay? How low can you go? Ben, is that him? Is that the man? Yeah? Yeah? We're gonna run. What are you doing here in the dark? No, leave it off. Sorry, please. Do you want to eat something? No. You should eat. There isn't a pick on you. You look like what's-her-name out of Popeye. Olive Oyl. You look like Olive Oyl. You always had a way of putting things. Always knew how to make me feel great. Just saying. You were such a good mam. - Now you're scaring me. - No, it's true. You were. You were steadfast. That's the word. You weren't much for hugs and kisses. But you were always there. I feel my age. First time I've really begun to feel it. Makes you... What you're going through, I know very little about it. Maybe nothing. When your father died... What did I feel? When we married... ...we were each other's last chance. I wanted a baby and, I don't know, I suppose he wanted sex. Jesus, Mam. But I don't think I ever loved him. I was fond of him maybe at one time, but love? Certainly nothing like you and Stephen. I'm sorry. You're the only person I've ever really loved. And it breaks my crooked old heart. I know, Mam. I know that, Mam. Don't think I don't know. When the cabin portholes are dark and green because of the seas outside. And the ship goes wop with a wiggle between. And the steward falls into the soup tureen. And the trunks begin to slip and slide. When Nursey falls on to the floor in a... Heap. And mummy tells you to let her... Sleep! You aren't waked or washed or... Dressed! Well, then you will know if you haven't... Guessed! Ben, that man... He is never going to hurt us again. Do you hear me? Ben, please look at me. Please. Never. When you are waked or washed or dressed, well, then, you will know if you haven't guessed. You're fifty north and forty... West. Yeah. West. Oh my god. What the fuck? Door was open. - How did you... - The door... was open. Nice photos. You want Tito? Fine, I'll give you Tito. But this is going to end. You have to stay away from me and my children. My children and I. Just tell me where he is! All this dragging of feet is so unnecessary. I will bring him. I will bring him to your place in one hour. Is that so? Now, get the hell out of my house. I'll be waiting. Mam? Mam? Mam! What's wrong? Were you talking to someone? No, no, I was just talking to myself. Myself. Do you come here often, love? Love? Fuck off. After you. Fuck off, Ray. Get in! Where's Reilly? I said! Open... Just open the bag. Yeah? Open the bag. What the fuck? You wanted Tito? Yeah? Yeah? Here he is! She's a fucking psycho. Look at him! What? Fucking look at him! Jesus! Woman! You got some balls, woman! But what? What do you expect? What do you want? Do you even remember my husband's name? What? Do you remember my husband's name? Wha... Who's your husband? Stephen Collins. Say that again. My husband was Stephen Collins. I cut him up! Don't think I won't shoot you. Wait, stop! Get back! Fucking shot me, you bitch! Why did you do it? Fuck you, cunt. Why did you kill my husband? Stuck his nose where it didn't belong, didn't he? I was looking for a guy who owed me money. I found him. Your fella saw us. Tried to play good samaritan, didn't he? Not my favorite Bible story. Stupid fucking story, if you ask me. After I put the word about. The police are like anybody else. Believe what they want to bel... Fuck you, cunt. Fucking bitch. Ah, fuck. Ah, fuck! ...which, according to police sources, bears all the hallmarks of a gangland killing. The triple murder is being linked to the discovery of body parts in a nearby waste recycling center. This, too, would suggest a feud between rival drug-lords and might also suggest paramilitary influence. Ben? Lucy? Ben? Lucy. What have I told you two? Huh? They'll never listen. Come on. Here, must be paying well. Might even be tempted myself. Do you want to pick your favorite chocolate? And one for Lucy too. Now, say "thank you" to the nice man. - Thank you! - What? Thank you! Probably gonna need this at the till. What's your game? You're gonna pay for this. Otherwise I'm gonna walk right over to the office and talk to your Floor Manager and tell him that you flashed your cock at my children. What? What kind of a thing is that to say? Exactly. But he'd never believe you. But would it matter? Come on. This way. Cock!
