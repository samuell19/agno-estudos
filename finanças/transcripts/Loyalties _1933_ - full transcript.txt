- Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes Look at De Levis in his fat Rolls. - Why should we not stop him? - Ronnie! Let him pass. If Captain Dancy wants to break his neck, I can't stop him. Very good, sir. - Hello. - Hello. Hello. I wonder if they're all here yet. Oh, there's Margaret isn't it? - Hello, darling, where are they? - They're all waiting for you. - I shan't be long. - Come on, Ronald. Come on, Ferdie, you're late. We shall miss the first race. Think what a lot of money I've saved you, Margaret. Ronnie, why do you dislike De Levis, it's terribly obvious. - It's a plain fact. - It can't do you any harm. - Oh, there's Lady Adela. - How nice to see you. Good morning to you all. How are you, Lady Adela? Hello, Colford. What's the matter with you and Ronnie Dancy? It's as life becomes mysterious whenever you meet. - He doesn't like me. - Oh, rot. After all, didn't he give you that filly of his, Rosemary? Only because he couldn't afford her keep. I say, won't it be wild if she turns out good? They're off! Come on. - Hello, Kentman. - Oh, De Levis, I've been looking for you. - Excuse me a moment, darling? - Of course I will. Did Gould tell you of my offer to buy Rosemary? - Not enough. - Twenty guineas. You seem pretty keen. Not exactly, but she's coming on. - I'll take your offer. - You mind notes? I don't mind what it is, so long as it's money. A hundred... three fifties... I see that Mr. De Levis is selling your filly to Mr. Kentman, the bookmaker. You gave away a good thing, sir. Cut it out, Colford, it makes me giggle. Haven't you any party tricks, Ferdie? - I'm afraid not. - You ought to learn some. It's grand fun breaking teams. How much do you bet? Oh, I wish Ronnie wouldn't do that trick of his, it's so dangerous. - What is? - Trying to jump onto a bookcase. It's terribly dangerous if you catch your feet. Oh, Ronnie, darling, I wish you wouldn't. - Ronnie, darling! - Oh, shut up, Mabel, it's only four feet. - I can do it on the head. - That's just what I'm afraid of. Oh, don't darling. I shouldn't risk breaking a kneecap if I were you. I shall risk what I like. Look here, I'll bet you ten pounds I do it the first time. Lady Adela, can't you do anything? - I don't want to bet. - Come on, you said I couldn't. - Are you a sportsman? - Of course I'll take you, if you insist. You aren't really going to do it, are you? I bet you twenty-five pounds he won't do it. - Marvelous! - Alley-oop! Alley-oop! Alley-oop! Come on, Ronnie, I think you need a double brandy after that. - Marvelous stunt, eh, Ferdie? - I wouldn't care to do it. Oh, but you don't need a tenner as much as Ronnie does. There is that. My dear, if you don't stop that husband of yours, he'll break his neck before you've been married six months. Nobody will ever stop Ronnie jumping up things. - How about you, General? - I'll have one, thank you. There you are, ten pounds. I wouldn't do it for twenty. You couldn't for fifty. - What will you have, Mr. De Levis? - Nothing at all, thank you. If you don't mind, Lady Adela, I think I'll get off to bed. Oh, so soon? Good night. - Good night. - Good night, Ferdie. Good night, Margaret, good night, Mrs. Dancy. Good night, De Levis. Got everything you want? Yes, thank you. Now, then. How about a little drink for me? Do you think that tenner must have cost him a pain? Him, the Israelite. Grinning while we make fools of ourselves, what? Adela, darling, on to bed. - How about you, Mabel? - Hm, I think so. Let's all go. - Good night, Ronnie. - Good night. Good night, Major. - Good night, Ronnie. - Good night, General. Good night, Dancy. - Good night, General. - Good night, ladies. Good night, you fellows. There's a switch here, whoever's last up. Here you are, old man. Damn, I... I left my book in the billiard. - Good night, Mabel. - Good night. - Good night, Lady Adela. - Good night, darling. - Sleep well. - Good night, Charles. Good night, Meg. - Good night, Mabel. - Good night, Lady Adela. Sleep well, darling. - Me too? - Hm! - I'm tired, don't be long. - All right, dear. - Not in bed yet? - Waiting for you. Ronnie Dancy's on his uppers again, I'm afraid. When a chap takes to doing parlor tricks for a bet. I hated to see him get that money from De Levis. Not half as much as De Levis hated paying it. - The young Jew. - Isn't that rather prejudiced? Not a bit. I like Jews. But he pushes himself. The general tells me he's definitely keen to get on the committee of the Jockey Club. It's amusing to see De Levis trying to get round the general, an old Lord St. Erth. Well, if Lord St. Erth and General Canynge back him, - he's getting in even if he sold carpets. - Funny you should say that. His father did sell carpets wholesale in the city. How's that for a woman's intuition? Ronnie. Ronnie. You've not gone to bed yet? - No, I'm just paying a few bills. - Lucky dog. Good night. Good night. Come in. Hello, De Levis, anything I can do for you? Awfully sorry, Winsor. Thought I'd better tell you at once. I've just had... rather a lot of money stolen. - What? - How do you mean? Tell us. I put it under my pillow and went to take a bath. When I came back, it was gone. - How much? - Nearly a thousand. - A thousand? - Yes. I sold my filly Rosemary to Kentman on the course today and he paid me in notes. Rosemary, that wee dunce he gave you in the spring? Yes, to save her keep. But I tried her pretty high the other day... ...and kept in-running her in Cambridgeshire I was only out of my room for a quarter of an hour. And I locked my door. - You locked? - Yes, and have the key here. Look here. It's been stuffed with paper or something. This is damned awkward, De Levis. Yes. - I should like it back. - Have you got the numbers of the notes? - No. - What were they? One hundred, three fifties and the rest in smaller notes. - We ought to do something. - It will make the devil of a scandal. Who's in the room next to me? Mr. De Levis, really. Dancy and his wife are on this side, and Margaret Orme on the other. - Are you suggesting... - They may have heard something. Oh, yes, of course. Let's go and see. But Dancy was downstairs when I came up. What do you want us to do? I think the police ought to see my room. - The police? - It's a lot of money. Good Lord. There would be a policeman nearer than Newmarket. Better telephone them, Adela. That is, if you really want the police, De Levis. - Yes, I do. - Very well, then. Let's go and get the General and consult him. We shall probably want Treisure. Ring for him Adela, on your way. All right. Did anyone know you had all that money? - No. - Where did Kentman pay you? - Just outside the paddock. - Anybody about? Nobody suspicious. You must have been marked down and followed here. - You rang, sir? - Who's valetting Mr. De Levis? - Robert, sir. - Look here, Treisure. Mr. De Levis has had a large sum of money... ...taken from his bedroom in the last half hour. - Indeed, sir? - Robert's quite all right, isn't he? - He is, sir. - How do you know? I'm a pretty good judge of character, sir, if you'll excuse me. It seems to have happened between 11:15 and 11:30, is that right? - Yes. - What was Mr. De Levis doing out of his room? - If I may ask, sir. - Having a bath. With his door locked and the key in his pocket. - Thank you, sir. - Damn it, what do you mean? - I was. - I beg your pardon, sir. Look here, Treisure. It's infernally awkward for everybody. It is, sir. In the interest of the staff, might I suggest a call down and a complete search? Ah, here's the General. Well, General, did Adela tell you? What's the first move? Mr. De Levis' press is the matter. Unless you think it too plebeian of me, General Canynge, a thousand pounds. That's so. Then we must wait for the police, Winsor. I presume Lady Adela has got through to them by now. What... what height are these rooms from the ground, Treisure? - Twenty-five feet from the terrace. - Any ladders near? There's one near the stable, sir, very heavy. Slip down and see whether it's been moved, will you? Very good, General. Of course he, er... - I suppose you're quite sure of him. - I am. You'd better leave this in our hands, De Levis. - Certainly, only the way he... - Treisure's been here since he was a boy. I should as soon suspect myself. But you seem to think... Well, what was I to do? Take it lying down and let whoever it was get clear off? I suppose it's natural to want my money back. Of course, De Levis. Perhaps you'll call me when the police arrive. - Did you ever see such a dressing gown? - Never. - Oh, Adela. - Yes? Isn't this gorgeous! Poor little Ferdie. What time did you come to bed, Meg? Oh, I suspect a child. How thrilling. - Did you hear anything from your room? - Only for Ferdie splashing in the bathroom. - And saw nothing? - Not even that, alas. - I told the Dancys thereafter. - Good. - Let's hear what they've got to say. - Oh, and I telephoned the police. An Inspector called Jones is coming like the wind on a motorcycle. - Do you think they like the wind? - Yes, darling. What an imagination. - Mabel, have you heard? - Yes, I... I'm awfully sorry to disturb you, Mabel, but I suppose you and Ronnie didn't hear anything suspicious? Ronnie's only just come up. I heard the rain before I fell asleep. Yes, it has just stopped. What time did he say the money was taken? Between a quarter and half-past. He locked the door and had the key with him. How quaint. Just like an hotel. - Does he put his boots out? - Oh, don't be naughty, Meg. Um, by the way, Dancy, when exactly did you come up? Oh, about ten minutes ago. I followed Colford up after writing a letter. By the way, oughtn't the grounds to be searched or something? - That's for the police. - Devil, are they coming? Shh! Here comes the wind. Confounded De Levis. Oh, that's all very well, but what would any of us have done if we'd been in his shoes? A thousand pounds? I can't even conceive having it. We should not have wanted the police. Oh, that's it. The hotel touch again. Well, General, what's next? You and I had better take the inspector to De Levis' room, Winsor. Ah, there he is. Good evening, sir. This gentleman's lost a lot of money, I understand. - Only a thousand pounds. - It doesn't seem much to you. Oh, to me, yes. Are you sure you haven't given it as a tip to somebody? Please, please, you two. Will you all remain at hand in case the inspector... ...wants to put any questions to you. I hope he'll want me. This is too thrilling. - Come on, Mabel. - Don't be so naughty, Meg. - Wait in the hall, Roberts. - Very good, sir. We must be careful with this inspector fellow. If he pitches on anyone in the house, it'll be very disagreeable. - By Jove, it will. - Hm. Oh, darling, wasn't Rosemary the mare you gave De Levis for nothing? - Hm-hmm. - Now he's sold her for a thousand pounds. What beastly luck, when mother needed a thousand pounds so badly. Poor sweet, it's a shame. - Now, sir, what time did you come up? - About eleven. Precise, if you can give it me. I know it was 11:15 when I put my watch under my pillow and I'd been about, er... ...a quarter of an hour undressing. Just undressing. - You didn't look over your betting book? - No. - No prayers or anything? - No. Pretty swift about your undressing as a rule? Yes... oh, say about five past eleven. Now, sir, I should like to see your butler and the footman that valets this gentleman. Vey well, Inspector. Only my butler's been with us from a boy. Quite so. Just clearing the grounds. Now, sir, did you open the window or was it open when you first came in? - I opened it. - Drawing the curtains back first? Yes. Are you sure there was nobody in the room already? I hadn't thought of it. I didn't look under the bed, if that's what you mean. Did not look under bed. Did you look under it after the theft? No, I did not. - Who was on this side, sir? - Miss Orme, she was in her room. - In the other? - Captain Dancy, he was downstairs. I'd just like the keys of their doors. In fact, all the keys. My man will get them. Go and get me all them keys, do you hear? Damn De Levis and his money. It's a deuce his invidious disposition, General. - You valet Mr. De Levis, I think. - Yes, sir. What time did you take his clothes and boots? - Ten o'clock, sir. - Did you happen to look under his bed? Me, sir? No, sir. I never do. Did you come up again to bring the clothes back? No, sir, they're still downstairs. - Did you come up again for anything? - No, sir. - What time did you go to bed? - Just after eleven. - Did you go to bed at all? - No, sir. Then why did you say you did? Anything you say may be used against you. - Yes, sir. I mean, I went to my room. - Where is your room? On the ground floor on the other end of the right wing. Excuse me, sir. Damned De Levis and his money. The inspectors know Erth. Well, Mr. Winsor, I've formed my theory. The thief walked in before the door was locked, probably during dinner. and was under bed. He escaped by dropping from balcony. The creeper in front has been violently wrenched. I'll go down and examine the grounds and see you again, sir. Well, De Levis, what else do you want done? Nothing. I know who took my money. The deuce you do. Are you following the inspector's theory? That ass! No. The man who put those papers there... ...was clever and cool enough to wrench the creeper off the balcony as a blind. And look here, General. It's about seven feet between these two balconies. You don't suggest... If a man can jump onto a narrow bookcase four feet high and balance there, he'd think nothing of that. And look here. Someone stood on that. The stalk's crushed. That's where he'd naturally stand when he took the jump back. This is an extraordinary insinuation. - Accusation. - What? I have intuitions, General. It's in my blood. This is outrageous, De Levis. Dancy says he was downstairs all the time. If he'll return the notes and apologize, I'll do nothing. Except cut him in future. It's mad, sir, to jump to conclusions like this. Not so mad as the conclusion Dancy jumped to when he landed on my balcony. Nobody could have taken the money who didn't know you had it. - How do you know he didn't? - Do you know that he did? - I haven't the least doubt of it. - Without any proof. This is very ugly, Mr. De Levis. I must tell Dancy. You can tell the whole bloody lot. You think I've no feelings. But I've felt the atmosphere here, I can tell you, General. If I were in Dancy's shoes and he in mine, your tone would be very different. This is a private house, Mr. De Levis. I suggest that something is due to our host, and to the... esprit de corps that exists among gentlemen. Since when was a thief a gentleman? As thick as thieves, a good motto, isn't it? That's enough! Really, De Levis, is this the way you repay hospitality? Hospitality? That skins my feelings and costs me a thousand pounds? Winsor. Go and get Dancy, but don't say anything to him. Mr. De Levis, Captain Dancy has a fine record as a soldier. If he's as innocent as Christ, we might as well stick to him unless the real thief is found. - He is the thief. - If you persist in this absurd accusation, you will both of you go out of this room dead in the eyes of society. You for bringing it, he for being the object of it. Society! Do you think I don't know that I'm only tolerated for my money? Society can't add injury to insult, that's all. If the notes are restored, I'll keep my mouth shut. If they are not, I shall not. Upon my soul, Mr. De Levis, you go too far. Not so far as I shall go, General Canynge, if those notes are given back. Oh, um... look here, Dancy. The whole thing turns on whether anyone knew that De Levis had this money. It's about that we rather wanted to consult you. De Levis said Kentman paid him on the way to the paddock. Did you hear anything that throws light, Dancy? As it was your filly, we thought that perhaps you might. I? No. Didn't hear anything of the sale on the course, I suppose? No. Then you can't suggest anyone who could have known. De Levis is known to be rolling, sir, just as I am to be stalling. There are a good many people still rolling besides Mr. De Levis. But not many who carry so large a sum in their pocketbook. But he won two races. Do you suggest I bet in ready money? I don't know how you bet and I don't care. - Then you can't help us. - No, I can't. - Anything else? - Nothing else, thank you, Dancy. You see, De Levis, he didn't even know you got the money. Very conclusive. Well, really. I'm just going, gentlemen. The grounds I'm sorry to say have yielded nothing. It's a bit of a puzzle. You'll take it up from the other end then, Inspector? Well, we'll see what we can do with the bookmakers about the numbers of the notes, but it's come and go with them, I doubt if they'll have them. Before I go, gentlemen. There's no one you suspect in the house, I suppose? No, certainly not, Inspector. Very well, I'll say good night to you gentlemen. - Good night, Inspector. - Good night. Look here, we must stop De Levis's tongue. They may never find the real thief. It's the very devil for Dancy. General, we must do as we would be done by. It hits us all, the thing's intolerable. I agree. Intolerable. Mr. De Levis. This insinuation of yours against young Dancy is pure supposition. And you must not make it. Do you understand me? My tongue is still mine, General... if my money isn't. You must not, do you hear? You are already a member of one rather exclusive club... ...and now I understand that you wish to be nominated for the Jockey Club. Lord St. Erth and I can doubtless arrange the matter. Have we your word to say nothing? Social blackmail. Not at all, simple warning. Make up your mind. I'm not a fool, General. I know perfectly well that you can get me outed. Well? - I'll say nothing. - Good. Unless I get more proof. We have implicit faith in Dancy. And that put stray to that, I hope. Winsor. Dancy's sleeve was damp, and it's been raining. A minute out and it would have been enough. He must have been out in his balcony since. It stopped raining by the time I reached my room, half an hour ago. He'd be leaning on the wet stone then. With the upside of the upper part of the arm? Against the wall, perhaps. There may be a dozen explanations. I absolutely refuse to believe anything of this sort against Ronald Dancy. General, will the Jockey Club people let De Levis in? I hope so. Bunk! Anything for me, Jenkins? Nothing much, I'm afraid, sir. Ah, the very man. Hi, Dancy. Do you know about that mare of Kentman's? What are her chances? I have no idea, sir. Isn't that the horse he gave away to young De Levis? Who promptly sold for a thousand. I don't fancy our chances. A clever Jew that. Hm, clever Jews make mistakes sometimes, when it's a case of hard cash. I hear you fellows are letting him in to the Jockey Club. Wait and see. We must draw the line somewhere. But he's bound to be nominated if General Canynge backs him. - By the by, where is the General? - Playing cards with old Lord St. Erth. That m-makes the r-r-rubber. I never undrstand this damned contract. Why can't we play the old game? No go, I'm afraid. The younger men won't look at it. Excuse me, I'm going to see if there's anything on the t-t-table. Look here, St. Erth, couldn't tell you in front of that fellow Borring. The Jockey Club people have asked me not to go on with De Levis's nomination. Hm, that'll make him wild. I ain't surprised. Damned if I know why you asked them to bother about him. I had very good reasons. I left a note for De Levis with the porter. General Canynge asked me to let you have this the moment you came in, sir. Thank you. - Oh, h-h-hello. - Hello. - Are you through yet? - Not yet, sir. What do you p-p-propose backing? That horse De Levis sold to Kentman, I shall make a packet. Hello, they're off. - Here it is. - R-O... Rosemary. - Rosemary's won it. - Sherwood's second. By Jove, De Levis, don't you wish you'd given Kentman back his money? Unfortunately, your friend the gallant Captain Dancy, has made that impossible. What do you mean? I got the money but I wasn't allowed to keep it. Are you saying Dancy robbed you that money? - Who else? - My God, for two pins I'd... Steady, Major Colford, this is a committee matter. General! Yes, Colford? Sorry to interrupt you, Lord St. Erth, but this matter simply won't wait. - De Levis has started a blasphemous story... - Um, Borring... What's the use, General, half the club will know it by now. De Levis is saying that Ronald Dancy robbed him down at your place, Winsor. Is Dancy in the club? Yes, sir, if he hadn't been, I'd have taken it on myself to wring the bounder's neck. You'd better warn De Levis. He'll have to account to the committee for making such a statement... ...against a fellow member of the club. Four of us are here and form a quorum. De Levis, the committee want to see you. Well, General Canynge. It'a a little too strong all this. A little too strong. It is quite obvious, Mr. De Levis, that you and Captain Dancy both remain members of this club. We must ask for explanations before requesting one resignation or the other. You've let me down. What? Well, I shall tell people that you and Lord St. Erth supported me for the Jockey Club... ...and now you're asking me to resign from this place. You seem a venomous young man. I'll tell you what is venomous, Milord. Chasing a man like a pack of hounds because he isn't of your breed. You appear to have your breed on the brain, sir. No one else does, as far as I know. Suppose I had robbed Dancy. Would you have chased him out for complaining of it? My God, if you repeat that! You say Dancy stole your money in my house on no proof. No proof. Yet you expect Dancy's friends to treat you as if you were a gentleman. That's too strong if you like. No proof! Kentman says he told Gould in Newmarket of the sale... and Gould says he himself told it to Dancy. Well, if he did? Dancy says he didn't know of it in General Canynge's presence and mine. You can't deny that if you want to. Choose your expressions more carefully, De Levis. Proof! Did they find any footmarks in the ground below that torn creeper? Not a sign. You saw how he can jump. He won ten pounds from me that same evening betting on a certainty. That's your Dancy, a common sharper! Colford, go and find Dancy. And Borring, use your tact to keep people quiet. You can think yourself damn lucky if he doesn't break your neck. Set some more coal on. I quite understand. I marked for coventry now, what ever happens. Well, I'll take Dancy with me. Are you going to retract and apologize in front of Dancy... - ...and the members who've heard you? - No fear. You must be a very rich man, sir. - The courts of law require proof. - Correct. He can make it a criminal libel action. You'll find yourself in a difficult position unless you stop it at once. If you can stop it, that is. If I were young Dancy, nothing would induce me. Ah, but you didn't steal my money, Lord St. Erth. You seem deucy positive, sir. Confront me with Dancy and give me fair play. Captain Dancy, a serious accusation is being made against you by this gentleman. What is it? That you robbed him of money at Winsor's. Indeed? On what grounds is he good enough to say that? You gave me that filly to save yourself her keep... ...and you've been mad about it ever since. You knew from Gould that I'd sold her to Kentman and been paid in cash... ...and yet I heard you deny that you knew it. You had the room next to me and you can jump like a cat as we saw that same evening. I found some creeper crushed by weight on the balcony on my side. When I went to the bathroom, your door was open. When I came back, it was shut. That's the first we've heard about the door. I remembered it afterwards. Well, Dancy. I'll settle this matter with any weapon, when and where he likes. It can't be settled that way, you know very well. It must be taken to the courts unless he retracts. - Will you retract? - Not I! Why did you tell General Canynge you didn't know Kentman had paid me in cash? - Because I did not know. - So Gould lied for no reason? That has nothing to do with me. If you were downstairs all the time as you say, why was your door open and then shut? Being downstairs how should I know? The wind probably. I should like to hear what your wife has to say about that. Leave my wife alone... you damned Jew! Captain Dancy! Thief! - Will you fight? - You're very smart! Dead men tell no tales. No! Bring your action. We shall see. That will do, gentlemen. Mr. De Levis, we won't keep you. Kindly consider your membership suspended until the matter has been thrashed out. Don't trouble yourself about my membership. I resign it. You called me a damned Jew. My race was old when you were all savages. I am proud to be a Jew. Au revoir... in the courts. Well, Captain Dancy, this concerns the honor of the club. Are you going to take action? That's a very expensive business, Lord St. Erth. Well, I'm hard up. I shall have to think it over. Do I take it there's a doubt in your minds, gentlemen? No. That's not the point, Dancy. This will be all over the club. And if you don't take action, judgment will naturally go by default. I might prefer to treat the whole matter as beneath contempt. Well, old man, did you put it across him? - What's he done, Logan? - It's that fellow De Levis. - I don't like it. - It's perfectly damnable for him. More damnable if he did it, Winsor. Of course he'll bring a case when he's thought it over. What will be of his position even if he wins? Th-th-the damages and the stain on his character. Quite so, there is no decent way out of a thing like this. He didn't do it. But even if he did, I'd stick to him and see him through it if I could. It leaves a bad taste. I'm sorry for young Mrs. Dancy, poor woman. Good luck, Dancy, old chap. Could I get you a taxi, sir? Good luck, sir. But it's... it's monstruous. Ronnie hasn't said a word to me. Yesterday afternoon at the club, did you say? My dear, he probably didn't want you bothered. You mustn't expect a desperate character like Ronnie to be exactly communicative. Ronnie, desperate? Gracious, wives are at a disadvantage. - Especially early on. - That beast De Levis. I was in our room next door the whole time. Was the door into Ronnie's room open? I don't know, I think it was. Well, you can say so in court. Not that it matters. Wives are liars by law. Court? My dear, there will be a libel action. Defamation of character or whatever they call it. But it's terrible. I simply can't believe it. If there's a case, will it be all right afterwards? It sticks. There's not the slightest connection as far as I can see... ...between innocence and reputation. Look at me. - Goodbye, Lady Adela. - Goodbye, darling. We'll fight this, tooth and nail. Mabel. General Canynge was here last night. You don't mind ifr I'm beastly frank, do you? No, why should I? Well, he is all for us going to court on it. - But he's awfully silent and worried. - I hate half-hearted friends. Loyalty comes before everything. Yes, but loyalties cut up against each other sometimes, you know. Oh... I must go back to the flat and find Ronnie. Oh, I can go by myself. We're only two floors up. Oh, thank you, thank you both. - Goodbye, darling. - Goodbye. Poor kid. - Coffee? - No, thanks. - Adela. - Yes? - Have you ever given evidence? - Never. It must be rather fun. All the same. - Don't you feel you couldn't? - Couldn't what? Stand for De Levis against one of us, even if he were right. - That's narrow, Meg. - I know lots of splendid Jews. I like Ferdie. But when it comes to the point to paste to each other, why shouldn't we? - It's in the blood. - Prejudice, Meg. Or are they loyalties? I don't know. Meg, you don't really think Ronnie Dancy... I don't know, Adela. There are some people who can't live without danger. He's had a past, you know. And then, of course, right up to his marriage a few weeks ago. Oh, do tell! A foreign-looking girl, most plummy. Oh, Ronnie's got charm. That Mabel child doesn't in the least know what she's got hold of. Ronnie! Ronnie! Ronnie! - Your husband, Mrs. Dancy? - He's not in. - Why do you want to see him? - He called at my rooms this morning. I was out. Yesterday at the club he, um... He threatened me. I... I don't want him to think I'm afraid of him. Oh, I... I must speak too. Please come in. Oh, thank you. Mr. De Levis, you're robbing my husband his good name. Naturally you trust your husband, Mrs. Dancy. But you can't possibly believe that he's a thief. - Unfortunately... - Don't you know that I was in our room... ...next door the whole time with the door open? - Do you accuse me too? - No. But you do. I must have seen, I must have heard. A wife's memory isn't very good, Mrs. Dancy... when her husband is in danger. - In other words I'm lying. - No. Your wish is mother to your thought, that's all. Mr. De Levis, I appeal to you as a gentleman. Mrs. Dancy, according to your husband, I'm not a gentleman. I'm only a damned Jew. Yesterday I might have withdrawn to spare you. But when my race is insulted. I have nothing to say to your husband, Mrs. Dancy. And since he wanted to see me, I'm here. Will you please tell him that I called? I think what you're doing is too horrible for words. Oh! De Levis is here. You wanted to see me? Yes. To sign this. - I shall sign nothing. - Wait till I read it. I apologize to Captain Dancy for a monstrous charge I made against him. And I withdraw every word of it. - Not much. - You will sign! I tell you it's quite useless, I shall sign nothing. The charge is true. - Mabel, I want to speak to him alone. - Oh, no! Quite right. Mrs. Dancy, swashbuckling will only make things worse. You'd shelter behind a woman, would you? Don't, Ronnie, he's not worth it. Get out of here, you swine! He's hurt you awfully, I know. Look here, Mabel. This is a ghastly, tame-cat sort of life. Let's cut it and get to Africa. I can scrape up enough money for that. - But can we? Everybody would say that... - Let them, we shan't be here. - I couldn't bear people to think... - Oh, I don't care what people think. Besides, if I bring an action and get damages, it's all no good, I can't prove anything. I couldn't. It looks like running away. Suppose I don't get a verdict. You never can tell. But you will. I was there all the time with the door open. - Was it? - I'm almost sure. Hm... you're my wife. Ronnie, I don't understand. Imagine if I'd been accused of stealing. I can't. I might just as easily. What would you think if I ran away from it? I see. All right, I suppose I'd better go and see old Twisden and a lawyer. - Let me come. - No. Why not? I'm not happy a moment unless I'm fighting this. Oh, you are, little brick. Ronnie, you didn't! I'd rather know. - I thought that suspicion was coming. - Oh, how horrible of me, how horrible! Not a bit. The thing looks bad. But if I can't believe in you, who can? In spite of all the world, I'd believe in you. - Well, what are we going to do? - Let's go to that lawyer. Let's go at once! All right, you shall have a run for your money. I'll fight the case. Very funny that Inspector, no less the Lord Chief of Justice... Good morning. In your case you say that no one told you of the sale of the horse... ...at Newmarket on that day. That is so, Milord. Consequently you could not have known that Mr. De Levis... ...had so large a sum of money in his possession. No, Milord. Very well. Mr. De Levis. Your sole object to making this accusation... ...was to get your money back. Yes. No personal, or, um... Or, forgive me, shall we say... ...racial antagonisms? Captain Dancy is not the type of man to be prejudiced in favor of a Jew. Mr. Trisden, have you noticed there are two of the chosen race on the jury? Don't you think they ought to have been challenged? De Levis might have challenged the other ten, Margaret. Yes, I never thought of that. - William Gould. - William Gould. William Gould. Now, Mr. Gould, in spite of Capt. Dancy's denial, you still say that you told him of the sale that day on the race course? Yes, sir. And he made no comment? Nothing at all. Very important information, wasn't it? I suppose you put him on one side, where you wouldn't be disturbed giving this news? - No, sir, just in passing. - Ah, just in passing! Exactly. And he said nothing. He said, "Oh!", or something like that. - Nothing more than that? - No, Milord. I see. So you would not swear solemnly... ...that he was aware of the importance of what you told him. Only that you murmered something to him in the crowd and he passed on. - Is that it? - Yes, sir. That is all, thank you. Very well. Sir Frederic's on top of his form. It'll be too frightful if Ronnie doesn't get the verdict after all this. The stolen notes have been circulated in the press, I understand. Um, certain of them, yes, Milord. That is to say, the hundred pound note and the three fifties. Nothing has come to light? They were only circulated this morning, Milord. Very well. I shall adjourn until ten minutes past two. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. Will you kindly be in your places at ten minutes past two. We'll apply for a stay and we'll appeal. All the same these society cases. Well, so far so good. Of course the best thing would be if the actual thief were found. - Sir Frederic's doing well. - Yes. Oh! Rather awkward that. - Come on, let's all go to lunch. - You take Ronnie. I think I'll go for a little peace and quiet. Stunning case, isn't it, dear? Cheer up, darling. Mr. Twisden, is he going to win? Not much chance, my dear. If only those notes were chased. Ma chi sono portata? Never mind your Italian. Where did you get it, that's the point. Mr. Gilman, you know me, I'm an honorable man. I can't tell you that, but I'm above the board. That's all very well, but here I've got the stolen note... ...and you've got the value for it. Well, I'm a careful man. I've never been mixed up with the law before and I'm not going to be now. I tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going straight with this note to Mr. Jacob Trisden. He's got this here society case in hand. Oh, that is what you do, uh? Then I come too. I'd like to something to help this Capt. Dancy, poor young man. I thought he gave his evidence well. Looks to me as if this De Levis has got some private spite. I'm sure she loves him. Thank you. Everybody's on our side. You'll win hands down. I tried to get something out of him on the way here. But I couldn't, I could not. This is very awkward, I said at last. It is, Mr. Gilman, was his reply. Then he began to talk about his Sicilian character. A very good one, mind you. But under the circumstances, it seemed to me to be uncalled for. - Have I made it clear to you? - Perfectly, Mr. Gilman. Ah, there you are, Mr. Trisdale, I've been looking for you. You're just in time, Graviter. There's a man named Ricardos outside in the corridor. - Just bring him in, will you? - You can't mistake him, Italian. Foreign-looking, but nothing more. He's one of my best customers. I've taken interest in this case because, to tell you the truth, I don't like... Well, not to put too fine a point on it, Hebrews. They work harder, they're more sober, they're honest, and they're everywhere. I've got nothing against them, mind, but the fact is... ...they get on so. It's all in the flesh, eh, Mr. Gilman? Well, I prefer my own countrymen, that's the truth of it. - Er... Mr. Ricardos? - Yes, sir. Mr. Gilman, your conduct has been most prompt. You may safely leave matters in our hands now. Oh, then I suppose there's nothing else I ought to do in the interest of the law? I'm a careful man. But, er... don't speak of this. It might interfere with justice. Oh, I shouldn't dream of it. I've no wish to be mixed up in anything conspicuous. That's not my principal at all. - Well, good day, gentlemen. - Good day, sir. Come, sir, speak out. Sir, the note's for settlement on my daughter... ...from gentleman of whom she was great friend. What was his name? Oh, sir, this very painful for me. It's my daughter's honor. Oh, he behaved well. Now we betray him, perhaps. Who knows, hm? Oh, this very unpleasant for me. Here. Here is number of another note. I have that one. How much did he give you in all? For my daughter's settlement, one thousand pounds. - When was this? - The middle of October last. Mr. Ricardos, was it Capt. Dancy? Oh, sir, I trust you. Were you blackmailing him? Oh, sir, I'm very fond of my daughter. I think it is my duty to ask Capt. Dancy to make some recompense for her. - With threats that you would tell his wife? - Oh, sir, I trusted him. He gave me the money for her. I don't know where he got it from. I don't know. But Capt. Dancy is a man of honor. Ah. - Oughtn't we to go? - No need to be there for the opening. Here's to the verdict. - We can't go on with the case. - Gosh! Think what it will mean to his wife. They've only been married a month or two. It's a question of loyalty to Sir Frederic. We can't let him go on in the dark. Complete confidence between solicitor and counsel is a question of professional order. His wife believes in him implicitly. No, no, no, no, it's breaking faith. You'd better try and find Dancy. Where does he lunch? Goodness knows. I expect he'll be on his way back by now anyway. I'll stay here and catch Sir Frederic as he comes into court. Nothing else for him. Impossible to go on in face of this now. Jury is just coming in, sir. - Well? - Can't find him anywhere. This is a dreadful thing, Trisden. What on earth got into him? There's no end to human nature, General. You'd better go into court, Graviter, in case there's anything you can do. I'll help in the court. They need your help very badly. He must be off his head at the moment. Damn job, crazy! You'd have a verdict on that alone if the jury had seen those balconies. Daring thing, Twisden. Very few men on a dark night... Young De Levis is shrewd. He spotted Dancy's nature. Yes, Sir Frederic? Milord, I... I have a statement to make. Since the publication of the number of the notes, information has reached me, which I regret to say, leaves me no alternative but to withdraw the case. Silence, please. Silence. Silence, please. Is the plaintiff in court? No, Milord. In that case, judgment for the defendant with costs. Next case. Jones v. Jackson. - Quite a story. - Where's the blower? - What's happening? - Sir Frederic struck up the case. - Formal verdict for De Levis was brought. - Good God! They found the stolen notes. The missing notes were brought to me during the luncheon interval... ...by a man named Ricardos. Consequently, Sir Frederic has refused to go on with the case. Is there any need for me to say more? No, not now. The police may issue a warrant. In any case, you must leave the country. You can't save your honor, that's gone. You can't save your wife's peace of mind. If she sticks to you. Do you think she will? Not if she has any sense. Let her go. There's a war on in China. Ha, good old China! Will you go then at once and leave me to break it to your wife? - I don't know yet. - You must decide quickly... ...and catch the boat in. Many a man has made good. You're a fine soldier. There are alternatives. No, go straight from here and we'll see what we can do to delay proceedings. That's damn kind of you, but I must think of my wife first. Give me a few moments. - There must be some mistake, Mr. Twisden. - He's in there. - He's admitted it. - What? Well, guilty or not, you ought to have stuck to him. Major Colford, when you have been as long in your profession as I have been in mine, you will know that loyalty to your calling outweighs loyalty to friend or client. - But I serve the country! - And I serve the law, sir. Mr. Twisden, pay De Levis. You know my pearls, put them on the spot again, but don't let Ronnie... Money isn't the point, Margaret. Poor little Mabel Dancy. It's perfect hell for her. It is! It's no good, Colie. Oh, clear out, the lot of you! I can't stand comiseration! Well? I'm going home clear things up with my wife. General Canynge, I don't quite know why I did the damn thing, but I did and there's an end of it. Dancy, for the honor of the Army, avoid public scandal if you can. I'm writing a letter to a friend of mine in the Japanese War Office. It should get you a job. That's very kind of you, sir, but I don't know that I should use it. Goodbye, sir. Ronnie! - Don't they want me in court? - No. What is it then? Why are you back? - It spun. - What spun? The case. They found out through those notes. Oh. Who? - Me. - Oh... Oh, don't, Ronnie, don't! It's a pity you didn't come to Africa three months ago. Oh, why didn't you tell me then? I would have gone. You wanted this case. Well, it's fallen down. Oh, why didn't I face it? But I couldn't. I had to believe. And now you can't. The end, Mabel. Forgive me! Yes... oh, yes. I think I've known a long time really. Only why? What made you? Oh, it was a crazy thing to do. But damn it, I was only looting a looter! The money was as much mine as his. Any decent chap would have offered me half. That wasn't a bad jump twice over. I rather enjoyed that evening. But money, to keep it. Well, I had a debt to pay. To a woman? Oh, Ronnie, don't lie any more. I wanted to save you from knowing. I had a letter from her father that morning threatening to tell you. All the same, if it hadn't been for that little tike leering... ...at me for my parlor tricks. Oh, what's the good of all this now. Well, it'll cure you of loving me. Get over that, Mabs. I never was worth it. Now I'm done for. And the woman... have you... since? No. If you'd known I was tied up with someone else, you'd never have married me. - They want me to run for it. - Run for it? - Why? - I'm a thief, Mabel. There's to be a warrant out. Prosecution? Prison? Oh, go! - Blast them! - Oh, Ronnie, please! I'll pack for you. No, don't wait to pack anything. Have you got money? - It's goodbye, dear Mabel. - No, I'll follow. I'll come out to you there. - Do you mean you'll stick to me? - Of course I'll stick to you! - What's that? - Steady, Mabs, steady! Go and see who it is. Oh... Ronnie! It's Mr. De Levis. You've come to gloat, have you? I came to tell you that I overheard. A warrant has been issued. I want you to realize that it's not my doing and I'll give it no support. I'm content. I don't want my money. I don't even want costs. Dancy, don't you understand? You must get away while there's time. Oh, thank you, Mr. De Levis, thank you. It's too late, Mabel. I can see it. It's the police. Oh, Ronnie, I can't bear it. Heads up, Mabs. Don't show the brutes. Whatever happens, if it's prison, I'll wait. I don't care what you did, I don't care. I'll be just the same when you come back to me. That's not in human nature. It is... it's in me. Get De Levis to hold them in check for a little. - I want a minute. - Ronnie. Ronnie, it won't be for long. I swear it. Mabs... Mabs! Now. No. By God, no! - Yes? - Is Capt. Dancy in, madam? - I'm not quite sure. - Stay there, Constable. - Now, madam. - He's not here, Inspector. He's gone out. I advise you to keep out of this now, sir, it'll be the worse for you. Why do you want, Inspector? Madam, I'm exceedingly sorry, but I have a warrant for his arrest. Inspector! I assure you my sympathy, madam, but I must carry out my instructions. Just half an hour, won't you? It's two lives, two whole lives. We've only been married four months. Come back in half an hour. Nobody will know, nobody. - Won't you? - Madam, you must know my duty. Inspector, I beseech you, just half an hour. No, no, don't you try it. I'm sorry for you, but don't you try it. It's locked. Come now. Who's that out there, Constable? Stand back, Constable, don't let anybody come in. Ronnie! Ronnie! Ronnie! This is only another jump. The only decent thing I can do. Look after her for me, Colford. My love to her and you. - If there's anything I can do. - You drove him to this, damn you! What made you? They attack our race... and so. Loyalties. Aren't they what we all live by? - Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
