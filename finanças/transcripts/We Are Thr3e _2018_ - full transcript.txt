- Nacho? - Yeah? - Can you take a picture of us? - Sure. - One more. - Okay. - There we go. - Thanks. Let's see. That was great. Did the photo come out well? The first was a little blurry, that's why I took another one. Just in case. Great. Are you Sol's friend? Something like that. I'm her ex. Oh, okay. Very modern. Sol says I don't have a social life. She says I work too hard. But we're both free to do what we like. Are you sure? You wouldn't care if a guy started talking to her today? Yes, it would bother me. But we agreed to get on with our lives already. What about you? Are you her friend? No. I came here with Ramiro and Luciana. - They work with her. - I see. We met again some time ago. We were school friends. She invited me with that excuse. To meet new people, have some fun... You wouldn't have liked to stay at home...? Watching a good series and drinking coffee? It's always a plan. I prefer tea because coffee keeps me awake and makes me want to smoke. What about alcohol? - I want a cigarette. - So do I. I was putting it off. - Right. - So, what do you do? - I'm a web designer. - I see. What about you? I work at a bank. Accounts executive. So do you work for an agency? No, I'm my own boss. I've just started. I did a year-long course and that was it. Right. Designing must be hard. You have to get your own clients, charge them, all that. Yeah, I have to struggle with standardized alternatives, but some people still prefer a human touch, so I reach out to them and it all goes well. - Want another drink? - Okay. - The bar's over there. - Okay. It seems that Sol did it very well this month. Yeah. I don't know. - Hey. - Hi. - Hey, guys. How are you? - Good, you? Good. What will it be? I was drinking soda, I hadn't seen this. I'll have a beer. Soda, beer. How disappointing. What's the matter? How long have you been married? No, I'm divorced. But not from him. I just met him. I just know I can't mix drinks. - Right. - Divorced? Yeah, two years ago. Want me to prepare something for you? Alright. A love potion. I don't know your name. I'm Juan Ignacio. Nacho. - Ana. - It's a pleasure. - Likewise. - Sebastián. Hey. - So... - That's a lot of stuff in that drink. Yeah, it has a few. How did you get here? I drove here, so don't make anything too strong, because then, I'll have to drive back. No problem. Okay. We'll all have some. One for each of us. Can I trust this? Of course. You'll come back for more. Let's see. - Cheers. - Cheers. - That was good. - Very good. Very good. Good. I'm glad. - Now I really do want to smoke. - Yeah. - But, wait... - You can't smoke here. - Really? - No, the owner doesn't like it. But you can go to the yard. - Want to go? - Yeah. One more for the road? - Okay. - Sure. Just a little. - Thanks, man. - You're welcome. - Thanks. - See you. Bye. You don't seem divorced. Yeah, I am. - Long marriage? - Six years. I married my first boyfriend as soon as I got out of high school. I was pretty old-fashioned. You don't seem old-fashioned, either. So what happened? Nothing. We had some good years. But I suddenly stopped feeling passion, so... I also thought he had stopped loving me the way I wanted to be loved. And I wanted to cheat. That's when I realized it was over. And? I told him, he understood. He understood everything except my wanting to see other people. We stayed together a while longer but I had already made up my mind, you know? So he's actually about to get married again. I think he can't stand being alone. And does that bother you? I mean, can you be alone? Too many questions? It did bother me quite a lot. Only at the beginning. I mean, I'm Leo. I like getting people's attention. But it's because I'm awesome. I don't like when people don't know how to understand me. And yeah, I can be alone. At first it was hard to imagine, but then, after my personal failure, I did a course, I started working and I got over it. Hey, since you work at a bank... thanks. I need to get a credit card so I can buy a new computer. - Okay. - How much does it cost? Look, we don't sell cards. We sell packages. What's a package? It's a number of products that include a credit card. You work independently? Yes. But I prefer to talk about that some other time, if you don't mind. So, have you been single for long? Three months. Do you miss her? Sol's pretty. No. Well, a bit. But it's just normal. It's hard to start seeing other people. It's impossible not to make comparisons. I get it. I had the same problem. But then I realized it was my time to have fun with no restraints. That was it. And if I ever want to have a family, I'll do it. Talking about family at a party on a Saturday night. - I'm boring you. - No. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. I'll take your advice. You need some time to forget. Good thing you didn't have children. - Yeah? - You don't have kids, right? No, no. I always think of that. We almost did though. I wanted to be a mother before the age of thirty, but that wasn't possible. It was better that way, it would have been a mess. So... - To single hood. - To single hood. - To single hood. - Hi. - How are you doing? - What's up? You got tired? I thought I'd bring you more of this drink. Kidding, I missed you guys. Plus, it's depressing in there. They're hugging and taking pictures. Aren't you afraid of getting fired? No. I already got paid. Plus, I wanted to smoke. - Want some? - Thanks. - Where are you guys from? - I'm from Capitán Sarmiento. A small town, 3 hours from here. But I've lived in the capital for a couple of years. Núñez. I used to live in Belgrano when I was married. - Really? - We were neighbors. Yeah. I was born here, though. Now I live in San Telmo with my parents. - You? - I'm from La Plata. Well, actually, my mother is. My father's from Russia, he lives in Moscow. I come and go. Where? Basically I follow the summer. I just got back from Barcelona. - Nice. - Yeah. I never left Buenos Aires. I've traveled, but not enough. Stop staring at us like that, please. - You love to show off. - You love to be stared at. Let me guess. You're... An Aries? No. - What do you think? - I already know. Don't tell him. - You get two more guesses. - I just need one. Okay. You're very energetic. Very passionate. You're beautiful. And you love to hear it. Leo, for sure. - Very good. - Very good. Your turn. Quiet, meticulous. These are the worst. You're a bit jealous of me being here. You're obsessive, but deep down, you want to know how far you can go. You're a lot of talk. But you're doing fine. Scorpio. Yes. What about you? What do you say, Ana? I don't know about star signs. Let me see. You're egocentric. But not narcissistic. You're clearly concerned about the well-being of others and you never stop seducing. You give your undivided attention to your prey, get bored, go for another one, then another one. No, not always. Because you probably pursue an impossible ideal. - It's not impossible. - Libra. Is that good or bad? That's very good. You guessed right. Great. Give him a kiss too. The scorpion. He'll get jealous. Come on. - I loved it. - Satisfied? - Not really. - Why not? Because you have to close the circle. To preserve the harmony. How about if we take this to my place? The party's ending. I don't know. Come on. I just got here, I'm alone, it was my birthday. Just a couple of beers. What do you say? Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday, dear Sol, happy birthday to you. Good morning. How did you sleep? You're the barman from Sol's party. How did we get here? You don't remember? Last night was great. But what happened? Is this your house? Did we...? No, relax. We did some interesting stuff, but we didn't fuck. Look, dude. It's all good, but... - Hi. - Hi. You look really pretty. Thanks. - Good morning. - Good morning. Can you pass me my blazer? Please. Thanks. - You're a gentleman. - Always. That drink you made was strong. Tasty, but strong. It knocked me out. I don't remember anything. In one hand, I'm sorry. But in the other, that's a good thing. Because if something happens, you want to be lucid, right? What time is it? Almost one o'clock. I have things to do. I have to get to a barbecue. I'm leaving too. Sorry it didn't go well. I mean, for your welcome. That's okay, no problem. Last night, you guys gave me your numbers. So we're in a whatsapp group and I've sent you a text. That's what I was going to suggest, we could see each other after things settle down a bit. Yeah, sure. Okay. So your friend lives here all year? Yeah, kind of. He's an astrologist now. He went to Bariloche to make a birth chart for a friend's son. He'll be staying there for a while. And you're staying here? For a few months, yes. Until April, May. Where are you going after that? Barcelona again? I don't think so. I was thinking Costa Rica. Around there, I'm not sure. I have an older brother. He's married, with kids. He lives near me and we usually get together on Sundays. You? I have two brothers and one sister. All of them younger. They still live back there. Do you have siblings? I had a brother who was four years younger than me but he died of cancer at 16. - Cancer at 16? - Yeah. Sucks. Your parents? Are they still together? - Yeah. - Yes. Yours? Same. After what happened with my brother, things went south and they separated. Then they got back together again. I went backpacking through Europe and Asia. I worked as a waiter, then as a cook. Then I started working the bar, and here I am. My parents are still in Moscow and I go from place to place. - How was the meat? - Very good. - Great. - I loved it. - I propose a toast. - Okay. To a memorable weekend. - Cheers. - Cheers. Pardon my asking, but you don't happen to be dying or anything and hoping to enjoy your last days, right? - Nacho. - What? - Do you think... - I'll be around a while. Don't worry about me. It's okay, it's fine. Okay, so can we be honest? Why do we trust each other? We haven't even known each other for a week. It'll be a week at 11 o'clock. And we know each other a bit. True. I get what you mean. But the night we met, I was so impressed with both of you. Okay, wait. I want to know something. Since we're on the subject, you know? What do you prefer, men or women? - And then you tell me to behave. - I just want to know. I'm bi. I've always dated women. But I met a Polish guy a long time ago. We really got along. We didn't understand each other but we had a lot of good sex. I kept dating women after that until one summer in Ibiza five years ago, where I met a couple. We spent all summer together. I was like their lover. Ever since then, something just clicked. I couldn't go back to having a "normal" relationship and being okay with it. Something was missing. I want everything in life. Everything. And I know that a trio is what I want. But I don't just mean for sex. I mean everything. A family, a relationship. I don't know if it would happen with you guys. I want to get to know you. But ever since I saw you, I felt something. I was surprised. It was love at first sight. - Is this for real? - Yes. I sort of get what you're saying, but tell us a bit more. After the experience I had that summer, I changed. Nothing could ever be the same. It left a mark. There was a before and after. I can't explain it. Okay, can you be a little clearer about your proposition, or your expectations regarding us two? Nacho wants to know if you want to screw him. To wrap this up, I think that an ideal relationship is between three people. And that's all it is. I know it because I lived it. Maybe you'll know too. I'd love that. Now we have to get to know each other, see what happens. We got this far. I had thought of something simpler. Like you and me, Ana between us, all of us friends, and that's it. You want us to be together or something like that? Who has three-way relationships? Who has ever saw that? I've seen it happen. Libra men seek their ideal world. Nacho's right. I mean, I'm still intrigued. But a relationship between two people is hard and between three people, it's even harder. Yes, don't you know how the saying goes? "Three's a crowd." That saying is old. And I'm not asking you to be in a relationship with me now. Or tomorrow. I'm just telling you what I feel, what I want. Whether or not it works out is another thing. But we're here now. So let's get to know each other and make the most of the weekend. Let's see what happens. In every way. Then we'll decide. Maybe it'll just be a nice weekend. But what if it isn't? What if it's memorable? - I'll toast to that. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. So? Is it what you imagined? Are you happy? I am. I'm very content. I don't know about happy. We're still not in a relationship and tomorrow's Monday. And the carriage turns into a pumpkin. Or a bank. What do you think? How did you like these past days? This week, yesterday, today. Was it what you imagined or expected? I can't stop thinking about what you said. And it's nicer than I thought. But it's true. Tomorrow's Monday and we have to get back to our lives. We can't live in a fantasy world. Why not? There's three of us. Two is already difficult. Three won't work. The world is made for couples, not for trios. And? And if you go to a bank. For example, and ask for a mortgage loan, they'll ask you who your spouse is, you know? You can only have one spouse, not two. Let's say you want to get on a medical plan as a trio. They won't accept that. Plus, what do we tell our families? "I have two partners"? I like you. - Alright, fine. - He's right. Let's say we wanted to get married. Three? Even a gay couple has more rights than a trio. I don't know how to deal with it, and I don't want to be called a slut for being with two guys. It's true. So... It's all about what other people might think? Because I live in the present. I don't know what they'll think, I don't really care. You could see how it goes. I live in reality too, and at nine o'clock tomorrow morning, I have to go to a bank. And when the guys ask me what I did on the weekend, if I tell them I was in a trio, they won't ask when I'm getting married, they'll just call me wild. You know what I mean? - He's right. - Yeah. Alright, Ana. What about you? - What? - Who would you choose? Who do you like more? I don't know. I like you both a lot. And you both really turn me on. I think I'd choose Nacho as a boyfriend. But you'd bore me two years in. And I'd choose you as a lover. I think that if I had something serious with you, I'd be really scared. I'd be insecure about being dumped for another girl or guy. Well, there you go. So it's perfect. With the two of us, you have the boyfriend and the lover. And I'd never leave you. Or you. What happens in trios is that someone is left out. Really? But this is not a conventional trio. I wouldn't leave anyone out. And now you tell me, who do you like more? Who would you choose? As a partner, Ana. You're more like a friend. I mean, it's fine, I liked what we did. I mean, I liked what we did but I have no clear indications of what you want. And if you told me you wanted us two to date, I'd think about it. A lot. But I'd think about it. But a trio? No. The world isn't made for three people, that's all. I know I've said that many times. I'm sorry if I ruined your utopian idea of love, but it's true. That's okay. We said we'd make it a weekend and we did. Everything's fine. You said you had had that relationship. How many times did you try a trio? - Nacho. - No, it's okay, it's okay. Only once, in London. With a couple. But they were already established. That's not the same thing. It was hard to adjust. I want to start from scratch now. The way we did. That's all. And it's different. I'm sure it is. It's possible. We can do it. We can still be friends. Right? Yeah, obviously. I'm okay with that. Or not? I shouldn't say this. But I don't want to look for anyone else. You two are the ones. I want you for myself. As partners. Not friends. Did you hear from Sebas? I added him on Facebook but he didn't accept me. Me neither. But he must be really busy. Poor guy. First his brother died, now his father. Yeah, poor guy. I still don't know what it's like to lose a family member. Would you like to see him? I'd like to know he's okay. That's all. How's work? How's that going? As always. - Hi. - How are you? - Good. - Yeah? - Yeah. You? - Good. Look, I... It doesn't work. I figured that. Do you think the same? What do you mean? If I think the same? I mean, if Sebas wouldn't have appeared in our lives with all the things that happened later, maybe you and me would be together by now. But... ...he was right. It's hard to compare him to me. Don't be silly, I still like you. But we went further than this. And it's not the same anymore. You know? And if he hadn't left? What would have happened? You think the three of us could be together? I've been thinking about it for weeks. Maybe we just had to see each other a few more times. But... Look, I want to be with someone. I want to have a good relationship, a real one. For as long as it lasts. But I don't think it could be with you or with him. Don't you get mad? You mean us together, or separate? We had a really nice adventure, don't you think? It's better to leave it there. Did I forget my make-up purse at your house? Yes. In the bathroom. Perfect. You left fast. Joaquín asked me if it was mine. Can we go get it now? Then I'll take the subway. Okay. I have to finish two web pages for Friday. So I can pay the new computer, with all that interests... Awful. Ready? How's your mother doing? A little better now. But she's been through a lot. She'll be fine. She's staying in Moscow for a few days. After the funeral paperwork, she went to stay with my grandparents. She gets along with my dad's family. And my grandparents were feeling pretty bad, so it was a good idea. What about you? Why are you back? I wanted to pause a bit, get some distance. How long are you staying? Are you staying? I don't know. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd find you together. I suppose so, because it happens. That's fine. No. We're not together. No. We tried. But it didn't work. I thought about you two a lot. Here we are again. Again. Two nights, and a Monday. The carriage, the pumpkin. But it's different, isn't it? What do you think? What do you want? - What would it be like? - For the three of us to date? It would be the way I imagined, because I still think and feel the same way. Nothing has changed for me. It's just better now, isn't it? Be honest. But we'd be like lovers. I don't know. We could see each other here on weekends. Yeah, we can tell people we met someone here and use it as an excuse to come over. You don't really need to explain much. - I'm not ashamed of you two. - Me neither. Neither am I. But I can't go out and say, "Hi, this is my girlfriend. Oh, and my boyfriend. It's the three of us." It's not normal. You just can't. The world is made for two, not three. - How many times have I said it? - Many. But you're right. Whatever you say. The important thing is that we're fine this way now. We can keep seeing each other. Why do we have to tell the whole world who we're with and what we're doing? It's private. Right? Yes. But we can also tell everyone to piss off and then move in together. Which is what will happen. Hold on a minute. Do you want us to drop everything and go live in the countryside? Today's commute is already a mess, we're an hour away from Buenos Aires. Forty minutes. And you're a romantic. I love it. Let's see each other here on weekends. It'll be our secret. Ana, you can work on your computer anywhere. Right? - Yes. - Good. Just go to Buenos Aires when you need to. Nacho, you're 40 minutes away by bus. I'll get a job around here and it'll be perfect. Everything would be fine. We'll do our own thing during the day and get together in the evening like any normal family. Like a rather weird family. Look... I still feel the same way. I feel what I used to feel. I want to be with you two. It's clearer to me now. I know you're the ones. That's what's going to happen. We'll end up living together. So why postpone it? Why waste more time? Let's watch a movie. We'll talk about this later. Yeah. Let's enjoy that we're here together again. Plus, it's different now, because we're going to keep seeing each other. Think about it. Because if this works, we'd give hope to all the weird relationships out there. Good morning. It's seven o'clock. I have to be at the bank at nine. - Are you getting up? - Yeah. Wake us up in half an hour. Okay, okay. I already made coffee. Coffee for the three of us. The way each one likes. Why don't you stay home today? - I can't do that. - Come on. You know I can't. Well, you can stay here but I'm leaving, okay? Are you joining me for breakfast? - Yeah. - I want some coffee. I already made some. It's seven o'clock. Damn it. Come on. What more do you want? Breakfast in bed? I hate Mondays. So how was it? Very good. So good. Yes. Alright, let's go. So, next Saturday? Yeah. Right? That was the plan. That's what I wanted to talk about. I've been thinking about that a lot. How much this guys thinks. I was just thinking that we have to get organized. I mean, if we're going to live together, we have to learn to get organized, right? Right? Yeah. Come on. Get up. - Come on. - No, no, no. I mean it, it's late. Come on, who cares. - How's it going? - Good, you? Fine. - Can you pass me the yerba? - Yeah. - Listen, this is for you. - What is it? Money. It's for rent until the end of the year. So I can keep the room. Give me a break, this isn't you. What's the matter with you? What is this? I know it seems crazy, but I want to do it. I want this experience, I want to see what happens. And if it doesn't work, I'll come back. Nacho, dude, look. If you want to experiment, great. I'm cool with it. If you want to be bi, I support you, no big deal. But you're moving in with someone you just met and a guy that comes and goes all the time. And you're going to be together in a far away town. Have you thought about that? It's weird. It's not even an hour-long commute, and plus, a lot of people live outside the capital. Sure, with a wife and kids. If you two were friends, that would sound good to me. But you're all going to be in a trio. In a relationship. Why don't you just go there to have sex? That's all. Plus, what are you going to tell people? What will you tell the guys? Nothing. And neither will you. The official story is that I'm with Ana, and she's saying the same. Sebastián will see what he says. In any case, it's our life. So get off my case. Your life? How long have you known each other? Three fucks? And what are you telling Sol? Does she know? I'm taking a couple of bags with the bare necessities for a few days, and next week, I'll come by and get the rest of the things. So I'll see you later. And Sol wanted me to meet new people, and I did. You should meet someone too. You're getting a little annoying. What did they do to you? They brainwashed you. - When are you leaving? - Now. - Now? - Yeah. Ana is on her way with her things in a taxi. And Sebastián is waiting for us at the house. Okay, that's fine. I think it's fine. Yeah, you think so? Yeah, dude. I agree on keeping the room. I think it's fine. Don't look at me like that. I already calculated it. Twenty-five minutes from the train station to Saavedra bridge, and then 35 minutes to get to here. That's an hour, and I'm not even counting the bus. One hour more or less. No, one thing is 50 minutes and another is 120. The important thing is that we're here. And this is our first night in our little nest. How about if we shower and have something to eat? Wait, let's get our stuff out sorted first, my clothes need to be in a closet. - Yeah. - Okay. Let's put a few things away. And we should buy another closet, right? Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. Let's use the space we have and then see about that. If it's not enough, we'll buy one. Okay. We can also just buy a house for the three of us. - You think so? - Yeah, why not? If we get along, it would be cool to pick one together. There's time for that. Let's give it a few months. Yeah, there's no rush. It's still too soon to talk about that, you know? - Yeah. - How are things at home? What did you say? The only one who knows everything is Joaquín, my friend. But he promised he wouldn't say anything. If more people find out, they'll start talking. It'll get back to me, and I don't want that. I told my family I was with Nacho and that we were moving into his family's cabin which we're renting out to you. If things get serious, you joined us and we live together. - But... - What? You're not sure about this yet? Well, no. I don't know. Wait a minute, this is what you wanted. We're here, we moved in. Now let's let it flow. What if none of us likes living together? What if we don't want to see each other anymore? Or we just want to see each other twice a week? It can happen. Otherwise, I don't know. How do we return to regular society after a relationship between three? Okay, let's lay down some ground rules, then. - Okay. - Fine. First of all, don't make us feel like this is your house. I won't. And let's have our space. Let's not smother each other. - Okay? - Yeah. Yeah. If we want this to last longer than three nights, I agree with Ana. And if either of you stop caring about me, I want you to tell me. Be honest. Okay. And it's important that I sleep from Sunday to Thursday. Because I'll have to work. What about you? You try to be more imperfect. Or we won't be able to love you. If I fall, I want you two to let me. As long as I know you're there, it won't bother me. But I don't want to be the only one with the ideas. I feel like I'm the only one that starts things, seeks things. For example, I brought some wine. How about you guys? I brought some weed. - I brought music. - Perfect. I can't sleep. Damn, I can't sleep. - What's the matter? - I'm not sleepy. Nacho's sleeping. - No, he's not. - What time is it? Nacho, you asleep? Nacho, are you asleep? What time is it? I have to go to work. No, it's 4 a.m. Want to watch a movie? Four o'clock, dude? I can sleep three more hours. What's the matter with you? Damn it. Now I can't sleep. Me neither. Okay, now that none of us can sleep, want to watch a movie? The two of you are disgusting! What possessed me to date two men at once? What the hell is this? And lift the toilet seat when you pee. - I'm not your servant. - Hey, it wasn't me. It was him. What did I do? - Hey. - Hi. Sorry about the time. We got distracted after office with Nacho's friends. Yeah, sorry. We said we'd eat at nine. I cooked all night like an idiot, today marks our first month. We'll heat it up. We'll heat it up. No, dude, you don't heat up pasta. Don't get like that. Hey, don't throw away the food. There you have the food. Are you hungry? Go have dinner with his friends. And then wash the dishes. Whoa, hey. Enough? Am I forgiven? - Look how we clean. - Great. We clean. It's ready now. - Thanks. - Thank you. Thanks. You shouldn't have bothered. - Well? - Let me see. So? Was it so hard as you imagined? No, well, I don't know. I never heard Luciana so many times, saying she's disturbed. Yeah, it bothers me that people need to know who with whom, how we do things, all that. I guess the reply depends on who's asking. How about your parents? How did they take it? - Mine took it pretty well. - What do you mean by that? Much better than Nacho's mom. Kind of like his father and brother. They'll get used to it. They need time. Let me see. It's 12 o'clock. - Should we go? - Yeah. Okay. Just a bit of milk, one lump of sugar and well stirred. Just how you like it. - Thanks. - You're welcome. So... Tell me. What's up? - I got a promotion. - Really? - Yes. - That's great! Congratulations! - Thanks. - That's great news. Yeah. So is that why you called me? You said it was urgent and had to see me in person. Are you really in such a hurry? We haven't seen each other in ages, Nacho. Yeah, I know. It's not that. It's just that I have to take two trains and a bus. Right. Turns out the fund has gotten involved in the construction business. There are some great apartments and I already bought one. I wanted to tell you about them in case you were interested. They're not on sale yet. Okay. It's great. I'm glad things are going well. But as you know, I'm living outside the city. Yeah, it's weird. The bigger the crisis, the better it is for us. I know that's where you live. But it's a very interesting opportunity, and it's good to think about the future, Nacho. It's a condo in Puerto Madero, the apartments are fully equipped and we'd be neighbors. It would be great, don't you think? And with your salary, you could pay it easily. I quit my job at the bank. Nacho. What are you going to do now? Are you going to sell bracelets at a fair? Plant lettuce? No, Sol. I'll be an accountant for the neighborhood businesses and I signed up at a foundation that does social work. Ana found a bar near our house that I use an office. Sebastián has a lot of work. We're just fine. We have more free time now. - How much longer? - What? How much longer? Do you think this will last? I hope so. I don't get it. Did you really become...? Bisexual. Okay, Sol. Have a good year. What's the matter? Why are you laughing to yourself? Did you get a reward or compensation at the bank? Speaking of which, I have some money to give you for this month's expenses. That's what I wanted to talk about. I've been saving some of the money we've been earning. I love you. And? And we have more than enough to go to the coast for two weeks. - Well? - Yeah. We can go to Gesell or any beach in the south. And if we keep a budget, maybe we can go to Cabo Polonio. Oh, yes, please. Yes, yes. Anywhere with a beach. I love the sea. - What do you think? - It's fine. - What do you prefer? - You guys can choose. But give us some input. What's the matter? I want to visit my mother. Is she okay? You just miss her and want to see her? Everything's fine. I miss her and she misses me, she wants to see me. So, that's it. I'm going to go. Plus, I want to pause a bit and get away a bit. Well, then use our savings for the ticket and expenses. We can go to the coast on a weekend with my bonus. - It'll be fine. - Yeah, obviously. We can go somewhere together for the winter holidays. Thanks. I do have money saved up, don't worry. It was my father's. I'll be using that. So when are you leaving? I guess you have to arrange with your mother, but will it be for a few weeks, or more? I was thinking three weeks. There are cheap tickets so I want to buy now. I'll prepare some things here before I leave. What do you need to prepare? You're coming right back. - You are coming back, right? - Yeah, yeah. Of course. This week I worked three nights in a row. I'm very tired. Want to go to sleep? - Okay. - Let's go to sleep. - Are you awake? - What is it? What? I was thinking. What did Seba mean by needing a pause and some distance? - What? - What did he mean? I don't know. Today at dinner. He said he needed some distance and a pause. What was that about? He misses his mom. Don't get paranoid. He was acting weird. It was weird. Do you think his mom's sick? We'll ask him tomorrow. No, something is wrong. Get some sleep. - Good morning. - Good morning. Hey, good morning. - How did you sleep? - Not that well. My neck hurts. I think we need a bigger bed. - Right? - Could be. We can buy it this afternoon. What do you want for breakfast? Want to go to town for breakfast and come with me to the drugstore? Or we can just buy something around here. It's the same to me. Seba, do you remember when you said that you had to resolve some things before you left? What would that be? I don't know what you mean. There's something the matter. You said you needed a pause. From whom? From us? No, I don't know. I just want to see my mom. - But is your mom okay? - My mom's okay. She doesn't have cancer and I'm not dying either. So, then... what do you have to resolve before you leave? I mean, things are okay here. We can help with what you need. I'll be working in town. What's the problem? Hey, what's the matter? Come on. I've never seen you this way. Are you going to leave us? Are you leaving us? No, not at all. That's not it. It's... My friend, Lucas, called. He says he's going to live in Bariloche and this house is already on sale. Is this house very expensive? I don't know. He said we could buy it if we wanted to. And money would not be a problem. Nacho, do you know if we can get a loan? - Sure. - Okay. Great. Tell your friend we'll buy it. - What? - Tell him we'll buy it. - Really? - Yeah. We'll buy it. Was that the problem? Yeah. Everything was so great that I didn't know how long it could last. The dramatic moment never happens. I've thought about that a lot too. Me too. Well. It does not happen. Okay. So what's for breakfast? Pastries or biscuits? - Both. - Both. Okay, let's go. Just one thing. I think I'm going to have to stop smoking. Wait a minute. Hold on a second. Just hold on. Are you sure you're pregnant? Yes. I'm due on August 16. - It's a little girl. - Or a little boy. And who's the father? Both of us. Right. Don't you think you've gone a bit too far with this?
