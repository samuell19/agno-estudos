WHY IS EVERYONE SO BLEEDIN' INTERESTED ALL OF A SUDDEN IN ME GOING BACK TO HER? DID SHE ASK YOU TO COME HERE? NO. NO. LOOK AT IT THIS WAY- SHE'S GOT TO ASK ME. I'VE GOT ME PRIDE, YOU KNOW. LOOK, YOU'RE IN THIS DUMP. SHE'S IN HOSPITAL. BUT SHE'S GOT A FLAT TO GO TO WHEN SHE COMES OUT. SHE'S ON HER OWN. YOU'RE NOT GETTING ANY YOUNGER, EITHER OF YOU. WE WERE ONLY SUGGESTING THIS FOR THE BENEFIT OF BOTH OF YOU. I DON'T KNOW... I DON'T KNOW. WHAT HAPPENED TO HER? PNEUMONIA. SUPPOSE I DID GO BACK TO HER. THERE ARE THINGS TO BE WORKED OUT, YOU KNOW. SUCH AS? WELL, LIKE, UH, HOW DO I GET THERE? WE'LL GIVE YOU A TRAVEL WARRANT. WELL, IT ISN'T THAT I MIND GOING BACK. IT'S JUST THE APPEARANCE OF IT. HOW DO YOU MEAN? WELL, MY APPEARANCE. I'M NOT EXACTLY WEAVER-TO-WEARER, AM I? I COULDN'T GO BACK LIKE THIS. I MEANTHAT WOULD PUT HER RIGHT BACK IN HOSPITAL. WE'LL FIX YOU UP WITH A SUIT AND A PAIR OF BOOTS. THAT'LL FETCH YOU UP A BIT, WON'T IT, IN POUNDS? LET ME PUT YOU STRAIGHT,. ROSS. YOU WON'T BE GIVEN ANY MONEY. I'LL SEE THE W.V.S. AND THE SALVATION ARMY. THEY'LL FIX YOU UP BETWEEN THEM. YOU MEAN CHARITY, SIR? SOMEBODY'S CASTOFFS? LISTEN, ROSS, I'VE SEEN YOU CADGING COPPERS IN THE STREET. YOU'RE A BUM, A DRUNK. THE LAST TIME YOU TOOK A JOB WAS 5 YEARS AGO, AND YOU LEFT THAT AFTER YOUR FIRST WAGE. SO DON'T GIVE ME ANY GUFF ABOUT BEING TOO PROUD TO TAKE CLOTHES FROM THE W.V.S. I'LL SEE YOU GET KITTED UP, BUT YOU'LL GET NO MONEY. YOU UNDERSTAND? HOW ABOUT SOME MONEY FOR A RAZOBLADE AND A HAIRCUT? I'LL NEED A MEAL ON THE TRAIN. GIVE ME A QUID FOR THE LOT. 5 BOB. THAT'S FOR THE SHAVE AND THE HAIRCUT. YOU GET ANOTHER 5 BOB WHEN YOU GET ON THE TRAIN, AND THAT'S YOUR LOT. OK. I'LL MANAGE SOMEHOW. RIGHT. BIT OF A CHANGE, ANYWAY. WHAT'S SHE LOOK LIKE NOWADAYS? I DON'T KNOW. THEY DIDN'T SEND ME A PHOTOGRAPH. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO JUDG A BEAUTY CONTEST, YOU KNOW. YOU'RE JUST GOING HOME. I BELIEVE YOU HAVEN'T SEEN YOUR WIFE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. THAT'S RIGHT, MA'AM. SHE'S BEEN VERY ILL, YOU KNOW. SO THEY TOLD ME. PNEUMONIA, WASN'T IT, MA'AM? YES. SHE WAS IN A VERY POOR WAY. SERIOUS THING, I BELIEVE, WHEN THEY CATCH IT IN THE HEAD. WELL, SHE'S RESPONDED WELL TO TREATMENT, BUT, UH, A GREAT DEAL IS GOING TO DEPEND ON YOU. NOW, CAN YOU BE RELIED ON? WELL, I KNOW MY RECORD'S A BIT SPOTTY. THERE'S NO SENSE IN NOT BEING OPEN ABOUT IT. BUT I'LL DO WHAT I CAN TO MAKE UP. WELL, DO MY BEST. I CAN'T SAY MORE THAN THAT. HOW ARE YOU OFF FOR FUNDS? MA'AM? DID YOU GET ANY NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ON ARRIVAL? OH, YES, THEY TREATED ME VERY WELL. GAVE ME 10 BOB. I HAD A SHAVE AND A SPRUCE AND GOT MYSELF A NEW HAT. AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, I WANT HER TO SEE ME AT MY BEST. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, OF COURSE. WELL, I'M AFRAID WE DON'T HAVE MUCH IN THE WAY OF FUNDS FOR THIS SORT OF DISBURSEMENT, BUT I'LL GIVE YOU A POUND. THIS SHOULD TIDE YOU BOTH OVER UNTIL YOU GET YOUR WIFE HOME, AND THEN YOU CAN SEE THEM AGAIN. THANK YOU, MA'AM. VERY GOOD OF YOU. Almoner: COME IN, MRS. ROSS. MAGGIE? HELLO, ARCHIE.
