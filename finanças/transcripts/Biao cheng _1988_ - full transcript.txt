Film name: Runaway Blues Director: David Lai Starring: Andy Lau, Sau-Ling Lui Screenwriter: Kit Lai Producer: Yan-Wai Lam, Wai-Jun Suen Thank you, fellows. - Where's Kwong? - Yeah, where's Kwong? - Kwong is here. - Brother Kwong! - Kwong. - Big Brother. How did I do? Great! You're the hot-shot this year. Big Brother. We're gonna win again next year, -aren't we? - That's for sure. Yes, that's true. Kwong, I go to talk to you. Let's go over there. Last year you made lot of money in the deal of tea from Swatou. I've placed a heavy bet on you in the motorcycle race tomorrow. I'll leave it to you. Big Brother, you got to give it a shot. Good! Fuck your ass. We'll see if it's gonna be me or you. You're doomed. We'll win for sure. We'll see. Let's go. Ready. Do you want to die with me? I don't. We got to live together! Jump! Kwong. Kwong. Kwong! Lame Bastard, get up! Look! Someone died. Run. Kwong, run! Don't run! Call the police! Hurry up! Kwong! Kwong, come on! Beat it! Someone's coming after you! Run! Move! Kwong! Kwong! Run! Run! Run! It's out of date. Why still play that kind of game? Run a gang? Run away from the cops or enemies? Anyway it's time gangs' heads rest. Now the regulation is like the company one in Hong Kong. We call each other partner instead of brother. Brother! You got to catch up with the trend. In stick-up jobs we use machine guns. In Hong Kong, Syndicates are everywhere. Triads and whore houses even issue stocks to shareholders. It's about big money! Please don't bother. Never tell others you're on the run. Tell that you're an immigrant. Be smart, or they'll look down on you. Uncle Nip, thank you. I won't stay here long and give you trouble. Have you got him an I.D. card? Got one from Macau, and it's in good status. Thanks a lot. Put on a pair of horn-rimmed glasses. It'd make you graceful and the cops won't give you any trouble. Okay. Please, hold on a minute. It's Counselor Tam. Tell him to make his bet on No.3 and 5 of Round 3,No.16 of Round 5. That's all I've known. In the past, they were obedient to us. But we can't piss off those counselors now. Don't you make a sound! Kwong, you're recommended by Dai and Cheng, so you're our comrade. Don't feel bothered by what's happening tonight. I certainly won't. Uncle Nip, how come his feet are broken? He's only a punk. He don't mean nothing. Who's your boss? Wah... the real boss? Wetback Wah. Who? Is it the asshole from the Anti-triad? The half-caste Ronnie? You're here for no more than two years. How dare you playing the nark for cops? Want to get yourself a medal, huh? Who is it? Haven't got the wages. Sue is asking for cost of living? No.3 and No.5 of Round 3. Just one shot is enough! What's the matter? He... You keep ignoring Sue, she'll certainly get to you here. It's not safe for Kwong to stay in a hotel. Go and rent a room from Sue. 3 thousand dollars per month. Our company will pay for the rent, or the cost of living, whatever you call it. Leave Kwong to Sue. Come, eat some orange. Don't damage it, it's government property. Go on with your sleep. There's nothing happening. Ronnie. Ronnie Cambridge. Chief Inspector. Anti-Triad. Just got back from special branch. I wonder if he understands a thing. Translate it. He told you, he's a half-caste. His name is Ronnie. The chief inspector of Anti-Triad. He just got transferred from Special Branch. The hems hurt again. That proves I'm not gay. Not all British are gay. My mother is Chinese, so half of me is your compatriot. Isn't that right, brother? That's right. How will you account for it? You have been here only two days, but you already killed the Hunan guy, as a souvenir for Lord Nip. It's a big present. Do you know the Hunan guy is my nark? I heard about your big-time in Taiwan. You know, I have a big heart. Wetback. Wipe him out! A nark for a nark. Taiwan comrade in exchange for the dead. From now on, you'll be my nark. And keep an eye on Lord Nip and Chiu Kwai. You're nut... I only have to make a phone call. The dissident will be set back to Taiwan by plane. No need to go through the department procedure. You can go back and sing your Taiwan serenade. Come, a toast to the Hunan guy. What do you say making a go at a woman in Taiwan? A "bang". Same thing. Like execution. Is anybody home? Don't call the police, Do not call the police. Don't. Don't be afraid. What's going on? My mother... Go away! What are you looking at? Don't come near me! - Go away! - What? What's wrong with you? What the hell's going on? Stay still. It may hurt. Go away! Don't be afraid. You'll be alright. Haven't you watched enough? I won't thank you for saving me. You better not tell Lord Nip about it. It's good you didn't call the police. Uncle Nip told me to rent a room from you. You're on the run? Don't mess around with my business. It's just an accident. I'm not that stupid to kill myself. If I wanted to get rid of it, I would have resorted to the doctor. People like us don't want any trouble. You son is smart. He even told me not to be afraid. At his age, saying such things, he was born to be a robber. I'm sure he'll become a sleazy character. Why do you say so? He is only a kid. It's him who gave me trouble. A wetback from Taiwan. No letter? How come there's so little? Where's the rest? For the handling charge. It's the company's policy. Are you trying to play tricks on me? Now, listen to me. Who do you think you are? I'll talk to your boss! I'm in charge of here. Things are getting tough now. It's luck if you can get it by. The Rolexes are eight thousand dollars a piece, we'll deduct two thousand dollars for transaction charge. Sell it or not. So it's gonna be six thousand a piece. Last time it was eight thousand, wasn't it? We're both Chinese. We make money together. Besides we have to feed a whole bunch of staff. We even have to give the cops a share. We're in the same boat. I swam here. I didn't take the boat. Don't make me lose your face. What is it? ls it a deal or not? Two hundred forty thousand only. Cash. I thought you knew English. Asshole mainland boy! You want to end up like the Hunan guy and have fun with Satan in hell, don't you? So, you have a part in Hunan guy's business. You son of a bitch! Take the bag along with you! Freeze! Tell Dai and Cheng to send us the money soon. Shit. I knew long distance call is expensive. How is Dai doing? Who the hell is in charge anyway? I'm asking who is in charge? Where's Loong? Out again? To Taipei? Alright. Tell him to call me as soon as he comes back. Okay. That's all. You don't need to do it yourself. You should let the boys do the work. It's impossible for them to deal with it. If I hadn't responded quickly enough, Hunan guy's case will be all over the world. Who blew it? Don't blame Kwong, he's new in town. He didn't know the situation. I apologize. I should have let them know earlier. Kwong is quite efficient. If it's not him, I wouldn't be able to shake the guy. You always want to show your savvy to your boys. The stall reserved some durians for me, you can have some if you like it. Ching, go bring them here. Tell Kwong to give one to Sue if you don't have time. Kwong. Take good care of Sue, and the kid. How are they doing? Very fine. Let me know if you're low on cash. Thank you. Boss, a pack of Royal Hemorrhoid Cream. I heard Chiu Kwai and Wah are at loggerheads. What happened? I don't care. It's none of my business. It's about time you change your I.D. card. I won't put you on. Listen, get some bandage. I'm gonna teach you. First make a cross knot... a diagonal cross knot. That means. from the left thigh. and underneath the... the... the bushes. Wrap it around the right buttock and pull it up. Understand? And then. raise the right leg... and underneath the bushes. Wrap it around the left buttock and pull it up to the waist and tie it up. Got it? It's embarrassing. You don't have to look. It's the way you describe it. My thing isn't embarrassing. Why did you learn to dress a woman's wound? The bushes are almost at the same position as the privates. Lord Nip. I've valuated it. I can emigrate to Canada anytime I want. But once I leave my business alone, it will be over. So I decide again not to go. Don't worry your head over it. You're still young. This money is for you. Be good. Change your clothes. We're girls, don't be shy. No. I'll do it for you. Come on. Come. Has Chiu still come to see you? I don't want to see him anymore. He better not see me either. You guys are not married, but everyone knows you're his wife. Don't go on acting like this. Last month, he forced me to have sex with me and infected me with the clan. The son of a bitch. He changed nothing. Last week I had a miscarriage. Lord Nip. Please help me out. Hi. Chiu Kwai's punks can't be that smart. Why did you stick your nose in? I don't know what you mean by that. Where did you hide the Rolexes? What Rolexes? Should I know? I haven't seen any. You must know about the death of Hunan guy. Idiot. You're really a shit head. When the nark worked, I didn't come to Hong Kong yet. It was none of my business. Since you knew he's a nark, you must be involved. What is it? Are you sure you need to play such a game in modern times? Alright. Let's have some fun since you want it. Come on. Not bad. Was it good? Go desperate? Stop! Cut it out! What are you laughing at? Face the wall. Face the wall. We're only fooling around. You too. Be quick! Spread your legs! You too! Come on. Move it! What are you doing? Come on, we're all Chinese. That's right. We're blood brothers, Mr. Policeman. Cut your crap! Should we fix him? Fix him. Give me your I. D. card. What are you trying to do? Let me do it. - Headquarters. This is Immigrant 1st Platoon. - What? This is Immigrant First Platoon. Who's calling Headquarters? Over. I lost 37118 hill to enemy. We need reinforcement. Please send men to support me. What's that? Over. Is it fun? It's my turn. Let me sing you a song. Who the hell is you? Fight for win... Mom, the lift is coming. Hurry up. Coming. Coming. Wait a minute. Thanks a lot. Want me to take a photo of you? Ready. Alright. Let's have one together. It's yours. Thank you. It comes out very good. Lord Nip. We have trouble. Wah sent us a warrant for Kwong's arrest by fax. It seems they need both fell guy and money. Kwong has made a mess again. We can't blame it all on Kwong. How come you're marked by the Immigrant? - Who is it? - It's Tin-Tong. School has just finished? Thank you. Good boy. Uncle Hung. Aunt Ching. Aunt Ching. Good boy. - Class is over? - Lord Nip. Come and have a hug. Aunt, here's some candy for you. Good. Lord Nip, he took this picture for me this morning. Looks like Wah is beginning his move. You shouldn't have let the jerk get involved. What are you talking about? I think it's better for Sue and Kwong, for the time being, to go to Guangzhou. Since Wah came from there, he'll never go back there. You can drop by Grandma on the way. Why? Why must we hide out from the immigrant? Now the immigrant is hidden while we're exposed. Kwong and Sue shouldn't be involved. It's better for our action if they hole up. Aunt Ching will look after the kid. Get them entrance permit as soon as possible. Why should Sue go too? Sue has already been scouted, besides she's in poor health. She needs a rest. And she can also take care of Kwong. He's from Taiwan, he doesn't know the way around in Mainland. How lucky you are. You sure travel a lot. Where will you go if you have a choice? Fuck. Do you have a choice? Is it healed? What's healed? You should cut it down. You scored again? All men were wearing green caps. It's fun. You know them? They can be regarded as our founders. Many of them are members of triads. The history of triad is longer than CPC. These founders of triads are luckier than us. They sacrificed their lives for the country. They even had monuments, and their names will be remembered in the aftertime. For us, even if we lose our lives, we don't get any merit. Sue, Sue... Grandma... It's getting late. You should go to bed. Be covered with the quilt. Don't catch a cold. Please go to sleep. Grandma. - Don't stay up too late. You go to sleep. - I know. Go to bed early. Here, I'm like an illiterate. Look. Each character is like malnourished, each of them lacks some part. Lam as in Lam Piu. Lam as in Lam Zak-Tsui loan still receive it if you send it like this. Shek Sue-Wah. Your surname is Shek. Shek Tin-Tong. He uses my surname. Let me teach you the simplified Chinese characters. I know them. Good. What shall I write? Addressed to Lam Kwong. Guangzhou. Addressed to Lam Kwong. Where does it go? Lanzhou. Slow down. Hurry up. Addressed to Lam Kwong. Suzhou. - Harbin. To Lam Kwong. - Slow down. - Beijing. To Lam Kwong. - You're naughty. To Lam Kwong. Hong Kong. To Lam Kwong. Macau. It means I have traveled all over China. Hurry up. Run! Excuse me. Stop! Damn it! Even Guangzhou isn't secure. Where should I go? It's too dark. Accompany me to the toilet. Okay. Keep it down. Grandma is sleeping. Come on, hurry up. Don't go too far. I'm afraid of the dark. Don't worry. Don't peek. Why the worry? There isn't anything I haven't seen. My wound isn't healed yet. Lord Nip, this is Sue. Guangzhou isn't secure either. Someone here tried to kill us. He told us to go back. Okay. - What is it? - We'll walk upstairs from the fifth floor. Come, you go first. Be careful. Kwong! Kwong! I missed you so much. After you left, your follower Loong has already taken your place. He even wanted me. I showed him my back and scared him away. You can never go back to Taiwan. Now I'm alone and I'm still yours. Your scars are like railway tracks. Here is to Hong Kong. And hereto Guangzhou. This is to Taiwan. There's no train to Taiwan. There is. Just make another cut here. Do you know how much blood I have let out? It's for you. Are you crazy? 3000 dollars. Since I heard that you're low on cash, I don't deduct the tax from it. Besides, there's one more soul living with you, huh? How do you know? Money makes the mare to go. If I didn't put some men to stick around your house, Wah would have made you into mince meat. Why do you keep bothering me if you know everything? I also heard that Nip and Wah have a row over the booty. What's worse is that the whole lot of watches has disappeared. The two are blaming it on one another. There was a fistfight. Saw you on TV last night. The program is called "Law and Order". Watch it if you have time. It's especially for you guys. Some guy told me you were on the scene. I'm sure you know where the watches are. Who told you that? Cheung Siu-Yin. Take it as a warning. Hong Kong's cops are down to earth... Since you received the money, you got to give us repayment. This is the superiority of capitalism. You got to pay for the Hunan guy's death. The washing machine is handier. It's better to wash the underwear by hands. Before I came, who washed his underwear? I know Kwong never takes care of himself. Of course it's me. We are both the women of these macho guys. What's your plan? It depends on Kwong. What if he has his plan already? He's on the run. He won't plan anything. Don't worry too much. You said we're both the women of these macho guys. Macho guys often say, man in the society can't do everything at will. How about the woman of the man? Isn't she the same? You take it. Come. Five gashes and sixty stitches. Just like a piece of rag. Kwong said, they're like railway tracks, very sexy. You're jealousy. You couldn't lie to me. Have you kissed Kwong? Kwong saw me taking a leak. He even took care of my wound, just here. Have you had a bang with him? Make love. Did he do that? He banged all the time in Taiwan. It's not a big deal. Did he tell you your tits are flat? Big boobs. How many guys have you had a ball with? What? How about you? Me? Don't exaggerate. Tell me the truth. You're getting crazy again. Did you go to bed with her? Tell me. Why? Why didn't you question me when I was in Taiwan? What are you trying to prove now? In Taiwan you said it's only a come-and-go game. What is it? Listen. If you don't have them, don't lose face, put it on. I'm warning you. You want to tempt my man. It's of no use. You're shameless. If you weren't worried that Wah is to get even with me, you don't have to bother following me even when I'm jogging. Lord Nip. Have you got enough pocket money? Kwong paid the rent, didn't he? Yes. But he can't even afford to buy cigarette after that. His people in Taiwan didn't send him money but a chick. Can you make some consideration from the company? Company has its own policy. Besides we haven't made much money lately. Even if I give him a job, Kwong doesn't get along well with the fellows. Also he isn't sociable. I think Kwong has his talent, or he wouldn't be a hot-shot in Taiwan. If the company doesn't make money, we can set up a new one and give him a try. Maybe he can make some profits. Set up a branch? Not a branch... a new company! Be smart. This isn't the place to discuss that stuff. Lord Nip, what's your opinion on Kwong? Alright. Aright. Damn it! Come. It hurts. Mr. Cambridge. Your hems are ripe enough. I'll issue a certificate for you. You can go to hospital this afternoon and get ready for the surgery. What about Kwong's case? I've got it all worked out. Convey my proposal to the brass. We need to organize a special unit and start the stand-by since tonight. Apply for a warrant on Kwong tomorrow. Don't we need Kwong's lead? His lead is a dupe. Kwong, Chiu and Nip are all of the same feather. Now the brass has given me pressure. For the Hunan guy's death, there's a guy who wants to testify against Kwong. But Kwong isn't a big meat? Tonight you should go put some more pressure on him. Let him have no choice but to bite at Chiu Kwai and Wah. As long as there're killings, reporters will make it the news headlines. Then the brass will get awkward. They'll certainly give us 24-hour deadline to arrest the guys. Then I'll dig them out one by one. News will make it well-known. Eventually I'll be further up the ladder to higher position. I'm just afraid Kwong won't buy that. When I place the warrant on him, even if I don't settle him, Chiu Kwai will definitely finish him off. This is called Killing with another person's knife. I suggest you reading more Chinese idioms. Play Boy and self-abuse won't get you anywhere. The operation's code name will be "Hems". Yuck! The blood and flesh will be scraped off. What me to give you a lift? No thanks. I'm gonna get myself a lay. After the surgery I'll have endure self-restraint. Taxi! I'm sure I'll be promoted to a high rank. Don't be too sure. I can't give you the watches now. I'll give you thirty-five percents more, as long as you can give them to us earlier. I'm sorry. I really can't help you. You're wasting my time. I'm gonna take a leak. Chin-san. Chin-san. Wait a second. I got to talk to you. Gold Rolexes. What do you want? I need pocket money. Go into the accounting room first. Rolex. I have some. Tomorrow at nine. I'll discuss it further, will you? It has been 10 years. Be careful not to screw up. It's from boss. You got to trust me. Come on, let's toast to boss. - Cheers! - Cheers! Even though I have all the knacks, I can't beat it from love. I'm here only to get some money. I'll leave soon. Give me a hug first. I'm busy. Seems like I'm bothering you? I never give a fuss about your affair with that old man. Don't accuse me of things I haven't done. I have dozens of men working for me. Don't make me lose face in front of them. Just what have I done? Okay. I can forget what was going on between you and the old man. But now, you carry a torch for Kwong. I'm gonna get to the bottom of it. After 10 years, you dump me and tell the old man to set up a new company for that boy? You don't belong to me anymore, do you? Have you ever cared about me? I became your couple since I was 15. And I even gave birth to Shek Tin-Tong. Shek Tin-Tong? If the kid is ever mine, why on earth does he have your surname? It's because you dumped us. You only give vent to your desire on me. You don't forget it's you who gave me the clan. Come on, all you know is to cry. You just leave Kwong alone. I can do anything. You can, can't you? He can do anything. He even brought his girlfriend from Taiwan. What did you bring with you? A son of another man? Would he accept you two? You have been my woman for 10 years. All you have is just a pair of big boobs. Where the hell is your brain? No. Bug off! Bug off! That's company's money. I'll tell Lord Nip about this. Where's Ronnie? Ronnie? He's in the hospital having an overhauling. What's the matter with him? His hems. You know all about me and Ronnie? Hunan guy worked for the Immigrant and you worked for Old Nip. I filed you up as a nark. I even paid you money from our account each time. '(came my man. I'll certainly give you shelter. A nark said, a bunch of watches will be dispatched from Hong Kong. I think they should be those lost from Wah. It seems Nip and Chiu have something to do with this deal. Check it out for me. This is the first deal between us. Unlike Ronnie, you're being impolite to me. If I kill you now, it just means I killed a scum of the society. There's nothing Ronnie can do about it. Do you know the rules, huh? You're talking to a cop. Since I'm in charge of you, you got to stick to my rules. You got it? You refused it? It's too easy to fix you. I only have to say you killed the Hunan guy, you'll be a sitting duck. I don't need to do anything but you can't survive. Get me out... Get me out... Shit! Go the hell. Have some shit! No...! You bastard! Fuck. You got it now, didn't you? Sue, I'm here. Chiu told me that the cops are looking for you. Why the hell Ronnie is after me? They can always make up any reason. You are the wanted person and wetback from Taiwan, you also affiliated with triads, and immigrants, Since Ronnie can neither nail Chiu and Nip, nor crack the case of immigrants, so they turn their guns on you. At last they won't be blamed by their higher authority. Alright! Stop the bus! Kwong, Kwong! Man, it isn't a stop here. I can't. Stop! I told you to stop! Or I'm gonna jump! What a fool! Don't be like this, Kwong. Kwong, where are you going? Let go of me! Don't care anything about me! I'll go wherever I want. Go and lay low in Macau. Nip got friends there. There won't be any problem there. Why the fear? I won't go to Macau! I'm Kwong and I'm afraid of death! You want death? Go ahead! Go and stand in the middle of the road. Go ahead! Knock me down! Come on! Fuck. I'll be a jerk if I die this way! Is there anything else? Is there anything I've forgot? Our nark said that Kwong is hiding away in Macau. Who is his connection there? What's the stench? Is it from the hems? No, it's the chicken shit. Chicken shit? I never knew chicken shit stinks. It stinks. Thank you. Don't move! There's no one at Sue's place. We got information from Japan that the Rolexes are to be dispatched from Hong Kong. There's some rustling in Ronnie's territory. Chiu Kwai was keeping following us, but now he disappeared all of a sudden. It must be his dirty trick. Is it Chiu Kwai pulling the wires? It's said he has gone to Macau. Shall we tail him there? Let's get things ready on both sides. Yes! I keep wondering where the hell my watches are. You have snatched the watches for Nip, haven't you? That's crap! I never steal your things. After the Hunan guy died, it was reported that he was the nark for the police. It puzzled me. We don't know his identity so we certainly wouldn't kill him. The cops wouldn't kill their own nark, either. You said you don't know anything about who killed the guy. I got a witness. It's okay if you don't say. Let me give you the answer. It's all Old Nip's one-man show. He knew all about the nark for Ronnie, and he wanted to buy him off and do me in. But you asshole want to do something great, and you killed the Hunan guy. You even made me lose my watches. I want you to be responsible for the watches! You knew very well I didn't do it! I knew it. But, since I got paid, I'll have to pay for it. I've learned a few things about capitalism. From now on, he'll be our boss. Don't listen to him. Ask him if he had killed Hunan guy. I've already blocked Nip's routes. Anyone who wants to make money, just follow Chiu Kwai. Now I'll be in charge. Do you have anything to say before you drop dead? When the watches were lost, Chiu Kwai was there with me. When the Hunan guy died, Chiu Kwai was also there with me. Why do you believe not me but Chiu Kwai? He stole your watches and then use the money to buy you off. You're such a dumb ass! It all seems very logical. You think about it. Well, I have the solution. It's best for you to challenge him. And then I'll settle it with you. I'm gonna have some fun now. Give me money and I'll leave him to you. It's fair. Let me tell you, Wah isn't reliable. Let's pretend to fight and rush out of here and then we'll deal with those guys. Okay. Make it look real. Come on. You son of a bitch! You bastard! You fool with my chick! Congratulations, Ronnie. Your hems are gone and Chiu is dead. Double victories! You fellows have done a slick job. Give it to me. Damn it! Failed again! What does it say? The nark had screwed up and Chiu lost his life in Macau. The brass said we've lost face! Fuck. Lord Nip. What is it? Someone has just invaded my place. Where is Tin-Tong? I'm so scared. Tin-Tong and the girl from Taiwan couldn't escape. Please forgive me. Lord Nip, I beg you to help Kwong. I know Wah will force him to swallow the nark's death. Only you can help him. You don't know a thing. It might not be Wah and his gang. It might be the cops... It might even be Chiu Kwai's dirty trick. Anyway it's all Kwong's fault. It's you and him. Me? You're blaming it on me too? Whatever. I won't let anything happen to Kwong. I won't let you pass. Without me, what can you do? Give Kwong a chance. Silly girl, the reason I'm going to Macau now is just because of Kwong. Load Nip, please forgive me and forgive Kwong. You don't have to tell me what to do. Thank you for saving my life. Now you should see Chiu Kwai snatched the watches, shouldn't you? It's said that you were in the army in Jinmen before. I was in the army in Xiamen. Do you believe it? I even ate the airborne chocolate from your side. I've been in Hong Kong for six years already. I swam to Hong Kong with my lover. She was bitten to death by sharks. I hope she knows I'm still single. Are you married? Is here the South China Sea? I don't know? How do I know? Exactly. I don't even know where I am. How can I get married? Right? People like the two of us will only involve others into troubles. It's just fine if we die. We're not the only one. I can't go back to Mainland and you can't go back to Taiwan. Why don't you and me team up and go do something big? You're from the Mainland. You're of Mainland gang, while I'm of Taiwan gang. You want a united front? Did you kill the Hunan guy? You want me to be responsible for it? That's true. I stepped on him. He was spared the pain of being burned to death. That's good! A clean death! Bullshit. I'm gonna take my revenge on the old man. Fuck. Lord Nip. We're still powerful enough in Macau. There's no way the Immigrant gang can mess with us here. Just let us finish the game. Thanks to your help, the greenhorns haven't got the upper hand. We're ally and brothers. Only older guys like us stick to the principle. We all know it. I didn't expect Chiu Kwai turned against you. Until so many years later. He deserved what he got! Let's go. Chiu Kwai turned against the old man, -but he old man blamed it on us. - Yes. Sue, calm down. Yes, wait till I come back. Remember, listen to my words. Bye now. Let's go. Wan! Wan! Wan! Over there! The bird is over there! Let's get it! It flies to your side. It's up there... Sue, I tried to talk it over with my old friends. But it's too late. Chiu's sacrifice really upsets me. Kwong was already capable. But he made too much trouble in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau. Even God can't save him. There's one over there. Be quick! Swallow them all for me. It's none of your business. I don't care about Chiu Kwai's death. But I've begged you to give Kwong a chance. You have promised me, haven't you? We can talk it over. Let go of me. Are you crazy? Tell them to get out of here! Don't force me. Ching. - Ching! Ching! - Go! Take it easy! Go! I'm here.
