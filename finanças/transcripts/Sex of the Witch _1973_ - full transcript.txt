It will all be over soon. I only see fading shadows. It's all getting blurry. Shadows who seem to move before taking human shapes. They are my nieces and nephews. I can still make out their features, but I feel like I'm seeing them in a dream. They are all standing around my bed, witnessing my passing. Even if I can't see them, I know their sullen faces too well. I can still feel their discomfort, and imagine those faces who look barely alive. They could never understand what dying really feels like. Except for Susan, perhaps. Yes, I proudly lay claim to my impending death, as I've nurtured it, to the point of not being able to discern its face from my own. I die happy. I can feel the cold wind of death traveling across my body and making it numb. It's like a sweet warmth that fills me with joy. It even allows me to forget about the hideous glare of my daughter Evelyn. My degenerate child. Someone who's wasting her miserable life harboring grudges towards her relatives. I'm leaving this world with pride, taking with me the prominence of our family name: Hilton. Despite laying in my deathbed, I somehow have the impression I'm fleeing death. When it reaches me, we'll explore dark beyonds looking for the secret of life. They're the real corpses here. They are grim, lifeless ghosts. They are the shallow youth of today's world. Yes, shallow and distorted. They bear the empty expressions of those who live without striving for a fate. People who had their past robbed from them. I loved no one but myself, and rightly so. No, it wasn't narcissism. I felt it was my duty, in order to live a truthful life. It's all coming to an end, including all those memories I thought spared from my suffering and my regrets. Alas, it's not only me who's passing. I am, however, certain of something. The Hiltons will soon be no more. The shame upon our legendary family name will be too much! Yes... Don't stop... Yes... I'm dying with pleasure... Let us pray. O, Lord, please take the soul of our departed brother Thomas Hilton. Forgive his sins and grant him eternal rest after a life of sacrifices. We commend to you, Lord, the soul of your servant who has left this earth. May your merciful hand cancel all the sins his human weaknesses led him to commit. Lord, allow him into your kingdom, and let him sit at your side in the Heavens. Amen. I wanted to give you my condolences, it's a great loss for us all. I'll miss him, Ms. Susan, believe me. Thanks, Tony, I know you were very fond of him. Take care of everything. Susan, we're going to town for a bit, you coming? No, Edward, thanks for asking. The nerve of some people! And don't get me started on that priest! I mean, who would have thought. You think you know someone and then... Unbelievable. How can he associate himself with someone like Simon Voskin? - It's shameful! - Oh, give him a break. They get along with each other. I guess he has a thing for homosexuals. A bit like our poor, dead uncle. I'm sure our degenerate of an uncle included him in the will. - Maybe, maybe not. - You can bet on it. - Mark my words. - What if he did? - It would be dreadful! - Cut it out, Lucy. It's all speculation. And it's not like it wouldn't be right. He's always been loyal to him. You're wrong, Edward. They were lovers. He had an affair with Ingrid, too. Still has, actually. - Good morning, Aunt Evelyn. - Hello, Ingrid. I'm sorry I couldn't come sooner, but Uncle Thomas has died. I've been told. Only you and I know the family secret now. Stop pulling, Twinky, be a good dog! If I'm not mistaken, the only people missing are Ms. Ingrid and... Oh, here's Mr. Voskin. Simon Voskin. I'm sorry to keep you waiting, but it's essential you're all present. Ingrid will be here soon. My sister is on time, usually. Very well, we'll wait. Sorry I'm late. I think we're ready to begin now. "These are my testamentary dispositions: my estate, which includes properties in Worcestershire and across England, must remain intact without exceptions. The heirs, including my loyal secretary, Simon Voskin, will benefit from the aforementioned estate in equal measure. The usufruct of said properties will be administered by Mr. Thompson, who'll be able to choose a substitute administrator whenever he wishes to. He is entrusted with sharing the assets annually, on the anniversary of my passing. The heirs will receive their part of the estate once they reach thirty years of age. If one of the heirs dies before that time, their shares and usufruct benefits... ... will be distributed evenly amongst the surviving relatives. This agreement will stand until the assets will have been completely redistributed. I also wish to exclude my daughter Evelyn from the will, minimum amount established by law excluded, in order to punish her unjustified hatred against the other family members. I, being of sound mind and body, have personally written this document. I declare that my attorney has personally attested the validity of this will. You can hereby find every further legal detail along with our signatures. ‚Äù Johnny will be the first. He'll be thirty in one month and five days. See you tonight, agreed? Imagine if old Sir Thomas found us now! In his bed! - But he never will! - Hush, stop talking nonsense. You push me to my limits, I'm already agonizing over you... I'm sure we'll be great friends. - Hey. - Hi. You like her? Ingrid gave her to me. Twinky, behave. A beautiful doggie. - A very nice gift. - Absolutely. I had a dog like her years ago, how different things were back then. Those were good times, fond memories all around. I would have said the same, Susan, if it weren't for your aunt Evelyn. If I try to look back, all I see are ghosts. I just need to stop thinking about it. Try to forget. Easy for you to say, but for a Hilton it's almost impossible. For a Hilton, looking back is just like looking forward. Ghosts are everywhere. I often have strange premonitions, though I don't know why. So did your uncle. He tried to tell me something before he died. Something unpleasant, I guess. Yes, actually. He said one of his relatives would destroy the family after his death. - Did he say who? - Yes, your aunt. - Evelyn? - That's right. And it seems like there's a secret no one knows about between her and Ingrid. I mean, it's not unlikely considering the bond she has with her aunt. The strangest part of this story was your uncle describing a breast scar you have, which was caused by your aunt when you were little. No, it was an accident caused by Ingrid while we were playing. Well, I guess I got it wrong. All's well that ends well. No, it was an accident caused by Ingrid while we were playing. No, it was an accident... It was an accident... It was an accident... - No trace of the weapon so far. - I don't expect to find it. The first blow hit the victim on the forehead. He may have recognized his Killer, despite being rather intoxicated. It looks like he was bludgeoned with an iron club. Some kind of a medieval weapon. He was caught by surprise, so he had no chance to defend himself. I agree. No doubts about that. They all said they've never seen that kind of weapon around the house. What a ghastly death, right, Inspector? Judging by the blood and the position of the body, he probably leaned against the wall after the first blow. He fell on the floor immediately after. No one inside must have heard a thing. Pretty thick walls. Look. I want to know who these Javanese nails belong to. All right. Rest assured, I'll be the one who'll find the murder weapon. The inspector always brings me along because I'm such a good hound! That clause in the will is an excellent motive. Therefore, each of you could be the murderer. I'm sure the culprit will do his best to lie his way out of my investigation. Let it be clear, though, that I won't leave this house until I find the murderer. So, you said you two spent the night together? That's right, Gloria spent the whole night with me until six this morning. You can believe me, Inspector. I've no reason to lie to you. Tony is right, Inspector. We spent the night together till six. I'm telling the truth. I see. Excuse me, Inspector? I have a scheduled appointment with my doctor. I had to undergo some medical examinations three days ago, as a matter of fact. Very well, but make yourself reachable at all times. Boy, what a mess. How am I going to find that damn murder weapon? You're pretty quiet, aren't you? I feel like I'm talking to myself all the time! Whatever. You know I always liked you, without ever enquiring about your weird habits. You know my loyalty to the family is born out of my love for you all. - A bit too much love, perhaps. - I'm not ashamed of anything I've done. I've never hidden it, and I've never cared about your relatives' moral values! Can you say the same? Unfair question from someone who knows me like you do, Simon. I'd feel like suffocating if I couldn't live life my own way. THE MURDER WAS A PLOY TO FOOL THE INVESTIGATION! SEARCH OUTSIDE THE VILLA! It's a ruse, the culprit wants me to focus the investigation somewhere else. - When did you find that message? - Last night, in the library. I was in the library last night but that message wasn't there. Jeez, the face of that guy... Let's not be deceived by appearances. It may look like we're apparently dealing with a hapless murderer. But such a large inheritance is too obvious a motive. Yes, we're actually dealing with a cunning individual, far smarter than we think. The inheritance is not the motive! Or, to put it better, not the only one. I have yet to unveil the other reasons behind the crime. Listen, Inspector, I don't mind collaborating with you, but I can't stand all these speculations towards the Hiltons! I understand your position, Thompson, and I'd rather agree with you. Unfortunately, the way this story is untangling leaves me with no doubts. If it had been a stranger, we'd be unsure of the reason behind the crime. The culprit would have killed the victim in here, but why take such a risk? That's right. I hope you'll find the murderer soon, Inspector. Otherwise we'll keep suspecting each other forever, aside from the killer not receiving a deserved punishment. Well, Inspector, isn't it odd the murder weapon hasn't been found yet? We'll find it, don't worry. We're searching everywhere. - I'm sorry, but I'm a very busy man. - I understand. - Is that your car? - Yes. Don't leave town without telling me first. You know I haven't made much progress in solving the case, so my initial assessment about the killer being one of you still stands. Well, thanks for including me among the suspects, I guess. Anyway, I'm always at your disposal, Inspector. Always willing to help you with the investigation. In all fairness, though, I think you're looking in the wrong place. Perhaps. I have a question concerning that strange card, by the way. Who might have sent it, in your opinion? Why so late? Like all the other times? I hope you'll like this music, the selection isn't too varied here. Poor Sir Thomas had very peculiar tastes. He loved classical music. It was very akin to his character. If there's no further developments, Inspector, it's pointless keeping us here. What's your point? If you think it's someone in this room, just tell us. - Don't keep us on our toes. - My cousin's right, you can't do this. If you've got nothing concrete, no clues, no evidence, then... Then, what? I'm investigating a murder case. I can't show sympathy for any of you, whether you like it or not. I'm here to catch a killer, not to keep you confined out of spite. I have a strong feeling the killer is in this room. Here, amongst you. I felt her knee touching mine... I felt the impulse of undressing her... I craved to run my hands over her soft skin... I wanted to take her with gentle, tender violence... For an instant I noticed she wanted it too. I felt it was only a matter of unleashing my impulses... Renata looked at me with intense, frightened eyes. Her semi-open mouth was letting out soft breaths... She did nothing to escape the tight grip of my hand. She gave me a scared look, but I didn't give her time to think, nor understand. I tore off her clothes right before kissing her with passion... I held her tight, frantically feeling those perfectly firm, round breasts of hers. My fingers caressed her skin gently, searching her sex. You'd better stop reading our family history or you'll arrest us all! Don't give me that funny look. We have plenty of ancestors who fell afoul of the law, or who maybe weren't that fond of ethical values. Take Sir Eric Hilton, for instance, who was a pirate with rapist tendencies. He killed his wife in her sleep, using two Javanese nails. He's got nothing on the real pride of our family, though. I'm talking about Lord Conan Hilton. You should read aunt Evelyn's dissertation on him, believe me. He was neither pirate or rapist. We could say he was a different breed of criminal. He discovered a compound capable of altering the cellular equilibrium. Human cells, I mean, thus altering one's features. He could completely change the appearance of any individual. Very interesting, I'll give it a read for sure. This Lord Conan Hilton must have been an outstanding guy, with all his mutating cells experiments. It's been a long day for both of us, we should get some rest. Don't forget to lock yourself in. Better safe than sorry. - Excuse me, Miss? - Yes? Why do you only sculpt human subjects in erotic poses? It's my specialty. Be quiet, Twinky! Darling... - It's time we make a decision, darling. - Be quiet, please. - We must do it. - Stop talking, Edward. It's not safe. You're my love. You jealous doggie! "The murder was a ploy..." "The murder was a ploy..." Don't struggle. Keep quiet and I won't hurt you. Who are you? The rings are missing. - Who took them? - I don't know. The inspector, maybe? Good morning. Well? You guys had a pleasant night? I had the worst nightmare, I thought I was going mad. Someone was chasing me in the basement of the villa. I tried to escape, but then this pursuer started bashing my skull with an iron club. Well, well. Would you care to tell me what you were just talking about, Miss? We finally found the murder weapon. It only takes a little patience, Marchi, but even nightmares can become real. Isn't that right, Miss? You must trust me, Ann. Your peace of mind is very important to me. You know I mean it. I want you to be happy. Most of all, I don't want you to make any irreparable mistakes. I'm your brother, Ann. I'm the only person in the whole world you can rely on. The only one, Ann, mark my words. Johnny's always on your mind. You keep thinking about him, but he'd have never been the right man for you. Yes, he died a horrible death, but deep down we know he deserved it. Marchi! - Stay here, don't leave the villa. - Yes, Inspector. It's a crime that makes me feel utterly indifferent. Nat confessed he'd planned to kill him before. He just couldn't stand the idea of anyone else being with Ann. He had a morbid jealousy for his sister. I've never particularly liked neither Johnny nor Nat. They always annoyed me, in all fairness. - He used this entrance. - And he went through the service door. Nat is an odd guy. You know, out of all of us he's the only one I don't remember as a child. It was tough news to bear... But our family has always fought tragedies and accusations with utmost dignity. I'll try to help him, I hope I'll be able to spare him a life sentence. - He'll need a good lawyer. - What a family. Look at Ann... She always seemed the most level-headed one, and now she crumbled without dignity. Not to mention Lucy and her inexplicable behavior. I mean, she told the inspector about those strange dreams of hers. A bunch of nonsense. She never had any character, that's for sure. Her saving grace was telling the inspector about Nat probably being the Killer. And she was very fond of Nat, mind you. I admit I'd have never expected it from her. It's not the same thing, not at all... There's a big difference between the old guy and these young, so called, gentlemen. Their crimes are a far cry from what a real Hilton would have committed. Yet, after all, it's still shaped by their attitude to crime. The inspector left thinking he's solved the case. How wrong he is. I know for sure this is when things will really start to go down. You'll see. I've pursued evil throughout my entire life. I was unconsciously attracted to and fascinated by all that is perverse. The wicked, venomous blood of the Hiltons runs deep into my veins. Cold, black and filled with horrors, it gloriously flows inside me. I'm like a goblet filled with both darkness and light. I hate the Hiltons with immeasurable passion. My greatest pride was giving birth to a slithering creature... ... whose act destroys them down to the bone! You're my creation, I've instilled in you all of my decadent, evil teachings. This is just a terrible, wicked game whose cycle starts constantly over. You are nothing but a being without a will nor a soul. A creature in which I've instilled all my sinful, diabolical ways. A being who will carry out my most macabre desires. Perfect. A cognac, please. - How much? - 300 lire. It's all coming to an end, including all those memories I thought spared me from my suffering and regrets. Alas, it's not only me who's passing. I am, however, certain of something. The Hiltons will soon be no more. The shame upon our legendary family name will be too much! You asked too many questions. It's time to die. Don't scream if you want to live. Don't try to escape. I'll make it pleasant, so pleasant you'll feel you're about to die. Come on, stop that. Be quiet, I said! Twinky! Twinky, where are you going? No! No... Don't be scared, Susan. Who are you? I'm not going to hurt you, unless you make me. Twinky didn't bark because she recognized me. I gave her to you, remember? You? Ingrid, open up! Open the door! Open it! - What's wrong? What happened? - Ingrid! Ingrid! Ingrid! Ingrid! I know who you really are! Your trail of violence is finally over! Murderer! This way, let's go! Ingrid! Ingrid! Ingrid! Come on, hurry! Ingrid! No, don't shoot! No! No, Ingrid... No! Why... Why... Take me away, Edward, I implore you. Let's go, Susan. Come on. Subtitled by Francesco Massaccesi
