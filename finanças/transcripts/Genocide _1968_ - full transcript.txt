Joji. Charly, what??s wrong? Don??t send me back to the front! Charly, pull yourself together! What is it? Charly! I don??t wanna go! Don??t send me back there! I won??t go! I don??t wanna go! Drugs... gimme drugs. Give him an injection. -Captain! Come look at this! -What/sit? A swarm of insects! Starboard engine on fire! Cut the engine! What??s our position? Joji. Parachutes! We don??t have details yet, but it seems a B-52 bomber carrying an H-bomb has crash-landed somewhere in the Anan Archipelago. You will all commence with Operation Broken Arrow at once. Lieutenant Colonel Gordon... I??d like you to assemble a search party to look everywhere until that bomb is found. Yes, sir. These skeletons are crumbling. Captain, take it slow. Get away from me! If you hadn??t flipped out, we could??ve avoided that swarm. Give me some water. -Me too. -Get away! Where are we? Joji isn??t back yet? No, he??s still out collecting insects. You two just got married. Why does he leave you alone all day? He??s obsessed with rare insects. Sure it isn??t an insect with smooth white skin? What??s that supposed to mean? Stop it! Let me go! Damn it! What??s all this about? I??m Lieutenant Colonel Gordon, U.S. Air Force. Some islanders saw some parachutes falling. That??s good news. Where did they land? On Kojima Island. I??ll take you there by boat. Over there! -He??s alive. -What could have happened? He probably fell down that cliff. -Let??s go inside. -Come on. Those are some nasty wounds. Could they have died while bailing out? No, somebody did this to them. -Someone killed them? -I can??t be sure. I??ll do an autopsy right away. Who could do something so brutal? -Here. -I don??t want one. Hey there! Wanna buy a watch? You can have it cheap. Just 10,000 yen. -That??s a U.S. Air Force watch. Whered you get it? Who cares? Did you get it off one of those pilots who parachuted down? I don??t need stolen goods! Suit yourself. -Yukari! -Jojil Where have you been? I??ve been worried about you. Going from island to island, gathering insects. Is that really what you were doing? What??s gotten into you? Don??t go getting suspicious. I told you: I??m gathering insects for Dr. Nagumo of the Tokyo Biological Research Center. I??m tired from hiking all day, so stop getting on my nerves. I??m sorry. There are lots of ways.-- a man can get tired out, eh? -What? I hear you have a plump white butterfly on one of those islands. Son of a bitch! Stop it, Joji! You??re choking me! Joji, please stop it! I??ve got something important to tell you! What??s going on here? Nothing at all. Is there a problem? That??s him! I hear you??ve got a U.S. military watch. Well? Let me go! Joji, have you done something wrong? I haven??t done anything wrong! I??d like you to come down to the station. I swear I haven??t done anything! Are you saying you just found this on Kojima Island? You??re lying! You killed the pilot and took it! You didn??t find it! -You??re wrong! -You killed two men to get it! You??re a goddamn murderer! I??m not! I swear I??m not! Dr. Nagumo... a telegram came for you. What happened to it? This insect??s poison attacks the central nervous system, causing madness and death. There are many insects we still don??t know much about. This is one of them. A young man named Joji Akiyama sent it to me from Yatsushima. This is from him. He??s been arrested for murder! Dr. Nagumo! -I got your telegram. -Please help us. Joji??s innocent. I believe him. There??s no one we can turn to here on the island. I??ll do all I can to help. Joji... thank you for the poisonous insects. They??re a previously undiscovered species. You mustn??t lose hope! Hang on for Yukari??s sake. Or did you really kill those men? No, I didn??t kill them! When I was on that island, I saw the plane explode and the parachutes open. Then I... I thought I??d sell the watch and buy something nice for Yukart You were alone at the time. Is that right? Tell the truth. Or would you rather be tried for murder? I was with a girl named Annabelle. Annabelle? There??s a reason for that, I presume. Don??t ask me to tell you more. -Chief. -Dr. Nagumo! Please help me! Don??t give up, no matter what. Got that? I??d like to see the pilots?? bodies. I??m sending them to the base. Make it quick. They??ve been badly bitten by insects. Cause of death was cerebral hemorrhage from blunt trauma. But the wounds to the jaw aren??t from being struck. Hard blows with a sharp rock could have caused those. I??d like to see the black airman. Your friend??s guilty. You??re wasting your time. -He??s still unconscious? -Yes... but at times he mumbles deliriously. ??Insects, insects...?? ??Insects??? Insects.-- If he comes to, he may be able to help prove Joji??s innocence. I agree. Who are you? Dr. Junko Komuro. The Red Cross sent me. Pleased to meet you. I know Joji well. He wouldn??t kill anyone. Hey, sweetie.-- how about waiting on us? Dr. Nagumo! Joji??s doing fine. I asked the police chief to let you visit him. Hey, Doc, welcome! Thank heavens for that plane crash! Tourists weren??t coming here, and I thought I??d have to close the bar and hotel. Hey, flyboy! Was the plane that crashed a fighter, or was it ?? No comment. And the cause of the crash ?? Oh, I bet that??s a ??no comment?? too! -It isn??t safe to go out anymore! -Shut up! ??Shut up??? Come on now, these guys are Japan??s allies. We all gotta get along. -And now for foreign news... locusts have been destroying crops and forests, spreading rapidly across all the states in India Assam??s food supply has been devastated -That??s odd. -Dr. Nagumo... it??s not that unusual. Don??t India and Africa often have outbreaks of locusts? But this isn??t locust season. This is the first I??ve heard of an outbreak out of season. What a pleasant surprise! What brings you here today? What will you have? -A brandy. -A brandy? Coming right up, Miss Annabelle. Charly! Insects! Insects! Insects are nothing to be afraid of. Insects! Insects! I can??t stand them! What??s the matter? A big man like you, afraid of a bug! But I??m glad you finally woke up, Charly. Charly? Who??s Charly? Colonel, Charly??s regained consciousness. -I see. -But he??s lost his memory. Lost his memory? He must have hit his head falling down that cliff. In that case, it??ll be hard to continue with Operation Broken Arrow. Do all you can to help him get his memory back. Yes, sir. Operation Broken Arrow... -Annabelle? -Who are you? I??m Dr. Nagumo. I??ve come to prove Joji??s innocence. Joji??s innocence? Why won??t you testify in his defense? Testify? I don??t know what you??re talking about. He told me he was with you when it happened. I do know Joji. I asked him to collect insects for me. -You too? For 20-odd years, these islands didn??t belong to Japan, so they reverted to a natural state. It??s a rare environment. You could say it??s an insect paradise. But people will soon return in large numbers and disturb the natural balance. What will become of the insects then? We can already see that people will destroy them. Are you a biologist too? No, I just love insects, because they never lie. I don??t trust people. -Why not? You??re Japanese. Can you have forgotten what happened here two decades ago? Of course not. No Japanese person can forget that. One of the Pacific War??s fiercest battles was fought here. Human beings are about to repeat the mistakes of that time. Annabelle... the world is indeed filled with chaos and danger, but we??re not about to wage a final war of annihilation. Are you that naive? No, I just have faith in people. Well, I don??t! I take it the war took its toll on you. It left deep scars, scars nobody could ever forget. Scars nobody should ever forget. One should fan the flames of such hatred. Here. I??m going to have a baby. -We??re going to have a baby. -Are you sure? Yes. Dr. Komuro examined me. She says I??m three months?? pregnant. What??s the matter? It??s your child. Aren??t you happy? What??s going on? I??m going to be a father... and be tried for murder. What??s going to happen to the baby? Why didn??t you tell me sooner? You were away on Kojima for so long. I wanted to tell you the happy news as soon as possible. Leave them alone. Insects have babies too. That??s why I asked you not to capture them. That??s the only way we can earn a living! I??m being sent to Tokyo to be tried for murder. I??m done for! Joji, don??t lose hope! Dr. Nagumo will save us. I??m sure of it. Charly??s amnesia isn??t improving. Colonel Gordon, why do you need him to get his memory back? Is it to prove Joji??s innocence? I doubt it. Joji??s no more than an insect to you. What??s your point? You want Charly??s memory back to figure out where your H-bomb landed. Are you a spy for the Eastern bloc? Can??t you people see things any other way? You divide everyone into East and West! Don??t dodge the question! I??m just trying to prove a young man??s innocence! I??m sorry. I take that back. But how did you know about the H-bomb? I??d heard that Operation Broken Arrow is U.S. Air Force code for nuclear weapon-related accidents. Please keep that confidential. But what if plutonium from the H-bomb irradiates the surrounding area? H-bombs are equipped with 40 fail-safes. No radiation will leak out. Then why are you so anxious to find that bomb? I don??t have time to argue with you. In any event, though our goals differ, we both want Charly to recover his memory. Don??t worry. There??s nothing to fear. We??re ready, sir. Then let??s start. Hold Charly down. Please begin. Stop! The insects are coming! They??re gonna kill me! Where are the insects? No! No! Whyd you go in that cave? Did something terrible happen? Charly, try to remember. It??s dark. I can??t see a thing. -Where? In the cave? And then? What did you do then? Light... There was a light in the darkness. Insects! So insects killed those men. It was a hallucination. He??s a drug addict. A drug addict? He started taking drugs to ease his fear of combat and got addicted. That??s why I think he??s describing hallucinations. -Poor guy. -We??re fighting for freedom! We??re spilling our blood for freedom and independence! Can you be certain your war is just? Nagumo! I??m going to go see that cave for myself. I??ll show you the way. Where??s that bomb? Where did it land? Answer me! Where??s the H-bomb? If we don??t locate it before the world finds out, we??ll look like fools! Now tell me! Insects attacked our plane! They made us crash. Damn fool! You??re hallucinating again! It??s true! Insects brought us down! -Colonel, we found the plane. -And the bomb? We??re still searching for it. That??s strange. There are no insects anywhere. So it was a hallucination after all? I don??t think so. I??m afraid. The insects are gone. This is used for raising poisonous insects. It??s recent. Someone??s been here. Dr. Nagumo! It??s just a scratch. Somebody??s been up to something in this cave. If we figure out what it is, we can prove Joji??s innocence. Joji! Don??t go yet! Please wait until Dr. Nagumo returns! Yukari! I??m resigned to it now. -What are you saying? -That??s enough. Let me have one last look at the sea. I may never see such a beautiful sight again. It??s so beautiful. I??m going to escape. I??ll be damned if I just let them kill me. For your sake and the baby??s, I??m going to make a run for it. Stop! -Stop or I??ll shoot! -No, don??t! He??s getting away! Stop! No, don??t! -Why all the commotion? -The bastard got away. Joji escaped, the cocky bastard. Annabelle... help me, please! It??s Charly. His memory??s returned. -Where??s he going? -That??s none of your concern. It is. He??s a witness in a murder investigation. We can??t prove Joji??s innocence without his testimony. We have questions for him too. Go on. Now! Don??t shoot! Please don??t shoot me! There??s a bug. Annabelle... what do you do with the insects I catch for you? Joji, just do as I say. You can??t run away from me now. If you leave, you??ll be arrested and hanged for murder. No reason to get so startled. Oh, Dr. Nagumo... Charly??s got some guts, killing those MPs like that. Charly? Charly??s ill. I don??t think he has that kind of willpower. He??s a wild beast. He??ll turn savage if left unchecked. You??re the beast for thinking that way. Lay a finger on her again and you??ll be sorry! I get the picture. Help us out here. Don??t just stand there! Hold him down! You??re going to answer my questions. What kind of plane were you in? Come on... talk! Out with it! A bomber. And what was that bomber carrying? Son of a bitch! Stop it! Who the hell are you? Why are you asking these things? -Shut up! The U.S. Air Force is frantically searching for that plane. It must have been carrying a pretty important payload. Now.., tell us what it was! Hold it. That won??t make him talk. Annabelle, what are you going to do? -Annabelle ?? -Back off! -Annabelle ?? -Just shut up and watch! When these insects bite... within minutes your cranial nerves are paralyzed... and you go crazy and then die! -Stop! This is too cruel! -Get back! No human being would do this! That??s right, a human being wouldn??t... so I??m letting the insects do it for me! Are you out of your mind? Who did this to me? Who tattooed these numbers on me? You know what these numbers mean? They marked me for death at Auschwitz! My parents and siblings all died in Nazi concentration camps during the war. They suffered more than any soldier. They were tortured to death! Nazi soldiers made me their plaything, then branded me for death! Now you tell me to trust in people? I don??t trust human beings anymore. Help! -What was that plane carrying? -An H-bomb. An H-bomb? Please, quickly! -Where is it? -I don??t know! Tell me where the bomb is! Take the bugs out. I??ve got more questions. Not so fast! Get away from him. You got what you wanted. Now it??s time for my little experiment. Hey, let??s go tell the boss. The old man already went to bed. -What do you want this late? -A shot of whiskey. Whiskey? You??re a pain in the butt. I thought I heard a shortwave radio. I couldn??t sleep. I was fooling around a bit. I exchange messages with a foreign lady friend. It??s my one hobby. A fitting hobby for you. Good night. What is it? The door??s unlocked. ??Colonel Gordon: There are Eastern bloc spies on the island. They??re after the H-bomb.?? Call the base. Tell them to step up our underwater search efforts. Get out! He??s gone totally nuts. Things will get interesting now! I don??t know if having the baby is such a good idea now. You mustn??t try to get rid of it. But I??m afraid it won??t have a happy life. You mustn??t lose hope. Yukari... the baby isn??t just yours. Joji??s happy about the baby, isn??t he? Yes, but he??s ?? -What are you doing? -Let me go! Yukari, run! Don??t you recognize me? Please.., drop the gun. Dr. Nagumo! Charly??s got a gun! -What? He??s dead. Genocide.., genocide... genocide Genocide.-- the extermination of mankind. The insects are singing about destroying humanity. He??s been bitten. The bites are festering. What??s this about? He depended on me. I feel I let him down. It??s unbelievable. I don??t understand any of this. Insect eggs. The insects laid their eggs inside his body. Their eggs? That??s bizarre. Unbelievable! Insects don??t lay eggs in human bodies. The pilots in the cave looked exactly the same. They might have been filled with eggs as well. Their bodies were flown home. We could have a problem here. We??d better bury the body quickly. We found poison in Charly??s blood. A poison we??ve never seen. Here??s the analysis. That??s poison from an insect on this island. I??ve analyzed it in my lab in Tokyo. That reminds me: Charly said something odd. He said a swarm of insects brought down the bomber, but that??s impossible. Insects can??t fly at 30,000 feet. Perhaps... but something abnormal is going on in the insect world. Why did Charly mention genocide? Genocide... The extermination of mankind. Annabelle! Are you listening? Our government wants those poisonous insects at once! Not yet. You??re not sending a single one until I??m satisfied. You??re delusional. Who do you think is paying for your research? Don??t forget that the Eastern bloc is paying for all this. We??re taking them. I don??t care whether I live in a free society... or a communist one. What? I just want to breed vast numbers of insects that drive people mad... and scatter them all over the world. You??re crazy! Who??s the crazy one? Your plans for germ warfare are just as crazy. Go and see. Joji! If he tells Colonel Gordon, our work is ruined. Catch him! It??s me! It??s me ?? Jojil I??m so glad you??re safe. I??m sorry I made you worry. -Are you hurt? -No. Those two men from the fishing boat came looking for you. What??s wrong? Joji, where have you been hiding all this time? At Annabelle??s house. I was afraid of that. No! No! We??re going to have a baby, and yet you ?? You knew about her? I was wrong. Please forgive me. But I don??t love Annabelle. I hate her! -You??re lying. -I??m not! She??s not even human. She??s insane. She keeps poisonous insects and injects their poison into other insects to breed poisonous new species. She??s the one who made Charly go mad. If we don??t stop her, she??s going to kill everyone on the islands. I have to let Dr. Nagumo know, but they??re watching, so I can??t get near him. They??re here. Open up! Open the door! -Where??s Joji? -I don??t know. -Where??d he go? You bitch! If you don??t tell us ?? -Tell us! -Check over there. My baby will die! Lying bitch... Where did Joji go! Tell me, you bitch! Quick! Come here, you! Go tell the old man. I??ll take his wife hostage. Shit! She got away! Where??s Joji now? He uses huts around the island when collecting insects. He??s probably in one of those. He may get hurt in his haste to get away. We??ll get Dr. Komuro and set out at dawn. I need to wrap it. I saw it with my own eyes. Annabelle used Charly as her guinea pig. He was writhing in agony... screaming and on the verge of death. So she used him as her guinea pig. He spoke of exterminating mankind. It was a strange thing to say. Insect behavior has been abnormal all over the world. The damage they??re causing is spreading. Planes everywhere are flying into swarms and crashing. Genocide... the annihilation of mankind, the screaming of the insects. I can??t believe it??s all coincidence. But Charly was a drug addict. We can??t imagine the hallucinations he might have seen. Was it all his imagination, or was there something else to it? I want to find out. But how? I??m going to let those insects bite me. I??ll hallucinate just like Charly did. Dr. Nagumo! But you??ll go mad and die like Charly did! Dr. Nagumo, you mustn??t! No, I have to try. If this is injected within ten minutes, it should neutralize the toxin. Are you sure? It works on guinea pigs, but I don??t know about human beings. We don??t have much time. Joji, get that chair. Tie my legs tight. Make sure they won??t come loose. What time is it? 6:50 p.m. Joji, put one on my chest. Quick! Hurry up! Give me the antidote at 7:00. Go on. I feel dizzy... I feel like throwing up... Not yet! In exactly 10 minutes. Between my bones.., the insects... They??re wiggling between my bones. They??re coursing through me... The light... it??s coming... They??re running... Insects... The insects are singing. They??re talking. ??The Earth doesn??t belong to human beings alone. We don??t care if mankind destroys itself with nuclear weapons, but we refuse to let you take us with you. Destroy the human race! Genocide. Exterminate all humans!?? Dr. Nagumo! Dr. Nagumo. It??s hard to believe. I heard insects?? voices. Yet we have to believe it. They??re sensitive creatures. They fear nuclear destruction more than we do, so they??ve turned against us. Downing that bomber was their first attack on mankind. So the three crewmen, including Charly, were the insects?? first victims. Another one may be dying somewhere. Weren??t there just three parachutes? No, I??m pretty sure I saw... four parachutes. Four? Wait a minute. One of them came down really fast, and it glistened in the sun! Now I get it. That??s what Colonel Gordon and his men are after. The H-bomb. One of those parachutes was the H-bomb. We should tell Colonel Gordon right away. No, we have to stop the insects first. I??ll take you there. Doctor, call my lab in Tokyo right away. Have them make large quantities of antidote. All right. Take me with you. I??m tired of being alone. Son of a bitch! Hold it! Hold it right there. You??re coming with us. You??re going to take us to the H-bomb. -I don??t know where it is. -Don??t give me that! Go on! Wait! Dr. Nagumo. I??m right here. Care for a drink? No, thanks. Go ahead. It??ll be your last drink on Earth. What? I hear you did an experiment on yourself. I want you to do it again, but without the antidote. Anabelle! Genocide. The extermination of man. That??s what I??ve been waiting for! -Why? The human heart holds nothing but hatred. Our history is a cycle of hate and war. We know nothing of love. We only know hatred! Annabelle! You don??t know what hell those camps were or how I feel. Pull out the bed! -Listen to me! Don??t move. I keep my poisonous insects in the basement. You??ll be my fourth living subject. Fourth? It was you who killed those airmen? That??s right. I was hatching eggs in that cave. The two of them showed up, so I used them as guinea pigs. But that experiment was a failure. The poison acted too quickly, so their suffering was brief. I??m also the one who shot at you in the cave. You??re as toxic as your insects! Hurry up and move the bed. Open the trapdoor. Hurry it up! What is it? There it is! The H-bomb! They??re getting away! Stop where you are! Stop or we??ll shoot! Too late! The insects are gone. Still don??t believe it? I don??t care about insects. I just don??t want those spies to find the bomb. This is all happening because both sides persist in your senseless arms race. Don??t you understand? -Shut up! Burn this house down! Everyone out now! I??m afraid. The insects are killing the monkeys. Oh, no! Don??t look. What??s going to happen to us? We haven??t done anything wrong, but we??ll be killed anyway. Maybe I deserve to die, but you ?? -Don??t talk like that. -Yukari... I??ve caused you nothing but worry. I??ve done nothing for you. Please forgive me. If I were reborn into this world, I??d marry you all over again. I know you??re a spy, you bastard! You??re a disgrace to Japan! Where are Joji and Yukari? Tell me! Okay, I??ll tell you. Please stop. They??re one island over, near where the H-bomb came down. Is that the truth? Yes, Matsunaga contacted me by radio. Matsunaga, Yokol, come In. Answer me! Matsunaga, Yokol, come ini /f you can hear me, respond! Insects. Over there too. And there too! Are you all right? We have to do something! Don??t try to stop me! Matsunaga, Yokoi, answer me! Answer me! Joji, Yukari! Answer if you can hear me. Dr. Nagumo, have you located them? There??s no answer. Did you contact Tokyo? Yes, but nobody would believe me. Humanity??s facing extinction, and now this! We??ll leave for the island at dawn. Joji, Yukari! Answer me! Get inside here. What about you? I have to protect you. I??ll fight them off to the end. You have to survive no matter what! Joji, I want to die with you! What are you saying? You??re carrying our baby! You wanna kill the baby too? Have our baby, all right? Get in! Once it??s safe, get off the island as fast as you can. Hurry! Watch out! Stay down there! Yukari, you must survive! Live on without me! This is the aftermath. There??s a hut over there. How did this happen? How? Yukari! Yukari, hang on! You survived. Where??s Joji? Don??t look. It??s better not to look. Don??t look. Dr. Nagumol Come with me. What is it, Colonel Gordon? Look at that. -Is that a tornado? -No, insects. Insects? You still don??t believe me? It??s the revenge of the insects. I understand now. Nagumo, we need you. Come with us to the base. -I don??t have time. I have to evacuate the islanders and destroy the insects. Stop! You??re coming with us! What are you doing? Nagumo, we need you. Get in the jeep. -Dr. Nagumo. -I??ll be back. -Evacuate the island right away. -WhatlI happen to us? Can we destroy the insects? I don??t know, but we have to try. Hurry up! I promise I??ll be back. Yukari. Yukari, where are you going? To have my baby somewhere without any insects! To have Joji??s baby! It??s too dangerous! In your condition you??ll die out at sea! Nagumo.-- have a seat. -I don??t want to kill you. -What do you mean? You??re an expert on insects, aren??t you? You want the antidote. You catch on quick. That??s right. You aren??t the only ones who need it. The islanders do too! Not anymore. Why not? They??ll be dead in a few minutes. The H-bomb??s about to detonate. When we send a signal on the detonator??s frequency, it??ll explode. It??s our last resort to keep it out of enemy hands. That??s crazy! Thatli kill everyone on the islands! It??ll rain radiation on the rest of Japan. What will the Japanese do? Certain sacrifices must be made in war. Detonating it will wipe out the insects before they can spread and keep the bomb out of enemy hands. It??ll also protect our military secrets. It??s a small sacrifice to save the whole world! Superpower arrogance is what it is! All ready, sir. -No, don??t! -Don??t interfere! Try that again and I??ll shoot. -Don??t do it! -Back off! Hold it! What the hell are you doing? I refuse to be responsible for destroying the world. I??m not going to trigger a nuclear war! Colonel, watch out! Insects! We??ve flown into a swarm! THE END
