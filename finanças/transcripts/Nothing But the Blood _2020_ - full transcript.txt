"While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. With him was a large crowd with swords and clubs from the chief priests and the elders of the people. Now the betrayer had given them a sign saying, 'The one I kiss is the man, arrest him.' At once he came up to Jesus and said, 'Greetings, Rabbi, and kissed him.' Jesus said to him, 'Friend, do what you are here to do.' Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and arrested him. Suddenly, one of those with Jesus put his hands on his sword, drew it and struck the slave of the high priest cutting off his ear. Then Jesus said to him, 'Put your sword back into its place, for all who live by the sword shall die by the sword. Do you think that I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels? But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled which say it must happen in this way?'" Throughout your life, people will come to persecute you. They will tell you that you're doing evil, that your actions are causing harm and that everything you believe is falsehood. All this happened to Jesus. And when they came to persecute Jesus, he knew it was his Father's will. He knew that it was going to be okay in the end, and that this trial was temporary. And he knew that to fight against his attackers would be to go against God's plan. If you fight hate with hate, who really wins in the end? If you don't love your enemies, can you really call yourself a Christian? If you don't put away your sword when they come to crucify you, how can you still stand among the angels? Hmm. Think you can add to it? It's already 600 words on a high school baseball team. The boy hit a grand slam. And they still lost. Besides, he gives shit quotes. Yeah, he's not particularly loquacious. You really want me to add to it? - Na, I'll make it work. - It already works. - Hey, Dani. - Yeah. That story about the new home church, can I have it? I was gonna give that to Collin. Why the fuck would you give it to Collin? He can't write for shit. Well, I thought it would be a good learning tool. Baseball is a good learning tool. Why, you don't want to write about baseball anymore? I want an actual story, and this feels like the first one this town has had in a long time. All right, if you feel that strongly... - Perfect, thank you. - Okay. See ya. - Aren't you coming in? - Probably shouldn't. - Sorry. - I get it. You're a gentleman. Hmm. - Good night, Jessica. - Good night, Thomas. Emeth. It's Greek for truth. - Michael Hallback? - I am. And you must be Jessica Cutler. Please, come in. Ah, there's the little bugger. I'm so sorry, uh, new house, can't seem to find anything, we're not done unpacking yet. I've seen all this. Riveting. Whenever you are ready. I'm ready. So, 10 to 12 million people regularly attend home churches in America. What do you think accounts for that? Well, I think that there's a lot of people that attend church because they can remain unnoticed, they blend in with the big crowds. But that's not how God intends His relationship with us to be. You see, going to church is a very social activity and your bond with your fellow believers is incredibly important. And here at Emeth, it's our goal to foster that relationship between God and His followers, and to help them grow in their walk with Christ. You see there's strength in numbers. Speaking of numbers, this very small town already has a Catholic church, a Methodist church, a Baptist church and even a non-denominational church that meets at the Petersons house and gets out just in time for everyone to make it to the farmers' market. Everyone here is pretty set in their ways and anything new doesn't tend to last very long. What makes Emeth so special? Father used to tell us a story about an old western town. It's hot there, it's hotter even than here, and everybody was always looking for different ways to quench their thirst. They tried tonics and powders and what have you not, but nothing ever left them completely satisfied. And then one day a man came along and he built them a well. Water, real thing. See, Miss Cutler, when... when when you give people what they've always been wanting, they'll never need anything else. So you've come to our little western town to bring us Emeth? - Heh. I mean, if you want to put it that way. - I don't. - So your religious organization... - It's a church. It's been in the news many times for its controversial views and practices. Should we go over a few of those... Look, I know where you're going with that and those are very extreme cases and Emeth has dealt with them accordingly. - Heh. But you haven't... - Next question. How does it feel having a woman asking questions in your church? Excuse me? Well, because I know women are supposed to remain silent during services, that's in the Bible, right? Yes, those are God's words. "God's words." Is that how you justify the stoning of a divorced woman in one of your Ohio outlets? I don't have to justify anything to you. Let's see... Oh, let's not forget Emeth's notorious reputation for mercilessly harassing gay people. What passage did you pull from exactly when you decided to burn that gay couple's house? Those sinners got what they deserved. Adulterers and sodomites have no place in God's house. God hates all forms of wickedness, especially those who think they're above His chosen leaders. Okay. Fine, leave. You'll be back. You always come back. Did you only bring one of these? - What more do you want from me, heh? - Fuck. I'm gonna need like four more if I'm gonna get through this. Okay, well, you asked for it. Well, I didn't think she'd make me go back. You really thought Dani was just gonna let you write an article shitting all over the new church? You wanna come with me? No, I have to go to work and besides, it won't be that bad. I mean, how bad could it be? And, hey, maybe Thomas will be there. - Uh, yeah, I highly doubt that. - Oh, why not? Have you not talked to him? Well, no, we didn't exchange numbers. Besides, he's probably long gone. Well, whatever. I can hook you up with one of Sunset Acres' most eligible bachelors. I can think of at least two who've only groped me like once. Okay, I get it. My job's not that bad. Yeah, heh. Well, if you change your mind, you can always come work for me as a nurse's aide. - Yeah, I don't think so. - Oh, come on. Changing bedpans and opening Jell-Os all day doesn't sound like fulfilling career alternative. - You need more of this. - Yes, give it to me. Oh, it's all I wanted. Would you like some water? What, is the Kool-Aid not ready yet? Yeah, sorry. Thank you. Uh, do you have a bathroom? Hey. Thomas. Sorry, you walked in on that. So what's up? So is this why you couldn't come in the other night? No, no, Georgine is not a thing. No, no, I mean this. When was I supposed to bring that up, before or after you shat on religion? Okay, well, you also said you weren't gonna be in town long. Yeah, that part's true. I'm moving to the next town as soon as we're established here, all right. My brother's gonna take over the church here. I'm just here to help get the ball rolling. Right. Okay. You're not gonna tell anyone, right? No, I'm not gonna tell on you. From what I could see, it was all consensual, which is kind of a rarity for you guys, so... Yeah, and it's been at the center of some pretty fucked up shit. Okay. So, why are you a part of it? Pays really well. Come on, I know you're not that shallow. It's the only thing I've... I've known, all right, plus it gives me a platform that I wouldn't have otherwise. So I try to use that platform to do as much good in the world as I can. From everything I know about Emeth, I don't see how that's possible. You have to keep an open mind. You know, some people fuck in beds. You know I'd heard that. Problem is the bathroom is the only room in the house that doesn't have a camera in it. - What? - Yeah. Father put cameras in all the rooms except the bathrooms. He says it's to keep an eye on his congregation, but really I think it's just to keep the leadership in line from all those non-consensual acts you mentioned, which is sad really, you know. People do whatever they want when God's watching, but as soon as they figure out others are watching, they change their behavior entirely. This is all off the record, by the way. Hmm. Shame. Would have made a fascinating angle. Welcome. Welcome to all of you. I would now like to introduce our founder and our shepherd of Emeth. And he can't be here for long because he has many other places to go to help spread the ministry of Emeth. But we have him here today, which is the greatest blessing of all. Father... Welcome. Welcome all of you. God has brought all of you here... and God wants all of you to be here. And I can't wait to see what he has in store for you, here at Emeth. It won't be easy. God never promised that life would be easy, but it is ultimately the only way to happiness, to gaining His favor and eternal life with Him. None of you deserve to be here for you... We, are all sinners. But there is hope, hope eternal for even the wickedest of sinners. Together through fellowship and accountability, we can ensure that we reach paradise together and inspire others to join us. Hmm. We're lucky. We have a book that tells us exactly what we need to do in order to please Him. Simple rules, but rules that the world calls ludicrous fairytales. Politically incorrect, outdated. I assure you, there is nothing outdated about God. He is alive and well. And He is in this place. He is in this town. Like any father, He demands obedience. He demands that marriage be kept sacred, that we put nothing else before Him, that our bodies be kept His temple. Now in this town, there is divorce, there are people who don't put God first. There is extramarital sex, homosexuality, and children born out of wedlock. All of these things are an abomination to God and those that do these things, He abhors them and He has stricken their name from the book of life. But... there is a way to get our name back in that book. And that is what we're here to do. ♪ Rejoice the lord is king ♪ Fuck you. You talked about doing good with that. What good could possibly come from that? - It's disgusting. - I know. I know. All right. But that's not me. Bullshit. You're part of it, you're part of the whole fucking thing, guilty by association. Look you... You learn to justify stupid opinions like that or at least you learn to ignore them. It's hard to leave something I've known my entire life. I don't blame you for hating the things Father said in there. Can I see you again? How about now? So you're afraid to go back and face the wrath of Father? No. Just enjoying being here with you. The strange thing is though I'll still apologize profusely when I get back. Do you really feel like you're doing something wrong? Logically no. But like guilt just comes with the territory. Every little thing I do, it's this feeling that I can't shake, which sucks 'cause sex is awesome. Yeah, how do you reconcile that? I can't. But if there is a God, He's a lot more loving and open-minded than Emeth preaches. I mean, there's got to be more than one way to live your life, right? I mean, why should someone perish just because they lived a life different from everyone else. I wish I could be more like you. More definitive. That I could just write it all off without a second thought. You know, I used to buy into the whole thing too when I was young. But when I was in third grade, this boy in my church, he was just a few years older than me, said that the priest had touched him, yeah. And then a bunch of other kids, boys and girls, came out and said that he had done the same thing to them. You know what the church did? They moved him to another church, heh, like an hour away. One of the boys killed himself a few years later and still nothing happened to that priest. And this isn't a unique situation. That wasn't one bad guy doing a bad thing. And the church was complicit. And so, as part of the church, I was complicit. When I told my parents that, they kicked me out. I've been making my own way ever since. That's why I like coming out here. Why is that? 'Cause life is chaos, but you can choose to just walk out into that water, close your eyes and see what happens. There's something freeing about giving it into the chaos and coming out on top... if you're lucky. And if you're not? Then you're not. -Yeah. - It made so much sense though. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. - Maybe to you. - I didn't mean it like that, heh. - Oh, okay. Okay, maybe a little. Are you sure I can't give you a ride home? No, I'm fine. I prefer walking. Gives me time to clear my head and practice my apology. - Are you gonna go home? - I have to, eventually. Hmm, tsk. Well, do you want to come in this time? No cameras in here. Can I maybe get you a drink or something? - Hey. - Hey. - You want some breakfast? - Sure. So I'm gonna warn you, there might not be anything edible in my fridge, like at all. - Nothing... - Morning. Don't you two make a nice couple? Mighty nice. What the fuck are you doing here? Get out. Excuse me. You never changed your locks. You never even asked for my keys, so you must have wanted me to come back through those doors. Get the fuck out! Shh. Aren't you gonna introduce me to your new friend? I knew you'd move on but I had hoped you would be with someone who wasn't so beautiful. It's time for you to go. That's funny 'cause, uh, I was thinking the same thing about you. Boys. Seth, do not do this please, I beg you. - Hey, hey. - What the... Hey! Hey! - Thomas! Thomas! - You son of a bitch! Fuck you! Fuck you! Stop it. You know, I never could figure out what I had to do to make you see that we were perfect for each other. Why can't you just see that? Hey, boss, what do you want us to do with him? Take him back where he belongs. Jessica. Jessica. So, you want to tell us where you've been? Look, we already know. Just own up to it. Hold your tongue. You spent the night with another. You're weak in the eyes of God and you have soiled your relationship with your betrothed. She's not my betrothed. Never agreed to that. It's about time somebody around here started thinking for themselves. Sit down. You think you can break God's rules and just get away with it? Haven't I taught you better than that by now? Yeah, sure. All right. Let's talk about God's rules. That book says we can't have bacon or shrimp. You can't trim your beard. No mixing meat or dairy. So I guess we're all going to hell for eating fucking cheeseburgers, right? No sex. But you turn a blind eye if it's the woman you want me to marry. How exactly do you choose which of God's rules we follow, Father? - If only your mother were... - No. No, you don't get to do that. My mother? I never knew my mother. You've never had a wife. Are the three of us even related? Oh, right, I forgot, we're not allowed to ask about that. We're not allowed to ask any fucking questions about anything at all. So, no, you don't get to guilt-trip me for shit. You don't have to stand there like I'm a sinner when you're nothing but a hypocrite. Repent. Or what? That's what I thought. I'll show myself out. Here's your water. I have to go to work but mom's here if you need anything. Oh, and your phone was ringing, I think you missed a call. Are you okay? Exactly where I wanna be. I love you. And I love you. Mama! You awake? Mama! It's okay. - She's gone. - I know. I know. Okay. - She's gone. - I know. This isn't the same room anymore. I've known this room my entire life. I've slept in here, played games in here. I even brought some boys in here because the bed was so much nicer than mine. Now everything is gone. It's just empty. Whom I gonna take care of now? Who's gonna take care of me? I'm not like you. I'm not self-motivated. I'm not good at being alone. You're stronger than you think. What am I supposed to do now, just throw myself into my work? Where's my bright outlook in that? You'll figure it out. I wish you could just tell me what to do. The girl with all the answers. I know. I wish I could too. I'm happy it was peaceful. I'm happy she was asleep when it happened. I know it's not gonna go back to being the same, but is it ever gonna be anything? You'll figure it out. One day you'll wake up and it won't hurt as bad, and it won't be so lonely. You'll go in that new direction. Tell me the plan again. We'll have a little baby girl and she will be the most beautiful thing that you or I have ever seen. I'll go back as assistant editor of the paper. You can stay home with our daughter while writing your stories. By the time our little girl turns six, we will be in a city too big for small-minded people to hurt us. She'll grow up and be who she wants to be, believe what she wants to believe, and love who she wants to love. No one will ever tell her that she is less than or not good enough. She'll have a life far better than you or I could ever imagine. And then you and I will grow old and wrinkly together, bound together by a closeness that no poet could put into words and no scientist could ever explain. - I love you. - I love you. ♪ Away in a manger ♪ ♪ No crib for a bed ♪ ♪ The little Lord Jesus Lay down ♪ ♪ His sweet head ♪ ♪ The stars in the sky ♪ ♪ Look down where he lay ♪ Hi, Thomas. Hi, Jessica. - Hello. - Hi. Jessica, you look incredible. I've never seen a more beautiful pregnant person before. Thank you. I know it's early but, ah, we got you a Christmas present. It's baby blankets. Uh, Michael actually picked them out. I just wrapped them. Thank You, Georgine, that's very kind of you. Ah. I hope the child enjoys them. And I wanted to let you both know that Michael and I will be getting married the weekend after Christmas. Anyway, I would love if you both could make it out. It will be at Emeth starting at 4:30. And I know Michael would be really happy to see you there too. Yeah, we'll... we'll check our calendar. Great. Well, happy holidays, heh! - Merry Christmas. - Bye. - At some point I'm probably gonna have to pee. - Mm-hm. Do you think it's safe to go in there at this time? Why, did you want the Emeth VIP bathroom experience? Yes. Yes, I do. We'll find a way to make that happen. Is that a promise? Good. - Hold me to it. - I will. - Okay. - Heh. Hi there. - Hi there. - She's really pregnant. - Yes, she is. - I am. - When's she due? - Next month. You're not wearing a wedding ring. That's because we're not married. Oh, poor child. Enjoy the wedding. I love you, Michael, and I know that you love me too. Because of this, I desire to be your wife, heh. For 20 years I have prayed that God would lead me to His choice and I am confident His will is being fulfilled tonight. Through the pressures of the present and the uncertainties of the future, I promise to be faithful to you. I will love, serve, and obey you as long as we both are alive. Christ told us, "The wife should submit herself to her own husband as to the Lord for as Christ is head of the church, so is the husband head of his wife." Michael, I submit myself to you. Georgine, I love you, and I know that God has ordained our love. Because of that, I desire to be your husband. Together we will be vessels for His service in accordance with His plan so that in all areas of our life, Christ will have preeminence. Through the pressures of the present and the uncertainty of the future, I promise to be faithful to you. I promise to love you, to guide you and to protect you as Christ did for His church as long as we're both alive. According to Ephesians 5 and the power enabled through him, I promise to love you as Christ loved the church so much that He died for her. And I will treat you as part of me because in His sight we will be one. I now pronounce you man and wife. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. and Mrs. Hallback. Hello, ladies. Wow, look at you. Isn't this just beautiful? A divine miracle. Oh, isn't this just beautiful? That's enough. Jess, you all right? - Yeah, I'm... I'm... I'm fine. - Try not to make a scene now, boy. Not on such a beautiful occasion. - You okay? - I'm fine. He's a very dedicated and passionate follower. Emeth is lucky to have him. He's an abusive creep. - He who repents... - Yeah, save it. Jess, why don't we go back to the reception? Oh, the reception is for members only, not for the unwholesome, not for sinners who shamelessly lure their adultery in front of others. You've made your choice. There's no reason to come back. I never wanted a wedding. When I was growing up, all the girls would talk about their special day and I just couldn't picture it for myself. I dreaded it. I had nightmares about standing next to someone I had no connection with. - And now? - Now I'm in love. I don't need rings or sexist vows. I'm here. I'm never going anywhere. - I love you. - I love you too. - Let's get the hell out of here, heh. - Yes, ma'am. All right, Jessica, get your ass out of here. You said you were leaving at 3:00 today, it's 3:30. Shit, okay. Um, I'm almost done marking Lisa's story and then I am out of here. Good. Dani, oh, my God, what happened? Oh, this? What, you don't like my new beauty marks? Dani, what happened? A few of your church friends paid me a visit last night. They threw rocks and bricks through my window. Oh. God, why? Do you remember that story that Collin wrote highlighting the women's clinic and the services they provide? Mm-hm. I added a little bit in there about how Emeth is protesting them as baby killers, which is interesting because abortion isn't even a service they provide. They didn't like that. You should report it to the police. I did. They couldn't prove who it was but it's pretty obvious to me. They put signs in our yard the other day. Apparently, the snide remarks and looks at the grocery store aren't enough anymore. And now they are dragging Arcadia into it. Oh. What am I supposed to do, just ignore it? How do you fight back against something like that? You'll be okay. You're almost away from them for good. But you're not. Yeah, I'd like to really see them try and fuck with me. So you got a good evening planned? Yeah, Katie's coming over. I haven't seen her in forever and we're gonna start planning Arcadia's birthday party. Oh, sounds fun. You and Collin are gonna be there, right? Wouldn't miss it. He might, though. I just... I never know what's going on with that boy. - I'll give this to Lisa. - Thank you. You're welcome. How am I gonna run this place without you? Hey, you're gonna kick ass as usual. - Yeah. - I'll see you tomorrow. Hey, it's time for bed, pumpkin. Can you tell Aunt Katie good night? - Good night, Aunt Katie. - Good night, sweetheart. Wrap those arms. Okay, got it. Okay, let's go. Oh, no. Uh, what time is it? Um, I'm so sorry I have to go. - Uh... - Okay, bye. Katie. Katie. Hey, Katie. It's his last jab. Don't get angry. That's what he wants. They all want you to be upset. And why shouldn't I be? It's my fault. I knew something was off with Katie. Ever since her mom died, she's been drifting further and further away and I was too busy with you and Arcadia to be a good friend. - Fuck. - It's not your fault. Her choices aren't your problem. She's a grown woman. What matters is that her stupid decisions don't come back and hurt us. Yeah, okay. Mommy? - You want to take care of that? - She's calling you, man. I'll take the next one, I promise. Okay. What is it, baby? - Do you have a mommy and daddy? - Yes, but they live far away. Does daddy have a mommy and daddy? - He has a daddy. - Where is he? No, absolutely fucking not. - Just think about it, okay? - No. We can't project our issues with your family on to her, she doesn't know any better. I mean, we knew this would happen at some point, we talked about it. She can meet your family here and then my family at some point down the road. Okay, and what if she comes back and she wants to do Jesus shit? Then we let her do Jesus shit. We talked about that too. Of course, this would happen as soon as we're about to leave. Maybe it's for the best. I can watch her while we wrap her presents. When we finish setting up for the party, they meet her now and then we're gone. - We're gonna be back, you go to bed, okay? - Okay. - We'll be back. - Well, look who it is. No, not them. This is a major breach of our trust, Michael... We are leaving, Thomas. We're leaving. It's a beautiful little girl you got there. We show up 30 minutes late so you wouldn't pull this shit. We're sorry. We are very, very sorry and we are leaving. Uh-huh, it doesn't fucking look like it. Watch your mouth, boy. - What the hell? I thought we had an agreement. - Look, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. We just lost track of time. Is that Arcadia? Oh, hello there. I'm your Aunty Georgine. Hello. And look, this is your uncle Michael. Let's wave at him. Hi. So do you like teddy bears? What about puzzles? Great. Well, we're gonna go right inside, your grandfather's in there. He's so excited to meet you. We'll be back by nine. She usually passes out around eight. Okay. I'll let Georgine know. - She's quite good with children. - Yes, she is. She'll make a good mother. I do wish they'd hurry up and conceive. I'm afraid they're not trying as often as they should. All right, who's ready for dinner? Guess what we're having for dessert, Arcadia? Birthday cake. - Ah! Oh, yeah! - Yay, heh! Yes. It's chocolate.. I'll slip out while she's distracted. We'll be back at nine. Uh, thank you again. You know, you'll never learn unless you practice. You gotta let me master cutting the paper before I can move on to wrapping. Cut some paper then. I think, it went pretty well given how it all started. Yeah, me too. I think, Father watches them fuck. Oh, yeah, for sure. - Has he always done that? - I try not to think about it. - It's fucking gross. - Yeah. Did you see the bruises on Katie's neck? No, I didn't notice. He's just as much a piece of shit as always. She knew that. I just... I don't understand. Jess, there's nothing you can do for her right now. You know better than anyone else that she has to figure things out for herself and make her own decisions. All done. - And you didn't even need me. - Heh, that's true. Okay, just, uh, promise me that we're gonna hire a babysitter soon. - That is a promise. - And actually have a date night 'cause... Amen to that. - What the hell? - What's going on? - I have no idea. - Oh, my God. Something is wrong. Arcadia! Oh, Thomas. Jessica. - Georgine, what's going on? - We can't find her. We can't find her. - What? - I'm so sorry. - We can't find Arcadia. - Let me find. - You can't. - Let me find. - It's forbidden. - Watch me. - Arcadia. - Arcadia. No! No! She's asleep. - Is she... - She's great, Katie. Don't talk to me like that. - I'm only trying to be... - What, a friend? Is that what you think you are? - Well... - Don't pretend like you're not here on their orders, just to see if we've figured out what really happened. - Thomas, it was an accident. - You weren't there. - You just believe in what they told you. - You used to believe them too. You used to believe everything. Then you left. Are you really surprised by what's happened to you? The prodigal son has wandered off the path. Looks like that hurts. Good to know Seth is doing well though.. Her name was Arcadia. Katie, do you know that name means? Unspoiled paradise. And she was. She really, really was. And now she's gone. Why is that? Why? Tell me, Katie? She was all we lived for. Now she's gone. She's fucking gone. And the only thing keeping me from just fucking ending it... is that I need to know what happened. I need to know why my baby girl was taken from me. Why you people killed my girl? Katie, if you're in there, if Jess' best friend is still in there... you owe us answers. I know you've had a hard time lately. And you need to find a way to survive in this town, a way to feel loved and to be a part of something, and I'm glad you found it, I really am. But our little girl's dead. She's not coming back. You get to keep living your life, that's what we're gonna do. But it's gonna be really hard if we don't know how or why it happened. Katie, please. "Do not withhold punishment from a child. If you strike him with a rod, he will not die. If you strike him with a rod, you will save his soul." Did you want to come? What is that you want, Jessica? Is it... is it answers? I... Oh, there, there. That's what we're here for. We give people what they need even when they don't know they need it. Emeth has been so good to me. Emeth has given me comfort and purpose, meaning and it will continue to do that as long as it still stands long after you and I have left this mortal world. I swore an oath to my husband, an oath that binds me to stand behind him no matter what, even when that means standing behind his lies. Such as when he goes to bed with another man all the while preaching against the sins of homosexuality. Seth goaded my husband, his lover, into hitting Arcadia as punishment, something that had never happened to her before. She ran terrified from the house and Seth... What happened was horrible. I can't even begin to imagine the kind of pain that you're in. But again, he's my husband and I must submit to the life that he and God have chosen for us. But although I stand by his side, I must understand if God or one of His servants on Earth chooses to punish my husband for his wickedness. I've left a spare key in the flowerpot. I'll be gone this weekend visiting one of our new outlets. May God bless you and be with you. Jess. Jess, listen to me, okay? I don't want to lose you. But if you want to go, I'll help you go. Just tell me... Just tell me how to help. - I want... - Yeah. I want you to help me make it right. Jess, it won't bring our girl back. I know that, Thomas. I do. But I can't sit back and watch them ruin any more lives. They come here, they brainwash people, they hurt people. They're hypocrites and murderers. Yeah. We are better than that. Are we? Are we? You were raised to believe that there is some higher power that punishes people who do evil. But where is this justice now? They need to be held accountable. Remember what we always said, we'd be in this together forever, no matter what. As long as we had happiness together, we were good. And they took that away from us, time and time again. Please, I can't do this without you. Up, now. Now! Say hi to Father, everyone. Daryll, what are you doing here, man? It's nothing personal boss, she just pays better. Boy, you ever held a gun before? There's no fucking way he's held a gun before... Seth, please, this is the Lord's house. Oh, is that your main concern right now, my language? All right, I'll try. Well, don't you two make a cute couple. Don't give me that look, we know all about you two. What can I say, Jess, I'm a good fuck. What about him? Is he a good fuck? Doesn't look like it. Guy seems like a limp dick pussy. No wonder your hands are shaking on that fucking gun. You never had to do anything really your entire fucking life. Oh, what are you gonna... Right, right. So I know you're a stickler for the rules. Lot of verses in this book. Lot of verses about homosexuality. It's a punishable sin, isn't it? Personally, I think that's pretty extreme. It's so homophobic and hateful. There are so many worse things than loving people, don't you think? Seth, nothing? Hmm. But they aren't my rules. They're yours. And I know how important it is to Emeth that you be punished when you break... What was it, Michael, God's rules? Here's what's gonna happen. I'm gonna untie you. Then you're gonna take these and you're gonna stone this sodomite to death. God be praised. If you do this... hey, I promise, I won't kill you. But if you refuse... Get the picture? You're gonna have to do better than that. Again. Don't be afraid to get in there and bash his fucking brains in. Shit. That's very good. Very good. So Matthew 5:29. Do you know it? Tell me. If your... If your right eye causes you to sin, cut it out and throw it away. Very good. You know what to do. No. No! "Touch not my anointed and do my prophets no harm." The psalms, really? Now I... I fully support what you did to those boys. It was wonderfully rooted in scripture. And if you... if you need any help moving on from what happened, you have the full support of Emeth behind you. Remember what you used to say, Father, about how the boss is responsible for the actions of his employees and must be held accountable? That's you, Father. Guilty by association. "If anyone should cause of these little ones harm... it would be better that he have a millstone hung around his neck and that he be drowned in the middle of the sea." Matthew 18:6. This won't destroy Emeth. There are thousands, millions of us. We have no issue with them. We are concerned with those who've done harm to us and those that we love, the hypocrites who preach hate and intolerance, mass as a path to fulfillment.
