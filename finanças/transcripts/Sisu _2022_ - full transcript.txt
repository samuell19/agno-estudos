The Second World War is coming to an end. Finland and the Soviet Union have signed the Moscow Armistice which decrees that Finland must disarm the Nazis and drive them out of Lapland. The Nazis adopt a scorched earth tactic and destroy all roads, bridges, villages and towns in their path. Deep in the wilderness of Lapland, there is a man who has decided to leave the war behind him. For good. Yeah! He's riding to his death anyway. Get off the horse! Where do you think you're going, old man? There's nothing down there. We made sure of that. What do you got there? This old fucker is a gold miner. You got gold in those bags? Take a look at this! We're rich, boys! You're dead! Get down on your knees. These bags are full of gold! Get down on your knees, grandpa! Huh? Shoot the fucker! Fuck him up! Thanks for the gold! We've got gold! Thank you, old fuck... Wait. Now. Fire! Cease fire! Huh? You... and you. On the sides of the road, now! How many mines did we bury here? All of them. Pick two of our female friends and bring them to me. And some rope. You... and you. Pick me. Thank you, General. I will pass on the information. Over and out. The General, he has given us orders. Turn back and head to Norway from Finland immediately. Did you tell him he just killed seven of our men? I did. And? He thinks we were lucky. Fucking lucky. The dog tags belong to a man named Aatami Korpi. He was a Finnish commando. The most feared in his unit. The General said, and I quote, "He's one mean motherfucker "that you do not want to mess with." He fought in the Winter War. Lost his home and his family to the Russians. He became a ruthless, vengeful soldier who took orders from no one. The Finns, they gave up trying to discipline or control him. They just sent him out, alone into the wilderness to hunt Russian patrols. He became a one-man death squad. The reports are unconfirmed, but it looks like he has over 300 Russian kills. The Russians, they gave him a name. They call him Koschei, "The Immortal." Immortal? The road is clear, sir. We are going to follow our orders, right? We are turning back? No. We are not turning back. We are losing the war. We are. In a few months, this all will be over for us. When we get back, they will... Hang us all. That gold is our way out. Eyes open! Check the sides. Nothing here. Oh, wait, I see movement. Don't fall behind! Hey, hey... Hey! Gasoline! The dogs lost the scent! What's happening? There's gasoline on the road. They are useless! Calm down, boy! Hey! Release the dog. Release the dog! Go on, boy! Finish him. Immortal or not, a man needs air. Now, get me the gold. Go after him! Now! One more meter and I'll have you shot! Desertion is punishable by death. Fuck this. Hey! Come here. Find me a boat. Any last words? I didn't think so. For your troubles. Put the hat back on. This son of a bitch is still alive. Shoot the man and shoot the dog, too. And the dog! Shoot the fucking dog! Muller? Muller? The plane is ready. What about the rest of our squad? They don't need us to get to Norway. The boys have a crateful of booze and a truckful of bitches. I'm sure they'll figure something out. I would. The road is blocked. Come and take a look at this. What's going on? There's something in the road. Is this the plane? No, idiot. This is something else. The pilot has been hanged. - That's my rope. - What? That's the rope I used to hang Korpi with. Let's get the fuck out of here. I recognize it, I swear. What's the order? Everybody move! - Start the engines. - Come on, let's go. Let's go, go! Well? He's back. He's hanging from a rope somewhere. He's dead. - What's so fucking funny? - Nothing. What the fuck are you smiling for, then? Do you assholes really think you have succeeded where hundreds of Russians have died trying? We all know the story. You'll see what happens when you take everything from him. He won't give up. He'll just keep coming back. Do you really believe that he's immortal? No. He just refuses to die. We have a word for that in Finland, but it's impossible to translate. You see, this is not about who's the strongest. This is about not giving up. And he won't. Ever. No matter what you bitches are trying. You will make him stronger. So... what is so fucking funny, is that you... your boyfriend... and everything that is left of your sorry-assed company... are already dead. What? Was that one of ours? Was that Jens? We almost ran into the bitches. Can somebody tell me what the fuck is going on? Nothing. It's all good, sir. Sir. They're all dead. We are almost there. Step on it! Wolf. Go out there and kill him. One, two, three! Keep going! Keep going. Please... Please... That's him, that's Koschei. Do you see him? Yep. He's still down there. It's bad. It's bad, I need... If you're not dead, you fly this fucking plane! Did you hear that? It's nothing. Just an old plane. We might have a problem. Die. Fucker! Why won't you die? Fuck you! To your positions. Hello. Where did you get that tank? From the Nazis. Where are the Nazis? Except this asshole, they're all in hell. Hell? Were there others? Everyone else is dead. Bills. Big ones, please. Won't be so damn heavy to carry. carry.
