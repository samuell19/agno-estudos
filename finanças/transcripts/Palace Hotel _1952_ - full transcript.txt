Palace Hotel. No, it doesn't start until the day after tomorrow. Of course... I'll switch you to Reception. - Ah, Fredy! - Good morning, Ma'am. May I see the manager? My husband's in America. He's back at the end of January. Oh, I'd corresponded with him. I know, but no matter... ...we need you in the kitchen as a cook. I only became a cook to become a good waiter. After last season, I took service courses. Here's my diploma from Lausanne Hotel School. Here, take a look. I speak French and English well. Of course I'll look at it. But the thing is, we need cooks. We have sufficient service staff. Do you also speak Italian? Italian? Well... You see? Without Italian, you'd have problems. Go see Mr Leblanc in the kitchen. Thank you Madam. - Goulash! - Hello, Staub! Meat's not good for me. Are you still not better? I often find it difficult to keep standing. I always told you... you have to look after yourself. You do the whole floor alone. It's too much. I think 'upstairs' might get someone to help you. I know someone. Still keen to be a waiter? Go talk to the manager's wife. If you want something, address me... ...not a kitchen apprentice. I ask nothing of you... with your choleric ranting! I'm the calmest there is! But I won't have you annoying my staff! Keep it up, and I'll ban you from my kitchen altogether. You've been here 21 years, and I've been 34. Scram! In my goodness and stupidity I've imagined... ...that you were a cook. But you have no character. I won't allow you to speak to me like that, Mr Leblanc. Oh no? I'll show you what I can do... I can kick you out! With a bad reference, that you won't want to keep. It will say how 2 years ago... ...as I looked away a moment... ...you washed the truffles instead of brushing them! Mr Leblanc, you employed me. And I'm not good enough for you? A good cook doesn't look in the casserole. He knows, he feels to his fingertips when the meat is cooked. But when you only want one thing... To walk around the room, getting tips. This goulash is good. Where are they from? They're girls from Housekeeping. One of them's the new assistant for Emilie on the first floor. - The prettiest? - Yes, the one on the left. Look how he looks at us. - Yes, he's staring at us. - Who is he? He works in the kitchen. Having a good look?! Not nearly as good as you've been having! Mrs Muffler, hand us a cloth. I'll leave it to you to wipe it up. There's still some here. Signorina Speranza. - Where is she from? - From Roverbella. So, you are from Roverbella, bella. It seems that the most beautiful women come from Bologna. And the most handsome men do not come out of Italy. It's sweets for the sweet, with kind regards. The sweetest is you, “Tchachem”. Not Tchachem... Djachem... Dja... Dja... Have a little respect for the beauty of the Romansh language. I'd learn Italian well, with her. Non mi e simpatico... He doesn't like me. - Speranza, are you ready? - Si! - Come and help me. - Just a moment. The consul and his wife will be here any moment. I'll probably never see Fredy again. There are so many people at the hotel. The kitchen's busy by 11am. What a pity! Do the dusting while I arrange the flowers. Did you know he wants to learn Italian? Quick... out of here. Don't do that now, Mr Hunziker... Guests are arriving. All the more reason to set the heating. Hello, Madam Consul. - How are you, Emilie? - Good, thank you, Madam. Your room is ready. Has the consul arrived too? He's on his way up. Listen, Emily... Excuse me. When he comes, act like nothing's unusual. My husband isn't walking at all. Don't the baths do anything? He's given another year to live. He doesn't suspect a thing. Here's our dear Emilie! Greetings, Consul. - Someone was looking for you. - Who? I don't know his name. About the other heater. Ah, right. Thanks. - What's up? - The operator was after you. Hunziker. I was upstairs. Who wants me? Oh, him. Put me on to him. No, Miss Staub, better that I call him back. Hello? Stupid cow! Yes, this is he... I know, I was going to call you. But I haven't had time. The high season has started. I'd do anything for the union, you know that, as president. The money's there. I just have to do the accounts. By tomorrow? Impossible. Make less noise, I can't hear anything! Excuse me. Yes, I have all of it. What do you mean? Not a lot. About 1,200 francs. For the day after tomorrow? Yes, that should be fine. Fine. Goodbye. - Glass? - Il bicchiere. - The bottle? - La bottiglia. - The tray? - Il vassoio. Bene, multo bene. You didn't know it last time. Tablecloth? La tovaglia. To go get the tablecloth? Io vado... - No need to say "io". Vado a prendere una tovaglia. Did you forget the wine? Have you forgotten the wine? Lei ha ublietto... "Oublietto". How can you forget "forget"? Dementicare! Si si. Lei ha dimenticato il vino. Bene. So beg pardon. Why? Because you have forgotten the wine. Scuse, signorina. Vado prendere subito il vino. Scuse, signorina. Vado prendere subito il vino. Lei uno cameriere eccellente. Mille grazia! You learn quickly. Presto potrai leggere giornali e libri come in tedesco. Multo bene. I didn't understand it. Soon you will be able to read newspapers and books. It's not my thing. I learn a tongue with my ears. I need someone in front of me, who listens to me, who watches me. This a new hit song. The staff are already singing it. I can't understand the lyrics. They're difficult to understand. The meaning is... You have to keep your eyes open... occhi aperti, ...to take your chance when fortune shows up. La fortuna? Yes. Like the silhouette of a woman in a table. Suddenly she appears and if we don't take care of it, she disappears. After that? - Listen: “There is always a light to light up the night, a light to keep hope alive. Luck is never far away Luck is never far away. You're in luck? Yes, rather... - Me too. We are two lucky guys. How do you say in Italian? Siamo nati con la camicia. Ah, I'll write that down! We are... two lucky guys. Is this okay? Siamo nati con la camicia. Well... No. Speranza? What are you doing here? She's giving me Italian lessons. Here on the stairs? We've nowhere else. You said yourself, I have to learn Italian, to become a waiter. Are you on rest time? Yes, Ma'am. Alright. - What's this? - Our vocabulary book. Why not go to a language teacher? I want to learn the most important words quickly. - Lucky guys? - Con la camicia. Lucky guys...! He even tried to kiss me! - That's not so serious. - Not serious?! If Mum knew... What are you saying? If Mum knew, I'd get... Once, my sister who's older than me... ...let Hugo kiss her at the front door. My mum saw it. My God... my sister was in pain for 3 days. His face was in a state! But not because of the kiss. Hugo is my brother-in-law now. I guarantee Fredy's carrying-on won't go any further. I'll give him a piece of my mind. Emilie, someone wants to see you. Me? Where are you coming from in the middle of the week? From Zernez. Has something happened, Walter? Come here. Tell me what happened. I don't want to go back to Zernez. It looks like he's been beaten, poor boy. Don't you have a handkerchief? You have a loving mother. Tell her what happened to you. It's not my fault. I'd tied the satchel to the sled. What satchel? The old brown leather one. Mr Caprez asked me to always take it when visiting clients. I understand... He's lost it. I went back the whole way, but it snowed this morning. The satchel had disappeared - Was there money in it? - Yes. How much? Mr Caprez has written you a letter. He demands to be reimbursed. - Where's this letter? - It's in the mail. They didn't send me here. I came myself. Did you run away? I'm not going back. I'm afraid of Mr. Caprez! And even more of his brother! Don't send me back or I'll run away again I want to know how much money it was. 1,846 francs. Good God! The Caprez's seem to know the ropes. Is your son often distracted or day-dreaming? I don't know. Is he disorganised? I don't know. Emilie, surely you know your own son? No, Sir. He's always been in boarding school, as I was working. Mine were seasonal jobs. You earn more. So I also work in the school holidays. You won't believe it, but we hardly know each other. And you've endured that, Emilie? You can get used to a lot of things. At least if I don't have to pay at all at once! We're not talking about payment yet. Let it come down to a court action. The court will decide for you... ...a widow, bringing up a child. But if it comes to a lawsuit... ...I can't afford to pay. You couldn't just talk to these people? If you want that... Of course. I shouldn't do this... I shouldn't have said anything. My husband could see that something was up. I don't want to bother you. Relax! It's alright. I'll speak to those gentlemen and I'll get back to you. I want to call Zernez... Caprez wine merchants. Is anyone in 133? Not at the moment... They're at dinner. Yes. - Do my bed! - Certainly, Dr Suvalà. Emilie, the manager is looking for you. The lady director? - Yes. Then clean up here! Yes? Go to Madam's office. Take your boy with you. I don't know. I found Emilie, Madam. Thanks. The pain will go away, I know it will. No... We need a replacement anyway. But who? How about Fredy? The cook? Do you think he's suitable for this? You could try him. Alright, then he should start right away. Mr Leblanc, please! It's just a try-out. If Fredy doesn't prove himself, say so! I don't want to lose a good chef for a bad waiter. My husband... Mr Leblanc? I need Fredy up here. What? Yes, it has to go. I'll come down. You can go, Mr Staub... And take care of yourself. Thank you Madam. Madam... Speranza already told me that your son is here. I don't like it to be so. I don't want to burden you with my private life. Hello, Walter... Don't look so unhappy! Be glad he's here. He doesn't learn anything from Caprez anyway. They only use him as an errand boy. Yes, but what should I do now? There's sure to be a solution. In summer he was happy. Now he's very shy. He can work here. Here? Yes, with our cellar-master. He could live on the premises? If that's all right with you. Walter, you can stay with me! - I don't know how... - Don't worry! I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. Say thank you, Walter! Fanny can fix a bed for him in the attic. Now he comes with me to the cellar. Bye bye! Good evening, madame. Finally! Your husband will be delighted that you are here. I shan't disturb you now. I'll be back. I'm not stupid. You want to tell me you're innocent of this assassination attempt against me? - I certainly am. - Can I count on you? - I always do my duty. - Good. Silence! Quiet! I have something important to say to you. A steak Pojarski, with 2 duchess potatoes! - Yes! - 2 spinach leaves. If these attacks against the kitchen, don't stop... If any of my people are taken away away by force... I Jerome Leblanc, Head Chef... ...will shut down this kitchen myself. The guests will sit, facing empty plates. Management should be blamed... ...for this tyrannical nonsense! Our guests should stay at the Hotel Kulm or eat at the Belvedere... ...or the alcohol-free Steinbock restaurant. Don't be afraid of this man. Madam, I refuse all responsibility. For what you say? No, for what's happening here. I'm missing two cooks and an assistant. Now you want me to allow... ...our best sauce, roast, grill, and dessert cook, be taken away? Mr Leblanc, my husband is in America. I must be very careful in my instructions... ...because I'm only a woman. I seem to have relied too much upon your gallantry. Madam, you are in charge. That's not the point... I want to be understood. Carry on, please! You'll get the people you need, but Fredy has to go upstairs. Didn't you hear what Madam said? Back to work! The cellar-master is very nice. But he grew up in Germany, but he tries to speak Swiss-German. - Yes, thank you. - For what? My mother said I should say thank you. - Thanks. - That's enough! Yes, Madam! I'm sure you can use some help Mr Loosli. - An assistant? - This is Walter, Emilie's son. Of course. We always have work. He'd already been apprenticed for half a year. Take care of him. That's fine, Madam. Well, let's show you the ropes. - Can you label? - Sure. Come on, show us what you can do. - Do you know what a barrique is? - No, Mr. Loosli. It's a barrel of burgundy with 225 liters content. What do you do with a wine that got oily? I don't know that either. You have to beat such a wine. Best against an old car tire. You wouldn't learn that from a teacher. Where did you get that? I invented it to make all the labels the same height. You and I will get along. Come and eat now! - You start tomorrow at 7 o'clock. - Thank you, good night. - Cheerio. - What? Ciao. I've managed to do the best I can... The Caprez brothers scaled back their demands. If they get the money right away, they'll settle for 1,000 francs. You're lucky that you've contacted my husband. Aren't you satisfied? Yes, I'm very grateful to you. Here's the letter. Is there anything else? I've no clue what to do. I don't have 1,000 francs. You should have told me that right away. Don't you have any savings? - An advance? - That's no good... I still have debts from the previous season. We don't earn badly... ...when you just have to take care of yourself. But I always had to pay for my boy. Consul, I have no one in the world. I ask you... I have never done this before. Please, Consul... both of you... Please help me! How long have we actually known each other? You've been coming to the Palace since 1943. You were in England only in the summer of 1947. Is there 1,000 francs in the portfolio? Yes. Please give her the money. I'll do everything to return it as soon as possible. Let's not talk about the future! You should always do what is needed at the moment. Good evening, Sir, Madam... The menu. If you'd prefer to eat a la carte... Thanks, I'll call then. What's the matter? I hope he didn't see the money. What would it matter? For God's sake... If the manager finds out that I took money from a guest... ...I'd lose my job. Surely not!? Yes it's like that here! Do you remember Alice? She was fired because she sold handicrafts to a lady. Walter can work here now. Madam allowed it. That means a lot to me. He's near me... I can see him every day. We leave tomorrow morning. You needn't be concerned. Thanks. - Fredy? - Yes? Mr Staub said you're a waiter now. Is that true? Just a moment. You look beautiful! Be careful! I'd have liked to have it pressed, but it has to do for tonight. Do you know who that was? I tell you, it was Happiness Didn't you see? It even threw back a look And the look, the look was for you It was clear to see But you just stay here Planted Crying won't get you anywhere Be smarter next time Happiness can sometimes run away It happens You'll find it again This also happens There is always a light, that lights up the night One light, that keeps hope awake Happiness is not out of this world Happiness is not out of this world - I have to go. - Just a moment. I have to go to my room. Emilie must be asleep. - We're very lucky. - Yes. No no. - Emilie, can't you sleep? - No. - Am I disturbing you? - No, not at all. I've been teaching Fredy Italian. It was his first time on the floor. Yes, yes, there is a lot to talk about. He's the handsomest man in the hotel. Did you see him? Yes. In tails. For me, he's the most beautiful thing in the hotel. You've a great time ahead of you. When I met my Karl, we stood in front of the door for hours. It was a wonderful time... ...despite everything that came afterwards. He was a telephone linesman. He wasn't as tall as your Fredy, but very cute. I can still see his brown hat. He tilted it so crazily. We lived in the country then, near Graz. We didn't have any iron telephone poles then... ...only pine ones. His work clothes were sometimes very gummy. It was hard to wash out. But it had a heavenly smell. Even when they brought him home dead, they smelled of resin. Holy Virgin Mary! I hope that doesn't happen to Fredy! He can hardly fall off a telephone pole. I believed I could never be happier. Now I am. I'm with my Walter, under one roof again... ...for the first time in 12 years. Where are my snow goggles? It's all too tidy... I can't find anything. Here, Doctor. And the money? Money? I didn't see any. I left some money here. Right there. Speranza! - Yes? - The doctor's looking for some money. It's here. What...? I put it here. Maybe you put it in here. Non capisco. I don't know where it is now. You're going out, Dr Suvala? I have to go to the doctor quickly. Do you know where Madam is? She was just on the 2nd floor. Just a moment, Dad. Muhlheim an der Ruhr? You're connected, Sir. Madam, you're wanted in room 132! - When will you be back? - In half an hour at the latest. - Money was stolen on the 1st floor. - With us? Where? Where was money stolen? From Dr Suvala. His claim, or is it a fact? - He claims so. - Then it's doubtful. I'm quite serious. I remember him when his name was... I know the name... just can't remember. The second time he came with a South American passport. And now again with something else. Now he claims his name is Suvala, with an accent on the back A. I'd like to know where he got it from. He's no more a doctor than I am. Yes, Madam. Mr Staub, to Madam in room 132. Oh! It's 1 o'clock. And send me the messenger boy. Who else have you seen? Hunziker. But he was in 133. And Hunziker. Miss Luthi, they should come quickly. Why are you bothering? Why don't you call the police? I don't want that. But I want my money back. We are not liable for the loss. You could have had the money put in the safe. But I don't want trouble. If your money doesn't show up, we'll refund you the amount. Thank you. I hope in your interest... ...the honest finder is content with the 300 dollars. I guess you don't need me anymore. Why didn't you tell Dr Suvala that you put the money away? Yes? - You wanted to speak to me? - Yes. Who served in this room yesterday? - I did. - No one else? - No one. - And Fredy? - Fredy doesn't steal. - I didn't ask you. This room is missing 300 dollars. And it is unfortunately assumed that it was stolen. I brought the mail this morning. The doctor was in the room. I don't understand. Are we the only suspects? It could also have been stolen by a guest. Were you up here yesterday too? Yes, I've been up here. But that was for 133. Forgive me... if we're suspected, you could search our stuff. Or ask whether dollars were exchanged. And when they haven't been changed yet? Then they can still be changed. The suggestion is correct. - You should go to all banks... - Emilie! Have the wastebaskets been searched? - No, but the bags are still outside. - Then look and let me know. I only need Mr Staub for now. How could you? Now, if someone took the money, they'll be careful not to change it! But I'll ask at the banks, anyway. Give me accounting! Did you shovel the snow in front of the door? Right away. - There's a man outside, asking for you. - For me? Ah, Chief! You expected me yesterday, I know. - I can't wait any longer. - Of course. Something stupid happened to me. I had the money A friend lent it to me. But now he needs it himself. Now I'm stuck. Where's the union money? About 100 francs are still there. You know what has to be paid. Say no more... Understood. I'll take the case to the board. Impossible! That's out of the question. You've a good job, no family, and you embezzle our money, damn it! I've been a member for almost 25 years and did a lot of volunteer work. - Can you get the money together? - Sure, I have other friends. - The matter will be settled this year! - Count on it! I'll bring it all on New Year's Day after church. Be sure it's no later, Hunziker. I hate playing the cop... ...fooling with things belonging to the staff. There's nothing. You don't need to look there. That's Emilie's. Nothing will be here either. Strange... Did Emilie have to pay Caprez anything? They write that they'll refrain from further claims if 1,000 francs are paid. Here's a receipt for 1,000 francs. Deposited this morning at 7.30. There are still Fr. 27.60 on the book, since September. I really want to know where Emilie got 1,000 francs from. I could ask her. I'll do it. I'd suspected Speranza. My apologies, but nothing has been proven for Emilie either. But please! We're missing 300 dollars. 1,000 Fr. were paid in here by someone who has no money... ...and was in and out of 132. So Emilie would be there very early... ran to a bank manager... ...as the exchange office wasn't open, and said... "Dear Sir, change these 300 dollars. It's urgent." No, it can't be a travelers check. Today or in the next few days. I'd be grateful if you'd call right away. Thanks. Did you find anything? Not as yet, Madam. But I still have to inquire at other agencies. I don't expect anything. Money may have been changed by a guest. Mr Staub, I'd like to have you with me, when I talk to Emilie. We found nothing in the rubbish, Madam. I have to ask you something personal. Speranza is definitely innocent. I was in your room earlier. I had to investigate. Of course. It's just that... You have an amount of 1,000 francs transferred to Zernez this morning. - Yes I had to... - For Walter, I know. That's fine and it's your private concern. This 1,000 francs... Please understand that no one would think... I know nothing about the 300 dollars. Where did you get the 1,000 francs? You have no savings. Where did you get the money? I can't tell you. Emilie... Shall I go out to let you talk to Madam in private? If you don't tell me, unfortunately I'm forced to... I swear that I didn't take the 300 dollars. Go now. I'll let you know. I'm determined... She's packing her bags today! The boy can stay because of me. Do you still believe that Emilie is innocent? I don't know, Madam. If she'd taken the money, she'd have defended herself better... ...and especially not left the payment slip lying around. The calculating machine in accounting works perfectly. You can rely on them. But it can give a wrong result, if only one figure was miss-typed. Alright Staub. Let's not talk about it anymore! Very well, Madam. Miss Emilie Wendler Following our investigations of recent events, we are obliged to dismiss you... Emilie, please. Hello Emilie. I've thought about it. I can't leave you on the floor now. But I've not yet decided anything definitively. You can work in the kitchen as a preparer until then. Good, then get in touch with Mr Leblanc. Thank you, Madam. - What did she say? - I can stay. Good! What are you doing? You have to do the rooms by yourself. I'll be in the kitchen starting today. In the kitchen? I'm fine with that. Go now or you won't finish! In 134 they have a 2nd lounge chair requested for the balcony. Don't forget the blankets! At Madame Perrot's every day at 9am you have to... ...fetch the dog without waking her, for the messenger boy to take out. - And 129 needs hangers. - Emilie! If you don't know something, ask me! I have to get corks for the kirsch for Mr Loosli. It has to be the best. I can choose them. That's right. Take care! - A steak tartare! - Mr Leblanc. I was told to get in touch with you as a preparer. I could've done with you 2 hours ago. Go to the potatoes! Chicken Curry! - How should I cut them? - What, cut? That's men's work. You have to peel! Five mushroom slices. 3 Wienerschnitzel! Asparagus with hollandaise! - Where's the scrambled eggs for 127? - Coming in two minutes. - I don't have time now. - Me neither. - Yes? What? - Kiss Me! Are you crazy? You can hear every word downstairs. I don't care. I haven't seen you for 2 days. I have my hands full. Fredy! I have to clean it. You can't serve it like that. Too late. Maxim! Come in! Good morning Madam. Are you new? My colleague Staub has to rest. I'm helping out. Where would you like your breakfast? There by the window. - Please open the blinds! - Yes, Madam. Maxim, you're impossible today. You must excuse him. Maxim is shy. Every new face upsets him. But he is corruptible. Give him a piece of sugar! With your permission. - When were you born? - Sorry? - When were you born? - August 2nd. Then you're a Leo. I'm sorry, what? Use your success tenderly and energetically. Unexpected perspectives open up. Sorry, but I don't believe in horoscopes. They're never true for me. That depends on the newspaper. It's always true for me. I'm a cancer Listen... This week you must have a change in your job. It also says for you... Money: profit, Letters: nothing special, Love: luck Pleasure: good prospects.» - You're lucky! - Perhaps. I've actually been lucky lately. I can see that. How, Madam? On your jacket. This is... raspberry jam. Sorry. Anything else Madam would like? No thank you. I have to work twice as much now. No one's come for Emilie yet. Everyone’s tripping over each other, there's so much staff. Miss Muffler, you work and we work. But of course it's harder for you. You also have to talk all day. So we don't steal. - Does the boy know what happened? - I don't believe so. We say the person concerned would have flown. - On the other hand... - Make your point! That's enough! Walter, get me a bottle of apple juice! Don't you have tact, no brains? Nobody has said anything in front of the boy... ...except you with your pointed tongue. One blames an honest woman and a thief is protected! Quiet now! Your boy brings me great joy. Walter is also very happy to be with you. He is precise and hardworking. And if he stays temperate later, he'll make a good cellar-master. That's why I became a pastry chef. Paul said to the Corinthians... "If you're not thirsty, you're not a Bundner." Emilie, has that 300 dollars appeared? Now I'll blow a gasket. Unfortunately not yet as far as I know. Money was stolen on the first floor. But let me say in front of you and everyone... I didn't take it. There is a woman, who won't shut up A woman, that spoils our food The Evil Mouths are not from this world Madame Perrot asked for you. I told her you're free. I'll go right up. Fredy, I'm warning you. About what? I could have done it on day one, to talk to you about it. Do you know what room 127 is? - A corner room. - Yes, that too. But we call it the Registry Office, if that tells you something. No. I blame myself, that I gave you that room. Room 127, which Madame Perrot now has... ...has been the doom of two of your predecessors. First it was about Robert. That was in 1924. He could have had a career, if it hadn't happened to him. What happened? 1946, the first season after the war, Gaston got it. Also a real talent. A lady from room 127... ...an English aristocrat, married him mid-season. She took him to her castle in Warwick. And Robi, his predecessor, ...is playing today, in St Gallic, the sad role of a manufacturer. I guess I don't have to tell you more. Both got married? Hence the name Registry Office for 127. Probably one was uglier than the other. think! The one from St Gallic was a lady from head to toe. Maybe a little plump. But Robi liked that. He liked them solid. And then this English lady. It could even have been dangerous for me. Whenever she passed me, I got a lump in my throat. In short, my predecessors found their happiness. Happiness? Gaston has been dead for two years. His lady got the hots shortly after the wedding... ...for a lord, and they went to India... off to the trees. Because he didn't want to go back to the hotel business... ...he started, with no knowledge of industry, to speculate. And of course that was the beginning of the end. - And Robert? - Oh, poor Robert! He has nothing to say at all. Neither in the factory nor at home. He just sits around all day. And when he wanted to start beekeeping... ...his wife allowed him not even that. You don't have to worry about me! And Madame Perrot is married. This year, for the first time, Mr Perrot didn't come. That speaks volumes. But Staub... Such a spoiled woman and I... She grabs you when she feels like it. I would also have a say in that. Madame asked for me? You're free this afternoon, aren't you? Yes, Madame. Can I get you something? I'm going to the skating rink. Come with me! You are very kind, madam. I don't know... If you're seen with a waiter... Don't be so Swiss! Ice skating is not my forte. Mine neither. So that's great. Come with me! I'll be done in a minute. I'm sorry, but I'm not allowed to be seen in the hotel with a guest. Take Maxim, and wait for me at the rink! You may be seen with my dog. Yes, of course. Come on, Maxim, we're going out. We're going for a nice walk. - Is Fredy free yet? - Yes, he's gone out. He's to have Italian lessons. When is he coming back? He changed his clothes and is gone. I think to buy shoes. - But he can't be far yet. - Thanks. You seem to be very popular. You're going to have a career. Madam has too high an opinion of me. How come? Look at the men upstairs in the dining room. You'd beat anyone. I try to educate myself. I read a lot and am learning Italian. - Yes? Who with? - With a... teacher. Good, but not top class. I must confess, I've only recently become a waiter. I was in the kitchen before. It was not easy, to make the jump. You will take it even further. Are you married? Unfortunately, I've had sad experiences in this area. Two of my colleagues have made so-called good matches... ...and became miserable. Their wives always left them due to the social divide. - I would never sell myself. - That's a stupid word. A loving woman overcomes everything. I'm not taking up too much of your time? My shift doesn't start until 5 o'clock. Have you seen the figure skater? Do you want to take a look? - Thank you, doctor. - My pleasure. - That control! - Yes. She's been here about 6 times. Your... So? I said you went shoe-shopping, just for you to say the same. It was a lovely afternoon. I completely forgot... Something important to tell you. If a single lady, let's assume from the 127... ...ordered a bottle of champagne, doesn't mean anything. But she explicitly asks for 2 glasses with it, be careful. Why? Otherwise... "Got him, said the wife." Don't forget it! Office. Why? Fine, I'll be right there. Where have you been? I wanted to go out. I wanted to buy shoes. Skating shoes! What do you mean? What? You louse! What are you on about! It's over, over and done with! What did you think? That you could treat me like this?! All the better. 700 francs in notes were in it. My book proves it. Only this 17.65 was left behind. - When did you find out? - Just before the call. I wanted to get change for Joachim's 50 francs. Gentian. I have to eat sweets all day... - Was the drawer locked? - Naturally. I always close it. - The lock is scratched. - There was a break-in here. - What? - 700 francs are missing. I thought I should notify you. It's clear... a criminal's among us. - Was Emilie here? - No. That was men's work. - We'll catch the guy! In Biarritz... - No stories! There was also theft over there. Our pastry chef caught the thief... ...with a very simple method. I must get the recipe. Would you mind if I convene a staff meeting? - A staff meeting? - Yes. Now it's everyone's business. And everyone has to help solve it. - Yes but when? - Tonight. A guest can commit theft in-house, as can an outsider. But as for the theft in the basement, I think... ...it has to be someone familiar with the building. Meaning, each of us is a suspect. I don't agree that we can all be thrown into the same pot. I can't get into the rooms. Neither do my girls. And certainly not the wine-cellar. We drink tea. There's nothing to laugh about. It's a serious situation. Dear comrades, some things are badly organized. We face the hardest day of the year... New Year's Eve. We know what it takes for tomorrow... no, today, it's already 1 o'clock... ...that the reputation of the hotel does not suffer. - Why... - Correct! We'll soon be working 2-days straight, not sitting around here. Enough of this! I speak on behalf of my colleagues from the dining room. Our request... Management should have the police handle it. Bravo! Decide by vote! I want to make it as short as possible. You should call the police! I'm against it. We don't even know who the thief is... ...nor what made him a thief. If it actually happens that it's about a colleague... ...it's our duty to give him a chance. If the culprit owns up in the old year... ...I suggest to Mr. Gloor... ...that we see how we can help him. And if nothing comes of it? Then we hand it over to the police, after the new-year holiday. Does anyone want to comment? Yes me. I support the Staub motion. Though it's ridiculous to assume that such a scoundrel would own up. But I want to warn that some can't help being suspected. For example, my job takes me to all rooms. - Stop! Nobody's suggesting you! - Quiet! I know what I'm talking about. I ask the cellar-master whether the cellar door had been forced open. - No. - Who found that out? Myself, Staub and Joachim. Madam can attest to that. And tell me... Is this door always locked? With the exception of brief moments, yes. So nobody comes into the cellar? Of course people come. The odd person drinks a glass they pay for. But I'm always there. Nobody was down today. That's enough for me. So then the thief, in one short moment in the basement... ...broke into the cash register, stole the money, and disappeared? He doesn't need to steal... He can appear in variety shows. So if the thief is not a variety artist... ...and if nobody let him into the basement... - ...common sense tells you... - Exactly! You think it was someone who works in the cellar? Why doesn't Mr Hunziker come out and say... ...that he thinks my boy is the thief? - What's the matter? - Are you okay? Go out! Have cold water run over the back of your neck! I don't want to suspect anyone, including the boy. But I would like to ask one thing... When did the boy come into the hotel? On December 21st. And when have the 200 or 300 dollars disappeared? On December 21st. Emilie... Can you imagine your Walter capable of doing something wrong? I don't believe so. But I will ask him. We still have a decision to make, if nobody wants to say anything else. Apparently not... so we can vote. One proposal is... ...hand the matter over to the police, immediately. If you are in favour, raise your hand! The second proposal is to call the police only... ...if the efforts of the staff have been unsuccessful. Who votes for the second motion? The majority! Then we'll break up. I thank you all. Good night! Good night! - Walter! - Yes? How's your nosebleed? It's almost gone. - Does it happen often? - No. Why did it happen now? I don't know. I didn't feel anything. Suddenly it was there. I hope you're honest, Walter. Do you have something to do with Mr Loosli's 700 francs? No. Definitely not. Does Mr Loosli believe that? Did you take the money? Why do you ask, if you don't believe me?! There's another way to get out of it. I take everything on myself. But don't lie to me now! - Do you have the money? - No. Let me go! You don't believe me. And neither does Mr Loosli. Everyone downstairs looked at me like a thief. Maybe they're right. How do I know that you're not like your father? He lied to me too, with the most honest face. You have the same eyes as him. I won't tolerate a second time. Walter! Open up! Open up immediately! - What is it? - Walter! - Walter! - Emilie, is Walter not well? Open the door immediately! Did he do it? He'll harm himself... Why is nobody helping me? Open the door now or I'll break it down. Walter! How can you scare me like that? - You don't believe me. - I believe you. I believe you totally. I love you. Because of you, I begged for 1000 francs from guests. No one in the hotel may know that I did that. Otherwise I will be fired. Then we're not together again. That must never be the case again. You're all I have in the world. I want you to stay with me. Always. That's why I'm so scared. Madam, the light is still on in the office. I have an arrival from New Orleans. - The manager? - Yes. So he's soon back? - You'd be happy. - Please, Madam! I wouldn't be surprised. Can you understand, I always had the feeling... ...I had the business well in hand. When my husband was obliged to make his trip to America... ...and gave me the management, I was pleased, proud of it. I didn't make it easy for myself. We all know that. I walk around the hotel a few times a day... Check every order every piece of laundry, every menu. I'm there for every arrival, play bridge with the guests... ...when I'd rather be in bed. I do what I can. And yet today I asked myself if I was in the right place. But, Madam! Our hotel is outdated. They build very differently today. But our guests keep coming back every year. They feel comfortable with us. We also owe it to the staff. They do more than their duty. It's also the duty of management to never forget.. ...that the staff consists of people with worries, fears and weaknesses. I don't want to make myself appear worse than I am... ...but sometimes I feel down, and have to ask myself... ...if I can do my job. - You mean the Emilie thing? - Yes. I thought about putting her back in her job. But that's not possible. I can't expect her to do that. I've taken her off it, as a thief, with no evidence. And now I owe her the proof that she is not. That she was wronged. That's my husband. Give him my regards! And from all of us, of course. We can comfortably set up 3 more tables. Yes, Madam. For distributing the paper hats, I'd like to be there at 11.30 sharp. 15 minutes later the champagne has to be on on the tables. For anything else, I rely on you. Yes, Madam. A bottle of champagne? Certainly, Madam. Is it be a special brand? Lanson? Irroy? Brut. Certainly, Madam. Get another hour of sleep! I can do it alone until 5 pm. I don't need sleep... I'm young And swinging, eh? This is my first New Year's Eve as a waiter. - Who gets it? - Room 127. - Now in the afternoon? - Why not? I drink champagne preferably for breakfast. You have to enjoy champagne, not guzzle it. Office. Yes, I'll bring it up immediately. I'm sorry, what? Certainly, Madam. - Two glasses? - Two glasses. Madam wishes it so. Fredy... Remember what I told you! Fredy... Think of your two predecessors! Don't worry about me! Do you know who that was? Listen, it was happiness And the look, the look was for me Just come in! - The champagne. - I thought you were off duty today. Yes, until now. My time starts shortly. - Till then you're off duty with me? - Yes, Madam. May I open the bottle? If I may take your time. Certainly, madam. Please fill both glasses! As you wish, Madam. Here he is, sweetheart. He's excellent. - Please, the glass for my husband. - Thanks. - Thanks. You can go. - Certainly. What is it? Look out! Your door must remain open from now on. So that something is stolen again? This money is provided by the management. You put it in your drawer like this so anyone can get at it. Caution! Hey, give me a double cognac, right away! Go on in... I'll be right with you. I get it... You wrote down the numbers. Idiot, now you're getting black mitts. - I see nothing. - Just wait. Silver nitrate. We prepared the money. 200 are with me, 200 with Leblanc. In total, we have over 1,000 francs laid out as bait. Great! This is going to be exciting! - But... - Of course. Alright. As far as I'm concerned, the battle can get under way. My bombs are ready. - Do you want something? - Are you worried? I've just been very stupid. Then you won't get any cognac from me, but the 521 B. - This is a drop for the soul. - Me too! - You don't want anything? - Just alcohol. On New Year's Eve you should always lay a firm foundation. - And you drink with me. - No. No alcohol during the day. I stick to that rule, even today. You did something stupid? I was an absolute idiot. - I imagined... - What? I don't want to talk about it. That sounds like a difficult case to me. But crying won't get you anywhere now. - Be smarter next time! - Yeah. Happiness may sometimes disappear It happens - That's the way it is. - You'll find it again That also happens. Hopefully. I could kick myself. Cheers, Fredy. Cheers, boyo... Enjoy yourselves. You let us drink alone? For me, wine is a delight to the tongue, not the throat. But Fredy, how can you guzzle such a gift of God like that? Here, look! Johannisberg Castle, Cabinet, Prince of Metternich domain. - The wine has gone sulfurous. - Are you crazy? It burns the stomach. The wine is divine! I have this feeling after drinking it... How can I describe it... A pleasant feeling. One may need 2 glasses. Yes... I've also got a strange feeling. Bruno, get that! The more you drink of the wine the better it tastes. - Here's to Speranza! - Long may she live! Vive l'amour! Walter, another bottle of 521 B! Right? Gradually we come to the right taste. Fredy, get upstairs now! Something's happened. Thank God! The money is still there. Actually, black as a winter night. Don't bother! It won't come off for 24 hours. Thank you my boy! Ah, already opened! What's up? Mr Staub is in a bad way. He has to go to Samedan Hospital. - My father had a hemorrhage. - Who's taking him? The nurse is going with me. Alright, Mister Staub. We can get going. Is it really necessary? It's best for you. You'll get the right care. What must you think of me, Fredy... That I'm skipping work, today of all days! Hurry up! I don't want any guests to see me. Are you coming to visit me? Of course, Dad. Tomorrow. 30 years at the Palace! But I've never left it like this. Now I have New Year's Eve free for the first time. I can't even dance with that stupid leg. Farewell, Fredy, All the best! - Here's to you, Joachim! - And to you, Loosli! I always had to have a Johannisberger to serve my captain... ...when I was still at sea. A bottle on departure a bottle on arrival. And always a bottle when a storm had passed. We had a lot of storms. Our glorious, beautiful ship... ...lurched and pounded harder and harder. Harder and harder. Then serve! It was awful. Don't think I'm drunk. You don't need to pretend. I hear and see everything. Even if I don't notice anything. Yes, I take you seriously. You ARE drunk! I thank you. Here's to you, Joachim. Here's to you, Loosli. I have to go. - That's alright, isn't it? - Do you want to insult me? You're my guest! Stay with me a little longer! I have to look if the money is still there, everywhere. I'll be right back. I am waiting here for you! Boys, come here! Come here! You shouldn't stay dry today, either. And our boy Walter gets a fresh fruit juice. How terrible! - Mr Loosli, it... - No talking back! I have spoken. Come here! Someone complained to management that we're not clean. Show your hands! Wipe the flour off! I thought so, we are clean. - Has anyone else been here? - I didn't see anyone. We had coffee earlier, in the dining room. Someone could have come in then. But everything's clean here. Here's to Bacchus! Long live Bacchus Bacchus was a good man Not so loud, Mr Loosli! You can hear us upstairs! - I'll order you coffee. - Joachim, finally! My 200 francs are gone. I'm out of my mind! Which one of you has black f... Are you crazy? No one should know about it. None of your people left the cellar. Including Walter. We wrongly suspected him. - Walter, my Walter! - You're drunk. Come to my heart! Mr Loosli is not doing well. Go to the sickroom with him! Ask the nurse to give him something. Walter, my... Walter... Huldas-Puldas- and his 3 sons... The big, the medium and the very tiny! Watch the step, Mr Loosli! This is too much! And his three sons. SOS! Get aboard, my boy! Close the bulkheads! The ship's never pitched like this before. Stay on your feet, Loosli, just don't step off! It's still wobbling. A leak! Plug it! Bring rags! Rags! Rags to plug the leak! The mast is breaking! This old crate is sinking! Farewell, friends and family. My Moose. Else Bumke, star of the Bamboo Bar. Madam manager, report wind force 521 B. Captain Johannisberger... overboard! We're upright! Land! We're saved! There's a New Year's present for you. - That's too much, Doctor. - No, just take it! - Thanks very much. - Please pick up the cards. - Don't you think they're pretty? - No, disgusting! Terrible. I don't get a kiss for my 20 francs? Please. Leave me alone! How dare you! Fredy! Fredy! - What do you think you're doing? - Just go, Speranza. - Get out of my room, you lout! - Don't say that again! One more step and you'll have no more teeth. - My apologies. - Private. Thanks. Have you found Mr Loosli? Keep looking, it's urgent! Mr Loosli! Mr Loosli! Wake up! Mr Loosli, the cellar boys can't manage without you. This is good... Hospital room? - What am I doing here? - You were unwell, Mr Loosli. I wasn't well? Take this please. Isn't it harmful? On the contrary. For headaches, neuralgia, belching, and intemperate drinking. I don't usually suffer from neuralgia. What's the time? 8.30 8.30?! I have to hurry. 3 cold dinners for the floor! 3 cold cream soups. 3 vegetable platters with butter. Mrs Muffler, come wipe this away! First: Prawns in curry sauce. After that: truffled chicken. 1 steak St Nicolas. 11 soups of the day. 11! I called you. My 200 francs are gone. Now at least you needn't look far. Just see to your work! You were asked for twice in the cellar. I don't have time now... You play detective! But don't disturb the operation! Do you think that Emilie...? - No. But I'll make sure. - Good. 3 orange salads. 2 cold salmon, two tartare. 2 fillets of veal Lucullus. Noodles with butter. 2 Crepes Suzette. Yes! – Pastry chef, desserts 6 and 2! Yes! – Three times caviar a discretion. Seven place settings. Two place settings! - Emilie? I wish you the best for the new year! All the best to you in particular. - All the best to you too. - You have black fingers! - Does that surprise you? - It can be washed off. - All the best! - Happy New Year! All the best! Three 543, one 119, one 601. Four 536. Mop up here! Otherwise someone will slip. Money was stolen from the chef. Now they're guessing who did it. Emilie is sitting next door in the preparation section. Mrs Muffler claims that my mother steals. I haven't. Yes, stand by your words, you shameless woman. Where the boy is, money gone. Where his mother is, money gone. - My mother doesn't steal! - Let go of me, you thief! Let go of the boy! - It wasn't my mother. Mrs Muffler... - Forget Mrs Muffler! You must understand, Walter... We have a thief in the hotel. If your mother had said how she got the 1,000 francs... ...you would have fired her. - Nonsense! For what reason? Tell me, Walter... did your mother get the money from a guest? I didn't say anything. So she got it from a guest. I did not say that. Be quiet, my boy! Madam, it's 11.30 Thank you, I'm coming. Listen, Walter. A hotel is a business unlike any other. We are all just there for the guests. You often have to forbid a lot of things that are allowed outside. It's impossible, quite impossible... ...that someone from the staff borrows money from a guest. Please don't fire my mother! Please! After everything that's happened, I'll no longer send her away. I promise you that, Walter. Go now! Palace Hotel, Mr Cadbury, Call from Chicago. Who is speaking? You're connected. Palace Hotel. I'm sorry, what? I'll give you Miss Staub. Samedan district hospital. Yes? Yes Sister? I can't leave when it's busy. It's impossible. Maybe after 1 o'clock. One moment please. Palace Hotel. Bad Gastein? I'm connecting. Excuse me Sister. Is it dangerous? Yes I understand. Yes. I'll come as soon as possible. Thank you sister. Palace Hotel. Palace Hotel. Paris... go ahead. - I'll connect you. - The line is overloaded. - No, it may take a few hours. – Your call to Brussels. Is the talk with Rome over? Thanks. Signorina, finally. Signorina, done. Complete. Palace Hotel. - Palace. Three 520. Two 518. One 180 I've lost all hope. The guy is smarter than us. I was after him like a hunting dog. No one has black mitts. One 420! Black mitts? There was... Somebody had black hands. - Who? - Who was it? - Now or this afternoon? - How should I know? This afternoon when I was in such a state. The boy was there. Did he see anything? I was alone. We'll go the same way to the sickroom! Then you remember. I can't leave. You have to, I won't have any more time afterwards! Bruno, stand in for me for a few minutes! Two 581! Seven 601, one 543. Wait a moment! It could have been here. There was someone here... Like this. No, that was me. Bathroom sink? Maybe in the sickroom? Come! was it here - I don't know. Joachim, don't be angry with me! I don't know anything anymore. I collapsed on this bed. Out to it. - And then? - After that, a blank Still drunk? The money, you scoundrel! Look at your hands! So you painted it with something filthy! Where's the money? Fine colleagues YOU are! I was just going to go to Gloor and sort things out. You know very well that the accountant left at 7pm. - Give it to me! - Let me go! If I hadn't see Gloor, I'd have seen Madam. He stole the dollars too. Miss Luthi, Madam please. It's urgent. Let me go! The moneys there, every cent. I haven't hurt anyone. You made the boy out to be a thief! And that poor woman! You rascal! You piece of shit! You can't do this! Open the door! Emilie, it's all been cleared up. Please go back to your old post. Thank you, Madam. Tomorrow morning. No, I'd like for you to go up now. All the best, Emilie. Happy New Year. Buon anno!
