Mom, I'm coming. Humans must've done this. How do we fight fire? Riki, run! Which way, which way? Run, Riki! Faster, Riki! Get up, Riki. Look in the direction of your horn and run as fast as you can. I hope he makes it. I won't leave you. Mom, Mom! Come closer, my friends, deep into the heart of Indonesia. Let me tell you the story of a fearsome jungle warrior, Riki the Rhino, a hero across the land... Thank you, Riki. You're the best. ...A friend to all the animals. My pleasure. His strength and generosity knows no bounds. Hey there. Don't be scared. From the smallest creature to the largest, he'll keep you safe, day or night. His famed rhinoceros horn gives him his strength and power. Please help my baby. Some would say his legend surpasses the king of our jungle, the mighty Tiger. But Riki the Rhino is everyone's favorite hero, right? Yeah. OK. So who wants to touch Riki's magical horn? Oh, yeah. I want to touch it. Me, I want to touch it. Well, pay up first. Yeah. Riki Con is officially open. Get your photo taken. Half price, a Riki special. Riki what? Riki Con, sold out. We're closed. We'll see you next year. Yes. Thanks for coming. Yes. Yes. Bye-bye. What are you up to now, Beni? You're still asleep. Go back to sleep. Hey, Hop. Hop, that's my commission. Hey, do you kiss your mother with that mouth? Riki, I can explain. You see, I told those guys... Told them what? Your heroism, your legend, all about you, all about your horn. It's your unique selling point. So I was thinking... Wait for it. We could be rich and famous. A bit of green to be seen. You know what I mean? What did I tell you? That your horn's not for sale. Hey, Beni, merchandise. Riki, where are you going? Look what we've earned already. I'm not interested. Seriously? An apple, a cabbage, some grapes, a plastic bottle. The jungle's not a trash can. Candy, fantastic! Beni, get off my horn. But that candy wants to eat me. Beni. No, no, no, wait. This is fun. Judge this. No, no, no, no, no, no autographs now. I'm busy. Don't even think about it. Beni, keep it down. No more quick rich schemes. Quit squirming. Come here. Yee-haw. Nice view. Wait. Not fair. Cheap move. I wasn't ready. I wasn't... Oh, my head. Riki, Riki. Just my duck luck. Oh, there you are. Riki. Riki, are you all right? I knew you'd beat that hunter. Of course, I did distract him with my brave attack. This is all your fault. Drawing attention to me with all your stories, flapping your bill across the jungle, bigging me up. And now everything is ruined. Huh? Don't fight. It'll be over soon. Stop struggling. You should enjoy your last few moments. It's time to accept your fate. You're going to look real good hung up on my wall. Just hold still. I don't know which way. Which way? I didn't do that. Yes, you did. It's OK. Leave it to good old Beni to sort this out. Don't be angry. Hey, why don't you watch where you're going? Riki, who's this joker? Yeah, that's it, Hop. Yeah, great. Yeah, that's good, real good. Now we can make Riki a new horn. How do you make a new horn? They don't grow on trees. Not bad. Keep focused. The horn should look fierce, nice, and sharp. Yikes. What are you doing? You know what a horn looks like. You drew the picture. We need something strong and white. Oh, it's so itchy. Aha! My feathers, really? Oh, like a pillow. Bigger, more feathers. Nearly, not quite. Calm down and give me some more feathers. Oh, this plucking hurts. That's got to be the one. I have nothing left to give. Riki's going to love it. Riki. Just go. Look what I brought you. I told you leave me alone. Oh, could you just take a look? Ta-da! What is that thing? It took me all day to make it... custom-made 100% Beni. I mean, look at me. I should be hanging in a restaurant window looking like this. Wait a minute. Do you think this is some kind of joke? Losing my feathers is no joke. Do you think a stupid feather horn would make me feel better? Well, I just wanted to help you. You've always been there for me, so I wanted to be there for you. But if you want to stay in this cave, wallow in your self-pity all day, fine. But we're supposed to be a team that helps each other. I don't need your help. Fine then, you bullheaded rhino. You should be ashamed, Riki. I know. I'm a hornless rhino. I should be ashamed. Your horn? I wasn't talking about your horn at all. You have been only thinking of yourself. Do you know whose feathers filled the horn that your friend gave to you? Beni has given you all of his feathers. And you have been blinded by rage. Beni. Beni. Come back. I'm sorry. Stubborn rhino. Stupid feather horn? They were my feathers. Oh. Nice lizard. Help. Oh, that was close... Too close. No feathers, now I'm doing my own stunts. What is this movie? Wait. Your shoe is untied. You fell for it. Whoa. Whoa. So did I. Beni! Oh, I got this. I'm in control. Aw. I mean that. I can't fly, but I can swim. Beni! It's harder without feathers. I've got you. Hold on. Beni! Beni! Beni, I'm really sorry. I messed up. I was just trying to help. But look, I'm wearing your horn. It's good. It's OK for now. But with a little teamwork, we can straighten everything out. Nice. You must be cold. No, I'm fine. Oh, yeah, sure. Wait. Aha! A bit of tree sap and some mud. Tada! Leaves as feathers? They won't last. See? Quick change. Let's roll with this. I call it log cabin chic. Oh, dear. Slim fit, a bit tight. A bit top heavy. I didn't literally want to roll with this. No more stunts. I want a stunter. Call my agent. This is harder than it looks. Let's get some help. Yo, Hop. We need your crazy sewing skills. You got anything for a featherless duck? Less duck a I'orange, more duck a la mud. Very duck a porter. Coming up. Oh, waistcoat wonder. Time to mend Riki's horn. Oh, snap. That was a third drum today. But at least, we know where that big bad kitty is hiding. Right, Geng? Cute, selfie. Hey, Bogeng. Oh. Yeah, bro? Get your gear ready because we're going to party. I mean your weapons. Oh. Today, you and me, are going to capture the king of the jungle. First, let's take a selfie. Cheese. Rara, you should leave that alone. Daddy, what is that thing? It's a human-made thing for sure. Do you remember what I told you? Humans, they're dangerous. That's right. And what do you have to do if you spot a human? Now you try it. It's all right. I'm sure someday you'll roar loud as me. Well, right. Black? Why didn't you find a matching patch with the same color? No worries. Just put it on. All right. Really? It looks good, but we've got to get you a real horn. It's just a temp fix. You can't wear that forever. We'll ask the tiger. We'll ask our king of the jungle. He'll know where we can get Riki a proper real horn. How do we find the king? Just follow the trail in our fancy map. Are you sure it's the right track? Just enjoy the view. Nothing can stand in our way. This way, Geng. Hey, Bogeng. Yeah, bro. I got a blip on the tracker. They must be pretty close to here. Here, kitty, kitty. Here, kitty. Be quiet. Just keep practicing, Rara. I know that your roar will come. And it'll be just as strong as mine. I'll never be able to roar as loud as you can, daddy. How will my stripes appear if I can't master my roar? Rara, look out. Watch out. Daddy! Roar! Run, Rara. Hurry. Get to safety. I don't want to leave you like this, daddy. Just go. Go now. Nice job. Give me five. It looks like it's time for a selfie. What's that? Oh, no. What do we do? What's the best way for us to talk to the king? Excuse me, Mr. King. Do you know where we can find a horn? No, that sounds like I'm asking for directions. What's that? You have to know the right way to address royalty. There's formalities, respect. Your Majestic Majesty, we are present before you on a matter of hornlessness. What do you think? Too much? You only get one chance to make a good impression. Oh, well, in that case, we're definitely screwed then. OK. I'll just be me. Your Majesty, king of the jungle. Hello. Sorry. It looks like the jungle king's a bit smaller than I thought. Please help. There were these two humans. And they caught my dad. I wonder if they're the same humans who stole your horn. Kitty. Here, kitty. Can I give him a name, bro? Divine or Cherry? Bogeng, don't play with him, OK? How many times have I told you? We are hunters. We're going to sell this tiger. A tiger as big as this one is with as such a nice shiny coat to boot will make us rich men. They're not the ones who stole your horn. I think you're right. You guys are still going to help me, right? Absolutely. Hey, bro. Look. It's funny. There's a cat on the water. What? Impossible. Let me see. That's definitely not a cat. That's a tiger cub. A tiger cub is pretty special. We could sell it as a pet and make even more money. All right, go get it. OK. How rude. This is PG-rated. No naked ducks. I found a chicken. He's cute. A chicken? Do I look like I cross roads for no reason? Roar. Huh? Oh, hello, cutie. You know this could go viral. All right. Let me get my phone out and take a picture. Bro, bro, I found a chicken. Take that duck far away from me, Bogeng. What's the matter, bro? He's cute. I'm allergic to duck. Get it away. Aw. I got the cat, though. Itchy. It's so itchy. Keep him busy. I'll get the key. Get her. Hurt her with that big one. Aw. Oh, no. Uh-oh. Hand me my gun. Oh, you're kidding me. The duck? Wait for me. You are such a brave little girl, Rara. I'm incredibly proud of you, young one. I owe it all to my new friends, daddy. Your Majesty. Thank you for coming to my aid, friend. Please accept this. We'll keep it in here. Presto. Your horn. Your Majesty. You see that's actually the reason why we are here. We were kind of hoping that maybe you knew where to find my friend Riki a new horn. Perhaps I can help you out. I know a place where more of your kind live. My kind? Well, OK, not exactly like you. Maybe they can give you one of their horns. Hey, it's the map again. Yep. You know what to do. Follow the trail. I'm feeling hungry. When are we going to eat? General, when are we going to eat? We'll eat when it's time for us to eat. Oh. But when is that? When are we going to eat? Hush. Let's stop here and break for lunch. Lunch? Let's eat. General? The pineapple. Doni, listen. You must go and find the antidote to this poison. Quickly, Doni, before it's too late. What does the antidote look like, general? It is a very special plant called bird's nest fern. Hurry, Doni. Oh, I got it, general. I'll definitely find it. Back ahead. So when we see more of your kind, will they be as ugly as you? Well, I did say duck. Hmm. Hear that? Hold on, Riki. It might be one of those evil humans. Up duck periscope. Riki, a horn! Huh? A horn, a horn! Hurry. Setting course for Cape Horn, we're veering left. Go right. Starboard, East, yep, yep. That's it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Keep going. Keep going. What about the horns? It's there. You have reached your destination. Huh? Oops. That could have hurt. Let's check he's OK. Hey. Excuse me. You're a bird, right? Could you fly up there and get me that? Well, yeah, technically, I am a bird. But I'm a duck. And this that can't fly... At least, not right now. I need that fern to cure my herd. They ate some poisoned fruit and might die unless I can reach the antidote across that ravine. Wait. Maybe you guys can help. What happened? What are you going to do with that? Watch and learn. Easy, easy. No need for a stunt... Beni! Oh, thank you, Riki. Hold on. You're a rhino tiger. How does that work? Do it again. Do it again. The tiger stone. I wonder if the king's gift is what changed you. It felt a bit weird. Is that bad? Oh, the antidote. Let's go. Let's get it to the general. Thank you, Doni. The general is feeling better. Wow. Wow. Yes, I feel much better. Riki, Beni, Doni, I'm so grateful for what you've done. What can we give you in return? Well, I see that you have two magnificent horns. Could we have one? I'm afraid that these are not horns, my friend. Huh? They're called tusks. But I know a certain master healer who can grow anything. Oh. Maybe he can grow your horn. Let's hope so. Tell me more. When I was a little bull, my father used to tell me about the magnificent master healer who can grow anything. Now follow along. Far across the land lived a master healer. He could create anything. Woo, funky flashback, or a bonkers back story. Whatever, I like it. Let's watch. All Of the kings and queens and their generals would bow to his power. And he would grant them their deepest desires. If he wanted food, it was yours. Fortune, it was It was yours and even, I expect, a horn. He would simply snap his fingers and anything would be possible. No stripes? Those tusks will do. Shoot em, Bogeng. OK. Ow! What happened? My head is spinning. Only a few special ones will be able to see him in person. And you, young one, you are quite special. Thank you, General. And thank you, Doni. Huh? Doni? Doni? Is that his name? Doni? Doni? Doni? Doni? Well? He's not here. This little one will do. He'll grow up soon. Take him, Geng. Got it, bro. Smells like our old friends are here. Who? Your friends? Huh? Where? Yahoo. Yee-haw. Run faster, Riki. Hurry. This is fast. Activate super rhino tiger. You need the stone. Yee-haw. What's that behind us? Some kind of tiger? No, bro. Here we come. It's a rhino. Yeah. But it looks like a tiger. Super Riki Rhino Tiger. Oops, Rhino Riki. Doni? Doni, Doni, wake up. Doni. Is it time to eat? Looks like you'll make it. Now, where did those two bozos go? Flying. Again, again. I want to go again. Hey, cut that out. Stop shaking the tree you big oaf! We got to get down. Whoa. Hey. Hey bro, I think those elephants are going to help us get down. Settle down, Bogeng. Shake the tree. No, no, no. Shake the tree. No, don't shake the tree. Wee, I can fly. If you want across the land, just follow the shoreline. Oh yeah, the General asked me to give this to you. Please accept this humble gift as a thank you. No, no, no. Thank you. We better get going. Come on, Riki. Oh, map on the move. I'm moving, you're just sitting there. Say what you want, it's water off a duck's back, or a duck on a rhinos back. We've reached the end of the line. Now we've got across the sea. Duck overboard. Hey, hey, maybe this will float our boat. Hey. I'm so sorry, but what are you doing buried in the sand? Oh, it's hatching. Wow. Hello baby turtle. I'm Uncle Beni. Now, why don't you run along to your mummy? Mama. Huh? No, no, no. I'm not mummy. This is your mummy here. Oops. My bad. But no harm, no foul. Have a nice day. Mama. No, no, no, please, don't cry. Mama. Make a funny face. Look, it's the Beni and Riki show. Come on, look at this funny mush. Well, I'm the funny one he's the straight man. I'm doing my best. I tried, OK? Hey, come on, tiny turtle. Go back to mama. Mama. Dinosaur. Crazy kid, so gullible. Sorted. Mama. Ah, not so gullible then. They're multiplying. Oh dear. Mama. Triple turtle, unless I'm seeing things. All right, children, it's time to go to the ocean. Oh, they're so cute. Oh no, my children, hurry back to shore. Watch out! Riki, do your thing, anything. Oh, that's new. Don't worry. Uncle Beni's got you. Right, seagull attack formation dead ahead. 11 o'clock, 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock. Yeah, all the clocks. Watch out behind you. Flocking seagulls. You give birds a bad name. Mama. Mama. So cute. Swim as far as you can, my dears. I can't imagine what would have happened if you hadn't helped. Please accept this as a token of gratitude. May it help you cross the sea. Thanks. Another one for the collection. Come swim with us. Check it out, turtle power. Now that floats my boat. Anchors away. This is as far as we're going. See you again, Uncle. Bye, Mama. I'm not your mo... Oh, forget it. Map time, here we go, straight across. Let's change the view, get down to sea level. Ow! What was that? What was that? Show your flippers. What? What? Oh no, Riki, wake up, sleepyhead. I am awake. Then how come we're sinking? Hey Riki, it's sink or swim. I think I prefer swim. Riki, Riki, Riki. Riki. Riki. Riki, there's a turtle stuck down there. We have to dive back and help him. Sink and swim? I think I can do that. Hurry up, Riki. There, I see him. Huh? Aha, I know. Super Rhino Tiger. There. Turtle time. Thanks, you guys. I thought I'd had it. You guys totally saved me. Where are you headed? We're looking for a master. You mean the one that grants you whatever you want? Yeah. Do you know him? I know something about him. I heard that he stands on two feet. You mean like a human? Yeah, dude, that's what I heard. Do you see that? Swim in the direction of that star. Thank you. Wait. I've got a present for you. Please accept it as thanks. Thank you. Too kind. Take care. You too. Bye, dudes. We made it. Beautiful land. Ow, ow, ow. Wow, that's put me in a crabby mood. Look, footprints. Something on two feet. Could these be the master's footprints, Riki? Must be. Hey, this is getting exciting. Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. Wow, what a collection. So big. I like those heads. Please have a seat. Hello? Sorry, Mr. Jak, we're a bit late. Well, you could say, we're fashionably on schedule, right? You're a couple of rookies. You're only on time if you're early. Are we there yet? Why is it taking so long? Enjoy the ride, bro. Bogeng? Huh? Coming, bro. All right, Bogeng. This is it. This time we have to catch one. We have to do better than all those other guys. We're almost there, Mr. Jak. Great. Welcome, my fellow hunters. You've been invited to join my hunt today, because you're the best of the best. This time our hunting trip will be a challenging one. You will either live or you will die. If any of you wish to leave, now's your chance to take the boat. Any takers? Do you have any questions? What are the rules of our hunting trip, sir? There is only one rule. And that rule is there are no rules at all. Now that that's settled, let the games begin. Hm? The scent is strong here. Hm? I don't smell anything. We're close. Huh? Whoa. Riki! Master... Slow down, buddy. Duck, Beni! Hey, Riki. Oh... ugh. Oh, great. I'll just catch the next rhino. Huh? Oh... must follow that enchanting sound. Is that the master? Huh? What is this place? He's on two legs. It must be the master. Oh! Master healer? Oh, please don't eat me. Hold on. You're not the master healer. Please don't eat me, sir. I need to bring this food to my parents. What? Huh? Wait! Daddy? Daddy, a monster. What are you doing here? I'm looking for a master healer that can grant wishes. If there were such a powerful master, I wouldn't have been shot. And we would still have a home. I'm afraid you won't find one here. Just have a look around this place. Do you see any miracles here? So it was all just made up? He doesn't exist? Oh... too good to be true. Sorry to waste your time and mine. Hm. Hey, wait. Hold on. Stop, mister. I might know the one you're looking for. But my father told me never to go near him. Because he's kind of different. Where is he? There. Whoa. Do you see that old human-made building? That's where he lives. And it's very creepy. Every night, some strange sounds come out of there. I'm sure of it. There must be something there. Hm. I'm going to have to take a look up there. I've come this far. I might as well check it out. I'll go too. No way. You should listen to your father. I'm coming. I've already got a sidekick. Beni, tell this cheeky monkey. Hey, Beni? What? Wow. Hm? Huh? Oh... I have a star fruit. I have fruit, Your Highness. I have a gift. I feel like eating fish. Yes. Would you fetch me one? Right away, Your Highness. What a bunch of lame ducks. Hm. Ah. Easy like a duck to water. Hm? Huh? Hey. Hook, line, and sinker. Huh? I have some delicious grapes, princess. Hm? I caught a small fish. Uh-uh. Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo. Hm? What is that? Mmm! Oh! What is that smell? Et voila. Fresh fishy, mademoiselle? Prepared especially pour vous. And la fork? Oh, no fork. OK. Not bad. You may call me Bebeb. Enchanté. Beni! What is that creature? La Majesty, let me introduce you to mon ami, Riki la Rhino. Riki, this is Princess Bebeb. What are you doing? What's with that accent? Is this your new girlfriend or something? Ew! Don't be ridiculous. As if I'd ever fall for a low-class bald duck like him. Oh, mais no, no, no, no. Zut alors. Merci buckets. Une moment. What are you doing? You're going to blow it for me. I'm trying to make a move. Beni, I think I found the healer. Huh? You found him? Well, why didn't you say so? Let's go. Hm. Who's that? That kid's our guide. Hm. Bleck. Yo ink. What happened to your feathers? Why are you so bald? Bald is the new beautiful. Where are you guys going? On a quest, mon cheri. I shall return. Oh. Mwah. Take care. Au revoir. Let's go. Huh? We're getting close to them. Huh? These bananas are real sweet. Shoot him down. Oh! Ow! What are you, some kind of fool? You, get it together or you get out of here. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. We got it together. Don't worry. We're... we're prepared. We totally are. He's a serious guy, right, bro? I'm beginning to think that Serious is his middle name. Quiet, Bogeng. Huh? Did you all hear that? Loud and clear. Sorry, too many bananas. You're a disgrace. Huh? Rhino! Rhino! I saw a rhino. Don't be a fool. There are no rhinos in Kalimantan. They're extinct. And I know that for sure, because some of them are hung up in my lounge. Get your eyes checked. But I saw one. Sure. Huh? What are you waiting for? Ah-ha. Super Rhino Tiger time. Let the hunt begin. Watch out! Get back! I caught you now. Retreat! When I give you the sign, run straight for the trees. But darling... Save the others. Let me face these monsters. I've got a bead on this one. No. This one's mine. Man versus monkey. Let's do this. Mr. Jak... left jab. Watch out! There's no way you can win. Hey, that's not fair. Let's get him! They're swarming, Mr. Jak. Attack! Are you sure someone lives here? Excuse me? Go away! Huh? Do not disturb me! We've come a long way to see the all powerful monkey. I'm pretty sure I just told you all to go away, didn't I? What's behind this curtain? Don't touch that. Master, we've journeyed from afar in search of a miracle. You're looking for a miracle? You've come to the right place, my friend. Cool. Anything is possible, so long as you believe it can be. Ta-da! Wow! Pick a card. Think I can guess? Hm. It's the ace of hearts. Not hearts? Are you sure? Miraculous, right? We were hoping for something more... You want something more thrilling? Well, step right this way. Do not try this at home. It's only for professionals. Hey, this isn't in my contract. I'm half the duck I was. Ta-da! Huh? A miracle! That's not what I was thinking. Stop right there. I can read your mind. I bet that you would like to see... Whoa. What I need is for you to grow me a new horn and feathers for Beni. Can you do that? A new horn, eh? Feathers? I'm afraid I can't do that. But how about this? Huh? Hm. Eh. A horn and some feathers. Wait a minute. A horn, a horn, a horn, a horn, a horn. Nope. I can't help you. However, I can do this. So then, you're just a cheap trickster. You thought I could perform actual miracles? If I could, do you really think I'd be stuck in this place? Wait. We've come all this way for nothing? So that dove sent us on a wild goose chase. Hey! I'm just spreading the news. You should always double-check your sources. I should double-check you too, troll bird. What do you think? Hm? Ta-da! Danger! Humans are capturing the monkeys. Oh, sure. Like we should believe you now. Let's just go home. It's true-coo-coo. No, it's not. Yes, it is. It's not. It's not. It's not. It is. Beni, why don't we go outside and look? All right. Fine. But don't you blame me if it's fake news. OK? The monkeys need our help. The dove was right. Father! Oh. You're a tough specimen. You have shiny fur and perfect teeth as well. Dead or alive, I'll be sure to get a good price for you. Huh? It's him. Riki! That's the hunter that took your horn. It's him. You're right. Let's teach him a lesson. How can we get down there quickly? Rhino Tiger, locked and loaded. Father! Father! Forget about me. Rescue your mother. So there is a rhino here. We're not afraid of you. We're super-powered. Don't make my friend angry. You wouldn't like him when he's angry. This one looks familiar. There's something strange about him, too. Ah-ha! Does this belong to you? Super Rhino Tiger time! Riki? Too bad. A hornless rhino is really quite worthless. Turtle power? Elephant rhino? Knock him out. Anything. Huh? It's the alarm. Hunt's over. We better retreat before the forest rangers find us. Yeah, let's go. We have to save our brothers, our sisters, and our friends. Who will join me? Me and Riki will. Won't we, Riki? Riki? Riki? Riki? Hey. Where are you going? Home. Home? But these guys need our help. I can't help anyone. I'm a hornless rhino, OK? I always will be. But you're so much more than that now. We can really help here. Without my horn, I'm nothing at all. That hunter has taken my horn. Yeah. So what if he has your horn? Not having a horn isn't the end. It is the end for me. You saw how I totally froze up when I faced him just now, right? There is no miracle cure. And we will never win the fight against the hunters. So you're turning your back? I'm turning around. There's a difference. You coward. What did you say? I called you a coward. You heard. Hmmph. Whatever. I'm going home. I'm not going to let those hunters hurt those families. And look at me. I'm just a duck. I've got no powers, no feathers, but my new friends need my help. And friends help each other no matter what. I thought we were friends. And now you're just going to leave? Well, I'm staying. I'm going to help. Yay! All right! Fine. You go your way. I'll go mine. Anyone else? I'm in. Sure. Let's do. Yeah, I'll go too. Ugh. Ugh. Hm? Leave me alone. That's not real. Neither are you. Once upon a time, there was a young proboscis monkey who was kept captive by an evil human. Amazing! Come on. Huh? Hmmph. All right. I was raised by humans. I thought that was going to be my life forever until one day... What the? Hey! Hey! Hm. You're free now. Come on out. Good. Hm. You're free. Huh? That human changed my life forever. It was on that day that I realized evil doesn't always win. For in the end, goodness will always find a way to prevail. You may not be able to see it now, but if you didn't have the courage to take the first step, how would you know the outcome? My mother told me once to follow my horn. And where is your horn then? In the front, right? Perhaps what she meant is to always look ahead. You're right. My mother told me to always look ahead... Not to look back. Don't dwell on the past. Now you're talking. True strength doesn't lie in your horn. It resides within you. They're getting ready to go. We've gotta act fast. Yeah, you're right. Attack! Hold on. We can't just rush in. We'll need a plan and some more help. We need to recruit more troops and spread the word. Hm. We've got quite a mixed team here. Let's play to our strengths. Hm. Who's a good look-out? Yeah, I am. Hm. Now we need some muscle. I'll do it. Hm. Thanks for the offer, but we need someone with less hop, more pow. Someone who's strong and big... A heavyweight. Hm? Hey. Why is everyone looking at me? I lost two kilos last week. We need a strong line of defense... Someone who's rock solid and reliable. Mhm. Count us in. Yes! Yeah. Now let's attack! No. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. It's time for a pre-match pep talk. What? All right. Here's what we're up against. If we're going to get to the cages, we need to take down the big hunter. But he's surrounded by his team. So bam! We go in hard, front and center, but take them by surprise from the sides and distract the last two defenders. Quack Attack. The brave hero faces off against the evil villain. And duck and dusted. The crowd go wild. I know. Pretty great, right? Quack Attack too much? Huh? Were you even listening? OK, let's do a quick recap. Who's coming in front and center? Ugh. OK. Very well then. Let's break it down bit by bit, one animal at a time. Listen for the whistle. Hm. First positions. Go, Bear. You're up front. Hey. Oh! And cue elephant. You're the center. Hm. Aw. You've got to concentrate. What about me? We'll get to that. Jungle Cat and Stag... Where's Stag? Anyone seen Stag? I need Stag for the surprise from the sides. Hey, hey, hey. You don't need to run yet. Huh? Bear? What are you doing? Ignore the whistle. Ignore the whistle. Stop, please, stop. Goal! Why am I always the butt of the joke? Oops. Come on, Bear. You can do this. Push harder. Don't surrender. I believe in you. You can do it. OK, take a break. I'm done. Claws... these are your natural weapons. Good for the surprise attack. Everyone stay sharp. Give it a go. Ouch! It was Beni's idea! Oops. Huh? Goal! Way to go, you great, big hunk of trunk. Look who's coming to try again. Now we're ready. Hurry up. It's getting dark already. We have to leave pronto. Huh? He's cute. Hey. Hey, bro. These guys are really cute. Look at his little nose. Come on. Just a little closer, a little closer. Ow! Huh? Ugh, Bogeng. Why do you keep fooling around? Why does it seem like they're laughing at us? Cut it out. They're just animals. They don't understand anything. Come on. We've got to load them up. Daddy! Our job here is not yet complete. We meet again at 4:00 AM. We've work to do. Team Hedgehog, time for a prickle tickle. All right. Mighty Mice, move out. Yeah! Huh? Ah. Hm. Mhm! Huh? Hm? Uh-uh. Bear, heave ho. Bonjour, madam... wah! Before we leave this place, we should leave our signature on the land. We will leave a mark of fire and devastation. Go cut down those trees. Mr. Jak, with respect, we are here to hunt. We didn't come here to cut down trees. Use your brain. The animals that we are hunting are endangered. The rarer they are, the more valuable they become. We'll destroy their habitat. Their price will skyrocket. Once we clear this forest, we will control the market. Excuse me. Do you mean that all the animals in the forest will die? Yes, that's what I mean. Bro, you told me we were hunting these animals so they could be pets... Not to be murdered. Stop talking rubbish. Just follow Mr. Jak's orders. I wonder where you're going to live now, little guy. Bro? What? What is that? Stop talking. Give me a hand. Look. Just look. Look. That must be the spirit of the trees cursing us. He's angry with us, because we cut down the trees. Ugh. You watch too many scary movies. I see it now, buddy. This... this... this is a bad dream. Ow! Bogeng, what did you just hit me for? To wake you up from your dream, bro. Are we celebrating? Happy birthday. Happy birthday, bro. Was that a gunshot? Let's split up. Check it out. Hm. Hey! Hm. Uh-oh. Hm? This one should be easy. Yeah. Whoa! Huh? Ow! Huh? Eh? Chop them down. Step closer to me. Huh? Thanks for lending your mud hole. Hyuh! Where are you going, you little squirt? Huh? Huh? Huh? Just a bit more, Bogeng, a bit more. Oh! Ow. Ouch. Ugh. Come on. Grab my hand. Well, Geng, how come you didn't jump out of the hole earlier? In the spirit of togetherness, bro. Oh, geez. Hm. I was looking for this. Don't shoot. Move it! What? Hello. Huh? Save yourself. I'm going to take you back to Mr. Jak. You're hurting my arm. Ow! Mr. Jak has ways of dealing with guys like you. Huh? Goal! It's time to fly like a bird. What are you going to do now? Look out behind you! Oh, are you trying to trick me? Hm? Huh? You dare attack a little one? Are you all right? Yeah. Thanks for saving me. You're welcome. Mr. Jak, Mr. Jak! What's going on? What took you so long? Mr. Jak, look. Right. They're all here. Fantastic. This is what I call a jungle party. Yeah! Ugh! Uh-oh. Whoa! What's happening? Very well. Quack Attack! No, wait. Duck and Dusted... what was it? Huh? Riki! Hop on, Beni. Huh? You come back for round two, eh? Let's use the stones. Huh? Blow him away. That's it. You're dead. Riki! Riki, use this. Huh? Monkey Magic? Go shoot the Rhino Tiger. Try the Monkey Magic. This is new. Hey, that was mine. I just thought he'd look awesome like that. Rhino Tiger! Riki... What's this? Where's your horn? This soft horn is pathetic. No! Why can't you leave us alone? Chicken! You won't get away this time. Attack! Attack! Attack! Animals can never win... Not against humans. What's your plan now? Come here. What can you do to me without a horn? You don't even have that fake one. Baby chicken. I'm not a chicken. I'm a duck with pluck. Ow! Time for a quick exit. Bogeng, where are you going? Stop hiding. What are you doing? Help me to tie up this rhino. No, sir. I don't want to hurt any more animals. I'm running out of patience with you. Hey. Let him go now. He's my best friend. Don't you dare hurt him. You two are just a couple of losers. We are not losers! Bro! Riki, we can't outfight them. But we've got to put out the fire, save the jungle. Just let them fight each other. They're gone. Ducks. Oh, my my. It looks like someone is learning how to swim. Get them, boys. You were right, Beni. We can't outfight them. But we can outsmart them. Let's end this right here and now. Look in the direction of your horn and run as fast as you can. Look up! You think you're winning right now? Well, you're not going to win, because humans will always win. Let's all die together. Riki, there's no way out. Wake up, bro. Fire! Riki! Just want to say, you may be a rhino without a horn, but you're the best rhino I know. I'm the only rhino you know, Beni. Well, that's true. Rainy, rainy, I will make it pour down. Make it, make it make it, make it rain hard. It worked! My rain dance performance actually worked. Looks like I can perform miracles. All right! We drove the hunters away! All right, Riki! They love you. We all do. Good job! I guess I love you, too. We did it! Hooray! Yeah! OK, so you're a rhino without a horn. But this is better than nothing. How did you make this? You don't have any feathers left. Huh? What about you, Riki? Have you found what you were looking for? No. But I found I don't need a real horn to be a real rhino. A little bird told me that far in the East, there are those of us who know how to grow things back. Huh? Another little bird, huh? You can feel the breeze. And the animals are all roaming free. Living in harmony is the way it should be. We're all part of Earth's family. And no one is the same. Let me stand in one name. Come together with nature as one. For the beauty of the land, for the beauty of the seas can be seen from all the corners of the world. Let us stand hand in hand for the forest and the trees. Build a future for this land we call our home. For the beauty of the lands, for the beauty of the sea. And we see from all the corners of the world. Let us dance hand in hand for our forests and the trees. Build a future for this land we call our home. For the beauty of the land, for the beauty of the seas. And we sing from all the corners of the world. Let us stand hand in hand for our forests and the trees. Build a future for this land we call our home. For the beauty of the land, for the beauty of the seas. And we sing from all the corners of the world. Let us stand hand in hand for our forests and the trees.
