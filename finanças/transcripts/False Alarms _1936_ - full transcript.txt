[♪] The hottest fire we've had in a long time. Yeah, we need more help around here. Say, where are those three chuckleheads? Oh, those three nuts? Yeah. Ha. I guess the squirrels got 'em. Ah, no such luck. Ring the bell. I'll take care of them. Hey, you three up there! [HUMMING] [BELL RINGING] [HUMMING] [CLEARS THROAT] [CLEARS THROAT] Hey. Do you hear a bell? What?! I said, did you hear the bell?! Uh, what did you say?! The bell! The bell! I can't hear you on account of the bell. Must be a fire! A fire! Hey, it's a fire. Come on. Get smart here. Wait a-- We don't wanna miss another one. We ain't gonna miss it. Wait a minute. Wait for me. All right, hurry up. Hi, cap. Come on, you'll miss the fire. [WHOOPING] I'm blind. I can't hear or can't see you. Hey, wait for me. Hey. Grab the net-- Whoo. [GRUNTING] Get up. Why don't you look before you fall? I got soap in my eyes. I can't see. Oh! Oh. There you are. Why weren't you three at the fire? We just got up. We was taking a shower. Oh! Captain. You know how it is. We was out shaking our tootsies with the girls last night. Just why did you three half-wits join the fire department? So we wouldn't have to buy any tickets for the Fireman's Ball. Nyuk-nyuk-nyuk-nyuk, nyuk-nyuk-- Yeow! A comedian, eh? Now, listen-- You listen! You've ditched fires, slept through alarms, been late for duty, and broken every rule in the book. You're through. You're fired! And if this were the Army, I'd have you shot at sunrise. But you couldn't do that, captain. We don't get up that early. Oh! Come on. Now, listen, cap. You wouldn't turns us out into the cold, cruel world. Supposing it was snow, and we freeze? Yeah. It'd be cruelty to animals. Oh, girls love us in these uniforms. Aw, captain. Give us another chance, will you? We'll put a fire out single-handed. We'll put two fires out double-handed. We'll even start a fire and have you put it out. Well, I guess I'm just an old softy. I'll give you another chance. But remember! This is the last one. [ALL CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Now, get to work and wash that hose. We gotta come through for the captain. And the crew. And Alma maybe too. Come on. Get busy! [WHOOPING] Whoa. There's your new car, captain. It's the prettiest one in the shipment. Boy, she is a beauty. I've been saving months for that baby. Yeah, take it kind of easy the first 500, will you, cap? Don't worry. I will. Oh. Hey, look at my new-- Come on. Come on. Captain's looking for us. We're sorry, captain. It was all a mistake. Yeah. He forgot to throw the bucket. Think nothing of him. We'll have you cleaned up in a jiffy. Take it easy, now, fellas. Look what you're doing to the captain's coat. Now it matches his hat. Stop it! Oh. Ungrateful, huh? I should have you fired, but you'll keep working here till you pay for this suit. Hey, you. Roll those hose lines out. [SPLASH] Say, let's get this over with, and I'll ask the captain to let us off tonight. We're invited to Maisie's house to a birthday party. Oh, boy. Plenty of pigs' knuckles smothered in garlic. Ha! She's got a couple new girls for us to meet too. Oh, a blind date, eh? She ain't blind. She may be a little hard of hearing. Yeah-- Uh-- Come on, get moving here if you wanna get out. [HUMMING] Whoop! Oh. Look at our little baby hoses. Quintuplets. Marie, Annette, Yvonne... Hey. What? Don't disturb the rest of 'em. They're asleep. [SQUEALS] Come on. If the captain sees us, we're through. Roll 'em up and get 'em hid. Hurry up now. [CAR HORN HONKING] [BRAKES SCREECH] [WHINES] Here's my roll. Hm. Got any more in your hands? No. Oh! Oh. Oh! Ooh! Hah! I'm caught! Ooh! Oh! Whoo! Ow! Isn't it pretty, girls? Gee, it's swell. Oh. Let's eat. Oh, I-- I wonder why Curly and his friends haven't shown up. It's me. I'm a Jonah. I guess the only way I can get a man to come and see me is to call a doctor. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Come in. [GIRLS GIGGLE] Happy birthday, Maisie. [NYUCKS] Hello, Curly. Curly, this is Mimi, and this is Minnie. Hi, Mimi. Hi, Minnie. I'm Minnie. I'm Mimi. I'm hungry. Well, sit down. Take a load off your feet. It ain't my feet that hurt. Oh! [WHIMPERS] Oh, gracious.

Now, so I don't get tempted, I'm gonna stay in here with you. What's the idea? Give me that key? You really want it? Yeah. Oh! Oh, a wise guy. I got a good mind to make you go down that pipe after it. How would I get in there? How? Wait. I'm only clowning. Wait! Oh! I don't fit. My head! Come on, pudgy. You be my fella. Stop. Cut it out. [BABBLING] Cut it out. The birthday cake. Oh, my cake. [WHOOPING] Oh. [WHOOPING] Look. I got it! Oh, isn't that cute? Do it again. [ALL GASP] Oh, wait. [WHINES] Stop! Oh, dear. Wait. Aagh! Oh.
