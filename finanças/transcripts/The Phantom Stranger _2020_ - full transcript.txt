Yeah! Like there it is, baby! Welcome to California! I can't believe I'm actually here. Believe it, Sister. This is where it all beings. But you're sure it's cool right? I can crash with you guys at your friend's place? He doesn't even know me. Aw it's cool alright. Seth's door is always open. To the right kind of people Seth told us we should always be on the lookout for cool young people... ...who see the system for what it is, Marcy. 5 minutes with Seth and you'll know escaping your parents suburban prison was the best thing you've ever done. Yeah, they were so hung up on keeping up with the Jonses they lost touch with their souls. Well, Seth knows all about souls... You'll see. It is said, "Not all those who wander are lost." But many are. And once lost... ...they may truly be lost forever. Home again, home again, jiggety-jig Lucky for us, weren't stopped by no pig Be it ever so crumbly, there's no place like home That's some statue. Yeah, it reminds me of my old man after he's had a few Pretty out of sight, isn't it? It used to belong to some old-time movie actor What matters is that it's Seth's now. And what's his... is ours. Yeah, we share and share alike. Let's get inside already. I really have the munchies. Wouldn't mind a sandwich myself before the festivities begin Is there some kind of party tonight? Wherever Seth is, there's always a party. He's where that happening, is happening, man Come on. Great. I just need a minute to get my head together Ugh. The reflection is just an illusion The greatest wisdom is seeing through appearances. Who are you... Oh! You must be their friend, their guide or whatever... ...sati... No, I'm afraid not. Good. A decent guru wouldn't be caught dead in my dad's hat. Hmm. Why do friends follow this man? I don't know. I haven't even met him yet. I suppose we're all looking for something our parent's generation doesn't care about. Truth, I guess. Truth lies not at the end of the road, but inside those who walk the road. Right. What did you say your name was? I didn't but there are some who know me as... ...The Phantom Stranger. Well, you certainly are strange nice. Nice meeting ya. I wouldn't go in there if I were you. You're not like them... not yet. You don't know me. You don't know anything about me So just buzz off! Weirdo. Come in! Come in already! There you are! We thought maybe you'd escaped our clutches! So, where's the much-discussed Seth Don't sweat it. He'll come when the time is right. Man likes to make an entrance - Is that him? - Are you kidding? It's Jonathan Lord, the actor. Don't you watch old movies? This house used to belong to him before he gave it to Seth He gave it to him? Why would anyone-? People will give you just about everything they have? All you have to do is let them. I'm Seth. Pleased to meet you Marcy. You know my name? I know you... so pure and true. Searching for meaning in a world all screwed up by war... ...pollution and lies. I was once like you. I journeyed far and wide trying to find my purpose on this little pebble in space. Then... I discovered the secret. I found my true self... my calling. And what is that? Helping other people find their true selves. Once that happens... ...any place you are, is where you are meant to be. Heavy. My friends have done well bringing you here. Please stay. The night is young. I've never met anyone like you. There is no one else like me, Marcy. It's stupid. I'm frightened of you and drawn to you at the same time. There's nothing to be frightened of. I give you purpose. You give me... ...life. You won't have her, Seth. You feasted enough on these children. They come willingly. They do my work for me. Not this one. She doesn't know what you are. Let her go. Now! Only a true innocent can defeat me. And we both know... You're far from innocent. You've infested this plane too long, Seth. Tonight, it ends. Hah. I don't think so. The power of the Ouroboros pendant assures me end less time. It's my circle of everlasting life. Let's test that theory. Your power is waning, Dark One. I have more than enough to finish you. Stranger, wait! I have great power. I can offer you much. Even end your wandering. We can help each other. I will help, Evil One. I'll end the eons of misery you've inflicted on others. Well done, my dear. You're my very favorite house guest in centuries. I don't understand. What's happening? Who is this guy? Don't you recognize him, Marcy? He's the man. He's the sister. The status quo. Marcy... you must get away from here. He is a blight! No! He's good! You're the invader here. Seth's appearance is a lie. Don't believe him! Your aura is remarkable stranger. You are positively brimming with life. Unlike you, Seth. You walk this realm in living death. A parasite! I'll live off you for a hundred years. No longer will I be reduced to draining scraps from these lost whelps. Run Marcy! Run! They barely whetted my appetite. You searched for the truth, Marcy. What do you think of it? It's... so... groovy. My mind is blown, Seth. Your power... It's a shining brilliant thing. You walk in eternity. The King of Ages. But you don't have it all, not yet. Don't you know what every king needs. A queen. I was searching for my purpose, my truth... and I found it. I found you. Darling child. Nooo! Ahh! You little bitch. I'll... kill... you... Ahhh! Ick. I'll have you free in a minute I hoped you would make the right choice. What now, Marcy? Keep searching for your truth? Truth truth lies not at the end of a road, but inside those who walk the road. I'll keep traveling for now. Who knows what I'll find, but... I'll bring my own truth with me. How does that sound, Stra-?
