I can explain. -Told you, stay away. There. Browse, browse, browse. I know, but Wilbur understand... -He sold the aunty yet another vacuum cleaner and you? -Me? Forget about it. It'll have to be more cutting before he can sell me anything. -Yeah, yeah. Where is Theofil? Gone to the seaside. Help! Ok, Ambrose. So, what did he sell you this time? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. -Nothing? So what about that case? Yeah. -Well, just that's. Case with nothing in it. Do you really mind, ha? Do you think, it always need to contain things? I say no. No, to the tyranny of minus consumption? No, to the... -It's booze. It's whisky. Come on. Let me see it. -It's not whisky. It's... it's... a cough medicine. -Let me see. Come on, Lucy. Let go of it. Good for my health. Now look what you did. Hey. What is this? So, have you found the case with the missing Ranger? Well, the thing is that case got shipped to Boston couple of days ago, boss. -A, Boston. The Red Socks ruins the Celtics, The Patriots bill belly check Tom Brady and cream pie. -The guy must be dead, boss. Dead? Brady? No. No. No. Brady. Brady. If someone finds that Ranger, my plans will be exposed. I want that case back. -Get up, Manuel. Come on. Call Bill. Oh, Brady no... He's wearing an cowboy outfit. Yeah, he's a Texas Ranger, like in our game. I had never seen anything like it. This tiny band yet complete. Well, professor. Professor? Oh, yes. Well... This is obviously human being of the male persuasion. Everything is there. Two arms, two legs. Something just shrunk him. Quite a lot. Sounds like a thunderstorm coming. It's Wilbur's stomach. It's a bit empty. Go have a look in the kitchen, Wilbur. There's a fridge. Help yourself. Some people might actually been thirsty, professor. Absolutely. Good point, Ambrose. Our Ranger is completely parched. He needs water badly. What? Oh, yes, yes. That's exactly what I meant. Look at my jacket. That Wilbur think he's strong, does he? Hey, you! What do you think you're doing? Boemerang. -Bill? Those cases with whiskey you bought from us yesterday. Where are they? I suggest I keep him here overnight for observation. Drop or two and he'll be a lot better. That's good, professor. We will be back tomorrow. Come on, kids. It's getting really late. Well, has Wilbur got? My guess, this store hasn't finished yet. Look, Ambrose. You left the front door open again. That's impossible. Stop. We've been burglarized. Take a deep breath. Nobody move. Thank you. I must have the investigation. One foot prints. The burglar had at least one leg. And he can writes. Uh, you're so smart. How do you know? He left the letter on the wall. Sorry for the mess, Ambrose. I did not find the case of whiskey, but if you really want to enjoy your retirement, bring the case to the Anchor bar and come alone. So, not with two or more people but alone. That means not with the hundred or more or two hundred or more. I guess, he means alone. -My thoughts exactly. The Anchor is a city's seller joint in a harbor. I'll go. I know it well. -Oh, yeah? Hm, only by reputation. Are you Ambrose? You did come alone, right? Whiskey or did you bring your own bottle? I asked, did you bring the bottles? -Bottles? But why the bottles? To get the money? They want those bottles back in Texas, you clown. Give them to me or else. -How did that Texas Ranger get in that bottle? A Ranger? I haven't a clue. Through the bottle neck? And who shrank him and why? And how? And how often? -Listen Mr. Jeopardy, did you bring the bottles or not? You have enough to drink. You don't need another bottle. Is that so? His memory is failing, guys. I think, he'll need a kick. Oh, no, you don't. So, are you gonna talk now? I don't know anything. We work for Bill Buster of the Seahawk. He's your mad. -You see? Why didn't you say so right away? Alright. This drinks for you but in moderation. Good night, gentlemen. Oh, God. It's Ambrose. Look what you done, you clown. -Me? You are the one who wanted to come here in the first place. You told me to hit the first guy they came out. Did I tell him to hit Ambrose? No. Oh, don't start now. I shouldn't drink any more. Just one sip of whiskey and my head hurts. -Yeah. Ambrose, your head hurts because of me. Did you find anything out in there? Yes, Bill Buster of the Seahawk. He's a man. The Seahawk. That's a ship. Come on, Luke. I'm coming with you. Hold on. Is that the stick you hit me over the head with? Yeah. Oh, may, then it's high time I fainted. Oh, Ambrose. What we do now? Taxi. The Seahawk. That's it. How we'll find Bill Buster here? Well, just ask around. Excuse me, do you know where I can find Bill Buster? Cabin seven. -Thank you. Stupid animal. Don't wake me for that. Six. Oh, it's here. Shell we knock first or do we just walk in? It's not gonna be that simple. He's got a gun. Hold on. Come on. There you go. All right. Just a little bit further. You see? Yeah. Come on. Come on. Good evening. -Freeze. Don't move. What shouldn't you be in bed right now? I'm asking the questions here. What do you know about that Texas Ranger in the whiskey bottle? -What Texas Ranger? What bottle? Maybe you don't realize who you dealing with? This is Luke the Clown. Luke the Kid. He's the sharpest shooter in town. Get him, Kid. OK. OK. Easy. I work for Jim Parasite. The biggest whiskey distillery in Texas. Moonshine whiskey. We sold some cases to Boemerang and the boss wants them back. And why is that? Hold on a minute. Hey, that's my gun. And that gun's not loaded. Hey, stop or I'll... shoot. Stop. I said stop. Hey. Did you just knock? Come on, get inside. Good night, Bill. Bill Buster said, that the bottles came from distillery in Texas, owned by a guy, called Jim Parasite. -Jim Parasite? Where is he? Easy now. Easy. You are safe here. Nice to meet you. I'm Lucy and this is my brother Luke. What happened to you? I'm Tom from the Texas's Rangers. I been shrunk by Jim Parasite. Parasite is a crock, who terrorized a Dark city with his gang. The Sheriff couldn't hold it him, so, they sent me and my men. We almost got them too but... Parasite got a hold of some magic powder. He shrunk me and all the other Rangers, but I got away. Parasite planning terrible things. I have to go back. Forget about it. That's a job to big for a man so small. Besides, we need to find an antidote do you mind keep on shrinking. Someone has to stop him. Please. -Aunty? Go to Texas. Yeah, that's not small fit. It could be dangerous. I don't know such an expedition is doom to fail without a real leader. That's a problem. You know, leadership is a rare quality. You if either got it or you don't, right? So, it's important to choose the right leader a specially if you... -Say Ambrose. Me? Ok, I accept. Thanks for a lot of confidence. I'll be the leader of this expedition as such I say, I, We... What we want to do again? Yes. We're going to Texas. -Yeah. Hello. Boss? I found that Ranger. Yeah. But there is a small problem. What? Get rid of that Ranger and the professor immediately. Nobody will stop me. I will be the biggest, the greatest, I tell you. The greatest. The king. Please, save me to that country where the eagles fly, where the wolf how the love some... Take me where the rocks are colored red and my Texas girlfriends name is Ginger Red. O,o, let's go to the land of Utah, honey. O,o, let's go to the land of Utah, honey. Please take me where the mountains are mountain high. Where time is on my side. O,o, let's go to the land of Utah, honey. O,o, let's go to the land of Utah, honey. Please save me where the foxes the rules and debase. Live together in the harmony. O,o, let's go to the land of Utah, honey. Has anyone see an Ranger's office yet? I hope they have a hair dryer. And fridge. I'm hungry. Are you hungry again? -Wilbur always hungry. Right there. It's over there. Over there. Yeah. I found the composition of the shrinking powder in ancient texts. It's made of the tiny wini bush, very rare plant. It's only grows in American south west. From the plant's DNA we take the genes that keep the bush so small. Ready? Why didn't that work? I was absolutely certain. These things happen, doc. Better luck next time. One, two. One, two. Test. Test. Test. You look great in this. Yes, especially me. Oh, Ambrose. You look wonderful. I always say, the love is blind. Come on, Luke. Check out the neighborhood. -Yeah. Wilbur and I will visit the Sheriff office maybe... Ambrose, watch out! Gosh, is quite excited. It's a badge. Must be the Ranger's horse. Maybe she's Ranger's Tom horse? Oh, poor thing. Look how sad she looks. Easy, girl. Don't worry, your boss is completely safe with us. Our professor will do everything he can to cure him and then will come back to you, ok? Ambrose new girlfriend. Make good par. Betty horse, Ambrose donkey. Hi. -Hi. Good day, sir. Howdy. -Get inside. Let's take a look over there. Good day, sir.

He has been here a few times. He's an excellent salesman. Do you know him? -Do we ever. Great. So, what did you want to buy? We looking for the shrinking Rangers. Shrinking Rangers? Shrinking Rangers? We seem to be all out those right now but I can order some more. Now, come on. We just here to help. Do you know what happened to them? And who is this Jim Parasite? Ku-ku, ku-ku. Gosh, look at the time. Closing time. Time to go. It was very nice to meeting you. Bye-bye. But... What was that all about? -Who knows. Hi. -Hello. We are the new Texas Rangers. New Rangers? Why new Rangers, pal? What's wrong with the old ones, ha? Well, they have been shrink in bottle, do you know? Get out of here. Who told you that? You know, the Rangers left because was absolutely nothing to do here. -Yeah, right. Liar. No, it's true. Nothing ever happened in Dark city. It's a boring town. And this Parasite who terrorizes everyone? Oh, that's just an old tale. You know, cowboys stories. So, you don't need us here? Of course not. It's under control. What is that? -A party? Come on. You don't scare me. Come on. Do you hear that? Someone has to tell them they have to stop for playing around like that. It's dangerous. Come on. That cowboys are paid the horse around. Ok, ok. Let's start. I'm a bad girl that what's they say just because I sing all night and sleep all day I'm a bad girl but my heart not made of wood want some sweet lovin' daddy come and make me be good. He could be strong for me big and brawny for me so sweet to me soft and need for me. He never go out fishing he'll be missing Missy's kissin oh, wild the girl I could be. I'm just a soul girl see you lonely in the world and I'm ready for some papa to come along and hapa be my dream and make a real good girl out of me. I'm not a bad girl. Watch out. You can swallow a fly. Hey, guys. We got visitors. So, what brings the short barley and the lady with the big feet, two shorty's and a baldy to our beautiful town? We're here to restore order. Mama, help. First, you will need to prove you brave enough to be a real Ranger, you little pipsqueak. Showdown. Showdown. Showdown. Hey. Ojla. -I'm not afraid. Bring it on. Allow me to interrupt, but this calls for real hero, Luke. By the way, if you have newspaper here I'm Ambrose with an "S", as... special. Lady special needs, rest is in "as stupid." Alive rattlesnake with a deadly bite. And the rules are, we will put our hands on the table, than the snake will be released. Now, whoever pulls the hands away first, is the loser. Manuel. Is this really necessary? Wouldn't you prefer a nice game of darts? No? Oh, well let's do it then. -Senior. A glass of water. -It's on a house. It might be your last. Be very careful, Ambrose. Be very careful. If necessary, Wilbur eat snake. Don't make it mad. Don't make it mad. The cowboys cheated. They rubbed your glass with the potion, that attract snakes. Whoever tries to hurt Ambrose, will have to deal with me. And with me. -And with me. Hey. Hey, Ambrose. Oh, yeah. Saloon fight not for me. Carry this outside. Who's next? Let's go. Comfortable like this? -Take this. A real gentlemen. -Wilbur? Come on. -I'll be back. Your friend is very strong, isn't he? Let's say, strongest but rough. Just doesn't have finesse. You messing with the best. Asta la vista, baby. Gracias. I'm completely change the formula. This time will work for sure. Just a drop. Damn it, failed again. How is that possible? I think you must move. But I will get it right. Don't you worry. Even if it takes me hundred years. We are not get it at all. Seems, nobody knows about Parasite. And if they do know something, they are afraid to talk to anyone. After yesterday... Good morning. -Good morning. Is this a bad time? -Not at all, miss. Come in. Well, we were discussing the situation in Dark city. Maybe you can help miss... -It's Miss Missy. Beautiful name. Well, Miss Missy, I'm sorry. We have to apologize for our behavior. Wilbur was stupid enough to wreck the saloon and now because of him Miss Missy you're of a job. That's ok, Ambrose. The music industry isn't doing well anyway. With all that downloading and all. -Yeah. As Lucy was saying, maybe you can help us out a little. Maybe you can tell us some more about Jim Parasite. Me? But why I would know more about him? You are a... bar made. You hear things in the saloon. Don't you? Yes, but it's all busy talk. And if they talk to me it's always for the same reason. I can imagine. No, I don't think you can. Come down, aunty. Well, I thought I could help but I guess so just go back to my hotel. It will be my pleasure to escort you to your... hotel miss. -Wilbur will take Missy. I think she has a preference for the more elegant man on the world. -I think so too. Missy not interest it in bald head it wing backs. Well, I least I don't look like Shrek's ugly brother. No. Ambrose don't this ugly brother. Maybe let Missy decide, hm? Well, we will ask her right away then. Well, this really separates the men from the boys. Thanks for walking me back to my room, Luke. That was very sweet. What's with you guys? I think, aunty is on the something. That means Missy could be Parasite accomplice. Oh, come on, Lucy. With eyes like that? Snap out of it, man. Yeah and talking about being suspicious. What about that Sheriff? He's real weirdo. Hides in his office all day refusing to make a stand. No, how can he be? His legs in the cast. Hey, you think, Theodor has any dealing with Parasite? I'm so. I bet he already sold a couple of vacuum cleaners. Yeah, dirt cheap and not expensive. Oh, Luke. There is something weird is going on. Last warning. You leaving Dark city today. All of you. J.P. -Jim Parasite. That was Parasite. Aunty. -Children. Are you all right? Who was that shooting? I'll show them. He was Parasite. He wants us to leave town. Oh, really? What a shame. Well, you know, we're not welcome here. Maybe it's just better if we get out. We are not letting him chase us away, are we aunty? No. We have to make that bully understand we're not afraid. We had to be careful. Ambrose. Wilbur. You two will comb the town. Comb the town, you say? Talk the words right out of my mouth. Street presents. Shown the town, that everything is under control. I think, we should split out. Yes, good plan. We split up. I go left side of town. -Ok. And... and I go the right. Ambrose can choose. Aunty, we'll go tell the Sheriff and let him know, that we saw Jim Parasite. Ok. But remember, be very careful. Yeah, come on in. Is he gone? -Who? Who? Who do you think? Santa Claus. Parasite, of course. -How did you know was him? It must of be him. It's always him. Hey, what kind of Sheriff are you? You heard him shooting yet you do nothing? Listen, little lady. My legs on the cast. I can't do anything. And besides, I... Who I'm kidding? Even without a broken leg, I couldn't do a thing. Nobody can touch Parasite. It's too powerful and way too dangerous. Friends, trust me. Get out of here before will something terrible happens. I'm serious. What are you doing here? I'm a... combing town. Oh, right. But I combed everything here already. Why don't you go comb somewhere else? Better if Wilbur double comb. Well, do you comb this part of town? Well...I...I... I thought you deserve some pretty flowers. Get in here, you dove. I don't trust that Miss Missy not one little bit and I discovered something big. Me too. Not that, you ninny. More like this. What are you doing here? Came to bring flowers. -Yap, me too. And I want to ask you some questions. Where were you the past half hour? I was taking a bath, ok? And now I would like all of you to get out of my room. Right now! Already go. Must forgive friends. Friends no manners. Missy Stuart. Wilbur help drive off. Leave me alone. All of you. There. You hear? Missy want to be alone. That was heavy. I almost fell sorry for poor guy. I don't know. Why is he Sheriff then? He didn't even have a clue who Parasite might even be. I think it's someone from the town. What else he would hide behind the mask. Yeah, you right. Ok. So, who in this town resembles Jim Parasite? Good morning, children. Something tells me you two needs new hats. How would you know? Because yours are already fill with bullet holes. Come on in. Beautiful design, isn't it? A hat to tip your head, I say. Dirt cheap and not expensive. What do you think? Well, it's a hat. Hey, there's something I would like to know. How they clean those hats? It's very simple. With this multi functional vacuum cleaner, which comes with it special head attach. Wait. That's what we need. No way. When it's too easy is not fun. Theodore, I need some cases of that whiskey. Excellent choice. Superb whiskey. I been for my own barley. Great. I'll take ten cases. Need tonight. We're gonna have a party... for Ambrose's birthday. Today is not Ambrose's... Ten cases of whiskey. Ten. Go to see my supplier. I'll be back in one hour. Bye-bye. Ten cases. -So, since when do you buy whiskey? Didn't you notice? They were the same exact cases as Ambrose's. Yeah. -Then you understand why ordered more than he had in stock. Because then he needs to get more and does he get them from? From Parasite. -That's right. Of, course. Yeah, yeah. You're smart. Everybody knows. Ten cases. Hello! Is anybody home? Is anybody here? Stop. -A, there is. Good. I was getting scared. Boss. There's a problem. One thing is for sure. Theodor is not Parasite. Quiet, I wanna hear what Parasite says. Lucy. -Be quiet. Lucy. -What? Hojla. I hope you have a very good reason for coming here. I'm just here to buy whiskey. A lots of whiskey. Will do good business, a? Come on. Andale. Arriva. Is that a new gun? -Yes. Brand new. Nice. And are you happy with it? Si, si. Very happy. It looks very cool. Can I hold it? -No. Here. -For me? Only if I can... -Ok. Oh, for me. Ole. No. No. No. No. No. Stupido. Stupido. Stupido. And who is so thirsty that you have to come here, what you not supposed to be? You will be really surprised. The Rangers. -What? The Rangers? You full. You brought the Rangers here? They'll need a very big vacuum cleaner to clean up what's left of you when I'm done. Help. What a coincidence. All right, just happen to have some in stock. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go after them. Is still hanging on? Yes he is but we're not alone. Slow down. Not so fast. Aunty, help. -Lucy? Aunty, help us. We been pursued by Parasite's gang. Ambrose. Wilbur. Lucy, hold on. They're on their way. Come on, Theodor. -I'll do it. I'll do it. One, two, three. Lucy, give me your hand. My little van. Hey, what is this means? Look out. Oh, no. The bridge. We're too late. Wilbur take care of it. I coming too. Oh, Luke. Please tell me you can stop the train. I can stop the train. -Really? -No. I think that's a steam whistle. There's only one thing left we can do. Oh, it's Wilbur. -Wilbur. My hero. Thanks a lot, Wilbur. -It's all right. Otherwise Wilbur blush. I got it on the control. They want more? That it's what will they get. So, were doing business with Parasite. How could you? -I'm just a small time shop owner, who ester on a living. -What business is slow when a customer is a customer. -Aunt Cybil, I knew you not understand. -That's nonsense. You knew that Parasite was a bandit and yet you did nothing to help the Rangers. We have to go back to the mine. I believed that Rangers has been held hostage there. By now Parasite has long gone or hide in one of the many tunnels. Then we will look for him there. -No, no. no. There are no road signs, you know. Miles and miles of tunnels full of holes and traps... This is Ambrose, but you can call me Mr. Ambrose. This is Jim Parasite. Jim Parasite? What a coincidence that you call. We just talking about you. How are you? How is the family? It's Jim Parasite. Hands up! Don't move a muscle. You imbecile. I wanna talk with your leader. I've a proposition. -Really? Yes. Well, that's me. Yes. -What yes, yes? Really? Where? And when? Excellent. Yes, of course. I'll be there. Ok. See you later. Bye Jim. Voila. Well, that's taken care of. What's taken care of? -Well, that J.P. certainly isn't stupid. I mean, he is able to recognize a real leader. Hold me back or I'll wrap the real leader's neck. What's taken care of? Well, J.P. actually challenge me to a duel to finally set all this business once and for all and of course, I accept it. Have you lost your mind, Ambrose? Lost my mind? I'll just teach that pretender who is boss and case closed. -But Ambrose, don't you know Parasite is a crack shot? -And I'm not? Do you see Wilbur's hat hanging there? Yeah. That was off by a mile. I...Yes well, that's because a... I notice just in time, there was my hat. Look. Will you shut him, you idiots. Got you. For me. No. Come on. -For me. For me. For me. Strike. And it's nonstick. Don't run away now. -No, no. no. no. -OK. It's Missy's room. Surprise. Where's Wilbur? Wasn't he with you? No. I haven't seen him. And where is Parasite? That coward. -Come. Let's puts these stags behind bars first. And where was that Sheriff? Sheriff? What happened? I was... you know...just get ready to come watch duel. I mean, come help you... and all of sudden Parasite was here and lock me in the cell. Well, the good news is we round up the Parasite's entire gang. -The whole gang? Well, we haven't got a Parasite himself yet, but that's just a matter of time. -And the meantime, here are the others. If you could just guard them, when we'll finish our job? We would be really grateful. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Of course. You can count on me. I'm your man. -Hey, Sheriff. Now, please listen to me carefully. Do not let them go. We haven't got a clue who might be. The Sheriff didn't do in, the Theodor didn't do in... Is not me either or I would arrested myself a long time ago. I'm afraid I have some bad news. Jim Parasite is captured your friend Wilbur. Leave Dark city before sundown or you never see your friend Wilbur again. Jim Parasite. -Impossible. How could Parasite possibly bit our guy? No way. Yeah. -I'm afraid it's true. If that monster even durst only a finger on Wilbur I... What we gonna do now? We can't just leave, can we? I know it's hard to leave but you can't put Wilbur's life on a line. I don't want to admit it but Missy is right. But aunty... -There's no other way. We have to leave. -Wilbur. Don't tell me you're leaving. Are you serious? I hate this is loyal customers leave. Say this isn't true. What's the point of all? Theodore, it is something you can do for us. Really? I...well...I have a secrium. I'll sent Wilbur home, when I'll catch Parasite. That's very unsure, Sheriff. I'm so sorry, Ambrose. But I promise I'll do anything in my power to find your friend. The law doesn't seem to be that tough after all. Wait to friends get here. -Friends? You don't have any, little man. Luke and Lucy are leaving, leaving you here to rot. Liar. They wouldn't leave without Wilbur. -No? Watch carefully, little man. It's show time. But is shame. They're gone. I can't believe it. -Looser. Nobody. They leave you here to rot. It's so typical. I would never know any different, even as a child. But then I swore. Nobody will humiliate me anymore. Soon, boom! And then, I will be the greatest king of the world. King craziest. Theodore, oh, boy. What got yourself into to now? Stay calm. Stay calm. Deep breaths. Our father in the lighting heaven I will be done. Save us from taxes and while your addit for competition as well. Why not? Listen, doc. I don't wanna press on you, but I really hope this will work this time. This time I'll add a bit of Flesh Extra. What Flesh Extra? Flesh Extra is a laundry detergent but not just any laundry detergent. NASA developed to me the astronauts laundry shruf proof. I made the anti-shrinking powder one hundred times stronger. It should be story to your previous dimension if not more. Whatever, doc. Just pour it. Ready? All right, doc. You did it, man. Great. I don't know how to thank you. Oh, well, it was a piece of cake. Ok, guys. The coast is clear. A fantastic plan, children. Did he really think we run off? It's time for faced to Jim. Cut it out, Betty. Come on, get off from me. Be quiet, girl. Miss... What's wrong with you? -Well, Mr. smooth Casanova, did you ever think to wonder where she might be going this late at night?
