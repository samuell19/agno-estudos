[MUSIC PLAYING] NARRATOR: Yes, there it it, Locharne Castle, the Earl of Locharne's uncomfortable seat. The Earl and the castle have more in common than the name-- the moat is overgrown, and the Earl is overdrawn; the pipes, like the Earl, are bust; in the olden days, the neighboring clansmen may have attacked with claymores, but nowadays, it's the neighboring tradesmen who attack with ritz. -Where's the Earl? -Oh, you're unlucky. He's not here today. -Maybe now, but we're here to see him just the same. -You can't come barging in here like the wind up our gully. -That's enough from you. We're here to see the Earl. -But-- -And we're not leaving until we get our money. -As soon as he comes back, I'll get him to send you a check. -Which the bank will also send back. This time, it's cash we want. -It's near on three years since I've had a penny [INAUDIBLE] for the past six. And all that time, he's had the brass neck to expect me to keep him supplied with all the whiskey he wants. -Don't lean on that chair. It's got a shookley leg. -Unless he settles today, we'll put the bailiffs in. [CLATTER] -You mean to say you'd have him turned out of his own castle? -You mean his creditor's castle. -Hah, for what it's worth. -We'll be well rid of him. -Hah. -I'd like to kick him from here to England. -He's too bad even for England. -What base talk is this? You traitors. -Traitors? -Traitors. Fools and idiots. John Gilroy Locharne, 19th Earl, of whom you speak so treacherously, is the rightful King of Scotland by direct lineal descent. And you miserable creatures come here to threaten him and to plot against him. -We've only come for our money. -You would betray him for gold. Renegades. May the blood of [INAUDIBLE] pour down on your heads. Be gone. Be off. [INAUDIBLE] before I lay you low. -Well done, Miss Nicholson. -I only did my duty as one of your royal subjects to be. -And very effectively. A message to remember, Menzies. -For many years now, I've delved deeply into the archives of Scotland. It has been my life's work. At last, I'm poised on the brink of success. 'Ere long now, to the triumphant sound of silver trumpets. With you at the head of an avenue of banners on a black charger, I shall proudly witness the ceremony when you are proclaimed sovereign. -Yes, well at the moment, I'd settle for half a sovereign. Menzies, get a step ladder, a hammer, and nails round to the front door right away, will you? -OK. -If you will give me an audience after breakfast, I'll bring you genealogical charts which will incontestably prove-- -You're wasting your time, Madam. Please just agree that my mission in life shall be that of a rural boarding house landlady. -Boss, these signs I paged the other day, they've got to go out now. We've got to get some money from somewhere, somehow. Paying guests is not enough. -Well, the first thing is to find more ways of economizing. Menzies will have to go. -Well, it'll mean a lot more extra work for you, doesn't it? -It'll save me running around after him to make sure he's done his work. -You're a remarkable woman, Boss. Don't know what I'd do without you. MISS NICHOLSON (OFFSCREEN): When do I get my breakfast? -Coming. MISS NICHOLSON (OFFSCREEN): Oh come along, I'm hungry. What's the cereal? Crispy Flakes or Toasty Wheats? -Corny Crunch. -You know, I never touch Corny Crunch. Does things to my-- Change it. -Now, this is where we reach an all-time low. -It's [INAUDIBLE] today, sir. I was wondering would you want anything on? I hear [INAUDIBLE] cans are snipped for the 230. -No thanks. Your last snip went down but it was my money you lost. Menzies, you haven't got such a thing as a smoke, have you? How do you manage to afford such expensive cigarettes? -Well, I can't, but your lodger Mr. Blair can. Take a fistful. -No, I can't, Menzies. -But go on. There's plenty more where these come from. -You know, I have a feeling we're going to miss you, Menzies. -Miss me? -And I understand Dr. Anderson has offered you a job. -Uh huh. -Four pounds a week. -Four ten, and my stamps. -Much more than you get here. -I know. -And you get it, which is more than you do here. -I know. -Well, you're going to take it, aren't you? -Here, are you trying to give me my notice? -Yes. -Well just you stop that. I don't like it. -Oh Menzies, come and take out Miss Nicholson's tray. In my present mood, she's the one who's going to get crowned. -OK. -Oh Menzies, if the old hag wants to see me, tell her I plead the Catering Wages Act, will you? -Oh Menzies, I'm terribly sorry about this, but Saturday week. -What's on then? -You're leaving. -Oh, [INAUDIBLE] I wish you'd all stop gnatting on about me leaving. I've just told the Earl I'm fine where I am. -You know as well as I do, the earl can't afford you. -I also know he can't afford to buy the stamps to bring my card up to date. And supposing I do go. [INAUDIBLE] and who would cook? -Oh we'd cope. -Well, [INAUDIBLE] coming in for three hours twice a week when just you expect him. A fat lot of coping it would be. -Good morning, Mrs. Thompson. -They ought to put out a statue to that woman. -Oh? Why? -She never talks. -Menzies, you know the situation as well as I do. I honestly don't think you can stay. -Are there no more lodges booked? -I wish you wouldn't call them lodges. They are lodges, but there's no need to call them lodges. No, there aren't. -Well here, let's get this straight. Four lodges at 10 guineas a week, now that's 42 quid a week. -Do you realize what it costs the Earl to run this place? He pays out more than that in wages alone. -You interest me. -Why? Didn't you get yours last week? -No. -The week before? -The week before you might call a gesture. Two pounds of a count on a Friday. -Well that's something. -He borrowed three from me on the Saturday. -Well that's why you should stop being so big-headed and go and work for Dr.Anderson. -I've told you, I'm fine where I am. -It's coming to do a pretty pass in this country when an employee refuses to accept notice when it's given to him. -When it comes to that, why do you not clear out yourself? [SINGS] -Things certainly are grim. -Well the great thing is not to lose our sense of humor. -Oh, Miss Trent, I'd like to speak to you for a moment. Oh, Miss Trent, I'm sorry, but it's that cistern. I haven't got a wink of sleep since I came here. When it's not going rumble, rumble, rumble, it's going poggle, poggle, poggle the whole night. -And how do you expect it to go? Tan tivvy, tan tivvy, tan tivvy? -If you can have my bill by lunchtime, I'll be catching the afternoon train. -Miss Miller complaining about the cistern. -What about it? -It rumbled. -Fair enough, so does Miss Miller. -She said she's leaving today. -There goes 10 guineas. -Oh, come in. Oh, put it down somewhere. Not on the charts. Mind the tree. Is this haddock? -Egg. What's this? -It's a genealogical tree. -A what? -A genealogical tree. Now look, you'll see it has its roots in antiquity. -OK, don't bother. I can see it'd take a long time to explain. What's that hole in it? -Well, that [INAUDIBLE] where an entire branch was chopped off at some time. -During the fuel cuts [INAUDIBLE]? -Nevertheless, intensive collateral research has indicated that whatever happened to that branch, it never flourished. When this parchment is revealed, it will launch the greatest [INAUDIBLE] in Scottish history. For because of what it proves, your master will soon be enthroned in Holyrood as King John. -With things going the way they are, he'll soon be enthroned at Aberdeen Jail, as convict 99. -Hey, Locharne. Where's Locharne? -The Earl is at breakfast. -He was outside just now. I saw him. -Is there anything I can do? -My sheets are damp. -They were dry enough when I put them on. -Argh. Now Locharne, I want a word with you. -Now look, Mr. Blair, I don't mind making polite conversation with the lodges at feeding time. -I'm not here to make polite conversation. -I don't even mind playing clock golf with you despite the fact that you develop a hacking cough whenever your opponent is about to putt. -What? What's that? -But as far as the guests are concerned, there is one room that's out of bounds, and this is it. Even the landlady is entitled to her quiet moments. -As far as I'm concerned, you can have an eternity of quiet moments. I'm leaving on the afternoon train. -Good morning. [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] I'd have been all right, but I-- thank you-- [MUTTERING] -Bang goes another 10 guineas, not to mention the cigarettes. Thank you, Boss. What? No egg? -No egg. -Aren't we laying? -In company with Miss Nicholson, Miss Miller, Mrs. Thompson, and Mr. Blair, the hens are feeling the cold. -Well, they've got fires in their rooms, haven't they? They're lodges, [INAUDIBLE] them in fact, they said therefore since the first round of matches connector text I believe you pay close attention to I also the failure -Now just you stop that. -Of course you'll receive adequate compensation. -There's a party to be showing round, sir. About 30 bob's worth. -Just a minute, Menzies. Excuse me one moment, Mr. Phillips, will you? -Welcome, ladies and gentleman to Locharne castle. Around which it will be my pleasure to conduct you at your own risk. Charge is two and six a head, which I shall now collect, will go towards providing my father, the 18th earl, a more comfortable grave in which to turn. -Hah, hah, hah. -Half price only on Fridays. -You might like to join the party that's being shown over the castle. -Thank you, I'd like that better. -Thank you. -Oh, Mr. Phillips would like to one of the party. -Oh, I'm sure he'll be life and soul of it. Half a crown, please. -Half a crown? -For the earls' welfare. -All goes down to expenses. -Did you make it yourself? We're now in the great hall. The portraits you see on the wall are those of my ancestors. And the one on the extreme left here is the third earl. And judging by the amount of loot he brought back home, he was one of the most successful crusaders ever to be posted overseas. [BELL RINGING] -Yes. I'm Mrs. Dunne. -Dunne? -Right. -Not Mrs. J Clodfelter Dunne? -Quite. -Of Denver, Colorado? -Right again. Can I come in? -Why certainly. -OK for the chauffeur to bring in the baggage? -Yes. Yes, of course. -It's a long time since we heard from you. -I decided to stop writing to you about the castle and come and see it for myself. -You're still thinking of buying it then. -That's why I'm here. -Is the earl around? -The earl-- I'll just go and see. Make yourself comfortable. -Well take your time. Oh. Are you a-- a relation? -No, I'm employed here. -Oh. One of the hired help. -That's right -That's the 14th earl. One of the staunchest supporters of an [INAUDIBLE] Prince Charlie. -Looks like David Niven to me. -Isn't it perishing cold in this place? --Compared with Locharne, for comfort and convenience the average jail is a palace. -Well, well, well. Do you wish to join the party? -Delighted. -Come along up, will you? -Make way, ladies and gentlemen. My dear lady. Come along, everybody. This way. American? -Right. -Good show. Excuse me one moment. Now are we all here? Good. Now the first thing that will strike you about Locharne castle is the appalling state of disrepair the place has fallen into. And this is due not only to the ravages of time, but also to my forebears' fondness for wine and what goes with it. Not to mention the insatiable demands of the tax collectors. Dry rot about. You see that, Mr. Phillips? All the ceilings are liable to fall in at any moment. Take a look at this one here. -Easily put right. -That's what you think. You should see the report of the architect I called in recently. So sorry, Mr. Phillips, but you've been warned. -I know an American. -You don't say? -I don't exactly know her. We've been corresponding. Her name's Dunne. -Is that so? -Yes, Mrs. J. Clodfelter Dunne. Imagine going through life with a name like Clodfelter. -Imagine. -And she claims to be a descendant of my family, which proves that she's a crackpot. We'll go this way. -You don't know what she looks like? -Oh, well preserved, '60s, blue-rinse, outside bust, shops by post at Macy's. This way. Ermyntrude? Ermyntrude? Are you there? [GHOST SOUNDS] -Oh good. Now listen. The earl's in terrible trouble. But if you respond to him as you were of his grandfather, but you can help, eh? [GHOST SOUNDS] -Oooh, goody goody. -Now behind this wall is a sealed-up dungeon where Alexander the [INAUDIBLE] had his wife's tongue cut out. I understand he lived happily ever after. [INAUDIBLE] -Now you can't mistake the goat. He's got striped trousers, a face like a rabbit, and the air of a man who's drunk with power. [GHOST SOUNDS] -Now most castles host a haunted room. Well, this one is haunted all over. Well, I have a room where, she so to speak, hangs out. -Ooh, I wouldn't like to be here after dark. -Yes, well actually our ghost works a 24 hour day. -Do you mean to say you can see it in the day time? -Oh yes. She hasn't been unionized yet. Poor thing. Hah, hah, hah. -What's this? -You that's been in the family since 1696-- to 1952. Now, Phillips, I want you to look at the ceiling here. I think you'll find this exhilarating. Poor old Phillips, I'm so sorry, but you seem determined to learn the hard way that you're wasting your time with Locharne. [GHOST SOUNDS] -Sorry to disturb you, Ermyntrude, but needs must, you know. You going to faint? -I guess not. -Pity. -Let's get out of here. -On the double. -Women and children first. -Straight ahead, ladies and gentlemen. Mind how you go. [THUD] -Ow! [GROANING] -Thank you, Ermyntrude. You've done splendidly. -And so we say farewell to ancient Locharne as the noon day sun flags its historic walls with gold. Rather good, don't you think? That reminds me. Gratuities of service greatly received. -Look! -A mouse! -Oh, yes. The place is infested with them. [SCREAMING] -Well, now Mr. Phillips, I take it you'll be catching the 3:30? -Not at all. -You're not still thinking of requisitioning Locharne are you? -Certainly. -But my dear misguided old coal merchant, you've seen the state the place is in. Why the only thing that's holding it up is the ivy. -It can soon be put right. -I beg of you, Mr. Phillips. Please think of the miners' welfare. You don't want to see Locharne in the winter. It's very cold. [GHOST SOUNDS] -Do you know it's so cold that she haunts in a muffler? -Nevertheless, I've quite decided to remain here for a day or two. -The terms are 15 guineas a week. -50 all right. All goes down to expenses. -No wonder coal's the price it is. Menzies? -Sir? -Show this gentleman into the MacDuff room, will you? -Is that the room that's supposed to be haunted? -Not yet. -This way, sir. -Well, well. I thought you too had fled from the mice. -Me? Run from mice? -You're not in a hurry I hope. -No. I can afford to spend as much time as I need. Who's he? -Ninth earl, hanged for sheep-stealing. -And him? -Hamish, the fifth earl, killed in the lowlands. -By the enemy? -No, a drink. That reminds me. What about a little drink and a chat in the library, eh? -I have a room ready for you, if you'd like to come and register, Mrs. Dunne. -I'll be right with you. -Dunne? -Mm-hm. -Mrs. Dunne? -Why, yes. In full Mrs. James Clodfelter Dunne. -Mrs. Dunne wants some iced water. -Ach, these foreigners. They're all the same with their fancy carry-ons. Besides, we haven't got any. -Hold your goat now. There was an inch to a half ice in the horse trough this morning. Go and get it with your toe. -I'll take a coffee up if it's ready. [BELL RINGING] -OK, it's [INAUDIBLE]. -Oh, Menzies, fill the vases, will you? The laird ordered flowers. -I've lit a fire in her room. And MacGregor's taking up some more logs. -Good. -It'll have to be salmon for dinner. -The salmon fishing season's over. -There's no need to be technical, Jesse. [BELL RINGING] [WIND BLOWING] [SHIVERING] [MUMBLING] [BELL RINGING] -It's her? -I'll see what she wants. -Don't worry. I'll go. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] -In. By earl, I didn't mean you should come yourself. -For me? -No, the valet. And these. -Thank you. -Well, I guess that's all right now. There is a valet, isn't there? -Well it's the same man who does the silver actually. -I guess the help you need to run an outfit this must take some finding. -Yes, I doubt you'd find them if you searched the entire building. I say. That's very pretty. -Sapphires and diamonds. -Really? I do hope you're going to be comfortable here. -Well, thanks. I just hope that four poster doesn't give me nightmares though. I had enough of them when I was with Jimmy. -Jimmy? -My ex-husband. -Ex? -Yeah. I divorced him a couple of years ago. He got a little tired of my Scottish ancestors. He said my family went back no further than some Latter-day saints in Utah. But then, he never had an appreciation for the romantic. -So you find Locharne romantic, eh? -Very. -Well, perhaps you'd like me to show you around after lunch. -I'd love it. -We might even take a gun out. Do you do any shooting in Colorado? -Mostly craps. -Good show. -You know, you're not a bit like I expected. -Oh really? --No. I thought you've be about 80 with a purple face and a big white moustache. Are you married? -Good heavens no. -You surprise me. -Well I can't even keep my-- I'll probably have a crack at it one day I suppose. -We'll have a drink to that before lunch. Shall we? -Splendid. Yes, Splendid. -When do we raise the standard? -Of what? -The Jacobite standard. Rally the clan! [INAUDIBLE] Light the fiery cross ablaze from [INAUDIBLE] to [INAUDIBLE]. I feel a positive reincarnation of [INAUDIBLE]. What's for lunch? -Mince. -Oh. Now no turning back. Remember the 45. Press on! -I'm about to do so. -Since when have you been a lady's maid? -Since the arrival a lady from America who may buy Locharne. She's gonna get service. God bless America, and especially martial aid. I tell you, boss. If Mrs. J. Clodfelter does the deal, then rot old man Phillips and the entire coal board. -Aren't you going to find it a little awkward having them both here at the same time? -Why? -Well correct me if I'm wrong, but you've been giving Mr. Phillips the impression that Locharne's practically unfit for human habitation. Now you want to convince Mrs. Dunne it's the castle of her dreams. -You leave that to me. I don't think Phillips will be with us very long. [WIND HOWLING] -Ow. -Tell me boss. How do I press these? Up the front or down the seams? -I shouldn't be too sure about Mr. Phillips. -You wait. One night in the MacDuff room and he'll be asking what time the milk train leaves in the morning. Why that room hasn't been slept in since Queen Victoria came over for a good laugh at the west wing. -If you're going to keep up the pretense of running the regent palace of the northeast you're going to look mighty short of guests. Especially now that Mr. Blair and Ms. Miller have gone. -Don't you be so sure they have gone. -Well they left to catch the 3:30 from Aberdeen. -But it doesn't necessarily follow that they're going to catch it, does it? -Where's that [INAUDIBLE] of Locharne? -I'll fetch your bags in for you. Thanks, [INAUDIBLE]. -Hey, Locharne! Locharne! -Now what? --Where the-- where the blazes are you? -Oh. I thought you were catching the afternoon train. -Well so did we. The car broke down. Just gave up the ghost. [INAUDIBLE] had to tow us back. -I have an idea that this is a put-up job. -I thought I'd escaped from that dreadful system. -Menzies, the system. -Don't follow me, madam. I'm going to have a good swear. And when I start, I can go on for 20 minutes without repeating myself. -Well done, Menzies. Remind me to pay your some of the money I owe you. -We'll be needing a salmon for the night, Menzies. -Yes, well what about taking Mr. Phillips with you, eh? -What would I want to take him for? -I thought you might drop him in the drink. -What do you shoot around here? -My neighbor's grouse and creditors if they come in range. [DOG BARKING] -Tell me, this Mr. Phillips, is he really after Locharne? -I'm afraid so. -I just can't see him as a great bug Scottish laird. -Well, it's not for himself. He's actually on behalf of a-- a concern. -Oh, what sort of a concern? Business people? -Not exactly. They're in coal, you know. -They own mines? -They do now. -Can they afford a place like Locharne? -Oh yes, ever since they discovered a way of painting slate black, they've made a fortune. [GUN SHOTS] -I guess they took evasive action. -Oh no, you haven't reloaded. -Which hole do you put them in? -Allow me, will you? [GUN SHOTS] -Well gee, I didn't hurt them, did I? -What relation are you to Annie Oakley? -I'm not. But my ex-husband once worked in Chicago. -He did? -That was before he became the Dunn of Dunn's Denver Delicatessen. My ex-husband controls the largest chain of delicatessen stores in the south. Or did. -Did? -Well, I have a 51% holding. -Is this a nice size to have, don't you think? -Mm, I find it so. He gave me 20% when we got engaged. Another 20% as a wedding present. And my attorney settled for 11% along with the alimony when we got divorced. He was so mad when he added it up and finally came to 51, he wouldn't even attend the board meeting. Arithmetic never was Jimmy's strong suit. -So you really are very rich. -Well, I think I'll be able to put in a bid against Mr. Phillips and his concern. -Do you mind? I'll go and help the dogs. -OK. You do that. -Hey, you, Locharne. -Hello, Major. -What the devil do you think you're doing, eh? -Well, I-- -I've told you before, this is private property. -Just having a little walk through, you know? -Well, you keep to your own blasted estate, or what's left of it. And I'll keep to mine. [GUN SHOT] What was that? -Uh, I didn't hear anything. [GUN SHOT] -Maybe you heard that? -Eh, perhaps it's a little backfiring on the road, Major. MISS DUNNE (OFFSCREEN): Earl. -Er, nice to see you, mate. -Earl, you never told me Locharne was an aviary. You just can't miss. -Run. -What? -Run. -Well, you darn. And if I catch that fellow Menzies on my stretch of the river again, I'll have a [INAUDIBLE] -What a waste. -Blast. [INAUDIBLE] Look. -But I thought-- -Shh. -But I thought one used the rod. -Some folk might. -Oh, there's your supper. -Steady. -Hey. -Run. -I beg your pardon? Run, you gowk. -Put down that fish, you damn scoundrel. -Are you addressing me, my good man? [GUN SHOT] -Wait. Come back here. [INAUDIBLE] I'll cover your backside for you. [GUN SHOT] [GUN SHOT] -Fine day, constable. -Hi. That's a bonny fish you've got there. -What's that? -I said that's a bonny fish you've got there. -Oh this? Oh yes, yes, extremely bonny. -All right, it'll be about an 18-pounder. -As much as that? -Oh, why, it'll grow all of 18 pounds. -Yes, I-- I [INAUDIBLE] constable. -What did you catch him with? -What's that? -I said what did you catch him with? -This thing here. [INAUDIBLE] it goes, really. -Name? -Don't worry, Phillips, old chap. You leave the whole thing to me. I'm on the bench. You'll probably only get seven days. -Seven days? [SNEEZE] -Bless you. Well, here's mud in your eye. -Thank you. I've got [INAUDIBLE] on my trousers. -Now look. You nip upstairs and have a nice hot bath before dinner. -I'd like to have our business discussion as soon as possible. -Later, later. You wouldn't like dinner served in your room, would you? Be no trouble to have it sent over. -And what would you use? A St. Bernard? [SNEEZES] -Bless you. Menzies. Charge Phillips up with a half a bottle of beer, will you? By the way, you play the pipes, don't you? -Oh, well I wouldn't go so far as to say-- -Mrs. Dunne was telling me that she's looking forward to the real Highland atmosphere at dinner. You know. Pipers playing and so on. -But I haven't played since I was in the boys' brigade. -Well, you've got between now and 7:30 to brush up on Locharne's Lament and make it good, will you? Well now, Mrs. Dunne. Hello, Mrs. Dunne. You've seen all over the estate. What do you think of Locharne? -I think it stinks. Well, I guess something could be done with it. But you had me a little worried by what you said about the dry rot this morning. -No, no. That was for Phillips' benefit. With the possible exception of Ms. Miller, there isn't a single piece of dry rot in the place. Beat it. -What? -Nothing. No. -And those drains you spoke about? -I assure you. The drains are perfectly all right. They were put in by the same people who put the drains in at Balmoral. You've never heard of them having trouble with the drains over there, have you? -I guess not. Hello there. -Had a nice walk. -We ran most of the way. -Nothing happened while you've been away, boss. -Not a thing. Apart from cleaning the silver that you left and washing up the lunch things, helping Ms. Miller with her crossword puzzle, and listening to Ms. Nicholson's plans for you to fight Bannockburn all over again, fending off infuriated tradesmen, and trying to squeeze this putting course. I found time lying heavily on my hands. -Never mind, boss. We've got plenty of grass for dinner. -In that case, will you excuse me? I shall have to start plucking. -She's crazy about you, isn't she? -Who? Boss? Good heavens no. -She is. Why not marry the gal? If it doesn't work out, you can always do what I did. -What did you do? -Went to Reno and sued for mental cruelty. Said my husband whistled in bed. -And did he? -That was my story and I stuck to it. -Yes. well over here we stress the moral rather than the musical side. -[INAUDIBLE] Sire. -I wish you wouldn't keep bobbing up and down like a yo-yo. Ms. Nicholson you haven't met Mrs. Dunne. -Oh, how do you do? -How do you do? -One of the [INAUDIBLE] Dunnes? -No. -Ms. Nicholson is absolutely convinced that I'm the rightful king of Scotland. -And so you are. -She'll probably find that you're directly descended from Robert the Bruce. -On his father's side, I guess. -Oh, so you're a student of Scottish history? How interesting. I've given my life to it. As a girl, I had a momentous decision to make-- should my career by mountaineering, falconry or history? I was equally proficient in all three subjects, but I chose history, which was fortunate indeed, sire, for you-- -Oh, indeed. -For Scotland. -And my ancestors were Scottish. -Were they really now? -Sure. Way back, they were Locharnes. -Which side? The Locharne Locharnes or the [INAUDIBLE] Locharnes? -I wouldn't know. One of them was accused of being a traitor to the Jacobite cause. -Oh, Mrs. Dunne, Jacobite. -Anyway, he escaped to New England dressed up as a chambermaid. He was supposed to have murdered a nun in Inverness. -It was the non-conformist branch of the family, obviously. -That that's probably Black Locharne, 1706- 1772. He was the sole issue of the 12th earl and Janet Kenfinnen. On the wrong side of the bank. -No need to go into all that, is there? -Oh but it's absorbingly interesting. We must look you up in the family album. -I wish you would. I have a special reason for wanting to be sure I really am a Locharne. -Ah, you leave that to me. If I haven't your lineal ancestry traced back to the reign of king Malcolm the first before dinner, my name isn't Veronica [INAUDIBLE] Nicholson. -It isn't? -Certainly. What's for dinner? -The salmon. -Boiled or grilled? -Poached. -Before anyone starts paying homage, would you mind paying a little attention to the Brussels sprouts? I'm going to have to change. [WIND HOWLING] -Oh. [BUMP] -Oh.

She's [INAUDIBLE] above you, as the breeze whispers I love you, when you're plucking petals from a daisy and dreams are crazy, there goes your heart. And when you're frolicking head over heels, the thrill it would be, how lovely it feels. And then you find you're singing a song, and swinging along in a dream. for love changes the weather, when love brings you together, and you never find yourself complaining, because it's raining heaven's above. There goes your heart and you're in love. -Hi. How's the jailbird? -I'm looking for Locharne. -This is it. -I mean the earl. -Oh, he was in the bathroom. -Having a bath? -I wouldn't care to commit myself on that. He was in the bathroom. He was singing and I heard splashing. I've no definite proof but it also seems to add up. -I ask because I wish to inquire about the hot water. -What about it? -There isn't any. -Oh? Menzies boiled some kettles to take the chill off mine. -It isn't a question of taking the chill off. There is none. -Why couldn't find you find a bathroom? A bathroom? -Well I found a room with a bath in it. -Well, I'm sorry I couldn't find any water. But I bet you could use a drink. Do you think if you rang that bell, someone would bring us one? -I doubt it. -Quite a place, isn't it? -Certainly is. -My ex-husband was right. He always said I was a sucker for the romantic. -You find Locharne romantic do you? -I think he's a honey. -This time I was referring to the castle. -What's that? -A bell. -What are you doing with it? -It came away. -Mr. Phillips you just don't know your own strength. -Nonsense. The whole place is falling to pieces. -But the earl told me you were thinking of taking it. -I am. -Is that so? -Why are you? -Yup. -Really? -Of course the place needs a lot of money spent on it. I'd say around a quarter of a million dollars. -It would be immoral to spend anything like a quarter of a million dollars on this property for the benefit of one individual. -You a socialist? -Yes, I am. -I'm sorry, I had no idea. You looks so respectable. -Good evening, Mrs. Dunne. -Good evening. -Who's been mucking about with the ornaments? -Oh, I have, I'm afraid. -Oh, that's all right then. Could you go a wee dram, Mrs. Dunne? -Wiser good, Menzies, thanks. -What's that? -Bell. -And what are you doing with the bell? -Came away. -Well, I'll be charging you bill, mind? Now, Mrs. Dunne, gin and French or scotch? I recommend the scotch. -Why? -The French is British. -Then I'll have scotch. A small one, please, Menzies. What's the matter? -If all these Atlantic pacts are to go through, you yanks will have to learn to speak the king's English. And Menzies is pronounced "Mingis." -Why? -Well, don't ask me. It just is. -In that case, why aren't McKenzies pronounced McKingies? -Menzies, Mr. Phillips is having a little trouble with his bath. -Did you not get your towel? -Yes, thank you very much. But up till now it hasn't been much use. -Why not? -There's not hot water. -Oh no. You see if somebody's having a bath on yon side of the castle, the water doesn't run over your way. -I think Mr. Phillips would like a drink, please, Menzies. -Gin and French. And I'd like a little whiskey if you don't mine, mind. -Don't drown it. Thank you. -Will you pay for it now, or will it put done on your bill? -What on earth's that thing? -It's a claymore. I'm taking with me to Aberdeen to show the Jacobites. It was used by the ninth earl at the battle of Sherriffmuir. Perhaps, who knows, while Rob Roy was changing his bricks. And used, judging by the state of the blade, to considerable effect. Look. -Don't be daft. That wasn't the ninth earl. That's Jesse. She uses it twice a week to chop sticks. Gin and French? -Yes, please. -Mrs. Dunne, great news. The connecting link between Locharne Locharnes and the American limb of the clan is as plain as the node on Mr. Phillips's face. Plainer. -You mean I am a Locharne? -Incontestably. I've got the whole thing here. I'll show you at dinner. Thanks. Slainte! -Slainte. -I understand that you represent the government department. -The coal board, madam. -And that your activities extend to Scotland. -Oh yes. Indeed. -Well, they won't very much longer. -My! -Anything wrong. -Why no. It's just that you look like a million dollars. -Yes, well at the moment I prefer to look half a million dollars, but thanks all the same. -What's that you've got? -Family album. Before becoming one of the family, I thought you'd want to see what we look like. -I am one of the family. Ms. Nicholson's just checked up on me. -Yes, with one look at this rogues gallery you'll probably want to keep it quiet. -Shall we sit? -If I can. Haven't worn this one since the Braemar gathering of 1939. -That's you. -How do you know? -It's very like you. -What? You've never seen me lying stark naked on a bearskin rug. [GASP] -John 18-- 1800 what? -1800 and nothing. 18 months. My age when the picture was taken. -John. You know, I like the name John. -What's yours? -Imelda. -Imelda? Charming. -Oh, are you having a good laugh at the relics? Did you see that picture there with Ms. Trent winning the three-legged race at barrister sports? That's the best one in the whole book. I took it myself. -You know, I can't get over a nice guy like you not being married. -Bothers you, does it? -Well, it sure does. What a waste of manpower. -Anything to please you, Imelda, I'll start looking around. -Well, you don't have far to look, surely. -I just heard something very interesting about the Russian. -What a beautiful dress. -Do you like it? -Oh, I think it's wonderful. I saw one just like it in a fashion magazine before I left home. Was it Dior? -No. Quite inexpensive. -A little woman in the village ran it up for me. You've been browsing through the relics? -Yes. I was just about to tell John when you came in. -Tell whom? -The earl. -Oh? -I've finally decided. I'm going to buy Locharne. -What? -I'm going to buy Locharne. [GONG BEING RUNG] -Dinner. -Thank you, Menzies. Oh and Mr. Blair, will you take Ms. Nicholson and Ms. Miller in please? [INAUDIBLE] Oh, never mind. -And boss, would you take in Mr. Phillips? -Certainly. You're taking in Mrs. Dunne, are you? -Ah, Mrs. Thompson, you haven't met Mrs. Dunne-- -Happy to know you. -And Mr. Phillips. How are you this evening? -Very sad about Mrs. Thompson. She hasn't said a word since her parrot died. -We say grace. -Oh. So sorry. Beg your pardon. -Please, Menzies. -Some here meet, and cannae eat. And some would eat, but want it. But we here meet, and we can eat, and say the lord, bethank it. -That's cute. -That's rather Dunne's, ma'am. -Thank you, Menzies. -OK, you can start now. -If you dish out that salmon before I'm through with Locharne's lament, I'll melt you. -Oh, see clash my cleaver on a carry-on. -Hey, who's the dirty old viking? -That's my father. -Oh. -What's that he's holding in his lap? A Pekingese? -No, that's his sporran. Very comforting in cold weather. [BAGPIPES PLAYING] -Locharne's Lament. A tune that never fails to make my flesh tingle. Don't you agree, Mr. Phillips? -My flesh has been tingling ever since I arrived here. May I offer you the-- [GASP] -Do you mean you keep a piper especially to play at dinner? -Oh, that's nothing. My father, the dirty old viking, used to have the Aberdeen Philharmonic up there on special occasions. They must have played for love. [BAGPIPE RECORD SKIPPING] -Did you not get the cucumber? -No, I did not. Cucumber indeed. You'd think the moderator of the church of Scotland were here for his dinner. -Another crack like that and you'll no be here to see the end of this banquet. -Oh, away. -And now Mrs. Dunne, your ancestry. -You mind, Mr. Blair? -Yeah, but the chart's in the butter. -Thank you. Now here we are. Hamish Locharne of Locharne, 1712- 1768, that did flee the wroth of the Jacobites, and after many bloody-- many bonne fetes -What are bonne fetes? -Rough houses. Took shippy for the Americas and there abode. God rest his soul. That's a boy. Took shippy for the Americas. -What about the other brother? -Yes, the one who broke into a girls' boarding school. -They're all here, plain as a pikestaff. Angus Locharne of Locharne. He was of course Locharne the Black that did commit bloody murder in Inverness, and escaped the gallows in the petticoats of a common-- -Very interesting. Go on. Go on. -And did join with the brother Hamish and thereafter left his kinsmen in peace. -And you mean they really were my ancestors? -Indisputably. They're sons, oh whom there appears to be an unnecessarily large number, moved south to Arizona, and carried on the Locharne family tradition by becoming cattle rustlers. -Well, I feel very proud. -You, Mrs. Dunne are a direct descendant of Hector Gilroy Locharne who was lynched by an infuriated mob in Dallas, Texas in 1864. -That was just before my time. -But that's wonderful. -I think a toast. To the latest and loveliest Locharne. "Here's tae us, wha's like us? Damn few and they're a'deid." -Oh, Bobby Burns again. -Robert Burns, ma'am. -No, no. It's an old Scottish toast. translated roughly into your language it means-- get hip, who's on the level? Hell of a few and they're all stiffs. Imelda. -Mrs. Dunne -Mrs. Dunne. -Well, I guess settles it. -I wouldn't let Locharne slip through my fingers now. Not for all the coal salesmen-- -Would you like a little more salmon, Mr. Phillips? -No, thank you. -Mrs. Dunne's buying the castle. -Oh, I told you she would like it. Here. -Your whiskers. -Oh. -Ms. Nicholson you've no idea what a kick I'm going to get out of this. -I think, sir, before Mrs. Dunne makes any more definite plans, we have a little business to discuss. -What was that? -I said-- [BAGPIPES] -What was that, Mr. Phillips? -I said we have a little business to discuss. -MacGregor! -I may have to leave you all early in the morning -Oh no. Must you go, Mr. Phillips? -MacTaylor! -I'd like to get everything settled after dinner. -Yeah, well, I think everything's pretty well settled now. Eh, Imelda? -MacDonald! Imelda. -Uh-Huh? -If I can stall Phillips until the morning, what about nipping into Aberdeen tonight seeing my solicitor, and getting the whole thing fixed up right away. -Well, wonderful. Let's go. And let's take our time, huh? Menzies. -Sir? -Have you been listening? -Me, sir? -Now look, Menzies. Mrs. Dunne and I are going into Aberdeen. Uh, ring Duncan's right away and order a car, will you? -OK. Is he to wait and bring you back or not? -If you mean what I think you mean, can you imagine me doing anything like that? -Yes. -Where's Ms. Nicholson? -Gone to Aberdeen to raise the Jacobite standard. -Black or white? -Black, please. No sugar. And Ms. Miller? -I think she's reading up on systems in a plumbing manual? -Thanks. Why does the earl called you boss? -I suppose he thinks I boss him. I don't. -Will you mind leaving Locharne? -Well, It's funny. We've laughed and joked about this place for so long. -But? -I have a feeling when I leave it for the last time, I'll very probably product cry. -Then why leave? I'm going to need someone around to help run the place. It Obviously ought to be you. -No, thank you. I think when the earl goes I shall go. -You mean you'll be going with the earl. -If he wants me to. -I guess you think I'm a pretty interfering woman. Maybe what I'm going to say will confirm that opinion. If I were you, I wouldn't bank too much on the earl. -Is there an American meaning to the word bank, which we don't over here? -You're in love with him aren't you? -Yes. -Is he in love with you? -No. -This is none of my business, but I think you'll have to face the possibility that when you leave this place for the last time, you may be leaving not only Locharne place but also-- -Thank you. I am facing that. -There's one other thing you're going to have to face. -Oh, what's that. -I've got a bankroll, but right now I'm minus a husband. -Bless you. What about a spot of brandy. -Thank you. -The car's here. -Thank you, Menzies. -It's not the dean though. That's away at a funeral. It's the wee [INAUDIBLE]. -What you want a car for? -Just a spot of business. I'm taking Imelda into Aberdeen. -Really? -There you are, Phillips. There a boy. Down the hatch. You're beginning to look a little bit blue. Can't have you going around the wrong color, old man. People might think you've gone over to the right. -I'll go get my wrap. -Now boss-- -Did you get your business satisfactorily settled, Mr. Phillips? -I thought it would be best to sleep on it. -Sleep on it? I see. [SNEEZES] -Bless you. -I'm sorry. Beg your pardon. -And that, Mrs. Dunne, is that. -You mean it's mine? -Including the ghost. Who will probably die of suffocation, when you install the central heating. [LAUGHTER] -A bargain if ever there was one. [INAUDIBLE] We had a man last year offering twice as much for the property. Wanted to turn it into an asylum. -Where was he from? -An asylum. -Thanks a lot. -Thank you very much. -I think on this auspicious occasion-- oh, dear, dear, dear. Never mind. I'll get another bottle from the hotel across the way. -What? In that outfit? Don't worry I'll go. -Fine. I have one or two details to discuss with Mr. Pettigrew. -$250,000? How much did you say that was? -It's near as dammit 90,000 pounds. -Lend me 35 bob will you? -35 shillings to you? -You can take it out the 90,000 pounds. -Well, perhaps this time. -But I'll be wanting [INAUDIBLE] change, mind? -OK. [MURMURING] -And a small scotch, please. Thank you. -Lord Locharne. Lord Locharne! Oh, message from the lady, sir. -What lady? -She didn't give her name, sir. She said you'd know. She's waiting for you in room 57, sir. And will you come as quick as you can? -Right, thank you. -Good night. -And a very good night to you, sir. -Did you get the message, sir? -Oh. Thank you, yes. -Room 57. -Thank you, very much. -She seemed really anxious. You should go up straight away. -Really? -In a real state she was, sir. -Was she? -Good evening, milord. -Oh. Good evening. -You've got your message? -Yes, I did thank you. -And you know the room number? -Yes, I do. -Who would have thought it. -I beg your pardon? -You, milord, of all people. -Now, look I-- -Naturally we're extremely interested. -Are you? -Yes, it caused quite a stir among the staff. -I see. It won't by chance be on the radio, will it? -I wouldn't be at all surprised. -Boy, take his lordship up to room 57. -Ah, hah, hah! -At last, sire. -I knew you'd come to meet your future subjects. Your loyal and faithful supporters. A handful at the moment, a mere handful. But great oaks from little acorns grow. It was a mere handful that rallied 'round the pretender when he landed and look where they ended up. Well, no. Perhaps not. May I present, sire, the reverend Andrew Stuart and Mrs. Stuart. Mr. Stuart favors a march of the clans on London with you at the head carrying a fiery cross, and following the itinerary of Charles Edward as far as Darby. But more of that and on when we formulate our plans. Mr. Hector Stuart of [INAUDIBLE] Ms. Fiona Stuart, Ms. Katriona Stuart, and Mr. Allister McAlpine Stuart of the glen. Mr. Stuart is of course the author of the standard work-- "Whither the house of Stuart." -The whiskey and my change. -Silence sir. And now, Mr. Isaac Goldstein, a Stuart on his mother's side. You'll get to know the other zealots during the evening. But now I'm sure your lordship would like a little refreshment. And so would we all. [CROSS-TALKING] -Now then, everybody-- "Hail to the chief." Two, three, four. -(SINGING IN UNISON) Hail to the chief, who in triumph advances. Honour'd and blest be the evergreen pine. Long may the tree in his banner that glances, flourish the shelter and grace of our line. Heaven send it happy dew, earth send it sap anew, gaily to bourgeon and broadly to grow-- [CHEERING AND CLAPPING] -Tell me, did you have anything to do with this sham? -G'night. -Night! -No keys. -No keys? -No keys. -Shh. -Menzies's window. -Menzies's? -Menzies's. -What the devil do you think you're playing at? [BELL RINGING] -Evening, boss. -Good morning. -Storm brewing. -How right you are. -(SINGING) Hail to the chief who in honor advances. [SINGING] -Scots were here while Wallace fled. Scots the Bruce have often led. [BELL RINGING] -Oh. At last. Thank goodness somebody's shown a little spirit. -A nice little thing. Rather pale. -What keeps you out all night? -Well, you can see for yourself sir. It wasn't the sex. -Morning, boss. -Good morning. -Any breakfast going? -Whatever breakfast was going has gone. And so incidentally are Mr. Blair, Ms. Miller and Mrs. Thompson. -Suits me. -You can't sit there. I haven't done that yet. -Sorry. Did you sleep well? -You may not remember this, but at 26 minutes past four this morning, I had to come down and open the door for you and your little bit of delicatessen. , -Sorry, I forgot my key. -So you explained with grim persistence until five to five. -Well, you must be admit there was something to celebrate. -I'm not in the mood for discussing any form of celebration this morning. -You know I have a feeling that you don't believe that Imelda and I went to Mr. Pettigrew's last night. -No need to keep that up. And it's news to me that Mr. Pettigrew has a chambermaid with a squid called Doris. -What do you mean a squid called Doris? -I mean a chambermaid with a-- called Doris with a squint. -I don't know what you're talking about. -When I assisted you and Mrs. Dunne to negotiate the stairs this morning, the pair of you went into hysterics over a chambermaid called Doris who apparently had a severe cast in her left eye. -Now, my dear, of course-- -Now, if you want me to believe that you spent the entire night with Mr. Pettigrew, why come in giggling like a couple of silly schoolgirls over the idiosyncrasies of a north Scottish hotel chambermaid. -You know if you'd only sneezed during that remark, it was pompous enough even for that ghastly fellow, Phillips. -It may be interest you to know that last night after listening to a program called "Down Lullaby Lane," that ghastly fellow Phillips said he wished he was married to a woman like me. -And do you wish you were married to a man like him? -He may be a bronchial boor. But at least he's not a selfish, egotistical, double-crossing, tatty example of decadent Scottish aristocracy. -Boss. Would you mind leaving the fruit alone for five minutes and taking a look at that? -You mean she's bought Locharne? -Well, what do you think? -For $250,000? -Beat us down from $300. -For Locharne? -And all our buildings and tenements and turrets appertaining. -She must have been soddled. -On the contrary, we didn't have a drink 'till after the deal was signed. -I can't believe it. -Now look, boss. You've got to believe something. You can't go through life being a doubting Thomasina. -I'm sorry. -Sorry? You ought to be cock-a-hoop! -I mean I'm sorry about not believing you. -Well I'd have explained the whole thing to you last night, if you hadn't been so hoity-toity. -I wasn't hoity-toity. -Oh, you were hoity-toity. I'd never seen anyone hoitier or toitier. Boss, steady on, boss. -When does the new chatelaine take over? -End of the month. -Where will you go? -Cuba. -Why? -Always wanted to go to Cuba. -Well, why Cuba? -Well, if you had the chance to go to Cuba, and you wanted to go to Cuba, you'd go to Cuba, wouldn't you? -Yes, I suppose. -Fine. Ring the travel bureau right away and book two passages, will you? That is, if you'd like to come. And tell them we want an even slower boat than the one that goes to China. -Oh, bless you. -Don't bless me, boss. Bless Dunne's Denver Delicatessen. [PHONE RINGING] -Oh. -Hello. Yes, this is Locharne castle. Certainly, I'll see that it's collected. Thank you Has the number 57 any special significance for you? -Baked beans. -Anything else? -I don't think so. Why? -That was the north Scottish hotel. The lady who was with you last night left a gold cigarette case in room 57 and apparently it was found this morning by the chambermaid-- squint or no squint. -Now listen, boss, I can explain everything. -If there's one thing in the world I detest it's being lied to. -Now just a minute. -Especially when it's not necessary. You flatter yourself if you think I care a hoot whether you spend every night gadding about with Colorado cuties, because I don't. -Well, there's no need to lose your temper. -I have no intention of losing my temper. There are only two qualities you possess in any quantity-- selfishness and charm. And just because you happen have a little charm you're an even more successful cheat than your sheep-stealing antics-- -Now wait a minute, who am I supposed to have cheated? -Me. Not that that matters. I'm used to it. Mr. Phillips. Letting him think he's going to get Locharne, when all the time you're doing a deal with Mrs. Dunne. -Now, look, boss. Phillips is a government official. Getting the better of a government official isn't cheating. It's human nature. -And what about your precious Imelda? I suppose you told her that Locharne is due for requisitioning. -No, I didn't. -Charming. She pays a quarter of a million dollars for this symphony in glazed brick only to find-- poor woman-- -Poor woman! You seem very concerned all of a sudden for the poor woman. -I'm not in the least concerned. I just dislike seeing even Mrs. Dunne done. -We don't know that it's going to be requisitioned. If Phillips is buying up all the coal [INAUDIBLE] in the village after only one night in the place he probably won't requisition. -If the authorities find out you've being trying to dodge requisitioning, you can bet they will requisition. Civil servants don't like being crossed. And they hate being double-crossed. -Well, you see, boss. I- I thought you'd have a word with him. Persuade him not to? -I'll certainly have a word with him. I'll also have a word with Mrs. Dunne when she shakes herself free from her hangover. -Good morning. -Good morning, Imelda. -Is this a private party? -I hear you've bought Locharne, Mrs. Dunne. -That's right. -I hope you'll be very happy. -Well, thank you very much. -Are you interested in miners' welfare? -I'll tell her, boss. -I think I should. I'm sure Mrs. Dunne would prefer an accurate version. -I said I'll tell her boss. Would you mind clearing out? -I'll certainly clear out. We've never had any sort of an agreement. I believe it's supposed to be a month's notice, but would it matter if I went today? -Suits me. -Then good-bye. -Me oh my! -I'm afraid she thinks that you and I-- well you know-- last night. -Does it matter? -Well, I just realized that it matters rather a lot. Imelda. -Uh-huh? -There's something I didn't tell you at Pettigrew's last night. -Oh? What's that? -There's a possibility-- a very vague possibility. I don't imagine for a moment it'll happen, but there is a possibility that this place might be taken over. -Taken over? Why by? -Phillips. The coal board want it for a hostel. -Well, that's too bad. They can't have it. I just bought it. -Actually, they can. Emergency restriction 227-B of 1066 and all that. -You didn't think to mention at the lawyer's. -I'm sorry. I should have. -Oh, that's OK. -Is it? -Sure. I'll just take the check back, please. -The check? -You heard me. -Supposing I paid it into the bank this morning. -Wouldn't have mattered. It's post-dated the first of next month. -So it is. -You persuade that coal salesman to change his mind and it's a deal. Until then, I'll take care of the check. -Do you mind if I have one last, lingering look? -What's do intriguing about it? -Nothing. Nothing. But it's the number of nothings actually. And there, If I'm not mistaken, is the mating call of the coal board. -Hello, Mr. Phillips. -How's the cold? -I'm completely stuffed up. -Oh, you never should have left that nice warm bed of yours. -Have you ever slept in a bed with a damp bathrobe? -Don't be silly. How could she? You were in it. -I'd like to get our little business settled now, sir. I hope I've not kept you. I've been to the village to buy some [INAUDIBLE] They asked me at the post office to bring out the bail. -Bring out the what? -The bail? -Oh yes. The bail. Yes. -I've had rather a distressing communication, myself. -Oh, don't tell me they've knocked a shilling a hundred weight off the price of nuts. -No, no. I was due for upgrading. -Up what? -Probotions. -Oh, probotion, yes. Probotion. -They tell me I've been passed over in favor of a younger man. -Aww, too bad. -I don't mind telling you I'm fed up with the coal board. -Yes, well you're not alone in that. -If I had another job to go to I'd resign here and now. -Really. Excuse me one moment, Mr. Phillips. -Now then, Phillips old chap. The very one place where anyone with a cold like yours must be. -You've got to sweat it out, boy. [INAUDIBLE] -And a couple of hot water bottles and a nice hot toddy. -No thank you. I intend to leave this place as soon as the future of this property has been decided. -That's exactly what I'm getting at. Menzies! Jesse! Come along now, Phillips old chap. There you are. Nice hot water. Just what the doctor ordered. [CHUCKLING] [COUGHING] -Down you guy. That's the style. -I- I'm afraid I'm putting you out. -What was that? -I said I'm afraid I'm putting you out. -Yes. Well, remains to be seen. Now I take it you don't find Locharne such a highly desirable residence after all. -At the moment I find it a highly undesirable residence. -Very good. -So you won't be going on with this crazy idea of turning Locharne into a hostel? -Oh yes. -You mean you will requisition. -Certainly. -Get in there. [COUGHING AND WHEEZING] -I just had the craziest idea. -What was it? -Well, if I had been able to settle down here, I'd have needed someone around to help me run the place. You mean a sort of a state agent? -Oh, more than that. Someone in complete charge. I offered the job to Ms. Trent but she said no. -More of a man's job, wouldn't you say? [CHUCKLING] Yes, I guess so. -What's sort of salary were you thinking of offering? -Oh, for the right person around eight or nine thousand dollars. -But that's as much as some cabinet ministers get. -Don't be silly. She doesn't want a cabinet minister running her home. She wants to enjoy herself. -The crazy thing is, I really need someone like a Mr. Phillips. -Mrs. Dunne, you surprise me. What you're suggesting is the worst possible form of private enterprise. -Would you mind keeping out of this? -Under your tongue. That's it. -Mrs. Dunne, I am to understand you're offering me the good job? -You don't mean you'd be interested? -Very. -What happened to your old coal board? -Damn the coal board. -Phillips, what a thing to say. And with winter coming on. Whoa. -What is it? -You're on your target. -Only one thing. There's one very big snag. -Snag? -Yeah. Now that I can't get Locharne, I'm going to have to find some other place to live. -Ahhh. -That may not be easy. -Difficult. -It may take time. -Yes. -I may never find it. -So true. -So, Now that I can't get Locharne, I guess I'll just have to forget the whole thing and go right back to Denver. -Mr. Phillips. -Hello? -Mrs. Dunne says that now that she can't get Locharne, she might have to forget the whole thing and go back to Denver. -Mrs. Dunne. -Yes. -If I were to accept the appointment you offer-- and I'd be very happy to do so-- I could accompany my resignation to the board with an adverse report on Locharne. -You're rather hard on the dear old board, don't you think? -Your grace. -Paging me. -I really meant to send in an adverse report in any case. I only decided to requisition because you were so determined to avoid it. -Mrs. Dunne, when would you like to start? -I have the date right here. The first of the month. -Thank you. Mrs. Dunne. -Thank you. -Thank you. -You're going somewhere? -Edinburgh. -Oh. -Well, you'll let us know where you are, won't you? -Do you want to know? -Yeah. Want to know where to send things on and so on. -Oh, yes. Of course. I'll probably stay there a few days with friends. Oh, is it the Watsons? -Yes. -Is he better now? -Well, he's still on a diet. -It was Tommy, wasn't it. -Yes. -Tell him I was asking after him, won't you? -Certainly. -And Mrs. Watson. -Yes, our course. -And the children. -They haven't any. Oh. By the way, I thought I'd leave you this. It must be worth at least three and six. -Isn't it yours? -Well, it's joint property. We won it in the three-legged race at Barrister Sport. Remember? -Boss, I'm going to ask you something I've been wanting to ask you before but couldn't. But this check has made it possible. I suppose you wouldn't by any conceivable chance like to marry me. You've been around so long, boss. I'm afraid I've rather taken you for granted. It's only when you're in danger of losing something that you realize how much it means. You wouldn't, would you? -What happened in the north Scottish hotel? -You know I had an idea you were going to ask me that. -Was that woman in room 57? -She certainly was. -You were? -Sure, along with Ms. Nicholson and a couple of dozen very hairy Jacobites. I'm just going introduce myself to the rest of the staff. How many did you say they were? -Most of them are on holiday. -Oh. -Lord Locharne, what a terrible thing has happened. What are you doing to Ms. Trent? Oh, I see. I've made the most ghastly blunder. -What is it? -Well will you ever forgive me? I find you're not in the direct line of succession. -Don't tell me that I've been in the wrong queue. -Last night, at least just before dawn, I had a visitation from Herman Trude such a dear and so conscientious. But look here. You remember that branch of the family tree, which had been chopped off and then lost? Well, this is it. Herman Trude has found it. And when I put in its proper place, it proves beyond all contradiction that the crown should go to the [INAUDIBLE] Locharne and not the Locharne Locharne. Oh, it's a tremendous disappointment, but I'm afraid I'm you're not rightful king of Scotland after all, and I so longed to see you crowned. -Quite a few people have longed to see that. But surely the [INAUDIBLE] Locharne-- isn't he very old? -Oh, extremely. I've ascertained that he'll be 97 next month. -Then you haven't a moment to lose, Ms. Nicholson. -No, I haven't to lose. I must start packing at once. Ms. Trent can you help me? Oh, of course. You're otherwise engaged. -Will you mind very much not being a queen? -I'll get used to it.
