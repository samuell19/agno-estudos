"The Garden of Earthly Delights" Adam's dream original sin banished from paradise Here it is. Courage, Madam, your Carla is not dead yet. For me, my dear, it's as if she was. Thank you, my dear. Gorgeous! Here it is, sir, that's your room. Thank you, sir and madam, good night. Look, it's just overlooking the sea. Would you like something? If you agree, I unpack before going to bed. I'm sure that both ones who were on the train... Exchange the rings. Do you mind if I go first to the bathroom? But why do you lock up the door? At this point up to now... My God, what a day... Would you like to call the switchboard for me? - Immediately. - What are you saying? I'm calling. Hello? Excuse me, do you mind passing me the bathrobe? Excuse me for a moment. Here it is. Thank you. Excuse me. I have to call Milan... ...579403... ...yes... Thanks. Here it is... it still stinks of incense... Let me get your shoes off. No, I'll do it. Did you call Milan? They must be already in bed... Listen... Hello? Yes, I'll put you through to her. Here's her, it's your mother. Hello? Hi, mom... Oh, listen, mom... Yes, of course, together with Carlo... Married... No, look, I'll count upon it... Still on the phone... Yes, agreed. All right. Bye, mom. Bye. Do you mind if I turn off? Oh, here you're... Are you very tired? It has been good for me to talk with mom. Come a little closer. I'm glad, you know, you've decided to quit smoking. It's my wedding present. But now try to sleep, come on. Do you know that it seems to feel something moving into my belly? It's not a big deal, come on,... ...at the third month. Good night. My God, I made it. Lead us not into temptation. Lead us not into temptation. Trust me. - I'm afraid. - Why? Are you sure you love me? What's this noise? Good! I forgot! Excuse me for a moment. Hello? Yes. Do you mind sending someone? The toilet is out of order. Ok. Excuse me for a moment. It's the doorman, he says he's coming here in person. Would you like a cup of tea, since he's coming here? Why is he coming here? No, thank you, just a juice. Hello? Also take a juice for my wife. An orange juice. Thank you. What do you want? Nothing. But, my dear, the doorman is coming here. Cover yourself well. Come in. May I come in? You may put it on the table. Can you hear it? Every five minutes... That must be the ball cock. That's what I thought too. Anyway, for tonight I've closed the main water inlet. The plumber is coming tomorrow. Tomorrow we're leaving... Oh, sorry. Newlyweds, huh? Did you put in the sugar? It's served separately, sir. Thank you. Good night. He's gone? What a peace! Here. How sour it is! Would you like some? The same is for the bloodstream,... ...as fetuses' position reveals. During pregnancy... ...sexual appetite generally decreases... ...as gestation proceeds. Let's come back now to the negative image. Are you asleep? What's up? Nothing. Lesions due to syphilis. Keratitis. Progressive paralysis. Plantar ulcer. Matches... So you smoke! Tell... Tell! - Would you like something, sir? - Have you got a light, please? Sure. I left my pack upstairs, otherwise I could offer you one. Thank you, I don't smoke. You're at 23th room, aren't you? Honeymoon... I remember that... I can talk and discuss with you but I cannot ever understand you! I'd better have married Armando, at least he respected me, get the picture? And stop saying you esteem me! That's enough! I cannot resist anymore! Do you understand? I'm tired of you and your wicked body. But what have I done to you in short? May I know? It's that you're desperately equal to yourself. This is driving me crazy! I'm feeling quiet and finished close to you. Do you mind to go and open the door? Would you like to help me with my dress, please? Who is your new nurse? Come on, eat! You could have told me you would have been late, I'm not your maid, you know. Doctor... Quiet! We must make three cuts... ...otherwise the baby won't be born. No, no, I know how to do,... ...a puncture and a kiss are needed. In any case, I... ...I'm sure babies use to come out of the belly. Not at all! Good night! Localized pruritus,... ...a symptom of diabetes,... ...abnormal glycaemia. And flowers kept on falling on his naked legs,... ...on his blood-stained chest, on his blond head,... ...and the little soldier from Lombardia slept there,... ...on the grass, wrapped in an Italian flag,... ...glad he could donate his life for his nation. Grandpa, is it nice to grow up? Sure. Yes, but is it hard? You see,... ...life is similar to that wonderful garden... ...where Adam and his partner lived,... ...a garden of joys, of delights... But what is mom doing? Does she cry? Not at all, they are playing. Look. Let's go away, come on. Reflex action. Exchange the rings. Excuse me for a moment. Lead us not into temptation. Shame. Corroded by sex. Conscience is a conjurer. Jump. They trained you to life... ...as well as they teach dogs to walk. Hey, stay here! Once again? - What does happen to you? - I don't know, father. You know it's forbidden to commit impure acts... Five Pater Gloria Ave and promise not to do it again. Lord Jesus be praised. Be good... Mr teacher! Lord, bless the food we're going to eat. - In whose name do we eat? - In the name of Father, Son and Holy Spirit. What have you done today? Pluperfect. What's it be useful for? Eat, come on. Mom,... ...is it true babies come out of the belly? Children, go to bed! Carlo told me that. Who did tell you? Idiot! So she'll be taught a lesson! Is this the education you give your sons? And you, thus? What do you claim? You never say a word! For God's sake! You cannot ever eat quietly at this table! It's easy, my dear, to go away! Come here and let's clarify things eventually. - But what do you want I say? - You disgust me, look! What can I do? Madam! Are you asleep? "Madam"... Take a seat, please. - Are you alone, madam? - Yes. - Woul you like something? - I want an apple. Nothing else? And a cofee, of course. Well, madam. Wake up! Come on. Get up sleepyhead! Come on, it's late! You're so funny! Hi! You're so beautiful. Come here! What are you doing? Damned! Take a look at the band! Would you like to wait for me for a while? It's there, come on! Would you like to lower the parasol a bit for me please? It's nice here. Would you like something? An orange juice, please. Very well, and you, sir? A coward, that's what you're... ...did you need seven years to decide I'm not the woman for you? Stop it, don't you see all the people is looking at us? Think that tonight we're already in France! - Here's the orangeade, madam. - Thank you. How good and fresh it is! What are you doing? It's time to come back to the hotel. The door is open. No, it's closed. They have already taken our bags. Do you love me a bit at least? Yes of course! Do not look! When I'll have a baby... When we'll have one... Yes, of course, when we'll have one... Here you're, you've caressed her like any other husband... It makes no sense for me! Why sullying our feelings with such a stupid comedy! Getting married! Do you want to explain to me what's the sense of it? But Carlo, I don't know... but... ...if it has always been done, it means it does have a sense. Apart from the fact that it's not true! Well, in short we cannot go on this way... And why? I'm expecting a baby. - Thank you. - Does it take a long time? Just the time for cooking, sir. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Come with me. Excuse me for a moment. May I pay the bill for room no. 23 please? - What did that woman want? - Nothing. Oh my, how hungry! Would you pass the salt to me, please? - Thank you. - You've a black mark on your cheek. It must be my makeup... even now? Even now? - Even now? - No, I was joking! It's nothing. Look out! Make room. Excuse me! Make room! Provide me with a cognac. Open up! Come in. Ah, thanks. Hello? What? Ah, the taxi! No, thanks, it's not needed anymore. It's him who killed my baby... Come on, I'm here. Hello? Please... Immediately, yes, thanks. Come in. Excuse me if I allowed myself, I'm mr Mancilli. - The owner of this hotel. - Nice to meet you. How's the lady? Nothing serious, some fever,... ...perhaps a sunstroke. How long have you been getting married? Since yesterday. Fancy that! Anything is needed, a doctor, I don't know... ...an ambulance? I'm a doctor indeed! Anyway, thank you. I think it's nothing serious. With your permission... Please do. Thank you again! At your disposal. Being here, do you want to marry as your lawful groom... Exchange the rings. Being here, do you want to marry as your lawful bride... I'm joining you forever with this woman by the sacred bond of marriage. Exchange the rings.

Misereatur vestri Omnipotens Deus... - In the name of Father, Son and Holy Spirit... - ... Holy Spirit, be it so... - Lord Jesus be praised. - Forever be praised. Sins of gluttony,... ...malice and chastity. I disobeyed my mother, I told lies... I disobeyed my mother, I told lies... I saw my mother naked into the bathroom... I peed in the vase of flowers... ...and then I pulled Virgin Mary's hair... ...like that! I'm coming near to God's altar... ...God who gladdens my youth. Now, make the sign of the cross. May I come there too? But the doll is mine, eh? Here. Bow. What are you doing? Let's pray. Here's Christ's body. Come on, let's play the doctor. Come on, it's more fun! Be careful, eh? I'm giving you God's body. Yes! Do you let me take the little bell? - It's there. - Concentrate well, come on! What are you doing! You don't know it's God's body? Idiot! Stupid! Now you'll see! - Where are we going? - Come! Now you'll see! I'm scared! You must do penance otherwise you'll go to hell! It's a mortal sin! Devil is coming to cut your legs! It's a sacrilege! Open! Bye! I didn't do it on purpose! I'm going, eh? Don't go away! Open! Open up! Poor Carla... What do you want from me? - Here're the medicines, sir. - Ah yes... - You may keep the change. - Thank you. - But sir! - Scram! It might be a bleeding. Symptoms are clear. 21... 22... 24... Try to drink, come on. It will be good for you. Come on, I'm here! - Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning, sir. Fansubbed by marooned2 & Gianni777, revised and completed by quidtum
