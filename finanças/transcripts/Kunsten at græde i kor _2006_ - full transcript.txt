I haven't praised you? That's not true. What makes you say that? I only want to praise you when you deserve it. Then and only then. I might as well kill myself. Is that what you want? - Stop it! - I'm going to hang myself. In my family staying awake at night is important - - because that's when Dad gets bad nerves and doesn't want to live. Then I hold my breath and say the Lord's Prayer for Dad. If he's still alive when I've said amen, there's still hope. What have you done? Look at me. - Sorry. I'm such a terrible person. - It'll be okay. When Dad is happy, he forgets to kill himself. And when he forgets - - so do the rest of us, and then we're alright and a normal family. SOUTH JUTLAND 1971 BIG BROTHER ASGER - Mom! Asger is here. - Hi, Asger, you wimp. What was that, you rascal? My big brother goes to polytechnic. Once he showed me a drawing. A mill seen from different angles. You could even see the inside. Dad? Come on then. Hello, Dad. My big brother Asger wants to be an architect. I'll borrow your room tonight. Alright, Allan? - You need some more gravy. - Thanks. - Goodness! - Thanks, Mom. It's delicious. Sit down, Mom. He can help himself. It tasted better last time, didn't it? Are there many girls at your school? There might be. One or two. So what's her name? That's not what I meant. I'd just like to go there. Really? You have to be good at math. Dad, were you good at math when you were in school? - You were good at doing sums. - But that's not math, is it? - No. - That's just adding. - Sorry. - He only said it to please you. - Mind your own business. - Sorry. What's wrong with holding your fork in your right hand? Everyone else eats like this. Maybe in Sonderborg, but not here. Excuse me. I have to go to the bathroom. He certainly isn't too grand to take a shit in the middle of dinner. When is Dad coming? - In a minute. Lie down. - Are you sure? Our Father who art in heaven. Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Mom? Did you take a sleeping pill? Can't you spit it out? But I've already swallowed it, Allan. For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory. Amen. What did I do wrong to make Asger turn out like that? Asger is a good boy. My father would've kicked me out on the spot. But I'm probably too soft. - So it's my own fault. - Can we go to sleep now? I'm just a milkman. I never got an education. We couldn't afford it. But I've done my best. Now there isn't even room for me in my own bed. - Go to sleep. - I have a better idea. Let's invite Asger. I'll lie in the foot end and you can kick me. Stop it. I might as well go downstairs and kill myself. I'll just grab a knife, and you'll be rid of me. Well, if that's the way you want it... Aren't you going downstairs to Dad? Mom? Come upstairs. She'll have to come and get me. - There's plenty of room for all of us. - There isn't room in your house. - Yes, there is. I can sleep here. - Your mother doesn't want me. I'm no good. Not even as a father. That's not true. You're the best father in the world. I can't do anything right. Don't cry, Dad. It wasn't a hard fall. It didn't hurt. When I'm dead and buried, will you promise to take good care of Mom? Sanne? Did he hit you? Is Dad unhappy? And has Mom gone to bed? Is he on the sofa? - Then I'd better go down there. - I think so too. Is Asger up? - Don't tell Asger, okay? - Okay. Good morning. What were you all doing last night? We were sleeping. I thought I heard you running up and down the stairs. Is that true? No. I grew up in this family too, Allan. Not so that you'd notice. I know what it's like when Dad starts crying. Then he threatens to do all kinds of things. - But I won't let him do that to you. - And he doesn't. What happened then? Do you promise not to tell Sanne? What mustn't I say? I can make her go downstairs and comfort him and make him happy. Are you sleeping with your own daughter? - What are you on about? - You bastard! - Don't, Asger. Stop that! - What's wrong? Asger, stop it. - Let him go. - Call the police. Let him go! Let him go! Let him go! Don't get mixed up in this. I don't want you here. - Get out of here! - Don't you understand? Get out! Mind your own business. There we go. That should be enough food for a week. - Fine, Mom. - Isn't it time for Dad's lunch? He's probably reading Donald Duck. - What's he done wrong? - He hasn't done a thing wrong. - Are you hungry? - No. - Have I done something wrong? - No, what could that be? The bus will be here in a minute, Mom. - Goodbye. - Asger! Asger, what has Dad done wrong? If it happens again, then call me. Even if it means moving in with me. GROCER BUDDE Dad's competitor is Grocer Budde. His son Nis is our worst moped rowdy although he's the youngest. Nis will inherit his father's shop when he grows up. Budde has introduced self-service, which had us laughing. As if you'd want to serve yourself. Now he's expanded again - - and we're not laughing anymore. Budde gets violent if he doesn't get his way. Johannesen! Johannesen! We overlook it, so he won't go to jail. - They're here, Dad. - Hi, Nis. He and his family are the only ones who suffer for it. Hello, Johannesen. When will you move the firewood? - It's blocking the road. - We'll move it immediately. Allan. Come out, milkman! Nis comes at all odd times of the day. What are you doing? Do you know what time it is? - Can we buy some booze? - You've got some nerve. You'll have to cross the border for that. Or go to your father's. He makes his living selling it to the likes of you. - You need a thrashing. - Tough guy, eh? We'll soon buy you out. - I refuse to go downstairs. - You have to! - I won't do that anymore. - He's very unhappy. You must go! I won't do it. Look at this. See that guy? You can pray to him. He'll solve all your problems. With his flaming sword? Yes. With his flaming sword. Have you tried praying to him? Come over here. Do as I do. Dear angel. I give you to my little brother. Hear his prayer. Amen. Come and kneel here. Fold your hands. Then state your wishes and say amen. Okay. Dear angel. Hear my prayer. Let Dad come to bed tonight. And let Mom be good to him. And take your sword and chop up Grocer Budde. Amen. Today is a day of mourning. There's been a serious accident. Someone many of you know is no longer among us. Last night, Grocer Budde's son, Nis - - was hit by an oncoming truck while on his moped. He is no longer among us. Let us fold our hands, close our eyes and pray for Nis Budde. We ask thee, Lord, to welcome Nis - - and to preserve the Budde family in this time of sorrow. - What happened to Nis is my fault. - Why? - I prayed that Budde would die. - But he didn't. Nis did. - But I hoped a bit that Nis would too. - You didn't pray for it, did you? It's not your fault. - You taught me how. - Are you saying it's my fault? We are both to blame. - I don't want your angel anymore. - Did you really believe in it? Stop that. Stop it. Come here, Sanne. Come here, or I'll tell Dad. If I go to a funeral, I'm expected to say something. Yes, but you don't have to. I think Dad should give a speech. - Me too. - Budde hasn't asked me to. Exactly. - It's best if we stay home. - Stay home? We can't do that. The whole town will be there. We can't stay home. - What will people think? - You said we have to help others. Maybe Budde wants Dad to give a speech, but he doesn't dare ask him. Yes. That's enough, you two. Dad can't give the eulogy for Nis - - when Budde hasn't asked him to. It just isn't done. You know what he's like. - I think it would comfort him. - Yes. Yes. No, we're staying home. Then we'll stay home. Morning, vicar. I just want to tell you that my dad will give the eulogy. - Have you talked to Budde about it? - About what? About giving the eulogy at his son's funeral. One must help when one can in times of sorrow. I'll just say a few words, as is our way here. - You might as well get used to it. - I'll let you have the floor. Much obliged. - You know what I think. - About what? About your eulogy. Once you get into your stride... - Then what? - It's as if you think you're Jesus. - And you're not. - I never said I was. - Dad doesn't look at all like Jesus. - Quiet! Before we take leave of Nis, someone would like to say a few words. We are very small, and the Lord is very great. But the Lord is with us. He's with us on this day when we must bury... Nis. When we must... Dear Nis. By now you know - - that the Lord is with us from here to eternity. He watches over us and makes us strong in times of sorrow. Dear Nis. Today our thoughts go to you and your family. Your father and mother are grieving, as everyone must bear their grief - - when they are struck by the reality of life. I cannot comfort you. I cannot help you forget your loss. Your son, whose life had hardly begun. You passed away before we did, but we will never forget you. For blessed are those who mourn, and blessed are the pure in heart - - for they will be the sons of God, just like Nis is a son of God. Farewell, Nis. Farewell. May the beneficent God bless you and give you peace. Dad says that at some point we are struck by the reality of life. I think Grocer Budde has reached that point. Dad and I can take pride in helping him get there. It won't be forgotten. - Thank you for your words. - You're welcome. By the way, can I have milk delivered again? Not now. Call me later. That was beautiful. You did a good job. My husband can't express it, but I know he feels the same way. - Would you like to thank him? - Thank you. We're only human. - You sure put Budde in his place. - Have you no respect for the dead? What are you smiling about? Now I know how to make Dad happy when you can't be bothered. AUNT DIDDE Aunt Didde talks about illness and has difficulty chewing. It's gross. Mom boils the cups and plates she's used in a big pot. We don't want to catch something. Now her heart is dodgy, and she was in the hospital. We thought she'd die, but she got better. As usual. It's as if God won't take her home and doesn't know - - that Dad would give her a good eulogy. Didde? Didde? Dad, Didde is dead. Didde? Didde? - Are you ill? - Yes... Grab hold of her, Allan. - Up you go. - Thanks. - How long were you lying there? - I dropped my bible last night. When I was going to get my pills this morning, I must have tripped on it. Allan, could you get my pills for me? There's a good boy. All of them, please. Actually, we just came to invite you to my birthday. - I don't think I can make it. - We can drive you both ways. Bring them to me. - I have to take these to stay alive. - Really? If you take the wrong ones, you get very sick. I've tried it. I almost died. Look at these. The red ones. They're for my heart. But I can only take one a day. More would kill me. Can I see them? - Look, Dad. These could kill you. - Put them back. So how are things at home? Is your father good to you? - Mind your own business. - Be good to your children! Come on, Allan. We're leaving. - Are you coming to his birthday? - Maybe. I don't know. - Don't you think she'll die soon? - I hope not. We could use another funeral. Damn it. Aren't we going to sing the second verse? Never mind, Allan. - Do have some more cake. - Yes, do have some more cake. What about presents? Did anyone bring one? I'm too old for that. I have. Give it to your father. You shouldn't have, Mom. That wasn't necessary. - Look at these. - My goodness! - They're too small. - No, they aren't. Try them on. - They fit fine. - We're buying the neighbor's farm. - You're a busy man, Kedde. - We also bought a new car. With custom-made rims. - The cake is delicious. - No, it was better last time. I have a pain in my heart. If I don't take the right pill, I'll die. - Is it very serious? - It certainly is, Little Allan. Did you remember to take one of the red ones? No, I took one this morning. I mustn't take too many. Take another just to be on the safe side. - Be quiet, Allan. - I just love that boy. You care a lot about me, don't you? - How old are you, Sanne? - 14. Almost 15. Be careful. That's a dangerous age. When I was 14, I got pregnant. Father struck me with the whip he used on the horses. But it didn't do any good. Nowadays young people are good at protecting themselves. - I'm careful. - You can't protect yourself from that. - Have some more cake. - Your father took me to the quack. - I was told to. - Yes, Henry. It was for the best. I had to work, and your father cried all day thinking he was in the war. But when I see how it's affected you, I regret my decision. I really do. I'm sorry, Didde. - At least I had a happy childhood. - Thank you. What about my dad's childhood? What about him? He told me he had to get up at 4:30 to put food on the table for you. If your father hadn't been so mean, I would have had a child of my own. You must see our pictures from Costa del Sol. Kedde thought sangria was juice, so we called it sangria juice. Aren't you paying attention? I'm being accused of atrocities on my birthday. You owe me respect. After all I've done for you. I don't owe you anything. I've worked since I was seven. After all I've done! Isn't that right, Mom? Stop it, Henry. - Stay here! - How much do I owe you? You can't put a price on it. Stop that. - How much? - Cut it out! Behave yourselves. Do you hear? - What's going on? - Didde! Get out of the way. Didde. Didde is often on her deathbed, and we gather to feel the reality of life. When she pulls through, the doctor says she's a tough cookie. And we all meet for coffee. - Is she dead? - No, I don't think so. She needs all the rest she can get. - How long does she have? - It's hard to say. Her heart is poor. It's not natural to watch your children die. Let's see what happens. She's surprised us before. I'll be right out here. Are you feeling better, Sanne? Sanne! - Do you think I'm going crazy? - Why do you ask? - Dr. Madsen thinks so. - Have you talked to him? Yes. He talked to Dad too. He thinks we're both going crazy. Mom too. He's not sure about you. You're not like us. Do you promise not to say anything if Aunt Didde suddenly dies? What? - With 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, I said. - You're always so damn lucky. No, I'm clever. Allan, help me count the cards. Is that you, Allan? Are you trying to cheer me up? You sweet boy. Didde? It's over. We've taken leave of you many times - - and thought your trials were over. But you certainly cheated us. You didn't want to let go. You wanted a little more of life. We've cried together, and we've laughed together. I don't think the Lord wanted you before you had a good laugh. And now all your worries are over, Didde. No more pain, no more illness. - Go away. - Are you going to kill everyone? - Just to make Dad happy? - No. Didde, you were the angel in the family. Mom... Thank you. PER THE MOPED ROWDY Sanne has found a boyfriend. Per, and he's a moped rowdy. They don't even respect the police. Mom says that Per seems nice - - but Dad says the branch must be bent while it's young. Per is a branch that hasn't been bent in time. - Thanks for a nice evening. - You too. Ready? 1, 2, 3... Now! Hands off! Let go! - What's that? - Something I borrowed from Per. Now it's broken. Yes, just keep going. You're grounded for a week. - Stop that! - Leave her alone for a while. - Can't I discipline my children? - There's more than one way. We'd better call Dr. Madsen so we can get some peace. Out! - Just go out, okay? - Turn down the music. Dad called Dr. Madsen. - You're not allowed to smoke. - You're not allowed to kill. What's wrong? If I want to be with Per, it's none of your business or Dad's. And if I want to hear music, I bloody well will! Evening, Sanne. I hear you're a bit upset. Allan, out! Go to your room. Mom? Mom? Else? Aren't we having breakfast today? I was thinking that... You know, on Saturday there's a dance at the hotel. And you said that Sanne could go, right? - Will that rowdy be there? - No. No, he won't. Sanne broke up with him. You're too young for that stuff. In my opinion. - Then Allan will go with her. - Me? - He can't go to the dance. - If Allan can't go, you can't either. Well... - I guess he can come. - Come on, Allan. There's Daddy's girl. Come on, Allan. Allan! I have to tell you something. Don't let her out of your sight. If something that shouldn't happen happens, then tell me about it. - Deal? - Yes. - Here's money for soda. - Thanks. Bye, Dad. Have you got a new boyfriend? Look, he's already found a new girl. It's just like Dad said. - You were a one-night stand. - Be quiet. - Children under 12 must be quiet. - Quiet, quiet, quiet. Can I borrow the keys to your car? I was wondering... Do you want to dance? Sanne! A little boy like you doesn't know how to make babies, do you? - No. - Do you want to see? Look. Let's say this is your thing. You have to grab it and shake it. If foam comes out, you can make babies. No foam, no babies. Let's see if the bottle can make babies. Come on. Let's have a dance. I thought you didn't want to see me. - I didn't dare call you. - You could have. I didn't know what to say. What would happen if I tried to kiss you? - Leave them alone. - No. - Go on now. Go away. - Let go! Sanne! Sanne! - Sanne! - Jesus Christ, Sole! - He was watching you. - I want to go home. I'm cold. Then go. I have to go with him. Wait! - Is there something wrong? - Sole poured beer on me. - I'm cold. - A change of shirt will fix you up. - Thanks for driving them home. - Come in and have a beer. - A beer? You bet! - I imagine you drink beer, don't you? Will you get the beers? Allan and I will change his shirt. Do come in. - Did they kiss? - I think so. Did he have an erection? - What does that mean? - Was his willy pointing upwards? - I didn't see that. - Didn't you? That can't be true. Tell Dad what happened. Don't be ashamed. Was his hand between her legs? - Allan? - No. I would have noticed. Think carefully. Was his willy out? It might have been when I wasn't there. Go down and join the others. It was Sanne's first dance. Isn't that right, Sanne? - Can I take Sanne back there? - Isn't the party over? Off you go. - Thanks for the beer. - How about one for the road? Aren't your ears ringing from all that hippie music? No, they weren't playing as loud as they could. We don't listen to that kind of music. Are we expecting somebody? Who could that be? - Come in. - Thanks, Johannesen. - Are you hiding some young men? - Have they done something wrong? Evening. Is there a Per Lauritzen here? That's me. I heard you were messing with a girl under the age of 15. You know that's a criminal offence, don't you? - What are you talking about? - You've been seen. You can't keep your pecker in your pants. - You didn't... - Mind your own business. I want to talk to you. Let's go! Sanne? What happened, Sanne? Thanks for your help, Allan. GRANDMA It was strange that Grandma didn't visit us very often - - considering how big a picture we had of her. And she only had a little picture of Dad. His was the smallest of them. Mom said that didn't mean anything. Dad was always in her thoughts. Mom? Mom? Mom! Mom... I'm afraid it's too late. Mom! Mom? Mom? - Sanne, you have to go to Dad. - Why? He's unhappy. Really unhappy. - Good. - Why is that good? - Because that's what I wanted. - What do you mean? I set fire to Grandma's house. What? I went to her shed and found some petrol. Then I locked her door from the outside and blocked the back door. Did you really? Dad took Per away from me, so I took Grandma away from him. - We need Dr. Madsen. You're crazy. - Where do you think I got the idea? - Dad will kill himself. - He won't. You don't know that. It's just something he says so we'll feel sorry for him. - I do feel sorry for him. - He can make us do anything. That's not true! - He cries until I undress. - So what? Then I lie down and grab his cock. Didn't you say that you killed Grandma? Yes. Then go to Dad. You made him unhappy. - So you have to make him happy. - I'm done with that. - Okay. Then tell me what to do. - What? Tell me. If you won't do it, I'll have to. What are you waiting for? What's wrong with her? I don't know what to do. She won't open the door. It's locked. I don't know what to do. What should I do? Can't you do something for once in your life? Come, Allan. Sanne? Open the door. It's just you. - Allan, open the door. - Don't let him in. Promise? Allan, open up! Allan. Don't! - Sanne, what's wrong? - There, there. Come down and have breakfast. - I killed your mother. - What? - I killed your mother. - What are you talking about? - I killed your mother. - Don't say that. - I killed your mother. - I won't listen to that. - I killed your mother. - Stop it! I killed her! I set fire to her house! I'm going to say it at the funeral. - Should we call Dr. Madsen? - No! Not him! - I think we should. - Don't. I'll tell Asger. Or Allan will. Won't you, Allan? - Sanne! - Sanne, come here. Come with me. She should be admitted to Augustenborg. It's all in her mind. - We can take care of her. - May I borrow your phone? There's one in here. - Doctor... - Henry! You heard what the doctor said. - She shouldn't be with psychos. - Stop it. - Why can't she stay here? - You only think about yourself. - I only think about our daughter. - And I sent her to the hospital. And leave her to a psychiatrist? She could say all kinds of things. Don't worry. They are bound to secrecy. She needs to get away. To have peace and quiet. You're not going anywhere. - It's your fault. I'll kill myself... - Go ahead and do it! Dad. Come and sit down. - Come here, Dad. - Allan... Allan, my boy... Does anyone want to say a few words? Dear Mom... You... Nothing for me. Listen how he's wallowing in their pity. It's disgusting. If there's any news about Sanne, you have to call me. I won't let her go through this anymore. That's what makes her sick. But then Dad would have killed himself. Do you really believe that? No. We haven't heard much from Sanne. But she's probably better off there. And what do they do to her apart from injections and shock treatments? How often is she put in a straitjacket? Can she get cigarettes? Can you smoke in a straitjacket while getting shock treatments? I'll pick her up this afternoon. After my milk route, I'll pick her up. No. I beg your pardon? No, that's up to me! She's my daughter. That's all there is to it. Goodbye. - This isn't Augustenborg. - Yes, that's the mental hospital. - Crazy people don't live here. - All the loonies do. Mind they don't keep you. - You can't come in here. - My sister Sanne is right over there. My name is Else. I take care of your sister. I've talked to your mother. You've run away from home. I had a head start. My dad is coming. You'll have to wait till he arrives. Then you can see her together. - Is she very ill? - No, she'll be alright. - Will she come home soon? - I should think so. - Can't you keep her? - It isn't necessary for her. If your father wants to take her home, she can go. She can't take any more of lying with him on the sofa. Does she lie with him on the sofa? Have you seen her do that? Yes. What do they do on the sofa? Touch each other? If what you say is true, it's very serious. - It's a criminal offence, you know. - I didn't. But you still claim they touch each other? - Is that your father? - Yes. Let's go and say hello. How are you? Look what I brought for you. Have you quit smoking? Sanne, answer me. There... Allan! Sanne! Where have you been? Mom and Dad are so worried! - Are you having a baby? - Yes. - Haven't you told them? - Come in. It's freezing outside. Here you go. Is it alright? - Can we live here then? - Of course you can. Let's find you some pajamas. Just relax and warm yourselves. Lie down! It's probably not as bad as we think. Hi, Allan. So you've been... Don't yell at him. It's bad enough that you've come. - You've had an adventure. - Sanne isn't going home. The police are looking for you. - Sanne isn't going home. - She's going back to Augustenborg. - But she isn't sick. - They're sending an ambulance. - It's best this way, Allan. - Sanne, darling... Leave her alone. Don't touch her! - You said we could come any time. - Just don't do what Dad wants. Then everything will be fine. What did you say to the psychiatrist? Nothing. We have to stick together, Allan. Otherwise we won't make it. Yes. Thank you. Bye. Next? Can I help you? Hello. - I need to talk to you. - Come through. I've received a letter about you and your daughter. We have to start an inquiry. - Have a nice day. - You too. Henry! Don't you dare! Don't you dare! What are you staring at? Go home! Call an ambulance! Dad didn't manage to die. He woke up several times - - and the same thing happened. Mom said he knew what'd happened and that's why he cried. He had witnessed the reality of life. When that happens, you cry. But he cried every time. As if the reality of life struck him every time. MOM The store thrived after Dad went to the hospital. Mom sold booze to young people after closing time. What would you like? A bottle of schnapps? - And some lemon soda. - That'll be 35 kroner. Sanne got well, but the psychiatrist said she shouldn't go hom. Asger bought a used VW, since Mom didn't have a license. He found a nice foster family for Sanne. That was the last of the booze. Now to the candy. Chocolate bars. 1.25 kroner. Dad used to write the prices, but now I did. And I did a good job. Mom meticulously tried all the booze. She wanted to know what she sold. Dad didn't do that, but Mom and I did things our own way. - No peeking at the cards. - I won't. Johannesen residence. Hello. I see. I see. Thank you for calling. Bye. Was it the hospital? Is he dead? Allan... No. He's feeling better. Then Dad came home. I think the town forgave him. I'm not sure I forgave him. I missed Sanne and dreamed about her. Some people even pitied Dad - - because he was going to prison, and that would be hard on him. But then Mom and I would be alone again. Every cloud has a silver lining.
