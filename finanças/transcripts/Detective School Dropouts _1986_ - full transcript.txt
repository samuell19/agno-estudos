[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] WILSON: It was another hot, muggy day in New York City, yet my blood ran cold. As I moved down the dirty alley, I fell something crawl up my spine, and I couldn't shake the memory of the one-eyed man. The walls were closing in on me. After all, it was only three days since the Princess was splattered all over that cheap hotel room. -Suddenly-- -Wilson! Will you put that book down and get the mannequins inside -before it rains? -WILSON: Yes, sir. -MAN: Now! -Yes, sir. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] WILSON: Suddenly, a shot rang out as my eyes clouded over, and I fell into a sea of blackness. [SCREAMS] Rape! Rape! You're fired, Wilson! Get out! Get out! Get outta here or I'll kill you! [WOMAN SCREAMS] WILSON: Detective novels, they were ruining my life. I had to get my mind off of them. I really wanted to do well at my new job.

And fate had something else in store for me, far away in sunny Italy. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [TIRE SCREECHING] [GUNSHOTS] WILSON: For centuries, three families had been fighting over Italy's cheese business: the Zanettis, the Lombardis, and, meanest of all, the Falconis.

She's probably back at that house where we met Bruno. -Let me see the pendant. -I don't have the pendant. Why? Is it valuable? DON ZANETTI: I'm asking the questions. Excuse me, do you speak English? Just a moment. Oh. [GASPS] Yes? Never mind. Thank you. Uh, may I have some? Thank you. Very good. Thank you and goodbye. Goodbye. Shit. Holy shit. Oh. Oh, you found me. Can I help you?

I got it. -Can I see it? -No. Hey, it's half mine, remember? We're partners? Not since you walked out, we're not. I was only kidding. Can't you take a joke? Ha-ha-ha. Why won't you believe me? I told them everything. May I at least carry the pendant? No. -Where are you going? -I told you. I'm gonna find Carlo Lombardi and then gonna stop that wedding. While I searched for him, Carlo, who was driven to despair by the loss of Caterina and the prospect of marrying Sonya Falconi, was searching for a courageous way out. [GUNSHOT] [CLEARS THROAT] So much for courage. DON LOMBARDI: Carlo? [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [GUNSHOTS] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Si,papa. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] -[SPEAKING ITALIAN] -[SPEAKS ITALIAN] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] DON LOMBARDI: [SPEAKING ITALIAN] [SPEAKS ITALIAN] [SPEAKS ITALIAN] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] MILLER: Holy mackerel!

[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] [ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Forgive me, Father. Okay. I have sinned against the Holy Church. That's not bad. I have killed 47 men. That's bad. Will I burn in hell? I don't know. Do you play with yourself? Oh, no, Father. Well then, you still have a chance. You should, uh--should-- you should say three Hail Marys and stop killing people. No, Father. I must kill again. There are two who must die. They will die painfully, not quickly. That will be another three Hail Marys. [ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] WOMAN: Forgive me, Father. I was really bombed last night, and I met these two men and... [ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING] DON FALCONI: Bruno! [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [ENGINE STALLS] Having problems, Brother? Listen, these are Trappists. They're not allowed to speak. MILLER: Shit! We're out of gas! Ow, God dammit, what are you doing? -Sorry. -Why didn't you tell me they were there? What's the matter with you? -I tried. -You didn't try. You were kicking me, that's what you were doing. -Don't push me.-Look, the thing was your idea. I wanted to sell it. -You don't sell your first case.-Yeah, your first... I told you not to push me! That's it! That's it! Now I've had it! You wanna fight? You want to fight? You want to fight? Okay, let's go! Let's go! Come on. All right, I'm ready. You ready? Here I come, here I--ah-hah! Oh! Sorry you made me do that. I really... [GRUNTS] God.

The whole thing's a waste of time. I gave them the message already. Why should I start believing you now? Forget about it. Right now, we have to get some gas money. How we're gonna do that? We're in The Vatican. Have faith. WOMAN: Excuse me. Excuse me! Hey, monks! My husband would like a picture of us in front of The Vatican. Would you please take our picture? Thanks. Fix your jacket. Stand up straight, Leon. Think tall. I got some monks to take a picture of us. [SIGHS] They don't make monks like they used to.

WILSON: I got a real bad feelingabout this. MILLER: It's a piece of cake, Donald. I'm gonna lower you down to Carlos' window, you show him the pendant and give him the message, and then we get the hell outta here. WILSON: I could get killed. -MILLER: I'm willing to risk it.-I'm not. Are you sure you don't wanna change places? Absolutely. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Psst, psst! Psst! Psst! [SPEAKS ITALIAN] Listen. Carlo. I'm from America and I have a message from Caterina. Caterina? Oh, shit! Hiya, Bruno. We were supposed to give this to Mario. Drop the rope. Oh, come on, Bruno. Drop him. She wanted you to see this. Sorry, Donald. [SCREAMS] Ooh. [BRUNO GASPING] Have this back by Tuesday, will you, Bruno? [SCREAMS] [GLASS SHATTERS] MILLER: Donald? Donald? Are you okay?

I must go now. I must marry Sonya. Thank you. Good luck to you and the best of everything. That's it. Come on, let's go. Let's go? What're you talkin' about? Look, it's over, Donald. You gave him the message, you've been a good scout, now let's get outta here before the Zanettis find me or the police find you or he wakes up. [BRUNO GROANS] MILLER: Oh, no. This guy thinks he's Rambo. -Come on, let's go-- -No. What's the matter with you? No, they still have Caterina. I'm supposed to stop that wedding, -and that's what I'm gonna do. -Enough is enough, Donald. -You're gonna get yourself shot.-Fine, I'll get myself shot. It's better than going back to what I was. You wanna go? Go. Don't worry about, me. I can take care of myself. -[GROANS] -[THUDS] MILLER: Come on, get up. Let's go. I've never been to Venice anyway. By the way... you dropped this. DON ZANETTI: The wedding tomorrow will be more than either the Falconis or the Lombardis ever dreamed of. When Carlo Lombardi kisses his bride for the first time. The waters of Torcello will run red, with blood of both their families. [YAWNING] Where are we? How the hell should I know? WILSON: Guess there's no such thing as the Leaning Tower of Venice? No, I guess not. Fix that thing.

I'm going to try and rescue the girl. -Okay. Wait a minute! -What? How do I stall a wedding? I don't know. Throw yourself on the floor. Have an asthma attack. I don't have asthma.

[SPEAKING ITALIAN] [WEDDING MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] WILSON: And so the long bloody feud was ended when Carlo finally married his Caterina. Don Zanetti was so grateful, he offered us a $25,000 reward. But Paul turned it down, and insisted on taking that old pendant instead. I can't believe it! Trust me, Donald, okay? Twenty-five thousand dollars, and you took a pendant? This pendant is gonna be worth a lot more -than twenty-five thousand. -I hope so. Remember, no guts, no glory. Follow me. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] How old did you say this was? The guy told me it was 500 years old. Hmm. He said it was worth millions. -Millions? -MILLER: Millions. I don't know about millions. I knew it, I just knew it! Maybe a half a million. Half a million! I told you! I told him! You'd give us half a million? Well, I've gotta make some money on this deal, too. -How about, um, 300,000? -Really? How about 400,000? How 'bout 200,000? How about 300,000? Right now? Cash? Yeah, I think I can do that. Do that. Three-hundred thousand. You wanted to settle for 25,000. Okay. I panicked. I was wrong. You were right, I was wrong. No guts, no glory. No pain, no gain. No tickee, no shirt. APPRAISER: One, two, three hundred thousand. That's Italian money. I know. It's lire. Three-hundred thousand lire. What's that in American money? It's a hundred seventy three dollars and twenty-seven cents. BOTH: A hundred and seventy-three dollars? And twenty-seven cents. A hundred and seventy-threedollars and twenty-seven cents. -Shut up. -Oh, you're angry, is that it? -Yeah, yeah, I'm angry. -What do you wanna do? You wanna hit me? Is that it? You think you'll feel better if you hit me? I mean, I don't think you'd feel any better at all, but if you really wanna hit me,then you hit me, okay? [GROANS] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING]
