He's not there. ﻿I thought maybe you saw if he left the hotel or something. ﻿Actually, yes. Earlier, ﻿at about 7:00, he and Maria, ﻿but I don't know where they went. ﻿Maria? Who is Maria? ﻿Don't worry, ﻿Maria is somebody who hangs out here, ﻿she's all right, I mean, everybody knows her. ﻿We'll never get to the ceremony on time. ﻿That's for sure. ﻿Can you take our picture, please? ﻿What? -Take a picture. -Take a picture of us. ﻿Thank you very much. ﻿What, you are the Prime Minister or something? ﻿I used to be a football player. ﻿Some people still remember. ﻿What's your last name? ﻿Theo. ﻿Markaris Theo. ﻿No! -Yes. ﻿Seriously? -Yeah. ﻿You're Markaris Theo? -Yes, I am Markaris Theo. ﻿You are the best Greek player for... ﻿European championship 1980, king of goals! ﻿I'm surprised you remember. -If I remember?! ﻿That was the best Greek team ever! ﻿You've changed, huh? -I quit football ﻿and now I'm... ﻿driver for the mayor. ﻿You know my father, he is crazy about you. ﻿If he will know that you are Markaris Theo ﻿he will faint. ﻿We'll find your father first. ﻿Avraham was only 7 ﻿when his family was sent to Auschwitz in 1943 ﻿when the German army invaded Saloniki. ﻿Miraculously, he found refuge with his neighbor, ﻿a 16-year-old Greek magician named Theodoros Papaloukas ﻿who introduced him to the world of street performers so he could make a few pennies. ﻿Theodoros turned Avraham into the magician's apprentice, ﻿thus saving his life. ﻿Hello. ﻿Good evening. ﻿My name is Avraham Kofmas. ﻿I come from far. ﻿I look for a man who saved my life in war. ﻿His name is Theodoros Papaloukas. ﻿I don't know if he's dead or alive. ﻿Today I need your help. ﻿Theodoros, ﻿I came here to thank you. ﻿Thanks to you I'm alive. ﻿I raised a family, and now, ﻿after so many years, ﻿the time has come ﻿to express my thanks. ﻿Thank you. ﻿Help Avraham find him. ﻿The lines are open and we're waiting for your calls. ﻿Good night. ﻿One second, please. ﻿I want to show you something. ﻿Avraham. ﻿My father with... ﻿Maybe you know your grandpapa lived before in Thessaloniki? Yes. ﻿In a street named... maybe Komnino? ﻿I think so, Komnino. ﻿It is sure! Fantastic. ﻿I don't believe. -I'm sorry. ﻿I don't know who you are, but my grandfather passed away. ﻿Dead? ﻿I'm sorry, sir. ﻿We loved him dearly. I'm sorry. ﻿I was his assistant in the theater. ﻿Big magic man, your grandpapa. Big magic man, Theodore. ﻿Who? ﻿Theodoros. ﻿Theodoros? -Yes. ﻿I think there's been a mistake. ﻿My grandfather's name was not Theodoros, ﻿it was Sals, Sals Papaloukas, ﻿and he died two years ago. Prostrate cancer. ﻿Good. Very, very, very good. ﻿Excuse me? ﻿No, no. No good. ﻿So sorry he's dead. ﻿Mistake. Thank you. ﻿Please, not now. ﻿Are you spying on me? ﻿Maria, meet Yehuda. ﻿Hello, I'm Maria. -Hello. Nice meeting you. ﻿He's religious. He not give hand to woman. ﻿You're not angry, eh? -No. ﻿Where've you been? ﻿We've been looking for you for hours. We're worried to death. ﻿Did you forget about the ceremony? ﻿I'll be leaving. ﻿I hope you"ll find him. ﻿Maria, ﻿thanks for all you do. ﻿I come to see you again before I go? -Okay. ﻿Who's she? -None of your business. ﻿Who you hang around with in Greece is my business. ﻿She's helping me. ﻿Maria? -Maria. ﻿Why don't you ask me? ﻿I'm here to help you. ﻿Do you even know who she is? ﻿Is this that Papaloulou guy? ﻿Papaloukas. ﻿Theodoros Papaloukas. ﻿Okay, sorry. Papaloukas. ﻿There's no one to look for. ﻿All the numbers I got... They're dead. ﻿He's probably dead, too. ﻿I was a fool to come here. ﻿Avraham... ﻿What's the matter? ﻿Are you all right? ﻿It's nothing. ﻿I'm fine. I'll get ready and I'll go. ﻿You don't have to get ready. Rest a bit first, okay? ﻿Please ﻿Let's make a deal. ﻿I'll go to the ceremony with you, ﻿and back home. ﻿After that, God willing, you'll never see me again. ﻿I promise you'll never hear from me again. ﻿Okay? ﻿Avraham, ﻿do you know who this is? ﻿It's Markaris Theo. ﻿Markaris Theo from the Greek national team ﻿to European championship in 1980. ﻿We watched it together. ﻿He got past three players, got into the goal area, ﻿and blasted one just under the goalpost. Remember? ﻿In the quarterfinals. They came in fourth. ﻿That's not him. -Not him? ﻿He told me. ﻿That's not him. ﻿Some people even asked for his autograph. ﻿That's not him. -Yes it is. ﻿Hey, hey. ﻿Is this Arta? ﻿No, Gardiki. ﻿Gardiki? No Arta? ﻿No, Sabbath. -What Sabbath? ﻿Please. -Your son said in one hour Sabbath begins ﻿and you cannot drive. -No, no, please. ﻿It is not like this, okay? ﻿Sir, trust me, ﻿this is the last place I want to get stuck into. All right? ﻿People wait for us in Arta, no? ﻿Ceremony, yes? ﻿So we go. Why you wait? ﻿No, it's all right. I've already spoken to the mayor ﻿and he's going to delay the ceremony until Shabbat is over. ﻿So you stay with him ﻿and I go to Arta. Shabbat! ﻿Mr. Avraham. ﻿Mr. Avraham, it's my fault. I didn't know when Sabbath begins. ﻿Avraham, come on. We can't drive on Shabbat. ﻿It's okay on Shabbat. Don't listen to him. ﻿Avraham, Markaris spoke to the mayor and he said it's okay. ﻿Be reasonable, ﻿there's no hurry, really. ﻿You know what? Don't honor the Sabbath, ﻿but at least honor me. ﻿Come on, Avraham, no one's gonna stop for you. ﻿You write, please. ﻿"To Maria, with love, ﻿"Avraham Kofmas." ﻿"Blessed are you, O Lord, ﻿"Who sanctified us with Your commandments ﻿"and granted us the holy Sabbath ﻿"in memory of the Creation, ﻿"the first of the holy acts, in memory of the Exodus. ﻿"For You chose us and sanctified us ﻿"and granted us Your holy Sabbath. ﻿"Blessed are You, sanctifier of the Sabbath." ﻿Shabbat Shalom. ﻿Shabbat Shalom. ﻿Souvlaki. ﻿Tzatziki. ﻿Yemista, stuffed vegetables, ﻿and sweets. ﻿We'll talk after. -Okay. ﻿Lamb. ﻿You know, Markiris, ﻿I was the first person to bring Tzatziki to Israel. ﻿Before, I had a cheese factory, ﻿all Greek, ﻿but people have sour hearts, like sour cheese. ﻿They don't like to see me happy when it's good for me. ﻿Cheers. -Cheers. ﻿Here. Souvlaki. Please. ﻿It made their hearts sour to see you work on Shabbat ﻿and pretend you were kosher. ﻿Everyone knew. ﻿And nobody cared. ﻿But you had to be Mr. Righteous. ﻿I asked you to stop a thousand times. ﻿You knew it affected me but you didn't stop. ﻿You thumbed your nose at me. You tested my faith. ﻿Who do you think you're fooling? ﻿I helped you stop living a lie. ﻿You sold your father out. ﻿You betrayed him. ﻿Let's see you stand before Him. ﻿If you eat pork, ﻿so you eat it fat, eh? -Of course. ﻿What? ﻿Nothing, nothing. ﻿You know her? ﻿Let's say that I knew her well a couple of nights ago. ﻿Exactly what do you mean? ﻿Half of Thessaloniki knows her. ﻿You know, this is not a big deal, all right? ﻿In my village, in Arta, ﻿we've got much, much better than her. ﻿Much, much better. ﻿Stop the car. ﻿I tell you stop the car. ﻿What's the matter? Avraham, what's the matter? ﻿You not talk on her like that. ﻿You not know her, you understand? ﻿She is a wonderful woman. ﻿Yehuda, I was just trying to explain to your father that his Maria is not... ﻿Not exactly what he thinks she is. ﻿Okay, you say one more word and I leave this car. ﻿For sure. -Don't you yell at me, all right? ﻿You may talk to your son the way you want, but not talk to me like this, ﻿is that clear? ﻿Is that clear? ﻿If your son wants to put up with you ﻿talking to him like this, I've got no problem, ﻿but I don't want this crap in my car, all right? ﻿Crap?! ﻿Okay. -All finish. ﻿Finish! ﻿Stop the car! ﻿Avraham! ﻿Calm down! -Stop the car! ﻿Please, please, please! Hey! ﻿Stop the car, I tell you! ﻿Blockhead. ﻿Avraham. ﻿Cut the crap and get back in the car. ﻿Better to be alone than in bad company. ﻿Stop being so dramatic. ﻿I'm not going anywhere with him. ﻿Let the mayor himself come get me. ﻿Okay, okay. ﻿Markaris, what did you tell him? ﻿Avraham, you're embarrassing us. ﻿You'll regret it. ﻿Okay, you go now. ﻿You call someone to come and get me. -Okay, okay. ﻿Go now. Go! -Okay, okay. Hey, hey, hey. ﻿Markaris, ignore him, okay? ﻿Ignore him. Avraham, stop it. ﻿Stop it. What's wrong with you? ﻿What are you doing? Where will you go? ﻿Markaris, what are you doing? ﻿Markaris! ﻿Markaris, he didn't mean to. He's sorry. ﻿Hey, Markaris, he's an old man. ﻿Markaris! ﻿Markaris, the Didge! ﻿The Didge! ﻿Markaris, the Didge! ﻿Gee, Thank you! ﻿Why did I have to come here? ﻿Why did I have to come all this way ﻿and why did you have to yell at him? ﻿You finally realize you shouldn't butt into other people's lives. ﻿You never learn. ﻿Not that again. ﻿You did it on purpose. ﻿You knew it would bother me and you started working on Shabbat on purpose. ﻿For God's sake, can't you see how perverse that is? ﻿Perverse is when your son decides to dress like a clown ﻿and sells his father out to his imaginary friend in heaven. ﻿That's perverse. ﻿You humiliated me. ﻿People wouldn't look me in the eye. ﻿Everyone thought I was a corrupt wheeler-dealer. ﻿And then you went into politics. ﻿Watch your mouth. ﻿Former Head of the Regional Council Avraham Kofmas. ﻿I was supposed to be playing a concert in New York now. ﻿See what I gave up for you? ﻿I didn't ask you to come. ﻿You insisted. You always force yourself on others. ﻿In the beginning it was He He exists constantly ﻿Fills the world and surrounds Everything we see ﻿Even there it's the same The same eternally ﻿I never repeated The world would always be ﻿The present and the past\ No beginning and no end ﻿He sees the future coming Yeah, everything was planned ﻿He saw the light of Torah And created the universe ﻿So He could come down And dwell here on Earth ﻿Then He contracted And left only space ﻿And then he shone His light And glory in its place ﻿Supremacy, Creation, Action and Deed ﻿The four worlds He created To follow his creed ﻿From potential to actual From intention to act ﻿He revealed the power Of the limitless - fact ﻿His being is His power His power's from above ﻿He chose His people He chose them with love, yeah! ﻿Hello? ﻿Avraham, it's Kertzner. -Kertzner? ﻿Yes. Avraham, you're on speaker. ﻿Everyone's listening. How's it going? ﻿Fine. The people here are nice. ﻿reat, great. -Beautiful town. Really something. ﻿The thing is, the mayor of Arta ﻿just called... -Tell him we're stuck. ﻿And said you're on the way from Thessaloniki ﻿and everything's okay, just one thing, ﻿that you said something in the car... -Yes? ﻿You insulted his driver. ﻿You insulted Markaris Theo. He's the Greek David Beckham! ﻿The Greek All-Star team goal king... -Kertzner. ﻿All-time soccer champion! -Kertzner? ﻿The star of Panathinaikos! ﻿The reception here is lousy. Greece. ﻿What are you doing? ﻿Hello? ﻿Maria, this is Avraham. ﻿Avraham. How are you? ﻿Thanks for the flowers. ﻿It comes from the heart. ﻿You helped me. I thank you. ﻿Listen, Maria, ﻿my son and me, we are stuck on the way to Arta. ﻿We have to be at the ceremony in two hours. ﻿Ladies and gentlemen, ﻿distinguished guests, ﻿former mayor of Be'er Tuvia, ﻿Mr. Avraham Kofinas and his guest, ﻿we owe you thanks for your initiative ﻿leading to this Twin City ceremony. ﻿Hello? ﻿Yes? ﻿You know him? ﻿Where?

Very sorry. ﻿It's okay. I know you mean well. ﻿Maria, I have a food shop in Israel. ﻿Maybe you and Thomas can come. ﻿I know I'm an old schmatte, but... ﻿Are you asleep? ﻿No, I can't. ﻿My girls. ﻿Mushki is the big one, ﻿and then Fori, Rivki, and little Rochale. ﻿Little Rochale. ﻿So sweet. -Yeah. ﻿Hopefully, God willing, ﻿tomorrow my wife will tell me that I have a son. ﻿I need to spend more time with her. ﻿I'm always in shows and rehearsals, ﻿not enough at home. ﻿You are a singer? -Yeah. ﻿And you? What do you do in your life? ﻿I'm a whore. ﻿Seriously? -Yeah, really. ﻿You know, Maria, ﻿I don't know what's going between you two ﻿and I don't want to interfere, but... ﻿I don't know if you know ﻿that my mother died three months ago ﻿and he's not so well. -It's all right. ﻿I'm a big girl. ﻿I don't believe in fairytales anymore. -Okay. ﻿You have a charming boy. My ﻿rabbi told me that ﻿only when I correct my relationship with my father, I will have a son. ﻿It's my Ki bud Av (Honoring one's father). ﻿Never mind. ﻿Anyway, I think it was a mistake coming here. ﻿I don't think it was a mistake. ﻿Look at your father, ﻿he seems pleased that you're here. ﻿What, you think? -He told me. ﻿What did he tell you? ﻿That he's having the finest days of his life. ﻿Can you play? ﻿Here? ﻿Just a little bit. ﻿Okay. ﻿Okay. ﻿Wow, cool. ﻿Can I try? ﻿No, I'll show you. ﻿You have to do like this with your mouth. ﻿Yeah, go like this. ﻿You do "foo." ﻿Thomas, when we go to Israel with Avraham, ﻿you want us also to visit Yehuda? ﻿Avraham, ﻿can I speak to you alone? ﻿What's the problem? Go ahead. ﻿No problem. Can I speak to you alone? ﻿Excuse me. -One minute. ﻿What was so important that you couldn't tell me there? ﻿What are you doing? ﻿You want to bring her to Israel? ﻿Are you kidding? -Why not? ﻿Why not? ﻿Mom just died, that's why not! ﻿We're still mourning and you're partying! ﻿You don't even know her. ﻿She'll take better care of me than you will ﻿when you're busy praying in Jerusalem. ﻿I don't care what you do with your life ﻿or your health, but one thing I will ask, ﻿show some respect for Mom. ﻿Okay, we should start to go. ﻿Avraham, I don't think I'll join you this time. ﻿I really need to get back to Thessaloniki. ﻿What happened? Why? ﻿It's just that... ﻿It's just that I don't think you need me anymore. ﻿Thank you. ﻿Thank you, Maria, for everything. We appreciate your help. Really. ﻿We will update you from the way. ﻿Get out. ﻿You can get a bus back from here. ﻿What? ﻿What do you mean? ﻿I mean it's over. ﻿You're going back to Israel. Get out. ﻿I'm not going back without you. ﻿Get out, I said. -I'm not getting out. ﻿You think you can stay here alone? ﻿Haven't you had enough? ﻿That's life. ﻿You trust people and they stab you in the back. ﻿Whatever you want. ﻿What are you gonna do? Look for that Papaloukas guy? ﻿You don't even have any money. ﻿I'm not leaving you here alone. ﻿You may not believe it, but I care about you. ﻿Suddenly you care about me? ﻿You didn't even know who Papaloukas was until you came here. ﻿Because you never bothered to tell us, ﻿you only care about yourself. ﻿You haven't been one of us for years. ﻿You bewitched your mother. ﻿She started to light candles. ﻿Okay, you're schizo, you talk to God, but her? ﻿You know very well she liked it. ﻿She was happy, she felt fulfilled. ﻿That's what you can't stand, that she was happy. ﻿What a load of bull. ﻿She didn't even want to see you. ﻿Your self-centeredness drives me crazy. ﻿Either you're blind ﻿or you're pretending, ﻿but Mom stayed in touch ﻿and even came to see me and the girls the first of every month. ﻿Baloney. She never went out. ﻿You're a liar. -She sure did. ﻿She came all the way to Jerusalem. ﻿She told you she was going to Jerusalem for tests ﻿so you wouldn't freak out at her. ﻿You're a liar. ﻿You abused her all her life! ﻿It's your fault she died! ﻿Come, come. ﻿Come here. ﻿Come. ﻿That's my dad. ﻿My dad. ﻿Come, come. ﻿Come! ﻿Come, come! ﻿Come, Yehuda, let's go home. ﻿Dance with me. ﻿Dance with me. Dance with me. ﻿Dance with me. ﻿This is my dad. This is my dad! ﻿My dad! ﻿It's cold! ﻿My friend. ﻿No credit cards. Only cash. ﻿Crisis. ﻿No credit card? -Only cash. ﻿They don't take credit cards. ﻿What'll we do now? Drive on fumes? ﻿Don't you have any money left? ﻿Drive. -Where? ﻿Drive, I said. ﻿Drive. ﻿Theodoros is now 87. ﻿He had a stroke ﻿and came right here. ﻿He has been here for 8 years. ﻿He has a son, Thasos. ﻿At first he used to come visit, ﻿but for the past two years he has not sent any money, ﻿he has not come visit, ﻿so that's a problem. ﻿There is a crazy debt, almost 20,000 Euros. ﻿20,000 Euros? -Yes. ﻿His son, Thasos, he no visit his papa? ﻿No. No, no. ﻿There are many people here who nobody comes to see. ﻿Please. ﻿Theodore, ﻿it's me, Avraham, Avraham Kofinas. ﻿The son of Ethel and Haim Kofmas. ﻿Remember? ﻿He's responding just like he used to. ﻿The same wink in his right eye. ﻿He can't see you. ﻿He's almost blind. ﻿You must sit in front of him. ﻿I brought the deck of cards you gave me. ﻿So how do you know him? ﻿Theodoros? ﻿He hide me, ﻿Second War. ﻿We have to get him out of here tonight. ﻿What? ﻿Well find him a decent private hospital. ﻿I can't leave him here. ﻿We came this far, we did our best. ﻿It's all right. ﻿And no one will let us take him away ﻿without his son's permission. -I don't care. ﻿How will you get him out? ﻿We'll take him and leave. ﻿Without them noticing? ﻿They don't care. ﻿Where will you take him? -To his son. ﻿His son doesn't even visit him, and you want to take him to him? ﻿I don't get you. ﻿Did you come this far to help ﻿or to waste my time. ﻿Okay. -Okay. ﻿Let's take him back. ﻿It's still not too late. ﻿This is illegal. Do you realize what we're doing? ﻿Don't be hysterical. I spoke to the manager. ﻿Wait, what do you mean, you spoke to him? ﻿I mean you have nothing to worry about. ﻿Dear God! You bribed him? ﻿You bribed him. I knew it! ﻿It isn't bribery. ﻿Bribery is wrong. ﻿I'm cutting corners. ﻿Four, and... whoops. ﻿Whoops. ﻿Good morning. -Good morning.
