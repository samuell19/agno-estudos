[saxophone music] [gentle mysterious music] - Kate, Kate, get in here quick. - Doug, I was in the middle of a palm reading. I think she was gonna upgrade to the Premium Spirit Summoning package. - I think I just saw something in the crystal ball. - Oh, Doug. - No really, I can feel my powers returning. - Doug, did you ever really have any? - You doubt me? I mean, I was the amazing Rinaldi. I astounded people across this country with my mental skills, okay. Fortune telling, mind reading, hypnotism. - I know. I wrote the copy for the advertisement. But honestly, have you really had any insight? - You doubt me. - No. Just tell me what you saw. - I'm not really sure what I saw. I'm getting that feeling again, okay. Look, why don't we try this, okay? All right. The four of clubs? - Yes. - Really? [mysterious music] The eight of diamonds. - Right again. - Okay, one more. - The ace of spades. - You're amazing. - Okay, you know this means that I have to try hypnotizing. - No, hypnotizing never works out right for you. - Yeah, but that's before. Now I'm feeling it again. I'm feeling it. - No, it got us kicked out of the show in Cleveland. - Look, this isn't a show. You gotta let me at least try. [sighing] Okay. [mysterious music] Keep your eye on the watch. You're getting very, very sleepy. - Very, very sleepy. - When I snap my fingers, you will be completely under my command. - Under your command. [fingers snapping] - You find me irresistibly attractive. - Irresistibly attractive. - You have an uncontrollable urge to have sex with me. - Oh yes. [gentle music] [upbeat music] [saxophone music] - Oh, Doug, that was fantastic. - Thanks. Wait a second, you're still supposed to be under hypnosis. - Oh, well, I felt bad, so I faked it. - You were faking? - Only the hypnosis part. - Hey, look, the new stock came in. - [Doug] Throw all this junk away. - Junk? We paid good money for this stuff. Money we don't have, I might add. - We don't need it anymore. It's all trash. - Have you lost your mind? - Just read this. You remember my Aunt Bessie? - Yeah, the mystic healer who got you into all of this mumbo-jumbo. - Exactly, well, she passed away last week. - Oh, so much for the mystic healing. - Look, Aunt Bessie mighta been an eccentric, but she was also loaded. - Oh, too much liquor, huh? - No, the other kinda loaded. Filthy rich. - Really? - Uh-huh, she left us her mansion. - What? - That's right, baby, pack up your things. We're moving to Beverly Hills. [shrieking] [upbeat music] - This is just amazing. It's everything you said it would be. - Yep, it's completely furnished, and it's paid for. This is the life I always promised you, honey. - I could not be happier. [doorbell ringing] Hey, our first visitors. Hi. - We're your new neighbors. - We brought pie. - How lovely. Come in. Honey, these are our new neighbors. - Hi, I'm Peter Wells. This is my wife, Patricia. - It's nice to meet you. - Hi, I'm Doug Nelson, and you've already met my wife, Kate. - I'm George Hamwell. - And I'm Amy Hamwell, hello [chuckles]. - Why don't I get us some drinks? - Sounds great. - Yeah, sure. - And why don't you join me? - Oh, okay. - Okay. - George Hamwell, why does that name sound so familiar? - Well, I don't wanna be immodest, but perhaps you've seen one of my pictures. I'm a movie producer. - Hm, what movies have you produced? - Well, most know me from the Giant Slime Creature From Venus. - Nope, didn't see that one. - The Three-Eyed Monster From Planet X? - Don't think so. - Perhaps Scorpion Killer Versus the Giant Sasquatch. - Oh, I did see that one once. - Well there you go. - On the Late Late Late Show. - Yes. Well, Peter here is in the oil business. - Oh really? - That's right. West Star Oil. We operate some of the biggest offshore oil rigs in California. - [Doug] Really? That sounds exciting. - So what do you do for a living, Doug? - I used to have a little magic act. You know, card tricks, mind reading. Hypnotism. - Really? - Here we are. - Thank you. - Doug, Amy was telling me that George here is a movie producer. I used to be an actress myself. - Is that right? - Well, mainly background work, but I was on my way up when I met Doug. - Yes, and it's been all downhill ever since. Just a little joke, dear. [scoffing] - I was just telling Amy how great it is to live in Los Angeles. [gasping] - My dear, this is not Los Angeles. This is Beverly Hills. - Right. [throat clearing] - Well, Doug was just telling us that he used to be a hypnotist. - Oh he did, did he? Thought we weren't gonna talk about that. - Just sorta came out. - Anyway, I think it'd be great fun if he hypnotized one of us. - No, I couldn't. - Oh yes, yes, me, me, me, hypnotize me. - Okay, well, I guess I could give it a shot. - Yay! [soft piano music] Okay, um. Keep your eye on the watch. You're getting sleepy. - Sleepy. - Very sleepy. - Oh, I think it's working. - If you say so. - Now when I count to three and snap my fingers, you'll be in a deep, deep sleep. One. Two. Three [snaps fingers]. [soft piano music] - Well, Doug. - Doug, I think you actually did it. - Nope, just kidding [laughs]. Sorry, guys [laughs]. - I thought so. - Oh well, better luck next time. - Yeah, there are just, there are too many distractions going on right now. - Sure, sure, sure, sure. Hey, look, we've gotta be going. Welcome to the neighborhood. - Yes, we should be on our way as well. Listen, Doug, Peter and I have a golf game scheduled next week. You should join us. Do you play? - Golf? Yeah, of course I do, I play. - And how about you, Kate? What are you doing tomorrow? How about a shopping spree, just us girls? I have to introduce you to the shops on Rodeo. - That would be great. - Yay. - Well, thanks for coming over. It was really great to meet you guys. - Yeah. - Bye-bye. - Bye. - Bye. [door opening and closing] - Really, Doug? - What was I supposed to do? You saw. Guess I gotta go get some golf clubs now. [gentle music] - Thank you. I'm telling you, Peter, there is something about those two. - They seem perfectly normal to me. - Normal for Topeka, maybe, but they just don't seem like our kind of people. - Well they're showbiz types. They're bound to be a bit eccentric. - George is in show business. It's a legit show business. But hypnotism, really? - You're just being fussy. I'm sure everything'll turn out all right. - Maybe. - Now, how about you and I get upstairs and have a little fun? - Oh, Peter. I have a splitting headache. - Yes, the longest continuous headache in the history of mankind. - Shouting won't help, dear. Good night. [mysterious music] - Hey, you know, I think I'm gonna ask Doug if he wants to invest in my next picture. - Are you sure that's a good idea? I'm not sure they have that kinda money. - Well that house isn't cheap, even in today's market. They have to have some money. - Well you probably have to give his wife a role. Don't think I didn't notice how she happened to mention that she was an actress after you mentioned you were a producer. - And don't think I didn't notice you drooled at the sight of her husband. - Aw, is my man jealous? - Always. - Well, he was super cute, and I wouldn't mind a tussle with that wife of his, either. But right now, I wanna take care of you. - You vixen. [laughing] - Mm. [soft romantic music] - Thank you so much for taking me around today. - Oh no problem. It is so nice to have someone new in the neighborhood. - Yeah, I'm sorry about that whole hypnotism thing yesterday. - Oh no, don't worry about it. It was all in good fun. You know, I never really believed in any of that stuff anyway. - Okay, good. - You know, Kate, George and I would like to meet with you and Doug some evening. We may have a proposition for you. - Oh my gosh. Amy, okay, I'm super flattered, and I've heard about these Beverly Hills open marriages, but I don't think it's something that Doug and I are really into. - No, I meant a business proposition. - Okay, I'm embarrassed. [laughing] - But now that you mention it, keep an open mind. [birds singing] [knocking on door] - Coming. - Are you Doug Nelson? - Yes. - The Doug Nelson who is related to Elizabeth Nelson? - Elizabeth? You mean Aunt Bessie? - Aunt Bessie? Yes, she's the one. - You knew Aunt Bessie? - Oh, I knew her quite intimately. - I see. - Doug, when your aunt passed away, she left instructions for me to deliver this to you. - What is it? - The answer to your dreams. - Okay, again, what is it? - Many people considered your aunt a hoax, a charlatan, a snake oil salesman dressed in a skirt, if you would. Perhaps the same has been said about you. - Well, everything except the skirt part. - Oh, yes, of course. But Elizabeth was much more than that. She truly knew the mystic secrets of ancient Tibet. And the power of hypnotism. - Look, I've been through this all before, okay. I don't wanna get run outta Beverly Hills like I was run outta Cleveland. - Oh, you misunderstand me, my boy. This is the genuine article. With this jewel, you will be granted the power of hypnosis that you have always wanted. - Sure. - I see that you don't believe me. Very well. All I ask is that you try it before you dismiss it. But beware, the power of the jewel can be corrupting. - Whatever you say, man. - Douglas, don't take this lightly. With great power comes great responsibility. You must always use the jewel for good. And never for evil. - Well, thanks for the tip. But you should probably be going now. I'm really busy here. [soft music] - Good day, madam. - Good day. - Sorry about that. - Who was that? - Just a door-to-door salesman. - Hm, we're not supposed to have those types around here. - I'm sure he won't be back. What can I do for you? - Well, I hate to impose on a new neighbor and all, but I am making dinner tonight, and I ran out of cooking sherry. So, I was hoping that you would have some. - You know, the place was fully stocked when we moved in, so I'm not sure. Why don't we go take a look? - Thank you. [light music] - I'm just gonna check in the kitchen cabinet over here. - Okay. [light music] Hm. [light music] - I'm sorry. It looks like we don't have any cooking sherry. - That's okay. - But. I do have this. [mysterious music] You are now under my command. - I am under your command. - Holy cow, it works. - Touch your nose. Jump up and down. Cluck like a chicken. [imitating chicken] Okay, Patricia, here's what we're gonna do. From now on, when you hear somebody say wait three times, you're gonna have the uncontrollable urge to have sex with that person. - I will have an uncontrollable urge. - Okay, wake up [snaps fingers]. - Doug, what? - I'm sorry, we don't have any cooking sherry. - I'm gonna go. - Okay. Wait, wait, wait. [romantic music] - Come here, you big hunk of a man. [upbeat music] [moaning] - You will forget all about this encounter. - I will forget. [fingers snapping] - Good. - Honey, I'm home. - Hi, sweetheart. - Hey. Oh, Patricia, what are you doing here? - I, um. - Patricia came by to see if we had any cooking sherry, but we don't. - Right. - So she's gonna be going now. - Right. - Well, it was great to see you. - Yeah, goodbye. - That was strange. - Yeah, you know, crazy neighbors. So, what's with all the stuff? - Amy took me shopping. - Did you have to buy the entire store? - Honey, if we're gonna live in this neighborhood, with these friends, it's what's expected. We're just gonna have to figure out a way to make some serious money, fast. - No, I can't. - You know, Doug, I'd love to talk to you sometime about investing in my next production. - Oh, aren't movies a risky investment? - With my track record, hardly. Besides, Peter's investing. - That's right, gotta figure out what to do with all that oil money. - So what kinda money are we talking about here? - Hardly much at all. I just need to fill some gaps in the budget. Just a million or two. - Oh, is that all? [birds singing] - Sorry you had such a bad day, Doug. If I didn't know better, I'd say you'd never played golf before in your life. - Yeah, I can't remember the last time I saw anyone shoot a 200. - Over par. - Just unlucky today, I guess. - What's this? One of your mystical hoohas? - No no, wait, don't mess with that. [mysterious music] - What? What just happened? Peter, Peter. What have you done? [soft music] - Now I've done it. - [Kate] We're just gonna have to figure out a way to make some serious money, fast. - Tell me all your secrets for making money that nobody knows. - I take millions from investors and make shitty movies for peanuts. - Wait a minute. That's a project you wanted me to invest in? - Yes. On paper, they cost millions. In reality, I spend hundreds. - Doesn't anybody ever catch on? - With a title like Invasion of the Swamp People, no one expects much. - And what do you do with your money? - It's all in an offshore account. Cayman Islands, great place to do business. - And Peter's in on this too? - No, I'm gonna take his money as well [laughs]. - Oh really? Hm. [fingers snapping] - What the hell just happened? - Well, Georgie boy, you know I'm a hypnotist. - Yeah, but I thought a lousy one. - Apparently not. I had you under just now, and you told me some rather interesting things. - It was a college thing. Everyone experimented. - No no, not that. About your cheapo movies and your fake investments and your offshore accounts. - Oh, damn. - So, unless you want me to spill the beans to Peter over here, or go to the cops, I think you and I need to come up with some kinda payment arrangement. - You're blackmailing me? - You're cheating your investors. - Good point. All right, Nelson, what do you want? - You know, I think two million dollars doesn't sound unreasonable. - It's damn unreasonable. - You didn't say that this morning. You said two million dollars was hardly anything at all. - Yes, but that was your two million. - And it will be mine, once you give it to me. - Well I guess I have no choice. - Now you're talking. - Oh, sorry, I didn't know it was that valuable. - That's okay, just a family heirloom, you know. - Well gosh, guys, I gotta get home to the little woman. - I gotta get going too. Let's do this again sometime. - Matter of fact, why don't we do it tomorrow? Why don't we all get together and have a few drinks? You guys can bring the wives. - Sounds good to me. We'll be there. - Yeah, great. - We'll see you. - Okay. - I can't believe it. I just can't believe it. That bastard. That lowlife, dirty, rotten, stinking. - George, George, who are you talking about? - That new idiot neighbor of ours. - Slow down, slow down. What happened? - We were golfing today, right? - Right? - And I was gonna ask Doug about investing in the new Swamp People movie. - Right. - Well, we get back to Doug's place. - No, no, wait, don't mess with that. - What just happened? - Tell me all your secrets for making money. - I take millions from investors and make shitty movies for peanuts. - I think you and I need to come up with some kinda payment arrangement. - And he wants two million dollars. - That son of a bitch. And to think I was gonna have sex with him. - Yeah. Wait, what? - Nothing, nothing. I bet that tramp wife of his is involved too. - I can't believe someone's trying to blackmail me, me. - So are you gonna pay? - Hell no, you know all of our assets are tied up in those offshore investments. I couldn't even lay my hands on two million in cash if I wanted to. - So what are we gonna do? - You know, I've got just the thing. [mysterious music] - What's that? - Oh nothing, just something left over from the shop. - Oh, right, well, good night. - Hey, Kate? - Mm. - Did you mean it when you said we had to find a way to make a lotta money? - Well, honey, we live in Beverly Hills, and I know we own the house outright, but keeping up with these housewives is gonna be expensive. - What if I can't find a way? - You always find a way. I have faith in you. Plus, I'm worth it. - Great. [upbeat music] - Are you sure we're in the right place? - Yes, this is the right place. - I've never been in a place this seedy before. - I met you in a place like this. [soft music] - So how do you know this guy anyway? - He was recommended to me by some friends. - Who recommends hitmen? - I have a list of references, if you'd like to see them. - No no, that's quite all right. Carmine. - Yeah. - I'm George Hamwell. - Aint that nice. - Well you may have heard of me. I produce movies. - Really, which ones? - Well the Giant Slime Creature From Venus. - Nope. - The Three-Eyed Monster From Planet X. - Never heard of it. - Scorpion Killer Versus-- - George. - All right, it's not important. I've got a job for you. - Did you bring the cash? - 50,000, just like you asked. - I'm assuming I don't have to count this. - I don't think he can count. - No no, it's all there. - Who's the guy you want iced? - His name is Doug Nelson. Here's the address. - Okay. [soft music] You and I will never see each other again. You, however, I will see in my dreams. - Ew. Hm. [soft music] [suspenseful music] [sighing] - Peter, Peter, Peter. I heard something. I heard something downstairs. - Hm, what? - Downstairs, I heard something. - You're just having one of your anxiety attacks. Go to sleep. - No, Peter, seriously. - Sleeping pills in the medicine cabinet. - Oh. [mysterious music] - Ow, ow, hey, wait, wait, wait! - I have an uncontrollable urge to have sex with you. - Excuse me. - Shut up and take your clothes off. Come here. Oh. - You're something. I've waited for someone like you all my life. [soft music] [moaning] - Oh. I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me. - No need to apologize, baby. You're a sexual dynamo. Inside that prim and proper was a wildcat waiting to get out. - Yeah, I know. Wait a minute, who are you, and what are you doing in my house? - Oh yeah, I forgot. I'm here to kill your husband. - You're here to kill Peter? - Doug. - Doug? Doug Nelson? - Yeah. - Doug doesn't even live here. [papers rattling] - 7212 Maple Lane? No. This is 7221. - Oh, George is an idiot. He must be dyslexic or something. - George? George Hamwell? - That's the guy. - Why would George wanna kill Doug? - I don't know. It's an investment scheme or something gone wrong. I don't care, baby. I don't care about that. All I care is about you. - Don't, don't, don't. Down, boy. - But I gotta have you. - Ts, ts. All in due time. Wait a minute. If George is up to what I think he's up to, I think I might be able to use your help. You up for that? - I would do anything for you. - Oh. I'm Patricia, by the way. - Carmine. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. [soft music] - [Kate] Hey, thanks for coming. - Oh, we wouldn't miss it. - Oh, Amy, George. How nice to see you both. - Patricia. - How have you been? - Oh just peachy. - Hello, George. - Peter. - I must say, Patricia, you're looking particularly vibrant today. - Oh really? Must be this new face cream I have. - Oh well, whatever it is, I want some [laughs]. - No. - Sorry. - I mean, I think I'm almost out. - Hey, be careful, Doug, if I know George, he'll have you investing in his movie before you're finished with the first round. - Oh, I don't think so. - He says all he needs is a couple more million. - Yeah, two million dollars, hardly anything at all, right? - Well I wouldn't say that. - But you did say that. - You did. - Perhaps I was a bit hasty, okay. It is a substantial amount of money. But a good investment. - Oh, I'm sure it is. - Well, in any case, maybe George can give you a few pointers on the golf course, huh? - Sure, anytime. - Patricia, is everything okay? - What? Oh, yeah. Excuse me, Kate, can you tell me where your restroom is? - Yeah, it's down past the bedroom. - Oh, thank you. [soft music] - That was odd. - Yes, it was. Excuse me. - Sure. [soft music] - What took you so long? - I had to wait for Amy and George to get here. Now, you're gonna stick with the plan, right? - The plan? Yeah, the plan. I intimidate George into revealing that he hired me to kill Doug. - And that he's ripping off my husband. - Right, right. You know, that's not much of a plan. - He's right. [gasping] - Sic her, Carmine. - Wait. Wait, wait! - Oh, mm. [soft music] - Boy. [soft music] - So, Peter, tell me about the oil business. It sounds fascinating. - Well, there's not that much to tell really. You know what they say. Oil is money. - Is that what they say, really? - Sure, yeah, black gold, Texas tea. Except in my case it's more like California latte. [laughing] - Well I'm glad to hear that you're doing so well. - Oh, quite well. - Oil's well that ends well. - Well, looks like everyone could use a new drink. George, do you wanna help me in the kitchen? - Uh, yeah, sure. - Okay. - Hm. - Listen, Kate, whatever your husband has told you, it's not true. - Actually, I wasn't really here to talk about my husband. - You're not? - No. I was wondering if you could possibly cast me in your next movie. - Oh, oh, well. I can certainly consider it. - I mean, it doesn't have to be a big part. The female lead is fine. - Well, you know I do all my own auditions. - Mm-hm. I'm ready. - Well action. [soft saxophone music] - I wonder what's keeping everybody. - I don't know. Oh, Kate. - Hey, I'm right here, Doug. - Weren't you getting drinks? - Oh. - The drinks can wait. I have something far more important. - What is it, honey? - Carmine. - Carmine? Amy, what's going on? - George, just listen. Go ahead, Carmine. - As unaccustomed as I am to making speeches. - Just get on with it, dear. - [clears throat] Okay, that guy right there paid me to kill that guy. - Me? - No, no, no, Carmine. Remember? - Oh, I meant that guy. - Me? - Yeah, you gotta work on your penmanship, dude. - George, what's going on? - That's what I'd like to know. - I have no idea what this lummox is talking about. - Lummox? Lummox? What's a lummox? - Just get on with it, dear, okay? Mm-hm. [choking] - Okay, okay, okay, my whole movie investment is a scam. - What? - I really don't even have a movie project. My last film did so poorly no one'll finance me. - Are you serious? So I slept with you for nothing? - Well I had fun. - Excuse me. - Later, honey. - Keep talking. - Doug was blackmailing me, threatened to tell Peter I was stealing his money. - Excuse me. - Later, honey. - I spent all my money on my last film. I don't have a dime to my name. - Oh, sweetie. - What about the 50 G's you paid me? - Good think you didn't count it. [laughing] - I don't see what's so funny. - Oh my. All of this trouble for nothing. The joke is on all of you. My oil wells have been dusters for months. My company filed bankruptcy last week [laughs]. I'm dead broke. - Oh, you jerk. I can't. Why you? - Doug, you have to do something. - Okay. [upbeat dramatic music] - What the? - It's this, okay? It's making me do evil things. We gotta get rid of it. - What is it? - Never mind. Just tell me that you love me. - Of course I love you. - Even if we have to leave all of this and go back to the psychic shop? - Sweetheart, honestly, I hate this place. And all these people. - Yeah, but you slept with George. - Oh, well, it was this evil doohickey thing. Its energies, they affected me too. - Okay, let's just get outta here. - Okay. [light music] [sighing] - Lesson learned. [light music] On to the next one. I suppose I should release you. No. [fingers snapping] - Hey, look, the new stock came in. [soft music] - I astounded people across this country with my mental skills, okay. Fortune telling, mind reading, hypnotism. [soft music] [imitating chicken] [soft music] - Oh yes, yes, me, me, hypnotize me! [soft music] - It's all in an offshore account. Cayman Islands, great place to do business. [soft music] - Oh yeah, I forgot. I'm here to kill your husband. [soft music] - Black gold, Texas tea. Except in my case, it's more like California latte. [soft music] - A hoax, a charlatan, a snake oil salesman dressed in a skirt. [soft music]
