Follow my instructions ...to bury me and you will be highly rewarded When you open the box, poisonous arrows will shoot out The map inside the box is a fake one and is poisonous It's to punish the crooks; The genuine map is in this small iron box Wei, there's something strange about this cave Looks like it has been set on fire not long ago That's precisely what third uncle said For 18 years... we have been unable to locate this villain Maybe he's back at his old hide-out; So we should take a look at Hua Shan... and see what the situation is at the cave I'm afraid third uncle may be right So do we report back to our master ...and get more people to help us? The two of us will go in and grab this villain ...and get the glory We could turn out lucky and get the treasure map But, Uncle Ju Cheng What's to be afraid of?

This is the treasure map of the place they mentioned He wanted people to explore the mystery of the manual ...before finding the treasure map Whoever gets this treasure, go to Shilang at Zhejiang Find a lady named Wen Yi & give her 100,000 worth gold Sounds exaggerating "To Teacher" I've written a letter to Teacher ...and have explained everything in it If Teacher comes back, or sends someone ...please give this letter to him Since I've practiced the Golden Snake kung fu, though I don't want treasure.

He is not my real brother My mom's name is Wen, this is my grandpa's home He is my cousin If I had a father and my own home I needn't suffer all this I think he is good to you ...and yet you are mean to him If I'm not mean to him He'll step out of line You're so childish, how old are you? I'm eighteen and must be younger than you I don't have a brother, let's be sworn brothers Shall we? Brother Wen, you're mad at me You despise me, why do you want me as a brother? When had I despised you? Come, let's swear as brothers here Brother You're my younger brother then It's late, let's go to sleep Don't wake aunty Let's share our bed here See you tomorrow Brother, someone's asking for gold outside Let's take a look It's from the Lungyou school Let's go and see Don't be so fierce. My brother is here Don't bother with this kid Let's talk to the people in charge Brother Qing, come quickly These people are mean and want gold What gold? This little thief He was snooping in my room and the next day the gold was gone If you didn't steal it who did Why didn't you catch me then? I was sleeping... and didn't see you But when I woke up... You didn't catch me red-handed You didn't even see me You only have yourself to blame How can you blame me? But as I searched There's a rumour that... followers of Shilang & Lungyou clans are both... fighting for some gold and ultimately Shilang took it How can you accuse me of stealing... without any proof? Then we'll search the place If we find the loots, you'll be in trouble The Wen family is rich We have lots of gold, not to mention just 2,000 How can you tell it's all yours? You get your gold... either by stealing or by robbing How can you... insult us from the Shilang Clan? Insulting you? You think you have good reputation I've never seen such... a hostile woman Then I'll let you taste... consequences of a woman's wrath! Brother, step back ...and let me make this clear I've a doubt that this lady is from Hua Shan school So what? Hua Shan is a righteous school and is different... from you thieves from Shilang I'm not from Shilang The Hua Shan School is not bad either Who is your teacher? My teacher is called Gui Xin Shu ...nicknamed the lnvincible Fist Good What's the third of the 12 rules of Hua Shan school? Who are you to query me? I'm from Hua Shan school too This kid is bluffing The three of us are also from Hua Shan school But we didn't know you Brother Chui, he's the new student of Uncle Wang Teacher hasn't recruited any student for a long time Uncle Wang has good judgment How could he recruit you as his student? Right, the judgment of Brother Wang... is naturally smart You still haven't answered me What's the third of the twelve Hua Shan rules? Who are you calling brother Wang? My teacher's name is Muk Ren Qing ...and is known as the magnificent sword Wang Zhen is my elder brother Then you are our uncle I dare not put it this way Are we not good enough? This lady still hasn't answered me You want to lecture us If the second brother is here He will surely lecture you You are talking nonsense Did second brother ever tell you... what the twelve rules are when you first came? Alright, I'll answer your question The third rule concerns killing of the innocent Then you know; let me ask you ...what wrong has that kid done Even if it is the fault of Shilang school He's only 16 or 17, and what has it to do with him? In a strike that lady has cut his arm; Isn't this violating the rule? The Hua Shan people are here Let's wait and hear what they have to say Oh, you want to teach others a lesson But don't forget... We haven't acknowledged you as our senior yet So what does it take for you to acknowledge me? You have to show us how good you are ...and whether you're worth it? They'll have a fight It'd be good to witness the kung fu skill of this kid Brother Yuan, come over here This is my grandpa and my uncle Nan Yang Fourth uncle Bai Yang and fifth brother Wen Fang Nice to meet you Please don't stand on ceremony Qing said that your martial arts is exceptional ...and it's true Let me try your Hua Shan school's kung fu This technique is 'worshipping the Guan Yin' right? You have used our school's technique I would like to know Are you aware she has transgressed... sixth rule also? The sixth rule : Not to be disrespectful to elders Who knows who you are! How can I make you believe I am your uncle? I want to spar with you If you are better than I am... and you can take five attacks from me; Then regard me as an impostor It's agreed. I'll count This is my first strike, you ready Okay Here it comes Why didn't you believe me? Why would I lie to you? You can't block me with a single palm ...use both hands For the other three strikes they'll be continuous How do you tackle my "Thunder Hand", "Throwing a stone" ...and "Monkey wags its tail"? I will use "Closed hand", " Cloud behind mountain" and "Break a willow branch" You got the first two right, but not the last one This technique requires defence & simultaneous attack But when you defend, the power is reduced If the opponent is weak then the effect is good ...but you can't tackle my last strike Then I'll use the 'thundering earth' technique Right, let's go Thundering earth It's good you didn't meet me head-on My elder brother has taught his student well My fifth move is the start of the Broken Jade fist You'd think the first move is merely ceremonious ...and not effective against an opponent Our great master developed every move ...for a focused attack. Watch I'm sorry for being impolite, uncle Please accept my respects Please arise We're almost the same age; no formalities please Yes Brother Mui, try his swordsmanship Okay I want to test your sword skills Okay Brother, get me ten swords Get ten swords here Yes Your friend's kung fu is really good I'll use this broken sword, come on You look down me. Don't blame me for your death I've prepared ten swords for you Get another one Why such a treacherous move? There's no need to fight anymore You said you are the student of our school... yet don't even know such a technique And said it was treacherous move This is our school's swordsmanship, do you know that? This is called "The worm attached on the bone" Yes, despite its name ...it is very effective Lets have a sword duel Your skills are too mixed These are all typical of our school's style Why you said that? On guard Do you want to try again? Do you still want to fight? Do you acknowledge defeat? Uncle Yuan, we failed to recognize you Please forgive brother Mui You admit you're wrong? Yes You should know ...you have broken two of our rules The sixth commandment is you should respect seniors The 3rd commandment is one shouldn't kill the innocent Ms. Suen has transgressed She will apologize for her mistake An apology is not good enough The school's rule has been broken... Our uncle shall deal with it But it's all because you robbed the gold So what about that? Right, what's all this about the gold? We were following orders... to deliver the gold to help victims of misfortune The gold was robbed so I pursued I knew it was the Shilang School which did it Then I met Brother Mui and Ms. Suen ...and we joined together to claim back the gold Brother, he is rash But for my sake... Iet that kid's wound heal first I'll teach him one-armed sword techniques ...to make up for it, what do you think? As for the gold; since it is for... my teacher to help victims of misfortune, ...we should return it to him Returning the gold is small matter But she must lose an arm as well I'd like to see you try You think I don't dare Whose side are you on anyway? You are my sworn-brother ...she is my junior Lady... You think she is pretty And you defend her even though she's wrong A few thousand taels of gold isn't a big deal I'll give all of it to you if you want But they have to give up an arm in exchange We're all angry... and we can't clear up the matter Maybe Brother Cui can come around tomorrow ...and I'll return the gold Let's go then When you come tomorrow... Don't forget to give me this girl's arm Brother, the gold is meant for victims of disasters We ought to return it to them Ms. Suen has made a mistake but she is my second brother's student If we punish her... I'll have to answer to my second brother Anyway, you're still on her side Alright, Qing...enough For the sake of Brother Yuan ...the gold has to be returned There's one thing that must be clarified though You are saying... It goes without saying ...your Hua Shan's kung fu is great But the technique you used to... separate Qing Er and the other girl; It all doesn't look like it's from Hua Shan Well, these are some moves I learned elsewhere Keen observation, I must say It comes with age and experience Nan Yang You spar with Brother Yuan ...and spar with control Yes Please teach me You're too kind Uncle, do you recognize... I cannot say for sure what his skills are like Let's try his weaponry skills Nan Yang, quit Thank you Uncle, look... Talk later Your punches and kicks are good Jing Er Try Brother Yuan's weaponry skills There's a hint Fang Er Go and help Jing Er Yes Grandpa Fang Er, stop That's enough Brother Yuan's skills are matchless I'm here to try his skills Grandpa, we're sworn brothers Don't hurt him Let's see Brother Yuan, come on Allow me then What... Who is this kid... Mom Please make your move Please lend me this wooden sword Alright? I dare not use real weapons so I am using this wooden sword Quite thoughtful of you! The skilled artists can afford to take risks Right, let's go The golden snake bandit sent you Where is the bandit? speak up Please, be calm I sure can make out Apart from Hua Shan kung fu... you also know Master golden snake's techniques That's why I want them to spar with you You think I'm too old to observe this How are you related to Golden-Snake Hsia Shiue Yi? Why did he send you? I have never seen him; how could he have sent me? Is this true? Why should I lie to you? I was at Huichow... and met Mr Wen accidentally He appreciated my skills so we became brothers What has this to do with the golden snake? If you don't tell us where the golden snake is ...you'll not leave here today I am not related to him in any way I haven't even seen him Yet I know where he is But I don't think anyone here dares to go & see him Says who? We have been looking for him these ten odd years Quick, tell us where he is You are in good health you've waited a few years before you could see him He's dead already Mom Great misfortune Mom, mom Qing Qing, help your mom inside Don't let others laugh at you What's to be ashamed? When she knew father's dead ...naturally her heart is broken Who is your father? The kid's talking nonsense By tomorrow I want all the gold kept here Let Yuan and the Hua Shan people get it Mom Ask Yuan to the backyard tonight I have something I want to ask him Go quickly Mom Excuse me Wait I have something to ask you Where did the golden snake die? Who saw him die? I didn't see that Well, in any case we must solve this 'gold' issue I'll come again tomorrow Brother Qing Brother You... I am in fact a girl I have kept this from you I have been so dumb I've never come across a girl in the mountains I should have discovered this earlier I am Wen Qing Qing I left one 'Qing' out of my name It should be Hsia Qing Qing in fact My mom has something to ask you, come Greetings You're too kind Please sit He's...really dead Did he die a painful death? I don't know I found his skeleton by chance ...and buried him It was sort of a master-student relationship I learned a lot from him I have waited eighteen years ...for him to take us away from here Who would know he'd go first! May I ask what is your maiden name? Is it Yi? Right, how did you know?... Did he write it in his will, ...did you bring it? Who's there? Uncle, we are chatting here How could you eavesdrop? You don't behave like a senior So shameless! You have an affair with a man... and now you teach your daughter to do the same Uncle, mind what you say You shameless bitch I am in a position to rule over you Besides, third uncle asked to; dare you disobey? It looks like no one here ...regards us as family Brother, he saved your life You have a modicum of gratitude Who'd have known people of the Wen family ...to be so ungrateful! It is true he saved my life but why did he do it If you remember, speak Alright Twenty years ago in Yangchow I was caught by the law What offence did you commit? I am a man, I dare to speak out I was going to rape a girl ...and was caught I was sentenced to death Fourth Uncle just happened to be in Yangchow then He was supposed to come and save me ...but he didn't; Instead the villain came ...and saved me out from the prison The two arrived at a deserted temple at the outskirts What's your name please? You need not ask Anyway, you won't thank me for this later This is Fourth Uncle's weapon True, I saved you because of your Fourth Uncle ...who is a good friend of mine Take this box back... to be opened by your father or uncle If you don't do as told and lose the treasure inside ...or commit crime again; That's what will happen to you This is your travel expense I'll come to your home in a month's time What's fourth brother been doing? What's inside this box?! Open it "To the Wens brother of Shilang School" Brother Fourth Uncle Isn't he malicious? Why does he do this, say it Whatever your spouse does, you'll think they are good Well, he's my husband. In my heart he is my husband Qing Qing, I was young at that time ...and my family is devious I don't like them That day I heard noise of squabble in the living room ...and went out I heard your grandpa reading out that letter The Wen's brother of the Shilang school Herewith is the corpse of your fourth brother Ming Luk Take it...years ago ...after he raped and killed my sister, he also killed ...my parents and my brother I escaped alone and swore vengeance I must kill 50 in your family ...and ravish 10 of your women ...to vent out my deep hate From Hsia Shiue Yi the Golden Snake Good, if he would only come Tell everyone... especially women, not to step out from their rooms We'll lead a team of kung fu fighters to patrol, to prevent this villain from killings How many has he killed? Twenty-one While escaping, the villain said that... the 2 women who had been kidnapped last time... ...have been sold to a whorehouse in Yangchow Send some men to Yangchow ...and search all the brothels Yes Why don't you do ...as you were told? I'm so bored What's wrong with playing around... ...in one's own courtyard? The Golden Snake is here, come Thirty-eight It'd have been better if I had been hit to death But he saved me at risk to his own life Drink You've to eat something I don't want to I thought you were a mute I'm not. I just don't want to talk to bad guys Tomorrow is the death anniversary of ...my parents, brother and sister I must kill one of your family member to avenge them; Nothing will keep me away! The next day, he went and killed He was followed by dad and his men Father along with Big, 2nd & 4th Uncle and his son Fifth Uncle's son Xi Yang and Chung Yang ...have all come Father Are you alright?

I've a treasure map That was when Shing Cho usurped the throne Emperor Kin Man escaped with some treasure ...and buried it all in a secret place in Nanking Emperor Shing Cho could never find ...but I've accidentally come across I never got to find them because I have to seek vengeance Now I don't have to do this anymore Tomorrow I'll bring you home and go to... find the treasure; after that I'll come look for you He didn't want to leave me I didn't want to leave him either But... I couldn't stay with him just like that When I went home, everyone looked down on me They couldn't protect their own daughter When I came back unharmed ...they insulted me instead I didn't bother with them ...and didn't talk to them either Shameless I've waited for him for 3 months One night, someone knocked at the window I knew it was him I opened the window and let him in We love each other so we had sex that night And then I bore you his child Open the door, I know someone's inside Don't worry, I can fight out I know about your affairs I'm grateful that you didn't kill me last time If we become family, we should forget about the past Relax, I've promised her not to seek vengeance Don't think of eloping with her Yi is my only child, she has to be married properly ...and cannot elope Otherwise she'll be looked down upon by other people Alright So you'll stay and we will prepare for the wedding I've never thought that... my own parents will...

I've never talked to anyone from the Wen family I shouldn't have stayed here in the first place But since I was with child where else could I go? I just hope that he's not dead ...and will come back for us If I leave... where else can he find me? Now that he's dead, what do I need to be afraid of? I'm not afraid of them, are you?

Kill me. Torturing people is no heroism I've heard that you've found a treasure Where's the treasure map? Treasure is nothing, take it all Release me and I'll give them to you Alright They cut off the veins and sinews of his arms ...and forced him to give them the treasure map He's not been seen ever since He would've escaped... and they did not get the treasure map You bitch, you traitor, you'd better be careful I'm just telling the truth Someone ought to know of the Golden Snake's misdeeds He's dead, what am I to be afraid of? Alright This bitch has mentioned about... the Five-Element Array of our Wen family If you have the guts, come and try it Mr Yuan, you'd better leave. Don't fight with them Not knowing if the Golden Snake was dead or alive they came back & practiced hard the 5-Element Array Although Big Uncle and Second Uncle were dead Nan Yang and Bai Yang's kung fu progress a lot The grandson of Second uncle Wen Jing... Fifth uncle's grandson Wen Fang aren't bad either They've practiced the Bagua Array too You've said enough Do you dare to come with us?

Wen's family must have done a lot of bad things ...to have traitors in the family The Wens have been charitable; repairing roads and aids to the poor They do all the good things... They won't steal, kill or plunder Nan Yang, never mind her. Watch this guy Alright You win, return the gold to you guys from Hua Shan You take it and leave. If you can't win... Shut up and bring the gold If I knew... I should have given them the gold yesterday Please try me Teacher, look...the gold is here Give us back the gold Wait I, Yuan Cheng Chih is pleased to meet you Rise, please arise I've heard that Teacher has got a young student and didn't actually expect to meet you here Don't be impolite, bow to uncle Uncle You're too kind Where are Mui Jin and Suen Chung Kwun? They were taught a lesson ...and went away I know that I'm not good enough... that's why I've invited Teacher to come along This is Wang Zhen ...from the Hua Shan School This must be Master Wen My student is inexperienced... and have lost the gold for victims Master Wen, for the sake of refugees at least ...please return the gold I'll be highly obliged We've already agreed with your brother Our Shilang is famous for the Five-Element Array If he can defeat us, we'll give you back the gold My little brother... is almost the same age as your grandchildren Why do you have to make it difficult for him?

Let me try then Big brother, you are our chief Please let me try You take over if I fail Brother, I believe that... you have learnt a lot from Teacher But you are not experienced enough Let me deal with it while you watch the Array for me Wait till you have solved it then we can hit it I'll take this challenge Are you going to fight with me?
