The job of a bouncer or a bodyguard l don't get a word of what you're saying That's exactly what l love about you. You don't get anything at all All right, l'll explain Now look at this and this... carefully what happened? A clap, right? lt happened when this hand and this hand came close together You're one hand, l'm the other we ought to meet like that Radhe's using philosophy to reason with her You must be wondering whether my folks will accept you, isn't it? But you needn't worry. They are very orthodox, no doubt But if l don't eat for a day or two, everything will be all right lf your father creates any trouble, right under his ear, on the neck... l'll give him a tight slap Fifteen days after our marriage, he won't know where he is You heard what l said? That's full and final Yes That... "O ascetic..." "l've fallen in love with you" "l've fallen in love" "My eyes yearn to see your face" "My eyes yearn to see you, l shed tears when l miss you..."

Throw them in the jeep! Sit down l raised my hand at you. Please forgive me what's your husband's name? where does he work? His name is Atmaram. He works at the Public works Department l'm asking for the file, can't you see? lt's right there. Go and get it well? what is it? who are you? what are you doing? Listen to me... what the hell are you doing? why won't you listen to me? Sharmaji... My glasses? why're you slapping me? lf you raise your hand, l'll give you a thrashing Enough! Stop it... what mistake have l made? why're you hitting me? My hands did the talking. Now l'll explain Go and bring your wife back tomorrow morning Else, you'll get four slaps at breakfast and eight at dinner. Okay? lf you don't treat her well, l'll have to visit you again Ponytail... what are you doing here? Do you know that man, Radhe-ji? - No, but that makes no difference Brother-in-law...? Sister, your husband is here with Rahul what happened to you? Nothing... it's just... Mummy... - Rahul! My son! Mamta, pack your bags. l'm here to take you back But the money hasn't been... - l don't want any money Forget all that and just come with me Nirjara, listen to me for a minute. - l have nothing to discuss with you what you think about me is not true.. - why are you bothering me? l don't want to listen to anything. Not a minute, not five... not today, not tomorrow, not ever! You hear that? "And don't you dare follow me!" You tease girls in the temple? what is your name? where do you live? Tell us your name! The name is Radhe. - Forgive me She went in that direction, you'll go in the other You offered the oil? - Yes lt's thanks to Him that my sister has settled down gain No, Nirjara. Mamta has settled down again not because of Him... she has settled down thanks to Radhe Your sister had landed in a brothel in trying to raise a loan Had Radhe not got there at the nick of the time... l don't know what calamity would have struck her Mamta herself told me about it He's the one who brought your brother-in-law to his senses which is why he quietly came and took Mamta back to his house Radhe didn't even know that Mamta is your sister just think. when a man, without any self-interest... helps save another person's family, is he a bad human being? Yes, l admit he's a bit hard and wayward For that matter, even God lives in idols of stone But don't we worship Him? The truth is that he loves you very much True love Think about it. Did he ever misbehave with you? Did he ever try to take advantage of you? He hasn't even touched you You must be wondering why l'm telling you all this lt's because l've realised... he's a far better human being than me Better than you, better than me, better than thousands of others He can even lay down his life for you which is why Radhe Mohan is your true companion for life Not me Take a look at me! Have you ever seen me like this? l used to be so happy! But ever since l've fallen in love with you... it seems as if my bad times have begun l thought people who gave up their lives for their love, were such fools But now l realise, why they do it Rather than suffer like me, they get their freedom in moments! But you needn't worry. l'm not dying Because, if l die... you will become a widow And l can't bear to see you being widowed The truth is... Enough! Enough! l feel like... Now look, Nirjara... l don't want to rape you l only want two minutes from you l want you to hear how l feel. That's it l want you to be happy. And smiling You get what l'm saying? Everyone in the world falls in love Am l the only one without a right to love someone... to have someone love me? well? we'll treat you like a queen l, my brother, my sister-in-law, Binti... and all my friends... That boy your father has chosen for you... l'm not saying he's not a good guy. He must be a nice chap Start calling him your brother. Or make a friend out of him l'll accept your friend l want to give the priest's daughter a nice life... and that priest wants to snatch my life from me? As if he's the priest, and l'm an untouchable! what future will you have with him? when l think of it, about you and him... it sends my head reeling. Like this! After listening to all this, you must surely realise... how dearly l love you? lf you still don't get it, l... l know what l'll do! Go away! Go away! Go away, else l'll kill you. Go! But what will l do with my life then? l don't want to live a moment without you Yes! l have forcibly brought you here! And yes, l'm indeed screaming at you! l'm threatening you! That's only because... it's because l love you very much Because l think you were made only for me... only for me You were born for me alone Ask your God! Ask Him! l'm going through so much of pain... so much of misery, God! Forgive me Do please forgive me "l've draped the scarf... l dance for you" "l drape the scarf and dance..." "for l have lost my heart" "l've fallen in love with you, l've lost my heart to you" "Your love gives me a high... l've lost my heart to you" "l've fallen in love with you, l've lost my heart to you" "l dance, l break every promise..." "Every promise, l break and dance today..." "My bangles speak, my anklets say..." "come with the bridal palanquin and take me away, my love" "with henna on my palms..." "bridal vermillion on my forehead..." "l'll dress up only for you, my love" "The Spring of my beauty is here... for l have lost my heart to you" "l drape the scarf today and dance for you" "ln your name l shall bequeath..." "this story of my realisation" "lf we are to unite, we shall unite..." "not to be separated for ages" "l have waited for years, my love" "Even in pining l found succour, my love" "l've lost my heart to you" "l've fallen in love with you, my heart is no longer mine" "Every promise, l break and dance today..." So you're going to make us shut down our business? You ought to have kept your bullying ways to your college Get up Nirjara, how can you go on like this? l want to meet him once. - what for? why're you unnecessarily bothering yourself? You don't understand, lndu. - l understand everything But is there any point in all this anymore? The sooner you get him out of your mind the better You understand? Let's go now. C'mon Get an injection! Quick! where has he gone? He has survived But neither can he understand anything nor recognise anyone lt's really very sad but every effort of ours... to bring about an improvement in Radhe's condition, has failed That's exactly why l wish to say something to you folks Of course. Please go ahead Although l'm a doctor, l still believe in God whenever l fall sick... my mother gives me oblations before any other medicines lt has to do with devotion, it defies logic Because prayers and medicines are both very important in our society Absolutely l was going to suggest something of the sort You must've heard of Sripurdham? Although medical science does not believe in it... Swami Sheelbhadra uses ancient cures to heal patients lf medical science does not believe it, why must you believe it? Do you know? Patients are bound in chains and treated worse than animals And you want to send Radhe there? - That's because... in a fit of violence, they shouldn't hurt themselves or anyone else whatever this boy just said is not wrong But it's also true that several patients like Radhe have been cured there lt has to do with faith and devotion You either have it, or you don't where is Sripurdham? just telephone them Their workers will come and personally take Radhe away what are you thinking of doing? what can we think of, Aslam? we'll have to send him there You take just about anyone's advise seriously! He spoke in our own interests. - Really? And what was that? To not take your brother back home? To hand him over to some crazy ascetic? So that he can try his mumbo-jumbo on him...? even if it leaves your brother dead? - Aslam! The doctor's trying to save his neck... and these folks don't want anyone to be a burden on them lf your brother is such a burden, don't take him home! l'll take him away. l'll look after him, l'll nurse him! But l'm not letting you send him to some ascetic's ashram! Let me tell you that. And you better listen to me! lnsolent! l'm the one who has pampered these boys. lt's my fault! Else, could anyone misbehave with you...? Gayatri, calm down He's upset because he loves Radhe so much Go and sit there Let him go. Maybe it's good for Radhe Look at me, Aslam l can't say whether l have understood Radhe But one thing l'm proud of... he has friends like you Forgive me, brother You know why l'm sending you to Sripurdham ? Because l'm fed up of you! That's it! l'm sick of your fights and brawls l'm tired of reasoning with you! l now want you to get out of my sight... so l can breathe easily! Do you hear that? what are you doing? Look... l've been scolding him. And he doesn't even talk back Radhe... l'll sit with you at the station henceforth we'll sit outside the college. we'll act like bullies... l'll join you too just get well... please get well Get well, please Sister-in-law... the van has arrived to take Radhe away "why does this happen in love?" "why does loyalty..." "not beget loyalty?" "why are good wishes..." "not answered with good wishes?" "why is happiness..." "not reciprocated with joy?" "what does this happen in love?" "Love makes you weep..." "it makes you forget the world" "lt makes you pine, it makes you restless" "what has love turned people into?" "They met their beloveds..." "and separated" "All they got was misery even in Spring..." "their lifetimes being spent, waiting for their beloveds" "why doesn't a smile beget a smile?" "why isn't loyalty greeted with loyalty?" "Time never comes to a standstill..." "you do not keep vigil on friends" "when medicines cease to heal..." "what does one do?" "why isn'tjoy greeted with joy?" "why isn't loyalty paid back with loyalty?" Chander... no one's telling me how Radhe is. where have they taken him? But you surely know? Girls are not allowed there But Radhe will be all right. Don't worry. l've put in a word to God and He too has told me... that Radhe will be all right Praise the Lord... See how ardently she is praying, Rameshwar l wonder who's ill Has she had something to eat? - No She's been praying since this morning. - This morning? Yes, a boy in her college is... - ls...? He's lying in the ashram at Sripur This girl is just like her mother She's been fasting and praying for a stranger He's no stranger, Guruji. - No...? That boy belongs to Nirjara's college and Nirjara... Yes? Go on. - She's in love with him Nirjara, is what Rameshwar saying... true? Yes, father Lord! l've committed no sin, father. l've done nothing wrong what is this if not wrong? Maybe that boy has done us favours He has helped your sister settle down again But will you entrust yourself to him for that? l already have, father l've given him my heart And my heart isn't outside my body what's going on? How can you afford to be so disheartened? l wasn't ever polite with him Don't worry He... he'll return soon Our Radhe will return. just you see Swamiji... Swamiji...! Rameshwarji... who is it? Rameshwarji... please take me to Radhe. just once l'll remain indebted to you all my life All right, we'll leave in the morning Mahantji... Nirjara has gone to Sripurdham with Rameshwar A boy from his college has been admitted there She said she would return by nightfall Here are the keys to your house The priest is here to meet you. - Priest? Yes, Nirjara's father You've seen what state he's in, haven't you? Do you think we didn't want to have a daughter-in-law like you? But perhaps that is not possible anymore Had my brother been all right... l'd have begged your father for your hand But to think of him now and to hope that he... it's futile. lt's over lt's all over The things man thinks of doing... and what turns out to be lt isn't right to think only of your happiness and cause anguish to others You know, your father has thought of nothing but your welfare He's the father who has given you life You mustn't be obstinate and drive him to death Give him his due, please when is it auspicious to hold the wedding, holy sir? Friday, july 10 is an auspicious date for the wedding lt's all over. Looks like Nirjara is going to be married to Rameshwar why're you hitting him? - He always talks nonsense! Radhe's not yet dead. He's just ill wait and see. He'll come back as soon as he gets well And when will that be? when? After the marriage is over? No, he'll come soon l have a feeling he's coming back soon where are you going? Get back there "Even in death, we shall not break our promise" "we will never part from each other" "Ours is a relationship spanning many births" "who has ever separated life from the body?" "without you..." "without you, this ocean has no shore, my love" "ln your name, l have bequeathed my entire life, my love" "My entire life, my love"
