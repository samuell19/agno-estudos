♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Sandy, you shouldn't try that thing on the admiral's barge. You say that again, you're gonna get your throat caught in this! [ Bell ringing ] Someday, you're gonna find yourself without anything to worry about. It's gonna worry you to death. Yeah, but I -- I know what we've invented. You think I'm nuts? Well, I ain't sure. Listen, non compos mentis, how long we been in this Navy together? Oh, about -- Never mind. No matter how long it is, you've made it seem longer. The point is that in 10 days, we'll be out of this damned Navy. Yeah, and I'd rather spend those 10 days out of the brig. [ Whistling ] Hey. Suppose this freak carburetor don't work. What do we tell the admiral? We won't have to tell him anything. He'll tell us. Oh, we'll get the brig for this. Oh, shut up. Turn her over. [ Engine sputtering ] [ Engine starts ] We're on our way to our first million. Yeah, million headaches. [ Whistling ] [ Whistling ] Listen. She's purring like a pussy. Hey, don't mention cats, will you? They're bad luck. Say, sailor, if this carburetor works out, we're gonna be on our feet. Yeah, and if it don't, we're gonna be on our... [ Explosion ] [ Bell ringing ] [ Bugle playing ] [ Siren wailing ] Abandon ship! Hey, Bumpy! Drop that fire extinguisher! Captain! What caused that fire? Uh, it didn't work. What didn't work? Well, you see, we, uh, we got a, uh, a thing we were gonna... Well, my advice to you is to forget this idea of a gas-turbine engine. It's as impossible as perpetual motion. We spent thousands in experiments, and if we can't make it work, nobody can, so let's don't waste each other's time in such nonsense. I don't think he wants it. Say, listen. Do you see that electric light? Yes. Edison. You see that telephone? Bell. You -- you -- you see that clock? Uh... Ingersoll. Yeah, and do you see that door? Scram. And, mister, through that door goes the greatest internal combustion engine since... Since Henry Ford invented the gin mill. Count 10, now, count 10. I can do what with it? You heard me! And you can do the same with this! Huh. I don't think he wants it. Oh, the poor dumb cluck. Just the same, that's gonna make us millionaires. But I don't want to be a millionaire. I want to eat. We got to get a meal ticket. I'm hungry. Don't you know someplace we could go? Well, there are the races at Tijuana. Are you a good judge of horse flesh? I never tasted any. [ Grunts ] 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10. Hmm. Just because I won't eat a horse. How -- how do you know we're gonna be able to get a job on one of these scows? Oh, don't worry. I have hunch that prosperity is just around the corner. Yeah, but we're on a merry-go-round. There ain't no corners there. Lay off the wisecracks. If you ever really started to work, you'd be too lazy to stop. Oh, is that so? Yeah. Well, why don't you pull the scow then? Sit down, will you? Now look what you've done. You in a rowboat, not a dance hall. Oh, you make me do all the work all the time. Well, what else are you good for? Well, I could eat if we had something to eat. Oh, come on. Row the boat, and I'll get the job. Pull on around there. Pull over this way. Grab hold of my hand. Did you swallow much water? I think I left some in there. Here, lean over. [ Laughing ] What's the matter? Oh, that tickles! Oh, don't be silly. Help! Help! Here, just a minute! Grab hold of that! Help! Go on. Get hold of that. Help. Help. I'm drowning. Help. Help. Help! Don't get panicky. I'll get you. Let go of me! Let go of me! Just let go of me! Oh! Let me help him. I'll help him. Grab him. Come on, pal. Come up here. Oh. I'm glad you didn't drown. Come on, lady. Let me help you up. Hold on. Whew. Woman, you sure pack a mean wallop. Come on, dear pal, while I first-aid you. Ugh. Ugh. Shirley: Oh, I'm sorry I had to hit him so hard. Remember, you're not 12 miles out. Oh, excuse me! Didn't I tell you prosperity was just around the corner? Yeah, but this ain't getting us a job. What?! Being run down by the wealthy classes? Bacteria, don't be silly. Back to what? Oh, come on. Follow me and do as I do. Come on. Oh, I hope you start eating. Mm, some boat. Yeah. That's a nifty, ain't it? Well... What do you mean by running over us and breaking up our boat? Do you think you own the ocean? Well, I -- I'm awfully sorry, honestly, but I didn't see you. Sorry? You think that's gonna square it? Well, of course, I'll do anything I can. I'll pay for your boat, and I'll put you ashore any place you say. Where were you going? Where are you going? Catalina Island. Where are you going? Catalina Island. In a rowboat? Oh, no, no, no. You're taking us. You said you'd put us ashore anyplace, didn't you? Why, yes, of course. Alright. Let's go. [ Engine rumbling ] What are you going to do? See that this tub gets to Catalina without hitting everything in the ocean. Hey, senseless. Who, me? But off the galley and hustle up some food. Oh, Skipper, you're marvelous. I hope they got some chicken or something. I like your nerve. That's a good start. Gradually, you'll like all of me. Bumpy: Hello, there, Beulah. Here. Don't you get tough with me. I'll eat you up. Chicken! Well, spank me naked. Say, it's pretty good old tub you got here. Know anything about boats? Know everything about boats. We was connected with the largest shipping line in America! What line? The U.S. Navy. I come from an old boating family. You do? Jameson? John D. Jameson, the builder of the famous racing boats? Yep, my father. Your father? Whew, what a break for him! We've got some speed he's gonna use. Ow! Ow! Take him off! Yeah! Hey! What? Ugh! Call your shots, will you? Financial statements you asked for, Mr. Jameson. Thanks. Well, there's the bad news, Clarence. Hmm. Think your bank can keep me out of receivership? We'll do our best. You know that. There's one thing the bank will insist on, though. You'll have to stop wasting thousands of dollars every year on these racing boats. What, give up the International Cup? Why, Clarence, where's your sporting blood, your patriotism? It isn't a question of patriotism, Mr. Jameson. It's a question of cold business necessity. Hey, what's this third item here? $10,000, notes past due. Oh. That's what Steve Oldham owes me for those speedboats I built for his concession at the pier. Steve Oldham? Yeah. Great Scott. Did you know that he skipped town last night and left a string of debts a mile long? Is that right? Right. Well, that's something else to worry about. Ooh, Skipper! I've had an accident! I ran down a rowboat and nearly drowned two sailors. Good grief, daughter! Oh, it's alright. I rescued them. One of them couldn't swim, so I had to go overboard and get him, and he put up an awful struggle, got frightened, you know, and I had to hit him terribly hard, poor fellow, and, Skipper, is he handsome! Here's something for you to look into, Clarence. Yeah, Shirley. Oh, hello, Clarence. I'm sorry I didn't see you. I guess I'm all excited. Yes, you must have had rather a thrilling day. And I brought them along with me, Skipper. They're looking for work, ex-Navy men, know all about boats. You'll find a job for them, huh? Jobs? Now, wait a minute. I'll be looking for a job myself unless Burton pulls things through. But, Skipper, the accident was all my fault. We've got to do something! Why, they might sue us. Alright. Alright. I'll do what I can. Thank heavens you didn't run over a battleship. Aw, thanks, Skipper. So long, Clarence. See you later. Bye, Shirley. [ Laughter ] It sounded like the launching of a dreadnought. Woman: Yeah, I'd like to see you do any better! Okay, baby. Okay. Don't you do a jackknife now and get hurt. Aw, shut up. I got to eat. Watch out, girls. Here I go! [ Indistinct conversations ] Now, watch, girls. Now, watch the old professor. [ Laughter ] That was terrible! How was that, beautiful? It was awful. Oh, Shirley, I think that was wonderful. [ Shirley speaking indistinctly ] Hey, scram, Sandy, scram! But the big one had gone down for the second time before I got him! -Oh! Submerge! Submerge! Either that or go under. Shirley: Watch your step. So anyway, I had to dive overboard and rescue him, and, of course, he couldn't swim a stroke, so I had to hit him! And anyway, the other one was standing on the boat here, you know, yelling and waving! Here is one of them now. He really couldn't swim a stroke, could he? Uh -- uh, no, sir...Uh, yes. What did you say? I said, "He really couldn't swim a stroke, could he?" No, ma'am. I bet you'll win a Carnegie medal for that, Shirley. Where is he? Why, I... Well, he's -- he's, uh, taking a bath. You certainly can swim like a fish. Sandy: I ought to, beautiful. I was champion of the old battlewagon last year. [ Scatting ] Shh. Stop that. Have you been over here long? No, I just landed. I came over with some goofy old millionaire's daughter. She ran over my rowboat, and I ribbed her into jumping overboard in her BVDs. She thought I couldn't swim. [ Scatting ] ♪ Scrammy, scrammy, scrammy ♪ Sandy: ...this morning? She's uptown now getting her rich papa to give me a swell job. Is that so? And that's the story as told to me by an old sea captain in Switzerland. Get your clothes and get off my boat. Oh, now, listen, please. How am I gonna get back to San Pedro? Swim, Mr. Champion. Swim. It's only 25 miles. And don't forget, that's my bathing suit. Okay. Okay. If that's the way you feel about it, take it. -Oh! -Oh! So prosperity is just around the corner. Somebody must have moved the corner. Oh, how did I know she couldn't take a joke? You're a fine guy to be handling these wealthy dames. You're not so hot. Now, why wouldn't I be in a jam? With you acting as lookout, it's a wonder I ain't in jail. Well, didn't I try to tip you off? Everybody could see you for miles around. Why didn't you cut out the dives? Listen, you... Hi, officer. Nice day today. Yeah, and the paper said fair weather Saturday, probably followed by Sunday. You boys got a job? Why, uh, yes. I...We... No, but you know where we could get one, maybe a little one in a restaurant or something? I thought so. Well, you birds be off this island by 6:00, or I'll fix it so you'll be working for the city. Uh, Mr. Officer? When does the next boat sail? At 10:00 tonight. Well, it looks like we're working for the city. Not unless your gab puts us there. Listen, the next time you shift your big mouth into high gear, be sure your brain is turning over. [ Sighs ] You hurt my feelings. Two, please. Two what? What time does the next boat start? Why, immediately, ladies! Step right aboard. The boats in the race will start just in a few minutes! Prosperity has turned the corner. I told you, pal. But... Right this way! What the... What's the matter with you? Have you gone to pieces? Ixnay ackingcray. What? Get those boats started. If we work fast, we might grab up enough coin to get off this island. But we'll go to jail fooling around with those boats! We're going to jail anyway. What's the difference? Oh, about six years. Oh, get on there. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, ladies and gentlemen! Ride in a real racing boat in a real race! If you're in the boat that wins, you'll get a ride free! Absolutely! Right this way, girls. Thank you. Right down the gangplank. Aw, nuts, popcorn, chewing gum and candy. Sandy: Right this way, ladies and gentlemen! Which boat do we take? Take the one in the water, lady. [ Both laughing ] Isn't he funny? Sandy: If you're in the boat that wins... 50 cents, 4 bits, a half a dollar, Pop. -I'm paying for the party. -Right. I'm so glad to get a boat ride. Well, I am glad, too. Right this way! Hey, hey, hey! If you're in the boat that wins, you get a ride free for the thrill of your life! Which boat do you think will win? Maybe both of them. Oh, wouldn't that be lovely? Right. Here you are. There you are. Dollar and a half today. Are these really the fastest boats in the world? Absolutely, lady! They go so fast, they blow your sins away! [ Giggling ] How'd you know? Ain't this the cutest thing? Is this an unsinkable boat? Yeah, unless we get into soft water. Has it got a round bottom? What? Has it got a round bottom? Sandy: The thrill of a lifetime, that's what it is, the thrill of a lifetime. Right this way, the thrill of a lifetime for 50 cents, 4 bits or half of a dollar. Hurry, hurry, hurry! Well, a new idea, isn't it? Oh, it's the laziest thing on Earth. It's the fastest thing on the water. Pick your boat, Pops. The race is starting. You'll get the speed thrill of a lifetime. Maybe I oughtn't to tackle anything with such terrific speed. Oh, you won't mind. It'll be a great experience for you, right down the gangplank, Pops, right down the gangplank. [ Bumpy whistling ] Sorry, folks. The boats are filled. You'll have to wait until the next race. You just sit in there. We'll do the best we can. Cast off, Bumpy. Cast off. Hey. We ain't going fast, are we? What? You'll get me crazy. I want them wide-open. Make it look real. Cast off. Alright. Needn't be nervous, Pop. After you get back, you'll have something to tell the grandchildren about! Step right aboard, sir. Remember, folks, you're going to have the thrill of a lifetime, and the people in the boat that wins get to ride free! [ All cheering ] Bumpy! Let's go! [ All cheering, screaming excitedly ] [ Indistinct conversations ] Don't get nervous, Pop. Pretty good boat, hey? That's because you ain't used to speed. I could build a boat to go three times this fast! Yeah? How? Oh, a landlubber wouldn't understand it. [ Indistinct conversations ] Careful. Let's go around the steamer. Anything you say, dear. Wait for me in the club, will you? Well, now, that was pretty good speed. [ Laughing ] Why, Pop, I'm afraid you and speed are not very well acquainted. Why, I have got an idea undercover that would make this old tub look like a garbage scow. Now, you take this fellow, Jameson. He thinks he can build racing boats. Why, I'll show him a boat that will make him think he's building washing machines. Yeah? What kind of a boat? Oh, better than 100 miles an hour, new type of engine. All the big companies plan to grab it. Oh, is that so? Must be a pretty big proposition. Big? It's stupendous! It's mammoth! It's colossal, and it's getting bigger! [ Indistinct conversations ] Who's that? Oh, nobody. You know her? Yeah, some old millionaire's spoiled kid, ran down our rowboat and then got peeved because I convinced her to jumping overboard to rescue us. No sense of humor. Oh, you think so, hey? Yeah, and, say, did she burn up when she found out I could swim! [ Laughing ] I imagine she did. [ Indistinct conversations ] [ All cheering ] Right this way, folks. Remember you get a free ride! Better stay for your free ride, Pop. Sorry, young man. I'll take that free ride some other time. Yeah? Come and see me. I want to have a long talk with you. Okay. Jameson! Well, I'll be. [ Indistinct conversations ] [ Laughter ] What's the matter with her? I didn't say anything! [ Indistinct conversations ] [ Laughing ] Oh, you big dud. -So long, Shirley. -Hello. Nice morning for a swim. It was. Brr! Temperature low with lots of air. You don't expect to win a race with that stroke. Everybody can't be perfect, Mr. Champion. Okay. Okay. If that's the way you feel about it. Just what is wrong with my stroke? Everything. You're breathing wrong! Your head is too high, way out of the water, and your timing is terrible. Anything else? Yep. Your sense of humor is bunk. Is that so? Can't anything be done about it? Oh, I don't know anything about your sense of humor, but I can help your swimming. I trained a lot aboard ship. The admiral was my last pupil. Really? Did he learn easily? Oh, he was swimming before he knew it, and I can help you, but you'll have to follow strict training rules, no late hours, bed every night at 10:00... Yes, professor. ...and a long workout every day. Aye, aye, captain. [ Boat approaching ] Hello, Clarence. Morning, dear. A relative? Why, uh, mnh-mnh. Oh, I get it. Well, I hope I'm not intruding. Oh, no. We're quite fond of older people. Uh, Clarence, this is Sanderson Norton, but just call him Sandy. Sandy, Mr. Burton. Glad to know you, Mr. Burton. Gonna be on the island long? Yes, I live here. Oh, fine! Why, you didn't tell me about Mr. Burton. You see, I'm living here, too. Isn't that just dandy? Sandy is going to train me for the Regatta Swim. He teaches admirals to swim. Huh. How very interesting. Yes, yes, yes, but I like this work better. Well, Shirley, I'm having some friends aboard the yacht for lunch. You'll come, won't you? Now, isn't that too bad? What's too bad? Miss Jameson is going into training this morning. That's right, Clarence, can't break training rules. Well-spoken, Miss Jameson. Oh, me, lackaday, the sacrifices one makes in the interest of sport. Now, if you will pardon me, Mr. Burton, while I report to the skipper. On my return, you may bid us bon voyage. Excusez-moi, s'il vous plait. Adios, señorita. So they think I've retired, eh? Ha ha! I think they'll find out that I'm just waking up. Why, son, with this idea of yours and with what I know about building speedboats, we'll show them we've only been playing with them! Oh, we'll show them better than 100 miles an hour. My boy, your only fault is modesty. 120 at least! Maybe I was holding out a bit, Skipper. I bet we hit 125! 130, or I'll furl my sail! Oh, let's make it 150 and call it a day! [ Both laughing ] [ Laughing continues ] Oh, hello, Clarence. Sandy and I were just discussing... Hurricane velocity in the South Seas. You know, that's quite a bit of wind down there, Skipper, and... Yes, I rather suspect that all the wind isn't confined to the South Seas. Mr. Jameson, I think it's time you and I had a private talk if it can be arranged. Oh, of course, now, certainly. Sandy, suppose you see me in my office. Okay. Okay, Skipper. I know I promised I'd quit, but this gas turbine is a million-dollar commercial proposition! Gas turbines? Preposterous. Not this design. It's the greatest thing since the invention of the steam engine. It'll bring orders pouring in. And bankrupt you when it fails. You'll be ruined, your business gone. Dad, please take Clarence's advice. Now, you wouldn't like to see your old dad sitting around in a rocking chair and letting America lose that cup without a fight, would you? Of course you wouldn't, and mark my words, honey. The old man is going to lick them again. Mr. Jameson, you can't build this crazy engine. You haven't the money. But I have friends. There's a dozen of them over at the yacht club that would jump at the chance to come in. Boys, I've been building winning boats for a good many years, and I never asked anything from you but cheers. You think I'm broke. You think I can't come back. Well, I don't have to come back, boys, because I've never been away, but I'm going to have that engine built and a boat launched in less than 60 days! Can't you see, Sandy? Dad can't afford to make a mistake. He's too old to start all over again. You won't let him, will you? He'll listen to you. He thinks an awful lot of you. Aw, I like him, too. He's grand. He's the best I've ever known. Then you will talk him out of that engine? I'll try. Oh, I knew you would if you understood. You're a good egg, Sandy. Ah, don't be silly. I'd do anything for you. You saved my life. Oh! I'll drown you for that crack! Oh! Help, baby! There's lifesavers, baby! Oh, I'll fix you for that! [ Screaming playfully ] Where are you? Stop that! Stop! Where are you, huh? Sandy! Sandy, where are you? I told you your stroke was funk. I thought you were going to teach me? Come on, I can do a mile before lunch. Alright. Follow the old master. Can you get in? I'll try! Get in. Huh? You okay? Oh, I'm stuck. Huh? Now we're gonna... Now you're gonna swim from St. Catherine's right down there Baloney Point. Straighten your arm stroke out a little. Reach up more. Don't let your elbows touch the water until your hands are in. Hey, Sandy. Take me aboard. I'm getting tired. Nope, another quarter of a mile. Don't you think I can't do it? I know you can. Come on, now. [ Both laughing ] Whoo! Now, by the time you row us home, you'll have a good workout. Well, of all the nerve! I won't row any man around anybody's ocean. Okay, then we'll both row. Slide over. Alright, now. Stroke, stroke. You tired? Uh-huh. Well, I'll give you a lift. [ Sighs ] Oh! Aren't you a bit familiar? Unh-unh. It's a freedom of the seas. Say, there's a grand dance going on at the village tonight. Oh. Well, I'm having dinner tonight with... with Mr. Burton. But dancing is great practice for swimming. It develops your wind. Well, then I'll dance a great deal tonight... with Mr. Burton. Oh, Sandy! [ Both laughing ] How dare you! How dare you! Help! Help, help, help, help, help. Young lady, I like your nerves. And I like yours. Vanilla! Raspberry! [ Laughs ] Stroke. Well, I've told you often enough. So what do you think, Shirley? Oh, Clarence, don't be so persistent. You never give me time to decide if I love you. Oh. Alright. How much time do you need? Hello, Shirley. Hello, Sandy. Hello. It's past 10:00. Teacher's spank. Oh, to the devil with that training nonsense. Oh, no, no, Clarence. Sandy is quite right. I'll run right along. Well spoken. Marvelous pupil. I wish I had a dozen like her, but beginning tomorrow, I don't think I'll allow you out nights at all. I told her to dance with you tonight just for exercise. Thank you. Shirley, would it be breaking training rules for me to walk home with you? Not if she goes straight home. Well, thank you. You're very lenient. It's my one great failing. [ Laughter ] You think you can trust us? No, I guess I'd better tag along. Just forget I'm here, though. Now, take a deep breath every third step like this. One, two, three, breathe. One, two, three, breathe. One, two, three, breathe. One, two, three, breathe. One, two, three, breathe. One, two, three, breathe. You're out of step, breathe. One, two, three, breathe. One, two, three, breathe. One, two, three, breathe. One, two, three, breathe. One, two, three, breathe. One, two, three, breathe. Oh, that was great. Nothing like it. Did you a lot of good, too. Yes, good night. Why, I'm gonna wait and walk home with you. Run along, Clarence. Good night. Well... Good night. Good night. Sleep tight. Ahh, nothing like the sleep you get before 12:00, and from now on, I'm gonna see that she's tucked in before that time. Norton? Yeah? Has Miss Jameson told you that we are engaged? Why, no. Has she told you? Well, practically. Practically. Now, when I was in the Navy, I was practically an admiral, but the Navy department didn't know a thing about it. Going my way? No. Good night. Pleasant dreams. One, two, three, breathe. One, two, three, breathe. One, two, three -- [ Laughing ] One, two, three, breathe. One, two, three. [ Humming ] [ Whistling ] Oh. Thanks a lot. That's the first word you've spoken to me in two months. [ Ship horn blowing ] Where's my father? That makes four words. I believe the reason is clearly understood. Oh, say, listen, Shirley. You know I couldn't talk the Skipper out of going ahead with my engine. You know how enthusiastic he gets. I can't help it if he sees what a wonderful proposition this... Well, well, young lady. This is a treat. Why, you haven't been in this office in a month of Sundays. Hello, Sandy. Hello, Skipper. Why, I'm sorry, Skipper, but I haven't been in the mood. You understand. Of course, of course. You didn't feel like cheering, so you kept out of sight of the old man's follies. Oh, I know what everybody says about me, but I'll fool them. I'll show them real speed. Oh, I hope you do, and I'm with you 1,000%. I know you are, and, honey, are you gonna change your mind and christen the fastest boat that ever slid down the waves? Still want me to? Want you to? Sandy: Take her away. Pull her off the turntable. Come here. Come here. I'll crack you over the hull with this. Now, wait a minute. Don't get so familiar. Who you think is getting launched around here, you or this boat? You're a swell sailor, you are. You know what it means to break the champagne bottle on this boat? It means I ain't gonna get any now. It's all set, Skipper. May I have the pleasure? Excuse me. Well, uh, I... Oh, it's a great morning for speed. There you are. Sandy, are you sure, absolutely sure it's going to succeed? Oh, it's in the bag. Won't you try to believe me? I want to, more than I've ever wanted to believe anything. It's...Oh, it means so much to Dad. It's gonna mean a lot to you and to me, but I'll tell you about that later. Now, you sock her right on the nose. Well, Dad, here it goes. Go ahead. Uh... Aren't you forgetting something? Good luck, Skipper. Sail on to victory. I christen you Miss Victory, Queen of Speed. [ Glass shatters ] Bravo. Isn't she a beauty in the water? I can hardly wait to get my hands on that wheel. Skipper. She's a honey. You can just feel the lightning in her. Give her the gun, Skipper. Give her the gun. Put that down. You remember what happened to the Admiral's barge? So anybody can make a slight error. Yeah, that's what's worrying me now. How do you know we're not gonna make another slight error? Because we've got this engine lit, stupid. Listen to her run. Just listen. [ Explosion ] [ Engine sputtering ] [ Bell ringing, bugle playing ] [ Siren wailing ] Skipper! [ Wailing continues ] Hurry up, Clarence. Hurry, they're burning up. Starboard! Father! Oh, but, darling, are you hurt? You knew that boat wasn't safe, but you let him take a chance. You knew it! Oh, I hate you. Please. Please, won't you let me see the Skipper just for a minute? It's very important to him. No. How many times must I tell you? But I've got to see him. Don't you understand? I'm -- I'm sorry, honestly I am. I wouldn't do anything to hurt him or you. Well, you should have thought of all that before it was too late. Too late? You -- you mean he's -- he's worse? Yes, I'm afraid so, but the trouble now is more grief than anything else. You broke his heart. I -- I'm sorry, but hasn't he asked for me? Doesn't he want to see me? I haven't mentioned you to him, and I don't intend to after the way you lied to him and cheated him. But I didn't lie to him, don't you understand? If you'd only let me talk to him, I know I can make that boat a success. I know I can. It isn't too late. There's a fortune in it right now for him. Yes, I've heard all that before. Well, you'll have to talk to Mr. Burton now. He's taken over what little you've left of Daddy's business and is trying to save something. Yeah, you know it's no use of my talking to that mug. I'm sure Mr. Burton will be fair, even with you. He's always very kind and considerate. Yeah? So that's the way you feel about him now? I've always thought a great deal of Mr. Burton. Of course, you don't like him because you can't trick him the way you did Daddy. Yeah? Get this. Burton isn't fooling me any either, and I still say he's a mug. Oh, you're impossible. I won't listen to you anymore. Please go. Won't let me see the Skipper, huh? Okay, okay. I'll show them. Uh, break my back trying. He looks pretty bad, huh? Sandy! Bumpy! Why, this is a surprise. Gee, Skipper, we've been trying for a week to get in to see you. We're awfully sorry about all this. Oh, that's all right, boys. Accidents are accidents, you know? But it wasn't an accident, Skipper. I -- I've got to tell you because you've been so white and grand to us. We -- we had the same thing happen to the engine before in the Navy, but I thought it would work out all right this time. Honestly I did. I thought we'd fixed it. Yeah, and so did I. Of course, you did, boys, but I knew you wouldn't deceive me. But everybody says I did. They said I promoted you, and I cheated you and... Never mind, boy, what others say. I know you were on the level with me, and nothing will ever make me think differently. Oh, you're grand, Skipper, to feel like that, and we're going to stick, and we're gonna show you that we can make good for you. We've got to. Yeah, you bet we have. And listen, Skipper, we found out now what's wrong with that engine. You have? What is it? Why, the supercharger on the carburetor. It wasn't strong enough, that's all. I wonder. You think that's why it backfired? I'm sure of it, and listen, Skipper, there's plenty of time to fix it before the race. Yeah, and it -- it won't ever blow up again either because Sandy said so. No use, boys. I haven't the money. No use. When I pay my creditors, I won't have a dollar. Oh. I didn't know it was that bad, Skipper. Aw, ain't that a shame. There's just one chance. Sandy, you go and see Burton. I think he'll help us. I'm sure he will if he understands. He's a businessman. You can sell him this idea. I know you can. Okay. Okay, Skipper. I'll talk to Burton if you want me to. I'll make him come through. That's the talk, boy. A quitter never wins, and a winner never quits. You're dead right, Skipper. A winner never quits, and we're not quitting, you understand? Nothing is gonna make us quit, nothing, nothing! You're a scrapper, boy, a scrapper after my own heart. Well, we're fighting for you, Skipper, just for you, and this is for you, Skipper, for thinking we're on the level. Oh, now, boys. This wasn't necessary. Now you're wasting your time, Norton. Mr. Jameson hasn't any more money to sink in that silly engine even if he was foolish enough to want to. But you've got the money, give me a chance to pull him out. $2,000 or $3,000 is all I... $2,000 or $3,000? You might as well ask for a million. But I don't want anything for myself, not a cent. I've given Mr. Jameson my interest in the engine. Your interest, why, it isn't worth a nickel. But it will be. It will be worth a fortune to him when that engine is rebuilt. I have told you exactly what's wrong with it. Please, give me a chance to help Jameson. I'll do anything. I'll leave the island the minute the work is done. Eh, you'll leave it anyway. I'll see to that. Okay. Okay, I'll leave. But if it isn't the way you expect, don't be surprised. Any luck? Come on, let's get out of here. What's he doing? Ah, those gobs are too dumb to suspect anything. Well, watch your step just the same. We'd better go below. Oh, boy. We'll get 20 years for this. If we do, I hope they put us both in the same cell. I'd like to see what solitary confinement is like. Ahh. Look, the engine has all been cleaned up. Yeah. That's funny. Hey, it's all been reconditioned. Yeah.

As a marine engineer or a rumrunner? Guess my reputation is as good as a guy who supplies the cash. Well, nobody cares where you get your money these days. It's how much you've got that counts. What will it cost to rebuild this engine? $2,500 for more powerful superchargers. She runs perfectly up to 60 miles an hour. Then the engine builds up too much compression and backfires. Alright, Al. You grab that boat at the sale tomorrow in your name, remember? I'll give you cash to make a down payment. Now, here's $1,000. Man on radio: Calling police patrol boat number four.

Well, you'll be an even 60 when you get out. Woman #2: Oh, a raid! Oh, I just love raids. What's in that glass? Lemonade. Hey, give me that. Get away. You're going to like it with winter coming on.

Everything is alright. That's enough of that. You know the law, and you're not 10 years old. Yes, but... No, you're not. You just admitted you were 50. You know, this is going to cause me an awful lot of trouble. You see, my wife isn't on this yacht tonight. Well, whose yacht is she on? Huh? I mean, say, why I am wasting all of my time with you? I've got a lot of raiding to do. Come on, get out... Oh, listen, officer, listen. Wait a minute. Now, I'll do anything to avoid a scandal. Can't we talk business? Are you trying to bribe me? Oh, no.

Pirates! Mother! So there we are, gentlemen. That's why I've called you all here today. These unspeakable crooks and pirates must be captured. Yes. We've got to offer a reward large enough to bring them to justice. -Yes. -Great idea. Now, I'm willing to start the subscriptions off for $1,000. Good, bravo. Gosh, I take a swell picture. Yeah. Hey, I should have shaved, shouldn't I? Yeah. You know, those guys wouldn't give the Skipper a thin dime to build this boat, but they'd spot 10 grand to keep us from making it a success. Well, it ain't the reward that's worrying me. It's when somebody is gonna collect it. Oh, we'll do the collecting. I wonder which one of these guys is gonna make the next little loan.

They're not really crooks? Not crooks? I should like to know what else you... Preposterous, sir. Preposterous! The police will know what to call them when they catch them. Yes, but they haven't caught them yet, not by a long ways, believe me, you, and once more, I hope they don't catch them. Now, what do you think of that? Plain crazy. Why, I'm astonished at you, Mr. Jameson. Those men are a danger. They're a menace to society. Oh, baloney. Why, Skipper, how can you talk like when you know all they've done? They deserve to be caught. Nonsense, child. It's all Clarence's fault anyway. If he'd helped them when they asked, none of this would have happened. Well, I like that. So I'm the goat, eh? Oh, Father, how can you say such things about Clarence? I can't understand your father. He's really unreasonable, you know, dear. Sandy! Shirley, I want to talk to you.

That's pretty cheap, but it suits you. Then you should have told Burton I was here. Well, it's not too late. You don't mean that. Don't I? Just watch me. [ Knock on door ] Aren't you -- Sandy! You're crazy to come here! The police are watching this boat! Don't worry, Skipper. They won't get me. I'm for you, son, but they're not. It's much better to quit now. You said a winner never quits, and I'm not stopping. -No. -I'll stop you! -Help! -Shirley! Shirley! You can't get away now! Surrender to the police, and I'll do everything I can to get you out! I've started this and I'm going to finish it! [ Siren wailing ] [ Indistinct yelling ] [ Women screaming ] [ Indistinct yelling continues ] There he goes up the ladder.
