Ripped by gdhaliwal23 So you are finally here. Boss, stop loitering around and get some work done as well. Be in Manner. I am your boss. All three vehicles will reach there by three. Don't forget to call them and take the payment. The fifth vehicle will be there by five. Be careful. Give me the keys! What? Where are you going now? -Give me the keys now! -Here. Come on already! Hello, sweetheart! You won't stop this, will you? You and your cheesy flirting. You call my love cheesy flirting? This is so wrong. -You will never get a heart attack. -Why? People with hearts made of stone can never get heart attacks. Stop your nonsense. You know that a good pasting always helps to get rid of roadside Romeos. Oh no. Now you are scaring me. But I won't feel bad. Because every beauty has the right to show some attitude. My mother used to say this. I think you have never dealt with lawyers. -I think I will have to tell you. -Then tell me. I am not running away. I want you to fight my case and I'd invest my life in it. Get this straight... Never call me up again. Miss Lali, I'd like to take you out for dinner. You can bring your brother along. Okay? You can enjoy dinner while I enjoy getting beaten up by your brother. I have never met anyone so shameless. I won't go for any dinner. Miss Lali, I am going to India tomorrow. Please, have a candlelight dinner with me before I leave. Please? I told you, I am not interested. It's final. Really? Then there you go. All the formulas to keep romance alive in married life are great. Well, most of them don't work, that's another issue. They value work but they don't value people. What happened? Angry is more valuable or pounds? You know, when I hung up on you, I realized that I don't need to waste a few hundred pounds on food. Only fortunate ones get food cooked by their spouse. Harry! No saliva! Only fortunate ones get saliva from their spouse. Come on. -Really? -You don't believe me? Here, hold my bag. He has a way with words. Unlock the door. What's for dinner? Yogurt, kidney beans... And I will be cooking rice. You will eat and go to bed. Lali! Today, I will do the dishes. That's me. Fateh. I am sneaking in like a thief instead of showing up like a hero. Not by choice, but out of fear of my brother Harry and sister-in-law. -Let me go, bro. -Keep it down. You'll get us into trouble. Please let me go. Listen to me. Where are you coming from so late in the night? It's not that late. It's just ten o'clock. I don't know why you can go to bed so early like scared goats. What will I tell the lioness sleeping inside? Where have you been? Bro, hockey... I had gone to watch a hockey match. Harry! Yes? I came to pee. I thought you were talking to someone. Who is in there with you? Sister-in-law... I just got a little emotional. You work so hard. -You do so much for us. -Liar. I don't know whether I am doing enough for you or not. Harry... You don't have to be so emotional. -Come to bed. -Okay, love. Go, I am coming. Come already! But you just hit me. Really? I forgot. Listen up! Don't you dare mention this game again. -Why do you... -Do you see this? So... You are late again? Lali, I... I am not talking to you. -No, I... -What? I what? He sent me out. For what work did he send you out at midnight? What secret mission was it that later you two were whispering in the washroom? Yes? I am talking to you, Fateh. How many times have I told you... both of you... That I get very angry if you lie or hide anything... from me. -Well... -What? Go. You have to go to college tomorrow. -Don't forget this. -Okay. No lying or hiding anything in this family. Okay. Let's go. We have to go to work tomorrow. Go. -Give me the bag, bro. -Why, take it yourself. Sometimes I feel like I am in a prison. I cannot meet girls. I cannot play hockey. I have to carry my own bag. I have to wash my own clothes. You should let me do as I please sometimes. Aren't you getting late? Okay, come on, boys. Focus, yeah? -Come on, boys. -Yes. Go boys! Yes! Nice one! Nice one! I always enter the university like a hero. Whether or not anyone notices me, I don't care. So Harry, how many goals did you score? We are leading by 2-1. It will end as 7-2. You guys will only be able to score two. They will be scoring seven. Go away, man. You're not playing anyways. Don't sit outside the field and keep making predictions. Naaz! Hurry up! He is here. Come on, hurry up! He is almost here. Naaz! He is here. Hurry up. -No... -Fateh! This Indian chick who is even more beautiful than Englishwomen... She is crazy about me. But I have to stay away from her as well. Fateh... Let me express my feelings to you today. You should keep your feelings in your heart. You are under the oath of KFC's old man. I am already in a lot of trouble. I won't be able to give you my heart. Goodbye. -Goodbye. -So... Goodbye. So? What? 7-2. Now do you believe me? -What is this? -You tell me. That's the goal post. That's the goalkeeper. -And this... -And... you will say that those two cans are defense? Wonderful. If only you had used your brains on the field as well then it would've been 2-1. Forget it. Here, the deep sweeper passes the ball to the right defender. Right defender passes the ball to right midfielder. Right midfielder will pass the ball to right attacker. The defense of right wing is stronger so it will be difficult to score there. Hence, the ball passes. Middle midfielder to the left attacker. Close the left defender, body dribble. And score a goal from the right side of the goalie. Come on, man. This is not how hockey is played. The goalkeeper will throw your ball across. The ball isn't being passed so scoring a goal is impossible. How is it impossible? I just showed it to you. -Forget it. -You don't play hockey on a table. You play it on the ground. These glasses won't hold you back. You can score as many goals as you want. What do you want? When the time comes, I shall score a goal on the ground as well. Trials for the university club will be taking place. I'll see what you can do there. Look, I've already told you that the situation in my house is quite tense. My sister-in-law has asked me to stay away from girls from England. And my brother has asked me not to stay away from hockey. Excuses. You can make as many as you want. Fine. I am getting late for my class. Naaz, why were you so rude to him? I don't know what happens to me in front of him. I don't understand that either. Do you like him or hate him? Like every year, white coach Clayton and Punjabi coach Grewal... are arguing over the same thing. This time as well Clayton had kept only white players in the university's team. White skin, cat eyes and a black heart. That's Clayton. A creature of habit. According to him, no one can play hockey better than Englishmen. And he has sworn not to lose a single opportunity to make fun of Punjabis and Indians. Yes, dear? Okay, dear. Clayton is right. Most Indians here are into manual labor. How will they play hockey? There has to be someone... who can shut them up. There's a boy in my class. He's a very good player. He can beat all Britishers. Who? Send him to me. He isn't allowed to play hockey. So much anger? We want to win the world... But our own don't let us play. Unfulfilled dreams hurt the most. You have one last chance to fulfill your dream. Give it here. Your bag's quite heavy today. Is it heavy? I don't have bricks in it. If only you ever went to university would you know how burdensome education can be. We have to work hard, bro. This isn't a gearless taxi that anybody can drive. It is loaded with books. Bye. See you in the evening. Okay. Double damn. I gathered all the courage I could and came here for trials. And here they are arguing over the same old thing. Grewal insists that our boys have a better technique than the white players. But most players voted for the white players. And as usual, Mr. Grewal couldn't do anything. -Hello, Fateh. -Hello... Remain seated, son. My daughter Naaz told me about you. She says you are very good hockey player. Well, sir, I sometimes... Coach has got another one of his losers. There you go. They called me a loser. Let's go then. Sir, I am not in the mood for it. Okay, then sit and watch the game. We'll talk about this later. Okay? -Yeah. -Damn... Son, you alright? Coach! I am in the mood for it now. I too know that. I was just having a little fun. Come on, now I'll give you taste of my hockey. Fateh! Hey, come on! Come on, focus, boys. Good. Bill... Yeah! I knew my heart was no longer mine From the time I looked into her blue eyes I knew my heart Was no longer mine From the time I looked into her blue eyes My restless eyes Seek her sight I eagerly wait for her This is how bad is my plight I knew my heart Was no longer mine From the time I looked into her blue eyes I knew my heart was no longer mine From the time She has entered my life My dreams Have become fragrant and bright My dreams When I try to touch her She disappears In my dreams Then I search for her in despair I knew my heart Was no longer mine From the time I looked into her blue eyes I knew my heart What are you hiding? Nothing... Nothing. Don't hit me. What are you hiding? No, it hurts! Nothing. -Liar! What are you hiding? -Please... It's nothing. -What? -Stop it, man. Wait. This. When did we come here? When I was this small. I wasn't this small. I was quite big when I came here. I have a lot of responsibilities on me. Do you think I am your enemy? I don't steal anything from anyone. I don't do drugs. You are always hitting me. People get milk and cream while growing up and all I got were whacks from you. Where were you born? No, Punjab! -Tell. -Sansarpur, Jalandhar district, Punjab. Sansarpur. Sansarpur. Sansarpur. Do you know anything about Sansarpur? This game that you play... It was born there. Sit. I have heard my elders saying that... A mother was preparing a meal... What's wrong, son? Why are you shaking your legs? You shouldn't do that. -I want to play. -You want to play? He wants to play. Wait. Wait here, I'll be right back. Wait here. She gathered a few rags and tied them together. She made a ball out of it. Here you go. Look at this. What is this? They had a berry tree in their house. She broke a branch from it, cleaned it and give it to her son. This is a ball and this is a stick. Look at this... Go, go, go... Go and get it. It kept the child occupied. And the mother got back to her work. Every child in the village started playing with it. Get your sticks. -Coming. -Hurry up. They used to push the ball around with their sticks. Wait. Play with my ball. Give it to me. Give it to me. Give it to me. This addiction of the children soon became the favorite game for all the villagers. -It was called ball... -...stick. Back then, there used to be a British camp close to Sansarpur. An army camp. That camp is still there. It's now called Jalandhar Cantonment. Villagers from our village used to go there to work. They used to take their kids with them. And kids used to play with the ball and stick whenever they had free time. On the other side, Englishmen used to play polo. Englishwomen stopped watching polo... and instead started watching the kids play with the ball and sticks. Ball and stick. Ball and stick. Ball and stick. Britishers being Britishers, they wanted to know what it is. So they tried to find out. As usual... Then later named the game hockey. -Hey, what's that stick called? -Khundi. Sansarpur, a tiny tract on planet earth. But a sport honed and played here... got glorified in the world as hockey. Sansarpur, Punjab, India. These three names became renowned in the world of sports. 1926: Australia and New Zealand. 1928: Europe. 1932: America, Holland, Czechoslovakia, Japan and Germany. Indian hockey created such a benchmark... That no one has still been able to match up to it. From 1928 to 1960, we had 30 international wins, Fateh. From 1928 to 1960, 178 goals. And how many goals against them? Only seven. The biggest win in the Olympics was against America. 24-1. And why did they get to score that one goal? Because the goalie was standing behind and giving an autograph. The Indian hockey team is a team... which has won gold five times in Olympics. Our Sansarpur is a village which has not given one, two, five or ten, but fifteen Olympians to India. 1978 Olympics. Nine people marching behind Indian flag. Four people marching behind Kenya flag. Two people behind Canada flag. In one Olympic, there were 15 people from the same village in three teams of different countries. Can you beat it? Do you know anything about Sant Singh? He was an Olympian? He was our father. -Go Shinde. -Pass the ball. -Go, go, pass it. -Hurry up. -Go for it! -Goal! Very good! Amazing! Wonderful! -Hello. -Hello. Sant Singh, you are always so busy. Can't you spare time to talk to us? Brother Balbir, brother Pargat... You have set examples by winning Olympic medals. And the boys who want to follow your footsteps... I just look after the grounds for them. And what if we ask you for something? Whatever you want, sir. Tell me, what can I do for you? Sant Singh... Though there is a hockey player in every household of this village... We are here because we know your son is very talented. Your son plays a good game. Okay. We have come here so that we can take him to play for the Indian hockey team. Sant Singh, your son can also score a goal with a broken hockey stick. If we train him in Patiala, then in the future, he might not just play nationally but in the Olympics as well. This can help our country and this village once again find its place back on hockey's map. Brother Pargat, thank you... for thinking about my son. But... You know how bad my financial situation is. I will have to spend money to send him to Patiala. And I cannot afford that. So, if you can help me, then... Sant Singh, you know the condition our association is in. Even after three years of hard work, we have managed to lay only half the turf. I don't know what the truth is... But we have got only this much money... from the money that was allotted to us by the government. You should think it over. We too will try our best. Goodbye. Goodbye. Father? You don't want me to play hockey anymore? You have played enough hockey in this village. Now it's time you venture out of this village. You... You take this with you. A new hockey stick. I got you admitted into Patiala sports academy. You should now practice very hard. I don't think you will now have time to hug anyone. -You want to eat samosas? -No. Have some. How are you doing? Look there, a new player. A new player is better ignored. Go, go, go. Pass it to me. Do it. Pass it to me. Goal! Very good. -That's a nice goal. -Very good. -Hey! -Captain is calling us. -Let's go. -Let's see what he has to say. What will he say? We did good. You are not bad. -What do you say, boys? -Yes, captain. You should work hard. Captain doesn't praise anyone so easily, brother. Only an expert knows the true value of a gem. -Let's go. -We will see what happens. Let's go. Let's go to the canteen. You want one? Don't. I concentrate on practice and not on the uniform. I know. I am doing well in my practice. Coach too is pleased with me. Captain is a little jealous. But he still praises me. I know. They are coming to select players for the national team tomorrow. They all say that I will get selected. I know that as well. If I get selected in the national team, then I will surely win a medal. If I win a medal, will you marry me? Hurry up, pass the ball. Here, here, here... -Pass the ball... -Over here. Goal! Go for it! Stop, stop, stop. Come here, boy. Have some sweets. Your life is made now. We had great expectations from you, Harry. -And this is how you repaid us. -What do you mean, sir? Don't act naive, as if you don't know anything. Sir, I don't understand what you are talking about. We aren't saying anything, but your drug report surely is. We take samples from all players after the trial of national selection. Your report is positive. You had steroids in your system while playing the game. -Sir, I and drugs-- -You took drugs. Don't act innocent now. Both you and we know that. Understood? Mix it. Sir... sir, I didn't take drugs. You get success by working hard. Drugs can only lead to defamation. You have ruined your father's honor as well as ours. Until today, people used to address Sansarpur as the Mecca of hockey. I don't think they will, henceforth. Sir, I didn't do it. I didn't do it, sir. Sir, I... I don't do drugs. Sir... Sir... I don't do drugs, sir. There's no use begging us. You will learn your lesson when a ten year ban is imposed on you. I don't do drugs, father! -Our land was already mortgaged. -Listen to me. For you I even mortgaged our ancestral home. -Believe me... -You have killed me. I cannot face anyone anymore. Leave me alone. Brother, I can't sleep. The moon Can never leave the sky A relationship bounded by blood Can never break The moon Can never leave the sky A relationship bounded by blood Can never break A babul tree can never provide shade Like the evergreen tree Strangers Can never replace family Strangers can never... I swore by my wife the other day... that I will never play hockey again And I always thought that our father died in an accident. Should I stop playing hockey? You cannot stop playing hockey. Because we have it in our blood. But you can do a few things. First, learn to pass. And your reverse is pathetic, stupid. Move to ring! -Well done, my boy. -Walk away. Here you go. Why are you lying on the ground? I just needed my brothers blessings. I started attacking their goalposts. I kept scoring and people at the university started praising me. Then even started mentioning me in the newspapers. This made them quite jealous of me. Harry! Fateh! Fateh! No! This is how you act responsible? This is how you act responsible? A mistake done once can be considered a mistake. A mistake can be forgiven. To make the same mistake again is a well thought decision. And this is the result of your decision. This! Hockey means death for our family! Have you forgotten that? It's good, you should forget your past. It is a good thing. But not so much of it that you also forget your principles, decisions and your self-respect! What are you trying to do here? Look at me... Look at me! What are you trying to do here? You couldn't fulfill your dreams... So you want to kill that boy? Tell me, do you want to kill him? Don't cry in front of me. Who is this girl? Tell her to leave! Ask her to leave! They have turned their lives into a joke. Hockey! Hockey! Hockey! I am so fed up, Harry! I am so tired of it! Your responsibility, Fateh. Your decision, you will bear it alone now. I am leaving. If it's difficult for you to do it alone then call sister-in-law to help. Sorry. Go get it. Try. Give it to me. Fateh... Go and get it. Once again... Once more... Once again, bro... Bro... Once more... The moon can never leave the sky A relationship bounded by blood Can never break The moon can never leave the sky A relationship bounded by blood Can never break A babul tree Can never provide shade Like the evergreen tree Strangers can never replace family Strangers can never... The moon Can never leave the sky A relationship bounded by blood Can never break The moon Can never leave the sky A relationship bounded by blood Can never break A babul tree Can never provide shade Like the evergreen tree Strangers Can never replace family Strangers Can never replace family There are some relations That break Why worry about the weak relations That break Why worry about the weak relations That break You cannot uproot a relationship Formed with true love Strangers Can never replace family Strangers Can never replace family Brother! Who is he, bro? Relax. Brother... Watch out, bro! Hey! Hey! Bro! Bro! Brother! The moon can never leave the sky A relationship bounded by blood Can never break The moon Can never leave the sky A relationship bounded by blood Can never break A babul tree Can never provide shade Like the evergreen tree Strangers can never replace family I want to fight. Enough! No more fighting. I know all this is happening because of me. Drop it, sister-in-law. -As if you are MIG-21. -I'll whack you! I am talking about fighting in the court. You are going to divorce me? I am talking about fighting against these Englishmen. Let's go. Sister-in-law was no longer angry with us. She decided to take the Englishmen to court. We had no idea that we would get insulted by the Englishmen in the court. The white advocate began the argument by talking about our brown skin. He said that the brown skin matches the brown bread he has for breakfast. The coach of England too very clearly lied that there were two referees in the match. And he wasn't on the ground when it happened. Hence, he couldn't see anything. The second referee, that is coach Grewal, the second witness and our only hope. This hope would have been fruitful if on the day of the attack Clayton had not executed his plan well. Then they misled coach Grewal... and turned the case into their favor. They planned, lied and won the case. But it didn't end there. All limits were crossed when coach Clayton questioned our pride over hockey. He said, why don't you give up hockey and start playing chess instead? Listen up... Tell your coach and dean that I'm going to meet them tomorrow at 11. Fateh... Harry didn't come home to eat either. What does he want to do? Harry... Let's go. Return tickets for you and your hockey team. And money, lodging and boarding. I could have told them that in English too. But when your pride is questioned, you can give a fitting reply only in your own language. Translate. Three months from now, your team shall play my team. I sold all the four taxis. I have done my part. Will you be able to yours? Now that our honor is at stake, I'll even play with broken legs. Punjab. Bro, when will we reach Punjab? Why? This is Punjab, why? What, this is Punjab? Where are those mustard fields? Where are those girls carrying cattle grass? Where are those boys with drums in their hand? Where's the dance? What kind of a Punjab is this? Okay, so you want the Punjab they show in Yash Chopra's movies? Yes, that Punjab. Then get this straight. Listen carefully now. Mustard grows only in February and March. And they play drums only during a wedding. Understood? Look ahead now. -Hello. -Hello. God bless you, son. -Can I go inside? -Sure. Go ahead. Brother, why don't they show this Punjab in the movies? Yeah. Hello, brother. Hello. It was very dirty. I cleaned up as much as I could. It's okay. Get our bags from outside. -Hello. -Hello. I really wanted to cook for you on a rural stove. I too wanted to eat that same food under the stars. I wanted to feed you under the stars. Both of you... won't even be able to get out of these cobwebs. Sister-in-law, tell me. Did he spend 150,000 pounds to make you a lawyer so that you end up cooking for him like this? Stop romancing, Romeo and Juliet! We have to focus on hockey. We are here for hockey. Here! What did I say, bro? Look, everyone has some dreams he or she wishes to fulfill. Right, Mr. Muscle? So romancing is also one of them, right? We have to go meet the headman. Let's go. Let's go, come on. Son, if you had challenged them for a game of cards, then we have three teams ready. Son, you picked a big fight without using your brains. To know how deep the water is, you first dip one foot in. You don't just jump right into it. But uncle, you have seen the golden era of Sansarpur's hockey. It is a thing of the past, Harbir. Now the youth only have drugs in their blood. Weren't there drugs available during your time? There were. This is all about emotions. If we encourage the youth, then they too will play well. The truth is that hockey is long dead here. Hockey cannot die. Hockey is in our blood. Being in the blood doesn't matter. It should be visible on the grounds. We'll get it back on the ground. Stop being stubborn, Harbir. The government couldn't revive it, you think you can? Sansarpur isn't the government's village, it's my village. I'll bring hockey back to life. Wait. Listen up, son. Where does the Olympian Pritpal live? Gold Pritpal or bronze Pritpal? And he said that hockey is dead in this village. He has all the names on his fingertips. Gold Pritpal, son. Brother, he stays there, in the last house on the left. -Let's go. -Let me finish. Otherwise, you will have to come back. The gold medalist no longer lives in this village. The bronze medalist lives right opposite to him. You should knock on his door. Understood? Understood? Understood. Let's go. -Bye. -See you. Fateh... Fateh... Hello, sir. -Hello. -Sir, my name is Harry. He is my younger brother, Fateh. Mr. Pritpal, 1976 Olympics. He played a very important role in it. I am a big fan, sir. Sir, we are trying to form a hockey team in Sansarpur. We want our village's name to once again shine before the world. Really? That's a good thought. But you are staying in England these days, right? Yes, sir. You wouldn't have thought of such a thing if you were living here. Would you move aside, please. Bro... Human beings can make mistakes. If you want, I can talk to Coach Clayton and tell them that we are no longer angry and so he too should let go of his anger. Right? Hello. Actually, I want to form a hockey team in Sansarpur. Why? So that the boys can play in the nationals. How will that help? -They will get medals. -And then? Then they will play internationally and also get medals there. And how will that help? That would be great for our village. It cannot get greater than this. Oh no, the ball has hit Indian goalkeeper Kular's eyes. This could cost the Indian hockey team a valuable goalkeeper. Goalkeeper Kular's bright future in hockey could seep into darkness. Stop it, Fateh. Stop doing that. Sit back and relax. Stop it. I apologize for the mistake I never made. And we apologize for the mistake we perhaps made. We didn't believe you. We suspected Sansarpur. Forgive us... Because what our hearts said and what the situation dictated didn't match. Come here... come on. Coach, I have heard a lot about Sansarpur. I also heard that there are less believers in God and more believers of hockey. But we still haven't found 11 people who can play hockey here. You need two things to play any game. Talent and desire. You can learn the talent. But the desire comes from within. From the time we have come here, we haven't met a single player who has a desire to play. To rekindle the fire, you need to move away the ashes. -What do you mean? -I know a few players. If they are given proper training, then they can play well. Okay. That's great. Let's go and meet them then. First person, Kashmir Singh, AKA Shera. Listen up... Don't talk about hockey in front of me. I have played hockey for a long time. It has no money in it. You are NRIs. If someone has usurped your land, then tell me. -No one has usurped our land. -Then why don't you usurp someone's? Forget that. Tell us if you are interested in playing hockey. Do you know who I am? My anger is deadly. Don't waste my time. Leave. Hockey guys... Get up, Chhotu. They left. He is very scared of violence. He will always run away from me. And I think I have taught him enough goalkeeping for you. -Would you like to play, Chhotu? -Yes. Please bring it for me. -Your turban is very nice. -Let me go. I met with my soul mate in my dream. You brought him here so that he can stop taking drugs, right? -What should I do? -He will get rid of the bad habit here. Back off! Scoundrel! -Why don't you get the capsules? -My son... -I beg to you every day. -My boy... -He takes 100 rupees from me every day. -Calm down. -He still doesn't get me any drugs. -Calm down, my child. -How can I calm down, mother? -Calm down. -I beg to him every day. -No. I give him money. -I can't live without drugs. -I am coming. I met Bachchani from our village, the addict's mother. The tong meant for fire... You didn't keep me for yourself... You didn't leave me worthy Of the world either You didn't keep me for yourself... You didn't leave me worthy Of the world either You didn't leave me worthy Of the world either -My body aches -Hello, brother. Get me something Get me some? I beg them every day. Do you have anything? You have done drugs. You have played hockey too. Tell me, what was more fun? We went to Chandigarh hockey academy. We checked their records. Your name is still on the top. They said there was a boy who came and scored four goals in 10 minutes. And yet your name stays anonymous. That happened four years ago. You can never bring the past back. I will bring it back for you. Will you stop taking drugs? The 1984 riots took both my family and hockey away from me. Now I do not have any relationship with anyone apart from this Gurudwara. No one can fill the void left by the family. But if hockey calls out to you, then will you form a relationship with it once again? Would you like to play hockey? I don't have time to play hockey. I have to take care of the cattle too. You can keep people to handle the cattle. Like it's that easy. Help demands money. I will pay for it. Stop, stop, stop. Hey you, don't go offside! Come on, leave. Come on. Stay behind the D. Yes, stay behind the D. Come on, leave. Leave? Do you want a special invite? Leave already! I hope you remember your promise. You will have to pay me every day. I hope you too remember your promise. You will also have to play every day. Go. Listen up, everybody. This has already been decided. I don't want anyone complaining later on. The captain of this team... is me. -Why would we complain? -We are used to this. The one who owns the bat always bats first. And sometimes also runs away after playing his turn. -You will have to play in turns. -You want your turn? Tomorrow morning, 4:30 a.m. What the hell! Water! -Run! -Let's go! -Run! -It's time! Start running quickly! Run! The way we completed our team, with force... With the same brutal force, we began the training of this team. Run! Don't stop! Run, run! Here we were panting by running on the streets and there, the English players were working out in the gym to build their muscles. Run, you scoundrels! -Run! -Let's go. The English players' diet consisted of high protein supplements. And our diet consisted of buffalo's milk. This is the goalpost and that is the target. This shouldn't be seen and the target shouldn't be missed. I won't be happy if the ball passes from the sides. The ball should hit the target. Understood? Get on with it. You will hit the target if you learn how to do it. You know your reverse is weak. Practice. He wants to make us players. He should first learn to play himself, Mr. Great Player. Why did he call us if he didn't want us to play? -His technique is wrong. -We are so tired. -Fateh! -Coach! Get them stretching! Whether I am a good person or a bad person doesn't matter. What matters is that I am a businessman. Okay? I will give your team 11 jerseys and 11 pairs of socks. But the jersey should feature a black calf, its face should be about this big. Won't that make it a buffalo then? No, it is still a calf. One more thing. I will provide the nutrition. I will get you all the groceries. And I will keep a note of everything in my diary. The bottom line, if your team loses, then you will have to pay for everything. If your team wins, then I will strike off everything from the diary. Tell me, do you agree? Agreed. The first match takes place in a week's time. Don't worry, madam. I will make all the arrangements in a week's time. -Let's go. -Okay. -Stop your nonsense! -Who do you think you are? -Go mind your own business! -No! -Listen... -No! Don't! -Damn you! -Stop fighting! -Wait, I'll teach you a lesson! -Stop it! Listen to me! -Move aside! -Stop it! Don't! -Get lost! -Don't fight. Stay away from me! -Don't fight! -No! -Listen to me! -Let me go! -You back off first! -You wait, I'll teach you a lesson. -Come here! -Back off! -He doesn't listen! -Stop fighting! What does he think of himself? Come and see it for yourself then! -Let go of my hockey stick. -Back off, man! -Give it back. -Come here. -Back off. -Let me go! -You come here! Come with me! -Don't do this. -To hell with the team! Useless creeps. -It's your team. -I know how to look after myself. -Leave him alone. -Go away! -See what's happening. -Move aside! -You think you are a great player? -Let him go! Stop it! -Who do you think you are! -Come, teach me. -Back off. -Who is he to say anything? -Back off, man. -You bloody... -Back off. -No, don't hit him. -Come here! -Come on! -He won't learn a lesson otherwise. -I said come here! -I will break your head! -Go and teach him. -Come here. -What are you doing, guys? Come here. -I know what I am doing. Come on, come with me. Come on, let him go. -Let each other go now. -Get lost! -Come on. -Let him go, man. Don't do this. -Tell him! -Stop it. Well, I'll tell you what... Well, the stadium is... not filled with spectators. But I welcome the one or two people who have come here. Brother, we should have invited Harman Cheema, the singer, instead. We would have easily had an audience of 100 at least. Shut up. He wants to invite Harman Cheema. There, both the teams are on the ground. Let me introduce you to Sansarpur's team. -Okay. -The first player is its captain, Fateh Singh. Kang, Bains... Singh, Grewal... Sidhu, Pulsiya, Baba, Kullar... Baamanh, Panchi, Zavar, Vespa, Dodhi, Pala and Amli. Brother, are they players or their attributes? Shut up. There you go. Now I will introduce you to the English team. This is how their team goes. Now do I have to say all the names? You too say a few. There you go then. I am going to introduce you to the English team. V... W... I... First Englishman, second Englishman, third Englishman, fourth Englishman, fifth Englishman... And six other Englishmen, so that means 11 Englishmen. -Yes. -Well done, brother. These English always think... that we Indians can play better than them only on grass and that they are better than us while playing on the turf. That's why Harry has decided that we will play on the turf. So that they don't have any doubts left. The result of the tournament will be based on three matches. Both the teams will play three matches. The team which wins two matches will be declared the winner. Pargat... The stadium is absolutely empty. I'm sure there are a few people in our village who are sitting idle. Today, even idlers are busy. Cricket match. Why is that man whistling at me? Brother, the match has begun. Without our permission? -No! -Brother, the match ended as well! Good job, brother. Don't worry. We will score a goal in the next match. Play carefully! What? Two goals in two minutes? They have got an opportunity. Albeit thanks to the English player's mistake. Yes. Let's see. Go! Go! Go! Go for it, Fateh! Hit it hard, Fateh! Should we stay or leave? Let's go and watch cricket? Don't worry. They have just scored two goals so far. There's the third one. Well played. Well played. Very good. Well played, Fateh. Congratulations. That's what I am going to tell you. Hey, pass the ball. Grewal, lift it. Pass the ball to Amli. Come on. Go for it. Take it. No, our players have no spark in them. We should follow my advice of watching the cricket match instead. Let's go? I think the English players are playing amongst themselves. I've only seen the Sansarpur team talking or arguing with each other. True. Look at that. Amli! Come forward! So, what do you say? They might not have the fire but they do have a spark in them. Yes. Brother? You don't need to get so emotional. They scored only one goal whereas the English team scored four. You are feeling embarrassed? You should. Remember the game you played in the last 35 minutes. Maybe then you won't feel embarrassed in the next game. Let's go. -Is this necessary? -Of course it is. We are not here to promote you guys. We are here to promote pure clarified butter, black calf pure clarified butter. And whatever little you guys played, it was because of this clarified butter. Got it? Come here, my child. We played because of the clarified butter. Anyway, we saw your black calf more on the ground than the ball. I have made his favorite, rice pudding. I think I have added a little too much sugar in it. It's okay. He likes it sweet. I am taking rice pudding... for my son. My son made everyone shut up. He scored a goal. They all used to taunt me. They used to call me the addict's mother. My son scored a goal. One goal. My son scored a goal. Ginni scored. I have made rice pudding for Ginni and my other boys. Thank you for the trouble you took, aunt. They will wipe it out in no time. I know my army. I too know my village. There will be a lot coming for them. It's too sweet, mother. You always said I added less sugar. You have become a big player now. You should always play like this in the future. I will play even better than this. I have made you suffer a lot. I have troubled you a lot. Right? You used to always look down and walk out of the house because you thought that people would say, "Look, that's the addict's mother." You no longer need to look down. You should now leave the house with your head held high. Because you are now Ginni left out's mother, Ginni striker's mother. By the way, the sugar in it is just right. I've come to know the value of respect, coach. I no longer need this. Please take it back, it's a request. Can you two come out for just a second? Let's go. Hey, Harry! You are a very good player, but you are just an okay coach. Right. Tomorrow morning, 4:00 a.m., You cannot lose and give up You have to win No one should be able to stop you Run like the wind Don't feel low boys, make some noise Play a game that everybody enjoys It's time for you to give it your best And work harder It's time for you to give it your best... Come on, keep it up. It's time for you to give it your best And work harder You have only 16 yards and five players to stop the ball. -Fateh. The speed of your push... -Yes. ...shall decide how much time you give the scorer to set his angle. One day everyone shall be proud of you The world will rejoice your victory They will welcome you with open arms One day you too will shine brightly The world will then belong to you They will welcome you with open arms Make a record no one can break To win, give whatever it takes It's time for you to give it your best And work harder It's time for you to give it your best And work harder Brother, what is he saying? Tell them what you said. Did you understand? I just understood "home." Coach, he understood home. Now we go back home... only after winning the match. Do you remember the last 35 minutes of the last match? Yes, we do. That is how you have to play these 70 minutes today. No one comes to watch them play hockey during the day and this match is taking place at night. This is cheating. To all those who didn't come to watch the match, I, the commentator forced to be here, welcomes you. There is no one here to listen to me but I will continue the tradition anyway. I would like to tell the spectators that there has been no changes made in Sansarpur's team today. How can there be any changes, brother? These are the same great warriors who were wiped out by white players on a bright sunny day. Dodhi... Baba... Baba! Yes! That's Punjab's first goal made in the first minute. Brother, let's make sure they didn't hit it in our own side. It's the referee who is making sure of that. You should look at the scoreboard. The atmosphere in the stadium is now at its best. The England players are abusing each other in English. Thank God they are doing it in English. If they were saying it in Punjabi, then it would have changed the atmosphere of the ground. -Grab it. -Good. Yes, yes. Back off. Keep strong, stay strong. -Not good, boys! -Okay, the score is tied now. England one, Punjab one. Brother, I think now England will keep scoring goals nonstop. Stay away. -What's this? -I know their tactics. They did the same thing with Holland in the last World Cup. This is nothing new. They are only doing this to break the confidence of our team. Come on! -Hey! -Go for it! Well done! Boys from our village are playing hockey! Come out! Boys from our village are playing hockey! Let's go! Boys from our village are playing hockey! Let's go watch them play! Come with me! I think I am having trouble seeing. Look over there! Spectators are rushing into the stadium. Brother, there are many who do sleepwalking. Shut up. I think Fateh's goals have attracted people from Mithapurm, Khusropur, Kartarpur and other neighboring villages. Brother, the way people are filling up the stadium, we can now proudly say that the stadium is filled with spectators. -Here, Goddess's lion has also joined us. -Hail the Goddess! I mean it has come to the stadium. And also the guy who distributes the offerings. Forget about the offerings. I think as the number of spectators rises, The Punjab's pressure on the game is also rising. No! England scored another goal and once again tied the match. There are only a few minutes left in the game. Punjab needs a miracle to win this match. A miracle is required here. Ask the Englishmen to go away! Ask the Englishmen to go away! Ask the Englishmen to go away! -Dodhi! -Come on, Dodhi! Yes! -Yahoo! -We did it! You now have the reins to the country You can either help it progress or ruin it You now have the reins to the country You can either help it progress or ruin it Be one with the ground Fill the stadium with power Oh my dear country Oh my dear country Now hockey will score! Oh my dear country Oh my dear country It will reign some more! Oh my dear country The whole team got a new lease on life after winning the second match. Now it was time for the last and final match. I didn't even tell you. Then how did you know that I needed you? You needed me, right? After losing the second match, Coach Clayton went back to his evil cruel tactics. Once again he decided to injure the players. He targeted all the main players of Punjab. He said that it is important that they break our team. And this time, his target was Dodhi. This sight is worth watching. With the number of spectators here for the match, this looks more like a funfair than a hockey match. People have come here in tractors and trolleys. And then there are also those in cycles who have come here holding the sides of trolleys to enjoy the match. Going by the number of news channel reporters here, it's not just Fateh or Harry, or Punjab's honor that is at stake anymore. Our country's honor is at stake now. Do you know about sportsman spirit? I have heard the world say... that victory and defeat... are an integral part of the sportsman's life just like dawn and dusk. When you accept your defeat with honor, it is called sportsman spirit. But I don't believe in that. Why does an army enters a battleground? To win. Only to win. To win it at any cost. Does the army give up just because it is tired, injured or out of ammunition? Did they accept losing? Never! They win, at any cost and any condition. For their country, for their family, for their Punjab. That's how a sportsman is too when he enters the ground. And that for me is the sportsman spirit. At least for me this is what it means. If anyone feels that this is my personal challenge to that team, then he should not play today. If anyone thinks that this is Fateh's personal fight with that team, then he should not play today. If anyone thinks that he is doing a favor to our village, our Punjab, then he should not play today. If you don't think you are a team then you won't win. Each one of you is a team. Dodhi, you are a team. Pala, Panchi, Fateh... Each of you is a team. A team of 11 players. Players step inside a ground for their honor, for their passion, for the fire in them. Players don't win the game, the fire in them does. Their passion wins. The thirst to prove themselves wins. -Do you have that passion in you? -Yes, I do! -Do you have the desire? -Yes, I do! -Do you have the thirst? -Yes, I do! Then go and show it to those Englishmen! Dear God, grant my request so that... I may never deviate from doing good deeds! That I shall have no fear of the enemy when I go into battle! With determination, I will be victorious! "With determination, I will be victorious!" With determination, I will be victorious! With determination, I will be victorious! With determination, I will be victorious! With determination, I will be victorious! Friends, we know how eager all of you are to watch today's match. But we are waiting for a special guest. For the world, hockey is just another game. But for Punjabis, it is an emotion. It doesn't matter whether it's on this side of the border or on the other side. Please welcome Mr. Parvez Rana from Lahore, Pakistan. Welcome, Mr. Rana. -Greetings. -Greetings. -Greetings. -Greetings. Come on. -Before the partition... -Here. In undivided India, his father used to play with Major Dhyan Chand. And he too played in Pakistan's team. And now his children continue with the tradition. Thank you very much. Our country was formed in the year 1947. The friends who used to play together got divided into two different teams. The colors of our jerseys changed. But the hearts of those who played hockey didn't change. In the year 1948, during the London Olympics, when India defeated England, it was the Pakistani team who applauded the most in the stadium. Back then, I was just a small child... when I witnessed that moment. Today, I am once again that small child and I want to live that same moment again. That same moment... Each tear is a prayer for the wellbeing of both Punjab. Thank you, Mr. Parvez Rana. The match begins. Both teams are quite enthusiastic. Which team takes the lead in the match will be decided by the first goal. England's team always likes to build the pressure from the very beginning. And this style suits them. But the running clock is always with that team, which is ahead at running score. England is trying its best to take the lead in the game. Punjab's defense is much better than before. There, they break through their defense and score a goal! England scores the first goal in this match. England team's Coach Clayton is quite pleased with his team. And Punjab's coach Harry looks a little disappointed. It's halftime and the score is 1-0. England maintains its lead. But in the end, it all comes down to the game each team plays. On one hand, we have players from England who are quite skilled and on the other hand, there's Punjabi blood, who have hockey in every pore of their body. Our elders still remember the time when their sisters used to stitch a ball for them with rags. Happy honestly feels that if the person suggested by him cannot do the job, then he will do the job himself. -Who is Happy? -Me. First get rid of your ego. I once again feel like playing hockey. Please let me play. Coach... Come on. The score during halftime is 1-0. That means England is leading and now the pressure is on Sansarpur, Punjab. Players use up most of their strength during the first half. There is just one thought that keeps him going. That fate won't decide who will win, his prowess will. Right? Without a doubt, Punjab's teamwork is much better than before. And they are filled with passion and determination as well. But because of their skill and their experience, England has been always proving that they are better. England scored another goal. England two, Punjab zero. Hey, where you off to? Sorry, brother. I think Harry and Fateh are coming up with a new strategy. Will you be able to play outside? Leaving the goal open? Not just the goal but that as well. Yes, brother. Good. He is making the goalkeeper stand outside. Very few people know this rule in hockey. And it is rarely used as well. You are absolutely right. -The benefit of that is... -Buck up! Buck up! You get one extra player than the other team. And the disadvantage is that once the defense line is crossed, the other team scores. Another excellent move by Dodhi, a player from Punjab. Fateh! A new pass, right to the center of D. Fateh deflects with a great dive. And he scores a goal! Yeah... By the way, such a risky decision can be taken only for two reasons. Either out of fear or out of greed. Or for some other reason. It's now or never. -Pressure them. -Okay, the referee has indicated a foul. It is a clear foul. But England's jersey number 13, Billbong, is arguing with the referee. He is trying to defend himself. But the referee has given a short corner to Punjab. Fateh is ready to push. Dodhi dodged instead of going for a direct hit and he scored! Yes. Yes! It's a goal. Brother, shall I go back to the goal? No. Think it over, brother. We have equaled the score to two each. Your planning succeeded. I think we shouldn't leave the goal vulnerable anymore. If a lion worries about his den when he goes out to hunt, then there won't be any difference in a lion's den and a mouse's burrow. Keep playing. -Wait, I'll teach you a lesson. -Hey, stop it. Jonathan... Oh no, Punjab's player, Baba, has been injured. He has been a pillar for his team. Baba? You alright? This is against sportsman spirit. A deliberate act. If Baba, who has been playing well, leaves the ground, then it would affect Punjab's team in a bad way. We will have to take him to the hospital right away. Doctor, at an age when people play cards at the village square, I got injured in a ground. I am requesting you, there are only 20 minutes left in the game. If you let me stay in the ground, then perhaps it won't hurt me much. -Baba, are you alright? -Yes, I am fine. Remember, your jersey has written Fateh (victory) on it. Don't forget that. Yes! This is how a sportsman behaves! You now have the reins to the country You can either help it progress or ruin it You now have the reins to the country You can either help it progress or ruin it Be one with the ground Give it here. Fill the stadium with power And here is Oh my dear country... Punjab scores this time. Now hockey will score! Oh my dear country Oh my dear country -Fateh and Harry are celebrating. -It will reign some more! Oh my dear country... Thank you, God. His bravery worked well. Yes, indeed. -But it was quite risky, wasn't it? -That is true. At the moment, Punjab is leading the scoreboard. I think Punjab is just a few minutes away from its victory. But only if their difference in the scoreboard is maintained. That's why the boys are just hitting the ball around to kill the time. The referee indicates a foul. While tackling Jordan, player number five, Singh made a mistake. A short corner can prove to be dear to them. And England scores another goal! This short corner proved to be dear to Punjab. Yeah! And England tied the score by scoring this goal. Yes! Yes! It can be said that he's going crazy with happiness. Yes, he is bound to feel this way. Yes! If England hadn't scored this goal, then they would have lost this match. And we have heard that Coach Clayton doesn't like losing. England's team is surprised by their coach's behavior. England's players are taking Coach Clayton out of the ground. Okay now the winner of the match will be decided through penalty shootout. That means now both the teams will have five penalty strokes each. And that will decide who wins this match. As per the new rules, the striker will have eight seconds to score a goal. Jordan will be the goalie for England. And Punjab's Grewal is the striker. Let's see whether or not Grewal is successful in helping his team score the first penalty stroke. There you go. Punjab fails to score a goal. Grewal missed his target. Ruff from England's team will now take the penalty stroke. And the goalkeeper before him is Happy. And a goal! -Ruff has scored a beautiful goal. -Yeah! At the moment, England is leading Punjab, 4-3. Punjab's next striker is Dodhi. He has been in very good form since the last match. Jordan is very good at defending the goal. Yes. There you go, an unbelievable goal by Dodhi. Dodhi is signing to Coach Clayton. One of the best players of England, Hackon. It is obvious that Happy is under pressure. And a goal! England succeeds in scoring a goal from its second penalty stroke as well. England once again is leading Punjab. Now it's Punjab's turn to strike. And the name of the player who is going to take this penalty for Punjab is Singh. The next striker is Billbong. Happy needs to stop this goal at any cost. If Punjab doesn't stop this goal, then they might lose. And Punjab saved a goal! Punjab is still in the game. Punjab's fourth striker is Amli. There you go, another new move by Fateh. Baba is walking onto the ground. Baba stares at Clayton. Then moving on, he greets the player who... ...had hit him. You now have the reins to the country You can either help it progress or ruin it You now have the reins to the country You can either help it progress or ruin it Be one with the ground Fill the stadium with power Oh my dear country Oh my dear country Now hockey will score! Oh my dear country Oh my dear country It will reign some more! After this goal by Baba, both the teams' scores are once again tied. England's next striker is on the ground. And Punjab's goalkeeper Happy saves yet another goal. Punjab's next striker is the captain himself, Fateh. Now the goalkeeper Happy is facing his biggest challenge ever. Yes, it is vital for Happy to stop Jonathan. The score is once again tied. Now this is a situation of sudden-death. That thrilling aspect in the game of hockey wherein anything and everything is possible. Both the teams get one chance each. The team that scores first wins. The other team won't get another chance to come back. And the sudden-death begins. The first player from England is Jonathan. Let me remind everyone that Jonathan is the same player who has never missed a goal in the past three matches. Are you ready? Punjab is still in trouble. Destiny is favoring Punjab this time. They get another chance. Listen to me... don't go for reverse. You won't go for reverse, okay? Dodhi, don't you think that's too much pressure? I'm too scared. There are a lot of expectations from Captain Fateh Singh... The whole stadium and all of Sansarpur has expectations from him. The whole team and us too. Don't go for reverse, Fateh! You now have the reins to the country You can either help it progress or ruin it You now have the reins to the country You can either help it progress or ruin it Be one with the ground Fill the stadium with power Oh my dear country Oh my dear country Now hockey will score! Oh my dear country Oh my dear country It will reign some more! Oh my dear country That day, Coach Harry saw Captain Fateh win a hockey tournament. But that day a younger brother saw his elder brother win over something even more greater. Let the blazing sun rise Teach a lesson to those Who don't know how to lose Let the blazing sun rise Teach a lesson to those Who don't know how to lose To those who know their limits And to those who don't Who's here to stay And who's here to leave The brave doesn't worry about such things He only knows victory belongs to Lord Blessed are those Oh my dear country Now hockey will score! It will reign some more! Now hockey will score! It will reign some more!
