You're not in the central file or the support groupof Nanterre. Who are you? Person. Not search. You will find that shit. - You are summoned to BRB (Banditry Repression Brigade). Urgently. - Was raked the area three times. We all have alibis. What more? - Yes, everything was squared. Must return. Christian think There is an accomplice. What's going on? Gang war. Those who attacked the van have steered their hideout in Suresnes. Two million euros. We had to identify. We found marked money. Three corpses. - How many ? - Six, according to witnesses. Five outside, a driver in a minivan. Tinted windows, without registration. Why called me? - The only clues, is these cartridges. You've already seen that? No. * - The number you have composed; not attributed. * The number you have composed not attributed ;. * The number you have... fuck his mother. Son of a bitch. Who is that, you? * - Vincent? - Hello, Christian? * - A robbery gone wrong, in Sartrouville. * I need your opinion. Can you come now? OK, I come. Ciao. Suresnes team did again, but bigger. Did they? Men of Malik al-Sadr. That's delivery to go fast that was typed in 2 big cars. - There is nothing to exploit. No footprints. Nothing beyond the cords. The indices are in the area. Good. It is only on the spot? - Why You took this job? It overlaps with job of Suresnes. Don't know it's the same. - Same cartridges that were used. They are unique. Known a team that uses them. - Any idea who may be? - To me, It's cops or soldiers. Veterans or still active. - How can you be sure? - Nine bodies, nine modified sockets. It's the sharp shot. The arrangement of sockets "L". These guys tended straight ambush. A assault tactic called "L formation". A group advance frontally on target And one walke by side to cover it. This rigor only learnt from the army. Or from police. Good. Go to work. Come see. I would detach you to BRB. You're a ballistics expert. Passed the scientific, will be free. We will win forever. Without experience, I can't help you. - But if. You do nothing but analyzing a distorted bullet. That's all, see that. Yes, but it's not my place here. And Ricaud. I had him ipa fl é your temporary assignment. He agreed. Only you missing here. I need you, great. - OK. Shut up. And above all, don't be smart ass. Look at me when I talk to you. OK? You've seen this cartridge? - They've already shaken them. If they knew they have spit it out. Search more at home. There is one avenue to explore. Private manufactures. I've tried. Pardon me? I've looked, it gave nothing. When you did that? When you show me the sockets, I checked it. You couldn't tell us? Share info. like this at home, D'ont forget that. Agreed? Checks the file of dirty cops written off . Christian should not glue yourself to us. You're not a cop, or an investigator. You're just a kid fixing guns. You're afraid losing your place to a 22-year old kid? That's an insult. We are not in kindergarten. Alright, Joseph. I have not put 2O years to get there. Hey, hey! Calm down! He is there to help us. We support you because we have to. But watch out. Let me go, please. Anything! But you have 2 years? You have a woman in your life? - No. No girlfriend? You don't want? No. Someone to talk to. Someone waits for you. - No. - You don't like I ask you this? What is it? You're shy? - You have a daughter? I have a 5 year old girl, very cute. Her name? Hello. Good Morning. What do you do? I draw. You catch the wicked with mom? Yes. - Good. I present Angel Carmini. Former commander of the defunct regional brigade of investigation and coordination. Laid off there for 1O years for firearm trafficking. Ace of shooting and knowledge of ballistics. I know him in IGS (internal affairs) (Inspection Général des Services) It fell on him to use socket head bullets. It give in armed robberies? - Several times worried, never condemned. If we prove his involvement in these attacks, it risks life time. With luck and pressure to reduce his sentence, he'll swing his accomplices. Questions? - No. No. We'll tighten tomorrow early morning at home. OK, buddy? Well, it jammed 2 times. It's supposed to be new, that stuff. Any progress? No. The evening of your car-jacking, I haven't called you back. Then you didn't answered. Why? No, I don't want to. I can't think now. Vincent. If you recognize the guys who did that, I can handle it. - OK. OK. Have you kept the picture of us? It was a dirty time for me. Big guys tranferred me form street to desk to hide myself. Because of what? I made mistake. I was captain. What kind of bullshit? Kind that's worth jail time or coffin. How do you get out? I turned my mistakes into opportunities. I was ingenious. I become commander again. Everyone was happy, except Christian. There was no evidence, but he harassed me. They sent me away so he'd forget me. When I returned, Christian had calmed down. Why? They tempted him... the commander job of BRB. Like what... Everything has a price. Everything. Vincent... You're a good guy. The bullshit improved something but it can be expensive. Well... If you need me, you know where to find me. Later! He groaned. Fracas (noisy quarrel nois). - Police! Don't move! Let go all! Thank you, gentlemen. - What do you want? You know why you're... Course he knows it. Right, angel? Start the search. Vincent, you searched the room? Uh, no. " - Where were you in afternoon of April 12 and on the night of April 16 to 17? -You participated in Suresnes hold-up . And attack go fast Sartrouville. You let nine guys on the floor. We know you're behind all this. I think Denard teamed with you. - To corner Denard you are here? You have no proof. They are the same? Hum. Boarding. It suffocates. "Isa! Shit Joseph calls EMS Look at my eyes. Breathe gently. No... Isa Isa? Damn! Forgive me, Isa. Forgiveness. - Investigation must continue. - It is known that Carmini manufactured cartridges. Let down his accomplices. Luc Denard and the guys of BRI (Anti-gang). Disapproval exclamations - No, it's not possible! You go again? They were related. When his brigade disappeared, they went to join Denard. The cases where Carmini was suspected entrusted to BRI (Anti-gang) and closed without follow up. Bell rang. Courage. Hi. Thank you. Condolences, Christian. You pay me this death, Denard. You know that I have nothing to do with it. - You have nothing to do with Carmini robbery? It is classified, that case. Really? I will put the right time. But I will bring you down. If the kid was in my team, he would be alive. Clear it. Shut up. Luke, please. Good. We are gathered to pay the last respects to Captain Isabelle Lefranc. A exceptional woman, a wife, a mother, a sister, a friend. Fuck! I can not. - I can not shut up and stop. - An irreplaceable life interrupted too soon. Stop, Christian. The go fast, they leave nine dead. - Stop it, Christian. - It comes strutting. Huh? What to do with the beautiful principles. - Stop. - The Commissioner, raise immunity of BRI (Anti-gang brigade) to this assassin, that junk, pays his crimes. I'll kill you. I will make you pay. There will never arrest him. Stop, Luke. Stop. You don't respect the family. Your has no shame. - She, she was my family. She was a thousand times you. You have no family. You're going to die alone because you have no friends. Uproar You don't need me? If Thank you for stumbling that motherfucker. - To stop Denard, it will be without me. If you refuse, Isa will be dead for nothing. By dropping Luke you won't bring her back. You have a crush on, that whore of Denard. I learned more with him in a year than 15 years with you. That's what you think. Hello? * - Ricaud. It's crap. He is short of guns. * For inventories, I need the original paper of goods issues. Ok, I'm on it. Fucking Chavez. I have nothing to do with it. He would'n let me go, I tell you. I'm hungry. - Damn! Order in Arabic. Police siren - Are you done readings? - We can transmit. - Can you deal with it? It was sealed with what? 5, 56 regular. We know who made it? You. What do you mean? You accused Denard pointe the gun the go fast, in front of the whole world. The Arabic phone has done the rest. Malik Al-Sadr's operating way. That's what happens to those who attacked his network. You collided? Denard's team arrives. Break yourself. Chavez, motherfucker! You killed them! Guys... It's your fault! Yes, hello? * - You don't manage, there. Hide evidence at Carmini place, You have nothing, understand? What are you doing? Listen to me. You belong to me. Understand? So, no initiatives. * - You're sick. * I will go and tell all to Christian. The more you will bring back, the more you sow corpses. This time, I am not there to clean up. Milo hangs up. My transfer order. You have to sign it. I return to the armory. I have nothing to do here. What's the matter? Here, look. A friend from Interpol had sent me info. Carmini was unable to commit attacks Suresnes and Sartrouville he was seen in Spain. Carmini has nothing to do with it. Neither does Denard. I was wrong. How about the silly cartridges at his house? There is little time to know who fucked us. A ticket of the attack at Suresnes surfaced. It is great, that one. My great, you're going nowhere as we are not at the end. The Derkaoui brothers. Ta rek and Kais. They paid with a ticket of attack of Suresnes. Morons! They were in the special action group. Elite group of Algerian army. They traffic dope and robbery. They linked to Carmini or BRI (Anti-gang)? No, not that I know. Vincent. If it slips in. Don't hesitate. Celebrate. OK. That him who shot Carmini. You know? Yeah. The Derkaoui. It's a "headache". Where do they live? Anything for me? A hideout, it's new. They are shielded brown and MDMA (drug). MDMA, is for little girls. I want something more. What? Approach. I have delivery in 3 days. Doing yourself for my comfort. Let it be done in calm and serenity. - I'll do what I can. In Arabic The Derkaoui have several hideouts. If I were you, I'll make a tour to 215, rue Colbert, Clichy. You wish, you are not wrong . Hey, oh. The Derkaoui is heavy. At your place, I'll go with ninjas. I don't want to lose you. They laugh. One can know why? Yeah? You know the names of those that fart in BAC (plain uniform criminal police)? - No. - The skulls. - Skulls? Do not rely on RAID (anti-terrorist police). They are secured to the BRI (Anti-gang brigade). - We already had enough problems. Let's drop it. No, I'm after. Yeah? How you shall make without RAID? They are neutralize ourselves. Are you kidding? - With a sharp-shooter, rubber bullets and surprise, that can do it. It is suicidal. We don't come there. - No, we don't. Vincent, yes. I know that it is capable. You're in apartment. We, in the hallway. You shake them. We lock the exits. You feel it or not? Hum. So? We lost Isabelle. It's not enough? You have another idea? Shut up. You don't care? And you say nothing. I can do that. - Don't you see that It's a suicide? You see, he gets crazy? He'll go to the end. He's ready to kill you with his bullshit. All because he wants to stop the earth and save the world. 15 years I spend my days with him. You think he asks me how I am? He asks you- how are you? If you please, stop. Frankly. Christian is my friend. I'd pull the legs for him. But no kidding, it sucks. This story Denard, it continues. It makes him crazy. You saw him in funeral? Music intriguing You can still refuse. There is one hour before he came with authorization paper. Worrying Music You know him? - No, I thought. - Here, rubber-bullet gun. It's insane. If things went wrong? D'ont worry for me. distant Conversation They speak Arabic. The Derkaoui guffawed. Grunts Barking - Police! Drop your weapons! -Good. Do not shoot. We give up. Vincent, good. They give up. Do what needed to be done. Now, stand up. - That's the ticket of Suresnes. The numbers correspond. Nicolas confirmed that the dope comes from Malik Al-Sadr network. A phone rings. What's going on? It's Ricaud. I understood why you avoided me . * It's you who stole the guns. * You erased your tracks. With respect of Chavez, You have a choice. Either you give it up and come to the office, or I send in PJ (Police Judiciare = FBI). - He was released? He arrives. - I have the dope, and money of go fast. I don't care! Classified? Classified what? Are you kidding? The Commissioner ordered Derkaoui released. He leaves, explain with him. Police siren Christian! Screeching tires You're crazy? Get the hell out! Who is it with you? Listen to me! Get yourself out. It's fucking serious! Come down. It's serious! - What's the matter? Why you come to piss me off? My fault. What you mean? Isa, and all... Isa what? Her death, the Derkaoui, all that happened. What are you saying? What happened, all my fault. What have you got? Damn... Come,. What is going on? Quiet. Get back. It's OK. You do not understand. It's my fault. If everyone died, my fault. Because of me. What u mean? Come. Come in the car. Dark Music What did you do? I assume all. I dare not tell you because... I will do what he asks me. - No. You'll do what I tell you. By the order of the Commissioner, I am classifying this case. And Milo, will find him together. This case will stay between us. If was closer to you, it wouldn't have happened. I'm sorry, Vincent. Forgive me. Christian ! Christian! Fuck! Fuck! They speak Arabic. Panic cry Cry of pain - Where are the Derkaoui? Where are they? Give me the address. Kiss my ass. Give me the address! Give me. Damn, give! It's OK. OK, OK. I am protected. I am protected. Bangs and cries of pain Come here. Don't move. Shut up. Shut up! Look at me. The guy who passed this morning, Milo, what you know about him? You know what? Fuck you! What you know about him? What you know ? What you know, dirty shit? Wait, wait. Speak. Speak! I freed him on the go fast Sartrouville. Where can I find him? I'll tell you. Crackling rain No, no, don't do it! Gunshot * - You compromises our mission. Kill a commander! It would be wound up to us. * - Why are you hard with this kid? * You lost control and it's not the 1st time. Few days from now, it will be ready. * - You failed. Let it go. It's an order. Listen, I manage. Alright? Leave it for me. What you think you're, motherfucker? Who are you? Cry of Pain You killed Chavez? - I told you - shut up. Come on, get up. You really understood nothing. I have made you a war weapon. Join me. You have no choice. Moan. Look at me. Gunshot Creaking Door Milés. Get dressed. - Mr. Milés. Sit down, please. You are serving a criminal sentence. Presidential pardon is for your. It can take effect immediately. I command a special unit annexed to French army. Our mission is to intervene outside of legal system. We do not exist officially. To eradicate terrorism, we use methods our governments can not condone publicly. Recover the money from robbers Suresnes was a means to gather the funds necessary for our operation. Go fast attack was our 1st mission. We had to destroy a network that financially supported international terrorism. I have my eye on you from the competition. I hope Milo find the words to rally yourself to us. When he proposed buying your explosive cartridges probably too hurry, You cut the bridges. Milo had carte blanche to make you change opinion. It went wrong. I regret. Commit yourselves to us and you leave jail. I want you under my command, Vincent. Edited and details info. by VNCH -- NGOC TRUONG --
