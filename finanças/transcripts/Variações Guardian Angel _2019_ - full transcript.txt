A FILM BY JOAO MAIA Fiscal Village, Amares, 1956 GUARDIAN ANGEL Let's go, Toninho. People who wash in the river Who carve with your ax The boards to make my coffin There might be those who defend you Let's get to work. You're only leaving once you finish all those pieces and sweep the floor. And hurry up! People who wash in the river Who carve with your ax The boards to make my coffin There might be those who defend you Who buy your sacred ground But not your life I don't want to go work in the factory, Mom. - I want to go to Lisbon. - Please, stop that Lisbon talk. Shut up and eat. Loosen up. Hold the cavaquinho straight. Loosen up, use only one finger. Lisbon, 1983 I only know I am weed Grassy weed spreading... I only know I am weed Grassy weed spreading I only know I am weed Grassy weed spreading Husk, thunder... The husk threatens the thunder The sickly sweet grass I don't know If I wish to escape this animal This animal I've been searching for Interpret it as you wish I've never been good at haggling I don't know if I wish to increase it Because I don't know Because I don't know Because I don't know If I wish to be polished up I don't know If I wish to soften my sharp edges I also don't know If I wish to escape this animal This animal Because I don't know If I wish to be polished up I don't know If I wish to soften my sharp edges I've never been good at haggling - Isn't that Variagdes? - Yes. Give me a kiss, darling. - Have a nice day. Thank you. - Nice to meet you. Thank you. I only know I am weed - Mr. Variagbes? - You want my autograph? - What's your name? - Guilherme. "Guilherme..." "A hug from António Variagdes." - How long will you stay in New York? - A week. I fly out tomorrow, back next Friday. I have gigs booked for the weekend. - In New York? - No, I wish! - Matilde, where am I singing? - Vila Franca and Tomar. Matilde is my appointment book. Aren't you going to look for something in New York? - No... - Get an agent? No, I'm just going to get some rest. Get ready for the summer. I've got 80 gigs booked. You think you'll get some rest in New York? At least I can walk around without being recognized. - Are you fed up with fame already? - No, not fed up. But sometimes it's nice to lay low. 1977, six years earlier These are the old prophecies Left behind by the fortune teller To frighten us I can see life escaping From the effort of resisting It can no longer breathe From the sky I can see the end Coming down in burning containers I can hear the earth exploding Oh but I'm delirious ZÃ©. ZÃ© António! - What? - Listen to this. What do you think? I thought it was very... Who is he? I don't know. I don't know yet... You're Portuguese, aren't you? Yes, I am. And you? I'm Brazilian, but I've been living in Lisbon for a long time. Really? I lived over there for a long time too. - Do you want one? - No, thanks. You don't drink, you don't smoke... Sorry, I forgot to introduce myself. Luis Vitta. I'm a music journalist, I work for Renascenga radio. - Nice to meet you, I'm António. - I know. I think you're very talented. I might be the only one at the radio station who thinks that, but the truth is I can't stop listening to your tapes. Did you come all the way here just to see me? I wish... No, I'm here for work. I'm covering the Sex Pistols gig. - Can I ask you a question? - Sure. - Why didn't you sing in Portuguese? - Here? I've tried, nobody cares. How do you make a living here? I'm a barber. Really? - What do you do at the radio station? - I've a show, 'Meia de Rock'. - You might have heard it... - Sure I have. That's what I'd like to do with my music, rock! - But real rock! - I think that's what your music needs. Listen, I know a lot of people at music labels. I don't think it will be hard for you to get a contract. But first I need to get your music on the radio. How did you record those tapes? At home. In the bathroom, I like my voice to echo. - It's stronger, nicer that way. - But we can't play that on the radio. Can't you get some musicians together? Some rock musicians to record... I've tried looking for musicians here, but I can't speak Dutch. I don't know music. The Dutch who do don't get what I'm trying to get across, they don't get me. I think I can sort it out for you, but it'll have to be back in Portugal. Are you okay with that? For my music, I'l go to the end of the world. If I have to go back to Portugal, I will. António? What happened, Mom? Look, Mom, blackberries! How I've missed this! How was the cherry picking this year? Not great. Especially since your father ate tons of them. He did? What about the olives? We didn't get many. How are we going to manage without your father? You're more like your father than you think. He was so proud of you. But he was stubborn. So he never said it. He always thought that one day, if it came to it, you'd be the one looking after our family. Me? But why? Maybe partly because you have a different way of thinking. Sometimes it feels like I never left, Mom. I don't think a day goes by without me remembering the Easter festivals, or our river, the boulders... And the green, Mom, I think about the green so often. What is it, Toninho? Is life over there not going your way? It is, Mom. I'm a barber, I've made friends... Everything's okay. Are you happy? I don't know if I was born to be happy. I like this or that equally. What's 'that'? Holland, or anything else... Don't you go to church? Over there, churches are different from ours. They're Protestant. What does that mean? They're a different type of Christian. Churches there don't have statues of the Virgin Mary or the saints. That's what I like the most about going to church. To sit there looking at all that. What do you do then? Don't you pray? You pray for me, Mom, I'm sure. Every night, right? Mr. António... There's a man on the phone for you. He says you're a musician? António, it's me, Vitta. These are the musicians I told you would play with you. - This is Z& António. - Nice to meet you. This is Frederico. They play the bass. Shall we go? - That one was here yesterday. - Right... It's true! I recognized it because of its patch on... A ring - a ring of roses Laps full of posies Awake - awake! Now come and make A ring - a ring of roses Laps full of posies Awake - awake! Now come and make I lost my memory My thoughts... I lost my memory I lost my memory My thoughts grew cloudy I can't tell my story I lost the reason of time And the mirror... And the mirror cracked I don't know where I am I don't know whether I'm young or old I don't know what I am All I have in my frame Is this vision So many eyes staring At my hand There's no signal or position No notion of good or evil I bear no signs of loneliness Nor laughter of emotion Stop, stop. The drums are not right. The drums are fine, you're the one who's not right. That's right, António. There's something you need... - It's the rhythm. - Exactly. You need to get the rhythm right. Do you know what this is? It's a drum machine. Basically you pick your rhythm. Press play. And here you can speed it up. Speed up or slow down. The important thing is to stick to the rhythm. That's right. If we're going to play and record together, you have to sing in the right tempo. I can see the sea growing A giant wave sweeping All I can see are floating bodies Oh but I'm delirious What am I making up? Your hair became my banner Your body became my standard I lost my memory My thoughts grew cloudy I lost my memory My thoughts grew cloudy You look beautiful, Gena. - Take care. - I'll be with you in a second. António, don't you want to work extra hours? - Ramiro, no more hours this week. - Not this week, next week. You've been bring in customers, you could earn a lot more. I'll think about it. - Dol - Okay, thanks. - Good afternoon. - Hi. - Renato. - António. Please sit. - Hi. - Hi. What would you like? A haircut? Yes, do whatever you like. I place myself in your hands. These are my friends. - Dino, Lata and Baeta. - Pleasure. Well? - Shall we get to the important stuff? - Yes. You can't mention you write your own songs. I mean, not yet. Let him enjoy your voice first, that'll be good. Okay. António, you need to give it your all, man. This is your one chance. You go in there and give it your all. I mean, don't sing out of tune either. They hate singing out of tune. Game over. - If you're out of tune, it's over. - Alright. - Are you nervous? - No. People who wash in the river Who carve with your ax The boards to make my coffin People who wash in the river Who carve with your ax The boards to make my coffin There might be those who defend you Who buy your sacred ground But not your life But not your life But not Your life Thank you. You've got something. Something different. But we have to work on that tuning. But you could be a modern folk singer. Neofolk. But let's try to move forward and find a song that suits you better. You know, a song that suits you and your striking persona better. We'll only talk about your own songs once we have a well recorded demo. But leave that to me. Because these guys are a pain. They like everything tidy, pretty, in tune. We can't waste this chance, it's a once in a lifetime opportunity. Look, there's your friends. These guys are a corporate bunch. To them, a singer's a singer, a songwriter's a songwriter, a musician's a musician. But what matters now is you have a contract. - That's right, a contract! - I'm going for a walk with them. Don't mention the contract! Wait until we sign it first. - Okay. - Ink on paper, okay? You scared me. So, how's my favorite hairdresser? I'm not a hairdresser, I'm a barber, but okay. - So where are you going? Home? - I'm going for a walk. - Let's go out. Come out with us. - Where are you going? Wait, we'll be there in a minute. - Come dance with me. - Let me go over to the bar first. Then get me a Drambuie. - Tell Gui it's for me. - Okay. Hil - How are you? - Fine. You look great! Have you met António? He's a sweetheart. - Hi. - Pleasure. Hi, Fernando! Get on that dance floor soon or you might not get to take Rosa Maria home. I'm coming. Fernando. António. Yes, it's me. Is it really you? I didn't recognize you, I thought you were dead! Don't be melodramatic. Are you by yourself? No, I'm with my wife. Rosa. Rosa? Rosa Maria is your wife? Congratulations, she's beautiful. Thanks. - You know, I fell in love. - Good for you, I'm happy for you. That's really good. What have you been up to? It's all good. The salon's doing well. I'm thinking of opening a club. It's all good. When did you get back? A few days ago, for my dad's funeral, and I decided to stay a bit longer. - I'm really sorry. - Thanks. When are you going back to Holland? I'm not sure... I have some projects over here. You still smell really nice. Rosa. Is this the António you told me about? Yes, this is the António who worked for me until he left without a trace. Shall we get some supper later? I want to know all about the famous António who left without a trace. Sure, I'd love to. So, what's the deal? Can I tell her everything? Only the part about you leaving without a trace. - She knows everything else. - She does? Everything? Enough. So do you want to be famous or be a singer? I want to be known in a way that people want to come to gigs where I am the show. - And what will you sing? - My own songs. Did you learn music? No. I'll show you how it's done later. And while the music stuff doesn't take off? I'm cutting hair at the Isabel Queiroz do Vale salon. Really? - At Imaviz? - That's right. Exactly how long have you been back? About a month... You've been back for a month? But what I'd really like is to open a local barber shop and charge 250 escudos a cut, but only by appointment! No one pays 250 escudos to get their hair cut. You're such a pessimist. Of course they do! If they pay for nights out, they pay to get their hair cut. Because it's not just about cutting hair, it's almost like a party, a celebration. This isn't Amsterdam. This is Lisbon, buddy. Things are very different here, I don't know if you can adjust. Who said I want to adjust to Lisbon? It's Lisbon who'll need to adjust to me. - A toast to your success. - A toast. I have an angel A guardian angel To protect me night and day I have an angel A guardian angel To protect me night and day I can't see him I can't hear him But I can always feel him near me I have a guardian Who is an angel To protect me night and day Anytime, anywhere I can count on his close watch He doesn't use guns He doesn't use force He uses a light To shine on my life He doesn't use guns He doesn't use force He uses a light To shine on my life Thank you very much, have a good afternoon. Mr. António Ribeiro. Please, come in. - Excuse me. - Come on in. Good afternoon, António Ribeiro. - Good afternoon. - My name is Tedfilo. Please, have a seat. Here's your contract. Would you read it, please. Is Mr. MÃ©rio Martins here? I think he's recording. Why? Do you need to speak to him? I recorded some of my own songs. I'd really appreciate it if he could listen to them. - Oh, you write songs? - Yes. I wasn't aware... - Let's have a listen. - Sure. I have an angel A guardian angel To protect me night and day I have an angel A guardian angel You're kidding, right? Me? Why? You want to show this to Mr. Mario Martins? That'll be enough for him to cancel your contract. Cancel? Why? The recording is lousy, the musicians are lousy! I'l get new musicians. I can get new ones. It's not your job to get musicians. We'll handle the musicians and your repertoire. Judite, send Mr. CustÃ©dio Tadeu in. António! What did they say? António, speak up! Stop! What do you want, Vitta? - I don't get it. What is it? - What don't you get? No one's rooting for you more than me. You'd rather I'd listened to your demo at the radio station and ignored it, like everyone else did? Is that it? Maybe that would've been better. I have a job, a steady income. And you could've stayed in Holland, cutting hair. Is that what you want? Come with me. Is the light okay? Good. Great. Try it with this. Come on, shoot. That's too much. That's great. Look straight down the lens. Good. Great. We have three poses. What do you want to do? No, António. You'll scare the candidates off from joining the band. Whoever wants to work with me has to take me as I am. Like this! Are you with me or not? Get all of me, Vitta. No, no, not the pants, António, please. - Okay. - We've got it. I'm going to get these developed. That's it. - How much is it? - Twenty-five. CLASSIFIED ADS If you want to find me I'l gladly have tea with you I'm on the side I'm at the place With the bad reputation Damn it. Good afternoon, Mr. António. Is it the end of the month already? End of the month? Today's the 3rd, man! I've been distracted. I'l get the money. Thanks a lot and sorry if I was a little rough earlier. Now you know I'm a man who pays his bills. The phone's ringing, I have to get that. Have a nice day. - Hello? - Hello, Mom. So you still want to become a singer, António? Get me that one, please. - Why, Mom? - Your photo! twas in the paper, asking for musicians to play with you! Have you seen the paper, Mom? Not yet. They're bringing me the paper tonight. "António. Seeks drummer, bass player and guitarist. New rock band.' Good afternoon. I'd like to speak to Mr. António. This is António Ribeiro. I'm calling about the ad. Hi, I'm here I'm not in disguise to fool you I'm not here to please you If you can't tell I'm screaming And if not I'l sing out of tune If that happens Don't think it's wrong The point is to be original I've already begun I'm not in disguise to please you But I'm here to challenge you I'm here to stay I want to stand out I want to be in the papers And the magazines And I'll do it with your help Even if I have to break myself Even if I have to break myself Man, that was really great. But I need to be in the hospital at 8 am tomorrow. Why? Are you sick? No, I'm a doctor. He's a doctor, I sell coffee, Carlos sells stereos and Rui's a student. You're a student, Rui? I'm a barber. I'm António and I honestly think this band could work. I really do. Can we do it again, from the top? Just one more time, is that okay? - Come on. - I really can't, sorry. - Nice to meet you, António. - Thanks anyway. Bye. Thanks. I've got my adrenaline pumping! It went well! I've had a contract with Valentim de Carvalho since last year. What? You have a contract with Valentim de Carvalho? If you have a contract, why don't you play with their musicians? I want to sing my own songs. I don't want to wait for songs that I don't even know if I'l like. - So you're a songwriter? - Yes. Do you have the scores? I don't know music, Jorge. My songs... ... they're all up here. My dream is that one day they'll be better than me. Better than you? Jorge, if this band works and we become friends, you'll see there's a lot more of me in my songs than in myself. Listen to this one... If you want to meet me That's up to you If you want to find me I'l gladly have tea with you I'm on the side I'm at the place With the bad reputation And I feel weird Wait, wait. Good, good, that's it. You got it! If you want to meet me That's up to you If you want to find me I'l gladly have tea with you I'm on the side I'm at the place With the bad reputation And I feel weird That's where I'll be Until I hear from you That's where I'll be Until I hear from you Don't be scared. There are no cops tonight. Benfica are playing. Are you trying to run? Don't you like us? With that outfit and that funny beard? Aren't you Venancio? Don't you remember me, Venancio? We were together in the war. Lobito, 1966. I was in the same squad as Miragaia and Coelho. And that other one you were always with. What was his name? RogÃ©rio, right? What happened to him? RogÃ©rio... RogÃ©rio's dead. Dead? Here or over there? What do you care? I don't. I always thought he was a jerk. Remember that time you two were punished, they didn't let you go into the woods. Why was that, Venancio? That's a lie. That's a lie! Do you miss the war? Do you miss all those men in uniform? The smell of sweat in the barracks! Do you miss it? Do you, motherfucker? António, what happened to you? Who is behind that mirror? Eyes fixed on mine? Someone who came by And left to wander the world I've missed your records. Fernando, where's the merbromin? It's in the bathroom, under the sink. Sorry. - Sorry for what? - For having played this Fado song. The last time I listened to it, I was here with you. That's right. Did you leave some poor bastard hanging in Amsterdam? You did, didn't you? Do him a favor, António. Call him. It's easy. Tell him you won't be back any time soon. So he doesn't wait around for you. I'm sorry. I swear on my soul I never meant to hurt you, Fernando. I swear. Thanks. - How's your music, António? - Good. - I'm rehearsing with a new band. - Really? I know how to convince you I have a way to catch you I know how to convince you I have a way to catch you You'll lose the confidence You'll lose the faith You have in yourself Take a good look at me You'll lose the confidence You'll lose the faith You have in yourself Take a good look at me You can't escape You can't escape You can't You won't resist So start smiling You're trapped in my web You can't escape, oh no You can't escape, oh no You're trapped in my web You can't escape, oh no You can't escape, oh no THE WEB I've a meeting at Valentim tomorrow. I'm taking this with me, okay? Good luck. Mr. Luis Vitta's here. - You can come in. - Thank you. Yes, send me the demo as soon as it's ready. No, I'm the one who approves it. Of course. Bye. Holy Mary, Mother of God... - How have you been? - Very well. And you, sir? Well, thanks. Take a seat. It's complete madness. Our studio is booked up for the next eight months. But I did manage to squeeze in our António. Really? That's wonderful. That's what I was going to suggest to you... As I've said before, António should fit into a folk repertoire, but different from Frei Hermano da Camara. More commercial folk music... More commercial than Frei? Right... Listen to this. What do you guys think? - I don't like it. - Neither do I. - But I don't like folk music. - I do, but not this! - What do you think? - I hated it! - What did they say about "The Web"? - I never got to play it to him. You have no idea what that meeting was like, I couldn't get a word in. That song must be part of their backlist which they have to record, or they'll lose the copyright. Now... He thinks you can turn this into something brilliant. He thinks I can turn this into a hit? Bigger than Frei. If you manage that, it's another open door. After that, we'll have bargaining power and record your songs. RECORDING One, two, three! Take a pill Take a pill Take a pill You'll feel better Take a pill Take a pill Take a pill You'll feel better I know it's bad For this and that Forget that For all the good it'll do you I know it's bad For this and that Forget that For all the good it'll do you - Is that new? -ltis. Man, that's really, really good! Then I'm going to need you to rehearse it a lot, because I've managed to get you a slot at my station's studio on Thursday. But it really needs to be Thursday, because that slot is free and it's impossible to book. - The day after tomorrow? - That's right! I'm on call at the hospital that day. - Can't you skip it? - Skip being on call? I can't say I need to skip it to record a song. You have no respect for Vitta's hard work! António, we love playing with you, but we have our own lives! Music is something we love to do, but we do it as a hobby. But it's not a hobby to me. This is my life, Jorge. António! Fernando... - Hi! Sorry I'm late. - It's fine, thanks for coming. Come with me! Do you like it? I love it. The owner wants to sell. I thought it could be a good deal. How much is he selling for? - He's asking for 200 thousand. - That's a bargain. Right? I think so too. But I only have 100 thousand. Are you going to do any work on it? No, I like it as it is. I thought I'd just buy a few nice things for decor, but otherwise I think I'l leave it as it is. That's good. So, why did you ask me here? I don't know, Fernando. I think I still enjoy sharing things with you. I know you're married and that... But I can't help it. Believe me, if I could go back, I'd do everything differently. I'l lend you the money, António. I didn't bring you here because of the money. Let me finish. I'l lend you the money on one condition. When I open my club, you're doing a live show there. Are those your terms for lending me the money? I'll do the show for free, man! - This place has character! - I like it too. I really do. So we have 99... Any questions? No. Could you help me over there with the chrome steel stuff? - Okay, I'll be there in a second. - Thanks. - I want this spick and span, girls! - Don't push it... You're getting me wet! What kind of loneliness is that That makes you talk to yourself Tell me all about the conversation You're having with yourself What kind of contempt is that That prevents you From looking at anyone Or do you think there isn't Anyone who really sees you What kind of journey is that That has you going in every direction You've been in search of lost dreams Don't open your eyes. Nearly done... There you go! Do you like it? I look like Carl Perkins. Check this out! Finally! That's a great look! - António, you're the best! - I know. Gentlemen, shall we punk? Shall we punk? - Let's go! - Have a nice gig. What kind of madness is that That puts you in disguise Tell me it sets you free From this empty life What kind of distance is that That you carry in your eyes What urge and what rush You want fo reach What kind of journey is that That has you going in every direction You've been in search of lost dreams There goes the madman There goes the demented one There he goes, walking by That's what everybody calls you But you're always elsewhere And they can never reach you But you're always elsewhere And they can never reach you But! am always elsewhere And they can never reach me Congratulations. You're playing really well. - Thanks. - Do you play often? Yeah, we've been playing some street party gigs... We can make a good living from it, actually. - How much do you get paid per gig? - Five thousand escudos. Five thousand? Really? know it's bad For this and that Forget that For all the good itll do you know it's bad For this and that Forget that For all the good itll do you Can you play that? - Who recorded that? - Doesn't matter. Can you? Yes. You're locked up in chains To the shadow beside you You can't erase The scars from your past Which you insist on rejecting But the drugstore cocktail Gets you through one more day Uproot the root from the bottom You'll float above it all You feel nothing of the world The world that does not want you Careful, don't overdo it But if it happens You'll be just another one flipping But if you want to end it It's best to take something Take a pill Take a pill Take a pill You'll feel better Take a pill Take a pill Take a pill You'll feel better I know it's bad For this and that Forget that For all the good it'll do you I know it's bad For this and that Forget that For all the good it'll do you Insist! Take a pill Take a pill Take a pill You'll feel better Take a pill Take a pill Take a pill You'll feel better I know it's bad For this and that Forget that For all the good it'll do you I know it's bad For this and that Forget that For all the good it'll do you ZÃ© António, here you go. What we agreed. Thanks. Take care. I'm going to try to play this on the radio show next week. - I just need to let the label know. - Forget the label. - What about the contract? - What contract, Vitta? I've had a contract for four years, Vittal And what happened so far? Nothing! I didn't even want that record! - António... - Listen, Vitta... You've been an amazing friend, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart for all you've done, but from now on, let's forget the label. From now on, I'm doing things my way. - Can't get your song out of my head. - Really? - Mister? - António. Nice to meet you. - António! - Hi. - Where's Fernando? - He's not home. That's a shame, I'd like him to listen to something. - Come in. - Sorry. How are you? - You look pretty! - Thanks. - How are you? - Fine. Do you know if Fernando will be long? I don't know... Sorry. What did you want to show him? I taped a song I'd really like him to listen to. Doesn't my opinion count? Of course it does, Rosa. We're like family. A slightly dysfunctional family. It's the one we've got... I know you two have a really special relationship... Different from the one he has with his other friends. It's really beautiful. And rare. Would you like to hear the song? I'd rather go to your gig at Trumps. - Where? - Trumps. Trumps? That's the name of our club. Do you like it? Really? Trumps... I like it. It's catchy. Trumps... I really want this club to work out. Rosa... It will. I'l play a gig at Trumps that people will never forget. May 1? Of course. Thank you. Are you ready? Have a good show. Thanks. Good evening. Welcome to Trumps! And now, live for the very first time... António! I lost my memory My thoughts grew cloudy I can't tell my story I lost the reason of time And the mirror cracked I don't know where I am I don't know whether I'm young or old I don't know what I am All I have in my frame Is this vision So many eyes staring At my hand There's no signal or position No notion of good or evil I bear no signs of loneliness Nor laughter of emotion Take a pill Take a pill Take a pill You'll feel better I know it's bad For this and that Forget that For all the good it'll do you know it's bad For this and that Forget that For all the good itll do you I'm going to sing a new song. It's called "Hook Up Song". I hope you like it. It was made with love. You're free and I'm free And there's a whole night ahead of us Why don't we come together Why don't we set off together On the adventure of the senses You're lonely and I'm lonelier You who hold my gaze My hand is open Waiting to close Around your deserted hand Come, for love Is not about time And it's not time That makes it Come, for love Is the moment When I give myself And you give yourself Three years later Welcome to âViva a Musica'. We turn our attention today fo António Variagdes. He worked for years as a barber, as he prefers to be called, until he finally recorded his first single, 1 am Beyond". I'll keep on searching For the one I'll give myself fo Because until now I've only Wanted who Who I've never seen Because I only want who Who I've never met António was then ready to record his first LP, âGuardian Angel, with Pop Rock influences, as well as Folk and Amalia Rodrigues, who he dedicated a song fo. His obsession with Portugal's most famous voice reached its climax when Antdnio played the first part of the first concert AmÃ©lia gave after the 25th April revolution. Of course I'm a bit nervous, it's a big responsibility. Amalia is one of the great inspirations in my life, her and my Mom, so I feel the weight of responsibility, but I'm really happy to be singing the first part of Amalia's concert. Are you playing many shows this summer? Yes, over 80 shows. I hope they'll go well, I think they will. And congratulations on your show. It's really important to motivate Portuguese music and musicians. António? I'm watching you on TV. You look so handsome, son. Breathe in. Take a deep breath. That's it. Take it easy, António. Easy. Deep breath, but take it easy. There. António, we'll need to run more tests. But until then you need complete rest. I only need another week to finish the record. - No gigs. - I have one tonight. I've already canceled all the others, but there's one I really must play. That one means a lot to me. António, you really need a rest. That's an order. I didn't want to impress you I didn't want to impress you I didn't want to impress you I didn't want to impress you I didn't want to impress you Press Impress Press Impress That's not what the song was supposed to sound like, was it, António? It was supposed to be prettier, quieter... Damn these potholes. How are you doing? We're nearly there. António, are you sure you don't want to go home? No, I don't. - Do you want me to come with you? - No, Carlos. - I'll go alone, I won't be long. - Okay. I'll wake you when we get there. Do you know what people are saying? That you've become a snob. Success sometimes changes people. I think you know me. I don't change. Listen... I have a really important request to make. I'd really like it if you said yes, even if you treat it as a favor. I don't mind. - Is that why you came? - No, I came to see you. But I also needed to ask you this favor in person. I'm here. What's the favor? I'm playing a gig near my hometown, in Minho, and it will be the first time my Mom sees me perform live. I'd really like it if you came. I'l be spending the night there, you could come with me. It would make me so happy for you to see my village, Fernando. Goon... I won't ask you for anything else. Come with me. Distant, uncertain shape Of what I'll never have I can barely hear it And I nearly cry Why do I cry? I don't know I can barely hear And I nearly cry Why do I cry? I don't know I don't know... I don't know... Hi, Jorge. How are you? I didn't expect to see you here. I was about to call you the other day, but then it slipped my mind. - Congratulations on your success. - Thank you. Have you come to thank God? Yes. And you? What are you doing here? I saw you come in and I thought it was strange. - Sorry. - Are you okay? I have a cold that won't go away. It's like someone cursed me. It wasn't you, was it? I'm kidding. Jorge, I wanted to apologize to you. What for? I should've talked to you when I started playing with Kamikaze. I'm sorry. It's okay. Come, let's get a coffee, catch up. Are you paying? So you got a haircut? You could've come to my shop, I'd give you a discount. Mr. TenÃ©rio, I've been looking for you. How can I help? - I wanted to pay next month's rent. - Already? It's not even the 15th. I'l be traveling for a few days and it might slip my mind. That way it's done. If it's no inconvenience, thanks. - Have a nice trip. - Thanks. See you later. Are we ready? Yes. Fernando, you go in the front, I feel like resting for a bit. That way you can keep the kid company, you might get lucky. Go on. - Very funny. - See, Carlinhos? We're nearly there. - Here? - Yes, keep going. This is it. Keep going. Where are you taking us? - It's pretty, isn't it? - It's beautiful. Thank you. You feel really hot. Do you want to go see a doctor? I'm sick of doctors. My mother Is the best friend I have The certainty I can count on Despite that I'm not what she wished for But she always knew How to accept me A mother's reason is to speak Mother, careful with your advice How careful I should be How to protect myself When you miss me, just write The letter I'll get A reason to make me happy Letters, visits, meetings This exchange we're made of This joy in exchanging Fernando, come here! Do you remember that Easter festival I told you about? The boats come down the river, then stop. Then the priest comes out with the saint, then the band comes, and they walk along this path to bless each of the homes. Come! These are the boats. Can you imagine? Spending so long under water only to have one day of glory each year. It's sad, right? I've waited all my life to be able to say this. Tonight, here with you, I give you the great Amalia Rodrigues! Now I can die in peace. âNow I can die in peace...' How stupid! Why did I say that? Fernando's home is beautiful, isn't it? Itis. It's so beautiful. - António. - Yes? Come say goodbye to Carlos. - Thanks, Carlos. See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow. Get some rest! - I'll go get the bags. - No, you won't. Go home and rest, we all need it. - We'll sort it out tomorrow. - Okay. Go home. Who is behind that mirror? Eyes fixed on mine? Someone who came by And left to wander the world Leaving his eyes on mine Someone who came by And left to wander the world Leaving his eyes on mine Who sleeps in my bed? And tries to dream my dreams? Who sleeps in my bed? And tries to dream my dreams? Someone died on this bed And calls me from up high Somewhere in my dreams Someone died on this bed And calls me from up high Somewhere in my dreams Everything I do or don't do Others did it the same way Everything I do or don't do Others did it the same way That's why I'm tired Of feeling that whatever I do I don't do just for myself That's why I'm tired Of feeling that whatever I do I don't do just for myself My love. Qut there you're always distorted Your name, António Only here is it real Why don't you stay, António? Qut there you're always foreign Speaking of me is just an excuse For you to hear me sing Speaking of me is just an excuse For you to hear me sing TOILETS I've always had that flaw I never complained Once the damage is done It's best to forget António Ribeiro died in 1984, on Saint Anthony's day. Fernando Ataide died a year later. Your name, António Only here is it real Variagbes recorded his first album with Valentim de Carvalho in 1982. During his short career, he only released two albums, both reaching top chart positions, and performed for enthusiastic crowds. His songs became a part of the history of Portuguese music, and remain alive in the memory of several generations to this day.
