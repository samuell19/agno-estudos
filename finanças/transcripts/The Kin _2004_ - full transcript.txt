Good afternoon. I'm John Grubaker. Railroad safety officials still don't know what caused the train crash - in which 14 people died and over 30 were injured. The police who have not yet ruled out the possibility of sabotage have been undertaking interviews throughout the day. And are currently interviewing a number of key eye-witnesses. Representatives from the railroad company have expressed their deep shock and sadness of the tragedy. Michael Brooke, the head of rail safety said their thoughts were now with the families and friends of those, who... Worthless crap. Why couldn't she have made something that you could sell? These are horible! Show some respect. - So what? - She was your mother. Yeah, like she was really interested in me. You never contacted her. It's easy for you to say. You were always the favorite. If it's locked, it must be valuable. You broke it! Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, look! Photographs. Look at this photo of you and mother. She looks about 40. Look at the clothes! It's not dad! Me and Anna. 1911 - Spooky. Must be grandmother. No. No, it's definately mother. - How can it be? Well, you know mother. She was a bit crazy. She used to write strange things all the time. It's definitely you in the photo anyway. I'm not in any of these. Sort it. I want to get some more boxes. Well, that's everything worth saving packed. The rest can go up in flames. Anna, are you ok? I've never seen you like this before. Anna? - Just leave me, ok? Can't I be concerned about my own sister? That'd be the first time. Anna, I know this book's important to you, but can't you see what it's doing to you? You look terrible. You're not sleeping properly, you're not eating properly. These people, they're just using you. -You're just jealous! - I'm not jealous. Why would I be jealous? First in my life i'm doing something important. You've always done whatever you want. Look, I know this business, I know these people! Trust me, I know what I'm talking about. - Whatever. Fine. Please yourself. I'm going back to the city. You're not taking the car! Can you hear me?
