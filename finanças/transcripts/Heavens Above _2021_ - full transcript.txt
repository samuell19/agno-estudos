Don't run, you'll get hungry! They said I've got no Air Spikes shoes cause I'm a stinking refugee who has to whore around for Air Spikes shoes. Go and whore around. That wouldn't be the worst that has happened to us. Stojan, don't promise her something you can't deliver, hear me? Daddy, it doesn't matter. How much for the.... Hundred and ten Deutschmarks. - Ljubisa, the psychic. - Quiet, now! I can't promise that. - You don't have to. - Shut up, kid! Let me put you on speaker, Dobrila, so we can hear your story. Let's go to the workshop. My socks keep disappearing. I fired three cleaning lady so far, no use... It's not the cleaning lady. You've got a demon Azazel, he's a specialist in socks. First he steals your socks. Then, he might even steal your soul. Oh, looks just like home. The well was a little more to the left. Stojan, you're a saint. I feel like I'm back there. Like they haven't burnt the whole place to the ground. I have to go to the bathroom. Your father is too good for this world. My father was a Communist I will kill him, so help me Christ Found a job yet, comrade? You clean up good. No one hires refugees. They even beat you up, I see. Open the fucking door! I have to wash the kid! What the hell?! SIN Stojan... Have you finally lost your mind? It's the draught... Take your hat off. What's that... shit on your head? I've seen this in comic books. He's radioactive. Get lost. It came out tonight. Came out? It's not a pimple. - What will people say? - What can they? It'll pass. You could go on TV with that. Shut your trap! You'll see a doctor first thing tomorrow. With no health insurance? Get away, maybe it's a virus. Can you cure that radio... Why would he cure it? It looks good on him. Shut your eyes! Now! We have nothing in common. I never went to church. I'm a Communist. And I never cared for your priests, either. A hat? In the temple of God? The end is near. The end is near! I guess you saint guys all deserve to be here. But, what about me? Holy man! Holy man! Let me kiss your hand! You got me mixed up with someone else. - Are you St. John? - I'm Stojan. I have to go! Saint John! Saint John! Fourteen, fifteen, nine... Seven, six... What have you done now? Saint John! Open up! Move. What do you want? Put that icon down. Have mercy on me! I'm ill. St. John. Heal me, please! - Grannyfucker. - Shame on you! Stojan is the best person I know. Hey, lady! Nada! The woman dropped this. We have to give it back. Give it back?! Are you crazy?! Look what you've done! I'm sorry, Nada. What are you staring at?! Let's go home. For Air Spikes, holy man. Hold still. - It got in my eye. - Shut up! The TV said, this cleans everything. One misery after another! First they burnt down our homes. Now this sickness. Give me a towel, Nada. It's hot. Hot! Does it look paler? It shines like Las Vegas. Maybe you've just removed the dust. My eyes hurt! People are talking... Towel, please! It hurts. Let it hurt. Motherfuckers. They say you're contagious. They're signing a petition to move you out. What?! Get away from here! Sons of whores. Did you ever think that this might be a gift from... A gift? For a Communist idiot? He didn't even let me baptize the child. Unless the Almighty made a mistake. Don't blaspheme, Nada. Stojan is a good man. Look where it got us. But, I have a plan. - Give me the money! - I don't have it. I saw you take it! Don't! Mine! Mine! Daddy, help! I hate you, witch! Just like on fucking TV. Even better. Don't blaspheme, woman. Don't you see it is God's creation? Get in! A definite sign of God's grace. Rejoice! Rejoice! What if God's grace doesn't suit someone? Doom and gloom. Save and protect, save and protect. I saw you on TV, how you handle socks. A demon... Azazel... Yes, I can handle socks. But this is much more complicated. What are we going to do about it? I even tried bleaching the fucker. No use. That won't help, but I have an idea. - SIN. - What? I say... You need to get him to sin. Does he have any vices? My Stojan doesn't even smoke. Really? What about alcohol? No. That's a shame. You can start with small sins. Gluttony. Good, secure sin. Suitable for this part of the world. As well as laziness. Envy. Small, elegant sin. - Laziness, envy... - Gluttony. You can mix. Two smaller sins, combined. That's a cocktail. Three medium sins performed at the same time, act as one BIG sin. Your friend here, is she married? My husband was killed in war, '92. My condolences. Maybe she could give a helping hand? He just needs a little push. What is he saying? - Hello. - The devil! - Today, you charge 3.10. Clear? - Yes. Hey, Stojan... I hear you're looking for a job. Come. Let me see that shit under your hat. Go, Stojan. You need a job. Holy fucking mother of God... Fuck off! Does this make you a saint, or what? Can it do something? Or it just stands? It just stands. Let's use it to sell my fuel. If people buy it from a saint, they'll think it's pure. What do you say? I can't do that, Rajko. Fuck the halo, then. Come here. Romanian yellow fuel. Mix ratio with water, 2:8. No one will hire a sick man. But I got a cure. What are we celebrating? I forgot about the anniversary? Fuck you. I paid 100 Deutschmarks for this treatment. Shut your nose and drink it up. That's the smallest sin. There are much bigger ones. I know. Our neighbor Mladja beats his wife every day. Sladjana from the barrack 5B sells her body for money. And Rajko sells fuel mixed with water. But we are normal people, Nada. Normal? Look at what's become of you! The locals treat us, refugees like Gypsies. And now, the Gypsies treat us like "niggers"! Drink up! Come on! Fuck this! I'm sorry, Nada. I don't know what got into me. Don't apologize. You're working fine. Come on, drink. Come on. There... there... It seems the bastard blinks a little. He doesn't like it. We're on the right track, Stojan. My Nada... Nada... I love you, Nada. There's still plenty of work. - Nada, don't. Please. - Why not? Deutschemarks? The cops! Run! You kept this for Julija. As a wedding gift. - It's a sin. - You bet! See? Take that! Deutschmarks. Good rate. Come and get it. Fucking smuggled fuel! God, forgive me. Son... Deutschmarks? Professor... we're off for a break. - Just go, kids. - Thanks. Got a light, weirdo? You like my art? You pay 10 000 Deutschmarks and become a saint. Nice face. Saintlike. I've got something that's yours. So, why don't you just... Take it back? I don't even know if you're around. If you exist. I was raised to believe that they made you up. Just to keep simple folks in ignorance. If any of my fellow officers from our military base could see me now, they'd say... Stojan has lost his mind in the war. I often fought with Nada for going to the church while I was a Communist. That's not right. But I never stopped her. Just so you know. We lived a good life together. Until now. I'm afraid, she'll leave me. Because of this. And I love her more than anything in the world. Hop in! What do you think you're doing?! Army exercise number 8, like I've been doing for the past 30 years. Are you fucking with me, or what?! Are you?! You're fucking up our plan! - What can I do? - Eat like a pig and get lazy! Is that too much to ask, if you fucking love me?! Stare at bastard's Mercedes and envy him! Look at him. A Benz. Who can afford a car like that? Only... A thief. I hope... I hope you... You get buried in that car. Nada! It works! Nada! Just go ahead and eat. No need for the fork. Use your fingers, tastes better. Come on. That's it. That's it. Fuck you, halo. What?! What do you want?! Get lost! It shines even more now. Like a fucking crown! Come on, my love. Gulp and gobble. - Where's your wedding ring? - Right here, on the table. I don't care about the flowers. Back to table, when you're done. It's your turn, now. Just keep up the good work. I'll get the fucking kids. Back in my village, the priests eat like pigs and they are God's men. Hurry up. Maybe this is not such a big sin after all. He put on some weight. As well as the halo. My poor hens, what a waste of eggs. St. John... touch me! - Heal me! - Money. - Here... - 50 Deutschmarks? Maybe the Almighty... didn't make a mistake, after all? Healed... - Get lost. now. - That's not my Daddy. - Sure he is. - Thank you, St. John. Wow, business is blooming? - I'll fucking get you. - Get lost! Tomorrow, fried zucchini and meatballs. Put your hat on, please. I can't sleep because of that thing. Don't forget the zucchini. Plum dumplings would be nice. Look at this fucker. It is thicker. It shines like a neon sign. Cut the crap! Fuck a duck! I got lice from you! Motherfucking refugees! I'm living in a shithole! What the fuck's wrong with me? What are you doing to me?! Look at you, a shadow of yourself. While Stojan looks healthier than ever. - All that for nothing! - For nothing. Good morning, Mr. Minister. - Fucking bastard... - Don't please! I vouched for you, I'll lose my job. Borka... Can you lend me 200 million? All the money went on food. I'm sorry. You know how expensive those drugs are for my mother. The pension is just 1,300,222,000 dinars. That's all. Yes, life is hard without a man. Please, don't ask that, Nada. It's a sin. Of course it is. The biggest one. The biggest one! Nada, how can I do it? My mother is here. - She doesn't speak. - But she understands everything. No way. Look at her! Granny, shut your eyes. Like you're sleeping. See? What are you waiting for? Take your clothes off! Nada, could you go out? You don't mind granny watching, but you're ashamed of your best friend. I have to be here in case you get carried away. - Carried away? - Things might get out of control. Borka, lie down and spread your legs. Don't just stand there. Hop on the neighbor. Move. Borka, are you comfortable? Just do it, don't you worry about me. Nada, get out. I'm gonna smack you, fuck a duck! Okay. I'm sorry, Borka. No problem. Just do your thing. It's not working. Maybe it needs time. What are you doing to me, Stojan? I'm not made of stone. One lousy fuck. All I asked. Is that so hard to do? I gave you food, booze, even my best friend. The Almighty sees everything! Face it, you're not trying hard enough, you lame piece of shit! What? You can't even hit like a man, you wimp! Not good enough! Harder! Harder! That's not good enough! Strike harder! Hit me. Maybe that will help. He'll be just fine. He'll be your good, old Daddy once he gets well. You're gonna burn so easy in hell full of booze, you drunken bastard! Okay... Motherfucker! 21-21-23... Where is the fucking "boom"?! God, fuck a duck! You won't fuck with me anymore. No, you won't. Take this, halo! And this! You're still hanging on to it?! Still hanging on to it?! Let's see now who's gonna win. We'll see who's stronger! Borka! Open up! Stojan? Hit the road, granny! Stojan, oh my! Oh my God! We need a flashlight here. Try now to show off with your Mercedes. That's it. Borka! See? I'm trying harder now. Ask Borka. I can't believe what those assholes did last night! They put sugar in my fuel tank. Anyway... Maybe you saw something last night? Don't worry, Rajko. I'll watch your car. - That's nice of you. - I serve and protect. - Fucking whore, messing with my man! - Nada! There was nothing I could do about it! He just barged in my room! Family business to attend. - Stop messing with my man! - Fuck off! You can't mess with me! Stojan, we already tried that! Now I put my heart into it. Go inside and take your clothes off! Forgive me, God. Forgive me for resenting your grace. Please, give him back to me. Sleep, honey. Where's your boss? - What's that? - Light show. I've got firecrackers, too. Fuck a duck! Come, come. Daddy... I found someone. - Someone? - My friend's dad is a doctor. He wants to see you. To help you. Mom says it's okay. - Isn't that great? - Great. You think Daddy needs a doctor? You think Daddy's sick? No. Daddy is healthy. Daddy is going to help you. Daddy found a real job for you. Plus... This is yours. And Gods. Try them on. - Real Air Spikes. - Try them on. Put on something nice. Daddy's gonna take you somewhere. Julija... do as you're told. This lady sure can dance, right? Hurry up, scum. You'll start with waiting tables, to get some experience. Just watch and learn. You'll do fine. I learned to walk by the pole. Go to the backroom and meet the other artists. - The kid is a killer. - Just like her dad. Have you seen a young girl? This big? We prepared her for dance, but she ran away. Look... - Communist army march - Company, at ease! Stojan, where's our child? We've got two kids, now. Lena and Borislava. Artists. Where is my child?! You'll sleep here, with a saint. Any more sins on the list? Or we checked them all? So we can sit and relax. His dick was, like, really tiny! You gave him a discount? - Wait for me here! - Okay. - Church is not for hookers. - Okay. Gotcha! Hey, artist! Get lost! I gotta talk with someone. What's wrong, Father? The city arranged for some guy to set up a car wash nearby, and ignored my close friend. Fucking Communists. I'll take care of it. Thank you, Your Holiness. It's a bit hot in here. Turn on the AC, Father. You're doing fine on this painting. Look so alive. I'll tell the Professor to speed you up a little. I'll wait until he's done, then he's going to paint me. Fucking mute! Get lost! This is not a nut house! Keep away from God's temple! Well, my colleague... What to tell you, bro? Thank you. I hit some bumps along the way... Maybe I didn't appreciate you right from the start. But, let me tell you something. I don't know if you could've found a better person... for this. - Maniac! - Let me go! I'll pay! De... mo... cra... cy... light. De-mo-cra-cy-light. Gojko goes to church. Lights a candle. Gojko tells you... learns... letters. How you hear Gojko? Through wall? GRACE Gianni, Daddy needs this for work. Go, drive your car. Yes? Yes, Minister. I'm just clearing the goods. They didn't know it was for you. I'm sorry, he's retarded. He works here for food and shelter. Gojko, go in the back. Move it! Move it! Don't worry, a harmless creature. There you go. Yes? Gianni, let's go! Mister... what is that for? For my line with the Holy Mother! Hang on. Get lost! Now! Gross... Gianni, come on! Holy Mother! Holy Mother... Holy Mother... Gojko has this, now. How... this... work... Gojko... talk... Holy Mother... For double murder in a cruel and vicious manner, the Court sentences you to death. I can't talk now. Later. Sorry. Defendant, do you understand the verdict? Mister... Can I see... your phone? Put that phone away, for Heaven's sake. Madam... you not selfish? Shut up, will you? Take him away. Holy Mother. I forgot your song. Holy Mother! Holy Mother, put it back in Gojko's head! Stop it! Stop it! Sing now, fucking moron! Come on, let's go. Move, you animal! Sing! Inmate Gojko Papic, Mr. Warden. For days now, he wants to talk to the Holy Mother. We don't know if he's just fucking with us, or he's a bit... The appeal, filed by a lawyer, appointed by the state, has been denied. The execution is set for tomorrow at 8.00 a.m. in the institution's yard. Tell the priest to come and see the inmate. It would be a shame for the priest to waste time on this animal. It would be a shame if the priest lost a good gig. Yes, sir! You... Any last wishes? Phone. You can sing this until your last breath. Which is tomorrow. Holy fucking mother of God! The battery's dead... Go ahead and curse, Father. You're among friends, here. - Is that him, singing? - If you can call this singing. I know that man. Feeble minded, but devoted to God. Good for him, Father. Work well, priest. If he bites you, hit the panic button. Father... Tasa.... Gojko, Gojko... The name of that bandit, that big sinner, on the cross to the right of Jesus, was Dismas. He repented of his sins. You will do the same, Gojko. Do what, Father? Repent for your crimes. For taking something that doesn't belong to me? But I asked him nicely. I said, 'Please'. 'I just want to see your phone.' But he... selfish! And that's a sin... too. You teach Gojko. But they beat Gojko. Woman... scratch Gojko... Man... hit Gojko on head. Gojko good man. Gojko cries. Yes, Gojko cries. But the little boy cries, too. You made him an orphan. Remember the boy? Boy good. Doesn't hit Gojko. Dog good, too. Wag tail. Loves Gojko. Gojko... fooling around with Father? There you go, Gojko. Enjoy your last meal. That's a tradition, Father. You guys are big on tradition, right? The accountant is going home. Hurry, or you won't get paid. I'll be right there. Priest... Eat, my son. Just eat. ...even St. Paul was a sinner and a violent man. But he wanted to be good. He wanted to be good. Like you are, my son. To be loved by everyone. And no one to beat him. - And he ascended... - Father Tasa... I'm sleepy. We need to finish this, son. He ascended so high, that he became like an angel. He became holy. Holy Mother. That's nice, son. She calls Gojko. On the phone. Father... got a phone? Or you selfish, too? Father is not selfish. I've got a phone. But it's dead. There you go, Gojko. There's a battery inside, it gives power. But it's empty. Holy Mother! Is it her? MALE voice. To Your infinite grace I give my body and my soul. Your mercy is light, it takes away the sins of the world. Too late for praying, priest. The accountant went home. Come in, Father. I've been waiting for you. First, I opened this door for the reporters. Then, for the potential buyers. The family had a fight over inheritance. A Biblical story. - You want to buy the apartment? - No. I baptized their child. Just fooling with you, priest. When something like this happens to bad people, to those who robbed and harmed many people. Does that make you think this is God's justice? Horrific crime. God's mercy is undeniable. Of course. He spared the child. Isn't that grace? Mighty good job, baptizing that kid, priest. Lord, I lift my hands to You. In Your justice, rescue me. Deliver my soul. Deliver the soul of a sinner. Lord, answer my prayer. Answer my prayer. The firing squad is ready, Mr. Warden! Good. I don't hear a song, now. He doesn't feel like singing. Good morning, Gojko! Rise and shine! Too late for tears, Gojko. Get up! Come on, Gojko! A freaking baby? You let the prisoner escape, morons?! I've been here, minutes ago. His size was normal! I swear to God! You are the Advocate, the Victory and the Savior for all who believe in You... We praise You. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost... Amen, priest. You earned your money, you've done your job too well, it seems. Now it's time for the government to do its job. You wouldn't go against our Lord? This is a sign! Fuck yeah. The sign. It's right here! Low forehead. Small, evil eyes. All the criminal features. This is the right inmate, no doubt about it. Just go ahead, laugh. You'll cry, soon enough. Grab this. Do a DNA test and fingerprints. DNA requires a written consent of my client! Let him sign it. You're tempting me? Good. But, my miracle is here to stay. I serve and protect. Let's draw a bit, baby. Let's play with ink a bit. Stop bullshitting me, Gojko. I know it's you. Gojko hit big officer? Lord, give me a sign. Your miracles transcend the power of mortals. Give me a sign. Gojko! Watch the birdie! We don't need a fucking mugshot! Give me a sign... give me a sign.... I'll get you for this, little brat. DNA and fingerprints, 100% match. The criminal shrank under the weight of guilty conscious. The law is clear. I suggest we commence the execution. Hand me my client, please. Client? Do I really have to prove the innocence of a newborn baby? Gojko did kill, but he is a pure soul. The Lord granted him a second chance. Doesn't anyone here see the finger of God? My finger of God is stronger than your finger, priest. - Is there a problem? - No! Prepare the inmate for the execution. To change his diapers? He pooped. - Russia attacks! - Finally! There is God! The other Tower goes down! Way to go, Orthodox brothers! Fucking priest. Let him go. Lord, answer my call. Or at least text me. Text me, at least. GIANNI MARKOVIC 1993-2001 For our God is a consuming fire. Hebrews, 12:29. The New Testament was written by children. Children of God. The Old Testament is by... You're alive! You came for the funeral service? Someone from this building ratted on us? Alive. Too late for your help, priest. I buried him without a fucking funeral service. - Fuck the church! - Don't. What do you want? May I use your phone? No problem. But take your shoes off. The slippers are right here. Lift that up, fuck a duck! Asshole, do I have to lift the inmate? Forgive me... forgive me! I... I can't do this. Where are you going? I'm not needed here anymore. I have an important meeting. Have a nice day. We can' help you anymore. Motherfuckers... Don't just stand there! You got your orders. I'm surrounded by a bunch of retards. The target is a bit too far, Mr. Warden. Okay. I can see that the target is tiny. Come closer. Assume the firing position! Ready! THE GOLDEN CALF Fuck! Fuck you! I'd like to paint you. What? On that scale you just broke to pieces. I had an appointment. Did you paint this? No. I have this when I was a kid. Did you bring the portfolio? Why portfolio? Come! You stole a cart from the supermarket? They've got tons of them. All exactly the same. Wait, I'll get dressed. I was madly in love with her. I was six, she was eight. The love of my life. Later, a family adopted her. I stayed in the orphanage. No one liked me enough. I could paint your gallery. I do that, too. Stop it. Okay. I'll take these two. What about the down payment? - You know what? - What? I do only commission sale. Even with great artists. Well established. Wait a minute, fool! Hey, fool! Hey! Take this. Is this enough? That's a week of wall painting. Just wait till Microbe hears about this! - You know Microbe? - No. My Professor. He hates me! What a jerk. Mine! I found it first. Hey, mister... Mister... You can't sleep here. There you go. No, I don't need money. I'll be on my way, as soon as I have my breakfast. Hello! You do not need transport to Germany! Stinky will transport you to Eat! Real good! Belly full! What a wonderful feeling! Stinky will never be hungry again! Sausage! You don t need it! Stinky will give you Real Food! Wait in line! It's urgent! Nada... Ten Euros. No money. Bad sex, no love. Filthy dog! (Arabic) Eat donkey's dick! (Arabic) Let the poor man go. He'll pay. He's hungry, just like us. That's why you're a bum. You can't be a proper whore. I'll take you with me, you'll eat. - Let me help you. - Get off, bum! Okay. Posh shoes, for you. Children's size, bum. - You expect me to watch old junk? - Nada... - Stinky, you really lost it. - Wait and see. Listen. - Get away from me! - Okay. Give me your hand. If only I knew that it was so simple, I would've gone to an exhibition every day! But that was not part of police training. Come here. Look at this one. Just like you and me. Yeah, you wish. Come on, now. Are you fucking with me, bum? Just look at it and you'll feel it. Feel what? Like you're eating. Just chew into it. Poor sucker, hunger drove him crazy. Let's go back to dumpsters. Nada, that one there is a Good Painting! This one will work. It's got sheep. This is art?! Cheaters! This is not a Good Painting! This is not a Good Painting! This is not a Good Painting! Just relax. Let's go dumpster diving. How's wall painting business, Gojko? I came to repay my debt, Professor. You're lending my money to this mediocrity? The worst Fine Arts Academy student ever! I choose who gets my money! I choose who gets my pussy! You were getting my money while he was getting my pussy! Is there a problem with that, Professor?! Yes, there is! Gojko, let's have a word outside. Let me go, cunt! No. Until you say who is a better painter. I am! Far better than you! I make my living from my art! I'm a top teacher, not a wall painter, like you! You get paid for painting rich people! What about Da Vinci? What about Raffaello? What about Goya? I sold a painting. To the B2 Gallery. You sold a painting? Your schizophrenia kicked in again? I'm on medication. That's good to hear. First we check it out, then we celebrate! You'll pay the drinks. But only if it's true! I'm not saying you're a liar, just a mental patient. Go back to work! Wrap that up. Mr. Markovic. I'm so glad to see you. I've got a young artist, just for you. Too tiny. Need bigger stuff, for the lobby. Decorative? I've got something suitable. That one is too dark. This one is too purple. I've seen your father. He's proud of you. My assistant will show you decorative stuff. - Defiant, just like your father. - Sasha! Show this gentleman happy-go-lucky art. - Don't push! - I got it! Let's go, Mr. M. Call the police. Why didn't you strike at the tycoon?! You had to raid my gallery instead?! Hello? Police? What do you want?! What?! Get lost! Shoo! Shoo! Scram! Missus! I missed the dessert! So, only this one here is Good Art. Not all of them are. Yes, yes... That's not right. Art should belong to the People. You're crying? Is it because you didn't get enough food? There's something hypnotic about them. Nada, come on in. Let's eat. Julija! Nada... Julija... Sasha, get my bag. Get lost, now. I haven't got a trace of compassion. Neither for you, nor for him. Is that a sin?! You're an expert on sin. Tell me! Tell me! Tell me! Nada, come on, taste this. You have to eat. Lady, you just don't know what kind of a miracle you've got here. Listen... If you don't tell anyone about this, I'll let you look at the paintings again. Sasha, see off the guests. Come on, let's go. Please... come on. Come here. This can't be true. It was here. I thought... I was dreaming. Then, I came by to check, three times. She discovered Gojko, not Goya! Where is it?! Mental disorder... My painting! You could check in to rehab. Let's go, he'll get himself arrested. Moron! He cut his hands! I'm so stupid. That's him. The genius! Let's go and meet him. I'm so... I'm so stupid. Stupid. We don't have to tell him anything. We just keep our mouths shut and eat. But our folks don't live here. I could wait for you. I know this neighborhood. I used to live here before I became "our folks". Is this why you came here? I didn't mean to do it. What, exactly? Here's your money back. Let me look at the paintings. These are new? Both old and new. This is not about... the window? I like your paintings. They are good. - Got any glasses? - I've got... one. Ten year contract. Congratulations. You got yourself a gallerist. Thousand Euros for each painting. Genius! What are you doing here?! Shoo! Get lost! You were talking to me? Come on, get inside. Fool. Get in, get in. Maestro... - Don't... - Could we, just a little...? Of course. Can we just take a look? - Of course. - Nada, come on! My dream was that simple folk would understand my art. This one's even better than the last one. It tastes better. - It's juicy. - Sure, it has fruit. Wow, lamb chops. See? Lunatics. That's fine. I've got a diagnosis, too. But... they act strange, It's called All Humans and Painters in the 22nd Century, Under One Tree. What exactly you like about it? The colors? The technique? Nutritional value. They speak metaphorically? So, that's why I haven't eaten... Since last autumn. Get lost! Scram! Beat it! - But, genius... - Get lost! - Maestro... - I'll show you maestro! Scram! Mom... You'll never be hungry again. I thought... I'm a Man of God. That not eating was a sign... from Him. Maybe it was. You have a gallerist now. Your gift is... Gift?! To be a butcher? To be a baker? That's not a gift. That's... God's punishment. Take the biggest one. Probably the most nutritious. What about our contract? Just go. Go. You all heard about the expression "soul food". Pick one painting.... And watch carefully. The biggest one... for me. Just one question, please! I am from Qatar. Speak English, little. Fucking Arabs. Mister! The media went crazy about three paintings, which already got a name, "Nutritious Art." Suddenly, common people got interested in art. Miracle of God, the media say. What do you want from me? I just wished that people would see my work. Is that a sin? Everyone is after Gojko now. Gojko... Waits. For a sign. Son... we're closing in five minutes. You hear Gojko... through the wall. The UNESCO bought the Yellow Doggy, to feed the hungry children in war zones. Look how happy they are! Slow down, mister! - Too fast! - Fast food! You disappeared. - I couldn't find you. - Some people are after me. They are after me, too. Get in. Hey, your place is all white. Like a psychiatric ward. This is for the Yellow Doggy and the Suicide Bridge. Self Portrait With the Bridge and a River. That's the title. Would you like to keep this for me? Too many calories for me. Besides gluttony, they bring out greed. Come. Do you have a warrant, assholes? Julija... Running away, again? Come. Hug your father. The Parliament just passed the law on expropriation of the artist and his work. Possession of any work of his art is a crime against the state. The offender is facing life imprisonment. You're in luck. Daddy's always there for you. Because Daddy... believes that family is sacred. You have to go. They will be watching my apartment. Do you have a trusted friend? No. But I've got a trusted enemy. Who needs so many pairs of shoes? You're like a caterpillar. I'd like to paint you like one, someday. Just go. Please. Your nose is bleeding, you know that? I know. I'll be going now. Massive protests continue as the state sold the "Suicide Bridge" to businessman Petar Markovic. Who plans to sail around the world and feed solely on art. All my life, I paint serious things and nobody gives a fuck about me! Just look at him! Newsflash every hour! Don't just sit there! Answer the door to your sluts. They always take my wine, but never give any pussy. A fucking reality show! Reality show! Some masked people are after me. I believe it's the cops. For years, I've been saying that your paintings are scribbles with no soul. But this is... Exquisite. You've made great progress. Great. What do we do now? You kicked me out of the Academy for a good reason. I'm no artist at all. But you are. - Are you fucking with me? - No. You should be famous, not me. With this... food factory. Can I borrow some of your turpentine? Turpentine? What do you want to do with turpentine? To set a fire. Once they burn, no one will ever mock my work again. Or eat from it. He'll make us his accomplices. Don't worry, I won't do it in here. I'm not that crazy. - Call someone. - You do it. - Why me? - Because! - Cunt. - I'll do it here! No one will ever laugh at Gojko anymore! No one will ever laugh at Gojko anymore! - There he is! - I'm a loyal citizen! No! Open the door and surrender! The terrorist blocked the door with a barricade! That's a work of art, police cunt! That's mine! Mine! You're surrounded! Shoot, cunts! Shoot! Move away from government property! That's my property! Mine. No one will ever force Gojko to paint again! Get down! You are the property of the State! Gojko is a schizophrenic. But you're way out of my league. - Did you paint this? - Yes. You like them? Nah. But I haven't eaten all day, now I'm full. Why do I have to die surrounded by idiots? Leave that asshole, this one has Good Paintings, too. Drop it. Fuck you and your paintings! Let's go. Less than six months later, hundreds of painters entered the nutritious phase. Besides feeding the citizens, art built up immunity in the population, by killing bacteria and deadly viruses. The scientists couldn't solve the nutritious art enigma, but common folk couldn't care less, because now everyone could eat lamb chops... at least painted ones. That was the beginning of the Golden Age. - Hey! - Hey? Let's celebrate your return to art! No need for alcohol. Wait. Let me fill the glasses. No need for that. Come here! Just look... carefully. I feel... High. There's no food here at all. Just... It's better to get you high, than to fill your belly. Right? Definitely. It's not that strong, yet. Hey... come over here, I want to tell you something. I see you, happy, satisfied, and even chubby, forgive me my bold humor. Those dark times, not so long ago, seem like a bad dream. Our creative industry has brought us Golden Age. We live today... I'm sorry... live today. It seems to us, as if those unfortunate decades... Never happened at all... Aim! - And... - Stop! - Stop! - We're working here, priest! The Lord has erased the crime! There's no crime! The Markovic couple is alive! I'm begging you! Please, check! I'm begging you! Move away priest, for God's sake! - Take him away. - See for yourself, I'm begging you! - Let's go. - Don't go against God! - Come on. - Don't! Let's wrap this up. Aim! And... Lord, I stretch my hands to You. Show me the way I should go, for to You I lift up my soul. For your name's sake, Lord, preserve my life, in your righteousness bring my soul out of trouble. Bring out of trouble this sinner's soul, o Lord. Answer my prayer. Answer my prayer, Lord.
