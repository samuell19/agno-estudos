[â™ª] [SPEAKING JAPANESE] [ALL CHATTERING] Tutti-frutti. Most generous gift from American sergeant. Lovely ladies, kind gentlemen, pleased to introduce myself. Sakini by name, interpreter by profession. Education by the ancient dictionary. Okinawan by, uh, whim of gods. History of Okinawa reveal distinguished record of conquerors. We have honor to be subjugated in, uh, 14th century by Chinese pirate. In 16th century, by English missionary. In 18th century, by Japanese warlords. And in 20th century, by American Marine. Okinawa very fortunate. Culture brought to us. Not have to leave home for it. And we learn many thing. Most important, that rest of world not like Okinawa. World filled with delightful variation. Example: uh, in Okinawa, no-- No locks on doors. Bad manners not to trust neighbors. In America, lock and key big industry. Conclusion: bad manners, good business. Another example: in Okinawa, wash self in public bath with nude lady quite proper, but a picture of nude lady in, uh, private home quite improper. In America, statue of nude lady in park win prize, but nude lady in flesh in park win a penalty. Conclusion: pornography, question of geography. But, uh, Okinawa most eager to be educated by conquerors. Not easy to learn. Sometimes very painful. But pain make man think. Thought make man wise. And wisdom make life endurable. So now-- Now we going to tell you little story to demonstrate splendid example of benevolent assimilation of democracy by Okinawa. Boss by name of Colonel Purdy III. Number three after name indicate he is son of a son of a son. Colonel Purdy put up many sign. This exceedingly civilized. Make it very easy for uncivilized to know what not to do. Here laundry of officer not to fraternize with laundry of enlisted man. Dozo. This gentleman honorable Sergeant Gregovich, assistant to Colonel Purdy, but not a son of son of son. You know what he's doing? Explanation: Colonel Purdy great student of history. So every month, wife of Colonel Purdy send him magazine called Adventure Magazine. Cover have picture of pirate with a black patch over eye. Everyone try to steal magazine. So colonel hide under desk so he can read first, but the sergeant always find. [BOTH CHUCKLE] He's a smart mouse. This gentleman, exalted boss, Colonel Purdy III. Colonel very wise man. Every morning look up at the sky and make a prophecy. It's not gonna rain today. And you know what? Not-- Not rain. Of course it not rain this time of year in whole history of Okinawa, but the colonel not make mistake. Un, deux, trois... Explanation: Army teach colonel French for invasion of Europe, then send to Okinawa instead. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Where's my eighth pair of shorts? Now colonel gonna yell loud for Sakini. So I hide. I pretend to be asleep here. So... PURDY: Sakini. Sakini? Sakini? [SNORING] Sakini! Sakini! Sakini. Oh, good morning, boss. You sure surprised me, boss. I want you to tell me why my laundry comes back every week with one piece missing. Oh, gets lost, boss. I know it gets lost. What I wanna find out is how it gets lost. Oh, very simple, boss. Family take laundry to wash in the stream and while friends exchange greetings, laundry exchange places. We run down hill fast as dickens to catch laundry, boss. Well? Not run fast enough. No wonder you people were subjugated by the Japanese. If you're not sleeping, you're running away from work. Where's your get-up-and-go? Ooh, guess get-up-and-go went, boss. Well, get up and go down to the officers' quarters and see if Captain Fisby's arrived. If he has, tell him to report to me at once. Hurry. Sakini. Yes, boss? You are a civilian employee in the pay of the United States Army and should dress accordingly. Yeah. Pull your socks up. Very sorry, boss. Very sorry. Socks up. Anything more, boss? That'll be all. Is that as fast as you can walk? No, no, boss, but to walk any faster, socks fall down. Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq, six ... Good morning, sir. At ease. I'm gonna get rid of that interpreter. He doesn't set a good example. Uh, colonel, sir, we gotta have someone around who speaks the language. [CHUCKLES] You're quite right, sergeant, quite right. It isn't often I make a mistake. But when I do-- It's a beaut? I wasn't going to say that. I was gonna say, "By George, I admit it." I'm sorry, sir. Now, we've got a new officer reporting this morning. He's been transferred to us from Psychological Warfare. I don't suppose you happen to know who they are. Aren't they something at the rear of the rear echelon? They're just the cream of the Army's geniuses. They're just the brains behind the fighting heart. Every man Jack of them has a mind like a steel trap. And we're lucky to be getting one of their officers. I'll watch my step, sir. Eh, while we're waiting for Captain Fisby I'd like you to make a note of new signs I want painted. The painter hasn't finished the ones you ordered yesterday, sir. There's only one answer to that: put on another sign painter. Yes, sir. Now, I noticed the men were dancing with each other in the canteen the other night. Yes, sir. "No dancing allowed." I didn't say that, Gregovich. I don't object to the men dancing. I want them to enjoy themselves. But it doesn't set a good example for the natives to see noncoms dancing with enlisted men. So have a sign posted saying: "Sergeants are forbidden to dance with privates." [CLEARS THROAT] You might as well take that memo to the sign painter right now. Yes, sir. [CLEARS THROAT] Sakini here, boss. Don't ever put your finger on an officer. Oh, oh, not right, boss? No! Oh. If you wanna announce your presence, knock. Ah-so. Can't you natives ever learn anything about custom? Ah-so. What do you think you're doing? Oh, not know, boss. Do what you ask. Everything in this country conspires to annoy me. Well, where is Captain Fisby? Oh, oh, he come now, boss. I run ahead. Uh, socks fall down. Captain Fisby reporting, sir. Welcome to Team 147. Ha-ha! I can't tell you how glad I am to have you. Thank you, sir. Frankly, we're so desperate for officer personnel I'd be glad to see you even if you had two heads. [GIGGLES] That'll be all, Sakini. You can wait outside. Okay. Sit down, captain, sit down. Thank you. Ha-ha-ha! Thank you very much. Oh, oh, oh, sorry, boss. I sit by door, boss. May as well be comfortable here. Yes. Not sleep. Uh, have you unpacked? Oh, yes, sir, yes, sir. I unpacked as soon as I got in last night. Well, that's too bad because you'll have to pack again. Oh? I am sending you to Tobiki at once. We need a man of your caliber up there right away. Well, thank you. I am informed that you requested this transfer from Psychological Warfare to my outfit. May I say that I am honored. Yeah. Well, in all fairness, sir, I think I should tell you that I was requested to request it. Oh? Mm. May I ask why? Uh-huh. Well, it-- Eh, you see, sir, it seems that my-- My propaganda to undermine the enemy's morale undermined the staff's morale instead. How did you get into Psychological Warfare in the first place? I was requested to request a transfer. From what? The Paymaster General's office. What was your duty there? Well, I-- I had charge of the payroll-computation machine. Well, until-- Until what? Well-- [SIGHS] You know, machines have always been my mortal enemy, colonel. I don't believe that they're inanimate. They're not inanimate at all. They're full of malice and ill will. I asked you what happened, captain. Yes. Yes, sir. Uh, well, this machine-- This-- You know, the payroll-computation machine. --it made a mistake, it seems, of a quarter of a million dollars in the payroll. And, uh, unfortunately, the men were paid before the mistake was discovered. What did they do to you? Oh, they gave me a job licking envelopes. And then you asked for a transfer. No. I developed an allergy to glue. How many outfits in this man's Army have you been in, captain? Let's see, how many are there now, sir? Uh-- Never mind. I admit disappointment, but not defeat. I thought you were given to me in recognition of my work here. Frankly, I expect to be made a general soon. And I want that star for my wife's crown. Naturally, that's very hush-hush. Oh, yes, naturally. Do you know something, sir? Do you know something? I-- I just think that perhaps I just wasn't cut out to be a soldier, that's all. Captain, none of us was cut out to be a soldier, but we do the job. We adjust, we adapt, we roll with a punch and bring victory home in our teeth. Do you know what I was before the war? A football coach? I was the Purdy Paper Box Company of Pottawatomie. What did I know about foreigners? But my job is to teach these natives the meaning of democracy. And they're gonna learn democracy if I have to shoot every one of them. Yes, sir. What did you do before the war? Oh, I was a-- An associate professor at Muncie. What'd you teach? The humanities. Captain, you're finally getting a job you're qualified by training to handle: teaching these natives how to act human. No, I don't think the humanities are quite that. If you can teach one thing, you can teach another. This is plan B. Washington has drawn up full instructions pertaining to the welfare and recovery of these native villages. Consider it your Bible, captain. Yes, sir. I'll study it very carefully. Now, there might be some questions I'd like to ask. Washington has anticipated all of your questions. Yes, but I was thinking-- You don't even have to think. This document relieves you of that responsibility. Uh, how is your Japanese? Oh, not so very good. No, no. Not-- Not good, sir. Oh, I can see you'll need an interpreter. Well, I-- No, no-- Uh, sir-- I've got just the man for you. Colonel? Colonel? Sakini! I could study the language, you know. No need, we won the war. Sakini present, boss. Socks up, not sleeping. Sakini, this is Captain Fisby. We meet before, boss, you forget. Yeah, we met. I'm assigning you to Captain Fisby. He's gonna take charge of a village at the top of Okinawa. A village called Tobiki. Tobiki, boss. Very nice place, boss, but not at top of Okinawa, at bottom. Don't tell me where the villages under my command are located. I happen to give a course in map reading. Very sorry, boss. But happen to be born in Tobiki. It's at the bottom. Then it's time you learned where you were born. Oh, very sorry, boss, but map upside down. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Why doesn't the Army learn how to draw a map properly? That'll be all, Sakini. Find Sergeant Gregovich and have him assign a jeep to Captain Fisby! Then load supplies and the captain's gear. You'll be leaving at once. I mention you in prayer to gods, boss. I wait for you in jeep, captain. I sometimes think we occupation teams have it tougher than combat troops. Oh, now, I wouldn't say that, sir. Granted, they had it rough for a while. But we have the killing daily grind with no glory in it. Yes, sir, I know what you mean, sir. Life itself is a battlefield with its own obscure heroes. I consider that poetry, captain. Oh, no, no, that's-- That's prose, colonel. And it isn't mine, you know. It's, uh, Victor Hugo. Oh, yes, Victor Hugo. How I loved Tale of Two Cites. [CHUCKLES] Isn't that, um, Dickens? Isn't that Dickens, sir? Well, to get back to Tobiki. Your first job will be to establish a municipal government and to build a school. Yes, sir. Uh, plan B calls for the schoolhouse to be pentagon-shaped. Penta--? When the schoolhouse is built, organize a Ladies' League for Democratic Action. Uh-huh. Captain, this is a chance for you to make a name for yourself. Yes, sir, I-- I feel that I personally have delayed victory at least a year, and I wanna vindicate myself. That's the kind of talk I like to hear. Thank you. Well, I won't detain you then. Yes, sir. My only order to you is put that village on the map. Y-- Yes, sir. Send me a bimonthly progress report in triplicate. Yes, sir. Don't duplicate your work. No, sir. No, sir. And remember that the eyes of Washington are on our occupation teams, and the eyes of the world are on Washington. Yes, sir. I'll keep the eyes in mind, sir. Goodbye, captain. Yes, sir. Goodbye, sir. [SIGHS] Oh, everything all set, boss? We go Tobiki now? Now, listen, I gotta get my gear packed first, Sakini. Oh, all finished, boss. I have many cousin work for Army. Where's our jeep? Right over there, boss. Huh? Ohayo gozaimasu. Ohayo gozaimasu. What's she doing up there? Oh, she nice old lady, boss. She hear we go to Tobiki village, so she think she go along to visit grandson. Oh, she does? Uh-huh. Well-- Well, you tell her I'm very sorry, but you see, this-- This is against regulations. Oh, she not fall off, boss. She tied on good. Yes. Well, you untie her, Sakini. You get up there and untie her and tell her to get down. You see, she's going to have to find some other way to visit her grandson. Oh, boss, her grandson mayor of Tobiki village. You gonna make him lose face, you kick old grandma off jeep. Oh. You say she's the mayor's grandmother? Yes. Mm-hm. Well, all right. You see-- She's tied on all right, I guess, huh? So I guess we can take her. Sure. Now, look, is all this stuff here mine? No, most of the stuff belong to old lady. Eh, she, uh, gonna stay three or four months, so she bring her cooking pots and bed and, uh, a present for friend and-- Uh-huh. Well, I don't-- I don't-- Uh, all right. Look, if you see any low branches coming, you just, uh-- You know, you yell out. And, uh, get in there, Sakini. You get in there, and give me directions while I drive. You wanna get in? No, no, can't go yet. Old lady daughter not here, boss. Wait-- Wait a minute, maybe I didn't hear you right. You say-- You don't mean the daughter is coming with us. Well, old lady very old, boss. Who gonna take care of her on the trip? Oh, here she come now, boss. Right on dot. Uh, I don't-- Listen-- [SPEAKING JAPANESE] Will you just wait a minute. Now, wait a minute, will you mind? Tell her-- Um, Miss-- Uh, Sakini, will you tell her that there's no room for anything more on this jeep. Old lady must take clothes to show friends, boss, because you make her lose face if, uh, people think she only got one dress. Miss, will you please come back? Sakini, ask her to come back. There's no room for any more bundles on this jeep. No, she not go get bundles, boss, she go get children. Sakini. Sakini. What? Look, these things are always happening to me. And I-I've gotta put a stop to them someplace. Daughter not go without children, and old lady not go without daughter. And if old lady not go, mayor of Tobiki be mad with you, boss.

No. No. No. Yes, I like-- I mean, I don't know-- It's not a question of whether I like the goat. It's-- I'm just sure that the colonel, he wouldn't like it.

Wait. Please wait. What? Now, who in the blazes is he? Who in the blazes is he, boss? Never see before. Ask him what he's doing sitting here, please. [CONVERSING IN JAPANESE] Oh.

No, very rude. Make people feel poor, boss. I don't want to do that. Get up here, Sakini. Tell them I'll accept gifts, but in the name of the United States occupation forces.

All moons good, but August moon little older, little wiser. Sakini said that you made this cup all by yourself. Oh, yes. You know that this is a lost art, Sakini. This is an industry we could start right here, right now in Tobiki. Think you could mass-produce these? "Mass-produce"? Yes, you know, set up machines, turn them out by the gross. I take pride in making one cup at a time, captain. How many of these do you think you can turn out in, oh, say, one day? If I work hard, maybe one or two a week. Fine, that's good, you make as many as you can. We'll send them up to the American Post Exchange, and we'll sell them as fast as you can turn them out. I shall do my best. Fine! We're in business.

They got no more presents for you anyhow. Oh, all right. It's important that I tell them about the schoolhouse that we're gonna build for their children. Now, according to plan B, I believe it says the direct approach is the most effective. So you ready? Oh, all set, boss. Do you want to be ignorant? [SPEAKS IN JAPANESE] [CROWD SHOUTS] What? What was that? They say yes, boss. Yes? You mean they want to be ignorant? Oh, no, boss. Oh, in Japanese, boss, yes mean no. They say, "Yes, we not want to be ignorant." Oh, I see.

[SPEAKS IN JAPANESE] [SPEAKS IN JAPANESE] They say, "What is democracy?", boss. They know what rice is. Yes, all right. Democracy is a system of self-determination. It's the right to make the wrong choice. [SPEAKS IN JAPANESE] [CROWD MUTTERING] Wait a minute, we're not getting through to them. Let me explain it this way: suppose I'm back home and I don't like the way that Uncle Sam is treating me. Well, you know what I can do? I can write to the president himself and I can tell him so. [SPEAKS IN JAPANESE] [SPEAKS IN JAPANESE] They say, "But do you send that letter?", boss. Well, let's get on with the lecture now. Folks, we'll show you just how democracy really operates. We'll hold an election right in this village. Gonna organize this village. Is the mayor here? Here's the mayor. White coat. We'll have to get him a new white coat. We wouldn't want a new mayor. Keep the mayor. Very hard to find a white coat. We got the mayor. Now we need a chief of police. And a chief of agriculture. Now, who'd make a good chief of agriculture here?

He draw lovely picture of golden wheat, butterfly-- Sakini, just because he draws a very nice picture of wheat, that doesn't make him an experienced wheat farmer. Wheat not grow here anyhow, just sweet potatoes. Oh, all right. Well, if he's their choice. Fine. Now, we're gonna have to have-- [SPEAKS IN JAPANESE] What'd he say? He want white coat like mayor, boss. You said that we can't get-- That's all right. If he don't get a white coat, we'll get-- You know what we're gonna do?

Now for the ladies. Now, we're gonna organize a-- I know what it is, it's a Ladies' League for Democratic Action, and we're gonna have to have a league president. Now, who'd make a good league president for the Ladies' League for Democratic Action? The ladies like that. They never vote before. Fine. [SPEAKS IN JAPANESE] [CROWD SHOUTING] Higa Jiga. They say they want Higa Jiga. She gonna make a classy president. I'm sure. [SPEAKS IN JAPANESE] What? Yes, I know. Helmet. No, never mind. I understand. Tell her I'll get her a helmet too.

You don't have to shout. I can hear you. This is Colonel Purdy. [GIGGLING] Yes, sir. Just thought I'd check up on you. How are things going? Anything I can do for you? I can't think of a thing, sir. I realize it's bound to get lonely for you down there. So you know what I'm gonna do, my boy? Now, what are you gonna do? I'll tell you. I'm gonna send you some of my old Adventure magazines. No. No, I don't want them. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir, very much. I-- I would like something to read, sir. How are you getting along with the natives? Well, it's an age-old problem, sir. It's a question-- A struggle to see who's going to lose face. I understand. As Mrs. Purdy says, "East is East, and West is West and there can be no twain." But you are making progress? Well, nothing that I'd like to put on paper, sir. Well, send in a detailed progress report. Well, if that's what you'd like me to do, sir. Yes, sir. You'll find that these people lack the capacity for sustained endeavor. Don't hesitate to build a fire under them. I don't think that that will be necessary, sir. Don't forget, the eyes of Washington are on you, Fisby. Oh, I hope not, sir. I hope not. It just occurred to me. Have you given any thought to physical education? Well, I-- I don't think that-- You know, sir, that was a masterpiece of timeliness, sir. Thank you, my boy. Could you use a deck of cards? Sir, I-- Hello? Hello? Fisby, you're getting weak. [MUFFLED] No! No! Well, be good, my boy. Keep up the good fight. Bye-bye. [SPEAKING IN JAPANESE] [GRUNTING] No, wait. Just a minute-- [GRUNTS] Oh! Sakini! [COCK CROWS] Sakini!

[SPEAKING IN JAPANESE] Do you want some tea, boss? No, I don't. No, no, no. [SPEAKING IN JAPANESE] Oh, you want to hear some music, boss? No. No, I don't-- [SPEAKING IN JAPANESE] She say you jealous, boss. [SARCASTIC LAUGH] [SPEAKING IN JAPANESE] You want to tell her your trouble, boss? Tell her my--? W-what? Now, what do I want to tell her my troubles for? Oh, she geisha girl, boss, that's her business. Yeah, some business. Some business. [SPEAKING IN JAPANESE] Oh, no. Oh, she very sad, boss. Mm. She want to help you because she-- She say you best boss she ever have. You not take money from her. You not make her work. Do you mean to tell me that the men who owned her hired her out and then--? And they took money from her? Oh, sure, boss. Oh, well, now, really. I mean-- You know, where I come from, the men who do that sort of thing-- Oh, you got geisha business in America too, boss? No, but-- Well, I mean-- Look, will you please explain to her I have no intention of-- Of making her work, and I'm certainly not going to take money away from her. I mean, that's-- Why not, boss? She pay dues to geisha guild. She member in good standing. This is really-- I mean this is the most immoral thing I've ever heard of. No, I mean, I don't say, Sakini, that where I come from we don't have, uh... Uh... Well, you know. But I mean, by golly, we don't have unions. And we don't set rates and we don't collect dues. No, no, boss, no. Geisha girl not do what you think. Wait a minute. Everybody knows what they do. Oh, no, everybody wrong, boss. What do they pay her for? Hm? Oh, you-- Well, very hard to explain, boss. Poor man like to feel rich. Rich man like to feel wise. Sad man like to feel happy. So all go to geisha house and tell trouble to geisha girl. Now, she listen very politely. She say, "Oh, that's too bad, boss." She very pretty. She make tea, and she sing, and she dance, boss. Pretty soon, troubles go away, boss. So that not worth something, boss? Sakini, I apologize to you, I-- I-- I really apologize. I-- I'm-- I'm very glad you cleared things up. That's kind of-- That kind of puts a new light on things. [SPEAKING IN JAPANESE] She say-- She say why you smile at her all of a sudden, boss? You mad or something? Sakini, I-- Will you ask her if she'd be kind enough to give geisha lessons to the Ladies' League for Democratic Action? [GIGGLING] [TRADITIONAL JAPANESE MUSIC PLAYING] Boss! Oh, boss! [SPEAKING IN JAPANESE] They all come to see you, boss. Oh, what can I do for them? Oh, they have a meeting in democratic fashion and majority agree on resolution. They want you to build them a chaya. A what? ALL: Chaya. A teahouse, boss. A teahouse? Sure, now that Tobiki got geisha girl like big city, boss, they want a teahouse like big city too. They say you give Ladies' League what they want, boss. I can't build them a teahouse, Sakini. I have no authority to do that. Oh, you say rule of majority is law, boss. You gonna break the law? No, I'm not gonna break-- [SPEAKING IN JAPANESE] Konnichiwa. Well, look, they're going to have a school, you see. Now, that's enough. Oh, school. Well, majority too old to go to school, boss. They want have chaya, a teahouse. We haven't got the materials to build a teahouse. Ah-so. [SPEAKING IN JAPANESE] [SPEAKING IN JAPANESE] Ah-so. What'd she say? Oh, she say yesterday big Army truck come and leave lovely lumber and beautiful paint, boss. That's right. It's for the schoolhouse. No, it just can't be done, folks. Oh, okay. No, it just can't. [ALL GROANING & MUTTERING] They-- They say you very mean to them, boss, after presents they give you everything. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, folks. I'm really very sorry. Oh, they very sorry too, boss, because Tobiki like to be proud, boss. Teahouse give them a face. It's gonna be a fine school. Five sides. May I speak, captain-san? Yes, of course, Mr. Oshira. There are lovely teahouses in the big cities, but the men of Tobiki have never been inside them. We are too poor. All of my life I have dreamed of visiting a teahouse where paper lanterns cast a light in the lotus pond, and the bamboo bells hanging in the pines tinkle as the breezes brush them. But this picture is only in my heart. I may never see it. I am an old man, sir. I shall die soon. It is evil for the soul to depart this world laden with envy or regret. Give us our teahouse, sir. Free my soul for death. Well, we haven't any carpenters. [SPEAKING IN JAPANESE] ALL: Daiku-san! Daiku-san! Oh, boss. Oh, boss, what you think? Mr. Sumata and-- And papa-san just come down from mountain right now. [LAUGHS] [ALL CHUCKLE] All right, all right, I haven't got a chance. I guess Uncle Sam is going into the teahouse business. Captain Fisby! ALL: Hooray! Uncle Sam! ALL: Hooray! [ALL SINGING IN JAPANESE] [SIGHS] [RINGS] Hai. Thank you. Captain Fisby. Hello. This is Colonel Purdy. Oh, yes, sir. How are you, colonel? I want to talk to you about your progress report. There's nothing in here about the new schoolhouse. Didn't you get the lumber? Yes, sir. Oh, yes, sir. As a matter of fact, we're using it out there now, sir. But, uh, colonel, I think we're gonna have to have some more. I sent ample according to specifications. How big a structure you building? Well, sir, we have to consider expansion, you know, population increase. We don't need to consider expansion. Our troops will be out of there by the next generation. Which brings me to another point. What's this about six kids being born last week? Well, sir, it's the only thing I could fill the progress report with, sir. Then you've failed at your indoctrination. Don't you know yet that births are entered under population increases? They're not considered progress. No, not children, sir. Kids. Goats. There must be something wrong with this connection. It sounded just as if you said "goats." You see, I'm trying to increase the livestock down here. Goats? Look here, Fisby, suppose some congressman flew in to inspect our team. How would I explain such a report about goats? The population of civilians alone concerns us. I want to know exactly what progress you've made as outlined in plan B. Well, sir, I'm, uh, getting along with the people. In other words, nothing. Listen to me, Fisby, do you know what Major McEvoy has accomplished in Awase? No, sir. Then I'll tell you. His fourth graders know the alphabet through M. His whole village can sing "God Bless America" in English. I wish I could say the same. Well, see that you do. I don't want any rotten apples in my barrel. I want to know exactly what you've accomplished in the five weeks you've been down there. Ahem. Well, sir, now-- Well, we have started an industry. Matter of fact, we're sending our first shipment out this week. Now, we're making getas. We're-- Wait a minute. What in thunder is a geta? No, it isn't a geta, sir. It's plural. Getas. Getas, you know, you have to have two. Are you breeding some animal? No, no. You see, you wear them on your feet. And they're very good for the metatarsal muscles, colonel. And now, I have another group. They're out there making cricket cages. Captain Fisby, what kind of cages did you say? Cricket cages, colonel. You know, the cricket. The black bug that-- It rubs its hind legs together. I think we can sell just thousands of those cages. Of course, we don't supply the cricket. Naturally, not. Captain Fisby, have you taken your salt pills? Oh, yes, sir. Every day at chaya in the pine grove. Have you been going out in the sun without your hat? You see, I wear a kasa, sir. It's a-- The wind blows through the straw. It kind of ventilates the brain. I see. I see. That'll be all, captain. Gregovich. Yes, sir? What's the name of that psychiatrist over in Awase? Captain McLean? Yes. You get him on the phone. My man at Tobiki has gone completely off his rocker. [HORN HONKS] [HORN HONKS] BOYS: Good morning. Good morning. Hello? BOYS: Good morning. Good morning. [CHILDREN LAUGHING] Oh, thank you. Thank you. Oh. Uh... Excuse me. I'll see ya. Bye. Well, who are you? Oh, you startled me. I'm Captain Fisby. Can I do something for you? Oh, well, I'm Captain McLean. How do you do, captain? There was nobody here, so I came in. Medical corps. I see it. See? Huh? What are you doing out here in Tobiki? Hm? I'm on leave. Oh? Just thought I'd spend it down here... Uh-huh. Making some ethnological studies... Oh? of the natives. If you have no objection. No, I don't have any. That's in your way. I'll take it. I was just examining that. That's my cricket cage. Oh, you like crickets? I haven't found one yet, but I have the cage. Matter of fact, I've got two. Would you like to have one? Oh, no, no, no, thank you. It's all right. Ahem. What happened to your uniform? Oh, it's around. It's around. I find getas and a kimono much more comfortable in this climate. But isn't that a bathrobe? Well, it passes for a kimono. Why don't you take your shoes off, captain? Oh, no, thank you. Thank you, no. No? I'll just keep them on. All right, fine. No objection, of course. Sit down, sit down. In my good chair, my good chair. Thank you. Well. No? Hm? May I ask, uh... Mm-hm? whatcha building down the road? Hm? Oh, that's my chaya. You know, that's gonna be really something to write home about. A chaya? Mm-hm. See, if you have a geisha, you gotta have a chaya, you know. How have you felt lately, Fisby? Mac, I'll tell you something, I have never felt better. I feel reckless and happy and carefree and-- Well-- And it all happened the moment I decided not to build that pentagon-shaped schoolhouse. The what? The good colonel, he ordered me-- He ordered me to build a pentagon-shaped schoolhouse down here. Well, the natives, they wanted a teahouse. And would you believe it? One of them gave me a geisha girl. So I decided that I was going to give them what they want. I guess it sounds kind of crazy to you, doesn't it? [LAUGHING] Well, yes and no. You know, these are wonderful people. Wonderful people with a strange sense of beauty. Hard-working-- Hard-working when there's a purpose. You know what they're doing out there? They're making cricket cages, lacquerware, chopsticks to sell as souvenirs to the people up north. Don't let anybody ever tell you that these people are lazy. Oh, that's-- Oh, I see. No, you don't. You don't. Oh, I see. No, you don't, no, no. But you will when you get a chance to study them. So you're building a teahouse. Yes. You know what I'm gonna do next? I'm gonna go out and test that soil. See if it won't grow something besides sweet potatoes. I'm gonna send for some nitrate, some DDT and chemicals-- Chemicals? Yes. You want to poison these people? What are you talking about? No. Look, captain-- What? What? I'm sorry. You just touched on a subject that's very close to my heart. Gardening. Yes? You know, for years, I've been on a point of giving up my career just so that I could set up an experimental farm, somewhere where I could raise vegetables organically, nature's way. No poisons, no chemicals. Let me tell you something, captain. Chemicals will kill all your earthworms. And earthworms aerate your soil. They do? Do you know that the earthworm leaves castings eight times its own weight every day? That much? Organic gar-- It's the only thing. Compost. Manure. But no chemicals. You know a lot about this, I can tell. Well, I-- You do. I subscribed to all the farm journals for years, you know. Mac, listen to me, I've got-- I've got the greatest idea. While you're down here, you could really do us a big, big favor. Sure. A big service, mind you. You could sort of take over supervision. Establish a kind of a-- What do you call it? An experimental station. Huh? Well. Hm? Oh, I haven't got the time. Take time, man. Take time. Now, this is a chance for you to put those theories into facts-- These are not theories. These are proved facts. Just tell us how to go about it. That's all, Mac. Is your soil acid or alkaline? Oh, golly, I don't know. That's the first thing we've got to find out. You're just the man we need. You're a genius. I'll want plenty of manure. You'll get it. And I want to set this program up scientif-- Oh! What's the matter? What is it? I wish I had my books, my seed-- Oh, I've got a stack of seed catalogs that high. You have? Oh, man, and I-- Well, let's sit down here. Sit down, sit down. You know what you can do? Write down a list of those catalogs, those books you've got. We'll have the airstrip boys fly 'em in. Can you do that? Sit down. Can I do it? Of course, I can do it. Make the list-- Every spring I've made lists of seeds. I never had any soil to put them-- Oh, now I can actually germinate. Make the list. Make the list right now, we'll get started right away. Corn: golden bantam. Yes. And country gentleman. Right. Hybrid. I gotta check-- Hybrid. Hybrid? Yes. I gotta check with my department of agriculture now. But I'll be back. I'll be back this afternoon because you and I, we'll have tea in the pine grove, Mac. See, we have tea in the pine grove every afternoon when the sun goes down. Cucumbers: early green prolific. Oh, and radishes! Crimson giant. [PHONE RINGING] Crimson giant. [PHONE CONTINUES RINGING] There's no answer, sir. What do you mean there's no answer? Well, keep trying, I'm not the kind of a man to take no answer for an answer. [PHONE RINGING] Tomatoes: ponderosa earlyiana. Watermelon. All-American gold medal. [PHONE RINGING] Hello. Who is this? This is Captain McLean. This is Colonel Purdy. Can you talk? Why not? I'm anxious to hear your report on you-know-who. On who? Captain Fisby. The man I sent you down to examine. Oh, uh, well, colonel, looks like I'll have to be down here several weeks. Several weeks? Well, Rome wasn't built in a day. What? I said, Rome wasn't built in a day. Well, you're the doctor. Thank you, but I expect to work miracles. Splendid, splendid. Is there anything I can send? Some old Adventure magazines or anything? Say, colonel, uh, there are a couple of books I'd like, uh, I don't think you could get them. You name them. Well, one is the Principles of Pea Production, the other one, The Do's and Don'ts of Cabbage Culture. Oh, and, colonel... do you think you'd lay your hands on a soil test kit? A what? A soil test kit. I wanna test the soil down here, see if it's sour. Sour, did you say? Well, yeah, if soil is sour, your seeds won't germinate. And, oh, I'd love to lay my hands on some bees. There is something wrong with this connection. And you know I'm gonna have to take some time out. I gotta build up this soil, you know, with manure. Did you say manure? Yeah. Nature's way. Oh, I've lost faith in chemicals. You kill all your worms. Oh, let me tell you, colonel, when you kill a worm, you're killing a friend. Hello? Gregovich. Yes, sir? Where's plan B? What did you want, sir? I wanna see who I sent to analyze an analyst. [SPEAKING IN JAPANESE] That's hot water. Hot water. Hot water. That's it. [BOTH GIGGLING] Oh. Hm? Captain Fisby-san. Oh! Hey! Hey! Mac, Mac, come on, over here. Over here. I got a list of seeds here. Put some more hot water in the pot 'cause we have a guest here. Uh, uh, this-- This is Lotus Blossom. You know? How do you do? That's the geisha girl I told you about. Konnichiwa. She can't speak English. She doesn't need to. No? Oh, hey, the seeds. You sit-- Sit down here, will you, Mac? Oh, thank you, I'd like that. Have some of this tea. You know some--? Mac? You know that's real jasmine tea. Really? Here's a pillow. Thank you. Take off your shoes. Now, about those seeds, if we-- Sh. Sh. Sh. No. Sh. Now, we're gonna sit here and we're gonna watch the sun go down. And we're gonna contemplate the end of the day. [CLEARS THROAT] [KOTO PLAYING] [SINGING IN JAPANESE] Look, captain, I'm sorry to interrupt. Do you suppose you could let me have a couple of boys to help me in the fields? Mac. Darn Japanese beetles are eating up all the Chinese peas. All right, I'll get Sakini to get a couple boys to help you out, all right? Oh, good, thanks. Alrighty. Now, Mac? Sit down, Mac, and listen for a while. Uh, Lotus Blossom, will you sing it again for my friend Mac here? Thank you. Mac, but quiet, huh? All right. Here we go. [SINGING IN JAPANESE] Boss?

Yeah, put it up here. Use this. All right. All right? Come on, let's go. [GOAT BLEATS] What's this? Now, what's happened here? All the souvenirs come back, boss. What do you mean "come back"? You mean to say they didn't sell? No, the soldiers who look at the straw hats say: "What you think we are? Hayseed?" Mr. Oshira, look, you were at Yatoda, what happened? The Navy always spends money. Sailor said, "How much you want?" I said, "25 yen." That's good. They say, "Oh, too much. "Can get better in five and 10-cent store. Give you one nickel." Didn't you tell them, Mr. Oshira, that every one of those cups is handmade? They say, not care. They say, at home, have big machine make 10 cups every minute. They say, "Take nickel or jump in lake." How do you like that? Boss, you gonna stop work on the teahouse? No, we're not going to stop work on-- They're gonna get that teahouse, Sakini, if they don't get anything else. By golly, you can tell them that I'm very proud of that work that they've done. I'm so proud. And you can tell them too, Sakini, that I'm very proud of them. No, I am, I-- I really am. And I don't understand this. No, no, no, I don't understand this. I don't understand this. Boss, they sure wish they could make some money to spend in the teahouse, boss. Because they not like to go poor like beggar. I know, I know. [SPEAKING IN JAPANESE] See, he say, boss, it not your fault no one buy souvenir. Well, they going home to get drunk now, boss. You know, I don't blame them, Sakini. If I could find something to drink, I'd do-- Wait a minute. Wait a minute, folks! What are they gonna get drunk on? Oh, they got nothing but brandy, boss. Nothing but brandy? Nothing but brandy? How are you gonna manage to get brandy? Oh, we make a very fine brandy, boss, from sweet potatoes. Been making for generations. You make brandy yourself? Yeah, sure, boss. You want taste some? [SPEAKING IN JAPANESE] Ah-so. Here you are, boss. Ahem. Mac, Mac, my dear friend, Mac. If this stuff is only halfway good, we're-- Oh, man, we're really in business. This is one thing our men-- They'll buy this. Look, it may not be any good. You know, some things even our troops won't drink. Well. Take a sip, boss. I wanna smell it first. [ALL LAUGH] Obviously it has a kick. Yeah. Ahem. How old is this stuff, Sakini? [SPEAKING IN JAPANESE] Seven years? No, seven days, boss. Oh, no, no, I mean, it wouldn't smell like that in seven days. They make it last week, boss. Here, you try it, will you, Mac? You're a medical man. You give it a try. You first. No, you're my guest. I waive the honor. You know, anybody ever die or go blind from this? Oh, we not dead, boss. We not blind. Of course not. You see? Come on, Mac. They've worked up an immunity over the years. You see, I don't wanna kill one of my own countrymen, you know? There must be some way to test this, isn't there, without me--? There isn't, huh? Well... [GOAT BLEATS] Sakini, get me, uh... Get me Elsa Maxwell. One goat coming up, boss. Elsa Maxwell. That's who we need. That's Higa Jiga's goat, you know? We'll test it on her, you see? Well, what you gonna prove? Goats have hardy stomachs. No, look, if this brandy-- If this... If this passes the goat test, we're really in business, you know? You know why? No Marine will ever admit that his stomach is weaker than a goat's. SAKINI: Hey, boss, you gonna make a guinea pig of goat? Yeah, gimme something to put it in, Mac. Anything at all will do. Helmet? That's fine. That's just fine. Oh, Elsa Maxwell very lucky goat, boss. Better hold her head, Sakini. All right, doctor, proceed in the name of science. Take it easy. Take it easy. We're either gonna have an industry or goat meat for dinner. [LAPPING] What are you doing? Oh, not too much. [CROWD CHUCKLES] She likes that. Hey. Hey. She all right? All right? What do you think, doc? It doesn't seem to affect her. Reflexes okay. Well, here goes. [CROWD CHUCKLING] Huh? Oh. [CROWD LAUGHS] Hey. Where you going, boss? I'm about to form the Cooperative Brewing Company of Tobiki. [ALL CHEER] Shh! [SPEAKING IN JAPANESE] [CROWD SHUSHES] Officers' Club at Awase, please. We gonna make brandy, boss? I'll tell you in a minute. Officers' Club at Awase? This is Captain Fisby speaking at Tobiki. Yeah, oh, major? Major, this is Fisby. Yeah, you know, when I was with your unit we had a hard time keeping a supply of liquor at the club? You remember? Yeah, well, major, I think that I have stumbled onto something that might be of interest to you. Uh, yes, as you know, uh, Tobiki is the, uh, heart of the brandy industry. Brandy! Did you say brandy? Yes, brandy. Look up the word "sweet potato" in my dictionary, Mac. See if there's a fancier word for sweet potato. Oh, I'm here, major, yes, here I am. Uh-huh. Yeah, now, look, major, I think I might be able to supply some of that brandy to you, that is, of course, if you're willing to pay the price and you keep the source secret. Yes. Hm? Oh, they've been making it here for generations. Oh, yes. As a matter of fact, I'm sure you've never tasted anything quite like it. Hold on a minute, major. The Haitian name for sweet potato is B-A-T-A-T-A, batata. Major, you've heard of, uh, Seven-Star Batata, haven't you? Oh, ooh, well, they make it here in Tobiki. Yes. Seven Star got him, I think. Brandy eight or 10-day-old better. Nine or 10-day-old. Major, we also have Eight Star Batata, and we have Ten Star. Of course, the Ten Star, now, mind you, that comes a bit more expensive. Yes? That will run you, uh... one hundred occupation yen a gallon. Ten yen. Delivered. Yes. What? How many? Five gallons. Yes. Five gallons will be delivered in one week. It'll be delivered by our Department of Agriculture. Yeah, right. You're welcome, sir. Right. [ALL CHEERING] All right. All right, let's-- [PHONE RINGS] Hello? The news kind of gets around fast, huh?

Can't have a teahouse without a pond. Yeah, where's your goldfish? You have a lotus pond, you gotta have goldfish. Whoa! [ALL CHEERING] Hey, boss! Everyone send me to bring you to teahouse opening, boss. Mac, look. Isn't that something? This first class, boss. Hey, boy, that's really something, Sakini. How about that, huh? Well, come on, let's go. Well, lead on! Okay. [WIND CHIMES JINGLING] [LIGHT CHATTERING] Take shoes off, boss. [SPEAKING IN JAPANESE] Thank you. Good evening. Boss, you sit here. Lotus Blossom gonna dance in your honor. Hey, Mac, you hear that? She's gonna dance. Come on. Sit down, Mac, you farmer. This is in my honor. How can I stall Purdy so I can stay down here?

That mean you give your heart to her. Well, I do. We all do, huh? Wasn't it beautiful, Mac? Oh, she can dance in my chaya any day. Pardon me, sir. Are you sure this is Tobiki village? According to the map, sir. The place seems to be deserted. There was a light over there. Come on. What? What is this? Sakini, what do they want? They want you and doctor to sing song. Sing? No. All right, come on, come on, Mac. Come on, we're gonna sing something. How 'bout--? How 'bout "Deep in the Heart of Texas"? Why not? There aren't any Texans here are there? We're gonna have some fun now. Sakini, look. You know, I want-- They're gonna help us out. When we clap and sing "Deep in the Heart of Texas," they join. Oh, I know that song. Very nice, boss. We demonstrate. What is it? St-- Stars at night. [BOTH] â™ª Stars at night Are big and bright â™ª â™ª Deep in the heart of Texas â™ª â™ª Deep in the heart-- â™ª [WOMEN SPEAKING EXCITEDLY] MAC: Deep in the heart of Texas. â™ª Deep in the heart of Texas â™ª [SLOWLY] Deep in the heart of Texas.

[SHOUTING IN JAPANESE] I see you, Fisby! Fisby, I see you! Where are you? Where are you? Where are you? Fisby! Fisby! Come out here! Come out of here! PURDY: Come out of here. Come out of here. Sit down! How many lectures have you delivered to the village children on democratic theory? Well, now, let me see, sir. Four, five? No, no, no, it wasn't that many. Three? No. Two? No, no. You've only delivered one lecture? None, sir. Don't tell me you haven't delivered a single lecture? Yes, sir, I've not delivered no lecture. Any lecture. Have you organized a Woman's League for Democratic Action? Yes, sir, I did that. I sure did. I sure did that, sir. How many lectures on democratic theory did you give them? Uh... None, sir. You can't mean none. You must mean one or two. No, just none. I refuse to believe it. Oh, I'm very glad, sir. Sir, I must go. Where? My seedlings are wilting. I have to transplant them. Captain, you'll pack your gear and transplant yourself to your unit at once. Yes, sir. They'll die. Yeah. This is murder. Please, take care of my beans. Now, is the schoolhouse finished? No, sir. Why isn't it finished? Well, we-- We haven't started. What did you do with the lumber I sent? We-- We built a teahouse. I don't suppose you have any aspirin here. Huh? I-- No, I don't think so. What, in the name of occupation, do you mean by saying you built a teahouse instead of a schoolhouse? Lotus Blossom, she had to have a place to teach the-- The Ladie'' League geisha lessons, sir. Fisby! Yes-- Yes, sir? What? Uh... How could you sink to such depths, man? Well, I was only giving in to what the majority wanted, colonel. I don't doubt that statement, not at all. It's a sad thing it took a war to convince me that most of the human race is degenerate. I thank my stars I come from a country where the air is clean, where the wind is fresh-- Oh, for heaven's sake, sir, there's nothing that goes on in a teahouse that your own mother couldn't watch. You be careful how you use my mother's name, Fisby! Well, my mother, then, sir. Sir, there's nothing immoral about our teahouse. Answer me this. What is bringing all that occupation money to this particular village? [RINGING] Uh, it's, uh-- Well, answer it. No, no, no, no. It's nothing. Nothing. It might be for me. It's not-- Answer it. No, you see, this phone, it rings all day. Then I'll answer it. Hello? What do you want? Who is this? Well, Commander Myers, you must have a wrong connection. This is not a brewery. [SIGHS] Yes. Mm. Yes. Yes. Oh, I see. I see. I see. Well... there was nothing else that we could make, colonel, that anybody would want-- Would want to buy. Brandy! This ends my Army career. And I promised Mrs. Purdy I'd come out a general. You've broken a fine woman's heart, Fisby. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. You've sullied the reputation of your nation. All right. And all the tears-- All right. Shall I kill myself? Oh, don't minimize this. You don't know the enemy's genius for propaganda. Well, what have you done with all the money you've made so dishonestly? I banked it in Seattle. Oh. That's despicable. Making a personal fortune off the labor of these ignorant people. I haven't touched a cent of this money, colonel. Now-- Now, it's all banked in the name of the Tobiki Cooperative Company. See, everybody in the village, they're all partners, don't you see? You know? You know, share and share alike. That's communism! It is? [SOBBING] I'll be lucky to get out of this war a private. Captain Fisby. Yes, sir? You will consider yourself under technical arrest. You will proceed to HQ at once to await court-martial. I intend to wipe this stain from our country's honor. Gregovich! GREGOVICH: You called, sir? I did. [WOMEN GIGGLING] Yes, sir. We have some business to attend to here before going to Awase. Yes, sir. I'm glad to hear it. Captain, may I congratulate you on what you've done for this village? It's a dream. Thank you very much, sir. It's an alcoholic dream. It's one vast distillery. I want you to take a detail and some axes and smash every still in this village. Destroy them? [LAUGHS] Beyond repair. I want you to take another detail and rip down that teahouse. But, colonel-- Pile the lumber beside the road. That's an order. Do you understand? Yes, sir. [BANGING] [WOMAN SOBBING] [SPEAKING IN JAPANESE] I know. [SPEAKING IN JAPANESE] Aw. [WEEPING] [â™ª] Hot water. [GIGGLES] [SPEAKS IN JAPANESE] [MUTTERS] [SOBBING] Uh, boss. Sorry, boss. Uh, jeep all loaded now. I'll be along in a minute, Sakini, uh... You gonna take Lotus Blossom with you, boss? Sakini. Ask her for me if there's anything that I can do for her before I go. Ask her. [SPEAKS IN JAPANESE] [SPEAKS IN JAPANESE] What--? What does she say, Sakini? Oh, she say she want to marry you, boss. Now, why--? Why would she want to marry me? Oh, she say you nicest man she ever see, boss. No, no, no, you-- You tell her for me that I'm clumsy. I-- I got a talent for destruction. I'd only disillusion her just-- Just the same way I disillusioned all her people. [SPEAKS IN JAPANESE] [SPEAKS IN JAPANESE] She say she-- She-- She like to go to America, boss, where everyone happy, sit around and sip tea while machine do work. Tell her I'll never forget her. I'll never forget this village, and on the other side of the world, in the autumn of my life, when an August moon rises in the east, I'll remember what was beautiful and what I was wise enough to leave beautiful. [SPEAKING IN JAPANESE] [SPEAKING IN JAPANESE] She say, boss, that she never forget you. And, uh, she like you to know that she gonna make up a long song-story about you to sing in the teahouse. And she say maybe in 100 years from now, you gonna be famous all over Okinawa. I'd like that. I'd like that. [SOBBING] [SPEAKING IN JAPANESE] Oh, he sure want to push her wheelbarrow for her, boss. [SPEAKS IN JAPANESE] She say okay, but not to think that, uh, she's his property. [CHUCKLES] He very happy fellow, boss. [SPEAKS IN JAPANESE] She going now, boss, but you still her boss. So she say she not go till you drop fan from face. [SPEAKS IN JAPANESE] I've written a full report of this whole affair to your commanding officer. I'm only glad you don't belong to my outfit. I won't tolerate rotten apples in my barrel. [RINGS] Hello. Who? What? When? Oh. Uh, sit down, captain. Sit down. Sit down. [CHUCKLES] Make yourself comfortable. Sit down. Uh, give me your hat. Uh, have some of these tsukemonos. Help yourself. Take your shoes off. I-I'll be right back. You going now, boss? Yeah, I guess so, Sakini. I... Hey, boss, since you not take Lotus Blossom with you, maybe you take me? No, Sakini, no. I work for you for half price, boss. No, Major McEvoy is coming down here to take charge, and, uh... Well, he's gonna need your help, you know? Oh, you very hard man to bargain with, boss. Okay. You want, I work just for rice ration. No. You mean, you gonna make me work for nothing, boss? I mean, yes, you're not going to work for me at all, Sakini. No, you belong here. Okay, boss. Tsk. Whoa, boss. You know what I think going to happen when American leave Okinawa? No, what? Oh, I think we gonna have to use pentagon-shaped schoolhouse for teahouse. [LAUGHS] [BOTH LAUGHING] So long, Sakini. You're a rare rascal. So long, boss. Say, you know, I'm going to miss you. Hey, boss. Yes? You not failure. I'll tell you something, Sakini. You know, I used to worry a lot about not being a big success. I think I felt an awful lot like you people felt, always being conquered. Well, you know, now I'm not sure who's the conquered and who's the conqueror. So. I've learned in Tobiki the wisdom of gracious acceptance. See, I don't want to be a world leader. I've made peace with myself somewhere between my ambitions and my limitations. That's good, boss. Well, it's a step backward in the right direction. Take care. Socks up, boss. Sakini! Sakini! Sakini! Sakini! Where's Captain Fisby? Oh, right over here, boss. This way. Fisby! No, no, no, no. Over here. Fisby! Fisby! Fisby, come back here at once! I'm not in shape. Too much paperwork. You called, sir? I've been looking all over for you. You can't leave. You've got to stay here. You've got to help me, Fisby. I don't understand, colonel. We've got to pull this village back together again. The lid has blown off of everything. Where's Gregovich? He's out there. They're breaking the rest of the stills. Oh, no. Why, what's the matter? I radioed the report to Washington. Some fool senator misunderstood. He's using this village as an example of American get-up-and-go in the recovery program. We're all over the newspapers. That's wonderful, colonel. It's not wonderful. A congressional committee is flying over here to study our methods. They're bringing photographers for a magazine spread. Tonight, Fisby, tonight. That's bad, that's bad. Gregovich! Um, colonel, wait, maybe there's some way we could stall 'em. Ah, maybe we could quarantine the place or something, huh? You can't quarantine a congressman. They've got immunity or something. Oh. Fisby? Yeah? Help me. Yes, sir. I don't ask it for my sake. I ask it for Mrs. Purdy. I could be a brigadier yet. Gregovich? Gregovich! Gregovich! Gregovich. Did you call, sir? Come here, come here, Gregovich. Come here, come here. You haven't destroyed all the stills, have you, Gregovich? No. No, of course you haven't. Ooh, yes, I have. [SLURRING] I carried orders out to the letter. Why can't somebody disobey orders once in a while? What's happened to the American spirit of rebellion? [COUGHS] Sunstroke? Uh, potato brandy, sir. [CHUCKLES] PURDY: Sergeant, wake up! Do you hear me? That's an order. Colonel, I'm afraid he's passed out. It's desertion. I need every man. Gregovich, get to your feet. Come on, sergeant. [GIGGLING] Come on, sergeant. Gregovich! I want to ask you some questions. Sorry, sir. Stop weaving. You're weaving, sir. I'm standing perfectly still. You smell like a brewery. Oh, well, I fell in a vat. You got drunk? No, sir. I fell in a vat. Naturally, I had to open my mouth to yell for help. Go to the office and sober up at once. Yes, sir. Oh, sergeant. Uh, sergeant. Fisby. Yes, sir? I think I'm going to need you. Stand by. Yes, sir. [AIRPLANE APPROACHING] Oh, no. [AIRPLANE ROARING OVERHEAD] I'm a sinking ship, scuttled by my own men. I know. Colonel Purdy? Don't bother me. Stills not all destroyed. I haven't got time... What did you say? We not born yesterday. We get the sergeant drunk. Give him water barrel to break. Sakini, my friend. You're not saying this just to make me feel better? No. Stills as good as ever, boss. Production not cease yet. Sakini, you really are a rascal. No. He's really an American. He's got get-up-and-go. Sakini, listen. If you could get the people in the village to work together, how long do you think it'd take them to rebuild the teahouse? Oh, we not destroy, boss. We just take away and hide. Come here. Now we gonna show you Okinawan get-up-and-go. [SHOUTING IN JAPANESE] [MAN SHOUTING IN JAPANESE] [ALL SINGING IN JAPANESE] [DRUM BEATING] [SHOUTS IN JAPANESE] Be right back. [ALL SINGING IN JAPANESE] [SPEAKS IN JAPANESE] It's a land of mystery in the Orient. It's-- It's beautiful. It's simply beautiful. There's only one thing wrong. It needs a sign to tell people what it is. And we ought to put another sign up over there, naming this Grace Purdy Avenue, and another sign-- Sir, how about a nice cup of tea? Hm? All right? Come on, colonel. [WOMAN SPEAKS IN JAPANESE] Oh. Twenty Star for the colonel, Sakini. Okay, boss. Little story now concluded, but history of world unfinished. Lovely ladies, kind gentlemen, go home to ponder. What was true at beginning remains true. Pain make man think, thought make man wise, and wisdom make life endurable. So may August moon bring gentle sleep. Sayonara. [â™ª]
