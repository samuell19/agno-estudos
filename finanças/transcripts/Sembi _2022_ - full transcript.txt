Our colony residents and Selvi served food for those who took part in the play Selvi said they're staging the play at the bus stand today 'Good hearted souls!' They are screaming their throats dry for justice for a 10 year old girl child - No one to even serve them water - Already late They are gossiping here 'I believe 2 boys fainted in that protest yesterday' 'That's why I thought let me do what little I can for this cause' 'Woke up early, cooked and I'm taking food for them' So you emptied quarter sack of rice you had for your use You are talking as if you bought it with your money, son What is the side dish you cooked for them? - Burnt brinjal chutney - Wait, 1 minute Buy those youngsters chips or some other snacks What is your name?

On 24th morning - Sembi was selling honey - 'Okay' - Especially now is the season - 'Yes' 2 men came up to her 'Asked her the price' She quoted a high rate They decided not to buy as it was too expensive Couldn't this child have kept her mouth shut? 'Don't even have the means to buy my honey' 'You roam around dressed tip-top' She has asked them 'Will they swallow this jibe?' They got enraged and hit her 'What happened then?' 'Honey flask broke and that child fell down' This was fabricated as news adding ears, nose, mouth to it Opponent party used it to their advantage - Not knowing this fact, everyone is- - Hello Mr Politics - What? - Did you watch this at close quarters? Am I jobless or what? I don't have enough time to serve the people Then who saw it? Our fruit shop Balu was a witness Fruit shop Balu was watching that girl instead of taking care of his shop? - Balu was keeping an eye on his fruits - Okay 'Line man Selvam saw this' And he shared it with Balu - That's it - Oh! That means line man Selvam was watching the girl instead of the line! Bro, I don't know if Selvam watched while he was on duty Or where, when, what I don't know those details That cowherd What's his name? Madasamy told line man Selvam, that's all Oh! Then even Maadasamy wasn't grazing his cows Was staring at the line man, huh? Yes... hey! 'No, don't hound me by cross questioning' Don't grate me like a coconut 'Allow me to think' As it is I suffer from chest pain I have high blood pressure 'Please listen to me, son' In this area, fruit shop Balu has credibility and dignity If he conveys any news 100% it will be true What, lady? I'm talking here You are giggling over there? 'If you have any information on that child, say it openly' Aren't you Pushpa akka's husband? Yes, I'm that precious gem's husband Our biriyani shop Kumar and your wife Pushpa'kka They were caught roaming around the lake together What? Near the lake? Who saw them? Our boat man Murthy saw them near the lake Who? Murthy? So he wasn't rowing but watching them? Not Murthy alone - Ice cream seller Rajesh also saw - So Rajesh wasn't selling ice? He was only watching them, huh? Not just watched them But questioned them too! What did he ask? He asked them, 'why are you buying just 1 ice cream when there are two of you?' I believe Pushpa akka replied 'We are 1 soul in 2 bodies' '1 ice cream will do for us' 'What a lethal bullet!' Rajesh told you all this crap? - Not to me - 'Then?' - He told our line man Selvam - 'To Selvam?' Our Selvam has told fruit shop Balu Fruit shop Balu told me Who? Fruit shop Balu? He's himself a big fraud and you're believing him! Did you say he's a fraud? 'In this area, fruits hop Balu has credibility and dignity' 'If he conveys any news 100% it will be true' - You said so - When did I tell you? Rascal! I will get even with him Then what about claiming the child wasn't raped? The child was raped It is a fact, bro Since this incident was in favor of the ruling party We started to twist it to our advantage Sorry, bro Stuff your lipservice sorry Dai! Liar liar Pants on fire! Does your mouth have a tongue or a flipping 'dosa' ladle? You're changing every 2nd minute Listening to your side of the story 'Poor child, so innocent I thought ill of that tender heart' We vote for hypocrites like you We should hit our heads against a rock! Yuck! What specimens! Will you spread awful rumors like this? - Driver - 'Yes, constable' 'Stop at the toll gate I'll get down' 'Okay, sir' - Hello friend, how are you? - Good, constable sir - Is your duty on this side today? - Yes From this morning, why are police jeep and ambulance ...cruising around Kodaikanal? They held up my bus by 15 minutes claiming they were checking it Is it some new terrorist on the run? - Not that - Then? Gang rape of a 10 year old in Puliyur village, you know? 'Regarding that case' Yes, I also heard about it Our inspector Masilamani had gone to enquire about that case During the enquiry, inspector and villagers got into a heated argument The irate villagers ganged up and beat him black and blue - People hit the inspector? - Yes, friend He has 18 stitches on his scalp alone it seems 25 stitches below his neck He's very critical I believe Real torture! Usually he's serious faced Now his life is in serious condition? 1 minute Tell me, Muthu For me? Okay, I'll take care 'They have sent a photo' Can I see the photo in this, Anbu? It's a big deal you could even talk in this! How can you see in this? Why don't you buy a Smart phone? Don't even ask! I had 3 phones All three got flicked in my own station! Then imagine our plight! We don't even have time to think of our plight! Whose photo on the phone, sir? Photo of the accused 'Don't let him escape if you nab him' Kill him in an encounter It isn't a 'he' but a 'she'! - What are you saying? - Anbu The villagers did not bash up the inspector Then? Just one old lady 'I'll take leave' One old lady? 18 stitches above neck and 25 below the neck! Inspector serious She isn't an old lady But a bold wild lady Stop the vehicle 'Vanakkam', sir Keep moving Next vehicle, move forward Keep going Sir, please keep moving Don't stop Go... go Child? Grandma We are getting down now Why, ammachi? I'm so scared, grandma Don't be scared I'm there for you, let's get down - Sekar - 'Sir?' - First clear the way for ambulance - 'Yes, sir' Send them Come... come Sekar, did you check the buses? I came by this bus Checked already Go, Anbu, keep moving 'Go... go... go' Keep moving... go... go Go... move 'What a creature' Sitting still, frozen from the beginning like the raven drenched in the rain If we had 10 such old ladies in each town law & order in Tamil Nadu can be saved Present police stations can be shut tight Govt can save money Sir, if you say 10 old ladies per town On an average 4 taluks make 1 district If there are 40 old ladies per district Tamil Nadu has 38 districts So 38 x 40 =? Oh! So you're saying if we can find 1520 bold old ladies Tamil Nadu's law & order can be salvaged! 'And present police stations can be shut down' Your planning is superb, Anbu sir Good Bro, are you a hard core fan of Captain Vijaykanth? You have all the statistics at your fingertip! - Conductor - Sir Come here - What, sir? - Statistics at his fingertips, huh? Do policemen look like half baked idiots to you? Sir, watching and listening to people, words tend to spill in a flow, no? Was that in a flow? You were hitting below the belt 'What did you say?' If there are 10 old ladies, law and order can be salvaged, huh? 'I thought they would be a physical support' Then shut down the existing police stations You want Tamil Nadu police to be care of the sidewalk, without food? Sir, why are you making a single old lady's plight as a State issue? Did I exaggerate?? You are the culprit Not me, that smart bro seated over there Watch me now Kindly repeat to this sir whatever you told me now What did I say? 'Yov...!' Giving me a first time look? 'Hey...!' I saw you when I purchased the ticket I'm talking to you here and why are you playing with words there? This Smart Alec played Played what? Do you know the problems we police face? Hello sir, if we go to the police station to complain about some issue Do you know the problems we face? After struggling to go in I paid heavily for my loss too What difficulty and what loss? My neighbor's dog poops everyday outside my house I repeatedly requested them to put the dog on leash They never listened 'So I complained in the police station' Instead of filing the complaint in 1 sheet They made me buy 1 quire! They must have also asked for other stationery items like pen, pencil, eraser? Even the ruler to draw the margin! 'I bought that too' They would've taken your complaint and shooed you saying they will call you 100% right That dog must be crapping still in front of your house, man Yes, it did not stop shitting! My wife who never gets angry flew into a rage Tweaked my ears and asked me 'If you had given me that 1 quire paper instead' 'I would have myself wiped that poop daily' She keeps knocking on my head with her knuckles 'I can't even massage my hair with oil!' - Hey! - What, da? Only reason I prefer to be a bachelor If that old woman had been like me '...would this have happened?' What are you saying? Conductor Since that old lady got married - She became a mother - Yes Since her daughter got married - She has a granddaughter - Of course Only then her granddaughter roamed around in the mountain That's why she got raped What logic is this? - Conductor sir - Huh? 6 months ago my niece was riding a scooter Banner of some Party, tied to the median flew from nowhere and fell on her face She lost control and fell A lorry from behind ran over her and she died on the spot! So when we lodged a complaint against the political party that erected the banner The cops arrested the press owner who printed the banner! How is this logic? I don't understand - Don't you get it? - No, I didn't If I slit your Adam's apple and eyes with this knife Sorry, grandma - Police won't arrest me - Then? They will arrest the bladesmith who made this knife! Why won't they arrest the owner? Owner would have greased many palms, right? Is this the norm, bro? If you don't question anything, worse things will happen What more is left to happen? Policemen who are least bothered about a child rape case Are searching for an old lady as if she's a terrorist! 'Times are so cruel!' 'In the upcoming Legislative Council election' 'Kindly cast your precious votes to-' Police officer Grinding stone symbol Aren't you going in search of that old lady? If I don't get my hands on her I'll murder you! 'Why will you kill me?' 'Why are they on a rampage like this? - Conductor, did you hear that? - 'Pain in the neck' Yes, I heard Grinding stone symbol Bro, can an old lady beat up an inspector so badly that he's critical? I can't digest that Some chap disguised as an old lady must have bashed him up You know the next move? Due to pressure from the higher-ups 'If an old lady like her is sleeping in any bus stand' They will grab her by the neck like a hen and close the case in one swing Grandma Madam You are responding 15 minutes after I called you How can you be so dimwitted? Listen, don't get off without my permission If you get caught, they'll close the case saying you are the lady they are hunting! 'Am I clear?' 'Pretend as if you heard' 'I blew the conch I had to!' What world are we in? They have hidden the rape case of an innocent child And how disgusting! Magnifying the case of an inspector being bashed up Did I hear you say the police force is disgusting? - If you utter the word 'police' once more - 'I am asking you' I'll hit you with an old sandal Hey! I'm asking you Will you hit us with an old sandal? Don't I have the right to hit my own mouth? Do it with all your strength You know who is fighting for his life after being accosted? A police officer A rowdy old lady has bashed him How dare you all support her! 'He's called 'honest' Masilamani' If an old lady had no option but to hit him, what was the provocation? 'What else do you expect?' 'He would've expected a bribe to close the case' She would've refused and retaliated Would he have asked for money from a clan that has never seen 10 or 20 rupee notes? Then why did he go to that grandma's house after a week? Correct questi- My sandal will speak! What else? Only for compromise You are talking as if you were closely associated with this case? Yes, no action was taken even after 1 week of lodging the complaint My brother-in-law's brother-in-law is secretary to Chief Secretary in Chennai 'I went and met him' 'In my second information report' He asked me to add just one sentence Attempt to murder by sending a dog to bite I added brackets front and back and gave the report to him Next day just 1 phone call from Chief Minister's cell Before the dog could poop in the morning the cops would've come to your doorstep 100% that's exactly what happened 'Sabaash!' What? - Bravo, huh? - No, I meant Subash... Suba- What's your problem with the police department? - 'Sandal' - Sorry, sir Uncle, you won't stop until the verdict favors you or the dog - Continue - Surely So the mongrels who raped that child The inspector went to support those scumbags and got bashed up, right? Yes, he had gone for a compromise on behalf of the accused Our grandma lost her cool and bashed up that fool! Sir, stop supporting her without knowing the facts Do you know who her clan is? They cultivate poisonous mushrooms, plant cannabis around Kodaikanal They smuggle red sandalwood It is the main occupation of that clan We know because we go on raids Not only that, sir Revenue officer and I went to a mountain village to take a survey We opened a biscuit packet because we were hungry 'Around 10 or 15 girls' Came running behind our car asking us to buy them something When we said there's nothing in the shop They said 'at least give us money' Because they were begging we gave them Rs 5 as alms They flung it on our face And demanded 50 bucks! Really cheapos 'Tahsildar got really tense' Sir, if you had given them Rs 500 they would've come to your guest house! 'That's how they make a living' This is how that old lady helped her granddaughter into the car and bid her tata Something violent has happened at the place she went and she was hurt That old lady used this to bargain more money from them They didn't comply 'In order to extort money' Immediately she called her granddaughter And misguided her Registered a false case too The inspector who knew the truth went straight to her house Told her 'you sent your granddaughter willingly' 'And so this can't be considered a rape case' 'The old lady was shocked' Realised he knew the truth and was upset she can't extort money So she hit him and escaped 'Immoral woman!' Not sure which chap she is colluding with now 'Not knowing these facts you are justifying her cause' If only I get hold of that old lady I'll chop her into pieces Chop me to pieces now 'Grandma!' Go on, cut me to bits Instead of killing us with your words bit by bit Finish us off once for all We will at least die peacefully Kill me now What did you say? If you give 500 rupees, we'll go with you? Are we such immoral shameless people? We weren't jumping with joy when we had a handful of money We never felt sad or upset when our pockets were empty either We don't know to grow marijuana plants Her parents worked as tourist guides In a mountain forest fire accident They saved 10 lives and were charred to death! When my daughter was fighting for her life 'She wished to see her daughter' Look at her, dear Look at your child to your heart's content Look at her, my dear 'My daughter begged me with her eyes to take care of Sembi and passed away' From that day, I've been taking care of her like a precious gem Until I get her married to a good man I am asking superpower to give me the strength and lifespan When my family is already in such a bad shape Will I destroy some other family? Sir She can never be a biological mother The doctor said so 'Our family lineage stops with her, sir' 'She is leading a life of a lifeless corpse, a zombie' 'I am myself in the depths of despair not knowing how to cope, sir' Did that inspector come to my house with fair play in his mind? He joined hands with the rapists And came with foul play in his heart to negotiate my granddaughter's silence! I told him I don't need his tainted money I need justice for my granddaughter When I told him those heartless criminals have to brought to justice He said, 'they have clout and connections' 'If they come here' 'They will wipe you and your granddaughter like an used tissue and go' He threatened me to withdraw the case! I refused to do so He tied a knot around my granddaughter's neck and pulled She is already suffering physically and emotionally That's why I bashed him I bashed him up and ran from my house People like you who live in the plains If you are repulsed by people like us who live in the mountains We will get off this bus 'Stop' Make the grandma and child get down Hello! You can't just come and take her away Only a lady police can arrest a lady and escort her We also know law, sir Sir, do you have an arrest warrant? How can you arrest someone without a warrant? Do you watch a lot of movies? She has hit an inspector and you expect us to produce a warrant? Did you ask if we know law? Do you know what section 509 is? 'Get it into your head' 'To prevent Govt employees from doing their duty' Stopping the police from doing their work Arrest these girls under ABC section Let go of my hand, sir Take your hand off first How can you pull a girl like that?

Over' Sir, bus is sticking to Vadakavunji route We're following at a distance of 10 km, over - Son - 'Yes, sir?' - I don't understand this - What? Why were the fake police bent on targeting the child? If she points an accusing finger at them, that's it Minimum sentence of 10 years And maximum, death penalty One of the two verdicts is confirmed This gang is terrified of being identified That's why they're trying to kill her What is it, son? Didn't you listen to grandma? They have connections in high places Enough money to grease many palms Can't they close the case? Is there any law without loopholes? Sir, in this law, there are no loopholes, nor can you drill fake holes! - What is that foolproof law? - POCSO Act 2012 Protection of Children from Sexual Of fences A much needed harsh law drafted to protect children from of fences of sexual act 'It is a global and universal act' Sir, in any case, we have to struggle to prove the accused is guilty But in this act, the accused has to prove his innocence Sir, not just that Supreme Court as Apex court is the final judiciary tribunal If the judge feels the victim's statement can be believed, that is more than enough Without any evidence whatsoever The Apex Court has given the rights to the judge to pass the judgment immediately 'In a recent case in Bihar' 'Sasikanth Rai A special court judge' He passed the sentence the day the accused was brought to trial In all the rape case rulings in India 'This case is still talked about for its lightning speed verdict' 'This is the strength of POCSO Act, sir' If our law is that strong Why should this grandma be on the run? 'Poor old lady, sir' 'She doesn't know anything' True that, son I've been travelling and even I don't know all this 'How will she know all this?' 'That's how the inspector easily duped her' Sir, by law only a policewoman should have handled this case But their greed for money made them cover up the law Son, aren't you an advocate? Let's file a POCSO case I've already done that, sir Love you, brother How incredible! In the midst of all this ruckus in our bus I thought you were pecking the ground like a chicken looking for grains Were you doing this all along? 'Super, son' Enough of looking Come away, madam You took Rs 20 from me, eh? As if you gave me Rs 200 for me to show you 'Baahubali' Child Take this chocolate - Is the session over, da? - Huh? Is the session over? Only now the warrior has mounted his horse! - Make it fast - Oh! I see It may be another hour, right? - Is this POCSO court? - What? Looks like a play school Think you can fool me? I want my cash back Trust me, man 'This is POCSO court' 'Selling salt to the sea, eh?' Is that fool playing on the wooden horse a judge? - Hey! - Sir? - Door is here - Sorry, sir Take this Registering Kodaikanal Sembi case as a private complaint - Have you noted the serial? - Done, sir Waiting for the signal for a video call Once we get signal we can nail them online 'What are you looking at, my dear boy?' Till then we must take good care of Sembi 'Of course, we will' Bus is plying at a distance of 3 km from us, sir 'When you get near the bus inform me, over' Muthu, speed up Why is Tiles calling? Tell me, Muthusami Hey Politician! Will you dump me in the middle of nowhere and save the old lady? 'If I take your wife Pushpa's case' How can I ditch you? - 'You'll die of shame' - No, Muthusami 'I have given your to the department' They are tracking you 'Don't get down in the middle for any reason, we will miss the reward' Call me when the police nab her Okay? They are dead meat! You traitor! Is this why you took down my number? May some wild bear drag you away! Okay, Vasu, thanks Sir, my friend just called There's a police check post beyond Vadakavunji, sir They are checking all vehicles If we turn right before that, we can go down through the pine forest, sir Shall we take that route, sir? Is your plan to take everyone along and kill them with poison? What are you looking at, flour-face? How does a villain suddenly turn hero? I have a conscience too, sir 'When did you find out?' - Trust me, sir - I won't trust you What was that? You sucked on a jackfruit aril happily Asked me repeatedly 'Do you want?' - Didn't you? - Sir If born as a human one has to repent and reform one day or the other If you are born a human being! Your face is boring, bro Turn the other side Sir, I have a child her age At least now you remembered Brother, what is our next move? Once we get the Zoom link from the court we should make Sembi talk to the judge - Okay, brother - I have a relative in Vadakavunji I'll ask him to get a jeep You take this grandma and girl and escape, sir Only criminals should run and hide Not us, huh! Muthu, stop the jeep 'Control room calling patrol 3, over' Patrol 3 receiving, over 'Did you spot the bus? Over' No, sir, at Pethuparai the GPS signal got cut sir, over 'Keep following in the same route, over' Connect it Right away, sir Sir, it's ready - Child - Anna Tell the judge exactly what happened, okay? Hmm, good girl 'You must tell them what happened' 'Look at the camera and talk' What happened that day on the way to the shandy?

'It hurts in that place even today' 'Do you know?' Tell me, Maha Judge has got the statement from Sembi through a video call, sir - Has he recorded the statement? - 'Yes, sir' Who is the investigation officer? DSP Rosma Mary, sir Rosma Mary If you find out anything else update me immediately, okay? The girl said she saw a blue car This is a hilly area So it's definitely a 4x4 vehicle Let's take a list of vehicles- Right, we'll take the list from the RTO' We get their addresses and search for all the accused By then this child will become a grandma and grandma will become a great grandma That's what you wanted to say, right? That inspector also knows who they are If we get his number- 'I know, son' My friend Raghavan is a cyber security consultant I'll get the full list of people the inspector spoke to We can then talk to everyone We can find out their identities Brother, cyber crime needs at least 2 mins of talk time to retrieve their numbers Instead, those working in Telecom can easily get that information for us Hey!

He's blowing up this small case into a giant balloon He'll use this to get to power, just wait and watch Sir, we won't let that happen That inspector must survive He must talk He must tell the truth The culprits must be punished 'Sir, Adhiyaman has accused you of sending fake cops to kill the child' 'What is your comment, sir?' I heard about it You know what they will do next, son? They will kill that inspector with their own men And then throw the blame on me Dharani, be careful Thank you, sir Done But I won't let that happen I've sent my men Doctor?

Not yet sir, over Then child Sembi has seen Ezhil Vendan's party vehicle The vehicle must have entered and exited in Kodaikanal toll gate If we get the footages from the toll booth They can be nabbed by asking Sembi to identify No big deal Sir, your dear friend That head constable He is at the toll gate You ask him, he'll give it Who?

That too, only those 3 days, dude? - Inspector - 'Don't know, dude' 'All other days are intact' He bribes to close the case - 'Thanks, I'll call later' - He tries to strangle Sembi He deletes the footage at the toll gate with precision Did that Inspector take such risks to save an ordinary Party volunteer? Something fishy He said, 'they have clout and connections' 'If they come here' 'They will wipe you and your granddaughter like an used tissue and go' 'He threatened me to withdraw the case!'

Why are you calling the howling noise at the street corner as voice? Do you know my analogy for that old lady and her supporters? A dog smashed into a mess lying dead on the highway No one will come even to burn or bury them Cars will run over them one after the other This society will crush them till they rot along with the tar on the road String them and drip-dry in the hot sun Their bodies will be gone with the wind! With all the personal problems people have will they be cleaning the road diligently? What do you mean by class, voice or noise? - Dude - 'Tell me' I've been feeling from last night Something drastic may happen to us Some bird is tweeting as a gut feeling, man Bird?

A photo with the college students who saved her is viral online now What are you saying? News of the lawyer who escorted Sembi to the magistrate is viral now My granddaughter is alive? That's all I care about 'I have prayed the culprits should be caught' 'Your wish hasn't gone waste, sir' Child Sembi has identified your son and his friends as her rapists Your son's photo is trending online What is your comment on this, sir? - Excuse me, sir - What is your question? Fast Court in Dindigul has issued a summon to your son to show up tomorrow We have got the Press release copy, sir What do you say to this, sir? Pre climax in Adhiyaman's screenplay is simply superb Brilliant twist Court opens in the morning, right? Justice will triumph in the climax No more questions 'Sir, why are you worried?' 'I've covered their tracks and greased all palms' 'Created all the evidence on our side to the T' 'Be confident, sir We are sure to win' 'On the day of the crime' 'These 3 boys were not even in Tamil Nadu' 'They were attending a wedding in Goa' 'Their flight tickets from Chennai to Goa' 'On the same day, bills for checking into Goa International hotel' On 25th at 11 in the morning 'Their return tickets from Goa to Chennai' I have submitted all these in the court here, sir 'Sir' Since the villagers were talking of the grandmother having a lot of cash Masilamani said he was going to visit the grandmother for an enquiry 'Taking the blood samples of my clients' I have submitted their DNA test results, sir' Sir, we sent the semen samples from the victim's body to the lab We got a report stating 3 different DNAs were present Did you match the 2 reports? I verified the two yesterday, sir They didn't match, sir Sir, he is Opposition party leader Ezhil Vendan's only son 'Pre-poll surveys show his father will win the coming election hands down' 'Some ill-wishers have brought a girl raped somewhere by someone else' 'These boys have been blamed unfairly greasing the victim's palm' They are enacting a drama, sir Prosecutor - Sir - Any cross examination? Sir, for the clout and connections they have They can create evidence with more dates left untampered Why just an airlines ticket, sir? If they set their mind, they can show us a plane and claim they chartered a flight 'Sir' It is said, 'if a lie is repeated it becomes the truth' That's how they have tutored and brought this child here She is repeating the same lies Sir, what I'm saying is POCSO Act is very harsh Many people are using it in the wrong way A few innocent boys like them get caught in that web of deceit 'Prosecutor' Defense lawyer has submitted all the evidence in proper order DNA reports do not match Based on the child's online statement while traveling from Kodaikanal I cannot pass judgment 'Do you have any evidence?' Yes, sir, I have evidence and proof of evidence destroyed at the crime spot Kindly repeat that I have evidence of evidence destroyed at the crime spot 'Produce it' Madam There were 5 cameras at the crime spot All 5 cameras Show corrupt footage only on 24th, sir The previous day and next day of this incident 'When we checked if their car had crossed the toll gate' 'Footage only on these 3 days in particular are missing, sir' 'I searched with their phone #s to prove they were in Kodaikanal on those 3 days' 'Call history of those specific 3 days have been deleted, sir' 'They have done a clean job of erasing all the required evidence' 'They have even prepared proper back up of being somewhere else on those 3 days' 'I have to prove from my side now' You will adjourn that to the next hearing Your job is to pile up adjournments 'My job is to bring my client to court' But my client has miles to go before she can sleep, sir She has to study and become a doctor Sir, please look at this child 'Poor girl, sir, instead of playing as a carefree 10 year old' 'She is sitting huddled up in fear' 'Scars of this barbaric act embedded in her body and mind to heal will take years' 'Walking to and fro to court to wrap up this case' She should not forget or for ego her dream By punishing these 3 boys Her shattered womb cannot be retrieved But if they are let loose so many children her age ...will walk the same traumatic path I am fighting this case to prevent the same fate falling on those children Sir, we address a doctor who saves lives only as 'doctor' But we address you as 'My Goodness' Do you know why? Justice is more precious than life! All this word play sounds good to hear, sir Court needs evidence when it is a proceeding Do you have any strong evidence? How will you conclude this case? Sir, 1000 pieces of evidence will be needed to prove a lie as truth But if you need evidence to prove truth to be truth How can that be truth, sir? 'The only evidence I have' Ammachi! 'When this child entered this court' There were many of us men present We are still present here I didn't see any kind of difference in her eyes When she saw these 3 boys 'That child was terrified' In that panic state I saw 1000 pieces of solid proof in her eyes So as per Apex court A rape accused person could be convicted Based on the victim's sole testimony This court finds it Trustworthy and credible 'So I sentence' Accused 1, Mathivendhan 'Accused 2' Akshay 'Accused 3' Surya This court sentences the three of them To life imprisonment for the rest of their natural lives 'On judicial note I punish them with life imprisonment' 'Till death' 'This earth of ours is not ruled by Super power' 'Money' What are you looking for? - Where is that Anna, ammachi? - That's right, where is he? There, he's walking away Look over there, grandma Thank you, sir Thank you so much Come, my child Hello, Sembi Sit down What is this, my son? You restored my granddaughter's life and walked away without a farewell Forget that, please sit down I want to pay you lawyer's fees I don't mind the expense I'll send it to you in installments Is that so? She gave it to me - I have to go, see you - Okay Future doctor Ace your studies, okay? - Ever grateful to you, son - Bye, ma Tata Ammachi We never asked that Anna his name True that 'Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself [MATTHEW 22:37–39] - Jesus' 'With love Prabhu Salomon' 'Long live!' 'Long live our Chief Minister' 'Long live our leader' 'Long live our Chief Minister' Sir, the pre-poll surveys claim you will sweep the polls I thought I can take rest for 5 years Looks like my people love me!
