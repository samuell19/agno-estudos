A story? Yeah. One of your special Christmas stories. I'm not sure our tree is quite finished yet. There's one thing left… The Christmas star! This is a very special star. It's been in our family for generations. It's beautiful. My parents let me put it up on the tree when I was a little girl. Your father put it on the tree when he was a boy. Now you're old enough, it's your turn. Really? Someday, Samantha, you'll pass this on to your children. Because it's a tradition. And traditions are the stories that families write together. So, are you ready? Our tradition. Yes, I'd like to confirm my reservation. Samantha Murphy. That's right! The main lodge, for the week of Christmas. Thank you so much. I've always been partial to the star. Oh, hi Samantha! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas. I always have a tough time deciding. Victoria's waiting for you. I'll walk you in. Great. So, how are you? I'm good. Well, let me get right to it, Sam. When we published your book last year, we knew we'd found a talented new writer with her own voice, and a lovely story to tell. And, fortunately, our readers agreed. Oh, that is so nice to hear. Thank you. Now, you know that every Christmas, we publish a slate of holiday books. These projects are very popular with our readers. Obviously, we have to put together titles a year in advance, and this year, we'd like you to write one of our Christmas books. Your work has so much heart. Your characters are so… authentic. It's a perfect fit. Well, I've… I've never actually written a Christmas story before, so… That's the best part. We take your fresh voice, add just the right touch of mistletoe and holly? Our readers will love it. And what better time to come up with ideas than now? Everywhere you turn, it's Christmas! Everywhere you turn. You're a wonderful writer, Sam. I really want this to work out. For both of us. Okay. I'm in. Good. Well, you have yourself a holly, jolly Christmas and get those creative juices flowing. We'll talk again at the beginning of the year. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas. Congratulations! I mean, that seems like a great opportunity for you. Simon, it is. Writers wait years for a chance like this. It's just… it's a Christmas book. Ahh. That's difficult. Yeah. It's just I write from a place of inspiration. It has to feel real. And how am I… how am I supposed to write about this when Christmas hasn't felt like Christmas in years? Before my parents divorced, we would go to my Nana's house and she had this list of traditions we would all do as a family, and we would check them off as we finished. That's a great memory. It was so great. And… the holiday shuffle took over. My sister and I were bouncing from mom and dad's. I mean, we tried to I the traditions alive, it just… it was never the same. I know how much you miss your grandmother. Especially now that the holidays are here. Just… it won't feel like Christmas without her. And now that dad's selling the house, there'll just… there'll be nothing left to go back to. That is why you and I are going to Aspen to celebrate Christmas. It's going to be our first Christmas together, and I intend to make it very special for the both of us. Who knows? It might spark some ideas for your book. But what if I can't write it? Or… What if… you write a really great book? You'll be famous, always on the road, signing books, speaking to your hordes of adoring fans… we'll never see each other… You know what, you're right. Don't write it. Terrible idea! Don't write it at all. Thank you for making me feel better. I'm your biggest fan. Oh. One guess. You're producer. News never sleeps. …and the most handsome newsman in all of New York City is mine. I'm just an in-the-field guy. I'm gonna get that anchor job, and you, my dear, are gonna write a great Christmas book. Taxi! Bye. Bye. Hi. Here we go. Now we're talkin'. Hey, sis. Hey! Am I interrupting? Uh, nope. Just.. Taking a little break. How are you doing? Great, you know. Just trying to wrangle a class full of third graders for story-time on the last day of school before Christmas break… Have a good Christmas! I can only imagine. Yeah. Did you, per chance, read your mail yet? My mail? No. Why? You're gonna want to read your mail. Hey, Kiddo. I thought I might hear from you today. Hey dad. So, what do you make of Nana's invite? Yeah. I talked to her lawyer, and uh, looks like she set all this up in August while he was there helping her to set up her estate. She always had somethin' up her sleeve. Well, you know your grandmother. Yes, I do. It won't be the same without Nana, but… this'll be our last chance to spend Christmas at her house. And I think it would mean a lot to your grandmother for us to be together again. Then I'll be there, dad. Great. Okay, sweetie, I love you. See you soon. Love you too. those holiday treats that you loved so much as a kid, may be as close as your nearest street corner. I'm Simon Baker in Manhattan wishing you a very merry Christmas. We're out. That was pretty good. Hey! That was great. Yeah? Thank you. Yeah. There have been a change of plans for the holidays. Okay? So, my Nana made arrangements for the whole family to spend one last Christmas together at her house in Cedar Ridge, so… Wow. Aspen will have to wait. Well, one last Christmas at your grandmother's house, that sounds great. Yeah. Colorado will always be there. I think this is way more important. You're not too disappointed? Nah. I know how much you love your grandmother. I think this is a really good way to honour her. Thank you. Besides, I think it's about time that I see that hometown of yours, don't you? What? Yeah! You wanna go with me? I do! What about your family? It doesn't really matter where I spend Christmas, as long as I get to spend it with you. And, besides, I love your family. You're the best. I don't know about that. You're the best! Well… maybe. Thank you. ♫ ♪ Christmas is here again ♪ ♪ Christmas is here again ♪ ♪ Christmas is here again ♪ ♪ Everybody's home ♪ ♪ for Christmas ♪ This is it… what do you think?

Hi, Ben. Sammy Murphy! Is that you? Hi! Oh! Oh! Back home for Christmas. This is my boyfriend, Simon. Simon, this is Ben. This is his diner. Nice to meet you, Ben. Oh, pleasure's all mine. I don't suppose Samantha told you how her literary aspirations blossomed right here, in this very diner? No, she didn't. Well, see that booth over there? Hmm-Mm. Back in high school, she would sit there for hours. Hardly ever looked up from her laptop. That is true. Yes. Well, we're on our way to the house to see dad, and I was hoping to bring him a surprise? Ah, say no more! What's the surprise? You'll see. There it is! Here you go. It's my family's own secret recipe holiday eggnog. Aaah! Let me… Oh, no! It's on the house. - Thank you so much. - Thanks. Merry Christmas. Thank you. Merry Christmas! Aw, it's so good… so good to see you. It's so good to see you, darling. Thank you, Ben! Merry Christmas, Ben. Great to meet you.. - All right. - All right. Wow. It's beautiful. Yeah. It is. Come on. Dad? There she is! Ah! Aah. Awe. Hey dad. How are you? Oh, better for seeing you. Simon. Welcome. Good to see you. Hey, good to see you too, Bill. We come bearing gifts. Mmm-Hm, Ben's eggnog. Well, now it really is Christmas. Thank you, honey. Yeah. Well, I'm going to, uh, put the bags away and give you two a chance to catch up? 'Kay. Oh, thanks, Simon. Okay. Uh, Sam's room is top of the stairs, first door on the right, and the guest room's at the end of the hall. Ok. Be back in a minute. Okay. Thanks, sweetie. So. When is mom getting here? Actually, she is coming with Annie and Mark, and they should be here any time soon. Are you sure you're okay with all of that? Why wouldn't I be? I mean, you haven't been in this house together since the divorce. Well, since your mom moved her practice to Connecticut, it's not like we actually travel in the same circles anymore. You know what I mean. Yeah. Sam. Your mom and I just… grew apart. But that doesn't mean we can't spend Christmas together. Especially when it meant so much to your Grandmother to have us all here. Yeah. Nana and your mom were always very close. I see you got started on the lights. Yes. Hmm, I thought, well, since we're here, why not hang a little Christmas cheer? Do you want some help? I was hoping you'd ask. Okay. Oh, here we go. You almost finished the ribbons, sweetie? Workin' on it. Ah! They're here! Ahhhh! It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas! How are you? It's been too long! Looking good. You too. Hey, Sam? How's it going? Hi Mark! Simon, how are you? Thank you so much for coming! Good to see ya! Mom! Sweetheart, oh! I am so glad you're here. I'm so glad you are here. Oh, and Simon. How are you, sweetie? I'm good, how are you? So happy you could join us for this. All the stories that Sam's told me about this house? I had to see it for myself. Yeah, there's a good many memories here. I bet. Yeah. There sure are. Hello, Bill. Claire. Hey, uh, look what Mark made for all of us! Right! Yes indeed. Oh, yes, it's gorgeous. What do ya' think? Hey! That's beautiful! That's so nice. Thank you. Yes. Merry Christmas. Uh, let me help with your, uh… your luggage. No, I've got it. Yeah, I'd be honoured. Thank you. So, a Christmas book. That's kind of cool. Yeah. It is. I'm just… I'm having a little trouble getting into the spirit it needs. Yeah, I miss Nana too. Feels like she should be calling us downstairs to have hot chocolate right now. Or going for a walk through the snow, looking at all the Christmas decorations. Oh, yeah. But hey. Maybe going back there will make it better. Plus, Simon's here, so that's inspirational, right? Why? Stop it! Well, I'm just saying, it's a big step to bring him home for Christmas. I mean, are there wedding bells in your future? I think those are sleigh bells. Dad hung them on the door. Okay. Seriously. You've been dating for a year, you cannot tell me that you haven't talked about it. We haven't talked about it. We both have a lot on our plates right now; I have a book I have to figure out how to write, and he is always on call with his job. Sam… ni Trust me. Simon and I are on the same page about this. Marriage is just not in the picture right now. Okay. …Yeah, I'll stick around for that, of course. Sure, uh-huh. Yeah, sure thing, Jack. You keep me posted. Great. Sorry, that was my news director from back at the station. Everything okay? There's a crazy coincidence. There's a local Christmas story here. In Cedar Ridge? In Cedar Ridge. And they want me to cover it while I'm here. It would air on Christmas Eve, so this is a much bigger story than I've ever had before. That's amazing! Yeah! And, believe me, this… This is a really nice story. So… what do you think? I think that it's going to be your best story yet. I think so too. Thank you. So, this… this past year. Yeah? It's, um, it's been good, right? Where did that just come from? I just… I mean, you're happy with the way things are? We're on the same page, right? Yeah, of course. I couldn't be happier. Okay. Ooh, something's being delivered. Maybe an early Christmas present. I wonder who it's for? Hey! Hey! We, uh, we got a package; it's from Nana's lawyer. What does it say? Ah, here. Thanks. Hmm. It's a letter. Oh. Well, read it, Sammy. "My dear family. "Merry Christmas and welcome home. "It's been much too long since you were all together. "I only wish I could be with you. "I ask that you put aside your sadness, "and enjoy Christmas the way we always used to. "Just in case you forgot, I've included a list. "My wish is for you to complete this list as a family." What's the list? Oh! Oh my gosh, that's all of our old Christmas traditions. "Put up all the Christmas decorations." "Pick a tree from Finch's Farm and decorate it." "Make gingerbread cookies." "Drink Nana's hot apple cider." Of course! "Go ice skating." Um, ya? "Get our family picture with Santa at Benjamin's Diner." "Go to the Cedar Ridge Christmas Dance!" "I love you with all my heart, "Merry Christmas and God Bless. Nana." Wow. Yeah. Your grandmother always knew how to make Christmas special. It'll be like old times. Hey. Hey! What are you doing? Just… looking over the list. It's like I could hear her voice again. "Brought back all these memories. "Traditions are the stories that families write together." Something she used to say. Hmm. I like that. Yeah. Well, she'd like you. I'm glad you think so. Because, I wanna start a new Christmas tradition. Okay. For us. Okay. Are you okay? I had a whole speech prepared, and suddenly I can't remember a word. But, uh… Samantha. I love you. And I want to spend the rest of our lives together. Will you marry me? - Congratulations! - Congratulations! Oh! Yes. Yes! Yes! - Yes? Yes? Yes!!! - Oh, my gosh! That is fantastic! - Oh my gosh, congratulations! - Congratulations, guys! Morning. Good morning. Still an early riser, I see. You too. Old habits. Uh… So the girls tell me that your practice is doing well. Yeah. You know… busy. And… how's retirement? Are you missing life with the Cedar Ridge police department? Well, some days I still get a little antsy, but no, it's… it's going pretty well. Gives me lots of time to do other things. It must be a nice change, not running out at all hours, on call 24/7, cop on the beat. Well, it was my job, Claire. And as I recall, we were both kept pretty busy there after the girls moved out I was trying to make partner. You know, I think I will take a walk before we start decorating. It's pretty cold out there. Yes. I know. It's winter. But, uh, I'll be fine. Thanks. Hey! Sam! Hey, there you are. Here I am. I was just thinking about the best way for us to tell my parents. Right. Your parents. I was pretty excited last night, so I emailed them to let them know we have some pretty big news. Wow, this is… all happening so fast. So I was thinking we could call them and tell them together? Yeah. Sure. Hey! Don't worry, they love you, Sam. They're gonna be so excited about all of this. Come here. Got enough lights there, Bill? We'll be able to be seen from space at night. Well, Mark, you can never have too many Christmas lights. Uh, that's not true actually dad, remember? Remember what? Uh, oh nothing. Nothing. No, no, n-no. When Annie and I were kids, dad put up so many Christmas lights, he actually blew the fuse box in the house. Okay, that is an exaggeration. No! We had to eat dinner by candlelight, and we had no electricity for two days. Not how I remember it. Of course. So, have you two picked a date yet? Mom! What? We just got engaged! Well, what about a summer wedding? Which is six months from now! Six months is plenty. Yeah, but then you get into June showers. No, no, no, no. It's April showers, that ends with May flowers. Which, by the way, is a good thing. Right. Mm-mm. Spring or summer, you should not have an outdoor wedding. Trust me. Ugh. Not this again, Claire. Bill insisted on an outdoor wedding. I just wanted something beautiful, is that so bad? I told him you can't have an outdoor wedding during rainy season. But would he listen to me? Of course not. I just wanted this one thing. It rained on us. And I thought that was romantic. My hair didn't think so. You know what? I'll, uh, put a few of these lights back. Yeah, dad. I'm gonna help you. Okay. It's a long list, so where should we start? - We should get our tree first. - Gingerbread men, definitely. We always decorate our tree first. Well, the house always smells so nice… Okay, so now what do we do? Ice skating. Oh, yes! Ice skating it is. ♫ ♪ Jingle bells, ♪ ♪ Jingle bells ♪ ♪ Jingle all the way! ♪ ♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride ♪ ♪ in a one-horse open sleigh! ♪ ♪ Hey! ♪ ♪ Jingle bells, ♪ ♪ Jingle bells ♪ ♪ Jingle all the way! ♪ ♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride ♪ ♪ in a one-horse open sleigh! ♪ Ready?

In all the excitement, we did forget one very important thing. What's that? This. Supposed to go on your finger. Right? Uh, yeah, um… umm. I hope it fits. It was my grandmother's. My grandfather had it specially made for their wedding. Wow, it's um… It's beautiful.

I keep waiting for Christmas to feel like Christmas and I just don't know if… if now is… is the right time. Okay? Um, look, I understand. You've got a lot going on right now. I do, but, we just… we never talked about this. You know? And it just all seems to be happening like, really fast. It's a big step. And if you… if you need more time… You guys ready to go for a whirl? Another Murphy family tradition? I hope the rest of the list is this fun. Come on, you two. Okay. I'm sorry. Let's… let's talk about it when we get home. Okay? Hey, mom, you looked amazing out there. Oh, please. No, you did not miss a step. Or should I say "stride?" The only thing missing was that red ribbon you used to wear in your hair. I remember that. ♫ Okay. ♫ Nana's hot apple cider, coming right up. Here. This looks amazing. But remember, we are not done decorating until we go to Finch's and pick out the perfect Christmas tree. It's on the list. Hey, Sam, remember the first time Nana took us there? And we thought all those trees were a Christmas forest? It started snowing, and we were convinced we were gonna actually find a real life reindeer. Uh, is Simon still in the garage getting boxes? Oh, no, uh, I said I was going to go chop some more firewood for later, and he offered to do it. I could help. Um, you know what? I'll ask, and see if he wants some hot apple cider. Hi. Hey. I, um, brought you some cider. It's good. How long have you been thinking about proposing? Since Christmas Eve last year. That's… that's the first time we met. Sam, if it's a question of a little more time, I can give you that. How much time do you need? I don't know. Look, why can't we go back to the way things were just a few days ago? You said you were happy with the way things are. I, uh, I told Jack that I would do this Christmas story for him. So I'm gonna finish it up. Then I think it's best if I leave. I, I'll go spend Christmas with my family, and we can talk when we both get back to the city. Really? I think that's best. I'm sorry. I'm gonna finish up here. I'll be in in a sec. Okay. ♫ Hey! How's the Christmas book coming? Not great. Not great, why? What's wrong? I think Simon may have broken up with me last night. What?! Oh, my gosh, Sam, I'm so sorry. 'Kay, wait, wait. Woah. Why would he do that? I might have told him that I didn't know if I was ready to get married yet. Yep, that would probably do it. Amy, what is wrong with me? Nothing is wrong with you. Hey. I know you. You're just worried about getting hurt again. Look at what happened with Paul. I know the breakup with Paul hurt you, but Simon is not Paul. A mom and dad? Yeah. I love him, and I want to be ready. I just don't know if Simon is willing to wait for that day to come. Yeah. Please don't tell everyone else. Of course, no. I would never. Thank you. You're welcome. Tell everyone else… Uh, that we were gonna start without you to make gingerbread men? Sam's really impatient. Yeah. ♫ ♫ Your grandmother used to make THE best gingerbread cookies I have ever tasted. Yeah, but she would never tell us the recipe. She always just said it's a family secret. Did she ever tell you, dad? Oh, are you kidding? I wasn't even allowed in the kitchen when she was baking. I used to always stick my fingers in the batter, and take it, and… She always made enough for you to take cookies to the station house every Christmas. That is true. I was always very popular at the holidays. See, Sam? That's what you need to put in your book. What book? It's… nothing. Ohh. Sam had a meeting with her publisher this week, and they want her to do another book for them. Doesn't sound like nothing. Sweetheart, that's wonderful. Well, I'm just getting started, so… Congratulations, kiddo! What's it about? Uh, it's a Christmas romance. Oh! That's gonna write itself! I'll bet these last few days have been very enlightening. Oh, you have no idea. Speaking of which, where is that young man of yours? He's on the phone with his boss. They gave him a Christmas story to do while he's here. Oh, you didn't say anything about that. What kind of story? Heartwarming and home for the holidays. It's my favourite kind. Simon! Pull up a chair and get yourself a gingerbread man. Uh, I would love to, but I've gotta go do some work on the story. Oh. Come on. It's fun, AND it's one of our family traditions. Um… Okay. Yeah, I guess I, uh, can stick around for a minute or two. I'll get you a paper. You know, you never said, Simon. Were your parents excited? Uh, about my story? No, silly, about you and Sam getting engaged. Oh, uh, right. That. Um. You know, I haven't told them yet. You haven't? I… Well, let's give them a call right now. That's a great idea. Or… or better yet, we could do a video call, and then we could all be a part of it. Yes! I can't. Why not? Um. Uh. My, uh… my, my parents are spending Christmas out at my Aunt Linda's, and the reception at her place is not the best. So, otherwise I would have told them right away, of course. Oh, that's too bad. I'm sure you're eager to share. I am, I am. I'm, uh, I'm very eager. Yeah. Can I have the sprinkles? Yes, yes.

Go ahead. Oh! Oh! Would you look at that. Samantha was so proud when she brought this home from school. So proud. Look what I found. Oh! It's the family Santa album! Oh my gosh, that is going way back. So far back! Santa album? Oh yes, it's one of our family traditions, and it's on Nana's list. Oh-ho-ho-ho! No! Hello. Look at that hair! What? You don't love the beautiful home perm that I gave myself? We used to go for breakfast at Benjamin's Diner, and then the entire family wod go for a Santa photo. Woah. Look at the big smiles on those two! Mom clearly had a thing for a man in uniform. Someone called in sick and your father pulled a double shift, and we didn't see much of him that Christmas. I was just happy to make it there for the picture. Me too. Aww. All right guys. Let's finish up this tree. Uh, I don't know, kiddo. I think we're pretty good! Yeah, looks good to me. No, we haven't put up Nana's star. Oh! Oh. Uh, you know what? I don't remember seeing that. It's not in any of these boxes. Well, I'm gonna go take a look. It's gotta be somewhere. Uh, Simon? Maybe you want to see if she needs a little help? Oh. Yeah. I'm gonna go see if she needs a hand. Okay great. Where did you put it? Hey. Any luck? Hey. You didn't have to come and help. Seemed like the right thing to do for a fiancé. Right. Thanks. Well, it could be anywhere. Why wouldn't she just leave it with the rest of the Christmas ornaments? Maybe because it is so special? Yeah? How so? Well, ever since I was a little kid, my Nana and I had this tradition where she would let me put the Christmas star on top of the tree. And then we would sit together, and she would tell me one of her stories. Hmm. Does sound like a special star. Yes, it is. And we can't finish the Christmas list without it. Uh-oh. What? It's my parents. Oh. Hi mom! Hi honey. Merry Christmas! How are you doing? I'm good. I'm good. Uh, did you and dad make it to Aunt Linda's okay? Oh, sure. The weather held off. We made it no problem. Your dad just stepped out for a minute. But, I've just seen your email. You saw my email? You've got me sitting on the edge of my seat, what's the big news? Right, uh, the big news. Um… The big news. Uh… Hi Laurie, it's Sam. Hi, Sam! Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you too. Um, Simon is… is way too modest to tell you, so… I will. The station gave him a Christmas Eve story and it's kind of a big deal and a great opportunity. Surprise! Oh, that's great. That's so great, Sam. You know what they say about the first Christmas together? It's always the most special. It is. It… it… it really is. You know, I've never seen him happier than when he's with you. Merry Christmas, Samantha. Merry Christmas to you, too. Bye. You okay? Yeah. Well, that… that was impressive. Hey, you two! Better get back in here before the eggnog's gone! Shall we? Yeah. I think I'm gonna turn in. Are you sure? Yeah, it's kind of a long day, and it's getting late. Um… We usually have a little party after we decorate the tree. Yeah. I'd love for you to stay. Besides, it'll be fun. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Hey! Did you find it? No, but it has to be somewhere. Oh, we'll find it sweetheart. Okay. Oh, Simon, come and see. Uh, this is a picture of Sam when she was 14, and she and Annie decided to dress up as elves and hand out gifts. That hair is definitely better. Those elf costumes! They were cute. They were cute. Thank you. That's… that's somethin', all right. Yeah, it is. Aw. This is my favourite. Yeah. Oh. Morning. Oh, um… Good morning. Busy as ever? Ah, just a couple of last minute things before my assistant closes up the office for the holidays. Yeah. Funny how we used to talk about how busy we both were when the girls were growing up, running here and there. How we couldn't wait for things to slow down so we could have a little time to ourselves? Yeah. Guess that didn't play out quite the way we expected. No. It did not. Well I, uh, better get changed. Remember we're going down to the diner for breakfast and the Santa photo this morning? Yeah. Ready when you are. Remember the first time we went for that photo together? Your mom was so kind to me. So welcoming. She loved you like you were her own daughter. I know she did. But, um. Thank you. Yeah. See you soon. Yeah. ♪ O Christmas tree, ♪ ♪ O, Christmas tree ♪ ♪ Your leaves ♪ ♪ are so unchanging ♪ ♪ O, Christmas tree, ♪ ♪ O, Christmas tree ♪ Hey, Murphy family, I believe you're next. Great! Oh, perfect. Another Murphy family tradition. Hey, look who's here. Simon! Hey. I thought you got stuck in a meeting. Uh, I did. But I, uh, finished it early. Didn't want to miss seeing you take your family Santa photo. Aww! Well, the important thing is, you made it here for the picture. Excuse me. We're next, Santa. All right. Simon, come on. Everybody, squeeze in. Let's make some room for Simon. Oh… Uh, I think it's best if I just… Oh, no, no, no. You get in here beside your bride-to-be. Bill, I… This is a family photo and you're going to be a part of this family very soon. Let's go. You heard my dad. Come on. Okay. 'Tis the season. Okay. On three, "Merry Christmas." One, two, three… Merry Christmas! Hey, kiddo. Hey. Did you enjoy your walk? Just wanted to clear my head so I could try and get some writing done. A lot going on right now. No kidding. You want some company? You bet. Ah, it's cold. You okay? I was just walking around and looking at all the Christmas decorations and the lights, and thinking about how much I love Christmas here, in this town, in this house. Yeah, it's always been a pretty special place. You'd think it'd inspire me to write something. Aw, sweetie. You just have to be patient. Ugh. You never know when the inspiration is gonna hit you. We're almost done with the list. Yeah. You know what, it's been fun, checking all the items off the list like we used to. Christmas is almost here. Almost. I am really going to miss this house, dad. Well, we will always have our memories to treasure. And her Christmas stories. They were so great. Yep. I would not be a writer if it weren't for her. I just… I wish I could find a way to keep her and her stories alive forever. What's stopping you? She's always going to be with you. With all of us. And you're always going to have her stories. They're not going away. And hey, aren't you writers all supposed to have a muse? Hmm! Hmmm. Hmmm. Hmm. Yes! Yes we are. Thanks, dad. Oh, don't thank me, kiddo. It's my job. Oh, I love you. I love you, sweetie. Morning! Hey, good morning. Where are you off to? It's barely light out. We're shooting my story today. Oh! Yeah. You know, I don't even know what your story's about. Well, you should come see for yourself. It's about a couple from around here. Really? Yeah. I'd love to. Great. Oh, um. Give me five minutes. Okay. I mean, you can wear that. Five minutes! All right. Let's do this. Oh, my dear, it's Samantha Murphy! - Irene! - It's been years! Yes, it has! Oh, Sam, this is Charlie. Hi! Hi. Pleasure to meet you. Sam! Nice to meet you. And I still think you have your grandmother's eyes. Aw, thank you. I've been told that before. I have to say, Samantha, you could have knocked me over with a feather when Charlie told me a TV station from New York City wanted to do a story on us? And getting interviewed by your fiancé? She said "why on earth would anybody want to interview us" when, you know, it's not like we're famous or anybody important. Well, I think your story is very important, so let's tell it. Are you ready? Ready. Okay. Let's do it. And what else I find fascinating is that your anniversary is on Christmas day. Yes, it is. Now how long have you two been married? One fabulous year. One year. Though, we did fall in love almost 40 years ago, when we met at the top of the Empire State Building while taking photos. We just never had the good sense to do anything about it. Well, it was one thing or another. We kept telling ourselves it wasn't the right time, or we weren't ready, or maybe we should wait a while longer. Until finally, one day we woke up, it was like we'd lost track of each other. Before we knew it, I got a job offer overseas, and, uh, Irene wanted to move back home to Cedar Ridge. So, off I went. And I came back here. We lost touch. And it took you almost 40 years to find each other again? Mm-hmm. You know, we do regret all the time we lost. But, uh, we got married right away and, uh, bought this lovely home. And we couldn't be happier. Well, I'm happy for the both of you. Thanks, that was… that was really wonderful. Thank you. That was really, really wonderful. Thanks a lot. All right. So. What'd you think? I thought it was great. I'm really proud of you. Thank you. Um, I gotta wrap a couple things up, so it might be a minute. Okay, well, I think I'm gonna walk home. I just wanna get some work done on the book. You sure you don't want me to give you a ride? No, I'm fine. I could, um, use the fresh air. Okay. Um… I'll see you back at the house. Okay. It was a great piece. ♪ O come, all ye faithful ♪ ♪ Joyful and triumphant ♪ Bill, have you seen Annie? Bill. Didn't you hear me? Oh, sorry. I said I was looking for Annie. Yeah. She went into town to pick something up for dinner. Ah. Is everything all right? Just got an email from the realtor. Looks like we're good to go. So, that's it, then? I guess so. Do you ever, uh, think back, Claire, and… ask yourself what happened between us? Oh, Bill… I… I… I know. Six years, I'm dragging some old baggage out here. But, I do. I… I think about it sometimes, and for the life of me, I cannot remember what happened. I mean, what really happened. We just drifted apart. The girls moved out, you kept busy with the force, I wanted to advance my law career. It just… happened. It's no one's fault. Not much of a reason, is it? Not after building a life together for all those years like we did. No. It's not. We were happy, though. For a long time, weren't we, Claire? Yes, Bill, we were very happy. Spending Christmas here, together, in this house? I think that had a lot to do with it. I think your mother knew that. Hmm. Yeah, I think she did. ♫ - Hey. - Hey. You finished up late. I had to jump right in to the edit, and it took forever. Oh, Irene wanted you to have some scones. Ohhh… That's so nice. Yeah. I'm actually starving. Making any progress? No. Maybe you just need some rest. It's like I can feel the words, you know? I can feel them on the tip of my tongue, but I just… I can't get them out. Well, it's after midnight. You know what that means? I do not know what that means. It is officially Christmas Eve day. And in my family, we have a very old tradition. Mm! You each get a present. Stay right there. Hmmm… Madam! I promise you it is not a sweater. Oh! I know that nothing can replace this house and all the Christmas memories that it holds, but maybe there's just enough Christmas spirit in that little house to help you find the story you want to write. Wow. Thank you. You're welcome. I love it. Wait here. Where are you going? Don't worry about it. Now, it's your turn. My turn? Didn't you say you each get a present? I did, I did. Yeah. I promise it's not a sweater. It's the night that we met. Yeah. We had that couple from Ohio take the picture. Yeah. We were both stuck in the city for work. I walked down to Rockefeller Centre, and there you were, sitting on a bench, hot apple cider in hand, staring up at that tree. And you sat down next to me. And do you remember what you said? Yeah, I do. How could I forget? "Come here often?" So bad! So bad. And I said "about once a year." We stayed there for hours, just talking and laughing. I knew that night that one day, I would marry you. Uh… I'll let you get back to work. Okay. Good night. Night. ♫ ♫ You never did get the hang of that. All thumbs. It is up, and then through. There. What? You… look beautiful. Thank you. Uh, I decided that I'm not going to sell. Really? Yeah. I love this house too much to let it go. Yeah, maybe it's starting to show its age a little, and it's got some work to do, but I'm retired, so… I got plenty of time. I think the girls would really like it if I held onto it, so… And who knows, maybe we could, you know, have some more Christmases here together, or come… I love this house too. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Oh, well, maybe you want to, uh, I don't know, think about, uh, coming back for a… a visit sometime soon? I might. Um. You know, I forgot my purse. I'm going to go get that. Gotta get that. Oh, of course. Yeah. Okay. Definitely have eaten my fill of gingerbread cookies. Samantha and I are having a great time. Yeah, I miss you too, dad. Okay. Yeah, will do. All right. Merry Christmas. Hi. Bye-bye. Hey. All set? Yeah, I think so. I was just talking to my folks. They say hi. You look nice. I was, um, I was just thinking the same thing about you. Come on, everybody.

And maybe it's time to get over that fear here with me. I will always be here for you. Samantha. I forgot to tell you. I told your dad the idea of a Christmas wedding, and he agrees. What about a Christmas wedding? For Samantha and Simon, of course. A year-long engagement, that's just the right amount of time. Mom, we have tons of time to talk about that much later. No, I think your folks are right. I mean, a lot of couples order flowers at least a year in advance. Mark? Uh-nuh. Have you guys thought about where you might wanna get married? No, dad, we haven't. Simon, you are awfully quiet. What about you? Where do you want to get married? Um… You know, we haven't, uh, we haven't really talked about it yet. We haven't had time. Well, you know what they say. No time like the present. I can't do this anymore, Sam. Okay, no. I know. I know. I'm going to go tell themrino No. It's not about that. You're not ready for this. And I, uh, I don't know what to do to change that for you. You've got to write the ending to this story yourself. And in the meantime, I think it's best if I just go. Simon… I'm sorry, Sam. I'm sorry. We can just talk when we're both back in the city, okay? Merry Christmas. Samantha? Is everything okay? There is no engagement, mom. There… there's no wedding. We've been pretending this whole time. And, I'm so sorry. Why didn't you just say something? We didn't want to ruin Christmas. Honey. He asked, I said yes, and I panicked. I couldn't stop thinking about Paul breaking off the engagement, and what that did to me. And I… I couldn't stop thinking about you and dad. When we were growing up, you were the happiest. You were the perfect couple. And even with all of that, you just… You couldn't make it work. Oh, sweetheart. Your father and I got a divorce but that does not mean that we regret a moment that we spent together. We have so many wonderful memories. We have two beautiful daughters. Those were the happiest days of our lives. I don't know what the future holds for us, or even if we have a future, but just imagine what we would have missed out on if we didn't even try. Sweetheart. Sometimes you just gotta take a leap of faith. If you love him the rest will work itself out. Oh, honey. Thank you, mom. Simon loves you very much. Hmm? I know. Annie, Mark. I need your keys. Well, wait, what's going on? Where… where's Simon? It's a really long story, but… I made a mistake, and I have to fix it. Go get him, Sam. It's me. I know I'm the last person you want to talk to right now, but I'm on my way to the house. Please, wait for me! Come on. Come on, come on, come on, come on… Simon? Simon! Simon! Got your message. You came back. Of course I came back. Look. I know that there are going to be moments when we disagree. I know there are going to be times that are tough. I know the road isn't always going to be perfect, but I know that I love you. And there is no one that I would rather be married to than you. I want to make sure that you're not just… caught up in the emotion of being at this house with your family on Christmas. Are you ready to get married… to me? Would you ask me again? I mean, unless… unless you've changed your mind. Samantha, I love you. I want to spend every Christmas for the rest of my life with you. Will you marry me? Yes. Yes! Come on, Sam. We're opening presents! Be right there! Thank you. And this one is for you, Sam. Thank you, dad. Oh, it's not from me. Oh. It's from Nana. There's one for each of you girls. Bringing us all back together again. That was her real gift. You go first, mom. Okay. Oh! What did you get, mom? I love it. It's our last Christmas. Oh! I love it! It's beautiful! Okay, my turn. Just like when we were kids. It's her old recipe book. That's great. Ooh, wow. Wait, and she marked it… Oh! Gingerbread men! It's her gingerbread recipe! I want that recipe. Yes, of course. Oh my gosh. Okay, dad. What did you get? Open yours. Okay. She must have known that I would never have the heart to sell this place. Aww. Yeah. Aww. Well, what did you get Sam? Let's see. Yeah. Oh! It's the Christmas Star. There it is. Of course It's perfect! Oh, it's a card. Let's see. "Traditions are the stories that families write together. "Keep writing our story." I think there's one tradition left to do, of course. Yes. Can you help me? Yes. Thank you, Nana. For everything. And the list is complete. Yep. The list is complete. So, what do you say, folks? Same time next year? I will bring the gingerbread. I wouldn't miss it. I'm in. How would you guys feel about a Christmas wedding? Oh! Yes! Really? What? Yes! Of course! Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas my loves. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.
