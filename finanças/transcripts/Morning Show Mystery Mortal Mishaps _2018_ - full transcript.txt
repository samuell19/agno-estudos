OOH! IT'S CALLED "CELEBRATION CAKE." OOH, I CAN SEE WHY. AH, NO TOUCHING UNTIL IT COOLS BECAUSE WE WANT IT... TO TURN OUT LIKE THIS. OH, THAT IS A BEAUTY. PHIL, GET A SHOT OF THAT. MY DAD SAID IT BROUGHT GOOD LUCK. HE USED TO BAKE IT FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS... WEDDINGS, BIRTHDAYS, GRADUATIONS, AND SOME MORNINGS, I WOULD JUST WAKE UP, AND I WOULD SEE THE CAKE ON THE KITCHEN TABLE, WHICH MEANT WE WOULD SKIP WORK AND SCHOOL AND JUST CELEBRATE LIFE. WELL, I BET YOU WISH YOU HAD A DAD LIKE THAT. ONE LUCKY AUDIENCE MEMBER IS GOING HOME WITH THIS CAKE TODAY. YOU ALL SENT IN SOME AMAZING CELEBRATION STORIES, HOPING TO WIN, BUT WE DECIDED WE ARE GOING TO GIVE THE CAKE TO... MELISSA AND JACK, FROM BAINBRIDGE ISLAND. THEY JUST HAD TWINS. CONGRATULATIONS, MELISSA AND JACK. BILLIE? WHO GETS THE OTHER CAKE? WE DO, BECAUSE WE'RE ABOUT TO START A NEW CHAPTER OF WAKE UP, WEST COAST! NOW, AS MOST OF YOU KNOW, WE LOST OUR BELOVED CO-HOST, LANIE HAYWOOD, THREE MONTHS AGO, AFTER A TRAGIC REACTION TO HAZELNUT COFFEE. REMEMBER, FOOD ALLERGIES ARE NO JOKE. LANIE WAS BY MY SIDE FOR 10 YEARS, WAKING US UP WITH A SMILE AND A STORY. LETTING HER GO HAS NOT BEEN EASY, BUT THANKS TO YOU, OUR LOYAL VIEWERS, AND BILLIE BLESSINGS, OUR RESIDENT FOOD EXPERT, WE'RE STILL GOING STRONG. IN FACT, I THINK WE'RE STRONGER THAN EVER. YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHAT MAKES OUR SHOW SPECIAL-- WE'RE A FAMILY, AND FAMILIES TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER. AND TOMORROW, OUR EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, RUDY SLATER... THERE HE IS! RUDY, WAVE! HE'LL BE INTRODUCING OUR NEW CO-HOST. DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHO THAT IS? THEN SET THOSE ALARMS, EVERYBODY, BECAUSE TOMORROW MORNING, YOU'RE GOING FIND OUT! THANK YOU FOR THAT SPECTACULAR CAKE. WELL, DON'T BE AFRAID TO TRY IT AT HOME, AND REMEMBER, YOU CAN'T BUY HAPPINESS, BUT YOU CAN BAKE IT. CHEERS TO THAT. AND WE'RE OFF. WHO IS IN CHARGE OF MY TELEPROMPTER? IT'S TOO SLOW. I CAN'T... YOU KNOW WHAT? WHAT'S EATING LANCE? OH, HE'S JUST MAD BECAUSE HE DOESN'T KNOW WHO THE NEW CO-HOST IS. WELL, NOBODY DOES. LANCE HAS BEEN AROUND THE LONGEST. HE THOUGHT HE SHOULD HAVE A SAY. IF IT WERE UP TO LANCE, HE'D CLONE HIMSELF AND CO-HOST WITH HIS FAVORITE PERSON IN THE WORLD. BE NICE. IT'S YOU, ISN'T IT? I HAVE NO IDEA WHO THE NEW CO-HOST IS. YOU'RE THE ONLY REASON PEOPLE STILL WATCH THIS SHOW, SINCE LANIE DIED. LET'S KEEP IT POSITIVE. I AM POSITIVE. I JUST CALL IT LIKE I SEE IT. WELL, WE'LL ALL FIND OUT LATER ON TONIGHT WHEN RUDY TELLS US AT DINNER. HAVE EITHER OF YOU SEEN ANY OF THE SOUND GUYS? SOMETHING'S GOING WRONG WITH THE EQUIPMENT. GRETCHEN AND RUDY WENT UP TO HIS OFFICE AFTER THE SHOW. RUDY'S HEADSET MUST BE ON. NOBODY CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO TURN IT OFF. YOU ARE NOT HIRING THAT WOMAN. OVER MY DEAD BODY. OH, SOMEBODY MUST HAVE PATCHED THAT. RUDY'S HEADSET SHOULD NEVER COME THROUGH THAT SPEAKER. IT'S SUPPOSED TO GO TO THE CONTROL ROOM. WE SHOULD PROBABLY LET THEM KNOW. I WILL DESTROY THIS SHOW. SO, KIKI... YOU'RE RUDY'S ASSISTANT, RIGHT? I AM NOT GOING IN THERE. BILLIE IS THE ONLY ONE HE ACTUALLY LIKES. WELL, THANKS FOR THAT VOTE OF CONFIDENCE. AHEM. I PROMISE YOU. HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO HEAR THE SAME STORY? I AM SO SICK AND TIRED OF THIS. DO NOT CROSS ME! YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M CAPABLE OF DOING. WHAT IS IT? YOUR MIC IS ON. WE CAN HEAR YOU GUYS IN THE SET. OH, PERFECT. THIS IS GREAT. WHAT JOKER WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT, HUH? DON'T PRETEND LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW. WAS THAT YOUR GOAL WHEN YOU GOT UP THIS MORNING? TO SEE HOW MANY WAYS I CAN HUMILIATE GRETCHEN TODAY? MAYBE YOU WERE THE ONE THAT LEFT THE MIC ON, JUST TO LET EVERYBODY KNOW WHO'S IN CHARGE. I AM IN CHARGE, RUDY. I AM THE PRESIDENT OF PROGRAMMING. YOU DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO HIRE A CO-HOST WITHOUT MY APPROVAL. YOU WORK FOR ME. ACTUALLY, I WORK FOR YOUR FATHER. YOU WENT TO MY FATHER? HE SIGNED THE CONTRACT THIS MORNING. WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST BREAK UP WITH ME? THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN CLEANER. YOU KNOW, YOU WOULD HAVE MADE MY LIFE A WHOLE LOT EASIER IF YOU HAD AGREED TO BE THE CO-HOST WHEN I FIRST ASKED YOU. I TOLD YOU, I HAVE TOO MUCH TO DO. COME ON, WHO DOESN'T WANT TO BE A STAR OF THEIR OWN TELEVISION SHOW? LOOK, I RUN MY OWN RESTAURANT, AND I LIKE TEACHING PEOPLE HOW TO COOK. WELL, GOOD DEEDS MAKE GOOD REFRIGERATOR MAGNETS, AND NOBODY PAYS ANY ATTENTION TO EITHER OF THOSE. ARE WE STILL ON FOR THAT DINNER TONIGHT? YEAH, SURE. WHY WOULDN'T WE BE? SEEMED LIKE IT MIGHT BE CANCELED. MISS BLESSINGS HAS SUGGESTED THAT I UPDATE YOU ON DINNER. SO HERE IT IS. NOW WE ALL KNOW THAT GRETCHEN IS NOT VERY HAPPY ABOUT LANIE'S REPLACEMENT, BUT SOMEONE ELSE HERE IS TRYING TO KEEP ME FROM HIRING A CO-HOST. THAT LITTLE STUNT WITH THE MICROPHONE IS JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG. WHOEVER IS TRYING TO SABOTAGE MY SHOW, WHEN I FIND OUT WHO YOU ARE, YOU'RE FIRED. OKAY THEN. WHY DO I SUDDENLY FEEL LIKE STAYING HOME? YOUR AUNT CALLED WHILE YOU WERE IN RUDY'S OFFICE. YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO MEET HER AT THE FARMER'S MARKET 30 MINUTES AGO. I COMPLETELY FORGOT. YOU LEFT YOUR PHONE IN THE DRESSING ROOM, AND YOUR BAG... OKAY. ALSO YOUR CAR KEYS. DID YOU WANT ME TO TAKE THE CAKE TO THE RESTAURANT FOR YOU? NO, I WANT YOU TO BE MY ASSISTANT INSTEAD OF RUDY'S BECAUSE CLEARLY I HAVE A GREATER NEED. SORRY, I GOT DIBS. SEE YOU LATER. NO? THAT IS A THING OF BEAUTY. THAT'S A HYBRID. HOW MUCH? FOR YOU? $3.00 A POUND. TWO. NOBODY'S GOT TOMATOES LIKE THESE. $2.00, AND I'LL TAKE A BOX. I'M SO SORRY I'M LATE. HEY, GIL. HEY, BILLIE. $2.00. FOR YOU. AND WHAT ELSE? OH, HERE'S A LIST. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING. NO, YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT I'M THINKING. YOU DON'T LIKE THE SHOW, EVERYBODY IN TELEVISION IS SELF-ABSORBED, AND IT'S TAKING ME AWAY FROM THE RESTAURANT. WELL, IT IS TAKING YOU AWAY FROM THE RESTAURANT. AUNT CASSANDRA, WE'VE BEEN STRUGGLING TO KEEP THIS RESTAURANT OPEN FOR 12 YEARS. IN THE THREE YEARS SINCE I'VE BEEN ON THE SHOW, WE HAVE WAIT LISTS. NO, WE HAVE WAIT LISTS 'CAUSE YOU WROTE A COOKBOOK. YES, WHICH I GET TO SHARE EVERY MORNING. I THINK IT HELPS PEOPLE. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU WENT ON A DATE? HOW DID WE GET FROM "I'M SORRY I'M LATE," TO DATES? LOOK, I KNOW THE SHOW'S GOOD FOR THE RESTAURANT. I JUST DON'T THINK THAT RUDY APPRECIATES YOU. RUDY IS MY FRIEND. HE BROUGHT ME ON BECAUSE HE BELIEVES IN THE BOOK. HE CARES ABOUT THE MESSAGE. RUDY CARES ABOUT HIMSELF. TV PEOPLE JUST WANT TO BE FAMOUS. OH, YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THEM. ARE THOSE TURNIPS? OH, YEAH, MAURICE HAD A DREAM LAST NIGHT. HE WAS STANDING IN A FIELD OF TURNIPS. AUNT CASSANDRA, NOBODY LIKES TURNIPS. THEY TASTE LIKE MEDICINE. YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S LIKE WHEN HE GETS UPSET. WHY IS MAURICE UPSET? HE THINKS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO CLOSE THE RESTAURANT. WHAT? THAT'S WHAT HE SAID THIS MORNING. HE THINKS THAT RUDY'S GOING TO MAKE YOU CO-HOST AND THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SELL. I AM NOT SELLING THE RESTAURANT, AND I TOLD RUDY, I DON'T EVEN WANT TO BE THE CO-HOST. WELL, DON'T LOOK AT ME. I'M NOT THE ONE COOKING TURNIPS. UGH. TA-DAH! HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON? MAURICE INVENTED A NEW RECIPE. IT CAME TO ME IN A DREAM. JUAN AND KIKI ARE HELPING ME TEST. THIS MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST NIGHT TO TRY A NEW RECIPE. WE'RE COMPLETELY BOOKED. PLUS, REMEMBER? IT'S RUDY'S DINNER. WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT ABOUT THE CO-HOST? JUST TASTE. CHEF INCREDIBLE IS MAKING MAGIC. YOU HATE IT. "HATE" IS A STRONG WORD. IT WAS A LITTLE BITTER. I'M JUST A BARTENDER. I DON'T NORMALLY EAT VEGETABLES. FEATHERS, BUDDY, HOW YOU DOING? YOU STAY. YOU STAY. THAT'S A GOOD DOG. YEAH, THAT'S MY BABY. OH! OH... OH! HMM. OH. FEATHERS MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST JUDGE, MAURICE. JUST NEEDS A LITTLE WORK, THAT'S ALL. MAURICE, YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS RESTAURANT, RIGHT? SURE. WELL, THIS HAS BEEN A STRESSFUL PERIOD, BUT I PROMISE, AFTER TONIGHT, EVERYTHING IS GOING TO GO BACK TO NORMAL, OKAY? OKAY. THAT'S A GOOD BOY. THAT'S A GOOD BOY. AFTERNOON, MR. SLATER. YOU HAVE A PACKAGE. OH, YEAH? WHAT IS IT. LOOKS LIKE A CAKE. HUH. YOU'RE WELCOME. HEY, IT'S ME. I'VE GOT THE CONTRACT. EVERYTHING LOOKS GREAT. SHE WAS A LITTLE UPSET. YOU KNOW WHAT SHE CAN BE LIKE, BUT DON'T WORRY, EVERYTHING IS UNDER CONTROL. WELL, WHY DON'T WE SAY... HALF AN HOUR FROM NOW? OKAY... AND LISTEN... EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE GREAT, HUH? OKAY. BYE. MM. UM... I DECIDED NOT TO SERVE THE TURNIPS TONIGHT, BUT I'M NOT GIVING UP. BLESSINGS IN THE KITCHEN, CHAPTER ONE, "ALL GREAT CHEFS TAKE WHISKS." YOU KNOW THAT'S A TERRIBLE PUN. HASN'T STOPPED PEOPLE FROM BUYING COOKBOOKS, THOUGH. YEAH. DID RUDY GET HERE YET? NO, AND HIS ASSISTANT, SHE'S PRETTY PANICKED EVEN FOR HER. HER NAME'S KIKI. YOU SEE HER THREE TIMES A WEEK. OH, AND HIS FIANCEE ISN'T HERE YET EITHER. YOU KNOW, THE... THE FUN ONE. THEY HAD A BIG FIGHT THIS MORNING. YEAH, WHY AM I NOT SURPRISED? TABLE TWO, AND NO SCALOPPINI TONIGHT. OH, BOY. THAT'S THE HEAD OF THE NETWORK. WHAT AM I GOING TO TELL HIM ABOUT RUDY? BILLIE BLESSINGS. MY FAVORITE CHEF. I'M SO GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT. MAKE IT? I'VE BEEN WAITING THREE MONTHS FOR RUDY TO PICK A NEW CO-HOST. LET'S GET IT OVER WITH! AND WHO IS THIS? THIS IS MY AUNT, CASSANDRA SHAW. AUNT CASSANDRA, THIS IS VERNON DIVOSS. OH, BILLIE. YOU DIDN'T TELL ME YOU WERE RELATED TO THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN THE WORLD. DOES THAT LINE USUALLY WORK FOR YOU? A STRAIGHT-SHOOTER, JUST LIKE YOUR NIECE. I HOPE YOU'RE PROUD OF HER. SHE'S THE BEST PART OF THE SHOW. WHY DON'T WE JUST GO ON IN? WE'LL TALK. HMM! TV PEOPLE. WELL, WHERE THE HECK IS RUDY? TOO IMPORTANT TO SHOW UP AT HIS OWN DINNER? WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A SEAT? THANK YOU. - HAVE YOU HEARD FROM HIM? - NO. WHY ISN'T HE HERE? I'VE TRIED ALL HIS NUMBERS. DO YOU THINK GRETCHEN CANCELED THE SHOW? NO, SHE CAN'T DO THAT WITHOUT HER FATHER'S CONSENT. FINALLY. OH, HEY, EVERYBODY. HEY, SORRY I'M LATE. I, UH... HAD A LITTLE TROUBLE DRIVING MY CAR. ACTUALLY, BETWEEN YOU AND ME, I HAD A BIT OF TROUBLE FINDING MY CAR. WHEN I BOUGHT THIS CHANNEL, I HAD A DREAM. RUDY SLATER MADE THAT DREAM COME TRUE, BY PRODUCING A SHOW THAT BROUGHT US NATIONAL ATTENTION. LET'S HOPE OUR NEW CO-HOST CAN MAKE US EVEN BIGGER. RUDY. THANK YOU, VERNON. UM... THIS AFTERNOON, DESPITE MANY ATTEMPTS TO KEEP IT FROM HAPPENING, A NEW CO-HOST SIGNED A CONTRACT TO JOIN WAKE UP WEST COAST. NOW, WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT, SHE'S A PART OF OUR FAMILY NOW, AND IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON. MM? STARTING TONIGHT, OUR SHOW IS ON A NEW PATH. RUDY? YOU OKAY? IT'S OKAY. TAKE IT EASY! SOMEBODY CALL 911! TAKE IT EASY. IS HE REALLY DEAD? I'D SAY THAT'S AFFIRMATIVE. OH, HE SEEMED SO HEALTHY. GUYS LIKE THAT, MAN, HARD DRIVING... SOMETIMES, THEY JUST DROP. BILLIE BLESSINGS? YOU OWN THIS RESTAURANT? YES. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CLOSE. CLOSE? WE NEED TO SEARCH THE PREMISES. BUT WE'RE STILL SERVING DINNER. THE EMTs DID A PRELIMINARY TOX SCREEN. IT APPEARS THAT RUDY SLATER WAS POISONED. CYANIDE. I'M HAPPY TO MAKE THE ANNOUNCEMENT MYSELF, BUT IT MIGHT BE LESS UPSETTING COMING FROM YOU. SO VERY SORRY ABOUT THIS. YOU COME BACK ANY TIME. DINNER WILL BE ON US, AND DON'T YOU WORRY. EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE FINE. OKAY? WE'RE HOLDING THE STAFF AND THE PEOPLE FROM THE PRIVATE PARTY, EXCEPT THE GUY WHO OWNS THE NETWORK. WE ALREADY QUESTIONED HIM. BILLIE BLESSINGS! MY WIFE LOVES HER. GOT ALL THESE QUOTES UP ON THE FRIDGE. "STIR UP YOUR COURAGE." "BAKE A FRIEND." I'LL INTERVIEW HER. WHAT, YOU GOT A CELEBRITY CRUSH? IT'S A LONG LIST. WHY DON'T YOU GET STARTED? SOMEONE LOST HIS SENSE OF HUMOR. THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS. THEY CANNOT KEEP US HERE ALL NIGHT. I NEED MY SLEEP. CLEARLY, THE MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEM WE FACE RIGHT NOW. WELL, SOME OF US HAVE TO DO A SHOW TOMORROW, PHILLIP. THERE MIGHT NOT BE A SHOW TOMORROW. I STILL CAN'T REACH GRETCHEN. SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING. IAN? HEY, BILLIE. IS THERE SOME PLACE WE CAN TALK? SURE. FOLLOW ME. MY OFFICE IS UPSTAIRS. I GUESS THEY KNOW EACH OTHER. MM. HER FATHER WAS A COP BEFORE HE OPENED THE RESTAURANT. IAN... WAS HIS PARTNER. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. WE SHOULD FIND BETTER WAYS TO MEET. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME? THE NIGHT WE OPENED. RIGHT. WE WERE ALL SURPRISED. EDDIE BLESSINGS, STARTING A RESTAURANT. IT WAS REALLY THE ONLY THING ON HIS BUCKET LIST AFTER HE RETIRED. YOU STILL SEEING THAT GUY? THE FUTURE SENATOR? NOT FOR A WHILE. OH. I SEE YOU ON THAT MORNING SHOW SOMETIMES. YOU'RE GOOD. HOW'S YOUR WIFE? EX-WIFE. OH, I'M SORRY. NO, IT'S OKAY. WE HAVE A GREAT KID. EMMA. EIGHT YEARS OLD. SHE ALREADY READS FASTER THAN I DO. IS THIS AWKWARD? NO. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE EASIER TO TALK TO ME THAN SOME STRANGER. DO YOU REALLY THINK RUDY WAS MURDERED? WELL, IT'S HARD TO GET CYANIDE POISONING BY ACCIDENT. CYANIDE. IT USUALLY GETS MISSED. LOOKS LIKE A HEART ATTACK, ANAPHYLAXIS. ONE OF THE EMTs SMELLED ALMONDS. MOST PEOPLE CAN'T SMELL CYANIDE, GENETICALLY. IN A WAY, YOUR FRIEND'S LUCKY. AT LEAST WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. NOW WE CAN FIND HIS KILLER. RUDY SLATER, WHO DROPPED DEAD AT BLESSINGS' KITC A POPULAR BISTRO OWNED BY THE COOKING EXPERT ON HIS AWARD-WINNING MORNING SHOW. THE RESTAURANT WAS CLOSED BY POLICE IN A BIZARRE CASE OF FOOD POISONING THAT COULD BE MURDER. HI, BABY! LOOK WHAT I GOT! YOU USED TO DO THIS FOR ME ALL THE TIME WHEN I COULDN'T SLEEP. WELL, TONIGHT, I'M DOING IT FOR ME, AND IF YOU'RE NICE, I MIGHT SHARE. SO WHAT DID IAN SAY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED? DO THEY HAVE ANY SUSPECTS? I DON'T THINK SO. HE ASKED IF I KNEW ANYBODY WHO WOULD WANT TO KILL RUDY. IT'S HARD TO THINK OF SOMEONE WHO DIDN'T WANT TO KILL RUDY. AUNT CASSANDRA. I KNOW YOU LOVED HIM, BUT THE MAN WAS MURDERED. SO, WHAT WAS IT LIKE? SEEING IAN AGAIN? WHY? DON'T YOU "WHY" ME. YOU GUYS WERE HIGH SCHOOL SWEETHEARTS. YOU WENT TO PROM TOGETHER. PROM WAS YEARS AGO, AND SOME OF US HAVE MOVED ON. OH, PLEASE. REMEMBER WHEN WE OPENED THE RESTAURANT, AND HE BROUGHT THAT GIRLFRIEND OF HIS? I SAW THE WAY YOU GUYS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER. IT TOOK EVERYTHING I HAD NOT TO TELL HIM HE WAS MAKING THE BIGGEST MISTAKE OF HIS LIFE. FIRST OF ALL, I WAS ENGAGED, AND HE ENDED UP MARRYING THAT GIRLFRIEND. AND HOW DID THAT WORK OUT FOR BOTH OF YOU? I HOPE YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO FIX US UP. OH, HONEY, IF I WAS TRYING TO FIX YOU UP, I'D JUST COME RIGHT OUT AND SAY IT. YOU KNOW, RUDY NEVER SAID WHO THE NEW CO-HOST WAS. SHE'S SUPPOSED TO START TOMORROW. WELL, MAYBE THEY'LL CANCEL THE SHOW. WELL, I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW WE ARE STILL GOING ON. I SUGGESTED WE CANCEL, BUT DOES ANYONE EVER LISTEN TO ME? NO, I'VE GOT ONE. GRETCHEN SAYS WE HAVEN'T CANCELED IN 25 YEARS, AND NOW SHE'S OUR NEW EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, WHICH IS LIKE STRIKING A MATCH IN A ROOM FULL OF GASOLINE, AND DO YOU KNOW WHO RUDY HIRED TO BE MY NEW CO-HOST? A LITTLE FLY SPECK HE FOUND ON SOME COMMUNITY TV STATION IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. COMPLETE AMATEUR. ZERO EXPERIENCE. I'M SURE HE HAD A REASON. DO NOT CHANGE THE SUBJECT. THE MINUTE SHE GOT HERE, SHE LOCKED HERSELF IN HER DRESSING ROOM. SHE IS NOT COMING OUT, WHICH IS PERFECT, BECAUSE WE GO LIVE IN 30 MINUTES, PEOPLE! DID ANYBODY TRY TO TALK TO HER? MAYBE YOU HAVEN'T BEEN LISTENING TO WHAT I'VE BEEN SAYING. THIS WHOLE SHOW IS GOING UP IN FLAMES. POOF! TIFFANY? IT'S BILLIE BLESSINGS. I'D LOVE TO SAY HI. I'M SO GLAD TO FINALLY MEET YOU. I CAN'T GO OUT THERE. I TOLD RUDY I DON'T DO LIVE TELEVISION. NO, MY STYLE SHOW WAS PRERECORDED. WHAT IF I MAKE A MISTAKE? RUDY SAID THAT HE'D HELP ME, BUT NOW HE'S GONE. HE KNEW YOU COULD DO THIS. THAT'S WHY HE HIRED YOU. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. I GET STAGE FRIGHT. I FREEZE RIGHT UP. I FELT EXACTLY THE SAME WAY WHEN I STARTED. YOU DID? I TOLD RUDY I WOULD FAINT. KNOW WHAT HE SAID? "PEOPLE LOVE SURPRISES." HE GAVE ME A GREAT TIP. HE TOLD ME IF SOMEONE ASKS YOU A QUESTION YOU DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER, REPEAT IT BACK. SO YOU HAVE TIME TO THINK. THAT'S A GREAT IDEA. WHY DON'T I GO GET MAKEUP? RUDY SAID THAT YOU WERE THE NICEST PERSON THAT HE'S EVER MET. HE WAS RIGHT. YOU CAN DO THIS. GRETCHEN, IT'S BILLIE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? GRETCHEN! ARE YOU OKAY? WHY ARE YOU IN HERE? I WAS JUST... I DON'T KNOW. I WAS JUST TRYING TO WRAP MY MIND AROUND WHAT HAPPENED. DIDN'T YOU GET THE MESSAGE? I TOLD KIKI TO CALL YOU LAST NIGHT. MY PHONE WAS TURNED OFF. I'VE CANCELED THE COOKING SEGMENT. CANCELED? WHY? I'M TAKING YOU OFF THE SHOW. YOU'RE FIRING ME? LOOK, I DON'T THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR YOU TO BE HERE, UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. GRETCHEN, RUDY DIED AT MY RESTAURANT, BUT I DIDN'T KILL HIM. DON'T MAKE ME PLAY YOUR LITTLE GAMES. I HAVE ENOUGH ON MY PLATE. IF YOU NEED EXPLANATIONS, I SUGGEST YOU TALK TO THE POLICE. YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM. THEY'LL THINK SHE DID IT. WELL THEN, YOU NEED TO TELL BILLIE. I CAN'T. TELL BILLIE WHAT? UH... THE POLICE LEFT, AND THE KITCHEN IS CLEAN. TELL HER, OR I'LL TELL HER MYSELF. EXCUSE ME. CAN I COME IN? WELL, I HOPE THIS MEANS WE CAN OPEN BACK UP. I NEED TO SPEAK TO MAURICE. MAURICE? WHY? THERE WAS A CAKE AT RUDY'S APARTMENT THAT TESTED POSITIVE FOR CYANIDE. IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN THE CAKE. RUDY DROVE TO THE RESTAURANT. THAT WOULD TAKE AT LEAST 40 MINUTES. CYANIDE KILLS PEOPLE IN SECONDS. UNLESS IT'S BAKED. IT COMBINES WITH THE SUGAR. IT CAN TAKE HOURS TO BREAK DOWN. WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? DID YOU DELIVER A CAKE TO RUDY'S BUILDING YESTERDAY? YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING. I DID. WHAT? I'M PLACING YOU UNDER ARREST FOR THE MURDER OF RUDY SLATER. THEY KNEW MY FATHER. I REMINDED THEM THAT YOU'RE ALLOWED TO SEE VISITORS BEFORE THEY TAKE YOU DOWN TO BOOKING. MAURICE... WHAT IS HAPPENING? WHY DID YOU TAKE THAT CAKE TO RUDY? WHEN I CAME TO WORK YESTERDAY, IT WAS ON THE COUNTER. I FIGURED YOU BAKED IT THE NIGHT BEFORE, BECAUSE YOU WERE GOING TO HAVE IT ON THE SHOW, AND THEN I GOT A TEXT FROM YOU ASKING ME TO BRING IT TO RUDY'S APARTMENT, SO I DID. I DIDN'T... I DIDN'T SEND YOU A TEXT. IT WAS YOUR NUMBER. YOUR NAME POPPED RIGHT UP ON MY SCREEN. I WAS WITH RUDY ON THE SET. WHY WOULD I SEND A CAKE TO HIS APARTMENT? HOW SHOULD I KNOW? WHY DIDN'T YOU CHECK? IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE I NEEDED TO CHECK UNTIL RUDY GOT POISONED, THEN THE POLICE WERE THERE AND I COULDN'T SAY ANYTHING. YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM. THERE'S MORE. WHEN I GOT BACK TO THE RESTAURANT, I FOUND AN OLD CAN OF RAT POISON UNDER THE SINK. CYANOCIDE. THE ONLY INGREDIENT IS CYANIDE. MAURICE... I DIDN'T PUT IT TOGETHER. I FIGURED SOMEBODY FOUND IT IN THE BASEMENT. NO ONE USES CYANIDE FOR PEST CONTROL ANYMORE. YOU CAN'T EVEN BUY IT. I KNEW IT WAS DANGEROUS, SO I TOOK IT AND PUT IT IN MY CAR. IN YOUR CAR? WELL, I COULDN'T THROW IT IN THE DUMPSTER. THERE WAS ENOUGH CYANIDE IN THAT CAN TO WIPE OUT HALF THE WEST COAST. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS, NOT AT FIRST. AFTER RUDY DIED, I HID IT. THAT'S EVIDENCE! THERE'S SOMEONE TRYING TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE YOU POISONED RUDY. IF I TOLD THE POLICE ABOUT THAT CYANIDE, YOU'D BE IN HERE, NOT ME, AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. IF YOU DON'T TELL THEM, AND THEY FIND IT, THEY'LL THINK YOU POISONED RUDY. CAN YOU GET FEATHERS? HE'S ALONE AT MY APARTMENT. OKAY. THEY'RE KEEPING HIM. THEY HAVE SECURITY FOOTAGE OF HIM DELIVERING THAT CAKE, AND THEY SAY HE'S A FLIGHT RISK. THE D.A. HAS TWO DAYS TO PRESS CHARGES. I DON'T SEE HOW THEY CAN. HE HAS NO MOTIVE. HE HAS A RECORD. WHAT? YEAH, MAURICE HAS BEEN ARRESTED BEFORE. MAURICE WAS JUST RUNNING THE STREETS WHEN YOUR FATHER MET HIM, AND HIS FAMILY? LIKE A BARREL OF SNAKES, AND YOUR FATHER TRIED TO HELP HIM, BUT MAURICE KEPT GETTING INTO TROUBLE. WHAT KIND OF TROUBLE? BREAK-INS, MOSTLY, AND THAT'S HOW HE ENDED UP IN PRISON, BUT THAT'S WHEN HE LEARNED HOW TO COOK, 'CAUSE YOUR FATHER CONVINCED HIM TO GO INTO THE PROGRAM. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME? BECAUSE IT WAS NOT MY PLACE TO TELL YOU, AND BESIDES, YOUR FATHER SAID DON'T JUDGE HIM BY HIS MISTAKES. WHAT MATTERS IS HOW HE'S CHANGED. HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET THROUGH THIS? OH, MY GOSH. EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME. HEY, HEY, HEY. STAY WITH ME. COME ON. 'SCUSE US! 'SCUSE US. COMING THROUGH. COMING THROUGH. COME ON, COME ON, COME ON, COME ON. HEY, OUT OF THE WAY! OUT OF THE WAY. COMING... COMING THROUGH. HERE WE GO, HERE WE GO. OUT OF THE WAY. OH, MAN, I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT THAT. IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT. ACTUALLY, IT KIND OF IS. I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. I SHOULD HAVE WARNED YOU, BUT GRETCHEN SAID I'D GET BETTER FOOTAGE IF I CAUGHT YOU BY SURPRISE. WHY DON'T I MAKE SOME COFFEE? CHAPTER FIVE... "EVERY CONVERSATION IS IMPROVED BY PIE." WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE? GRETCHEN TOLD EVERYONE MAURICE WAS ARRESTED. AND KIKI CALLED ME, AND WE COULDN'T LEAVE YOU BY YOURSELF. WHY WOULD MAURICE KILL RUDY? MAURICE DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY. MAURICE CAN'T EVEN KILL A SPIDER. HE TAKES THEM OUTSIDE. GRETCHEN SAID THE POLICE HAVE SECURITY FOOTAGE OF HIM DELIVERING THE CAKE. 'CAUSE HE GOT A TEXT FROM MY PHONE, TELLING HIM TO DELIVER IT THERE. YOU TOLD HIM TO DO IT? SOMEBODY ELSE MUST HAVE USED MY PHONE. HERE, HAVE SOME COFFEE. IT'LL HELP YOU THINK. WE SHOULD BE SYSTEMATIC. I MADE A SPREADSHEET. EVERYONE FROM THE RESTAURANT AND THE TV STUDIO AND THEIR CONNECTION TO RUDY. COMPUTER GEEK TO THE RESCUE. LOOK, I KNOW SOME PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE HIM, BUT HE CHANGED MY LIFE. HE GAVE THE COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS AT MY COLLEGE, AND WHEN I TOLD HIM THAT I WANTED TO WORK IN TELEVISION, HE HIRED ME, A FARM GIRL WITH NO EXPERIENCE. WELL, OKAY, FARM GIRL. LET'S SEE WHAT YOU'VE GOT. OKAY. ALL OF THE CONTACT NUMBERS ARE ON THE RIGHT. I'VE STARRED THE PEOPLE WITH THE STRONGEST MOTIVES. IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL. I JUST TRIED TO BE OBJECTIVE. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, HOLD ON, HOLD ON. WHY DO I HAVE A STAR? YOU KNOW HOW RUDY SAID SOMEONE WAS TRYING TO SABOTAGE THE SHOW? LAST WEEK, SOMEONE EMAILED LANIE'S OLD CONTRACT TO LANCE. BEFORE SHE DIED, SHE WAS MAKING TWICE HIS SALARY. OUCH. SO LANCE DEMANDED A RAISE TWICE THE AMOUNT. IT WASN'T IN THE BUDGET, SO RUDY MADE A LIST OF EVERYONE HE COULD CUT... LANCE, BILLIE, OR PHIL. HE WANTED TO FIRE ME? YOU'RE THE HIGHEST-PAID CAMERA OPERATOR ON THE SHOW. DID RUDY CALL YOU YESTERDAY? BECAUSE I SAW A NOTE IN HIS OFFICE. YEAH, BUT HE DIDN'T FIRE ME, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. HE WANTED THE PASSWORD TO THE FILM ARCHIVES SO HE COULD WATCH AUDITION FOOTAGE. IT WAS JUST AFTER THAT BIG FIGHT. I ASSUMED HE WAS LOOKING FOR A DIFFERENT CO-HOST. MAYBE WE SHOULD GIVE TIFFANY A STAR, TOO. I MEAN, IF SHE WAS AFRAID HE WAS GOING TO CHANGE HIS MIND... I THINK WE SHOULD GIVE THIS LIST TO THE POLICE. I AGREE WITH AUNT CASSANDRA. WHOA, MAYBE YOU DIDN'T SEE... THERE'S A STAR BESIDE YOUR NAME. YOU DON'T WANT TO INVESTIGATE? NO. NO... IF WE'RE NOT INVESTIGATING, HOW COME YOU IN HERE, LOOKING LIKE NANCY DREW? YOU SAW THAT LIST. MAURICE IS THE BEST SUSPECT, AND I NEED TO PROVE THAT HE DIDN'T DO IT. OH, IS THAT JUST A FEELING? HOW YOU GOING TO PROVE IT? WELL, I THOUGHT I'D START AT RUDY'S APARTMENT, SEE IF HE HAD ANY OTHER VISITORS YESTERDAY. YOU KNOW, THIS MIGHT SEEM A LITTLE OBVIOUS TO POINT OUT RIGHT NOW, BUT YOUR FATHER WAS THE POLICE OFFICER, NOT YOU. MAURICE IS FAMILY. I AM NOT ABOUT TO LET HIM GO TO JAIL FOR A CRIME HE DIDN'T COMMIT. I KNEW IT WAS YOU. IT'S ME. BILLIE BLESSINGS. MY WIFE WATCHES YOU EVERY MORNING. CAN I GET AN AUTOGRAPH? "POOKIE," HUH? YEAH, IT'S A PET NAME. SHE USED TO BE TERRIFIED TO COOK, BUT YOU GAVE HER CONFIDENCE, CHANGED HER WHOLE LIFE. AW... AND WHAT'S YOUR NAME? OH, ZACH. I GUESS YOU'RE HERE ABOUT MR. SLATER. LOOK, I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED, BUT I'M AFRAID I CAN'T LET YOU INTO THE APARTMENT. ACTUALLY, I WAS WONDERING IF ANYONE ELSE CAME TO SEE RUDY YESTERDAY, BESIDES THE MAN WHO BROUGHT THE CAKE. NO, NOT THAT I SAW, NO, BUT THE POLICE TOOK A COPY OF THE SECURITY FOOTAGE. MAYBE THEY'LL FIND SOMETHING. COPY? DOES THAT MEAN YOU HAVE THE FOOTAGE? OH... I DON'T THINK I'M ALLOWED TO SHOW ANYBODY BESIDES MANAGEMENT. NOT EVEN FOR A FRIEND OF YOUR WIFE? SO IT RUNS 24-7. WE RECORD IT TO THIS COMPUTER, AND THEN BACK IT UP TO A SERVER OFF-SITE EVERY NIGHT. THAT'S MAURICE. THAT WAS YESTERDAY MORNING, ABOUT 9:00... THE USUAL RESIDENTS COMING AND GOING, AND THEN MR. SLATER CAME HOME AT 3:00. THAT'S IT. NOBODY ELSE CAME IN UNTIL HE LEFT ABOUT FOUR HOURS LATER. WAIT. CAN YOU GO BACK? SURE. OKAY, STOP. RIGHT THERE. WHO IS THAT? MISS DIVOSS. HIS FIANCEE. SHE DIDN'T COME IN, AND I DIDN'T WAVE, 'CAUSE I... WELL, I'M TRYING TO BE DISCREET. SHE WAS JUST STANDING THERE? LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO GET ANYONE IN TROUBLE. OF COURSE NOT. OKAY, BETWEEN YOU AND ME? MR. SLATER WAS KIND OF A LADIES' MAN, ONE GIRLFRIEND AFTER ANOTHER. HE WAS SEEING SOMEBODY BEFORE MISS DIVOSS. AND SHE USED TO HANG AROUND THE SAME WAY, ALL MOONY, JUST WATCHING THE BUILDING LIKE, YOU KNOW, MAYBE HE'D CHANGE HIS MIND, BUT HE WAS A PLAYER. MAY HE REST IN PEACE. NO, ONCE HE MOVED ON, IT WAS OVER. YOU THINK THAT'S WHY GRETCHEN DIDN'T COME INSIDE? BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT MR. SLATER HAD MOVED ON? WELL, I CAN'T SAY FOR SURE, BUT I DID SEE HIM WITH A BRUNETTE A FEW TIMES. REAL STUNNER. PENNY FOR YOUR THOUGHTS. ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME? I WASN'T PLANNING TO. I CAME BY THE RESTAURANT JUST AS YOU WERE LEAVING. YOU HAD SUCH AN INTENSE EXPRESSION, I DECIDED TO SEE WHERE IT'D TAKE US. WHY WERE YOU AT THE RESTAURANT? OH, I HEARD YOU FINAGLED YOUR WAY INTO SEEING MAURICE TERREBONE. FINAGLE? NO. VISITS ARE PERMITTED. WELL, MOST OFFICERS WON'T ALLOW IT, AND RUDY'S DOORMAN DEFINITELY WASN'T ALLOWED TO SHOW YOU THAT SECURITY FOOTAGE. INTERFERING WITH A POLICE INVESTIGATION IS A CRIME, BUT IF YOU WANT TO HELP MAURICE, THIS ISN'T THE WAY TO DO IT. IAN, YOU MUST HAVE SEEN GRETCHEN DIVOSS ON THAT SECURITY FOOTAGE. WHY WAS SHE THERE? I CAN'T TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE CASE. AND YESTERDAY, GRETCHEN AND RUDY GOT INTO A BIG FIGHT, AND GRETCHEN TOLD RUDY SHE'D BREAK HIM. DID YOUR FATHER EVER TELL YOU ABOUT OCCAM'S RAZOR? THE SIMPLEST EXPLANATION IS USUALLY THE BEST. MAYBE SHE CAME BY RUDY'S APARTMENT TO APOLOGIZE. IS THAT WHAT SHE TOLD YOU? LOOK, MAURICE GAVE RUDY THE CAKE, NOT GRETCHEN. IAN, MAURICE DOESN'T HAVE A MOTIVE. HE DIDN'T LIKE RUDY'S INFLUENCE OVER YOU. HE WAS AFRAID YOU WERE GETTING SWEPT UP IN THAT SHOW. OKAY, ACCORDING TO EVERYONE I'VE SPOKEN TO, THAT RESTAURANT IS HIS WHOLE LIFE. HE HAS NOTHING ELSE. SO THE PROSPECT OF LOSING THAT, I BET IT MADE HIM FEEL PRETTY DESPERATE. NOT ENOUGH TO KILL SOMEONE. HE'S MADE BAD DECISIONS BEFORE. LOOK, MAURICE TOOK THAT CAKE TO RUDY BECAUSE HE GOT A TEXT FROM ME TELLING HIM TO TAKE IT... ONLY I DIDN'T SEND HIM THE TEXT. LOOK, I KNOW WE HAVE HISTORY, BUT I CAN'T TAKE YOUR PHONE. LOOK, TAKE IT. LOOK THROUGH IT. IT DOESN'T MATTER. LOOK, TAKE IT. YOU WON'T FIND ANYTHING. HEY, FEATHERS! HI. DO YOU WANT TO GO FOR A SLEEPOVER? COME ON. LET'S GO. LET'S GET LEASHED UP. COME ON. COME ON, BUDDY. COME ON. OH, YEAH, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SO MUCH FUN. YES, WE ARE. LET ME GRAB ALL YOUR STUFF. ALL RIGHT. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? WHERE'RE YOU GOING, BUDDY? WHAT'S OVER THERE? YOU WANT A TREAT? OKAY, I'LL GET YOU A TREAT. I'LL GET YOU A TREAT. OH! OH, MY GOODNESS. OH, MY GOODNESS. LET ME THINK. OKAY. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. OKAY, WHAT DO I DO? WHAT DO I DO? ALL RIGHT, UH... OH, BOY. OH... HEY, DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT. YOU KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO COME OVER HERE AND SEARCH THIS PLACE. YOU WANT YOUR DADDY TO GO TO PRISON? OH, BOY. OKAY, LET'S GO, FEATHERS. ALL RIGHT. COME ON, LITTLE GUY. OKAY. OKAY, COME HERE. ALL RIGHT. OKAY, LET ME LET YOU LOOSE. HANG ON, HANG ON. OKAY, GO. IT'S OKAY, BUDDY. IT'S NOTHING. YOU RECOGNIZE THIS? NO. YOU SURE THE DOOR WAS LOCKED? WE DIDN'T FIND ANY SIGN OF FORCED ENTRY. BECAUSE WHOEVER DID THIS MUST HAVE A KEY, LIKE THEY HAVE A KEY TO THE RESTAURANT, WHICH IS HOW THEY GOT THE CAKE INTO THE RESTAURANT KITCHEN. YEAH, UNLESS THE PERSON WHO DID THIS ISN'T RUDY'S KILLER. OCCAM'S RAZOR. THE SIMPLEST EXPLANATION IS USUALLY THE BEST. MAURICE COULDN'T HAVE DONE THIS, BECAUSE HE'S IN JAIL. MAYBE THEY SAW ME AT RUDY'S BUILDING. OR THEY SAW YOU DOING SOMETHING ELSE I DON'T KNOW ABOUT. WELL, YOU WERE FOLLOWING ME, SO YOU KNOW EVERYTHING. IT'S JUST TEMPORARY. SO, TIFFANY, THIS IS YOUR SECOND DAY WITH US. HOW DO YOU LIKE US SO FAR? HOW DO YOU LIKE HAVING ME? OH, BOY. LOOKS LIKE SHE'S GOING TO MAKE ME SAY IT. I FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE BEEN PART OF OUR FAMILY FOREVER. AM I RIGHT, VIEWERS? WHY ARE YOU NOT AT THE STUDIO? I CALLED IN SICK. I CAN'T TAKE ANOTHER DAY AS GRETCHEN'S ASSISTANT. LOSING OUR EXECUTIVE PRODUCER THE NIGHT BEFORE YOU STARTED... THAT WAS A SHOCK. IT WAS A SHOCK. I THINK LANCE HAS A CRUSH ON HER. HE'S FOLLOWING HER AROUND LIKE A BABY DUCK. BUT I UNDERSTAND THE POLICE ALREADY HAVE SOMEONE IN CUSTODY. THIS MAY SOUND CRAZY, BUT... DO YOU THINK RUDY WAS SEEING HER? I GUESS YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE PICTURES. THESE WERE POSTED TWO DAYS BEFORE RUDY DIED. I THINK IT'S WHAT HE AND GRETCHEN WERE FIGHTING ABOUT. WHO WOULD TAKE THESE? RUDY THOUGHT GRETCHEN HIRED A PRIVATE DETECTIVE BECAUSE SHE WAS JEALOUS, AND SOMEONE LEAKED THESE PICTURES TO THIS WEBSITE. WHAT IF GRETCHEN LEAKED THE PICTURES? GRETCHEN? WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT? SHE TOLD RUDY SHE'D DESTROY THE SHOW. THAT'S PRETTY CRAZY, EVEN FOR GRETCHEN. GRETCHEN WAS AT RUDY'S APARTMENT BUILDING THE DAY HE DIED. ARE YOU SAYING GRETCHEN KILLED HIM? I THINK I NEED TO PAY TIFFANY A VISIT, AND FIND OUT WHY GRETCHEN WAS SO UPSET. BILLIE! I WAS STRESS SHOPPING. IF I WOULD HAVE KNOWN YOU WERE HERE, I WOULD HAVE COME STRAIGHT FROM THE STUDIO. OH, I GUESS MY SECRET'S OUT. I'M YOUR BIGGEST FAN. I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE HERE IN MY LITTLE KITCHEN. I WATCHED YOU ON THE SHOW THIS MORNING. YOU DID A GREAT JOB. THAT IS JUST BECAUSE YOU TALKED ME OFF THAT LEDGE. HOW DID... HOW DID RUDY FIND YOU, ANYWAY? I HAD A STYLE SHOW. I WAS COMMUNITY TV. NOBODY EVER SAW IT, BUT RUDY SHOWED UP ONE DAY AND TOLD ME THAT HE WOULD MAKE ME A STAR. JUST BETWEEN YOU AND ME, I STILL DON'T KNOW WHY HE DID THAT. DO YOU THINK THAT RUDY COULD HAVE BEEN... MAYBE JUST A LITTLE BIT IN LOVE WITH YOU? YOU SAW THE PICTURES. I WAS AFRAID THAT WOULD HAPPEN. YOU MUST THINK I'M A TERRIBLE PERSON. NO! NO. OUR RELATIONSHIP WAS STRICTLY PROFESSIONAL. THAT'S WHY THOSE PICTURES WERE SO UPSETTING. GRETCHEN CALLED ME AS SOON AS SHE SAW THEM. SHE SAID THAT I DIDN'T KNOW WHO I WAS DEALING WITH. MM. SOUNDS LIKE GRETCHEN. RUDY SAID THAT SHE COULD BE A BIT JEALOUS, AND RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING, HE DIDN'T WANT ME ON SET. WE HAD TO MEET IN COFFEE SHOPS. HE EVEN SNUCK ME INTO HIS APARTMENT THROUGH THE SERVICE ENTRANCE. YOU WENT TO HIS APARTMENT? OH, NO, NOT LIKE THAT. JUST TO SIGN THE CONTRACTS. YOU MUST HAVE BEEN THERE THE DAY RUDY GOT THE CAKE. I WAS THERE FOR FIVE MINUTES, AND I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING. I SIGNED THE CONTRACTS AND I LEFT. PLEASE DON'T TELL THE POLICE. WAIT... IT WASN'T JUST FOR THE PICTURES. AS SOON AS I MET RUDY, I STARTED GETTING THESE PHONE CALLS FROM THIS UNLISTED NUMBER. THEY WOULD BREATHE AND THEN THEY WOULD HANG UP. I FOUND A MESSAGE ON MY CAR IN LIPSTICK. "CO-HOST," CROSSED OUT WITH A BIG X. RUDY THOUGHT IT WAS SOMEBODY FROM THE SHOW, AND HE SAID THEY WERE UNSTABLE... BUT THE DAY THAT RUDY DIED... HE TOLD ME HE KNEW WHO WAS DOING IT. HE HAD PROOF. HE WAS PLANNING ON TAKING IT TO THE POLICE. TIFFANY! YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM. I CAN'T. I MEAN, DON'T YOU SEE? SOMEONE KILLED RUDY. IF THEY THINK THAT I KNOW SOMETHING, THEY'LL KILL ME, TOO. HEY. OH, THANK GOODNESS. WHAT'S GOING ON? THE POLICE SAID WE COULD RE-OPEN. CASSANDRA SAID IF YOU DIDN'T GET HERE IN FIVE MINUTES, SHE WAS GOING TO MAKE ME A SOUS-CHEF. WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN? I HAVE BEEN CALLING YOU ALL DAY. I DON'T HAVE MY PHONE. OH, HONESTLY! YOU WOULD LOSE YOUR HEAD IF IT WASN'T ATTACHED TO YOUR NECK. WE HAVE 40 RESERVATIONS, AND A WAIT LIST, AND WE OPEN IN A HALF HOUR. LISTEN UP, PEOPLE! I WANT YOUR BEST EFFORTS TONIGHT. WE NEED TO RE-OPEN WITH CONFIDENCE, SO THAT OUR CUSTOMERS CAN RETURN TO THE PLACE THAT THEY HAVE LOVED AND TRUSTED FOR THE LAST 12 YEARS. LET'S GO. CAN YOU TAKE OVER, PLEASE? I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M DOING. I... I THINK WE SHOULD SEND THE STAFF HOME. I MEAN, MAYBE THEY DIDN'T KNOW WE WERE OPEN. NO, THEY DID. I CALLED EVERY RESERVATION AND THE ENTIRE WAIT LIST. THEY KNEW. I GUESS THE PROSPECT OF CYANIDE POISONING KILLED THEIR APPETITES. DIDN'T HAVE A WAY TO CALL YOU, SO I JUST THOUGHT I'D SWING BY. COULD'VE CALLED THE RESTAURANT. WELL, I WANTED TO MAKE SURE I GOT YOU IN PERSON, THOUGH. MM. MAURICE DID RECEIVE A TEXT FROM YOUR NUMBER. WE CHECKED HIS PHONE. HE DELETED THE TEXT, BUT TECH TEAM FOUND IT AGAIN. WE LOCATED ALL THE PHONE COMPANY RECORDS, AND IT TURNS OUT THAT TEXT HE GOT... WAS SPOOFED. SPOOFED? SOMEONE USED AN ILLEGAL PROGRAM TO SUBSTITUTE YOUR NUMBER FOR THEIRS, AND THE ONLY WAY TO CATCH THAT IS THE SERIAL NUMBER. OH, AND WHAT HAPPENED TO IT? DIDN'T MATCH YOUR PHONE. SO YOU WERE RIGHT. LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE SET HIM UP. ANY IDEA WHO THAT WAS? OH, NO, THE SERIAL NUMBER WAS FAKE, TOO. IT'S A PRETTY GOOD TRICK. NO WAY TO TRACE IT. MM. WELL... ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I COULD MAKE YOU DINNER. ABOUT TO TAKE THREE DOZEN STEAKS DOWN TO A SOUP KITCHEN, SO... I WOULD LIKE THAT. COME ON. NOW I SEE WHY YOU'RE SO FAMOUS. MAURICE IS THE REAL CHEF, AND MY DAD. WELL, YOU DO A GREAT IMPERSONATION. YEAH, WHEN I FIRST GOT OUT OF COLLEGE, I WROTE FOOD REVIEWS FOR THIS LITTLE PAPER. SO WHEN MY DAD OPENED THE RESTAURANT, HE AND MAURICE RAN THE KITCHEN. I DID THE "VISION" THING. WHAT WAS THE VISION? FOOD IS LOVE. I KNOW IT SOUNDS CORNY, BUT IT WAS SO TRUE, FOR BOTH OF THEM, AND I WANTED PEOPLE TO GET THAT MESSAGE. WELL, I THINK WE DO. YEAH, WELL, IT WAS A LOT OF WORK, ESPECIALLY IN THE BEGINNING. IS THAT WHY YOU NEVER GOT MARRIED? FUTURE SENATOR SAID I MARRIED THE RESTAURANT. - OUCH. - YEAH. AUNT CASSANDRA NEVER FELT WE WERE A GREAT MATCH. THEN MY DAD DIED, AND I HAD TO TEACH MYSELF HOW TO BE A CHEF. I WROTE A COOKBOOK, AND RUDY PUT ME ON THE SHOW, AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, I ENDED UP HERE... COOKING DINNER FOR YOU. WELL, WHAT CAN I SAY? SOMETIMES, I GUESS I JUST GET LUCKY. AND... WHY DID WE STOP DATING? TRUTHFULLY? WELL, YOU WERE HEADING OFF TO COLLEGE, AND I WAS TRAINING TO BE A COP, SO I JUST TOLD MYSELF YOU WERE OVER MY PAY GRADE. MY DAD WAS A COP. BY THE TIME I PUT THAT TOGETHER, YOU WERE WITH THE SENATOR. AND BY THE TIME HE AND I BROKE UP, YOU WERE MARRIED. YEAH. I GUESS WE JUST KEPT MISSING EACH OTHER. UH, SPEAKING OF WHICH, ISN'T THERE SOME RULE ABOUT HAVING DINNER WITH SUSPECTS? I DON'T SEE ANY SUSPECTS. YOU'RE NOT LOOKING HARD ENOUGH. D.A. DECIDED NOT TO PRESS CHARGES. OH! MAURICE, I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE HERE. I WANTED TO TELL YOU. I JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHEN IT WOULD BE OFFICIAL. YOU SHOULD GO. MAURICE! NO. IT'S OKAY. I'LL LET YOU TWO CATCH UP. THANK YOU. IT'S AMAZING. WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT? I DON'T TRUST HIM, AND YOU SHOULDN'T EITHER. HE'S THE REASON WHY THEY DECIDED NOT TO PRESS CHARGES. MAYBE... OR MAYBE THEY HAVE MORE INTEREST IN YOU. YOU REALLY THINK I'M A SUSPECT? IAN'S PARTNER FOUND ME OUTSIDE THE COURTHOUSE. HE SAID, "DON'T GET TOO COMFORTABLE." AND IF THE POLICE THINK YOU BAKED THAT CAKE FOR RUDY, HE'S GOING TO MAKE YOU PAY. AND RUDY DIED IN YOUR RESTAURANT. I DON'T THINK IT'S WISE TO INVITE THE DETECTIVES OVER TO DINNER. I DIDN'T INVITE HIM. HE JUST SHOWED UP. YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR FATHER SAID ABOUT IAN JACKSON? HE'S NICE, AND THAT'S HIS SUPERPOWER. CRIMINALS, THEY TRUST HIM, AND YOU COULD BE TELLING HIM THINGS THAT COULD GET YOU IN TROUBLE, AND YOU WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW. I GAVE HIM MY PHONE. WHAT? AND I HAVE THE CYANIDE. IT'S IN MY CLOSET. WELL, LOOK, YOU DIDN'T HIDE IT VERY WELL. IT WAS RIGHT IN YOUR CUPBOARD. WHY WOULD YOU TAKE IT? I DIDN'T WANT THE POLICE TO SEARCH YOUR APARTMENT. AND WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY SEARCH YOUR HOUSE? I HAVEN'T GOTTEN THAT FAR YET. YOU WERE IN JAIL, NOT ME. COME ON, FEATHERS. ATTABOY. YOU DO THAT EVERY NIGHT? MAURICE TERREBONE. I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU FUSSING OVER THAT DOG. THEY THINK BILLIE DID IT? THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. WELL, THAT DETECTIVE NEEDS TO WORK ON HIS POWERS OF OBSERVATION. BILLIE WAS RUDY'S ONLY FRIEND, AND THERE'S A WHOLE PHONEBOOK OF PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T LIKE HIM, STARTING WITH THAT PRICKLY ONE HE WAS ABOUT TO MARRY. GRETCHEN. YEAH, GRETCHEN... DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT THEY HAD SOME KIND OF BIG FIGHT RIGHT BEFORE HE DIED? YEAH, GRETCHEN THOUGHT RUDY WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR. MM-HMM. LOOKS LIKE TROUBLE TO ME. TIFFANY SAID THEIR RELATIONSHIP WAS STRICTLY PROFESSIONAL. OF COURSE SHE SAID THAT. MY FIRST HUSBAND? DENY, DENY, DENY. THEY DENY WHEN YOU CATCH THEM RED-HANDED. IT'S WHAT THEY CLING TO. OH, LOOK. LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE BEEN TALKING BUSINESS FOR A WHILE. CHRISTMAS WAS NINE MONTHS AGO, AND WE WEREN'T EVEN LOOKING FOR A CO-HOST. WELL, I GUESS GRETCHEN HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO BUILD UP A RESENTMENT. I THINK SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN STALKING TIFFANY. I HOPE TIFFANY TOLD THE POLICE. SHE WAS TOO AFRAID. YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HER. SHE WAS TERRIFIED. TIFFANY MOON? I REALLY CAN'T TALK. IT SHOULDN'T TAKE LONG. THOSE PHOTOS ARE MISLEADING. RUDY AND I WERE NOT IN A RELATIONSHIP. ACCORDING TO HIS PHONE RECORDS, YOU CALLED HIS PRIVATE NUMBER ONCE A MONTH FOR THE LAST NINE MONTHS. I CAN EXPLAIN. I WAS HOPING YOU'D SAY THAT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? THE SAME AS YOU. PAYING MY RESPECTS. KIKI TELL YOU I'M GOING ON STRIKE? EVERYTHING OUT OF FOCUS 'TIL YOU'RE BACK ON THE SHOW, WITH COOKIES. CHAPTER TEN, "GOOD COOKIES MAKE GOOD FRIENDS." IT'S NO FUN WITHOUT YOU. I'M FUN. STILL WORKING ON THAT SPREADSHEET? WHO GETS A STAR TODAY? GRETCHEN. YEAH, PRETTY SURE SHE LEFT A THREATENING MESSAGE FOR TIFFANY, ON HER CAR, IN LIPSTICK. OKAY. THAT'S UNSETTLING. HMM. HOW LONG DO YOU THINK I HAVE BEFORE SHE KICKS ME OUT? SHE CAN'T KICK YOU OUT OF A FUNERAL. SAYS WHO? I NEED TO TALK TO TIFFANY. REMIND ME TO CALL HER NEXT TIME I NEED A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR. BILLIE BLESSINGS. I HEARD YOU GOT YOURSELF FIRED. WELL, YOUR FANS ARE IN AN UPROAR. I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU HAD SO MANY. WE'RE GETTING SLAMMED ON SOCIAL MEDIA. I'M SORRY. HEY, I TOLD MY DAUGHTER IT WAS A MISTAKE. I COULDN'T TALK HER OUT OF IT. SHE'S A LITTLE TEMPERAMENTAL. DO YOU THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH TEA SANDWICHES? GET OUT OF MY WAY. AND HERE SHE IS. PERFECT TIMING. YOU MADE YOUR POWER PLAY. NOW I'D APPRECIATE IT IF YOU'D LEAVE SO I CAN MOURN. I WAS JUST SAYING, WE NEED TO FIND A WAY TO GET BILLIE BACK ON THE SHOW. WE'LL HAVE TIFFANY INTERVIEW HER. THEY CAN FACT-CHECK A FEW RUMORS. MAYBE EVEN FIND THE KILLER, FLUSH THEM OUT OF HIDING. DO WE REALLY WANT THE SHOW TO HAVE THAT KIND OF REPUTATION? YES. I MEAN, YES, I WOULD LIKE TO BE ON THE SHOW. NO, IT'S TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE. GREAT, THE MORE INAPPROPRIATE, THE BETTER. OUR RATINGS WILL GO THROUGH THE ROOF. I'M SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS. SHE CLAIMS SHE SENT RUDY A DEMO LAST CHRISTMAS. SHE WANTED TO DO A STYLE SEGMENT. RUDY TOOK AN INTEREST. HIS FIANCEE SAID THERE WASN'T ENOUGH MONEY IN THE BUDGET. SMART WOMAN. DOES IT STRIKE YOU AS STRANGE THAT TIFFANY TRIES TO GET ON THE SHOW, AND SIX MONTHS LATER, LANIE HAYWOOD DIES? THAT WAS A FOOD ALLERGY. TIFFANY WAS PRETTY JUMPY YESTERDAY. SHE'S HIDING SOMETHING. WHAT IF RUDY KILLED LANIE SO HE COULD PUT TIFFANY ON THE SHOW? BECAUSE HE WANTED TO BE WITH HER? MAYBE. THEN ONCE TIFFANY GOT A SIGNED CONTRACT, SHE GOT RID OF HIM. HEY... DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS? NO. AND WE ARE BACK! WELL, VIEWERS, WE HAVE A VERY SPECIAL GUEST TODAY... BILLIE BLESSINGS. GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK, BILLIE. IT'S GOOD TO BE HERE. I'M GOING TO CUT RIGHT TO THE CHASE. A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW HOW RUDY SLATER GOT THAT POISONED CAKE. LET'S ASK THE QUESTION. DID YOU BAKE IT? WHO DO YOU THINK BAKED THE CAKE? UH... I'M NOT SURE. YOU MUST HAVE SOME IDEA. THE OTHER DAY, YOU SAID YOU WERE FEELING THREATENED. DID I SAY THAT? I DON'T REMEMBER. IT SOUNDED LIKE RUDY WAS WORRIED FOR YOUR SAFETY. I DOUBT I USED THOSE EXACT WORDS. THAT SOUNDS PRETTY DRAMATIC. SHE'S COMPLETELY OFF-SCRIPT. SHOULD I CUT TO COMMERCIAL? THREATENING MESSAGES ON YOUR CAR... KEEP IT GOING. POSTED PICTURES OF YOU AND RUDY ON THE INTERNET. OH, THOSE PICTURES ARE NOT ACCURATE. NO, I MEAN, THEY HAPPENED, BUT NOT THE WAY IT LOOKS. MY RELATIONSHIP WITH RUDY WAS STRICTLY PROFESSIONAL. RUDY FIGURED OUT WHO WAS TRYING TO HURT YOU BEFORE HE DIED, DIDN'T HE? HE TOLD YOU HE HAD PROOF. I GUESS THAT'S WHAT SHE WAS HIDING. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL THE POLICE? DON'T WORRY. WE'RE ALL HERE FOR YOU. I PROMISE, WE'RE GOING TO KEEP YOU SAFE. I DIDN'T TELL THE POLICE... BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID. DO YOU KNOW WHO KILLED RUDY? NO... BUT I THINK THEY KILLED LANIE. LANIE HAYWOOD? RUDY NEVER UNDERSTOOD HOW SHE DIED FROM HAZELNUT COFFEE. SHE WAS TOO CAREFUL WITH HER FOOD ALLERGIES, SO WHEN I STARTED RECEIVING THREATS, HE SAID HE THOUGHT LANIE HAD BEEN POISONED. WE NEED A TOX SCREEN ON LANIE HAYWOOD. I WANT HER TESTED FOR EVERYTHING... ESPECIALLY CYANIDE. A LITTLE TOUGH TO GET A WORD IN EDGEWISE, BUT THAT WAS QUITE THE SCOOP. NICE JOB? I THINK SHE'S THE MOST CLEVER PERSON I HAVE EVER MET. WELL, NOT REALLY THAT CLEVER. I WASN'T REALLY SURE WHICH WAY THAT WAS GOING TO GO. I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU WERE DOING AT FIRST, AND THEN I REALIZED THAT IF I TOLD EVERYBODY ON TV, NOBODY COULD HURT ME. I FEEL SAFE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN WEEKS. LANIE MIGHT HAVE BEEN MURDERED. NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO CELEBRATE. I MIGHT HAVE BEEN WRONG ABOUT YOU, TIFFANY. FOR THAT, I'M SORRY. I HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE SO FRIGHTENED. LET'S TALK. BILLIE, THAT WAS ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING LIVE INTERVIEWS I HAVE EVER SEEN. I WISH I COULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING LIKE THAT. YOU MUST REALLY BE PROUD. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK. FIRST LESSON OF LIVE TELEVISION, YOU NEVER GET WHAT YOU EXPECT. YOU LOOKED A LITTLE SURPRISED OUT THERE. MAYBE YOU WERE HOPING THAT TIFFANY WOULD SAY GRETCHEN KILLED RUDY. TO BE HONEST, I'VE WONDERED THAT MYSELF. I SAW THOSE PICTURES ON THE INTERNET, AND BELIEVE ME, I CAUGHT AN EARFUL WHEN I SIGNED TIFFANY'S CONTRACT. YEAH, I HAVE TO ADMIT, I WAS STARTING TO GET A LITTLE WORRIED... RIGHT UP UNTIL THAT LANIE SHOCKER. DOESN'T IT BOTHER YOU THAT TWO PEOPLE WE CARED ABOUT WERE MURDERED? I LIKE YOU, BILLIE, BUT GRETCHEN IS MY LITTLE GIRL. IF YOU HURT HER, I WILL MAKE YOU PAY. LISTEN... TIFFANY WAS AFRAID. I WANTED TO HELP HER TALK. I HAD NO IDEA SHE WAS GOING TO SAY THAT STUFF ABOUT LANIE. YOU SHOULD STOP. WE NEED TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS. NOBODY EVER SUSPECTED LANIE HAYWOOD WAS POISONED. WHAT DID YOU HOPE TO GAIN BY BRINGING IT UP ON LIVE TV? I DIDN'T BRING IT UP. TIFFANY DID. I THINK YOU HAD TIFFANY ANNOUNCE IT TO MAKE YOURSELF LOOK INNOCENT. HIDE IN PLAIN SIGHT. WHAT WOULD I BE HIDING? YOU TELL ME. GRETCHEN DIVOSS SAID YOU BAKED MUFFINS THE DAY LANIE DIED. THREE PEOPLE SAID THEY SAW YOU GIVE ONE TO LANIE. YOU THINK I POISONED HER? RUDY FOUND OUT, YOU POISONED HIM, TOO. YOU HAD MAURICE TERREBONE DELIVER THAT CAKE RIGHT ON CAMERA, AND THEN YOU SENT HIM A FAKE TEXT TO GET BOTH OF YOU OFF THE HOOK. I DID NOT SEND THAT TEXT. OKAY, BUT YOU DID WRITE THAT SCARY MESSAGE IN YOUR OWN HOUSE TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THE KILLER WAS STALKING YOU. WHY ASSUME THAT? WOULDN'T IT MAKE MORE SENSE THAT SOMEONE BROKE INTO MY HOUSE? WE FOUND A RECEIPT ON YOUR PHONE. YOU BOUGHT LIPSTICK. PASSION FLOWER. IT MATCHES THE LIPSTICK THAT WAS USED ON TIFFANY'S CAR, AND IN RUDY'S WINE CLOSET. WELL, YOU MUST SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING. SOMEONE IS SETTING ME UP. WE ARE EXPLORING OTHER SUSPECTS, BUT THE EVIDENCE IS PRETTY STRONG. I DIDN'T WANT LANIE'S JOB. I TOLD RUDY I WOULDN'T TAKE IT. THAT'S A CONVENIENT STORY, SINCE RUDY'S NOT HERE TO CONFIRM OR DENY IT. AM I UNDER ARREST? WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR LANIE'S TOX SCREEN. I DIDN'T KILL ANYONE. THAT'S WHAT MY PARTNER THINKS. MYSELF, I'M STARTING TO ACQUIRE A FEW DOUBTS. KIKI OWENS? HEY, SO-- SO WHAT DID THE COPS SAY? DID THEY MENTION THAT LIST? PEOPLE RUDY WANTED TO FIRE? THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT LIST. THEY THINK I DID IT. WHAT? WHY? BECAUSE I WANTED LANIE'S JOB. NO, NO, NO, NO, YOU'RE THE NICEST PERSON ON THIS SHOW. THAT'S NOT WHAT THE POLICE THINK. WELL IF IT'S ABOUT LANIE'S JOB, THEN THEY SHOULD BE LOOKING AT TIFFANY. I MEAN, SHE'S THE ONE THAT GOT IT, PLUS SHE TRIED TO GET ON THE SHOW BEFORE. TIFFANY? YEAH, SHE SENT US A DEMO LAST CHRISTMAS. SHE WANTED TO DO, LIKE, A STYLE SEGMENT. PHIL! OH, NO, NO. NO, NO, NO. DON'T GO ALL SHERLOCK ON ME. I'M NOT SAYING THAT TIFFANY KILLED LANIE. WHAT IF SHE DID? FIRST OF ALL, YOU SHOULD PAY MORE ATTENTION TO YOUR OWN INTERVIEW. RUDY DIDN'T THINK TIFFANY WAS A KILLER. SHE WAS BEING THREATENED. HE WAS TRYING TO PROTECT HER. ACCORDING TO TIFFANY. MAYBE SHE MADE UP ALL THAT STUFF ABOUT BEING THREATENED JUST TO THROW EVERYBODY OFF. NUMBER TWO, TIFFANY DOES NOT HAVE THE BANDWIDTH TO KILL ANYONE. MAYBE THAT'S WHAT SHE WANTS US TO THINK. SHE HAS THE MOTIVE. WE KNOW RUDY WAS LOOKING AT AUDITION FOOTAGE. MAYBE WE SHOULD CHECK OUT THAT DEMO REEL. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE NOTICED, BUT THERE ARE COPS CRAWLING ALL OVER THIS PLACE. I SHOULDN'T EVEN BE TALKING TO YOU. YOU COULD GIVE ME THAT PASSWORD. THE AUDITION FOOTAGE ISN'T ON THE SERVER. YOU CAN ONLY ACCESS IT FROM TWO COMPUTERS, RUDY'S AND MINE. I CAN MEET YOU AFTER WORK. WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE? YOU NEED TO LEAVE, RIGHT NOW... AND IF I EVER SEE YOU TALKING TO HER AGAIN, YOU'RE FIRED. WHERE ARE YOU? ON MY WAY HOME... OR JAIL. I'M NOT SURE. YOU SEE THE INTERVIEW? LISTEN, UM... THE COPS ARE HERE SEARCHING YOUR HOUSE. MAURICE... DON'T WORRY, I TOOK CARE OF IT WHILE YOU WERE AT RUDY'S FUNERAL. UH, I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD COME BACK YET. OKAY. LAY LOW FOR A WHILE. IT'S NICE TO KNOW IT'S STILL YOUR FAVORITE PLACE. LET ME GUESS. YOU'RE WAITING FOR THE POLICE TO FINISH SEARCHING YOUR HOUSE. CAN YOU BLAME ME? PEACE OFFERING. MY DETECTIVE PARTNER GOT A LITTLE OVERHEATED. SO IS THIS SOME NEW STRATEGY SO I DON'T REALIZE I'M BEING INTERROGATED? LOOK... I DON'T THINK YOU KILLED RUDY. YOU COULD TALK TO ME, THOUGH, AND TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW. IT'D HELP ME. TALK TO YOU AS A DETECTIVE, OR AS A FRIEND? WELL, DETECTIVES HAVE FRIENDS. WELL, AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT I'VE HEARD. LOOK, IAN... TIFFANY MOON WAS AT RUDY'S APARTMENT THE DAY HE DIED. SHE GOT IN THROUGH SOME SIDE ENTRANCE SO NO ONE WOULD SEE HER GETTING IN THE BUILDING. WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SOMETHING BEFORE? I WAS TRYING TO PROTECT HER. SHE SAID THAT IF THE KILLER KNEW THAT SHE WAS THERE, THEY MIGHT TRY TO HURT HER, BUT NOW I'M STARTING TO WONDER... AND YOU NEED TO CHECK THAT DEMO, 'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S ON IT, BUT RUDY WAS DEFINITELY LOOKING FOR IT BEFORE HE DIED. OKAY. THANK YOU. FOR WHAT? FOR TRUSTING ME. PHIL? PHIL! PHIL! IT'S A GOOD THIN THE WHOLE HOUSE WOULD HAVE BURNED DOWN, WITH HIM IN IT. IS HE GOING TO BE OKAY? YEAH, HE SEEMS OKAY. THEY'RE TAKING HIM TO THE E.R. TO BE SURE. I'M GOING TO NEED YOUR NAME AND CONTACT INFORMATION, PLEASE. EXCUSE ME! OH, ONE SECOND. HEY, DO I KNOW YOU? NO, I DON'T THINK SO. PEOPLE ARE KILLING MY GRASS. OKAY, MA'AM... BILLIE TEXTS ME. SHE ASKS ME TO MEET HER AT MY HOUSE SO WE COULD LOOK AT TIFFANY MOON'S DEMO. I PUT THIS CRAZY IDEA IN HER HEAD THAT TIFFANY KILLED LANIE TO GET HER JOB, AND, I DON'T KNOW, I FELT REALLY BAD ABOUT IT. SO I WENT HOME. I FIGURED I COULD SHOW BILLIE THE TAPE AND WE'D JUST PUT IT ALL BEHIND US, BUT AS SOON AS I WALKED IN THAT DOOR, SOMEONE CRACKED ME ON THE BACK OF THE HEAD. THAT'S THE LAST THING I REMEMBER. YOU THINK BILLIE DID IT? NO. WE'RE GOING TO NEED A COPY OF THAT DEMO. IF YOU THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE, GIVE ME A CALL. YEAH. WE'VE GOT TO GET A COPY OF TIFFANY'S DEMO. HE KNEW SHE WAS COMING OVER. WHY IS HE PROTECTING HER? WELL, LET'S CHECK HER GPS. SEE IF IT PUTS HER AT NARDI'S HOUSE. NO, WE CAN'T. WE HAVE HER TRACKING DATA, AND IT'S LEGAL. SHE GAVE US THE PHONE. IT'S NOT HOW I WORK. YEAH, I KNOW HOW YOU WORK. FRIENDS WITH EVERYONE. IRON FIST IN A VELVET GLOVE. YOU SEEMED A LITTLE TOO COZY WITH HER THE OTHER NIGHT, WHEN SHE MADE YOU DINNER. SO YOU TRACKING ME NOW, TOO? ACTUALLY, I WAS FOLLOWING THE CHEF. I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE YOU THERE. TO BE HONEST, IT KIND OF MAKES ME QUESTION YOUR OBJECTIVITY. MY OBJECTIVITY IS INTACT, THANKS. I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN. THEN LET'S JUST CHECK THE GPS. IT SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM UNLESS SHE'S GOT SOMETHING TO HIDE, RIGHT? TAKE THAT AS A YES. YOU WALKED AWAY FROM THE SCENE OF A CRIME? I DIDN'T WALK. I DROVE. THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME TO TELL HER ABOUT THE CYANIDE. CYANIDE? YOU'RE RIGHT. I MADE A MISTAKE. I'LL CALL THE POLICE. NO, YOU WON'T! I CAN JUST EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED. AND THEN WHAT? YOU'RE JUST GOING TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE A NICE PIECE OF CELEBRATION CAKE? WHO WOULD WANT TO BLOW UP PHIL'S PLACE, ANYWAY? HE WAS ABOUT TO SHOW ME TIFFANY'S DEMO. I THINK IT MIGHT CONNECT HER TO LANIE'S MURDER. YOU THINK SHE KILLED LANIE? AND SHE WAS IN RUDY'S APARTMENT THE DAY HE DIED. TIFFANY QUIT. QUIT? I FOUND HER LEAVING A NOTE ON YOUR DESK AFTER THE POLICE INTERVIEWS. SHE SAID LIVE TELEVISION IS TOO STRESSFUL. SHE'S GOING BACK TO PEEBLES FALLS. WHEN? SOUNDS LIKE TONIGHT. SOMEBODY'S IN A HURRY. WE HAVE TO STOP HER. LEAVE YOUR PHONE. THE POLICE HAD IT. THEY CAN TRACK YOU. WHAT IS HAPPENING? I THINK TIFFANY KILLED LANIE AND RUDY. UH... I'LL GO WITH HER. DO YOU HAVE A PLAN? TO KEEP TIFFANY FROM LEAVING. MAYBE WE'RE TOO LATE. TIFFANY? TIFFANY? WHY WOULD SHE RUN? SHE WASN'T EVEN A SUSPECT. MAYBE SOMETHING CHANGED. BILLIE? WELL, YOU'VE CAUGHT ME. CAUGHT YOU? I WAS TRYING TO SNEAK AWAY, BUT I FORGOT MY PHONE. HOPE YOU'RE NOT MAD. YOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE. THOSE TWO DETECTIVES INTERVIEWED ME. I TOLD THEM EVERYTHING I KNOW. YOU TOLD THEM YOU WERE AT RUDY'S APARTMENT? I MIGHT HAVE SKIPPED OVER THAT PART, BUT THAT JUST SEEMS LIKE THE KIND OF FIDDLY DETAIL THAT EVERYBODY WOULD GET CAUGHT UP ON. PHIL SAID RUDY HAD A RECORDING IDENTIFYING THE KILLER. - HE DID? - HE DOES? YEAH, WELL... HE MIGHT. I THINK SO. PHIL SAID IT WAS AT RUDY'S APARTMENT. IN HIS APARTMENT? WE SHOULD TELL THE POLICE. PHIL TOLD THE POLICE, THE POLICE LOOKED FOR IT. THEY COULDN'T FIND IT, BUT PHIL SAYS IT'S PROBABLY THERE. SO IF WE WANT TO CATCH THE KILLER, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIND THIS RECORDING ON OUR OWN. IN RUDY'S APARTMENT. RIGHT. HOW DO WE GET IN? OH, I KNOW HOW. DON'T WORRY. RUDY SAID NOBODY EVER USES THE SERVICE ENTRANCE. THE SECURITY CAMERAS BACK HERE DON'T EVEN WORK. WHAT EXACTLY ARE WE DOING HERE? PROVING TIFFANY KNOWS HOW TO GET INTO RUDY'S APARTMENT. DID PHIL SAY THAT, ABOUT THE RECORDING? NO, BUT THERE IS A RECORDING. IT MAY CONNECT TIFFANY TO LANIE'S MURDER, AND I'M PRETTY SURE SHE TRIED TO KILL PHIL TO KEEP HIM FROM SHOWING IT TO ME. SHE TRIED TO KILL PHIL? FOUND IT. KIND OF SPOOKY, ISN'T IT? IS THIS HOW YOU GOT IN? THE DAY RUDY DIED? WELL, THIS IS HOW I ALWAYS GOT IN. RUDY DIDN'T WANT GRETCHEN TO KNOW WE WERE TALKING. OKAY, I THINK WE SHOULD SPLIT UP. THAT IS A TERRIBLE IDEA. WHY DON'T YOU CHECK THE KITCHEN? DO YOU HAVE YOUR PHONE? YEAH, WHY? TURN ON THE RECORDER. TRY TO GET HER TO SAY SHE WAS HERE THAT DAY. WHERE IS RUDY'S WINE CLOSET? UH, DOWN THE HALL, BY THE BEDROOM. OKAY. TESTING. TESTING. SO, DO YOU... DID YOU COME HERE OFTEN? UH... BILLIE! BILLIE! BILLIE! WE JUST FOUND A... WHAT IS THAT? WHAT IS HAPPENING? KIKI? SOMEBODY MUST HAVE FOLLOWED US. SHE DIDN'T SAY WHERE SHE WAS GOING? I'M NOT HER BABYSITTER. LOOK, GUYS, WE CAN DO THIS HERE, OR I CAN TAKE ALL THREE OF YOU DOWN TO THE STATION. I THINK WE FOUND HER. NOBODY CAME IN. I'VE BEEN AT THIS DESK ALL NIGHT. I JUST NEED THE KEYS. POLICE! COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP. KEEP TRYING, KEEP TRYING. I CANNOT GET A SIGNAL! OH, MY GOD. WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? WHERE'S KIKI? KIKI? IS SHE DEAD? WHAT HAPPENED? I'M CALLING AN AMBULANCE. NO, PLEASE DON'T. YOU PROBABLY HAVE A CONCUSSION. I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET IN TROUBLE. OH, DON'T WORRY. SHE'S ALREADY IN TROUBLE. WE DIDN'T BREAK IN. I HAD A KEY. WE WERE JUST LOOKING FOR THE RECORDING... OF RUDY'S KILLER. TIFFANY FOUND A GUN. I SENT HER TO GET BILLIE. THAT'S THE LAST THING I REMEMBER. HOLD ON. IT WAS THERE. WHY WOULDN'T THE POLICE HAVE TAKEN IT WHEN THEY SEARCHED RUDY'S APARTMENT? THE GUN WAS REGISTERED TO RUDY. PURCHASED LEGALLY, AND IT WASN'T RELATED TO THE CASE. CAN YOU FOLLOW ME? I NEED TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING. A RECORDING? OF RUDY'S MURDERER? OKAY, I MIGHT HAVE BENT THE TRUTH A LITTLE, BUT I'M PRETTY SURE I JUST FIGURED OUT WHO DID THIS. I JUST NEED TWO HOURS. JUST GIVE ME TWO HOURS TO PROVE IT. IT'S NOT YOUR JOB TO PROVE IT, AND THE MORE YOU TRY, THE MORE GUILTY YOU LOOK. I DIDN'T RANSACK THIS APARTMENT, AND I COULDN'T HAVE KNOCKED KIKI OUT. I WAS LOCKED IN THIS CLOSET. WHY DID YOU COME HERE? YOU SENT ME A TEXT. I DIDN'T SEND YOU A TEXT. I LEFT MY PHONE AT THE RESTAURANT. WHY'D YOU GO TO PHIL NARDI'S HOUSE? HE SENT ME A TEXT TELLING ME TO COME OVER. PHIL SAID YOU SENT HIM A TEXT. SOMEONE IS TRYING TO FRAME ME, AND THEY WERE HERE, IN THIS APARTMENT. I JUST NEED TWO HOURS. THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING. LET'S GO. WHAT ABOUT THE POLICE OFFICER? HE'S LETTING US LEAVE? WE REALLY DON'T HAVE TIME TO TALK ABOUT THIS. WHY AREN'T WE PICKING HER UP? THE PERSON WHO KILLED RUDY SLATER LOCKED BILLIE AND TIFFANY MOON IN A WINE CLOSET AND TRASHED RUDY'S APARTMENT. THEY WERE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING. IF WE LET BILLIE GO, THEY'LL FOLLOW HER. WHY? SAME REASON THEY TRIED TO KILL PHIL NARDI... KEEP HER FROM FINDING EVIDENCE. I HOPE SHE HASN'T BRAINWASHED YOU WITH HER MAGIC FOOD. WHERE ARE WE GOING? PHIL'S HOUSE. I NEED TO SEE THE RECORDING. TIFFANY COULDN'T HAVE DONE THIS. SHE WAS LOCKED IN A CLOSET. MAYBE SHE HAS A HELPER. LANCE. IS EVERYTHING OKAY? YEAH, EVERYTHING'S FINE. COME ON. BABY. DON'T LET ME DOWN. WHAT DO I WIN IF YOU'RE WRONG? PHIL MIGHT NOT BE HAPPY TO SEE YOU. I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE. WAIT HERE. I'LL BE BACK. I'M SO SORRY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. YOU KNOW THE POLICE TOLD ME TO CALL THEM IF YOU TRIED TO CONTACT ME. I JUST NEED FIVE MINUTES, PLEASE. LOOK, I KNOW WHO KILLED LANIE AND RUDY, BUT I CAN'T PROVE IT WITHOUT YOUR HELP. ALL RIGHT. COME ON. MAYBE HE FORGAVE HER. MAYBE. PHIL'S LAPTOP WAS DESTROYED IN THE FIRE, BUT WE CAN ACCESS THE RECORDING FROM RUDY'S COMPUTER AT WORK. KIKI AND I WILL GO IN THE BACK. YOU DISTRACT THE GUARD. I'M NOT A VERY GOOD ACTRESS. YOU'LL DO FINE. WHY DID YOU SEND HER AWAY? SO WE HAVE TIME TO LOOK AT THE DEMO. BUT WHAT IF LANCE FOLLOWED US? I DON'T THINK HE DID. I'M GOING IN. CALL PHIL NARDI. MAKE HIM GIVE YOU NAMES, ALL RIGHT? EVERYONE THAT AUDITIONED FOR THAT CO-HOST JOB... PHIL NARDI SENT A VIDEO. OKAY, I'M GOING TO NEED THE PASSWORD TO RUDY'S COMPUTER TO GET INTO IT. I CAN'T HELP YOU. NOT THIS TIME. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? COULD YOU DROP THE NICE ACT FOR TWO MINUTES? ISN'T THAT WHY YOU BROUGHT ME HERE? TO CONFRONT ME WITH MY DEMO, MAKE ME CONFESS? I DIDN'T WANT IT TO BE TRUE. WHY? IS IT SO HARD TO BELIEVE THAT I COULD DO LANIE'S JOB? FOR YOUR INFORMATION, I RAN THE TV STATION AT MY COLLEGE. I DID EVERYTHING. EDITING, PRODUCING, TALENT... WHEN RUDY MET ME, HE SAID I WAS EVEN BETTER THAN LANIE BECAUSE I'M SMART. SO I CAME HERE, AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED WHEN HE SAW MY DEMO? HE LAUGHED. HE SAID IF I WANTED LANIE'S JOB, I WOULD HAVE TO BUY MY OWN NETWORK. LANIE WOULD NEVER RETIRE. SO YOU POISONED HER. THAT RAT POISON WAS 60 YEARS OLD. I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD WORK. WHERE DID YOU GET IT? I FOUND IT IN THE BARN WHEN I WENT HOME OVER CHRISTMAS. KIKI, YOU'RE SO TALENTED. YOU COULD HAVE SUCCEEDED IN SO MANY OTHER WAYS. THAT'S EASY FOR YOU TO SAY. YOU WERE RUDY'S PET. HE GAVE YOU EVERYTHING, AND HE KEPT GIVING YOU MORE, EVEN THOUGH YOU DIDN'T DESERVE IT. SO YOU FRAMED ME BECAUSE YOU WERE ANGRY. I WASN'T ANGRY. YOU JUST MADE IT SO EASY. "KIKI, CAN YOU CHECK MY SCHEDULE? SEND FLOWERS TO THAT GUEST? FIND MY CAR KEYS?" SO THAT'S HOW YOU GOT INTO THE RESTAURANT, PLANTED THE CAKE AND THE RAT POISON. THAT'S HOW I DID IT ALL. YOU WERE SO HELPFUL. KEYS, PASSWORDS, CREDIT CARDS... I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS. YOU SHOULD PAY MORE ATTENTION. PEOPLE IN TELEVISION DON'T HAVE FRIENDS. I'M GOING TO READ THE CLOSE OF THE SHOW, WHERE WE WISH EVERYONE A GREAT DAY AND WELCOME THEM TO WAKE UP WITH US AGAIN TOMORROW. UH, WELL, THAT'S... THAT'S LANIE'S PART SO YOU SHOULD READ ONE YOU COULD GET. YOU DON'T THINK I CAN DO LANIE'S JOB? NO, I'M JUST SAYING THAT SHE'S BEEN HERE FOR, LIKE, 10 YEARS, SO SHE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE. OH... WELL, I DON'T THINK SHE'LL BE AROUND MUCH LONGER, AND RUDY PROMISED THE JOB TO ME. THERE'S OUR MYSTERY HOST. THAT'S ONE WAY. THE POLICE FOLLOWED US. IF YOU SHOOT ME, THEY'LL FIND YOU. I'LL TELL THEM YOU SHOT YOURSELF... OUT OF GUILT. I TRIED TO STOP YOU. TRAGICALLY, I FAILED. THEY'LL NEVER BELIEVE YOU, NOT AFTER THEY SEE THAT DEMO. OH, THAT DEMO DOESN'T PROVE A THING! THAT'S WHAT I SAID TO RUDY. "SAYING SOMEONE MIGHT LEAVE THE SHOW DOESN'T MAKE YOU A MURDERER." BUT SAYING YOU KILLED THEM DOES. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? SHOOT ME, TOO? COME ON! I'LL TAKE THE STUDIO. OKAY. MMPH! SHH... I WOULDN'T RUN. COULD MAKE GREAT TV. I'M SORRY. GO. IT TOOK A WHILE TO GET US HERE, BUT I'M SO GLAD WE'RE ALL AT THE SAME TABLE. YOU KNOW, A VERY WISE MAN ONCE SAID, WHEN YOU BREAK BREAD WITH SOMEONE, YOU MAKE THEM YOUR FRIEND. TO RUDY, FOR MAKING US FRIENDS. TO RUDY. AND TO BILLIE. WELCOME BACK. OH, THANK YOU. AND I'M GLAD WE TALKED TIFFANY INTO STAYING. AND BILLIE... UM... RUDY MEANT A LOT TO ME, AND WHEN I THOUGHT THAT YOU... WELL, LOOK, WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS... I SHOULDN'T HAVE FIRED YOU. I'M SORRY. APOLOGY ACCEPTED. OKAY, NO MORE TALKING. LET'S EAT. THIS SMELLS AMAZING. AH, DELICIOUS. OH, MAN, THIS IS FANTASTIC. WHAT IS THIS? IT'S TURNIP. MWAH! EXCUSE ME. HEY. THANKS FOR THE INVITE. WHY DON'T YOU COME INSIDE? THE LAST TIME I SAW YOUR AUNT CASSANDRA AND MAURICE, THEY WERE PRETTY UPSET. WELL, YOU DID TRY TO ARREST ME. I THINK I SHOULD GET A FEW POINTS FOR LETTING YOU WALK AWAY FROM RUDY'S APARTMENT. AND FOR EXPLAINING THAT CAN OF CYANIDE THAT WAS IN MAURICE'S CAR TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY. HOW DID YOU KNOW IT WAS KIKI? WHEN WE WERE AT RUDY'S APARTMENT, I ASKED WHERE RUDY'S WINE CLOSET WAS, AND SHE TOLD ME, WITHOUT ASKING WHY, WHICH IS STRANGE, GIVEN ALL THE QUESTIONS SHE USUALLY ASKS. IT WAS AS IF SHE ALREADY KNEW, AND THEN WE GOT LOCKED IN, AND THEN I STARTED THINKING ABOUT OCCAM'S RAZOR, THE SIMPLEST EXPLANATION. WHO HAD ACCESS TO ALL THAT INFORMATION... CREDIT CARDS, EMAILS, KEYS, SCHEDULES? KIKI. YEAH. SHE'S SMART... JUST LIKE RUDY SAID... AND SHE MADE HERSELF INDISPENSABLE. SHE HAD THE EXPERTISE TO HACK YOUR PHONE AND SEND SPOOF TEXTS. OCCAM'S RAZOR. I'M PRETTY SURE THAT PUTS ANOTHER POINT IN MY FAVOR... WHICH MEANS, TECHNICALLY, I GET A FRESH START. WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY. A GOOD DESSERT MAKES ANYTHING POSSIBLE. YOU WANT TO COME IN FOR SOME CELEBRATION CAKE? CAKE? WHAT ARE WE CELEBRATING? TEAMWORK. I LIKE IT. SO DO I. COME ON.
