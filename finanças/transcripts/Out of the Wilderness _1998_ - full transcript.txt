[chimes ringing] [wind howling] [light orchestral music] - [Clint] Nature teaches us wondrous lessons about ourselves. It is often full of surprises. This is a tale of one of its little known heroes, a trickster called the raven. Scholars label it the brains of the bird world. It is so clever, social and adaptable that it's almost human. We can learn from this raven. Often it is just a question of watching and waiting. We never know what might happen. [grand orchestral music] [light orchestral music] [light orchestral music] - [Matt] With your morning cup of coffee, Matt McCord on FM 94, KJOX. It's another glorious, sunny day in the Rose City. We're waiting and watching with the rest of the nation and all its animals for today's controversial raven hearing at the Department of the Interior. Millionaire buckskin lawyer, Clint Dugan is in town to defend animal rights and the little girl, Melissa, whose pet bird, Blackfeather, has been held by the Feds for mischievous conduct. Now that's a real jailbird for ya. [typewriter keys clacking] Judge Battle has ordered a media blackout, but our inside sources will keep us posted. Hey, that's our topic. Do we have a caller? Caller, you're on the air with Mad Matt in the Morning. [line beeping] - [Woman] I don't get it. Spotted owls, ravens. Hey, why don't they stay in the woods where they belong? Why waste our time and money on these loony animals that don't belong in our backyards. [line beeping] - [Matt] Right, maybe we need public enemies. Might as well go after the bears, cougars, and ravens that can't defend themselves. Next caller, you're on line three, go ahead, 94 FM. [suspenseful orchestral music] [breathing heavily] - Mr. Dugan? - Mr. Carey, I presume. - Uh, I'm, I'm sorry I'm late. I had, I had a little problem with the bike. Oh, I'll be dressed in a second. - Well, the great Clint Dugan. I heard you might show up. - Why, hello, Morgan. Didn't expect to see you here. - Well, catch up on the news and I'll see you inside. - Good luck to you, Morgan. - Keep your luck, counselor, you're gonna need it. - What was that all about? - Trouble. Why didn't you warn me? - Well, I, I, she was a last minute substitution from San Francisco. Who is she, anyway? - An enforcer for the Ninth Circuit. Someone high up wants to win this case. - Are you worried? [laughing] Well, 'cause if, you know, if, if you're worried, then, you know, I'm worried. - Are we all right, then? - Patty, Melissa, Ray, I want you to meet Mr. Clint Dugan. - Thank you, Mr. Dugan, for coming. We need you. - Well, actually, you're in pretty good hands with Dan Carey here. I'm just along to help out a little bit. Hello, Melissa. It's nice to meet you. - I knew you'd come. - Somehow I didn't think you'd show. One of the most famous lawyers in the country, I didn't think you'd care about us. - The only way to get him to stop calling me. He must've called me 100 times, telling me about a mysterious raven who saved lives and the young girl who loved the rare bird. Very intriguing. - Well, thanks, Mr. Dugan. She really loves that bird. - Thank you. - Hmm. - [Woman] All rise. Court is now in session, the Honorable Judge Emmett G. Battle, presiding. - Good morning ladies and gentlemen, please be seated. - Good morning, Your Honor. - We're assembled for the administrative hearing in the matter of the Department of the Interior versus Talbot and Blackfeather, et al. The same rules apply here as in open court. Is that understood? This is a closed hearing. I barred the press to keep this matter from becoming a zoo. I'm not interested in publicity. I'm interested in upholding the law. Now I direct you to Proverbs 28:4. - Buckle up, here we go. - "Anyone who turns a deaf ear to the law, "even his prayers are detestable." Now let that be your guidepost for this proceeding. Is the government ready, Miss Brown? - We are, Your Honor. - And the defense? - Clint Dugan for the defense, Your Honor. I believe you know Dan Carey, the defense attorney of record. Yes, I know Mr. Carey. And I know who you are, Mr. Dugan. Is the defense ready to proceed? - Frankly, Your Honor, I don't see how we can. The most important party to these proceedings is not present. - And who might that be, Mr. Dugan? - Why, Blackfeather, of course. The raven who stands to lose his life in these proceedings. Under the Constitution, the defendant is entitled to face his accusers in a court of law. [scoffing] - Objection, Your Honor, this is a bird, not a person. - Counselor, it is not a bird, it is a raven. A distinction, which we will show, is very important to our defense. - Your Honor, Mr. Dugan's request is completely out of line. He mocks the court with this capricious attempt to shift the focus from the material facts of this case. - I assure you I could not be more serious. This raven has been incarcerated for 13 months and kept away from his family. Now, if Your Honor does not wish to see years of appeals, the raven must be present. - Don't threaten me, Mr. Dugan. Is the raven here? - Uh, yes, Your Honor. Fish and Game have him downstairs. - [Emmett] Well let's bring him up here ASAP. - Your Honor, I, uh, I know of no precedent where, uh, for animals-- - [Emmett] Are you questioning me, Mr. Smith? - Uh, no, Your Honor. I'll get the raven right away, Your Honor. - In the meantime, can we proceed, if there are no further objections? Are there any, Mr. Dugan? - Not at this time, Your Honor. - [Emmett] Oh, good. All right, Miss Brown, proceed. - Thank you, Your Honor. In the matter of the Department of the Interior versus Talbot, Blackfeather, et al, the following charges have been filed against the defendants. One, through wanton and reckless trespass, the bird named Blackfeather companioned by the Talbot family, has directly, or indirectly, caused several serious accidents endangering human lives. Thus, said bird is deemed to be a public nuisance and must be destroyed. Two, resulting from said bird's actions, a considerable amount of gold ore has been removed from Federal land illegally and it has been found to be in the possession of the Talbot family. - Do you understand the charges against you? How do you plead? - Not guilty, Your Honor. - The Government calls Melissa Talbot. [Blackfeather caws] [light orchestral music] - Blackfeather! Judge, may I please say hello to him? Please? - [Emmett] Very well, but let's make it fast. [light orchestral music] [Blackfeather caws] - Hey, Blackfeather, how are you? [Blackfeather caws] Hey cutie, I missed you. - Okay, let's not make this more of a distraction than necessary. [Blackfeather caws] [Blackfeather caws] Now Melissa, you can testify from right there. Raise your right hand, please. Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? - I do. - State your full name and your age. - Melissa Ann Talbot, I'm 13-years-old. - Hi, Melissa. Are you comfortable? Do you need any water? You're kind of nervous, huh? That's okay. All I want you to do is just tell everybody here, in your own words, how all of this got started. [chimes ringing] [wind howling] - [Melissa] There was a raven who had a home not far from our home. And even though it flew over our place almost every day, no one ever noticed it except me. [light orchestral music] [raven caws] The raven had a nest with a baby, high in a tree. That baby was Blackfeather. [raven caws] - Melissa! Melissa? Melissa? - What? - [Ray] I'm calling and calling, it's like you can't hear me. I need some more nails. - [Melissa] Where are they? - [Ray] They're right down by the door to the basement. - [Melissa] All right, I'm coming. [exhaling] [raven caws] - [Ray] Come on, Melissa, keep it moving. Time is money. We don't get paid for daydreaming. - It's the same one. - Same what? - Same raven. Every time it flies by it makes that same funny call. It's like grandma with a bad cough. It's weird. - [Ray] Is that right? - [Melissa] I wonder why he's always hanging around here. - I want you to get the paint and work on the sign again. - I knew you were gonna say that. - [Ray] Well, we've got to get it finished. The sooner, the better. I want you to keep an eye on the llamas, they've been straying lately. You hear me? [helicopter whirring] [raven caws] [ominous orchestral music] - [Melissa] There was danger everywhere in the wilderness, from both predators and man. As Blackfeather's mother soon found out. [suspenseful orchestral music] [bird thudding] Because we lived so far out, people rarely stopped by to see us. And they never came in helicopters. So that should have been all the more reason to be excited about this visit. But for some reason, these smiling visitors made me feel uneasy, especially the one in the hat. - Hey, Ray, how are you? Good to see you again. - [Ray] You too, how you doing? - Good. - Hi, George. - Hi. - You made a lot of progress here, I see. - Yeah. - So you're still glad you moved up here, then? - Well there's no turning back now. [chuckling] - I see you've got yourself a little helper since school got out. - [Ray] And Melissa, get back to work, okay? - How's Patty? - Ah, the wife's working in town, now. It's been harder than I thought. I hope to have the place up and running before fall, though, if I can scrape together enough money. She should be home soon. You guys want to come in for a cup of coffee? - No, that's okay, that's okay, Ray, thanks. I got a lot lined up today. I just wanted to swing by up here, and warn you about a grizzly that's been shot in this area, it's wounded. It's probably a sow with cubs. The hunter couldn't get off another shot before it attacked. He got chewed up pretty bad. - [Ray] Geez. - The doctors don't even think he's gonna make it so you just report in to us if you see anything suspicious. Why don't you get a phone up here so I can give you a call. - Yeah. - All right? Okay. Oh, by the way, I hit a raven on the way up here. Yeah, the darn things usually get out of the way, you know what I mean? [chuckling] - Hey John, you should be careful about those ravens. They bring us bad luck. - Now George, that's all stories, superstition, you know that. Ray, we'll see you later. - Oh yeah, thanks for coming. - You keep your eyes open. - Will do. - [Melissa] That was the day I learned that Blackfeather became an orphan. - [George] John, don't make fun of those ravens. - [John] Now George, now don't worry about it. I told you they're stories and superstition. You got nothing to worry about. [John laughing] - [Ray] Melissa, that's coming along. - [Melissa] Do you like it? - The T's kind of big, but... [helicopter whirring] Come on, you can help me clear some branches. - Don't you want me to finish? - Nah, first I want to finish cutting the logs for the third tourist cabin. Otherwise that sign's not gonna do us any good. - [Melissa] Daddy never wasted time saying please when asking me to help him. In fact, he never asked me to do anything. He just ordered. - [Ray] Come on. - [Melissa] I was probably the only kid in America who looked forward to going back to school. - Now that's one of the trees I tagged last winter. - [Melissa] That's a big tree. - [Ray] There's enough lumber in that one to frame a new cabin. [light orchestral music] [chainsaw whirring] [Blackfeather caws] - I was sure it was the raven's nest, and daddy was going to destroy it. I had to tell him. Daddy, daddy, there's a nest. - Melissa, get back, get back now. Go! [suspenseful orchestral music] [Ray grunting] Melissa! [Melissa grunting] - [Melissa] Daddy! [Melissa screaming] [tree thudding] [suspenseful orchestral music] - Melissa? [Melissa groaning] Melissa! Melissa! Melissa, are you okay? Melissa! No, no, no, no! [screaming] Melissa? Melissa! - [Melissa] The nest, daddy. The nest. - The nest? [Blackfeather caws] It's okay, honey. It's right here. It's right by your leg. It's okay. It's okay. Chainsaw. The chainsaw. [grunting] I'll be back honey, I'm going to get help. [Ray screaming] [truck crashing] [electricity crackling] [Ray grunting] [grunting] [grunting] [suspenseful orchestral music] - [DJ] A little warming trend this afternoon, a chance of showers later-- [radio tuning] [light rock music] - [Ray] Patty! - What in heaven's name? - [Ray] It's Melissa, she's pinned under a tree. I pray to God we can save her while there's still time. - Oh my God. - [Ray] My other chainsaw's in the back. Let's go. [chainsaw whirring] - Melissa, can you hear me? Ray, I got her. I got her. [Blackfeather caws] You're gonna be okay, you're gonna be okay. Melissa, can you hear me? Can you hear me? [dramatic orchestral music] [Patty sobbing] - Three weeks later I came home from the hospital. And I still couldn't move my legs. The doctors weren't sure that I would ever be able to walk again. I was glad to have a new friend to cheer me up. He was kind of noisy and he ate all the time, but that didn't matter much. He was always making mom and me laugh. Mom, I think he's ready. - [Patty] Okay, honey. [Blackfeather caws] - [Melissa] He's gonna like this. - [Patty] I hope it's not too cold. - [Melissa] Come on, come on. [both laughing] - [Patty] He really is cute. - You gotta see this. - Yeah, yeah, let, let me get the phone hooked up. - [Melissa] Daddy, he's gonna quit doing it. [Patty laughing] - Mom, I want to get out. I think the raven does too. - [Patty] Oh, that sounds like a good idea, honey. The sun will do you some good. Ray, could you help? - [Ray] Patty, I got to get back to work. - Please, Ray. [Blackfeather caws] - [Ray] All right. - Thank you, daddy. - [Ray] Yeah, don't mention it. - [Melissa] My father's dislike of the raven got worse. He seemed angry and distant toward me and mom. I just kept hoping I'd get better so he'd stop being mad all the time. Mom, on the other hand, grew to like raven more and more. I think she knew how important this friendship was to me. Mom, this is good. - [Patty] Call when you want to come in. - Thanks, mom. [light orchestral music] [Blackfeather chirping] The raven had become my very best friend. I think he somehow understood what I was going through, you know, with daddy not really loving me and all. [Blackfeather caws] The raven, on the other hand, was always showing me that he loved me, no matter what. Hey, that tickles. [ominous orchestral music] Don't go far. You can't fly yet. [sighing] [suspenseful orchestral music] No! Mom! No, no! No! No! Get away! No! Mom! [screaming] Mom! Mom! Mom! [screaming] Get away! Mom! Get away! Mom! Awwww! [fox whimpering] - Melissa, Melissa! [Blackfeather caws] - [Melissa] The fox attack had really scared me. First, because I'd almost lost my best friend, and I couldn't bear the thought of that. And second, because I'd hurt myself even more when I fell out of my wheelchair. Things just seemed to be getting worse and worse. Except for my raven's appetite, of course. It just got better and better. He never seemed to let anything bother him. Almost like he knew. - [Patty] Melissa? - [Melissa] Hi, mom. [Blackfeather caws] - [Patty] How are you feeling? - I named him Blackfeather. - [Patty] Blackfeather? - He responds to it, too. It's better than going glock-glock all the time. - [Patty] Good night, sleep well. - [Melissa] Good night, mom, Love you. [dramatic orchestral music] [footsteps approaching] - How's she doing? - Well, it wouldn't hurt if you spent a little more time with her. That way you'd know how she's doing. - Are you gonna let her keep that stupid bird? I'm finding bird doo-doo all over the place. The darn thing stinks. - That bird has a name. She named it Blackfeather. - [Ray] Yeah. - That raven keeps her from worrying about herself, Ray. I want her to be put back in the hospital. She hurt herself again today when she fell. - [Ray] We're broke. I can't even pay for the existing medical bills. - [Patty] I just pray to God that she won't be permanently paralyzed. - Yeah. - You've always been selfish. I thought that when you married me, that you'd accepted Melissa as your own daughter. But instead you treat her like some hired hand, like your own personal grunt. She needs to be allowed to be a child, too. - [Melissa] I think it was the first big fight my parents ever really had. I'd never seen my mom get mad about anything before. But being an amateur didn't seem to matter to her, 'cause it was real obvious who lost. [Blackfeather caws] - [Patty] Hi, Sandra. [Blackfeather caws] - Bye, daddy. I'll be back soon. I just, I just know I will. By the time I get back, Blackfeather will think you're his mommy instead of me. - Well, I think he'll remember. And like you said, you'll be back soon. - [Melissa] It had to be one of the worst days of my life. I ached from head to toe and I was going back to the hospital. My father would barely speak to me, and I had to leave Blackfeather behind. You could say I was a little depressed. - [Patty] Goodbye, Ray. I'll try and call when I can. [Blackfeather caws] - [Melissa] Goodbye, daddy. Leaving Blackfeather with my father was the hardest thing to do. 'Cause I knew how much he didn't like the raven, but daddy had promised me he'd take care of him. So I figured everything would be okay. Guess I should have found out exactly what he meant by take care of. [Blackfeather caws] - Get lost, I fed you an hour ago. Beat it. [light orchestral music] You just never give up, do you? Want some more? [Blackfeather caws] Hey what's my payback, huh? [grunting] [elevator dinging] - [Nurse] Patty. Hi, Patty. - [Patty] Hi. - Listen, Melissa's all settled into her bed now. She's fine for now. The doctor wants to run a series of X-rays. This will give us a crystal clear picture of the exact extent of nerve damage that Melissa has suffered. - So we should know by tomorrow if she'll be all right then? Her chances are good, aren't they? - I hope so. [dramatic orchestral music] - [Melissa] The doctor made everything sound kinda hopeless, the way doctors can sometimes do. And mom didn't take it too well. That day is not one of my better memories. [telephone ringing] - [Ray] Hi, this is Ray Talbot. Leave a message. [answering machine beeping] - [Patty] Ray, I just talked to Melissa's doctor. She's not doing well at all. Ray, there's a 50-50 chance she'll never walk again. She may be in the hospital 60 to 90 days. Please call the hospital. I need to talk to you. I know the costs will be hard to handle. Bye. [phone clicking] - [Melissa] One of daddy's most endearing habits was the way he blamed everybody and everything else for his own mistakes. So, who could be surprised when he put all the blame for this mess on Blackfeather. [dramatic orchestral music] Not a day went by that I didn't think about Blackfeather and daddy. In a book about ravens which Nurse Blakely gave me, it said, among other things, how adult ravens were playful to the point of mischievous and that they loved to pluck bright and shiny objects. This sort of made me worry. Blackfeather would be almost full grown by now and I couldn't see daddy's quick temper and a playful feathered pack rat being a very good combination, even in the best of times. [light orchestral music] [Blackfeather caws] [Blackfeather caws] - Pencil, pencil. I can't find anything. [upbeat orchestral music] All right, you played your little joke. Give it to me. I'm gonna count to three. One. Two. You feathered maggot. [Blackfeather chirps] [Blackfeather caws] [quirky orchestral music] [Blackfeather caws] You! [ominous orchestral music] Get out! Go on, get out! Go on! Beat it! [quirky orchestral music] Not my nails! Drop it! This is it. I've had it. [Blackfeather caws] [Blackfeather chirps] Huh? Not my cigarette. Why you! Drop it! Gimme that! Drop it! [grunting] No! [shed exploding] That was my last cigarette. What the... [suspenseful orchestral music] Where are you? Come on out! [growling] [light orchestral music] [Blackfeather caws] - [Melissa] Finally, daddy's curious behavior caused the raven to look for other forms of entertainment. He left the homestead for long periods to explore the wilderness, make new discoveries, and face other dangers. Shiny things always caught Blackfeather's eye and when he saw a gold nugget in the stream, he just couldn't resist, no matter what the danger. [ominous orchestral music] [wolf growling] [wolf whimpering] [light orchestral music] Always ready to forgive, Blackfeather returned home time and again, because home was where he was happiest. Unlike the raven, my father rarely forgave and he never forgot. Unknown to any of us, Blackfeather had a secret place all his own. A place he could decorate with all the sparkling treasures he collected. A place he could go to escape daddy's temper tantrums. A throne from which he could view his kingdom in perfect safety. It wasn't part of the plan that daddy should find this place, however, so Blackfeather decided to undecorate very quickly. - What's the matter? Cat got your tongue? Got something to hide? Huh? [Blackfeather chirps] [Blackfeather caws] [gun firing] [suspenseful orchestral music] [gun firing] [gun firing] - [Melissa] Firing the shotgun seemed to drain the rage out of my father. A little voice within him grew louder and louder and he began to regret letting his temper get the best of him. Especially when he discovered one of his pot shots may have hit Blackfeather. [dramatic orchestral music] After the shooting incident, Blackfeather chose to make the hollow tree his new home. Only trouble was, all his beautiful shiny things were way down inside the tree. Obviously, a major redecorating effort was in order. [grunting] During one of his outings, the raven decided to make a detour into our yard. As I said before, he was a very forgiving raven. - Now what are you up to? - [Melissa] The sight of those shiny lug nuts helped Blackfeather to forgive even faster. [quirky orchestral music] Caught up in the excitement of finding a bright new plaything, the raven let his guard down. For a brief and uncharacteristic moment, daddy remembered the promise he had made me, which was just enough time for Blackfeather to exchange one toy for another while making a spectacular escape. Blackfeather never understood why my father got so mad whenever they were playing games. [phone ringing] - Department of Fish and Game, Holt speaking. - Hi, John, it's Ray Talbot. John, I've got a little problem. Actually, it's a, a raven, my little girl raised it as a pet, and frankly, [sighing] this thing is ruining my life. - Oh, come on, Ray. A raven? Come on. - No, now this raven is more dangerous than any wounded grizzly bear. That thing hospitalized my daughter, all right? It caused me to wreck my truck, almost another one nearly killed me, blew up my garage, stole half my silverware, God knows what else. And now it's got my truck keys! All right, now doggone it, John, you've gotta help me. - Ravens are a varmint. Shoot it. - I tried that. That's not an option anymore. Look, you're Fish and Game, can't you just confiscate it or something? - Well, technically, ravens are classified as migratory birds. And legally, you ought to have a license before keeping one in captivity. Hang on a second. - That's it, that's it. I don't have any permits. - Well is it caged, Mr. Talbot? - For Pete's sake, John, just, come and get it, all right, before this place looks like a war zone. - Okay, well just catch it and I'll come up there later today. [Blackfeather caws] - [Ray] Where are you? Come on out. [Blackfeather chirping] - [Melissa] The raven, of course, sensed that daddy was up to something. But the sight of polished silverware was just too much to resist. [quirky orchestral music] - [Ray] That's it. [grunting] [suspenseful orchestral music] [suspenseful orchestral music] [light orchestral music] Yes! Ha-ha-ha, woo! - [Melissa] This time it looked like daddy had finally won the game. Only daddy wasn't playing a game. And by the time Blackfeather figured this out, he was in a whole lot of trouble. - You know what they say, Ray. Don't screw with mother nature. - So, what are you gonna do with him when you get him back to town? Twist his head off? - Unfortunately, not right away. No. It just so happens, there's a TV personality coming into town in a couple of days. He's part of a remote live broadcast, a news magazine. He called the department the other day. Said he was looking for tame, orphaned animals to use in his broadcast. So, we'll let him use the bird. And then I'll dispose of it. - One less headache for me. - Whatever. I'll see you around, Ray. [laughing] [engine revving] - [Ray] What a relief. - But it wasn't a relief to Blackfeather. Being put in a box and all. He didn't know what to expect. It turned out to be just the first time that Fish and Game took Blackfeather away. The trouble really started when Blackfeather went into town. [dramatic news jingle] - [Announcer] Up next, KNK's live news hour. The show that takes you someplace new every day. - [Woman] You can do it. Come here. He doesn't like this. - Come on, there's eight million people watching this show. - [Woman] Come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on. - [Terrence] Hold still. - [Woman] Come on, come on. - [Terrence] Ow, ow! - [Man] Come on. - Four, three, two. - Ladies and gentlemen, we are excited to be broadcasting live outside of Anchorage, Alaska in this beautiful and very unpredictable weather. One of our guests is now making his arrival. And welcome Terrence and his pet raven, Blackfeather. That's wonderful. - [Terrence] Thanks, Debbie. Ow, ow! - Wow! - [Terrence] This is a North American, ow. - That's, you all right? - [Terrence] North American raven it's found here in Alaska and in northern Canada. [Blackfeather caws] Ravens are considered sacred by many cultures worldwide. And many native people in the north believe these to be endowed with supernatural powers. - [Debbie] Is that right? - [Terrence] They can be very affectionate and they can bring good luck to people they decide to like. Whoa, Whoa, Whoa! - A beautiful bird. - [Terrence] Whoa, whoa! There you go, ow! - [Debbie] Is it something you said? - [Terrence] Well, I guess so. Geez, you know they have incredible memories. They're considered to have the IQ of a 10-year-old. - Larry, ow! - [Terrence] Whoa, whoa, whoa. - [Debbie] Get it away from me! [screaming] Get that thing away. - Go to commercial, now! - Somebody help! Larry! Ugh! This is a fiasco! Brilliant idea, Larry. You know I almost got my eye pecked out up there? - You were sensational. [Debbie screaming] Our viewership is gonna pull through the roof. [light orchestral music] [Blackfeather caws] - [Melissa] While Blackfeather wasn't one to hold grudges, he was certainly able to learn from his experiences. He hadn't like that cage, or the rough way those people had handled him, so he wouldn't allow himself to be caught again. He realized how important his freedom was, only after he had lost it. [dramatic orchestral music] But his nature was friendly and forgiving. And just because daddy had put him in a box, didn't mean all humans would try to do so. Being selective was the key. Being selective and having pretty toys. [dog barking] - [Annie] Ahh. Come back. Come back, birdie. [dog barking] Give me my toy back. - Annie? Annie! Annie! [dog barking] Annie! Annie! Annie! Annie! - [Annie] Give me my toy. [all shouting] - [Woman] Watch the road, watch the road! Don't go in the ditch! [shouting] [woman shouting] - [Woman] Let me outta here. [shouting] [man shouting] [suspenseful orchestral music] [RV exploding] [laughing] - Oh, Annie, thank God you're safe. - May I have a glass of water now, please? - Of course you may. So tell me, Melissa, was Blackfeather blamed for that RV accident? - He didn't do it. - I know, but was he blamed? Just yes or no. - Yes. - Objection. Badgering the witness. - [Emmett] Overruled. - Your Honor, since it is obvious the witness is tired and far from finished. I move that we continue after lunch. - Very well, counselor, if the prosecution has no objection. - No objections, Your Honor. - This hearing stands in recess until two p.m. [gavel banging] - Here you go, sweetheart. - Thank you. - You bet. Now Melissa, when you go back in there you're gonna have to testify some more. Are you gonna be okay? - Sure. - Good girl. [blowing] - [Melissa] Dan? - [Dan] Mm-hmm. - Why do they wanna hurt Blackfeather? He's just a raven. - One word, precedent. The law is based on precedent. If your raven goes unregulated then other animals, wild animals, like cougars or bears, can go unregulated. And somehow that could affect the hunting and fishing laws and that's a pretty big thing in this country. - Well, that doesn't make any sense. - Makes sense to the government. That's why we have to convince this judge to act from his heart, not just parrot the law. No pun intended. [laughing] - So, how do you think we're doing so far? - Well, so far we're helping them win their case. Now, I'm trying to access some ammunition. But this expensive doorstop here just won't cooperate. My secretary, she talked me into bringing this along. Said it would make things easier, but it just keeps fighting back. - Here, I know how to work one of those. My girlfriend has one just like it. What do you want it to do? [chuckling] - Boy, the world sure is changing. Okay. Here's what I need. [gavel banging] - All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're back in session. Let's proceed with the government's case. - That won't be necessary, Your Honor. [clearing throat] The defense stipulates to all charges. We admit the bird has been a public nuisance and that gold was taken from federal land. - Then the defense calls for a directed verdict in its favor at this point, Your Honor, because it's warranted-- - Directed verdict? - Motion is denied, Mr. Carey. I don't know what you boys are up to, but I'm not gonna let you make a joke of this hearing. - We also strenuously object to this ploy by Mr. Dugan. This stipulation exemplifies his usual courtroom prestidigitation. - Overruled, Miss Brown. I'm gonna allow the stipulation on all charges for expediency. The government's case is at rest now. And you, Mr. Dugan, I think I'm gonna give you just enough rope to hang yourself. There will be no directed verdict. If you've got something else, it better be good. - Thank you, Your Honor. The defense recalls Melissa Talbot. - [Emmett] Melissa, let me remind you that you are still under oath. - Okay, Melissa, please tell us what happened to Blackfeather, and to your family, after the RV accident. [siren wailing] - [Melissa] The predicaments the raven got himself into would have been quite funny had Blackfeather's playfulness not been misunderstood by a number of people. [quirky orchestral music] [Blackfeather caws] [Blackfeather caws] - Blanche, look at that! - Don't take that, don't take that! - I know we should have kept possession of the bird. Even the wild ones are becoming a nuisance. They're all varmints. All right, all right. Yeah, we'll take care of it immediately. Yes. Thank you for calling, sir. Right now it's over at the grocery mart on Aurora. - What are you gonna do, John? - You'll find out. - Please don't do nothing stupid. - George, do I look like I'm gonna do something stupid? [light orchestral music] - [Melissa] It wasn't long before word had spread. This odd raven was considered nothing less than a feathered terrorist. So, in the lovely human tradition of destroying what we don't understand or can't control, many felt the solution to this problem was quite simple. - The raven's got my glasses. - All right, all right, you just stay out of the way and let us take care of it. Everyone step back. Everyone step back, please step back. - Lower your aim just a little bit. - All right, sir, just step back. [gun firing] [Blackfeather caws] - John, they are federally protected. - Now you've done it, George, I won't be able to get within a mile of him. - He's joining a flock. - He's making it easy. They all roost together at the old Laughlin warehouse on Kinnick River Road. - What are you gonna do about it? - You'll find out. - I'll have nothing to do with it. - Okay George, suit yourself. [suspenseful orchestral music] - [Melissa] You could say that Officer Holt was taking this whole thing a bit personal. Blackfeather had made a fool of him, and nobody, especially a bird, was gonna get away with that. [John murmuring] [ravens cawing] [ravens cawing] Officer Holt had the county condemn the abandoned warehouse so he could carry out his plan. What he did was very stupid and very mean, but Blackfeather would outsmart him again. [shed exploding] [gun firing] [explosion booming] [suspenseful orchestral music] [Blackfeather caws] - John stop! John don't! [warehouse exploding] [George screaming] Why'd you do this? - I'm not gonna let some little black bird who's out of control make a fool out of me. This is my solution to the problem. - They don't deserve this. - Well, it's a little late now, isn't it? [chuckling] Look, back off. What I do on my own time is none of your business. - [Melissa] To George, the crime his partner had committed was the worst imaginable. His people considered the raven a creature of holiness. To destroy such a life was unthinkable. Fortunately, Holt had underestimated one member of the flock. - [George] Blackfeather. - [Melissa] I had no idea what was happening to Blackfeather, but for some reason I felt strangely sad. The doctors here said they'd done all they could for me. There had been so few options. Maybe that was what was wrong. School had started without me. And I sure miss my friends. Especially one certain friend. [children laughing] There were stories from my school friends about a mysterious raven who made regular visits to the school yard, and did some incredible things. We all knew who it was. Although Blackfeather did get into some mischief in town, he did a lot of good things that no one really knew about. - [Kid] Hey Billy, see if you can catch this. [kid laughing] [light orchestral music] [gasping] [Blackfeather caws] - [Melissa] I finally got to go home. Nothing more could be done by the people at the hospital. And that's when I began to realize that now it was up to me. I could complain about what was wrong in my life and sit around feeling sorry for myself or I could focus on the good and believe that somehow I could make it even better. It was just a matter of believing. - We really appreciate your giving us a ride home, Sandra. - I wouldn't miss this homecoming for the world. He doesn't know about it yet, does he? - Nope. ♪ Sometimes you see ♪ What's not in sight ♪ You know that everything is going to be all right ♪ ♪ It just takes hope ♪ When all seems lost ♪ To hold on to love ♪ No matter what the cost ♪ With every step ♪ You're growing strong ♪ You learn to take each fall ♪ And turn it into a song ♪ With every tear ♪ You've come so far ♪ You've realized just how strong you are ♪ - [Melissa] My homecoming was not quite what we expected. I really thought he'd be happier to see me. [dramatic orchestral music] Daddy wouldn't talk about Blackfeather's disappearance. I think he must have started to like the raven and was hurt when he flew away. I figured he was always meant to be wild, so I was happy he was where he should be. But every time I heard a raven caw I couldn't help but look up, hoping it was Blackfeather, and he'd come home. But it never was. Blackfeather never came back. And as the days passed and one season changed to another, the loneliness, and loss I felt for his leaving got buried beneath the mounting tension at home. Money worries seemed to overshadow everything. By the time the snow came, we were in danger of losing everything. Daddy went hunting caribou for food for the long winter ahead. [engine revving] [suspenseful orchestral music] [gun firing] [grunting] [engine revving] [suspenseful orchestral music] [Blackfeather caws] [Ray screaming] [wings fluttering] [gasping] [dramatic orchestral music] [keys jingling] - Blackfeather? [sighing] [Blackfeather caws] - [Melissa] How Blackfeather was able to find those keys in the wreckage is a mystery to this day. They might have been knocked loose on impact. Or perhaps his love of shiny collectables was so overpowering that picking through a fried snowmobile meant nothing to him. However he'd managed it though, it was obvious he considered them the ultimate prize. [ominous orchestral music] [wolf growling] [suspenseful orchestral music] [Ray screaming] [gasping] [suspenseful orchestral music] [Blackfeather caws] [keys jingling] Blackfeather finally came home. And he was trying to tell us something. [Blackfeather caws] Is that Blackfeather, mom? - I don't know. [keys jingling] [dog whimpering] What on earth? That's Ray's! [suspenseful orchestral music] Come on, come on. - It was sure lucky that Miss Blakely came over that day to show us her sled dogs. After mom and Miss Blakely helped me into the dog sled we took off to find daddy. We were scared that something terrible had happened. We followed daddy's snowmobile trail as far as we could. And when the trail disappeared, Blackfeather led the way. [Blackfeather caws] Follow him. Follow him. [dog barking] That's it, come on. There he is, there he is! - [Patty] Whoa, whoa boys! Whoa! - [Melissa] Daddy! - [Patty] That's it. - [Melissa] Daddy! Daddy, Daddy. - [Patty] Ray. Ray. - I thought I saw, I, I, [dogs barking] I thought I saw Blackfeather. - [Sandra] Come on guys! Yaa! [dogs barking] - [Melissa] We were so happy to find daddy okay. And Blackfeather had come back. But there was still something in store for us that day. Something we'd never forget. [dogs barking] [dramatic orchestral music] - Stop, stop, stop. - Whoa, whoa! Ray, what is it? - [Ray] There's a spoon in that tree back there. - [Sandra] Oh, I see it. - [Melissa] Hey, I see it, too. - [Sandra] It's more than a spoon. - [Melissa] Sandra, look up there. [light orchestral music] - [Patty] It's my necklace. I don't believe it. - What are you doing? - [Patty] I'm gonna cut it down. [chainsaw whirring] [suspenseful orchestral music] - What is it? Patty? - [Melissa] Blackfeather not only led us to daddy, but also to his secret hiding place, the hollow tree where he had hidden all the gold that he had found. He wanted us to have it. - [Patty] Oh, be careful. - [Ray] This must be Blackfeather's. - [Patty] Blackfeather's? - [Sandra] It's a fortune. - And I know who to thank. - [Melissa] I do too, daddy. - [Patty] This is wonderful. [grand orchestral music] - Thank you Melissa. That was very helpful. - Well how much gold was there? And where is it now? - Right here, Your Honor. Government Exhibit A. 688.4 ounces. Worth approximately $270,000. - [Emmett] Just a sample, Mr. Smith, that'll be enough. - Uh, yes, Your Honor. - Your Honor, a mining claim has since been filed for 160 acres in the name of Ray and Patty Talbot, pursuant to the Mining Act of 1872. - May I see that? - [Clint] Sure. - Thank You. - Your Honor, this paperwork makes no difference whatsoever. The gold was found in the hollow of a tree, not extracted from the land and is not subject to a normal claim. The gold clearly belongs to the Government. - This is not about paperwork. This is, well we all know what it's about. It's about gold. Lots of gold. A lot more than what was on this table, and the claim for that gold has been clearly established when that raven took this gold and Patty's necklace and put it in that tree. - Your Honor, Melissa's hearsay testimony does not constitute proof of any kind. The defense has not shown this court any evidence that the bird ever had anything to do with the gold at all. - Not yet. - Not yet? - Uh, we have one more witness. The defense would like to call Professor Ernest C. Byrd. Noted author and ornithological authority. - Objection, Your Honor. This witness plays no role in the material facts of the case. Defense has stipulated to the charges. The law is clear. What's the point? - May I remind the court that this, [sighing] at the heart of this case, it is a human thing. The love of a young girl for her beloved pet. We are here to seek out the truth. To find compassionate justice, not mere blind compliance to the law. And this witness can help us find that truth. - Mr. Dugan is belaboring this issue. Let us not forget the fact that had this been a bear, or a cougar, or some other wild animal that had endangered human lives that animal would have already been destroyed. - This is not just another wild animal. [sighing] It is a very special being. Mr. Byrd can help us establish that. - Sit, Miss Brown. All right, Mr. Dugan, you can call your witness. Please take a seat and raise your right hand, sir. You solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God. - Naturally I do. - [Emmett] Well, state your full name and your credentials. - Ernest Byrd. I'm a professor of ornithology. I've written many books about our feathered friends, and a couple about ravens. - Please, uh, acquaint the court with the nature of ravens. - Well the raven is a member of the crow family. It is much bigger than the crow, which gives it its imposing presence. It is known as the brains of the bird world, because it's very intelligent and, uh, very clever. It has a wider variety of calls than, well, wider than any animal in the kingdom, except for humans, of course. And in the wild, for example, when you hear [hooting] that, you might think is an owl, or perhaps the, um, [imitating bird cry] that could be the spotted grouse. Unless you see that bird with your own eyes because it could be our friend, mister raven, who can mimic many, many sounds in the animal kingdom. [Blackfeather caws] [Ernest whistling] [Blackfeather whistling] [blowing lips] [Blackfeather imitating lips blowing] [laughing] [chittering] [Blackfeather chittering] [Emmett cawing] [Blackfeather caws] [all laughing] You see, Judge, they're very social, very adaptable creatures. They just make wonderful companions. They live to be about 70-years-old or so, and they have a hobby. They love to collect things. Bright shiny things they love. Oh, these are remarkable little fellows. [chuckling] - Is there, uh, any particular significance between ravens and people. - Significance? Oh yes they do, indeed. Did you know that it was the raven that Noah sent from the ark to see if the rains had stopped? I bet you didn't. And also the American Indians thought that the raven, well, had the souls of their ancestors. They regard the raven as guardians. - Objection, Your Honor. I love folklore just as much as the next person, but I fail to see the relevancy here. - [Emmett] Are you going somewhere with this soon, Mr. Dugan? - Yes, Your Honor. A little more indulgence please. Professor Byrd, in your expert opinion, is it possible for Blackfeather to have developed a bond or relationship with Melissa? - Oh, don't you know it. You see, ravens mate for life, unlike us fickle humans. And they often bond with people for life. One person, one raven. They like to bear rewards and protect that special person, and for Blackfeather, I think that Melissa is that very special person. This relationship is very unique, one that's never happened to me. - Ernest, are you making all this up? - Oh no, I could demonstrate this if the court is willing. - Now how could you possibly do that? - Release Blackfeather right here and he'll show you. - I call for the immediate release of the bird, uh, raven. - Objection, Your Honor! It seems Mr. Dugan wants to erect a circus tent and have us all blithely follow him inside to applaud this sideshow. - [Emmett] Overruled. I haven't been to the circus in a while. All right, Mr. Dugan, release the defendant. [quirky orchestral music] [Blackfeather caws] - Oh, Blackfeather, I love you. [Blackfeather caws] Oh, Blackfeather. [Blackfeather caws] - Your Honor, it should be obvious, even to the prosecution, that to deprive this young girl of her beloved pet would be nothing short of cruel and unusual punishment. These two have a special bond. I refer you to Kings, Chapter 17, verses two through six. "And the word of the Lord came unto Elijah, "I have ordered the ravens to feed you." - "So he did what the Lord had told him "and the ravens brought him bread and meat." Yes, that's not exactly the way it appears in Kings, but your point will be noted. I'm ready to pronounce judgment. Will the defendants please rise? [Blackfeather caws] - Judge, can I say something first? - Very well, Mr. Talbot. - I don't care about the gold, Judge. All I want is for Melissa to have her pet raven back. She hasn't fully recovered because Blackfeather hasn't been around. And I haven't been a very good father. But I realize now how much the raven means to her. Please, Judge, find it in your heart to give Blackfeather back to my little girl. Melissa, I made some big mistakes, and I am sorry, but I'll make it up to you honey, I promise. - [Melissa] Daddy. I love you, daddy. - [Ray] I love you, too. [sobbing] - Thanks for your thoughts, Mr. Talbot. Now I'm gonna give you mine. I'm very concerned with the evidence presented here today. The laws of this country are precious. And I'm sworn to uphold the law. [sighing] Regardless of what the media reports, it is the law that makes us safe at night. We cannot trifle with the law. There is a law, however, that dates back to old England. It's a law called Treasure Trove. Or sometimes known as Finders, Keepers. Now I find that it applies here. Therefore, I rule the gold belongs to the finder, [Blackfeather caws] Blackfeather. And it is to be managed by the Talbots. Now I further find that the claim of 160 acres to be a valid claim, provided that they build and maintain a sanctuary thereupon for birds. [Blackfeather caws] The raven, Blackfeather, has taught us all something here today that's very important. All of us on this planet are one, under God. A young girl nearly died trying to save a raven. In turn, that raven has protected and rewarded the girl's family. The court shall not interfere lightly with the extraordinary bond between this raven and Melissa. It is stated in the 91st Psalm, verse Four, "He shall cover thee with his feathers. "And under his wings shall thou trust." I therefore rule that Blackfeather is to be returned to Melissa and her parents. It must be kept out in the wilderness, out of the city, where he can be a pest. I don't want him back in my courtroom ever again. This hearing is over. [gavel banging] - [Patty] Yes! [Patty laughing] - I didn't think you even owned a Bible, Dugan. - It's a pretty good read. You ought to try it some time. I'll, uh, loan you mine any time. - [Dan] Hey, where'd you get that Bible quote? - Laptop. [laughing] - Laptop. [grand orchestral music] [Blackfeather caws] - [Clint] We can learn from this raven. Often, it is just a question of watching and waiting. We never know what might happen. - [Melissa] Once I made a full recovery, Blackfeather went away for a while. Only to return to our bird sanctuary with a mate. Now there are two ravens in our lives. And who knows? Maybe there's a baby Blackfeather in our future. Only God and the Northern Lights know for sure.
