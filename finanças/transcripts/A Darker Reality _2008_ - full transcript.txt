[fearful] Huh, huh, ohhhhh [heavy breathing] [labored breathing] [scream] [knife slashing flesh] Ghost: It's funny... As I write these words down for my amusement and your confusion. How every sentence leads you closer to me! But then again... In your confusion it blinds you even more. As I could stand right beside you and you would be none the wiser. I am everyone you know or met or didn't pay attention to in this mundane existence you treasure so much only when it is in peril. I can tell you this. I'm getting better at focusing my hate for the women of this world. So as the weeks go by after my little gift arrives on your door step. I ask you this Alex. Can you count? [birds chirping] [kids playing] Hey Dad! yeah ! There is a bag over here! Don't touch it, it's probably full of trash! Okay. [whispering] Alex Belasco Los Angeles police department. [startled] Ow! [panic scream] Dad! [background voices] So Quail did you miss me? [southern accent] I missed you Alex. -You did huh? - I like seeing your face. -It's a good face isn't it? - It's a very nice face. Yeah, I'd call more often, but you don't have a phone in here do you? Nah, I ain't got a phone in here. You don't come and see me anymore. I have other inmates who are little sweeter to me anymore. Really? Oh, tease me, tease me. So. Why am I here? Why your here? Why I might know who you looking for? Who am I looking for? [sarcastic] The Ghost! Isn't that all what your calling him? I still read everything I can about you, Alex. Okay, then tell me about the Ghost. [thinking] Hmmmm. What can I tell you about the Ghost? He's um... Talked him about how he... paid a bunch male hookers to cum into a plastic bag. Then he dumped in some body that left on the side of the ten. How the fuck do you know that? I'm in a club Alex. Special club. They all thought it was ah... gang rape gone bad, but... -you knew! -I said how do you know that? [giggling] Hmmm. So-- I give you something, you give me something. What do you want? Change of scenery. A new playmate. There's um... New meat that interests me, across the hallway from my cell. That's not gonna happen. Ah, come on Alex. You can do that, you can arrange it for me. [playful] You can make it happen. Can't you? No. Fuck this. You want to play games. Fine. You know how this works, you want something, you give me something. I-I-I-I will, I will. Well, you gonna give it to me? Tell you what? When your ready to talk to me. -You know how to find me-- -I had online relations with him. What does that mean? On the computer, you know computers. The internet? -Your dead baby fucker. -You know what scrotum tastes like? It's a new friend of yours? -I got lots of friends in here. -I can see that. Yeah! Give me a name. Have I got a name? Hmmmm. I don't know. I got a new playmate? [stern] No. You give me something. I give you something. That's the way it goes. [stern] I want a name. You'll arrange it for me. [angry] Kiss my ass. When you're ready, You give me a call. [background voices] Alex? Hey Tommy. What you doing here? You lost? Working on the Lincoln case. What are you doing here? Talking to Quail. He's a fucking nut job. We received a package, it was addressed to you. -Really, where is it? -Forensics! So far they're coming up with nothing. No prints, no hair, undescript. So, you think it might be our guy? Look there's an issue. Alright, you know the mayor's been involved, right? Upcoming reelection... You given this serial murder a face in the press. He's uh, using this as a tent pole. Oh, he's a politician that's what they do. -You heard of Dr. Jessy Metcalf. -No, who is? She. Lead forensic profiler for the FBI, CIA. Done some television. Smart mind, and a hot body. Takes you places, you the play cards right. [upset] Don't even start. Don't even fucking tell me this-- Mayor has put her in charge of Forensic evidence. She's part of the case, you are going to be working with her on this. [angry] I'm working with her? I'm... Alex, I got something else for you. Patrol, found a girl in a bag this morning. We think it's one of his. She alive? She was attached to your package. No shit. Where is she? She's down at Mannis. You look good by the way Tommy? Um, excuse me. [male voice] Yes. LAPD. Look, I'm looking for a Dr. Chase. A Dr. Evan Chase. [male voice] Evan Chase. Right there. Okay. Thank you very much. Would you excuse me for a second. -Are you Dr. Chase? -Yes, I am. Alright. I am... Detective Belasco. LAPD! Now, I understand a couple weeks ago-- you admitted a caucasian female, late twenties, red hair, named Carey Andrews. Yes we did. She's part of a criminal investigation. I need to talk to her. Is she conscience, can she communicate? -Yeah, but you don't want to. -That's, it doesn't work that way. I'm sorry. [smug] It doesn't? And who are you? I'm Dr. Jessy Metcalf, agent. I'll be working with you on this case? [laughing] You're Metcalf! Yeah, I didn't recognize you without the TV cameras around. -Doc, that's room two fifteen, right? -Downstairs, good luck. -I'll be in my office. -Okay, I'll be right there, Dr. Chase. Excuse me Agent Belasco. Um, I don't want to start off on the wrong foot. [stern] Really? Then why did you steal my case? [calm voice] Okay, I didn't steal your case. I want to catch this guy just as much as you do. But, she's very fragile right now and it could take weeks before I get any information from her. [growing angry] We don't have weeks. -Well, you'll have to trust me that she... -Trust you? Trust you? [angry] You keep a witness locked up for two weeks, without notifying my office, and you take my evidence and lock it up in your lab? [defensive] -Wow, I'm not going to audition my credentials for you-- -Well you have to! [yelling] Cause why would I trust you? [angry] You know what? She is fragile, she has been held captive by a man-- and been raped and tortured for years! Imagine the walls that she's erected just to survive! You go in there the way you are now she's going to shut down and never open up again! [calming down] Look, I want to help you! Just tell me what I can do! I need details! I need to know, sights, sounds, smells! I need to know everything she felt, what she thought! What the room looked like! Details! I need details! -Okay-- -Get them on tape! I'll do what I can! And um...I heard that there was a package delivered to you. His journal. Call Mayor Abrams. He's know we are working together on the case, tell him to release that evidence into your custody. Read over it, and then I'll ring you when I leave here, we can go over what you found out. [insincere] Yeah. Thank you. Jeez... that's-that's really big of you! Thanks very much! [to her self] Nice to meet you Agent. [dark scary music] [sinister laughter] Ghost: Oh. I'm so silly sometimes. Oh. Wait a minute. [sawing flesh] [screams] [woman moaning in pain] Ghost: oh. I don't want you to feel any pain. [nurturing] Be hurting. That would be mean. [whispering softly] I don't want to be mean to you. You rest here. [nurturing] Just rest. [squeaky door] [tense music] Hello, Carey. [stern] Shut the door! [shouting] Shut the door! [gentle] We agreed that I would keep it open. I don't think it's fair, that you can see me and I can't see you. [patronizing] There. Now, it's fair. Carey. Please, just try. Dr. Chase, said that your sister Megan came by to see you. On the 16th. Today's the 17th. I know. I count the days. [softly] But, you don't have to count the days Carey. You're not there anymore. [lucid] In some ways, I still am. [whispering] He liked that. That I could count days. Keep a mental record of events. How long they lasted. When the new stock would come in. Only one more day. Amber M. is added to the list. She's so young. She won't last long. Who's Amber M? [thinking] Been watching her for over a year now. With the sliver in the closet where he kept me some nights. [thinking] I could see him... watching the footage he taped of her. Undressing. -Painting her toe nails. -[heavy breathing ] Ghost: Yeah, that's it. Touching herself. Ghost: That's it.Yeah. He'd fight to keep it hard. But... [matter of fact] Eventually he'd cum! And pull me out of the closet to lick it off him. Ghost: Yeah. I'm getting close. I'm close baby. Yeah! Yeah! [choking] Uh. Uh. Uuuuhhh! [gasping] Uhhh. Uhhh. [whimpering] She's not a whore. [yelling] Not like you! [whispering] I really care. [sweet voice] You're so, so, beautiful baby. [gentle] So. Here. No, no. It's okay. It's like lip, lip gloss. Make's your lips so shiny. [giggling] You look so, so beautiful right now. You know. You look beautiful. [yellling] You fucking whore! [angry] You fucking whore! [threatening] I'm going to deal with you later. [screaming] I'll deal with you later! Dr. Metcalf: Carey is there anything you can remember about her? That might help us. What does Amber M. look like? [annoyed] She looks like any other missing girl in her 20's. Average length of hair. Average height. Average weight. Average. The perfect target. Was there anything on the footage that might give us insight into her location? Anything he might have said? I was bound inside of a closet. Bound. So tight, my fingers burned and felt like they'd fall off. My insides were raw, from him shoving whatever was within reach inside of me. The hour previous. And I knew what was coming. Tasting him. Praying this time I wouldn't throw up, so I could get shut back up for a little while and not be beaten until a bone would snap! Amber M. wasn't the top of my priority list. I'm sorry Carey. You're safe now. [ laughing ] Carey, I'm sorry. What's funny? Funny. Dis... Connected. I counted... how long she'd last. What he'd do to her. She wouldn't last very long. I still have your pictures if you need them back. Okay. 12 days. 16 days. 12 days. 16 days. 9 days. 20 days. 4 days. 3 days. 2 days. 18 days. 7 days. 21 days. 4 days. 8 days. 20 days. 3 days. 6 days.

Gina: You want him to come back. Aren't you sore enough. Shut up Gina. [whispering loudly] Hey, hey, hey, hey, shut up. [whispering loudly] Shut up. Shut up. [whispering loudly] Calm the fuck down. [whispering loudly] Calm the fuck down! Shut up, shut up, bitch, shut up. Don't be so rough with her. Get your fucking hands off of me right now You understand me? You got it? Shhhhhh. Shhhhhh. There's a good girl. You know you are just as bad as he is. [angry] What the fuck did you just say to me? You're just as bad as he is. [very angry] You stupid fucking bitch, you don't anything about me! [yelling] You know nothing of what I have been through! -If I have cut your throat then I will -What is this? What? [yelling] You bitch! Get the fuck away from me! [pleading] We've been through the same thing Gina. We're here too. Useless shit, fucking bitch! -God damit, I'll kill you! -Stop it. No! [ crying ] [crying] I just...I just want to go home. [vomiting] [crying] Help me please. Please help me. [wailing] [crying] I don't want to die. I don't want to die. [birds chirping] [door bell] ding-dong Dr. Metcalf. Hi. You can call me Jessy. Jessy. Look I...I know we got started off on the wrong foot So, I want to make amends. Okay, this is uh... For you. How'd you know I love football. Your website. I uh, I read your blog. - Go Buckeyes. - Go Buckeyes. Come in. So, what's your poison? A little early for Dewars, you know [laughing] Yeah, I was aiming actually a little more at coffee. Coffee. Yes. Okay, would you like cream, sweetener or black. Black is good. So, I uh, saw your show, the other night. -TiVo'd it. -Oh God. Yeah, that thing is going to haunt me forever. Now, when they play that over and over again on TV, do you get paid for that? Ah, I wish I did. I wish I got residuals. Cause they play it all the time. I'd be sitting pretty, but no I do not. You did a good job. Thank you. Is that the report? Ah, yeah. The thing is the ah-- the journal is going to take a while to decipher, because it just rambles on and on. But, what's really interesting. The whole package was sanitized. There's no DNA, there's no nails, there's no skin. Nothing. How about this, you got a head count yet? Yeah, um, 85 girls here. But that was just in the 3 years that Carey was under his control. So, there's probably another list of girls from before then. Any patterns? [thinking] Yeah, you know. They all look alike. I mean... It's like a classroom photo. Nothing above average to set them apart, he just keeps them faceless. And, their ages range. They're all over the board. Any recent developments with her? No, we're still sifting through the database from the board of education. But, it's a partial play, I mean, this one name is like getting a needle out of a haystack. [thinking] Yeah. You know what, let's check his journal. Carey said that he talked a lot about her. And, if that's true, I bet she's in here. -Do you have that on tape. -Yeah, I do. Thank you for letting me borrow that. [reading] Ghost: I killed a man today. I caught him listening at my door, a few too many times. He should have just minded his own business. [laughing] Left the door open one night. [head struck with bat] He took the bait. She lead him right where I wanted him. [scared] Did I do, good daddy? I spent the evening chopping him to jar able pieces. Some for food them. Some for the other ideas I've recently come up with. [singing] ♪ do, do, do, do, do, do, do Ghost: [ laughing ] [shouting] Shut up! Song was over! [sweetly] Remember we used to do that brother when we were little. ♪ do, do, do, do, do, do, do, That's it. [voice over] Gina. She knew better than to shed a tear for the man I killed before her. To show any sign emotion, of every girl I killed. And had her jar up beside me. I'm almost bored at how perfect she's become for me. [laughing] [dark music] [singing] ♪ And that's how we get all the skin off ♪ ♪ do, do, do, do, do, do-do, do-do ♪ Jar-jar-jar-jar-jar-jar! You put it in honey, you put it in. You can do it!

[grunting] [laughing] [sincere] Don't take life so seriously babe. [screams] -Nahhhh! -[screams] [intense music] Ghost: But since I found my sunshine. It's quieter in my head now. I have more time to think. Sunshine, with the bakery. Past Saint J's to her house. Through the alley where I have my perfect place to attack her. Soon Sunshine. Your day is coming. I pulled young Sharon in like a guilty dog. Her eyes and mind averting my sick new task she could only imagine. I watched her close. She's been here for 3 months. Carey was teaching them all quick how to survive. But no one will train my little video star. My Sunshine... no one but me. I had her crawl on to what was left. To give him a fine send off. I video taped it, and sent it to her parents for Christmas. I always hated Christmas. Dect. Belasco: Who do you think this uh... This Sunshine is? Ah, that sounds like what he's calling Amber. Um, Carey said he's been watching her for a long time, and if that's the case, you know, she must hold some sort of fascination for him. He mentions in here, something about a bakery near Saint J's. I don't know maybe it's a point to her possible location. I mean it's a long shot. But, perhaps it's a hospital, [thinking] Saint, Saint... [thinking] Johns? Maybe or... maybe it's a Saint John's a church or something? [thinking] Well, wait a minute, let's just-- I mean how many Saint's names start with J. Let's just list them. [thinking] Okay. Um, I used to teach a class near one in Echo park, it was Saint Judes. No. It was Saint John's. No wait. God so many Saints, I don't know, you know it could be any of them. Or you know maybe it's a street. Ah J street. [cell phone rings ] [sighs] Yeah? Hey Tommy, what's up? Really? Ah, yeah-yeah. Give me about a half an hour okay? Alright. Anyway, just caught a break. What is it? Remember that uh-- remember that wack job Quail that guy who killed the alter boys? Oh yeah.. he's the guy who you got to tell where all the bodies were after he was caught. -Right -How did you do that? [sweetly] He likes me. Huh. Anyways, he um. Apparently he knows something about our guy. Two of them had some type of online tryst. -He wants to enlighten me. -Hmmm. Nice. Okay, so well. I'll just keep going through the papers to see if I can find anymore bread crumbs. They always leave a trail, so.

We gonna be alone? Charlie take off. Thank you. Did you ever realize that... The quality of one's coffee, is a reflection of the environment. Huh. Always taste like warmed up mud, but I remember being in Peru. Moving around from church to church. Renting a nearby villa. Private. Scooping up the young boy after the sermon. [thinking] Having my way with him, till his eyes went grey. And then sitting on the veranda, watching the sunset. Warming my hands with an excellent bean. [stern] You know Quail, I would love to take this walk down memory lane with you. But, get to the point. There is a point to the story. I must thank you for my new room mate. [sweetly] We're getting along famously. I was thinking about what a sick pleasure it was, our correspondence online. How free we both felt. How we talked about things that make the rest of the world buy guns and locks. Home security devices. We even shared video. What you mean, what kind of video? Well when your handsome man seized all my assets, including my computer. You also seized a few video files he sent me. [whispering] See, we said we'd delete them after we watched them.. But I lied. Remember those files you keep on asking me about? [mocking] How they didn't fit my profile. How I said they were from, my experimenting with women. When I was trying to be like my daddy wanted me to. Well. I lied about that. [shouting] Johnny get in here. Johnny: Yes sir. Do me a favor, go down and grab this assholes computers, the hard drive, everything Set it up on my desk.

Please, cause I hate begging so much [growing angry] it runs right through me, through my fucking head and into my spinal cord. It feels like I'm being electrocuted when someone does it. [sweetly] You don't want to electrocute me, do you? [whispering] No. Then I'll put Mr. Teefer away. If you're a good girl. Okay. [whispering] He's right up there. Are you thirsty still? Here!

Tell me what you remember about it. There was this girl, Kim. So young. [thinking] She, she lasted longer than most. Which isn't long at all. 25 days in all. She told me about it after she'd been gone from the basement. [thinking] I was sick. I remember her, cradling me. While I vomited uncontrollably on her hand. Shaking. Then blackness. He must have taken her then. She said she didn't go far, between the basement and this place. Maybe a mile. He struck her! [ hammer hit ] To knock her out. But, she faked being unconscious. Just in case she had a chance to run. She tried, when he opened the truck. But, he struck her... then she was inside. [coughing] [crying] I'm Kim. [whispering] Hey. [crying] Shhhhh. Shhhh. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Black Girl: No, it's not. [crying] You didn't see what he did to her. [crying] In front of me. [crying] I can still smell him in here. [crying] He beat her face. [crying] He wouldn't stop. Then he took jars of rotten meat and he stuffed them inside of her. [crying] He packed her like a fucking turkey. [crying] Then he took fishing line and he sewed her up. [crying] And she's still alive. [crying] She's still fucking alive and he's coming back. He's coming back. He's coming back for you. [crying] No, that can't, I've never been with anybody before.

You know, playing. Enjoying to a catalog, just like all little boys do. Curious. And that's when the cunt walked in. I'll cut it off. She said as she held my shriveling penis in her claw like hand. Sick little things. The serpent of man. Spitter of venom. She said, if I catch you touching the serpent again, [dark music] I'll make you eat what I cut off! [angry] Understood! You taught me well.

She gave me a couple of um... fragments of street signs from the second location. -Second location? -Yeah, apparently there are two places that he keeps the girls. One they call the basement, and another one, not too far from there. I think it's an old buidling. Anyway, she remembered two bits of street signs. I wrote them down for you, there on a paper over there. Anything else on the footage? Ah, actually yeah. We huh, we pulled a still. And, in the frame, we found a, there's a sticker has some signatures, some dates and some names on it. So, we're going to try to enhance that. Hopefully, when we get the image, we're gonna match that up to a log from Edwards electric. -Oh, good. -We'll see. Well, that's good. Television has made me such a meticulous creature.
