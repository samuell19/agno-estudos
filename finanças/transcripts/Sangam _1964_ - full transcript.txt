The car too is parked in the porch. If there is a motor in his house then there is an aeroplane in my house. I will take you round the world in an aeroplane. Radha, don't get influenced by his talks. He will die and he will also kill you. Forget about him. Come and stay in my house. Will you stay? She will not stay. Radha will stay in my house. - I am asking Radha. - I am telling you.

I like your attitude You're bleeding but you still won't say a word against your friend Radha. I've made the house bigger.

Stick with one's kind He may have a car, but I have an airplane I'll take her in my airplane and show her the world: London, Rome, Paris Everyone will be gawping. I'll take her away Just come down and I'll show you! I wish you fall in a ditch. Just come down and I'll show you! Sunder! What are you doing? I meant to throw the hook into the water, but I missed Give me back my clothes I can't. They're tangled up, just like our destiny Say my name again. It sounds so nice coming from your lips Stop it! Give me back my clothes I will, but first answer my question - I answered it a hundred times - But it was always no Say yes just once. Or you won't get your clothes Nonsense! Imagine for a moment that I'm not Sunder... ...but Gopal who would say to you: Like the Ganges river, like the Jumna river... Tell me, Radha, will we ever be united? Like the Ganges river, like the Jumna river... Tell me, Radha, will we ever be united? Tell me, Radha, will we ever be united? No, never!

I'll tell everyone - Let's celebrate before you go - I'll celebrate with Gopal Look at this Where's Sunder? Did he know I'm coming? Of course he does. He was spreading the news all over town - So why didn't he come? - He'll be at the party Party? To celebrate your return I will go through the customs and come. Gopau Well, my lawyer? How are you? Why weren't you at the airport? I came there by cycle... ...but you had already driven away I cried out "Gopa|," but you couldn't hear me You look great. What's this garland? Garland? I had brought it for you But you had left, so I wore it You and me, is the same thing You were the one studying law, and I became the lawyer Now I found you Here, my friend Welcome home, Gopal. - You were away so long - Come Let's sit I hear you left the Air Force and joined a flying club Yes! I teach people how to fly But I cannot find anyone who would like to touch the sky What can I say, Sakina? I felt so happy when Gopal complimented me Don't you think you should talk to Gopal? You don't think he... No Playing house when you're children is one thing... ...getting married and running a house is another thing Tonight I'll tell him everything and see what he thinks Congratulations, Gopal, you're one of us lawyers now Thank you...Won‘t you join the judge? Captain, why are you hiding in the corner? I'm watching the fun The flow of the party By all means, but may I fill up your empty glass while you're at it? - How about a drink for me too? - Sakina! You are looking very charming. - Thank you. What can I get you? First ask me what I have for you - What is it? - Over there Radha. I came for the fun But she has something to tell you and hear - To say what? - Ask her Oh dear, I forgot. Let me get you a drink - Don't trouble yourself - Let me We're not short of servants here Please let her. She must learn how things are done here After all, she has to come here as a bride one day You're dazzling tonight. Who'll be struck by your lightning? How are you, Radha? What was Sakina saying? She was right... what did she say? That you wanted to talk to me - Congratulations, Gopal - Thank you You're looking lovely And Sunder? He isn't here yet. What a strange man - Did you talk to him? - How? There's such a crowd Can't move here - I don't see your friend Sunder - We expect him any minute now There he is! You're always late. Must you be late today? I can't keep anything from you. You know I only got one suit I had to have the trousers mended I wanted to look smart. Radha is coming today Is she here? Where? Seriously, Radha, you must speak to Gopal tonight How can I with that idiot hovering over him? Gopal, stay with me What if my heart stops beating or my pulse halts? Say hello. I'll be right back - Shall I? - Go! Look, his |ordship's coming here Leave Sunder to me, you go trap Gopal I say, Mr. Sunder... "Mister?" Call me Sir: I'm wearing a suit Sir Sunder, we hardly meet these days That's the problem: we hardly meet these days Talk to Sakina, I'll be right back See? So talk to me - What about? - Let's talk about Radha About Radha? Carry on I hear you're madly in love with her Has the news hit the marketplace? If you don't mind, may I say something? With pleasure Why don't you ask Radha what she wants? What you have in mind may not be what she wants That's why I'm here Today I'll tell her my heart's desire and ask hers too Don't you worry. Want a drink? I'll be right back See, there's such a difference between Gopal and Sunder A worthy son of a worthy father Today a lawyer, tomorrow a magistrate, then a judge And the other 0ne's always been a wastrel He's even come here today with an accordion hanging off his neck Whatever you may say, Sunder is a gem at heart And that's why I have only one dear friend in the whole world - Sunder You're so biased sometimes All you see is his accordion You don't see how he is the life of a party He charms everyone What is it? Have you seen Sunder? It's you I need to speak to I've tried to say it many times but couldn't The judge is asking for you, son. Come along I'll be right back Ask your friend... he's not eating Sunder, aren't you eating? - No, I can't swallow - Why not? What I have to say to her is stuck in my throat. I must spit it out first How will you say it? By playing your instrument? Yes, Captain. By playing and singing Wonderful! Music is the wine of life That's why, Judge sahib: "Every heart that loves will have a song to sing" What a line - Then complete the couplet - Go on "Every heart that loves will have a song to sing..." "You can recognize a crazed-lover even in a crowd" Every heart‘ that loves will have a song to sing Every heart‘ that loves will have a song to sing You can recognize a crazed-lo ver even in a crowd You can recognize a crazed-lo ver even in a crowd F/rsz‘ you stole my heart, now you tum your eyes away But‘ I shall remain constant‘ even if /0 ve is one-sided This is the way 0f love Even though you don '1‘ know it The moth will always fo//ow the ﬂame You can recognize a crazed-lo ver even in a crowd Every heart‘ that loves will have a song to sing You can recognize a crazed-lo ver even in a crowd Those forgotten memories of my happy childhood They return each night to rob the sleep from my eyes What I wanted to tel/ you... .../ could not‘ say.

This unspoken story... will linger on after I'm gone Befriending e veryone, this stranger will depart You can recognize a crazed-lo ver even in a crowd Won't you dance, Sakina? Me dance? No way... but you should What are you looking at? Nothing Tell me You don't know how long I've waited for you Really? "|'m writing this letter as an answer to that very question "The answer is that I don't know what the answer is" Have you no shame? Reading other people's letters? So, now I'm the "other?" And he's all important? Give me the letter, I'll deliver it Can't I deliver it myself? Then why is it still here? I'll give it to him when I see him Shall I ask him to come here? Sure. I'm not scared I'll call him Captain, I'll take these papers with me. I'll send them the notice Please come upstairs Let me accompany you upstairs Where are you going? - Sakina called - Not Sakina, Radha did I don't know about that. I am going upstairs Sure. After all you fought in the First World War Okay, let's go - Did you call me? - No, not me, Radha did What is it? Nothing at all - For no reason - Now tell him - Why are you lying? - Ok, I'll tell the lawyer The thing is Radha... It must be a joke between you two. I was made into a fool What's this nonsense? You didn't give him the letter What's the hurry? I'll give it to him He's still downstairs No, he is leaving Give it to me Come with me Oh no! - What do we do now? - Delivered the letter? Get it, Hurry! Father? Coming! - Hurry! - But the letter? Later. If we don't go, father will come here and the secret will be out A letter! Damn, it's in Hindi Panditji was right. Knowing how to read Hindi is essential I wish I'd learnt to read Hindi - I've got it, Gopal! - Got what? A priceless treasure. In short: this letter The decision of my fate... - Gopal, I am at your mercy - What are you doing? I've come to you to have my fate read out Read it and tell me if I'm in hell or on the Everest I mean, on Everest or in hell Tell me what it says "Sweetheart" Sweetheart? - Say it again - Sweetheart! "Take the wine glass from me, I'm already drunk" What's the joke, Sunder? It's not a joke, Gopal. You won't understand. Read on! "Sweetheart, I've always read the question in your eyes. Was I right?" You were right, my love, absolutely right. Read on! "|‘m writing in answer to that very question" Answer it, quickly! "The answer is that I don't what the answer is "When you're away, I think of all the things I'll say to you "But when I see you, I can't speak "This is not new. It's always been like that "This may be what the poets write about "This may be the thing called Love "Yours, Radha" My Radha Hold me, Gopal. I'm going to fall Stop this act, Sunder This isn't an act, Gopal. This is love "Love is not simple. Think of it thus: "|t's a river of fire in which you must drown Enough drowning lovers They exist only in Urdu poetry How would you know? Have you ever been in love? Yes, I have With whom? Radha ls there only one Radha in the world? Is there another? There was one Radha who was Lord Krishna's beloved The name-sake of all Radhas Oh, that Radha For a moment, you almost took my life Look“. My hands and feet have gone cold As if the blood froze in my veins Gopal, I am madly in love with Radha I can't live without her But I'm telling you the truth: If you loved my Radha, I would move out of your way My heart might be shattered... ...but I'd sacrifice my love for your friendship Where have you gone? I am right here with you, just thinking about something... You think too much, do too little Tell me what to do I'll make the plans and you'll go along, no questions asked Right, no questions asked First thing, we're going boating tomorrow And it's Sunday - But I have work, Sunder - Can't you give up work for me? Give up work? I'll give up my life for you Then come with me, I'll take your life Come with me - Where to? - Just come - Pick up the phone - Done! Now dial: 3...5...6...2 That's Radha's number Tell her you've arranged a boat outing for tomorrow - Captain sahib, this is Gopal - Say you'll pick her up at 3 - How are you? - Who cares... Very well, thank you I wanted to say that tomorrow, Sunday, we're going boating Yes, very good. We'll come... Radha too That was Gopal. He's invited us to go boating tomorrow - Invited us? - He's invited Radha too He's invited Radha too, or only Radha? I don't know... I'm going Sure! Suddenly you feel young again? Let the one who is really invited go. It's a start, let it take its course If Radha can get a boy like Gopal, what more can she ask for? - How should I know? - How should you indeed! All you know is you were a captain in 1916 - You're having a big party - No, a small party For two Radha will sit here And Gopal here And me here One with intoxicating eyes The other whose arms hold you as you fall On one side, a friend, the other side, a sweetheart ls this the time you show up? I spent a lifetime waiting for you Sunder here? Did you invite him too? He's the one who's invited us both - And the phone call? - I called on his instructions Have you turned into ice? Are you coming or shall I? How are you, Radha? - I hear you got a new boat - I just lowered into the water You'll be amazed - It's really nice - Come and see - Gopal, take a look - I'll be right back - I'm coming too - Where are you going? Let me show you my boat Who are you looking at? Gopal? No harm in it. You can't find a friend like Gopal anywhere I feel pain, and his eyes fill with tears I'm happy, and his heart overflows, like yesterday - What happened yesterday? - I read your letter - You read it too? - Well, no, Gopal did We have no secrets from each other. We tell each other everything It's good, right? Where's your boat? Here it is - How do you like it? - This? So tiny? How many will it seat? TWo! You and me They say two's couple, three‘s a crowd and four's a gang of thieves Who's the couple? There's only one couple in the world: you and me. Right? How do you like my amazing boat? So come aboard You think she'll go in your ragged boat? You think she'd sit in your tub? Nobody would! She who sails with me sits in my heart I don't ply a water lorry like you, begging for passengers - Move your lorry out of the way - Lorry? She's a beauty! I've seen your beauty and your beauﬁes It's a paper boat and paper flowers A cheap piece of tin and you're showing off? Get rid of this wreck! See, Radha? He's sailing a water lorry and dares beg for passengers! Good riddance! So you were saying... Can you tell how deep the lake is? Must be about 30 feet - ls there anything deeper than that? - Of course, the sea Deeper than the sea? I don't know Your eyes, Radha. Your eyes. Let me drown in them That's what I don't like. You turn everything into a joke Sometimes I like your humour Sunder, you're good at heart and I like you too... But there are limits and sometimes you cross the line Today I want to know what my limits are Tell me my limit I don't know - Tell me, what is my limit? - I don't know! - Tell me what is my limit? - I don't know! 0 my love 0 my love 0 my love 0 my love, the purpose of m y //fe is found in your heart 0 my love, the purpose of m y //fe is found in your heart There's no place on this earth where you are not man/fest There's no place on this earth where you are not man/fest 0 my love, the purpose of m y //fe is found in your heart What could make you angry? What could make you sad? What‘ consumes your every thought? We will be united one day 0 my love, the purpose of m y //fe is found in your heart 0 my love, the purpose of m y //fe is found in your heart One day l shall hold you in my arms The world will be left with e yes wide open As I take you away with me One day l shall hold you in my arms The world will be left with e yes wide open As I take you away with me 0 my love, the purpose of m y //fe is found in your heart There's no place on this earth where you are not man/fest 0 my love, the purpose of m y //fe is found in your heart Radha? This is Gopal - ls the Captain there? - N0 And your mother? She isn't here either - Cou/dn '1‘ I help ? - / must talk to them Tell them I'll come over tonight. It's very important I need to talk to them Talk? About you About me? Sakina, you know who that was? Gopal He's coming to talk to father about something very important About me...What can he have to say about me? Tell me, Sakina He'll say: "l don't like Radha, she's stupid and ugly! "Marry her off to Sunder!" Don't say such a thing. Not even as a joke! Serve the drinks, then go upstairs It's not proper for the girl to be present Why, mother? I told you: there are certain things a man cannot discuss openly Do come in Have a sit. - How are you? - Well, thank you. And you? Fine, thanks - Greetings aunt. - Live long, dear. Sit, sit. - How are you? - Well, thank you - And you mother, is she well? - She's fine How are you? Fine, thank you. And how are you? Fine, thank you - You, here? - Your humble servant Madness! You think it's clever leaping over walls? This is just a wall, Radha For you, I'd jump across rivers of fire, oceans of death What kind of a joke is this? Please, Sunder, go away! VVhy? You don't know. They're having a serious talk downstairs... about me I do know, very well - G0pa|‘s here! - Who else do I have in the world? Why don't you get it? Go away now, please! Now that we're joined for life, where can I go? You look lovely I'm telling you again, Captain You won't find another boy like Sunder Forget it, Mr. Lawyer. Would I let Radha marry that useless man? He isn't educated or rich He barely ears 150 rupees a month. Can my Radha live on that? What if I'm asked what the "gentleman" does... ...what shall I say? That he left a good job with the Air Force... ...to swan about in the Flying Club rickety planes? No way! Men become responsible after marriage, sir Sunder will too He's a diamond at heart Maybe so, sir, but I'm not the jeweller who's willing to buy it I feel bad having to turn you down I know you're his friend and have come here on his behalf But I can't help it Son, do you mind if I say something? If you like, we can let Radha marry you Marry me? Think about it I can't even consider it Are we so unworthy? No, I didn't mean that at all There must be a reason ls there a flaw in Radha? How can you say that? Only a lucky man can marry a girl like Radha So what's your objection? Objection? There's no objection, sir Just like you, Captain, I can't help it Let me pass, Sunder How can I? My fate is about to be sealed today Then here's my answer: I don't like you! Have you seen your face in the mirror? I'm seeing it now In your eyes. It's not so bad As if! Being a clown isn't enough. You have to be someone in life - One has to be what? - Let go One has to be what? I'll be whatever you want, just tell me what I don't know Don't tell Radha that Gopal came to talk about Sunder Tell us he came to sound us out and we said we'd think it over If one says yes right away, the matter loses its gravity I think Gopal will come back in a few days and say: "l agree to marry Radha" I tried my best, Sunder, I left no stone unturned... Don't say any more, Gopal - Believe me, I did my best... - Why do you keep saying that? - So that you don't think that... - Are you mad? Don't I know you'd put your life on the line for me? I need to become someone, Gopal Radha also said that it wasn't enough to be a clown A man has to be something So I will become something Why the sad face? Smile, friend Keep smiling, Gopal You have such a great smile There's only one person whose smile can match yours - and that's Radha When she smiles, the moon and sun seem to shine together Anyway... Where are you taking me, Gopal? Tell me I'll tell you on the way But what is it? Where are we going? I don't understand You'll soon find out You know where you're going and what you have to do You have been briefed I have to say one more thing Don't forget that you serve in the Indian Air Force... ...and the Air Force has faith in your courage and patriotism You're here? What is this? The uniform... These planes... What's all this? You once said being a clown wasn't enough... ...that one should be something, do something This is Air Force uniform and I fly these Air Force planes And today this plane will fly me away Where? A soldier can't reveal his destination One minute, Gopal I'm going, Gopal. I don't know when I'll be back Before I go, I must say something Tell me, Sunder You're everything to me in the world: father, mother, brother, friend After I'm gone, let no man come between me and Radha Promise me Give me your word I promise If I die, that's another matter Die? What are you saying? I won't die, Radha I will be back. I'll certainly come back To you. For you Come back to me? For me? Listen! Sunder, I must tell you Don't get the wrong idea I don't love you, Sunder I don't love you Take care of yourself, Sunder I won '1‘ die, Radha I won '2‘ die /'// certain/y come back 7'0 you. For you Gopal, I can ﬁght‘ all the dangers in the world /'/n ﬁghting them but I can't ﬁght the darkness /n my mind When I don 't get Radha ’s /etters, the darkness grows so dense... .../t blots out al/ the l/jghts in the world G0 to Radha today and tell her to write 7'0 write me a letter before I go mad Yours, Sunder G0 to Radha today and tell her to write 7'0 write me a letter before I go mad Remember how we used to play at building houses... You, me and Sunder You used to say: "Radha will stay in my house" And Sunder used to say: "Radha will stay in my house" He still says the same thing, Radha Still? That's what I've come to ask you Why haven't you answered his letters? - I just haven't - Why not? Playing house as children is one thing It's quite another as husband and wife Sunder is only a childhood friend to me, nothing more If you had a woman's heart, you'd understand my predicament What predicament? - I love someone else - Who? - You - Are you mad? - You're driving me to it - It's a sin even to listen to you Then I shall pay your sins when I die But tell me just this once: have you never loved me? You're lying! You just kept silent out of your friendship with Sunder It's for his sake that I keep silent today, or else I'd say something Then for his sake, tell me what's in your heart today What's in my heart is Sunder, fighting death out there He's immersed in fire and smoke all day... ...and there's only one picture before his eyes: Radha yearning for him There were so many rocks he could crashed into. Why did he choose you? There were no less rocks for me either. Why did I choose you? What is it? I've got a letter, in Hindi. From Radha. Will you read it? "Dear Sunder "...|ook after yourself and as you said: "Come back to me, for me "|'|| wait for that moment. Your Radha" My Radha You're very lucky, Sunder To have a beloved like Radha and a friend like Gopal "Your Radha" Panditji was right. Reading Hindi is very important A friend is no longer a friend A beloved is no longer a beloved 0 //fe, I can no longer trust in you How wonderful! Why don't you ever sing something else, Kishan? Always the same sad song People do laugh and smile sometimes You can smile, Sunder. You sweetheart didn't break your heart Your friend did not stab you in the back Or you'd say the same "A friend is no longer a friend. A beloved is no longer a beloved "O life, I can no longer trust in you" We could do nothing. Our forces are still surrounded by the enemy Without weapons or rations - Supplies cannot reach them - Why not, sir? The planes cannot get through, the mouth of the valley is narrow And each foot is covered by non-stop enemy anti-aircraft guns fire With your permission, sir, I'd like to try You're a bomber pilot, this is a Dakota job No job is too inferior at war. Grant me permission, sir You know what that means? Sure death Death for me, life for my fellow soldiers Please give me the chance I promised someone to be somebody, do something Please let me do it Please, sir, let me go I even asked him: "You know what that means? Sure death" He answered: "Death for me, life for my fellow-soldiers" And it came true What a man... "|t is with great sorrow that I must inform you... "...that Flight Lieutenant Sunder Khanna...

My magistrate I may be magistrate to others... But to you... I am forever your captive My captive? My mother's coming to see yours Your mother's coming here? Why? She'll come and say: "There is a queen in your house... "...and a slave in mine" And then? Then your mother will take this slave And your mother will take a slave home too, isn't that so? Gopal! Come quick I've been waiting for hours. Where were you? What is it, mother? - I had news that made me dance - What is it? You'll dance with joy too Look! Sunder's alive! He's alive! Praise the Lord! What more can I want now? You're a magistrate, soon your wife will live in this house All that was missing was Sunder and God has given him back I'm going to the temple to give thanks I didn't know, Sunder, I had no idea A calamity was about to happen I almost snatched what was yours by right, friend I was about to betray your trust How could I have ever looked you in the eye again? How could a friend trust another friend again? How could one take a vow of friendship again? Thank God you're alive, Sunder. You're alive! You're alive Gopal, have you heard? Sunder's alive! He's alive, Gopal I'm so happy tOdaY I can't find words to express myself Gopal, Sunder's alive How could you be a groom without Sunder at your side? The wedding would have felt incomplete How could I marry without Sunder? Let's go quickly and meet his train Don't sit now, let's go - I'm not going - Why? What will Sunder say if he sees me at the station without you? That's just what worries me What will he say if he does see us together? He would say: "Congratulations, Gopa|" "Be happy with Radha" And what will I say? You'll say: "Meet Radha "My Radha" He should be the first to hear our wedding news He should be the last to hear it Not sure if he should ever hear it Who knows what dreams he still has, what hopes What dreams? What hopes? Dreams and hopes of you My mother probably won't talk to your mother now No Why won't she? I'm asking you, why not? What will Sunder think if she does? Have you considered what I would think? Or my parents? Sunder is my friend, Radha, my closest friend Am I to be sacrificed on of your friendship's altar? My love! My life The first sacrifice I'm making is my own heart's happiness I ask for your sacrifice second I won't make this sacrifice, do you hear? I won't! G0! Go away! Oh God Aunty? May you live long! We got your wire today Isn't Gopal at home? Where is he? Well, my magistrate, how are you? How are you, Sunder? See for yourself: here I am, alive, in one piece I told you, I'm not an easy man to break You're right, Sunder. You came back at the right time After what we'd heard... ...yet here you are Namaste, Sunder sahib Stand straight What are you doing? - Warding off the evil eye - Off me? Ward the evil eye off Gopal. He's vulnerable, I'm tough Even ifl had died, I'd have come back to see Gopal May your enemies perish! Come, put it in the fire Hear that? You're reading the paper? A man is back from the dead. No news could be bigger That dead man is right here Leaveit You haven't changed, Sunder A whirlwind in human shape But you have changed What do you mean? I can see you're not the same Gopal You don't look too happy to see me back I thought you'd be dancing with joy, shouting from the rooftops The things you say. How can I not be happy to see your back? The age for dancing with joy and shouting from the rooftops is over Cigarette? How's Radha? She's well, very well Gopal, even now when I say Radha's name or hear it... ...the hair on my hand stands on edge And my heart calls out "She begins to sing, I play the tune "Ca|| out to the life that has passed" Let's go to Radha's house I hope the wall has come down now that I've become somebody Why not? The poor thing has been waiting ages for you - Go to her - On my own? - I've so much work - Work? Fool, your most important work isn't done What work? Love, you idiot, love What did you achieve in these two years? Couldn't even find your own Radha? Damn it, Gopal Let's go Yes, sir, your no-good Sunder - Janaki, who's here - Who is it? Sit down, magistrate Sunder, my son Radha, see who's here Oh, Sunder, how I cried for you We had such strange news ofyou How are you, Sunder? I promised I'd come back See? Here I am. Alive and in one piece Why are you all standing? Sit down, Gopal You too... let me get your drinks I'll be right back I want to see... ...t0 touch the thing that would not let me die - We heard... - You heard right Death was certain My plane burst into flames, no idea where I crashed For two years I was neither alive nor dead Dead? Yes, I had a head injury that caused a loss of memory I couldn't remember who I was I went from one doctor, one hospital to another And what was the first word I uttered when my memory came back? - What? - Your name, Radha, your name Only your name kept me alive They say a drowning man clings to a straw. I clung to your name In the dark clutches of death, I clung your name, to your memory You know what saved me? Your letter - My letter? - But I never... Have you forgotten? You asked me to post it I read that letter again and again I usually keep my wallet in my right pocket And your letter was in my right pocket Right here, next to my heart Just think that death bounced off your letter Believe me, Radha, I've crossed rivers of death to come to you It wasn't Radha's letter that saved you It was her prayers and her unwavering love... ...that stood as a wall between you and death You're crying? Just hearing about it? What's there to cry about? I'm here with you, alive and well Here you are, next to me. Don't cry, Radha, please Don't cry, Radha Death is behind me, life is ahead of us... ...to live together, to laugh together Now, smile. Smile Gopal, why don't you tell her? See, Gopal, she couldn't even hear it I'm bowled over by one thing, friend I lived for her smiles... Now her tears overwhelm me If hearing my story made her cry so much... ...| wonder how much she cried, waiting for me How much Radha loves me Yes, she loves you very much What? Still standing? Sit down and eat I must get back to work, I'll be back We'll be back every day, aunty, right, Gopal? Did you see Sunder? How he's changed - The uniform suits him - Why not? He's an officer, like me I've been thinking... G0pa|'s mother hasn't said a word Could they have something else in mind? Before we consider anything, we should consult Gopa|'s mother Of course we will What is it, son? Get me married without delay I'll go to Radha's mother today N0, not Radha‘s mother I'll marry the ugliest girl in the world, I'll learn to live with her Don't mention Radha's name again But what turned you off Radha in one day? My heart rejects her I liked Radha till yesterday, but not any more But, Gopal, I've already given my word! I asked for her hand on your behalf. Foryou So now refuse on my behalf Say that Gopa|‘s changed his mind Don't beat around the bush There's no need to say any more. I heard you Don't listen to him, he doesn't know what he's saying or why... This is the boy's mother talking You are the girl's father Consider this: If your daughter enters this house against my will... ...wi|l she be happy? Forgive my impertinence but it's the truth I will not marry Radha Not at any cost Good thing I didn't stay longer to hear any more Tried to save some dignity What choice did you have? Stay and begged? I'll meet Gopal once more and ask him plainly Not Gopal, go and see Sunder Gopal is a magistrate but Sunder is an officer He dotes on Radha, always has Remember? He once asked for her hand, and we refused He lacks nothing. He's good-looking, young She must marry where she's respected What is this? Invitation to my wedding I should envy your fortune I too have a letter for you What is it? Your posting order Where? Air Force advisor, London Wedding in India, honeymoon in Europe Hurry up, everyone's waiting What is it, Radha? Nothing Your joke has become a reality. I am getting married - to Sunder Wait! The knot's come undone What are you staring at, Gopal? Tie it with your own hands... ...so tight it'll never come apart again Sunder, I am reborn again today I'm entering a new world I have left my home, my life, my world far behind me I want to forget the past now that we are together I want only one image in my eyes... ...in my heart... ...of you, Sunder What is this? Worshipping me while I'm still alive? - Promise me - What's this? Never let us be apart - Get up, your place isn't there - No, promise me But what's all this? Get up, Radha Get up Your place is here In my eyes... in my heart Promise me, I'll always be yours. Let no one come between us No one ever will. No one He looks so good, doesn't he? See how lifeless our photos looked without this one? Two things uphold my life Gopa|'s friendship and your love. I couldn't live without either What's this? Sad on a day like today? No, |'m...|'m smiling You look so lovely when you smile It's like a million stars have tied tiny bells on their feet The moon and the moonlight are playing a melody of love Then“. Do you love me a lot? A whole lot Do you really love me so much? Do you really love me so much? - What are you looking at? - You Remember I used to say, I'd show Radha the whole world Everyone will be gawping. I'll take her away - Where did the coin fall? - Over there What did you ask for? My wish was... ...happiness for you and peace for me - Now you make a wish - Me? What can I ask for? I asked God for you and got everything I don't need to raise my hands in prayer now - Are you happy? - A whole lot _ Ami You?

Did you see the price of that stupid bagpipe? 575, new francs! So? We'll skip dinner Great, we've already skipped lunch. lf we skip dinner, what'|| we live on? The air made by that stupid bagpipe? You don't understand, Radha. We're tourists Can't buy both things - Then we buy the purse - No way! The bagpipe There are two beautiful things in the world: a woman and bagpipes Both make music Too much poetry... right, we buy neither! So now you're cross Since the world began, men have always had to make sacrifices I too am a man Here... go and buy your purse Go on, then!

The world moves on but men stay stuck, old-fashioned and outdated That's right, outdated And remember, if I can't go somewhere, neither can you And what if I do? In your dreams... That's marriage for you Ever since marriage was invented, women think it's a jail Men are the prisoners and they the jailers But, madam jailer, prisoners are known to escape sometimes Catch! There's your bagpipe! What's this? The show‘s started. Sit down, front seat Horrible. It shames me to see this I see, but you feel no shame watching it there It's different.

You've given me everything, and I've taken it. Your love I'll give you something to make everything pale in comparison The world is nothing Truly, Radha, when you see it you'll agree Get ready quickly. I'll get the phone What's the joke? But why? All right, by the waterfall? Close your eyes Here's your gift! Terrific, right? - Did we keep you waiting? - No Well, Radha? How do you like my present? Gopal, your coming here has brought warmth to these mountains Happy birthday, Radha Say thank you, Radha He's come here from Bombay via London, just for you I'm sorry, I came empty-handed on Radha's birthday Your hands may be empty but your heart isn't My friend, I'm a trader in hearts. I buy and sell them You two talk, I'll go and arrange lunch. Meet you there How are you, Radha? How do I look? Don't I look happy? - Maybe you can't see my joy - What are you saying? Why have you come? VVhy? Don't ask me, ask Sunder So many letters, phone calls, cables, with just one theme "Gopal, come today, come now!" For your sake, for his own. I couldn't refuse You never could refuse, right? Didn't you know that one look could reveal the whole story? Destroy everything? Those who make sacrifices don't come to gloat Whatever you may think, I'm here for Sunder‘s sake You've come for his sake, now leave for mine... ...and don't come back into my life again A married woman's life is like this rainbow that can sway in a storm It cannot be seen in flowing water It's there and yet not there Not there, sit here In front of me I haven't seen you both together for ages Say something - How are you, Radha? - Fine, thank you - How are you? - Fine, thank you Done? Thank you, I am fine Have you nothing else to talk about? - Does your father write to you? - Yes, he does - ls your mother back from Haridwar? - She'll come back Enough of your talk! Now I'll talk Which cities did you visit in Europe? What did you see? Nothing My friend, I will show you Europe We will travel together We'll stay in the same hotel. Visit the sights together Well, Radha? Didn't I say? Two things uphold my life You And him I can't live without either I am so glad you've come. The world is a happy place now Let me order food Gopal will sit here Radha will sit next to Gopal. And me? Here In front of Gopal and Radha, like old times Lost in thought? Come and see what I've arranged We're together again, on your birthday, and in Europe! So here's the plan: first to the casino for cocktails and dance Gopal must see the Swiss casino We'll dine here in the evening ‘ A 900d plan? — Very gQQd - Will Gopal like it? - Why shouldn't he? But look, he's not here yet. I'll call him Amazing! They say he's checked out I'm a married woman Those who make sacriﬁces don '1‘ come to gloat I couldn't bring much. This is all There was no need to bring anything. How was Europe? Wonderful, the time just flew by Are you haPPY? Yes, I'm very happy, Sakina But...one day Gopal turned up In Europe? Sunder invited him to come for my birthday So what? Your affair with Gopal ended ages ago - N0, Sakina... I'm scared - Scared of what? Sunder can't live without me... ...but he can't live without Gopal eﬁher Even if Gopal avoids us, Sunder will drag him back And if Gopal comes into my house, I don't know if my house will survive You don't know Sunder You'll see, Gopal. Radha will be overjoyed to see you You're so late today I kept looking at the door, then at the clock Time dragged Time dragged It took ages to persuade him to come I got married and lost a friend - Have you lost me? - Sure, I have Look at him, Radha. He meets us in Europe and runs away We come back here, he runs away here too Hard work bringing him here - Nice house, Sunder - It's your first visit, isn't it? He just wouldn't come I had to swear on our childhood, our friendship... He melted only when I said your name Forget it Sit down, you two. I'm going to change Sit down I didn't choose to come I was brought here Believe me, I didn't want to But Sunder... How can I explain it to Sunder? What pretext can I use? We both drank a drop and left the drink house We were swaying The glass bottle bent down to the gob/er... ...and said a few words - Some soda and some glasses - Right away Now I must say something to you Yes? All my wishes have come true, except one - What? - To see you married Look at me, can a man ask for more? A nice house, a wife like Radha, a friend like you Life is fulfilled Not everyone is as lucky as you, and have all their wishes come true Why not? Anything is possible if you try You may even find a wife like Radha. I'll find her for you I'll never forget the favour you did me, Gopal - What favour? - You got me married You made me Radha's husband Forget it. Let's talk of something else That reminds me I had a friend at the front A Hindi poet who joined the Air Force He used to read me Radha's letters You know I couldn't read Hindi What I know I learned from him Seeing you and Radha, his story comes back to me What story? He too loved a girl. But she wasn't like Radha He also had a friend... he wasn't a friend like you So when he read Radha's letters... ...tears would fill his eyes, he would sigh and say: "Sunder, you're very lucky "You have a friend like Gopal "A sweetheart like Radha" He'd say that and then hum Always the same song, a heartbreaking song What song? When I think of that song, my hair stands on end Do you want to hear it? I'll sing it for you A friend is no longer a friend A beloved is no longer a beloved 0 //fe, I can no longer trust in you I can no longer trust in you A friend is no longer a friend A beloved is no longer a beloved 0 //fe, I can no longer trust in you I can no longer trust in you I left in your care the treasure of m y love You were that friend, none other You were my fel/ow-tra vel/er 0n the path of life You were that friend None other A// secrets are unra vel/ed A conﬁdant is no longer a confidant 0 //fe, I can no longer trust in you I can no longer trust in you She embraced me /0 ving/y Speaking in a tearful voice Who else was that but you? None other On the day that I departed, pearl-like tears ﬁlled her e yes Who else was that but‘ you? None other The night of intoxication is over Its eﬁects no longer linger 0 //fe, I can no longer trust in you I can no longer trust in you A friend is no longer a friend A beloved is no longer a beloved 0 //fe, I can no longer trust in you I can no longer trust in you What's wrong, Sunder? Nothing The song reminds me of the singer That dying man loved her so much Who? The woman who ruined his life by marrying his friend I'm not amazed at the girl, Radha I'm amazed at the friend, Gopal How could he go to his friend's fiancée and say "| love you"? "| love you" He should have died... ...the way that poet died... ...with the girl's name on his lips, her memory in his heart The poet managed to express his feelings in his song But, friend... There are some who suffer as much but remain silent They can say nothing. I had better go I told you once before, I'll say it again today Don't come to my house... ...even if Sunder calls you I beg you Don '2‘ come to my house... ...e ven if Sunder cal/s you I beg you Sir, Mrs. Mehra had called many times. She has said that you reach the party by eight. I have kept your clothes ready. I do not wish to go to the party. And listen, if anyone asks for me tell them I am not at home. Even if Sunder comes tell him the same thing. Okay. You'll never change. Always late Have you ever thought of those who wait for you? What is it? You didn't even notice my lovely sari - It's beautiful - Without looking? I'll look and say: it's nice, very nice, first-class Don't sit down, Sunder. We're already late - So what if we're a little late? - It'll be terrible Wg Cdr Mehra is throwing a party for our wedding anniversary Come on, get ready He's invited a lot of people I'm in no mood for a party What's this? You're sitting down? What happened to you today? Don't ask, Radha What's happened today has never happened before Gopal saw me and turned his back away I called out to him He heard me but pretended not to hear I followed him home and was told he wasn't in - I am stunned - Can I ask you something? Why do you keep going to Gopal? If he avoids us, why should we chase him? - He's my friend, Radha! - ls he? You are his friend From now on, I won't go to his house or invite him to ours There are other houses we can go to, other people we can meet Get up! Change your clothes And change your mood too What is this? My eye's twitching How does this necklace look? It's nice. But what's this? Nothing is matching VVhy? You look like a queen, not the wife of a soldier like me What shall I wear, then? Why don't you wear that set of... Here's the key. I'll wear whatever you choose - Why are you cross? - You never like what I wear Not at all, they're lovely, first-class Go and get it "When you read my love letter... "...d0n't be angry "You are my life "You are my devotion "You are my sacred Ganges "You are my scared Jumna "You are so precious to me "l think of you as my very own "And if I die, my soul will wander restlessly...

I'll say we're on our way Yes, it's me He's just arrived We're leaving We'll be there in 15 minutes Yes, we're coming I said we'd be there in 15 minutes But we must leave now Mrs. Mehra is so odd. Her parties are like a military parade Sit here! Don't stand there, sit! Why are you sitting? Stand up Eat this, eat that She loves feeding people She should be put in charge of the Mess What's this? Still not ready? Think of all those people waiting for us. Let me You look good Shall we go? I forgot my handkerchief Picking up your handkerchief? Why did you need an excuse? I was just wondering...why did you have to tear it up? What should I have done? Kept it safe all my life? Why did you keep it till now? To show it to you To show it to me? Then why tear it up? Why did you tear it up? I got scared - Of whom? - Of you VVhy? You might have misunderstood - Who wrote it? - I told you, I don't know! Tell me the truth. Who wrote it? I told you the truth, I don't know! - When did you get it? - You weren't here Before the wedding... you were at the front Why didn't you show it to him then? - To whom? - Gopal What could Gopal do?

I just don't know what to say You should have said it was Gopal It's not easy to say that, Gopal He brought out his loaded revolver It's not me he wants to shoot but the man who wrote the letter Then let the gun empty its bullets I'll go to Sunder and tell him everything "l wrote the letter but Radha is yours, yours alone" How long can three lives be tormented?

You want to say there's no place for me here Isn't that what you think? So say it Say, "Radha, there's no place for you here any more" If you want, kill me. Throw me out of the house But for God's sake, stop this song! I can't take its poisoned arrows I can't take it You don't like this song? I won't sing it, then I'm 90mg Where? I don't know Are you leaving your house? Are you leaving me? Don't go, Radha Don't leave your home, Radha Don't leave your home You know, all my happiness, my life, my love is in this house It is all in your love I can't live without you... ...but I can't live with you I can't bear to see you so unhappy, Sunder I married you to bring you joy, not sorrow And when you... You haven't given me sorrow I've given it to myself But why? Do I need to tell you? Then how can I help relieve your pain? What can I do to make you trust me? I swear that since we got married... ...not even a shadow of another entered my mind Look at me. Look into my eyes What do you see? I see only love in your eyes. Love and truth But when I touch you... ...| feel that someone else touched your body before me Then I start to burn with jealousy I burn in its flames I'm haunted by the demons of suspicion Their shadows chase me, tear me to pieces Sometimes you seem like a shadow too And I start suspecting you. And then I cannot control myself All the foundations of my life begin to crumble I don't know what to do I can't be angry with you. Yet I can't blame anyone else Tell me, what can I do? What can I do? I feel like putting this gun to my head and blowing my brains out The bullet was fired I only managed to cling to Sunder and the gun swerved What am I to do now, Gopal? I can't live without Sunder, I can't live with him The |etter's like a dagger in his hand, he plays with it night and day Sometimes he stabs his own heart, sometimes mine One can bear one‘s own suffering But I can't bear to see him suffer That's why I want to... Have you gone mad? I just came to tell you to look after your friend He has only two things in his life: my love and your friendship My |ove's overcast by doubt But he can still live for your friendship Look after him Radha's gone, Gopal Radha is gone? Why don't you say she ran away? Yes, Sunder! Radha's run away! And she's run away from you! Here she is You, here? I'll tell you Radha ran away from your cruelty My cruelty? How would you know who wronged whom? Ask her what hell she left me in and came here You don't know how I've been hurt I can't conceal the hurt any more How could I tell you that my trust's been shattered? She's done it. Radha, my wife! - It's a lie! A lie! - A lie? Is it a lie? Then ask her, Gopal Who is the man whose shadow is cast over our lives? The man whose life Radha values more than hers or mine Who is he? Ask her who he is Don't ask her, ask me! I know whose life Radha cherishes more than any other life And I know whose shadow is cast on your life No, Gopal! You know, Gopal? I know the man who wrote that letter Who? I wrote it, Sunder, I did! Now hear why I wrote it I was in love with Radha It's a |ie...it‘s a lie It's a lie! A lie! Radha, say it's a lie Gopal, just once, lie to me and tell me it's a lie It's a lie, my friend! The tragedy is that it's not a lie I didn't have the courage to speak the truth Now you don't have the courage to hear it The truth is that I loved Radha very deeply Just as deeply as you did The difference was that you said it and I didn't For years that love smouldered in my heart... ...but never found expression in words Because you loved Radha. You,Sundeﬂ And you were my friend I kept silent because of our friendship When the news of your death broke out, so did my love Radha and I were going to get married Then we got the news that you were alive S0 I stepped back, Sunder I sacrificed love for friendship And Radha became yours, yours alone The day Radha entered your house, she was as pure as the River Ganges And today she left your house just as pure Now take your gun and shoot me Wonderful, Gopal Another sacrifice Standing on your lofty tower, throwing alms to the beggar But I'm not a beggar. I'm your friend I was your friend. But you didn't understand If you had, none of this would have happened If you had told me how you felt... If you had let the fire out of your heart... ...these three lives would not have been consumed by its flames What you have done for me, you sh0u|d've let me do, friend If you had said the word, I'd have stepped out of your way Gopal, what have you done? Anyway...but we can turn back the time What was ruined before can happen now No, it can't happen. It can't. I tell you and I tell you You who loved me and you who married me Who gave you the right to dictate my life once again? What do you both think I am? It's true that I loved you But I'm not the first girl in the world to have loved Love is a compulsion. lthappens Marriage is a duty that one must nurture, and I've nurtured it Love may suffer, weep, smoulder... ...but duty is a rock, not wax And I'm not wax either, Sunder Not a market commodity that goes from one master to another Wonderful First, one friend offers me as a sacrifice Then the other does No, Radha. No more sacrificing The one who should go is going Before you go, tell me where I should go What do I do with my bridal mark? If I remove it, who can ever make me a wife again? And these bangles... who shall I ask to make me wear them again? Tell me! Look at me I am the one you took home as a bride Remember the marriage vows which you made before God Should the man who took those vows... ...burn in flames all his life? No, Radha. Taking marriage vows together isn't love Nor is the union of two bodies A true union, Radha... ...is when two hearts meet When two souls meet and become God Our union is not a true union A true union was between you and Gopal Gopau Gopau What have you done, Gopal? What have you done, Gopal? Sunder... nothing It's nothing One of us three had to go The one who has to go is going No, Gopal|! No! You used to say one should always cry on a friend's shoulder And a friend should lend a shoulder on the last journey My friend, you left the city I'm leaving the world On leaving, you asked me to promise you one thing Now, I'm asking you to promise me something Take Radha back to her paradise True union is between the sacred rivers Ganges and Jumna And so the river Saraswati had to vanish You are my sacred Ganges, You are my sacred Jumna You are my sacred Ganges, You are my sacred Jumna You are so precious to me I think of you as my very own And /f/ die, my soul... ... will wander restless/y, waiting for you Waiting for you May you never be angry with me May you never be angry with me
