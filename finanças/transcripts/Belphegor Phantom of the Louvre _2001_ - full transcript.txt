- Youssef, go get help. - Yes, professor. Second of June. Egyptologist Pierre Desfontaines makes an unusual discovery, a tomb over three thousand years old. Containing an untouched sarcophagus. June ninth, we board the Sirius, with the sarcophagus and the mummy. The expedition is over. We sail for Marseilles. Final destination: The Louvre Museum. June thirteenth. Desfontaines told me about the discovery of the mummy inside the sarcophagus. June fourteenth. The Egyptologist walks in his sleep most every night. The crew is terrified. It's as if they're in the grips of a strange virus. Hallucinations, fits of madness, suicides. June fifteenth. I decide to come out of my cabin. I'm the last survivor aboard. Professor Desfontaines? My God. Desfontaines. Louvre Museum lt was found in a forgotten store room of the old Louvre during the renovation. New Kingdom, surely. Rameses period. It's truly remarkable. According to the files, the sarcophagus was sent here in nineteen thirty-five, by a certain Pierre Desfontaines, an in-house Egyptologist. This kind of vault is that of a... a lowly functionary, but take a look at these inscriptions. The kind only royalty would get. And, even stranger, his name and his face have been erased. Open it. The bandages are intact but there's not one jewel, not one amulet. It's not possible. - Perhaps they just forgot. - Impossible. I'm telling you. For the Egyptians, these objects were necessary for the journey to the afterlife. That grayish spot there, what is that? Looks like metal to me. Well I'm glad we have new equipment. I don't know that painting. Oh, the Mona Lisa, you never heard of it. What the hell is that? Felix. Felix. Call central. Oh Christ! What is this shit? Something in the electrical system. Watch out, the gate! Call Miss Spencer about the hieroglyphics. - Souvenir picture of the Louvre? - No. I'm the director. Now... You just call Miss Spencer. At the British, right sure. Uh, Amanda? That it? Glenda Spencer. Hey! What the hell? What is this shit? What the hell are you doing? Come on Grammy, back to bed. Get off of my back. Oh, no you'll wind up in the hospital again. Never, you promised me. All right, I'm going. So, the wanton soup tonight. No something low in fat. Want some spring rolls? How about if I hired a nurse? - You're a nurse for me. - Oh no, you're the nurse. Saved my life staying here with you. Hey come on this has to end. You should be I don't know going out and around but you must forget that dirt bag please. You're right! But give me some time. Okay. My darling. - You know I'm convalescing, too. - Sure. I could never stomach him. But I loved him, so... Yeah right, well I loved him. Hi, Missus Mozovska. - So how is your grandmother? - All right. She's recovering slowly. Not again. Construction? First the museum across the street now the parking lot. Keep this up, the building will fall down. Have a good day. Lisa, are you home sweetheart? She is such a bitch. You've been renting this shop for forty years and now she throws us out on the street! She doesn't want me out, she wants more money! Same thing! The perfume business isn't what it used to be. So we need more da da da da... We'll figure something out. What're we gonna do? - Ah perfect. - Shit! Candles are in the bottom drawer. Electrician twenty-four seven. Nothing just the usual power surge. Another two seconds, I'm done. You know, I kind of liked it with the candles. A bit like a funeral home, yeah. Oh come on. Please. You know, that boy's pretty cute, isn't he? Well look at him. What? - There you are. - Hooray. I pressed the same buttons but I guess I did something wrong. Oh, come on I'm sure there's stuff you know how to do. She can do everything sure. Right, darling, there's nothing you can't do. Well you've earned it. How about a glass of Beychevelle nineteen ninety-two? - No, that's nice but I don't want to impose. - Please impose. He doesn't want to impose. Here come on have a seat. You know, I've always had lots to eat, lots to drink and lots to smoke a bit too much if you ask Lisa. Right, darling? Sure. But as for men believe it or not, there's only ever been one. Telling him the story of your life? The people I know, my darling, they've already heard it. They get bored silly. But maybe he wants to listen. Sure, sure I want to hear it, sure. There! He would like to listen. - Now please take your glass, all right? Let's toast. - I'd be glad to, cheers. He'd be glad to, darling, have a drink with us. This one's had a long voyage. Ask me, he's aged pretty well Thirty-five hundred years old as the particle accelerator makes it out. I don't suppose you have all these new technologies at the British? Alas no. No, we English still have our old fashioned methods. Intuition. Scientific deduction. And conclusion. All right, Glenda, we're counting on you here. You haven't invited me to dinner. Of course one day soon! I'd be glad to! That's the Louvre? Yes. Do you ever go? Oh I guess I must have twenty years ago maybe more. Every weekend I think about it. No I'm not kidding. His is an excellent place to watch the Tour de France. If that interests you. Kind sir. - Your grandmother's a live wire. - Yeah, sure is I'm never bored with her! Never seen a private home with so many books. - Are you a big reader? - No. I mean apart from manuals, instruction booklets. Grammy? Grammy! Grammy, are you all right? Grammy, wake up! - Wake up, Grammy. - It's all right. - This can't be happening. This can't be happening. - It's all right, it's all right. An ambulance, I'm going to call. Should we wait for the family or go ahead? I am the family. Ah you're here? Nice of you. You got time for coffee? Thanks, I have to go see my landlord who's throwing me out of the store. Yeah right there are days. Well, you do what you have to do. But look you just call me if you feel burned out or something. Thanks. First time I open a mummy. Not like the ones we get... at the morgue. I'm used to a little heat when I open one. I hope you're not too squeamish about it. No, that's all right. I did some work for the Red Cross once. So, subject is male. According to the scan about thirty years old, height, five foot nine. Request chemical analysis of entrails. Entrails mummified separately in canopied wrappings. Looks like bronze. Is that customary? The mask? No, it's not. It's not customary, I've never seen this before. We'll have to have it dated. Gross examination of the cranium; Extensive bruising in the left parietal region, a knife wound. Subject alive when this occurred. It also caused a deformation of the left ocular orbit. All right... - Will you look at that catastrophe? - Where's the construction site? Behind there, about thirty feet. Better limit access down there. Michel, cut the main circuits. - And the hole? You have to plug the hole! - Nope. You'll have to wait for the adjuster. But we put some struts in for safety. Jesus, Mary and Joseph, we'll have rats! Missus Spencer, I just wanted to say I loved what you wrote on Akhenaton. See, I'm into Egyptology we have the same specialty, too, New Empire. You don't say. Well, I'm an amateur, I've done, done research in mummification, the cult of the dead and all... I have a lot to learn, l... A security guard with a passion! - Rameses dynasty? - Exactly. The twentieth. Analysis has revealed the fact that his death was a poisoning. And so we have to put it together. The death with the evidence. I'm the detective. Has he been identified? The painted inscriptions would suggest he was probably of royal status, a religious dignitary but somehow without a name, a total stranger to us. Names are essential to the Egyptians. Oh, you are a very good student. Would you like some? Thanks! It's tea with a bite to it. You'll see. - And was that draped over his face when you opened it? - No. It's just a cloth. Oh, I should warn you, this may give you nightmares. The poor dear. He took a nasty little blow to the head. Maybe I could work with you. On my day off, you know? I could help you out. Oh, that's very sweet but I don't need any help. Know your place, that it? Know your place, no not at all. I only meant that well, well, l... That's nothing. Just the spectrometer. Did you say spectrometer? What is that? For ghosts? No, no, it measures the magnetic field. Oh, the ceremonial costume of our mummy? Thank you, thank you! It's a reconstitution made from a tiny fragment of cloth. Electrician twenty-four seven. Oh, hi. I'm sorry. It's out again?! Be right there, don't touch anything. It blew for no reason. I couldn't turn it back on I thought you had repaired it. Well it must be the breakers for the building. Oh yeah, they cut some circuits. You doing all right? You bearing up? Yeah, fine. All right, I see. They shut down the fuse blocks for the hallway and lobby, of course. What are they, working nights? They're behind schedule. Pussy cat... Here pussy cat. All right, it's back on. What's she doing there? Hey, wait up! Where you going? You tell me. I'm done. The electricity is back on. Oh my God, this is so gross. No, hey serious, let's go back. Hey, hey. You have no business on this job site. - Well yeah... but see because... - The exit's up that way. Okay. Okay. Move it up now. Okay. Clear. Now we're completely lost. I guess it's up this way. - You there, where are you going? - Shit. Go! This way. Come on, Over here, over here! - That's all we needed. - Take the tour? Sure, tomorrow. We'll stand in line and buy a ticket! Hey, the Louvre all to ourselves! It's magical. We're going to get caught! They have guards and alarms all over the place. They'll think we're stealing something. Hey, come on we're not. Let's go. Okay, all right. Five fifteen to central. That's the main gallery. Alert main gallery. Wait come on, this way. Very pretty. You come here a lot? Yeah, with my grandmother. That's it? Never saw it in person. She does have a nice smile. Electrician twenty-four seven. Hey, no time for that! Yeah, no I'm sorry you'll have to call back later. - Shit. - Oh my God. There! Louvre level minus one. Please... What're you doing here? Who are you? I was looking for the exit. I'm not doing anything. I'm lost. Did you set off the alarms? No. Yes. Maybe, I don't know. I live across the street, I can explain. - The electricity went out, I went to the basement and... - All right, let's go. Five fifteen to central. I'm moving toward the lab now. Right corridor. Near the fire door, up the stairs. Five fifteen to central. I got another shadow in the Sully area. What are you doing here? Where were you? I looked all over. What happened? I don't know, I don't know what happened. I don't know what happened. Boy, really got to you, huh? It was the mummy. The mummy? It was in the lab, I saw it. Horrible, the face had a hole in it and when I got up close to it, it was like somebody turned out the lights, I don't know... When I do repairs in the middle of the night sometimes I see weird stuff. That was a little like parachute jumping without a chute. You're right to leave this apartment, you know. Too many memories. Here you should read this, it changed my life. This book? Give me a chance. I'll change your life, too. That's no job for an electrician, that's mission impossible. - Look Lisa, I realize it's not the moment but... - No it's not the moment. No. Right, sure. Well, well, I'll wait for your lights to blow again. You mind staying over? Just to sleep I don't m... No one waiting for you? Here. Hey, what's wrong come on! - What's the matter Simonnet? - I'm allergic to those animals you know! What happened last night anyway? - He saw the boogie man? - Quit it. - What did he see a ghost? The phantom of the Louvre? - Just quit it. Somethings a man doesn't joke with. Mangin, the security report showed there were intruders on the rounds last night? - Did you find out what happened? - Not yet but I will. The inquiry is underway. Going through all these documents? I'm looking for anything that Desfontaines could've left in the archives. If I keep going I just know I'm going to find something, the name of this mummy, for example. Luxor. We were young. I miss it. Do you really? Yeah, well, I miss the digs. You have any regrets? What? Like when you took my car and left me at the Pyramids? Ah, Suzanne dear, have the Dutch arrived? Yes. But there's also a reporter here, about the electrical problems, asking a lot of questions. The ramifications for security. Bingo! Look, Professor Desfontaines kept a journal! My name's Marco. Yours is Lisa? Yes. Martin told me a lot about you. Want something, you thirsty? Yes. Two cokes here, please. Hey, what's the matter? Lisa! Lisa, what's going on, hey? Look I'm sorry I gotta go this was a mistake. I'm not ready yet. Well, you can't just go, come o... What's with her? I don't know, she lost her grandmother. - You sure that's all it is? - I have no idea. She won't tell me anything. Three thirteen to control. I'm hearing weird noises. Jerry what's on your screen? NYPD Blue. - No dummy, not the TV screen, the surveillance screen. - Nothing moving. Now the detectors and the cameras are affected by these freaking outages. Three ten to control. Everything secure in the crypt. Three thirty-one to control. Nothing up on the roof. Still scared of your ghost? - You don't believe it either? - Sure I do. I've lived with ghosts my whole life. My grandfather was a gravedigger. Used to bring me to the cemetery, I'd help him dig graves, he told me about zombies. Ankou, they called him in Brittany. My family... the great soul reaper was Baron Saturday. Baron Saturday? Tell me about it. No, in this context I better not. That's him. The phantom. Stay there watch your fanny. Don't move man! He's right behind you. Hello? Yeah, it's me. Weren't you at home last night, what happened? I was off. I mean I took something to help me sleep, it's just been terrible. Sure but why'd you leave? I was worried. - I felt bad. I got spooked. - Spooked? Electric guitars are always shorting out. Hello, Lisa I can't hear you. - Hello? - Hello? Martin? No, come on, this is too much. Impossible. There's a problem with everything I touch. Hello Martin? You there? Hello? Hello Martin, where are you? Right here. Faster than a speeding bullet. You scared me to death. What is all this? Nothing's the same any more. It's Disneyland. No way! I told him I wouldn't work nights. I have no desire to meet a phantom. Come on, that's just a rumor. You ask me... The less you listen to rumors the better. They walk in off the street like at the British? Checked every point of access? With all these outages, the cameras and the alarms weren't working. Yeah, but that's why we have guards here for god's sakes! Yeah, well now, those guards... are scared. What are we running here a nursery? If it's burglars that frighten the guards then why don't they guard a park? Or a quarterback or guard a forest! - But it isn't the burglars that scare the guards. - Yeah? Well what is it? Well, there's talk of a phantom. Let me see they want shorter hours, higher wages and phantom insurance. Phantoms! Go over everything again. The elevators, broom closets, toilets, I don't want one cockroach left in here. Ladies and gentlemen, the Egyptology Gallery is temporarily closed to the public. Thank you. So something not right with your security? - You a reporter? - No, but I read the reports, file them away. - Mysterious goings-on at the Louvre. - Don't believe everything you read. Museum security's tip-top. American technology. - I'm Mangin, I manage the security. - Verlac, veteran, well retired. Because this might not be America. But it might soon become a little like Vietnam. - You're exploring your records? - Yes. Desfontaines discovered there was a tomb when he found a ring, you see. It's all recorded in his journal. Here, see that's it. Lt has a royal seal but Desfontaines never managed to read it. It was in the valley of the kings, another site, in the desert. That's where the ring was. Well, I suppose it was stolen at the time the mummy was buried but... - Then the ring must be in our reserves. - No. No one's found it. But we have to get that ring. Without it we'll never know the real identity of our mysterious mummy. There's got to be an explanation. Well, I mean you know... Certain people stop watches and set off metal detectors. I mean... Could be that, right? A magnetic field, you know? Sure I guess. Love at first sight. That's what causes it. I'm sorry. I should've warned you I'm not into this kind of S and M trip, you know? I'm not sure what happened it was like he ordered me to do all that stuff and... - Stuff. What stuff? - Kill you. I got it But I report it the next time you try to kill me, understand? Come on, stop joking for one minute. Hey, look I almost got murdered here, I'm just looking for a way to take the edge off okay? I want your medical history right now. If you've ever been treated, I won't go mental but... Okay. I'm insane. That must be it. Must be it. Level minus two. Have you seen Miss Spencer? We had a dinner appointment but there's nobody up in the lab now. No, but I was about to call you. You think you're in the trenches or... The phantom. We've just spotted him. The phantom. Just perfect. Hat's about enough for me. Get everyone on it now. Cut off all exits to the museum and comb every floor. Oh, don't worry, the phantom'll be caught. Guaranteed Hello! - Mangin to control. Nothing so far. - Continuing recon. No, no. Not the hornets. Not the hornets! Ah, ah, please no! Twinkle twinkle little star how I wonder what you are. Lisa. Lisa? She can't have left in the middle of the night! I can't believe this. The death of our esteemed Mangin was an accident. That's obvious. Obvious. The poor guy was afraid of a ghost. We have to put an end to this absurd and puerile rumor. - What about the busted windows? - Another Egyptian amulet was stolen. Third in a week. That just proves he's a thief, one who specializes in stealing works of art, and as you might imagine if one of you turns out to be his accomplice, there'll be hell to pay. Hello. Mister Faussier? I finally managed to reach the police chief. I'll put him through. Bertrand, you know what time it is? What's going on? Excuse me Francois but this is rather urgent. The reputation of the Louvre is in danger. It's a very delicate matter. Now I'm going to need a detective, someone discreet, and efficient. You're looking at the guy for the job. But officer come now, how long ago did you retire? I'm fixing up a decrepit old place in the country and I putter in the garden, raising vegetables, the asparagus is looking good this year. But when the police chief gives me an assignment, I obey. You're here to replace our chief of security. He passed away. Right. Got his skull bashed in diving off the highboard, sure. That's just the beginning huh? It'll get worse. It better not, you were assigned precisely for that reason. All of these incidents happened in the ancient section. Oh, the ancients, huh? Well I'm one. But I'm making a comeback. He had his turn... but this time I'm gonna collar Belphegor. Belphegor, whatever is that? Random House page sixteen hundred and ten between 'Bellamy'and 'Ben Hur'. I'm surprised a man like you... Sure that's very flattering but just what is this uh... Belphegor? Look Belphegor is not a kind of soap. He's the devil inside a human. He's Lucifer, Lucifer when he takes on a body. - Morning. - You all right? Sleep well? - Sort of. - Where? - Why do you ask that? - Because you weren't there anyway. Hey, come on. What are you talking about? You asked me to stay here. You're better off hiring a bodyguard. They won't let me give them birdseed anymore. Could you do it? I'm looking for someone to care. I'm not looking to be spied on. Yeah, well, I'm not looking for this at all. Look we'd do better to call it quits, okay? All right, fine, I'm going. So that's the end? Wait... the end of what? Excuse me, I must've missed the beginning. Three hundred thousand works of art. Two thousand four hundred windows. Ten thousand steps of stairway. This one knew the splendors of the Second Empire. Don't buy this at lKEA. No. A national treasure. It's genuine. They say Du Barry slept in it. Oh, her. Just another girl in love with the boss. Right yes, I'm a caricature. And so you you'll really be staying in this dusty corner? I like to be in a corner. They forget about you but you're still around. You observe from behind the scenes you're part of the woodwork. You discover truths. There's nothing better in my job than a corner. Truth is, the case of the Louvre ruined my life. I was so obsessed with it that burglaries, crimes... were no longer important to me. Then one morning they put me away in a corner, but of another species. No more promotion but I knew the time would come, I never doubted that the beast would strike again one day and who do you think they go looking for then? Their old friend, Verlac! Hey, the art guys another accident? Starting to look like Police Story. Coffee all around, I'm buying. And I'll have strawberry milk. I'm Lieutenant Verlac. I'm back here today to pick up my old case at the Louvre. There were guys stalking about twenty years ago when I was new here. A specter dressed in black uh... at night. Accidents, no explanation... l guess that was uh... back in the sixties, right? Right, I was there... Somebody named Blanchard, a guard, was the guy who opened the wrong door. Someone there? A series of electrical outages... And then one day well one night... Hey, who left that there? A midnight patron. I was a young detective, dumb and green, they gave me the Belphegor case. A god. Well a devil, and not exactly a kosher one. The guards were all cracking up, then one day... Don't look back! Don't look back! I was standing right next to the poor guy, then suddenly... something terrible happened. Tutankamen live in person, about to croak in my arms. They all said it was a guard dressed as a ghost, well... here's a first. The phantom was dressed as a guard. Belphegor. Looks like what the mummy was wearing. The man in the iron mask. Someone know his name? We don't know yet. That's part of what I've been researching. Where was it found? Oh, in a disused room in the Sully area I think so anyway. Just where they saw the phantom when he blew in the first time. Are you saying he's been here before? Oh, there's a first time for everything. But that goes way back. Back when the Beatles had just released Sergeant Pepper. I was dancing every night in nightclubs wearing a skirt that was this big. - Well, youth is wonderful. - Wonderful yeah. An incurable disease. Janis Joplin, Jimmy Hendrix. Jim Morrison. Lost destiny, every one. Brings tears to my eyes. But everyone was once young. And you are still here. That's the problem. Now, uh... now we're in Egyptology. Now this is a portico from the tomb of an Egyptian king. That was very important since it was the false door which separated the living from the dead. This is the Stela of Amenwassoo which is about three thousand years old. Miss, what's the comic? That's a papyrus. It's called the book of the dead but you're still a bit young for that. It's the story of morning. Look, the sun rises, symbolizing the triumph of life over death. Re, the sun god, moves across the sky to the west. His solar boat is gliding down the celestial river and reaches the netherworld at evening. It moves through the portal... to the kingdom of shadow. - C'mon, shall we go? - No. But the god named Apopis, or the snake god, is after the sun god. The door keeper of the twelve hours of night and he has to confront him every morning so the sun will rise. You follow me? - Sure. You must teach history. - No. So how come you know all that? I have no idea, but apparently I know it. Okay, follow me, children let's go see the mummified animals. Hey, lady! Hey, lady! I drew a picture of what you said. Let's see. That's the god Osiris and that's the sun god. You should be ashamed! Shame on you. Shame on you! - My notebook! - Hey, is there something wrong with you?! He confused Osiris with Apopis, his mortal enemy. - Hey, you are out of control. - You should be ashamed. So, you have visual and auditory hallucinations. Any sudden changes of mood? I can't sleep and I'm always on edge. Doesn't bother anyone. I live alone. And you've lived alone for too long. - Well my grandmother just died. - This isn't about Genevieve. You were six years old when your parents were killed. - Yeah, so? - You remember it? It was a car accident, right? I was thrown from the car and when I woke up I was already in the hospital. - And Genevieve was with you? - Yes. We'll start by taking some magnesium, and a mild traquilizer to help you sleep. It's just a depression. Is that what you're saying? - You probably should have someone to talk to. - A shrink? Attention. Intruder in Egyptology. Scribe room. No, no-no-no-no! Simonnet, no! It's true. I'm afraid of dogs but... this one! I never saw one like that. You believe me, don't you? ...Course I do sure, once he figured out your phobia. Belphegor just projected it in cinemascope it's a defense mechanism. - Bob, you're coming with me, huh? - Right here. - You get hit? You all right? - No, it's not that. I'm just squeamish about shots. Have you seen the papers? Mysterious deaths at the Louvre. - Here, here, look at this. - No, don't worry about it Miss Valette, the medieval painting and religious art section is not involved. Our supposed phantom has a burning passion for Egyptology. He likes the twentieth dynasty of the New Empire. That's his specialty. But the Louvre is a sanctuary. Our heritage depends upon... Right and that's precisely why I've decided as of today to place the museum under maximum security Yeah, right! And put up barbed wire fences! And where are you going? Oh, well... huh, I'm going to take a nap now you know I'm a little worn around the edges. Good luck with the maximum security, but I warn you, it won't help catch our perp. Yeah, but catching him is up to you! - Any progress yet? - No, I'm waiting for the next victim. I want the sarcophagus put here next to the false door. What are you doing here? I'm reconstructing the tomb. Look Glenda the job description I gave you when you arrived was pretty clear. But that's just how I work, you see? First I assemble, then compare and I put it all together so I see what is missing. Because my role is to understand things. You're just after success. How are you doing on the identification of the mummy? Your mummy was apparently related to a pharoah. He was a distinguished member of the clergy of Amon Re. But the absence of a name and jewelry would make the inhumation ceremony impossible. So, conclusion: The funeral had to have been sabotaged. Sabotaged? By who and why? Well one would have to suppose so the poor soul would wander helplessly until the end of time. Well, I've heard about the wandering Jew but Egyptians wandering I never heard that. Lisa, you there? Oh forget this! I'm worried, too. Such a nice girl she is. But I mean when you live in a dead woman's apartment. Yes, but... and every night she's down in the cellar. Oh? Are you sure? And she stays there for hours! June twelfth. The crew is in the grips of a strange virus. Hallucinations, fits of madness, suicides. Excuse me. - Intruder Sully area. - Well this time, I got a good gun. - How do you get in here at night? - I hid at closing time. I wanted to see the museum alone, I don't like crowds. Don't bullshit us, all right? Ah, fuck... that's boiling hot! Rather have ice? Okay, give me his lD. - You're a cop, right? - No, but don't tell Rodney King. So you little piece of shit you like killing our guys, huh? Like Felix's buddy Simonnet? If you're the phantom then I'm going to haunt you! Stop this bullshit. I don't know any Belphegor. That's enough. Let me handle him. Try to understand, they're just... they're just a bit cranky at the moment now here... You know that beast now don't you, huh? - Stop. I don't know what you're talking about. - Belphegor. Three thirteen. Phantom spotted near the storage area. - You see him now? - Affirmative. Don't move a muscle, nothing. We're on our way. I've been waiting a long time for this! I have the target in range. - Should I plug him? - That's the worst thing you could do! - He made me! - Don't look at him! - Get some cover! - He disappeared. Whatever you do, don't look him in the eyes! Not the tongue. Come on, not in the tongue! Not the tongue! Victim lD Robert Guerini. Notify his family. Miss Bastet. Miss Bastet. Dinner is served. You're lucky, you have nine lives. You know the secret of eternity. The Egyptians revered you like gods. Us mortal men, we pass through and then we're trampled in the dust. If you look in the eyes of Belphegor one second, you'll go nuts so take my advice, don't you ever under any circumstances meet eyes with that creature. Okay. Hear me? Never! Yeah, all right, sure, okay. Now, middle of the night, what were you doing at the Louvre? - Hey, look detective... No, I'm only a lieutenant. I never made detective because of Belphegor. I promised not to say. Well I was hoping I wouldn't be forced to bring you in but well... So give me a call! Ah, it's you. Last time I looked. - That's you, are you sure? - Yeah. Come in. - I followed you last night. - Followed me? I was only trying to protect you, now... please don't go back there. It's too dangerous. - Back where? - To the Louvre. There's a killer loose, some kind of phantom. Look it's really crazy, all these stories, but people are dying, real people, made of flesh and blood. The book... It's beautiful, the kingdom of the dead. I had a dream last night. My grandmother held me in her arms. She was pretty, and young... like when she came to get me. - Ever heard about Belphegor? - What? Sounds nice. Look Lisa, promise me you won't go back to the Louvre. You must think I'm crazy. You say this, and I'm the one who's crazy. Let me go to work. Sure go ahead. Have a great day. Of the two obelisks, one is in Paris at the Place de la Concorde. The other stayed at the site in Luxor, not far from the Valley of the Kings where the inhumation of our mummy took place. Someone tried to wipe out his name. Pierre Desfontaines was led to the discovery of the tomb by a ring stamped with a dynastic seal, found nearby. In Deir el Medina he unearthed plans indicating the royal tomb's exact location. - The tomb was then discovered, a few months... - Uh excuse me please. I think I discovered a hieroglyph. Lovely. Class we have a new Champollion. You may not know it, but I published a dictionary which contains all known hieroglyphs. - Right I know but you must have missed mine. - Very well. I invite you to the blackboard. Show us your discovery. Use the projector if you like. That's a boat? Well, I don't know what it is but... you gotta have balls to do that. You're absolutely right, you know. That hieroglyph is unknown to my knowledge. But Egyptian writing never stopped changing The scribes as they wrote would invent lots of new signs. Now this one combines a few different symbols bark, river, return, netherworld. Any one have any ideas? Go ahead. Well, maybe it's a spirit that's crossing the river toward the kingdom of the dead. Okay and let's say that this wandering spirit cannot cross the river. How about that? Like the mummy you were talking about there? How long have you studied here at the Louvre? The surveillance camera's up. You can install it. Tell me. Why are they raising their hands? It's a ritual observed by all Egyptians. A proud salute to the rising sun. Each figure represents another character in the story told. Shit. Sorry. Come on. Let's go. Lieutenant! Aren't you on sick leave? - ...against all kinds of risks, including... - Sure yeah but I'm obsessed with that beast of yours. I'm not surprised. Hey, once it grabs you... I get it now. That vision was a message sent to me from another world. The dog was the god Anubis you see, I guard the tomb. The keeper of the tomb is me. - Because his real name you see is not Belphegor! - No I'm sure it's not, but don't worry I'm going to run his prints through lnterpol, okay... - Beware! - Yeah. Provoking the forces of evil can be dangerous! So... Where did you find your new hieroglyph? Well... - A friend of mine just... she discovered it somehow. - Discovered it? She should be given the Nobel Prize. Or else she's Ramses three's scribe come back from the dead. Like reincarnation? You believe in that? Oh, come on, I was kidding. Let me ask you this. Did the Egyptians think people got messages from beyond the grave? Sort of a symbolic message? Yeah a message of distress you know? Well, there is something in traditional lore. If you'd like to see it, come on. It's in the book of the dead. Miss. You frightened me Recognize me? Yeah, you work at the Louvre. Rumor has it there's a phantom. Have you heard that? No. Don't worry, you can trust me. We understand each other. Hey, I got plenty of stuff about ancient Egypt, okay? Documents. We'll figure it out. Come back to my house. Leave me alone! Enough! We'll figure out the secret of eternal life! What's she doing? Lisa! Listen to me now! Lisa! Look! I don't know what's happening but look around! Egypt all over the place! Wow this is weird! Why do you follow me around like this?! All right, go home we're closing the graveyard. Leave me alone! I have to open it! - Are you a relative? - I have to go in! I have to! No, please! Let the dead rest in peace. What about us will the dead let the living rest in peace?! I can't picture Desfontaines as a serial killer. Oh, that's a little much, isn't it? According to the ship's doctor, the sole survivor, he rubbed out the whole crew and then died himself. Caught some weird virus while peeking in Cleopatra's grave. No. At the period of our mummy, Cleopatra wasn't born yet. Well me, apart from Walk Like an Egyptian, the Bangles song... Where is that? Well that's uh... That's his cabin. Desfontaines' cabin. Bingo. That's the same hieroglyph. But where could that boy have seen this hieroglyph? What boy? Uh, he was uh... pretty unusual. He told me of a friend who'd apparently discovered this hieroglyph. Would you mind removing your glasses? - Doesn't what I'm saying interest you at all? - Yeah. Sure but when you talk mummies all the time, after a while, it's contagious. You dry out. Pretty woman like yourself, that's a real crime. Why lieutenant. I'd almost swear you're flirting. Bingo. As you put it. Hey! Who turned out the lights?! Man! - Where'd she go? - I don't know, I didn't see her. - You didn't see her split? - No, I didn't see her! Lisa. Lisa, do whatever you want, go back to the Louvre, but just listen to me this once. An Egyptologist showed me the book of the dead. Know what it is? It says that... that a spirit can enter a living person's body and use him to get down to the netherworld. D'you really buy that stuff? I believe what's in front of me in what's happening right here and now. I mean you're not alone, okay? Yeah. We're always alone. Hey, look maybe it's the mummy, maybe that apartment or the ozone... but there's something creepy and you better get far away, huh. But I can't get away from my own body... It's impossible, l... Well I'm not going to just drop you we're going to beat this, okay? But why do all this for me? Because you're inside of me, too all right? - Got a cigarette, by any chance? - Yes. And a light? Samurai! Samurai, down boy. I saw the dog uh... jump on the driver and the girl in the raincoat took off. Which way did she go? Come on Lisa, l... Lisa! Eight thirteen for Verlac, code red. We've got an emergency call from central intruder in Egyptology again, something stirring in the crypt. Just when it was getting interesting. Belphegor... Him again. Stay with him, huh! No! Lisa! No! This way sir! You won't get away that easy! She's dead. Now you satisfied? I'm starting to get the phantom's profile. Female... what's her name, boy? What's her address? Across the street from the museum. They're working in the basement. All of a sudden he's forthcoming - About time! - It's all over. I got nothing left to protect. Oh, poor boy on an emotional roller coaster. You have a couple of hours rest here... and we'll talk tomorrow morning. Lieutenant what happened? A girl fell. She should've cracked her skull open, right about here but... no blood, nothing. No broken bones. This way sir. She gave me the keys. Something about going on a long trip, she said. But... it is of what you investigate? The mysteries of Paris my dear woman. Hum, don't worry. About an hour ago, your Lisa was fast asleep in her grandmother's apartment. What? I saw her fall. I was there. With Belphegor, you'll see a lot more. Hey, she was sleeping like a baby. I want to see her. Look, if you care for her, cooperate, don't be stupid. She's pretty but the beast is inside of her. To help her there's only one way, and that's help it with its mission. Its mission? To locate the seven amulets of the mummy and a certain door prize.. A ring with the mummy's name on it. Your Lisa will return... she'll return to the museum tonight. We're all waiting... for the lady to put on her mask. And then my boy it's up to you. Yeah, why me? Because you are... unless I'm mistaken the only one... who's able to look at her without being fried! Let's just keep her out of the Louvre. With what, a bazooka? No... Belphegor is programmed to aid the Egyptian in getting to the next world. Should he fail again... then it's fatal! - Fatal? Who would die? - Your Lisa. The beast inside her body would get ejected, and she'd get shrunk, dried out. Your pretty girl... mummified. Lieutenant! I've been looking for you. All I needed. I'll see you tonight. Don't try anything stupid. I'm trusting you. Take a look at what we found this morning on the Molien balcony. Huh? The mask the mummy had. Look, I just don't get it. That mask has been carefully locked away in the vault every night. Come on our beast can't be stopped by a wall. All right enough of this. Enough of your beast! We've wasted enough time already. I wanted a cop. Not a broken down old clown... You're right, you know? I guess I missed my calling. Well, go practice elsewhere. Come on, really what have you done since you got here? Huh... He's done nothing. Really. Okay, we're going to get serious now... We have work to do, I want to see you in my office. Your phantom is going to get a S.W.A.T. team right in the teeth. You and your... Belphegor! What do you want? Say it! What? Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it! Do whatever you want. Quickly. Like clockwork. What's she doing? She's zapping toward the ring. The ring with the name on it. Looks like she drew a blank. We'll have to soothe the beast. Now it's up to you kid. No! Do it, do it. Don't move! Don't be stupid. Remove to army hospital. Operation Louvre, all over! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Nobody could get a word out of her. She wouldn't even give me her name. You mind if I talk to her? Be careful. She's violent. I mean you no harm. I'm a friend of Martin's. - You know Martin, right? - Don't say anything. - He's here. He can hear you. - Who can? The other. Here. Inside my head. He hears you and speaks to you as well, doesn't he? Tell me what he says. Say it tell me what does he say? Help me. He's calling out for the rescue of his soul. He wants me to say his name but I don't know it. Will you help me? I will. That's why I came here today. His name, you know it. You know it. You know it. It reminds me... Try Lisa, lt reminds... Try. Yes, you can do it. It reminds you of what? This story I remember my grandmother used to tell. There was an evil spirit and nobody knew his name. It was forbidden to pronounce it. Even he wasn't allowed to say it. Yeah, and so? And so a prince is not afraid to look and one day he looks right at him and says his name, soothing him, and he returns to the beyond. Here, between them, right. That's fine. That's fine there. My God! The ring! That's it. The ring was buried with the Egyptologist? It's moving, I didn't know he was buried here. So is Jim Morrison. We'll go say hello to him later. We have the exhumation order! So, what's on the menu for today? The ring isn't here. Well he lost a few pounds. It might just be lying around. - Doctor, you mind? - Sure. Sorry, Mister Desfontaines. The royal seal of the Pharaohs. Can you read the name? Could you hold this? Now look out Nay, Eb, May, Esso. Nay. Eb Mayesse. Neb May, ur Mau, seer to the Pharaohs. Oh my God! We shot her full of sedatives. And look at the result. Can't help herself. She just has to get to the Louvre. Well, open up. - Careful, she's... - Sure, I know, I know... Lisa. Lisa, calm down. I want you to do something. Repeat after me. Neb, Mess, Ur, Mau. Neb Mes, Ur, Mau Ne Nebmess Ur Mau. Right. It's Coptic. Ancient Egyptian. A dead language. Nobody's used it for about two thousand years, so whose voice is it? A voice from beyond the grave. The phantom of the Louvre. Translation? She imploring us to proceed with the ceremony of passage. And what does that mean the ceremony of passage? It's the mummy's burial ceremony. Whereby his Ba, well, his soul, I mean, will arrive on the other side of the river, according to legend. When's the ceremony going to take place? When the moon's in it's last quarter. This very night. A tight schedule, we'll never get it in the obits. And no one's found the stolen amulets yet. You can't be serious? - You mean you're planning to actually... - Yes, we are, yes. Well, sure what else do you do with a wet back? Get him back across the river. That's the end of him. Do what you want but as for me, unscientific imaginings don't really suit my education. Well there isn't very much we can lose. It's just a ceremony. That's incredible! It's pretty realistic? Yeah. Yes, it's pretty realistic, The seven amulets stolen by Belphegor. For two thousand years he's been dead, and you're here today to borrow the Egyptian crypt we reopened a while ago, because he's going to the netherworld. Tell me that's not it. Well it appears that that's what the phantom requested. Well that's a very charitable mission, I'm sure but, but the phantom himself, well, herself... she is in prison. No? We let her out. The beast will fly into a rage. You, I seem to remember telling you to stay away from here. Come on, enough, just withdraw your complaint, we'll get Lisa out of jail and bring her here. Out of the question! No! Nein! Nyet! You're a criminal. We'll hold you responsible. If you're convicted of Belphegor, you'll get no parole, maximum security! Mister Faussier. Mister Faussier, look! They were downstairs! Oh... man, this is great! Great? Well, put those objects back on display right away. Great. Time for her shot. Give me five minutes. Boy, you get all the luck. Possessed by a spirit. If it was me, I would have made the first contact with the beyond, I'd discovered the secret of eternity. But hope springs eternal. Now, you die. The spirit will return to the mummy. And I'll be nested in your place. Time for her shot. Just give me five minutes. So you ever have kids? Well, I imagine there's one or two around. None that I've met anyway. Having a family, I wasn't made for it. But now and then you, you know you see some guy and think, I wouldn't have minded if he turned out to be my son. So what do we do here? Lisa gets mummified, trampled in the dust and we just sit here doing nothing. Lieutenant. It's for you. The army hospital. Yes? What? Be right there, all right. Prepare yourself for the great passage. No, I imagined it. Can't be happening again. Trying to scare me, Verlac? I know that's you! Come on! At your age? Dressing up like a kid. It's pathetic. All just to get me to... No! Not that! No! Not Belphegor, not Belphegor! You were right. He exists. Now I know. Right. Always shakes you up a little bit. Yeah but now... We have to help the kind Nebmess to the other side of the river. With the rising sun, Re triumphs over monsters of the night. What's with the blade? The addz. What you call a blade. It's part of the ritual, it's used to open the mouth. You begin anew the never-ending cycle. You are Nebmess laying down, you shall be Nebmess when you rise. Forever and eternity you shall remain alive. Five fifteen reporting. I'm off duty, it's all over. And so science fiction rushes in where true science fears to go? What have we just lived through here? What? I opened a door to the beyond. Crossed through a portal of some kind here, but I'm not sure we'll ever get back. Who cares if we don't? Have a good weekend Felix. Watch out for your ghost. Don't think about flying again. You realise you can't fly? I know, yeah. You're gonna miss it? That depends. Can you suggest something better? I think, I might, yeah.
