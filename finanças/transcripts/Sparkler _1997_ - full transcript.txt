Oh boy, I'd buy a new house. - What's wrong with your trailer? It's the nicest one in the park. - Yeah, I guess you're right. - You're drooling all over, girl. - He slobbered on me. (laughing) I tell you what, I would hire a maid or somebody to do the dishes. - I tell you what, no, wait. Tonight, I'll be your maid. - Ah! - Excuse me, but you seem to be out of soap, madam. - What, that's empty? Well, it's new, expensive kind, they don't give you a whole lot more. - That's okay, I'll just use some of this bar. - Oh no, that'll dry out your hands. - Oh, Melba, what do you care? I'm just the maid, I mean, I'm the maid. - No, I mean it, I'll go down to the Minimart and get some of that with the moisturizer in. - Hello. - Hello, Bob. How's everything going tonight? Oh, oh, look at that. Lighters, I'm gonna get one for Mom. (bed creaking and banging) Oh, great, the swamp cooler's acting up again. - Oh. - Hurry, before Melba gets home. - Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

There's only one kinda woman that's fit for a king, girl. - Shit, I ain't won a hand all night. - Not business, Rockefeller, it's yours. - That'd be mine. - Oh, God, fucking dammit! Give me a real chair, will you? - Well, that's it, Stew, you broke two already. - I did not break them, they were already broken. - You did, you fat fuck. (background country music) - I haven't heard from Melba. I guess that means she don't need me. Right now, I sure as hell don't need her either. - [Stew] Don't you miss her? - [Flint] What is this, the goddamn "Geraldo Show?"

Nothing I can't fix with a needle and thread. - The things you try and talk me into. - Now, I want you to do your nails. There's no time to do them right.

She's the sparkler. - Sparkler? - Sparklerorama. - Glowworm. - Glamorella. - Godzilla. - Glitterbug. - Cockroach. - Would one of you handsome young men care to dance with a lady? Well, I'm a little new at this. I, ah, haven't been out since, you know, 15 years of marriage. (light melodic music) - [Trent] I'll dance with you. - Well, thank you, darling. Huh! I'm Melba. - I'm Trent. Those are my friends, Brad and Joel. - You boys aren't from around here, are you? - No, we're from LA. - Oh, where you headed? - [Trent] Las Vegas. - Well, why'd you stop here? - We had a flat. - Oh, I thought so, people don't usually make a point of stopping here unless they have to. So you're going to Vegas? Yeah. I live on the way, I mean, you know, if you can't live some place nice, the next best thing is to live on the way. - You see the product of inbreeding? - Yes, I do. She's old enough to be his grandmother. - His what? - His mother. (both laughing) - I'm dancing with a boy from LA! What are you gonna do in Vegas, blow off some allowance money? (laughing) - [Trent] It's a little more urgent than that. - Oh? - We're $3,000 behind on our rent. - Oh, my. - And two of us don't have jobs. - Two of you? - And the CD club is sending me threatening letters. - Is that right? Oh. Well, thank you very much for the dance. - It was my pleasure. - Yeah, I certainly do appreciate you doing an old lady a favor. - Oh, you can't be that old. - Oh, aren't you sweet? I bet you don't have a lot of experience with women. - What's that supposed to mean? - Nothing, it just means next time you take a lady to dance, you should try leading a little more often. (laughing) - Okay, bye. - Back so soon? The way she was holding on to you, I figured she'd have you hitched up to her trailer by now. - Who's next? - I'm not getting up. - I don't dance. - That's okay, she'll lead. - [Melba] It's been done before. (laughing) (Brad laughing awkwardly) Come on. - [Brad] You're getting me the second AAA shows up. - You got it. - Watch out, she'll spin you. She's good. (Joel laughing) - You've actually met Mel Gibson, I mean, what is he like? Is he, is he nice? - He's just a person. - Well, if you don't mind me saying so, you seem a little young to be a Hollywood agent. - In a town like Hollywood, age is irrelevant. If you know what you want, you get it. - Well, I wish I'd known that when I was your age and what is it you want? - [Brad] Everything. - Ah, and when is this arriving, like tomorrow? (laughing) - When is not the question, it's who, who you know. - So if I was to come to Hollywood, knowing a person like you would be a good start? - It's a good a start as any, as a matter of fact. - Ooh, look, he's starting to make a move. (Joel laughing) - You have a car phone? - AAA awaits. - Well, it, it was nice meeting you. - Yeah, you too. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye, Melba. - Bye bye. - Girl, you gonna let those three get away? - Oh, stop it, they're just kids. - [Presenter] And here's the beauty of this, it comes with a recipe book for all of your favorite Oriental recipes, it's called "Asian Master Fry Cooker: Taste of the Orient." (Sherri sighing) - Wow, it's so easy to use. (door clicking) Here's a recipe for tempura. - Mom. - Oh! - Corn dogs! (door thudding) - Oh, my goodness! - I just had the most wonderful evening. (laughing) - Well, come on over here and sit down, tell me all about him. - Not him, them. I met three guys at the Backwoods Inn. - Three? - Yeah, they're from LA and they're on their way to Vegas. There were three of them. (laughing) - Oh-oh! - No, no, Mom, listen, I talked to one of them, he's a big Hollywood agent and he knows lots of people. - 39 years old and still as naive as the day you were born. - No, Mom, look, he even gave me his card. - How do you know they weren't just having fun at your expense? - Oh, Mom, you didn't see the way they were looking at me, they were looking at me like I was a star. You can ask anybody at that bar. - Well, I'm sure they were, you look beautiful, but how do you know they weren't just marking you out as some kind of target? - What are you talking about? - I'm talking scam, honey. - Mom, you watch too much TV. - Well then, why don't you explain to me why you are missing one of your earrings. - Oh, my tear drop, oh! - Yeah, 29.95 down the drain. - Oh, it must have fallen off while I was dancing, oh! - Fell off, my ass! Now you get on this phone and you call him and you tell him to bring it back here. - You don't know they took it. - Well, I guess there's one way to find out. I have never called a car phone before. (laughing) - Mom. - Hm? - Give me that. (mellow melodic music) (phone ringing) - Who's calling out here? - Well, I'll get it. Y'hello. Melba, hey, hi, how are you? - No fucking way, you gotta be kidding me. - That's great, how'd you get this number? Oh, he did? Oh, okay. - You gave her the telephone number? - I did not give her the telephone number. - She's calling. - We're on our way. - I gave her a card. - We're about an hour from state line. - What the hell does she want? - Giving her the card? - Oh, you did? - Hang up the phone. Just hang up the phone on her. - Oh, I'm sorry, when you were dancing? (Joel groaning) I'm sorry. Wait a minute, let me go check, let me see. - What are you doing? What are you doing? (mellow melodic music) - Yeah! - Whoa! - There it is. - This is a bad omen. - Wow! Why don't we just drop it off to you? - Bad, bad omen. - Look, are you fucking crazy? - No, no, no drop off, we'll mail it to her. Get her address, we'll mail it to her, no drop off. - Okay, Melba, actually, we're kind of on a tight schedule, so why don't we just get your address and when we get to Vegas, we'll mail it to you? - Exactly. - Oh, it is? Oh, hold on. She says it's very valuable, it's her mother's. - I don't give a shit. - So? - We're not turning back around. She's lucky we don't pawn it in Vegas. - Exactly. - What do you want me to tell her? - You tell her whatever you want, I don't care. - No, oh, I know, just meet us at our hotel in Vegas. - No! - No, no! Don't fuck this up. - Melba, as we haven't made- our accommodations yet. - Give me the phone! - Joel, take the phone! - Trent! - So why don't you give us a call in a little while? - No, no! - Hang up the phone. - All right, Melba, goodbye, bye bye. - Stupid ass! - [Trent] She still hasn't called. - Thanks. Good. Yeah, there's enough trailer trash in Vegas already. - How do you know she lives in a trailer? - Trust me, I know the type, pure white trash, 35 to 40, lives in a trailer, married to a trucker, eats chicken fried steak with gravy. Wears too much makeup, shops at Target, plays the lottery every week. Small life, big dreams going nowhere. - You know, you sound like a real agent there. - Yeah? - Yeah, still in the mail room. - Oh! - Two months, all right, give me two months and I'm on the fast track to success. - Okay, Mike Ovitz. (phone ringing) - This time, I'll handle it. Brad here. Melba, honey, how are you? - I am so glad y'all have that earring, yeah. Yeah, well, I wouldn't have, you know, if I'd lost it, I, I wouldn't have been able to forgive myself, I could have, I couldn't have forgiven myself. - What's he saying, what is he saying? What is he? What did she say? - She's not coming with us to Vegas, she's gonna meet us at the state line. (Joel and Trent laughing) And that's it. - I'm going to Vegas! - Oh, Melba, I just have a, kind of a real bad feeling about this. I think I'm gonna call my psychic friend. - Mom, why? This is exactly what Wanda said. And besides, you're right, I gotta do something and going somewhere's a damn good start. I'll go see Dottie Delgato. - Who? - Don't you remember? She was the head cheerleader at Victor Valley High. - I haven't thought of her in years. - She lives in Vegas and she's a showgirl. - When did that happen? - Right after high school, that girl snatched up her diploma, hopped in her Dodge Valley and was outta here. I got a letter from her a couple years ago saying she was one of the hottest acts on the Strip and once she wrote me and said she was even dating Siegfried & Roy, I mean, she must be doing pretty well. - Siegfried and Roy? - Well, you know, maybe she was, you know, in love with them or something, I don't remember, but she's doing really well and she's always asking me to come visit. - Well, I, I don't want to see you get all worked up and then get disappointed, honey. - Mom, what is the worst thing that could happen? I go to Las Vegas and make friends with a big Hollywood agent, who helps me start a new life in Los Angeles. (laughing) - Well, just get the earring back and be careful. (dog barking) And have a good time. (sobbing) - Mom. (melodic upbeat music) - Okay, here's the deal, we all play together and any money we win, we put in the envelope. Does that work for everyone? - Yeah and as soon as Miss Victorville shows up, we are out of here. - Hey, no shit. ♪ Please understand I'm a mixed bag ♪ ♪ Misguided thing ♪ ♪ No not knowing how the truth ♪ (bell ringing) (background people chattering) (customer shrieking) - Which one should I do? - Well, go red. - It's on red. - Yeah, I hate this system, it kills me. - Why are some chips like red? - Relax, just think red.

My mom plays slots. Let's do baccarat or something. - You should've gone odd as well, I told you odd. (background people chattering) (bells dinging) - Okay, Melba, the future is now.

(slot machine arm clanking) - What are you talking about? - Did you? - No, of course not. - Well, that explains it. (slot machine arm clanking) - Explains what? - Something she told me, don't worry about it. - What'd she tell you? (slot machine arm clanking) - Let's just say that Sarah is used to getting what she wants. - What does that mean, huh? - Nothing. (slot machine arm clanking) (slot machine dinging) Jackpot! Yes, money. - Just set it aside.

Do you know when she'll be back? - Oh no, but I can hold the check for her. - No, no, no, no, you can't hold the check, it's not cashable anyway and that is not how it works. We have to present the check to the winner in person, get the whole happy event on video, after which she will sign a release form for promotional purposes and do you have any idea when she'll be back? - I'm not really sure.

It breaks down the molecular structure of your hair, so it can take the shape of the perm. - Changes the structure, wh-what if it falls out? - Well, that's not going to happen unless you yank all the curlers out.

She's a part of me. - I hope that's not the part you gave Hurricane. - Oh, that's all over with. I can't tell you how much I love her. (sobbing) I can't tell you how much I need her back. - Well, if that really is the case, then that really is too bad for you. - Please, Mama, please, please, (sobbing) just ask her to come back home. - I'd be more than happy to, but she left town last night. - She did what? - She left town last night, so I can't help you. You doing all right? - Hm. - Your hair falling out yet? - Hm-hm. - W-w-w-where did she go, when's she coming back? - I can't rightly say. - Don't give me that crap! She must have told you where she was going. - I don't remember, poor girl was so upset over what you did to her, she could've gone anywhere, not that I blame her. - Look, you know where she is, you better tell me. - Or what, what are you gonna do, Flint? - I'll... (cheerful country music) I'll, (customer screaming) I'll rip her hair out! - Flint, would you let go of her? - Tell me where she is, where'd she go? (customer shrieking) - Flint, stop! You're scaring us! - I don't give a rat's ass. Where is she? - I don't know, now she-she said something about visiting some old high school friend, but I don't know where! - Well, high school friend, who was it? - Flint, turn her head loose!

(upbeat swing music) (upbeat swing music continues) - [Melba] Um, excuse me, ladies, I hate to bother you, but I, I was wondering if you could maybe help me find a friend of mine. - What's her name? - [Melba] Dottie Delgato. - Hm. - Well, actually, she was a friend of mine in high school. (showgirls laughing) - I'm sorry, honey, but you know what? I don't think you're gonna find her around here. - Hm-hm. - I beg your pardon? - [Showgirl] No, see, there's no way in hell you can stay a showgirl on the Strip for over what, 10 years. (laughing) - Well, ah, she was a really good dancer. - Look, honey, I don't care if she was fucking Baryshnikov, okay, as soon as your tits start sagging, you're outta here. (showgirls laughing) - Okay? Do you know where maybe I could find her? - You know what? Old Jesse might be able to help you out. Jesse? - Oh yeah. - Hey, Jesse. - Yep. - Jesse, he's been managing this place for, how long, Jesse? - Since Bugsy Siegel. (showgirls laughing) - I bet since before I was born. - Thank you. Um, these ladies said maybe you could help me find a friend of mine, she used to work here. - Maybe, maybe not, what's her name? - [Melba] Dottie Delgato. - Delgato, Dottie Delgato, that name sounds familiar. - [Melba] Well, she would've been here in the late eighties. - Hm, what'd she do? - Oh, I, she was a dancer. - What was her specialty, what did she do? - Oh, I haven't seen her since high school. She was head cheerleader, she twirled a pretty good baton. - Baton, huh? Oh wait, you must mean Lady Luck. I remember her, Lady Luck loves to fu, oh, yeah, I remember her, (chuckling) she'd get more guys horny with the things she'd do with that baton. - Do you know where I could find her? Excuse me, I hate to bother you, I thought maybe you could help me find a friend of mine, her name is Dottie Delgato. - Dottie Del Taco? - Delgato. - Dottie? Oh, they all seem to be named Dottie, Dottie, Tammy, Crystal, Vanna, oh, that's a big one now. Did she have a stage name? - Um, at the Tropicana I believe they called her Lady Luck. - That's original. Did she, did she play with feathers? - Not to my knowledge, no. - She use appliances? - No, but I do think she did things with a baton. - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, Lady Luck, loves to fuck, yeah. No, she's been, I haven't seen her around. Wait, wait, yeah, some of the boys said they saw her at the Crack. - The Crack, where, where could I find that? - Oh, honey, you don't wanna go there. (muffled melodic heavy music) - [Customer] Oh yeah, yeah! (whistling) (background people chattering) (melodic heavy music) Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, take it! - Oh, this can't be right. - [Ed] Can I help you? - Um, I-I was looking for a friend of mine, but I think I'm in the wrong place. (melodic heavy music) - Oh, yeah! I got more money, I got more money! - Hey, we're all looking for someone, who isn't? - Take it! - Lady Luck. - You mean Dottie, what are you looking for her for? - I'm a friend of hers from high school. - Look, I'm very protective about my girls. What do you want with her? - I'm in town for a visit. - Okay, to take her from here? - No, no, I just hadn't seen her in a really long time. - I guess that's all right. She's up next, why don't you have a seat? - Thank you. Do I have to pay a cover? - You got a dick? Hey, buy this girl a drink! - Thank you. - Okay, let's hear it for the Crack's own Dream Barbie and her high school Honey Fox. (laughing) And now the Crack is proud to present Lady Luck.

I was just trying to be nice. I mean, she came over, she's like, "Do you guys wanna dance with me?" - All right. - She looked at you guys, she looked at me. - All right! - You weren't gonna say anything, so I danced with her. How is that my fault? - All right, all right, all right, it's not your fault. - I'm just saying, how's it my fault? - It's his fault, Mr. Bigshot Hollywood Agent. What exactly did you tell her, Brad, huh, you're gonna make her a big star? - You told, (laughing) you told her that? - How was I supposed to know she'd try to call me? - You took her earring. - You think I did that on purpose? - I've seen you go to further lengths to get to bed with a girl before. - Give me a break, I've got standards. - [Joel] Yeah, she's gotta have a pulse. - He's got you there, buddy. - You got a problem with that? - No. - Who was the last girl you slept with? - Oh. - Better yet, who was the first? - Come on. - I've slept with girls. - What girls? - Rachel. - Rachel who? - This chick, Rachel. - When did you meet her? - I met her at the supermarket. - What's her, what's her last name? - I don't know. - What's her telephone number? - I met her at a produce section, what does it matter? - The produce section? - I sleep with chicks. - She has nothing do with anything. - The point here is that we have been hacked by some bum fuck chick who you had to fucking dance with and who you promised to make a star. - It was your fault that we were in that bar to begin with! - My fault, it's my fault! - 'Cause you cried refill! - I wouldn't need a fucking refill, if your fucking tire hadn't blown out! - Maybe I could've fixed the tire, if some asshole hadn't have left it in LA! - Oh, I wouldn't have fucking left it in LA, if you- - That's my pants! (all shouting) That's my shit! - Fuck you! - Fuck you! - This is my shit! - [Joel] Asshole. - I've been with a chick! (muffled rock music) (muffled audience cheering) - Dottie, you back here? Oh, yeah. - Jesus Christ, Ed, wait 'til I get a head on. How many times do I have to tell you that? - Are we taking visitors today? - Well, not unless they have a million bucks or a cheeseburger. (Ed laughing) - Dottie Delgato, you can't stop cheering, can you? - Melba May. Lord, what are you doing here? - Well, after all these years, I decided to come to Vegas and track you down. - I bet you did. You find out about me and Flint? - Flint, what's Flint got to do with it? - You know, seeing you reminds me of being caught in the girls' room smoking a joint. (lighter clicking) - Ah, you want me to stick around? - What for, I can handle myself, can't I? Melba, Ed, Ed, Melba. Now get out. - All right. Well, see you upstairs. - Yeah. - Yeah. - So um, like what's upstairs, another club or? - It's our apartment. - Oh, you two live together? - Yeah, you know, it's a dump, but she pays the rent. - She? - Melba, it's the nineties, wake up. - [Melba] Is she, is he, is it like a- - Melba, she's a woman, Ed is short for Edith. - Does she like looking like a man? - She does everything like a man, you know what I'm saying? So what brings you here? Don't bullshit me, 'cause it must've taken an awful lot of effort to find me, because it took a lot of effort for me to get here. - Well, Dottie, what did you mean about Flint? - Are you two still together? - No. - Well, good, then this won't hurt as much. You see, I've just been waiting for the day, that you were gonna show up on my doorstep, 'cause I figured sooner or later you'd find out, that Flint and I were seeing each other, if you can call it that. - You and Flint are having an affair? - Please, nothing so dramatic. No, you know, once or twice a year, he'd blow into town. - And? (muffled rock music) - Well, let's just say he wasn't the only one getting blown. - Well, it really doesn't surprise me. I've known all along that Flint was scum. - Yeah, you got that right. (muffled audience cheering) - Well, why'd you keep seeing him? - Why the hell not? You know, it's always nice to have a man once in a while, I mean, I'm no spring chicken, Besides, it was kind of fun to see Ed get pissed off. - [Melba] Why would Ed get pissed off? - (laughing) Because whenever Flint would show up, she knew I was off limits. Let me tell you, she gets mighty pissy, when she ain't getting any. (muffled rock music) - What, like you and Ed, you mean you and she? - What can I say? I'm a dyke's bitch. But you know, it's free rent. - And what, Ed would just let you go off with Flint? - Look, if you're not here about Flint, why are you here? - Well, actually I left everything and I'm trying to meet up with some friends of mine and I need a place to stay. - Who are the friends? - [Melba] Three boys from LA. - Well, shit, girl, if I had three boys, I'd dump Flint too. - [Melba] No, now, they're just friends, it's nothing like that. - Listen, they're all just friends until you do them and then they're nothing. Well, my next set isn't for another hour, so wanna go upstairs and drop off your stuff? - Yeah. (Dottie laughing) - [Dottie] Like I said, it's a dump, but it's free. Hi Ed, how are you doing? - Hey. So is your friend staying for dinner? - [Melba] Oh no, thank you, I've gotta find my friends. - Oh, where are they staying? - At the Plaza. - Well, you know, I'll tell you what, why don't you stay for dinner and then I'll go do my next set and then you and I will go and find them together? You know, girls' night out, just you, me and your three little boys. - So are we three having dinner? - Yeah, thank you. - Dottie. - Huh? - Set a place, please. - Ed's cooking, she must really like you. - Are you sure I can't help you? - Everything's under control. Mm, hope you like chili though. - Oh, leave her alone, Melba. She loves making her chili, actually it's really good. - I'm very proud of it. - Well, shit, girl, you should be, you're the Nevada Chili Cookoff champion three years in a row. - Well, at least let me make dessert. - Go for it, but I don't think we really have anything though. - Well, I mean, okay, I'll find something. (Ed sighing) This is my famous rice, rice diddley. - Wow, it looks like a bunny bottom pie. - (laughing) These are the cheeks. - That be the butt box. (all laughing) - Well, alright, now wait, we're not done, this is what we do now. Now we are going to saturate them in this very fabulous liqueur and we are going to on the count of three, set them ablaze. - Will that burn them up? - No, no, it's called flambe, the alcohol will burn off leaving only the delicate taste of liqueur to saturate your bunny bottom pie. (Ed laughing) - Oh, fun! - Okay, on the count of three, are we all ready? One, two, three, light them up. - Whoa! (fire whooshing) - Whoa! - Sweet Jesus! Oh, I think I singed my eyebrows, oh, Ed! - Oh, I love my little sugar shag. - Oh, shit. - It's okay, it's okay. (Ed laughing) - Ah! - I haven't had this much fun since Girl Scouts. (background people chattering) - [Trent] Yes, we are, hit me, baby. - You know, Brad was way outta line with you earlier. - When? - Back in the room. - Oh, he was just talking shit. - No, it's none of his business who you sleep with. - He don't mean anything by it. (craps dice thudding) - Trent. - Yeah? - Why didn't you sleep with Sarah? - I don't sleep with friends' old girlfriends, that's not cool, you were engaged to her. - Come on, you're not telling me the whole story. - What story? - How could you resist? - There's nothing to resist. - Why, what's the matter? - Nothing's the matter. - Oh, you don't like girls? - What? - Look, man, you can tell me, all right, it's okay. - Tell you what? - Do you ever have like feelings? - Feelings? - You know, like feelings for a guy? - No. - It's a perfectly natural thing. - What is up with you, are you saying I suck cock? - No. - Then what are you saying? - I'm not saying that, I'm saying that- - What? - It's not a bad thing. - What's not a bad thing? - To have feelings for a guy. - Are you saying because I didn't sleep with Sarah, I'm a fucking homo? - No. - Then what are you saying? - I'm saying that if you were, it wouldn't matter. - Well, what about you, why did you break up with her, if you think she's so irresistible? - She broke up with me. - Why, because you're a fag? - Exactly. - Fuck you. - Yes, yes! - Yes! - Dude, Trent, dude, I just made 1,000 bucks! - [Trent] That's great. - Did you hear what I said? I just picked up a grand, half of it on the last round! - It's really great. Where's Joel? - I, I don't know. Hey, how'd you guys do? (chips clattering) Holy shit! (chips clattering) (faucet water running) (door clicking) (soft melodic music) - Hey. Listen, Joel, what do you do with your life is your own business, you know. - Please spare me, all right. - Joel, I just want you to know that I'm trying. - You're trying? You're trying what? - Joel, you're still the same person to me. Joel. Shit. (Trent sighing) (mellow country music) - I've been here before. - Oh, really? - Oh, look, to be 20 again. - Yeah, I know what you mean. - Oh, (laughing) I guess we still have something. - I'm gonna see what room they're in, okay. - All right. (gentle melodic music) (gentle melodic music continues) - [Trent] So how long have you known? (gentle melodic music) - I always have. - [Trent] Even when you were a little kid? - Ever since I had a mind to think about it. - You must think me and Brad are total dicks then. - No, I don't. - [Trent] Then why didn't you tell us? Why did you keep pretending the whole time? - Why? - [Trent] We're your friends. - And you and Brad are just gonna understand? - [Trent] Everybody has something like that. - Everybody has something like what? - Something they wanna hide and not tell. (gentle melodic music) (Trent sighing) (sighing) Okay. I just wanna to let you know that I'm here, if you wanna talk or anything. - Well, now you know. (gentle melodic music) (background people chattering) - I called their room, but they weren't there. - Didn't you leave a message? - Well, no, I wanted to surprise them. - Well, I thought they knew you were coming. - Well, they did, but they don't. Dottie, what are you staring at? - Oh, just a fine piece of manhood. - I can't believe it, it's Brad. (laughing) - You know him? - Yeah, that's my friend. Brad, Brad! (laughing) - Melba, what are you doing here? - I'm visiting my friend, Dottie Delgato. Dottie, this is Brad. - Very nice to meet you, Brad. - Nice to meet you. - [Melba] So where are Trent and Joel? - Um, I don't know where they are. - Well, let's go find them. - I don't even know if they stayed in the casino. - Well, they're bound to come back to the room at some point, right? - Eventually. - Okay, let's go leave them a message. - I-I really don't even know when they're getting back. - Well, this is really important, I need to see all three of you. This time, I have something to give you. Well, Trent, really, so come on, let's go. (laughing) - Shit. (mellow melodic music) (door clicking) Trent, Joel. Well, they're not here. Look, why don't you give me the number where you're staying and we'll hook up with you later? - Could I just use your restroom, you know, just to freshen up, you don't mind, do you? - She's a showgirl. - I really don't know when they're coming back. - Well, you don't mind if I wait, do you? Because, you know, I wouldn't ask, if it wasn't really important. Ooh, bouncy! - I've been up all night, actually I just wanna get some sleep. - Oh, you just go right ahead, I just, I won't bother you a bit. (door clicking) Talk about all the luck, look who's here. - Melba, what are you doing here? (door thudding) - I think I'm gonna be sick. (door clicking) - I'll be right out! - Who's in the bathroom? - That's my friend, Dottie, you'll meet her later, but guys, come over here, I have something to give you. - No more earrings, please. - Actually this is for Trent, but it'll probably help out all of you. - What's this? - [Melba] It's yours. (door clicking) - All right, let's party! Hi. - That's Melba's friend, Dottie. She's a showgirl. - [Joel] Of course she is. - I don't understand, what do you mean this is mine? - With the money you loaned me at Buffalo Bills, I kept playing, waiting for you to come back from the bathroom and I kept playing and I kept winning and finally morning come and I had all these chips in front of me and I just thought it was only fair, that you should have your share, since it was your money that started me off. - Melba, I can't take this. - I can. (laughing) - No, you won it, you take it for yourself. - Oh, I kept some for myself, this is just your half. - Huh? - I don't believe it. - Well, that's what I'd do for any of my friends. - Well guys, you know what this means? We've got our rent money and then some. - Yeah, we do. - What, you've got 3,000 already? - Well, with this we have 3,700. - Oh, I can't believe, okay, you know what this means? Now we have to go celebrate. - Yeah, let's go out and celebrate. - Sure, why not, how much damage can we do in one night? - Well. (laughing) - That place has all, all the like ribs and stuff. Hey Joel, don't you think it would be a good idea to go out and celebrate? - Come on. - Yeah, it's always a good idea to celebrate. - Yeah. - All right, it's settled then, Miss Delgato here knows all the hotspots, don't you, Dottie? - Oh yes, I do. Let's go paint that town red. - All right, Melba, let's go. (melodic upbeat music) (audience applauding) - Don't fuck with the clown! - Okay, let's hear it for Bazooka!

He talks in big, definite statements, the only way he can feel bigger is to talk bigger. He's just trying to figure out who he is. - Brad is in his own world and he talks a lot of bullshit. - You should be more patient with them. You're more mature than they are and, and even though you're the same age, they're younger. - You don't think Trent knows who he is either? - Oh, isn't Trent just the cutest little thing like Bambi looking through those big, doe eyes? He thinks the whole world's wonderful, 'cause he doesn't have the experience to know any better. I bet he's never been with a woman. Now, not that that's a good thing or a bad thing, but it can certainly affect the way you view the world. You know what I see about you? Well, you remind me of me or at least how I used to be. - I do? - Listen, before I came to Vegas, I was very unhappy, so I did everything I could to make myself happy with things instead of dealing with what was making me unhappy to begin with. So I collected a lot of things, you, you drink. I used to walk around putting on airs, pretending I was somebody I wasn't, but you walk around in a big cloud of doom to cover who you are. - So, who do you think I am? - I don't really know, but I know what you're not, you're not alone, you are surrounded by friends, who probably care a whole lot more about you than you think. I'd like to consider myself your friend someday. - Ah, this kid is some dancer, any more of his sexy moves and I won't be responsible for my actions. (Melba laughing) You wanna go back to the hotel? - Oh, wait a minute. I don't think I've had the pleasure of dancing with you yet. - Oh, my friend, I'd be honored. Oh, wait a minute, when I first danced with Brad and Trent, I was wearing these. I don't see why you deserve any less. - [Joel] The sparkler. - Sparkler? - Yeah, that's what we called you when we first met you. - That's right, we did, among other things. - Let's dance. - You called her the sparkler, what's that? - Oh, that's just a nickname we gave her. - I want a nickname too. - Yeah. - Ah-huh. She's the sparkler, what am I? (Trent and Brad laughing) What? - I don't know, I can think of a few. - Yeah, what? - How about Sparklepuss? - Oh, you haven't even seen it yet. - No, no, I didn't mean that, I meant, ah, I'm gonna get some water. (melodic upbeat music) - Anybody up for some more gambling? - Blackjack? - Yes. - [Dottie] Oh, let's find a lucky table. - Well, I'm up for some craps myself. - Oh yeah, I just love to blow the dice, excuse me. - Here is $200 for each of you and we still got the rent covered for next month. - Thanks, Pappy. - You're welcome. So wanna roll the dice when it's our turn? - Oh, I'd love to, handsome, but I'm just gonna go freshen up until the dice get here. ♪ Coming from a man is a sweet thing ♪ - [Dottie] (sighing) All right. ♪ Sweet thing here ♪ ♪ Sweeter than you do ♪ ♪ She's an ocean and I'm falling for her ♪ - That blush looks very nice in this light. - Oh, I've always liked it. - And that lipstick goes perfectly. - Oh, haven't had any complaints. - Who makes it? - It's from a collection called Sexy Face. (laughing) - Wow! - This is Sex Pout number three. - Hm. - And this is Sex Flush, no number, brings the men in like bees to honey. - I'll have to remember that. - Hello, darling. - Flint. - I've been waiting all night to see you. - Sexy Face. - (sighing) Flint, she doesn't wanna see you. - Yeah, she does, I know she loves me. - I think you'd better think again. - Oh, come on, Dottie, Melba's loved me ever since Victor Valley High. - You know, in case you haven't noticed, a lot has changed since high school. - Ah-huh. - Well, maybe except you. - Oh, you're absolutely right, Dottie, I haven't changed, I still love Melba just as much as I did back then. Hell, who knows? Maybe even more. Don't I at least deserve a chance to talk to her? - Well, maybe so, but I don't see what I can do. - Well, you're her friend, you can tell her that Vegas is no place for a lady. I mean, it's fine for the likes of you. - What is that supposed to mean? - Well, I'm just saying you're tough, you were made for the fast lane. Hell, Melba doesn't even belong on the highway, she's too simple for a life like yours. - I would hardly call Melba simple. - I'm not saying simple, stupid, I'm saying simple, naive. She needs someone to take care of her. - Like you? - Yeah, like me. I'm not perfect and I know I got problems, but I love Melba and I would take care of her. Things will really be different this time. - And how's that? - I got a guaranteed ace in the hole, but you gotta promise not to tell Melba. - (sighing) Flint, I don't have time for your games. - Believe me, Dottie, this ain't no game. - Oh, shit, I get this stuff all the time. (background piano music) What's this? Is this a joke? Oh, she won? (both laughing) Well, Flint, I gotta hand it to you, I mean, it's no surprise that becoming a millionaire's made a changed man out of you. - Well, (laughing) it doesn't hurt, but you gotta believe me when I tell you, I really do love Melba. - Well, what do you want? - If you could just get Melba to talk to me in private for a few minutes, I would really appreciate it. - Privacy in Vegas, you have got to be kidding. - I brought our trailer, it's parked right outside the hotel. All you gotta do is get her to meet me in the trailer, so we can talk in private for a few minutes. - Well, I mean, I'll see what I can do, but not promising anything. (laughing) - [Flint] Great, here's the key. - All right, I'll tell her, um, but you'll have to give me some time. - How much? - An hour, an hour and a half at the most. - Okay, I'll be waiting. (both laughing) Thanks, Dottie. - Ah-huh. - I owe you one. - Well, maybe just a few bucks. (melodic country music) Excuse me. - What took you so long? You missed our turn. - Oh, don't worry, it'll come back around, it always does. My turn. (Dottie blowing) (Dottie laughing) (dice thudding) Oh! (laughing) - You sure got a way of blowing the dice. - Oh, I've got a way of blowing other things too. Look, why don't you just roll the dice and then we'll blow this joint? - Yeah. (dice thudding) - [Dealer] Crap dice. (melodic country music) - Do you ever double down? (Melba giggling) - You guys, I'm ready to turn in. - Well, okay, thank you, let's finish up here and find Brad and Dottie and just go. - Ah, I don't think that's such a good idea actually. - [Melba] Why not? - I just saw Brad and Dottie and it looked like they were having an intimate moment. - Brad and Dottie? Holy shit, what? - What are you talking about? You must be mistaken. (door clicking) - [Dottie] Oh, Jesus Christ! (door thudding) - What the hell is this? - [Dottie] Oh, it's Melba's. - [Brad] I knew it, I knew she lived in a trailer. She drove here in this? - No, her husband did. - Her husband? - Ah-huh. You know, I, I didn't really come here to talk. (bed creaking) Oh! - Well, hello, Melba, all right, it's Miller time. (truck engine starting) (trailer clattering) - Jesus, oh! Flint! (trailer clattering) Oh, God! Flint, it's me, Dottie, stop! (trailer clattering) - Oh, my God! - [Dottie] Shit, oh, my God, I'm sorry. - Oh, what the hell? Dottie, Jesus Christ! (door clicking) - So I sort of saw her dragging him this way. (truck door thudding) - Melba! (soft melodic music) - Flint, what are you doing here? - Are you all right? - Yeah, I'm fine as long as you just stay right where you are. - Oh, come on, baby, you're not still mad at me, are you? - No, I'm not mad. - Well, good, let's go home. - Now what makes you think I'd go back? - Well, that thought crossed my mind, so I brought home to you. - That's her home? - Brad was right. - Shit, I-I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - You know what? - I'm sorry. - You know what, I thought young boys could do it anytime. It's okay, you can do it. - Well- I'm sorry, I, I can't. - Please, can't you just close your eyes? Come on, is it the hair? Here, look, there, it's better. Thanks. - Come on, Melba, please don't be this way. I promise I'll be good. - Flint, leave me alone, you are wasting my time. - Melba, please don't make me lose my patience. - Let go of me! - She said she doesn't wanna go home with you, now just relax. - Oh, man, wow! (laughing) You're picking them young these days, aren't you, Melba? - Let go of me. - I said leave her alone. - Fuck! - I said I can't do it! - [Dottie] Brad, get over here. - [Brad] What-what's going on? - It's Melba's husband, he came to take her home. - [Joel] What the fuck were you doing in here, man? (door thudding) - I don't know, forget it. - Hi, - Hi. - Well, she's here. - You were supposed to get her inside the trailer. - Somebody tell me what's going on? - Melba, I drove all this way because I love you. - Don't fall for him- - Shut up, shut up! And I need you and I know you love me too. - Melba, it's bullshit. - We can work this out. - Listen, he just- - Shut up! - Get your fucking hands off her! - Let go! - Don't! - [Melba] Listen, let go of her and we'll talk. - In private? - Yes. - Ow! - Melba, it's a trap. He was gonna try and kidnap you. You won the sweepstakes, Melba, I saw the letter, the envelope, everything. - What? - (laughing) Ow! - No! (all shouting) (bottle shattering) - Shut up, everybody shut up! - Oh, God! - Shut up! Now Melba, I'm telling you for the last time. Melba May. - Oh, God! - You get in that trailer or I will cut her head off! - Oh, God! - Let her go. - Let her go. - Put the bottle down. - [Flint] So what's it gonna be, huh? - He's not gonna do anything with everybody watching. - Shut up! - Chill, man. - I'm telling you, I will cut her piece of shit head off, I swear I will! (gun clicking) - After I shoot off yours, now drop the bottle. - Oh, God. - Oh, Ed! (bottle shattering) - Don't move! Dottie, go! - Oh, God. Wait. (hand slapping) Pig! (traffic rumbling quietly) Here. I'm sorry, I, I shouldn't have fallen for his shit. - Yeah, you and me both. - I think one of you should be calling the police. - Yeah. - Oh, please, please don't call the police. - Look, Flint, either we call the police or I blow your freaking head off. - All right, call the police, call the damn police! - Don't move! - I would like to have a word with my husband. - Ed, you keep that gun on him. - Melba, you know you're the only one I ever loved. Can't we just forget about all this? - Flint. (blow thudding) - Uh! (melodic rock music) - Yeah. Okay. (Flint coughing) - Fucking stay there. - Are you sure you wanna move to LA? I mean, you know you can always stay with us. - Thank you, but I gotta go. - How are you gonna survive? I mean, you don't know anybody out there and believe me, it ain't easy being a single girl on your own. - Well, I know it's not, but this is something I've got to do. - Well, I guess with a few million, it'll make life a little easier. (laughing) And besides, if you ever feel spending any of that money, you know where to find us. No, you know what I mean? (Melba laughing) If you, you know where to find us, if you are ever feeling lonely. - Yeah. - Well, we'll take care of her. - Aw, now come on, girls, you didn't think I was gonna forget about you two, did you? - [Melba And Dottie] Ah! (laughing) - Oh, thank you, Dottie and you, Ed. - You have a good trip, come back. - Yeah, I will, I'll send this right on when I collect. Thank you, okay, keep dancing. - All right, Melba. - Thank you very much, appreciate it. - Bye. Bye. - Bye, sweetie. - Bye. - Bye bye. (background people chattering) - See you. - Bye, Brad.
