This evening I experienced the self as a (naturally) unreliable machine for setting the world in motion: as if the self must first set itself in motion (like a powerplant) to illuminate the world, enlighten it. Peter Handke: In the woods, might be late A film by Corinna Belz Unfortunately l am no longer as bold as l would like to be l am, actually... This terrible shyness that l had, and yet l was still bold. Everytime l go to mass l think, I pray that I will lose this shyness. ls it still there? -Yes, with people. Somehow that makes me lose my poise. -The others? When I have a role to play... l don't know what my role is, l insist on my role. I insist that I am the one who does that. But l don't know how you make that happen, l don't know. l'm widely known for being crazy for mushrooms. But it's one of the most beautiful things in life When I'm sitting in an airplane and I am bored stiff, in airplanes, at airports, l think: When l get home, everything will be better, when l'm there in that mundane little world. That's liberating. In this shitty, calculated technical world. Okay then, l'll do this now Don't want to provoke a major discussion A little dirt is good, l like to eat a little with the mushroom That's the problem, what to do with it... cut it open? No idea. -Yes, but that's quite heartless. Okay, there are no worms in it, for sure. Of course, you can always be wrong. But isn't that beautiful? People always say they smell like nuts, but... What a beautiful sound that is! lsn't that beautiful? Still, everything is transitory. Haven't you seen my path, my perpetual path, over there? When I'm doing nothing, I walk back and forth. That's the beaten path of thought? Yes, priests have breviary paths When they are praying the breviary. And l have... I just walk up and down. On that successful day... - Attempt at a chronicle of the same - ...beads of dew lay on a raven's feather. As usual, an old woman, albeit a different one than yesterday, stood in the newspaper store, her shopping long since done, and spoke up. The ladder in the garden, embodiment of getting out of oneself, had seven rungs. The sand in the trucks moving through the suburbs was the same color as the façade of Saint-Germain-des-Prés. The chin of a young girl in the library touched her neck. A tin bucket took its shape. A mailbox turned yellow. The marketwoman wrote the bill in the palm of her hand. On that successful day, it happens that a cigarette butt rolls in the gutter, just as a cup steams on a tree stump and in the dark church, a row of chairs is bright from the sun. It happens that... the few men in the cafe, even the loudmouth, are silent with each other for a long moment, and that even the out-of-towner joins them in silence. It happens that my sharpened hearing for my work also opens me up to the sounds in the house. On that successful day, a habit will be discontinued, an opinion vanish, and I shall be surprised, by him, by you, by myself. In the house I shall discover a corner that has hitherto been overlooked, where "someone could live!" And at the end of the day it would have called out for a book- something more than a mere chronicle: "The fairytale of the successful day." And at the very end, the glorious oblivion would have come that the day was supposed to be successful. Have you ever experienced a successful day? -You wrote that here, didn't you? Up in the small room At the very top, in what became the nursery. It was beautiful, it was November, December. l still remember perfectly. Up in the smallest room where you look out or onto or down on the avenue of thujas. The housewarming - celebrated with a kind of thoughtful work, and not with some party. That was the first time, in this house here, and l had an especially good eye for details, you come to live somewhere and for a time... Maybe there's a borderaround everything, not the border around an announcement of mourning, but not a joyful border either. There is an inscription around everything. Every thing has a kind of fragmentary script drawn around it. The rhythm opens the inner eye. lt's a rhythm that arises out of longing... or out of wanting to see with, or ascend with the thing. And out of this rhythm the images come, that may not only be from here, but that may have arrived... 50 years earlier, that l now see here, the images. What more was there to do, to discover, to recognize in a day? Behold: No king of eternity, no king of life, and if so only a "secret" one - No, here stands the king of the day! The only odd part of it was that at this point a trifle sufficed to topple him ...from his imperious throne. At the sight of the passerby who came sauntering out of the side street, with his coat over his arm, stopped, patted his pockets, and quickly turned back, his pacing turned to exasperation. Chronicle of Current Events Director: Peter Handke, 1971 "Disturbed, you begin to raise the question everywhere, how one might live." "How should one live? How to live with one another? How to be essential for each other and for one's self?" "How should one live?" Sophie, hello! ...yes. Mhm. Yes, they're filming right now... Yes, but l can see you tonight, maybe at Montparnasse, Sophie. Have a good day. See you in a bit. What are you laughing about? -l'm laughing about the cats. Never in my life have l sat in front of a computer. lt's not a matter of principle. l am not as technically incapable as one might think. But there is no erotic attraction to me. Back then... Okay, electric typewriters are long gone as well, aren't they? l tried those back then, but... the faint sound, the drone of expectation, that put me off. But mechanical typewriters, l liked them when l was young. That tack-tack-tack sound! -Mr. Handke, you have been in the writing business for only three years. (The profile: Peter Handke In conversation with Friedrich Luft, 1969) -You have, in this time, if l count correctly, written three or four books of prose, you have written radio plays, you have written half a dozen plays, you produce a lot. Do you produce quickly? How do you do it? lt only seems that these were produced very quickly. When l, let's say, really began to write, when I didn't just write emotionally, -Yes. out of some feeling or impulse, -Yes. but when l began to work methodically, when I noticed that every sentence you write is somehow imposed on you, then it becomes insanely difficult for me. Almost every day the moment comes, when l... just sitting at the table or somewhere else, the moment when l get tangled up. When l just can't... and it's not dangerous, but... it can be almost bestial. -And then you become enraged? Enraged, well... Enraged isn't the right word. lt is, as if you... l don't know, when you want to open a door that won't open, and you rattle and rattle and even destroy the handle and... and somehow destroy... you beat your head on the door, or... it's kind of a stupid parable, but all comparisons are false. -Typically you might say: "kick" the door down. But this one can't be kicked down! They are doors that won't open... with force. Also not with cunning, and not with technique. Technique won't work for sure. Technique is the way not to do something, right? To avoid something, while writing. That sand in there, trickling out of the shell. lt was in the shell for2 million years, the sand. l always think it is salty, it really ought to be, since it comes from the ocean, but it's not salty. That's quite something. It's... it's him. I don't need to check for scars. He's become older but he's still the one he always was. As soon as it begins to rain, he brings the chair out of the house, sits down under the eaves, and watches the rain with arms crossed. During the storm he runs into the woods ...and squats down in the root troughs ...under a spruce and listens to the soughing tree tops. He is the one who shirks work and who works like the dickens. He moans and groans and plays the stoic. He mutely feels for you and laughs at you with tinny derision. He is his parents' joy and sorrow. He is the one who fails to ask the question and who then scurries to recoup. He is our neighbor ...and our man overseas. -Mr. Handke, you were much talked about, made it into the newspapers, when you took the stage at the meeting of the "Gruppe 47" and declared that you disagreed with the literary practices prevailing there. -Was it... Had you planned to, as it were, provoke the establishment ...or did it really happen spontaneously? Of course l hadn't planned it. lt happened spontaneously. Later I was astonished, how that was even possible. Because, l hadn't ever experienced myself in such a situation. So, Peter Handke... Peter Handke. Oh well. Peter Handke: l see a kind of descriptive impotence as the rule in contemporary German prose. Salvation is sought in unembellished description. That is, naturally, the cheapest thing literature can be made of. The isn't any kind of reflection. What makes this prose bad... is that it could just as well be copied from an encyclopedia. That is the system being used here. And the claim is that literature is being made. It is a completely inane and idiotic literature. And literary critics are in agreement because their inherited apparatus can deal with this kind of literature, just barely... Because criticism is exactly as inane as this inane literature! -l'm out of time, Mr. Handke. Now we know exactly what you mean. l always wanted to assert myself. Already as a young man? -Yes, always When I was with someone, there was no escape for them. Oh well... It's also a beautiful way not to escape. So, I have experienced this and that, both in life and while reading. I haven't deviated from that. Do you understand? I haven't deviated from what I experienced while reading... and while dreaming and being. And l never let myself be played for a fool. Not by anyone. l understood: That can't happen. Otherwise l wouldn't have uttered my nonsense at the Gruppe 47. I want to jump in with thunder and lightning. Yes! Oh well, everything... Everything is grace, as Bernanos says. THIS - STAGE - IS - NO - WORLD AS - THE - WORLD - IS - NO - STAGE Offending the Audience Director: Claus Peymann, 1966 You gluttons! You wiseacres! You smarty-pants! You ladies and gents you, you who are present you! You who embrace life! You worthy listeners you, you fellow humans you! -Back then, did writing come naturally to you? Oh no, no, no. That was all taboo. Writing in any way, taboo. These days nothing is taboo anymore. -How was it taboo? Well, writing is not normal. Writing breaches a taboo. You can't do that. There is something in you that says you are not permitted to write. You can't write that down. You can go dancing, you can play the jaw harp, no, not even that, you can... you can cut wood, you can glean wheat, you can bind sheaves; those things don't even exist anymore. You can bring the cows to the meadow, herd them, bring them home. Writing was not normal, simply not normal in that sense. He's crazy. You can feel it too. Feel it even today. ln everything l write you can sense the threshold, ...that the threshold establishes the rhythm. Rhythm doesn't exist as method, as structure, or as system. "The suspension of memory:" Yet another time I saw my brother walking across an icy snowfield. He who crosses the snow field will make sure to walk carefree with light feet; under the sheen the ice layer is still hard. He will make sure not to fall out of the orderly flow of movements... ...in which he has climbed into at the beginning of his walk. If he loses his pace... ...this brings forth his collapse. Just like he started to go, he is impelled to continue. That's my favorite part. If... What nonsense! If he stops, his sudden weight will thrust him through the ice. Even if he begins to run, the impact of his step will make him break through the icy crust. To make the weight of the body identical at each of its parts, he will set aside all his burdens before walking. The first steps only leave behind the flat print of his shoe in the frost. He has found the order of movements that will lead him out. When called, he may not stop or answer. When I called for him, he fell through. When he pulled out his left foot, the right one went through. When he pulled out his right foot, the left one went visibly through as well. When he started to run, he went through on both sides. Under the layer of ice the snow is made of dense dust. Wings of Desire Director: Wim Wenders, 1987 Tell me about the storyteller, about the one banished to the edge of the world, the childlike ancient one, and make him recognizable as everyman. Over time, my listeners have become readers and they no longer sit in a circle, but alone, and the one knows nothing about the other. I am an old man with a frail voice, but the story still rises from the depths and the gently opened mouth repeats it, as powerful as it is effortless, a liturgy for which no one needs to be let in on the secret to know what the words and sentences mean. lt's all or nothing. That won't work. It's a really sadistic system. lf you want to push it through, you can't push too hard, but not too gently either, it really is a question of Zen. lt won't go through. That's already... Have to cut it again. Sometimes l cut it at an angle. Won't work. l'll pull it... l pull, but it unravels. Look... Every needle has a different eye, after all. Maybe this one. Yes, this one is better. What if l cut it at a little slant? I've done it a couple of times, in my lifetime. Jesus Christ! Wait... There, even a little one keeps it from going through. I always collect "eleventh" commandments that don't exist yet: "Thou shalt take time." You asshole. So, now this one is ruined, too. That one goes through, but you can't take more than three stitches. So... At least... Anyway, there's almost nothing to see. -What kind of work is that? It's some kind of homework of my daughter Léocadie on three films: ''Stagecoach'' by John Ford and ''Tokyo Story'' by Ozu and ''L'Eclisse'' or ''The Eclipse'' by Michelangelo Antonioni. And l just now read it. -Are these favorite films of yourself as well, aren't they? l wouldn't say favorite films. Not an attractive way to say it. But they are great, great works, yes. ln them you can see how... how stories... can be told without story... being the decisive factor. Or that the story or the intrigue or the confrontations retain the upper hand. Where much... that doesn't happen... much not-happening, signifies what happens. Fictions can reach much deeper, can be more real than naturalistic or realistic representations. And that's what it's really about. If there isn't something of life in it that can be transformed into narrative, fiction, invention, then... ...it's not worth recounting, l find. And nowadays, at least it seems to me, they just readjust what has already been spit out, so to speak, by television and newspapers. It must be invented. And an invention is something very rare. To be permitted to invent, to be able to do so, to be required to invent is not normal... lt is a vision of sorts. It won't work without a vision. Ludwig Hohl, the Swiss writer, said: ''lmagination isn't trickery, but a warming,'' and l add to that, the heartfelt warming up of what is at hand. Of what is at hand. That is imagination. Not storytelling and all this other shit. What is at hand suddenly becomes emblematic, but in a kind of gentle summoning. That's enough, don't you think? -A phrase just came to mind, one l have read in your work: -The ''hell of formlessness.'' What am I supposed to say about that? -I ask myself what that is. Reality? -Ask yourself, not me. -Now, right here, we are probably in the hell of formlessness. Shit. Yesterday I dreamed of the mouth cavity of the dead Goethe. Dreamed a few days ago of the monster that came at me in a nocturnal corridor, gigantic, grimacing, and that I suddenly, after the initial fright, was able to laugh at, after which it was visibly ashamed, drew back its head and retreated with a shy smile. "In late spring," "in the autumn wind," "in the early winter." To make something out of longing. Papa? Papa? lt's raining. Quickly! Ah, but you're totally soaked. lt's hard to act natural. - Yes, that's true. lt's impossible. Someone seeing me from outside (from where else?) would see a person at an open, ground-floor window, in a crazily divided mirror dwelling... You want some soup? -Yes. ...then in the kitchen closing the window, a person who lives a perfectly novel-like life (which is my aim too, but this novel does not exist yet) Peter? Peter? Sophie? -Yes? Where is Sophie? Should l put my dress on to...? Peter can only work alone. He needs a lot of stillness. Yes, but he did write this book... "My Year in the No-Man's-Bay." ...we were still together then and with two children at home, Peter wrote the book half at home, half outside. That was possible at home for a short time, but not so long. Because you'd have to have a castle. You would need a castle. But there is no castle. One wing per person. That revitalized me. I had been skeptical about writing by hand, and it revived me, the stillness, the non-technicality. For me it was a new beginning of a different... not grammar, but a different rhythm in writing. People accuse me that the sentences began... they are not convoluted, but they have a different movement. l think that's true. And when you are outside with nothing technical, just pencil and paper and eraser, then... maybe you can let yourself go, in a good sense, and maybe a not so good sense. How does that work? Good God... What is prose? Prose is... don't know how it works. It's... You have something in yourself. lt is somehow... You ask yourself constantly if you should include time in the telling. So, how can l put it, time, that means the era, reality, whether you ought to transform that or whether you can do without it -what is happing now in Ukraine - whether you can do without that and can write prose solely from the reflex of images and feelings, or of the image-feelings, of... of rage, of pain, of attending, with no parallel whatsoever to historical realities. You don't know. -Mr. Handke, you once called yourself, l think, not entirely without irony, a "dweller in an ivory tower." Do you still claim that? Yes, largely because in this empty phrase, if someone is accused, really accused, that someone tells him "you live in an ivory tower" and implies by that that he is cut off from society, I find that disgusting. -That makes sense to me. You don't... l seldom see your name among signatures, when there is some big event, political engagement. ls that a principle of yours? -Yes, that's a principled position. Every part of me resists it when, for example, something outrageous happens... that l could ever soothe myself by adding my name to the rest. I think Godard said it is a kind of shame for him to sign something against the Americans in Vietnam. lt is... Yes, it is shame. -You did, however, once... Peter Handke: I always... I really always want to... You really always want to do good. Through thoughtful conversation, through criticism in the best sense, criticism means differentiating, after all. And so l naturally think... we won't talk now about why l was so absolutely alone with my written piece ''A Journey to the Rivers: Justice for Serbia'' that ran in Süddeutsche Zeitung. Why doesn't someone say now, for example, it's really unfortunate that not even one journalist somewhere says ''Yes, we reacted hysterically then, when we saw the good ones only there and the bad ones there.'' JUSTlCE FOR SERBlA l WANTED TO BE A WlTNESS PETER HANDKE'S lMAGE OF YUGOSLAVlA OF THE RlGHT TO WANTING TO UNDERSTAND CRlMlNALS HOW WE'D LlKE lT TO BE BLACK AND WHlTE HANDKE, MILOSEVIC AND THE THEATER CAN HE WHO WRITES GREAT POETRY BE GREATLY MISTAKEN? -The basic question, Mr. Handke... Akademietheater Vienna, 1996 -...the basic question for me is why you never traveled to Bosnia? -l didn't ask you that. l was one who did not travel to Bosnia. The only one. Please... -Just accept that. l did not travel to Bosnia, that wasn't my plan. l wanted to go to the wrong side. Just accept that. l won't ever be able to answer your question. It's a puzzle. Why didn't he want to go to Bosnia? He's nuts! -Perhaps the journalists who were in Sarajevo, perhaps they were more affected than you? The word "affected.'' l can't stand to hear that word. Go home with your ''being affected!'' Stick it up your ass. -But how do you explain the years of attacks on your texts about Serbia? Well, l am l don't explain that at all, but l imagine, or l sense, that l am a man who, from his beginnings, didn't have the image that, so to speak, could have reacted in this ethical, aesthetic, moral way... not having imagined it already. Do you understand? Strange, isn't it? lt haunts me, it doesn't hurt me, but gradually it does in fact hurt me. For Peter, Yugoslavia was his second country... it was his country. That was only three years after the war in Bosnia when he wrote that. And so the trip, yes. But it was one surprise after the other, because Peter hadn't believed people will react that way. He couldn't understand that. And that was... They said he was a terrorist and that he... he is stepping on his mother's tomb. Because his mother, she was... she was the minority, the Slovene minority in Austria. And as for us in Paris, when was the article... The book came out two years after the article in the Süddeutsche Zeitung. And only journalists wrote about it, using sentences, fragments of sentences, and for example, with the massacre of Srebrenica, they said that Peter was challenging, denying, or even a word worse than ''denying,'' the massacre of Srebrenica because he said how it happened, how the massacre was even able to happen. He asks questions. And even worse, after Milosevic's burial... But Milosevic's burial, it was... there was no question that there would be a reaction like that, that the journalists were going to say, ''So now he is going to the burial of the executioner, of the monster Milosevic.'' And Peter went there to say goodbye, as he has said, to say goodbye to Yugoslavia. Farewell to the country that has been destroyed by the war, which was a civil war, originally in Bosnia. And in the Drina's presence I thought, and I think it now here at my desk: Didn't my generation fail to grow up during the wars in Yugoslavia? Grow up. Not grow up like the innumerable self-satisfied, complete, boxlike, opinion-forging, somehow worldly, and yet so small-minded members of the generation of our fathers and uncles, but grow up in what way? Perhaps thus: firm and yet open, or permeable, or with that one word of Goethe's: "Bildsam." And with this kind of maturity, I thought - as the son of a German - pull out of this history that repeats every century, out of this disastrous chain, pull out into another story. l experience it as grace even to be alive. We live today - if there was only peace in the world - we live in a time when everything is possible again. We live in a... apart from current history, whether it's Libya, Syria, or Yugoslavia, history is a monster. History is never right. But we live in a time when we could make much more of ourselves, we could create - out of ourselves - more than we actually do. This one's like night, when the birches stand at the train station, and you can only see birches, the leaves are illuminated and also the branches. That was in... ln February there still were no leaves. And gradually then... look... This here denotes a strong wind. Strong wind at night. And no wind there. And... Ah, wind again. Every night when you come home. Oh, well... And here the night is usually still: and there too, the branches are hanging. But not a single leaf yet, right? That is the 24th of March. l was born in a village and then I went to Berlin as a two-year-old. Four years in Berlin, then back to the village, in the village from '48 to '52, again for four years. -And your mother, when was she born? 1920. She would've been 94 now. And he, he's the one who only had one eye, who was blind in one eye. He studied viniculture and apple orchards and so on at the agriculture school in Maribor in Slovenia. That is my grandmother, my grandfather, my mother. -She is radiant. They are all nicely dressed, don't you think? -Beautiful. l think that might have been on the day of the Assumption of Mary, when they put a bench in the orchard... and now, we're still together. That was the entire family. And just two years later, it was over. That's when the youngest one... there... he then became like this... There, right there you can see the swastika. You can really see how happy he seems. You can see... well... -He looks utterly sad. That was my point as well. He was supposed to attend the university... He was the bright guy of the family. -But the family members of your mother who died in the war have a real presence here. Some of these here... They have had a big influence on your writing, haven't they? What kind of question is that? -Yes, that is THE question. WHO deserves a story? Or how does it happen that someone seems worthy of a story to you? Yes, maybe when there was a capacity ...for something that then never happened. When there was a great capacity, a great outline or a great fundamental structure. Or in any case, a greater structure than they ever were able to realize in life. Then you want to create some sort of compensation, or you don't want really to, rather something drives you to it, or you long for it, or it's simply natural, as it were. ...to create a balance in a narrative, so to speak. That is literature. Out of words, language emerges! lt doesn't exist, it has to become. And there is nothing more everlasting than this grown and becoming, eternally becoming, always expanding language of literature. Fortunately, inventing is the most beautiful matter of all. lnventing is creating matter. Yes. The Wrong Move Director: Wim Wenders, 1975 lt invigorates me. Something worth telling means that it invigorates me. Strangers... Strangers about whom I know very little, of whom I can just see one detail, are able to push - or even free - myself to something worth telling. As for Stendhal, he creates people who don't exist. And Balzac, too... ln his best books, experienced reality throws him towards a trajectory of people that never really lived. But even if they only exist in books, they are living within us, us as readers, unparalleled. One of the adolescent's future prospects was to live with a child later on. These prospects included an unspoken sense of community, quickly exchanged glances, sitting down with the child, irregularly parted hair, and being close together and far apart; in happy unity. The thought of a child was taken as much for granted as his two other larger future prospects: the woman who, he felt sure, was destined for him and had long been moving towards him over secret pathways, and his professional life, which alone, he thought, could offer him the freedom worthy of a human being. But these three yearnings had never once appeared to him together, joined in a single image. The mere fact of being a child, without particular characteristics, was a source of good cheer. "Innocence was a form of the spirit." And it went stealthily into the adult on the outside, resulting in those two, once and for all, becoming a pair of conspirators. Of course, children's stories are literature and they aren't being written to produce exact minutes or some kind of experience report. l think the problem is that people read them that way anyway. l mean, l do it too, l sometimes read things and think, of course l see the correspondences to reality in there. Maybe l can see more clearly what was invented as well, or what was... hoped for... Or what was altered or could be written better. -l always imagine that you could be the one who knows him best. l sometimes feel that l don't know him at all. l have no way to compare. The Wrong Move Director: Wim Wenders, 1975 l have prepared four Polaroid boxes and some other pretty things of your father, for example these. And they... That must have been in the 1960s. -Yes, yes. Definitely! Still those Beatles haircuts, so to speak. Well, that's me. -But where? The glasses... l can't remember at all. But he switches glasses ever so often... -But when? 1978. Evening, Clamart train station. 1977, also Clamart train station. l think we took a lot of photos there after school, or on the way passing by or when we waited for the train. We were constantly travelling or moving. That is my mother. Oh, that's when we were in Venice in the winter, wasn't it? Sure looks like it. Because, sometimes we were still travelling as a whole family. And this one clearly seems to be in Venice. People in profile Director: Georg Stefan Troller, 1975 Hey Werner, it's me, Peter! The artists from German TV, they persuaded me after all... What? Yes, yes. And now I don't want to be alone with Amina. And l really want to go to the seaside, because there you can be far away enough from the camera. This media-tenderness, this child and father running towards each other, the playing, that's just a tiny part, when you don't know about the moments of failure, moments of inadequacy towards the child. Every day, still, perhaps less than before, there are moments when l know: now l have failed. Now with the child... I simply did not achieve what I wanted. And then l simply feel that my whole life is not right. Because of such banal things. That my whole life is not right. You really have a bump there. There, there now. Without ever forming an opinion of "children" in general, he believed in this particular child. He was convinced that the child embodied an important law which he himself had either forgotten or never known. Every since the very first moments of her life, he had seen her as his personal teacher. What he had faith in was not any particular utterance from the mouth of a "babe," but her mere existence as a human being. That went hand in hand, this peculiar situation with the child, which she no longer is, to be alone and in addition almost a model life alone with child and suburb and nature and being alone... that fulfilled me. -Do you mean in terms of the daily rhythm? Also the weekly rhythm. Nothing is paradise, but there are hints of paradise in my experience back then. Fortunately. And I am incredibly thankful, that gave me a lot of... stimulation or impetus or intimation for just continuing. lt is common to say that a writer flees from life through his writing. That seems so completely absurd. lt is precisely a writer, or someone like me, who experiences life... in the least protected and most brutal and in another sense the most intensive manner, because he has no systems in place that could protect him. No home remedies to keep him from dying, from fear of death. No diversionary tactics to protect him from hate and love. l think a writer who works without systems, is exposed to life in the most terrifying and most blissful ways. So just the opposite of what they say. What was that? Oh yes. Look! I was the one who did it. No, that is yours! So... Just a minute, now l have to remember... You see... this hand here... -What is that? From this series, l did the cover drawings. How was it meant again? No, this way around. l imagined it this way. While reading... -I never knew that... When I hold the book this way, it's basically my hand while reading the story. -With Kindergeschichte l thought l had never read such a thing, an adult describing life together with a child in that way. l'm not describing it, that's difficult. lt's just an evocation of stations that l, as the one experiencing or also as the one suffering and at the same time as the one acting terribly, as in the story with the beating, how l... Oh, perhaps that's why the hand... the slap. -Can you still remember the slap? Just from stories. l can remember it better from your story than from reality... ...getting slapped. Sometimes it's... strange. -That was a terrible slap. Yes, but for me some things... Memory differentiates so strangely, differentiates so starkly.... For me some other things were more horrible than the slap. For instance, even if it is a bit clichéd, when my mother went away, l remember that. -l don't believe a word of it. Believe it or not, that's how it was! You were certainly relieved. -No, it was terrible! Okay, now we're going to fictionalize it, but that's the way it was. But it is... I think I'm not old enough yet to completely understand these grand and sorrowful things she had to experience. I often had a sense for what was sorrowful and depressing... Not only am l wrong for her but the situation is actually... but she was so quiet... And now she talks more. But there is nothing worse, nothing more alarming than when a child is absolutely quiet. Yeah, but it also was a nice quiet. Where did you buy your coat? This one? From C&A. -Oh. Can you tell what color it is? -lt's red, right? -Yes. Yes, l'm not wearing red-green today by accident... Your pants are green. -Slightly greenish. At some point l decided that everything is strange and everything is new and everything is undiscovered. And also: No one has ever known what a human soul is. And so, that invigorates me. Nothing has been told yet. Everything has been told, but my variant of today, of the year 2014... lt will be useful too, at least I need it, at least to scrape reality with. Then I sense... l never sense the life of others so intensely, and my own life, life as a field to be harvested, than when l write. l'm acting intense there... It really does say ''During the previous night my mother committed suicide. '' 20th of November 1971 in Kronberg: ''Amina is 2 years, 7 months today and during the previous night my mother committed suicide. '' The Sunday Edition of the Kärntner Volkszeitung carried the following item under "Local News": "In the village of A (G township), a housewife, aged 51, committed suicide on Friday night by taking an overdose of sleeping pills." My mother has been dead for almost seven weeks; I better get to work before the need to write about her, which I felt so strongly at her funeral, dies away and I fall back into the dull speechlessness, with which I reacted to the news of her suicide. Yes, get to work... Because the need to write something about my mother as abrupt as it sometimes is, is on the other hand so indefinite again, that some work effort becomes necessary, so that I do not simply, as it would suit me just now, tap the same letter on the paper again and again with the typewriter. I might just as well take a trip - if I were travelling, my mindless dozing and lounging around would't get on my nerves so much. I don't give a shit. If that's the way he sees it, then he should do it. Yes, yes, yes. That's good, Frau Peters, that you call me. Somehow it irritates me, still, that photo in Vienna. lt seems to me that the entire production stands or falls with the doctored photo of my mother, don't you think? That irks me somehow. You can't treat a once-living person that way, that you fabricate a photo of her with Hitler, that shows her in the crowd cheering Hitler in Klagenfurt. And secondly, that my mother is supposed to have kept that secret in the production. That's no fiction. It's a harebrained invention. A willfulness that no one else shares. I just wanted to get that off my mind. Let's not make it into a scandal. But it's too bad... All the best, see you soon. Thanks. You can't fabricate that way. That is my only book for which l invented nothing. At the end l did a little... l was a little like Flaubert and ''Madame Bovary,'' where Flaubert is said to have been Madame Bovary. l am, so to speak, the Doppelgänger, when my mother dies, l became a kind of Doppelgänger. But then l imagined, no, not really, no... l didn't imagine anything... for moments I accompanied her. The woods began right outside the graveyard wall. Fir woods on a rather steep hill. The trees were so close together that you could see only the tops of even the second row, and from then on treetops after treetops. The people left the grave quickly. Standing beside it, I looked up at the motionless trees: For the first time, nature seemed truly merciless to me. So those were the facts. The forest spoke for itself. Apart from these countless tree tops, nothing mattered; in front of them an episodic tumult of figures, that were more and more out of the picture. I felt ridiculed ...and became truly helpless. All at once, in my impotent rage, I felt the need to write something about my mother. Then again, something cheerful: In a dream, I saw all sorts of things that were intolerably painful to look at. Suddenly someone came along and just took the sorrow out of things just like taking down an out-of-date poster. The comparison, too, was dreamt. Play the game. Endanger your work even more. Don't be the protagonist. Seek the juxtaposition. But be intentless. Have no thoughts in the back of your head. Keep nothing secret. Be soft and strong. Be sly, enter the fray, but despise victory. Don't observe, don't test, but stay alert to be ready for signs. Be shakable. Show your eyes, wave the others on into the depths, care for the spaces and behold each one in their own image. Act only with enthusiasm. Fail with ease. First of all, take your time and take detours. Get distracted. Take a vacation, as it were. Forget your kin folk, strengthen the strangers, bend down for trinkets, dodge into the emptiness of man, screw the fate, spit on misfortune, laugh conflicts to smithereens. Move in your own colors until you are in the right and the leaves' rustling turns sweet. Walk about the villages. I will follow you. ENGLISH SUBTITLES CREATED BY ADORNOIR, 2023
