(Ambient, melodic, MUSIC begins to play) (somber VIOLIN sets in) SERENA: Do you think Mom would approve of this? NATHAN: Probably not. But then again do we approve of what she thinks? NATHAN (O.S): Are you ready to go in? NATHAN: Come on. Let's do this. Just... You'll see... Once we're in there it's all gonna be easier. SERENA: I can't do this. NATHAN: Serena... Come on. It's time. (Musical TONE begins, CHIMES rise) BIANCA: Oh, Nathan! Serena! Finally! We thought you'd never arrive! NATHAN: Oh, it was such a long drive up the coast and traffic... Well, Serena? How you... um... how are um... how you... Come here. Come in, guys. BIANCA: Aunt Irene hasn't been feeling well all day. You know how sensitive she is to visitors. We arrived last night and I think that was already too much for her. Chris can't wait to see you guys. CHRIS: Hey you guys! NATHAN: Hey big bro! CHRIS: What took you so long? What's up, man? NATHAN: Hey. SERENA: Hi. CHRIS: Munchkins. So, um, listen Aunt Irene isn't feeling well-- BIANCA: I already told them. CHRIS: Oh. Ok, well... she's in the living room, I gotta... BIANCA: Before we go in, would you mind covering... you know... SERENA: No, I don't know... NATHAN: You can't even see her tattoos. BIANCA: That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about those... NATHAN: You can't be serious! BIANCA: Aunt Irene is a different generation. NATHAN: So suicide was more acceptable today then it was back then? BIANCA: Please, I'd like to keep the peace. Let's not make this difficult. She doesn't know. Thank you. Thank you. BIANCA: Aunt Irene? AUNT IRENE: Yes dear? They're here. They're here. Nathan! Nathan! NATHAN: Hi! NATHAN: How are ya? BIANCA: Aunt Irene? AUNT IRENE: Yes dear? BIANCA: Serena came with him... AUNT IRENE: Well... My, my, my. I can see that. How tall you've grown. Just like your mother. You do look an awful lot like your mother. I'm... I'm sure you would like to unpack. NATHAN: Come on, Serena. SERENA: I'm not unpacking. I'm not staying here. NATHAN: Pull yourself together. SERENA: I came here for you. NATHAN: Don't be so fucking ungrateful! You know what this means to us. If Aunt Irene gets upset, it's over. It all just seems so wrong. Do you know how long she'll live? No, neither do you! The doctors are giving her 2 months. She looks fine to me. She's not fine! Pancreatic cancer is a bitch. This is our chance! Well, at least you're not gonna be short on clothes for the funeral. BIANCA: They're taking an awfully long time to come down. CHRIS: Well, would you be eager to be here if you were them? I just don't want them to upset her. They can ruin everything. CHRIS (O.S.): Ruin what? Nothing. Bianca... don't go down that road. BIANCA: What road? CHRIS: You know what I'm talking about... I just don't want her to think that the only reason we're here is -- AUNT IRENE: Oh... Don't mind me. Can you please be more careful? I'm sorry. She's like a grandmother to me. But she isn't, is she? So, raising my mom doesn't count? Yes, of course... and throwing her out and banning her from the family like she's not a person, counts too... Look you don't understand her generation or the circumstances, so don't judge her for something you know nothing about. AUNT IRENE: Hmm... Blackie, what do you think? What do you think? Hm? You're not the only animal in the family now. Now we have vultures, yeah, vultures. Hm. NATHAN: Did you see how fuckin' stupid Bianca looked at you? She's such a fucking kiss-ass. Oh, Aunt Irene...! And then she had the nerve to agree with her on you looking like Mom? What the fuck? SERENA: Yeah. NATHAN: I don't know why Chris married her. I wouldn't hit that shit if you paid me. Would you? Just think about last time when she was all in your face about not wanting kids. Remember? She was all in your face. Now don't just stand there like that. Why are you standing like that? I don't know. Cause you look like a fuckin' freak right now. I'm sorry. Pull yourself together, will ya? One day, I'm... I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna tell her, ya know. Ya know, I'm just gonna grab her and I'm just gonna... (DOOR CLOSES) Anyway. BIANCA: May I come in? AUNT IRENE: Yes, you may. Leg massage? I won't say "no" to that. Nathan looks great, don't you think? Yes, dear. Serena on the other hand... No, dear. It's shocking how much she looks like her mother, isn't it? Hmm, frankly, I was shocked by that. Yes. I'm not sure what she does these days. I think she's playing the drums or something like that. Oh, Well... Some people have to make a lot of noise to be heard. I have a lot of confidence that Nathan is going to be quite successful. Who knows, one day he might even do as well as Chris. Now, you and Chris are wonderful. It's not easy to live up to that. Aww, thanks. Thanks, Aunt Irene. AUNT IRENE: Well, thank you. So... tell me. When are you planning on having your next baby? Um, uh... well... we're... we're not sure at the moment. What do you mean you're not sure? Aren't you trying? Well... We're definitely thinking of the possibility of-- The possibility? I really hope that your having another baby is not just a possibility. You are the only one to carry on the family line. It would break my heart if you... ...Agh! Oh. Oh, please, don't get upset, Aunt Irene. It's not good for you. Let me get you something to drink. GEORGE: How are you, man? CHRIS: Fine... man. I'm fine. CHRIS: Fine... man. I'm fine. GEORGE: Is that you? Yeah. Doesn't look like you at all. Then why did you ask if it was me? You were looking at it. Would you excuse us? GEORGE: Oh, yeah, sure. No problem, man. CHRIS: Thanks, man. SERENA: It was all such a long time ago. CHRIS: Yeah. I was just thinking, Mom and I used to hold hands and walk down this path. What I would give to have her here now, right? SERENA: She wouldn't give. True. Very true. I keep forgetting how hard this must be for her. SERENA: Her tree is still there. CHRIS: Yeah, I saw that. I'm surprised that Aunt Irene hasn't just hacked it to pieces yet. SERENA: Listen, Chris... I know that Bianca hates me but I'm really glad that we don't have that drama between us. CHRIS: One less, huh? Hey, Bianca doesn't hate you, alright? You guys, you don't know each other well enough. How are you doing? I mean... really? Are you recovering? SERENA: I'm doing a lot better. Thanks for having the guts to ask me that question. Sometimes it's... It's hard for people to know how to deal with this stuff. I bet. Look, everyone blames themselves if it goes wrong but if... you know, everything turns out okay, then... people don't even really wanna talk about it. If it goes right, you mean... Come on, Serena. Did you... Did you really want to die that badly? I didn't wanna die at all. Then why? Because... I also didn't wanna live. BIANCA: Aunt Irene has asked everyone to come up to the living room. SERENA: Why? No one knows, but I have a hunch. NATHAN: Aunt Irene wants to see us! CHRIS: We know. We're coming. NATHAN: What the fuck's going on? SERENA: I don't know. NATHAN: Maybe that bitchy old hag's finally made her decision. Thank you everyone for coming. I don't want to make this more awkward than it has to be, but there are some things that you need to know and I thought this was the best way to do it. Lester, why don't start. You introduce yourself. LESTER: Well, first of all... I solemnly would like to welcome everyone. AUNT IRENE: Lester... Let's not make this too official. As you wish. My name is Lester Milford and I'm Ms. Hilgrim's executor of will. NATHAN: Will? As... as in... her testament? Yes. NATHAN: Sorry, I... I just wanted to make sure I understood. LESTER: Irene has been so kind as... to give me this great responsibility to share with all of you, which of course, is an extreme honor -- Lester! Please. The short version. The short version. Of course. The estate and all assets... as well as all savings of Ms. Irene Hilgrim... shall be split equally... ...amongst all of you. Amongst all of us? That is correct. Such a wise decision! Yes... yes! Such... such a wise decision. Ah, well... Everything you need to know you've just heard. There isn't anything else to say. So, let's all go about our day, shall we? Lester... NATHAN: What a fucking cunt! What a... Ugh! Fucking, fuck! Calm down, Nathan. NATHAN: She did this on purpose! Why else would she include Bianca! She isn't a part of our family just cause she married Chris! She has no right! Her part belongs to me... and to you! You should be the maddest! Remember how she treated you last time? Remember? Yes, I remember. NATHAN: I just hate her! We shouldn't have to share anything with her! SERENA: It's just a house. NATHAN: Just a house? Have you completely lost your mind? You're not starting with that whole "I'm a punk, I'm non-materialistic, I need to go back to the clinic" attitudes again, are you? No... not at all. I'm just saying that there's enough left over for the rest of us. Serena... You disappoint me. You don't have my back. Everyone back-stabs me and now you. You of all people don't see what this is doing to me? She is doing this because she hates me! And you have the nerve to say that this is just a house? You're the only one here that understands me and... and now -- SERENA: No! I get it! I get it. I really do. I see where you're coming from. I agree. She's awful. I'm on your side, Nathan. I'm always on your side. You know that, right? If you of all people... No, I totally get it. I totally see it now... She's trying to hurt you, because she hates you. Right? You see it! Of course I see it. It's horrible! I'm so sorry. Thank you, Serena. You're the only one who's on my side. We can't trust anyone else. It's just us. I know. It's just us.... BIANCA: Ahhh! CHRIS: Shhh... I don't want anyone to hear us. BIANCA: I do. BIANCA: Ahhh! CHRIS: What are you doing? What is wrong with you? It's not proper, is it? No. Especially not in this house. Somebody probably heard us. Do you know how embarrassing that is? Oh, Aunt Irene's probably loving it. What? She brought up the baby issue again. You're ungrateful. Do you know that? She just shared everything she had with you! Everything she had. She's still alive, you know. Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that It shows how you think. Do you know what I think? I think, I don't want any of her money. Are... Are you thinking only of yourself? If you don't want it, fine, but what... what about Stefanie? What if we decide to have another baby? Exactly! That's why she included me in her will. She wants to bribe me. To bare another child unto your fucking clan. Honey, you're irrational. Don't you wish. Enjoying the pool I see. Yes. I love it. Thank you. It's amazing! Come sit with me when you're done. Of course. AUNT IRENE: Is there a problem? SERENA: No. Not at all. When your mother was a little girl she always liked to swim here just like you. I was watching you from my window and just for a second I thought... she's returned. Some people just hurt you. And sometimes they are your own. Doesn't matter how much you try to please them, to understand them, try to give them everything they want... they still don't love you back. I know that Mom loves you very much... and misses you a lot. If she loved me she wouldn't have disappeared with some lousy, low-class, bastard like your father. Yes? Is there something you wanna say? No... Not at all. Now Chris' father... he was a true, true gentleman. And he knew how to handle your mother and handle her right. It's such a priviledge to marry into that family. Chris' father was a direct descendant of a British count. You know? You don't give that up... you don't just throw that away to lust after some white-trash pseudo musician. She loves Dad a lot. And I do too... Speaking of love... I hear you have a girlfriend, not a boyfriend? Who told you that? That's because of your father, isn't it? What? Yeah, just... just wondering. I just heard someone calling me from the house. Oh, I don't hear anyone. SERENA: Yeah. I did. I'm sorry. I... I'll be back. Hey, hey, hey, what happened? Aunt Irene is the biggest bitch I've ever met. If she wasn't dying, I -- What? Whoa, whoa, what did she do? She started talking shit about my dad and then implied that I'm a Lesbian because of him! Because of your father? Yeah, I didn't get it either. She's full of shit! Shit just fucking comes out of her mouth. Hey, watch your fucking language, Missy! Look. She's old and she's bitter, okay? She doesn't have a clue how these things work, just... be the bigger person and let it go. CHRIS: Alright? Shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit! Woah! It's just me! No ghost or anything. What's for dinner? Soup. What kinda soup? Chicken soup. Chicken soup. Okay... You know what surprises me? It surprises me that Aunt Irene has taken such a liking to you that she would include you in her will. So, lemme get this straight. You come here, while I'm busy cooking for all of you and you accuse me of being a damn legacy hunter? Shame on you, Nathan. Shame on you. You know... your Swedish accent comes out when you're angry... (in SWEDISH) Eat that! CHRIS: There's no way! AUNT IRENE: No, I'm... I'm telling you this. So then he says to me, "well, my lady, if that's the way you see it, I will excuse myself and learn to masterfully satisfy your roses! I'm sure he just means well. Oh, I'm sure he does. But George is certainly the strangest gardener I ever had. Listen, I wanted to tell you that um... it made me really happy that you included Bianca in your will. And it made me even happier that you included Serena. That, hmm, that took a lot of soul searching for me. You know I love your father, but hers... that... low class, uneducated, you know, white trash-- Okay, hold on. At least he doesn't use Mom as a punching bag like mine did... AUNT IRENE: I never believed that! That was her excuse for leaving and running off with this... ...Man... Thank you very much, dear, this, "man". Anyway, it was a very difficult decision to include Serena and Nathan for that matter because they are their father's children. But you know, it was easier with Nathan, because he is a good kid. He comes to visit me, you know and he sends me cards and calls me at Christmas and on my Birthday. But Serena... never made any effort, you know. It was the right decision. I feel good about it, yeah. Good. And you know that Serena is not a Lesbian because of her father. Well, you know... I don't know anything about things like that and I don't care. CHRIS: Uh-huh, well... I'm just telling you. Well, thank you for teaching this old fox a few new things about love, my dear. CHRIS: It's my pleasure. Mom's doing well by the way. Ah, do you... do you hear somebody calling from the house? CHRIS: No, I didn't hear anything. Oh, I think I hear somebody calling. I just learned that from little Serena. I love you, you old fox. Well, never mind. NATHAN: Serena? SERENA: Hmmm? You know I wonder how much it actually comes out to. Well, if we split the estate four ways and her savings I don't think there's much left for anyone. I'm thinking about talking to Lester Milford to find out more details. If splitting everything four ways severely decreases our inheritance, I think it's time for some action. Bianca for instance-- Bianca isn't the problem, Nathan. NATHAN: Of course she is! Do the fucking math! SERENA: I don't want anything from Aunt Irene anyway. Now listen up! Do you have any idea what this money could mean to us? Bianca's portion won't make that much of a difference. That's what I'm trying to find out. Why don't you just ask Aunt Irene directly? NATHAN: Have you lost your mind? Oh, yeah, that's right. You just spent the last month in an insane asylum. Don't do this, Nathan. Well, you're not stable. I keep forgetting. Have you talked to Doctor Phillips yet today? No, not today. You know you're supposed to call him every day. Yes, I will. I'm the one in charge of you. I'm the only one on your side. I can't let you slide back -- SERENA: I will call him right now. Good. Remember... you're still not yourself. You think you might be, but you're not. You've proven how good you are at making your own decisions. If it weren't for me, you'd be in a coffin right now. AUNT IRENE: Hmmm. This tastes wonderful. What type of soup is this, Bianca? It's chicken. Tastes like onion. It's just delicious. Aw, thanks, Aunt Irene. Thank you, Aunt Irene. Excuse me, Nathan... is there something you'd like to say? No. Nothing. What? AUNT IRENE: So... Serena... what is that girlfriend of yours like? Did I mention what's for dessert? CHRIS: Uh, no... but we can't wait to hear about it, honey. It's a very special treat. Onion pie? Mousse au Chocolat. Huh! Aw, my favorite! Oh, my dear. How lovely! Nathan... now it seems to me that you have something to say. I'll let you know when I have something to say, how's that? Sounds like a plan. Did I miss something? Oh, no, Aunt Irene. Everything is just fine. Will you excuse me a moment. (Intense, deep PIANO swells) SERENA: They don't have the power over you. Don't give them power over you. Don't give them the power over you. Don't give them the power over you. They have no power over you. They have no power over you. They have no power over you. (PIANO swells, VIOLINS rise to crescendo...) (KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK) BIANCA (O.S.): Serena? Are you in there? SERENA: Yes. BIANCA (O.S.): Are you ok? SERENA: Yes, can you just give me -- Can I have a minute to myself?! BIANCA (O.S.): Of course. SERENA: No one's helping you? BIANCA: Nope. I don't need any help. Why don't you go into the living room and join the others? Thank you. I guess the kitchen's old school women's territory in this house. SERENA: How's your daughter? She's good. She's with my parents over the weekend. It's weird to be apart from her. SERENA: I'm sure you're a really good mom. I try my best. SERENA: Well, the soup was delicious. BIANCA: Just a little heavy on the onion, I suppose. SERENA: I can't cook at all. I once tried to make a Lasagna - NATHAN (O.S.): Serena! NATHAN: You're being missed in the living room. SERENA: Of course. NATHAN: What are you doing? SERENA: What do you mean? You're talking to that uber bitch like she's your friend! I'm just trying to make conversation. NATHAN: I hate her, because of you. What she did last time-- SERENA: ...was last time. She was just trying to set my head straight, when I was down. Yeah, it was harsh, but... I think she was right. NATHAN: She's pure hate, pure evil, pure bile. I'm not so-- You don't know! You have no idea how spiteful she is. You and I need to stay on the same page or we're gonna go crazy in this house. Remember... I'm your life raft. I'm here for you and you're here for me and... together, we'll get through this. Ok? Ok. AUNT IRENE: Haha... you know. CHRIS: There you are! AUNT IRENE: Ahhhh! NATHAN: Well, we're just coming to say, "good night". AUNT IRENE: What? Already? But it's only 9. NATHAN: Serena is exhausted from the travel and should sleep now. CHRIS: Well, if that's the case... Serena? Is that the case? SERENA: Yes, I'm very tired. I'm sorry. CHRIS: Okay then. Good night. SERENA: Good night. NATHAN: See... they don't give a fuck. Let's just smoke a J and go to bed. My God... (TECHNO music plays) (TECHNO music plays) (TECHNO music plays) (TECHNO music plays) (TECHNO music plays) NATHAN: See... you and I have a great time when they're not around. They're all pigs. Look at what happened to you and no one wants to talk about it. It's like they're afraid of it. It's like something to be embarrassed about. They'll never accept you for who you are. But I'll always be on your side. Who was always there when Mom was working and no one else gave a shit, huh? I'm really grateful for you, Nathan. Here, pass it. (MUSIC fades out) BIANCA: I'm sorry about today. CHRIS: It's ok. I love you. BIANCA: I love you, too. CHRIS: It's just... can't keep seeing bad things everywhere and think that everyone's up to no good. People aren't like that. Not everyone wishes others bad. No... you're right. You saw how Nathan reacted at the dinner table, though, right? I did, but he's just a douche sometimes. It's nothing to worry about. Are you even listening to me? Yes. Ok. You're right. Seriously. Stop making up stories. BIANCA: The furnace is broken, isn't it? AUNT IRENE: It gets awfully cold in here. The good thing about dying... I won't have to deal with that anymore. BIANCA: I admire you. AUNT IRENE: Why is that? BIANCA: I don't think that I could just talk about my own death like you do. AUNT IRENE: Well, they say... what doesn't kill you, makes you stronger... even if only for a few more weeks. But you know... I'm not afraid of dying, because my legacy will continue. That's all that matters. There really is only one more wish I have in life. What's... what's this? It's for your next baby. I made it. I wanted to make it so that your next baby would always remember me. I see. BIANCA: Um... I'll be right back. CHRIS: What are you doing out here? BIANCA: I can't breathe! What's wrong? Are you okay? It's your Aunt Irene. CHRIS: We can't just be peaceful? Just once? She just gave me a baby blanket that she made for our next child. Well, that was sweet of her. You don't understand! This is putting me under so much pressure. She's trying to put a guilt trip on me! How dare you even think something like that? She is old and she is bitter, Fine. But she is not manipulative! You don't see it. Because she is your family. She's not mine. I can't... I can't stay out here and listen to this. Do not talk to me again until you've come to your senses. Oh Serena! I didn't see you there. Sorry. I didn't mean to spy on you. Is everything ok? Yes. Everything's fine... Except for you know I'm gonna have to kill you now. I can't have witnesses to my breakdowns. Some of us have life long witnesses to our breakdowns. Can I have one? You? You smoke? I used to... I used to be a chain smoker before I met Chris. Why does the blanket bother you? Because I don't want another child. Chris told Aunt Irene and now she does this. Why don't you want another child? You're like the perfect mother. Perfect mother! Oh, the sound! Do you know why I'm the perfect mother? Guilt. I don't understand. You know they tell you that motherhood is the best thing that can ever happen to you. When I was pregnant with Stephanie I was so excited. I couldn't wait to give birth to that dream child. But then... when she was born I... I felt nothing. What do you mean you felt nothing? Go ahead! Judge me... they call it postpartum depression and it's the most embarrassing, shameful thing in the world because you're supposed to be happy. But instead you wanna run. I love her, that's for sure and things are better now. I guess I'm used to it now. But I know, that I don't want another child. It'd be like a crime... Another kid with an emotionally unavailable mother who overcompensates her lack of motherly instinct by being the picture perfect mom with a... empty heart. SERENA: Wow... Now I need another smoke. SERENA: Careful, might make you sick. I already feel sick. At least then I have a reason. CHRIS: Oh. There you are. Hey, I wanted to see if there's any way you could help me take a look at the furnace. In a minute. CHRIS: Uh... great. Doesn't have to be right now, just... whenever... Nathan? NATHAN: You know, I love Bianca. Don't get me wrong, it's just... Imagine Aunt Irene had left my girlfriend part of the estate. Or Serena's girlfriend. Hmm? How would you feel? I don't think I wanna hear this. I just think it should be split within the family. Everyone gets more. Then we can decide to split it with whomever we choose. But I don't think it's fair that we have to split a three way inheritance, four ways. Okay, um... Don't ever compare my wife to a girlfriend. And don't you ever imply that she's not a part of this family. She is the mother of my child. CHRIS (O.S): And has taken care of Aunt Irene like any blood relative would. She's entitled to just as much as we are. Don't ever bring this up again and don't you dare mention a word of this to Aunt Irene. Do we understand each other? Do we? Yes. Oh, Blackie baby... did you hear that? Did you hear that? Too much noise. No, we don't want to hear that. SERENA: Do you know how it feels when... everything you've ever believed in turns out to be a lie? Do you know how it feels when... everything you've ever loved just disappears? When you don't even trust yourself anymore or anything you do, because you fuck up all the time? When you think because you simply exist you should be locked away because as soon as you leave the house... as soon as you open your mouth... as soon as you even just... think, you fuck up! I do. No, you have no clue. You have everything. You've never experienced shit! And how do you know? You look at me and you see an image that I've created for the world to see, but you don't care enough to look at what's hidden behind the facade. I'm one person when I'm dealing with Aunt Irene... I'm a different person when I'm with my old friends. Isn't everybody like that though? A pleaser, you mean? Yeah, a pleaser. We mirror the people we talk to. It's normal. Normal. Well, maybe it's... that normality that makes us sick. The fact that I don't have the guts to go and tell Aunt Irene how I really feel. Why don't you? You just can't do that. Yes, you can! Let's go! Right now! What? You should go to her right now and tell her everything she's ever done to you. No. She doesn't even know you. I'm done being eaten up inside... I'm alive. And so are you! And you should show her. Why? Why do we give people the power over us to control us, to hurt us, to keep us quiet? I'm done being quiet! NATHAN (O.S.): Serena...? Did I just hear you yelling? No. I'm fine. I'm okay. Are you sure? Yes. I was just telling Bianca something and I got really passionate. Okay, then. Just take a deep breath, okay? Remember what we talked about? Yes. Ok. Why do we give people the power over us, to control us, and keep us quiet? You better take a good look in the mirror, Serena. Oh! Nathan, darling! Are you having a good time or are you bored to death with us old folks? Aunt Irene, I always have a wonderful time when I'm here, you know that. So... How's life? It's great. I mean, I'm making a lot of progress with my business degree and... I met this amazing girl. Oh, is that right? Yeah. You'd just love her. I'm sure I would. NATHAN: Would you like to see a picture? Well, of course. AUNT IRENE: Awe! Pretty! NATHAN: Yeah, I think so, but then again, I'm biased. NATHAN: Oh... AUNT IRENE: What was that? NATHAN: Oh, uh... Was that Serena? Uh... Yeah. She looked like a drug addict in that picture. Come on. Tell me. Don't hold anything back. If she is a drug addict, I need to know that. Well, so... you haven't heard? Well... um... AUNT IRENE: Will you stop dragging your feet. Just you tell me. You can trust your old aunt. Serena is unstable. She's in with a bad crowd. Oh! Is that right? Yeah. You didn't... you didn't hear it from me, but she even... um... She spent the last month in an insane asylum... I'm sorry, a mental institution. Why wasn't I informed of that? I think they thought it might affect her chances of being included in your will, but... I... I'm not sure... okay? Thank you so much, Nathan, for telling me that. I'm sure that was very difficult for you to do since Serena is your sister... Are you ok? I just, I just need to think now. Of course, Aunt Irene. BIANCA: There you are. CHRIS: It's cold out there. BIANCA: I know and it's supposed to be California. CHRIS: And... have we calmed down a bit? BIANCA: I... actually had a really good conversation with Serena. With Serena? Turns out, we have quite a bit in common. That is surprising. I think last year's drama is finally coming to an end and... I don't know... I just... I just really related to her. It was weird. People change you know. Hold on. You and Serena... bonding? She's not as bad as I thought. She's a very bright person... in a very dark place. And, I know her exterior might be a little punkish or whatever they call it, but she's so real. It feels really good to have someone that real around for a change. Well, I'm just happy if you don't hate my entire family. It's a trust thing, you know. Yeah. I know. They can be tough sometimes. BIANCA: Hm-hm. Come here. NATHAN: Bianca is hardcore attacking Auntie. SERENA: Attacking? NATHAN: Yeah, you know, slime, slime. I still don't know why she's putting up this show. Makes me think she's up to something. Maybe she is. Maybe she isn't. It's none of our business. The will was read. End of story. I don't want any of the money anyway. Yeah, but... When I saw them talking... I saw them talking and, and, and they looked at me and... Fuck. Bianca had this look like... like I caught her doing something. Just let it go! Can you please not raise your voice at me? Sorry. I'm just on edge. I'm not so sure Bianca is who you think she is. Meaning? I think she's kinda cool... Have you talked to Doctor Phillips yet today? SERENA: I don't need to talk to Doctor Phillips today. I'm fine. I'm just concerned about you, that's all. AUNT IRENE: Serena. I need to talk to you. Now. Of course, Aunt Irene. What is it? I'm cutting you out of my will. What? Why? Can I see your wrists? That's why. See. I told you Bianca said something to her. That fucking bitch! Told you, didn't I? BIANCA (O.S.): Oh, Serena, I wanted to tell you that I really enjoyed talking to you earlier. Why? Because I thought that-- Why did you do it? Do what? Why did you tell Aunt Irene? AUNT IRENE: What is this screaming? SERENA: She doesn't wanna have anymore children! Bianca! Is that right? Why are doing this? I'm just doing what you did to me. I didn't do anything. Don't lie! Of course you did! She has postpartum depression and is unbalanced. She's suicidal, too, and doesn't love her child! Serena, why are you doing this? I'm not taking anymore shit from anyone! I'm not staying quiet! I thought I could trust you! This isn't happening. AUNT IRENE: Enough of this nonsense! You're both out of my will! Both of you! You... are a disgrace to the family! I am deeply disappointed in you. You don't deserve Chris or this house or me. You should be ashamed of yourself. Don't look at me like that! This is a mad house. Out! Go to your room! Get out of my sight! (Slow, somber, VIOLINS play) Why did Bianca stare at me like that? NATHAN: She probably realized what she did. But she looked so shocked. Like... she didn't know what was happening. It's all in your head. She's just a fucking bitch, that's all. A fucking bitch wouldn't be so... sad. She's probably just a good actress. SERENA: No, something seems... BIANCA (V.O.): Before we go in would you mind covering... I think... BIANCA (V.O.): Aunt Irene is a different generation... Oh my God... BIANCA (V.O.): Please, I'd like to keep the peace. She doesn't know. Thank you. Oh my God, it wasn't her. She wouldn't have said anything. You're so full of shit! You just don't wanna believe that people are as fucked up as they are cause you're so naive! But... it feels wrong-- NATHAN: Cause what she did was wrong! SERENA: No, what I did. I feel like I made a terrible mistake! Cause you're a good person! See, you're so much better than her! No, I can't get her eyes out of my mind. You're making stuff up. I think she's innocent in all of this. Bullshit! Just listen to yourself! Shut up! (MUSIC slowly rises. Return to somber VIOLINS) Mom? ANNABELLE: Baby. After all these years... Blackie... ...after all these years! Yeah, yeah, that's right, that's right, darling that's right. Oh, Nathan! Please tell your mother that if she thinks she can stay in this house tonight, she is quite wrong! Of course, Aunt Irene. I'll tell her. You don't have a problem with that... do you? No, no, of course not. Uh-huh. Uh-huh, I see, that's just what I figured. I have a problem with that. I... I don't think I understand, Aunt Irene. Oh, don't Aunt Irene me all the time and I think you know what I'm talking about... Tell me... who do you care about, Nathan? I'm not sure what you're getting at right now and I really feel... it's best if I leave... now. Yes... I think that's a very good idea. ANNABELLE: I gave birth to this body... and look what you did to it... I always wanted you to be happy. Only happy. I know. Why didn't you tell me? Nathan didn't think it was a good idea. ANNABELLE (O.S.): Nathan? He's been taking care of me. Nathan...? Do you know what my greatest joy in life is? Your children? Yes. Do you understand that if you were to hurt yourself, it would be the end of me. Why did you do it? It's just... I was in... I was in so much pain. I needed to not feel anymore. I just wanted it all to stop. Some of us feel too much, don't we? You are so loved, my child. You have no idea. There's a whole world out there. And you can't hide from it. You are beautiful, amazing, kind, smart, gay-- Mom! I'm proud of that! Really? Of course! I couldn't deal with a son in law. I'd whoop his ass! Mom! I would... I would, I would, I would. Well, you two seem to be having fun. Hi honey. Aunt Irene wanted me to tell you-- I don't need you to tell me anything. Anything she needs to say to me, she can say to my face. Oh, I wouldn't do that. Ok... Why were you in the swimming pool with Bianca? Are you completely insane? Oh, yeah, I totally forgot! You are! Just looking at you it shouldn't be that hard to remember. What are you doing? The only smart thing. I'm getting out of this house, away from this shit! I'm staying with Mom in a hotel. Leaving me alone. Seems like you're coping just fine. Well, I'm not the suicidal one. CHRIS: Listen... we all have our quirks. BIANCA: Quirks are ok, being cold-hearted isn't. I don't know what you want me to say. How about you don't always defend her. Look at what she's doing to me and Serena now. Do you want me to talk to her? No. No more talking. We already said enough in these two damn days. It's the talking that makes everything worse. I don't know what you want me to do. Maybe I don't want you to do anything. NATHAN (O.S.): You're coming back tomorrow, though, right? I mean, I'm fine, but we did say we're a united front. I just need to leave the house for a night, that's all. Chris says Aunt Irene wants to have dinner with us. She has an announcement she wants to make. SERENA: Aren't we going to the hotel? I'd like to hear what she has to say. This is so fucked up! Aunt Irene, I'm sorry everything went wrong in your life, but I don't think I can subject my daughter or myself or anyone else to this abuse any longer! Good-bye! Stop! Where do you think you're going? ANNABELLE: Any place but here! I never invited you in the first place! What did you come here for? I came here because you're sick! And to take care of my daughter, because I wanna take care of her... ...of both of you... something you never taught me, by the way! You can't talk to me this way. Well, I never did and it's something I should've done a long time ago! You have just lost any privileges you ever had in this house. Don't come around me anymore. I herewith officially cut you out of my life. Don't try to call me. I don't wanna receive your Christmas cards. Don't try to contact me in any way. I am done with you. What the fuck is wrong with you? She doesn't give a shit about people. She only cares about money. Bianca! How dare you talk like that-- I'm only saying what's been on my mind for a long time. Oh yeah, go ahead, just spit it all out! You think we all want this house and your money. You... you... you... you... you think all people see in you is your money, but you're wrong! And I don't give a shit anymore! CHRIS: Honey, wait! You really did overdo it this time. I'm sorry, but I have to agree. Good-bye. NATHAN: Serena! They're all nuts. I'm still here for you, though, Aunt Irene. Don't listen to them. Out! Beg your pardon? AUNT IRENE: Out! Get out! You devil! Get out! NATHAN: You didn't go with her? SERENA: She didn't want me to come. She said there was enough tears for one night. NATHAN: So, she left you to the pack of wolves. Well, at least I'm here. Let's go to bed. Aunt Irene? Aunt Irene, are you... Are you ok? Oh, jeez! You scared me! You know there was a time when I was... ...just Irene. Not Aunt Irene, not an aunt, not a great-grand aunt. Not the owner of an estate. Not a filthy rich old... hag Just Irene. I wish I were that Irene again. That young girl... with her hopes and dreams... not knowing how her life would turn out, because it hadn't happened yet... instead of... knowing what my life had turned out to be, because it already happened. You can't think that way. Chris... I don't have much time left. I'm dying. My family is a mess and that young Irene is gone. Soon this Irene that's here... this Aunt Irene... she is going to be gone, too. Forever. How do you learn to... let go of your life, when you don't have time to learn that, because there's no tomorrow? Are you alive right now? Yeah, I guess. Then you can use every second you have left to bring Irene back. It's too late. It's too late for everything. It's all over. And all I have left is this house, and all that money that I accumulated. I never wanted any of this. Irene. You're not gone. And if you never wanted any of this, then don't hold on to it. Just let it go. You have a beautiful daughter. She's not my daughter. She's just someone I raised. Hear me out... She's the only thing worth holding onto in your life. Loving someone also means, taking them as they are. It means loving them despite their shortcomings. It's not about the things that Mom does that you disapprove of or the things that she says that you disagree with. It's about... loving her like you did when she was a little girl... and loving Serena as if she were your own grand-child. Serena is a... suicidal lesbian. Yes, she is. Nothing that fits into your book, right? Right. Yeah, well... she fits into mine. And she fits into Mom's and she fits into Bianca's. I love her exactly how she is. I mean, have you ever even tried to get to know her? What's the use? You can't teach a dying dog new tricks. Maybe not. But I can... open a dying woman's eyes who can still give the gift of love to someone who has their whole life ahead of them. Can you make me one, too? Sure. I couldn't sleep all night. NATHAN: Me neither. I had nightmares of some monster that kept trying to bite me in the ass until I turned into Aunt Irene. You think that's funny? I hate this house. Who would wanna live here anyway with all this shit going on? Well, you know who's shitty here and it's not us. This will all be over soon. What do you mean? She's gonna die. I keep wondering why she's like this. Cause she's a fucking bitch! Bianca didn't say anything to her. And you know that how? Because she told me. Just because someone says they're honest, doesn't mean they're honest. Yeah... Don't look at me like that. I wasn't. Yes. Yes, you were! You were studying me and I hate it when you study me. It makes me feel like you don't trust me when I'm the only one you can trust! I know. Don't blow your nose like that. You look totally asocial when you do that. You know, you could do it a little less nasty. I'm sorry. Why are you getting up like that? Like what? Do you even see yourself? Standing there? You look ridiculous. I'm sorry. Really, Serena. Pull yourself together. You look like a pitiful piece of shit right now. AUNT IRENE: Leave the child alone! NATHAN: I... I didn't mean to-- I can see exactly what's going on here. BIANCA: What is going on here? Nathan! You should be ashamed of yourself! To talk to your sister that way! SERENA: No, he knows what's best for me... he's only trying to help. Help you? Who made him an authority on what's good and bad? I'm just honest with her! Just because someone says they're honest, doesn't mean they are honest, my dear. You've been putting Serena down since you guys arrived. It's sickening. SERENA: He does only mean well. He's right. I shouldn't stand here like that. I look stupid. Only because he tells you so. That doesn't make it true! Serena, you are a beautiful, smart, young woman. Don't let him do this to you. My sister knows that I can help get her life back on track! Oh dear! I see! You are a predatory little devil! Serena... would it perhaps interest you to know who told me about your... scars? SERENA: No... No, that's not possible. Oh, yes, believe me. He tried to get my portion of the will and when that didn't work, he threw you under the bus. Nathan... They're lying! I wouldn't say that! Don't you see what they're doing? Don't believe them. They're full of shit! AUNT IRENE: Serena, I am an old lady. I have better things to do than to be full of... NATHAN: Serena, don't you see what's going on? They're trying to pit us against each other! But why? They have no reason. I have no reason to betray you! Yes, you do! You got a good reason. The oldest reason in the history of human kind... Serena, look at me. Look at me! Now! They have a reason. They hate you! Me! They hate us, because we're our father's children. Aunt Irene never accepted us. She just wants the both of us out of her will and Bianca's just covering her own ass! Don't you see? They're in this together! That is bullshit! She's right! This is... bullshit! How could you do this to me? Dear. Mister. Milford. I, Bianca Hilgrim, decided to divorce my husband. Will affect my chances of being included in the testament Would it be better for me to divorce him before or after her death? Kind regards, You scared me. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. My grandfather planted all these trees. Except for that one. Your mother planted that one. It's always been in the way. Always blocking my view. Never letting me forget. This was me when I was about your age. You were such a rebel! You remind me a lot of myself. I was so afraid of you when I was a child. Ah and I was afraid of you when you were a child, too. What? No, I had no idea what to do with you. I was actually really not very good with kids. At first, I didn't know what to do with your mother. You know my husband left me when I decided to raise her. I didn't know that. All I wanted for her was a good husband of her own. She had one, she blew it. Just like me. What would I give to go back to your age. Don't be too upset by your brother. You're a strong young woman. I can see that. You've got that sparkle in your eye. We all have it. Sometimes someone comes along in your life to subdue it but they can never kill it. Unless you allow it. Your life is up to you. Why do we allow the ones we love the most to control us the most? I always thought that love meant freedom... Ah... Are you ok? No. I'm dying. Does it hurt? In more ways than you know. NATHAN: You're never gonna believe what I found! Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt anything. CHRIS: You're fine. That girl... Being in love after all this time it's... a dream come true. Bianca and little Stephanie... I think I would die without them. It's amazing waking up every morning next to that person... that one person you're so fucking in love with. Do you remember Mom used to tell us that love wasn't supposed to hurt? Now I know what that means. Why is your cheek so red? Oh, I don't wanna talk about it. CHRIS: Okay, I'm sorry. What was it you wanted to show me? It's nothing. No, please, show me. No. What the heck? Just show me! Why did you do that? Cause it's just a house. (Soft CHIMES fill the air) (Soft CHIMES fill the air) (Soft CHIMES fill the air) (Soft CHIMES fill the air) CHRIS: Yeah, just leave it on my desk. I'll be back later, I'll deal with it then. I'll take care of it then. I gotta go. Mom. You shouldn't be here. She's gonna freak out if she sees you. So be it. What would you do if I said I never wanted to speak to you again? ANNABELLE (throat clearing): Ahem, hm. You? ANNABELLE: Hey. No, no, no. I told you, I don't want you in this house! I don't want to see you ever again! I'm not leaving. Oh, yes you are! You are a disgrace to this family. You're selfish! That's what you are! You're selfish! I want you to go away. I'm not going. I don't want you in this house! I don't want you anywhere near me! You just want everything I have! Get away from me! ANNABELLE: No. AUNT IRENE: I want you to leave! ANNABELLE: No. I want you to leave! Why aren't you leaving? ANNABELLE: Because... I'm not going to let you die alone.
