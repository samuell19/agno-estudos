Hello. Hi. How was your day? Good. Anything to share? An adventure or something? No. Your backpack. Hello. Hello. How is school going? Fine. Very often this curiosity is due more to the need that the child has to know his own sexuality than a desire to know exactly what his parents do in bed. Makes me think of the story of Goldilocks. Daddy Bear's bed has too high a headboard. The mama bear's footboard is too high. It shows us that both the relationship and the intimacy between them is beyond Goldilocks' reach. Okay. Well, we'll meet next week, and remember, That there is no promise of happiness possible for those who have not managed to overcome their Oedipus issues. And for those who have not resolved their lingering conflicts in a mature manner. Smell these. I'll grab some rosemary. Golden Dragon? No. We're telling Oliverio today. Hey... I'm not doing this for you. Okay. I know, I know. You won't have supper with us? No, no. Are you sure? About what? Are you serious? Oli? It's time for dinner. Coming. Turn that off, Son. Coming. Okay. I'll pause it. It's best for everyone, Oli. Where will you live? For now with Susana. With Susana? What's wrong with Susana? You've said you liked her. Just for a while. Until I find something more definitive. Do you want to go, Dad? Nope. I don't want to go. I don't want to go. Nobody wants him to go. Then don't go. - It's more complicated. - It is more complicated. I'll go get... You don't have to be so dramatic. It is not easy for anyone but it is the best for everyone. He's going to be fine. Ro! Dad? Get my phone! Bring me my phone! They're on their way to get the body ready. You are dead dad. You are dead. You are dead. Oliverio... We are very sorry. Thank you. He's in a better place. Please, Marguerite. They're making you work? No... It's me. I have to keep myself busy else the world will fall apart. I've been thinking of something to say to you to make you feel better. I don't have anything. I'm sorry. Do you know my dad died from a premonition? An aneurysm. No one dies from a premonition. Twins are supposed to have a special connection. And who knows when the other is in an extreme situation. You didn't feel anything? Nope. Rosita called me. Don't underestimate the cell phone. They're mysterious in their own way. Okay. Come with me inside? Oli... If you need something anything tell me. Which is what everyone says but really. Anything. K? People are strange. A woman congratulated me instead of giving condolences. Goodnight. Who was that? His brother. Hang on. Remus! Wait. I'm coming. You are not staying with us? The guest room is ready. Thank you but, you have seem to have a lot to deal with. Where are you going to stay? With Susana. Ok... I didn't do anything behind your brother's back. I'm not here to judge. Ciao. Everything ok? You want me to stay tonight? I can stay in the guest room. Are you sure? Oli? Where's Oliverio? He's not in his room? Oli. Oliverio. Oliverio! You slept here? Come. They're going to take your dad. Oli... You want a mint? Oli... Oliverio! I haven't seen you cry. It's... normal to show vulnerability at a time like this. Crying can be liberating. Why don't you cry then? Oliverio! SORRY, I'M SENDING YOU A HUG. LOVE AND INFINITE LIGHT. HUGS, BRO. I'M SENDING YOU GOOD VIBES AND MAGIC DUST. Take this to Oliverio please. Right now? No, whenever you can. What are you doing here? You can't be here, Dad. Come. I'm sorry, Dad. Sorry. You're not going to school? Oliverio . You have a lot to process. But it's something you should do while you go about your normal life. If you forgo responsibilities, things won't improve, they'll get worse. They snowball and what was an emotional problem becomes a practical problem as well. You lost your dad. It hurts a lot to all of us and I am devastated but you don't want to lose the school year, do you? Oliverio get up and go bathe. I'm not going! You don't plan to move from here? Perfect! Fantastic! You are going to live here? This is where you will live. Now flounder on your island! Throw them into the sea? He hated the beach. Set them on a pretty modernist piece of furniture. Just so. My dad was a weird guy. Yeah. Weirder how different you both are. Your grandmother had an explanation for that. You know it? No? Well then. It's supposed that when we were born for some strange reason, her milk only went into one breast. All of the milk was in the left one. So I got the good breast and Romulus got the bottle. Why didn't you take turns? You get the breast for a while and then my dad. You'd get the bottle for a while and then my dad. I don't know. I never asked. He's worse. I don't know what to do. He's dead set on his ostracism. Relax, Lily, it's all too recent. Give him his time and space. No, yo don't know how he looks at me. As if I were an assassin. Blame is part of the process. I'll go there tomorrow and talk to him. He'll be much more receptive to someone neutral. Rest. Try to sleep well. Take something to make you fall asleep. I love you. Lily? Perfect. Thank you very much. Bye. Everyone at school was very understanding. They understand what you are going through and won't count your absences. I spoke with Norma. She says you have to keep studying so you don't lose your place in class. someone will come to help you with your homework and catch you up. Oli. Oliverio. What? Did you hear me? Yes. Look at your shirt. You are in a self-destructive spiral. You have to do something for yourself. If you're hungry, go to the kitchen and prepare it yourself. Do it for yourself! Great! Starve me to death! No more bringing him food and coddling him! He must start moving. Generate endorphins to get out of the depressive cycle. Rosita. It's for his own good. Is that your cell phone? Come on, let's go play. Let's go. No. What a drag. Let's go. Oli doesn't get up from there anymore. That is his living space. What's up? I don't move from here. You don't move from where? Here. From the chair? It's not a chair. It's a chaise lounge. Whatever. Why aren't you moving? Why make so much effort? At any moment an artery can burst and, bye, you're dead. You're not going to school anymore? Where will you shit? Squat over the water. You'll get it all over the deck. You won't make it into the water. I won't. I'll lean over. We're going to play. I'm not moving from here. Stop fucking around. Let's go. No. I don't know what to do Arnold. Today he had a violent outburst against his best friend. He drew blood. It could have ended with tragedy. And all without moving from there. I was worried about the hate he felt towards me but, it is much more serious. He hates the whole world. I'm afraid that he can become dangerous. He needs help, Arnold. But he won't let me get close. Let me talk with him. Draw my own conclusions. Right now? Right now... right now. I'm going to get him out of that toxic bubble. - Arnold? - Yes? Be careful. Good evening. May I? Is there is something you want to tell me? Are you kidding? Everyone grieves in their own way. You have the right to feel pain, frustration... Guilt. But take advantage of the tools you have at hand. Your mother is also an excellent therapist. Not sharing with anyone what is happening to you is very dangerous because you generate a spiral of emotions that do not find an outlet. You are a time bomb. Your mother and I have plans together. And you can be part of them. But you have to do your part. It's going to take teamwork. I don't intent to replace your father. You're already big. But we can work together. Pals! But hey now we have to help your mother. She is having a very bad time. It's a difficult time. and refusing to talk to her and isolating yourself here only make things worse. I don't understand why it's a difficult or complicated time. Mom got rid of dad without all the bureaucracy. She also gets to keep everything. She should be happy. Because everything turned out better than she expected. It's always complicated. Okay. A pleasure to talk with you. Sure, "pal." How did it go? Jump. Rosita! Sorry. You should try it with me. Tomorrow. Clarity and fortitude. The house is full of cockroaches. Rosita, I know that you are sad still, but we mustnâ€™t let the house fall into disrepair. Decay is a luxury we cannot allow. Hello. Yes? I'm the volunteer so Oliverio won't lag behind in school. - And your name is? - Marianna. Ok, come in. What are you doing? What are you doing here? There's a river? It's super cute. Newton's Second Law. This law refers to the changes in velocity that a body undergoes when a force is applied. Which is called acceleration. Remember that acceleration also means changes in the direction of the moving object. It is the case when a body tied to the end of an string is rotated, since it applies a force to the object and prevents it from shooting out in a straight line. Accelerating it towards the center of the circle. Therefore we can say that the acceleration of a body is directly proportional to the applied force. The value of the constant each represents the property of the object we call "mass." Hello. Are you hungry? Yes. I'd bring you something to eat here, but Oli might want some. Come in and eat whenever you want. Let's go. Thanks. Come on. You're not friends with Oliverio? No. Not at all. I don't even like him. He's stuck up. So then why are you here? We drew straws and I lost, so I had to "volunteer." Can I ask you something? What would you think if I told you I'm your dad. Dad? What would you think? Well, the truth is that my dad died. So I would be glad. See you tomorrow. You're coming back? Of course. Every day until you go back to school. Bye. It seems to me that it is encouraging his sedentary lifestyle. No no no no no no, it's perfect! It's feeding his curiosity for the outside world without altering his passivity. It's very subtle. At any moment and he will run off in search of adventures. I'd just settle for him having dinner inside the house. We may not even see him around for a while. Will he be staying here long? Your brother-in-law... Ex brother in law... He is a disturbing presence. For the child. I'm a widow. We never divorced so he's my brother-in-law, isn't he? I guess he will be my brother-in-law forever. As you wish. It must be difficult for Oliverio to constantly see his father's face. It prevents him from accepting the loss and moving on. They look nothing alike. Good evening. Arnoldo brought a telescope for Oli. How cool! And food from the Golden Dragon. Will you join us? Sounds delicious. But I have a date with Susana. Cancel. Cancel. No, in fact I'm already late. But thanks. Bye Oli. - See you tomorrow. - Bye. Bye. Oli? What? Will you accompany us? I don't want to ruin your romantic interlude. You're insufferable! I borrowed this... To make your exile more interesting. To make it be aesthetic and not just static. You pee sitting down? You have no respect. Cougar expert. Fucking my wife in my own bed! You are a piece of shit! For giving your wife what you never could? You killed me. Cancel all appointments. Tell them it is a personal issue, and that I am very sorry. But we'll have to reschedule. Good morning. No, I do not know. I am in an emergency situation. There's a plague in my house. Try to understand, Margarita! It's getting late. You need to go. Yes? No, why now? No, no, don't put her on. Hello. Because I'm excited. I'm so happy to meet you. - What are you doing? - A striptease. You're ridiculous. Maybe it's a happy bug. Those bugs live just a few days. They don't have time to fool themselves into happy thoughts. That is why if their lives are so short, they must be super intense. "Super intense." Let that whore recover and she's gonna sting you. Then you'll be the one who get "super intense." She's not a whore. She's a worker bee. All you want is the Nobel Peace Prize. And for everyone to say how good you are. Law of conservation of momentum. The analysis of the head-on collision of vehicles of which the masses are m1 and m2. U1 and U2 represent their velocities before collision. and v1 and v2 after the collision. Let's do the experiment. I want the red one. One... Two... Three! I won. Are we finished? What happened? What did I do now? My dad died in a crash. Now what? Who's this? It's Dr. Mata. In the kitchen. I called several times but you didn't answer. I've been busy all day cleaning and disinfecting the house. I told you about the state of emergency. You look pretty as a housewife. I wanted to surprise you I thought you'd like it. I'm sick of surprises. No more surprises please. Now I feel bad because I know I should pay attention to you. But we have nothing prepared, and I'm exhausted and in a bad mood. Relax, relax... I'll go get something and wait for you to finish. I'd rather you didn't. You want me to drive back to the city at this time of night? See. You don't like surprises either. But I don't have to be responsible for your actions. At least now you know I don't like surprises. May I at least say hello to you son? Hello. So you live here now? No. I just brought something for you mother. But I'm leaving now. I wanted to know how you were. Do you know about interpreting dreams and things like that? Well... Dreams cannot be interpreted as literal as actions can be. But as a metaphorical system. Often their reverberations elude reason. They can understood as... As a subconscious attempt to alert us. To try to solve a problem. Not necessarily a recent problem, it can be a problem that we have experienced for years. You dreamed something disturbing? A rather curious one. You want to share it? I dreamed that you killed my dad in the bathroom. You buried a knife in him. In a dream... Were you there? More or less. I was the shampoo. Shampoo. Synchronicity. A few quick ideas about this... That you are on the threshold of becoming a man and ceasing to be a child. It was appropriate to kill your father to become the man of the house but, fate beat you to it. And now you feel guilty about your own desires. About killing you father because you wished him dead. You killed your father and yet... Your mother is still not for just you. And making me the architect of your father's death... It takes the blame off you. What? Your psyche is adjusting adjusting to your new situation. And that can be very distressing. These may help change your perspective. One in the morning. Another at night. If my dad hadn't died and they went through with the divorce, who would you have stayed with? I would have stayed with you. Whatever you did. Who were you talking to this afternoon that made you upset? Things of the past. It's my daughter. You're a mother? You're a dad. Yes. How old is your daughter? Eighteen. But I haven't seen her since she was four months old. You're a deadbeat dad? Yes. But... I have always sent her almost everything I earn. And now she's got it in her head that she wants to meet me. You don't want to see her? And so... Can you imagine. Having a dad like me? I imagine you as a good mom. Maybe she's cool? He's a weird guy, no? My mom's lover? Well... Technically he was her lover. Now he is her boyfriend. It's comfy here. If I could I wouldn't move either. What's this? My mom's boyfriend gave them to me. Why? Probably to make me stupid while he bangs my mom. Did you take one? I'm going to take them away, ok? Reality is thick like Jell-O. The consistency of a thick Latina. And there are a lot of people willing to swallow that shit. It disgusts me. Whose shit idea was it to give him anxiolytics? He's an idiot Lily! Tell me that it won't happen again. Or I'll kill him. Another reason for the tremendous downfall of our society, is the the loss of rituals. It is clear that I am not literally going to war. But sharpening this knife, I prepare to fight for what is mine. Even if my war is on the terrain of ideas and thought. You gave anxiolytics to Oliverio? We are in session. Don't you think of ever medicating my son again! You asked me for help, it was a professional decision. Oliverio needs a father figure, not a fucking pharmacy! Newton's third law. Of action and reaction. To properly understand this law. It must be taken into account that the force that produces the action acts on a body. The reaction force acts on another. They never act on the same body but are a couple of forces that act on different bodies. Due to the escape of gases through the lower opening of the combustion chamber of a rocket action is produced by the push necessary for its ascent: reaction. Ok, now light it. Do you want to do it? I can't. Why are you wearing a get-up? I look ridiculous, don't I? You look like a weird man. I am a weird man. You're going to meet her so she can see the real you. Not someone who doesn't even exist. You look weird because you feel weird. This is not you. Can I tell you something and you won't get mad? What? Sure? Stop it, what? You stink. How long since you've had a shower? Get in the water. The chlorine will help. We're alone. I'm not going to tell anyone. Come in! No one wants to talk about it. They're scared because nobody really knows what happens. Sometimes I feel him inside me. When I make a gesture, a movement... When I say something in a certain way. I feel like he's the one actually doing it. But it's not him... It's me, acting like him. Replicating something of his. It's very strange. Because I didn't realize these things until now. You'll see how that will eventually fade away. At any moment you'll start thinking about the silly things like before. I know the stories they tell about him, but if I try to remember, my only thoughts are from photographs. You should see the photos of my dad. The ones he takes. Used to take. He photographed furniture. Best furniture photographer in the world. One of the best. How cool! Come on, show me. How weird to be able to smell someone who doesn't exist. My mom wrote it about my dad. EMOTIONAL PARAPLEGIA Have you seen these? They're all of me asleep. Did you know about these photos? It is super sweet. Martha. I'm you dad. What if something worse happens to you? It turns out that if there is reincarnation. And you get to be... An earthworm. Being an earthworm Being an earthworm would make me want to squirm. I could be a koala. Being a koala, is not such a bad idea. Being an earthworm. Being an earthworm, would make me want to squirm. If you look at it with perspective we didn't have bad luck... How come? I'm leaving Sunday night. Is there anything you want to do before I go? You're still here? I thought you had already gone. I was about to. Have a good night. Do you want a drink? No thanks. I have a dinner date with... Oh come on, have a drink. We haven't talked since you arrived. Ok. You have a beer? Do you want a glass? No, this is fine. Salud. Salud. Oh sorry, you better go. Sorry. Ok. Ciao. Sorry. Your pool filter works. There's no shit in here. Or... Are you constipated? Get changed and let's go. You know I don't move from here. I heard you take romantic walks with your girlfriend. I do not have a girlfriend. Mariana? Mariana is not my girlfriend. And I wouldn't have to move from here to fuck her. You're an idiot. You're both idiots. Oli! Oli! Take. You'll be ok. I have to go out. I will not be long. You need something? You'll be alone. I cannot understand this as an act of evil. Hiding your perversity and egomania in the name of Motherhood? Give me a break! Go and get what you came for! I am sorry. I told you it was a loan. Good luck with your life. Lily... Everything was fine, I don't understand. It is not so difficult to understand that at this moment my only priority is Oliverio. I understand your responsibilities as a mother but... Arnold... There is no need to start. Please leave now. Sorry. I'm sorry about everything. I did it all wrong. Do you want pancakes? Hello. Good morning! There's coffee. Yes. Hi. It's so good to have you back. How did it go? Good. How is your daughter? She's perfect. She's beautiful! She wants to meet you. Is it alright if she visits one of these weekends? Of course this is your house. Okay. You'll tell me everything later. You're going to school? Something like that. Mariana! Mariana. Mariana. Sorry. I fucked up. What happened to your nose? Well... remember that bee you saved? Rosita. Help me put this on the other side.
