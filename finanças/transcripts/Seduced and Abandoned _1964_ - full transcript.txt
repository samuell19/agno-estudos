Let me sing you a tale of a family. The Ascalones, so stern and austere. You'll be tempted to call me a liar. But to the truth I swear I'll adhere. The once-proud Ascalone family. Found itself in a state of disgrace. For Matilda's fianc? Peppino. Took her sister in lustful embrace. Poor Agnese aflame with remorse. Makes a visit to the local priest. To confess her grave sin before God. From her guilt to be released. What are you studying? Pascoli. "All alone and famished, wandering on a steep hill, thorns tearing at my flesh..." "Crying, yes, perhaps... but softly." Where's Consolata? She went out to get the laundry. Agnese... why are you afraid? What are you making me do! Who's there? Come. Don't make a sound. Wicked girl, you gave in! I'm ashamed and disgusted with myself. You weren't disgusted in the throes of lust! I was right afterwards, Father. Too late, you shameless girl. What can I do? - Never see him again! - But how? He's always at my house. Every time I see him, I melt. Don't look at him! I try, but I can't help it. Shame on you! You must triumph over the devil. Pray. Mortify the flesh. Pray! Pray! Pray! You're so pale, miss. Are you ill? Let me carry those books. "Today was another day of rigorous instruction. In assembly of my musket I distinguished myself in ability and keen recall... for which I received special rations: Rigatoni in a delicious tomato sauce, and a fig marmalade that has brought on the usual reaction tonight: Intense itching that won't let me sleep. I've therefore directed my thoughts to you." Your fianc? is a man of letters. A poetic soul. I've rarely read such nonsense. Here, take it. Just a minute. "I plant fervent kisses on your lips." You tell that lecher to save this filth for his own sisters! One more trick like that and his letters go right in the toilet! - Vincenzo! - You shut up! Pansy! - Consolata, the door. - I'm going. I'll go. It's Peppino. Good evening, Matilde. Peppino, is that you? Come in! Don't we look sharp! I took the liberty of bringing a small gift. Chocolates! Matilde, you open them. You shouldn't have. - Peppino, sit down. Get some liqueur for your fianc?. Sit down. Give him some of the new stuff. It turned out well. Fermented all last year. Agnese! What is it, you nitwit? Forgive me. I don't feel well. Where's she going? What's wrong with Agnese? She's been acting strange. Must be too much studying. She talks in her sleep. In her sleep? What does she say? How should I know? It's just mumbling. What's this foolishness? A touch of fever, perhaps. I'll give her lettuce water in the morning. No, I won't. Be brave. Stand your ground. If you run, the devil's got you. Any news from Rome? Not yet. I sent in the application for the exam over a month ago. I'm waiting for news from my relative at the ministry office. You better be well prepared. Everyone wants that post of vice commissioner. Well, I happen to have the support of my uncle, who's the monsignor in Regalbuto. My cousin the lawyer will put in a word when the time comes. He's a friend of Judge Randazzo's brother. The one who couldn't get me out of military service. Shut up, idiot! Mama, have a chocolate. Me too. Grandpa, be good. Milk chocolate! Just one for your sister. - I feel better. - Thank goodness. I must say, the idea of living in Rome, far from Mama and Papa, worries me. You get used to anything. Have one. Peppino brought them. - Have one. - Just one. Pick them up. That one too. Don't move. Get out of here! What a madhouse. I don't know what it is. She was so good all day. What is it? Peppino has to be going. Already? I hope it wasn't - No, I have to memorize some chapters on forensic medicine. May I show him out? Go ahead. Hey, the glass. Three minutes. Consolata, where's that coffee? Peppino, do you love me? Very much. But I have to go now. So quickly? It hasn't even been half a minute. I know... but my studies have me worried. Besides, I've got a headache, and a full night of study ahead. I'll read something in bed too. That way I'll feel closer to you. Good night now. Will you come by tomorrow? I hope to. I don't know. Maybe the day after. I have to study. Don't wear yourself out. Be tough! Nerves of steel! I screwed up. But Agnese won't talk. She's not crazy. Crazy! What if she's crazy? God, if only I believed in prayer! Who are you? Not gonna answer? Are you a man? Or a rotten coward? Who are you? Who are you talking to? Who's in there? I'm studying out loud! You've been locked in there for days. Take a break. Come out for some fresh air. You make me sick. Mama, can you lend me 5,000 lire? - A vision! - Hold me back! Are they the ones from last month? Two are from last time. I don't recognize the third. They can change the locomotive but not the caboose! And what a caboose! A famous clinic claims that over the course of a man's lifetime, he has 3,000 loads to shoot. Not bad, eh? If you ask me, that clinic's crazy. We reserved three rooms. Welcome back. Ladies... may we offer you a drink? Very kind of you. - After they've freshened up, right? - Of course. See you soon. As I was saying, that clinic is crazy. And why is that? Because a real man shoots a load at least once a day from 18 until 60. If you'll accept simple math - - Are they here? - Yes. - He's not here yet! - Who? Professor Schiavone is bringing me notes for the civil service exam. It seems there are actually 12 positions, not 10, so my chances are greater. Great. Listen, why don't we see you at the house anymore? Like I told Matilde, I'm studying for the exam. Sixteen hours a day! In fact, I'm on my way home now. If Professor Schiavone arrives, tell him I'll stop by again. My respects, Don Vincenzo. Go on now. As I was saying, if you accept simple math as proof, 60 - 18 = 42. And 42 times 365 comes to - - What are you doing, girls? - We're in the bathroom. You're always in there. Agnese! - I'm right here. Keep embroidering. Rosaura. I'm coming! Come on. Get to work. Matilde, when will your trousseau be finished? I can't find Peppino's picture anywhere. His student picture. - What is it? - I pricked myself. Careful. You'll get blood on it. I don't feel well. She does look pale, doesn't she? Yes, a bit. - She's white. - Almost green. You haven't been eating. Shall I fix you some eggs? No, nothing. Leave me alone. You have to make an effort. Look at your sisters. Look how nice and fat Matilde is. You're spindly as a spider. That's just how I am! Mama, Peppino hasn't been here in almost a week. He's studying. It's for your future. He could at least stop by now and then. What's wrong with her? Rosaura, go and see. She doesn't talk in her sleep. She prays. What's that? She tosses and turns all night. Mother of God! She's locked inside. "Matilde mustn't suffer on my account. Please come back, Peppino. I'll never reveal the shameful secret of how I gave in to lust. Good-bye... and pay no heed if this letter is stained with tears." Agnese, what are you doing? What are you doing in there? I'm coming. - What were you doing? - My stomach was a bit upset. "The shameful secret of how I gave in to lust..." Francesca, I'm home. Rosaura's on the 20th, Matilde's the 25th, Agnese's the 27th. What day is today? July 31. Do you need something, ma'am? Vincenzo. Do you know what "lust" means? "To give in to lust." Right now? No, that's what Agnese wrote in a letter. To whom? I don't know. I'm worried about that girl. What's she up to? She's doing penance. Come in quietly. Three hours by car! Don't you have a midwife around here? Is she ready? - Just a minute. Wait. Papa, I spent 3,000 lire on gas. Go on. Annina. Be a good girl for Mama. Out! It's nothing. - What do you want? - Close the door! Inside, all of you! No, don't! She's a girl. It had to happen sooner or later. Who was it? It's not true! I don't know a thing! I didn't do anything! Who was it? Stop it, Vincenzo! She could be pregnant! The midwife couldn't be sure. We have to have her urine analyzed. Stop right there! Examine all three of them! MEDICAL LABORATORY Can I help you? This is my wife's. A urine sample? Yes, my wife's. General analysis? To confirm a possible pregnancy. Name? - What? - Your name? Pisciotta. It'll take a few days. That long? Listen... my cousin is Judge Randazzo's brother's lawyer. That's a different story. Have a seat. We'll do it right away. With today's new tests, we'll have an answer in 30 minutes. Like a telegram! Mr. Pisciotta. Everything's okay. The test was positive. Congratulations to you and your wife. Who was it? Where? When? She's never alone. Was it at school? Then who? A friend of the family? The doctor? Impossible. Father Mariano? Forgive me. Then where was it? At home? Peppino? No. Antonio? What am I saying? Who's there? Where's Peppino? I don't know. He must have left. I fell asleep. These animals! - Move! - But Papa - Quiet, you slut! It's not true! Don't deny it, you tramp! Was it him? Matilde will hear you! Shut up! I'll kill him! No, I'll kill myself first! Out of the way! I'll become a nun! Enough blasphemy! You're a whore, not a nun! You'll never leave this room again! Let her out only to use the toilet! Out of the way! All you ever do is sleep! Papa, I'll confess! It wasn't him! It wasn't him! It was a policeman passing through who stole my honor. It wasn't him! Ignazia, the door! Don't try to get away! Out of my way! Write! "Dear Matilde..." No! Just "Matilde." Have you gone mad? Has something happened to Matilde? What is it? He got her pregnant. A traitor twice over! If you don't marry her, I'll stab you! You scoundrel! I'm a father too. Calm down. We'll make things right. Let me go! I'll give you two weeks! Now write! Poor Matilde! Her reputation will be ruined! I'm thinking of her, not myself. I'll take care of Matilde! Write! "Matilde..." Comma. "I take back my promise of marriage." Period. Why? What did I do? Out of the blue, with no explanation! "Don't ask the reason for my decision." But why? - Calm down. So Agnese has no shame. What's that got to do with me? Calm down! My reputation's ruined! They'll all point and laugh! I'll never leave the house again! Your father won't let you die an old maid. It's all that wretched girl's fault! That's enough now. It's all your fault! You let a policeman steal your honor. Where's the baron? Inside. - The baron's hanging himself! - Come and see! - Baron! - Who's that? May I? Wait! Just a minute. I'm coming. May I come in? Am I disturbing you? Just a moment! Baron, you're looking well. Forgive me. I was just passing by. You know how it is. I said to myself, "Let's pay the baron a visit." Big place, isn't it? Spacious. It's all I have left of the house. It's all been rented out room by room, like a low-class hotel. This is my last refuge. Forgive me. Have I put you in an awkward situation? Don't worry. A gentleman's dignity blossoms in adversity. Let's go into the antechamber. In any case, I can still say I have running water and a chair for my guests. Make yourself comfortable. But how did - If I may ask, how did you come - I inherited holes in my pocket from my father. Ah, your father. The esteemed Baron Riprando. I remember him with loving devotion. It was he who loaned me money to buy the mine, which I promptly paid back. That was in 1930. You wouldn't remember. You were just a baby. See his portrait? It hung there. It was the last thing I sold. He was an ugly man, but the portrait was valuable. He wasn't that ugly. One eye went this way, and the other, that way. But he was a very kind man. Coming out of mass, he'd give my children sweets, candies, ice cream. He was fond of my children. Do you remember them? Rosaura... Annina, Matilde. This is Matilde, Rosaura, Annina, and that's Antonio. You're a lucky father, with a garland of such beautiful flowers. It's the florist who deserves the credit. Matilde, do the honors. Please. Have a seat. - Who's that? - A baron. Who's here? The baron from the big black house. Why's he here? I think he's to be Matilde's new fianc?. You can see it in Don Vincenzo's eyes. Poor Matilde. Peppino was better. If Matilde marries the baron, that means - Nothing. My handsome man! What a heavenly aroma! You put wild fennel in it. Sublime! You must forgive us for starting with such a heavy dish. - A wonderful idea! - My husband's. He said to me, "Make something hearty, because the baron's -." Matilde made the pasta herself. My compliments! You made this yourself? Personally I prefer it to a maccherone di zita or even a flato co'lu pertuso. You're quite a connoisseur. Just a man who appreciates good cooking. What's the next course? Since today is the feast day of Saint John - You made snails! How did you guess? From the exquisite aroma in the air. What's that saying? "Snails to eat... a girl so sweet - an inexhaustible treat!" Nice, isn't he? A real gentleman. Too bad about his teeth. It's causing quite a stir. My respects. They look good together. - Yes. We can tell Matilde the whole truth now... but tactfully. - Not yet. - Why not? His teeth. He's missing three. - Yes, it's easy to see. - And smell. Matilde says his breath is foul. - I'll talk to him. - But tactfully. - Don't worry. Let's leave the women to themselves. Go on, Matilde. Let's have ourselves a little chat. Baron, what dentist do you go to? You noticed, huh? When I laugh, everyone can see. Too bad. You're a young man. At my age, they don't grow back. Believe me. Don't worry. There's always a solution. Do you know Dr. Patern?? He's the best around. Yes, but I can't - - I'll speak to him. - That's too much trouble! Go on, Matilde. Don Orlando, remember our agreement. - Now it's up to us. - Don't worry. Where's Peppino? He's sick. Sick? He's wearing horns! I don't want Agnese. - What? - What's that? I want a virgin for a wife. Why should I give up that right? But you saw Don Vincenzo. Answer me this: In all honesty, would you have married Mama if she'd done what Agnese did with me? What's that got to do with it? You tried to get me to. So? It's a man's right to ask, a woman's duty to refuse. Exactly! Agnese didn't refuse, did she? I won't marry that whore! I gave Don Vincenzo my word! You didn't answer his question. If I'd given in, would you have married me? Certainly not! You gonna move that cart or not? Nino, when's the explosion? Carmelo, the mine! Move it, you freeloaders! If the Califanos don't show today, there'll be hell to pay! Who's that? It's Father Mariano. Father Mariano! What brings you here? - How are things? - We're getting by. I didn't just happen by. There's something weighing heavily on my heart. Can you guess? Maybe I can, but why not just tell me? Amalia Califano came to see me. She told me everything. Amalia Califano is an intelligent woman. She's charming, very religious, and very prudent. Charming. Right. Matrimony is no way to right a wrong, my friend. A wrong has been done. Fine. But you don't set it right by committing a bigger wrong, forcing two people to marry where there's no guarantee of union, stability and affection. Eretis animae duo in corpore uno. Let's not forget that. Absolutely not. And what guarantee could such a union offer for the upbringing of the children? Peppino Califano is a rotten scoundrel, but in the church's eyes, he's not obligated to marry Agnese. He's not obligated... in the church's eyes. - Precisely. But we all agreed! No, Amalia Califano agrees with me on this point. As does Peppino. Those filthy dogs! Don Vincenzo, calm down! Where are you going? Stop! - Are the Califanos home? - No, nobody. Nobody, huh? I just scrubbed the floor! Don Vincenzo, no one's home! - Where are they? - I don't know. Stop! Brass, emphasize that third measure. More hatred! Take it again from G. - Where's your son? - He had to leave suddenly. And your wife too? You gave your word. I swear, this was my wife's idea. I'm not involved. Not involved? Are you a man or a puppet? You gave me your word, and you'll keep it! What's going on? Nothing. Nothing at all. - A little misunderstanding. - Surmountable, I hope. Very surmountable. You tramp! It's not my fault Peppino ran off! - Shut up! - Quiet! The baron's here! Shut up! Wake up! - The dentist took a mold. - Great. - But no estimate yet. - We'll work it out. Take this. I put in a change of socks, and the cheese our cousin's so fond of. Rotten coward! I hope your tongue shrivels up and your teeth fall out! Don Vincenzo, beyond consolation. Tormented and achingly sad. When he learns of the things that have happened. It practically drives the man mad. Ascalone, whipped into a fury. In such haste that his nerves are rubbed raw. Madly rushes to seek the opinion. Of his cousin, attorney-at-law. Come in, cousin. Is the family well? The wife, Antonio, all the girls? Everyone's fine. Glad to hear it. So what brings you here? Something serious? Tumor? Honor. Eat and drink while you still can. I'm a miserable wreck. My gall bladder's swollen up, and I can't sleep at night. You're lucky to be young and happy. Winter's returning, and my rheumatism with it, and my heart's in bad shape. The doctor says it's blood pressure. I'm constipated. I'm constipated! What can I do? A friend tells me to take India root. Vincenzo, you know a lot. Will India root help? Who knows? Carmela, the door! We'll send this Peppino a registered letter. If he doesn't appear in 24 hours, we'll press charges per Article 530: Corruption of a minor. Only marrying her will save him from jail. Article 544. But he knows you'd never do that. Am I right, cousin? You don't want everyone to know the truth. - No, never! Exactly. I'd feel the same way. So what's left? I'll kill him! You'll get 20 years. If you'd done that the moment you learned of all this, overcome by anger at the offense to your honor, you'd have gotten three to seven years. It has to be in the heat of passion. It's too late now. Your fight with Orlando Califano demonstrates premeditation: 20 years. Goddamn it. Unless... another family member who so far has made no threats suddenly discovers this offense to your honor and takes revenge by killing him! But who could that be? Let's count out Francesca and your father. Agnese is obviously out. She couldn't logically suddenly discover now that her honor's been compromised. One name leaps out from the brief list of candidates. Me? I don't get it. I was talking to him about a very important matter when that lump suddenly grew on his nose. He shook with fever and practically passed out. Almost 104. It's rare, but it can happen. I had a similar case in '43 in Naples. We called it "shell shock." A good laxative and he'll be fine. Couldn't you try something a bit stronger? A little penicillin? Why not? Penicillin. One million units. - Could you make it two? - Very well. Two million. A laxative... Eternal Father grant me your counsel. Dear Don Vincenzo, to what do I owe the pleasure? Or should I say the displeasure? Don't worry. My family's fine. Thank goodness. What can I do for you? Excuse me? Where is he? Dear Vincenzo, times are hard. You just can't please anybody. Look here. I'm perfecting an electric guitar with portable battery for serenading. But who serenades anymore? Today they send the girl a record. And does anyone today care about putting a good face on death? Today the rich buy refrigerators and televisions, but they choose caskets made of common wood. In short, business is rough. I have to be everyone's friend. You know how people in this town are. You could receive an anonymous letter. This should cover the stamps. "The party you seek is hidden under his uncle's cassock in Regalbuto. An anonymous friend, ever at your service." Perfect. Here. A gun license. Unassailable. Don't forget: You always carry the gun on you for payroll disputes and such. And when you approach Peppino, give him an ultimatum: "Will you marry my sister?" If he does, great. If he doesn't... plug him! Forgive me. I brought coffee. - Thank you, cousin. - How many? We'll do it. As I was saying, empty the whole cartridge, but make sure just one bullet deals the fatal blow. You fired wildly, in a blind rage, and one bullet dealt the fatal and tragic blow. That's what I need in court. Hear that? That way you get five years maximum. - Great. Let's get going. The train might just be on time. Here. Excuse me. I'll be right back. Hurry up! It's occupied. I know that. Matilde, it's me. Tell me honestly: Do you still love Peppino? What? If Peppino were to die, would you be sorry? If Peppino died and your brother went to jail? How should I interpret your silence? Silent approval - is that it? You trying to be funny? Well, it's in very bad taste. Besides, why would Peppino go and die? I'm coming! What do I do? Would you be sorry if Peppino died and your brother went to jail? Peppino's at his uncle's in Regalbuto. You don't want me to kill a man you loved, do you? Tear the dirty coward's eyes out! What was that? I'm coming! Get in. What is it? I have to use the bathroom. Consolata. Open the door. What are you doing there? Me? Nothing. What do you think? No one saw you. Come in. Bisicato... open the door. Come in. What did you want to tell me? Nothing. Why would I have anything to tell you? Aren't you Vincenzo Ascalone's daughter? Annina? No, Agnese. What are you staring at? Sit! You sit too. Now what's going on? One man's gonna kill another man. Could we be more specific? - I can't. - Call her father. - No, you mustn't! - Then talk. My brother intends to kill Peppino Califano. Where? He's hiding at the convent of St. Giuliano in Regalbuto. Antonio left five minutes ago. - How? On the train. Then there's time. But why does your brother want to kill him? Wasn't he engaged to your older sister? Didn't she leave him? He should be the one to take offense. So why does Antonio want to kill him? Because Peppino's a rotten coward! Listen, little girl... why try to save his life and then call him a rotten coward? You sure nothing went on between you two? What are you doing? She says no and you put no? You think we're in Treviso? This is Sicily. "No" could mean "yes." I say something went on between you two. - No, God strike me blind! - Call her father. No, please! It's like you said. - Just as I thought. Now you can type. How old are you? - Almost 16. - A minor. I'll need your signature. How far did we get? "Are you Annina?" She answers, "No, Agnese." Period. Get up. Go get the car ready. - Where are we going? - We're looking for the convent. Go around the plaza. - Let's ask these men. - Go around. - Let's ask first. Where's the convent of St. Giuliano? The convent of St. Giuliano. They're not answering. No, Bisicato. They're not answering. Now go. Where are you going? What are you doing? Stop! Excuse me, Father. Stop, coward! What's going on? Stop! Stop! I order you to stop! I'll shoot! Damn you! Sergeant, what in the world are you doing here? Whore! Bastard child! Spy! Quiet! Don't make things worse! It's nothing. Calm down, cousin. Murderers! Speak up! No, don't speak up. In fact, better not to speak at all. I agree with my colleague. Let's set rancor aside and button our lips. Nothing happened. Remember: You have but one enemy, and he's in there! Is that clear? Excuse me. JUDGE - Excuse me. - Hold on - - Send them in. - Yes, sir. Come on. Good day, Your Honor. Put out the cigarette. Move over. Sit down. Antonio Ascalone. According to your sister, you meant to kill Giuseppe Califano. Me? Agnese, have you gone crazy? Sit down! Your Honor, I swear. May God strike me dead! Magnificent! He's denying everything! Now it's Peppino's turn. - Let me see. It says here that you fled, with Ascalone in pursuit. I wasn't fleeing. I was just running. Me too. They were just running. - We were just running. - Into the garden. - And the gun? - Did I have a gun? Heavens no. The gun was on the ground. Whose gun is it? With all the guns on the ground these days - Besides, Your Honor, why would I want to kill Peppino? We're the best of friends. Right? I'll tell you the motive. I have here a charge of corrupting a minor - No! Your Honor, they're slandering my family's good name! My daughter's virginity is unassailable! That document isn't valid. I'll press defamation charges. Control yourself. This is a hall of justice. There's too many people in here! If you value your life, you won't say a word! Threatening a public official. Shall I arrest him? Let's not be so dramatic. Very well. Your Honor... we're not millionaires or barons. Our only treasure is our good name. The court is bound to strict secrecy at this stage. Calm down. No more outbursts! - Don't push! - Outside, please. Let them stay. Perhaps we can simplify matters. And you go sit with the others. - Sit down. - And keep quiet, please. Now, let's try to simplify matters. Don't push. It was him. Have a seat, Agnese. Do you confirm the charges? Your Honor, it was just a whim of the moment. She's a little girl. Right, sweetie? It was a joke. Tell the judge. She's a virgin through and through! Bringing false charges is a serious crime, punishable by prison. Answer. Sergeant, call the medical officer. An exam will tell if these charges are true. You don't object, do you? Why would I? Do you, ma'am? - And you? - Heavens, no. You neither? What about you, Agnese? No, I won't let you! I've already been examined! - That's a lie! - Wait, Sergeant. - I didn't move. We're wasting time on an hysterical girl! Are you a virgin or not? Answer! Answer! He knows what happened that day! - Me? - Yes, you! Tell him if I'm a virgin! If you're not, what's that got to do with me? Why does that mean it was me? Your Honor, I swear - Enough! Your Honor, mine is an old and honorable family that's never been forced to turn to the law. Yes, we've had our share of violent deaths, but we don't turn to the law, because we have our dignity. But at this point I must confirm that my unfortunate daughter was manhandled by this pig! We can produce witnesses, the first being the priest. Your Honor, I knew nothing about this! Write that down! And I have a fever too. So much for simplifying matters. Attack her character. Remember: Whore! Counselor, what are you doing? Not you, him! Excuse me, Your Honor. Show she was already corrupted or you're in trouble. Counselor. Your Honor, my client would like to recount how this supposed seduction came about. Clerk, get your pen ready. Very well. Step forward. Let's hear it. I'd been visiting the Ascalone residence for some time, as it's the home of my ex-fianc?e, Miss Matilde. I'd had occasion to notice certain behavior, certain inviting glances from this young lady, but I discouraged these unwelcome advances. That's not true! Silence! Get to the point. - Of course. On July 12th I was invited for a meal. - In the morning? - No, at 1:30. Then say "lunch"! Very well. Lunch. After eating, everyone took a nap. I stayed in the living room with Miss Matilde and her sister, whom you see here. What, you smoke now? I didn't know that. What are you reading? I'm thirsty. Excuse me. What are you doing? Are you crazy? What are you doing? What are you trying to do to me? Peppino, I want you! I'm engaged! That's enough! Agnese, what's wrong? Take her outside. Did you get all that? Be prepared to repeat that verbatim in court. - You mean the charges stand? - Arrest him! Idiot! I request he be released on bail. Your client is under arrest for now. You may all go now. Good day, Your Honor. - Antonio Ascalone. - Your Honor? You're charged with armed assault and released without bail. - Shall I close the door? - Yes. Start laughing, all of you, or I'll break your necks! Good day, my friends. Agnese, would you like some ice cream? I know how much you like it. Good day, gentlemen. Would you like some too? Five lemon popsicles. My little beauty! Take this. I'd like pistachio. I wanted pistachio. Not bad. I hope they didn't put crap in it. Professor, you again! Dear friend, may I ask you something? Is it true Antonio and Peppino got in a fight? I swear, you can't keep a secret in this town. It's true. Matilde was tired of Peppino, but he got the idea we opposed their engagement. - Isn't that true? - What, are we in the dark ages? Matilde didn't like him, and that was that. You can't tell the heart what to do! Good day to you all. Filthy tramp! Spy! Come here! Papa, calm down! Out of my way, you pathetic coward! I did my duty! Matilde is here! Quiet! You're never coming out again, even to use the toilet! Yes, sweetheart. I know what you're up to, trying to force Peppino to marry me. But it's too late. If that traitor doesn't want me, he doesn't deserve me. But thank you anyway. You too, brother. It's the baron! Rizieri, I'm coming! The law is very clear. Article 544. All your offenses, listed in Article 530 - rape, corruption of a minor, etc. - are nullified by marriage to the offended party. In short: He has to marry her. I won't do it! Better jail than marrying that tramp! Don't try the same story on us that you gave the judge. Even he didn't fall for it. You seduced her! So if I marry her, she's suddenly pure again? Nice logic! With a criminal record, you can't take the exam for the position in Rome. Damn it! Be brave, my beautiful baby. The lawyer got you released. On bail, that is. You're crucifying me. You're crucifying me! My little boy! - There she is! - Bring her here! Peppino Califano, do you consent to marry this whore? I declare you man and wife! Man and wife! Everything's okay! Cousin! Article 530 states that corruption of a minor - The Califanos. Papa, they're coming. I want them publicly humiliated! My jacket! Before the whole town! What do they want from me? I don't want Peppino anymore. I'm not some rag they can toss aside, then pick up again. We're giving that rotten blackmailer satisfaction. Stay calm. Don Vincenzo, if I may - Did you come to see me? Sorry. I'm very busy. We had a long talk with Peppino. He's willing to - - What? - Marry Agnese. What an honor! But too convenient, and too easy. Too convenient, too easy and too simple! And I could go on! Why are you acting so odd? This is no time for grudges. We're all up to our necks here. Why am I acting so odd? Tell me: Why should I give Agnese to your son? Because in eight months. Agnese will have a baby. The fact is, otherwise your son goes to jail. This matter ended up in court against my wishes, and our prospect now is a jailhouse wedding. I can see it now: "Convict to marry whore." No! Agnese won't be called a whore, and that's final! Agnese doesn't need this marriage because she's pure as the driven snow. I therefore refuse! Of course, you can always try to change my mind. I can't stop you from trying, so - - So? - Go on and try. But loudly, so everyone can hear! But mind you, I won't be easily persuaded. I'll be tough as nails. Impervious... almost. You've pushed me too far! I won't give Agnese to your son! Do I have to spell it out? Mother of God, they can be annoying! What's going on, Don Vincenzo? It's pure madness! Can you believe that Peppino? Filippo, an anise on ice. He's saying we're standing in his way. - How's that? Since he can't have Matilde, he's decided he wants to marry Rosaura - I mean what's-her-name - Agnese. - That's absurd! - First Matilde and now Agnese? That's right. His parents told me he's "infatuated" with her! Besides the fact Agnese is 16 and probably wants nothing to do with him, would I give her to a man like that? Well, Sergeant? My friends, I implore you: Not a word to anyone. Good day, Sergeant. - Careful you don't really shoot him. - Do I look like an idiot? What's come between us. Tell me why. O my love. More passion! This is pathetic! Vincenzo, hurry. Let him finish the refrain. I want the whole town to hear. Does a man's heart mean so little. Giuseppe Califano, you'll never marry my daughter! Never! What's going on? Quiet, you tramp! Peppino's come back! Forgive him! Maybe he really does love me. He still loves me! Back to bed, all of you! Matilde's to leave tomorrow with Grandpa to see her Aunt Carmela who's very ill, understand? She can come back when everything's been worked out. Be good, Papa. Bye, Matilde. Write us with good news. Stop, stop! - I'll be on my way. - Go ahead. - Don Vincenzo, I have something to say. - I'm all ears. I know you sent Matilde away due to Peppino's dubious behavior. And you did the right thing. But shouldn't I be the one to confront this fellow and explain that he has no right - Baron, the Califanos don't merit your concern. They got what they deserved last night. The whole town was laughing! Hey, did I just see a big smile? May I? Beautiful! They look like your own. - Not quite yet. - Do you have the estimate? Worse. The bill. - May I? - You have every right. I'll read it later, Rizieri. May I call you that? Of course... Papa. May I call you Papa? Of course! You must come to dinner tonight. - I don't want to impose. Lasagna and sardines! I'll be there at 8:30... Papa. Goddamn it! Excuse me. A wonderful day to you. My dear sergeant... to what do I owe the displeasure of your visit? Pasquale Profumo, I'll be brief. I saw them come and go. You tell me the rest. Sergeant, that's a professional secret. What a place! Better! Much better! Or maybe an atomic bomb. - Get the jeep. We're leaving. - Yes, sir. But I don't understand. - No need to. Just follow me. - Too bad. There's a procession today. - There's a kidnapping today. - A kidnapping? - A girl. Move it, you idiot! Agnese, where are you? - I thought it was Papa. - Get dressed. We're going out, with Papa's permission. - Going out? - Yes. It's St. Liborio's day. We need a good mass. But bathe first! Where should I put these? Son of a bitch. You coming, Bisicato? - Isn't there a kidnapping? - Precisely. Where? I don't see anyone. - It's taking place in town. Sit down. Better yet, lie down. - What are you thinking? - Nothing. You are! Stop it! - It's clouding over. - It should rain salt! Tell me. He's kidnapping the girl today. What would you do? Arrest him immediately. Great! So he can marry her tomorrow and go scot-free, while you look like a fool. Get it through your head: Marriage nullifies it all: Kidnapping, rape, corruption of a minor. It's all in Article 544. Marriage wipes the slate clean. Better than an amnesty. You didn't know? Kids around here learn it with their catechism. - Why not just marry her? - He doesn't want her. - Then why kidnap her? - So he's forced to marry her. They're all in on it. - But not him? Yes, he's in on it too. With all due respect, sir, I don't understand. You can't, Bisicato. It's a question of honor. It's always a question of honor. It should rain salt and dry everything up! Immacolata, get inside! - Agnese, walk on this side. - Why? Annina's shorter. She should be on the left. I've never heard of that. And she was on the left! Let me go! What do you want? Mama! Not her! Her! Go! Get in! Stop! Stop, murderers! My little Agnese! Stop them! You all saw it! It was that goddamned Peppino! Let me go! Stop it! Stop the car! Go on! Go back to town! I'd rather go to jail! Go on, you tramp! Get out of here! What's she doing? Did she stop? She's going back to town. How can she do that? She'll be disgraced in the eyes of the whole town. This can't be! Go back to town, you tramp! Everyone's waiting for you in the plaza! Even the dogs! Let everyone see your belly! Don't keep them waiting! Run! Here we go. Here comes the procession. What's going on? Move it! Can't you see there's a procession? Get out of here! Move your car, you jerk! We can go now. Don Vincenzo... I kiss your hand... and beg your forgiveness. Lift your head... so I can slap you first! Now kiss my hand. Now I forgive you. Come inside, you rascal. What are you all staring at? These things happen. My house is open to all my friends! Congratulations! Let's go. Back to your places. Cousin, may I? Greetings! Don Mariano! Wedding candies. A token of gratitude from the bride and groom. - Are they already married? - Not yet. Wedding banns will be announced tomorrow or the day after. Where's the copy of the letter? Wouldn't it be nice if all legal conflicts could be resolved so amicably? I'll say. Clerk. Good day, young man. So you intend to marry Miss Ascalone? Of course. Clerk, take all this down. Where's Miss Ascalone? Here she is. Come on. Here she is, Your Honor. Now then, young lady... do you agree? Are you happy to be marrying him? - Very happy! Young lady, do you wish to marry Giuseppe Califano? Agnese! Answer His Honor's question. Come on, sweetheart! Say something! Agnese, answer! Agnese, answer: Yes or no. Yes! Yes! She's crying for joy! They're tears of happiness! She said yes. You heard her yourself. Agnese, what will His Honor think? Enough! Everybody out! I'll kill you, you tramp! You won't kill anyone! You're charged with assault and exploitation of a minor! Write that down! Giuseppe Califano, you're still charged with corruption of a minor, and now with kidnapping per Article 522. Peppino's to be tried in court! - When? - In a few days. Closed courtroom! What does that mean? That the crimes are unmentionable. Venereal matters. - He doesn't want her. - No, she doesn't want him! - The motive's clear. - I don't understand. - He kidnapped her. - So? He kidnapped her, and she still doesn't want him? Peppino Califano is impotent! Let them by. You can tell she's a whore by how she walks! - Then what's he being tried for? - She's a minor and he's already had her. The kidnapping was a cover. I say the sisters are all alike. It's a whole family of whores! There they are! Leave me alone! Agnese, hurry up! Ascalone, I have to speak to you! Stop! This is too much. You owe me an explanation. We're all up to our necks in shit! Hands off, you bum! I may be a bum, but I'm a gentleman, and you can't buy me at any price! Bunch of Neanderthals! Stupid brutes! She's a whore! Take him inside! Inside, quick! - Happy now? - Did you like it? Stop her! Stop her! I want to get away from here! - Where? - I want to go to Milan! My daughter! I'll be a maid! - What about the baby? - Bastard! Son of a bitch! Why do you want to send me to jail? Peppino in jail! Evil demon, I drive you hence by all of nature's elements! No, I won't! I won't do it! Forgive me, Papa! Tramp! Whore. My dear Agnese. You're all better now, sweetheart. Come. She's better now. Congratulations, my child. Why are all these people here? What's Aunt Carmela doing here? - She's here for your father. Your cousins from Ragusa are here too, and your aunts, and cousins from Agrigento that you've never met. Come here, my beautiful baby. Let me thank you. Give me your hand. Give Papa your hand. Thank you. Come closer. Come here, Peppino. Give me your hand. Thank you, both of you. You idiot! The veil. It's lovely. - A dream. - A cloud of love. What are they doing? Agnese's almost ready. The ceremony's at 10:00. Try to relax. I'm not gonna make it. Come closer. I'm leaving you. I'm leaving you. What are you saying, for the love of God! I'm leaving you all, but don't let them know, or they'll call it off again and all will be lost. Don't tell them until afterwards. - Cousin... - Go now. Go. We can't leave him like this. Go! I'll rest. I'll sleep. Don't ruin it now. Don't tell them. Lock the door. Laugh! Laugh! It's a happy day! The happiest of days! Hurray! Maybe it's time we wrote to Matilde and told her the truth about everything. My poor daughter. Two pieces of bad news. Peppino's gotten married and the baron's left her. There's a third bit of bad news. - What? - Nothing. Take each other's right hand. Look, they're exchanging the symbols of eternal love. HONOR AND FAMILY
