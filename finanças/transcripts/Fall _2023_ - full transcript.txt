[moaning] [chickens clucking] Edmar! Edmar! Son of… Edmar! Edmar! Get up, now! We're already out of water, and you didn't bother to fetch some! [bed creaking] Hey! Answer me! Wait a second Hurry up! Fetch some water already! I still need to go to the market! [fly buzzing] [fly buzzing] Mom, it is still early! You are such a peculiar kid! Fetch some water already, please! I just need two buckets of water. - Go now! Make it fast! - On it! You are so stubborn! Edmar! What are you doing? I told you to hurry up, right? What now, Edmar? What is that? A rubber. I know, but what are you planning to do with that? - I will use it to tie... - What are you going to tie? Our hose. Why are you going to tie the hose? Water is not coming out of the hose, because there might be a leak. Why didn't you tell me that there is no water flowing? Did you even ask? You annoying kid! Do you want me to use this and tie it around your neck? So annoying. Start fetching some water please. I will. Fill up the drum and pail with water, and then fix the hose. - Are you listening? - Yes. You're just saying that! I told you many times, that once there is no water left, you must fetch some, remember? You must fill up the drum and pail, remember? Mom, it was raining last night. You are such a smart-ass! Go now! Alright! [sighs] We'll be kicked out of this place? Apparently. Because Ofelia is not giving our rental fees to Mrs. Gonzalo. What? Yeah. All our payments since last year were not delivered. Our debt to Mrs. Gonzalo is already around three million. Hey, it's 2.8 million. If we do not do something about it, all of our families will starve. Jesus Christ! She already disappeared! We got swindled. They said Ofelia Goja isn't her true name. We are so stupid! I told you from the start that I don't trust that woman. Look what happened to us? We were all fooled by her. Now what? We are doomed. Let's file a case. She's missing but we will still file a class suit. I will talk to Atty. Glenda right away You should sign already. We will sign too. Sign it now then I will make others do the same. I will be the OIC for the meantime. Do it now! I will sign it as well. You should sign too. We need everyone’s support. [chattering] Should I sign here? Your turn. Don’t be late in Barangay, okay? I will come back. My regular is already here. Hey, I'm sorry about the wait. [chattering] It's been a year since you last used the tricycle. Does it have any damage? Edmar. You need to start working. Sort yourself out! Okay? You are a good looking guy, you should not waste that. You are not getting any younger. You need to earn some money even just for your own sustainability. Save money so you could study. Life is hard nowadays, you need to finish a degree. A two year course would be enough to find a decent job. That is one thing I regret the most. When... I didn't prioritize my studies when I was in college. I was focused on my boyfriend because it feels good. I liked having one. But in the end, it was just nothing. That is why I want you to find a job. Because… With my limited earnings working in the market, we cannot sustain all of our daily expenses. We have to pay for electricity, water and food. Prices keep going up, and I'm having a hard time. Also... we have a problem in the market. Hey! Hey! Yes, Mom? Do you understand what I am saying? Did you hear all the things I said? What was that? Sorry I didn’t hear it. Dumbass! Your mind is floating again! That's because you're always jerking off! Annoying kid! Unbelievable. I don’t know where you get that stupidity. You are old enough already, so find a job! Where can I find one? Where? - You are so cute! - It hurts, Mom! Stop messing around, you're pissing me off! Oh my, Demetrio! You are such a cute kid! Just eat! [sighs] [moaning] [running water] Karisma! Karisma! I want to pee. [groaning] [groaning] [exhales] Can you get that? [groaning] [groaning] I will go to the market. So, are you going to the market? What should we eat later? Okay, let's have beef stew. Then buy some dessert, alpahor with mixed coconut milk. Also, buy efficascent oil and baby oil. What else? Lastly, my favorite, Alfonso! [laughing] I thought you said you'll stop drinking? Did you know that if I die, you will have everything that I have? This is too much. That's yours. I have a lot of money and I don’t know how I am going to spend it all. [sighs] I already did a lot of things in my life. I traveled to different countries. Of course, I achieved all of my dreams now. But you know what my ultimate dream is? None other than you! [chuckling] Come here! I don't want anything else. You are here. Don’t you want to be healed? Why? Don’t you believe that my dick can still do it? I have 11 inches, remember? We will get there. Back then, I was bedridden, but now I can stand. You will never know, I might walk again and fuck you. [laughing] For me, you are precious. Your palms, it heals me. Your lips, your body. Of course. Tell me what I should say next. Ask how it is. - What? - Ask how it is. Come on. Check my dick. It is still functioning. Are you sure? Last night, it did function. Check it out. [moaning] [laughing] Bad girl! [laughing] [moaning] [choking] [moaning] You are such a bad girl [laughing] [panting] Bad girl! Bad girl! Hurry up. Don’t forget the money The reason why I gathered you here is because I have good news and bad news, but I will announce first the good news. Now, we can already file an Estafa case against Ofelia Gojar. [cheering] The real name of Ofelia is Luzviminda Gawaran. We already went to the NBI to investigate her and I promise that she will be punished. We will bring it to the court to ensure that she will be caught. Thank you, we're so grateful for you, Attorney! May we now know the bad news? Right… If we don't settle the payment to Mrs. Gonzalo in one month, we can still be kicked out in the market. You know that we are paying, Attorney. We're paying! Yet, we can still be kicked out? Our income is low! - Yeah! - We are paying our monthly dues! But we got swindled, right? Ofelia is shameless. I hope she rots in prison! Yeah! She's been like that. She's a certified scammer. I understand where you are all coming from. That is why we will expedite the creation of a demand letter. We will submit a petition against Luzviminda Gawaran. Until when should we wait, Attorney? Here. All the people in the market already signed. Read it carefully. [crickets chirping] Edmar! Come here. Can you massage my head, shoulders, and neck? Okay mom. Just put pressure here, and there. - And put less oil. - Yes mom. Mom. How old are you? I'm 44, why? If dad was alive, how old would he be? Your dad was fifteen years older than me. - Fifteen? - Yes! Why did you fall for someone older than you? Just shut up and focus on what you’re doing. You’re making my head hurt. You know, when it comes to women. When their partner is younger, or of the same age. They’re just a headache. Because they’re immature and childish. They’re just another problem. But when men are older, they know how to make you happy. Because they’ll take care of you, and they understand you. Because... They're open-minded. They have lots of experience. You know, your father loved me very much. We never fought. He understands me and was very patient with me. That’s why we were happy with each other. How old was I again when my father died? You were almost two years old back then. You were still naive. How did he die? Heart attack. Why did he have a heart attack? It happened while we were making love. Can you stop asking too much? You’re giving me a headache. Mom? What now? Do you know the meaning of charisma? I told you not to ask me questions anymore. I can’t understand what I’m watching. Isn’t it when you become attracted to someone because of her charm, right? For crying out loud! You talk too much! Why can’t you just massage me? Never mind! Just go to your room. - I’ll stop now. - What is up with you? I rarely ask you to do something for me. Yes, yes. Right there, on the shoulders. Okay. Can you let me relax for once? You keep on asking questions. [moaning] [sensual song playing] [moaning] [rain pouring] Hey! I’m not peeking. I’m just looking for my goat. I just slipped, sorry. Hey! You bastard! Why? You’re going to leave it like that? Fix that! I know you’re peeping at me What? Of course not! I’m just looking for my goat. Then why is your cock hard until now? That’s how it is. Is that bewitched? Show it to me. - What? - Take it out. What? That. Bring it out, or I’ll go out? [moaning] [panting, moaning] [moaning] [crickets chirping] Eat up mom, the food is delicious. [crickets chirping] There's something I noticed. You’re changing. You’re becoming more handsome. Because, you’re now taking a bath everyday. [laughing] Before, you only took a bath once a week. What changed? Of course, you told me to fix myself. You know what? I remember your father. How come? Because, he’s also stylish. He’s fashionable, clean, always smells good. Even his shoes are clean and very shiny. Even when he was still courting me. Wait a minute. Are you courting someone? - Hey! - No, I’m not courting anyone, just eat. I’ll give you some advice. Don’t ruin yourself because of girls. There’s plenty of girls out there, you can still choose because you’re still young. You said I’m not a kid anymore. Don’t interrupt me, I’m still giving you advice. Listen to me. Don’t ruin yourself for girls. “Be careful with your decisions in life.” Don’t you have a new advice? You’re so cute, come here. I could just squeeze you. Let’s just eat, mom. Oh, you're so cute! - I’ll get one kilogram. - One kilogram, ma’am? Thank you! [chattering] Good morning to all members of the cooperative. I am Attorney Glenda Uy, I am just reminding everyone that we’ll be having a meeting at twelve noon. It’s about the demand letter against Luzviminda Gawaran. What if your mom came back? No, she won’t, she’s still at a meeting. [moaning] Am I the only one? Of course not, I have a boyfriend at home, in the streets, and you, here at the market. It’s unfair, you rarely go here. If you don’t want that kind of arrangement, find someone new. [moaning] No, it’s fine, I love fucking you. So that’s how it is then. Are you enjoying this? It’s okay. It’s hard to move in this place. At least we have somewhere to fuck, you complain too much. Anyone there? Can I buy something? Betbet? Just a moment! Hey, Karisma. Can I get a bottle of brandy? Your uncle still hasn’t stopped drinking? Yes, he doesn’t want to quit. He said it makes him happy. Elders are really stubborn. So, how is he? He can now walk a little bit, but I still support him. I’m amazed by your perseverance. You should make him stop drinking, so you won’t have a hard time. Why are you here? Where’s your mom? She’s in a meeting. Yeah, I saw her earlier. They said they’ll kick out all the vendors here. What? Because of the debt the cooperative owes to the owner of this market. Three million! What? Three million? The president collects their rent every month. But apparently, she didn’t give it to the owner. She took all the money, and is now hiding. Mom is really worried. Because if they’re unable to pay the three million debt. They’ll be gone here for good. Three million? Where will they find a place to relocate to? This is the only marketplace here. Three million? Do you have that kind of money? Maybe you can lend them some? [sighs] Well, I’ll go now. Okay. What happened to your cock? Just suck it again. Come on, suck it. [moaning] More. [dog barking] Here’s your change, thank you! Karisma! What are you doing here? Let me in. He’s still asleep. [sensual music playing] He might wake up. No, he won’t. Not here. You’ve got a toilet here, why do you take a bath outside? The water here is dirty. I don’t want to fetch water. Let’s do this quickly. [moaning] Karisma! [moaning] [moaning] Karisma! [panting] Why? I was just in the bathroom. Because my stomach hurts. Why? What did you eat? Okay, make me a cup of coffee. What now? [sighs] I’ll boil some water first. I'll give it to you in a second. Get right to it then. And while you’re doing that, come here. I missed you, you know that? You’re so beautiful. Wait. I’ll do the dishes first. [kettle boiling] Hey! [kettle boiling] Sit right there. [sensual music playing] [metal clanking] What was that? It’s nothing. [moaning] [moaning] Time out! I can’t catch my breath. I can't breathe. Edmar? Edmar? Mom’s not here. What? I saw her at the market. She said she’s going to get her nails done. We have no money, yet she’s going to get her nails done? You’re too negative. This makes her happy. You really look like a player now. Are you a good fucker? Just wait for her here. Stay here for a while. Why are you so grumpy? Come here and let’s talk first. Since your mom’s not here yet. Right? Stop frowning already. What can I do to make you happy? It's up to you. What do you want? Are you down? What if I say, that's what I want. This? Go ahead. Eat it. [moaning] You want that? [creaking] Divine! Did I keep you waiting? I told you to call before going to my house. I just arrived here. Actually, I'm about to call you. Wait a second. I need to go to the bathroom. Wait! Edmar's inside. Edmar! Hurry up! I need to pee! Come here. [chattering] What kept you so long? I really need to pee! Divine, I'll just go to the bathroom. Sure, go ahead. I will wait here. Okay. [rain pouring] [thunder rumbling] [laughing] Beautiful! You're such a bad girl! [laughing] Bad girl! [sighs] [snoring] Stay here. Karisma. Why are you here again? He's sleeping already. You can let me in. Don't make any noise. You dance so well. I was watching you a while ago. [moaning] [moaning] [moaning] [panting] Where did you go? Nowhere. What do you mean nowhere? I'm asking you where did you go? Up on the hill. I just checked the water hose. Stop joking around, Edmar! I'm telling you! [sighs] Attorney, can you do this... last will and testament that I made. I did this before I had a stroke. Check it out. Sure. So, based on what is written here... You will give all your inheritance and bank savings. That is worth 20 million. Yes. And all of this will be inherited by your adopted daughter, Maria Karisma Oliveria. - Is that right? - Yes, all of it. Yes. - Is she here? - Who? Karisma? Karisma! Come! Come over here! I will introduce you to my daughter, Karisma. He is Attorney Jimmy. Jimmy Acosta. He will arrange my last will and testament that I will give to you. So… How old are you? I’m 22. Oh, you're 22. Do you have a… Husband? Child? - Boyfriend? - No. She doesn't have one. I don’t allow it because she's still in school. She will finish her studies. - Studying? - Yes. What course are you taking? Nursing. Wow, nursing. Yes, but she stopped studying because I got sick. That's why I told her to take care of me first. But this upcoming school year, she will continue to study. Just a second. What do you want to drink, Attorney? Coffee? Juice? Juice. Alright. Get him a juice. How'd she become your adopted daughter? I was close to Karisma's family. Her father was working for me as a draftsman. - I was an architect. - I see. I had a business, because I'm a building contractor. In other words. The reason why me and her family became close is because of a common friend's wedding. After that, I always visit their house. She started calling me uncle. Yes, until... I caught her attention, because of the treats I gave her. [chuckling] When she was 12 years old… 12 years old? Yes, when she was 12 years old, she experienced a big tragedy in her life. Her parents... They had a car crash. Her mother was dead on arrival at the hospital. Her father was in a grave condition, he was in shock. He lived, but only for a short moment. But when he died, he asked me to take care of Karisma. So… I see… Do you have any relatives left? No one. My marriage didn’t work out. Because of my business, I had to go to different places and had to leave my wife. Sad to say, she found someone else. So, you mean, from 12 years old to 22 years old, she has been living with you for ten years now. That’s right. What should we do? I think we should make an affidavit, so that the support documents would be stronger. Okay, that's good. so that it would be approved by the court. Yes. Is it possible... Attorney, can you... Can you do that today? Of course. It's easy. May I know your real name? - Vicencio De Leon. - Vicencio De Leon... Paras! (moaning) Demetrio? Who is that? What? Get dressed. Shit, we never got to finish! What’s the matter with you, Edmar? You always leave me hanging. Damn it! When can we meet again? Why did you come here? - I’ll just leave then. - Don't. I think you’re busy. It’s nothing. Let's go there. Who’s with you at home? Just my mother. But she’s at her stall in the market right now. She comes home late. Have a seat. Then who’s the girl with you? Girl? No one. I heard it. I said, it's nothing. - Is he asleep? - Yes. But... I can’t stay long. What is your relationship with him? Is he your husband? Are you married to him? No. He adopted me. Huh? What? I was a child when he adopted me. My mother and father died. He’s my father’s friend. He was close to us. I call him uncle. That’s why he adopted me. Don’t you have a relative? I have. But all of them are in the province. I don’t know them. They also don’t know me. What’s his name again? Vicencio. He is good to me. I became close to him. But of course, I’m still a child back then. I have no malice yet. We were living in Manila. But he’s molesting you. At first, he just touches my hair, the back of my neck, and then, my legs. He told me... He loves me very much, and he will never leave me. You believe that? It’s true he didn’t leave me. But he’s molesting you. At first, I was scared. But it became normal to me. After all, we’re not blood related. How old were you when he got your virginity? We keep on moving from house to house. If someone suspects, we'll leave that town. Because I’m just a minor. You know, if I’ll adopt you. I will do the same. Because you really like doing it. It's been about a year since we've lived here. He already bought the house and lot. We really looked into a secluded town. He got a stroke here. What’s your plan? Nothing. I’ll just play around with you without him knowing. What if we got caught? That’s why, don’t ever come to my house. You are just allowed in the bathroom. Just the bathroom? That’s it? Even, tricycle. I can be anywhere. [moaning] You assholes! [gunshot] [panting] [crying] [rustling] [crying] If you want to go, that is fine. You are free. I understand where you’re coming from. [crying] I will give you money. Finish school. Everything you need… The condominium in Manila, I want you to live there. Do not mind me. I know, I’ll be dead soon enough. There’s just one thing I want you to know, whatever it is that I did wrong, please forgive me. I don’t want you to die. I don’t want leave you. You did nothing wrong. Nothing. I love you. So much. I just can’t figure out how to say it. I love you. Wow. You keep on sharpening your machete. I’ll cut someone’s throat. Whose throat? Do it to me. If you want, you can cut through my pussy. You want it? Do it! What? Go on. Ugh! Don’t waste your anger there. It won’t fight back. I’ll slash you! You’re not in the mood? Get out! Leave! Stop it! Don’t push me! Crazy! Stupid! Idiot! Ugh! Ah! I’ll kill you! [panting] Edmar! [gunshot] Edmar, you monster! [gunshot] Vicencio! [screaming, crying] Monster! You monster! Vicencio! [screaming, crying] You monster! [screaming, crying] [screaming, crying] [screaming, crying] [crying] [crying] Help… [screaming] Karisma! [chattering] Please stay here. Stay here. [chattering] Did you see him while killing your uncle? Yes. He really wants to kill my uncle. That’s why I shot him. Do you know him? Miss, are you okay? Edmar… [crying] Edmar… What have you done? Why did you do it? Why? You’ll go to jail! You’ll get arrested! [crying] [crying] [crying] Attorney. Three million pesos? Three million pesos! Attorney, is this a joke? That is my client’s donation for your cooperative. Out of good will. So, you can pay all your debt to the market’s owner. Sign here, Attorney. That means, that person knows us. Attorney, is it okay to know who your client is? Sorry, they don't want to reveal their identity. [chattering] How can we thank her, Attorney? I’m really sorry, but it's confidential. I really can’t. Okay, this is it. Oh, I'm shaking! Three million! This is it! We got it! This is a gift from the heavens! A miracle! I wish God would bless her! Overflowing blessing, Loleng. I can now pay for my son’s tuition! Overflowing! Overflowing blessings from heaven! Thank you, Lord! Thank you so much! Thank you so much. Thank you, Attorney. They already got it. Thank you, Attorney. Just tell me what you want, and I’ll give it to you. As long as I can manage. You don’t have to thank me. Your uncle Vicencio entrusted me to take care of you. One of our agreements is that I would personally take care of you. Unless, you want to fire me. I won’t fire you. - Why would I do that? - Alright. If that’s the case, I’ll escort you to your condo in Manila. You can start a new life there. Alright. Just tell me, okay? [gate creaking]
