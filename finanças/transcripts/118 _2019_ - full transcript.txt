What dude, aren’t you still ready? What’s the time? It’s 8:30 Damn, I got late Why are you so tired? By chance, did you ring anyone without my knowledge in the night yesterday? You go and I’ll come getting ready, -ok Get ready fast. -5 Minitues Why are you dull, dude...? I got a dream yesterday night, dude A dream? A girl in the dream A girl? Some two people are hitting the girl in dream, They are torturing her. They pushed a car from top of the hill into river. I felt like I was seeing all this being by her side Her face and her look... In fact it is dream great time to believe me. Who is that girl? I didn’t understand at all Huh! What, dude? Why do you take so much tension for the dream that comes in the night and vanishes by morning? They say it a dream as it never happens. I understood one thing, Even devils do come along with humans to the guest house in the outskirts for relaxing... Not a devil, I got the same dream once before also The same dream? I’m saying the same... Do you remember? 6 months back, marriage of our Ravi took place in this same resort. It was the same dream then and the same girl, The same room then and now What’re you talking dude...? What’s the same room? I too don’t understand the same... Same room, room number 118... I didn’t bother much when the dream came for the first time, but when it came for the second time, Same room and the same dream... I’m unable to believe, dude. Even if you can’t believe, I’m believing and saying, that’s definitely a matter of devils. You go home, have a cleansing from evil sights and take a rest Don’t ever look back at this resort again. Understood? Dude. your favorite black coffee Hey dude. We thought these strange dreams are just my experience alone, right? Come on, look at this website once Many are sharing their strange dreams experienced on this A company faced a big problem. Not getting a solution for the software they are to develop, when all were struck and in panic, solution of this problem was found through the dream of a small employee just joined With that, he got a car and promotion... Life changed in one shot, dude. Dude, you always do anything with logic. Why’re you thinking so seriously about this with no logic at all? But, why is this same dream coming to me again and again? Drink the coffee first, have it I welcome you all to the magical world of dreams... The magical symphony visuals and thoughts by the billions of neutrons existing in our mind are these dreams Who’s this fellow? -A grand opera consist, I shall meet him -conducted Yes, he’s correct for you Dude... Will there be so much in a human brain? That’s for a human Not for someone like you Good morning Doctor, Do something Morning Sir Yes morning... Who are you? When did you come? -It’s been half an hour Sir Ok, what’s the problem? I had a dream Doctor, a very peculiar one I went to stay in a resort... Room number 118. Like beating some girl in that dream... Doctor, all seemed very strange This is what called... A miracle a miracle of science. The brain... This case is the perfect example for this This brain of ours is like a hard disk How much GB Sir? Hmm... as you said a hard disk In this hard disk like brain, everything like what you are, your name, incidents that happened in your life, your thoughts will be stored. Even the dreams you got are stored in the same But not everything can be remembered. Unnecessary data trash will automatically be deleted. I’ve never seen that girl, but why is she always coming into only my dream? Doctor... -Night mare. A night mare dreams as you got would never be deleted You know why? As the dream you got first while staying in that room is strongly stored as it was interesting. After 6 months, same room same atmosphere... Your hard disk re-winded your old dream and played it We are now trying to picturise the dreams. If we succeed in that, we can clearly know about even the brain activities of a Coma patient. Not just that, but there is also the next level. No need to be either a Doctor or a scientist to know that Even common man can experience the dream and be a part of it. Do you want to see? Do you want to experience the dream? No, don’t need all this, Doctor. Should I take my dream serious or not? Just say that Take it easy and carry on with your life. I’ve already said, right? This is just a thriller film created by your mind, that’s all Megha, come out How...? I can identify your perfume smell even when you’re in a Million people I agreed Sir, you are Sherlock Holmes. Will you go with any girl who has this perfume on? Maybe anyone uses this perfume, But when the smell comes after touching your body and that makes it more special. Do you know that? Really Moon is in hands, but moonlight is in the clouds Flower tree is before eyes, but the flowers are on the branch How long just to see, what’s wrong if touched? Don’t you see the pain of this bachelor? Calculating about the wedding date Won’t you let me romance? Oh my God, what’ve you done? Gave a cheque and stopped signing Oh my God, you depressed me Gave I-phone and locked the screen I’ll promise you with hand in hand I’d never let my feet walk away from you. I filled your face in both my eyes It’s you in me even when eyes closed Love is a birth where two are one The Moon... Moon is in hands, but moonlight is in the clouds. Flower tree is before eyes, but the flowers are on the branch How long just to see, what’s wrong if touched? Don’t you see the pain of this bachelor? Calculating about the wedding date Won’t you let me romance? Oh my God, what’ve you done? Gave a new bike and hid the key Oh my God, you depressed me Gave ATM and put a no-cash board Sir... -Goutham, Nothing happened to you, right? I am fine sir. Did you get any information about the lorry...? I informed JC And they’re tracing out. They will not leave them. By the way, where are you? I am in the city outskirts. I'll reach office in one hour. Ok. That same river...? that same car in the river..? Yes, dude. I can't beleive this. Even i can't be believe this I never believed this dream is real. The lake coming into my dream exists, car exists. The most important thing than all these is the girl coming into my dreams You think that girl exists? Maybe yes To know about that girl, the only clue we have is that car. Maybe we get to know about the girl if we can find out whose car is that Correct... But, how will you get the car out? How will you get the car out? Yes... Joint Commissioner is my friend, What if we take his help? Hello Control Room... This is JC Ravinder. Ford Icon and silver color, Please check in all near by stations is there any missing complaint lodged on this car? fast. Tell me. Are you seeing the news, Rony? You said not to take tension and see now, they’ve brought the car out You stay silent and I’ll take care of it Tell me Sir, Police brought that car out You are ten minutes late Rony... I saw that news even before you. sir I’ll make it all stop here without any further enquiry Don’t do such crazy thing. If you try to stop them, they will try to find out more. Just keep watching them and try to know what they want to do Ok Sir Goutham, I spoke with CM. That Siddha Reddy won’t mess with you again, So, you carry on with your case. -Okay, Sir. Goutham, we got the car details. This is a complaint registered in Malakpet Station. And you know, this isn’t just about a car missing but also about a girl missing case. Thank you Sir We will call you if we get any information. Keep this car on the back side Ok Sir Dude, I’ll just be back dude... I came with full details And along with phone details too. Name of that girl is Esther. You remember... someone is just gone, He is the Church father she used to live at his orphanage home. She’s missing from October 6th Dude... As I like you a lot, Here I brought the photo of your dream girl, see. Give it. What, isn’t she that girl? Pinnamaneni's Wedding Invitation. card is super. Baby Megha, show it to Goutham See this. Your marriage is in a few days And that’s your wedding card. If you tie the knot with this same dull face, our relatives will think you don’t like this marriage. Look Megha, you may be his dream girl once. But now the dream girl is different. Sir will be in this same mood, till he gets that girl. You went to station saying to have some details, You didn’t get? We got, we even got the photo But that girl isn’t her. Story is back to the start again. Now, the lake in my dream is true... Car in the lake is true... Even the girl missing along with car is true... Then, there should be some connection in between the girl from my dream and this missing girl, Yes, right? Give this file in the office, sister Ok father Esther. Esther was four years when she came to our orphanage. She grew up here, studied here and she was teaching the children here and used to often help me Then, that car father? Car... Car... It belongs to our orphanage. She used to take it when she needed it. Did she particularly say to meet anyone on the day she went missing? No. Does Esther have any close friends? She was very reserved Ok, then any enemies? We are into God’s service, son Can we see Esther’s room father? books, clothes and mother Mary. There are no any big items Thus we converted her room three months back into the class room and using that. I’ve got some work and if you may please leave... Ok father thank you thank you father Will they convert room into class room if vacant for 8 months? Will they make it a College if vacant for a year? He definitely decided that the girl will not come back. I feel some doubt looking into his eyes, you think there’s some link to the Church father in this? Dude... why are you so much disturbed from when you met the Church father? If I’d got some details about Esther, I’d have got a clue about my dream. But nothing is found. How now What to do..? Hello, is it? Are you fine now, madam? Goutham, Megha... Come... Come on, How are you Vijay? That’s the question we shall ask You don’t listen whatever we say. It’s good that you stay with us,mom? We were tensed a lot when we got the sudden call, mother in law Nothing dear... BP went a bit high And fell unconscious and that’s it None listens to me when I say not to tell you. What did the Doctor say? -He said no problem. He asked to take BP tablets regularly. She always forgets even when we say. How, if you forget mom? Three of you came in the Sun, go and eat first Grandma, it seems grandpa wants to talk to you How are you now, sister? I’m fine dear What Goutham, how are you? I’m fine uncle, how are you? I’m fine dear. What Megha, are the marriage works on at pace? Yes, they’re going well uncle Are your mom and dad fine, dear? Yes, they’re fine uncle It’s on the way, come even to our Yadagiri Gutta while returning back ok uncle What Goutham, you’ll come right? Goutham, Goutham, Yes, we’ll come uncle. Megha too wants to see Yadagiri Gutta and I’ll get her ok.. come.. I said a gate came in my dream, right? This is the symbol on that gate I understood right then, that your third eye saw something. Is this the one? Uncle, where is this printing press? It isn’t there now, son. It’s been six months since it’s closed down I said right, this is the gate God is very great. If some Pakistan or Afghanistan had come into your dream, you’d have taken us even to there Maybe we get some clue going in, come on Aadhya... What happened..? Hey dude, I said it right? That the girl from my dream would be there, see This girl? Name is Aadhya What’s there like missing? There is a number below that address, try it Yes... Not reachable Who is it? Aadhya’s father? Please come, Did you get anything about Aadhya? I know that she’d come back some day. I unnecessarily felt tensed. Please come and be seated Sorry Sir, we came to know about Aadhya It’s been 8 months since she went missing. There isn’t any place not seen and no man unasked about for her. She’s my daughter whom I loved like my life. It’s just a missing case for the Police. She...? Aadhya’s mom... She used to keep chanting Aadhya’s name from the day she went missing. Maybe she lost the hope to find Aadhya, she left me alone four months back and died. And I’m here like this alone... Sir, can we see Aadhya’s room? I know that every thought about Aadhya will make you sad, but if you can give us information about her, it will help us She used to work as a software Engineer. She didn’t like and quit her job. She likes to travel She used to say, wants to see the whole world flying like a bird, with me. Traveling so, she was doing any work on her way with whole heart and was very happy. When did you meet Aadhya for the last time? 5th October... 5th October... was her mom’s birthday. She brought a cake for her mom and we are celebrated. Aadhya asked that day. At times in life, when we don’t know what decision to take should we go on doing what our heart likes or to do what’s good for us. I said her that we shall definitely do what our heart likes. That’s it, she went missing from that day. I don’t know what exactly happened and why she asked so Maybe it was good if I had asked that day. It was my mistake, my mistake... Sir, cool down Sir The faith that she’d be back some day is keeping me alive I feel that faith is true seeing you. Will you bring Aadhya back, son? Goutham keep doing whatever you are doing. In whichever way we can help that old man, he’d feel very happy. That girl should be safe at least for her father. We shall somehow know how that girl is and what she is doing. We got Aadhya’s missing date by coming here. Even Esther went missing from the same date as per the Police records October 6th 2017. We don’t know what happened to Esther But, as per my dream, Aadhya may have come to stay in that resort room number 118. Or she may have come to meet those who stayed in that room. Who was in that room on that date? Hi Sir Yes, Sir... how can I help you? Yes... I need some information Can you say on whose name is room 118 booked on the 6th October? Definitely Sir, Rural development summit took place on that day. I’ll check the details Hey dude, I came here on that rural development summit day Did you come here? Yes, but I wasn’t here even for 5 minutes. Yes, got a call that our Siddarth met with an accident. I went back immediately Damn! I forgot about this in that tension Sir, there was none in room 118 that day Can you please check once again? I checked perfectly Sir, none stayed that day none stayed that day Can you at least check your CCTV footage? Oh, sorry Sir. We’ll just have 6 months data. October 6th means it’s already been 8 months. But the guy who covered that day’s event is my friend Hello Sir, someone is enquiring about room 188 and October 6th Police? No Sir Forward the video. bit more just go back once... play Hey, Aadhya Correct dude, what you guessed was correct. Aadhya came to resort that day Just forward a bit, why did Aadhya go missing so fast? Forward a bit What you saw is the edited version. All the rushes are in another hard disk. Hard disk is missing. there is no chance to miss the hard disk. I'll check and call back to you. Thank you Sir What shall we do? Come, I’ll say -Where? Why did you bring to this room, Dude... what is there? Hey dude, I’m asking you Hey, give that pencil from the table I won’t come -Hey, give it take this We’re staying here this night Are you mad...? why to stay here now? Aadhya came to this resort in the video we saw. I got the same dream, both the times I stayed in this room. So, definitely something has happened to Adhya in this room. To know what happened, I should get that dream again. For that to come, I should stay here tonight Why do you lift both at once? Will you give one to the devil? No dude, I had two pegs that day. Same condition setup... I’m setting up to make it ready You are the... real investigative journalist. I too had a full then and I’ll continue. Why are you looking at the time? I slept at 11 P.M that day. Time now is 10:50, see you Is it any first night see the time and go? It’s third night. Dude. by chance the devil won’t come to my room by getting confused, right? Hey, go to sleep, dude. Hello... Did you get the dream? What’s your nuisance when I’m tensed not getting sleep? You’re dead in my hands, if you call again. Cut that. You know, from how long am I knocking? I was so tensed that devil finished you. Did you get the dream? No, it didn’t come. You didn’t get? All went correctly and you also had two pegs in time, right? What may have happened, why didn’t that come? What did I miss? Date Aadhya went missing was October 6th 2017, date I got my first dream was December 3rd 2017, it was 29th May 2018 when I got the dream second time. I didn’t get the third time. That date is 17th June 2018. The similarity in between these three dates isn’t there on the fourth date. There’s something special about the set of three days. Maybe, all those three are on the same week day, right? No, the day Aadhya went missing was Friday, first dream was on Sunday and second dream was on Tuesday. Something common for three days, come on, come on... Open the 10th Anniversary photos once. Ravi’s marriage photos are there check it once give it once yes, I got it. What, got it? Guys, it’s full moon day Full moon Yes Megha, Aadhya went missing on 6th October and that was a full moon day. Both my dreams came on the full moon day Why my 3rd dream didn’t come is because yesterday wasn’t a full moon day. If I can particularly be in that room on the next full moon day at this resort, I’ll get the dream again. Then, when is the next full moon day? June 26th. June 26th. So, we have to wait for another 10 days So, you decided to go to the resort on the next full moon day Yes Megha say one thing Goutham. You are getting dream on full moon day too is a theory, right? What...? is it just a theory? You saw it, right? All the three days have exactly matched to full moon day If seen so, did only two full moon days come in these 8 months? Two full moon days... Yes Megha Yes, -What? Your brain works very sharp in anger. You know how important point did you say? Thank you... Hmm... I’m here. What is that much interesting topic she said for you to kiss and lift her? After Aadhya went missing, leaving aside the two full moon days I got the dream, six full moon days have come. As per my theory, even those staying in that room on these six days should have got the similar dream as me. If it had come... We have two benefits First, I can prove my full moon as correct. Second is the most important, we can know where Aadhya is with the information from the dream Eight full moon days and eight dreams in them... Same dream coming to six more along with you, looking for any clue in those dreams, you searching for Aadhya... How dude? How do you get all such ideas? What’s this lucky number 8? Hello I’m Aadhya talking Who...? who is that speaking? I’m Aadhya speaking... Hello.. Hello.. Hello.. Nothing happened to you, right dude? Are you ok? Hello I’m Aadhya speaking. I’m safe and please don’t search for me Hello, hello... Hello, hello... Damn! Come on, come on pick up... Huh! Hi Goutham Sir, I’ll send you a number. Can you please trace the location of that number and send me? Sure Goutham What happened, dude? Aadhya Aadhya? No idea where she is... And why she called... Sir... Goutham, The number you gave is traced at Chudi bazaar beside Charminar Goutham... we are tracking your number too with that number. It’s showing 800 meters right from the place you are at. Yes, go straight. Yes, straight Just come a bit back... Come back a bit Yes, you’re on target... Yes 200 Meters to your left, 100 Meters to the right is target It seems like some warehouse Goutham Hey Goutham, Target is moving out Go 500 meters forward in the direction you are going Keep going Goutham, Keep going... Go straight, straight Straight and take a right, 100 meters to your right Yes, yes Goutham 600 meters to your right Yes Goutham, now you are a bang on target Damn! Enough of the trouble taken till now. That girl called saying not to take trouble, right? Why are you so tensed? No... Something is wrong Let’s imagine what you said is correct Till now she never met me and doesn’t even know who I am And how does she know that I’m searching for her? No chance for her to know If, by any chance she was in a trouble and got chance to call, she’d have first called her dad If not she’d have called the Police Why did she call me? How did she get my number? Aadhya didn’t make that phone call Then who did? Someone doesn’t like us to know about Aadhya They made that call to deviate us I understood dude. What I believed is correct in Aadhya's matter. The point where we stopped this trial, let’s again start from the same point It’s me, I need your help Please say Some people have to be taken care of Leave it to me and I’ll take care You stay right here and I’ll go bring the room details Six full moon days came till date from Aadhya’s missing date And none stayed in that room for three full moon days in those In the other three full moon days Velayudham from Chennai, Javed Ali from Hyderabad and this girl Namrata Ram on the last day checked out by 8Pm without staying in the night We don’t have any work with this girl We shall first meet, Javed Ali Grandpa...

Tomorrow Why did you lie to me, father? Why did you make that call like Aadhya is alive? Where are Aadhya and Esther? Esther Father For her To save her life, whom I brought like my daughter from her childhood Thus, I don’t see any other way out than to send her away from here But after sending to Vizag, I thought everything was fine for few days But, when you came searching for her to the church I understood That, this isn’t going to stop with this They’d kill knowing that Esther is alive Thus, she should be sent from here To send her away to Vatican city...

Wear them Oh, are we too the volunteers? - Yes Bye sister - Bye I’ll give a complaint about this What the hell is doing here?

Sorry, vaccinations are over... Ok. - I'll send to you, you go. Madam, ask all your school children also to get vaccinated Oh no, we are frightened You shouldn’t say no. Vaccine is for our health Sister, Prabhavati refuse to take the vaccination. Prabhavathi, come here - Sister, no please why are you crying? - Please sister Prabhavathi, will you become Doctor after growing big or not? Yes. Then, how if you fear for such a small injection? No, no sister please - Come on, listen to me and get it done Please sister, please - Ok, we will do one thing Sister will give you vaccination, ok?

You made so much noise for such a small matter This trip has changed my life, Esther Mom and dad brought me up without knowing any problems at all Look at Prabhavathi. Her dream is to become a Doctor But you know, how much trouble is her mom taking to just send her to school? And to make her a Doctor means... To get all such educated, we shall all do something together You know... My dad asks what my goal in life is I think this is my goal Good morning...Sister. -Hi... Good morning... Good morning Where’s Prabhavathi? Don't know, sister. Amrutha... Even Bhavani hasn’t come Don't know, sister. Prabhavathi Madam, what happened to Prabhavathi? She hasn’t come today She’s saying burning sensation all over the body from morning and is also in high fever I handed over to the neighbors while going for work When I returned and saw fever is gone very high When informed the medical shop person, he gave few medicines Madam, will you please get a wet cloth?

Prabhavathi, What happened to Aadhya? Prabhavathi’s death changed over Aadhya’s life All the bottles look same but the composition is different madam. One is Dengue vaccine and the other is totally different madam I’ll give a complaint about this What the hell is doing here? Hello... I should talk about the vaccine given to children at Dhannaram Medical camp How many? Doctor How many died? Aadhya -How did you ask, how many died? Did you know before that they’d die? Why didn’t you stop, when you knew? -Because they’d kill if stopped It isn’t so easy to answer the question like you asked, madam These days, cancer isn’t any disease Business source growing very fast in the world what was used in that camp was a vaccine named Bollorexy It’s viral vector used for Gene therapy Gene therapy? Sending vaccine through viral vector to edit the DNA in a person is called as Gene therapy. To alter the DNA structure evolving along with human from about 300 Million years means... When some say it is directly a big risk for the human race And some say no and if this is success, many diseases with no cure till date like HIV and cancer can be avoided forever This debate is on amongst many worldwide If this really is successful need with medicines in future would rapidly go down Future is genetics Eyes of all big Corporate Companies are now on this Because profits are in Billions of Crores Manufacturer of this vaccine taking lives of many girls you knew is this Alanta Company It is very difficult to take a permission for these type of vaccine. It's illegal in a lot of countries. Thus, all these Companies select third world countries and to conduct pilot tests illegally on the names of trusts and NGOs are directly testing selecting girls aged 15 to 18 years This is a big system, a chain of corruption If we know, who more are involved into this, our hearts would stop You are saying to fight against them Kill your heart and you’ll at least be alive Stay out of it I too asked Aadhya to leave all these and go far away But she didn’t listen to me She with all the evidences gathered went to the school head master This District Collector is my old student. We will meet him tomorrow morning and explain all this Ok Sir Hey, what.. it seems you are trying to get the details about the camp? I will kill you if you involve again in this matter. Go. Please move aside. Will you please move aside? What happened? -Head master slipped in the bathroom and died, madam Aadhya... Aadhya, I’m very frightened You leave all these and immediately go to your place How do I go? Though was saying no and crying, I gave injection to Prabhavathi with my own hands Knowing it all, how do you say me to be silent without doing anything? Aadhya, listen to me, they would kill you. -No problem. No problem I can’t live with this guilt, Esther I can’t forget those kids dying in my hands Esther, you do if you wish to I’ll look into it - Aadhya Okay. One of my friends has influences here in powerful places. I called him, said the matter and asked what to do It seems, there is an event this evening at Paradise resort He asked us to come there If we go there, he’d say what to do Evening 7’o clock 7’o clock...Ok - Yes, 7’o clock We bother went to Paradise Resort for meeting my friend with a hope to find answers for Aadhya's questions. Adhya, you sit right here. I’ll go see, where he is My friend saying to help me didn't come there. He didn't lift my call too. After sometime, I got a call that he met with an accident. I going there with great hope there, didn't know what to do listening to what has happened. When looked for Aadhya to say what happened, she wasn't seen there. Another girl is there with her... come on, search for her. Did you find her...? -No. Okay, come. That night, not knowing what to do, in fear... I left Aadhya right there and came running away in fear poor....Aadhya. Three days... Aadhya risked her life for a kid whom she just knew from three days We shall give support to Aadhya’s goal Sir Whoever is behind this... Whatever big maybe this issue... We shall pull everyone out Sir. We shouldn’t spare anyone What you said is correct Goutham. But, we need evidence, right? They killed Murthy and Raghuram, disturbed coming to your house and left you alive means a confidence that you don’t have the evidence What can we do with no proof? Try to understand Goutham, you can’t do anything -Why not? Why can’t we do anything? For every dream I get and every clue I get in my dream, there’s some reason Lake that came in my dream took me till Esther Trinethra symbol on the gate... This took me till Aadhya This came in the dream of Mr. Velayudham and made us know about Prabhavathi Sketch drawn by Javed Ali’s son... St. Mary’s symbol took me back to the Church again Everything... Everything is happening for a reason Aadhya is trying to tell something to me. Bloody hell, I’m not able to find it I’m not getting Sir Where exactly is that girl? I’m missing out on something I’m not seeing properly, no focus Focus Goutham... Focus This symbol... I saw somewhere... I saw somewhere... Did you observe? Lotus symbol... It’s in Adhya’s bracelet. See, even this Buddha symbol is there in bracelet See, flower and Om... Even these are there in her bracelet There is something in this bracelet, there is something in the bracelet To know where this bracelet is, we should know about Aadhya To know where Aadya is, I should get that dream Tomorrow is full moon day and if I stay in room number 118 and I get that dream again, I’ll know everything dude What dude, why do you say should get the dream again and again? Will you know where Aadhya is, just by getting the dream? That’s a dream and this is real... Think of it Even a common man can experience a dream and be part of it Come fast Oh sorry, sorry Doctor Oh my God... I just... I just don’t believe it When I came the last time, you said anybody can go into the dream and can be the part of that dream Can I go into that dream? Can I feel everything happening there? Huh! This fellow is saying like from the film Inception Is that really possible, Doctor? Definitely, yes Name of that is Lucid Dreaming, the position in between sleep and the state of awakening Though you are in dream your consciousness will be with the awakening To be more simple, your body will sleep and your mind will be awake in the dream You can see and hear everything happening in dream like you are directly seeing them You can feel air, fragrance and everything. But, there is some risk in that It’s easy to go into Lucid Dreaming But to stay in that for more than 10 minutes is dangerous No problem Doctor, I’m ready Why all these Doctor? Will I get the dream only then? No, it’s just for my observation, you just don’t worry I’ll now give you a medicine That will bring down your anxiety, cool down your heart and takes you to sleep Do you remember what happened when you came to this hospital? Yes Doctor Focus that again completely Ok -Just look at your watch Is the seconds hand running in that? It’s running -But, that won’t run in the dream That is the indication to say that you are in dream For a test, I’m setting alarm for one minute That is the warning for you to come out from the dream Relax... Just close your eyes Slowly slip into the dream Come fast. Sorry doctor. Amazing Doctor, everything was so real The surroundings, I could feel it And one more thing, Don’t try to change anything happening in your dream Once done, it’s done Look, just a few days left for FD approval All my pride and investments lie in it. You better make sure what you’re doing There won’t be a need for you to call me once again I’ll call you next time with the news that... that fellow is finished Huh! Damn! Down!
