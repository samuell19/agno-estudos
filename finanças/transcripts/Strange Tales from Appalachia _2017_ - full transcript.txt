Do you even know how we're gonna get back? No You remember? No. That's what I'm saying - none of us remember! You know... That's exactly what he's been doing! Boom - yes! I got it - I know he'd do it. I don't know she could be dead for all we know it's just - Hey, hey, all right everything's okay. My name is Matt, this is Grant and Austin. Here's the situation, last night, you stumbled into our campsite, not saying anything and not wearing anything. We just covered you up right there by the fire where you fell and we've just been waiting for you to come to Are you hurt? What's your name? Valorie. Sorry what was that? It's okay I- I'm sorry I just didn't hear you. What is it? Valorie Okay, Valorie, we're just letting you know what we know Right. We're just trying to help you we want to make sure that you're okay. What were you doing out here last night? Look, this is a weird situation for - I don't know. That's okay. That's fine. Um. No. No it's not fine. Where am I? We're on the south side of Roan Mountain. What? It's in Mitchell County - No, I know where that is but doesn't make any fucking sense. I - I wasn't - I wasn't coming here. I was- We weren't there long - Where did you go? I don't remember leaving. What do you remember then? Nothing probably. Dude this just sounds like she got drunk with her friends and then now they're just pulling some prank - Fuck you! Okay- I don't do that! Okay I'm just saying that you might have had too much. I mean it happens - You don't know me! I wouldn't have blacked out! Okay but you you keep saying you don't remember well I mean I'm sorry but that's what too much alcohol does to you, you black out So why did I end up in the fucking woods? I don't know! That's what we're trying to figure out Valerie! Dude! Dude! Look, this is very confusing for all of us, okay, but we're gonna be able to figure things out a lot faster if we all just just stay calm. Right. I'm sorry. Some guy came up to me at the bar started talking to me. All right. Did you know him? I need to go home. Yeah I mean that's that's what we were talking about before you woke up but we weren't sure if we should call the police - No don't call the police. Okay, okay I mean I was gonna say or like a park ranger or something maybe I mean someone that could get you off this mountain - No I don't want anyone else involved this is too much I - You want to go home I'm sorry you can't just click your heels and - Look, that's the only way. Look, I'm gonna go up to the fork in the path I got service up there I'm gonna call a park ranger come back here we'll walk you to the service road and- and he'll get you home. Hey, we're gonna take care of you. I'll come back as soon as I can guys Here, I'm sure you could use some of this. Thank you. I'm sure you're hungry too so there you go. Well, uh, I guess I'm gonna go get some firewood Austin are you cool to chill here? Yeah, I'm ok. Cool. Do you want some clothes? That's probably a rhetorical question huh? D'uh Austin. You could probably wear some of mine- kind of a small guy These shouldn't be too big on you. Thank you. Do you wanna - Should I just - I'll just, uh, I'll be over here - facing that way. Why are you laughing? I'm sorry I'm just uh this whole situation is it's bizarre- kind of caught me, us, by surprise I guess. Trust me I know. I'm sorry for getting upset earlier I, uh, I wanted to help you. I did, but, you were so distant. it was like you were mortified but you didn't know why and when I couldn't help, made me feel the same way. Everything alright in there? You okay? Yeah- I'm fine. I know it's selfish and I just couldn't be in that state of mind I've been there before in that darkness where do you go when your consciousness fails you you know what I'm saying? It, it's like you're unknowingly waiting and waiting for uncertainty. That's the weirdest part you don't even know what you're waiting for or that you're even waiting at all. Makes everything so visceral It's frightening. That's, uh, that's why I don't drink anymore. okay I'm uh I'm gonna stand up now surely you're - Valorie? Okay so this should be enough for now but I can go back and get more later. Where's the girl? She's out there. Why the fuck is she out there? What did you do? Oh I didn't do shit! I gave her some of my clothes. You acted like a pervy dick didn't you? No! Dude, this girl cannot handle that! No, I, I was just casually talking to her and trying to relate and shit that usually works I didn't know she was gonna run away! Jesus Christ, well, we have to get her! She cannot be out there alone- she could get lost or worse. Okay let's go Let's? As in 'let us'? No! We didn't lose her or let her go Dude, shut the fuck up and come and help me find her before something happens. I can't have that on my conscience. Valorie! Fuck. Valorie. Hey, hey it's okay It's okay, Valorie it's okay! It's us Grant and Austin. Valorie, I really don't feel that you should- I was raped. I can feel, I can feel everything this is real it's not going away Please don't! Right, I'm so sorry. That's okay Grant. Get me out of here. I want to go now. We'll get you out of here I mean as long as you don't take for the hills again. What did you think you were gonna do conquer the mountain? Okay I was scared I wasn't thinking. I just kept thinking he was out there even when I kept running I just couldn't get away from that thought. Well he'd better not be, if he knows what's best for him! And that's the truth. Look we are going to make sure that you're safe as long as you stay with us. Ok? Matthews probably been waiting on us we're running out of time and we still have to get our bags and get you to the service road Why can't we go now? Well your little stunt didn't actually leave us enough time to leave a note. Look don't worry. We'll get help soon enough. You okay? You know, for someone who has been in your situation you're really speeding through these woods. I mean don't get me wrong I understand but I'm a smoker. That's inappropriate, my fault. Hey, is everything okay? He didn't mean what he said- No, its... it's just, how did I let myself get here Oh Oh easy there Fuck! Let's uh, take a look. Valorie this really doesn't look very good- No, none of this looks good it's actually pretty fucked up. May I? What the fuck are you gonna do? Make it better? I need to see how much flexibility you have, if it's a severe sprain or worse you really need to take it easy. Take it easy? I need to take it easy? Would that be easier for you two? If I took it easy? I'm fine. Let's go. Fuck, oh! Fuck him, fuck this place, I wish he would have killed me instead of leaving me here like some goddamn helpless whore! Valorie look, I promise everything will be okay soon enough Okay!? Okay? None of this is okay. Everything that I had, everything that I have become is left here in these stupid woods! We're gonna get you home Yeah? Then what? You two get to rest assured knowing you helped out some poor stranded girl but me, I get to be exactly what I tried so hard not to be. A victim. Valorie, none of this is your fault. I don't need your sympathy, I don't need your help Easy. Hey what's that? It's a campsite. I didn't think people could camp on this side of the mountain. Well, you're not supposed to. Guys let me go, I'm fine. What is this? These are my clothes? Well this fire is still pretty fresh so I'm guessing he could be back at any moment. Austin I really think that we should- Hey what are those? I really don't think you should see these And you fucking should? Poor girl. Fuck you. I'm not your trophy. look I don't mean to rush you, but we probably should- Yeah... We should get out of here. Yeah that's right, this maniac, he's probably out here still. So is Matthew. Shit! Matty? Matty? Oh there you are. You. Yes, me. I had thought you wouldn't remember me. I thought you moved on one of these, boys. But since I can't be forgotten... You piece of shit, Grant- No no no please please please let's not do that. I understand that you're agitated and I sympathize I do but I'd like to keep things more orderly less graphic. So... right to the point at hand I have something, someone, that you want and you have something of mine I want. Fuck you dude, she doesn't belong to you! Yes, yes she does. Yes she does. Now I understand the two of you're acting out some instinct to protect the female from the situation but what I think you're failing to realize is this, I will slice your friends fucking throat and I will watch the blood pour out. And I will repeat that process two more times. So please, try to think rationally. Grant what do we do? I don't know man! No! No, no you can't! He raped me and left me to die! Rape is such a harsh word. Hey let's let's just forget about all this. No, no, no no no no no no! Shut up! That is not how this works! I am happy to let you all go but she is not leaving with you. Whatever fuck it, I'm tired of dealing with your people, you should have picked a better campsite! Wait! Okay okay! Good, good good good. I was starting to think the two of you were really fucking stupid. No! I'm sorry! No he's gonna kill me! I'm sorry I don't know what else to do Austin, Austin, you won't, you won't, you can't do this. He's our friend! We have no choice! You said you were gonna protect me, you can't do this, no, no! Well, there she goes! Don't worry, she won't get away. Oh... where are you going beautiful? Oh I see, that way? What a shame, you almost made it. Isn't this better? I think so. Happy couple together again. [heartbeat thumping I don't think either of us is in the mood for another chase. I gotta say I'm surprised by such desperation to get away, I mean, was I really that bad? I thought you and I had quite the connection before. There is something about you that excites me my dear No. How did a guy like me, end up with such a pretty girl? Oh! that reminds me Okay, where are they? What do you mean? Don't. Don't do that I'm not angry. In, in fact I'm glad, I'm glad you saw them. I mean, what did you think? Quite breathtaking right? What are you doing? We are leaving. Wha- Why? Stop taking me for a fucking fool! I know you saw the pictures, I know you were here and, and I assume those two fuckwits were with you and now they're out there coming up with some half-assed save the princess scenario so our time in the woods is over. Oh, fucking bitch! God! Ow! There, that's better behavior. Thank-you. You're right. I'll learn. But maybe you can teach me I like the idea of you taking control of me What? You don't think I remember that night? The way you charmed your way get me out of the bar into the car all the way out here I I wasn't as drugged as you thought I was. I was just weak to your powerful constrains. The control it was surreal. It was sensational. I want you to do it to me again right now. Really? If that's what you want. That's what you're gonna get! [WHACK} We're gonna get you out. Come on! Okay I'm sorry do you mind if we go over this one more time Valorie? Yes, I do mind. Okay, I have told you everything you need to know I told you at the station I told you on the phone and now I find myself hours later telling you here look I Look I understand it's a very sensitive situation for you to be in. I'm just trying to make sense of the things that I've been told. Could you do it someplace else? Unfortunately no. Look this is far too coincidental you have to know there have been other women in this area recently who have come forward with a very very similar narrative to what you've told me okay so you say these three guys, uh, Grant, Austin, Matthew right? Yes. Okay they find you in the woods after the incident they give you clothes they give you food they give you water they escort you to the hospital and then they just leave you they just drop you off? No, no not exactly- I have a nurse that says that you were alone- Yes I was alone but I was alive and it's because of those three. I'm sorry, just trying to cover all bases Well don't worry about that okay? I'm the victim I say when it's over. No more investigation, no more questions especially about those three. I'm able to have a life again because of them. ...just go with your your usual dark-haired chestnut-eyed looking girls Well I don't see any of them either, it's a little slim pickings out today Well you're the one who wanted to come to the park. Well nice girls are at the park. Oh what about her? No, she's, she's, well she's blonde and I don't like blondes they're annoying. Yeah they're too mouthy. Mouthy me likey... Well, what you likey does not matter because it's not your fucking turn anymore! Then fucking pick someone or we'll pick for you. No no no, that's not how the game works Dick! You got to pick yours I got to take mine, let him pick his. Oh! I got it. Who is it? Her. This one's gonna be fun! I'm giving you to the count of three to give me a sign, or I'm g oing back there and snatching your ghostly ass out of that Void myself! Did you just see that? That was an orb that just went cross me! you know the ghost man and I'm diving right in! People call me, Ghost Man! I used to be scared of the dark but now I fight the dark! One man, one ghost! Cause this is just between me and you, this is between the ghost and the ghost man I am the Ghost Man - Hello? What's up puddin' cup? Don't call me that. Whoa whoa whoa, did I just catch somebody admiring her big bro on basic cable Public access. Ahh, admit it, that's without a doubt the best showmanship you've ever seen in your life! It's three in the morning. Right, I need you to shoot for me tomorrow, well, later on today around noon. I can't I'm filling out job applications all day- We're talking season finale here! The only way we make millions down the line is if we make the greatest piece of paranormal television in history! Grant Wilson, Jason Hawes, Zack Bagans, Jackie Washington, and the Ghost Man! Okay fine but after this I have to find a real job- after this you won't have to! Dex- Call me ghost man. I am never calling you ghost man I'll see you tomorrow. Today, later today, Ghost Man out Get up grandma, we got to get goin'! How, how did you get in? Had keys made just in case. Here put that on. I know you're welcome. Look, we have to get going, I mean I'm jacked, clacked and ready to rat-a-tat-tat- What's up? What? I know that look, that is the same look I give myself every single morning when I look into the mirror. That's the look of someone who's been seeing things What? You know, things. Have you been seeing them? No. But you would tell me if you have right? No! Because that would be the greatest show ever! No! Listen, Dex, leaky pipes and mice in the ceiling are actually leaky pipes and mice! You wouldn't even be interested, I promise. But- you would tell me if you have right? Let's go. Three years ago in this location a giant sinkhole 300- again one more time one more time. April 25th 2012 a day that will live in infamy a ginormous sinkole 400 feet deep opened up and swallowed six young children into a deep abyss never to be seen again. Now the locals call this a portal to Hell and all I know is I'm diving right in and today we're with the property manager Mr. Peter Barrett. Mr. Barrett welcome... to man vs. ghost! Thank you. You're welcome Peter. Now we have spoken to a lot of the local residents who claim they have seen ghostly childlike apparitions in this very hallway. Yeah, it's been a while since I've heard anything you know last folks had called me out here claims that they saw some movement right over here in these windows. You know kind of kind of low down, ya know, just creeping along, you know, kind of like they was kids But... just ended up being this cute little tabby cat and, uh, that's when we met. Brought her in, named her Deb, she sleeps with me every night now Just let us in. You got it partner. Tonight's the night ladies and gentlemen where I enter the most haunted most dangerous location ever investigated in the history of Man vs. Ghost. This is where I leave my production crew behind this is where I go one-on-one. This... is where it becomes Man vs. Ghost. Have a good time. Cut! Cut, cut - What the hell was that? What? What? Nothing, just never mind we've got it from here Okay, good luck on your ghost adventure. Thanks Little help? Well I'm here all night, but Jackie do me a favor. This time, please have the Ghost Van back promptly at 7:00, I do need a ride. Do I have to keep the magnet on? Why would you even ask me that? Wait. If you actually are seeing something which I don't believe you are, but if you are, take this, and try to capture it on video I mean it would help to show out a lot. Ghosts don't exist. But if they do exist it makes sense that they would follow the sister of the greatest ghost hunter alive! See ya. Well be safe It is 3:00 in the morning- You sound stressed, you didn't just have a paranormal experience did you? What is it? Cause you should tell me if you did- What is it? The school's a bust, not even a damn stray cat I mean the ghost man can stretch a show but even I've got my limits. So? I made some moves and I've scored the interview of a lifetime, are you ready for this? Dr. Joseph Webb! Wow the Dr. Webb... Now I know you don't keep up with the world of paranormal science but this is Season Finale material here! I need you on this one sis. Okay fine I'll help, you but if I keep helping you, I'm the one that's gonna end up needing help. I'll take it but here's the thing, the only time Dr. Webb can fit me in his schedule is 7:00 a.m. and it's a three-hour drive so can you come pick me up right about now? Fine I I can't sleep anyways- Wait... are you having a paranormal experience right now? Bye Dex. Wait wait! Wake up! Dex! Call me Ghost Man. I'm not calling you Ghost Man! Fine, just tell me what's going on. I just haven't been getting much sleep is all And... And? And... Fine, okay fine... Do you think that they follow us home? Look, they don't follow me they don't follow you. Reality of the situation is we just got one more episode to finish after we finish that episode then we finish the entire season then we take that finished season sell it to the Travel Channel and then with all that money you can buy five bodyguards to watch you freaking sleep at night. Do you even know who lived in your apartment before you? No- it could be the damn Zodiac killer for all we know. Is he even dead yet? When the Ghost Man goes out he needs to know everything there is to know about the paranormal sciences so I go out and find the best I find the smartest I find sometimes the craziest but the point is I find the best so tonight to take this journey into that dark void with me is the man whose radical new theory The Ripple Effect is taking the paranormal world by storm. Dr. Joseph Webb. Doctor, Thank you, and welcome to Man vs. Ghost. Doctor, uh, Dr. Webb will you explain your radical new theory. Dr. Webb I mean- Well, well, uh, people have energy or rather energy has people. Every person in this universe has a specific set of energy that suggests a lot about their personality or past and possibly their future. Your energy for example is... very... purple. Intriguing. Well, I'm not surprised about that because... most of the apparitions I've encountered over the years think I'm some sort of royalty. Of course...um... well anyway when a person loses a part of themselves to some sort of trauma they lose part of their energy as well Imprinting! Yeah! Yes you you are so very purple. Yes um, imprinting! Well for your viewers out there imprinting is what many refer to as the root cause to what the layman would refer to as a haunting. According to my ripple effect theory when a person imprints on their surroundings it not only affects the future but also... the past. So you're saying that a haunting can actually take place before the actual event that caused a haunting Precisely. If I throw a pebble in a stream does it not ripple backwards as well as forwards? So if I'm hearing you correctly you're saying that I could meet my future self in some sort of this ghost echo? Yes... but beware if you do, because it means something terrible is going to happen. Something you, you, you can't possibly avoid because it's already happened in the future, and you're merely observing an echo. That, is awesome! I mean take a second think about it Ghost Man versus Ghost Man! Battle of the century! And according to Dr. Webb that is actually possible! Thank you Doctor Webb, have you been absolutely brilliant! Thank you Dr. Webb. You. You don't believe me, I could tell you don't. What, what if everything I said is true, what, what if everything I've said today is true, and you just ignore it? What if you could save a human life because of my theory but no you just don't want to think about it I want you to think about it I want you to believe! What was that about? Nothing just let's get going Grab the gear! Let's let the doctor get some rest sis come on. Come on! I'm going to Sensabaugh Tunnel tomorrow for the final investigation- Hey! What! I said I'm going to the Sensabaugh Tunnel tomorrow for the final investigation now are you gonna shoot the intro? He was looking at me- He wasn't looking at you I told him to say that at the end just to freak the audience out. Really? Tomorrow? Can't sleep anyways- Yesssss! You... what what if everything I said is true what what if everything I've said today is true you just ignore it. What if you could save a human life because of my theory but no you just don't want to think about I want you to think about it I want you to believe Wake up! whoa whoa it's me sis your big bro I must have passed out. Look, I did some digging no violent crimes whatsoever have been committed near or even around your building Wait, what? That's right you're a big bro did some checking in just for you No, you did this because you wanted to do a show If you would just tell me what's going on I will leave you alone. Okay fine but no show and don't poke! I think... there's something in my apartment I knew it! Details! Uhh, well, I've been, I dunno, I've been having these dreams lately a few nights ago I had one that was so intense that I woke up and there was someone standing in my door frame Whoa whoa whoa you saw a full-blown apparition? Well no I mean it's night terrors it's a common thing to see but the blood- Spontaneous ectoplasmic generation? We got to do a show on this! Are you kidding me- Look you need to sleep I need a show all we have to do is switch apartments for one night that's it! No. Fine. You can still stay at my apartment tonight if you want to I mean I'll be up all night at the tunnel doing the last episode. I'll drop you off on the way Your place? Well if you're going to apply for a real job tomorrow you need your rest. But what about the show? I'll just set up a tripod don't you worry about it I'll drop you off on the way Okay, thanks Dex. Call me Ghost Man. Put some damn clothes on I'll see you in the car. Here we are - che' Ghost Man. Wait! This is a rough part of town, so if anything hectic happens there's some personal protection in the top drawer. Not the bottom drawer! The top drawer next to the bed, Okay? Buh-bye. I want to apologize to my sister Jackie Washington but Jackie this is for your own good! - you don't believe me, I can tell you don't! I want you to think about it- I need, I need a cab. 1426 Love Station Road. No, now! Right now! There it is again! For you at home you know me by now and this is what I, no, we have been waiting for! Class 1 spontaneous ectoplasmic generation! What the hell are you doing? You're walking around with a loaded freaking gun waiting for anything that moves you can shoot it down and for what? A stupid ghost show? I can't take this anymore Look, Dex I'm out okay I I don't need this stress in my life okay I can't sleep I can't eat and you might be able to handle it but not me okay I honestly don't care what you do with the show I don't want any part of it I can't take it anymore and I can't take you. That all I wanna do was to help. I just wanted to help and then all this happen I wanted to do is just help my brother I just wanted to help him and this is the thanks I get! I told ya I hope you at the TV show that's fine that's not a big deal I didn't think it would be all of this! I wanted to help, I tried everything I could I put up with him No not this again! Leave me alone I just wanted to help my brother What are you? Leave me alone! STOP! Stop stop please! Just leave me alone! Why are you doing this? Just go away! This show was the only thing that he had done... I haven't done a single thing to you! This is it! My own sister, and camera operator Jackie Washington has lost her mind. But when I show them this, they'll see that she's telling the truth Jackie, you will be okay. Well, go ahead bleed Police, open up! Is everyone okay? Open up I'm gonna come in! It's real... One last warning! It's real... Ommphf! Hey! Excuse me, hello I'm locked in. where ever...where ever I am. Hey, uh, hey man. Uh, hey sir, I'm very confused I'm sorry I'm not sure where I am. Um. Can you help me? Or... are you okay? AHHHH!!! Open the door! Someone help me! No one's gonna help. Well didn't you open the door. I can't open it I didn't put us here in the first place. Look, just, tell me your name. I'm Jessica. okay Jessica I'm Elliot Elliot O'Neill Okay Elliot why are we locked in this room? I don't know really exactly Hey do you know what day it is? There has to be a way out of here- There's not okay I've tried. How long have you been here? I don't know really. What is this place? I mean we've obviously been kidnapped or something. Where are we? What the fuck is going on!? I don't like just sitting here, feels like I'm waiting for something bad to happen to me. Can you talk to me? About what? I don't know, anything. I don't like uncomfortable silences when I'm not locked in a fucking dungeon so... I don't know... talk about something. I...uh...was never very good small talk. Great, I'm trapped in a room with a boring guy. Okay Chatty Cathy, umm, what do you do like for a job or whatever. Uh, I'm an Account Manager for a cell phone company. Wow. Okay well that sounds shitty. Yeah... it is, actually. How long you been doing that? Um, I don't know, like three years. That's two years longer than I've ever held any jobs. Why stay if you don't like it? I don't know I mean it's what you do, right? I mean sometimes I think I do it just to be around people I don't, uh, exactly get out as much anymore... I mean I used to. I used to have friends that went places. but somewhere along the line I just kind of... stopped. Why? I don't know I just sort of stopped having anything to talk about. I mean everything was fine pretty much, technically. I just didn't really have anything else to say. you know friends or coworkers, family. I don't know when that happened. I don't know when I stopped knowing how to be around people. Like I stopped being me. I just kind of gave up. I just kinda let myself get lost in the shuffle. Well that's your thing isn't it? I mean it's fucking obvious. What's obvious? You just gave up again, right now. I mean listen to yourself you pussy you just gave that entire 'woe is me' speech in past tense like like that's it that's my life. Well you know what Elliot? Sounds like a shitty life and I'm sorry but it's not mine. I have lots of friends and I love my life and I love my family. I'm sorry but I'm not just gonna sit here feel sorry for myself. Jeez, why are you getting so angry? I'm sorry if I get pissed listening to your self-defeating bullshit! I'm not dead yet so I'm sorry if I don't join your little pity party. I want to survive this and I want to get the fuck out of here! You can't get out! What part of that do not get? Hey we're not doing that! I'm not doing this all right? What is the fucking for? Elliot what is the fucking knife for? They... they want us to kill each other. What do you mean? It doesn't matter cause I'm not doing it! Let us out! Hey! How do you fucking know that! I just do, alright? Come on, open up please! I'm not... I don't want to do this! I'm sorry Elliot. What? Please, stop! Please! Please, you don't have to do this. Oh I don't want to. but I think I have to. No! No, no! AHHH!! AHHHH! AHHH- I want to thank you. First, I don't know why you attacked me I didn't think people would sacrifice others like that, not really. But I get it now. You didn't attack me because you wanted to kill me but because you wanted to live. I can't blame you. For a long time I live my life on social media. Looking at pictures of mountains but never climbing any. The truth is I put myself in this room. long before anyone else did. I refused to do that now I am going to survive I want to live. I want to see those mountains up close I want to have conversations with people that don't involve likes replies or comments passed off as insight I want to live. And I know whoever comes through that door is gonna want to to take it all away from me. I will be a wave breaking against rocks on the seashore I will move through them AHHH! And no matter what I will earn my life. Is he... talking to himself? Wait what? Is he talking to himself, the gingery guy? Oh yeah. Does he do that a lot? Yeah I mean wouldn't you? Do you ever like feel bad for these people? Yeah, sometimes. Sometimes... I feel like I'm an instrument in the perpetuation of inhumane cruelty passed off as entertainment and sport. But then I just go get my paycheck on Friday go get shithouse moused at Hooters By Sunday I forget all about these me these mother fuckers. AHHH! Get my out of here! Now, I'm done! I'm done!
