"Bellri's Fierce Charge" The Megafauna has entered an elliptical orbit. Main nozzles, cut. Check the bulkheads. Take care of meals and personal needs now. The Capital Army are close enough to attack us at any time. Halfway around Earth, and some guys are sure to come from the Capital Tower. The Under Nut is okay. La Vie en Rose is a guardian angel, huh. Captain Dellensen is leaving. All right, the Gs on this rocket launch are quite severe. I'm ready. - Roger. - Got it. The Capital Army will attack at any moment. All pilots, hurry to your stations. I'm on it! Noredo. Huh? What is it? My G-Self will ride the Fry-Schop connected to the right side of the hangar. Oh, we can return to the Capital Tower if we sneak in. That's right. Raraiya, we should go pee. Look at what they're loading onto the G-Self. It's a Reflector. That was also built by Ameria's best engineers at the Caribbean Ocean Laboratory. It's a Reflector that deflects beams. And they couldn't put one on my Montero! Don't be hitter, Lieutenant. We're counting on you, kid! It's like you're using me as a guinea pig! You may be facing a full-scale space battle, so we strengthened your defenses. Okay! The controller for the Reflector is external, so check the manual on how to use it. It's external? We combined things that were created separately. Yes! Thank you. Did they sneak aboard the Fry-Schop? Captain Dellensen, Director Wilmit has approved of the operation. - Great. - Please look after my son Bellri. Leave it to me. Now... Stowing arms in the rear. The Gironde Team will come from below. I'll come from above to rescue Bellri and the two others. You got that, Gironde Team? The problem is that the pirate ship's increasing its altitude more than we-- Now the Reflector is activated, and in every direction... Since they gave you the Reflector, 1 expect you 10 act as my shield. You can hear me over the contact link ? Don't get pulled in by Earth's gravity. Come on, get in further. The Captain wants the G-Self to intercept the enemy at this altitude. This is already a military operation. G-Self, go ahead to starboard. Make sure to ride us. Roger. Arcane, taking off. They're definitely used to being in space. But I'll try to reach to the Capital Tower with the Fry-Schop. G-Self, are you reading us over the contact link? Yes, 1 read you! Bellri's here. We know you're good at this. Make sure nothing goes wrong, okay? Roger. We're going to close in on them while facing the Capital Tower. Roger that, but... The pirate ship's launched F-Rugs! Do they plan to shoot down the EIf Bull? Yes. We'll divert their attention with a missile barrage... - Will they reach? - We'll go up. Radio is jammed! I can't believe this! Five unknowns are closing in from below us. Steer! Expect long-range missiles from the Capital Tower as well! Yes, sir! So putting on a flashy show here IS our mission. Yes. In the meantime, Ameria's main unit can do orbital flight training. I see how it is. Miss Aida, don't keep going out in front. Roger, Captain. What's going on? A diversion? Communications got cut off. You know there's something approaching from the Capital Tower, yeah? I'm concerned that it's not a ship. Are you trying to use up our propellant before the battle starts? She stood up! - G-Self! - It jumped? In order to photograph the other side of the northern hemisphere... Deployment confirmed. Activate camera. 1 can see them! Five ships above the hemisphere! These are the warships' silhouettes. It's the Amerian Army's space fleet. They're in an elliptical orbit. G-Self, unknown inbound from above! This piece of metal is a storage medium... Saving data... It worked! They've dispersed Minovsky particles? Prepare intercept missiles to fire in all directions! I can finally reach the force coming from below. Darn Capital Army! All right, we'll support Captain Dellensen. Side nozzle, fire, fire, fire! No... we've reached the Doubey's max altitude! The Minovsky particles were spread by the one above! What the heck?! The Reflector deflected the beam? I'll support Bellri fighting up above. You people go protect the Megafauna! One machine came from the pirate ship. The silhouette is different on camera, but that's the G-Self! Is it completely under pirate control now? You're trying to ram me?! Where's their Fry-Schop? Do you have any idea how many of my comrades you've Killed?! The Reflector is functioning. Then...! That should have been a direct hit! You monster! To think the Capital Army constructed a thing like that... Mom, you're way too ignorant of what the Capital Army is doing! G-Self, you're being pulled by the Earth! From another direction?! That beam... Is it the G-Self?! Lieutenant, kick him away with your legs! Did Bellri ram him?! Direct circuit connection. He's fast! But...! I pulled off the full guard. Capital Army...! What?! I can't believe the Capital made such a thing. That voice... You're Cadet Bellri? That voice was Instructor Dellensen? It's because you brought out that new model! Because you transformed with that thing! Because you resorted to cheap tricks like that...! What happened to Lieutenant Klim? He should be falling. Is that him? I-I'm falling. The controls don't work. How long can this machine hold? Internal temperature is rising. For me, dying in vain isn't an option! What? What's that light? The cooling gas's barrier is perfect. Lieutenant, are you okay? I'm fine. I'm cutting off the cooling link. Did the Doubey team down below just arbitrarily decide to retreat? Those guys took their F-Rugs to their limits. 1 see. 1 suppose you're right. This is ridiculous! It couldn't have been him! What are you doing, boy? Turn on braking thrusters! Oh, right! I'll do the rest. Don't do anything unnecessary. Both the Montero and the G-Self have been damaged! It's impressive they came back like that. - It's because it's Bellri! - Huh? What? Where did you come from? Who are you? If I don't see for myself how good you are, I'll be worried sick when things get tough. Why you! Chuchumy. Lieutenant. We've opened Bellri Zenam's image data. Is it a large transforming mobile suit? Yes. This came from the Under Nut, right? Bellri Zenam said the pilot was his instructor. Instructor? From the Capital Guard academy... Instructor Dellensen always looked after Bell. Then this was a prototype? It's already been mass-produced. Miss Noredo. Yes? Please let Bellri rest. Yes. Can you stand? That's it. It could be a laser net. If you're sick, throw up. Oliver, what's your take? Raraiya, a bag. The Capital Army's breaking the technology taboo. A terrible turn of events. Steady. Yes! Okay, Steer! Everyone's laughing. You're being praised as a princess yet you can stand like that. 1 admit you have some talent, but we'll fix that arrogant attitude in the Pirate Corps. Mind your own business! If you don't fix it, I'd be too scared to propose to you. Allow me to tell you the truth about myself. In fact, I am a Kuntala, just like you. What? What is a Kuntala? 1 hear that it referred to a class of inferior people used as food in 2 past era. If we produce results as the Garanden's Mask Corps, the Kuntala's position will improve. And then, we could even rule the Capital Tower! That's right! - The Mask Corps'... - ...Elf Bullock team... ...Will crush the space pirates! Another hot day. Good morning. Oh, good... Nice work yesterday. Thank you. Sure. Good morning. Morning. Bellri Zenam, we're putting the G-Self to work. What? Work? What do you mean? If you go there, you'll be in the way! You can't! You can't! What's up? - Lower the machine gun. - Right Keep on lowering it! Keep going! Good! Raraiya stubbornly insisted on taking a nap with the G-Self! Hey, boy! Your job is done here. Okay, I'll be leaving then. He's got his spirit back. That Raraiya girl... If she feels a sense of familiarity with the G-Self... Oh. Hey, it's inflating. It turns into a Megafauna? Welcome. - Let's eat first. Then work. - The First Nut. Coriole... is equipped with facilities for space life. - We can finally feel comfortable. - Gained weight? It's not inertial gravity. Thanks for your regular patronage. Thank you, too. Letting things like that into town! Good day. Give them the largest hall? It's an order from the Capital Government. Curse you, Jugan! Why make the nut a military base? I can't approve this. - Here you are. - Thank you. We're just transporting ration, water and air balls, you know? Commander, we've located the space pirate ship. Can you see the Megafauna? - Pirate ship? - Yes, this is it. The image isn't clear... It's blurry! The atmospheric layers are thick, so correcting doesn't work. Bell is there! What is it? E-Excuse me. As Operations Director, I've been wanting to see the pirate ship myself. - Pardon me. - It's fine. This isn't it? - Becker. - Yes? Deploying a Gondwan warship to the advance base... Commander Jugan is quick-thinking. But... This is a job that Colonel Cumpa arranged. You're joking, right? Even if we've finished maintenance on the guns, our supplies from the homeland only just arrived, right? They said to move up the schedule for getting the fleet into satellite orbit. Still... Under these circumstances, we've no choice but to do a decoy operation. What are the Montero and G-Self doing on that? Lieutenant Klim is adjusting its connection to the Belay. 1 see. That's Klim Nick for you. Chuchumy... Chuchumy and 1 both want to see it. To see you pilot this machine. Pilot? Canldoit? Chuchumy... Yes, you can. - I can use this... - Captain, the door is open! That's an atmospheric glider! Director, what are you doing? It's of historical value. Such things must be maintained in working order. Could a glider that only goes down be of any use? We could use it for recon and such. It's closing! Captain, take shelter in the airlock! L-Like this? It's opening! That old lady... Oh, no! It's opening! It's opening! Why? Why did it open? Ah, so you can move it. You did it. We're changing the G-Self's direction. Who's doing that? Miss Raraiya Monday. Chuchurny and 1 are watching you. Watching? The enemy is on the other side of this island! The EIf Bullocks will perform a beam saber oscillation test. Unknown flying objects detected! What?! Gisela! Check their position relative to the dummy balloon. There's an alert! Good, Raraiya, my dear. Now can you try holding the shield? Shield? Shield... [ ate! - What?! - What?! Bell! What?! Hey! They say the G-Self's gone out too! Huh?! What does that mean? Mid-air transformation! Too slow! So they're coming from the other side of the island? I'll head out in the Arcane. Do we have a machine for Bellri Zenam to pilot? The Jahannam on the Ladle out on the deck should be usable! But should we let him? You've seen what he's capable of. Bellri Zenam! Bell! - Yes! - Yes! Run to the Jahannam on the deck! She's bullying you! The Ladle's pilot is Ginger! - Go! - Right! This is as far as you go! -Tll go! - We're counting on you! Bellri Zenam, get aboard! - Okay! - Good to go! Hey! It's Universal System compliant. You should be able to use it. Protect the ship! Just leave it to me! It'll be another two or three years before I can say that. Bellri, was it? We re heading out! Is that true? Get your machine back in position. I heard Lieutenant Klim saying "Raraiya, my dear," in syrupy tones. Raraiya's in the cockpit? The force attacking from the west is the Capital Army, right? The Capital Army doesn't have maritime forces. Well, they're here now! Raraiya, dear! Crouch down! You could fall! A flash! There's flashing! Raraiya! Which of them went down? There was a flash! Chuchumy! So you've come, G-Self! Are you going to transform? That machine the Captain failed to capture still hasn't been fully investigated by us! I-I'll drown! I'll sink! Chuchumy! She can't control it at all! Go limp! I'll go save Klim's Montero. Roger that Rara-- Bell! Bell! Rin! Rin! Rin! Ah. Chuchumy wants to see outside, doesn't she? Outside? She looks happy, doesn't she? It has red eyes. Excuse me, could you take care of this girl? Sure, but what about you? I'll go help the Lieutenant and Miss Aida. I won't let a wounded prey escape! I can't get away! A new model's coming to help him? The Capital Army had a whole formation waiting? You Amerians think of yourselves as elites! He's aiming at me! This is bad! Klim! 1... I'll be taking this. 1 got cut! C-Captain Mask! So you've emerged from the ocean, G-Self? Use the booster! Bellri Zenam? Like this?! - Miss Aida, we'll intercept them. - Right. The G-Self isn't something a pirate should be allowed to use! The G-Self fell from the sky! Think about what that means! A barrier?! But I just need one more push to capture it! What? Amerian Army reinforcements? Princess, the Armorzagan is here! Father has even developed new weapons like that? But... It saved our lives. Is that an Amerian mobile armor? Even so, that force isn't wiped out yet. Bell must be somewhere on that island. Head behind the island where the Armorzagan came from! 1 can hear you. Chuchumy. Go sit in back. Bellri's doing well. Amerian Army F-Rugs? That's the Jahannam 1 rode here. They're trying to land when there are enemies? Who's the pilot? This F-Rug, too... Supplies from the homeland, huh? Lieutenant, I've brought weapons! Inspector General? You came here?! - Chuchumy! - The Jahannam's hatch opens? - It does. - Fine then. Raraiya! The enemy's tough! Anything you can do, we can do too! That pilot's fending them off well. Father! Oh, Tm glad to see you're well. "Father?" Chuchumy! She's cute, huh? Cute. Her father... Isn't he the Amerian Army's Inspector General? He's the guy at the top. Your Arcane fell into the sea? I still can't make full use of its capabilities. 1 see. What are you doing here at the front lines? You're asking why? - Excuse me. - Yes? You must be Bellri Zenam. Oh, I'm not going to join the Amerian Army. I don't mind. What? But in return... Let us switch out backpacks for you. Goetz, back up the Armorzagan with the Jahannam. Twill Is this what you call the regular army? Lieutenant, how long to exchange the G-Self's backpack? We'll hold out until the G-Self launches! I'm counting on you! Lieutenant, but the Montero is... 1 can believe that. For engineers, it's the truth. Use the external control panel with the G-Self's hands! What?! 1 can't do it from the cockpit? The connectors match, right? Well, it looks like they should! Hurry up, Bellri Zenam. Phew. Bellri, was it? Come forward! Okay, next! Okay, final form! Got it! There's beams and missiles. I'm falling here! B-But... My legs! You can get down using the wire your leg just brushed. Are you all right? I'm fine! The Tricky Backpack unfolds rearwards, too. Raraiya! Inspector General Gusion, look after Raraiya for me. Bell, here's a rifle. It took off. Because it's using the Tricky Pack. Can you stay calm over there, Raraiya? You can't do this. I'm flying too. Miss Aida, protect your father. I-I'm sorry! Father's? Decelerate. Brake. Reverse thrusters. Land! Lieutenant, you're taking too long! My apologies, Mick Jack. Did he target me?! 1 need to withdraw! Are that mobile suit and armor working in tandem? What is that machine? Captain Mask! The backpack gets in the way of the rifle! Oh, no! Mick Jack! Your attacks are sloppy! You're letting them get away! I'll bet the Lieutenant is complaining. The beams won't focus! You're pretty uppity for a flimsy little board! I can't win in melee combat without raising my altitude. Are you giving me support? If I can use a booster, I'll take down the G-Self here while it's still unaccustomed to the pink backpack. I can't get it to stabilize! Get it together! The enemy still hasn't fled yet! Weren't you supposed to be protecting your father? There's an unknown approaching from the direction of the Capital Tower. An unknown? An unidentified machine coming this way? The Belay my father's on detected it with its camera. You can stop dragging the dummy balloon. Support us with the Fry-Schop. - Roger/ - Where is the unknown? Miss Aida, you're being reckless! Are you people just messing around? Your enemy is right here! A balloon! We couldn't stop him. There was no way a balloon could have. A balloon? Did this girl say "balloon"? The one coming from the direction of the Capital Tower is glider-size? Yes. You're open! It took down the system! But that's only temporary! Well done, Mick Jack! You too, Lieutenant. I saw that bulky pink G-Self let one get away. The balance on this backpack... Ah! Miss Aida! Having a fit? That would be Miss Aida. - Mick! Go after him! -Ican't! Both our machines are in bad shape. Where's Miss Aida? I can't see her on the telescopic monitor. Where is she? I see her! The fins' output...! Why?! They're overloading! I'm at a much higher altitude than the thing from the Capital Tower! My radar! The G-Self is right below me! Is the unknown going to slip under me as well? The unknown is an atmospheric glider. It's coming to me! Bell! Bell! Bell! Where's Bellri?! - What?! - Where are you? - Bell! - Huh?! It's your mother! My mother?! There's one glider. Where's Miss Aida? If my machine stabilizes, I can take it down in one... Don't shoot it! - You're getting in my way! - That's my mom! - Huh? -T'll stop it! Use the reverse thrusters! You can brake, right? But...! But...! But...! But...! So you're doing okay then? It was a Capital Tower emergency escape glider. Those are defenseless. 1 nearly became a murderer. Huh? That's Bellri Zenam's mother? Mom. You really did come down here alone in that glider. Icame in a hurry, so I forgot to buy a cinnamon cake. I thought the Crown timetable was all you ever thought about. When things like this happen, yes, I worry for you a little. That's a mobile suit from the pirate ship, right? Bellri Zenam, do you read me? Yes, Aida Surugan. We've checked for enemies. Let's return to the Megafauna. R-Right. Why was the Arcane at such a high altitude? 1 was checking for any enemies aside from the glider. Thank you for that I lied. Raraiya! It's fine! Lower your guns! It's the Crown Operations Director. The Operations Director is Wilmit Zenam... His name is Bellri Zenam, right? It's been since the Mettabal International Conference, hasn't it? You look well, Inspector General. Might that be your daughter? Yes, I am Aida Surugan. I heard about your situation before coming down here. 1won't apologize for how you were treated at the Capital Tower. Of course not. I'm very sorry. For our space technology, we've also borrowed from Gondwan, our enemy of the past 10 years. However, we have no connection to the Rose of Hermes Blueprints. What about the spaceship that led SU-Cordism to condemn you for taboo breaking? You mean the Nick Space, on which we halted construction? Yes. That was dismantled. It should've been no issue at the international conference. If the Nick Space is now the Megafauna, then yes, it would be an issue. And how do you know it is? Many of the things on this ship, have manufacturer names and production dates on them. You used the Megafauna's data to construct a space fleet, ves? If we know that an attack is coming from space... We will be taking our leave. For maintenance and security. Please, do. Have your mommy let you suckle her breasts. That's rude! No more slingshot at me, okay? What's his problem? Please take a look at this. Were these photographs taken from Ameria? Astronomical observation violates the taboo! There's intense human activity around the moon. The work of the Kashiba Mikoshi, which brings us photon batteries, is the pulse of the universe itself. This is the Kashiba Mikoshi. The number of other objects has increased in recent years. The threat around the moon-- The reason that SU-Cordism distributes photon batteries to the Earth, is to help the surviving humans on Earth to rebuild. No matter what may happen, The Capital Tower will stand rising into the sky! Mom, calm down. Bell, Miss Noredo, and Miss Raraiya. Let's go back to the Capital Tower. Mom, don't be ridiculous. There are plenty of things we could ride. We'll be crushed! That's the commander's machine. His name's Captain Mask, right? Reservists, pick up the fragments that fell on the deck! Don't miss a single screw! 1 thought, if I came to the front lines, I might be able to find out where Luin, Noredo and Bell were. Half of them were shot down. That's Kuntala for you. Kuntala will be Kuntala. Don't panic. I'll pass on your request to the chief of operations. Take a rest for tonight. Okay, troops, face right! Yes, sir! Each of you take what you picked up to the collections box. Huh? That's Luin Lee, isn't it? Are they that happy to see a Kuntala fail? U-Using me like a guinea pig... You... I-I'm a Kuntala too! The shame of this defeat... 1 must clear myself of it as Captain Mask. Y-Yes, sir! We Kuntala have our pride as well. Let me see that through for now. Yes, sir! I'll be cheering for you, Captain Mask! Thanks! Luin is Mask. We're going back to the homeland. Be careful in your return to the Capital Tower. There'll be more commotion if you guys are around. 180 degree turn! All hands, all baggage is secured, right? Fixing course. Keeping her steady. Is the Lieutenant Klim returning home due to orders from the president? Mick's Armorzagan lost the enemy that was tailing her. Very well. No, it's for matters related to an operation. Is this setting correct? It's fine. The Director's headed out? Did you say something? I said it looks like this'll be fun. I haven't dressed like this in ages! Bell! Mom! This is just between us, but... Yes? 1 hear Bell was a foster child. What? You mean he was adopted? I don't know the truth. That hurt! - Raraiya! - Danger! Danger! Don't scare me! Come back over here! - Is everything okay? - Yeah. It's a long distance call, isn't it? You realize the fees for those are high, right? Here, keep the change. Don't go over 20 minutes. Um, there's eleven in here, right? Could we have all of them? - Huh? - We'll give you a good price. The fish in the pen over there are for sale too, right? H-Hold on @ moment. I'll go get the calculator. Oh, my. No! Don't eat Chuchumy! - Ms. Kiran! - She's got it wrong! Ms. Kiran, you're a nurse. You should understand about Miss Raraiya. My Bell, and Aida Surugan. Why is there so much turbulence? We're going at a low speed, so the wind shakes us. 1 fine... Can we break through the Capital Army's surveillance on this course? When 1 was on the phone earlier, I called for the Capital Guard to come meet us. We can avoid the Army's eyes. Don't cry. I'll give you milk. He wants all hands to stay on alert and ready for combat. Isn't that weird? Since we've got you people here. And the Operations Director of the Capital Tower is aboard as well. This is the Capital Territory, so it's enemy ground. Quit talking about enemies! This is our town! I-I'm sorry, Miss Noredo Nug. My... What a polite way to refer to me. How kind of you. Kind of you. Kind of you. This waterfall looks like it's in slow motion. - The water doesn't reach ground level. - What?! So no plunge pool. As expected from a regular pilot. They've spread Minovsky particles. Steer, make a clean getaway for us! Aye, aye, madam! - Is it the Capital Army? - I'm sorry. Uh, no, it's fine. Where's Bellri? How useless 1 am! To think I'd chance upon you here. Now, 1 need despair no more, G-Self! Miss Aida! Gisela, do it! - Let's send out the Montero! - Accelerating! What?! The unmanned Montero? We'll handle the Montero's friend or foe identification by camera! It can use the javelins at least, right? Prepare to launch! Let's get on with it. Go! This guy again?! An unmanned mobile suit? G-Self! That leaves you open! I'll finish you off! Is this the end for me? Barara! Reinforcements! What? A person? 1f 1 can see a person, 1 can't shoot! You shouldn't be doing that! Barara! Make it! I can't see! You've slid too far! Take us back! There! Brake a bit! I said brake! Barara! Captain, we're withdrawing. Nicely done! Take us straight back to the Capital Tower! You'll need to bear with this for a while. I'll move to the cockpit later. Oh... Okay! First we should call Colonel Cumpa for backup! Pull back from the Megafauna! Act as if we were right under the Capital Tower. Mobile suits are to stay out there on combat alert. What about the Minovsky particles? They're starting to dissipate, so I'm worried! Fry-Schop, stay prepped for combat as well! G-Self, you suck! Huh? Is Bell that bad at this? Maybe he's just tired from fighting? Something's coming from below. Huh? What's coming, Mr. Luan? The Director is here, yes? That voice... Is that you, Instructor Kerbes Yoh? Oh, Cadet Bellri Zenam. You took back the G-Self! ...Is something I can't really say. Kerbes, thank you for your trouble. Did you recognize the F-Rug that attacked this ship? It's one of the Capital Army's. I saw it, but I don't know the details myself. Cadet Bellri, have you become an Amerian Army pilot now? The Amerians won't give me the first lieutenant, so I'm still a Capital Guard cadet. As I recall... You were the lady pirate, correct? Yes! Good of you to come. Yeah, if 1 get a call straight from the Director, of course Tm coming out! Along with some dummies to keep this ship from being detected! Huh? Is it that small? That's not the impression 1 got from the numbers. Can you control it? Take a measurement. Gisela, you too. Stow the fins. Fin, put back! Bridge passed. Good. Next is the timing for the landing. Okay. Hover brake! They're here. Kerbhes, 1 see you got to meet the Director. - She's right here! - Thank you for all your hard work. At the moment, we're carrying the new photon batteries, plus water and air balls. Father. Oh, it's the Biclover. My house is nearby. Want to come stay there? House? Stay? - You can stay. - And those trailers? Those trailers carry photon batteries to the airport to be distributed worldwide. Once the batteries are loaded, my mother's work is done. We should have just kept going. F-Rugs can't go near the Biclover. Well, the Capital Army are doing it, aren't they? The Army are like mobsters. They don't have my permission. Come on! Come on! Get off the Shanks! Dance! Dance! Looks like a society ruined by abundance. Working at the Capital Tower is hard. They need to let off steam once a week. Oh, come on. No! Yes. This is your ID Card, Miss Aida Surugan. Thank you. Mr. Gusion Surugan. Thank you. You weren't monitoring because it's the weekend? Is that 2 joke? Colonel! Can I call my boyfriend over? I've already told you. Do whatever you want! Tell Mask to take a rest. Yes. I want to arrange a meeting between Mask and Commander Jugan. What? Not until the weekend is over? Some Capital Army! These Earth people belong on the list of organisms that ought to go extinct. Have you just returned from your business trip? Yes. Your Holiness, I would like you to explain everything you know in regards to the coming threat from space. Ameria violated the taboo against astronomical observation... What my father wants to ask is whether there's someone coming from space. Throughout the Regild Century, photon batteries have been transported via the Capital Tower. That has allowed humanity to recover. But the batteries weren't made at the Capital Tower, correct? It's because of SU-Cordism's compassion that the surface has prospered as it does today. The photon batteries cannot be disassembled on Earth. That's why doing so was made taboo. That creates the evil of monopoly. - We in Ameria-- - Director Wilmit Zenam. I wasn't aware you had returned. Colonel Cumpa! Weren't you off for the weekend? And why is Inspector General Surugan with you? 1 have a question, Colonel Cumpa. The Rose of Hermes Blueprints... You're aware of their existence, yes? That's a rather fantastical name. I beg your pardon for the interruption. He's the fop of the Research Division and created the Capital Army... Cadet Bellri Zenam! There you are! What is it? Miss Aida as well! Yes. Ma'am, take care of my father. Aida Surugan! You'll trip! What? What did you say? Get to the Shanks. According to Amerian research, there's a space colony called Towasanga on the far side of the moon. Yes. The photon batteries are produced there, and the people that live there are planning to immigrate to Earth. That's why you planned to take His Holiness hostage and go up to Sankt Porto in your space fleet, right? You're imagining things. The way 1 understand it-- Pardon me. Is it true about this space fleet? I'm supposed to be off for the weekend, but Commander Jugan is calling me in. I want to go to Noredo's house! Looks like we can't. No! The Capital Army wants the Megafauna, the G-Self, and that Raraiya girl as well. Why? They must think she knows something about the threat from space. After all, she's a girl who fell from the sky! Here, I'll hold you. With the founding of the Capital Army, we, the Capital administration, are developing new weapons, of which this Wuxia is only one. Are always developing new suits. Senators, I hope for your continued understanding in this... - I'm not done. - For the prime minister...! We must utilize these new weapons! You've really packed stuff in here. 1 thank you for your work, Lieutenant. No need to curtsy to me. So she actually can say thank you... Bellri Zenam. - Hurry to the rear deck! -Yes! This way. - Noredo's house... - No, no. No, no. Pa. Miss Aida, I'd like you to escort the Megafauna. Do you mean I'm only a reserve pilot? The Inspector General is watching! He's not here right now. I left him with the Director. You left him with the Director? She's Bellri's mother. Huh? Where did you put the G-Self? It's right here! Where exactly is "here"? I don't see-- Hey! We took this one from the Capital Army. What did you take? This High Torque Pack for land combat. When they built the Wuxia, they made this at the same time. But it won't work with the Wuxia. Oh... So I thought about this thing. You've used a lot of backpacks, right? This isn't a game, Instructor. I'm not your instructor anymore. We're comrades in arms! Did you encounter Instructor Dellensen? Huh? He died in a battle. The Capital Army sent a very powerful machine. 1 got scared and almost died... You mean that new model? It transformed. The G-Self was so strong, 100, when 1 fought back. So 1 was saved. That's why?! 1 think so... The Capital Army has created something like this as well. Y-Yes... Next, they're trying to attack us with the Wuxia. Y-Yes... This time, use this in front of my eyes. Then I'll see it. The grade skipper's guts and skill! Yes...Mr. Kerbes... If I could use the atmospheric glider from the Under Nut... You can return to your country in no time. Can you persuade the president? Of course. Here you are. Thank you. I will go up to Sankt Porto on the last trip of the day. Are you sure? I do it every year. Well, will you go as well? Yes. - Hey! Hold on! - Again! - - Put her to bed! - Raraiya! - Whoa! - Launch, G-Self! Launch! Hey! Honestly... Huh? Launch! I'm ready to go out whenever! Are we relying on him too much? - What's the matter? - Raraiya is... Sorry. What happened to the G-Self? Ask the Lieutenant! Those kids are changing? Incoming! Incoming! Incoming! Incoming! Are they from the Capital Guard? Mobile suits, get into position to intercept. The Recksnows that just joined us are allies from the Capital Guard. They're wearing headbands, so you'll know. Lieutenant Kerbes, will you be protecting this ship, too? That's the Director's order as well. It's reassuring to have you. We really are grateful, Director. Yes. I'll be hanging up now. Later. What's Bellri doing? - Mr. Happa is making me wait. - Huh? Our objectives are to recapture the G-Self, and take Bellri Zenam and Raraiya Monday back into custody! Yeah! I'll show them what the Wuxia can do! Go, go, Wuxia! Take out that pirate ship! - How annoying. - Yes, it's me. If you've made contact with Mask, I'll take the last trip. Tell them to hop onto the bottom one. You see something? Yes... Is the Capital Army base on that side? You wanted to see it? Oh, of course not. We're right under the Capital Tower. Don't start anything yourselves. If the Catsiths and Doubeys can separate the Megafauna from the mobile suits... The Princess launched saying "The Capital Guard isn't enough!" That darned tomboy! I'll board the Megafauna with my Wuxia and get back the hostages! Wh-Where's the bridge? Darn! There?! Pirate ship captain, do you hear me? Hand over the G-Self, Bellri Zenam, and Raraiya Monday! Cease your resistance as well! How are we supposed to contact them when you've spread Minovsky particles? Stop them by yourselves by force! What? What's your problem? Wh-What? I'm trying to have a conversation here. So back off! Come on, they'll put a hole in your body. Beam rifle combat? For that girl. A normal suit. The Army has finally deployed the Wuxia? The Megafauna will get shot down! Darn you. What are you plotting? I'm ordering you to turn over Bellri and Raraiya! He's gonna... Stop that! That's Miss Aida's foot! Mr. Happa! Miss Aida, you shouldn't do anything reckless! - You in love with her? - That's not what this is about! This machine is similar to the G-Self. 1 must know more! Mr. Happa! The output's gone up! - It's gonna work! - Okay! Don't rush out and get killed! I've found love! I'm not gonna die! Turn on the hover to land! Where's Miss Aida? The Catsith. You people...! It shouldn't explode like that. Where's Miss Aida? Get off of me! 1 can see your hack! This is fun! This thing is good! This Wuxia the Capital Army developed... I'min love! Not enough output. What? Where's Miss Aida? There she is! Miss Aida's been caught! Something's snuck into the jungle! It's stronger than me! Everyone is fighting. I'll have to do this myself! Fly the High Torque Pack on its own... Are you mocking me?! What?! Get lost! I'm... I'm sinking! I'm impressed you don't get stuck in the bog considering your size. The leg sensors perform very well. It seems they can detect the firmness of the terrain. Brace for Gs. My wings were broken. I've prepared myself for it. Well then, well head back to the Megafauna. There are people from the Capital Guard on the Megafauna as well. Yeah. They must have issues with how the Capital Army operates. My mother will forgive me for going back there. G-Self and Arcane have returned! You should use the front deck. I know! No! Oh, shoot! Mr. Luan is mad! Bell, take those two inside. What? Raraiya's come out on the deck and is doing something. Have Adam Smith hurry up, Gisela. Roger. - Adam, bring in all the mobile suils. - Raraiva Monday... Huh? The Megaiauna is going into space. What...? Thanks to this backpack, I was able to live a little longer. But is it really... ...okay for these things to exist? - Princess! - Yes? We're bringing in the mobile suits. Oh, yes. Bellri Zenam, the Megafauna is going into space. Have the Garanden detach the left and right blocks. We'll rendezvous with Captain Mask's mobile suit corps in an elliptical orbit and defeat the space pirates! Then we will crush Ameria's space fleet and secure the safety of the Capital Tower. Joint release, all right! When His Holiness says he fears not what will come from space, but the people of Earth, that resonates with me. I must keep the operations on schedule, so if you'll excuse me... See to it that the Inspector General makes it home safely. Yes, Ma'am. Thank you. About the news from the Amerian state broadcast... State broadcast? The president is launching our space fleet? When did you come on board? I was in a hurry to get here, so I hopped into the last freight car. Why is the Research Division's colonel here? 1 was the one who procured the Garanden from Gondwan. It's my responsibility to oversee its operations. Before we enter elliptical orbit, fix any air leaks. Just fill any gaps with reinforcing coating. Be gentle! Stay still. No! Nobel, you tell us if Raraiya escapes. Tell you! They're heading to the Capital Tower with the Salamandra in the vanguard, right? Captain Klim Nick is the commander. We'll go to stop the Salamandra. What did you just say? Can we leave command in the hands of a young man who believes the Amerian space fleet belongs to him? He's President Nicchini's son, after all. Captain Cahill's operation to occupy the Capital Tower was from before the Capital Army was protecting it. That's right! No war in space! If you mean the news from Ameria's state broadcaster, then it's meant as a threat to the Capital Army. It has nothing to do with our tower. Will it really be all right? The nuts that carry the photon batteries are full of key industries I'm certain of it. Huh? Messame, taking off! Grivobal, nothing amiss. Barara, everything's good! Hatgezzen, following you now. All right, we'll rendezvous with the Garanden and crush the Amerian Army's pirate ship! What are those two ships? That's the Salamandra and Gavial from our fleet. The president sent his son in the advance party. Captain! Why didn't you shoot down that atmospheric glider just now? How could we when we just reached satellite orbit? This isn't some sort of game! Got it? We'll crush the Capital Army before our main space fleet comes. Yeah! Mick Jack is the second commander of this operation. Thank you! Once we make the Capital Tower a military base, the world will belong to Ameria! The Space Garanden is looking good, unlike when it was at sea. Fitting for a space battleship. -Coming in! - Roger. That Mask! To think he'd bring cutting edge machines all the way from the Capital Tower. 1 underestimated him. Was it in the Rose of Hermes Blueprints? Aren't they a bit smaller than you'd think? - Not exactly great looking though. - No effect on their performance. Captain Mask is back! Looks scary... With this Mack Knife, I'm prepared to wash away the shame of my repeated losses! Mask! - Recruits, do a deck check. - Yes, Sir! Colonel Cumpa and Commander Jugan seem unusually adept at arranging these things. If we leave so much as one screw, one piece of rubber packing, it could damage the mobile suits! You seem to have adjusted to your work here. Yes! Take care of sorting the containers that we brought with the Mack Knife. - Yes, sir! - Barara! There are two enemy ships at the moment. We'll assemble in the briefing room! Luin... I thought you were doing this in the name of Kuntala pride... If we, Ameria, can suppress the Gondwan Army by controlling the Capital Tower, we can improve the Capital Tower's monopolistic energy policy, and rule the world as the Amerian Empire... It's a parachute. Wh-What? From the glider? - It's Inspector General Gusion! - Inspector General Gusion Surugan. So this is Gusion-style. - It's Inspector General Gusion! - So he's still alive. The Inspector General used a parachute! Where have you been all this time? 1 went to confirm the facts that our highly capable spy agency has discovered. You? Yes. The Army and His Holiness are going up the Capital Tower. Then it's the perfect opportunity to occupy the Tower. Yes, that's true. But... Why hurry the launch of the fleet? My son Klim Nick launched according to your schedule. - What?! -Ican't let him die in vain. 1 have a duty to follow military orders! From the First Nut, Coriole. The Salamandra and Gavial are being chased by our Garanden and the pirate ship. Warn all mobile suits not to move away from the Capital Tower. Yes, sir! Oh. When did you arrive? 1 accompanied His Holiness. They'll sink Ameria's makeshift space fleet in no time, and humble President Zucchini's pride. If the Megafauna has also gone up info space... Bell has, too? - No, it couldn't be... - Your shoe magnets... Ah, Your Holiness. Oh, don't trouble yourself. Miss Aida has come up into space as well... The G-Self came down from space... It can't be! I raised Bell! I won't hand him over to others! 1 see. According to Inspector General Gusion, we can take the SU-Cordist pope captive in Sankt Porto as well. That's what he said, right? Yes, that seems to be the case. So he wasn't late just to be fashionable. Here they come. How amazing! This fleet can protect my boy Klim as he commands the Salamandra. We'll take an elliptical course to enter satellite orbit, from there we'll head to... To Sankt Porto at the steepest angle possible. That's absurd! While Captain Klim's advance party creates a diversion at the First Nut, if we get Sankt Porto and the pope, what will happen? We can take control of the Capital Tower. Miss Aida. What is it? You can't reach the Salamandra on your own. 1 have experience as a space pirate. Raraiya got away! Raraiya! - No! - How did you get loose? - Oh, my. - Huh? The Garanden has turned. Open hatches. In 15 minutes, the First Nut will appear on the horizon behind us. The Salamandra will send out mobile suits. Captain Mask, the pirate ship IS coming up, too. Roger. I'll take the G-Self from them. Wuxias and Catsiths, protect this ship. Mack Knifes, go attack! Roger. Right, Barara Peor, heading out! I've detected some activity on the enemy ship ahead of us. If I launch a preemptive attack on the Capital Tower, it'll make them divide their forces. And that'll make it easy for the main force to secure Sankt Porto, huh? Please do that I'll position the Hecate behind the Salamandra, and take on the guys who came from the Garanden! The force that came from the Garanden is acting strangely. What are they up to? They're coming from the First Nut, Coriole, too? Stop going straight. The Capital Army troops that came out of the First Nut. They're fast. But so am It Miss Aida, you can't go out. Princess, your job is to guard the Megafauna. Even you, Luan? If it's the Capital Army guys you're worried about, I'll stop them. -1, too, can... - Got it Bellri? Space backpack, roger. Thank you. Miss Aida, it's going to turn info a melee. If anyone comes out of it, snipe them from here. Oh, 1 see! 1 guess that makes sense. 1 can see the First Nut, Coriole. Do not damage that or the cables. Why aren't you shooting? Because our enemies and allies are all mixed together between us and the nut! We spread Minovsky particles because... even if you use the nut as a shield... we can take you out in close quarters combat! Sting like a bee! That's our genius, Klim! Mick. What about the force that launched from the Garanden? They came out in response to our moves. They're closing in on us! Where are they? Those Capital Army guys! Notify the force from the Capital Tower that we're allies. Mask, look in Earth's direction. There's a mobile suit coming from the direction of the pirate ship? Is this it? Hey, that's a Capital Guard Recksnow! What's the meaning of this? You'll be my shield! What? You launched from the pirate ship! And where's your machine from? You Capital Guard amateur! What's with this guy? Even the pirate ship ought to be able to read light signals. Light signals? What did the Capital Army mobile suit say? If you turn over the G-Self and Raraiya, we won't attack.” That's what they said. Huh? The G and Raraiya? What will you do, Bell? Fight? Or stop? It held! Even its fingers are beam cannons? Hey, G-Self! Surrender yourself to us. Say what? If you do so, I'll return Lieutenant Kerbes and his Recksnow. Who am I speaking with? A wire? If that had been a live round, you'd be dead. Your surrender is a sure thing now. If you hand over Raraiya Monday as well, we'll let the rest of you go. There's a mask under your helmet! Yeah, it's got built-in data files and sensors! Raraiya still hasn't recovered her memories! We know that! I'm gonna Kick that Mask guy right out of here! You're open! Oh, no! Luan? Oliver? No matter where 1 go, the grade skipper gels in my way! Barara, shake up the Megafauna and...Tch! Raraiya is on the ship... Mask, you klutz! The G-Self made it back! Until Raraiya is in our hands, we can't attack the Megafauna! Ugh! I can't let Miss Aida fight in a space battle! Go down! The beams are weak! Why won't you go down? I won't let you! - What? - You stopped moving! Either I'm a klutz, or the enemy is way too good! Barara, you can pull back! She was tricked by that flash of light! Mask! Lieutenant Kerbes! Cut the power to the parts that are shorting out! Is it true they demanded Raraiya? It's true. That's why the enemy isn't attacking the Megafauna. Raraiya, me. Still, there's no telling when we may get hit by a stray shot. Be careful. How exactly are we supposed to be careful? What do we do? What do we do? Your transformation... leaves you wide open! Barara! Captain Mask, were you facing the G-Self? It was nothing serious. But we failed to board the Megafauna. Give the mobile suits the signal to return. To head to the Capital Tower from here, we'd need to return to an elliptical orbit, so that's not possible. Thanks to the Megafauna's bizarre behavior... The Garanden's mobile suits corps had a skirmish with the Megafauna, but it seems they were unable to sink it. That's what it looked like. Why is that? This was the Capital Army's first engagement since ascending in their battleship. They'd be a bit disorganized, wouldn't they? Same with us. Right? Well, that makes sense! That was pitiful. You engaged the Megafauna and that was all you could do? It was my own failure. I'd forgotten the peculiarities of low orbital flight. If that's a message from Colonel Cumpa, deliver it to Mask. The Captain's Mack Knife is so badly damaged. The Mask Corps still lacks teamwork. Pushing two operations on him at once came back to curse you. Is cooperating with the force we sent that difficult? 1 gave the order for the Garanden 10 continue its ascent to Sanki Porto. In order to protect the pope from the threat in space, hmm? But of course. Aida was able to return to the Megafauna, right? We've taken no losses or damage. This fleet will continue ascending to Sankt Porto. - Understood? - Yes, Sir. The supply ships are scheduled to come up as well. We have five Crocodile-class ships, led by this Rattle-Python. They're faster than a Capital Tower Crown. The power of the Rose of Hermes Blueprints is a thing to be feared. Going up to Sankt Porto like this? What are you thinking? The Amerian fleet, the Capital Army's ship, and the Megafauna are going up. That's no reason. Non-believers going up will get them cursed. Then we have to go up so that we don't get cursed, no? So that you don't get cursed? You see how violent the Capital Army has become. Yes, but... Can't we suppress the curse if we can stop the insanity and recklessness? We must suppress the curse. You think we can do that with machines and the G-Self? It's home. Huh? She said home. Yeah. Translation and Subtitling: BTI Studios Limited o
