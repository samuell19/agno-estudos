Hey, Chief Why aren't you drinking? I never drink. Why ordered then? Having lemon tea every night is too obvious. It's more so if you ordered but don't drink. There's problem between Rachel and me. A fight? We never fight. Well, then that's a real problem. It has to do with me. Seeing another girl? Don't tell me you've turned gay. For you. Really? Oh, Chief. Thanks. It's been five years. I've come to realize I'm not for her. You know the origin of whiskey? Once upon a time, the alchemists thought whatever they put into the furnace could turn into something new. They started with metals, then almost anything else. One day they heated some barley and ended up with alcohol. Did they drink it? That's only ethanol. They used it for disinfection at first. But there wasn't that much to disinfect, so they kept the leftover in barrels. Years later, someone accidentally took a sip Yummy. Since then they started to brew whiskey. Why going off in tangent? Just to distract you. Take homicides for instance. There're so many possibilities. It takes time to nail the real murderer. If we can be patient in solving homicides, why can't we be the same with our women? Thanks... Chief. Why do people like drinking alcohol? Because it's hard to swallow. Merry Christmas. Yes. Got it. Sir, I'm scared. I can't stop talking when I'm scared. Normally, I'm not like that. Is your toilet... leaking? What? Is your toilet... leaking? Mr. Lai, I am Inspector Lau Ching Hei of Island Homicide. We have reasons to believe you're involved in 3 rape homicides. You are now under arrest. All you say will be submitted as evidence in court. It's just for fun, sir. Rachel died from severe blood loss. The coroner report said she had an abortion. She didn't tell Bong. Nor anyone else. Bong remained silent for days. When he spoke again, he said: "I never knew how horrible it was to realize your loved ones had vanished from this world suddenly, like Rachel and her baby." Later he handed in his resignation. When we met again, he's become a private eye and an alcoholic. This is my father. This is my husband. Call me Hei. Sit down. Beating crime used to be our mandate. Now all that matters is the crime rate. More time is spent on publicity than investigation. We're no different from office clerks. That's good. It's safer that way. I'm relieved to marry my daughter to you. Cheers. Cheers. It must be hard for Bong to see Rachel die. You better spend more time with him. We see each other every week. I even refer cases to him sometimes. You said it's hard to find, so I asked Bong to. He gave it to us for our wedding gift. No one is willing to sell. How did he manage to get it? We'll see him tonight. Ask him yourself when we see him. What're you two up to? Well... Thank you. It's weird that you and your dad didn't talk the whole night. What is it? Why keep it here? It's a trophy. Very precious. Not that money can buy. I don't like to have a gun in my house. You've been a wartime reporter at Iraq. How can you be scared of guns? But no war is raised at home. Says who? Terrorist attack. Two months ago, I located the people who owned such a camera. I went to see each of them, once every day. Finally, a man named Kwan agreed to sell me his camera. Why did he? He's over 90. Why not? Can I meet him? I wanna take his pictures to thank him. He died two weeks ago. We plan to take the team out for a banquet two weeks later. Good. Let's celebrate. Excuse me. Coming. How many bottles? Another round of whiskey, please. No whiskey. No? What do you mean by no? What kind of service is this? I am right here, see? A true buddy. You've asked for many rounds of whiskey. Don't you know what I'm selling? But I can't drink beer. If I drink beer, I would... After Bong resigned, he kept digging into Rachel's case. Months later, he finally found out on that Christmas eve Rachel had been in this bar for hours. No one knew whom she's waiting for. She took 4 glasses of whiskey and never spoke to anyone. Then she went home and killed herself. When things like this happen, most people would choose to escape. But I know Bong wouldn't. He has to know the reason. He won't quit until he finds out. It might seem meaningless. But to him, this is the only way out. Excuse me, Miss? Have you seen this woman here? Yes, two nights ago. What? Where? On your bed two nights ago. Susan. I get so sleepy these days. 'Cos you're happy. Are you up? Here's the rent for last night. But you've stayed for 3 nights. You're right... I'm sorry. Where you working tonight? Peace Avenue. Some hot spot. The more they drink, the less they cheat. I seldom go there. Take it easy. I'm not asking you to come. I'll call you. What for? Call me whenever you want. We are buddies after all. But... I wanna... raise the rent. OK. Buddies ought to be fair to each other. Yeah, buddy. Let's go, buddy. Bong, I'm taking statement. I'll call you back. Go on. Mr. Wong. Mr. Wong. Mr. Wong. Mr. Wong. Help. Help. You know what adultery is? You call these pics evidence? What kind of detective are you? Don't worry. It's 99% sure win at court. Ask your lawyer Lau if you don't trust me. I want 100% sure. I don't know how Lau could've hired you. You're fired. Forget about the final payment. And the pics of Lau and you making out, should I give them to you or him? I'll settle with you later, Lau. How much do you want? Just settle the final payment. I'll get you disqualified if you dare to fool me. What the hell, I'm not qualified anyway. Put the bottle down. Where's Chief? I wanna ask you a favor. Help me look into my dad's case. This one? It's closed already. I don't know either of them. Neither did my dad. I don't get it. Man would never open up to strangers. He'd consult my dad first. Perhaps Man knew these two guys. Or he opened the door by mistake? Even for my friends, Man would ask Dad first. We've fought over this many times. I think the real murderer knows my dad. Those two men were just fall guys. My mother died when I was four. I never really got to know my dad. I left home when I was 18. Perhaps I just wanna find out what kind of a person he was. You'll help me, won't you? I really want to. But we're talking about homicide here. And I'm no longer a cop. I thought you'd understand. Why else would you still hang out here? Should I call an ambulance? Drinking again? You wanna die or what? You've agreed to help Susan? What do you think? How about you? She raised a good point. Man would never open up to strangers. You think there was a third guy? Don't you find them a bit weird, being so cautious about strangers? What are you gonna do? Who's in charge of this case? Tsui the Bullshitter. Tsui the Bullshitter? Can't help it. I am a suspect myself. Susan's dad left a big fortune. So did you do it? Homicide is a serious crime, officer. First, you need to get me some intel. I need your help too. Susan's getting paranoid lately. She complains she's being stalked. Her doctor said she's just too nervous. But she refused to take medication. I have to drug her every night. Talk to her. OK, I'll do it over drinks. She can't mix drinks with her medication. Shit. We finished a bottle the other night. You're kidding? Sorry. What's wrong? Let's eat. I wanna move. I'll talk to the management office. You find me a real pain? You don't believe I'm being stalked. You see no suspicion in Dad's case. You don't trust me or you think I'm crazy? Of course, I trust you. You are my wife. I hope you trust me too. It's over if there is no trust between us. I never have a home. I don't wanna lose this one. You know what you've done. Here is the sitting room. Chow's body was discovered here. The butler Man was found in the study. CSI has probed the crime scene. There're stab wounds in Chow's left shoulder. Head concussions was the cause of death. The murder weapon is a brass Buddha statue. There're stab wounds in Man's left abdomen and face. The cause of death was also head concussions. Traces of his blood were found near the door. It's Man who opened the door. The killers attacked right after they got in. The crime should've happened this way. What's wrong, Man? A total of $3.87 million was taken. It has to be premeditated homicide robbery. The photos were all taken in Macau? Chow was from Macau, in transportation. He later moved to Hong Kong. It's Tsui's. Yeah, it's his file. How did you get it? I know about his mistress. Mistress? His wife Shirley is smart. How comes she didn't find out? Shirley is his mistress. His wife emigrated to Australia in 1997. Tsui, Bong is all yours. Inspector Bullshit. What's so funny? How's the weather in Australia? You find that funny? Listen up. I'm helping you only for old time's sake. You are past tense. OK. Stay away. The lock is connected to the security company. The alarm goes off if the code is not re-entered. It didn't go off that day. So? So someone came in and entered the code. So? So the two killers knew Chow or Man. Or they knew the code. Did you read my report? It's not in the report. How much does it cost to hire a butler? 10 to 20 grand a month. Not bad. Man has worked here for over 20 years. He took care of the mansion all by himself. Sometimes he acted as the chauffeur too. A cleaning maid came by occasionally. It's she who discovered their bodies. At first I thought Man had it up to here, so he killed Chow and himself. A woman was jogging nearby that morning. She sighted the two guys running there. Nobody knows what vehicle they were on. Wanna see their hideout? OK. The call was made from a convenience store in Lyndhurst Avenue. 9:30 p.m. last night, I was off duty already. Was it robbery? Just pickpocket. It happened a lot lately. Just checking out. No wonder. Wong and Keung were junkies. Both of them had priors. Just minor cases like thefts. Wong rented the house. He put poison in Keung's drink. Keung knew something's wrong after one sip. He pulled a knife and stabbed Wong. It's 7 inches long. Same weapon that killed Chow. In face of millions, who could control themselves? Did the cops bust the door open? No, it's pried open. It cannot be opened from outside. Cos it opens this way. The door was locked. You just broke it. They locked themselves in to kill each other. Got it, detective? Saw any strangers pass by that day? Yes. Back to the peak. It takes at least three connections and 11/2 hours by public transport. You mean a third guy picked them up, drove them back to the hideout and killed them. Perhaps they drove themselves. So there's no third guy? Keung stabbed Wong very precisely. He didn't seem to be poisoned. So there's a third guy then? It might be sheer luck. Or he was good at knife. You mean anything is possible? That's possible. Police said the door was locked from inside. How did the killer take off? The air-conditioner. Damn it. A bit far-fetched? Whiskey on rocks? Do you have beer? Thought you don't drink beer. I'm thirsty. Hong Kong is so hot lately. It's almost winter. Isn't it abnormal? Besides, it's very polluted. What's wrong? Chief said you shouldn't drink. Isn't it true every man describes his wife as a crazy bitch? What the hell. Cheers. Shirley? Haven't seen her for a while. Don't worry. I'll set her up with some nice guy. How's the kid? What's next? I'll start investigating the victims. That's your dad and Man. Bong. Go. Hei has kept something important here. Let me. Danger. Get out of here. The case has some complications. I crossed path with the suspect. But I let him slip away. You saw the suspect? Yes. Can you recognize him? Of course not. Sorry, I should have believed you. I'm glad you're OK. Bong, are you OK? I'm fine. You? Take Susan home. I'll see you in a couple of days. Let's go. Did you do it? Homicide is a serious crime, officer. Want a beer? Stay awhile. Sit down. No, I'll blow my cover. Shit. Think you're an undercover? Give him a draught. Come closer. Cheers. You can go now. Scram. What? Go. Take your beer with you. I'll call you. Your head... what's wrong? What do you mean by what's wrong? The customers got too high. Here to see me? No, just meeting some friend. When are you off? None of your business. Man called this number a week before he died. Does it ring a bell? No. That's all? How did you meet Chief? Didn't Hei tell you? One day, I left my camera in the mall. Hei found it for me. So I bought him dinner to thank him. I discovered we had a lot in common. Before we met, we've watched the same film in the same cinema, ordered the same dish at the same restaurant, even took the same flight to the same place. Is Hei involved in this case? No. Just wanna know how these things begin. Never tried it before? Can't remember. Last time I went to the US, he saw me off here. Then he showed up in LAX and proposed to me. I thought it was your idea. I just found him a faster flight. Let's eat. Oh, you're here. Just checking out. What is it? It's soup. Soup? You take this. I'll get another one. Oxtail soup, good for your kidney. She knows. About what? The drugs in the soup. She doesn't want you to worry. Really? I checked out Wong's family today. He only got an old mother with Alzheimer's. Didn't even know how to get on welfare. What about Keung? How about dropping him home? I checked Man's call record. A number called him twice before the murder. It's registered under Keung. Here's the address. What about this guy? Let him sleep. October 27, the day before the murder. I've checked the call record. The last number dialed was 23365195. That's Chow's home number. Keung was also from Macau. Maybe he knew Chow. Possibly. I think there's a third guy. Perhaps he's someone we both know? No idea. Bong. No. Police. Freeze. Let go of him. Bong, you all right? Police. Sorry. There's really a third guy. Why did he come back for us? What happened to your head? No big deal. Some guys got too high. You have a problem again? Should we help? No need. It's just work. What am I doing here? We came here for a nightcap. You collapsed after two rounds. And I passed out? What happened to your head? You hit me with the bottle. No kidding? I'm so sorry. It's OK. Check this license plate for me. Might be a lead. Thanks. Let me buy you a drink. Beer. Coming. The license plate has been tempered. The real number is GG8165. A phone was found. The last number dialed was 23589991. October 29 was not a special festival. But someone donated $10,000 to the temple. That's why I remembered. Did you meet this donor? No, he just left an envelope. Who is this man - Fu? A faithful departed. Wai Shu was on duty that day. She saw that man. Can you remember him? Yes, he is a man. Height? Size? Look? Wish I could see better. My eyes are failing. Everyone knows. I'm going blind, sir. Chow's time of death is 5:30 a.m. At 6:58 a.m. Keung called the temple. At 7:10 a.m. a snapshot of Keung's speeding car was taken on its way to the temple. Keung reached the temple at 7:20 a.m., stayed for 15 minutes and left. The coroner's report stated Keung and Wong's time of death was between 6 a.m. and 9 a.m. The shots from the Road Monitoring System show Keung crossing the road after he left the temple. There's a bus stop across the road with a bus to their hideout. It takes only an hour. That means their time of death should be around 8:30 a.m. I knew from the start it's not that simple. Keep digging. Get back to work. What's wrong with him? He lost his handcuffs. He can just buy another pair. Out of stock. Why did Keung drop Wong off and go to the temple, giving Wong a chance to poison him? They should have split the money first. Maybe there's something more important. I'll take a trip to Macau. Why are you here? Looking for you. What for? Let's go to Macau. I have to work. I'll pay you. Go to hell. I didn't mean that. What do you want? You want sex? You want sex? Come on. Is that what you want? OK, come on. Just do it right here. Come on. Come. I miss you. You miss me only when you're drunk? I've been sober for days. I still miss you. What about a few days later? Can we just chat? I like chatting with you. But I'm not sure if I can love you. Can we? Forget it. What's wrong with you? I didn't ask you what you wanted. You think too much. You don't know what you want. I know. I know. Don't pay me anymore. I'm not... I'm not a hooker. Jonesing for a drink? No. Red wine? You know why people like drinking alcohol? Why? Because it's hard to swallow. Which moron said that? I'm done with your father's case. Keung didn't kill your dad for money. He had other reasons. When your dad was young, he ran a transportation company in Macau. Got anything in Macau? That's not bad at all. I already told Susan. I learnt that 25 years ago in Macau, a man Fu and his entire family were murdered, including his wife, mother and daughter. Several men barged into Fu's house and killed without mercy. The entire family was dead. And the house was set on fire. Fu was an anti-narcotics cop. Some enemies of his wanted him offed. But they missed one person. Fu's son, Keung. A bunch of suspects were arrested. All of them had been investigated by Fu, including Man and Chow. Chow was in drug trafficking. Man was Fu's colleague. Chow bribed Man to pull strings for him. Fu refused his bribe and exposed him. Man quitted the force afterwards and started working for Chow. When Susan's mother died, Chow retired and moved to Hong Kong. The case turned cold. Keung survived the tragedy. It took him 25 years to get even. What would you have done in his position? If I had nothing to lose like him, I would have done the same. What you laughing at? Go. I like it... when you fight for me. Go. Cut it out... Bye. She's cute. Moving back to the mansion? Susan's taken over her dad's fortune. She said that's her home after all. Chief, remember we went to Keung's house? That night when Tsui hit you? I have been there by myself before we did. You thought I was a suspect? I'm sorry. It's all right. I would have done the same if I were you. According to Mr. Chow's will, all the properties, stocks, bonds and cash will be inherited solely by Ms. Chow. In principle, all of Mr. Chow's fortune is now Ms. Chow's. Hello? Speaking. Broadband installation tomorrow night? Please give me a call before you come. What're you doing? I'll tell you later. Why so mysterious? Don't look. Let me. I'll tell you later. Sure you're not coming? No. You go ahead. Get changed. After I'm changed, you take your medication. Susan is not coming? She is occupied. I don't know how to break the news to Susan. I got this from a fellow in Macau. Chow got married in 1978 but Susan was born in 1976. There's no father's name on her birth certificate. Chow is not Susan's real father. Lose. Lose. There was a gas explosion. A male body was found in the scene. His name is Lai. You busted him once. Looks like a case of vengeance. Your wife had serious concussion. She is in a coma. We've done everything we could. The rest is up to her. Mr. Lau, please wait outside. 2cc of 1:1000 adrenaline. Yes. CPR. The forecast says it'll be sunny the whole week. Good to get rid of the rain finally. It was depressing. But it will be warmer, about 22 degrees. You must have missed the sun. I'll take you for a walk when you wake up. Thanks for your help. No problem. Better than drinking all day long, right? Shut up. Hang in there, Chief. Susan will wake up. Ask her to buy you new underwear. I've torn some while washing, sorry. Go, wait downstairs. Leaving again? Go. Take the stairs. Bye. You've changed. For better or worse? Better. When I was a cop, I thought I could change the world. I tried so hard but failed. I didn't know what I was doing. Now I know, it's the world that's changing me. Chief, I've been trying to tell you this. Rachel's baby was not mine. I wanted to know whom she's waiting for that night. A month ago, Fung located that man for me. Rachel was going to meet him that night. Unfortunately, he had an accident. He went into a coma. I thought I would beat him up, or even kill him. But I didn't. I help him clean up once a week. I've become his amah. Don't worry, Chief. I'm fine. I still wanna have new underwear. What would the world be when you wake up? Pack some clothes. Take the clothes to the hospital, and wait for me at the Macau Ferry Terminal. Go. Tsui, this is Bong. Please check Chief's file for me. They used to stuff a quail in the goose to grill. It's very delicious. But it's hard to find now. You're so fat. I used to be slim in my school days. About 80 pounds only. Were you an athlete? 4 times ping pong champion. Never lost a match. How about the match in 1978? 1978... I did lose that one. I came in second. Remember who beat you? No, been such a long time. All right. Thank you. Thanks a lot. You're welcome. Thanks. Let's go. Captain Lau Ching Hei, line 3. Have you woken up? Did you marry me in order to kill Dad? Yes. So why are you still here? I don't want you to be hurt. I want to see you wake up. Have you ever loved me? I have. No, you haven't. I'm fine. I'm fine. Why got yourself so drunk? I'm fine. I just solved Susan's dad's case. I deserved a drink to celebrate. While I was boozing, I realized I didn't know how to explain to Susan. I started to muse and booze. The more I mused, the more I boozed. The more I boozed, the more I mused. I went to Macau a few days ago. You know where I went? The primary school Keung attended. In 1978, he won the inter-school table tennis tournament. Carrying the new paddle, he ran home to show his father, only to witness his family brutally murdered by Man and Chow. Terrified, he fled the scene. He witnessed the whole tragedy. He ran to his father's office. But there he found the perps with his father's colleagues. He dared not go to the police. He understood the murderers would take him out. After hiding in the convent for a week, Sister Mace found him and accepted him into the orphanage. When Sister Mace asked him his name, he said without a thought. My name is Lau Ching Hei. The name kept him alive. When he heard Chow moved to Hong Kong, he followed him to Hong Kong. After college, he became a cop. Then he married Susan. In the end, he killed Chow. A bit far-fetched. Isn't it, Keung? You'll never understand. Have you ever lost everything? I have. I lost everything in one day. My home, my family, even my own identity. I want Chow to experience that. I didn't dwell on revenge as there's no chance. 4 years ago, I accidentally came across Keung's file in the police record. He's also from Macau, with no ties. The same ordinary name. It's a golden chance from heaven. What about Wong? He said he could kill for 50 grand. Such a bastard deserved to die. And Susan? She was part of my plan. To get to Chow, I had to spy on her. I followed her to movies, restaurants, even to trips overseas. After we married, we came back to Hong Kong. I went to see Chow and told him I was Fu's son. Susan is innocent. And my family wasn't? I always thought this was a perfect plan. Nary a wrong move. Then I saw Susan in the hospital. I realized it's no matter if she's Chow's daughter or not. She's my wife. My family. Same as Dad, Mum, Sis and Granny. She's my family. Thank you. Cheers. Cheers. I told you I liked you. That's true. I know. You've asked me not to give you money. You better not back out. Of course. But... But what? But... Listen. But... How about family expenses? How much? The more you give, the better the service. Boss.
