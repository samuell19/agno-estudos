Let us get as far as we can while we have light. After all, we are still in the Mongol Tribe's territory here. Chiled, here they come again! Those men are after me. Do not fear! I will protect you! No! You must live! Live and... come take me back! Hoelun! I will take you back, without fail! Wait for me! I am the chief of the Borjigins, a clan of the Mongol Tribe. Yesukhei Baghutur. I am taking you to my ayil. [camp] Do not cry. Why... steal me away when I am but newlywed? My husband will come to take me back, without fail. You will be at war with the Merkits. Nothing would please me more. Come when they may, I will send those Merkits running! Tell me. Your name... What is your name? Wife of Yege Chiled of the Merkits, Hoelun. Hoelun, is it? Starting today, you will be my wife. I will treat you well. "Someday, I will have my revenge for this." In my heart, I swore fervently that I would. Approximately ten lunar months passed since I was abducted by Yesukhei. The baby is coming. Please stop. It will be all right. It will not be long now. There you go. There you go! Gather the women here. Hurry it up! Here in the land of the Mongols, tribes clashed time and again. The men defeated in battle were killed and the women became spoils of war. Keep moving! Chief! This is their leader! He killed many of our men. Though you are my foe, you did admirably. What is your name? It's Temüjin! Temüjin Uge! Temüjin, is it? I will not forget that name! Chief! The child is born! It is a boy! I see! A boy! Temüjin? You are naming him Temüjin? Yes. A good name, is it not? It is the name of a brave enemy general, whom I cut down. I see! That Tatar? Yes, that one. Temüjin... Yes. Temüjin, son of Yesukhei Baghatur. Named after an enemy general, killed by his own father's hands, Temüjin was born to a bloody destiny of carnage. Rest well. This child is... When Temüjin turned fourteen, he left on a journey with his father, Yesukhei, in search of a wife. In those ten-odd years, I bore four more children after Temüjin. And I was also raising two other children born of a different mother. My first Merkit husband, who had promised to come take me back, never did come for me, and before I knew it, months and years had passed. Father. Look at how far Burhan Haldun is. By tomorrow, it will be out of sight. Though Burhan Haldun may no longer be visible, that mountain's spirit always watches over those of us of the Mongol Tribe. Temüjin, upon that mountain is our forefather, born with a destiny of Tengri. The Blue Wolf. The Blue Wolf? Yes. The Blue Wolf crossed the lake, met the White Doe, and took her as his wife. Born of that union was Battsagaan. And generation after generation, we of the Mongol Tribe are direct descendents who inherited his blood. Temüjin. You have as well. The Blue Wolf's blood flows in my veins, too? This is from beyond the Uyghur lands. An alcoholic drink called "wine." How do you like it? In this land with your flourishing trade, you always have such novel things. Yesukhei, where do you plan to go from here? In truth, we are searching for a wife for my son, Temüjin, and we are about to seek out the Olkhunuts, his mother's kin. This is my daughter, Börte. I had a dream last night, you see. Oh? A dream? A white falcon caught the sun and the moon and flew over to perch upon my arm. I was just telling my daughter that the white falcon was certain to bring good fortune to our family. Is that not right, Börte? Father, you have already told the story of your dream three times since this morning! The mystery of this dream is now unraveled. The white falcon was telling me that you would be bringing your son. It is so quiet. Here, it is as if war does not exist. You have been to war, Temüjin? Not yet. But I wish to go soon and fight. I want to avenge my tribe. Börte! Hello, Börte. Who is he? My betrothed. Your betrothed? I am Jamuqa of the Jadirat Clan. I have known Börte since we were little. I am Temüjin of the Mongol Tribe. I will be here a while. I bid you greetings. How about it? Care to test your archery skills against mine? Archery, is it? Your skill is impressive. Even among us, there is no one capable of what you have done. Like you, my ancestors come from the Mongol Tribe. Temüjin, let us swear the oath of anda. [blood brothers] The oath of anda, is it? Very well. As of this day, we shall be friends, closer than brothers by birth. We shall never betray one another. We shall value our friendship for the rest of our lives. I swear that as long as we live, we are anda! I swear it, Temüjin! Someday, I wish to unite the Mongols as one nation. "Nation"? What is a "nation"? The tribes united as one large body. Can such a thing be done? Look. Take the Jin. One king rules over this vast territory all alone. Alone? But the Jin are our enemy. Temüjin, think carefully. For a long time now, we nomadic people have warred with one another over and over. If we continue in that way, the Mongols are certain to face ruin. Someone must unite us and make us a prosperous nation that is free of war. I see. I had no idea you had such thoughts, Jamuqa. Temüjin! Munrik! I thought you had returned with my father. What is wrong? Temüjin... I am sorry. The Chief... has been poisoned by the Tatars. Poison? And my father?! He is dead! My father was... murdered?! It was five days after the funeral that Temüjin returned. With Yesukhei gone, Talgutei of the Tayichi'uts named himself the successor and left this land, leading away the tribe. There is nothing left that keeps us here! Follow the Onon River to new pastures! Do not stop your horses! Keep moving without rest! What is going on?! Why?! Why do this?! Why are you leaving this place?! Tell me, where are you going? What happened?! Why are you going?! Tell me! What is wrong?! We must not leave this place! Hurry! Do not be taken in by this traitor! Please go back! Temüjin! Stay out of this! Talgutei, this is an act of betrayal against my father, Yesukhei! You are not yet a man, do not speak as if you are! You are no Mongol! You are a Merkit with their filthy blood! What nonsense is this? I am the son of Yesukhei Baghutur! No one accepts you as his heir. Your mother has lain with a Merkit. Who would follow you as their chief, when you were born of a woman like that?! Temüjin! Stop this, Temüjin! Talgutei! We of Yesukhei's family will never forget your betrayal! Do not forget the Merkit blood, either. Forsaken by our tribe, we had to forage for our own food to survive. You two! What are you doing?! It is our rule that we take back all game and share it with the rest of the family! I do not take orders from the get of a Merkit! What did you say? Temüjin, when your mother was abducted, a Merkit seed had already taken root in her womb and you were born! Belgutei, you draw, too! Draw, Temüjin. Draw your sword and come at me! What is it? Are you afraid? You really are Merkit scum! Bekhter. No, Temüjin. Please, no. Bekhter, as long as you are with us, we cannot stand united. If things remain as they are, the family will be broken apart and we will not be able to survive. So... I will kill you! Bekhter! Belgutei, run! They will kill you! I will not kill Belgutei. Only you. You boys... What have you done? Temüjin! Qasar! You two... He was a brother, who shared your blood... One of your few allies... And you have killed him. Though he may have been disrupting the unity of this family, you went too far! He did not just disrupt our unity. He... insulted you, Mother. Insulted... me? That is why I killed him. He showed absolutely no mercy to those who disobeyed orders. To those who betrayed. Such was Temüjin's stern nature. And that was not to change for the rest of his life. We can build all the fencing we want. If the Tayichi'uts attack, it will only hinder them for a short while. I know. It is to buy time, so the women and children can escape into the woods. Everyone of the Borjigin is against the way Talgutei is running things. If it comes down to it, they will be coming back, just as I did. Munrik, I am grateful that you brought your people to me. They got us! Some horse thieves got us! Horse thieves? How many?! How many horses did they take?! Eight went missing while I looked away briefly. They should not have gotten too far yet. There is surely more than one thief. I will go. Not you, Brother. I will go instead. We cannot fight with eight horses missing! I will go and get them back in short order! No! Make sure you mix it properly! How dare you steal my horses! You damned horse thief! Hold on! No, you have it all wrong! What do I have wrong?! Some horse thieves passed through here this morning! They'd stolen from me before, too, so I thought, "The damned bastards must've struck again!" And when I threatened them, they left the horses and ran away. So these are your horses? Yes, they are. I am taking them back. You can have them! You can have them, so lower your bow, please. Are you Temüjin of the Borjigin? How do you know me? News travels fast on the plains. I hear you've suffered hardships since the Tayichi'uts betrayed you. And that you only have a handful of warriors. Our numbers may be few, but we have not lost heart. That's the spirit. There are ways to fight, even with fewer men. Come, I'll return your horses. I will repay you. But you will need to wait a while. Even one less horse will hurt us greatly. I'll wait for my reward, Temüjin. There are many ways to show thanks. I'll look forward to it. I am Bo'orchu. Don't forget it. Bo'orchu, is it? I will not forget you. The following year, Temüjin went to collect his bride and for the first time in seven years, he went to visit Dei Seichun of the Onggirats. Temüjin. So you are alive! Sir? There were rumors that you had been attacked by the Tayichi'uts and died. Seven years since then, we have had no word of you. And Börte was only growing older, past her first bloom of youth. I made arrangements for her to marry another. I must apologize for that. After my father died, my tribe was broken apart and while I worried about my betrothal... After you have come all this way for her... So... Who is Börte to marry? Jamuqa. Because he begged for her hand. Jamuqa did? I see. Jamuqa did... Temüjin! I came quickly when I heard of your arrival. Jamuqa! It has been so long! Jamuqa, congratulations. Did you see Börte? No, I will be leaving now. Make Börte happy. Temüjin, I do not want to ruin our friendship over something like this. Who would she choose between you and me? Let us have Börte decide. Börte, who will you choose, Temüjin or me? I will leave the decision to you. Tell us. Börte, what is the matter? Will it be Temüjin? Or me? Börte, you are certain of this? Are you truly certain that you want me? I am so grateful that you chose me! You have grown beautiful. Temüjin, I was unfaithful. Unfaithful? While it was upon my father's advice, I still exchanged vows with Jamuqa and decided to be his wife. You had promised to come for me, without fail, and I betrayed you. Börte, I am the one at fault. Since I lost my father and was betrayed by the Tayichi'uts, it was all I could do to ensure the day-to-day survival of my family and tribe. And for seven long years, I neglected you without ever sending you word! For a young maiden to cease waiting for a man, who might not even be alive... Who could condemn you for that? Börte... Please forgive me. I am the one who must ask forgiveness. For I was unfaithful when I should not have been. But Temüjin... You also... betrayed me. I? Yes. Why did you try to leave without seeing me? That was because... I heard you were to be the wife of my anda, Jamuqa. Because I thought you would find happiness. Why did you not say, "That must not be! Börte is my wife!" and raise your voice and cry out for me? That was the same as my unfaithfulness. The same as betrayal. It pained me. Börte. I will atone for this. I will spend the rest of my life... atoning for my unfaithfulness! I will never let you suffer again. I swear it! The Chief has returned! Mother. This is Börte. I am pleased to meet you, Mother. It is good of you to come all this way. These are my younger brothers. And my younger sister, Temulen. Greetings to you, Temulen. Now, come this way. All of you, help carry her things in. Temüjin! Ah, Bo'orchu! You came back with a fine bride! So, you came! I arrived while you were gone. I came for the reward you had promised me. Yes. What do you want? Let me join your people. I don't want to end my days as the head of a tiny nomadic tribe. So that is the reward you want? I will give it to you gladly. I have been looking for someone who can see things differently than me. I cannot go wrong with you! Starting today, this is where you will live. I prepared all the usual necessities, so you will have to make do with this. I will be fine, Mother. Börte. You have gone through life without wanting for anything. Will you be able to bear our life of poverty? Poverty is not all. With the need to guard against attacks, I was told there is never any time to be at ease. But... Compared to the pain of being apart for seven years, that is nothing. Thank you, Börte. Compared to before, there are more people willing to join us and we are growing somewhat stronger, but if the Tayichi'uts or the Tatars, or even the Merkits were to launch a serious attack, we have no chance of standing against them. He will surely protect us. He said he would never let me suffer again. He swore to me. It relieves me to hear that, Börte. In June, two years after their marriage, to strengthen the alliance with Toghrul, the Khan of Kerait, Temüjin went to see him with tribute. So you are Temüjin? I have heard of you. I am honored to meet you. So? What brings you here today? When my father, Yesukhei, passed away, with his final words, he bade me to look to you, Toghrul Khan. I have not forgotten about my anda, Yesukhei Baghatur. Today, as the first token of our alliance since my father's passing, I bring a treasure of my house, a robe made of black sable. You, Toghrul Khan, are practically a second father to me, and I respectfully present it to you. A robe... made of black sable... Ah, this is a fine gift indeed. I am amazed that such a thing was in your possession. My wife... brought it with her. I see. Temüjin. Sire! Support me and serve me loyally from now on. Do so... and you will have all but secured safety for yourself. It was the autumn of that year... Please... grant us... the bounty of nature. What is that sound? Temüjin, please wake up! Everyone, wake up! I hear the pounding of hooves in the distance! Listen to me. Go with my mother and flee into the woods. Dear Husband... Stay calm. You just have to do exactly as we planned. We're under attack! The enemy is attacking! It's the Tayichi'uts! The enemy is the Tayichi'uts! Don't panic! The enemy is still one hill away! Stay calm and prepare to flee! Tolui! What are their numbers?! Five or six hundred! Chief! The enemy is the Tayichi'uts! Brother! The enemy soldiers number five or six hundred! Understood? We proceed as planned. Yes, Sir! We only have fifty men on horseback. We must not confront the enemy directly. First, take a small band and halt the enemy's advance. Yes, Sir! Munrik. Sir! Put the women on horses and have them flee into the hills. Put those who cannot ride onto carts. Do not let them take anything with them. Hurry. Yes, Sir! The enemy is coming! The enemy is coming! Move! Hurry! What about Börte? Where is Börte? I will go get her. Lady Hoelun! Please go on ahead! If you stay here, it will delay the others. Börte is not here yet. We will put Lady Börte on a later cart. Go on, leave! Yes, Sir. Chief! These guys aren't Tayichi'uts! They're Merkits! Retreat! Retreat! Burn everything! Bring it all down! Mother! Mother, the attackers were Merkits. Merkits? We were thinking the direction was wrong for the Tayichi'uts. The shape of their bows was also different. Then... The Merkits... Mother! Mother! Temüjin! You are safe! Thank goodness. Is everyone here?! Is everyone unharmed?! We have not lost a single man! After facing an attack by an enemy ten times our number, that is like a miracle! Let us first rejoice in that! Temüjin! Is Börte not with you? What of Börte? She is not here?! Meaning, she was already gone by the time Coaquchin went for her? So Börte is not here... I see. So that was what the Merkits were after. I am going back to look for her! No! Stop this! Silence! Go back now and you'll be killed! Chief! Move aside! Brother! If we lose you, it will spell ruin for us as well! Move aside! Chief! Brother! Chief! Please stop! Temüjin! Temüjin! The story that Father... abducted you... away from the Merkits... It is true, isn't it? It has been over twenty years! And yet, they stole away Börte as revenge for that? Ever since I was little, I have been called the seed of a Merkit! But I never believed it! Mother... I want you to tell me. Am I of Merkit blood? Or... Stop this! You insult our mother! Please answer me. Am I not Father's child? Please stop this! What are you saying after all this time? You may be my elder brother, but I will never... allow you to say such things again! Temüjin. The one to prove that you are Yesukhei Baghatur's child... is not I. It is you. Your father, Yesukhei Baghatur, never once questioned me, doubting that you were not his child. It was because he believed that you would prove yourself that you have the blood of the Blue Wolf in your veins. Mother. Qasar. We must not allow the same tragedy to be repeated. Work with Temüjin, and bring back Börte as soon as you can. Father... Please tell me. What am I? Does your blood not flow in me? With no means to strike back, six months went by. Börte is my wife. I will take her back by my own hands. I understand how you feel, but Chief, we barely number three hundred. The enemy has three thousand. Even the best sneak attack does not afford us a hope of victory. Now is the time to ask for reinforcements from Toghrul. Brother, send a messenger to your anda, Jamuqa, and ask his aid as well. Chief, you must not leave a woman in an enemy camp for long. If a year or two passes and she comes to raise Merkit children, she will no longer be able to return. We must come to a decision. Chief, let us ask for help from Toghrul and Jamuqa. Thank you. I am gratified. I will be in command. Agreed? I leave it to you. Let us wait for the dark of night and launch a sneak attack. Toghrul Khan, you will take the right flank. Are we agreed? I do not need you to tell me this. My forces will strike the Merkits from behind, through the hills. Temüjin, you will take the main gate from the front. Toghrul Khan, please lend me five hundred of your men. Three hundred soldiers is not enough for a frontal assault. Very well. I will lend you my very best contingent. In exchange, my share of the spoils will be seven parts. Two will go to Jamuqa and you will have one. Agreed? Two parts to me?! Then I am withdrawing! Now wait! I do not need my share! It is only with both your help that I can strike at the Merkits. I will be most honored to share the battlefield with you. Attack! Where is Börte?! Börte! Forward! Börte! Temüjin, we know where Börte went! Börte! It is Temüjin! Their numbers?! About ten on horseback! All right, we leave her! Retreat! Yes, Sir! Börte! After them! Go after them! Is that you, Börte? It is you, is it not, Börte? What is wrong, Börte? Have you forgotten me? I am your husband. Dear Husband... I missed you. Dear Husband... Take Börte back home. Take her back, cart and all! Yes, Sir! Temüjin. This is the fate of women living in Mongol. Do not let it weigh upon you. We got him! Come on, get up! This is Chiled! He took Lady Börte! Yesukhei Baghutur stole Hoelun from me! And this was my revenge! So this is the man... You bastard! He is dead. He is already dead! The celebrations continued for three days and three nights. I see you are all having a good time! You are all here, still alive! Chief, please settle down and have a drink! Yes, I will have a drink! Bo'orchu! For your courage and quick wits in battle. Blessings on you! Belgutei, for your brilliant swordsmanship. Qasar, no other is as masterful with a bow as you. May Tengri bless you! Munrik! My family's captain of the guard. For your generosity and experience, blessings on you. Jelme. Countless enemies fall to your arrowheads and spears. For that I thank Tengri. Blessings on you! The child is born! It is a boy! He is certain to kill this child. I will not allow it. I am coming in. Börte, give me that child. What will you do? Will you embrace this child? Do not be absurd! I cannot allow a Merkit child to live. I will kill him. Why have you determined that this is a Merkit child? Not only that, this child is a girl. Even if it is a girl, will you kill her? A girl? I heard it was a boy. A girl, is it? Truly? Then I shall spare her life. In exchange, do not ever let my eyes fall on her again. What if... What if this child is a boy? If it is a boy? So it is a boy. Then I will kill him. Börte, give me that child. A child is a gift from Tengri. You must not kill him. I am not killing a child. I am killing a Merkit. Temüjin, a newborn child has done no wrong. Why can you not find it in your heart to raise him as your own? Your father was not this way. If Yesukhei Baghatur, who is no longer with us, had suspected you were a Merkit child and had killed you, you would not be here today. Those who suffer the most from this cycle of abduction and revenge... are the women. And now, you would even take away her child? Temüjin. I do not mean to blame Börte. It is my fault for allowing her to be taken. As long as I... am the leader of this tribe, I will never again... allow a woman to be taken by the enemy as spoils of war! Then... accept this child! Give him a name! Dear Husband, I beg of you. Give this child a name. Jochi. Yes. His name... is Jochi. Jochi? "Jochi" means "outsider." Born an outsider... The poor child. I do not care what he is called. For he has escaped being killed and is now allowed to live. Is that not so, Jochi? War leaves a great scar upon the defeated. And the tribes that secured victory quickly grow in strength. Word of mighty Temüjin spread across all of Mongol and with each passing year, more and more tribes flocked to him. Toghrul Khan, I am honored that you have come all this way. You have a fine ayil! Temüjin, you have come far. The truth is, an emissary came to me from the Jin emperor. They are having trouble gaining control over the Tatars, and they have come to me for reinforcements. Temüjin, will you not strike down the Tatars with me? Just the mention of the name "Jin" makes me tremble with hatred. But consider, Temüjin, the Tatars are also your enemy, who poisoned and killed your father. Overlook the matter of the Jin for now and take up arms with me against the Tatars! Above all else, if we strike down the Tatars, the spoils of war that will be ours will be vast! Toghrul Khan, why have you called upon my army instead of Jamuqa's? Your... vigor! Temüjin, I have great faith in your abilities! At long last, it is time for us to strike at our sworn mortal enemy, the Tatars! The Tatars betrayed our second khan, Ambaghai, to the Jin, killed our third khan, Qutula, and poisoned the fourth, my father, Yesukhei! As long as the Tatars live, the spirits of our ancestors cannot rest in peace! Do you hear me?! Now is the time to marshal all our strength, wipe out the Tatars, and put our ancestors' spirits to rest! In this battle against the Tatars, it is said that in their strategy, the Jin's army attacked from the front, while the combined forces of Temüjin and Toghrul Khan attacked from behind. After a fierce battle lasting approximately ten days, the greater part of the Tatar's forces was destroyed. Chief, he has returned. Whoa! Ah, Temüjin! A falcon hunt to celebrate our victory. A fine way to celebrate. Toghrul Khan, my army will now strike camp and return home, dealing with Tatar stragglers along the way. I see. So you are going home. Well, come in. Yes, Sire. Temüjin. Sire. In this war, I saw clearly how capable you are. Right now, you could fight Jamuqa and win without trouble. Fight Jamuqa? Temüjin, crush Jamuqa while you can. Otherwise, he will eventually come for you. Surely not. Jamuqa and I swore the oath of anda. An anda? So what? Unite the Mongols into one nation. That is the what Jamuqa and I dream of. Jamuqa dreams of no such thing. King of the hill. All he has is a petty ambition to become number one. In any event, you and Jamuqa cannot go forward, shoulder to shoulder. I am also indebted to Jamuqa for my wife, Börte. Stirring up trouble with my anda is not something I can do. Pardon me. Brother! Teichal, what are you here for? I am about to begin combat exercises. I would like a word with you first. What is it? Brother, how can you be so unconcerned? Unconcerned? What are you talking about? Temüjin has joined forces with Toghrul, leaving you out. They can strike down the Tatars or the Tayichi'uts. I do not care. The Mongols do not need two khans. That is just it. Temüjin is trying to shoulder you aside and become that lone khan. He could never do it. Temüjin lost his mind over one woman and went to war with the Merkits. It will be impossible for him. Women are for pleasure or a means of bearing children. They can be replaced easily. One must be utterly cold and implacable to be khan. And yet, Temüjin allowed his love for Börte to consume him. So you say, but you allow your oath of anda with Temüjin to get the better of you. Being an anda is not a sign of trust. It is a manifestation of the fear of betrayal. It is a child's game. Chief! There is a party up ahead that we had not seen before! Tatar stragglers? I believe they are Merkit stragglers. Whether they be Tatars or Merkits, we will crush them! Yes, Sir! Wait! A woman? What is your name?! State your name! Kill me. I do not kill women. I have lost. Kill me. I am a soldier. Enough! Take off your armor and be at ease. Do not touch me! I will not be your woman. All men are the same. They rape women and make them bear children. My father and brothers have all died in battle. I am now head of the family. I will suffer the hardships of a Mongol woman no more! I see. Then, what can you do? Go to war and fight. I will not become the spoils of war, just because I am a woman. I never take women as spoils of war. I will not bring any more grief to Mongol women! You are a fine and respectable soldier. Come with us. I will make you a Mongol soldier! Do you speak truly? I do not lie. Your name? Kulan. Very well. Kulan, starting today, you are one of my soldiers. Come. Temüjin. Welcome home. So you have struck down the Tatars... I have finally... avenged our tribe. The children were delighted by the gifts. Jochi, what did you take for yourself? I have no particular desires. Jochi. What is the matter? Just take what you want. Then... I will take this. Oh? What is that? This is used when you shoot arrows. There are far better gifts. What an odd one you are. Dear Husband, Jochi is seventeen already. He is ready to go to war at any time. If you find an opportunity, please allow him to join you. Yes... I had just been thinking of a mission for Jochi. The people to the north have been sheltering Merkit stragglers and their numbers have grown to be considerable. Left alone, the remnants of the Tatars will join them as well and as a larger force, they will once again pose a threat to us. Strike them down before they do. I trust you can do this? Yes! I will not disappoint you, my chief! Temüjin, Jochi is an inexperienced warrior! If he is sent to fight in such a hostile land, who knows if he will even come back alive? It is fine, Mother. I have faith the child will carry out his mission. Jochi. Strike down the Merkits and prove that the blood of the Blue Wolf runs in your veins. Father... no, Chief, I will strike them down, without fail! I am coming in. Brother, please step outside for a moment. Excuse me. Uncle. The Chief has ordered me to hunt the remnants of the Merkits in the north. In the north? Jochi, that is a serious mission. Be careful. I will. Kulan. You wished to see me? What is the matter, Kulan? Why... do you not bed me? Why? You are a soldier. Did you not forsake being a woman? In war, I am a soldier. Right now, I am a woman. I see. And what do you expect me to do with this woman? I give her to you. To the chief, who treats women as people and not as a diversion, I give you the woman in me. There was a time... when I did not treat women so. But when I met you, I learned for the first time that women also have pride. A human pride, no less than that of a man. Kulan. I will have the woman in you, your pride! Chief! More people from Jamuqa's camp! This time, ten whole families at once. What is going on? So many warriors... Why?! Why do they all go to Temüjin?! In both courage and cunning, I am the equal of Temüjin. No... I am better than him! What is it about Temüjin that draws so many people to him? Hardship! Hardship shaped Temüjin's character. But at this rate, you will be at a disadvantage to Temüjin. Brother, he will steal the khanship from you! Teichal, you strike camp and go to Temüjin as well. What did you say? Do you not see?! You will go join Temüjin. My elder brother is utterly without support within the tribe. He cannot even lead his men well in battle. The spoils are distributed by seniority and it all goes to the older men! In addition, he is extremely coldhearted! Teichal, you should not speak so ill of him. He is not worthy of being a clan chief! Temüjin, please allow me to join you as well. I beg of you! Stop this. It seems I must find a chance to speak plainly with Jamuqa. What is the meaning of this? He tried to kill you. Tried to kill me? This cannot be... This is a battle that divides all of Mongol in two. This battle will be greater and harder than any we have fought! If by some chance, we are defeated, our tribe is certain to disappear from this land. Our rise or fall hinges solely upon this battle! I have long dreamed of uniting the Mongols. I now ask for your help to achieve it! I am... the one and only khan! Attack! Fire! After them! After them! Go! Go! Charge! Attack! The two armies fought back and forth over many days with fierce desperation, but while Temüjin remained calm and collected, Jamuqa's command was undermined by his eagerness to win and the tide gradually turned against him. Retreat! Let us pass. Who are you? I am Jamuqa of the Jadirat Clan. I have come to see Toghrul Khan. Sire, in this battle, I have suffered a crushing defeat, but I still have my dream of uniting the Mongols... No... If I cannot realize this dream myself, then by all means, I would see you realize it. You are telling me to strike down Temüjin and take the Mongols? Just so. As things stand, it is inevitable that Temüjin will turn his appetite for conquest on you and the Keraits. Sire, if you are to kill Temüjin, now is your chance, when he is exhausted from the recent battle. Please ready your soldiers. Speaking of which, how many soldiers are left on your lands? My land is certain to have been burned and my soldiers slaughtered down to the last man. As it happens, while Temüjin won the battle, it seems that not only has he not invaded your lands, but he has also not laid a hand on your treasure or your men. Is this true? So it seems. Perhaps... he is especially indulgent towards you because of your oath of anda. I... have been moving from place to place since my defeat, so I had not heard of this. So Temüjin has not... I do not understand. Jamuqa and Toghrul Khan... Of all things, those two... Chief, I would like time to rebuild our strength. Please send messengers and delay the start of battle. Good idea. What do you all think? I agree. Yes. I agree. Ready our forces immediately. Chief... In doing this, I intend to win. We will win, without fail. Uncle, this time, I will join the main frontline against the Keraits. Yes... Jochi, they are a worthy foe. Test your young strength to the utmost. I will! To the north? You are sending me north again? It is a vital mission. Bring the northern tribes under our control and secure all the woodland resources there. With all due respect, Chief, I would like to fight upon the main battlefield against the Kerait army. Jochi, heed me well. We will win against the Keraits, without fail. In time, the Mongols will be united as one nation. When that happens, we will need resources. We must take measures now in order to sustain the people with all that they will need. With all due respect, I do not ever wish to go north again! Jochi. You would disobey me? Brother! I will go north! In exchange, allow Jochi to fight against the Keraits... Qasar! Jochi is my son! You will stay out of this. Go! Depart immediately! Why does Father exclude me from this crucial battle?! Mother, when I was born, is it true that my father tried to kill me? Who told you that? That I could not be allowed to live because I was of Merkit blood. Mother, is it true?! Jochi! You must not say such things! Father is hoping... that I will die in the north! What father would wish for his own child's death?! Leave at once! You will do your father's bidding! Temüjin should be the one who best understands how Jochi feels. And yet... Why must there be such discord? Halt! Forward! In this battle, Temüjin was forced into a desperate fight from the start. Not only were they not recovered from their great battle, but both their numbers and weapons were also inferior. It became clearer by the day that they were losing. Chief! We are under attack! We are under attack! After him! After him! Chief! Chief! Chief! Chief! Chief! Poison! Chief! Please stay with us! Chief! Chief! Chief! Chief... Do not retreat. Chief! It's Bo'orchu! Chief! Chief, have some water! Bo'orchu, you are alive. No, you would never die. And you, Chief! You are immortal! Kulan, do not cry. You are a soldier. Back to camp! We'll go back to camp, eat and drink our fill, regain our strength, and make haste back to the battlefield! Toghrul Khan, do you not think it imprudent to withdraw all your forces? The war is over. Temüjin is rotting upon the plains, felled by a poisoned arrow. You have won. Luck has always taken Temüjin's side. You must not give way to unreserved optimism. We are under attack! Temüjin! It's Temüjin's army! So, as I expected, he is alive. We are under attack! Jamuqa, what do we do? This is your camp! Toghrul Khan, we will stand our ground and fight! Give the order to the soldiers! All of you, stand your ground! Fight! Do not retreat! Fight! What are you doing?! Do not retreat! Jamuqa, I am retreating! Hold it! Is the khan of the Keraits not ashamed to turn his back on the enemy?! Who do you think I am?! You old fool! Jamuqa, please come with us. Untie him. Did you still believe? You did not steal the sheep from my land, you did not kill my soldiers, nor did you burn my gers. [tents] Was it because you believed in our oath of anda? It has been thirty years since then, when we looked up at the stars and spoke of the future together. I have forgotten the past. The lone khan of all the Mongols was not to be me, but you. Jamuqa. Will you not be my right arm? I need your bravery and wisdom. You, who know war so well. Let us strike down the Jin together. I refuse. Why? My pride as a man will not allow it. Temüjin, kill me without delay. With my death, this strife will surely vanish. But grant me one last wish. Kill me without tainting this land, without spilling a drop of blood. Very well. I will pay the highest honor to the noble Mongol warrior. Qasar, prepare a jute sack. No. Temüjin, with your own hands... I want you to strangle me. With my own hands? Temüjin... With your own hands, without spilling a drop of blood. Come, quickly. Kill me. Please. Kill me. "April 16, 1206" Here, by the will of Tengri, God of Eternal Blue Heaven, to be invested with a divine mandate, to be declared Khan, and to unite all the Mongol tribes, Genghis was sent to this land! Here and now, granted Tengri's divine mandate, I become Khan of Great Mongol! As a descendant of the Blue Wolf, sent to earth by Tengri, the nation of the Blue Wolf has been established with this land as its center! The Blue Wolf's pack united here must go to the ends of the world, as far as this land extends! Look into the distance! Send your spirits soaring to the ends of the earth! To make this land, where our ancestors sleep, the most prosperous nation of brothers upon this earth, unite your will with mine! To all the Blue Wolves gathered here today, may you be blessed with Tengri's bounty and divine protection! O Tengri! I call upon you to witness... the journey of the Blue Wolves as they go forth from the dawn of Mongol! Hurrah! Hurrah! Genghis Khan! Genghis Khan! Genghis Khan! Hurrah! Hurrah! Genghis Khan! Genghis Khan! Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! Genghis Khan! Genghis Khan! Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! Genghis Khan! Genghis Khan! Genghis Khan! Hurrah! Hurrah! Genghis Khan! Genghis Khan! Genghis Khan! Hurrah! Hurrah! Sire? Qasar, did you hear this voice of the people? I have come to a decision just now. I will strike down the Jin! Sire. I will strike them down with Jochi. Bring him back. Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! Genghis Khan! Genghis Khan! Genghis Khan! Hurrah! Hurrah! Genghis Khan! Genghis Khan! Hurrah! Hurrah! Genghis Khan! Genghis Khan! Genghis Khan! When we take all that into consideration, even if all goes well, assaulting the Jin's Great Wall will take ten days. Then we will have to make the desert crossing faster. You say faster, but we are moving a hundred thousand soldiers. Who will be leading the first contingent? That will be Jochi and I, but... In truth, a messenger came the other day. Jochi has asked for more time to return due to illness. Illness? Jochi cannot return due to illness? So ill, he cannot obey my order to return? But Qasar, I do not understand. Prince Jochi was in excellent health. What? Jochi is not ill? Far from it! Just ten days ago, when I was there on business, he was enjoying a hunt at the head of the party. Please, reconsider! Jochi would never plot to rebel against you! Move aside! Genghis! You would doubt your own son and accept without question the word of a peddler? Jochi has violated military law most grievously! If I forgive Jochi, how am I to set an example for the rest of the army?! Once, long ago, you killed your younger brother. I could not have forgotten had I tried. With these very same bloody hands, do you mean to now kill your son? How much of your family's blood must you spill to be satisfied?! I... meant to have Jochi experience relentless battle, struggle and suffer in solitude, and from there, I wanted him to grow into a man who could bear the burden of Mongol. I... wanted to strike down the Jin along with Jochi. That was... my atonement... to Jochi... for once having tried to kill him. If the blood of the Blue Wolf is the blood of a butcher, I have no need of such blood. Where is Jochi? Prince Jochi is resting in there. Neglecting his duties, lying abed in the middle of the day! Get up! Are you Jochi? What happened? Prince Jochi was struck by an enemy arrow that was poisoned and he took a sudden turn for the worse three days ago. He can no longer even see now. How can this be?! Ill! He was ill! If he was so critically ill, why did you not say so?! According to Prince Jochi, if it became known during a campaign that the commander had become ill, it would greatly tempt the enemy to attack, so we were ordered to keep it secret at all costs. Additionally, we were told that his father... His father, who is Khan of the Great Mongol Nation, was not to be burdened with unnecessary worry. Jochi... said that I was not to be worried, did he? Khan... Genghis Khan... Jochi! Khan... Call me "Father." I am your one and only father! Jochi! I received your royal command for the attack on the Jin, but I could not take to the field. I am sorry. Father... Will I... be able to die as a Blue Wolf? You must not die! Jochi! You must not die! Jochi! Father... Thank you... very much. Jochi! You... still had this thing? Jochi, you must forgive your father for having been a fool. Forgive me! You are truly of the Blue Wolf's blood! Beyond a doubt, you are a child of the Blue Wolf! Jochi! My child, Genghis, was a man who did not know what it meant to rest. What was it that drove him to such lengths? Years upon years of hatred for the Jin... Clearly, his ambition was fueled by far more than that. What was that something more? Khan. Even though you have united the Mongols, do you not intend to stop warring? I will go on as far as I can. With every land I conquer, more borders between nations will vanish. People will travel freely and trade will flourish. Cultures and customs will be honored and all will live well. But make war and there will be bloodshed. Kulan, that is bloodshed that cannot be helped to ensure that no further blood need be spilled. Jochi. You will lead our charge. To become the Blue Wolf... Now is the time... when I become the Blue Wolf! Attack! Have faith in that distant voice and go on You were born gripping your destiny Run with all your might down that crimson path Upon this earth that leads to the heavens Because of love, I'll be forever more with you O blue light, o passionate dream I would gladly offer up all that I am, forever To believe innocent blue For even the worst pain No matter what it takes, cannot steal away my bond with you You will surely learn at the end of your journey The proof that flows powerfully within your body O blue land, o white sky Our will to live together shall always be here To believe innocent blue Beyond time Though darkness may fall upon our eyes, we will run past it all We will run past it all You are a wolf, I am love You will chase your dream and I will become the glittering wind If a man learns that there is a dream to be had there He will surely conquer lofty peaks and dive to the depths of the ocean To the ends of the earth and sea I shall follow you Look into the distance Send your spirits soaring to the ends of the earth Far off into the distance Rather than fearing to lose Upon my heart, I will engrave this miracle that brought us together If a woman learns that there is love to be had there She will surely devote even eternity and traverse any distance To the ends of the earth and sea I will follow you Look into the distance Send your spirits soaring to the ends of the earth Far off into the distance All to you...
