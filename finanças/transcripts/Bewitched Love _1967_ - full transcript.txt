Candela! Candela! Candela! Bewitched Love Where are you going? Candela... The sea speaks because the wind moves it. It speaks without God's permission, like the condemned. Don't listen to it. You are desperate. Only I can take you to him. Come. Come with me. Candela! - Candela! - Come. Follow me! Again? What did she say to you? Why don't you rest for a while. Leave it, I'll finish it. Just a little more. Listen to me, Candela. You can't keep on this way. - Who's there? - It's me. - Who? - Juan. Come in. No, I have to run. I just got in. And my father? - He's staying out till tomorrow. - Tomorrow? Yes, there was a ton of fish. We wanted to finish it. He told me to let you know. - Thank you. - No problem. Close the door. Don't worry. Sit down. You can talk as if we were alone. Did you bring money? Cut. Knock three times. I've come because I'm afraid... terribly afraid. I feel as if I'm followed everywhere. It's coming closer. As if it were always behind me. I know what it is. What's looking for me is dead. I heard his voice coming from the cemetery. I'm sure of it. He wants to take me with him. - Calm down. Last night I felt I heard him calling me. Calm down. We'll see about that. Do you have a relationship with this person? - Yes. Did you give in to him? I see. He deceived me. He deceived others. Everyone knew it but me. But then I couldn't escape. He drove me crazy. He threatened me. He was capable of anything. Love. Blood. I see that he died. - They killed him. - Bad business. Things are getting messy. It'll be hard to get free of this spirit. Violent deaths call out to the living. But he can't get out of the tomb. Don't forget it. What was his name? - Diego. You're surrounded by swords. Diego's spirit won't leave you in peace until someone pays for him. I know I will have to pay for it. But I'd rather die than go on like this. Leave it to me. I need more time to read the cards. Right now, you know what to do. Come tomorrow. Why are you here? I'll let you know. Just what we need, filling her head with this nonsense. She came to talk to me about her dead lover. Bye. See you later. - Hey, how are things? - Nothing new. I'll walk with you. - Give it to me. - Stop it, he's in a bad mood. Anyway, I know everything that's going on. Well, almost everything. - What do you know? - What's between you and Candela. And what's going on with her. Where'd you get all of this? Are you spying on people? Who, me? Who were you talking with? No one. I figured out some things. Can any doctor cure it? Cure what? Candela isn't crazy, she's afraid... Afraid of a memory. No one can fight against a memory. You love her a lot, don't you? I can see it in your face. Even when you're dancing it's obvious. Couldn't you at least try talking to her? Why are you so worried about me? Because I know things are going poorly. Where are you going? - I have to go. - Wait! Don't go! Listen to me. - No, I have to go. Goodbye. Leaving already? Yes, I have to go to the dock. You just got here and you're leaving already? We have to go back out to sea. It's always one thing after another. It's always been that way. They work us like dogs. Goddam it. - Then you're not coming back tonight? We'll see what they say. Well, I'm off. There was enough fish for a week. We had to come back to drop off the load. - Of course. - Why do you say that? - No reason. Well, see you later. And take a look at the net. Don't forget. Don't worry. Goodbye. Candela. Wait. - What do you want? - He's waiting for you. Come. He wants to see you. If you don't come, he will come find you. He's close. Do it for me. You know how Diego is. I beg you. Wait. Don't go. Hurry up! Candela. Candela. Candela. Candela. Hey, what's going on? Candela. Candela! Candela, it's me. They're coming for me. They're after me. Please, let's get out of here. - No one's after you. Calm down. - Why are you here? - There were people surrounding your house. Like they do every day. Why did you come here? What are you looking for? Leave me, I beg you. Let's go. - What are you afraid of? - Leave me alone. What do you want? - Stop thinking about him. Forget what happened. As if it had never had. - Quiet. I know what you're thinking. No one's going to bring it up. Not me, not anyone. You can always start again. You have to start again. - I can't start again. - Don't say that. The past is the past. Leave the dead in their place. - Diego isn't dead. - Candela. He's after me. He won't leave me alone. That's just your imagination. It's not real. It's not my imagination. I feel him coming closer. He wanted to get into my room. He woke me up forcing the window. You must have been dreaming. Don't dwell on it. I can't help it. It's stronger than I am. Try to. I'll help you. Let me help you. - I think I'll be fine alone. - Sure. - What is it? - Look. He must have used it to break the window. I found it in the broken glass. That's what woke me up yesterday. - Whose is it? - Diego's. He had one like this. It's just like I imagined it. Who cares what people think? - What do you mean? - Now I know that I can help you. A knife means a man, and that man we can fight. - It's definitely Diego. He's dead. Someone else must have the knife. Do you know any of his friends? - I don't know. He hung out by the salt mine. The guy you're looking for was killed a while ago. He only came here when he had nothing else to do. - Like what? - Bootlegging, girls. I don't know. - Was he a friend of yours? - Of course not. He had few friends. Do you know any of them? No one showed up after he died. Apparently he had no family. - Did he live nearby? - Yes, I think by the bridge. He used to go to the chicken coop. Ask for the man who handles the cockfighting. Forgive my asking: was he family of yours? - No, why? No reason. Since he died, only the police have come asking for him. That's how it is. You don't know anyone close to him? He wasn't liked around here. After what happened, it's no wonder. By chance, have you seen a knife like this? It looks like the ones Lorenzo sells. At least it looks like it. - I heard I could find one around here. I already told you what I know. People here don't like to hear talk about Diego. At Lorenzo's he was known well. Lorenzo spent time with him. I even thought they were friends. Two of a kind. - So Diego used to go there often? Good morning. She's the mother of the brothers who killed Diego. But she doesn't want to even talk about it. They've had enough of the police. She lives nearby with her husband and four sons. Diego got along well with women. It seems he was involved with the daughter. The brothers went looking for him... they're not bad people... - Where was this? - There, in the house in the corner. Thank you. Are any of your brothers around? Hey! - Who are those four? - No one. Four drunks. - Come back for the bottles at 10. - Okay. - Hey there. - Eh? Where is Diego? - I didn't catch that. What'd you say? - Where is Diego Sánchez, your friend? Turn on the light outside. Don't you know? They killed Diego. He wasn't a friend of mine. At most an acquaintance. - Sure. I'm looking for friends of his. Everyone knew him around here. But friends? - I've got a message. - Seriously? And what message is that? - It shouldn't matter to you. - Of course not. It'd only interest a friend of his. Someone very close. Antonio! - Hello. - What luck. Emilio's with us. He's quite the guitarist. But I'm sorry, I can't. - Very well. - Another time. - Do you sell switchblades? - No, not right now. They're popular these days. - Do you know who bought this? It could have been anyone. Some days I sell three or four. - Bad business. The price varies with the wine. I can get one if you want. - Thanks, but I'm fine with this. Doesn't matter that it's broken. - As you like. I'll come back another night. Maybe we'll talk then. I won't forget. See you later. Lorenzo. I told you not to come at this hour. What is it? - Someone was looking for you. - For me? What are you saying? You heard me. He knows something. What does he know? All they know is that I was found dead by the wall. I put my clothes on him and did in his face. Unless you slipped up. - Me? No. But this guy bothers me. He's not looking for you. He's looking for someone who knows you. He brought a broken switchblade. He asked me if I knew you. He's going to come back another day. - A switchblade? - Did you lose yours? - Must've been when I was outside Candela's. - Enough with Candela... Get out. Don't let anyone in. I'll go as soon as I can. I'm sick of being cooped up with her. But I'll be with Candela soon enough. She needs a firm hand. - You've gone too far. Leave her alone. You need to get out of here. It's my business. You deal with the nosy boyfriend, you heard me? You don't want them to catch me. Now go. If he comes back, play it cool. Don't give anything away. Understood?. - All right. Thanks for letting me know. Soledad. Close the door. Who have you been talking to? I only told Candela that you wanted to see her. From now on, keep your mouth shut. I swear I only talked with her. What'll happen if someone saw you? - Get off me. No! I won't let anyone take you away. Get off me. Goodbye. What do you want? To talk with you. - All of you? - No. They've come to hear what you have to say. Why are you asking about Diego Sánchez? His friend tried to open a window with this switchblade. I want to give it back to him. Which of you lost it? Let go of him. Speak clearly. What do you want to say? That there's a coward trying to scare Candela using Diego's memory. - Candela is none of our business. - Diego killed our brother. I should have started here. We have nothing to do with it. But if you try to fool us, you'll end up like Diego. If you're with him, you're against us. Don't worry. I'm not with him. Tell me where Diego is. I want to see him. I have to tell him something. - Who lives with you? Whose is this? - Don't touch that. Don't touch anything. Those are his things. They're just as he left them. - And this? Don't try to fool me. Who's sleeping with you? - Stay away! It's still warm from his body. Diego's dead. Why did you say he is waiting for her? Tell him he's not dead. Tell him he's here with us. And this? Also Diego's? Answer me! That's for when he comes back. Take it if you want, but don't touch his things. It's true she brought it. Leave it be. All right, let's go. We won't get anything here. He wants you with us. He wasn't looking for you. It's nothing. - Get all my things together. - Are you going somewhere else? - I don't know. Do what I told you, you fool. Tonight I'm going to Lorenzo's to make him talk. Him, or someone else. Sooner than later, I'll find the shadow who's been following you. I'll make him come out and face me. We'll go together. They know me there. I used to go with Diego. With my help, it'll work out. It's always the same guys. Sometimes we stayed up together all night. It's my turn to dance. He took me outside, to the place behind the shop. Where they light the fire to scare away the mosquitos. He watched me dance until I couldn't anymore. It was if my dancing drove him mad. So I stayed with him. - Quiet. You can't forget it. If he were still alive, he'd come this evening. - Not anymore. I swear it frightens me. Frightens me terribly. - Forget it. - No. You have to believe me. [You can't imagine what it was like.] Now it's different. I have you. You're everything to me. - What is it? - He's there. Who's there? Where? - Diego. In the bushes. Give me a little. You. Come over here. Wait till quarter after. I'll accompany the ladies. It's better if I don't show my face around here. Bravo. Now that's what I call dancing. You're the same as ever. What a dance! They call you Paloma. It's true. - Hey! Play the fandango. - Come on. - Go on. Play the fandango. - Let's go, Paloma. - Play it and I will dance. - Diego liked to watch you dance those. Let's go. We'll see how you do. And you. Put some heart into it. That's it! That's how he liked it. - Mind your own business. - Bah! - Let go of me. - Don't get involved. Get out of here. What's going on? She's remembering something. Leave her be. Diego! Let go of her! Let's get out of here. - Let go. - No! Put away the switchblade, coward. No! Let's go. Let go. I gave you quite a shock. Forgive me. What's going on with Antonio? He hasn't been to work in two days. How do you know? They say he got into a fight at Lorenzo's. I was with him. He doesn't remember hurting his arm. That's something. You love him a lot, don't you? - Yes, a lot. If you love him so much, why don't you leave here with him? - Where'd this come from? - I know what's going on. It's better if you leave here. - You also love him. Yes, goodbye. Think on it. - Where's my father? - He just got off. He's coming now. Candela. Listen to me. Tonight at nine, go to the pillars and wait for me there. We're getting out of here. I know you don't want to, but start getting ready. Don't play any games. I say this regarding your friend. Tell him he won't survive if he crosses me again. Hello. - Why are you late? - How are you? Fine, tomorrow I'll just be like new. Why are you so late? I've been thinking. Thinking that we should get out of here. Away from all this, where we can live peacefully. Where's this coming from? We shouldn't have to run. We'd be together, and no one could bother us. You know that's impossible. Diego will plague us as long as he's alive. He has to pay for what he's done. - No! I'd die if anything happened to you. - Don't worry. Next time he won't get away. You'll go to prison. Whatever happens, I'll lose you. When it's settled, we'll go. There's no other way. Yes there is. That we never see each other again. By what's dearest to you, I beg you. - You're what's dearest to me. - What time is it? - Nine. Why? No reason. Hold me close. Just like that. Shut up or I'll kill you. There you are. That's how I like my Paloma. Answer me. Why didn't you go home? I told you to shut up. Are you going to behave? That's it. You told your friend, didn't you? No. I swear. I swear I didn't say anything. That's good. You wanted to be with me. To feel me again. No! It's okay. Wait for me at the same spot, by the pillars. I'll be at the dock. We leave at midnight. But get it straight, if you bail on me again, you can kiss Antonio goodbye. I'll deal with him tonight. And this time for good. I'll be there. I'll go with you. - Of course you will. It'll be just like it was before. Promise me you won't do anything if I go with you tonight. Like what? We'll leave and that's it. I'll be there by the pillars. Goodbye, Paloma. You can go now. Hello. I want to talk to you. - Come in. - No, it'll only be a moment. - Did something happen to Antonio? No, I came to ask you to deliver a message. - Antonio? - Yes, I can't see him tonight. Tell him not to wait up. I'll be gone for a few days with my father. We're leaving on the boat now. - Why didn't you tell him? I didn't have time. I'm asking you a favour. Well? And tell him I'm very sorry I can't come. I love him a lot. What is it? What happened? You're keeping something back. - So you won't do it? - I'll do it if you tell me the truth. I have to go for his sake. Don't ask me any more. I wanted to see him. But I won't ever again. You're going with the guy who fought him at Lorenzo's. So that nothing happens to Antonio. He'll be waiting for me at midnight by the pillars. Tomorrow I'll already be far away. - Lucía! - I'm coming. - Can you imagine how Antonio will feel? - I don't want to think about it. He'll never forgive me. But time heals all. You can help him. That's why I came. Look after him. Thank you. Tell him what I said. Tell him the truth. - Lucía, what are you doing? All right. Don't worry about it. Good luck. - Goodbye. - I'm coming! What are you doing here? Looking at you. Looking at me? I can see that you have strong arms. You'll need them. - What are you trying to tell me? I know where to find the man you fought with. What are you saying? What I said. If you want to find him, go behind Candela's house at midnight. You'll have to go by the cathedral. - How do you know that? I already told you. I know everything. - No, tell me the truth. - Let me go. Fine. I heard it at Lorenzo's place. I overheard them talking. Don't believe me? Promise you'll take Candela away tomorrow, whatever happens. She's home alone. Her father left in his boat. Listen, Lucía... Thanks for everything you've done. But don't get yourself in trouble. Who, me? How could I get in trouble for that? No one saw me. Promise you'll be back. I swear. You'll see, she's not coming tonight. Candela is not the same. She's not coming. She's not like me. What are you doing? Where are you going with that? - Where do you think? - No, Diego! Don't go! Take me with you! - Get off me. Take me with you. Let's be together. I'll do anything you ask. Don't leave me alone. Diego! No, Diego! - Why won't you shut up for once? I won't let you go. You. Where are you going? Why are you out this late? - Go away. Why are you here? I told you it's better if you don't see me again. Where were you going? You knew Diego would be coming by here. Go away. Leave me alone. - Where are you going? - Leave me alone! Waiting for someone? Yes, go away. What are you looking for? Nothing. You were going to him, weren't you? He'll kill you. I know he will. He told me he would! - Where is he waiting? - He'll kill you. - Tell me where he is. She won't come. It's pointless waiting. Candela won't come tonight. What are you saying? How do you know? She told me. She told you? Talk to me. Wait for her tomorrow at the same time. Her father won't leave until tomorrow. Why didn't you tell me before? Answer me! I wanted you to see for yourself that she wouldn't come. It's already past midnight. Do you believe me now? Don't go looking for her. You'll ruin everything. Tomorrow she'll be yours forever. Don't ruin it. No, Antonio! Don't go! He'll kill you. No! Don't go! This time you won't get away. Come at me if you dare. Come find me. I'm waiting for you. Come closer. I'm waiting. No. No, Antonio! Don't. Don't. Enough. Don't go. Listen to me, Diego! Come back! That way. Come on. Go ahead. Come on.
