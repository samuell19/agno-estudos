[TELEPHONE RINGING] DEBBY: Doctor Leeder's office, may I help you? Oh, Miss Carson. One moment, I'll see if the doctor is free. [MUSIC PLAYING] [HEAVY BREATHING] Miss Carson? Sorry to keep you waiting. The doctor is working on a patient right now. Would you care to hold or call back? Don't worry, you can trust me. All right, goodbye. [MOANING] CHRIS: Oh, yeah. [MOANING] Oh, yeah. DEBBY: That was your true love. CHRIS: I heard. Oh, you're so good, doctor. CHRIS: You're such a good patient. DEBBY: I try. CHRIS: What did she want? She said she was in the neighborhood, wanted to know if you were free for lunch. CHRIS: Mm-hmm. She asked me not to tell you. She said she wanted it to be a surprise. Oh, that's fine. As a matter of fact, she should be here any minute. What? Come on and get dressed, you sneaky, little bitch. [GIGGLES] [MUSIC PLAYING] CYNTHIA: That was a wonderful lunch, Chris, I loved it. CHRIS: I'm glad you liked it. CYNTHIA: Did I surprise you when I called? CHRIS: You have no idea how much. Hey, look at the time. We'd better get out of here. CYNTHIA: So soon? CHRIS: Come on, let's get out of here. CYNTHIA: Chris, you have no adventure in your blood. Just look at all these interesting, old relics. CHRIS: Junk. CYNTHIA: Oh, Chris. CHRIS: Oh, come on, let's get out of here. It's getting late. And besides, I have to get to the hospital. Just for a minute. Come on. [FOOTSTEPS] Look. Look, Chris, "Grimm's Fairy Tales". I haven't seen it since i was six years old. Look. Very nice. [CREAKING OF WOOD] [EERIE MUSIC] [BELL JINGLES] [MUSIC INTENSIFIES] Chris? CHRIS: Cynthia. Oh, there you are. I wondered where you were. [CREAKING NOISE] Did you buy it? What? That Grimm thing. Did you buy it? No. I thought you and it were inseparable. The old guy who runs this clip joint had other ideas. What do you mean? Can you imagine the old fraud wanted $100 for it? What's $100? I know what you mean. But you don't have to rub it in. Even if I am, as you say, filthy rich. Since we're about to be married and you're a struggling doctor, I intend to begin living with a little frugality. All right? I'm proud of you. Now, if we don't get me out of here and over to that hospital, you're going to be married to a ditch digger. [RAPID KNOCKING ON DOOR] Go away, we're closed. CHRIS: Please, let me in! There's a book. SHOP OWNER: Come back tomorrow. It'll be here tomorrow. No, please. It may be gone tomorrow. I must have it, tonight. All right, all right. [GATE SQUEAKS] [TENSE MUSIC] [BOOKS CRASHING AGAINST THE FLOOR] [GATE SQUEAKS] That's the book you want? Yes. Yes. How much? SHOP OWNER: Let me see. What's the book? It's a very old book. - Yes. How much? SHOP OWNER: Maybe it's not for sale. What do you mean, not for sale? It must be. - It must? Well, yes. Well, I mean-- I want the book. I'll pay you anything for it. Come on, old man. How much? Anything? Yes, yes. SHOP OWNER: You seem so obsessed. The book is not for sale. - What? The book is not for sale. CHRIS: Look, I want that book. The book is not for sale. Go away. SHOP OWNER: [GROANING] [EERIE MUSIC] My god, what have I done? [DOOR SLAMS CLOSED] [QUIET MUSIC] As I believe, and am about to prove, the human personality has two sides, good and evil. This may not be apparent in most, but nonetheless exists. I have delved into this subject for some time now, and tonight the chemical components I have amassed and mixed into a drug. I shall intake upon myself as my own Guinea pig. In this manner, I expect to free the other side, a hidden personality. [GROANS] CHRIS (VOICEOVER): The potion is, by now, beginning to take effect, and I feel a strange conflict within me, as though I believe the other side of the personality is attempting to break loose and come to the surface of my being. [GROANS OF PAIN] I feel a great, constricted sensation within myself-- a battle of the senses. [SHOUT OF PAIN] I faint of vertigo. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAMING] [INTENSE MUSIC] [LOW GROWLING] [QUIET, EERIE MUSIC] [DISTANT DOGS BARKING] [FOOTSTEPS ON PAVEMENT] That's all right, buddio, you're safe now. What? They've gone. Are you on the run? Of course not. Yeah, I'll bet. If I were on the run, you'd be in danger, right now. What do you mean? Well then, if I were running, I'd probably kill you just to keep from being given away. I didn't give you away when they passed by, did I? Why not? Because I'm on your side. Thank you very much, but no matter. No matter? I told you, I'm not on the run. But thank you. My, you're a pretty girl. Thank you. Would you like some fun? Fun? You look like a man of means, able to pay for your pleasures. Do you think you'd be able to satisfy me? Just try me. Let's go. Where? I have a cozy, little place. [EERIE MUSIC] Show me what you have to offer. What? Strip for me. [MUSIC CONTINUES] [LOW GROWLING] [YELLING] [SCREAMS] [INTENSE MUSIC] [WHIPPING NOISES] [SCREAMS] [WHIPPING AND SCREAMS] STREETWALKER: Stop! Stop it. Stop it! [PROLONGED SCREAM] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [HEAVY BREATHING] Shall we make love, my dear? Let me go! You must be balmy. Do you think that you could satisfy me? Please, you don't have to pay. Just let me go. But you promised to give pleasure. Please. Just a little pleasure, as you promised. Please. Please let me go. You're hurting me. [CRIES] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [CRYING] STREETWALKER: Please, please, let me go! You're hurting me! I'll let you go when you are satisfied. Do you think that I could satisfy you? I can go when you satisfy me? Yes, of course. Once you're satisfied, you're free. Do you mean that? Well, yes, of course. [MOANING] Are you satisfied? Yes, yes. Oh, yes. Are you? - Almost. [LOW GROWLING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [CRYING] STREETWALKER: No! No! [CRYING] Oh, god. No! [SCREAMING] [LOW GROWLING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] JERRY: What do you think? Strangulation. I know, I know. I mean, who? Well, judging by the marks and the placement, I'd say a medical man. JERRY: A medical man? Very interesting. CHRIS: Yes. DEBBY (ON PHONE): You have a call from Miss Carson, doctor. Hello, there. CYNTHIA (ON PHONE): Oh, hello, love. How's the future Mrs. Leeder this morning? Oh, Chris, I can hardly wait. CHRIS (ON PHONE): How long must we wait? Oh, two weeks and two days. CHRIS (ON PHONE): Why wait? Oh, silly. I have so many arrangements to make. And don't forget, tonight is our engagement party. CHRIS (ON PHONE): Why can't we run off to Vegas? Oh, silly, and miss the party? CHRIS (ON PHONE): No, I'm serious. Oh, Chris, you're impossible. Look, I have to go now. I have 100 things to do. And don't forget, 8 o'clock tonight. CHRIS (ON PHONE): OK. OK? I love you. CHRIS (ON PHONE): I love you too. Bye, bye. CYNTHIA: Good afternoon. Sorry, lady. I thought that door was locked. Lady, what I mean is the store is closed. CYNTHIA: Where's the old man who was here yesterday? - Did you know him? - Know him? Well, what I mean is, are you are customer? You certainly never seem to say what you mean, do you? JERRY: I don't know what you mean. There you go again. JERRY: Really, Miss-- Carson. JERRY: Yeah, well, you see, the old gentleman that owned this store, he passed away. And I'm here trying to settle the estate for him. I'm his lawyer. CYNTHIA: Oh, dear. I'm sorry. Did you know him. CYNTHIA: On the contrary, I never saw the man before in my life until yesterday. He had an old book that I wanted, "Grimm Fairy Tales". Unfortunately, my fiance, who hates extravagances, talked me out of it. But you decided that you wanted it anyway. CYNTHIA: That's why I'm here. Can I have it? I'm sorry, but under the circumstances, nothing is for sale in the store. That is, at least until the estate is settled. Well, if I can't have, I guess no one else can either, right? That's right. Oh, it's all right. I won't need it for about four years anyway. I don't think I understand. CYNTHIA: There you go again, Mr-- Russo, Jerry Russo. CYNTHIA: I'll explain. I thought it would be nice to have for our children. Chris and I are getting married in two weeks. And even if we started to make babies right away, the book wouldn't be practical for at least four or five years. Now, do you understand? I think I do. CYNTHIA: Good. Then it's all settled. If I give you my number, when the estate's all cleared up, you'll call me. Perfect. Oh, dear. I'll have a new address in a couple of weeks. I better give you Chris's office number. Now, you won't forget to call me, will you, Mr. Russo? No, you can count on it. Good. Thank you. It means a great deal to me. Thank you again. Bye, bye. - Bye. Doctor Christopher Leeder. Doctor? [DOOR OPENING] That's the last patient of the day, Chris. CHRIS: Good. Do you feel like taking up where we left off this morning? I'd love to, but we don't have that much time. Remember, I've got that engagement party tonight. Yeah, I forgot. Hey, we do have time for a quick drink thought. Would care to make some? Well, if that's all you've got to offer, OK. Hey, on second thought, never mind the drinks. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MOANING] That workout this morning just warmed me up, so you better not tease, because I'm in a raping mood. Never, dear. [GIGGLES] [LAUGHING] Come on. You coming? Come on. [LAUGHTER] [KISSING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, Chris. No. No, no, no. You're too slow. [LAUGHTER] Come on. Oops. You got money. Keep the change. [LAUGHTER] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [MOANING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [GIGGLING] [WATER SPRAYING] - Are you ready? - I'm ready. Ah, it's cold! [LAUGHS] You heard me, it's cold. [LAUGHING] OK. Well, here's some soap. Turn around. [GIGGLING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, I'm getting sopping wet in my hair. CHRIS: You don't have any [INAUDIBLE] do you? DEBBY: Not unless you're asking me. Ahh. [LAUGHS] [MOANING] [GIGGLING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Let me get your back. [SLAPPING SOUND] [LAUGHTER] What's your hurry? We've got time for one more session before you have to leave. Oh, hey, baby. I've had enough for one day. What do you think I am, a machine? You said it, I didn't. Hey, we have no time. OK. If there's no more action, than I'm going to get dressed-- if I can find me clothes. After the initial shock the body takes on a feeling of well-being, the sensation of whatever the world of our society can offer. The chemical potion converts the mortal being into a strength that is able to handle and have an insight into whatever may come. People appear as they really are. It is said, if we could only see ourselves as others see us. But this enables us to see ourselves as we really are, whatever. The formula I use is composed of the following ingredients. [EERIE MUSIC] [MORTAR SCRAPING] That's my last grenadine. [SCREAMING IN PAIN] [COUGHING AND GAGGING SOUNDS] [A MALE SCREAM MORPHS INTO A FEMALE SCREAM] [MUSIC PLAYING] [CRIES] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [DISTANT CRICKETS CHIRPING] [DISTANT VEHICLE TRAFFIC] [GROAN] [COUGHING] [EERIE MUSIC] Maybe it was too strong. The ingredients could have changed their chemical components over the years. Let's see. Two parts silybum, five drops cornathia, one ounce dromedine. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? CYNTHIA (ON PHONE): Chris? CHRIS (ON PHONE): Hello, darling. Don't call me darling. Where were you last night, Doctor Leeder? CHRIS (ON PHONE): I don't know. - What? CHRIS (ON PHONE): Believe me, I blacked out when I was getting ready, and the next thing I knew it was morning. CYNTHIA (ON PHONE): And you didn't hear the telephone? CHRIS (ON PHONE): As I told you, I blacked out. That sounds very strange to me. I think you should see a doctor. CHRIS (ON PHONE): No Cynthia, don't. There'll be a messenger over to your office this morning with your ring. Our engagement is off. Please, Cynthia, try to understand. CYNTHIA (ON PHONE): Oh, Chris, you can't Imagine how embarrassed I was. The excuses, and-- the humiliation. Oh, god. [SINISTER MUSIC] I will have to bar myself in my chambers for I fear as this other side of myself takes over and emerges to the surface it had begun. And where the story will end, only nature can take its course. The evil Mr. Hyde ventures out and wreaks havoc on the populace.

You desire excitement by the look. Let's see how you cater to the feel of it. [GROWLS] [SCREAMS] [EVIL LAUGHTER] [MUFFLED SCREAMS] [GRUNTS] [MOANING] Doesn't it feel good, little vixen? Is it what you expect? Would you like more? [SCREAMING] [DULL THUD SOUNDS] My god, what a maniac. But I'm no better. I killed for this book. [DOOR OPENING] [DOOR LATCHES CLOSED] [FOOTSTEPS] That must have been some party, lover. I didn't go. Oh, Miss Carson must have loved that. I found out how much she loved it. She called. It's all over according to her. All over? The engagement's off. Oh, there go all our plans. Now what, eh? I'll call her and apologize. She'll cool off pretty soon. You hope. We do. Well, why didn't you go? Honey, you wouldn't understand that. Try me. Another woman? You might call it that. [DOOR CLOSES] Oh, I'm sorry, sir, the office doesn't open until 9:00. Did you wish to make an appointment? Actually, miss, I'm not a patient. I'm here on a different matter. Is Doctor Leeder expected? DEBBY: He hasn't arrived yet. JERRY: Well, what time do you expect him? DEBBY: About 11:00. JERRY: Well, I'll come back then at 11:00. By the way, do you know where I can reach Miss Carson? - Is anything wrong? - No, no. It's just that-- it's just kind of a routine thing. Do you have her address? Yes, I think so. Here it is-- 1473 Lakewood Drive. Thank you very much. You've been very helpful. You're welcome. [DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES] Just what did happen last night? What do you mean? That was a detective. He wanted to see you. - What about? - He said routine. What did you tell him? I told him you weren't here yet. That's a good girl. He'll be back in an hour. He asked for Cynthia's address too. Did you give it to him? Of course. He'll find it anyway. Look, come here and tell mamma what you did last night. Believe me, nothing. After you left, I finished my drink. I guess I had another. Then I blacked out. It's as simple as that. I woke up this morning, and that's all I can tell you. I see, one of those, I don't remember what I did last night things. Look, believe it or not. Now, would you leave me alone for a minute? I'll get right back to you. OK, whatever you say. But everything points to you being in some kind of trouble, Chris. Lean on me, I might be able to help you, no matter what the problem is. There's no problem. Now, will you leave me alone for a minute? Hmm? - Suit yourself. [MUSIC PLAYING] Why does he want to see me? Must be about the bookstore. How did her find out? I promise. it'll be my last extravagance. That's it-- the book! She went back for that goddamned fairytale book. That's how he found out. First thing, I've got to hide. But where? Hide-- yes, the girl! I'll hide as her. They'll never know, and that'll give me time to plan this thing out. Let's see, first dose lasted about 14 hours. I'll make enough to last a week. [DOORBELL RINGING] Why, Mister-- JERRY: Russo. Oh, yes, the lawyer. Won't you come in, Mr. Russo? I have something for you. Oh, the book. How wonderful. Miss Carson, may I prevail upon you to answer a few questions? - Yes, of course. But I can't imagine what you'd want to ask me. Well, your fiance, Doctor Leeder, I dropped by his office today. Why? Well, he was with you that day in the bookstore, wasn't he? Yes, he was. Well, do you know if he knew the owner? Do you remember if he talked to him that day? As a matter of fact, no. Chris, was very anxious to leave. He was bored with the whole thing. Well, do you know if maybe he might have went back later on? No, but-- well, I'm sure he didn't. He had no interest in the place. Has he been acting what you might call strange since that day in the book store? Yes. JERRY: Oh. Well, how do you mean that? Well, for instance, last night with our engagement party and he didn't even come. I called him all night long, and there was no answer. And when I finally did get a hold of him this morning, he acted as if nothing had happened. But I questioned him about it, and he said he blacked out, and had no recollection of the evening before. That is sort of strange. Has anything like that ever happened to him before? CYNTHIA: No, of course not. What's wrong? Has he done something? Why are you asking me all these questions? It's nothing for you to be concerned about really. As a matter of fact, I'm supposed to see him right now. So if you'll excuse me, I'm going to run. Thank you very much for your help. Hey, what about the book? What do you mean? How much do I owe you? Oh, that's a little gift. [EERIE MUSIC] DEBBY: What's the occasion? Somebody's birthday? Cancel everything for today. I'm expecting a Miss Hyde. Send her right in when she comes, OK? DEBBY: OK. Has that cop come back yet? DEBBY: Not yet. - Good. If he does, send him away. I'm going to leave in a few hours out the back way, and be gone maybe a week. Miss Hyde will be staying in the apartment while I'm gone, OK? DEBBY: And new love? CHRIS: Hey, don't be an idiot. She's an old friend. Yeah. Please believe me, Debby. I'll explain everything to you later. Just remember, tell that cop that I'm out of town, and you don't know where. Could you, sweetie? I guess so. But when you get back, it better be good. Better than ever. That's not what I meant. [GLASS CLANKING] [EERIE MUSIC] [GROANS OF PAIN] [SHOUTS OF PAIN] [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm Miss Hyde. The doctor is expecting me. - Yes. Won't you go in? Thank you. [DISTANT TRAFFIC NOISE] Is the doctor in? No, I'm sorry. He have to leave town for a few days. If you'd like to call back later, perhaps he could see you then. Look, miss, I have a search warrant here. All right, be my guest. Can I help you? I'm looking for Doctor Leeder. He had to leave town rather suddenly. Do you know where he went? No. Do you know when he'll be back? No. I'll be back. Thank you. Where's Chris? MISS HYDE: Obviously not here. I know that. Look, it's none of my business, but just what connection do you have with Chris? MISS HYDE: You're right, it is none of your business. But I guess there's no harm in telling. Let's just say we're close friends-- very close. I gathered that. Chris has told me a lot about you. Come, sit down, Debby. I'd rather not, if you don't mind. Oh, but I do. Come, we'll have a drink. You know, Chris particularly wanted us to get together. He speaks very highly of you. I'll take a rain check. [LOW, SINISTER MUSIC] Now, let's have that little talk. Ow! [CRIES] [SCREAMS] MISS HYDE: Be still. DEBBY: I can't breathe. I can't breathe. OK, OK, I'll be still. [CRIES] [MOANING] You sure know how to talk. That's because we both speak the same language. [DISTANT TRAFFIC NOISE] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [DOORBELL RINGS] DEBBY: Oh, I wonder who that could be. MISS HYDE: Well, there's only one way to find out, get dress and answer the door. [MUSIC PLAYING] [DOORBELL RINGS] [RAPID KNOCKING ON DOOR] Miss Carson? Is Chris here? No, he's out of town. Please, I must see him. Look, I don't know where he is. Oh, look, I understand. If he's in there, just tell him I'm here. - He's not here, believe me. - I see. Miss Carson. Mister Russo, Could we go somewhere and talk? Well, yes, of course. My car is right here. Well, who was it? Cynthia Carson. She was looking for Chris. Why didn't you bring her in? I don't know. You fool. She'll be back. How do you know? I know. Fine. Why don't you get out of here. I'll see you tomorrow. It's early, I-- Get out of here! [DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES] I really am worried. I told Chris on the phone we were finished. It was his whole attitude, as though he didn't even care. I expected him to call me back. And when he didn't, I decided something was wrong and went over there. The nurse receptionist said he was out of town. Then I saw you. I've been watching the place all day. CYNTHIA: What about the rear entrance? I got a man back. CYNTHIA: Then there is something wrong. I'm afraid so. CYNTHIA: Tell me, please. Well, that bookstore owner didn't just die, and I am not a lawyer. I don't understand what you mean. JERRY: He was murdered. I'm Detective Sergeant Russo. I was assigned to the case. But what does Chris have to do with all this? Well, after the sudden disappearance, we kind of thought maybe he was implicated in some way. What are you going to do? I want to talk to him if we can ever get together. Maybe I can help. That's exactly why I wanted to see you. So here's what I have in mind. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CUE STRIKING BALL] What would you like, baby? Do you mind, sir? Sure, what will you have? What have they got? They've got beer. Make it a beer then. Two beers, please BARTENDER: Two beers. You knew around here? You might put it that way. This is a pretty tough place, you know? Seems to be. A nice girl wouldn't even hang around this joint. MISS HYDE: Oh, I'm nice all right, depending on how you look at it. SAILOR: Looking for some action? MISS HYDE: Could be. SAILOR: Think you can handle a big guy like me? I've handled bigger guys than you. When I said big, I wasn't talking about that. Now, I am interested. SAILOR: What's the rap? MISS HYDE: Let's see how good you are, then we'll talk privately. It's a deal. Come on. You got a place? No, what about yours? My ship? I guess not. SAILOR: Come on. I can help you. [MUSIC PLAYING] [QUIET MUSIC] Here? And old port in the storm, baby. Haven't you ever heard of a knee-shaker? I guess I'm about to. [KISSING SOUNDS] [SCREAMS] [GRUNTING] SAILOR: You like that, baby? Did you like to feel it? Did you like to hold it? [GASPS] [CRY OF PAIN] [DISTANT TRAFFIC NOISE] [KNOCKING] CHRIS: Who is it? It's me, Cynthia. Oh, Chris, please let me in? I must talk with you. CHRIS: Go away. There's nothing to talk about. According to you, we're through. Now, go away, and leave alone. Oh, Chris, please, I want to help you. CHRIS: Go away. [MUSIC PLAYING] He's there, but he wouldn't let me in. All right, now you go on home. I'm going to go in there and talk to him. Now, go ahead. I can't understand it. The stuff doesn't have the same effect. It doesn't last as long. Maybe it's that I'm growing immune to its properties. [KNOCKING AT THE DOOR] JERRY: You can open the door, Doctor Leeder. Oh, it's you again. JERRY: I told you I'd be back. I still want to see the doctor. And I thought I told you he was out of town. Yeah, well, I have reason to believe that he's here. Look, mister, I have no idea when he's going to be back. Will you please just go away. I have a search warrant, miss. If you insist. [FOOTSTEPS] [SINISTER MUSIC] Care for a drink? At least you'll get something out of your search. No, thank you. I know, maybe he's under the bed. Why don' you look under here? Nope, not there. How about up here. How come you didn't look up here? Maybe he's hiding up here. And you are very funny. Oh, and you're very strong. [EERIE MUSIC] There's something wrong, something I don't like about this. What's in there? I don't know. JERRY: We'll find out. MISS HYDE: I told you, he's not here. What's all that stuff for? How should I know? There's a lot you don't know. First he's here, and then he is not here. I've had a man posted outside all day long. I'm going to tell you one thing, if he comes back, I'm going to get him. You can tell him that little thing if you talk to him no matter where he is. And there's one other thing you can tell him, that I suspect him of something very wrong. And now I'm sure. Can I leave? You can do whatever the hell you want. You bet your life I will. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [PHONE RINGING] Hello. MISS HYDE (ON PHONE): Miss Carson? Yes? MISS HYDE (ON PHONE): I must see you, now. It's very important. Is it about Chris? MISS HYDE (ON PHONE): Yes. Is he with you? MISS HYDE: No, but I can take you to him. He wants to see you. CYNTHIA (ON PHONE): Where? I'll pick you up in 10 minutes. OK? CYNTHIA (ON PHONE): Yes, yes. Now, don't tell anyone. CYNTHIA (ON PHONE): No, No. I won't. I promise. MISS HYDE (ON PHONE): Fine, I'll see you in 10 minutes. Yes, all right. Goodbye. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [DOORBELL RINGS] [DOOR OPENING] CYNTHIA: Oh, come in. I have to get dressed. Oh, I hope you don't mind waiting. I'll just be a minute.

[INTENSE MUSIC] [GLASS SHATTERING] Hey, don't! [SCREAMING AS GLASS SHATTERS] CYNTHIA: My god! It's all right. It's OK. She said she'd tale me to Chris. I decided to follow her. It was a lucky thing that I did. She said she knew where he was. She knew where we he was all right. [DRAMATIC MUSIC]
