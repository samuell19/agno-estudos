WARSAW, 1999 Lucky son of a bitch. Your size. Nice kicks. You're fucking crazy? Not now. - Yeah, now. - Faster, man. Relax. We're fucked. Run! Freeze! Move your ass! Let go! He knocked my tooth out! Who in Poland has all the teeth? - Good morning, Mrs Woźniak. - Morning. Turn that off. Chill, mum. I wrote something for you. So you'd relax a little. Look in mother's eyes, she's suffered a lot Many tears she cried for her son Did and would do anything She cried so many times, it happens often So make sure, kiddo you put your name In the right style. Everyone's after money Don't say I'm lost What's with these shoes? You've got money for new shoes, but not to share living expenses? I've said it a thousand times. At home you wear slippers! I've got something for the home. - Enjoy. - Look me in the eye. You look away, you lose. Yo. Neighbours are having an ongoing party? They're fucking poverted. Or perverted. Whatever. - Łysa? - Show lady some respect. - Go get some cigs. - On my way. Long time, no see. Hi. I heard about your hurdle race. You are quite a sportsman. Good you didn't break your legs. Sorry, Łysa, there's no shop nearby. Seriously? - Maybe we go further... - Sure thing. Get in. Who's that chick? Łysa. - That Łysa? - Yup. She has friends in Ząbki. Worked with Granpa. - Are you fucking me?! - You would feel it in your ass. She's hot. Wonder how many she banged. A lot. Likes younger dudes. Then I should get interested. C'mon. Let's get high. Chada is not jealous, stays in your psyche Doing your thing You're limitless Welcome to Poland, where they kill for cash Stab you in the back when giving you a cake And pouring you a drink. Yo, man! Hi, sis. Yo, Pablo. Why so fucking slow? I'm fucking tired. I start my shifts at 7 am, even on Sundays. What's up with your tooth? Give me a break. Lost it at work. I'm broke. What's the job? I pack plates into boxes. - How much do they pay? - 4,20. - For one plate? - Per hour. You're shitting me! - And? - They didn't pay anyone yet. - The whole staff is waiting. - And? I can't go fucking public. I'll steal some plates and sell them tomorrow. And get the fuck out of this country. - Where to? - Germany. You can go with me. Sounds like communist meddling. Expectations, salary on time, what fucking else? The system has fucking changed. It's capitalism. Time to act on your own. Time for young and resourceful ones. All that matters are drugs, not canned meat. Fuck it, I'm good here. Then why you're going around toothless? And you, Chada? What's you're up to? What's up? Got something good? I always have top notch stuff. For twenty. Put in on my tab. Fine. But pay me back! - I'll have some coke next week. - Not my thing. Yo, man! There's one thing you give and take It's not about money, it's about respect There's one thing you give and take It's not about money, it's about respect There's one thing you give and take It's not about money, it's about respect There's one thing you give and take It's not about money, it's about respect Lout will be lout, forever and ever, Amen Stay with your bros and you'll be safe Making hip hop is our mission Help your mate, so he won't hit the bottom Let him know that you're more than a beggar What counts is respect You don't follow? Then you'll get slated You were raised for nothing Begging and crying won't help Begging and crying won't help I trust my judgment even when I'm wasted I know who's loyal and who's a scum I know respect and it won't change I rhyme for my bros, that's what I love Got nothing more to say, Klima - respect! That was good. Come by tomorrow at 11 am. We'll talk. Be there. OK? Man! That's the guy from the TV. He hosts some show. You feel that? Nice one! Yo. Black sun rising over us Over roofs, over our family rules I... - It's ok? - Very nice. You got something more? Anything else on the table? Lowlife knows no lie, only the truth - Cause one man's lies... - Enough! Sit down and listen. It needs some work. Some smoothing up. Too much swearing. Here's the plan. You'll rap. I'll take care of songs. You'll get a songwriter. Make some numbers on women and summer holidays. And in a month you'll appear in "Blaise's Bike". Sounds good? Now listen. Something like that. That's how I see it. We gotta do something about your vocals. You'll take a couple of singing classes and we're golden, right? Come on. Wanna try? - Yes? - Thanks. As you wish. There's a deal. They brought new goods to Olszynka. Razors, irons. Irons sell well. They always fucking do. Because every fucking businessman wants his shirt ironed. Am I right? Last time wasn't enough? - It will be different this time. - Just drive! I'm out. Think about it. What time do you get home? I had something to do. Look at you. What happened? What kind of business was that? Personal. You work night shifts too. I have to go. Be at the hospital at 3 pm. - Got it? - Yes. - Don't be late! - You better hurry. - Take care of this. - Will do. Something extra for the family. Home appliances are selling well. Aren't you forgetting something? You gotta make a living. I could use a man like you. You have something to offer? In a couple of weeks you can own a car. Pablo's already said "yes". Pablo? I'll think about it. Think, for fuck sake. But don't overthink. Chada and overthinking? Cigs again? You don't even smoke. I don't wanna look at you, you fuck. - It hurt? - Good one. "It hurt?" I don't smoke. If theoretically there was a job, what theoretically would we do? Surprise me. I'm here, mum. Good. Wait. It's crazy busy around here. Communism fell apart and what? Chicken butt. They destroyed everything. I trusted them. And I didn't? They're worse than looters in 1945. At least they didn't steal land. Where did you work? Rosa Luxemburg factory. 35 years. - Light bulbs. - At least you got enlightened. - At least. - Why are you late? Fucking nice shades. Watch your language. Got them from a patient. Look at you! Couldn't you dress nicer? People are looking. Stay. Chief? Coming! That's my son. The culprit itself. If he's hard-working like you, we'll hire him. He can start today, we'll do paperwork tomorrow. Don't let me down. I throw you in at a deep end. I heard you're a rapper? My son listens to that music. To Vienio? No idea, but he listens to hip hop. Come on, get change. Move out of the way! Shall I repeat or send - an official decree? - There's a line. I don't forbid you to stand in it. What a nation! 40 years they were queueing and can't do otherwise. Still, need someone to think for them. Boy? There's a line. Don't keep me waiting. Take this fur. I'd rather not leave this fur in here. Should I go to the restroom, it might get stolen. So you won't go anywhere. I'll make an official complaint. Do you know who I am? Ticket, please. Next, please. Yes, Pablo? Thanks. - Remember the drill? - Yeah. You need to stop. Your back wheel is loose. Better pull over. Right rear wheel. Shit! Stop! You're late. - I've just... - Joking. Just joking. You're funny. When we'll get money for the car? What car? Just joking. I'm recording and need cash. To pay for the studio. You need to wait. But I got this. What's that? Moron. Take it. You sell it, you'll get 3%. Five. Fucking lunatic. Five. You know what you're doing? Get the fuck out. See me as lost, not a stupid one I know where my problems are coming from In the streets I learned how to make money I counted the cash, not school degrees Alcohol and drugs, I rely on myself now. Only I can fight my own disease I often ask you, God for a piece of advice More often, I keep away from your light I know perfectly well that my lyrics and rhymes Don't make me any better than you I'm just a human, don't wanna change the world It's hard to persevere and meet my goals I'm fighting myself, my hands are heavy I struggle to join them for a prayer I lack humility, my heart begs for mercy I know I'm no role model to follow I'm fighting myself, my hands are heavy I struggle to join them for a prayer I lack humility I know nothing 'bout faithfulness I know I'm no role model to follow - Yo. - I'm busy, man. Join us when you're done. What we were up to? Up to no good. I'm more of a West Coast... kinda guy. - Jersey? - West Coast. But I respect Diddy. It goes for itself. And you? Wanna hear something? - Wanna hear something? - Shoot. I don't give a fuck. Man... Let's go to sleep, 'cause nothing interesting will happen here. Tomek? What's going on? Tomek? Oh, God! Tomek? Tomek, I beg you. Such a disgrace in front of deputy mayor. Do you realize that because of you we've just lost a grant for new windows? Patients complain. It's freezing in here! Show me this fur. Here it is. 30 years as my employee. I could get you fired in a flash. I'm sorry. One more thing. I reported it to the police. But... Don't think he'll get away with it easily. I'll take the fur cost out of your paycheck! That's against Labour Code. It meant something in communism, now we've got capitalism. Is it a hospital or a company? A company! And a costly one! We need money! WARSAW, 2001 Hey there! Got a lighter? - Sure I do. - Thanks. Here you go. It's tricky with this wind. Let's try again. Nice ride. Nothing beats V8 sound. Thanks. Live to the fullest, be an artist to the end Stacking loot, take as much as I can Own a private airport and more than one car I dream about it as every other guy I wanna live like Messi, have loads of cash Be a fucking Count Monte Cristo style Not to wear any masks, peel out down the street Live and abundant life What did you do this time? Police came. They want you at the station. You can't drive, cunt? I really didn't mean that... I'll get you, you fuckers! Spend money like Tyson and have no regrets Live every day like it's my birthday Live to the fullest, brag about my successes For once feel like I owned a Ferrari Have no problems at all and always be on top Damn! Leave it! Open the door! Have no problems at all and always be on top Drink champagne and smoke with my crew I want a fairytale life, my own private Eden I want a red Ferrari and my own gun collection Be wherever I want and never worry again WARSAW, 2004 Nice ride. It's yours. - For doing a great job. - Really? But watch out for thieves. Invitation. For a wedding. I'm getting married. Dude, your tyre is flat. - What? - Your tyre is flat. - What? - Your tyre is flat. Whatever. You know better than to mess with me. Best wishes to newlyweds. Health. Money. And... Kids, of course! But most importantly, money. Uncle Stefan will take care of everything else. Thanks. All the best. For breakfast tomorrow. After the wedding night. Meet Szajba. You're Chada? We like to eat, right? Listen. If you love freedom, do everything to avoid jail. But live as if every day was your last one as a free man. Good one. Trust me. I'm on temporary leave. - Be in Nieporęt in an hour. - I wouldn't miss it. I was nice, bought her cigs. C'est la vie. Chicks don't like nice guys. Keep that in mind. Now you look good. Groom. Good evening. Tomasz Chada? And what if? Eat shit. Come with us. Come on. Open your mouth! Feels good? You'll tell us everything! He said anything? Nope. Plays a tough one. You can't drink before swimming. Open it! Nothing? Halo? Breathe! This girl, Łysa. I'm the only one bold. Sure? And now, how many do you see? Answer me! How many? - Say it, you fuck! - Great reflexes. Bitch. Chief inspector, Żaneta Braniszewska. Circumstances have changed. OK. Enough foreplay. Now you'll tell us everything. Otherwise... you'll be charged with possession and drug dealing. And theft of deputy mayor's fur. See, bro? You won't get out of jail quickly. You know what they do... to pretty chicks like you? Shall we do a line? You want to? You love that. There's plenty. No one will know. You want to, you fucker? He said anything? Not yet, but he's about to. I'm taking him over. Say what? Take him to the nearby bar. My treat. Hurry up. See ya. Return it to the dispatcher. Stop staring and get the fuck out. - What happened? - What did you do this time? Police searched your place again. Leave it! What happened? If I had a son like that, I'd kill him! Shall I call you Mrs Łysa now? Why look like shit? You're high? Mum's in hospital. Had a heart attack after a police search. It happens. There's a gig. - Revived cars. - Passats? Bulk quantities. Old and new ones. Bring them to the Tinsmith to Goździków Street. Repeat. My mum's barely made it. I'm not asking for a favour. You owe me. Lowlifes, that's what we are One is a car thief, the other is a smuggler We walk arm in arm, always in the name of God We seek the truth and illegal profits I'll be there in a sec. No worries, mum. We seek the truth and illegal profits You're at the crossroad, every way leads to jail Politicians are liars, so we never trust them Here you steal That's what we're after Times have changed, no 3:10 train to Yuma We've got our views and laugh at law and order Always live against the rules Open the fucking door! Did you go to the bank to get my paycheck? Money should be on my account. Yes. - Oh, God. - Slowly. Now, take envelopes from the cupboard. Split money for rent and gas. - Electricity and phone bills. - I'll take care of it. - OK. - No worries. - Done. - I'll run the water. What the fuck? One hundred for a living? What's up, loser?

WARSAW, 2005 You are not raising your leg. - Which one? - Left one. - Do I need to? - Wait. - I'm Tomek. - Michał. Can I try? Stand in the middle. Your board is smaller than mine. You lean on one leg and slide the other. Crouch down. And jump. Exactly! Now slide this leg as if you stepped in poo and wanted to wipe it off. That's it! Hold on. That's great. I'll hold it, try to jump off this leg. Once again. Step on the tail. One more time. Good! High five! - Wow! - You saw that? You were great. Look. I'm doing it. Careful. I owe you something for the lesson? Mr Instructor? 300. Just joking. Flowers will do. Or dinner. You're fucking awesome. I'll be rich and famous too. But you need to know one thing. - Hip hop is my number one. - Really? Where does this put me then? - Somewhere. - I'm being serious. By my side. You want some? No, I'll have a drink.

There are two of us, one nice and organized Other not suited and a bit derailed First keeps his word and is a smooth talker Other make promises, but never calls back First avoids parties, stays away from troubles Other calls his dealer and smoke another one First wakes at dawn and hits the gym Other wakes at dusk, feeling like a failure First one records in a studio and cleans his place Other is never clean and records shit First greets neighbours, has a healthy diet Other starts a fight and eats junk food First saves up money and does people favours Other spends everything, sinking into debts First enjoys a book and asks if you're free Other vulgar and rude... Are you listening to me? Is anybody there? Michał, go out for a moment. Maybe you should find a normal job. I'm sorry. That's your work. I've offended you, my prince. Cause I've asked you to pay the bills? Buy food from time to time? Clothes for the kid? His name is Michał. I have a job. Making an album. You're making it since fucking ages!

I could have left. We wanted to surprise you. And you did. Can I use my phone? Which number? Who should I call? Last dialed number. And I'm fucked. Don't move. Officer Zapolska, Central Anticorruption Bureau. Who are you calling? Someone who will teach you manners. Make that call. You're getting soft? What now? No one answers? He was 28, living in slavery and pain Quickly he lost all of the control You have a smoke? Go fuck yourself. He took hard drugs, guy got him addicted He was hopelessly drifting in that fateful river Had another problem, his father was a drunk He blamed him for ending up in a rehab He didn't hear anyone laughing Had problems with people that had no hope Was afraid of dreaming, he chose a street life But was always full of doubt He had enough, raised his eyes to the sky She was there and told him to jump He did as she said, he wanted to die There was no turning back We will bring you prawns in a second. Thank you. Good evening. How can I help you? Your room is ready. One moment. Room 316. Fifth floor. Problems with the lady? Police? Not sure if that's relevant, but there's a drunk man who uses someone else's ID. Don't leave me now. I'll do anything. I can check tickets in trams. I'll do whatever you want.

My mum works here. Worked. Left six months ago. I got you best producers, sold out tickets and now what? - You'll hold my mic. - Fuck! I need a doctor! Calm down. I woke up yesterday. What the fuck did you just pull? Cops are watching you. DA issued a warrant for the arrest. They're waiting for you to get better. What can I do about it? Listen. You barely made it. Let's say you got crazy because of this. I've already talked to a lawyer. - He'll put you in a psych ward. - Like some lunatic? You prefer jail? - Where are you going? - To the chapel. - Not possible. - I'm barely walking. I wanted to thank God for being alive. It's against the rules. Back to your room. We'll go together. Don't pull anything. Understood? Holy Mother. Holy Mother. My dear mother. You came to me. I thought you abandoned me. Look at that halo over your head. You're so beautiful.

You're not gonna leave me this time. Lord is my shepherd! I have everything. Lord is my shepherd. I have everything. He let me lay on green pastures. Calm down, mister. Easy. Try to relax. That's right. Relax. Just try to chill. Your friend came by, but the chief didn't let him in. Did he say his name? He did. Pablo. You've got nice friends. One for your friend? No. One for my future wife. You're missing her. Why should I? You're right next to me. Hi. Aren't you bored in here? Not anymore. You wanted something stronger. I got you this. A toast for your future wife? You know what did you just take? I always know. Maybe it shouldn't be mixed with alcohol. It's best when mixed with alcohol. Not there. Chada! Come on! Come down here! We're going to Germany. We'll be filthy reach! What the fuck? It concerns Chada. Don't sleep, you nuts, take your pills and work your ass off! Take your pills and work your ass off!

Make some noise for this dude! Can't hear you. Shall we go on? Shall we? Chada, Chada! Not until recently my life was a disaster I was living a total madness Broken marriage, problems with law Try to realize that Cops came for me in the morning But I never told why, where and who A fucked up phase Lies, robberies and thefts Shit is getting thicker in these streets That take away our hopes Like one body sometimes you lost a will to live I was naive, my partner screwed me over I'm blaming myself, not whining about it It got hot, I went into hiding If I let you down, then please forgive me If he says something, he means it He tells how it is and never complains He doesn't claim he has it under control When taking a line fourth day in a row He's one of a few who sees hip-hop As his autobiography and sets of laws He has some hardcore stories to share That's what I wanna hear, so, Chada, go on, man! Make some noise! Blue sky above, music playing within us I go on with my shit and I can't stop Lines are full with anger, no wonders You won't stop us, don't even try that Blue sky above, music playing within us I go on with my shit and I can't stop Lines are full with anger, no wonders You won't stop us, don't even try that "Chada comes from another planet, where no diseases, that decimate Polish rap scene, exist.
