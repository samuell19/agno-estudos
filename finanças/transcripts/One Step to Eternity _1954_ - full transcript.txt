ONE STEP TO ETERNITY I saw something falling from the terrace up there. I was watching the thunderstorm. - It just went "plop". - They should prohibit it. - What? - Jumping from windows. - You can hurt somebody that way. - You're right, it's very selfish. Who is it? Jumpers don't usually introduce themselves on the way down. Move along, ladies and gentlemen, move along. Does it amuse you to look at corpses? Come on, move along. You can't stay here, Mademoiselle. Clear the entrance, ladies and gentlemen. Go on. Several days earlier on the upper storey of this luxurious building two men were looking around the magnificent terrace. The one on the right is William Jordan, an American and UNESCO civil servant. Tonight he's leaving for the United States. He sold this flat to his friend Larry Roques, who's actually called François, like you and me, the head of information at the major weekly newspaper "Le Panache". For him journalism is nothing more than a front. Larry Roques is a man of affairs, and his affairs are diverse and numerous. He had to pay a high price for this flat. 8 million, according to the rumours. I'll settle my account in dollars next month, in New York. Will it suit you? I'd rather be paid in francs, today, in Paris. - Don't be silly. - Where will you find 4 million? I'm engaged to one of the richest heiresses in Paris and you're asking where I will find 4 million. What about Maggy Lang? She's tipped me off on a sensational deal. Be careful, Larry, don't lean on it. The railing is loose. - I should have had it fixed. - That's quite a drop. Don't forget to have it repaired. It could be dangerous. I'll telephone my repairman tomorrow. What's that down there? Your future residence. The Panthéon. "To the great men, the grateful homeland." You know, I'd prefer to get the honours while I'm still alive. The concierge came to take my luggage down. That's quite a drop... Quite a drop... Say, Larry... - Yes? - What about Véra? What about her? Until proven otherwise, she's still your wife. Did she agree to a divorce? She will. I have it well in hand. Say, the neighbours aren't too inquisitive, are they? There are only company offices here. They all close at 6 PM. Nobody will see what you're up to on this terrace. You can have moon baths here. - When are you leaving? - At 10 PM, from Orly. - Will you be back? - That's a state secret. - Going on a holiday? - I'm getting married. France isn't France without a lawful wife. - Will we have dinner together? - No. This is my last rendezvous with Paris. - Do I know her? - No. - Feeling down? - Yes, I am. And why shouldn't I? I'm leaving many memories behind, you know. - You won't forget to forward my post? - Don't worry, I won't. So long, Larry. Take it easy. - Goodbye, Billy. - No, stay here, don't see me out. If I leave alone, I won't feel like I'm leaving permanently. It was then that he decided to kill her. He thinks about what he'll do. He sees what he'll do: he'll commit murder. And that safety rail will be the key component. Quite a drop. He'll push her. Yes, he'll push her. He'll start the record player, at night, when the offices are closed, at the moonbathing hour. He'll push her, and the record player will be playing blues, slow, very slow. It'll be a perfect crime. Impeccable. Is it you, Véra? It's Larry. Good evening. Do you know why I'm calling you? To tell you that I've got it. No, not the flu. Jordan's flat. The terrace, the Champs-Élysées, the Arc de Triomphe. My congratulations. You're inviting me to your house-warming party? - I'm not really sure... - Yes, accept. Yes. Yes, Larry. OK. Yes. Very well, I'll be there on Friday. Yes, yes, Larry. Friday at 7. Excuse me? Evening gown? If you like. What are you saying? I'm saying that it won't be an ordinary house-warming. What? Yes... Yes, I'm still marrying Cécile Germain-Thomas. And we'll get a divorce, as we agreed. In a friendly way. That's right. We'll have a friendly divorce. You still agree to the conditions of our little arrangement? Yes. Yes. 10 million at once. Well, not literally at once... That's right. And 10 million on the conciliation day. I think it's rather a lot. Whoever lives, will see. Did you hear what he said? "Whoever lives, will see." So what? That's just an expression. Of course I'm alone. Who do you think I'm with? My guess is, with someone who's holding the other earpiece to his ear. It happens. Well, see you on Friday. Good night, darling. Good night, my little Véra. Hello? Yes. Is it really you, Larry? Of course I recognised your voice. I was working. I'm just surprised. It's been so long since... Would you come over to my place this Friday night? I'm giving a house-warming party. Yes, I've moved house. To Jordan's flat. Do you remember it, Pussy? What? No, nothing. I... I'm OK. It's just strange to hear you calling me Pussy again. Yes. Really? An evening gown? The green one? You still remember the green gown? Yes, I still have it. OK. Very well. Yes, I know the address. Goodbye, Larry. What? Yes, I'll remember to wear this gown. Hello? It's Larry Roques. May I speak with Mme Maggy Lang? - Good evening, M. Larry. - Good evening. - A Scotch? - Yes. Somebody telephoned you five times. - Someone who didn't wish to say their name. - I know. Mlle Germain-Thomas has been here. She'll come again. Oh, yes, there's also a letter for you. You are wanted on the telephone, M. Roques. It's the same person. From the Prefecture of Police. Hello? Yes. But of course, I tell you... Yes, that's right. Mario Mirador. Women are crazy about him. At least, my wife is. He is? But that's too good to be true. He's selling drugs? You're certain? He must've just gotten his whistle. A dry martini, José. - Is M. Roques here? - M. Roques is in the telephone booth, Mademoiselle. - Are you deaf? - Why? Haven't you ever heard of one-side parking? - I'm a young girl, Mr Policeman. - Let me see your papers. - Would you like something to drink? - Be careful what you say. But I'm not saying anything offensive. I'm offering you a drink. This round's on me. Champagne or martini? That's enough. You're coming with me. - José, tell M. Roques I'll be right back. - We'll see about that. Cécile Germain-Thomas, dowry of 500 million. Dad controls 2 daily and 4 weekly newspapers. The way I see it, it'll be this copper who gets a ticket. Mlle Cécile has got into trouble with a policeman. What a pretentious policeman! It's the first time a man has refused to have a drink with me. In Switzerland I had a drink with our postman every morning. But a Swiss postman in his uniform, - that's different. - You'll end up losing your driving licence. - I'll start taking the tube then. It must be fun to travel by tube. There ought to be a lot of lechers there. - A Scotch and a baby. - Or else I might hire a chauffeur. Dark-haired, with a livery and a little moustache. Take note: I'm having a house-warming party this Friday. - At Jordan's place? You've gotten that flat? - I have. It's not bad as a bachelor flat, but it'll be rather cramped for us to live there together. - Does it have a swimming pool? - I don't think so, I would've noticed it. - Dinner jackets and evening gowns. - Will there be many people? Constance, Véra, Maggy. Constance, Véra, Maggy. Marvellous. And to crown it all, we'll announce our wedding to these ladies. Oh, Larry, I adore you. You know, I had a serious talk with Toto about our marriage. - Toto? - Yes, Germain-Thomas. My dad. - He's against it? - Absolutely. He said he'd rather have a tax inspector in his office - than you as his son-in-law. - I knew he would. But when I told him I was expecting a baby... your baby... - Thank you. - ... he was moved, and said that my mother had pulled the same stunt. - Did you know about this? - No. But I had my suspicions. He also told me you had a bad reputation, that you deserved it, and that the whole thing had to be done quickly because of the baby. - Perfect. - And that the sooner I got married the sooner he'd be rid of me. Oh dear, I'm late and we're having Machin over for dinner. - Machin? - The former Chairman of the Council of Ministers. Love me? I love you too. Mme Maggy Lang isn't back yet. Very well. How much do I owe you? 3 units for Rome, 1 for London, 7 calls in Paris. 4,200 francs. - Excuse me. Here. - Thank you, M. Roques. Mme Maggy Lang is waiting for you in her car. Did you see it? He tore the cheque stub right in front of me. - And the complaint? - He'll withdraw it. - Maggy, you are... - I know. - How did you manage it? - He owes me a lot. - He knows we're together in this? - Yes. - Ah. - I helped him make his fortune 5 years ago by obtaining some licences for him. - Did you sleep with him? - I think I did. Shall we go to your place? But it can still be proven that I cashed that cheque. - What a little coward you are. - Put yourself in my place. It was smart, what you did. And for 500,000 francs. - I had no other choice. - Don't worry, he signed a receipt for full and final payment for me. - Do you have it? - What? The receipt. I have it at home. Want to go and get it? OK. We're going home, Louis. I adore you, Larry. You disgust me a little, but I adore you. Tomorrow morning we'll decide what to do about that receipt. There's still some champagne in the refrigerator. As soon as you clear the table, you're free. Tonight is an informal occasion. A family dinner. Put the record player here. No, it won't be raining tonight. Don't you have heat storms where you come from? Bao... No, never mind. On the other hand... See that safety rail? Remind me to call a repairman. It's come loose. It could be dangerous. Don't forget. It's M. Larry Roques' residence, isn't it? "Cécile." "Véra." "Maggy." Constance. Thank you for wearing this gown. How beautiful you look. It's been four years. Almost five. You haven't changed. Neither have you. The flat of your dreams... I swore to myself I'd get it. And I have. - You didn't believe I would. - I didn't want to believe. You were scared. Let's say, I wasn't as ambitious as you. Isn't it beautiful? Yes. Even more beautiful at night. What is it? Look for yourself. It's superb. I just wanted to buy one like this for my new flat. I hope it'll bring you happiness. Happiness? Thank you. See? What's wrong? I was sitting over there. - You mean... - Don't tell me you've forgotten that terrible night? - I'd better go, Larry. - What were you expecting? - That you'd be alone with me? - Why not? Yes, I was hoping for that. You see, I haven't changed. - You can go. - Thank you. You forgot your gift. Constance! Don't go. I need you here. Tonight you must be here, among the others. Stay. You'll make me very happy. You really haven't changed, Larry. - I didn't mean to scare anyone away. - That's Constance, she's shy. Just your style. By the way, it's in the bag with the ambassador, but it has to be delivered by a neutral party. - What about the commission? - Sentimental as always. Don't worry, there'll be a commission. My house-warming gift. - What's wrong? - Nothing. I was just hoping I'd be surprised to see the receipt inside the cigarette case. The night isn't over yet. I'm your guest tonight, aren't I? Let's go. Constance? Constance Andrieux. Maggy Lang. A great friend. - I'm sure you'll get along with each other. - He's always sure of everything. But I think he's right. We will get along. First, because I admire your works, - and then, Larry often talks to me about you. - Oh, does he? You're the only person he doesn't speak ill of. He respects you. I even think he's intimidated by you. - Intimidated? Larry? - Why not? Behind all his swagger, Larry is a highly-strung neurotic. Only recently I've seen him quite worried. A childishness. He was given some money. We always need money, don't we? And Larry more than anyone. Constance, if I recall correctly, you liked dry martinis, didn't you? - I still like them. - And for you, a Scotch. - Thank you. - What was I saying? - You were saying, my adorable Maggy, - that I'd been given some money. - That's right. - That's wrong. I wasn't given that money, I demanded it. - Money for an article? - Precisely. For not writing it. In Larry's case, it's not what he writes but what he doesn't write that's more profitable. How do you like my martini? Very dry but good. I don't want to stay alone with him. I have a bad feeling about all this. You're just jumpy because of the thunderstorm. For 20 million Larry will kill his father and mother. That's right. But you're neither of them. But I'm scared. It's not my fault that I'm scared. I'm telling you, you have nothing to be afraid of. I won't budge from the tobacconist's shop at the Rue Sancerre. At the first sign of trouble you'll telephone me. - Do you remember the number? - Yes, it's in my purse. I almost went without kissing you. OK, come now, that's just automatic lighting. The lights went out. Does M. Larry Roques live here? Hold on. Are there other guests? I need to fix my hair. We were discussing your propensity for carelessness, dear Larry. The most recent example is your laying the table on the terrace when there is a thunderstorm in the air. Not all thunderstorms break, dear Maggy. This one is moving towards the hills of Saint-Cloud. Do you know how much she's asking to grant him a divorce? - She's asking money for that? - 20 million. The beefcakes are expensive this year. If you'd told me Maggy Lang'd be here, I'd have brought an antidote. You look very beautiful, Véra. I haven't seen this dress. My beefcake gave it to me. - Lovely view, isn't it. - Yes. Who is Maggy talking to? Don't you recognise Constance? Oh, that's right. The whole harem, isn't it? Only the latest one is missing. We're expecting her as well. That's amusing. I actually like it better this way. Better than what? Oh, never mind. Why does she speak with an accent? To make everyone believe she's from Hollywood. And of course you illuminated the Arc de Triomphe as well. Like I do every night. So that's your little set piece? That's all you managed to find? - What set piece? - The one you want to startle everyone with. What did you decide about our divorce? - If I told you... - Well, tell me. Not now. After the dinner. I've prepared a surprise. Why is it so dark here? I haven't thought of it. I think I'll get some floodlights. They'll make the place more romantic. Véra Volpone looks rather indistinct from where I'm sitting. Yes, she is indistinct. Distinction isn't something you'd readily associate with Véra Volpone. Come closer, dear star. - Good evening. - Shall I get you some Scotch? I'd like to make a telephone phone call first. - The telephone is in the living room, on the right. - Excuse me. Hello? Balzac 52-03? Is this the tobacconist's shop on the Rue Sancerre? Hello, I'd like to speak with M. Mirador, please. Hello, dear. It's you? No, it 's all right. No. There are five of us. A strictly feminine company. There's his first wife, and also that bitch Maggy Lang. We're also expecting his fiancée. You are from the Saint-Germain-des-Prés, aren't you? Never mind. Thank you. Beautiful setting. Absolutely ravishing. Cécile Germain-Thomas. Véra Volpone. Maggy Lang. Constance Andrieux. I say, she's quite tight, that fiancée. Not yet, be there's still time. I toast Larry Roques and his menagerie. Hello? Yes. He's at the tobacconist's on the Rue Sancerre. What? Of course it's the right time. Be careful, he's most likely armed. That's right. You'll announce dinner in 5 minutes. I think you drink too much. - You'll put on weight. - I will, but not because of drink. You too drink too much, Larry. Just like the old times. "Don't do this, don't do that." That's the story of our life together. For you, maybe. I met Larry in the most banal fashion, at a press cocktail party. He had just started as an editor at the "Le Panache" newspaper. I liked him right away. Despite his confident manner he seemed shy and anxious. Forrestier, with whom he'd been in the war together, was his only friend and helped him get a job at the newspaper. It was to him that Larry owed his new position. We left for Cannes the same night. He liked to travel in a sleeper. He loved luxury. He felt a slightly naive admiration for wealth and celebrity. He was charming. I loved him. My mother was a saint, a woman who believed only in performing one's duty and doing the right thing; a woman whose sole guidance was the will of god. As a consequence, we were dying of hunger. Excuse me. I was starving for 18 years. My childhood memories are filled with hunger pangs and shame. Later I began to understand. You never told me about it, Larry. I don't like to remember it. Excuse me. To start a new life I'm ready to sweep aside everything standing in my way. Everything. If you only knew how we lived. - I was ready to do anything. - It's over now, dear. You can forget about it. - Your compartment is ready. - Here. Thank you, Monsieur. I gave him either too much or not enough. - He looked surprised. - Usually you tip them before the arrival. - But that doesn't matter. - You see, I'm not used to such things. When I think that it's you who's paying for this trip... - I'm beginning to feel ashamed again. - You'll pay me back. If you only knew how I hate poverty. Before Forrestier got me the job at the newspaper I was broke. Now you know that there is such a thing as luck. I've known this ever since I met you. - Will you help me, Constance? - Yes, dear. You won't have much to do. You'll just have to be there for me. To look at me. Yes, dear. On our return from Cannes we settled in my studio. He started calling me Pussy. Do you love me, Pussy? - No. - Liar! Teaser! Snob! Anything else? It's almost 10! I'm running late, Pussy, very late. Goodbye, dear. - I've done something I'm ashamed of, Pussy. - What is it? Is it serious? Quite serious. A delivery man will bring a package soon, a package for me. It's a dinner jacket. I need a dinner jacket, don't I? You told me so yourself the other day. - So you see... - You have no money? Yes and no. I asked for an advance at the newspaper. They said yes... And then they said no. Yes. Why are you so silly, Larry? I'm not silly, I'm... I'm just embarrassed about owing you so much money. I look good in a dinner jacket, you know. I love you. Now run along. You're going to be late. He felt so proud of his dinner jacket that he decided to have an evening-dress dinner, like they do in London. He adored everything that came from England. That's why he renamed François Roques into "Larry Roques". He was charming. The dinner jacket suited him well. Pussy, here's a riddle for you: who's the most pretty, the most gentle, the most wise, the most intelligent, the most artistic and the most tender woman in the world? You have three seconds. - One, two... - I think I have an inkling but I'm not sure. Pussy, I adore you. If I were rich, I would've taken you away this very night. We would have gone in a car, and not in a 2CV, but in an American one, supple, silent. And we would have travelled to a desert island. - You, on a desert island? - There'd be people there. And a night club. Why not? Night clubs are fun. You are the daughter of Aga Kahn, and I'm a reporter from some insignificant rag. - You invited me to a dance. - And you accepted. You're flirting with me. He was full of such silly ideas. We were happy. Very happy. - Are you French? - Yes! I was born in Bordeaux. - You're lovely. - I'm the daughter of Aga Kahn. - Alas. I already know this. - Alas? Why alas? I love you, but you're rich and I'm poor. But that's not a problem. I'll have my father disinherit me. Certainly not! That means that you love me because I'm rich. You see, you understand. And we begin again. Pussy, are you there? Are you there, Pussy? Pussy, look! Fireworks! Catch, it's for you! I'm paying you back. It's all for you. - What is this? - Half a million. But where did you find all this money? How do you mean, find? I earned it by my cunning. Get down before you break something. - How many whiskies did you have? - Three. Tonight I'm the son of Aga Kahn. I'm Larry Kahn. - I see, we're doing it in turns. Did they offer you a deal? - A great one! - At the newspaper? - No, my innocent darling. One has to set journalism aside from time to time. Tell me, Larry, where did this money come from? No, Pussy, tonight there'll be no explanations. Restaurant, dinner jacket, evening gown, night club. But most important, don't spoil my pleasure. - I fixed some deals. - What deals? Import-export of all kinds. Influence deals. It's called influence peddling. That's right. I couldn't remember the expression. I shouldn't tell you anything, really, or I'll be in for one of your little sermons. - Had I listened to you, my dear Constance... - Go on. ...we would've been dining in a soup kitchen rather than a night club. You scare me, Larry. I can't scare you because I love you. - How much? - 640. Keep the change, my friend, and give my respects to the missus. Thank you very much, Monsieur. - What if I confessed... - Now you have a confession to make? - You're very perspicacious. Swear to me... - No! Then I won't tell you anything. Too bad, because if we went hand in hand, we'd go far. Very far. To prison. And right away, the big word. That's funny, you don't want to know where it came from, but you still pick it up. You're like a clergyman. A Puritan clergyman, even. I should buy you a black fitted coat and a diamond crucifix. - Hello? - Hello, Pussy? - Yes, dear? - I have great news! - Great news? - Yes. Come right away. I'll be waiting. Love you. I will. See you soon, dear. My congratulations. You husband has been made the head of information. Has he? So that's the great news. That's marvellous. But... Wasn't it Lartelle who...? - It was. - He didn't die, did he? You could say that. Larry had him kicked out to take his place. Excuse me. Lartelle was an idiot. His work was no good. An idiot, I tell you! - You fired a man who was you friend. - I have no friends. But it was him who had them hire you here. You always spoil my pleasure. I knew you'd tell me it was wrong, that I had no right to do it. What are you? - A woman or a moral treatise? - I'm ashamed of you. My saintly mother would say the same thing to my father. In the end he listened. As a result, we were all starving. You want me to say it, Constance? I don't like the saints. I've had enough of the saints. I hate the saints! Good night, dear. I decided not to reproach him any more. And then, what else could I tell him? Almost every night he would go out without me. But I still felt happy. I was expecting a baby. He finally got himself a car. I didn't ask any questions. Still, I knew that it had cost him more than a million. Can you hear the engine? - No. - That's how it should be. We were going to a cocktail party his friend Jordan was giving at his flat. At first I didn't want to accompany him. I felt terribly tired, nervous, worried. He became angry. He would often become angry then. So I gave in. You'll see, it's a magnificent flat. The terrace rises above the whole of Paris. It's an extraordinary feeling to rise above a city. Having bought the car you're now going to buy a flat? Why not? You will perhaps tell me that I have no right to? Well, tell me that I have no right to do it! Say it! - Cognac, Whisky, Martini? - No, thank you. - Who is that girl? - Véra Volpone. An actress. - Well, she'd like to be thought of as one. - A pretty girl. She's on the prowl. She plays double: a diplomat and a Romanian prince. - That woman who just came in, is it Maggy Lang? - Yes. - You must introduce us. - Let's go. My friend Larry Roques, of the "Le Panache" newspaper. I'll leave Larry in your care. Excuse me. - I know your boss, Germain-Thomas, very well. - Do you? He'll be having dinner at my place the day after tomorrow. - Would you like to join us? - I'd be glad to. I didn't know you were here. Larry didn't tell me. I'm sorry. What a marvellous flat! My husband is crazy about it. I know. If I ever have to go back to the United States, I'll sell it to Larry. First Larry will have to have enough money to buy it. I believe in him. When he wants something... Oh, excuse me. By the way, here's Larry. She's a close friend of Germain-Thomas. It's going to be great. Isn't she the woman who poisoned her husband? Don't go repeating some silly gossip. But, Larry, we were going to celebrate our anniversary - at Montmartre the day after tomorrow. - We'll do it some other day. Place du Tertre won't go anywhere, but dinner with Germain-Thomas... - You see? - Yes. Will I have to wear an evening gown to that dinner? But, Constance, you're not invited. After an hour I had enough. I insisted that Larry take me home. He was furious. I was dead tired. She's tired, she says... You're not tired, you just hate people. And I need these people to... You're mad, Larry! You'll get in your bed all the faster for it. Please let me out. I'll walk home. By no means, you're too tired. - You didn't hurt yourself, did you? - Hurt myself? No. Where were you? Where were you? I was... - Excuse me. - You look like you've seen a ghost. You're very pale. No, that's nothing. Fortunately it was plain glass. Otherwise I would've been on my way. Whisky's making you superstitious. It's been almost three years. Three years since it happened. Larry was driving. He was drunk. I was four months pregnant. He narrowly missed a truck. The car door opened. I was thrown outside. I'll never be able to have children again. Never. What's wrong with her? Is she going to have a child as well? I sense something tragic in the air, don't you? As if there's a trap laid out for us. The only thing I sense in the air is a thunderstorm. Larry, I demand that you explain why you invited the four of us here? Out of sadistic pleasure. For him it's a kind of sport, a cat fight, with us trying to scratch each other's eyes out... I'm telling you I don't like it here. It's... I don't know, it's like we're waiting for something to happen. Look, I didn't know he had tried to kill his first wife's child. Yes, yes... Of course. Look, I'll talk to him. I wanted to die because of Igor. I loved him so, my Igor. He was handsome, rich, generous. Our marriage would have made me the Princess of Naroba. I was hoping my suicide attempt would move him and he would marry me. Yes? Oh, Igor! My darling Igor! I knew he'd feel sorry for me. My horoscope said so. - It's not from Igor? - No, Madame. This gentleman is here. He came with the florist's boy. He claims to know you. You were introduced at M. Jordan's. It's terrible. No news from Igor, that's dreadful. The gentleman wants to talk to you. He says it's urgent. Let him in. Excuse me. - Are you a doctor? - No, but you can still accept my congratulations. Failed suicide attempts always pay. Have you seen the newspapers? - I'm too despondent. - Look, you're on all the front pages, with your legs in close-up. A veritable festival of legs. They are pretty, by the way. Very pretty. That kind of publicity is priceless. I didn't do it for publicity. I wanted to kill myself for love. What did you say? I did it for Igor. I love Igor. I'll always love him. It's marvellous. It's ridiculous, it's... They're Igor's pyjamas. I'll pay you for the story of your love for the prince. - You're a reporter? - Yes. I'm an editor at the "Le Panache". The story of my love? But I can't write. What's important is not to be able to write but to have something to tell. Then your visit is very opportune. I have a lot to tell you. Do you have a pen? - Yes. - Let's begin, then. When my memoirs were written Igor had to pay quite a lot to prevent them from being published. Larry planned it that way. He's very smart, Larry. Seductive and smart. Igor paid 3 million. Larry said, very nicely, that I had everything to become successful, and he had everything to help me succeed. Larry kept Igor's 3 million for his professional expenses. He said too that we made quite a team. I already loved him almost as much as I had loved Igor. He was ambitious enough for two. We appeared everywhere together. He had just had a divorce. We made what Larry called "a perfectly Parisian couple". It was over. I stopped thinking about Prince Igor. At all. It could only end in a wedding. And it did. We married at the town hall in Neuilly. He invited the whole of Paris. Only Prince Igor wasn't there. Larry's megalomania made him do an extraordinary thing. He wanted us to go down the grand staircase, all alone. That way he was sure the photographers would get a good close-up. The same night we left for Cannes on our honeymoon. Are you ready, dear? It was my first honeymoon. I was madly happy. Our new life had a marvellous beginning. I didn't regret my failed suicide any more. He was charming and I loved him. It lasted for 18 months. One day I found out that he had been cheating on me with a certain Maggy Lang. Before poisoning her husband she had poisoned my life. She impressed Larry because she knew the ministers and ambassadors. And just like I had got my revenge on Igor with Larry, I got my revenge on Larry with Mario. He was Spanish. He had to leave his country for unclear reasons. I can't take it anymore! How nervous you are. I can't stand thunderstorms that never break. We wait and wait... It's like being threatened by something. - Threatened? - She said it. I was right just now. There's something threatening in the air. - Whom are you trying to scare? - No one. But look at us, we're all terrified. Even you, Larry, you're afraid of something. I think you've had too much to drink. Leave me alone. Scum! Swine! Break! Please continue. I love violent sports. What do you want? Who are you? Cécile Germain-Thomas. The only daughter of Gaston Germain-Thomas, the big boss. - It's not over yet. - I'll be at your disposal. I'm not like others. I won't let myself be pushed around. My apologies, Mademoiselle. - So, you're Larry Roques, aren't you? - I am. - And the one who just left? - Forrestier. Are you a reporter or a boxer? Both, as you can see. Strange, I've only been in Paris a week and twenty people have already told me to keep clear of you. And for that reason you decided to meet me? But you're bleeding. - Where do you come from? - Lugano. I studied in Switzerland because it's very expensive. I'll go and get you some antiseptic. Don't go. He brought me to a night club. It was a strange place. Maybe it only seemed strange because Larry made me drink, quite a lot. I had the impression we were alone in an immense dance hall with neither doors nor walls to be seen. It was like being in a nightmare. But I felt good. Very good. We were dancing. My first wife was called Constance. She was an angel, but she wouldn't let me live. She would only speak to me of my duty. "You must do this, you mustn't do that..." Had I listened to her, I would've been selling "Le Panache" from a newsstand at the Champs-Élysées. In other words, she was your conscience. My conscience? Why not? Yes. My conscience. So, by divorcing her, you became relieved of your conscience? No, not relieved. I still feel fettered by her, because I keep imagining what she would tell me, if she were with me. You don't strike me as an inhibited person. In Switzerland you'd be considered fit for the electric shock treatment. With Véra, it's different. Constance I admired. I still do. But for Véra I feel nothing but contempt. Are you going to kill her? Why are you asking this? "Larry Roques, a famous reporter, kills his film-star wife, Véra Volpone." I'm getting the impression you're fond of murder stories. It must be fascinating to dance with a killer. Your lady's in the family way. Is she? Didn't you know? - No. - Oh well. - Are you sure? - I've seen it so often, you know. There's no mistake. At least three months pregnant. Champagne doesn't agree with me. - Where are we? - Come on. - Thank you. - That's for the diagnosis. Thank you. You're very kind. You should see your doctor tomorrow. Or any doctor, for that matter. That kind of spell isn't normal. Yes, maybe you're right. Call me as soon as you're done. I'm worried about you. GYNECOLOGIST Where are you? At a bistro near the doctor's office? It's nice of you to call me right away. It isn't serious, is it? No, no, it isn't. But it's annoying. Very annoying. I need to see you. There's something I need to tell you. I too have things to tell you. I haven't slept last night. I've made a discovery. A strange discovery. Shall we have lunch together? - Hello, José. - Hello, M. Larry. Have you seen Mlle Germain-Thomas? - She's in the telephone booth. - Thank you. No, I won't be able to be back for lunch. Believe it or not, Cécile, but it's happened. To me, Larry Roques. Do you know whom you've turned me into? A schoolboy. An inexperienced boy who can't sleep because a woman smiled at him. It's too silly. I'm angry with myself but I can't help it. I've been knocked out. - Too silly indeed. - No. It's wonderful. No, Cécile. You're too rich. I would've liked you to lose your fortune, I would... Excuse me. - Cécile, I would have... - Couldn't we sit down? Excuse me. I would have liked to see you down-and-out and unhappy, and to be able to tell you: "Cécile, I'm here. I'll always help you." - Let's get married. - I'd love to. I'll work, I'll do anything. But it'll be no good. The wheel of fortune. Thank you. Something terrible has happened to me. You lost 20 thousand francs playing canasta? Don't laugh, it's serious. I'm pregnant. - You're charming. - I've been to a doctor. But, Cécile, you're 18 years old. To get that way you have to do certain things with a boy. Exactly. What are you saying? It happened during a mountain trip. In a cabin. - Who was it? - A student from Zurich. - Do you love him? - I don't even know his name. When we love someone, we ask their name. - That's true. - When I saw you in your office for the first time, I asked you: "You're Larry Roques, aren't you?" Cécile, I'm asking you to promise me just one thing: nobody will ever know that it isn't mine. Nobody. It'll be our secret. - Whatever happens. - Whatever happens. A terrible secret. If I told you... Go on, we're in a family circle. She has nothing to say. Don't you, Cécile? We always tell the truth when we're drunk. But nobody believes us. - I knew a student from Zurich... - Let's dance. - Let go of me. I wish them happiness. Tell me, dear Véra, do you charge a lot for a divorce? And you, dear Maggy, how much do you charge for killing a husband? - He slapped me! - She doesn't know what she's saying. - I do! He wants to kill my child! - Cécile! There's your secret. That explains her gaining weight. I'm three months pregnant and it's not Larry's child. That's true, she's pregnant. We were waiting for the wedding to announce it. He wants to kill my child because it's not his! When she's drunk she starts imagining that the child isn't mine. But tell me, Cécile, who else can be the father? Lost something? No, but... Would you like to dance? You've never looked prettier. Is it your child? No. But he's moving, I tell you. I can feel it. Leave it, Bao, we'll pour it ourselves. - Would you like to touch it? - No, I can't stand children. - Especially when they're restless. - What's going on? - Mlle Germain-Thomas' child is fidgeting. - Is he? But it's good. He'll be like his mommy, a picture of health. Thank you, you're very kind. I'd like to dance with my husband. - Jealous? - Why shouldn't I be? - Do you really want to dance? - Aha. - With your husband? - We aren't divorced yet. Are you all right with that Greek of yours? He isn't Greek, he's Spanish. Greek or Spanish, he gives good advice. 20 million for a divorce. Spain should be proud of him. My dear friend... Jealous? Oh no. I know you could kill me. You're capable of anything. I know you, Larry. But there's somebody who's protecting me. He isn't here. - He's not far. - By the time he's up here... In our times we die so fast. Careful, don't lean on the rail! - Don't you know that the safety rail is loose. - Of course I do. I've already told Bao to telephone the repairman. Why are you so scared? There's no danger. Are you sure? You're still the same. Come on, tell me I have no right to have a loose rail at my own balcony. I'll carry her over to my bed. In her condition, she's running the risk of staying the night. In her condition, she isn't running the risk of anything any more. The child isn't yours. What of it? And you used to be so afraid of becoming an object of ridicule. When you have millions, ridicule won't kill any more. - Kill whom? - Nobody. - Have some rest. Go to sleep. - I can't, I feel sick. Make an effort. How are mother and child? Cécile is sleeping. What time is it? Why do you want to know? Yes? Yes. Oh, that's perfect. Bravo. Bravissi... Hold on a moment. It's not for you, my dear. I'm listening. Yes. You're surprised? Of course. OK. See you tomorrow. I'm leaving. Why? You're not in a hurry. Nobody's waiting for you. How do you mean? I'm just saying. You know, dear Larry, there aren't enough men here. Even if only to dance with. Will you dance with me? That telephone call has surely brought good news. Yes. Very good news. Send them away. You promised me this night. Hello, Complaints department? Give me Balzac 52-03, please. It keeps ringing but nobody answers. No, it's impossible. It's a tobacconist's shop. You must give me the receipt. Do you hear, Maggy? I do. Why are you laughing? I wanted to turn on the light, but I forgot where I was and everything fell down. - That's enough. You're going home. - No, I want to sleep. Stop shaking me. - Get up! - Don't be mean, Larry. It's not my fault this baby isn't yours. I didn't know you. Otherwise... There she goes again. And what if we told everything to Constance? She already knows. Does she? Oh, dear Constance... Is anything wrong, dear? You look like a lady who doesn't know how to repay her mortgage. You're leaving? Yes, I'm leaving. Where's my purse? Oh, damn these thunderstorms that never end! We wait and wait... I went to make a telephone call. But nobody answered. I'm sure something's happened. Tell me, have you ever heard of a tobacconist's shop that doesn't answer telephone calls? I must find him. I'm sure something's happened to him. He needs me. I must go. - Not now, you'll have a drink later. - Here's your shoe. I came to inform you that Véra Volpone has left. Has she? Cécile is leaving as well. - Did you come in your car? - No, in a taxi. - That's good. Dear Maggy, I'll have to ask you to accompany Cécile. And what else? Put her to bed? Tuck her in? Sing her a lullaby? You couldn't think of anything better to get rid of me? - Now is not the time to be petulant. - Bitch! Good night everyone. Don't wait too long to call me, my dear Larry. I believe we have some scores to settle. Poisoner! Lucrezia Borgia! Do you see? He's running after her. He's afraid of her. Maggy. - You don't understand. - What? I'll meet you at your place. As soon as I get her home in a taxi. When we're married, I'll forbid him from seeing that woman. We won't have a poisoner in our circle. That's it, she's gone. With all these goings-on, we didn't have time to talk. I had so much to tell you. - Are you going to take me home or not? - Yes. Don't go, wait for me. I'll get her a taxi and come back. All right? Go on. What did you tell her, that conscience of yours? Why me? Why me? Is there anyone here? Bao? Bao? What's wrong? Nothing. I was just checking whether I could see you from up here. You look scared. Scared... no. But you tried to leave. Don't try to deny it, you fiddled with the lock. You locked me in. I didn't want you to leave. Can we go inside? I'm cold. That's true, you're shivering. Did you do that? Yes. I couldn't understand why the rail was moving. But now you do? - I don't know. - Of course you do. Come on, Pussy, make an effort. - They'll arrest you, Larry, you'll go to prison. - No. An accident. I planned it to happen in public. If it weren't for that idiot Cécile, it would've worked. But the accident will take place all the same. Behind closed doors. I've done nothing to you. You've been obsessing me ever since I met you. "Don't do this. Don't do that. You had no right to do it. Where did that money come from?" It's maddening! You spoil everything for me! And I listen and listen and listen! It's an obsession! It's not me you're listening to, it's your conscience. I have no conscience. You're my conscience. Please, Larry, think. You always listened to me. That obsession of yours... I don't know... Perhaps you still love me. What did you say? I... I still love you... Move along, ladies and gentlemen, move along. Move along, please. Did you push him? I don't know.
