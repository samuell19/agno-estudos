It was a cool party, but there was a stoned girl there. She is Mads' girlfriend, totally stoned. Don't you remember? It's true, she was a whore. - It wasn't like that. - Yes, really, she was. She was messing up with all the guys. Ask Mads. - Why do you ask me? - Isn't she your girlfriend? I don't care about what you did in the party. Nothing happened. Nothing serious. Don't you understand? I don't want to know. What are you going to do? Act as if it never happened. Have you turned to naturalism? I leave. It is good to see you again. - Do you regret leaving to study? - No. I missed you. Cheers! Let us raise glasses... For the good old days, For the fact that Kristian returned. Cheers, Kristian! Hey?! - We can talk about it if you want. - Are you trying to be funny? Then you do not want to talk. Talk as much as you want. So that Eva can hear? Eva will hear about it anyway. - She must know the guy. - Calm down, Mads. - Which guy? - Oh, some guy. What do you think, why did I come? I should never have come here. I should have remained back home. If that is what you feel. It does not work between us. You said it yourself, it does not work. I want us to separate, Mads. Its odd how things turned. What things? You and I. We hardly see each other any more. You mean less than before? We wanted to stay in contact, but somehow we didn't. Will you stay for long? When will you return? Next summer. Next summer? Wouldn't you return for Christmas? You should come. Good God! Are you OK? Do you need something? I'm fine. Take off your T-shirt. Mads! Are you sleeping? Did Mads leave to swim? Isn't he in your room? I thought he was at yours. Go away, Kristian! It only makes it more embarrassing for you to be here. Why? Didn't you take my clothes off? Didn't you put me to bed? Yes. I was awake, Kristian. I was awake when you touched me. Why didn't you say anything? Like what? Hi! - Did you leave? - I did not know if you would return. Do you think I am childish? No. Everyone think I am. It was childish of you to leave with this guy. It was childish of you to go away like that. It's not what you're thinking. It is only with Mads that it is like that. Do you really expect me to believe it? It is the truth. Perhaps it's like that now. There are guys other than Mads. I didn't know how you would react. Really I will miss you. Goodbye. Goodbye, Kristian. Do you know what I hate about you? Your hideous tennis shoes. I can throw them. Only if you want. But they are really dreadful. All right. Goodbye, Kristian. Goodbye! Why did you do that? You embraced him.
