Holy crap, guys. Holy crap. No way. This is New York, let's call a taxicab. Yeah. - Welcome to New York! - Welcome to New York! There you go. - Where are you from? - I'm from Chicago. Why did you skate all the way here? - That's a "Forrest Gump" attitude. - - Really cool. Marker. Hell yeah, dude. The first time I heard about Shred America was through Mike and Arthur from the skate park. And Arthur had approached me asking if I wanted to partake on his journey. So, I was like, yeah, why not? I got nothing to lose. It's an on the road, Jack Kerouac type thing, we just go. I'm gonna put it on my collar, I'm gonna put it up here. Okay, how's this, can you hear anything? I first heard of Shred America in the cafeteria of the community college that I used to attend. It was just, go on bike with Tony and make a documentary. I was like, okay, I didn't know what to expect. This is so fucked up, bro. - It's so bright, man. - Yeah. Was that pretty good acting, Mike? It was good, just try it one more time without. Okay. Mike and I weren't afraid of just sort of having an idea and potentially failing. It was sort of just like, let's hop on our boards, let's go, and let's figure it out on the way. Skateboarding is just a beautiful thing. It's just... It's very close to my heart. That's kinda how I met Mike, actually, is through skateboarding. We are. We just wanted to do something crazy, something adventurous, something wild. Being 20 years old, you know, you're not gonna take no for an answer. This is how you party shred style. Next question. Let's see if I can answer this one sober. When I first got on there... I didn't really know anything about it besides going from point A to point B, which was Chicago to New York City. I didn't really know if we had an actual route planned or anything like that. I kind of had assumed that it was going to be easy until I saw the carts. They were heavy as hell. I mean, they were super heavy. The carts were our best attempt at transporting all the gear that we had. And at every moment, it found a way to screw us. As far as planning the trip out, we didn't really plan too much. When you take off and do this, are you guys out there on your own, that's it? You got a GPS and you're gone, or... or do you have a car following you? You know, right now we Google Mapped it, but we are hoping to get a GPS by that time so we don't get horribly lost. The only thing that we really planned was how to get media attention, those, kind of things. Last month we've been just publicizing, sending out emails and it's paying off. - Um... - - I don't want you to be nervous because you're gonna have about a million people listening to you. Is it a million? People started taking us seriously once they started reading these articles, and seeing us in the news stories. "Hey, these guys are actually doing it." I thought that Arthur and Mike know what they're doing, but maybe they don't. After one half mile, turn left, then turn left. How long will it take you to get from Chicago to New York on a skateboard? One month. - One month? - We're guessing one month. You know it's dumb, right? Everyone says it's dumb and stupid, but we're like, "You know what? No, it's not." It's really not. No, because you're gonna get, you're doing something that's you're gonna shake your brains up. You're gonna shake yourself up. It's like, I'm gonna go to my job, then I'm gonna get a wife, then I'm gonna get married, then I'm gonna make some money, then I'm gonna retire. To hell with that. - Yeah, exactly. - Life sucks, forget about that, get out there and get hit by a truck. That's what I always say. Okay, so we didn't really establish though the path that you're gonna take, the route that you might take. - Right. - If you leave the Bean in Millennium Park today at 8 AM, - this sort of... - Yeah. - Kind of a math quiz. - Yeah. All right, what path do you follow? Because you could be killed by the Dan Ryan. - You know what I mean? - Right. - Exactly. - You may be dead already by the time you get out there. We're gonna head towards the lake and we're gonna take the bike path east... All right. Towards Indiana and we're gonna go on the bike path as far as we can. And we'll see what's going on after that. We'll have to find out. There you go. You're gonna find out. All right, Mike and Arthur leaving Chicago to New York City about 850 miles. They're gonna videotape the trip. Gentlemen, you leave about 8 o'clock this morning from the Bean at Millenium Park? Yeah, 8 or 9. Good luck, we're all counting on you. I thought Mike and Arthur had the idea and had the plan. That it was gonna be easy and that everything was going to go by like a formula. And it didn't. Man, we fucked up. That was like a fucking mile, man. We need to go that way but there's a lake right here. We're not allowed to take there? And we just biked about a mile so. Not good planning. No, not at all. This is why you plan routes. To know that the road you're on actually takes you to where you wanna go. Aw, dude. You want to avoid toll roads? We've been skateboarding for about? I have no idea. We have no idea, really, cause... Because we're lost. We weren't paying attention to the signs. For the most part, I think we did have the route planned, at least we knew the direction that we were going. Originally, when we started the trip, when we left Chicago, there's a city that borders Chicago called Gary, Indiana. And we were gonna go to Gary, Indiana. By about the third driver that told us we shouldn't go to Gary, Indiana, we decided to reroute. We don't want to go to this like place that would be, you know, potentially dangerous for us. And I think that's when we started to really get lost because it, sort of, flipped everything over on its head. Okay, so what are we doing then? What's the plan? This is... 12 goes straight... Taking 20 to 12, right? No, we're taking 12 through... No, we're taking 20 to 30... 41 to 30. This guy said we're on 41. Here's Fort Wayne. Out of desperation we bought a roadmap. And the funny thing with the roadmap was we didn't know how to read a roadmap. What's that town right there, Joliet? That's Joliet Street. It was kinda like, embarrassing for me. That's bad, man, even the birds aren't eating it. Look at how, like, bad, nasty that is. It smells like shit too, man. That's why I wanna get out of here, I've been going fast cause this place smells. Like, it's affecting the way I breathe. So we're getting out of here. Yeah. You're just hoping that you don't die on this trip. James and I, we're about five miles from our final destination. Mike and Tony, they are ahead of us and they've already got us the hotel. We will be reaching Schererville, Indiana, or Schererville, Indiana in about maybe the next hour or so. And hopefully, there near the intersection of 41 and Route 30, we will find gold. And by gold, I mean, a hotel because I'm fucking tired and we're all really tired. Almost 40 miles today, not bad. Hi, just a little sports update. A couple of nuts from right here in Chicago are skateboarding... Pay attention now, skateboarding to New York City. That's right, to New York City. We didn't think they were gonna make it out of the parking lot based on what they said yesterday. Mike and Arthur are on an excellent adventure. All Right, Mike, you left 10:30, is that correct? Yeah, we left at 10:30 yesterday. We were about an hour and a half behind schedule, but we have made it to Schererville, Indiana. Schererville, Indiana. Schererville, Indiana, wait a minute, how far is that from Chicago? It's about 40 miles away, 45. When are you taking off now? It's four minutes before eight. We're probably gonna leave around 10 or 11. - If it dries up... - Three hours from now, do you - wanna get to New York or not? - If... we actually... - What are you guys gonna do, - have a big brunch? Get going! No, the thing is, it actually rained and we see some rain drops on the window, so... We see raindrops on the window... That sucks. That's what pioneers said, when they were trying to discover the world. They set out and said, Lewis and Clark, I believe, "But now we can't get going down this river, I think there are raindrops coming in." What is wrong with you? How many minutes do you think you actually skateboarded yesterday? We... like nine hours. I'll tell you one thing, you gotta get out of Indiana, Mike. These guys ain't doing nothing, man. I should still wait until 11 o'clock to leave. These guys, they don't sound like skateboarders. Skating from Chicago to New York takes time. You only made it Schererville, Indiana yesterday. I think you're just doubting us, Johnny. No, no, I'm not doubting you... I think you are, man. He's using a lot of words that seem like he's doubting us. I believe you can do it, but you have got to have more, I don't know what it is, passion for it. Fucking asshole. Man, you gotta keep your cool. - Doesn't matter. - Be light-hearted. No, dude, they're like ragging on us, and it's like, they don't even know... They gotta understand we're filming a documentary. We're not just going. Probably saying everything we're doing to people. Saying we're staying at a hotel, or we're going to Walmart. We should probably limit the things we say to the media cause they're going to start building whatever they want. Well, they can't, like, tell us how to do this thing. It's our movie. But it's also the media and they'll eat you alive. It was like one second they were our best friends and the next second they were our worst enemy. And it got to us. So, we packed our shit, and we left. Day two, sweat. It's supposed to rain and James is about a mile away. There was definitely whispers among our friends that James wouldn't be able to make it. I fell back to be closer to James, because I chose James and so I stuck with him. Come on guys, we don't have all day! We've gotta stop somewhere and get something to drink though, for real. Like, I wanna stop at a gas station and buy a pint of water. They're at the hill. I'm sore, from bullshit. I just don't want him. He's lagging behind like shit. We'll find somebody else or something. We have a schedule and we really can't mess around. You know, we've... like this is just two days of just bullshit, to me. The one stop you guys made for me was... Yeah, but James, we don't want for you to be all the way back and like... Like you meeting up with us later because it's supposed to be four of us together. - You know? - We're not even filming that much. What if something happens to you way back there? Like, you fall, you're unconscious, and we're like, "Oh, yeah. James is gonna come." Nighttime falls, you're not back. But it's, it's I'm... I... whatever it takes, I'm always within eyeshot of you. - Like, I see you guys. - No, you're not, dude. I saw, once... - No, dude. - Once, and I had to walk up the hill, that's it. After that, I've been in eyeshot of you the entire time. - Today you've been pretty good. - Yeah. It didn't help that I hadn't prepared for the trip or that I hadn't given any effort or thought into how it would be done. Me and James are averaging seven miles an hour. He's sticking with me the whole time. You're going 14 kilometers, split that in half. That's seven miles an hour. So, if you guys are going like nine, that's fine. You guys are just a bit ahead. I knew that all he really needed was a little bit of extra time for his body to sort of adapt. And if we give him that extra time, that everything would be okay. - Bill, can you imagine that? - - Time and place. - Riding out that storm. - Few feet away. [Host] Look what happened to it. We wanna see your pictures. Any severe weather you might be experiencing or videotaped too, give us your name and your location. A brief description of what we're seeing as we get them, we will get them to television. Remember out there, with all this severe weather and more possibly today. No, isn't Columbus like in the middle, or at least a little further south? Cause we're super north and 30 is only going to take us so far. It's going to take us through Cleveland instead. So, if we're trying to get to Columbus, we need to cut further south, maybe like Fort Wayne. Barack Obama, it's around 2012. Woo! There weren't many normal days on Shred America. Oh shit! Yo, film it. If it wasn't raining, it was thunder storming. If it wasn't thunder storming or raining, we had to deal with the wind on the highway coming off the cars as they passed us. We didn't do it very smart. We would leave during the hottest part of the day and be biking through most of it. Our body, it was asking us, it was telling us, give us water. Can I get a drink of water? ♪ Shit man, it's just the opposite. Yeah, yeah. That's fucking awesome. That's way cooler than what I was expecting to hear. ♪ I'd be ready With a thank you ♪ ♪ And that's as much As I could pay ♪ ♪ Why don't you help ♪ ♪ Help somebody Back to health again ♪ There were spans of space where there weren't any stores where we can actually get water. We come across this 20-mile stretch of nothing. And we knew it was coming, but we hadn't prepared for it. 20 miles of nothing? Dude, we're fucked. There was one Vitamin Water left in the cart and it was Tony's and I was extremely thirsty and Tony's like... Did you just chug the fucking whole thing? I chugged it, which was probably a stupid idea. There's no one gonna give us water. I thought that we were just gonna be thrown out and say, "Hey, you're thirsty?" "There's a lot of other people thirsty, go fuck off." Like too bad. All right, let's find out how Bufu, Indiana reacts to us asking for some water because we have nothing right now, nothing. So, walking down this farmhouse road, the first thing that I noticed is that the driveway is extremely long. Doesn't this shit look far as hell? Yeah, oh my God. So, this farm house, it was like at least half a mile to a quarter mile to the actual house. And then as we're walking, it's about two to three minutes up and we're still continuing on. I really like... I feel really uncomfortable, like, walk... Like, I really feel like they're gonna fucking be pissed or something like that. They have flowers. So, like, I'm sure they're gonna be chill, you know. Oh my God! Oh my God. Help, help, help, help! Help, Arthur. Help! Oh my God. So much for the water. Oh fuck, fuck Indiana. Holy shit. Holy shit. Holy shit. - Holy fucking a... - I thought I was dead. - Dude, that was a big dog. - Oh man, my arm's gone. Maybe in Arthur's mind, he thought I knew like how to run. And maybe he didn't know like, "Oh dude, this dude sucks at running." Tony is like... The camera is fucking dead. What? Just once, and I'm fucking... my pants are falling down. That 20-mile stretch of nothing proved that water's important and you gotta have water at all times. I think maybe we can make it to Warsaw. But in Warsaw, we're gonna have to take like, a two-day break because our muscles need like a little bit of time to relax if we wanna make more mileage. Right now, we're in bumblefuck, about 12 miles outside of Plymouth. So, hopefully we'll be all right. Let's do it. What the hell is that cop on? We had a little bit of a snafu with the cops. We have to take a detour from 30? Yeah. Those lights make a left and then a right. And he told us basically, that we have to go down, take a left, all this stuff. That we have to go down and take an alternate route through all this crazy crap because we can't... Look at the words he's using, "You should not." That's not... that's not... there is a law saying you can't do it, that's different. Saying "should not," that's a technicality. Unless it's a law in the county, in which case he's just worded it wrong. It's like, it's gonna rain, we got like $3,000 cameras, if this shit fucks up, game over, man. Cause that looks like a funnel cloud. Yeah, no, that right there, coming towards us? Yeah, let's... let's hurry this up. Yo, let's go. - We have to hitch a ride. - Yeah. Well, go ahead. We need to get out of here. Who are we asking? Them, I guess. - To give us a ride? - Yeah. We were wondering, like, it's cool if you guys say no, but do you think maybe you guys can give us a ride to the motel? Like... Sure. - You could? - Sure. Like if we put our stuff in the truck? We got enough room in the truck, dad? - Yeah. - We should be... Hey, hey you got that knife? Cause I gotta cut this shit. I think I might have thrown it in the bag. That looks nasty. Get a knife. - Do you have a knife? - I don't. - You can put the camera away. - The last time checked... - Give me that, give me that. Just come on. - No more fucking around, dude. The thing I'm worried about, I don't think we're gonna die, I think that we're gonna lose our equipment. Like the first day it was so beautiful, sun shining everything, and then these past three nights... I'm gonna go try to find my... Freaking rain. All of this was just rain we lost this, all of yesterday because of it. The bike problem is so frustrating. I got mine off. It's off. Yeah, tornado watch. - Yeah, we're good. - Let's go. Scoot over. Somebody can fit in the front, and I'll take the front. I'll take the front. Central, Indiana. North Eastern Pulaski County in Northwest Indiana. Do not wait to see or hear the tornado. For your protection go to a lower floor of the building. No, it touched the ground. The main reason we stayed in a hotel was comfort. Yeah, it was expensive, but it was a sure thing. What room are we? Okay there we go. All these people are so well-dressed. Let's go back to the room. Nothing to see here, nothing to see. We put our smelly clothes in like a bag, to seclude them from the good clothes that we did have. And, you know, we make it to this hotel and they got a washer, and dryer, and everything. But you gotta put quarters in. I put my quarter in, I pushed the button and... And right here, I put the quarter in and it won't come out. You know? Excuse me. It's stuck. - The what? - The laundry. Where? This one right here. This one. Like I pushed it in. All right, I don't know what to do with that. I put the quarters in, and now this won't come out. I can't do nothing about it. How much did you put in? - Huh? - How much did you put in? A dollar. I don't care about the dollar, I just wanna wash my clothes. Well I can't do nothing about it. We probably spent a good hour trying to pull the quarter out. And everyone tried their hands on it. It was kinda like the sword in the stone. Dude, now we can't do laundry, man. I don't wanna be stuck with smelly clothes for another week. We still needed our clothes to be clean, because we're not gonna smell like crap for the next week. So, we did the only thing that we could do. That's how you gotta do it, is like this. - You got to scrub it. - No man, you got to go like this. Temperature today, in the 90's in Pembroke, Illinois, Eastward toward the... the Carolinas. That zero that you're seeing by the Carolinas is about Raleigh-Durham where that one represents about 101 degrees reading. Triple digit figures are gonna be found because of the down sloping winds. With those down sloping winds, you get compressional heating and with that the heat even builds greater and greater. Well, it's not only hot, it's deadly hot. The death toll keeps rising as the heat wave continues to scorch the United States with no sign of relief anytime soon. Humidity of at least 90%, zero wind dusts will only make things worse, forecasters say, with temperatures climbing beyond comfort levels and into deadly triple digits. If you need to go outside, do so sparingly. It's gonna be hell out there. The hottest day. We've gotta get out of this fucking weather. Yeah. We are four miles West of Warsaw. We'll be seeing Warsaw today. It's around 5 o'clock almost, so we gotta hurry up cause I wanna fucking, go rest. Warsaw was actually the first main stop on the trip, and it was an opportunity for us to like relax, recuperate. Get our mind off the road and just kinda enjoy ourselves on the trip. Cause we also wanted to have fun you know. Go! Unless you go to Fort Wayne, there's not much civilization out here. And like I said, I'm from Chicago myself, so this is like hell. He passed out outside. Who passes outside, man. Mike? Yeah, we need to get that checked. We're taking you to the hospital. Holy shit. It looks like bruised. I've never seen anything like that. It freaked me out, because quite honestly, I spend a lot of my time indoors. To me, I thought that it would be the end of the trip. I'm Jessica. I'm one of the nurses. Here, you can put this on over your t-shirt, but then I need you to slip your drawers off. - All right, will do. - Okay. Slip that on, right? Alright. So, zero to ten, how badly does it hurt? I'm tapping it, and it doesn't feel anything, like... - You don't have any sensation? - No. And this one hurts, though, you said... This one, this one, if I touch it, well, this doesn't have any sensation either. The only place it really has sensation is right here, and some of, not even, yeah, no. Cause I also put aloe vera on it, just recently, so that might be soothing the pain a little bit, too. But yeah, other than that I'm not feeling, like, any pain. Okay. Let's see, oh my God. I don't want you being in the sun with that, that's really... it looks really bad. You have a thermal burn, and so you're gonna do a dressing daily for about three days, and that's gonna take you off the road for that time, okay? Okay. At the time, thermal burns were kinda devastating. I just don't wanna go home. I don't wanna ditch out or... I wasn't really happy, as a person. I wasn't happy with myself, and what kept me going was the idea that I could be a different person. If I worked really hard, or if I biked harder, or if I made it, that I could change my life. And so, that's what kept me going on. I've got thermal burns and I'm disobeying the doctor's orders, Shred America. I could see James transforming into something greater. He not only had something to prove to the team, but he also had something to prove, I think to himself. That he could do this trip. That as long as he was still breathing that he would keep fighting. No bicycles or motorcycles allowed. This is bullshit. This is America. When we first got into Ohio, we rode in on Route 30 and shortly after that, the cops kept stopping us and stopping us... How you doing? And harassing us. Just got a call that there's kids out on bikes and skateboards and stuff out on the road. - Yeah, officer. - - I need to stop and check on you. It turns out, some truckers aren't very happy about our little road trip here and they don't like us skating near the road, on the shoulder and they've been trying to cause some trouble for us. But there's so many rocks on the shoulder and it's hard to cruise through it and sometimes, you gotta go out onto the streets, or else you're gonna waste so much energy and, like, you need all the energy you can like salvage. This section's illegal here, once you got past 57 there, it's illegal, because it's... Well, that... that... Yeah, those are open-access roadways. Once you get here, it's a closed access road, so it's illegal. How come four guys cannot ride from one place to another whenever they wanna ride? Like, it's crazy. You gotta stay off the major roadways. And this action by the police, it actually threw us on the back roads for the first time. Now, we are gonna go use the washroom, and find out if anyone here in the beautiful town of Lima, Ohio, will give us a place to stay. Hopefully, I'll meet someone in the washroom and they'll be like, "Yo, man. I'll let you stay in my place, yo." Hope someone comes in here and if I ask them if I can stay and they should say yes. So, I go into this department store and I see a guy in the bathroom and he's about to take a dump. I know that you've gotta use the washroom now, but really quick, me and my buddies were skateboarding across the U.S. and we need a place to crash. Do you think you know anyone that would let us crash at their place for tonight? Especially, since it's like a college town? We don't need like... we don't need like... We could sleep on the floor, it doesn't matter. We have two bikes we have to take care of, put them somewhere, but that's it. Do you have like any buddies? Just for a night? Man, I don't know because we're moving off tonight. We're moving our stuff out of our place tonight. - If you want, we could like exchange numbers. - All right, cool. - Three four zero. - Three four zero. Two seven. I think we're gonna find a place to stay tonight. I wear real skimpy underwear in the summer. You're on your own, dude. In the beginning of the trip, Arthur and I always told everybody we'd be couch surfing, staying in people's backyards and the beginning of the trip we weren't doing that. Around Lima was when we started feeling good to ask somebody. No man, thanks for letting us stay in your dorm. It's cool with me. I didn't fear much for my safety. They were very even tempered, very cool guys, but I was very surprised by the culture though cause I didn't expect it. Oh, man. Why would you try that, bro? So, I was sitting there, high off of chewing tobacco. Never again. The Lima boys hold a very special place in my heart, mainly because they gave us a place to party. And it's not the kind of partying that you would like think of back home, it was more like a hangout session with cigarettes. Just going crazy, right there, baby. I thought the Lima kids were pretty cool. I mean, they definitely were like country boys compared to us, and they had their ways. Somebody's going to stop me Saturday. I would punch Gary straight in his face. The only thing on my mind when we stopped was basically food, and sleep and I was tired and exhausted and so I closed my eyes, and fell asleep. Hey, Steven, take his shirt off. I thought you were going ahead. What do you wanna do to him? This is too funny. Oh, yeah. Oh my God. It's awesome, bro. Right on your... That's like a really good flower, who's the art major here? What the fuck? Dave drew the flower. Steve drew your unfortunate sun. And then he kissed your neck. That's cool, I guess. We're friends. Woke up with a chub, I wondered why. This is probably like the best night we've had throughout the whole fucking trip. Touché. We're all gonna wake up and something bad happens to us. All right, today we're gonna be going all the way to Columbus, Ohio. It's about 60 miles from where we are right now. And we're gonna do that today. Get into James's aunt's house and spend two days there and partying and having a good time in Columbus. Hopefully we won't have any tornadoes. No. It's turning, like, blue. What do you mean turning like blue? It's turning blue, why? - Just here. - There's water inside there, or what? Yeah, I think it's Gatorade. It's got electrolytes in there. Don't pop all of them though. She said you get sick if you pop all of them. That's the reason we stopped. Why can't anything just, fucking, stay right? Taking off my bandages. Oh my God! It was taped to my burn. And it's looking pretty good. Looks good. It's fucking up, dude. Even in six now. At least the tires fixed, now our only little problem is the gears on the bike. We gotta walk this thing to Columbus, Ohio, and possibly get new bikes. This is not good. This is holding us back. We've been having more bike issues than skateboard issues, which is kinda surprising. Shred America. Mike and I, we came to the decision that these old bikes, they were too much trouble. And it just so happened that James' uncle, Sean, he lived in Columbus. Now we're gonna load the stuff up. Yeah, we'll load the stuff up. Family being family, they cared a lot. This is the best I could do on directions, but you know. - Okay, cool. - So, you... I think they were a little bit intrigued by the prospect of hosting such an interesting project. I guess leave the camera bags here and I'll bring an extra tape. The bikes that Mike and Arthur had given us, you could tell that they were used. It's all broke. Probably have to take this one in, this could take a little while. We didn't have problems with the skateboards, we had problems with the bikes. And I sort of just wanted the problem to go away and the quickest way to resolve that problem was to buy new bikes. If I put it on seven, like, I'll seriously, like, destroy the road. Knowing that the mountains were coming up and we were gonna hit steep glades, Sean bought us helmets. And he was also nice enough to make his house our home base so that we can prep for the hills ahead. Columbus was a great opportunity for us to relax, recuperate, we had to take care of the media and our equipment. All right, let's go, pack up. I think we over packed for the trip, we had too much stuff in the carts and just too many things that we really didn't need. Whatever was excess weight, whatever was extra weight, whatever we deemed unnecessary, we tossed it. So, the most important thing at that point was preparation for the mountains because we didn't know what to expect. It sucks man because the shoes are just really, really messed up, so. I only brought one pair of shoes, Mike only brought one pair of shoes. We figured that's all we would need, but we didn't really expect that we would be braking with our feet, so. It's just a bunch of hill bombs. Even putting your foot down and kind of creating that friction, even that sometimes won't stop you if the hill's too steep. Not only that, but the hills keep getting bigger and bigger. So, we're dealing with that right now, but there's just more and more hills to come, so it's just something we gotta deal with, you know? You gotta go? All right man, yeah, I'll talk to you later. Peace, later. - I would not hill bomb on that. - - Maybe I would. - I would never. - You wouldn't hill bomb going down? No fucking way, no. Look how fucking big that is. Oh my god, holy shit. You gotta be kidding me, man. That's kinda funny, how you were like, look at that... Not only do we have to climb, we're gonna have to bomb that on the other side, - then there's gonna be more... - You guys should probably brake, going down. If you don't trust your skateboard, you are gonna fall and a small, little jerk in your board happens, you're just gonna start going out of control and just fall. Woooh! - You're gonna go on 153? - Yeah. You're gonna get into some more hills. Yeah, is there any way around that, yeah? We should write this down, maybe. Ah-ha. So, it's not on here. Well, there it is, right through here, - Yeah. - You're gonna have some pretty good ones. And right after that? After that, you're in pretty good shape. Pretty good shape? Nice. Not bad, we could handle a couple of hills, we handled them this far, you know? Well, yeah. So, hopefully we'll be all right. Fuck! It was a pretty steep hill bomb, and I remember holding onto James' cart cause I knew it wouldn't go so well with me. Arthur felt like a daredevil and he rode it down. We heard a scream in the distance from Arthur and then when he approached us he was just bloody. I wasn't expecting to fall, I was going really fast and I got speed wobbles and I ate it. I felt the wobbles coming on at first, and I decided just I could push through them, and I couldn't. I went run, run, run, roll. And I just rolled maybe, like, five or six times. Yeah, I just moved. That was pretty scary for me. I'm lucky that I didn't get hit by a car, or didn't hit my head or anything like that. I knew that if Arthur was injured, if things went poorly... Doctor Lagen. That it would really be game over. You gotta clean it. You gotta clean it, I don't want infections. All right, there's that. Now, let's clean up your hands. Yeah, I'm just gonna do it. And I actually see how this looks, ah! There's so many cuts. God damn. Oh God! This hurts so much. I got so lucky, man. - This is going to hurt. All right? - Cool. Let's carry on guys, let's carry on. That's the point when I realized that, if the injury were any worse, then it could have stopped me from completing the trip. I want to continue on. And I want to grab onto one of your carts when we're going down a steep hill. That was really not cool. After I fell, I was so beat down. I was so tired. I didn't wanna go anywhere. And this guy pulls up in a pickup truck, rolls his window down, looks at us and he says, "Hey guys, my name is John." He's like, you're not gonna be able to make it in the dark. I'll see you guys three miles up. By the time that we got to his house, they had all the food just set up. They had hot dogs and refreshments for us, and the guy took us in like we were his own kids. - Thank you so much for the food. - You're welcome. It's like a buffet right here. It's awesome. There's plates under here. It's so good. You guys have come way south of Chicago, believe it or not. I was trying to figure out why you came so far south of Chicago. It's cause we wanted to go to Columbus. - You wanted to see Columbus? - Yeah. Yeah, I was kind of curious about that. We we're looking for the easiest way. So, there's not the most massive hills. You're not gonna get across Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania is hills. Yeah. So, you guys have to head out of Chicago, I thought you would stay up here on 80, take some back roads along 80, cause 80 goes right into New York City. - There's Interstate 80. - Yeah, yeah. But you dropped way south, see you dropped this far south. Wanna bust out and make it as far as we can before dark time? Well it's really, I mean it's your call. He said there's a lot of truckers that go by. And semi's aren't cool. - Not at all. - At least to get hit by. We're gonna be walking the whole thing. Like hill bombing it's gonna be... I got a little fire picked out behind the house if you guys wanna camp there tonight. You guys feel like camping? - I'm down for whatever. - That would be nice. It'll be a nice safe place for you to spend the night. Get up in the morning, you'll be fresh. Trek it yeah. It would be daylight, wouldn't have to worry about these semis hitting you. Yeah. Come on, I'll show you. Okay. No one wanted to get up and leave, and you know, we all decided to stay and I think that was the right choice. Screw that, I'm sleeping in the tent. It's straight, dude. - I'll take some. - Sure. Here you go, Mike. Wouldn't it be cool if we came across a watermelon field? That is Mike and Arthur, excellent adventure. That's Mike, I'm Arthur, we're skateboarding. Oh, handsome, yeah. Yeah. We're in a bunch of newspapers, and the media's covering this whole trip. Front page, Daily Herald today, front page... I did not expect to get this big. They're like "Please, do us first." Photographer's gonna come and shoot some pics of us. We're gonna have an interview with CNN. We wanna do Good Morning America first. Oh, my God. We wanna get you on the show when you come back to Chicago. I've found a couple guys you need to know. Hey, what's going on, buddy? Hey, how are you? Buddy, I'm doing well! I wanna talk about this skateboard adventure. Oh yeah, sure. They would just be on the phone a lot more, because they wanted to secure us for a, you know, a TV slot time, or an interview. When the New York Post article came out... hat's the New York Post from a couple of days ago. If you have time to stop by a store or something like that, check out he New York Post, on page 15. Hat's the New York Post from a couple of days ago. That's Mike, that's me. - That's pretty amazing. - That's the New York Post. - That's a great deal. - It was just featuring Mike and Arthur. Well, I guess you're famous then, right? Yeah, we're famous. Even though it's about all four of us. And I remember going to the gas station and like picking up the paper and reading the article, you know, big smiles on mine and Arthur's face, and then James and Tony are looking for their name in the article and they can't find it. I felt like I was putting an equal effort to the rest of the guys. And so was Tony, and we weren't being recognized for it. When James and Tony became upset over not being in his big New York Post article, Mike and I just had to make sure to tell the media from then on out that they were an important part of the trip. They were an integral part of the trip, and that their names needed to be included in future articles. - Nothing? - Yeah, pizza place. It's open. The lobby is open until 10. - While we're out of Ohio in like five steps. - Oh, really? Where at? We're just jumping around the place we're in. We did like over 450 miles. And we've got another 400 to go, so fucking cool, man. As we went through Ohio and West Virginia, and finally got to Pennsylvania, the one thing I noticed is that, we felt stronger as a team. This is pretty bad because he's a spooner too. Here we go, he's a spooner. Get the fuck outta here. It was so important for us to just keep going, keep getting to the states and having these new experiences, because it brought us together closer as a team. And at the end of the day, that's what it's all about. Man, like all the good parts are ruined. Why don't you fucking take a dump? It's not that, it's like the side of anus hurt for some reason. That's probably why you were complaining yesterday about the fucking hound dog. - It's prairie dog. - Prairie dog. What do I do? Fucking cream, ass cream. Damn. Yeah, you just need, rash, it's probably a rash. All right bitches, we got five hours of sunlight, let's roll from this biatch. Where are we, Tony? I don't even know. Pennsylvania on mountains. Going up and down, it's pretty fun. It's all about peace, man, American freedom, baby. Yeah, angry people beeping, we get that a lot in here. The Appalachian Mountains, they were a series of hills. Each hill leads to a bigger hill, and a bigger hill, and a bigger hill, and by some point, you realize, you're in a mountain chain. That's where we were yesterday. God damn. These giant Behemoths, they were just everywhere. How big they were, blew me away. This was the part where we're hitting the heart of the Appalachians, the Alleghenies and the tough part of our trip. I'm fucking so tired, dude. My whole body's sore, man. It's only been three weeks, and it feels like fucking three years. Oh man. But that's how it is dude, you never like really think about shit until it's already ended. Yeah. I was very annoyed with the mountains, because it was a constant struggle with them. We had to walk up the mountains because we couldn't skate up them. And we had to push the carts up the mountain, because they were too heavy. Pushing the carts was like pushing a box. There were the... the wheels didn't help. It was just pushing weight. We had the assistance of Mike or Arthur helping us push the bike, and the bike cart up. It was a drawback. You'd look at it and go, damn, we have to do another hill? I was going up the mountain. How was it? Nice, tough hill, it's a tough hill. And the locals, almost every single time, they would tell us that there was an even bigger hill up ahead. So how high are we right now? So, there's a bigger hill, fuck. Because that was a pretty big hill. And this kind of shit went on for days. Ten miles away and it's all uphill. Yeah, so at least we can break our 30 for the day. Yeah, right. Cause we did like just ten yesterday. As long as there's not like uphill. Oh yeah. My legs are fucking shot. We just walked up a three-mile hill. Mount Pleasant, Pennsylvania. And I have to tell you, it was probably just as bad as you think it would be. Three mile uphill at an elevation maybe 3,000 feet, maybe 2,000 feet. And it's 8 o'clock. Really? There they are. Yo guys, we should probably camp. It's getting dark. Is there a car coming? Yeah, okay. 25 miles today. A few massive hills. We're gonna come off the road here and make camp. Hopefully, we'll have a safe place to stay, start a little bit of fire, and if any storms pass through, the trees will give us a little bit of shelter from the weather. Hopefully, we'll be all right. They said that there isn't anything for another 26-miles, that one guy said that we met. Dude, we're in the motherfucking woods, dude. We're in the woods, man. Yeah, we're in bear home. I can't wait to get back to civilization to sleep in a fucking bed, man. Oh my God! I've never been camping in my life before this, dude, never. Camping, man. We can't make a fire there though. Why? Cause like embers and shit, and all that is dry wood. Where? Everywhere, look at that shit right there. Let's all get some rocks and make a really good pit. But embers fly up. Yeah, let's do it really quick before it gets dark. And there's not really a lot of trees here. I don't know. It doesn't matter, I guess. I just think we better do it by the canopy. Okay. Well yeah, we can leave this here. Once we were in the mountains, and we did something that we called wild camping. You didn't necessarily feel safe because you didn't really know what was out there. Oh nice, and it's flat ground here too. Yeah, we'll probably put it there actually. I'm like, "Yeah, mom, we're gonna put all of the food and put it on the trees." Bears can climb trees. Oh, yeah. Yeah, but that's the point, so that it's the distraction, and we get away. No, it's like it's supposed to hang from a branch, but we'll put it in a tree, and if they wanna take it, then let them take it. That's some hardcore shit. No, there's a few rocks right here. No, I know. We'll find some. Why? Yeah, dude, but if you start a fire, then you won't get bit up. This is fucking crazy. Put that in the fire because a bear's gonna smell it. On Man versus Wild it said... - You burn everything? - You're supposed to burn it, yeah. Like when he eats animals and shit, he burns the rest. All right guys, I'm going to bed. All right. - Peace out. - See you later Tony. I'll see you guys. It's only 10:40. Yeah, I'm getting to bed as well. Here's the rest of the peanut butter. Just sit man. Nah dude, I'm chill. Yeah, you're chill. - I wanna just sleep. - Aw, man, I think I burned my skin. - Hm? - Nothing. Here, take it off with a knife. All right, Tony, no more fire. Okay. No more wood in the fire. All right, good night, dude. All right, what are we burning here? Shit, guys, it's fucking raining inside the tent. Get everything in the middle. Tony, wake up. My fucking sleeping bag's all wet. The camera... I don't care about anything else, put everything in the middle. Everything's inside the tent? I don't think so. - Tony, get the... - Fuck, fuck! It's so, ah... That's why I fucking hate camping, man. Oh, fucking water all over the tent. We survived the night even though it was like, fuck, don't flood. That was some good rain though. Ah, god dammit, what the fuck? Oh, dude. Ah, what? Ember fucking felt like it, burned the shit out of me. It just stuck to my foot and it was just like, "Ah." And it wouldn't come off, you know? It's 9 o'clock exactly. Four more miles, we'll get there by like... 10:30. Probably ten. It was always difficult to sort of estimate the time needed to travel from one point to the next. And most of the time, our estimates were always off. I wonder how far we are. We're probably still like 20 miles, right? Yeah. My thoughts on night riding was it was the stupidest thing we did. The only real positive thing about night riding was that you're out of the heat, but, I mean, besides that, there were a lot of negatives. What do you think, right there? And then it reflects off his helmet. You didn't see anything besides the person next to you, and then when we'd get to towns, they were just like ghost towns. There was nobody out there. Where are you? Stay right there. Never had anything like this before, dude. James supposedly, he said he saw it and it's fucking, it's just... - Sprained. - It's just gone. It might be a cramp cause cramps... It's a hardcore pain, dude, like... Cause cramps sometimes can kill. This is talking about like a razor blade slitting my fucking back open, and then ripping out tendons. Like, I mean, usually I can take pain, you know, skateboarding. This fucking hurts dude. Like I wouldn't have just screamed out in pain over that. When we get back man, cold, we're gonna get an ice pack and put it on your shoulder, that'll help. You want some... There was like small injuries riding at night. Like I remember I fell and then hurt my knee, and Tony like popped his shoulder when he was riding, so he fucking had enough of it too, at night. Making mileage is great, but... Fucking it's 8 o'clock so you stop, you know what I mean? Right, cause it's... Keep going, cause ten more fucking miles because... The only reason why you ate shit was cause you couldn't see in front of you. Cause you can't see in front of you going downhill, what the fuck are we gonna see going uphill or, even worse, when it gets steeper. The whole team had been hurt in some way, and I guess this was just my turn to like feel the wrath of Shred America. Let's chill for, like, ten minutes, and then we'll go. - All right. - Yeah. Do some stretching, fucking... All right. Whatever you need to. I mean, it's five miles, we could fucking do it. We've got it, yeah. You take one of the skateboards... Oh, that hurt, dude. Okay, let's giddy-up. All right, we're gonna walk this bitch then. I jumped on a skateboard and I started skating, and they kinda took the load off of me and we got closer to our destination and our goal. Oh, my God! I know I'm waking you up, probably, you're sleeping, right? Okay, I was in the washroom and I've kinda been feeling this pain in my butt. I starting butt pain like three days ago, and then after that. No not two years ago, three days ago. Yeah, yeah, oh it hurts all the time. But then I kinda looked into the mirror and I touch the area surrounding my anus, and it's kinda swollen. You think I have like... like a virus on my anus? I mean, I'm not that nervous about it, I'm just kind of weird that my... it's swollen. It's a swollen anus. Well, everyone else didn't get a swollen anus. It's disgusting. What do you mean? Yeah, I can go to the bathroom. Well, yeah, it's not closed up. I don't have like pink eye. It's like a good like one fourth inch popped out. It's so swollen. It's not... it's not like, a hemorrhoid cause a hemorrhoid is like a butt pimple. It's just like, a swollen anus. I don't know. All right, I'll be in touch. Bye. Wanna take a look? - No. - - So, it's not an ass rash? - No. - No, it's seriously. You should have put cream on it. - Put that cream on it. - I don't know. - Let me see it. - Wanna see it? - Sure. - You want me to spread my cheeks? Yeah. To make sure you're okay and you don't fucking... That's bad man, why wouldn't you just... Can you hold a light up to the anus? And I'll just prod it. And don't prod it. Here you go Dr. Lagen. It's swollen, dude. It's like it's hairy down there. It's really hairy down there. - Okay, do it. - Look at it. Oh, my... - Oh, what is that? - What the fuck, dude? We stayed overnight in Breezewood and we walk out the hotel room and we see this big mountain. The biggest mountain I've ever seen. It was like the Shaquille O'Neal or Andre the Giant of mountains. If we can get to Chambersburg, great. If not, anywhere, 10, 15 miles would be awesome. I couldn't get you to Chambersburg. I wouldn't have time. I mean you're hoping somebody has a trailer? We're hoping someone has a truck, like someone with a pick up. Good luck! In the end, we just had to face it. There was no getting around it, besides us doing it ourselves. We were not getting any assistance on this. Appalachian Mountains, baby. Appalachian Mountains. I wouldn't do that if I were you, bro. You're gonna be shitting for a week. It's good. Better than some of the water in Ohio. Yeah, it tastes good. You wanna try some? No. We're all, like, gonna puke after this. - Did you shit? - Yeah. We're like right here. I mean we're almost right there. To me, I thought the mountains would never end. And it was sort of like mountains, mountains, and then all of the sudden, Philadelphia. Oh my God! Dude, he backside 3'd into that. Tony was super enthused about Love Park. And I remember him just being like, "Go, Love Park. Yeah." Oh, it's like the video. Oh my God! Dude. Oh my God! Simply put, Love Park is the skateboard Mecca of the United States. Like, to come across something that you've seen in skate videos, played in skate video games, to be at that place, and even rolling up to it I started getting goose bumps, and then I got to skate it, so that was also really cool. Like just to be on a board, it's just a dream for any skateboarder to be at that place. You okay? Cause you totally. You all right? Soon after it became this skateboard Mecca, it was stripped away. This is the Philadelphia police. Leave the area immediately, leave the area immediately, get out of here, skateboarders. Mayor Street thought it was something that had to be stopped. And he spent one million dollars of public money to destroy the use of Love Park by the skateboarders. No other subcultures religiously go to Love Park more than skateboarders. And I think skateboarders, that's the reason it has even gotten as much recognition worldwide as it has is through skateboarding. Still to this day, it's illegal to skateboard in Love Park. And that's really difficult for a lot of skateboarders to grasp. It's such a historical place. It was an honor to be there. Because we were so close, I mean, Philadelphia was so close to New York City, we were like right there. We wanted to go. That's the taste of New York only being 40 miles away. Tastes delicious. Hey how's it going? Did you get a hold of Mike? Let me just fill you in really quick. We left really early yesterday, we got into this like old-school, hole-in-the-wall motel off the side of the road. This is sweet. Look in here... Made sure to go to bed early. Watched a little bit of inspirational television. We woke up early and we just started high-tailing it, you know? We've been high-tailing it all day. Yeah, I tell you, these New Jersey streets, they suck. And they suck so much, I mean, we're trying to like ride through these rocks and they're just all over the road. And even with these big wheels, it's like, "Ah," you know. Just trying to push through it. But I'll tell you this, we're so close, and since this morning all the guys were just like, "We just wanna get there. We just wanna get there." And like the one, like, cherry on top is that we're scheduled to be on a bunch of like news networks, right? Like we're doing Good Morning America, The New York Post is actually coming out today. They're gonna be taking, like, pictures of the last few miles. I mean there's no turning back, you know? It's kind of mind blowing that it's even happening. I don't think any of us were expecting this. But yeah, I mean, that's pretty much it. So, we're all just so excited. Okay, sweet, we can't wait. Thank you so much, bye-bye. All right, great. Thank you so much, appreciate it. Bye. We're gonna be on Oprah Radio. They're really going to do that? , no, Oprah Radio in New York. Is she Oprah, with actual Oprah? No, no, with Gayle. It's like Oprah owns the radio station and it's like Oprah Magazine. Oh. I heard Tony's gonna be the front cover of Oprah Magazine. The phone calls, they fueled us, they captivated us. Every time the phone rang, it was like, who's it gonna be this time, you know? The end was in sight. We were all jazzed up and we're all ready to go. I did not care how much I hurt. And I just wanted to get there, like we were that close, you could taste it, like, you're in New Jersey. We were all so excited to be done. We're skateboarding down Route 1 and Route 1 is supposed to take us straight into New York City and that was like the easiest way to get in. But it turned out to be this complex maze of like speeding cars and like no shoulder. I felt so uncomfortable that I came off the road and I started just walking. And Mike runs up to me. James almost got hit by a car. I wasn't afraid of the mountains. I wasn't afraid of the heat, or the burns, or any of that stuff. I was afraid of Route 1. The only way to get to New York is the one that is like allowed for bikes and skateboard or whatever is on Route 1, right? Is there any way to get a police escort into New... You know at least like... cause I don't see any other way and this is probably the most dangerous road I've been on the entire trip, you know. Like, we're gonna be on CNN, Good Morning America, and all of that when we get there. We just don't feel like dying before, I mean, we're so close, you know what I mean? What do you mean shut it down? We just want to get into well, we're trying to get ultimately to New York. I mean I know exactly it's not that far, but... I can't allow you to be on Route 1 at all. - At all? - At all. - Are you serious? - Yeah, it's illegal to go on a state highway with bicycles that are, bicycles or skateboards. - You can't ride on a state highway. - Oh yeah? Yeah, we've been told that plenty of times. - Good luck, I hope you make it out all right. - Thank you. - Take care, good luck. - I'm glad you came out, thanks. Fuck! Every route that we need to take, or that would take us into New York is like north of us, right over here. Well, yeah. Which is why all the bike routes that we saw, we were like, "Man, why does it go so far out of the way, goes north and then south?" Why? Well, actually, now we know why. We're waiting on the side of the road, and we'd know to be expecting the New York Post photographer. Hello? - How's it going, man? - How's it going? Listen, I shoot for the New York Post. They wanna get a picture in of you guys like before anything goes on. - Yeah. - This way it holds the page for you. - Yeah. - So where are you guys, all over there? We're still right there because we just got kicked off 1. Okay. The police said we can't be on 1, we can't be on any highway at all. Well, let me get a quick shot just for prosperity. All right? I'll be right back. This sucks. Just stand right over there, brother. Okay, here's what I want you to do. Hold up, you guys are the main guys or it's also the... These guys are too. Okay. Okay, guys, looking at me. One, two. All right, so here's what we'll do. Let me give the desk a call, let them know that I got something. Can I get off over here? And meet you at the parking lot, right here? - Yeah, yeah. - Okay. Slowly and surely, the dream of making it to New York City, of skateboarding across that bridge, was starting to fade away. Like I said, here's what I can do. Obviously, I can't put it in that, but you know, I can get both of you guys up there if they can get a ride too. Maybe I can pull half the load, you know what I mean? We sort of put all this focus on the media and the media attention that we lost focus of what really the trip was about. If we could find one ride, if you can find a ride for these guys first, then yeah. It was either all of us r none of us. That's at least what I believed. Okay, one adult. Shred America. Attention, Metuchen customers, the next train to stop on track one will be east bound train to Penn Station, New York. Stopping at Metro Park, Rahway, Linden, Elizabeth, Newark International... I'm nervous. - Yeah, me too, I got butterflies in my stomach. - Yeah? New York, Penn Station, last stop, folks have a good night. We made it to New York! We made it. - We're fucking here! - Alright. Mike, get your hand in. Shred America! New York Times! - Where? - Right here. This is like, it's just a fucking train ride man. Dude, pick it up, man. Come on, let's go! New York! We're fucking here, we did it. Wow, this is the place to be, dude, holy shit. I love New York. I love New York. This place is awesome. At the end of the day, the media got what they wanted. We got what we wanted. And, you know, you can't change anything about that. Whatever happened, happened, you can't change it. And all you can do is just appreciate it. Bro, wake up dude. It's time to party, get up. We got to move it! We got to do 50 miles. Fucking 50 miles today, man. We're going into Canada. You serious? It's not even a funny joke. You guys are good, I love you guys. All right. Oh, shit! You guys pulled a 100 pounds of equipment, what kind of stuff did you have with you? We had a bunch of, we had tents, camping equipment, everything we needed to basically survive for a little while if we needed to. Roads were nice, occasionally the drivers were not. They drive very fast. What was the most rewarding part of this experience for you? Just seeing Time Square, just getting in that night, and just seeing the lights. What, did you cross across the George Washington or something like that? No, actually we had issues with the cops, they didn't let us on the highway or on the bridges. So, we actually had to take a train down into the city. Oh, you did? Okay.
