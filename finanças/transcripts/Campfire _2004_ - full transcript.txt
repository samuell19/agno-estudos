Tammy, open the door. Tell them Dad's not home. They're here to buy the car. They don't need to know I'm a widow. Tell them your father's not home, but your Mom is. It 's okay, go on. - Esty can go. - I won't be part of this. Hi, we're here about the Peugeot. - My father's not home. - When is he due back? I don't know. It 's about the car? I'll get the keys. My husband just stepped out. - We don't want to disturb. - I'll bring the papers. We work nearby. We'll come back when your husband's at home. Have a nice day. See you. My father died of cancer a year ago... two weeks before Lag B'Omer. Iwas 15 at the time. The yearof mourning ended, and Mom decided to sell Dad's car. It's been sltting in the same spot since Dad last parked It there. Since these are hard times forthe people of Israel, Mom also decided... to join the founding group of a new settlement in the West Bank. But first she has to pass Motke Kupfer's acceptance commlttee. This is Motke. He likes to have his picture taken wlth important people. Mom always says that Motke is important in Religious Zionism. But I think my father didn't like him much. Shula, his wife, is a good friend of my mother's... and Ya'ir, theiryoungest son, is in my youth group. Even the Ministerof Interior came to his Bar Mltzva. Okay, tell us what you do. I'm a construction engineer. I work for a building company. - I'm an insurance agent. - I'm a lawyer in a Tel-Aviv office. - I'm a special-ed teacher. - English teacher for 5th graders. Tell him what you do in the army. In reserve duty, I'm a battalion commander. I think that these days we should all take... the initiative and strengthen these settlements. We feel that this is the need of the hour. And quality of life for the kids. We couldn't afford that in the city. It 's really important to us to have a house with a lawn. - We couldn't afford it in the city. - But that 's not the main reason. If you were on the committee, what kind of people would you pick? People like us, I think. People like us. Mainly people like us. People like you. You know, establishing a settlement isn't just having meetings. It 's also hard physical work. Are you sure you can handle it? - Alone? - I'm not alone. I won't lie to you. The number of trailers we have is limited. And if you move into one of them, it means one less man for guard duty. One less for the prayer quorum. It 's something I need to consider. I can't complete the quorum, but I can do guard duty. I see no problem here. Okay, Rachel. Let us think about it and get back to you. Keep up the good work. I'd just like to tell you that... being a part of this settlement is very important to me. You don't need another guard. You need someone who believes in the cause. Someone strong enough to withstand the difficulties... and I have that strength more than most of the people you know here. This is my dream. His name is Yossi Moraly. The sweetest man, a bachelor. If it 's okay, I'll give him your number. He'll call you. Say yes. What 's there to lose? I've been planning this for a year now. - It 'll help them see you're serious. - I'm very serious. That 's why I said what I did early. I just hope they understood me. So you agree? Can I give him your number? All right. What did you say his name was? Yossi. Yossi Moraly. Why do you have to beg them? If they want you, they'll say so. If they don't... ...there's nothing for you there. - lf they don't want us? They don't. Didn't you see how they treated us? As though we were lepers. Anyway I'm not moving to that place. There's nothing there for me. So where do you intend to live? I'm renting out the apartment. If you rent it, I'll live on the street and become a prostitute. You'll have one daughter a settler and another daughter a hooker. Will you drag me by force? I don't want to live in that settlement. And I decided that, at all costs, no matterwhat... this year I'll be happy. - Ignore them. - Tammy Gerlick! What 's up? Tammy Gerlick, what 's up? Got your period today? Do you know them? - They're in my youth group. - Tammy Gerlick! - Can I help you? - You can behave like a human being. What 's that? Go on, turn around! Why'd you stop? Watch your mouth! You don't know who you're dealing with! You're right, absolutely right. We're sorry. In my time, we didn't have people like that in Bnei Akiva. He's cute. Hello. Just a moment, I'm not sure. I'll see. Dad, it 's for you! About the car! Dad? Mom, is Dad home? It 's about the car. Dad! Would you stop that already? It 's not funny anymore. Hello. - Hello. I'm Yossi. - Rachel. Nice to meet you. - Are you hungry? I haven't eaten. - Very hungry. Here. Sit here. Everything okay? Everything okay? - I can turn on the heating. - No, thanks, I'm fine. - How do you know? - I can... - Sorry. - Go ahead. What were you saying? No, I just wanted to ask how you know Motke and Shula. Motke and I were in yeshiva together. And I knew Shula even before that. She's been trying to marry me off for twenty years now. Electriclty flows from your hands Love me gently Love wlth your hands Slowly, desperately Cheek, neck, shoulder Love me wlth your hands Slowly, desperately I'll have the sweet and sour chicken, please. Same for me. You can try something different. I can put it in the middle. You can share. She says you could order something else and she put it in the middle. No, no. Chicken is fine. Let her bring chicken. Excellent. But she should bring us bread, for the blessing. I don't think they have bread in a Chinese restaurant. No, we haven't. Do you want appetizer? Maybe... we have egg-roll. Chopped. Very good. Egg-roll, bring egg-rolls. Egg-rolls are good. She should bring egg-rolls. I've tried them, they're delicious. Okay, fine. Thank you. - Nice place, isn't it? - Yes. Did we disturb you? No. - Well, what do you think? - About what? Think you'll want to see me again? It 's okay, you can say no. I know we're not right for each other. But I enjoyed tonight anyway. I enjoyed meeting you. Really. Thank you. Am I your first date since your husband died? So how was it? Okay? I think so. I don't know. You tell me. I've been on much worse dates. - Worse than this? - Believe me. Once I was fixed up with a woman, on a blind date, just like this... and when I came to pick her up, we'd already been fixed up. - What, you didn't remember her name? - No. There are so many names. How many dates are we talking about? How many women did you meet? Hundreds. But I stopped all that. In the last two years, I stopped saying yes. - Why? - It wasn't working. I felt bad. I felt people had given up on me. Truth is, I pretty much gave up on myself. - And tonight? - You know Shula. She's really pushy. I thought she'd already given up on me. Then she came up with this idea. So I felt awkward. I agreed. And that 's it. Okay, I'll take you home. MINIYOSSI BUS SERVICE The best of luck to you, Rachel. Just don't despair, everything will be okay, I'm telling you. And if you ever need a ride anywhere, call me. - Okay, thanks. - Good night. Good night. Esty? Esty, be careful not to walk barefoot here now. What? What are you doing? No one locks doors in my house. You want privacy? Get married. - Be careful not to walk barefoot. - Are you out of your mind? You're a total psycho! What 's wrong with you? You should be committed. I swear, I'll call the police! - Tammy, bring me the garbage can. - Does this seem normal to you? Why are you helping this madwoman? Think I care? I'll show you privacy. Help! There's a crazy woman here! Someone call the police! Help! If you don't come inside, I'll smash your guitar. If you touch my guitar, I'll take off my clothes for everyone to see! We'll see what they think of that at the acceptance committee. Hello. My Dad's in army reserve duty. Call back in a month. We've decided to accept you to the group. But for a trial period. I'm very sorry, Rachel, but you have to understand. A settlement is like a delicate plant. A tiny plant. Too much wind, too much rain, and the plant dies. So before I put it in the ground, I have to make sure... it 's strong, that all the elements are at their best. Let me get this straight. Am I in, or not? Before we move to the site, we'll have a vote. Are there any other people on a trial period? No. Don't worry, I'm sure they'll accept you in the end. Don't worry. Did you talk to Yossi? I understand you're not interested. Still, I wanted to thank you. I'm glad I did it. I'm glad too. Remember, this is a 2nd marriage. Don't expect any fireworks. You have to get it into you head that you're looking for... I don't know, a good friend who'll keep you company. He doesn't need to be a knight in armor. He needs to be a''mensch''. Look, I have someone else for you... but I don't want to bother him for nothing. Maybe you're not ready yet. - I'm ready. - Moshe Weinstock. He's divorced. He was an army cantor. He's a very impressive, very wealthy man. - Do you know him? - No. But I think Shmuel once went to see him sing at a concert. - So are you interested? - I think so. I... Good. I'll talk to him. But, Rachel, I have to know that you're serious. He's not someone to play games with. He's no MiniYossi. Okay. I get it. It stings a little, but don't worry. You have to keep it on for ten minutes. Careful you don't eat it. - You do that all your life? - Soon you'll start growing a beard. But don't get upset. It 's well-known that hairy women are smarter. I'd rather be stupid, but not have a beard. At least you got Dad's coloring. Imagine what it 's like to have a mustache like mine and Mom's. Know why Dad died quickly? The doctors said some people... live for years with his illness. He knew Mom didn't have the patience to take care of him. Tammy! Tammy, come to eat. I know you don't like to hear Zionist talk. But still, there are just a few clean words. We're setting out on a mission in orderto save Israelis. Just because they're Israelis. And Jews. And if we don't do It, no one else will do It for us. This is a long and complicated operation... Blessed be the True Judge! Yoni is dead. Yoni is dead. Goslan, you nut! Don't you dare show your face here again! - Rachel? - Yes. Moshe? Moshe. Moshe Weinstock. Hello. Nice to meet you. - I hope you didn't wait long. - No, no, no. Nice hotel, no? I like it a lot. Exclusive. But not too fancy-shmancy. They have a cake here. A cheesecake. Unbelievable. I'm not just saying that. It 's world-class. You have to taste it. - Do you come here often? - You might say they know me here. - Shula tells me you're a cantor. - Cantor... I just lead the prayers once in a while. No need to exaggerate. This is my favorite part. It 's my father's melody. Come on, what are you afraid of? I'm not getting into trouble with your mother? - There's no one here. - Are you out of your mind? I'm not going into that room. Think I'm crazy? - What 's the matter? Come on. - Come downstairs. I don't want to go downstairs. Who cares about the door? Stop it, Esty. I'm not kidding. I'm leaving. Okay then, leave. Don't be crazy. We can't be here. Your mother's due back any minute. Okay. No one's forcing you to stay here. Go. I swear, you're even crazier than your mother. - Are you nuts, blowing up bullets? - But what a cool explosion! He'll kick you out. What 's the matter, Tammy Gerlick? Too snotty to say hi? What, we don't exist? If you'd say hi, I'd answer you. Okay, but why did you stop? Keep going. Get lost. Hey, you moron! Forget about him, Tammy. He's a psycho. You can stay. - Why is she staring at us? - Why are you chasing her away? - I feel like it. - Great. It 's okay. I have to go anyway. Tammy Gerlick, is it true that you put out? Tammy Gerlick! Tammy Gerlick! Stop it. Shut up already. Wait a minute, Tammy. Hi. I just wanted to tell you not to be offended by what happened. That Goslan guy is insane. It 's okay. But thanks. - Who's the soldier who was with you? - Who, llan? Yaniv's brother. He doesn't have any friend at his age, he just hangs out with us. I hope that 's not yours. Actually, it is. It 's okay, you can sit. No one's touched it for a year. I bet the battery's dead. - You know about cars? - A little. Why? Nothing. The battery's dead. Not just the battery. Is this weird for you? Why didn't you want us to visit you while you were mourning? - Who said I didn't want you to? - That 's what they said. Ya'ir and Ayala would come to Center, huddle-up in a corner... and then they'd choose the delegation to comfort you. Whoever wasn't chosen would stay at the meeting with all the geeks. - So you stayed with the geeks? - The geeks and the lowlifes. But then I went home. When Ya'ir and Ayala and you aren't there, there's no point in staying. - Don't you know that? - That 's funny. I'm always sure that wherever I am is where it 's the least interesting. Shame you didn't come to comfort us, you'd see I was right. They said your family didn't want too many people coming. Actually, I wanted you to come. I have to go. See you at the bonfire? - I may not go to the bonfire. - Why not? I think we'll have our own bonfire. All the geeks and lowlifes. - Shame. My birthday's on Lag B'Omer. - What, right on the day? According to the Gregorian calendar, it 's the day before. A day before doesn't count. Bye. - Did you call for a ride? - Thank you. The world is like Noah's Ark. If you're not in a couple, you're left out. - What 's so bad about that? - Maybe it 's easier for men. I want you to know, I look at you and think how lucky you are. You have two daughters, a nice apartment, a community. That 's a lot. And you're still young and beautiful. I probably won't have children. I have some friends. You're never had a serious relationship with a woman? All those women you met? - But I'm attracted to women. - No, I just didn't understand. But I've never had sexual relations with a woman. When I was at the Yeshiva, I said, ''I'll wait till I'm married''. And it didn't happen. I didn't mean to embarrass you. It 's not something that comes up. It 's okay. Really. Are your parents alive? - Brothers? Sisters? - I have three sisters. They're all grandmothers by now. So you're in touch with your nephews? When they were kids, I was the cool uncle. The one who brought presents. In few years everything changed. They've busy with their own lives. Everyone's busy. What do you do on Shabbat? Sleep. Well, I think I'll be going. It 's late. - Good night, Yossi. - Good night, Rachel. If you ever need a ride anywhere, call me. Sure. - Good night. - Good night. - Happy Birthday, Tammy. - Thanks. You're welcome. It 's your birthday. And I think it 's a great opportunity for us to sit down and talk. Since Dad died, I may not have done enough... to find out what you're going through, but I'd like to change it. I want to hear everything you have to say, really I do. Tell me everything that 's on your mind. Let it all out. Tammy, do you want to start? Esty can start. In the last year, you've completely lost it. That thing with the door, what was that about? The whole settlement thing, Dad would never move there. I'm sure he wouldn't have sucked up to them like you do. If that committee told you to run around naked, you'd do it. That 's what 's on my mind. Tammy? I know you're having a hard time, Mom... but sometimes I feel... you try so hard to show the world we're okay... that you overlook the fact that we have feelings too. We can't lead our lives according to what Shula and Motke decree. Of course. Of course. I'll take that into consideration. I just want you to know that you are the most precious thing to me... and that your lack of consideration and cooperation... I feel that you do it to spite me, that you blame me for Dad's death. You're young, you don't understand and I hope you never will... but understand this: we're living under a magnifying glass. I want you to know that if we're not accepted into the settlement... I'll be left here without one single set of friends. What you're doing is simply spitting in my face. If you want to be left without a mother too... ...this is the way to achieve it. - I don't need this. Happy birthday, Tammy. - So you came? - No... but I brought you a birthday present. - Thank you. - Do this with your hand. HAPPY BIRTHDAY. RAFI Thank you. Well, I'm off. They're waiting for me at the bonfire. Bye. Bye. Rejoice, praise the holy word Shimon Peres is a stinking turd Rejoice, praise the holy word Shimon Peres is a stinking turd Sanctify your life Wlth the Torah And purify It through the labor The frult of your labor Will make you happy! The frult of your labor Will make you happy! Well? I hear from Moshe that it was a big success. - That 's what he told you? - He hinted that it 'd lead somewhere. But he wouldn't tell me. Tell me. It 's a real experience to him? - I'm surprised that 's he told you. - See? Soon we won't know where you are, you'll be globe-trotting with him! How long do you think he can mess with that piece of wood? His entire life. - Want to go to Rafi's bonfire? - Now? - We'll say hi to him and come back. - I don't know. No one here's giving us the time of day anyway. No. Forget it. I don't feel like it. Okay. I'm going. Cute girl, take off your shirt And if you're sweaty, your bra An angel from Heaven Will come and kiss your breasts Let 's go back. Suddenly I don't feel like going. Go back? We're there already. Let 's at least say hi. Okay, but if I want to go, you're coming with me. I'm not going back alone. Tammy, the whore Opened the store Everyone's standing in line Wlth a huge hard-on Inbal, the whore Opened the store Everyone's standing in line Wlth a huge hard-on Rocks and bridges A black asphalt road Evening falls Slowly A sea breeze blows The first star shines Over belt-Machsir Bab-el-Wad, forever Rememberour names Convoys broke through In theirway To the clty Anyway, he pays her... she comes over and undresses him, he does and comes... she gets dressed, so he says to her: ''Just a minute. This was a regular fuck, what was Spanish about it? '' So she says: ''You're right, I forgot. Ole! '' - You morons, you don't get jokes. - No, that was funny. Great joke. Here's another. The same rabbit walks in the forest... Wait, wait a minute. Enough of your rabbit. Maybe the girls have a joke. Give them a chance. Go on, relax a bit. Got a joke? Tell us. I'll laugh for sure. - Here, I'm already laughing. - Okay, I have a joke. - I don't believe it. - Not very funny, but never mind. A guy decides to give his wife a jacuzzi for her birthday. She's happy, gives him a kiss. They both undress and get into the jacuzzi, splash around in the water. Suddenly, the doorbell rings. So the wife gets out, puts on her robe and goes to see who it is. When she opens the door, it 's the upstairs neighbor, Mr. Cohen. He looks at her and says: ''I didn't know you were so pretty. I'll give you... 1OO dollars if you open your robe more at the neck. Just a little. Half an inch.'' So she opens her robe a little at the neck. Mr. Cohen looks and gives her 1OO dollars. Wow, this is such a stupid joke... You can't stop in the middle of a joke. It 's the rule. Okay. So Mr. Cohen looks at her legs and says: ''lf you open the robe a little on the bottom... I'll give you 1OO dollars. Open it just a tiny bit.'' What about the husband? He didn't notice that she's opening her robe? - Shut up! - Don't you know this joke? Everyone came. It was a success, wasn't it? It 's always a success. Pity we didn't invite Moshe Weinstock tonight. Well, he's not in the founding group. But maybe Rachel will persuade him to join us. - It was really successful tonight. - It was, wasn't it? - Good night. - I'm glad you came. - See you tomorrow at the march. - Yes, sure. - Good night. - Good night. Yossi? Did I wake you? It 's Rachel. Hello. I thought you might want... to come to the march with me tomorrow. - I didn't know girls who had jokes. - You'd be surprised. You're crazy. Girls are twice as horny as guys. Am I right? If I knew what it 's like for guys, I'd tell you. I can't believe you're even answering him. Okay, I'm cold. I want to go back. I have a jacket in the car. Want it? - You sure? - You coming? Stay a bit longer. Don't go. Till the fire goes out, then we'll walk you back. Okay? If you like, you can sit in the car and warm up. - Come to the side for a moment. - What? Why leave? Till the fire goes out, then we'll go. I promise. Okay, I'll be in the car. Shirt hanging out, shoelaces untied. Didn't know where I came from. Like I'm a reserve guy, he says: ''Soldier, over there! '' So immediately I start to limp. Sorry. Do you mind if I put my hand there? - I think the fire's going out, no? - Wait, sweetie, where're you going? - I think I'd better go. - Yaniv... go get the Jerrycan, do me a favor. Wait a minute, what 's the rush? - Leave me alone, I want to go. - Okay... we said till the fire goes out. - Pour. We'll see if it 's gone out. - Let go of her, llan. Pour it! What? Just a kiss, what 's the big deal? You okay? Just say if you're okay or not. I don't want you to start screaming. You okay? - I want to leave. - No problem. Anyone stopping you? What about the others? They don't deserve a goodnight kiss? What about Goslan? He doesn't deserve one? And my brother doesn't deserve one? Come on, let 's see what you can do. I'm holding her. Do what you want. - Leave her. You'll get into trouble. - She agrees. Why are you upright? You agree, don't you? What did she come here for? Here, see? She agrees. What do you think? That 's how women are. First they say no, but then they enjoy it. Do you think she doesn't want it? Sure she does. She just won't say she wants it. It feels good, right? See? It 's not so bad. Can't you see she's crying? Come on, let her go, Goslan! Let her go! What are you yelling about? Are you her father? We're just playing around. Here. I'm letting her go. If she touches my dick, I'll let her go. I swear. Just touch it for a second, and I'll let you go. What do you care? No force, just a little touch. That 's all. Convince her to say yes, and I'll let her go. What 's the big deal? Here, I'll give you ten shekels too. Come on, Tammy. I'll let you go right after, I swear. Just a tiny touch, and you get to keep the money. Don't play hard to get. And then you swear you'll let her go? I swear. I swear by my mother. Do you agree? Tammy! Tammy! Tammy! Tammy! Tammy! Tammy! Tammy! Tammy! Tammy! Tammy! What 's the matter, Rafi? Are you okay? Look, I'm sorry I hit you earlier. I just wanted to tell you something. It 's better to fuck some bimbo than to be a snitch. I hope you understand that. - You're Tammy, right? - Yes. I'm Yossi. I know. Your mother asked me to drive her to the march. I'm waiting for her. - Shall I get her? - No. We're supposed to meet in 1O min. I don't want her to be pressured. - Were you at the bonfire all night? - Yeah. What a fun. How I miss those days! - I hope you had a good time. - What? Ayala and Ya'ir got home two hours ago. - Can you tell where you've been? - With Inbal. What 's that smell? Did you sit inside the bonfire? By the way, your ride is here. - How was yesterday? - It was nice. Pity you didn't come. I thought only the founding groups was invited. Maybe we shouldn't go to the march. - Really? - Yes. - So where do you want to go? - I don't know. Maybe somewhere with less people. I know a place. GERLICK Hello there. Hi. - Is Tammy home? - Yes. Want to come in? I'll get her. - What 's your name? - Rafi. Just a second, Rafi. Tammy? Tammy. I don't know. She won't answer me. - Do you come back this afternoon? - No, it 's okay. Thanks. Bye. - Do you miss your husband? - The girls miss him. And you? I miss having a man in the house. But my marriage wasn't very good. I married so young... So why did you stay with him? I don't know. He was good to me. What 's with all the questions? - Sorry. - No, it 's okay. You can ask. I don't mind. What do you want to know? Did he know you didn't love him? I think so. More questions. I have one more, but I'm afraid of your answer. Ask away. Worst case, I won't answer. Is there any chance of you sleeping with a man you're not married to? - You're very direct. - Sorry. I shouldn't have asked it. And if I asked you the same question? I've decided I would. - Where's Tammy? - In her room. Tammy. Tammy, did you lock the door? Shall I bring the hammer? - Tammy, open the door. - She's in there since this morning. Tammy, are you all right? What do you mean, since this morning? I mean this morning. Which part don't you get? Tammy, why did you lock the door? You know we don't lock doors here. I'm sorry. What 's this? Don't you want to change? Take a shower? I'm tired. Tomorrow, okay, Mom? Someone named Moshe Weinstock called. Twice. Said to tell you he's coming to that scouting trip of yours tomorrow. - So what did you tell him? - I didn't spoil it for you. And the sons And the sons And the sons Returned to their homeland And the sons And the sons And the sons Returned to their homeland And the sons And the sons And the sons Returned to their homeland Where the hell are we? Motke, couldn't you settle somewhere closer to the city? What, Ramallah isn't a city? - Why did you leave? - You can't hear with that wind. Get used to it. Do you know that the wind is like here at night? There are rumors going around about what happened at Rafi's bonfire. - What are you talking about? - Rumors. I just wanted to say, I don't blame you or anything. And if you want to talk about it... you can talk to me. I just think that... if we're going to live together in this settlement, we should talk. - What did you hear? What rumors? - All kinds of things. Tell me. I want to know what you heard. Don't you know? No. That you put out. That I put out? But I told you, I don't blame you. It 's natural. Ya'ir, what are you doing? - Are you crazy? What are you doing? - I thought you wanted to. - Idiot. - What happened? Hi. It 's not right. Why didn't they say there'd be cows here? So beautiful. Tammy, go in. I'm coming. Good night. Sorry, I didn't plan for Moshe to be there. I couldn't hurt his feelings. I know. It 's okay. Though Weinstock doesn't seem the type to take offense easily. You've noticed. He invited me to come to his concert. - Are you going? - I don't know. I told him I'd have to see if I can make it. It 's really funny, you know. Shmuel, my husband, wanted to be a cantor. He loved cantorial. And he had a good voice. But he was too shy to sing in front of people. I really hated it. He'd try to drag me to all these concerts. We'd fight, and finally he'd go alone. Go to the concert. I hear he's pretty good. - I have to go. - Okay. - lf you need a ride somewhere... - I call you. I know you're waiting for someone better than me. I can even understand it. I just want you to know that I love you. I think you're a very special woman. It 's okay. You don't have to answer me. - Good night. - Good night. I'm not waiting for someone better than you. Don't ever say that. You're the nicest person I've ever met. So what are you waiting for? I don't know. I'm waiting to fall in love. I'm 42 years old, and I've never been in love. Shula says... I shouldn't wait for fireworks, but that 's exactly what I'm waiting for. You're so self-centered, you don't even hear what you're saying. Good night, Rachel. - What 's that? - Holy shit! TAMMY GERLICK'S A WHORE My mother will die. Each candidate commits himself in writing to be able to pay the taxes. Wait. I don't think it 's my job to check other people's bank accounts. No, but they can sign a statement that they're able to pay the taxes. That 's what the committee is for, right? But it means that, from the onset, people without money can't join. I want to get this straight. Is that the message we want to send out? It 's not about a message. It 's about reasonable administration. We're about to start a settlement with very low living expenses. A trailer or a mobile home hardly costs anything. If you want to control the quality of your neighbors... you have to make sure they're not here just because it 's cheaper. But our goal is not just to settle the land, but to unite the people. So let the National Committee add a clause about uniting the people. I'm not moving to the middle of nowhere to live in a slum. That 's the whole idea. An ideological settlement. Simple. And you should be the first to know what I'm talking about, Rachel. Could you tell me what 's that supposed to mean? Take a walk around the neighborhood. It 's all over the walls. Remember, these are the worst years. From now on, things will get better. How many years, exactly, until the worst part is over? Two years, three at the most. Just take a deep breath and hold your nose till high school's over. Then go do your National Service as far away from here as possible. Not like me. If Dad hadn't died, I'd go serve in Eilat... or even in Egypt. How I hated it when he smoked. I miss him so much. I know. Me too. Whenever I think of him, I remember how Mom'd drive him crazy. Poor guy. Want to tell me what happened at the bonfire? Esty. Esty, wake up. - What do you want? - I need your help. When are you coming back today? - Are you talking to me? - Yes, I want us to buy you sandals. - I don't have time today. - So find time. - Would you talk to me? - I'm late. Never mind. Be late. I want to talk to you. I'm not angry. I just want to know what happened at the bonfire. Tammy, if you don't tell me, I won't be able to help you. If someone hurt you, I have to know about it. - Mom, I beg you, don't do anything. - That 's exactly what hurts me. You didn't come to me when it happened. Am I your enemy? It 's good to know what hurts you. I don't need your help. Why are you taking that tone with me? You don't need my help? Are you trying to punish me again? My life isn't hard enough? I need to hear that my daughter's a whore? Do you have any idea where I spent the night? I went around erasing graffiti from the walls. Thank you very much for your help. I want to know where all the counselors were when it happened. How's it possible that I send a15-year-old, innocent child... to a bonfire and she ends up spending the night with hoodlums? I won't keep quiet about this. I'm telling you, no one will get away from this. I promise you. Hello. My Dad died. If you want to buy our car, you have to talk to my mother. Good luck. We know who they are and it 's being taken care of. Believe me, it is. This isn't the first time we've had trouble with them. So what are they doing at Bnei Akiva? Why didn't they? It 's not that simple, Rachel. They didn't come to the Center. Your daughter came to them. We can't control everything that goes on outside the Center. But what am I supposed to do? It could happen to another girl. The fact is, it didn't happen to another girl. Motke, I'm going to the police. And you'll be sorry for the rest of your life. You really want some cop to start questioning all of Tammy's friends? You don't know what really happened there, either. You don't let out things like this. Believe me, it 'll make the papers and the whole world will talk... about the slut from Bnei Akiva who seduce the boys in her group. She didn't seduce them! She's not a slut. She didn't seduce them. That 's not what I said. I said that is what they'll say if it comes out. So what am I supposed to do? Nothing. It 'll blow over, Rachel. I promise you. Look from Heaven Look from Heaven Look from Heaven And perceive That we have become an object Of scorn and derision Of scorn and derision Among the nations Yossi? It 's Rachel. I need a ride. Urgently. I don't know... - Are you okay? - No. - I'm sorry. I'm a horrible person. - No, you're not. I hurt everyone around me. Shmuel, my girl, now you. - Something's wrong with me. - Not true. Remember what you said that night, under my house? - I'm trying to forget. - Don't forget. I want you to love me. But I already love you. I'm going to wake them. You know Yossi, don't you? Esty, you haven't met Yossi. Yossi, Esty. Esty, Yossi. I have two very important things I want to discuss. First... I want to know what you think of the new settlement. Before Motke calls his vote, I want us to have our own vote. Who's against moving to the new settlement? Okay. Now, Tammy... I want to talk to you alone, in your room. I just want to know that you're all right, that nobody hurt you. If you don't want to tell me, you don't have to. You can tell someone else... the school counselor, a psychologist. You can write it down on a piece of paper if you're embarrassed. But it 's not good to keep silent. Silence is what I want now, Mom. I'm okay. I believe you. I trust you. I'm okay. Don't worry. Are you leaving? I have to work this morning. - Don't you want to drink something? - No, thanks. I'm late. Thanks. Need a ride to school? Hang on, I'll bring my bag. - Why did you run away this morning? - You ran away too, didn't you? What do you mean? Do you usually go to school at six-twenty in the morning? So you don't have to work? My mother will be offended. - You think? - She likes to take offense. So maybe it 's better not to tell her I didn't have to work this morning. Why... didn't you ever get married? - I guess something's wrong with me. - I'm serious. So am I. God doesn't want certain people to marry, so they won't reproduce. So He spoils something in their personality. Something little, that you don't notice at first. But that something makes them stay alone. That doesn't make sense to me. I know some couples. I can't believe God wants them to reproduce. So you think you'll never marry? Chances are, no. My mother will be sad to wake up and find you gone. - You think? - I think so. So we don't see you anymore? Hello. Come in. - In the living room. A drink? - No, thank you. - Shall I bring you coffee and cake? - No, thank you. - How's Tammy? Everything alright? - Tammy's fine. I'm glad to hear it. It 's terrible what 's happening at the Center. Some kids in Tammy's group come from very problematic families. You wouldn't believe the stories I hear from Ya'ir. But things will probably be much easier in the settlement. You're in. We had a vote yesterday, and I insisted you'd be in. That 's it. What, did I surprise you? Now the real thing begins. There's lots of work. Before we start with the real thing, I came to tell you... that I don't want to join the settlement. I'm giving up my place. - What do you mean? - I don't want to be there. I don't understand. I'm in shock. Do you realize how hard Motke worked to get you in? It was your dream. Can you tell me what happened? Well, I'm sure you'll find a good family to replace us. Well... - I'm shocked. Simply shocked. - Stop being shocked with everything. Don't talk to me like that! Well, I think I'll be on my way. I wish you the best of luck. If you don't want a reputation for being picky, return Moshe's calls. It 's not very considerate towards us either. How picky can I be if I've been your friend for all those years? How ungrateful! - Hi. - Hi. - How did you know where I live? - You're on the contact list. - Rafi, you coming? - Just a minute. I'll be right there. I feel so shitty about what happened at the bonfire. Why did you come over there, anyway? For you. So, we'll be seeing you? - Do you want to see me? - Yes. And I decided that at all costs, no matterwhat... this year I'll be happy. Start it! C APTIONS BY VIDEOLAR
