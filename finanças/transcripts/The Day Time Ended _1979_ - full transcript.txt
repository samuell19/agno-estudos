(wind howling) (bats screeching) (eerie music) (foreboding music) - [Man] Hello? Can you hear me? Can anyone hear me? I don't know where I am. I don't know where I am anymore. I don't know what century I'm in. There is a message I must get through to anyone who can hear me. When I was out among you, I always believed, as you did, that time exists in a sequential pattern, one day following another, one year after another, each century following the previous one. But it's not like that at all. I can tell you that now because I know it. Believe me. You see, time exists in a continuum. I've found words spoken thousands of years ago are still around somewhere in the vast infinity of space. The future, as we call it, that too is with us now. Past, present, and future are constantly in conflict in a finite world. On a planet known as Earth, which I once inhabited, we think of time as something that is happening now, that the past is gone, that the future is not yet. But that's not so. If anyone can hear me, know that yesterday, today, and tomorrow are constantly with us and will be with us through all eternity. (mysterious music) (lights booming) (insects chirping) (suspenseful music) (whirring lights warbling) (mysterious music) - It sure will be good to see the family again. - Yeah. I'll bet Jenny has grown at least a foot in the last three months. - (laughs) They must have had one hell of a vacation. - Well, if you're gonna build a house, you've gotta get your family out of the way. - Tell me about it. - Across the country observed a most extraordinary event at 5:23 this morning. - Hey, get a load of that. - A trinary supernova, a simultaneous explosion of three giant stars located in the center of the- - Hey, we better get a move on if we want to reach that plane on time. - Clearly visible in the early morning sky. Scientists tell us that the actual event occurred several hundred years ago and that the light and now the radiation from the explosion are just now reaching our planet. Radio telescopes around the world are studying the skies today in hopes of learning more about this highly unusual occurrence. Meanwhile, authorities tell us that the levels of radiation reaching us from the supernova are extremely small and pose no immediate health hazard. However, news services around the world are reporting electrical disturbances and radio interference. And here in the deserts of Southern California, we've even had some reports of ground tremors. We remind you that there is currently no cause for alarm. Scientists say they have no reason to expect any further repercussions from those extraterrestrial exposures. - (laughing) Hello! - Oh, wonderful. Come on over here, baby. Hey! I'm glad to see you. - We had a ball. - Come here. Come here, baby. - Hi, Mom. - Hi. It's nice to be home, though. - Come on. Let's get you out of here, huh? - [Richard] Honey, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to drop you at the new house and run, and I mean run. - Oh, no. - I have these plans I have to get out in one hell of a rush. I have to be in New York within 24 hours. - Daddy! - Don't worry, sweetheart. I'll be back late tonight. - Daddy, we were on a camel! - (laughs) Oh, Jenny! - A camel, huh? - You should have seen her! - [Grant] That must've been a lotta fun huh? My, my. (light string music) - Oh! - Well, there it is, finished product. - Oh, Grant. - What do you think of it, Beth? - Oh, Daddy, you did a great job. (laughing) It's fabulous! - That husband of yours is the best goddamn draftsman west of the Mississippi. Damn good with his hands too. It's all solar powered. Everything is modern as you can get. - Yeah. Even I like it. - You're a tough little kid to please. Wait till you see the surprise I got for you. - Me too? - Yeah, you too, baby. - Follow me. Come on, sweetheart. (light wind instrument music) Now you wait right there, Jenny. You too, Steve. Close your eyes, both of you. Now, don't you open them until I tell you, okay? - I bet it's a puppy dog. - It's better than that. - Keep 'em closed. Don't you open them yet. Now you can open them. - A pony! - Wow! I'm going to try him out right now. Thanks, Dad. - No. Better put him up, son. We have to unpack the car. You can ride him later. There's plenty of time. - Thank you, Grandpa! - You can play with him now, honey, but don't leave the corral. Isn't he pretty? - What do you think of them, Momma? - Oh, beautiful choices. - Let's split, huh? (pony neighing) (mysterious string music) - Look, see? Look. Like her? Huh? Look. Is this a cute baby? Is it cute? - You'd better hit the road. Don't worry about this stuff. Steve and I will take care of this. - Okay. Thanks, Dad. - Take care, Steve. - Bye. - Sorry, honey. There's no way out of it. Jenny! Come say goodbye to daddy. - I know. I understand. Will you call me? - As soon as I get in. - Hey, come back. You wait here. I'll be back. (pony neighing) (eerie music) (statue chittering) Did you see my new pony? I want my new pony. Please help me find my pony. (statue chiming) - Jenny! - Thank you. Bye, Daddy! - Goodbye, sugar. You be a good girl for Mommy now, okay? - I will, Daddy. - All right. I'll see you tomorrow. Mm! I'll hurry back. (engine igniting) - Hey, Momma, let me help you with that. (soft suspenseful music) - What happened? - My god. I have no idea. - Oh, man. Looks like some bikers came in. - Bikers? - Yeah. Before we went on vacation, I saw some guys hill climbing. - Everything's all right in there. (horse neighing) - Jenny! - Better check upstairs, Steve. (wind howling) (eerie music) - Grandpa! Grandpa! - Not now, sweetheart. Not now. - Grandpa, what's that funny thing out behind the barn? - I don't know. I don't know. - Grandpa. - Not now. - It makes funny noises. - Well, everything's all right in the kitchen. Seems to me they only hit one room, this one. Damn hoodlums. - I don't know why they did it, or who did it. But you'd better call the police. - Jenny, honey, what are you talking about makes funny noises? - Lots of lights and stuff, and it plays music. - Sweetheart, there's nothing out there behind the barn except the corral. - Hey, Dad. Everything looks fine upstairs. They must have heard somebody or something and left. - Dad, maybe we'd better go check. - Yeah. Let's go. Atta girl. Let's go. - (sighs) Well, don't just stand there. Help me clean up. (horse neighing) - I'll show you just what I mean. - Okay, sweetheart. (eerie music) (horse snorts) - Granddad, it was there a little while ago. It really was. - Oh? - All right, baby. Let's go in the house and clean up that mess, okay? - But Mommy, it was. I promise it was. - Hey, it was lights and stuff? - Yes, Granddad. - And music playing? - Yes. - Come on, Jenny. (solemn music) (artifact chiming) Jenny, I won't tell you again. - I'm coming, Mommy. (upbeat groovy music) - God, that's not good. Does this look good to you? - Yeah. - (laughs) You better run in and wash up, sweetheart. Dinner is just about ready. - Okay, Grandpa. - Did you call the police? - Yeah, I called them. They said they'd be over in the morning to make a full report. They also said to leave everything just like it is. (mirror crackling) (eerie music) - Thank you, water. Thank you, light. Is that good, Grandpa? - That's good, good. Come on. Let's go eat, huh? You sit right there on the end, okay? There you are. - Grandpa, this is a funny house. - Oh? - How do you mean, Jenny? - It's the only house that I've ever seen that works by itself. - What are you talking about? - Well, I walked in the bathroom, and the lights went on. And I went to the sink, and the water turned itself on. - I think you're crazy. - Yeah. - Fed the horses, huh? - Sure did. - Good boy. - Fed yours too, you little monster. - It's nice to have a man around the house. (all laugh) - Hey, excuse me, Momma. There you are, Steve. (insects chirping) Listen. - [Ana] I don't hear anything. - You have to listen very, very carefully, sweetheart. - I'm completely tuned in to the silence and turned on by it. Isn't that what you wanted me to say? - No traffic, no sirens, no planes, no people, no nothing. (mysterious music) - There's not a road there, is there? Or is there? - No, that's not the road. - A jet? - It can't be. (objects buzzing) Don't suppose a pair of two motorcycles can shoot right into the air, can they? - No. No, you can't say that. - My god, Ana. We just saw a UFO. - I don't believe it. - Get back inside the house. - Well, how long do you think it'll take to fix it? Yeah. Okay. I'll call back in an hour or so. Thank you. (muffled rock music) - Hey. Why don't you get on to bed? I think I'll have a glass of milk and lock up. - All right. (mysterious music) Grant. - Yes? - Come look at this. - I'll be right with you. What is it? - A mirror. - Well, what about it? - It was broken. - By god, that's right. At least I think it was. - Well, we all saw it. It was broken right down the middle. - What the hell goes on? - Grant. - What? - Someone's in the kitchen. - Oh. - And look, it's green. - I just left there. There couldn't be. - Go see. - It seems to be okay. - You see? It was just that solar-powered thing. - Well, I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll check it out first thing tomorrow. Okay? - All right. (soft string music) Come on up. - I don't know what the hell to do. We just go to bed and try to forget it, huh? Oh, god. Goodnight, sweetheart. - Goodnight. - You know, other people claim they've seen UFOs, but I guess I never did believe them. Give me your hand, darling. (eerie music) (toilet flushes) (curious upbeat music) - You want to play? (ominous music) (UFO buzzing) (artifact chiming) (eerie music) - Grant, it's in the hallway! - What's in the hallway? What could it be? - Dad. - Did you hear anything out here? - I thought I heard Mom yell. - She said she saw something. - Well, let's go check Jenny. She's gone. - What's happening? - Jenny's gone! - No! - My god, what's that? (foreboding music) - Jenny! - What's wrong? - Jenny's missing! - Jenny! - Jenny! - Jenny! Jenny! Oh, my god! - Jenny! Jenny! (ground rumbling) (eerie music) (UFOs whizzing) They're back again, Grant. - What are you talking about, Mother? - Well, we saw them earlier this evening. (door clacking) - Oh, Jenny! - (sighs) My god, I could have shot her. - Baby, where have you been? - I was outside playing with my friend. - [Beth] Your friend? What friend? - That thing that made the bad thing go away. - What bad thing, Jenny? - I thought it was a telescope, but it wasn't. It sort of long and looked like Daddy's rifle. But- - Oh, my god, Grant. Could somebody be out there with a gun? - Could be. - Dad, I think we've got to get out of here till the morning when the police come. - Where can we go at one o'clock? - I don't care. I just want to get out of here. - All right. You two get dressed. I'll take a look around outside. - Be careful, Grant. - I will. You stay here. (insects chirping) (suspenseful music) (horses neighing) (stall banging) (horses neighing) (suspenseful music) (horse snickering) - [Reporter On Radio] We interrupt this program with an update from the US Weather Bureau. Those electrical disturbances throughout the deserts of Southern- - Yeah, hello, operator. I'm having trouble reaching 343-4077. Can you check that line for me, please? - [Reporter on Radio] And some communities are reporting slight ground tremors. Communication with the stricken areas has become increasingly difficult tonight due to telephone blackouts and atmospheric radio interference. Utility companies are being swamped with requests for assistance, and the Highway Patrol is warning motorists to be on the alert. - Yeah, okay, fine. Thanks. I'll keep trying. - [Reporter on Radio] And downed power lines. Weather Bureau spokesmen blame the freak weather conditions on electromagnetic radiation resulting from that triple supernova which occurred more than 200 years ago and whose effects are just now being felt on Earth. We urge you to stay indoors, remain calm. (insects chirping) - Hey, Steve. Come here a minute, will you? - Yeah, Dad? - We're going back to town. - What about the horses? - They'll be okay. We'll be back in the morning. - Are you sure we even have to go? - Sure do. - It will make Beth feel better. Go see if she and Jenny are ready. - Okay, Mom. - Well, you about ready to go? - Just about. - Mommy, I don't want to go. I like it here. - Shh. Honey, don't talk now. - Beth, you coming? - Yes, coming. (car engine igniting) - Dad, isn't that the car? - Yeah. Honey, you stay here. - Be careful. I don't get this. You just take it easy now, circle over there, and I'll circle around here, okay? - Yeah. All right. - All right. Are we ready? Let's get out of here. - No, no. Something's going on out there. - What do you mean? - Well, the car's running, and nobody's in it. Jenny? Where is Jenny? - Jenny? Jenny? - Stay there! Stay there! All right, Steve. - What is this, Dad? It doesn't make any sense at all. - Well, Jesus Christ. See if you can jerk that battery cable off. I'll give this alternator a go here. - Mommy, isn't this fun? - No, it's not fun, Jenny. It scares me. - It does? Okay, car. I want you to stop fooling around. You're scaring my mommy. (engine shuts off) (eerie music) (ground rumbling) - There it starts. It's starting again. Look! Look! (UFOs whizzing) - Wow! - Everybody get inside. Hurry up! (thunder rumbling) - Hello, operator? Give me 343-4077 again. Thank you. (phone ringing) - Hello? - Hello, hello? Grant? Grant? - Richard? Richard, can you hear me? - Grant. - We need help. Get out here as quick as you can, you hear? - What the... Operator? Listen, all I got was interference. - [Ana] Did he hear you? - (sighs) I don't know. - Well, okay. Forget it! (thunder rumbling) (engine igniting) - Dad, they're gone now. Can't we get out of here? - I think so, Grant, while we've got the chance. - Okay, first thing we're going to have to do is find out if the car will run. - Well, you have the keys? - I left them in the car. - I'll try it. - All right. Let's get the hell out of here. (mysterious music) What is it? - I don't know what it was. (thumping on door) - Mommy, that's the bad thing I told you about. - Everybody upstairs, quick. (foreboding music) (UFO humming) (gunshot booming) (UFO blaring) (ominous music) Get in the bedroom. Quick, quick! (lasers zapping) (artifact chiming) Huh. That's damn strange. It stopped. - I wonder why. - I don't know. It's not even warm, Ana. (thunder rumbling) - [Reporter on Radio] The Highway Patrol has issued an advisory to all motorists in the desert area. - Hey! Anybody here? Hello? I'm in a hurry. I need some gas. - Well, I can't get you no gas, fella. - Well, why not? - I ain't got no power. There's a hell of an electrical storm out there. - That's just about where my family is. I've gotta get some gas. Can't you hook up some kind of siphon or something? - I've gotta have a hand pump someplace around here. - Can you go look for it? - I'll try. - Thank you. (thunder rumbling) - Wait. Where are you going? - I left my dolly downstairs. - Your doll? Well, we'll leave it there, because right now it's better if we all stay here. - But that nasty thing is out there. It'll take my doll. - Well, I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll go downstairs right now and get it for you. - Will you? - Sure. - Better not, Steve. You're not going anyplace. - Dad, we haven't heard a sound for an hour. - I know. We'd better take a look in. Where is it? - It's at the bottom of the stairs. I'll run down and then right back up. - Looks okay. Go ahead. (suspenseful music) (UFOs whizzing) Look at this. - Wow! Look at those lights! (UFOs whizzing) (tense music) - Grant! - Huh? - It's Steven! - Good god! I'm coming, Steve! Shove that dresser in front of the door after I leave. (tense music) (suspenseful music) (UFO humming) (laser beam chiming) (monster roaring) (monsters roaring) - Do you see anything? - Something coming from the side of the house. I'd better go downstairs. Grant will need help. (monsters roaring) - Hey! Get back in the house. Hurry! (monsters roaring) (monster growling) - Dad, the stables. - Yeah. (monster roaring) Let's hurry. Turn on the light. Come on. Come out of here. - You're going into the desert, huh? - Yeah, that's right. - Watch out for those power lines. They're down and all over hill. - Okay. That's about it. - Give me. That's about 12 gallons. At $0.65, that'll be... - That'll be $7.80. Here. Keep the change. - That's right. Hey, thanks a lot. - Thank you. - Well there doesn't seem to be anything out there right now. - Can't you see any sign of Steven or Dad? (knocking on door) - That might be them now. (Ana gasps) (monster roaring) (Ana screaming) (monster roaring) - I better check at the house. You stay put here. - Maybe I better come too. - You watch the horses. We lose them, we'll never get out of here. - Dad! Here, take this just in case. (monster roaring) (foreboding music) (monster roaring) - [Reporter on Radio] Again, a big triple supernova recorded earlier this morning. Already the debate has begun as to whether the event was indeed an explosion of three stars or a totally new, unrecorded stellar phenomena. (monster roaring) (horses neighing) (monster growling) - Quick, Steve. Bring up one of the horses. We've got to divert that son of a bitch. - But Dad- - It's the only way. It's the horse or us. Move! (monster roaring) Get back down there and make all the noise you can. Help divert them. Go ahead. - Hey, you! (monster roaring) Now, Dad! - Hyah! Hah! (tense music) (monster roaring) (horse neighing) (monster roaring) (UFOs whizzing) (wind howling) - [Reporter on Radio] Communications have been cut off for most of the evening. Puzzling information is starting to trickle in from storms... In the wake of severe electrical disturbances and unusual seismic activity. (UFOs humming) (tires squealing) (wind howling) (lights chiming) (ground rumbling) (Ana's speech drowned out by rumbling) (mysterious music) (suspenseful music) - My god! (wind howling) Anybody out there? Hello, hello, hello? (ground rumbling) (wind howling) (lights chiming) (mysterious music) Jenny! Jenny! (statue chiming) Run! Hurry! - Grandpa, wait for me! Grandpa, wait for me! Wait, Grandpa! - Run, Jenny! Run! - Wait, Grandpa! - Come on, Jenny! Run! - Jenny, no! Jenny! Jenny! - Jenny! - No, Jenny! Jenny! (solemn string music) - Easy now, son. Easy now. That's a good boy. There you go. Take it easy. That's it. That's it. What are you doing out here, huh? Where is everybody? You all right? That's a good boy. That's a good boy. (horses neighing) - Are you okay, Son? - Sure, I'm okay. You were going to check up at the house. What's Mom doing here? - Check up at the house? What do you mean? - That's what you said you were going to do just a few seconds ago. And why is it light outside? - Son, I left hours ago. - Hours? Dad, you just left me. You hardly closed the door, and you were right back here. - Steve, you know what this is, don't you? It's a time-space warp. - I'm not sure I know exactly what that is. - I don't suppose anybody really does. We've seen some strange things tonight, strange creatures that we know don't belong on our planet. God only knows where they came from. - Jenny and Beth... - The vortex took them. Just took them away. I don't know what place they're in. I don't even know what time they're in. I don't even know what time we're in. - What are we gonna do about Beth and Jenny? - What are we gonna do about any of us? - We go on. That's what we do. (wind howling) (lights chiming) - Look! (suspenseful music) (wind howling) (lights chiming) (solemn music) - Grant. Grant. Do you know where we're going? (wind howling) (lights chiming) (soft string music) (wind howling) - Momma, Momma, wake up. - Huh? - Look. - Oh, my god. (moving string music) (statue chiming) Oh, Beth. You're all right. Where's Jenny? - Jenny is fine. She's with Richard. - Beth, what is it? - It's all right. Everything's going to be fine. We're going to be safe. I know where to go. I'm not sure I can explain it. It's only a feeling I have. I felt a communication, a series of images, after which I knew what was happening to us. And I knew our fear was unnecessary. - But how can you be sure that they, it, or whatever, is telling the truth? - Oh, I don't think it knew what deception was. It goes beyond those things, millions of years beyond. And yet there is a feeling there of a warmth. These are life forms evolved past anything our imaginations are capable of perceiving now. - What's gonna happen to us now, Beth? - I don't understand it completely, Dad. For a while the whole galaxy was turned upside down. - Are we ever going to see Jenny again? - Oh, yes, of course. She's waiting for us. - Beth, you think we'll ever get back home? - I don't know. - Hey, you guys! Hurry up! - Jenny! (Grant laughing) - Jenny! We thought we'd lost you. - Are you all right, sweetheart? - Sure, Grandpa. Look! There's Daddy! - Oh! Hey, Richard! - Oh, Jenny. Guess what I got for you? - Thanks, Steve. - Come on. (moving string music) (Beth laughing) - Hey, boy, how are you? (UFOs whizzing) - It's beautiful. - Well, you know something? - What? - Maybe this was all meant to be. This is our new way of life. (inspirational music) (mysterious music) (dramatic music)
