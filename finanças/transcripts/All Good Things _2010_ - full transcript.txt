For the record, tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury your name. David Marks. And where were you born? New York City. Is your father still alive? Yes sir. Is your mother still alive? No sir. How old were you when your mother died? seven. Were you present when she died? Yes sir. And how did she die? She died a violent death. David, if you don't mind, I'm going to ask you some more about your past. David? I'm sorry? Your past. Yes, I'd like to make a collect call, please. David Marks. Dad, David. Huh? How am I gonna do that? I got on the tuxedo. Can't we just call a plumber? Yeah right, why would we do that? That doesn't make any sense. Why would you send a plumber to do a plumber's job, huh? What are you looking at, huh? Hi. Oh. Hi. I've forgotten why I'm here. I was gonna make some coffee. Excuse me? Do you want coffee? I was gonna make some. No thank you. Am I keeping you from something? Yeah. But it's something I'm dreading. Hey, do you have some kind of... I don't know, something I could put under here? Uh, yeah. Here. So how long ago did you move in? - On Sunday. - Oh. - From where? - Long Island. - Oh. - My mom's house. - Are you done? - I think I should stop. You know? I mean... I'm not a plumber. I mean, as you might have guessed. And I can't get a plumber in here until Monday. So, uh... I guess what I've done is, uh... Do you want help with that? Yeah. Uh, anyway, so I guess what I did was come out here to tell you that you have a leak and, uh, that you should get it fixed. You smell good. You're gonna be late. So? I'm always late. You could always blame me. Hi, David Marks. Sir, right this way. - Oh God. - Oh look, there. - Here, take this. - Go easy on him. Okay, I don't have to tell you... just ignore him and I apologize for anything he says between now and the time we leave. Late. Always late. Anybody who didn't know you would think you were a busy man. Oh, I see you brought a friend. - Katie. - Katie. Your full name, dear, always. Oh, Katherine McCarthy. Well, what a lovely young woman you are. You've even managed to make my vagabond son look handsome. He is handsome. David, I need you to meet the next senator from New York. And I didn't invite you here to help you get laid. - Ambassador Moynihan. - Sanford, congratulations. - Thank you. Welcome back. - Thank you. Liz. Always more gracious. Ambassador, you remember my eldest son David? David the heir apparent. Of course, how are you? - Fine, thank you. - Oh, and this is... - Katherine McCarthy. - Miss McCarthy. - My wife Elizabeth. - Ambassador. - Ah, the man himself. Thank you. - Here you go, Dad. Thanks, Daniel. Hey, shouldn't you be wearing white gloves? Screw you, David. - Is that Irish? - Excuse me? Moynihan, is that an Irish name? Gaelic. Originally Scottish-Gaelic. But my family... My friends, a man who's old enough to remember how 42nd Street used to be... Sanford Marks! Thank you, Mr. Mayor. My father had a vision for Times Square and he passed it on to me. Where there are peep shows and massage parlors, I see Broadway theaters restored to their former glory. And where there are dilapidated hotels, I see gleaming office towers bustling with the important business of this city. It's my hope I can help breathe life back into this neighborhood that was so dear to my father, a man who placed great trust in me to carry on his legacy. To Howard Marks. David, tell me about the family business. Has the Marks Organization always been a powerful entity in New York? We were always in the top five or six property owners in Manhattan. Was it work that you were interested in? no sir. - A health food store? - Silly, right? No, I... I think that's great. - Really? - Yeah. Where? I was thinking in Vermont maybe. What do you do? I want to go to medical school, but since my dad died... It funny how hard it is just to do what you want, huh? - Yeah. - I bet you could do anything. #Oklahoma, where the wind comes sweeping down the plains # # And the waving wheat # # Can sure smell sweet # # When the wind comes... right behind the plains! # # Then when we say-yyy # # Hey, a-yip-i-o-ee-ay! # # We're only singing # # You're doing fine, Oklahoma... # Did your father approve of you living with Katherine McCarthy? Well, he didn't really have a problem with that, but he wanted me to live in New York and to go into the family business. Thank you. What did you do instead? Katie and I moved to Vermont. We lived this sort of a back-to-the-land kind of lifestyle. We bought a small piece of land and we ran a health food store. It's perfect. She's certainly a very enthusiastic young woman. - Where did you find her? - 53rd Street. She had a leaky faucet. Ah yes, the famous leaky faucet of 53rd Street. Aren't you sorry you gave up a promising career - in real estate? - No. You're ignoring a very hard fact of life, David. What's that? - She's never gonna be one of us. - No, I know. Isn't that great? Don't forget your racquet. ...a million miles away. It's just like picking off another part of your forehead. I'll burn you. Just you. The rest of you, you're fine, but that part, - forget it. - David? You're talking to yourself. David, I hope you brought an appetite! The ham looks delicious, Mom. ...you squeeze one time and you get ketchup and mustard, I call it Kepustard. Kepustard! Katie, your brother's going to be a millionaire. - Pass that ham down. - David, what does your family usually do for the holidays? We're going... ahem. We're going skiing. Oh, skiing! I'm gonna teach David how to ski. I'd be scared too. - You look terrific. - Thank you. - Doesn't she look terrific? - She's a beautiful girl. The Marks family. Marks. Are you kidding? They own half of Times Square. Can we please not talk about this now? Which half of Times Square? What are you talking about? - I'm just saying. - He's taking her to Paris. - That's what she said. - Hey! Whatever happened to my trip to Paris? You'd be lucky to get a trip to Paris, New Jersey. Mom's making coffee. - What? - Why are you hiding? I'm not. Is it awful? Awful? Is it awful? No, it's not awful at all. It's just different, that's all. It's just very different. You know, everybody talks to each other and there's a ham with pineapples on it with little cherries in the middle. - Cherries, I like those cherries. - Yeah, I like them too. It's just really different. Will you marry me? What? Was that a yes? - Thank you. - This was nice. Yeah. We just wanted to do it, to make it official. It's $39.50 each. That includes a generous tip. Oh. I'm sorry. Yeah. Thanks, Mom. - You're welcome, sweetheart. - Thank you. You're welcome. So the guy's not selling and his kids are starving. And he's sitting on the world's most valuable butcher shop. But my dad wouldn't give up. He used to say "There's always a way to convince a holdout." You know? I came around. Sooner or later everybody does. Oh, David. - Look who's here. - Oh, speak of the devil. Your grandfather didn't come hat in hand to ask me to join the firm. It was understood. I understood it. Your brother understands it and you do too. We're happy here, okay? - I'm subsidizing that. - Yeah, only until we get settled. Settled? You think she's happy here? - Isn't she? - You think she had this dump in mind when she left Mineola? When she laid eyes on you? No, she had more in mind and she deserves better. She's a beautiful woman. Just like your mother. - Thanks for visiting. - Thank you, honey. I'd better get back to work. How do you think my son can afford to live like this? What? Take me to the airport. Best of luck. Do you have a place picked out in New York yet? No. Then why did you sell it? I guess I thought it was what I should do. And I went along with my father's wishes and I agreed to go into the family business. Some of our Times Square tenants pay their rent in cash, so you'll pick it up in person. Solly, give him the address of the Luxor. Sure. When you get down there, you'll see why I'm sending you. These people are not really corporate. But these properties need to pay for themselves. That is, until we tear 'em down. And ultimately I think maybe you can manage the whole area. Well, it's good to have you here, son. You keep Solly in the loop, huh? Explain to the jury, please, what the family business consisted of. My grandfather owned land in Midtown which was, once upon a time, a farm. And as the area developed, we built apartments and office buildings and whatever was appropriate for the time. Here! What did you do for the Marks Organization? some leasing, but mostly you know, bookkeeping. I followed the kid all night. Massage parlors, peep shows, porn theaters. All people see are the fancy office towers. But Marks owns some of the worst buildings in Times Square. - He's the problem. - What do you want from me? We need to take the offensive, Mr. Mayor. - Let me use the police. - Relax, Sidney. We'll get what we want. Remember, we're just the custodians. This guy owns the place. Ow. - My eyes are closed. - Close your eyes. - My eyes are closed. - I swear to God, if I'm going to be a captain of industry, we might as well enjoy the perks. - You're looking. - No I'm not. Okay. - Do you want to count it down? - You do it. - Five... - Mm-hmm. ...four, three, two, one. Open them. Oh. Ohh. Oh my gosh. You like it up there or you want to come down? - I want to come down. - Come on down. Hi. It's gonna be so beautiful here. Do you ever think about having kids? Come on. Don't you want a little David running around the house? Pulling at your toes in the morning? Smushing food in your hair? Are you saying no? Can't we just talk more about the apartment and, you know, whether this is going to be a dining room or a living room? Or... you know? Are you saying "not now" about kids or not ever? Not ever. David... is there something wrong with you? Yeah. There is something wrong with me. Are you saying no? David? Yeah? Are you okay? David, did you ever have any kind of psychiatric treatment? Well, after my mother died, I was sent to psychiatrists. A lot of them, actually. I didn't find them very helpful. Was there anyone in your life with whom you did talk openly about your past? David, you cocksucker! Get over here and give me a hug. # Boogie! # # Get down, boogie oogie oogie... # - How are you? - # Get down # # Boogie oogie oogie # # Get down # - # Boogie oogie oogie... # - Look at her. I swear to God, I had no idea that people like her even existed. She's perfect. What do you mean by perfect? I mean there's nothing that I do that she doesn't like. She hasn't known you long enough. It must be so exciting, having your first book published? You know, I was thinking of taking some classes. - Maybe premed. - How's, uh... how's David doing working for his dad? Oh, he doesn't say or he just says "Okay." Well, that's him. It's like... like when he lost his mother. - When did she pass away? - Pass away? She jumped off the roof, cracked her skull open like a walnut on the driveway. David saw the whole thing. He hid under a table for a week. When he came out, it was... it was like he never had one. One what? A mother. And... and that was it. Excuse me, Katie. Smile. She's very sweet. - Unbelievable. - What? You're the only person I know that can say "sweet" like you're cursing. I did... sweet is a great thing. - I wish I was sweet. - Yeah, I wish you were sweet too. - Mm-hmm. - What'd you say to her? Nothing. I didn't say anything to her. - We were just talking. I just met her. - Nothing? Mm-hmm. Anyway. I've missed you. Quit it! I'm being sweet. I've missed you. I've missed you too. You surprised me a little. You're married to a nice blonde shiksa? Well, I wouldn't put it like that. You're working for... you're working for your dad, David? Which you said you'd never do. - When's the baby shower? - Come on. You know, it's still me. Does that girl know how fucked up you are? No, we're gonna... we're gonna straighten you out, David. We are. I know a great therapist and you're gonna love her because... because she does house calls. Try to focus on your breathing. It's not so much the memory, but the feeling... the feeling the memory evokes. Okay okay? - Again? - Yeah. Shit. Jesus. How did you and Katie feel about your new life in the city? Well, New York commercial real estate is very, you know, it's button-down and white shoe, and I really wasn't set up for that. But Katie seemed to like the city and she'd fixed up the apartment and... and eventually we even ended up buying a weekend place on a lake in Westchester. Am I... am I overdressed? You look beautiful. Oh! This place must have cost a pretty penny. Do you think all of these people drove up from the city? # In the morning you go gunning # # For the man who stole your water... # Hey, we're looking for Katie. Oh, my brother's here. Come on. - Katie. - Hi. # And the mourners are all silent... # Oh my God, disco people. Honey, babe... # But the hangman isn't hanging... # You know, I really think it's quite unique. Of course I'd love to pick your brain - about the business plan. - # Go back, Jack, do it again... # Get up. Dance with me. # Wheel turnin' round and round # # You go back... # Thank you for inviting us. It's nice to finally meet the neighbors. Can I touch your belly? Sure. It's moving. She's moving. - How do you know? - I just do. Before we walked over, Barry tried on every shirt he owns. We don't get out much. Most of these people are David's friends. I don't even think he knows half of them. Oh, I thought they were your friends. Some of them. I guess it's just the way people act around you. They sort of favor you. Maybe because I'm pregnant. Are you?! You're the first person I've told. That's wonderful! How far along are you? I just found out. I don't know how it happened. It wasn't planned. - That's not what I said. - You said that you couldn't, - that it wasn't possible. - That's not what I said. That there was something wrong with you. I didn't say that. - Yes you did. - What's the difference? All the difference in the world. Look, we've got an apartment in Manhattan. We got a house in the country. - We got a Mercedes. - I don't care about all of that. - You don't care... - I care about you, David. I want to have your child. David! Okay, if you don't care, we'll just go back to Vermont. Fine, we'll go back to Vermont, fine. We'll do whatever you want to do. Please, David. It won't be like when you grew up. What do you know about it? I'm not blind. David? Look at me. You make me out to be this person that you... think that I am. But I'm not that person. You can ask me anything you want. Anything, anything. Anything and I'll do it. Just don't ask me this. I can't do this. Are you ready? Uh, I gotta make a stop. On the way. What are we doing here? What is this place? I gotta make a call. I'm at the Luxor and there's cops everywhere. Listen to me, go over to the Avon. They may be next. No, you gotta find somebody else, okay? I gotta take Katie somewhere. What the hell are you talking about? The mayor's not available. David, get your ass over to the Avon and pick up the cash! Jeez! Uh... you go ahead and I'll be right behind you, okay? I'll be there. Mr. Marks? Mrs. Marks? I'm sorry, we'll have to get started. David! Hey, David, David. Hey, if it isn't the happy couple. They can't seat us for like an hour. Do you mind, David? Is that okay? Uh, can we pull a chair over here, please? Is that okay? Thank you. - Thank you, thank you. - My pleasure. So I heard about all the excitement today. Your old man must have had you running all over town. Sit. I'll go. I'll go, I'll go. What is wrong with you? I'm sorry. That's just Todd. He is completely unaware of anyone else around him. Which just makes him an asshole. Let's step into my office. Come on, it'll cheer you up. Have you done this before? No. You're just gonna snort it back fast, like this. Trust me, whatever's on your mind now, it won't be. # Tonight # # Last dance # # Last chance for love... # Do you want something? # For romance tonight # # Oh, I need you # # By me # # Beside me to guide me # # To hold me # # To scold me # # 'Cause when I'm bad, I'm so so bad # # So let's dance... # tough comparisons and increased piracy may help. The inventory issue is likely one time in nature. However, piracy is an ongoing problem for Microsoft. The most damaging... In the next few years, how did things change? We began sort of living separate lives. Katie lived at our lake house. She was going to college near there. So it made sense, I guess, and... I was still working in the city, so that kept me busy. Did you even tell him you applied to medical school? - Not yet. - You have to tell him. I know, I... it's because of school, you know. I'm here during the week and we only see each other on the weekends. Yeah well, he's gonna find out anyway, because you're gonna get in. David? What are you doing? It was drifting away. I don't want anybody to steal it. Oh, David. Hi, you've reached David and Katie. Leave a message. Hi, it's me. I don't know what time it is. It's late. It's so quiet here. The smallest sounds are keeping me up. Anyway, I just wanted to say I miss you and I wanted to hear your voice. I hope you're still coming tomorrow. It would mean a lot to me. Harriet, just say it. You can enjoy smoking, all right? No, 'cause you called me. My little sister's going to go to medical school. Can you believe this? Congratulations, David. You must be so proud. - Where is the campus? - It's in the Bronx. It's in the city. And it has one of the best pediatric programs in the country. Jim, I always thought you would become the doctor. Thank you, Ma. That's nice. I feel much better about my life. I'm kidding. That's real nice, Mom. It's all right, Jim. I can't find your jacket. Do you know where you put it? Oh, you're not leaving? - No. - Yes. - I gotta drive... - Sit down, David. Come on, what are you drinking? I gotta drive all the way back to the city. So, Katie? Uh... what? I... I... I'm not going anywhere. Jim, Jim, sit down. - I'm just... I'll go start the car. - Do whatever you want. I'm not... I'm not leaving yet. What? What is so important that we have to rush home for? What, David? I'll be waiting in the car. "What's so important that we have to rush home for?" # That's the way I've always heard it should be # # You want to marry me... # Where are you going? Where you going to go? Where you going to live? 'Cause if you leave me, I'm not going to be able to subsidize your lifestyle. Which I don't think that you want. I don't want that. Look, can we just... think about this for a second? I've never been closer to anyone and I don't know you at all. Maybe I should go stay at my mom's until I sort things out. You're joking, right? Why would you give up everything you've done just because of him? And you're not leaving New York to move back to... Long Island... yuck. Ma'am, I'm sorry. Your card was declined. What? I... - Try it again. - Well, I already did. - I don't understand. - Do you have another card, or cash? It's only $22.75. - I know how much it is. - Here. What the hell are you looking at? Eat your salad. I just need enough money to get through school. Look, I'm trying to explain. Your husband is the beneficiary of a number of family trusts, most of which were set up a long time ago. I know that. That means that as long as you're married, you can have access to his money, but if you separate, if you divorce him, you won't get any money, because he doesn't have any. Not of his own. - Motherfuckers. - Regardless, families like the Marks set their assets up this way - to protect them from divorces. - Motherfuckers! Okay, could you just not... just not do that? These people play hardball. If you want a settlement, you're gonna have to think of a way to motivate them. How was your day? Good. I... had lunch with Lauren today. What else did you do today? What the hell is that? Someone's on the terrace. Call the police. Oh God. Jesus, Jesus. What happened? What the hell happened? - Kel, call the police. - No no. No! No no no. No no no... Shh-shh, okay. David. Katie's next door with us. - She's scared to come home. - Mm-hmm. Well, we had a fight. But it's nothing, you know? It's nothing. I mean, it's not nothing, but you can tell her to come home. It's over. Will you tell her to come home, please? Actually I think she should stay with us tonight. Just let things cool off between you. Thank you. Good night. Thank you. - Hi, Lula. - Hello, Mrs. Marks. - is David in? - No, he's upstairs with his brother. Okay, I'll be in his office. I'm just gonna make some calls. At the tone, the time will be 11.59... At the tone, the time will be 11.59 and 20 seconds. At the tone, the time will be 11.59 and 40 seconds. I'm going to lunch now, Mrs. Marks. Okay, Lula. Thanks. At the tone, the time will be ...12.10 and 40 seconds. Good evening, Mrs. Marks. - Send it back. - Excuse me, sir? It's a family matter. It has nothing to do with us. It's not just that you barely show up for work or that you can't control your home situation, when you are here, you're stoned most of the time. This is untenable. There's an office on three. It's out of the way. No one will bother you. You won't have to bother with anything. You keep your secretary, get your mail... I don't know what else to say. Dad? Why couldn't you just have given her what she wanted? You're a very weak man, David. Did there come a time when your father passed on control of the Marks Organization? Not to you, but to your younger brother? Oh yeah, that's correct. When that happened, how did you feel? I was glad. Oh my God, Katie. - I'm sorry. - No no, you said you weren't coming. Is everything okay? Oh, I... I don't know. No. Is Mom home? No, she's still in Florida. Oh! I couldn't resist. He... died when I was 16. Uh, I don't remember much. 10 years! How did that happen, you know? And he does love me. But I have to look out for me now. I have my whole life to live. My father used to say "We should never regret the things we do, only the things we don't do." But... I had... I had an abortion. And I don't know what that is. If it's something I did, or something I didn't do. Hello? David? Katie? Katie, don't cry. Don't cry. You have to let me go. This is killing me. Oh, I know, I know. I know that now. Just come home. I can make this better, I promise. Baby, just come home. Please. Please. Katie? Katie? What are you looking at? Katie? Hey, Katie, where are you going? I'm going home. I'll call you in the morning. You can't drive like this. You've been drinking. Come on. Come on. Hey. What are you doing? You hungry? Where's Ivan? the kennel. Oh, why? You know he hates it there. Yeah, I know, but he bit me. Here. I'm cold. What is it? You would have made a good mother. So what am I doing here? She must have hated you. Your mother was a very sick woman, David. She wasn't always like that though. She was happy. I did everything I could for her, just like I did for you. Y-you... you let me, uh... stay out there and watch her jump. I told the nanny to take you inside. That's not true. You left me out there to watch. I saw her there, you know? On the driveway. I thought she was sleeping so I tried to wake her up. - I touched her head... - This is morbid. Give me that. How come you didn't just pick me up, Dad? How come you just didn't take me inside? I thought if she saw you standing there... she wouldn't jump. I'm going to bed. Go home to your wife. She's gone. What are you talking about? Now I'm just like you. David! Something happened in 1982 that kinda turned your world upside down. David! Yes sir. We, uh... we went to the lake for the weekend and I put her on the train to go back into the city that evening and that was the last time I ever saw her. But according to statements made to the police at the time she was in fact seen later that night at your apartment in the city. Miss Katie. Yes sir. Your doorman said he saw her the next morning, making a phone call and getting into a taxicab. Is that correct? Uh, yeah, that's correct. So at the time there was a substantial investigation into Katie's disappearance. Yes sir. And were you ever considered a suspect? No. As you know, Katherine Marks has been missing now for five days. David, her husband, is very distraught. And so he's asked that I speak to you on his behalf. Now the Marks family is offering a $15,000 reward for any information that leads to the discovery of Katie's whereabouts. I'm sorry, but, uh, for the moment that's all I'm able to tell you. Thank you. Thank you. There'll be no more questions at this time. - Can we just get a phone number? - Thank you. Please, can you just respect the family's need for privacy at this very very difficult time? We'll keep you up to date if anything new comes along. Where are we going next? Uh, we haven't covered West End below 70th. We can start again early in the morning. Yeah. It's all right. So, David, I want to get you now to the year 2000. if I could have some water? Right away. Thank you for coming on such short notice. Due to new evidence and a close look at the case, I've decided to reopen the investigation into the disappearance of Katherine Marks. Katherine disappeared in 1982, almost 20 years ago and she remains a missing person to this day. Now there are plenty of people who thought they got away with crimes that we're now finding can be solved based on DNA and other forensic evidence. And I'm sure that puts a lot of people on edge right now. I'll take your questions. Well, what did you believe was going on? Well, it was clear to me that the district attorney was reopening the investigation to further her political career. There wasn't anybody who didn't know about it. You couldn't walk down the street, you couldn't walk past the newspaper stand. It was just, you know, everywhere. What did you do then? I... intended to fill up my car with clothing and linen and go somewhere and hide and disguise myself. It seemed to me that the problem was being David Marks... so I just wanted not to be David Marks anymore. Hey! Do you mind? Can you just hold it down a little bit? You know, it's just very abrasive on my ears. And you don't have to let the door slam like that. You know, I just need a little consideration. What? So now you're living in Galveston, Texas, and you meet Malvern Bump for the first time. Did you pretend to be mute? Uh, yeah. Yeah well, just be sure and turn the hall light off when you're coming and leaving, 'cause it's on my meter. Do you think Malvern believed you were a mute? I doubt it. Do you think he believed you were a woman? Probably not. 18 years ago this lakeside cottage was a weekend retreat for New York real estate heir David Marks and his wife Katherine, a beautiful young medical student. Now according to Westchester County District Attorney Janice Rizzo, it is being considered a possible crime scene. Earlier today, in an exhaustive search, cadaver dogs uncovered a body. Unfortunately for hopeful investigators, it was just the remains of a dead dog. Sources inside the DA's office say that Rizzo's interest in the case was triggered by an unpublished manuscript written by this woman, Deborah Lehrman. Lehrman's novel apparently describes a murder, the details of which are strikingly similar... ...to those surrounding the disappearance of Katie Marks in 1982. Investigators are also interested in talking to David Marks, but at the moment, no one seems to be able to find him. Reporting live... Leave a message. David, it's Deborah. I can't believe this is happening again. I don't know how people get my number. First it was this... it was this reporter and now a cop's calling from New York every five minutes. And I want to be there for you, David, uh, I do, but, uh... I have my own problems now. Fuck... I had an accident. It's nothing serious, but my car needs... it needs some repairs. As you know, life in Los Angeles without one is impossible. Come on, let's go. - And uh... - Lulu, let's go. Oh fuck! - Shit. Come on. - I hate myself for asking, but... I need more money. Come on! I don't know if this is record... Leave a message. David, why are you avoiding me? I've always been there for you. I've been a good... a good friend to you. Don't you fucking... Who says I'm bothering 'em? I pay my rent like everybody else. You've got 30 days, Malvern! I pay you! I pay good money for this shithole! Get away. I got rights here. What rights? You got 30 days to get out, Malvern. You're lucky I don't call the cops. - Where am I gonna go? - Whatever. You got 30 days, Malvern. And stop turning off the goddamn light. It's on my meter. What sort of relationship developed between you and Malvern? We became good friends. Where the hell did you learn to shoot like that? - The Purple Heart... - I swear to God. ...for a sunburn. And then we spent the entire war shooting coconuts off the side of the boat. Why do you wear all that shit for anyway? What? The girl stuff. You like that kind of thing? No. I guess... I just kinda want to disappear for a little while. What about you? Is that why you came out here? Yeah. Me, I... I disappeared a long time ago. Oh. You know, I'm not always home and I know how you like to watch television. So... You seem like someone I can trust. You know, I may need you to do something for me one day. Thanks. In the days and weeks to come, did Malvern become aware that you had a lot of money? I mean, he became aware that I was planning on buying a house. What effect did you see that have on Malvern? Uh... well, Malvern had a problem. He was getting evicted and I guess he thought I was gonna be the solution. I can remember looking at houses together, and, you know, he was saying things like, "Well, this would be a good place for you to buy because there'd be room for me over there." Yeah, it was very uncomfortable. This place might be good for us, Malvern. Leave a message. David, I need to see you. You need to come out here. If I don't hear from you, I... I'm gonna blow the lid off things. You know what I'm talking about. David? I know. David? David! You didn't give me time to clean up. - Turn that down. - Eclipse the 400,000 watermark ...to 411,000 last week... - Cocksucker. David, you're gonna go deaf. Leave a message. David, are you there? Everything is taken care of. You told me to call, so... I'm calling. I just need something to eat. I haven't had anything to eat and there's no food here. So I thought, well, maybe I'd stop on the way back and... Hello, yes, my friend and I came to your open house a few weeks ago, uh, for unit 107. Deborah Lehrman wasn't just killed, it was an execution. Her death is a very questionable death, Michelle. Not just in terms of the fact that it was a homicide, but the timing is extremely curious. Curious because Deborah Lehrman was murdered just before District Attorney Janice Rizzo had intended to question her about another mystery... the disappearance 20 years earlier of a beautiful young medical student named Katherine... Okay, you have the "Post" interview, Marks, then a phoner with W.I.N.S. also about the Marks case, which we can do from the car. We got a call from Albany. They want you to do that meeting tonight. - Got the numbers I asked for? - Yeah. They've been very generous to the governor. Totals are in the last column. These are all from the Marks family? I'll have to change. Leave a message. David? Come on, David. I know what's going on. I talked to the broker. She said you... she says you never even made an offer. I trusted you. We had a deal. Pick up the fucking phone! - Hello. - Mr. Sachs. - Solly. Good to see you. - You too. - Pl-please. - Yes. Oh. - No no, don't get up. - Thank you for coming. My pleasure. Now what can I do for you? Some things have been happening that have been quite uncomfortable for my family. You want the ship to go down? We're in a typhoon. So, David, on the night in question you came home and found Malvern had been evicted. Uh, yes. Explain to the jury, please, what happened then. ...that pays attention to my orders? Engine room reports number one switchboard shorted out by saltwater. Shifted to number two. Can't do much better heading into the wind. I trusted you! Fleet course is 1800. Captain, we're in serious trouble. Mr. Marik, if you question my decisions once more, I'll order you off this bridge. You're not giving orders on this bridge anymore. I've relieved you... Mr. Marik, you're under arrest... So Malvern came at you with a gun? That's correct. He, uh, had been evicted and he was desperate. He demanded that I take him in. And I just wasn't gonna do that. Uh, there was a struggle and then the gun went off. All right then. If Malvern's death was a matter of self-defense, why didn't you call the police? Because I knew that no one would believe me. I just knew that no one would believe that it was an accident. So I had to get rid of the body. So no one would believe you because of your past? - I'm sorry? - Your past. Now let's clear that up. Set the record straight. Did you kill your best friend Deborah Lehrman? David, you're gonna go deaf. No. Can you think of any connection between the death of Deborah Lehrman and the disappearance of your wife Katie Marks? No sir. David, is there anything you would like to add? David! Anything else, David? No. Thank you, David. I have no more questions.
