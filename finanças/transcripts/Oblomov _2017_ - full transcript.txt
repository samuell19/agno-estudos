That is true. What is... What is wrong with me? What a disgrace this is. I must get to work. The moment I indulge myself, I... Zakhar! Zakhar... Oh, that damn letter. Zakhar. Zakhar! Find me the letter I received from the estate yesterday. What did you do with it? Which letter? I haven't seen any letter. The postman gave it to you. It was all dirty. What did I do with it? What do I know? You never know anything. Look by the chair. Perhaps it slipped under the sofa? And the back, still not fixed. Is it too hard to call the carpenter? You broke it. A back doesn't last forever. It was bound to break. Hello, Ilya Ilyich. Ivan Alexeyevich. What are you doing here? Ilya Ilyich, I have come to pick you up. To go where? To Ovchinin's and Ekaterinhov. Why would we go to Ekaterinhov? Don't you know that today is May 1st? Have a seat. Let us think about it. Well? Have you found it? Why there it is, under you. The end is poking out. You wanted the letter and you were lying on it! How clean you keep everything... The dust, the dirt... Good Lord, you won't lift a finger! "I" don't lift a finger? I wipe the dust and sweep every day. Nearly. What is this, then? And this? And that? All right... I will clear that. What about the dust on the walls, the cobwebs... How am I supposed to clean? You never go anywhere. How come that other people's houses are clean? Shouldn't you be at the office? They gave us the day off. Is it quieter now? Certainly not. We've been awfully busy since Holy Week. From 8 to noon, then from noon to 5, and I keep working at home. You work from 8 to noon, from noon to 5, and again in the evening? Sweet Jesus... Oh, my brave Alexeyev. My dear Ilya Ilyich. And to think we served together. Remember when you sent that urgent letter to Arkhangelsk instead of Astrakhan? What a blunder that was. And the false medical certificate that you sent so you wouldn't have to comply. "I hereby certify and attest "that secretary Ilya Ilyich Oblomov suffers "from cardiac hypertrophy with dilation of ventricle, "as well as chronic liver pain. "Therefore, in order to avoid such crises, "I deem it essential that Mr. Oblomov be prevented "from going to the office..." What's the matter? Excuse me? You are still lying down. Because I should get up? Well... I believe you were planning on going out. Going out? Where? I do not plan to go anywhere. We said we were going to Ovchinin's and Ekaterinhov. What is it? You don't like it here? Is it cold? Does it smell for you to be eager to leave? No. I am always comfortable here. Then spend the day with me. Stay for lunch, and tonight... As you wish. If that is what you want, I will do it. Life is so hard. It just won't leave me alone. Why does it take me so long to rise? I was sitting here, thinking. How can I get out of this misery? What is the matter? Matters. I don't know what to do. - What matters? - I'm being kicked out of my house. Can you imagine? I have to move out. The work, the worries... The thought of it scares me. Moving out is always a hassle. All that is lost and broken... Such a nuisance! The ceiling doesn't look solid, the plaster comes off but it still holds. I see. "Clear off", they say. "And fast". What would you do? Well, Ilya Ilyich... You could move in with my cousin, in Vyborg. Vyborg? Now that's something new! There are wolves there. They come from the islands. Why would you care? It's boring. It's an empty desert. My cousin owns a house with a garden. No different than a country house. She is a very refined woman, a widow, with two children. You could settle in with her. You would be in absolute peace. - No one would disturb you. - My, my. - It's clean... Spotless. - Why should I care? I won't go. You and your senseless ideas! The Vyborg quarter! I'm sorry, but it isn't wise. Moving is nothing. Read what my steward wrote to me. What did he do with the letter? Zakhar. Zakhar! Oh! Here you are. What do you know. He is offering me about 2,000 less. How am I going to live? I will starve. It is a substantial loss. Two thousand is no small amount. What would you do? Ilya Ilyich, you must reflect on it. If only Stolz could return sooner. My word, Ilya Ilyich, why don't you dismiss your Oblomovka steward? Who would I take instead? Do I know the peasants? Another one may be worse. I haven't been there in 12 years. What if you go? I could come with you. Me? Make the trip to the estate? You are making some drastic suggestions. Why don't you write to the governor? He may investigate your steward. I wish Andrei was here. He would fix everything for me. You should write. I'll sharpen your pen. Sharpen, sharpen... You do whatever you want. I will manage. Godspeed. Thank you. God forbid if I disturbed you. I will tell Ovchinin that they shouldn't expect us. Farewell, Ilya Ilyich. Ilya Ilyich is not the executor of someone else's mind. He is the creator and producer of his own ideas. Zakhar! Zakhar. How do my feet hold me? What's the matter now? There is no ink in the inkwell. How am I going to write? I will dilute it. So, Ilya Ilyich... So, what? What are you telling the landlord? About what? Well, about the move. I'm not writing to the landlord, I'm writing to the governor. Because I was thinking: other people are no worse than us, and yet they move. If they move, we can too... Pardon? What did you just say? "Other people... "are no worse"... Such is your thought. Very well. Now I know that for you, I am just as anybody else. But, Ilya Ilyich, am I comparing you to anyone? Scram! I don't want to see you again! "Other people". That's a good one. There you go. I wanted to devote the morning to productive work, but now my spirits will forever be at their lowest. All this because of whom? Because of my own loyal servant... Zakhar. Zakhar... Yes, sir? Come here. Pour me some kvass. How do you feel? Not well, are you? Do you understand your misdeed? But, Ilya Ilyich, I didn't say anything except... No, no, no... Wait. Wait. You have caused pain to your master. Have you caused me pain or not? I have caused you pain, Ilya Ilyich. Have you considered what other people are? Shall I tell you? Other people are men who dress themselves. They shine their shoes themselves. They don't know what a servant is. If they have an errand to run, they go alone. They have no one to send. That is what "other people" are. So, tell me, am I like other people? Do you think I am like them? No, sir. You are a completely different person. Do I get agitated? Do I work? What is the matter? Am I a sorry sight? Do I look too thin? Don't I eat enough? Who am I telling this to? You. Haven't you served me since I was a child? You know I have been brought up tenderly. I never wanted for nothing. I have never been cold or hungry. So tell me, how could you have the audacity to compare me to other people? I am asking you! How could you humiliate your master so deeply? Your master, whom you carried when he was a child, whom you have served and who fills you with blessings! No, Ilya Ilyich. It's out of stupidity. Yes, out of stupidity. And to say that I torment myself day and night, and sometimes my head burns and my heart clenches. I cannot sleep at night, and I writhe and I reflect! For whom? For the sake of whom? For the peasants' sake! Your sake! Perhaps when you see me under the covers, you figure I am just lying there, sleeping like a log! Well, no. I mull over a thought in my head, a great thought - that my peasants are no longer in need, that they do not envy other villages, that they do not complain about me on the Day of the Last Judgment before the Lord, our God... You, ingrate! And to think that in my plan, I had already assigned you a private house, a vegetable garden, a measure of wheat, in addition to your wages. At my house, you are the steward, the butler, the authorized representative. The peasants salute you with reverence. Zakhar Trofimovich. Is this how you thank me? Oh, my beloved Ilya Ilyich, sir... what is it that you say? Oh, Queen of Heaven, what a misfortune! All this trouble coming upon us like a storm in the blue sky! To redeem yourself, try to sort things out with the landlord so we don't have to move out. And pour me some more kvass. My mouth is dry. Hear how hoarse your master is. You should have noticed. See what you have done to me. Three o'clock? Only two more hours until we eat. What can we do in two hours? Nothing. Too bad. I will hand in the letter at the next collection, and I will draft my plan tomorrow, but... that's enough working for the common good. I'm going back to bed. I am exhausted. I will try to have some sleep until lunch time. Turn off the lights and wake me up at half after four. Life is so hard. It just won't leave me alone. Two misfortunes at once. How does one survive to that? To think I have not yet washed myself. How can that be possible? I wanted to set down my plan on paper and I did nothing. I didn't write to the landlord, I didn't even finish the letter to the governor. Other people would have done it all. Other people? Other people enjoy life. Other people... have interests. They want to see everything, know everything. But I... I... I am not like the other people. Why do I have to be the way I am? Mom is coming! Mom is coming! Over there, there is no ocean, no high mountains, no rocks or abysses or deep forests. Nothing grandiose, nothing wild, nothing dark. Over there, on the contrary, the sky seems to cuddle up to the Earth, as if to embrace it tighter, with love. Over there, the sun shines, bright and warm, for six months. Then it pulls away, albeit little by little, as if reluctantly. The cycle of seasons thus unfolds at an imperturbable and fair pace. What an unfortunate sight this is. Get up! Get up, Ilya Ilyich! Look around you! Leave me alone! I will wake up when I feel like it! Get up! Get up! How dare you disturb your master when he wishes to rest! Stolz! Andrei Ivanych! I am so happy to see you. So, how are you? How is your health? I am unwell, my dear Andrei. How could I be healthy? - You're ill? - Sties are killing me. I had one on my right eye, and look, now another one is flaring up. That's it? You sleep too much. And the heartburn... You should've heard the doctor. "Go abroad", he said. "Otherwise, it could end badly". - What will you do? - I am staying. - Why? - What do you mean? In his terms, I should go live in the mountains, or move to Egypt, or even America. Fifteen days to Egypt, three weeks to America. You too, Andrei? My only friend is going crazy. Who in their right mind goes to Egypt or America? The English, but it was God who made them that way. They have nowhere to live, but who would do such an effort in this country? A hotspur, a desperate man. That's it. You will never change. So, tell me, how are things going at Oblomovka? - What's the matter? - I am completely ruined. How is that? Let me show you the letter from my steward. Where did he put it now? Zakhar! What a scoundrel he is. Isn't it a misfortune? So you don't know? They want to build a pier in Verkhliovo and a road, And there will be a town fair. Good Lord, that is all needed. But Oblomovka was so peaceful, so isolated, and now there will be a road, a fair! The peasants will turn to the city, they will be corrupted. They will need tea, coffee, velvet trousers, there will be merchants... This is a disaster. Certainly, nothing good can come out of that. Why don't you build a school in the village? Education is detrimental to peasants. Educate them, they will refuse to work. Quite the opposite - they will learn to work better. You, silly. Seriously, this year you must go to the village. I know, but my plan is not completely finished yet. You don't need a plan. You just have to go. You'll see what to do on the spot. That plan has been taking you so long. How come it isn't ready yet? Dear friend, if only my estate was my sole concern. - My other misfortune... - Yes? - I am being evicted. - Sorry? "Clear off, and fast". You are a spoiled child. Moving is no tragedy. Do you ever go out? Where do you go? Whom do you see? Where do I go? I don't go out much. I prefer to stay home. Besides, there's the plan and this whole moving thing. I don't see any books around. You don't... ...see any books? Ah. There you go. - Here's one. - What is it? - A Voyage To Africa. - Yes. The page where you stopped has gotten moldy. I don't see any newspapers. You do read newspapers. No. The typeface is too small. It damages the eyes. Besides, whenever there are news, that is all we hear about. Honestly, Ilya! What is going on with you? You are as limp as a rag. You close in on yourself and nothing else matters. You are right, Andrei. I am a rag. A true rag. Can being aware of it be an excuse? I am not looking for an excuse. No, Ilya. I will not leave you like this. In a week, you won't recognize yourself. Now get dressed. Zakhar, bring Ilya's clothes. I will shake you up. I cannot. Alexeyev is coming to dinner. - Zakhar, come and dress your master. - At once, dear sir. When Alexeyev arrives, tell him... we won't be dining at home. Ilya Ilyich will not be dining at home for the summer. He will have a lot to do in autumn, and will thus be unavailable. I will tell him. And... what about my dinner? Here. Eat with whoever you want. I will see to it, sir. Where are your shoes? Hurry up, will you. But... Where are we going? And... Why? What if I don't go? All this is senseless. We will eat on the way, make some visits... But why the hurry? Let me think about it. I haven't even shaved. There is no need to scratch your head. I will take you to the barbershop. What are these visits that we're going to make? Faster! Faster, please! The officers don't know which way to go. Am I invisible? Don't they notice me? I wonder if I am the reason for all this turmoil. Unless I have to play a role. What is this show? I hope it isn't a tragedy. My feet are on fire... Not taking off my shoes for days on end. My feet are on fire! I do not fancy your life in Petersburg. - What life do you fancy? - Not that one. What is it that displeases you so much? Everything. The constant race at breakneck speed, the everlasting game of pathetic little passions. The greed and the scrutinizing from head to toe. We look at people, they seem so profound, they look so serious, and all we hear is, "He earns this much. And he's got a rent. "By what right?", they cry. "He lost everything to gambling". "And he collected 300,000". And the boredom... Oh, the boredom! The boredom! Where is man in all this? Where is his entity? Where has it gone? Why does he concern himself with trifles? The world and society need distraction. To each his own interests. "The world and society". You purposely send me out into the world and society to rid me of the desire to be in it. Life is beautiful, nonetheless. What do you want from it? The matters of the heart and the mind, but not that! Wake up! Around which axis does all this rotate? There is none. Nothing cuts us to the quick. The people in society are dead, they are numb. They are worse than me. What guides them in life? They sure don't sleep. They flutter around like flies. Buzzing and buzzing... Don't they sit dead all day? Am I more guilty than them when I lie down without worrying about aces and jacks? You have said that oft. Got anything new? Are those men alive? Are they awake? They gather to eat as they go to work - no joy, no warmth. Why do they even gather together? Not a single genuine laugh, not a glimmer of sympathy. What kind of life is that? I don't want it. What could I possibly seek in it? You philosophize like an Ancient. Which is good. You're thinking, not sleeping. Well! What else? The rest. What "rest"? That is it. To hell with them. I shall leave them alone. But they don't lead a normal life. It's not life, it's a distortion of life, of the ideal of life that nature has set for us. What would this ideal, this norm of life be? - No, it isn't... - Tell me. What life would you conceive? - I have already conceived it. - You have? Tell me, please. How is it? How? Here is how. First, I would go back to the estate. What is stopping you from going? My plan is not finished. And I wouldn't go back alone, but with my wife. Much good may it do for you. Why not do it? In four years, no one will want you. In that case, it will be my destiny. Right. After your wedding, what would you do? I would settle in a new house fitted out for peace and quiet. I would have good neighbors. You, for example, except you wouldn't stay long. Because you would? - You wouldn't go anywhere? - No. How would you spend your days? I'd wake up in the morning. The sun is shining. The sky is blue. Very blue. Not a single little cloud. One of the facades of the house faces east, with a balcony over the garden, and a view of the village on the other side. As I wait for my wife to wake up, I put on my dressing gown and go down to the garden to smell the morning scents. There, I meet the gardener. Together, we water the flowers, we prune the hedges and the trees. I arrange a small bouquet for my wife, and I swim in the river. And when I come home, the window is open to the balcony. My wife is there in a blouse with her little night cap. It might fall off as soon as she moves. "The tea is ready", she says to me. That kiss... Oh, that tea... Oh, that soft chair... I sit at the table, and I savor the cookies, the cream, the fresh butter. And then? Then I put on - I don't know - a large jacket, I grab my wife by the waist, and together we sink into... a dark, endless alley. We both walk quietly, without saying a word, as if in a dream. We count the minutes of happiness like a heartbeat. We listen to the heart that beats and halts. We seek the echo of an emotion in nature, and without even realizing it, we come out on a river, a field. The river barely shimmers, the wind caresses the stalks. You are a poet, Ilya. Yes. A poet in life. Because life is poetry in itself. Except that man spends his time disfiguring it. Then, we reach the orangery. The kitchen, however, is hectic. Knives chopping parsley for the meatballs, spoons stirring the ice cream. And then, the guests arrive, like you and your wife. - You are marrying me too? - Yes, I am. Another couple of friends, always the same faces, and we pick up the conversation exactly where we left off the day before. We start bantering or we merge into an eloquent silence, a meditative one, that of the fullness of satisfied desires. A meditation of pleasure. After dinner... mocha, cigar on the patio. That is how our grandparents used to live. No. What do you think their life was like? Do you picture my wife making jam? No. Listen. The notes, the elegant furniture, the books, the grand piano, the music... The mere thought of that aria overwhelms me every time. How that woman pours out all her heart in her tears. What sadness in her chords. No one knows anything about her. She oppresses her secret and confides it to the Moon. You like that aria? Good for you. Olga Ilyinskaya sings it wonderfully. I will introduce you. She has a lovely voice. And how she sings! She herself is a charming child. Though I have a weakness for her. So I am biased. But don't get distracted. Don't get distracted. Please, go on. That would be it. The guests return to their rooms, and the next day everyone resumes their life. One goes fishing, another goes hunting... And the other one just sits there, doing nothing. No occupation? For the rest of his life? Until his hair grows white. Until he dies. That's what life is about. - No. That is not life. - What do you mean? - What is it, then? - It is... It is Oblomovism. Oblomovism? Oblomovism... What is the ideal life, then? What is not Oblomovism? The purpose of your rushes, your passions, your wars, your politics, your trade, isn't it a quest towards the ideal of paradise lost? Your utopia is oblomovist! Everybody longs for rest and tranquility. Not everybody. There was a time you didn't. I quote, "Life is nothing but work. "Anonymous, obscure, yet incessant work". Yes. "Dying with a sense of accomplishment". Oh, yes. I remember, Andrei. Yes... We wanted to travel all over Europe, and walk around Switzerland. And burn our soles on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius, and walk down to Herculaneum. We were quite insane. - How very silly. - Silly? Silly? Didn't you tell me, teary-eyed, "Let us make a vow not to die before we've seen this"? You would lock yourself up with the math teacher to understand why you had to learn all those circles and squares. But you gave up midway through and refused to understand. You started studying English, but then you quit. "I am yours, Andrei. "I'll follow you everywhere". You said that. Well, you see, Ilya, I have been abroad twice. I know Europe as my own estate. I have seen Russia from end to end. I work. You'll stop working someday. Never. Why would I? Once you have doubled your capital? Not even if I quadruple it. When will you live? Why torture yourself forever? For the sake of work itself. Work is image, the core element and purpose of life. Of my life, at least. You expelled all the work from your life... And what has it come to? I will attempt to lift you up, perhaps for the last time. It is now or never! Do not scold me, Andrei. Help me instead. Truly. I know everything, I understand everything, but I have no strength. I have no willpower. What you say is true - "It is now or never". One more year, and it will be too late. Is this really you, Ilya? But I remember you a sleek, lively young fellow. You used to walk every day from Oblomovka to Kudrino. There, in the garden, you wouldn't forget the two sisters. You would read them Rousseau, Schiller, Goethe, and Byron. You put on great airs to them. You refined their taste. You remember that too, Andrei? Of course... How I used to dream over them, whisper to them my hopes, nurture plans and ideas of all sorts, and feelings, too, though I kept them from you so you wouldn't laugh. That's where it all expired. Never has it been repeated. Why did it all fade away? Where did the sparkle go? What is the reason? Never have I gone through any great mental tempest or upheaval. You see, Andrei, at no point in my life have I been touched with a fire which could either save me or destroy me. From the first moment that I realized myself, I knew that I was on the wane. I was fading... as I sat at my desk, I was fading as I read books about truths I didn't know what to do with. I would even fade with friends, as I witnessed the debates, the chatter, the mean, ice-cold gossip... Emptiness. In town, I would only recognize spring when oysters and lobsters arrived. I was fading as I wasted my life and brains. Even my pride - what did I waste it on? On ordering clothes from a good tailor? On having my hand shaken by Prince so-and-so? Yet pride is the very salt of life. Where is mine gone? Either I haven't understood anything about life, or it's worth nothing. The fact is, I never saw anything, knew anything, and no one ever showed me anything that could be better. For the past 12 years, there had lain within me a light. A light that was seeking an outlet, but had been doomed to illumine only its own prison. And now it is gone out. That's it... my dear Andrei. Why didn't you tear yourself away from that? Why didn't you escape? Why did you die in silence? Escape where? Where? If only at your peasants', by the Volga. It is busier. There is motivation, objectives, work. I would have gone to Siberia... There you go with your drastic remedies. But am I alone in this? Look. The list is endless. Our name is legion. No. I won't leave you like this. I'll get you out of here. First, abroad and then to the countryside. You will slim down, and we will find you what to do. Yes. Let us go anywhere. Get a passport and pack your bags. In two weeks, we will be in Paris. This is too hasty! Let me think about it. I have Zakhar, and there are so many arrangements to be made... Oblomovism. Oblomovism. Remember - "To be or not to be". - Well... - It is now or never. Is it true that you are bored? Yes, it is true. But... not too much. I have some work to do. Andrei tells me that you are engaged in drawing up a plan? Yes. I intend to return to my home in the country, and I am making a few preparations for doing so. And you are going abroad? We agreed he would meet me as soon as his passport was ready. I entrust him to you. Are you glad to travel abroad? Yes, very glad. Let's say I often stay at my cottage in the country, and that's why Andrei thinks that... I expect you write a great deal. You read. - Have you read... - Not at all. Not at all, what? I thought you were going to ask me if I read novels, but I never read novels. No. I was thinking about travel books. You don't read novels? What do you read, then? Precisely, I am fond of books of travel. In Africa? Are you musical? I have told Olga Sergeyevna that you adore music. And I asked her to sing. Why do you slander me? I am by no means an adorer of music. Why, the man is offended. I introduce him in his best light and he disappoints me. That is not my intention. I am just not a connoisseur. But what kind of music do you favor? Your question is difficult to answer. I like everything. It's the truth. I can listen with pleasure to a cracked barrel-organ playing a random song which tunes stick in my memory. I can also walk out of an opera and be touched by a Meyerbeer piece or a fisherman song. It depends on my mood. There are moments when I could close my ears to Mozart. Then you truly love music. What will you sing to us, Olga Sergeyevna? What if Mr. Oblomov is feeling inclined to close his ears? I suppose I ought to utter some compliment, but I cannot do so. And even if I could, I would not. Why? What if you sing badly? Things would be awkward. - Do you want me to sing? - No, he wants it. Well, then I will sing for you. Prepare that compliment. Pardon me. Did you hear him? In all honesty, Ilya, how long has it been since such a thing happened to you? Olga Sergeyevna, I don't know how to explain it, but you sang like never before. I must leave. Ilya Ilyich, I ask you to join me without delay, as soon as your passport is ready. Goodbye, my friend. See you soon. Olga, please watch him. Keep him from staying home, from sleeping, and even from lying on his sofa. And while you are at it, keep him from wearing odd socks. Make him read and write. Your wish will be his command. He won't sleep. He will love what he has ceased to love. When you see him again, you won't recognize him. Oh, Andrei... I want you to feel at ease. Free. Light. Tell me, what do I have to do to keep you from being bored? Sing. That's the compliment I was waiting for. You know, earlier, when I sang, if you hadn't uttered that gasp, I wouldn't have slept at night. - I might have even cried. - Why? I don't know. Because you have pride, that is why. Yes, I suppose so. That must be why. But we all have pride galore. Andrei Ivanovich says it may be the only driving force of our willpower. But you do not seem to have any. That's why you're always... I'm always what? No, I was just saying. If I love Andrei Ivanovich, it's not because he makes me laugh. I sometimes cry when he talks. And it's not because he loves me... But he loves me more than the rest. Do you see where pride goes? - Do you love Andrei? - Of course. If he loves me more, the rest goes without saying. He loves other girls... but not the way he loves me. He will never make them laugh. He will never bare his soul. And for that, I love him even more. Pride. If after my singing, you hadn't said a word, or made a gesture, I think I would have fallen ill. It's the truth. That's pride. Because you noticed something on my face? Tears. Even if you hid them. Bad habit. Men are ashamed of their emotions. Even Andrei is ashamed of his emotions. I told him, he admitted it. And you? What wouldn't one wish when looking at you? Yet another compliment, and not a minor one. A platitude. What is wrong? My God, you are crying. How deeply you must feel music. It is not music that I am feeling. It is love. What have I done? I have barely met her. I ruined everything. No man would have said such a thing to a woman he was seeing for the first time. No one would have fallen in love so quickly. Only I am... ...suited for passion and tears. But do they suit me? I swear to God. Passion is best in poems or on stage, where actors, with their capes and swords, stride around before dining together, murderers and victims reunited. If only passions could end like that, but no. They leave behind a trail of smoke and stench, but never happiness. Nothing but shame enough to tear your hair out. One must set limits to passion. It needs to be suffocated and drowned in marriage. Isn't it everybody's goal to find in our partner a constant image of calm and peace? The eternal and steady course of sentiment. Such is the norm of love. The moment we stray from it, we suffer. And I wonder - isn't my ideal the same as everyone else's? Ilya Ilyich? Olga Sergeyevna. - Hello. - Hello. Am I disturbing you? No, not at all. Have you had a letter from Andrei Ivanovich? - Yes. - What has he written? He calls me to Paris. - What are you going to do? - I will go. - When? - Right away. No. Tomorrow. I mean, as soon as I pack my bags. Why the hurry? Speak. Why do you wish to leave? Something is bothering me, hurting me, burning me, you know. Why do I see sadness in your eyes? Why should I be happy, Olga Sergeyevna, and how? Move about? For that, one must have a purpose. But what purpose could I have? I have no purpose. The purpose is to live. When there is no reason to live, one lives from day to day, and is glad that the night comes so as to sink into sleep. The tedious questions arise - why did I live this day? Why do I have to go through tomorrow? Why do we live life? Is there a life that can be useless? Yes. Mine, for instance. Don't laugh. It's true. What would I aim my thoughts, my intentions at? The flower of life has withered. All I have is thorns. Smell this nice scent. Do you like roses? No, they are too scented. I don't really like flowers. In the meadows, fine, but in a room, all the hassle, the dirt... Because you prefer a clean room, you can't stand dirt? That would be my servant - he is... Will you go straight to Paris? Yes. Stolz has been waiting for much too long. But why so soon? Nothing is driving you out. There is something. - What would that be? - Shame. - Shame? - Yes, Olga Sergeyevna. You are undoubtedly surprised. You must resent me. I had completely forgotten. Believe me, I could not stop myself. Forget about it! Forget it! Especially since it wasn't true! It wasn't true? It was a moment of folly... of music. Music only? So you are not upset? Everything is behind? What are you talking about? I have forgotten. Goodbye. Promise me that you have forgotten everything. I forgot everything. Give me your hand as a sign of truce. You are upset. Don't leave me with such a burden on my heart. If it's true you would have cried hadn't you heard me gasp when you started singing, and if you... - I shall not sing again. - I beg you. Have mercy. I will fall ill. My knees are shaking, I can barely stand. What is wrong? I feel like crying when I look at you. See? I have no pride. I am not ashamed of my heart. Then why would you cry? I hear your voice again. I feel once again that I... Yes? The same music, the same emotion, the same feeling... Please forgive me, for I can't help it. Mr. Oblomov... I do not resent you, and I forgive you. Only in the future... My Lord, what have I done? All I did... All I did was to further offend her. I wanted to apologize! And she... Oh, my God. Could it be possible? What a thought. Olga. Olga! - Greetings, Ilya Ilyich. - Olga... Is that you, Ivan Alexeyevich? Good Lord! How beautiful she is! And her face, so white and elegant... I will take her to the Roman ruins, to the streets of London and Paris, and to our earthly paradise in Oblomovka. - Who are you talking about? - Olga Sergeyevna! Incidentally, I went... to the bakery earlier and I ran into the lady. - Which lady? - Which lady? Miss Ilyinskaya, Olga Sergeyevna. And? And she asked me to say hello to you. She wanted to know what you were doing, and if you were doing well. What did you tell her? I told her that you were doing well. "What could possibly happen to him?", I said. As if we needed your stupid remarks. "What could happen to him?" And then? Then she asked where you had lunch today. - And? - I replied, "At home". I told her that you had dined at home as well, and that you ate two chickens. Idiot! Why am I an idiot? Isn't that the truth? I can even show you the bones. What an idiot! - And what did she say? - She smiled. And then she said, "All of two chickens?" Oh, Lord, what an idiot. My goodness... What else did she ask? She asked what you have been doing over the past few days. Oh, no... And you replied...? "Nothing", I said. "He stayed in bed". Get out! I don't want to see you again! As of today, I promise - less food, more strolling and no wine. All this to say that the lady will be waiting for you... Why didn't you tell me? You didn't give me a chance, sir. You threw me out. Are you trying to kill me, Zakhar? Where is she waiting for me? Where shall I meet her? I have been looking for you. I was afraid you wouldn't find me. What have you done today? Today? Well... Did you argue with Zakhar again? Have you read the books I recommended you? Yes. I read History of Discoveries and Inventions. - In Russian? - No, in English. You read in English? Poorly, but I do. Read me some, then. Well... Here we go. By chance. Indeed we did. What is this? You can see it is a branch. A branch? - A branch of lilac. - I can see that. But what does it mean? I do not know. Perhaps it is the flower of life. It was you who broke it the other day. You threw it there. Why did you pick it up? No reason. I was pleased that you threw it away out of spite. So you enjoy seeing me upset? Why? - I shall not tell you. - Please, do. - For nothing in the world. - I beg you. Cannot you see what is taking place in me? I have trouble speaking. Give me your hand. Here. Something is weighing me down, like a great rock, a heavy object sinking me in deep sorrow. What do you think it is? - Shall I tell you? - Yes. You are in love. Yes. Olga, I love you. You are looking at a crazy man struck by passion. Now, please, I beg you, say it to me. - Say it... - I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. My love... Life... Life, life, life... Life is here, in your eyes and in your smile, in that branch of lilac, in Casta Diva. Everything is here. How are you feeling right now? The same as you. You are indifferent, calm. Indifferent? No. Calm. Why? Because I had foreseen this moment a long time ago. Is that so? Since the day I sang for you. I had called you in my mind. Since that moment? So it is possible? All this is mine? Mine! Mine! Mine! Oh, my Lord, this is the good way to live! Is this a mistake? Yes. Yes, it is a mistake. A mistake, yes. What did I... Ivan Alexeyevich? Ivan Alexeyevich! This is a mistake. That's what it is. Ivan Alexeyevich. A conspiracy. How do I know she loves me? She told you herself. Her heart was ready to accept love. It was awaiting it. I happened to fall in her way, and so did love. If another comes along, she will see her mistake. Another? Who, my dear? As soon as she sees him, she will turn from me. I am stealing what belongs to another. What am I doing? - I am a thief! - What are you saying? I am a thief! No one could love a man like me! Stolz, now, is different. He is clever, strong, and he knows how to rule others. He talks to whomever he wants, and he prevails. He has a way with people and I can't even deal with Zakhar, or with myself. Zakhar! At least talk to her. Zakhar, if Olga Sergeyevna appears tomorrow, say that I am in town. Ilya, she needs an explanation! It is best if I write a letter. Zakhar, paper and pen. I will settle in Petersburg, in the suburb of Vyborg, at your cousin's. - Agaffia Matveyevna? - Yes. I will study, I will read, and then I will go back to Oblomovka alone, without her. My Lord, you have opened my eyes. You have showed me my duty. I must write to her, or she will think I am crazy for making this decision. Write, Ivan Alexeyevich. You will certainly be surprised, Olga Sergeyevna, to receive this letter instead of seeing me in person, but read it through and you will understand there is no other way. We fell in love so suddenly, so swiftly, that it was as if we had fallen ill. I couldn't come to my senses. Only tonight was I finally able to look at the abyss into which I am rushing and decided to stop. I said that I loved you, and you replied with the same words. But cannot you hear the dissonance in our voices? Look at me. Think about my existence. How can you love me? Do you really love me? You keep saying that you love me, but my response is, "You do not". No. No, you do not love me. You do not lie either - it is simply the unconscious need to love, which, in the absence of true nourishment, by lack of fire, burns with a false, heatless flame. "You made a mistake. "He who stands before you "is not the one you expected, the one you dreamed of. "That man shall come one day. "Your mind will be clear. "The spite will oppress you for your mistake, "and your spite will hurt me. "I thus calmly write: we shall no longer be together". My Lord, what have I done? Olga. Olga, are you crying? Leave me. I well know I have no reason to cry. My Lord, what have I done? I must dry those tears away. Speak. I shall do anything. You made them flow. It is not in your power to stop them. It is not. Let me go! That miserable letter. Here. Take it away, or it will make me cry more. In any case, it proves of my care for your happiness. Your care? No, Ilya Ilyich. You must have envied my little happiness, and hastened to disturb it. Did you not read my letter? I renounce you because I see happiness in your future. I am not cold-blooded. I am drowning in sorrow. You wished to see me cry. You take pleasure in seeing me cry! Now, look. Look and rejoice. Nevertheless, Olga, if it were true, if I was right and our love was wrong, if you later blush thinking about me... - So what? - "So what"? You are afraid of succumbing, of hurting if I cease to love you. You say I will be hurt, but I will be fine loving someone else. I will be happy. Do you wish me happiness? Would you sacrifice your life for him? What an idea... Never would I have imagined... The wild happiness, the mornings and evenings together, the strolls... And my words of love - none of that is worth anymore? I could die right now. Olga, I love you. - No. - Yes... You don't love me the way you should love me. You will weary of this love, as you did of books, work and the world. In time, even with no rival, you will fall asleep beside me as on your sofa. Not even my voice will wake you. You will care more about your gown - not even another woman but your own gown - than you do about me. That is impossible. Why is it impossible? You say I will love another man. Well, I say it is you who will cease to love me. And what will happen then? I, too, cannot sleep at night, but I do not agonize over questions about the future, because I hope for the best. Happiness to me is stronger than fear. But you see only doom and gloom. Happiness means nothing to you. That is not love. It is ingratitude. It is... It is selfishness. I poisoned myself. I poisoned you instead of simply being happy. Drink some kvass. It isn't poison. And go back to your sofa. You will make no mistakes. You will not fall into the abyss. That is cruel, now that I have openly condemned myself. You speak of condemnation and abysses, you offer all your life, you become tender to yourself, solicitous. There is nothing left for us to say. Farewell, Ilya Ilyich. Be calm. Isn't calmness your happiness? Olga, no. For the love of God... This lilac... had taken root in my heart. And it hurts. It hurts to rip it out. My pride is being punished. I overestimated my strength. Such was my mistake. I thought I would bring you back to life. I thought I could make you live for me, but I did not foresee this mistake. I was hoping... I can barely stand up. My legs fail me. What I saw could have awakened a stone. But I will no longer move. Not anymore. It is not worth it. You are dead. Aren't you dead, Ilya ? Take me as I am, Olga. Love the good in me. You are gentle... You are honest, Ilya. You are as delicate as a dove. You bury your head under your wing and demand nothing more. Forever you will coo under your roof. But that is not enough for me. I have a need for something else. What exactly? Who knows. If only you could tell me. If only you could tell me what I need and give it to me, so that we... But tenderness can be found anywhere. Forgive me. I don't know what I'm saying. Don't be ashamed to speak the truth. I deserve you to tell me. Why? Why did everything crumble? Who cursed you, Ilya? What did you possibly do? You are a tender, intelligent, noble man, but you are destroyed. What is it that destroyed you? That evil has no name. It does. Oblomovism. Snow... Snow. Snow. It has covered it all. Snow. "This coffee is good. Who made it?" "Ivan Alexeyevich's cousin". "Let us see you". "Would you like some pie?" "Here is as quiet as Oblomovka". "Lovely arms". "You should remarry". "But I have children". "What is this stain?" "This is what Oblomovkans would cook in every celebration". "Happy birthday, Ilya". "Here reigns the peace I dreamed of". "Andrei Ivanovich!" Andrei? So, how are you? Are you doing well? How is your health? I am doing better now, thank you. Are you ill? I had a stroke, Andrei. Good lord! No sequels, I hope? I only have difficulty using my left leg. Ilya, what happened to you? You are at your lowest. This is not funny. We hadn't seen each other in four years. I had the hardest time finding you. But I am on time for dinner. - I am hungry as a wolf! - Take a seat. - Am I interrupting? - You? Not at all. Wait... Ivan Alexeyevich? So, Ilya... You chose never. - Never? - Has time made you forget? "Now or never", remember? But I am not the man that I used to be, Andrei. Now my affairs are in order, praise the Lord. Why didn't you ever come to meet me? I did not go abroad because... Because of Olga? How do you... You know about it? Where is she now? I heard she traveled abroad with her aunt. Shortly after realizing that she had made a mistake. So you do know. I know everything. I even know about the lilac. - How is Olga? - How she is? She is sad. She sheds tears and curses you. What are you saying? We must rush to her side... Calm down. Calm down. She is joyful. She is happy. And she says hello. I advised her not to write to you. It would have caused you grief. How glad I am! Dear Andrei, let me kiss you. A toast to her health. Zakhar! Where is she presently? She lives in her estate. With her aunt? And her husband. She is married? What scares you so much? Memories? No, not at all. I am not scared... I am simply... surprised. I don't know why. Has she been married long? Is she happy? I feel as though you had removed a great burden from my chest. You said she had forgiven me but deep down, something was gnawing at me. My dear Andrei, how grateful I am to you. You have a heart of gold. Your heart was worthy of her. But tell me, who is the fortunate man? Who? Where did your insight go, Ilya? You? Here comes the fear again. What is your... Do not jest, Andrei. Tell me the truth. I am not jesting. I have been married to Olga for over a year. My dear Andrei... My sweet Olga. The Lord has blessed you! How pleased I am! My God! - Tell her... - Oblomov will be Oblomov. No, no. Tell her... remind her that I met her to set her on the right road. I bless this union and I bless her in this new road. Had she set on another one... The guilt has faded away. I have nothing to blush for. Everything is clear now. Dear Lord, I thank You! Zakhar, champagne! Praise the Lord for living this old to hear the good news. All the best, Andrei Ivanovich, my dear sir. May you live a long life and have plenty of babies! I will tell Olga everything. She has indeed reason for never forgetting you. No, no... You were worthy of her. Your heart... is as deep as the sea. What about you? What are you doing here? Well, it is quiet here, Andrei. It is calm. No one to disturb me. Care for some blackcurrant vodka? Taste it. It is delicious. Disturb you from what? My occupations. It is Agaffia Matveyevna who makes it. You see, she is a good woman. What would I do without her? Wait. Wait. It is as if you were in Oblomovka, only in a poorer light. Come with me to the country, Ilya. Are you sure you don't want some vodka? It is reputed. You will not get this from Olga Sergeyevna. She can sing Casta Diva, but never will she make this. And the chicken and mushroom pie... Pies like this were always made in Oblomovka, and now I have them here. Agaffia Matveyevna cooks everything herself. Let us leave together. Olga requests that you join us at her estate, in the countryside. Your love has cooled, you won't be jealous. Come. Andrei, my health is not what it used to be. The styes are back, my legs swell at night... Luckily, Agaffia... Ilya, you must change your lifestyle or you will have another stroke. Dreaming the future is over but choosing a few activities, planning your village, sharing with the farmers to understand their needs, planting, all this you must and you can do it. I will not give up on you. It is not only my own will that drives me, it is also Olga's will, and she refuses that you let yourself die, that you bury yourself alive. I promised her I would get you out of this tomb. - No, Andrei. - Come with me now! It is her wish. She will not forgo it. I may tire, but she will not. She is so ardent, so driven. She can sometimes outpace me. The past will rekindle. You will remember, you will stir... Do not stir anything! It causes me pain, not joy. - What I have here... - What do you have here? Love? You will not live with us, but close to us. It is final. Mercy, let us go! You need to change your life. Hear me? You must. Be quiet, because otherwise, she... "She"? Who? My landlady. She might think I am leaving. - Then let her think so! - No. That is not possible. Listen, Andrei, do no try to convince me. I am staying right here! You are lost. This house, this woman... All this life. Get up. Let us leave. Why? To go where? Far from this pit, far from this swamp, for the world of light and air, for a normal, healthy life. No. What have you become? What have you done? Wake up. Is this is the life you were preparing for? The life of a mole in a burrow? Remember, Ilya. Do not remind me of the past, it is behind. What do you want to make of me? I have forever parted from the world you want to drag me into. And you cannot glue two broken pieces together. I may be rooted to this pit by what harms me, but try to pull me out and I shall die. Do you know who is waiting for you outside? Do you? Let me call her in. Olga. Olga! No! Do not bring her here! Go away! Go away. Go away. Leave, I beg you. I cannot leave this place without you! I promised her. Do you understand, Ilya? When are you coming? Olga will ask me. Andrei, leave me and forget me. I beg you, leave me. What? For ever? For ever. But... Ilya, are you really rejecting me? For her? For that woman? What is she to you? My wife. And the child that you saw is my son. His name is Andrei. After yourself. You are lost. What am I to say to Olga? Never forget my little Andrei. No. I will never forget Andrei. I will lead him where you could not go. It is with him that we will realize our youthful dreams. I tried to wake him up but he refuses. When did I fall asleep? A chicken pie would be nice. Tell us the news, Ivan Alexeyevich. All has been said, Ilya. There is nothing more to tell. Nothing more? How so? You go into society, don't you? You read book as well, I believe. Yes. I do read at times. Or other people read and talk, and I listen. Yesterday, Alexei Spiridonych's college son read out loud. What did he read? A paper on the British, I believe. They have delivered rifles. Alexei Spiridonych said there would be war. Who did they deliver them to? Spain. Or India. I cannot remember. The ambassador was quite displeased. Which ambassador? I don't know. Against whom will the war be? The pasha of Turkey, I think. What else is new in the political world? It is being said that the Earth is growing colder. It will soon freeze altogether. Away! Is that politics? Dmitri Alexeych started by reading politics, then he read the rest. He did not say that politics was over. He had already moved on to literature. What did he read on literature? That the best writers are Karamzin, Batyushkov, Dmitriev and Zhukovsky. And Pushkin. Subtitles: ECLAIR
