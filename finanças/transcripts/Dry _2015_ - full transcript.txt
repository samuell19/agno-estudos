- I still remember my days in Aberystwyth. Many many years ago I graduated from the oldest university in Wales and home to the oldest school of international politics in the world. I'm really glad that Aberystwyth is able to host this grand award ceremony today... But of course, you might say as a politician, I would naturally endorse my alma mater that might be true, but for me, I will always support what is right and good. Thank you very much. - Okay, and now for our final recipient. This lady, this amazing lady has selflessly served our community. She's one of our leading specialists here in the hospital. She's worked tirelessly to raise funds for children's cancer research and treatment but in addition to that, she's provided support for teenage pregnancies and many of our local families have benefited directly from her work, and let's face it, who can forget how she led us on that London marathon? Yeah, that was so much fun. Okay, we must recognize the brilliant work of this amazing lady. Please welcome Dr. Zara from St. Luke's Hospital. - Thank you so much, thank you, thank you. Wow. Wow, it's amazing. I am so honored to be receiving this award, really. Because I remember relocating from Los Angeles five years ago with my mom to this amazing town and my friends thought I was going to the end of the world and truly the train line literarily terminates here, I must say, but I've got say, it's been one of the best decisions of my life, and I would like to dedicate this award it to all the amazing kids we've worked with over the years and to their families for making our job so much easier. And to all the medical doctors from St. Luke's, seated in the audience today, who have also worked with me on these projects. I want to say thank you and God bless. Thank you. More drinks, Alex! - Okay, here we go again. To the smartest doctor. - I'm so sorry, but it's not safe for you to go home. You need to stay here. - Good morning Mrs. Jones? Okay, so take a deep breath, good? We just want to keep you under observation, for a few more days, run some test and if you're good, we'll send you home. Is that okay? All right, so nurse, take her back to the ward. - Doctor Zara, a woman in labor was just rushed into the emergency room. - Oh, really? How long has she been there? - Not that long. - Okay. - We are here for your daughter, What is your... - I'm listening, I'm listening. - Yeah, what is the problem that you're dragging your feet about? - Alhaji, I am not dragging my feet, most especially now that Halima is 13 years old. I know she is big enough to be in her husband's house but you people have to exercise a little more patience for me-- - Ibrahim, have you changed your mind? Are you not giving me your daughter in marriage again? - I have not change my mind, Sani, but you know there are necessary things that Halima needs to go to her husband's house with, those are the things I am trying to fix. - Fix the date, I will take care of all the expenses. Halima. Ma! - What did Mama Adamu say? - She said... - Mr. Bird now came to the ground and say, "Mrs. Tortoise, "your husband say you put all the hard things "in the house, that he's going to fall on them, oh!" So she did, the tortoise now come to the ground. That is how the tortoise broke his back. - Halima, what are you doing here all alone? Why are you not with your brother and sister? You should come in and rest. You know next week is your big day. - Ma, I don't want to marry now. - Halima, you are too young to understand these things. You are young and this is the right time. When you are old and worn out, who will marry you? And Sani has been so generous. See all the gifts he showers on the us every now and then? It seems he's the right one for you. - Why me? I don't want go with him. - Halima, your father wants the best for you. Since you're the eldest, he wants you to get married first, before your younger one, Tani. She has been betrothed over a year now. She is waiting for you to get married so hers can come next. Can't you see how excited she is? - Mother, please. - Halima, you are very young and healthy and very soon you will become a mother. See my Halima, getting married to a very rich man! Your friends and their mother will be so jealous of you! - It's been three months since our last session. - Is it already three months? - Yes, where have you been? - I had to take care of my mom. - What happened to your mother? - She's been suffering from exhaustion from her last trip and now I can't believe she's planning another trip to Africa. - You know that's what keeps her going? - Yes, but she's been doing it for years. Traveling every year for her medical missions. - One of those missions saved you. - I know. Maybe I just miss when it was just the two of us. - You feel she's not proud of you anymore? - No, she is. - Do you think you might go with her on one of her trips someday? - I don't know. - Why don't you go? - Because told you before my life is here. - When do we break this wall? - What wall? - Your fears? - I don't have any fears. - We have been going around in circles each session. When do you let me in? - Maybe I need to trust completely. - You don't trust me? - I, it-- I'm sorry. Hospital. I have to leave now. - Your next appointment is on Thursday. - Okay, thank you. - Thousands of women are dying in Africa due to the lack of medical care and this is a serious gynecological problem. It was reported that more than two million women in the world suffer from a condition called fistula and one would have thought in this 21st century, that cases of fistula should not exist. - You asked to see me? - Oh yeah, have a seat. I have an interesting proposition for you. - It's not about going back to Sierra Leone, is it? - Oh, come on, I thought you liked it. - I do, I do, but I got back home two weeks ago and Jamie was walking, you know little toddler steps, and I missed it. I need a break. - How old is Jamie? - He's 14 months. Why don't you ask Zara? Sound like the Pharmco guys gave a good presentation. - Oh boy, did they ever, and we can't possibly miss out on the funds they can make available to us. - You should really ask Zara. She does so much charity work here. It's almost as if she's trying to make up for something. - Yeah. It's funny, you know, she gives her hundred percent, but when you bring up Africa, she shies away from it. I don't know, beats me. - Well, the fact that I'm from there doesn't necessarily mean that I know it more than anyone here. - Okay Zara, Pharmco Pharmaceutical is investing over sixty percent in our community hospital fund. It's only fair that we reciprocate. Don't you want to be a part of the team? - I'm already part of the team! I don't need to go to Africa with a company whose only interest is in making profit all in the name of charity, and I don't need to prove anything to anyone. - I want you to think about this. - How was your meeting with Dr. Brown? - He wants me to go to Africa with Pharmco Pharmaceutical. Can you imagine that? - That sounds great! - Great? - Yeah. Maybe we could go together. - I don't even want to talk about that. I'm not going there. - Why? What's wrong with that? - Come on Alex, Dr. Brown just wants to look good in front of the board. That's Dr. Brown. You know? - I wonder why he hasn't ask me? - Maybe you should got ask him also. I told him to, you know... Just sit tight for a couple of minutes. It's nearly ready. - Yeah, I told him to ask doctor... All right, it'll be just two more minutes, nearly there. - Um... Uh, Mom? Yeah? Um, yes, are you okay? Yes, you want me to come? Okay, I'll be there now. Alex, my mom, I need to go to my mom now. I need to leave. - What? Zara? - Hi darling. - He's gotten a ring - Who? - Alex! - Oh, show me! - Well, I freaked out and I left. - So he didn't ask you? - Well he was about to. The whole candle lit dinner, the whole atmosphere. I just freaked out. I'm not ready. - Come here. It's natural to be afraid. But Alex is a good man. - I know. Maybe I'm not just good enough. - Look, I've always told you, don't judge yourself so harshly. You are beautiful, successful, you're one of the best doctors in the town. Why on earth would you think you're not good enough? - I don't know. Maybe I've gotten nervous. Are you still planning your trip to Africa? - Yes, I am. Are you going to come with me this time? It will be fun. - Mom, I've told you, I'm needed here. - Wow, great! She's almost due for delivery. - We are really looking forward to it. We're so excited. - Um, however, from what I'm seeing here, her pelvic is too narrow for a natural birth, so she might need to deliver through Caesarean section. - No, no, no, no, no, we expected natural birth. - I know, we have to consider the risk. I mean, Caesarean section is not-- - No, no, no, we have read lots of self help books on natural birth and we are convinced it's right for us. - Are you her husband? - She is my fiancee. - What do you think? I mean, it's your body. I'm here to lay down all the medical facts for you to help you make a decision. - Em, well, I would prefer a natural birth. - I know, we are not in anyway discouraging natural birth. I mean it's the best way, but if we sense any kind of possible complications, you know, we take precaution so that mother and child are not at risk. - Now don't try to scare us. We want natural birth, doctor, and that's what we've decided on. - I couldn't believe those two, acting as if I suggested the worst option to them. - We advise and the patients decides. - Well they're even lucky to have a choice. Some people don't. I didn't have a choice. It was very painful. - What was painful? - Leaving her or the thought of not knowing. - Do you have any regrets? - I can't let go of the pain, of the shame. - Why do you come here every Thursday? - I don't know. I guess I'm supposed to be talking to a shrink. - Are you willing to look inside yourself and heal? - Welcome, yes. - I need more. - How is my beautiful daughter doing? - We are almost done. My magic fingers are giving her the best make-over this town has ever experienced. Look at her, like a princess! Even the old Sani will not recognize her. - Ah, Dillaliya, Sani is a nice one, and I know he's going to take good care of my Halima. - Oh, I'm sure, his other wives seem to be doing okay. Though I heard his mother is a handful, giving his wives so much trouble. - Dillaliya, his mother is a good woman, and I know she's going to be fine with them. - Oh please, ignore the way I'm talking. It's just everyone seems to think I have a big mouth, but Halima is so beautiful-- - I think your job is done, right, Dillaliya? - Yes, yes. - My daughter, all your friends are going to be jealous of you because you're marrying a rich husband. And even those who cannot find husbands for their own daughters. Cheer up, my dear. Cheer up. Hadiza! - Now here is the dowry. - It is complete, may God bless this marriage. - Ah, doctor, I can't take it anymore! - I don't want you to push unless I tell you to. I want you to save all your energy, okay? - Shut up! Doctor, I can't take it anymore. - I'm here, baby. - Don't call me baby! Take him out, take him out, take him out! - Please, I need you to leave now. Let's move her now to the theater, please. - Cut me open, I don't care. Get it out of me! Thank you doctor, I'm really grateful. - No problem. - And uh, I'm so sorry, doctor. I'm glad you did the operation. - It's all right, there's no problem. The most important thing is that mother and child are safe. How're you feeling? - A bit tired, but I'm okay. - Oh, Mom. - Oh, hi darling. - Hi. - I didn't want to leave without seeing you. - I didn't know you were coming in today. - My trip has been moved forward, so I needed to do my final check ups. - Oh, okay. - Are you okay, darling? - I'm fine. When are you leaving? - In a week. - Okay, I-- The test results. - Oh, thanks. Here's your results, Mama. Okay, mom, you are good to go. Clean and healthy. - I need to be on my way. - I was exactly like you when I married my first husband. That was before he died. Poor man, he had a fragile heart! But after then, I married my second husband, which is Sani's father, Sani, your husband, eh? Sani's father loved me. He could not get his hands off me, but after a while he too died, he too had a fragile heart. But don't worry. You see, I like you. You are very strong. Look at your bones, you'll give me a lot of grand children. Hm? - You stubborn boy. What is wrong with you, what is wrong with you? What is wrong with you? - Hey, woman, stop beating him! - Halimagida, this boy is very stubborn! - Is okay, is okay. Go, go, go to your brothers. Hey, hey, afternoon. Where's my mother? - She's over there. - What about my new wife, Halima? Where is she? - She's equally there, she's with Hajia. - Ah! Halima! Halima! Ah, good afternoon, Ma! Halima! - I was just having a little discussion with your new wife. What a beautiful addition she is. - Halima, my wife, how are you? Let's go in, let's go in, my wife. Halima, my wife. My pretty one, this is for you, as my new wife. I want you to always look nice and beautiful for me, hm? You are welcome. - Is there something you need to talk to me about? - No, why? - Just wondering. - I'm just remembering my dad. And I miss him so much. - You know, I'm here for you. - Yeah, I know. - Halima. My pretty one. You know you are mine now, eh? Don't do that. Come close to your husband. Come! - Don't hurt me. - Hey, shh! I'm not going to hurt you. Come, come, come to me! Hey, hey, hey-- Listen, listen to me! Listen! Keep quiet, shut up! I paid a lot of money to have you as my wife! I waited for you all these years, but still you want to struggle with me. Stop it, stop it, I said! Did your mother not prepare you for the role of a wife? Do not be stubborn with me, you hear me? When I come here next time, I expect complete submission! Halima! - I think this one is okay. - Eh. - Halima. What is wrong with you? Why haven't you bothered to join the rest of us to do some cleaning? Why are you locked up in here? Come, let me clean you up. - He beats me, all my body is paining me. I don't want to see him again. - Sorry, he didn't beat you. I'm sure that's his own way to show you how much he loves you. - I don't want to see him again. I don't want to see him again. - It's okay, Halima. You are young, but you will understand soon enough. - Stop, uncle, please. No, no! Uncle stop, uncle stop. - Thank you so much. - That's him, right? - Alex! What are you doing here? - You're cheating on me with him? - Have you been following me and what are you talking about? - I'm talking about you sneaking out every Thursday to see another man. I trusted you, Zara. - No, I trusted you not to invade my privacy. - Your privacy? Are we private now? - Listen Alex, I'm not going to take this crap from you or any man. I need to sort myself out. - Oh, so that's what you are doing, sorting yourself out? - You're damn right, that's what I'm doing, sorting myself out. What is this? You sneaking up on me? I mean, that is so creepy. I'm done - Zara come back here. Zara, I'm talking to you! - Where are you coming from? Is everything all right? - He beats me. My whole body is paining me. - Halima! He is your husband. He can do anything. - Halima, have you come to visit us? How is... You're crying? What happened? - He beats me. - He beats you? How can he beat you? He's your husband, Halima. By the way, what did you do to provoke him? - Nothing. - Now go back to your husband's house and learn to love him. - At this hour? It's late. - It's late? Go back to your husband house and make his home your home. - Please, no. Halima, don't worry. I will take you home tomorrow, yeah? Let's go. My in-law, I have brought her. - She ran away? - Um, yes... No, she's-- - I understand, I understand. No problem at all, no problem. Greet your husband for me. Where did you go to? I'm asking you, where did you go to? - Zara's not speaking to me. - Why? - I don't know. - Zara goes in and out of her moods. She'll come around. - I hope so. She's... She's seeing a shrink. - It's nothing unusual these days. - No, I mean she's dating one. - Are you sure? - No, I don't know. I'm confused. - Well, you've been together a long time, and I know she loves you. I don't think Zara would do such a thing like that. - I'm afraid she might have broken up with me. - Why do you think that? - We had an argument. I've never seen her so angry. - Oh, Alex. Don't worry, I'll talk to her. - Alex is gone. You two really-- - Why didn't you tell me? - Because there was nothing definite. I tried to, but you were too scared to hear me out. - Are you sure she's really alive? - Like you, I had my doubts, but what I found is very hopeful. The nurse confessed, but I don't know anything yet. On my last trip I was able to get the address of Madam Kojo, and I'm hoping to get more information on this trip. - Oh, god Mom, what do I do? - All these years I have watched you grow into a wonderful, successful doctor and daughter. And all of these years, I have watched you suffering silently. So I think maybe if you could find out if your child is alive or dead, then you can put an end to your suffering. - Mom, I don't want to go back there, I don't want to go back there. - Oh, I know. - I just can't. - That's why I'm doing the job for you. He's one of the most important men in your country now. Listen you have to go. - I can't, I can't do this, Mom, I just can't do this. - You have to. - I can't do this. - You must, you must. - Mom, your hands are cold. Mom, Mom? Mom! You okay, Mom? Mom? - We've manage to stabilize her, but we're gonna have to keep her under observation for next couple of weeks. - For a week? - Yes. - Oh my gosh, she going to be so devastated. She's suppose to be on her medical tour to Africa. - She would never make it. She's dehydrated, exhausted and her heart's in no condition to be under any strenuous activities. She will be fine, though. - I know. Thanks. - Dr. Zara, I will look after your mother. - Thank you so much. - Oh, hi darling. - How are you going? - What day is it? - Saturday. - But my trip. - It's been canceled. - We can't disappoint those women. They are depending on me. We have over 1,000 women waiting to be treated. - I know Mom, but right now we're really more concerned about your health and you should. Relax, okay? How are you feeling? You still have the headache? And your back? I need you to relax, okay? The doctor's gonna take care of you, okay? Just relax, all right, Mom, 'kay? Alex, it took my a lot to write this letter and I'm sorry to leave the country without seeing you. I know I have been acting weird lately and... But there are just some things in my past that I need to confront, some truth that I need to know. You have been amazing and I cannot ask for anyone better, but for us to move forward in our relationship, I need to sort some things out, you know? Like I said to you. I'm going back home and I just hope everything goes as I planned. Be patient with me. I will always love you. Thank you so much for picking me up. - It's my pleasure. When your mother told me that her daughter was coming to help, I was overjoyed. She's told me so much about you, that I've actually been looking forward to meeting with you. - Well, we finally meet. She has also said good things about you too. - Oh, thank you. And thanks for coming to come help in our small hospital. Your mother has been of such great help all these years. - Well, I just pray that I will be able to help the little that I can before she comes on her next trip, because I know she would. I'm sure you would. But first I will take you to your hotel. - Okay. - And then tomorrow I'll come pick you to the hospital. - Your mother told me that you're pregnant. Congratulations. Your husband did not waste at all. Don't mind me. I hope there's no problem and that your mother in-law is not giving you too much problems? What about the small, small witches? Your husband's wives? - No. - If you need anything there, don't hesitate. Just come and ask me, eh? - Okay. Thank you. - Be walking gently, eh? Okay. - Take care of yourself. - Look at my daughter! Isn't she beautiful? - She's beautiful. - She'll give me a grandchild one of these days, very soon. She has proven that she is the true daughter of her mother. Hello, how are you? Halima, what took you so long? - I saw my mother's friend Dillaliya. - Dillaliya? Dillaliya? That village gossip! I can't wait to deal with that woman one of these days. We don't want that kind of association in this family. Huh, Dillaliya? Matron, good morning! - How are you? Very good. - So that's the nurses' station, and here we have the-- - Good morning, matron. What are we going to do with this case? - Which one is this? - The one with the failing surgery. - Oh, Dr. Zara, Mrs. Robin's daughter. She'll be spending a few weeks with us. - Oh, she's the one? It's a pleasure to have you here. - It's a pleasure to be here. - You're welcomed. - Thank you. - Have you talked to Dr. Londi about this case? - He's on leave. - Since when? Over a week now. - Who authorize it? - Don't know. - Not a worry, I'll handle this. - Everything okay? - Much as I hate to admit it, we'll definitely be needing your help here. - Oh, how many surgeries do you carry out in a day? - One. If we're lucky, maybe two. These are trying times. It used to be like 10 a day, but with no more support, everyone just keep silent about the condition. - There are lots of women here. - Every time I see them my heart bleeds. But we are looking for more preventives ways to keep them out of this condition. - Can I see the file on the girl? - Oh yeah, and that's the girl. - Oh. - I can't understand why her surgeries keep failing. - Well, I can see here that the hole on her bladder has been closed, but the bladder function has still not been restored, and I think we have to start by doing a urodynamics examination on her. What more can we do to stop this? - We have been battling with this condition now for the past 10 years now. Yet they still fall victim. They still believe in early marriages, female circumcision, and giving birth at home. - Let me handle this case. - You were meant to observe today. - I have seen enough from a distance, I can tell you. Where do all these women come from? - From all over the country. It's no longer the thing of the north. We have so many woman out there who don't even believe they can still be cured. - I need to do one more operation on her. Prepare her. - Fatima! Fatima! She's not here? - No she's not. - I think you should go and find this woman by yourself. - I don't know her house Hajia. - Where's Sani? Let him to go and look for her. I should call Sani. - Let them go and look for her! - Hajia, he's here Why don't you go and find the birth attendant now? - Ma, I don't know, I don't know. I don't know where she is. I said you should go to Adamu's compound, ask them they will tell show you where she is. - Okay. - Sorry, I'm sorry. - I still feel we should take her to the hospital. - No, Hajia, no worries, I already check her. Her tummy worries, when her tummy rests she will deliver. - Why don't you give her at least something? - Okay, give her this-- - She's carrying my grandchild. - Give her this one. - I don't trust this, I think we should take Halima to the hospital-- Let's go to the hospital! - Alhaji, have you seen my shop? Alhaji just look at my babes and make your pick. - Who is she? - Wow, she's new in the business. - I think I like to go with this one, I can go for her. - Okay, I'll deliver her to you. Be the first to taste her. - Hey! Madam Kojo! - She bit your ears? You think you can ruin my business? You little rat, you almost made me lose a valuable customer. Take her away and do to her what we do to disobedient servants. You can do anything. Stupid girl, make her suffer. - Good afternoon. - Um, I'm looking for Madam Kojo. - Madam Kojo? - Well, where can I find her? - I don't know. - Ragamu, where is, where is it? - Look around here, ask the people around this area, they will tell you. - But she used to live here before. - He said when we get to Ragamu, we should ask of her. Do you know how to get there or I should I just call someone else? - Ragamu? - Yes. - That's quite far away from town. I didn't know the new doctor is a local. - No I was just talking to the driver to see if he can get me there. - Oh, okay. Well, Dr. Londi. - Oh, Dr. Zara. - Oh? - Oh, yes, I was actually looking forward to meeting you. I heard you were on leave. - As you can see obviously I'm back to the same struggle. I could drive you down there. I mean, I mean to Ragamu. - Oh, no, don't worry, doc, the driver will take me. - All right, you're welcomed. I hope you don't crash and burn under the pressure. - I hope not too. - Okay, I heard you fixed the girl. Her case has been quite challenging. - Well, I'm happy that I could be of help. - Modest, I would say for a doctor of your caliber. Well, um, they will keep coming with the same cases over and over again, so roll up your sleeves. Nice to meet you. - Same here. - Well, hope you enjoy it. - I hope so. - Your mom always do, whenever she comes around. - Halima, come, come, come, come. What's wrong with you, huh? Why you wet? Why you dripping? Let me check you. This is serious. - Matron, Nurse Ramatu just told me that Dr. Londi wants to quit? - He's not the first one to do that. - Why? - Doctor, there is no money in treating fistula patients. It's a job of passion, no financial reward. We pick them up after medical school, train them as fistula surgeons, the next thing, they want to move to the teaching hospitals. - How have you been coping all these years? - God. In my many years on this job, your mother knows about it all. I just believe that when we take pity on the poor, poor in health, we lend to God. - But is there no way they get their payment directly from the government? - Oh yes, we have sent a proposal to the ministry of health, we told them, "Pay them and retain them here "as fistula surgeons." We can only train because we have to, but we can't force them to stay. - Dr. Londi, think about it. - Think about what, Zara? I can't do this anymore. I've got a wife, I've got one, two, three kids, I've got aged parents, I've got cousins, siblings all staying in my place, waiting for manna to fall from heaven, and you know? I am the provider of that manna. Don't you understand? - But you save the little you can. You are a medical doctor, your duty is to save lives. - But guess what, I did not sign a vow of poverty. There are so many opportunities out there and I'm going in search of one, please. Now listen, it's rather depressing going home in this gear everyday and with the smell. I've made up my mind. You're not going to get Londi this time, honestly. I'm gone, Londi, you're gone, Londi, you gone. - What are you doing here? - Halima, come here, come. Come here. Sit. Halima, do not let them get to you, okay? - I don't know what is wrong with me. - Nothing is wrong with you, my dear, nothing. - Oh please! Why you lie to her? She obviously some kind of abomination to have this kind of disease. - Isn't that the same thing that happened to Ayesha? They said she committed adultery. - Mariam, keep quiet! You both should be ashamed of yourselves. This poor girl have just lost her baby recently. Where is your conscience, you two? Where is your conscience? Come, let me clean you up, okay? Don't worry, you'll be okay. - Open the door for me. - All right. Halimagida, you're here. - Can I come in? - Welcome. - Thank you. - Hello. (Screaming - Push, push! - Madam Kojo. Do you remember me? It's Zara. Where's my child? Where is my baby? Mom, she couldn't tell me anything. It looks like I will never know what happened to her. I don't even know why I came here in the first place. Mom, I just need to find her, that's all I want is to find her. Zara. - Yes? You're in Africa. Get closure on this so you can move on with your life. - The whole village is talking about Halima and this dreaded disease she has brought to our household. - I don't know what to do. - You don't know what to do? Hey, son, you don't know what to do? Well if you don't know what to do, I do. I will arrange to send her to the buka's house. Because I even suspect that this is an evil attack or even witchcraft, Sani. - Hajia! - Can you imagine the amount the money that we spent on that girl and her family only for them to turn around and make us a laughing stock in this village? Don't forget, Sani, the possibility that she may have even committed adultery. - I disvirgined the girl. And she has remained in the confines of this home since I married her. - What about that time that she ran away? What about when she ran away and we couldn't find her until her mother brought her? Do you know if she went in search of her old boyfriends? And then the other time, do you remember? When I sent her to call Adamu's mother for me, she went away and never came back, when she got here, she said she's got lost. Got lost, Sani, in this tiny village, where the even cockroaches can find their way to the stream. Don't be naive, Sani. Don't be naive! - They are saying our whole household is infected with disease, Halimagida - Everyone smell, you know? And people should stop coming to our house. We are just coming from Kiki's place. It's Fatima. Fatima! - What is it, Mariam? You people should leave the poor girl alone. - Have I not warned you before, have I not told not to take her out? - But mama, she has to go out. - Hey, it's enough! Halima, we will have put you in a room where you stay for a while before I decide on what to do with you. No going out and no cooking. - What is the emergency? - All the doctors have resigned. - What? - As soon as Dr. Londi left, they all got discouraged. Right now we have a back log of women waiting for repairs and we are short of medical supplies. - What are we going to do? I mean, who is going to pay for their surgeries? - People in the rural area cannot even afford to pay for the first procedures in the surgery. - Can't leave them here. Who is the current Minister of Health? - Miss Zara Robbins. I am quite touched by your zeal on fistula. This is the ministry of health and we do supervise every kind of medical condition We've been working on Fistula for years. But we have some budget constraints at the moment. I will suggest you try the office of the MDGs. Maybe they can help you for now. - What do we do, Dillaliya? - Didn't I say it? I knew that Sani's mother is a witch. Look at what has befallen our pretty Halima in the hands of that wicked family. - Dillaliya? Solution please. - Who told you to take her out of this compound? Is it not enough that the whole village is talking about this dreaded disease that she brought upon our family? You had to go and parade her around, round the whole village? - Mama, We just went to the market to pick up some fish. You know she hasn't left this house since. - What do you mean, she has not left the house since? Since she brought this disease unto our family, do you know the kind of disgrace that my son has received? Young lady, this is not the time to cry, let me tell you. Do you understand that? You stay in your room until we decide what to do with you. - We will wait for our husband to tell us what to do. - Fatima! Your husband! Let me remind you in case you have forgotten, that he is my son and I make the decision here in his absence. So you don't stand there and tell me anything about anything. Now, you go to your room and go and do your cooking and while you are at it Fatima, clean her up before the whole house starts smelling. - Go back to your father. Go and let your family share in this embarrassment. Why should I be the only one to suffer? What did I do wrong? I waited for you, bought gifts for your family, married you the right way. What was my crime? Please go! Whatever your sins are, I will not suffer along with you. - Husband, please. - Who is your husband? You are the one who knows who you slept with that gave you this terrible disease. - Halimagida, please I beg you. I didn't sleep with anyone. Please don't chase me away. My parents won't receive me. - Why won't they reject you, you witch? I don't know what made me waste my money on you. The whole house smells. My friends can no longer come and pay me a visit, and to worsen it you can't bear children anymore. Who will want to sleep with a rotten pig like you? Who? Hey, listen to me! - What happened, huh? Halima! - Excuse me! If I see you near her, you'll pack your things to your father's house. - Please, please, she's just a little girl, Hajia, please, please! - Hajia please. - Hajia, please, see the little girl in front to you. Please beg out husband. - Please. - Come on. Don't worry, it's going to be okay. - Please Halimagida, please. She's our daughter, where will she go? She's not a witch, please don't listen to them. - Please. - She has to go. - Where will she go? There's nowhere to go. - My hands are tied, there is nothing I can do. - She needs us now, she needs us. - Please. - Please. What kind of a man are you? - Halima, Halima. - I wish I would die. The dead are better than me. - Don't say that, my daughter. There must be a solution. I brought food for you. Eat. - I heard there's a new doctor in town who can cure your disease. I came with some clothes and food for you. I'll come and pick you up tomorrow evening, okay? I'll take you there. - Fatima, where are you coming from? Sit down, you went to Usuman's house. Why did you have to stay that long? - Um, when I was coming, uh-- - Anyway, just sit down, join us. We are having a family discussion. As I was saying, everyone in the village is now thinking that there is something wrong with this family, but thank God that Halima is out of here. So, the best thing to do now is to marry another wife since I have divorced her. We need to cleanse this home and restore my dignity. - Our husband, we need to be careful this time around. I mean, why'd you rush? I think we should recover from this Halima issue first. - Halimagida, Mariam is right. And also we are here to take very good care of you. You don't know what another wife might bring. We have been living in peace for a while now. Please, mai gida, don't invite anymore evil into our midst. - Let me make this clearer. He is not asking for your opinion on this matter. He is only sharing his intentions with you. His very good intentions. - Halimagida, as for me, since you have made up your mind, I don't have anything to say. - You are a witch, you are a witch, you are a witch! You need to see the condition of-- - Doctor Mutanga! - What is it again? - We have another case, so. - Another case? Another case. - How? Because of this disease you carry,. - I have told you, don't drop that woman. Don't drop that woman there! I thought this was supposed to be a hospital! Either you serve life, or to kill. - Don't drop that woman! Come, come back here! Come back here! Come back, I can't carry this one! - Please we are here to see the doctor. My friend needs help. - Fill this form. - We can't read or write. - Well, sit down there. When Ike comes, he will help you fill it. - I know. - Oh, man, fu... - Dr. Mutanga! - No, no, go and, go and put on the generator. I am operating here now. - Why didn't anybody tell me? We used the last one this month. - Okay, nurse give him some money, eh? And you, just hurry up and put on the generator. I'm seriously doing something here. - Dr. Mutanga, I no get any money. - My friend give him the money. What's your problem? And I warned you people, no speaking Pidgin English in this place. - Ah! - I don't know how to handle her case, honestly. I don't know where to start from. See, where is the pen? - Doctor, it's on your head. - Oh, sorry. See, the only kind of cases we handle here are child birth, you know, appendix, malaria, two plus or three plus, typhoid, eczema, meningitis, all this. But this case, I don't even have the kind of equipment to perform that kind of surgery. - But doctor, they told us that you are very good. - I'm very good, honestly. But I'm sorry, I cannot help your friend. Nurse! - Thank you so much, and we are very grateful for, you know, assisting us in such a short notice. - Anytime. Are you still doing the mobile clinic in the rural villages? - Oh, yes, I and some doctors are going round the villages to operate on these women, and since they can't come to us, we have go to them. - Of course, of course, that's the best strategy. I'll be on my way now, but remember, we're always there to help. - Thank you, thank you very much. Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Ayesha! How are you doing? Look at you, looking all fine and pretty. - Thank you. - You're going to be discharged next week. - I know, Matron told me. I hear you're going to the villages? - Mhm, next week, in a few weeks, actually. - Doctor, please can you start with mine? I know this girl that has this condition and she has been abandoned by her husband and family. I would like you to help her. I can take you around the villages. - I doubt if you're strong enough to do that. - Doctor, please. Let me go with your team. I understand the language and can assist in any way. - Okay, I will think about it, but right now I need you to go to your bed and rest, okay? - Okay. - I'll let you know. - Help! Somebody help me! - What happened to her? - She has been in labor for days now. - How many days? - Four days. - Four days? Oh, she's bleeding. More gauze, more gauze, more gauze. More gauze. No! Wake up! God. - I heard what happened. - If only they had brought her early enough! If only they had brought her here on time! - This happens while we are still trying to save many. We can't save every life. - But I could have saved this one. Why do they bring her here when they allow her to give birth at home? What is the point? Her records show she attended antenatal care here, but when she's about to give birth, she's locked up with some quacks! And then she's about to die, they remember there's a freaking clinic around the corner! What's wrong with all these people? - These people do not know any better. Hey, you don't have to be so hard on yourself. We can't entirely comprehend it. It's hard enough that they allow little babies to give birth to babies with no professional help whatsoever. We don't have all the answers, but we are doing all we can. - No! We need to do more. We can't keep losing these women. I mean there has to be way! If they can't come to us, we will go to them. Yesterday Honorable Musa received an award of excellence from the Speaker of the House for his contribution. Honorable Musa said he was very elated to receive the award, and that he will-- - He's one of the few I like. - Okay. - Some of the doctors have indicated their interest. - Oh, that's wonderful, that's great. So that means we can start with the nearest village. - That's right. - Do you want some tea? - Oh no, I'm just fine, thank you. - Okay. - So if you know anybody that has VVF, anybody that has fistula, our bus is set up in that place, tell the person to come so we can repair them. Go, go, go! - What is going on, Ayesha? - It's the girl I told you about. - Why are they stoning her? I don't understand. - I don't know. Please do something! - Matron! Did you see what is going on? - Yes, I've seen it all. - They can't just stone her like that, are they crazy? Come on, come on, come here, come back! Doctor Zara, come back. No, no, no, let's go, let's go. Not now. Get into the car. - They can't just do that. Listen, just get into the car now, please! Please! - Take your food. What more do you want me to do for you, huh? Tell me, what do you want? - I want my childhood back. I want to be a girl again, playing in my father's compound with the other children. Laughing, clapping, staying by my mother, helping out in the kitchen, listening to folklore under the moon. Can you get that for me? Can you? - Halima. - Did you hear what happened to me in the market? - Yes, I heard what happened to you in the market, Halima, but you have to be strong. Stop crying. Have to believe things will work out themselves somehow. - Yes, what do you want? - Please, what is wrong with her? - What's your problem in what is wrong with her? Are you her for gossip or you want to hear it from my mouth? - I'm only here to help. - Which help, which help? Didn't you hear what happened to her at the village? - I saw what happened today. I came with the medical team. - We went to the hospital. They could not help, so leave us alone. - Please don't talk like that. I understand what you are going through. I went through the same thing too, but now I'm dry. - Just go, go, I don't want to go anywhere. Go, go! Go! - Halima, Halima. - I know you know where she is. You don't know the guilt I carried with me all these years. I just want to know that she is happy, or if she's in a good home, or? Just anything. I beg you, tell me something, just tell me just anything. I beg you. - She was struck with stroke a few years back, but she's recovering. She speaks like, once in a while. - Who are you? - My name is Rita and I'm her daughter. - Well, I just want to know what she did with my child. - She told me about her. She said it was the biggest regrets of her life. - I don't care about that. I'm sorry your mother was such a horrible person. All I need to know is to find my baby. I want to know where my child is. That's all I want to know. - Um. There's a woman in Kuma village, her name is Hadiza, but I don't know if she still lives there. - Just give me any information, anything, I can find her. - I don't know much. I'm so sorry, but be rest assured, if I find something, I'll definitely contact you. - Hello? Hello? Hello? Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. - Please sir, we are looking for Hadiza. - Is everything all right? - Yes, no problem, but is this her house? - Yes, this is her house. I'm her husband but she has gone to the market. Is anything the matter, please? - No, no, no, no, we are just very close friends of hers and we came to visit her. - Oh. You are welcome, yes, yes, just a minute. Come and have a sit. Come and sit here and wait for her. - Okay. As well. You are welcome. Welcome, welcome, welcome. - I don't know what you're talking about. She's my daughter! - She is mine, she was stolen from me. - Get out, get out! - Listen Hadiza, this is the mother. - You have no right to come in here. - Please, I beg you, I don't want to lose her a second time. I just need to see her face. I just want to make sure that she's fine. That's all I ask, please. - Leave my house before I do something drastic. Leave! - I know it's difficult for you, but please-- - Leave my house! Get out! Get out! - Get up! Now leave the house. Leave the house. I said leave my house! - I'm on my way to the hospital, my dear. That doctor, their operation, they were operating women, operating women, operating women, that's what they've been saying, Even at the village square, she said that, she was telling them, I heard. She was telling them, you know me I don't say what I don't see. She was telling them that operation, hospital, pregnant hospital, everything hospital. - Oh my god. - The whole thing is burned down! - Who could have been responsible for this? - I don't know! - I told you, Dr. Zara, these people can be crazy. Come on, come on, come on. Doctor Zara. - Where are all the people? - We have to look for them, we have to look for all of them. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. - Why is our children burning our hospital down? The only community hospital, and these people have come to help us. Our children are doing it. Do you know of it? It is not us. - Why is it not you, is your children who are doing it. You better go and warn them. This will not happen again. - Who's next? - Oh, she's next, she's ready now. - Oh, how are we doing? - I learnt that some new doctors came into the village. - Are you sure they can help her? You said the other doctor rejected her. - They rejected her, but this one is different, because Amina, Rabu's daughter just got well. My prayer now is that Halima agrees to go with me. - Let's go and talk to her, let's go. Halima! Halima, Halima, Halima! - Halima! - Please, go and get the doctor! Please, please. Oh my god, Halima. - Help! Help, help! Hospital, hospital please, help Halima! Halima, please! Help, help, please, help! - Halima, Halima! Please. - Pick her up, pick her up right how. - Halima! - Move it, move it! Wait there, move it! - I'm sorry for abandoning you when you needed me most. - I'm not your real mother. I needed a child so badly, so when my friend told me she could help, I had to do it. She's your mother. I just met her. She came all the way to look for you. - I'm so sorry. I didn't know you were still alive. I thought you were dead. But I'll do everything in my power to make sure you are okay, okay? Everything to make sure that you are well. - Mama. - No! Hold on, let me check your pulse. Oh my god, nurse! Nurse! Oh my god, don't die! No! - Halima, no, Halima, no! - Oh god! - Make her suffer! Silly girl! - Why are they marrying them off? That's the reason. Marry them off, they get pregnant, and then at the end of the day, you throw them away like piece of trash. This needs to stop, and that's the only thing I want. The government has to do something, everyone has to stand up to make sure that we restore our healthcare system. That is all I ask for. Restore our healthcare system. - Well said. We do wish you well. In case you want to reach out to Doctor Zara to support this cause, you can send your money... - Who is this women who is talking all over the place? - Um, I don't, I don't know. You don't know? You were sent a letter and you did nothing about it? - I'm sorry your lordship, we had other pressing issues. - What issue could be more pressing than this lunatic doctor who will do anything to paint this country bad. I want you to get to her and let her know that the assembly is interested in this case, whether the bill is passed or not, convince her that we care. - We are have tried as much as we can to really help, but without enough government support there is so little we can do. Ah. She's everywhere! Now get on it! - All right, your excellency. - Yes come to our mother hospital. Just come down. Where are you people from? Wait. Alex! Oh my god. What are you doing here? - I thought someone show come and keep an eye on you. - I'm sorry for running off on you like that. - You better not do it again. - Thank you so much for coming. Thank you. Mister speaker! - Please sit down. Honorable colleagues, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, before we go on, I'd like to say that I, I have decided to take over the chairmanship of this committee on this issue, because of the gravity, and the seriousness that it deserves. The whole country is asking questions and we must have the answer to give them. Dr. Zara Robbins, the floor is yours. - Thank you, honorable speaker, for this wonderful opportunity. I'm standing in front of you today, not just because I'm a woman, but first, I am a human being, and as such my fundamental human rights needs to be protected. The African woman can be described as the most endangered species of our world. Culture conditions her from cradle to a life of submission and subservience against her natural inclination for freedom and self-determination. She is at birth a child to be loved and cared for, but as she gains age and consciousness of her environment, archaic traditions discard and discount her social value to a mere object to be used and given away to almost anything to almost anybody! That I am alive today is a miracle. You all might wonder what is my story? My daughter Halima died in my arms few days ago from fistula. She was rushed to the hospital almost in a state of coma, the fistula has resulted in giving her septicemia and then she died. I'm a medical doctor, I have saved so many lives, but the one person that I cared about, the one person that I just wanted for one day to tell her how much I loved her. The one person I could have given everything for or could have done anything for, ended up dying in my arms. And you know what? I am not different from all these women who go through this trauma every day. I am just lucky. My parents died or rather they where killed by the rebels who invaded our village and killed everyone. I escaped and ran to my aunty's house, but she wasn't please to see me. - Silly girl! Why are you just coming back, eh? Can't you talk? It now takes you forever to bring water from the backyard. Her husband was nice to me at first, showered me with gifts, looked at me in awkward ways that I did not understand until eventually. Uncle stop! No, no, no! No, no, no! Uncle stop! - Why are you crying? - Uncle raped me. - Uncle raped you? What are you talking about? Hear this, evil child. After you have killed your parents, now you want to destroy my home? God forbid! Look at your mouth, rape? How do you know what rape is? Huh, Zara you cannot live in this house with me any longer. I said go, go, you must go! My aunty had to chase me away. I found myself on the streets. I was hawking and then two men kidnapped me and took me to a woman called Madam Kojo. Madam Kojo, who felt she owned me and could do anything with me, forced me into prostitution. And it was at that point that I realized that I was carrying my uncle's child. But Madam Kojo had her plans. She had other plans. She lied to me that my baby died. My baby! And then I developed fistula. - What? - Not again. - What is it? Must you do this every day? - How can you do this kind of a thing? Look at my body. I can't take this anymore. - Off to the witch who did this house. Go on! - Which kind of evil child is this? From one problem to the other. Now you are born, now your pikin' die, now you still do piss for house, witchcraft. Please return to wherever they brought you from. This witchcraft is not good for my business. Return, I beg leave my house. Leave my house now! The whole house is smelling. - I felt so ashamed that I meant nothing. I believed everything my aunty told me, that I was evil, that I killed my parents, that I allowed my uncle rape me, that everything happened to me that I deserved, that I'm such a horrible person. But you know what? The death of my daughter made me realize that no! I don't. I don't deserve it, I deserve to be happy, I deserve to be protected. I deserved to be loved. Just that I wish I could show the love that I got from my adopted mother to my daughter, who found me on the streets repaired me of fistula and then changed my life. Today I stand before you to speak for the rights and welfare of the daughters of Africa, to speak against their abuse and reduction to the status of material gifts. Especially at a tender age. The practice of underaged marriage, female circumcision, lack of access to medical care and education is a gross abuse of womanhood. I insist that the final and most decisive anti-fistula effort should commence now. Time has come for us to put a stop to this menace. Time has come for us to save ourselves from this crippling scourge. We need to enforce the Child Right Act. We need to pass the national health bill, create an agency for the eradication of Fistula in order to achieve our millennium developmental goals. And in all, I beg you, please, let these young girls have their childhood, because when it is taken away from them, you can never get it back. And in all of this today. I confront my abuser, who amazingly is one of you. Honorable Musa Abudullahi. I ask the honorable assembly not only to grant me the wishes of these women, but also bring to judgment to Honorable Musa for the crime he committed against a young girl many years ago. - Order! Order! - It's with pleasure that we unveil this center dedicated to Halima, the little girl that died of fistula. May God rest her soul. I hereby declare the official laying foundation of Halima Fistula Hospital and School of Education open. - Thank you so much. - Thank you very much.
