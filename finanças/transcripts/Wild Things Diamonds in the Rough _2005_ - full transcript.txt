That's... That's close enough, Miss Clifton. She left them to me. - They're mine. - That's for the court to decide. Your stepfather's challenge is for your own good. They're worth millions, Marie. Do you really think you're ready for that kind of responsibility? You are not gonna get away with this. Sorry. No shit. Testing. Testing. Who's he to say you're not responsible enough for the diamonds? He goes through money like water. You're 18 tomorrow. If you wanna get what's yours... ...you'll have to play him at his own game. Get a lawyer. With what? Lawyers cost money. If you win, you'll have shitloads. You don't know Jay. He wants those diamonds. He would rather go broke challenging my mother's will... ...than give me what's mine. Students, as spring break approaches... ...we are once again forced to tackle the subject of sex education. Dr. Johnson and Miss Richards... ...have graciously agreed to take time out of their busy schedules... ...to meet with us today. Dr. Johnson runs the forensic lab... ...at the police department. Doctor. Good morning. We're here today to... - He's hot. - Yeah. National studies report that sexual activity among students... ...is at an all-time high. This is no laughing matter. Reports of unwanted pregnancies are up by 16 percent. What's that thing on the skank's leg? Somebody said she's under juvie detention. Figures. - Reports of sexual assaults. Miss Richards is here today... ...to talk to you about her own harrowing personal experience. Good morning. My name is Kristen Richards... ...officer in the Juvenile Department of Corrections here in Blue Bay... ...as some of you may already know. That's not what brings me here today. Back in high school... ...all I wanted to do was party. By junior year... ...my life had become a blur of alcohol, drugs... ...and anonymous sex. - Whore! Then one night at a spring-break party in Miami... ...someone slipped a roofie in my drink... ...and raped me. - Oh, shit. No day goes by when my skin doesn't crawl... ...when I think of the pain and humiliation. I was never able to make a positive ID on the guy that raped me. All I can remember was him whispering in my ear: "You won't remember... ...but you'll never forget. " Now on the platform, from Blue Bay High... ...for her second dive in the final round... ...Marie Clifton. Quiet, please. The judges' scores are... Hey! That's more like it! Nine- eight, nine- seven... ...nine- nine, nine- nine... ...nine- eight. Overall... Nice takeoff. But work on your landing. That was near-perfect. I can't do any better than that. Oh, now, there's no such word as "can't. " Now on the platform... ...from Lambert High, Adele Moray. - Thanks, babe. - He's got nerve showing up... ...playing the loving stepfather after all he put you through. Why aren't you out there? Are you kidding me? He wouldn't miss this for the world. He's in his element. It's a sport for rich girls. Something I'm not. - So you fold towels. - I need a job. It's part of my probation. So you're a bad girl? I was. How bad? Long story. I'd rather not get into it. Quiet, please. Now on the platform, for her third and final dive... ...Marie Clifton of Blue Bay High. Listen, why don't you call me... ...and we'll see what we can do about getting you a real job. Better yet, talk to me later at Marie's party. I wasn't invited. You are now. Happy birthday. They're not diamonds, but... Thanks. He give you his present yet? No. You never know. He could do the right thing. Cut the bullshit, give you your inheritance. Over his dead body. Oh, hi, Mr. Clifton. Rad party, Mr. Clifton. Co?o, who is this guy? - Awesome party. - Not much of a consolation prize. Cheer up. You got the pick of the litter here. Just grab one and have some fun. No. You know, I think I'm gonna go talk to Jay. - Hey, Marie! Time for a birthday swim! - No, no, no! It can't be done. In construction there's always delays. Four months is not a delay. It's a fucking disaster. The building is almost finished. I give you my word! Every week the building's unfinished, we take a finger. Pray, Mr. Clifford, that you finish before the 11th week. - Oh, God, please... - The building is finished or you are. - Who were those men? - What happened? Nothing. What is that? What happened? Jay. Hey, don't bogart it. Are you okay? What happened? Don't worry about it. Who invited the towel girl? This is a private party, bitch. You're not invited. Your stepfather invited... If you're smart, stay away from him. - I don't want trouble. - But you're not smart. Stay away from him. Bitch! That's enough! Stop it! - It's my party and I didn't invite her. - I did. My apologies. My stepdaughter continues to prove... ...how immature she really is. My stepfather continues to prove what an asshole he really is. Little young, don't you think? Party's over. This place is amazing, Mr. Clifton. Well, it will be when it's finished. Are you okay? Yeah. I'm fine. Marie didn't hurt you, did she? No. You sure you don't wanna get out of those wet clothes? Jay! Late night? Okay, look. I was a bitch. I know. I'm sorry. I just thought, you know, that you... I was hoping you just kind of had a special present for me. The party was your present. What more could you possibly want? You know what I want. This conversation is over. Nothing's over. Mr. Clifton? Yes, officer. Can I help you? It's detective. And you're under arrest for suspicion of rape. - There's gotta be a mistake. - No, no mistake. - You have the right to remain silent. - What are you doing? Hey, come on, now. I didn't... I didn't do anything! Jay! Jay. Call my lawyer. Hey, watch the hair! Let's go over it again. It was Mr. Clifton. - What's Kristen Richards doing there? - Victim's probation officer. He raped me. Can I talk to you for a second? She one of yours? Did you miss me? Yeah. Possession with intent to sell. She was holding for her boyfriend, ended up taking the rap. She know what she's getting into? She was raped, Michael. How's your wife? She's doing just fine. We're getting divorced. I told you, it's bullshit. I didn't lay a hand on this girl. We're taking her statement. We'll run forensic tests. - Thank you, detective. - She's lying. If that's the case, you'll be out of here by tonight. Do you understand the seriousness of these charges, young lady? There's a battery of forensic tests. They're not pleasant. There's gonna be a background check. You're gonna have to testify in court, face the man you're accusing. You think I'm lying. Jay Clifton's an influential man here in Blue Bay. Not the guy to mess with if you're not willing to go the distance. Miss Sandoval, I'm Dr. Johnson. This is my assistant, Julie. Whenever you're ready, we'll need a urine sample for the rape test kit. If you'll remove your clothes, we need to do a physical exam. I'll wait outside. Dr. Johnson. You have to see this. Those are clear evidence markers. The camera, please. Thank you. Hey. How are you doing? What's up, boys? - Detective. - Doctor. Here to see where all the real work happens? What you got? You're not supposed to be here, Kristen. I thought you could use a little help. - How long you known her? - She was assigned to me months ago. In foster care most of her life. So you buy the whole story? The rape? Yeah. Yeah, I do. Something in the eyes. I've had a little experience, remember? - Gotcha. - What have you got? Well, we have got prints. The Holy Grail. - Good morning, doctor. - Good morning. Dr. Johnson, do your tests show... ...that Elena Sandoval had sexual intercourse... ...on the night of the 25th? Yes, they do. And would you describe your findings... ...as being conclusive with forced penetration? Absolutely. There was extensive bruising and tearing. We found no semen... ...but latex abrasions point to the use of protection. This is quite common in cases of premeditated rape. What could you tell us about Miss Sandoval's toxicology reports? Positive ingestion of Rohypnol, a common date-rape drug. Would you care to explain state's exhibit number one, please, doctor? Yes. Miss Sandoval's body... ...was found to have a bite mark on her upper torso. Excuse me, Dr. Johnson. Can you tell me about the other markings toward the side? I wasn't able to determine the exact nature of those. Fingernail markings, possibly. Thank you. Were you able to draw conclusions from analysis of these teeth marks? The tests I conducted show that there's no other conclusion. The bite marks on her body were caused by the defendant... ...Mr. Jay Clifton. Put that down. - I was just... - Yeah. I don't know what you're trying to do... ...but you're not gonna get a dime from my stepfather. - He's up to his ass in debt. - He attacked me. With no help from you, I'm sure. Bye-bye. Fucking slut. Oh, crap. Need some sugar? Bachelor's dinner. I just wanted a snack, you know? What are you still doing here? Shouldn't you be back at probation office? Oh, I took some time off. - You did, huh? - Yeah. What's that? I don't know. Let's take a look at it. - Why aren't you out there? - It's a sport for rich girls. - He looks interested. - Something I'm not. - He does, doesn't he? - Yeah. Who sent this to you? It seems the assistant diving coach records all their meets. Thought for some reason we might wanna see this. - Thoughtful. - Yeah. Maybe we should talk to her. "We"? Listen, why don't you call me... ...and we'll see what we can do about getting you a real job. Talk to me later at Marie's party. - I wasn't invited. - You are now. My client talked to her. So what? By the look on his face, he had a bit more than just talking in mind. That is ridiculously accusatory. I know what a man's thinking when he looks like that. - This is insane. - No, this is rape! - Alleged rape. - I just offered... I just offered her a job. And an invitation to a birthday party. That is not a crime. - How about Risa Howard? - Who's Risa Howard? - She filmed this, Your Honour. - Who? I interviewed her a couple hours ago. She said she was supposed to videotape the meet... ...but she couldn't believe how sleazy Jay Clifton was acting. - That's crazy! - Enough. Overactive imagination. Is this what you're basing your case on? That and everything else you've already heard in court. If you plead guilty to rape... ...the state's prepared to drop the kidnapping and assault charges. Out of the question. Detective Morrison. What happened? Your stepfather's in a lot of trouble. I can't believe you're doing this. You're not gonna get away with this, bitch. Let's go. I can't believe this is happening. Jay. How are you holding up? - I'm in some shit here. - Well, if there's anything I can do... Theo doesn't think there's any way out. I'm gonna have to take their offer. Which means what? Which means I'm going to prison for a few years... ...as opposed to a lot of years. You really didn't do it, did you? No! I swear to God I didn't do it. I don't know why she's doing this to me. Money. She hasn't asked for any. She's trailer trash. She sees what we have and wants it. Wants it bad enough to set you up. Well, what am I supposed to do? Maybe you should give it to her. I mean, I could find out how much she wants. I'm not hearing any of this. Look, this could ruin my... Our whole lives. Okay? I don't want that to happen. Let's say she'd take some money to go away. I don't have any. I'm tapped out. I'm up to my ass in debt with the bank. And construction loans. What about the diamonds? You'd do that for me? It's what Mom would have wanted. I mean, we're a family, after all. She'd want cash. - How do we do it? - This isn't a good idea, Jay. Theo, could it be done? I represented an importer years ago. He might find someone... ...to front money against their worth. But nobody's gonna do anything without clear title to the inheritance. Let's do it. - Hello. - Listen to me, you little slut. Get your ass over to my house right now. I want to talk to you. Hello? Is anyone here? He cleared my inheritance. Kiss me. Not yet. Mind if Chad joins in? Fuck me. Anytime. Anyplace. I can't believe it was that easy. And now all you have to do is get on the stand... ...and do the right thing. - And swear to tell the truth... - The whole truth... And nothing but the truth. I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth... ...and nothing but the truth. So help me God. - We're good. - How much did she want? Way too much, 250. But it's worth every penny. - Good morning, Miss Sandoval. - Good morning. It's your assertion that my client, Mr. Clifton... ...sexually assaulted you on the night of the 25th. Is that true? Is that what you say happened? No, he didn't... ...just sexually assault me. - What do you mean? - He didn't just sexually assault me. He threatened to kill me if I told anyone. Isn't it true that you were drunk that night? I remember two things clearly that night. One was Jay Clifton raping me. The other was what he whispered in my ear right before I blacked out: "You won't remember... ...but you'll never forget. " You lying bitch! You can't do this to me! She's lying. I didn't do anything! I'm innocent! The testimony proved damning for Clifton. The jury took less than an hour to deliberate... ...and sentence him to 15 years in prison. This is Shirley Cina, reporting for... Hell, it could be a coincidence. I don't think so. She heard me speak at the school. - How'd she get here to Blue Bay? - Miami sent her to me. I found her a place to live, got her enrolled in school. I don't know, Kristen. All the evidence points to a rape. - Michael, I'm telling you, she's lying. - Why? I don't know. But I say we have a little talk with her. Oh, she fucked me! - We got to do something. - We'll appeal. You gotta get me out of here. Since you're relatively new to the community... ...the court considers you a flight risk. - Something's not right. - I wanna talk to the police. - About what? About what I did. About the money. I don't know if that's such a good idea. Don't worry. I'll leave you out of it. Well... ...it doesn't look like anybody's here. One way to find out, I guess, huh? Elena! Blue Bay P.D. I guess we go back and get a warrant. Come back in the morning. Michael. She stole my life. Jesus. I thought you were gonna leave them in the bank. Well, the doctor has found us a buyer. They're so beautiful. A beautiful 4 million. Maybe we should wait. Sell them legitimately. Be heartbreaking to see the mother and daughter split up. We've been over this. That would take months, and we can't risk... ...Jay finding a way to block the sale. Okay? We could get more for them. True. But... ...a bird in the hand... ...is worth two in the bush. Okay. For the sake of argument, let's pretend that you're telling the truth. You didn't rape Elena Sandoval... ...and she took this bribe you gave her. So why didn't she clear you in court? What is this, the Spanish Inquisition? How the fuck should I know? You're the detective. Figure it out. He didn't mean that. It's just that we don't know the answer... - You don't know the answer? - Tell me something. Exactly whose idea was it to offer Elena money to go away? - Actually, it was... - Why? What are you getting at? If you're telling the truth and she is setting you up for some reason... ...then maybe she had a little help. Son of a... I signed away my challenge to the will. Meaning what? What does that mean, huh? Mr. Clifton is in a legal battle with his stepdaughter. - She's got the goddamn diamonds. - Don't. You're telling me that Marie helped Elena set up this rape? Yeah, but wait. What about the evidence? They would have needed help. Yeah, they would have. Hey, hey, hey. We've got big problems. - What's up? - Nothing. I'll tell you later. Come here. - What the hell? - I think I fucked up. - How? - I don't know for sure... ...but I think someone was in my trailer last night. "Someone"? My probation officer, probably. Okay, well, you... You disposed of everything, right? I did, but... But what if Jay told them what you did? Sweetie, men aren't smart enough for that. Don't worry. I'm not gonna let the big bad wolf get you. We're gonna get away with this, right? Absolutely. Abso-fucking-lutely. - Hey. Got a minute? - Actually, no. This won't take long. We just wanna ask a couple of questions. We really have things to do. So go do them. I'll call you later. So, what's this about? Lose a diamond? Actually, no. It's always been like that. Just waiting for the right stone? Something like that. - So, what do you want? - Your stepfather alleges... ...that you conspired to get him falsely imprisoned for rape. Yeah, right! Yeah, he does. He says that you talked him into signing away... ...any rights he had over the diamonds. And why would I do that? To bribe Elena Sandoval into dropping the charges against him. Only that was never gonna happen. In fact, your stepfather never raped Elena, did he? He was found guilty. Yeah. He was. Thanks to you and Elena. And a little help from Blue Bay Forensics. I can't imagine what you're talking about. How about you planned this to get him give up his claim... ...against your inheritance? Like I said, I don't know what you're talking about... ...except my mother left those diamonds to me. Not him. Me. Well, that's good. Because I understand... ...you've already gone and collected your inheritance. Good news travels fast. So you got your priceless stones... ...except now you've got partners to deal with. Two diamonds, three players. That could get ugly. Yeah. - Are we done? - Yeah. We're done for now. This is harassment. I could sue you. Well, knock yourself out, kid. Tell you what, you and my ex-wife can divvy up whatever I got left. Detective. Miss Richards. Is there something I can do for you? Yeah, I was wondering if you could run a quick test for us. No problem. Please be careful. I try to maintain a sterile environment. Are these the evidence photos from the Elena Sandoval rape? - Yes, they are, but... - Did you, by any chance... ...ever find out what caused these markings here? Well, like I... Like I told the judge, my guess is fingernails. Could it have maybe been a prong setting of a ring? One that's possibly missing its stone? Yeah. It's possible. Marie Clifton has a ring like that. Right? You don't say. No, I do say. Come on. The pill. It's Rohypnol. You don't say. Fuck. Hello? What the hell? We're screwed. Morrison and that bitch were sniffing around today. They know something. - Calm down. - You fucking calm down! They asked about your ring, genius. They're onto something. I can feel it. They were fishing, okay? If we stay cool and stick to the plan, everything will be fine. - I should move the diamonds tonight. - You said you couldn't till next week. It might mean a little less dough... ...but the fan is spinning and the shit is coming. How much less? It will still be enough to keep us liquid until time runs backwards. No. I say we wait. Where are the diamonds? They're safe. Don't worry your pretty little head about it. - I wanna see them. - Why? Because I want to, goddamn it. You know, you need to calm down. I got a goddamn right to see them. We're partners. Fine. Two million dollars. Wait. I thought you said you could get... What? You said... Don't fight it. - What did you? - Don't fight it. Hey, yeah. I can do it. But it's gotta be tonight. No, no, no. Come on. Not tomorrow. Tonight. Now. No. What? Hey. All right. Tomorrow. Fine. Nine a. m. At the diner. Yeah, I'll be there. Chad, don't. The doctor is sorry. Bastard. - Yeah? - Chad fucked us. I know. I was there. No, Elena, I mean he really fucked us. - He stole my diamonds. - You've gotta be kidding me. No, I'm not kidding. - Fuck! - Would you keep it down? I have a headache. We have to hurry. I know where he's going. - You think he'll sell them? - Not if we find him first. Pull over, asshole! What? Pull over, asshole! Fuck you. Son of a bitch. God... ...damn! Hi. Michael. Hi. - Where'd all that all come from? - A meth bust a couple of months ago. - Over 300 grand. - No kidding. - Yeah. So, what's up? - I tried calling Elena again. - Still no answer. - Any idea where she is? None, which is what worries me. Listen, I've gotta catalog this. Come on. Fuck! You okay? - Where is he? - I don't fucking know! That little shit has my diamonds. We're not hurting him. We just get our diamonds back. I'm not gonna hurt him. I'm gonna kill him. Marie. Marie! You smell good. - Look, I'm sorry I never... - What? You never did anything to me. And I have no regrets. What? What do you want me to do? Do you want me to go away? No. Because I can't. You're gonna have to be the one to end it. Wherever you hide, we're gonna find you, you little weasel. Gotcha! Come on, Chad. Where the fuck are you? I'm not gonna hurt you. We just want our fucking diamonds back. - Damn. We're in big fucking trouble. - What now? I'm more than 10 miles away from the police department. Oh, God, Elena. Are you telling me... ...that your parole officer knows we're out here? She knows. Great. It's just fucking great. - Shoot! - What? Elena. Fuck. Shit. I've gotta get out of here now or she'll find us. Do you hear that? You go that way. Go. Fuck! Fuck! Come on! Fuck! Elena! Shit. Where the fuck are you? Elena, do you see him? Come on, Chad. Where the fuck are you? Bitch! - No! - Fucking bitch! Come here! - Come on. Okay, no, no. Don't! - Marie! - Marie! - Elena, shut up. - Come here! - Marie! Shut up! Sorry. Fucking bastard. You killed him. Where the fuck are the diamonds? All right. Grab a leg. Elena, come on. Grab a fucking leg. - We're getting closer. - Which way? - Left. - All right. God. All right. Get rid of the body. And his car. Where are you going? We've got an appointment. To sell the diamonds. My parole officer is gonna find me any second. Then I suggest you get to work. Fuck! Get in there. Where the fuck is this diner? Come on! Fuck! - Where's Johnson? - Dead. How could a delicate thing like you accomplish that? Who said I did? So, what brings you here? Diamonds. Money. Show me what you got. You show me yours, I'll show you mine. Two million dollars. The deal was four. Johnson agreed to 2 million. He's dead. Remember? Two million is all I got. Then you only get one diamond. All right, let's see it. You're sure this is the diamond you wanna sell me? Meaning? What do you mean? These are priceless. You're priceless, trying to pawn those shitty fakes. - Are you crazy? - They're fakes! And not very good ones at that. Wait! Fuck me. Would you care to explain what you're doing? It was an accident. I swear. You're in some serious shit. It was an accident, huh? What were you doing out there? I was just out cruising, I saw the car... Hey, hey. Who the fuck do you think you're talking to, huh? We got your tracks dragging his body to the car... ...and forensics found that he was killed by a blow to the head. Now, we're talking about murder. You understand that? I didn't kill him. You didn't kill him? Okay, who did, huh? We can't help you unless you help us, Elena. What do you want me to do? Well, you can start by telling the truth. - So Marie planned it all. - Lf you believe her. Elena's not smart enough to have thought this out. - Marie has the brains and the motive. - Let's talk it over with the DA. It's Elena's word against Marie Clifton's. Who do you think the court will believe? What are you thinking? Use Elena to set Marie up. All right. Where have you been? I've been trying to call for hours. The cops found me out there. - What happened? - Nothing. I said I was cruising, and didn't think about being past my probation... ...I saw the car and almost got killed trying to help him. - And they believed you? - Yeah. They let me go. - What about you? - They were fakes. - What were fakes? - The diamonds. - I don't understand. - Jay must've just switched them... ...for fakes or something. The guy fucking laughed at me. - Where are the real ones? - Well, gee, Elena, I don't know. What are we gonna do? I have an idea. Meet me at my house at 10. What now? - What do I do? - Just get her to admit she killed him. And if she won't? Then you're in big trouble. Can you guys hear me? This thing work? I don't think I can do this. Do what? She's gonna blow it. Whatever it is you've got planned. Don't worry. Everything is gonna be fine. That's easy for you to say. You're not the one who almost got killed out there in the swamp. But $4 million would make it all worth your while. How do you plan on getting that now? Because the real diamonds... ...are in Jay's safe at the construction site. How do you know that? I have my sources. He'll just take Chad's share in the diamonds. What about the combination? How do you expect to get into the safe exactly? You believe the balls on this girl? That, my love... ...is where you come in. I don't... All you have to do... ...is tell Jay you set him up... ...and that you'll sign a confession if he gives us the combination. She is amazing. You might spend a little time in juvie... ...but I will make it all worth your while. You're out of your mind. First, you kill Chad... ...and now this. Well, you wanna be with me, don't you? Yeah? Please. For us. Is that a yes? Please. Well, well, well. Looks like you two kissed and made up. Very funny. Now give us the combination to the safe. Look, you wanna get out of here, then you'll give me what's mine. And how, pray tell, are you gonna get me out of this hellhole? It's a confession. Dated but not signed. You give us the real diamonds, and I'll sign it. And this goes into the mail, Priority to Detective Morrison. How do I know you're gonna do what you say you'll do? You're just gonna have to trust us. - I've been down that road before. - This is non-negotiable. Jay? We have no grounds for appeal. This could be your last chance. So? Fuck it. Eight, 20, 99. The combination is the day Mom died? You sick bastard. Would you slow down? We're in enough trouble as it is. We are in no trouble at all. But you killed Chad. Whatever. - Home free. - We would be if you hadn't killed him. - What is your obsession? - I just don't think he had to die. Talk to me. I need to know you're not planning to do the same to me. - She's a smart one. - Give it a rest. Too smart for her own good. Come on. Keep pushing. Why won't you just admit it? You killed him in cold blood. What the fuck is that? She's been made. Stay in the car. - No. She's my respon... - Stay in the car! What are you doing? It's already been done. What the fuck are you talking about? Don't worry. Everything is gonna be fine. Oh, no! You fucking did it, you little bitch! Shit! Elena. Fuck! Elena. Come on, sweetie. Just give me my diamonds back. Come on. I thought we were in this together, huh? Come out. Everything will be... I didn't have a choice. She was gonna shoot us. It's all right. It's okay. So where did you get the gun? I live in a trailer park, detective. Where do you think I got it? I don't suppose you've got a permit for it, do you? Would you cut her some slack, Michael? She's lucky she had it. You're still in a lot of trouble. She knows. I'm gonna take her home. Have one of your deputies give us a ride. I'll bring her by in the morning, all right, at 10:00? Hey. Are you sure that there were no diamonds in that safe? It pissed her off. That's when she grabbed me and found the mike. Come on. We'll see you in the morning. Those diamonds were in that safe. She's lying! We didn't find any diamonds. They weren't on either one of the girls. - Maybe they're hiding them. - You're free, Mr. Clifton. - Why don't you go find them? - Hey! Bullshit! Awfully convenient how they disappeared... ...after you and your men showed up, don't you think? Get your client out of here before his mouth gets him in more trouble. Come on, Jay. Hey. It's me. You said you'd be in by 10. It's after 11. Give me a call, huh? Better yet, just get your ass in here. - Detective Morrison. - Yeah? What's up? Dammers. Internal Affairs. It's gone. All $350,000 in seized evidence. What's this got to do with me? I was hoping you'd be able to answer that. - What? - No one's been here... ...since the money was put here, except you. Your key card was the last one to open the locker. It's so beautiful. The mother. And the daughter. It seems Elena Sandoval was given up for adoption when she was born. The records show that the blood mother was Kristen Richards. Something to do with a rape case down in Miami. The girl had a decent life with her adopted parents... ...until she suddenly disappeared just before school started a few weeks ago. She was never on probation? Nope. Never. They set the whole thing up. Kristen Richards had a spotless record her whole life. What set her off? You know the guy I really feel sorry for? The cop. Hell hath no fury. I never wanted to hurt him. He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. How about a fresh one? A girl after my own heart. Boy, you two look so good... ...that it's difficult to tell the mother from the daughter. Oh, that's just the roofies talking. What did you say? South Florida, class of '88, hell of a party. You know, I'd never actually tasted cocktails like that before. L... I don't... What are you talking about? You and me. It was like being awake during an operation. You can feel everything going on, only there's nothing you can do. - What? - I wasn't sure, when you moved here... ...to Blue Bay a few years ago. So I did a little digging. Your college yearbook photo sealed the deal. - And I knew it was you. - What the fuck are you talking about? You took something from me that night... ...but you left a little something behind. A daughter. What night? I don't remember. - You may not remember. - But you'll never forget. Oh, man! Nice takeoff. Gotta work on the landing. Must be heartbreaking, being in the kind of financial trouble you're in... ...having those diamonds just sitting right there. Who the hell are you? There's no way to beat her in court. How did you get in here? But you take Marie out of the picture, and all your troubles go away. We should talk. - I just really want what's mine. - That's what I'm saying. The diamonds are your inheritance. You deserve them. I just don't know if my fucking stepfather is ever gonna give up. That's why we've gotta make this a really good show. You listen to me and we'll pull this fucker off, guaranteed. Hey, Risa. I'm a very busy man. I'll call you when the tests are done. Will you take a check? Fuck, no. Money talks... ...bullshit walks. Then how would you... ...like to make some real money? Chad likes the sound of that. We're not hurting him, Marie. We just get our diamonds back. Oh, no. I'm not gonna hurt him. I'm gonna fucking kill him. Showtime, Mother. Ladies? Very impressive. Truthfully, I never thought you could pull it off. So let's see our future. And the diamonds? How do I know they're the real thing? You're just gonna have to trust us.
