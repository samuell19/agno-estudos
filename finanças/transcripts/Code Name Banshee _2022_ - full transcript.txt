We need to know what you know. It wasn't my op. I have no intel. It wasn't authorized. No. Why'd you call me here? Jeremy and Caleb have disappeared. As you can see, they delivered an asset into the hands of the Russians. CIA contracted Anthony Greene and his team to stop them. Reads like an ambush. Yeah, there was a shootout. The asset got away. We need to know everything that they might have shared. What happened to my father and Caleb? Caleb, he fled. He went underground. My father? Greene reported that your father went down, but he had to remove any dead and wounded before anyone else arrived. Where's his body? I'm assuming the Russians got him. Perhaps Caleb came back. I don't know. The site was clean once we arrived back. As of 1800 hours last night, their status has been changed internally. The CIA has deemed them as traitors, and they now have a bounty on their head. Their position with this organization has been forfeited And anyone working with them is now in question. Are you suggesting that I'm a traitor? Within time, I'm sure you can repair the damage that's been done by... Banshee, don't do this. You're not an enemy of the state. We both know that Caleb and my father were loyal to this organization. Well, in light of this current situation, I'm not really sure right now. Don't do this! Take my name off your books. I'm out. And when I find out what really happened, I'll return for all of you that left them out there to fucking die. I got control of the cameras. You're good to go. In and out, just like we planned. There'll be two in the lobby. - Any others? - None visible. Second set of elevators. And your chariot is on its way. There's no way those guys are Feds. Obviously, he knows there's a price on his head. What the hell did this guy do anyway? I'm the executioner, not the judge. Damn it! - Kronos? - One second. I'm having some technical difficulty. Are they taking it back? No, no, no. Don't worry. I need to know. Am I walking into a trap? No, it's just an elevator. I wouldn't worry. Talk to me. All right, there's one small thing. There's no such thing as a small thing. I couldn't access the camera on this floor. And? Ugh, someone's overriding my control in the elevator. Do something. I can't! Well, well, well. There she is. Banshee... You still going with that? Anthony Greene. It's been a minute. You took my kill. You just cost me a million dollars. No. I didn't cost you a penny, sweetheart. In fact, I'm going to give you the credit and the money. And all you have to do is hand over your boy Caleb. Oh, man, you're still on that? Really? It's kind of sad, don't you think? No, uh, I fucking don't. 'Cause every second that I get closer to that piece of shit is a second well spent. Five years is kind of a long time to track someone, but a revenge killing is a revenge killing, I guess. Uh-huh. For what he did, I'm going to take his life. Hmm. We both know he's off the grid. He's a fucking ghost. Yeah, he's a fucking ghost. That's why you're the perfect person to track him down. If I didn't know any better, I would think that you're too big of a pussy to take me on one-on-one. Oh. Shut the fuck up. I ain't come here to play. Banshee, do some thinking. 'Cause end of the day, we both know how this shit's going to end. Don't we? I do. Kronos, open the door! Opening elevator doors. Go! - Kronos! - I'm trying! Got it. Walkie. She's on her way down. Do you hear me? She's on her way down. Move, move, move. I take it we're not getting that 1 million. Not now. I really needed that money. Door's about to open. Are you ready? Fucking bring it. How many? Two in the lobby. Anthony's on the move. I'm trying to stop him. - Kronos, start the car now! - Done. What? So one person did all of this to us. Who was she talking to? - She called him Kronos. - Go on this. I wanna know who he is, where he is. I want my hands on him. Clean this shite up. Well, that was fun, Banshee. Dude, I've told you ten million times do not call me that. How do you know Anthony Greene? He's former Special Forces who's made it his goal in life to hunt down people for the CIA. So he's part of the Collective and you want him dead? He killed someone who's close to me. If he's an assassin, why does he have so many guys? Because he's a fucking pussy, and he knows I would kill him. I need you to find someone for me. That's what I'm here for. Find Caleb Navvaro. Are you serious? Caleb Navvaro? That's our target? Yes. We're talking about the same Caleb Navvaro? The one that trained you and ran black ops? That's the one. D, there's a thousand people named Caleb Navvaro. If Greene couldn't find him, there's no way I will. He's been underground for five years. And we just lost out on a whole lot of money. Can we please just move on to the next contract? We will not have another shot at Anthony. Are you serious? It's you versus a small army. Please. I'm not letting him win again. You've seen the photographs. Told you he's dead. Listen, I want our money in my account by the end of the week. Sir? No, as usual, it's a million. Yeah, sure. Yeah, always a pleasure. What? I've a lead on Kronos. - And? - Top-rate hacker. Acts as a middle man for Banshee. Apparently, he's been her eyes and ears for a few years. So where is he? I don't know yet. So find him, and before sun up. All right, let's see what the CIA has to say. If they knew anything, he'd be dead, and we would not be having this conversation. Is this about the traitor thing? Amongst other things, yes. The price on this guy's head is 10 million. I know. And you didn't kill him. Why? You don't understand. Greene and Caleb are worth so much fucking more to me than 10 mil. All right. Would you say you knew him better than anyone? Yes. Definitely. He had to slip up at some point, shared some kind of info that could help us. If you were Caleb, where would you go? He's from Chicago. Would he go back? Nah, nah, nah, nah. No, no, definitely not. He'd gain too much attention there. Favorite vacation spots, friends, family, something, let's... let's work with something here. Wellburg. Check Wellburg. - Where the hell is Wellburg? - Jersey. All right, there's a few homes that were purchased five years ago. Some businesses opened up too. Barb's Hardware. We have an Italian place. And there's a bar named Old Well Tavern. That's it, that's it! Old Well Tavern, that's it. Old Well Tavern, It's owned by Walter Herrero. Looks like Mr. Herrero bought the house and bar about three years ago. Mm. Lay low for two years, start a new life. That's fucking him. Take me there. Update the GPS. This is what I call a game. Players who can actually play. It's a rerun, Rick. Still. You know what I'm saying, right? Our team can't stay healthy, and our bullpen sucks. Ugh. I can't see that changing any time soon. Imagine if we got some decent pitching like those guys. Hmm. We'd be a ball club worth playing against. Ah! Another shot. What was the, uh, home team where you come from again? Laredo, right? Nuevo Laredo, across the river. Mm. Do you run a tavern there too? You always drink this much at 10:00 a.m.? Kronos? I'm here. How are you this morning? Probably better than you are. Did you drive all night? No, I stopped at some dumpy... Some dumpy... Gee, Kronos, come on, man. All right, I'm here. I'm here. Anyway, so I stopped at some dumpy place, and I had a shower and a little bit of sleep. Little vacation. Shut up. You're almost there. I know. There's something I wanna talk to you about. This is kind of a personal matter, so I'm gonna go offline until I sort things out with Caleb. No complaints with me. I finally get a day off. Good to know. I'll see you on the other side, my friend. Godspeed, Banshee. Don't fucking call me that. Mmm! You're a real asshole, you know that? The only reason I keep coming back here is because my wife's a bitch and you open early. - Well, at least you come back. - Yes. Yes. Sorry. No, it was my fault. I'm the one who should be sorry. And between me and you, get your drinks and leave. The owner is a real crank. He's always been that way. Yeah. Anybody else here? Mornings are quiet. There is a latch right behind you. You know what to do. I assume you want these down? Sure. Caleb, don't. I have to. And you too. Just slowly. That's good. It's great to see you too. Yeah. How did you find me? You said you were going to buy this place someday. Hmm. You were drunk, but... - What? - Sincere. You remember that? I'm not here to kill you. Okay. So what is my price anyway? 4 mil, 5 mil? Ten. Well, that feels pretty good. And it's, uh... it's gonna get collected if you don't listen to me. Anthony Greene is gunning for you. He, uh, beat me to a job and ambushed me... and offered me a mil to give you up. So you gave me up. Who do you think I am? I haven't seen you in years, so I don't know. And whose fault is that? I am not gonna let him get away this time. And I can't handle his army alone. It looks like I... I trained you well. So... Hey, Suit, don't move! Who's the girl with the black hair? - She's my daughter. - Your what? Yeah. Hailey, she's fine. Who is she? Uh, she's an old friend from work. Are you a hostage? No! No. Just stop pointing your gun at our guest, right? You have a lot of explaining to do. Yeah. Well, you know, Hailey, this is, uh, Delilah. Delilah, Hailey. Come on, give me that. Get ready to lose everything you own, Dogmom93. ♪ Don't talk to me ♪ ♪ Don't talk to me ♪ ♪ I have nothing left ♪ Ah, damn it! She's good. ♪ I told you no ♪ ♪ Your chance is... ♪ Hmm. Hello? Hello? Hello? Kronos, are there any guns hidden in here? We're gonna find them if there are, so... make things easier for yourself and tell us. I always keep a revolver in the pizza box. Hmm. Kronos. What a shithole. So you're a gambler, huh? That's expensive. You ever won? Not my lucky day. Eh. I wouldn't say that. Yet. So this is how you live, huh? Computers and fucking plants. Plants don't talk back. Kronos, perhaps over here would be more comfortable. Okay. So you know the man I've been looking for, don't ya? No. Well, I got a hunch that you know exactly where the fuck he is. No. Well, if you don't know where he is, maybe Banshee does. And I know for sure you know where she is. I'm here to offer you something. That there... is a million dollars. Now, what's your usual cut? 20% maybe? Look at the balls on this guy. Tell him. Your real name's Michael Shea Thomson. You graduated from MIT with a degree in computer science before joining the Department of Homeland Security, where you spent every waking moment preventing Russian cyberattacks. That is, until you realized there's more money in contracting and made the switch. He knows me. Yeah, we know you. Your mom and dad are dead. And I can't find anyone who loves you that I can terrify and hurt. So... do I just kill you and then find Banshee on my own? No? Well, that's kinda handy 'cause I'm not much of a computer guy. But these four people in this room are very, very good at hurting people. And they will hurt you for hours. Now, do I have to keep you alive? Not at all. Is it convenient for me? Maybe. I wanna run your contracts. I wanna be your eyes and your ears. I wanna be your new cyber guy. Why would I do that? 'Cause I can give you Banshee. Let's make this deal. You give me Banshee, you give me Caleb. But if you try and fuck me, son, I'll find ya. Is your mom a painter? Was. She's dead. Nancy got diagnosed with cancer four years ago. She... she died a few months before we moved here. I'm sorry. Yeah. If she's your friend, then how does she not know about Mom? Well, we... we... we weren't that close, actually. Are you kidding? What are you guys talking about? Your dad and my dad were very close, so we grew up together. Was your dad in construction? We worked into... In construction together. Yep, well, there was a time... we'd be in some kind of danger spots and... Yeah, like when we had to build skyscrapers and had to have each other's backs. What does any of that have to do with not knowing about Mom? Well... it's been a long time, Hailey, really. Yeah. Well, she knows where we are. Does she know about the mob? Hailey, enough. Don't you have some homework to do or a show to watch on television? - Fine. - Good. I'll go upstairs. Thank you. Hey, I'm sorry. I'm... okay. All right. Good night. Construction worker? Really? Out of all the options that you had, you went with construction worker? Yeah. Construction sites in big cities can get tangled with dirty people, giving me a reason to move to a small town. So construction. Ah, so you're hiding from the mob? Makes sense, why she said hello at gunpoint. Oh, and you're training her to fight the mob. Well, it's interesting because it's very similar to how you trained me. Yeah. So you wanted to talk about Anthony. - Yes. - Mm-hmm. Was he there that night with you and my father? No, no, no, no. We're done with my past, eh? We're talking about Anthony. This isn't about your past. You are... You were such an amazing mentor for me. And I need you. I really do. I need your help. You know, all your questions are for Anthony. Yeah, he was there. Was he alone? Did he bring anyone? Does it matter? No. So you're gonna fight Stalin Jr.? - No. - Oh. We are going to fight him together. Don't you wanna stop hiding? Can't change the past. I am fine. I'm fine right here. What happened to you? You know, I... I wish your father was here as much as you do. I know what it feels like to be alone. There is more to life than just contract killing. I'm happy now. Right here, right now, yes. Well, I'm happy for your happiness. Thank you. But, um... I am not gonna be your bait. Hey, it was a good move. Well, you taught me well. Hold on. The files on your dad are two in back. Good night, Banshee. Thank you. You're welcome. Malia, this is Mr. Navvaro. He's a friend of myself and our organization. Uh... Miss Malia, I... I understand, uh, your father is, uh, is a powerful man. You know who he is. I do. I would like to know who you are. And I also would like to know what do you get out of this whole thing? Protection. All I want is protection. But, yeah. But you don't get protection just because your father is a billionaire. You know I can't grant it. On that drive is just a taste. Customers, transactions, but most important, blueprints to weapons most governments don't even know about. The government, with all the secrets he's stolen, takes a leap forward by ten years. Right. - It's all there. - I'm sure it is. Or it's all fake and you're just, uh, setting us up. I don't care what you suits think. I get you the names of all his buyers and the locations of all his weapons, and I get protection. He's a monster, and I need you to hide me as far away from him as you can. Right. I'll make some calls, yeah. Good morning. Hmm. So that's what happened. I knew it. I knew it, I knew it, I knew it. I fucking knew it. Where's my dad? Move on. You know nothing has changed. Nothing. They didn't recover his body. He could still be out there. Banshee, I saw him go down. But they didn't find him. He could still be out there. You know, I-I-I told you yesterday, that's, uh... That's a question for Anthony. Good morning. Am I interrupting something? Uh, no. Just, uh, having a cup of coffee. Speaking of which, uh, I should be going. Ugh. D, call the tavern if anything comes up. The pub has a front and a back door that leads to a parking lot. It's pretty straightforward. There's nothing straightforward about Caleb. What about the house? Dead-end streets surrounded by woods. Banshee's probably there. That means Caleb knows that you're coming. We're coming? Are you not going? Oh, Jesus Christ, you know what? You want to question me again? Please. Do I need to find another assistant? How long? Um, six hours or so. Call the Philly team. What are you thinking? Two teams. One takes the house, one takes the tavern. They can be there within the hour. And tell the team that goes to the Old Well, you know, be subtle, be quiet. Caleb is smart. It may all be for not. Tell them to text me when they're in position. Got it. And remind them I want him alive. Alive and kicking 'cause he's mine. You got it? Got it. So make the damn call. You, find me a take-away. I'm starving. All right, so we head out at 1500. No sooner, no later. Stay off the main road at all cost. We wouldn't want any uninvited guest during the party. Now, when we reach the outskirts of town, we hit dirt. Now, all off-road until we find an old packing house about seven clicks out. There, the handoff to the CIA happens. Male and female agents, they will take Malia and her drives into protective custody. Good? Happiness? All right, so get some coffee, take a nap, and be ready. - Jeremy, wait. - What is it? This all sounds great, Mr. Navvaro. But? But there's no Plan B. This is a routine op. We have done it hundreds of times, and I trust my men, believe me. Seems as though you've taken every precaution against my father's men, who are definitely out there hunting for me right now. But you've taken no precautions against your own men. Malia, if I may, it is normal to be a little nervous or even paranoid as we get closer to the handoff. - Is it.. - But... More rational to be paranoid or careless? I am risking everything being here. You have no idea what he'll do to me if he catches me. I've held up my end of the bargain, and I expect you to do the same. We are. Have you met the agents I'm being handed off to? Of course. They are CIA agents with top clearance. The CIA's always been the most trustworthy organization. Let us do our job, Malia. In six months, you will be living wherever you want and doing whatever the fuck you want. Trust me, okay? Okay. Hey, it's okay. Used to be one of my favorites. Used to? Memories suck when you know how they end. So what's your deal? My deal? You came here to get my dad's help, but you haven't done anything but eat and stare at photos of my family. Were you lovers or something? No. I've known him since I was seven. Is he in danger? Look, I know he's in danger with the mob. I looked at your file on the table. Are you with the government or something? You shouldn't have done that. I'm sorry. I couldn't help it. I feel like he's in danger, and he is all I have left. Hey, if he's in danger, I need to know, because I will not let anything... Stop! I'm here to help you. Now, tell me everything that you know. Sit. Sit. Tough, but quiet bar owner. Love it. Let's start with, uh, three beers. Sure. All right. And some menus. Oh, I'm sorry, but, uh, the cook is sick. That's fine then. We're celebrating, actually. All right. Yep, my son's getting married. Oh, wow. Well, nothing says wedding destination like Wellburg. Ah! - He grew up here. - Yeah. It's like one last bit of nostalgia before he takes that next big step in life. Hey, you know, you seem happier about it than he is. Ah, what can I say? Guess he knows what he's getting himself into. Yeah, it's true. Excuse me, gentlemen. - They're in position. - Good. Give them the go. And tell the other team to hit the house. And make sure they find anything they may have on me, and to keep him alive until I get there. I didn't read much of it. I just saw pictures of bodies and buzz words like nuclear codes. Are people coming here? Yes. What are we gonna do? It's my dad. Hey, Baby. You see, I forgot to tell you that the repairman is coming by. They're here. Yeah, I'll be there as soon as I can, yeah. Uh, yeah, give a kiss to the baby for me. - I will. - Thank you. Bye. Get your gun. Now! Honestly... I have seen worse. I mean, you were very good, very good. But these two? They preform like wet towels. Three entrances. Any others? Basement entrance comes out down the hall. Hailey, I want you to go upstairs, lock yourself in your room. And do not come out until I say it's clear. I'm not leaving you alone. Hailey, go! Let me go! Get off! Get up! Don't worry. I'll take care of your girl when you're gone. Hey. Baby. Hey, baby. Um... hey... she needs to know the truth... before she hears lies. Yes. I'm so sorry I didn't tell you this before. I'm sorry. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. Hmm, yeah? I, you know, I have trained you. And you have to listen to... To D now, all right? You understand me? I understand. You understand what I'm trying... good, good. Hide her. I will. You know they want her, right? Yes. Hey, Baby, you're... you're the best thing that ever happened to me. What's the word on the team that had the house? Not a thing. Okay, they're dead. I mean, maybe they're just waiting... Nah, they're dead. What about the spotters? They're in position now. Caleb's car's there, but no sign of him or Banshee. So they're holed up in the house waiting for us. What're you hearing? Our three are dead inside the tavern. And is there anything to link them back to us? Cops think it was a robbery gone wrong. They're trying to find the owner. How long before we get some backup? There's another team coming from the city now. They'll be here in three hours. Ugh, make sure they hustle. I want these assholes. - What if they run? - Where? There's only one way out of town. The spotters will see them. So now, we just sit back and we play the waiting game. What was it he wanted me to know? The truth about who he was. The CIA sent a man named Anthony to kill them. They said that they were traitors selling witnesses' intel to the Russians. Why would the CIA do that? They were getting old. They were too powerful, and they knew too much. Fuck! Caleb went into hiding. My father had been shot. And Anthony's brother had been killed. So Anthony will come here? I fucking hope so. Good. Do you have a plan? I'm working on one. Come with me. Will this help? He kept all these? He had trust issues. Lucky me. We should take the upstairs. It'll be to our advantage. My dad said if you aren't mobile, you're dead. Normally, that's true. But if we go anywhere, they'll find us. This house is our territory. It's advantageous to us. - Won't they just burn us out? - No way. They need Caleb's body as proof of kill. I have a price on my head, so they'll wanna collect that too. How many you got? Enough. Send them in. What was he really like? What? My dad. What was he really like? I think you probably knew him best. You just knew a different version of him. Which version did you know? I knew the big, strong, I'm-a-bad-ass Caleb. He had a hard shell, but... he had a soft spot for a few people. What was it like when you lost your parents? It was hard. I was angry. But I just kept my head down, focused on the work, and eye on the prize. So he really never mentioned us? No. Which means he loved you more than anything. He was protecting your safety even from the ones that he trusted the most. So you guess it's just us now? Yes. That's fine. Kinda like you. Kinda like you too. Why are they not getting out? Come here. What are you doing? They're using thermal. We need to register as one. Looks like the front door is boarded up. Walkie. Go around the back. Make sure it's the same. Roger that. Two guys across the yard. Back door's boarded up too. Did they just board it up and leave? All I'm seeing is one thermal image, so what the fuck are you talking about? Is there any sign of life downstairs? Negative. I'll go around back. Sir, what if it's a trap? Of course it's a trap. But I need to know who the second person is. Use this to find out before Caleb's on. It's time. Hey, Banshee! Little bitch! Little bitch! Time to play! Come on, Banshee. I know you're in there. D, don't worry about me! Kill this bastard! Banshee... are you really going to let your boy die? Do something. I can't. Anthony's the only one who knows about my father. Oh! Three more in the back. Go. Three going around back! They're coming in! Oh, fucking Christ! Rush the house! Rush the house! How's it going? Not great! Fucking useless. They keep kicking them before they go off! - Cook 'em. - What? Cook 'the grenades. I don't know what that means! Hold them for a few seconds before you throw them. One, two, three... You got a gun? You do now. Come on. Five or six coming in! - Eyes on Anthony? - I don't know! They're all wearing masks! Fucker's trying to wear us down. Go upstairs now. Fuck! Go. Go, go, go, go! Finally. Fuck off. Do you got any men left alive? I don't know. I think they're all dead. No, I can't do this. Of course you can. Listen to me. Who we find in that building, I want them alive. Are you serious? Yeah, I'm serious. Until I put them in body bags, I'm very serious. Go. Fuck. Whoa! Wow. Look at you, girl. Good job. Where's Caleb? Go, go, go! Where's Caleb? I have an idea. How about you get your fucking dudes off the girl? I'll tell you where Caleb is, you tell me where my father is, everybody's fucking happy. I don't recall where your father is. You're a liar. You know what? You're right. I do recall. The last time I seen him, there was a couple of guys beating the shit out of him. And he was lying in a pool of blood. Silly me. Get the fuck in here! Feels like a little much for a teenage girl! They never found a body. Or because your father's a traitor, and he ran away. Wrong. Get them off the fucking girl! Where's Caleb? Buried in the back yard. Now you're upsetting me because I know you're lying! 'Cause after Caleb shot my men, I know he came back here. Where the fuck is he? Oh, you're feeling tough? Okay. Let's do this old school. Shoot her! Shoot her! Yeah. Hey, hey, hey. Where... the fuck... is... Caleb? Huh? You punch like a little fucking bitch. Hey, asshole. Fuck you. Fuck. Are there more? I hope not. I got shot today. I got shot too. No. I got shot. In the shoulder. It's a flesh wound. You'll be okay. What's next? Are more people gonna shoot at us? Probably. It just depends on where we go and who we go after.
