[♪♪♪] [Leah] We are enjoying another beautiful day here in Conway, and it will continue on into Friday night, seeing as the slight risk of rain has blown off from the east, paving the way for lots of sunshine over the next few days. So, whatever your plans are, if it's spending the day with your family, or with that special someone, you'll be sure to have plenty of clear skies. Back to you, Bob! And... we're out! Thanks. Ahem. Hey! Chris? Great forecast. I wish I could have predicted that much sunshine. Uh, listen, I was thinking, that maybe I could help with the weather tracking? Put together some reports? I know that you are the network meteorologist, but, uh, I'd be happy to help. Thank you, Leah, but predicting the weather is a tricky science, one we've got to get right. So, we just need you to use that great on-air energy that we hired you for to tell our viewers if they'll need an umbrella or not, all-righty? Of course. Sunscreen or umbrellas. Oh! Maybe you could drop by the radar and have a look at the data, and then report back to me via text? That'd be super-helpful. You got it. Hey! Nolan, have you thought about where we might go tonight? Uh, actually, Leah, I'm really sorry, but Carson just got this great last-minute deal to Vegas, and it's kind of something I've always wanted to do, so, maybe you and I, we could go out another time, right? Yeah! Yes. It's Vegas. Cool. Okay, well, um... I gotta jet, so... Yeah. - Okay. - Yeah, totally. Cool. Hey. Vegas, baby! [dejected sigh] [thunder rolls and rumbles] Looks like we didn't get it right this time. Oh! You know, some may argue it's a little unhealthy to be checking your social media feed when out in nature. Well, thanks for the concern, but I'm actually checking the weather. The weather? On your weather app? Uh, no, not on my weather app. On that. It's a radar tower. It helps predict the weather. Well, when you got all this, you don't really need that. "All this"? Nature. All you gotta do is listen and watch carefully. Stay dry now. Come on, Brody! [Brody barks] "Nature"? Please. [♪♪♪] - Oh, ho, ho! - Yeah! Yes! Look, he's obviously not interested, Mom, if he's gonna bail on our first date. Look, I get that it's Vegas, but still. Well, don't worry. There'll be lots more opportunities. None of my relationships have worked out, and even my dating app is silent now. So, I've been thinking, and I've decided I'm not looking anymore. For the next year, I am only gonna focus on myself and my career. That is a great idea, 'cause we need someone to get these forecasts right. Exactly. So I'm gonna finish my degree, get my own place, and focus on nothing but winds, ocean currents, and weather systems. It's the year of Leah, Mom, and it's gonna be great. [Fiona] You never know what you'll find when you least expect it. [♪♪♪] [wind gusting] Oh! No, no, no! Shoot! Oh, thank you. That's not necessary. Thank you so much. That's so kind. Here you are, sunshine-- the usual. Aw, David, thank you. And a fresh cinnamon roll, on the house. That's great. Thank you. Have a nice day! - You too. Enjoy. - Thank you. Oh. Hi! I'm calling about your apartment for lease. Is it still available? Oh. [♪♪♪] [dog barking] [barking persists] [barking] [knocks five times] [dog barks five times] [knocks softly, twice] [barks twice] [knocks three times] [dog barks three times] [♪♪♪] [knock-knock-knock] [barking] [barking] [plays country music] [dog starts barking frantically] Oh! Okay, I get it. [light pop music plays, barking ends] Huh! What do you know? The mutt likes top 40. Okay. [♪♪♪] [loudly] Hello? Yeah! Yeah, that's right. Unit number nine! Okay! I'm gonna let you in! Bye! [knocks] Hi! Hey. Sorry to bother you. Is there any chance you could turn your music down? The walls are kind of thin in these units. Sorry. Uh... Hey! I know you. You're the guy from the park. That's your dog? I'm sorry, I put on the music because he was barking. Yeah. Yeah, that's, uh... I didn't recognize you at first, without your raincoat and the phone in your hand. Funny guy. So I've been told. I'm Mark, by the way. Leah. I'm sorry about Brody barking. He gets a bit unsettled when he's cooped up for too long. Well, lucky for you, he's a top-40 fan. Not so much country and, thankfully, not hard rock. Okay. Oh! And that's my chair. I take it you're just moving in? Yeah. You got it. Hey, uh, do you mind putting it up against the wall? Or not. Thank you! [laughs] Here, let me give you a hand. Least I could do, with the barking and everything. That would be great. You good to take an end? Uh, yeah. Yeah. Okay. [grunting] If we can just... Perfect! Look at that. Just fits. Great. So how long have you been living next door? Only a couple months. It's actually my friend's place, but he travels a lot for work, so Brody and I are just staying there for the year while I try out a new job. Although, maybe I should have left Brody back at the farm. You live on a farm? Born and raised. Wow. Wow, that's quite the setup. What are you, like, a meteorologist? Not yet. But, right now, you may know me as ARP's "weather girl at noon." I'm sure I would, if I watched TV to get my weather forecast, but... Right, the "nature" guy. Well, I hope you leave your home with an umbrella, because that folky stuff isn't exactly accurate. You'd be surprised. I'd go so far as to say that my "folky stuff" just might be more accurate than all that. I doubt that. But, anyway, thanks for the help, and I should get back to unpacking. I haven't even found a fork or a knife yet. Well, if you want, I got enough take-out to feed a barn, so you're welcome to join me, and I got lots of cutlery. It does smells good. Tastes better. You know what, that sounds really fun. Uh, yummy, I mean. Uh, you know, but I-- I shouldn't. You know, I have so much work to do, and studying and unpacking. Raincheck, then? Yeah. No pun intended. Yeah. Hey, uh, don't forget to put on some J-Lo, and Shakira, you know, on the radio, for the d... Brody, the dog. You know, when you're not home. Really? Could've sworn he was a Kenny Chesney fan. [chuckles] Thanks. Bye. [exhales deeply] Eye on the ball, Leah, eye on the ball. [Chris] I just don't know how we got it wrong. Every single satellite picture showed a shift to the west. [♪♪♪] [Nolan] Hey. Hey. Are we almost ready to roll? - Almost. Yeah. - Okay. Great. So... [chuckles awkwardly] You seem, uh, busy. Oh, yeah, sorry, I'm actually finishing my degree. Cool! Cool. School is cool. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Anyway, uh... Vegas was good. Oh, sorry, I meant to ask. Oh, no, that's okay. I mean, it was good and all, but... it wasn't worth canceling the date we had planned. You know what? It's all good. It got me motivated. Okay, well, I was thinking maybe, you know, we could give it another shot? You know what, Nolan? I'm actually not dating right now. Like at all, with anyone. And I have this exam I need to study for. Aw, shoot! I have to send a paper before I go on camera. - I'm so sorry. - Okay. Okay. [knock on door] Hey! Hi! Welcome to Chez Leah. Oh! Look at this place. What do you think? It's nice, right? It's lovely, sweetheart. Thank you. Knock-knock! Morning, neighbor. [Leah] Hey! Morning. I've got my music on for Brody. Good for you. Uh, Mom, this is my neighbor, Mark. Hi! - Hey, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. It's a beautiful day out there. It is. Take advantage of it while you can. It's gonna rain later. - Really? - Mm-hmm. 'Cause that's not what my satellite system says. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Smells like rain to me. Have a good one. [Leah] Bye! "Smells like rain." Please. Smells like the coffee I just made. Should we take it to go? - Sure. - Okay. First, you've got to show me the rest of this place. Oh, I know, I'm so excited for you to see. Oh! [♪♪♪] So, you know, I've been meaning to ask you about your very cute neighbor. Oh... What? I told you, I'm not dating right now, remember? I know, I know. I-I respect your decision. I just... don't think you should lean too far either way on the whole thing. I'm just saying, keep your eyes open. Always, 'cause you never know who you might meet. [man] Good evening, ladies. Because I have to say, there's an awful lot of men that are suddenly taking notice of you. Mom, please. Listen. I have to keep this commitment to being single and focusing on myself, you know? That's why I moved out, so that I could find myself. Plus, I am one credit away from getting my meteorology degree, and then Chris has to take me seriously. I understand. [man] Hello. But just remember-- when it rains, it pours. [thunder rumbles] Oh! Seriously? [thunder crashing] [♪♪♪] Hey. Need a hand? Uh, no, I-- I'm good. Is that why you thought no rain, was you didn't have batteries for your gadget? No. [chuckles] So, um, miss the farm much? Sowing all those fields. We're actually a dairy farm, but I'm not allowed to have cows in the city, so, this way, I can get my hands dirty. [laughs] So, uh, what's this new job you're trying out? Consulting for Drewer's Dairy. They think I can offer inside knowledge. Oh, that's got to be a change. You've no idea. I didn't even own a suit till two weeks ago. [chuckles] [Leah grumbles] [she sighs] May I? You know, when I was younger, I always wished that I grew up in the country, by fields full of windmills and satellites and... You know, growing up in the country teaches you how to predict the weather without using all these gadgets. All you got to do is just observe the crops, the wildflowers, and the animals. Thanks, but I think I'll stick to the science of it all. But thanks for the help. And, uh, good luck with the crops. [♪♪♪] [Leah, reporting] The sun is trying hard to break through those hazy clouds, but I don't think you'll be needing any sunscreen today, and keep those rain jackets close by. And... we're out. Hey, Chris! Guess what? so I am an official meteorologist. Congratulations, Leah. That's terrific. Good for you. I even have a whole weather station in my townhouse, so I can predict whatever comes our way. I can even work on some of those reports. Leah, I love your enthusiasm. I do. But it takes years of following weather patterns, collecting data... so get some experience, and then we'll take it from there. "Experience." Right. Okay. Got it. Oh, hey, that was a really awesome segment. Like, you really sold it. Thanks, Nolan. Well, I guess that's why they hired me. [chuckles] Hey, do you think I can borrow some of the station's weather equipment? Yeah, sure. Yeah. I could even get it for you, too. And then maybe after... You are so sweet, Nolan. Thank you. Okay. Oh... okay. ♪ Call, call me ♪ 'Cause I am the one ♪ I got a gift ♪ Or two Are those for Leah? Oh, yeah, but this one needs a signature. Oh, I can sign for them. I'm her neighbor.

[Leah] Hey! You left a note on my door about a delivery? A few, actually. Come on in. Oh, okay. Oh! Hey there, Brody. Hi, buddy. So is it your birthday, or...? No, it's not my birthday. Wait, are you saying that these are all for me? Uh-huh. Water? Uh, yeah, please. Okay. Oh, this is Ed. He's this guy that I just met that's been finding a spot right next to me at the park for lunch, recently. Yeah, and you know, it's weird, because he's there every time I am, oddly. We've become really good friends. Seems like you've got some male suitors. "Suitors." [snickers] No! This is probably just a housewarming gift. Because you're taken? Like, in a relationship, and men shouldn't be suitoring you? I'm definitely not in a relationship. Or "taken." And I'm certainly not interested in either of them. Because they're not your type or... whoa. Sorry. Let me back that up. It's none of my business. No. It's okay if you ask. I mean, if you want to know, I recently decided that I was going to strictly focus on myself and my career. Which is super-ironic, that I'm getting this much attention, because when I was looking for someone, trust me, none of this was happening. Well, you know what they say-- when it rains, it pours. That's what my mom always says. But hey, I can get onboard with your decision to do something different for a year. Look at me. We're kind of in the same boat. I guess we are. Are those cheesesticks? I don't know. Let's see. We've got... some red pepper jelly, chocolate almonds... and cheesesticks. Do you want one? Who could say "no" to a cheesestick? [laughs] Okay. There you go. Oh, and I think we're supposed to dip it into this. - Gotta love a gift basket. - Mm-hmm. [munching] Oh, yeah. Mm. So, um, what are you gonna do if your job doesn't work out? Go back to the farm, no regrets, because I gave it a shot. And as a extra bonus... I got to meet a really great neighbor. Well, I can't argue with that. Cheers... Cheers. To great neighbors... To great neighbors. [both chuckling] Mm! - It's better with the dip. - Yeah. We are now in week two of dai with no break in the wet forecast. Back to you, Bob.

Okay. I just thought it'd be different, exciting, you know, being in the city, working for a big corporation. Don't get me wrong. I am learning about a whole different side of the dairy industry. It's just... a year is seeming like a long time now. Did something happen? Nah. It's just my dad. I was FaceTiming him earlier. I think he's lonely. Mm. Yeah. You close with your folks? I am. So, who says you have to stick it out? I do. I made a commitment to give it a fair chance, even if I'm not a city boy. Yeah. [Brody barking] Oh! There goes Brody. Is he gonna come back? For the dinner bell or a ball. Come on. He's probably just trying to find something to herd. - Brody! - Brody! Hey, Brody! You can take the dog out of the farm, but you can't take the farm outta the dog. Can you blame him, with all these puddles? The city should really get some rain barrels, so that we can use this rain for good. That way, we can help everyone learn about climate and preservation. How do you get something like that going? Do we petition for it? Actually, that's exactly what we should do. And we could get an anemometer in one of the parks. Anem-what? Um, it measures wind speed. We can also set up a weather station for the kids, and they can learn about weather systems, and pressure, and climate. I mean, what do you think? I think I love your enthusiasm. It sounds great. I'm in. Well, you know, if the petition passes, you're gonna have to stay in the city longer, until it's finished. To hang out with you? - Yeah. - Until we get this done? Well, it's a win-win, both professionally and personally, 'cause, you know, I'd really like to have my friend and neighbor around a little bit longer. Then let's do it. So, once we get all the signatures, maybe we can bring it up at the next community council meeting. Rally up some more signatures and support. Wait, what? No flowers today? [Leah laughs] Oh, it's been a slow week. Maybe I can take care of that. Oh. There it is. [heavy rains pattering] But this weekend, you and I, we'll hit up the parks and start petitioning? You got it. Okay. Well, goodnight, Mark. 'Night, Leah. Thanks for cheering me up. That's what friends are for. [♪♪♪] Thank you for signing the petition. You'll see, it'll be worth it. Thank you. Got 50 signatures so far. Oh. Oh, ten phone numbers, I see, from a "Luke" and a "Jeffrey." It's not like I asked for them. Should we take a break? Oh, yeah, I'm actually starving. I think there's a food truck around here somewhere. Don't worry. I got it covered. What's this? Well, when you're working in the pasture all day, you make it a habit to bring along lunch, otherwise you lose time. But personally, I just prefer eating outside. I don't think this rain break is gonna last. Thanks. How are you so sure it's gonna rain again? Look up. See the birds flying? [Leah] Mm. Of course. That's your forecast. You see, birds will fly high during good weather, so you barely see them, but if there's disruptive air pressures, they fly low to avoid it, like when rain or a storm's coming. Where did you learn that? My grandpa. Taught me a lot, actually. Like about ants. You don't pay them much attention, but if you did, you'd notice that they build their anthills higher and steeper when rain's coming. Well, that's great, but if all it took were birds and bugs to predict the forecast, well, then I wouldn't need my new degree. You know, you can't beat science. You just have to work at it to get the forecast right, and I plan on being the best. I'm sure you will be. Just remember, Mother Nature can be unpredictable, but she'll always give you clues along the way. Like that, um, really big bug-- What? Where? Where? Right... [chuckling] Sorry! [woman] Mark? Rochelle. What are you doing here? I think I should be asking the diehard country boy that. I mean, you must be considered an outlaw back home. An outlaw? I love that. Oh, Rochelle, this is my good friend and neighbor, Leah. Hey! It's nice to meet you. And you. So, you live here now? Well, sort of. Temporarily, for now. Wow! I thought I'd never see the day that Mark Crawford would step foot off the farm. It's a trial run. [Rochelle] I see. Well, maybe you could tell me all about it the next time I'm in town. Yeah, for sure. Oh, here, I'll take your number. [app alert chimes] Sorry, that's my satellite. Excuse me. So where are you staying? Uh, Darren Frum's, actually. Darren, as in Darren, "mascot Darren," from high school? You got it. Well, tell him I said hi and I'll call you. It's really great to see you, Mark. - Yeah, you too. - Bye. Looks like there's no precipitation for the rest of the day. Sure about that? Right, about the birds. Well, like, I told you, it's all about science. So, uh, who's Rochelle? Oh, she and I went to the same high school. After she graduated, she went to college in Little Rock and decided to stay. It's only the second time I've seen her since she decided to move to the city. Oh, well, that'll be a nice catch-up, right? Yeah. Yeah, I guess so. [text alert chimes] Excuse me. It's the network. Chris is under the weather, and they want me to... go in and analyze the weather data. And I do the forecast tonight. That is my chance-- do you mind? No! No, go. I'll rally some more signatures. Although, I doubt I'll get as many phone numbers as you. Funny. I'll see you later. Thank you. You bet. A ridge of high pressure appears to be moving northeast overnight, so put away your umbrellas, Conway, because, by morning, you'll be smiling at the sun. [thunder rumbles] You've got to be kidding me. Looks like we got a bit of rain, huh? Thanks, Captain. You okay? [Brody whines] Aside from my forecast being completely off, I'm great. Well, you wouldn't be the first weather person to be wrong. I get that, but if I want to prove that I can be more than just a weather girl, I have to get it right. I mean, I can't get people's hopes up, especially farmers, whose fields are drowning from all this rain. Here. Why don't you take a break from all this... and come with us on a little road trip? [chuckles] It's Sunday, you don't have to be on the air, and this place has the ability to predict the forecast. Are we going birdwatching again? Because I'm gonna need something a little but more than that. No birds, but if it makes you feel better, you can bring along all your little gadgets and cell phone notifications with you. What do you say? Fine-- but there better be cell service. Of course. We hit the road in 20. Be ready. Okay. [♪♪♪] Where are we? Little spot I like to go fishing. Come on. Great. I just lost signal. Really? Must be something in the air. You knew I wouldn't have cell service here, didn't you? Would you have come if I'd told you? Maybe. I just need to stay on top of things. Trust me. You won't need all those readings today. Welcome to Pearson Pond. This? This is where I'm gonna learn about the forecast? I doubt if I'll catch more than a minnow here. Hey, don't knock it. There's more life in this pond than anywhere else I've fished. Here. You know what to do? I think so. So should I look up at the sky or the water? Nope. This time, all you gotta do is listen. What do you hear? The wind? And, of course, crickets. When I was kid, my grandpa was always the last to go out and check on the cows at night, and, of course, I always wanted to go with him, but I'd have to be up early the next day, so, before he went out, he'd ask me if he needed his jacket or not. He taught me to listen to the sound of the crickets and count the number of chirps in 14 seconds, and then add 40 to get the temperature. So I'd listen and count, and it was like counting sheep, so I'd get sleepy before bed. [laughs] Sounds like your grandfather was a pretty wise man. He was. Want to try it? All you gotta do is listen and count. Okay. One, two, three... [crickets chirping] 20, plus 40... Wow. That's really accurate. More accurate than science? Oh, I think I got something. Oh, ho! Okay... Oh, ho, ho! Yup, that is definitely a fish. [laughs] But if you love it... you set it free. [water splashing] Isn't that what they say? That's what they say. Cheese? You know it. You know what I love about you? You are always ready to eat. You always seem to have a stash of food somewhere. I can't help it. I get hangry if I don't eat when I need to, and you do not want to see that. Oh, I've seen it, my friend. Remember when you came home from that meeting that went late at work, and you hadn't eaten lunch? Yeah. I wish I would've had a cheesestick then. [both laughing] Amazing. We haven't even been neighbors that long, you already know all about me. Well, not everything. Like I didn't know you came here to fish. When do you come here? Actually, this is the first time I've been out here in a while. I figured if I wanted to give the whole city thing a chance, then I came out here, well, it'd be easy to fall back into my old ways. Does that make sense? It does. I guess it's kind of like if I decided to go on a date, you know, I might get sidetracked or lose focus. Which could happen, if it was a good date. Does that make sense? Yeah. Yeah, it does. [frogs begin croaking] Ah... there they are. [laughs] It kind of sounds like a rock concert. When it's gonna rain, they like to sound off louder than usual. Like a "ribbit" concert. Ahh. Hmm. No? Not feeling that one? It's pretty good. [♪♪♪] [Mark] Go on, boy. Be there in a minute. I can't believe how well-trained Brody is. I mean, he just waits for you there. Well, he did grow up on a farm, so. Yeah, that's true. Hey! Darren, buddy! How was Seattle? Surprisingly sunny. Did you bring any of that sunshine back with you? Darren, this is-- Leah Waddell! I know. When I'm home, I watch cable six. [laughs] It is a pleasure. - Yeah, hi. - So are you my new neighbor? I am, yeah! Well, then we'll have to have you over sometime, when I'm in town for longer than 24 hours. Sounds great, although I have spent quite a bit of time at your house already, so. Anyway, I'll let you two catch up, but have a good night. 'Night. [gate shuts] Oh! No, it is so not like that. Trust me. Leah Waddell! Wow. So there's really no chance at all with her? Nope. [Darren] Hmm. Well, maybe a little hard-to-get isn't a bad thing. I explained it to you already, Darren. It's not like that. I mean, she made the decision to be on her own for the year, and that's it. Or until she meets the right man, which could be you. I can't be that guy. Why not? There were sparks between you two, I saw it. Admit it, bro. We're friends. Just friends! That's what you saw. That easy camaraderie and-- Mm-mm, except men and women don't have that. Do you seriously still believe that men and women can't be buddies, because one or the other always wants more? Because that is Neanderthal. Between you and Leah? I believe it. More specifically, I know you want to be more than friends. Oh, I gotta jet. Look, just keep me posted on all this, okay? 'Cause I'm really curious to see where all this camaraderie leads to by the time I get back. [guys laughing] [♪♪♪] [Leah] Good thing I got plenty of water in my rain barrels. Oh, mine are overflowing, too. - Really? - Yeah. Knock-knock. Grabbed those muffins from your coffee-man admirer. Oh. Oh, here, let me help you with that. Yeah, just hold it steady. Perfect... Thanks. Uh, Dad, this is my neighbor, Mark. Mom, you remember Mark? [Fiona] Yeah, nice to see you again. And you. And I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. - Oh. - Not at all. Those muffins smell good. Oh, yeah, please, help yourself. Blueberry. Leah's favorite. Uh, so Mark is in the city for a new job. Really? What's that? Consulting, for Drewer's. - The dairy people? - Mm-hmm. That's right, and his family owns a dairy farm. [Fiona] Oh, that's interesting. You know, when Leah was little, she always wanted us to move to the country. I'm pretty sure she's a country girl at heart. Well, she sure knows how to fish. That's my girl, all right. Well, I should leave you to your visit, but it was a pleasure seeing you again, and it was a pleasure meeting you. Well, please don't leave on our account. I appreciate that, but I actually have to get my dog out before he chews through the drywall. [laughter] Thanks for the muffins. No problem. Mom. Don't. What? The man just walks right in. Uh, that's because we've become good friends. And he knows what I'm trying to do, because he's doing the same thing. And what's that? Not dating? No. Maybe. Well, I don't know. What I meant is that he's focused on his new job for a year, just like I'm focused on my career for a year. I'm just glad there's someone close by who can look after you. I don't need anyone to look after me, Dad, but I know what you mean. Yeah. Now, Fiona, the first pitch is in 30 minutes. I know, I know. Honey. I baked you a lasagna. Mom, thank you. You're welcome, sweetie. I miss cooking for three. Mm, yeah, it's remarkably hard to cook for one. Well, then cook for two. - Bye! Love you! - Love you, too. Go, team, go! - Whoo! - Whoo! [laughs] [thunder rumbling] Oh, no. [♪♪♪] So, any good news in the forecast? Well, other than a bit less humidity, not really. Oh. I'm sorry that I predicted all that sun when you were under the weather-- no pun. That's all right. We've both been wrong. But I've been working really hard, and I've learned a lot about weather predictions. That's good, because if you can predict when this weather's going to end, you just may find yourself doing more than our midday forecasts. You mean, I... I would be working with you? As one of our network meteorologists, yes. That would great. It will be... if you can figure out when we'll see the sun again. [♪♪♪] [exhales deeply] Thank you, Mom. Mm! [controls beeping] [♪♪♪] [smoke alarm blaring] Oh! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Oh! [beeping] No! Hey! What's going on? It's a lasagna. Is that what that is? Can you just... - Yeah. - Please. [alarm stops] Thank you. So I take it that was dinner? And breakfast and lunch. Well... I'm on way to visit my dad. Why don't you come with me? He always cooks more than he needs. I don't-- I don't know. I should probably just order a pizza so I can keep tracking this weather system. Actually, I just happen to know the best place to track that. And why am I not surprised? Does that mean you're coming? Look, I don't want to intrude on your dad. My dad runs a farm. He's used to the unexpected. And in case you're wondering, we do get wi-fi up there. Scout's honor. [♪♪♪] Ah, there he is. Hey, Dad. And you! You rotten scoundrel. Ohh! City teaching you to behave? Hardly. Ah! And who's this? Oh, Dad, this is my new neighbor in the city, Leah Waddell. It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Crawford. Only the tax man calls me "mister," so unless you're working for the I.R.S., you call me Dean. All right, then. Dean. Good! Now I know you're not gonna audit me. Come on and I'll get y'all a drink before Mark shows you around. Okay. [Leah] Your dad's a real character. [Mark] Yeah. He's one of a kind. Just like all us Crawford boys. You know cows can help you predict the weather, too? Really? Yeah. See how they're all moving around? Yeah? Because the rain's coming again. Well, rain is better than drought, I guess. Actually, too much rain can be just as bad for farming as not enough. Rots the vegetables on the vine, drowns the roots, and makes it harder to harvest. Even make it harder for these old girls to graze, so too much rain can't be good for anyone who makes their living off the land. I bet. It's Mother Nature's way of reminding us to respect what she provides, because if we don't, times like these will only get worse. Hmm. Huh. Guess the cows were right. Come on. This boy had every single worker out in that field, playing baseball, using their bare hands! Until that Christmas, when Dad bought all the hands on the farm gloves-- and that's when we started our own little farm league. But we only played games after all the work around here was done. That's amazing. So do you still play? Well, not so much since we lost our pitcher. But a man's got to forge his own path. And there's always gonna be baseball. Well, you know, I come from a long line of baseball fans. Ah, so no wonder the two of you get along so well. You got anything else in common? Ah, there's a few things. In fact, your son is teaching me a lot about the weather. [chuckles] Yep. Doesn't take a lot of learning to see it's pretty soggy around here. - Mm. - How bad is it? Well, it'd be nice if the rain let up for a spell. We could use a good week, at least. You got a dry spell in the forecast for us? [chuckles] Judging by those cows, no, I'm sorry. Well, the weather will turn, sooner or later. Always does. [Leah] Thanks for letting me join you. Oh, heck, it's refreshing to have a beautiful face around the table again. Not that us Crawford men aren't handsome enough, but, ah, we get tired of seeing the same mugs, so please, you come again, any time. I will. Thank you. Goodnight. Dad, you let me know if you need any help around here, all right? Don't you worry about that, son. We got plenty of hands. You just give that job of yours a chance, because, from where I'm standing, the city's looking pretty good. All right, Dad. Thanks. Goodnight. Don't be a stranger. [♪♪♪] [thunder rumbling] [Leah] Thank you. Home, sweet home. [Leah sighs] - [Leah sighs] - [Mark] What is it? Ah, nothing. It's just... it was so great being in the country. Well, good thing I brought a little back then. To make up for that slow week. [inhales deeply] The scent is so strong. It's all the moisture in the air. What's this? Another one of your admirers? [chuckles] Our petition was accepted by the city council. So we're getting a rain barrel? They're giving us everything that we asked for. That's great! But they can't start until next year, because they don't have enough crews. That's a long time from now. What if we recruited people in the community to help get it done? I built a barn that way, and built ten acres of fencing, so that... will be a walk in the park. Really? You would want to? Sure I would. Okay. Yeah, let's do it. Let's make this happen! [laughing] Oh, uh, I don't want to crush the flowers. I should probably put them in water. Yeah. Yeah, right. For sure. Yeah. Okay, well... yay, we won! Mm-hmm. I'll, uh, see you tomorrow? Yes, you will. Okay. Great. Well, goodnight, Mark. Goodnight, Leah. [♪♪♪] We're gonna need as many hands as possible, so thank you, and we'll see you then. Thanks. Hey... Hey. I hear you're recruiting for a park project? We are. We're gonna need lots of hands for hooking up giant rain catchers, windmills-- Say no more. I'm in. Okay, and then maybe afterwards we could finally grab that drink or... Uh, yeah-- Hey, Leah. You might want to see this. - Oh. Thanks. - Yeah. Wait. This can't be right. What can't be right? Chris's forecast states a break in the rain. Well, that's a good thing, though, isn't it? Yeah, only if it's true. That's a good one. I like that. Uh, hey, Chris? Excuse us. That's good news in the forecast. Too bad you didn't catch it. Actually, I don't think that it's right. Really? Based on what? Because not just me, but all the other news outlets are reporting clear skies in a few days. So, what have you got? Actually... I got it from Mother Nature. Please, don't tell me you're being serious right now. [chuckles awkwardly] Well, actually, I am. Chris. Listen. I want to forecast sunshine. I do! But... I'm sorry, I just don't think that's gonna happen. Not yet. Please. I think I'm right about this. [Chris] I'm sorry, Leah. The science says sunshine. That's what we follow here. [Leah] Well, no sign of sun yet. At least I showed my boss I know what I'm talking about. Thanks to you. It seems that science and nature are a winning combination. Hey! You made it. Hey, hey, hey! Uh, Nolan here is the one who makes sure that the camera always gets my good side. Except all your sides are great, Leah. Oh. So you two, uh, work together? [Leah] That we do. Hey, Nolan, do you mind taking charge of the barometers? Of course. I'm on it. [Leah] Thank you. [chuckles] He seems nice. Yeah, he's a good guy. Good guy that you've ever dated? I was supposed to go on a date with him, but I didn't. Why? Uh, well, he ended up going to Vegas, actually. But it was great, because that's the moment I decided to focus on me. Right. So when "the year of Leah" is over, do you think you and Nolan are gonna make up for that date? Uh, I don't know, I haven't really thought about it. What I have been thinking about, though, is that how great my life has been going these past few months. You know, no men, no dating, no heartbreak, which has made me feel a lot more confident and good about myself, so that's nice. I mean, who knows, I might just stay the course after this year is over. Really? Yeah, I... look how much I've accomplished so far. Aside from not feeling the feels of failed relationships, I got my degree, and my field work is more accurate every day, and all this, right here. [thunder claps] Oh! [laughing] Just in time! [phone rings] Is everything okay? Yeah, it's, uh... it's Rochelle. She's gonna be in from Little Rock tomorrow and wants to meet up. Oh. Are you gonna go? Yeah, I think it would be good to catch up, and I'm not "not dating" like you, so. Oh, so it's like a date more than a catch-up? I didn't say that. I'm just not saying no. Like you. Well... I hope you have fun. Well, I'm gonna go help out with the cloud display, but you can hold on to that. I got this. See you later. [♪♪♪] [thunder crashing] I don't care if he's going out with Rochelle, because he's just a friend. A really good friend, and it's just I worry about him, as a friend, And what are you worried about? Well, he's vulnerable right now. He doesn't know if he should stay in the city, or go back to the farm, and who knows? She could influence that. He did say she always wanted to be in the city. So you don't think he should stay in the city? No. I... I would love for him to stay, because, you know, he's such a great neighbor, of course, but he's clearly a country boy. Well, it sounds like he needs to figure out what's best for him, like you're doing. ♪ There's my birthday girl Dad, don't age me. It isn't for another week. But you did make a reservation at Mallory's? Of course. Table for three. Just like every year. Why change a good thing? [Rochelle] So you're living in the Hartford complex. Unit five. I actually just sold a unit in one of their latest developments in Little Rock. So business is good? Can't complain. You know, Brody looks a lot like your old dog, Chase. That's because Brody's got the same mom. It was her last litter, and Chase was getting older, so I thought a new pup would help keep his spirit young. Aww. Chase was a good boy. And Brody seems to be pretty well behaved. Well, that's actually thanks to Leah, who figured out that music mellows him out during a rainstorm, and she gets him out to the park when I'm working late. And, actually, she's created this whole outdoor weather station. It's amazing, really. Leah? This is the neighbor I just met? That's the one. And you two are just friends? That we are. Well, I think it's great to see you in the city. And to be honest, it seems to suit you, and Brody. I mean, I know you said you'd never leave the farm, but here we are. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] - Hey. - Oh! Oh. Hey. What are you doing? Ah... nothing. I thought I heard Brody. And there he is. So I must be hearing things. But, uh... hey! How was your catch-up? With, uh, Rochelle? It was good. Great... Great. Uh, well, I'm gonna go check on my radar. There's been a lot of activity in the miles around here. So I'll, uh, catch ya later, skater... neighbor. See you. [phone alert chimes repeatedly] Is your dating app? No. Um... The storm front I'm following has gotten really big. I don't know why, but... that look scares me. Well, there's nothing to be afraid of. Unless you, uh, don't like chasing storms. What do you think, Brody? Like chasing storms? [chuckles] [♪♪♪] [Leah] This is perfect. Not too close, but close enough to get the perfect view. Is it coming towards us? Mm. Thankfully not. [Mark] That is one big storm. [Leah] Yeah. Beautiful yet terrifying, all at the same time. Yeah. You know, when I was a kid, I, uh, used to wake up at night when a storm blew in. Not because I was scared, but I would get out of bed, and lay on my bedroom floor so I could get a perfect view through the window of the storm. Just like the old days then-- except I'm willing to bet the view from here might be even better. So, Mr. Snack Man, what do you got for me today? - Funny you should ask. - Mm? How about... a half-eaten bag of slightly-stale potato chips? That is perfect. Thank you very much. Mm. Perfectly stale. Right? A storm always makes my hair stand on end. Yeah. Mine too. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [app alerts chiming] [alerts continue chiming] [♪♪♪] [knocking] ♪ It's your "bear-thday" ♪ And you know what they say Thank you, George. Have a nice day. Again. [sighs] [knocking] Just leave it on the doorstep! Oh. Thank goodness, it's you. Wow. Did all the bachelors in the city find out you were unavailable indefinitely? It's my birthday. How did I not know that? Uh... I mean... even your coffee vendor, David, figured it out. Well, that's because you get a free coffee on your birthday. And flowers, apparently. [Leah's dad] Knock-knock! - [overlapping] Hey! - Happy birthday! Thank you. What is all of this? Well, it is my birthday. Now, on normal days, she only gets half as many deliveries. Really? Well, you know what they say. When it rains, it pours. I know. Mark, seeing as you're here, why don't you join us? We're taking Leah for her birthday dinner at Mallory's. It's where we celebrate all the Waddell birthdays. I don't want to intrude, if it's a tradition. Don't be silly. We'll just make it for four. Yeah, it's settled. And we should hurry. We don't want them to run out of their clam chowder. They make a fresh pot every day, and when it's gone, it's gone, so if they have it, you really have to try it. All the other kids had run inside already, but not this one. Fiona was outside, screaming like Auntie Em in The Wizard of Oz, except, instead of "Dorothy," she was yelling "Leah! Leah!" [all laughing] Finally, we saw her, strolling down the street, looking up at the sky, head in the clouds, as usual. You would've loved growing up on the farm then, 'cause we got some epic storms out there. Oh, I know she would've loved that. Well, they couldn't have been any bigger than the ones we saw on our storm-chasing tour, right, Dad? I don't think so. Storm-chasing tour? I still can't believe you actually went through with that. Can't go back on a birthday promise. When Leah turned six years old, I foolishly promised that, in ten years, if she was still that interested in the weather, I would take her on this tour. Biggest rookie-Dad mistake I ever made. [laughter] - Dad, it wasn't that bad. - What? Your father told me that when he saw those storm clouds, he wanted to jump out of the van. - [laughter] - Yeah, call me crazy, but I think that there is something inherently wrong with driving into a storm, instead of away from it. Yeah, I could see that, if you don't like chasing storms. Yep, kind of makes my hair stand on end. In a good way. So, Mark, how is your job going? Ah, it's all right. I mean, I thought I'd shared everything I know about dairy farming, but they seem to think I have more to offer, so they've asked me to stay on, more permanently. Really? Well, congratulations. Thanks. Are you gonna stay on more permanently? I don't know yet. I'm a bit torn right now. I mean, the city does have a lot to offer, of course, but the farm... well, that's where my heart is. But the city is growing on me. Ahh! Yeah! [Dad laughing] [Leah] Mom, Dad. What? It is tradition, and you are never too old for that. Happy birthday, Dorothy. Make a wish. [overlapping] Yeah! - Thank you. - Happy Birthday, honey. Mwah! Goodnight! - Goodnight. - Thank you! - Love you! - You too, honey. - Happy birthday, sweetheart. - Thank you! [Leah chuckles] That was fun! How was the clam chowder? It was actually really good. Yeah. I'm happy there was some left. [Mark] Yeah. Um... Thanks. For what? For being a sport and coming to dinner. Actually, I was planning on coming by tonight, to see what you were doing, so I could give you this. I thought you said you didn't know. Of course I knew! You have it circled in bright red on your calendar. Mark, they're beautiful. Just like you. And they're not just pretty on the outside. You see, with daisies, when rain's on its way, the petals will close up so not a single drop gets in. And when the sun's coming, well... they smile at it. So in a way, they're like... nature's rain predictor. It's the perfect gift. Well, I'd have to say stormchasing's pretty awesome, but, yeah, it's a close second. Happy birthday. And, uh, hey... when's your birthday? Friends should know that. October 7th. Ah. A Libra. Now I get it. Get what? Goodnight. 'Night. Hmm. [Brody whines] I'm telling you, bro. She "gets it" because you always weigh your options. You know, Libra, sign of the scales. Like with this whole work thing, you won't make a rushed decision-- or with her. You know, is she just a friend? Isn't she? Should I ask her out? Shouldn't I? We are just friends. Her decision, which, by the way, is going on indefinitely now. So then, you have nothing to lose. What do you mean? If you ask her out, she's either gonna say no, or break her resolve and say yes. But I have everything to lose, Darren. I mean... if I ask her out, that'll be it. It'll completely change everything-- our whole dynamic, our whole friendship. So what are you gonna do? I guess I wait until she's ready. And when she is, I just have to hope that I'll be the one. And if you're not, you've wasted a lot of time, my friend. If I were you, I would just start dating. Maybe give this whole Rochelle thing another shot. I mean, you two do have history. I don't know. This sounds like a bad idea, somehow. Trust me. A distraction right now is exactly what you need. [♪♪♪] Ooh! Hot oven! Where're you flying to next? Chicago. Big trade show. All right, bud. Next time you're in town, we gotta go to this awesome pizza place called Marco's. Wait a minute. You know about Marco's? Best pizza in the city. [chuckling] Wow! Look at you. You are settling in. We'll make a big city boy out of you in no time. [Mark] Okay. Hi, guys! Rochelle. What are you doing here? Well, Darren actually called me-- Since high school! It's been so long! Wow. Rochelle. You-- I haven't seen you since you and Mark were, you know... and, clearly, I'm guessing you're here to see him, and sadly not me. Right? So. Right. But you called me? [chuckles awkwardly] Okay. Uh... well, your place looks amazing. Hey, if you're free, Mark, did you want to grab a coffee and catch up? I would love to, but I was actually just heading out to run some errands. But he'll be free later. Maybe we could have dinner. Later. [Darren] Sounds great! And I'm flying out of town, so the place'll be yours. I can make your favorite, veggie pot pie. I'd need to be in your kitchen a little bit earlier. No problemo! Here, take my key. Um... perfect. I'll grab what I need this afternoon and head over and start prepping. - Yeah. - Fabuloso! So good to see you again, Rochelle. You too. Oh, hey. Make sure you take care of my guy, okay? [slaps Mark's back] I will. And I'll see you later. Bye. Good old Rochelle. Really? What? She was in the neighborhood. [♪♪♪] [Leah] Knock-knock! Oh, hey there, Brody! Oh. You listening to some new music today? So, those, uh, daisies you got me-- I swear one of them is a little bit droopy, but I co-- Oh. I'm sorry. I-I didn't realize-- Leah, right? That's right. And... and you're Rochelle. In the flesh. Mark gave me a key so I could make one of his favorite dishes-- [overlapping] Vegetable pot pie. Yeah. Right. So Mark tells me you two are good friends. That we are. So, what do you think? Apple or berry crumble? Uh... apple. [laughs] That's what I thought. I just wasn't sure if his taste buds had changed. You know, if you need him right now for anything, he's actually not home. Oh! Uh, right. I-It wasn't important. I'll talk to him later. Great. I'll tell him you stopped by. Great. Well, so I'll just head out. I'm just... - Bye. - Bye. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] So what do you think? Everything's tasted amazing so far. Yeah, well, I did remember that veggie pot pie and apple crumble were your favorites. Yep. And just so you know, this was all Darren's idea, to get together. Darren and ideas-- he's full of 'em. [both laughing] That reminds me-- remember when we were in high school and Darren pranked the school office and replaced the national anthem with-- what was it? Alvin and the Chipmunks. Yes! That was it! Oh, the looks on those teachers' faces. [both chuckling] [♪♪♪] This is so nice. Being out here, it reminds me of when we used to hang out on your back porch. [Mark] Except you can't see as many stars. You know, even on a clear night. [door creaks softly] You know, I can't tell you what it felt like to see you again after all these years. It felt like... a bit of home. [planter crashing] Leah? Is that you? Uh, yep! Yup. Yeah, yeah. [forced chuckle] Hey! Uh, I was just out here, checking, uh... barometric pressure and temperature... whoo! But, um, yeah, it's looking really good, so, um, anyway, I'm just gonna go back inside, but hope you guys have a great time. Okay. [sighs dejectedly] [♪♪♪] Maybe I should've offered her some dessert. She's on her own, so... Right. So, I was saying how nice it was to see you again. Hmm? Oh! Yeah, it's been great. You know, maybe I could pack some up for her. You know, she could have it when she wants. Right. You know she stopped by earlier, your neighbor. She did? Yeah. She didn't say it was anything important, but it was funny, 'cause it took me by surprise when she just walked right in. Oh, yeah, we actually don't really knock anymore. It's been great. It's like we live in one big townhouse, instead of two. I see. Mm-hmm. [♪♪♪] You know, this was really great, just to catch up with an old friend. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it was. Thank you-- for the veggie pot pie and the excellent apple crumble. Well, I still have a bit of country roots left in me. Yeah. I should probably get going. Oh. Okay, well, I'll walk you to your car. Oh, no, no, no, no. No, I'm just parked out back. Sit. Goodnight, Mark. You take care of yourself, okay? And Mark, don't forget. We were friends first, too. It's the best place to start. [♪♪♪] Hmm. I don't know, Dad, maybe I'm wrong. Yeah, I thought they were good enough to make the playoffs, too. No, I mean... being focused on my career. What if the right man doesn't want to wait for me? Or I miss my chance, or whatever? Does this have to do with your neighbor, Mark? Because your mom seems to think that something's going on. Mark? Pfft. No. - Mm. - No way. I... We're just friends. So, no. Besides, he's been spending time with an old girlfriend, so... no. I was thinking maybe Nolan, from work. He's been trying to do a redo date since Vegas, so. Nolan? Yeah. Dad! Dad! What are you doing? The bases are fully loaded. I know I told you to keep your eye on the ball, and you have been. You gotta play the field, you gotta cover all your bases, and when you're finally ready to take a swing again and step up into the batter's box, just make sure that you're batting for someone who's great for you. Someone who, you know, uh, makes you feel like you're both playing for the same team. Dad, that's the most confusing baseball analogy I've ever heard. Yeah, I got nothin'. [♪♪♪] [knocks] Guess she's not home. Let's go. [background chatter, indistinct] Here. Thanks. All right. Okay. [Nolan exhales deeply] - How's this table? - Uh, looks fine. - Yeah? - Yeah. Okay. - I, uh... - Thanks. ...can't deny I was a little surprised that you wanted a redo on this date. Well, it only seems fair. Yeah, yeah. Sure. But it's just you didn't really seem that interested, not that I was gonna stop trying or anything, 'cause-- Mm. [chuckles] Yeah. Uh... right. Yeah. Hey. Did you know that you can tell the weather with how low or high birds are flying? Wow, that is kind of cool, I guess. And crickets-- they can tell you the temperature. How awesome is that? Do you know what? I tried crickets. In Vegas. It was like a dare, right? But you know what? They weren't even that bad. They were chili-lime. They were deep-fried. Everything's good deep-fried, right? Yeah. So tell me, Nolan. What path are you on? Like, what's your journey? Well, um, I don't really have any trips planned right now. No, I-I mean, are you happy where you are? Like, at work? Living in the city? Are you trying other things, pursuing other things? Broadening your horizons? Mm. No. No, not really, actually. I'm a pretty happy guy. I mean, working at the station is-- kinda like you. We have a really good situation, so it's kind of perfect, right? Uh, well, not really. I've-I've been broadening my horizons. Remember? With my degree. Right. Right. No, yeah. Of course. [gasps] They have butter chicken here. Amazing! I got it, by the way. My degree. Well, that's cool. That's cool Oh! Oh, yeah. Um, do you like basketball? Because I did pick this place because of all the TVs. They will through the game on every single TV, if you ask. It's about to start, too! [forced chuckle] Well, that was fun. Yeah, it was nice. Yeah. Come on, boy. Hey. Mark. Hey! What are you, uh, what are you two up to? Something for work, or-- It's a make-up date. Leah gave me a second chance, so. She did? Well, that's, um... that's something, all right. Yeah. Well, I just figured why be so rigid about it all, so. Yeah, well, I'm, uh... glad you've come to see it that way. So I won't keep you two. I'll see you. Mark! The daisies, they're drooping. Because rain's coming. Right. Goodnight. Bye. So, um, wanna go get that ice cream, or...? Sure. Yeah? Let's go. [Darren, on phone] You sure you're ready to go back? I mean, just like that? I mean, you were ready to spill your guts. Honestly, Darren, I knew this job wasn't for me months ago, so why wait it out? Don't tell me "because of Leah," because she clearly doesn't feel the same way about me. I mean, she finally decides to break her commitment, and the first person she goes on a date with is that Nolan guy. Yeah, I'm sorry, bud. Yeah, well, I gave it all a shot, didn't I? So...
