PURITY. BACK THEN, THESE SNAKES WERE BORN INTO AN ENVIRONMENT WITH VERY LARGE MAMMALS. SO THE DIAMONDBACKS THAT HAVE DEVELOPED A RATTLE HAD A BIG ADVANTAGE OVER THOSE THAT DIDN'T. THEY DIDN'T GET STEPPED ON. Girl: YOU MEAN SUDDENLY OUT OF NOWHERE, A BABY SNAKE WAS BORN WITH A BIG RATTLE? THE PREVAILING THEORY IS THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN WITH AN INCIPIENT-- PRIMITIVE. THANK YOU, RYAN. RATTLE-LIKE MUTATION THAT WOULD HAVE DEVELOPED OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF EVOLUTION, BUT WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE. GOT THAT RIGHT. Woman: IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE THAT IT HAPPENED EXACTLY AS YOU SAID AND THAT ONE DAY, A BABY DIAMONDBACK WAS BORN WITH A FULLY FORMED MUTATION THAT JUST HAPPENED TO BE EXTREMELY BENEFICIAL TO ITS SURVIVAL. DOES THIS SEEM IRRELEVANT TO ALL OF YOU? BECAUSE IT'S NOT. NOW, I KNOW A LOT OF YOU SUBSCRIBE TO OTHER THEORIES, BUT HOWEVER YOU THINK THIS WAS ALL SET IN MOTION, IT'S ABOUT YOUR LIFE.
