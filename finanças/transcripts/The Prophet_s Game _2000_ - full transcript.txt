God, why are you punishing me? With red on his head, he uses a gun. With green on his chest, he uses a sword. Who is it? Joey, we're not supposed to be playing the prophet's game. Adele! What? "With red on his head, he uses a gun... With green on his chest, he uses a sword." - what's the answer? - I don't want to get in trouble. Come on, he's not here. Elizabeth Taylor. No, dummy. It's a man. Oh. John Wayne? No, Errol Flynn. Remember "Robin hood"? "Custer"? Red player, you've missed too many questions. You're out of the game. Don't be a baby, Adele. You can still be the blue player, and the green player. I don't like this game. It's too hard. No, it's not. Come on, keep playing. Joseph Matthew Highsmith, what did I tell you about that game? I told you to throw that thing away, didn't I? - Didn't I?! - Yes, sir. What's it doing out? I just... You thought you was gonna get away with something. - didn't you?! - No, sir. Don't sit there and lie to me, boy. I'll skin you alive. Stop it, or I'll give you something to cry about, Missy. Give me that game. Give it to me! When I tell you to do something, you better damn well do it! You think you're smart, hiding this from me? You think nobody's watching you? God is watching you! He's judging you for your sins... For this... What the hell is this? What is it? Idolatry, sir. "Thou shalt have no other god before me." And this thing, it's evil. Nothing but evil will ever come of it. This is it. It's over. No more! No, stop it! You're killing them! You're killing them! I hate you! I hate you! Why, you little...! Mommy, make him stop! Joseph... he's been hurt! Let me go and look at him! Do not coddle that boy, Rose. You're gonna lead him on a path straight to hell! No! He's a good boy, Joseph! It is your boy, Rose, your boy. He's a goddamned monster, and everyone knows it. And everyone knows what he did to that dog. No! He didn't do that. He killed him, Rose. He killed him. He cut him into pieces, and stuck his head on the fence post. Your boy. Your boy, Rose. No, it's not true! What the hell is he gonna cut up next, huh? I just wonder what he's gonna cut up next. I'm gonna get you! You better hurry... Hurry, hurry! You better hurry... You better hurry... uh-oh... Where did she go? Where is she, now? Oh, oh, oh... I got you! I got you. Just a second, honey. What's the matter? Oh, Vincent... Oh, my god. Do grandpa a favor... Pick up all your toys before daddy gets here, all right? - okay. - Okay. I'm gonna see grandma. ♪ Flashback...

I'll call you back, okay? Bye-bye. Who is it? Messenger. I have a package for... Luna Wells? Hello? The game has begun. Who is this? The time may have dulled your mind, detective, but surely you remember me. Did you get my postcard? Look, I don't know what kind of joke you're trying to pull here... You don't believe? Luna Wells does. You may went to send someone to fetch her. - she's ruining the carpet. - Who the hell is this? You'll have to find me for the answer. You know where to begin. I'll have them leave the light on for you. Los Angeles. I need the number of the police department. I'm standing at the front yard of the murder victim's home. The LAPD has not yet commented on the situation, but one thing is for sure... Luna Wells' murder could not have happened at a worse time for them. A recent report alleged corruption and incompetence within the department, and resulted in the removal of police chief Michael Devein, and several other top ranking personnel. This has been a very tragic evening. This is Carol Stone, Kady. Back to you, Frank. Yeah, we're watching the news now. - He left us your number. - My number? - it was on her arm in blood. - Oh, no. Why would he do that? I don't know why he would leave my number. We had a series of these murders a few years ago, but... We got the guy. The number belongs to a guy in Seattle. - He's a retired detective. - What's the connection? He was the guy that brought down that serial killer a couple of years ago. "Little Jack"? Yeah. He seems to think we've got a copycat. He thinks? You know the story, chief. We don't exactly have all of Luna Wells down in the morgue. I don't want anyone to find out about it, either. - Not until we're ready. - I understand. I don't want to be judged on how you handle this, Walter. This isn't going to turn into some feeding frenzy for the press. I want this handled quickly and quietly. Yes, sir, we're on top of it. I've got the lab analyzing trace evidence from the scene, and we're checking to verify if she filed any reports having to do with crazed fans or ex-boyfriends. You're not going to let me down, Walter. I'm the only reason you're still here. Chief. Yeah, what is it? Captain, these just came in from Seattle. It gets worse. It's not him. Alan, why are we not registered at Robinson's? Did I or did I not give you a list of things to do two weeks ago, and asked you to do it? Yes, but listen... just protract the facts, all right? I was going to go down there and register with them, but Renee said I could register online. Uh-huh. What did you do with that information? Nothing. Look. You don't want to get married? Fine. - Barb, I'm doing it. - Fine. With me. Barb, I'm doing it. I'm doing it. Barb, now, honey, come here, sweetheart. It's all right. Just calm yourself down. Have a seat here. I say uncle Lew's going to take real good care of you. What do you want? Nothing, nothing, you just relax. Barb... Barbstress... - Luna Wells. - I know nothing. Come on, Barb, come on. Did you see her? What did he do to her? - I'm not telling. - Come on! - Barb, come on. - I can't. Do you promise not to tell a single soul? Yes! Oh, Lewis, you are such a liar. I love it when you do that. - He cut off her foot. - Ohh! Ooh! But you did not hear that. That has not been released to the press... Lewis! - Alan...? - What? - I don't hear you typing. - I've got to check my email. See if I got my next clue for "the prophet's game." By the way, Lewis, you owe me 20 bucks. You missed 6 questions, and you're out of the game. We are so headed for a divorce. Wait a minute. Wait a cotton-picking minute. What did you do, make a bet with the other players, too? You're not getting 20 bucks from me. You're the prophet, that's why you keep getting all the answers right. Yeah, the loser's always suspicious, isn't he? I did not get them all right. I missed just this last one, so did green, we were tied. You, on the other hand, are out, and you owe me 20 bones. I'm not paying you 20 bones. I'm not paying. It was not an official bet. I didn't even want to play in the first place. I don't even know anything about famous dead people, which I clearly stated when we started this. Besides, I know this is a scam. Oh, yeah! Yeah, it's you and Lyle, isn't it? No, I'm telling you, I don't know who the prophet is. Well, it's obviously somebody here on campus. I mean, you're posting all the answers on the board. Why don't you just email them back? Yeah, Alan, why don't we just email them back, huh? Because that's what the rules said. I don't know. You don't know? Why don't I just go find Lyle, and ask him? Hah? Hah? Have a little conversation with your scam buddy? Yeah. It is just a game. Will you relax? The words of a guilty man, Barb. - I want my 20 bones. - Shut up, Alan. - I want my 20 bones. - Shut up, Alan. Aw, come on... And now our host, Brent Moore. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, this is Brent Moore. We have got a great show for you this evening. Ms. Carol Collins is here, and Lidel Jones, the king of country himself, so stay right where you are... Ow-ww! Ugh! Alan...! Alan? Come on, this is not funny! Alan? Oh, shit, that's great. Son of a bitch. Alan, come out. Alan! Oh, man! Yah-hh! Hey, Renee. What are you doing? - Hey. Where's Lewis? - He's not here? No. Do you know where he is? - I don't know. - You live with him, don't you? I stayed at Barb's last night. I lent him my overhead sheets for professor Hartwig's class, and he swore to me that he would have them back today. If you see him, tell him he is in deep shit with me. Lewis, you are in big trouble. You are such... Lewis? Somebody shut the power off. So he comes down these stairs, and... I don't know, tripped over the coffee table, and hit his head? No... No, this place was a mess. Somebody would have called us if he was in the hospital, wouldn't they? Have you checked your machine? Hi, honey, it's mom. Will you please come over early on Sunday? Your father thinks he's going to set up Nathan's swing set all by himself. See you then. Bye, hon. Hi, bro', it's Dillon. Rhonda says not to buy Nathan any army toys for his birthday. Why don't you just pick him up some lipstick, or a dress? I'll see you Sunday. All right. Don't panic. Just relax. Drink your beer. Somebody will call. What? What is it? It's my clue for the prophet's game. Let me see. "I am the creator. I call the warriors together. I know the secrets in the water. Are you afraid to die? Or will you come again with the king?" I don't know. How does this guy know where I live? I don't know. Hello? Detective Swan? Who's calling? Chief of police, Robert bowman. I'm returning your call. I didn't call you. Apparently somebody thinks you should have. I don't know what you have on your schedule for tomorrow... But I'd like you come to the station, if you don't mind. What did you do with the postcard? I threw it away. It didn't mean anything to me. Until I got the phone call. Did he ask you to come? Is that why you're here? We didn't ask you here to pry into your personal affairs, detective... But I assume that's why he left your number behind. Obviously, he's trying to get us to make a connection with the "little Jack" murders. Yeah, he's trying... But we got that guy. No, you got a guy. It's not like he made it to trial. You said you were the only person there that day, yet you claim that you don't remember anything. Is that right? Yeah. Yeah. You don't recall anything? No, not really. I mean, just bits and pieces. Not much. I took a pretty good blow to the head. You're lucky to still be here. Yeah. I'm willing to go with the fact that we're probably dealing with a copy cat here, but I'm curious, though... How did this Johnny-come-lately find out about the game? It was a front page story. They had it all in print. Except the clues. They were never really published. Listen... I think he left that message for me to call you. Now, that tells me he wants you here, and he knows where you are. I'm certain he'll try to contact you... So, I'd like to run a tap on your phone. I'd also like to bring you into the station. Strictly a desk job for now. What do you think? I think I'm retired. Well, sleep on it... And I'll call you tomorrow. Thank you. Thank you. Bob, you can't be serious. Jesus Christ, you know what this guy did in Seattle. So does he. He doesn't have amnesia, that's a line of shit. This guy is dangerous, I don't want him here. That's exactly why I do, and I want you to keep an eye on him. Get him a baby-sitter. Who the hell am I supposed to get? Find someone. What about that gal they just shifted over from vice? Frances... Yeah, I could do that. I want you to make sure she keeps him busy. I don't want a vigilante on my street. Hello? How did it go at the station? Did they ask for your help, or do they know about your mistake? - I didn't make a mistake. - You made a ghost... And I'm more powerful than I've ever been. I see everything now. You will believe. You're so much smarter than they are. Use them to find me. I want you to. I'm looking forward to seeing you again. Why don't you come and see me? That's not how the game is played. You will have to wait your turn. The first game started about 10 years ago, on a bulletin board at a junior college in Cincinnati, Ohio. From there it moved to Chicago, Las Vegas, and then Seattle. In the beginning the police didn't realize that their local celebrity murders were connected to their missing persons list. Not even after they found the first contestant gravesite. Why? Well, there were no similarities between them. All the celebrities had a consistent M.O... Severe beatings, and excessive stab wounds. All the victims were killed on the spot, and no attempts were made to conceal the crime scene. Each of the victims was dismembered, and those particular body parts... Well, they left the crime scene with the killer. Like Luna Wells. Yeah, but the contestants were different. He kidnapped them. He kept them alive for a while. Apparently he wanted to form some kind of a bond with them. But he did eventually kill them, and this is where they ended up. Right here. When he started to surface, the police realized that both sets of murders were connected. But by that time Cincinnati had dubbed their celebrity killer "little Jack." "Little Jack the ripper." The FBI issued a generic profile... - White male, between 25 and 35. - Excuse me, captain? Yeah? That's not the guy we're looking for, right? This is a copycat, isn't it? What's his profile? I wouldn't be surprised if it was the same. Captain, what about the game? Will it be the same? Do we even know if there is one? If he's really mimicking "little Jack," yeah... Probably it will be the same. This is how it will go. There will be five contestants. Each contestant will have a symbol. They'll have a number or a color. More than likely it'll start on a college campus, somewhere out in the open, because he needs to see who his contestants are. He also needs to be able to follow them. The more he knows about them, the more he can control them later. Needless to say, we need to find them. We need to do it quickly, quietly... and no press. You think he's already started eliminating the contestants? I think it's possible... more probable every day that he's out there. This gentleman in the back is retired Seattle detective, Vincent Swan. He worked the real McCoy. Chief Bowen has asked him to stay on, so he'll be in here with Frances to answer any questions you might have about this investigation, okay? That's it, folks. Hi. I'm Vincent Swan. - Frances Aldobrandi. - Nice to meet you, Frances. Please, don't call me "Frances," please. It's "Aldobrandi." Okay. Aldobrandi? Do you think you could help me over here for a second? In a minute. Can't smoke in here. This is L.A. Hey, mother superior... Print me out a missing persons report, would you? Have you got a lead? Nah. Captain thinks we might luck out interviewing the families. You never know, one of them might have been playing the game. Right. How's it going there, chief? You know how to run that thing? Al, show him how to do it. - I'm busy right now! - Come on, give him a break. All right, I'm out of here. Got my cell phone if you need me. So, what do you want to know how to do? Well, I was trying to pull up Luna Wells' forensic report. You don't have access to that. How about the missing persons report, then? You don't have access to that, either. What do I have access to? Solitaire. Oh, what's that? Card game. I don't think I was put here for this. I think I should be doing something important. Frances, this is important. Trust me on this, please. But what can he do? He can't have access to anything. I told you I was going to take care of you, and you are going to take on more of an active role. But right now, I need you in there with him. I need to know what he's thinking, I need to know what his state of mind is. Please. "Oh, how art thou fallen from heaven, o Lucifer." He was clever, don't you think... - for a monster? - What? "Little Jack." I'm just reading some of his clues. They thought the answers were all dead celebrities, right? That's how he tripped them up. When he switched to live ones, they were still looking in the history books. Yeah. You think they'd have caught on eventually. Oh, they did. But he had them so scared, they'd do anything he wanted them to. The only reason they found three bodies instead of five in the Seattle grave... Is because some kids found it, called it in. Just luck. I noticed a "Swan" on the list. No relation, is it? She was my daughter. Oh... I'm sorry... I... didn't know. They didn't tell me. It's all right. I'm gonna go outside for awhile... And chomp on a cigar. Frances, you busy? I need to see you for a second. Sure. Shall I bring my notes? No. I need you to run to Manny's and grab some sandwiches, we're starving in there. - You don't mind, do you? - No. It's "babysit." "Baby-sit." Hyphen. Which file? Missing persons report? "F-8." Your daughter's name was on... Our missing persons report. Was there any trouble? There wasn't any foul play in her disappearance, detective. She was trying to get away from her ex-husband. He filed a report, but I've spoken to her on the phone since then. She's fine. Thank you. Hello? Congratulations, blue player. You have reached phase two of the game. What? Who is this? Do you have your answer? Lewis...? Lewis, is this you? What is your answer, blue player? Who is this? Listen, kid, I don't know how you got my number, but don't call me at home, okay? - give me your answer, blue player. - I don't have one. I'm sorry, I've got too much going on right now. I really don't have time for this. Tell your dad, or whatever... That "blue" is out of the game, okay? Thanks. He didn't give me an answer. You know what that means. No! No, please don't! No! - You think they enjoyed it? - Oh, they loved it, Simon. Didn't you hear the response? I'm delighted. I'm delighted, too, because, you know I have a book signing on Friday, and the Brent Moore show on Tuesday, and I am a bit worried. Do you think the American public realizing that I'm nothing more than a dull-witted Englishman with a very large garden will affect my book sales? Wear black, darling. They will never know the difference. Here's my husband now. Good night, Simon. Thank you so much for speaking tonight. It was a wonderful time. My pleasure. Good night, Kathryn. Good night. Bloody hell! Oh, this is rather embarrassing. You wouldn't happen to know anything about changing a tire, would you? There must be some trick to it. Oh, no. Yeah, it's Swan here. Drive to the cultural center in thousand oaks. You'll find a car with a flat tire. It belongs to the author, Simon Davenport. If you look closely, you will find Simon, although I doubt you will recognize him. Why is that? Are you stalling me, detective? How long does it take to trace a call these days? What are you doing here? Listen, Swan, I want to talk to you about what happened today. I don't want you to think... do you know your way to thousand oaks? Yeah. Okay. We're going, and you're driving. Jesus fucking Christ. It's like a fucking Wes craven movie over there. Yeah, tell me about it. He took his head. Can you believe that? I know it. Where's Swan? Over there, looking at Davenport. Get him out of there. Why did you bring him here? I didn't. He brought me. What are we going to tell the press? - We're not. - What? Look, take his car and park it someplace where it can sit for a few days. Let somebody on patrol find it. Take his watch, his wallet, his rings, anything else that can help identify him. He's going in as a John Doe. I wouldn't do that. Come here. I'm only going to say this once. You mind your own fucking business, and don't you ever second-guess me in front of my team again, you got it? I was just going to say... no, I'm saying that if the press gets hold of this, they are going to have a field day with it. Every goddamn psychopath within 50 miles is going to be taking potshots at celebrities, and this town will be shut down. You understand? Look, you got people here. What's going to keep that paramedic from telling his wife, and who's his wife gonna tell? I wouldn't do this, Walter. When internal affairs hears about this kind of thing, you know what... are you threatening me? This guy is famous. He's gonna be missed. I'll handle it. Keep your mouth shut. Somebody get this blood cleaned up. Nothing happened here. You ready to go? Frances, get him out of here. Yes, sir! Quit calling me "Frances." He can't do this. This is illegal. He knows it. Are you backing him in this? He's just trying to buy a little time. He's just... You know... Even good people make terrible mistakes sometimes. Is that what he says to you? That I made a mistake? No, I was just... I know what your job is. You think you got to play the game to get ahead? Let's just go. No... I'll catch a cab. Look... I don't know what you think is going on, but I'm not your confidante, okay? You have something to get off your chest? Go tell a priest. I have no intention of risking my job for you. Stop, stop. Hello? Blue player... You have forfeited your answer for this round of the game. It will be marked against you. Who is this? From now on, you will play by the rules. You have to finish the game. No! I'm out. Okay? Alan, play the game. Lewis? Just play the fucking game. Lewis, where are you? I'm calling the police. No! Don't call the police, Alan. Please... he'll kill me. - Just play the game. - Where are you? I'm calling the police right now. He's with me. We are watching you, Alan. I see you in the living room, I see you in the bagel shop on your way to work. I stood next to you Sunday mornings at the gym. I know everything about you, Alan. Everywhere you go, everyone you talk to. I will know if you tell, and I will kill Lewis if you do. - do you understand? - Yes. There's nothing. It's a bad address. It's got to be a screen for something else. Honey, you have to go to the police. Barb, I can't. He's gonna kill him if he finds out I've said anything. I'm gonna have to keep playing until I figure out what to do. What is there to figure out? Barb... will you just let me think, please? Game... oh... Alan? Can I tell you a secret? Simon Davenport won't be speaking on Friday. He's dead. They brought him in last night. Why is that a secret? Because... He was logged in as a "John Doe." - Why? - I don't know. He was decapitated, but the police knew it has him. Jody told me. They didn't even put him in the freezer. They put him in a hot box with some sand and dirt, so that he'd decompose in his clothes. What for? I don't know. I couldn't ask any questions. If they found out that Jody told me anything, they'd let us both go. But there's something going on down there. Holy shit. Holy shit. Okay, okay... Listen... "I am the creator. I call the warriors together. I know the secrets in the water. Are you afraid to die? Or will you come again with the king?" Now... Look at these books that he wrote. Match them up. "I call the warriors together." "Gathering of the tribes." "I know the secrets in the water." "Dredge the lake." "Are you afraid to die?" "Fear of death." "Or will you come again with the king?" "The king shall rise." Simon Davenport is the answer. He was not dead when I got this. And listen... This is the clue that I got before it. "A lady in scarves comes not from the east... Too fair of face on their sands. She is the moon by which the moth navigates. Yet, cast your eyes down. She ends in deep waters." I don't know. Barb... "A lady in scarves comes not from the east"? Who's got a CD out right now? She wears veils in her posters. Luna Wells. This is the guy that killed her, Barb. That's why it's called "the prophet's game." He's predicting his next murder. Get it? He's telling us. He's telling the players. He's giving us a chance to save them. - We're calling the police. - No, no, no, no. No. That's why he took Lewis. So I'll be quiet, and I'll keep playing. - What is the point? - It's winning. Maybe if I can win, I will get him back. What if you don't win? What then? Is he going to come after you, too? He knows where you live, Alan. You have to tell the police. I will, I will, okay? Just... not yet. Let me play it out for a while. I've only missed two, I'm in better shape than most of the other players. How do you know? Do you know who any of the other players are? They're all here on campus, right? What if one of them knows who the prophet is? So just relax. Everything's going to be okay. All right? Okay. I'll see you. He resides in Seattle. Your story begins there. Okay, Vincent Swan. Like the bird, right? That is correct. I'm sorry, I didn't get your name. Hello? Mrs. Garcia? Before Jeff disappeared, did he mention a game to you that he was playing? What kind of game? A trivia game, something that he would have picked up somewhere. You mentioned that he was a student at Sierra vista university? Yes... I don't remember. Once, he showed me a little poem on an orange piece of paper, but it didn't rhyme or anything. I thought it was for one of his poetry classes. Do you still have that? No. But you think that he got it at the school? Yeah, I think so. Thank you, you're very helpful, Mrs. Garcia. Thank you. So, Jeff Garcia's wife... Said that he was playing something on campus... When he disappeared. This could be it. What were you doing talking to Garcia's wife? Where did you get the missing persons list? - Off the computer. - Not yours. Who gave you their password? I figured it out. What's the matter? This could be a contestant. You wouldn't have found this if it was. "Little Jack" would have pulled it down before anyone had a chance to see it. This isn't "little Jack." Bullshit. You know it is. You wouldn't be here if it wasn't. You came looking for the right guy this time. I got the right guy. You don't have a fucking clue who you got. And you had no business being up there in the first place. It wasn't your case. They pulled you off it, because they knew they couldn't trust you with the suspect. - That's not true. - Why did he end up dead? Don't sit there and tell me that you don't remember, because I know that you do. Are you calling me a liar? You were a cop, Swan. Your job was to uphold the law, not take it into your own hands. You fucked that up. You raced up to that gravesite before anyone else had a chance to get there. When you found your daughter was in it, you lost it, you went out and grabbed the first person you could find, and you beat him to death. That's bullshit. That son of a bitch murdered my daughter... And they knew she was dead before I ever found her. That's why they took me off the case... And that is the only reason. Any department would have done the same. Don't sit there like you've got something over my head. Damn it, I almost ate it that day. What do you want from me, a medal? I thought they gave you one of those before they booted your ass out. I retired. Why is that? Did your friends threaten to stop lying for you? Did they set that fire to cover your ass, or did you do it when you found out you killed the wrong man? Which one was it? I didn't set the fire. How would you know? You don't remember. Aldobrandi, get in here. - She didn't do anything. - I'll make sure she doesn't. Now, your place in my department is behind a desk, period. You are not to be involved with anything outside of that room, do you understand me? Is anyone gonna meet that kid? That is not your business. If I find you anywhere near that Marina, I will personally shove your ass on a plane back home. You got it? That's it. Get out. Yes, sir? Close the door, and sit down. Frances... I think it's time we get you more involved. Lone white male, 5'8", blue jacket, baseball cap. Looks like he's waiting on someone. All right, Frances, you're in. You wouldn't happen to know where "the prophet's game" is moored, would you? Simon Davenport isn't missing, he's dead. He's been dead for a week, and the police have known it the whole time. That's not a contestant. Get the son of a bitch. - which player are you? - I'm blue. I'm blue. Police! Stop! Goddamn it, Swan! Officer down! Damn it! Sorry. Damn! Hello, blue player. Do you have your answer? Tell me your answer, blue player. You have an answer, don't you? I don't have it with me. - Do you forfeit? - No. No. Ryan... Ryan Davidson. Blue player, you are wrong. You motherfucker. - What happened? - Nothing, I'm fine. - It was just stupid... - What is it? No, no, no. It's dumb. What the hell are you doing here? What the hell are you doing? You just lost that contestant. That wasn't a contestant, goddamn it. Since when does the LAPD start running around with their guns out? Chasing innocent bystanders? What are you gonna do, to shoot him for loitering? We don't kill innocent people. That's your job. It was the guy. He knew about Davenport. I could give any paramedic 50 dollars and find out about Davenport. Get your ass out of here. I want you out. How long do you think you will keep that a secret? You say one word... one more fucking word, and you're out. Fuck you! You son of a bitch, you're off this case. Don't want to see you anywhere near my people! Are you okay, All? You think maybe you should go see a doctor? No, but maybe you should if the captain finds you here. Nah, he wasn't serious. Don't bet on it. Why? Did he say something to you? No. God... what is it with you two? You think you're breaking new ground here, going for each other's throat all the time? I can rent that stuff off any shelf at the video store. Just get over yourselves, and quit trying to drag me into it. Didn't bust my butt for 12 years to make homicide so I could end up a spy. - I'm a lousy spy. - Oh, I know. You get great sandwiches, though. Thanks. That's why I was there today. He thinks I'm a double agent. He just wants to get my loyalty back. And even if I can convince him he never lost it, he's never going to trust me again. I can talk to him. Oh, yeah! You defending me. He'll know we're in cahoots, then. Hey, are we? Come on. I thought I told you to get out. What part of that don't you understand? I want to talk to you. Get out. Just give me a minute. You got two fucking seconds before I find myself a good reason to have you arrested. You go ahead and arrest me. Cuff him. Back off, Princess. You... get your tap off my fucking phone! Excuse me. Mr. Jones, did you...? Si no me hubieras hecho El daño que... Oh, damn it. Damn it. What the fuck do you want, you miserable piece of shit? I was careless. I've ruined the surprise. Well, I got a surprise for you. I'm out of here. You can play your little game all by your fucking self. You can't leave now. We've almost reached the end, and you're such an important part of the game. Why should I stay? You haven't showed me anything new. You're just a cheap, knock-off, murder-of-the-month, copycat killer. Oh, you still don't believe. What can I say? Say goodbye, you... Twisted fuck! She wore a silver class ring with a blue stone. It wasn't hers. It belonged to a friend who killed herself in '86. She never took it off. She asked me to Bury her with it. She thought it would be easier for you to identify her. God...! Oh, my god! Swan...? Swan? Don't come in here, al. Are you all right? Swan, I want to talk to you a minute. Why? Did Walter send you? - Wearing a wire? - No. Want to frisk me? Swan, I'm not against you. I just want to know what's really going on. I want you to tell me. What you remember about that day? Where are my fucking cigars? You know what I remember? Rage. All-out fucking rage. I see Nancy in the grave... And then I see him, I think it's him. I don't know, it's just a picture in my head. I don't know who he is. Then afterwards there's nothing left of him, it's just a pile of ashes. Did you set the fire? I don't know. Maybe I did. Maybe... Maybe I knew I had made a mistake. Maybe that's why it's never set right with me. That was my "d" day. I should have walked away from there... Knowing what I'm made of, knowing what kind of man I am. I mean, I walked in there thinking that I knew. But... I sure as hell don't know now. You really don't know what happened that day? I fucked up, Al. I fucked up. It wasn't him. He was a perfect substitute, though. Nothing came up on him, nobody came to claim him, he didn't work for anyone, his landlord didn't know who he was... He just said he was "weird." That was enough for them. Case closed, here's your medal. But I didn't deserve it... Because it wasn't him. Fuck! Where the fuck are my cigars?! Here. Oh, great. Thanks. So... I should have known. Actually, I knew when I got the postcard. Yeah, I knew. I should have died with that poor bastard. Swan... I can't say I know how you feel, I do know that everything happens for a reason. You just got to have faith that god is going somewhere with all this. Well, let me tell you... how much faith I have in god right now. You don't have to. I've got enough to carry both of us for a while. Don't you help me... god forbid. God forbid. It's so hot. Here. How did you do that? That's broke. You're going to make the same mistake you made before... If you continue this on your own. But... You're going to do it anyway... So I might as well help you. Listen, you can't help me. Don't argue with me, goddamn it! You need help. It doesn't guarantee you're going to be the one to catch the bastard, but I don't see anyone else out there rushing to your side, so I suggest you just shut up, and take whatever you can get. Does this mean... That we're in cahoots, Al? I'll call you tomorrow, after I get out of confession. Thank you. Okay. Here you go. Internal affairs knows something's up with Davenport. So does the press. Jones' housekeeper is set to talk about what she knows, which isn't very much. She can't even describe the guy. So what did he take? He scalped him. That's all I know. Okay, well... Keep your ears open, Al... And... Watch your back. What are you going to do? I'm going to go back and get that contestant. Detective Swan. Have you heard of "the prophet's game"? - No, sir, I haven't. - I'm sorry. Have you heard of a game called "the prophet's game"? Have you heard of a game called "the prophet's game"? I'm detective Swan. Have you heard of a game called "the prophet's game"? - No. - "Prophet's game"? - Hi. - Hi. - Are you a detective? - Yes, detective Vincent Swan. My name is Renee. Listen, I have a friend. He's also a T.A. Here, and he was... I've seen this game that you're asking about. Remember me? I'm the guy that chased you yesterday. Don't you know you're supposed to stop when a police officer tells you to? I can't tell you anything. He's got my friend. He'll kill him. Have a seat. So how did you find the game? On the Internet. I got an invitation to play. I thought it was one of my co-workers, because we always posted our answers here on campus. I tried to track down the email address after I found out about Simon Davenport, but it wasn't valid. He's either disguising it, or he cancelled it. How did you know about Davenport? My fiancee is an intern at county. It's a long story. But it doesn't matter. I'm caught, right? I knew I'd have to come forward eventually, but I wanted to wait until I was down to my last clue. He's my best friend. I just couldn't give him up. I don't know anyone else's plan. I mean, I think there are five of us. I'm still in, I think green is. Orange was out before Lewis. Lewis was yellow. Red's probably out now, he only had one left. They... Are they gone, too? Yeah. - Are they still alive? - Yeah, I think so. Can you guarantee me the prophet won't find out, if I tell the police what I know? No. I can't guarantee you that the police won't leak something. To the press, but I can guarantee you that I won't. And if you want me to stick it out with you, then you're going to have to cooperate with me, which means that you can't do anything, and you can't go anywhere unless I say so. If you have family here, stop seeing them. Your girlfriend, too. I don't want him catching you with anyone. Now... How many clues... Have you missed? Three. I have three left. Three? Good. Then we still have some time. You see, each clue refers to a book that Simon Davenport wrote. That's how I finally figured it out, but he was already dead by then. You can't always be 100%. The main thing is that... You've stayed in the game this long, you're good at it, you're going to buy us a little extra time. Captain Mott, is it true that you have Simon Davenport's body? No comment. We know that these murders run parallel to a series - in five other cities. - No comment. Is it true that you contacted the Seattle detective who killed the suspect in those cases? No comment. Isn't it possible then, that the suspect was a victim, and not the true killer? Yes. That's not what Vincent Swan says. Oh, boy. I don't know a Vincent Swan. Who is Vincent Swan? That's the question many want answered. At the LAPD, Leah Sanders, back to you. - Al? - Yeah. Just a minute. Detective Aldobrandi, I want you to meet the blue player. Hi, Alan Joyce. I remember you. I remember you. Wait till you see him tackle these clues out. He kid really knows what he's doing. As a matter of fact, we are gonna beat the killer at the game, huh? I wouldn't put all your faith on me, all right? Unfortunately, you're all we have right now. Don't you worry, you're going to do fine. Oh, this will help. "If there are 7, I do 5. If I do 5, you see 10. Point me in, and point me out... Make the 6 move. I am no more." It's got to be something with numbers in it. Yeah. Have some kid... Do a drop and run to the station. Maybe some of the guys can get it. Hey, guys? Come here. I got us some help. This is Seibert. Seibert Fullstrom. Three-time national crossword champion. Have I got a puzzle for you. - Al, you wanna...? - This is... Wait, wait. Shhh. ♪ Deet-da-dway oh, pharanome. Pharanome! I tried to think of that all day. Pharanome. You guys have a puzzle? Yeah. You know, there's never been one I can't solve. See, the thing is this... There's a standing offer in Europe, right? 25,000 dollars for anyone... anyone... who can compose 16 bars of original music... And no one's ever done it. No one's ever done it. You see, there are no original notes, and there are no original thoughts. If you guys want to solve the problem... You've got to start thinking like the thinker. Think like the thinker. It's the best I can do. See what you can find out. What do you got? Well... Relax. You're doing fine. I can do it, I'm just... I'll get it. Yeah, I know you will. Don't answer it. I'm not ready. - We've got to. - Vince... Just give him what you got. Wait. Wait a minute. Okay, go ahead. Just be calm, come on. All right. Hello? Hello, blue player. Do you have your answer? Yes, but I want to speak to Lewis first. I won't ask you again. Ethan Forrester. Blue player, you are wrong. Oh, shit! You did the best you could, okay? No, I didn't. Wait a second. I can't do this. Who am I kidding? I can't solve these clues. Of course you can. You did it before. No, I didn't. I cheated. What? I stole green player's answers. He always got them right. I would just wait till he put his up, and then I would copy them down. Why would you do that? Because I didn't have any time. It was just a running joke. I only played to tease Lewis, and I didn't want to spoil it. I wouldn't be here now if I hadn't cheated, I'd be where he is. Why in the hell didn't you tell me that before? The only reason you didn't make me come forward, is because you thought I could buy you time, right? I know I'm doing a shitty job, but I'm keeping my best friend alive. - I'm trying. - Okay. People, you're being ridiculous. I don't see you coming up with anything, "champ." Seven wonders of the world... 26 letters in the alphabet... You stop, right? 18 holes on a golf course... Nine digits in the social security... - This incessant... babbling! - 4 quarts in a gallon... - 2 pieces of pie. - 5 digits in a zip code. 24 hours in a day... 24 hours in a day. I can have, like, a moment to think? Whoa... Okay. Hello? He is with you, Alan. Who? If you think it will affect the outcome of the game, you are both wrong. I am the one who determines who lives and dies. You have forfeited your next round of the game. No. No. Wait, wait, wait. Hello? I just... shit. Shit! Hey... - Calm down. - No, you calm down! It's not anyone you care about that he's got, it's my friend. If he dies, it's your fault. You said he wouldn't find out. I said I wouldn't tell the press. Well, is Lewis still alive? He isn't, is he? He's already killed him. Tell me. Well, I don't know. Probably. Then why the fuck am I playing? This guy has got more cards up his sleeve than you know about, and if he thinks that you're on to what he did to your friend... Things are only gonna get worse for you. They can't get any worse. Oh, yes, they can. Where are you going? Going out. No, you're not. Why not? He's not coming after me tonight. You know it. Why don't you go on back to your motel? You don't want to miss his call. I've got to tell you, we're not getting the full story from the LAPD. Are you saying that the LAPD is involved in a coverup here? Brent, I think the cops have Simon Davenport's body, and the reason they are hiding it is because they don't want us to know that there is a serial killer in our midst, and it's not just any serial killer, it's "little Jack." Does Vincent Swan agree with this? Vincent Swan wouldn't be here unless he knew he made a mistake, and he may well have known all along, which is why he was probably the one that started that fire. Come on. He was covering his proverbial ass. I couldn't have said it any better myself. We'll be back. "Point me in, point me out... Make the 6 move." Hello? Al, it's Swan. - It's Brent Moore. - What? Five shows out of a 7-day week... - Right? - Right. Two guests on every show, that makes 10. Uh-huh... "Make the 6 move"... channel 6... "I am no more." Not "more"... "Moore." - M-o-o-r-e. - Oh, wow. - Brent Moore. - Great. Great, Swan. - Yeah? - Yeah. - I'm on it. - Yeah. Good night, everybody, good show. - Police. - What's this all about? We're placing you in protective custody. What for? We'll explain downtown. Get in the car. I should never have let him go. See... If he thinks that... Alan tipped off the police about Moore, he's going to retaliate against him. If we can't find him now, chances are he can't either. Hey, Swan... How many lives can you save in a night? - Does Walter know? - Yeah. He thinks I gave you the clue. He doesn't know whether to give me a medal or suspend me. Well, he'll do it. - back off for a while. - No, he won't do it. He needs all the feathers in his cap he can get. Internal affairs is closing in on him. Even chief bowman won't return his calls. I'm telling you... Don't push your luck. Too late. I'm already on the path. I have to go where it leads. It's going to lead to you losing your job. Maybe... But sometimes you just have to operate on faith. Faith? Al, you're in the wrong profession. But I've got a good title for you. Ready? "Saint Frances." - Um-hmm. - Sorry... I'm one miracle shy. Yeah, well, it ain't over yet. Alan. I heard. Congratulations. Now, I want you out of my house. Alan, we had to save Moore. I mean it. I just want you out. Give me a break, okay? That's really not a very good idea. I don't care. This is my house, and I want you out. Just get out. We've got to go. Alan, I'm going to be outside. I'm not leaving you by yourself. You've got the number, right? Alan... you have the number, right? What? Cheaters must pay the price, Alan. Just fuck you, all right? I know you've killed him. You've got nothing to keep me quiet anymore. I can tell everyone. Can you? What will happen to your parents at 325 Gardner street? Or your brother and his wife at 1812 woodman drive? Who will they blame if there's no more baby to throw a birthday party for? And it was such a good one. Barbara looked lovely... Although I prefer her in blue. Light, like the shade of her bedspread... Looks like you're a celebrity now, huh? Oh, yeah. Big star. He's been in Barb's house. He knows where my family lives. That's how he keeps us quiet, isn't it? Yeah. I want you to make a deal with me. What's that? If I miss his last clue, you walk away. - I'll fend for myself. - Alan... It's bad enough that I have to live with what happened to Lewis... But if he touches my family, or he touches Barb... I don't know what I'm going to do. There are things we can do to protect them. You can't guarantee anything, and you know it. And I can't afford to take the risk. So either you agree... Or I'm gonna shut you out. You're not gonna see my last clue. Alan, you can't do this. That's the fuckin' deal. Take it or leave it. - Okay. - All right? Okay. It was in my mail slot this morning. Vengeful bird did hunt blindly in the storm. A handful of ashes for what lay in dirt. Two are at rest, two are at odds. A feather in my hand when it's done. And I don't know who it is. I just might. It's Jean Laroque. - The oceanographer? - Yep. He doesn't live here, does he? He's had his ship in the Marina for the past two months. He's filming a new documentary here. You sure it's him? The vengeful bird is albatross ii. The handful of ashes is albatross I. The Japanese torched it when he was over there with Greenpeace protesting commercial whaling. Two of his crew died. Two at rest. You knew that? So, here's what we're going to do. I'm going to have somebody drop the clue off at the station. You're gonna answer it, Al. Take your time, think it out. Make it look good, okay? Alan, you're gonna have to answer wrong. But I've only got one left. If I miss this, I'm out of the game. Hello? Hello, blue player. Do you have your answer? Randy Linch. Blue player, you have missed six questions. You are out of the game. All right, go to the hotel. I'll call you later. Aren't you coming? No, I've got something I've got to do. I'll catch up with you later, all right? No, it's too easy. - Hello? - Congratulations. It was an easy clue. You should have spared yourself the effort, just written my name down. You should be flattered. I've given you your 15 minutes of fame. I'm sorry it has to end so abruptly. Oh, I'm ready for it to end. I'm sure you are ready, but it isn't that simple. I have no intention of coming to you. You will come to me. And to make sure you come alone, I've taken out a little insurance. Swan? Jesus Christ. Aldobrandi. It isn't Jean Laroque. I know. Don't come. Where are you? I don't know. Such a brave girl. She reminds me of Nancy. Where are you? Get your map out, you're going to need it. What are you... oh, my... god! Holy Mary, mother of god, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death... Welcome, detective. Welcome, detective. I said, "welcome." Adele! Adele! Joey! Joey! You were there. I didn't kill the wrong man. I couldn't remember. You were a team. That's good. You're figuring it out. Give me the gun. Go ahead, shoot me. When I fall, this candle falls with me. Do you smell the gasoline? Okay. All right. All right. Get down on your knees. It's time to start begging. All right, you've got me. I do have you, don't I? And this time, you're not walking away. That's fine, but she has nothing to do with this. She's not part of this game. You can let her go. Oh, but she is. You get to watch what I do to her. Just like I had to watch what you did to my brother. But, I had to kill him, he was going to kill me. But you made a big mistake. I was the one who killed Nancy, not Joey. And I should have been there to protect him from you. I should have cut you up into little pieces. I should have stuck your head on that fence post the way I did that stupid dog of his. Joey never laid a hand on your daughter. Why did you have to go and kill him? Why didn't you just let it go like all the other families? But you had to go looking for revenge. I was a detective. Revenge was never my intention. Yes, it was, big man. You had to go kill the monster. Well, you ought to know by now, that when you enter the monster's world, the monster's world enters you. You're no better than I am, detective. I guess we're both monsters. But, she isn't. I killed your brother. You killed my daughter. You can do whatever you want to me. But she's innocent. For god's sake, let her go. You're in no position to bargain. You have nothing left to offer. How can I help her? You already did. You came here. I wanted you to come here. I wanted you to see what you inspired. I wanted you to see what you're going to be a part of. I couldn't decide... Exactly what part of you that I wanted for this. I knew it had to be something very special, you see? It was really hard, because it had to be perfect. You... you ripped my heart out when you killed Joey. You killed my daughter. And I'm going to rip your heart out. And it's perfect. It's perfect. Because, you see... Because you're what makes the game tick. You're the heart of the game. Are we having fun? We're out of here! Are you okay, Al? I'm fine. I'm fine. Just go! What, it wasn't loaded? No, I just wanted to throw her off. And lucky for you, it worked. 'Cause it wasn't me that she shot at. Just go. Just go. I'll call for backup. I left my phone in the car. It's down the hill. Holy Mary! Sweet Jesus! Oh, god! You son of a bitch. You ripped my heart out when you killed Joey. Swan! Swan. Swan, come on, now. Swan, you gotta help me. Come on, now. Adele! Drop the knife. Lay it on the ground. The gun's empty. I've got one in the chamber. Now... Drop the knife. You son of a bitch! You spoil everything. Put the knife down. Go ahead and shoot me. Or have you developed a conscience all of a sudden? Or maybe you'd like to beat me to death, like I did your precious daughter? Put the knife down! Take it. Go on... Take it. - Stop! - Take it! Go ahead, kill me. Shoot me. You know you want to. It'll make you feel better. You can get away with it. It'll be self-defense. Go on... Go on, kill me. Kill me. It'll make you feel so much better. Go on, kill me. Kill me. Kill me. Come on... Shoot me... Please! Please! Officer down. Stay with me now. Stay with me. Come on. This really hurts. Nobody said coming back from the dead was going to be easy. Looks like your third miracle, Saint Frances. Stop calling me Frances. All right, get her out of here. Hang on there, Al, okay? Come on, guys, you got to get here there. Let's go. Are you okay? Yeah, it's just... Really cold out here. Swan? Hey... Swan. Swan? I'm gonna get you... I'm gonna get you. Lunch is ready. Thanks, honey. Nobody said recovery had to be painful. Aldobrandi. No, I guess not. Joey... They think they won... They think they have me... They think they're smarter than us. But they don't know... We're not here... We're just... Not... here.
