It's a good deal. Call me any time. She didn't say you'd be here. Everywhere the same. Sorry? I said all cities look the same. Everywhere the same. Same apartments, same people, same stupid shit. You're here for the apartment? Yeah. You interested? I don't know. Bad job. Here. Here! My crutches. I can't do nothing no more. Here. Stop. Please. You want the apartment? It's expensive. I don't know... The view... Bye. Hey. Yeah. All right. Sure. No, sure. As soon as possible. Thanks. Found a place to stay? Not yet. Are you OK? Am I OK? No, I'm not OK. Give me a minute. I'm almost done. We need to talk. Micha, you need to rest. I do my exercises... It's just badly broken. Sit down and let me take a look at your leg. Listen... Give yourself a chance. Did you give away my act? It's not that simple. I'm a good acrobat. Don't be dramatic. Take a break and we'll see. I didn't do anything. They said it was my fault. It's no one's fault. I know how it works. Take care of yourself and we'll see. We'll see, we'll see... I'm finished. I'll see what I can do. There's always work here. Let's have a drink! No, thanks. Need a lift?

Is construction finished on the 20th? They said there are problems. Problems? Don't know. Hello! What's going on? You're not from here. 1 move around for my job. Did you buy the apartment? As you see, that's my stuff. Your apartment's crappy. It'll be easy to resell. I'll even make money. Not so sure. Lost your crutches? On the roof. They came early. Bastards... Here. You could have killed yourself. So many times I've fallen So many times I've gotten up And I keep going It's not good to talk about death. I know my strength. That's for sure. I don't actually speak Russian. How do you know I speak Russian? From movies. No, thanks. Here. Come over here. You broke your leg. Someone wanted my job. Sorry about your accident. Why are you sorry? It wasn't an accident. What did you do? Not your business. Problems to deal with. Mom. Mom. Next. Your pace is too early on your last movement. That's why you can't catch the bar. Don't give up, guys. My act's a lot of work. Come here, please. You lied to me. Please calm down. It's not at all what you think. You think I am stupid. Who gave you my act? It's not your act. I did it first. OK, we start again. You win. Hey, Micha. Where's my money? You know what insurance companies are like. I have nothing. It'll get sorted out. I'm telling you I have nothing. I want my money. I'll let you know. Hello, can I help you? Twentieth floor. The man downstairs has a problem. He's doing his job. That's not work. Like you. I've always worked, OK? All right. You know nothing about it. You forgot this. Does it hurt? Can I have one? You don't smoke. I used to. Good Turkish tobacco. What's your name? No names. It's good. Understand? No names. OK. Careful.

I told you the first day. Bad deal. You're a clown. -So? Careful, you could break your neck. Never say that again. Relax. I'm hungry. It'll have to wait. I have things to do. Are you OK? -Yeah. Thanks. -Be careful. Sit down. -No, I'm fine. You don't look... I'm fine. Your breathing. That's how it is. Nothing can be done. We could get some fresh air. No more snow removal. How are you? -Me? Fine. You look different. You didn't eat. -I'm not hungry. You need to eat. Walk around. -You'll hurt me. How's your job? I told you, I need time to move. I don't get why you're selling the house. I need a change. Need money? I've never asked you for anything. I'll come back as soon as I can. The food is inedible. This is no good? I need to rest. Excuse me. My mother's not eating. When did you last see her? She has more and more trouble swallowing. Can't you do something? We give her the best possible care. It's between her and her doctor. I'll be back soon. You're too early. That's why you can't catch the bar. -OK. Micha, come here. Please. Put on gloves. Hold the rope with me. Once again. Same movement. Push. Watch the first sequence. Once again. Not bad. Push harder. Forward. Your rhythm is off. Pick up your pace. That way you get higher. At half-turn, watch the trapeze. Very important. Balance. Push harder. Forward. The rehearsal went well today. Nice work. You're pretty confident. The only thing I might suggest is to go looser when he's swinging and pull harder when he gets to the trapeze. But it's good in general. I hope you can come to the next rehearsal. Yeah, OK. That will be all for today. See you soon. -Bye. See you tomorrow. Get up, please. The sheets are dirty. I'm hungry. I said I'm hungry. My phone... Yes, for a delivery. Bleury Square. Twentieth floor. All-dressed. One. Yes, large. Make it fast, OK? Thanks. Bye. Come in. Are you hungry? Are you hungry? Yes. What? Yes! Say please. Please. What? Please! You can go now. You're dehydrated. Open your mouth. Mom... That's it, slowly. Someone help! Hurry! Hurry! She's dying of thirst. Next time, call us if you need anything. I don't get it. -Yeah. It's OK, we'll take care of you. It's good. Not bad. Want to work the show? If you like. Then you'll have to hold the rope yourself. You can do it. Push. Come on, go. That's good. -A bigger swing. That's good. A bit less spread at the end. Don't rush the backward swing. That's good. Nice balance. That's it, not bad. Nice rotation. OK, next. OK, come down. Not bad. Nice work today. Where were you? You weren't here. I had things to do. I'm cold. I'm freezing. Hit me. Hit me! Yeah? Oh. Yeah. Please sign here. Here. The attendant will prepare the room.

No. You pull with your other hand. So I can do it with my leg? Yeah. You shorten it by about 30 cm? Yes, about that. I think he'll do a good job. It'll go well. Ready? -Yeah. I think you're ready. Take that. -OK. Célien, are you OK? Can you hear me? Go get the first aid kit and call 9-1-1, please. OK, try to breathe, Célien. Tell me where it hurts. OK, your arm. What are we doing here?
