[instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [woman] Alice. Alice? Look at this mess. Oh, look at my kitchen. Sweetheart, what are you doing? Oh, you're always making messes. Let me see your hands. Okay, go wash up. Stay in your room. You make a mess out of everything you touch. Charlie, say somethin'. I thought we were safe. You know, you, you-you had protection. When did this happen? How far along are you? Twelve weeks? I don't know. -Twelve or thirteen. -Oh. Which means I'm having this baby in December. [chuckles] Well, I'm gonna be going into my spring semester with a baby. [whispers] Charlie, I'm 20. I don't know how to be a mom. Do you even wanna think about options? I mean, I, I know I don't wanna mess up some poor kid's life. You're not gonna mess anything up. All right? That's your mom talkin'. But we already screwed up the plan. This wasn't supposed to happen first. We're, we were supposed to get married, we were supposed to, to have a few years together, you know? My gosh, my mom's gonna kill me. Babe, when I tell her, she's never gonna speak to me again. Do you wanna keep this baby? -Only if it's a boy. -What? -Babe? -Listen, I'm kidding. Come-come here. Give me your hands. Listen... Okay. Look at me. Look at me. Hey, hey. Okay. This is not the worst thing that could happen, you know? I'm, I'm, I'm... I'm half way through my twenties. I think I'm ready. Yeah. Yeah. I do. And I think you're ready, too. -We can do this. -[chuckles] We got this. -Okay. -Okay? Ah... When I tell my mom that I'm having a baby and we're not married, she's... My parents are not gonna be happy with me. Okay. Well, let's do that, then. I-I wasn't, I promise, I wasn't trying to talk you into anyth-- I know, but I'm serious. Let's get married right now. Justice of the Peace. [chuckles] Come on. What about a wedding? My poor mother has been planning the thing since before I was born. Um, babe, I know, a-and... Well, truthfully, I feel like we're kinda past that now, right? I mean, we, you, we're havin' a baby. [chuckles] And we gotta do it right. No, I know. You're right. You're right. So... But you haven't even proposed yet. [sighs] We can't just go to the courthouse. -There's a lot of girls-- -Will you marry me? -Charlie, I love you. -I love you. -We don't have to rush into-- -I'm not, um... I got things a little out of order. I realize that, but, um... [mellow music] I'll be right back. Babe. Babe. -[Charlie] How are you? -Fine. How are you? -Fantastic. I... Well... -What can I do for you? [indistinct chatter] -Can I have that? -Sure. Excellent service. Thank you. [indistinct chatter] Yup. Okay. [clears throat] -What are you doing? -Give me your hands. -Babe. -Give me your hands. I'll live only for your happiness. For your love, I would give my last breath. -[whispering] Not here. -Shh... As long as I live, I will love you. I promise you this. There is nothing I wouldn't give from this moment on. Ali, will you marry me? I hope you know what you're getting yourself into. Are you saying yes? Yes, yes, I'll marry you. Yeah? Ah. Okay. All right. So listen. Oh, baby, you-you, you really, you don't have to put that on. This is gonna be great. [Alice chuckles] Please. I mean, you're insane. I'm marrying a... Okay, don't get... Just don't get too attached to that. That's... I'm gonna replace that soon. I really do love you. I really do love you, too. [music continues] -Uh... Wha-- -Did... Did you just propose with Shania Twain lyrics? Yes. Yes, I did. But you can't take it back now. It's too late. She said yes, everybody! -I know you guys were watching. -[crowd applauding] [Alice] Is he healthy? Mm-hmm. Sure is. Sorry about the scare. You have a nice-sized little boy. -[chuckles] -And you're due? Oh, the doctor says eight weeks, but I think he'll come early. Every first-time mama thinks they're gonna deliver early. They're like, "There's no way I can get any bigger than I already am," but they do. -Really? -Mm-hmm. [sighs] This scare just made me realize how much I really do want him here. Yeah, there's nothing like the first time you see that baby. Oh, you have kids? -Mm-hmm. -How many? I have two. I just gave birth to my second. -Few months ago. -Oh... [sighs] I seem to want him to be here, but then at, at the same time, I don't know what to do when he does get here, you know? And more than anything, I just don't wanna-- Honey, you don't have to be afraid of a child. You're going to a great mom. You're gonna mess up, yes. All you gotta do is love 'em and put the fear of God in 'em as they grow. I don't know, I don't know what is about motherhood that just has me so... I don't know, second-guessing myself, I just... Uh, I mean, I-I know I need to get diapers and we need to finish safe-proofing the house 'cause we're not done with that yet, but-- I say you need Jesus more than all that stuff. Do you go to church? I-I did when I was younger, but, you know, it's-it's been a while. Tell you what, tell your husband that your new friend, Teresa, invited you to church. Give me a call and tell me what he says. -Yeah. Um, okay. -All right. -[Teresa chuckles] -Teresa. Why don't you finish getting cleaned up, take your time, and you better not forget to call me. -Okay. Bye. -Bye. [instrumental music] [woman] Well, you have to read it. You have-- I'm not gonna read it and you can't make me! [woman] Christopher, I'm gonna count to three. And if you don't quit your whining, I'm gonna leave you here at the library. [boy] Stop pulling my arm! [woman] That's one. [boy] No, it's not. [woman] Yes, it is. [mother] Did you get the books? [kids] Yes, ma'am. -Your first? -Yeah. How exciting. You make it look so easy. [chuckles] Yeah, well, it isn't. James, grab your sister's hand, stop by the front door please. But it's worth it, God gives us grace and strength, and each child is a blessing. -You enjoy yours. -Thank you. I will. All right, kids. Inside voices. So I feel like you've got enough diapers for three babies. Is there something you're not telling me right now? -No. -No? We just have to be prepared, this is a living human being we're having here. Yeah, it's a, it's a baby, you know? We're not the first people to be parents. The thing eats and sleeps and then pees and poops in the first year, that's about it, right? Ali, we got this thing outnumbered. It's like basketball, right? There's two of us, we're big people, two grown-ups against one little-bitty baby. [Charlie] We got this. Does it not scare you at all to be a parent? Nope. Not really. Okay, maybe a little bit. But I figure it'll just come naturally, you know? We'll roll with it. [sighs] I just don't wanna turn out like my mom. What if I screw up my kid? You are not your mom. You never will be. And besides, I like how you turned out. Yeah. Do you mean pregnant? Not sure many people would agree with you on how I turned out. Besides, doesn't everybody say that they're not gonna do what their parents did, and then they, ah, they turn out just like 'em? Ali, moms have been raising babies for centuries. And you got all these books you've checked out, the magazines that you've bought and the horrible talk shows you've been watching. -Hey. -We'll figure it out. Okay? And listen, worst case, if we got questions, we find somebody who has the answers. Yeah, a nurse who was doing the ultrasound today, she's a mom of two, and she was, she was awesome. -She gave me her number. -See? Great. Call her. Take her to coffee, pick her brain. She invited us to, uh, go to church. -Huh! -I mean... Some churches have mommy groups that women can go to, or like a-a mommy's-day-out program. It, it might, it might be a really good way to, to get some help. Does it start early on Sundays? Because you know I like to sleep in. That's not all you like to do on Sunday mornings. [laughs] Hey, look, I'm not the only-- Anyways, your days of sleeping in are coming to an abrupt halt, mister. I can't do this alone. I really think it might be a good idea if we start going. [mellow music] Okay. [sighs] Thank you, sweetheart. Well, I do have to finish this crib, otherwise this kid's not gonna have a place to sleep. It looks like you're pretty much done to me. -Yeah, does it? -Mm-hmm. -Okay. -[Alice chuckles] Hey, I need you to install the car seat... [soulful music] -Hey, you all right? -[breathing heavily] [doctor] All right, take the breaths and let's push him out. -Do it. Now push, push. -[doctor] Push hard! Push hard! [doctor] Push hard. You got it! You got it! You've got a baby. That's it. [baby bawling] [Alice sighing] Ronnie. [Charlie] He's beautiful. [instrumental music] Hey, Christie, I'm here to pick up Kate, uh, Morris. Um, I'm afraid... Katie was a little out of hand this morning. She hit two of the other children with wooden blocks. [bawling] Mommy! I'm so sorry. Well, we tried to get her to calm down, but she doesn't seem to understand that you cannot throw wooden blocks at other people, including me. So I thought you might wanna address that. Of course. Yeah. You know our policy is if kids keep hitting, then we have to have a parent stay with them during the service or else the child has to sit with mom and dad in, um, big church until their next birthday. I completely understand, um... I-I-I'll talk with my husband, and i-it won't happen again. All right. Thank you. [baby bawling] [Ronnie] Mommy, mommy, I'm gonna be an assassin when I grow up. And then and... And I'm not gonna have a name so the police can't find me, and I'm gonna hack into the computer and I'm gonna steal all the government's secret plans, and then I'm gonna blow up a Death Star, and then destroy all the monsters in the ocean. Hey, mommy, what do you want for your birthday? For you to not be a complete screw-up for one day, Ronnie! [Kate bawling] [somber music] [Kate bawling] [door slams] Honey, you okay? -[Alice] I just need a minute. -[Kate bawling] -Daddy. -Okay. Hey, buddy. How you doing? Uh, Kate's got poop on her back. [Alice] Yeah, well, when is she not covered in poop? Can you, can you please just change her so I can have five minutes alone? -Momma! -Okay. Hey, let's give mommy a second. Uh, let me go change her real quick, okay? Then I'll come check... Oh, that's, that's awful. [Kate] Mama! [groaning] Wipes. Where... [Kate whimpering] -[Kate bawling] -Oh, Kate. Stop. Stop moving. You've done enough. Hey. Hey, I'll do it. -I'll do it. -I got this. I don't want you changing her when you're upset. Yeah, well, you locked yourself in the bathroom and said you needed help, so I'm helping. I just needed a minute. I can do my job, thank you. [Kate sobbing] -Hey. -Whatever. Hey, Teresa and Kenneth are gonna be here at 6:30. -How long do burgers take? -Perfect night for company. Like, 30 minutes. I'll get into it. Hey, one more thing. Can you come back here for a minute? Sure. Tonight we need to talk about Kate. She was, I guess, hitting other kids in church yesterday and they said that they might have to actually kick her out of nursery. Kick her out of nursery? That's crazy. She's two. -That's what two-year-olds do-- -Yeah, well, let's just... Let's just talk about it tonight after they have left. [sighs] Kate and Ronnie have been running the house lately and it is, it-it is wearing me out. I'm sure it's a phase. She'll grow out of it. -Talk to Teresa about her. -I don't think it's a phase. The other kids are not hitting each other. And we are her parents. We're supposed to fix things like this. I, I don't want to talk to Teresa. I wanna talk to you about it. I wanna talk to my husband. I want to hear your ideas. I-I cannot do everything by myself. Okay, we'll talk about it. Great. I'm so glad you're interested in your kids' lives. Hey. Quiet out here. Yeah, I know. Kinda nice, isn't it? Yeah, tell me about it. With three under six, the sound of nothing can be pretty sweet. Honestly, I don't know how you guys do it. Ronnie and Kate are almost too much for Ali as it is. -What about you? -Oh, I'm fine with two. No, I'm talking about the stress. -Does it get to you? -I just tune it out. I know, man, but, hey, I work and come home, I gotta unwind. You don't think Alice is tired, too? I'm sure she is, but I don't know, quick trips, I just... I don't know, takes it out of me, man. Well, look, man, I get it, all right? When it comes to raising kids, the days are long, but the years are short. Not short enough, if you ask me. You remember the challenge that Pastor Mark gave us on Sunday? -Nah, I was out of town. -You were out of town. Well, look, he, uh, quoted some guy that said, "Children are the living messages that we send forth to a time that we will not see." Hm. You should get the tape. He talks about giving a vision for what God might have for your kids. Something more than hoping that they grow up happy and healthy and get a good job and get married. Oh. I think I burnt these. Yeah, I hear you, man. It got me to realize that our kids aren't the problem. It's us, man. Yeah, uh, y-you and me, that's right. I'm the problem? Remember that verse that says, "Without a vision, the people will perish?" Can't say that I do. Well, it applies to the family as well. You can't run around living life one day at a time. You gotta know where you're going, and then lead. [somber music] All right. All right. [Charlie] Gimme that ball. [Charlie] Literally pulls up from half-court and he makes it, just actually, this is something I do all the time. It was ridiculous. I saw the replay of that on the news. -Did you? -It was unbelievable. -It was, man, it was crazy. -Excuse me. -Yes, son? -I finished my food. Can I get a popsicle? Ms. Alice, John David has a question for you. Yes, John David? -May I please get popsicles? -Of course you can. They're in the freezer, on the bottom shelf. [Kate babbling] Your little man has become quite the gentleman. I want a popsicle, too. You can have one when all of your food's gone, buddy. But I can't eat it, it's too much food. I want a popsicle like John David. Son, your mother gave you an answer. You cannot have dessert until you finish your food. Sit down, finish your food. Do you mind if I try something? Go ahead. Now, Ronnie, you know your plate has to be empty before you go get dessert, right? Right? It looks like your plate's all empty, hon. I guess that means you get dessert. Can I get a popsicle now? Yes, you may. Thank you for asking. [indistinct chatter] [Kenneth] My dad did that with me once. Never forgot it. "That's the picture of grace," he would say. Getting what you don't deserve because somebody else did what you should have done for you. [Charlie] You just wanted to eat more hamburger, man. Don't be, don't get all spiritual on me over there. [laughs] You just remember that the next time you're makin' these hamburgers out there. We got more if you need it. You don't have to eat my kid's food all the time. -Bring him a popsicle. -[laughing] [Charlie] You steal my kid's hamburger. Just five more minutes and I'll help you with those dishes. Oh, no, no, no, no. You sit and rest. No, I can't have you doing all that extra-- -Ronnie wants to know-- -Did you hear us talking? -Excuse me, mama. -You're excused. -Ronnie wants to know can-- -May I... -May I play Frogger with him? -What's that? [Alice] Oh, it's just this little video game with frogs trying to, like, cross the road. It's-it's totally harmless. Yes, you can play Froggy with Ronnie. [chuckles] It's Frogger, mommy. Well, whatever it's called, yes, you can play for about ten minutes, and then we gotta go. Thank you. My mom said I can play! [chuckles] Kids. Hey, I'm sorry about Ronnie tonight. Hm... What for? His, his manners, or his lack of manners, I should say. Well, how does he normally act? I don't know, I guess... I guess I just don't notice it, you know, when it's just him and Kate, but I-I don't know why he just seems to always decide to act up whenever we have company around. John David used to be just the same. -Really? -Mm-hmm. It took us weeks to get him to learn basic table manners. 'Cause there ain't no kid gonna say things like please and thank you on their own. Yeah, well, you're gonna have to, uh, lend me whatever book you used to train him. Oh, you already got it, honey, and it's all in there. -In The Bible. -Oh, well... I guess I missed the chapter on manners. Well, how much time do you spend reading Proverbs or memorizing verses? I mean, I have all my kids learn Proverbs 23, 13 and 14 as soon as they are old enough to talk. "Do not withhold discipline from your children. Whom the Lord loves, he disciplines." Yeah, but I just, I don't know that I can intentionally hurt my child, though. Alice, listen, some of the greatest lessons in life come amidst pain. If there's no sting, then what you get is a spoiled child. And I know you don't want that. [somber music] [gunfire on video game] Hon, your son is watching you play that game. Well, can you take him in the other room with you? I-I have to run a bath for Kate. Can you not just pause your game and please deal with him? Hey, bro, why don't you go put your pajamas on and brush your teeth, and I'll-I'll come pray with you in a minute, okay? But why? Because it's time to go to bed. Got him. But why can't I just watch for a few more minutes? Buddy, this is a grown-up game, okay? I've told you that before. Now please, you gotta go to bed. Why? [loudly] Son, go to bed now, please. [crying] Honey. Charlie, I cannot believe you. -Come on. -[gunfire on video game] [gunfire on video game] [explosion on video game] [gunfire continues] [controller thuds] [somber music] I'm sure that you both realize that Ronnie's very bright. We've been tracking his test scores over the past four years, and he's in the 97th percentile in reading and language. He's in the 99th percentile in math, he's in the 99th percentile in science. So even though Ronnie's a freshman, we would like to encourage you to have him start taking the SAT now, and once a year, every year. I don't wanna create any false expectations, but students with these kinds of early scores often go on to become National Merit scholars. I'd imagine he will have his pick of college options, and many of those options will likely come with some very generous scholarships attached. You both should be very proud. Ninety-nine percentile. Did you have any idea he was that smart? I knew he got good grades and didn't have to work at it very hard. -Phew. -What do you think? Free college? I... Yeah, I'm into it. You know how he's been skipping youth group, saying that he needed to study? This whole time I thought he was making excuses because it's boring and the, the leaders tell him, treat him like he's in sixth grade. But he's actually been studying. Like, he's really smart. Yeah. He's free-college smart. I'm not sure we'll get that lucky with Kate or Josh or Faith. -[Alice] See you at home. -Love you. [thuds] What are you doing with my Master Zord set? Mom said I could use the Legos to build a fort for Freckle. That doesn't mean you take apart a Master Zord to build some stupid fort. It's not stupid, and mom said I could. She didn't say that. Now give it back. Mom said I could play with it. She's not your real mom, anyway. -Yes, she is. -Nuh-uh. Your real mom couldn't handle you. That's not true! That's what mom told me when we got you. -She did not! -Uh-huh. Here, take your stupid Legos. They're stupid anyway! [Faith] Mom! -[cell phone ringing] -[utensils clattering] Hey. You on your way? No, I'm not. I'm still at the office. Hey, how was your day? How late? How was your day is code for I'm going to be late. So just tell me how late. Okay, well, I-I do have another couple of hours of work to do on the Wilson project, and then I... -I should be able to get free. -Charlie, really? Listen, I know, but, uh, if I work hard, I can get it done by Friday and then no more late nights for a while. Yeah, well, I think this is, what, the tenth project you've said that on now. Hey, are you okay? No. No, not really. Josh and Faith had a big fight today, and Josh said some really horrible things to her. [Charlie] Like what? Like that I'm not her real mom. She's not little anymore, and I, and I don't know how to talk to her about her mom and why she ultimately gave her up. I need you to be home before Josh goes to bed, so you can talk with him. He ignores me. He needs to hear it from you. And I, and I don't know what to say to Faith either. So maybe we can do that together? -Yeah, okay. Love you. -[keyboard keys clacking] Kids, dinner! Is dad home yet? Um, that was, that was him on the phone. Um, he's, he's stuck on a project, so he's not gonna be back until late. He was supposed to take me to the mall tonight. Yeah, well, I don't think that's gonna happen, sweetie. I'm sorry. Can I call dad and see if we can go? Yes, but, um, we need to eat dinner first. Please go get the others. Tell them that it's time to eat. Okay. Ronnie, Josh, Faith, dinner! [sighs] Laundry belongs in the bin, not next to the bin. [sighs] I seem to make babies faster than I can pick up their laundry. -How do you make babies? -What? What? We're not talking about this. Go get your PJs on. But I need to go potty. Then go potty. What you readin'? Something for a class? Nope, just for fun. Hey, on Saturday, um, I was planning on going to a concert downtown with some friends. -What show? -Uh... It's a band called Nihil Fit. -Are they Christian? -Kind of. Their band name is Latin for nothing comes and their music has some spiritual themes. Okay. And who would you be going with? I don't think you know them. Justin Booth and Franklin Hauser? They're juniors. So they can give me a ride to the show. I think that should be fine, but let me just... Let me just talk with your dad before I let you know, okay? [Ronnie] Okay. -Night. -[Ronnie] Goodnight. -[instrumental music] -[line ringing] Hi, daddy, it's Katiebug. It's okay. I know you have really important things to do. I know the fair is Saturday. Do you think we could go? Thanks, daddy. She's putting everyone to bed. Love you, too, daddy. -Okay, turn it off. -Okay. -Put it up. -Okay. And here you go. So I wanna talk to you about the things that you said to your little sister today. I was just kidding with her. Honey, it's-it's not kidding if you tell her that I'm not her real mommy. Well, you're not. That's what you told me. Well, I'm not her birth mom, yes, but I am her real mommy. God had her planned for our family before she was even born. Well, why didn't he put her in your tummy? God just has different plans sometimes, that's all. Look, sweetie, I know that having a sister can be very, very frustrating, but Faith needs you to be a good big brother. Well, me and her don't even like the same things. Well, that's okay. Maybe you can help her with things, you know? You could maybe teach her cursive, 'cause you're really good at your letters. Or you could show her games on your iPad, or maybe show her pictures and tell her stories about our family. I can show her the place in the garage. Dad put a hole in the wall when we were moving in. Yes, yeah, y-y-you could, you could definitely show her that. You know what you need to do first, though? What? You need to tell her that you're very sorry and ask her to forgive you for the things you said. Do you remember how to do that? What do you say first? I say sorry. You say, "I'm sorry for..." I'm sorry for what I said. I was wrong. -Will you... -Will you please forgive me? And then what do you do? -Then I give her a hug. -[laughs] Perfect. We'll do that first thing in the morning, okay? -Okay. -Night, little buddy. -Goodnight, mom. -Sleep good. Josh, your shoes are by the door! hurry up! Sweetie, we gotta leave in five minutes. I've got an appointment at the office at 9:00. -Is your lunch almost packed? -Almost. Who are you texting this early in the morning? -It's a friend. -And her name is? His name is Adam, Lauren's older brother. Hey, Adam can wait five minutes until your lunch is packed and we are in the car. Hey. Morning, baby. How you doing? Did you sleep good? Did you sleep good? Did you sleep good? Did you sleep good? [chuckles] Hey, sweetheart. -Hey, dad. -Hey, baby, I gotta run. Um, I know I said I'd pick up the kids later, but I'm-I'm probably gonna have to work late. -[Alice] Babe-- -I know. I'm finishing it, though, so this'll be the last time for a while. Yeah, well, you said that last weekend. I mean it today. [Alice] Okay. Well, just be off tomorrow. The girls are counting on you. Oh, I wouldn't miss the fair with my girls. -You excited? -Yeah! Faith is coming? Yeah, dad and the girls at the fair. It's gonna be great. What do you think, Faith? You think we should get Kate to ride the teacups with us? -Yeah. -You up for-- You know what, you guys can just go ride the teacups together. Um... I'm gonna just go with some friends from school. It's probably a better idea, anyway. Mom, I'll be in the car. What's that about? Teacups? She loves teacups. You realize that she is 12 now? Faith, come on. Let's-let's go. Come on, come on. Josh, we're in the car! [mellow music] [birds chirping] [cell phone ringing] [Charlie] Yeah, I had 'em checked yesterday. They said they're fine. Yup, spare, too. Yeah, I know. We can Skype. I'll be home in, like, 11 weeks. -Mm-hmm. -[water running] All right, you too. See you. -Was that dad? -Mm. Yup. Know, he tried to take a later flight so he could be here. No big deal. He was here for the party last night. Yeah, well, I can't believe that they wouldn't let him miss a meeting so that he could be here to see his firstborn son off to college. Mom, it's no big deal. Hey, you need help with your stuff? [Ronnie] Got it. You know, your dad and I keep thinking that Dunwood is a mistake. You had your choice of a dozen schools. I... I don't see why you had to pick the most extreme. Mom, look, I know this is hard for you, letting go, but you've done your job. You raised me, okay? I stayed out of trouble, I got the grades, I got the full scholarship, tuition, room and board. You did good, okay? -Where do you want these? -Um, passenger seat. [instrumental music] Hey, are you looking through all my stuff? I was just looking at your baby picture, and... It's just a book, okay? I mean, you... You can't really know what you believe until you've read all the sides. And he teaches at Dunwood? I'm not gonna do this again with you, okay? The decision is made! Classes start on Thursday. Would you let it go? -Ronnie, what are you-- -Mom, let it go! Okay. Do you have your registration and everything in your glove compartment? That belongs to Matt. He put it there the other night. He just asked me to keep it for a few days. And you were just going to drop it off by his house on your way out on Monday morning? Exactly, so-- You are not leaving this driveway with drugs in your car. Do you have anymore of this stuff in here? Are you done? When your father finds out about this... Yeah, okay, whatever. [chuckles] [sighs] Hey, you guys know where to find me, all right? Look me up sometime. Reed Hall. Room 517. Bye, mom. Close the door. Ronnie. Ronnie! [engine revving] [instrumental music] [Kate] I had fun, Mike. I did too, Kate. Uh, I should probably go before my parents suspect anything. Oh! Just stay a little while longer. Uh, I don't know, I just don't wanna get caught. Your parents are probably in bed. Uh, yeah. -Come on. -I just... [exhales] I should probably go. You know he hasn't lost his phone. He just doesn't wanna talk to us. It's been three days. He'll cool off and call us back. Yeah, well, I think he's an atheist. And it's not just about the book. -He's a teenager, he's confused. -[distant shouting] I've read all kinds of books when I was his age. [Kate] Help! You hear that? [Alice] Hon, should I, should I call the police? No, I'll check it out. [intense music] [Kate] Mike, let go! [Kate] Please, let go! Let go! You're hurting my arm! Please... [grunts] [Charlie] Hey! -[engine revving] -[tires screeching] Hey! -Kate! -[panting] What happened? You all right? -I'm fine. -You okay? Who was that? -Yes, I'm fine. -Who was that? Did he hurt you? Hey, look at me. Are you okay? -Are you okay? -Yes, I'm fine, dad. -No, you're not. -Yes. [sobs] Come here, come here. [sobbing] -[door opens] -[footsteps approaching] Honey? What's going on? Katie? Katie, what are you doing out? -Sit down. -What is going on? Sit down. Answer your mother. -Kate? -I snuck out on a date. -What else? -Excuse me? What else happened? She snuck out on a date with a boy who pushed her out of his car. He did what? Who is this person? What... -You don't know him. -Oh, I'm gonna know him. That is not what I asked, missy. Who is he? -Katherine. -His name, his name is Mike! He's in college. -College? -[Faith] Mommy, I need water. -Katie, he's in college? -[Faith coughs] Katie, I am not happy about this. -I need medicine. -Well, you're not through. -Come on. Where's your cup? -[Faith coughs] [Alice] I had your medicine right by your bed. -Did you not take it? -[Faith] It's gone. [Faith] I don't know where it is. This isn't the first time you've done this, is it? No. Well, it's the last time. You're grounded. Your mom and I will talk about for how long. Typical. -What did you say? -Look, Mike's a good guy. This is the first time anything has happened. Good guys don't push people out of their car, Katie. Yeah, well, I can take care of myself. Really? Like tonight? -Yeah. -Well done. Like tonight, and like every other night when you're at work and mom's at home taking care of Faith and Josh by herself. I'm fine. I picked you up off the sidewalk, Kate! Does that sound fine to you? You know what, this is going nowhere. -Sit down! -Can you just leave me alone? I'm not done talking to you! Just leave me alone! [Kate grunts] [Alice] Katherine, come here. [Kate] No. [Alice] You kn-- [Kate] No! I don't wanna talk to you right now. Don't care if you don't wanna talk to me. Who is this person? How did you... [Kate] Don't you ever talk to me again! [Alice] Katherine! [Kate] Oh, my God! -Don't talk to me! -[door slams] [somber music] [Charlie] How come I didn't know about this boy? Because we've been giving her space. I feel like all I've heard for the past two years, "Mom, gimme space." Yeah, well, look where space got us. I just wanna know, how did I not... We need help, Charlie. I can fix this. Okay, then, what's your plan? I'm gonna spend some time with her. Some one-on-one time, some real time, with Kate... and the other kids. I can, you know, really make an effort, which I haven't. -Then I can cut back. -Babe, we've tried that. Please, we need something that's gonna last more than two weeks. It will. I'm serious. Honey, the only reason that Kate is still here is because she is too young to leave. She's gonna brush you off just like she does me. She wants less of us in her life, not more. Honey, we have got to get help. We have two more coming up after her. And she's following right after Ronnie, and they're gonna follow right after her. [Charlie] Started drifting away and, and doing his own thing, and I just thought it was normal young adolescence stuff. I know our jobs as parents is to make sure our kids are well taken care of and, and keep them out of trouble. -Right? -Yeah. Teresa and I began to realize that maybe we had our priorities all wrong. Look, we were looking at the spiritual development of our children as only a part of their lives, but not the centerpiece. Man, we cared more about how they acted than we did about teaching them what loving and trusting and walking with Jesus every day looks like. What they learned from us was how to stay away from sin. Don't mess up, and if you do, don't, don't, don't tell anybody or else you'd be in big trouble. Man, we taught them how to hide their sin rather than confess it. They never saw us confessing anything. I can't get my kids to talk to me, let alone confess anything, so-- Here is your catfish and fries for you, and catfish and slaw for you. You guys need anything else? -We're good, thank you. -Okay, enjoy. Teresa and I were talking the other night, and she thinks that, we think that maybe it'd be a good idea for the, uh, four of us to get together and go to that new parenting series at church. -I just-- -I know. I know we'll probably be the oldest ones in the group, all right? But it can't hurt to sit in on a few sessions, now can it? [sighs] Okay. -Yeah? -Yeah, I'll do it. Let's do it. Good. Good. Now, now can you pray over the food so I can eat my catfish, please? -Sure. -[laughs] Uh, God, thank you for the food and for friends... and our kids. Thanks for doing this. -Hey! -Excuse me. [indistinct chatter] [man] Okay, come on in. It's getting started. We wanna welcome you to the Art of Parenting video series, presented by Family Life. Here's what the schedule's gonna look like. We're gonna watch a video for about a half... Hey, here we go. [man] ...and we'll break out into some mini-sessions. I think most parents in America say, "I want my kids to be happy" and, or, "I want them to be successful." [woman on video] And I feel like, oh, my gosh, that's not good enough. Happiness is just an emotion that comes and goes. [man on video] What does happiness look like? Um, it's kind of difficult to answer. [instrumental music] [music continues] Kate, can you come down here for a minute? [Kate] Yeah. Uh, one sec. -Yeah, what's up? -Have a seat. Uh, okay. [clears throat] Well, your mom and I, um, have come to realize that our faith and believing in God needs to be more than just going to church on Sundays or praying before we go to sleep. That God doesn't just need to be a part of our life, but that He needs to be the center of it. What does that mean? That's a good question, and, honestly, um, we're still trying to figure that out, too. Well, I think, for most of our marriage we have, we've tried to do the right thing, and we figured that if we were, we were doing that, if everything was going okay, that, that we were on track. Yeah, we... We just, w-we thought we just had to do our best and turn to God when things aren't working or you get stuck. But that's not the way it is. We've been learning a lot about this book, The Bible, and that this is what God wants us to spend time in every day, so that we can learn more about Him. This is how He teaches us about Himself, and this is how we learn His plan for us. Jesus said that we... we need God's word more than we need food. -Nuh-uh. -Yeah. Yeah, I know, it's-it's, it's hard to believe, but it's true. You know, our souls hunger for these words the way that our body hungers for food. I want us, as a family, to start spending time every single day reading the Bible together. I try to read my Bible sometimes, but there's a lot of words in there that I don't know what they mean. [laughs] I unders... You know, there's a lot of words in here that I don't know what they mean either. But I bet if we dive in together, we can figure it out. Okay? I tell you what. Why don't we start, why don't we start now? Go get your Bibles and we'll dive in and just read a few versus, and-and, and go from there, okay? Go ahead. Well, we'll see if this does any good. Hon, you're doing great. We just have to remember that our job is to be faithful. Change is up to God. Yeah. -[instrumental music playing] -[knocking on door] [Charlie] Hey, you got a minute? Mm-hmm. [music stops] [Charlie sighs] Kate, I messed up. Um, I haven't been as involved in your life as I should have been. You have grown into a beautiful young woman. And somewhere along the way I quit being your dad. [mellow music] You know, when you were little, [sighs] I knew what to do. We-we would go get ice cream, I would just push you on the swing while you said, "Higher, daddy, higher." And then you stopped... wanting to go to the park, you know? And I guess I just, I starting thinking maybe my job was over. That was wrong. That was really wrong. [Kate sniffles] You were on that sidewalk the other night... because of me. I wasn't here for you... and I stopped protecting you. Will you forgive me? I'm so sorry. I forgive you, dad. I have something to say to you, too. -Okay. -Um, I... I'm sorry I snuck out with Mike. I knew that it was wrong, but I just, [sighs] it was nice to have a guy paying attention to me... making me feel special. I know it caused you guys a lot of stress. Can you forgive me, too? Of course. -Buds? -Buds. -Pals? -Pals. BFFs? Okay, nobody says that anymore. What do they say now? Uh, I don't know, like, "Dudes." -I don't know. [laughs] -Dudes? -Don't call me that. -[laughs] Ice cream date? -Mm. -Okay. I'll have to check my calendar. Gotta check your calendar? [Kate] Yeah. [laughs] [Charlie] Okay. Pencil me in. Here, try this. Okay. -That's amazing. -Thanks. Yeah, no, I'm actually, I'm really impressed. I still need to try it with less garlic, I think. Or add it in earlier. -How old are you? -I'm ten, dad. You're ten? Oh, that's right, that's right. Because you're talking like you're 35. You know, I think we should try to find a way for you to make some money doing this. -For real? -Yeah. -How? -Well, I have an idea. You know how mom goes to Bible study... -On Monday nights at the church? -Mm-hmm. What if you made dinner for the family every Monday? -That'd be awesome! -Yeah? Now we'd have to plan ahead, make sure you have what you need. But I'm thinking, if you cook for everybody and then you clean everything up, I'd be willing to give you five dollars a week to do that. -How about ten dollars a week? -[laughs] Are you negotiating with me already? -Yeah. -No, no, no. I'm gonna stick at five. -Okay. -For now. But if you made extra, then we could take some to Mr. McBride from church as well. I bet he'd love to have a meal cooked from you, okay? -Mm-hmm. -That sound good? -Yeah. -Yeah? Are you excited? -Yeah. -Okay. Keep going, I wanna eat more. Good, man. Number five, "What have you done to show your children that they are special and unconditionally loved?" Hm, well, I've been spending some time with Josh, helping him with his cooking. He's pretty good. How's it been for you? Hard... at first. You know, he, um... I guess I never really looked at cooking as something that men did. But I-I am learning that I can't make him... what I want him to be. Well, how's it been for him? He's, he's really opening up. It's been really good. [instrumental music] What are you working on? -Katie's arrow. -Hm. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. You're not gonna, you're not gonna copy off of my work. I thought we were supposed to do this together. Uh, ultimately, yes, but I would really, I think that we should each do our own first draft. And I see what you're, I see what you're doing here. Whatever, whatever you come up with, I'll be so fine with. Mm-hmm. Yes, but that's... You're not gonna get out of your homework that easy. -Gosh, you're no fun. -Ah, I'm fun sometimes. [Alice] I wrote that she's considerate and sensitive, and something that I want to work on her with is cultivating a sense of belonging. [Charlie] I have that Faith is inventive and persistent.

[Charlie] You're telling me. -[laughs] [instrumental music] -Hey, sweetheart. -Hey. Get everything unloaded? Unloaded, set up. Looks good. Thanks. Hey, I wanna show you something. [sniffles] Kate was the one who found it. [music continues] -Is that Ronnie? -[Alice] Yeah. Who is the little guy? -Is that-- -He looks just like you. [voice cracking] Is that his? He has a son? Well, what else do you know besides this picture? [Alice] Kate was looking around, and, um, from what she could tell, it looked like Ronnie didn't even know he was a dad in, until, like, a couple of weeks ago. Looks like the mom dropped the little guy off with him at his place. -Where's that? -Someplace in Oregon. Did you call? Did you call him? [Alice] Yeah, I left a message. -What'd you say? Nothing, nothing out of the ordinary. You know, I didn't, I didn't let on, uh, that I had seen a picture or anything. Hon, are you okay? -I have a grandson. -[chuckles] [sniffles] We're grandparents. [sighs] Those are the only pictures that we have. A-any reason to think that he will be... Is he gonna be there... at the wedding, do you think? No. No, I, I don't think so. [instrumental music] Hey. [exhales sharply] Father... [sniffles] we pray for our, we pray for our boy. We don't know where he is, Father, but you do. And, God, we thank you for the blessing of a grandson. A grandson. And we pray that you will protect him... from any harm or evil... that may come his way, God, somehow... [whispering] somehow, that he will come to know you at a young age, that he will learn to love you and to walk with you and to trust you with his whole life. Father, we pray again for our boy, Ronnie, Father. My boy. Bring him home... Father. Bring him home. Help him see... the folly of his sin, Father, and the reality of your love and the reality of our love. It's in your son's name we pray. Amen. [whispers] Amen. -We have a grandson! -[laughs] Oh! Oh! [Ronnie on voicemail] Uh, hey, this is Ronnie. I can't get to the phone right now. -Honey... -Leave me a message. Honey, if you're gonna talk to the bride, you need to go do it now. I don't think he's coming. [instrumental music] Just remember, you're on the left, he's on the right. [laughs] Come here. Mm. I'm not supposed to be touching your dress. It's okay. Listen. Today is a big day for daddy. He probably won't show it, but on Monday when you guys are back at home and I'm not there, he'll probably try to act like he's not sad. But he'll be sad, a little sad. He only has one little girl at home now, and that's you. But I'm not a little girl anymore. You are to him. Even though you're 13, he's still gonna need those hugs from you. He needs to know you haven't gotten too cool for him, okay? -Mm-hmm. -[both laughing] And when you get to be my age and you meet a cute boy, just like Rick, who loves Jesus, and he asks you to marry him, you make sure you get daddy's blessing before you run off and get married. And remember, whoever you marry has to wanna live no more than 30 miles from mom and dad. -Really? -[knocking on door] [laughs] I'm kidding. But help your dad. [Charlie] Ladies? Excuse me, miss. Um, have you seen my daughter Kate anywhere? No, no, no, this can't, this can't be her. This is an angel. You look gorgeous. Thank you, daddy. Hey, um, Faith, can you give us a minute? Why don't you go see if you can help mommy? Are you ready for all this? 'Cause we can call this thing off right now. Dad, dad. -So Ronnie, I don't think he's-- -Dad, I know. It's okay. We'll just keep praying for them, for both of them now. -Kate, I just, I wanted to-- -Dad... I'm not going to let this steal the joy of this day... and you shouldn't either. Hey, sorry to interrupt. Kate, honey, they need you out front before the guests arrive. Tell them I'll be right there. No, you go. -Are you sure? -Yeah, we can talk later. Everything look okay, mom? You look perfect, honey. -Come on, I'll walk you out. -Okay. -Love you. -Love you, too. Love you, too. [instrumental music] [indistinct chatter] I love you, daddy. It's okay. I love you so much, Katie. [Charlie] "Katherine Grace Morris, now Katherine Grace Johnson, is a testament to the saving grace and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ. Having received this blessing from the Lord 20 years ago, I have faithfully taught her to love God with all of her heart, soul and strength. Katherine has proved herself to honor God and authority, to live responsibly, to hunger and thirst for righteousness, to be a proper helpmeet, to seek reconciliation and forgive quickly, to obey the Lord and all His holy will. I hereby give thanks and praise to God for this blessing, [voice cracking] and in the presence of our Lord, I declare, to God be the glory. I also declare that on this day, Katherine Grace Johnson..." I know. "given to me by God as an arrow in my quiver, is hereby... released... into the world... now in the hands and the direction of her husband, on mission for the Lord, by the Lord, and of the Lord, to make a difference for Him... and our generation. May she be the mother of tens of thousands, and her legacy continually bless future generations for the glory of God." Amen. [instrumental music] I love you. [voice cracking] I love you, too, daddy. -And I got my eye on you. -[laughing] [line ringing] [automated response] Incoming call. [Kate] Ronnie, it's Kate again. Just calling to see if you're going to make it to mom and dad's 50th next week or not. I talked to your son Tim and he and Elizabeth are coming. Ronnie, listen, you don't want to get a voicemail at some point and learn that one of them is gone and, and you never... I don't know. Just come, okay? [instrumental music] [Alice] What in the world have you done? My internationally acclaimed strawberry French toast. Made from an old family recipe that I dug up online about 20 minutes ago. [laughs] I bet the kitchen is a disaster. Ah, in a half-hour it will be spotless. No, I'll take care of it once I eat this beautiful breakfast. Your son would be so proud. [laughs] Josh would be surprised that I can cook anything for breakfast besides Pop-Tarts. Do they still make those things? I have no idea. Well, anyway, this looks a lot better than Pop-Tarts. Well, whatever inspired you to make me such a special breakfast? I have no idea. I was just sitting at the kitchen table, reading Joshua 9. Oh, is that so? Happy 50th... to the only woman I've ever loved. Oh, my Charlie. You're the only man I've ever loved. Well, you should go ahead and eat before, uh, my world-famous French Toast gets cold. [chuckles] Okay. Mm. [instrumental music] That looks great, guys. Let's put it out the first 30 or so. We'll ice the rest of them, pull them out of the fridge as needed. -Okay. -All right. [girl] Is that her? [girl laughs] -Hooray, you're here. -Hello. Oh, Faith, it is so good to see you. -You, too. -Oh. And you guys are so grown up! Say hello to your Aunt Kate. -Hello. -Hi, auntie. -Hello, Aunt Kate! -Hello. Aw! When we're done, we're gonna put all these in the freezer. Dad! Hey, it's good to see you. -Hi, honey. -Hi, mom. Oh, you look great. -Aw, thank you. -Look at all this food. Josh, we could feed everybody for a month with all this. Well, we're gonna have some leftovers, but that's no problem, we'll take care of it. I think you may have gone over the budget that I gave you. Well, actually, uh, we are far under budget. -This is my gift to you guys. -Oh, Josh-- -Yeah. -Now, son, I-- No, no, listen, how often does a caterer get to serve his parents on their 50th anniversary? Now, dad, I know you did something special for mom, right? He brought me breakfast in bed this morning. Oh, really? That's impressive. Cornflakes? I'll have you know I made strawberry French toast. And your mom gave the meal a ten. I gave it an A for effort. [laughs] I really think the reason he cooked for me this morning was because he knew he was gonna be accountable to you today. -Not so. Not so. -[laughing] [instrumental music] [automated response] Ronnie's calling. -[cell phone chimes] -Ronnie? Hey, sis. [clears throat] Um, I missed the first flight, but got on a follow-on. Sorry I missed your calls. But you're on your way? Yeah, I'll be there. -[Kate on phone] Ronnie? -Yeah. Kate, I'm sorry that-- Don't mind any of that. Uh, today it's about mom and dad. I haven't even told them you're coming yet. [Ronnie] I'll surprise 'em. [Kate on phone] Okay. [Kate on phone] I'll see you soon. [cell phone chimes] [music continues] [indistinct chatter] [Charlie] It wouldn't have been the same without you. [Kenneth] Hey. [Charlie] You guys fly or drive? [Kenneth] Well, we ended up flying. Flying ain't what it was ten years ago. [Charlie] Better or worse? Have you seen him? Rick's waiting for him at the door. We should probably get started soon. These kids aren't gonna last all night. Yeah, you're probably right, um... I'll get daddy to do the blessing. Okay, thanks. -Cold out there. -Hey, Ronnie? I'm Rick. I'm Kate's husband. -Guess I missed the dinner? -[laughs] Trust me, there's plenty of food left over. Everyone's inside and they're just now starting to share their tributes, so come on. Um, listen, I-I don't wanna interrupt what's going on. Is there a place where I can listen in without all of a sudden being the center of attention? [laughs] I'm way ahead of you. Got the perfect spot picked out. So in honor of your amazing 50 years together, your children decided to take a minute and let you know just how much you mean to us. We thought it best to find a way to preserve our thoughts for you. [Kate] We decided to go in age order from the youngest to oldest. And this is what Faith wrote. [instrumental music] Mom and dad, I have had many years to think of what my life might have been if you two had not made me a part of a forever family. I've read about the lives of the children who spend their childhood in orphanages. Chen and I know firsthand that even the best orphanages can never give a child all the things you gave me. Your whole life was about giving to our family. You gave us so much. But today I wanna thank you for the three most important things you gave me. First, you gave me the gift of security. As a child, I knew that whatever happened in my day, even if it was a pesky, bratty brother tormenting me, I would always have a mom and dad that would show me unconditional love. I remember the time when I was eight, when I packed my little suitcase and I told you I was moving back to China. I remember you telling me, mom, that you would leave my room the way it was, just in case things didn't work out for me in China. That's all I really wanted to hear. I never made it out the door. I had a home. You gave me a place to belong, and a family to belong to. When people who could tell I looked different from my siblings would ask how long I'd been in the family, I remember you telling them, dad, that God had determined I would be a Morris long before any of us were born. Even when I struggled with my identity as a teenager, you kept reminding me of what is true, that my identity isn't found in the color of my skin or the city where my birth parents lived. You taught me that my true identity is as a child of God. And that's the third gift you gave me. [music continues] [voice breaking] You gave me the gift of a living faith. [sniffles] You made sure we were all in church. You were, dad, you were faithful to read the Bible to us. [sniffles] But the loudest sermon I heard growing up was the one both of you preached by the way you walked. I learned what it looks like to believe in God and walk with Him every day by watching how you walked with Him. I know my siblings were stunned when they found out that their adopted sister was actually your favorite child. [all laughing] But I wasn't surprised at all. I knew it was true. So thank you for all the gifts you've given me. Chen and I pray that heritage you've given us will become a mighty legacy that will live for generations, through our children and our children's children. I love you, mom and dad. Your daughter forever, Faith. [instrumental music] Well, I originally was going to title mine "A Tribute From Your Favorite Child." But, uh, I didn't wanna crush Faith with the truth, so I ended up calling it "Here's To My Imperfect But Faithful Parents, From Your Very Imperfect Son." "In the Bible, the apostle Paul said, "I am who I am by the grace of God." And I can say the same, except, I have a second part to that phrase. I am who I am by the grace of God and because of the faithfulness of my mom and dad. My parents learned early that their third-born was stubborn and strong-willed. Dad, I remember you used to love telling people that when I was a child, I drew a circle around myself and called myself the Lord of the Ring. But we both knew that there was more truth there than either of us wanted to admit. But I think the biggest lesson I learned from you as you tried to redirect all my rambunctious impulses was that in the end, people matter more than things. Relationships matter more than always having to be right. And love matters most. And you both taught me that by how you faithfully loved your sometimes hard-to-love son. So in the end, that will be your legacy, and there could be no greater legacy than a legacy of faithful love. I love you two very much. Your son, Josh." [instrumental music] -I'm proud of you, son. -I know, dad. Thank you. [Alice] You make it sound harder than it was. Your memory's failing you, mom. [laughs] So I decided not to include in my tribute about being the favorite child, because, you know, that was our secret. And I know how to keep a secret. So, Faith and Josh, I am sure you are really the favorite children. My tribute is called "My Two Moms And Dads." "When I was 15, I got a new mom and dad. My, my old mom and dad, um, they were loving and kind, caring and gentle. My new mom and dad, um, well, they were also loving and kind, but I didn't realize it at the time. I, in fact, didn't care for my, uh, new parents all that much. They, uh, put new boundaries in place. They said no to things that they normally said yes to. But there was something about this new set of parents. They, uh, didn't rattle easy. They had an inner peace. They had new priorities. And they calmly and quietly went about reshaping our family. And in that process, they showed me what it means to live my life in Jesus, instead of trying to find a place for Jesus in my life. Mom and dad, I can't express to you how grateful I am for all the fun times, the love, memories... and most of all, the model that you showed me... how to walk humbly with your God. I love you. Your daughter, Kate." [Alice] That was beautiful. [sniffles] [music continues] Well, before we cut the cake, there's something I wanna say about it. Uh, we wanted to do something very special for mom and dad, uh... [Ronnie] Josh, I realize I'm... kinda late... here tonight. Like about, uh, 30-some-odd years late. And... Kate said something, uh, about tributes when I talked to her last. I mean, I guess I probably didn't listen all that carefully to her. That's been an issue, uh, of mine over the years, not listening to what other people were telling me. Oh, but I don't wanna take the spotlight off where it belongs... on mom and mad. Um... I think I remember... reading once... "Hear, my son... your father's instructions... and forsake not... your mother's teaching." [instrumental music] Back then, I didn't listen, uh, too well to much of anything, other than my own perceived intelligence and... upperclassmen, or my instructors, whose approval I was craving at the time. [clears throat] Um... I am glad that my own son... Tim... and his wife Elizabeth are able to be here today. I guess it's about time that they met you all... and you all met them, uh, especially since Tim has just taken a new job at Fort Mill. And, son, I'm... glad... that you're gonna finally get a chance to meet your grandmother and grandfather and get to... know them. [voice breaking] I should have... years ago. [sniffles] [music continues] [sobbing] [indistinct chatter] Night, guys. Mom, what are you doing? I have someone coming on Monday to do this. -It's your anniversary. -Well... I'm just rinsing a few dishes. You know me, I can't leave a dirty kitchen. [Josh sighs] Okay, I know I'm not gonna win an argument with you. Mm-hmm. -Are you okay? -Mm-hmm. Ronnie's gonna stay at the house. This is a good thing? Yeah, it's good. It's really good. Okay. Well, listen, if you're gonna do dishes, then, uh, you need to do 'em right. -Oh. -[laughing] We're about to head home. I just wanted to say goodbye, and how thankful we both are to finally get to meet you and grandpa. Well, you just don't know. Oh. You two have no idea how thrilled your grandma and I are that you're gonna be moving just right down the road in Fort Mill. We're gonna have to have you over. -Mm-hmm. -Better yet... We need to give you two a night off and get to know your kids better. -Yes. -Wow. That's very kind of you. Thank you. Truth is, I have so many questions I'd love to ask you. Sometimes I just don't know what to do with the little ones. Oh, honey, I understand. When Ronnie was born, I was so scared. I didn't have a clue what I was doing. -Bye-bye. Say "bye." -[baby babbling] Bye-bye. Bye-bye. [instrumental music] So they took the baby Jesus and they wrapped him in swaddling clothes and they laid him in a manger. [laughs] What are you doing? Tell them the story. [chuckles] Now, there were shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flocks by night. And suddenly, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them, and they were so afraid. The angel said unto them, "Fear not, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy."
