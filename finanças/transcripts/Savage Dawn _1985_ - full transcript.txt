Fill her up. Yes, sir. How far is Agua Dulce? - It's right down the road a piece. You going to the contest? Looking for a friend. Tequila. Tequila. Hey hey, mamacita. - How about a little service, eh? We all need a ride like crazy, what do you say? - Mamacita, that's not very nice. Mamacita, that's not very nice. Hey, relax, Pancho, we were just being friendly. What about the bottle? What bottle? That bottle. - Are you brain damaged, you taco vendor? You and your putrid refried bean breath, did you see what you did? - That was Spyder's personal bottle. He brought it in with him, I say you owe us for it. I saw him pick it up. Are you calling me a liar? Look out. - We was just having a conversation, and you interrupted us. Yeah, that ain't very polite. Ain't polite at all. - Don't touch me, unless you love me. Hey, go! Don't move. Dag nabbit. - Saying sorry makes a man feel better. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Not to me, to them. Come on. I'm sorry. Hi, Fran. How are you? I'm fine. Hi, how are you? Fine. Hey, Willard. Hi Mr. Joe Bob. You know Willard, you're supposed to have adoption papers to have one of them kids. No, no, Andy's my friend. Willard takes real good care of Andy. Nothing bad ever happens to Andy. Well, no papers, I'm gonna have to throw you in the slammer. Again? Yeah, you can clean out them slop buckets real good. - And we'll just sort of forget about them papers. Where can I find Tick Rand? - Well, looky what we got here, boys. I mean, this must be one of them psycho cycles that we see in the moving pictures. You come here to tear up our town, boy? Or maybe get lucky with one of our women, eh? - Yeah, maybe get lucky with one of our- Katie. Stryker. I don't believe it. The last time I saw you, you were like like a- - A little kid. Kids grow up. I can see that. Oh, you're smokin'. Yeah, I can see that. Uh, guys, this is Ben Stryker. A dear friend of my father's. - Well any friend of yours, Miss Rand, is a friend of mine. We're having us a little celebration this afternoon at the Tom Cat Bar. I'd really like you to come there. Maybe. - I'm really looking forward to it. I mean, I'd really like you to be there. - Hey, there's a big, juicy steak waiting for you at home. Looks like a real nice home. Yeah, I guess it does. It's still missing one or two things, though. Stryker, are you coming home? Where's Tick? - Him and Danny are up at the gold mine. So, why don't you run up on there while I put on some lunch? Hi, Danny. How you doing? You remember me? Sure, and Dad talks about you. Sometimes. I've never seen a bike like that. The Dutchess? - Yeah, I mean, I've got magazines and stuff, but, uh... I'll give you a ride later. Is Tick inside? Yeah. Come on, he's been waiting for you. Are you still at it, Tick? - Oh, Stryker, you old son of a bitch. You don't write, we get one lousy phone call. Where you been, Beirut? El Salvador? - No, it's all behind me now, Tick. Yeah, me too. Danny, take Stryker's jacket so he feels more at home. - Sure, let me take that for you, Mr. Stryker. Just Stryker. Okay, Stryker. - Go on down the hill and help your sister with lunch. - But, Dad, I was just gonna hang around. - I'll give you a ride later, alright? Right. Okay, how long you staying? Can I let you know? - Well, hell, you can stay here just as long as you want to, you know that. Nah, I'll stay in town. So, it looks like you really dug in here, Tick. - Well, it's a little different than designing weapons for the company. You were the best there was. And the best there is. That's live. - You remember Mugamba's headquarters when we blew that guy up? Tin cans and nails stuffed in pig dung. - We hit that mother with the Tick Rand special. The ol' shit bomb. That was a time. - Yeah, so what are you doing here? - Well, my pension from the government is enough to make ends meet. This is what really keeps me going. Gold? I didn't know you were interested in this. Well, I'm not, really, the spring that fed this town dried up about five years ago, and you can't get to the gold without water, so the mine closed up about two months later. For the last several years this town has been dying a slow and miserable death. And you care? And I care. - What are we looking for, absolution? - I don't know exactly what I'm looking for. Whatever you want to call it, meaning, the reason for living, I don't know. I do know that you and I brought flaming hell to a lot of towns over the years. Just once I'd like to bring a town some hope. What are you looking forward to, Stryker? - That nice, juicy steak that Kate's gonna cook for me. You know, Mr. Packer, at this rate we're not gonna get to Vegas 'til it's real late. I mean, are we gonna see the good shows or what? - I'm doing the best I can, Becky Sue, the very best I can. We'll get there in plenty of time, the convention doesn't start until noon tomorrow- Screw your convention. You know Floyd, this is really a dumb-ass idea. I mean, if your wife didn't suspect from the beginning- Suspect? Suspect what? This is a business trip, Becky Sue. You're my secretary. Secretary? Floyd, the woman is not a complete moron. I type one word per minute, and then it's usually misspelled. Oh my God, oh my God. Down, down, down. Back, back, back. Now, I'm sure you've observed the southern migration of the sperm whale because I think I see one of their species looming on the horizon, and I think he's just about ready to blow, and so are you. She's all yours, Meatrack. Floyd. Well, that's nice. Real nice. - Hey, pal, you better save her for Pigiron, you jerk. Zero. Floyd, do something. Shut up, Becky Sue. Yeah, Floyd. Do something. - Oh, Floyd would like to help you out, but he's in a little pinch right now. - Well, you look like a man with a problem, Floyd. Well, then again, I guess a man's got to know his limitations. Hey. So why are we stopping? Wait, hold on. - Come on, man. - Stay here. Floyd, if you'll permit me, maybe I can help you solve your problems. Floyd, if you'll pay attention, watch, I'll give you a little instruction. The most important thing is to be subtle. No, stop, no. Floyd, help. Don't maul her too bad, save a little for Pigiron. He ain't even here. Stop, no. Please stop. No, stop. Stop, Floyd, stop. So what are you gonna do? Nothing. - Oh, come on, what about that girl? Hey, you can't leave her. - There's 25 of them and one of me. Well what about me? You do it. Funny. - Knock his head off the wall, kill him. Get him, get him. Knock his head off, kill him. Winner by a knockout in the first round, deputy Joe Bob. Rachel, what would you say to a little fuck? I'd say, hello, little fuck. To the company. - And all the stinking little wars that you and I are not stuck in anymore, Tick. Amen. Hi, Tick. How's it hanging? Rachel. Rachel, this is Ben Stryker. Real good buddy of mine. - Well, welcome to the Tom Cat Bar, Mr. Stryker. This place is kind of a local legend, you know. - Tonight the legend comes alive. - Every tom cat in the county comes down here to prove he's the toughest son'bitch around. I'm looking forward to seeing you in there tonight. I ain't enough to prove. Hey, Kate. Well, I'm sorry I'm late. You are? I thought you was just plain sorry. See you later, sugar. - Deep down she's a real sweet girl. Way deep down. Hey Danny, how you doing? Hey Dad. What brings you into town? - I took Katie for a ride on my bike. Yeah, it was wonderful. Beer. - Oh, we're real democratic here Mr. Stryker. Well, just about anybody can climb into that ring and see what kind of a man he is. Don't need no experience. No entry fee, just a little guts. - And I'm gonna save the next dance for you. I don't dance. - Why, they're playing our song, sweetie. Like I said, I don't dance. Danny. What are you doing here? - Well, I came to check out the scene. - Are you going to enter the contest? " Me? Nah, I think I'll wait 'til next year. It's kind of hot in there so I thought I'd watch the action from out here. Oh. Want to watch? - My parents are waiting up for me. Ah. Uh, I was thinking you might want to go for a ride on my bike? I'd like that. How about tomorrow? I'll be out in front of the church at seven. Alright. Okey. Alright. Which one of you cowboys is gonna get on out there and go for the gold? Nah, don't you want to feel your muscles snap? You want to slap somebody's body down and completely overwhelm them, huh? You know that you do. - I hope you don't mind us crashing your little soiree. Hey, what do you say? All day,, all day, - Kemosabe, what's up? Hey, listen up, listen, quiet down now. I want to tell you something. I've got here $500, count 'em. For anybody who wants to stay in the ring with a certain dude in this room. Deputy Joe Bob McEwan. $500 for stomping on a deputy. Shit, lady, my boys here got cause just for the fuck of it. And of coarse to please a pretty woman like you, if you know what I mean. You want to kiss me, deputy, is that it? - Well, looky what we get us here. - We oughta learn that boy some manners. - You boys don't want to fuck with him. Pigiron, that's a piss hander. - Look, I just got finished telling you, you boys do not want to fuck with him. You know what I mean? Y'all came here to party, right? My buddy Zero over here, he be mighty pleased to stomp on that deputy you got over there, what's his name, Smooch Bob, or something? He likes doin shit like that. - I do like doing shit like that. Hell, I could stomp him real good. Til their face gets all red and squishy. And they always start to cry and beg for me to stop, but I don't stop. And you know why, my man? Because that is the best part. - Katie, let's go on home, I'm tired. - Come on shitkicker, I want your ass. Do it Joe Bob! Get over here, come on. Come on, Zero. The rules are real simple.

What made you come back? - Well, you know sheriff, I got to tell you, I took a real liking to your town, you know. I thought maybe I'd come back here and party a bit. I mean, I've seen all your women giving me the eye something fierce, and I just thought, maybe I'd come back and service them all, you know what I mean? Let them get a real man for a change. Move, asshole. Before I squeeze this trigger and pretty up your face. - Hey Zero, looks like we're gonna be hanging out in there for a while, babe.

They're real simple, I don't want nobody leaving it, and nobody inviting any god damned outside guests, you know what I mean? So let's party! Let's fucking party. - Don't be frightened, my holy child. You see, you're in the house of the Lord. Oh, I'm not frightened. Not of you. You seek comfort, my child. You see, God sent you to me, to comfort me in my war against sin. You know that power? It's the power that made you stray from the path of righteousness. To wallow in lust and sin. I have sinned. Well, contact with a sacred vessel will purify you. - Now you understand, I want a trim on my beard. I don't want you to mess with my hair, I just want a trim on the beard. Alright. What's your name? I'm the Big Zero. The Big Zero? Well, Mr. Zero, I'm a born again Christian. People come into my shop, I like to tell them about Jesus and how that he can change their lives, and make them happy. I know you boys caused a lot of trouble around town, and you know, if you just give your heart to Jesus, you know- - Let's get one thing straightened, man. You don't want to fuck with me. You understand? I won't upset you. If anything, I want to put more love in your life, because God loves everybody, and you're no different. And I know you got a heart, I don't care what you've been through, no matter how much pain, he can heal it, because he's the healer. The word says that he's closer than a friend- - You're getting right on the edge. Just a little off the side. No, no, no, no, no, come here my child. You weren't that good. I said, come here. I just did the preacher. - No, no, no, you don't understand, you see, I was ministering to this child. - He ministered the hell out of me. - No, no, no, you don't understand. You don't understand. - You done real good there, Billy. We'll call you, alright? It weren't no big thing. Relax, preacher man. Eh, you in hell, boy. It's a natural thing. Ain't nobody got to know about this. Now, I know that you're a respected man in the community. I wouldn't want to go messing that up for anybody. - Course not, wouldn't want to mess that up at all. - Why don't you shut the fuck up, man? Oh, God, no. Jesus. I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what, man. I promise you, alright, I won't tell no one. Thank you. Of course, you know, you're gonna have to pay the piper. You know what, I'll have you do a little thing for me, alright? Know what I mean, hm? Know what I mean, hm? Yes. ♪ Amazing grace ♪ How sweet the sound ♪ That saved a wretch- That's it. That's it.

Just like we got that cripple. We'll be back. Your nightmare's just begun- No, no!
