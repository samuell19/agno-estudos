♪♪♪♪ ( Spooky Music ) HEY, WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT ABOUT THIS HOUSE? FORGET THAT HOUSE. SOMEBODY'S COMING. COME ON, SOPHIE. YOU KNOW NOBODY EVER COMES HERE ON HALLOWEEN. BUT, MOM, IT'S JUST A COSTUME PARTY. YOU'VE GOTTA LET ME GO! THE WHOLE WORLD IS GOING! IF I DON'T GO, I'LL BE A FREAK! THE ODDS ARE 50% I'D GET ONE NORMAL SISTER. MOM, I'M 13. I'M PRACTICALLY A GROWNUP. I'M CERTAINLY OLD ENOUGH TO MAKE MY OWN CHOICES. RIGHT? YEAH. I GUESS SO. IS THERE AN AGE FOR THAT? MARNIE, I'M SORRY, BUT YOU ARE NOT GOING OUT ON HALLOWEEN. WHY? I HAVE MY REASONS, AND I WILL EXPLAIN THEM TO YOU WHEN YOU ARE TALLER. MOM, YOU HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT FOR MY WHOLE LIFE, OK? IT'S JUST ONE NIGHT. WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL? IT DOES SEEM A LITTLE UNFAIR. I MEAN, SEEING AS HOW MARNIE LIKES WEIRD STUFF SO MUCH. YEAH. HALLOWEEN IS, LIKE, MADE FOR HER. SKELETONS, WITCHES, VAMPIRES... YOU KNOW, SHE SPENDS OUR WHOLE MATH CLASS DRAWING GHOSTS IN HER NOTEBOOK. GUYS! ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ALL. THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING. YOU'VE BEEN A LOVELY AUDIENCE BUT THE SHOW IS OVER. MARNIE WILL SEE YOU ALL TOMORROW. MOM! SEE YOU LATER, MARNIE. WE'LL BRING YOU SOME CANDY. GOOD NIGHT. I'M SO SICK OF THIS! I WANT TO KNOW WHY WE CAN'T BE LIKE OTHER KIDS AND GO OUT ON HALLOWEEN? MY POOR LITTLE SISTER SHOULD BE OUT TRICK-OR-TREATING. BUT LOOK AT HER. YOU'VE KEPT HER FROM A NORMAL CHILDHOOD, AND IT'S TURNED HER INTO A WALL ORNAMENT. I THINK IT'S OBVIOUS WHY HALLOWEEN IS BAD. THAT WHOLE RAZOR BLADE IN THE APPLE THING WAS AN URBAN MYTH, OF COURSE, BUT ALL THAT CANDY CAUSES CAVITIES AND GUM DISEASE. AND THOSE MASK EVERYBODY WEARS HAVE THESE WEIRD KIND OF TOXIC FUMES INSIDE THAT MAKE YOUR ARMS GO LIMP AND... AND... IT'S TOTALLY TOO LATE FOR HIM. I'M SORRY. I KNOW THAT YOU WANT TO GO OUT WITH YOUR FRIENDS, BUT THERE ARE JUST SOME THINGS ABOUT HALLOWEEN THAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. LIKE THERE'S SOME BIG, MYSTERIOUS REASON WHY WE CAN'T GO OUT. FACE IT, MOM. YOU DON'T TRUST YOUR OWN KIDS. THAT IS NOT TRUE. OH, YES, IT IS. YOU KEEP US ALL IN THIS BIG BUBBLE. HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO GROW UP IF WE CAN'T EXPLORE THE WORLD, TRY NEW STUFF, AND TAKE SOME RISKS? MARNIE, I AM JUST TRYING TO PROTECT YOU. YEAH. YOU'RE PROTECTING US FROM BEING ANYTHING BUT A BUNCH OF VEGETABLES. HEY, LOOK. I'M A POTATO. ARE YOU HAPPY NOW? MAYBE I'LL PUT DOWN SOME ROOTS IN THE CARPET? "OH, NO, MARNIE. IT'S TOO DANGEROUS. THERE'S THINGS ABOUT VEGETABLES THAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND." SOMEBODY'S COMING. COME, MY LITTLE WALL ORNAMENT. LET'S GET YOU WASHED UP FOR DINNER. COME ON. WHY ARE YOU SO OBSESSED WITH HALLOWEEN? IT'S JUST LIKE MOM SAYS. IT GIVES LITTLE KIDS DUMB IDEAS ABOUT THERE BEING MAGIC. LIKE THAT HELPS THEM PREPARE FOR LIFE. PERSONALLY, GIVE ME A GOOD NATURE DOCUMENTARY ANY DAY. HALLOWEEN IS COOL, NATURE BOY. IT'S EXCITING, STRANGE, AND ANCIENT. PLUS, MOM AND DAD MET ON HALLOWEEN. SHHH. WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO? YOU KNOW HOW TALKING ABOUT DAD ALWAYS BUMS MOM OUT. WHY CAN'T YOU PICK SOME OTHER HOLIDAY TO GET HUNG UP ON, LIKE ARBOR DAY? TREES ARE IMPORTANT TOO, YOU KNOW. HEY, GUYS. WAIT UP! WAIT FOR ME. OH, C'MON. COME ON. SUIT YOURSELF. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. C'MON, MOM. IT'S JUST ONE COOKIE. NOT BEFORE DINNER, SOPHIE. MARNIE'S RIGHT. YOU NEVER LET US DO ANYTHING FUN. YOU CAN HAVE A COOKIE AFTER DINNER. I WANT THAT COOKIE. I REALLY WANT THAT COOKIE. NOT AGAIN! ARE YOU EATING A COOKIE? NO. GO SIT DOWN. GOOD THING SHE DOESN'T LIKE LIVER, EH, DEAR? MOTHER! GRANDMA! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? GRANDMA! GRANDMA! HOW WONDERFUL TO SEE YOU AND THE CHILDREN AGAIN. OH, MY, MY! HOW YOU'VE GROWN! DID YOU BRING US PRESENTS? OH, PRESENTS, PRESENTS, PRESENTS. WHAT KIND OF A GRANDMA DO YOU THINK I'D BE IF I DIDN'T BRING YOU PRESENTS? THEY'RE RIGHT HERE IN MY SUITCASE. I JUST-- I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT THING WENT. JUST A MINUTE. COME ON, LITTLE DARLING. COME ON. HERE IT IS. HOW COME YOU BEEN GONE SO LONG, GRANDMA? WELL, YOU KNOW, ONE THING AND ANOTHER. BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT I'M HERE NOW. AND I'M SO GLAD TO SEE YOU. OH. C'MON, C'MON. HEY, MOM, DO YOU THINK YOU AND GRANDMA COULD, LIKE, NOT FIGHT FOR ONCE? I MEAN, WE HAVEN'T SEEN HER IN OVER A YEAR. GRANDMA AGGIE'S THE ONE WHO ALWAYS STARTS IT. DOES NOT. DOES TOO. DOES NOT. DOES TOO. DOES NOT! EUREKA! CANDY! THAT'S THE SPIRIT. OH, WOW. LET'S PUT ON OUR BIKINIS AND GO SWIMMING IN IT. AND THEN WE'LL PUT UP THE DECORATIONS, SO WE CAN GET THIS PARTY STARTED. LOOK. GRANDMA DRESSED UP FOR HALLOWEEN. WHAT? OH, YES. OF COURSE I DID. I ALWAYS DO. OH, HERE, HONEY. I WANT YOU TO GO HANG THIS ON THE DOOR. IT ANNOYS THE VAMPIRES. THIS BAG DEFIES LOGIC. HOW DOES ALL THIS STUFF FIT IN HERE? YOU KNOW, DEAR, IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, THIS IS MARNIE'S 13th HALLOWEEN. WONDERFULLY LUCKY NUMBER 13. TOTALLY. YES. I'M WELL AWARE OF WHAT NUMBER IT IS, MOTHER. HEY, LOOK. A PENTAGRAM. LON CHANEY HAD ONE OF THESE ON HIS PALM WHEN HE GOT BITTEN BY THAT WEREWOLF. SO HE DID. I'VE ALWAYS SAID THE MOVIES CAN TEACH US ABOUT LIFE. MOTHER, AS I JUST GOT THROUGH TELLING MARNIE, HALLOWEEN IS NOT SOMETHING-- WHAT ELSE CAN I DO, GRANDMA? WHY DON'T YOU PUT OUT THE PUMPKINS? SEE, THEY HAVE SUCH CUTE LITTLE FACES. JUST LIKE YOURS. NEAT. AND I THOUGHT YOU'D APPRECIATE THESE. HIEROGLYPHICS! MOTHER? THESE LOOK LIKE THE ONES FROM THE EGYPTIAN BOOK OF THE DEAD. VERY GOOD. I BET YOU GET "A"s IN SCHOOL. ACTUALLY, SHE GETS "B"s AND "C"s. I GET THE "A"s. OOH. GRANDMA, THIS IS TOTALLY AWESOME. NOBODY AROUND HERE REALLY APPRECIATES MY TASTE IN WEIRD STUFF. ENCOURAGEMENT NOT GOOD. NO. AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE? I HAVE DEJA VU A LOT. I MEAN LIKE ALL THE TIME. REALLY? WELL, YOU KNOW-- MOTHER... COULD I TALK TO YOU IN THE KITCHEN FOR JUST ONE MINUTE? ABSOLUTELY, DEAR. AS SOON AS I GET THE CHILDREN INTO THEIR COSTUMES. COSTUMES?! WOW! AND THE GHOST. THERE. WHAT? OH, THIS IS A WINNER. THIS IS SO AWESOME! I'M A WICCAN. I'M A GHOST. I THINK I'M A BIG PIMPLE. ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT! THESE CHILDREN ARE NOT GOING OUT TRICK-OR-TREATING. AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR DINNER. BUT, MOM-- NO, NO. SHE'S RIGHT. WE'LL EAT THE CANDY LATER. WOO WOO WOO OOO WOO WOO. OH, NO, DEAR. IT'S MORE LIKE A MOANING SOUND. YOU KNOW, GHOSTS TEND TO BE VERY DEPRESSED CREATURES, ANYWAY. LIKE THIS... WOOOOOO... WOOOOOOO... WELL, MOTHER, YOUR VISIT'S BEEN VERY EDUCATIONAL, BUT IT'S TIME FOR BED. AW, MOM. SHE'S RIGHT. YOUR MOTHER AND I NEED TO TALK ABOUT GROWNUP THINGS. CAN'T YOU AT LEAST TELL US A BEDTIME STORY? YEAH. GREAT IDEA. YEAH. I MEAN HORRIBLE IDEA. C'MON, MOM. PLEASE. PLEASE, PLEASE. WELL... ALL RIGHT. BUT JUST ONE. SEE YOU UPSTAIRS, GRANDMA. YOU GUYS GET READY FOR BED AND WE'LL BE RIGHT UP. OH, I MISS THEM SO. YOU KNOW, DEAR, I'VE BEEN THINKING. I'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU MOVE BACK HOME, GWEN. THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM FOR ALL OF YOU AT MY HOUSE. MOTHER-- AND SINCE WILLIAM'S PASSED ON, THERE'S NOTHING TO HOLD YOU HERE. NOTHING HAS TO HOLD ME HERE, MOTHER. I LIKE BEING HERE. I CAN HAVE A NORMAL LIFE HERE. THEY CAN HAVE A NORMAL LIFE HERE. OH, BEING NORMAL IS VASTLY OVERRATED. WELL, I LIKE BEING NORMAL. AS MUCH AS I WANT THE KIDS TO KNOW THEIR FAMILY, THE FACT IS, YOU'RE NOT NORMAL. HMM. EVERY TIME YOU COME INTO THE HOUSE, IT'S CHAOS. AND THE CANDY AND THE DECORATIONS AND THE... MOTHER... LET'S NOT FIGHT AGAIN. I KNOW YOU'RE ONLY HERE FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS. GO AND TELL 'EM A STORY. TALK TO THEM AND GET TO KNOW THEM. BUT DON'T TELL THEM ABOUT HOME. YOUR HOME, I MEAN. OH, DON'T WORRY, DEAR. I WON'T TELL THEM A THING. THANK YOU. HI. I JUST CAME BY TO CHECK THAT EVERYONE'S GOT THEIR THERMOSTAT SET TO 68 DEGREES, BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONSERVE ENERGY DURING THE EVENING... DYLAN, JUST GET IN HERE. WHICH STORY ARE YOU GOING TO TELL US? IS IT ONE I KNOW? OH, NO, I WOULDN'T THINK SO. MY STORY'S ABOUT A MAGICAL PLACE, WHERE MANY DIFFERENT SORTS OF CREATURES LIVE TOGETHER IN PEACE. LIKE CLEVELAND? I HEAR THEY HAVE A NICE SCHOOL DISTRICT. WELL, ACTUALLY, THE PLACE I'M SPEAKING OF IS CALLED HALLOWEENTOWN. AND THE RESIDENTS ARE A BIT MORE... EXOTIC. MONSTERS, GOBLINS, GHOSTS, AND VAMPIRES AND GNOMES AND SKELETONS. DO THEY HAVE BANSHEES THERE TOO? BY THE DOZENS. AND, OF COURSE, A FEW VERY FINE WITCHES. I DON'T LIKE WITCHES. THEY'RE MEAN AND SCARY. OH, NO, NO, NO, SWEETHEART. SOME OF THEM ARE JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. SOME ARE KIND. SOME ARE MEAN. THAT'S THE WAY THEY USE THEIR MAGIC. YOU CAN'T TELL WHAT'S IN A MONSTER'S HEART JUST BY LOOKING AT THEM. SOMETIMES, SOME OF THE SLIMIEST, UGLIEST LITTLE MONSTERS TURN OUT TO BE THE NICEST. I WANT TO GO THERE. EXCUSE ME, BUT WE HAVE AN IMPRESSIONABLE YOUNG CHILD HERE. I THINK WE SHOULD MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THIS PLACE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS JUST PRETEND. OH, YES, YES. WELL, ACTUALLY, I HAVE TO CONFESS I DIDN'T MAKE IT UP. I READ ABOUT IT IN A BOOK. SO, YOU SEE, MAYBE IT IS REAL. A BOOK? WHAT BOOK? THERE. HALLOWEENTOWN. LET ME SEE. ALL RIGHT. LOOK. A GHOST. JUST LIKE WE WERE PLAYING, GRANDMA. OH, THERE'S A WEREWOLF AND A VAMPIRE AND A GNOME. DOGMAN. THIS BOOK IS SO NEAT. IT HAS LIKE ALL THE STUFF I'M INTERESTED IN. GREAT. THE WEIRDO ENCYCLOPEDIA. EEEW. SNOTMAN. LOOK. IT'S MARNIE. IT IS ME. SHE DOESN'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE YOU. SHE'S WAY TOO CUTE. OH, YEAH. AND THIS IS FROM A GUY WHO COULD WIN AN UGLY CONTEST. THERE IS QUITE A RESEMBLANCE. PERHAPS MARNIE HAS A SECRET LIFE WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT. WELL, IF SHE IS A WITCH, SHE'S GOT THE WEIRD PART DOWN PAT. IT'S JUST THE MAGIC POWER SHE'S MISSING. HOW ABOUT IT, DEAR? HAVE YOU CASTED ANY SPELLS OR TAKEN MIDNIGHT FLIGHTS THROUGH THE SKY? I WISH. BUT THE TRUTH IS THERE'S NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT ME. OH, NO, DEAR. YOU'RE VERY SPECIAL. YOU'RE A CROMWELL. AND SINCE THE DAWN OF TIME, THE CROMWELLS HAVE BEEN THE MOST-- MOTHER. IT'S GETTING LATE. YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO MISS YOUR BUS BACK HOME. OH, GRANDMA HAS TO GO? CAN'T YOU STAY OVERNIGHT, GRANDMA? YOUR MOTHER'S QUITE RIGHT. IF I DON'T HEAD HOME BY MIDNIGHT, IT'S A LONG TIME UNTIL THE NEXT BUS. KISS GRANDMA GOODNIGHT. GOODNIGHT, DEAR. DON'T LET THE BOOGEYMAN BITE. I'LL BE BACK TO SEE YOU ALL AS SOON AS I CAN. THAT'S LIGHTS OUT, YOU TWO. MOTHER, I'M GONNA PUT DYLAN TO BED, AND THEN I WILL MEET YOU DOWN IN THE KITCHEN IN ONE MINUTE. OF COURSE, DEAR. GOODNIGHT, GRANDMA. BYE. AND AFTER I TOLD YOU NOT TO TELL THEM ANYTHING ABOUT IT. I WAS ONLY TRYING TO DO WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE LONG AGO. YOU'RE ON THE VERGE OF BREAKING A TRADITION THAT GOES BACK MORE THAN A THOUSAND YEARS. YOUR TRADITION, MOTHER, NOT MINE. MARNIE IS MY DAUGHTER, AND IF I DECIDE NOT TO TRAIN HER LIKE A WITCH, THEN IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. A WITCH'S 13th HALLOWEEN IS SUPPOSED TO MARK THE COMPLETION OF HER TRAINING. If Marni's training doesn't begin tonight her powers will be lost forever. Yes, and she'll finally be human. She'll finally be normal like her brother, like her father, AND LIKE SOPHIE WILL BE AFTER HER. WEDDING A HUMAN FATHER! You're lucky that you have two children THAT ARE SHOWING POWERS AT ALL. DO YOU REALLY WANT THEM GOING THROUGH LIFE DOING THINGS THE HARD WAY? I MEAN, LOOK AT YOU WITH YOUR PLASTIC BOWLS, WHEN YOU KNOW LEFTOVER CHICKEN KEEPS BETTER WHEN IT'S BACK ON THE BONE. MOTHER! GET THAT THING OUT OF HERE RIGHT NOW! ( Clucking ) FOR YEARS, YOU HAVE BEEN COMING HERE. YOU HAVE BEEN DROPPING HINTS TO MARNIE, AND YOU'VE BEEN BADGERING ME TO START HER TRAINING. I KNOW THAT'S WHY YOU CAME HERE TONIGHT, MOTHER. BUT THE FIGHT IS OVER. DO YOU KNOW THAT? THE CLOCK HAS FINALLY RUN OUT, AND YOU CAN JUST GO HOME. GWEN, AS MUCH AS I THINK YOU'RE MAKING A TERRIBLE MISTAKE WITH MARNIE, YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT WHY I CAME HERE TONIGHT. FACT IS, I CAME TO ASK FOR YOUR HELP. MY HELP? WITH WHAT? WELL, SOMETHING IS WRONG AT HOME. SOMETHING'S HAPPENING. EVERY DAY, I FIND ANOTHER NEIGHBOR HAS CHANGED. TURNED HATEFUL. IT'S FRIGHTENING. AND SOON AFTER THAT, THEY DISAPPEAR ALTOGETHER. MY NEIGHBORS DISAPPEAR SOMETIMES TOO. IT'S CALLED MOVING. I'M QUITE SERIOUS ABOUT THIS. IT'S AS THOUGH SOMETHING OR SOMEONE IS TRYING TO RETURN US TO THE DARK TIMES. AND I FEAR MY POWERS ALONE MAY NOT BE ENOUGH TO STOP IT. I NEED ANOTHER CROMWELL WITCH! I NEED YOU! MOTHER, THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER WITCHES AND WARLOCKS IN HALLOWEENTOWN. WHY DON'T YOU RECRUIT ONE OF THEM? OH, I'VE TRIED! YOU KNOW HOW IT IS TODAY-- NO ONE WANTS TO GET INVOLVED. MOTHER, I'M SURE THAT YOU BELIEVE THAT THERE'S SOME KIND OF PROBLEM, BUT I CAN'T JUST LEAVE MY KIDS TO GO FIGHT SOME NAMELESS FORCE IN ANOTHER WORLD THAT I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH. NOTHING TO DO WITH? WELL, FINE. BURY YOUR HEAD IN THE SAND OF THAT PRECIOUS MORTAL WORLD OF YOURS. PERHAPS THE CROMWELL LINE WILL END WITH YOU. BUT LET'S JUST HOPE THAT HALLOWEENTOWN DOESN'T COME TO AN END ALONG WITH IT. ENJOY YOUR LEFTOVERS, DEAR. ( Clucks ) MOTHER. AND THEN SHE TALKED ABOUT ALL THIS WEIRD STUFF THAT'S HAPPENING IN HALLOWEENTOWN, LIKE IT'S A REAL PLACE. THEN SHE TURNED OUR LEFTOVERS INTO A LIVE CHICKEN STANDING RIGHT THERE IN THE BOWL. AND THAT'S WHEN I KNEW SHE IS A WITCH, AND SO IS MOM, AND SO AM I. BECAUSE THEY BOTH SAID SO. WHAT DO YOU THINK? I THINK IT PROVES INSANITY IS HEREDITARY. I JUST HOPE BOYS ARE IMMUNE. IT MUST BE ONE OF THOSE RADIO-CONTROLLED MODELS. SHE'S LEAVING. SHE'S GOING BACK TO HALLOWEENTOWN. I GOTTA GO AFTER HER. GO AFTER HER? ARE YOU CRAZY? I HAVE TO GO. IF SHE DOESN'T START TRAINING ME AS A WITCH TONIGHT, I COULD LOSE MY POWERS FOREVER. YOU DON'T REALLY BELIEVE ALL THIS WITCH STUFF IS TRUE, DO YOU? DYLAN, HAVEN'T YOU EVER WONDERED ABOUT THE STUFF THAT GOES ON IN OUR HOUSE? NO. LIKE WHY MOM WON'T LET US TALK ABOUT, WATCH, OR READ ANYTHING THAT HAS THE WORD MAGIC IN IT. NO. HAVEN'T YOU EVER WONDERED WHY WE PRETEND HALLOWEEN DOESN'T EXIST? OR WHY I HAVE DEJA VU ALL THE TIME? OR WHY STUFF SEEMS TO FALL OFF THE SHELVES WHENEVER SOPHIE HAS A TANTRUM? NO. WELL, I HAVE. AND NOW THAT I'VE FOUND OUT THE TRUTH, I'M NOT GOING TO STAY HERE AND TURN INTO A BORING HUMAN LIKE YOU. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, BORING LIKE ME? TV: TIRED OF THAT DANK, MUSTY ODOR IN YOUR CELLAR? TRY THE NEW SPORE BUSTER DELUXE. IT REMOVES MOLD AND FUNGUS JUST LIKE MAGIC. NO, IT DOESN'T. THE HOUSE DOESN'T SMELL LIKE MUSHROOM OLIVES ANYMORE. THANKS, SPORE BUSTER. MARNIE, WAIT UP. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I'M THE MAN OF THE HOUSE. I GOTTA KEEP AN EYE ON YOU. PLUS, I'M GONNA HAVE A HARD TIME GETTING BACK TO SLEEP TILL I FIND OUT IF YOU'RE CRAZY OR NOT. THEN HELP ME FIND HER. SHE'S GOTTA BE AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE. THERE SHE IS. GET DOWN. WHERE DID THAT BUS STOP COME FROM? I DON'T KNOW. CAN I PUT MY SHOE ON NOW? I'M HAVING THAT DEJA VU FEELING AGAIN. YOU KNEW I WAS GONNA PUT ON MY SHOE? NO. ABOUT THIS WHOLE THING-- THE BUS STOP, GRANDMA. WAIT. MAYBE IT'S NOT DEJA VU AT ALL. MAYBE I'M SEEING THE FUTURE. RIGHT. NOW YOU CAN SEE THE FUTURE. TELL ME. WHAT AM I GONNA HAVE FOR BREAKFAST? WHY ARE YOU SUCH A DOWNER? WHY ARE YOU SUCH A NUT CASE? DOWNER. NUT CASE. DOW-- WHERE'D THAT BUS COME FROM? I DON'T KNOW BUT I'M NOT MISSING IT. HI, SKINNER. HELLO, AGGIE. MADE IT. WHY DON'T WE GO SIT WITH GRANDMA? NOT YET. I DON'T WANT TO TAKE A CHANCE OF HER STOPPING THE BUS TO SEND US HOME. STOPPING THE BUS WHERE? SO, ANYWAY, THERE I WAS TRYING TO SPOOK THIS FELLOW-- HE WAS BUYING NACHOS AT THE MINI-MART-- WHEN THIS SMART-ALECK CHILD WITH A DREADFUL LITTLE MONSTER MASK RUNS UP TO ME AND YELLS "DADDY!" I ASK YOU, WHERE IS THE RESPECT? IT'S NOT LIKE THE OLD DAYS. PEOPLE HAVE CHANGED. I WAS A DEMON FROM THE UNDERWORLD, AND THEY SAY, "BIG DEAL. I SAW THE SAME THING ON JERRY SPRINGER." MUST BE ONE OF THOSE CHARTER BUSES COMING BACK FROM A COSTUME PARTY AT THE MOOSE LODGE. OR MAYBE-- OOOH! WE'RE HERE. YEAH, BUT WHERE'S HERE? OOH! I'M SORRY. SORRY. AGGIE! HOW ARE YOU, DEAR? OH, HARRIET, I'M FINE. BEEN VISITING WITH THE MORTALS, EH? DIDN'T HAVE TIME THIS YEAR MYSELF. DOING SOME VOLUNTEER WORK DOWN AT THE HEADLESS SHELTER. POOR DEARS. CARE FOR A MUFFIN? I BAKED 'EM FOR THE FOLKS AT THE SHELTER. DIDN'T OCCUR TO ME THEY COULDN'T EAT THEM. NO HEADS. HA HA HA HA! OH, WELL. MUST BE OFF. TAKE CARE. BYE, HARRIET. OH, WOW. WHOA! I DON'T GET IT. MONSTERS ARE JUST PRETEND. DYLAN, THIS IS IT. MOM SAID THEY WERE JUST PRETEND. THIS IS HALLOWEENTOWN, JUST LIKE THE BOOK. OR MAYBE WE FELL ASLEEP ON THE BUS. YEAH, THAT'S IT. IT'S ALL A DREAM. THE DECORATIONS, THE GOBLINS, THE WITCHES, THE GHOSTS? AND GRANDMA. SHE WAS A DREAM TOO. OH, NO! GRANDMA! WHERE DID SHE GO? SHE'S GOTTA BE AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE. WE'VE GOT TO FIND HER. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WE'RE GONNA LOSE-- SOPHIE? HOW DID YOU GET HERE? CAREFUL. SHE COULD BE A MIRAGE. WOULD YOU STOP? HOW DID YOU GET HERE? I FOLLOWED YOU ONTO THE BUS. BUT YOU WERE ASLEEP. I WAS PRETENDING. SEE, YOU'RE A BAD INFLUENCE. THE PUMPKIN DOESN'T LOOK VERY NICE LIKE IN THE BOOK. YOU'RE RIGHT. IT IS DIFFERENT. IT'S THE BAD THING. HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT? WHAT BAD THING? WELL, WELL. HELLO THERE. I DON'T BELIEVE WE'VE MET. AND THAT MEANS I'M IN TROUBLE 'CAUSE THE MAYOR'S SUPPOSED TO KNOW EVERYBODY. I'M SOPHIE. PARDON? SOPHIE. WHAT? SOPHIE! I CAN'T HEAR YOU. I SEEM TO HAVE A... LOLLIPOP IN MY EAR. THERE YOU ARE, SOPHIE. NO, THANKS. OK. NEAT TRICK. I'M MARNIE. CALABAR. AND THAT WASN'T A TRICK. I'M A WARLOCK IN MY OFF HOURS. AND YOU ARE? HUMAN. THIS IS MY BROTHER DYLAN. WE'RE AGGIE CROMWELL'S GRANDKIDS. WAIT A MINUTE. ARE YOU GWEN'S KIDS? YOU KNOW OUR MOM? WELL, I DID A LONG TIME AGO. IS SHE HERE WITH YOU? UH, NO, BUT THAT'S OK. SEE, WE CAME WITH OUR GRANDMA AND WE KIND OF LOST HER IN THE CROWD GETTING OFF THE BUS. DO YOU KNOW WHERE SHE LIVES? OF COURSE. SHE'S LIVED IN THE SAME HOUSE FOR 200 YEARS. I'LL GET BENNY TO RUN YOU UP THERE. ( Whistles ) C'MON. WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOU DOING THIS FOR-- HOWDY, MAYOR. WHAT'S THE RUSH? I'M ON MY LUNCH HOUR. FILET OF FISH. HAA! JUST KIDDING. WHAT'S THE DEAL? I FOUND A BUNCH OF CROMWELLS IN THE TOWN SQUARE. THEY NEED A LIFT UP TO THEIR GRANDMA'S PLACE. SURE. IT'S JUST OVER THE RIVER AND THROUGH THE WOODS. HAA! ACTUALLY, IT'S JUST TWO STREETS OVER AND UP A QUARTER MILE PAST THE OLD MOVIE THEATER. SAY HI TO AGGIE FOR ME. THERE YOU GO. HE'S A MUCH BETTER DRIVER THAN HE IS A COMEDIAN. HEY! THANKS FOR YOUR HELP. SO LONG, SOAPY. SOPHIE! IT'S NOT POLITE TO STARE. POLITE? LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW ILLEGAL IT IS TO DRIVE WITH NO EYEBALLS. FIRST TIME IN TOWN FOR YOU KIDS? YEAH. WE JUST GOT HERE ON THE BUS. IT'S SO AMAZING. YEAH. IT'S A PRETTY NICE PLACE. BETTER THAN A LOT OF GRAVEYARDS I'VE HUNG OUT IN. BUT THAT DON'T MEAN YOU KIDS CAN GO RUNNING AROUND HERE BY YOURSELVES. WHY NOT? WELL, LET'S JUST SAY THAT THERE ARE CHARACTERS AROUND HERE THAT AIN'T THE MOST SAVORY. LIKE THAT KID. LUKE. WHO IS HE? HE'S JUST A LOCAL PUNK. THINKS HE'S A BIG SHOT JUST BECAUSE HE GOT A NOSE JOB AND HAD A FEW WARTS REMOVED. CLAIMED SOME SHADOW CREATURE GAVE IT TO HIM. HAA! WELL, HERE WE ARE. CHEZ CROMWELL. COOL. THANKS FOR THE RIDE. DO YOU TAKE DOLLARS? DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. CATCH ME IN THE NEXT LIFE. HAA! SEE YA, KIDS. BYE. HE'S PROBABLY ANIMATRONIC. DISNEYLAND'S FULL OF STUFF LIKE THAT. YEAH. WHEN MR. LINCOLN DRIVES ME TO THE STORE, WE'LL TALK. WELL, IT'S LOCKED. BETTER HEAD HOME. NO WAY! THIS IS THE PERFECT CHANCE FOR ME TO TRY MY POWERS. POWERS? WHAT POWERS? I DON'T KNOW. I HAVEN'T TRIED THEM YET. ABRACADABRA. OPEN SESAME? AH, LET'S SEE... BIG IRON LOCK THAT KEEPS US OUT, OPEN UP YOUR BIG IRON MOUTH! YOU CALL THAT A SPELL? OUT AND MOUTH DON'T EVEN RHYME. WILL YOU BE QUIET? YOU COULDN'T OPEN A CAN OF DOG FOOD WITH A SPELL LIKE THAT. LOOK. I'M TRYING TO CONCENTRATE HERE. SOPHIE, HOW'D YOU DO THAT? I PUSHED. PLUS, I WISHED THE LOCK WOULD TURN INTO A FROG. THIS SHOULD DO IT. BUBBLE, BUBBLE, TOIL AND TROUBLE. SOMEBODY'S COMING. HI, GRANDMA. OH, MY STARS! HOW DID YOU GET HERE? ON THE BUS. I CAME TO START MY TRAINING, GRANDMA. YOUR TRAIN-- OH, IT WAS YOU OUTSIDE THE KITCHEN. I THOUGHT I HEARD SOMEONE LISTENING. I SUPPOSE I COULD ASSUME YOUR MOTHER DOESN'T KNOW YOU'RE HERE. I DARESAY THAT SHE'S GONNA BE VERY UPSET WHEN SHE FINDS YOU'RE GONE. CAN'T WE JUST CALL HER? NO, NO, DEAR. I'M AFRAID WE HAVEN'T WORKED OUT LONG-DISTANCE CALLING BETWEEN WORLDS YET. NO. I'LL HAVE TO TAKE YOU HOME MYSELF. BUT YOU CAN'T TAKE US HOME. YEAH. WE WANT TO HELP YOU FIGHT THE BAD THING. YEAH, THE BAD THING OR THE FORCE FIELD. WHATEVER IT IS. YOU SAID YOU NEEDED ANOTHER CROMWELL WITCH. THAT COULD BE ME. YOU CAN TRAIN ME. I SUPPOSE IT WOULD BE ALL RIGHT IF YOU COULD STAY A LITTLE WHILE. AS LONG AS WE GET YOU HOME BEFORE MIDNIGHT IN THE MORTAL WORLD. BUT THAT'S ONLY TWO HOURS FROM NOW. WELL, DON'T PANIC, DEAR. YOU SEE, TIME WORKS DIFFERENTLY IN HALLOWEENTOWN. TWO HOURS THERE MIGHT BE TWO DAYS HERE. OR TWO WEEKS IF WE'RE ON VACATION. WHAT'S THIS, GRANDMA? AH, YOU'VE DISCOVERED THE WITCHES GLASS. IT'S BEEN HANDED DOWN THROUGH THE CROMWELL CLAN OVER MANY GENERATIONS. I'VE BEEN USING IT TO KEEP MY EYE ON THINGS. NOW THE GLASS SHOWS SOME EVIL FORCES AT WORK HERE IN HALLOWEENTOWN. THE WORST IS YET TO COME. HA HA HA HA HA! WHAT CAN WE DO TO STOP IT? I'LL SHOW YOU. FOLLOW ME. MERLIN HIMSELF USED THIS TALISMAN TO END THE DARK AGES OVER IN THE MORTAL WORLD, AND I THINK IT'S JUST THE THING TO TACKLE OUR TROUBLES HERE IN HALLOWEENTOWN. ( Beeping ) ARE YOU COOKING CHOWDER, GRANDMA? I LIKE CHOWDER. OH, NO, DEAR. THIS IS WITCHES BREW. IT'S A LITTLE RECIPE THAT I PICKED UP IN THE 6th CENTURY, AROUND KING ARTHUR'S TIME. KING ARTHUR? HOW'S THIS STUFF GONNA HELP? OH, BY BRINGING THIS TALISMAN BACK TO LIFE. PRETTY. ARE YOU GONNA USE YOUR MAGIC TO RAISE SOME SPIRITS, HAVE A BIG SANCE, AND CALL ON THE FORCES OF DARKNESS TO GET IT GOING? NO. I'M JUST GONNA FILL IT UP AND SEE IF THE LIGHT GOES ON. IF I CAN GET IT LIT AND INSTALL IT PROPERLY, IT SHOULD SUFFICE TO DRIVE AWAY THIS FORCE THAT THREATENS US. THAT'S IT? YOU JUST FILL IT UP? I DO HAVE TO SAY A SPELL OVER IT. THAT'S WHY I CAME TO ASK YOUR MOTHER TO HELP ME. YOU SEE, SPELLS ARE MUCH MORE POWERFUL WHEN MORE THAN ONE WITCH JOINS IN. ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE CROMWELLS. WELL, I'LL HELP YOU. THAT'S VERY SWEET OF YOU, DEAR, BUT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN TRAINED YET. AND SINCE YOUR MOTHER ISN'T OF THE MIND TO HELP, I GUESS I'M JUST ON MY OWN. ( Chanting Spell ) OH, DRAT! THAT'S WHAT I GET FOR TRYING TO USE INSTANT. IT JUST DOESN'T WORK LIKE IT DOES WHEN YOU MAKE IT FROM SCRATCH. WELL, THAT'S SOMETHING I CAN HELP YOU WITH. I CAN COOK. IF YOU COUNT POURING CEREAL. OOW! WELL, LET'S LOOK AT THE ORIGINAL RECIPE. COME OVER HERE. LET'S SEE... THAT'S IT. VAMPIRE'S FANG, HAIR OF A WEREWOLF, THE SWEAT OF A GHOST. I SUPPOSE WE COULD GET THESE INGREDIENTS IN TOWN. BUT WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO REVEAL OUR TRUE PURPOSE. I CAN'T BE CERTAIN WHO TO TRUST ANYMORE. LET'S DO IT! YEAH! ALL RIGHT. THEN IT'S SETTLED. TV: ARE YOU FIGHTING A LOSING BATTLE WITH HAIR LOSS? IS HAIR GROWING EVERYWHERE BUT WHERE YOU NEED IT? STOP LOSING IT. STOP THINNING. START WINNING WITH OUR SPECIAL FORMULA FOR HAIR REPLACEMENT. IT WORKS LIKE MAGIC. NOW THAT WORKS JUST LIKE MAGIC. DYLAN? MARNIE? SOPHIE? MOTHER! IS THERE GONNA BE A HALLOWEEN PARTY TODAY, GRANDMA? EVERYBODY'S ALL DRESSED UP. THIS IS THE WAY WE ALWAYS DRESS, DEAR. THE PEOPLE WHO STARTED YOUR HALLOWEEN JUST IMITATED OUR TRADITIONS. MORTALS SEE, MORTALS DO. THAT'S THE WAY YOUR MOTHER RAN INTO YOUR FATHER-- BY CRASHING A HALLOWEEN PARTY. HE LOVED HER WITCHES COSTUME. HELLO, AGGIE. HELLO, SADIE. WHAT ARE YOU SO HAPPY ABOUT? I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T WANT TO COME. I DECIDED THIS REALLY IS A DREAM. SO WHY WORRY? I LIKE HALLOWEEN PARTIES. WHY DO YOU HAVE TO LIVE SO FAR AWAY, GRANDMA? WELL, THERE WAS A TIME WHEN GHOULS AND MONSTERS AND WITCHES AND VAMPIRES AND ALL THE REST OF US COULD BE TOGETHER. THIS IS DARK TIME. IT WAS A BAD MIX BECAUSE HUMANS FEARED US AND TRIED TO DESTROY US. SO WE DID OUR BEST TO MAKE THEM MISERABLE IN RETURN. BUT IT WAS TURNING US EVIL, WHICH WE ARE NOT. SO WE DECIDED TO CREATE OUR OWN WORLD. OH, KINDA LIKE WHEN MARNIE AND I GOT SEPARATE ROOMS. PRECISELY. AND FROM THAT DAY ON WE WERE ABLE TO SETTLE DOWN AND HAVE HOMES AND CHILDREN AND JOBS. AND AN EXPERT BOWLING LEAGUE. WE GET REALLY GOOD MOVIES. LIKE "IT'S A WONDERFUL DEATH." OH, CLOSED? HARRIET. THE MAYOR. OH, CHILDREN... CALABAR? COULD I SPEAK TO YOU FOR A MOMENT? OF COURSE, WHA-- HELLO AGAIN, SOAPY. SOPHIE. OH, I THINK I HAVE AN EXTRA SUNDAE. AAH. HA HA HA. CALABAR, I JUST RAN INTO HARRIET, AND SHE'S COMPLETELY CHANGED. HER FACE-- SHE WAS LIKE A WILD ANIMAL. AND SHE WAS FINE A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO. REALLY? THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU ABOUT. IF SHE'S LIKE THE OTHERS, THEN BY TOMORROW, SHE'LL HAVE DISAPPEARED ALTOGETHER. I HAVE TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU, AGGIE. I DIDN'T TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY ABOUT THIS THING AT FIRST. I THINK YOU'VE UNCOVERED SOMETHING VERY SERIOUS. WHAT IS IT? WHAT'S WRONG? WELL, I DON'T HAVE ALL THE DETAILS YET BUT I DO KNOW ONE THING. I WANT YOU TO LEAVE THIS ALONE FOR NOW. ESPECIALLY WITH THE CHILDREN. IT'S MUCH TOO DANGEROUS FOR YOU TO BE INVOLVED WITH BY YOURSELF. PROMISE ME THAT? YOU CROMWELLS ARE IMPOSSIBLE. JUST GIVE ME TWO DAYS. JUST TWO DAYS. THAT'S ALL. COME ALONG, CHILDREN. BUT LET'S BE REAL CAREFUL. AND, MARNIE, NOT A WORD-- OH, MARNIE! SHE'S FOUND THE BROOMS. FLYING BROOMS! WOW! WELL, MARNIE... GRANDMA, LOOK AT THESE THINGS. YES, THERE A BIT MORE SNAZZIER THAN WHEN I WAS A GIRL. CAN I GET ONE, PLEASE? PLEASE, GRANDMA, PLEASE. YES. WELL, IT IS THE RITE OF PASSAGE FOR WITCHES YOUR AGE. YES! WELL, LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT YOUR EYE ON OUR WINDSWEEPER 5000. IS THAT A GOOD ONE? WELL, LET'S SEE HERE. UNIBODY CONSTRUCTION. WOOO! CHROME DETAILING. A MICROCHIP DIRECTIONAL SYSTEM. IT'S THE TOP OF THE LINE. IF YOU THINK YOU CAN HANDLE IT. HANDLE IT? THIS IS A CROMWELL YOU'RE TALKING TO, DEAR. SHE'LL BE AN EXPERT IN NO TIME. CHECK IT OUT. WELL, HOW DO YOU MAKE IT GO? YOU KNOW, BY MAGIC. OH, RIGHT. I KNEW THAT. HOW SWEET. BUYING LITTLE MARLIE HER FIRST BROOM, HUH? IT'S MARNIE. THIS IS A LOCAL BOY. LUKE. HEY, DON'T SELL ME TOO SHORT THERE, GRAMMY. I'M SOMETHING OF A BIG CHEESE AROUND HERE. MAYBE I COULD SHOW YOU AROUND SOMETIME. BUY YOU AN ICE CREAM. THE ABOMINABLE SNOWMAN HAS A LITTLE SHOP DOWN THE STREET. YOU KNOW, I WAS KIND OF HUNGRY, BUT THEN I SMELLED SOMETHING STINKY. IT MUST'VE BEEN THE BIG CHEESE. PERHAPS ANOTHER TIME. YEAH. LIKE NEVER. YOU KNOW, IF YOU PEOPLE WERE SMART, YOU'D BE NICE TO ME. I'M FRIENDS WITH SOME VERY POWERFUL CREATURES AROUND HERE, YOU KNOW. OH, THAT LUKE DUDE, HE'S TURNED INTO SUCH A WEINER. ALL RIGHT NOW, IF YOU WANT TO BE TOTALLY RAD, YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE THE DAY-GLO BRISTLES. NOW, THE PURPLE DRAGONFLY HERE, IT'S AWESOME, BUT I PREFER METALLIC BLUE MYSELF. THIS ONE. IT'S PERFECT. CAN I GET IT, GRANDMA? PLEASE? WELL, DO YOU WANT ME TO WRAP THAT UP FOR YOU? NO. WE'LL FLY IT OUT. WOOOOO! GRANDMA, THIS IS SO TOTALLY COOL. WELL, THERE'S A REASON WHY WITCHES DON'T DRIVE MINIVANS. WHAT KIND OF MAGIC MAKES IT GO? MAGIC IS REALLY VERY SIMPLE. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS WANT SOMETHING AND THEN LET YOURSELF HAVE IT. HANG ON TIGHT. LET'S SEE WHAT THIS CAN DO. WHOOOO! WOOOO!

I WANTED TO HELP GRANDMA FIGHT THE BAD THING. AND I CAME TO GET MY TRAINING. TRAINING? AND I TRIED TO STOP THEM, MOM, BUT THEY HYPNOTIZED ME. AND I THOUGHT YOU WERE BRAVE. HEY, THIS IS MOM. STOP IT. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANY MORE EXCUSES. I WANT YOU ALL TO GET BACK ON THAT BUS BECAUSE WE ARE GOING HOME. BUT, MOM, GRANDMA NEEDS HELP. AND SINCE YOU WON'T HELP HER, SHE NEEDS THE ONLY OTHER CROMWELL WITCH THERE IS. ME. YOU ARE NOT A WITCH. OH, YES I AM, NO THANKS TO YOU. YOU WERE GONNA LET MY POWERS GO AWAY FOREVER. MARNIE, THERE'S SO MUCH MORE INVOLVED IN THIS THAN YOU UNDERSTAND. I UNDERSTAND THAT I AM HERE. AND I'VE GOT A BROOM, AND I'M GONNA LEARN EVERYTHING THAT GRANDMA CAN TEACH ME. YOU WILL NOT! IT'S HER BIRTHRIGHT. SHE WAS BORN IN THE HUMAN WORLD AND HUMAN IS WHAT SHE'LL BE. NO, I WON'T. YOU PUT THAT BROOM DOWN RIGHT NOW, YOUNG LADY. YOU ARE GROUNDED. SAY GOODBYE TO GRANDMA, EVERYBODY. IT'S TIME FOR US TO GO HOME. BYE, GRANDMA. BYE. MARNIE? THANKS, GRANDMA. IT WAS A GREAT RIDE. C'MON, SWEETIE. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH MY TIE! JUST LOOK AT IT.

YOU USED TO LIKE IT. OR HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN THAT PART? UH, NO. WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? I HAVE NO IDEA. YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS HOPED YOU'D COME BACK. NOW HERE YOU ARE. SAY, I OUGHT TO SHOW YOU AROUND. WE COULD TAKE THE STICKS RIVER CRUISE, HAVE A LITTLE DINNER, AND I COULD SHOW YOU ALL OUR OLD HAUNTS. UH, ACTUALLY, I'M TRYING TO LEAVE. IT SEEMS THE BUS WAS DELAYED, AND I WAS HOPING... YOU WERE HOPING THE MAYOR COULD HELP YOU OUT. I'M SORRY. EXCUSE ME, SIR. I'LL GET RIGHT TO THE POINT. I HAVE A VERY URGENT MESSAGE. SOMEBODY'S ON PINS AND NEEDLES. PINS AND NEEDLES. HA HA HA HA! THIS IS AN EMERGENCY. WON'T TAKE LONG. JUST STAY PUT. I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO FOR YOU WHEN I RETURN. THANK YOU. WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT? WELL, OBVIOUSLY, HE'S MOM'S OLD BOYFRIEND. MARNIE. I GUESS YOU LIKE MAGIC WHEN HE DOES IT, HUH? THAT'S ENOUGH. AND IF YOU MARRY HIM, I AM NOT CALLING HIM DAD. I'M NOT MARRYING ANYONE, AND THIS DISCUSSION IS OVER. WE'RE GOING HOME. GO AWAY, LUKE. I'M NOT IN THE MOOD. FAMILY TROUBLE, HUH, GRAMMY? GUESS IT'S JUST YOU AGAIN. YOU KNOW, IT MUST GET PRETTY FRUSTRATING, FIGHTING THIS THING ALL ALONE, NO ONE BELIEVING YOU. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT? I KNOW YOU'VE GOT MERLIN'S TALISMAN. AND HE WANTS IT. HE? WHO IS HE? YOU DON'T KNOW, HUH? THAT'S FUNNY, BECAUSE HE KNOWS ALL ABOUT YOU. AND ABOUT THAT BREW YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON TOO. WELL, IF HE'S SO POWERFUL, WHY IS HE HIDING? WHY DOESN'T HE REVEAL HIMSELF? YOU SEE, THAT'S WHY I'M HERE. HE WANTS TO REVEAL HIMSELF. TO YOU. C'MON, GRAMMY, ADMIT IT. YOU'RE DYING TO KNOW, RIGHT? OR IS THE BIG, POWERFUL CROMWELL WITCH AFRAID? I DON'T FEAR HIM OR ANY CREATURE. TAKE ME TO HIM. BUT, MOM, YOU CAN GO HOME IF YOU WANT TO. I MEAN, SOPHIE PROBABLY DOESN'T BELONG HERE, AND DYLAN THINKS HE'S HALLUCINATING, ANYWAY. I'LL BE ALL RIGHT BY MYSELF. MARNIE, YOU'RE 13. BUT ALL THE OTHER WITCHES GET TO DO ALL KINDS OF STUFF WHEN THEY'RE 13. JUST BECAUSE YOUR GRANDMOTHER SAID THAT YOU WERE A WITCH DOESN'T MAKE YOU ONE. SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO TELL ME. I COULD FEEL IT. I AM A WITCH, RIGHT? RIGHT? SHH. SO IT'S TRUE. I AM A WITCH. WELL, HOW COME I NEVER KNEW? ALL THIS WEIRD STUFF THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING TO SOPHIE, DID THAT STUFF HAPPEN TO ME? YES. YES, YOU SHOWED SIGNS OF HAVING POWERS, AND I HID THEM FROM YOU, JUST LIKE I AM DOING WITH SOPHIE. AND I DID IT FOR YOU. BECAUSE THIS IS NOT YOUR WORLD. YOUR FATHER WAS HUMAN, AND THAT'S THE WORLD THAT WE LIVE IN. PERIOD. LOOK. IF YOU WANT TO GIVE UP YOUR ROOTS, THAT'S FINE, BUT I DON'T. AND IT'S NOT RIGHT FOR YOU TO TRY TO MAKE ME. LOOK.

WILL YOU SHUT UP! SORRY. GIVE ME THE TALISMAN! NEVER! THEN SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES. NO! GO! YOU SAID SHE'D BE SAFE! YOU CANNOT ESCAPE ME, OLD WOMAN! THE CREATURE HASN'T BEEN BORN THAT'S QUICK ENOUGH TO CATCH A CROMWELL. MOTHER! GRANDMA! GET THEM! LEAVE MY FAMILY ALONE! I'M OUTTA HERE. WASTREL YOUTH! BE THEE VANQUISHED BY MY POWERS.
