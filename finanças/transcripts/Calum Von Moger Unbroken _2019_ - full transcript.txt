Once again, this is jet south flight J2678... ...now boarding at gate launch number 42. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the seatbelt sign has now been switched off and you are free to move about the cabin. We direct... - Dude! - Dude. Fuck! He's massive, man! Look at his legs! I think Calum is very genuine, even with all this exposure, fame. It's never gotten to him. He's always been very humble. You got to do the front double bars, all right? Yeah. Let's have you put them up there, man. - Hold on. - Yeah! What the fuck? You're the best, Calum. Love you, Calum. - Yeah, Team Von Moger! - Fuck Bradley! ♪ ♪ This is the... You expect me to jump, right? All through the way. I gotta do what? You'll hit bottom with all that muscle. No look. Get up. I hear you brought a friend to the gym. Oh yeah. This is my buddy Chris. - Chris Bumstead. - New friends. How is the pump coming along? As the shirt says? Filthy. Very Filthy. And if it's not filthy, I'll just go outside, grab some dirt and just rub it. So it looks filthy. So what's the plan here? I don't even really know. You know? You hear about the crazy Calum and his adventures, and first thing we do, he wants me to-- he wants to try and curl like four hundred pounds or something. But I'm open to try anything once. So, we're going to put some plates on the bar and see where it goes. Do you feel confident? Yeah. You got eight plates on this bloody thing. That was not very confident. - Are you confident? Yeah. - Yeah. We'll give it a try. So we each go... we go, we go up? I'm going to go one, two, three... On three? One, two and then three, lift. Three lift, okay. - Ready? One, two, okay. - Yeah. - And get back swing, too. - Yeah. One, two, three. Try once more. One, two... - Did you feel that? - No. You good? Are you good? No. Injury from the game. - Breathe. Breathe. - I'll catch you later. See ya bicep. - Yeah, it's game over. - Need some ice? Yeah, I felt it. It felt like it popped. Sounded like a pop and a jolt. It's like. It hurts all the way up here. Can you do like this? No, it hurts, man. Are you calling slate? Everybody set? Yes. All right. Calum, how much weight you think you lost from these injuries overall, you think? Uh, about up to like 40, 50 pounds, muscles. Yeah. Yeah. This year was the most challenging, the most difficult. I got these terrible injuries, the house, the fires, so many things that are trying to unsettle me and knock me off my feet. But... it's either gonna make you or break you. Yeah. There's like two girls in the rooms as well. They're asleep, fast asleep. Yeah. I got approached by Steve Jones who is a producer making a movie based off the lives of the Weider brothers, Joe and Ben Weider. So he asked me to play young Arnold. So I decided to take that on and that's due to start filming in November. Yeah, it's just-- I gotta do the voice lessons and get my lines down and see how we go. Look at this. I haven't really had a chance to practice 'cause I've just had heaps of stuff going on and people over and I haven't even had a chance to look at the script yet. So we'll see. I wish I could have done zoology and university but I wasn't really academic at school. Didn't study enough. So I just went into the workforce and just started picking up jobs. And when I was working with the outdoor adventure tour guide, all the kids and stuff used to call me like "Arnie" or "Buffman," "Terminator," and all these different nicknames. You and I were both not fit to drive home so James was nominated as the driver to take us home. I had a friend walk into the GNC I was working at. He had this idea of making a little motivational YouTube video. That kind of blew up and then all of a sudden I had a lot of interest from supplement companies in the U.S. reaching out to me and even wanting to manage me and things like that. So I just went with everything. They actually flew me out to the States to negotiate contracts and all that sort of stuff. I had no idea what I was doing. I had no idea how to look at a contract. But, you know, I walked the tight rope and just figured it out. Ended up getting a visa and the sponsorship and started. Coming over here was a shock at the start. Getting a car, getting an apartment, living around other people. I had to, like, kind of slow down talking. Americans don't pick up all the lingo straight up. The slang's a bit different, but it was exciting and fun. But I think Australia is a more beautiful place. From where I grew up, the beaches and stuff was nicer than here, I think. Oh, my turn. - Fifty back. - He cut ya. - He cut ya. - He cut me, he did, too. - Yeah. - Ow! It's the right card, you idiot. As a child, uncomplicated. You were just easy-going and you'd follow your brothers and follow the animals. Animals were always a part of Calum's life. - Yeah. - Always. I was born in Castlemaine in Central Victoria. And I lived there on a little farm for the first nine years, eight years of my life. Growing up was just, you know, the usual stuff. Catching chickens in the backyard. You know, going over to my mate's place, jumping these dams. All the outdoorsy type of stuff. We had a very strict routine growing up. You know, we had to wake up and polish our shoes, comb our hair over to the side, and, you know, we all would sit down and have breakfast together. Mom would make our lunches. You know, we'd go to school. We have to wear a little tie... and a uniform. Went to a very small school. It was just three other kids in my E level at that school. And the school was an old church. So, it wasn't much, you know, to begin with. And then we moved to the coast. Moved out to Anglesea when I was about eight years old. And growing up down there was awesome. With my mates when I was older we'd go to the beach every weekend or after school, run down to the beach, go to the surf club, go to the gym, do our little workouts, run down to the shops, eat heaps of food. It was just a great kind of a place to grow up. There's a lot of coastline to do a lot of, you know, fishing and swimming and stuff like that. So we would always find ways to entertain ourselves, you know. Most of it revolved around jumping off piers into water. Had a pretty kind of rascally childhood. Were you like at Daredevil when you were little? Like, you know, do like stunts and stuff like that? Um, not so much of a Daredevil, just trying to keep up with my older brothers or my friends or, you know, just getting, kind of, doing dares I guess a little bit. Yeah. Were your parents strict when you were growing up? Yeah. Yeah. I would say they were pretty strict. They disciplined us all if we stepped out of line. You know, there's six of us so there's not a lot of patience. I got one little sister and I got four brothers. And my oldest brother is six years older than me. He was kind of quieter. He wasn't too much of a troublemaker. That's Marlon. Then Harley's a year younger than Marlon and then Alex is about two years older than me. So I used to kick around trying to keep up with him. So a lot of stuff that he got into, I'd get into. You know, boxing, bodybuilding. And then there's my little brother and my little sister. Eddie's like five years younger than me. So he was, you know, he'd try and keep up with us boys as well. Oh my gosh. Walter. He was dad's favorite son. My brother taught me about that word when I was younger, integrity. I remember having a lesson in the garage. And he taught me what that word meant at a young age, which was useful, and it's helped me all the way through up until now. My brand is my name and myself. My merchandise line, it's mostly just training gear, training apparel. It's a really cool, unique way to connect with the fans and the followers. It's all got kind of a meaning behind it. It's not just anything. It's like it will be catchphrases or things that I say. Or things that relate with me or my background or anything like that. There's so many different parts to it. There's like the supplements, there's the clothing, there's the competitions, there's social media. You know, expos, it's hard to see where they're going. I remember when they were huge. When I first started going to them, they were a lot of fun. But how many times do people go to expos? I guess, you know, there's always gonna be younger generations upcoming... ♪ ♪ The very first one I remember. I remember just having a little line, and then in few years, there's crazy lines. And I appreciate it so much. I really do. To see all those people who've looked up to me or they've taken something or I've affected them or helped with their training or they've been inspired or I made them feel better or whatever. That's a very special thing and then every time I hear their little story or they tell me something then there's a little connection. And I can say hey, they took a little piece out of me and they got something out of it and I helped them and that is satisfying for me to see other people having those good experiences. ♪ ♪ Sometimes your just gonna have complete strangers you never knew or heard of and they're nicer than the people you know. So there's a lot of good things out there. There are a lot of good people out there and you just got to sift through. You just got to take all the good and discard all whatever bad, negative stuff. Just forget it. My first competition, I did the under 19s or the teenage A&B Championships, Victorian Championships. That was my first ever show. I won that one. That was a lot of fun. Probably one of my favorite shows, you know, my first one there. So I went on to the bigger shows in the WFF and the NABBA and then ended up doing the Mr. Universe shows, too. I think one of the beautiful things about doing these shows was the opportunity to travel. I always wanted to explore. I always wanted to see the world. And it was great that I could do that, at the same time as, you know, doing something that I love. So I always made time after every single Universe show to go and explore a little bit of, you know, the area-- Europe, Italy, Spain, France, wherever it was. At that stage, everything was paid for out of the pocket. I had to live. I had to earn money to feed myself. I was doing two other jobs, three other jobs just to make the ends meet. So just to survive, but yes. So I couldn't put everything into bodybuilding because I had to focus on life as well. My first job I had when I was twelve years old, stacking shelves at a local grocery store, café. Yeah, I had a bunch of jobs. I've worked at a butcher's supermarket. I've worked in daycare, like in after school care. Then I got a job painting, building, landscaping. I was an outdoor adventure tour guide for a few years. You know, mountain bike riding, canoeing with school groups and stuff like that. Even when I was landscaping, I would start at 7:30 in the morning it'd be... all the tools, digging holes and trenches all day. I'd be wrecked out there. And at the end of the day, I'd still go to the gym and train. No matter how fucked I was, I would still do it, you know. It was hard to be a bodybuilder, doing manual labor. For a long time it was very hard to gain weight. Right, it was hard to build muscle. Yeah, yeah. Then mum, believe it or not, she didn't like me going to the gym, instead of doing homework, probably. You know, I'd be there after school. So she was against it. She didn't like me growing my muscles big. She was a model in her day. So she liked slim and elegant, you know, probably a more cross-fit look but I was not into that at all. It kind of pushed me to do even more, like, she was against it. So I just wanted to do it even more because you naturally rebel when you're a teenager. So I started winning some shows and started doing really well and she kind of swung around. See you later... - You coming? - Yeah. Caffeine. Nothing, nothing has really stopped me from feeling tired. But it's all right. It's almost 11:30. I'm just waiting for a dialect coach to help with my Arnold Schwarzenegger accent. Arnold! - Hello. - Hi. How are you? Hi! Great. Thanks. How's it going? It's been a bit of a crazy week but, yeah, so... - Okay, cool. - ...but anyway. Well, just to give you a kind of insight as to what's happening here - in regards to me as the coach. - Yeah. When I working with everybody else it's different with them than it is for you... - Yeah. - ...when I'm working because Their character's voices aren't as well known as Arnold Schwarzenegger's. - Ah. - So the pressure's... the pressure is not as great with them as obviously-- It has to be an authentic dialect whether that dialect may bend. With you, because it's Arnold Schwarzenegger's voice, we have to like... - Nail it, yeah. - We have to get it dead on. Which is kind of why I am a little bit more like: "I got to work with Calum, - I got to work with Calum," because... - Yeah, yeah, okay. ...I like what you said before, "It's not an impersonation. - It's the voice of..." - It's the voice... So let's just listen to him a little bit to get you in the mind, you know, - to get it, to get the sound going. - Okay, yeah. That'll help, yeah. Hear this. Steroids are taken eight to nine to ten weeks before competition. It's not a healthy thing but it's being used. - Did you take them? - I take them. I took them, yeah, up until the competition. - All right. Let's hear it. - Okay. All right, scene 101. "Maybe I'll let him wipe my ass." Mm... "Maybe I'll let him wipe my ass." My voice is a bit croaky because it's like, hang on... Yeah, my voice-- it's like-- I have a tired voice right now, it's, like, croaky from the expo. But I hope it doesn't-- - Does it affect a little bit? - Yes. It sounds a bit different? Um, keep drinking the water. Um... I think what will help you is I want you to play this back. - The video that I've sent you. - Yeah. I want you to stop and start it because you got such a good ear. - That's you're way into this voice here. - Yeah, okay. So, let's shy away from the script for a second. - Yeah. Play the video. - Stop and start it and stop it - and repeat, next sentence. - Okay. Repeat, next sentence to get you into that voice. Yeah. Okay. The greatest feeling you can get in a gym, or the most satisfying feeling you can-- "The greatest feeling you can get in a gym or the most satisfying feeling you can get in the gym is the pump. Like your skin is going to explode in a minute. You get that really tight feeling like somebody is blowing air into the muscle. Tight feeling like somebody blowing air into the muscle. Blowing air into the muscle. Somebody blowing air into the muscle. Blowing air into the muscle." Somebody blowing air into-- "Somebody blowing air into the muscle." "It's like somebody blowing air-- blowing, blowing air into the muscle." Muscle, muscle, yeah. "Tight feeling it's like somebody blowing air into the muscle." I mean I like getting the feeling of coming in the gym. I'm getting the feeling of coming at home. I'm getting the feeling of coming backstage when I pump up when I pose up in front of five thousand people. I get the same feeling. So, I'm coming day and night. Oh it's terrific, right? So, you know, I'm in heaven. I've always known it line for line. It's bad. I mean it's terrific, right? So, you know, I'm in heaven. "So, you know, I'm in heaven." Oh my gosh, he's a freak. "Can you believe how much I am in heaven?" "So, can you believe how much I am in heaven?" "So, can you believe how much I am in heaven?" He really pronounced the "I am." - He really separated those two words. - Exactly. "So, can you believe how much I am in heaven?" So, can you believe how much I am in heaven? "So, can you believe how much I am in heaven?" - Heaven. - Heaven. Heaven. And when it comes to the day of the contest, I'm his father. There's something going on here. - You know, um... - Yeah. Okay. I've seen you do it. It's, it's brilliant. Um, that's where we've got to... we've got to be able to try and find that. And then all we'll do when we're on set together is polish up. Hey, Calum, do you remember we were just doing-- Tweak this bit here. Don't forget this bit here. - Okay. - You've all got it. I'll just coach you on the things that we've got in the back... - Yeah, okay. Yeah. - ...you know? Um, I can't stress that enough. So I will give you-- I will be as flexible as I possibly can be with my time. - Sounds good. Yeah, yeah. - All right? Sounds like fun? Sounds good. Yeah, great. - Okay. Fantastic. - All right. - Thank you very much, Victoria. - Get some rest. Thanks for your time. I will. Yeah, yeah. And I'll touch base tomorrow morning. And we'll just, take it, yeah, take it from there. - That will be good. Okay. - Perfect. All right. Thanks, Victoria. Have a great day. Okay. We'll talk soon. - Cheers. Bye. - Okay. Bye. Okay... Oh my gosh, it's like two-- uh... just over-- a little bit after two weeks. So I have two weeks to-- I don't even know all the lines. I don't-- like, I don't know them off by heart. And I haven't got the accent. So, I have two weeks. I hate to disappoint. That's what I hate the most is when someone is disappointed. I hate disappointing people. I'm used to winging a lot of stuff. Okay, I really am. I'm used to not really-- like, with extreme focus but without the preparation. Sometimes, and I've done that with a lot of stuff. Okay, I wouldn't know or I haven't got the... patience or something to study or research or understand something but I want to perform. You know, I only have two weeks. I've got this expo this weekend. During the next week I'm trying to keep it open so I can practice. And then I have another-- I fly to Brisbane, do another expo, and then I have a few appearances, a few things to do. It's good. And then I just go to New Zealand and another expo. So, the timing is a bit hard. But, I can't make an excuse. It's just-- it is what it is, just have to work around it. Yeah. I'll eat this peanut slab and go to bed. Yep. But you couldn't pull this with Franco because Franco's pretty smart. "Franco's pretty smart but Franco's a child. And when it comes to the day of the contest, I'm his father. He comes to me for advices. So it's not that hard for me to give him... the wrong advices." Cheeky devil. Ah jeez, let me write this down, like Vicki said. Hey, Calum. Thanks for recording that. So, listen back to the dialect there... open up a little bit in "Franco," "child," "smart," those kind of sounds. If you play your line back up to "child" and then play his up to "child," and then keep going back and forth, you'll notice the difference there. And then the hesitation sound, "uh." And you can see his's sounds a little bit more open and yours is a little tighter and then he has a little splashiness at the end of "and", and... I will practice as soon as I get back. Okay. Right... I have to go from-- have to go to... different Calum. I have to turn into expert Cal. I need to-- I need energies. I need the energies for the children. Little child. Little child at the expos. And I have to coordinate everyone else, too. So that they can come. My head's going to pop. Where's the AC? I'm gonna turn it on. Jeans, jeans, jeans, jeans, jeans, shorts, shorts... Give a little... Right in the face. Brush the fangs. Okay, I got to work out from 10:30 to 11:30 at the Muscle Beach. Then be back... expo from 11:30 to 1:30 and then 3:30 to 5. So, come check it out. I hope to see you there. Catch you later. On behalf of Captain Jason Stooges and your crew we'd like to thank you for traveling with Regional Express today. Looking forward to your company when you next choose to fly. I never wanted to be, like, a slave to social media and to my phone and just be constantly thinking what am I gonna put out. What content? Like constantly thinking what am I gonna feed the audience? And then for a long time I was doing that. I was like, okay, you know, I was under pressure, like, what do I do? It was good because that's how you grow your platforms and stuff like that. It definitely helped, but then I realized that I'm kind of missing out on reality. I'm missing out on life. I'm, like, not seeing what's going on in front of me. I'm not doing what I exactly want to do. So you're stuck in this, you know, social media world. Aw, aw. You don't want me to go? Don't want to go? I love fishing. I love animals. I love outdoor activities. You know, skateboarding. All that stuff. Anything that's kind of-- I'm a bit of a thrill-seeker, you know? I like... I like that sort of stuff. I'm a bit of an adrenaline junkie. Too cute. What's that? It's a bubble, it really is. And once you pop the bubble, once you get out of that one, oh you feel so much better. You-- there's no pressure, you don't give a shit about trolls, don't care about the haters, there's nothing that can affect you. It's your-- you're immune to it, you know. Anyone could say anything; it doesn't bother me because that's all on social media. It's all, you know, it's there, it's stuck in one place. So it doesn't affect me at all really. They can say whatever the heck they want. You know, good or bad. I appreciate the good and I ignore the bad. Doesn't, you know, it doesn't faze me. You're the only one who understands my English, Joe. Nobody cares about your accent. Have you heard mine? Just say the lines the way you want. You're making him more nervous, Joe. - What? - I cannot act. - Then don't act. - Just be yourself, Arnold. You told them I was a German Shakespearean actor. I'm so screwed. Arnold, Arnold, it's Hollywood. Nobody knows whether you've done Shakespeare in the park or your own damn garage. Just give a good flex, a nice smile, it will all be fine. I'm freaking out! Oh! Let's talk about the movie Bigger. I know you mentioned it before but take me through the process, like when you first got approached to do a role of Arnold, like... - Yeah. - Well, what was the initial thoughts that you had in your mind? It was a big honor to be able to stand in his shoes and play him in a part of history. And so that's why I took my training, I wanted to be as big as he was. And I did that voice acting classes. Took them very serious, so that I could, you know, make sure, try and to get his dialect down even though it's very hard. Physically, I wanted to be at least, you know, 245-250 pounds. Have that muscle mass. And I just-- I didn't want to look as ripped because they weren't as ripped back in the shows back then. I didn't want to have, you know, crazy, crazy muscle definition. So I just wanted to try and look as close to him as I could. And then I'm, yeah, just getting the voice acting lessons in as much as I could. And learning the lines and stuff. In the first scene, I was real nervous, I remember. Cause you have-- it's all on. There's everyone-- a lot of people in the room you can't see. And you're with all the other actors and extras and stuff. So you don't want to screw it up because you don't want to waste anyone's time or have to redo stuff. So I was a little bit nervous and then, at the start, it's just... the nerves kind of settled and, um, and just went with it. And I just enjoyed it, you know. And then, yeah, actually, we just finished filming and I blew my bicep out. How did it happen? Walk me through it. What happened exactly? While I was doing a full plate tandem bicep curl with Chris Bumstead this time... and I'd done it before. I done it a year ago, same time almost, exactly a year ago with my buddy Antoine. And we did these crazy reps with horrible weight on the bicep. And then I attempted it again. And I just-- I think I honestly I was just fatigued or I was tired or I just was-- my body was not ready for it. And I tore it. - Did you feel that? - No. You good? Are you good? No. See ya bicep. That sucked because it was my first serious injury. You know, I had little marker tears and sores and needles and stuff here and there but nothing like a major tear that needed surgery. That was the first big injury. You got a surgery pretty quickly, right? Yeah, about eight days after I tore it, I think it was, roughly. Yeah, straight after, yeah. How's the arm feeling today? Strong. It feels good. Feels like I shouldn't be getting surgery on it, honest. The wrist looks like it's kind of healing up. Sores. It's all gone down, the swelling and everything. But... Check out the guns. Yeah. We'll see. How you feeling about it? I guess, um, maybe a little bit nervous because you never know, it's a surgery. And then, I don't know what it will be like after, I guess. You're good. Everything went great. - I'm out of surgery? - Yeah. Yep, found the other end and they fixed it. No problem. - It'll be good. - How long did it go for? Only about an hour. Tourniquet time was like twenty-seven minutes. - Felt like two minutes. - Yeah. I know. - Great, weird right? - I guess. Oh, my God. All right. Speedy recovery, okay? Thanks. You don't want to smile for the camera? Good chow? He's still eating. I'm sorry. Fine. That okay? All right. Where did this graham cracker come from? Thank you for taking him. I have a very strict diet. Ice-cream is like the pinnacle of that diet. Ice-cream is a life force. I have a feeling somebody disagrees with you right now. Ice-cream is the pinnacle? I think Ice-cream makes everyone feel better. Are you in any pain right now, sweetheart? - Huh? - Do you have any pain? Pain? No way. I feel so good. Alrighty, don't move your arm, sweetheart. - That's for the nerve block. - Ah this is my strong arm. I know but don't move it right now. It's taking your blood pressure. Oh, yeah. - My blood pressure's pretty good. - It's good. - Don't move it just yet. Hold on. - Let's flip a coin. Heads, I can move it. Tails, I can't. Well I don't-- what side is the head, which side is the tails? Oh, it's heads. - Is that heads? - Yeah, we got a heads. Don't move your arm. Don't move your arm. Hold on, hold on. I'm taking your blood pressure, sweetheart. Very nice. I like you. How much? Man, this bicep is going to tell this bicep what it's missing out on. I'm going to be like, "Hey..." What is it missing out on? - Oh. - I forgot to write - that I gave him a Percocet. - Both bicep curls. This one is going to make this one so jealous. I doubt that. Maybe once it comes off. But I'm sure it's-- Feels so bad and he's like "Wha wha ohh yea, I have a bicep-- I have a dumbbell. You'll never get this. You can't kill me." And this arm will become so upset. Is he a funny drunk? Or does he not drink very often. He's funny when he's drunk. - Oh, okay. - Yeah. Yeah. Right. - Almost. - Almost? - Hold on, hold on. - Okay. Don't flex just yet. I'll let you know when you can start flexing. I can't really remember talking to the nurse or the doctors. I think they said it was all good. Yeah, there's not much I can do. Just chill here for a while and then... Have a nap, relax, eat your ice-cream, have some juice... It's very hard for me not to do stuff cause I like to get up and do things. Ice-cream and juice and that's, that is all. Just checking out Baz. Make sure he's all good. - Crickets. - Listen to the crickets. I feel so skinny. I feel like I've lost a lot of weight lately. Feels really good. I miss it. Training and stuff. It's like the life force for a bodybuilder. So taking that away is hard. It makes me feel better. It's all mental. If I sit down and stop and just be like thinking, "Oh how long is it gonna take to get better?" Well, one, it's gonna feel like it's gonna take twice as long. And, two, I won't be doing anything about it. If I just, you know, look after my health, my nutrition, do what I can, work train around an exercise, focus on different things, my weaknesses, whatever I can do, and feel good, right? - Yeah. - So, yeah. I always wanted big calves anyway. So now's as good time as any to train them as hard as I can for the next... every day, alright, five calf days, twice a day, morning and night. You'll see they're gonna be forced to grow. How's the pain medicine working? I stopped taking it. I only took it for, like, the day or two afterwards and... times it would hurt and you're sleeping... Like I'd wake up because I fucking twitched or I moved and then it hurts. It's not too bad. As long as I don't bump it or move my hands, my arms too much. Even like that, doing this, I can feel the... all the muscles working out in my forearm. So, I don't like to really move it at all. Fuck it. Oh yeah, because you might crunch your arm, eh? Yeah. I didn't think about that. Damn. What if I hold it up here? Yeah, okay. It's a little better. More like that. There you go. It's not the easiest. That's good. That's enough for today. My arm's disappeared. Whoa, it feels so weird. So went in there and, you know, your tendon was still right where it kind of was supposed to be. - Hadn't retracted at all. - Right. But, you know, 99 percent of it was totally ripped off the bone. - Yeah. - There was a big huge hematoma, or a collection of blood where it ripped off, too. So once I had, you know, gone in there, I was able to suck that out with the suction and then really easily, just with my finger, the whole thing just came off. So then it just flopped through the breeze. - So, definitely the right thing to fix. - Yes. So you had to cut off like-- obviously that tendon's short-- shorter now? - Yeah. - So does that mean being shorter, it's gonna be tighter? The bicep muscle is tighter? Initially, but then you'll stretch it out. - It will stretch out? - Yeah. So that's over this next month. We're just getting everything back out. - Now you got traveling coming up. - Yeah. You know, you also totally overpower this even though this is strong with your triceps. - Mm-hmm. - So I think the smartest thing to do - is put you into a brace. - Right. So what we'll do, we'll keep it so you can flex it all the way up. - Yeah. - But as far as getting the full - extension, it will limit that. - It will limit the... So we'll probably have it like at 45 degrees. - Yeah. - And then in like two weeks you could put up to 60 or 65 degrees. - Whatever the dial is, I'm not positive. - Okay. Yeah. And then within a month, - we'll get you full motion. - Mm-hm. And then we'll really start the physical therapy after that. All right. So I'm going to tell the brace guy to come in here - and fit you up, okay? - All right. - I'll be right back. - Thanks, man. Cheers. - Fucking feels weird. - Having range of motion? Yeah, the shoulders are odd. That's all right, but what I can't do is like this. Eh, there, it like, starts hurting. Ow! Ow! Why is it so-- I feel it right in there? Maybe because of the muscle tissue or something? It's probably because it's not stretched out, right? Because the tendon's slightly shorter, I don't know. And you're not allowed to go full stretch yet, right? I know. He doesn't want me to. No. Like I don't-- I don't want to. I don't-- I can't really make a bicep. Ah, now it's, like, achy. Ah! Now it's sore. I shouldn't have done that. Yeah, better just leave it alone. Oh man! It's broken. As small as my left bicep is, I don't like defeat... It's just a little bit small. I'm looking down. You know, when you look down at your arm and it's like "Damn, I gotta go train arms." Well, now I'm looking down, and it's like "Damn, I've never trained arms." I actually made a phone call to the manufacturer to see if they have something a little bit stronger than this. I think you'll be okay, but... if there's something bigger that we could get to you... - Yeah. - ...I think it'll be ideal. The more you move it, the more range you gain. - Okay. Yeah. - Okay? So, I don't want you to lock yourself at 60. Actually, a little stretch is good. So when you stand up just extend it out. I'll let the arm drop and this is your therapy. - All right. - All right. - Thanks very much. - My pleasure. I need a signature but let me grab one of the doctors here to just finish off. - Perfect. No worries. Thanks, man. - Welcome. Did you ever hear people criticizing you for this lift? People, like, saying, "Why is he doing that?" Oh probably. But I don't care, that's-- I'll do what I'm gonna do. You know, if you're someone that means something to me, if you're a friend, family, whatever, I knew, like, okay, talking some sense into me, I'd probably listen then, but people criticize. Or think it's hilarious or entertaining. So you can't please everyone. So, whatever. First day back at Gold's. - Yeah. - How does it feel? A bit weird. They're getting rid of all the old equipment. Putting this flashy new stuff. I like old stuff. Today I want to start actually pushing it a bit harder. Kind of morph my sanity then for my body right now. Shit. Ah, now it's coming back. It's catching up to me. Legs again today? I did them yesterday. So I was gonna go do, like, calves, abs and some light body stuff. Good. But the legs are good. I go all out on the legs probably, like, three times a week at the moment. I had the surgery, it was the 8th of December. So then, four or five weeks of recovery and then I started physical therapy. Just like you did the other day. Okay. There, there. - What about your extension? - Say out straight? - That's pretty good. - Oh yeah, extension. Oh! Don't go too hard. Don't go too hard, don't go too hard. All right, lie down and we'll test it again at the end. Brian does twice a week and helps to work on the range of motion, the supination of my wrist, soft tissue mobility, flexibility. This is more just to kind of get the joint to move a little bit too. Yeah, this is the first stage and then we do a bit of-- you'll see next. It's a blood occulation? Is it? Blood flow restriction. So this is calibrating his arm right now, so that it's more individualized for him. This blood flow restriction unit will make a very small amount of weight feel very heavy and it kind of tricks his body into thinking it's having a bigger pump than it really is. Yeah. It feels like when you're holding a hose and you feel the water running through it. Sort of feel like my veins. This is gonna help him maintain as much muscle as possible right now. He can't load up the bicep but what we can do is by using this machine it's gonna basically give him like a metabolic load almost. And as a result then, his body thinks it's producing, you know, a pump, more. Five pounds? Moving on. Going up. New PB. - He was on four before. - Oh man! Already feeling, like, the pump. Cause it feels like it's, like it's more of a pump without even doing anything. It's like, literally, it just feels like a painful pump. - How you doing? - Yeah, it's so sore. - Mm-hm. - Very. - Forty seconds. - Yeah. So, it's a proper workout for the old forearms. Gotta do something to keep you going. Yeah, I know. I should be doing it with both arms. - It's why Banffy sent you here? - Yeah, he knew. He knew. Calum, you've got small forearms, I'm going to send you to the forearm doctors. Holy shit! Look at the difference. Bodybuilding. Cross-fit. This one I even just feel, it's a little bit of weight, but it's still sore, so... If I see Chris Bumstead and a barbell, I'm running in the opposite direction. Now I can rotate it almost back to where it was. So once that's got the full range of motion, I can start with baby weights. He gave me the green light, so... the hardest part is over, now it's just progression, progression with caution. It's so thin but kind of looks like it got a little bit more life to it. Last time I did a bench press, late, late November. I might even shed a tear. This doesn't feel half bad. - That's not bad. - That's excellent. I've been holding back this whole time. Four months post-surgery and after four months I was pretty good. It wasn't a hundred percent lifting with my bicep but I was, you know, doing a lot of cable curls and my upper body was-- it was built back up. I'd caught it up again. My legs were strong as ever because I trained them a lot. And then, yeah. And then tell me about-- you went to Australia for an expo and then... I got invited to Australia to do an expo. And always, you know, I love to go home and stuff. So I decided to go back for this expo. I hadn't seen my brother for ages and, um... Yeah, decided to, uh, to go... rappelling. Not abseiling, not rock climbing, rappelling. And I wasn't even thinking anything over. I wasn't thinking the risks really because he knew all the safety stuff and showed me what was going on. Just make sure that you've got a harness on and attached onto a safety line I'm gonna put out. If you're going to be within sort of two meters of it. - Calum. - Yeah. I hear you guys are going to jump off this rock? - Yeah, my brother decided... - Ready and good to go? ...we would jump off of this cliff. Yeah, it seems pretty safe. Seems pretty legit. Brothers are crazy. I thought you were the crazy brother but apparently not. - This is where I get it from. - What the hell are we doing? This should be a great time if I make it up, out alive. If not, this is the last video. See you guys on the other side. So, I hear once you get down the bottom, you got to walk all the way around? Yeah, if you still have legs. If this rock falls off then it's just game over. - Well then you're pretty much dead. - Yeah. And you don't have to worry about anything for the rest of... your life because you don't have one. That's good. Now you're gonna keep your legs fairly straight. And lower your body until you're in an L position. When your body is like an L from here to here. Now, walk down a little bit. It's like walking down. - Oh shit! Shit, shit! - That's good. Help! My knee. I think I broke my knee. My knee is broken, bro. It's my right knee. The one you're holding is smashed. Oh this is bad. Yeah, I fell like-- I don't know like maybe ten feet or something. The rope caught me, thank God. Otherwise, I'd be dead. I remember hanging upside down with my leg torn in half and wrapped around the rope. I broke my knee. Yep, yep. - Let go of his hand. - Yep. - Let go of his hand. - Oh, man! Well, I heard a loud pop. I could rule out crack or a pop and it just looked out of whack, the whole shape of it, my leg. So, yeah, initially I thought was a broken bone but it turns out it was the muscle. Alex, can you pull me up, Alex? I could use a hand. My right knee is smashed. I heard it break. I can see the bone. My weak arm instinctively grabbing the rope to untangle myself and I tore the-- re-tore my bicep again. - You re-tore it, right? - Yeah, so, tore again this bicep. Tore my quadricep, and, yeah, they had to drag me up the side of the cliff and then get taken to the hospital. Oh shit! Ah, my legs. Oh, fuck! Calum, hang there for a second? - Can you hang there for a second? - Alex. I can't walk. - I'm going to drag you closer. - Step away from the edge. If the rope hadn't have held, if that little carabiner broke or wasn't strong enough, if the little bolt in the top of the cliff holding the rope was not in properly, then I would've fallen a hundred foot down to the rocks and the ocean below. That would have been my-- yeah, that would have been game over. - Is it here? - Yeah. - How bad is the pain? - Like, eight. - Pain... - Can you wiggle your toes? I've decided to fly back to L.A. as soon as possible to get the proper care here because I knew that I'd need it if I wanted to ever do, you know, what I want to do again, so... That was the most excruciating, traumatic experience I've experienced. That fall, the break, everything was just the worst so... So I was-- yeah, I was feeling pretty, pretty shattered. It was-- it was tough because... because the first thing you want to hear is, like, okay how soon can I do what I'm doing normally again? How soon am I gonna hear? What's the date that I'm gonna be better? How many months? There's no answers. No simple answer to that. No doctor, no person, no one can tell you, "Oh, you'll be healed in six months, nine months, twelve months." So that was hard to figure out for me. Okay, how long am I going to be out of the gym for? You know, I don't know what's going to happen. You don't know what to expect, you know. I was pretty, pretty broken. Pretty, pretty heartbroken. It was a shock to everybody when-- when it all happened. And for it to be a bicep and a knee injury, it was-- it was a hard hit for him. My name is Miguel, mostly, everybody calls me Miggy. I've been really good friends with Cal for about the last three to four years. I guess we met through some mutual friends at the gym and from there just picked up where we had kind of the same interests and stuff. And I hang out a little bit more, little by little. How's the rehearsing going for the new Twins movie? - Yeah. - Yeah, going pretty good. - Feeling pretty good. - Yeah, we're, uh, post-production now? - We're actually brothers. - Yeah. - Oh you're actually brothers? - Identical. - Just-- just not a hundred percent. - Yeah. Just split at birth. He was raised in Australia. A lot of kanga milk. - I came from a pouch. - Oh, that's why. It's been slow and he's the guy that kind of like, "Alright, I want to do it." Like, "I know I have these injuries, but I really want to go work out." He's not the type to just really stay at home and do nothing and recover. I had to go through this kind of really difficult time in processing everything, coping, whatever. And then accepting what is gonna be. Can you tell me more about your father and also, obviously, his very unfortunate incident and what actually happened and how that changed, you know, obviously his life and your life? Yeah, dad was-- he was a very active guy. He worked hard. You know, he was tall and he was strong. And then after his accident, he had-- he had a motorcycle accident and became quadriplegic. Had to take him to the hospital for observation. That changed the whole dynamic, you know, the whole family life because mum and dad were one year out of getting into this kind of retire and slow down. And then this big accident happens and it was tough. I was only twelve. Last year of school and I didn't really do so good and I didn't really care about it anymore. It was more, you know, thinking about other stuff with my dad and I had to-- I remember-- my brothers, older brothers had left school. So-- and my mum was six months of the year-- you know, for a long time, she was up in Melbourne with dad in the hospital, all the time. So it was just me and my little brother and sister at home. So, you know, sometimes I would just have to just focus on them. Just make their sandwiches, get to help them to school. And I think it just kind of makes you realize you gotta live every moment to the fullest, you know, because you never know what's gonna happen tomorrow. I didn't completely understand how vulnerable this human body can be. But yeah, it did kind of, you know, it definitely changed the dynamic and everything. It's actually very interesting that it made you appreciate life more. It didn't slow you down. If anything it just made me, well, realize that there'll be nothing I can do with-- really that I can do with him... anymore. It would've been cool to have a dad or a figure to, you know, like, I had my brother, which is good for me. It would be nice to maybe have someone older to really push me. I never got that but it did make me really focus on my bodybuilding and training, going to the gym. Kind of took out a lot of my focus and just put into weights, building myself up and, yeah, just not want to slow down. And just appreciate each day I've got that I can walk. What's up everyone? I'm back in Anglesea, in my backyard actually sitting right in front of this bird aviary I built with my dad like fifteen years ago or something. It's been hard to stay motivated sometimes. I haven't been going to the gym that much. And it's very hard for someone like me, who's impatient, always moving, always active. It's gonna be good to go home and see my family and stuff and be with them. And, you know, kind of just relax a bit like use this time to catch up with mates, like good friends. I haven't seen them for years and stuff. Don't look forward to going back to L.A. sometimes cause just, you know, it's different. It's just always-- it's just different. Yeah, home is home. Yeah, but I'll tell you something else really random, like, no shit, I've had, like, recurring dreams, like, at night. And a lot of times I end up dreaming about this place, right here. And yeah, I keep dreaming about this aviary and how I fixed it up and I put an extension on it or I put an extension. For some reason I just have this dream about this aviary a lot. That I've, like, built it out, got all my birds back and stuff, 'cause I used to keep birds when I was a kid. A lot of finches, doves, quail, that sort of stuff. I used to breed them in there. Um, but yeah. Seriously, fuck off! Yes, so anyway, that's why I just have him. All right. I'm out. Catch ya. Hey what's up everybody? It's day one for our rehab. First day in rehab so I'm going to go in and check in and see what the routine is for me to start. Social media, how do I feel about it? I mean, I'm kind of tired of it in a sense. Look at the scar. It's not bad. It's pretty clean. At least it's closed up now. Yeah, that's pretty solid. You can compare. You know, I felt pressure. Everyone was expecting you to look a certain way. Everyone is used to seeing you a certain way. Used to seeing your muscles or this and that. You feel that pressure and then you're concerned, you're worried and you're like, I literally-- I cannot please everyone, if I wanted to. You could have easily gotten depressed and like-- like, you know, really go. Yeah, I think so. You know, no, you know what? I put-- moments in time when I probably was depressed. Maybe I didn't know it. Maybe I did know it, but I sure as hell was not happy. Seriously, so stressful. Probably another forty minutes here and then I'll be good to go train, but until then... - Yeah, no, no, yeah. - Yeah, no. Yeah, no, no. So much for our handsome bodies. Here's some protein and some creatine. Creatine cockroaches. I guess I figured that, you know, I'm gonna be at home a lot and by myself a lot. So, I want to have some company. I like living by myself and everything, but I like animals, too. So why not get a dog that I can raise like a son? Like a child of my own and teach him the rascal ways. I think I really want one of these ones because I think they're better breed. Even a bit better to look after. They've got their papers. And I think I'm going to get this little fella. I first told him no. I was like you do a lot of traveling, so it's gonna be very difficult. I was like, it's not the best idea, but... just knowing that he was gonna spend a lot more time at home and recover. Then he's like, you know, I kind of want someone, I kind of want a dog. I was like, well, yeah, I guess that'll be a good idea if you want. My first pig dog. Just had to do it. Sometimes you just know, you know you're going to get them. We're going to get some supplies for the little mini bull terrier. You got a name for him yet? Ghost or... What about Boy? Just call him Boy. - Just Boy? - Here, Boy! See you're down to the one crutch now too? Yeah, it's just kind of a bit easy. - One crutch life? - One crutch life. So what do you want to start with first? You got some dog bowls right there. Oh that will do. You coming, Rex? Ready to go to the vet to get your shots? I'm not so sure if he's ready for this. Huh, little does he know. He's so excited. I think he's excited with all the smells and all the little dogs walking around. The noises. Buddy, you're just living the dream man? Oh sure. Right now, you know, with my injury and stuff, I can't really focus that much on my bodybuilding. So I can't do these full-throttle workouts. So, in the meantime, while I've got this downtime with my training, I can, you know, get a dog and just be at home 24/7, and train him up so that when I'm good, you know, within a year, me and him will be back on track. So he ended up getting Rex which has been one of the happiest things he's ever done. He loves his dog. He'll go on hikes with him to clear his mind. Usually when he wants to kind of de-stress, he'll just go to the mountains with his dog and go hiking. And just kind of cut everything off, cut-- turn his phone off and just go on a hike and enjoy walks with his dog. And Rex has been... been really good. In a lot of ways it stopped me thinking about myself, my problems. It stopped me thinking about, you know, negative thoughts or whatever because it is a puppy. You have to attend to him 24/7. So I'm thinking about him. Oh, he shit on the carpet. Oh he's pissed there. I gotta feed him. So all my problems went out the door and now I'm focused on the puppy dog. So it took away a lot of my depression, my anxiety or whatever the heck I was feeling, sadness. And now, it's, like, okay, I can't do what I'm used to doing all the time. I focus on my recovery, my physical therapy. You know, I dedicate myself to that very seriously. But in the other times, I'm making time for friends, for family, for business, for work, for future endeavors, for Rex. You're still mad? I can hold. Ready? Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, hold it, three, two... There we go. There I go to physical therapy five times a week. - We're going to go for seven minutes. - Okay. Only for the last three months, I was on this bike doing this. And all I could do was just this calf movements like this. And then go back and just push, push, push, push. Push, push, push. And only last week I managed to get a full revolution. It's a five-hour day. It takes me an hour to get down there and go to the clinic. Man, it now feels like I'm going to school or work. It's-- I know everyone there, so it's uh, it's like I look forward to it. Even though it hurts like hell. Three, two and... That's the worst I've ever done. Let's see, what you got yourself. I'll see if I'll add a little extra. Oh yeah, it's sore. Yeah. Come on. - Come on. Come on. - That's it. - Did you get it? - Ninety-four is your highest... It's a long process because I'm going from a straight leg zero degrees range of motion and the goal is to get it back to like, 130, 135 degrees, wherever my other leg is at. Every single session that I go to it's just about bending and bending it, trying to break through scar tissue. So it's working on getting the range of motion back but as they get more range then my quads get tighter. I get more swelling, inflammation, and pain. So it's like the-- it's almost like going to the gym. You break the muscles and you have to let it heal again. Go to physical therapy you, you get this progress, it's sore, it's painful, it's inflamed, they have to let it heal and then get some more progress. It's very slow. And it might be one or two degrees. Every time I went one degree up, more range of motion, then I get excited. It was difficult to start because I-- I had a-- I still have a blood clot. It was a restriction for my physical therapy with blood flow restriction and a few other techniques. So I've been on blood thinners so that that clot could clear up and I could do the exercises that were needed. But I think my real-- my main focus is just to be able-- I just want to be able to do normal things. Like be able to run, or ride a bike, or swim. I really want those capabilities back. See ya. Have a good weekend. See you, Monday. - You be careful. - I will. Thank you. It wasn't until I was... Teens, like, around fourteen maybe. Like thirteen, fourteen that I would have first discovered, kind of, bodybuilding. It wasn't body-- It was just go to the gym, grow muscles. We didn't even really think of bodybuilding as a-- didn't really know what it was called. I was just trying to get muscles. Come on. Okay. The gym I went to was down this-- down the hill from my home. This little garage shed that we trained at. And it was just storing, kind of, old dumbbells, barbells, all iron. No, not really many machines, a lot of free weights and we had to, like, do this key run. We would have to run down the hill, over the bridge, down to Turtle's house, grab the key out of his mailbox, go all the way back, unlock it, and then, yeah, do our workout. So my older brother, he was always stronger. I always wanted to like, you know, catch up to him. He was... he was a good fighter. Put on muscle really easily. It was, like, good competition. We would train together, stuff like that, and we'd go to the gym a lot at the start, so... I was always kind of trying to close the gap between me and Alex, my older brother. And I was always trying to create a gap between me and my little brother Eddie. I was always like run, chase, run, chase. We would just be ourselves. There'd be maybe one or two other people sometimes, but really, it was just us. Yeah, I like that one better. Come on. Two, three, four. Pump it up. Come on. Max bench press was thirty kilos. That was a form of 30-- and I remember the first time going up a little bit heavier doing 35 kilos or whatever it was. And then it was just gradual. You know, over that year made a lot of gains. Eventually, I think before they closed that place down, I think I got like, 90 kilos or 100 kilos, 220 pounds almost. And I was young, maybe sixteen or something. - What's the last name? - Von Moger. - First name? - Calum. This is for pre-op. I have another surgery for my bicep. - When is your surgery for this? - We haven't decided yet. - Maybe next week hopefully. - Okay. This was the last surgery that I had to do that I was very impatient to get done because it was-- okay I have to get this done and then I can finally start working on everything and coming back again. Because at the... before that I could do some training but I couldn't do 100 percent because I still needed this bicep reattached. I could work through it, but eventually I'd have to get the surgery. Come on, Rex. I was doing a little of the resistance training. I think I just pulled a little bit. I bruised up and I just stopped. Stopped training. That was like four weeks ago. Now are you, kind of, thinking as far as surgery, a specific date you want to get it done? Kind of, I was looking at, like next week even, if possible. The reason I waited was because I didn't want to have done my bicep surgery at the same time as a quad surgery because then I would be stuck in a wheelchair or something. I couldn't use crutches. And I'd be completely dependable on someone else. And I didn't want that. I would have to have a carer or someone. And I like-- I like my own time. All right, so cool. Thanks very much, Mark. Appreciate that. Come on out. We'll get you all set. Hey, buddy, where's your leash? Let's go get sorted. Hey, Cal, good news. We finalized an arrangement with the SN Pro. The SN Pro is looking to host you in Moscow and it looks like, you know, they're going to be sending over a schedule with several press opportunities. So we're very excited for that. ♪ ♪ I was in Russia. I had an expert in Moscow and my manager and I was in an interview and he got a call and my friend who was house-watching, he-- he was on the phone. He said they're gonna evacuate your home. I've, you know, in 30 minutes. We've gotta go now. What should I grab? I didn't know what was going on. Breaking news tonight. California in flames. Raging infernos exploding from north to south. People found dead in their cars on roads cut-off at a massive struggle to escape. I said get Baz, my frilled neck lizard, and get out of there. My dog Rex is already with-- with a dog carer, a sitter. So he's all right. Yeah, that's all I thought about was like just my animals and yourself, get out of there. And to hope for the-- you know, pray for the best that nothing burned down. That was a pretty-- pretty big scare. Very luckily, my house was all right. And the fires came right up to the back of the fences, even like, blowing over into the backyard. But the wind changed or it just went out and then kind of headed in the Malibu direction. But there's a lot of destruction, a lot of devastation. You know, it's so much damage everywhere. The firefighters like, God bless them, and all the support crews and everyone that's, you know, put their hands down to help out. It's pretty-- pretty rough, pretty hectic out here and very hard with traffic and traveling and a lot of-- still we can't get into the-- into Malibu or anything. It's all on lock-down. All the roads are still closed. There's power lines over the roads, probably destruction, cars, burned out cars and things like that. Anyway can't get that stuff and some-- some food out. Hopefully, help the animals. Do you wanna eat some? And then we can just grab one biscuit like this. Bail there. So, yeah, we're gonna just leave it there for now. I put some seed down for the-- on the ground for the ground squirrels and stuff like that. And I'm just gonna put some hay under those trees over there later. So at least, you know what, they might not find it for a while. I don't know, they're probably long gone. But if they do happen to be in the area, at least there's some food for them. It's the least I could do. Give them some water, you know. The creek was dry. You saw it. It's all dead. There's no-- no green, there's no food anywhere. I'm out of puff. I can't do much with a busted leg and a busted arm, but there'll be animals all over the place, struggling. So if you live in an area like this, go grab some hay and feed them. Hey what's up? Hey, Calum, how are you, man? Hang on one second, let me just record this. Oh, shit. - I'm good, what's going on? - Good. Good. I sent you over the schedule for the Bigger premiere. I just wanted to make sure you got it. Oh yeah, yeah. I got the e-mail. I've got a suit for the red carpet appearance. - And then just, like, kind of... - Perfect, perfect. ...casual, smart casual for the other one's is fine? I think, you know, a nice dark suit with a white shirt will be more than appropriate. And you'll be flying in with Steve Jones. Steve already sent the itinerary and I forwarded it over to you. So you got it. Yeah, awesome. Sweet. Sounds good. I'm excited. Yeah, I'll see you in Vegas. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Thanks for tuning in guys, you're listening to 91.5 Jazz and More on the Rebel HT2. This morning we are joined by some special guests. The gentleman behind the story of Arnold Schwarzenegger and the Weider Brothers discovering him. This is the movie called Bigger. The fitness industry has grown in leaps and bounds and it's become pervasive, especially with young people. And I thought it was important for those people to know who created this thing. It was amazing because I looked up to Arnold for a long time. And for me to play him in a movie was... it's almost like a dream come true because he had lived the life that I was going after. You know, that I am going-- you know, with bodybuilding and all these sort of things, so to play the role kind of came naturally to me. When we first developed the script, our concern was that if we didn't have someone that looked like Arnold and sound like Arnold and built like Arnold, it would just really turn people off. And it would look really hokey. You, obviously, deliver in spades by given your physique and your acting abilities. And you happen to look-- you have a very similar facial structure. But even that, you-- you have a sense of charm about you that Arnold has... - Yeah. - ...and without that charm, It would never have worked. You know, it was nice to see it come to life and made it even twice as good having my family, all my brothers and friends with me and experience that. I think this will be one moment that will kind of set in motion more moments like that to come perhaps, you know. Hello Arnold, my name is Joe Weider. I know. I read the books. Yes, those are my magazines. - IFBB. - That is my federation. I have seen your picture. And I have pictures of you. Come look. I do want to get my muscles back, I do. I miss them. I still want to get back up to at least 230, 235, cause that weight feels... I feel good at that weight. But I'm very patient now. I've built up a lot of patience letting and listening to my physical therapist and the time frames of letting the muscles heal and when I can start actually training them. I'm not gonna feel sorry for myself. I'm not gonna blame anyone except myself. I'm not gonna let this break me. I'm gonna build myself back up from here and show that, you know, I can have a huge setback. I can be thrown down the bottom of the pit and I can climb back up. So, I had to. I completely let go of the fact that, you know, bodybuilding is now. I have to take a step back. This whole rest of the year, no bodybuilding, and in a way, it's a blessing because it took me away from this-- this other little bubble that I was in. The fitness industry and this competing and stuff and, you know, I guess when that's all taken away and you can't do it, you start to see that it's not the end of the world. Hey, Doctor Banffy. Hey. How you doing? It's Calum. Yeah, I just got your missed call and I just wanted to ask you if it was gonna be fine for me to start training again. I'm feeling a lot better. Yeah, not too hard. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just, like, 50 percent. Okay. ♪ ♪ So I'm in here in Sicily, shooting for Gucci for a week.
