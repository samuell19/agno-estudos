NARRATOR: Straight out of today's headlines comes a movie bigger than the 10 commandments. An inspiring movie of biblical proportions. 44 1936. Preacher man, his silver tongue manipulates the masses. Because you're the devil's prisoner. He's sitting inside you laughing and you don't even know it. Yes, he's a cancer eating away. And, Lord, better call him out. NARRATOR: His preaching fills his pockets with gold. You see the devil created money and now the good Lord wishes you to reach down deep and get rid of it. [SIRENS WAILING] NARRATOR: He gives new meaning to fatherly love. Don't tell a soul. He came right on time. NARRATOR: Preacherman. He is the man of the club who performs miracles between the sheets. When he hears confessions of sexual sin it raises more than his spiritual awareness. Preacher man, he's a hard driving, smooth talking, two fisted fighting, law breaking pastor of disaster. He's a man of action, a man of peace, a man of passion, and a moving target. [GUN SHOTS] And then you can tell that old devil to go to to Hell. NARRATOR: Preacher man, he preaches the gospel of deception to gain a young girls reception. When the rubber meets the road the pistol pumping, tire screeching, gear turning preacher is always a step ahead of the law while staying in step with the ladies. When he comforts your daughters they haven't got a prayer. Preacher man will hit your tight below the Bible Belt. [ROOSTER CROWING] [FARM NOISES] SISTER BERTHA: What you gonna do now? AMOS: Just hold on tight, honey child. SISTER BERTHA: Oh, my. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS] [ENGINE REVVING] [KNOCK ON DOOR] I seen him, sheriff. I seen him. Where? Up in Jeff Row Clemon's hayloft. Who was the gal? Well? It was Bertha. What's the matter? Why'd you stop? I gotta be running along, sweet thing. So like I done told you, don't tell a soul, because that would be wrong. And you wouldn't want to do anything wrong now would you, sister? Can't you stay a little longer, Reverend? Sister Bertha, the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. God bless you, sister. THEME SONG: Amos Huxley was supposed to be a man of God against sin. He could preach the fire's of Hell so hot no man would thing he had sin. But a hunger for women and a love for money made him a wanted man. They put his face on posters in the two Carolina's and down in the Georgia land. You better run preacher man. You better run for you life. The sheriff's got a gun and the sheriff's got blood in his eyes. You took his young daughter and you preached the congregation of men. You better run, preacher man, or the sheriff's going to do you in. You better run, preacher man, or the sheriff's going to do you in. [ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING] [CHURCH BELL RINGING] Thank you so much for coming, sister. Thank you, brother. What a lovely dress you have on today, sister. Nice to see you again. Preacher. Boy, I want to-- I want to see you-- see more of you, you hear? I haven't seen you for six months. You watch yourself. Come on now. Nice to see you. Nice to see you. Thank you. Thank you. Reverend? Howdy, deputy. Reverend Huxley, circuit Preacher? That's right. So you fellas catch up with those two boys that run up on the chain gang? --Well not yet, but there ain't going to be anybody in or out of this county. We've set up road blocks and we've got it closed tight as a drum. That's fine. Fine. Real fine. Reverend? Sheriff wants to have a word with you. Yeah. It's always a pleasure to welcome a man of the law to the house of the Lord. What can I do for you, sheriff? Is this the man? Yes. I do declare, if that ain't sister Bertha sitting there, and all teared up. Are you all right, sister? We missed your sweet singing at the meeting this morning. You didn't go and do anything wrong now did you sister? No, Reverend, you did. You see this girl here is the sheriff's daughter. Oh, Lord. Now get in the car. THEME SONG: Now the preacher's going to jail and the sins of man is plain for all to see that his mind wasn't on the ways of the world, but on the sheriff's daughter's knee. And if you look real close you can hear him sigh from the thoughts that were in his mind. He was self-ordained as a preacher man but he wasn't the believing kind. You better run, preacher man. You better run for your life. The sheriff's got a gun and the sheriff's got blood in his eyes. You took his young daughter and you preached the congregation of men. You better run, preacher man, or the sheriff's going to do you in. If I ever catch you in this county again I'll personally hit you in the eye. I'll smash you in the ear. I'll kick you in the mouth. And I'll push your nose to the back of your head. In other words, I'll close everything that's open and open everything that's closed. Here's something to remind you. Leon! [GRUNTS] [ENGINE FALTERING] [BANGING] [ENGINE STARTING] [HORN HONKING] Mary Lou? [HORN HONKING] Mary Lou? [HORN HONKING] What you want, papa? I'm going into Roundrob be back by nightfall.

Why don't you come inside? Not that way you sillies. Come on in the front way. [MOANING] CLYDE: My, oh my. Ain't you something? [LAUGHTER] How many? [SNEEZING] Here this will straighten you up. My, my. Ain't that something? Shut up, Billy Joe. Give me four. [MOANING] CLYDE: Oh, Mary Lou. Oh, Mary Lou, you're so pretty. I'm out. MARY LOU: Oh! [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Ain't you through yet, Clyde? No, damn it, now stop bothering me, ya hear? Clyde, you've been in there over an hour. You're going to have her plumb tuckered out before I get to her. Not Mary Lou. Boy, she's something else. You're disgusting. You know that, Billy Joe? I think maybe you're some kind of a pervert or something. You watch your mouth, boy. Yeah, boy. You want to make something out of it, huh? Is that what you want? Oh. Clyde! come here quick, huh? Clyde, we got to get. I told you to stop bothering me, Marvin and I meant what I said. Clyde, look. JUDD: Mary Lou? Mary Lou? It's your old man. He's back. [SCREAMING] Oh! Through here! What's the matter with you? Hi, papa. You're back early. I didn't expect you until tonight. When I call at you you answer, girl. You deep or something. Now get your fanny out here and give me a hand. Well sure, papa. I just didn't here you come up. I was laying in bed. [SNEEZING] God bless you. Why you little hussy. [SCREAMING] [GUN SHOTS] Ah! Reverend? I must be dead. And you must be one of the good Lord's angel's. Hardly. Well where am I? What is-- what is this place? I'm Judd Crabtree. This here is my little girl, Mary Lou. We found you down the road in a heap. Who done you in, Reverend? Uh, I reckon it was those two convicts I happened to light upon. I reached out the Lord's hand and they fell on it. Why if I were there I would have scratched out their eyes. To do such a thing to such a fine looking man. My what a sweet thing. [LAUGHING] Yes, sir. Good. That's real good. I wish there was some way to return all this Christian kindness with a little deed of my own. A little bit more of that fine coffee please, ma'am. Sure. Hell, preacher, there is. There's a meaningful thing that only you can do. Hmm? Listen here, brother. Mary Lou's mother died in childbirth. And as she was dying she made me promise to baptize the girl. She ain't been baptized. Would you please pass those collards? Thank you. Since my Sarah's death, well I've been a lost man. Maybe that's the reason Mary Lou's the way she is. Hmm. Could I have just a little bit more of that corn you've got over there? Thank you. Now her mama was good, a good women, sang and played the piano. Well Mary Lou looks mighty good to me my, mighty good. So do them biscuits. JUDD: I believe the devil's lied deep in her because I never got her baptized. Preacher, did you know she's got an unnatural hankering for men folk? Does she now? Well I hadn't noticed. What have you got to say for yourself, Mary Lou? Why-- why-- why every time a man just touches me I go all gooey inside. Yeah? And then I-- I mean he and I-- There's no need to describe everything. It is important that she confesses the whole of her sins. Now you go right on, little one. Well, Reverend, it's like this. Mm-hmm. Most girls like one boy. Yeah? Others have more. Two and three and-- Yeah. --four. Like that Clyde Massingale and Marvin-- Well it's clear as day what's needed here is a baptism. JUDD: Thank the Lord. Yeah. [HORN HONKING] Howdy, Judd. Mary Lou. Oh, you too, preacher. Martha we is busy. Can't you see? Judd, I got this new ointment for your leg. If you use it everyday it won't cramp up on you no more. Now Martha we is busy. Oh, yeah. I come by this here nice tie. I want you to have it. I don't need-- It won't cost you anything. It's a gift. Take it. Martha, now there's nothing that we need from the truck today. And, besides, Mary Lou and the Preacher and myself, we is got business. A marrying? No, Martha, not a marrying. Well I could do the singing. I've got a powerful singing voice, preacher. And so has my brother, Henry. I've been told together we can make a stone cry. Is that so? Martha Applebee, preacher, pleased to me you. It's a pleasure to meet you, sister. Why what happened to your head? Oh nothing just a little-- Oh, well here let me take a look at that. Martha, me and the preacher-- Are you coming our way to preach? No, as a matter of fact, sister, I was just leaving. Roadblocks still up, both ends of White Oak County. No one can go in and out without first being checked. Even me. Must be looking for those escapes. They is the ones who whooped up on the preacher man. Don't say? -Do say? -White Oak? We're still in White Oak? Yep, picked you up in Orange and brung you back to White Oak. Is something wrong, preacher. My head, things are beginning to spin all about me. Yes, that blow must have been harder than I figured. Oh, Reverend, sit yourself down. Yes. Yes, thank you. I think I will. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Wow I guess I'll be having to call on your hospitality a little bit more than I had planned. Well that'll be an honor, Reverend. Sure enough. The good Lord sure moves in strange way, does he not? And I hear him a-calling me to perform a baptism? Thank the Lord. When? When preacher? First thing in the morning. The devil must be washed away from this pour, unfortunate creatures sole before any time elapses. Well there's this little old water hole where I-- I swim alone sometimes. Yeah, I think that the little old place that the good lord had in mind. Preacher, can I bring my brother, Henry? Why sure, sister Martha, sure. Thank you, Preacher. Henry just loves baptisms. That's good. MARTHA AND HENRY: (SINGING) On the banks of your sweet river we sing our praise to thee. And ask our Lord to give this soul the light of God to see. We need the hand of God to wash away our sins. Savior, open up your arm let a sinner's soul come in. Let a sinner's soul come in. We ask, oh Lord, today. Let the waters of the Lord wash all our sins away. Let the light of God shine through so we can see our sins. Savior open up your arms. Let a sinner's and soul come in. AMOS: I baptize thee, Mary Lou Crabtree, in the name of the good Lord that put us down on this here Earth. Lord, this sweet young thing, who has been put in one of the finest bodies you have ever built, didn't know right from wrong when she got all messed up with them boys. Her soul said, no. No. But her body said go. Lord, the old man and I would be beholden to you if you wash away all them bad thing she done did and take her back to the fold. Amen. And Adam said, this is now bone of my bones, flesh of my flesh. And she shall be called women. Because she was taken out of man. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife. And they shall be one flesh. And they were both naked, the man and his wife. And were not ashamed. Amen. Reverend? Yes, little one? I got the funniest kind of feeling all inside my body when you done baptized me. What kind of a feeling, little one? I don't know. I just tingle from the bottom of my toes to the top of my head. I ain't never felt like that before. Never ever. Not even with them boys. I once knew a sweet young thing just like yourself. She'd tingle inside like her inside's were upside down. Yea, that's just like I feel. And I'd say, you're ripe and ready to do the Lord's work, Mary Lou. Because that's what that little girl went and done. And you know something? She did real well. Oh, my. She was one of the chosen and didn't even know it. Do you think that I might be one of the chosen, too? Well I can't rightly tell, but we could check. Why don't you turn around, honey. Yeah, turn around. Let me show you. This won't hurt. There. Now relax. OK. Yeah. How you feel now? I just am aching all over now. [LAUGHTER] There. Ooh-hoo. Would you like to work for the Lord, Mary-Lou? I don't rightly know. You know, I can just see you now dressed in a long, white robe that reaches to the floor with big angel sleeves that when you raise your arms to the sky you look just like an angel of the Lord. Oh. I ain't never seen a dress like that before. Preacher? I just got this aching inside of me I want to do the Lord's work. Could I? Could I? Yes. Preacher? Is my sweet, little thing really fit to do the Lord's work? That's a good question, old man. No, no she ain't fit yet. Not until after the visitation. Visitation? What's a visitation, Reverend? Well that's when someone comes a calling. Who's going to come a calling? Well the angel Leroy. Angel Leroy? I don't think I done ever heard of the Angel Leroy. Well few people have, you see, he only comes to those young, sweet things that are ripe and ready to do the Lord's work. When does he come? Oh, around midnight. Stays two hours, sometimes three. In your case I'd say three. What does my sweet, little girl got to do to get the visitation from angel Leroy? Well first of all she's going to have to want Leroy to come. Oh, I do. I do. I really-- I truly do. And then the next thing, you have to go to your room and you burn this sweet smelling powder. And then you take this candle, you light it and place it buy the window. Take off all worldly clothing and jump in the bed in your birthday suit. Just like the good Lord put you down on this here Earth. Then you drink this special angel potion. Now it's going to burn at first but don't worry because the more it burns the better the visitation is going to be. But don't drink it all. Save a few swigs for Leroy. Why? Do he drink the potion too? Never question the habits of angel's child. That's the first rule and don't you forget it. You do like angel Leroy says, as you hear girl? Oh, Lord. First a man of the Lord in our little house and tonight the visitation of the angel Leroy. Amen. Now I can't promise you anything, old man. He may come and he may not. He may not be able to find this God forsaken place that's so out of the way. What can I do? I do want my little girl to have her chance. Well there is a way to guarantee the visitation. Have you got a ladder? A tall ladder? Yes, sir. Good. You take this lamp, and you get that ladder. And you go to your room and place that in the window. And you drink that potion. And you get with it because we ain't got much time, right? Now let's get with it. JUDD: Leroy? Leroy? Leroy? Leroy? Leroy? Leroy? Leroy? Leroy? Leroy? Leroy? Leroy? Leroy? Leroy? Leroy? Leroy? Are you the angel Leroy? Yes. Yeah? What do you want me to do now? Move over. JUDD: Leroy? Leroy? Leroy? MARY LOU: (SINGING) I've been saved by the Preacher man. Hallelujah, I've been saved. No more doing wrong for right. No more sneaking out at night. I'm going to do all the good I can. I've been touched by the preacher's hand. Hallelujah, I've been saved by the preacher man. Morning, papa. Tell me, child. Did the angel Leroy come? Papa, he came right on time. And he left at sunrise. thank you so much, papa. Lordy me. SHERIFF: That's what I should have done to the son of a bitch. Well now, Sheriff, you know this man's not wanted for murder. SHERIFF: Same thing. No, I'm afraid not. What he's wanted for is extortion, fraud, and statutory rape. What kind of rape is that? Never you mind, Leon. He sure gets around, don't he? You might say that. This fella down in Georgia well he put up $500 in reward money for him. Must have wanted him real bad. Where the story goes, he couldn't have proper relations with his wife no more. [LAUGHTER] So he confesses this to the Preacher man who promptly sends him off on some holy pilgrimage. Well when he returns home, he find both his wife, and his 16-year-old daughter, mighty pregnant. Son-of-a-bitch, and I had him right here. Sheriff, how about you and your deputy be on close look out for him just in case he happens to show up around these parts again, will you? No chance. He's got to be miles from here. MARY LOU: You always been a Preacher? No, Mary-Lou, there was another time. What did you do before? I traveled about with the carnival. [LAUGHTER] Oh, golly. I'd sure like to travel about myself. You will when you're ready. When did you leave the carnival? The day a friend of mine died. After that well things just weren't the same anymore. I know what you mean. I had myself this little black and white kitten that went and died on me. And I was sick for days. JUDD: Mary Lou? Mary Lou? Oh, what you want, papa? JUDD: Get your fanny in here. It's time to go to bed. He's always yelling at me. If he had himself a woman he wouldn't be bothering me so much. Well it appears to me Martha would be more than ready to tie the knot. Sure enough. Only Papa don't see her like no woman. The man is blind. JUDD: Mary Lou? Mary Lou? Oh, come on, Papa. Well goodnight, preacher. Goodnight, Mary-Lou. [MUSIC PLAYING] MAN: (SINGING) There was another time, another place, another world. There was another night, another kiss, another girl. And every time I think about that other place, that other love it's then I long to be in that other time, in that other, other world. In that other time, in that other, other world. 40-acres. AMOS: You know there was a time when I would have given anything for 40 acres. JUDD: All of it tillable, yes sir. Trouble is I haven't done a thing with it since my Sarah's done die, not a blasted thing. Waste of the good Lord's Earth. Just didn't feel like growing nothing no more. Lord is shaking his fist at you, Judd. I know it. I know it. And I feel it. And he has a right to do it, but that's going to change, Preacher. I'm going to change. Amen, Judd. This here is going to be the best run piece of land in these here parts. Amen, brother. Only well it-- Let's here it. What is it? There's something that's been bothering me. Something I've been keeping inside, locked up from you. And I got to pull it from my conscience before I can make any changes. Well what is it? I mean, don't let it stay there. Don't let it fester like a bad wound. A still? JUDD: A still. My way, preacher. My poor way of taking care of Mary-Lou and myself. Lord. JUDD: I know it's a sin, Lordy. A still. JUDD: Have pity on a poor sinner. Oh, Lord. JUDD: I beg forgiveness, I do. Please understand the feelings of a man who just lost his wife. A good wife who could sing and play the piano. Fact is it wasn't my idea at all. It was the sheriff who set me up. The sheriff? JUDD: I sale to the Sheriff and he sells to his brother-in-law who runs a general store. Lord. JUDD: S Good man Preacher, a pious man. Oh, really? JUDD: You'll meet him once. Oh, really? He come up here often? JUDD: Hardly much. Yeah, that's good. What's good? Oh, it's a good and lucky thing the Lord hasn't seen fit to work his anger on you, the Sheriff, and his brother-in-law. That's what's good. JUDD: Sure is. Sure is. I must have been protected by some good angel. Well I ain't taken no more chances. Hold on, brother. Hold on. Didn't you know that the devil's tonic can become God's eye water? Why, no. No, I didn't know that. Well it's true. This still right where it's standing, brother, can become the foundation of a church of God. It could? That's true. That's true. You see what we do is we continue to sell the corn liquor as always. But this time we cut out the Sheriff and his brother-in-law. As a matter of fact, we send Martha and Henry from house to house. Martha? Yes, every man, woman, and child in this county will become part of this great drama. The building of a church right here in this hallowed ground. Martha will go up from farm to farm, from shack to shack, and the Lord will be on the truck with her. Amen. (SINGING): I'm going to meet my savior up there when I die. When I die. Ain't going to hang-- Yeah, and the money is going to come in until our pockets will fill up. And then, oh man, we're going to go out. We're going to buy some nails, and some lumber. And buy everything that's necessary to build a house of the Lord. And then, old man, think in that house all the souls that I'll be able to save. And you-- you-- you, old man, because the Lord has been with you-- the Lord has inspired you. You will be coming our deacon, first officer, first officer of his house. Second in command. Amen. Yeah. THEME SONG: Making moonshine whiskey was a way to make money and Amos didn't pass it up. He had a ready-made still and help to run it. And a chance to make a few fast bucks. Along with the still came Mary Lou and the preacher man smiled inside for the still meant money, Mary Lou meant love, and he'd sure take her for a ride. And he'd sure take her for a ride. (SINGING): I'M going to meet my Savior up there when I die. JUDD: Leroy (SINGING): Ain't going to hang my head in shame and start to cry. JUDD: Leroy? (SINGING): Going to get down on bended knees, thank the Lord and say and please. I'm going to meet my Savior up there when I die. JUDD: Leroy? CLYDE: Mary Lou? Mary Lou? I'll teach those tomcats to come whining around here once and for-- No, papa, let me. Clyde? [BOING] MARY LOU: Marvin? [BOING] MARY LOU: Jimmy? [BOING] MARRY Lou: Billy Joe? [BOING] MARY LOU: Now you boys listen to me real good. I told you I don't want you calling on me no more. I done been baptized, had the visitation of the angel Leroy, and I got myself religion, and all. Do you know anybody named Leroy? I've never known him. Ain't no Leroy around here. You heard a man named Leroy? No. No. No. Who in the Hell's Leroy? Leroy is a religious experience. And let me tell you, even though he's just an angel, boy hes better than the whole bunch of you put together. So get. I'm going to tell my pappy to start shooting at you. Amen. What the hell's going on? I know. Come on. [MUSIC - "I'M GOING TO MEET MY SAVIOR] I'm going to meet my savior up there when I die. Ain't going to hang my head in shame and start to cry. Going to get down on bended knees, thank the Lord and say I'm pleased. I'm going to meet my savior up there when I die.

Now, brother Judd, you know what we need around here? We need some help to spell you a bit.

Ain't nobody around these parts a looking for work. Here they don't come to it, or they've got too much. Unless maybe old Farley. Who's Farley? Has a neighboring piece of land. Raises chickens. Farley's a strange one, he is. Yeah, look, we need nobody running around here, coming in and out of work. We need somebody that's going to stay around the clock. None of this 5 o'clock business and then running to your wife. Farley ain't got no wife. Well then running to his women, or to his mama. He ain't got no mama nor a women. He ain't got a wife, a mama, or a woman? Well what's he got? Chickens. Chickens? Chickens. I told you, Farley is a strange one. Saddam and Gomorrah. [CHICKENS CLUCKING] AMOS: Lord.

Amen. I seen everybody working here, happy and all, and I figured this must be a good thing what you're all doing. None your business what we're doing, Clyde. Brother Crabtree, the boys repentant. And a repentant sinner is the Lord's most cherished child. Long as I don't have to cherish him. Is that true, Clyde? It sure is. Old man, it is my duty to save those souls that wants to be saved. Even those as mean and ornery as Clyde here. And there's no better way to root the devil out of a man, brother, than to put him to work. Why, Clyde here could go into town, pick up supplies. Yes, and do all the heavy lifting. Couldn't you, Clyde? Oh, I'll do anything to help. I want to be saved, preacher. Amen, brother. Anything you say, Reverend. But Clyde? Mary Lou's off limits. You hear that? You hear it boy? Fill her up. Afternoon, sister Martha. Howdy. We're doing better everyday, preacher.

Yeah, in old man Crabtree's truck, too. Right? He's supposed to hate that boy something fierce. He does. I hope nothing's happened to that old man that he's got to rely on that dimwit. Right? Say, maybe something has happened? The old man ain't been to town with a fresh supply in over two weeks now. That's a fact, Leon. My brother-in-law's been complaining about sell's being down. It all don't look too good, do it? You said a mouthful, Leon. Go get that boy. Clyde! Not that way, Leon. Go up to him, friendly like. SHERIFF: You were doing what for old man Crabtree? Buying up sugar for his still. SHERIFF: He got a still? Boy, don't you know that's illegal? Where is he selling the stuff? He don't directly. He gives it to Martha Applebee and she goes around-- did I say something wrong? No you didn't say nothing wrong, boy. Keep talking. They are calling it God's nectar. They say they've never been so busy making so much money. Well ain't that something. Well I guess I should be getting back now. Guess so, Clyde. Drop in anytime, Clyde. And Clyde? Don't say nothing to the old man about having a chat with me and Leon. What's the matter, Clyde? You seen that fella before? Why no, sheriff. No, I thought I did. Only it ain't the same feller. He resembles my uncle, Jedd. Well I hope your uncle Jedd ain't a bad one as that one is. You been standing there long, boy? Just come up. Just come up from town, in fact. Well that's just dandy. Old man Crabtree in the back working away, boy. You got some sugar for the still you better take it to him, hear? Yeah, it wasn't him I was looking for.

I want my Mary Lou back. You fascinated her from me with your sweet talking, and your angels, jewels and religious experiences. Clyde, are you jealous of God? Are you jealous of his hold on her sweet soul? Well I'm not so sure it's her sweet soul your after, mister Amos Huxley. Ain't no goodness in you is there Clyde? Pure devil. Well I will continue to pray for you. Clyde, get. [SCREAMING] Ow! Clyde! Are you crazy? You don't like living, or something? Oh! Oh! Now hold on, Mary Lou Hold on. I just don't want nobody to see us. Just let go of me. I couldn't hold it in no longer. Seeing you every day and not being able to talk to you, to touch you. I done told you, Clyde. I'm a changed women. Well I'm glad of that. What do you mean by that? I want you for myself, no sharing you with the whole county. Why, Clyde, do you mean that? I sure do. Always did. And it always burned my insides to see you with them others. Why don't you say so? Well I didn't know what kind of feelings you had towards me, in particular. They was always good ones. You should have known that. Oh, Mary Lou. Mary Lou, I want you to marry up with me. Oh, Clyde. Say you will, Mary Lou. And I'll show you what I can do for you. I'll get me a job, a real job this time. And I'll save up enough money to get us a small piece of property. And we'll have children. Clyde? Clyde? Me and the Preacher. Oh, I knew it. I knew it. You and the Preacher, what? Well I was thinking of joining him traveling and all. Did he ask you? Well he mentioned the likelihood that once I was pure enough I could travel with him and I could help him with his work? So he aim's on taking you away. Well he won't. I won't allow it. What are you talking about, Clyde? Mar Lou, the old preacher man ain't no real preacher. Clyde, you're going too far now. You ain't got no right to hurt the reputation of that fine man of God. But he ain't no man of God at all. You better watch what you're saying, Clyde. It's the truth. You're preacher man is a wanted man, a criminal. Clyde, You better to get out of her right now. And never show your face again because you ain't nothing but trash. Oh, it's the damn truth. Jealousy has done something to your brain, Clyde. Filled you with poisons. Mar Lou. Mary Lou, I love you. Oh, oh, oh, oh, ow! What did you do that for? I done told you, Clyde. Now you better get out of here like a flash. I ain't going to let him have you. I ain't going to let him ruin your life. I won't. [HORN HONKING] Martha? Judd? Now I'll declare. Things sure did change when that preacher man come, didn't they? MARTHA: They sure did. JUDD: You know, I'm even thinking about working the land, Martha. Going to buy this little old swimming hole for Mary Lou to swim around in. MARTHA: It's a mighty big piece of land for a man to work alone. JUDD: 40-acres, all tillable. MARTHA: Don't say? JUDD: Do say? MARTHA: How long you been living alone? JUDD: Too long. I declare, Mary-Lou. I don't see something happy on this land. Are you going to go? Going? Leaving us? Yes. Yes, I will after we get all the money-- um, for the church. Am I coming with you? You want to? Doing the Lord's work is the best thing I've ever done. I know that, honey. I know that. Tonight you're going to be our angel. [MUSIC PLAYING]: I'm going to meet my savior. I'll have a home where we will lie. I'll live in glory, me with my Savior. I'm going to change my way of life. Change your way of living. In your home up there on high. Well one of these days the Lord is coming there'll be no time to say goodbye. When I go to meet my Savior. I'll live in glory me with my Savior. I'm going to change my way of life. God bless you. My, what mighty handsome looking children. What are such fine upstanding people doing here, Lord? Is it because they know that they is miserable sinners and they come here to be saved? Is it because the Holy Spirit is a flying around inside them a forcing them to be saved? It is? They are? Well then I ain't leaving here until every man, woman, and child is saved. I can't. The Lord won't let me. He won't allow me to leave here till I finish up what he'd done sent me here to do. Now he sent me here because the people of this entire county have become children of the devil. He didn't have time to tell me why, but he did say you would know. Every one of you sitting out there would know. Every one of you painted women with your high skirts and fancy hats know you going to burn in the everlasting fires of hell. You don't talk about it. Ha ha, children of the devil don't tell a soul. They keep it all inside, secret like. All twisted, disjointed carbon crib confined, all locked in. And then one big, fat day they get the fear. The fear that the Lord is near. The fear you get when you know you're going to burn in that old Devil's Hole for eternity. Well tonight you can slip away. Tonight you got your chance to wash yourself of the sins you've been living with and feel clean all over. Tonight you got this chance to repent the years of fornicating, lying, drinking, cheating, and what have you. Tonight you've got your chance to throw yourself back into the arms of God and to become once again that children of the Lord. And then you can tell that old devil to go to Hell, back where he belongs. Yeah. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [BOINGING] CONGREGATION SINGING: Kneel in the light. He will save you if you kneel in the light. If you walk around in darkness and you're a sinner man. You'll fall to pieces. You'll have no place to stand. Let the Lord be your savior, let him be your guide. And he will always answer if you kneel in the light. Kneel, Kneel in the light. He will save you if you kneel in the light. Tonight around God and yourself, and keep that old devil away for good. Now what does it take to build a fortress? Anybody tell me? How about you? How about you, little one? Nobody? Well I'll tell you. It takes nothing. Nothing at all. You don't have to study hard, become a minister, anything difficult like that. All you gotta do is put up a place, right here, for him to rest. Now here's the thing, did you know that with the devil's food you can build God's house? Yeah, that's right. You see the devil created money and now the good lord wishes you to reach down deep and get over rid of it. Now you may say, well how far down must a man reach? How much should he give? And I say, when it hurts, when it stings, then you know that old devil is on the run. Then you know, brothers and sisters, that you've been saved. Because that old devil just can't take cotton to see the house of the lord built. That's something he just won't do. Mary Lou? Don't she look pretty, everybody? In her new angel gown? Mary Lou is going to pass amongst you with the Lord's bucket for an offering. Mary Lou has been saved and the good lord knows she's been saved, is going to pass amongst you for a generous offer. So in the morning you can see a foundation being poured right here. Not just any foundation, not just any house, not just any country store, not just any jail, but the foundation of the chambers of the lord. A place for him to rest whenever he feels like. Get up the next morning, tidy up a bit, before he goes on to his resting. I hear too much clanging in the bucket. I hear too much clanging in the bucket. I want to hear the rustling sound of that soft green stuff. Yeah, that's a little better, brother. Little better. Yeah. Brothers and sisters? Brothers and sisters? This is a test. This is a test to see the devil's amongst you. Now he's there. Depend on it. He's sitting on your wallets. He's sitting on your purses. Not letting you open yourself up to the lord. Oh, God see's sin here. He see's everybody's lust. Your lust, your lust. Your-- no, your lust, too. No, don't go looking at your neighbor, sister. I mean you. And you knows I mean you. I can see deep inside and I'll be damned if I don't see the devil. And I aim to pull him out of you. [SIRENS WAILING] I got a story, a true story. A story about a woman, a young woman, a married woman. Married to a man of standard, a man of the fields. A farmer who wouldn't stop stooping and bending because he loved God's Earth. A man at one with the Lord. His trouble were he weren't no handsome devil. How many of us is, I ask you, huh? Well anyway, this woman she needed this, you see, and it bothered her some. Yeah, that old devil was biting at her neck, making her dissatisfied with one of God's chosen children. Biting and gnawing. The farm needed another hand, a drifter appeared. A tall, handsome devil, strong like an ox with eyes that dug deep into a man. Demanding eyes, cunning eyes, and he set his devil's eye upon her. And she followed them into the field, making believe she was carrying him a lunch. And when he turned in the tall grass he looked her straight in the face and then he placed his devil's hand upon her. And he felt she was wearing nothing underneath. No garment, no protection, nothing to hide her shame. Nothing to stay that old devil's hand. And he was pleased. And she giggled, and she quivered, and she carried on something else. Well then suddenly she got the fear. Well you see, fear ain't enough when underneath there ain't nothing to cover up. When there ain't no barrier to keep that old devil out. Well this man, this devil's messenger, he took her and satisfied her lust. And when they walked from the tall fields that devil laughed. And his laugh forced her to laugh. But lord she wanted to cry. She had to laugh because the devil laughed. And her body was a shaking now, and a quivering because the devil was in her and he wasn't about to leave. And would you believe? Would you believe that this poor sinner-- this poor fornicator thought she was free? Oh, she walked from that field an adulterous and she thought she was some kind of great woman. Well every time the devil laughed she laughed. And soon she found she couldn't stop laughing no matter how she tried. And how many you women out there can stop laughing? How many women you out there can stop smiling? How many of you women out there can stop smirking? You can't, because you are the devil's prisoner. He's sitting inside you laughing and you don't even know it. Yes, he's a cancer eating away. And Lord you-- Brothers and sisters, you see those two signs, shipping and receiving. If you ain't ready now to receive the Lord than ship out, brother. Ship out. Now who's first to be saved? Come on up here. Who's first to be saved? Empty your pockets of the devil's money and be saved. Let me lay my hand on you and you are saved. Who's first to be saved? Come on up. Come on up. Who's first to be saved? Empty your pockets of the devil's money and you are saved. [GUN SHOT] Take your hands off of her. Sheriff, this is the house of the Lord. Not with you in it it ain't. We warned you to get out and stay out. I listen now to the voices of the devil. You can cut out the cunning game, Mr. Huxley. We know you ain't no real preacher. He's a criminal. As God as my witness, I am being framed. Wanted in three states. Are you going to allow them to touch a man of the Lord? Now hold on Zero and Leon. Judd, don't interfere with the law, you're in a heap of trouble already. Oh, am I? Oh, am I. Now listen here Mr. Zero Bull, you call a barging in here, busting up a fine service, making everybody feel all jittery and unwelcome. I'm the deacon in this here church and I say get. And I mean get. Why you old fool, I've got a warrant for his arrest. The federal government's looking for him? They is? Why that's a different story. We better ask the preacher about that then, I reckon. I'm forming a posse. I baptize the whole congregational. All of you on the left follow me. All of you on the right follow Leon. and be real careful because he's dangerous. Come oh, honey. Come on. I ain't going, Amos. I can't. What are you talking about? Carolina is just down the road a piece If you hurry you can make it. AMOS: Ain't you going? I done told you, Amos. I can't. What about all our plans? All The travelling? What-- what about you and me? Amos, I can't go. Mary Lou, it's Clyde, ain't it? Well that boy whipped you something fierce. Well good luck, honey. Hey listen there's a little package underneath your mattress. You give it to the deacon. He'll know what to do with it. God bless you, Mary Lou. Bye! God bless you, Amos Huxley. Yeah. Sheriff, sheriff, this way. Clyde? Let him run, Clyde. Let him go. Well where the hell is he? Clyde Massingale, you sent us on a wild goose chaise. You are more of a dimwit than I thought you was. There he goes, sheriff. Down the highway. Let's head him off with the truck. [HORN HONKING] THEME SONG: While the preacher man preached all the sins of a women the lady in the red walked in. From a front row seat in the congregation she gave him a hungry grin. And when the preacher man ran for his life guess who kept him from a jailhouse bed? The last thing the sheriff could see was the preacher man fleeing with the lady in red. You better run preacher man. You better run for your life. The sheriff's got a gun, and the sheriff's got blood in his eyes. You took his young daughter and you preached the congregation of men. You better run, preacher man, or the sheriff's going to do you in. You better run, preacher man, or the sheriff's going to do you in. MUSIC PLAYING: I've been saved by the preacher man. Hallelujah, I've been saved. No more doing wrong from right. No more sneaking out at night. I'm going to do all the good I can for I've been touched by the preacher's hand. Hallelujah I've been saved by the preacher man. My life was filled with wrong till the preacher man came along. And with the help of the angel Leroy he gave stand. He saved my soul from Hell. Now I'm happy, I can tell. Hallelujah, I've been saved by the preacher man. I've been saved by the preacher man. Hallelujah, I've been saved. No more doing wrong from right. No more sneaking out at night. I'm going to do all the good I can for I've been touched by the preacher's hand. Hallelujah, I've been saved by the preacher man.
