- Good kill, brother. Target's down, headshot. - Oh, shit. It was aiming for center of mass. I gotta get my scope checked out. - Yeah, we had some wind kick up there. I'm sure that threw it. Still hit the motherfucker. I'm impressed. Lima 2, this is Reaper 2, come back. - Go ahead, Reaper. - Affirming good kill at 1602 hours at 1602 hours. - Roger that, stand by. - I thought I missed him for a second. - Right, you only miss if you want to, right? - That's right. - Reaper team, you are go for exfil. - Roger that. - It's about time. What the fuck? - You good? - Yeah. Yeah, let's get home. - Amen to that. - You got one? Think fast. - Interior design. - I'm gonna say some kind of banking. - Excuse me, boys. I just quickly wanted to say thank you for your service. I'm so very proud of what you do for us. - Well, thank you Ma'am. We'll be sure to keep at it for you. And may I ask what it is that you do? - Me? I just work at the Chamber of Commerce. - No way. That's very important work. We should be thanking you for your service, Ma'am. - Well, boys, I just wanted to say thank you. - Chamber of Commerce, pretty close to banking, bro. Pay up. - It's the second time this week. - Yeah. Get used to it. - Lucky. - What's the matter, you don't like the thank yous anymore? - That lady has no idea what she's thanking us for. - Are you all right? - Yeah. Yeah. Just tired. - Oh. Perk up, Mr. Family Man. You gotta put your game face on. Excuse me, Miss, did you happen to order one large pussy? - That was me. Thanks for the fast delivery. - You got it. - Do not encourage this idiot. Hey, you're gonna take it easy tonight, right? - Yeah, I'll be good. What? I'll be good, I swear, dude. - Hurry up and get over here. There's barely any color in your face. Tough day at the office? - I'm just happy to be home. - Hey, hey, Mel? Sorry about that joke. That was way more vulgar than I thought it was gonna be. - I forgive you, Marco. Thanks for bringing him home in one piece. - Come on. Let's get you inside. - Daddy! You're home. - Oh, jeez, how much did you grow in 10 days? Oh, it's good to see you. Mom didn't tell you that I was coming home today? - I really wanted to keep it a surprise. - Can we watch a movie now that Daddy's home? - No, no, you're still grounded. Homework, and then straight to bed. - Be serious. - Get back to work, okay? I'll come and help you in a little bit. Go, go. Grounded? - Yeah, and I'm being nice. - What happened? - She stole her frame picture of her teacher's baby, and put it beside her bed. It would be super weird if it wasn't so fuckin' cute. - That's still weird. - I know you did a bad thing, but that doesn't make you a bad person. We all do bad things sometimes, sweetie. Things we know are wrong. Nobody's ever been perfect and no one ever will be. It's what you do now after you've made the mistake that says who you really are. - Yeah. I'll bring it back tomorrow. - Okay, let's give your daddy a hug and get tucked in. - Daddy, is your job hard? - Um, well, no. I've been doing it for a long time. - Do you get scared? - No. I used to, but where I work now, I keep the bad people far away. - And that's really important, right? And that's why you always leave? - Get some sleep. Goodnight. - Night. - You like that one? - Yeah, I'm just trying to make sense of it. - Come on. You don't recognize it? That one is you. Limited edition. - It's uncanny. - Well, it's like looking into a mirror, right? - Oh, it kind of scares me a little bit. - Hey, if you ever wanna talk about things with work, I'm here. - No, no, no, no, no. You and Wendy don't need to know about that shit. - I just want you to know that I'm listening. - I'm home, okay? - Okay. - I need to keep it separate. It's for me. Okay? I love the painting. - Thank you. Perfect, and then butter in the fridge if you can. - Okay. - Thanks, sweetie. Thank you. And three plates with a knife and a fork. - Shit. Honey, can you take over? - Yeah. - Hello. - Senior Petty Officer Bryant? - Yes, Sir. - Colonel Nathan Bernham. I believe you were told to expect my call. - I was Colonel, but not until after my current leave. - Well, sorry for the early call, but we're movin' fast on this situation. I need to get you briefed this afternoon and on your way in 15 hours. - With all due respect, Colonel, it's been less than a 24 hour turnaround. I'm not sure that I'm ready. - You and Miller are the only names on our roster and we need this done. - Roger that. I'll come in. - Perfect. See you then. - Okay, just put them up really good. - Okay. - Everything okay? - How 'bout some more toast, yeah? Good. Yeah. I'm gonna miss you, kiddo. - Can you come back soon? - Soon as I can, sweetie. Take care of your mom. - Do good. Stay safe. - Bye, Dad. - Jon. - Can't get rid of you, huh? - Yeah. Turned our shit around quick, huh? - Yeah. - What's with this building man, they didn't wanna do this on base? - Oh, it seems like they're rushing us. - Yeah. - Especially if they called us off leave early. Somebody must have really fucked up. - Well, they called the fixtures though, eh? - Bryant, Miller? I'm Bernham. Follow me. This room is kinda tough to find. Place looks like a maze. Sorry again to pull you from your leave, fellas. Couldn't be helped. - That's all right, Colonel. Just gonna have to smooth things over with my wife a little when I get back. - Had a feeling I'd like you guys. Have a seat, fellas. That's Morris, Agency. I'll be spearheading this operation, he'll be looking on. - It should go without saying that this is classified as top secret, gentlemen. - Understood. - They know that, Morris. How are you two in the cold? Because you are headed to Northeast Ukraine. The Russian backed separatists there have mostly surrendered to the army, but the war hasn't completely burned out just yet. The target is Fyodor Burick, he's the leader of a newly founded, fast growing anarchist militia that's been assembled from the remnants of other dissolved groups. This guy wants to reignite the war and he knows how to do it. The U.S. needs to keep out of the situation, but we'd also like to keep this asshole from stirring up more violence than he already has. Intel says Theodore was likely wounded in a firefight last week and has taken refuge in this cabin away from the front lines, presumably till he's able to fight again. Infill will be near the border in the Russian wilderness. You'll hike through the woods, take out the target, come right back the way you came. - What kind of resistance are we lookin' at? - Woods are mostly clear. A few militia floating weapons, gear, food in and out, but no one's expecting a fight out there. - Is there a strike point? - Well, the cabin here has some likely spots around if that'll work, but you'll need to determine that yourselves once you're on site. Surveillance is tough out there. You don't have any assets in play, and because it's the fuckin' woods, so we'll rely heavily on your eyes, your intel. - All due respect, Colonel, sounds like you're asking us to do the job of the about seven people. - What we need most here is precision. Accuracy and efficiency are the name of the game. - There's no nearby support? - That's correct. Aside from an angel in the sky covering exfil, you two would be the only American forces in the area, which is why we value the secrecy here. I'm sure you understand. - Sir, may we ask, was there a team sent before us? - Yes. We sent a pair of hitters five days ago, first day Fyodor was spotted in the woods. They failed to eliminate him and were pulled out immediately. It doesn't look like they gave themselves away, but we wanna get in there before they realize we're onto their hideouts. - Did they engage anybody? - No. They didn't make it to a mile within the target before being extracted. To be honest, I don't want you to worry about them. Their op won't have any effect on yours. - Well, we should confer with them if we can. - Wouldn't help. There's a lot of confusion on the ground and both of them are currently in for full psych evals, so we're thinkin' the cold and stress got to 'em. Listen, no judgment from me. It's a high conflict area and that weather is no joke. I know you SOF boys like your planning and your estimates, but we're movin' fast. If you're good at what you do, I'm sure you can handle it. - Colonel, we're good at what we do because we know how to plan for situations. - We don't have that luxury on this. We're planning for one bullet to meet one man's head. I want to get you in there, I want you to get that done, I want you to do it tomorrow and be finished with it. You take some coffee in a Thermos, it'll still be hot by the time you get back. - Okay then, let's get there. - Good. We'll get you a lift over to the base and get you on a plane right away. Thank you, fellas. I'm sure you can pull this off. You've got that get shit done look about ya. It'll be fine. We'll be fine. - Well, apparently having a plan is a luxury now. What the fuck is that about? - I'm not worried. I wasn't gonna do any plan that fuckin' Stripes dealer gave us anyway. - Right. - Come on, brother. Let's do what we do. - Reaper 1, come back. - This is Reaper 1, go ahead. You've got a green light to cross the border. - Roger that, Poseidon. Movin' out. Good? - Good to go. They weren't kiddin' about this cold, man. Fuck! - Just gotta keep your blood flowin'. - "Just gotta keep your blood flowin." Whoa! Oh, fuck. - You all right, man? - Yeah. God damn ice. - Yeah, blame it on the ice. We're making good time. Let's take five. - Less than 24 hours leave. My mom gave me hell about leavin' her again. - You got scolded by your mom? - Man, I helped her move a few months ago and ever since then she's been treating me like her personal handyman. She doesn't know how to use the TV, the stove, the fireplace. I mean, it's a switch, Mom. Is Mel pissed? - Yeah. Yeah, I think she wants me to quit, you know? Do something else. What the fuck else am I gonna do? I just never know where to take that. - Oh, you married bitches been having that same conversation for decades. - But when you figure it out, you let me know. - Roger that. What you thinkin'? - Just about the last team. I don't like that we're following in the footsteps of a failed op. - If they didn't blow their cover, why not? - Just 'cause Bernham said they don't know what happened out here. - Well, we ain't goin' around this shit unless you want to add two days and get closer to the fighting, so. - No, no. Hey, we're gonna exfil right back through this way, so why don't we do ourselves a favor and Hansel and Gretel this spot just in case? - Roger that. - What do we got on us? - Well, if you've got an extra jacket I can rig up a rope-a-dope. - I got a long sleeve. It should work in a pinch. Hey, just remind me to grab that on the way back. I like that shirt. - Yes, Sir. - I'm gonna see what I can set just a little ways up. - You think I can add booby trapping skills to my resume back home? - Yeah, right under handyman. Hey, hey! What the fuck? - Movement up ahead. 20 yards. I'll cover, you flesh 'em out. - Copy that. - Moving. - Move. - It's Russian. - Close enough. Come out now. There's nothing here, bro. - No one's there? - I don't see anybody. No footprints even. - I coulda sworn I saw somebody standing right there. - Nah man, we're clear. I'll keep my eyes up. - All right, well let's head back. Finish setting up and move out. - Copy that. - Not a single person movin' through this window. - Confirmed. Count one single military aged male. - We've got some elevation just to the north. They'll put us dead onto the front door. - Well, they got a shot at him through these windows from here. - Nah. I don't wanna chance we missed ones inside. Plus, I see an ax and firewood. It's gonna get cold tonight. I'm sure he'll wanna start a fire. Set. - Got him. He's in the kitchen. - Roger. Let's get a positive ID now so we can pop him off when we get the chance. - He's got his back to us. Standby. - Ah, I don't have him either. - I'm ready for him. - I lost him. - Fuck. He's sittin' down. Shit. I can't get a PID. You see any windows on the side walls? - Yeah, there's some on the left side. If you wanna go around and flank that tree line, you can get a PID through that window. - All right. Movin' out. See you soon, bro. - Sound check. - Copy 2. - Yeah, I'm in position. I got a view, but yeah, I still can't make positive ID. I think this guy fell asleep, brother. We may be waitin' this one out, Reaper 1. - Roger that. I'm comfy. - Yeah, you're comfy. That makes one of us. - How you holdin' up, Reaper 2? - Yeah, just enjoying this winter fuckin' wonderland. - Look alive. He's moving. - I got him. Still no ID. - He's moving through the kitchen. - Fuck, I lost him. - I got him. He's goin' to the front door. Shit, he's gonna go outside. That'll give us about 20 seconds to make the ID and make the shot. - I'm ready. Let me know when you've got his face. - I got him. Go. - White male. - Confirmed. - 50s. - Confirmed. - Balding. - Confirmed. - White goatee. - Confirmed. - Glasses. Thin round, metal frames. - Negative. No glasses. - Shit. - Give me something else. - That's all the intel I got, brother. They gave us fuck all in this pack. - I got glasses, I got glasses confirmed. - That's PID. Take him. One shot, brother. - One shot. - Oof, yeah, that's a hit. He's not gettin' up. Good shot, brother. - Let's rendezvous. - Roger that. Good work, brother. - You get 'em up yet? - Pull 'em up now. Poseidon 6 Romeo, this is Reaper 2 confirming good kill at 0424 hours at 0424 requesting order to exfil. - Roger that, Reaper. Exfil confirmed. - Roger that, movin' out. They're sendin' the bird. Let's go. - Let's move. Hey, here we go. - You ever find it weird that the person flying that thing is probably just in Vegas smellin' like cheap booze and strippers? - Reaper 1, this is Angel 6. Do you copy? - Angel's probably her stage name. You take it. - Reaper 2, copy. Go ahead. - Angel 6 on station. Turn over complete. Confirm your kill time. - That's 0424 hours. - In that case, we've got an issue, Reaper 2. - This is Reaper 1. What kind of issue? - Poseidon 6 Romeo is picking up chatter. According to them, your target is still active being moved outta the combat area now. - Oh. How sure are we on that? - Chatter was picked up from multiple sources and confirmed. - We confirmed before firing. We had a positive ID. - Looks like you may have been given some bad intel, Reaper. - Fuck! - Then who the fuck did we shoot? - Stand by, working on it now. - Fuck! - Angel 6, Reaper 2. What are our orders? - Do not exfil. Stay on station until new orders come through. - Roger that. Standing by. It's bad intel. It ain't on us, brother. - This is just so fucked. - We just gotta sit tight and wait for orders, okay? There's nothin' we can do until we get those. Look man, I've been in these collateral damage situations, all right? It's gonna hit you hard later, but right now we're on the job, man. - No collateral damage. That's the whole point of sending us. - Man, if we're fuckin' up then something else is seriously wrong. I'm fine, I'm fine. - What do you say we find a place to get off our feet and wait for further instructions, huh? - Yeah. - Come on. - Yeah. Roger that. Angel 6, any update on those orders? - That's negative, Reaper 1. Stand by for target location. - Stand fuckin' by. We've been standing by. - What could they possibly be trying to figure out? Angel Six, are you detecting any hostiles near our previous target location? - Stand by. - What you thinkin'? - I wanna know who that was back there. - That is not a good idea, bro. - They obviously need proper intel, and I'd feel a hell of a lot better if we went back and find some kinda chemicals or somethin' stashed in advance. - Our job is done, okay? - That's a negative. No hostiles detected on the previous target site. - It's your show, man. I'm with you. Whatever you wanna do. - Angel 6, be advised, we're gonna head back to the previous target location. See what we can find to help clear this up. - Roger that, Reaper. I'll maintain surveillance. - I'll make this quick. It's still clear. Let's move out. - How's that? Well, can't check PID now. - No wallet. - All right, let's clear the house first. - Clear! - Clear! - Got a weapon. It's not loaded. Looks like a hunting rifle. - There's nothing suspicious about this place. I think we really fucked up. - Oh, shit. - Angel, come back. - Go ahead, Reaper. - We have some new intel on the victim. His name is Pavel Oliynyk. We did a sweep of the house. We didn't find anything related to militia activity. - Roger that, Reaper. I'll send that up the chain and get more information. - You okay? - We don't do this. - Jon, this is bad intel, okay? It's not on us. - No. We don't do this. - Reaper team, look alive. Three hostiles moving fast, two clicks Southwest. You need to leave the area immediately. - Roger that, we're moving. Jon, what are you doing? What's the hold up? Jon? Jon, we gotta go now, man. - Why aren't you moving, Reaper? - Where are you going? - Did you hear that? - Someone creepin' up behind us? - No. It's something else. - Jon, we gotta leave now, man. We're gonna end up in a fire fight, you understand? - Reaper, move out. - Fuck. - Jon! Fuck! Move, move! God damn it, Jon, you fucked us. - Hey, Angel, we could really use that plan for exfil. - No words, fellas. Get clear and report back once you're safe. - Yeah, no shit. - Roger that. - What are you doin'? - Angel, are you detecting anything other than the three hostiles that we're lookin' at? - That's a negative, Reaper 1. Only tracking three MAMs. - Roger that. Just keep your eyes peeled for us. - Roger that. - Let's move out. - Yeah, go. I got you. - What should we do? - Angel 6, we've left the previous target location. We're about two clicks from the house. - Roger that, Reaper. Hold your position until we receive orders. Stay alert. - Copy. - I don't think we can just wait around. If these guys have eyes, they'll be able to track us pretty easily. - Where do you wanna move? - I say we go around the scene. God damn it! What the fuck is that? - What? What is it? - My 12 o'clock. Just stay on me. - I got you. - Jesus! - Right? - What the fuck? What the fuck is it? Jon, are they on us already? - No, no, no, no. It's something else. God. Angel 6, we've got somethin' trackin' us and we can't get a positive read on it. Do you got anything on my 12 o'clock? - That's a negative on hostiles in your area. - Just straight ahead 100 yards. - I got eyes up, but you gotta help me out here, brother. I don't see anything. - It's tall, thin, black, no weapons. We should be able to see it. - Come on, let's keep movin'. - I saw something. - Jon, I'm not arguing with you on that, okay? But if there's somethin' out there, I don't wanna sit around and wait for it, huh? - Yeah, start movin'. It's American issued. - Well, fuck. - Looks like they're still on the path of the last team. - I don't like that they were droppin' shit on their way out. - Me neither. Better check your bow. - I'm good. - Yeah, me too. - What do you see? - You didn't hear that? Holy fuck! I got it. - What is it? - I don't know. I've never seen anything like that. - Where's it at? - My 12 o'clock into that tree line, 200 yards. Wait, it's moving. All right? What the fuck? I got 150 yards. My 2. - I don't have it, stay on it. - God, it's looking right at us. - You don't know what it is? - I can't tell but it's fucking looking at me. If it gets any closer, I'm gonna fire on it. - Can you confirm that it's enemy hostile? - I've never seen militia look like that. - Do not fire unless you have to. - Fuck! Wait, I lost it. Oh God, 100 yards straight ahead. - Help me out here. I still got nothin'. - I'm firing. - No, no, no. Do not fire, Jon! Let me get eyes on it first. - That's a hit, center of mass. Dead in front of us. - Is that it at 12:30? - Are you fucking with me? It went down right there. - Jon, you're not fuckin' givin' me what I need, man. If it's down, point me to it. - It's right... Fuck, it's gone. I didn't even see it move. - All right. If you hit it and that thing is hurt, it ain't comin' near us after takin' a shot like that. Come on. - Reaper team, stay alert. - Roger that, Angel. - Three hostiles approaching your location. 250 yards out coming from the south/southwest. Target's dispersed. - Fuck me, they heard that shot, Jon. - Target one closing in from the south, target two from the west. Lost visual on target three. - Roger that, Angel. I got 'em comin' up the hill. - Do not engage unless there's an immediate threat. - Yeah, yeah, we let 'em hit us first. Got it. Thanks. What do you wanna do, Jon? - We got about 30 seconds. Let's split up. That way when they go straight through us, if we have to engage, you can flank 'em. - Yeah. Roger that. - Right. Stay low. I got eyes on green mask. - I'm on green mask, too. He's comin' straight for me. I don't have eyes on other one. Oh shit, Jon, don't fuckin' move. Take him. - Hey. - Huh? - Drop it! Drop it, now! Angel 6, we've engaged hostiles. We've taken down two of 'em. Do you have eye- - Reaper 2, say again. Reaper 2? - 2, 2 come in. He won't come in. - Sniper. There's a sniper in place. Sound check from the east. - I heard it. At least a quarter mile away. You okay? - Yeah, I took one of the chest. Armor, caught it. I'll be all right. - How the fuck did they make that shot through the trees from so far away? I got nothin', 2. Angel 6, you have any information on the enemy sniper to the east/northeast? - That's a negative, Reaper 1. Scanning the area now but no visual. - Angel 6, I don't suppose there's a snowball's chance in hell of gettin' an airstrike is there? - That's another negative, Reaper. You're the only assets in the area. - Reaper 2, we're gonna have to wait it out. - No, no, we can't wait them out. I'm sure they've already reported our position and we're gonna have a whole crew of people on our asses if we stay perched here. You okay, 2? - Yeah, I think this fucker cracked a couple ribs but I'll live. - Keep your eyes up. That thing is still out here with us, too. - Okay, can we just focus on this guy please, man? - Reaper team, I'm being told that Poseidon 6 Romeo will not approve an exfil with enemies in pursuit. - Why the fuck not? - We can't risk anyone seeing our choppers, especially a sniper. You need to lose them or take them out before they'll send anyone. - Motherfucker. Angel 6, be advised, we still have two enemy hostiles. We have the enemy sniper and something else that's out here with us. - No, no. Angel 6, we're on the sniper. We eliminate him and we're clear. - Reaper 1, confirm? Reaper 1, do you have a second target? - That's a negative, Angel 6. We'll take out the sniper and be done with him. Listen up, 2. How far are you from that Hansel and Gretel? - About 100 yards. This fuckin' guy's all over me, man. - Just one step at a time, all right? - I'm gonna take a peek. - Reaper 2, you okay? Reaper 2? - Yeah, I took some shrapnel in the face. My cheek is fucked but I'll live. - If he's still on you that means he hasn't spotted me yet. One more shot and I got this motherfucker. - One more shot and I'm gonna lose my head, man. - Hey, listen to me, listen to me, all right? Just take a breath. Pop smoke in both directions. When it gets thick enough, you make a run for it. Can you run? - Fuck. Yeah, I can run. I got you. Stay on glass, poppin' smoke. Poppin' smoke. Cover me in three, two, one. - Come on, buddy. Come on, buddy. No, go, go, go, go. Fuck. Sniper's down. We're in the clear. I'm comin' to you. - Roger that, Reaper. Good work. - Hey, you okay? - Yeah, fine, fine. Oh. What the hell is wrong with you, man? - What? - You know how dangerous it was to go back to that house and I told you not to take that shot and you did, and you almost got me fuckin' killed. - Just listen to me. - You're fuckin' fallin' apart, Jon. - I'm fuckin' doin' my job. All right? I'm identifying and eliminating threats. At least I thought I was. - Forget about that guy back there, man. He's not our problem, okay? He's the State Department's problem. - He's not. - He's the fuckin' agency's problem. - Not about the fuckin' guy. There was something else out there. - Even if there was something coming after us, you're not in a place where you can fucking deal with it, okay? You're not being careful, you're not communicating with me and you're not fucking listening to me. I know what it's like to lose it out here, but you've gotta get control of yourself, okay? Look, I'm not trying to downplay what happened back there, or what we did, but we've gotta get home before we can deal with that. - I'm not crazy. - Yeah, I know that. - Fine. Call it in, get us home. - Angel 6, this is Reaper 2. Come back. - Go ahead, Reaper. - We've eliminated all targets. We just need that exfil order and we're ready to get the fuck outta here. - You've got a new set of orders coming down the pipeline. Stand by for relay. - Wait, what new orders? - It's so fucked. - Reaper team, Poseidon 6 Romeo actual. Copy? - Go ahead, Sir. We got you. - Listen, I know you guys were put in a tough spot back there, but we can't pull you out just yet. Picked up more chatter that says Fyodor Burick is headed to a small training compound five clicks from your location. - Sir, this is Reaper 1. We've already encountered hostiles, Reaper 2 is wounded, and we're almost completely outta supplies. We were told that this was gonna be a quick mission as per your suggestion, Sir. - I hear you, but we're outta time. This has to happen now and you're the only assets out there. - Sir, there's also another complication that I have to tell you about. We've been seeing this- - No, no, no. - What the fuck? - Do you know what it means to talk about seeing shit in the woods? Do you know what'll happen when we get back? That's immediate removal from field work, Jon. It's 10 years of psych evals. I'm not havin' that. - Okay, boys. The fact of the matter is that this is a mess that still needs to be cleaned up. I need you out there now. - We'll deal with it, Sir. - Report back when mission is complete. - Roger that. This is our job. Let's do it. - No, it's you who can't see what's really happening here. - You might not be crazy, but I'm fuckin' crazy. Hey, we're about two clicks out. Five hours till sun up. I say we hold up here till the morning and find that spot then. Target's not gonna move tonight anyway. - All right, I got first watch. - Hey? Hey, I need to know you got my back on this, man. Look, we'll sort this shit out over beers when we get home, but I need you to tell me that you're still up for this. Hey, hey! - What the fuck? - Come on! - What the hell was that? - Are you all right? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm okay. What the fuck is that? - I don't know, but it keeps closing in on us. - All right. What you say we put some distance between us and it, huh? - Yeah, roger that. I'll cover you, go. - Jon, come the fuck on, man. Let's go! - Marco? Fuck. Marco! - Jon, hurry up! - Marco? - Get this fucking thing off me! Jon! - Marco? - No, no! Jon? You there? - Where are you? Crack a light! Oh, fuck! You all right? - Yeah. That fucker tried to grab my face but I stabbed that bitch and he ran off. What happened to your pack? - We're gonna have to use yours. - Fuck, it's out there. You wanna go get it? - Come on. - What do we do now, man? - Keep your eyes open, keep moving and don't let that fuckin' thing near you. - Okay. - All right, come on, let's ditch the lights. Come on. Fuck. - You got anything? - No, still nothing. - I need to take a rest, man. My ribs are fucked. - How's your face? - Oh, I still got vision in both my eyes, I suppose that's lucky. I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry, I thought you might be crazy but I've never seen any shit like that. - Man, I think we both might be goin' a little crazy. You know, I've never felt one way or another about this job, but when that thing looked at me, I thought I was dead. But it wasn't Mel or Wendy that I saw. But you were right. I got this image of that guy just sitting in his chair, reading his book. I don't know why but I can't shake it. Just some old fucking guy and I can't shake it. - When I was in Korengal, mortar round exploded right next to our platoon mechanic. And we watched the lower half of his legs just blow clean off, man. And when we were pulling shrapnel outta our guys, we realized that our platoon leader has a piece of the mechanic's bone just lodged in his arm. It was fuckin' stickin' straight up like a straw, man. He had a piece of bone stickin' out of his arm. It wasn't even fuckin' his. I just think about how fuckin' funny that was. And then, you know, I kinda, I wonder how could that possibly be funny? Something only guys like you and me can get, you know? That's where my head goes when I'm by myself. It's quiet for awhile. But I never felt bad about the job. So, whatever that thing is, we can't let it win. - Angel 6, come back. - Go ahead, Reaper. - Angel, we've lost all our supplies and extra ammo, and Reaper 2 is wounded to the point where he may not finish the mission. We have to put in a final request for exfil. - Understood. Stand by. - What are you doin', man? - I want them to say it on the record. - What do you think Mel's gonna say about all this shit? - Nah man, this is my bullshit. She doesn't need to know about it. - Really? 'Cause I'm gonna tell this story to every chick I know, man. I'm gonna get laid for days. - Not with your face all fucked up like that. - That's another negative, Reaper. Once we get confirmation that the target is down, we will request an exfil, and get you home. - Roger that, Angel. - You think we can make it without the rest of our gear? - How much ammo you got? - Two full mags. You? - Seven rounds. - Fuck. - Six more than I need. - Right. We keep eyes forward and I watch our six in case our little friend dares to come back. - Roger that. - Okay, brother. Let's do what we do. - Good luck. - I count eight hostiles on the south side of the building. One to the north. - We got eyes on eight. - Reaper 1, can you see what's being unloaded from the trucks? - It looks like weapons, but we only got boxes right now. - Roger that, Reaper. - This is a lot more than we expected. - Yeah. - If we drop someone out front, you can bet that they're gonna have the whole crew on our asses. See if they'll exfil us then. Hey, check it out. Zone three. What's that look like to you? - Target practice. - Yeah. Let's fling to the right, get in line with it. - Angel 6, we've got possible eyes on target. Can you provide PID? - Yes, we can provide PID. - Are you sure you don't wanna move over? We can pop him when he comes around the corner. - No, we're too close. There's too many of them together. - I'm just thinkin' if we're gonna see a fire fight we might want that flank after all. - I don't think we should split up again. - No, neither do I, but it's a good way to end this quickly. - I'm not worried about that. I'm worried about that thing creepin' up behind us. - We haven't seen that in awhile. - You do see it, you call me, I'm back in 10 seconds, yeah? - Fuck. All right. - It'll be okay, man. Move in. Yeah, I'm in position. I'm seein' some moving on the corner of the building. Could be comin' out. - Roger. Angel, could really use that PID. - Stand by. - We don't have time to stand by. He's out in the open. - Still gathering intel. - You gotta be fuckin' kidding me. - Orders are to take out the commander. No PID required to execute, direct from Private 6. - Fantastic, thanks. - We want the shot. - I think we got it. - All right, they're scattering. - Two officers approaching. - Two on your 6, I'll come around and cover. Jon, you got those three in the southeast corner? - I'm on it. Back corner. I don't have a shot. - Oh, fuck! - From behind ya, go the way. - Got a runner, headed north. - I got him, I got him. - That's the last of 'em. - Target's down, it's a non-fatal wound. - Reaper, target must be KIA. - Can we get that PID? - Negative, Reaper. - You have him, man. Take the shot. - He's unarmed. I need that PID. - Take that kill. Just take the God damn shot. - You're clear to fire, Reaper 1. - Oh, fuck! - 2, what are you doin'? 2, get back. Don't do it, let's wait for the PID. I have a clear shot. Reaper 2, come in. - This is Reaper 2, come back. - Go ahead, Reaper. - Confirming good kill at 1602 hours at 6- - 2, 2 come in. Come in, come in. - Marco? Reaper 2! Come in, Reaper 2! Marco, come in. Marco? 2? - Fuck! Come on, we don't have all day! Come on! Come on! Come on, come and get me! What are you fuckin' waiting for? Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Show yourself! Angel 6, come back. - I read you, Reaper. What's your status? - We engaged the enemy. We killed nine, including the target. Mission accomplished. Reaper 2 is KIA. Requesting exfil. - Are you injured? - I'm fine. Let's get home. - Roger that, Reaper 1. Angel 6 out. - You did a good job out there. I know we really put you through it, but I hope you know how important that job is. You're gonna get medals for this, you know? And we're not gonna include the loss of your weapons in the report. We won't mention the delay in taking out the target. I think a simple successful mission is enough to pass along, don't you? With everything you've gone through, why don't you talk to the therapist on the base? It's usually required for anyone KIA on the mission anyway, so why don't I just go ahead and make you an appointment, yeah? Sound good? - What happened to the last team? The first guys that you sent before us? - Okay. They refused the mission. They got out there and didn't like the odds or couldn't hack it, so they came back. That's why we had to put the screws to you a bit there. - Marco's mother is gonna need someone to help her out. - We'll get someone to check on her. - Good. - Whatever happens to him, it's on you. - I heard. I'm so sorry, baby. Are you all right? Are you hurt? - I'm fine. - Mommy? Daddy! You're home! - Jon, what are you doing? Honey, your skin is burning. Jesus, doesn't that hurt? - I'm freezing. - So I told Ms. Sullivan and then she put him in time out. - Oh, good. - So, I saw him. So he thought he couldn't get away with it. But then I saw him doing it again, and he actually did get away with it. - Daddy! - Honey. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, honey, I didn't mean to scare you. - How come you're still up, huh? - I was just gonna go get a glass of water. What are you doing up, huh? Mommy told me that you outgrew this whole coming to sleep with us thing. - I was hoping we could all wake up as a family. - Hey! - Hey. - Daddy? - Go back to bed, sweetie. You've been through something I can never understand. I accept that. But this cannot happen, not with Wendy in the house. I don't want you here right now. Not like this. I know you're hurting and I hate that you feel like you can't tell me what happened. Why can't you look at me? Jon? Jon, wait. Where are you going? - Bryant, it's good to see ya. - I need to talk to you. - It's not me you should be talkin' to, Jon. Okay, come with me. If it's the op you wanna talk about, there's not much I'll be able to tell you that you don't already know. - I wanna know why there were two targets. - What are you talkin' about? - I wanna know why there were two targets. I'm not fucking stupid. - You are way outta line, Jon. Now you need to get yourself some help before you start saying things that get you into trouble. - I also wanna know why it says on the report that it was a Reaper team error when it was your bad intel. - Jesus fucking Christ. Fine. You and your partner made a mistake, but it was a mistake you were meant to make, okay? The agency wanted Fyodor, but he was too well hidden. We had to find a way to flush him out. State Department wouldn't approve us taking out anyone close to him, so we created a situation where wires would be crossed and Fyodor's brother would catch a bullet. He comes outta hiding to find out who killed his brother, we take him out, whole thing gets logged as an accident, some fog of war kind of shit so we don't break any rules, but we get our man. - So you get everything that you want and accept no responsibility for it? - It worked. - I'm done. - I understand. - Where did you go? - I need to find some answers. I'm ready to talk to you, tell you what happened. The whole thing was routine. We had done it hundreds of times, but then we got the call that the target was the wrong target and I just, I lost my head. I lost focus and that's when Marco got shot. I got spooked. I got spooked out there. I saw something I'd never seen before. And then when I got back, I found out that they had lied to me, to us about the mission and I just can't stop wondering if they lied to us every single time. - God, I'm so sorry baby. What did you see out there? You can tell me. It's okay. Oh, shit. Wind must've picked up. - Hold on. What is it? - Just... - Jon? - Honey, go, go. Go, get Wendy. Get out of the house. - Jon, what do you see out there? - Go now. Don't just stand there, now! Go, go, go, go, go, go! No, no, no! Come on! - Honey, sweetie, wake up, wake up, wake up. We have to go to the car, come on. - What's going on? - Let's go, let's go. Come on. Hurry up. - Why? - Come on. I'll tell you in the car just, let's go. - Come on, come on! What do you want from us? Leave them alone! - Okay? Come on. Get in the car, get in the car. Okay? I see. No! - What's going on? - Okay, sweetie. If I'm not back in five minutes, you go into Mr. Marshall's and have him call 911, okay? - Mm hm. I love you, stay here. - Mommy, wait. - Stay here. - Mommy, wait. - Stay here! Jon? Jon? Honey, are you okay? - I know how to stop it now. - What was that? What was that? No, no, no, no. No, baby, don't do that, okay? Please. - You don't understand. It will tear us apart. - I know. I know you try to fight it. But you don't need to do this. This is not the way. - I'm sorry. - Oh my God. - Jon! Please, baby. - Come on! - It can't hurt me, it can't hurt me, okay? The only thing that can hurt- Please Jon, please! Look at me! Remember? We can fight it together. We can fight it together. We can. No, Jon! - Mommy? Mommy? Mommy? - Oh, sweetie, come here. It's okay, come here. I'm okay, baby. - What happened? Daddy, what happened? - Oh, sweetheart. I'm sorry. - Are you okay? - Yeah, Daddy just got a little scared. Are you okay? I'm sorry. - Hey. See something? - No, but it doesn't mean there's nothing out there. - Come on. Say goodnight to Wendy.
