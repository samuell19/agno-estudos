[audio logo] [mechanical noises] Thanks so much for coming on the show today. Well, my pleasure. Thanks for having me. And I can't believe the success you've had. Your book and still riding number one? Number one, New York Times. Yeah, so I'm very lucky and I'm very grateful. And I know you can't say too much about what's coming up, but it's my understanding you're working on a book about mythology in the Americas? Yeah, you're right. I can't really tell you too much about it. But what I can say is that it does squarely focus on the mythos and mythology surrounding fear and the concept of fear. When can your fans expect [sound skips].. I'm still really deep into the research into the book. I [sound skips] to Northern California to a very particular area that permeates fear. Fear, just as an emotion is a manifestation of something that we always perceive as just kind of a concept. It's not a concept. Fear is very real. Well, sounds like The New York Times better make room for another bestseller. I hope so. Your lips to God's ears. Diving this deeply into fear, as you described it-- Yeah. --does it strike fear in you? No. [squeaking mechanical noise] [haunting music] REPORTER (ON RADIO): So we've been covering this story for quite a while, but it seems like today's news might be the final chapter in one of the most bizarre stories we've had, the story of Angel Wilson. If you remember, Angel is the missing 26-year-old from 2015 who was camping in the Tahoe area and never returned home. Investigators-- Babes, turn it off. Hold on, listen. REPORTER (ON RADIO): Once they found that two of the friends that had accompanied her were discovered deceased from apparent suicide. Turn it off. REPORTER (ON RADIO): And today, news has broke that her remains might have-- [music playing] (SINGING) Said that he's a Gemini. Said that he liked the one to see her in that. Turned around and changed his mind. Thank you, babe, for getting me out of the house. We sure chose the best time to get away, right? Was I driving you crazy or were you driving me crazy? Why do you think I'm taking you on this trip? Thank you. All right, but, listen, I just don't want you all on top of me when you see what I'm taking you, OK? Yeah, yeah, OK. You're going to have to behave yourself. When's the last time you saw me in a dress? ROM: It's been a while. Thank you for wearing it. I'm surprised it still fits. You look beautiful. BIANCA: Thank you. You're welcome. BIANCA: Thank you. Thank you. BIANCA: I needed to get out of that office. Oh my god. What are you doing? You ready for this? What are you up to? Would you stop trying to figure everything out? I told you, I want this to be a surprise. So you're just going to get out on the side of the road? [door open alarm] [unsettling music] [heartbeat] Bianca, what are you doing? You don't have to wear that. Not up here. You have to wear this. I told you, I want this to be a surprise. The only way that's going to work is by blindfolding you. Please? I cannot believe I'm going to let you blindfold me. I am the luckiest man in the world. [music playing] Yeah you are, you've got two minutes. Two minutes. [engine revs] All I need. [music playing] (SINGING) In my deep depress, I am for a moment feels all up-- wanted. Thought I was in control. That's a trick back. Thinking I had earned love, going out bad. God, I'm scared of me, afraid to speak. I've noticed. Every time-- ROM: All right, stay put. BIANCA: Cannot believe I let you blindfold me. [music playing] (SINGING) It's hard for me to see. Too fast. You've been good to us. Mademoiselle. [chuckle] [wheeze] You need your inhaler? Thank you. Just give me a second. [inhale] You OK? Come on, get out here. Breathe some of this clean mountain air. Oh, two seconds away from taking this thing off. No, no, no, we're almost done. Five more steps. BIANCA: You're crazy. [music playing] (SINGING) I miss-- Step. Two steps. Lift up your right foot. Right. OK, I'm taking them off. No, not yet. Trying to find the perfect spot. Stay right there. [music playing] (SINGING) Afraid that you got to choose, help me decide. ROM: OK. You ready? Oh yeah, I'm ready. [music playing] (SINGING) My tears-- will flow. ROM: Take it off. [majestic music] Oh, Rom. It's beautiful. What is this? We're here to celebrate your birthday. I just figured everything that's going on in the world right now and me finally getting the book to the publishers-- FRIENDS: Happy birthday Bianca! FRIENDS: Bianca! Oh my god. [cheering] Oh my god! Go say hi. Come on, go, go, go! What? FRIENDS: Happy birthday. FRIENDS: Happy birthday, baby. [groan] [cheering] Who? Who do I give-- Me, me, me. Happy birthday. Beautiful. Oh my god. [all greeting] [camera clicking] [pop] Oh! Happy birthday! Happy birthday! Woo! [happy chatter] All right, guys, look what we have for you. Come on in. [music playing on speakers] - What? - Wow. Check It out. Check it out. Wow. Look at this. Look at that, huh? What up, dog! Ah. Yeah, yeah. Lou. Hey. Yes. [cheering] I am so sorry I'm late. He didn't do it. What do you mean? Did you give him the ring? He had the ring. I think he got nervous. Nervous? Does she know? - Lou! Hey. Do my eyes deceive me? Forest Park's finest Lou Powell. What up? Ah, it means so much to me. Thank you. How could I not? Hey, when was the last time all of us were together? Year ago, Detroit. I don't know. Was it that night at Coney Island? Coney Island, yeah, back in the day. Oh my god. I miss y'all. The D's big three, yeah. Yo, man, Lou wants to talk to you. What's up, Lou? What happened? Thanks, Russ. You wasn't going to tell him. Bro, everybody came here. It was perfect. What happened? I don't know. I can't believe I did it again. Again? How many proposals have you botched? Three, four, four. Four? This is number four, lucky number four. Well, at least you're consistent. It wasn't the right time. Right time? You had the ring? I had the ring. She was there? Yeah. So what the fuck you mean it wasn't the right time. [speaking simultaneously] Lou, Lou, Lou, chill, chill, chill. Look, look, look, we're here for you. We got tested. We came here to support you. Whatever goes down out here, we're your boys. Grow a pair. Get a ring. Hit a knee. Let's put a ring on her finger. Can we do that, gentlemen? LOU: That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. - All right? All right. OK, look, the weekend is not over with. I'm going to find the perfect time. FRIEND: Guys-- OK? Just trust me. FRIEND: Guys, guys, guys. Big three from the D. Let's get it. Let's go. I'm going to make it happen, three from the D. Big three from the D. Big three from the D. All right, everyone, gather round. Gather round. Gather round. Got the whole weekend to catch up. Now that we're all here, I'd like to be the first to say, welcome to the historic Strawberry Lodge. We've got this all to ourselves for the entire weekend. Not exactly the Four Seasons. More like one season, fall-- ing apart. [laughter] Oh, god, OK, come on, guys. [chatter] Thank you, Benny. But we don't need that. All right? I would like you all to meet the lovely Ms. Winrich. Thank you. Good evening, everyone. And welcome to the Strawberry Lodge. I'm absolutely sure that you'll all come to love it as much as I do. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean any disrespect by it. Sometimes, I just mess around with Michael to bring his ego down a few notches. The place is actually really beautiful. I took some pictures earlier. Hm. Ms. Winrich was kind enough to open up this entire lodge especially for us and was also the maestro in helping make this an A1 weekend. So, basically, be nice, assholes. I'd like to ask you to gather together for one photo. It's an old tradition we have here. We like to memorialize all who stay with us. That way, you never leave. I feel like I'm in "Get Out" right now. All right, guys, let's go, let's go. All right, all right. FRIEND: Don't dirty up my white. FRIEND: I feel good. I feel good. Let me get on of you. There you go. All right, then on three, one, two, [snap] oh. Oh! [laughter, chatter] Can we do one more for us? [coughing] OK, shout out to the time machine she used to go get that Polaroid camera. Three-- [snap] OK. All right. Thank you. All right. Thank you. [chatter] You're going to the guest one. Good to see you. It's such a pleasure to have you with us. I want to welcome you especially to Strawberry Lodge. Thank you. You carry the light, my dear. I can see it. You're a beacon. Congratulations. Ah-- Yes, yes, we're all very proud that Rom finished his new book. In fact, you know what? Before we leave, I'll get you a signed copy. How's that? That would be lovely. And I have something for you before I leave you guys for the weekend. Me? Yes. I'd like to give this to you. It's our own bottle of wine. This place just keeps getting better and better. This is something we give all our guests. Thank you very much. I'll make sure we toast with this tonight. Wow. You know what? Being out in the mountains is probably what the doctor ordered. No, what the doctor's ordered is for us to be social distanced and sanitize every time we blink. Can you for once stop being a nurse and try to have a good time? We're 106. Here we go. Look, right here. Whatever's in this old ass room, woosah. We're going to appreciate it, all right? All right. [old music on speakers] Oh. OK. This is cool. It's cute. It's not bad. [coughing] [deep breathing] What is she looking at? [snap] [snap] [snap] White people are into some strange shit. ROM: You like it? Yeah. It's rustic, isn't it? You know, this place was built in 1838. Burned down, got rebuilt in '53. This looks like the original furniture. It's so beautiful. And all the history here, Native American culture, into the Spanish. Gold rush happened right here, just down all the way from Sonora up to Tahoe. Everything OK? You didn't have to do this. I did. I did have to do this. For you. For us. My birthday was a week ago, Rom. But these last couple years have been crazy for us, between you getting your doctorate in religion and me finally finding a little bit of success. Besides, this place, there's so much history right here. OK, there you go. So you're already writing your next book now? No, no, I-- I know what it looks like. But I promise you, it's not that. Hey. I just wanted you to have this trip to remind you how special you are to me. (GRAVELLY VOICE) My dear, you're a beacon. Stop. Your nose, it's bleeding. [haunting music] You OK Yeah, fine. Are you sure? ROM: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I'm going to go hang out with the girls for a little bit. Cool? Yeah, totally cool. [door closes] Bye-bye, Mrs. Winrich. [hip hop music] (SINGING) She got a-- No, no, no, no, I correct you. As of two weeks ago, Rom Jennings is a bestselling author. Did I not tell you a year ago that we'd be having this conversation? What does it matter what anyone says about this deal if I'm his agent? Hello? [beep beep] Oh, you fucker. Come on. Give me a bar. Give me a bar in this old bitch. Woo! [hip hop music] Hey. Hey, Mike. I want you to forget about what happened outside. [sigh] No, listen, do not give yourself a hard time. There's a lot of people. That's a lot pressure. Rom, it's going to be a great weekend. You're going to turn it around. You're going to get it done, all right? It's going to work out great, OK? OK. Listen, in other news, the phone has been ringing. And I know you've been doing research. I'm going to need an outline from you sooner or later. I don't want to talk about that right now. - Rom, forget it. - Not right now. I'm not even talking about work. Who's talking about work? But-- I need fucking outline, all right? OK? OK. All right, listen, 30 minutes, I want everyone changed over by the firepit. I'll arrange something special. It's going to be a vibe. The girls are going to love it, all right? Thank you, Michael. I got you. We're good. This place is perfect for both of us. Take this. Go and have fun with your friends, all right? Thanks. [hip hop music] You know that lady from earlier? Mm-hm. You think she's leaving soon? Because she don't got a sign on the desk. She's already left, babe. But, apparently, it's actually a really cool story. So her family bought the lodge when it first burnt down in the late 1800s. They rebuilt what was left of it. They renamed it Strawberry Lodge. And now they rent it out to people on the weekends. Who told you all this? Rom. What? Rom think he's so slick. Why do you say that? Rom brought us out here to do research for his book. This whole thing is like the backdrop for another Rom Jennings bestselling novel. [bang] Oh! Stay right there. [knock knock knock] You OK? Guys, firepit, please. Everyone's waiting. ROM: All right, for anybody who's interested, this quaint little mountain town that we're in right now used to be part of Mexico until 1848 when it was ceded to United States. And then became Strawberry, California in '49, during the Gold Rush. Now, the gold brought belligerent, but determined miners and outlaws, fueled by whiskey and greed. Now, they came here for one reason and one reason only-- gold! Oh my-- stop! [laughter] Stop. You can't. Yo, I'mma go inside if y'all keep going. No, no, keep going. Keep going, Rom. Keep going. [chatter] [laughter] And they got their gold, all right. So these miners began to prey on the natives. They went into their villages and stole their women during the night. And these women decided they had had enough. And they made a pact. They called themselves las bruja and set it up so they would control the town. Documented reports state that these women were able to control the miners minds and make them hallucinate to the point they were so frightened they would kill themselves to escape the fear. Bullshit. [laughter] Bro, why would you tell us right now when we've got to go sleep? How am I going to sleep tonight? Oh, that baby's scared. I think we can all agree that if we've learned anything, it's that we've had to face a lot of fears. And I am so fucking tired of being scared-- scared of going outside, scared of taking chances, scared of doing the things we love. So why don't we make a pact? Let's all tell each other our most personal fears and just let them go. Fear will not rule us here, not tonight. Let's do it. I'll start. When I was 18 years old, I got hit by a car. And in that moment, I wasn't in control. It was terrifying. And the only thing that didn't break was this necklace. So my greatest fear is losing control. And as long as I wear this necklace, no matter what life brings me, I know that I'm going to be in control. OK, who's next? Birthday girl? Where do I start? Growing up in a religious household, I feared the consequences of losing my faith. It's why I read a Bible verse every night, pray without ceasing. Being an asthmatic, air is so precious to me. And now that air could kill me. My biggest fear has become losing the thing I took for granted the most, just breathing. Wow, OK. I'll take-- I'll take a shot at it. You know, where we come from in Detroit, you know, there's not a lot of options or opportunities. I made a promise to everyone that I would make it out of there no matter what. And my word is my bond, always has been. What we're from, it'll kill you if it isn't. So I have to say my biggest fear is not being trusted, especially by the people who are depending on me. So back in the day, Lou convinces me and Rom to go to the movies and see "Boyz n the Hood." At the end of the movie when Morris Chestnut is running and he gets sprayed in the chest and blood starts flying all over the place-- Oh, man, before me and Lou had to carry you out, you're staring at the screen in a trance. And you just go, "Ricky!" "Ricky!" [laughter] So good. What is your fear specifically? My biggest fear is blood. There's just something about it that I can't handle. So my biggest fear, as a mother, is honestly just not being able to provide for my son. My biggest fear is drowning. I can't swim. Except for baths. This woman will take a bath for three hours. [laughter] Oh, man. Claustrophobia, 100%. When I was a kid, my older brother used to lock me in the drawer under my bed. Used to be locked in there for hours in the dark flailing around. [coughing] So, yeah, that's why I'm getting cremated when I die. Small, confined spaces, coffins, not for me. I was in high school. I got pulled over. Cop didn't give me a reason. He just reached inside my window, snatched me out, slammed my head on the hood of the car. I was terrified. So I say, fuck the cops and fuck handcuffs. That's easy for me. My biggest fear is losing you. [cough] Bullshit. [laughter] I'll tell you what, you guys put this fire out. Let's set things up inside. I'm going to get that bottle of wine that the lovely Mrs. Winrich gave us, yeah? Woo! To us. Best weekend of our lives. Cheers to a great weekend and happy birthday. [creepy music] [happy chatter] FRIEND: Hey, Michael. FRIEND: What's up, Michael? Where you been? We've been waiting on you. Michael. Just, uh, so I know I keep saying this, but you guys have no idea what a great weekend we have ahead of us. Thanks for all being here. So let's, let's kind of close this evening off with a nice toast to the birthday girl-- Thank you. --to new books, being with people you love in crazy times. Yeah? Mm-hm. All right, let's get some glasses. [laughter] What did she drink tonight? [pop] Whoa. [laughter] There we go. [happy chatter] That's the spirit we need though. That's the spirit we need. Hey. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Yeah, salud. [all cheering] Cheers. Woo. And to Bianca. La familia. Yes. [r&b music] [suspenseful music] Oh. Mm. [gasp] Oh my god. Mm. Mm. [spit] [hacking coughing] [spitting and throwing up] Yo, what the fuck is in here, man? [panting] The fuck? What the fuck is this shit? This is why I don't fucking drink. Please, just put your glasses down. Maybe it's just old wine? Let's just forget it happened. Uh-uh. If anybody wants to drink any more, there's a couple more bottles of champagne and a bottle of tequila at the bar. It's got like a-- it's got like an aftertaste to it. Let's go. Sandpaper or something. Guys! No, but seriously, what was that? I have no idea. What did it taste like? Uh, man, go. Throw that shit away, man. I will. It's disgusting, man. 1938? [creepy music] [thunder noise] PREACHER (ON TV): God's word is sure. When God begins to speak, [sound skips] will rise up and live. And things that ought to be dead will lay down and die. When the word of the lord God can speak a word to you and and shall be healed! Hey, I'm sorry about the wine. How do we know everyone got tested before we came up here? Because everyone got tested. What are you talking about? I mean, how do we know? Because I arranged the test. That's how we know. What's the problem? Lou. What about Lou? Lou is sick. Dude, Lou's not sick. He got tested like everyone else. And how do you know he physically went and got tested? Bro, I'm telling you, I've been watching him. Ever since we got here, he's been coughing. And not just easy cough, like he's been coughing up a lung. I'm telling you, he's sick-- Benny, Benny, relax, relax. On my way to bed, I will go and check on Lou, make sure he's OK. I need you to concentrate on having a good time, all right? Relax. TELEVANGELIST (ON TV): And if god is panicking, oh my god. You may as well slit your wrists and your throat. What are you doing? Mrs. Winrich low key got some classics. Let me find out. [old timey music] (SINGING) Oh, oh, baby girl. [doo-wop] You ain't getting none to that music. We'll see about that. [giggle] Good night. FRIEND: Good night. Sorry about the wine. FRIEND: No worries. [throat clears] Hey, Lou, what a night, huh? [coughing] What up, doe? Listen, I want to ask you a question. Don't take it personally. I feel very stupid even asking. Nah, no stupid questions, go ahead. Shoot. OK, OK, how are you feeling? You feeling all right? What? How am I feeling? I feel fine. Yeah, you know, not me, you know, a couple of-- a couple of the others-- A couple of the others? Yeah, a couple of the other guys mentioned they saw you coughing-- So you came up here-- Absolutely not. --to accuse-- Absolutely not. --me of being contagious-- No-- --of a disease and being willing to spread it to my closest friends. That's what you're saying? No, I'm just trying to keep everything safe. What gives you the right to come up here and check me? Just crossing the-- crossing the T, dotting the I's, making sure-- Nah, man, I'm going to dot your I. How about that? How about I dot your I. Mm-- Man, get out from in front of my door. I feel fine. There's no need to get-- I took a test just like all of you other motherfuckers took a test. Fuck out my face. Squirrely mouth looking motherfucker. It's been good that we've been getting closer over the last few years. LOU (THROUGH DOOR): You're still here? I'm going. I'm going. Goodnight. If you need anything. [old timey music] (SINGING) Please come home. Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, baby girl. [doo-wop] [moan] UNIDENTIFIED VOICE: Murder-suicide, suicide, suicide. Murder-suicide. [muffled voices] UNIDENTIFIED VOICE: Murder-suicide. Suicide, suicide. The body of a woman inside. It's playing backwards. UNIDENTIFIED VOICE: Murder-suicide. Suicide, suicide. [muffled voices] UNIDENTIFIED VOICE: The body of a woman inside. Double murder-suicide. [music stops] BIANCA: Why would she give us that? I'm going to say something when she gets back. I mean, that was the weirdest thing I've ever seen. Mm-hm. I mean, it just totally ruined everything. Totally. It seems like such a sick joke. [water running] [creepy music] [thunder] [keyboard tapping] [click] [click] [click] [click] [click] [click] What do we do when we are overwhelmed by evil thoughts? Where do they come from? And, more importantly, how do they influence our emotions and our actions? [thunder] [rain pattering] [soft thunder noises] [water dripping] [heavy rainfall] [loud noise] [door creaks] [groaning noise] [water trickling] MAN (ON TV): In my research, people have described the most violence and horrific thoughts that they had. But what is more frightening is the sources of these ideations. [click] [click] [click] [click] [click] Angel of death? [click] [click] [click] [cracking] [shatter] [grunting uncomfortably] [click] [click] [click] "Wine used as initiation ritual." [click] Angel Wilson. [click] MAN (ON VIDEO): That's great. Turn around. Aw, Angel. [beeping] What? ROM: Wow. This has got to be the place. Found it. What is this? "By feeding these souls of light to the portal, the gatekeeper will be granted immortality to fulfill their infinite bondage to darkness?" "Believing what you fear will bring to the victim what they are afraid of." [quiet electrical buzzing] [clicking] [beeping] [labored breathing] [coughing] [clattering] [door banging] [wheezing and coughing] [gagging and coughing] [door slams] [gasp] "Once the ritual of la uva, the grape, is completed, the collecting of souls may begin." [quiet inaudible whispers] [childlike giggling] [soft gasp] [childlike giggling] [knocking] [whoosh] [knocking] [childlike giggling] You OK? Yeah. You left the kettle on. I was making tea. OK. Hey, you guys got to see this right now. [rain pattering softly] REPORTER (ON TV): Public health officials announced that a mysterious airborne contagion has been identified as the next major health crisis in global society. Its origin is unknown and is spreading at a rate like we've never seen. Minutes ago, Washington has confirmed that multiple infections of this deadly disease have been confirmed in both the East and West Coast. [coughing] REPORTER (ON TV): The CDC warns Americans take it serious. The director of the CDC has warned all Americans to prepare for the worst. Whatever you do, do not go outside. [static] [sound skips] Secure all windows and doors. Fear it. The air is contaminated Droplets can spread within seconds. This airborne virus can cause death within hours. Fuck. REPORTER (ON TV): Make sure that you are cautious-- We're basically trapped in this lodge indefinitely. After all these months and now we can't even go outside? We can't go outside. The people you are in contact with are infected. It might only be a couple of days. How do you know that? I don't. I'm just hopeful. Well, let's get real. Let's talk about it. Talk about what? Who is missing? What do you mean, Benny? Why don't you look around and tell me who's missing? Oh. Mike, say something. Russ, say something. You guys talk to him. Lou is sick. I mean, why are you doing this? Doing what? He told you that he has allergies. He is infected, Rom. Whatever the new variant is, he has it. Yeah, he looked, he looked sick. Hey, Russ, are you buying into this bullshit? I don't know, man. He told us that he's got allergies. Why would he lie to us? He's our family. That's why we're here. No, we're here because you two brought us in the middle of fucking nowhere. No, we were trying to do something nice for someone. It was someone's birthday. No hospital. Don't turn it around to something that it wasn't. Symptoms include hallucination, coughing, and dry mouth. (DEEPENED VOICE) You're all going to die. This is probably the safest place that we could be. It's the safest place? No hospital, no pharmacy, no internet reception? No fucking people. No disease. No virus. I'm not dying because of your lack of leadership. [arguing] What you wanna do? It's OK. You were sick. Hey, knock it off. We did not come this far to watch us fucking have a mental breakdown. We need to take a deep breath and figure out our options. You saw Lou. How did he look? When I saw Lou last night, he did not look good. When you talked to Lou, was he sick or not? I'm not a doctor, but I would say that Lou is sick. I'm sorry to say, his symptoms are in line with the new strain. Guys, the only sensible thing to do is to get Lou out of this house. I agree. Excuse me. I agree. You heard what the CDC said. There's some crazy stuff going on outside. Yeah, I heard what they said. He's staying here. And you're going to decide that for everyone? You're damn right. How is that fair? Maybe you're sick. How about that, Michael? Maybe you have to go. I don't feel sick. [arguing] Hey, guys. Kimmy, what are you doing? I'm-- I'm leaving. You can't go now. Listen, I have space in the back if anyone wants to come and join me. Fuck. Have you seen the news? No mask is going to protect you from that. The air is contaminated. People are dying outside, Kimmy. My son is at home with this babysitter. I can't even get through to her. I have to be at home with my son. They said you can't go outside. It's not-- Benny, Benny, people, if she wants to go, let her go. She's got a kid at home. My gosh, she's got kid at home you cannot go out there like that. What choice do I have? It's not safe. You don't know what you're up against. Just-- That's my son. And you would do the exact same thing. It doesn't make any fucking sense. I love you. I love you all. Just be safe. You're just going to let her go? Baby, she has a kid, baby. Come on. No, we-- we can't just let her go. We have to let her go, B. It's poison out there. You can't risk it. All of this is crazy, bro. How do we know that we're not infected? Because we're not sick, Russ. Because we're fine. We're fine. How do you know that we're fine? The CDC said the symptoms of paranoia and hallucination. I know I am not the only one that's seeing things in this lodge. [scoff] I've been seeing things too. What? What did you see? It's not important. Maybe you just need a little rest. I saw some shit. [coughing] Sorry. [gasp] I'm fine. It's asthma. It's asthma. Serena, you know it's asthma. Serena? I just-- my inhaler. Serena, you know it's Bianca. She's got asthma. Can you help her out? - All right, yeah, yeah. This is what we need to do. You guys get her upstairs, let her get a little bit of rest. Guys, we're in this together. Guys, do not let this break us apart. Let's not lose control. All right, all right, all right. You're going to lie back here. [gasping] Go on. Deep breath. [coughing] Hope Kimmy makes it. [gasping] Bianca, do you think you're sick? No. OK. Wait, get my bag for me. Yeah. You're pregnant. When did you find out? Three weeks ago, maybe. You know, I-- I just knew. [giggle] Does Rom know? No. OK. I-- I mean, there's so much going on. I haven't found the right time, I guess. I don't know. And then he's just not here, it feels like. [coughing] [knocking] Hey Lou, how are you doing? Everybody lost their minds over this virus. Think I'm infected, huh? I'm not dumb. And Michael coming up here trying, trying to figure me out. He's paranoid. We're paranoid. And everybody thinks they're a doctor all of a sudden. I think maybe we all have it. Hey, listen, man, I told you, on my life, I quarantined two weeks before this trip. It's my allergies, you know? I already gave y'all the God's honest truth. I know you did, Lou. I would never doubt you. Looking for a tarp, tape, anything we can block windows up with. [coughing] (SOFTLY) Fuck off. Yo, it's kind of creepy down here. Benny, Benny, come on, huh? [muffled speech] [jiggling] Yo, Mike. What? Come here. Looks like something back here. Hold on, watch out. [click] We're going to figure a way out of this. Yeah, we always do. Since eighth grade, right? Yeah. Listen, well, when I look in your eyes and I see the look in her eyes, I could tell you found the one, bro. Don't fuck this up. You know we came here for a show, man. So before this weekend's over, there better be fireworks. You understand me? I'm going to get it done, Lou. Don't be afraid of commitment. [coughing] You don't want to be like me, coming home to an empty house every night, no kids, no woman, no one to take care of you. Fear is a choice. Don't believe in it. All right? Now, be out. I'll be much better after I get some rest. Go tell them that. [jiggling] Yo, Mike, come here? What you got there? I don't know. About to find out. It's got to be stuff behind it. [banging] [grunt] [clicking and buzzing] I'm so glad you guys are here. Me too. What? It's probably an allergic reaction, right? Not a symptom. OK, enough about me. You want me to get you something for your stomach? Some tea? Yeah. Why is there a bed down here? It's fucking weird. It's an old lodge, isn't it? Lots of shit down here. There's no windows here, is there? No. So no ventilation to the rest of the house. Did you get a hold of Kim yet? No, I've called. I've texted. It just goes to voicemail. Maybe she doesn't have reception. I don't know. [suspenseful music] [shaky exhale] [shatter] Bianca. [gasp] What? What? Oh. What? My necklace, I must have dropped it in here. I just had it. Have you seen it? No, no, I don't think you had it on. No, I wear my necklace all the time, Bianca. Calm down immediately. No, I literally just had it. Why are you looking at me like I'm sick? It's a rash from an allergic reaction. Just calm down. Just had my necklace and now it's gone. [door slams] [labored breathing] Hey, hold this for a second. Are those empty bottles of that shitty wine we had? Yeah, Russ. Fuck. What you got down there, Benny? Looks like some old chest, [muffled speech].. I don't see anything good, man. Russ, Hold up a second. "Believing what you fear will bring to the victim what they are afraid of." This is it. MICHAEL: Upstairs room isn't sealed. Obviously, not waterproof. Lou, I know he's your friend, but he is sick. There's a room down here. We can easily put him in there. There's no ventilation to the rest of the house. We can get food and water down to him. I don't want to get sick. What is this? Benny, can I talk to you real quick? [muffled speech] Hey. Rom. What? I'm sorry. I'm listening. Are you? Yeah, I promise. Something's wrong. Listen. I don't know what it is. Babe, listen to me. Last night when I couldn't sleep, I ended up running around the house. And I ended up in the basement when I found these photos and books. And-- you got to listen to this. "Seeking those of light and sourcing fears from each soul for fear and faith are the same." We are trapped. You hear me? We're in this weird ass lodge in this weird ass town in the middle of nowhere. We can't go outside. You guys saw the news. We have no idea what this mist will do if we walk into it. And I'm not trying to die being a character in one of Rom's books. The way we're going to go down is from the inside out. And the only person that's showing symptoms right now is Lou. So here's what we're going to do. We're going to put Lou down here in this basement. Do you hear yourself? I know. Lou is my best friend. I love Lou more than anybody here. We need to bring Lou to this basement. And we need to lock that motherfucking door until we can figure this shit out. Listen to yourself. We're going to put him down here in a basement? It will only be for one night. Lou would do the exact same to us if he had to. We've got to look out for the girls and we've got to look out for the group. You mean you got to do what's best for yourself? Mike, you with me? Benny you in? Benny, look at me. Are you in? And what if he don't want to come? If it's between him and us, we're going to make him come down here. Let's go. Come on, Benny. Look at this place. Look at these women. This is the lodge where they were tortured and killed. I don't know what is up with you in this freaky, crazy obsession that you have. But you need to listen to me. I'm listening. No, you're not. I've been trying-- I've been trying to tell you something for the last two weeks. Tell me? What could you possibly tell me that I haven't heard in the past two weeks? I'm pregnant. [wheezing breaths] Breathe. It's going to be OK. I want to go home. [snoring] Lou, Lou. What's up? Lou, come with us. [coughing] Come with us downstairs. What you talking about, come to you downstairs? Rom needs our help, man. What do you mean, he need help. Rom needs-- Rom needs help. Rom got hurt, Rom. Rom from hurt? For what? What you have? How? He was moving stuff around in the basement. He hurt himself. He needs our help downstairs now. Rom needs our help, man. [coughing] Oh, can't really be sick. [chatter] Right in. Follow me. It's all right, just follow me. I got you . Bro, I got you. He needs you. How did he get down here? He's here. He needs you. Just come on, man. Where you at, bro? This way. Rom! [coughing] Where he at? Go. [grunting] What are you doing? What y'all doing? [arguing] You're sick. [arguing] Ah! [labored breathing] Fuck off me, man. [arguing] This is what we're doing, Russ? [banging] Open the door. Open this door, Russ! I'll be infected. His own blood infected me, man. I don't wanna fucking die. Yo! Just making-- Just get you upstairs. Hold on. [speaking simultaneously] Russ, it's OK. I'm scared. I don't wanna die. Let's get you upstairs. Please. Goddamn, man. Please. I don't wanna fucking die like this, man. [clattering] I know you ain't going to leave me in here. [labored breathing] All right, sit down. Ready? We need to stop the bleeding. And we need to clean him up. I'll get something to clean it maybe and something to put on the wound. This side, this side. [grunt] Put the towel. Put the towel. Russ, put pressure on it! [grunt] Aw, shit, man. What the hell is happening? Get out. No, no, no, no. Get out! Babe. What happened? Babe, I'm sorry. Keep pressure on it. We just tried to put-- OK, here. --Lou into the basement real quick so that he wouldn't get us all sick. Basement? We just didn't want him to get everybody sick. You understand that, right? It just went down. This is going to hurt. This is going to hurt. Ah. What were you thinking? [coughing] Keep it covered. No, you can't touch me. Baby, I'm not going anywhere. Baby, hold on, back away from me right now. [banging] Open this! [jangling] [coughing] [heavy breathing] [banging] Open this door! I'm not leaving you. Babe, getting you sick would be worse than dying. OK? Baby, please. I can't go. Go lay down in that bed right there. I don't wanna. Tomorrow morning, as long as I don't have no symptoms, we'll get in the car, one way or the other, and we're going to get the fuck out of here. You hear me? Do you trust me? I love you. I love you. Now go. Meg! Wait. What happened? I'm sorry, man. We just-- I don't know what happened to me, bro. Fuck. You know I love Lou, right? [hushed whispering] I'm sorry. You know I would never try to hurt him. We just-- we just didn't want him to get everybody sick. Between this lodge and the virus, man. I'm going fucking crazy. Bro, you don't understand, man. Something got into me. You believe me, right? You know I would never do that to him, right? I know. I'm going to go downstairs. And I'm going to get Lou. And I'll be back. Tell Lou I'm sorry, man. I'll be back. Get Lou out of there, man. [sobbing] Russ does not look good. We've got to get him some help. There's got to be a landline here somewhere. I'm going to go down to the front. I'm going to get a hold of the cops. We can't stay here like this. Get Lou out of that basement. OK. OK. How is Russ? What the fuck were you thinking? What was I thinking? I'm thinking, shit, Lou is sick. We should put him where he can't get other people sick. That's what I'm thinking. No, Michael, you were only thinking about yourself. Now show me where you put him. Now! [creaking] [buzzing] [hushed whispering] What the fuck? What? Somebody in here? UNIDENTIFIED VOICE: (WHISPERING) They don't trust you. Sick. You may as well come out now. UNIDENTIFIED VOICE: (WHISPERING) You're sick. What's that? What the-- UNIDENTIFIED VOICE: (WHISPERING) They said you're sick. They say you're sick. They don't trust you. They don't trust you. [echoing] They don't trust you. They say you're sick. [creaking] UNIDENTIFIED VOICE: (CROAKING) They don't believe you. [groan] [grunting] [buzzing] [grunting] [growl] [grunting] Ugh. Ah! Ugh! Ugh! Ah! No! [clicking and buzzing noises] [dial tone] [beep] RECORDING: We are experiencing technical difficulties at this time. Please leave a message and we will return your call-- What the fuck were you thinking? He's going to be pissed off. Just make sure he doesn't fucking hit me. Why would he do that? What the hell is this? What language is that? Oh, my god! What is this? [beep] No one's been here for eight years? [water running] FRIEND: She's scared. We should have been done already. We all did it. Got to do it. Do it. Sh. Ah! [screaming and gurgling] She looks like she's dying. You look like you're dying. [laughter] You look like you're dying. [gasping] Ah! [water softly running] Why would he fucking do that? Why would he fucking do that? Why would he fucking do that! Hey, Michael? What did he fucking do that? It wasn't him. Why would he fucking do that? It wasn't him! Michael, we-- This is my fucking fault. We've all lost something, Mike. [static] [sound skips] Rom? [crash] [shatter] [crash] [shatter] [crash] [crash] [crash] [shatter] [labored breathing] Ah! [hyperventilating] No, no, it's OK. It's me. It's me. You're OK. You're OK. You're OK. We got to go. We've got to get out of here, OK? Come on. We're going to get your medicine and get out of here. Let's go. We have to go. We got to go. I'm going to get the others. [dripping] Ah! [gasping and grunting] Mike! Mike! Mike! [heavy breathing] [grunt] [creepy music] MAN (ON RECORDING): A warning sign. Russ? [muffled speech] Russ? [muffled speech] [music playing] (SINGING) Yet I wonder-- Russ? [music playing] [muffled echoey singing] Russ? (STRAINED WHISPER) Mike, can you see her? [crunch] RUSS: (STRAINED WHISPER) Oh, god. She's there. Oh, god! [hyperventilating] Ah! Oy, oy, no, no, no, no, ah, ah, ah. [panting] [whimpering] [buzz] Ah! Help! Get me out of here! Ah! [sawing noise] [crunch] [relative quiet] [panting] No, no. Let me out! Let me out! Let me out! Let me out! Let me out! Let me out! Let me out! Let me out! Let me out! Let me out! [banging] [squishing noises] [creak] [muffled speech] What is going on? [panting] Babe? Serena? [boom] [hushed whispering] OFFICER 1: Shut up! OFFICER 2: Show me your hands. I want to see your hands right now. [siren] [beep] [hushed whispering] [radio chatter] [chuckling] [click] You're OK. Small breaths, come on. Sit down. [wheezing] Sit down. It's not the virus. It's the lodge. Las brujas del miedo. What? ROM: It means the witches of fear. And they're using our fear to kill us. We got to get out of here now. BIANCA: I can't go out there. I'm so scared. We have to leave now. Yeah, you're OK. No, no, no, no, I've been seeing things out there. I don't want to go out there. I don't want to do it. [boom] [gasp] OK. Everyone's dead. What? Everyone-- Michael, Meg, Russ, all dead. Everyone is dead. Everyone is dead. There's something-- there's something going on in this lodge. I see the pictures of us, right? All, all the pictures are blurred except for who's in this room right now. I see Meg's picture. Her face is blurred. I go find Meg. She's dead, OK? I'm seeing the words. I see, "no light Tamara." At the bottom of the painting, the numbers 4-1-9. What does that mean? Nolite, nolite, timere. Nolite timere, it's Latin. Nolite timere. It means, don't be afraid. OK, yes, OK, so, so, what is it for 4-1-9? Is the 4-1-9 code for do not be afraid? What does the 4-1-9 mean? It's a scripture. What is-- a scripture of what? Scripture? 4-1-9, 4-1-9, 4-1-9, 4-1-9, I've seen that. I've seen that number too. Last night, when I told you that story about the witches and the miners and the lodge-- The witches? --where they were brought to be tortured. That's here. This is the lodge. What the fuck are you talking about, Rom? There are places all over the world that are portals for evil. What are you talking about? What does that have anything to do with what's happening right now? I'm trying to tell you. Each one of these portals has what is called a gatekeeper whose only purpose is to feed the portal souls, souls like us. And they consume our souls to give themselves eternal life and to keep the portal alive. The witches I told you about last night? They live in these portals. Las brujas del miedo. What? It means the witches of fear. You've lost your fucking mind. The woman that was downstairs that checked us in, she's like a gatekeeper? Yes. Did you know this before you brought us here? ROM: I thought it was just a story, Serena. You thought it was just-- I didn't know. I was just trying to research my book. Why would you bring us here? I didn't know. But what I do know is that they are feeding on our fear. And everything that we are seeing, everything that we are feeling, I don't believe it's real. So everything we're seeing isn't real? It is if you believe it. And if you believe it, it will kill you. Babe, what are you doing? We have to get out of here now. Just give me a minute, OK? Give me a second. This is on you. Our friends are dead because of you, Rom. I'm sorry. Isaiah chapter 41 verse 9. I have taken you to the ends of the Earth. From the farthest corners, I called you and not rejected you. So fear not, for I am with you. But I have chosen me and not cast thee away. You guys-- We've got to get out of here. Come on. [bang] [panting] [squirting noise] Ah! [hyperventilating] UNIDENTIFIED VOICE: [non-english speech] [banging] [quiet] I think it's over. [crash] Ah! ROM: Benny, it's OK. It's not real. What's that? It's real. It's not real. We're manifesting fear. We have to take a chance and go outside. WITNESS (ON TV): The disease is way more severe than anyone could have actually imagined. Oh my god. Let's go. WITNESS (ON TV): I cried out. And no one heard me. And I was trying to get help. [creak] [panting] [crying and hyperventilating] It's OK. You're OK. You're OK. We've got to go. We got to take our chances outside. Come on. We just got to run. Sh. Put this on. Don't breathe until we get to the car. [boom] Ah! [hyperventilating] Ah! We have to go get her. Hell no. You're crazy. Don't go down there. What y'all doing? Stop! Serena? Serena? [radio chatter] [siren] [radio chatter] [crying] Serena. What's up, man? OFFICER: Step out of the car. You know I ain't do nothing. You ain't got to shine the light in my face. I didn't do nothing. [siren] OFFICER: I said, get out of the car now. What ya'll doing, man? I said I ain't doing nothing. I'm just driving home. Man, I ain't do nothing. Serena. Oh, god. [roar] Ah! [yelling] [panting] Serena? No, no. ROM: Serena, what's happening? We've got to go! Serena, Serena, Serena, whatever you're seeing, it's inside your head. Help! ROM: It's not real. BIANCA: Serena! [speaking simultaneously] ROM: Don't believe it. [panting] Help! [crash] [sobbing] Help! ROM: Serena, we're here. Come to us. [grunting] ROM: We're here. [whimpering] [muffled speech] Ah! Ah! Ah! [yelling] Benny! Benny! [grunt] BIANCA: What-- what? [panting] Oh, my god. Benny. Baby, keep going. We've got to go. I told you I didn't do nothing! I'm sorry. I'm s-- We need to get out. Let's go. I'm sorry. Benny, what did you do? I had to. [grunting] [grunting] BIANCA: Don't do it, Benny. Benny, no! [hushed whispering] BENNY: Ah! Ah! Ah! [crying] I can't feel my legs. We have to go. We have to go. [chittering noise] Bianca, I'm sorry. You know you can't beat it physically. You have to beat it mentally. You can beat this thing. Don't lose your faith. I love you. Now go. [panting] [crash] Ah! [gasp] [grunt] [hushed whispering] [chittering and chirping] [action music] [panting] [birds cawing peacefully] [birds chirping] [panting] ROM: (FADING VOICE) Bianca, it's not real. [gasp] [boom] Oh! Oh! [chaotic noises and fighting] [chittering] Ah! [growling] [gasp] [choking noises] [wheeze] [panting] [whimpering] [scream] Come on, you can do it. Use your faith. [scream] It's taken you to the ends of the Earth from the farthest corners and I've called you. I will strengthen you and help you. I called you and not rejected you. So fear not, for I am with you. Do not be dismayed. For I am your god! [screams] BIANCA: And hold, my richest hand. Praying with you. Do not be deceived, for am I you god. [screaming] BIANCA: [hushed whispering] For I am with you. [splat] [thud] [thud] [ominous music] [panting] [haunting choral music] [quiet sounds] [buzz] [chime] [buzz] [chime] [buzz] [chime] [buzz] [chime] [shaky exhale] [MUSIC - CLIPPING, "SAY THE NAME"] (SINGING) Oh, that shit is on. Let me drop some shit like this here. At night, I can't sleep. I toss and turn. Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned. Four walls just staring at a nigga. I'm paranoid sleeping with my finger on the trigger. REPORTER (ON TV): On the scene there, another terrible story today as WRLA's Brian Mann brings us the latest on who died. Polive have spent hours-- Police have spent hours of Sunday investigating-- [yelling] LOU (THROUGH DOOR): Let me out! Let me out! Let me out! [muffled speech] [door creaks] [door shuts] [creepy music] [hip hop music] (SINGING) Fear. Fear exists in the mind. Everybody afraid of something. Everybody got religions of their own kind. Everybody prayed for something. And I got to hold it down for me and mine out here. I can't play with nothing but stay with your scary ass in the house. Think better thoughts. If you need to save your buddies, just whip it, man. Somebody pinch me. I had a dream. I had a dream. Everything played out. And my real life was something I seen. Something I seen. I'm just trying to get all that out my thoughts, but it won't leave. Somebody scream. I'm the only one right now that's in this house, but I hear screams. This is real life. No, this ain't for thing for TV. It can't be televised. Every day a gamble. You get up and roll the dice. You never know what's waiting for you on the other side, on the other side. I can see it in their eyes that I'm something that they fear. Homie caught his first body, but he did it out of fear. Survival of the fittest don't mistake quietness. Fear. Claim you ready for the smoke with no, all I see is-- fear, fear. You know I'm traumatized. When I hear the front door, you can see it in my eyes. You ever felt like that close. The only thing I know, is you shouldn't trust the soul. Probably the saints say. When I still living with my mama, I left the crib at 17. If I don't say my prayer at night, I have a bad dream. Penitentiary chances, hope I don't go to the bing. Riding around in the traffic with a thumper when I sling. I'm hoping somebody hear me so it don't fall on deaf ears. I'm out here with the snakes and the snake my biggest fear. I ain't trying to speak it into existence. Hope I make myself clear. But please provide me with some assistance sometime. I think death is near. This is real life. No, this ain't for TV. It can't be televised. Every day a gamble. You get up and roll the dice. You never know it's waiting for you on the other side. On the other side. This is real life. No, this ain't for TV. It can't be televised. Every day a gamble. You get up and roll the dice. You never know what's waiting for you on the other side, on the other side. Zip code, no shoes, marble floors. Bitch tip toe. Floatsies with your bitch at the Crypto. Yeah. Bunny rabbit did grow. Who's that peeping in my window? Got me-- Tip toe, sing. Let you slide. Finna wrap them up in plastic, just another homicide. And I drop them off like axes, but you ain't no friend of mine. And I can't trust them, nothing. This is real life. No, this ain't for TV. It can't be televised. Every day a gamble. You get up and roll the dice. You never know what's waiting for you on the other side. On the other side. I can see it in their eyes that I'm something that they fear. Homie caught his first body, but he did it out fear. Survival of the fittest, don't mistake quietness. Fear. Claim you ready for this smoke, but no, but all I see is fear, fear. One-- take a minute to kick it with me. Let's talk about what you're afraid of. You're aware that fear is something that only exist in your mind. So what you made of? They're afraid of my growth. Majority shit you see is made up. I put all my faith in my god and make sure we talk every time I wake up. Like, listen, Lord, I ain't no angel, but, nigga, with feelings, Lord. A good nigga with a good heart. Did everybody trying to turn it to the Lord. And I know that me having faith is the first step I gotta take. The mean hitter, Lord. So forgive me, Lord as I put on these black gloves and kill these niggas, Lord. Fear. [haunting choral music] [vocalizing]
