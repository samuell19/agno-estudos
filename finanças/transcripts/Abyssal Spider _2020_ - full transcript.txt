The sea is rough. Grip it harder. Be careful, everyone. Be careful! Jie. You should not be here. You leave your wife alone when she is giving birth? What are you doing? I'm here to save people. Same as you guys, I rushed to here after I received the emergency call. Jie, You're such a good man! We are the rescue team. Rescue team. Look ahead! Pay attention to the safety. Strive for the time. The sea is rough. We're close to the ship. Pay attention to the safety. How dare you use my ship to transport the nuclear waste. It is too close to the city. Don't you know that it will pollute the area? We've done this several times. It was fine. We thought you knew about it. Nobody could predict this. Captain doesn't know, me either. No one knows. It is not our fault. Jie, you go first, others keep up with you. Don't worry. Where is Jie? Jie. You don't need to worry. We are going to rescue you. Be carefai, Jie! Someone is drowning. Help him first! Pull him up. Captain! Listen, we can't die here. -Let's go together. -Move faster. I'll stay. You should leave now. -Why you... -Hurry up! Captain. Hurry up. ï¼¯ne left behind here.

We come here not to watch you die. Go! Jie! Jie, we are running out of time. Captain, come with us! -It's dangerous for us if we don'd leave now. -You shoud leave. -Captain, the clock is ticking now. -Leave! You all go now. -Captain. -Go. It's a good position. -Let me down. -It's a good position. Come with me! -No, there is still one person on the ship. -Come. Jie, why don't you follow what captain Ding says? We need team work, okey? We can't leave the captain here alone. We can't abandon him so easily. But, we are running out of time, okey? Leave now, everyone leave! Go. Hurry up! Go. Hurry up! Faster. Take care of yourself. Okey, I will. Go down here. Be quick. Catch up the time. We are the rescue team. I can't leave the captain here. Jie, don't forget you have wife and child. You don't think for yourself, please think for them. Give me 10 seconds. Just 10 seconds. I am the team leader, follow my order! Give me a chance to save him Go away. Captain Ding. -Jie, go now! -Captain Ding. -Go. -Release me! -There's no time. Let's leave. -Let go of me. Come and help! Here! Jie, comes here! Are you alright? Where is Captain Ding? I... I don't know. I don't know. I... Where is Captain Ding? I... Where is Captain Ding? I...I don't mean to do that. I don't mean to do that. -Why? - I don't mean to do that. Why? -You are so impulsive. -I just want to save people. You never follow the order and... Captain Ding! Come up here. Captain Ding! Jie, Help me! Jie, Help me! Are you leaving? There are still some times on the clock. Don't you want to touch me? I will come again. What happened to this guy? He was once a good young man. And now he becomes a shit. Many years ago, he worked as a volunteer to save other people lives at sea. It's said that he initiated an accident because of being too impulsive. The team leader died because of him. And also, his wife got a dystocia at the same time. It was too late for him to be back. He didn't have the chance to say goodbye to her. Hey man, take it easy! Oh, forget it! I am the team leader, follow my order! Give me 10 seconds. Just 10 seconds. Jie, we have no time. Captain Ding. Let's go! Leave now. Let go of me. Why you always follow your impulse? You know, other people die because of you. Yeah! Mahjongg! Nine bamboos. Take it and buy some pills. Why don't you keep you mouth clean? You, such a trouble maker dad! Your daugher is so unlucky. What the fuck are you talking about? What do you mean my daugher is unlucky? Stop fighting! Pull them apart You say it again! Stop fighting! Dad, welcome home. Have you finished your dinner? Not yet. Juan, what are you drawing? I am drawing us. What happened to your face? Dad accidentially hit my face on something. Nothing. You promised to mom you never start gambling anymore. But, you forget again. Come here. Come here. Sit down, please. Dad will work harder and earn more money. I will give you a better living. Come. Drink until you drunk. Earn more money. Good luck for us! Drink! Captain. Cheers Let's enjoy the meal. Hey! Rookie. Don't do that. Here you go, Bald Head. Brother Ding. This soup tastes great. Jie, finally you come here. I haven't seen you for a long time. Come here and sit on it, try our hot pot. Come on. I have no appetite now. Are you full? We are famiy, let's sit down and start to eat. You all are ... -Let's drink. -Brother Ding , Cheers! Dad. What are you calling me? Captain. I need to earn more money. Please count me in this time, okey? Are you qualified? Do you think you are qualified as a seaman? You look at your damn outlook. Look more like a ghost than a human being. I don't know why my girl will fall in love with you. My dear grandchild Xiao Juan. You should bring her to the city as soon as possible. She won't be successful if she stays here. Don't you know? I will not sent her away. Juan, She... Juan, when she almost leave, I have promised to her I will take care of our child. You still dare to say that? How? What thing can you give to her and take care of her? A bottle of beer? Huh? When she needs you most, where are you? You leave her alone! -Brother Han. -You can't even rescue your own wife! Don't say that. -What kind of man you are! -Brother Han, stop it. Rescue other people? Everything is in the past. Okey? Jie. He used to be a good guy, right? -Right? -Yes. He becomes a shit simply because of the same thing you suffered. He is a worthless seaman I know. If he really wants to have another life give this young man a second chance. Captain Han, let's toast. Okey. Xiao Tu, dinner time! Listen to me, you bring Xiao Guan to her grandma's house. Someone will take care of her. And you, Get ready for the journey. Prepare for everything. In addition, I will let you on board this time, you better work harder. Or you wait to see what I will do to you. Thanks Captain. Johnny. Give this to him. Brother Han. He's down and out. will he be a burden to us? Tell me about it. Shut Up! Hey, Jie. Hey. Our boss asked me to give it to you. Take it. Even if you don't think of yourself, you should think of your daughter. Hey... He's already in a bad mood. Let's go back. Don't bother him. That guy... Whatever... Move to the back. Let's pray to MaZu. I hope during this journey, the weather is favorable, everyone is safe, and make a fortune. Be careful. What the ... You really embark the ship! -I would just like to know. -Who will be cursed to death this time. -Tai, I'm... -Don't talk to me like that! You better pay more attention. Don't let me find out you did something wrong. Wash the deck! Isn't it funny? Take it. Brother Ding, I wanna know... Why a fisherman feels dizzy on a fish boat? How long haven't you work on a ship? Let me tell you one thing, Uncle Han permit you to be on board making me in lack of one man power. Don't drag us down. I am sorry. Captain. Look! This typhoon is coming closer and closer. If our ship sails straight into it, I don't thinkg we can make it. But if we choose to return now, it will be a total lost. What should we do now? Actually, this time when we sail off, we are targeting to the distant sea. Because all the fishes lives near to the shore are heavily polluted. And, do you know, we haven't paid all the debt yet for this vessel? What?! How comes we haven't paid all the debt yet for this broken vesesl? Brother Han. I told you that will get happen but you don't listen. For the sake of everyone on this fishboat, we should not only focus on fishing, but also help to devlier some...parcels. But, you are too stubborn. You don't do anything, you don't listsn to me. Okey. Now, everyone can't make the living! Brother Han. Just listen to me once, okey? Let's make a fortune this time. Only fishing? How much time we need to pay all the debt? Ding. Don't forget that. We have our own rules and principles. Principles. Can these "principles" give us a bowl of rice to eat? "Principles" means nothing to me. I want to earn money in this journey. It is meaningless to me no matter what you said. Have you finished? Don't do something stupid. Captain Han. It is not I that don't respect you. But, we need to earn our livings. Ding, stop it. Our captain will not allow your messy business take place here. Let's listen to our captain. Work hard and act responsibly this time. We focus on fishing. Okey? Hey. How about my place? Why don't you play cards with them? I don't like to play cards. So, you are the new comer? The one who vomits a lots? Yes, that's me. I am the chef working downstairs. You can visit me if you are bored. I can give you several pieces of ginger. You should eat some and then you won't feel dizzy. My name is Xiao Tu. Jie. How do you do? Do you need to wash your hands? I am hungry. Prepare a bowl of noodle for me. Alright. I have to work now. Hey. Here you go. Act fast! I am hungry! Hold on. Turn around. You're not allowed to go up on the deck Say it again! I'm not allowed to go DOWN the deck. You never understand why I told you not to walk upstairs, every time! He's my nephew. Brother Ding. What did the Captain say? Have you realized in these days, the rainstorm is coming. What should we do? Han and Kong share the same idea. They just want to make a return voyage. It is because they don't want to bear any responsibility. I think I can't rely on them anymore. Oh! That's is absolutely not a good decision. We haven't make any money yet. -Yes. -We haven't started to earn money. I fell out with them just couple minutes before. Right now, we will follow the same route. But, please tell everyone to preapare for the best time to change our fate. We follow who leads us to the money, -Sure. -We will follow what Brother Ding say. We need to keep an eye on the captain's relatives and friends. We can't let them to ruin our big deal. Understood? -Sure. -I got it. The smell of the sea breeze, Is different from it in the past. Jie, I heard that you owe a lot of money. Is that real? Maybe you can grab this oportunity to join us. Let's say, referring to the parcels we are delivering this time, Brother Ding has already negotiated with the client. We'll share the money we earn this time. Of course, Brother Ding will get the largest share. Because he takes the highest risk. I think you have no problem on this, right? I just want to be a normal seaman. I haven't thought about this too much. And also, Uncle Han is my father in law. So, I think there is no need to give me a share. You have just ruined your chance of saving yourself from the disgrace. We look up to you simply because you are the son in law of uncle Han. -Someone can cover us up if anything goes wrong. -Don't you guys feel shame? So? You guys bullying me now, right? What are you pretending? I know you hate him too. None of your business. So, what's up? Three to one? Don't you feel ashamed? Now, it is three to three situation. Let's call it a day! Let's go. Mind your own safety. Thanks. You're such a lame now! It is not finished yet, between you and me What's up? How long can we last? Captain. The pump is leaking oil seriously. If this fishboat not having a through repair, it can't sail out next time. Hey. I have a bad news. We've got a situation. Everyone come here to have a look. Brother Ding , what happened? is this your first time aboard a ship? Brother Ding, what's happening? Don't block my way. Brother Han. You have to guard about Ding. He seems to be very ambitious. He will do everything just for the money. And, he has so many followers now. His heart is not in the right place. Don't worry. I bring Ding out. What he did, I always keep it in my mind. We got some fishes. We caught them! We got an excellent harvest. Congratulation, Captain. We got some fishes. I said don't worry. Act fast, open the door of the fish room. Tai, Look! So many of them. Hui Xiong, we're so lucky. Good! Everyone give me a helping hand to pull the net. Pull the net! Wow! -What's that? -What? Push it up! Quick. Push harder. -What's inside? -Don't make a fuss. Push the net up. Hairy crab? Take him back! Hurry up! There Why it's gone? what the fuck is that? Is your leg ok? Still feeling pain? Is it a spider or a crab? Nope. Jie, -you go and have a look. -He's bleeding a lots. Why you always pick on him? If he doesn't go, I go. It's all done. I go. Be cautious. Don't worry. Tai. Don't say that I haven't give you a chance. It is ridicolous to have such a giant spider inside the deep sea. Are you a fool? Is this the first time you embark a fishboat? You are afriad of this? One, two, three, go! Go check the net. It is so disgusting to see Jie on the same boat Be patient. And we need to find a chance to deal with him. Why are you only focus on the thing in front of you? How can I know that? Please don't only pick on me. I think we need to have a long discussion. Think about your daughter, okey? Tai. Tai, are you okey? Are you OK? At this moment, why you still thrifty on these things? Quick! Get up! Get up! Go Help! What happens? Pull him back! Quick! -He is being pulled away. -Help! Pull him back. Catch it! Catch it! Save him! What's that? Bother, are you alright? How this could happen? How's everything? Are you ok? Did you get hurt? -Come inside and take a rests. -Don't panic. Where is the spider? Over there. Everyone be cautious. It runs over there. Stab it! It's there. Over there. Over there. Captain! Uncle Hans! Brother Han! Are you alright? Captain. Move! Catch it. We hit it! Was it fallen on the sea? Where is it now? Take a look at both sides. Is it dead? Everyone, no need to worry. I will talk to the captain. I'll ask him to pay double to all of you. Is that Okey? Deal. Nice Brother Ding. Then, you can go now. Go inside. Just go. Are you feeling alright? I am fine. Let's go. Was that a giant spider? I have been fishing for almost 30 years, and I have never seen such kind of monster. Tell me what you think. What is that? How come there are so many buckets? So many containers of nuclear waste? How come they are everywhere? Who is so thoughtless? Throw the waste everywhere. So.. the giant spider we just saw, Is it something generated by those nuclear waste? Let's handle the existing situation first. Bring me up. Are the fishses we just catched edible? Go. Brother Ding. The girls on the island we visited last time, they were so hot. Maybe we can bring them all to this island, after this journey. We didn't catch up the time last time. But, how about our parcels? What can we do now? Tai. What I am worry about is, the creature we catched last night. What is the name of this fucking monster? Mmm... I think you have already nailed it. Actually, no matter what is going on, my target is to earn a lots of money in this voyage. Or I will never leave this broken ship! Yes. Whatever Brother Ding said, we will follow you. Yeah! Brother Ding! You help Brother Chao once, and you will make a fortune. I think all of you know our captain's bad temper and stubborn attitude. He will not let us to use this ship for another purpose. So, you are afraid of him? You are such a dumbass, even worse than Jie. What are you talking about? You said I am worst than whom? What do you want to do? Hit me? Just hit me! You are not that "hard" on the bed. If you are really so powerful, bring back the money! And, then I will go with you. Deal. Count me in this time. Captain, bad news! Xiao Wang is in bad condition now. Get out of my way. What happened to him? He got a fever. Fever? Give him some pills. He vomits everything out. What is it? And, all the wounds are infected. I am afriad this may spread to other people. Bring him down to here. Hey Dude! Dude, how are you now? What? Hey Dude! Hey! Dude! Hold him up! Catch him! Catch him! Help! Be quick! Come and help me! Dude, no problem. Everything is ok, dude. Dude. Dude. Are you okey? Uncle Han. How to handle this situation? Treat it likes dealing with epidemic. Burn off. All walks of life shall become one with the earth. Ones who lives from the sea, shall return to the sea. Brother... Rest in peace. And may your soul keep us safe. Xiao Tu. Your culinary skill is getting better. Mmm. Hey. This is your bad habit. Come here. I can't stand it. Have you followed my instructions to drink more water? Thanks a lot. It is all of my faults I can only let you work here. At the bottom part of this broken ship, earn your living. But, I got some savings now. Sum up everything, including this time, after we get off the fish boat, I think you will have enough money to leave this village. Then you can wander around, seeing the outside world. Don't cry. Indeed, you just mention a point. You are really good for nothing! Hey, it is just a joke! Xiao Tu, it is overcooked! Uncle Kong. Uncle Kong. Uncle Kong. Captain is looking for you. Oh, Okey. Wow! It smells so good! Wow! You, get out of my way! What are you doing? Stop it, Bald head! -Let's go. -I am going! One bite costs nothing, right? Leave. Hui Xiong, you can do it! Hui Xiong, Zhong, come on! Next one. Brother Ding. We put our percels there, is that okey? Don't worry. The deck is under our control. I let everyone to keep an eye on it. Not big deal. Come on! Come on! Give it a try. Can you do this? You sucks. Come on! Come on! Zhong, you lost the fight with somone smaller than you? Hey Dude! Someone is there. Be cautious. Slow down. Go away. How are you? What happened to you? Tell me! Say something! You're going too far. What? It is none of your business. What are you doing, huh? Doing what? It is you again to do shitty thing on my ship? Captain Han, don't do that. Say sorry to Ding, be quick! I have done nothing wrong! Why I need to apologize? -What are you talking about? -Go away! You are a big boy now, huh? Buzz off! Leave. Okey, everything is ok now. Captain. She seems to be dehydrated. Drink some water first. Here you are. Have a mouthful of water. You can call me Xiao Jing. How come you are adrift on the open sea alone. Actually, I was with my friend. And, we encountered a shipwreck. Thanks for saving my life. I will report to the marine patrol about your friend is missing. No need to worry now. Dad. It is not me who started the fight. I have already changed my attitude, believe me. Do you know why I give you a punch? If I didn't do that, all of them will walk to you and hit you. Don't you think that Ding and his gangs are crossing the line? There are some hidden rules on my ship. If you talk like that to Ding, it's absolutely your fault. I told you before. In this journey, it will not be a peaceful one. Ding and his gangs will keep an eye on you. You need to be more careful. One more thing, call me captain on this ship! Captain. Xiao Jing. Are you feeling better now? Thank you. I am much better now. That's great. By the way, I would like to ask you... Do you still remember when you are falling from your vessel, what is the longitude and latitude figure? Sorry, I don't know anything about this. I only remember how long I have been drifting on the sea. Then, how about the name of your vessel? Or do you still remember what is the name of the port of departure? Look likes here. Are you sure? Yes. Captain, I really concern the safety of my friend. I don't know what is going on there. Can you bring me there? Okey. Please let me think about that first. All of you please leave me alone for a while. Okey. Thanks, Captain. Why are you here? Are you sent by Brother Chao ? Brother Chao ? You tell me how should we handle the parcels now. You can rest assured. Every man on this ship is under my control. But, what is the next step. You need to tell me right now. Go to the island. The island I just mentioned to the captain. Deliver all the goods there. I've already told him to do so but he was reluctant to change the route. You can persuade him for me. Don't play tricks on me! Now, this whole ship is under my control. You need to pay more attention for what you did on this ship from now on. Do you listen to me? Don't take advantage on me because yopu think I am only a girl. Good night. Brother Han. I would like to report one thing. After the rainstorm, we lose almost half of our food provisions. Also, there are some small holes on one side of the cabin. Our radio comunication system also need to be fixed. Apart from these three issues, every other things are running smooth right now. The fuel capacity is still more than enough. I would like to say it will be okey on the condition that there are no more accidents. We can still maintain the existing route and continue our voyage. Okey, you tell everyone. We need to pay more attention and don't make any mistake again. Brother Han. We've already lost our man. And, I frankly tell you one thing. This journey, I bring something here to exchange from money. I hope you don't mind that How dare you... How dare you did that illegal trade! Have you told me before? Have you told me you will let the dumbass Jie on board? He can't give us any help! And one more thing, Please don't think I am stupid. I've already known what you and Lao Kong did underneath. Hi. Hi. Thanks for your help today. It is good to hear that you feel better now. What's up? Watch out! You look so happy. I saw that you protect her a lots this morning. You want to date her in secret? Jie. You two should try to do "such thing" on this ship. I have did the same thing with my girl before. It was fantastic! What do you want to do? Hey, what are you two doing here? Hi, CE! Brother Ding asked us to fix the lighting system. Then, why are you still here? Run faster. Miss. There are so many single man here. You need to take more cautious on yourself. Don't wandering alone here anymore. Otherwise if something bad happens, We won't be responsible for that. Jie. You need to be more cautious. Captain. Xiao Jing is looking for you. Tell me what do you want to ask me. Captain, I would like you to do me a favor. Can you bring me to the island as soon as possible? It may take up to two days more. Before that, I need to fill up the fish tank first. You ask me again in 2 days, okey? -But I... -Xiao Tu, you take her downstairs now. I still have couple of things to work on. Okey. Come with me. Captain. Why are you here? Captain. All three engines are gone now. I already started the spare one first. What does Xiao Jing ask you to do? She asked me to bring her to the island. Have you promised her? Not yet. I think we need to think twice before taking any action. I can't image how a single girl drifting on the sea for several days but remains alive. And after she is being rescued, she seems to be very calm. In addition to this, every man on this ship is attracted by her appearance. But, she seems to be not nervous on that I really think she is not a simple girl as she told us. Captain. This girl asked you to send her to the island. Ding also asked you to do the same thing. How about you make use of this opportunity. This will help to leverage the conflict between Ding and you. Do you still rememebr what happened to Jie? Five years ago, One ship was turn over. It caused some nuclear waste falling into the deep sea. And no one visits there from that time onwards. How about this? Let me think once again and chew on. Don't come out if there is no big deal. Why? I think you are a girl, right? Damn. What are you talking about? I'm a girl, too. I can easily figure out the difference between a boy and a girl. You seems to be very young. You need to work very hard on a fish boat. And, it is full of men here. I am old enough. And the CE is my uncle. I live with him since I am just a little kid. He brings me with him everywhere and earn our livings. Let me tell you one thing, our captain is a good man. Don't just look at his outlook, he hides his virtue under the serious face. What you need to pay attention is Uncle Ding and his friends. They will do anything they can just for the money. Don't forget to lock you door. Hey. I can give my guarantee that I will not tell other people. I will keep your secret. Miss, took a shower. Hey. Do you know fresh water is the most expensive thing on a ship? Where are you going? No need to be scare of me, don't go away! Wow, you smell so good. Don't go, Miss. You guys should not harass a girl. None of your business! I don't want to make any trouble at this moment. So? You do not want to force me to do so. Actually, That's my intention! What do you want? Sheng, I have told you that you should not force me to do so. I would like to do that. Mind you own business, okey? Let's fight, come on! Don't force me! I have already told you not to force me to do so! Hey, what are you doing? What's the fuss? Everyone stops! Stop! Ding, why are you just looking at them and do nothing? Young men should do some daily training. Captain, why there is a woman on the ship! I was told she is Kong's nephew. What are you guys doing here? Are you okey? Xiao Tu. She is the relatives of our CE. If she wants to work on this ship, she needs to hide her identity. Everyone of us are suffering. Can we just give each other a little respect, is that okey? Go back to work now! Quick! Pack everything! Close it as fast as you can. Okey. Close it properly! Who's that? Brother Ding! Captain! Captain! Captain! What happened? What happened? What happened? How could this be? How could this happen? Why you are staring at me? Handle it now! Release him. Release him from the top, quick! Okey. Release him. Okey. Go. What are you guys doing here? I will tell you later tonight. Hui Xiong, let's go. Brother Ding. Brother Ding. I think you've already known that we need to restrict our food supply. Yes, we've already known that. You can get more of this. Thanks Brother Ding. You take all of them away later. I want to tell you that I think Uncle Han is too old, he doesn't have the courage to lead us to the island. We need to consider how to do it on our own. Do you have any idea now, Brother Ding? The girl said that she can lead us to the island and we will get our returns. Let's do what she wants and go where she likes. And, let's see what will happen next. If she really can lead us to the fortune, you and all of you don't touch her for now. Yes. But, eveyrone need to be well prepared. We need to take control of the whole ship in case we need to do so. Kong is a honest guy. And he knows how to control the ship. We don't make any plan on him right now. Got it. CE. Brother Ding is annoucing something, come in! Come with me. Well. There's no need. Nothing seriously. Kong. Sit here. I just come and try to get a glass of water. Come and sit. I think you already heard everything, right? Kong, if you are not a honest guy, and if you are not my friend for so many years, I've already thrown you to the sea and fed the fishes. Tell your little niece. Stay in the kitchen and don't make any trouble. Or I will ask Hui Xiong... Ding! I will follow you, provided that Xiao Tu is safe! Where is Xiao Bai? I told him not to wonder around. Brother Ding is looking for you. Be quick. Brother Ding. I have something to dicuss with you. What is that? I know that you can't get along well with Jie. You always want to give him a lesson. Brother Ding. Where are we going now? Brother Ding , do me a favor. Give Jie a chance. He will not make any trouble. Thank you, Ding. Go inside. -Just go inside. -What? Hey. Brother Ding. Open the door. Brother Ding , open the door. Tai. Tai. Why you got on board? Tai. Why you got on board? What are you doing here? Why do you get on this ship? Why do you get on this ship? Everything I did is for my daughter. How many people you would like to sacrifice? I didn't hurt anyone. You let the captain because of you. Who's the next? Why you get on this ship this time? Listen to me, please! We are in the same rescue team before. Every life is our responsibility. You said so many good words. Just tell me one thing. Who have you really saved? You even can't save your own wife. Tell me what have you saved? Not metnioned that you let so many people die because of you! You are a self-loathing drunker. Don't says anything about my wife. Do you really think I want to have this result? Are you an idiot? They just want to make you becomes a dead man. I am just acting in front of them. You now, stand up! I am already infected by the spider. -I am going to die very soon. -What? You still have your little girl waiting for you at home. What? You are not alone. Tai. You better have a full life! What are you saying? You still don't unerstand what I am saying? What are you saying? Did you hear me? What? The ship is stranding. Let's go upstair now. Go. Open the door. Ding. Open the god damn door. Stand firm, for your daughter, okey? Think about your daughter. It has been rusty. Here. Xiao Tu. Let me just look around and see whether I can find some tool. Try this. Nope, wait a while. We need to have a supporting point. Let me do it. Okey. Let me go down. Get up! This is the order! What? I am infected already. You need to live as long as you can. Help me to give a revenge on Ding. Protect your own daugter and yourself! Don't say any stupid words. Let me do it. We are the rescue team. We are the rescue team. Rescue team. Everything is ok. -Okey? - You take care of yourself. Tai. Tai. Tai. Tai. Tai. Jie. What happened to you? What happened? Tai is dead. What? Tai is dead. Everything is because of Ding. Don't be so implusive. -I will kill you! -Don't be so implusive. What! What do you want? I will kill you with my bare hands. Go to hell! Ding, I will kill you. I will take away your life. Why don't you open the door? What are you talking about? Actually, it is you who don't get along with Tai. You ask him to have a battle. Don't put the blame on me! You ask him out. You lock me up here. You must notice that the sea level is rising. We can't make it. Why don't you still not open the door? You are the one who bring bad luck. How many accidents happened after you embarked this ship? -You, ass hole! -What are you doing? Betrayer! Release them. Ding. On my ship, don't abuse lynching. -You are giving me a lecture now? -Don't move! You are now giving me a lecture. It's you and Kong let a female on board at first. This is the tradition. Now our ship is abandon by the gods already. Don't you know that? Ding, don't cross the line. Captain. What are you doing? Captain! Go inside! Go back. Go back now. What you guys think you are doing? But he is the captain. Are you rebelling? You talk too much. Say again. Aren't you great? Don't come closer Go now! Johnny. Chase after him. Run faster. Xiao Jing, give me some water. Captain! Are you okey? -And how about your wounds? -Thank you. I'm good. How are you? Thank you. Open the door now, open it! Let me see how long you can hide. Open the door. Uncle, I haven't seen Xiao Bai for a while. Hui Xiong has the courage to stab the captain now. I don't think Xiao Bai can make it. He applys for the marketing manager. You know that he is a fisherman before? Full of fishy smell. He is over confident. You shouldn't arrange every Tom, Dick and Harry to interview. Ridiculous. Hey. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. You, come here. Open the door. Hui Xiong. Hui Xiong. Xiao Bai. Xiao Bai. I don't intended to do so It is just an accident, Xiao Bai. It is an accident, Xiao Bai. I am not intended to hurt you. I am not! Trust me. It is really an accident. Xiao Bai. We have done so many things. Just tell me whether we can get the money or not. You are now not believing in Brother Ding? -Hello everyone. -Brother Ding. We are very close to the island now. Don't worry. We'll get our money soon when we arrive the island. Did you hear that? What's wrong? Qiang, you go up to check it out. Other people come with me. Go now. -Be careful! -What's that? What the fuck is that? How it becomes that thing? What happened? Brother Ding, where is Bald Head? -I don't know. -Where is he? How it becomes that thing? Who's screaming? I think it is not safety here. Leave now! Move! Brother Ding, the Spider! We lost one man again! Move! Mon... Monster! Hurry up! Open the door! -The spider is chasing us! -Open the door! We are family, sorry, please open the door! Open the god damn door! The spider is chasing us! Open the door! Should we open the door now? No way! We can't let them in. Maybe they will hurt us. Don't open the door, it is too dangerous. Open the door! We can't just leave them to die. We are really want to let them in? Open the door! Get out of my way. Go now! Close the door. Close it. Ding. Ding. What really happened outside? The monster is coming back. And this time it is even bigger. What the fuck are you doing? I told you to open the door, why don't you open it immediately? Have you did the same thing to me too? I let you come in, it is alreasy the best thing I can do. -What are you talking about? -Brother Ding Stop it. Get away from me. What's the fuck up? Stop fighting! Stop fighting! You just told us there is a monster outside? A monster is over there which look likes a giant spider. There are couple of pollution accidents in this region. But, this is the first time I heard a monster appear. How do you know? Mother nature will fight back. Human has already destroyed the ocean quite a long time. You guys should know that more than I do. Brother Ding. That's why we can't catch any fish recently. What should we do now? Who's blocking my way to the fortune, I will kill him. Even it's a monster. A Ding, do you still remember how Captain bring you in? You treat him like this is not acceptable. Is the money so important to you? Be cautious. The door is opened by someone. It is not safe anymore here, go! Go! Everyone go outside! Go. Go. Go. And take our parcel. Run Captain. Jie. You guys no need to worry about me. I am also a person living by the sea. My daughter is still waiting for me in our home. I will be ok. Run faster. Ciao, you go to the front attracting the attention of the spider. Hui Xiong, you go back and pick up all parcels and put them here. -Be quick. -okey. Why me? Why don't you go? It is the road to death. Who do you think you are, a captain? Why we must follow your order? We go to die, but you sit here and count the notes. What are you talking about? Since when can talk like this? Hui Xiong. Is it necessary to kill someone? What happened? Ciao. Don't touch him. The spider already gave him a bite. Why you are still here? Go inside now! Find a way to get our parcel. Xiao Tu, are you ok? -The spider. -What? Zhong. Keep an eye on her. Go. It runs away to the upper level. Hui Xiong, go and get the parcels now. Where is it? What the... Give it to me. Go back now! Move! Hui Xiong, go! -Close the door. -Jie! -Run faster. -Jie. Jie does not come inside yet! -Get out of my way. -What are you doing? Jie does not come inside yet! What are you doing? Brother Ding. You! You are ignoring me now, huh? You tell me that at this moment? Why you think I will not take care of you? What the hell are you doing? We are still outside, why you close the door? Calm down, you are still okey now, right? I already told you that he deserved to die. Why do we rescue him? Block the door. Run now. Fuck off. Stand up! Now! Uncle Ding, I know that you don't look liks that before. You talk too much. Run faster. Hide yourself now. It's ok. Spider's hearing is more sensitive than vision. Shh... Xiao Jing, you are right. If we do not make any noise, the spider will not come to us. Why are you starring at me? I hate Jie, not you. I will not save you. Do you know why I hate you so much? Do you still remember Captain Ding? Jie. You still got a wife and your kid. You don't think of youself, you should think of them. Give me 10 seconds. Just 10 seconds. I am the team leader, listen to me. Give me 10 seonds, I go and rescue him. Go away. Captain Ding. -Go now! -Captain Ding! -Jie, go now! -Captain Ding! -Let go of me. -Move! He is my younger brother. He should have a bright life. Because of the accident caused by your implusive action, you are a dumbass in these few years. The death of my brother doesn't seems to be valuable. Hui Xiong, Zhong, run! Brother Ding. Xiao Jing. You are not familiar with this ship. You help me to take care of our captain. Xiao Tu, follow me! Hui Xiong, Zhong. Hui Xiong, go and get the parcels. Zhong, we go to release the rescue boat. You still want to carry the parcels with us? I was almost dead but you don't care. I am now fully understand who you are. Let's discuss this later, okey? What are you doing? Hui Xiong. What the hell are you doing? Hui Xiong. Brother Ding. What should we do now? Forget it. Let him go. Zhong, you go to get the parcels and I release the rescue boat. I go by myself? I'm scared. I'm scared. -I'm really scared. -Where are you going? Let's go together. Go! Run faster! Xiao Tu Grab it! Shh... Brother Han, don't make any noise. Don't make any noise. Keep your mouth closed. No noise, please. It can hear us. I don't want to die here. I really don't want to die here. I don't want to die here. I really don't want to die here. Hey!

I am going to kill Xiao Tu. Oh! Please don't do that! Would you please don't do that? Please don't kill her. Let her go. Go away. Go away. It's useless to persuade me. I beg you to leave Xiao Tu alone. No one can hurt my Xiao Tu. I say don't hurt my Xiao Tu. I need to save her life. No one can hurt Xiao Tu. You are done. I will fight till I can not. No one can hurt my family. No one can hurt my family. Uncle. What happened? Xiao Tu. Uncle is still useful, right? You will not say I am useless anymore now? No, never! I'm sorry. Oh! It hurts! Hold on! Don't be afraid. I am your uncle. I will protect you forever. Okey, uncle. Hold on! You can make it! I feel so cold now. -Uncle. -I'm cold. Uncle. Uncle. Uncle. Wake up now! Wake up!

All parcels are fine. Pack them now. Be quick! Pack them all inside. All of them! Even at this moment, you still only concern about the parcels? I join this journey because of money. But our lives are more important. Why? Our lives are in danger? Haven't you seen that it is such a big vessel died on this vessel? Do you really think that you can simply run away with your goods getting on the rescue boat and leaving in secret without any difficulty? Let me tell you. If you want to be alive, we only have one choice now. You and me, And those also survived. We cooperate with each other to kill the giant spider. Do you understand what I said? Have you finished? I am here. I am here. HERE! I am not afraid of you. Come on. It's coming. Here. Get it down the fish room. Brother Ding. Brother Ding. Help me. -Brother Ding. -Help me! Help me. Jie. Go away.
