Presented by Executive producers A production of 'We are always chasing... ... money, status, love, property & wealth. By all means necessary. To gain sooner or later. But in this pursuit... ...beware of being trapped. You need to have a plan. You need to have a strategy. If you are trapped, you are done for. And you might do something unusual. "Unusual" in different definitions. Where you start to question whether... ...you had won, in disgrace. [ Robbery ] Or you had lost, in glory.' Mr. Murshid, I'm sorry. I had so much work today. Here are your documents. Thank you. Congratulations on your new baby. Alright, one more thing. The Bitcoins. It's settled. I've transferred them. You have? Yes. I haven't even given the details. It seems like you are really eager to drive your new car. I've made purchases before. So, I have the details saved. Tell your boss to accept Dogecoins in the future for business. I'll let him know. Next week, new cars are arriving. I'll keep you updated. Good. - Thank you. - You're welcome, Datin. Hi, I have a delivery for Mr. Ashraf. He's right over there. Thank you. Mr. Ashraf? That's me. This is for you. - Thank you. - You're most welcome. My electric scooter has arrived. It's wrapped carefully. Why is it this small? Where do you even put the batteries? Give this to your kid. Were you scammed? You'll only give me scammed items. Just take it. Not bad. Husna. Did the cosmetologist who's buying the Ferrari call? Cosmetologist? Which one? The one from Kelantan. - Oh. - The notable one that wants a Ferrari. I tried calling but no answer. When you are free, send this to Puspakom for inspection. Will do. Hello, Boss. 'Hello, Ashraf.' Yes, Boss. 'Why are you calling me Boss?' 'You should call me sweetheart.' Sweetheart. 'Don't you love me anymore?' I'm at the office. Ofcourse I love you. I'm not just the No. 1 manager here but also No.1 in your heart. 'No need for that. I've called you many times.' 'What were you doing?' I was attending to the customers. What else would I be doing? Where are you? Out of office? 'I just finished a meeting.' 'There's a new customer named Mr. GI' 'He keeps bothering me about buying a new car.' 'God knows where he got my number.' 'Handle it for me?' Mr. GI? Did he say which car he wants? 'He didn't say but he's at the showroom.' 'By the way, don't forget our lunch date.' 'There's a lot of things I need to discuss about our wedding.' Ok, I'll have it set. It's a date. Let me attend to Mr. GI. Bye, sweetheart. I love you. 'I love you too. Bye.' I told you. It's gone down. Many speculated. The profits now at 300%. I'll share with you the new investment options. Alright. Bye. Sorry, may I help you? Sorry, I'm looking for Sofea. You know, the boss. I made an appointment with her. And you are? Sorry, I'm Ashraf. I'm the No. 1 manager here. Sofea called me and asked me to handle you. So, how may I help you? Handle? Ok, Ashraf look. I'm actually looking for a car that will show off my status. But I'm confused. Whether I should get this wagon or that Double R. Ok Mr. GI, between the two, if we look at this Ferrari. If we look at its' horsepower, the color, the body shape, the aerodynamics. It gives off "player". - Oh. - So, it attracts the ladies. Now, if we look at the Rolls Royce Ghost Its more affluent and elegant. So, it gives off "Most Eligible Bachelor in town." Actually, both would suit me but it's complicated. Oh, let me take this call. Yes, Dato'. Yes, I'm at the showroom browsing new cars. > 8 Million? > That's nice. > That's perfect. Take care Dato'. Ashraf. Yes, Mr. GI. My friend, a Dato', recommends that I get the Bentley Conti GT in yellow. The perfect car for the perfect person like you Mr. GI. But I'm really sorry. The car in that color will need 3 weeks. 3 weeks? That's a long time. A waste of time. Oh well, it's not like I have a choice. Sorry, Mr. GI. I don't mean to pry, but... I was just wondering and it got me interested. If there are investment opportunities for me. Because I'm actually getting married. Obviously, it costs a lot of money to get married. So if there is any investment that can put a smile on my face then... - You're interested in investments? - Yeah. - That's nice. That's good. This won't only make your mother-in-law and your future wife happy, you too. I don't usually do this. Big things are coming. Overseas hotel lease schemes. 300% profit with zero risk. 300%. I'm interested. Sure, that's good. If you're really interested, here's my card. Ashraf, when you're ready to change your future, call me. - And don't forget, Bentley Conti GT. - In yellow. - I'll call you. - Alright. Wow! 300%! 'Are you ok?' What's going on? I - You seem distant. You're not yourself right now. Ashraf, if you're not in the mood to have lunch, just tell me. Please don't make me mad. No, it's not that... Actually, it's... Excuse me, waiter. It's... If I didn't want to, I wouldn't have... 300 ?! What? I forgot to bring my wallet, sweetheart. You forgot your wallet? Cliché. It's 300, sweetheart. Give me your phone. My phone? Why? Who do you need to text? Settled. There's QRPay. One more thing, don't forget in two days we're meeting my parents for dinner. Be smart and be on time. Bye. WHISPERS : 300. 50,000. 80,000. Times 300.

You can imagine the kind of car I own. - Ashraf, Take a look at this. "The overseas hotel lease schemes includes luxury hotels." I'm in 12 lots from France to Dubai. - Two weeks ago, it was at RM120,000. Now it's RM720,000. You want to be a champion? Zero risk. RM 720,000? In two weeks? Mr. GI, my target is that 300% profit. Please help me. I want to be a champion like you. But 300% in a week? - Yes. - Profit every week? Ashraf, don't waste time. You're not focused. Unbelievable what I am offering you today. All payments due today. Are you ready? Don't waste time! Where do I make payment? Yes! Don't waste anyone's time! But before my team and I accept any payments. I would like to choose someone amongst you, to be a protégé. Even at first glance, I know... I can sense it. A millionaire is amongst us. - Ashraf. It's you. He's talking about you. You are the chosen one! Me? But why me? He's coming. There's a lot of other people. Are you ready to change your life? Yes. Yes. My name is Ashraf. Ashraf! Give Ashraf a millionaire's applause ! TOGETHER : Ashraf! Ashraf! This is my card. Ashraf, don't waste more time! Now, Ashraf. Even at first glance, I know. You are the chosen one! Who is the chosen one? I am! I am! You are the chosen one! This is it. A champion ! The world is for you, Ashraf! Ashraf! Ashraf! Ashraf! What's happening? Why is it going dark? Come on! Come on! Master Doni. Why is it dark? Hello. Hey! Why is it going to voicemail? This can't be. Mr. GI. Are they in on this? I'm a dead man. Was I scammed? Open the door! Don't make me bust the doors down! Excuse me. Do you work here? No, I'm the chosen one. We thought you worked here. Master Doni! Master Doni! Please open the door! The application on my phone is down! Master! Please don't do this to me! I have no money! I'm going to get married! Oh no! I've been lied to again! Why did they do this to me? I keep being lied to! I hate this! Brother, are you ok? I'm not ok. It's all gone! My heart can't take it. You're that celebrity, right? Can I take a selfie with you? Not now. Hey! We've been out here for ages! Why haven't you been answering? I don't know anything. This place has been empty for a long time. Please! Please don't do this to us! I don't know anything, sir. The tenants change every month. One month it's a realtor, another month it's a gold dealer. And another it's a phone's accessories store. 'I don't know anything, sir. I'm sorry.' What do I tell Sofea? I'm done for. Brother! Have you called the Tan Sri to deliver the S400? Oi! Do you hear me? Either he's in a conflict with the boss... ...or he's been scammed again. What do I do? [TEXT] Where are you? Why didn't you answer my calls? Call me back ASAP. Brother. If Sofea calls, tell her I'm out with a customer. Tell her yourself. You're not the boss of me. I'm just asking for a favour! Why won't you help me? Suit yourself! What a fuss. So full of himself. Just because you're marrying the CEO's daughter. Stupid! Stupid Scam! You're the cause for all this! You! Why lie to me? Why? Brother! Don't jump! We can fix this! Please! Don't jump. Relax. Take a deep breath. Think this through. Come down, please. Relax. Let's talk. Please. Who are you? Where'd you come from? I'm from the building next door. I saw you and I thought you were going to jump. So I rushed here. And this is not the first time I've tried to convince someone to not jump. Please, don't. Did the person jump? Almost. But I told them I'd buy them dinner. So, they didnt. You can't buy me dinner because I'm getting married. It'd be wrong if you do. Any other ideas? What if I get you... ... a bitcoin? Bitcoin. Ok? No. Wait, let me think. Wait! Ok, if your wedding's cancelled, let's go on a date. Thank you. I wasn't really going to... ... jump. And I didn't come down because... ... you convinced me. I'm just tired... ... of being lied to. I can't do it anymore. There is no problem that can't be solved. Right? What's important is... ...how we get through it. Right? Either face the problem, or runaway. What a speech. Are you human? What else would I be? Ofcourse I'm human! And maybe... ...I was meant to help you. "Problems become ideas. Ideas become solutions." "Yes, you. Who found this card." [TEXT] Don't forget dinner tonight. Dad cooked something special for you. Daddy. Sorry. I had a lot of work to get done. Kevin, Tan Sri Lim's son, is now our regular customer, right? I'm sure, Ashraf was the one who closed the deal. This is crazy. I'm so anxious. I knew he could do it. Like I always say... "Always look at people's attitude," "Skills can be learned." "But attitude..." "...cannot." I can see that positive attitude in Ashraf. Yes, daddy. Everything positive is Ashraf. And everything negative is me. Don't sulk. Don't be mad. I wanted to ask you. Did Ashraf show you the Bridal Gallery I recommended? Yes, he did auntie. Phia, mommy. Yes, he did mommy. He has also chosen the color. And we went to see the hall. Maybe today. Problems. Becomes ideas. I do have a lot of problems. Those can be ideas. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, sweetheart. Seriously? What is this? I'm terrified. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. Are you the one who told us to be here? No. This is the Inspiration Warehouse, right? What is this place? Wait. You're that famous rapper on TV, aren't you? Danny D, uncle. I knew it. I think I've seen all of you. At the scam office the other day. Yes, where else? Same place I got scammed. So, who invited you (uncle, brother and sister) here? Did you just refer to me as a "sister"(young) ? Sorry. Look. I found this card on my windshield. Same. Me too. So the question is, who is behind this? It was me. It's you, the rooftop lady. Why aren't you answering your phone? Maybe he's cheating on me. What do I do? Hariz! I'll call Hariz. I trusted Mr. GI. Also, we matched on a dating app. I saved up money for 30 years. I planned to buy a big house. I promised my family that we were going to move into that new house but... He said it many times. 300%. 300%. 300%. Everyone on his team had luxurious cars. Everything looked real and legitimate. And I did get the profit during the first two weeks. He told me the price of gold is rising. Everywhere. So, I got excited. I gave him all of my money. Then... ...he dissappeared. My mom's money, my sister's money. All gone! There was even a presentation. The hall was packed. I believed it. It felt like I was in a trance. The fake housing project even had land grants. At the moment, I was so foolish. I couldn't see through it. I even went to visit the fake housing project site. On week 3... ...this is when all the excuses started. The money I was suppose to receive were late. Then, silence. Just like that - silence. The money I saved from 2 years worth of shows... ...gone. I have payments that are due. If I have no other option... ...I'll have to get the money from illegal loan sharks. I lost. RM 80,000. And a broken heart. I was scammed RM 300,000 from Atira. Who would've thought a pregnant woman could be a con! RM 400,000. RM 400,000 gone. I'm ashamed. Because I asked my friends to join as well. RM 80,000 in a blink of an eye. I thought I was better than this. So, we've all shared our stories. Rooftop lady, what's your story? Not rooftop lady. I'm Nadia. I was a scammer. What? Seriously? I no longer live that life and I left the biggest scammer. His name is Farouk. My father was a mentor. Farouk's mentor. And now... Farouk has entrapped my father. Now, he's in jail. Ok. I'm determined to save my father and set him free. From jail. And I want to atone for my past mistakes. So, I want to help Farouk's victims. That's all of you. So, our purpose for meeting tonight is... ...to reveal the true Farouk. Ok? Scammers are very cunning. They manipulate situations to gain your trust. And take advantage of your weaknesses. For example, Sarah. Desperate for love. So when a man that checks your list appears... ... you fall. Ashraf, Daniel. I'm sure... ...that Farouk's team said the right words. Dropped names. "Huge profits." Am I right? I'm also sure... ...they kept chanting your names. When we first meet people, when they remember our name. That makes us trust them. These are their standard tactics. And last but not least, Pak Kassim. Easy target. Old. Gullible. And likes things easy and cheap. Those weaknesses are their capital. So many village folks were conned by this fake housing scheme. Wait. So, now... ...what does all of this has to do with us? Yeah. Farouk is Atira's boss. And Mr. GI. - Oh. - And Farouk is also... ...Doni. Understood? I know how Farouk and his team operate. And I can help you get back your money. Why are all "Farouks" - villains? I'll be home in a minute. To find sustenance. For me to bring home. (Home) For my family, I can afford it Let me not eat The promise feels easy though Much less 'Peace be upon you, Mom' I feel calm (yeah) 'Yes, I understand' I'll be home soon (home) To find sustenance For me to bring home (home) For my family, I can afford it Let me not eat The promise feels easy though Much less I feel calm (yeah) Five years ago 'What's up bro?' We had intentions to create a song Along the winding road 'Yes, I understand' Until times change 'Bro, I'm looking into it' It's never easy As long as you push through 'Have patience.' I go where I want 'I'm ok.' I'll be home in a minute To find sustenance For me to bring home (home) For my dear family 'Yes, I understand.' Let me not eat 'I'm ashamed, bro.' The promise feels easy though Much less I feel calm (yeah) I'll be home soon (home) To find sustenance. For me to bring home (home) For my family Let me not eat. 'Peace be upon you, Mom' The promise feels easy though Much less. I feel calm (yeah) - Dad. One by one (yeah) - Where have you been? Go when it's time (yeah yeah) I just realized - You think this is a hotel? It's all about family - Don't you care about what's happening? Give me a little time - Don't you care about what happens to me? I do it for my family Don't get me wrong (yeah) Don't assume I'll be home soon (home) To find sustenance. For me to bring home (home) For my dear family Nadia! Thank you for helping us. No problem. This week, Farouk and his team are looking for their new victims. So, we have to be 5 steps ahead. Listen to my plan. This is the storyboard. For visualization. Modern problems require modern solutions. This is us. We are looking for the mastermind. That doesn't even look like me! I'm prettier than that. Ok, so this is Farouk. Supposedly, potential victims are in this building. Suddenly, a van arrives. The van is on its' way to the building. Understood? Wait. Are those two people infront of the building, architects? Well, if you let me finish. It will all makes sense when I'm done. Bro. What's inside the van? Farouk's money is inside the van, bro. If all of you let me finish. Then, you can ask questions. Is that ok? So, this is the best part. This is you. You are the millionaire in this plan. You'll be loaded with cash. And you'll have a driver. Who will be the driver? Me. Just a moment. I have a question. Why is he the millionaire and not me? He's too young! Because you don't have the millionaire vibe. He's different! He has the style of a millionaire. Just let me finish. Questions later. What about me? I better have a good part. I'm excited. I need your help on something. Of course! What do you need? Will you stop referring to yourself as "I alls" and us as "you alls"? My ears are bleeding! Agreed! What a fuss. Sarah, this part is yours. Pak Kassim and Nadia. Tie up this security guard. Then go undercover and drive the van to the building. Which K-drama plot did you get this idea from? Either way, I can't drive at night. I have bad eye sight. We got get into an accident. Pak Kassim, if it was at night, I would've drawn lights. There would be the moon and the van's lights would be on. But the plan is to be done during the day. Not at night. This is the best part. When you arrive at the building, you have to fight. Fight off Farouks' men. And make sure you win. Take the money and leave. Is that a cat? I have a cat that looks just like that! His name is Mr. Rocco. Do you want him there? Hello, bro. Why is there a cat in the storyboard? A mistake? Ok, listen. I'll pay 30%. I'll pay the rest later since the drawings are incomplete. Bye. How dare you negotiate. Highly imaginative Ashraf. I must admit, but... ...it won't be that easy. We have plan around Farouk. Look at his routine, his usual spots and understand his plan. What we need is a stake out. Thank you. I'm the king of the world! So, this is the place. Very fancy. Yes, this is one of their safe house. 'Yes.' 'Just like last time.' 'As usual.' 'See you soon.' 'Don't be late. Time is money.' He coming at us. What do we do? Is he for real? Why? He's picking at his tooth. Don't move. Don't move. God, he's picking at his other tooth! Is he gone? He can't see us. Are you sure? What? He's doing this. Is he gone? Daniel, stand by. Daniel, go in now and play it cool. You can do it. Daniel, what's your status? Give me a moment. Please sit. A pregnant woman just sat down with Farouk. Who is it? 'Hello! Guys, what's the update?' What's wrong with you? We're on a stake out. 'I just want to know what's happening.' 'Is he there?' This is not the time. 'Fine.' 'I'll be sulking if you need me. Bye.' Isn't he suppose to be in a different fancy car that Pak Kassim told us about? Atira! Pak Kassim, stand by and follow Farouk. Pak Kassim! Pak Kassim, let's go! Drive! Ok. - Quickly! -I am being quick. Follow them. Turn left. Now a U-turn. I know. Hit the pedal. I'm doing my best. Hello. Farouk just entered a laundromat. How did it went? "Ayo guys, what's up? It's your boy Danny D." "I'm here with a friend." "Professional, running with my clique. International." It's from a rap. Oh, rap. Do you have it? Can you make money from this? Yes, you can! Especially if you can talk and make content. Alright, he's leaving. Pak Kassim, that's him. Nadia, Ashraf. Farouk has just left the laundromat. He's carring a briefcase. What do you want us to do now? Please don't scream! Ok, we'll tail them. Pak Kassim, Ashraf is here. Finally here. It's getting late. You can leave. Ok, we'll get going. Anything let us know. I was only starting to feel like a spy. No need to be a spy. I need to get home quickly to a toilet or else I'll ruin the upholstery. What are they doing there? Are they now loan sharks? Spilling paint on someone's house for not paying? No. They're up to something. I have a strong feeling that this house will be their next headquarters. Did you get it done? This time I want it to be huge. All done, Farouk. Just like you asked. I've reserved 2 slots for your appearance. I've been wondering to ask you... ...how much longer do we have to do this? As long as it takes. I have the King. Now, the pawn must die. It baffles me. How can they be so relaxed? Staying at fancy hotels. Having expensive meals. Doesn't anyone find them suspicious? "Invisible hands." They are well protected. Even if they get caught, they'll be released. Nothing will come back to them. Well protected? I just don't get it. I can't believe they'll get away with it. People like Farouk has millions stashed for his escape. Even if they do get caught, maximum 2-3 years. Then they're out. Bu, have you seen the boss? She's on leave for a week. Off for a week? I want to look beautiful. The most beautiful. You can afford it. Who's calling me? Take the call. Tell him. - Answer it? - Answer it. 'Hello, sweetheart. It's me.' 'Honey, I want to apologize.' 'For being absent these last 3-4 days.' 'Hello?' Hello. 'Just hello?' 'Why don't you call me sweetheart?' 'Don't you love me anymore?' What do you want? I'm out with a friend. Just call me later. 'Sweetheart.' 'I'm at the office.' 'I was looking for you then I asked Abu.' 'Abu said you're on leave for a week.' 'When can we meet?' You want to meet up? You can only see me, when I want to see you. 'When is that?' I actually called you... ...to ask you. After that, you can do as you like. I just want to know where you went last night. Wait, what is wrong with you? I have texted and called you many times and you don't answer. Now you want to know where I went? For your information, I was at home last night. Sweetheart. Please don't joke around. I know where you were last night. Please don't do anything that will break our engagement. I know I've made many mistakes. Sweetheart! Phia, why are you always being played by men? They can do no wrong. If we're too nice, they'll walk all over us. So, what do I do? Up to you but if it was up to me, this is all over. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. Why the urgency? I'm too old to be rushing about. Don't shoot the messenger. Nadia asked us to be here. Where is she? Hi, sorry I'm late. Ok. I have updates on Farouk. Good news, bad news. Good news first. Bad news will make me faint. Have a seat. The good news is... ... what we gathered yesterday is valuable. Praise be to God. Farouk will act as suspected. But this time, it's on a grander scale. It will involve RM 4-5 Million. Banks, corporate people and millionaires. Forex is their next target. But... ...this is perfect timing for us. I will get back all of your money. What about the bad news? Yeah. The bad news is... ... we have 2 days. So, we have to be quick and be ready. But I have another good news. 2 days? That's not much time. We have to act regardless. That's our money. Nadia, what's the other good news? Do you remember Ashraf's storyboard? We will follow this plan from A-Z. This is not good news. This is bad. Nothing good about this. Are you serious? This is RM500 money well spent on the storyboard. All their plans are here. I know what's inside their head. And you... ... you're the millionaire in this plan. But Rocco the cat is there. - Do we need to bring him along? - No. The cat was a mistake. There's no need for the cat to be there. Sarah. You stopped using "you alls" and "I alls". What a fuss. Ashraf, we need to detail out the plan. It needs to be perfect. And the best part is... Farous is utilizing the security van to transport the scammed money. Just like Ashraf's plan. I will check the van's schedule. So, guys. Let's not waste time. Master Doni used to say that. Let's plan. Ok? - Ashraf. - Yes. Is everything ok? All ok. Done and this one's almost done. May I ask you something? But don't get mad. Ask me anything. I'm like the information counter at the mall. You're too much. Last night... ...was that your fiancé? Yeah, why? But she was out with another man. I don't know. For now, my focus is here. I just want my money back. That's all. For our plan to work... ...you need a clear mind. I'm telling you the truth. What do you mean? Settle your problems. Especially with your fiancé. Agreed! Do what you need to get done. - Let me take over. You go. - Alright. I'll go and you take over. Stop playing. Guys. Pak Kassim! Yes! Count the money. But when I call, you don't answer. Where are you off to so quickly? Harith, I imagine the wedding to be really grand. - Sofea. - But I... Move over. I said move over. Ok. Ashraf. Sofea. I just want one thing. Stop with the lies. I know where you were last night with him. Be quiet. It's ok. I'm not mad. - I... - Shh... Let's us talk. Be quiet. This is all my fault. This is my fault and you are the victim in this. I'm so sorry. May I take your order? Just a moment. - Give me a moment. - Alright. We just need a moment. Thank you. Sweetheart. I want to apologize too. I haven't been honest with you. About where I went and what I've been up to. You didn't do anything wrong. This is all my fault. I don't know how to fix this. I need to be honest with you. What did you do? All of my money, all of my savings... ... was scammed. Remember the man you asked me to handle? He scammed me. Mr. GI ! Mr. GI ? Yes, him! Why didn't you tell me? I could've helped you verify the investments. I just wanted to be rich in a short amount of time. But there is no shortcut to it. Now I have no money for our wedding. But if you stick around, I'll fix this. You should have told me this sooner. You made me overthink things. I thought you were cheating on me. It's ok. Let me help you, sweetheart. Sofea, I don't want your money. I need you to give me a chance to fix this. I'm really sorry. I understand. But please... No more secrets. So, babe... ...this is your fiancé? Yes. Hello. Sweetheart, this is the wedding planner. Harith. Hi. You heard that, right? Nothing expensive. No. You two make a sweet couple. Don't worry. My service is the best. Pak Kassim! What do you think? We have to make sure this plan works. There's no other way. Can you be here on time tomorrow or do you need a wake up call? I think I'll just stay here. I'll help Daniel. I'm so determined. - Ok. - That's right. I won't be able to sleep tonight. I can't wait for tomorrow. You ok, Nadia? I'm ok. I checked the van schedule and everything's on time. - Ashraf. - Guys! - Yes, Daniel. - What's up? What's up? I have a surprise for all of you. This is to make our roles look more legitimate. This is for Sarah. Oh no! Keep going! This is for Pak Kassim. A uniform! For you my brother. Where did you get all this? So... ...what we need to do now is be updated. Mr. Bing, update everyone. Gentlemen. Sorry I'm a bit late. It's ok. I don't smoke. Then why do you have a cigar? For style. I like this man. He's a true gentlemen. Like I said earlier... Where did you get the idea for the cigar? It wasn't in my storyboard. Alright guys, any time now. The van is approaching. Sir, roll down your window. What's happening here, miss? Sorry, we're getting the road fixed. It'll be around 10 minutes. - We're actually in a hurry. - Oh really? Sorry! Good morning gentlemen! Today marks an exciting day. For all of us. To be rich... ...we already are. But to be a billionaire, well... ...that's why we're here. Correct? I believe my partner here, Mr. GI... ...has shared with you all information on TFX's system. A system that guarantees... ...whether your method is bearish or bullish... ...that you will make a profit. Either way. I know, to fork out one milllion... ...might be troublesome. But what if I told you gentlemen, that in one month's time... ...you could bring home 40 million! Within our grasps. Sorry. Now, we get our news from our insiders in New York, London... ...Beijing, Sydney and throughout the rest of the world. And whether you buy it yourself... ... this system guarantees... ...profit for all. This TFX system guarantees all of us... ...heaven on earth. Any questions? I'm really sorry. We're borrowing the van for 5 hours. Good luck Pak Kassim! Good luck ! We can do this! Dato' Naz, thank you very much. Here's your device. - Thank you. -Congratulations. Dato' Amir, my old friend. Here's your device. Congratulations. You'll have access to your device in 20 minutes. If there's any problem, contact me. Ok. Be safe. Stop! Gentlemen. Just a moment. Before we hand you our money... ...I have a request. Show me the live rate tracker now. What are you doing? This was not in our plan. Relax. Just trust me. I knew this might come up. No problem. Gentlemen, please take out your phones. Now as you can see... ...these are the live trades that are happening right now. And this is my account. Utilizing TFX's system. Absolutely my poison - making money! Now we're convinced. Thank you sir. Gentlemen, it is time to breathe money. But before that... I've prepared a little feast for us. So, come. Join me. This way. This way. Well, this is different. The van looks like an ice cream truck. The usual van was caught in a flood so we had to use this one. If everything's loaded, we'll get going. Ok, drive safe. That's precious cargo. If anything, contact us. Will do. Thank you. What are you doing? We didn't rehearse this. Don't fool around. I was just being in character. We got it! Do you know them? Of course I do. That's Bibin's brother. He drives the van around town. - Oh, Bibin's brother. - Oy ! Fools. Are you blind? That's not our people! Get them now! Let's go to the feast. How can you think of food at a time like this? What? Ashraf, the door! Get it yourself! - We're suppose to be in character. - That was then. I think we're in the clear. We weren't tailed. - Praise be to God. - Praise be to God. That was quick. I need to take a leak. Can you take the bags to the car? - Yes, sure. - I'll go take a leak. But where? What about that building? Oh yeah. Just a moment. Nadia! Nadia! - We made it ! - We did it. Success! This is heavy. I didn't know money is this heavy. Just a moment. Hello. Hello. Patience is a virtue. Who is this? 'Can't you tell from my voice?' 'No wonder you're easily fooled.' Oh! You prick. Farouk? Now you're being clever. Makes my work easy. When your brain works. Farouk, scamming us was a mistake. We're smarter today. Now you're being cocky. I'll live with it. Ok. Put me on loudspeaker so all of you can hear me. Ok. Listen to me. Listen. I'll let you win. Because I want you to feel like you're winning. But, in reality... ...I have planned for your demise from the beginning. Fools. You're calling me a fool? Farouk. We have a plan for you. You fell right into our trap. 'Oh.' Your juvenile plan to rob me? That was your plan? Bravo. Who do you think you are? I am Farouk. If you ever think that you are one step ahead... Well... I am 10 steps ahead of you. Understood? All of your money are with us now. Don't you be cocky. My bags of money are with you? Ok. Why don't you open up those bags. Please. Be my guest, Ashraf. Bro. - Bro. - These are all junk! Farouk, you prick! Oh no. And the interesting part is... ...you weren't just fooled. You also did the robbery for me. 'The van that was on its way to the bank.' Ok, I'm getting bored. Better luck next time and in the future... ... do some background check. On who you trust. I'll leave the rest to the police to find you. Pak Kassim! Pak Kassim! Pak Kassim! What do we do? You got what you wanted. Now fulfill your end of the deal. Relax, Nadia. Don't be too serious. You'll add wrinkles to your face. I'm a man of my word. A deal is a deal. But are you sure? You want the thing that will set your father free? Why don't you keep working for me? I don't have time for this. To play your stupid games. Ok. G, make the call. Give her what she wants. A little more, up ahead. Don't kill me. I didn't do this just to con people. I did it for my father, G. You know Farouk framed my father. Now my father's in prison. You know this. The ledger in his hands will save my father. Please, G! Good job, G. Peace be upon you. Good morning. I'm Doctor Adha. I've spoken to the specialist. The best is, this procedure be expedited. We'll place a stent. The sooner, the better. The nurse will brief you in a moment. I'll go for now. Thank you doctor. Pak Kassim. Everything that happened... ...was fate. Don't think about that. You need to rest. Daniel? Sarah? Are they ok? I tried calling them. But no answer. Maybe they're still mad. Actually, I... ...am happy. Even if we have to... ...face all these trials. I am grateful... ...I made new friends. Youthful ones. Pak Kassim. Me too. I'm happy I met you. Dad? May I say something? I just received some information. There's a group offering new options in Crypto. But there's something off. They're incorporating second layer blockchains with... ...a mirror server. So I intercepted their IP address and located them in KL. I was able to identify the company and the owner's name. You understood all that? I only understood the group part. You lost me at everything else. I thought you understood. Kal. Please tell us... ...what you found out. Brother. The company belongs to Farouk. Why didn't you tell me sooner? What exactly do you do? I just did a little digging. And I did some research on Farouk's plan. Sarah. Why are you here? Sarah, we need to talk to you. Sarah, please. What are you doing here? Sarah, we need you. We have a plan. If your plan involves me getting scammed again, I want no part of it. I have no interest. Sarah, please trust me. Give me a moment with her. Sarah. We need you. Just hear him out. My scam kings and queens... ...I salute you. Each and every one of you. Atira. Please share with us, our latest earnings. Well, boss. It's RM 10.5 million ! Did you hear that? Remind me of our slogan. For as long as our hearts beat, we won't stop! You are the best! Alright, listen up! You've heard of "FOMO" and "Bulling." Yes. Yes, boss. For our next project... ...we need new victims. Newbies in crypto. Mr. GI, tell them about your brilliant plan. So... The new plan is... We will create a new coin. It will be named "Shabby Uno Coin" Sounds good, right? The best part is, it will be offered at a very low price. Starting at 0.15. Within a 20 million market cap. Then, what's next. Bam! A "Rug Pull". Let me tell you. This will be the biggest scam of the century. I'm confident we will score big. We're not talking about 5-10 million. But 15 freakin' million in a week! How about that? Which means... ...Raya came early this year! Alright? Mr. GI will brief you on the details. This plan will have no holes. Mr. GI, go ahead. Everyone. Focus. What we need to do is... ... find 100 people first. And the rest? Will be from word-of-mouth. And Mike! Yes? Set up a mirror server. G, is that it? See me in my office when you're done. So my question for you is... Are you in or out? Yes or no? TOGETHER : Yes! Well. Where are we celebrating tonight? Mr. GI, Mr. GI. You really are 10 steps ahead. You are definitely turning into me. Wasn't expected but I like it. But... No one can be Farouk. You get it, don't you? I do. Farouk. I just need one more thing. To perfect our scam. What is it? I need you to... Flash you crypto value. What for? To trick victims into thinking you have the highest valued coins. When in fact, you don't. It's all a ruse. Is it really necessary? Yes. We're talking about 20 million, Farouk. Split, down the middle. Then we'll leave those foolish employees out there. And start fresh with a new team. You have really changed. More cunning. I like you even more. Ok. I'm in. Just a ruse. For 20 million, why not? I got a tip. That within the next 2-3 days... Farouk is about to strike again. Bro. Can I ask you something? Aren't you tired of all this? When will you realize that we can't stop Farouk? I know that you may have a plan. But, Ashraf... It might come back to bite us. Yeah. I won't deny, it might happen. But... If we are faced with a problem... We have to find 100 solutions. Within the process of finding for a solution... We'll have perfected our methods. What's up guys? No time to waste. This is Pak Kassim's son. Haikal. He will fill us in on the plan. But he's just a child! Alright, so Farouk has started his new plan. But this time, it's with Crypto Coin offerings. I need access to Farouk's Crypto ledger. A lot of his illegal earnings are in Crypto. From there, I can maneuver and covert them to USDC. Then return all money to their rightful owners, yours included. Most importantly, to clear your from the bank robbery set up. What's a Crypto ledger? I don't know much about Crypto. Let alone a ledger. It's similar to a USB. But state of the art security for Crypto. Like a wallet's hardware. Do you understand? It's also like a pendrive. So, I need you to... ...to get that pendrive for a moment so we can transfer the data to a laptop. The perfect time to do this is at a coin launching event happening soon. Are you two in? The question is... Can the four of us do it? 'Actually I'm the owner...' I've been hearing a lot about Shabby Coin. Do you have any news about it? What I've heard is, by mid-year, Shabby Coin is about to blow up. - Confirmed? - Yeah, ofcourse. Cheers! 'How's everybody doing?' 'How are you, ladies and gentlemen?' TOGETHER : Good! - 'Again, how are you, ladies and gentlemen?' - Good. - 'I can't hear you. How are we? ' - Good ! 'Before I entered the hall...' 'I was told by my assistants about...' 'Some good news and some unsavoury news." 'Let me share with you the good news first.' 'I am looking at and in the presence of...' 'Pioneers of a new digital wealth.' 'Shabby Uno Coin!' 'Yes!' 'Now for some unsavoury news.' 'I don't know about you but personally I don't like bad news.' 'But if we have to.' 'How many of you are here in this hall?' 'Where are the rest?' 'Well, the rest are suffering losses.' 'That's right.' 'Losses I can't even imagine.' Lies! Scammer! Give me back my money! Let me tell you, he is the one that has made me lost all my money! Liar! Give me back my money! Let me go! Don't believe him! It's because of you that I'm in debt with loan sharks! Come on, rapper. Don't cause a scene. Shame on you. Cause a scene? Mr. GI, he's the biggest liar! Please, it's better if you leave! Liar! Let me go! Because of these scammers, I've lost everything! Everybody. - Liar! - Ignore him. 'Get your hands off me!' - Sorry. - It's ok. Hey! 'Everybody calm down.' 'This is quite common. He was just being spiteful.' 'Let me be honest.' 'That was an investor that went under because of his own greed.' 'That's all' Boo! Relax, let's not shame anyone. Ladies and gentlemen, we might face similar situations. 'Then what's next, Mr.G ? 'Bam! Rug Pull.' 'This is going to be the biggest scam of the century.' What's this? What's this? Go, now! We need to go, now. 'Hello, I need a private jet. Now!' '40 minutes?' 'Ok, we'll be there soon.' - This is your last delivery. - Thanks. Take one of the bags. - It's ok. - You sure? I have what I want. - Come. - Let's go. What's going on, pilots? Jets like this don't get stuck. What is this, G? We're not going anywhere, Farouk. This is the end of the road. Well played. You got me this time. I see you've leveled up. Hi, guys. Nadia! Come. 438-08-341 - Yes! - Thank you. You. I thought you were... When in fact... Ok. If you let me go... We can go out for dinner? You're the biggest winner. Mr. GI. Trying hard to be me. You know what? There will only be one Farouk. 'More than 70,000 fraudulent cases.' Scam. Involving more than... RM 24 billion. From 2017 - 2022. One Malaysian is getting scammed, every 30 minutes. "Unusual" in different definitions. Where you start to question whether... You had won, in disgrace. Or you had lost, in glory. The answer is, glory triumphs. All of the money were returned. Now, rise. Hello. When? How's that? Thank for the info. Alright, bye. Guys.
