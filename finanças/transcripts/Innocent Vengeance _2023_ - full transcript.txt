Well, that's smart. Wait for it to dry first. Yes, let it dry first. Don't stick it right away. Now let’s install this one. Yes, but if you aren’t careful, the glue will sometimes come off. -Put in one more fence. -Yes. Isn't it backwards? No. -Happy birthday! -Happy birthday Dad! Oh my gosh, thank you. Come on, make a wish. I’ll make a wish. You’re waiting, aren’t you? You’re waiting, aren’t you? Thank you. This is it? Just a cake? No gifts whatsoever? There’s no gift. Happy birthday, dear. How about this? It’s from me. Aren’t you surprised? Surprise! You don’t have to buy me presents. Hurry up, just open it! -Wow! -Do you like it? This is really nice. Of course, I chose it. Let’s try it. -Wow, this must be expensive. -Of course it does! Gosh, it’s so beautiful. Beautiful, right? -Suits you well. -It’s so cool right? -Thank you, dear. -Happy birthday. Thank you. -More surprises? -Get over yourself! Just open the door. It must be Nara’s milkshake delivery. Is it you or Nara who actually orders? Yes, sir. Is this Kamboja Street? Yes, that's right Why? Is Prio here? -Who? -Prio Oh, there's no Prio here. Is Nanda here? There is no Nanda here. Try to look somewhere else. Hey! What are you trying to do? Please don't harm her. Nara! Let me go! Help! -Shut up! -Help! -Shut up! -Help! -Shut up! -Help! Help! Help! Help! -Shut up! -Help! Help! Shut up!!! INNOCENT VENGEANCE TWO YEARS LATER I've done it, but Dad hasn't. Yes, ladies and gents, we will divide this development plan into three-stages, and the facade design will be presented by my partner, Adam. Adam! Adam! Ladies and gentlemen, maybe we can talk about this three-stage concept. Adam when are you going to snap out of this? -What do you mean? -Oh, who's presenting? Hey, I prepared for this presentation. -I didn’t sleep for days! -Is this two of us or just me? Don't talk like that! That's your job! -It's my mistake. -I don't want to blame you, but you can't go on like this. Yes, I'm not focused anymore. It's been two years! There are no changes! You're stuck! Okay, I'll try to be better. I’ll try! Adam! Take a break and don't go to the office yet. No way! I need to work! Adam, listen to me! I’m doing this for you! I need to work. Try to contact her. There are plenty of cards like this at home. This doctor, that doctor, psychiatrist. My sister lost her child three years ago. This person is the person who helped my sister. There's nothing wrong with trying. Make an appointment with her. Just make an appointment with her for a few sessions. Call me when you're ready to go back to work. Take it. I promise, your job will still be waiting for you. Okay? -Hello? -Hello. Is this Doctor Amanda? Yes, Who’s speaking? I'm Adam. I got your number from… Mr. Kian. Yes, I know. Are you okay? Yes, I’m good. No problem. Mr. Adam, when are you free to visit? Anytime. Well, you can come now. I’m free at the moment. Okay. Mr. Adam, please come in. Oh, already? Okay. -Hi, Amanda. -Adam. Please have a seat. Anything to drink? Oh, I’m fine. I brought my own drink, thank you. You should have been here last week, Mr. Adam. -Oh, just call me Adam. -Adam. Sorry, I must record each session so we can keep track of the progress. Please, if that's the procedure. I am sorry. I really don't feel the need to come here, Doc. -So why are you here now? -I don't know. Kian is really worried about you. He said your work performance is declining. Lost in your own thoughts, at home you only eat instant noodles. Ummm… That's just Kian. -How's that? -He just worries too much. How long have you been a doctor? Eight years. Quite a long time. Do you like being a doctor? -There are likes and dislikes -What's the dislike? I’m the one analyzing, not you. I don't need to be analyzed. So are we just sitting here? Okay, let me tell you this. There's only one reason why I came here. To get my job back. That's all. By meeting you, there is a chance for me to be able to get back to work again. That's all. But if you don’t actively share your stories, how can I help you? Well, I don't need any help. Kian told me about what happened to you. No! Help! All right. So you know already. So you don’t have to ask about it anymore. I need to hear it from you. What for? If you want to deal with your trauma, we have to remember that incident, so we can overcome this trauma. All I have been able to think of for the past two years… That's all I can remember. Help me! From the knock on my front door, I opened the door, I saw there were three people. I remember the faces exactly one by one. The bald guy. Then the big guy with the beard and a limp. And the one with a fish tattoo on his left hand. I remember everything! My wife, Lina, died right in front of me and I couldn't do anything. My son was smothered until he suffocated. Do you need more stories? It wasn’t your fault Then whose fault was it? Your fault? If you have a trauma, It's not your fault. But to deal with it and overcome the trauma is your responsibility. Wow! This… Mr. Franky? Yes, that's me. It's my third trip of the day. Not so many orders today. Is that so? I hope there will be more orders later on tonight. Amen. How long have you been a web taxi driver? I'm only a few months in. Just trying something out rather than being idle. Yes, it's better to be exhausted from working than tired from doing nothing. That's right. I was unemployed for a long time in Jakarta. It wasn’t good. What do you mean? Living in Jakarta is such a hassle if you don't have money. Especially if you already have a family. Just turn right. Don’t turn left, because it’s congested up ahead. We're going this way right? Have you ever been down this road? I don't think I've been here before. I don't know this area well. That's right. I think I have picked up passengers from this area before. I just forgot, the roads look the same. KAMBOJA STREET Mr. Franky. Still remember me? Hey, are you still alive? Yes, I’m alive. Yes, how good your life is now. Waking up at this hour. I couldn't sleep last night. Are you doing the therapy? Yes, I was there once. Trust me, it's worth it if you come to her. Are you okay? I'm fine. Really? Do you want me to send food? No need, I got plenty of food at home. Instant noodles are not food, Dam. HOW ARE YOU BRO? I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU FOR A WHILE. JUST DROP BY THE WORKSHOP. WE'LL HANG OUT & HAVE COFFEE. Dam… Adam! I'm doing monthly groceries tomorrow. Okay. Dam, trust me, Amanda can help you. Just go through it first. -Okay? -Okay. Does your shopping cart really reflect your eating habits? It's mostly instant noodles at home. But different flavors. How are you? There are good days, there are bad days. You were projecting a lot of anger in our last session. At you? No, at yourself. According to you I must be able to cope with trauma. Is that what you want? I don't know, you're the doctor. Surprise. Happy birthday. Wah. God is the greatest. Do you live in this area? No. No wonder. I come here almost every day, but this is the first time I've seen you. I want to get my car fixed in the workshop down the road. -The one on the roadside? -Yes. That's my workshop. What a coincidence. What's wrong? I just want to check the engine. Oh I see. I’ll see you later. The engine is knocking. How long has this car been unused? One year. Can you help me get the green screwdriver over there? Thanks. I found the problem. The air intake is broken. You can wait. An hour at most. How about it? -Yes, sure. -Okay. You can wait in my room, It’s cooler. How long have you been working here? It's been six months. Just a personal, small business. What did you do before? I did odd jobs before I did everything to make a living. But I’m grateful, I can live off this business. It's great for you to have a workshop as big as this. Thank God. All thanks to hard work. Hard work? Have you been here before? Never. You look familiar to me. If your car is still acting up, just bring it back here. We have a lot of mechanics in the daytime. I usually work late too. Just stop by. The mechanics here are so good. The mechanics don't work night shifts. I'm the only one who works late. I usually lock up. So if there's a problem, just drop by. I will definitely be back. Who discovered the body? Those two boys. Has anyone found a cell phone or wall? No. Are you just going to sit there? I’m free to sit anywhere, right? The last time I saw you, my car was right behind yours in traffic. Can we talk about that? Do you think what you did was right? Yes I’m sure I was right that violence must be fought with violence. How long do you want to live like that? Until when? Until when? How do you feel now? Empty. Angry. Vengeful. Do you think revenge is the best solution? Maybe. Sometimes, the best revenge is when we are strong enough to forget. Yes, coming from someone who has never experienced what I've been through. I am a father, a husband, who lost his wife and children. And at the same time, I can't do anything about it. Trauma? It’s reasonable The next question, is it possible to get rid of the trauma? Yes, maybe. But for anyone, anyone who went through what I went through, there's no way to get rid of the vengeance. This is the only information we have at the moment. The corpse found in the car was named Franky Tamba. This figure has become the target of the authorities. Have you found out the culprit, sir? Up till now we still have no witnesses and don't know who the perpetrators are. Was this murder an act of robbery? I can't confirm anything. What about his family, has anyone contacted them yet? Let me tell you once again. At this time, I have not been able to confirm anything or contact anyone. This is an open investigation, so please give us some time to work on this case. Thank you. That's our coverage, Laras Ardhia reporting. This is the victim's file from yesterday. Judging from his record he's been in theft, robbery, drugs, and much more. How many cases are there this year? He’s clean this year. Most of his cases happened two or three years ago. -Is the car in his name? -Yes Check his name and the car whether is registered as an online taxi or not. If yes, check his last three passengers. Okay. How do you feel now? At times I feel like a failure Failed to protect my family. Anyone in a position like you would also be helpless. Because of that helplessness I lost everything, right? You've never told me about your family. There’s nothing I can say anymore. They’re gone. Maybe if you remember sweet moments with them, it might make you feel better. If I tell you again about the sweet moments, aren't we wasting our time talking about this? Try it first. If you start to feel uncomfortable, we can always stop this session. My wife's name was Lina. My son's name was Nara, he was eight years old. A super active kid. Couldn’t stop for a second. When you grow up, what do you want to be, son? Then he answered, I want to be like you, Dad. I want to be a builder, he said. He found 'architect' hard to say, so he said a builder instead. You have to study hard. Of course, Dad. I want to be like you, Dad. Today… Today is his birthday. I just remembered it's his tenth birthday today. Lina used to remind me because I keep forgetting his birthday. She remembered everything. Such a lovely person. I was very dependent on her ever since I lost them. I'm sorry. Ever since they were taken I don't know what to do with my life. So empty. Remember me? It happened several years ago. I’m really sorry. It wasn’t my idea. I just followed the others. And I had no intention of killing your family. Thank you, love. The gate was still open. The engine of this car was still running, so I turned it off. His identity? Gyat Santoso. He's the owner of the workshop. The employee said that he often worked at night. No one touch anything. I've done what you asked me to do. I've taken your advice. I also hope that you will give me a chance. I can go back to work. I really need this job and I promise I won't let you down. Please, Ki. I just need my job back. I'm tired of working alone. Your work is piled up in that room. Thank you, Ki. Thank you, Ki. You don't have to work until late at night to show that you're ready to work. Slow down If I don't work overtime, I don't work and you'll suspend me again. How are you coping? Just like this. Working for you. But your life is not just here. I just occupy myself, so when I get home I just go straight to bed. Okay. -I'm going home. -Okay. See you on Monday. Bye Ki. Hi, Excuse me. -Do we have an appointment? -No, no, no appointment. I just want to see you. I mean, I have something to talk about. I came here to apologize. I'd like to apologize if during those few sessions I was being difficult, a bit harsh too. I would like to apologize for that. And I want to meet and also to talk to you. I just don't want to be a person who's stuck and haunted by the past. Why the sudden change? Why can’t I? You can make changes for good reasons. My question is, why the sudden change? Maybe it's because I’ve done session after session, I didn't want it at the first time and I didn't need it. Until in the end I realized I needed help. It's not just you who have been through loss. Everyone has. I've been through loss as well. I lost my parents when I was 13 years old. Car accident. I was in that car while they died on the spot. I was raised by my brother ever afterwards. We hardly meet each other. He'll drop by if he needs money. Then I moved around, raised by different relatives. Don't look worried, I'm a tough girl. Doc, thank you for your time. Please make an appointment next time. Doc. Have you had dinner? My work makes me have no personal life. Are you deliberately using it as an excuse for not having time for yourself or what? Actually not really. I'm just always exhausted. Is it caused by patients like me? Not my words. No, I have nothing to say. Don't think I go out on dates with my patients, okay? No I never thought of you that way. We can go out now because you are not my patient anymore. Okay. Nara and I made that. I’m sorry, didn't mean it. It's okay. Do you want some bread? No thank you. Have you finished this? Nara should be the one to finish this. He must be so happy you finished it. Your house feels cold, but it feels warm as well. -How is it cold but feels warm? -I wonder too. I've never felt like this before. Just the little things. I told you that I used to move around a lot. Yes. So I'm pretty sure I've never felt this way before. Sometimes we need to be by ourselves. Before we can feel warmth with other people, right? Your life is so lonely. It's okay. As long as I don't get too lonely. Hey, what time is it now? I forgot I had a patient at nine. How can I forget? You don't have to be in a rush. Slow down. Just relax, no need to rush. I'm very late. The traffic won't be so heavy now. It's okay. Bye. Call me, okay? Bye. Bag. Bye. Good morning, Mr. Adam? -Yes. -May I come in? I have a few questions. Yes, please come in. What do you want to drink? Thanks, I just had my breakfast. This house is very nice. You must be an architect right? How did you know? I've always wanted to be an architect. Why didn’t you? It’s my math, it's my weakness. People are different, each one has their strengths and weaknesses. My strength is instinct. Can I help you, sir? Do you know Franky Tamba? Franky? No, I don't know him. Maybe if I show you his picture. Yes, but I don't think I know him. I haven’t showed you the picture yet. ARTICLE 364 OF THE CRIMINAL CODE, ROBBERY I don't know him. A few days ago, his body was found in a car at the side of a deserted road. What does this have to do with me? He works as an online driver and according to GPS this was his last destination. This address? Where were you on the 23rd of this month? I was home because I hadn't started to work yet. Did you use an online taxi service? I did. Just a drop off. -From? -From the sanatorium. I had a session with my therapist. -What time? -Evening, but I don't remember the time. Do you recall the driver's appearance? No, I don't remember what he looks like. Did you have a barbecue Mr. Adam? Actually, this is a dark case that we’ll have to close anyway. Because the victim is a fugitive along with his other partners. His partners? Gyat Santoso. I’m sorry, are you waiting for a reaction from me? Forgive me if I'm wrong. No. I'm just giving you a pause to answer. My answer is that I don't know. Okay, Mr. Adam, thank you for your time. Sure. I'll just leave my card here. If you have any other information please contact me. Yes, alright. Please, sir. I’m sorry I can’t help you much. No at all, you've been very co-operative. This is a nice car. It’s still in good condition, isn’t it? Looks can be deceptive. I've been having engine trouble. Can I see the inside? Yes, you may. As long as this car is taken to the right workshop, It’ll be fine. Alright Mr. Adam. Thank you for your time, I'll be in touch if we need more info. Good day. Hey, are you okay? I’m alright. I just have a lot on my mind. Do you want to be alone? No. I don't want to be alone I just want to be with you. I have to go home, I need to take care of something. Is everything okay? It's fine. Can I drive you home? No need, you want to be alone. I don't want to be alone, really. Well, if you feel better, you can come to my house tomorrow. I’ll cook for you. You should only cook healthy food for me. I only eat healthy food. I'm off. Don't daydream too much. Drive safely. -Hey. -Hello. I said I'd cook for you. Why did you buy groceries? Just in case you only prepare instant noodles. You have a lovely home. Very neat. A neat house is a reflection of the owner. Let me introduce you to someone. This is Adam, the one I told you about last night. My hands are dirty. My brother is visiting me. I'm Karni. Do you eat meat? Yes. Is it cooked yet? Why is it taking so long? Soon. Go and lay the table. I've made something special. My brother used to look like a skinhead, he's filthy, and looks like a thug. But when we were kids, we were inseparable. We were always with each other. Every time we were together, we were like a pair of balls stuck to one another. You're talking nonsense. But it's true right? You always tailing me wherever I go. I couldn’t even have a boyfriend. Guys avoided me. No, none of your boyfriends were decent. That's just your opinion. I’m just protecting you. You don’t have to be so strict. He always finds an excuse. You’re not a match for him. He is not good enough for you. Now you're snitching. Do you have any siblings? Let me ask you this. If we care about someone, wouldn't we do anything to protect them? Is that wrong? Nothing wrong with that, right? So don’t blame me, for taking care of you. -I'm full. -No way, you're too skinny. How can you be full? We've not met for a while, that's why he's like that. Usually he works out of town. Why do you have to lie? Just say that I just got out of prison. Why are you trying to cover it up? That's just the facts. What were you in for? Why were you arrested? -Robbery. -What did you rob? I didn’t do the robbery. I was accused of robbery. So never say I did the robbery. There is no proof. Can we talk about something else? Is the steak good? I'm always happy when my brother cooks for me. Why? I said I'm most happy when you cook for me. You're easy to please. Amanda, get a sharper knife for him. Get a sharper one. The meat is not too tender. Amanda said you were a widower. I am. How did your wife die? She was sick. What sort of illness? The illness… A very painful illness. You should learn to let go. If it really hurts you shouldn't suffer. Who is sick? We were talking about his wife. Oh my God, I forgot I had a meeting. Oh my God, I forgot something. I have an appointment with someone. I'm very late, they've been waiting for me. -Don’t you want to finish the lunch first? -No, I’m fine. Adam! Sorry, I was too caught up with my brother. It's okay. I need to be on my way. He had a hard life surrounded by criminals Since my parents died his life has not been as lucky as mine. It's okay I just wanted to ask about one of your patients. -Which patient? -Adam Gunawan, he's an architect. -You do know him, right? -Is there something wrong? Two murders were discovered two weeks ago. One of them was an online taxi driver and the other a workshop owner. What does that have to do with Adam? According to the information we have, Several years ago, Adam's wife and children were killed by three robbers. Those two victims were likely the perpetrators. Is it true that on the twenty-third of this month he had a session with you? -That's right -What time did you finish? It was around 9 p.m. Wait a minute, are you accusing one of my patients of being a murderer? No We just need to look at all the possibilities Because two of them have been killed If this case is related to the murder there is one more possible assassination target. So what does it have to do with me? We don't want to jump to conclusions. For now the connection between these two murders is your patient. You have come to a conclusion then. We need as much information as we can possibly get. So that we won't draw false conclusions We wouldn't want anyone innocent to be involved in something that would make them regret it for a lifetime. Now, what information can you give us? I don't have any information for you Even though I have it, I can't reveal it to anyone, as it violates the code of ethics Please find another source Thanks Doc The number you're calling can't be reached at the moment The number you're calling can't be reached at the moment My wife's name is Lina My son's name is Nara He was eight years old at the time. Ever since they were taken, I've not known what to do with my life So empty. How do you feel now? Empty, angry, vengeful, vengeful. Do you think revenge is the best solution? Maybe. At the knock on my front door, I opened the door. I saw there were three people. I remember the faces exactly, one by one. Started from the bald guy, The big guy with the beard and a limp And the one with a fish tattoo on his left hand I remember everything! My wife Lina, died right in front of me and I couldn't do anything My son was smothered until he suffocated Do you need more stories? Starting with the bald guy, my brother used to look like a skinhead, filthy and looks like a thug. Adam, Adam, finally you came. I've been waiting for you. Do you still remember me? Kamboja street When I first met you, I saw you. I knew you. And I recognized you. But I've changed now. I'm not the person I used to be. This is my life now. This is my life now. My son, my wife. I'm a crook. Not a murderer. What are you doing here? I'm here to see the person who killed my wife and son Is this the person you're looking for? What do you want to do? Do you want to shoot me? Think about your future. My sister's future. It’s better for you to go home now. If you feel your quest to find me is to settle your revenge… it's like digging two graves. One for me… and one for you. Is this what you want? Is this what you want? Father? Go. Get away from here. Get out. That's my wife and son. Please don’t hurt them. I beg you please, don’t hurt them. Kill me now, but don't do anything to them. Just go! That's my wife and son. Please don't hurt them. Adam! If you go through with this, you will be just like them.
