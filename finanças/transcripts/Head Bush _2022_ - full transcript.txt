Today is August 4th. Does anybody know the significance of this day? Madam, we got independence on August 15th. I think something started on this day. Madam? - Yes, Mr. Urs? August 4th, 1789. The day French Revolution began. Feudalism was demolished. You are absolutely right, Mr. Urs. - Thank you, Ma'am. That revolution fought for democracy. It fought for liberty, equality and fraternity. Since the time of the Mauryas, the Mughals and the British... We've been led by feudals and it persists till this day. We must break this feudalism. Madam is on a mission to transform the country. She's decided to break down the feudal system. But we must have the public help us support this idea. For that, we'll have to build a strong youth brigade. We must look to every state and district to help promote this idea. [CABINET BANGS THE TABLE IN AGREEMENT] What shall we name it Madam? Mr. Barua? People proclaim that 'India is Indira, Indira is India' Madam, he's right. It'll be called the Indira Brigade. Give me the opportunity to start it first in my state, Karnataka. Our Mr. Urs is a man of action. Please, go ahead. Thank you, Ma'am. Just like how revolutions took place in Russia and China, ...it should happen democratically in our country too. If none of you have any objections, I intend to name Nataraj as the State President of the Brigade. Excellent choice, sir. He's a dynamic person. If you are appointing MDN in this post... None of us have any objections. you are our chife Minister. You are Running this state. No matter what you decide, we'll abide by it. We'll take your leave. Nataraj... This is a great opportunity for you. Look for a man who'll be strong and sincere with you. With him, build an extremely energetic team. How much longer will this take, Murthy? Any minute now. Are all of these people here to see Jayaraj? Yes, Sir. In the surrounding localities and streets, there's no one who is a big name, like him. Since a young age, he's been extremely rebellious. It's going to be Head for sure. Ganga, no. It'll be Bush. - Wait! No! I bet on Bush. Dammit! Shall I flip it again? - Go ahead. Boys, how about sharing something with us? We paid up yesterday. Get going now. Flip the coin. Dammit! - Come on. Yesterday has gone by. It's time for today's share. Shut the f**k up and keep moving! I've other things to deal with. Sir, please don't beat us. How dare you punks! Sir, please don't beat him. He's a very good guy. He is into wrestling, so he's a bit temperamental. Step back, Ganga. What wrong did I do? Don't you guys play Head and Bush? Isn't that wrong? We play with our own money. What's wrong in that? It's an act of gambling. It's illegal. What do you call the act of cops approaching us for money while we're playing? What is up with him? Look at how he talks at this age. He's is a ruffian. Go out there and ask people what the Police stand for. We work day and night to protect vermin like you. People also tell us that the Police go out on roll-calls ...at liquor stores, gambling points and brothels. What's with the stare?! Will you fight with me? I'll break your legs! Come to the wrestling arena! Let's fight! We'll see who'll break whose legs! How dare you argue with the Police at this age? Let him go, sir. Jayaraj, let of the stick. Please listen to me. Don't do this, Jayaraj. - Sir, these kids are underage. Let them go, sir. - Get out! Let's go, Jayaraj. - Look at him staring at me! Punks, you'll only end up as gangsters. If we let him be, he'll turn into something unimaginable. We'll never be able to control him. Tell Soda Bottle Radhakrishna and Dagger Chandru that it's coming from me. Let them slash him in a couple of places. He'll learn to pipe down. Ay! Sir, please let us go. Who the heck is Jayaraj? Son of a gun! You're not even as big as my Willie! Heard you guys act all cocky! Let him know that if we get our hands on him, ...we'll freaking slash his fanny and make him unrecognisable. Start the vehicle! Soda Bottle Radhakrishna and Dagger Chandru were here. They flexed their muscles a lot! [INDISTINCT OVERLAP] They threatened to slash your fanny and make you unrecognisable. Dammit Samson!

[PEOPLE CHEERING IN UNISON] [PEOPLE CONTINUE CHEERING] This man walks on hot embers as if it's a cakewalk. Listen! - Tell me, Sir? Bring him home on Thursday. - Sure. [RETRO HINDI SONG PLAYS ON] Samson! Samson, I've burnt out after walking on the embers. I can't bear this Hindi song. Ask them to perform for a Kannada song. Chakravarthi! Oy! Come here! Tell me, Sir. Brother doesn't want this Hindi song. Let two Kannada songs play, you can then play a Hindi song. Got it? - Yes, sir. Urvashi, sing two Kannada songs for now. Sing the Hindi songs later. Sisterf****r! Who the hell changed the song?! Play the last song! Chakravarthi, come here! - Sir? Bast***d! Play a Hindi song! - Just do as told. Don't worry. Two more songs and we'll play a Hindi one. Kutti! Go check it out. Please listen to me. Why are you causing trouble? Brother has asked me to play a Hindi song after two Kannada songs. We want it right now! Who the hell are you mo********s?! Shut your mouth! Step back! Did you just try to headbutt me?! You think you can headbutt me?! Take this! Morons! You come to our city and you despise our language?! Please ask them to let us go! - You see the Big Brother over there? Go ahead and apologise to him! We will. Brother, we were wrong! Please forgive us and let us go! Wherever you go, you've got to respect the language of the land. Sure, brother. I know Hindi too. I like it. When you go to the other states, you respect Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam or even Marathi. When you're here?! Kannada first. Got it?! Get going! - Thank you, brother. Don't want a Kannada song, eh?! - Samson! Enough. Let them go. Son of a...! Gareebi Hatao?! Blockheads! Trying to remove yourself out of poverty or is it the public? Dic*head hasn't studied past fourth grade. Calls himself the Editor. Put your hands down. Stand straight! - Sir! My name is Samson. 'I am acting editor Gareebi Hatao' 'I know reading, writing' 'I study in convent sir. Full English' My my my! You're something else. How about this? Name ten littérateurs. What sir? - Name ten littérateurs. Will you tell me or not?! - Dr. Rajkumar. [NAMES YESTERYEAR CINEMA ACTORS] Acts like he's an offspring of the English! Say it out loud! - Let me answer. Pandaribai. - I'll kill you! Can't differentiate between artists and littérateurs. You think you can play around?! Where's that ba****d Jayaraj?! He's resting after the rituals yesterday. He doesn't need any rest before creating a ruckus in the club. But he needs rest to appear at the station?! Stand still! You guys don't mind getting sloshed and causing trouble, eh?! Punks! What's your name? Ganga. - What do you do? Sir, he's the son of Muniswamappa, the owner of the wholesale store on the cart street. Woah! Really? What about the other guy? He's Ganga's younger brother. What the heck?! Your brother's a dignified man. Why have you joined the Satan's army? These guys will screw your father's business. Jayaraj is a good man. Just that he's short-tempered. Sir, these guys are as ballsy as Jayaraj. Him and Samson are Jayaraj's childhood buddies. Tell that ba****d Jayaraj! He better be in the station before 9 P.M. Else, I'll parade his entire family out on the streets. Got it?! What's up, fuc**r?! Are you at a Police station or are you here for a wedding? Take off the damn shawl! What the f*** is this Jayaraj?! Jayaraj, listen to me! Don't do this! What the hell are you doing?! Don't do this! - Mo*********r! Get hold of him! - Stop! Hold him back! Stop right there, asshole! He's Jayaraj. If this man stands by us, Rao and Khan will not dare mess with us. Jayaraj! I saw you walk on embers. You look like a burning ember yourself. Good. Sit down. I found out about Gareebi Hatao. I saw you guys help the public in your own way. But you shouldn't have attacked the Police, Jayaraj. I didn't do it for the sake of it. He spoke filthy things. I couldn't bear that. Let that be. They won't mess with you again. Sir, the Inspector is here. Mr. Gowda? - Sir? He is Jayaraj. He's important to us. Don't mess with him again. Okay, Sir. - Shake hands. Do it. Jayaraj? Go on. I'll take your leave. Jayaraj, there's something you need to know. As per Indira Madam's instructions, Urs Sir wants to build the Indira Brigade. I am the Brigade's State President of Karnataka. You... are in-charge of Bangalore. For that, you have to build a mob with all the gangsters in Bengaluru. Take it under your control. By becoming their leader. Balepete, Thigalarpete and Ganigarapete. These localities are under our control. We haven't been everywhere though. What if they don't...? Bow down to me? You don't understand Governance, Jayaraj. When you're part of the Governance, every cop and government official will be on your side. You're not putting up a show for the heck of it. Do as you please. I'll stand by you. Let's not let Kerosene Seena anywhere near us. He's out there getting sloshed and causing brawls. Marks Tony is no damn gangster. Razor Vasu, Majestic Miyaan and who's the other guy? Kaaya Krishna. - Yes, him. These guys are loyal to us. They won't interfere. Everything else is set. Except for Dhobi Ghat Lakka. I am THE one. Kalasipalya's double whammy Ganapathi. What are you doing here? Sit down [IN TAMIL] These two guys and the Shivajinagara's Kasaai Gang's Bombay Ghouse. Just the trio. If we slit this trio up... Everyone else will tuck their tails in. Who are we ramming in to first? Sunkenahalli Lakka! I'm standing like a rock. The pole however isn't steady enough. Let's get it drunk, shall we? Sure, brother! [IN UNISON] Jayaraj! Well, Jayaraj's here. Come on in. The entire gang's here with you. Maali, bring Biryani for all of them. I'm here to discuss something with you. [IN TAMIL] Tell me, Jayaraj. I'm forming a mob in Bangalore with people like you and me. Join me. Fine. Who'll be the King of the mob? What do you mean? Obviously, Jayaraj is the King. I can't work in a team, Jayaraj. You are the King of your locality, and I'm the King in mine. Why do we need a group? You only have two choices. Join us or... Hanumanthanagara, Kalasipalya, Shivajinagar, Guttenahalli, K.R. Market, Frazer Town, Basavanagudi, MG Road, Majestic. Apart from these four areas... - Apart from these three areas... Everything else is yours. Do as you please. Looks like you've distributed Bangalore among yourselves? Bangalore is entirely mine. If I tie up my dhoti and get my hands on a sword... Do you know how many men I've finished, Jayaraj? Don't do this, Jayaraj. Do you see how the pole shook? Lakka... But the pole won't headbutt you back. You're talking to 'Double whammy Ganapathi'. You don't need such a huge tool to kill a man. Jayaraj! If you even think of stepping in the Cantonment area, I'll chop you to pieces. Does your father run the Cantonment area?! Until I'm here, you think I'll let anyone else touch you Jayaraj?! Take him to the hospital and remove his guts. His double whammy won't do him any good. Neither will it do any good to the society. Jayaraj. - Sir? Nataraj has told me everything about you. Indira Brigade is not just a gang of young men. It should become an army that can lead the society in the right direction. Till date, only the Upper caste community has ruled Karnataka. We need to break the chain. That doesn't mean we treat this community as our enemies. We need to send out a message to those strong heads that we don't fear them any more. We need to empower the oppressed with courage and strength. Above all, we need to stand like a boulder and develop a strong attitude. That attitude should be our weapon. Politics is a smart act of grabbing from the wealthy and giving it to the poor. Apparently, MDN has found a powerful gangster for his team. His name's Jayaraj. His name's making rounds in every nook and corner of Bangalore. We can't just sit and watch any more, Master. Rao... Jayaraj is no big deal for us. Our obstacle is none other than... M.D.N. We need to wait a bit. The most important quality in Politics is... Patience. Restraint. At one point of time, MDN will slip. That is when... That is when we jab him. Our favourite leader, the friend of the poor, Urs - the Chief Minister of Karnataka, is here. We request our beloved MP Jayaraj to garland him and welcome him. Greetings to the President of Indira Brigade, the workers and my colleagues. The name Indira Brigade itself is enough to thrill us from within. It reminds us of the imagery of the great Goddess Durga. Together, all of us need to strengthen it further. Our party has unanimously appointed MD Nataraj as the State President ...and MP Jayaraj as the Bangalore District President. Right now, I wish to share my words to the wise. At no cost, should any of you cross the lines drawn by the constitution. Our constitution is strictly against acts of violence. My ministers and I have to rush to Delhi at the earliest. Mr. Nataraj and Mr. Jayaraj will continue to address the gathering. Master is a big man. He is beyond all of us. His words carry weight. I'm not sure if it reached you all. I only have one thing to say. Grab it from the wealthy. Distribute it among the poor. ALL HAIL INDIRA BRIGADE!

Apart from this, they need to pay me one more lakh. No matter the amount... If you've lent this much, you must have stashed a lot more, right? My guys will give you a Navtal lock. Shut shop and go back begging to your village. Brother, do I really need these threats? Cut out a deal for me. I'll pay up promptly. I don't want anything.

Moolah involved. What's the point of playing without any money? Thrill is everything in gambling. Who are you? Professor. A teacher in a college. Mister Professor! Instead of teaching in a college, what are you doing here? I teach from 9-5 in the day. Post that, I play as I wish. Do you even know what Head-Bush is? Head and Bush. Tell me what you know about it. What is he even asking us?! If you choose Head and the coin shows Head, you win. If you choose Bush and the coin shows Head, you lose. A coin and a toss. That is all you know. Do you know the deeper meaning? What's the big deal about it? Head-Bush is not just about gambling. Irrespective of the obstacles in life, the choices are always yours. Right from our breakfast to the clothes we wear, it speaks of our choice. It's your choice to choose your life partner. It's your choice to pick your friends. What you choose today, decides your fate tomorrow. How do we make the right choice? - Remove the connection. There should be no connection between the brain and heart any more. Put your brain aside and listen to your heart. Your mind will screw with you, while your heart will show you the way. Go in the path of your heart. Respect your choice. I'm here to play with you guys. Whether you let me play with you or not, is your choice. You there! Bring a chair. Professor, I shall take everything you have and send you with empty pockets. I challenge you. Everyone, place your bets. Head or Bush?! Putti?! Raja?! Wanna place a bet? Anyone? Time to show! Bush for the win! Take it all! It's our game! Boys, this is the last game. Wait! Let me flip for the last game. Go on, Professor. I bet on Bush! I choose to bet on the Professor. I call Bush! Place your bet. Jayaraj, just this one time, I'll play against you. I bet on Head. - This is how you play. Reveal the coin, Professor! Bush it is! Professor! You're damn lucky! Dear Connoisseurs of art.

No need for small talk. Finish the deed and let me go. No need to get cocky with me. Do you know who I am? I know. Chakravarthi told me about you. You're the boss, right? If I'd not agreed to come here, you would've slashed my face. I'm not scared of you. I was worried for my family. That was the only reason I agreed to come. If that's the case, why did you get into the show business? My father was in the Army. He lost his life in the war against Bangladesh. This country did nothing for him. Since then, the responsibility of my mother and siblings fell upon me. I only knew to dance. I quit college. Ended up in this business. Fate. It's all in my fate! Today, you're turning me into a prostitute. My fate! Let's begin. Let's do it. I'm not in the mood. Sleep. I'm sorry. Your fate didn't do right with you. Can I go now? - How will you? It's raining. Sleep here. I won't do anything. Samson, want to bet on this game? Sure. What are the stakes? You... You be by my side. Stay! Stay with me. Man you cheat a lot! - Fine. Quit bugging me and play. Ganga, Samson? - Yeah? From now, Reshma will be with me. Which Reshma are you talking about? The one who danced yesterday. You mean Monica? Yep. The red pawn has been trapped. Shush Samson! Will she stay with you? What about after marriage? Will your wife let her stay? I'll marry her. - Huh? She is enough for me. Maybe you should think this through? Samson... I'm not asking for your opinion. I'm stating my decision. - Well, erm... I can sense dignity in her. She... suits you. She suits him, right? - Of course. She's the daughter of a great soldier. - Really? Yes. - That's great man. You've taken a call that would impress Goddess Karagadamma. Things will go well. I know, right? Jayaraj? - Yes. Chakravarthi was telling me that he heard Boxer Anthony compare Indira Brigade to his foot. We should teach the boy a lesson. Time for a show. What say, Samson? His as* must be itching. Let's give him a scratch. Watch your foot work. Move! Throw in that jab. What's up, Jayaraj? Here to show your prowess? Anthony, you're no Muhammad Ali for us to put in all the effort. Dipsh*t! Looks like your showing off a lot these days! Heard you're going out and badmouthing Indira Brigade. Got something up your a**?! Samson. Did I say anything wrong? You're rookies who walked in a couple of hours ago and you want your own wing. Compared to our Youth Congress wing, your Indira Brigade is equal to my foot. Anthony, why are you raking up things? Can't you shut your fuc**** mouth and stick to boxing? Ganga, I don't need to listen to you. You're a puny rowdy. I on the other hand, am an athlete. Boy here needs a bit of tuning. John, he thinks he can tune me. Jayaraj, you are a dusty old wrestler. I'm a Third rank National level boxer. Looks like all the old fashioned push-ups and squats have only slowed you down. I'll fight you alone. Is it? You think you can fight me alone? A small piece of advice. Go back to where you came from. Your face has a charm to it. But I'll break it. What the heck do you think of Indira Brigade?! Indira Brigade stands for Bangalore. - Let me go. All hail Indira Brigade. Clearly it's your Youth Congress that just bit the dust! All hail Indira Brigade. Jayaraj, put in a word for Venu. Why not? We'll get it done. What is it? Ganga's brother Venu should carry the Karaga throne next year. Please talk to Master and get it done for us. I'll get it done. Come on now. Come in. Where are you running off to, Rahul? Uncle, you are Jayaraj, right? I want to become a big gangster like you. So much for ambitions! Come with me! Master's daughter. My mother too had told me. Not to get into Rowdyism. Well... There's something you should know, Jayaraj. I'm trying to do good to the society. But an IAS officer is constantly meddling around. He needs to be put in order. Oh no! I'm sorry, Sir. Don't touch me. - I'm sorry. Can't you watch it while you walk? Get your hands off me! Sorry. - Nonsense! Where did the blood come from, Sir? What a lesson you've taught him, Jayaraj! Master has no opposition in the entire state. But some people in our party have ganged up to prick him about trivial matters. We need to send out a message that the Indira Brigade will not tolerate such nuisance. Jayaraj, everything's here. But one thing's missing. Want some fish or crabs? Kutti go out and... No. He isn't asking for that. Jayaraj... Every cabaret is now under your control. Why don't you call in a couple of them? How about this instead? Ask your wife and sisters from the village to come over. We'll have fun with them. You can have fun with the cabaret girls. Jayaraj, you didn't get me. I'm not talking about private properties. I mean the public ones. Big roads, Government Buildings, Parks and the Parliament are all public properties. My wife and I, my jewellery and car are all my private properties. I'm asking for the public ones. Get a couple of them here. Am I right? Your party has appointed me as a leader. But you are trying to turn me into a pimp, huh? Jayaraj! - Step back. Walk back! Stand over there! - Don't touch me. Guys, strip these bobble-heads! Savouring all the liquor and kebabs, you guys have turned into meat blocks! Jayaraju, shall I make them take off these boxers too?! Just stripping these scoundrels won't do. A parade through the Double Road junction will do the deed. Please, don't. Our family will then find out about it. Please, let us go. Wait! I didn't mean the actual Double Road in the city. Turn around. I meant this Double Road junction. One swish and for the next 90 days there will be no wee-wee or poo-poo. You won't even be able to fart. Double Road?! DOUBLE ROAD JUNCTION?! Mr. Gowda... His message wasn't intended for you. It was for us. He's demoralised us to the hilt. He's humiliated us. If we still continue to watch it silently. We'll be washed out. Urs Sir shouldn't have involved this dirty fellow MDN in his politics. I have desires too. Not the desire to be in power. Not the desire for wealth either. I have an immense desire to better the lives of the common man. Ay! Who the heck threw the slipper?! This tyranny, this act of instigation, this autocracy. I'm not someone who'll bow down to it! It is nothing but common for those voice out for the voiceless to get slippered! The more the slippers beat us, the stronger our stand and principles get. Throw whatever you wish to throw. Beat us with whatever you can get hold of. I will hand over the state of Karnataka to the hands of the poor. No matter who it is. I will face it head on. This is my challenge! What could it have possible done, Rao? He's used to it. Sir, Jayaraj is here. How many of them are here? - The entire gang is here. Send him in all alone. - Okay, Sir. Seth? Go in. We all know Urs is a great man. But we can't do anything. This is politics. What is this, Jayaraj? Trying to show off in my own house? Do you think I'm like those ministers to get scared? Khan. Why did you make someone throw a slipper at Master? What?! Me? What are you blabbering? Samson...? Sir! Who is he? - Speak up! Speak! - Wasn't it you? Didn't you pay me and Ramesh a hundred bucks to throw the slipper? Why are you bluffing?! Ganga, check if he's inside. Where the heck are you going?! Get downstairs! Walk, you dog! - Sir, please. Sir, he's Ramesh. Get over there! Jayaraj. You're still a rookie in Politics. This is a common thing in Politics. Ay! Khan! We understand that. If enemies or opponents do it, it makes no difference. But if your own companions pimp you out, nobody will tolerate it. Jayaraj! These guys don't deserve to be respected. A parade through the Double Road Junction... Samson. What is this? It was pricking me a bit. You! Get out of here! If any of you mess with Master again... How long will he throw his weight around? Rao... The man I prepared to break open the skull of Jayaraj, will be here. Are you Ramachandra Rao? Yes. Tell me. - Sub lieutenant in the Navy? Yes? There's a warrant against you. You'll have to come to the Police Station with us. What for? For running away form the Navy. I didn't run away. I left only after informing my battalion. Let the Navy be. What will you have? Biryani? Drinks? Please sit down. Let's discuss this while eating. Sir! Clearly he doesn't seem to respond to polite words. Neither will I respond to cuss words. Want to give it a try? CHARGE! Mongrels shouldn't try to hunt a Lion. Did I not ask you to have some food? Think you can shoot me? That requires guts. Not bullets. Welcome K.R. Didn't I tell you that I'm preparing a man? This is him. Ramachandra Rao. What do you think? He seems capable. K.R.? I need you to do something. - Tell me, Khan Saheb? There's a man named Jayaraj. Indira Brigade? Oh! He knows. I do. A huge body with a tiny brain? I on the other hand am different. When it comes to this matter, I stand with you, Khan Saheb. Do you know what they called him in the Navy? What was it? Kothwal... Kothwal Ramachandra Rao! Father, no matter what you've to say. I just don't like what Indira Brigade is turning into. What do I do, dear? Your husband was cribbing for not getting enough to do. We gave him the responsibility of Indira Brigade. He is not doing the work of strengthening our principles. I'm in a fix whether I took the wrong decision. How do you think we could rectify this? Father, he doesn't know how to take an organisation forward in a constructive manner. Father... If you give me permission, I'll handle Jayaraj. Good decision. I'll talk to Nataraj. From now on, you guide Jayaraj. Sure, father. I'll take your leave now. Take care. What do you even know about all of this? Neither do you, nor does your father understand this. He's a bloody ideologist. He's a Gandhian. Today's times require the Stalin approach. I'll make sure this brigade reaches never before seen heights. Violence is the tool. Fear is the key. Neither you, nor your father will understand the ground reality. Don't keep blabbering nonsense, okay? You're not even able to handle the alms my father threw at you out of pity. You don't even deserve to stand in the corner of my father's group. What did you say?! Keep talking. Let me see what you can do. From today, you handle Jayaraj. Keep him as close as you want. I will keep him close to me. Watch me! Jayaraj... I didn't like one thing you did. You shouldn't have been so rude to Khan and Rao. Do you expect us to stay quiet when someone throws a slipper at Master? You have no clue about politics, its process and intricacies. Neither does your MDN Sir. Politics is act of climbing up the ladder. When you're climbing, you'll find people grabbing you up the ladder. You'll also find those who'll pull your legs and make you fall. Thousand of people will garland you. Among them all, one guy will throw a slipper. To balance that is extremely important. Master knows that really well. Even Master isn't happy with your action. Anyway, you wanted to speak something with MDN and me. What is it? Well... The thing is... 'You love me a lot.' It's not tall, it's a lot. You're saying 'tall'. You mean to say a lot. Tall. - Lot. Tall. I... - I... Love you a lot. - Love you a lot. I really love you a lot. You guys are going to be uncles very soon. Really?! - That's awesome. What a great news! - My man was in a hurry. Let's feed all of Bengaluru! Superb! - Let's party! What a great news you gave us, Jayaraj. Karaga is just twenty days away. Let's celebrate it with a lot more grandeur. Oh! You're right. I'll be back. Let us all party! What is it, Jayaraj? You said it was something urgent? About the Karaga procession. Our boy has to carry the Karaga. That's not a big deal. You could have told me over a call. What is his name? - Ganga's brother, Venu. Our own Ganga? Let me call the Chief Secretary right away. Nataraj, just a minute. I was at Master's house yesterday. A lot of people had assembled. Apparently, some will be carrying the Karaga. Wait a minute. Please don't say that. It has to be our boy. It has to be Ganga's brother, Venu. Jayaraj, you should've told us before, right? It's too late now. It'll be really difficult. We can't change this. But... Please talk to Master once. You know him, right? Once Master commits to something, he won't go back on his words. Try to understand. - How's that possible? So much for his commitment. It's our right. These boys belong to the Indira Brigade. He has to change it. - How's that a right thing to do? Once father has committed, how can it be changed? Just because he's given his word, doesn't mean he can do anything. Nataraj, be sensible. - No. What are we supposed to do?! Nataraj, you're being very unfair. - Listen... It's okay. I... I'll convince Ganga. I'll convince him somehow. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] What's wrong, Jayaraj? Jayaraj? What happened? Apparently, your people went to Master and spoke about a Oh! He lives in the next street. What about him? He's been selected to carry the Karaga. Did you tell them that it's not possible? Ganga... I'm the one at fault. I was late in asking. Let's get something else done for your brother. This won't happen. Let it go, please? This is not happening, Jayaraj! Carrying the Karaga is a blessing for carrying out a penance for hundred years. I've promised my people that I'll make sure my brother carries the Goddess. I'll never be able to show my face to them. Instead, just slit my throat. Ganga, try to understand. Ganga... I understand. But Master has given his word. What can I do? I can't tell him to change it now. Just this one time. Listen to what I have to say. They need us to slit the officers. They need us to threaten the ministers. But for this, they choose him, eh? Jayaraj, remember this... Master is standing tall because of our power. Ganga! Master is above us. He rules the state. If we are something today, it's because of him. We stand because of his capabilities. Ganga! Why are you behaving like this for a Karaga? Listen to Jayaraj. What the heck do you know about my people? Stay quiet. I'm talking to Jayaraj. My dear boy! I've grown up with all of you. I know about all kinds of people. What do you know?! Do you know how much hard work my brother puts in? He wakes up at 3 A.M. and takes a cold shower. He carries the *** idol and runs for three hours. He has no vices. He doesn't even go to a cinema or a restaurant. Tell him, Jayaraj. - He's right. Please see what you can do. Wait. Ganga! Master's would've thought through before deciding on something. Let that poor man carry it this time. Oh! Was it wrong of me and brother to have been born in a wealthy household? Ay! Ganga, let it go for once. Mr. Lawyer! Stay away from this. Kutti! - Ay! Jayaraj, don't take it personally. From now on, I won't be with the Indira Brigade. What?! - Really? Ganga. Jayaraj, he thinks we built the Indira Brigade just to get his brother to carry the Karaga. Ask him to stay quiet, Jayaraj. Did you form the Indira Brigade? Speak up! Jayaraj, tell him to shut up. Does Indira Brigade entirely depend on you? Jayaraj, he's crossing his limits. You think Indira Brigade will bite the dust without you? Samson! All of Bengaluru is ours. No loony can say otherwise. Nobody gets to question us! Every street out there is ours. Get lost, kiddo! Who the hell are you talking to?! - Take your hands off me! I'll stomp you right here, Let go! Samson! Ganga! If you provoke me... - Stop both of you! Shut it, as*hole! - Stop it you guys! Jayaraj, make it clear to him! I grew up in your wrestling arena. Just to prove all of these guys wrong, I'll build another Brigade. Ganga! Ganga! Oy! Jayaraj! Don't stop me! He'll become a thorn in our way! He's Ganga! Our very own Ganga! Where will he go?! Ganga! The fact that you left Jayaraj for such a trivial matter... I'm unable to believe it. Mr. Khan, this might be a trivial matter for you. But to me, it's an extremely important one. I don't care when outsiders despise me. But when my own people and family despise me, it is very suffocating. Listen, Ganga... - Khan Saheb. What do you plan to do, Mr. Ganga? I didn't recognise you. Think of me as a Politician. He's the next contestant in the minister's election from Shikharipura. I will build a team just like the Indira Brigade. I'll make sure Indira Brigade bites the dust. I'll bring in men from every street out there. I need your support for that. Will Jayaraj be okay with that? Indira Brigade doesn't belong to Jayaraj. MDN and Master own it. I'm pissed with the gang members. We can understand your anger, Mr. Ganga. But today, Indira Brigade is an enormous tree that stands tall. To save that, you need to hit it at the root. What do you mean? Jayaraj needs to be... Can you do it? - Ay! What the hell are you saying?! If someone else had uttered those words... Kothwal! I knew it when I saw Ganga's face. He's not the Gangadhara, the Lord. He's Ganga. He's Goddess Ganga. You don't go against Jayaraj. Your heart won't be able to take it. Just like Goddess Ganga... Feel free to cleanse Jayaraj from the top to bottom. Dammit! The snake has entered the anthill. Brother. Come sit. Don't feel bad, brother. Looks like I'm not destined to carry the Karaga. Why do you say such things? Next year, you'll be the one carrying the Karaga. Got it? I'm going to Shrishaila. Good. Go ahead for a couple of weeks. It'll take your mind off these things. I will not be returning. What are you saying?! People in Bangalore don't value words. I don't want to live here any more. - Ay! Venu! - Don't stop me! Venu! Venu! Jayaraj was the one who was wrong here... He should've been with Ganga. Kutti! Nobody cares about you guys. You've been disowned. Jayaraj has disowned you! You are street mongrels now! Shame on your useless lives! - As*holes! I met that ****, Samson! What did he say? He called us street mongrels and mocked that nobody cares about us. Why the hell didn't you stab him right there?! I would have. But what about that monster, Jayaraj?! Would he have spared us? GOVINDA! [CROWD CHANTING IN UNISON] Govinda! Govinda! Govinda! Govinda! [CROWD CONTINUES TO CHANT LORD GOVINDA'S NAME] Ay! Ganga is here! Jayaraj, let him come to us. He's our Ganga! Don't go, Jayaraj! Be careful dear. Take care of her. GOVINDA [IN UNISON] I knew you would come, Ganga. Come along. What is it, Ganga? - Let's dance a bit? Sure. jayaraj..... Ganga?! You...?! Jayaraj! GANGA! Hello? - Jayaraj has been attacked. Who did it? - Ganga. Jayaraj. I feel boss won't make it. Your boss' head is filled with sh*t! He will be okay. CHEERS! [IN UNISON] I told him that Ganga will end up becoming a thorn to us. I told him we had to finish right and then. But he didn't listen to me at all. Look where we are today. If something happens to boss, I'll won't spare anyone in Ganga's clan. They stabbed our Guru! Doctor? How's he? He's been gravely injured. In such situations, it's very difficult for a man to survive. Rao? - Hmmm? Call the hospital. Check if Jayaraj's body is undergoing post-mortem. Let's give him a visit in the mortuary. Has Jayaraj's body been sent to the mortuary? Will he survive? Trust me. He's going to survive.. He's only trying to survive. - What?! Jayaraj has survived. Looks like Goddess Karagadamma doesn't approve my action. None of you have to worry. Let him come. I'll face him. I'm with you. Nothing will happen to you. [IN TAMIL] If ever you need anything, ask and I'll be there. Allah has saved you. God is with us. Everything will be alright. Jayaraj, get better. We shall fight. He has nowhere to go. We will get our hands on them. God is there for us. Samson, you take care of him. GANGA! Ganga! Please listen to me. The situation is not good. Stay out of Bangalore for a couple of days. Once the situation is under control, I'll bring you back. Mr. Khan, no need for any of that. Inform the police you know. That is enough. It's not that easy. Mr. Ganga! The Chief Minister is the Supreme power. No matter how much we try, the Police are always on his side. It's not just the Police who are on the lookout for you. Jayaraj and every other tom, dick and harry. He's advising for your own good. Listen to him. I can't do that. Ganga! If I was in your place that day, I would've cracked his skull open with one hit! What did you say?! Is Jayaraj your enemy? Mind your fuc*ing business and focus on your elections. Don't get involved in this. Ay! Sit down! Can't get his shi* right but gets all cocky. Ay! - Kothwal, please. Sit down, Ganga. Sit. Ganga... Won't you value my words? Let me handle this. You'll be safe. Let me think about it. Let him stay back. Let Jayaraj kill him. Kothwal... If Jayaraj attacks him... And finds out our involvement in the Karaga attack. That madman will barge into our homes. That is why I'm asking him to leave the town. Khan Saheb. From now on, Jayaraj... ...is my responsibility. ALL HAIL JAYARAJ BROTHER! [CROWD CHEERS IN UNISON] [CROWD CONTINUES TO CHEER] Where's that *****, Ganga?! Until I'm here, you think I'll let anyone else touch you Jayaraj?! Where is Ganga?! Where the hell is he? That *****, Ganga! Where is he?! It seems that things are getting out of control in Bangalore. Yes, Madam. I'll take into control. - Please see to that you do. You should've slept. Jayaraj, why don't we both do this? Let's go back to Punjab. Let's buy 25 acres of land. I'll work in the fields. Together, let's take good care of the child. Let me finish this one final job. After that, I'll do as you say. I have to attack my partner! I'm struggling to do that. But I have no other go. Let me finish doing this. You've been saying the same thing for the last four months. What if you never find him? How long do you plan to live like this? This is too much. Let's just leave. - Dear! You don't get it. People will call me a pus*y! Come what may! There's no way I'm going to my grave without finishing that bas**rd! Pus*y! Ganga got five men to kill you. You're taking twenty men to finish him. That makes you also a... - Reshma! Do you mean to say that I'm a pus*y too?! What else do I call you? A soldier?! A warrior?! What do you expect me to call you? You are a pus*y! So is he one! You all are one big pus*y! Not here! Punch me here! Hit me here! Kill me! Choke me and free yourself! Take it! Take as much as you want and leave! You only two things. Money and Violence! You know nothing else. Reshma! Reshma! Reshma? Jayaraj, I love you a lot. But I'm still leaving you. This is for our child's future. I will not return. Don't look for me. Where is Ganga? - I don't know. Where the hell is he?! If you don't tell me, I'll rip your throat and hand it out to you! Samson, I wasn't the only one at fault. Son of a bi*ch! How dare you guys attack Jayaraj?! Kill me at once! Why are you guys torturing me?! Samson! - Kill me. They've broken my leg! Please tell them to let me go! I beg you! I'll fall at your feet! Please let me go! Where is Ganga? Brother, please spare me. Kutty knows! Please let me go! My legs! We won't let you go until you answer. Speak up! - God! My legs! I'll tell you! The Seth and the ministers did this together! My legs! Oh god! What's wrong? Let's behead that bas*ard Khan, Samson! No! Hell no! We'll end up screwing up! Let's discuss it with MDN once! Samson, we should not spare them! Let's no do this! - I can't bear it any more! They shouldn't be spared! - We'll ruin everything. Please listen to me! - Let me go! Let's talk to MDN once. We shouldn't do this. My dear boy! Calm down! Calm yourself down! Please! Sit down! Sit down. Calm down. No Jayaraj. Don't attack Khan and Rao. I think it'll become a national issue. Let it be! I'll face it! You don't stop me. Jayaraj! Don't be impulsive! Your impulsive actions might hurt the Master's position. Let's do as MDN suggested. Kothwal sir! I'm done for! I'd already suffered a lot of losses. It's all over now. If we let him be, he'll barge into our homes. Please do something, Kothwal. You relax, Seth. I have an idea. Why did you come, Ballal Seth? You think you'll be spared just because you came? Jayaraj sir! You didn't just attack my store. You attacked my entire life's work! I fall at your feet! Please let me live. What do I get from sparing you? Tell me how much you need. To hell with your money. Where's Ganga? I'll give you all the information about his whereabouts and movements. But please don't let anyone know that I was the one who told you. Let me live. Please, Jayaraj sir. I'm appointing B.N. Garudachar as the City Commissioner of Police. Prepare the order letter. Ask him to take charge immediately. The public is discussing that Bangalore has no Police and that there are only gangsters around. Gangsters are viruses that destroy the societal peace. This has to stop. Sir, the issue isn't with ordinary gangsters. It's because of the Indira Brigade. No matter what brigade it is, you'll have to put an end to it. When we bring it up, MDN sir screws us left, right and Center. Sir?! When did MDN become your Sir?! He's just an ordinary MLC. I'm the Sir to all of you. Bring in all the rowdy elements of Indira Brigade mercilessly. We should inflict twice the amount of pain they inflicted on the others. Spare no one! Sure, sir. Stop right here! Get the hell up! Thrash them. Drag him in! - Why are you doing this? Where the hell is Ganga? We can't find him at all. Grab all of them! - Take your hands off me! Sir, please don't do this. Let me go! Don't do this! It's burning! Let me go. What wrong have I done? Why are you arresting me for no reason? OH MY GOD! Jayaraju! Thrash him hard! Give it to them! [INDISTINCT CRIES] Don't beat me, sir! How dare you! - Please, don't do this. Hello? - They've arrested all of my men. They're being tortured. Look into it once. Sorry, Jayaraj. - I'll see what I can do. Who is it? - Commissioner? This is MDN, the MLC speaking. Tell me. I heard you've arrested the men from Indira Brigade. Mr. MDN... I'm in a very serious meeting. I'll call you later. Nataraj, what's wrong? What else could go wrong? All of this happened because of you and your father. Just because he faced some pressure, he's appointed that lunatic Garudachar as the Commissioner. That man listens to no one. Accept it at least now. You've failed completely in handling the Indira Brigade. Poor guys! - Rathna! The cops must be hurting them a lot. - Rathna! You cannot ignore me. What do you think of yourself? Do you own this damn state?! Stay in your limits. Don't try to command me, Mr. Nataraj. I'm answerable only to the Chief Minister. I'm a political leader. Sir! Please ask him to stop barking. Otherwise, kindly permit me to leave. Nataraj, please stay outside for a while. You're not supposed to send me outside. You have to throw this arrogant officer out. How dare you call me a dog! Nataraj! Go out for a while. Garudachara, don't mind him. Sir, leave it. I started the Indira Brigade hoping to spread my ideology to the public. But then... - Sir! Every officer out there knows what you are. Not just me. Please don't be affected by this. We know where we're going wrong. No matter how efficient we are... It ripples here. It ripples in the heart. But one thing Mr. Garudachar... You do your duty. No matter what others say. Sir! I genuinely wish to tell you something. No big man is a hero to his driver. As they say, no man is a hero to his vanity. But you are my hero, Sir. But this man here. He's a black mark in your illustrious career. And it'll be mentioned in history. Again and again. I feel very bad about it. Sons of bi*ches! Did they beat you a lot, Samson? They tortured me mercilessly. F*ck them! Let them beat me up! No matter how much they torture us. We will never leave you. The cops can *** ! Jayaraj, I spoke to father. From now, none of the boys will have to suffer. But... You have to promise me one thing. There's already a warrant on Ganga. His life depends on you in the witness stand. He'll be jailed for ten years at any cost. So, please give up the idea of going after him. You... You don't need that. Jayaraj, if you can promise this one thing... To be a gangster. To be the head of a mob. To proudly strut being the Indira Brigade. Were these my dreams? MDN hand picked me. He left me with Master. Let me tell you one thing. I've never killed anyone for myself. What was my fault in the Karaga incident? Did I create that issue? That dipsh*t Ganga... Blamed me for the incident and attacked me. He chose to stab me from behind. If I don't hit back at him... People will think I'm useless. We'll be wastrels! I've considered you as a Goddess. If there's one person in my life that I've never looked in the eye... That is you. I beg you! Don't try to stop me in this matter. Please don't tell me anything. Mr. Khan, Ganga speaking. Tell me, Ganga. I'm attending the court tomorrow. I can't just sit like a duck. If I don't appear tomorrow, they'll file a proclamation against me. Don't do it. Think it through. You think about what I'm telling you. But it's not so easy... Will he fight me? Let him. I shall fight back. Either he will live or I will. Even if we meet only once, I'll chop him down. Okay, Ganga. You attend the court. I'll arrange the security. Whether security is present or not, I'll attend the court. Let worse come to worst. I'll face it. Inspector? The police force is not here to protect the offenders. You'll do this instead. Tomorrow, the North Korean Ambassador is visiting the city. Except for the skeletal staff in the station, all of you go to the Airport on duty. Okay? - Yes, Sir. Hello, Jayaraj Sir? This is Ballal Seth speaking. - Tell me. Today, at 11 A.M. Ganga is attending the court. Is the information verified? 100% verified. Samson! In the next 15 minutes, he'll be in the court. The Goddess of Justice want justice to be done in her presence. Let's turn him into a sacrifice! Seth... Ballal Seth! Whether Jayaraj kills Ganga or Ganga kills Jayaraj... From now on... Bengaluru is mine. Prosecutor, are the witnesses here? They want time, your Honour. Is it? - Yes, Sir. Okay. 15:00. Next? - Ganga alias Thigalarpete Ganga! You're for the accused? - Yes. The accused is before the court. Oh! Ganga. Yes sir. You haven't appeared in the court in the last four months. What do you think of the Court?! Can't you appear when called for? I'll throw you in the prison. Couldn't you inform him?! He'll promptly attend the court from now. What do you have to say? I apologise. You better be here when called. - Sure, Sir. Order... Don't let him go! Finally, we meet you pus*y! Who the hell is the pus*y?! We grew up in the same wrestling arena. Pick it up! Pick it up I say! Finish it, Jayaraj. Only then can we both be at peace. Close your eyes! Close your damn eyes! It's you after all. Kill me, Jayaraj. I'll happily die. Jayaraj?! GANGA! Jayaraj, let's finish him! Let's not spare him! Let us kill him right here, Jayaraj! Jayaraj will face life sentence. Crime in front of a sitting judge? It's never happened in the history. You only have one option. Until the heat on this case dies, escape from here. If you escape, you'll be lost forever. Send a telegram to Delhi. For the first time an attack has taken place in front of a sitting judge, in Independent India. A lion should never turn into a fox. No, Jayaraj. Rathna doesn't get it. Don't listen to her. Don't worry about money. Get away from here. Whether you stand with you head held high and become a human... Or whether you'll go into hiding like a crook, you decide. The choice is yours. Mr. Urs, we need to shut down the Indira Brigade. Okay, Madam. I thought your intelligence pertained only to crime. Political intelligence too seems to be your forte. I am not like him. Keep watching. Watch how systematic Bangalore Rowdyism will get. Watch how stylised it'll be.
