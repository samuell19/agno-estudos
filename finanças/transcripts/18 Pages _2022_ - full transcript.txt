ANYTHING SPECIAL FOR THE BIRTHDAY? SHUT UP! COME EARLY IN THE EVENING. Sir. Your delivery, sir. Alexa, what's the time? Hi, Uncle. I WILL MAKE A VIDEO CALL. THEN, I CAN'T WAIT. SWITCH IT ON. Where are you? I'm on the metro, baby. What about you? I'm going to shower. Can you turn on the video call? I want to see you right now.-No way! I want to see the birthday girl. You'll come in the evening, right?-Sorry. You can see me then.-This is not new for us. We're used to it. Please!-No, wait. The people are going this way.-There's a thrill in waiting. Hey, Siddhu! Siddhu? What happened, Siddhu?-Can't you see it? Preeti is on the line.-Siddhu, I'm talking to you. What is she showing you?-What's wrong? Let me see it, too. Why don't you answer me?Siddhu! Preeti doesn't like itif a girl is by my side. Work, work, work. We all are very busy. Because of our time-constrained lifestyle, it's really hardto fulfill our social obligations. Your cousin who stays in theUS couldn't come to your wedding? Your girlfriend, who'sat the client's location, couldn't come to your birthday party? Is your daughter, who's stayingwith your in-laws, missing you? These are all the routineissues that we face. That's why AppTree Technologiesis introducing you to a brand new app… See U! With this app, your cousin can attend your weddingvirtually and can receive the guests. Your girlfriend can come to yourbirthday party and click photos with you. You can watch cartoons withyour daughter while sitting next to her. With hologram technology and 3D imaging, you can virtually go to any place. Even though there are some appsand technologies in this segment already, ours is the most portableand scalable app. Sorry. And right now, this app iscurrently the hottest thing in the world. The testing is almost complete. We are soon going torelease the beta version. Well guys, that's it.-Brother, kill it with your coding! Bye, guys. Siddhu!-Yes. Siddhu! What?-Hey! Siddhu! What's with the phone callsduring the presentation? Next time, put it on silent mode. Preethi texted me to meet her for dinner. It's her birthday, you know. So? Are you going? A surprise?

What would you do if I appearin front of you this very second? I know you have some work. That's right. It's really hectic. But if I was there, I could've seen the birthday girl. Damn! I missed a good chance.-You're just saying it, If I come in front of you?-but you won't come. Just consider it. I am almost in front of you. Hey, Preethi! Preethi? Siddhu? Siddhu! You were at the airport… One second. Siddhu! Preethi!-Siddhu! Siddhu!

And you're lying here drunk. The manager is gettingall worked up there. Get up. First, get up. Go and take a bath. Go. Shall we go? Will you come like this? What's wrong? Oh. Go and wear your pants. It is better to break up thanto get divorced like me. So be happy. Bro? When you saw them, in which position were they exactly? It'd be nice to know the details. I have a doubt, bro. What was your exactfeeling after you saw them? He wanted to give her a surprise. Who knows… Scoundrel! How dare you talk about girlslike this? How dare you comment on girls? Siddhu! Siddhu! Leave him!-Siddhu! Siddhu! Leave him!-Siddhu! Will you kill him? Why are you getting riled up by him? Don't misdirectyour anger to someone else. Or this will keep on happening. Give me the bike keys. Why do you need that? What the hell? Hey!-Venky, are you okay? Venky! Venky, are you okay? Venky! Venky! Stop it! Hey, Siddhu! Stop it! Hey! Stop him! Hey! Hey! What's this nuisance in the public? Come on.-Sir. Venky?-Get into the vehicle. What is your complaint? My house got robbed. Okay.-I suspect my neighbor. Greetings, Mr. SI. Mr. Sanjay! What's thereason for your visit? Is it because of your father? How many times should I tell you, sir? All the missing cases of senior citizensare considered suicide. Actually, I didn't come herefor my father. I came here for my son. He is your son? I'm already visiting the station becauseof your grandfather, and now you've become the issue. I was in an important business meetingwhen I got a call… that you weretaken to the police station. What's your concern now? That I got arrested orthat you missed your business meeting? Siddhu! Bhagi, start the bike. I didn't get the bike. I came with your father. Why do you live in a different housewhen we have our own house? Let's go home.-I don't want to. What's your problem?-Siddhu! What should I do if yourgrandfather left the house? I filed a police complaint. I am taking the help of my acquaintances. I am trying my best. Have you ever called us? Your mother is worried because of you. You don't have any concerns for us. If you had any concerns, my grandfatherwouldn't have left the house. Siddhu! No!-You know nothing, Bhagi. First, go and get him home. I will think about it later. Don't you have Facebook? Nope. Why? I have no idea. If you have an account,you can post photos. What if I post? Everyone will see them. And then? You would get a lot of likes. What will happen if you get likes? I mean, what will happen if I get a lot of likes? I don't know. Exactly. You don'tknow what will happen. That's why I'm not using it. So, you don't use a phone? Nope. Why? I never felt it was necessary. Come on! Come and hit me! You bloody… I'm Nandini. I studied BSc Agriculture. I'm from Alajangi,-Alajangi? Vijayanagaram district. Post box number 535573. The sun is lazily rising. A girl in front of me is clickinga selfie to capture this memory. Everyone is like that. We think of turning all thisbeauty into memory and keeping it. But what would be in a selfie? The sun will be present. The rain will be present. But the feeling we had whenwe saw them won't be in the photo. That's why I liketo write a diary, I guess. Along with the joy of seeing it, the feelings we had when we saw itcan also be captured in the alphabet. If something that happens turns into amemory, only then it will become a memory. The things we rememberwill be the life we lead. If we don't remember the dresswe wore, the restaurant we went to, and the things we talked about, then have we even lived in that moment? The things I am writing down in thisjournal were not the moments I spent… These are the moments I lived. I came to Hyderabadfor the first time. Come! Come! Cab, madam? No, thanks. My friend is coming.-Don't joke around, madam. These days no one comes to pick anyone up. Everyone takes the cab. Exactly. You don't use a mobile phone. If you had that, you could've booked a caband come home without any hassle. Sanju! But I wouldn't have seenyou as soon as I came here. I might haveto wait for another 45 minutes. Which I can't. What made you cometo Hyderabad all of a sudden? Well, I have to meet aperson named Venkatrao. My grandfather told me togive this cover to him in person. What's inside that cover?-I don't know. This cover isimportant to him. Hey! Hi, I'm Dr. Sandeep. I'm your new neighbor. We just moved in today.-So? Actually… Boss, boss, boss! One second. All my relatives came home today. We need to boil the milk. I mean, wehave milk. But we forgot the matchbox. Bro, everyone is waiting. So, I need a matchbox, please. One minute. Why is the whole flat filled with smoke? I don't have a matchbox. But I do have a fire, take it. Srujana. Hi, Srujana! She's like that. You come with me. We call them friends if theysit in one place and talk. But here, they are nottalking to each other. Sanjana introduced me to them. But first, she should introducethem to one another. Hey! Kill it! It's there.-Kill it! It's going that way. Hey! What are you doing?-Kill it. Look properly. Kill it, please!-What are you doing? Look there! Kill it.-Wait! Don't kill it. Will you eat that now? Should we eat it, if we kill it? As far as I know, a life form should not killanother life form unless it is its food. Perfect! You guys nailed it. I think there is no problemwith the presentation, right? Did everyone check?-Why would you eat a mosquito? If we kill something we should eat it. The client is goingto look at the beta version. If everything goes well…-Did you come from a mental hospital? I told you about the diary, right? The girl in it told me.-And Raghu, you take care of the PPT. I'm seriously fed up. Didn't she tell you anything else? What are you going to do with that now? Let's raise it. You take careof all the documentation. A periodic girlfrom a periodic movie. Made in 1990. There might be peoplewho would think that's cool. But can anyone be like that? You dated that girl for two years. You didn't understand her. And now you haven't even seenthe face of this girl. Is it necessaryto connect with her? She's very different. That's why I want to read this. Hi, Sujith. Hey, Bhagi! Arun will come for theclient meeting along with you. But Ajith. Siddhu was theone who did all the coding. So only he can answer all the questions. Come on, Bhagi. If hedoes something that upsets the client, we won't get any funding. And after that, we'll have to shutthe office and sit at home. Let's be honest, Ajith. Only he has all the knowledge on this.-Fine. If anything goes wrong, you both are fired. I know, right. Why did this girl come to Hyderabad? Nandu, take this phone and searchfor the location on Google Maps. You will find the address easily. You can go and give it to him quickly. No need. How will you go? I'll take the bus. It'll be a waste of your time. I have lots of time onmy hand. Don't worry. Bye. Sanju, please comehome early in the evening. Okay? Bye.-Sure. Why would we bother to ask each andevery person on our way for the address? It's called human interaction, Bhagi. According to Nandini's philosophy, the most important thing is the journey and the people we meet alongthe way and not the destination. Please don't back her up like that. There is no such philosophy. We need to experience that philosophy. Google Maps, off. Forget about human interaction, If we miss our meeting, we might have to face animal interaction. Brother! Do you know where is Sanathana Trust? Oh, Brother! Do you knowwhere is Rold resort? Look it up on the map. Oh, we don't need maps. We need human interaction. Isn't that true, Siddhu?-Yes. Where is it? Why do you need to know? I need to meet Mr. Venkatrao. The opened door over there. That one?-Yes. Thanks, Brother. Shit! Ajith. The client has leftafter waiting for so long. Oh, God! Ajith. I am really sorry, Ajith. You deliberately took Siddhualong with you instead of Sujith. I already told you that heis a very irresponsible guy. But you still did it. Now, because of that,we lost the project. Ajith! Shit! Bhagi, Nandini's philosophy is correct. But the client just left early. If I get a hold of that girl, I would hit her really hard. Sister, Sister! Happy birthday! Birthday? Sorry, dear. Today's not my birthday. Cake! Cake! Hey, Chotu! It's not her birthday. Leave. It's not her birthday. Mr. Venkatrao?-Mr. Venkatrao? It's been a long time sinceMr. Venkatrao came here. I guess it's beenat least a year and a half. Well, it's really importantfor me to meet him. I don't have his details. Look, dear. I heard that Mr. Venkatraomeets his criminal lawyer, Mr. Padmanabham at the NampallyCourt regularly regarding a case. If you meet him, youmight get some information. Lawyer Padmanabham. Hello! Hello! Hello! Sir! Sir! Please stop! Oh, youngsters! Thank you! Greetings, Brother.-Yes, sir. My car broke down. I need to get to the airport. I am getting late for the flight. Can you please give me a lift? Come on. Come on, sir. Thank you very much. I have back pain. Could youplease let me sit in the front seat? Will make you sit on my head. He wants to sit in front! He's an elder. Go and sit at the back. Come on, sir.-Good boy. Hey! My leg! What the hell! Oh! You are hurt? I am sorry. Sit on the other side. You'll be fine there. Do you have something to drink? No, not that. I'm asking for water. I want drinking water.-Oh, okay. Thank you. Is this mineral water? We are already doomed and you are asking all these favors.-Oh, is it? We are already so tense andworried. Just have what we give you. Tension? Why are you tense? We worked hard for threeyears on this app, sir. The client left without meeting us. That app? Is it similarto WhatsApp or Facebook? I have no idea what he is talking about. Will you shut up? I will tell him. This is not a normal applike WhatsApp or Facebook, sir. This is a next-level app. It's a super app! Stop it.-Why? Here is where you needto get down. You may go. Is it, dear? Bye, Brother. Thank you so much!-Bye, bye. Thank you. Brother, do you know whereto collect your boarding pass? There's a board there. I will take care of it. You may go now.-Bye. Thank you, sir.-Bye. Come and sit in front. Siddhu's not at fault, Ajith. I wasthe one who made the mistake. I was the one who madeher turn off the GPS. Actually, sir, in that book... Hey! Stop it. Actually... You both are fired! Miss you, bro. Are you happy now? I will take it.-Hey! All the best, bro. Thank you. Call me.-Yeah, I'll call. Go away! See you, Siddhu. Sir! Sir! Sir!-What? The client is on the call, sir. Let's go. Press the button. Wait, Siddhu! Siddhu! Siddhu! The client wants to talk to you. Please come. Hey, come on.-Guys, come. What's up, Bhagi sister? Are you doing well? How are you? Hey! Hey, Brother! Is it you? How are you? Are you fine?-Siddhu, he's the client man! Client? He's the client?-Client? Sir. Sorry, sir. I didn't expect you to beso simple. Hence I called you brother. Please forgive me, sir. No, no. It's okay, Sister. I'll be very general. Just like you people. Yes. Siddhu!-Sir. Look, dear. I really liked your app. And I liked your character even more. It's super good. What?! Look, dear. The app will be on the phone. But the one who uses it is human. I really liked your character. You said something… Yes! Human interaction. I really liked that. That's why I am givingthis project to you! It's for you! Enjoy! Jhanu, where is Sanju? Sanju! I'm talking to you. What are you doing sittinghere all by yourself? Hey, Sanju! The wi-fi is not working. Even my mobile networkis also not working. Please hand me your phone. Please hand me your phone! Hey! Sanju! What's wrong? Why are you crying? Kiran cheated on me. He was two-timing me with another girl. Wait. Let's troll him on social media. Use #cheater in your post. Yes, do that. You guys live in the same flat… but you don't knowwhy your friend is crying? Does she have to message you? Oh, my! Look at your eyes! They are so red. Hey! Wait! Sanju, may I tell you something? He didn't love you for real. If he really loved you… he wouldn't havebeen attracted to another woman. But he was. And that meanshe never really loved you. You didn't love him either. What are you talking about? If you really loved him, you would've forgiven himeven if you hadn't accepted his weakness. So, it wasn't really love, right? Where there is no love, there is break up and cheating. Hi, Preethi! I am extremely sorry, bro. I overreacted. Preethi! I am very, very sorry. Have a great life and all the best to you. Sorry, bro. Rain of seven colors in eyes Who is the reason?The reason is you I'm born just nowThough I exist for so long Who is the reason?The reason is definitely you Like the rain combined withThe cloud and the lightning Smile that came ontoMy lips because of you So happy when raindropsJump over the tender leaves I'm happy when my heart gets a memory Listen, Nandini, you came to meAs happiness My salutations to you Listen, Nandini, you touched meAs sweetness My salutations to you Sanju, where is the nearest post box here? A post box? Crazy girl. Who is the reason… That's not working. Why did youput it in that? They don't even open it. …reason is you They said nothing when I was home. After I came out, they said "Get well soon and take care." They are asking me to take the medications and all. Aarti, but what's wrongwith what they did? Have you ever cooked for them? Or at least have yousat and eaten with them? Spend one day without your phone. You will know how manypeople are there for you to talk to. Sister, I needto buy medicines for my mother. Please buy these pens. Sister, please.-Hey, Chinna! Come here. Here. Give me the pens. No, I won't give you. You look like a kind lady. These pens don't work. It's okay. Give me. Go and buymedicines for your mother. Okay? Ma'am, ticket? Earlier, you gave all your money to that kid, right? I saw it.-No… no, I'll get down. Here, keep this money. Why?-Keep it, dear. You also have to go back home. My duty is on this route. Youcan give it back to me sometime later. You would have your own languageYou can make even the rocks talk He stopped using his mobile. Bro, how can I send you the invitation? Post it.-Post? You don't have a phone, do you? How will you communicatewith us if you go out? A few talks and a few greetings Heart is overjoyed feelingTo have got a new voice I asked who you were What to do whenI get myself as the reply Asking where is the tide touching meSo I waited like the shore asking the sea My dad is a watchman. We have a lot of expenses at home. That's why I quit my studies. Don't worry. I will pay your school fees.

Hey, Siddhu, why did you stop?-Water pollution! Should be prevented! Hey, Siddhu, I'm talking to you!-Let's go. Water pollution!-Should be prevented! Water pollution!-Should be prevented! Pure water… Grandfather! Grandfather! Siddhu? Father! Grandfather! Grandfather! Please sit. Let's give him the best treatment. Siddhu, come on. Let's eat. I've cooked your favorite dishes. Where are you going? Why do you care? Let's go, Grandfather. Wait, dear. He needs to be treated. I just had a word with the doctor. It's very tasty. If he eats some pickles and some curriesonce in a while, it'll be very tasty. Dad, what he needs right nowis not treatment. He needs some love and time. Did you eventhink about his state of mind when he lost my grandmother, whom he lived with for 50 years? People go into depression. There is no one here to talk to him. That's why he left… And not because he is mentally ill. It's very tasty.-Siddhu! Siddhu! Siddhu, wait! Anyone can earn the money you earn. But the time you have, only you can give it. Tell me if you don't have thattime. I will take him with me. The 16th puzzle is…what brings us happiness? Anandi… that doesn't match. Sir, the judge is about to arrive. Wait, Sharma. I'm stuck here.

My Grandfather told meto give this cover to him. That's why I came here.-What's inside that cover? I have no idea. Mr.Sharma!-Sir. When is Venkatrao's next hearing? There are only three casesand you are turning 30 pages. Sir, he has a session on the third. On Monday.-Greetings, sir. Greetings. Greetings! Greetings! Do one thing, dear.

Where are you going? That welding shop guy! He's chasing Nandini. I will teach him a lesson. She's crying. She's not crying. She "was" crying. This happened a year ago.

We need to discuss the app paymentgateway tomorrow. Don't forget. Did you forget? Nandini is going to the courtto meet Venkatrao tomorrow. Nandini is going to court. I waited for Mr. Venkatraoat the court the whole day. He didn't come. Now, I don't know wherehe lives or how to meet him. Nandini, dear. Are you Nandini? Yes, I am. Were you the one whomet Lawyer Padmanabham and asked about Mr. Venkatrao? Mr. Venkatrao?-Yes, dear. Where is he? Mr. Venkatrao is sick. He told me that youare staying in this area. He wants to meet you. Would you be able to come, please? Oh! Is it? I will come for sure.-Please come. Do you have any sense? Crazy! When someone comes to you andsays that Venkatrao wants to meet you, will you just believe them? Someone is trying to trap you afterthey heard you talking to that lawyer. Why did you stop here? She got into the vehicle. Oh my god! Hey! Hey! Who are you? Bhagi! Open the door. Siddhu!-Hey, Bhagi. Come on. It's really urgent. Hey, Siddhu. What's wrong? Tell me.-Please, please! Just two minutes. I just need two minutes.-Two minutes, Dad Come on. My father will get a heart attack! Are you crazy? Why would you getinto any random vehicle? Nandini? She must be fine. Don't worry. How do you know that she's fine, tell me? Oh! My diary. Hey, why are you in such a hurry? Use your brain. If something had happened, how would she write the remaining pages? Who knows? They could'vedone something to her. What if she wroteabout all the trauma she experienced? How could I possibly readall that? I can't read it. Oh, dear! That's a storythat has already taken place. Please don't trouble me. Read the next page. Hey, Bhagi! I can lift a rockthat weighs a ton… But I can't turn a page. I'm shivering. Hey, please! Poor them. What did the plants do to you? Here!

But you didn't talk today. So I had a doubt. Uncle helped me. Yes! Yes!-Crazy guy. She is safe. She is safe. She is safe! Please, stop. Why would you pluck them?-She is safe. Hey, Siddhu! Where are you going? Why did you become so dull, allof a sudden? What's the matter? Now that she is safe, you should stop worrying about her. Have a smoke. But, I didn't save her though. I fear that she willfall in love with that Sandeep. I've gone sleeplessBecause of you. Hey, baby I feel pain in my heartWhen I remember you I've gone sleeplessBecause of you. Hey, baby 16 letters?

Bull… don't talk like an idiot. That is a story from the past. You are just an audiencein Nandini's story. Don't try to be a character in it. Come, let's go. Get ready. No! No. Get up! Siddhu! You are burning hot. Did you have a fever? There is a doctor nearby. I will go and get him. It's okay, I don't need him.-Shut up! Stay here. Please come, doctor.-Yes. Deep breath. No need to worry. It's just a normal fever. Okay. If the fever doesn't subsideor if you need any assistance, just give me a call.-I'll do that. Here's my card. Okay, Siddhu. Take care. Bye. I'll be back. Dr. Sandeep.

Siddhu, why did youstop there? Come inside. Make yourself at home. Please be comfortable. We just missed it. Come in! What shall I get you? Tea or coffee? No need.-You have come to my house for the first time, you must have something. I'll get something for you. Feel like you are at home. Okay? Hey, Siddhu! He ismore possessive than you. He hasn't put Nandini'sphoto anywhere in the house. The house is so beautiful. Now it's confirmed. She's our Nandini... Please keep calm, I beg you. There is no confirmation yet. Let's see. Shut up. I can hear the sound. Maybe they are romancing in the kitchen. Damn! I'm going-Please, Siddhu! Don't. Please, no. You tortured me.-No, please leave me. Please, leave me…-I can't put up with you. Please, dear. She is coming. She is almost here. She is here. Sorry, guys. I'm late.-Why is it always him? Why did you come? Where is your wife? Oh, my wife? It's her birthday today. Birthday? Don't get overexcited, it's annoying to see you get excitedabout someone else's wife's birthday. Sit down. He really loves birthdays. She went outshopping with her friends. She has gone shopping?-Yes. That means she is not at home. Where is the birthday party? The party is at six o'clocktonight in the clubhouse. Don't forget, you must come. Okay?-Sure, sure. It's in the clubhouse, right? Okay. Let's go.-Hey, one second, have some coffee, man. We are getting late for the party. Have some coffee. It's really good.-Some other time. Okay. Wow! What a pretty decoration. It seems Sandeep really likes Nandini. I will not come if you behave like this.-Hey, come. Your love is pure. Come. Excuse me, one second.-Hey, hi guys. Hi, Sandeep. How are you? Hi, thanks for coming.-Hi, Sandeep. Where is the birthday girl? Can we see her? She is about to cut the cake. You know what? I have planned a big surprise for her. Come, join me. Let's surprise her. Surprise? Come, come. Come! Hey, why aren't you having anything? Have something.-Come on. Hey, Sandeep, where is my phone? I can't find it. I kept it right here. It's my birthday today. I madea post on Instagram as well. I wonder how manylikes and messages I got. I am missing everything. Sandeep, look for it there. I wonder how many of my friends from the US and UK called to wish me. Can you please help me? You misplace your phone all the time. I didn't leave it somewhere. Did you forget it in the flat? No, I brought it along with me. I kept it here. I wonder where I kept it. Oh, thank God. I found it. I need to check the post... You keep forgetting your phone. Surprise! Special cake from Switzerland. Just for you, sweetheart. Happy birthday! You are not Nandini! Bro, she is not Nandini. Happy birthday! Brother, she's not Nandini. Bhagi, she's not Nandini.-Yes. What is this? For you. Hey, hi! Sandeep, you asked me outfor coffee the other day. Remember? Yes.-I was very impressed. Okay. My friend alsoasked me out for coffee. And I got the same feeling again. Okay. Remember you gave me a Ganesha idol?-Yes. I really liked it. Okay! But when I woke up today, my friendbought me this dress. Isn't it great? Yeah, it's good. Same feeling. I got the same feeling back then… Then it's not love, right? Well… We don't need areason to love someone. If somebody asks why you lovesomeone, you shouldn't have an answer. Sanju, you know what happened today?-Hey, why are you late? No, listen to me... Do you know thatVenkatrao came to meet you? I need water! Mr. Venkatrao came here? He told me that he'll meet you atthe Diwakar Children's Park on Sunday. DIWAKER CHILDREN'S PARK Mr. Venkatrao saidthat he will meet me here. If I give this cover to him, then my grandfather'swork will be done. I have to go to Kashi for myparents' death anniversary rituals. Sister, do you want m untha masala? Okay.-Sister, It's my specialty. Today, I will giveyou a different variety. His muntha masala is not tasty. Hey! What are you talking about? It's much better than your face. Hey… not like that. Just two drops of lemon juice. Only two? Okay, Sister. Add thinly sliced green chilies. Don't add normal salt. Add rock salt. No! No! Bring it here. Close your eyes.-What? Close your eyes. Sister, may I open my eyes? One minute. You are not cheating, are you? Come on, sister! Open your eyes. What happened, Sister?-Give me your hand. Sister, it's great. May I get some more? Can you tell me the secret? Sister, please. Sister! No, that's Nandini's secret. I won't tell you. Hello! Muntha masala. Coming, sir. Dear, are you Nandini? Yes. And you? My name is Venkatrao, dear. Is that you?-Yes, dear. Do you know how much I looked for you? Is it? Just a minute.-Okay, dear. Mr. Venkatrao is here. I will talk to you later. What would have happened? Nandini would have giventhe cover to Venkatrao and then must havegone back to her village. No, Bhaagi. All this while, while reading thediary I felt Nandini was with me. But now that it's over… I feel like she left me withoutsaying a proper goodbye. Dear, Siddhu. You fell in love with thewrong person in a hurry… but now don't miss the right personby not making a move fast enough. WELCOME TO THE VILLAGE OF ALAJANGI, VIZIANAGARAM DISTRICT. Village council. Granny, where is VastuVishwanatham's house? That house in front of you. Okay. Nandi… Madam? Who is it? Who are you, Son? Ma'am, my name is Siddhu. I am Nandini's friend. I've comefrom Hyderabad to meet her. Can you… You call yourself Nandini's friend. Don't you know about her? I know. I know Nandini very well. If you knew my Nandini… you would have also knownthat Nandini and her friend died in a car accident a year ago. Are you Nandini's grandmother? I have come to the wrong address. Sorry.-No, son. No. Wait. After she met with an accident… they were taking her to the hospital, but she died on the way. By the time I reached there, everything was finished. ROAD ACCIDENT.THE BRUTAL DEATH OF TWO YOUNG WOMEN. Sir. Dad, your queen is out of the game now. Check. Father! You played really well. Hey, Siddhu! The doctor advised him to play chessto strengthen his mental abilities. Look how much better he is now. Father! You played well. Grandfather.-You improved a lot. That's it.-Thank you. Take it. Siddhu!-Hi, Mom. Siddhu!-Siddhu! You didn't even call us. Actually… Dear, thanks for giving me my father back. Make his room ready. Lakshmi! Why are you going on a cycle? Take the car. It's okay, Dad. I'm comfortable with a cycle. Let's go! What happened? Where are we going? If she died in an accident, then there must be a police case. Let's find out. What accident? It's not like that, Siddhu! You'll be free only if you see her grave. Do you want me to force my brainto believe that Nandini is dead? Bhagi! Nandini wasn't in my life back then, and she isn't now. But she was always there. Bye, guys! Siddhu! Please, dear. Siddhu! Lord. Grandfather? Hey, Subba Rao! Don't hesitate, and eat as much as you want. Take some more rice. Grandfather?-Siddhu! Serve it!-Give it to me. Your health is not good, do you need to do all this? Siddhu! When your grandmother died… I went into depression. No matter how goodor bad a person is… when they die, we'll onlyremember their good deeds. If the person wanted to do something whenthey were alive, and if we fulfilled it. Then that meansthe person is alive, right? Annapoorna wanted to feed everyone. And now it's happening. See that's it. Grandfather. If we fulfill the dead person'swishes, then that person is alive, right? Yes!-Yes? Tell me, what do you want? Will you give anything? Yes. I will give you whatever you want. I want two pizzas. Which is the dream for which eye? Do any lids tell you? Which walk travels which way? Do any feet show that? Do you want a toy? I turn on music for the tunes in you Shall I run… Hey, don't you need anything? I don't want anything to eat. I'll get rid of my bruise withan operation. Will you help me?

Two drops of lemon juice. Add thinly sliced green chilies. Which walk travels which way? Do any feet show that? I turn music for the tunes in youShall I run as the song you let go? Close your eyes. I turn music for the tunes in you Shall I run as the song you let go? Sir, this isNandini's secret recipe, right? When the epic written by Nannaya stopped Tikkana completed that Krishna sang the melody Radha stopped in between When the epic written by Nannaya stopped Tikkana completed… Dear, who are you? I am Nandini's boyfriend. Krishna sang the melody Radha stopped in between Siddhu, there is a letter for you. Dear, Nandini! I'm Ramakrishna, conductor of bus number 41D. Thank you forremembering my helpful gesture and sending me 120 rupees. Dear, how are you? I was worried when I sawyou in the ICU the other day. I'm very happy that you arewell now and wrote a letter to me. I forgot to tell you. Your advice was extremely helpful to me. Mix a teaspoonof ajwain powder in a glass of water. My Asthma is completely gone now. Take care of your health. If I come there this time,I will meet you. I hope everything goes well. Ramakrishna. Who is it? A letter from a friend's grandfather. Come. You used to be on the phone daily, but now it's good you're doing this. While taking her to the JJhospital after the accident… What are you waiting for?-Give me a minute. She lost her life on the way. What are you thinking? Bhagi! Sir! Mr. Ramakrishna?-Over there. I'm Siddhu. I'm Nandini's friend. Nandini's friend? She is the one whosent you 120 rupees by post. Yes. How is she now? Is she fine? When did you last see her? We went to a government hospitalfor Saroja's bypass surgery. I saw her in the ICU. ICU? Do you remember thedate when you saw her? Yes. It was the 20th of January! I remember it well. Hello, Master! But there was news in the newspaperon January 18th stating that she died. How can you see her on the 20th? Siddhu, I think he saw someone else. He is close to retirement. No! I've seen her. She was Nandini. How you can see her? Sir. If you don't mind… Will you come with us to the hospital? Please. Nandini, Nandini, Nandini… The name you'vesaid is not in the record. Hey, Siddhu. Nandini is dead. Whether you believe it or not No! I and Saroja were herethat day. I've seen Nandini. She gave me a remedy for my health. So, I remember her. She was in JJ Hospital on the 18th, then how was she in thegovernment hospital on the 20th? They could've referred her to a governmenthospital because it was an accident case. Siddhu, all this is normal in such cases. Did I see her? Sir, have you seen her onthe stretcher or in the ICU? I saw her in the ICU. Did you see an oxygen mask? Mask? Siddhu!-Wait. Mask… Yes. There was. That means she was alive, right? Sir, did you see thedrops falling in the drip? Drops? Yes, it was dropping. That means she's still alive. Sir…-Hey, Siddhu! In the ICU there is a monitor. Did you see her heartbeats? Yes, the lines were moving. She is alive! Yes.-Sir! After listening to her…-Siddh… Now I'm feeling that she was not Nandini. See? Leave it, sir. Nandini was alive. You are just wasting your time. Sandeep!-Hey! Hey, Siddhu! How are you, man?-I want to talk to you for one minute. Yes, tell me.-Hey! Do you remember Nandini? Siddhu, what's this? I met her two years ago when Icame to Hyderabad for the first time. She is a nice girl. After that, I didn't meet her, bro. How do you know Nandini? I met her a year back. I know everythingabout your love story and letters. Okay, cool. How is she now? She is no more. She passed away in an accident. What?-How do you know? She's alive. The conductor saw her right? Bro, try to remember again. Have you seen her since the accident? Bro, I came to know aboutthe accident just now because of you. I don't know. Sandeep doesn't know. That's what I am saying.-Sandeep doesn't know but… Let's go.-Siddhu, what happened? SANATHANA TRUST. Madam. You came here after a long time. Yes, ma'am! Nandini was here two years ago, right? What did she say? Anything about her. Did she tell yousomething about her next plans? Mr. Siddhu. She didn't say anything. Rashid! Where did you last see Nandini? How can I know where she is? That was the first time I saw her. I don't know who she is.-Rashid! Please! I really don't know. I didn't see her after that. Nandini lived in this flat. Who are you? I heard thatyou've been looking for me. Hello, Narasimham! You're inquiring about me. What's the relationshipbetween you and her? Rashid said that she'll be in the park. I killed Venkatrao. Are you Nandini? You are…-My name is Venkatrao You are Venkatrao, right?-Yes, dear. If you don't mind, can you tell me your lawyer's name? Why do you need my lawyer's name? So many untoward incidentshappened while I was looking for you. That's why I'm asking you. It's Sundara Rao. You are older than me, so don't lie. He said he'd give me moneyif I said my name was Venkatrao. That's why I lied. Where is the cover? Where is the cover? I asked her to give me the cover. She didn't… and tried to run away. I pulled her hair, as she was fighting for her life. Did you pull her hair? Not only her hair, but I touched other things too. What happened? Are you hurt? You are bleeding. What else? What else did you do? You grabbed her hair. Take it. Take it. Tell me, what did you do next? Take it. Take it. Keep it. Keep it Where is it? Did you twist her arm? Take my hand. Bastard! You will break the girl's hand? You can feel the pain, right? Move aside! Move aside! Move! Move aside! Did you beat her until she bled? Did you beat her until she bled? How did you hit? Did you strangle her neck? Do it. Do it. Hit me. Hit me. Come on! Cool! Relax! You have to hit me until I bleed. Okay? Hit me. I'm a man, and I can't handle it. Poor girl. Can you imaginehow she endured it? How can you beat a girl? Speak up! Get up! Where is Nandini?-I'll tell you! Mojo. Mojo told me. Mojo.-Mojo told me. Who is Mojo? Who is Mojo? Hey! Hey! Who is Mojo? Who is Mojo? Tell me. I'll tell you. I don't know who he is. He calls us. Wait! Wait!-Tell me! It's a long story. I'll tell you if you let me breathe. Tell me! Even I don't know who Mojo is. He calls and tells me what todo. After that, he'll pay the money. This time he told me tosearch for Venkatrao. So, I assigned this work to Rashid. When we were following that girl, we got to know about Venkat'scover through Lawyer Padmanabham. Cover? We kidnapped her because of that cover. But she escaped. Where is the cover? It's there. I searched for it but didn't find that cover. And she escaped from here too. Go! Go! Accident? Did you do it? Poor Nandini. Hey! Hey! They'll attack and killyou because of that cover. If we find that cover, we will get some clues about Nandini. Hey, Siddhu! Are you blind? Eyes on the road. But the cover is neitherat the house nor at the accident spot. She could've hidden the cover here. I'm sure that it's here in this area. Think like Nandini. Think like her. Where is the post box here? That is not working. Hey, Siddhu! Siddhu! Go fast, go! She doesn't understandthat it's not working. Venkatrao! Sir, someone named Siddhuhas come to see you. Ask him to come in. Sir! I'm Siddarth. Hello? Hello, Mr. Agarwal. Everything's great! It's fine. You don't need to worry. Once the agreement is done, wewill go for the registration immediately Relax, sir! Sir, Nandini… Nandini, who? Sir, someone attempted to kill hersix months ago. Yeah. One minute, please. I think you are at the wrong place. You should go to the police station. Okay. Yes, I'll be on time. Nandini left a cover.-Don't worry. It had "Vajra constructions" written on it. Tell me. I think this is yours. Look. Mr. Agarwal, I'll talk to you later. Bye. Sir, I think this isour MNC office's layout. Would you please go and do your work?-Sure, sir Thank you. This is… just a layout. We've many layouts like this one. You can go through our website. You'll find a lot. But they tried to kill herbecause of these papers. This is just a useless piece of paper. But I'm sure that they tried to kill herbecause of this useless piece of paper. I'll find out why there willing tokill a girl… because of this cover. You can keep it. No problem.-Thank you so much. Mr. Rakesh, do youknow anybody called Mojo? Nice name. I don't know. Thanks for the information. Hey! Finally, Siddhu came toyou while looking for Nandini. He has that cover. Grab that immediately. You had been lookingfor that cover all this time. But when you found it, you just let it go. Now I want that cover urgently. Or… If not… I… I'm completely lost right now. The engineer has the same copy. The same copy is alsowith the GHMC and us. But why are you insisting on having that? What's in it? I want that cover. I'll get interested onlyif you explain to me with logic. Logic?-I want logic. What logic? Look! This watch is workingbecause of the battery inside it. That's logic. Here. We are eating this fruitbecause of the vitamins inside it. That's logic. So, what's inside that cover… This is a gun. And there are bullets in it. That's logic. How can I not listenif you say it like this? Anyhow… Thanks. Why? Because you said Mojo is a nice name. Joginatham Mokkajonna! Get that cover. Go! Who is he? I'm Mojo. Nice name. K. VENKATRAO 1-165/123PANJAGUTTA, HYDERABAD. What will you do? It's fun to watch cartoons. But don't watch it too much.-Oh! It's the cover. Madam, make her join a sport. Cricket, football. Do you like to play football? Yes.-Ticket! Ticket! Ticket! Ticket!-Hi. Ma'am, take the ticket! Where do you want to go? Give one ticket for Kondapur. This is Kondapur. How did I get here so quickly? Yes. Life is so short. Yes, sir.-I'm in Kondapur already. I got the cover too. Ma'am, take the ticket! What about you? Hello, Mr. Mojo. Do you think I'll give you thecover if you grab my collar? I grabbed your collarafter taking the cover. I don't care. The cover. WELCOME. A Tape? Mojo, what's inside that cover? Don't ask me about that! Cover! Cover! Ask me anything other than that. Do you have a treadmill in your house? No, Brother! I hate running, you know? Then you will hate me. Why? Brother! Stop the bus. Brother, please tell him to stop. Brother! Brother! To get on a running bus is in trend. Don't stop the bus. But it's not just the bus, I'm also running with it. Tell me what's inside that cover. That idiot is not saying what's insidethat cover. But he wants that cover. You don't know what's in that. But you don't want to give it to me. Here, I'm stuck between you two. Oh my God! There's a pillar. Right! Right! Right! Where is the bus? Where is the road? Why did you go after Nandinifor the cover? What's inside that cover? You are not following the logic. My boss didn't take the coverfrom you, and he sent me instead. Why? Because he wants tobe alive no matter if I die. Kings won't tell theirsecrets to soldiers. They just send them to war. It stopped. It stopped. Soldiers sacrificetheir lives for the king… But "these"? That's logic. Let's sit and talk. The person who hasfaith in the land is a farmer. This saying is for the village. But in the city, we call them builders. On that basis, he becamethe top builder in this city. His focus immediately turned to the Sanathan Trust in the city. People tend to believe in superstitionswhen they become rich, even if they were atheists before. They'll start to believe inastrology and V astu Shastra. That's why he sent the buildingblueprint to Nandini's grandfather, Mr. Vastu Vishwanath Shastri. I have seen everything. Of all your sites, this is one of the best sites. Don't leave the site at any cost. And because of that… Can you please keep it down? I'm tense. Please!-Tell me. And because of that, hewent directly to meet Baba. Greetings, Baba! Did you see the blueprint? It worked out well. I also received approval from GHMC. Baba, it's a beautiful place. Buildings and commercial complexes. Even Mr. Vastu VishwanathShastri approved it. It's enough if you sign it. We don't want tosell it or give it to you. You are disturbing us by sayingthe same thing again and again. This enraged him. On the same night, he sent some peopleto set the place ablaze. Six kids and Babadied in that fire accident. After Baba died, the trust appointed a new chairman. He got the new chairman to signand finished his work. Venkatrao, who is a student ofBaba, got to know about everything, and he filed a case in court. Although Padmanabhamhas been trying for a long time, the case is still pendingbecause there is no evidence. My boss was all relaxed when… Shastri sent Nandini to Hyderabadto give that cover to Venkatrao. I don't know what's inside that cover. Shastri, who died of a heart attack, Venkatrao, whom we killed, and my boss, only thesepeople know what's inside that cover. All that is fine… But where is Nandini? What do you mean, where is Nandini? She's already dead. I told you not to do this. I said that she died, not that I killed her. Keep your emotionsat bay and think logically. My boss wants that cover. Only Nandini knows where it is. Why would I kill Nandini withoutknowing where the cover is? You people, don't use logic at all. Then how can you say that Nandini is dead? I am the one who loaded Nandini'sbody into the ambulance at JJ Hospital. See this death certificate. You will get to know. Dr. Sandeep! Sandeep! Stop it, Siddhu. How many times should I tell you? I don't know anything about Nandini. I have to go. Patients are waiting for me. Why did you giveNandini's death certificate to them? Dr. Sandeep B., MBBS, FRCS. It's exactly 16 letters. I think this is your signature. Nandini wouldn't make any mistakes. If she felt that she was in love with you… then I can definitely say that you are a good person. My Nandini wouldn't make any mistakes. And you too. Nandini is alive. Nandini is safe. Nandini is with you. Bhagi! Nandini is alive. She is with Dr. Sandeep. Just tell me once that Nandini is alive Doctor, how is the condition of the girls who had an accident? Sanjana died, but Nandini's condition is critical. We are trying our best. I don't care what you do, but Nandini shouldn't die. But nobody should know that she is still alive. No matter how much money... Doctor! She is no more. Dead? It's enough. There are so many thingsthat Nandini has to do. I have so many thingsto do. I'll leave now. Do you want to see Nandini? Hey, Siddhu! Why are you leaving now? What should I tell her? I have done so much for you. Can you love me? She doesn't even know that someone called Siddhu exists. Nandini? Police have arrestedthe people who tried to kill you. How? Nandini, you are a good person. God will do nice things to you. Sister? Hey, Anitha-How are you, Sister? I'm fine.-When did you come? Just now. You've changed a lot. I have to say sorry to you. I promised you the otherday that I'd pay your fees. It's okay. I'm working for TCS now. Siddhu helped mewith my studies and got me a job. Okay, Sister. It's almosttime to leave for work. Call me right awayif you need any help. Don't forget. Who is Siddhu? Why did he pay the fee? NANDINI.SIDDHU. Hello, get up! That is Nandini's spot. If Mr. Siddhu saw this, he wouldn't like it. Please get up! Excuse me! There was apost box here. Where is it now? Oh! It's you! They closed it a long time ago. Grandpa, there was aSanathana Trust here, right? Sanathana Trust? An ashram… for orphans. Children were here for a long timebut this place wasn't sufficient for them. So Siddhu came and took thechildren to a new building. Siddhu? Where? Chinna! Sister! Is it you? How are you? I'm happy. My mother is healthy too. Siddhu helped me join a school. See! This is our Sanathana School. Santhana School is the same ashramwhere a group of orphans lived, right? It used to be like that. Butnow, it's completely different. Sister, this is our trust building. What's this? Sister, we're not allowedto use phones inside the trust. Sister, I study here. Sister, it's you? Hey! How are you? You said you'd come theother day. But you never came. I had to leave suddenly. But I remember that list. But you gave that list to him, right? To whom? Brother Siddhu. He gave us everything we asked for. Sister! Siddhu helped me get operated on. Look. Am I beautiful? Hey! You are so beautiful. Sister! Dear? You are Nandini, right? All this whilel thought that you were dead. I didn't know that you werealive until Siddhu told me. Sir? Who is Siddhu? Siddhu! The reason these orphansare living here is because of him. You failed to prove theallegations in the case. And by asking for further dates, you are wasting the court's time. I'm vacating this stay order. Mr. Murthy! The court needs the truthand evidence, not your emotions. Sir. I have the evidence. What's inside that cover? Sir, the building papers. With your permission, can lask Talwar a couple of questions? How can you give a civilianpermission for a cross-examination? I'm the judge. We still have ten minutes. You can go ahead. Thank you, sir. Hi, Mr. Talwar. When did you start the company? 1993. Vajra Constructions. Our ventures are in Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, and Delhi. You name it. When did you buy this trust? 2018. That means after thedeath of Mr. Baba, right? Of course, yes. I bought it when his youngerbrother gave us a proposal. So you bought the land in 2018? 2018, February. How do you know thatthere is land to buy? It's a prime property. We inquired about it, and we bought it. So does that mean youdidn't know Mr. Baba before? No!-You didn't know about the land? Of course, no! When did you startconstructing the building? Sir, please. 2019, March 20… No, no. We started the next day. It was an auspicious day. So, Mr. Talwar. In 2019... Mister! You had only ten minutes… Just a minute, sir. Mr. Talwar, when you don't knowabout the land till 2018… then how can you make the plan in 2017? What do you mean? Sir! Look at the date on that layout. 2017. Sir, how could Mr. Talwar havemade the layout for the land in 2017, when he doesn't know about it in 2018? If the 2017 map had come outbefore Baba died, then the truth would have also come out. Hence theytried their best to hide the map, sir. Not only does he believe in Vastu… but he also loves to makereligious sacrifices at midnight. In that act… along withMr. Baba, six children were also killed. God made a mistake bytaking their parents with him. Talwar made a mistake by killing Mr. Baba… who took care of them since their childhood. At least you shouldn't make a mistake. Make sure they get their ashram. Please. We received prime evidence for this case. File a case of criminalconspiracy and murder on Talwar. This court will personallymonitor the investigation. Siddhu came here to find you. Sir, do you have his phone number? What? You don't use a phone, right? Even Siddhu doesn't use a phone. Yes. Why didn't you tell me about this? He told me not to. He came to the hospital for you. But he left without meeting you. I want to meet Siddhu. I don't know where he lives now. How did Siddhu know that I was with you? Maybe the conductor informed himbecause he saw us in the hospital. I don't know the exact details. A boy named Siddhucame to meet you, right? Yes. Yes.-Do you know where he is now? Not Siddhu, but I saw his friend, Bhagi, somewhere near Gun Foundry. Let's go find her. Let's go.-Okay. Dear, Bhagi! Uncle? All of a sudden? Come here. One second. She gave me the ring back.-Uncle? Nandini? You are… Nandini, right? Yes. How do you know me? How would I not know about you? Siddhu told me about you. Youlook exactly the way he explained. Dear, Bhagi! Come fast. It's okay. It's my second marriage. Bhagi! It's almost time. He is my fiance. It's okay. It's his second marriage too. Nandini! Siddhu! Siddhu? What should I tell you about him? Siddhu means… the 18 pages that were written by Nandini. In the diary, you wrotethat Hyderabad is very cold, right? Then he came to Hyderabad in Maywearing a sweater while it was 42 degrees. You wrote in your diarythat someone kidnapped you? Siddhu was the one who wasfrightened the most at that moment, I'm not sure how worried you were. I told him to turn the page sothat we could know what happened. His hands were tremblingas he was turning the page. Do you remember writing a loveletter to Sandeep? He almost died. Nandini, then I realized that oneperson can love someone so much. I think that… his belief in you kept you alive… and made you fight death. After doing so much, then why didn't he meet me whenhe came to the hospital? What should I tell her? I have doneso much for you. Can you love me? She doesn't even know that someone called Siddhu exists. Do you know one thing? There shouldn't be a reasonto love a person. And there shouldn't be ananswer to why we love that person. Nandini, where are you going? I'm going to meet Siddhu. Today is an auspiciousday for me, but he is not here. He left, saying that he stillhad something to do for Nandini. No one knows where he went. I know. My parents' death anniversary is near. After giving this cover to Mr. Venkatrao, I have to go to Kashi. This is the only thingleft for Siddhu to do. I, who've been searching for Siddhu… understood that Siddhumeans Nandini's memories, Nandini's thoughts, andN andini's experiences. Siddhu? One minute. Stay on the line. Sorry. Muntha masala! M untha masala! Madam, muntha masala?-Brother! Sir.-Give me one masala. Okay, sir. No. Add two drops of lemon juice. There shouldn't be a reason to love… but how can we deny great loveb orn out of a good reason?
