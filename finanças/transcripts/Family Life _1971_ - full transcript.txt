Where do you live, Jan? In Harlow. What sort of house is it? It's all… it's all right. It's quite a nice house. It's one of those estate things, you know. Hmm. What does your father do? He's a storeman. What's he like, as a person? Yeah. He's all right. He's… He's a good worker, like, y… you know. He's had the same job ever since he left the army, and he never takes time off. And he's never late. Never ill? No. What about your mother? She a warm person? What did you say your name was? Mike. I don't like it here. Does it upset your, mother that, er, you've had so many different jobs? Oh, yeah. She says I am irresponsible. But I mean, sometimes I'd, I'd go to lunch and not come back again. Wanted to be an 'airdresser once. Had a Saturday job for a while in this place called Eve of Roma, down the High Street. I never really did any hair, you know, just sweeping up and doing things like that. Hold tight. Mind the doors. Do you live locally? When you were on the tube had you been to work, or had you just been shopping? I can't really help you unless you tell me some­thing about yourself. Joan, can I see you a minute, please? - I can't get anything out of her. - Nothing at all? Well… Look, I've been looking through her handbag and I've found out where she lives. And that is? Apparently she lives with her parents. I think we ought to contact them, don't you? Um, excuse me. It doesn't matter, really. I'll, I'll be all right. I can, you know, find my own way home. You don't need to tell my family. How do you feel now? - I feel all right. - Can I get you a doctor? No. No thank you. - Are you sure? - Yes. - I think you'd better... - That's it, get it in, come on. Thank you. Thank you for bringing her home. Thank you very much. All right. What's all this carry on, then? What the hell have you been up to? I haven't been up to anything. So the police just gave you a ride home then? Whatever's happened, Jan? Whatever's happened? - Nothing, Mum. - Are you sure? Yeah, really nothing. What do you mean? There's something must have happened. I was on the… I was just sitting on the tube platform, that's all. Not feeling well? You were just sitting on the tube platform? Yeah. And the police came and said, "We'll give you a lift home." Sit down. Sit down. Don't be so damn ridicu… What… what exactly happened? This guard came out of nowhere and he, grabbed me arm and stuff and… - You know. - He just… A guard came and grabbed your arm just for nothing? Yeah. He said I'd missed a lot trains. Oh, you might as well talk to the wall as talk to her. Well, what happened after the guard took you to the policeman? He said I… he thought I was a bit distressed. A bit distressed? But what were you dis­tressed over? What was the matter with you? I didn't do anything. No one said you did do anything. They're only trying to help you. - Oh, my god almighty. - You can't… It's not your boyfriend that's upsetting you, is it? Oh, Mum. It's got nothing to do with Tim, has it. We're not trying to get at you. We're trying to help. And your father is too. Just think of it on those lines. Other than that, I can't think what we're going to do for you. I'm only your father. I'm supposed to know nothing. I've never been around the world. I'm just an idiot. And you're tell… trying to tell me that, he's good for you, this bloke. Well, don't just sit there like an idiot. Talk to us, tell us something. What have you got to say about him, Janice? - This good-looking, big student of yours? - Talk to your father, come on. That little thing needs dusting, you know. That China vase thing. What did she say then? I think you ought to see a doctor, don't you, Janice? No. I'm all right. Janice. Janice. I don't know what's going to happen now, I'm sure. Come in, Mrs. Bailden. Let me have your coat before you sit down. I like to have these, talks with the immediate family of people in this ward. That's why I asked you and your husband to come. Yes, well, of course it's the parents they always blame first, eh, these days? They? Well. I read the papers, and young people, and in the court. Well, we're not in court. Well, I didn't say we were. But I do want to do the best I can for Janice, because I'm quite certain, that she isn't responsible for herself, poor child. Well, perhaps you could tell me something about her when she was smaller. Well, this is the thing that baffles me, doctor, um. She really was quite a model child. She was tidy. In fact, I used to go into her bedroom some mornings, and, it… it was so tidy it really didn't look as if anyone had been in there. And she… when she laid the table, oh, everything had to be just precise and she was this type of girl. And I often used to say to her or give her a little reward and say, "Oh, there's Mum's Janice, that's for being like Mum." Because that's the way I was brought up, you know. Would you like a cup of tea, Mike? Um, just, yeah. - Mrs. Bailden. Would you like some tea? - Yes, I would. - Thank you. - Yes, thanks very much. Thank you. Thank you, Cathy. - You see. - Would you like some? No, thank you. How much respect should these children show you? I've just noticed now your assistant just came in here and called you by your Christian name. You see, this is the sort of thing that's happening nowadays. Um, I feel that a gentleman in your position… a little respect should be shown to you. Come in here and treat you just as though you… you're their equal. The behavior is so, um, foreign to me. I just don't understand it. Um… You see them making love in the middle of the pavement. Well, is this the right place to do this sort of thing? I wouldn't think so. Who's making this code of living? Are we going to be dictated to by these young… the rising generation? Do you think this is going to be the right way to, tackle this thing? I mean, have I got to go and do what Janice is doing, for instance? - I mean. - Not yet. No, well, there you are. I mean, we're older than they and I do feel that they've got to take a guide from somewhere. And where are they going to take it? From each other? But… so in consequence they've got to show a little bit of respect for their elders. After all, if we are all going to do just this, we might as well go back to the jungle. ♪ Be on my side I'll be on your side, baby ♪ ♪ There is no reason for you to hide ♪ ♪ I've been staying here all alone ♪ ♪ Hoping that you'd take me for a ride ♪ ♪ She could drag me Over the rainbow ♪ What I want to know is who? I suppose it's one of your coffee bar friends, is it? Well, she doesn't want it. This is for sure. Who says I don't want it? Well, you'd be a very stupid child if you did. Very stupid indeed. What do we do? Get her an abortion? And don't mention that word in this house, please, if you don't mind. It's disgusting. And unchristian. You know how I always feel about it. And the people that do it, they ought to be put away also. Well, that's that then, isn't it? The point is, you needn't have it. Do you realize what effect this is going to have on your whole life? I'm not going to kill my baby. - Because it's there. - But you... it's me. I'm not killing it. And who the hell are you to decide? Who's going to bring the child up? Who's going to buy and pay for everything that will be necessary for the child? Have you realized this? You can't even keep yourself, child. Without another person. - I'll manage. - Is this going to be kind? - I'll manage. - You'll manage? And how do you think you're going to manage? You've just no idea what it all means. And if you're going to, be sensible, you'll take our advice and do what we know and feel is best for you. You say you want it. I say you don't want it and I know what's… what's good for you. Anybody would think you were inside my head or something. Yes, well, maybe I am. Maybe I… I've got… You're more part of me, than anyone else in the world. You know this, don't you? - And so's my baby. - And probably… How do you think we're going to be, to see you walking about in that position? - I'll go away. Don't worry... - Oh, yes, that'll be very nice. That's marvelous, isn't it? We've brought you up all these years, and you can walk out of the house just like that. For just being, a stupid child. I mean who says I'm in the wrong, anyway? That's it. You're the one, to say whether you're in the wrong or not. This is the most important thing you have got to decide. And it's got to be what you want. You see, I wonder sometimes whether you do know. You say one thing, and I know different. It isn't what you want. You say you want it, but I know better than that. You're my daughter and I know exactly what you want. It's just that, um… I really like kids and… well, I know it's the wrong way to go about it, but I mean, it's… it's there, ain't it? I could bloody well kill you. Do you see how you've upset your father, and me? Haven't we always done the best we can for you? And tried to guide you, in the way you should go? Haven't we? Have we failed? I didn't say you hadn't. You see, you're… you contradict yourself all the time. - I am confused. - You are confused, dear. And we'll try to… to help you and, and you know we love you. - Don't you? - I'm sorry. Never mind. Never mind. Um. It's very good of you to come along and see me. Oh, it's, uh, no bother. I was up anyway. No bother at all. Mind, um, mind you, I don't think the wife likes me coming here. Why's that do you think? Well, I don't think she likes me to come on my own, you know. Oh? Why not? Oh, well… Don't get me wrong, she's a good woman, Vera. Um, well, truthfully, that's why I've come. I mean, she, she's doted on this, girl of ours, and, um, I used to tell her, I used to say to her when Janice… she was getting a bit older, "You should be more selfish." You know, the way you, talk to your wife, and, um, I used to say to her, "You should get out a bit more." How have you always got on with Janice, Mr. Bailden? I wasn't allowed to, was I? Not in on it, you might say. I don't follow. Well, I always thought that, uh, Vera came, between me and Janice. Sort of prevented you? No, she'd… Vera wouldn't prevent nobody doing nothing. But when Janice was, a tiny tot, you know, I, we used to have bags of fun together. When she… when she was very small, but… somehow I don't think Mrs. Bailden liked this. Why not? Well. Why not? Well, frankly, um, I… I don't know whether you know, I came down from the North to work here. There was no work up there, and, when I met her, she had her own business. And, uh, I don't think they wanted me to marry her. They thought I was after the business probably. Mmh. Do you smoke? Uh, yes, thanks. Thought you blokes didn't approve of this? Have one anyway. Um. Perhaps you could tell me something about Janice when she was small. - Right from the start. - Thank you. Yes, she was… a very happy child. There was never any, unhappiness and there was never any naughtiness with her. In fact, I'll go as far as to say in those days, it was Janice that kept us together. Did you need to be kept together? Well, uh, you know, when you're first married and you're, you're sort of adjusting to one another, and, I suppose this is the way it goes in marriage. What about the, sexual relation between you and your wife? Well, she's… I can't grumble really because she's, she's been a good mother, and she's looked after the children and the house, and… Yeah, but I mean the sexual side. Well… She… she's not like that, really, Vera. I mean, um, she had a good upbringing, and… she's… she's funny about it, really. When I say funny, I suppose, I don't know, If I'm standing there and I've had a bath or something, she… tells me to get covered up and things like this, you know, aft… Even after all these years and… But she's always taught the girls, right from wrong, I think, in these matters, you know, about… men and… Well, you know the way women talk to daughters and… What about the… actual sexual relation be­tween you and her though? Well… I suppose it's… fairly normal. Um. Well, we've… we've had two children, haven't we, and… But I mean, do you, do you find it, uh, satisfying? Well. Well, frankly, I… I don't know what this has got to do with, uh, Janice being sick. I mean, my relations with, with Vera. I mean, she's a good woman. I… I can't fault Vera. Well, not really, she's… Well. Probably at times I could have, um… She could have done better. I… I don't know how to put it, but… Yeah, I suppose lots of married women are like this, aren't they? She, um… Well, shall I say she's probably done her duty in that line. But… You learn to live with these things, don't you? I thought you'd disappeared. I've been ill. Ill? Why? What's been the matter? Nothing much. What do you mean, nothing much? I'm better now. Are you? - Tea? Coffee? - Tea, please. So you're not working then? What does the old bat think about that then, eh? See anything of Tony then, lately? Do you know my mother's trying to kill me? What do you mean, Jan? She is. She killed my baby. Your baby? What are you talking about? Son. What baby? My son. What's the matter, Jan? What are you talking about? You sit down. What do you mean, your mother's trying to kill you? She… she made me go to this hospital. She is trying to kill me. Come along. What makes you think that, Jan? She… She cut out my baby because it was bad. And, now… And I am young, bad too. Why are you bad? What's bad? What do you mean? Because… because I'm always in trouble, all the time. And I… Every­thing I do, I'm in trouble. And that's bad, isn't it? - She is going to kill me. - She's not going to kill you. Get yourself in a state, don't you? Eh? Have some tea, eh? Feel a bit better. I'll get you some tea. Do you think I'm mental? I don't know what being mental means. Well, peculiar then. Well, I suppose you're a bit peculiar. I mean, everybody's a bit peculiar, aren't they? I don't know, I never really thought about it. Well, why don't you leave home? Oh, I can't. What do you mean, you can't? Well, I can't. It would upset my mother and… Well, is that a bad thing? You see, Tim, when, when it comes to making a decision, like, you know, a big one, about like leaving home or something, it feels sort of… It just doesn't feel real, you know. I don't feel there's a me that I can choose for. And it… Thank you. It wouldn't get me anywhere, you see. It would get you away from your family for a start, wouldn't it? And why is that so important? Well, I mean, there's nothing to keep you there, is there? I mean, you can go, can't you? I mean, if you want to walk out that door, you can, you can walk out. It's just so much easier, though, to do what she wants, you know. What's the meaning of this? Coming home this time in the morning. Waking up the whole neighborhood with that wretched machine. When you've, been out this length of time, you can damn well stop now. Jan. What's up? She won't let me in. Janice. Are you there? Looks like she's gone. It was Friday, wasn't it? No, wait a minute, it was Saturday because I always used to say, well, um, "It's Sunday tomorrow so you can stay out a bit later to­night." "You haven't got to get up in the morning." She was out of work anyway. Well, I had no intention of locking her out. But she didn't have a key. Well, I must admit I wanted to give her a bit of a fright. Shake her up a bit. Because, after all, how did we know where she'd been? Did you ask her? Did I get the chance? Before I could get down stairs, she was away. In a temper, I've no doubt. I tell you what. Your mother wouldn't have stood for it, Vera. Well, we're living in another world. Times have changed. Children are more free today. Um, what's more, they sort of expect it and I suppose, they deserve it. I don't know. This is how the world is today, isn't it? Mum, I'm sorry. Janice is late down this morning. Seems to please herself nowadays, doesn't she? Don't… Stop bloody ignoring me. I'm here right in front of you. Weren't last night, were you? I'm fucking standing here now, aren't I? Hey, hey, hey. You'll just cut that out. If you want anything to eat, get it. Now. And if you don't want it, do without. We've not had a wink of sleep all night, wondering where you were. And look at you. - I begin to wonder whether... - Please, Mum. And don't be just standing there, looking stupid. - …ashamed of yourself. - She locked me out. Who's she? She never locked you out. - She bloody did. - I did not. It must have suited you to go away. I was coming down to open that door and you were away as fast as you could jolly well get. In fact, your father and I have decided you'll have to see a doctor. There's something obviously going wrong with you. What? You cut my baby out. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Put that knife down. If anybody's, killing anybody or upsetting anybody, it's you that's upsetting me. Janice, look nobody's going to touch you, love. I just don't know. Put the knife down. Give it to me. Give me the knife. - She did. - Give me that knife. Put it down. Do as your father tells you. You bloody bitch, you. This is just about the lot. I've had enough of you. Bitch, you're just stupid… - Sit still. - Leave me. It's not a bloody doctor she wants. It's the police, and I'm fed up with the lot of it. You are a wicked girl, Janice. You've done this to our household. You've upset everybody, yourself. You're so wicked. You really are. - I'm not. - You are. No self-respecting person would behave the way you have. Do you know where you've been all night? I don't suppose you do, by the look of you. Do you know where you've been? Who… who were you with? They must have been terrible people. Look at you. You look as if you've been dragged through the gutter. I just don't know what's going to happen, I really don't. You'd better alter your ways and very, very quickly. There must be something wrong with you, child. There must be. I just don't know. Sending me out of my mind, you really are. - Excuse me. - Yes. Good morning. I'm bringing my daughter to Dr. Donaldson's ward. Could you tell me where it is? Yes. If you go down this corridor, turn into the first corridor on the right, right to the very end. - Turn right again… - Not bad in here. - Are we right? - Yes. I'm Mrs. Bailden and this is, uh, Janice. - Morning. - Would you come this way, please? If you just wait there a moment. - Good morning, doctor. - Hello. I'm Mrs. Bailden and this is, uh, Janice, my daughter. - Hello. - Morning. So, have a seat here, shall we? I won't even introduce you to everybody because, uh… Is this the, um, is this the ward? Yeah. I wasn't expecting to see anything just quite like this. It's not, sort of, the usual run of a hospital ward, is it? Hmm. Do you mind that, Janice? - Sorry? - Do you mind us not being like a… usual ward? I don't really care. That's the attitude of the young. - It's the attitude. - Well, I don't really care. Well, you've got to care because... No, it's all right, you know. It, I mean… - It's okay. It's okay. - It doesn't matter. No. - Dr. Gibbs. He's your GP. - Oh. Yes, that's right. Um. He didn't explain this to you? Um, not really, not in detail. You know, I mean, he did more or less give me the details of what was happening, you know. Well, he thought that, uh, this would be the right place for Janice to come to. Um, and we don't, um, give physical treatments here. No pills or… This is what, I mean, this is why it's not like an ordinary hospital. They're not sedated or, you know, tranquilized in any way? Very, very rarely. Hmm. Yes. - What about discipline here? - …look so miserable. What… what about the discipline, doctor? I mean… Well, I mean, do they seem like, uh, an undisciplined lot to you? No, but, um… How do you teach them right from wrong? You know, right from wrong, sort of thing? You know, I mean, people have different standards. Personal standards, about this sort of thing. Hmm. They are, you know, as far as them sleeping, you know what happens about that, I mean... Oh, well, the, the, the… male patients have one dormitory and the female patients - have another dormitory. - Oh, they do, I just wondered you know. Perhaps you'd better meet with… Um, Brent. Could you come and meet Mr. and Mrs. Bailden, they're a bit worried about… - Hello. - How are you? - I'm all right and you? - Doing good. I'm all right. Good, that's fine. How long have you been here? Er, 43 years. Heavens, now that seems a life time. No, no, I've been here about six months. It seems like 43 years, does it? Well, that happens to us all when we're, you know, not doing perhaps the things we want to do. This is Jan and I hope you're going to look after her for me. - Will you? Help to make her better. - Yeah, sure. - Will you help her? - Yes. I'm sure you will. Look a bit cheerful, Jan, for heaven's sake. Perhaps it'll help you too if you get friendly. This'll be nice, won't it? Help each other. That'll be lovely, eh? - I don't really know. - Come on. - Bye-bye, dear. - Bye mum. And do as you're told, won't you? - And be a good girl. - Yeah. And come back nice and well for me. All right? - Cheerio, love. - Goodbye, Dad. Come this way. What's she doing? Sleeping. What do you think about the meaning of the word sin? What do you think it means? Hmm. Well, in my case… In my case, sin is, is just not hurting other people. Like I did before. And, what about when other people hurt you? Well, they don't. They don't? Not… Maybe I've been extra lucky, you know, but… They don't seem to hurt me. Maybe people have been too lenient with me. I don't know, but I don't feel that people have hurt me. Not like I've hurt my parents. Are you sure? Yeah. What about when you, lost your baby? Well, you said something once about, feeling there was somebody else inside you. Yeah, right. - I do. - Is that… Is that the bad one? Hmm. Yes, it's… It's almost like I don't have any sort of control on what I am doing, you know. But just suppose that this bad side is, a part of yourself? Yeah. And… you don't think, do you, that having to keep it down, all the time, could be something to do with, why you feel unreal? Two RAF Canberra bombers collided in mid-air over a golf course near Mansfield in Nottinghamshire today. Their crews bailed out and are in hospital in Mansfield. Oh, shit! Wreckage was scattered over a wide area, but there are no... Hey! Elton John's on. Bugger it. We were watching that. But you said I could watch Elton John. I don't remember that. Hey, bugger this. We were watching that. But it's only the news. …proceed two Anglo-French Puma helicopters… But you said I could watch it, all of you. No, we didn't. We're watching this. - Sit down. - Sit down now. No, you bloody said I could watch Elton John. - Hey, don't touch it. - Here you are. Come on everybody, now you go and sit down. It's not as if I didn't ask. You're all being hypocrites, for god's sake. - Every one of you. - Pipe down and leave it. Trying… I won't put anything on. I'll turn the fucking thing off. Uh! Oh. You said… Hey! Hold it! All right. They told me I could… You're just as bad as my bloody mother! Well, all right, maybe they are, but… You'll pay for it. I did those rude things. That's right. Come and sit down. That's another kiss. Or shall we make it two? There's nothing... Yes, I'll remind you about blackened hook cherry jam from the Hungarian People's Republic. Yes. From… there's a city there, called Budapest. Would you like to come and sit down, David? Want to come sit down? Yes. And they had a little gold coiled serpent of the Pharaohs. What's happened to that project? It was good in 1,500 years… Before this… And the University of Cambridge came in with… And then, what did you do? They, they…When they say… They, they, yeah, they… they think I'm, being bad, and I think I'm being myself. And they say that myself is crazy and, and destructive of myself. Why do you think they say this? Do you think they believe it? Because they don't… Because they don't, they don't, know who I am. The self… The… the me that they say I am destroying, is them. Do you want to destroy them? I want to destroy them in me, yes. I don't want them in me. I really don't want them in me. Yeah, but… she said, her mother's trying to kill her. And I believe her. Well, maybe she's right, yeah. But I just said why. How is she trying to do it? Because it's very wrong. Why don't you tell her to fuck off? Well, my mother's one of these women that… I mean, she's… she's a good woman. She's always been a good woman and she… When things get bad, you know, she… Like I was… not pregnant. I had a baby. And she killed it. If they say that you are bad, the only way to be good is by saying that you're bad, by agreeing that you're bad, so therefore you are good… You are, um, good to be bad. Because at least you are admitting that you are bad. - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. - But if you… if they say that you are bad, and, uh, you… you don't agree that you're bad, then you're bound to be bad, and that's really bad. There's a way of, uh, You can, uh, look at someone and, uh, deny their existence. Just in looking at them. So they say. If you are born with a mother who just doesn't see you, who's got an idea of who you are and doesn't even bother to be curious about what you turn out to be, but knows already who you are. And even if… even if it… You're not the baby, and it's your mother. I mean, it does a little bit, doesn't it? I mean, it doesn't destroy you, but you… you do depend on other people, as, um, reflecting you as alive in the long term. But if somebody could totally ignore me like they totally ignored her when she came home in the morning, I wouldn't… my identity would just shatter. I know, because my mother used to say, "This isn't the real you" if you'd stay out all night, but the real you doesn't stay out all night. But the real me… Just think about this, doctor, really. Um. There seems to be some connection between the whole society of things today. The permissiveness, and the drug taking and, um, just thinking that they can march and demon­strate for the least thing. And it all seems to be tied up somehow. You know, they're… To an end which I just don't know. What end can it be? Where can it lead them? I feel that there must be more control over our younger generation. Because... You feel that control is the answer? - More control? - I think so. One of Janice's feelings is that she is being controlled. I find this very hard to take, you know doctor, because you're saying now, again, that it is the parents… it is my fault. And that I've been the cause of this. It's very hard to take, you know, when you have, in fact, done the best you can for your child. It's very, um, dis­heartening and upsetting and disturbing and, you know, I'm very conscious of this and… Yes, yes, I can see that, but, I mean, after all Janice, uh, in trouble. I mean that in itself is sufficiently upsetting, isn't it? This is terrible. Yes. And, uh, I sometimes lie in bed at night and think, well, one can never get back on this even keel that we were on. Well, is it a matter of getting back? Well, for my part, yes, because we were a happy family. We didn't have all this upheaval. - Yes. But you were all together. - Yes. Jan wants to, separate and go off and live her own life. If this… If this… You feel when she's had this therapy, she can do, she's capable of doing, I will be very willing to let her go and… and see what happens then. - Um, because I do… - Yes, but you've also got to be capable, of accepting it. Because when you separate from your… from your daughter, it isn't just her that's got to be cap­able of doing it, you've got to be capable of doing it too. Certainly, I mean, um, from a good girl behav­ing quite normally, quite happy with the situation in life. Yes, but what do you call "quite happy"? Is it… is… is… Do you really think then she agrees with you? I did feel that there was nothing wrong until... Is it only when she agrees with you that you do feel there's nothing wrong? Yes, but she didn't do the diabolical things that she's doing now. And she is doing diabolical things. Yes, but… perhaps what you call a diabolical thing is simply something that you don't agree with. Such as having abortion? Do you think that's… Would you agree with it if it was your daughter? Was that her decision? What… what else was there for her? What was there? It would've only ruined her life, wouldn't it? And if… I… I'm quite certain of this and everyone around her. Yes, but, uh, that's another point, isn't it? Well, all I can say is whatever I did, I did the best for her. And this is what I felt was the best for her. But, I mean, they can't have it both ways. They can't… Well, nobody can have it both ways, can they? No. They can't take it from you... In some ways, you see, I think that you want it both ways. 'Cause you want her to stand on her own feet. - I do want her… - But you also want her to do what you want. Not so much what I want, but what I feel is good for her. - Because... - That's the same thing, isn't it? Well maybe... Because what you feel is good for her, she may not agree with. She may... Yes, but then I… I realize that she is not yet responsible enough to know, what is good for her. Yeah but, if… When she becomes responsible, then she does know, and I feel that you're rather reluctant, to admit that that might ever be the case. And you think that the behavior that's gone before this last episode, um, is an act of a responsible person? You think... It is the act of a person who is seeking respons­ibility, but is being frustrated in finding it. Oh, well, it's very nice that she can come to this sort of place and that you're going to help me sort this out. - And… - Mmh. And when your feelings are involved as well and your feelings about being at all, not just, you know, whether it's nice or not. Yes. Then in a way, being mad and cutting yourself off from the world, is the only place that you can really be private. Hmm. You mean it's like, it's your, your own little bit of safety? Yeah. So I mean, one of the things is that you can't really stand your parents' disapproval. Actually, it upsets you so much… that you feel you've either got to, do what they say, or else it throws you into, into confusion. And… and you've got to be able to, I mean, we've got to find a way to help you, to both stand up to them… Hmm. and not hate them, for… for disapproving of you either. Yeah. And this takes time. We have a fairly long agenda on… to get through this morning. And as the time is now five past ten, er, let us get on to the first item, which is the question of whether Dr. Donaldson's appointment as registrar shall be renewed or not. Erm. Dr. Carswell, as consultant in Doctor Donaldson's division, perhaps you can... He's done some very interesting work. Experimental and imaginative. And I think that many of us would benefit from his, theoretical conclusions. All the same, I think there is something to be said for, keeping a man like that in circulation. You know? Another hospital and… You do realize this man, has asked to stay on, don't you? Yes, they informed me. The state of Donaldson's actual ward is, uh, not one to which Dr. Carswell is highly sympathetic. For your information, I have taken great and sympathetic interest in Dr. Donaldson, his method and treatment. I have watched his work with the patients in his charge, and if this were a medical convention, I would defend him as a highly original and imaginative psychiatrist. The fact that, in your opinion, shock therapy, drug treatment, and all the rest of it, are highly successful forms of, er, treating his patients, of course had no bearing on the matter. Well, I don't know, but I don't wish to appear heartless, but it does seem to me that there's special pleading going on from the gentleman on my left, as far as Dr. Donaldson's ward is concerned. Now, I hear, in fact, we all administer some 1,500 patients in this hospital. It's a valuable matter, you know. - Not only... - But I'm sorry, as far as this committee meeting is concerned it is an admin­istrative matter. Now if we're to allow some 30 people to be treated in a totally different way from the other, what, 1200 people in this hospital… You see, I do think this is a point. It seems to be, divid­ing the… the… the issue, the fact that this is not, this is not a bureaucratic decision, should a man go at the end of two years. - Could you add anything to this? - What? I said, could you add anything to the discussion? Yes, quite willing to. Oh, good. And as far as I understand Dr. Carswell's point of view, it is in fact that the appointment should not be renewed. That's correct. In that case, Mr. Pullen, would you be kind enough to ask Dr. Donaldson to step into the room? - Certainly, sir. - Thank you. Dr. Donaldson, would you come in, please. Care to take a seat. Good morning, Dr. Donaldson. Good morning. Thank you. I don't think I need to introduce the members of the committee to you. - No. - Good. Erm, Dr. Donald­son, we have received your application for renewal of your appoint­ment and in accordance with our usual custom, we wish you bon voyage and good luck in any other appointment you care to take up else­where. Erm. I thought there was, uh, I thought there was going to be a discussion about this. I'm not worrying. I just want to know where we're going. I'm taking you somewhere where they'll make you better. But where? Oh, don't worry, you spend most of your time worrying. Will you come in now, Jan? Hello, Jan. How are you? Would you like to take your cardigan and your shoes off? Don't want an injection. Don't worry, it won't hurt. Take it off. And your cardigan. And on the bed. - Now, this is... - You won't give me an injection, will you? Don't worry. We do this every day. Just down a little. Lie down. Leg up. Give me your arm. Don't give me an injection. It's just going to be a small prick, and then you'll feel yourself going to sleep. Don't want to go to sleep. Now, just a little prick. Put your head down. Look away. Just a little prick coming now. - Now, there you go, that's it. - Ouch! Ouch! - It's all right, Janice. - Don't want it. There you are, that's all. - Now, here you go. - I don't want… - Count if you like. - I don't want it. One, two, three, four, five. Don't want it. Now, are you feeling tired? Don't want to go to sleep. Now you're going to sleep. Don't want to go to sleep. There you are. There you are. - She's quite relaxed now. - Yeah. All right? Ready? Right. Okay. This is a different type of ward, and it's a different type of treat­ment. Our first objective is to get people in Janice's condition out of hospital and back to normal life. Well, w… w… what were they doing in the other ward then? The other ward has been closed for administrative reasons, Mr. Bailden. In any case, I… I don't think Janice was responding there, but I'm really very optimistic about her chances here. It's nice to hear you say that. I think I can promise you we'll have her back to you very soon. I'm glad to say the, days of long stays in mental hospitals are over. Especially for young people. It's quite unnecessary. Well, excuse me asking… asking you doctor, but, uh, what is the matter with Janice? Well. The indications are that it's a schizophrenic condition. There's many forms and symptoms and I don't want to bother you with all that. The important thing is not to worry. We'll eliminate the symptoms and then, when the time comes, we'll provide her with, any necessary drugs for use at home. Thank you very much, Sister. - Thanks a lot. - Bye-bye. - Bye-bye, Janice. - Come on. - Yes. - But pills and… Well, it's important. Obviously, they are important. What's the matter? What are they whispering for? They're not whispering. Come on. You and I, we'll go on ahead. All right. You'll see. Come on. What's up here… Well, what do you think? Do you like it? Very much, yeah. Well, it's yours. Actually, Tim, I'd… I'd rather not take it home with me. Why not? They could never accept it. Come here. Look at that out there. That's your mum and dad. Get that. Early to bed, early to rise, out to work. That's your mum and dad. Do as they're told. That's what they got to do to you. And that's normal. You see, that's normal. But is it sane? I mean, do you think it's sane? 'Cause I don't. Punctual. Passive in their place. So that they can go out there, out to one of those factories, and do a day's work. That's what it's about. That's what it is and that's what families are. - What? - Like bloody training camps. Aren't they? To get you to do the same thing. Where are you in all this? Eh, I mean, where are you? You see, you can't change it. You can put your mark on it. He looks like he's crying. Aw. Think I'll have a quick leak. I needed that. Oh, look at that. Watch. Watch. Fantastic. Spray it on really thick. On the top. I'm trying. - Tim. - What? You look amazing with blue hair. You bastard. Sorry. You little cow. No! Vera! What the hell do you think you're up to? Have you seen that garden down there? And it's nothing to laugh at. Have you seen the state my gnomes are in? They're like the bleeding seven dwarfs in Technicolor. And don't be laughing at me. It's not a laughing matter. And stop playing with the wallpaper. God knows what you will be playing with next. Your mother can take you to work on Monday. And I'll pick you up. You'll not get out of this bloody house. You stupid bloody bitch. You're raving mad. Now, I hope you're going to enjoy this because I spent a long time preparing it. We'll never eat all that, Mum. We had a big Sunday dinner, you know. We'll never eat it all. Oh well, it is there and… if it wasn't there you couldn't have it, and it is. So if you can't eat it, just leave it, all right? Can I cut your meat for you, love? She can feed herself, you know, Dad. You like Grandad doing this, don't you, eh? All right dear. Got everything? Come on, I want to see it all cleared up, don't forget? - All right. - And you will, won't you? You just prove to Mummy that you can eat it. Because you know you're on my side, aren't you? Mum said you didn't want any, and you do, don't you? Thank you. - How's Derek? - Oh, he's fine. Thought perhaps, we might have seen him this afternoon. Well, he was going to come, but some over­time came up, so he thought he might as well do it. Hmm. Think he ought to try and put himself out a bit, now and again and come down. - Think he'll know his way? - Well. Well, if he doesn't want to come, this is fine. I mean... Well it's not a question of not wanting to, but, I mean, naturally, you know, money does come first, doesn't it? Hmm, with a lot of people, it does. Of course, if you can earn a bit extra money. Unless he wants to borrow something, of course. But, I should say that coming to see your mother and father, um, comes before quite a few things. Well, if he could come, he would. - Oh. That's all right, then. - Want some more, love? As long as I've got your assurance on that, I can feel very much happier. Eat all that up, then we can… I've got a surprise for you then. You'd better eat it up, or your Nana will put it in my sandwiches all week. Won't she? Don't you believe him, that isn't true. Is Jan going to stay up in her room all day then, or what? Well, I hope she'll be down later, but she has taken to staying in her room longer now. Since she's been, um, out at this job, she seems to need the rest. Yes. - After all, you know, she's been very ill. - Oh, I know. She's been a very sick child. I don't know why you're wasting your breath, because Barbara knows. She hasn't been to see Jan, but she knows all about it, and what's good for Jan and every­thing. Probably through her that Jan's in the state she's in. You always resented me for being independent, that's what it was. Me, resented you being independent? Yeah. She should have got out as well. I was worried about the example you were setting your sister, that's what I was worried about. She'd had any sense she'd have got out as well. - So don't you talk about upsets. - She doesn't want to do that. - And, keep that advice to yourself. - She doesn't want to get out. The reason she didn't get out, she's too bloody weak. That's her problem. She respected her parents. And you call that weakness, don't you? Oh, Mum. Can't spend the rest of our lives just trying to please you and him, can we? Look, just because you left home, there's no reason why she should have left home. Bloody pity you won't let her stand on her own feet. - And shut up anyway. - You don't do too badly. And don't be arguing in front of the children. - I'm trying to have my tea. - You're doing all the arguing. So just button it. Jan. How are you, love? - All right? - I'm okay. Have a nice sleep, dear? Yes, thank you. You know, you can always come and live with me. If you feel like a change. - She doesn't want to. - How do you know? Well, ask her then. What do you think, Jan? You don't want someone like me around, Barb. Can't you get it into your head that she's been a very sick girl, and she'd have a fine time, wouldn't she, galivanting around with you all the time? Yeah. Be rotten if she had a good time, wouldn't it? It's a pity you haven't given me a bit more help with her. And come round and seen how she is from time to time, bit more often. Not once did you go and see her in the hospital, and I think that was disgusting. You didn't even let me know how bad she was, did you? Look! Your sister wasn't well. She is your sister and if anyone... As far as you were concerned this was a phase she was going through. I don't call this a phase. Look at her. Just who do you think you're talking to? I'm talking to my mother. Is that all right? - Oh, you do realize it is your mother? - Yes, I do. It's not just some… somebody you've just met in the street? You're only telling her she doesn't know what she is doing. - Look, I'm allowed to give an opinion. - I think she knows what she's doing. That's your own flesh and blood. Look at the state of her. Fancy letting her get like that. Well, I'll tell you what. I'm sorry you're my flesh and blood, because I don't think you are at times, the way you carry on. I'm bloody sorry I'm yours, don't you worry. You've always been a bloody rebel, you have. Don't use that language in front of the children either. If you don't consider them, I do. I wouldn't talk like that in front of them. You've done this to her, you know. - You think so, do you? - Yes. Yes, I do. It's a very terrible thing to say to your mother after I've brought you up. It might be a terrible thing to say, but it's the truth, anyway. Well, all I hope is that it doesn't happen to you. That your children don't turn out... This wouldn't… this wouldn't happen to my children. I don't know how you can go on... So you know better than the doctors now, do you? You know better than them who are trained professionals? Look at her. She's lost about a stone. I wouldn't even have recognized her. She'll lose another bloody stone the way you're carrying on. I'm not going to have these children upset any more. Never mind, dears. Would you like some jelly? Nan's made some nice jellies. - Would you like me to go and get some? - Just pass it off, just like that, yes. Mind your own business, will you? Be quiet for five minutes, or else get out and go. - I've had just about enough of you today. - Yeah. I can't get out quick enough. All right, dears, I'll go and get you a jelly, shall I? Yeah, that's the ans­wer to all, isn't it? Go and get a jelly. And there's no need to be sarcastic about it. None, whatsoever. Haven't you two ever stopped to realize why she's like this? Can't you see why? Because she's sick, isn't she? - You must be too close to it to realize. - I didn't make her sick. - Probably. - I wish she'd come home with me. - That's why they've sent her out. - I'd make her a bit happier than that. Because they know what a good mother and father she's got. You must be joking. Oh, you're a cheeky bloody bitch, you are. Words just fail me with you. Yeah, 'cause you don't like the truth, do you? It bloody hurts, doesn't it? Oh, shut up, for Christ's sake. And don't tell me to shut up. You're not talking to Jan now, you know. What are you going to do about this anyway? - What am I going to do about it? - Yes. You. Well, I'm not going to tell you to begin with, because it's none of your business what I do about it. What have you done since you've left here? Ten years moving from one flat to another. You must have moved three times. Well, at least we've improved ourselves, haven't we? - I'll tell you what, if this… - It's regular. If this husband of yours turns out half as good as me, he'll be a good 'un. - Take my word for it. - Martin's twice the man you are, let me tell you. He's what? - He's bloody well twice the man you are. - He's what? Are you trying to tell me that I'm not a man? Is this what… is this what you're telling me? You're not quite such a big man as you like to think you are. I don't think I'm a big man, but I'm a responsible man. A normal man. I brought the family up in a normal way. - Now I'm beginning to wonder. - Do you think so? I'm beginning to wonder. You're not such a marvelous family, are you? I couldn't wait to get out and look at the state she's ended up in. Shut up. Throw that bloody jelly over her head, if I was there. Now, we're not going to take any notice of your mother, and Grandpop making all this noise. We're going to have the jelly now. Do you want some? That's right, let's all have the jelly. Come on. Barbara if you don't stop it, you'll have to leave this house now. I mean it. I'm leaving it, don't worry. When I've finished saying what I've got to say, I shall go. You have yours, love. There you are, dear. I think it's disgusting behavior in front of your own dear children. I don't know how you can do it. Doesn't it ever occur to you why she's in this state? Don't you ever think you could be wrong? Well, you're never wrong, are you? Well, I'm not wrong about this. I know why she's like this. Well, before you come round criticizing your mother, now have a look at your own two children. They're terrified through you… - Terrified? - Raising your bloody voice. There's nothing wrong with my children, thank you. - They're quite all right. - That's what you think. Stop it. I've had just about enough of it. I'm not going to stop it and let you shout at me, don't you worry. And don't shout at me because I shall set about you, as old as you are. And don't you forget it, my girl. The trouble is they didn't have bloody belts when they were little. …or else out you go. Now listen, I've got something to tell you, my girl. I'm going to mark your card right now for you. Do you think we've spent a lifetime, building a house like this, to be spoken to like this? Or hasn't it ever entered your bloody head? This is a lifetime's work when you've got children. - Yeah, I know that. - You wouldn't realize this. …thrust down our throat every five minutes, do we? I haven't made her like this. This is what you've done over years, not what I've done in one afternoon. - You reckon do you? - Yes. I bloody well do. The best thing… the best thing you can do is to shut up. Stop! Jan. Jan. Jan, I've got a spare room. Come and stay with me, please. Will you, please? Get away from them. Jan, please, will you? Come on, come with me. Barbara, just go. Just go. Just leave me. I… I… I want to get you out of my sight for a little while. I shall go, but I'm going to come back. I'm not going to let her to stay in this dump. - Go. This minute. Leave us. - Get away from... Go on, get out of it, you… Go on! Give her her bloody bag or whatever she's left behind then. That's it. Don't bother to do it up. Right. Come on. Fine thing when your children have to leave the house like this. Give us a kiss before you go, dear. Bye-bye, darling. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. We heard this clatter, in the middle of the night. And we didn't know what the hell it was, and when we went down, we found Janice, and she'd broken my clock. And it wasn't just an ordinary clock. I'd done 25 years' loyal service for this clock. And Mr. Prendergast presented it to me personally. Never mind, dear. She'll have to replace it. - You can't replace it. - When she gets work again. It doesn't matter how long it takes her to save up. She'll have to replace it. Well, Janice? Time. Time? It was killing time. Killing time? You should be doing bloody time. But you'd found work, hadn't you? You were… Was the job all right? Would you like it? Well, I tell you this. This is her lot. She can't go anywhere… Well, she just can't go anywhere on her own, can she? What made you do it, Janice, when we thought you were out of this, and it was all over for good? I might just as well come back in here, mightn't I, doctor? Why do you say that? If I don't love them, got to go somewhere. I think perhaps we might have a word outside. Now there's nothing to worry about. But, probably we ought to… Ah, Dr. Garfield. Hello, Jan. How do you feel about coming back to us for a little while then? Hate you all. Did something wrong. Must've done something. You know what she's doing, don't you? - Put that down for a minute and listen. - I'm trying to read. Yeah. She's going out with men. What's more, she's letting them interfere with her. I'm not. I'm bloody not. - And don't get swearing at me neither. - And what do I do? You're turning into a loose girl and you look it too. You look as if you're turning into a loose girl. You're doing what… I know what you get up to these days. I know what you all get up to. But don't get coming to me when you've got trouble. - Because I don't want to know. - Is sex wrong, or some­thing? Sex isn't wrong. No. Sex isn't wrong at all. It's very beautiful. In its right place. And where's that then? In marriage. 'Course that's something you don't want to know anything about either, is it? How do you know what I do? You're my daughter, how… how… Why should I worry about what happens to you? Sex. Sex. Sex. All the time. You can't think I go out and do anything else. Dirty Sunday papers. You're disgusting, the pair of you. I hope you never regret those words. I tell you what I shall do. I'll go out and pick up a man this minute, a tramp, anybody, a man on the street, and I'll let him have me. Cheeky little bloody cow, you are. You bloody bitch. Don't you dare talk like that in this bloody house again. Dirty little whore, that's what you are. What I think you need is rest and quiet. Plenty of that, hmm? And Dr. Garfield will come and see you in the ward tomorrow. I've had hundreds of men, you know. Sh… she's a whore. You want to watch her. You… you want to stop her. I think you can see inside me, in there. See what she's doing. You can have me if you want to. It doesn't really matter. Can't have me if I don't exist, can you? Not… not me. 'Cause if you do away with her that leaves me, doesn't it? That's if you want me to exist. Yes, of course we want you to exist, Jan. I don't know what it feels like. Why, it's finding a place in the world. In society. You know, making relationships. Getting married. Having a family. I'm mad then? Well, you are ill. Hello. Hello. Just brushing up here. Here you are. Would you like a cigarette? Will you do me a favor? Get that shovel a minute. Here you are. I'll just push these leave onto it. You know, just dump them in there. Here we go. All right. Are you in here then? Yeah. Came of my own accord, though. They brought me in here. I've had that electric shock treatment. - So have I. - But you don't feel anything, do you? Not a drop. Luck. You don't feel anything. Feel a bit dazed? Makes the old memory go off a bit. Watch your feet. If we're in here. They know what they're doing. That's the main thing. Always remember, must have discipline. Must discipline yourself, not abuse yourself. Look at me. I'm better now. I'm off out soon. But the other thing I like, is you don't get treated like a child. Get treated like an adult. If you start roughing things up, away go the old privileges. I've seen it in the Army. Soldiers get bolshie, and bolshie they are. And where does it end up? In the glasshouse. None of that nonsense here, you know. They give you a chance, and you can make a go of it. Have you nearly finished your brushing up? Yes, nearly. Shall we go for a bit of a walk? Go for a walk? Yes. Nothing wrong with that. Makes them a bit nervous. Who? The staff. They don't like it. Whatever for? It's just a bit dodgy, that's all. Supposing that you and me were attracted, or anybody else, in the hospital were attracted to one another and we, you know. I mean, it'd be us, wouldn't it? Yeah, but you're a sick person, aren't you? Oh. While you're here you're under their charge. You've got to look at it their way. You can't go on like you do outside. I don't go on when I'm outside. Come off it. I can see you do. What? You've had more pricks in you than a second­hand dartboard. See, you're laughing at it now. I know. - That's just your opinion. - Am I right? No. There's nothing wrong in asking you to go for a walk. I'm not promiscuous. Tomorrow afternoon. - Same time. - All right. But, um, it doesn't do to be, uh, telling everybody. Keep it quiet. And we'll go for a walk. All right. I won't tell anybody. Well done. We'll go for a walk. Right. - Ta-ta. - Great. Jan. Er, I'd like a little word in the office. What about? Oh, just, see how things are. - And that is, hmm? - Come on. What's it about, Sister? It's about Paul Morris. He's going out soon. - Yes, I know. He told me. - Ah. Quite a little friendship you've struck up there. No, not really. Oh, good. 'Cause, it's… it's not really quite the thing, Jan, is it? Isn't it? Ah, you know it's not. You sound like my mother. That's nothing to be ashamed of. Sit down. You see, Jan. We don't want you to be taken advantage of. I know what I'm doing. I didn't say you didn't. Look, have I been mis­behaving or something? Oh, no. Just a little, self-willed. A little, uh, thoughtless. That's all. Oh, I see. You see Jan, in hospital, it isn't quite the thing, I mean, you and Paul. I've heard, I don't suppose it's anything serious, but I have heard that, um, after one of your little walks together, he isn't, um, quite as well. - Do you know what I mean, Jan? - No. When you go for your little walks I want you to remember this. Think about what I've said. What are you saying? Well. The fact is that all sorts of friendships, they grow. You know that, Jan. They grow into deeper waters, things that you can't get out of so easily. And you might find your­self up to your neck in it. I don't think I've ever known. That's fine. I knew you would be sensible, Jan. You're a bright girl. Well. I'm glad we had this little chat. It's cleared the air. Oh. Stop that! Don't, Janice. Don't, Janice. Janice, you'll be all right. Hold. We've got you. Come on. Just sit. Just sit. Sit down with me. No. I don't want it. - No. No. - Open your mouth. Open your mouth, Jan. It's good for you, Janice. Oops. Have some water. There you are. - Just a little water. - No. There you are, that's it. It's all right. Okay. - You'll be all right, darling. - Oh. - Lie down. - I didn't want it. Come on, Nurse. Thank you. Oh. It hurts. It will go. It will be all right. I can't see anything. I can only hear your voice. I'm next to you, love, don't worry. You're safe now. They're pulling at me again. - Bloody wires. - Try and relax, Janice. Try and relax, love. They've got those wires attached to my head again, going into me. - Right inside me, into my brain. - No wires. There are no wires. This great big machine. What machine, Janice? Great big machine in the center of the world that controls us all. Controls Sister, and you, and me. - There's no machine here. Don't be silly. - I can hear it throbbing and… Now don't be silly, you are quite safe. Controlling us all. Controlling you and sister and me. Now don't be frightened, love. Don't be fright­ened. - Can you see the walls throbbing? - There's no machine. There's no machine around. It's throbbing, I'm throbbing. Look here, don't be silly. There's no machine around. You mustn't… - You mustn't be silly. - It's gonna kill me. Nothing's going to kill you. Nothing. Nothing's going to happen to you. You mustn't be silly. We won't let anybody come to you. - I'm so scared. - We won't let anybody hurt you. Nobody. Come. Just relax. Just relax. That's it. That's it. You go to sleep. Try, try and relax, Janice. That's it, love. Just ready for this. Thank you very much, Nurse. That all right? I really don't know what to think about all this, Janice. Really, I don't. It's getting on top of me. Look. That nurse that was upset, she was entitled to be upset. I mean, after all these years now, are you beginning to realize who's been right? Us or do you still think you're right? I don't know. You don't know. She doesn't know. You only attacked the staff nurse with a chair, that's all, and you say you don't know. Then there's this boy. What's going on there? We're very concerned and worried about him. I didn't do anything with that boy. It was nothing? Yet it ended up with you going wild. - I didn't go wild. - What was it then? I mean, when we came in here today, I… I couldn't look that nurse straight in the face. Don't look so miserable. We're not really getting at you. Cheer up. Look, love. Try and behave your­self, for god's sake, will you? I mean, you have to collaborate with them. Because if you don't, you could be in here forever. I know. Sometimes I think it's if I do cooperate that's how I'll be in here forever. Good afternoon. Can I help you? Uh, I want to see Janice Bailden. She's in this ward in here. Yes, she… she's with her parents now. Shall I give her a message? Oh, no, that's all right. I'll wait, thanks. Thank you. Look, I'll put it this way to you. It's like falling and breaking your leg, or having a broken arm. There's nothing to be ashamed of. I'm not ashamed. This is just it. You're not ashamed. Even this would be understandable, but you're not. You're a law unto your­self, aren't you? You don't have to be ashamed. You'd laugh the other side of your face if you knew how you had upset us these last few years. It's not a bit funny, I can tell you. To think that we have to come to visiting you in a place like this. And another thing. It all comes out of public money, it's all free here for you. And I think the least you can do is to show just a little appreciation. Do you realize that we come here twice a week to see you? We've never missed since you've been here. We don't have to come. We come here because we love you. You think you are doing everybody a big favor, um, just being in their presence. When, in fact, if you really knew the truth, my dear, it's far from that. Far from that. - You don't... - Mrs. Bailden. - You don't have... - Is every­thing all right? - Well, you know we… - Yes, fine. Thank you, nurse. It's a bit difficult sometimes, but… Well, she's looking much better, isn't she? Yes, she is. I… Yes. I suppose she is. Yes. I will take your cup and perhaps I will see you later, yes? Yes, I'd like to do that. - Good. - Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you for looking after her. Oh, you are welcome. - Don't be so rude. - Damn bloody stupid. It's not funny, not a bit funny. Are you listening to us? Where are you going now? - I'm going for a wee. - Going for a walk? Where to? A wee. A widdle. A piddle. That's charming. Jan. Jan. Oh, Tim. Hey. What are you doing here? - I came to see you. - Here in the hospital. Tell lies about you. What are you talking about? You don't know what they do. They say things behind your back. Who do? Sister'd keep you here forever. - What are you talking about, Jan? - Don't you understand this? It's no use. - Calm down... - You'll be here forever. Where's your coat? Eh? - Come on. - My coat's in the bedroom. Where's your bedroom? It's in there. - Right, go on. Go and get it. Go on. - If I listen… You're not stopping here. You're not stopping here. Come on, get your coat. Jan. Come on. But all this time that's going past, this is what I'm concerned with. Can't you do… send out and find her? Well, you know she's a voluntary patient here, don't you? Yes, I know she's a voluntary patient, but surely somebody must be responsible. I mean, voluntary is one thing, but you can't send a person in, like… in the state Janice was in. Mrs. Bailden, to bring her in against her wishes, is a very, very serious step. I must, in fact, be convinced either that she will do harm to herself or another, or B, that she is incapable of looking after herself now. I can assure you she's that. She's just that, she's not capable. I ought to know. I've been through years of this now, and it's been absolutely impossible. Now this. Yes, there is a… a procedure under section 29. The general practitioner signs the application. The general practitioner! You, a consultant at a hospital beholding to a general practitioner. I'm washing my hands of this. You're the one responsible. - I'm the only... - Quite right as well. I'm the only medical person here... Well, I'm afraid you'll have to be the only one to do it as well then. Just… It'd be as easy as that. Because I'm holding you personally responsible for my daughter. Because I brought her here in good faith and I thought that she would be under some control, but obviously she hasn't been. You know, if I have to go back into hospital then I won't… There'd be no more coming out. Won't there? Why not? Well, for one thing, people know what you are there, don't they? They get on with looking after you, and you get on with feeling the pain. What sort of pain can you feel when you're on tran… tranquillizers, Jan? It's a long way away. It's very far away. But at least I don't feel unreal. I don't feel anything. Nothing. Mr. Foster? What do you want? I think you have Miss Janice Bailden here. Yes, that's right. Eh, may we come in? - Is that your room at the end there? - Yeah. Wait here. I think… We'll just look in, if you don't mind? - Is Janice in here? - Er, yes. She's asleep. Now look, young man, I'm a doctor. She's a sick girl. A very sick girl. I know I can help her. Now, do you mind getting out of my way? Look, I live here you know. Yes, I know, young man. She's in need of my help. - Oh, yeah. - Where's the switch? Now just let me pass, young man, and I'll see to her. No need to worry. If you'd just… just let the doctor look at her. Janice. Janice. Wake up, Janice, girl. Now, do you recognize me, Janice? Janice, I'm the doctor from the hospital. You've seen me many times. Don't you think she'd be far better off in hospital, rather than down here on the floor? No, I don't actually. - You don't? - No. You just stay there, and I'll get the ambulance men. And we'll be off in a few moments. Nothing to worry about. Well, she'll… obviously, she'll have to come back in. - Yes. - In no state to be left here. If you go and get the men… - All right, doctor. - Thank you. The girl's in the corner. Now come along, Janice, everything's all right now. - You'll be all right. - Your coat. You haven't got any right to do this. Look, lad, she either comes of her own free will, or we put her on a section. If we do that she becomes a compulsory patient. Oh, fuck off. Look, if… if she's a compulsory patient, you'll be in trouble with the police, I'm telling you. - So you might as well... - Get off! Now come on, lad. Come on. Get off! Behave yourself. Come on. - Behave yourself. - Get back! - Look after the girl. - Bastards. - Behave yourself. Get hold of his arms. - Back off. Get off. Leave. Stop it, or we'll have to have the police in here. Well, turn it in. Just look after the girl. I'll look after him. Come on love, you'll be all right. Get off. - I'll cover her legs up. - Okay. Keep your eye on him. Here. These are hers. Uh, thank you. Now. In order to ill­ustrate some of the things we've been talking about, I have brought along a, a young girl. In many ways, a very, typical case history. From a reasonably happy background. Comfortable home. Happy childhood. No sign of any sort of disturbance until her late teens. Then, in and out of various jobs for a while. Her case notes here include, thought­ blocking, over inclusion, emotional apathy, automatic obedience. And as far as we know, there's no discernible connection between her various symptoms, and her environment. Now, I'll have her in. Staff Nurse, would you bring her in. Come on, Janice. Sit down. That's it. Good morning, Janice. How are you this morning? You'll notice she doesn't reply. This is a, good example of extreme mutism. I think the clinical picture is a fairly clear one. And the, uh, present condition of the patient, what you might call a, logical expectation, given the case history. Now. Any questions?
