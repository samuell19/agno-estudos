Don't move! Or I'll-- You'll what? Shoot me? Twenty rounds a second, and you were still too slow. I'm not slow, punk. -Me neither. -I've got him. Robin! I had to take him down. You shattered his collarbone! He's a drug dealing pimp. I didn't think I had to prop up some pillows before I took him out. We needed him. He would've talked, but you put him into shock. Sorry. That was dumb. But he deserved it. That movie was amazing! Hey, Dad, imagine if Zorro came riding through Gotham on his horse right now! Well Bruce, I'm not so sure a masked vigilante would be welcomed in Gotham City. Sadly, they'd probably just lock someone like Zorro in Arkham. Those were his last words to me. Lately I've been wondering... if he was right. I had years and you, Alfred, to help me come to terms with the murder of my parents. But I must have been crazy to put Jason in the field before he'd recovered from his loss. His father murdered by Two-Face, his mother succumbing to illness. His actions as Robin are guided by unresolved pain and anger. He's a danger to himself. A danger to our mission. I have no choice. Jason's going off active duty immediately. Fine with me. Jason. Jason? Wow. That looked like it really hurt. Whoa. Now hang on. That looked like it hurt a lot more. So let's try and clear this up, okay, pumpkin? What hurts more? A... Or B? Forehand... Or backhand? A little louder, lamb chop. I think you may have a collapsed lung. That always impedes the oratory. Now that was rude. The first Boy Blunder had some manners. I suppose I'm going to have to teach you a lesson, So you can better follow in his footsteps. Nah. I'm just going to keep beating you with this crowbar. -Jason. -Bruce? What are you doing here? You followed me. Figures. I was about to guess the same of you. But I didn't follow you to Bosnia, I followed Ra's al Ghul. He's got you jumping through hoops to marry his daughter again, huh? Well, I'm on my own mission here. -I'm tracking Joker. -Joker? Here? And you're tracking him alone? You know how dangerous-- I know that he shot Barbara through the spine! And I know he didn't stop there. But you only put that waste of life back in a cell. Well, he's broken out. Again. And someone had to do something-- Jason, Ra's is attempting to build dirty bombs that could kill thousands with radiation poisoning. He's here in Bosnia, buying nuclear material from an unknown seller. Joker got a hold of stolen uranium. I got a lead he's selling it to terrorists. Excellent detective work, son. I think it's going to take Batman and Robin together to close this case. Ra's' men are trying to get the uranium across the border. We'll lose them if we don't act now. Batcycle only seats one. You take them down while I investigate that warehouse we tracked Joker to. No. Stay here. Just watch that warehouse until I return. -But-- -Jason for once, please listen to me. Don't go after Joker alone. He's just too dangerous. You read me? Loud and clear. Just hurry back. Okay, kiddo, I gotta go. It's been fun though, right? Well, maybe a smidge more fun for me than you. I'm just guessing since you're being awful quiet. Anyway, be a good boy, finish your homework, and be in bed by 9:00. And hey, please tell the big man I said... "Hello." No! He's alive. He's alive. You're going to be all right, son. I'm going to get you all fixed up. Fixed up... but different. Stitches, skin grafts, scar tissue. Seventy-two days bedridden. The outside is healing, but the inside... It's like suddenly I can see through walls, through lies, like the smiles they use to hide their pity and fear. They see me as a victim, a failure, a thing that could happen to them. And they're right. The truth hurts more than the 27 shattered bones Joker gave me. But what I see is that they're the victims, victims of Bruce Wayne. Dick, adopted co-dependent of his mommy-daddy issues. Barbara, crippled by a maniac of his creation. What kind of damaged individual mentors a child into the line of fire to begin with? The butler did it. I was doing fine before Bruce brought me into his family. I was alone before this family. I was alive before I let this insanely messed up family lead me to slaughter! Never again. No more family. I, alone, will become more than the dreams and nightmares they imagined for me. New details are emerging tonight from a grisly murder scene in downtown Gotham City. Several notorious crime lords were gunned down in cold blood. A witness in the area reported seeing a masked gunman with the letter "R" on his chest. You know what scares a criminal? It ain't a guy dressed like a bat. The question under investigation tonight, did Batman's former protege, Robin, strike again? Moments after the Dark Knight apprehended Barbara Ann Minerva aka Cheetah, she was shot and killed by a yet-to-be-identified sniper. Batman unchained from his self-imposed, moral leash. That scares criminals. Scares Bruce even more. The GCPD has condemned Robin's murderous rampage, but some in the public actually applaud the execution of criminals. The fear Bruce will never face is the truth Gotham needs most. I've become his fear, thanks to the Joker. Can't wait to return the favor to them both. The infamous crime lord known as the Black Mask was barbecued by the Boy Wonder man killer. Vigilante Robin continues cleaning the streets of Gotham with blood. Crime rates plummet thanks to Robin, but at what cost? Even the Batman can't seem to stop Robin's rampage. It is impressive that you have evaded the Batman this long. But no one can evade the League. That remains to be seen. When you're trained by the ol' bat, you learn a thing or two. Or three. Like how to cover your six with hidden explosives? Please. I'm a commander in the League of Assassins, and the daughter of Ra's al Ghul. I know exactly who your family is, Talia. In fact, I found a special file on the bat computer all about you. Read like a cheap romance novel. I'll take that as proof my beloved still cares. But I will wager that his files do not include this small detail. Oh, shh. Hush now, Damian. Do you recognize your brother? Damian has your father's eyes, don't you think? Your adoptive father, that is. - His files said-- -That I lost our child before birth. A lie I told Bruce so he would not have to choose between our two families. So that he would return to you, Jason. After he nearly lost you to my father's dealings in Bosnia, Bruce made it clear that our ties were broken. Forever. Clearly, in the aftermath of Bosnia, you and Damian both lost a father figure. Trust me, you dodged a bullet losing Bat-Dad. The son of Batman needs a father figure. Who better to help raise him than his brother? Whoa, lady. Look, I-- -You need a family, Jason... -Nope. Never again. The house of al Ghul's interests run parallel to your own. Let's agree to disagree. We can use the League's resources to find the Joker. Joker crossed a line with Barbara, with you, with my father. And Batman will never do what must be done for those transgressions. We will. Talia said what she knew I needed to hear. I'll take any path to Joker I can get. But the truth is she had me at Damian. The son Bat-Dad ran off and spawned while I was home alone. Yeah, that stung a little. So the chance to twist that kid against Bruce and his mother... ...to use him to burn down the house of Wayne and al Ghul from the inside... I guess I'm destined for family life after all. Oh, Damian, my brother. You're gonna be all right. I'm going to get you all fixed up. Robin! I'm sorry. Hold on. Batman? Batman! Batman! Bruce! - Jason. - Bruce! I'm so sorry! Don't... Don't try to talk. Look, I can call for help. Jason... No time for that... Listen. Promise me you won't kill Joker... for killing me. Protecting Gotham, helping others healed me. I want that for you, because I love you, son. I know the anger, the pain you have inside. Killing him won't end that pain. You have to be strong. Use this pain to be strong, son. For your family, Barbara and Dick. For Joker. - Bruce... - Promise you'll be strong. I... I... No. Jason. We save lives every day. Strangers'. And there's always enough time. But for Jason... Thank you. But you already know how I failed to save Jason from this life. What you don't know is how I failed to save him from the next. In the five years following Jason's death, I redoubled my efforts to protect Gotham City... alone. To avoid endangering anyone else. As always, Nightwing had other ideas. The years Dick spent at my side as the first Robin taught him... a little too much. Now he has the annoying habit of showing up at the exact moment I need an extra hand. Or fist. Of course, I could never admit that to him. It would only encourage him. But I appreciate his loyalty. His sense of family. It seems fitting that Nightwing was there the night it all began. I was tracking an arms shipment for the crime lord called Black Mask. Hijackers intercepted his shipment. We persuaded the driver lo confess he worked for a rival of Black Mask's called "The Red Hood." A sniper ended the interrogation. Could've ended us. But he laid out the red carpet to follow him instead. A trap. So I followed him, leaving Nightwing behind, and safe. The sniper made pursuit easy, but never allowed me close enough to ID him. Then, he led me to the factory. - That place, where the Red Hood died... - God, please, no! Stay away! It's a set up! Where the Joker was born. My first great failure. The sniper, a new Red Hood, seemed to know all of it. He was sending me a message. And it echoed Bosnia. I cleared my mind by focusing on the facts. The Amazo heist and reports from Nightwing showed that Red Hood was taking over the crime syndicates of Gotham with deadly force. Some of Gotham's most wanted, slaughtered. I had to protect the rest. Had to stop this Red Hood. The first person to question was the last person I ever want to see. I needed Nightwing to accompany me to Arkham Asylum. To divide Joker's attention. Get him to reveal a connection to the Red Hood. And help contain... Well... The effort proved useless. With no accomplice or base of operations to investigate, we turned to Red Hood's known target, Black Mask. We staked out his latest drop of trafficked weapons hoping for interference. We weren't disappointed. The Red Hood's ability to evade us was irritating, but educational. Advanced parkour, counter-attacking on the run... and the skill to escape my grapnel lines. Nobody cuts my grapnel lines. Frustration made me stupid and careless. I dropped right into another trap. Another inferno... ...another escape. Because of my choice, my mistake, Dick was injured. I couldn't even look him in the eye. Going forward, I had to work alone. I needed to finish this alone. To avoid repeating mistakes. And because this was getting personal. Knowledge of my tactics, my history, escaping with those damned explosions, and evidence that he even knew my name. It all pointed to an impossible conclusion. But if I've learned anything over the years, it's that the impossible is just the unthinkable lying in wait. I needed to find him again, but I wasn't the only one hunting the Red Hood. To flush him out, Black Mask declared all-out war against Red Hood's organizations. Gotham City was caught in the crossfire. When I finally caught up to him, he was barely surviving an ambush... ...outnumbered four-to-one, by high-tech assassins. I balanced the scales. To protect them, and to test him. His maneuvers, his timing, our coordination, as familiar as Jason's when he fought at my side as Robin. No! But then, he crossed the line. Just to make a damn point. He was cleaning up Gotham by controlling it with deadly force, because my way didn't work. A familiar argument. That was the moment I knew. Jason, the son I had lost, had returned. He'd been... resurrected. The body I brought home from Bosnia five years ago... was a fake. How could I not have looked inside his coffin before we buried it? Stupid and careless. Following his death, I had allowed myself a moment of weakness. I allowed myself to be deceived. There was only one other person in Bosnia who could have pulled this off. Ra's al Ghul. Ra's is a formidable enemy, but an honorable one. He'd even tried to get me to marry his daughter, Talia. There was once a twisted sense of family between us. But that was before Bosnia... ...before his deal with the Joker. Bombing the banks of Europe with Joker's stolen uranium was only one part of their bargain. Distracting me from their deal was another. I thought killing Robin was the third part. I was wrong. Ra's had no idea Robin was in Bosnia. Robin's intel and backup tipped the balance of the mission in our favor, and teaming up afforded us the chance to relieve a growing disconnect between us. Then it happened. It was uncharacteristic humility for Ra's to admit that he underestimated Joker. His body language, his micro expressions, the fact that he, too, is a father, it was clear that Ra's was deeply grieved by Jason's passing. As was I Desperate to rectify his disservice to me, he found a way to steal Jason's body for submersion in his Lazarus Pit. As it had helped him cheat death, Ra's used its supernatural properties to resurrect my son. But the cost was high. While the Pit revivifies the body, its effects on the mind are less predictable. The process drove Jason mad. He escaped the house of al Ghul despite Ra's' efforts to contain him. The Lazarus Pit was obvious, I was prepared for that part of the story. It was only after hearing the rest of it, that Jason had been lost to both of us for five years, did I realize the true reason I confronted him. I wanted Ra's to be responsible for the Red Hood. I wanted to blame someone else for what Jason had become. But I, alone, was responsible for Jason's path. The Red Hood was a nightmare of my own making. I had to get back to Gotham to stop him. The war in Gotham had escalated. Red Hood took the battle directly to Black Mask. And Black Mask, never one to get his own hands dirty, broke the Joker out of Arkham to hire him to kill the Red Hood. Clearly, he hadn't heard that hiring the Joker doesn't work out well. Black Mask quickly found himself hoisted with his own petard, tied up in the back of a trailer, and soaked in gasoline. Sure enough, Joker got Red Hood's attention. But getting Joker out of Arkham was Jason's goal all along. Black Mask was just the pawn to make it happen. Jason was playing a long game of revenge against the entire criminal underworld, against Joker... against me. All building to a final confrontation. He captured Joker, and summoned me to meet them. I knew I couldn't be late. Never missing a chance to gain a psychological advantage, Jason chose Crime Alley as our meeting place, where I lost my father and mother to a murderer. Where I gained a son. Jason wanted it all to end that night, but I was going to save my son, or die trying. We could've fought all night. But no blow would land as hard as the one I felt when he finally removed the helmet. For that moment, I was just a father again. I didn't want to fight anymore. I begged him to stop, to let me help. But he wasn't done. So neither was I. It was always a contest with Jason, him against the world. Even dying didn't teach him he was wrong. There was no more reasoning, no more holding back. He wanted pain, I was ready to unleash it. Ready to drag that kid through fire, through hell and back, to show him once and for all his contest wasn't with the world, it was with himself. And then, he finally got the moment he'd been planning for five years. Jason said he'd forgiven me for not saving him that night in Bosnia. But that I didn't avenge his death afterward, that I didn't kill Joker for killing him, was a betrayal he could not live with. So he crafted his final challenge for me. He wanted to look me in the eye while forcing me to make a choice between our ideals. Kill Joker or kill Jason to stop him from killing Joker. But life isn't a game, and death is never a choice. To make it so is our undoing, it would be my undoing. I think about killing Joker every day, ending the monster that I let loose on the world. But I'll never allow myself that release, a promise I made to my father and mother, an example to a son that I will never stop fighting to protect from himself. No! Don't spoil it! This is better! I'm the only one who's gonna get what he wants tonight! Yes! Bing, bang, boom! We all go out together! Don't you just love a happy ending? / can never stop fighting to protect them from themselves. To protect them from me. We only come to know the true power of evil when we work to suppress it in ourselves. You know, when you say spooky stuff like that, you justify my contingency plans to defeat you. What I'm saying, Bruce, is that you are the strongest person I know. Not because of the monsters you fight on the outside, but for the demons you battle on the inside. Your willingness to open up to me about this... Well, that shows real strength. And the day you stop reaching out for this support is the day I know I need to activate my contingency plan for you. We'll find Jason. Together. Right after I find the check. Thank you, Clark. And I paid the tab before you arrived. But how did-- You order the same thing every time. Even over dessert you have to be two moves ahead? Really? We buried him next to Thomas and Martha, the Wayne family. Finally reunited. Finally at peace. After the funeral, I went straight to the cave. I told Dick and Barbara I had to work through our loss by getting back to the mission, as Batman would've wanted. I promised to Alfred the Bat family would capture Joker together, as Bruce would've wanted. I lied. So, I alone could find him. And send him off to hell. Weirdly, Big Blue paid a visit lo console me with stories about the world's finest detective and friend. Nice. I almost went for Batman's Kryptonite stash. Then, Wonder Woman. We shared Bat war stories, and she left feeling I was on a healing path. Glad she didn't use her Lasso of Truth on me. Big brother Dick dropped by again. More Bat stories. Flash apparently got the Justice League memo to pep-talk Robin. More Bat stories. And holy Batcrap! Dick again. Day in and day out, more heroes followed. All of them sharing their stories. Batman was scary, but smart. Brutal, but just. Cold, but caring. The Dark Knight was always there for anyone facing their darkest day. It struck me that all these superpowered heroes had so much to unload about a guy with no powers to me, another guy with no powers. Like I'm their super friend or something. I think Bruce would have liked that. GCPD's Commissioner, Jim Gordon, credits the Batman with exposing a meta-human trafficking network allegedly tied to Stagg Industries. Tune in tonight at 11:00 for more updates on Gotham's caped crusader. If you'd fought alongside him, you'd know that's not Batman. It's probably Nightwing filling in for Bats. And you, uh, just happen to know Batman, huh? Mmm. Knew him. He's gone now. The old Boy Wonder knows to keep the Bat legend flying. Or else Gotham would explode with crime. Interesting theory. You said you fought alongside him? Oh, I'm a new man now. Got a new life. Starting over fresh. At least that's what I write in my journal. My therapist says that'll help. Eventually. Talking things out helps too, friend. As it turns out, I happen to be a good listener. Yeah, sure thing. You know, this reminds me of a joke I told Bats once. You wanna hear it? See, there were these two guys in the lunatic asylum, and one night, they decide they don't like living in an asylum anymore. They decide they're going to escape. So, like, they get up onto the roof, and there, just across this narrow gap, they see the rooftops of the town, stretching away in the moonlight, stretching away to freedom. Now, the first guy, he jumps right across with no problem. But, his friend didn't dare make the leap. You see... You see, he's afraid of falling. So then, the first guy has an idea. He says, "Hey! I have my flashlight with me. I'll shine it across the gap between the buildings. You can walk along the beam and join me." But the second guy just shakes his head. He says, "What do you think I am? Crazy? You'd turn it off when I was halfway across." Meh! Crickets! It's just not the same joke without Batman here. Well, next time I see him, I'll tell the big man you said hello. Boy Wonder. Get on the ground! -Face down. Do it now! -Hands behind your head. Don't do anything stupid. You're under arrest! We buried him next to Thomas and Martha. The Wayne family finally reunited. Finally at peace. For me, there's a war inside my head, inside my heart. On one side, murderous rage. The other, my promise to Bruce. As he fought down his anger for the mission, I will do the same. I refused visitors. Refused their condolences. I needed the pain to stay sharp, to stay strong. To focus on a plan. Kill Joker. To bring the Joker to justice. The Joker is a hard guy to find. Adopting his old gimmick would get his attention. The Red Hood would take over Gotham's criminal underworld... Kill him. ...so I could mitigate their damage on Gotham. The Red Hood would disrupt their illegal trafficking... Kill them all. ...so I could keep them alive, So they can spread the word. Gotham City belongs to the Red Hood. Kill them all. And without spilling a drop of blood, as I promised. That'll get Joker's attention. Don't know what that maniac is up to, but nobody make a move until I give the order. I'm a little teapot, short and stout. Here is my handle, here is my spout. Who's that? Get a light on him. Hey! Look at you. Mr. Hood! Or do you prefer Red? You know, I used to wear an outfit a lot like that. Mine was more flashy maître d' than motorcycle fetish. You kids today. I'm sorry, could you hold on? I was just in the middle of setting fire to your gang. You really think I'll let you get away with that? Don't know. I just wanted your attention. You've always had my attention. That's why you're here now. I'm sorry. That seems to imply that you organized this little clambake. Now you're catching on. And now I'm catching you. Hey, now, where did you go, Hoodsey? We were having such a nice... Aah! That wasn't nice! Damn it! All officers, hang clear of that smoke. Break out the gas masks. What the... Ha! Gotchal! Sorry. Was that rude? I never did learn those manners. Huh? One... bad... day. Oh! Kid! You have done your papa proud. Batman? Doubt he would agree. Not that papa. This one. Look at you. Gave up the gimmicks he gave you, and now you're the spitting image of me. I took your gimmicks to draw you out and take you down for what you did to me and to him! Oh! Losing Batsy got me, too. Right in the ticker. Thought about hanging it all up until you rode into town. The timing, the irony. I knew there was a joke under that hood, but I never saw this punchline coming. Who knew you were a natural-born killer just like me? I'm not like you. I don't Kill! Don't be modest. I admire your work. Your entrance on the scene was one for the books, baby. You co-opted the head of every crime syndicate in Gotham by beheading their lieutenants! Delightful! A+ material. And the way you punched holes in Gotham's illegal trade lines? By blasting holes through the traders! Hilarious! Two thumbs up. Oh! And the piece de resistance. Black Mask. Boy, did you find a way to cut him out. So good! You get all the points. No. I-I didn't. I couldn't. I-I promised Batman. Batman? Wait a second. You actually don't remember. You've been repressing all of it! Kill them all. Kill them all. Kill them all. That's the best joke I ever heard! This isn't Batman. This isn't your inner demons. This is you. The deep down inside you. That day in Bosnia was your birthday. I got you your crowbar, a little song, a little dance, a little dynamite in your pants, and you were reborn! Hallelujah! Without your proud papa Joker there to slap you on the ass, without the Dark Knight going nighty night forever, you wouldn't be the fine, upstanding, eyes open, gun-toting psychopathic survivor you are today! So, admit it, son... Who's your daddy? Kill the Joker. Justice was served. A murder. A death sentence. Execution was in order. Carried out by me. I know Bruce is probably flipping in his grave over it. But I did the right thing. And now that Robin is a jailbird serving a life sentence... well, now I can serve justice from the inside. You're under arrest! No sudden moves, man. I know [ failed Batman. I'm sure he's spinning in his grave... But with his dying breath, Joker showed me the truth. Evil can't be cured. Only killed. Give me your purse! You want a knife in your neck? - No, please! - Come on! If I'd just had the right tools that night in Bosnia... Whoa! Hey, I give up. Don't shoot! New details are emerging tonight from a grisly murder scene in downtown Gotham City. Several notorious crime lords were gunned down in cold blood. A witness in the area reported seeing a masked gunman with the letter "R" on his chest. The question under investigation tonight, did Batman's former protege, Robin, strike again? Moments after the Dark Knight apprehended Barbara Ann Minerva, AKA Cheetah, she was shot and killed by a yet-to-be-identified sniper. He's been dubbed the Red Robin for his blood-soaked rampage through the criminal underworld. But many citizens are unnerved by Batman's murderous former partner. The Red Robin is considered armed and extremely dangerous. Police Commissioner James Gordon has launched an all-out manhunt to find the elusive vigilante. And the GCPD urges all citizens, should you encounter Red Robin anywhere in Gotham, immediately find cover and keep your head down. - It's Red Robin! - What's happening? We're all gonna die! Hah! You're fresh out of guys, Freak-Face. Your turn. Oh, Rob, are you making this personal? Or are you just getting your rocks off? Oh, yeah, that's the look. You're not the first to come after us for revenge. So, who did we Kill? Girlfriend, sibling, mama, papa? Daddy issues, huh? Those will drive you batty. But you've got other things to worry about now. Like, will we leave you to bleed out, or put the next bullet in your head? You might call this-- Say "double jeopardy," and I'll shove that coin down your throat with my bloody stump. That's the spirit, kid. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the vicious, murderous vigilante, Red Robin, awaits a verdict. Will he get life, or will he get death? As if we'd leave the choice to you filthy animals. My little friend will make the call. Fate wants me to do some good today. I'll start by saving Gotham City from the mass murderer, Red Robin. Your verdict, guilty! My judgement, death. Burn in hell, Two-Face. - No, please! - Don't look. Robin, stop! Please don't kill Two-Face. Evil can't be cured, kid. Only killed. No, no! It can be caged, rehabilitated. Robin, this isn't you. You used to be good when you worked with Batman. Now you're the bad guy. Robin, whatever made you become Red Robin, killing Two-Face won't change it. You have to be strong. I know he shot you, but use the pain to be strong. Stronger than Two-Face. You have to be strong. Be strong for Batman. Use this pain to be strong, son. ...protecting Gotham. For your family. ...helping others, Barbara, Dick, healed me. I want that for you, because I love you, son. You're a spooky kid, you know that? You win. So, what do we do now? Um... You got a name? Tim. Tim Drake. Evil can't be cured, only killed. Whoever said that is a jackass. It took a death sentence from Two-Face to show me what I had become. It took a kid holding my own gun on me to show me the way back. To remind me of Bruce's dying words. Remind me of what Batman stood for, what he fought to give everyone. A second chance. Barbara, Dick and Alfred are making sure I don't forget that. So is Tim. But these days, we just call him Batkid. Fate's not on your side today, kid. Spare me the damn speech and get it over with. I'm starting to wonder if fate was ever on your side, at all. Look at you. You used to fly with the Bat. You used to stand for something. Now, you're like a coin on its edge. You're nothing. Gotham fears you. Batman's chasing you. And normally, I'd just kill you, but I can't kill what's already dead inside. The worst I can do is let you live with what you are. A perfect failure. I know I feel bad for him. Now, that's a fate worse than death. Live with that for the rest of your miserable life. However long that is. See you in hell, kid. Promise you'll be strong, son. For your family, Barbara and Dick. Promise you'll be strong. I promise. Freeze! Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall. Humpty Dumpty had a great fall. I so badly needed understanding, forgiveness. Barbara told me to surrender to her father. All the king's horses... Dick tried to arrest me. ...and all the king's men... And Bruce... ...couldn't put Robin together again. Zur-En-Arrh. Who... Who are you? He is certainly not the mannequin I arranged for you to bury. He is my beloved. Your father, he is Batman. Talia. Ra's resurrected him in the Lazarus Pit? My father wouldn't risk the Lazarus process after Batman's death in Bosnia. I would not stand by and allow him such a trivial demise. As my father feared, the pit drove Bruce to madness. But I chose my beloved for his exceptional strength of mind. With time, with care, my brilliant detective and warrior returned to me. Zur-En-Arrh. Though his capacity for speech is limited, he has spoken with his body and given himself to me. You sick, twisted-- When Batman donned the colors of his former protege, it was clear he wanted you to join us. Your recent actions prove your worth to the League of Assassins. And to the house of al Ghul. I have done things that will haunt me forever. I know Batman would be disappointed in me, because I know Batman. More than ever before. And I know Bruce would never allow what Batman stood for to be corrupted by you. Neither will I. Jason, it is not me you must convince of that. Zur-En-Arrh. Freeze! Zur-En-Arrh. Who... Who are you? He is certainly not the mannequin I arranged for you to bury. He is my beloved. Your father, he is Batman. Talia. Ra's resurrected him in the Lazarus Pit? My father wouldn't risk the Lazarus process after Batman's death in Bosnia. I would not stand by and allow him such a trivial demise. As my father feared, the pit drove Bruce to madness. But I chose my beloved for his exceptional strength of mind. With time, with care, my brilliant detective and warrior returned to me. Zur-En-Arrh.

And I know Bruce would never allow what Batman stood for to be corrupted by you. Neither will I. Jason, it is not me you must convince of that. Zur-En-Arrh. We spent years training together and fighting side by side. I know his moves. He knows mine. And none of that will help me now. This isn't Batman. He died in Bosnia. That's all that matters. Zur-En-Arrh. We spent years training together and fighting side by side. I know his moves. He knows mine. And none of that will help me now. Bruce never stopped trying to save my soul. Now I'm gonna save his. Or die trying. Always the defiant one, Jason. Batman was too soft on you, but the League will tame you. Tame this. It was a long way back from where I'd gone, but my family took me back to heal. So we could all heal. That's what family does. To that end, Barbara returned to duty as a sort of oracle, streaming live intel and support to Dick while he patrolled Gotham. Flashbacks, nightmares, PTSD. I'm still working through stuff. Not ready for the field yet. But I am finding the strength Bruce saw inside me all along. The strength to just stop and heal. The strength to be part of a family. Bruce united us as that family. Now we're united to heal him. The effects of the Lazarus Pit made him a danger to us, to himself and to his legacy. A legacy we would protect as we searched for a cure with the hope that we might one day save Bruce Wayne as he saved me. Hey, Dad! Imagine if Zorro came riding through Gotham on his horse right now! Well, Bruce, I'm not so sure a masked vigilante would be welcomed in Gotham City. Sadly, they'd probably just lock someone like Zorro in Arkham. Zorro in Arkham. Zorro in Ark... Zor. En. Arr. Zor. En. Arr. Zor. En. Arr. Zor. En. Arr.
