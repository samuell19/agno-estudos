Sir, where's the International Settlement? The Settlement? Far away. $20. Decide right now. For $20, I'll walk. Which way? Heartless sods. Careful, it's hot. Two pieces. Where's the International Settlement? Look for yourself. He can't read. He can't read? Sir, excuse me... Thanks. What's he running off for? Old man, where's the piece of paper? The piece I just gave you. Maybe I used it to wrap the smelly bean curd. Which one? The police are coming. Police. Excuse me... Watch out! Sorry. Why so late? All here? One missing. Wait for me. You're the only one missing. Where's the address? Even the blind knows how to get there. Then please lead the way Okay. Start the car. Wait. Be on the ball. Help will be here once we set the fire. Be alert. Among friends old or new, it's the one in need that counts. I'm Pai. Mr Pai, I'm Chen Dawen. Let's go in for a chat. Good. Sorry to have to trouble you to bring the money from the US. Don't mention it. I've done my share of evil when I was in Shanghai. Being able to contribute to the revolution will give me consolation in my old age. Mr Pai, please keep it for me. Excuse me for a moment. Take your time. Young man, not prepared for such a situation! Anybody in? Open up. Open up. Anyone in? Anybody in? Open up. Anybody in? Who is it? Why are you here? It's burning! What's it to do with me? What do you take me for? Helping a man put out fire! Listen, Miss, 8 men are about to set fire outside. Arson? Yes. Uncle, he wants to see the boss. Are you the boss? No I'm not. I'm the manager of the acrobatic troupe. That man in front is the boss. Thank you. What is it? He said someone's toeching the place. Is that so? Fire, fire! Go down quickly to have a look. Go quickly to have a look. Keep away! Make way. Come on. Follow them! My money! Don't take away the bag! Yes. Run! I can't hold on. Pack up quickly. Run! Fling the bag over! Watch out! It's okay, run. After them! What are you doing? They've taken the bag. It's a triad squabble. Keep out of it! Let's go! Oh, no! Why? I didn't any of my assets! Put it down. All right? Yes. The fire's spreading fast. Little Tiger, you're excellent. Oh, you're superb! It's nothing. You'll be idle now that it's burnt down. Never mind, we were planning to move to a new stage anyway. Right, be sure to come to cheer us on. That kid did it? Yes. So he's with those acrobats. Boss, these acrobats will soon perform in our Great World. You'll suffer then. Don't forget. Okay, I'll keep my promise. Right now I must see big brother. Do you know where the British Barracks are? Over there. No, over there. Over there? Run! Stop! Halt! Stop! Don't! Teng Hung, we have evidence that you are trafficking drugs. Come with me. This is the International Settlement. We're all Chinese. Why should we hurt each other. To the benefit of foreigners? Righteousness has no boundary. A criminal is a criminal. Remember, you said it. My dad's influential in the North. Let's see who suffers? I haven't suffered for a long time. Take him! Halt! Finish me off if you have the nerve. Fire, fire! Shoot me dead then! See if you can live with the blame I can always say it's an industrial accident. It'll be safer for you to surrender. Otherwise, accidents may continue. Great! Permit, please. Permit. Bad! I'm Little Tiger, looking for my brother, Big Tiger. I'm Little Tiger, my brother is Big Tiger. I said permit, okay? What Tiger? You're impossible. Stay put! I'm not going to shoot, but don't move. This is a minefield. What did you say? Stop there! Big Tiger. Little Tiger, don't move! What? Don't move, this is a minefield. I'm coming over. Don't! Big brother, I've found you at last. What did you say, big brother? I nearly lost a brother. What? You're lucky. Let's go. Is Mom all right? Yes. Are the elders all right? Yes. Mom wants me to join you. She said I could make money being a cop like you. Money? You expect a cop to make money? Can't a cop make money? It's unscrupulous for a cop to get bribes. It's ignorant to expect wealth out of a cop. Brother, are you unscrupulous or ignorant? Neither. My inventions are more satisfying. This telescope. You can see the home town. Can I? Yes, if there are no barriers. And this gramophone can turn male voices into female voices. Brother, now I see why you can't make money. Preposterous! Little Tiger, just a minute! Have you released Teng Hung? Sometimes one has to be a bit diplomatic. Diplomatic? Idiot! I have got ample evidence against him. Colonel, we can't wipe out the societies in Shanghai this way. Your duty is not be hero but to maintain stability and prosperity. Are we to let him go like that? Colonel, don't you know the difference? Science is rigid but the law is flexible Devote more energy to your new mission. New mission? Chin Hung-yun's goddaughter's coming to Shanghai. Your duty is to protect her. You know Mr Chin is a VIP in Shanghai. His goddaughter is equally important. Understand? A ladies' man. Big brother, are we going to a funeral? Nonsense. Shanghai's now in chaos. International Settlement, French Concession, etc Koumintang, Communists, Revolutionaries, etc And Red, Yellow, Blue, White and Black societies too. Don't swagger. Avoid the crowd. Remember. Don't offend anyone. You can get into a lot of trouble. Is that so? Out of order again How ingenious! My invention servers both as a watch and a compass. No wonder it points at 6:30 only. This photo really is presentable. Give it back to me. Here we are. Be careful! A surging crowd. Which one is it? Foreigners call her Mary Sung. Marry soon? Who's marrying soon? It's Mary Sung. Mary Sung? I'm here. It's been a long time, how are you? Since when have you adopted an English name? Brother, she looks familiar. Your "6:30". My brother Little Tiger, Miss Sung Chia-pi How do you do? It's been some time. How's Ting-ting? She's okay. She's now well known in Shanghai She's versatile; scientist, scholar, artist. Is that so? And the girlfriend of my superior, Pottinger. You... We've split up. Excuse me. Brother, an old flame? None of your business. I know nothing. Except you still have her photo after all these years. I'm the soul of discretion. Make hay... Be flexible. Sorry. Miss Sung, excuse me. You go on. Excuse me. Bye-bye. Your present mission is... A ladies' man. Napoleon is my idol. Is that so? You play him well today. Miss Sung Chia-pi. Please. Chia-pi. Godfather. I missed you. I rushed back for your birthday party. Good girl. How's your father doing in Honolulu? Still supporting the scientists' solar energy research? He's busier than I am. Yes. This colonel is a science fan too. He's erudite and takes an interest in anything. He deeply analyses things that interest him. You flatter me. I am totally devoted to love. Is that your superior? Yes. Ting-ting's a charming girl. Yes. Chia-pi. Take it easy, I must go for my make-up. To give you a chance. Godfather, I'm going up to change. Okay. My goddaughter is both beautiful and capable. She's sagacious too. She has the same personality as you. The more I see you, the more you look like my crony. Who's it? Chia-pi's father. In appearance? In personality. Both are men of principle devoted to science. Both are unbending in spirit. Mr Jean Paul of the French Concession. Excuse me. Ting-ting Chia-pi. I missed you. I was afraid I wouldn't get a warm welcome. You're able, and prettier than me. I'm a bit terrified. You've been crowned No.1. Don't act otherwise. You met many foreigners in the US. Is a Chinatown kid more to your liking? You're the expert in this. Of all the Chinese elite in Shanghai, you picked a foreigner for a boyfriend. Splendid. Since you left, I've had no one to quarrel with. Now you're giving me the chance again. After those years, I'm afraid I may not be as fluent as you. Right. Let's try not to argue any more. Let's not quarrel over anything again. I made concessions to you each time. Remember? Chia-pi, this is General Pottinger. A politician, businessman, philanthropist. He's an expert in everything. He must be Mr Invincible! True. But it's lonely being invincible. I was lonely till I met you. May I? Sorry, I promised to dance with the Colonel. Go and dance. Excuse me. He's my superior and you're using me to let him down. That's to thank you for the honor you brought to us Chinese. Excuse my misunderstanding. We never understood each other well. We haven't changed after these years. You're as sharp-tongued as ever. You're as romantic too. Don't compare me to Ting-ting. We're different. Are you? What has that to do with me? Why are you so excited then? Me, excited? Forget it. A girl never means what she says. Why did you leave secretly for USA? I wouldn't fight with others. You couldn't decide, so I decided it. I didn't fail to decide. Didn't you? Seems men never mean what they say too. In fact, we're agreeable dancing partners. The Japanese are ambitious. They want to extend from Manchuria to Shanghai. Changes are inevitable. Be alert. Grab the opportunity to make money, right? Birds of a feather... Our feeling is mutual. Waiting for your girl? How do you know? Here's to your success. Are you talking honestly? Don't be a hypocrite, like my boss. I mean your flying project. I was busy last time you test-flew. I definitely will come this time. Am I welcome? With open arms. Cheers! Shanghai is lucky to have me. I love Shanghai. Miss Sung, I'm Chen Dawen. How are you? How are you, Mr Chen? What shall I do? Open the safe in your godfather's reading room. We suspect it contains greenbacks. Have you got the code numbers? Yes, 36, 24, 36 Good luck. It's my duty. I'll squeeze in to avoid suspicion. I must leave now. What are you doing? All right? I'm alright. I've fallen for you completely. You are a vision of beauty. Unfortunately, you're so far away. Be alert. I'm going in. Remember 36, 24, 36 How come it's empty? Chia-pi. So you're here. I've been looking around for you. I didn't see you outside so I came looking for you. We're playing hide-and-seek. Chia-pi, you're too old for this game now. Play something else. Godfather, your ring... Your dad's got one too. We're close friends. We worked together when young. We shared in good times and bad. Your dad likes science but is not gifted. But he's been lucky all his life. I'm easygoing and adventurous. Sensing that China is backward. He decided to go abroad for higher learning. Me, I wouldn't forsake Shanghai. So I stayed. Then we each went our own way. He went abroad, I've taken root here. You've made it, you're now the richest man in Shanghai. The older the greedier. One's lust is never satiated. Your dad's achieved much for having a daughter like you. Don't poke fun at me. You know why I adore you so much? Because you're closer in personality to me than to your dad. You mean my wildness? I don't admit it. You're intelligent and full of youthful vigor. Remember to persevere like I do. Fight to the end. I'm no fool, you can't hide it from me. Love is a battle. Fight and never give up. Colonel, Miss Sung would like to attend your flying test. Big Tiger. Big Tiger, are you all right? Are you all right? Yes. This large kite looks okay. But it doesn't work. In the last flying test, several men got killed. Are you all right? Yes. You're quite skilled but your plane's no good. It was made in England. Big Tiger used it for reference only. Is that so? I know little about science. Show me. It all depends on one's talent. Have I got any talent? Yes. My plane will have its first test flight next week. Would you care to be present? Yes Yes. Be lively. Chiang told us to wreak havoc. Freshen up Are you here to sleep? Ladies & gentlemen, flying daggers of the Swallow Acrobatic Troupe. Same old thing, the hell with it. We're here to see the burlesque. Pack up. This will be followed by flying daggers. Pack up! What lousy skills. Now it's the Flying Pyramid. Great! Pao, are you all right? That bastard switched off the light. Show up if you dare. Ladies & gentlemen, the burlesque. How could you perform with such inferior skills? Chiang, we missed only because the light suddenly went off. I noticed. But you were clumsy too before it went off. All because the audience hurled objects at us. Isn't that nice for you? You can hardly expect any audience from now on. You mean... You'd better return to the countryside. Shanghai's not the place for you So you're using this to fire us? Did you switch off the light deliberately? Did you see me doing it? You're not tough enough. Chiang, we're quitting. Make good the toll and medical fees. I couldn't care less. Every day someone gets ruined in Shanghai. If you can't make a living, make her a whore. A fight. Come here. Hit him, come on. Run, Pao. Run. Run. What happened? Run? Want a fight? Come on, then! I can't be bothered with you. Where are Huang Mao and Fat Chen? Where are they? Let's go back to look for them. No point in going back now. There must be a way. Mr Chin, there's a good show at Great World tonight. We caught two acrobats. Now get two burly chaps to beat them to death in 30 minutes. Beat to death? Isn't that exciting? Mr Chin, bet some money. What's the fun in that anymore? We all progress but you resort to killing. We only want to make some money. We're way behind you on that. We got such a small cut of greenbacks. We must try something big. What do you mean? To confront me? Oh, no. We asked you to bet all because our men risked their lives to get back the greenbacks for you. Now take care of them. If you're not in the mood I'll tell them the truth. You know, forget what I said. Well, I'll bet those two kids won't die. If I lose, you get the money. But if I win give everything to the men. They're unlucky then. Beat the crap out of him! Beat him! Freeze! Anyone that moves is dead! Shoot him, gun him down! Never mind, gun him down. Run quickly. Run! Pao, this way. Switch off, switch off everything. Trun the light on him. You bastards, how dare you? Right, a new program for tonight. $500 for finishing off one, $1,000 for two $4,000 for three Shoot whoever the light catches. It's me. Go now. I'm here. Drop your gun. Hear that? Creep, jump. Jump! Where's your gun? I don't carry one. The dagger? Drop it! You're the only one invited by Chin Hung-yun It says you stand to gain. Is it reliable? Little Tiger, you're excellent in kung fu, we'll go with you. At worst we'll fight with him. Don't be silly. I've been in Shanghai long enough to know this. He could finish off with his pinkie. They say he did in Mr Pai. We'd better not go. It could be an opportunity for us. He didn't need an invitation to hurt us. We're in Shanghai to try our luck. Not to get bumped off. Remember, we did in his man Chiang. Opportunity knocks but once. We've got to grab the bull by the horns. I want to strike out on my own. Welcome, welcome. Little Tiger, go down please. You can't take a bath with your clothes on. We did that in the country. Hard to believe a group of young men were able to get into Great World to kill Chiang. He's only a three-star. You're a five-star. You're smart. Wit plus guts, you're worth four stars. Be my man and you'll have a bright future. We didn't come all this way to do evil deeds. What a kid! Nothing's absolutely good or bad In our encounters in the underworld. From time immemorial heroes have mixed both ways. Shanghai is like a pool. Jump in and you're half finished. You must be flexible to become a hero. Am I to help you with drugs and gambling? These sins are en vogue. I'll be delighted if you can change the trend. Well, young man, start with Great World and Heaven. You want a boost or a shove? I'm your elder. Change them in any way you like. See me if there are any problems. Big brother. I've found work with food and lodging. You needn't worry about me any more. Really? For you. Remember not to research it. What kind of work? This watch... Don't worry, I bought it. Here's the receipt. I'll come to see you when I have time. Bye. Little Tiger. What is your job now? An honest job. An honest job? You said the same to Mom. When you came to Shanghai to become a soldier. I was... Bad guys are aplenty. Some are good guys too. Remember? Yes. You left a letter for me before leaving. Little Tiger. Brother, don't worry, I'm OK. Bye. What's it? Not in the mood? I've seen my godfather's safe. What have you found? Nothing. Maybe someone else did it. Check carefully, don't be emotional. Sorry. I'm being emotional too. Miss Sung, if you love someone and you know it will end badly, what would you do? In this age, it makes no difference whether it will end up well or not. Why make me the leading star for a highly romantic story of this age? Had I got killed at Heaven I'd have been in peace. Heaven Chen Dawen, let's go to Heaven. We may find some clues there. Clues? Yes, maybe. Chan Dawen, brace yourself. Hurry up. Fill it up. Cheers. Mao, Wei, you both can drink. Little Tiger, what are you doing here alone? Remember the 1st day I met you? I came through the back door. Now we're both standing here. Isn't that like a dream? No, it's reality. It's just like Shanghai. Make good use of the opportunity. I'd like to open a full-day bank to offer low-interest loans to the needy. What do you think? I'm really excited. Come and have a drink then. Come on, let's drink. Little Tiger, it's a fun party. Have a dance with Pao. Dance? He came from the country. Wrong, I'm the Dancing King of 13 villages. Are you? Remember how it happened that day? Yes, I saw Pai in this ballroom that day. Suddenly someone yelled "fire"! While I tried to rush up to get back the money I was knocked unconscious in... That man in a foreign suit did it. Him? Yes, he made me lose a wad of greenbacks. A country kid in a foreign suit, something's fishy. Are you sure it was him? I can recognize him anywhere. Let me beat him up. I know him, let me do it. Girls are euphemistic in speech. No matter how, you have to say "May I have the honor of dancing with you?" Yes. May I have the honor of dancing with you? So it's you. May I have the honor? It's a friend. I must make something straight. Come here. Could she be Little Tiger's old flame? We're all friends. Come and have a drink. There are so many underworld people here. Aren't you scared to be a hatchet man here? I'm not the hit man, I'm in charge here. So you're now a big brother. Your brother would rather die first! It's all up to you. Give me back the $5 million. Do I look like one with so much money? You don't look like a big brother either. I know If I look like my brother, you'll like me. Stop pretending, or I'll be nasty. I like nasty people. Careful, if you get hurt, I wouldn't know how to tell my brother. It's the $5 million that counts. For my sake, let's talk about it later. Ladies and gentlemen, carry on dancing. Anyone else wants to join me? I never thought you're a revolutionary. The money represents revolutionary funds. It's vitally important for millions of Chinese in deep water. Now you know I'm clean. I promise to help you with investigation, but my identity... Don't let Big Tiger know my identity either. Miss Sung is my brother's girlfriend. What's the name of your new invention? Flying Moth No.1 It flies on the sliding principle, needs no engine. Beautiful! It's all made of rattan with an oriental flavor. Have you noticed the wing seems a bit short? Short? Let me show you. Why only two seats? It would be lonely for one only. The journey will be much pleasanter in the company of a close friend. Right? Great! Colonel, the dummy's fixed. Well, the first trial flight begins. Yes, sir We may fly out of the camp, but not Shanghai. Even if we could, we couldn't fly out of China. Science alone can't help change China. Don't you think so? Yes. So I was right, the wing's short. You're right. Little Tiger. Looking for me, sir? Yes, they say you're working for the Revolutionary Party. I... Little Tiger, the revolution is not for people like us. Shanghai is international and a land of plenty. Don't mess it up. They're not making trouble. They're not bringing new hope to millions of brethren. Politics is dirty and intriguing. Don't let yourself be used, idiot. Lots of people lose their lives before the revolution succeeds. Whoever moves first dies first. History tells us few revolutionaries can reap the benefits. Can you enjoy the fruit once it succeeds? I'm no revolutionary and take no interest in politics. But I have high respect for those revolutionaries. That's why I'm helping them recover the funds. Those who snatched the money must be powerful persons with their political standpoint. You're my man, I don't want you to get involved. There are many other things for you to do in Shanghai. And lots of money for you to get too. Help me with my business to make more money. Had I not known about the funds robbery I would've strived hard to make money too. Now conscience dictates that I get involved. So you're insisting on your own principles? You look up to me because of this, sir. Everyone has a conscience, right? Take care. Colonel, we got a tip-off the Revolutionary Party is meeting. You and your deputy try to blend in. Yes sir. Here? Who's the boss of this dying mill? A rich overseas Chinese in the US. He's handed over the management to his daughter. He's named Sung. Sung? Yes. The dyestuff here is pungent. My godfather? Yes. The source of information is... Someone close to Pottinger. Pottinger. The conspiracy between Pottinger and your godfather has been under our observation. Have you any evidence? You don't want it to be your godfather. But our information is correct. Captain, we're ready. This may be the boss's daughter. Brothers, there is a sour smell from this dyeing mill. But our heart may be even more sour. The smell here only comes from the dye. But it's blood that comes from the people of China ceded by the warlords. Brothers, we mustn't keep silent. Right. We must unite and contribute all our strength. Right. We were regarded a plate of loose sand. I hope we can... Gunshots. Don't move. The 4th squadron of the Settlement Discipline Force. Go now. The polluted water's gushing out. Go quickly. Catch it! So it's you. I didn't expect you. Are you here to catch me or help me? Both. Forget it. Go now, I'll stay. Ting-ting. So you're the one closest to Pottinger. Well done, but it's not fair to you. You've sacrificed love for the revolution. If Big Tiger knows, he... Forget it. A white fabric, once dyed, is no longer white. Anything, once gone, can never return. But, you mean everything to him. It makes no difference now. We've been fighting since childhood, remember? Each time there was a result, but not now. General, what do you want me for at this hour? There's news the Japanese may invade Shanghai at any time. I've got the same news, the situation is critical. What do the British plan to do? They're ready to leave any time. But it's going to be an honorable retreat. And they want their fortune too. In fact, we two must do likewise quickly. Big Tiger discovered your goddaughter is a revolutionary. But didn't report it. His adjutant told me that. I knew already. People are strange. I'm nice to them and they go against me. I give advantage to them, and they bite my hand. To leave faster, we must keep quiet. To reap the most, we must find stand-ins. Little Tiger, Chia-pi, Big Tiger, I gave you a chance but you wouldn't give yourself a chance. You know the saying "two birds with one stone"? What? Who's in charge of Great World now? They've recently made a replacement. A very capable man. They say the one in charge is a new underworld member. What's his name? Little Tiger. What's his last name? Who are you looking for? I want to see your manager. Sorry, sir, it could be a young lady. What's it, sir? Are you Little Tiger? I'm Little Vixen, not an old one. Are you in charge here? Yes, can I help you? Does this big chair suit you? I like to shake my foot. It feels better. Big brother, you? So it really is you. So you're making a deal. What did you say, big brother? So you're all lying to me? I have not lied to you. Don't deny it. You're working in such a place. And you say you are good people? Soldiers aren't the only good people. Have you read "All Men Are Brothers"? You don't have to be a thug. Don't say that. We also do charity too. So he's a Robin Hood. Hand over the opium at once. What opium? Quit pretending. You're acting against conscience You've never done well since childhood. Now you're in such a side line. Are you very special? You're just a lackey, really. Me, I can be regarded a leader. I command respect and am rich. Go back to the camp to preach your principles. Our principle is to round you all up. According to my tip-off, you killed Chiang and took over his territory. Now you're under arrest. Chiang deserved his death. I killed him. So what? You'll have to be arrested too. She didn't do it. Don't arrest her. Why don't I just get you some opium so you can do your report? So you did it, you creep. Don't be so irrational. I don't want you to return empty-handed and get demoted. Don't worry about me. Worry about yourself! You may face the firing squad, understand? You bought this with your dirty money too? Hai, are you all right? Colonel, your underworld brother is now under arrest. For drug trafficking to the detriment of society. I really didn't know... Neither did I till I came... Don't defend yourself. You intended to warn him, knowing I would raid it. You told me to come, so you... Shut up. We now have all the evidence. Take them all away. Little Tiger, we're innocent. Hai was gunned down when He saw them ship the opium in. Don't move. Tell them to drop their guns. Don't try anything. Drop your guns. Drop your guns, all of you, you hear? Little Tiger, get out of here, the farther the better. You'd better leave Shanghai. What about you, big brother? Just as you said, I have principles. I'm a soldier, I'll bear all consequences. Go quickly. Big brother, let's go together. You want all of us caught? Won't you listen to me? Run quickly. Run, Little Tiger. Give us a hand. Run! Thank you. Chia-pi, why are you here at this hour? The situation is critical. You know the camp well. Chen Dawen's waiting for you. Go and help Big Tiger quickly. And you? My cover's blown. I have to face my godfather. I'll be responsible for the greenback case. Your godfather's good. You won't stand a chance. I've been followed from the day I joined the revolution. There's no chance for the revolution. I won't give up at this juncture. What about you and Big Tiger? We stand no chance. After rescuing him, go to Hong Kong with him. I've already got the tickets. But... Ting-ting, so it's you. We've come to help you. How come? Let's escape now. we'll explain to you later. Ting-ting, let's go out to see how things are. You escape if anything happens. I can cope by myself. Go this way, idiot. There are many soldiers outside. What's that sound? Go in and see. Where are they? Damn, they escaped. Follow them. Run quickly. Come on, come on. Catch him! Follow me Don't run. Where's that idiot? Where's he? You... Big Tiger. Follow them quickly. Hurry up. I want them alive! Don't run. Come over here! Chen Dawen. He turned around and fled. It's coming over! Well, you've made it. You're great! Hit the switch. You dare to come back? I must get back the revolution fund. For all my love, you turn against me! Is it your way of repayment? Can you face the people of China? How can such a small fund help so many Chinese? So might as well let me have it. Obey me and you get your cut. Otherwise, excuse me for being ruthless. Godfather, get this straight. I'm not like you. I take after my dad. My dad hasn't done a thing against China. You're here but so heartless. Trying to steal the national salvation fund! You expecting a good emperor after this? They are also in a dog-eat-dog world. You have no right to lecture me. Stay overnight, for your father's sake. Tomorrow I'll send you back to the US. Godfather Godfather... Miss Sung, sorry for that. Mr Chin says to stay one more night. Tomorrow we'll send you to the ship. Stop her! Miss Sung, please stop. You're detestable! With me here, you don't talk. You may be top dog in the gang but I have justice on my side. I've told you, the robber is no ordinary man. I told you to quit opposing me! Wait. What for? It hurts. Come on. Go away! Don't force me to kill. Scram! Stop fighting! Don't move! Capture them. Don't move! Trying to uproot me? My time's come. You can't stop me. Jump down fast. Ting-ting. Fire! Get into the yard quickly! Big brother, the gun. There's gunpowder on the aircraft. Come to Hong Kong later. I love Shanghai, I'll stay here. Aren't you afraid it may fall? In any case, I must stay to be a witness. Besides, I have confidence. Hope you're right. Big brother, do you like democracy or science? Is there any choice? I'm coming. Wait for me. Don't go.
