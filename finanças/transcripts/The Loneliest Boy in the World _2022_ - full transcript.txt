I don't know how you could be so insensitive, Julius. He has problems. That need to be dealt with within the framework of an institution. Well, that's a psychiatrist's solution to everything, isn't it? Lock him up? It's my professional opinion, which I still can't believe the court ignored. Nobody ignored you, Julius. They just didn't agree with you. Look, Oliver needs our support. His mother isolated him from the outside world from the time he was born. So I find it hardly surprising that he wouldn't feel a little lost when she had her accident. I just hope he finds a friend. Fifty bucks says that's never gonna happen. God, you are unbelievable, you know that? Ten bucks. You are on. ♪ We are burning With the spark ♪ ♪ And we can walk on water ♪ ♪ We are tigers in the dark ♪ ♪ We are burning ♪ Hi, chief. Read any good magazines or anything? Oh. Hello Mr. Carter, Miss Seale. May we come in? Could you come back tomorrow? My mother's favorite soap is on. Looks like she's gonna miss it. That's why I have to watch it. Um, we were just coming by to... check up on your goldfish. Is he okay? Bruce is resting right now. Oliver, you like living here, don't you? In your old house? Yeah. And you don't wanna go back to the psychiatric home? Remember, next week that becomes a reality. So we're gonna have to prove to the court that you fit in, and the best way to do that... ...and maybe the only way to do that in the next seven days... ...is to make some friends. How? What do I say? Making friends is easy, Oliver. Just be natural. Be truthful. Be you. I'd say you just fucked up his life forever. I hope you enjoy your flight, sir. Thank you for flying with us. Oliver, you like living here, - don't you? In your old house? - Yeah. And you don't wanna go back to the psychiatric home? Remember, next week that becomes a reality. So we're gonna have to prove to the court that you fit in, and the best way to do that, and maybe the only way... to do that in the next seven days, is to make some friends. Hi. Hey. Do you mind? Sure. I was just about to leave, so... You're a freak! Thank you! What a fucking asshole! Why did he say that? He was just being sociable. You're... you're weird. Thanks. I'm... new here. Um, I'll see you around. Around? Usually, I stay inside a lot. I like to watch television. My dad, yeah, he works at the factory. What does yours do? Not much. He's dead at the moment. Oh, I'm so sorry. What about your mom? She had an accident... sort of. Oh... that's terrible. Wow. Can I ask what happened? Well... It was about a year ago. It was a beautiful day and we were in the back garden. Oliver, will you light me another cigarette? My hands are all wet. Sure, Mom. You're so sweet to me. Mom,... ...I was thinking maybe, sometime next week or next month, we could go on a trip. You've been doing so well in your study, sweetie. You deserve a special treat. I was thinking that maybe we could... go some place where they have other kids. I don't think that's very... We'll see, closer to the time. Oh, would you grab my glasses? I can't see the screen very well. Can I get the new camera? I wanna take a picture. Of course you can, sweetie. Okay, okay, wait. Ready? Smile. So, how's your mother? I gotta go. She came into the house, and they just kissed and kissed and kissed, and then it ended. It's off tonight, so... tomorrow I'll bring you up to date with how he's getting along on Earth. I, uh,... I nearly made a friend today, Mom... ...but she ran off. I hope I can see her again one day. Isn't that your next door neighbor? Shame he can't find the words for the gravestone. He's a good kid. Yeah, yeah. He's our kind of people. Burrito? Burrito. I mean, you know me, pick and choose at this point. You should have kissed her dude, should've got her. Hey, guys. - What's up, buddy? - How you doing? Is he coming in here? Uh, listen to me, if he actually does... Definitely coming in. Guys, guys, guys, guys... - Hi. - Hi! Yay. How's it going? You wanna come sit with us? Oh! Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry. Get that shit up. What a loser, man. Go cry to your mommy. Look at him, do you see his jeans? He's a loser. ...fanna, fanna, fo, fesident, me, my, mo, mesident... I'm the president, yeah! Eenie, meenie, miney... Good boy. Come on, Oliver, just make it up. Mom needs to know what happened on the TV. Alf was fantastic last night. He makes Brian this model of the solar system, which he takes to school. - Hiya. - And... Hiya. Hi. We buried her, you know. Thank you very much. Ah. It's our job. I haven't seen any dogs around here. Oh, yeah. We just got him. -For security. -Yeah. But he was being a real bad doggy this morning, so... Yeah, had to leave him at home. And Casey savaged the Warners. You know, we don't just dig graves. We run tours of the place. Yeah, that's right, yeah. We tell the stories of all the people who, uh, you know, live here. Well, that sounds very interesting. You should tag along one day, free of charge. Thank you, but I'm a little busy at the moment. You see... I'm looking for a friend. A noble quest. Search near and far, high and low. You got this, man. What? - Hey. - Come on! - Thanks. - I'm sorry, I, - I thought you... - It's okay. What am I saying? What? Nope. No, I got you, all right. See ya. We are gathered here today to witness the passing of Mitch... Oh, yeah, so, the science teacher obviously hadn't heard about the two planets that were past Pluto called Dave and Alvin. So I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,... ...I will fear no evil for you are with me. Dust to dust, ashes to ashes. Amen. Amen. I told him going to school in America was a bad idea. He should have stayed in England with me. Everybody liked Mitch. He had so many friends. He was everybody's friend. Nah-ah. You know what? Let's go around the side. Give him a little surprise. God. Oliver? We were just coming to check up on you. Everything's fine. Any luck finding a friend? Oh, yeah. That's marvelous news. His name's Mitch. Have you brought him here yet? Uh, no. Oh, you must. He'll love this place. Where does he live? Not that far away. Well, you should just dig him on out of there and drag him home. You really think I should? Of course, it's a must. It'll be fun. Congratulations. Oh, yeah. All right, let's get outta here. Come on. Just as I suspected, he is delusional. You're being ridiculous. Oliver is about to have the first taste of life. Hi, I'm Oliver. You must be Mitch. It's kinda cold out here. Wanna come back to my house? You'll love it. I understand if you're a little nervous about... getting into the car again after what happened last time, but... I'm a really careful driver. I promise. Hi. Hi. This is Mitch. Hello, Mitch. Mitch is my first friend. It was good to meet both of you. I think she liked you. Home sweet home. Can I get you anything? You're so easy to have around. I met your mother, by the way. She seemed fine. She misses you, I think. Maybe my mother misses me, too. She had an accident, you know. It was a beautiful day,... ...and we were sitting in the back garden. Here to fix the television set, sir. That's great. This may not be the best time. Could you come back later? Cool shades, man. It just died, huh? The TV? Yeah, it just died. They both did. Can I get you anything? -Huh? -Can I get you anything? Oh, Cola. Chill. Sure. Okay. There is no constellation in visual distance. No stellar explosion. Huh, it works. Put it there, man. Cheers. Thank you. Gotta go. Nice to meet ya, and your friend. Take it easy, boys. You want one? Could you stop... could you stop the car? Oliver! Are you okay? - Oh, hi. - Hi. Can I... What you got? Oh, that's uh, that's for Mitch. He's getting cold. Sure. Um... Look, I, I wanna apologize about the other day. Um, I didn't mean to run off, it was just... really intense for me. Um, I mean it, it must have been... fucking horrible to see... something like that... and... Yeah, I'm just really, I'm really sorry about your mom. Um... Nothing can replace family. And then they bump into this woman, Jody. Brian's terrified because he thinks they're gonna give Alf away to the alien task force. Doug, what are you doing over there? We're taking a break. But luckily Jody turns out to be blind, so... she just thinks that Alf is a short and hairy human and everything's fine. I, uh... I really wanted to tell you about my new friend, Mitch. He's just like you in some ways. Uh, listen, I, I've got a lot of things to do today. Will you just... will you just watch my things, okay? Hi, Doug. Ooh. - How is everything? - Never better. People have been dropping like flies. I did not know that. There's two big accidents on the highway and a botulism epidemic at the hospital. The morgue is full to bursting. We've been working around the clock to deal with the backlog. There's whole families over there. Families? I'll show you. Oh, before we get to them, the plane crash... Uh... Suzanne, lovely lady. Dead now. Little Mel, nine, came from England on a holiday, choked on a chicken wing. Ah, Frank. We're told he was quite a character. Cheers! To being fu- Yeah. Well, that sounds bad. Really does. We've been told that you got a big car. Yeah, and a big house. All to yourself. That's right. Halloween's my favorite holiday. Blood, death, mutilation... trick-or-treat, scaring people shitless. We were gonna kick it up the chicken shack like usual... but this is a special occasion, right? So, we wanna switch it up. We were thinking: big party, everybody getting drunk, wrecking things, throwing up, that type of shit. And we thought... you wouldn't mind if we used your place. Would I be invited? Maybe. We'll think about it. Well, that's fixed then. Saturday, at your place. I, I... I don't know. -Maybe. -Hey, we'll be your friends. Yeah, we'll be his friend. I don't need friends like you any more. Then, I'll be down on you like a buzzard on a gut wagon. I'll get it. How's your new friend? Mitch? He's fine, just fine. Well, we are dying to meet him. Yeah. And he would say the same, but... he's not very well right now. I thought he was fine? He's ill, but our friendship is fine. You owe me ten bucks. No, I need proof. Did you make a bet? -What was it about? -Nothing. Nothing important. I'm so pleased for you, Oliver. Friendship is a wonderful thing. Yeah, almost like having family. Almost? Well, it's everyone's dream, right? To have the perfect family, just like on TV. I love TV. I know you do. I know what you're gonna say, but this is nothing to do with us being friends. You gotta believe me. Just by you being here, you've saved my life. I'm happier now that at any time since my mother had her accident. You know, I've never had a family, Mitch, not a real one. My dad, he was always going away to work some place... and one day he just didn't come back. You know, after that, Mom got really sad. All day, she'd sit at home and watch the television and drink Martinis and... Every night I'd hear her crying on her own in her bedroom. Then she had her accident and they took her away. They even arrested Ron, my garden gnome. And the policeman said he was gonna get the electric chair and he thought that was funny, but I didn't. After that, they took me to a psychiatric hospital. Margot, the social worker, said I was too old to be adopted, so I stayed there until my birthday last month. That's when the judge said I could come back home. He said I'd be happy. But I wasn't. I was just all alone here. You know, ever since then, I tried to tell all of this to somebody... but nobody ever listened except you. And that's how I know you're my friend. Yeah. This is something I really have to do, Mitch. You understand, don't you? Hi. I'm Oliver. You're gonna be my new mother. Get well soon. Perfect. Ninja? You're a girl dog. Stay. Hey, hey, you think any of this stuff is gonna scare the customers? You kidding me? In a graveyard in the dead of night? All you gotta say is "boo" and they piss themselves. They see something like this. That should give them a heart attack. Hey, you nearly gave me a goddamn heart attack. You were like "boo"? And I was like "ah". Hey Doug, check out my evil laugh. -Hi, Elliot. -Hi, hi. Jesus... He looks like I feel, right? - Hey, Doug! Wait up. - Come on, buddy. It's Halloween. Well, not yet. Saturday mornings returning Robo-tastic, The hit comedy Robo-defenders is now an action-packed TV series starring your favorite action heroes... I hope you don't mind. It's supposed to be very good for the skin. You know, I wanted to take a photo of you guys, but... I know this one.

Now, I need you to go get some things for me... if you can fit that into your busy schedule. I made you up a list. Oh, and you can go get them as soon as your daddy's finished working on the car. - Dad's working on the car? - Mm-hm. And you should go give him a hand. Oh, and while you're there, tell him that his lunch is almost ready. Oh. Hi, sis. You look terrible. I bet you slept in your clothes again. I'm going to have a shower. Well, tell your friend, Mitch, to have one, too. He smells worse than Dad. Now, now children, no arguments. He was the one that was arguing. No, I was not. Well, you are now. Come on, you gotta go. Let's go. Thank you. There he is. What are you doing? What's it look like? I'm soaking up these glorious rays. You know, if you stay out here, you're gonna catch pneumonia. Yeah, yeah. And then, and then I might die. Aren't those my sunglasses? Yeah. I'm, uh, I'm borrowing them if that's alright? Turns out I need them more than you do. Ninja loves an eyelid. Here, good girl... Ninja! Come on, it's Oliver, your owner. There's a good doggy. Well trained, you see, goes straight for the throat. Come on, son. Help your father find something. Sure, Dad. What are you looking for? Now, don't tell your mother, but I lost three fingers in the transmission. Well, look at you. Mom told me to tell you that lunch is ready. Good, I'm starved. Come on, honey, punch. Come on. There you go, sweetie-pie. Oh, thanks honey. Now, can I fix you something to eat, Oliver? No, thank you. I'm not very hungry. Darling, is something wrong? I can't find it. Oliver and I looked everywhere. You silly Billy, did you check behind the seat cushions? Come on, do I look like an idiot? I'll check again, just in case. Please do. Don't lose your fingers. You're gonna take her on a date? -Yeah, yeah, yeah. -Okay. Who is that? Hey baby, where have you been hiding all my life? Prison. - I'm new. - I'm Kurt. -Hi. -Captain of the soccer team. Yeah, now that Mitch is dead. So, what do you say to us going on a date tonight? What makes you think that I wanna hang out with you? -Well, everybody does, huh? -Oh. I'm the most popular guy in Hubris. Hi. Hey. -Um... -You know the weirdo? -Hi. -What are you, what are you doing tonight? Uh, um... I thought maybe we could go out. -Out? -Yeah, on a date. Hi, I'm home. Huh, oh, can you please wipe your feet? I've just vacuumed in here. - Sorry. - I need a rest, darling. Oh, come on sweetie-pie. A little exercise never killed anybody. Hmm, did it? I don't know what you think you're doing sitting there, but you gotta go tidy your room, make your bed and take a shower before dinner. - But Mom... - Please, go. Please go. Thank you very much. Thank you, sweetheart. Off we go. Can you believe that? Are we switching? Count me in. I look fucking sensational. Do you have a comb? I think we should go out and party tonight. What do you reckon? I can't, Mitch. I'm sorry. I've got a date tonight with Chloe. Chloe? Who's Chloe? What's she like? Is she cute? She's terrifying. She got a sister? Strong. Weak. That's boring. Something else. It's better. Well, I've never been on a date before, so... -So? -What do I do? What do I say? -I just, I just... -Chill out, you're gonna be fine. I'll talk you through it. We'll start with the basics. Boys! Dinner's ready! Here we go. Now, later on, I thought that we should play a game of charades. Oh, no. I have to go out after dinner. Oh, well you can think again, young man. You're not going anywhere until you wash those dishes... - But Mom! - No arguments. Oh, guests first, darling. You don't wanna set a bad example to the children. -Sorry. -I'm actually all right. Thank you though. I haven't had much of an appetite these days. Why don't you just have one piece? You'll waste away. I met this guy once and the only thing he ate was cheese. Yeah, mostly, I think. I like my cheeses runny. Brie, ricotta, cottage cheese, Camembert, mozzarella,... ...Danish blue. Sweetie, I think,... I think you ate your pizza too fast. You know how being a greedy guts gives you indigestion. I'm sorry. Well, look at you. Nice work, kid. That deserves a drink. Cheers. That's my girl. So, who is she? The girl that you're going out with tonight? How did you know? I might be dead, Oliver, but I'm not stupid. She's just a girl I met last week. She's new in town. Stop it! Ninja! As long as you remember to be home before twelve. Come back here, you fucking mutt... Hey, hey, you do not use profanities in this house. I'm really sorry, Miss, it's just... she's got my arm. What? Oh my, oh my goodness. Come here. Come here. Bring it here. Oh goodness, I'm so sorry. Put that back on. - Thank you. - Come on. Let's go. Let's go. So, you, you were gonna tell me what I should do and say on, on this date. Okay. Just gimme a minute, 'cause I... I'm really worried, Mitch. Hey, hey, hey, it's okay. You have nothing to be worried about, all right? You're gonna have a great time. There's like three things that you need to remember. Firstly, take 'em somewhere with a nice view. Girls love a nice view. Dunno why. They just do. My mom and dad are always busy. They hardly ever talk. They never have fun together any more. Sometimes I think my family's going to pieces. I know just what you mean. Should we go somewhere else? I'm happy just... sitting here, sitting and talking. I've never really just... sat and talked before. Not even with your friends? No, I mean, I've never really had any real friends. Until tonight. I should be getting back. I can, I can drive you. You don't have to. It's, it's far. I can, I just call a cab from your house. Okay. Two. Always bring a wingman. You never know when you might need him. How'd it go? What are you doing? Hello. Well, I'm Mitch. Hi. Uh, I, I just need to call a cab. What? That'd be silly. Ollie could drive you. But I already offered. Okay. What? We insist, come on. You remember what happened last time. I do. What happened last time? And then the car's flipped over, smashed into a tree and the whole thing burst into flames. Wow. You're lucky to be alive. Yes. Yes, I am. Three. Meet the parents. How else you're gonna know what she'll look like in twenty years? - Thank you. - It's okay. You stay here, okay? Mom, this is Oliver, and that's Mitch in the car. Hello. Is he all right? Oliver saved his life. That was very nice of you. And thank you for bringing my daughter home. The pleasure was all mine. Thank you for a lovely evening. What a polite young man. Chloe, you should kiss him good night. Mom. It was nice to meet you, Oliver. I had... I had a great time tonight, really. You did that. You did that. Alf? Thanks for all your help, Mitch. I'm very grateful. I made it all up. Surprised it worked if I'm honest. Thank you. That boy, Oliver, is definitely up to something. He's making us look like fools. He's making you look like a fool, Julius. By the way, don't you owe me ten bucks? I didn't lose the bet yet. Today, I'm gonna prove that there's something very strange happening in that house. Yeah. Where have you been? Got some great stuff. You're gonna love it. Someone might've seen you. So? It's Halloween. You know this one? Can you give us a hand? I'm dying under here. You know, you could have been caught. What would you have done? Played dead. Oh, my god. It's Margot and Julius. -Okay? -I've forgotten all about them. Oh, oh, oh, you're messing my hair. If you're my friend, you're gonna help me. Now. Ollie, when have I ever let you down? No jokes about being dead, please. Hello, Oliver. Hi, Miss Seale, Mr. Carter. - Can we come in? - Uh, sure. This is Mitch, who I've been telling you about. Mitch, this is Miss Seale and Mr. Carter. Hello. Pleased to meet you, Mitch. Are you all right? Yeah. Oh, it's just a little accident. I'm fine. Uh, what happened? It was a car crash, um... the wheel of a plane hit my car and it flipped and the whole thing burst into flames and stuff was everywhere and Oliver... actually saved my life. He's the best friend I could ever ask for. Uh, first degree burns that I've got. That's so cool. -You can like, touch them. -Oh, no. I'm, I'm okay. -Honestly, please... -Would anyone like, uh, tea, coffee? I'll take a tea, Oliver. -They smell so cool, and they... -I'd rather not. You could even touch them. They're like... Who are you? And what do you think you're doing in my bathroom? I, I, I didn't know, um, I didn't know -anybody was here. -Don't just stand there, get out. Stupid little man. Did you meet my mother? Yeah, isn't it amazing? Mitch's parents are staying here while on vacation and it seems like Oliver's having a lot of fun. Tea and coffee's ready. We gotta go. 'Cause we got another meeting, right? And, uh... Yeah, sorry we didn't get to stay longer. Um, bye. I'll, I'll see you next week, then? You are very welcome. The bird feeder is fixed. Hmm, you're not wearing any make-up. So? You're letting yourself go, baby. Easiest money I've ever made. I found something in the house, Margot. Something horrible. What was it? Hey, baby. Frank, wake up. You do make me laugh. Right, breathe in deep. And... That hit the spot. I don't know, okay? But I'm gonna figure it out, and when I do, that kid's gonna spend the rest of his life... Would you listen to yourself, Julius? You sound like a crazy person. Two coffees. I know what you wrote in your report to the court... and I realize that your professional reputation... has taken quite a knock. But you have to accept the fact that you lost the bet. This is not about the bet. Okay. Well, accept the fact that Oliver... is not gonna be under your control at any time in the foreseeable future. Double or nothing? Oh, you're on. Let's go. I'm quitting tomorrow, I swear. When I was about fourteen, my father gave me a cigar,... told me to save it until the day I became a man. Of course I jumped the gun, went straight outside, smoked the whole thing. I threw up for two days straight. I think Alf's about to start. I can't miss that show. Sure you can. I'm gonna grab a beer. Two spots. Yeah, yeah. Okay. But Dad... what will I tell my mother about? Tell her about you. Trick-or-treat. Hey, Ollie, we're here. Trick-or-treat. Trick-or-treat. Sorry? It's tradition. You give us a treat, or we play a trick on you. What kind of trick? Well, think we'd have to trash the house, break some windows, and then... guess, beat you up. So, what kinda treat? We want cash. Say 300 bucks for starters. So, what's it to be weirdo, trick-or-treat? -Trick. - What the... I'm outta here, man. You guys are crazy, man. Hey. Who were those guys? It doesn't matter any more. You're not on your own, okay? Thanks, I think. - Hello? - Hi. Is that Chloe's mom? It is, yes. Please, call me Rachel. Hi, Rachel. This is Suzanne of Suzanne and Frank. We're looking after Oliver. Oliver? Oh yes, the lovely young man that took Chloe out the other night. Well, we're taking him to a Halloween party tonight. We would love for you all to join us. Halloween party? We don't get out as a family all too often, perhaps you and I could visit the hair salon in town together? Oh, we won't be here too much longer, I'm afraid. So, it'd be great if you could make it - to the party. - Sure. Why not? Eight o'clock then. No, that's, that's lovely, okay. Bye, bye-bye, bye, bye, bye. Chloe, honey? - What? - We're going out. Ugh. You better get yourself ready. We're going out for dinner. - Come on. - We are? Yes, we are. The undead always go out to eat on Halloween, and I already bought costumes for everyone. Frank. Frank! Wake up, baby, and put your arm back on. We are going out. Don't hurry, we'll get you some chicken. Watch out, life of the party coming through. ♪ Ghostbusters! ♪ I'm gonna have my work cut out tonight. - I like it here. - Love me a witch. Can I grab some food? - Oh, yes. Thank you. - Yeah.

Are, are you running a fever? Why are you putting it on me? What are you doing? Look back there! Don't worry, sir. You'll be perfectly all right with us. Lazy bones, lazy bones. Get out of bed, you sleepy head. Lazy bones, lazy bones. Leave me alone, I need to get more sleep. Oliver! Oh, dear. Why did you do that? Uh, what happened here? He hit me. She just fell off my bed. I want you two to make up. Come on, Oliver. -I'm sorry. -Hmm, now you, young lady. Sorry. Now, put your sister's head down. Now, we, we've left something for you on our bed, for your mother, from us. Hmm. Now, young lady, now, do you think we should put you back together again? Huh? Bet you didn't think of that one before you started fighting with your brother. Hi, Oliver! Oliver. Hey... I have some bad news about Julius. He was taken ill last night, and... it may be a long time before he gets better. I'm sorry to hear that. I'm filing a report today, so you won't be seeing much of us any more... ...but I'm always here if you need me, okay? Come on, I'll give you a ride. Take care of yourself, Oliver. Thanks for everything. Hi. I'm afraid there's no more stories from TV, Mom. I kinda stopped watching it. A lot of crazy stuff's been happening to me. Weird stuff... but good stuff. I don't know what's gonna happen in the end. Anyway, I'm not gonna tell you about any of that now. Today, I just came to say one thing. I miss you, Mom. I really miss you. My baby's better than yours. No, she's not. Your baby can't do this. Can she? Or this, and her hair's not long enough. Also, you can't spin it as fast as I can, watch. Need a hand, sweetie? I have everything under control, sugar-pie. That's disappointing. Oh, no. I'm coming, sweetie. What have you done? I followed the instructions. I don't think you did follow the instructions. Everything written on that piece of paper is right here. Hey, gimme a hand here. Mom. Dad. You gotta get outta here, son. This place is gonna fall apart any second now. Oliver! Mitch! You okay? I'm fine. I'm fine. We need to save Ollie. - My leg! - Oliver? - Can you get out? - It's stuck. - Okay, okay. - Don't worry, kid. We'll get it off. As soon as we lift it, you just run out the front door, okay? I just can't leave you here. We're dead, Ollie. And in a few minutes, you're gonna be leaving us. Oliver, Oliver, listen to me. You don't need us any more. I... I do. Look at us. You can see what's happening to us, but you, you got your whole life ahead of you. And if you don't save yourself now, then it would've all been for nothing. So do it, Oliver. Come on, Ollie. Come on, Ollie. Get the fuck out of here. Go. We all love you, Oliver. Even me. Love you, pal. Will I ever see you again? Not for a long time, I hope. But we'll be waiting for you, I promise. It's okay. Were you on your own?
