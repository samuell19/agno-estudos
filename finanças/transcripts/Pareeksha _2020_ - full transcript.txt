Good morning, Bunty! How you? What's How You? Its 'How are you?' -Okay. -You're so funny! Come on, Naveen. Let's go. Good morning, Naveen! Buchchi Express coming! If he doesn't want to go in the rickshaw send him by car. The driver doesn't come so early. They don't even run the school bus in this locality. Sir, since Moti Jheel is within 2 kms of the school... it doesn't operate here. But, don't worry. I've been taking children from this area to Sapphire since years. Buchchi, no song today? Sure! The English one? Yes! Baa baa black sheep, have you any water... This one, right? Baa baa black sheep went up the hill. Have you any water up the hill? - Good morning, ma'am! - Good morning... Good morning, D'souza madam. Namaste. Good morning, Buchchi. Only Subhash Kumar is absent. The rest are all here. Thank you, Buchchi. Four o'clock? I'll be on time. How's your son Bulbul? School... madam. Bulbul goes to school daily. But, it's a government school. The teachers are not regular. But Bulbul is very bright. But... he gets no opportunities. After all, it's no Sapphire. Announcement! Mr. Verma's wife is unwell. Join Shanti madam's class. But she just left. Yes. She has gone to pay her electricity bill. She'll be back soon. Hello, Mr. Studious, Bulbul Kumar! Didn't you hear? The class is cancelled! Let's go. Usman Uncle... Come. Careful. Stop... park it. Careful. The bag shouldn't tear. Put it on this. Here... get some chocolates. I'll take the chocolate another day, Usman-ji. Can I take this book instead? Here... You deserve the chocolates too. Bulbul, you're responsible for the book. You need to return it in the same condition. I promise. I'm leaving. You all have to do another half-shift. No one leaves. Radhika, you can't go... Boss's orders. The delivery has to be made tonight. I'm done for the day. My son returns from school at this time. He's no infant. Just for today. You'll get 25% extra overtime. He comes home hungry. If the delivery gets delayed, so will your payment. Don't complain later. What happened? The teacher didn't show up. We left early. And you needed to buy groceries. I came to help. Let's go. Pandey-ji, Natthu hasn't cleared last month's instalment. He's making excuses again. Seize the bloody defaulter's rickshaw. Got it, sir. The payment is ready Pandey-ji. But, it's an inauspicious time. Does this parking contract come for free? Does money fall from trees to finance your richshaw? Does the garage and its maintenance run on donations? Natthu, you've missed many deadlines. [Devotional song] Has he left? Without breakfast? Hasn't even taken his lunch. -Bulbul. -Yes, mother? See. You have a fever. It's nothing. Get me a tablet. It's time for me to go to the factory. You aren't going anywhere. I have to. If I don't go today, the supervisor will delay the entire week's payment. You're not going. Take the tablet and rest. Hey... Sir, his mother's unwell so he's here in her place... He's very smart. - He finished his work and... - And yours, too. No, sir... Why don't you join instead of your mother? I will pay you more! Why did you skip school? Don't get fired up! I had a fever. His teachers are often absent anyways... And what if they came today? Hasn't he missed the lesson? Is this why I break my back? So that you can be a factory worker? It's not his fault. I told him to... Shut up! If you didn't go for one day would it have caused an apocalypse? Get this in your head... You have to study. That's all. It's the only way out of this hell. I'll do anything to manage the money. But nothing must distract you! No matter what. Radhika, for the last time... Bulbul will never step into the factory again. -He will only... -Study! -Absolutely. -It's sorted, then. I won't ever ask him to lift a pin. Now, wash up and serve yourself the dinner... I have a terrible headache. Go to the chemist and get some balm. I'll massage it on her forehead. Bulbul won't go anywhere. He needs to study. Get to your books! Never mind. I'll go get it. Where's Buchchi going? Has he eaten? The fever's dropped. Did you speak to him? What is Natthu saying? He won't listen. He says that death is better than living like this... Namaste, madam. Bye. -Bye. -Bye. Pradeep. Pradeep. Your books will get spoiled. What're you doing? My exams are over. I don't need these books anymore. What about them now? These books are of no use now. They'll go in the trash! Bye. -How did the paper go? -Very well. Madam, can I take these books for Bulbul? He's in grade 9. He loves books. Sure... take them. Bye. -Pradeep, your bag. -Keep the bag. I'm going to Singapore in the holidays. I'll buy a new one from there. Thank you very much. From Bulbul, too. That's it? Nothing else for us? Of course... here. Take one more. Buchchi, the exams are over today. Yes, madam. School reopens on the 7th after a month. Bye. I know, madam. I'll be present on the 7th at 8:30 am sharp with the kids. -Goodbye, madam. -Goodbye. Sit quickly. Buchchi Express going fast. Bulbul. What's this? Look for yourself. Books. What's this? The kids were throwing them away so I brought them for Bulbul. I'm asking about this. This... is for me. I'll cut it up to make a shirt and trousers. Have you gambled again? And had a drink? No... Natthu forced me. I don't want it. Sorry, darling... It was... It's looking so nice. Fine... I'm double sorry. These books don't apply to me, father. Why not? Are they in English? ...very tough? They're from a different curriculum. What's that? They're central board physics and chemistry books. But that's real education. Sapphire children become Doctors, Engineers...officers By reading these books. I could, too. But I can't take the CBSE exam. Why not? You're a fast learner, son. You'll figure it out. That's not the point, father. My school follows the state board. These books are for an all India board. I'm not eligible to take these exams. But, don't worry. I will read them. Have you gone mad, Buchchi? Sapphire is very expensive. You're already working overtime to repay the loan on the rickshaw. Who will loan you such a big amount? You have connections at the bank, Pandey-ji. I've heard they give low interest loans for education. You're so naive. Ask Natthu. He went to the People's Co-operative bank. To get a loan of 55,000 rupees. What did the manager say? He said, "First get a guarantor, then we'll talk." It's great that your child goes to a school. This dream of sending him to Sapphire International is unreal. Bulbul is a bright student. He finishes a book a night. Government school education won't do him any good. All opportunities are lapped up by the Sapphire children. How will our children succeed? He can study CBSE only at Sapphire. What's CBSE? Real education. The key to unlock opportunities at an all India level. Right. If Bulbul learns English he can drive an electric rickshaw, too. What an idiot! How silly can you be? Electric rickshaw! He can do so much more. You won't ever understand. Buchchi, I salute your thinking. You have great foresight. But, it's impossible. Please stop. Greetings. Here. Come. You return so late these days. Bulbul has gone to sleep. This was stuck in the seat. I think it belongs to the last passenger. I dropped him in a lane behind Kalyani Square. I should return it. Be careful. -Thank you for coming. -I wouldn't miss your birthday. You're still here? Drop him near Shyam Talkies. And don't charge him the fare. He's my guest. -Please, let me pay. -I've taken care of it. Please sit. -Thank you. -I'll see you later. Rickshaw-wallah, start your chopper. It's more than 80,000! What do you think? Will the police be able to find the wallet's owner? If you couldn't identify the rightful owner, how will they? They'll just share it amongst themselves. -But... -No buts... Think of it as a gift from God. Something special... Buchchi Express... coming through! Watch out. Hold on. Come. Good morning! Good morning, D'souza madam. -Good morning, madam. -Good morning! -Good morning, madam. -Good morning! What's the matter, Buchchi? I just wanted to inquire... How does one get admission in Sapphire? There's an entrance exam. Then an interview with the child and parents. Only then does the committee decide. I thought it was enough to only pay the admission fee. That's a must. But one has to take the test. Who wants to know? Good morning! It's all there on the Sapphire International website. Good morning! I was asking for Bulbul, madam. In Sapphire? Why? Doesn't he study in the government school? He won't achieve anything there, madam. Sapphire is the only gateway to get ahead in life. That's true but... Bulbul... in Sapphire? How will you manage it? I've arranged everything, madam. An old debt has been recovered. I will pay the admission charge and the fee, too. If you admit Bulbul... it will be a huge favour. Please, madam. O.K. Come to the office at noon. Come... Madam. Come on boys, fast! They're all ex-students of this school. Madam. Children of eminent people. Sure. Today they're all successful. And in top positions. Some are globally known, too. Sir, don't worry at all. All facilities for students are available on the school campus. Thank you so much. You've put us at ease by admitting our son. Please come to Singapore with your family as our guest. So kind of you, Mr. Singh. Don't worry about your son. Don't worry at all. -Thank you so much! -Please, come. Buchchi, I've spoken to the Registrar. He refused. Sorry... your son cannot be admitted here. Please don't say that, madam. If you don't give us a chance how will we ever succeed? Oh. So, this is Mr. Rickshaw-wallah. I've informed him, sir. I'm very happy that your son goes to school... and you want him to progress in life. Truly a wonderful thing. But the school where he goes is perfect for him. He won't be able to adjust in Sapphire. A boy from the slums will be a misfit here. Bulbul is a dedicated student, sir. We don't let him do any household chores. Please explain to him... it's impossible. Sir. Madam, please get me to meet the Principal. Just once. That's not possible, Buchchi. The Principal's very busy. And now that sir has refused, nothing can be done. -Madam... -Please. What time does the Principal leave for the day? 5pm sharp. Do you have the Sapphire school uniform? Sure... what size do you want? My son is 14 years. About this tall. Does this size work? This should fit. But do you have this in full sleeves? The Battle of Haldighati holds great importance. On 18th June, 1576, Maharana Pratap fought Akbar's army. The Mughal monarch held Man Singh... My son Bulbul... it's very urgent... Sorry, sir. Come on. Let's go, Bulbul. Father, there's a class going on! Hurry ... she leaves at 5pm sharp. -But, my class... -Now! Get up. Sorry, sir. Let's go. Man Singh said... Why is this child standing in the rain? Why hasn't he gone home yet? He's the rickshaw-wallah, madam. He drives the children to school. Why hasn't he taken this child home? His parents must be worried sick. What's your name? Which class are you in? Good evening, madam. My name is Bulbul Kumar and he's my father. Bulbul? He's my son, madam. I am Buchchi Paswan. A rickshaw-wallah. I've been bringing children... to Sapphire school everyday for the last seven years. I love the school. It's a great school, madam. Every student here gets many opportunities... Please give my Bulbul a chance, too. A government school will take him nowhere. Finally, he will end up as a rickshaw-wallah. Please help him out of this hell. Test him on any subject. Interview him thoroughly. My son is very bright. He's a class topper. How can I grant him admission? What do you know about this school? About the students here? I know, madam. I've seen the wall of fame in your school. All highly accomplished in life. My Bulbul's photo will also occupy a prime spot there, madam. Just one chance, madam. Alright. Bring him tomorrow. I will. Come on... thank her. What is the difference between metals and non-metals? Sir... You prefer Hindi? What is the difference between metals and non-metals? Sir, metals have free electrons which are absent in non-metals. That's why metals are good conductors. At which point do the Fahrenheit and Celsius scale coincide? Minus 40 degrees. Define 'Force'. Force can be defined as push or pull. And it's unit of measurement? Newton. Do you know about prime numbers? Yes, sir. What is the largest prime number? Sir, a prime number can be infinite. Who was India's first President? Sir, Dr. Rajendra Prasad. When did the French Revolution take place? Sir, 1789 to 1799. What was the motto of the French Revolution? Liberty, Equality, Fraternity. Where will the Summer Olympics 2020 be held? Tokyo, Japan. How will you calculate the volume of water in this glass? Sir, by multiplying the height of the water by Pi r square. Madam. Come. But we're uneducated... What will we say? Don't worry. They won't ask you academic questions. Come. Come on. How many children do you have? Bulbul Kumar is our only child. What do you do? Buffing at a utensil factory. An eight-hour shift every day. But Bulbul doesn't do any other work. He only studies. Has Bulbul ever taken any coaching or tuitions? No, he says he doesn't need it. He studies on his own. Shambhu, Zeba, Ratan, Muniya, Suraj, Kaliya... he teaches all the kids in our slum. Do you know about the school fee and other expenses? Yes, we've arranged everything. Fee, uniforms, books... admission fee... it's all arranged. We won't default on anything. Madam, he's a rickshaw-wallah's son... from the slums. His mother is a mere labourer. At a utensil factory. How can you... What's wrong with that? They work very hard. And the child is brilliant and well-behaved. Are you confident that he'll perform well? Ma'am, this boy will make it to the merit list. Over half the money has been spent on the fee, uniforms and books. How will we manage the expenses here on? Did you say something? No. Let us go. We'll get late. Come on, son. That'll do. Okay. Let's leave. I'll carry it. Congratulations, Bulbul. I'll keep you in my prayers. Come on. Usman-ji, you sell used books in spite of being a graduate. Let's see what your disciple can achieve. God bless your words, Babu. I managed with a government school education. I was a good student but lacked opportunities. Maybe I should've tried harder. But, pray for Bulbul. The whole world is open to him now! But I can't understand, Rahman. How did this miracle happen? Bulbul is a very bright student. He cleared the tests at Sapphire. My Sonu is capable, too. But one should dream within his means. Bulbul, sit on the stool. Buchchi, your son? Yes. My son! Is he a rickshaw-wallah, too? Here, Hrithik. No... He is a Sapphire boy! I pedal the rickshaw... he will study. Son, sit down here. Are you okay, son? Welcome, Bulbul! Welcome to Sapphire International School. Thank you, madam. Wait a minute. Good morning. I will walk you inside. I'll take you to your class and show you around... Good morning, madam. Good morning! Shall we go? -Let's go. -Bye, father. Bye. So, you're new to the class. Will you please stand up and introduce yourself? Sir, my name... I asked you to stand up, please. -Sir, my name... -Louder, please! My name... Sir Bulbul Kumar. So we have a student conferred with knighthood right here in the class. Honoured to have you, sir! So, where were we with Samuel Taylor Coleridge? Day after day... day after day, We stuck, nor breath nor motion As idle as a painted ship Upon a painted ocean. Water, water, everywhere, Not a drop to drink. Why has the management decided to take you in this class... ...in the middle of the term? Your board exams are coming up in a few months. You haven't even read the English books prescribed for CBSE course. And your grammar is poor to say the least. What on Earth is wrong with the management! What's this? English to Hindi diction... It's a dictionary. Hey Pradeep, isn't this your bag? Yes. I threw it. His dad took it. But, it's okay. Bro, is it true that your dad is a rickshaw-wallah? Yes. He brings us to school everyday. So, how did you come here? I mean, why Sapphire? Why Sapphire? Father says that this is the road to success. The way out of hell. Wow! I read the news that a driver's son cleared the medical exams. -He must have come through a quota. -What will you do? Engineering? MBA? They can keep dreaming. Are only you allowed to dream? Go ahead, bro. Dream on. Don't forget to wake up on time. Which 'father' said these wise words? Father of the Nation? Oh no! His father. The rickshaw-wallah. No one is nice to me. What did you think? They'll welcome you with open arms? They'll shower you with petals? Seat you on a throne? Look at our status. Why would they mingle with you? We live in the slums. Your father has seen a mad dream and overcoming obstacles, created this opportunity for you. Be brave. Show them your mettle. Learn English with us. This app will help you learn English. What about my wages for the extra hours? "The dog barked at the rich man" "He left his shoes and ran" What's the matter Buchchi? Working late? Are you looking to make extra cash? What would I go home and do? I thought I could do a few more trips. You're always so eager to meet your son. Sometimes, you even leave before time. Hello. I will take 2-3 hours more. How much is it? After pooling in everything, we're still 3000 short. Tomorrow is the last day to pay the fees. I almost had it. Missed by one number. It would've taken care of everything. Even next month. How many times have I told you not to gamble? You'll lose it all! Sorry. I'll figure something tomorrow. I've made arrangements. I've asked for an advance at the factory. You're already working extra hours to pay off the previous advance. Look at your hands. Your skin's peeling. Don't borrow more. The CBSE national exam is only two months away. All teachers praise Bulbul. Bulbul is so good, after all. Bye, mummy. Come along. Come. Here you go. Hey! Who's that sitting on the seat? The seat was empty... it was a mistake. He always sits on the stool. The Sapphire uniform has gone to your head. Have you forgotten who you are, rickshaw-wallah? -Please forgive me. -Get off, Naveen. You're not riding in this to school. Please forgive me. My child made a blunder. -Sit down here. -Father, go on. I'll walk to school. No, son. Sit down here... not on the seat. I'll reach before Buchchi Express... through a shortcut! Son... Please sit here, son. I'm really sorry. You guys are a menace. Sorry, sir. -Make sure you collect from him. -Yes, sir. Why are you so upset, Buchchi? And you're defaulting on my payments, too. It was the last day to deposit Bulbul's fees. I'll pay you daily from now on. Right. Be sure not to default anymore. Pandey-ji, the computer is worth more than 20,000 rupees. Natua, why don't you sell it for 50,000 to someone else? Pandey-ji. -Hey, Natua. -Yes? Can you arrange for a cycle? Sure. But what kind? There are several lying outside the police dumpyard. Wow Bulbul, a new cycle? Yes. Father bought it for me. It will save him time. How much did you get it for? It's in great condition. Bye, father. Bye, son. Be careful. I got it off a second hand dealer. See you, Usman-ji... Zeba. X is equal to 15. Very good. Good. Sir, I can solve it using another method, as well. Really? Continue... Solution two, we will use the elimination method. We will multiply this by three. Alright, Bulbul. It's a deal. We'll help you with English and you help us with physics, chemistry and math. What rubbish! That's not fair! Three subjects in exchange for one? It's a deal, Pandey-ji. Namaste, sir. The fees... This form is for guardians. Take a look. What is this, sir? The school has arranged additional coaching for the exam. All 10th graders are taking it. What do I need to do? It's a six-week intensive course. 40,000 rupees for all subjects. 40,000! Does Bulbul also have to take it? You decide. It's not compulsory but all the children are taking it. These exam results can make or break a child's life. Alright, sir. Moti Jheel? Yes, please sit. Let's go. The Income Tax guys could have been handled. But, the Vigilance Department was there, too. At our house, too. All the cash was hidden in the bedroom mattress. God knows how they sniffed it out. They took every penny... Festival shopping seems tough now. I had promised my son a Christmas holiday to Bangkok. All cancelled now. We've reached the temple. Can you wait? It's Thursday. Special prayers are going on. And waiting charges? We'll pay extra. We won't be long. Please keep an eye on our bags. Bless me. Come. Sit. You have too many enemies. The Goddess will destroy them. She is our only hope. Everything will be okay. Keep faith in her. -I'm feeling much better now. -I feel calm. Where's the rickshaw? It was right here. He must be around somewhere. Where did he go? There was a rickshaw here. Have you seen it? -It was right here. -I haven't seen it. Oh no! Oh Lord! How much will You test us? That's all we needed! The stuff was worth over 75,000. File a complaint with the police. Please shut up! Don't even think about a police complaint. I'm already struggling to explain the source of the cash. What did he say? What a catch, Buchchi! More than 50 percent of this stuff will get used at my home... In fact, my wife's festival shopping is done. Keep it. Bulbul, why aren't you ready? It's a holiday today. But Bulbul has extra classes. Don't be late. Hurry up. Father I've informed school that I would study on my own. I don't need tutoring. What do you mean? You'll fall back in class. I've already submitted the form. Father, that's not enough. I've paid the fees as well. 50 percent... for now. I've spoken to the accountant. I'll pay the balance by next week. Father... - What? - I'll manage. There's no need to. Please leave. Move. What is it? I borrowed the money from Pandey-ji. This extra help is very important. Didn't we discuss it? This is the last time. It's the CBSE final exams. Our efforts will be wasted if the final results aren't good. Is one lifetime enough to repay the loan? I'll do whatever it takes. I'll pedal even on an empty stomach. Work a triple shift. There will be no compromise with Bulbul's studies. He's competing with much privileged students. He can't fall behind. He has to top his class. It's non-negotiable. I'm leaving. [Announcements] Hurry up! The bus is about to leave. Move. [Devotional song] Everybody takes the tutoring. But you have to go the extra mile to ensure a good result. It will cost you. But I have a solution. I have contacts at all the examination centres. After all, Bulbul's life journey depends on the result of this exam. Thank you. You'll get the money this evening. Sir... you dropped something. It's for you. No, sir. It's yours. Keep it. Sir, your paper. -I needed a little more time. -Never mind. English is over... what's next? History. He's totally preapared for it. Hey, Bulbul. What happened? Didn't the exam go well? It was fine. He did well. Why are you looking so worried? I had made an arrangement. But you... That was you? Yes. Since your English is slightly weak. Bulbul. What happened? That's what I want to know. I spent so much... For me to cheat? Who asked you to do it? The accountant said it was common. Plus, your English is weak. Does that mean I should cheat? If I'd been caught it would be over for me. That wouldn't have happened. They run a system. It is guaranteed... Even then, I could never cheat, father. Don't you understand? I don't want undeserved grades! [Devotional song] What's wrong with you? Are you free? Come, please sit. Should we take one more rickshaw? I don't think, we'll fit. It's alright. Please move a little. We'll manage. Come on... sit. Buchchi. Come sit. Come on... sit down. Sit next to me. How long can I wait for my payment? Even that 'side business' has vanished. What's on your mind? Nothing, Pandey-ji. It's Bulbul's final exam. Everything gets spent on him. There are a many expenses apart from the basic fee. Just sitting around isn't going to solve anything, right? You have to do something. Go to sleep. Give the books some rest, too. I'll wake you up at 4am. If you study in the morning with a fresh mind... you'll remember everything. I've memorized everything, ma. I was just revising. Father hasn't returned yet? He's been working late these days. He should be home soon. There's a rickshaw. Stop him! Hey, rickshaw-wallah. Please stop. We'll miss our train. Sorry, I'm getting late. We've made holiday bookings. Please drop us to the station. Give it to me. Hurry and lock up. I'm doing that! Let me help. Hold this. -Have you locked up? -Yes. Let's go. All done. Let's go. Are you comfortable? Hurry, let's go. Kailash. Son, did you miss the train? Who is it? I heard a noise. Thief! -Thief. -Who is it? Thief! -Help! Somebody... -Be careful. Somebody please help! Leave him! Thief. Somebody catch him. Thrash him! Thrash the thief! Why don't you speak, rascal? Cat got your tongue? Unbelievable! The bloody fellow won't even say his name. Go on. Inform sir. Sir! Seems like an old-timer. Refuses to say a word. Get him to confess. He has terrorised the neighbourhood. This is the fourth case in the last seven months. If you can't get him to talk, hand him over to us. We will get him singing in a few minutes. We'll call you if needed, Give us a chance. Please go. Leave the rest to us. -Please do something, sir. -You must fix this, sir. Rest assured. Hasn't father come home yet? Case number 347/18. Bring the accused named 'Unknown'. What's the name of the accused? Sir, the accused is unable to tell us his name or address. We're unable to identify his fingerprints either. Please grant us police custody for 14 days for further investigation. Granted. He's left his phone in the rickshaw. Don't worry. I'll look for him. I'll go to every police station. He has never disappeared like this. -I hope nothing... -Maybe... Babu, don't think negatively. We don't know how he managed so much money for Bulbul. Maybe he was involved in something illegal? You've seen our records of the past three days, Pandey-ji. We don't have any dead body that matches this photo. There's one fellow but he's as good as a mute. We've tried everything but he hasn't uttered a word. He hasn't spoken a single word, Pandey-ji. What do you think? No. -He's not my man. -Sir, the boss is calling you. I'll be right back, Pandey. You've done the right thing by staying mum. Don't say a word about our arrangement, under any circumstance. I'll watch out for your wife and Bulbul. Radhika is very worried. Do you want me to tell her? I understand. I'll keep quiet as well. It's largely a residential area, sir. Mostly routine cases. There are 24 history-sheeters. With updated last known locations. What's the investigation status of current cases? All online, sir. And what about that female student kidnapping from Shastri Nagar? Two teams were already on the case. We've got a fresh lead today. The investigation is ongoing, sir. Who's this? 347/18. Identity â??unknown'. We've tried everything sir. He won't say a word. There's no prior record either. Get him. Sir. Sit. Don't be afraid. Sit. Do you want some tea? What's your name? They won't hurt you. Tell me. Where do you live? Why aren't you speaking? Did you find anything on him? Yes, sir. Bring the envelope. Sir, there was some money and bits of paper in his pocket. No identification sir. Who is Bulbul Kumar? Very exceptional child. His father is an uneducated rickshaw-wallah... but Bulbul tops his class. We have high hopes from him for the upcoming exams. Can I meet Bulbul Kumar? Grade 10 children are either studying on their own or being tutored privately. We're not holding regular classes for them. I need his address. Sure. By the way, Bulbul's father hasn't been coming for a few weeks. We've had to make alternate arrangements to bring the children to school. Sir, this is Bulbul's mother. Where's Bulbul Kumar's father? I don't know, sir. It has been eight days... he hasn't returned from work. Has he ever disappeared like this before? Never, sir. Sometimes he would get late but... would eventually return home. God knows where he has gone. We've looked in hospitals, police stations... everywhere. Don't worry. We'll find him. Where's Bulbul? He's here, sir. He's very worried, too. He couldn't join private tutoring. He's managing on his own. P from Prasad and... H from Har Har.. So Sin is P upon H... Bulbul, they're here to look for your father. What's the chemical formula of water? H2O. And salt? NaCl. Sugar? C12-H22-O11. Tell me the trigonometric identity of Sin Alpha plus Sin Beta. Tell me the trigonometric identity of Sin Alpha plus Sin Beta. Go on... I will answer all your questions, sir. But, please find my father. I will. Sin Alpha... plus Sin Beta... is equal to two Sin... Alpha plus Beta... upon two... into Cos... Alpha minus Beta upon two... Stop worrying about your father. I will find him. Focus on your studies. There isn't much time left for your CBSE exams. Hey come! Go out, everyone. Come here. Sit. Ambedkar Nagar slums. That's where your son Bulbul Kumar and wife Radhika live, right? Why did you steal? And why are you hiding it? Sir, I made a mistake, sir. Sit. It's all my fault, sir. I destroyed everything. He used to study in a government school. I saw an impossible dream, sir. To make him study in a CBSE school. We didn't have the money. We were crushed under debt. I've destroyed my son's life. If Bulbul gets to know he will never forgive me, sir. Before he finds out, hang me. Give me some poison. Here, have a glass of water. You did it for your son. But it's still wrong. It's not that only children from private schools do well. Those who study in government schools and take state exams also do well. And even become successful people. But they lack opportunity, sir. Usman-ji is a graduate but that didn't help. He sells second-hand books, sir. Maybe he didn't find the right guidance. Look at me. I studied in a government school in my village. Sir... Even though you did it for your child... it's wrong. Even if I request the court to show leniency... you'll still be punished. I know, sir. I am ready for any punishment. But Bulbul shouldn't know till his exams, sir. I will bear any punishment. I will pay the price for my mistake. But, he shouldn't know. He shouldn't be punished for my mistake. -Ambedkar Nagar slums. -Sir. To determine the current in every branch of the network... we use Kirchhoff's rules. In order to reduce the number of unknowns... -Kirchhoff's first rule. -Correct. Now, we have three unknowns. i1, i2 and i3. We can apply Kirchhoff's second rule to the three different closed loops. Correct... try it. What are you doing? The measurement unit of the optical power of a lens... or curved mirror is Diopter. Power of lens, P is equal to 1 upon focal length. And the focal length is measured in meters. Convert the centimeters to meter and try to solve it. This method. W-A-T-E-R... water. and T-E-A... tea break. Very good! Sir, what time will the Superintendent of Police stop? The SP is the boss. I can't say anything for sure. Hello. I've never seen anything like this. What a strange man! He taught the kids till 2am? Why is he doing this? What does he want? The whole neighbourhood is stunned, Mr. Legislator. Children line up early in the evening with their books. Waiting for the SP to arrive. Sir, the SP was a topper in physics from Delhi University. A gold-medalist. The length of the train will be determined... by the distance it covered in 9 seconds. The speed of the train is 60 kilometers per hour. Now, let's convert this to meter per second. How will we do that? Stop the media. Go! Stop. Everybody, please. Mr. KK, please tell them to stop. -Namaste, sir. -Namaste. What are you doing, sir? Me? You're the one doing this wonderful public service. Sir, don't you think it should be publicised? Sir... it's nothing special. Just some kids I'm trying to help. Some help? Sir, you're doing such a great thing! But, why enjoy the goodwill just by yourself? How about sharing it with me? Come, let's talk. Come. All the credit is yours, sir. I will tell the media that I was inspired by you to teach them. But that's only if they perform well in the exams. If all this appears in the papers now... they'll be distracted by the publicity. It's my humble request. Let the results get announced and then you can have a grand function. I see your point. Fine. I don't understand, sir. The SP goes personally to the slums to find a missing person. Not only that he also teaches the kids there. If I print this story, people will think the news is fake. Don't bother. Have a cup of tea. You're not sharing the full story with me. There is none. Sir goes there to help. He has a kind nature. Was the SP asking anything specific? What's the matter, Pandey-ji? Was he asking about Buchchi? No. He just said not to worry. That they would find him. I'm sure he will keep his word. If the cops ask for too many details, give me a call. Pandey-ji. Do you have some new information? No. If I learn anything... If you know anything... please tell me. The anxiety is killing me. Bulbul's father held you in high regard. You know everything. If he's done anything wrong... we'll make good. No matter what it takes. I just want him to come back home. He'll be back. Sooner or later. We're all trying, aren't we? Sir, the Ambedkar Nagar charge-sheet is ready. File it as 'Name - Unknown'. All your answers are correct. Full marks! The preliminary exams went well. Start preparing for the finals. Well done. Bring out your chemistry books. The finals are in four weeks. We have to keep up the momentum. You have most certainly made a mark. Well done! He has scored hightest in the class in all subjects except English. What an intelligent son the rickshaw-wallah has. Don't you know? They're getting tutored by the super cop, SP Kailash Anand. He teaches in the slums every night. Our Superintendent of Police? Yes. He was a gold-medalist. Topper in science. No wonder. That's why the rickshaw-wallah's son has topped. Namaste, sir. -Namaste. -Namaste. Please sit. You've never come to my humble abode. But I'm a public servant. I had to come. Fantastic, sir! Congratulations on Bulbul Kumar's result. We had no idea that there's so much talent hidden behind this uniform. If your magic can make these poor slum children shine, just imagine... our children will touch the skies. With a little support from you. This is Mr. Raj Kumar Shah. He's willing to make the entire conference hall... of his commercial building available. Hundreds of students can be accommodated there. It's fully air-conditioned with a generator as back up. Whenever the Minister visits... he conducts all his political meetings there. And you'll be spared from going into that dirty slum. The slum children can come there too. Thank you. But perhaps you forget that I'm the Superintendent of Police. Law and order is my prime responsibility. It is in my personal time that I help the children. They have no resources. You have the means. Every resource is at your disposal. You can pay for good full-time teachers and tutors. I can't even give these kids sufficient time. No matter how late I get, they turn up to study. It's just a matter of a couple of months, sir. And you don't have to teach for free. We'll be happy to compensate you in other ways, if you prefer. Are you proposing that I step out of the uniform... and become a professional tutor? How much can you pay? Do you equate everything to money? Bulbul Kumar and the others from the slum... don't do well because of me. But because of their hunger to succeed and their hard work. I just show them the way and they shine. Your children have the ability but not the hunger. I don't have a problem teaching anybody. Anyone can come to Ambedkar Nagar. But on my time. When I get free from my formal duties. Like the kids who wait odd hours for me. So you reject our appeal for the better future of our kids? You misunderstand me. Sir, I understand perfectly well. Sorry for wasting your time. This guy is out to divide the people. He's causing a rift amongst our supporters. People are living in terror. Sir, if this officer stays, I cannot guarantee success in the elections. Fine. Please get him transferred quickly. Consider it done. Sir, this... Case number 347/18. Bring the accused named 'Unknown'. The identity of the accused has been found. Please inform. His name is Buchchi Paswan. Sir, after the investigation, his identity is now known The police has requested that his name be changed in the warrant to Buchchi Paswan. Take this on record. In light of the facts, occurrence and absence of a prior criminal record of the accused... and as per law, the accused, Buchchi Paswan under sections 380, 457 and 511 of the IPC is hereby sentenced to... three years imprisonment and a fine of 5,000 rupees. All the sentences are to be carried out simultaneously. Case number 522/16. Bring the accused Santosh Mandal. Buchchi, I've told your son everything. -It was necessary. -I understand. -It's not easy for Bulbul. -I know. But, he understands. You've done a lot for me, sir. This was my destiny. Your true test lies ahead. But be strong. I made a mistake, my son. A big mistake. A huge one. I destroyed everything. Isn't Buchchi Paswan your husband? Since when do you know about his dealings? No one knew anything. My crimes were mine alone. Come on. Move. Get in. It'll be okay. Study. He made a mistake. But your father isn't a bad person. You don't need to be ashamed of anything. Look... "The Rickshaw-wallah Thief and His Topper Son". What else can one expect from a slum-dog thief's son? Son of a thief must've cheated his way to the top. Cancel his candidature, madam. What about our children? Should they share their exam hall with a crook's son? You've broken our trust by giving him admission. Our reputation is ruined. We've told the management... to correct their mistake. Such anti-social elements cannot be allowed to prosper in society. Bulbul Kumar should not be allowed to take the CBSE exam. What's your name? Alright, go in. What have I done? I've ruined everything. I'm not even worthy of forgiveness. The exams are in three days. And they refuse to let him take the CBSE exam. Not even the State exam. We didn't fill the form for it. What will we do now? It's all my fault. What a blunder I've made. That's enough, father. Stop cursing yourself. You made a mistake. You stole. You owned up to it. And now you're being punished for it. But you did all this for me. To give me an opportunity to a better life. Since my childhood you've only thought about me. Gathering books for me to study... even though you couldn't read. Everything I am is because of both of you. No matter what the world says... there cannot be a greater father than you. Your meeting time is up. Come one. Son... my son. Bulbul Kumar's destiny is being decided in the board meeting of... Sapphire International School. Since his father has been jailed for theft, the pressure has increased on... the school management to cancel Bulbul Kumar's candidacy. You don't understand. Bulbul hasn't just topped his class... he has also inspired other children. The overall class performance has improved. Madam, you have the decision of the board. Bulbul Kumar's father should've thought of the consequences... before committing crime. We have a chance to correct the mistake we made... of admitting him in this school. We can save the reputation of this great institution. By cancelling his candidacy. It is very important to send out the message that our school... does not support criminals. Cancel it! Who all will we respond to? Madam, there's no need to bring him in and talk to him. Just convey the board's decision... I'm really sorry to say, Bulbul. The school board's decision is against you. They do not want to allow you to take the exam. Is it because my father is a thief? Of course. And it has been proved in court. He is serving his sentence for his crime. But what am I being punished for? Your education has been funded with stolen money. And that's a crime. But, sir... I've never been dishonest with my studies. I've prepared for every exam with honest effort and hard work. And taken each exam with utmost faithfulness. You can check with any of my teachers. And sir... please think about why my father had to steal. He worked day and night. My mother's hands would be bloodied from long hours at the factory. Even then it wasn't enough to cover the fee and other expenses. So... he stole. He was helpless. Please don't deny me this exam. This is a great institution. It's given me so much. Every opportunity. I've learnt to make the most of it here. Now, it's my turn to do something for the school. Sir... I always top my class. I will bring honour and glory to our school. Please do not take this exam away from me. Go on. Prepare for the exam! No one can stop you now. Not even this exam. -Congratulations! -Thank you, madam! Congratulations, to all of you! Thank you, ma'am. Here. My son came first, sir. Take some sweets. Take some sweets. Congratulations. Here, take one more. Give me that. I'll distribute them inside. -Bye, son. -Bye, father. Bye, father. Congratulations! Great news. -Congratulations! -Thank you. Very good. Please have one. -Congratulations. -Here, please have one. -Here. -Your son has done so well. Congratulations! All God's grace. -Here, please take. -We're happy for you. One more... Come... get some sweets. Congratulations. Have some sweets. Congratulations, Buchchi. Some sweets. I have more. Congratulations, Buchchi.
