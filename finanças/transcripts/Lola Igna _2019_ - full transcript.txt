Good morning, Carias. I made your favorite, water spinach adobo. Hold on. I forgot to give you your liquor. Cheers! Come on, let’s eat. This is delicious! Get away! Damn these flies! Hey, do you think my food is rotten? Like shit? There are way too many flies. I don’t know what has happened to this town. Good for you, you’re dead. Have a safe journey. Grandma Igna! Grandma Igna! Grandma! Grandma, why aren’t you dressed yet? What’s the occasion? I already told you the other day, we are going to the Mayor’s office. Come on, I’ll help you get dressed. Is this yours, Grandma? That’s Ana’s. She gave that to me before she left. Here, wear this. I’ll only wear that on a special occasion, Nida. Today’s a special occasion. You will be awarded the title of the oldest living grandmother in the Philippines! Damn! They're going to give me a prize for being old? How about those people who grew old but didn’t really learn anything? You're all nonsense. Grandma, come on, please wear this already! We’re going to be late. Not this one, something else. I want you to dress me with this during my wake. What wake?! Nida, I’ve already prepared for my impending death. You don’t have to spend anything. Not a single dime. Here, wear this instead. You look so beautiful, Grandma. Damn! Looks like I’m ready for my funeral! Grandma! Let’s go, Grandma? Oh my, It's very, very cold here! And how can Grandma Igna snatch this title from her? We found out that Letricia Yavavoshka of Ukraine But, our Grandma Igna is older than her by six months. That's why we will gather all the documents to prove that Grandma Igna is older than Letricia. Is there prize money involved? Grandma Igna will receive $50,000 a year. Wow! So that’s a total of $5.9 US Million Dollars. That’s a huge amount! If that happens, Grandma Igna will become an old millionaire. My question is, can she still hear us? Yes, I can hear you loud and clear! I’m sorry, Grandma. What’s your secret to a long life? Secret? I have no secrets. Place the mic near your mouth. I just eat fresh vegetables like water spinach and sweet potato leaves. I also breathe in fresh air all the time. And sometimes, I also drink coconut wine. Grandma is such a comedian. Are there any more questions? Yes? To Grandma Igna, in all your years here on Earth, is there anything that you want to do but have not done yet? Go ahead. What’s the question again? It’s too long. Grandma, what is it that you want to happen that hasn’t happened to you yet? The one event that I look forward to happening, that hasn’t happened until now, is my death. is my death. I want to die already. What’s wrong with what I said? Grandma is always joking, isn’t she? But I’m not joking. But we won’t let that happen. We have to keep Grandma Igna alive and kicking. So we have to keep Grandma Igna healthy and alive. Long live Grandma Igna! Long live! I’m good. I got everything. Grandma. Can I pee? Grandma, you’re embarrassing us! What did I say wrong? Just pee later. Grandma! Look here! -Smile, Grandma. -One more! Grandma! Grandma! Oh my God! That’s embarrassing! Poor old woman! We are here right now at the place of the oldest living grandmother in the Philippines. Grandma Igna, can we have an interview with you? Get out! Serves you right! Get out of here! Grandma doesn’t want to be interviewed. She’s camera shy. Despite the rainy weather, crowds of tourists from different parts of the country come here just to get a glimpse of Grandma Igna, the oldest living grandmother in the Philippines. After we sow the rice fields, all we do is wait for harvest time. We make extra income from the tourists who come here to see Grandma Igna. -One bag of chips please. -We sell bottled water and soda to earn extra cash for our family. Me? Oh, no. I'm shy and not used to it. It's all right. Quick question, why did you think of selling Grandma Igna merchandise? Well, we're still selling pesticides and fertilizers, but the shop is quite big, right? So we thought of selling Grandma Igna souvenirs. The truth is, Grandma Igna’s granddaughter, Nida, is the one who came up with it. And with God's grace, our revenue tripled. Oh, that's good! Thank you very much. Thank you very much too. How much is this shirt? -300. -Do you have a medium size? -Medium? -Yes Hang on, I'll check if we have it in stock. All right, thank you. My grandmother is really famous. She has her own branded t-shirts, coffee mugs, and wallets. And some fridge magnets. -Cool! -Hey, that’s not allowed! Boy! Can’t you read the sign? But I’m a customer. I’ll buy this, this, and this! Even if you buy, it's still not allowed. But I'm going to buy anyway. Even so. Fine! I’ll go buy somewhere else. Go ahead! -What a grumpy one! -What did you say? Nothing. Miss, go buy somewhere else. Her crankiness might rub off on you! Rude! Grinch! This is 35 pesos. This is 75 pesos. Just pick whatever you want. -This is only 35 pesos? -Yes. Three for one hundred pesos. This is 75 pesos. This is 100 pesos. -Excuse me. -Yes? Do you sell Grandma Igna shirts? Go over there, boy. You don’t have Grandma Igna shirts? I’m sorry, we don’t. Grandma Igna and her husband Carias lived here. They had two children, but only one survived. That’s my grandmother. I’m Grandma Igna’s great-great grandchild. Really? But how do you all fit inside? Can everyone cram inside, Or does Grandma Igna live alone? We have a house over there. Grandma Igna lives here by herself. She doesn’t want to leave this house, because it is the only remaining memory she has of Grandpa Carias. -How sweet of Grandma Igna! -Sweet! Does your family also own that piece of land? Everything you see from here all the way to there. All the way there? That’s not ours. You’re so funny! Isn’t he funny? When Grandpa was still alive, we used to own this land. -But Grandma Igna had to sell it -What’s that noise? to pay for Grandpa’s hospital bills. This house is the only thing she didn’t sell. -What does Grandma Igna do every day? -What are these pests doing here? Yeah. The landowner made her the caretaker of the rice field. -Get away from here! -She drives away the birds that would eat the crops. What is she? A scarecrow? These people are so annoying. Damn! Something like that. Bok, it’s already 10:30. Can you get Grandma to wake up now? Hold on. I’ll try. Grandma? Grandma? Grandma? Sorry, Grandma. What is it? Grandma, all these tourists are here to see you. But I don’t know any of them. Tell them to leave. Grandma, they came all the way from Manila just to see you. I don’t care if they’re from Manila. Why are they here to see me? Am I sick? Am I related to them? Grandma. Grandma, come on. Grandma. -Grandma, please. -One… -Two... -Just this one time. Okay, Grandma. I’m just going to ask them to leave. Tell them to bug off! Rowdy people! Where’s Grandma? Sorry guys. But my grandma is not feeling well today. Oh my, Bok. We travelled for four hours just for her. Maybe we can see her even for just a bit. -A classic nipa hut. -Yes, Bok. We’re getting hungry. We’ve been here the whole day. You know how old people can be so grumpy. I’m really sorry. We’ll wait for her here. We’re willing to wait until her mood lightens up. Come on, guys! Let’s cheer for Grandma Igna. One, two, three! Grandma Igna! Grandma Igna! Grandma Igna! Louder! -Grandma Igna! -Louder! Grandma Igna! Grandma Igna! She’s coming out! Grandma! Grandma! Smile, Grandma! Grandma, where are you going? Let’s wait for her to come back. Show yourself. She’s here! I’m sorry for what happened. It's okay. But that old woman is something else! I stink now! Good thing we bought a souvenir shirt, because we’re going to get wet. What are you wearing? You look like a cow that got beat up! Idiot! Crop tops are in right now! What are you talking about? You homo! Grandma Igna? Grandma Igna? Who told you to come into my house? Get out! -Grandma, I’m your great-great-grandchild. -Demented! Get out! Grandma Igna, I’m Ana’s son. Ana? Are you really Ana's child? Why, Grandma? You smell of piss. Well, you threw your piss at me. Grandma, why did you throw your piss at the tourists? I don't like them. Grandma, don’t you know how much help they bring to our neighbors? To me? They are helping us earn in other ways, aside from farming. Grandma, we are earning more money now thanks to you. So please, don’t be mean to them. Grandma, I plugged in my charger, if that’s all right. What is that scoundrel doing here? Nida! He’s your nephew, Ana’s son. You? Hi, Auntie. When I saw you on the news, I asked Mama if you were really my Grandma-grandma. When she said yes, I decided to come here. Why do you call her Grandma-grandma? Because she’s the grandmother of our grandmother. Why didn’t your mother come with you? She’s busy. And the doctor advised her not to take long trips. Because she is pregnant. She’s pregnant again? Oh, so who is the father of the baby this time? Nida! Uncle Joey. He isn't my father, just my stepfather. Who’s your father? I don’t know. Mama said he’s dead. But I think she’s just hiding the truth from me. She probably thinks I’m going to pester her about it. Grandma, may I put you in my vlog? Bla? Vlog? Vlog? Yes, vlog! Just like this. Grandma! Smile! He’s going to take a video of you. Yes. I really want to become a vlogger. I just thought that if I put you in my vlog, your fame might just rub off on me. Is that okay? Go ahead! Vlog me all you want! Thanks, Grandma! I really want to document you in my vlog when you get that award from the Amazing People of the World. Is that right? If you didn’t see Grandma on the news, you wouldn't have come here. I only found out where you live on the news. Mama never mentioned you guys to me. Tim, we don’t know for sure if Grandma’s going to get the award. They still need to verify her documents. We should think positive. I’m confident Grandma will win. I feel proud knowing that Grandma Igna will be awarded Do you like the sound of that, Grandma? He’s a chatterbox just like Carias. We’ll go ahead, Grandma. Bok, let’s go! I need to be at the store early tomorrow. We’ll go ahead. All right. -Bok! -Coming! Grandma. God bless you. Take care. Cousin, we’ll go ahead! Grandma, who are they? This is my husband Carias. Carias, this is Tim. Ana’s son. This is where I put all the photos of my relatives who have passed away. Grandma, -why include Mama here? -Oh! It’s been a very long time since we heard any news about her. After leaving this town many years ago, she never came back to visit us. Not even once. We all thought she was dead. Now we know she’s still alive. -Grandma, let me help you. -No, I’m fine. -But I insist. -I can do this. Thanks, Grandma. What now? Is it your first time to see an old lady peeing on a chamber pot? Yes. Well, you’re going to see this every day. Are you going to be startled each time? Finish your food quickly, child. We will go for a stroll. Okay, Grandma. Your phone’s ringing. Answer it. Who’s that? No one. Nothing? Wrong number. My grandmother is so cute. Grandma, let me help you out. I can cross this with my eyes closed. That's my Grandma, so confident right? Are you sure, Grandma? Yes. I’m going to take a video of you. Smile, Grandma! Grandma, look at the camera. Smile! You’re so beautiful, Grandma. It’s a little slippery. It rained last night. I should be extra careful. Good morning, Grandma Igna. Good morning to you too, Berto. May God have mercy on you. -Grandma. -May God have mercy on you, too. Where are you going? We are on our way to see you. Helen’s about to give birth any time now. We would appreciate it if you can assist her during her delivery. I have not done this in a very long time, Berto. Don’t you know that? Why don’t you go to Simang? Simang left for Qatar years ago. She’s now a midwife there. Why don’t you take your wife to the hospital? It’s far from here, and we can’t afford it. Come on, Grandma. I promise you I won’t give you a hard time. I’m a veteran. -This is our fourth child already. -That's right. Look, my hands are shaking. I don’t feel confident in helping women give birth anymore. What if I drop your baby accidentally? You don’t want that to happen, right? I wish I could, my dear. All right, Grandma. Thank you anyway. -Let’s go, Berto. -Thank you. Helen, hold on. You’re going to have a boy. Really? How could you tell? You look ugly when pregnant. You’re joking, right? I’m not joking! If a woman stays pretty when pregnant, it’s a girl. But if she looks horrible, then it’s a boy. -Okay, Grandma. -We’ll go ahead. Take care of your wife. Thank you. I didn't know you were a midwife here. Grandma, I’m going to take a video of you. Okay. Grandma, do you want me to teach you how to use this? Don’t bother. I’m too old to learn new trends. I might just drop it. Let me teach you instead. Once you pull the string, the cans will make a loud noise. It will drive all the birds away! Wow! You’re so high-tech, Grandma-grandma! This is really great! Everyone, watch your step. The path gets narrow. But when we get there, it’ll be a bit wider. Just stay close and follow me. Grandma, Bok is here. There are many tourists here to see you. Annoying! Grandma, these people came from all over the country just to take pictures with you. I don’t care. I don’t know them. Close all the windows. Tell them to go home. Grandma, come on. You also tried to send me away when I first got here. Then you found out I’m your great-great grandchild. What if I did not have this chance to get to know you? And please be kind to Bok. He’s going to be humiliated in front of the tourists. I don’t want to. Son, let’s drink! Grandma, I don't consume alcoholic drinks. I started drinking when I was fourteen years old. Thanks for the offer, Grandma. Wouldn’t it be nice if you win the prize for being the oldest living grandmother in the world? I’m happy because it would make your Auntie Nida happy. But I don’t really need this, do I? I can’t take that with me to my grave. Even if I don’t get that title, I’d still go up to heaven. Grandma, are you sure you’re going to heaven? You told me to think positive! Grandma, you have to get that title. I’m already looking forward to your award. Anything for you, son. -Cheers! -Okay. -Let’s watch our video. -Where? We are walking on the rice paddies. -You’re so handsome. -Grandma is taking us out on a tour. Who’s there? Who could that stupid person be? Who are you people? Carias, is that you? Dear husband! Are you here to fetch me, my love? I’m coming with you! Grandma? Damn these bugs! They got to this wood before I did. These termites ate all the wood! Grandma? Grandma? I’ve been looking everywhere for you. I need to get ready. Carias is going to take me away with him. What did you say, Grandma? You can do that tomorrow. Let’s go to sleep. Are you going to come with me tomorrow, Tim? Okay, Grandma. But let’s go to bed. All right. Let’s go, Grandma. Let me help you up. Here we are. Good morning, Gusting! Grandma Igna, good morning. May God have mercy on you. This is Tim, Ana’s son. I’m just going to buy something to drink. -Okay. -He’s so handsome! How may I help the oldest living grandmother in the Philippines? I wanted to borrow your saw and hammer. Saw and hammer? What for? It’s none of your business. On second thought, I think I just forgot where I placed them. Gusting, you’re such a gossip! I’m going to make my coffin. I’m going to die soon! We’re all going to die, Grandma Igna. But it seems you’re the only who’s so excited about it! Why are you in a hurry? Excited? Are you going to let me borrow your tools or not? Fine. But why? I had a premonition last night in the rice field. I saw Carias. My husband wants to take me with him. -Is that true? -Yes. We are going to be together again. You know what, I can just give you my coffin instead. Or you can go borrow Nida’s coffin. She has one, doesn’t she? No thanks. Someone will help me make my own. Okay, let me go get those tools. Here it is. Just wait for your great-great grandchild to come. Thank you. I wonder, who’s going to come for me when I die? I don’t have a wife. I’m a single old man. Who’s going to fetch me when I die? -Magda told me… -What? You had relationships with Waldo, Polding, and Horacio. May God bless their souls. I’m sure one of them is going to fetch you. Oh Grandma, let's let those three rest. Someone might hear you. They might think I’m some kind of harlot. -You’re not a teen anymore. -Grandma. I know you very well, Gusting. I helped your mother when she delivered you. When I first heard you cry, I knew you were from a different breed! How? You meowed like a female kitten. You mean a gay kitten? Okay, I’ll leave you to it. If your premonition comes true, I would like to thank you now for everything you did for me. This is beautiful, Grandma! There are lots of trees! Nature’s treasure. Let’s go, Tim. All right. Predo! Grandma! Good morning, Grandma Igna. Good morning. May God have mercy on you. Thank you. This is my great-great grandchild, Tim. Ana’s son. -How are you, Tim? -I’m good. Do you need anything? I would like to buy scraps of wood. Grandma, I’ll give them to you for free. Just take whatever you need. Thank you. No worries. Is this big enough, Grandma? It should be as tall as me. How about this one? -That’s good! -Good job! Predo, thank you very much! We're heading home now. Don’t mention it, Grandma. Come by my house. We have plenty of fat frogs. Okay! Wow, these are heavy. Let me help you. No need, Grandma. I can handle this. There we go. Tim? Yes, Grandma? Don’t ever mention this to anyone, not even to your Auntie Nida and Bok. Okay? -What is it? -Promise me? Grandma-grandma, you’re so secretive! All right, I promise. What is it? I saw your Grandpa Carias last night. Grandpa? My husband. He came to take me. At last, my day of death will finally come soon. Grandma, please don't say such things. I know my death is coming soon. I’m sure because of the signs. And you’re going to make my coffin. Grandma, don’t say that. You want my help on that?! Come on, let’s go home. -Tim! -Grandma? -Tim! -Yes? I’m just going to take a nap. If tourists come, don’t bother waking me up. Okay? Okay, Grandma. This medium shirt looks good on you! It fits me very well. I’ll get this. Here’s my payment. Oh, okay. How much? What was the price I told you? 350. -Next time around buy a black one. -Thank you. Okay, thank you. Is Tita Nida here? Aren’t you Ana’s son? Yes. Is Auntie Nida here? Hold on. Nida! Tim, what’s the matter? Auntie, there’s something I want to tell you. What is it? Hey! What were you going to tell me? Forget about it. Let’s talk next time. What does he want? Probably a souvenir. Souvenir? WHERE ARE YOU, TIM? PLEASE COME HOME. I’M WORRIED ABOUT YOU. Come on cousin, let’s eat! Okay. What are you doing? Editing my videos. Hey, that’s Grandma. Come on, upload it. Leave it for later. Aren’t you vlogging so that everyone can watch it? I’m going to edit them first. Yeah, right. Include this one, too. -Come on, let’s eat. -Okay. Cousin, let's eat. I'm starving. Tim, come and eat. It's okay, I don't have an appetite. Tim, I know you wanted to have this. But the saleslady was sour at you. Thank you. Are you still up, Tim? Tim? I’m already asleep, Grandma. You’re just like your Grandpa Carias, a smart ass! Who would be able to sleep, Grandma? If a person you love tells you that they are about to die. I’m sorry for telling you, my Grandchild. You see, I have no one else to talk to about this. And I knew you would understand your grandmother. Why do you want to die so soon, Grandma? Even if you know that you will be leaving behind plenty of people who love you. You know, when your mother told me she wanted to leave this town, I didn’t stop her. Even though I knew that she would leave us. Because I thought she would find happiness wherever she was going. Until now, your Auntie Nida has not forgiven your Mother for leaving us all. I’m hoping she will forgive Ana eventually. Tim, why did you leave your mother? Why did you run away from home? How did you know that? You came here because you knew that this is the one place your mother would never return to. She won’t follow you here. Mama’s got a new husband. They also have a baby together. I don’t have a place in their family. They’re happy even without me. Mom is happy without me. She and Uncle Joey would often fight. He hurts Mama when she defends me. Now, I’m not such a hindrance to them. And I can feel that Mama does not care about me anymore. Tim, I know for a fact that your Mama loves you very, very much. Even if she has a new family. Even if she has another child. Aren’t you happy? You’re going to be a big brother. I don’t know, Grandma. Tim, call your Mama. I want to see her. Grandma, you’re asking me to do a difficult thing. Tim, don’t tell me you will skip breakfast. Grandma, Uncle Gusting... He left us. But where did he go? He’s gone. His nephew said he did not wake up this morning. He died in his sleep. May his soul reach the heavens. -Good evening, Grandma Igna. -Good evening. Slowly, Grandma. Grandma Igna, someone went ahead of you again. You, Magda... send me a notice when you're up next okay? Jesus, you really are... My God.. You really do not want to... take me yet? Why is that so? Whoever is ready, whoever is willing, is not the person that you take away. Have a happy journey, Gusting. Grandma. Grandma, that's enough. Let's go to sleep. Go ahead, Tim. Let me finish this. You know, Gusting was the first baby I helped deliver into this world. You’ve been a midwife for so long, Grandma. The first baby you delivered is very mature now. Why did you stop? Grandchild, all professionals need to retire at some point. Wise old folks say that I lived this long because I helped deliver many babies in this town. How many children did you help deliver? Almost everyone in this town. No wonder you got to live this long. That’s why I stopped assisting in giving births. You know what, I’ve been in this world for too long. I have experienced infinite loneliness that would reach the heavens. All of my loved ones have passed on, that shouldn't have happened. I should've gone before them. I’ve been to too many wakes and more than my share of funerals. Yet, I am the one who is always left behind always left grieving! That's enough, Grandma. You've had too much to drink now. All of them. My children went ahead of me. My husband. All of my friends. I’m sick and tired of this life. I don’t know the people here anymore. I don’t recognize this town anymore. Don't cry. Drink with me. Tastes good, right? It’s strong and bitter. Annoying! Who's there? It's too early and you're too noisy! Tim! Tim! What’s that noise? It’s too early! What are you doing there? You don’t like it? I’m going to tear it down. No! No, continue to work on it! Sorry about that. WAKE UP, GRANDMA IGNA! COFFIN FOR SALE Bok, it’s already 10:30am. Is Grandma coming out? Sorry guys, Grandma Igna can’t come and meet you today. It’s finished, Grandma. Grandma, does it look good? Very beautiful, Grandchild. Thank you very much. Don't mention it. Just hide it underneath our house. Okay, Grandma. We just want to have a picture with her. Jeez! I’ve been here several times. I’m really sorry. That’s Grandma Igna! Grandma! Grandma! Who wants to be the first to take a selfie with me? One at a time. You guys go first. Thank you, Grandma! Come here next to Grandma. You, go to the other side. Let me take a photo of you. Selfie with Grandma? Okay. Hurry up! Just wait. You're next in line. Let’s pose, Grandma. One more time, Grandma. Grandma! Grandma! Tim, Grandma fainted! Help! Grandma Igna! Grandma! -Give her some breathing space. -Grandma! Move! Careful. There's an evil spirit surrounding your Grandma Igna. An evil spirit? An evil spirit that's making her weak. Will she ever wake up? We don’t know when. But we hope we can drive away the evil spirit surrounding her. Grandma told me something the other day. I woke up to see that she wasn't in her bed one night. I looked everywhere for her. Then I saw her in the rice field. I asked her what she was doing there. But when she saw me, she was so happy. She told me... What did she say? She made me promise not to tell you. Then why did you have to bring it up? Tim, you need to tell us. It might be what’s causing her all this trouble. We won’t tell on you. Come on, this will be our little secret. She said she saw… Who? Many of them. Who are you talking about? Them. This is a premonition of Igna’s impending death. We have to prepare candles and a basin of water. Okay. I’ll let Nida know. Uncle Rene, do premonitions really happen? When you’re old and dead, loved ones show themselves to you, which is a sign that they are coming to get you. What will happen to my merchandise if Grandma Igna finally dies? She can’t die. What will happen to her award? She needs to get that title. Nida, that title is all you care about? Eddie, once we get the title, that means Grandma Igna is still alive. Do premonitions happen right away? How should I know? Carias did not speak to me. What are we going to do? Let's try to counter it. Uncle Rene, what are you doing? Stop it, that's enough! Grandma asked me to make that! Tim, let him do his job. Grandma is going to be furious! Grandma Igna does not need this yet. But Grandma asked me to make that for her! Please, stop it! Tim, let it go! Why did you come here? We saw on the news that Grandma Igna is unconscious. We came here to put these up. Wake up, Grandma Igna. Wake up! Also, we would like to take a selfie with her. Just one selfie, that’s all we want. -Chammy. -Yes? Maybe we can take a selfie with Grandma Igna even if she’s sleeping. Are you nuts? That’s creepy! We walked all the way here just to see her. That’s why I hope she wakes up. Come on, let’s pray together. Wake up, Grandma Igna. Wake up. Grandma Igna helped a lot of people in this town. She used to be a midwife when she was younger. Me, Gusting, and Helen... She helped give birth to us and almost everyone in this town. We’ll do everything that we can for Grandma Igna. Bok, if I’m not around, you and Tim are in charge of Grandma Igna. Use the umbrella to shelter me, not only yourself. Daniel, look at me! I’m all wet. I’m sorry, Mayor. Nida. -Good morning, Mayor. -Good morning. Good morning. This is Doctor Perez. He’s here to see Grandma Igna. Please, come in. Grandma lost consciousness because of extreme fatigue and stress. When she fainted, she hit her head, had a stroke, and went into a coma. Don't worry too much. Her blood pressure and heart rate are normal. Doctor, will she ever wake up? Probably in a few days, but it might take longer. If we bring her to the hospital, will she wake up sooner? That’s not a guarantee. It would be better if Grandma Igna stays here because of her old age. Don’t worry, I'll send a nurse here to keep watch on your grandma. Thank you, Doctor. Mayor. Your hand is wet. We have to go, Nida. Take care of Grandma Igna. It would be a waste if she dies before she receives the award. It will only be a few days before we find out the result. I will do everything I can, Mayor. You should. Grab the umbrella. Hello, Mom? Hello, Tim. Tim, my son. Where are you? I’m very worried about you. I’m here at Grandma Igna’s place. She refused to help with my delivery because she is already weak. Poor Grandma Igna. I hope she wakes up soon. I hope the thing we fear does not happen. But I do hope we still get the title for the benefit of everyone here in Barrio Alhaya. I’m Tim, Grandma Igna’s great-great grandchild. I hope she wakes up soon, so we can still bond a little longer. Why are you crying? Smoke got in my eyes. I’m excited to find out the result from the Amazing People of the World. It doesn't matter whether Grandma gets it or not. The important thing is she gets better. But I already had this made! Look! Look, isn't it beautiful? I'll post this as soon as Grandma gets the title! Beautiful, isn’t it? Ana! How are you? I’m doing well, Senya. Big sister, how are you? I still have a lot to do. Your sister is probably tired. Why don’t you visit your Grandma Igna? -All right, Senya. -Okay. Grandma, take a look at these shots. You’re so adorable. I hope you wake up soon so you can see this. -Mom? -Tim. Mom, I'm sorry that I ran away from home. The important thing is you’re here. Grandma, this is Ana. I’m already here. Grandma? Thank you, Bok. How’s Grandma? She hasn’t woken up yet. Big sister, join us. I prepared dinner. No, I don't feel well. Ana, when did you get here? Just this afternoon. How are you? I’m all right. Eddie, Bok, let’s go. We’ll go ahead, Ana. Tim! Okay. Mom. Grandma-grandma! I need to take a leak. Where are you going? I'm going to town! What?

Who among you wants to be the first to have a selfie with me? Me! Me! Grandma! Grandma! Grandma, let me help you. Don’t bother. Ana, you know how Grandma is. She doesn’t want anybody helping her out. You haven’t changed one bit, Grandma. You said it. Stop it, you two! I'm just happy that we all got together before I join my beloved Carias. Grandma. Grandma, don’t say such a thing. Children, we should not fear death. Remember that. Let’s all pray. In the name of the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit. You know what, Tim? When I was young, I used to come here with your Grandma Igna. We would watch over the rice field. My sister and I would race to the ropes whenever there were pesky birds. Whoever reaches the ropes first, wins. Why did you run away to here? Nothing. I saw Grandma on the news. And you haven’t come back here since you left. I didn’t get the chance to know Grandma Igna. Did you and Uncle Joey have a fight again? I left your Uncle Joey. You were right, that jerk is an asshole! I've been telling you for a long time that we should go and leave him. But no, you didn't want to. You were so madly in love with that guy. Son, I’m so sorry if I didn't... Ana! Tim! Come home! Let’s have breakfast while it’s hot! All right, Grandma. Let’s go, son. -Be careful. -Okay. You guys had too much fun. What is it, Mom? Sit down, slowly. Grandma! Hold on. Grandma, It seems like Mama is about to give birth! Mom! Mom! Help! Grandma help! -Come on, Grandma! -Grandma’s here. Grandma! I’m here, my child. One more time. Push! I can already see the head. One more push. There we go. It’s a girl, Ana. It’s a girl. Mom? Mom? Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom. Ana. Mom! Ana. Mom! Mom! My condolences. Thank you. May God have mercy on you. Your Mom is happily on her journey to the next life. I regret to inform you that Grandma Igna did not get the title... This was given to Jacqueline Trevor from Georgia. Thank you very much. Put that down. Take that down, too. I wish for you to go sleep already Go to sleep So you can grow up And finish your studies Are you taking a video of me again? How does that work? This one, Grandma? Would you like to learn? I’ll show you how. If you want to open this one, turn the switch to the right. When you see a red dot here, it means recording. And this one? This is called the lens. And if the battery is low, you need to charge it so you can use it again. Do you understand, Grandma? I understand it now. Good morning, my little angel. Good morning, big brother. Good morning, baby. Here it is, guys! My Grandma will finally give me a tour of the town! Grandma, wave to the camera! Hi! My Grandma-grandma is so adorable! Let me help you, Grandma. I can cross this with my eyes closed. That's my Grandma. Very confident right? -Are you sure, Grandma? -Yes. I’m going to take a video of you. Smile, Grandma. -Grandma, look at the camera. -Wait a second. Smile! So beautiful. Predo! Grandma! I wish for you to go to sleep already So you can grow up And finish your studies Are you taking a video of me again?
