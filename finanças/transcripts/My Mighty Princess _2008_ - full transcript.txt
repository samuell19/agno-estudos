We can communicate without talking. Because she understands my mind language. If you can hear me now, You will also be able to understand the stories Told between the masters using telepathy. I will tell you our story in my mind language. The Green Destiny! The Moon Stroke! Dad! I asked you to wake me up at 5! You were sleeping so soundly after coming home so late I didn't wake you up on purpose So that you can get a good sleep I'm late! My baby girl. I told you we are performing today! That's why I came home so late last night... You drive me crazy! It's almost ready, So-hui! You should eat something before you go! You should have woke me up earlier! So-hui! Just try this! It's good! Sorry! So sorry! Sorry! Hi! She's here! So-hui's here! Get up! You're the only one late. Wig, wig, get your wig on! Ladies and gentlemen, Charyeok* Club will now begin its performance (a form of qigong) Once upon a time, in a peaceful little country, There lived a beautiful princess. People called her Princess Mighty One day, Princess met the prince from neighboring country at a ball They fell in love but in order to get married They had to accomplish five tasks. The first task is to walk across a red-hot fire. Will the princess manage it? Our good Princess Mighty completed all the tasks And married her Prince in the end. We hope you enjoyed our show. A round of applause for our Princess Mighty! Princess Mighty! Princess Mighty! How do you feel? I feel... tipsy! Mister, wait! Mister! Take him to this address. He'll wake up on the way so don't worry. The tarif should come to 6,800 won so keep the change. Thank you! Oh, that Princess Mighty? Is she a human or what? Is she a human? Isn't she a robot? A girl should be like a girl. I'm damn scared to see her on the street. I want to see her foot. I bet it would be like the bear's one. And her parents, they might be some kind of medicine peddlers. They might sell the fraud medicine and show the performance. Those stunts must be what's learnt from those parents. Who know, she might have learnt it getting hit with a whip. Just like when you tame hedgehog. Hedgehog? I'm talking about treating someone inhumanly. Bus is here. I wish she was my girl friend. Why? Whenever I'm stressed, it would be fun to hit her with things like bottles or wooden stick. That sounds cool. Why don't you learn Charyeok too? So I can beat you. Let's take a taxi. Whenever I see a girl like that, I become to admire her. But is she a girl for real? I felt sick the whole time I was watching it. That is act of destroying dignity of human beings. It must be banned worldwide. Hey, why did you stop so suddenly? How could you be so indifferent after surprising me like that? Does it hurt? Most people will faint in this situation Are you all right? Did it leave a hole? Shouldn't we take you to the hospital? I'm fine, it's not the first time. Who are you? What? Well, I... I'm just watching. See that door over there? See yourself out through that door. Sir, I go to this school. And I want to join the ice hockey club. We don't need a girl. I'll do whatever you say. I used to be a member of Charyeok Club. I'm really strong and... I'll do anything! You! Ever sharpened skate blades before? Well it doesn't really matter. You'll learn soon enough. Hey you! You can stop now! Get out! Thank you. I'm Kang So-hui, the newest member. I'll be sharpening your blades. Sorry, so sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Hey! Yes? New members have to drink from a skate. Are you willing to do that? Yes! I'll be happy to. Hello! I'm Ji-yeon, So-hui's friend. So-hui hasn't come home yet. Well, I just came by to give her this. It's a recording of last night's performance. All right, I'll give it to her. Have you had dinner yet? No. Well, then, go home and enjoy your dinner. Uh... Good-bye. Something urgent came up... Jun-mo! You shouldn't be driving drunk. Leave your motorbike. Let me go! But you can't... Motorbikes are so dangerous. You can't go. Hey, what the... When did you get on? Sorry but can I put my arms around your waist? Where have you been holding on to all this time? Hey, get off. Here? I have some business here so go home. You are trying my patience, kid. Go home right now. Until you agree to go out with me I'll come by every day. When will you grow up? If you insist on staying, go stand in the back. What's wrong? You! Well, I was just... Worried about you. Go home... It's okay. Can't you spare just five minutes for me? Honeybear... Don't call me that. I'm old enough to be your mother. Honeybear, I love you. Watch your mouth, kid. Officer Kim, I'm going on patrol. Going alone? Wait until Officer Jo comes back. Hey! Pay up. Huh? Where is this bus headed? Gupabal. That's the opposite direction from home. So what? Let me off! No! Get off at the next stop. I'm home. Can I see you for a minute? ...called her Princess Mighty I'm sorry, dad. Really, I don't understand. That's really you? Is that how I taught you? Just look at your posture! You should be training harder or else that's what you get! What the hell is this? If you stand like that, you might break your back! And when you are stepping on fire, you should be doing hypogastric breathing first! Or you'll lose all your qi! Charyeok is the basis for all martial arts. I quit the Charyeok Club. You must... inherit your mother's Lightning Stroke! I don't like martial arts any more. I hate Charyeok and I hate mom's Lightning Stroke. I want to live like a normal girl. What did you say in the past? I'm in college now, dad. I'm going to do what I want to do. I've never been a normal girl. Then what will happen to our illustrious heritage? You'll ignore your mother's dying wish? I don't care. It's not my responsibility. Are you really going to disappoint me like this? I can't help it. I don't want to live like you! Just please let me do what I want to do for once! It's been a long time, Chang-hak. The Mengzhu has summoned the Four Masters? Take them down! Mengzhu! The sign language tactic! You scumbags! Who do you think you are meddling with? Get out of here. You scumbags. Mengzhu! How have you all been? It's been a long time. I summoned you on an urgent business. Mengzhu! I have nowhere to turn. The sorrow of being homeless. I spent my life begging. With the sky as my roof. I found a quiet place to spend my last days. But with so many flies around. How will... I rest in peace? Master, this is pure poetry! Now it's my turn. The Matrix tactic! The charyeok tactic! I can see that your skills have not rusted. It means you have not been lazy. You really think so? Thank you, Mengzhu! Hi! Hello! How are you doing? What's up? Stop bothering me. Just go and sharpen blades. Isn't that what the lady officer at the police station told you? Oops, right on the spot. Look who's hurting, look who's hurting~ Sorry, didn't mean to poke fun. I'm going now to sharpen blades. Be careful! Hey, are you all right? Yes. Are you a gymnast? No! It missed me by pure luck when I fell backwards. What did you say your name was? What? Kang So-hui. So-hui? Our clans have inherited the martial arts skills for generations. But what is happening these days? Only the elders show up at the martial arts competitions or other meetings. Young people are not participating any more. This cannot go on. We need a solution. You are right... Mengzhu, even my daughter. She goes off to college and suddenly quits Charyeok Club. Says she doesn't want to live like me. And wants to live her own life. I was planning to teach her. her mother's Lightning Stroke this year. But I don't think I can any more. Even your daughter, the prodigy? But your son was the hard-worker. No, that bastard is crazy about motorbikes now. He lives and dreams for motorbikes. He's always asking me to buy one for him. Suzuki or something. He was even talking about it in his sleep. That son of a bitch. I thought your son and your daughter was. Our best and the brightest. And they were really close. We used to say to each other. That our future lay on their shoulders. Her name is So-hui, right? It seems like yesterday. That we talked about how she was going to be great. Just like her mother. The good old days... But I saw her performing Charyeok on video and she's no good! Her talents are gone. I can't teach her to use a sword without solid basis! My son, that bastard. He can talk about nothing but motorbikes. I wish I could destroy every motorbike in this world. That bastard, son of a bitch. This is a serious problem. In the next competition, Only the successors of each house may enter. Cheonpoong! Yes? What if I buy him the motorbike? What? Why would you do that? Your son's name is Il-yeong, right? I don't even want to hear his name. That son of a bitch. Nothing is too good for my So-hui to start training again. And enter the next martial arts competition. But even if he is crazy about motorbikes, Why should you buy him one? I'll give the bastard a call anyway. How much does a motorbike cost anyway? A Suzuki is pretty expensive! It's going to cost you at least ten grand. To fifteen at least! What? FIFTEEN GRAND? What did I tell you. He's crazy about motorbikes. That bastard is coming right now on KTX. That bastard, son of a bitch. So-hui! Huh? Is that you, Il-yeong? Excuse me! So-hui! It's been so long... Didn't you miss me? Well, uh, sometimes? Now sit! I've saved you a seat. Hey, get out of here! You shouldn't be here. All right, i'll wait outside. I'll see you after class. Go away! Go! Go away! You haven't changed a bit. Nor you! Why are you here? Well... I missed you. Let's start training again. We'll make a fine team. I quit. Why? You are the daughter of So Ok-soon, the Lightning Stroke. So what? I'm just a normal college kid now. Thank you very much. Think what you told me years ago. You said you wanted to live like a hero in the wuxia novels! Well, I was going through puberty then. Hey, from what I see, you are still in puberty! Did you see that? That's the one! Suzuki GSX 1300R, aka Hayabusa! I wonder how it would feel to ride her every day. But no worries, she'll be mine soon! Why would anyone put these here? It's heavy... Do you need any help? No, I'm fine. It's heavy... It's okay. Looks heavy. Hello! Bye! What are you doing here again? I pretended to be you. Guess what, he didn't notice that I wasn't you. Go away! I got up too early this morning. I think I'll take a nap. Did you come to school to sleep? No? Tell me what I've been lecturing up till now. Wrong classroom. Do you know him? No, I don't. You REALLY don't know him? No, I really don't. So-hui, I'll be waiting outside! You are really stubborn. Don't you go to school? I took this year off. I have to serve in the military anyway. I don't want to go back to the childish days, okay? You get it? Damn, it burst. You ARE still a child. I'm old enough to get married now. And have kids, even. This curve... Such softness... Such comfort when I touch her... The sound of engine waking my instincts. The engine! They're supposed to be playing an amateur team today. Is that how you play ice hockey? No, they're fighting! What are you doing? Come and break up this fight! Jun-mo! Let go! Was that you who just tossed those guys? You... No! They say you exert unnatural powers in case of emergency. This never happened to me before. I swear! You bastards. You think ice hockey is some kind of combat sport? You bastards. Never during the twenty years of coaching. Have I seen a varsity team get in fight with amateurs! Hey, Kang So-hui! Can't you see I'm disciplining these guys? Stop sharpening and leave! You, white-face, leave as well! Oh no, I have to go to the library. Let's go get a drink. No! I have a lot of homework. It's raining, perfect for a drink. Hey, I told you, I can't. All right! Then take my umbrella. Ready? One two three. It's stopped. Let's go. Drinks! This way! Get out. You have to leave. Cheon Il-yeong, what are you doing up there? I'm leaving. Bye~ Wait... So-hui. So-hui? Where did you get this umbrella? Why do you ask? I borrowed it. You stole it? No, I BORROWED it. Whose is it? A friend... Here it is. See you! Good bye. I hope I don't see you again. Good bye. I'll see you tomorrow. I'll kill you if you come again. See you tomorrow. I'll kill you. Kid, I'm telling you she's old enough to be your mother. Whatever, where is she? She's on patrol, kid. You have to wait if you want to see her. Area 340 is the overpass under the elevated road in Ungbong-dong, right? That kid can understand police radio? Mister, follow that motorbike! What do you think this is, a cab? Let me go, for crying out loud. Officer Choi, no! Let me go. Everybody stand still. If you move an inch, I'm going to shoot! So-hui. So-hui? What are you doing here? I followed you on the bus! You are helpless... Look before you leap, idiot What shall we do? We should fight, of course. But I thought you had nothing more to do with martial arts. Stop joking! I don't want Jun-mo to see my face. Camouflage... Camouflage? Hey, don't move! How do I look? Do I look like a guy? We're ready! Are you... So-hui? Kang So-hui, right? I don't know what you're talking about. Are you hurt? Seems like our job here is over, partner. Shall we go? Shall we? Isn't it nice to stretch your muscles? No. Admit it - you were enjoying it! I'm thirsty. Wait, I'll go get something to drink. Go see a doctor. Get out. Can I see you smile, just once? I don't have the luxury of smiling for other people. Get out. That girl who came with you the other night... She likes you. The one who likes you is the most precious. Then... shouldn't you consider me most precious? Stop! Stop it! I'm going! You got me a beer? We're grown up now... We shouldn't be drinking coke any more. Cheers. I sometimes have the same dream over and over. You are always in that dream. We're on a cliff with the sea far below. The moon is shining in the sky and I can see an island far away. I see the waves in the sea. There's a big flat rock on that cliff And I'm doing the sword dance with the Green Destiny. you are sitting comfortably behind, watching me. I had the same dream several times. Everything is the same. Even your expression. That is not a dream. So-hui and me... It all happened in the past. But she just doesn't remember. I spend a lot of time with So-hui since we were little. Born into prominent martial arts clans. We were more keen on the training than school. But no-one could beat So-hui and me. In turn, I couldn't beat So-hui. And everyone called her the prodigy. Maybe it was inevitable. Her father was the master of Charyeok called Cheolgak. And her mother was the master of Lightning Stroke, So Ok-soon. They say her mother could cut down a tree with a blade of grass. So-hui had inherited both their talents. We wanted to live like one of the heroes in the wuxia novels. I wanted to see her do the sword dance with the Green Destiny. So-hui. Huh? Have you ever seen the Green Destiny? No. Don't you want to do the sword dance with the real Green Destiny? Green Destiny is the treasured sword of Wutang Clan in China. A monk was presented with the sword over one hundred years ago. Green Destiny was so precious that it was only displayed to the public every three years During the martial arts competition. We only meant to touch it. I don't think it's for children to play with. Hand it over. It doesn't seem like it belongs to you either. We are going to put it back. So-hui, no! So-hui! Let's start training again. No! Why? The only reason I did it was because of my parents. What good is that? No, you did it because you wanted to! See here. See the scar? I had an accident in 10th grade. But I don't remember anything about it. You never came to see me after the accident. Mengzhu! He, he mastered the Moon Stroke with the Green Destiny. The only way to subdue him is with the Lightning Stroke. He is... He is... Mengzhu! - Mengzhu! - Mengzhu! Mengzhu! Start moving and do your job, your bastard! Remember you're playing for our team, not theirs! I really have to find a replacement. Move faster! Hello! What am I going to do with him? Hello, hello! Use your body! Kang So-hui! So-hui! She's fainted. What the hell is wrong with you? This is so unlike you. She's smiling! How many fingers am I holding up? Two. How about this? Three! You are a natural athlete. Either you trained in martial arts, or are just born with it. The moonlight collected on the tip of the sword. Is said to generate enormous power. Just one stroke equals a thousand spears. That is the Moon Stroke. The Moon Stroke is not complete without the Green Destiny. Heuk-bong is the one who stole it! The only thing that can stop the Moon Stroke is the Lightning Stroke. One that only So-hui's mother could use... We are expecting 30 to 60 milliliters of heavy rain. Including 20 to 30 in the southern part of the country. In the central area, we expect about 20 to 30 milliliters of heavy rain. Excuse me. This message is for Heuk-bong! Come to the old training ground at 9pm on the full moon night! Gab-seong will accept your challenge! Come to the old training ground at 9pm on the full moon night! Come to the old training ground on the full moon night! This message is for Heuk-bong! 9pm! What do you think you're doing? Wake up, Kang So-hui! Yes sir! Il-yeong, is that you? The Green Destiny! My motorbike's gone! I began to grow weaker when my mother died. I didn't eat all day. I had anorexia. People said that I would never live past 10. Then my father forced me to play sports. I guess one has to eat after playing so much sports. I was reborn playing ice hockey. Even today. Every living moment counts then. We both lost our mothers young. We all lose our mothers sooner or later. Then someone else will take her place. You say you lost your motorbike? Yes. Registration number please. Seoul Jongro Ma 8183. Your name? You know my name. Your name! Jeong Joon-mo. Your phone number? We'll call you when we find it. Come to the station if you have any questions. I'm sorry, Kang So-hui. I don't think I made the moment count. I'm going to regret it. And prepare for entubation! Hello? Il-yeong? Where are you? What? I'm sorry dad. I should have listened to you. Dad... Everything began then... Before you were born... Maybe during the time you were conceived... Suddenly a man showed up at a martial arts competition. Stole Green Destiny and ridiculed the wulin. From now on, - Green Destiny belongs to Heuk-bong. - It was Heuk-bong As long as I hold the Green Destiny. I am the mengzhu! He called himself the next mengzhu of the wulin. As he was the son of mengzhu, no-one dared to cross him. The wulin were collapsing under his feet. Then someone volunteered to save the wulin. It was your mother, So Ok-soon of the Lightning Stroke. You were conceived but no-one knew. Your mother fought Heuk-bong for four days and nights. But neither won. The mengzhu ordered that Heuk-bong's life be spared. So she could not use her fatal move, the Lightning Stroke. After fighting for four days. Your mother was exhausted. And so was Heuk-bong. Despite her endeavor, The mengzhu forgave Heuk-bong after recovering the Green Destiny. Your mother grew weaker as a result. And after she gave birth to you. She dictated to your father the secret of the Lightning Stroke for you. This is the right way, right? After the accident... You were in the hospital for over a week. But showed no signs of recovery. I knew later. That the sword that wounded you was poisoned. Heuk-bong was the only one who would do such a thing. And he was the only one with the antidote. - Coward. - Have you come for this? A young girl is dying because of you! Good boy... If you promise to become my disciple. I'll give you the antidote. I gave up the fight in order to get the antidote. I can't wake up from his hypnosis. I have the Green Destiny in my hand. But I can't make it sound the way Heuk-bong did. You shall now become Heuk-bong. You will complete what I started. Whenever someone calls for Heuk-bong, you will go. No-one is stronger than Heuk-bong in this world. But Heuk-bong was hurt as well. He died without setting me free. I'm looking for the sound Heuk-bong made. For such sound... This is the secret book of the Lightning Stroke, as dictated by your mother and written by your father. You father has been training with this secretly. He never attained her level of wugong. And became an easy target for Heuk-bong. So-hui, take this and try to attain her level of wugong. I know you can do it. If you can learn her Lightning Stroke. Bring down Heuk-bong who killed your mother and wounded your father. You are the only one who can subdue him, So-hui. Revenge your parents. Revenge is a law of wulin. That was the Lightning Stroke! Yes, I saw it too! That's it! So Ok-soon lives again! So-hui can beat me. She can set me free from the black magic. If she can slay me... I can die with no regrets. I challenged So-hui. To have her slay me... Il-yeong, that bastard! Step aside. Il-yeong, that bastard! Il-yeong, it's me! Wake up! So-hui, can you hear me? I am communicating with you in telepathy. Il-yeong... Stop defending and attack me! What's going on? Why are you attacking me, Il-yeong? I am under hypnosis Remember what we've been through. I was so glad that you came to my school. Even though I didn't show it. I missed you when you weren't there. I can't help attacking you. My body is no longer mine. Attack me please. Attack now! I'm sorry... If it's what you want... Il-yeong! That's it! Attack me once more! No! I won't! Attack me right now! No! I don't want to hurt you. Now! Il-yeong! No. Not the Moon Stroke! Let go of the sword! Let it go! Il-yeong! Il-yeong, no! Don't! I'm looking for the sound Heuk-bong made. For such sound... Il-yeong! This is not the sound... This is not the one... Il-yeong, stop it... Let it go. I can't control my body! I'm not going to attack you any more. Il-yeong, concentrate! You can break off the hypnosis! No, the more I think of you, the more my body moves otherwise! Then don't think about me, you fool! I can't... You are Il-yeong and no-one else. Il-yeong, concentrate! You can break off the hypnosis! We can do it! Il-yeong! Il-yeong! Il-yeong... I... I think I understood your mind language long before. The things I didn't remember. I remembered by listening to your mind language. I remembered stealing the Green Destiny together. And falling off the cliff... And how you jumped off the cliff to save me.. Dad? Dad! You are such a strong person... I love you so much... So-hui! Dad... Ow! That hurts, So-hui... Now will you buy me a motobike. Why should I buy a motorbike for a bastard like you? It's all thanks to me that So-hui began training again. You said you were going to! Stop it, you bastard. You don't even deserve it. Don't take that tone of voice with me, young man. She can hear my mind language. Next time, I'll tell her. I love you... I love you, So-hui. What? You bastard. Careful, I know exactly what's going through your head... Once upon a time. A beautiful princess lived in a peaceful little country. She was very good as well as being beautiful. She was hard as a rock and strong as a bull. So she could resist any attack. So her people called her the Princess Mighty. One, two three!
