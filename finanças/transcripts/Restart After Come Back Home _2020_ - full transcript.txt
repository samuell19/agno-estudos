I wonder how many people in the world love themselves. I feel as though I've been stuck in a long, endless tunnel. Like I said... isn't this strange?! What is? These estimates are definitely proof. It's impossible to reach the delivery deadline. Is there any point taking this job? You never know until you try it. But No "Buts"! You're all talk and no action. All you do is make complaints! Do you know what we call people like you? A useless human being! Are you running away, Kozuka? Kozuka! Mitsuomi! Mitsuomi! Mitsuomi! You're Mitsuomi? Yes? I knew it! I immediately recognized you! You haven't changed at all! Uh... You seem a little refined. You have become so Tokyo-like. Well... Heading to your family's house, right? What? Right. Uh, wait! Well, get in. There's no need to hesitate. Okay? That's not it. Quick, quick! You must be tired, right? But... No worries, no worries! How long has it been since you've last visited? Seven or eight years ago. Since then, a lot has changed. Well, not so much. Oh. We got an AEON on the other side of the highway. I see. The other day, for the first time in my life... I went to Yoshinoya (Beef bowl restaurant). It was so good! I see. Hello? Oh, Mitsuomi? Mom, where are you now? I'm stuck at a Women’s association meeting. I had asked Yamato to pick you up instead. Yeah, I've already met him. Actually I've already got on. Actually, what? Who is he? Yamato Kumai. He's the son of Grandpa Kumai. Grandpa Kumai? He had a son? He's the same age as you. Get along with him, will you. What? Wait! Hello? Mom? Sorry, I made you wait. Are you Grandpa Kumai’s son? Yeah. So you're... I'm his adopted son. Oh, I see. Nice to meet you, Mitsuomi. Well, let's go. Alright. Kumai? You can call me Yamato. This is the first time we met, right? Yeah. I came here after you had left for Tokyo. Are you familiar with the Kumai's? Too familiar. Because they're friendly. When I first met your Mom... she couldn't stop talking about you. What? I've always wanted to meet you and get to know you. You're the real Mitsuomi. I finally got to meet you. Aren't you a little too excited Even the way you talk sounds very Tokyo-like. That's so cool. Dear, dinner's ready. Dear, dinner's ready. Hurry up and eat. What a surprise. Mitsuomi came back, it's a happy occasion Would you like some hot sake? Yeah. Okay. He came back because he got fired. How's that a happy occasion? I quit on my own. Don't go making assumptions. Don't go thinking it's tough living on your own or how irrational it feels for you. That's what it's like to have a job. So, what are your plans now Any jobs in mind? I could take over the family business. It would be great if there's an inheritor after dad, right? I'll take over it. Besides, there's only me. Do you... remember what you said ten years ago? What? "It's so boring here in the countryside!" Even if I die, I don't want to deal with furniture!” That's the last thing you said and left this house. Even though I said that... Don't say something on a whim because things didn't work out for you in Tokyo! Dear. What the hell? I'm being serious! I could tell by your face whether you're serious or not! You'll eventually become tired and run away. I have no intention of leaving the business to you. There's no need for you to be the next inheritor. Good morning. Good morning. What's for breakfast? It's already eleven. Then, lunch. Okay, okay. Wait just a minute. As we continue, here is the latest news for Chikuma. How long are you going to continue being sloppy? It's been ten days since you've come back. Are you serious about continuing the family business? Go and apologize to your father. Yeah. So, you're not eager, after all. I am. Jeez. I don't want you to become a NEET. Oh, you're Mitsuomi. It's been a while. So, you came back. Uh, yes! Mitsuomi. Mister. Here's what you asked for. Yes, thank you. What are you reading? Are you looking for a job? Uh, why are you here? Delivery. Oh, I see. See ya. You came back to take over your Dad's business, right? That's none of your business, Kumai. Just call me Yamato. Why don't you come over to my place? Huh? After hearing that you've come back, Grandpa wants to meet you. Some other time. Come over. What... what's with you? Come on, come on, come on. I don't want to. Come over! What the hell? Let go! Hey. Hey! Get off! Huh? What's wrong, Mitsuomi? Nothing. Huh? Grandpa? What? What do you mean you're leaving? Now, now! Calm down! I don't understand you. Grandpa! What's going on? Yamato! What? Guego, calm down. Guego, wait! This is not what we talked about. You said you'll be here until spring. I beg you! Please reconsider your decision! Please. I'm sorry, thank you. What? Guego! Wait! Guego! Technical intern? He came from Vietnam to work here. We teach him a lot of things around here. Because it's cheaper to hire foreign workers, right? We don't do that here. That's my seat. Oh, my bad. Wow, it's been a while, Mitsuomi! It's been a while seeing you too. I have no intention to see Grandma yet. I'm home! Oh, how did it go? Guego is going back to Vietnam no matter what. He became homesick because his girlfriend misses him. That's my seat. Oh, what the hell... This is a problem. It's nearing the time for greenhouse labour. Greenhouse Yeah. Mandarins and strawberries. It's the busiest time of the year. It will be too difficult with only I and Yamato. That must be tough. Oh, Mitsuomi, help us out! Huh? You're looking for a job, right? Is that true, Mitsuomi? No, I... Didn't you come back to take over your father's business? No, I... It will be a huge help if you help us! I don't even have a license, so I can't drive So, I definitely won't be helpful! That's not true. Right? Yeah. But, I've never done farming! In fact, I'm an indoor person! It's alright! I'll teach you. It's okay right, Grandpa? Yeah. I'm okay if Mitsuomi says so. I didn't say I want to do it! Let's do it together, Mitsuomi! But... That's great! I'm so relieved. Morning. Oh, good morning, Mitsuomi! He came. Late on your first day? I still woke up early. I came because you guys asked me. Stop your complaining! You promised to do the job! Now, now, now! You guys made me promise. Here Mitsuomi! Your change of clothes. Thanks. Looking forward to working with you. Oh, Mitsuomi! It suits you! Right, Grandpa? Yeah. Alright, I'll let you help me here. Alright. Cut the branch that's close to the mandarin. Okay? If you cut the branch with the mandarin it will leave a mark on it... so, we won't be able to ship them. So, be careful with them. Okay. Got it? You got it? I got it. Mitsuomi! I told you to cut closer to the branch. Actually... why can't we pick them like this? Oh! We can't sell them like that. Hey, hey! We're counting on you! We'll avoid picking green and crooked shaped ones. We'll pick fifteen nicely shaped ones. That will be one pack. This time we'll gently snap them like this. Okay. Gently. I got it. Gently, Mitsuomi. I got it. Okay. In the pack... from the bottom we'll add them in twos three times. Then threes three times. Oh, Mitsuomi! Be more gentle. Snap. Okay. We're selling these. Be gentle. Got it. Like this. Whoa, a bee! Why is there a bee here? The bees bring out the shapes in the strawberries. There's more here too! Bees! Bees! Bees! Are you scared of bees, Mitsuomi? My back hurts. How long are we doing this? We'll cover all the way until there. What? We still have a long way to go. A long way to go. Hang in there, Mitsuomi. Alright, we'll finish here today. Yeah. I'm so tired! This is hard work! Pathetic, we've only done this much. Mitsuomi, are you okay? Ow, my back hurts. Good work. Yes, good work. Oh, you picked a lot. It hurts! You're not exhausted at all. I'm used to it. Hey. Yeah? When is your day-off? My day-off? If you don't have a day-off, your body will be all worn out. That may be impossible for a while. Have you heard of work-style reforms? Oh... After the greenhouse work is done, I could relax, but... right now, it's the busiest time of the year. See you tomorrow. As if I'll go Ugh! Jeez! Morning. Oh. Huh? I was about to give up but he actually came. See, I told you he'll show up. You're on dinner duty, Grandpa. I lost, it can't be helped. You guys had a bet on me? Mitsuomi, it's your fault! Huh? Mitsuomi, thank you for coming. Don't toy with me. Well, let's start working. Mitsuomi, we'll be counting on you again. Okay. Hang in there, Mitsuomi. After this, we'll do the deliveries. Okay. Grandpa, we're off to do deliveries. Okay, I'm counting on you both. Oh, if it isn't Yamato. Oh, Aunt Obotaro. Your mandarins are so delicious. I bought them today. Thank you for always buying them. Who's he? Right. He's helping us with the greenhouse. I'm Kozuka. Oh, Kozuka’s son. Weren't you working in Tokyo? I came back here last month. I see, so you're finally taking over the family business. Looking forward to it, right? See you. Take care. Thank you. I wonder why everyone tells me the same thing. Huh? Like I'm going to inherit after my Dad... or I came back to take over the family business. They're expecting a lot from you, Mitsuomi. Just so you know... my Dad doesn't want me to take over the business. Why? It's nothing. Huh? Hello? Kumai delivery! Oh, Yamato. Oh, today's your shift? Yeah. Oh, this is Ueda. My buddy from high school. Ueda, this is... Oh, I know you. My Dad told me the furniture dealer's son is back. You came back to take over the family business, right? Why are you helping Yamato? How's your dad? He's in Matsumoto. What? Somebody named Tenkakashi is here. Oh, your Dad does like music. He's pushing all the work onto me so he could play around. It doesn't hurt for you to tend the store once in a while. Why, you! Could you not talk like I slack off from work! But, it's true. Why, you! Yamato! What? Oh, could you place them there? Why you! We'll not accept your mandarins in our store. Stop it! Will you stop it! Whoa, Put me down, you stupid! Ow! Hey, what'll we do with the class reunion? You're organizing it? Yeah. It will be a problem if it's not lively while I'm in charge. Then, I'll contact as many people as I can. Yamato! You're a nice guy! We're buddies after all. See you later. Yeah. We're back! Oh. I'm tired. Take a bath and warm yourselves up. Okay. Hey! What the hell? It's alright! We're both men! Don't come in! It's so cold! You're surprisingly muscular. What? Really? Yeah. It's because I'm always lifting heavy things. Why did you decide to do it? What? It's tough, this job. Did Grandpa ask you to take over? I wanted to do it. There are tons of other jobs. I was raised in an orphanage. What? Grandpa asked me to be a part of the family. When I graduated high school, I became his adopted son. I love Grandpa. I respect him. That's why I wanted to do the same job as him. I wanted to get more work from him. Huh? Oh, nothing. How long are you both in there? Meals ready! Got it! Got it! Mitsuomi. Yeah? Your snaps have improved. For real? The mandarins are becoming more lovely. Well, it was worth it... betting on teaching a helping hand. A helping hand? It hasn't been too long since you've started. It's my words of gratitude. If you get carried away, you'll fall. It's okay, it's okay. Ah! Whoa! Mitsuomi! Y-You okay, Mitsuomi Thank you. Be careful! That was close. What did I tell you. Here we go. Here we go. Alright. Try it. It's so good! Right! Mitsuomi. Let's do our best tomorrow. Yeah. Alright. And here I thought you were so annoying. Hello? Mitsuomi? We'll take a break today. What? Grandpa has a farmers cooperative meeting. Then, we could both continue the work. I'll have to pick up the repaired farming equipment from Matsumoto. I see. Mitsuomi, take a break once in a while. Well, bye. Don't touch it. Is it your day-off? Lightly salted, huh? Consomme is better. That'll be 400 yen. Mitsuomi, What's your relationship with Yamato? Nothing. I'm just helping him out. You still seem to get along with him. Hey! Should I tell you about his secret? His secret? Do you wanna know? Not really. I don't want to know. Thank you for coming! Hey. What's Ueda like? Ueda? Yeah. Why? No, I just felt like asking. He's a nice guy. I see. During high school, we were always in the same class. Out of all my friends left in this town... He's definitely the one who gets me. We bought clothes and hung out together. Sometimes I don't know what he's thinking but... he's a really cool guy. I see. What? Mitsuomi, are you in a bad mood? I'm not. Why are you angry? I'm not angry. You're angry. Hey, you stupid! Don't touch me! Cheer up. Come on! come on! I'm not angry! You sure are! I'm not angry! Your face is angry! Grandpa? What was that? Grandpa? Grandpa?! Grandpa! Are you okay? Grandpa! Where abouts did you hit yourself? Your foot? Did you hit your foot? Mitsuomi! Call an ambulance! Right. Hang in there. Are you hurting? Are you okay? I told you to ask for my help with reaching high places. It's just a little fracture. Hospitalizing me is an exaggeration. When you grow older, your body heals slower. Don't push yourself. I'm stronger than a bean sprout like you. Who are you calling bean sprout. There's still some work left over, right? But... Seeing you two won't magically heal my foot. I'll be okay. Go home. Grandpa was mean for calling me a bean sprout. Well, it's a relief he didn't hit his head. I'm so relieved. If something happened to him I... You're exaggerating. If he has the energy to talk, it means he's well. But, I only have Grandpa. He's my family. I'm home. Oh. What's with the drawer? I was asked to fix it. Could it be fixed? Of course it can. The wood is alive. I see. I heard Grandpa Kumai is hospitalized. Oh, yeah. But, it's not too serious. I see. Well, be of support to Yamato. Okay. He seems lively, but, Grandpa is already old. He could take a break once in a while. Dad, you're also getting old. Shouldn't you be worried about yourself. Speak for yourself. Think carefully about your future. I know. See you. Thanks for visiting. Huh? Oh, Mitsuomi! Are you guys going somewhere? For an examination. If you don't mind, could you wait over there? That's right, this is from my Mom. It's Ohagi (Bean cake). Yoshiko’s Ohagi (bean cake). Grandpa loves her Ohagi (bean cake). Well, we'll be off. He seems lively but, Grandpa Kumai is already old. If something happened to him... the land will be left to Yamato. I understand it's troublesome to find an inheritor but he doesn't have to leave it to his adopted son. He doesn't have a choice. Yamato does have sociable manners. Even so, we don't know what he's actually thinking. He's bound to do something bad. Oh, piss off! Huh? What the hell do you know about him?! You guys know nothing about him! Don't go making assumptions when you guys know nothing about him! Yamato is not that kind of guy! What's with you?! Watch your mouth when you talk to others! Don't look down on your elders! Who do you think you are?! Listen, he is- Mitsuomi! Let it go, Mitsuomi. What's going on here? Are you still angry? That doesn't bother me. Why are you getting all angry about it? Doesn't it piss you off at all? I'm used to it. Don't get used to it! But... Just so you know... I'm pissed off at you too! Don't you have any pride?! Pride? Don't go smiling while you're being made fun of! Got it. I feel stupid for making a fuss by myself. Thank you. For getting angry as if it was about you. It was nothing, I... Mitsuomi! Hey! Thank you, Mitsuomi! Get off! I don't want to! Get off! I don't want to! I'm going to suffocate! I don't want to! Hey! Get off! Tickle, tickle! Stop it! I give up! I give up! Mitsuomi! You're late! I told you we're picking strawberries today! Did you go to the wrong greenhouse? My bad. It seems I have a bit of a cold. Huh? That's not good. Do you have a fever? I d-don't have a fever. That's right, last night... When did you go- Oh, should I cover this side? What? Okay... I-I got it. Mitsuomi! What? I told you to pick them more gently. Ah! What's the matter with you today? Are you okay? Sorry. Mitsuomi! What? I'll cover this area, so you pick the leaves over there. Okay. Yamato? Oh, Ueda! Hey. I heard Grandpa is hospitalized. I came to help you out. Thank you. I wonder if I'll get sunburnt... even though I brought sunscreen. You put sunscreen on during winter? It's common sense to prevent skin-damage. What do you want me to do? Right. Then, I want you to pack those strawberries. Okay. Here Oh, okay. You're a real help Wow, they look so good! Be gentle with them. Hey! Pack them gently! The sweetness is not too bad. I'm sorry, it's nothing. Did something happen? You could share your troubles. Hey, Grandpa... When do you usually kiss someone? Huh? When you're not lovers, is there that kind of kiss? Like those dramas where the parent kisses their sleeping child. Did you kiss someone? Uh... Did you find someone you like? It's not like that... There's no need to feel embarrassed! You're still young. You could kiss once, twice, thrice- I told you it's not like that. It's not like that. Mitsuomi! Could you come down. Yeah? What do you think? What do I think? It's getting close to that age so I thought she would be suitable. No, I have no interest in arranged marriage or marriage in general. Not you! I'm talking about Yamato! What? You're unemployed! I can't arrange a marriage for you! Don't say "unemployed" towards your son. The constitution is simple. Could you ask Yamato? Me? If I ask him, I would come across too formal. I want him to casually meet her. Grandpa Kumai is already old. There's no telling whether he'll have another incident like before. If Yamato finds someone, Grandpa will be so relieved. But still... Yamato decides if he accepts it or not. At least consider my suggestion. Ugh! My back hurts! Sorry. Let's call it a day. My arms are killing me. Hey. Do you have time tonight? Tonight? Yeah. Just between us, I have something to tell you. Okay. Good work! Cheers! Cheers! I didn't invite you. I told you it was only between us. This is so good! Mitsuomi, Ueda... Thank you. You guys really helped me. At least invite me if you're going to celebrate! You're so cold, Mitsuomi. That's not what I meant. Excuse me! Yes! I'll have a moriyama set... Yes. And a motsubasashi. What did you want to talk about? Yes, one moment please. A matchmaking for you. A matchmaking?! My Mom got asked by her friend. She wanted me to ask you. She's a twenty-seven year old nurse. Not bad. See. I heard she's a really nice person. I shouldn't say this. I'm sorry. Can you apologize to your Mom for me. Well, she was just being noisy. Thank you! Well, marriage is quick here in the countryside. Like our mate, Murase got married last month. What? Really? Yeah. I heard Morimoto is also getting married. Yoshiyoka already has two kids. That sounds nice. I want to get married too! Right, Mitsuomi? Yeah, maybe someday. Huh? I want to get married by thirty. What about you, Yamato? I'm good. Huh? I've decided not to. Why? Toilet. Another wall. A wall? Yeah. How should I say this... he has a wall around him He occasionally closes himself off. Earlier, you told me you know his secret. So you wanna know after all. He's dating a woman. What? He meets up with her at Usa restaurant. I saw them together a few times. I'd say she's older than him. She was pretty fine. You said he has a wall around him. Yeah? Having that while dating a woman, isn't that contradicting? That's why! He's a mystery. Sorry about it since you've generously suggested a matchmaking. Grandpa, you knew about it? I heard it from your mother. I wonder if he has a girlfriend. Huh? I wonder if Yamato is dating someone. I don't know if he's dating someone but... it seems he has kissed someone. Kissed? I wonder if I could hold my grandchild soon. Alright, let's go! Yeah. Hey. Yeah? How much was the hospital fee? Grandpa, don't worry about it. Let's go. Slowly, slowly. We're almost there grandpa. We're here, we're here. While you were gone grandpa... Mitsuomi did a great job. I see. Right, Mitsuomi? That's a real help. Ryoko is here! One, two, one, two, one, two. We're home! Welcome back! You came! I heard you were discharged! You guys came pretty late. It was very busy. Congratulations on your discharge! I'm sorry for making you worry. Not at all. Nice to meet you, I'm Shikano. I'm Kozuka. I'll help! Here we go. Ryoko, you did our laundry?! There were so many piled up. You should wash it while there's less. You even washed our underwear! There's no need to feel embarrassed by showing your underwear. You had dinner? Are you going to eat here? But I'll be home late. It's okay once in a while! Stay for a while, Ryoko Right. Then... just a bit longer. Then, I... should get going. What? Thank you, Mitsuomi. Mitsuomi?! Mitsuomi! Mitsuomi! You promised we'll celebrate Grandpa's discharge. I'm sorry, I remembered I had plans. Plans? What for? What's wrong, Mitsuomi?! Nothing's wrong! Is something wrong? I wonder if Mitsuomi plans to continue working for Grandpa Kumai. They even joked around saying "Did Mitsuomi get adopted too?" at the women's association. At least he has a job and isn't roaming around. That's true but... Dear, are you okay with it? Don't you want him to take over the family business? Do you know what type of wood this is? Keyaki (Zelkova wood) How many years do you think I've been working in this town? They may be the same type but... each of them are different in their own way. Touching it. Smelling it. Talking to it. Turning it into a wonderful drawer. From the first cut to the second... You devote your heart into this work. Do you really believe... he feels the same way about this job? Yamato Thank you. For what? For helping us with the greenhouse. It was nothing... I barely helped. Yeah, true. Shut up! Where are we going? Don't worry, follow me. Ryoko! Thanks for waiting. Nice to meet you the other day. Nice to meet you. This is Ryoko’s husband. And this is Taku. Husband? Yeah. Mitsuomi, I think there was a misunderstanding. Hello, I'm Shikan. Taku, say hello. Hello. Uh... Taku, there's a goat over there. A goat? Ready, set, go! Hey! Gooaaat! Wait a minute! Goat! Maa! Maa! Mitsuomi! There's a Goat! I'm not going! What? You two get along. How long have you known each other? We've just met recently. Is that so? How long have you known him I believe twenty years. That long? Yamato didn't tell you? We were raised in the same orphanage. What? We were living together at the orphanage until I was adopted. We're like siblings. Is that so? Were you worried? Huh? Did you think an older woman was flirting with him? No, not at all. The other day, you were giving me the death stare. Mitsuomi! Goat! I told you, I'm not going! What am I, a child? I'm so relieved He's got a good friend. Yamato is always smiling. But, he isn't. He does that on purpose. People usually ask what's wrong when a person looks sad or in pain but... They don't ask when someone seems happy. Does that mean... he's actually hurting? He puts on a happy face to create a barrier around him. He doesn't want to let people in. It seems a child raised without his parents doesn't know how to give love back. When receiving kindness, he doesn't know what to do with it. I was like that too. You end up creating a wall around yourself. My wall, he broke it for me. I wish Yamato could meet someone like that soon. Thanks for waiting. Here, here. This is the address. I've contacted the customer both of you will be delivering it. Got it. I'm sorry when you have work. Don't worry about it. Besides, is Uncle okay? It's just a strained back. Then, let's go. Yes, I'm counting on you both. Be careful. Wait! Actually, I'll... Dear! Get some rest. Uncle, it's best not to push yourself today. I'm sorry for bringing you along. No worries, no worries. It's out of the question to have my dad deliver with his condition. He cares so he couldn't help it He has worked so hard on his job. That's strange. We should have turned right on the last road. You said left. You thought so too. It's because you seemed so confident about it. I didn't say that! Did too! Oh, hey! Is there Mizushima’s house around here? Mizushima? We have a delivery for Mizushima. That's my house. Please have some tea. Wow, it's fixed! It sure is. Thank you for coming all this way. Not at all. Hope you didn't get lost. Yes, we somehow made it. My Dad couldn't make it because of a strained back. He wanted me to give you his best regards. Here you are. Thank you. She is going to get married soon. I want her to have this drawer. Is that so? While I was about to get married, I brought this drawer here. I had your grandfather make it for me. Your grandfather made it while your father fixed it. The next time we have it fixed... You may be fixing it for us. Thanks. They seemed very happy. When we get back, tell your dad about it. Mitsuomi? I used to hate my dad's job. I said it was "lame and boring." I also said it was ’’old-fashioned." I went to Tokyo because I wanted to do something cool and interesting. But, I couldn't find anything. Back at the company, I was called a useless human being. Just earlier, I remembered something. When I was a child, I would go into my dad's workplace. It was filled with the nice smell of wood. I could hear the sound of chisel and plane. I was fascinated by seeing drawers and dining tables being made. I was always watching my dad work. I... Your thoughts, you should tell him how you really feel. Is your back okay? I'm sorry about today. They were so happy with the drawer. I see. Dad... What is it? Actually, I... I want to be a furniture craftsman. I want to take over the family business. There you go, making suggestions again. I told you, I have no intention of leaving it to you. It's not a suggestion. I know. I've been arrogant and said a lot of things. I blamed everyone when things didn't go well. I kept running away. I'm fully aware of my wrong actions. But, I don't want to remain as a no good person! I want to change! I also... want to make people happy with my job. I want to be like you. Please... Teach me your ways. Please! First, You must sharpen your chisel and plane! Got it? Yes! Yamato! Mitsuomi! What's wrong? He said yes! What? My Dad said yes! What! That's great! What's great? Grandpa! My Dad said I could take over the business. Well, that's great to hear! Give it your best! Yeah. Become a good furniture craftsman, Mitsuomi. That's great! Your father now has a good inheritor. I'm looking forward to your work! Grandpa, can I have a moment? Yeah. I'm heading to Tokyo tomorrow. Tokyo? The government office in Kameido. I see. I'll have to take a day-off from work. It's alright, go ahead. Good night. Yamato. Thank you for coming to this house. Grandpa... Thank you. It's so cold. Sorry for bringing you out this early. That's okay, but where are we going? I have to face something properly. I was... an abandoned child. I've heard I was found in Tokyo but... I don't know anything about my parents. My parent is Grandpa. That's why, I haven't taken the time to search for them. But, I thought maybe I'll reach a conclusion... or draw the line. After seeing you recently. I've decided to move forward. If I'm with you, Mitsuomi... I think I could go for it. Whoa, it's the sky tree! You're definitely a countrysider. It's my first time seeing it. It's so tall! Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm sorry. Did I make him angry? Don't worry about it. But... It happens a lot here. Let's go. Okay. I will leave this to you. I will take that. It will take some time to prepare the dismissal copy. So, would you mind waiting for a while? Yes. I do apologize, please have a seat. Visitor 33 please come forward to the counter. It's going to take a while. I see. If you find your parents, would you visit them? I don't know. Do you want to see them? I don't know. I see. I have to say... It feels weird to have you sitting on my right side. You're always on my left. I was thinking the same thing. You did? Yeah. Yeah, I definitely prefer this side. Right? It's going to be okay. Yeah. I didn't think it would take until tomorrow. Going through all those paper work must be a hassle. How can I say, am I relieved? I'm sorry, you have to tag along for another day. It's alright. Let's grab a bite and find a hotel. Excuse me, can we stay for the night? Welcome. Two guests? Yes. Which room would you like to choose? Together is fine, right? It's just the two of us. Double is fine, right? What? You stupid! We're obviously picking twin beds! Doubles are for... I do apologize, our twin rooms are all full. We only have a double room available for two guests. What? Then, we'll go with that. Yes, please fill in your details. Great. Why are you all the way to the corner? So you don't kick me. Do I toss around that much? You're like a child. That night I stayed at your place too... Hey. Yeah? That night, why... did you kiss me? You... knew about it? I always thought what that was all about. Well, that was... Sorry. I guess if I asked you'll feel troubled. It's because I like you. What? It's because I like you. Does that mean... what you've just said? That's right. I'm a guy, though. I know that. I think so too. "What's so great about liking a guy." "Why is it you?" But, I can't help it. I fell for you. I once got confessed to. I didn't hate her. I thought she was a really nice person. But, I couldn't be with her. I don't have the confidence to like someone. I'm scared to. Yeah? Please give me more time. Okay. Can I hug you? Don't ask after you do it. You're right. Yamato As expected, nothing was written on it. Now, I feel so refreshed. Excuse me - Yes? Is Tsubaki Park close from here? A park? It seems I was picked up from there. I want to go there but is that okay? Of course Excuse me. I remembered while listening to your conversation... that I was also there when you were picked up. You were sleeping on a bench wrapped around in a new towel. There was a name written on a note between the towel. It read "Yamato." My name. I thought someone from the government office or the orphanage gave me that name. I wonder why they bothered to name me when they were going to abandon me anyway. Names are firstly given to us by our parents, right? It's like receiving a first gift by our parents. If they had no love for you, they probably wouldn't have thought up a name for you. Yamato. Could you say it again? Yamato. Yamato. Isn't it amazing? All around the world, There are so many people with moms and dads. That's true. I wonder if my parents are out there somewhere. I wish them all the happiness. Because I'm currently happy. I wonder if I can love someone too.
