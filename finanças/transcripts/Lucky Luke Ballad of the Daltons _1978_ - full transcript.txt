Hey, get lost! Let him sing! We want the dancers! Let him sing! No, I prefer the dancers! Get on with it! Sing! My friends let us sing of a new adventure... ...of the minstrel, defender of the law. For Lucky Luke and his proud steed... ...will accomplish some fabulous deeds. At a slow trot, justice is on the way. The baddies should be nervous... their time will soon be up. First the anxiety and then a total rout. The lot! This is the ballad... the ballad of the Daltons. This is not fair! Open the door! I've been sentenced too! I've the right to be in prison! Through Lucky Luke, the Daltons are locked up. Good and honest people can sleep in peace. The guard for this odious bunch... ...is the famous, the astonishing Rantanplan. Keep your eyes on that nasty bunch... It could be that they're cooking up in secret... ...one of their clever dirty tricks. This is the ballad, the ballad of the Daltons. Lucky Luke! Lucky Luke! Lucky Luke! Hey Joe, don't throw a tantrum! Don't throw a tantrum, Joe! When I get out, I'll bump off Lucky Luke! That'll have to wait. Till we've done our 4,200 years of hard labour. With 3 meals a day, we'll be huge! You idiot, I'll...! Hey Daltons... go to the visiting room! The visiting room? Who wants to talk to us? We don't know anyone. We don't want to see anyone. We know Lucky Luke. He talks to us sometimes. Lucky Luke! Just let me at him! Where is he? Where is he? I'm over here. Allow me to introduce myself... Augustus Betting. Attorney, at your service. Are you gentlemen the Daltons? I'm Joe, and this is William. And he's Jack. Exactly. So that must make me Averell. Averell, that's right... I bring you two pieces of news. One painful and one pleasant one. Let's start with the painful if you don't mind. I must inform you of the death of your uncle Henry Dalton. Uncle Henry is dead? I must say that we didn't know much about him. He's been held up to us as an example. He had an irresistible personality. Nothing resisted him... Banks, stagecoaches, trains... How did he die? Hanged. "Natural causes." That's a consolation. Here's the last picture of him. It must make you happy. - He looked like Daddy. - He was a handsome man. And the pleasant news? Before leaving this world... ...he made his will. He has named you all as sole heirs. You mean we get all his loot? Good on you, Uncle Henry! Yes, but there is a condition. You must become the instrument of his revenge. Please explain. Henry Dalton wants you... ...to eliminate the jurors and the judge who condemned him. You will inherit, after completing this... ...formality. Just have to wipe out a pack of coyotes? Give me the names and prepare the inheritance. Your uncle, wanting to be sure it's done... ...has named someone to observe the operations. It's only on his testimony that I will deliver the very large sum... ...that he's leaving you. OK, OK! Who gets to watch us? The only honest man that your uncle knew. A man named Lucky Luke. Lucky Luke! Lucky Luke! Ah! Lucky Luke! Calm down! Calm down! Here is the list of people that you must get rid of. If you are not successful, the fortune of Henry Dalton... ...will go to charity. We'll capture Lucky Luke. We'll take him with us when we knock off these guys. If he refuses? We'll offer him a share of the inheritance. That's not fair! He was our uncle. Let him hang his own uncle! Hey, yeah! But as soon as we have the inheritance... ...we eliminate Lucky Luke! If he's eliminated, he can't get his share! - That's right... I'll explain... - We haven't got time. Got to escape. Got your picks? So let's go... We're gonna dig a tunnel. Joe, did you say a tunnel? There are 4 of us! If there's only one tunnel, we'll draw straws! We'll all go out through the same tunnel! We haven't got far, have we! One tunnel! One for all! All for one! We should have drawn a plan, Joe. You just have to continue to dig straight ahead. I was the 1st and you're all in front of me. We must be on the other side of the wall. You just have to dig upwards. We're on the surface, but it's dark. It must be nighttime. I've got a match. Joe, we're in the explosives shed! Warden... we've sounded the alarm... The Daltons are missing. No loss of human life. Yes, but Rantanplan has also disappeared. Gentlemen... Let us salute the most faithful and noble of our deputies. We admired his intelligence, his instinct pushed to the point of perfection. Gentlemen, let's salute the memory of Rantanplan... fallen, or rather exploded... ...victim only to his sense of duty. The prison! Where is the prison? The prison is gone. Someone stole the prison. Joe, I was right. It really was the explosives shed! It seems to me that those people are from the prison. They may be thieves. I will follow them. Joe, we're being followed. That prison dog is following us. Rantanplan? No danger, he's an idiot. Make as if he wasn't there. What do we do now? We need weapons to capture Lucky Luke. Where would we find them in this wilderness? I don't know. We must fulfill Uncle Henry's last wishes. Uncle Henry... looking at us from below. He will help us. Hallelujah! Revolvers! Get your revolvers! Revolvers! Get your revolvers! Buy my revolvers! Beautiful revolvers! We're going to need 4 revolvers. You're in luck! I have the quality articles. Very accurate weapons. With them, not even an idiot can miss his target. This is just what we need, eh Joe?! Averell, shut up! Are they loaded? Yes, and the belts are a bonus. They're 12 dollars each. - So that's 37 dollars. - More like 52. Nothing at all. Scram! So they're accurate? Yes, even idiots... Averell, shut up! It's the same every time! I'll have to retrain. I'll sell something else. Horses! You don't get shot at with them! That's Tobias Wills, the gun dealer who's always moaning. And how! I've been attacked with my own merchandise. By 4 guys, near Ben Gulch. 4 guys? There's one called Joe and the other Averell. They had like a family resemblance. - The Daltons. - The Daltons? They were blown up in the prison explosion. - There was nothing left of them. - They were ghosts? I was attacked by ghosts. Ghosts! Ghosts or not, I'll go take a look. These 2 pairs should be right for you. It's lightweight which you will find useful. It's always like that... They don't buy anything. With the mares, it's worse. Hear that? A horseman! Hide! Here, boy! Come here you stupid dog! Here, Rantanplan! Rantanplan! You survived the explosion! What are you doing in the middle of the road? You're hurt? What does this guy want from me? He has a face like a prison thief too. You wouldn't have seen the Daltons, would you? The Daltons are here! Hands up, coyote! We have a surprise for you, cowboy! We won't shoot you down. On the contrary, we have a business proposition for you. Let's hear the diabolical plot... ...of these scoundrels enticing our hero. These dreadful types would like so much... ...to bribe him with a share of the pot! There's no excuse at all for such a fall from grace. For the money, has Lucky Luke lost his mind? But in his bag, he has some tricks up his sleeve. That's the ballad, the ballad of the Daltons. Refuse, and we'll blow you away. Accept, and you'll get your share of the inheritance. Well then, cowboy... what do you say? If I get a share, okay. I'll be a witness. To prove my good will... ...I'll help you eliminate those coyotes. That would truly amaze me. 1st on the list is named Ming Li Foo. He has a shop in Grass City. Joe, when are we eating? - I'm hungry. - Shut up! We need horses. Yes, horses are good! Horses for sale! The ghosts! The ghosts are back! He was really afraid of us! You're terrifying! Try not to forget it, cowboy! This must be Grass City, here. Yes. And here is our customer. I'll go in alone, I'll kill him. Do you take us for suckers? We don't trust you. We only ask you to be a witness. Nice! Noble foreigner drink water from washing clothes. What? It's not a Chinese restaurant here? No. Chinese laundry. As my sign says. Allow me to say that you have need of my services. If you would like to entrust me with your clothes. We're not here for that! You're one of the people who judged Uncle Henry. Hey, no! Our clothes have indeed a need of a little cleaning. I don't get it, Joe. Why didn't we shoot him? Our clothes needed washing. We'll finish him off when they're ready. The Chinaman will have worked for us for free. Joe, you've got a great sense of humour! Look, here he is. - Are they ready? - Not yet. One must be patient, noble clients. Hey! He's leaving! Go after him! You can't run out like that. People will look at you. Oh... very well... You're dressed. You chase him! We'll look for some clothes. Ming Li Foo, wait! Listen to me. I just want to talk. I just want... I'm going to need your help. What are those two up to? Where's the Chinaman? He's joined his ancestors. - I'd like to check. - He's dead! Let's go! My shot roused the town! The laundryman's been killed! Get the killer! Get the killer! Get the killer! Get the killer! What's happened to my 4 guys in stripes? Never mind, I'll follow those others. We need clothes, we can't stay like this. Flowers don't suit me... They make me fat. I'm sure there'll be a shop in the next town. No more selling on the road. Too many bad people out there. Here are the first customers. There we are... I'm ready! It's us again! Oh, there it is! - Is it a prison? - Yes. The 2nd juror, Thadeus Collins, is a prison warden. If we go back in, they won't let us out. It wasn't worth escaping! We can go in without being seen... ...by digging a tunnel. It's not possible, Joe. To get out of prison, we know what to do... We don't know how to get in. You're right, Averell. You can go in there, cowboy. Go into the prison and get the warden to come out. When he comes out, we'll shoot him. OK. I can kill him in the prison. No! Get him out here. I insist! To each his own work, and this guy will be well guarded. Anyone home? Anyone home? Anyone home? Thadeus Collins, warden of the prison? I am no longer prison warden. There is no more prison. But it looks like a prison. Except that there are no more prisoners. Without prisoners, it is a meal without cheese. A child without a mother's love. A rose without perfume. It is no longer a prison. Where are your prisoners? Escaped! They all escaped! We were like a family here. I thought of them all as my children. I pampered them. And I find they're just ungrateful people! Come and see, stranger! Come and see! They dug tunnels everywhere. They even bribed the guards... ...who helped them dig. I sacked the guards. The last prisoners had to dig on their own. Serves them right! Now it just remains for me to take my luggage and go. Are you going out the door? It's not usual here, but... I'll explain. Is there a tunnel here? Yes, under the carpet. There! The prisoner who was my housekeeper, dug it. A man who had my full confidence. That's why you will go out this way. They're taking their time to get out of prison! Think so? It took our daddy 40 years. Thank you, Lucky Luke. One thing in particular hurts me. The thought that another will have this office... ...and that he'll be the new warden here. There'll be no other warden in this prison. Here's Lucky Luke! But he's on his own. Where's the warden? He refused to come out. He doesn't want to abandon his post. So what do we do? He says, if we want to get him out, we'll have to blow up the prison. I have an idea. We blow up the prison and the warden. That's a great idea, Joe! Where do we find what we need? We need dynamite and shovels. Dynamite and shovels! Dynamite and shovels! Funny sort of merchant! We can never talk to him. When he sees a customer, he runs away. Enough talk... Get to work! I think we're there. - The dynamite is in place? - Yes, Joe. I took a long fuse to ignite it from the outside. - Do you have it, Jack? - You had it, Joe. I don't know where it is. Find it in the dark! Joe, I have a match. You succeeded. I searched everywhere. There is nothing left. The warden has disintegrated. They've started again... They've stolen another prison. Incorrigible! They are incorrigible! The 3rd juror is called "Serpent Feather". He's an Indian medicine man. He lives in the 'Desert of Thirst'. The 'Desert of Thirst'?! It'd be worse if it was the 'Desert of Hunger'. Here the grass of the prairie is green... ...where streams flow among the flowers. Let's take a walk past pretty springs.... ...in this enchanting land of Eden. But watch out when you reach the boundary... Beware of the desert, branded by Satan. Poor birds taken down as if cooked in an oven... That's the ballad, the ballad of the Daltons. More dead than alive, a fossil appears... A rider who was stopped in full gallop... Brave pioneer in this hostile desert... ...you have found a relaxing job. Only the bad guys, with heads full of hatred... ...are totally crazy when others give up... ...on facing this ruthless wasteland. This is the ballad, the ballad of the Daltons. Oh, it's not getting any better! Someone's stolen all the decor. Hey, do you have any water left? No, I told you that we wouldn't have enough. Joe, you should have listened to him. We're thirsty, Joe! Listen to him? He's not the boss. Forget about water... Think of something else. Sing! It's drinking, drinking. drinking... It's drinking that we need! Averell! Shut up! We've arrived. Serpent Feather! You wait! Me in bath. In his bath! What do palefaces want? Even in desert, when we in bath... ... someone comes to front door. We are thirsty. Drink! One moment. You helped to condemn Henry Dalton? - How! - We're gonna shoot you down! - We're thirsty, Joe! - Joe, we're thirsty. Let's fix this. We'll plug him, then get some water. You kill me, you not drink. Here 'Desert of Thirst'. You mad, if you think you find water here. But what about the bath? Me medicine man. My magic powerful. You kill me, you not have water. Water come from magic. Give us a drink, then we'll blow you away. That seems reasonable to me. That, very reasonable. You wait. Paleface not thirsty? Yeah, but I want to talk to you first. No offense, red brother, but I don't trust that water. Paleface have brain under scalp... ...and not be wrong to nurture mistrust. Now, terracotta face... You... you... you will... Mushroom dust in water. Mushrooms? I have very humid cellar. So... would paleface like cold beer? Lemonade, ice cream soda? What will the mushroom dust do to them? Just sweet dreams. Leave us plenty time to talk. Listen... dream started. Averell, shut up! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe, you OK? - Serpent Feather? - You wasted him. - Don't you remember? - Er... yes. Yes. Nothing more to do here. You're right, cowboy. Stand up, boys! For the return, I've fixed things with Serpent Feather. He said that we wouldn't run out of water. - What a climate! - You never know what to wear. When do we eat? Chihuahua! Your finger, Pancho? - He bit me, Carmen! - The dog did? Not the dog, Caramba! The biggest of the five guys! Must quickly withdraw hand in front of him. Hey, boss...! There's a Dr Aldous Smith in this part of the world. El Doctor Smith? Si, know him well. He went through here, to the north. You will catch up with him. OK, let's go. Senor. - The bill. - I'll take care of it. OK, if it amuses you to pay for something. You know Dr Smith? Yes, very well. He's a friend. He is a bit, how to put it, Senor... A bit of a quack. He doesn't hurt anyone. In his bottles, it's just water. Except his personal bottle. It is the tequila that I make. The doctor can't stand water. You coming, cowboy? Coming! - Want to try? - Another time. Adios amigo! Cheers, boy! When we reach the staging post, I'll give you a swig. There should be some suckers there. Are you Dr Smith? At your service, Sir. I see by your haste that you are in need of me. Good. Now listen! You're very fortunate. I have diplomas from European and local universities. I have what will restore your strength and health. From where I stand... ...your health would seem to be... ...please don't be offended... ...in poor condition. You have severe symptoms of degeneration. With the naked eye... ... I see you have a sick liver, a deficient stomach... ...dull eyes, weak lungs, slack muscles. Big guy! You there! The state of your brain is very disturbing. As for that animal looking vaguely like a dog... ...it seems to be a good example... ...of Mother Nature's audacious sense of humour. It could have been tragic... ...but look, I am here for you. I am an inventor... a benefactor of humanity... ...who, after many studious years, has found an elixir. Will you shut up! This elixir heals men as well as animals. This elixir is right here! I don't sell it for 100, or 50 or 20... I sell it for only 5 dollars. Not for profit... ...but to continue that research... ...from which humanity will benefit. If you won't listen to me... Wait, Joe. I feel poorly. That elixir... I feel weak, too. - Let's take the elixir... - Out of the question! Even though I don't feel well myself. What's in this bottle? No, that's not for sale. - It's dangerous? - Very... Poisonous? Yes, very poisonous! Extremely potent. It would kill a tribe of Apaches, a whole troop of cavalry... ...or one Irishman. I feel it coming, Joe. What? That's a diabolical idea you have there. - I do? - Yeah. Make him drink that stuff, to save a bullet. And teach him a lesson. Yeah, hear that, boys? A diabolical idea. I've lots of them like that. Drink your poison, you quack! My poison? But why? You were on the jury panel that hanged Uncle Dalton. That's why! Drink it... or I'll waste a bullet! I've no choice but to obey! A man of science will disappear, a victim of ignorance! I take this opportunity to tell a little of my life... Drink it! Alright... The quest for gold devours the greedy man. It's the stampede, the carnival of illusion. The sheer bare sides of the arid hills... ...mostly produce stone and disappointment. From around the world, we rush in a frenzy... ...as if the bait of riches has harpooned us... ...we citizens of every race. This is the ballad, the ballad of the Daltons. Do you know Tom O'Connor? Yes, he's on that hill over there. He never found gold... ...despite digging up the whole hill. It drove him crazy. He shoots anyone who approaches. We haven't seen him for ages. We don't want to be dead. Tom O’Connor is the next juror. Let's go! The entrance to his mine is not welcoming. Be careful. I'll go first. I'll go... I'm the boss. Of course, but it won't be you. Look at Rantanplan! Lemme see... It's undoubtedly a game. What am I supposed to do? One thing they always enjoy... I'll show off. Think about it, cowboy... He gets full marks as a scout. O'Connor! O'Connor! O'Connor! Don't move! You shot at my rifle? Smart of you... you bent the barrel. Let's end it! I want to talk to you. We've not much time. What's he doing? Is he doing the killing himself? That would be annoying. He has to be the witness. And I want to knock him off myself. Look, Joe! Where is O'Connor? I went into the mine, but I saw no one. That rifle was floating in the air and fired on its own. - What? - That's what happened. It's not natural. I don't like it. He might be right. The guy down there said they hadn't seen O'Connor for ages. He could be dead. Bullshit! He disappeared into the mine, seeing us arrive. Let's chase him! Are you coming, cowboy? No, I'm not going. I fight against desperadoes... ...not against what I don't understand. I fought against what I didn't understand. Forget it, Averell. He's just chicken. Wait for us down there, you piece of trash. We're going looking for O'Connor. Will you be going into the unknown in this wagon? Wagon? Yeah! Good idea. Climb in! How about I stay with him? To keep an eye on him. Get on board! They'll be taking a ride they'll never forget. I laid the rails myself. Perfect. You'll have time to prepare our little scenario. Go to it! Ah! Who dares to disturb my eternal rest? We don't want to disturb you, Mr Ghost. We're looking for Tom O'Connor. And what do you want with him? Oh, nothing... We just want to rub him out, if you don't mind. It's already done. I am Tom O'Connor. I died in my quest for gold. Unfortunately for you, you can't kill a ghost. On the other hand, I'll take you with me to the Devil's Mines. Go on, pick it up. Pick it up! What does this guy want with me? Like that, you stupid dog. You finished him off? He's finished. You can swear to it. I'll take your word for it. I see you for 100 dollars. Three-of-a-kind. Four aces. - Whadda you want? - Information. We're looking for a guy called Sam Game. He's regular here. Sam the card sharp? He doesn't come here anymore. He was convinced to get off the game. He saw the light and repented. Now he's Reverend Sam. He's the preacher in the church down the street. What can I get you? What's that ace? That's the 5th in the game! - Thank you! - Cheerio! Come on, Rantanplan! Hallelujah! As we follow our shepherd... ...who drives his bison towards the empty cowshed... ...around the best table with its green baize cover. Hallelujah! The games are done with. Is it with marked cards, my sisters... ...that you will win in eternal poker? Even with 4 aces in hand... ...the Evil One can produce a royal flush. ...from his satanic sleeves... ...and bring about... Sam Game! I have 2 words to say to you. Quiet! - Silence! - Sit down! But... but... Sit down! Hats! Hats! As I was saying, dear brothers and sisters... Pride is a full house... aces and kings. But it can be beaten... ...by the more modest four sevens. Bet on modesty and virtue... ...and you will pocket the fattest pots. Amen! OK... now! Sit down! Now let's have a game of lotto. Remember, each card is worth 5 dollars. The money will go to the good works of my parish. Miss Worthlesspenny, distribute the cards! Two! Eighteen! Twenty six! That's it! I won! It's extraordinary. You always win, Reverend. It's a miracle! Oh, heaven truly protects you! Hallelujah! In the lucky breaks of life... ...whoever plays against a loser always wins. And who dreams of building castles in the air. Hallelujah shepherd, and we thank you. Hallelujah! I shall welcome you all next Sunday. Thanks to your good souls, we shall play roulette. Go in peace. I have two words for you. Get out of the way, he's mine! If you steal the collection box, it will be a mortal sin. Let's play dice... double or quits. Shut up! You are Sam Game, who condemned Henry Dalton? I'm here to eliminate you. I'm going to do it... You wait outside. No way! Say your prayers, preacher! But Joe... Don't quarrel, dear brothers. I'll stand before the Great Croupier up there... I entrust my soul at His divine roulette wheel. I just ask for a favour. Let me play one last time... - At what? - Russian roulette. One bullet in the cylinder. I'll start again until I lose. Okay? Let him do it... It's so moving! I bet 10 dollars that he loses first time. Okay, but be quick about it! I'll make sure it succeeded. I have to testify. Hurry up! I want to avoid those female parishioners. Don't worry, the bullet was a blank. A miracle! I would have bet on it. Me too, my brother. Stop. It's here! What, Joe? There's nothing here. Yes, there's that! The next juror is Bud Bugman, engine driver. He drives the train going from Flagstaff Bend to Rocky Terminal. It goes along here. Let's wait for it. - Joe! - Yeah? How will you stop the train? By barricading with trees. There are no trees or stones around here. - We blow up a bridge. - There isn't any. So we'll build one. We have to derail the train. We've never derailed a train before. Easy. Do what I say. Heave... Ho.. Heave... ho! Couldn't we just bend a single rail? Probably. With two, we double our chances of success. Fair enough. I think it's coming. Are you Bud Bugman? Yes, but it's not the right moment. I want to stop this train. On the contrary, go faster! You are crazy! Do what I say! OK. Walt, put the logs on! But Bud, we'll be killed! If you don't obey, he'll shoot me. That's worse! Pepe! There's a dog, running like crazy. Why's he doing that, Juan? That would take too long to explain to you, Pepe. Better to go on with our siesta. This trip is going to end badly. Keep going! I need to talk to you. Slope arms! Right! Lieutenant, designate 6 men to fix that. Did you see a train go by? The train is ours! I've missed a train before, but never had a train miss me! Stop! Where is the driver, Bud Bugman? It was him or me. He wanted to throw me off the train. This desperado killed Bud! Then pushed him off the train. Arrest him! Whoever you might be... Good, let's be on our way! Bud, we fooled them, eh? Don't blow your nose in my cap! Good morning, you little rascal! It's him. Mathias Bones, the last juror. I'm killing him. Joe, it's always you or Lucky Luke. Never us! Yes, it's the last juror. Our last chance to have fun. That would be nice to put him down together, as a family. Good idea, for once. It's a good idea! Don't shoot him down here. I know this Tumble Weed Springs. You don't fool with the law in this town. Nothing for me today, Sheriff? No, Undertaker, it's all quiet. No one's fooling with the law. If no one fooled with you any more, it would be happier for you. Doctor, how is our business going? Do not talk to me in public, Bones! Grub's up, Tim! Coming, Daddy! Let me follow the undertaker. He's sure to leave town. And then you can ambush him. Okay, cowboy. Make sure you don't touch him. He's ours! What'll it be? As usual, something cold and stiff. Can we talk? - Need my services? - No but... Ah, you're new in town. If I take your measurements, it'll save time later. I take reservations. Mr Bones... I'm here to prevent you becoming your own customer. So, cowboy? This afternoon, he's leaving in his hearse. What for? Business is bad. He's trying door-to-door. He'll go by a deserted road south of here. Wait in ambush at the red rocks. OK, cowboy. Go to Palomino City, our next rendez-vous. It's between the red rocks. You know what you have to do. I'll give you make-up. Gosh! Someone stole the white horse! It won't be long now. I'll stay on this side with William. Jack and Averell, on the other side, behind the rocks. As soon as he passes in front of us... We got him, boys! It's so good to have fun as a family! Must do this more often! If only Mum and Dad had been here! Remember when we were kids, the bank job we did with them?! Yeah! On the way home, we all sang together. What's going on here, cowboy? The annual rodeo... It's a festive occasion. We haven't come to be festive. We've got rid of all the jury. We have to eliminate Judge Groovy. He pronounced the sentence against our uncle. And then we collect the inheritance! It won't be easy. Look! Judge Groovy runs the rodeo. We can't get near him. So, what'll we do? The judge will invite home all the competitors. That's when we can get to him. But to be able to be invited, you have to be in the rodeo. Good idea! Excellent! Next event... calf roping! This is a stupid exercise! Now I've lost my prison thieves! Oh, I think that's them over there. The instinct of the most noble animal is a beautiful thing to behold. What's this thing? Not smart enough to be a calf! It's ours. Keep your rubbish to yourself!! The main thing is not to win, but to participate. Rantanplan gave the example. And now, the breaking of wild horses! Cowboy! Do we really have to participate in this? If you want to get near the judge. No need for us all to go. William, you said that I did everything, right? Oh no, no! I don't have a strong back. But, Jack... I'm very delicate. When we were robbing banks, Mummy would say... "Put your woolly pullover on!" Yeah, I remember. "Put your woolly pullover on!" Why are you looking at me like that? Averell, we have a nice surprise for you! Yeah, it's you who'll finish off the judge! Isn't that a nice surprise? Oh yeah! It's Averell who'll do the job. Luke, get ready to testify that Averell shot him down. - Off you go, Averell! - Where to? We have two last-minute competitors... ...Averell Smith... ...and Lucky Luke! First up... Averell Smith. I've thought about it... I don't want to go! Go on, you've got him! Your left, use your left! Move your legs! And now... ...Lucky Luke! He is mine, this cowboy. I trained him. Lucky Luke, you are the champion! We're sorry, but it's time to finish! I remind the competitors that I'll be waiting for them at my ranch! Is Averell ready? He's gone all weird. He doesn't recognize anyone, not even himself. The horse doesn't seem to have spoiled him otherwise. Hey Averell, are you okay? OK, Averell? Who are you gentlemen? You sure are a funny-looking lot! Yeah. Could he pop off a judge? He seems much the same as usual to me. We've no choice. I'll go with him... wait for us here! You don't remember anything? You're funny-looking, too! Stay there... There's something I have to do. Afterwards, we'll go for a drink. I would like to buy a copy. There... fresh off the press. No, I want a special edition. But there's none today. I'll dictate it to you. I hope he'll be successful. This is the last obstacle to our inheritance. Afterwards, I'll rub out Lucky Luke! He succeeded. He was wonderful! Read the "Palamino Gazette", special edition! All about the brutal murder of Judge Groovy! - It's true? - He succeeded. Listen... "The judge was shot down during his reception after the rodeo. "His murderer, a certain Averell Smith... "...was able to disappear." Bravo Averell! - Fantastic! - Our hero! Let's go to Nothing Gulch! Our inheritance awaits us at Augustus Betting's! Welcome, gentlemen. All went to plan? Yeah, Lucky Luke can attest to that. Everything went as planned. We no longer need you, so I'm going to... Just one moment! There's still a formality... Hey! Let's shorten the formalities... ...but keep within the rules. If you'll come through here, please. We were expecting you. The jury has deliberated. You are accused of nine cases of attempted murder. Lucky Luke is the witness. Gentlemen of the jury, your verdict! Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Ugg! Guilty! Guilty! The Court condemns you to return to prison... ...for the rest of your lives. Lucky Luke! You filthy coyote! It's you who plotted everything! Are you going to stop? You stupid horse! Legally and morally, these terrible guys... ...could not get their hands on the villainous loot... ...already paid out from the notary's care... ...into the safekeeping of a great orphanage. Uncle Henry, you were never an angel... ...but on this day, may heaven forgive you. The darling children sing in choirs of praise... It's the ballad, the ballad of the Daltons. We are dancing with delight... ...thanks to Uncle Henry... ...our dear, dear benefactor. And let's say thank you to him. Everything is fine. I found the prison. I captured the prison thieves. Well, except for the cowboy and his horse. But I will finish up by catching up with him someday. And so ends the ballad of the Daltons. That quartet is resting in prison today... ...dreaming of hits, robberies and ambushes... ...while awaiting their next chance to escape. All of you, big and small, who have a liking... ...for thieves, rascals and crooks... If you want to succeed in crime... You gotta be quick with your six-shooter... Very, very fast with your six-shooter. Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
