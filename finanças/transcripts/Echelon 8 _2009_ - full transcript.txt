How was your day, love? Same as always. Better now. What is the occasion? David, sit down. I have something I want to talk to you about. It's just that we've been together now for four years and it's been great. I feel if I wait around for you we'll both be old and gray, so I figure the hell with tradition. I am asking you David, will you marry me? I wasn't expecting this. Well, I was under the impression you like a little spontaneity from time to time. No, it's not that, it's just... Well, it is. I really wasn't expecting this. You seem troubled. Is everything all right? We need to talk. There's some things you need to know about me. I... I don't understand. You deserve to know the truth. Best thing I can do is just come right out with it. I'm listening. I don't work for Microsoft. I'm an operative with the CIA. This is not funny, David. If this is your idea of a joke, it's really not... I was sent here five years ago to spy on your satellite company under the joint efforts of Interpol and gain Intel from the US government. Ashley, I was sent here to spy on you. So this was all a lie. I was nothing more than an assignment for you. No. I wanted to tell you every day since I found out that you're with Mark. Da... David you're making me nervous. You're not kidding. Why? It was before you told me who you were. It was before we started all this. I do love you. But you've been using me for your work for the past four years. Yes, I have. You son of a bitch. Wait. There's more that I need to tell you. I don't want to hear another lying word out of your mouth. Congratulations David, mission accomplished. I'm sure your government will be very proud of you. Ashley? Ashley? Ash? Ashley? Ash? Ashley? Yeah? Dumont, I've been compromised. I need an extraction. Are you at the house or the embassy? No, neither. I'm at the beach. I can be at the Rendezvous point in about 10 minutes. All right. I'll have an agent meet you there. Just be careful. I'll check in when I'm picked up. It's Dumont. Yeah, I need the London office, please. What the hell happened? Ashley, she knows who I am. How? I told her. Damn it. David, why? Doesn't matter why. Long story short, she split. MI6 sent a sweeper team to take me out. All right. I've arranged for your pick up. Just stay right there. I want to see you here in the office as soon as you get back. Thank you for flying with us. Have a nice day. Good morning, sir. What's your destination? The United States. Are you going on holiday? No. I'm going home. This passports no good sir. Admiral Dumont suggests you use this one. Don't look back, just walk to the plane out the door. I took your request to the full committee. Thank you sir. You and your team are highly regarded on the hill. But we're concerned that operating inside the US could violate the domestic charter. I'll make sure the team knows the boundaries, so you needn't worry about that. On my reassurance that you know how to get the job done, we have agreed to fund and support your echelon team on a trial basis. Actually, I anticipated this, so I have already begun assembling a team. You have full authority to aggressively discover, assess and pursue terrorist activity and to share that intel with the appropriate agency. Understood. We'll share the information. Then we're clear? Absolutely. Agent David Raines to see Admiral Dumont. Security code sir. Delta 91367421. OK sir, you can go right in. Thank you. Admiral? David Raines wants to speak with you. Send him in. Thanks Abigail. Admiral Dumont, forgive me sir but what the hell am I doing here. David, you compromised our operation in London by letting your emotions get the best of you. The company's first reaction was to leave you hanging and burn you. Do you have any idea what it took me to keep that from happening? You owe me. Terrorist activities are on the rise and I do not want second hand intel from other agencies. I want to create a program that monitors all information flowing in, so that we can decide to take direct action when and if it is necessary. So I've put together a team to do just that. You are going to lead that team. That is what the hell you're doing here. I want this team up and running and a report on my desk within a month. You better get to work you have a lot to do. David Rains right? Yeah. Bill Green. Hey. I'm here to help you with your, um, transition. I understand that under your supervision, we're going to be restructured. The new and improved echelon. We'll see. Welcome home Agent Raines. Anthony. How you doing? Good. They got you working here? You know how it is, call of duty. Keeping the country safe and all. Yeah they gave you more money. We get paid for this? Exactly. It's good to see you again. Yeah, you too. Come on. I'll show you to your desk. Tell you what, want to get a beer later? Sure. I got some things I gotta, take care of. Yes by all means take some time to learn the job. Yes. I'm sending you the information right now. What have we got? We intercepted an email from the floor of the Boston, it's a Middle East faction operating here in the US. We know they have the means to follow through on any of the plans they're working. Just not sure of the time table. The time to get involved is now, if we want to have any chance at stopping them. We've got the green light on this project with one restriction, no domestic surveillance. The first lead you bring to me that's what we're doing. But we didn't plan it that way. We just stumbled across it. All right. I'll turn a blind eye to this. Don't let it come back on us. Well, how do we handle the intel we obtained? Pass it on to me, I'll decide what to do with it. Am I clear? Yeah. Can I help you? I'm interested in some flying lessons. Flying lessons? Yes sir. Right that way. Thank you sir. Well, the intel you two picked up is part of a terror plot. They've got a meeting set up for later this morning. You're going to go, to meet the subject they call Maz. You'll pose as the buyer. What happened to the real buyer? We picked him up yesterday. His name is Alan Walker, he specializes in procuring fake IDs and pilot's licenses. He set this meeting up but he says he doesn't know who it's for. Now once you've acquired the package, you'll detain the subject, bring him back here for interrogation. Maybe we can get them working against each other and. Right now he's the only one who might be able to ID the members of this four cells which is what they call themselves I'm on it. Here you go. And David, we need him alive and talking. Yes sir. Yeah. It was a setup. They took the buyer out. They tried to take me out. All's I got is a plate. Give it to me. 3132 November Sierra. Is that a Massachusetts plate? Affirmative. That's registered to the Carson Insurance Agency. That's a cover. A cover for who? For us. What happened to the package? Yes. I understand. I'm on my way. Morning Stephanie. - Good morning. Is he in? Yeah, sure have a seat, I'll call him for you. Thanks. - Thanks. We'll get it straightened out. All right? Yeah. Morning Stephanie. Morning. Hey, nice bit of driving this morning. That's the son of a bitch from the roof. That's the guy that took a shot at me. Consider yourself lucky, I don't usually miss. Enough. Enough. Control yourself. We're on the same team. We have to work together now. Hello Brian. Rick. Is he one of yours? Yes. Agent Marks, Admiral Dumont and... David Rains head of Eschelon Three. Rick, perhaps we should all get on the same page so we don't wind up killing each other out in the field. Of course Admiral, we don't want anybody to get hurt out there, especially since we're going to be working together on this. Well I think we've got it handled. Well, from where I'm standing it doesn't look that way. The package was ours, I gave it to you out of professional courtesy. You gave it to me because you didn't know what to do with it. You boys are finished? Inside. From this point on, your two teams will be working together. Working together include killing me? Clearly I didn't kill you. All right, knock it off. I don't care how it happens, but it will happen all right? Marks, fill him in on what you discovered. I investigated a flight school in California, where a group paid for flying lessons. The hard part was, they only want to learn how to fly commercial airlines while in mid-flight, no takeoffs and no landings. Best we could ascertain is that they were going to hijack a plane that was still airborne. And you didn't feel the need to share this intel with anyone? I shared the intel with my handler. After you examined the contents yourself. Would you mind profiling those subjects for us? Middle Eastern types. The ID's they used were all dead ends, were also great on fakes. I ran their photographs against the FBI database and a few of them came back linked to known terrorist organizations. Afghani types with connections to Bin Laden. Now I know how we came across our information. How did you gather your intel? You don't want to know. I already do. I think it's time we get back and start sorting through all this. Absolutely. I want real time updates. Dismissed. We discovered that not all of the IDs were fake. Mohamed Mas Alzier, the one killed by Marks in the cemetery. He was in possession of a valid state issued ID. But his picture matches an Interpol bolo for a Yezi De. Abasi wanted for a bombing in France where 12 people were killed in 2000. There's not an agency in the country that we can get this information to, and trust it be act upon without questioning our resources. So you're saying we should handle this ourselves? Well I can get Rains and Traverse a couple of FBI IDs and they can go find out who issued the license. I don't want to hear anymore. Rains, Traverse see if you can find something concrete on this. Take me to 47A Roxbury. You got it. Sure we have the right address? This is what our boss gave us. What can you tell me about this license? Never seen it before. You issued it. Well, I issue a lot of licenses. Yes but this particular license is a Yezi De Abasi who is currently being investigated for terrorist activity. Terrorist activity? You must have the wrong person. Well I'm sure you don't want to be an accessory to the fact, who is he? He is a friend of my husband's. He's a Jordan national. He said he just needed the ID for a job. He's a good guy. Well, this good guy doesn't look like a Jordan national. He converted. I'm sure he did. Where's your husband? He's not here, he's away on business. How convenient. He's in insurance sales, he doesn't know anything about this. Look, why don't you just question Mr. Abasi? We would, but you see, he's dead. What? He was shot and killed yesterday by one of our agents. Trying to sell some of your fake licenses. How long you been married for? Just a couple months. Why? If you are implying that my husband is using me because of my job. Look, my husband loves me. You expecting a call? Is it your husband? Hold on for one sec. Green? Yeah, I got a call for you, I need you to trace it. - Come on, easy guy. Come on. What's with the dramatics? We're just trying to have a chat here, but it's a one way conversation and I'm getting a little bored, OK? Why don't you fill me in on the cultural gap here, because of I been reading about the 77 virgins that you're going to get when you go straight to see Allah in heaven and all of this. Let me just tell you a little story about hell. You know what the hell is? It's having to contend with 77 virgins, that's hell buddy. Let's talk numbers. Cause you have two choices. One, you talk to me. Two, you keep your mouth shut the way your doing, the problem is two comes a little caveat. Got that? Understand that? OK. So, I'm preferable to one. Come on. Because I got all night here, I dropped the $27.95 to stay in this hotel pit with you, OK? I got a no problem bunking up. The cellphone signal we traced puts it in Boston. I'm still working on an exact location. One of Stacey Meyer's credit cards was used to purchase a flight to Boston this morning. Flight landed just a little while ago. OK, you two, you're going to Boston. Get Abdul and bring him back here. I need to know everything that he knows. Call as soon as you land, by then we'll have an exact address for you. What the hell are you doing here? Just visiting a friend. Who's this? This? This is the guy that took a shot of me in the cemetery. Buy you don't have to worry. He's one of us. You working the same case? That depends. Who you here to see? Guy named Abdul. You know him? Yeah, I know him. I just talked to him He's a dead end. He knows nothing. Doesn't matter. We need to talk to him ourselves. Where is he now? Look, I'd love to stay in chat but I got a flight to catch. Pleasure meeting ya. Make the call. Yeah. Good. All right, I've got an address for you. It's in South... South Boston. How'd you know that? Think Mark's got too him already. What's he doing there? He's gone now. All right, send Rains to the hotel. You stick around the airport, keep an eye on Marks. Gotta go Rains. I'm sending you a file with intel. Yeah, I just got it. Yeah. Dumont, Abdul is dead. How? He was tortured. Do you think it was Marks? I'll get back to you. You're sure this is accurate? Positive. I don't know how you and Agent Dun worked together, but I don't condone torture Agent Marks. It worked. You stay in Boston. We're coming to you. All right gentlemen, I need you on your A games this morning. We have reason to believe that terrorists are about to plant explosive devices on civilian aircraft. We don't know what these devices are, we don't know which aircraft, we don't know which airline. We're not going to follow the devices. We're going to focus our attention on the individuals. Marks... - OK. We're going to enter the terminal under the guise of a security exercise. Once inside, we split into teams of two and maintain only radio contact. You've all been briefed on the individuals we are looking for. Anyone seen fitting the description will be detained and interrogated. Raines and Traverse will be the first contacted upon any detention. Is that clear? Questions? Let's go. Trooper, we need to see your head of security, please. That would be the FBI. They came in last night and they're running the show now. FBI section Chief Warren. What can I do for you? CIA Agent Dumont. We have information on events that are about to occur here, and we'd like you to shut down the terminal and stop all flights and let us take a look around. That's not going to happen. You tell me what's going on, and I'll decide on how to act on it. I'm sorry that's classified information. But it is a matter of National Security. So I expect your cooperation. Let me tell you something, this is the jurisdiction of the FBI. I'm in charge here. So unless you have the President of the United States on speed dial, will you give me something to work on, you're not entering the premises. This is crap. We wasting valuable... Raines. You don't understand the gravity of the situation. That's because you haven't told me anything. Escort these man to the door. Is that the way you are going to play it? That's exactly the way it's going to be played. Gentleman. All right stand down. We have breaking news out of lower Manhattan. A plane has allegedly crashed into the World Trade Center. Again a plane has... Breaking news at this time, tower two has just been struck by a second airplane. New York City... The Pentagon has just been struck. Officials are now willing to say they strongly suspect terrorism. We now have reports that the passengers of Flight 93, in a heroic attempt to thwart the plan... We can now officially report that both of the Twin Towers has collapsed. Yes I understand. You know you're not the only one dealing with this right now. Actually I'm taking care of it as we speak, I'll call you right back. What t hell is going on down there? The entire government is looking to us for answers and all I'm getting from you are more questions. We could have stopped this whole thing this morning. Well why didn't we? Because the FBI locked us out and I couldn't share the intel because of the way it was gathered. Well how was it gathered and by whom? The Echelon Group. Echelon Group? I know that. I need specific agents names and I need meetings with them now, to be held accountable. Not my team, Your team? All right, fine. You and your team are taking a fall on this. David Raines. Anthony Traverse. They developed the intel on this, they got the ball rolling, intercepted some domestic email and put the pieces together. Domestic e-mails? They've been intercepting US communications. Cage Mark's got a young man named Abdul to talk. You me torture. I didn't say that. No I did. Your team has violated every protocol that has been issued to it. My hands are tied here. You are making the entire department look incompetent. Just get them up here. Now. That'll be all. Agent Rains, as team leader of the Eschelon Group, where did you come to the conclusions of your findings? And if you have any other information that might be valid to this investigation, now would be the time to give it. Well I know that you're not going to like where this investigation is headed too. Where is that? A little too close to home. Obviously the direction of your investigation is off base. You've spied on your own country and worst of all, you were caught doing it. It seems that ever since you were compromised in London, you're not as sharp as you used to be. I'm taking you off this case. You're hereby reassigned. Reassigned? Reassigned where? See your Handler for a new assignment. You can't do this to me. I assure you, I just did. Send in Cage. So you tortured Abdul to get the Intel on Logan, and let me add, the only reason he found him was by violating the FISA Act. So that even if we could have stopped the attack we wouldn't be able to prosecute because the evidence would have been thrown out of court for as inadmissible. At least we would have stopped it. Come on, you can give me better than that. You forget it. I won't compromise my team. Fine. Then your hereby reassigned to the farm as an instructor. Swat entry in urban warfare. No more field work. Send in Traverse. Looks to me like you followed in the footsteps of Agent Rains. You can follow him right out of this unit, unless you give me something real to act on. Yes sir. From what I gather, you're looking for a few low level operatives to hang out to dry. So you can save your own ass. And the ass of the President, who by the way, courteously rushed the Bin Laden family out of the country for their own safety. And to protect this company from any embarrassment for training that nutcase Osama in the deserts of Afghanistan. That makes the President just as responsible for this tragedy as the men who flew those planes into those buildings. Thank you for your assessment Agent. You're not being reassigned, you're being terminated. Don't get cute thinking you're onto something. I'll get you any time, anywhere. Now, get out. Yes, sir. Good evening, sir. It's Russell. How you holding up? They fired me today. What? Re-assigned. Basically fired. What happened? CIA didn't want to take the fall, figured they pin the blame on a team that could have prevented this whole damned thing. And Dumont? Dumont is the bastard that threw me under the bus. He screwed me in London, now he's screwing me here back home. So what are going to do now? Personnel. Re-assigned, answering phones. 24 hours ago I was on a team that could have prevented this country's worst terrorist attacks, and now I'm going to be answering phones. Could be worse. You could be dead CIA doesn't like loose ends. Or loose cannons for that matter. How'd you get out? Who says I'm out? My status might say retired, but believe me you'll never get out. Take my advice David, take what they give you. Don't let them think you're weak. It's not how I trained you to be. Think of it as a test. Dammit Russell. Does everything have to be a test? Thousands of innocent people lost their lives today. Was that a test? Yes. It was. One that we failed. I don't know what they have planned for you, but I do know Dumont could have sold you out a long time ago and he didn't. Han in there. See how this plays out. You know I'm going to be there to help you, however I can. Now go home. Get some rest. Still training me on how to handle. Things. It's my job. You can stay here if you... No. I should go home. Thank you, sir. This is crap. Dumont sold us out to Chase and he did it with a smile. You don't know that. Here's what I know. We took the blame for somebody else's mistake. Well, Re-assigned. I'm gonna be doing background checks on new recruits. I'm telling you we were onto something. Reassigned is better than fired. Make no mistake about it, I got a big bull's eye on my back. I'm out there floating in the wind. I'm just waiting for them to come and find me. I got no choice but to get out of town. If you go under, you better go way under. There was no cover up and you were wrong. They're still going to come after you. Even worse if there was a cover up. They're going to come after you. The question isn't is there a cover up the question is how deep does the cover up go? Well there ain't nothing you and I can do about that now. You better fly under the radar. Look, I gotta run. I'll talk to you soon. If you need anything. You call me. Or if you suspect anything out of the ordinary. You call me. I will. So did they go for it? Leave the keepers to me. If the President can sell him on Homeland Security, I can sell them on this. Director Chase, Admiral Dumont, these closed sessions are not to be discussed with anyone. We are the only commission that will have knowledge of these proceedings. Know this, this must be a unanimous decision and that depends on what you say here today. Gentlemen the floor is yours. I don't like this one bit. The idea of giving you this level of power and control, frankly scares me. I understand your concerns gentlemen. But for years, the CIA has stood by and watched as the FBI and the Homeland Security have failed in their attempt to thwart terrorism here in the United States. Now our plan to take charge in this matter is laid out in the package in front of you. We are well aware of this package director. We've had time to discuss it. This request is most unprecedented. What you're asking goes against everything the CIA stands for. Domestic Charter? You're asking us to step on a lot of toes. If approved, the ramifications could be catastrophic to an entire justice system. Not to mention the impact this will have on the entire intelligence community and the flow of shared information. We've never asked for anything like this before because there's never been a need for it. Extreme times call for extreme measures. If you think that using the aftermath of 9/11 as a stage to get a foothold on domestic surveillance, then my response is "no". These actions would wreak havoc on society. I'm not sure the citizens of the United States are ready for the methods the CIA uses. Not on our own soil. We have a team to meet the challenge. One team. One city. Our existence known to only a select few. We'd work quietly with little need of support and our success would save countless lives. And what if you fail? The last thing we need to see on CNN is the method you use exposed to the world. Or some underpaid lawyer from the ACLU ripping us a new one. Or the media exposing the identity of your team. Even worse, one of us. Where were you thinking of launching this program? Hey look, my long lost buddy. Bartender, A drink from my friend here. Hold on he doesn't drink. He's strictly by the book. Is this where you're living now? You don't have to worry about that. My years of government training have prepared me for this. I am an expert. Can we Talk. Talk? Sure. What should we talk about? How you gave up my team? Or better yet how you didn't show up for Traverse funeral. Dave, you got a problem with this guy? You got a problem with me, Dave? Dave doesn't have a problem with me. Look, I need your help. We have a chance to make things right. Are you kidding me? That time has come and gone. When you sober up, give me a call. Bartender, whatever he wants. Rick we have to talk. I agree. We go way back and I don't want anything to mess that up. I'm OK with that. Good. I need your man Marks. Marks is my best man. I know he's your best man, that's why I need him. You're going to need him. He's yours. Thanks. It was trial by fire for you and Eschelon 8. This is your first priority. That's Ian Graves. He's an international arms dealer. Matter of fact, a few years ago the FBI intercepted a 767 filled with his arms heading for Sierra Leone. Now we know it was Graves, but the FBI couldn't pin it on him. With this new President, war is no longer a priority. So, Mr. Graves is searching for a new source of income. He could start another war. I don't want to repeat the last time. How do I know that's not going to happen. I'm in control now. Yeah. David Rains. Was wondering when you're going to crawl out from under that rock and come see me. Yeah, I'm here now. Come on by. Good. Excuse me Admiral section Chief Warren is here to see you. Um, he said it's urgent. Send him in. Ryan I heard you were in town. New assignment? Training exercises, you know how that goes. What, no invite to the new office? I'm insulted. What can I do for you Mark? Well, I was looking for a little bit more honesty from you. It looks a little too well-planned out to just to be a training exercise. Again what can I do for you? You're not wanted here. This is my town and spooks have a talent of getting in the way and screwing things up. Besides you don't like sharing intel with the rest of the kids in the family. So I'm going to ask you again, what are you doing here? Just a training exercise, but thanks for stopping by. It's not that easy. I got Agents in place and the FBI has logged a lot of man hours to get things done. Well why don't you pass over those operational files and we'll go through them and see if we've stumbled on anything. This is not a joke. I need your cooperation on this. Where was your cooperation? Why bring up the past? We all made mistakes that day. My team paid for those mistakes. Actually it was America that paid. Sorry I can't help you. But thanks for stopping by. So I got the call from Dumont. Doesn't surprise me. He's into something big. What do you mean? Word is he's connected. He's got this new command from some very powerful people. There's this big hush about what he's running. Who's pulling the strings? They're called The Keepers. No one knows who they are. Have you had any dealings with them yet? No nothing yet. I was hoping you would give me something more to go on. I wish I could. Do yourself a favor, crawl back under that rock you were under and forget he ever called. The Keepers squashed any investigation into Traverse. And if they see you as a threat, you're going to wind up the same way. So you believe they're responsible for Traverse death? I'm saying be cautious about the battles you pick. The Keepers of the secrets are a very old society. And no one knows who they are and they're everywhere. Well if they caused 9/11 they should be brought to justice. How do you stop a shadow? What you know about Ian Graves? Powerful also well connected. Big entrepreneur. Why are you looking at him? His name showed up on a few cross matches for terrorist cells, weapons trading financing, information sharing, that kind of stuff. It's a big fish your tyring to catch there. Graves is practically untouchable. He has made himself a constant in government policies. His business dealings really fuel the economy, more than most. War manufacturing, defense contracts, television, record companies, you name it. If it makes money Graves is involved somehow. Is he one to break the law? Nobody gets that powerful by being squeaky clean, if you know what I mean. But, with big power comes big payoffs and graves has a lot of people on the payroll. And if he's taken out of the mix, a lot of people are going to lose money. When people lose money, people get pissed. I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for the insight. I gotta run. You need anything else, you know how to find me. Cautious who you talk to David. And remember this, what's said in the light, can be heard in the dark. Things haven't been light for a very long time my friend. Good morning. First of all, thank you for accepting your assignments here at E-8. Agent Dunn, Marks, Green, Rains you know each other. This is Agent Savannah Rock with surveillance. Jackie Peckham our Profiler. This is a new unit with new rules and operating procedures, which you're probably not familiar with. But people, let's be assured you are now the first line of defense in the war on terror. So what exactly are we working on? Agent Rains will explain. We have several satellites in orbit multitasking, working together. The objective is simple. Information. This program will be called Echelon 8. So how's this any different than Eschelon 4? Well, its different because we'll be monitoring over a million cell phone calls and hour. We will also be monitoring about 90% of email traffic and flag all priority calls for review and action. Now here comes the tricky part. We'll be monitoring law enforcement on local, state and federal levels. So we'll be monitoring the US? Yes we've been chartered for domestic surveillance. Now I know this is your first day, but there is a sense of urgency. Agent Green, will you please describe what you discovered this morning. Well, we intercepted a message. It makes reference to a shipment through customs. They posses some sort of a computer controlled weapon. Somehow associated with something called black ice. The message is strongly encrypted. Originated from a Unix based computer and I think I have a knock on the IP address. If you get the IP address, we can find out who manufactured the chip and where it was sold. I can get us the physical address. Yes you can. Please do. Sir, ready for you. Welcome. I want to thank you all for joining me on this fine day. I want to take this moment to make it abundantly clear why we will succeed. Slavery has never ended in this country. It has simply been transferred from blacks picking cotton in the fields, to our devoted middle class their unchained but modernized, to both make the goods we dictate and buy the goods we dictate. That is the American culture. America buys in and we sell out. Now through this way, our citizens are told what to watch, what to wear, what to buy, who to vote for, what to vote for. Americans have always been slaves to this system. The keepers of this country would not allow the future of America to lie in the hands of this ridiculous melting pot. And that my friends, is the greatest manipulation ever known. Or I should say, never known. Remember the surge of patriotism in America following 9/11? The economy thrived. We all thrived. But now they've forgotten. It's now time that they be reminded. Recession is affecting us all in some way and I'm turning this country around before it gets worse. No matter what the cost. David's got priorities for the groups, I want to shift some resources over. Dumont, the chip. We have an address where it was sold. We traced to a computer shop in Philadelphia. All right, you two go pick up that hacker. He's the only lead we have right now. Hi. Agent Peckham. This is Agent Green. We understand a certain computer chip was sold here about three weeks ago. It's a 3.8 gigahertz quad core processor. Four of them. We need to know who you sold them too. Robert Westcott. You remembered that pretty fast. The kid comes in here all the time. I think he comes down from Jersey. Why? I can get the good stuff. I ordered the chip for him a few weeks ago. I'm one of the only distributors in the area that could get it for him. I asked him what he needed it for, he just said work. Must be some kind of work. We'll need an address. Sure. Um, can you look up a Robert Wescott for me? W-E-S Says here 56 Raritan Avenue in Cliffwood. Thank you. Peckham and Green got us an address on the chip. Subject's name is Robert Westcott. 23 years old, super hacker. He's on the FBI's watch list. Now he sent that black ice message. So let's bring him in. Yo, Ice. Head him off. What you doing? What do you guys want? I-I-I-don't know anything. We all know that's not entirely true. Is it Rob? I told you guys, I don't have any interest in what you're doing. I-I-I-did my job. I got my money. I'm done with this. We all know it don't work that way. Please just just- Now that we all on the same page. What did you do with the file? What file? What you think this a game? The plans Mr. Westcott. We know you saw the plans. Yes, OK but-I saw some sort of message, but I have no idea what it meant. I swear, look I'm telling you the truth. I don't know anything. Well, it's all good now, it's clear. I believe you Mr. Westcott. We don't have no more use for him. No. No. Federal Agents. Drop your weapons. Dead. He's dead too. You Robert Westcott? These guys friends of yours? Am I under arrest? No Robert, we're just going to have to ask you a few questions. But let's get you cleaned up first. Easy, easy, easy, easy. Well Robert, it looks like you managed to get yourself into a little bit of trouble. Let's skip the "Thank you" for saving your life and get right to it. Who wants to see you dead? Your guess is as good as mine. Well, I'm guessing Ian Graves. I'm also guessing that he hired you to perform some hacking jobs for him. Another guess is that he doesn't want you talking. So unless you give us something, we can help you. Can you explain to me how $75,000 in cash deposits ended up in your bank account over the past three months? My grandmother gave it to me. Don't be a wise ass. Look, just a few harmless hacking jobs that was it. No that's not it. We found the hidden files on your computer. We were able to decode a few words, two of which being black ice. What does it mean? You have no idea what you're getting involved with. Enlighten me. If I do, I die. Plain and simple. We can protect you. Look, my silence is the only thing that's keeping me alive right now, so you know what thanks but no thanks. Save the formalities Brian. We're here for Westcott. Westcott who? Why don't you cut the crap. Your people scooped him up. Our subject told us who he is, that means he belongs to us. I got a judge releasing him to our custody. Bring me to him now or I'll expose your whole damn training exercise. Is that a threat Mark? Yeah, I warned you not to cross me. You don't get it. You just don't get it. You don't see how close we are to another tragedy, do you? Who the hell do you think you are sitting there on your little high horse? You're a loose cannon. But you're not above the law. Wescott. Now. Tell you what. Why don't we take a look at some of Ian Graves former employees? This is gonna be fun. Are you ready Robert? How about if we take a look at that guy, what do you think? No? Doesn't do it? What about that guy? No? Still not there yet? How about that guy? I'd say he lost a few inches? What do you think? Come on. What does black ice refer to? Come on. It's their plan or their operation or something... Operation for what? I don't know. I know all this stuff. They don't confide in me. I mean I overheard someone once talk about, like, chemicals or something but... that'll be all. Mr. Westcott's coming with me. What are you talking about, we're not done here yet. Yes we are. I have a court order for his release. You have no grounds to hold him... Dumont? Sorry guys, the man has a warrant. You gotta be kidding me. Robert Robert, get your punk ass back here. Robert, don't do this you have to tell me what black ice means. Don't say anything Robert. Don't listen to these guys. You will be dead in 24 hours. He cannot protect you. Tell us what black ice means. Tell us! You'll be dead in 24 hours. Get down! He's dead. You compromised my people. You compromised this whole operation with your stupid move. Get your hands off of me. I compromised your little training exercise? You just cost us our only lead in this case. You cost us our only lead in this case. I'll have your ass for this. Charles, have a seat. Share a toast with us. Ladies. Isn't this a little early to celebrate? The die is cast. The Rubicon crossed. And victory is ours. To victory! Lady Grace. Did you know Wescott was picked up by the feds? Excuse me? I was waiting to hear confirmation from my men. They were headed to his house earlier. I-I-I-know we, we, we sent them, let me call... Don't bother. He's dead. Dead? You're goons took him out. Outside the Federal Building. That was very bold of them. I thought they were taking care of this at Westcott's? Quietly. Even the most thought out plans tend to change every now and then. The outcome is all that matters. Did he give anything to the feds? My sources say no. We got a lead on Westcott's boss. Seems like he's pretty high up on the totem pole over at Grave's organization. His name is Charles Dunning. Dunning International? Software firm? Westcott was his lead programmer. Now when they found out we were about to pick that kid up. That's when they tried to kill me. I must say I'm impressed with the kid. Perhaps I should of kept him around. To Westcott! May he rest in peace. I know we've got to look inside somewhere and we've got to find out who that is, but for now I want Charles Dunning. You want to bring him back here? No not here. We have to be a little bit more discreet, so when the team gets him, call me. I'll tell you where to take him. We don't have much time. Excuse me, sir? Hi. Hey sweetie, how are you? Can you help me, I have a flat tire? How's it go with Dunning? Smooth as silk. What is this place? For now this is Dunning's personal interrogation center. David, before we go inside, there's something you ought to know. There are a couple of people here who... Agent Raines? Anthony? What the hell is this? You're dead. Well, it seems somebody pretty high up wanted me out of the picture permanently. They hired someone to take me out. They should have hired somebody better. Instead of looking over my shoulder for the rest of my life. I went to Admiral Dumont. He was the only one I could trust without putting anyone else in harm's way. You could have trusted me. I didn't want to get you involved. That should have been my decision to make. Well, it was my decision. I went to Dumont and he sent me to London. Why London? I signed him to MI6. MI6. The same team that tried to take me out. Nice. I went to your funeral. I buried you. Do you have any idea what that was like for me? I can only imagine. No, you can't. You wanted me to think you're dead. Now you're dead. To me. Raines... I don't want to hear it. You knew the whole damn time and you didn't tell me. How am I supposed to work with people that I can't even trust? Who do you trust David? Ashley. What the hell is going on? I think you know agent Ashley Giles. Agent? MI6? This woman cannot be trusted. You're one to talk about trust. Look I'm sorry, David. It was horrible but MI6 was not responsible for the attempt on your life. We were already compromised by the same group who was responsible for the London bombings. One of us must have stumbled upon their cell without knowing it. And when you told me who you were, I had to report it back to MI6 and they ordered me out. The terrorists then came for you. So MI6 hung me out to dry. Is that accurate? MI6 was just protecting their own... Anthony, shut up. What are you trying to do defend them now? Who do you think you're telling to shut up? I'm not your second anymore. I don't need you protecting me. David we would have done the same thing and you know it. I'm sorry it had to be like this. But things are different now. Different? How? Well, now we're working with a division of MI6, so get used to it. That being said, I want to know what Mr. Dunning knows. We just need a location. Names. Who's involved? I don't know anything. We all know why you're here. What I know is, this is illegal. I want my lawyer. Hey, Chuck. You're a little gross there Chuck. You nervous? You know what? You look like the type that gets nervous around pretty girls. Or is it boys? Maybe it is. I'm sorry to interrupt you in the middle of a conversation. What is your relationship to Ian Graves? I've worked with Mr. Graves on occasion in the past. Have you worked with him recently? On a project called Black Ice? I never heard of it. Mr. Dunning, no one knows you're here. So no one can help you. You can't do this. Who the hell do you think you are? Let me out of here. We don't want you Charles. We want Graves. Give him up to us we'll cut you a deal. You can't touch Graves. He's above all of you. He's not above the law. The law. Look at you, talking about the law. You abduct me, home me illegally without counsel. Who are you to preach to me about the law? I am a citizen of your precious United States. No Chuck, you're a prisoner in a warehouse. Somewhere in South Jersey and your situation really sucks. OK. And you're making it worse because you're being a little hard on Ms. Peckham here. If you'll excuse us for a second Ms. Peckham. I'd love to just have a moment with Chuck. I'm gonna make it real simple. I'm a numbers guy. OK? Makes things very uncomplicated. I'm gonna ask you three questions Chuck. One, where's Graves operating from? If you think I'm going to tell you anything, you're not as smart as I thought you were. You know what? I'm not the smartest guy in the room. But I am the biggest. Get this maniac off me. I'm gonna gut your eyeball! OK, stop it! Stop it! OK! Mr. Dunning, Anthony Traverse, are you all right sir? What the hell? Who are you? Anthony Traverse, I'm working undercover. Undercover? For who? Ian Graves. Graves? You don't think Mr. Graves does what he does without a little help from the inside, do you? How do you know Mr. Graves? Remember the border patrol deal in Los Angeles that almost went sour? Yes. I was the one who ordered the stand down on the East Wing in the building. Allowing the shipment and Mr. Grave's to get out unnoticed. That was you? Very clever. How did Graves know where to find me? Mr. Graves doesn't know about this. I've been monitoring all agent activity pertaining to Mr. Graves. When I heard you got picked up, I had to act quickly. By the way, if I were you I'd keep this to myself. Mr. Graves does not react well to those who've been compromised. Thank you Traverse. Mr. Dunning I'd love to stay and reminisce, but we have to get you out of here. You're on a timetable. Jason, it. Charles. I had to handle a few things. Overacting. Like you could have done any better. Did he buy it? We'll see. Did he bite? Yes. The tracking device is operational. He's on I-80 traveling westward. Road and Traverse are 10 minutes behind. How's the audio? Audio is clear. And he has a call coming in. Track it. Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch with you for hours. I had to handle a few things. Are the laptops ready to ship? Is the toxin activated? Yeah. The visas are ready. Are you on your way? I'll be there in an hour. So is black ice the toxin? Is there a black toxin? Come on Dunning, where are you going? Dunning owns a computer company that supplies schools across the country. There's an open order for 10,000 laptops. That could mean 10,000 children. Or more if the toxin becomes airborne. Where would they house the toxin? In that fuses. Dunning's company manufactures fuses. How can they release it? Well, they can send an energy surge right through the motherboard and cause the whole fuse to blow. How would they do that? - Right through the web. It's brilliant. Now all of a sudden you're a big fan. The toxins inside the fuses. Inside the laptops. Graves sends an energy surge through the internet and the fuse blows, releasing the toxins. So with one click of a mouse. My God. I've got a location. North Jersey. It's an old zinc mine. Just off Route 10. Let's move out. The stops now. All right Cage. You know what to do. Giles, Traverse, secure the ridge. Eliminate any threats. Copy that. Freeze. Perimeter secure. Proceed to foxtrot. All right, snipers around the ridge to protect your entrance. You know your jobs once you're inside. Be careful. Lock and load. We Don't know what this toxin is. Or what it can do. So, please exercise extreme caution in there. We have intel that confirms that Graves is personally overseeing the operation. Remember, if any of you should come in contact with him, he is more valuable alive. Agent Marks, we are changing your team's objective to Charlie hotel. Repeat, C-harlie H-otel. Your new object. This is where they are warehousing infected computers. Agent Rains, continue to the original objective. Repeat, the original object. Are the fuses going to remain stable when the computers are shipped? Barring any accidents, like a car crash, they'll be fine. The case won't open until we send the signal. What happens if there's an accident? Depending on how many fuses get broken, it could kill off a whole city block or two. Yeah, he's with me right now. I gotcha. Graves's is ready for ya. Graves. This place is crawling with feds. Hold them off. Don't stop! How did they find out about our location? I don't know. You must have been followed. I wasn't. I made sure of that. Where were you earlier this evening? I told you I was taking care of a few things. Where were you? I was picked up by some government agency. I didn't say a word to them. Your guy Traverse got me out. Who the hell is Traverse? He said he worked for you. He's the one that got me out. It saddens me how stupid you could be Charles. Ian, I... Clear out. Jason, mask on. Federal Agents, drop your weapon. Clear! Rains, status? We got an Agent down. Graves is in the Northeast shaft of the mill. Copy that. We've got to move out. Dumont has a location on Graves. Move. Move, Peckham, stay with Fiore. Graves! Forgive me, but I think it's a little rude that you know my name and I haven't had the pleasure of an introduction. Were you not taught manners in your youth? Hands behind your head and drop to your knees. Do you have any idea how much this suit cost? This is your last warning. And this is your first. Put your weapons down, walk away before things get complicated for you and that lovely little young lady. Come into the light. To hide such a beauty would, would be the real crime here. Charming Graves, but we've seized the toxin. Your operation is over. Do you honestly think I built myself on a single minded operation? Multitasking is the way of the new millennium agents. The next one goes right through her head. David take him out. Don't worry about me. Do you actually even know who you're working for? I mean, what you're fighting for? Men like you Agent are given orders by people like me. You're sent out into the real world, risking your lives day in and day out. While we sit behind closed doors, making real decisions about the fate of this country. Let her go Graves. A country which people actually think they have a say in what really happens. Imagine that a democracy. I mean one can only fear what would happen if the public really had a say in what went on. I say to you, stand down. Don't do it David. You're insane Graves. Let her go or I promise you, I will take you out. I'm insulted. More than anyone, I'm the Patriot here. Then why are you trying to kill thousands of people? It's a sacrifice. To the gods of power and money. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a flight to catch. Good job. Check out the medic. Thank you. Good job. You OK? Two casualties. Well, we stopped the shipment. The toxins been secured. Agents are going out to make sure the infected computers don't hit the streets. What about Ian Graves? We'll get him next time. You know we did a good job here today. You saved my life back there. Yeah. Don't think it makes up for eight years. Director Chase, Admiral Dumont and I must admit, when we first visited the idea of reviving Eschelon, I honestly felt we were going down the wrong path. However, all the recent events, this country is indebted to you. No one will ever know how close we actually came to another nationwide tragedy. However, we feel it's in our country's best interest to continue with the Eschelon program. We commend you on your successful efforts. And your request for additional funding has been granted. You're aware gentlemen that outside these walls, your team doesn't exist. That will be all gentlemen. Thank you! Well, we got what we wanted. At what price? There's demons in my life. They've all become parasites. It's driving me to drink. Anything to stop from thinking. Cause I'm never OK. Just really good at acting that way. I'm making myself sick, with all the evil thoughts I'm thinking. Gonna run away. Keep this candle burning brightly. It's me in the dark. I need this light so fate with find me. Fate come find me. Fate come, fate come. Their trying to steal my dreams. And these four walls are laughing at me. The suits control the game. But they can't change a thing about me. I'm not gonna run away. Keep this candle burning brightly. It's me in the dark. I need this light so fate will find me. I'm not gonna run away. I'll keep this candle burning brightly. It's me in the dark. I need this light. This is how America pays. With fire revolution for this. Think it's time for change. This is how America pays. With fire evolution for this. Think it's time for a change. This isn't fair what I'm seeing. It's the planet Earth. Not just America bleeding. Things went from bad to worse. Smoke is filling the sky. Got these crooked politicians sending children to die. There'll be no peace tonight, keep the beast in sight. Although he sleeps in the west and the east will fight and natural compensation for the terror and rage. It isn't right. But this is how America pays for every innocent victim the systems ever produced. For the troops overseas left crippled and wounded, losing my patience. United Nations the face and body, hiding the troops, in finding excuses for fighting. Troops in the back, magic is the castle collapses. Stashes their filthy fingers on the ashes and scatter them. The dragons freeze up their heads if they fail. Gotta make them listen and see past this hell. Now this is how America pays. We'll fight a revolution for this. Think it's time for a change. This is how America pays. We'll fight a revolution for this. Think it's time for a change.
