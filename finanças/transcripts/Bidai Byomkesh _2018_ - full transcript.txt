NONAPUKUR POLICE STATION 11:00 PM What? What is that? I've killed someone. I've killed someone with this knife... Murder... What are you talking about? Why? First degree? First degree. Who did you kill? The body is at the Nonapukur dumpyard. Bring it here. Is the person dead? Write down the report. What? Please write the report. Poddar? Poddar? Make a phone call. To whom? DC Krishnendu Malo. What should I say? Tell him my name. DC Abhimanyu Bakshi. Son of Byomkesh Bakshi. FAREWELL BYOMKESH Those eyes have learnt illusion from the night. You see through my heart. Who knew what was hidden in that heart? I couldn't see my heart in your eyes. I sing my lonely song alone. One by one the songs are lost in the eternal darkness. Ajit, she had eyes... And she chose me. Dad! Why haven't you eaten yet? I was waiting for you all. This is not right. I'd already told you I'll be working late. - Have you taken your diabetes medicine? - Yes. - I'm getting dinner ready... - Satyaki? He's not back yet. Dad, again? The doctor has asked you to stop smoking. Why just the doctor? Even the cigarette packets have warning. You're not doing the right thing. If something happens to you... I'll not die so easily. A truth-seeker might leave his last story incomplete. But I am a father. How can I leave? How many times do I have to say sorry? I didn't realise that I bought tickets for the Hindi dubbed version. - I asked Siri... - Siri? Then you should have watched the movie with Siri. "Your information was correct. The weapons..." If you hated it so much, why didn't you just leave? I could have but you thought that the tickets were too expensive. Good night. Hey! Hey! Wait! Where are you going? You must see how this ends. - The neighbours are watching. - Let them. None of them have watched "Fast and Furious" in Hindi. "Flaunt your style. Keep yourselves safe. Racers, are you ready?" "Let the race begin!" Good night! Siri, you messed it up. I'm sorry, sir. I got a little late. You could have eaten. When did you get back, Mom? Would it have been easier if I came back earlier? Wash your hands. Can't believe I still have to tell you. Were you driving? It's a bad habit to shock people like this, Grandad. Your tshirt still has the seatbelt's mark. And what does that prove? People who sit it in the front also have to wear seatbelts. - You probably don't know that. - Really? In that case the belt will be on the left shoulder. The mark on yor tshirt is from right to left. - Elementary, my dear Satyaki... - Grandad... These bluffs were good for the old-school detective novels and cinemas. Doesn't work anymore. You have to be like BBC's "Sherlock" now. One look at Watson and he can say he's a doctor, fought in the Gulf War... has an alcoholic sister, he went to therapy... Everything. - May I try? - What do you want to try? This... Let me see if I get it right. What? You had gone for a movie... English film but you watched a Hindi dubbed version. Then you fought in the car. Tunna has already reported everything to you? Superb! She told me that you're heading home and that you're very angry. Satyaki, you don't have a license. It's not that I don't have it. I've lost it and I'll find it. Don't worry. Moreover, it's Tunna's dad car. No one will say anything. They'll come and apologise if they stop us. Relax. Would you be able to say this if your dad was around? My dad? Where is my dad? He's nowhere around. No one knows where he is. We have a famous detective... Sorry, truth-seeker at home. Even he doesn't know where his own son is. Satyaki, you... you can't talk like this. Why can't I, Mom? I hear it a lot, " Hey, your grandad can't find his son?" And here, people are still making films about Grandad. Icon! Bengal's icon! You're crossing your limit, Satyaki. Then why do you bring up a man who is not around? I didn't know him even when he was here. Do you remember a family vacation, Mom? He's only remembered when I drive without a license. Like a spirit... Like God... Like Police... Satyaki... - Your father... - My father, what? Eevrybody is waiting, Grandad. They'll declare Dad as dead once the 12 year period is over. Instead of lecturing me, why didn't you find Dad's body? We could've mourned him... - Satyaki, shut up or else... - Or else? You'll hit me? Go ahead... Disgusting! Daughter-in-law... You shouldn't have said those things... He's grown up now. And I deserve this. My failure... I deserve it. You're very mad at your dad, aren't you? He didn't have time for you when he was around... Never took you on a vacation... Never helped you with your homework... - Never played cricket with you... - Better. I don't miss him. You're talking about the past. I'm older now. I grew up just fine... No problems... Nobody knows where he is... I didn't miss him... even for a day... He had always kept himself drowned in work... He had no time for me either. He would say, "I'm working towards a safer world for my son." Utopia. He just said all this to justify his workaholic self. What about me working late? Do you feel angry? You've spent your entire life waiting for Dad. You're finally living your life. And that's how it should be. Apologise to your grandfather in the morning. I can't handle all this bad blood between you and your grandson. He's the one showing anger. I didn't say anything to him. That's his irritation. Who else will he take it out on? You've literally brought him up. You are like his pillow. Punching bag. Do you know what your grandson calls me, Satyaboti? Mr. Nando Ghosh... The one who's blamed for all the mistakes. Don't be mad at him. He belongs to this generation. He knows nothing about you. He thinks it's just stories. He's only heard that his grandfather was a great seeker of truth. Was... Past... I couldn't even find my own son. The truth-seeker has lost his best case... You'll see... He'll return now. He will have to come back. A new case is here it seems... We're supposed to buy a sewing machine today. I'm sure we won't be able to go. Hello. This is Malo. Krishnendu Malo. Krishnendu? So late? I apologise... for calling you so late. I have some information. I'm at the Nonapukur police station Abhimanyu has come back. Abhi? He is back? I am calling you after I saw him. He is confessing to a murder. He has surrendered at the police station. You'll have to come to the police station tomorrow. Murder? Abhi? Who has he murdered? That's what he's claiming. He has surrendered with a bloody knife at the police station. I'm utterly shocked. It's very unfortunate that... that I'm the one giving you this news. NEXT DAY 7:30 AM Hello? Can you hear me? Are you up? Haven't you heard? Why are you bugging me early in the morning? Please, switch on the TV. Call me once you do it. Please call me back. Yes, I'll call you... We are at the Nonapukur police station. Last night, this is where... the son of the famous detective, truth-seeker, Byomkesh Bakshi... Abhimanyu Bakshi surrendered himself. He has been missing for the last two years and now he's in the police lock-up. The famous detective is here with his daughter-in-law. But the most disturbing fact is the body of the victim is missing. An erstwhile icon, is DC Abhimanyu Bakshi involved in a greater conspiracy? Why was he missing? And why did he get involved in a murky murder case on his return? It's all a mystery now. Can Byomkesh Bakshi solve this case? I'll talk to you later. Please come in, sir. - Madam, you're Mrs... - Anusua Bakshi. Abhimanyu's wife. Please take a seat. Poddar, ask Pocha to get some tea and biscuits. - Abhimanyu? - Lock-up... In another room. I'm sure you want to meet him. I didn't even lock his room last night. What can I say, sir? Anusua... - Please go ahead... - And you? I'll come in a bit. Poddar, escort her. - Come right back. - Okay, sir. Please come with me, madam. Sir, please sit. What exactly happened last night? Where do I start, sir? Must have been around 11 o'clock at night. I had dozed off... Suddenly, I see a knife. Blood dripping from it... You'll find the body in the Nonapukur dumpyard. Bring it here. But at the dumpyard... we didn't find any body. I sent a search team in the morning too. They found blood but no body. That's why we haven't filed a case. Abhimanyu Bakshi has been kept in the lock-up based on his confession. He's in a separate cell... You can check... You can bring food for him from home. He's been taken care of... Can I see the murder weapon once? I'll be right outside. Did you come here alone? Your father is here. What a sight, sir! The knife in his hand... Blood dripping from it... I feel nauseous when I see blood... It's not fish blood, sir. Even I smelt it. I would have known if it was fish blood... - Shut up, Poddar. - So sorry, sir. - Thank you... - I couldn't believe it, sir... Abhimanyu Bakshi used to be a shining star of our department I couldn't even recognise him. - Maybe because he was missing for two years... - How far is the... is the place where the murder took place? Must be one kilometre. Right, Poddar? Might be a little more. Is Byomkesh Bakshi trying to solve the murder... The "Dumpyard Murder Case" is getting more complicated. Will truth-seeker Byomkesh Bakshi be able to help his son? What kind of mysteries are being uncovered inside? - Is that Satyaki Bakshi? - Turn the camera around... So, has Satyaki Bakshi come to meet his father Abhimanyu Bakshi? - A good criminal lawyer... - I don't want one. Does Satyaki know? Not yet. I miss him... I've come to this cell after a long time. That day there was only a blanket in the room. Memories rushing back? Yes, 1971... Yes, 1971... My professor, Monotosh Bhattacharya, had come to see his son. There is an uncanny similarity between these two moments. That day too a father had come to meet his long lost son. The charge against him was treason. Who are you rebelling against, Abhimanyu? His nails had been pulled out and his tongue was half burnt. He was screaming while drinking water... All wounds are not physical, Mr. Bakshi. And you can't bring revolution alone. I am a murderer. Please read the police report carefully. He was arrested after being accused of killing a landlord. He had distributed the 4000 bighas of land to the poor farm hands after the murder. He disappeared after some time. Encounter... You know better than anyone that was wrong. What was wrong? Killing the landlord or the encounter? Yesterday's body was also not found. If the body is not found, then there's no point in anything you say. The truth is a little different, isn't it? I'm waiting outside, daughter-in-law. What do you think, Dad? Has he done it? I just remembered there is something I need to do... I'll take care of it. You head home. You can leave and send the OC in. What is the reason for this behaviour? Don't forget you are a DC talking to a killer. Sorry, Senior DC. One star. Where is the body? I don't know. Find it. Someone killed... And then surrendered with a bloody knife at the police station. When did he find time to hide the body? Are you kidding me? We won't be able to save you once we find the body, Abhi. There's still time to change your statement. Say that you murdered in defense. I'll take care of the rest. I don't need any favour. I'm not doing you any favour. This is your friend, not a policeman. So, speak up, buddy, speak up. For old times' sake. Your English has improved. Rapidex? Give me a drag. What happened? I'm allergic to smoke... Please go ahead. Today is Saturday. We have to present him in court on Monday. Send the knife and the blood found at the crime scene to forensics, immediately. So, Mr. Bakshi... I guess you won't need us anymore. Why will you need us when your father is one of the best detectives in the world? I'm still here if you change your mind. Let me know. You go towards a familiar call Come home before night falls You go towards a familiar call Come home before night falls What are you doing here? I thought he was hungry, that's why... I went to get some biscuits. He doesn't look like a street dog. That's what I thought. What's a dog of this breed doing here? I think it's trying to show you something, Satyaki. Go and see... No comments for now. I've posted two cops outside. They'll protect you from harassment. No... There's no need for that. And where is Byomkesh? He got off midway while on our way back from the police station. See, if he can do something... I couldn't make Abhimanyu speak. He's acting weird. Did he tell you anything? Why is Abhimanyu not talking? He's an old friend of yours... Can't you make him talk? I'm questioning him... But he's being so sarcastic while answering As if everyone is his enemy. I think... I think he's depressed... Hello... The body has finally been found... What is going to happen now? It has to be removed before anyone else finds it, Grandad. - No... - But if... I can never let that happen. Are you going to tell the police? - That's the right thing to do, Satyaki? - Right thing? Do you know what will happen when the police gets to know? If we hide the information about the body... it would mean your father has killed this man. I think you've already started believing that. The body has been found. And in that dumpyard. I don't think we can do anything else now. Good bye. Why did Abhi come back? Why did you come back? I heard the news. It's really sad. Very sad... Why do you need Tunna? Hey, what's up? When did you come? I'm leaving for some important work. Why are you still sitiing? Let's go. You can talk at home too... We're not talking... We have some work. That we have to do outside. - Mom, I'll be back soon... - Bye. What are you staring at? Give me some rice. Seems like I'm feeding my enemies. Your dad cracks eggs every morning, right? Every day... four eggs. But he was imagining cracking my head. Shut up and tell me why we have come out? I want to celebrate... I want to drink beer with you. What celebration? The body has been found. Abhimanyu Bakshi will be prosecuted. Thanks to Byomkesh Bakshi. He showed responsibilty, duty, honesty... He has shown how to sacrifice one's own son for it. Bravo, truth-seeker! Bravo! - Satyaki, try to understand... - History has been rewritten today... They'll name a metro station after Grandad soon. "The next station is Byomkesh Bakshi. Platform is on the left side." "The next station is Byomkesh Bakshi. Platform is on the left side." He was killed with something sharp. Most probably a knife... See... - And it was quite far away from... - Have you identified the body yet? We'll find out soon... Don't worry. Paresh, what is the exact time of death? It must be around 10-12 hours ago. I'm guessing between 10 PM and 11 PM last night. Right, Abhimanyu came to me exactly at 11 PM and surrendered. And asked me to inform Malo sir. Mr. Dhar, did you find any dog there last night? Actually I'm really scared of dogs... Can't even get off the car... A Lhasa dog was at the spot. That's why... I didn't see any. Actually, it was so dark that I hardly saw... Sir, there was a dog there when we were bringing the body. - Okay, then... - Excuse me, just a moment. Send the dead body's blood sample to the forensics. Let's see if it matches the blood on Abhimanyu's knife. It won't match. The dead body's blood won't match the blood on Abhimanyu's knife. I am hoping for that too. But we'll have to keep doing our work. Right? Send it, immediately. How is Dipankar Sarkar as a criminal lawyer? I was looking for a good criminal lawyer... I will talk to you later. Do you know where your grandfather is? He's not back yet. He's found the body of the victim, his son has murdered. He's probably roaming around feeling very proud. Mr. Bakshi... Do you smoke? No, sir. I'm trying to quit. - I just couldn't... - Can I say something? - Why don't you buy him a phone? - He doesn't want it. I'm sure he's read somewhere that using mobile phones reduces the sperm count. There's something that bothered me. When you said the blood won't match... I felt that a father could say it but... it didn't sound right coming from Byomkesh Bakshi. You won't even let your grandfather alone. Grandfather! To the success of my legendary grandfather, Byomkesh Bakshi. Cheers! I'm sorry, Krishnendu. It's my fault. He left? The name has lost his zeal. The beer also spilled because I mentioned him. The body would have been found sooner or later. It's not like only your grandfather could have found it. Would you hide it? Of course, I would hide it. This is not expected of you, Satyaki Bakshi. Your grandfather is not back. Aunty is worried. Please go... Don't act like a kid. Kid... Hey, what happened? What's wrong? Charlie Chaplin's "The Kid". Grandad showed me the film. At the Children's FIlm Festival... "The Kid". Guess what we would do after the movie? Then Grandad would scare me... Saying Dad would arrest me for being naughty because he is police officer. You go towards a familiar call Look at me. Look... Do you have so little faith on your father? You can't even look me in the eye? Your father has a lot of time now. Won't you go and meet him? Days and nights, this house All smell of you, darling I'm the desperate light that burns for you You go to whoever wants you Come home before night falls Please tell me before you leave Come home before night falls You go to whoever wants you Come home before night falls Come home before night falls You are allowed to be angry. Your father has been missing for two years. Didn't keep in touch. Suddenly, he has returned as a murderer. You might think why has he come back. What are people calling you? A murderer's son? You've not done it. You're biased. Your father can't kill anyone. That's what you're thinking. Do you want to say something? Do you want to know anything? - What are you doing now? - Research. - Criminal psychology? - No. About the path of light. That's a relief! It's great that you're not trying to show the light to the anti-socials... What do you mean? Criminals... - I have to leave now... - Already... Is your girlfriend waiting for you? Okay. What's her name? Tu... Avantika... Beautiful... Do you know what it means? Bye... If you come to see me once in a while it would be nice. Your tea. Hello. This is Krishnendu. This is Anusua. Tell me. We did a SOS test. According to the results, the blood from Abhimanyu's knife... matches the dead body's blood. That means Abhimanyu... It means Abhimanyu is the murderer. That's what we can conclude. The blood samples are a match. No, no... That's impossible. It can't be... Please sit here... I'll get some candles. Satya, I got this sapling for you. We'll plant it in the garden... What are you looking at? I can't recognise you now. Are you my Byomkesh? Not there... He's not there... How will you save my son? I... have become... very old, Satya... Very old... Actually, you don't believe that my son is innocent. Am I really the truth-seeker? Byomkesh Bakshi? Am I running away? I've always been in pursuit of... I've been chasing truth all my life... I couldn't hold on to my faith... So much love, Satya... There he is. Aren't you Satyaki Bakshi? - I'm your Facebook friend. - So what? - Do you want to say something? - About what? - About the blood samples being a match... - Hurry up... Let's go... - I've nothing to say... - So you agree your dad is the killer? - Can Byomkesh Bakshi... - Can you please leave me alone? Why don't you ask the police what you want to know? Facebook friend... Why were you talking to the press like that? You don't get it. My dad is a murderer and I found the body. I love my father a lot. He never had time for me but... Damn it! What happened? If you react to everything like this... This is not a Byomkesh Bakshi novel... This is my life... Reality... Okay, fine. Why did you go to the dumpyard? To be sure. Are you sure now? Tunna... Tell me... Are you sure now? Satyaki! Ajit, am I running away? - Can you recognise me? - This is midlife crisis... That you're going through right now. Stop pondering over these things and take the book out. See if you can bring the old truth-seeker in you back to life. Can Byomkesh survive without Ajit and Satyaboti? Satyaboti? Satyaboti! Have you ever wanted to be a detective? Let me take this opportunity to tell you... Please buy that sewing machine or there will be hell at home. Gandhi's Non-cooperation Movement started from the inner quarters. Ajit, were you calling me? You tell him... "Aadim Ripu" as in "The First Enemy". "Aadim Ripu"? I don't like darkness, Tunna. I love light. Basically, you're an escapist. You want to avoid darkness. It's my choice. I choose light. Crime, criminals... I can't take it. "Aadim Ripu"... But what will you do, darkness has invaded your space? And you're dumping all the responsibilty on your grandfather? - There's a very easy solution... - Satyaki... - Let go of my hand... Let go... - Satyaki! Satyaki! Satyaki! Get the hell out of here! Did you see that? There's no need for a truth-seeker for them. Just a piece of brick is enough. Just like my dad needs a criminal lawyer right now. Someone who can get him out on bail. That's it. And the case will go on forever. My grandson will solve the case... Simple! Relax... - Are you okay? - Sorry... Did you find Byomkesh? I've found much more than that. Whatever I've asked for, I've received much more. Of course... We're neighbours for a long time. I've given back more than I've received. Ajit, do you want some tea? Do you want some tea too? What is it, Satya? Why are you constantly trying to make me drink tea? Why don't you tell me? Let's see how good you are. You've planted a new sapling in the garden. You need wet tea leaves for the manure. Bravo, Byomkesh! Just wait till it starts flowering. Do you know who guided the Pandavas to heaven? A package was delivered for you. I've kept it outside. Okay. Here, here, here... Come here... Here boy... There you are... What is this doing here? He is the one who showed the Pandavas the path to heaven. How will you survive if you don't eat? What are people calling you? A murderer's son? It's time for you to go now... You couldn't hold on to your faith? BYOMKESH THE COMPLETE STORIES What happened? I think this city still needs the truth-seeker. Siri... What do you think? Something is missing, sir. Oh Moon... Shine your light tonight... Wonderful! Let's catch... some enemies tonight. Yeah, you're looking smart, sir. Still, there's something missing. Are you sure, sir? Now, tell me, Siri? You look hot, sir. And the action begins right after the interval. I heard the knife's blood matched the dead body's blood. I heard it too... I think Dad is being set up. Who are you trying to convince, Satyaki? Here, take this... This is for your partner. Grandad, everyone is trying to prove that Dad is the killer. But there's someone who is trying to help Dad. What do you want? I want to find out the truth. Have you found out who that dumpyard dog belongs to? That dog has never been seen in that area before. It was first seen on the the day of the murder. Where are you going? What about breakfast? Why do you ask so many questions? I never ask you where you go at night? Or who do you meet? Let him go, Anusua. Don't worry. Blood never fails... He has just got addicted to truth. Let's see if he can handle the truth. Dad, your coffee. - Your coffee... - Have you seen the fish? They'll keep eating, if you keep feeding them. They'll burst from eating too much. They've no idea how much they should eat. It's the same with you... And whose fault is it? Mine. I got you the car but you use it to ferry around the Bakshi family. - You'll serve as their driver... - Excuse me? Satyaki drives the car himself. I don't have to drive. You've always misbehaved with Satyaki every time he has come home. He tolerates it because he comes from a good family. He comes from a good family that's why he visits his dad in the lock-up. And who does he have for company? His girlfriend... Good boy, my foot! The murder victim is a professional hitman. His name is Kartik. Abhimanyu must have killed him to save his own life. But who would hire a hitman to kill him? And in that case he could have said that it was self defense. I don't get it. Have you been able to figure something out? There's only one thing I can understand. That there's more to come... My intuition says... But I'm his father. Maybe I'm blinded with love. It's best if I stay out of it. I want to say something. And that's why I've come here today. Before he went missing, he was having trouble with a man. A very powerful man. You can't blame your dad. I'm a murderer's son. All fathers will talk like that. What rubbish! My dad never liked you. And I have no idea why. Hey, I need to show you something. What is it? Was delivered by courier yesterday. A+... Blood?! He used to threaten to kill Abhimanyu. Abhimanyu had stopped the construction of apartments near the Rajarhat wetlands. He would receive threats over the phone. Sorry... Who sent this? I've no idea... Who sent it? Why me? What are they trying to say? You know what my intuition is telling me? This blood will match the blood on the knife that Dad surrendered. In fact, he tried to bribe Abhimanyu. But things went downhill after that. A truck almost ran him over after two days. He was saved within an inch of his life. He bruised his head. What happened, Abhi? - It's nothing... - Let me see... The car lost control... and hit a wall. It's just a scratch. Doc has given me a lot of anti-biotics. It'll heal soon. We need information about the blood. Any idea who can give us the information? How about we call the blood bank? Gandhamardhan Hills or what? I've always believed that man... has tried to kill Abhimanyu. Who is he? Hello... Subimal, this is Satyaki. Yes, tell me. I need your help. Would be easier to explain in person. I'll be there in half an hour. Where are you? We are at... the Royal Bengal Tiger Cafe in Tollygunge. What is it? Okay... We'll wait for you here. Okay. One more thing... Don't tell anyone else. It's confidential. Okay. I'm on my way. Subimal was Dad's junior. He's very close to our entire family. And I think he's gay. His sexual orientation has nothing to do with the case, I guess. Yeah, you're right. He likes me a lot. And I like him too. - You could've told me before. - Hey, where are you going? - Did he get the wetlands back? - No, it's still disputed. If Abhimanyu comes back, there'll be more trouble for him. From Subimal? From Grandad... For you... He said, this rose and my blood group are the same. Get it, my partner? First decide who you like more. Excuse me, I must go now. I have a meeting. You should talk to Abhimanyu. There's no point. - He's waiting. - Waiting for what? We'll have to wait and watch. I guess your partner has arrived. When the bribe didn't work, he tried to run Abhimanyu over with a truck. Then your father went missing. Do you think that man got to know that Dad is back? Then he hired someone to kill Dad. And Dad... murdered in self defense. I have another information. Shots were heard that night around the dumpyard area about 11 o'clock. - Gun shots? - Firing? Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! I'm going to meet Abhi. But Anusua... We didn't get the promoter's name. Do you have Subimal's number? Who is that man? Hello. Subimal, my father-in-law wants to talk to you. Yes... Subimal... You didn't tell us that man's name. Which man? Oh, that promoter? Anirudhha Raychaudhuri. Anirudhha Raychaudhuri, the promoter... Lives in Alipore. He has other businesses too... You're wrong. - What do you mean? - Listen, Tunna... - There can be many promoters named... - Shut up. - Why are you lying? - Listen to me... - Sorry... Shut your mouth... Shut your mouth. Why are you lying? - Tell me... - Tunna, listen to me... Where are you going? Tunna, listen to me. Give me a minute please. Couldn't you call me even once in the last two years? A letter? Or a message... For the person who is still alive. Why are you so angry? You won't even say a word? Did the flowers bloom in the garden? It was my mom's favourite. Give them the file, Abhi. There's still time. Please give it to them. At least, now I know for sure that the file is not with them yet. That's enough. May I come in? Your chargesheet. Hearing is day after tomorrow. See if everything is in order. Day after tomorrow? That's a long way off. It's not a very long way off, Abhi... You don't get it. You think a miracle will happen. You think the sea is going to part and Moses is going to walk... That's not going to happen. It's a myth. I thought, you would say... Osman, if you question me... then my answer will... This prisoner is my beloved. Let me see... He's completely lost his mind. I'll say it again... Listen, Osman... This prisoner is my beloved. No one else will ever find a place in my heart in my life. Just remembered... I usually keep it here... A full box of bullets. Where can it disappear? And I was with Kinkar at the club the day of the incident. If you don't believe me, you can call him and ask. Where are the four bullets? What do you mean by four bullets? Those four are always empty. I only keep two bullets in the gun. I don't use my gun to kill people. It's for self defense. What are you trying to say? Didn't you threaten Abhimanyu uncle? Didn't you try to bribe him? - And the truck... - What is she talking about? Excuse me... Have you seen a small dog here? Very furry? Dog? No, no... Did you hear gunshots at night? Three-four shots... Gunshots? No, no... Please believe me... I just wanted to scare him. And because he wasn't scared, you wanted to kill him. Dad, please give yourself up. There's still time... Nothing will happen to you. Nothing will happen to you... Mom, say something. Is there any vet clinic nearby? My Tuktuk has fever. - No idea. - Okay, thank you. Excuse me. Are you sure there is a vet clinic nearby? I've heard there is one. But I don't know the exact location. Thank you. Siri, can you find me the nearest veterinary clinic, please? Go straight. Does anyone come to your clinic with a Lhasa? Yes, we get a few Lhasa... Has anyone come in with a white Lhasa recently? - White Lhasa? - Yes. Mr. Acharya has a white Lhasa. Turn right. He lives close by. Walk 100 meters. Can you give me his address? It's very urgent. Please. Yes, one second. Please take it down. And you'll find your destination on the right. Hello? If my father is guilty. Then I'm guilty too. My love for you is true but I'll never face you again. I promise. This is not... the right time to talk about this. I'm in the middle of something. Talk to you later, please. Bye. Wake up... It's late. Don't you have to go to the market? Your tea... I'm keeping it on the table. Where were you all this while? I finished all the household chores. Gosh! Why this now? Look at the how wet the nozzle is from the dew in the morning. It smells of soap. Are you giving your gun a bath these days? Or did you take the print on soap to get a duplicate made for your grandson? You can replicate a revolver like this? Might not be able to do it for a revolver but definitely for a knife. Isn't it, Byomkesh? Didn't you smell soap on the knife at the police station? Who might be calling right now? Hello. This is Subimal. Mr. Bakshi, you're right. Something has happened. What happened? Another murder. The owner of the dog was found murdered. And your grandson has found the body. What is the name of the man? Acharya? It seems the murder weapon is a knife. The smell is highly unhygenic. There's only one glass. Don't think there was anyone else in the room. Seems like it. But one slice of pizza has only chilli flakes and the other one has only oregano. That means there was someone else in the house last night. Bravo, young man! You are living up to the Bakshi name! The police couldn't find the dog's owner and you did? They just had to ask the local vet clinic to find out. If the dog belongs to him... But what was it doing there? - What's his name? - Chandrashekhar Acharya. Strange! How did Byomkesh Bakshi know? He used to live here on rent for two years. But no one knows what he used to do. But people had seen him walking the dog. What is the time of death? Paresh, can you tell us the time of death? The body is here for two days. Can't tell you the exact time of death without post mortem. Two days mean before Kartik was killed? From the wound it looks like the same murder weapon was used. Sharp... Two and a half inches... How big was Kartik's wound? Two and a half inches. Sir... Will you look into this, Paresh? It means both the murders were committed by the same person. How did the dog go missing? Check the local dumpyard. You might find it there. You mean it's dead and gone? I found some dog vomit close to the dumpyard. And some fur too. Maybe it was dragged after it was killed. The killer must have smoked a lot. I found a lot of local cigarette butts. - Can I tell you something? - What? - You should be a detective... - No, I can't... - Trust me... - I'm happy with research. What are you researching? Optical research in to the spectral decomposition of light. Wow! Einstein had worked on it. I'm just building up on it. It's absolutely brilliant, sir! According to preliminary investigation, both murders happened last night. And the murder weapon is the same knife. So, Abhimanyu will be charged with double homicide. I knew something like this would happen. This was suppossed to happen. I think... how would it be if this rose was black? Have you ever seen a black rose? It's found in a place called Halfeti in Turkey. It's very rare. I have a very strong urge to see it. Black rose! You may leave now. Do you want him to hang because you're treating this investigation like a hobby? Please stop it. Please save your son. Doesn't matter if Lord Krishna doesn't help... His charioteer, Satyaki, is on our side. For thousand years... I've walking this Earth... Far away from the sea into the darkness... I've travelled to the depths of the ocean... I want to know a few things, Dad. Please tell me the truth. Do you want some tea? There's a really great tea place close by. They make great eggs... Do you want some? Can I get it for you? You can see how well they're treating me. Thanks to your grandfather. Don't forget the post you held in police. In fact, you still do. Unless you're conv... Can I ask you the questions? Number one... The entire thing is your plan. I've had a song stuck in my head for a long time. And you know I'm really not that interested in music... Dad, I didn't ask you... But I couldn't remember the line? What was it? The secrets... won't remain... secrets anymore The secrets... won't remain... secrets anymore You'll find the song on my phone. That means you believe that your father has murdered those people. And now you can't even look at me and talk. Why are you crying? Hey, silly girl! I'll tell you everything. Just give me some time. Actually, I wasn't confident before. But now, I am. - What is this? - Pizza bill. - Wear your glasses. - Oh, yeah. I found this bill at the Acharya residence. I found it in the same room as the dead body. The pizza was ordered at 11:15 PM. - That means Acahrya was still alive. - Right. And Dad surrendered at the police station at 11 PM. If the same knife was used in both the murders, then Dad didn't commit the second crime either. - That's what the timeline says. - That's right. Now I have to find out who sent me the courier. Where are you going? I have some work, baby. I'll come with you... - Listen, Tunna... - Am I not your partner? Ajit, the number of birds are dwindling... After the Soviet Union broke up... Even the migratory birds have stopped coming. That's why I'm making these birds. I'll put them in our garden. Satyaboti can watch them from the window. With your little son? There's nothing to worry about. I'm prescribing some medicines keeping his age in mind. Keep him on a liquid diet at night. Did you see the man's face? Please, let him sleep. Okay. Did he take anything? Only Grandad can tell you. Only he knows what treasure he hides in this house. Treasure... Well said! I'll come back tomorrow in the morning. Goodbye. My glasses... So many birds... This is my Granny. She is much better looking... Come here... Do you want to say something, Grandad? I didn't get it... But I did. You sent me the courier, didn't you? How far is the police station from the dumpyard? Around one kilometer. All this way, the blood kept dripping... from the knife? It's impossible. I found the pouch in a park near the police station. I just remembered something I have to do... You head home. But it's not evidence. I'm certain of it. Because there are no nursing homes or hospitals close by.. Abhimanyu put the blood on the knife in the park. - After that he surrendered... - But why? Then who is the murderer? Why did he put the blood on the knife? Why would Dad do something like this? "To go wrong in one's own way..." "is better than to go..." "right in someone else's." Grandad? What was the thief looking for in your room? He was looking for a file... What file? Avantika... Don't smoke too much. How did you know? Holmes would have said... he noticed the tobacco stains on the lips and fingers. You smoke lights... You don't smoke the strong stuff anymore. Then? You had become quite fidgety. You need a smoke, don't you? Do you have a cigarette? Do you want to smoke? Leave one with me. Your birds are beautiful. Will you give me one? I'll keep it. You'll get one... Okay, I'll see you later. "The one who will slay you is growing up in Gokul." "The answer will be given by..." "...the successor." Treasure... What can it be? May be it's in Grandad's room. May be it's not. File... In Dad's room... Your father... High profile... investigation... Which means hardcopy. Softcopy means a laptop... Dad's laptop. Password? Password? Password? Abhimanyu? Anusua? 1972? Done! I have something to say to you. Yes, tell me. I know you won't listen to me. But I'm going to say it anyway. I don't want you to get involved in all this. I'm not involved in anything. Do whatever you decided to do. Go abroad to continue your research. But Dad has to come back for that. I can't leave you and Grandad here and take off. That's why I'm just making sure that Dad comes home soon. I am... I am very tired, Satyaki... You knew everything, Grandad. Everything! That's why your father is so angry with me. It is a war of roses, Satyaki. Your Dad's red rose and my black one. Wait... Take this with you. You might need it. Go... You've hidden from the truth only once in your life. And this is how I'm paying for my mistake. Penance... Do you want to see a rose, Satya? A black rose? Are you feeling scared of me? You think... You think I'm cruel... Just think about that day... when God had created the black rose. What was he going through? Where's the file? There's still time. Just give me the file. All this will be over. File... Gone... The file is not there. - Did it just vanish? - Yes. Then face the consequences, Abhimanyu Bakshi. - It was flown away... - Even your father won't be able save you... And you'll not need this anymore. Now, no one will hear you... You're doomed. You're stuck in your own maze, Abhimanyu. Let's see how this night ends. - Why did you call me here? - Because your dad is home. - We have to do some work. - What do you mean? I've to get back home right away. Do you know what time it is? You can't come along? I'm really sorry I called you so late at night. It's my problem and I'll deal with it. I don't need anyone's help. - Please go back home... It's late... Sorry. - Listen up... Wait... Aren't you getting late? Go home... Why are you coming with me? - What's wrong with you? - I can't explain right now. Are you coming? I have two... foot imprints... In red... Both are old. One is my mother's and the other is Satyaboti's. I can't figure out which one is whose. What should I do? All your confidence is just for show. You're feeling very weak, aren't you? What is it? Please tell me what's wrong. I don't want to continue, Tunna. I don't want to see how this ends. What happened, Satyaki? Do you love me? Will you love me even if the world comes to an end? Satyaki, what's wrong with you? Why are you behaving like this? What happened? Satyaki... Why did you come to the terrace? I couldn't find you downstairs. Do you want to tell me something? I have read the file, Anusua. I know. A police officer in a high post is running the entire racket. The name is mentioned in the file. K. M. K.M.? Krishnendu Malo? What are we doing at the station? If my name is Satyaki Bakshi, then this case will be solved tonight. I have no idea what you are... Can you tell me what this is? An impression. Of what? A knife. When I went to meet Abhimanyu at the police station that night... I saw the murder weapon for the first time. It smelt of soap. Someone had taken an impression of the knife. Who could have done it? The night Abhimanyu surrendered, who else was there at the police station? This is Malo. Krishnendu Malo. Malo. I found out from the OC... someone else was also there... Hungry elephant, looking for food... The prince and princesses, good kids turn naughty today... What are you trying to do? See there... Exactly what I thought. It's all adding up. Look... It says clearly in Abhimanyu's report. There are two people working together in this city. One is Acharya. And the other person is K.M. Who is Acharya? And who is this K.M.? Please tell me something. I'll tell you everything. Remember the pizza bill? The order at 11:15 PM? That was the pizza delivery boy's last order. That's why he remembers clearly. I've asked him. When he went to Acharya's place, there was another man with him. They were drinking. He had seen a strange ring... It had a big, blue, round stone on it. The second man was wearing it. Does the name sound familiar? Look... What did I tell you? - Buckle up. - Why? Where are you going now? We have to follow them. One more car... When clouds darken the sky And you've walked all the way Let's just be together now Abhimanyu had hidden his treasure with his father. "Aadim Ripu". I have no idea when he did it. But I've been able to protect it for so long. This is my only achievement. Take it. "Aadim Ripu". I'm burnt out I've sunken many boats The sea makes no difference Between the sailor or lover Lonely in neglect How do we prove... Abhi's innocence? Exactly the way he was proven guilty. Kartik's blood was matched with the blood on the knife. Come home before night falls Go to the one who is your own Come home before night falls You're probably thinking I've brought you here to kill you. No... You're trying to save my life. You are going to die if you don't hand over the file. Did Senior Bakshi say that? Yes, Mr. Byomkesh Bakshi had said. But the microphone was my idea. No matter what you think, I did it for you. Want a drag? You are a coward. You've asked another police officer to back down. I have no evidence, Abhi. - Take me back to the lock-up. - You're not safe there. I have to go back. Hey, ready or not here I come. Subimal Kanti Mondal. K.M. I have no idea. Do you have any idea about what's happening? That day when you called Subimal... I saw it on your phone too. When... Subimal told me... Mr. Bakshi, you were right. There's been another murder. I asked him on purpose... What is the man's name? Acharya? I wanted him to know that I've read the report. That I know everything. That it's with me. That's why he attacked this room. You ran away with the file to save your life. Didn't you? Now, you've come back prepared. You thought, by surrendering, creating a ruckus, involving the media... If you get locked up, no one can touch you. The lock-up is the safe space, right? You just poked me and ran back to safety. You thought you could just hand me over to the CID. Don't worry. The body will be sent to the dumpyard in the morning. Good night. Why did you kill Acharya? Were you scared? He would expose you if he was arrested. Abhi, careful. You knew I would arrest him first. Am I right? If someone confesses to murder... As a police officer, isn't it my duty to find him a body, sir? I had seen Kartik's body. He was murdered only five or six hours before. But the forensics guy said... It seems he's been dead for 10-12 hours. That's why... I took the forensics guy's number from Subimal. Subimal, I can't understand which one is whose. What should I do? He gave me Paresh's number. I realised they are quite close. Yes? Kartik wasn't murdered at night. What? He was killed the next morning, isn't it Paresh? Who is this? Byomkesh Bakshi. One minute. Why is Paresh calling now? Your father is busy with your mother and grandmother's foot prints. I'm just helping him figure it out. That's it. Ready or not, here I come... Can I call Satyaki? Don't... Satyaki is on the battlefield. My weapon is with him. But sir, I have my license. And I was right there. Here's my license. Why are you bugging me now? I'm in the middle of a game? Sir, Byomkesh Bakshi knows everything. Byomkesh knows everything? Everything? Then, we should send him another foot print, right? - Subimal! - Welcome... Please join us. I've brought the report. Let him go. Subimal figured out... It was Abhimanyu's plan. He hired Kartik to kill Acharya. Hello, Kartik? Yeah... That Acharya... walks his dog every morning... at the dumpyard. Got it? One stone to kill two birds. Acharya dies and we get a body. Abhimanyu would be trapped in his own maze... Gotcha! The initial plan was to kill Acharya... and dump the body in a car nearby. What happened? He's still not here. He'll come for sure. Is the dog constipated? I'll go and check. But Acharya never went to the dumpyard in that morning. Maybe he drank too much the night before. - It's done. - Great! Now hide the body in a car. But there's a problem in that. He never went to the dumpyard. I had to do the job at his home. What have you done? But the job is done... My money... Shut up! Come to the dumpyard. Come to the dumpyard right now! Okay, I'm coming. The dead body... Would have been better if it was found a few days later. Then the murder's time can be meddled with. But... The dog can't stay either. It's evidence after all... That's why, Subimal poisoned the dog too... Following the dog... If Satyaki didn't trace Acharya residence... The two murders... would not be linked. They would have remained completely separate events. I'm feeling very scared today. Will everything be destroyed today? Satya... Take it. What took you so long? Hope you got here without trouble. I've been waiting for so long for you. "Aadim Ripu"? Brilliant! Have been looking for it everywhere. You rascal! You've been hiding the treasure in this trashy novel. Let him go. Let him go! I can't let him go. It's impossible. That was the deal. You'll let him go once you get the report. That was two years back, Anusua. He was missing then... He has reappeared now. How can I let him know? It's not possible. Wonderful! Come on over! - Satyaki is here... - Satyaki... Let's catch some rats now. Who says our police don't work? I was driving without my license. It's a criminal offence. Sorry, I'm a little late. Thanks, Mom. You showed me where to go. Oh... Anusua showed you the way. Come join us... We're playing... No, I want to know about the game you were playing before. I'm building a dollhouse... You want to know about the game? Mrs. Bakshi will tell you. Hey, talk to me! Anusua, let them about the game... It's best to get all the embarrassing secrets out in the open. What if it becomes breaking news in the morning? Mom, you're not answerable to anyone... Mom, please... I have made mistakes. I wanted to leave... But it was too late. Everyone will be good... I'll be bad... I've been quiet for a long time. I haven't said a word. I was waiting for you to make a few mistakes, Subimal. And you've made mistake after mistake. To frame me... And when you realised that... You came out to kill me. You've come to catch me. Can I say something? No... We can't hide the truth anymore. Everything is out in the open. We're only waiting for the right moment. This happened a long time ago... I had just started the investigation into arms smuggling. Very confidential... No one knows... Subimal's phone is tapped. - Hello... Tell me... - Hello. We have to meet. - When do you want to come? - As soon as possible. What's the hurry? I want to ask you something. What is it? Tell me. - Not over the phone. - Why? - Can't tell you on the phone... - Oh, you want to come close... Naughty... But I still wanted to see the evidence with my own eyes. I followed her. When I saw Anusua entering Subimal's house. I knew I've lost the battle. The only way left for me then was exile... The day before I left, when I came back home... No one was there. Only Dad was there. I'm leaving, Dad. I'm leaving the report behind. I'm leaving it to fate. Let's see what happens. You should've given Anusua more time. You knew everything, Dad. Why didn't you tell me? I felt it... Aren't you the truth-seeker? Your own home was on fire and you... You kept it from your son? I was scared. I was scared for the first time in my life. I had hoped everything will be fine. You felt weak when it came to your son? It's all over, Dad. No... Everything will be alright once I leave. Where will you go? I don't know. - Are you going to lose? - I've already lost, Dad. I've lost. Once you've lost the battle from inside, you can't fight anymore. Are you going to give me such a huge punishment? I am punishing myself, Dad. I went to Subimal that day... to tell him that I wanted to break up with him. But he didn't let go... You thought I was a safe bet. No one will suspect that you were having an affair with me. Am I right? And you want to break up the moment your husband has found out. Your husband will win medals and I'll be hanged. Is that it? If I go down, I'll take you with me... Otherwise, you'll get me... the report from wherever you can. And guess what? Your husband... is tapping my phone. And what is there on my phone? You and me... Just see... Look at us. We look so good together. Look at us. I am not that careless, Anusua... I'm a little careless with my heart but not with my phone... Look at the screen... Look at it... - Anu, should we show them the photos? - Hey... I'll kill you! Little boy... Your game is over. - No... - Game over. - Subimal, no... - Give up... You've lost... One... Two... B****! He took advantage of my loneliness... my weakness. There should be punishment for that. Osman! This prisoner is my beloved. No one else can take his place in my heart ever... - That's what I had gone to tell him... - Mom... - That's all I went to say... - Mom... Mom... Please Mom. - That's all... - Mom, please don't be like this... - Dad, please say something... - That's all I wanted to say. That's all I wanted to say... Mr. Subimal, here's a another one from the Bakshi Family. Satyaki! I'm sorry... Dad. I want to come back home. Please come... I'll be waiting for you. For the last two years... I've wondered when you'll forgive me... and come back home. We'll have our morning tea together. Come home, son... Bring Anusua back. I'm coming, Dad. And I'm coming with her. I'm coming soon. Satya... Can you make some tea? Take your farewell now Who are you going on for? - What about my dad? - He is a promoter... He's just a local goon. Nothing more than that. - I want tea... - Siri, tea shop, please. Your grandson is quite clever. He already has two female assistants. One digital, one visible. You are very lucky... Not me... That's not going to happen. I'm going to write a novel on this case of yours. Satya, can you smell it? Your plant is flowering... Ajit... Name the novel, "Goodbye Byomkesh". Hey... Then one who is not done, how can he say the last words? Appears like a wound... Burns like fire...
