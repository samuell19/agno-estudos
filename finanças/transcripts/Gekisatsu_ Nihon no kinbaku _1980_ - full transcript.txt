I've heard from my friend in a secret service, a lot of cholera going round there Purgeing corrupt elements would eventually be a consequence of protecting us. But who can purge a cholera germ? Right. We could save our times if we force them into a hunger and dryness. There would remain dead bodies of worm and hungry kids chewing leaves on a tree. So, Kimura, drink it up. Hey, Kimura. I think Kan nation of China is great. They have a orient eastern morality since early times. No matter how they gets thirst, never drink a stolen fountain. Dying without stealing other's possessions... Admirable. Hey, you. Please let me go. A secret meeting again? Huh?

Like, why I am a prostitute. Or if I was born poor. Or if I was cheated by men... How stupid it is. They feel better if a girl they bought is poor. And they're happy to hear that well-brought-up girls get depressed. What a lonely story. You are right. When they wanna play around, should just do so. Have you heard that our business would be unable to do? It's not gonna change. But I've heard It will be decided at the Diet. What was it....? It's the Anti-Prostitution Law.

Sorry my baby. You look good in a Cina dress. A Cina dress? Right. People used to call China, "Cina". a-ha. A long time ago? Yes, it is. It's a long time ago. But you're still alive. You are a mysterious girl. A girl just like a rejuvenating drug. So, now. Why don't you take my assistance? I never let you feel uncomfortable. I feel relived, by being with you. Alright, I'll think about it. Because I don't like being poor. Oh, it's amazing. Didn't work until now. Ah Well, touch it. a virgin... a girl... Although young girl is green, You are sexually attractive. Does it remind you the war? what? The best memories of the war. What is it? What do you mean? I'm 18. My mother was also 18 when I was born.
