THE LAST SUMMER OF LA BOYITA Hold tight! Turn it around... The big ones go in this box. No, don't touch that. The books go in this box, here. On Sunday, the doctor comes and takes everything. The large ones, here. In this corner. The American President, Ronald Reagan, declared today... Leave the diplomas, I will take care of them. They're sacred. And the jars too. Watch the LPs! Be careful! Hand me that too. ...La Favorita Department stores take you to the Mexico Soccer cup... See if you can put this... No, no, do not touch that. Done. You can leave now. CHILDHOOD ADOLESCENCE Just the blackheads. Stay still, here's an enormous one. Ouch! Let's go to the river for a while? I can't. Come on! Why not? I can't get in the water until tomorrow. Does it hurt? It's weird, like having a cramp here... Ouch! You're hurting me! That's enough. I swear that one was black! I'm getting deformed. You're beautiful. Throw the ball! Quiroga! Here! Here! Lu! Lu! Throw it! Lu! Luciana! Throw it! Gast?n! Gast?n! Quiroga! -How disgusting! Don't pee! -I'm not peeing! I felt it. You're worse than a dog. -I wasn't peeing! -Don't come in all wet! I wanna pee. Get out! You already peed in the shower. -Let me in! -Jorgelina, Ieave me alone. I need privacy, get it? And I need to go poo. Open! How come all your panties rip in the same place? I kept that one because I'm going to sew it myself. You're going to damage your inner piece of fabric, and no one is going to be able to sew that for you. How come you're still awake? -Hi, honey. -Hi, Mom! What's that magazine? It's Peca's. Did you go to the club today? Yes, but we couldn't swim because Jorgelina has lice. And she couldn't, because of her ''thing''... We ended up going to the river. All mud. But she didn't go in. Enough... What's this? Peca gave it to me. I've learned to pray. Don't let Grandma Sara see it. Why not? It's like a fairy, right? She'll keep me company when Lu moves out. Sure. As you wish, sweetie. Now go to sleep, my little pickle head. -Do you like it, Lu? -I love it. -I think it looks better here. -Yeah. Let's see. Here. Ready. Jorgelina, I need the bathroom. Come in. I can't, with you there... Get out. What? You need privacy? Enough with the bidet! You've been watering yourself for an hour. You'll grow moss between your legs. I'd rather grow moss than hair. Like it or not, it'll happen. It's called becoming a woman. Where are you going? -Downtown. -Wait, I'm coming too! You can't, we're going to the movies. You have to be 14 to get in. But you're not 14! -But we can pass, and you can't. -Sure, I can. -Stay with Peca and watch TV. -I don't want to stay with Peca. -Come on, don't be a tag-a-long! -I am not! Tag-a-long! Little girl! Tomboy! Jorgito! Leave me alone, you dwarf! I want to leave. -Let me go! -I hate you! Ouch! Get out! Lunatic! Jor... Jojo... Open up, baby... Don't call me baby. Come on, Jor... I've already told you, I'm not going to Gesell Beach. But you love the sea... The beach is boring. And what'll you do? Lock yourself in the Boyita aII summer? No. I'm going to the country, with Dad. If you want, I can give you a phone I don't use anymore. Cool! Your new room looks nice. -You like this? -No. You need a push-up bra, that one flattens you. Try this on. You need a pair of shorts, like these, you can't wear those. Gesell Beach is going to be such fun! All the boys from the club are going. We're going to have such a good time, you'll see! Hey, Princess... We're here. Come, Quiroga! -Good morning, Elba. -'Mornin' Doctor. The fields looked quite dry... It's been hot... How long since it last rained? Two weeks. One, two, three, four, five... What have you got there, Quiro? There's a dead bird in my room! Go in and take it out! It's disgusting! I hadn't seen you. Were you out in the fields? Yep. -How are you? -OK. You want to go to the tajamar? I have to work. I can wait for you until you're done. It'll be dark by then. -Good morning. -Good morning. Thanks. What is it? Pig's head cheese. Oh, I can't then. I'm Jewish. Mario! Did you see my Dad? -He's with the Engineer. -Do you want to swim? I gotta work. Come on, just a little bit. Saddle Margarita for me. You sleep here now? Since when? End of winter. I sleep on my own now, too. At my house in Rosario. -D' you make them? -Yes. -You liked the books I sent you? -Yes. I started that one about the horse... Let's go. -Luciana? -Fine. Were you given summer homework? I'm done with school. What about high school? Is she coming? No, she went to the beach with my Mom. Better, because she's been unbearable since she got it. -Got what? -Got... You know. The thing, Billy... Her monthly Bill. The menstruation! The blood! My Dad told me you were gonna race this year. Yup. -With Yayo? -Yup. On the 14th. -Can I go? -If you want. Hold tighter! Tight! It's a pit viper skin. Pretty big. When they shed their skin they get fiercer. You coming in? How is your homework coming along? Jorgelina! Mario dropped out of school. Well, it's different here. Oscar needs help and Mario isn't a kid anymore. We're going to the race, aren't we? Of course, it's important for Mario and his family. He'll be testing himself as a man. Why does he have to test it? In case he doesn't like it? No, I mean, to prove himself... to show he's a man. And how will he show it? That's how things are here. I went to the tajamar. Wear your boots, it's snake season. -And don't go alone... -I know... He'll be a good butcher too. Really? And does he heIp you? Yes... he does. He's good, uh? -Yeah... -he can ride alright. -And how is your back? -So-so. I brought you the medicine. Remind me. Thank you, Doctor. Go, Mario! Come on, faster. Hold him! Faster! That one. Take off your shirt, at least. I'm not hot. No, you're sweating because you're so cold... -'Afternoon. -'Afternoon. -How are you, Don Welschen? -Fine, doctor, thanks. -What wouId you like, kids? -A coke and a cookie. -And you, ''Marito''? -Nothing. Two cokes, two cookies and a shot for me. -Dad? -Yeah? -Can I call Mom? -Sure. Here. Thanks. -Here you go, Welschen. -OK. I'll be back. You want a sip of wine, Marito? It's good for the heart. Hi... Is Lu there? I just wanted to say hi. So, ready for the 14th? We're all bettin' on Yayo. Not everybody... Claudio is goin' around challenging everybody... But he doesn't have a horse any more! But the Devil never sIeeps... Watch out! The bocci courts are pretty full today. Yeah. We're doing fine. -Let's go ou'side! -We're goin' ou'side... Don't make fun of me, kid! Can you make a snack with salami Don Welschen? Sure... Short throw... Short bocci. Ugly toss! So, Marito, have you finished your cookie? And your milk? Go! Come on, pal. Closer! Who can take it out now? Go! You are an expert! Yayo is doin' good, but the rider is a greenhorn... Which was? The red one... Here's a guy who'd pay good money for tha' horse... And knowing Oscar couId need it... Father and son, hearts full of pride and pockets empty. -Hi everyone. -Hi. Have to take it out now! This is for the little lap dog. -Upa! -Good one! Far, too far! Last one... -Cheers! -Cheers! Let's go. Uh? That was a good one! Can you saddle Margarita for me? The doctor is riding her. Where d' ya wanna go? Come on! Go in! I don't want to! -A snake! -Where? You liar! I'll get you for that! Why don't you wanna go in? This water is treacherous. Come on, I prefer to be bitten by a bug than roasting here. Is it because of that? Does it hurt? Did your Dad... hit you? He's thirsty, I'm gonna give him some water. Mario, you're bleeding, you must have cut yourself on the tree trunk. Let's go see my Dad. No, I don' need a doctor. But Mario, you're bleeding. I'll go change. -Are you alright? -Yes. I'll bring you some tea. If you see my mom, don't tell her. D' you need anythin'? Yes, please, a cup of tea. I don't feel well. Shall I go get the doctor? No. It's just a stomache-ache, it'll go away. Are you still bleeding? -Is this Yayo? -Yes. Are you sure you don't want my Dad to see you? I think it's the blood. You must have got cut. The menstruation. No, that only happens to girls. Anyhow, don't tell anyone. Could you make some mate, Elba? Shall we go to Gualeguaychu this weekend? Yep. Come on, you love Carnaval parades. -How are you feeling? -Fine. Jor, dinner's ready! Hold it for me, don't let anyone see it. I'm not like those pictures. That's because you're changing, it's adolescence. I'm not normal. I'm not so normal either. This... wasn't done by anybody. It's not a cut. Well... my grandma has a moustache. Anyway, I like you as you are. Mario! Mario! Mario! Go Mario! Go, Yayo, go! Good, Mario! Bravo Mario! Can you help me? Bye! Smukler needs an extra hand. Mario couId... Mario has to train for the race. Jorgelina is stuck to him, I don't think it's... Stop nagging! Here, try this on. Try them. Come on! Get that wig off! Get ready. You're goin' to the Smukler's. What about trainin' for the race? Take Yayo with you. Where's Mario? He's at the Smukler's. He'll be back tomorrow. But doesn't he have to practice? He has to work. Which is the subject? The girls? No, don't guess... Do as I explained: Who makes the soup? I don't know, I don't understand when you explain... You don't understand because your mind is elsewhere... No, you don't explain well... Can we go to Welschen's? I wanna call Mom. Hi, Mom! How are you? I'm... How is the sea? That's the one that is with Mario. No, I'm not sad. Fine. Did you know he's gonna race this year? And Lu? Dad! Mom wants to talk to you... Excuse me... -Where were you? -Workin'. You're still bleeding. -That's just mud. -It's not mud. Mario, what if you die. -Let's call my Dad. -No. Hi. Dad... Yeah? We're almost done. When people get their menstruation... When girls get their menstruation is because... I know about the girls. Explain about the boys. Boys don't menstruate. But they bleed, don't they? No, if a boy bleeds, it's because he's got an infection, some problem. And he can die? What's the matter? It's a secret, promise me you won't say anything. What's wrong? Promise... You promised... He'll think I'm a tattle-tale. I have to see him, Jor. It might be serious. If it is, you're helping him. Mario! Mario! Mario? With Yayo I think. You need somethin'? I'll fetch him... No, it's okay. Is he well? Yeah, sure. When he comes back, tell him to come and see me. Okay. Excuse me, can I come in? I heard you had a fever these days. Where does it hurt you? It doesn't hurt anymore. Where did it hurt? Can I? Let's see, lie down here, please. That's right. Let me see. Breathe deeply. Since when has this been happening? Since the Winter. How many times? Four... or five times. What is it? Nothing. Well, we might have to run some tests... But don't worry... When he was born, the doctor said it would grow... and if it stayed the same a year later, we shouId go to Paran? for some medical studies. But as he's always been so healthy, we didn't worry much about it, except that it didn't grow no more. But why didn't you consult me? That was years ago doctor, before you bought this farm. And later? We didn' wanna bother you. And he was fine, he's healthy... But if he had had some tests... He's healthy, he doesn't need tests. And you hadn't noticed anything lateIy? About... six months ago he had a pain. We took him to the hospital 'cause he was bleedin'. They thought it was a urinary infection. So they did some tests. -Do you have them? -Yes. Can I see them? ...pelvis structure... compatible with uterus... Didn't any doctor see this scan? I saw that the doctor had a weird expression, he said a specialist in Buenos Aires would have to see him. And anyway, some days later the pain and the bleeding stopped. And then it was harvest time and Oscar said we couldn't go... and so we never did. How come you never told me? Because he got better! Listen... Elba... what women have, the clitoris, Mario also has, but much bigger. That's why when he was born they made a mistake. But doctor! How couId they make such mistake? He menstruates, he's growing breasts. You can take some days off, go to Buenos Aires. If you want, I can heIp you find some treatment... How am I gonna tell Oscar... Do you want me to speak to him? No, I have to tell him. But do it soon, for Mario's sake. Elba is crying. Is he going to die? No, my love, he won't die. Is he angry with me? No, I don't think so. What's wrong with Mario? Let's see... we all have a gland over the kidney that produces masculine hormones. Mario produces many of those, which make him look like a boy, although he is genetically a gir... Saint Mary... no, Hail Mary, Full of Grace... Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit... of thy womb, Jesus. We're going to the bar. You stay. Go to the barn. Teeth fine. The feet? Nice animal, Yayo. -Is this enough? -Fine. -Deal? -Deal. Later! 'Morning, Elba. Mario is gone. I've been lookin', but can't find him anywhere. Mario! Mario! Mario! Forgive me, Mario. Come back. What are you doing awake so early? I can't sleep. You'll see, he's going to show up today. You want breakfast? So, here we are enjoying this beautiful song... from the Gauchos del Volga, -For Palomo? -50. -Name? -Victor. Victor. 50. -For Crazy Widow? -50. -50! Name? -Jorge. This is a day to enjoy, we want to remind everyone... that coming soon is the rodeo of Aldea Stauber. There will be barbecue, bocci tournaments, live music and dancing from sunset on.

Now check out the Streck sisters'table, they made delicious krepels for your mate. -Get off my horse, pendejo! -You get me off if you can! Stop... -I paid for that horse... -I'll buy it again... No problem... Wait! We are awaiting the third race. There has been a change of riders... Now Yayo will be ridden by Marito Schneider... and Claudio Roca will run Taba. 400 australes on Claudio. 500 on Mario! Yayo... 200 Australes! 200 Australes! No more money, guys. Betting is closed. Let's race! C'mon Claudio! This is a one-on-one with a lot of expectations, ya know. Claudio is the winner of the last 4 regional races and the young Mario Schneider is running for the first time... with his promising horse, Yayo. C'mon Yayo! These guys are ready to run! -Come on, Claudio. -Come on Mario! Yayo wins the 3rd race of the afternoon! So, Mario Schneider come to the podium to have your picture taken! And how do you think it affected you-know-who? She hasn't said a word... And I don't want to force her... Show her that you are open to talk about it. I wouldn't know what to tell her... If I were you, I'd send her to a psychologist, who knows what consequences this can have... Georgie, would you like a cookie? They are really good... My name isn't George. -Jorge, your manners. -Jorgelina. Come, my love. Don't let the sun ruin that loveIy skin of yours. What if it rains? -The music was ok. -I didn't like it... -Me neither. -Let's make a party here. -Should we bring anything to eat? -Yeah, whatever you can. We could bring a guitar and sing... Let's invite the boys... Girls, what should we wear? Let me see. You never told me what went on at the farm. Nothing happened. Did something happen with Mario? Did he try anything with you? It's a private matter. Why are you being so mysterious? You know you're gonna tell me all about it later!
