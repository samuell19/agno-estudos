I've had a chance to get far in Iife. I've sent other peopIe to schooIs and universities... Take, for exampIe, my former coIIeagues. They are heads of ministeriaI departments or work for foreign trade co-operative companies. Some of them are presidents of whoIe companies. Whereas I Ieft and never wanted to come back. BrickIayer I worked for the Warsaw BuiIding Enterprise. I worked on the NationaI Bank of PoIand. That's when the District Party Committee sent me to a schooI for Party Youth Organization activists in Turczynek. I couId have said 'no', because an order is one thing and your Iife's another. But I agreed in the end. How did I get invoIved in the Party? My father was an oId Party member, and so was my mother. Under the German occupation we hid weapons in our fIat. PeopIe Iike Janek Krasicki were sworn in our fIat. in the Mokotow district after 1932. - How many spoons? - Three. I was working as a brickIayer, my wife was a warehousewoman. We spent time in the cIub room. We even put on smaII productions. At that time we were doing a sketch by Checkov. I was the husband and my wife was pIaying the wife. And that's how our marriage came about. At the schooI in Turczynek young peopIe were suffused with that theory. They thought they'd make a revoIution onIy if they went to work. But when you tried to put theory into practice you reaIized things were a bit different. It was disappointing that our young peopIe were not as briIIiant as they'd seemed. You had to know how to work them. After Turczynek I was sent to Warsaw. I was made chairman of the Ochota District Board PIenum. At that time you might have thought I was a fanatic. But I beIieved that what I was doing and what I'd Iearned and experienced was the onIy right way forward. I beIieved that I was buiIding something for my generation. Let us celebrate the 1st of May. Let us raise our standards, our national standards. Let there be peace among all nations! Let us celebrate the 1st of May! This year, for the first time, we are celebrating with the Warsaw railway junction employees! You look beautiful. When you go past the podium Iike that the impact wiII be huge. - How are you? - Not bad... Have you got a ... We've aII been waiting for you, and you're Iate. I needed to get my famiIy ready. In the earIy 50s there was a campaign against what was caIIed hooIiganism. Every period has its own jargon. In those days 'hooIigan' was one of those terms. Men with Iong hair were immediateIy cIassed as enemies. That's when the antagonisms between those peopIe and the Party Youth Organization activists started. That was compIeteIy unnecessary. ''With atomic energy new Poland is emerging''. This is motto of the lnstitute of Nuclear Research workers. HopefuIIy it won't rain... It won't. The weather's been booked for today. There was a period when Coca CoIa was your enemy because it was part of the western IifestyIe. But now, they're producing it. There are sIogans everywhere ''Drink Coca CoIa. It's good for you'', etc. My daughter drinks gaIIons of it. She Ioves it. I drank it once, thank you. I'd rather stick to soda water. We welcome the youth of the Wola district and their political, administrative and party Ieaders. What terrified me most in my first jobs was having to visit schooIs and face young peopIe. AIthough I was 22 then and I'd been around for a bit, I was scared of discussing history. There had been no schooI during the occupation. Try taIking to me about those subjects... I'm a Iaughing stock. Even when someone made a wrong decision, even sIightIy wrong, they'd get someone to back them up so that they wouIn't Iose authority. For exampIe, when a manager dismissed a worker for misconduct or generating Iosses, etc., and the organization wouId veto it onIy because the person was in the youth organization. That was compIeteIy wrong and we're stiII deaIing with the consequences. I was promoted to vice-president of the OrganizationaI Department of the Party Youth Organization Board, and after four months, to personneI manager of the Warsaw board. You had to dismiss peopIe or penaIize them. That's when, whether you wanted it or not, you had to bring up famiIy issues such as that someone had famiIy abroad or reIatives who were enemies of the cause. And that's what you had to say to them. And that's when you became Iess of an activist and more of an officiaI. It was mereIy a desk job. There was no air, you couIdn't get enough of the windows open. You are requested to take the TO THE PEOPLE FROM THE PEOPLE board to Swietokrzyska Street. The Warsaw workers lead the construction of socialism. Their factories will contribute 30 billion to the bank of Poland. Straighten rows, please. Spread columns. Wider spaces between rows, please. lt's too dense in there. Widen distances between rows... Now slowly spread the columns... We'II see how it turns out... CouId do with a coId drink afterwards. It's high time they made a move on. In 1956, everything suddenIy tumbIed down. It hurt you a bit. You thought, what next? In 1956, I asked permission to move to production work. So, I went back to where I'd come from. Why can't peopIe see that someone's doing a bad job, I don't know. Is this some sort of a method... or is it simpIy short-sightedness. OnIy when a growth becomes maIignant do they remove it. There's no preventive action. Best wishes to our brave... beautiful... the most beautiful women... our Rosas Luxemburg. We wish you all the best. The song about the Six-year PIan ''We wiII buiId new PoIand'', ''Our beIoved country'', ''The song of the tractor drivers'', ''Tram nr 18''... I've forgotten a few titIes. We sing them sometimes, on Sundays when we're stiII in bed, or in the evenings. My daughter took my song-book. There used to be a Youth Organization edition. She took it, she's copying it at the moment. Let her remember it, Iisten and read about it, as Iong as she doesn't have to go through it herseIf. That's my wife's goaI. There is no end to the flood of flowers. There's a sea of flowers in front of the tribune. Our brilliant Warsaw youth and banners WE ARE MULTlPLYlNG THE CROP OF OUR FATHERS' WORK, and THERE lS POWER lN UNlTY... If you've ever tried Iaying bricks you must have come to Iike it. Because it's Iike pIaying with buiIding bIocks. You put one on top of another and something emerges. In the summer, the smeII of Iime and fresh air... It's Iike weight off your souIders. You waIk around and you recognize the pIaces you've worked in. You remember how you used to stand on a site, and how it aII started. It's tangibIe. You can't faiI to see it when you waIk past. You can come and touch it. There's your waII... That's the bit you did. It feeIs feeI good to know that you didn't waste your Iife. Long live the heroic working class of Warsaw!
