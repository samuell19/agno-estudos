I'm reporting to ethics. - Billy, - What do I expect the most? Oh, this is a great question. I admit, I waited. - "What do I expect the most?" - I do not know. Tell me you're an orphan. They always do it. Honestly, maybe the best I look forward to Campus life. I'm an orphan and I believe to the most unexpected places, we can find friends and your family. He will miss him so much this girl. Going to Celtic very good university. Just far away California. But I don't want it now let's talk about that. Because then I'll be sad. Do you like vegan food? - No. - I love animals. Oh, no tofu chicken. Oh no. Real chicken we have to eat. - This is now... - Nothing wrong. Come up. I'll show you your room. They were a little happy my house I know but... Entertaining. Beware, the stairs are bad. Pedro, "our Amora". - Ola. - Thank you. Do not take it personally, everyone like that. Freddy. Billy Batson came. I would like to, if you feel at home. - All right? - Good. - So, don't be foolish. - You know m weird, that is the Romans with their pee they drank their teeth. - HE, - But it's supposed to be healthy. Well, mmm. We are high on Baromi. Believe me, I say from experience. Viktor threw it away. They look nice, but don't take it. Clean Thrones what's going on here. What? Relax, I just took it. Unfortunately, I'm a cancer and I have three months left. I'm kidding again. You look at me and it do you think what's wrong with just one... disabled or disabled but pumpkin is good, huh? Yeah, that's the good old man "Bata rattles". Of course not the original, but. Barom sharp. That's how I could kill you in your dream. Or can you better "Supert"? Yeah, me too. And this is the Holy Grail. This is the 9 mm ball that was fired at Superman. Original. I don't even know how much can. Five-Six Hundreds. Maybe more. - What's in the backpack? - Hey! All right, I understand. No everything belongs to me. It doesn't bother if you are not dumpling. But you're gonna be fine here feel yourself, cool place. Dinner. I'll see your hands. Today, more. I am grateful for my family. I'm grateful for today. I'm grateful for the food even if it is not a tenderloin fillet. About two thousand are here. You think how much alien you are. But rather, hold on to how many new friends you could get. And then I will have new friends. The manager grew up for Cherry call. Nice. Following. This is the security scanner, like at the airport. - You don't have to be afraid of it. - I know what this is. Always such a chick? Ahem. I don't feel silent well myself. But it would be so good, a little silence. - Enjoy the new school, brother. - Listen, you don't have to hug me all the time. We're not a real bro. So... I'm sorry. - We're going? - Let's go. But, I didn't want to hurt you. Frankly, very much shocked. WIZARD She said she was clean I have to be hearty. And that is O wizard or what. Evil. It really looked like Harry in the Harry Potter. So, he says others have experienced this? It's like that. You remember exactly what he said? He's trying it out. I saw a lot of sculptures. They looked at me and pretended would have guided my thoughts. It was a terrible feeling. Do you confirm that you saw these? Yes. That's exactly what it was in my head. But I don't understand where you know... Such and similar ideas they are typical of mass hysteria. - Mass hysteria. - I know. Slightly dramatic expression. Examples include UFO sightings. Sky Lights. Flying saucers. Sometimes people are who didn't know each other… The symbols. Ask about the symbols. Sorry, Miss Kvan, let's say a few words now about symbols. Maybe, you've seen this symbols before, abducted? No, I don't remember symbols, no. I think I recorded it on video. There was something there. I remember the numbers on the alarm clock, changed. He picked it up? I want to see the video. Uh. Miss. I will introduce you Dr. Sivanat. A moment. I'm already sending you. Who is? My goodness. Who is there? Hallo! What's going on? What's all this? I call the police. Suddenly glare around. And so on I felt that they were pulled somewhere. And there was a church there. At a glance, it was just... Dr. Sivana. I appreciate the zeal of the case. But you are just your financier, and has no right to speak into the tests. Fifty-six so far it was kidnapping. - I didn't expect that. - But what? Doctor, what's this all about? For so many years. I was sure make the series wrong. Or. They are not the door the symbols open. But on that woman's watch. That seven symbols. The series. Total seven times repeated. - That's the difference. - It's a joke, isn't it? Maybe it looks like now. Because we are really looking at it has nothing to do with mass hysteria. These people all without exception they all saw real things. I think it was just an hour, and you conclude from this do I have wizards? Come on, it's ridiculous. You can't think seriously, is that real? Sure. It's realistic. I've been waiting for so long. For that minute. And now he finally came. You don't remember me, right? I remember you. You were a kid. How dare you penetrate to my realm? You know what it feels like to a child if they say he will never be good enough? You do not know. What you said many years ago to him he was shocked at who I was. And you know what. I'm not pure heart. The wizard is too weak to stop us. No! Noooo. You didn't find your champion. But we found the one. You're the real champion. Beat. They only use that get out of here. Through you poison everything. That's just what they get. They are turning against each other the people. You are looking for a strong soul old but no one is good for you. Flight or invisibility? If you had a super fort, you would fly or would you be invisible? Anyway, everyone he wants to fly. You know why? For example can you fly away? No no. Heroes are all flying and everyone wants to be a hero. But the invisibility is because so the little shit, because you lurk around people, who don't even know you are there. So this is more satiric like, isn't it? They made a survey and everyone was asking the same question. What a super force you want. Just now without name went all over. And since most of them knew that secret, the invisibility was written. I think people are their souls deep, they don't feel like a hero. I know you want to escape. Dude stole my Superman bullet. Good, I understand, I understand. I was already sucked enough. I didn't trust anyone. That's why gas is invisible. You're completely alone. I didn't steal it the lame bullet. How was it the first day? So good, hah? Jesus, Freddy! - All right? Are you okay? - Yes. Damn you're not normal. - That's good for you. - Are you paying the damage, Freeman? Because you hit me? Yeah, of course we're good? Kent, stop it! Don't hurt my brother. Wow. The kamu family you have to protect it? Are you so soft, Freeman? Come on, what's going to happen. Show me what you can! Now you go home and do you cry the moms? Oh, sorry for you there is no mamid. It hurts her. Hey, Oh, sorry I'm not afraid. It wasn't fair. But you were not them, so. Elf assholes because well I'll break you down. Ah. Hey! This is stepping down. Where are you running? Freddy, are you okay? Hey! Avoid this. Follow us there. This is it. You're not escaping! Run, run! Get it! Come on. Watch out. There is. Fast. You end root. You think you're funny. We can also find you in school. The next stop is a thirtieth street. Switching to Line G and C. Hey! I don't understand what. Help! But rough. Hey! What the hell? Who does this. Good afternoon! Uh. I should have gone off from the subway, but now... Billy Batson. How do you know my name? I'm the wizard last member of the council. Forever reality guard of his rock. Sheep. Yes. Fell down. The situation is that I have no money. Don't get mad here me, son. Where you are now is all spell of magic. This is the rock of eternal reality. The Seven Wizards, Seven Throne. We chose to get used to it long ago a champion. But we decided irresponsibly. He used his power to revenge. And the week was out main sin in your world. More, millions have died. Full civilizations disappeared from the ground. Therefore, I promised that I will not hand over my power until then. Until I find someone who is worthy. Who's strong and pure heart. Well, good. It may be smooth this is magic. I have no idea. But that's for sure not looking for me. Because I'm not a good man. I don't know if it is good man at all. Just, I can count on you. Billy Batson, not just me the whole world. Put your hand on my bot. Blow! Tell me my name I can get through my power. I'll open it to you my heart, Billy Batson. Because you are worthy of it. You are chosen! The champion! Dirt. I really like it to be, but now I have to go. My brothers and sisters have been executed. Their throne, here are empty. I have to give up my power. Come on! Tell me my name. How would I know your name, sir? Do not know him. My name is: Shazam! - This is serious? - Say it! Just tell me, okay? Shazam! Yes. I give you the power. And with it all my strength. Solomon's wisdom. The power of Hercules. Atlas toughness. The power of Zeus. The courage of Achilles. And Mercury's speed. What happened to me? What did he do to me? What did I do with myself? Now you can do much more, like you ever thought. Open your heart and you feel your true power. Act for our brothers and our sisters. How do I get out of here? Cool! Tesoka! Well this is editor is nothing. Gold Boot, Gold Belt, white cape. Disco light, all as it should. Congratulations. Billy! Yes! Lieutenant, I know he had previously escaped and... Twenty-three times? On the net at all there is nothing about it. Not up, like it wouldn't exist. Really, welcome I'll find Billy. I'm serious. But not. You have to wash it it is more important. How do you go after Freddy, run. Hahaha. Beef funny. I thought that... Don't scream... - Viktor! Viktor! - I'm Billy. Billy asked you flight or invisibility. I said stupid, and here you go. I look like this. So you have to help. What's up? Everything is alright? Yes. Yeah, just a little I'm sad that Billy has gone and may be because of me. Maybe I'm the reason. - I think I'm snoring. - No, no, no. He's not gone because of you, son. We'll find it, okay. Your snoring isn't bad. But you're stinking. Snow, snow, snow. Thank God. Stop! Don't come closer. How do I know not you are a super evil. Who climbed into my mind. And you believe me you're Billy. - We? - I called for a quick call! - I call the police! - No! Take it easy.

Listen, I know it's really we are not big span, but you are the only one who knows something about the clichés of justice. - That's Batman. - We? Forget it. Whatever. - Free? - Yeah, of course. Jesus. Crazy what? And what kind of super fort? Super power? For the time being I can't knock on that. Good. Say Can you fly? So, let's press. - How should we do it? - Well, just hit Superman. You must first jump. On! And what should I know? Pay attention. Then you have to believe that you can fly. I read a serious article. The super power. And five out of ten it worked because they believed they can do it. I know. I know. I know. I can fly. I believe that I can fly. Somehow. You believed? Yes. And the invisibility? But that? Whatever. Good. He will go. He will go. Oh my God! We did it! Where did you go? I'm here. Don't you really see? Where? No! Gone! I'm here. Now here! Invisible. Hey! A good editor root.

I do not care. I do whatever I want. And I think at least I'm twenty-five. In fact, maybe thirty. Selected! You're the perfect man. Pure-hearted. Absolutely flawless. - What did you deserve? - Can I apologize? But what do you want? Ah. Give me an autograph? Give your strength. Or you die. Bakker. You're a bad boy. True? I understand.

That Freddy is one Super cool with super hero? - Take care of yourself. - Oh, really? To be a super hero Are you talking to Freedy?
