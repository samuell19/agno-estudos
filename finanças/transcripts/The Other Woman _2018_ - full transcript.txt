GRASSET & FASQUELLE PUBLISHING HOUSE Daniel! Daniel! - Patrick! How are you? - Good. - What are you doing here? - Shopping. Ah, you... I'm so glad to see you! How are you? - Good. And you? - I have to tell you. Do you have time for a coffee? We haven't seen each other for weeks. I'm in a hurry, but if you want to have dinner together one evening. With pleasure. So, finally, I'll introduce you to Emma. - Emma? Ah, you mean your... - Yup. Maybe Isabelle won't be happy to meet her. - She and Laurence are friends. - No, she will be very happy! What are you doing on Saturday? Are you saying he's coming to dinner with his new girlfriend? - And this? - No... Is that so? He left my best friend without scruples, that asshole! It doesn't matter, we'll find another date. Saturday is too early. And you're always too busy. No, Saturday is fine. We will find another date. Don't worry, I'll call you. - Saturday is perfect for us. - Very well! Then I'll call you next week or in ten days. So we decide one day. Before the summer, promised. No, Daniel, we're free this weekend. Are you sure? Otherwise we can do it again. No, we had a commitment, but it jumped. All right then, come to our house. Isabelle will be happy. Glad to meet you... - To meet Emma. - Yup. - Honey, I'm back. - Already? Didn't you go on a diet? I'm careful, I try. But tonight I want a glass, and you? No thanks, I have to finish correcting these tasks. - Here, I... - Thing? No, nothing, I think out loud. Very good this whiskey, really... One of my authors gave it to me for the release of his book. I don't disturb you, do you, honey? Not at all, I'm working, but don't bother me. Better this way. Is... How to say? IS... What are the tasks on? - On the Crimean war. - However! Serious stuff. I have to return them tomorrow morning. If you are hungry, there is what you want in the fridge. Okay thanks. Did you want to tell me something? No, no. By the way, I first met Patrick. Don't you drink anything? Safety? Because it's really delicious. And then? Nothing special, he wants to organize a dinner one of these days. I see. I do not insist, but it is a real malt based delight. A dinner were you saying? - Talk about a dinner. - Yup. And where would it be? I do not know. Here? Why not? Let's see. Wait up. Are you telling me he'll come over for dinner here with his new girlfriend? Well, that is... What did you say to him? - About what? - Dinner. What did I say to him? In your opinion, Isabelle? Tell me. - Here, I told him... - Yup? I told him he didn't talk about it. - Did you really say that? - Sure. I would never suggest he come to dinner with us next Saturday. And with that girl, then! I wouldn't put you in a situation like this. Of course, it doesn't bother you. I say you don't mind inviting that girl to us, right? - Daniel, I'm talking! - Of course it bothers me! I'm still shocked by his separation. For me they were inseparable. He made the biggest crap of his life. But shouldn't I see him again because he left his wife? No, but don't force me to meet that girl here. You are right. If you want to see Patrick, go alone for dinner. Just don't be here. Very well. - Did you understand? - If there's one who understands, it's me. Better this way. I finish correcting homework, okay? Perfect, I let you work in peace. See you later honey. - How are you, old boy? - Well and you? I? - I'm overjoyed! - I'm really pleased. - Sit down. - Sure. - Welcome, gentlemen. - Not bad here. Here's the menu. - Can I get you a drink? - What are you taking? What you take. Two glasses of champagne, then. Let's toast to love! I'm sorry for dinner. I got confused with the dates. Saturday we were not at home. We were abroad, you know. I thought that to set another date, it was better to see us two alone. Perfect. You have so many things to tell me. Then? As I told you, I was reborn! You say it like you've been unhappy all these years. I was, and I didn't realize it. But if I think about it... Look, life with Laurence was so serious, solemn, boring. I wonder how I managed not to blow it up first. We have only one life. You have to live it thoroughly, don't you think? Sure. I want to laugh, travel... fuck. I see so many people who do not live and sincerely feel sorry, I really say. - Not you? - Yes, yes. Sure sure. And you? Tell me. Are you all right with Isabelle? It's normal, my friend, after twenty years... Have you ever thought you were still a handsome man? And I'm not the only one who thinks so. Do you want a friend's advice? You should take advantage of it before... Daniel. Daniel. What's up? I don't know, I was thinking. Maybe I reacted a little too instinctively, you know? About what? At dinner. Yup? After all it is not our business, they are theirs. - We're not children anymore, right? - Yup... We can't not see Patrick because he fell in love with another woman. - Yup. - We organize dinner here, if you want. Listen, you decide. I prefer this rather than... I think it's better. You're a genius, Daniel! The king of negotiations. - By chance you saw my ring... - No. Did you change again? - Yes. This is better, don't you think? - Honey, relax. It's just a dinner with Patrick, not a gala dinner. Does this jacket look good on me? It's not too much... No, you look great. You're right, I'm not sick, indeed it rejuvenates me. - Risks of tarnishing Patrick. - You say? - I'm counting on you to go well. - Sure. Let's not think about Laurence for a couple of hours. - Understood? - Yup. - Patrick! - Daniel! - How are you? - Good. Come in. - Thanks. - You're alone? Emma is coming. Finishing a phone call, salt in two minutes. - Isabelle! How are you? - And you? I leave the door open, then? Yes, the cell phone started ringing while we were taking the elevator. It was important. I went up to keep you waiting, now she comes too. I am happy to see you again and introduce you to Emma. Us too, right? I realize that the situation is a little delicate. I want to thank you for this dinner. Really. It's normal, you would have done the same thing in our place. And that is? - Give me your jacket. - Yes thanks! Here, I brought you a bottle. - How kind! Thing... - Thanks. Patrick! A Ch√¢teau... - It's just a bottle. - It's too much, you didn't have to. It's perfect, there's the lamb tonight. Would you like a drop of champagne in the meantime? If you could avoid asking her how we met... Meaning? I know it would make you uncomfortable. It's just a precaution. No problem. But why would it make her uncomfortable? In short, how did you meet? How did you meet? Here she is. Come in, my love, it's here. Good evening. Come, I'll introduce you. Here, I present to you Emma. Emma, it's Isabelle. - Good evening. - Pleasure. And Daniel. Pleasure. I'm sorry I'm late, but I absolutely had to answer. Do not worry. Come. - Yes, please. - Come. - Come. - Yup. - Can I help you? - Yes, with pleasure. Thanks. Preferences... In short, you want... What? Preferences... - Want... - Yup? Something to drink? - With pleasure! - Champagne, to begin with? - Perfect! - Well, I'll take the bottle in the fridge. No, I'll go. - I'll go, honey. - I'll go, I'll be right back. You think of our friends. I don't want to be alone with them! Come back now, she went to get the champagne. - You are welcome. - Come on, sit down. Thanks. Sit here. It never stops! - How do you say? - I used to say that he doesn't talk about her. For good, I want to hope! Naturally! You look surprised, but you are one of my oldest friends. Old time, you mean, because I am not old. - I'm younger than him. - Do you know what? Age, after all, has no importance. I guarantee you that Patrick has good physical endurance. This summer we take a house in Ibiza. A house full of rooms! You can come in July if you like. - How kind! - Yes, I confirm. She's gorgeous. Since Patrick showed me the photos, I don't think of anything else. Stand by the pool in a bathing suit... Oh yes, yes. I'll be right back, I'll go see if Emma... Sorry... If Isabelle needs me for the champagne. What are you doing? Did you see that girl? What dress do you have? It's pathetic, painful! What an injustice! If I think of Laurence, a woman so refined! Isabelle, come over there, waiting for us. I don't understand how he could have left Laurence, who is an extraordinary woman, for a 30-year-old girl. Well, it seems easy to understand. - Sorry, what did you say? What did you say? - Nothing. - Yes, you said that... - Nothing! I said they are waiting for us there. We decided not to think about Laurence for two hours. So please! - I feel like throwing up. - Champagne on the way! Can I give you a hand? No, very kind. Isabelle arrives immediately. Daniel is an excellent cook, no one would get help from anyone. "Excellent"... Let's say I have a sense of cooking. A man who cooks well is sexy. - Really? - Yup! Yes, show that you appreciate good things and loves to give pleasure to others. Am I wrong? Here I am. I'm sorry, I couldn't find him anymore... The champagne! He couldn't find champagne anymore! What's the matter with you? But nothing, honey. Nothing. I open this bottle. Here it is. Here, Patrick. Isabelle is an extraordinary woman, very bright. There is a lot of complicity between us. Yes, a great intellectual complicity. What are you saying? Nothing, honey, I said I was a completely satisfied man. - Here, my love. - Thanks. Well, friends... - To yours! - To yours, honey. To yours, my love! Emma, we're happy to have met you, really! Me too. Cheers! So... Tin tin! - Cin! Cheers! - Yup. - To yours, Isabelle! - Cheers. So how have you... Did I mean, do you live together? Yup. I took an apartment in a hurry. - In short, you know the situation. - Yes, yes. But soon we'll look for something nicer and bigger. We saw an apartment this afternoon. - Really great. - Yup. - With the most beautiful terrace in Paris! - Incredible. It is expensive, but beautiful. Not too expensive, considering what it is. It's sublime! My love, have you seen? It's incredible! Yes, it's beautiful. It's incredible! - You can see all of Paris. - You like? - It's so romantic! - If you like it, we'll take it. Daniel? Daniel? Daniel, are you with us? Yes, sorry. Sure. Patrick hasn't told us anything yet. What do you do in life, Emma? I? - Emma is an actress. - No. No, no, stop it. No, I'm not an actress, but I would like to. Let's say I do auditions and waiting for something to happen, I work in a bar. - In a bar? - Yup. - Good evening. - Good evening. Do you offer me something to drink? What do you want? I do not know. Champagne? What are you doing? - She's a prostitute! - Thing? - Yes, it's a... - But what comes to your mind? That moron left his wife, his life, my best friend graduated in Literature, for that bitch! Now I understand why he didn't want us to ask how they met. And for this! The bar! They met in that bar! All bullshit! He said he's an actress! You see nothing! Not even that I changed clothes! You are all the same. As soon as you see a half naked, don't think any more. Sorry. I just wanted to wash my hands. - This way. - No, leave! I'll take care of it, come with me. I believe it, uncle. I believe with ardor, with passion. We will hear the angels. We will see all the evil of the earth, all our sufferings drowned in mercy that will fill the whole universe. And life will be sweet, tender, good, like a caress. I believe it. I believe it. You have never had joys in life. Wait a little longer. Wait up. We will rest. We will rest! We will rest! Brava! Bravi! Bravi! Brava! Brava! Bravi! Daniel! It came! How kind! It was touching. Yup? Really? She liked it? Yes a lot. - Isabelle not there? - No, unfortunately it could not come. Very sorry, had a last minute engagement. I came alone. Let's go to drink something? With pleasure, but I would not disturb you, will be engaged... No, indeed! If you give me a minute, I'll change and go. Yes Perfect. Perfect. Sorry! I'm sorry, I made you wait. No not at all. I know a very nice place. - Perfect, I follow you. - Here we go? However, Patrick was right when he said that she is very gifted. No, I'm serious, I was very impressed with the show. The text was so engaging and she is so... I love this neighborhood, and you? - Especially at night, do you see how beautiful it is? - Yes it is really nice. - It's the Paris I love. - Me too. And Patrick? There is not? - No. - Are you still together? Come this way. - You are welcome. - Thanks. Gentlemen, would you like? - What are you drinking? - A glass of red wine. Thanks to me too. - We don't see each other anymore. - You and Patrick? I didn't know, I'm sorry. He's a lovely man. But really too... - How to say? - Superficial, surely. He's the kind of person who laughs at his own jokes. To tell the truth, I was surprised the first time I saw you together. - At dinner? - Yup. Because? For the age difference? No, indeed! But she seemed so much more... Is one that... How to say? He is not at all a profound person. He's a friend, I love him, but she's like that, I don't know... Intense. An intensity that almost intimidates. Can I be honest, Emma? I can? I love asparagus. They are easy to cook, but this sauce needs to be done. "It doesn't exist in Spain, does it?" - No. By the way, which part of Spain is it exactly? My parents live in Barcelona. I grew up there, yes. I always hope you come. I would like to introduce my parents to him, but he doesn't want to. But no, what are you saying? I just don't have time. Daniel, my mother! Nice to meet you, lady! And mum? - My grandmother! - Mrs! Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. And the aunt! - Pleasure! Is it your aunt? - Yup. Oh, my cousin! He's Daniel. I love you so much I love you so much My life My soul My star The candies, the poppies, the "my love" Crazy kisses, sparks at dawn My life My heart My youth. Well, I'd love to go there. In Barcelona, I mean, not from his parents. - There never was? - No, yet it's not far away. Indeed, it is very close to Paris, but I don't know her. Some cities are like this, like missed appointments. For me it's Venice. Have you never been to Venice? We must fix it right away! It is such a city... How to say? So poetic. Nice what you say. Does anyone still want champagne? Willingly, thank you. Here, Patrick. - Good. - They're good, right? - Fabulous, Isabelle. - Thanks. Emma, a little... - Thanks. - This sauce is perfect. - And you two? - We? No, them. Patrick didn't tell us anything. About what? How you met. I mean, Isabelle! In that bar, right? Am I wrong? - Oh sorry! - No, no. - I'm alright darling? - Yes, nothing happened. - No, no, no. - I'm so sorry. - Do you want a napkin? - Anything? No problem, no stain. Yes, we are lucky, champagne does not stain. - No. - I'm sorry. Fortunately it is not wine, with champagne... - It also smells good. - No. - I'm really sorry. - It doesn't matter, really. If he knew how many times I spilled the champagne on a customer! - On a client? - Yes, dozens of times. And then, I love champagne. Then let us toast. Cheers! - Cin, friends. - My love. - Cheers. - Isabelle. Sorry, I don't remember what we were talking about anymore. He was telling us how you met. Ah, I was saying... Ah. Really? I think so. We look forward to knowing. I mean, Isabelle! - Thing? - I do not know. Never ask these things, it is a very intimate fact. - You say? - Yes. No. Patrick? Not really, but... How to say? - Thing? - Come on, do we want to know everything? - It must have been in that bar. What bar is it? - You are welcome? - What bar is it? - Of tapas? A winery? I'm sorry honey, Isabelle has always been very curious. No, that's fine by me, you are uncomfortable. We met in a waiting room, if you really want to know. In a waiting room? We had the same gastroenterologist, we had a stomach ache. We both had a little problem. I see him again, still bent over, go to the bathroom every three minutes. - It was just... - Come on, don't... We don't go into details. - Because? - Come on... Why didn't you want to tell us? The waiting room of a gastroenterologist is not a very pleasant place. - No, indeed. - Oh, my love. It's a novel. - What did you have? - I do not know. I've been sick for months. I was afraid it was something serious. I did resonances, x-rays, but they found nothing. Then I met Emma and decided to put my life in order. You mean, deciding to leave Laurence? No, deciding to live the life I wanted to live. Simply. And since then I have recovered, I no longer have any pain. Fantastic. Yes, it's like a novel. - I'm going to get the appetizers. - Treasure. - I help you? - No, I'll do it. - I'll help you. - All very good, really. Thanks. Go help, honey. Now that I think about it, I too sometimes have stomach pains. Should I get checked, maybe? Eventually, can you give me your doctor's address? - Good morning, ma'am. - Good morning. I have an urgent appointment with Dr. Baudoin at 4pm. You are Mr.... I called this morning on behalf of Patrick Colucci. Yes sure. Take a seat in the waiting room. - The doctor will call you shortly. - Thanks. Who's next? I believe in me. He undresses, the doctor arrives in a moment. Undress? It means... Yes sure. Don't be so shy, we don't eat it. Though... Then... What's up? - Are you okay, Daniel? - Yes, sorry. It's just that... maybe the lamb is a bit overcooked? It's perfect. Safe for sure? - Absolutely, it's delicious. - Do you want another slice? - No thanks. - Safety? - Yup. - Patrick? No, thanks, I'm trying to give myself a set in this period. I eat less, I drink less. - Do sport again. - I go by bike every morning. Really? - Can not see it? - Yup. It changes your life, you know. I still have two kilos to lose before the summer. The costume test does not forgive. By the way, for Ibiza, Isabelle. I told Daniel that we rent a house this summer. If you want to come a few days, we would really like it. - You're kind. - Seriously, try to come. Believe me if I tell you it's a beautiful house, not a lie. - It is the most beautiful house in Ibiza! - Yup. We will have to see the dates, but I thank you anyway for the invitation. Would you like, you know? We could ride a bike. Just between us, it wouldn't hurt you. Feel a little... what would that mean? But no! It was to laugh! Tell me on my lips I will understand it with my heart Your cries disturb me, dream Dream Tell me gently Simply murmur it I will listen to you much better Of course Tell me on my lips I will understand it with my heart And I can continue my dream My dream. - Then? - Thing? - What are you doing? - I can't keep up with you. Isn't that a heart attack? Up! - Here I am. - Hurry up. The girls prepared lobster. - And Emma the aperitif. - Yup? It goes crazy. Don't you want to ride? No, it is just a dizziness due to the sun. Nothing serious. I'm more resistant than usual, I don't know what happens to me. - Do you want another lobster? - No thanks, dear. - When we do the steps... - Nobody? Sure? I wanted to say that when I do the steps with Patrick I always arrive before him. But today I don't know what happened to me. - Really? - I really say, always. I'm usually much more resistant, right, dear? How good you are here! It is a paradise. Yup! I'm going to take a bath, don't you mind? No. - It's great here. - I told you! Oh yeah. It's strange, his eyebrows are not the same color as his hair. Yes, the eyebrows are slightly darker. I wonder what color has... On the nose, I'd say blonde. Venetian blond. You are welcome? - What did you say? - I? Nothing. Who is Venetian blond? No, sorry, I was thinking of... - At what? - Nothing. I was thinking of a friend of mine from Venice. Roberto. Roberto, a Venetian. I was thinking of the metro station where we should meet tomorrow. Les Sablons, the Venetian sands. Sorry, I have a lot of thoughts in my mind. I got it from my mother. I leave you, I go to get dessert. Sorry, I'll be right back. - What's wrong? - I do not know. I'm sorry. I have no idea. What's the matter with you? Take it easy! Breathe. Why did I make cream puffs? - I had to do something simpler. - Where do I put these? - Such as? - Where do I put them? Put them there in... - In the sink. - Yes good. - Here. - Thanks. I'll arrive right away. What a beautiful kitchen, it's great. Thanks. Can I help you? What did you prepare for dessert? Fritters. Cream puffs. - Do you like cream puffs? - Yup. I'm too greedy, cream puffs make me crazy. - Are you greedy? - Terribly. Well, then warm up the... The chocolate will be ready in three minutes. - Does it put chocolate on it? - Of course ! Are these dessert plates? Do I take them there? No, leave it, I will serve the cream puffs directly in... - How do you say? In the dishes. - So I'll leave them here? - Yes, if you want. - Yup. I put the... I put on my apron, for chocolate. I like doing everything perfectly. What's up? - Nothing. - Tell me, why are you laughing? She makes me laugh. And why? He knows very well why. Well, now the chocolate. Yup. Slowly. - Thing? - I mean, slow fire. Fire. Slow fire. Let them smell good. Here, start... melt. I mean, chocolate. The chocolate begins to... melt. I'm sorry. No, what am I doing? - I haven't thought of anything else since before. - Me too! It's terrible. The two of them are in the next room. I know. - What are we doing? - How "what do we do"? Do you want to go back there? It is a bit difficult to do otherwise. Where is this door going? It's horrible, horrible, horrible! Taxi! Oh, good heavens! Do you realize what we're doing? - No. - It's monstrous. They are still waiting at the table! - Don't think about them. - Well, it's hard. Where are you taking me? Take me somewhere. We have only one life. Driver, in Orly. Seems ready, no? How do you say? I say it looks like it's ready, right? Yes, right. And then what does he do? Does it put it directly on top? Yes, but I don't know if it's liquid enough. - Let me taste it. - What? The chocolate. I did it when I was little. Yes, if you want. Careful, it's very hot. Open your mouth. Then? It's chocolate... what? Didn't get it? Aspects, aspects. Give me some more and I'll tell you. As you want. Then open your mouth. What are you waiting for? Now close your eyes. What do I do with the bottle? - The dress! - Shit! - What is that? - It's chocolate! - What is happening? - The pot got out of hand. Do not worry sweetheart, we'll find a solution. - I have my dress completely ruined! - Burn? - Need hot water... - No, no. - Don't rub! - My dress is ruined! - No, it wouldn't help. - I'm really sorry, I... If you use the dishcloth, the stains remain. He must take it off immediately, come with me. - Damn! - I'm really sorry. Let's go back now. Oh, man, Patrick! Patrick, it's terrible! - But no! - Yes, I'm mortified! Come on, don't take it that way, it's just a dress! He will hate me. It's not the type. He doesn't care about clothes! She is interested in people, the meetings, the life. - He loves life so much. - Sure! She is a greedy. - You are welcome? - I mean, you're right. We see that he loves... - The life. - Who loves life. She is alive, very alive. That's what I meant, do you understand? You can't imagine how much. Oh yes? Exactly, I imagine to perfection. I had not seen her. - A good news? - Yup! I just talked to my agent. They took me for a theater show. - Fantastic. - Yup! He is a director that I love. We bring Chekhov's Uncle Vanya . I'm so happy. - "I love it!" - Such as? "She is my happiness, my life, my youth. I don't ask her anything. I know that the hope of being loved in return is nothing. Let me just listen to it, to look at it. " It's a quote. The show! The text of Uncle Vanya. - Excuse me, I thought... - No, no. - I thought... - Oh yes. Fantastic! We are very happy for you. He told us about this project when we met. Yes, and I thought I had it all wrong. - Crazy! - Do you want another glass? - No thanks. - I hope you come to see me, - in September. - Naturally! Of course, we love going to the theater. Then I will send you the invitations. If we let it stay for a while your Uncle Vanya ? If we went dancing? You love dancing. - Patrick. - What I've said? We are all going to dance. - Yup. - Patrick... What did I say, my angel? I'm sorry, I'm a little tired. Are you tired? Stop that! Come on, let's go dancing. I told you I didn't like it. All right. So I learn to go out with a woman older than me! What's up? What I've said? Treasure... Sorry. Come on, baby! Isn't it possible, what's the matter with you? No, d√©jame never! This never! Muy cansada what? - In my opinion, their story will not last long. - Because? I don't know, intuition. Did you see how he looked at it? He doesn't love it. - You believe? - Of course, he doesn't love it! - I'm going to bed. Aren't you tired? - No. Do you mind if I turn off? I can't stand up from sleep. I'm going to walk a little. - Now? - Yes, I want to walk. - You're sorry? - No. Good night. - What are you doing here? - I look at the sky, it's so beautiful! Yes, it's beautiful, yes. - Did you see that star up there? - Yup. How are you with Emma? You know, there's passion between us, is its Russian character. I thought it was Spanish. Of nationality, yes, but of character is Russian. - She likes you very much. - Oh yes? Can I ask you a question? Why did you decide to part with Laurence? Last summer you seemed very close. - We've always been, you know. - So? It is hard to explain. I imagine that there were small character incompatibilities between us. Character incompatibilities? After twenty years? Yes, little things that become important over time. For example? For example, she's allergic to the sun, did you know? It will seem ridiculous, but we have been vacationing in Brittany for years. While I love the sun. - I need it to feel good, you understand? - Yup. - And you? Isabelle all right with Isabelle? - Yes good. - Sure? - Yup. Better like this then. What do you think they're doing? I do not know. Let it soak. It's the best thing to do with chocolate. Patrick gave me this suit. - It's beautiful, it's good for you. - It cost a fortune. I would be surprised if he cleaned himself. All in all, it does nothing. I didn't like the color. Everything good? Yes good. Sorry. I'll lend you my dress to finish the dinner. I would also stay naked, I'm not so demure. But I guess Patrick wouldn't feel comfortable. Try it if you like it. Everything goes for me, don't worry. It's a stripper! What are you saying? She just took off her dress to clean it! You don't understand, you don't understand anything! - What I do not understand? - Can't you see what a girl she is? He is interested in a man only if he can afford a super villa in Ibiza! It will reduce it to green and then it will go away. - You say? - Of course, everything is already written! And then he, what self-satisfaction! Bring a bottle and just happen to be your favorite wine. He sees an apartment and is the most beautiful in Paris. Rent a house, must be the most beautiful in Ibiza! But what do you want from us? What has the most beautiful woman in the world? - Is that so? - But how much crap you say! And how he looks at you, with those smiles of satisfaction... Enjoys seeing what you do. - Because? What do I do? - Look at the windows. - Thing? - Look at the windows. Do I look at the windows? You're delirious! He came here to introduce us to the woman I love. The woman he loves! What does it have to do with looking at the windows? - Forget it. - Where are you going? I'm going to see if my dress looks good on Emma. Or maybe you prefer to eat the sweet dessert? What nerves! How nervous I am! Fasten your belt. Do you realize what you make me do? A few hours ago I didn't even know you. You know, all this scares me too. - But I know one thing. - I mean? It could not be otherwise. In her was the promise of a crazy life, perhaps irresponsible, perhaps vain, but dense and swirling. For the first time in his life... he felt alive. He had slept for years, in the bed of conventions and habit. But he had finally awakened. Very good this whiskey. - Very good. - One of my authors gave it to me. Do you want another glass? You are an angel, but I get up early tomorrow. Tell me something. Are you OK? - You seem absent. - I? It is from before you have your head elsewhere. I have the impression that you think of something else. No, not at all. - Do you have something for me? - Really! What are you going to think about? Yes, it is. I call a taxi. I have a subscription. Two clicks and it arrives. - Ah, perfect! - Yup. You see? A black Mercedes in three minutes. You should also install this app yourself, it's comfortable. - I'll show you some pictures. - What a photo? Of the house we rented for this summer. Look, you'll like it. - Here's the house. - Yup. Here is the terrace, there the sea. Not bad, right? - It will cost dear. - Leave it. - How much? - Ten thousand. - Per month? - No, per week. Oh yes? Why are you smiling? - I? - Smile with satisfaction. What are you saying? No, I was just saying that if you want... In July you are welcome. Yes, you told me at least three times. Cucciola, I just called a car. I was just telling Isabelle that we get up early tomorrow morning. Yup. Well, anyway, it was wonderful. - We'll do it again soon. Thanks, old man. - Yup. Emma, don't forget the dress! Thanks. Are you bringing her tomorrow? Whenever you want, there's no hurry. Here it is. You don't know, but Patrick has a very comfortable application. Press a button and the taxi will arrive in three minutes. Unbelievable, isn't it? Patrick always has incredible applications. - He has things that others don't have. - Why do you say that? Why do I say what? It's the truth! It is not a reproach, it is a statement. You always have the best. There! If you really want to know, I remain speechless. And then it makes me drool. I drool! You see? Drool! Drool! Drool! Daniel, what's wrong with you? Why do you get nervous? Maybe we drank too much. If you want, I'll install the app. - Nothing could be easier. - No. No thanks, I prefer the metro. Yes, I know, at the Sablons station, with Roberto, your Venetian. - Well... - Here are the overcoats. Come on, let's talk. Nothing happened. - Agree. - Here. - Thanks. - My jacket. Thanks. Thanks for everything. And again congratulations for the cream puffs, they were delicious. - Thanks so much. - See you soon. I forgot. Green hazelnut. Excuse me? The chocolate. It was green hazelnut. - Then good night. - Yes, Emma? - Yup. - Emma, come on, honey. - Good evening. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night. How are you? Are you tired? Let's fix tomorrow, I only bring the glasses in the kitchen. Yes, as you wish. Everything good? Why did you get upset with Patrick for that taxi story? I don't know, it bothered me tonight. I feel guilty. Isn't that what I told you about smiles? No, of course not. And how did she feel? - Who? - Emma. And to you? I liked it. At first I was a little negative, but then I was pleasantly surprised. I don't know, it has charm, it's fine. Ah, you... No. - Yes, seriously, he has something. - You say? No, I found it decidedly vulgar. I was embarrassed. When I think Patrick dropped everything for her, I honestly don't understand. And even physically, it's trivial. And he struts around without thinking that it's just pathetic. - Patrick? - After all, he just wants to see me drool. - What are you saying? - I say it's pathological. He needs to be envied. I'm sorry, but it doesn't work with me. You know it, it's always been like this. The saddest thing is that it spoils life. Destroys relationships with his wife, with children and also with friends. It's like seeing for the first time what it really is. - Indeed? - Yes, it's very sad to say. I have the impression that we will never see each other again the impression that we have arrived at the end of our friendship. We'll see. I bring the glasses back to the kitchen. I'm a genius. I'm sorry, it was awful. Why do you say that? Not for you? A deadly bore. It's my fault. What an absurd idea this dinner is, it couldn't work. They can't stand seeing us together, both. They undermine their bourgeois balance too much. How could I endure all this for years? I liked him. - Daniel? - Yup. Yes, I also found it... seductive. - I'd like a cigarette. Do you have any? - Are you serious? I don't know why, it's for whiskey. I want to smoke a cigarette to finish the glass. - Do you remember how it turns on? - Well, of course. Are not you tired? Aren't we going to bed? I just lit a cigarette. - I'll wait if you want. - You're kind, but there's no need. Go to bed. Well, I'll be right back. In any case... I promise you, I will never again inflict these evenings on you. What's up? Don't forget to return the habit. How do you buy crap like that? What do you have? Nothing. Emma, what did I say? Leave me alone. Why do you behave like this? Emma, I'm talking to you. Open the door. What's the matter with you? What's wrong? Tell me, honey, what's wrong? I think I fell in love. Thing? And whose? In your opinion? No, are you kidding? I'm sorry, Patrick. Isabelle? Emma? What are you doing here? - Disorder? - No, it's just that I was... working. I brought back Isabelle's dress. - I was passing through these parts. "It's kind, but it's not there now." Do you give it to her? Yup. But... How to say... Do you want a drink? A coffee? I don't want to disturb you. I was alone in the area. It doesn't bother me, come on. Come in. Truly a successful dinner. - He says? - Yup. How kind. I'm sorry for how Patrick behaved. - But no. - Sometimes he has such attitudes... In short, he knows it. Do not worry, I love him for that too. Then you will come to Ibiza? I do not know. It looks nice, Patrick showed me some pictures, why? - Can I be honest? - Yup. You better not come at all. Agree. All right. And why? You know very well why. Maybe it's better to go. Already? He didn't even drink coffee. I think it's better this way. Emma? Emma? Excuse me, I... I'm sorry, I meant... It will seem completely out of place, but see... How to say? If you have time, I'd be happy to invite you to have a drink. Yes, I know, it's completely out of place. Yup. I'm sorry. Call me. Thank you very much. - It was a nice evening. - Yup. How do you get home? You want me to call you a taxi or... Do not worry, I walk back, I live nearby. I'll take you? Can I make a confession? Yup. I hated holidays in Ibiza. And why? And since we are on the subject of confessions, I wanted to tell her... I didn't tell my wife that I came to applaud her at the theater tonight. Don't you like Chekhov? I didn't show you the tickets you sent us. I said I had a dinner with an author. - Because? - I didn't want him to accompany me. And why? I think you know very well why. What's up? I live here. - Everything good? - You do not sleep? - No, I was expecting you, it's very late. - Yes, it took longer than expected. - You'll be tired. - I would say yes. I wanted to come back first, but you know how it is with the authors... - Everything good? - Yes, all right, honey. Sleep well. For a long time we didn't take a walk like this, I'm happy. Me too. We used to come here often, do you remember? - I wanted to tell you something. Do you know who I saw? - No. - Laurence. - Oh yes? And do you know what he told me? Patrick was left. Really? I told you it wouldn't last. He came back to her with his tail between his legs, but she refused. After the evil he did to her, he didn't want to see it anymore. I believe he is not well. Maybe you should call him or visit him. It's beautiful, isn't it? - It's a first edition. - I would say yes. - Sir, how much is it? - 450. - Do you take it? - Yes, I want to give you a present. - I'm destroyed. - I guess, my poor friend. You realize? I left everything for her, everything! And from evening to morning, without any explanation... He met another. This is the explanation. - You believe? - I know. - Oh shit. - And I know who he is. - Really? - It's that guy, the director of his show. - Thing? - No, nothing, I thought you... No, no. He turns around from the beginning. An ugly face, see you! A horrible person! Now I've lost everything. All. My son doesn't talk to me. Laurence asked for a divorce. Come on come on. I was an asshole. I fucked up, my God. Brava! Brava! Tonight it wasn't trivial, but... how to say? - I loved it! - Yup. But your realism, when you act, it must not crush reality. Indeed, on the contrary, the real must become realism. Chekhov's real must become the unreal of the viewer. Daniel, are you? Bruno! - Isabelle came with you? - No, it could not come, unfortunately. Salutamela. - Nice, huh? - Yes very nice. - Good again. - Thanks. - She was... very good! - Thanks. Fuck, it's a colleague of my wife. Well, are we going to drink to celebrate? Come with us? Unfortunately I can't tonight. It 'does not matter. - See you tomorrow then. - See you tomorrow. What a loser that. Everything good? What's up? What happens? Nothing. Maybe it's better to stop seeing each other. But why? Why do you say that? You're married, Daniel. What can I expect from this situation? I want more, you understand? You can't give me anything else. See you secretly, for how long? A month? Two? I'm not happy. It's not your fault. I'm the one who's too sentimental. What if we leave for a few days? Thing? Next week, if we all left? - What are you saying? - Kiss Me. Please... Emma, kiss me. Emma? This morning, on waking, I felt terrible. Suddenly, I realized that all this made no sense. We made a huge fool of things, Daniel. Forgive me if I understood it too late. Go to your wife. It's the best thing you can do. Goodbye. I'm sorry. I'm so ashamed. It's right. I don't know what came over me. Can I come in? No, it's too late, I don't want to see you anymore. Isabelle, I need to talk to you! Isabelle! What are you doing here? - I need to talk to you, Isabelle. - But I do not want. You can not do this to me. - I don't deserve it. - Why do I do? Look, I know I'm unforgivable. I behaved in a really stupid way. But I didn't know what I was doing, I lost control. You see? I've lost control of my life. I thought a lot about what happened to us. It was a horrible time. That girl counts for nothing. Isabelle, I feel lost. The only thing that matters is us. Please, I beg you, give me another chance. After what we have lived, you can't leave me like that. You left me, Daniel. Every action has consequences. It's over. You understand it? I'm going to sleep, are you? My love! My love, my love! - What's the matter with you? - No, nothing, I thought. I thought and told myself that I am happy to live with you. Come on come on. And I thought that I care too much for you, that I'm fine with you. And I'd like to take a trip with you. What would you say if we left in the sun? - Don't you want to accept the invitation to Ibiza? - No, of course not. I don't know... In Venice, for example? The two of us, in Venice! - You make me laugh. - I? - Yup. - Because? - You know. - Tell me. - Come to bed. - Tell me why I make you laugh. - Because... - For what? Because you read me in thought. I read you in thought, in fact. If you are so smart, tell me then. After all, it wasn't so difficult.
