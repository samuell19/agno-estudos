We shall procure rations ASAP as to avoid future SNAFU. You're a fucking douchebag, dude. Huh, yeah. I'm just making sure we're stocked. No need to ruin a good trip. Oh, and I just want to pull that stick out of your ass. Hi, uh, n... nice boots. Uh-huh. [laughing] Thanks. Nice blade. Smith & Wesson? Good eye, miss. - Courtney. - Courtney. I, uh, I actually prefer anything Kershaw makes. I feel like, um, S&W oughta just stick to sidearms, ya know? Oh, okay, well, maybe Jeremiah Jones doesn't bring his best steel out in a Podunk town like this. Maybe I'm from this Podunk town and I don't need a tourist telling me what he sees fit to bring in and out. Wow. Well, it just so happens that I'm from a few miles up north. So, that makes me an authority on Podunkery. Podunkery, yeah, you must be from somewhere around here, handsome. Handsome? So you've never left this area? - No, not at all. - No. No, actually, um, I, uh, I was just at school. I just came back. I'm gonna be staying with family until I get all settled. Oh, Jeremiah Jones stands corrected. Does Jeremiah Jones actually refer to himself in the third person all the time? [laughing] No. No. No, but what I... what I do do is tend to, uh get a bit goofy and become an idiot when I meet a pretty girl. [laughs] Actually, um if you wanna see some real foolish idiots you should, uh, come down to the bar. Where I work. On Monday, maybe? It's my first shift back. I could give you a long pour and you could fight off the scumbags. [whispering] - Just go over there. - What? Just go that way. I don't want you to get in trouble. Go. - Klaus. - What? If you ask me, Sasquatch was responsible for them deaths. Just says they're missing. Doesn't say they're dead. You ever hear of someone goin' missin' in the woods, showin' up two months later roastin' marshmallows? Sasquatch got 'em, for sure. [scoffs] Unless you believe in aliens. Well, I do watch all that Discovery Channel History Channel stuff, so at this point I'll pretty much believe any hare-brained explanation, am I right? - Klaus. - What? Sorry, what I mean to say is, uh it's really nice to hear it from a legitimate, first-hand source, hm? You lose something in there? No, I was just checking out the brand. Um... cool bag. Ever hear of karma? No, um it's, but it just looked more like, more expensive from over there. Here. I won't deny the needy. What? What the shit's that supposed to mean? Pardon me. Okay. How ya doin', buddy? You okay? Is he bothering you? Uh, nothin' bothers me, man. I've transcended that way of thinking. Okay. You need a ride somewhere or somethin'? What? No. Why? Yeah. Alright, cool. Come on. That's rude. [eerie music] No, no, now, don't go hermit on me now. No boys allowed, no boys allowed. Now, don't you start boltin' up on me now. Oh, no. You're lookin' good. Look at you. Look at you. Yeah. Oh, you're comin' along Ni.. You got competition. [distant howling] [saw whirring] Oh, for fuck's sake. Peggy, you gotta be on that. It's gotta be runnin' all night by sundown. I ain't takin' any chances I ain't gotta. What's he so worked up about? Baby, while we're young. I was hopin' I wasn't gonna have to tell you. You're only here a couple of days. Oh, okay. Thank you. Thank you. [motor whirring] I don't wanna scare you, hon. I don't think they want you. I really don't. But it's only fair that you know. - I ain't crazy, either. - He ain't. Know what? Remember a couple years ago we told the family that he was locked up for hittin' up that liquor store? Mm-hmm. He wasn't locked up. He didn't rob nothin'. They had him! I'm... I'm sorry. Who had him where? Where? Uh... space. I don't know. Uh... a... a different dimension. I don't... I don't know. Them Grey fuckers. Those... those... those Grey fuckers! You know, and... and Martians or whatever you want to call them but they're not from Earth and they ain't cute like no E.T. Not like no E.T. So.. You see, Court. I ain't sure what they want but they ain't nice. It's like they come through this... this chemical pathway-like type thing. You see, meth, meth, for example it opens up somethin' in the mind. But what does it really open, huh? For some, creativity. And, uh, others, they just wanna just wanna fuck like rabbits. Oh. [giggles] What? Pardon my French. But for them, maybe it's a way in, right? Or maybe they just know better how to access its power. Well, goddamn, I ain't no scientist but I know what I see. Why you, Uncle Brock? [Brock chuckles] I've been workin' on a special isomer of meth for years. Started on accident. I was makin' a batch, already halfway through and it comes time to add the red phosphorus but I was out. It was either throw out the whole batch.. Or improvise. Well, I guess I don't have to tell you what I did. I improvised. [chuckles] Invented this whole new shit. And was startin' to get it perfect. And I think they know. Hell, I think they might've even rejiggered my brain so I could make this shit. You ever, uh.. You heard of emerald ice? No. Well, it's pretty goddamn famous. I mean, they even got it on the Internets. - Internet. - Yep. You should Google it. [distant howling] - I have to pee. - Fine. But it's... I think it's right up here. I... I know it's a little dirt road... Alright, dude, you're full of shit, man because we've passed this same exact road like 10 times now. Well, can't we just wander out into the woods set up a few tents roll a doobie and call it a night? I wanna find these fucking hot springs, man. Babe, can we just get out of this car? I wanna find a hotel. We could take some shots. Maybe just.. It'll be my treat. Hey, I'm... I'm cool with whatever, guys. Guys, I'm cool with, uh, whatever. Whatever the flow dictates, ya know? Wait, yeah. Wa... wa... wa... wait. I Th... I think it's here. Yeah, I know, this is it! Besh's little, tiny bladder finally paid off. Alright, you better be right, dude. Hey, we... we shouldn't be here. Ah, don't be a puss. First of all, this sign is like 30 years old. Second they just don't like hunters and shit out here. There isn't a house for miles. Let's just throw up a few tents and chill. Besides, who's gonna know? I don't tell a lot of people this, alright? But you're family, so that's different. I re... I recently went to go see a hypnotist. I'm not talking one of them TV assholes that scam your money. I'm talking, like, a real doctor-type individual. Well, what'd he say? See, you sell yourself short when you do that. You know what I'm talking about. Now, are all docs dudes? They are not. Not all docs are dudes. Okay, what did, uh, what did she say? Apparent... apparently I've been seeing these things going around since I've been pissin' in my diapers. It's one of these.. Depressed memories, you know what I'm sayin'? - Repressed, sugar. - Huh? It's repressed memory, re. Ah, d... d... depressed repressed, abscessed. Anyway, that... some shit that's locked back there. The truth about these things that no little kid's supposed to see. Uncle Brock, I mean.. I don't know what to say. There's nothin' to say, Court. I just hope that whatever it is they came here for they find it and just leave us alone. I hope. We get by how we get by. [dramatic music] [indistinct chatter] Um, inside. I don't know. Impressive. Hey, hey. What'd you say your name was? Besh. - Beth? - Besh. Be-e-eth. Alright. How about you tell us your name, huh? Uh, Possum. Possum? - As in opossum? - Yeah. Yeah, that's what it says on my birth certificate but I... I... I dropped the "O." You know, 'cause it was all I could think about. My... my silent "O." Cool. Do you guys think there's anything to what that creep said at the convenience store? Oh, my God. Baby, really? Wait, wait, what exactly did this creepo say? Nothing. It's stupid. Just forget about it. He didn't even care about the money. It was like he wanted to warn us. He said something about some people going missing a while ago. He said maybe it was a Sasquatch. [laughing] Like Bigfoot? Really? No, Sasquatch. It's different. Anyway.. Anyway, it might be aliens. Ever since the '70s there's been a lot of UFO activity. It's Big Brother that keeps it secret. You know, they have the power because they have the money. And the only power greater than money is knowledge. So, you keep the knowledge out of minds you keep the money out of pockets, boom. The power is yours. Lucifer. Y'all know what Lucifer means? Uh, the devil, duh. Lucifer.. The bringer of light. Yeah, people been scaring each other off of knowledge a long time now. Yeah, parents lie to their children. Ugh. It's precious. Anyway.. Check out what I, Mr. Slickness jacked back at the gas station. Really? You're stealin' shit, dude? It's fucked up. And even worse is calling yourself "Mr. Slickness." [Jeremiah laughing] Fuck, damn, guys. I'm just tryin' to have some fun. No need to get all preachy and start throwin' finger quotes around. Is this a better use of my finger? I'm gonna go find those fuckin' hot springs. If any of you lame-asses wanna be less lame.. Let's roll. Fine. Why does he smoke this stuff? Isn't it pretty bad? The government would like you to think so but mostly, we just we just try not to sleep much is all. Especially at night. They're more likely to come around then. You know, we've learnt how to deal with them over the time. The floodlights, for one thing. They hate floodlights. And then, sometimes.. They tell us things about themselves. Captain really let you have it this time, huh, Derek? Screw Captain Barnes. He's just pissed 'cause it's my face that ends up on the papers for doing a job that he can't even handle. Maybe he's pissed because you assaulted another innocent person. Well, it's not assault if they get between me and this meth case. You consider that collateral damage. Jesus Christ, man. I'll do whatever it takes to get you, Brock. I see you. I wanna.. [whimpering] [growling] [groaning] [gasps] [crickets chirping] Holy motherfuckin' shitballs. Hey. Ah. [sniffs] Oh, if those asswipes could see me now. Screw the hot springs, I found the pot springs. Can't believe I just said that. Where the fuck is he? I mean, I doubt we're even anywhere near the stupid fucking hot springs. Wait, do you think that he met a girl? [laughing] As charming as Zack is, Cassie I doubt he met a girl in the middle of the woods. I'm sure that Zack is just doing whatever Zack does. Getting raped by Sasquatch? Yes. 'Miah. I'm sure he's fine, Cass. Oh, man. [sniffs] God, those guys are gonna shit when they see what Dr. Slickness pulled off this time. [chuckles] Anyone who doesn't see the system is corrupt doesn't see at all, is all I'm sayin'. I've been up and I've been down both directions, shit is crooked. You know, I bet, I bet you're one of those kids from the suburbs that just decided one day to go follow a band around on tour, right? Look, I've... I've made plenty of money up here. Enough to get corrupted. You know, I thought I was better than people. That's what money will tell you, man. Whisper it, right in your... fuckin' ear. So, what, you were a dick to your friends or somethin'? Nah. I went to jail. Didn't stick though. What? You got caught dealin' weed and they dropped the charges? Like everybody in California? No, I... I killed somebody. Allegedly. You know, I... I... I got a good lawyer. Even better doctor that made me look crazier than a shithouse rat took all my money brought me back to Earth. As much as I'm ever here. Hey, I'm just... I'm just fuckin' with you guys. It was some weed shit. Like you said, it... it always gets dropped in Cali. You guys are adorable. Let me be perfectly clear, buddy, okay? I went out on a fuckin' limb to pick you up. Don't fuck with me. Okay? Now, who the fuck is worried about Zack? I mean, I... I don't think the guy knew where the hot springs were and I doubt he could even find his way home from the grocery store. I'm sorry, Cassie, but who's gonna come find this jackass with me? Okay. Wait, wait, wait. What? No, I'm sorry, you're breakin' up. Okay, yeah, yeah, now I can hear you. What I was saying is.. I'm freaking out. It's weirder than usual. My uncle is saying some shit in the woods. I don't know, like.. What? [gasps] What are you doin', Court? I... I was just callin' a girlfriend to tell her that, you know I'm a little spooked with everything that's... that's goin' on. What exactly is goin' on, Court? Huh? Didn't I tell you to put that up? Don't you know that they can pick up your signal? They'll get your information. Heck, they'll get.. Hell, I don't know all the shit the bastards are capable of. - I don't fuckin'... - Uncle! Uncle Brock, I love you. But I am scared. I mean, yesterday yesterday everything was normal. And today, we got aliens? You know? I'm sorry, sweetheart. I've been wrapped up in this so long I forget what it must be like just comin' into this kind of knowledge. Alright, well, go on inside, pumpkin'. Go on inside with your auntie. I'm gonna make my rounds. [instrumental music] I'm gonna be rich. And high... and rich. [howling] [growling] [screaming] Deuces. [screeching] [leaves rustling] [growls] [gunshot] [gunshot] Oh, fuck. [instrumental music] Bring me that bottle, baby. [grunts] [glass shatters] We celebratin', sweetie! - I got one! - Oh! Ah! There were a million of them little fuckers and, all of a sudden all of them, they just disappear. And then, suddenly, one comes outta nowhere slowly, but he don't see me, right? - And then, bam! - Oh, yeah! Oh, I got the sumbitch. Oh, baby. You okay, sugar? - Am I okay? - Yeah. - Am I okay? - Yeah! Yeah, baby, I'm okay. I swear that was a gun. Might be good ol' boys havin' a get together. Maybe growers remindin' trespassers where they're at. Don't trip. How can you be so sure it wasn't some psycho? What's more likely? A, out here in the middle of the Emerald Triangle the country's largest producer of marijuana someone's lettin' off warnin' shots, or B.. Charles Manson's havin' a little Helter Skelter reunion tour? [laughs] Pick up, come on. Pick, pick, pick. [footsteps approaching] The fuck are you doin'? No! [groaning] [whimpering] Brock? Baby.. Baby, are you sure that she's helpin' them? No, goddammit! I ain't fuckin' sure! Look, all I'm sure of is that she was on that goddamn cell phone after I told her to put it up and after I shot one of them goddamn things. And I... I ain't takin' no chances. That's it. I ain't taking no goddamn chances. Okay, alright. Alright, let's get her in the goddamn closet while I have a chance to sort this shit out. What? - Well, I, uh... - What, goddammit? You wanna put her in the closet? [whimpering] Courtney baby.. [whimpers] if you in there, if you in there I want you to know I love you and I know if you involved in this in any way it ain't your fault, honey. I'm just doin' this 'cause I love you and I'm tryin' to protect ya. [whimpering] Okay? Alright, let's go. - Let's go! - Okay. [distant screaming] I hate this place. I hate the woods. I hate camping. [distant howling] What the fuck is that? - It's probably coyotes. - You sure? Do you know what probably means? It could be Bigfoot.. Or Bigfoots.. Or Bigfeet? Alright, it's Bigfoots, not Bigfeet. Yeah, I think he's right. Bigfoots, that makes sense. That Bigfoot shit, that's, that's no joke. Neither are the UFO sightings. My friends, they... they seen some crazy shit in these woods, man. Incidentally, were these friends of your 'shrooming, or.. Incidentally, yeah. Yeah, some of the time. Some of the time, they were sober though, so.. But I tell you, man, I think there's a connection between hallucinogenic drugs and aliens. You could tap in if you were really open to it. I wouldn't mind tappin' somethin'. Oh, Bigfeet aliens, fucking coyotes.. [sighs] I miss my apartment. I miss the Mindy Project. Mindy Project. Fuck it, you guys seem cool. This will get you fuckin' there. What is that, blow? No, no, no. No, no, no. It's better. It's pure, fresh, local emerald ice. Emerald? It looks white. Uh, as... as in triangle. It's Emerald Triangle. [snorting] Ooh-ooh-ooh! Oh. Shit just get too real, maybe? No, shit's just not my apartment. What? Are you sure the closet was really necessary? - Jesus. - She's scared, Brock. Well, she's scared? You don't think I'm scared? Jesus Christ. Look.. What if she ain't her? Not her? - Well, who is she? - Well, that's just it. I don't fuckin' know. I don't know. I don't know. She could be tryin' to trick us, right? We cannot, under any goddamn circumstances allow them to make us vulnerable because we have human emotions. Alright? I know Court's also in there, goddammit. I know that, I know that! 'Cause I guaran-fuckin-tee if she weren't she wouldn't be under this roof. In the mornin' we'll let her out, okay? We'll reassess the situation. - Okay? - Yeah. Now, worst-case scenario she's a little pissed. - She's a little pissed. - Yeah. I buy her breakfast, I apologize. We good. But, if she ain't her.. [sighs] She better off in there. This way, I can keep her safe. [tapping] I got it. God, I'm so tired of this shit. We'll pull through, babe. Oh! Goddamn Chinese fuckin' generator! I'll get it, hon! Try an' relax! I'm fuckin' relaxed. [door closes] [instrumental music on television] Alright, you ready? Born ready. Brock, we know you're in there. [pounding on door] Police! Open up! Last chance. Holy fuck, Brock! I've never seen so many and they're all over the house. I was kickin' that thing and there are so fuckin' many of them I barely got the thing goin'. They're just all over the place and the floodlights came on and they export or teleport or whatever the fuck they do but I don't... Sugar, shh. Come on, sugar. We're not ready for them. Baby, we ready. I don't think we're ready... We gonna be ready. - There's too many... - We gonna be ready. - Know that. - Okay. - Okay? Alright. - Okay. The fuck are you, Zack? [tapping] The hell was that? A... alright, seriously, what the fuck was that? Let's find out. What a freak. [hammering] Why, this should slow 'em down. It's not gonna keep 'em out, but it'll slow 'em down, I think. - You get the traps set? - I got the traps. We're gonna set, we're gonna set them next. - Yeah. - Gotta secure the base. [hooting] [purring] Hold on, little baby. [purring] I'm comin'. [purring continues] Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. [indistinct] Ya gotta keep your head in the game. - It's in it! - Stay focused. - Stay vigil. - I... you confused me. If you see somethin', say somethin'. Get your nails. [leaves rustling] I saw a Grey. A visitor. That dude seemed cool. Oh, a... a Grey visitor? Yeah, don't you watch The History Channel? Yeah, yeah, a Grey alien. They're the most common to visit Earth. You know, I know quite a lot about history but from school. Well, there's your first mistake. Right, 'cause TV is a much better teacher. Yes. Yeah, there's a bunch of different kinds of aliens. From all different, different galaxies and different dimensions. That dudes that built the pyramids are w-a-a-ay different than the greys, you know. The greys are just, just tryin' to study us. You know, they wanna learn how the Anunnaki made us. What the fuck is an Anunnaki? Okay, try to keep up. I only wanna explain a million years of history once, okay? So, the Anunnaki, they... they're the guys from Egypt and Sumeria. You know, they're... they're the ones that made us. You saw one of these Anunnaki in the woods? No, no, don't be foolish. I saw... I saw a Grey. I saw a Grey, and he was... Hey, can you guys stop that for, like, two seconds? Look, maybe he saw an alien, maybe he didn't. You heard what he said. The little dude was nice. He was tryin' to teach me. Gonna offer him some candy or maybe a gentle bro'ing. I'm sure Jeremiah and Zach are out, blazin' up talking about girls or guitars or whatever. Yeah, I know what I saw. Gee-tars. [door opening] Yeah, yeah, they tough, they tough. But they still animals like we got here. I'm sure they got special powers and technology and shit but they still flesh and blood. And I know, 'cause I've killed enough of 'em. Now, this might not catch 'em necessarily. But it's gonna fuck 'em up. It's gonna fuck 'em up pretty good. Let's get these traps set. I'm getting the willies out here. - Hey. - I hate tonight. This is my every night, Peggy. I love ya and I wish none of this on you. What? An idea come to me. You get these set. I've gotta build somethin' inside. Okay. How the hell do you know all of this? Like I said, History Channel talks about it. There're a lotta books too. There's, um, "Behold The Pale Horse" "Fingerprints Of The Gods" "Magicians Of The Gods." Fuck. Ev... even... even Nat Geo'll throw some clues out there. Yeah, the day after the, uh, the crash in Roswell a local paper put out a story sayin' it was a f... flyin' saucer. That was a government statement. Next day, they retracted it, why? I mean, maybe there was a mistake or misprint or something. No, no, no, no, no, no. Think about what would happen if everyone found out that these dudes were comin' down and takin' people. People would f... fucking flip out. We'd see nobody has control. We don't have control. Have you ever considered your sources might not be a 100 percent? Has it ever occurred to you that nothing that human beings know or do is a 100 percent? Do you answer every question with a question? Do you? Alright. Well, at least he's thinking of something. He definitely saw something out there. The only thing that is for certain is that this guy is high. High on drugs I shared with you, bro. You know what else? I'mma find your boy. I'm gonna find your boy. Mr. Slickness? What's his name? Mr. Slickness. I'mma find Mr. Slickness, yeah. Come here, baby brother. You watch them. Okay. Okay. Alright. Thank you. Be careful. Alright. I'm going to my tent. What the hell were you thinking? Well, I was thinking I wanted to stop the son of a bitch who was pumpin' his poison into our community.. Sir. - I told him... - Shut the hell up, Jackson. Do you know what it would look like if this got out to the public? Do you? Do you? It would look like somebody's finally doing your job. Gleesh nosh nish nosh. Ginish nish nosh loke. [door opens] Baby. Baby, how long was I out there for? You get your traps set? I... I was setting that last one and then... then.. One of those things showed up. See, they're already messin' with the TV. I... started makin' this for Court. Then I could bring her back. What is it? It's a wave-transmission- blocking helmet. This is a military technology. Leaked out to the public quick enough. Come here. I don't know if this is going to be enough to bring her back. They might already be in too deep. Go get some bobby pins, would you, baby? Alright. It's okay, darlin'. Uncle Brock thinks he figured out a way to help. Look, I ain't a 100 percent. But I reckon this just might block them signals comin' into your head. Yeah. Okay, secure the bobby pins. It's just a little pin. It's okay, it's just a little pin. I'm just pinnin' it. There ya go. - Hurry now. Come on now. - Almost. It looks kinda nice. - Would you stop? - Okay. Baby.. Nice work. What exactly were you meant to catch? You're relieved of your duties tonight, buddy. [trap slams] Ohhh. What happened to you? Who did this to you? Calm down. Tell me. Oh. Ohh. Zack! Zack! Zack, where.. Zack. Zack, what the fuck happened? What the fuck did you do, dude? Fuck! Zack. This over some fucking weed? [intense music] [alien growling] How many times do I have to ask ya? How long you been scoring from Brock? I don't know a Brock. To a tweaked-out scumbag like yourself he may be God. Let me tell you somethin'. He ain't no God. He's not even a man. Look, if I knew who this guy was, I... I would tell you. You just sit there with a shit-eating grin plastered all over your face tellin' me you don't know who the fuck this guy is? - Yeah. - Never seen him before? I'm serious! Well, I don't buy that. I'm tellin' the truth! Derek, no, no. No! Hey! Hey! Hey! Calm down now! [spluttering] [crying] [intense music] [alien growling] [screaming] Let's do something different. Different? How different? [Besh squeaks] [giggles] [whispering] I don't wanna bug poor Cassie. [chuckles] Let's go do something different. [laughs] Come on. [whistling] [trap slams] Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Well! Yeah! They still flesh and blood, ain't they? Okay. [inhales deeply] God! I promise. I promise. I promise. [coughs] [dramatic music] You ain't so bad now, are ya? [alien growling] What? What? How 'bout this? You speak a little English tell me what you freaks are after and I'll let you go. If not... we gonna perform a little brain surgery. What? We was.. I miss my mother. [alien growling] Well, okay. How about I take a little peek at yours? How'd that be? Huh? - No. - You know what I mean? [grunts] Now, that's gonna leave a mark. This here's gonna leave a wedge. [grunting] [distant yelling] Oh, fuck! [grunting] Aah! [grunting] Like I was sayin' intergalactic, mind-fuckin' son of a bitch. [door opens] [screams] Holy Mother. What is that? Proof! That's what it is. Proof! I mangled the other one pretty bad to get a sample, but look at this goddamn thing. That's what I'm talking about. Get some freezer bags, baby. Now, I'd mount it right up there if it didn't smell like shaved ass. Shaved ass juice. Ugh. Ugh, it's touchin' me. I know. It'll sting a little bit right at first. Then, it goes away. It's fine. Get in there. Oh, yeah. I got you! You done! You barbecue. Yeah. [gasps] [whimpers] [instrumental music] [whistling] [humming] Hm. [humming] I should've been a kindergarten teacher. [grunting] Fuck. [grunting] [breathing heavily] [door opens] [instrumental music] - Peggy. - Hm? You really are quite the homemaker. Yeah, my momma always said "Peggy, if you're gonna do it "why do it wrong once if you could do it right twice?" My mom always just punched me in the face told me not to smoke in the house. And I got, I got a different color marker for every single bag, so we can help keep it nice and, like, organized. You would've been one helluva kindergarten teacher. Alright, let's do this. Those other SOBs are comin' and they ain't gonna be too happy that I killed two of their compadres. Let's do it. This is probably far enough, right? No. I wanna find a clearing. I wanna see some stars. Okay. God.. Are you sure you know exactly what you're doin', baby? Well, I don't know exactly, but.. I do know I can't shove the whole goddamn thing in the freezer. I can use a hand over here. Grab the.. Uh, can you... can you just hand me the, um.. The... the.. Can you just.. [gags] [Peggy vomiting] You want me to hold your hair for ya? God. [saw whirring] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - Baby. - Yeah? Do you not see the joy around us? The lovely weed garden? This pot paradise? Huh? [giggles] You are such a weirdo. And you're all about me. [laughing] Come on. [giggling] Guys? Guys? Come on, guys, this isn't funny. Where the fuck are you? [instrumental music] Oh, God, that.. This is retarded. Alright, well, I guess it's better than nothing. Here we go. [Besh moaning] [Klaus grunting] [Klaus howling] [both moaning] [Klaus howling] The smell don't get any better. [distant howling] Shh, shh, shh. Ya hear that? Good ear, Peg. That ain't no animal. Sounds like it's comin' from the garden. Quick. Get the gun. It's under the bed. [intense music] [door closes] [Klaus grunting] [alien growling] So, this is what they wanted with my weed. [alien growling] Slowly, Peg. [growling continues] Keep me flanked on my right. [both moaning] Baby. Baby! [gunshot] No! Agh! No! Please! No! Please! Aah! No! [growling] You picked the wrong place to start a family. Please! Please! Oh, my God! [growling] [gunshot] [dramatic music] Fuck! [grunting] Come on, Cassie. [sighs] At least I'm fucking tryin'. I fucking hate you guys. I swear when I get back I am gonna go to the gym everyday and I'm gonna eat really well and I'm gonna call my mom. And I swear to God, I am never, ever fucking going camping again. You guys, we gotta, uh.. Hey, Klaus! Besh! Ah, fuck. Cassie! Cassie! Just think, Peg, if we hadn't intervened when we did, these things would've been parents. Uh, sugar.. What's that? [instrumental music] Oh, my God. People. I'm not sure, but I got a pretty good idea. Probably sent a scout. I doubt they sent one to surrender. Cassie! Cass! Actual people. Oh, my God. [intense music] Welcome to Willits. [gunshot] Well, shit. What are we supposed to do now? Now, we have another one to deal with. Should we bury 'em? I'm not gonna show 'em that much respect. Well, they're not gonna all fit in the freezer. - You think I'm stupid? - No. Well, that's a rhetorical question, honey 'cause I know they ain't all gonna fit in the goddamn freezer. But, baby, my parents are comin' in a week. What am I supposed to say? That we got rotten jack-o'-lanterns all over the yard from Halloween? Why can't your parents just stay in Shreveport like my parents? Okay, look. We burn 'em in the burn barrel. We use the ashes for fertilizer. Alright. [grunting] [grunts] Shit. [dramatic music] Ah, fuck. Fuck. Zack. Where'd you put 'em? You think they come from, like.. One of those like really far planets or somethin'? I heard that Pluto's far... Yeah, well, it ain't local. You see that right there? Maybe that's where they're from... - Damn it, Peg! - No! Why do you always do that? What difference does it make what planet galaxy, dimension they come from, okay? Why do you always do that? Sorry. Their family's lookin' at us. Don't, you don't always have to know every goddamn thing that I'm doin' here. - Just let me do my job. - Okay? - Okay? - Okay. I'm just tryin' to get her done. - I'm just tryin' to help. - Hey, get that. Which one? Yeah, we're gonna save that one. Right here. How 'bout this one? This one's a good one. Put it in. Yeah. Gettin' her done. Well, okay then. Pretty much oughta do 'er. Goddamn, they're fuckin' ugly. Let's send these fuckers back.. From whence they come. Poetic justice. Besides, we don't want 'em stinkin' up the place. - No, we don't. - Two in the woodpile, right? - No, we don't. - Right, Peg? Look at it. [gasps] Look at that. All Halloween orange and chimney red. - Right? - I like it. - Get it. - I'm gonna get more logs. Okay. Now, you keep puttin' them on the fire. - I'm gonna get more gas. - Okay. Them are gonna burn really nice. Hey, baby, where's the goddamn gas can? Ugh.. Let me bring a light. Where's the goddamn gas, Peg? Could you not shine the light in my goddamn face, and shine it down here? I'm tryin'. Well, stop tryin' and start doin'. Did you get more gas like I asked? It's now or never, babe. Obviously I did. What makes it obvious? The fact that I can't find it? Well.. Maybe it was them. What? Them. Maybe it was them? So... they fly high way across the universe would have to siphon fuel for their spaceship? Does that make sense to you? Hm? I'm sorry. I'll get some more tomorrow mornin' before I make you breakfast. I'm gettin' tired, babe. Well, goddammit, I've been tired. No, I mean sleepy, hon. Alright. We'll go back inside and do another hit. We shouldn't even consider sleepin' tonight. They're burnin' good. You think they'll go.. To regular hell? Or you think they go to alien hell? Huh? Well, I don't know, baby. They're burnin' just fine right here on Earth. [chuckles] [door opens] Hon, do you think Courtney needs to use the bathroom? She's been in there a while. I could help her go. Yeah, I guess she do. Alright. I'll help you get her up. She's... she's gone. She's... she's gone! Shit! She, she don't even have this to protect her. Where would she go? Why would she go? Ain't it obvious? Yeah, I guess she got tired of being tied up. Think harder, Peg. You don't think.. [coughs] [car horn blares] Fuck. [dramatic music] Fuck. Shit. Fuck. No fucking way. [chuckles] What? Jeremiah Jones? What are you doing here? I don't even know where to start. - You hurt? - Yeah, but I'm breathing. Okay. Well, we gotta get outta here. I'll drive if you're too hurt... There's no keys in there. What are you doing here? Camping.. Sort of. Tryin' to find these hot springs. Oh. They're right over there. [chuckles] - Are you serious? - Yeah. I've heard gunshots, and my friend.. My friend was shot. My leg.. There's some psycho out here. I don't know what happened after that. I don't even know if any of my friends are still alive. Wait, why, why are you here? I don't think that Courtney would wanna help them, Brock. She loves you. She loves us. Yeah, she loves us, but that ain't really the point now, is it, Peg? 'Cause she ain't really her, is she? I'm... I'm sorry, sugar, I.. You know I just don't think as quick as you can, but I'm, I'm just tryin' to keep up. Well, it ain't always easy havin' this 180 IQ. I think that's why they chose me in the first place. We're too late for you, darlin'. They got in there too deep. They used ya. I was just tryin' to protect ya. What kind of beast has such little regard for human life? Don't they have families of their own? She was like a daughter to me. Alright... let's get to it then. Get to what, baby? Killin' what used to be Courtney. You're good at that. Maybe you're just drunk. Should be good. How are we gonna get outta here? I don't know. Walking's out. We don't have a key. My uncle's van. Do you have the keys? Well.. [intense music] not exactly. Good God, woman, what the hell is takin' so long? I'm just tryin' to find my pepper spray and my... my Dale Earnhardt pocket knife. Goddammit, I told ya to keep that pepper spray in your damn purse. That Dale Earnhardt knife ain't worth a damn. Don't talk that way about Dale, baby. You know better than that. You're right, sweetheart. I guess the Good Lord just needed a driver. Found it. Is there anything else? Like what? You need a Mani-pedi? No. Then, let's go. Comin'. Hey. I think this goes without saying, but.. If we have to do something to my family.. Then that's what we have to do. - Okay. - Right. Court! You out there, darlin'? We're worried. Um.. We're here to help! Court. Darlin'. I know, by God, I didn't I didn't handle everything perfectly. And I know that.. Uh.. I baked ya cookies, Court! What? She likes cookies. Who the fuck bakes cookies at a time like this? I do. I bake 'em all the time. I gotta batch I baked back at the house. [crickets chirping] We got cookies, Court! Did you hear that? - What? - Voices. I think it's my uncle yellin' over there. Isn't that where his garden is? I mean, if he's there, that.. That'd be our perfect chance. [intense music] Come on. [crickets chirping] [owls hooting] [cellphone beeps] You expect me to believe that story? Ha-ha. - Peggy. - About the aliens? [laughs] Tell me what happened to the kids? The kids up there in the woods. All those kids. All those kids, what happened to 'em? You must see. You must see. Ha-ha! You must see. You must see. [laughing] First, you must see. I wanna go back.. I wanna go back.. [speaking in alien language] [gibberish] First, you must see. I can't. [sighs] You. Wha... what's wrong, hon? You were there the whole time. - I was where, sweetie? - "I was where, sweetie!" Just tell me this, Peg. Did you get enough fuckin' samples? [screams] Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for my sins, oh, Father. [grunts] [Brock screams] We should pick up the pace. - Come on. - Okay. You've always been weak, Peggy. Please, just one bar. Please. [groans] Oh, please. Please, one bar, please. I can hear you, Peggy. You can't run. If you keep running, you're gonna get tired. You get tired, you're just gonna get cranky. Aah! Oh. Ah. [mumbling] [intense music] [crying] I'm so sorry, Court. I'm so sorry, God. I'm so sorry for all my sins. Is that what I think it is? Yeah. Sorry. Look, I'm gonna run inside grab the keys and be right out. I'm not a cripple. I know, but that engine is loud as fuck and as soon as I start it, we're gonna need to fuckin' move. You good? Fair enough, but just in case.. Be careful. [instrumental music] How long's this been going on, Peg? How fucking long has it been going on? Huh? Hours? Days? Years? Have you been involved from the beginning? Hell, I'll bet you're even the one who brought Courtney to them. You fucking bitch. [Peg crying] [screaming] Why? She was my own flesh and blood. How could you? I can't even look at you. [gasps] [sobbing] Shut up. Shut up. Don't you say nothin', okay? I'm a bad guy, but I have compassion. Unlike you. Baby, I can't hear you. You gotta enunciate. I mean, where are your manners? [screams] [sobbing] Just kill me. Just kill me. Kill me. Just kill me. That's not what I was expecting to hear. [sobbing] Anything for.. Anything for you, baby. Okay. [intense music] [music continues] [screams] [gasps] Well, there you are. Fuck. [grunts] [grunting] Ah! [grunts] Come on, asshole. [grunting] [intense music] [grunts] [groans] [grunting] [machine whirring] [instrumental music] [grunting] [sighs] Still like to get that drink Monday? If you're workin'. Think I'm gonna call in sick. Try that. [groans] Jesus fuckin' Christ. Okay, we gotta get you to a hospital fast. Still got a couple of minutes left of consciousness. Might as well not waste it.
