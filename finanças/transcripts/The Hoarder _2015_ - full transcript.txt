What the fuck? I know... I can't believe it. Me neither. Except... I, I can believe it. I mean he's hot, he makes bank... Does, like, P90X every morning. He's perfect. That's the point! This is what happens when you get engaged to Mr. Perfect. Mr. Perfect lives in a universe of limitless booty potential. I mean, come on, what else was he gonna do? He's a guy. You never told me that before. I told you all the fuckin' time, you wouldn't listen. I was happy. Don't I have the right to be happy? Uh... hello, this is America. People's rights get fucked up all the time. So, where's his diary? It's not in his desk anymore. He knows I know something. I got weird and then he got weird... And he's put it somewhere. Like, where? He's got a storage unit. He says we have too much stuff. He's always tidying away my things... It's pathological. Him and his fucking feng shui... So, you just got me 'round here to get wasted. I need your help. What? To break in... Ah, Jesus fuck... No! I don't do that anymore. I need to know. You just can't help yourself, can you? You remember what happened last time you broke into What's his name's email account? And I was right he was still fucking his ex. Ella, you can't pry into everything. If you don't trust him why are you marrying him? It's because I'm marrying him, I need to know. Well... I'm not doing it. I don't know how you talked me into this. It's because you love me. Now I just need to take a look at that diary, Put my mind at ease, case closed. The case with you is never closed, That's the fucking problem. Hey if you do this for me it will be. I swear on the... The holy... Whatever that thing Catholics do. Please, leave god out of it. He's too busy with regular wackos. I don't know why you wanna get married anyway. It's so conventional... I am conventional. You know your problem is you actually believe in All that true love happy ever after crap. If you ask me people aren't suited to marriage. It turns everyone into liars. I mean, do animals get married? Albatrosses mate for life. Yeah but we're not albatrosses, we're bonobos. What? Oh they're monkeys, they're into group sex. Well listen, Molly, I'm not a monkey, I'm not into group sex, and Brad better not be either. And look, it's right up ahead. Why the hell would Brad get a storage unit All the way out here? He's rich. Rich people are cheap. You got your story straight? I don't need a story. He's my fianc?. He's the one who needs to get his story straight. Hey. Hi. Oh, cute.

Just remember we close in 25 minutes! This place is huge. Yeah it's not healthy. What? All this hoarding. You know, people hanging on to crap they don't need And they don't even want. For years and fucking years. Huh. Looks like it's all underground. Hey! Hey! Can you hold the elevator? What floor, ladies? Four, please. You'll need a key for four. Yeah, uh, we have it, somewhere.

Listen, if you're not doing anything later... Yeah, ok, we'll call ya. That was not nice. Seriously? Oh well, hey, you know, if things don't work out with Brad, Maybe you could hook up with that one. Seems like a real smooth operator. We need a key. Yeah. Who is it who taught you how to do that again? Was that that guy Carlos? No, I taught him. Really? Then who taught you? Barry. Barry, the lawyer? Yeah. Whatever happened to him? I really liked him. Uh, he's doing five to 10 in a Buffalo correctional. For what? Financial elder abuse. What the hell is that? He embezzled $50,000 from his grandmother. Molly, wait, look. God, would you chill... Most of the time those things are not even connected. Hamster-boy upstairs is probably just watching porn. See? You just stick it in and jiggle. Hang on. Wait, Molly... Molly! Hey! Why would Brad rent something down here? Yeah, I didn't think he was this cheap. It says 4059. Come on. Come on! Wayne to reception. Wayne to reception. Yeah? You wanna start your final round? I guess... You know, that's a great attitude you got there, Wayne. You're gonna go a long way, believe me. Yeah, like you? Oh that's clever. Yeah, in five years' time when you're still sweeping the floor, You won't feel so clever. Believe me... Hey! Check the fire doors. Right. Check the fire doors. Kid's a moron. Shh! What's that? Ok, I think they all definitely heard that in Nebraska. Oh, very funny. Can we just find this fucking thing and get out of here? Yeah. There it is. You really want to do this? I guess... Right. Give me that thing. Ok. Little trick I learned... From Mr. Five-To-Ten? No, actually, my dad... Geez, Molly. You sure you want to do this? Open it.

I heard her shouting, I just pulled her out of the elevator shaft. She's dead. What? She's dead. Who's dead? Molly, she's dead. Back there, the floor below us. I think she's in shock. Ok. Look at me. Look at me. What's your name? Ella. Ella, I'm Detective Burns, ok? Why don't you just tell me what's going on here? We went down... My fianc? has a unit... There was something in there. It... It killed my friend. Oh my God. Ok, Ella. Here's what I need you to do. Ok? I need you to stay with this lady right here. What's your name? Yo! What's your name? Oh, Willow. Willow, I need you to stay with Willow. What's the number of your unit down there? Ok? Come on, what is it? 4059. Ok. You're not gonna just leave us? I'm just gonna go check it out I'll be right back, ok? Ok? Ok. Ok. What the...? Huh? Fuck! They're homeopathic. Here, take one. No thanks, I'm ok. You sure? They have extract of cava root. They're great for anxiety. They're completely natural. I actually sell them online. I went through a divorce last year, And I basically lived on these things. Where's Molly? Who? My friend! Where is she? Couldn't find anyone down there. What? But she's down there, I'll show you. I didn't see anyone. Do you think I'm lying? I didn't say that. Who'd you say attacked you? It wasn't a person. What do you mean it wasn't a person? You mean, like an animal? No, it was like a wild... Person. Ah, are you on something? Have you been taking drugs? What? Marco Perugia's... I can't find my red Marco Perugia's... What box did you put them in? I really have no idea, Sarah. Ugh, for God's sake... What is your stuff doing in my pile? This is supposed to be my pile. It's in my pile now. You happy? I'll be happy when we're finally divorced. Alright? Yeah, we're closing up, so you gotta leave. Um, we really need some more time Could you hold on a little while longer? Uh... sorry. It's just, I came all the way from Manhattan and I really need to do this now. I really appreciate it. Alright. You got 10 minutes. Ok. Well, you could've said something. Ah, what exactly did you expect me to say? Um, I command you to keep this establishment open in the Name of my soon-to-be ex-wife's titanic sense of entitlement? You know, Ian, you're a real asshole. Well, I learned from the best. Hello? Hello? These fucking people, man. How... Oh shit. Ok, let's go over this again. Look, I already told you. We were going to my fianc?'s unit. Why would he have a unit down there? That floor obviously hasn't been used in years. I don't know! Are you sure you're not on something? What is it with you people? Not everyone is on drugs. Hey, hey, hey, hey! You gotta bring it down a notch. Let's go back, huh? How'd you even get down there? We put a wire in the keyhole. My friend is good at that stuff. What about this, huh? What about it? That unit is on this level. Three, one, four, two. 31-42. You were looking at the last four digits of The account number. Does your fianc? even know about this? Look, I thought he was seeing someone else, ok? I just wanted to have a look. Jesus. Why are you asking me all these questions? Molly is missing we have to go find her. I told you, I didn't see anyone down there. But if there is, that's a problem. And I need to get you guys to safety, ok? Ok. There's cameras all over the place. Let's just go upstairs and Then you can make them look at the tape. Well they have to, you're a cop, right? Sure. Sure. We can try. Yeah, ok. Elevator's out... Ah, we gotta use the stairs. I think they're, uh... I think they're this way. Come on. Wait! Can... can I just get something out of my unit? I'll just be a minute. No one's stopping ya. But... But yeah! Come on! Oh, god damned kid! Wayne! Wayne! Wayne! Wayne! Wayne! Wayne! Check the fire doors, that's all I asked him to do. It's not rocket science. Goddamned youth employment program. You try and help out a kid, Put something back into the community... What do you get? Retards with attitude. Oh my god. Why the hell did I let you pack? I mean how could I possibly be that dumb? You're taking 60% of my assets in income. You can't be that dumb. Well I earned every cent, believe me. Where the fuck are my Marco Perugia's. You wanna consider helping? A little bit? Don't you think as we stand here among the ruins of our marriage, There might be more important things to think about than a Pair of fucking shoes? Such as what, Ian? To think I once felt emotions for you, Describable as love. You see, that's that maudlin streak of yours... You know, tell me, How's that playing with the girls these days? It's funny, no one ever called me maudlin before I met you. You seem to have that effect on men. One... Particular man. Doesn't seem to affect the others. Speak of the others, how is Doug? I don't see so much of him these days, Now that he's fucking you. Yeah, well at least he does fuck me. For the moment. Well, you should talk to him. You know, he seems to be enjoying himself so far. Very good. I really get a kick out of these conversations, Sarah. Well, unless you want to spend another delightful evening in This shithole together, why don't you go on upstairs and Talk to those assholes and get them to keep this place open? Fine. Fuck! It's locked? Why is it locked? Hey! Yo! Yo! Can't you open it? How am I supposed to open it? Haven't you got one of those keys? What keys? I don't know, I thought you guys always had keys. Lady, lady, I'm a cop, not a locksmith. Shit. Ok, so we're trapped. We're not trapped. Ok, I can't stay here. I have diabetes I need my medication. You're gonna get your medication, ok? Don't worry about it. You gotta check your cell phones, ok. I lost mine. If I miss a dose, it's dangerous. You're gonna get it, ok? Any signal? No. Hey! Hey, what's going on? That the man? No, I told you, it wasn't a man! What man? Ah! There you are! Ian? Ian, did you speak to those guys? You know what? Fine, just don't talk to me. I cannot wait to not have to deal with your bullshit anymore. Ian? Ah! These goddamned lights! Ah, did you see it? No. She may be on drugs. Will you stop saying that? I told you all I'm not on drugs! Are you? Me? No! Really? You pop enough of those pills. Look, that thing killed my friend, And it's still down there. Christ! Wait! Well, what are we gonna do? Get in the corner. Just stand back. God damn it! There's gonna be a rational explanation for this. Right. That's why you just tried to shoot your way out of here. There could be more people down there. We should warn them. Ok, let's go. Sarah! Sarah! Sarah! Oh, fuck's sake! Sarah! Sarah? Sarah? Sarah? Now do you believe me? Get behind me. She's gone. Police! Hold it right there! I only left her a couple of minutes. I said 'stop'! Oh Jesus Christ! You have to help me find Sarah. I need you to stay calm. What? Sir, I need you stand up against the wall there. What are you talking about? We have to find Sarah! Who's Sarah? My wife... That is, my ex-wife... Actually, she's still my wife... My soon-to-be-ex-wife. Why are you pointing that thing at me? What's your name? Ian. We have to find Sarah! Ian, we gotta be smart. What do you mean, smart? This place is huge, You can't just bust open every door. We don't even know what's happening down there. What's happening just happened to my wife! That's her blood, for fuck's sake! We don't know that for sure. You're just going to abandon her. I'm not saying that. Look, maybe the best way to find your wife is to find A way out of here and call the police. I thought he was the police! I am the... Put down your weapon! Who the fuck are you? Police! Put your fucking weapon down! Any of you seen him before? It wasn't him. You sure? He was kinda weird with us earlier, but... Hey, wait a... wait a minute. What's in your unit? I'm a cop. There are two women missing down here. You're a cop? Where's your uniform? Detective homicide. I'm gonna take a look inside. You can't do that you need a warrant. Is this really necessary? You can't do this, you don't have the right. You shut the fuck up. Hey! Get off my stuff! You're living here? So the fuck what? I lost my job, ok? What? Is that a crime now? You got a job? And you? He's got a gun and a job. Big guy! What is that? Don't touch that! It was my grandfather's. It's ceremonial. What for? Beheadings? Fuck you. This is my place! I want your badge number. I don't have to take this shit. Ok, just calm down. Ok, didn't I just tell him to shut the fuck up? Why the fuck should I calm down? Shut up. Listen. I told you, there are two women missing here, ok? His wife may have been abducted... Her friend might have been murdered. Somebody killed your friend? It wasn't somebody, it was something. You know, there is something weird going on down here. I moved in like, three days ago... Couldn't make my rent, my landlord threw me out... Fucking Bible-thumping hypocrite... Yeah, yeah, ok, we get it. Go on. Second night after the place closed down, I heard these noises... What noises? I don't know, noises, like this weird fucking moaning. I always knew this place had a bad energy. I pick up these things... I'm very intuitive. Where do these noises come from? I don't know. I was in here. They sort of floated around, do you know what I mean? Not really. Were they on this level? No, they kinda came from below. So the basement, level four. I didn't know there was a level four. I already was down on that level, There's nothing going on down there. Molly is down there! I don't know shit about Molly or nothing like that On that level, but on this level We got a person missing and I gotta get us out of here. And how are we going to do that? They lock this place up pretty tight at night... Yeah tell me about it. But there's a maintenance closet just down the hallway. I wasn't trying to be weird... I just thought it would be nice to like, hang out. Nice for me, anyway. I get awkward when I talk to girls. And then I lost my job. It wasn't much of a catch in the first place. What's your name? Rashid. Will you shut the fuck up? Yeah, that's it. They use these to cut through people's padlocks, Like when they don't pay their rent. Check this out! Are you ok? No, I'm not ok... Why would anyone be ok in this situation? Sorry, my blood sugar's getting too high. Ok, come on, let's go! Damn it! Goddamn timer switches. Come on! Wait a minute. Good job. You know, it's no smoking down here. Eat me. Hey, come on! We're wasting time. Let's go. We gotta cut the chain upstairs. Ah, what about my wife? I thought we settled that question. No, we didn't. We didn't settle anything. Look, I gotta think about the safety of these women, alright? Oh, sure you do! What about my safety? Guys... Come on. You said you were getting divorced right? Yes. She left you, is that right? Probably had an affair? Yeah, thought so. You learn to read these things in my job. What'd she get? What? In the settlement, more than half, right? Well, she... Right? She takes all your money, Probably fucking some other guy, right? That's gotta, that's gotta really hurt, huh? And what's this gotta do with you? Ok, you go back downstairs... We come down, there's blood all over the floor, You come back and tell us she's missing. What the fuck are you saying? You don't really think... You, me, her were upstairs, sure as hell wasn't one of us. You bastard! You got something else you wanna say? Thought not. What's going on? Fuck, You tripped the fucking fire alarm. We need to get to the stairs! It's here! Clear! Get the fuck off me! Get out of the way! I tagged it. It's ok. Right shoulder. It's ok now. I just want to go home. It's gone. What the fuck was that? I don't know. I guess you were right. Where's Rashid? Hey! Shit! Hey! Hey! Shit! Can you guys hear me? That thing attacked us. Seriously? Yeah. You need to get to the stairs... And cut the chain. Hey! Wait a minute. What? There is something there. What? What's his name? Rashid. Rashid! What's happening, Rashid? Can't see. Hey! Stay back! Rashid! Rashid! Rashid! Oh my God! We're all going to die. We're not gonna die. We are! Look... We're all gonna die! We're all gonna die! We're all gonna die! We're all gonna die! We're all gonna die! We're all gonna die! We're not all gonna die. Ok. Ok. Now what? Huh? I don't know. I thought you had it all worked out. Not now, asshole. Why not now, asshole? Hey! There's another door. At the other side of the building. Maybe there's a stairwell there! Why the hell didn't you tell us before? I didn't know, I thought it was locked! Ok. Let's go. You? You do whatever you want. I think you better come with us. You'll be no good to your wife if you're dead. This way? Yeah. Back up! Fuck! Alright, level one. We can cross to the other stairwell. No! Fuck! Give me those. But there was no fire up here! Ok, let's go. Fuck! What are we going to do now? We'll go to level three. You think that won't be blocked too? That's where we need to go. There's nowhere else. That's down. Why would you want to go down? Hello? We're not getting out this way. You know I'm right, don't you? Well, I guess we'll just keep on going then. Just keep on talking buddy, I like the sound of your voice. Guys like that, they need to think they're in control, They get outside their comfort zone, They start to lose it. Are you a psychologist? I work in advertising, but you don't need a PhD... Look, maybe if you think he's gonna start losing it, You shouldn't wind him up. One, two, three, four. What are you doing? There's something in here I need. What is this a fucking donut break? Ok. What've you got in there? My packed lunch. You touch that again, you're gonna regret it. You just dragged us all the way down here, You can damn well tell us why. I don't have to tell you shit, okay? You wanna find your own way out of here? Be my fucking guest, alright? What, you, you think we're following you Because of your, uh... Your leadership skills? Because of your, uh... Outstanding, problem-solving intellect? Oh, we're following you because of that. This? Huh! Vince! This... Is telling you to stop being an asshole and shut the fuck up. Let him go! Vince, for Christ's sake! What's that? It's not what you think. Oh, sure, he's collecting for Africa. You brought us down here for that? You risked our lives for that? He had to. If we get out of here, there'll be an investigation. They would've found his bag. Well, he's right, isn't he? What're you gonna do, you're gonna shoot us? You're gonna shoot me? And what, on TV? K, you're gonna, you're gonna back up right now, ok? I mean it. Ok, that's good, that's good. Yeah. New York's finest. What'd you say? What'd you say you do? Advertising? So you spend your day lying to everybody and you make, what? Two, 300 a year? Condo in Manhattan? Expense account, Company car for those weekends in the Hamptons... Me? I put my life on the line everyday, For 70K, before taxes. I got three kids, mortgage is fucking killing me, House is under the water, I, I can't even fucking sell it, And some prick like you comes in here and tells me 'suck it up!'? Hey! Hey! Let him go. What are we gonna do now? Without a gun, we're defenseless. Level four. No. When Molly opened the door, she said she felt a draft. Maybe there's an air vent, or something. There must be a way out. I'm gonna pass out. I can feel it. I need to get to my unit, there's insulin in there. Where, where is it? I'll get it. No, no, no, no, you, you won't find it. Ah, it'll be quicker if I go alone.

We're all in pain. She's going anywhere in this state. Just give me a minute. We're gonna have to leave her in here. What? We're locking you in. No! We're just gonna go and get help. You're probably safer in here anyway. Maybe there's something in here that we could use. Here's a scalpel. There's something better, over there in that box. Vitamin E supplements. Open it. I bought it to protect myself, But I've never even picked it up. Always been too scared to. But what about you? That thing shows up, It's getting 100 milligrams of Propofol. It's a pre-med. Knock out an elephant. Is it locked? Yes... Don't open it for anyone. Hey, thank you. For what? For being ok. So what brought you here tonight? Uh, I was looking for something in my fianc?'s unit.
