Maybe next time, bring back some horses. Save my back, huh? Yeah, I don't think they'd deal with the journey. Then I guess you're stuck with me then. I guess so. - Aylmer! - Lani, beautiful as ever. - Thank you. - Great to see you. All good, boss? We're good, those are for Kalima. - Oh, my knight in shining armor. - M'lady. - I'll make some tea. - That sounds good. - Did you manage to find me any-- - I did. You know, for someone who loves the quiet life, you are obsessed with modern convenience. Here you go. Ingenuity through struggle. Hey, makin' something cool? I don't know, underwater flashlight. - What do you think? - Yo! Hi, can I get one of those? - Yeah, sure. - Thank you. Ladies. A question. Well, it's a request more than a question. Spit it out then. How can we help? I am looking for a linen, you know, spare linen for my bait. - Your bait getting cold? - No, it's getting loose. - You know, I've had an idea to-- - Absolutely not. With linen? No. Uh-- Leave it with us. We'll see if we have anything that will work. Thanks. - A few additions.- - Okay, let's have a look. Anything else? All right, leave with me. - I'll see you in a week. - Mahalo. Who knows it? Only you two? Once she gets at it. - Good? - Mm-hmm. Ah, so good, thank you. Ah! What do you say, we skip dinner? I say that by the time dinner rolls around-- You, you did this. - Uh, what, me, me, what, what'd I do? - You should've been there! I shouldn't have been doing it alone. Okay, well I'm sorry you got-- You've been shirking your responsibilities and sneaking off with her. It's unacceptable! - Just let her help you then. - I don't need her help. Okay then, let's go back to the farm and discuss this like men, yeah? There's no need to talk, this is your fault. Okay, it's my fault, you happy? What's going on? Hey, what happened to your arm? - This alaho did this to me. - Hey, what-- - Enough with the name-calling. - What, you did this to him? No, he did it to himself. Hey, you watch what you say about my girl. - Hey! - Haku! What are you-- Uh, no, I, I'm sorry. I, I, I know, I'm sorry. Okay, I didn't mean for that to happen. - I didn't, I didn't mean for that. - No! - Hawila, stop. - No! - Get off of him! - Stop! Haku. Enough! And well? Well, what? What have you got to say for yourself? I told you I was sorry. And you shouldn't have said that about Lani. That's not an apology. Well, neither is that. You know who I am? Who my father is, who my grandfather was? Fifty years ago, he would have been hanged for this, banished at least. Everyone appreciates what your family has done for the islands. But that was then, this is now. Yes, well in Aylmer's absence, we are all your subjects. You are to take care of us as best you can. No one will be killed or banished for a simple misunderstanding. Simple misunderstanding? He struck me! How do you expect me to work with him again? I don't. You'll work with me, fishing detail. - Hey, I'm, I'm not a fisherman. - Not yet. Apologize to Lani. That's it? He shirks on me, he shirks on the whole village. That's the end of it. Sunrise. Don't be late. - What? - Nothing. Oh, it's something. I know you're not the best dancer, but you were never this bad. What's going on in that head of yours? He thinks I'm weak. Don't mind Hawila. He will fare. But Haku did hit him, and people are angry. You're the island protector: Because John Reaney died. Because you are a man of integrity. I'm a hunter, I'm not a leader. Leader isn't someone who uses others to make him strong, Ben. It's someone willing to give their strengths to others. Sounds simple. Aylmer believes in you, I believe in you. The people of Niihau believe in you and your decisions. I think this thing is stupid, it's not even working. A poor workman blames his tools, man. Aw, yeah, yeah, it's easy for you to say, you're the guy who never-- What is that? Wait, Ben, wait! - Ben! - Haku, no. - Ben! - Hey, Haku, don't! Let's go, let's go! - With me. Grab the gear. - Got it. Lani, clear the table! - What happened? - His plane crashed! - Water. - Okay. Yeah, Ben saved him! He's not saved yet. What can we do? Just go outside, wait, and give us room. Go, go. You can come in now. He looks in bad shape. Well, he looks worse than he is. Water inhalations, his ribs may be broken, sprained shoulder, a few cuts on his head and face, but nothing that won't mend. Can he talk? I've given him something for the pain, but... Do you know where you are? You are on Niihau. Okay, so he can talk. We just can't understand him. It's great. Where's Yoshio? - Ben needs you! - What happened? - Ben needs you! - Is Ben okay? - Haku, wait! - We need you to translate. - Translate? Translate what? - Not what, it's who. Someone order a translator? No, no, you need to rest. What was found on his person? A book in his jacket. - No papers? - No. - Where's his plane now? - At the bottom of the Pacific. Well, what happened? Yoshio? It was engine failure. So, what do we do with him? Same thing we'd do for any visitor. Tell him to rest, he's in good hands. What's going on? I'm getting some extra. You know what I'm talking about. I heard what he said, what he actually said. What did you want me to do? You need to tell Ben. I know, and I will. Just don't say anything until I do. It's been a long day. It has. You did a good thing. I did what anyone else would do. I am not so sure about that. People help when they can. If they can. How they can. I didn't mean to disturb you. You don't have to be afraid of us. We'll take care of you. My husband, Ben, he saved you. You have someone? Back home? When you are better, we will get you back to them. I promise. For now, what say we get you back to Kalima, yes? Are you okay? I'm fine. Just tea. Let me see your hand. I need to clean this up. Yoshio, it's just tea. Show me your hand. Yoshio. I need to tell you something. I don't know how. Whatever it is you can tell me. The pilot. What about him? He didn't crash, he was shot down. By whom? By Americans. I don't understand. Japan and America are at war. No one else knows, no one but Matsu. He heard me mistranslate. Say something. I know I shouldn't have lied, but I did-- I need talk to him. What? We should tell Ben, he'll know what to do. Look what happened with Haku and Hawila, Ben couldn't control that. Talk to Matsu and explain that we need time. Let me talk with the pilot. Shigenori, his name is Shigenori. Matsu. I hope you're here to tell me you've spoken with Ben. We don't know how he'll react, how anyone will. This is someone's son, Matsu, someone's grandson. What if it were you? I'm not asking for much, just time, patience. Where are you going? I don't want anything to do with this, Yoshio. Early morning swim? Something like that. That's a first. It's not a habit. Hey, come on in. You can set that there. How is he? He doesn't really say much. I'm going to change his bandages soon if you wanna help. Can you please pass me my kit? - Is he okay? - Yeah, he's fine. How's it coming? Matsu? He's a genius. Fresh batch. He's a young man. He's alone in a strange place and he's afraid, more than most. You know how that feels. Just talk with him. It'll make sure he's okay. How is he? Physically, he's improving. It'll take some time but-- Can he walk? His shoulder's a bit tender and his ribs are bruised, but he should be okay. We're hoping to move him out of here today. Come with me. We hunt. Why? Why did you save me? Tradition, these things. I should have died. When I found myself here, I didn't know anyone. I didn't have anyone, but I was taken in, given food, shelter, family. So, I guess my tradition dictates that I should help. Tradition is a funny thing. I was trained to be a warrior... once. All I ever wanted was peace. Peace. Family. What do you want now. To go home. I just want to go home. I tried to speak with Matsu. He's not happy, but I don't think he'll say anything. We need to think of a plan, but at least we have some time to decide. No, we don't. There's a beacon on his plane and submarine out there waiting for him. But, but how could they know he's-- Because they told him to land here. We're their contingency. Yoshio, if he hit the beacon, the Japanese know he's here. And if they come for him, they'll slaughter everyone on the island. Wow, impressive. And Niihau is yours, my friends. Ooh. He should take it easy does not mean go hunting. Well, I hope it was worth it. Done. Can I show him? I hope you like it. Is that a yes? Yes. Yeah. He could stay on the island. Have a word? - Is this about Haku? - It's not. - In private? - There's no one on this island more qualified to deal with a problem than my wife. This pilot, we need to be careful. He could be a spy. I know that your sheep-rearing techniques have been productive, Hawila, but I'm not sure word has spread to Japan. This isn't funny. I agree. Then what's your plan here. When Aylmer arrives, we take him to the big island, maybe get him home. - But we don't even know-- - I wasn't asking. - This is our land and we need to protect-- - He's here now, and he'll be treated for what he is, a guest. No way. Absolutely not. You're the best swimmer on the island. - There is no one else to ask. - I told you, I don't wanna be involved in this. - You are Japanese. - Exactly. You're a Nisei born in Hawaii, and I'm Japanese, and that's exactly why I don't wanna be involved in this 'cause I can't risk my life here. If that beacon is on and the Japanese turn up, what do you think is going to happen? They're aren't gonna grab Shigenori and leave. This is the only way no one gets hurt, Matsu. If we don't, it'll be worse, much worse for everyone. Including you. What do you want me to do? Once we confirm the Japanese aren't coming and the island is safe, we'll get him on a boat. Then we can put this whole thing behind us. Here, my friends. Ella tells me you went out with Shigenori today. He spoke to me. He spoke to you? In English. You never said that. What did he say? Not much. He's a good hunter. He'll start with me fishing detail, tomorrow. Earn his keep. That's nice. Did you make it? A friend? Cheer up, I'm sure you'll see him soon. No. I watched him die. What did you find out? It's a simple distress beacon. I know how it works. It wasn't flashing. It wasn't emitting any information. - Then they don't know he's here. - And they aren't coming. - Do we tell him? - No, let him think they are. It buys us time to get him off the island. He won't leave without his papers. His papers, they weren't there. - Then where are they? - I don't know. It could've fallen out on impact. It could be at the bottom of the ocean or-- Or? Hawila, I think he may have gone down there. Could he have made that swim? - In daylight, yes. - Okay then, if Hawila has them, - we need to get them back. - There is no we. The beacon has not been triggered. The island is safe. I'm done! What about Hawila? Matsu! What about Hawila? You spoke of tradition. Here on Niihau, everyone contributes to each other's materials. Of each catch, each kill, everyone plays a part. Lures are passed down through generations. This was given to me by the man who raised me, the man who made me who I am today. I want you to have it. What? Pitiful. Oh, all right, well thanks for the support, guys. I've only been at this for two days. Ha! It's your technique. I watch, your style, very poor, very bad. Okay, okay, very poor, very bad. Okay, I get it. Think you can do better. Thank you. A friend gave me this. Now I... give it to a friend. You went to the crash site. I know you have his papers. I need them back. - You need them? - I have a little over $40 here, 42 to be exact. It's all yours for the papers. No. - Don't you get it? I don't have any-- - I don't want money. Then what do you want? I wanna know why he's here. And I want you to get off my farm. There will be trouble if the papers aren't returned. I said, get off my farm. He won't sell them, but he has them, he has them! He said that. He didn't have to. Aylmer arrives tomorrow, tomorrow. Then we've run out of time, I'm sorry. There's nothing else we can do. Maybe you can talk to him before anybody else gets a chance, - make him see sense, tell him that-- - Are you in? He'll listen to you. Convince him to take Shigenori back with him to the authorities. We just need him off the island. And how do you know that's any better than staying here for him or for us? I don't. Why are you so important? It's late. I swam to the plane. Hawila. What am I looking at? I don't know. They make no sense to me. Found them in the cockpit. I also found this. Yoshio offered me money for these tonight. - Why would he do that? - I don't know, but I'm telling you, something isn't right. You really think he just falls from the sky, - lands in our lap? - What are you saying? I said it before, maybe he's a spy. - Think about it. He drops in. - He didn't drop in. I know this because I pulled him from the wreckage myself. He's not a spy. You don't think this is suspicious? This is a service weapon, okay? And you said yourself, these make no sense. Look, why don't you take him to Matsu. No, no, no, he could be in on it. Something's going on. Then take these papers and the weapon, and don't let them out of your sight. So what, that's it? - I'm going to bed, let it go. - But Ben. Get some rest. You don't seem yourself. You haven't in a few days now. Is everything okay? I'm fine. Really. I don't know about you girls, but I may have overdone it with the inu last night. It doesn't take much to overdo it on the Okolehao especially with Haku's hands on it. That's true. A few painkillers will set you right. I don't think I should be using the painkillers on my self-inflicted headache given the news. What news? What's wrong? I know a lot of you are worried about Aylmer. Yes, he's been delayed, but we have enough food to last until next week. We'll be fine. What if it takes longer than a week? Then we hunt more food. But we need supplies. Not imminently, we don't. What if something's happened to him? I'm sure he's fine. We should try and contact Kauai. And how do we do that? I don't know, with, with flashlights from the peak? The lights will never reach. I don't hear you coming up with any ideas. It can be done! Not with flashlights and not at the peak, but at nightfall, we could bring kerosene from Paniau. We could maybe signal Kauai if I can find a reflector of sorts. Find a reflector. Haku will organize some kerosene with you. We give Aylmer one more day. Until then, we go on as normal. What was that? I know what you said, but we need more medical supplies. Our rations were already low, and we used most of them on Shigenori. - This can't wait? - There are those who can wait and those who can't.. Aylmer may arrive tomorrow. Or he may not. What do you suggest we do? Contact him, walk away. Matsu's already going to use kerosene-- And how long will that take, Ben? We need to act quicker. With what? We have no telephones, we have no way of contacting him. What if there was? There may be an unused radio in with all the other junk. - May? - Yeah, I haven't seen it in a while, and I don't know if it's still working, but it's worth a shot. Find it. I'll help. See? Hey, what about Shigenori? What about him? - Maybe we can get on his plane-- - No, the plane is gone. That's not an option. Okay. I'm just trying to help, you know? I'm an ideas man. You know, that's why I need you. Or Ben or Matsu, you know? It's to keep me right. You don't honestly believe a disused radio will work, do you? I don't know, that's why I'm looking for it, which is what you should be doin'. I was, I've checked all that side. Then let's switch. Double check, no room for errors. Come on, Kumu, this is what you taught me, you know? But yeah, I do, you know? If we can contact Kauai and Aylmer, we can find out what's going on, and if nothing else, we just let them know we need more supplies. That's if we find it. If? Yahoo! Yeah! Done. See, I know you'd get it working, man. That's why you help Aylmer. You know this stuff. We'll see. Indeed, one hour after Japanese air squadrons had commenced bombing in the island of Oahu, the Japanese ambassador to the United States delivered a formal reply to a recent American message. And while this reply stated that it seemed useless to continue the existing diplomatic negotiations, it contained no threat or hint of war or of armed attack. It will be recorded that the distance of Hawaii from Japan makes it obvious that the attack was deliberately planned many days or even weeks ago. - December 7th, 1941... - Ben, wait! ...a date which will live in infamy. They know, you must leave now! No! Ben-- You couldn't have known, no one could, no one did. What are you doing? You were supposed to be watching him! You heard what he did, he's got this coming to him! That's not your call to make! And whose is it, yours? Why is it okay for you to strike him? - I was angry. - So are we! No one touches him, no one. Heard about Aka. I'm not discussing this with you. People are angry, Ben, and we can't hold him in there forever. We can until help arrives. Who, Aylmer? We take shifts, watch him. Tonight Izzy, tomorrow Haku, and so on. And what about them? - When Aylmer arrives-- - Aylmer's not coming! Keep your voice down. For all we know, he's dead. I said, keep your voice down. They knew, Ben, they knew. Shigenori could have lied to them, just as he lied to us, to me. That's not true. - You don't know that. - I know more than you! I told you something was off, didn't I? - But no, you wouldn't listen. - That's enough, Hawila! The people need to know who's making our decisions for us. If you've been wrong about everything else, what makes you think you're the man to lead us now? And you are? I could be. My name is Ben Kanahele. Its protector. Following John Reaney by decree of Aylmer Robinson. If anyone here sees fit that I relinquish that title, then use your voice now! If anyone thinks they can handle the situation better than I, speak now! If anyone here thinks that the best interests of this island do not beat with the blood of my heart, then speak now! We keep the prisoner until Aylmer arrives. He'll be detained in the guest hut. Tonight, Izzy will guard him, Hawila, you watch the beach at daybreak. And you? I'll man the radio. Did he say much? No. Just stared at a photograph all night. ...in Midway. It has therefore undertaken... How are you holding up? ...offensive except... - No news. - ...extending throughout the Pacific area. Well, that is not what I asked. The facts of yesterday and today speak for themselves. I don't know what to tell these people, Ella. The people of the United States have already formed their opinions and well understand the implications to the very life and safety of our nation. They don't need words, Ben. As Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, - I have directed that all measures be taken... - They know you'll do - what's best for the island. - ...for our defense. But always will our whole nation remember the character of the armed force against them. What do you need? I just need you to tell me that you love me, and I know I'll be okay. I'll leave you two alone. ...that we will not only defend ourselves to the uttermost, but will make it very certain that this form of treachery shall never again endanger us. What do you want? Leniency for Shigenori. How about leniency for the men across the water who died on Sunday. You don't know how involved he was. We know enough. Blinking at the fact... 24 hours ago, - ...that our people... - he was a friend - of the island. - ...our territory - And our interests. - Of yours. Because he lied to us! He didn't have a choice. Look how we're reacted. In our armed forces, - with the unbounding... - We wait until tomorrow. ...determination of our people. Aylmer can take him back to Kauai. If Aylmer doesn't arrive? Then I'll take him myself! To Kauai? That's crazy! If it's what I need to do. And then what? What do you think they'll do to him? Whatever they see fit. It's not up to me, or to us, to punish him or to show leniency. I'm done talking about this, Yoshio. 1941, a state of war has existed between the United States and the Japanese Empire. What, uh-- what are you doing? Aylmer's no show is a lifeline. They aren't gonna let Shigenori just leave. Not for Shigenori, for us. For us? You still don't get it, Yoshio? Look at what our so-called friends have already done to Shigenori. They think of us as more Japanese than Hawaiian. Our skin is a little different, our voice is a little off. They don't see our person, they see our heritage, which make us as their enemy. Do you honestly think everything will go back to normal? It's only a matter of time and it will only get worse. We need to leave! And go where? Let's just hope Shigenori knows where his submarine is. I thought you'd be hungry. See, this I why I love you. Well, I was hoping it'd be more than that. How long are you here? A few more hours. And then? Then we change it up. I meant for you. I don't know. Why, what do you suggest? I suggest you come to the medical hut. And why would I wanna go to the medical hut? - Yeah? - Hmm. How is he? Argh! Who knows? He hasn't said a word, he just sits there and stares at his photograph. Poor guy. It is what it is. He's in there all alone, no one to talk to, nothing to pass the time. He's being kept locked up, it's not supposed to be fun. I mean, like I said, maybe it is what it is. Hey come on, give me a smile. Come on. I got to go. Hey, wait. - Tell me. - You don't deserve it. I know I don't, but tell me anyway. I love you, Haku. I love you too. Seriously, I got to go. See you later? I'll be right here, counting down the minutes. It's late now again, why are you guys here? He hasn't eaten. Unless you'll share that. Five minutes. Thanks Haku. Go ahead, Honolulu. And several planes have been shot down, and anti-aircraft gunnery is very heavy. All lines of communication seem to be down between the various Army posts. Everyone here on the Islands were taken by surprise by the attack. You look tired, go home, get some rest. Air raid on these beautiful islands actually happened. I'm not asking. - Go. - After the attack on Pearl Harbor. I can pick this up for now. Planes came in from the south dropping bombs and incendiary bombs over the city. One bomb hit a local factory. Calm down. Hey, hey, hey, okay, you guys are done, okay? No, no, no, no, no, we already have it. No, no, no, no, no, Haku! I gave you five minutes to talk him, and look what happened. No, he tried to kill us, I'm surprised you guys--. - No, Shigenori! - No, no, no! Oh my, oh my god. Haku. Haku! Haku. What have you done? Haku. He's right. We have to go. We killed him, we killed him, we killed Haku! I'm sorry too, but we have to go. Go where? We can't leave him here. Be quiet. They're not here. Shigenori, he's gone. I'll get supplies and meet you both by the chapel. The Army and Navy went on a war basis on the Pacific seaboard today. All leaves were cancelled, all furloughs revoked, and every man was ordered to report to his station. The commandants of the three Naval districts on the West Coast appealed by every medium for every officer and man to report to his post. The commander of marshalled defensive forces... Ella, Ella! - Get off me! - Come down, Ella. Matsu. Before you say it, the reflector didn't work. Shigenori is hurt. Hurt, what happened? He was shot by Hawila, we need your help. Whoa, whoa, whoa, start again. Hawila shot him? I told you I don't want to be a part of this. You're already part of this, Matsu, we all are. What do you want from me? I already helped you. I made sure the island was safe. Besides, I never asked for any of this. I just want it to go away, for it all to go away and just let me and the island get back to how it was. - That's all I want! - Then help us get off the island tonight before Hawila can raise the alarm. - Us? - It's okay for you. They don't think you knew about Shigenori. You can go back to normality after all this, as long as they don't know you helped him. - Are you threatening me now? - I don't need to threaten you. You're Japanese. How do you think this plays out for you if they think you're implicated? You want everything to go back to normal? The only way that happens is if we leave the island. - Who else knows about it? - Only Hawila. He tore off into the forest heading west towards the peak. He'll be circling back to the village. We don't have much time. Is everything okay? Shigenori's hurt, we need your help. Shigenori? Where's Haku? Irene, where's Haku? Stay there, Lani. What are you doing, Irene? Get some bandages, Matsu. No! You need to come with us. Irene, this is not what you want to do, okay? Just get some bandages, Matsu! Yoshio, what are you thinking, hmm? Please be quiet. Well, what are you gonna do when everyone finds out about this? When Ben finds out? As I said, be quiet. - What's going on? - I was right, I was right all along. The, the-- They came for me, but I shot him. I shot him and escaped. - Shot who? - Shigenori. We need to get everyone out of the village. Leave it to me. You can take 'em to my family's burial cairn. They'll be safe there. Okay, come on. Hawila. You said they came for you. Who is they? Yoshio and Irene. Why you? For these. Come with me. Someone else has the same idea. - You're not going to Kauai. - It's the only way. A rowboat? That'll take hours. I'm not saying it will be easy. No, it's too dangerous. It's what needs to be done. I'll go. I made the trip before, I know the Kaulakahi Channel. I wanna help the island, this is my chance. I'll take the papers to Kauai and bring back help. Let me do it. Let me do it. You sure you'll be okay? What are you gonna do? I'm going to find my wife. Yoshio. You can stop this, let me go. It's gone too far. Nothing has happened yet. Ella. - What is she doing here? - She saw us. It's okay, we'll be fine. Haku. Lani, I'm sorry. No, no, I won't help him. Don't you touch her! - No, no! - Are you crazy? I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it! It's okay, I'll do it. Shigenori, please sit down. Please, Shigenori, sit down. It's okay. We need to find Hawila. What? No. Shigenori will kill everyone in the village, starting with all of us if we don't. Then you do it. We're not asking, Matsu. Find Ben, tell him Ella is here. - You know he'll go crazy when he finds out-- - He'll find Hawila. Do it! - Where is Ben? - That depends. On what? On whether he's looking for me or whether he's looking for you. State of emergency... - Yoshio and Irene are-- - I know. I know. I didn't mean for this to happen! I'm sorry, Ben. Where are they? Where is Ella? Why are you doing this to us? You're one of us. You don't understand, you can't. It's complicated. Maybe you were too blind to see what was coming. I'm not. - We would've protected you. - Like you protected him. - That was different. - Was it? You saw how fast the village turned, locked up like an animal, attacked. We'd have been next. As you said, you can't understand. But I did what I did for the island. You tell that to Lani. You tell that to Haku. It was one thing and then another. It got out of hand. Are you okay? Yes. What do you want? You know what I want. Then go. We won't stop you. We need his documents. Hawila have them. He ran off. Find him and bring him back him back to us. Once we get the papers, we can leave the island. This doesn't have to be this way. There's nothing here for us now. Who says I know where Hawila is? You know this island better than anyone. You'll be able to find him. And if I say no? Then everyone on this island will die! It's okay. You once spoke of being a warrior who wanted peace. Better to be a warrior in a garden, than a gardener in a war. This is your last chance. Yes, it is. It's the only way. Find Hawila, no one else needs to get hurt. I love you. We need to think about options, about leaving. You heard him. I'm not talking about him. Where is it? It's gone. Gone, gone where? It can't just go! It didn't. Hawila. Let her go! No, no, no, no, no! Here, Matsu! Matsu! Irene, no! Irene, no! Ah! Ben! I didn't mean for this to happen. Matsu! Ben! Don't do this. You don't have to. Do it! Ben! No, no! No. - I don't want to die. - You're not going to die, I'm not gonna let you die. I'm not gonna let you die. I didn't mean for this to happen. I was trying to help. We were trying to help.

Yoshio, put the gun down. - This is my fate. - No! - But it needn't be yours! - No! Here! We're over here! We're over here. It's Aylmer. Is everybody all right? No! Why are you taking him, why are you taking him? He didn't do anything! Matsu. Matsu! ¶ A fond embrace ¶ ¶ Until we meet again ¶ ¶ A fond embrace ¶ ¶ Until we meet again ¶ ¶ Until we meet again ¶
