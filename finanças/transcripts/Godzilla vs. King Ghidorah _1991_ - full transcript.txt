That's it? Yes, that's King Ghidorah. It's gigantic, and it's got two heads. Well, originally it had three. Three? He lost one when he fought Godzilla. You mean King Ghidorah fought Godzilla? Yes, in the 20th century. UFO presence in Tokyo? Was the Mysterious Light a UFO? Are you awake? Yeah. For a while. Did you see the UFO last night? No, I went to bed early. Though I did manage to read through the paper this morning. Looks like it was real this time. Even for the skeptical press, they can't seem to explain it otherwise. I guess you're right. This story is going to be in our next issue. Will you write something for us? Hey, go ask Yaoi. I told you I'm fed up writing about mainstream opinions. I've changed my ways and from this point on, I'll only write non-fiction, human-based topics. That's funny, coming from someone who wrote a book about psychics. Be quiet. I'll tell you what. I'm interested in that old man that lives in Hakata. Where? That article about Dinosaur World. Man objects to dinosaur exhibit at Fukuoka Dinosaur World A long time ago, I saw a real-life dinosaur. You don't know what it was like, but I certainly do! That dinosaur is always watching us from somewhere. And if we ever become helpless and desperate... Right when we're about to be broken, the dinosaur will always come. A warning to the humans who desecrate the dinosaur The dinosaurs are sacred Hear the voice of the dinosaur I encountered it on the doomed battlefront of the War. So, now, is our country safe? Our country seems peaceful, and you think nothing could possibly happen to us. - But we've lost our will to live. - Let's go. You're disturbing the peace. - Come on. - What are you doing? Listen to your heart! Lagos Island? That's right. It's a small island between two larger islands called Luol and Kwajalein, in the South Pacific. You saw a living dinosaur on that island, huh? When our troops were stationed over on Lagos Island, a lot of the soldiers in my garrison saw it. It protected us. It saved us from the U.S. forces that were attacking our troops in that region. It protected you? It was February, 1944. The Luol and Kwajalein garrisons were all under heavy attack from the American Navy, and they were completely annihilated. But only our garrison on the small island of Lagos survived. So what you're saying is that the dinosaur repelled the Americans? Yeah, that's right. Unbelievable. But Why? Why did it do that? I think perhaps it wasn't really protecting us, but that it was only trying to protect its own territory. The dinosaur was very gentle at first. But later, it went completely wild. It went wild? The Americans were so scared with what they saw, they retreated with their tails between their legs. Later, the High Command saw that we hadn't surrendered and gave orders to evacuate us in a hurry. We thought we would never see our homeland ever again. But thanks to that dinosaur, we were able to return to Japan. But there's no one who... Well, is there a record of what happened in Lagos? No, there isn't. Every one of the other garrisons fought to the death. Yet we were on this small island that was close by. How could the surviving soldiers leave a record about coming back? The S.S. Takatsuki had recorded with its radar, this flight path of the UFO from last night. The UFO then disappeared from radar detection as it passed over Mount Fuji. As it traveled southwest, its movements were clearly recorded. This is the first time our radar systems have been able to trace the entire path of the UFO. Now, take a look at this. We can tell from looking at these satellite pictures that it was neither an aircraft nor a meteorite. A UFO? That is, there's just no other explanation. There is yet another interesting report from the Paranormal Research Center. This is from Miki Saegusa of the Godzilla team. This is Saegusa. There's something I'd like to show you in the satellite photographs. Please watch your screen carefully. This image here is where Godzilla rests in the Sea of Japan, driven there by Biollante. That is where he's been lying all this time. All of these years, he's been kept alive and unabated by anti-nuclear bacteria. But just yesterday, we found something new, here in the latest satellite photo. - What is that? - They've become a singular body. - A singular body. - This is news. We analyzed the image very closely. It's the same UFO that flew in yesterday. What does that mean? Are you saying that the UFO and Godzilla are related somehow? No, we still don't know what that object is yet. So we can't conclude anything. Department of Engineering Science Research Center Those bones that were caught by the Japanese fishing boat look to me like they are from a Plesiosaur. A Loch Ness in the South Pacific? A Plesiosaur just off of New Zealand in 1977? All scientists say dinosaurs are extinct, but I don't agree. Doubts on the extinction of dinosaurs So what you're saying is... I would believe that old man's story. That thing may not have been a Tyrannosaurus rex, but in 1944, there was a dinosaur on the Marshall Islands. If it's true that there was a dinosaur, does that mean you'll go to the island of Lagos to try to find it? No, I won't go because in my opinion, it's not there anymore. Not there anymore? Well, then, what are you going to do? Hydrogen bomb test site at Marshall Islands The H-bomb tests? Tested on Lagos in 1954. So the dinosaur was hit by massive radioactivity. And after that, the dinosaur turned into Godzilla. What's that? Unit two, copy that. What is that? Move in closer, we'll check it out. Yes, sir. What happened, Unit two? Respond! We've just arrived at the scene. We'll start investigating right away. Hey, what's that? What? What do you see? Two army helicopters on a routine patrol disappeared without a trace near Mount Fuji last night. And some say it could have been the unexplained UFO that was responsible for the disappearance and possible destruction of the army helicopters. We have here Mr. Yaoi, a UFO expert, to speak with us. Thank you for coming, Mr. Yaoi. Please tell us what you think. Good morning. Well, there have been many instances where army aircraft have disappeared upon approaching UFOs. For example, on November 16, 1988... I hope you don't want me to write about some space battle now, huh? What's that? Yasuaki Shindo? Of course I know him. He's the head of the Teiyo Group. Besides that, he's the man who owns Dinosaur World. So what about him? He was on Lagos? Yes, he was Major Shindo back then, commander of the Lagos garrison. So, then, Mr. Shindo would know about the dinosaur as well. What, a real dinosaur? Young man, I do call myself an expert in dinosaur studies, but I'm sorry to tell you I've never seen a live one. Are you saying not even on Lagos Island? On Lagos? I believe that there was a dinosaur on Lagos Island in 1944. Mr. Shindo. I have to go to Kyushu for a meeting right now. I've wasted my precious time here. Ten years ago, after you left Lagos, an H-bomb was tested on a nearby island called Bikini. And it's very possible that the radioactivity turned it into Godzilla. That's what I believe, anyway. You mean that the dinosaur turned into Godzilla? Its head is smaller than that of a Tyrannosaurus rex. Look closely at the face. The eyes and mouth. Also the hands and fingers. So rather than a Tyrannosaurus... Rather, its characteristics are close to Godzilla. And these pictures here belong to Shindo? That's right. No one besides the three of us has ever seen the pictures. So then it was the dinosaur that saved the very men who rebuilt our economy and country. We've come to Japan to talk. Your weapons are futile. Our first meeting will be today at 13:00. Is this message from them? Yes, we received it around 10:00 a.m. It suddenly appeared on this monitor. Do you think they will show themselves? Something's happening with the UFO. Move out! Come on! Move it! Move it! My name is Dobashi. I'm head of the Security Agency. I'm Fujio. I'm a physicist at the Paranormal Research Center. I'm Wilson. It's nice to meet you. I'm Glenchico. Emmy Kano. I'm Japanese. Please forgive us, we can't shake hands. Why is that? Because we're still inside the ship. What you see is a hologram projection of us. A hologram? That's correct. We're a 3D projection, invented in the 21st century. The 21st century? We've traveled back in time from the 23rd century. 2204, if you wish to be exact. We are from the Earth Union. So the UFO is... Men of your time would call our ship a time machine. But not us, we call it our mother ship. So this ship is a time machine? Yes, it was invented 200 years from now. Near the beginning of the 22nd century. How is that possible? I understand. You're from the 23rd century. So then what do you want? First off, tomorrow morning, we'd like to have a meeting with your country's Prime Minister, and we hope that you two will help arrange it for us. Yes, we will. But tell me, how would you want us to take the three of you to him? Please, sir, just tell us where your Prime Minister will be, we assure you we'll show up at that place. Teleportation. They are clearly not from the 20th century. Using the Earth Union's time machine, we've been sent back here to warn you all. We wish to change incidents that are about to take place here. Things that have caused catatastrophy in the 23rd century. We came here to warn you all about your country's gloomy future. In the century that we come from, there's no longer a Japan. How could that possibly be, and why? What's the reason for it? It's all a result of nuclear pollution. In the 21st century, Godzilla will return to Japan and bring forth its demise. Of course, the land will be destroyed, but the destruction will cause radiation to spread. And over time, the radiation will spread over the entire country and your mother country will be totally uninhabitable. Can it be true? Would Godzilla do that to us? It's unbelievable. We have come here to save Japan from the terrible tragedy it now faces. Save us? How do you plan on saving us? You must obliterate Godzilla. Get rid of Godzilla? We can't do that. - Impossible. - Yeah. I have a book here. Finally, I'm done! Hello, this is Terasawa. Yeah. That's right. I'm a writer of non-fiction stories. Who's calling? This is the Security Agency? Now? The Prime Minister's Office now? - They've asked you here, too? - That's right. I'm sorry to have invited you gentlemen here so late. Come, please follow me. The Birth of Godzilla But this is the book that I wrote. I mean, it's the book that I'm writing right now. And it includes an introduction by Professor Fujio. Yes, that seems to be the case. But... How is it possible that you have a book that I'm about to write? You said that people from the distant future brought this book? That's right. I find this very hard to believe. Now, according to that book, Godzilla is a dinosaur that's existed since 1944 on Lagos Island. It was exposed to radiation from the H-bomb test in 1954 in the Bikini Atoll. Which caused the dinosaur to be enlarged and enraged. They examined him in the sea, where he is presently. They've checked bones and cells and entered this data into their computers to check it against your theory. So, how does my theory hold up? There's a 98% chance that all the facts are as you predicted. So that means, if the dinosaur hadn't been exposed to radiation from the H-bomb test, then Godzilla would not exist. Yes, that's what they told us. Furthermore, Japan will be free from the threat of Godzilla's wrath. You don't mean... They're going back in time? They intend to use their time machine and go back to 1944 at Lagos Island. There, they will teleport the dinosaur to another location. Our history will no longer include Godzilla. That was the request of the men from the future. It's fantastic. Oh, no. Don't be surprised yet. They've come to us in search of people who will help them complete their task. They have chosen three people. Terasawa, the writer of the book. Mazaki, the dinosaur expert. And Miki Saegusa, a member of the Paranormal Research Center. Advance to the center of the platform. Turn left and proceed. This way. Please be seated. Sit down, please. We thank you and the Japanese government for helping us with our task. We thank the three people who will be joining us as well. From our own people, fellow Japanese Miss Emmy and our Android model M-11 will be with you. He's an android? You mean this guy is a robot? I am. But he looks just like a man! Yes, externally, but actually he's much better. His defensive ability, for example, is far superior. He's much more capable than any human being could possibly be. For this mission, the details, security, everything will be guaranteed if he is with you. But there are other people besides the three of us here who know much more about the dinosaur. Actually, there are some who've even seen a dinosaur face-to-face and have even lived to tell about it. So why did you choose the three of us here? The theory in time warp, contrary to how it is in films, is that two instances of a person cannot exist at the same moment in time. Therefore, if we send Mr. Shindo back to the future, one of him from 50 years ago and the other from our present time would exist at the same time. Therefore, one of the Mr. Shindos will disappear. That's exactly right. You mean I have to ride that? Couldn't they pick somebody else? Hey, Emmy, I have a question about the future. What is it? Well, tell me now, did my book become a bestseller? Actually, hardly anyone even knew about your book. I see. Sorry, did they scare you? We call them dorats. They're so cute. We will be leaving shortly. Crew members, please get to your stations immediately. They're a new kind of animal. They're created through biotechnology. They're achievements of the 23rd century. They always know how to behave around people. They can sense our feelings through microwave impulses. Will they be coming along with us? Yes, they will be very helpful to us if we ever get lost because they can always cheer us up. Well, I sure hope that doesn't happen to us this time. I'm joking. Prepare for takeoff. Have we arrived? A complete success. It's the 6th of February, 1944, Lagos Island. Really? It looks like we really did travel back in time. It seems we're right in the middle of World War ll in the South Pacific. I've lost contact. Just went dead. Right. We've just lost contact with them, sir. Thank you, soldier. Commander. Are we all right here? These bombs from the 20th century can't hurt our ship. Emmy, I'll go and check things outside. That's crazy. There's a war going on out there. M-11 won't be hurt by those old bombs. In Kwajalein and Luol islands, all 6,600 of our brave soldiers fought valiantly. They fought to the very last man without giving up. They will go down in Japanese history as the true defenders of the motherland. Tomorrow, at dawn, we are going to launch our final, all-out attack. Zoom. You all know that the Americans greatly outnumber us. But that does not matter. Even up to the last moment each of us has, we still have to believe in our final victory over the enemy. That's Mr. Shindo. He's younger, all right, but it's him. Amazing. Persevere! Our deaths will be the flesh and blood of an even greater and much stronger Japan! Charge! A dinosaur? Amazing. It's incredible. I can't believe it. I can't believe it. Let's disembark. Commander? That's Godzilla. I'm sure of it! Right, then. It's confirmed that it's Godzilla. Our job now is to teleport it away. Let's go to the day the Japanese soldiers evacuate. Attention! We deeply regret that we must leave our savior behind. Though we weren't able to seize this island, please forgive us. There is nothing that we can do. We can't mend your wounds. We cannot take you to safety. We hope your wounds heal quickly and that you will recover to full health. We, the Lagos garrison of the Japanese army, will never forget how you saved our lives! Never. Commander, the boat's leaving. Present arms! Rest! We march home with honor. Right face! Forward march! They all thought that the dinosaur was going to die here on the island. To think that in 15 years, it would resurrect and return as Godzilla. It might've been much happier if it were just left here all alone to die on this island. Come on now. History has no room for sentimentality. Come, let's get back and finish up our work. Lucky for us, the dinosaur is immobile. That makes it easy. Usually animals are very difficult when they are awake. Because of this, a thorough teleportation is possible. Teleportation, start. We did it. Great! Where are the dorats? M-11, time warp. - How was it? How did it go? - We hardly did a thing. M-11 and Emmy did all the work. We had the most wonderful experience. How did the teleportation go? - A success. - Good. What about Godzilla now? He's gone. Fujio was in contact with us. The Japanese naval observation post sent a report right away. So Godzilla's gone from history forever. Everything has gone just as planned. So far. So far? Is there something you haven't told us about? Godzilla has disappeared, and now King Ghidorah has taken his place. King Ghidorah? Godzilla suddenly disappeared from the Sea of Japan. At the same time, King Ghidorah has appeared over the Pacific Ocean. At the same time? - Is there a connection between the two? - We don't know anything yet. It is confirmed that King Ghidorah is already heading for Japan. We're in more danger than ever before. Fujio! King Ghidorah has already reached Kyushu. Look out, sir! King Ghidorah is presently attacking Fukuoka. A state of emergency has been issued. Everyone must calmly evacuate. Do not remain inside buildings. Get to an underground shelter if possible. Do not drive in your vehicles. This is an emergency. Fukuoka is being attacked by King Ghidorah. Are you hurt? No. My city is destroyed. You won't get away with this, you damn monster! The dorats? You mean that instead of the dinosaur, they were exposed to the radiation from the H-bomb test in 1954? So those cute little animals are now gigantic and savage? It's possible that Emmy intentionally left the dorats there to be exposed to radioactivity. It's possible that after they were exposed, the three dorats merged into one and turned into a giant monster. So, if what both of you are saying is true, King Ghidorah was created by these people from future. More importantly, why would these people create King Ghidorah and destroy Japan? The computer was right. The three dorats you took to the island of Lagos turned into a monster even more powerful than Godzilla. Nobody told me we were the ones who would create King Ghidorah. The real issue was to see if we could control it, like we control the dorats. It looks like we will be able to manipulate it. Right, M-11? Kyushu is finished. Next, we move north. North? Destroy Hokkaido. What do you want? To destroy all of Japan? All except Tokyo. Then we'll show the Japanese the proper way to rebuild their country. We can't! My dear, I hope that after you've seen your country being destroyed, you haven't forgotten what our mission is. We came here to warn the people of the 20th century. This is pretty much terrorism. You've gone too far. Where have you been? I've been looking for you. I have good news. We'll publish your Godzilla story. How about we call it The Birth of Godzilla? Let's get together and talk about it. I'm sure it'll be a big seller. And if it is, how about thinking of marriage? Call me back soon. I already know the title and even the date. I even know how it sold. Maybe the title Traveling in Time would make it a bestseller. That would be against the rules. The Equal Environment Earth Union? Its sole purpose is to equalize the power of all nations on Earth. All types of people joined our organization. Modest people such as myself, and some of them radical. We used the time machine to carry out the plan we had for Japan. But why? Actually, Godzilla didn't show up until the 23rd century. So then, what about the nuclear pollution that destroys Japan? It's all a lie. Later on, Japan will become even stronger and be the richest nation of the 21st century. With all this wealth and great power, it'll buy up nations. South America and Africa. And then in the 22nd century, Japan will be bigger than China, America and all of Europe. No nation will compare to it. So what you're saying is that they've come here to destroy Japan before all that happens. Why did they have to come back and destroy Japan in this way? There's no other way. At the end of the 20th century, all nuclear weapons are banned. Because of that, no organization or government can control Japan, not even the Earth Union. So Wilson came up with his own plan. Create a monster worse than Godzilla, let it destroy 20th century Japan, and cease the global domination. Use and install our computer into your government system We are vulnerable to the will of the people from the future. We will end up as puppets. It makes me believe that this is their real purpose for coming to our era. If we refuse all of their help, King Ghidorah will destroy the whole country. Our armed forces can't stop the monster. Mr. Mazaki... That dinosaur buried in the ocean. Do you think we could somehow change it into Godzilla? Well, biological science aside, based on experience, it can be asserted that both King Ghidorah and Godzilla were born from nuclear tests at the Bikini Atoll. However, Japan does not hold any nuclear force to speak of. The Teiyo Group has a submarine with nuclear capabilities. Don't worry. Of course, we haven't kept the submarine in Japanese waters. She's in a South Pacific region not too far away from us. Your enterprise possesses such a thing? The submarine does not have nuclear weapons on board, as it is not intended to be used for military means. The submarine is only for defending Japan if there was a threat. So, you plan to use missiles to hit the dinosaur in the sea and hope that it will turn itself into Godzilla? Outrageous! How dare we use nuclear weapons just to create another Godzilla? Well, what other alternatives do we have to destroy King Ghidorah? I'm afraid you don't understand. Godzilla was my savior. You say that you can feel Godzilla? Yes, whenever I close my eyes, I see him in flashes, as though he is walking through ice. It feels exactly the way I felt it before in Mihara-yama. It can't be. You know that Godzilla is no longer with us. The one buried under the Bering Sea is just a dinosaur. It could be possible. Maybe there's nuclear energy there. Maybe there's sunken battleships with nuclear missiles. Or there could be nuclear waste there. Is that possible? NUCLEAR SUB SINKS IN THE BERING SEA This is it! The claim that the nuclear material was salvaged was obviously a lie. Are you going home already? And after he asks me to help him. You can at least tell me what you're doing. It's for The Birth of Godzilla, of course. Right. So, you think that Godzilla has been revived? Well, I don't have any proof yet... Well, this is something I'd like to tell those government fools who want to create a new Godzilla with their nuclear weapons. Whether it's true or not. The Teiyo Group grew into a mega power in the 23rd century. They are untouchable. There's news of Godzilla. He's moving. This is a heat-sensitive satellite photograph. And an enlargement of Godzilla in the Bering Sea. Where are you going? I'm going to talk with Mr. Shindo. That there's no need to create another Godzilla. I'm going with you. Let's get away! Go away! I'm going to fall. Whoa! Watch out! No way! He's lifting my cherished car. Stop that! What is he doing, that idiot? No, don't go! You must not go out there! - But Emmy... - He's a robot. This will end if I go back with him. Welcome back. We knew that you left to talk to your Japanese allies. Then why didn't you stop me? Because we wanted to see how the Japanese government would react. We thought you could investigate for us. You people are so evil in your ways. So, are the Japanese planning to resist our operation here? Of course not. The Japanese government is not stupid. They know they can't fight us with our advanced weapons. Just as we thought. I guess I was over-thinking things. Over-thinking? I thought that there might be someone who would think to blast the dinosaur that exists in the Bering Sea with radioactivity and create another Godzilla. We're presently 2.5 miles east of Kamchatka. We're heading southeast for the Bering Sea. Operation G. Roger. So, how are you? What's this? What's going on? Emergency! Emergency! Operation G. What is it? What's happening? What's the matter? Come in! Come in! What's that? It sank? Are you serious? Godzilla sank the sub? Where's Miki right now? And where's Professor Mazaki? I'll go with them now to Okhotsk. On second thought, maybe I can't right now. What's this? This is the computer they want to give to the Japanese government? Look at how that dinosaur changed. Now Godzilla has returned to Japan. Come in, Chitose Air Squadron! King Ghidorah is very close to you, just past Erimo Point. There it is! Commencing attack. Ready! Fire! Fire! Direct hit. Watch out! He's closing in on us. Maneuver to the right. We can't lose him! He's gonna hit us! Pulling away! We're no match for it! Their aircraft are so primitive. It's no challenge. They're just gonna have to give up. They have no choice but to accept all of our demands. What is that? What? Army of Self-Defense Mihoro Station It's even bigger than it was before. Confirming mobilization orders. Scramble orders for 3rd fleet. Scramble 3rd fleet. It's much bigger. If Godzilla was resuscitated with modern nuclear weapons, it's only natural that he's bigger than before. On top of that, he absorbed all of the submarine's energy. So Godzilla was revived. Unlike our age, in the 20th century, there seems to be nuclear power everywhere. It really didn't matter just what location we teleported the dinosaur to. The second birth of Godzilla was an unavoidable event. We went to the trouble of getting rid of one. What a foolish era. There's no reason to save these primitive people. Send our monster to kill Godzilla! It's King Ghidorah. Once again, you fight for us. Go, King Ghidorah! No matter how strong Godzilla becomes, Ghidorah will kill it. As long as we can control King Ghidorah. Come on. Godzilla. Godzilla is losing! King Ghidorah will be victorious. There's a malfunction in the computer room. Soon enough, the time control will automatically start functioning. Emmy? What have you done? You betrayed the union! Forget about giving a computer to Japan! It's been destroyed! What do you mean? Do you think you've won? We don't need a computer or King Ghidorah to do our work! Godzilla is going to destroy the country of Japan himself! Your nuclear fanatics don't know what they've created. This new Godzilla is unfriendly and is going to destroy your country. There's nothing you can do about it! Your country has no future now! Our job here was a success, and soon we'll be back in the 23rd century. There is something you didn't know. Our ship has an advanced safety device. In the event of any emergency, it sends us back to our own time. Twenty minutes after the alarm goes off, it sends us on our way. Time warp in 15 minutes. We'll be returning to our era. You bastard! Emmy! Out of my way, God damn it! Let her go. Let me punch you one more... Emmy! Time warp in 10 minutes. Time warp in 1O minutes. Is it too late? We can't let them go back to their own time and get away with this. Time warp in five minutes. Time warp in five minutes. Start teleportation. We did it! Have we time warped yet? - No, not yet. - Well, where are we, then? Time warp in one minute. Time warp in one minute. It looks like King Ghidorah has been destroyed, but what about Godzilla? He's no longer the dinosaur we knew. It may not be merciful to Mr. Shindo or to Japan. - Naval base to... - Give Asashika... - Confirmed report... - The command... Scramble lsawa forces... I'm afraid this is no longer work for ordinary civilians. Please excuse me. Does this look like the same beast that was once your savior, Mr. Shindo? PARANORMAL SCIENCE RESEARCH CENTER 91%? So it is likely that Godzilla will attack Tokyo? This is an analysis of Godzilla's probable actions. It's calculated from M-11's computer simulation. So it's almost certain that Godzilla will raid Tokyo. Knowing this, Japan will be destroyed just like Wilson said. Godzilla's in Sapporo! Citizens of Sapporo, Godzilla is approaching! Everyone must evacuate! I repeat. Godzilla is approaching! Evacuate immediately! Second squadron deployment complete. Advance vehicles for attack. Offensive engagement! Fire! There's no way we can beat it. We are no match at all for Godzilla. King Ghidorah, who sunk in the ocean? Yeah, that's right. Could you revive him with technology from the 23rd century? Resuscitate him in the 23rd century, and then bring him back to the 20th century? King Ghidorah's hurt very badly. Will he survive until the 23rd century? As long as his cells are still alive. It's possible if preserved in low temperatures. Well? Of course. I shall do it. I exist to do so. Well... Make sure you come back. I surely will. I like this era very much. You're lying. Aren't we primitive? I'm not lying. SO Why? Because there are people like you here. 2204 A.D. THE SEA OF OKHOTSK So King Ghidorah fought with Godzilla? That's right. In the 20th century. It's been 200 years. I don't think he's still alive. I hear him! His heart is beating. Only faintly, but I can hear it. Please resuscitate him. What do you plan on doing with him? We want to restore him back to life. Are you going to turn him into a cyborg? You're going that far for a needy, Far East nation? This is for a deficient nation that drowned in nuclear waste and was destroyed by a monster? Please, give my ancestors another chance. All right, then. I'll let you do it. 1992 A.D. TOKYO Godzilla has just landed at Tokyo Bay. He is heading toward the city. Everyone should evacuate immediately! This is a bad idea, you know. Even journalists are prohibited. Hey, I'm the Peter Arnett of Japan. I'm a reporter that challenges the ordinary. So you're challenging Godzilla? - Don't worry. Come on. - Okay. When will it arrive at Shinjuku? It should arrive in one hour. Chief, evacuation is almost complete. Minister, I'm afraid the destruction is inevitable at this point. This is an unavoidable sacrifice. Yes, however... At this rate, our country will be obliterated. There's a call for you, sir. This is Toguchi. Mr. Shindo? What? Still in Shinjuku? It's heading your way! Yes, I know that. But this is the way that I wanted it. Let me have it my way. My life had long ended on Lagos Island. I was saved by that dinosaur, enabling me to live and establish this country. And the fact that now it is being destroyed by that same dinosaur is so very ironic. Mr. Shindo! Mr. Shindo is in there? So then... ls Shindo dead? Yes. So just what was this dinosaur to him anyway? Emmy“ Was it not possible? All right, Emmy! Here we go, M-11 computer. Ready? Hey, boss. What should we do? What do you think? Run, you fool! Closing in on Godzilla. Emmy, be careful. Get up and run, Emmy! Emmy, what's the matter? Capture equipment ready. Yes, I know that. I did it! Emmy, there's no time to be happy. We aren't able to withstand his rays anymore. We'll be finished. I know that. Emmy“ Thank you very much, Emmy! I'll have to live for 200 years to thank you. Terasawa, there's something I never got the chance to tell you. You're a distant grandfather of mine. Emmy, 1O seconds to time warp. Goodbye, my homeland.
