This is the Inner Sanctum. A strange, fantastic world controlled by a mass of living, pulsating flesh, the mind. It destroys, distorts, creates monsters, commits murder. Yes. Even you, without knowing, can commit murder. That'll be all for today, Tanya. But there's still a good light and I'm not tired. I know. You're never tired. But I have a dinner engagement tonight. - With her? - Yes, with Heather. Now, run along and get changed. She'll be here in a minute. [DOORBELL RINGING] Well, hello, brat. It's about time. - Hello, darling. Am I late? - No, Ijust stopped working. I'm so anxious to see the painting. - Dave, it's wonderful. - Thanks. We're meeting your dad for dinner tonight, aren't we? Darling, why don't we forget this family affair and go someplace together, just us. Oh,no. We couldn't do that. Why, I haven't seen Dad Hayden in weeks. Listen, are you marrying my father or me? Why, your father, of course. With all his dough? David, darling. But after that, I'll do anything you say. Of course, I really should be jealous of your model. - And Dad thinks I should chaperone you - No. But here she is now. Heather, this is Tanya, Miss Czoraki. Dave, she's just as lovely as your painting. How do you do? I must be going, goodbye. Goodbye, Tanya. - Strange little thing, isn't she? - Yes, but an excellent model. She's in love with you. I could tell by the way she looked at us. Nonsense, darling. You're a jealous woman. Well, if she isn't, she ought to be. And maybe I had better chaperone you. Or better yet, marry you right away. Not right away. But just as soon as I finish this painting. I believe it's going to be the best thing I've ever done. It'll make me, professionally. Then I can support a rich man's daughter. Well, I've waited this long, I guess I can wait a little longer. Now, go on and get your clothes on. We're gonna celebrate! [DOORBELL RINGING] - Well, Alan. How are you? - Fine. Fine. Where is she? She hasn't gone yet, has she? Who, Tanya? No, but you almost missed her today. - She'll be out in a minute. - Oh. Dad Hayden told me the news about you and Heather. Congratulations. Thanks. Dave, it's becoming more beautiful every day. It's a wonderful piece of work, almost as fascinating as the original. Thanks, again. She's lovely. Quiet and shy as a child. And yet there's something primitive and passionate about her. She intrigues me. That's quite obvious from the way you've been monopolising her time. Well, after all, I'm a connoisseur of art and beauty. Mostly beauty, I'd say. Oh, but that's not fair. I'm interested in people, too. It's part of my profession to study them. Learn what causes them to act as they do. Oh, so that's why you've been so interested in my model. Yes, it's the mystery of what's going on inside her. For instance, I wonder what she's thinking about now. I wonder. - Tanya, is anything wrong? - Oh, hello, Alan. What's happened? You don't seem very glad to see me. Of course I'm glad to see you. I guess I'm just a little tired. Oh, Dave's a slave driver. Now, as a doctor and a psychiatrist, I prescribe play and relaxation under my personal guidance. We'll have dinner, take in a nightclub... Not tonight, Alan, thank you. I think I should get some rest. Well, then at least I'll see you home. - Same time tomorrow, Tanya. - Yes. Good night. - Good night. So long, Alan. - Goodbye, Dave. A doctor! Quick, get me a doctor! I'm going blind. Sure, I get it. I was good enough to take you out and show you a good time. But now I'm getting the brushoff. Oh, Nick, I'm sorry. I like you. I've always liked you. But now that Dave and I are... Well, our wedding day's practically set. It isn't the thing for us to be running around together. It's your father, he's responsible for this. Oh, I know he doesn't like me. He's had his heart set on you marrying Dave ever since you were just a little kid. And you're only doing it because he wants you to. It so happens that I have a mind of my own and I'm in love with Dave. I've always been in love with him. Oh, but Heather... Dad's right. You really shouldn't call at the house any more. It doesn't look good. No, nothing ever looks good to him. Telephone, Miss Heather. Thank you, Trevers. Yes? An accident? His eyes? - Why don't they let us in to see him? - Now, father... After all, there's nothing to get excited about. It can't be anything really serious. Oh, nothing's ever serious to you. What are you doing here, anyway? This is none of your affair. Nick was with me when we received the news. Oh, I thought you were going to stay away from him now that you've landed a real man. Well, well, what is it? Speak up, Sam. What's the matter? Dave used acid on his eyes instead of eyewash, by mistake. His eyes are badly burned. And I'm afraid the corneas are permanently damaged. - You mean he's blind? - Yes, leukoma. Dad! Can anything be done? Well, I can't say for sure. It's too early to tell. But you've got to do something, man. That boy is like my own son. He's an artist, a painter, he needs his eyes. You're supposed to be one of the best eye men in the country. Do something. I'll do everything I can. When may we see him? Tomorrow. I've given him a sedative and he's asleep now. His mental state will not be good for a while. When I bring him home, someone should be there to greet him. And he shouldn't be left alone for some time. - We'll see to that. - I'll get Alan Bittaker. He'll help. Yes, yes, that's good. He'll know what to do. - Yes, we'll all be there. - No, we won't. It was my fault, my fault. Your fault? I might have known. Yes. I remember moving the bottles. By mistake he must've picked up the wrong one thinking it was the eyewash. - By mistake? I doubt it. You... - I didn't mean to do it. I didn't realise, I didn't know. It was an accident. - HAYDEN: Accident? - Yes. Yes, Dad Hayden, an accident. I was here at the time, there was nothing intentional about it. Please. You must believe me, please. You, you... - Dave. - Heather? - What're you doing here? - You have company. Yes. Dad's here, and Alan and... - Hello, Dave. - Oh, Alan. Did you think I'd need a psychiatrist, coming home like this? Why, nonsense. I'm just on hand as a friend. We thought it'd be better waiting here than all coming to the hospital. Come on, darling. Oh, Dave. - Hello, son. - Dad Hayden. I might have known you'd be here for my homecoming. - Dumb stunt I pulled, wasn't it? - It wasn't your fault. - Welcome home, Dave. - Oh, Tanya. That's fine. Come along, darling. Here we are. Dave, why don't you plan to come home with us for a while? What? What? I'm blind, I know it! Why doesn't someone say something about it? Are you afraid to talk about it? Dave, darling. Of course we know you're blind. And if you wanna talk about it, we will. It's a dirty shame. I'm sorry I went overboard like that. I guess there's no use crying over spilt milk, is there? Forget it, will you? Dave, I don't want to give you any false hope, but there is an operation known as corneal transplant. Oh, Doctor, you mean there's a chance? Yes, there is a chance. But it's a very slim chance. In the first place, the operation is a most delicate eye surgery. And in Dave's case, the injury is so extensive, it's doubtful whether large enough grafts of corneal tissue could be made successfully. You mean you can take the tissue from one set of eyes and graft it onto another? Yes, in the case of the cornea, you can. The cornea is like a window which admits light to the lens of the eye through which it's focused on the retina. And the cornea is the only part of the human eye which can be transplanted from one person to another and retain life. But too large a graft can't be made or the eyeball might collapse. Then at least you can try. Well, it's... It's not as simple as all that. You see, another human eye is needed. One whose cornea is undamaged, from which the necessary grafts may be taken. As you can imagine, such eyes are scarce and difficult to obtain. And an eye removed from a donor must be placed in cold storage immediately and used within 72 hours. Otherwise, the live tissue deteriorates and will not graft. There are organisations such as the Donor Society, where eyes may be obtained for just such an operation. Eyes that were removed because of other defects, though the corneas remained undamaged. Or eyes taken from dead men. Yes, that is true, but the applicants are always more numerous than the supply. And you must furnish the opinion of an eye specialist that the transplant will be a success. As the surgeon, in this case, I'm afraid, I cannot give that as my true opinion. So Dave's application would be delayed indefinitely. Then Doctor, you really mean there isn't any hope? I wouldn't say that, Dave. As a matter of fact... Dr. Welles, would a single eye do? - To take care of both of Dave's? - Yes, yes. Doctor, are you suggesting that someone here donate one of his eyes? I'm suggesting nothing, my son. I'm simply stating the facts. when you can give me no real assurance that this operation would be a success? No, Dave, I am sure you wouldn't. Well, I won't allow it. Not anyone, no matter who. HEATHER: But Dave... DAVE: N0! We'll locate someone who's forced to part with an eye and who will be a willing donor. I'll offer payment. I don't want you to do that, Dad Hayden. You've done enough for me already. Nonsense. In the meantime, we're getting a nurse out here to look after you for a few days. You don't have to worry about a thing, Dave. I'll take care of all the expenses. No, I don't want that! I don't want a nurse! I can take care of myself. You really should have someone here for a day or two, Dave. TANYA: I'll be here. I'll be glad to come in every day and look after Dave. I want to do it. I feel I should. DAVE: Tanya, well, that's swell of you. It won't be for very long. Only for a few days, until I can find my own way about. DAVE: Sitting here like a slug on a rock, a useless hulk of humanity. Listening to music, to someone else create something, while I... I'll never paint again. Never again. Tanya, is your painting still uncovered? - Yes. - Then cover it. - But Dave... - I'll never be able to finish it. I don't want it out where everyone can look at it and comment on it. It's the only good thing I've ever done. I'll never be able to finish the only good thing I've ever done. I'm sorry. Why do you have to be so everlastingly sorry about everything? You're not to blame! It was a stupid accident. I did it! - It was the painting I meant. - Oh. Don't pay any attention to me, Tanya. I'm upset. I understand. I'll be going now. Good night. DAVE: Heather's fine. We weren't to be married until the painting was finished. But she'll want to go through with it anyway. Got to break it off. She and Nick. At least he isn't blind. Oh, David Stuart. I don't believe you. You don't know what you're saying. But I do know what I'm saying. Our engagement was a mistake. I came here to release you from your obligation to me. Are you trying to play the martyr with me? David, I love you. - I'm not gonna stand for your being noble. - It isn't that, I... I just discovered that I don't love you. Not that way. Dave. David! Why do you have to make this so difficult for me? Can't you realise I'm not in love with you? I'm in love with... Well, I'm in love with Tanya. And under the circumstances, I should think you'd step aside gracefully. Is this her idea? - Did Tanya send you here tonight? - Leave her out of this. Dave, do you know that she's responsible for the loss of your sight? I told you to leave her out of this. It was an accident. She feels badly enough about it as it is. Very well. - What do you want me to do? - Why, nothing... I simply had to tell you the truth. Get it off my mind. Get things settled between us. But... We can go on like we were before, can't we, brat? All right, Dave. Anything you say. You've been mighty decent, Heather. I feel like a heel. - Good night. - Good night, Dave. Oh, Dave! Dave. Dave! You're a pretty sight. Dad Hayden. What're you doing here at this time of the night? - Night? It's morning. - Oh. I wanna have a talk with you. Where's that girl? Tanya? Why, I guess she isn't here yet. I came here as soon as I could... - As soon as I learned... - I don't care to discuss it. Oh, you don't care to discuss it? Well, I do. Where's your backbone? Stand up and fight, man. - Drinking isn't gonna help you. - It's no use. I'm not going to stand idly by watching you waste yourself on that... - Let's leave Tanya out of this. - I can't leave her out of it. I'm not going to let her come between you and Heather. Oh, Dad, why do you want to burden Heather with a blind man? Suppose you are blind, that doesn't mean you always will be. - There's hope. - Hope! Now, listen. I'm an old man. I'm not going to live forever. And I've made arrangements with my lawyers that immediately on my death, my eyes are to be used to restore your sight. You mean that you want them to use your eyes after... Dr. Welles tells me they can, if they do it within a reasonable time. Oh, no, Dad, that's no good. It's too horrible to contemplate. So you're determined to be the martyr, eh? Dad, I don't want to hurt you, or Heather either. But what I told her about Tanya and me is the truth. Well, I had to be fair. You're not gonna throw yourself away on that scheming little adventuress. I won't allow it. I thought I told you to leave Tanya out of this. If I can't bring you to your senses any other way, I'll see what can be done about prosecuting her for deliberately scheming to cause your blindness. I'll jail her for it if it's the last thing I do! Why don't you mind your own business? Now get out of here and let me alone! Dave. Dave. Oh, Dave. Oh, Alan, I'm so glad you're here. I came as soon as I got your call. Here now, what's this? Things can't be that bad. Oh, but they are. Dave's been drinking. And then I heard him in the bedroom, he was crying and sobbing. It was awful. Well, Dave's bound to be difficult. He's going through a torturous period of adjustment. But you really wanna know what's the matter with him? It's Heather. - He broke his engagement to her last night. - He broke off his engagement? Yes. But if Dave weren't blind, he'd crawl back to her on his hands and knees. As long as Dave doesn't have his sight, - he'll never marry Heather. - Tanya, listen to me. You can't give your life to Dave through a mistaken sense of responsibility. He belongs with Heather. He doesn't love you. I do. - You? - Yes. Why do you think I kept coming up here so often? - But I thought Dave, the painting... - No, it was you. You're in my blood, Tanya. I can't think of anything else. Oh, Alan, I'm sorry. I do like you. But, well, as long as Dave needs me, I could never think of anyone else. But it's all wrong, Tanya. It'll never work out for you. - You mean because of Mr. Hayden? - Yes. Don't forget, he's been like a father to Dave. He'll influence him. That's not so. Only this morning, Dave quarrelled with him over me. And Dave told him to get out. I'm going to see Mr. Hayden and put a stop to this. - He's got to leave Dave alone. - No, Tanya, that won't do any good. Well, I'm going to see him anyway. - How are you, old boy? - Oh, Alan. - What are you doing here? - Ijust dropped in to see you. Oh, that's fine. How about a drink? Now, don't you think you've had about enough, fellow? - Are you gonna start preaching too? - No, no, of course not. I'll join you in a nightcap. That's fine. Would you mind pouring it? Gee, I've got a bad taste in my mouth. You'll pardon me for pointing this out to you, but you're not gonna get rid of that taste by taking another drink. You see, I know what's bothering you, my boy. What do you mean? It's a bad case of guilty conscience. You treated Dad Hayden pretty roughly and you know it. It's preying on your mind, isn't it? Come on, admit it. Confession's good for the soul. Get it off your chest. Yes, I... I feel like a heel. Practically threw him out of here. But I'm getting sick of everyone being sorry for me. - All this sympathy. - Yes, I know. But you and Hayden have been too close to let anything come between you now. Dave, you're acting like a man who's lost everything. You heard what Dr. Welles said. There's still hope. Yes, I know. Now what you should do is to patch things up with Dad Hayden. Decide to do that and I'll bet you'll sleep much better tonight. - How about it? - Of course, you're right. - Very well, I'll do it tonight. - Good. Now that that's settled, I'll be on my way. - How about another drink? - No, thanks. See you later. [DOOR CLOSES] DAVE: Alan's right. There is hope. When Dad Hayden dies, I'll have the operation. It might be a success. If Dad Hayden were dead. Good evening, Mr. Phillips. Oh, hello, George. Have you seen Miss Hayden? Yes, sir. She's waiting at the far end table. Has she been here long? - About three quarters of an hour, sir. You're late, Nick. What kept you? I'm sorry, Heather. I was on my way over here and... But I ran into... Skip the excuses, Nick. Why did you drag me away from the house tonight? What's so important? Heather, Ijust had to see you alone. I know this isn't the time or the place, but... - But... - But what? - Straight Bourbon. - Yes, sir. Heather, you know how I feel about you. And now that Dave is... I don't know how to say it, but, he won't hold you. I want you to forget your pity and marry me. Pity? What on earth are you talking about? Can't you possibly understand I'm in love with him? I don't believe it. The only thing that stands in our way is your father. He's just a stubborn, meddlesome old man. That's enough, Nick! I didn't come here tonight to hear my father insulted. And no matter what Dad thinks, I still love Dave. And I'm sure he really loves me. Good night. Oh, but Heather... HEATHER: Dave! Dave, what happened? Heather, I came over to make things right with Dad Hayden tonight, and... Well, no one answered the door, and I let myself in with my own key. Then I came in to find him and... I stumbled over. Dad! Dad! [SCREAMING] He's dead! There's blood on your hands. - Heather, I... - Don't come near me. Heather, you don't think that I... No! Heather! How can you ask me to do such a thing? Such a disfigurement would be horrible enough under ordinary circumstances. But now... It was your father's wish, Heather. But not this way. Not when Dave... Didn't I see him with my own eyes, standing there with Dad's blood on his hands? How can you ask this of me? I'm sorry, Heather. Under the circumstances, it's distressing to me, too. But I promised your father I'd perform the necessary surgery. Regardless of how we feel, I think it should be done. Miss Hayden, painful as this request must seem, legally you cannot prevent this procedure and neither can we. Because I have definite instructions from your father in writing, witnessed by Dr. Welles. Your consent is only a matter of form. But Dr. Welles would rather not proceed without it. Oh, I can't. I simply can't. Heather, you understand it's urgent that we act at once. According to precepts ofjustice, David Stuart is considered innocent until given a fair trial and condemned by an impartial jury. And you in your present state could hardly be considered impartial. Sorry, sir, but you can't go in there. I'm a friend of Dave Stuart's. How is he, Officer? Do you know? I don't know, sir. I'm Captain Drury. - What did you say your name was? - Alan Bittaker. Oh, yes. I've heard of you. A psychiatrist, aren't you? Well, in a small way. Interesting, Doctor. You know, we use a bit of psychology in our business too. What do you make of Stuart? As a psychiatrist, I mean. Well, just what do you mean? Well, his state of mind, his frustrations in being unable to paint. Blindness is a serious thing to happen to an artist. Do you suppose it might drive him to commit murder? I can't believe it. He regarded Hayden as he would his own father. Oh, yes, I know. But the mind is a strange thing. Sometimes it slips out of control in a crisis. But who am I to tell you? Where's Dr. Welles? When's he going to operate? I think he's still at the morgue, removing Hayden's eyes. But he should be here grafting the corneas by now. Why worry, Doctor? Suppose the operation is too late? After all, isn't it rather a waste of time, attempting to restore the vision of a man who may be condemned to die? That's right, Doctor. You have to be, in my business. [ENGINE FALTERING] Taxi! Taxi! MAN: Wait a minute. Give me that container. Come, Tanya. There's no time to lose. Give it to me. How did you find out? I was at the hospital when Dr. Welles telephoned. And I suspected you the minute I heard what happened. Now give them to me. Tanya, keeping Dave blind isn't gonna hold him for you. Don't you see in his heart he'll always continue to love Heather? - No. I will not believe that. - And you want him blind? No, I don't want Dave blind. Go, hurry. I don't want Dave blind. I don't know why I did it. I don't know why. I think you're right, Doctor. Now where's Moriarty? I told him not to leave here. Well, for... Here's the missing container! Where did it come from? - Are you sure? - Of course I'm sure. I thought I told you not to leave here. Where have you been? Why, you see, sir, I was sitting over there, and then all of a sudden... Oh, yes, yes, all right. Where did you get that container? - What container? - The one we found on the chair. - You know, the container with the eyes. - A container with eyes? Why, Chief, the only thing that I saw that had eyes was the... - Hello, Captain. - Better not go in there now. I think they're getting him ready for the operation. Well, what about the missing eyes? They showed up rather mysteriously. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you, Bittaker? No, no, I wouldn't. DAVE : Heather. Don't come near me. You don't think I... There's blood on your hands. No! Heather, come back! - Heather. Heather! - You must lie still, boy. You must not move your head. DOCTOR: You must not move your head. You must not move your head. DAVE: How long? Doctor, is there a chance? Do you really think I'll see? If I could only be sure. Hurry, won't you? Please be calm. This will only take a moment. Now, Dave, let your eyes open slowly, only to slits, so that they can gradually become accustomed to the light. All right. Yes. It's dark. - Is it dark in here? - Nurse, open the blinds. How's that? I'm blind. I'm still blind. I can't see. - I can't see. - Now, now, just a minute, Dave. Sometimes the first shock of daylight does that. It takes a little while to wear off. No. I know. I'm blind. No, it's too early to tell yet. Now, hold still. Alan? - Yes, Dave? - I'm blind. Do you hear? I'm still blind. Dave, I know anything I might tell you now will mean very little to you. But you're free to go home. Go home? Heather was responsible for it. - Heather? - Yes. At the inquest the other day, she mentioned that she met Nick at a cocktail lounge the night that Dad Hayden was killed. But Nick? They don't suspect him, do they? Yes. She eliminated his alibi by telling them he was late. Further examination established the fact that he had the opportunity and a motive. And although you're still considered a suspect too, at least she helped establish a reasonable doubt of your guilt. But does Heather still think that I killed Dad Hayden? She can't be sure of anything, now. Then why hasn't she been to see me? - She must still think that I... - Give her time. She's had several shocks. If I could only see again. - I owe so many people so much. - Nonsense. Now be calm, everything's going to be all right. We'll be going home soon. DAVE: A nail. A little threaded nail. Where did I get it? Now I remember. It was on the carpet near his head I must have dropped it into my pocket and forgotten all about it. I wonder if it means anything. [DOOR OPENS] Who is it? - Is that you, Tanya? - No, it's not Tanya. She's gone. I've been waiting for her to leave. - Who are you? - Remember me? I'm Captain Drury. Oh, yes. My old friend, Drury. Nice, comfortable place you have here. How did you get in? Wasn't the door locked? Oh, well, I didn't want to disturb you by ringing the bell. Oh, what do you want? Thanks, I'll make myself comfortable. What do you know about that little model who left here? Who, Tanya? Nothing, why? Spends a lot of time here. She's kind of crazy about you, isn't she? Not really. It's just a sense of mistaken responsibility. Because... Because she caused your blindness, indirectly? Or did she mean to do it? No, of course she didn't. It was a stupid mistake on my part. But she does feel responsible, eh? She and old man Hayden didn't get along very well, did they? No, he didn't approve of her. But that was because he didn't understand. She has no alibi for the evening of Hayden's death. After she left here, she said she went directly home. But she could have stopped at Hayden's place on the way, huh? That's ridiculous. Well, maybe so. But I should think, in your position, you'd be rather anxious to pin this murder on somebody else. After all, you're still my favourite suspect. What about Nick Phillips? I thought... I haven't ruled Nick Phillips out or anybody else, yet. What do you know about Alan Bittaker? Alan? He's one of my oldest friends. What possible connection could he have with this case? Did you know that somebody stole Hayden's eyes just after Doc Welles removed them from the body? No. They later turned up at the hospital rather mysteriously. It's my opinion that Tanya took them. And that Bittaker got them from her and returned them. But why? As long as you're blind, you remain dependant upon Tanya. And I think she rather likes it that way. She knows that if you regain your sight, she'll lose you to Miss Hayden. So she tried to prevent the operation. But Bittaker intervened and returned the eyes. He was afraid she might get into trouble, so he did it anonymously. I don't believe it! It's a nice theory though, isn't it? Well, you'll be seeing me. Oh, Nick. I wish you'd go. I'm expecting Alan. But Heather, you must listen to me. How could you do it? - Do what? - Implicate me! Practically incriminate me! I tell you, I'm innocent. Heather, you don't believe that, do you? Nick, I'm so mixed up, I don't know what to think. - Please go. - But, Heather... ALAN: Hello, Heather. - Hello, Alan. - Hello, Nick. - Heather, I'd like to talk to you. - About Dave, I suppose? Oh, Nick! For heaven's sake, will you please get out of here? Oh, so now you're going to kick me out? Oh, nonsense! This girl is upset. Quit tormenting her and have the decency to leave when she asks you to. You're against me, too. You're all against me. Heather, you must go and see Dave. - Oh, Alan, I can't. - He needs you, Heather. I know in your heart you want to believe him innocent. But he thinks you believe him guilty. Alan, I don't know. I'm so confused, I'm not sure of anything. Well, think it over. At least you should be willing to reserve judgment. If you don't see him and later he's proved innocent, you'll never forgive yourself. Yes, I suppose you're right, Alan. But I must have time to collect myself. DAVE: She's spying, spying on me. She's been acting strangely all da y. - Tanya. - Yes? Come here. What do you want? with a man. Before you go, I'd like to show you something. What is it? Something that I think should interest you. Does that mean anything to you? No. Why should it? Because I found it next to Dad Hayden's body the night he was murdered. - I know nothing about it. How should I? - You tell me. I don't know what it is. I don't. I must go now. I'm late. Look here, if something's troubling you, I'd like to know it. You can confide in me. It's just David. - What's he done now? - Nothing. But I think he suspects me. - You didn't tell him about what I... - No, I didn't tell him. - He still thinks only of Heather. - Oh, so that's it? You realise he still loves Heather. You're jealous. - Yes. I hate her. - Now, you mustn't talk like that. That's what you said about her father and... Well, isn't this a cozy little twosome. So this is why you're trying to patch things up between Heather and Dave. Don't make a fool of yourself, Nick. There's a method to your madness, Dr. Bittaker. - Now go away before you create a scene. - Yes, Dr. Bittaker. And how is our poor, blind, murdering patient tonight? - Better, I trust? - He's not the murderer. He's as guilty as sin and I'm going to prove it. No, Alan. Please. Take me home. Cheque, please. Thank you, sir. Good night, all. There they are, boss. Should I follow them again? Yes. Don't let them get away from you. [TELEPHONE DIALING] - Heather? Miss Hayden? - Yes, who is this? Tanya? What is it? What do you want? Miss Hayden, I think I know who killed your father. I should have called the police, but well, I think you're the one to decide. You know who... Whom do you mean? No! Tanya? Tanya! No! Don't come near me! [SCREAMING] Hello? Hello? Hello? [PHONE RINGING] Hello? I want the police. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] - Tanya? Come in. - DRURY: It's not Tanya. - The door's locked. - Drury. - So you were expecting Tanya, were you? - Not exactly. You see, she left here yesterday in a bad humour. I don't know whether she is coming back. She left in a bad humour, did she? What's the matter, did you have a fight? Not really. She's a moody person. - She was sulking. - About what? I don't know. Not that it's any of your business. Do you know if she had any reason for calling Miss Hayden on the telephone last night? She did? Well, she's very unpredictable. She's unpredictable? - She got herself murdered last night. - What? Murdered. Struck down by the well-known blunt instrument. She got hers the same way Hayden got his. Where? What's that got to do with her telephoning Heather? She telephoned Miss Hayden because she'd learned, or she suspected the true identity of the person who killed her father. But before she could tell what she knew she got it. Why wasn't I told about this before? 'Cause I didn't want to disturb you. I instructed Miss Hayden not to call anyone until we checked on the Czoraki girl's apartment. Where were you last night, Stuart? - I was here, asleep. - Oh, is that so? We had a report that a man was seen leaving this building, following Tanya last night. It was getting dark about then, so the man wasn't identified. Of course, it couldn't have been you. This man could see. We're looking for the driver who picked him up, to get a better identification. Take off your glasses, Stuart. - What are you trying to do, burn me? - You sure you can't see? I heard you strike a match. Felt the heat. What did Tanya Czoraki know? I don't know. She was a good-looker, wasn't she? One of those dark, mysterious kinds. You never can tell what's going on inside their heads. - Where did she go when she left here? - Told you, I don't know. She said she was going out with a man. Yeah, that was with Alan Bittaker. And later in the evening, they ran into Nick. It's odd, isn't it? Bittaker said that she was acting strange and moody last night. Oh, she was, poor kid. I had her pegged as a possible murderess. She was capable of it, too. This is a great painting of her. It catches her warmth and her passion. It's too bad you can't see so you could have finished it. Yes, Stuart, it's too bad you can't see. - Are you sure you didn't go out last night? - No, I didn't. You know, it's a funny thing. Miss Hayden told me she tried to get you on the phone just after Tanya's call, but there was no answer. Well, I'll be running along. - Drury... - How did you know I hadn't gone out? DAVE: It's the nail. This nail. It's the key to everything. She knew the secret. But she can't tell anyone now. You followed us from that nightclub. I looked back and saw you come out of that cafe as I pulled away. And I know a cab followed us to her apartment. I tell you, I didn't. Why would I want to kill her? Because she found out, or guessed something about the murderer of Hayden. - Now, you wouldn't... - I didn't. I didn't follow you. But someone did. I saw a cab pull out right after you left. - I saw... - Who? Who was it? I don't know. When they catch up with you, Nick, I'd have a pretty clear story to tell. DAVE: That's it. - What happened, Trevers? - I don't know, Miss. TREVERS: Who's there? Who is it? Nick! What on earth? - What are you doing here? - It was Dave. I saw him. Dave? Why are you holding that cane? Well, I guess I picked it up during the fight. I've always suspected Dave and now I'm sure of it! He can see, Heather, I know it! How do you know? Because I followed him here. I watched him through that window. He walked deliberately to that cane-rack and picked up all the canes. As he started out that door, he must have upset something. The noise scared him off, and I caught him as he tried to get away. - Shall I call the police, Miss Heather? - No, no. Just let me think a minute. If you don't, I will. He's played on your sympathies long enough! [DOORBELL RINGING] - Who's there? - ALAN: Alan, Dave. What is it? Why did you call me to come here in such a hurry at this hour of the night? Here, give me your hat and stick. - Did you see anyone outside? - No. Who? Why? - I'm in a jam. You've got to help me! - Well, what's the matter? The police think that I killed Tanya. - Yes? - I didn't. - You did. - What? - You're insane. Why, I loved that girl. - I know. But you had to kill the thing you loved because you loved life more. You're a madman! I've suspected it before, now I know. Losing your sight has permanently deranged your mind. No, Alan. I thought so for a while. I suspected Tanya had killed Dad Hayden. But I believed if she did, it was to help me. Well, I couldn't turn her in, could I? I didn't know what to do. So what did you do? I showed her something. That something led her to discover that you're a murderer. You killed Dad Hayden! And what did you show her, Dave? This. I found it next to Dad Hayden's body. Tanya noticed that just such a nail as this was missing from the head of your walking stick. When she called Heather to tell her of her suspicions, you overheard and killed her. Dad Hayden was killed the same way. Only two people could have done it, you or Nick. And Nick doesn't carry a walking stick. This nail shook loose the night that you beat Dad Hayden to death. You never missed it, see how well it fits? Let's see. It's gonna hang you, Alan. My dear fellow, what possible reason would I have for killing Hayden? So that I could have his eyes. Blindness was the only tie that held Tanya to me. You wanted me to see again so that you could have her. Dave, your analysis is right. Blindness has sharpened your mind. But not enough to see everything. Your only mistake was asking me to come here tonight. You can see! Too bad you didn't guess that before, Dr. Bittaker. All right, Captain. Let's be on our way. You won, I lost. Let's just get this unpleasant business over with. I wouldn't be surprised if this man were insane. He wouldn't be the first one who'd gone mad studying the processes of the mind. Precisely, Captain. I compliment you on your sagacity. You know, it's people like you that have caused me to steer clear of all this book psychology. Farewell, friend David. I'll be going this time for good, Stuart. Oh, there's someone outside here waiting to see you. I'll send her in. - Oh, Dave! Are you all right? - Sure, brat. Please forgive me for doubting you. Why didn't you tell me the operation was a success? At first, it wasn't. Then my sight gradually returned, and I thought, by remaining blind to others, that I might trap the murderer. I was suspicious of Tanya and watching her. Oh, that poor girl. It must have been terrible for her. But from now on, everything's going to be all right. - Sure, brat. - Please don't call me brat. All right, brat.
