Margarita, but I'll have whatever you having. - Fantastic. - This is a little thing I made for you and it's more of a good luck charm. Wow, look at this. Is that the Buddha's ghoul thing? No, it's not. What is it? It's a nut. Yeah. You have to open the nut. You got to open the nut. - I knew you gonna say some... - Oh, here it is. You see how cute? There's this woman in China that told me how to make them. - Okay. - And it will bring you good luck so, I figure you can put it in your new office. In your new office drawer. Very thoughtful of you. Thank you. In the event, this is Barking Iron Applejack whiskey, 100% New York apples, small batches. It is fucking smooth. - This is great. - They're delicious. What the shit, man? You didn't had to do this. Joe, your shoe. Excuse me, we are talking fine liquor, here. Am I right? You are right but you know the rules. Come on, man. Take them off. - Seriously? - Yes. You know it's not me. Don't give me hard time. - Just take them off. - All right, all right. Jesus! Where is she? - She's getting ready. - Fuck. Here it is, of course. - Here are my shoes. - Thank you. - Enjoy. Baby, can you be more you today and not that guy? I am that guy. Remember, you married him. Yeah, I love him to. Just, please, be less of him, today. Okay? Thank you, baby. Come on, Anna. But I say it just to reach you, Anna. - Julia? Anna! You are talking about the Beatles song? - It's Julia, Joe. ♪ Half of what I say is meaningless ♪ ♪ But I say it just to reach you ♪ - Julia! - Anna! - It's Anna. - No. It's definitely not Anna. What are you talking about? The song was composed and performed as a solo work by John Lennon for his mother, Julia! Wow. Aren't you, miss smarty pants? Why don't you sing it for us, Sus? - You are such an ass. - You got a great voice. - Yeah, right. - Brighten up our day, please. Okay, get me drunk first, I'll sing what ever you guys want. I can do that. - Let's do it. - Start pouring. I am going to wash my hands. You got it. Very nice. Hey. Hey. I got some stuff cooking in the oven. Oh, wow. Would you want... Do you want this apple stuff or do you want something else? You decide. I have to celebrate to maturity today. You make the rules. Hey, I like that. I don't think she'll go for it. I am sure today is gonna be different. Probably not. Come on. She's proud of you. Oh, yeah, she is but... you know how she sees things. Stop it right there. Sometimes you have to go all in and you are doing it. Well, I appreciate it. To you. It's a little... - It's strong. Good though. - I could use it. How is it going with you, guys? Us? Yeah, we are great. Yeah... - Couldn't be better. - Oh, I am so happy. Really happy. Trying to convince her to go back to counseling. That's a great idea, Tom. All right. Need a drink. Hey. - Cheers. - Cheers. - So what do you think? - I like it. - Shit. Where's Anna? - Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah. Honey? You okay? Honey? Yeah, I'm coming. - Feeling better? - Yeah. - Yeah, I had to take something. - Okay. My stomach, is just... Come here, come here. Let me see. Let me look at you. - What? - Let me feel you. Come here. I think I know what the problem is. What? You're too beautiful. Thank you, baby. - Are they here? - They are here. Ah, you guys are so cute. - Hey love. - Hi. There she is. How are you doing? Not bad. How's the restaurant? Haven't been in a while. It's busy. - As always. - Yeah. That's my girl. Always working. Well, we love what we do. Right? God know, she deserves a break. Maybe you should just do it. Doesn't work like that. Yeah, it's not that easy. We can take a little weekend getaway. If I had some spare time I actually like to start renovation if I am not in the restaurant. All work and no play makes Anna a dull girl. Are you saying am boring? - What? No, am just... Come on, babe. Saying you need a little break, that's all. So, you are still thinking about renovating? I am. Let me know if you want the fung shui consultation. I completely forgotten about that. - Don't worry about it. - Am sorry. When can you come in? Whenever you want. Tomorrow morning at 10am. Mondays are slower, at least they are slower. Okay, perfect. Monday. Tomorrow at 10. - Okay. - Exciting. I can't wait. You guys want to see the living room? - Why? - Come on. What did you do? Did you arrange it? - I took some of your advice. - Really? - Yeah, check it out. - You'll see. - Let me see. I did the best that I could, anyway. - It's okay. - The feng shui... - Wow... You did it. As you can see I didn't use feng shui for the furniture but I took your advice on the paintings... - Yeah. This is perfect. Doesn't it feel good? Yeah, it does. Sus has as gift. She transformed my office, makes me feel more calm and productive. - Thank you, baby. I mean, I would have liked it blue but... - No. - We agreed on it. Yeah, we agreed. Orange is the perfect color for a living room. Guys, this is the social color. Look, it brings people together and encourages connection. Blue, I told you is for the bedroom. Because it calms you, relaxes you, and prepares you for the night. Yeah, the orange is good. It connects me to the new TV. - Did you notice this? - Very nice. We are gonna watch games here or what, man? All in brother. I mean, I would have gone bigger but I got overruled by boss. I think it's big enough. Agreed. Can't never be too big. Hey, cheers to that. I love this view. It is a nice view. We should move up here, Joe. I know you are not complaining about our loft in Soho. No. You know I love our place but... ...'cause there is something about a bridge. I don't know it just brings me peace and makes me feel all creative. It was definitely a selling point for us. I love the view, too. But it's weird, every time I see a bridge, I always think about people jumping off. - That is bad. - I don't know. Yeah. I had a reoccurring dream about the Brooklyn Bridge. Such a beautiful dream Since I was seven years old. - Yeah? - Yeah. I am walking from my old neighborhood in Carol Gardens and I get up to the bridge, and all of the sudden it's late at night and I am all alone. I keep walking, I see lower Manhattan light up and it's gorgeous and am walking and all of the sudden the bridge opens up and becomes like a draw bridge but it's not, - it's the Brooklyn bridge. - Yeah. But am not scared, am fearless. I walk to the top and I am standing there and I... like, this is my city. This is my bridge. And I start to fly. Am, like, floating over the eastern river, spot the Statue of Liberty, and am about to land in the Battery and... I wake up. - I think I know what it means. - What does it mean, Tom? - Can I go? - Yeah, go ahead. You are narcissist. - Oh, come on, man. - What? - Guilty as charge. - Am I wrong? Tell them what it means. I don't know, am no expert but I just love the idea that he was the same Joe then that he is now. - I can see that. - Because crossing the bridge, without fears means that you are ready to face whatever the future holds in store. I'm flying, like you said, it's so beautiful, it's... It means that nothing can hold you down or keep you from reaching your goal. - I already knew. - My husband. - Seven years old. - No. I think, am right, though. I don't think dreams mean anything at all. It's just our subconscious squeezing a bunch of thoughts together. Come on guys. - They don't mean anything. I don't know, baby. It's a thing to speculate on. Yeah, even if it's our subconscious squeezing our thoughts together, what comes out of it can give you precious insight. Maybe. Then there is a theory that we are actually dreaming when we are awake. And we are awake when we are dreaming. Yeah. How's theory is that? - Judge Judy. - You're so full of shit. - I believe dreams are messages from past lives. Or moments of our future that we haven't lived, yet. You know when you have a deja vu? You can even see them as life premonitions. I do. You're saying your psychic, now? - My little witch. Our dreams can say a lot about our desires, our fears... Maybe am just saying I would never live my life based on what my dreams tell me. Do you have any reoccurring dreams? I'm having more of a reoccurring nightmare, right now. - It started about a year ago. - What is it? - It doesn't mean anything. - You never know. Come on. Okay. I'm in the middle of a field, and am running from something. It's cold and dark and mud everywhere, and I find this little hole. I crawl inside to hide, and there's people in there. I look outside and there's this big, nasty Borg, and I know that's what chasing me. So, I take a deep breath and when I exhale steam comes through the hole and the Borg sees me cocked his head and starts running towards me, and then I wake up. Scary. - Very scary. - Wow. You are running from something that hurts you. And if it's find you again, it will hurt you, again. And that's usually associated with insecurity. Anxiety, like if you are avoiding something painful. Maybe? I don't know. It can be a million different things, you know. Dreams are like that, your like, well maybe this... You never told me about that dream. It doesn't mean anything. I guess. Kill the Borg next time. Easier said than done. It's gonna take you some courage. There's a light house underneath the bridge and ever since we moved in, I've been having this reoccurring dream about it. - Where is it? - Yes, there's a lighthouse it's right on the shore, underneath the bridge. A national landmark. Does it look like a small penis? - Oh, Jesus. - I think I have the meaning of this one. Why? Are you having that reoccurring dream? It's all you, buddy. - No, actually in my dream, - asshole... - Yeah... I'm on a boat, right. And am completely dehydrated. And I've got this really thick, really long and pointy hipster beard, and I am headed towards the shore, and I see this flashing light from the lighthouse as the fog starts to disappear. And then I see all this people just standing on the dock but they don't have a face. My heart starts racing, I start breathing fast, I want to go back but it's too late, and then I turn around and I see, - Anna standing behind me... - Oh? What? She, you push me over and I wake up. That's so funny. What's so funny about? The last time you had this fucking boat dream, - it was your mother. - Yeah. And then the time before that it was your brother... - Well, it's reoccurring. - Oh, wait. - Now it's you. - You liked your boss, right? Yeah, he was like a father to me. Okay, I know this one. So, all the people that you care and trust, love are there. Yes. There is the fear of losing them, and to being controlled... But wait, wait. I think it's just because of your new job. You are going to be fine. We are victims of our own faults. Who isn't a victim of their own faults? I like the dream, really. Well, maybe you like it 'cause you feel safe and this is, sort of, reoccurring pattern. You starting to change my mind about the dream thing. I like the dream because I had this beard in it and I can't grow one -in this life 'cause am patchy, so, I think that's what dream represents. - That's true. - It's not about the loved ones, - and my job it's about my beard. - Yeah, right. I got the opposite problem. I have to shave at lunch everyday if I want to keep a smooth look. So jealous of you and your big ass beard. - We always want what we can't have. I would have liked to have had a bedroom in here. - Really? - Yeah. - First time you told me. - Well, I didn't think you'll like the idea. - Well, we can change it. - No, make it blue if you switch. Nah, it's too late. Yeah, I guess it's too late. Our doorman said, that he and his wife have the happiest marriage because of one thing. Lots of sex? - That's what I said. No, it's because they change the colors of their walls every six months, they completely rearrange the furniture... He says it keeps their minds of wanting to kill each other. - That's true. I think it would make us do the exact opposite. I think it's charming. Whatever works, right. - Right. - Cheers to that! Oh, I need another one. - Oh, please. - You guys, drinks? I have my drink over there. - All of us. - All right. We're good. We're feeling connected from the orange... - Orange... - Of course. That's what it does Feeling warm. Brings all of us together. - It's nice TV, dude. - Yeah, I know. I got a great deal on that, too. Because it was a floor sample. So I got it at 50% off. - Fill her up. - Yeah, you got it. It just takes a lot of time. - I love this chair. - I saw that. It's amazing. - I love it, too. Why don't you sell it to me, dude? Oh, that's never gonna happen, Joe. Let's not try this again, please. I wouldn't mind. Hey, that is the first piece of furniture that we both together. - Fine. Can't believe you'll sell it. It's an object. I have the memory. Well I would like to have the object with the memory. Sorry, Joe, we would never, ever sell it. - You have zero romanticism. - That's not true. - It is true. I'm the one who always cries during movies. Oh, that's true. He even cried during The Avengers. - Homo. - Hey! I was invested in the characters, all right? Who always make sure we call your parents, every Christmas, every birthday? We do that together. Yeah, well who sends your grandma a Christmas card, every year? - Fine. You're the woman. That's not what am saying. That sounds like that's what you say. Joe, you're not helping. - Your insecure like a woman. That's why you got those hair implants. - What the fuck, baby? No fucking way! What? You're the one to talk. I spray your hair, every morning with fibers. What is that? It's a powder that I have to put on the bald spot... Okay, am not bold, right. I had an accident, as a child. I have scars on the top of my head. The follicle is dead. - Yeah, sure. - Whatever. It doesn't matter. It's nothing to be ashamed off. - I'm not ashamed. - It's part of getting old. Well, am ashamed and that's why I got a hair transplant. - And I would appreciate, if no one fucking talks about it or knows about it, - thank you very much. - Never be able to tell you have an implant. Looks natural. - I would have shaved it off, but Anna wouldn't like it. Me? - No, the other Anna. You fell in love with me because I had long hair. You used to call me Samson. Baby, that was 15 years ago. Oh, so you wouldn't care if I shaved it off? Might be a nice change... Really? You're telling me this now? - It would make your eyes pop. - All right. Let's do it. Your eyes would pop. Come on. I dare you to shave your head. Oh, my God. No. Anna. Anna, you have clippers? - No, I don't. - No. All right. You know what, am gonna go buy some clippers. Oh, you gonna buy some clippers? Let's do this. It's gonna be fun. I dare you to shave your head. No. Oh, dare me. That's gonna work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Chicken. First of all, am not shaving my head, second of all, I don't even look good... Who give a fuck if you look good? I'm daring you to shave your head. Stop daring me. What are we? Back in college? Yeah, you were chicken back then, too. - Who drank his own piss? - What? You don't know this story. I never said I was gonna drink - my own fucking piss. - Yes, you did. - No, I didn't. Didn't say it. - Okay. He says, let's drink our own piss, as a dare. - No. - We both pee in this - shot glasses... - You can't pee in shot glasses. - We pee in the shot glass, I take a shot first, on my own... - Oh, my God. - And this, asshole... This is a good story. Didn't happen but nice, yeah. - Such a chicken. - Never said it, never said it. Okay, I'll shave my head but you have to shave your balls. What the fuck? I would do that but Susan likes it all natural. - Oh, jeez. - True or false? - Oh, come on. - True or false, Susan? True, guys. I like it bushy down there. It's all natural and 100% organic, baby. You throw those fibers on the bush? Those are natural hair building fibers. You lose, again. - As always. - Oh, right. - 'Cause you always win. - I do. I always do. - Yeah. - Yeah. I do. You know what? - I'm gonna prove it again. - What's happening? - It's been too long. - What are you doing? You know what am doing. All right ladies, you are in for the treat. - Okay. - Okay. - Let's do it. - You want to go - over the top. - I'm going over the top. - Is this a rooster fight? - It's a cock fight, baby. - Who-ho! - I like it! - Let's see who is the big cock. - All right. - You sure you want this? - No. Susan? - Yeah. You gonna count? Did you just spit in your hands? - Ewww. He's mental. - I'm not fucking around. - It's disgusting. - I'm not fucking around. - Go wash your hands. - It's all or nothing. - I'm not doing this now. - It's organic, babe. All right. Gross. - Count us down. - Okay. Three, two, one, go. - Boo-ya. - I wasn't set. Oh, you cunt, you fucking cheater. I cheat? I got two witnesses here. Here come the excuses. Oh, I cheated. My wife doesn't let me eat enough meat. That's true. My wife doesn't let me eat enough meat. I don't let you eat enough meat? - No. - No. I'm not your mother. Yeah, you kinda are. You know how I hate when you say that. You know it's all that tofu stuff you give me, baby. Don't worry. He could never be the champ, Suzy. - Yeah. - A man needs his meat. Enough with the broccoli. Broccoli has the same amount of protein as beef. Right. I, uh... - What? Am curious. No, I know, you believe it. Yeah, you think your stronger then me because am vegetarian? I don't think so, I know so. I mean, look at Joe. What about him? Baby, he didn't loose because of a diet. - Of course he did. - No, it's because am stronger, but way smarter, way smarter. Oh, do you wanna arm wrestle? - No. No. What? - Yes, yes. 'Cause you know your gonna lose? I'm gonna lose what? The big award here? Baby, do with Joe. - Why? - Come on, do it. You want me to wrestle a girl? Yeah, maybe you'll have a chance then. Hey, I dare you. Guys... Baby, do not let me down, all right. - Don't hurt me. - Here we go. - I'm fragile. - Ready? Come on. You got this. - She's strong. - Yes, she's strong. - Go. Come on. You got it. Oh, yeah. - Give the man some steak. - Come on baby. You can eat whatever you want. I don't care. - Just thought you believed it. - I do believe it. Believe in what? - Nah, it's a long story. - Don't be embarrassed, honey. Share with your friends. Yeah, nothing can be more embarrassing than -what just happened. - What? - Okay. All right. You wanna know the truth? If the world keeps eating meat, the way it does, in about 30 to 40 years we're not gonna have much of the world left to live in. Who says so? - Everybody. - Everybody. - Scientists... - What scientists? - Doctors... - Which doctor? What name? You know what? The corporations and the politicians they don't want you to know the truth. - That's right. - They want to treat you like puppets. Like keep you not knowing what's really going on. I think you are a little paranoid. - No, am not. - This is serious. You've heard... They are cutting down the rain forest in South America, right. Right? Animal agriculture is contributing, more greenhouse gases then the transportation industry. And we can stick our head in the sand all we want, but eventually, it's gonna catch up. To the non-believers, Anna. Okay? And by then, it's gonna be too late. Look, the world it's gonna be unfixable. It's not that we are non-believers, but the problem in your argument is your standing on this vegetarian soap box, but you are wearing leather fucking shoes. - I never said I was perfect. - Yeah, come on. It's part of the process. He's slowly transitioning. - Takes time. - Joe, you can't do this. Who am I gonna eat hotdogs with at the Mets games? You know what they have? They have tofu dogs. - That's right. - Those are disgusting. No, they are so good. You can't tell the difference. They are delicious. You know what, let's cook a veterinarian meal at our place, and you guys can have a rematch, too. - Fine, you can lose again. - No, you can cheat again. - That's all right. Today, I want you to be the winner. - I don't want you charity. - Yeah? - Okay, let's do it next Sunday. - Let's do it. - That's perfect. You guys are gonna love it. - Next Sunday? - Yeah. All right. Wait, I got to make sure am not in LA. - Are you chickening out? - No, no, no. I wanna be there, I just have to make sure... Oh, fuck! Goddammit. This isn't charging. Oh, sometimes that plug doesn't work. Sometimes this plug doesn't work? - Sometime it does. - You saw me plug, my fucking, phone in here, man. Well, just use the other plug. - Jesus Christ. - Baby, can you just turn it off? Do I have to answer that, Susan? Am waiting for a call from Ray. Am I not? When Ray calls, I pick up. - End of story. - I know. Can you turn it off after Ray calls? - There he goes. Excuse me. Hey, man. Yeah... - Want another one? - Double. No, no, no, no. Come on, man, we... No, I told you people. If he doesn't sign by the end of the day on Friday, he's not traveling tomorrow, end of story. Is it me or what? - I don't understand. - No, no. We waited, the studio waited... Everybody's waited for two weeks. It's fucking bullshit, come on. - Yeah... - I don't know. I don't like to sleep. - Okay. That's what am talking about, baby. I only close the restaurant on Sundays. All right. Hey, hey, am not your side. You do this so you can stay with your husband. As soon as my assistant confirms she received the email, I will call you back. Or you call me. Okay, all right. Good. Good, good, good. All right, talk to you soon. Peace. Jesus. Fucking idiots. I love it. Mr. Big shot. You are the walking cliché for what someone thinks of when they say Hollywood agent. I live in New York, okay. And you know what? Am a care taker. - Is this gonna work? - I think so. - Yeah? Should I try it? Jesus. - Sometimes. Unbelievable. But, you know, am a care taker, okay. But no matter how many times... Thank fucking God. No matter how many times, you lay out all the details, they try to pull the same old bullshit, okay. But they know me by now, they know am the bad cop, and they know, my clients always win. So, who was that? - I can't tell you. - Come on. - But he's fucking huge. There's no movie without my guy. Got them by the balls. Where's my drink? Okay, enough work talk, now. It's Tom's day today. How do you feel? How is he supposed to feel? He's working for himself. - I'm excited. - Yes. Yes. All right, everybody. A toast. Come on. - All right. - Oh, yes. Finally. All right? Baby, want a margarita or something? - No, am okay with water. - Really? - Yeah. - Oh, come on. You can't toast with water. Am not really feeling... Poor some AppleJack. It's very smooth. Don't make a big fuss. - It's very smooth. - That's right. I make the rules and the rules are everybody... I don't want a fucking drink. Fuck off. If she's not feeling up to it, that's totally fine. I get you some lemon, honey. Fine, it's not a big deal I'm gonna get another drink. Joe? Absolutely. I'll get some ice. Can you, please, turn the oven off? I'm gonna use the bathroom, Joe. See that? It's never my day. You know what it is today? It's not my fucking day. Yeah, but you should relax, too. What am I supposed to do? - She always takes the fun away. - Not always. Come on, she just doesn't want to drink. Yeah, 'cause it's always something. Either she's got a headache or she's got anxiety, 'cause she's working too much. I mean, it's always something. Don't project. Whose side your 're on? Really? I want you to enjoy and relax together. - It's your day. Hey! Live in the present. Remember? - Okay. - The present is the only gift we have. Nothing else. Well, then I have very shitty gift. Is she still taking hormones? Those mess with you, big time. No. Stop that months ago. I thought you guys trying again. No, no. Nothing's going on. Oh, except for that am making the biggest carrier move of my life while at the same time my relationship with my wife is falling to shit. Other than that, everything is perfect. Maybe she's just being messing. For entire year? - Okay. Listen. It's always good to defuse the situation. - Right... And an apology always does that. Even when you are right, Tom, I know it's hard but let it go. - Breathe. - You are saying right. - Yeah, I know. - But... - I'm breathing. - Very good. - I'm breathing. - You're in a good mood today. - Please, leave me alone, Joe. - Yeah, I leave you alone. - Really, am not feeling... So hormonal. - How do you know? - 'Cause I know women. Oh, sure you do. Hey. This is his special day, right. It's about him today, okay. He work his ass off and you should be happy for him. Am so happy. Just hate it when you are sarcastic. Well like I care what you think. - What the fuck is going on? - Nothing's going on. You are acting like a goddam teenage girl. I can act whatever the fuck I want. Jesus Christ, would you tell me what is happening? I'm not Tom, okay. - No you're not Tom. - You can tell me what's going on. Anna! I'm pregnant. I'm pregnant. How did happen? No, I mean I know how did happen but how did that happen? I don't know. I guess my body finally decided it was ready. Oh, fuck. Well that's fantastic. Right? What I've been telling you? You guys stress out, it sucks all your money and gives you anxiety, and the second you relax it happened. It's beautiful. What did Tommy say? What do you mean? I haven't told him yet. Well, why not? He is going to be thrilled. This is reason to celebrate. Are you fucking crazy? What did he do this time? He told me he wants to buy an original Botero. - Oh, that's a new one. What your talking about? I mention that weeks ago. Oh, I don't know. It's hard to keep up with you. - Honey, your lemon is there. - Thank you. Thank you, Susan. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry, babe. All right. Let's have that toast. Everybody got their glass? - Yes. - Anna has her lemon water. - To Tom, - Hey... and his future successes. To the most dedicated, annoyingly cheery, son of a bitch I know. I am very proud of you, Tom. Thank you. This is great. Can you feel the positive energy flowing again? I wanna give you my blessing, too. Let's hold hands and close our eyes. What? Let's hold hands and close our eyes. - Just do it! - Really? - Yes. - Let's do it, let's do it. Let's hold hands and close our eyes. Okay... Imagine yourself, right in front of the big beautiful mountain. The sun is warming up your skin, breath the fresh air in, and let all the negativity out. - Very good, Tom. What the fuck? You should see a doctor. - Come on, Joe. Look on top of the mountain. Who's there? Yes, it's you on top of the mountain enjoying yourself, and look down. Now it's time for you to let it go, to let all the negative energy, all the fears, everything out, you can scream your heart out. Tom first. - Me? - Yes! I don't know what to say. Yeah, come on. You do. I really, I really don't. Come on, just listen to yourself connect with your emotions, don't judge it. Just go. Come on. I'm horny and hungry. - Your such a kid, Joe. Keep it down over there. Sorry, Mr. Shwartz. I thought that guy was dead. - Yeah, so did we. Is this dude that makes the weird noises like he's... like jerking off while having a stroke? Yeah, that's the guy. Yeah, I think he has Tourette's. Well, he's got something. We haven't heard from him for few weeks. Yeah, we though he was dead and then last night he started screaming again, he started screaming; "Are you there? Are you there?" - So what did you do? - I felt compelled to reply - to him. - What did you say? I just said; "Yeah, am here, am here." - And then he just shut up. I don't know. I think he spy's on us. I bet he does. I bet he has a peep hole right through those books. Well, he's only knocked one time before so... good job, Joe. Susan, told me to let it all out. For the record, it was Tom who was supposed to let it all out. I thought it was an open invitation. Hey! You took the words right out of my mouth. Uh, whatever you are about to say, honey, don't. Yeah, please. Hey, you guys have to try this cheese. An Italian client of mine brings it down to me every year. - From Franco, right? - He's this cute little old man, who hikes this mountain in Italian Alps just to get it. - He's oppressed with Anna. - Who isn't? Is it with cow milk? - Oh, come on. - Yeah, it's all natural. Yeah, I know. But cow milk is not good for you. You know the only good cheese are sheep or goat. Cow milk in general is not good. You're crazy. This is good for your bones. No, it actually increases calcium level and produces mucous. All right. Give it to me. - Yeah. - I'm gonna die of my own mucous. - I have to die of something. - It's worth it. - Cheers. - Cheers to cheese. We tell Franco to bring some down from the Alps next time for me. I want to send it to some clients. How's that going, man? You get the people to take the leap? Not exactly but, I'm working on them, doping hints, you know, sending them little samples... Are you going to be Tom's client? Actually no. We already discussed it. We think it's healthier this way. Yeah, it's better this way. Keep things separate but... you know, maybe sometime in the future. I don't think so. Never, never? But right now it's better that I establish myself on my own. You'll see. She'll be begging me for my business soon. Sure. Maybe you'll finally let me get involved. You know I know my liquors and my wines, right. That means by the AppleJack today, delicious Right? I'm looking to diversify, I could invest some capital. I could help you find some rare and prestigious labels. Okay, maybe. But, maybe not. I'll have to talk to my partner. Your partner, right. Honey, don't start. He's my partner. - You did everything. - Yeah, well he found us our number one investor so as far as am concern, he did he's job already. - Wait, it's Steve, right? - Yeah. I met that guy. He seems great. Great at doing nothing. Honey, will you give the guy a break. He's going thorough a nasty divorce. Sounds like an excuse to me. It's not an excuse. Listen to this. He walks in on his wife sleeping with the neighbor. Now he's got the kids, he's got to move out. He's dealing with a lot of anxiety. - It's fucking brutal. - Yes. A tough situation. Actually, I wish I could do more for him. - Really? - Yeah. I just don't understand this. - You constantly defending him... - Okay, am not... I'm not defending him. He walked in on his wife, fucking the neighbor, what else is there to say? You make it sound so black and white, Tom. It's not. The man obviously has his flaws. She didn't wake up one morning and started fucking the neighbor. The truth is always in between. - Yeah, in between her legs. - Yeah, thank you. Exactly. He has a "not believe" who is calling me right now. - Who is that? - Can't tell you. - Come on, man. - He's fucking huge. And he's always asking me to rep his kids. No fucking way. You know what? My number one rule is: no kids! Baby can you, please, turn the sound off? Your like a broken record, Susan! Are you thick? I'm waiting for Ray! Right? Fuck! What was I talking about? - Some famous actor... - Right... Look, actors are like kids, right. So you can imagine having to rep a child actor. No fucking way. It's the last thing I need. Some snot knows kid and his parents telling me what to do. Fuck off. I understand why actors are like kids. They have to be raw. Vulnerable, in touch with their emotions. That's why kids are such fantastic actors. When you see them in movies, their creativity is so free and effortless. I love kids. They always amaze me. - I'm sorry. - What? No. Guys, I didn't mean to... Nooo, don't be silly. Anna? Are you still thinking of firing your GM? Jack? What? Your firing Jack? Well, am figuring it out. I'm trying to see if he can handle the stress and the responsibility but honestly the idea of interviewing people is making me anxious. Honey, you just expect too much from him. Hire somebody else to work the door... The door? The door is important, Tom. You don't just hire a random colleague student looking for a part time job. Jack is great. Everyone loves him, but sometimes he gets in his head and he just... he can't think straight. See, Joe, my idea could work. Yeah. You know I think you are genius. - I'm genius. - What is it? I've been reading many articles and interviews about how high levels of anxiety decrease productivity but in 30 minutes you can, actually, rebalanced yourself. And turn the negative energy into positive. So, I created this little package, where I offer my services and teach you how to do that. I have to say she's always preparing my package with her services and it definitely makes me more productive. Can you quite with all the pro magnum male bullshit and be serious? - I am serious. - Well, I don't like it. Me neither. I just said something good about you, good and true. It's annoying and degrading. You know what? Fuck it. I will have that drink. And I will have you to come and fung shai the restaurant. Hey, that's my girl. It's so draining. See, am telling you. - You just need a break. - It's my life. And I love it. I just wish I didn't have to be on the floor all the time. Double checking thing. You can talk to Jack, and I can focus on other things. Is something burning? - Huh? - Did you turn the oven off? Oh, shit. Jesus, can't you do one fucking thing right? - Let me help you. - Look at this. You wanna burn down the fucking house? Really? Now, our food is gone. I like it crispy. You sure? - Hey. You wanna get high? - Fuck yeah. We can order some pizza's. I thought we didn't want to eat cheese. Don't worry about it for today. All right and I want mushroom. Everybody is fine with mushroom. Anna? Yeah. I don't fucking care. I don't like mushroom but I'll get it for you guys. Let's call the new place and get a grandma. - You call them. - I'll call. Fuck! He can't do anything right. I swear to God he makes me wanna fucking scream. If everything was perfect we would all be robots. From pain comes pleasure, vice versa. Well, yeah, it seems like mostly pain to me. Wish he could just act like a fucking grown up for once. Man, they show us what we wanna see first to impress us. Then we fall in love, they slowly start changing, they back to being two year olds. Then we shouldn't get married. I don't think marriage makes the difference. Just women are more mature. - I need a real fucking man. - Oh, you have one. Hey, you may be going through a rough time but he's under a lot of pressure, too. It's a big decision you made. It's a grown up decision. And Tom adores you. Love isn't the fucking point here. And I don't think it was such a grown up decision. He left a good job, he was making good money. And he left it to chase a silly fucking dream. Tom's a dreamer, that's part of who he is. Tom needs a reality check. Oh, you know what they say? When you are pointing the finger at someone there are three fingers pointing back at you. - I never heard that. - I know but am the same. We are both really good at pointing the finger. I think the woman in general are. But it's just because we are smarter. Right? That's a good point. Okay, let's do this. Let's try to focus on the positive side. Those two aren't always idiots, right. Just most of the time but not always. I do love, Joe. He's funny and... strong and smart, but he's also so quick to react and always inappropriate, I don't know. I'm not easy either. - Our two Benjamin Buttons. - Yeah. Nobody's perfect. - Not them, not us. - I know. I just feel like I have nobody I can talk to. - Well, am here. I don't even know where to begin. Still like every fucking thing that I do is wrong. I'm spiraling down, I can't make it stop, I feel like I've reach... - ...rock bottom. - Great. You should celebrate that. 'Cause from the bottom there is just one way to go. It's up. I'm lying to myself and to my husband. Oh, you know, we all have secrets. It's natural. There's this client of mine, she's been married for 62 years. She told me; "Suzy, you have to have secrets to keep your relationship spicy. - She's so funny. - I don't know about that. Things are pretty messy. My body... I even feel like a cranky old lady. - I can test your chakras. - What? Yes. Do you want? - Sure. - Your gonna feel much better. You'll see. Okay. - Lefty? - Lefty. Okay. On the seventh, this is the seventh chakra. All your strength in here, am gonna try to open it. - Okay. Are you ready? - Okay. Yeah. Okay. Very good. The sixth one. - If the see us. Very good. Now the fifth one. You gonna feel much better. - You'll see. - Oh, that's impossible. Don't say that. It doesn't exist. Break the word down. I am possible. - I like that. - I know. - Repeat after me. I am possible. - I am possible. Okay, the fifth one is weak. But am not surprised. It's because you're not saying something. - Do you have a sore throat? - Actually, I do. It's even hard to swallow. Do you think that's what it is? Oh, yes. So the sore throat is because you are not communicating, and the swallowing is because you can't let it go. You can't accept it. Don't be afraid, Anna. Tom is a very sensitive man. He's always gonna be there ready to support you, and be on your side. Maybe that's what am afraid of. Let's go ahead. Let's check your heart. It's the fourth one You're ready? Don't check the heart, that's... Well you never know. - There are always surprises. - It might not be beating. All your strength here, okay... Oh, man. She's gonna give me such a a hard time, man. You got to give her your hard time. - I'm serious. - So, am I, man. You guys need to have a baby. I mean... Don't give up hope. A baby could fix everything. You know, that's the worst possible thing to say to someone who's miserably failed in trying to have kids, right. I'm just saying, keep on, keep it on. What is that? What does that mean? Sounds like fucking bumper sticker. Did you try that trick I told you? - Yeah, we tried everything. - It works. It worked for my brother. You cum and then you got to scooch her ass up in the air and you got to... ...grab her by the ankles, hold her upside down, make sure she doesn't get too light headed. Actually, haven't tried that one. Seriously, though, you got to fuck on. Are you fucking a lot? Because every chance you get, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, even when you don't feel like it. Sometimes, Susan and me... - Yeah... - ...get into a fight, we have great, aggressive, rough sex, forget what we were fighting about. Well, Anna is definitely not Susan. I know but am just saying but you should try it. It worked for us. We haven't been exactly very active lately. It's not good Tommy. No, it's not good. We used to have sex all the time. Everywhere. And now it's like... ...once a month. Maybe. And she doesn't even seem that into it. I love her but she is... Not making it easy, man. You are a patient man. I would have lost my shit by now. Yeah... Well, maybe she's having an affair. What? No way. Anna's not that type of girl, man. We love each other. You can't brake that bond. - I know, I know. - We are trying to have kids. Maybe it's becoming a bit too much, you know. No, no, no, no. No, it's not. I know. But what if she did break that bond? - She wouldn't. - No, no, neither would Susan. But am just saying, you know. I think about it. I mean what if, What if, you caught her with the next door neighbor, you know, like with what happened with your buddy Steve. - With Mr. Shwarz? - Yeah. - Have you seen this guy? - No. - She'll be shit out of luck. Might be her fantasy, dude. That's pretty funny, actually. No, but seriously man. - What? - What would we do? What if? You really want to play this game? - Yeah, yeah. You first. - Really? Yeah. If I caught Anna sleeping with another man, - what would I do? - What would you do? Okay. Well, shit. This would depend on few things. Such as... Such as, whose the guy. Where they doing it? How are they doing it? - What is she wearing? - What is she wearing? Well, am not finished. How long have they been doing it for? Look, look. If she was sleeping with a good looking guy, with a hard body, I'll be less likely to kill, maybe even understanding of it. - What? Why? - Yeah, because it shows, that she still has good taste. And that she can attract a handsome young gentlemen. I would be way more pissed off if she was fucking some ugly bad ass. That makes, absolutely, no sense. Makes perfect sense. Next, where they doing it? This is not as important, as who is she's doing it with, obviously but still, it's major. I would factor this in. Because, if they were sleeping in a place where we did it all the time, that would drive me deep shit. But if they were just, if they did it in a place where we only done it a couple of times, that would ease the pain. - Yeah. - You know. What about if... What about if they're doing it in a fucking kinky position? - Like you guys never doing it? - Yeah, the how, that would, also, piss me off but it's not as much as were they doing it. If I caught some son of a bitch, sleeping with my Anna, in our special place, am telling you, I would scalp that mother fucker with the quickness. - Serious business. What's a special place? I can't tell you that. - Oh, come on, man. - No, some things are personal. Come on. Okay. - It's at the restaurant I come in and I would pretend am the last customer you know, do a little role playing. - Yeah. - And we would just start fucking. And am talking about everywhere. I'm talking about, in a walk in freezer. I'm talking about on top of the register, on tables, on the counters, everywhere. If the health inspector ever found out about it, - she'll be shut down for sure. - I am never eating there again. - What about you, man? - What about the outfit thing? - Oh, the outfit. - Yeah. Okay, I love lingerie. - You love lingerie, right. - Neh... - What? - Neh... Everybody loves lingerie. You're weird if you don't. I got to, fucking, beg her to wear it. She's all the time; "What, you don't find me attractive without all that trashy stuff on? Fucking absurd, right. So, if I found out that she's banging some handsome young gentlemen in the walk in fridge, while she's wearing a lingerie... Go get fire engine ready in point zero seconds. Fuck. Yeah, I hear you. I hear you. But, but... You got to consider the flip side, right. I mean, you... Yeah... ...would be free to fuck other women. This is true. But, you know, the dating scene has changed a lot with the apps, and websites. That seems like a lot of drama. Really? Truth is, I love her, man. So, what about you? She's married to me. I'll be cool with it. What would you be cool with? Jesus, ears like a hawk. - Spying on us. - I'm not spying Mr. Paranoid. Oh, my God, that's so good. Yeah, Joe, tell her what you'll be cool with. Just tell her. No need. What were you guys talking about? What were you guys talking about? Like am gonna answer. 'Cause I'm sure your conversation is much more - interesting the ours. - We were talking about how immature you two are and how sometimes I just wanna scream - and run away. - Oooo... Ouch, yeah, okay. Our conversation was more interesting than that. Yeah. You wanna know what we were talking about? What would we do if we found out that our spouses were cheating on us. Yeah, what would you do, Suzy Q? If you were cheating on me? Oh, no. That's stupid. Really? You never thought about it? Come on. If you trying to be funny, it's not working. I'm not... Who's trying to be funny? I'm not trying to be funny. You asked us what we talked about, I tell you what we talked about. What you are talking about? Joe is this your stupid idea? You always telling me to share and be more communicative, - and there you go. - I have no problem sharing or being communicative. Well, I do. Well, you shouldn't. This is a safe environment. You want drink? - I don't think it's a good idea. - It's a very good idea. Why don't you guys wait to eat some food first? Why? So we can be communicative? This is been nice but I think am gonna go and lay down now. Everybody gather around the table, we gonna hold hands - and meditate. - You got smoked. You freaking high? Let's play the game. I like games. What would you do if you caught your spouse with someone else? - Let me go, let me go. - Tommy's first. I've already thought about this. Okay? If I found out... If I found out that you, Anna, were sleeping with another man, this would depend on some things, now. Like what? Okay. Who is this fucker? Where you fucking him? What... This was horrible idea. Why did you bring this up? No. Now I wanna hear. Oh, now you do? - Now, I do. - Well, I don't. And I am not a fucking robot. All right? Do this, do that, don't do that, don't do this... You do whatever the fuck you want, anyway. Oh, guys, come on. - This is getting good. - This is getting really good. I can even swallow now. That's what she said. Joe, shut the fuck up. Hey, everybody calm down. I am calm. And I am seeing very clearly now. Oh, yeah? - 'Cause you know it all? - No! I just happen to know a lot of shit and you don't. Tom, are you gonna say something? Yeah. I'm going to. Well, am sorry... okay? I'm sorry... ...sorry am not born into a reach family like you. - Self made man. That's right. I'm a self made man, motherfucker. Yeah, and we are all here celebrating your future failure, because that's exactly what it is. Get a reality check. - Let's take a deep breath. - No, no, Susan. This is good. Her real colors have finally come out. - Keep it coming, baby. - More AppleJack for everybody. You need to stop fucking drinking. No, he's my friend. He knows me. He's your friend? I'm just saying what everybody here is fucking thinking, Tom. But you all are too afraid to tell him because he's so nice and you don't want to hurt his feelings! Well am sick and tired being married to a man with no balls. Would you listen to the poison coming out of this one's mouth? - I can have another one. - Your poisonous. - Have another one. - No wonder you can't bear a goddam child. Fuck you. Hey, fuck me. For the record, somebody really likes this man with no balls. She respects me, she doesn't give a shit how much fucking money I make. And she wears lingerie, and she lets me fuck her in the ass. Boom! What did you say? I said I cheated on you. - Oh, fuck. - We should leave. No, Susan, stay. I was just getting to the past part here. What the fuck are you talking about? - I wanna go home. - It's okay. I'm sorry, Joe. Man, good for you. Why are you apologizing to Joe? Because I got something to say. Scusi, Suzy. No. Everybody needs to hear this. I'm at the top of the mountain, I'm gonna let it all out. - What the fuck are you talking about? Susan and I, had an affair. Oh, shit. What? You, you and who? Susan and I... ...we had an affair. - Fuck! - Joe! - Goddammit! God, you just said you'll be cool with it. We were "what ifing" and I was fucking lying. Jesus Christ! How could you do that? You are like a brother to me. I can't fucking believe that. - Un-fucking-real. - That's fucking disgusting. Your fucking disgusting. Well, you can't walk away from it. Can not fucking believe you. - Believe it. - You can't blame just him. Are you defending him? You two had an affair. No, it only happened twice. - No, it was three times. - Tom! Shut the fuck up! How many times did you screw him? - It was something that... - How many times, - goddammit? - Three times! - Jesus Christ! - We were both looking for someone that could listen to us! We couldn't find it with you, guys. Your both working all the fucking time. It's tough. So, you decided to take it in the ass? It just happened at the right time. Shut the fuck up! - This is a nightmare. - Well, it happened. It would have been worse if we wouldn't have done it. Are you listening to yourself, Susan? - Please, try to focus... - I can't focus. - He fucked you in the ass. - Joe! Focus! Okay! It's cool! We were... There were sexual tension, now we are friends. - It's better this way. - I am gonna throw up. Now we have each other understandings how much - we love you, guys. - Shut the fuck up! - You fucked my wife in the ass? - Stop saying that, please. She doesn't even let me fuck her in the ass. Take it as a compliment? How could? How could either of you... Anna, I know it's hard. Try to breath for once... - Don't fucking tell me... - If you come in with your goddam and try your new age bullshit, Susan, am going to explode. Recognize that your ego is talking right now. Your ego is hurt. Maybe you should listen to her. I see, your dick going in her ass. That's all I can see. We can decide to come out of this and we learn something. Our marriage can grow. She's right. Our marriage can grow, baby. How the fuck? How the fuck can our marriage grow? I love you, Joe. - Please... - How can you say that to me? It's true! You need to let yourself be vulnerable with me. We can climb this mountain together. All this pain, that now seems unbearable, is gonna be a gift. A gift from God! I wouldn't bring up God. I don't know why I said that. Please, listen to me. We can take the challenge, and make something more beautiful out of all this. Oh, my God. You are fucking delusional. - No, my love. - Yes. Don't call me your love. No, don't be afraid. Don't judge yourself. I am gonna throw up. Please, just stay with me. Just listen... - Get the fuck away from me. - Don't push her, please. You both betrayed us and you act like it's nothing. I'm so glad you're not freaking out about this. I think you should let it out. It feels good... I'm pregnant! You? You what? She's pregnant! She's pregnant! Shut the fuck up, Schwartz! Let's all clam down a second. Oh, my God! This is amazing! When did you found out? In hour or so ago. Really? Why didn't you tell me, baby? I was confused. Joe open the window. - It's time that we left. - No, it's time we talk. - Suzy get your coat. - Let Anna talk. - I'm leaving. - Joe, you're not going anywhere. Who gives a shit? He is the father. Whose father? Of the baby. - Of my baby? - It's not yours. How is that possible? Sex! Tom, sex! We've been doing it everywhere for the past ten months. - Is she having your baby? - No! How can you say that? - I was feeling guilty... - Yeah, you should feel guilty... You didn't even use protection! I'm shocked! This is not real! - This is not happening! - I was so stupid! I didn't intend to go this far. I believed everything you say. I'm so stupid. You... You two laying pieces of shit! Kettle black! Kettle black! - 10 months! - Oh, gosh! We only hand out every fucking week. I bet you were laughing at us. - Susan, please. - Please, what? Where? Where did you had sex? - What difference does it make? - You don't get to decide. Makes a huge fucking difference. We were fucking everywhere. - It doesn't matter. - It matters to me. Where did you had sex? It doesn't matter, Tom. Susan, sometime things happen in life, right? Hey! Hey! Come on! I need to take that call. - Susan, come on. - Come on, nothing! You have nothing to say to me? You are a coward. Just like your buddy, Tom. You are wrong, Anna. - She's right. - No, she's not. Then, who are you, Mr. Hollywood? You are fucking back stabber! We are all fucking back stabbers! But am the one that's pregnant. A fucking... ...a fucking baby. A fucking baby! What do you want to do? - I don't know. - I thought I wanted to have - a child. - That's what I always wanted. What are you talking about? No, I don't fucking love him. Anna, stop! Breathe! Don't say things you can't take back! - I'm leaving. - I'm leaving. I'm the one who doesn't have a place here. Don't touch me! I thought since I did it once, I can just keep doing it. One time or hundred times. What's the difference? Sorry. I didn't... I didn't tell you the truth because I was terrified that if I did, I was gonna lose you. You think sex is the problem for me? Lies are! You not telling me the truth. Now, you know the truth. Not all of it. What? There's more? I can't... I can't give you a baby. I can't have children. You shoot blanks? I... I can't give you a baby. And I am not... - Mr. Hollywood shoots blanks. - Shut the fuck up! I am not the father, of your baby, Anna. How the fuck... How long have you known for? 10 years ago, I couldn't conceive with my ex wife, it ruined our first marriage and... I didn't want that to happen to us. So, I lied. You should have just told me. That is fucking bullshit. Come on, really. You're just... You're just trying to turn this around. - Yeah. - Yeah. Well, I would probably try to do that but am not. I'm telling the truth and I have proof. Believe it or not. So, am the father? Please, tell me he's the only ass who you been fucking. I am not gonna answer that. You couldn't get pregnant. So you just decide to sleep around? Are you calling me a whore? - I didn't say that. - No, because you don't have the courage to fucking say that. Oh, like you with the board? Oh, stop. There you go, twisting things again. Am not twisting, just stating the fact. Your stating dreams. - Is there any difference? - I should have just fucking push you overboard. I should choke you and watch you drown. Look at me. I fucking hate it. I fucking hate it. I lied, Anna. You were never in my dreams. - Oh, Tom, don't... - Susan, shut the fuck up! No wonder he stopped fucking you. You speak and nothing but fucking bullshit comes out of your mouth. Your nothing but a hippie freak begging for fucking love. - Hey, Susan. That's what she wanted. Don't cry, Anna. We should be happy. We are finally cleansed. Back to zero with an opportunity. It's up to us. We can decide to keep sleeping or we wake up.
