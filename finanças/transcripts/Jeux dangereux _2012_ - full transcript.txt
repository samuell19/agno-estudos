NATURAL SELECTION Mr Brecht! Mr Brecht! Give us the documents. and you'II be fine! Mr Brecht! You two go that way. You. come with me. So. trying to escape? Stop that. sweetheart. you'II crumple it. The scent of hot steam - I don't know if I can resist... Sandrine. I'm really late. I've got to go. You're very stressed. Look how tense you are. That's not good at all! Jesus! You're dangerous. - Whoops. - Shit. that's my parents' couch. You'II pay for that. In hospitals. schools. and public places. the primary carriers of infection are... the hands. After the palm of the hand. which transmits innumerable viruses. the next greatest carrier is... the door handle. - What Corpus offer... - No. no. No good at all. We need to see it happen. Geoffroy. we've already talked this through. You're not feeling it. You go too fast at the end. Build the suspense. How. can humanity be saved? What is this miracle cure? Then. you go for it. The hands-free... handle. A bit full-on. isn't it? - No. - Oh. okay. Stupid thing... Damn it! I think it hates me. That's the third time this week. Don't take this badly. but I don't think it'II work. tomorrow's presentation. You're not ready. I know I promised you. But it's too risky - for us. Our necks are on the line. - Don't do this to me. I don't know why you're being stubborn. You're a great engineer. Technically. you're way better than me. But for a businessman. you're too... You're too touchy. ''Touchy''? That's it. touchy. ''Touchy''! - Corpus. hello? - Antonin Brecht? I wanted to wish you good luck - for tomorrow's presentation. - Excuse me? That door handle - you designed it. didn't you? Yes. Mr Brecht. a talent like yours is too rare to go unnoticed. I'm sorry. but who is this? Jean-Baptiste Pirelli. One-For-One Agency. One of my clients is interested in your profile as an ergonomic engineer. I'm not interested. thanks. I hadn't offered anything. yet. - Goodbye. - Mr Brecht! Don't you think it's time you broke free of your limits? Goodbye. Sir. See you soon. Mr Brecht. Who was it? A head-hunter. Interested in my profile. We're the perfect team. Antonin. Our strength comes from each knowing our limits. and being able to count on each other. They call it ''symbiosis'' - and you can't buy that. Hi. C?cile. - Isn't Sandrine here? - Not yet. She said you were at the office. and would be late. That's slander. - How's the menagerie? - Charlotte! - Where's their father? - Working. As usual! - How's things. sweetie? - Not bad. Does your client know his piano's not locked up? Manu and Samir have gone. - I can't deliver it myself. - What if it's stolen? In Saint-Denis. nobody touches Abdu's truck. It's called respect. - Okay. - To respect. Why don't you tell him? We talked about it. He thinks I can't sell myself. What does that mean. ''sell yourself''? It's all you ever hear. We're not products. But he's right - if you don't grow. you regress. Tell that to your henchmen. then maybe they'II work Sundays. Abdu Removals has a bright future. they just don't get it! It's like those head-hunters. We had one earlier on. Pirelli something-or-other. who called at home to ask if I was ready to support your new career. What a nerve. - You could've told me. - It slipped my mind. Are you tempted? It's just nice to know what you're worth. Like a progress report. Hang on - ''what you're worth''. or ''what you want''? - Hi. guys. - Hi. Guillaume. - Daddy! - It's your turn. AIready? Great party! Looking good! Obviously bacteria is carried by the hands. as we all know. So Corpus has developed the UIna system. This system allows you to increase your establishment's hygiene. by allowing you to open and close doors... hands-free. It's simple. polypropylene plastic. mass-produced. in a colour of your choice. You can see the range. here. And I'm delighted to have with me this object I cherish so much - the hands-free handle. Follow me. Please. Gabriel. you're an adult now. Your mother's already given you an answer. and I agree with her. I know you're disappointed. That sounds sensible. Wise decision. Comfort. Ieisure... I never accept anyone who chooses that couch. It's all there. in the choice between those who settle down. and relax. and those who stay alert. ready to act. But... ergonomics say that comfort and efficiency go together. You still chose the chair. I have one guiding principle. Mr Brecht - movement equals profit. My competitors have learned nothing from this recession. But I've decided to streamline the market. Streamline the market? Somewhere in one of the companies I recruit for. there's a man who's un-motivated. a woman who's incompetent. I'm not judging them. it's just a simple fact. I diagnose the problem. free up the post. and I put you forward for it. as you're right for the job. That's the idea of One-For-One. ''One man for one job''. I don't really want to move jobs. I just came out of curiosity. You'd rather line the pockets of Geoffroy Treille. Well. I certainly respect - your selflessness. - No. I've grown up with Corpus. - I owe them everything. - Quite the opposite. Corpus owes you. And your boss knows it. He's holding you back. ready to fire you at any moment. If the firm gets into trouble. he wouldn't think twice. - Take it from me. - I don't think Mr Treille... You're passive. It's your choice. I just hope it doesn't put you at odds with your social circle. Sometimes our loved ones have other plans for our lives. I don't have that problem. and I certainly don't appreciate you calling my partner. You're right. Sandrine. isn't it? She stood right by you. Absolutely. Not at all interested in your social progression. Mr Pirelli. forgive me... I've embarrassed you. You're uncomfortable. modest... and loyal. AII to your credit. But perhaps. they're also holding you back. Listen to your ambition. Antonin. What's wrong with that? Without ambition. we'd still be dumb. fearful apes. shaking with fear in our caves. Tell me your dream job. and I'II make it yours. Tonight. I've prepared a tasting menu. Wow. what are we celebrating? Are you pregnant? Here's the scan. Remember the recruitment agent who phoned you? Pirelli. at One-For-One? He's offered me a job - as Head of Ergonomics at Magellan. - What. the construction people? - They do ergonomics? - More and more. It's really profitable. Is it what you want? I can't turn down an opportunity like this. not in a recession. Nice to see you're happy for me! No. I am happy. Should I dance on the table? Nothing's signed. I wanted to tell you first. But I have to admit. I'm really tempted. And the paycheck... - Don't rub it in. - But the best part is. Magellan rent company apartments at reduced rates. right by the office. So they can keep an eye on you. We've already tried Saint-Denis. I just don't know if I'm ready for urban living. You know me. I'm a country girl. And Geoffroy? We did it. Antonin! The hands-free handle is in the bag. 1 O.OOO units in the first year. plus a renewal contract. This is huge! Good - you'II be able to hire my replacement. Yeah. sure! I'm leaving. Geoffroy. I'm going to Magellan. You're kidding me. We've won the deal. I said. We'II be able to expand. just like we've always wanted. I know it's not easy to accept that someone's outgrown you. What are you talking about? You can grow as much as you like. here. You think I don't trust you? - Do I pick on you? - No. no. But it'II always be your place. with me coming second. I think it's about money. Just as we're about to earn lots of it. You never were a businessman. - You don't understand. - No. I don't. Why would you go somewhere like Magellan. who put profit before everything else. sacrificing quality and safety? I know it's tempting. Things aren't easy at the moment. Budgets are shrinking. the competition's getting more vicious. But don't do this. Antonin. They'II squeeze you like a lemon. And when you're wrung dry. they'II throw you away. It's signed. I start Monday. I'II fetch my things this weekend. Geoffroy. we're separating. but you're still my friend. I'm not so sure. Antonin! - Antonin! - Beno?t! Sorry. I'm in a rush. Has Corpus sold its soul? No. just me. I'm taking over ergonomics at Magellan. So. you've got Martin-Girard's old job. - Welcome to the big time! - Thanks. Make sure you check your brake pads. - What? - Didn't you hear? Martin-Girard ploughed into a toll-booth on the A-1 3. His cruise control was stuck at 1 30mph. Career over. 1 4 injured. two dead. Never did things by halves... I had no idea. He was starting to lose his marbles. Must have mixed the pedals up. Still. it worked out well for me. But with you as competition. it'II be more tense. Did Pirelli hire you? Well. I have to go. It's my first day. That Pirelli's good. though! Is he taking 1 O percent of everything you make. too? Get this - in five years. he's moved me up two income brackets. I crushed everything in my way. Five years flat out. just to do that. Now I'm taking a break. The wife wants another kid. and I hardly see - the other two... - I really have to go. Yeah. Let's do lunch. one of these days. No problem. Mr Brecht. Welcome to Magellan. Here's your activated badge. You can go anywhere in the building. And your phone. The number's on the back. Consini. the Director General. is expecting you. Thank you. - I won't stand for this. - You're exaggerating. Consini. You know I'm not. Sir. Antonin Brecht. Consini. I was against such a quick replacement. It's unnecessary. Especially with someone so... Anyway. I wasn't consulted. I was sorry to hear about Martin-Girard. Gr?goire was my friend. I don't like vultures. He was working on renovations for a chain of abattoirs. Big budget. But without him. we might as well drop it. - Can I see the file? - It's on your desk. The owners want to close the French site. because of labour costs. You have three days to convince them to stay. And. since Magellan can't afford to lose this commission. I suspect we won't be working together long. WELCOME TO MAGELLAN. THE FUTURE IS OURS. What does he think he's doing? Do you think you could use those shelves? Yeah. probably. Are you sure? Yes. The new place has plenty. - Well. okay. - Here. Actually. I will take your dishwasher. Mine's not really working. We can probably do the rest in one trip. I'II just need one guy. Didn't Antonin tell you? The move's been organised by his company. They have their own people. Right. Of course. Talk to him. maybe he can get you the work. I don't know why he never told you. It's okay. Don't worry him with it. He has a lot on his mind. Wait. Iet me help you. Here. Well. then? What's got into you? I know you'II miss us. but still! It's sad. moving house. Everything that's happened here... And it shows! It helps if you clean up. around things. So much for female solidarity! I didn't mean you. It was meant for Antonin. - the old lazybones. - You aren't much better. Seven months' training. Then. within three years. they leave - due to muscle problems. - Hardly surprising. Same thing. if they move site. Except there. they're not afraid of occupational medicine. Edwige. do you have a physiological report? That's Fanny's job. I take care of the engineering. with Simon. Oh. that's right. It's all here. The problem is their repetitive movements. Okay. So the firm needs to make its workforce profitable without working them to death. The workers aren't a variable. They just pick. - and throw. - Unless we prove the opposite. It's just not profitable. Well. not in realistic terms. - Realistic. how? Marc. isn't it? - Yeah. Marc. I have to convince the client that it's profitable from day one. so... With the crisis. I'm afraid that your five-year plan... Most don't know if they even have one year. So everyone's outsourcing. I should hire Romanians to do your job. It would be cheaper. Ergonomics are a winning investment. If I wasn't sure of it. I wouldn't be here. So we overhaul the entire labour structure. we dissect it. and find the margin. Then Marc can relax! Hello. Antonin. I wasn't expecting to see you here. You'd better get used to it. L?once Magellan has been a friend ever since I started One-For-One. I look after him. I gather Consini's already putting the pressure on? He's not exactly delighted I'm here. Still. it can't be easy - Martin-Girard was his friend. You never told me - that he'd died. - Why. are you superstitious? It's okay. I'II make it work. - ''Make it work''? - Learn to get along with him. No. you'II never do that. Consini knows you're a threat to his job. Wait. am I missing something? It's him or you. I'm just anticipating. Yeah. that's good. Antonin. Antonin? - Yeah? - What do you think? Yep. Great. You don't care? No. I do - but it's bound to move. We'II have new furniture. - it'II change everything. - What's wrong with ours? Oh. nothing - just look at that one. The prize exhibit! That's not ours. Present from Mr Magellan. - What can I say? - Your old set. shall we take it? Okay. go ahead. - Thank you. - Good bye. They weren't here. - last time. - They're moving in. like us. So. where's your office? We can signal to each other. ''Darling. make my dinner. I'm coming home!'' Do you understand this one? Now listen here... Here. or in a low-cost country. the problem's the same: how to make employees profitable. once they're fully trained. Our answer comes from an activity analysis. We've re-thought the working environment. A complete renovation of the ergonomic process will improve both their working conditions. and their efficiency. It pays off long-term. because your employees won't burn out in three years. That's all great. but I won't get my 5 percent margin unless I relocate. Excuse me. but it's quite clear on the report. If I may... Can I borrow your knife? - And my coat. too? - That's okay. Imagine... If there was a packaging line just here. I could cut the meat. while performing another related task. Meaning I regain my balance. biomechanically. No more musculoskeletal problems. faster turnover. and a 20 percent productivity increase. - Are you on this. too? - Times are hard. We're like rats. - fighting for cheese. - You okay? - Why? Aren't you? - Yeah. yeah. - Still learning. - They won't leave me alone. I'II end up like that guy. A big shot. contracted by Pirelli. He refuses a promotion. goes through hell. alcohol. depression. Wife leaves. Now he's sleeping under bridges. Seriously! Do you see me under a bridge? What an idiot. It's all just rumours. to make us work harder. AIways more! - AIways more. - What's Pirelli thinking? I have mouths to feed. I have other priorities. And plenty of them. - See you later. - Ciao. You refuse a housewarming with our friends. and now we're doing it - with your colleagues. - It's just dinner. So. they're your new friends? No. but we've won the contract with the abattoirs. - It's a team celebration. - Abattoirs? - I had no idea. - I told you 15 times! And the housewarming. I told you - we'II do it! - No need to be angry. So this isn't a housewarming. Fine. Really. you're just bringing your work home. How do I look? Like a good little boss' wife? I'II show you who's the boss! Hello. I'm Sandrine. Mr Brecht's partner. Hello. Fanny. - This is from all of us. - Thank you. Hello. Edwige. Nice to meet you. Hello. Marc. - Hello. - Hello. Simon. - Nice to meet you. It's for the apartment. - We thought that... - It's a bit like a housewarming. Exactly. It's wonderful. You shouldn't have. It's really nice. Thank you. Slightly overcooked. wasn't it? They thought you'd made it. so they all had seconds. - You're such a pain. - Excuse me? It's almost like you enjoy it. Give me a break. will you? We move because of your job. I never see you on weekends. and instead of seeing our friends. we talk about - your job! - Just let me find my feet. I never thought it would bother me. I even threw a customer out - of the bookshop. - Stop pressurising me. or I'II never get through it. It's like you want me to fail. - Where are you going? - To find my feet. Antonin. Throw me a coat. it's freezing. Stop it. will you. Come up. No. I'm a pain. Please. I'm sorry. Do you love me? Hush! Okay. I love you! I'II come up. He didn't want to leave. so you killed him! You won't get away with it. I'II tell everyone! Get off! I didn't ask you. It'II happen to you too! Even the small-fry. they'II get it! - Leave me alone. - Who's that? Martin-Girard's widow. If he could see her now... Mr Magellan tried to help her. He was very generous. People love to blame their company. If something goes wrong. it's the company. - If they feel alone... - Thanks. How did it go. yesterday? ...this commission is really important. Brecht! I'm counting on you. We need it tomorrow. no hiccups. - I'II meet the deadline. - Thanks. How's Mond'Axe going? - I'm working on it. - That wasn't my question. - Any solutions? - Don't worry. my team's on it. This is more than a couple of shitty abattoirs - it's Mond'Axe. the world's biggest delivery service 1 5.OOO branches. 14.375. I know. I'II keep you posted. Consini... I had nothing to do with... May I ask what you're in my office? Nora Merteuil. your new assistant. News to me. I was transferred from management. They told me to settle in. so as not to waste time. You're the boss. If you don't want me... Nora. was it? We're on a big project. so I won't have time - to help you. - Mond'Axe? Yeah. That's my priority. Don't worry. I can work by myself. Just one thing. Sir. Do you have a list of priority names. so I can field your calls? Filter them depending on what they want. Except Sandrine. Your wife? No. but she may as well be. Hello. Oh. hi. Abdu. Yeah. not bad. The apartment's great. It's all fine. ''The high life''? Well. I suppose it must be. Everyone seems to want it. Antonin. home on a Saturday? No such thing anymore. He's sometimes here on Sunday afternoons. Yeah. that's probably it. Anyway. how are you? I'm serious. So with no warning. they hire you an assistant? - Isn't it weird? - Yes. She's very good. but I didn't appreciate it. No kidding. I don't know if I'II keep her. So. you don't have to answer this. but... are you on Mond'Axe. too? Why? Are they taking bids? Leave it. Express delivery is my game. I know it inside out. I'm presenting tomorrow. The game's not over yet. Well. Iook who's moving up in the world! I remember when you were the resident geek at Corpus. and now here you are... Sorry. just playing with you. We get on well. One commission isn't going to change that. May the best man win. Okay? May the best man win. And Pirelli? - Is he cutting you slack? - Pirelli... He does his job. I do mine. Fanny? I want everyone in the lab at 2pm. We're re-doing it. No. I don't like it. Otherwise we wouldn't be re-doing it. Yeah. That's what I'm here for. Your calls. Sorry. I'm not used to it. Hello. Antonin. Mr Pirelli. One-For-One Agency. Nora. my assistant. So. you're having trouble with Mond'Axe ? Not at all. That's not what I heard. Consini? And others. Did you know that stress can promote development. and performance? A threatened animaI is capable of extraordinary feats. So are humans. Provided they don't lapse into guilt. and repentance - negative stress. which paralyses. and turns you against yourself. I hope you don't intend to fail. Just as well. See you soon. I'd heard all about him. but never seen him. I was starting to think he didn't exist. Are you okay. Mr Brecht? Antonin. See you next week-end... - I haven't seen Geoffroy. - He's not doing well. Still recovering. What? You asked. TOMORROW 7.30AM IN MY OFFICE - You've got good hearing. - Sorry. Hi. Nora. I just got a mail from Consini. What's it about? Mond'Axe. is that it? How can he know we've lost? The decision's tomorrow. Okay. fine. Sorry. See you tomorrow. Shall we dance? Go on. - You okay? - Yeah. - And with Sandrine ? - It's fine. Why? I don't know. She looks spaced out. It must be hard for her. A bigger apartment. better city. - a nicer neighbourhood... - Thanks. - What did I say? - Just take care. will you? You don't look well. - We never see you. - I don't have the damn time. - Not for Sandrine. either? - So. she's complaining to you? Not just me. We're worried for you. I get it - the good friends trying to save the doomed couple. Well. that's great. You can go fuck yourselves. You're out of line. Do you even know what I do? No. you don't care. - You just whine about it! - No. We don't care about your big ambitions. It's about you. Suits you fine. ''Let's stick together. nice and cosy ''in our mediocrity. hating others.'' Why not admit you're jealous? Listen. you need to wake up. Do you think we're worthless. now? - Let's go. I've had it. - No. - Can I sleep here. C?cile ? - Of course. - Is this some kind of plot? - Calm down! She can stay with her friends. can't she? Sure. You know what? Have fun. - See you tomorrow. - No. You don't get it. Antonin. This can't go on. I need some time. Hello. taxi? Stupid fucking suburbs! Your proposal was rejected by Mond'Axe. Too expensive. too restrictive. Basically. you failed. Fortunately. I have some contacts there. I was able to get you a second chance - there'II be three finalists. instead of two. Thank you. I'm not doing this for you. It's for Magellan. One second. I've put my neck on the line to get you out of this. So don't mess it up. You're in my sights. Yeah. hi. No. No. certainly not. Revise the operational language. Leave nothing to chance! Mental and physical structure. Every impact. It all has to be ''plug'n'play''. That's exactly what we concluded. Clearly. it wasn't. Put yourselves in the workers' place. for God's sake! Copy their movements. Feel their exhaustion! That's how we'II get answers. not by navel-gazing! That's it. We'II regroup at 7:30 tonight. And I want results! Don't worry. When you have responsibilities. you sometimes need to shout. But they still like working for you. Shall I write the report? Yes. thank you. Hello. sometimes I'm home. sometimes I'm not. You know me. Leave a message and I might call you back. Sorry. it's me again. I forgot to tell you that the couches have come. You made a great choice. they're a beautiful colour. And the rest. But I haven't tried them. I wanted to wait until we're together. So. that's it. Let me know when you're coming home. Lots of love. - Sir. - Thanks. Thanks. So anyway. I don't see them much anymore. You know. I saw Sandrine in Saint-Denis. She told me a little about your... - Your temporary problems. - ''Temporary''. Don't worry too much. she just needs reassurance. She feels you're becoming distant. She walks out. and I'm the one who's distant? You know it's not that simple. She's at an age where she needs the relationship to progress. Recapture the excitement. A baby - why not? I'd like to. but now's not the time. If she can't see that... Baby or not. that's not the real issue. You need to decide what you want. Can I help? We've got the facts. but I can't fin a good commercial angle. Any idea about the competition's proposals? Nothing. Which means I don't know where to pitch it. And we can't run at a loss. You can go. Nora. - if you like. - Are you sure? You must have things to do. I'm meeting my cousin. but I can canceI if you want me. I mean. for work. And I'm sure you've got things to do. too. Your partner must be waiting. She's a little absent at the moment. Absent? Literally. - Good night. - Good night. It's too soon. - I don't feel capable... - You're perfectly capable of seducing a man - him. or any other. He wants you. Take him. - He's still hung up on her. - I'II take care of that. Don't think too much. just turn him on. The rest will follow. It's human nature. Sandrine? Nora. what the hell are you doing? - I tried to call you. - What is it now? I have information on tomorrow's presentation. That's kind. but I'm in no fit state. I'm not... I'm not focused. mentally. Look - it's the proposal which the client likes most. I don't know which firm. that's confidential. So is this. How did you get it? Nora! My cousin works for Mond'Axe security. Nice cousin! I didn't want to. but when I said what I was working on. he said it was easy. - One quick photocopy... - Great security! He's on the level. but... we're family. so he wanted to help me out. Don't worry. our surnames are different. I like being with you. Well. I mean... I get a lot out ofworking with you. So if this might jeopardise that. I'II take the file back. and it never existed. I suppose you'd better come in. - I don't want to disturb you. - Nothing to disturb. We're closed. Jean-Baptiste Pirelli. One-For-One. We spoke a while ago. on the telephone. - What do you want? - To talk about Antonin. He's not coping well. since you left him. - That's none of your business. - It's my fault. I couldn't explain to him that... that if he kept on that way he risked losing you. and himself. I didn't know you were a therapist. too! Now get out. You have a right to be angry. But then. so do I. You can still save your relationship For me. it's too late. I lost my wife and child in a car crash. after she left me. For the same reasons that you left Antonin. I'm sorry. It's ridiculous. I shouldn't have come here. You should hurry. They've got it. With those materials. manufacturing costs are lower. But less practical. Less adaptable to ergonomic variations - in sorting and delivery. - What a load of hot air! - Sorry. - No. it's okay. I can only see one way to beat the competition. We offer a middle solution that. overall. limits damage. Then we convince the client that it's equally effective. but cheaper. Yes. that works. And the scope statement mentions a negligible drop in quality during the first few years. Will you do the presentation with me? - Don't be silly. - I'm serious. Nora. I've already tried it by myself. But with you on side. - it'II look different. - Different? It'II wake them up. make them curious. I've never done it before. You have to start somewhere. Sorry. I... No. - Was I okay? - Better than that. Well? - Are you here for... - What do you think? Nora. my assistant. Geoffroy. my old colleague. Well. good luck. Oh. sorry! Leave it - thanks. You never told me you were pitching for this. Nor did you. I'd say we had more important things to discuss. I thought it was lunch between friends. But maybe I was wrong. The file you gave me was Corpus' proposal. I had no idea. I removed the company name. It was my cousin's idea. I didn't know he was your ex-boss. Who told you that? You did. when you introduced us. What difference does it make? It was him or us. I wanted it to be us. Otherwise. you'd be fired. Consini can't wait. Never do that again. Okay. chief. Run. Mister. run! Sandrine... Sandrine. listen to me. I love you. Come home. Wouldn't it be crowded - three of us in your new bed? - What are you talking about? - Don't lie. it's even more pathetic. Take responsibility. Be strong! Your guru must have said that. Okay... I was confused. I messed up. I'm sorry. I swear it. I'm sorry. I love you. You've finally become what you wanted - a predator. a cheat. Now. I think perhaps you were always like that. - Stop it. - A fraud. hiding his cards and faking his feelings. And I refused to see it! Fine. I'II stop everything. Is that what you want? I'II resign! You decide. We'II start again. and have a baby. You don't get it. It's over. Antonin. I don't want to see you. Come on! Here it is. Well done. Let's celebrate. - We deserve it. - You were all fantastic. You certainly deserve it. - well done. - To us. Here's our champion! Congratulations. Brecht. I'm glad I supported you. Isn't Nora here? The president had a report that needed writing. I couldn't find you. so I sent Nora. I think you owe her a toast! To us! What's going on? Consini wanted me to denounce you. He wanted me to tell Magellan that the Mond'Axe commission was all down to me. - What did you tell him? - What do you think? To fire you. and hire me instead. Whatever happens between us. I don't want their little schemes to... To... Mrs Martin-Girard. Can I help at all? Can I call you a taxi? AIways more bonuses. more stock options! He couldn't cope with it. Harassed. pushed to the edge. Who was harassing him? Pirelli? - You know him? - He's the one who hired me. I know nothing about the accident. It was no accident. and you know it. You killed him! It's you who killed him! Surprise! What a lovely place you have. - It's wonderful. - Happy birthday. Son. Thanks. How did you know? Your file includes your date of birth. Mr Pirelli was so kind. He sent someone to fetch us from the station. I'II be in the kitchen. - Well. make yourselves at home. - Thanks. - After you. - Thank you. I'II be right there. Can you tell me why the hell Pirelli is here? He called. asking me to organise something for your birthday. He said you were okay about meeting up with the family. Why did he call you? How does he know we're together? I thought you'd told him. I don't need him to introduce you to my parents. I never asked! You did well. Son. At least you won't be trampled underfoot by the Chinks. Please. Dad. not the yellow peril. Have you had problems with Asian people? We had a launderette. and the Chinese ran us out of business. They slashed the prices. It's easy. when you're a family. 1 2 of them. paying the rates for two. Faster and faster. but nobody cares about quality. You see. Son. you need to work hard to beat them. AIways harder. Antonin works very hard already. What my husband means is. we're so happy for him. He seems so confident. Even serene. - Nora's partly to thank. - I'm sure she is. Sandrine - his last young lady - she was much less... Mother. just because we're... Did I say anything bad? Sandrine was charming. ''Charming''! Yeah. sure. The girl had no ambition. I always told your son that. She was a dead weight. There's a time for everything. Antonin wasn't ready then. that's all. L?once mentioned your bonus. He's pleased with you. You've exceeded your goals. Well done. - Thanks. - Remember my ten percent. And how are things with Consini? He's putting pressure on Nora to unsettle me. It's ridiculous - like he wants her to replace me. He's got a point. She'II soon be capable. Don't waste your time with him. He's an obstacle. Eliminate him. Quickly. Careers are getting more precarious. You might spend five years in an office. tops. Five years to get as high up as possible. is that it? Or get trampled underfoot. Life is movement. Either upwards... or down. He's gone. He's lost his mind! There's a man in your office. threatening to smash everything up! - What? - Call security! Wait. Iet me look. I know him. I'II see what he wants. Let me deal with it. - Call security. - Yep. Now I understand! Now. I see. I'm on my own! That's how they do it. Just me! What are you talking about. Beno?t? Of course. you don't believe me. That's normal. I'm on my own! I'm totally fucked. They won't leave me alone. They're killers. Someone wants your job. you're dead! Tell me what's going on. You're with them! I'm not with anybody! You want my head. too! - You're with Pirelli! - It's just the two of us. Why would they want to kill you? Someone wants my job! That's enough to get rid of me! They're going to do me in! Calm down. You're safe in here. Get out. will you? Let us do... Get the fuck out! Let us do our job! The victim was your competitor for a major commission that you had just won. What sector was it in? International deliveries. I don't see what difference it makes The man was clearly disturbed. God is in the detail. Mr Magellan. Mr Brecht. can you confirm this? You had no other relationship with the victim? We saw each other around. So the relationship was purely competitive? Exactly. Anything else I should know? He had two children. I think. Yes. two little girls. Alice and Marie. six and ten. Thank you. gentlemen. Sorry to bother you. Martin-Girard. Beno?t. both hired by Pirelli. as if by chance. He pushes them over the edge. It suits him. he depends on our performance. If you stagnate. he gets rid of you. But Beno?t was stubborn. like Martin-Girard. Pirelli told me that himself. He might push them to resign. Resigning wouldn't put him in that state. Look. no-one wants to lose their job. So we invest a lot in it - maybe too much. Who knows how we'd react when it suddenly stops. I don't know... I don't know what's normal anymore. What he did to you was disgusting. You try to help him. to understand him. and he kills himself. So naturally. you have negative stress. But it will pass. You should take some time off. We could go to Cabourg. You get some rest. I'II take care of work. and I'II meet you this weekend. What do you think? Sound good? I have ''negative stress''? How long have you known Pirelli? You're scaring me. You want to muscle in on Magellan? You want my job. don't you? He's completely lost. He thinks Fastelle killed himself because of you. He's talking about accidents. death... And you? What do you think? He's overdoing it. I know you'd never... I'd never murder my own clients? You're quite right. That might be counter-productive. I don't know how to act around him. You must realise your methods are a little unsettling. You had no problem with my methods. when I secured you the job in his office. with the promise of a speedy promotion. Or when I took his girlfriend out of the picture. Have you fallen in love? We say ''fall'' in love. There's an idea of failure. ''Love - ''a poodle's chance of attaining the infinite''. as C?line said. Keep going. Nora. Antonin's in a state of shock. I'II talk to him. - Don't hurt him. - Why would I? I only want the best for him. as you know. Eye-to-screen distance? 60 centimetres. Screen curvature? - Five degrees. - It's close. but it'II do. Refresh rate? 60 megahertz. That's the problem. Tell them to raise it to 70. and change the resolution from 800 to 600. I'II draw a diagram. Someone wants my job. They're going to do me in! Calm down. you're safe in here. Get out. will you? Get out of here! Get the fuck out! Let us do our job! Where are you going? I need some peace. I'II mail you the diagram. What's wrong? Talk to me. please. You can get me on the mobile. Sudden resignation. Philippe Mauberger. went missing. Laure Mercoeur. depression. - What's with the flowers? - They're pansies. For you. Thanks. Will you help? Yep. I'm really... Yes. Hello. Hi. Mum. No. go ahead. What? Just a second. when did Pirelli contact you? No. I'm delighted! So just as Dad was settling into retirement. he's found a new job? At 67? What am I supposed to say? Okay. bye. Sugar? - Isn't that on the file? - One. Can I ask - what you're doing here? - Nora let me in. Don't be mad at her. she's concerned about you. As are we all. I'm absolutely fine. You take such an interest in my life Thanks for my Dad. You can't find Iasting professional success without a balanced family life. Look at Fastelle. his wife wanted a third child. but he wasn't ''available'' for it. I don't have time for this. I have a committee meeting. Nora's told them. She'II take your place. Aren't you showering? So. what's going to happen to me? You're going through a difficult time. Antonin. My recruitment operates by natural selection. which some people don't like. But you're not - one of them. - The ones you eliminate? - They mostly eliminate themselves. - Like Fastelle. AIthough for different reasons. Do you know Adam Smith's theory of The Invisible Hand? It combines people's personal selfishness into the general good. It's the basis of economic liberalism. You might say that I'm this invisible hand. tweaking the cogs so they run smoothly. And if the cog sticks. you remove it. I'm pleased you've understood the system so quickly. Proof that I was right about you. I want you to free up Consini's position for me. I'm listening. Clearly. since his friend Martin-Girard died. he's lost his grip. He's looking backwards. and aggressive - it's counter-productive. And you think he's become incapable? It's obvious. But he'II never admit it. so we must decide for him. You know what this means. Once you've confirmed your plan. there's no backing out. Careers are too short to get hung up on scruples. as you've always said. How will you take him out of action? I'II look at his file. And if necessary. I'II hire some qualified personnel. Aren't you worried that your qualified personneI might turn on you. one day? It's they who should worry. And you should know. above a certain profit margin. I have no trouble respecting my clients' confidentiality. Does anyone else know your methods? Not many people discuss it so frankly as you. Most of my prot?g?s Iike to believe they're there because they deserve it. They're nave. or cynical. Consini. wait. Brecht? - Your car's been rigged. - What? I told Pirelli I wanted your job. to trick him. - Who's this? - We work together. A man killed himself in his office... No. he was driven to it. Hard to believe. but that's how they work. Let's talk tomorrow. You're next. for God's sake! Like Martin-Girard. My keys! Hello... So. to sum up - you're claiming these people were assassinated. I don't ''claim'' it. they were all killed. And Beno?t Fastelle. Oh yeah. the suicide at Magellan. Call Sergeant Boumedjane. he'II confirm it. And now. Pirelli's going to murder your Director General. so you can have his job. You attacked him to protect him. Am I right? Look. Consini's life is at risk. Now do something! The problem is. we checked his car. It was in perfect working order. What an idiot! Okay. Pirelli knew I wasn't on his side. He tricked me. to discredit me. He knew I was onto him. he knows us all inside out. That's how he trips us up - - the invisible hand! - The ''invisible hand''. Yep. Good one! Don't mind them. You think I'm funny? Soon. they'II be here too. and it'II happen to you! Hey! Calm down. You're free to go. But you must remain available for a court hearing. when Consini makes a complaint. You'II soon receive a summons. Please. just call Boumedjane. You should get yourself looked at. Next time. we'II be less tolerant. 1 3th district police. please. Sergeant Boumedjane. I was so worried. I thought that he'd... I called everywhere. Look at me. Look at me. You have to trust me. Otherwise you'II end up like the rest. That's how he wins. he isolates his victims. It's only together we'II get out of this. Okay. Together. Good night. ''Together''! How much is Pirelli paying you to spy on me? Do you work on commission or a fixed rate? Go on. tell me. I was working for Pirelli. but I couldn't take anymore. Did he send you? You were both stringing me along. I had no idea how far he was prepared to go. He lied to me. manipulated me. He does it to everyone he recruits. You. your family. Sandrine... Don't mention her. He arranged it so she'd walk in on us. Stop lying. or I swear... Antonin. I came here because I love you. I can't help that. either. The whore with a heart. who fell in love and betrayed her employer! Give me a break. Did you think you'd sedate me. Iead me out of here and kill me outside? I trusted you. Nora. - My love. - How could I... My love. He's untouchable. He's above the law. he has contacts everywhere. Come on. Let's go. Now. - Nora! There you are. - No. I came as quickly as I could. No. It wasn't me. Believe me. - listen to your heart. - What heart? Antonin! Antonin! Calm down. Go and wait in his office. Now. Let him leave. You can do it outside. Mr Brecht? Give us the documents! Mr Brecht! Let's go. Mummy. can I have a coin for the man. please? Mrs Martin-Girard. Do you remember me? Pirelli tried to kill me. too. I need you to testify. I don't know you. Please. I can't do it without you. They'II listen to you. Listen. Sir - I was shattered by my husband's death. I must have invented motives which didn't really exist. It was an accident. That's all. - Have they threatened you? - No. Did they bribe you? Your husband was murdered! I'm on my own. Please. go away. I'm on my own. - Hello? - Is Geoffroy home? He won't be long. Who's calling? - Sandrine. is that you? - Antonin? Nobody believes me. I believe you. Get some rest. then we'II go to the police together. Sorry. I... I just roll up here. without asking how you are. I resigned. I'd had enough. And Geoffroy's letting me stay while I find my feet. You know... things haven't been easy for me either. Antonin's here. sleeping. He's in a terrible state. No kidding. Read this. Apparently he couldn't take the pressure of his new job. He'd already beaten up his girlfriend. a few days before. BRECHT KILLS HIS MISTRESS AND COMMITS SUICID. SHE DIDN'T SURVIVE. Nora? Antonin. I didn't believe her. She died because of me. I lost myself. and everyone I loved. Stop it. - Where are you going? - To create a vacancy. Don't be stupid. Antonin! Sir. Sir. Sir! Mr Brecht? It's Sergeant Boumedjane. I'm coming in. Stay the fuck out! - Put down the gun. Mr Brecht. - Get out. or he'II never come. I'm sorry about Nora Merteuil. I know you weren't involved. I should have acted sooner. it's my fault. I don't give a shit. I'm going to kill him. After your alleged suicide. I made the link. I checked the list that you left with my colleagues. It's all true. He'II never go to prison. We need to get rid of him. - It's up to me to do it. - No. Andr? Consini withdrew his complaint Thanks to you. he's agreed to testify against Pirelli. So you're not going to spoil everything. and prove him right. You're being foolhardy. but it takes a lot of courage - to come after him. - What courage? Just get lost. I said get lost. he's on his way! No... He's not coming back. He's left the country. I won't lie. we have nothing on him. Offshore headquarters. a bank in Luxemburg... the same old tricks. That's why we need you. He has a wife. and a child - Gabriel. No. He invented them. To reassure you. To make you trust him. But you can help us find his henchmen. The ones you saw. Who tried to kill you. We can trace it back to him. I promise you. Don't let him win this! Come on! Come on! Good. Boumedjane tracked down the man who'd pretended to sabotage Consini's car. Naturally. he'd never heard of Pirelli. Anonymous rendez-vous. 1 O.OOO euros in cash. Above a certain profit margin. you can be sure of someone's confidentiality. Nora. I realised too late. We make our own problems. Above a certain level of ambition. certain things are sure to pass you by. Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! I'm coming! So. did you miss Daddy? You did an excellent job. It's proved that I was right about you. I've set up my business in a developing country. and I know that very soon. there'II be a vacancy for you.
