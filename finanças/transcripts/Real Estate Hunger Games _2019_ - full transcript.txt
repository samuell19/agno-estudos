Chrishell and Christine on this chair. Let's go red, black, red, black on the couch. - So, Heather... - Okay. Jason likes to do those photos for the company, so they're gonna feature in magazines, flyers, website, maybe even a poster in his bedroom. Who knows? Actually, why don't... Yes, stand. Your shoes will be in the picture, but kind of sitting right there. - So we sit? - Yeah, this is actually pretty good. Our marketing shots are gonna be epic. - [Jason] Or Maya and Heather, to switch. - Yeah, exactly. Maybe, just, when you're holding the jacket, don't have your elbow up here. - Have it come down. - Okay. And then it goes brunette, blonde, brunette, too. Why don't you two switch? - You have the Zoolander look right now. - [Mary laughs] I'm practicing. Some girls definitely take it more seriously than others. I'm not gonna say names. But... Christine. [chuckles] Let's do some gangster ones and some smiles. Yup. Let's do gangster first. You guys ready for gangster? [Davina] All right, guys, look alive. Do I look like a fat girl in a club dress, like, sitting like this? - What?! - Like on a Saturday night? [Michael] Good. One, two, three. Power pose. No smiling. [Jason] No smiling. Nice, loving it. Good. Here we go. - You guys all on the same page? - Seriously, I'm sitting on an inch. Seriously, my whole ass is numb. [Brett] Just rub it out for a second. [Mary laughs] Good job, guys. Nice meeting everyone. [Brett] Good, looking good. Nice. Good job, good job. [Maya] Do we have it or... If you guys are looking at the monitor, do you only look at yourselves - or are you looking at everyone else, too? - Myself. [Jason] So many are good. We're gonna drive each other nuts if we look at this. There's no... - We already drive each other nuts. - But even more. This is good. ♪ This is the time of our lives ♪ ♪ Here and now ♪ ♪ Are we young and the silent? ♪ ♪ Got it all figured out ♪ ♪ This is the time of our lives ♪ [Chrishell] Mary, what did you get? Latte. I like that you just said a law-tte. - [laughs] - If it's like a law-tte. [Chrishell] Okay, Mary, I'm gonna take you back home with me, girl. If you got a law-tte. Shoot, doggone, that's a law-tte. Oh, my God. I think all of us used to have an accent at some point, didn't we? - Oh, I did for sure. - Yeah. [Chrishell] I still have it if I have a few drinks. [Christine] Yeah, no, I do, too. Mine comes out, too. So I had a date with Jacob over the weekend. - Oh, you did? - Oh, how did it go? The chemistry physically wasn't there, and it's just going to be on a professional level. - We're just going to be friends. - Uh. - Well, at least you know. - Yeah. Yeah. - On to the next? - On to the next. Right. - [Chrishell] Hey, boys. - [Christine] Hey, guys. Hey, hun. I actually need to speak with both of you briefly. [Christine] Okay. Are we in trouble? Okay. - Actually, good news. - [Chrishell] Yeah? I received a call from one of the founders of Wag, - you know, the dog-walking app. - [Christine] Okay. And you had met with her recently at an open house. - Her name's Alexandra. - [Chrishell] Yeah. Yes, yes. And you had actually represented a colleague of hers in the past. I think it was maybe a couple years ago. So she actually wants to meet or speak with both of you. Okay. Like, a co-listing? [Brett] I don't know how it's going to work out. To be honest, it's up to you guys. This is her contact. So she wants to meet with us together or separate? [Brett] I don't even know. I know she wants to meet with both of you. My priority is that she gets the representation she wants. Whatever works for her works for us. All right. Real estate Hunger Games. All right. Someone who knows the Strip would be the best for this client, considering, you know, Sunset Strip is my area of expertise. Maybe she wants a charity case. Maybe she wants to help a stray dog.

So, it's important that it sells and it sells quick. I feel like they're already losing a little trust in me. [Heather] Welcome. Hi. - [Heather] Who's this? - This is Kangaroo. Kangaroo, how cute. Hi, baby. [man] This is a cute little guest room. [woman] Yeah. [Heather] Um, the home was built in 1938. - It was just newly renovated. - [woman] Nice. [Heather] Yeah, they put in a little over two million. Wow, look at this view! - [man] Peter would love this. - Hey, guys. I just wanted to make sure everything was going okay. - Yeah. - Do you like it? - Yeah. - Awesome. - I'm looking to expand. - Okay. Uh, my wardrobe is getting too big and my boyfriend's getting fatter, - so we need more room. - Oh, he is? [laughs] So, uh, he needs a trainer and you need a bigger closet. Got that. We have a special spot for Kangaroo right here. - [woman] Aw, so sweet. Kangy, look! - [Heather] Yeah. Yes. I want to give you a brochure. Um, are there any schools in the area? 'Cause I'm thinking of having a baby soon. - You are? Exciting! - Yeah. Yeah, there are great schools in the area. I love that you're gonna have a baby soon. I know! I'm not pregnant yet. Yeah, but, you know, you're thinking about it. - Amazing, thank you so much. - You're welcome. Bye, Kangaroo. So cute. [Christine] Holly Drive is so cute. [Jason] And so well priced. I don't know what's going on. She's looking, ideally, south of Wilshire, but... South of Wilshire, ideally? Oh. [Jason] Mary, totally off-topic, I'm looking at buying a Picasso ceramic vase. Do you mind taking a look at it? I'm going to put it in my kitchen. [Mary] Hey, Christine, do you want to buy a Picasso vase for 35 grand, too? That's it? That's a steal. Sign me up. - Can you come look at it before I get it? - We should all get one. It's 12 inches by six and a half inches. - It's cool, though. I really like it. - I have the perfect spot for it. Oh, originally 40 grand, now only... - It's a steal, man. - Yeah. I mean, where did you find that? [Jason] Uh, Belgium. - I love their waffles and the... - [Mary laughs] Yeah, I'm pretty excited. [Jason] Why don't we get the team meeting started right now? [Davina] Okay. Come here, sweetheart. Come see Papa. Come see Papa! - Okay. - [Jason] Okay. Uh, Christine, what's up with you? Um, I had a really interesting showing the other day. For the first time, I had someone walk out without completing the tour. I showed it to them and they loved it. They thought it was beautiful... And then you turn around, you're like, "Wait, where are you guys?" I was like, " Great! Let's go to the other side of the house now." And they're like, "We're good, thanks." If it makes you feel better, I've had, often times with celebrities, I've had them pull up, take off, and their manager calls me five minutes later and says, "You know what? They don't need to see it. They don't like the outside." [Maya] Yeah, it's so rude. Like, it's so disrespectful for the time. Unfortunately, honestly, in this business, people waste your time all the time. Um... Mary, what's going on? - I just closed, uh, two escrows... - [Heather] Whoo! Yay. ...and then another one this month as well. So, yeah, that's three. Oh, speaking of which, I'm gonna be bringing you on a listing that I've got, about three point six million, because you have closed so many deals lately. Oh, that's awesome. Thank you. - You got it. You deserved it. - Very cool. I appreciate that. - Good job. - I do not think there's any favoritism. He rewards who kicks ass and sells homes. [Maya] There are three favorites in the office. Mary, Mary, and also Mary. Then you have Nico and Zelda. So yeah. So we are probably behind Mary, Nico, and Zelda. All right, so I know you all are working very hard, but we do need to start closing some more deals. Okay? Speaking of closing deals, Heather, I took this agent Kelsey and her client over to your Sunset Plaza listing, they loved it. - Awesome. It's ready to go. - That house is looking good. It would mean everything to me if he found a buyer for this house and helped me close this deal. - Let's get back to work, everyone. - [all] All right. Come on, sweetheart, jump. [Heather] Oh. Ooh. ♪ Well, I'm doing ♪ ♪ I know I'm not losing ♪ ♪ There ain't no confusion... ♪ Do I look like a crack whore today? 'Cause I feel one. Sometimes I'm like, "Yeah, I'm such a supermodel today." And I'm like "Who's that Lindsay Lohan drug addict in my mirror? I'm like... I hate when that happens. [Chrishell] Um, I'm a little nervous. I've never... I've had this with like, you know, when someone's listing their house where they want to meet several different agents, - but I've never had it with a buyer. - [Christine] And not at the same time. I know, it's very strange. So I don't really know what to expect. It's like we've been given a mission. Thanks, Charlie. I love a good mission. Hi! So a lot of times in Los Angeles, you're talking to people's people. I heard that Alexandra is representing the owners of Wag, and, um, she's delegated to look at houses for them, so hopefully we can find them the right house. - How are you today? - Good, how are you? - Great. - So, this is weird, but do people ever tell you that you look like LC from Laguna Beach? - Yes. - Totally. Yes. So we're excited to see you today. I know obviously I met you before. And I was curious how you heard about me, because I think we have a mutual friend? We do. So one of my colleagues, Eva, she had mentioned you. - Oh, my gosh, I love Eva. Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah, so I definitely was like, have to meet and learn more about you and kind of see what you see as my vision. Please tell her I said hello. I will, definitely. So I remember you mentioned a little bit, but I was telling Christine, I couldn't remember exactly. What is it that you do? So I'm one of the founding team members of Wag, the dog walking app. - That's it. Yeah. - [Christine] I love that company. So, I used to have a doberman, - so I would hire you guys. Yeah. - That's great. I'm glad to hear of a user. [Christine] Yeah, yeah. So, no, I know all about you guys. So, really I wanted to meet with both of you to kind of give you an idea of what he's looking for. Do you have any idea of what neighborhood, square footage, price point? So, preferably, uh, Hollywood. A big factor for him would be finding a place - that's in walking distance of work. - Convenience. Dog friendly, uh, place. You want a yard? Okay. Got it. Other than walking distance, the price point we decided is between four point two to four point six. Okay. Um, seeing a range of places in that price point would be great. And then, three to four bedrooms, three to four bathrooms. - Three to four. - Okay. We do plan on just going with one person. I feel that gives me more of that opportunity to bond and get that vision and have the experience we would like. So, as far as working styles, how would you both say you work with your clients? - Do you want to go first? - Um, well, basically, I'm very hands on, so what I'll do is I'll get a feel for what you're looking for. I'll map it out. I'll write it down. I'll do my research on making sure that I can find you not only what you're looking for, but something that's maybe not necessarily out there on the MLS available to people. And I'll do my best to negotiate, get you a great deal, stay within your price point, and, um, make sure that you're happy. - Awesome. - You know? Yeah. So just to add onto what she said, because it was basically a perfect answer, for me personally, I would just say... I'm from the South, so I'm very, like, one-on-one. And I would just say, I just bought a house last year and it was very stressful, so I would think my job is to let you enjoy the process and let me take the stress on, 'cause I think that's important. I would just try and make sure every step of the way that it would be an enjoyable process. So you, um, haven't been working with the Oppenheim Group as long, correct? I haven't. I've actually been there probably about, I'd say, four months now. Okay. And how long have you been with Oppenheim? I've been at the company for, like, almost four years. - I've known Jason for a little while. - [Alexandra] Oh, wow. Yeah. Both of you are awesome, and we really do look forward to working with one of you, so over the next day or two I definitely will make that decision and then we can go to the next step. Christine and I have the same resources. We are both probably going to be able to deliver the same quality of listings for her to look at. I just need to make sure that she wants to spend more time with me. - [Alexandra] It will be great. - We'll be in touch for sure. - Awesome, thanks. Bye. - Take care, we'll be in touch. Bye! Okay, so... [sighs] That wasn't what I thought it was gonna be. I know. I'm gonna stress eat. [chuckles] [Christine] No, I know. I know. That stresses me out. It's gonna really hurt your feelings when I get this. How are you gonna deal with this, Chrishell? [whimpering] I know, baby. I know, Papa's here. Um, what's everybody doing tomorrow? [Maya] We're doing the Broker's Open, and then I'm catching actually the red eye because I'm having my first ultrasound the next day. - [Mary] Yay! - [Heather] Oh, that's so cool. - I wanted my husband to be with me, and... - [Christine] Of course. Yeah. [Davina] That's so exciting. Are you sure it's his baby? Um... Last time I checked, it was, yeah. [chuckles] [laughs] Um, you're gonna be back when? - [Maya] So I'm flying Tuesday night. - [Heather] We need you back. - I'll be back Friday. - Okay. 'Cause I have, like, uh, showings on Saturday and Sunday. [Davina] Here? Yeah. Yeah, just showings, showings. I mean, I need closing. That's what I need. [Heather] We all need that, right? Yeah. So, you guys, I have my friend-slash-client coming in. His name's Brandon. I showed him the 40-million-dollar house. - Awesome. Amazing. - Oh, wow. How did it go? [Heather] Really, really well. Are you sure you don't want to get in? I'm deciding not to swim today. I think it's absolutely amazing. He has someone that he thinks would be interested. Like, a Chinese investor. - Is he a playboy model, too? - [chuckles] He should be, but maybe you can, um, check him out... I'll be the judge of that. Oh, my God. If that guys buys it, you have to get your friend the best gift ever. I know. Well, I told him I'd give him a referral if he obviously... He's not buying it, guys. My client's buying it. [Maya] Christine, you have to show some support. - No, I'm happy for you. - [Maya] Yeah, right. In the meantime, let me work on my $500,000 condo buyer. - That would be awesome. - Hey, everything counts. - Everything counts. Including leases. - Seriously, money is money. [Maya] I agree. - Hello. Hi. - [Heather] Hi! - Oh, here he is. - [Brandon] Hello. - Hi, welcome to my second home. - [Brandon] Hey, how are you? - Great place. - Thank you. - It's not mine, but thank you. - You look fantastic, as always. - How's everything? - Good. - Did you talk to him? - A little bit. I gave some hints. So I just need a little bit more information. [Christine] There's no competition between Heather and I. I was the first person to show the property and I'm gonna be the last. [Heather] Jason. - Hey, how are you? - [Brandon] Good, how are you? - Brandon. - Brandon Larkin. Very nice to meet you. - You as well. Heather's told me about you. - How's it going? I'm Brett. - Nice to meet you. - Pleasure. This is quite a crew you guys have here. Yeah, this is our office. This is the team. Wanna meet the team? Mary, Christine, Davina, Maya, and Chrishell. Hi! - Pleasure to meet you. - And the dogs. Let me get you a water. And then we can sit down there... - Sure. - ...and discuss everything. Excuse me. Thank you. [Heather] Excuse me, baby. [Heather] Are those frosted tips? Like, people are still doing that? I feel like he could have been a Backstreet Boy in his previous life. Like, he wanted to be a little bit. It's like, Heather's new boyfriend or something? [Christine] I mean, they look really cute together. So tell me, you... Tell me what the situation is. I know you saw Hillside and you have somebody who's interested? Exactly. He's been looking for something. It needs to be very LA. You know, he wants a Hollywood lifestyle. He wants something that nobody else has. [Brett] And you saw the TV that comes up? This house has tons of things that no other house has. I think they're just friends, though. [Brandon] Heather, correct me if I'm wrong on this, but this is the last one that has the zoning ability to be able to build it with this square footage? - Of that size, yes. - [Brett] You won't see anything that size. There's a Hillside ordinance that took effect last year, drastically reducing the size of properties you can build based on the land, so in order to build a house that big now, you'd have to have acreage. And there's no such thing as acreage in the Hills. You won't see that again. There's nothing that compares to this house. When dealing with billionaires, they want what nobody else can have. They don't want just another house based on money. The money has to make sense, but want something to be really unique. This moat... It's the longest pool in the Hollywood Hills. See, now I have to tell you, that's what my client would love. And I know it's tough to walk through a house without it being finished, but the good side is, you're the only person seeing it. A handful of people are seeing it. We have the exclusive on the house right now. The more that we can do visually, the better we're gonna be, and with numbers, because there's a language barrier. Let's put a really good packet together of the renderings, a list of all the amenities. Uh, perhaps we have some photos of the furniture - and the artwork. - Okay. And just try to paint the picture. At least enough to get him out here. Gentlemen, this sounds great. - It was a pleasure. Cheers. - It was a pleasure, man. - Very good to meet you. - Yeah, you as well. - Heather, always a pleasure to see you. - [Jason] Take care. - Ladies, it was a pleasure. Take care. - [Jason] Stop by anytime, my man. - Thank you so much, guys. - Yeah, good job. [Heather] Are you guys gonna be happy for me or jealous? A little bit of both. Okay, all y'all relax. She hasn't sold it yet, okay? Come on. You guys are getting so hyped. Jesus. [Heather] I love these girls, but they're definitely catty. I have a chance to make a ton of money and I'm sure they want a piece of the pie as well. [Chrishell] You know, wanted to get together with the pooches and just basically tell you, you know, in a casual setting, I do think that with a new, first-time buyer, I just did this myself, so I feel like I can be better equipped to kind of, like, help you through the process. ♪ If we only get this one life ♪ ♪ Don't you wanna feel good all day All night? ♪ ♪ Bet you we could have a good time ♪ Hi! - How are you, babe? - Good, how are you? - Good to see you. - You too.

I love that he's pulling down his shorts, like, "What are you gonna see if I pull it down a little further?" What? I need to see what's going on underneath the shirt. I want to live your life.

So, any second she's gonna show up. I think they're trying to get the house off the market before your broker open. - Really? - That's what it sounded like. - So he loved it. - Yeah. If this offer comes in, this house will be sold within 48 hours of hitting the market which is incredible. That's pretty rare. I'd say that happens maybe ten percent of the time. - Hey, Kelsey. - Hey, guys. You have good news for us? I do. Thanks for meeting me before the broker starts. - Nice to see you. - Hi, how are you? - Good. - What's going on? Um, so my client is interested in the home. He wants to submit an offer of five point three. Five point three. Okay. If we can get it today before the broker's open starts. - You wanna take it off market right now? - [Kelsey] We do. Yeah, I need to call them and see if that number would work. - Go ahead, take a minute. - Okay, give me a minute. Good. That works. So he really liked it? He does. It's perfect for them. Hi. So I have some news. I showed the home to a prospective buyer. And I just met with the agent and they want to submit an offer. In order to take it off the market today, what number do you want? All right, Kelsey. So I just spoke to my client, five point three is a little bit low. Okay. They are willing to settle today, take it off the market, but the number, the final number is $5,425,000. - Okay. - And that's it. So we can't go any lower than that. All right. Well, I have him on standby, so I'll just shoot him a text really fast and I'll let you guys know. - Okay. - All right. - It's exciting, though. - Mm-hmm. [Heather] I mean, but here's the thing, everyone loved this home, so if they can't come to the number we want, forget it. I'm totally cool with that. Are you guys... You're positive that's it, right? Yeah. There's no wiggle room. No. Absolutely not. Yeah. We should definitely play hardball right now. I mean, there's nothing we can do. That's the number they want. I'm not gonna go against it. [Kelsey] All right. - [Heather] What? - You got yourself a deal. - Seriously? - Yep. - Today. Yes. - Really? Shake on it. Okay. - Congratulations. - You guys got to take it off today. - No broker's open. - No. - All right. - Congratulations. - Thank you, nice doing business with you. - Thank you. - I'll send over the paperwork. Okay. Bye. - [Heather] Thanks, Kelsey. Wait, am I imagining? Did it really happen? No, that happened. This gives me confidence, because it's been so long for me... That's a six-figure commission. - Yay! - That's big. Can we celebrate, please? I've had so much stress, I need to... Yeah. Well, first I'm gonna jump in that pool. Okay. Can I push you? Please? Please? Let me get my jacket off. [Christine] Any good homes, Maya? Uh, there are a lot of nice ones, you know?
