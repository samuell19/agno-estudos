( gunshots ) THIS IS WHERE I TOLD DEPUTY JACKSON TO MEET US. HEY, LOOK. THERE'S A STRAY HORSE OVER THERE WITH A SADDLE ON. LET'S HAVE A LOOK. FUZZY, TAKE A LOOK DOWN THERE. IS THAT HIM? IT'S JACKSON, ALL RIGHT. HE MUST HAVE KNOWN HE WAS MEETING US WITH THE INFORMATION. THAT MAKES THE THIRD DEPUTY IN A MONTH. WELL, WE GOTTA GET HIM OUT OF HERE. EVERYTHING COME OFF ALL RIGHT, JUDD? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? YOU KNOW, THAT DEPUTY--JACKSON. YOU'RE NOT HERE TO ASK QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT. HEY, JUDD. GRAYSON'S GOT YOUNG WALTERS IN A GAME OVER THERE. WELL, THAT WASHES ME UP. WOULD YOU MIND IF I SIT IN? PLEASED TO HAVE YOU-- HOW ABOUT YOU, WALTERS? SURE. THANK YOU. HEY, BEN, DRINKS FOR THE GENTLEMEN. COMIN' RIGHT UP. SHERIFF, DID YOU SEE MY BROTHER AL? I WOULDN'T SWEAR TO IT, MISS WALTERS, BUT I THINK HE'S OVER IN THE SALOON. I BEGGED HIM NOT TO GO IN THERE. I'LL HOLD. WHAT ABOUT YOU, WALTERS? FORTY BUCKS. IT'LL COST YOU TWENTY MORE. THAT BEATS ME. I'M RIDIN' RIGHT ALONG WITH YOU. WHAT HAVE YOU GOT? FULL HOUSE. JUST A MINUTE. FOUR DEUCES. YOU COULDN'T HAVE FOUR DEUCES. WHY NOT? I DISCARDED ONE. ARE YOU SUGGESTING-- YOU STAY OUT OF THIS! IT'S CROOKED AND MAYBE YOU'RE A CROOK, TOO. KEEP TALKING LIKE THAT AND YOU'LL BE SORRY. YOU'RE BOTH CROOKS-- I'M GONNA CALL THE LAW ON YOU. YOU ASKED FOR THIS. AL! HE'S DEAD. YOU MURDERER. IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE, ASK ANYBODY. IT WAS COLD-BLOODED MURDER, JUST LIKE ALL THE OTHER KILLINGS AROUND HERE, AND I'M GOING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. JUST WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA DO ABOUT IT? I'M GOING TO WRITE A LETTER TO THE UNITED STATES MARSHAL. I'LL TELL HIM WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS TOWN, AND I'LL NAME NAMES. I WOULDN'T IF I WERE YOU, AND I'D GET OUT OF TOWN WHILE YOU'RE STILL HEALTHY. IT'LL TAKE MORE THAN YOUR THREATS TO MAKE ME LEAVE TOWN, BILL JUDD. YEAH? WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT. I DON'T MIND A MAN-AGAINST-MAN FIGHT, BUT A MAN-AGAINST-WOMAN FIGHT CALLS FOR SOME INTERFERENCE. THIS'LL TEACH YA TO MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS! NOW REACH! LET'S KEEP THIS A CLEAN FIGHT. NOW, MISS, TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. THAT MAN JUST KILLED MY BROTHER. WHAT'S THE TROUBLE HERE? ARREST THAT MAN, SHERIFF. FOR WHAT? FOR MURDER. HE KILLED AL. THE MAN WAS GOIN' FOR ME, I SHOT IN SELF-DEFENSE. IF IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE, I'M NOT GONNA ARREST HIM. A MAN'S GOT A RIGHT TO DEFEND HIMSELF. WHAT KIND OF A LAWMAN ARE YOU? HE SHOULD BE ARRESTED AND HELD FOR TRIAL. I DON'T MAKE ARRESTS ON THE SAY-SO OF ANY STRANGER THAT RIDES INTO TOWN. THEN WE'LL ROUND UP SOME WITNESSES. WHICH OF YOU SAW HIM SHOOT DOWN THAT YOUNG MAN? ALL DEAF, DUMB, BLIND. WELL, THE BOYS GAVE YOU THEIR ANSWER. NOW GET. I THINK I'LL STICK AROUND-- THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG HERE. COME ON, FUZZY, LET'S HELP THE LADY WITH HER BROTHER. I JUST KILLED AL WALTERS. GOOD, ANOTHER ONE OUT OF THE WAY. BUT THERE'S STILL TROUBLE. WHAT KIND? HIS SISTER--SAID SHE WAS WRITING TO THE MARSHAL. GET HER OUT OF THIS TERRITORY. ALL RIGHT, BOSS. BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE. WHAT IS IT? A STRANGER IN TOWN, ASKING A LOT OF QUESTIONS. WHO IS HE? NOBODY KNOWS--HE WANTED THE SHERIFF TO ARREST ME. GET RID OF HIM, TOO. BUT HOW? YOU KNOW HOW. YEAH, I KNOW-- AND HE'S GOT IT COMING TO HIM. HE WAS A WONDERFUL BROTHER. A LITTLE WILD, BUT GOOD. HE NEVER HURT ANYBODY. WHY DID THIS HAVE TO HAPPEN TO US NOW, JUST WHEN EVERYTHING WAS BEGINNING TO WORK OUT. WHY, UNCLE BOB? I DON'T KNOW, BETTY. WE JUST GOTTA MAKE THE BEST OF THINGS WITHOUT HIM. COME ON, MISS BETTY. OUR JOB IS TO SEE THAT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN TO ANY MORE FOLKS AROUND HERE. THIS IS MIGHTY RICH COUNTRY. HOW COME THERE AREN'T MORE SETTLERS AROUND? THERE WERE, LOTS OF THEM, TILL BILL JUDD AND HIS GANG SHOWED UP. THIS GAMBLER, GRAYSON-- HOW LONG HAS HE BEEN IN TOWN? OH, ABOUT TWO MONTHS. WHAT NOBODY CAN FIGURE OUT IS WHAT A SLICK GAMBLER WANTS IN A SMALL PLACE LIKE THIS. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO NOW THAT YOU'RE ALL ALONE? SHE WON'T BE ALONE-- I'M STAYIN' ON. THANKS, UNCLE BOB. WITH YOU AROUND, I CAN STICK IT OUT. I LIKE YOUR SPIRIT, YOUNG LADY. I'LL GO PUT UP THE HORSES. ALL RIGHT, I'LL GET SUPPER TOGETHER. I BET YOUR UNCLE'S A BIG HELP TO YOU. HE'S NOT REALLY MY UNCLE. HE'S JUST AN OLD FRIEND OF THE FAMILY'S. HE WAS WIPED OUT IN THE DROUGHT ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO AND CAME TO WORK FOR US. HE'S A LITTLE TOUCHED ON SOME SUBJECTS, BUT HE'S ALWAYS BEEN VERY LOYAL. YOU'LL BE SHORTHANDED WITHOUT YOUR BROTHER, WON'T YOU? YES, I WILL. WOULD IT HELP ANY IF WE STAYED ON? THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL-- WOULD YOU? WOULD YOU LIKE TO STAY PUT FOR A FEW WEEKS, FUZZY? FINE--WE CAN BOTH USE A LITTLE REST. YEP, IT WAS ME THAT SETTLED THIS TERRITORY-- FIRST MAN IN THE VALLEY. TOO BAD YOU LOST YOUR HOMESTEAD, UNCLE BOB, WHY DIDN'T YOU START UP AGAIN? A LOT OF RIFF-RAFF MOVED IN, TOOK UP EVERYTHING. SURE WAS A FINE MEAL, MISS BETTY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I DON'T WANT ANY MORE COFFEE. COME ON, HAVE ANOTHER CUP. IT KEEPS ME AWAKE. YOU DON'T WANT TO HURT BETTY'S FEELINGS, DO YOU? ( grumbling: ) ALL RIGHT. SOON AS YOU'RE FINISHED, I'LL SHOW YOU BOYS WHERE TO BUNK. IT'LL SURE BE FINE TO STRETCH OUT IN A NICE, COMFORTABLE BUNK AGAIN. AH, IF IT AIN'T ONE THING, IT'S ANOTHER. I'M GONNA GET ME A NEW PARTNER, THAT'S ALL. OKAY, SO LONG. YOU TRYIN' TO GET RID OF ME? WELL, YOU'RE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE LIFE YOU LEAD. I DON'T SEE WHY WE STAY OUT HERE ALL NIGHT WHEN WE COULD HAVE SLEPT IN A NICE, COMFORTABLE BUNK. 'CAUSE I GOT A HUNCH SOMETHING'S GONNA HAPPEN. YOU MEAN WE'RE GONNA SIT HERE ALL DAY? IF IT'S NECESSARY. I CAN'T DO IT, I'LL FALL ASLEEP. NOT AFTER ALL THE COFFEE YOU DRANK LAST NIGHT. NO, THAT WORE OFF HOURS AGO. THERE'S THE RANCH. WE'LL LEAVE OUR HORSES HERE AND SNEAK UP ON FOOT. JOE, YOU AND CROWDER BRING THE STUFF WITH YOU. WE GOT ENOUGH TO BRING DOWN TEN RANCHES. NOW, REMEMBER INSTRUCTIONS. EACH OF YOU TAKE ONE SIDE OF THE HOUSE. I'LL COVER THE FRONT DOOR SO I CAN PLUG THAT STRANGER WHEN HE RUNS OUT. WHY, THEM DIRTY RATS. COME ON, WE'LL GIVE 'EM A RECEPTION. YOU READY? LET 'EM COME. ( gunshot ) I WONDER WHAT'S HAPPENED? HELLO, TOUGH GUY. FIND BUNCH OF CUTTHROATS, TRYING TO BURN DOWN A GIRL'S RANCH. YOU WON'T GET AWAY WITH THIS, MY MEN WILL-- YOUR MEN ARE ALL ASLEEP, JUDD, TAKE A LOOK. WE JUST HEARD A SHOT-- WHAT'S THE TROUBLE? THIS HOMBRE AND HIS THREE PALS WERE GOING TO BURN DOWN YOUR RANCH, MISS BETTY. NO! THERE'S THE PROOF-- KEROSENE AND RAGS. WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN BURNED ALIVE, IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR YOUR FORESIGHT. WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO THANK YOU, SON. THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT. WHY ARE THEY SO ANXIOUS TO GET RID OF US? I'LL HAVE THE ANSWER TO THAT WHEN I FIND OUT WHO'S GIVING THEM THEIR ORDERS. JUDD'S NOT SMART ENOUGH TO BE THE BIG BOSS. WE'LL HOLD THEM HERE UNTIL AFTER DARK, AND THEN WE'LL TAKE THEM INTO TOWN. THAT WAY, IT WON'T ATTRACT SO MUCH ATTENTION. ( knocking ) KINDA LATE, SHERIFF, BUT I DON'T THINK YOU'LL MIND. GOT A LITTLE BUSINESS FOR YOU. WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS? THESE TWO JUMPED US AS WE WERE RIDING PAST THE WALTER'S PLACE. WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE WITH KEROSENE AND RAGS? LOCK 'EM UP, SHERIFF, UNTIL WE CAN ARRANGE A TRIAL. BY WHAT AUTHORITY ARE YOU TELLING ME WHAT TO DO? THIS GUN--YOU WANT TO ARGUE WITH ME? WELL, SINCE YOU PUT IT THAT WAY. OPEN UP THAT CELL. NOW, I EXPECT THESE MEN TO BE HERE IN THE MORNING. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? JUST WHAT I SAID. ARE YOU INSINUATING I MIGHT BETRAY MY OFFICE? THAT'S WHAT I'M INSINUATING. YOU KNOW, THAT STAR YOU WEAR ON YOUR VEST IS REMOVABLE. WHO'S GOING TO REMOVE IT? MAYBE THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTY WILL HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THAT. GOOD NIGHT, SHERIFF. PLEASANT DREAMS. THAT WAS A GOOD NIGHT'S WORK-- NOW WE CAN GET SOME SLEEP. NOT SO FAST, FUZZ. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WE'VE STILL GOT WORK TO DO. OH, CHEY, I-- COME ON. WELL, THIS GIVES US A GOOD VIEW. GOOD VIEW OF WHAT? THE STREET-- THE JAIL, IN PARTICULAR. WE'LL JUST WAIT HERE A WHILE. WHAT FOR? BECAUSE I DON'T TRUST THAT SHERIFF, AND I WANT TO BE AROUND IF MY HUNCH IS RIGHT. IF I'D A KNOWED THIS WAS GONNA BE AN ALL-NIGHT PICNIC, I'D A BROUGHT MY BLANKET ROLL. RELAX. WE MIGHT HAVE A LONG WAIT. WAIT? NOTHIN' MORE CAN HAPPEN NOW-- AH-CHOO! NOTHIN' MORE, EXCEPT ME CATCHIN' A COLD. SORRY, FUZZY, BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS WE'VE GOT TO DO, AND WATCHING THE JAIL IS ONE OF THEM. ( mumbling ) WAKE UP, FUZZY, IT'S DAYLIGHT. OH--MY ACHING BACK. ARE YOU SATISFIED? NO, I'M NOT. WE'LL WAIT A LITTLE LONGER. DOGGONE IT, CHEY, WE COULDA HAD A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP. HOLD IT-- TAKE A LOOK. WHY, THAT DIRTY, DOUBLE-DEALIN' SHERIFF, LETTIN' THEM CROOKS GET AWAY! COME ON, CHEY, LET'S GET 'EM! WAIT. THEY'LL GET AWAY! THAT'S WHAT I WANT 'EM TO DO. COME ON, WE'LL FOLLOW 'EM. ( knocks in code ) Boss: GET IN HERE-- I GOT A FEW THINGS TO SAY TO YOU FOOLS. THIS IS WHAT I FIGURED WE'D FIND. LET'S LEAVE THE HORSES HERE AND GET CLOSER. BUT HOW WOULD WE KNOW THEY'D BE LAYIN' FOR US? I PAY YOU TO THINK AS WELL AS SHOOT. YOU KNEW THAT STRANGER WAS AROUND, YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN PREPARED FOR HIM. WE GOT EVERYBODY OUT BUT THE WALTERS GIRL AND A COUPLE OF OTHERS, AND I AIN'T GONNA BE STOPPED NOW. Let's jump 'em before they can pull their guns. Let's wait and see if they mention Grayson. WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP? GET THAT MAN IN BLACK. WHAT'S THE MATTER? SCARED? I AIN'T SCARED, BUT HE'S A SLIPPERY CUSTOMER. NOW, DON'T GET ME WRONG-- I'M NOT BACKING OUT. YOU BETTER NOT BACK OUT. AH-AH-- ( muffled sneeze ) You want to have the whole bunch out on us? I can't help it-- got cold, stayin' up all night. MY ORDERS TO YOU ARE TO GET THE MAN IN BLACK, HIS PARTNER, AND THE WALTERS GIRL. I WANT IT DONE IN THE NEXT 24 HOURS. RIGHT. AH-CHOO!! I THINK I KNOW WHO THAT IS. ALL RIGHT, BOYS. SEE WHAT YOU CAN FIND OVER THERE. COME ON, BOYS. ( gunshot ) LET'S GET TO THE HORSES! WE'LL HEAD AROUND SUNSET ROCK. WELL, LET'S DO SOMETHING-- IT'S GETTING WARM AROUND HERE. WHEW! THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE. YEAH, NOW WE CAN GO LOOK THAT SHACK OVER WITHOUT BEING DISTURBED. MAYBE WE CAN GRAB THE LEADER. NO, HE'S TOO SMART TO HANG AROUND THERE, BUT I'M HOPING HE LEFT SOME CLUES. HEY, UH, THERE'S UNCLE BOB. SO IT IS. I'VE BEEN LOOKING ALL OVER FOR YOU FELLAS. I JUST BEEN TO TOWN, AND THEY TELL ME JUDD AND HIS GANG BROKE OUT OF JAIL. WE KNOW--WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO TAKE A LOOK AT THEIR HIDEOUT. THE FELLA THAT GIVES 'EM ORDERS WAS THERE A COUPLE MINUTES AGO. I'M GOIN' WITH YOU. NO, GET BACK TO BETTY-- I DON'T WANT HER TO BE ALONE. RIGHT. I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYBODY HOME. I'M NOT TAKING ANY CHANCES. LOOKS LIKE THE BIRD FLEW THE COOP. I DON'T THINK WE'LL FIND ANYTHING HERE. I'M NOT SO SURE-- DO YOU SEE WHAT I SEE? THAT'S NOTHIN' BUT A BUNCH OF OLD SPUR MARKS. WHEN WE FIND THE MAN WHOSE SPURS FIT THESE MARKS, WE'VE GOT THE LEADER OF THE GANG. MAYBE YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING. FIND ANYTHING IN THAT SHACK? NOT A THING. THEN WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHO'S GIVING JUDD HIS ORDERS. I'VE BEEN THINKING, AND I'VE GOT A SUSPICION. WHAT IS IT? GRAYSON--WHAT'S THE ATTRACTION IN BUFFALO GAP FOR A BIG-TIME GAMBLER LIKE HIM? HE'S HERE FOR SOME REASON. MAYBE YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING. I HEARD HE GOT TO TOWN JUST ABOUT THE TIME THIS DIRTY BUSINESS STARTED. WHAT DO YOU THINK, UNCLE BOB? WELL, IT COULD BE. FUZZY, I'VE GOT AN IDEA. IF IT'S GONNA GET ME IN TROUBLE, I DON'T WANT NOTHIN' TO DO WITH IT. YOU'RE GONNA DO A LITTLE GAMBLING. NO SIR--NOT ME. COME ON, QUIT STALLING. DON'T RUSH ME-- I GOTTA THINK. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR YOUR PARTNER, HE'S NOT COMING. WHY NOT? HE MET WITH A LITTLE ACCIDENT JUST OUTSIDE OF TOWN. LET'S PLAY CARDS. I-I GOTTA HAVE A DRINK FIRST. HEY, BEN. GIVE THIS OLD GEEZER A DRINK. OLD GEEZER? I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW-- WHAT DO YOU WANNA DRINK? GIVE ME A DRINK OF WATER. WATER?! WE AIN'T GOT ANY. IF YOU'RE CALLIN' ME, PUT IN YOUR CHIPS. LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT. FULL HOUSE. HA! NOW I'M GONNA LOOK FOR MY PARTNER. NOT SO FAST. I'M TOPPING YOU. HEY! THAT'S THE SIXTH TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED-- YOU'RE CHEATING! WHAT DID YOU SAY? I SAID, YOU MUST BE CHEATING. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ACCUSE PEOPLE. WELL, I STILL MEAN IT. PROVE IT OR FACE THE CONSEQUENCES-- HE'S MY PAL. MAYBE I CAN PROVE THEM, JUDD. HEY, CHEY, YOU ALL RIGHT? YEP. YOUR MEN NEED SHOOTING LESSONS, CROWDER. PUT UP YOUR HANDS, EVERYBODY. JUDD, DROP YOUR GUN. FIRST POKER DECK I EVER SAW WITH ALL TOP CARDS. YOU'RE PRETTY HANDY' WITH THOSE CARDS, GRAYSON. WHAT OF IT? WHAT'S YOUR CUT ON THIS RACKET? ALL RIGHT, YOU'LL TALK LATER. I'M ARRESTING YOU ONCE AGAIN, JUDD, FOR TRYING TO BURN DOWN THE WALTERS' RANCH. YOU TOO, GRAYSON, FOR-- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH ME? YOU'LL FIND OUT-- GET ON YOUR FEET. WHAT HAPPENED TO JUDD? HE GOT OUT THE BACK DOOR-- SHOULD I GO AFTER HIM? NEVER MIND, WE'LL GET HIM LATER. COME ON, GRAYSON. ( gunshot ) TAKE COVER, FUZZY! WHERE'D IT COME FROM? NEVER MIND THAT, I WANT GRAYSON TO TALK BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. GRAYSON-- GET HIM INTO THE HOUSE. I'LL GO FOR A DOCTOR. IT'S TOO LATE-- I'M FINISHED. WHO SHOT YOU? MUST HAVE BEEN JUDD. WHY? THEY WERE AFRAID I'D TALK. I GUESS THE BOSS DIDN'T TRUST ME. I TOLD HIM YESTERDAY I WAS FED UP WITH ALL THESE KILLINGS... I DIDN'T MIND THE GAMBLING. WHY DID THEY BRING YOU TO BUFFALO GAP? TO HELP CLEAR OUT THE SETTLERS, PUT 'EM IN DEBT SO THEY'D LEAVE. WHAT WAS YOUR CUT? HE PROMISED ME A SECTION OF LAND, SAID HE WAS GONNA BE KING-- KING OF THE WEST. WHO IS HE? I THINK HE'S CRAZY. WHO IS HE? HIS NAME IS-- HE'S FINISHED. CHEY, I'M WORRIED ABOUT UNCLE BOB. WHEN'S THE LAST TIME YOU SAW HIM? YESTERDAY, AFTER YOU LEFT. SAID HE WAS GOING DOWN TO THE SOUTH LINE TO FIX A RAIL, I HAVEN'T SEEN OR HEARD FROM HIS SINCE. HAS JUDD OR HIS MEN BEEN AROUND? NO, DO YOU EXPECT THEY WILL BE? YOU NEVER CAN TELL WHEN A RATTLESNAKE'S GONNA STRIKE. I'M AWFULLY WORRIED ABOUT UNCLE BOB. DON'T WORRY, BETTY, WE'LL FIND HIM. ( horse approaching ) UNCLE BOB, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? YES, BUT ONLY BY GOOD LUCK. THE GANG JUMPED ME AND TOOK ME TO THE SHACK. THEY WENT LOOKIN' FOR YOU-- THAT'S WHEN I MADE MY GETAWAY. GRAYSON HAS JUST BEEN KILLED BY THE GANG. GRAYSON! WHEN? RIGHT HERE, A FEW MINUTES AGO. DID YOU GET ANYTHING OUT OF HIM? NOT MUCH--HE DIED BEFORE HE COULD NAME THE LEADER. WHAT ARE WE DOING TO DO? IF WE HEAD FOR THE SHACK, I THINK WE CAN TRAP THE BOSS-- HE SAID HE WAS COMING BACK. DID YOU SEE HIM? NO, HE KEPT OUT OF SIGHT. IT'S TIME FOR A SHOWDOWN. WE'VE GOT TO CAPTURE THIS MADMAN BEFORE HE DOES ANY MORE DAMAGE. WE'LL TAKE GRAYSON'S BODY TO TOWN AND HEAD FOR THE SHACK. I'M GOING WITH YOU. IT'S TOO DANGEROUS, BETTY. THEY KILLED MY BROTHER-- THIS IS MY FIGHT, TOO. LOOKS LIKE THE PLACE IS DESERTED. WE'LL GO IN AND HAVE A LOOK AROUND. I BETTER STAY OUTSIDE TO KEEP GUARD. FUZZY WILL GUARD OUTSIDE-- YOU COME WITH US. THE BOSS WAS RIGHT-- HE SAID HE'D GET THEM TO THE SHACK. NOTHIN' WE CAN DO TILL THE BOSS SHOWS UP. MAYBE THERE IS-- COME OVER HERE. SEE THOSE? SPUR MARKS. I NOTICED A VERY FUNNY THING. SPUR MARKS CAN BE LIKE FINGERPRINTS WHEN IT COMES TO TRAPPING A KILLER. I'M WEARING ONE TYPE OF SPUR, BETTY'S WEARING ANOTHER, AND YOU'RE WEARING STILL ANOTHER. I THINK YOU'RE WEARING THE ONES THAT FIT THOSE MARKS! CHEYENNE! YOU'RE CRAZY! THERE'S ONE WAY WE CAN BE SURE. SUPPOSE YOU SIT DOWN AND PUT YOUR FEET UP, SO WE CAN COMPARE THE MARKS. THAT'S RIDICULOUS. WHAT'S THE MATTER? AFRAID THEY'LL MATCH? NO...I AIN'T AFRAID. ( hears commotion ) YOU'RE A SMART MAN-- IT'S ME. UNCLE BOB, HOW COULD YOU? YOU HEAR THAT? I HAD NOTHIN'-- ME, THE FIRST MAN OUT HERE, ME, WHO SETTLED THIS TERRITORY. IT BELONGS TO ME, NOT ALL THE LANDJUMPERS THAT MOVED IN. IT'S MY LAND, AND YOU NOR NOBODY ELSE IS GONNA KEEP ME FROM GETTIN' IT-- ( gunshot ) I KINDA FIGURED IT WAS YOU ALL THE TIME. DID YOU HEAR THAT? THE BOSS MUST BE HAVING TROUBLE. LET'S GO, WE'LL SURROUND THE PLACE. I'M SURE GLAD YOU WERE ON YOUR TOES, FUZZY. I'M TAKING YOU IN. WE GOT COMPANY! COVER THIS MADMAN, BETTY-- THEY'RE SURROUNDING THE SHACK. YOU AIN'T GETTIN' AWAY ALIVE. NEITHER ARE YOU. FUZZY, TAKE A WINDOW. KEEP LOW AND DON'T LET HIM TRY ANY TRICKS. AH HA! THAT PUTS ONE OF 'EM OUT OF THE WAY. YOU GOT AN IDEA? YEAH. WE'LL STOP FIRING, AND THEY'LL GET CURIOUS AND COME IN TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED. WE CAN TRY IT. BETTY, STRETCH OUT ON THE FLOOR AND DON'T MOVE. FUZZY, GET BEHIND THAT DOOR AND KEEP YOUR GUN READY. YOU--GET IN THAT CHAIR OVER THERE. GO ON, MOVE. NOW REMEMBER, YOU'RE COVERED-- ONE WRONG MOVE AND YOU GET IT. HERE'S THE DEAL--WE PLAY POSSUM TILL THEY GET INSIDE. THEN FUZZY, YOU TAKE 'EM FROM THE BACK. IT WON'T WORK. IF IT DON'T, YOU'LL BE THE FIRST TO GO. THEY'VE BEEN QUITE FOR NEARLY FIVE MINUTES. THEY'RE EITHER DEAD OR PLAYIN' TRICKS-- WE'LL FIND OUT WHICH. IT'S THE WALTERS GIRL, SHE'S DEAD. ( knocking in code ) HEY, BOSS, EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT? Say yes, have 'em come in. ALL RIGHT, BOYS, COME ON IN. DROP THOSE GUNS AND REACH! I'M COMIN' AFTER YOU, JUDD. YOU'RE FINISHED, JUDD, DROP THAT GUN. HERE I COME, JUDD. I GUESS PETER NEVER THOUGHT HE'D BE A PRISONER IN HIS OWN JAIL. THAT'S JUST WHERE HE BELONGS. BESIDES, WE'VE GOT A MUCH BETTER SHERIFF NOW. HEY, FUZZY. HEY, WHERE YOU ALL GOIN'? WE'RE GOIN' UP TO SUNSET ROCK TO WATCH THE MOON COME UP. BY THE WAY, HERE'S A PRESENT FOR YOU. WHAT'S THIS FOR? TO KEEP YOU AWAKE, SO YOU WON'T GO TO SLEEP ON THE JOB. ( alarm rings ) AAH!
