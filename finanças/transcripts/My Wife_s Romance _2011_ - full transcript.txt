RITUALS OF MARRIAGE I'm ready. All right. From the beginning. I woke up, showered, got dressed. I went downstairs, to make breakfast. It's been our little ritual since we got married. When I saw he didn't come home, I got worried. He's always on time. The dog returned without him. He was spooked. He was shaking. I went looking for my husband in the area. I walked to the woods where he goes running. I tried his cell, his work. Nothing. That's when I called Mr. Chollet. And you. Any idea what could've happened? He's been despondent lately, having trouble sleeping, easily frustrated. He drank. How come? He's having problems at work. What kind of problems? Anything specific? No, he never talks about work. I don't know what goes on in his firm. - Does he pay the bills? - Yes. Did he mention receiving any threats? No. - How long have you been married? - Five years. We've been together for 6 years. - How old are you? - Twenty-five. Do you have any children? - No. When he went running, did he have anything on him, like a watch, rings, money? No. Nothing. What about his ID, credit cards? He left them at home. Any distinctive markings, like scars or moles? Yes, he has a mole on the right side of his chest, and 2 scars on his neck he got from a boil. We scoured those woods. Your husband's not there. We found no evidence of foul play. With easy access to the river, the road, - he could have left, or... - Or what? You think he's dead, don't you? We can go now. I'm sorry. I didn't know you were religious. I am when things seem hopeless. Like everybody else. I can't bring myself to pray, even when things are hopeless. Maybe you've never been truly hopeless. I buried my wife last year. I'm sorry. I didn't know. You've had 6 years with Paul. I had 25 years with my wife. And for you, unlike me, there's still hope. I know how you're feeling. I'm sure it'll end well. In my practice, I've seen cases like this before. In fact, 4 or 5 years ago, when Paul was still at my firm, one of my clients disappeared. Model husband, father of two, a responsible, sensible man. One day, he left work to go home for lunch, but he never made it home. The police found his car one week later. They found him a month later in a dingy hotel room with his mistress. I don't mean to imply... I'm sorry, that was tactless. Can I offer you something to drink? That would be nice, but I think you need some time alone. Here, I have some homeopathic sleep aids. It can't hurt. Take 3 before bed. I'm sorry to have imposed on you. Don't worry about it. It's too bad it took these circumstances... What I mean is, it had been a while. Yes. Since Paul started his firm. I better get going. You know where to reach me. Call day or night. Thank you, Counselor. ...been vacant for over 4 months. Mr. Rivas had a lot of debt. We've just... - Can I help you? - Wait, that's Mrs. Rivas. This was Paul's firm. It's been vacant for 4 months. - I'll leave you the keys. - Thank you. It's not possible. Paul left for work every day. He came here. His desk was right here. Here, there was an old chest of drawers, with an antique vase on top. There was a carpet here, and a painting on this wall, and that one as well. Those were all valuable pieces. Maybe he has another office. Not that I know of. Do you have a place in the city? Where did he go all day? We don't know any more than you do. We're doing everything we can, but it's going to take some time. - Thank you. - Goodbye. - Mrs. Rivas? - Yes? - Are you with the police? - Not exactly. - Let me start over. Hello. - Hello. We're bailiffs. Your housekeeper wouldn't let us in. We've been waiting for you. How can I help you exactly? We'd like to speak with Mr. Rivas. He's not here right now. In that case, we'll have to do without him. - Shit! - Go get some water. Francois, call 911. Mrs. Rivas? Mrs. Rivas, can you hear me? I'll give you some privacy. Hey buddy. What were you up to today? You don't want to talk about it? You can tell me. Just killing time? Here. I'm your lawyer, Michel Chollet. Your doctor sent me. I'm like an intelligent dog. I understand everything. But I don't talk. Nice to meet you. All right. You are suspected of being complicit in a 1996 hold-up in Tajikistan. Last month, the Tajik judicial authorities sent us evidence of your involvement in order to have you extradited. You are being charged under the Tajik criminal code, and face a minimum prison sentence of 7 years. I've spoken with your wife, who had a lot to say, but I wanted to hear from you. I'm no stranger to the system. I'll have done 11 years in jail, a total of 4 sentences. During my last visit, my wife gave me an ultimatum: Either I stop, or she leaves me. I chose her. We left Tajikistan to get a clean start. We've been here for 6 years. A few months ago, I got a call. Some old friends needed a favor. You can imagine the nature of this favor. I turned them down. Then all this started. Are you saying you didn't play a part in the hold-up? Not exactly. I've done a lot of bad things. They just had to dig a little. The people are hyenas, they're relentless. I want to go home to my wife She will stay here. I'll never see her again. That's why I need a good lawyer. I need to say goodbye to her. - Can you help me? - I'll try. Miss! Calm down! - Let me go! - Calm down. Let me go! - Calm down, miss! - Let go! I want to die! Come in. Hello, Eve. How are you feeling? You knew about everything. No. Not everything. I knew Paul was having some financial problems, but I had no idea it was this bad. You had said Paul had a bright future. It's true. I did. I was wrong. You know Eve, some people, although talented, need help to thrive. Those people languish when left to their own devices. When Paul left me to start his own firm, everything started off so well. I even sent him some clients every now and then. Divorce cases, estates, that kind of thing. He hired an entire team, rented a luxurious office in a nice neighborhood. Then something snapped. He lost one case. Then another. He started losing his clientele. And in our profession, if you lose 1 or 2 big clients, it's a slippery slope. I tried to continue helping him, but the people I had sent him didn't want to deal with him. He got addicted to living the high life. He sank deeper and deeper into debt. Did he have a mistress? For what it's worth, I came to get you out of here. If that's OK with you. I'll be waiting for you downstairs. Where are we going? First order of business: lunch. - You've lost too much weight. - And then? I'll bring you home. Do I still have a home? It didn't disappear on you. Of course you do. This is a huge sum. Are you crazy? Possibly. - You've paid off all his debt? - Yes. And I transferred you some money to get you back on your feet. You should have asked me first. How can I possibly pay all this back? It's not a loan. I can't accept this. Why not? Because I'm afraid of you. Men never do anything for free. - What do you plan on doing then? - I don't know. I'll find a way. I didn't grow up rich, you know. Unlike Paul, I can tighten my belt. But never again will I be dependent on someone. I'm just trying to help. As for the money, I can afford it. I can't leave you homeless. I'm a better man than that. Excuse me. Allow me. I'm going to my cottage this weekend. I'd love for you to join me. You think I need protecting. Some fresh air would do you a world of good. You're so unpredictable lately, I'm afraid to leave you alone. You should have sent me in the psych ward. Wash your hands of this. Your mind is too sound. They don't take just anyone. I need you in one piece for Paul. Let's stop talking about Paul. All right. As you wish. I've recently realized I have a conscience. In my profession, that's rather unfortunate. I have to learn to live with it. I could have intervened, stopped his decline. You're not like other lawyers. Call me Michel. Thank you for the flowers, Michel. - Hello? - Alexandre? Speaking. Who's this? Eve. - Did I wake you? - No, no. Eve. - You're surprised. - Why would I be surprised? I'm sorry I didn't recognize you right away, it's been ages. - Like, 7 years. - Six. Give me a sec. It's good to hear from you, Eve. I often think about you, I wanted to look you up, but... Suffice it to say, I'm so happy you called. I was going through some things and I happened upon your number. Do you still live at the same place? - Nothing's changed? - Everything's the same. More or less. And are you still so beautiful? I don't know about that. I'm sure I've changed. You used to be so carefree, but now you sound sad. Maybe that's why I didn't recognize you. I lost my husband. - I'm so sorry. - It's OK. - Was this a while ago? - No, just recently. He drowned himself. I'm so sorry. Let's talk about you. You're married, I'll bet. I sure am. - Do I know her? - No. - And kids? - Two. A boy and a girl. We named our daughter Eve. In my honour? - It's not a coincidence. - Thank you. I'm touched. I never would've thought... Have you forgiven me? Let's not bring up the past. What's done is done. Yes. Would you like to meet up? I'd love to go for coffee or something. Do you really think it's a good idea? You're the one who called... Just for old times' sake. OK. For old times' sake. You're still 18 in my mind. I'm curious to see the woman you've become. How about Aux Coleurs? - That is, if it still exists. - Yeah, it's still there. Everything's the same there. Even the waiters. They're a bit older, sure, but they're still there. Let's say tomorrow, 11 AM? Are you crying? No. I mean, yes. See you tomorrow. Perfect, see you soon. Thanks for calling. Don't be sad. - Thank you. - Goodbye. Hello. Is Alexandre here? You're Eve? Haven't you hurt him enough? Don't come back. Thank you. - This is delicious. - Thank you. It's nice to see you smile. You're beautiful when you smile. Jane and I used to come out here to contemplate the scenery. This was our favourite place. How did she die? We had a son. An only son. I didn't approve of how he lived his life. We couldn't see eye to eye. I was unfair towards him. And he killed himself. After that, Jane just... She lost the will to live. I'm so sorry. Don't be. It's nice to talk about this to someone. I'm sorry. - Yes? - Were you sleeping? Give me a minute. Can I talk to you? It can't wait till morning? This won't take long. - Did I offend you? - No. Why on earth would you think that? When you spoke about your wife and son, I felt sorry for you. You're all I can think about lately. The world I knew fell apart. I couldn't find anything to hang onto. Then you appeared and held out your hand, asking for nothing in return. At first, I didn't understand. But now, I do. You're a generous person. A good, sensitive man. Paul was my life. I thought I knew him. Obviously, I didn't. It turned me upside down. I became afraid of everything. I was afraid I'd never be able to trust again. Here. Thank you. I love you. I know I shouldn't be tellling you. It's just that... It's not that I need to hang on to something. But... You're the one I love now. You're being irrational, completely irrational. I understand what you're going through. Right now, you feel the need to move on. I just so happened to cross your path. But trust me, these feelings will go away. No, they won't. - I know myself. - It's absurd. What does age have to do with it? I mean, the age difference... What about Paul? What if he comes home? It wouldn't change how I feel. He's dead to me. It's my heart, do you understand? No. My heart's hanging by a thread. I can't allow myself to go down this road. You're so young, so beautiful. You could kill me. I'm terrified of you. Don't you want to get better? I do. But I'm too far gone. I've outlived my wife and my son. It's too much for one man. I'm sorry Eve. This may be selfish and cowardly of me, I want to live, just a little longer. Even if I only have at most 4 or 5 years left. But we can be friends. Good friends. True to one another. Goodnight. You are to appear in court tomorrow. You were right. A lost cause. You will be escorted from the courtroom directly to the airport, and you will be extradited. But, as requested, you are free until tomorrow. How did you do that? That's for me to know. Thank you. I'll see you in court tomorrow, 10 AM. Don't be late. Your knee. Very good. Straighten your back. Two. Three. Plie. Now extend. Madame, your husband is here. Excuse me. Your client and his wife committed suicide. - How? - Monoxide poisoning. Hello? - Hi Eve, it's me. - Hi. Is this a good time? Absolutely. I was hoping you'd call. - Really? - Yes. Good. What's going on? I'd like to see you. Could I come by your place? Yes. - See you soon then. - Definitely. Hello, ma'am. How are you? What's wrong? Nothing. Then why are you sad? Do you feel guilty. No. It feels strange. I got married at 20. I haven't been with anyone else since then. Are you having regrets? I haven't decided yet. You know, sometimes it's OK to compare. I didn't know you were pretentious. Bring your things to my place. Hello. Over here. Take everything. Come in. The police are here. Could I come in for coffee? - If you want. Here. Do you recognize it? It's the vase from Paul's office. I had picked it out. We've had it appraised. It's worth a small fortune. But the problem lies elsewhere. We've uncovered documents from your husband's firm. Piles of documents and hard drives. Go on. They point to your lawyer. Why retain him, of all people? - How long have you known him? - A long time. He was Paul's professor in university. Paul also worked in his firm for a few years. He launched his career. Do you have a personal relationship with this man? Not really. We had supper once. and I'd bump into him at networking events. That's all. You weren't thrown off by his generosity? - You know about that? - Of course. From the horse's mouth. Generosity doesn't even begin to cover it. I still can't believe it. Can you tell me how your husband came to work for him? - It's a long story. - They're my favorite kind. I'm all ears. Paul had trouble finding work after university. We had to return to his hometown. A small place in Picardie. There was only one firm there that would have him. With his degree, he found it degrading to work there. They treated him like shit. And of course, the pay was bad. We had to struggle to make ends meet. Then one day, Mr. Chollet came to town, for business, so they made plans to get together for supper. But at the last minute, Paul had to stay at work. so I went to supper in his stead. Paul received an offer to join his firm shortly after. Upon your request. No, not at all. It was Mr. Chollet's idea. He could clearly see that Paul was fading away in that place. And you know, Paul was one of his best students. He wanted to give him a break. Why are you asking these questions? We discovered something about your husband's bankruptcy. Really? What? It was orchestrated. By Chollet. Chollet referred two big clients to Paul's firm which he then made him lose. He'd occasionally send along minor cases, - to keep suspicions at bay. - Do you have any proof? No hard evidence. He's an experienced lawyer. He covered his tracks well. He went through third parties. Nothing involves him directly, but I'm feeling optimistic. That's impossible. He and Paul were close. Based on what's happened since, I gather you and Chollet are something of an item. Are you spying on me? I think you're the reason Chollet set all this in motion. Chollet rescued Paul from hardship, gave him a taste for money and power, and then he took it all away. Paul fell hard. When Paul fled, Chollet emerged a hero. You were all too willing to be saved. That seems pretty far-fetched. And you don't know the whole story. While he's busy scheming, tragedy strikes. His son commits suicide, his wife dies, but everything's already in motion. He'd forgotten you, but you were drawn to him. According to plan. He still managed to ensnare you. - I don't believe you. - That's fine. I understand. For now, it's still just a theory. But, if you'd be willing, with your collaboration, we could... Leave. Please. And stop harassing me about my husband. - Why's that? - Leave. Thank you for the coffee. I apologize if I offended you. Unfortunately, it's part of the job. I almost forgot. You said you went looking for your husband on foot, but the car engine was hot when we arrived on the scene. - I said that? - It's here in your statement. I guess I misspoke. I was in shock, can you blame me? My husband often ran long distances. I took the car to look for him. It's 2 km to the woods. I'm assuming you questioned the housekeeper. Yes. - She confirmed this. - Yes. Good. I won't say another word without my lawyer. - I have no more questions. - Good. I'll see you soon. You weren't answering the phone. Did something happen? No, nothing. Why didn't you come? That's why you're here? I changed my mind. What do you mean? I thought you wanted this. What do you want? I changed my mind. I'm not going. I don't understand. What happened? A lot of things. We're going to discuss things like this, outside? Come in, then. You were right about the age difference. We have different interests. Want a drink? No, thank you. And what if Paul comes home? You said you were done with Paul. You said he was dead to you. So? We had six years together. I'm going to wait for Paul, dead or alive. We can talk about "us" then. If I'm not dead by then. I have maybe five years left to live. Why in five years? Paul could show up well before then, you know. Be serious. Tell me the truth. What's going on? You wanted to be friends. We'll be friends. Yesterday you say one thing, today another. You can't do that. All right. Goodnight. Night. Thank you. Listen. I'll be blunt. I have no one. No one in this world. When I am gone, which will be soon... As you know, I'm not long... To summarize... You'd receive a large inheritance at my death. This is a copy of my will. The notary has the original. Here. Read it. Would this satisfy you? And in return, I'd have to sleep with you? Don't be so vulgar. I'd have to live my life knowing that I killed you. Wonderful. You'll kill me if you turn me away. I'm quite serious. That's blackmail. I told you I was like this when I am in love. You want me to leave, is that it? Meaning what? You know exactly what that would mean. I went to the morgue this morning. To ID a body that was fished up 50 km from here. Was it Paul? No. It wasn't Paul. The body was horribly waterlogged, but I know it wasn't him. Then I had a chat with the police. And? He said you orchestrated Paul's bankruptcy. And that you did it to be with me. Is it true? You believed him? That's his theory. One of his theories. He also thinks you and Paul want to kill me for my money. It's absurd The guy is paranoid. But even if it's true, it changes nothing for me. In return for all my earthly possessions, I ask only to taste your love. To live a few days to the fullest. What did we drink last night? What didn't we drink, you mean? Thank you.. I don't feel very good. And I've run out of my meds. Could you run down to the pharmacy across the street? You want me to call an ambulance? No. But please hurry. It'll pass with the meds. Goddamn it! Eve? Hi. - Alexandre? - Where you heading? I need a pharmacy. It's an emergency. Thank you. I forgot today was Sunday. All the pharmacies are closed in this area. It's such a coincidence. What were you doing here? Where are we going? What's going on? Why did you call? I don't know. I was unwell. You only think of me when you're unwell? Eve. I fell apart when you left me. Part of me died. I wasn't able to love again. But I was learning to cope, pretending to be alive. I pretended to love my wife. My kids, my friends. I pretended to enjoy life. I had almost fooled myself into believing it. Then you called. You shattered my hopes and dreams. What am I supposed to do now? How can I go on pretending? Why are you so quiet? Say something. I'll come see you. Tomorrow, after tomorrow, whenever you want. But right now, you need to bring me back. My friend is dying. He has a heart condition. He needs his medications. Right now. Damn it, look at me! Hello. I'll get these ready. Hello? - Paul? - Eve. It's done. - He's dead? - Yes. That's great, Eve. You did great. - I missed you so much, I... - Wait. I never want to see you again.
