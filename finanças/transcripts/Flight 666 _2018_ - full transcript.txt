All right... You're the Sprite, right? Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, cabin crew, please remain seated. Looks like we got a ways before we break through this thing. We're gonna have some rough air coming up. We're gonna leave the seatbelt signs on for the time being. So just sit back, relax. And we hope to see sunnier skies here in a bit. Hope to punch through the storm shortly. And again, please remain seated and keep those seatbelts fastened. Everyone, thank you so much for your patience. We'll restart beverage service once we reach clearer skies. Did you check the ATIS? I want to get a read on the weather report. See when we might break through this thing. In sports, the international... Why doesn't your dad smile in photos? He never has. Yeah, but... but why? Oh, I don't know. Just not his thing. Even in my baby photos, he would just like hold me and just be like... Probably something I did. As a baby? Mom looks happy. Did they hate me? They hated me. They did not hate you. That's just how they are. - You're just saying that. - No, no. See, I love you. And because I love you, they love you, too. And even if they hate your guts, they're still 2,600 miles away. - Well, Raisinet loved me. - Mm-hmm. I'm sorry. It was fun. Yeah, and this shit going on in my brain doesn't matter. Thank you for asking me to come. It was perfect. Yeah? And thank you for smiling. Yeah, my pleasure. Anything? No change. Looks like it's unavoidable. Projections are all over the place. Precipitation patterns are screaming MCC. But that can't be right. Great. It's like this thing is following us. It's 25A. And it's your turn. Yes, sir? What can I do for you? Can you please tell the pilot to not crash the plane? Thanks. I assure you that he's already considered that. Are you on the same flight as me? Can I get you something? My medicine? It's in my bag. Sure. Is it in your carry-on? Do you know which bin you... No, no. My suitcase! Oh, sir, if you checked your luggage at the airport, we can't get to it. It's in cargo. No, no, no, no. Don't you have access to that? I mean, what if it's an emergency? Sir, I'm sorry. I can get you a headset or pillow, blanket. I can get you some water. How can I relax knowing that we could crash any minute now? Hey... Oh! What a little heartbreaker! - How old is she? - Almost four. Oh, what a great age. I wish I could see the look on her face when she sees you. I'd be happy to see any look on her face. I've been overseas deployed for 24 months now. The only thing I could think about was her and her mom. Are you a soldier? Yes, ma'am. Army Ranger. So how much more time do you have left? Well, I was delayed in Paris. The only flight out was to LAX. So we got five hours to New York. And then an hour car ride. And I get to see my family. You're adorable. - She's adorable. - Oh, I'll say. They're getting restless. Yeah. Well, hopefully, we break through this before they get "restless" restless. Well, we're about to start service. So does anyone need anything now, though? Oh, yeah. Can you pass me one of the blankets, please? Yes. Here you go. You're too nice for this crew. Thank you, Liam. Don't worry. I'm supposed to have it. Sorry. I wasn't worried. I'm lying. I was worried. Name's Thaddeus. U.S. Air Marshal. Anna. Nice to meet you. Likewise. Flight Deck? Can I get you guys anything? No, I think we're good. Thanks, Alice. Everything good back there? Mostly. We had one passenger ask that you guys not crash the plane. Hadn't thought of that. All right. Well, let me know if you guys need something. Just ring. We will. Thanks. Everything all right back there? Yeah, yeah. Seems good. Alice was just checking in. It would have been nice if JFK had given us a heads up on this storm before takeoff. Oh, I don't think they knew about it. I never seen a storm this big creep up out of nowhere. We should have been able to eyeball this thing the moment we were off the ground. Yeah, these domestic red-eyes are a nightmare, too. I've done my fair share. But after a while, I start, you know, needing some daylight. Any tips? All the coffee in the world, my friend. All the coffee in the world. Any plans for New York? Absolutely. Got a hot date. The most beautiful woman you've ever seen. - Oh, yeah? - Oh, yeah. What's her name? Don't know yet. Blanket make things better? Maybe. I don't get people who are afraid of flying. Like if you can't do it, why try? I don't think it's the flying. I think it's being stuck in a compressed metal tube that resembles a penis while thinking about falling and exploding. That's not an image I want to think of. What? A giant penis? Or the falling and exploding? Both. Were you ever afraid of planes? I'm afraid of a lot of things. But flying isn't one of them. Being up here, it's a beautiful thing we do. And look at us. Up here in the darkness where no one can see us. Still majestic birds after all this time. How long has it been? Like three years, girl. Please? I'm busy. You're shameless. - I'll get the next one. - Oh my God. It's just... - What happened? - No, no, there's something... - I saw... - What? - On the wing! - Sir, please take your seat... There's something out there! - Sir, calm down. - Easy, man. You need to take a breath! I saw something! Calm down, please. Sir, the storm has everyone shaken up. Sir, please, please, please take your seat, okay? - Calm down. - Come on. I can assure you that there's nothing like that out there, okay? Take your seat. You need to calm down. Okay, okay. I just need... excuse me. Oh, sir, I'm sorry. You can't use the bathroom. The captain hasn't turned off the seatbelt sign. Sir, don't close the door! You okay? Everything's fine, everyone. Everything's fine. Excuse me? What's happening? It's just nerves. It happens. The storm has everyone shaken up. Literally, I take this flight all the time. This is the worst I've seen it. Do you live in Los Angeles? No, my parents do. We were just there on vacation. We're heading back to New York... Brooklyn. Actually, it was a late honeymoon, really. Oh, well, congratulations. Thanks. Let me ask you something. So what happens when a passenger's more out of control, like more than that? Generally, these situations resolve themselves. But we have protocols in place for extreme situations. Yeah, man. That's scary. As I said, these situations usually resolve themselves. Nothing to fear. Oh, it's just the storm! It's just the storm! You're seeing things! It's just the rain! The turbulence. Sir! Sir! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! - Sir! - Let me out! Let me off this plane! I can't be on this plane! Sir, please calm down! I can't be on this plane! Get me off this plane! She tried to grab me. Who tried to grab you? A woman! A woman in the mirror! - A woman in the mirror! - Excuse me! - Get down! Get down! - Liam, call the captain! Need any help? No! I'm an Air Marshal. Everything's fine! Back in your seat! Everyone back in your seat, please! - What happened? - I don't know. I think he's having a panic attack. I'm not having a panic attack! I saw something! Stop! No, no, I saw something in the mirror! Okay, I'm going to have to restrain this passenger 'til we get to JFK. Do you have anything to calm him down? Yes, but we've never given... Whatever it is, grab it now! Grab it now, grab it now! Hey, are you sure you guys don't need any help? Everything's fine, okay? I'm a U.S. Air Marshal. Back in your seat! Everyone back in your seats! Oh my God, he's a terrorist! No! I'm just dealing with somebody who's a little detached from reality right now. Miss! I really need you to hurry! I can hear you people! I'm not a terrorist! How am I a terrorist? I'm not making this up! You have to believe... Here we go. Swallow! Swallow! Swallow, that's what we right there, okay? Swallow it. Swallow it. That's what we want. Right there, okay? We're okay. Now we're good. Now we're calm. Now we're calm. Are you tying him up? Got to keep him under control. We still have a lot of time left on this plane. I don't want him waking up and freaking out, okay? Okay. - We can get him up right now. - Okay. Come on. Come on, come on. Okay, everybody in first class, I need you to get up. And move to the back of the plane right now, please! - Everyone out. Come on. - So sorry. Sir, this way. Ma'am. Ladies, you too. Thank you so much. Okay, go ahead, sweetheart. Thank you so much. I am so sorry... The passenger that was giving us the issue has been restrained. He's been medicated. Thank you so much for your patience with us. I think that the flight should return to normal now. Again, I'm so sorry. You okay? That's what we want right there. Everything's okay! All right. You can't interfere in stuff like this, Bran. What? I just wanted to help. Yeah, I know, but this isn't something you should be involved in. Okay. I'm sorry. I guess I'm still in my head about my parents. I don't know what their problem is. You said it was okay. I believe you. I always believe you. - Yeah? - Yeah. Maybe next time, it'll be better. Yeah. I hope so. This storm is huge. It's blanketing everything. Five minutes ago, it looked like we'd be out of it in 20, but... At least the altimeter and fuel gauge are working. Lightning screwing with us? Yeah, looks like it. But it shouldn't be doing all this at once. Flight Deck. Captain, it's Liam. The storm caused a passenger to freak out. The marshal stepped in and assisted but we had to sedate and restrain him. Restrain him? Is everything under control back there? I think so. Okay, good. Just make sure everybody's comfortable. The storm is the only thing I wanna worry about right now. Got it. Okay. Here you are, ma'am. Sir, what can I get you? - Just a water, please. - Okay. Miss? I was wondering if you had anything else I could snack on. I had the peanuts and this gentleman gave me his. But my stomach is still rumbling. Oh, we're gonna start the in-flight meals as soon as the storm dies down. Oh, okay, but is there anything you can do? If I get you one of the prepackaged salads, - would that help? - Great. Okay. All right. Shh. Here you go. Thank you, sir, for sharing your peanuts. Of course. You think he saw a ghost? No. I mean, I think he probably thought he saw one, but come on. Yeah. Probably just crazy. You know, I think I saw a ghost when I was little. Really? I mean, maybe. You know, you see things you don't understand like walking down an old hallway and you see someone out of the corner of your eye. But you look and they're gone. Or you're driving and there's someone behind you. You look for them and then they're just gone. Is that ghosts or just other people? Okay, like this one time, I remember being in my bed at night. Lying on my side, looking out my window at this line of trees that's behind my house and I was blinking a lot 'cause I'm trying to go to sleep. And there's this guy that walks out of the woods. A guy? He looked like Frankenstein. But that's probably not right. He started walking towards the house through the backyard straight towards my window until I could see the whites of his eyes and then he just stood there and looked at me. No shit. What did you do? I freaked out. I ran to my parents' room. Woke them up, told them I saw a guy in my window. And then my dad, he came in and looked around, but there was nobody there. They even went into the backyard. They said I was dreaming. Were you dreaming, though? You think? I don't remember falling asleep or waking up. I mean, I don't... I don't think you saw a ghost, babe. I think you saw creeps. I don't know. Have you ever seen one? No. But I have seen an angel. Okay, you know that's not gonna get you out of my happy wedding conversation, right? All right, worth a try, worth a try. I know. - Cool it. - All right. You know, if you give someone a salad during a storm, we'll be picking crouton crumblies off the floor for hours. I know, but she was very cute. This has been a flight, huh? I know. I hope that's the worst that will happen. Well, we've got Charles Bronson over there keeping watch. We should be fine. You okay? Okay, all right... Need some help over here! Oh, my God! Ma'am, are you all right? - You bring a towel! - Yeah. Napkins! Anything! Okay. Can you breathe? All right. She's coming back. All right. The hits just keep coming. Here you go. Let's get you back in the seat. There you go. Get up. Easy, easy. I think it's in my hair. Check the other salads! Go! Jesus! Flight Deck. Hey, sorry to bother you again... Pan US57. Be advised, you're rapidly approaching a low-pressure system. It will be difficult to continue tracing you at... This is PAN US57, over. We're losing you. PAN US57, over. Pan... 57... Repeat. Advised... rapidly low pressure... system, will be difficult ...to track you. Liam, what's going on? Our in-flight meals are, well, they're rotten, I think. Rotten? They're like Satanic rotten. Full of maggots, actual maggots. That is disgusting. The in-flight meals are rotten. Great. Have Liam call LAX. Tell them about the food. Captain says to call LAX. Let them know about the food. There's not much we can do from up here. So just try and keep the passengers as comfortable as you can, and worst case, we'll take care of them we land. What did he say? You keep everyone comfortable. The phone's not working. We're running out of ways to keep them comfortable. Seriously, bring on the frogs! What? What else was there? Locusts? Darkness? Yeah. Bring on the... Ryan, go for shoulder straps! No power to the engines? That's gotta be a technical bug! No way we got struck! No thrust! Altimeter's out! All right, we have to keep the nose up in this glide! You got eyes on the horizon, Ryan? I'm trying. I can't tell if it's up or down right now. All right, keep your eyes out there. Wait for a lightning strike! Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! JFK center, this is Pan US 57! We've got dual engine failure! I repeat, all engines out! Going for an engine failure systems check! - Ryan! Anything? - No... Come on! We're in aerodynamic stall! We are dead stick! We've got to get the APU fired up or we are up a shit's creek! Auxiliary's not working. Shit! 30 degrees up! Copy that! Pull back with me! We gotta get this nose level! Let's go! Come on, come on! We're still dropping! We need to get the engines working! We get 'em spinning, the generators will run! What about the RAT? Well, we're too far out. Not gonna work. Fire, damn it! Connect! Come on, fire, damn it! Connect! Connect, damn it! It's now or never, Jack! We're at the point of no return! Hold on. Hold on! Please work, please work. Please work, please! Here we go! Come on, pull! Thank God. Flight Lead, please contact the cockpit. Thank you. Good work. I've never seen a plane die like that before. I have, but not like that. Looks like you're getting to see a lot of things you never seen before tonight. Jesus Christ, I think I almost had a heart attack. Okay. Can you start the walkthrough? Yeah. You okay back there? Sir, you okay? How we doing over here? Yeah, I think so. That was a lot. How about everyone else? Any injuries? I don't know. I haven't started the walk-through yet. Copy that. Looks like we're about 4:10 till we hit New York. Just try to keep everyone calm and comfortable. And let's see if we can make this a better trip from here on out. Last thing we need is a plane full of angry people. Okay. Thank you so much. Yes? Oh, sweetie, that looks bad. Oh, my God. Why don't we touch you up in the restroom? I'm not qualified for this. Thanks. Yes, sir. Thank you. Are you okay? My apologies. They're doing everything they can. Ladies and gentlemen, apologies for the turbulence. As you may have gathered, our aircraft experienced a brief loss of power which caused the drop in altitude. But everything's back in order. Good news is, planes are made to handle situations like this. We hit a rough patch of sky. But it's our number one priority to get you to New York, or wherever your final destination may be with us this evening, safe and sound. Hoping to have you on the ground in just about four hours. So just sit back and try to relax. We'll be sending the flight crew through the cabin to make sure everyone's okay. Once again, we apologize for the discomfort. On behalf of the airline and the crew, we hope you enjoy the remainder of the flight. Hey, why... why am I... It's just a zip tie, okay? - Zip tie? But... - Shh. You had an episode. I had to restrain you. - All I'm saying... - It's for your own good. But... No, no. You don't understand... I'm gonna tell you one more time! Listen to me. You have the right to remain silent. And if I were you, that's exactly what I would do. All right. - Relax. - Okay. JFK Center, PAN-US 57. LAX Center, PAN-US 57? We've lost contact with JFK. Do you copy? Shit, I can't get anyone. They were updating us on the pressure systems. This all happened after we lost power. Keep trying. They'll come back. What about the systems check? I've ran through the book. The plane can fly. But after the outage, we got a few problems. According to the diagnostics, the cabin pressure's good. Fuel's good. Landing gear... Landing gear is out. Coms are down. And autopilot's gone? - Yeah. - Okay, well... This plane may not be brand new, but it's one of the greatest ever built. Keep our hands on the wheel, we should be just fine. What about FMS? What happens if, for some reason, we lose navigation? You've never flown one of these things before, have you? Through a storm with engine failure? Not really. Keep calm, kid, all right? I've been through worse than this. Keep your head on. What's ATIS saying about the weather report? Well, still surrounded. Even if we wanted to divert our path, according to the data, there's no way around it and we're stuck in the middle. I can't see anything out there. Look, equipment, no equipment, radio or no radio, storms only last so long. We'll be through this shortly. Your head. Keep it on. I'll do my best. What? Oh my God! What? What's going on? Hello? Hello? Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am? Ma'am, can you hear me? Ma'am? Can you let me know that you're okay, please? Help! I can't get out! The door won't open! Somebody, please help me! Ma'am? I'm sorry ma'am, the lock override is stuck. I can't open the door from this side. I can't get out! Help me! Ma'am? Can you... Can you let me know that you're okay, please? I can't get out! Hello? Ma'am, please. Ma'am? Please. Okay, someone's coming to help, okay? Please just stay calm. If you can hear me, stay calm. What's up? I think that there's a woman trapped inside. She's stuck? Yeah. The locking mechanism, isn't working properly. All right, here. Let me try. Okay. Ma'am? Ma'am? This is the U.S. Air Marshal. I need you to open this door right now. Your right, the lock override switch seems to be jammed. We need something to pry open the door with. Oh, okay, we have, um... Oh, great. Um... There's a killer on your plane. All right. Ma'am, on the count of three, I want you to push the door open from the inside, okay? What? What? I don't understand what you're saying! There's a killer. One, two, three! Oh my God. Oh my God. Okay. Come on, sweetie. Come on. Come on. Okay, okay. Shh, okay. Okay. This way. Yeah, can you take a seat for me? Good girl, good girl. What happened? The mirror, the mirror! What about the mirror? I saw her. She was pregnant. I couldn't breathe! That doesn't make any sense. We're gonna get you to your seat, we're gonna get you comfortable okay? Can you stand up for me? Come on, okay? It's okay. Shh, shh, shh. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay, all right? It's okay. Thank you. Go ahead, take a seat. What is going on? Seriously. We're never flying this flight again is what's going on. No, I'm serious, Bran! Okay, that guy freaks out, there's maggots in the food! - Hey. - No, no. People are throwing up, the lights are going out in the plane. People are getting hurt, And that poor woman, I don't know what's going on! I know. I don't know either. We're in a... hey, we're in a hell of a storm, okay? And storms pass, all right? - Are you okay? - I thought we were gonna die. You're not gonna die. The Air Marshal said that the crazy one was a terrorist. Okay, ma'am, he didn't say that. I think he actually said the opposite. Hey, what are we supposed to do when there's a crazy person on the plane? I mean, what if he hurts somebody? Okay, well, maybe we shouldn't call him crazy? And what's this talk about ghosts? Okay, nothing, right? It's just... We're all just a little frazzled right now. It's a malfunction, a malfunction of the plane. That's it. Look, all I know is you better keep that man away from me. 'Cause I just want to get on the ground. You know, maybe we got struck by lightning, you know? I mean, that explains the power going in and out. Lightning hits planes in the air all the time. What? Are you a mechanic? No, I'm a teacher and I watch the news. Okay, you know what? Cool it, all right? We're in a storm, okay? We're on a plane. The plane is a machine. If you so much as use your cell phone, the signals get jumbled, all right? So if we're this high up covered by clouds surrounded by lightning, of course, some shit's gonna go wrong. So, please stop making accusations if you guys don't even know it's true. You'll only make everyone panic. Exactly. Everyone just take a deep breath. Sit back and try to relax. Are you sure everything's normal? No, I'm not sure, but it's not supernatural. We're on a plane and planes have problems. Something's not right, Bran. I know, look. How about we take our mind off this? Like music maybe? You still haven't listened to the mix tape that my brother put on your phone in L.A., right? I don't know. I don't know. It feels weird. Okay, okay, babe, babe, babe. We're in a storm, but storms pass, okay? Now if I open my carry-on and snakes fall out... I'll be the first to let you know, okay? - Okay. - Okay. Hey! Listen to me! You're really stupid if you think I'm letting you out of my sight. Relax! Revenge! He wouldn't stop! Did you say something to me? What? I thought I heard something. Where are you? Please help! So dark down here... Okay, did you not hear that? Hear what? There's someone trying to call me or speak to me or something. What? What am I trying to hear? I don't hear anything. - Brandon? - What? Nothing. Murder! Shit! Did you mess with my volume or something? No. Oh, my God! Did you sit on it or something? Jesus! No! Are my ears bleeding? Danika, what's going on? You're scaring me. My... Hey. Captain? What the... Alice, there's procedure for a reason. You can't just barge in here like that. Look, three hours and some change, we'll be on the ground. That's what I'm worried about. That's what we're all worried about. We're losing this flight. I need you to take control now! I'm sorry? So far, we've had a lightning storm, rotten food. People having panic attacks. And then losing power? I don't know what this is but it isn't normal. She's got a point. Look, Alice. I need you to calm down, okay? It's a rough flight. But you've been doing this long enough, you should know. All right, I don't know what's going on back there. I have no idea what the problem is. But I can't be back there to fix it personally. I'm doing everything I can to keep us in the air! Yes, sir. I... Oh, I know you're trying and you're doing a great job. It's just we're doing all we can up here. Sorry, Alice. Yes, sir. I understand. Look, I'm not trying to be a hard-ass here. It's just that, if we can all make it through this flight without losing our minds, drinks are on me. You seeing this? See what? What is that? Up there in the clouds? Are those birds? Uh, that's impossible. Birds don't fly at this altitude. Well, then what in the world... Are those people? What are you talking about? Captain, I... I don't see anything. You're not seeing this? Right here! I swear to Christ! People? Uh, you want me to take over for a minute? Maybe, you know, I think a break might do you some good. Maybe some coffee or something? A break? No, I don't need a break. Shit! A bottle of water, please, Alice? Jack, there's no shame in being exhausted. It's a red-eye direct coast to coast. And look at what we're flying in. I know. I'm just... Scared? Yeah, me too. Yeah, maybe a little. I don't know. Something's not right. Something just doesn't feel right. Your hands have been shaking. Are they? Didn't even notice. I guess I just got a lot on my mind. Thanks. What'd you see? I don't know. Make sure this stays open, okay? Dani? Brandon? What? I don't feel well. What's going on? Would you think it was weird if I thought there was something else on this flight? Is it like your Frankenstein thing? No. I'm not following. Dani? Dani? Honey, hey! Dani! Are you okay? Do you have aspirin? Uh, yeah. I think there's some in my carry-on. The killer... There's a killer on this plane. I... I... I don't know what's happening! There's a killer on this plane! There's a killer on this plane! There's a killer... Dani? Dani! Hey! Hey, babe, hey. You're okay, you're okay. Look at me, look at me. You're fine. You're okay. You're okay. Come on. Okay, come on. You're okay. Come on. Come on, honey. It's okay, it's all right. What happened? Get it away from me! Get what away from you? There's nothing there. Baby, look, there's nothing there. Dani, look, look. Look, look. There's nothing there, babe. Hey! How about you two quit freaking everybody out! We're not trying to freak anybody out! Guys, keep your voices down, all right? This is not making it better. In fact, it's making it worse. - This is some bullshit! - Sir... I'm just trying to calm her down! Better? What did you see? A woman, I think. She was dead in the bin. Stuffed in there! I opened it and she grabbed me. And I know there's nothing there but it looked and it felt so real! I believe you. - You do? - Yeah. Something's going on here. We just need to find out what. Hey, is she all right? Uh, yeah, I think so. I'm fine. I promise. I just don't know what's going on. All right, I'm done. Look, excuse me. I'm gonna go to the bathroom, all right? You really don't wanna go to the bathroom! Oh, great. Mr. Crazy Man's awake. Please don't say it, okay? There are no terrorists on this plane. Look, Mr. Marshal. Come here. Why don't we just tie her ass to the chair and... Sir! I won't let you tie her down! Whoa, whoa, whoa! No one's gonna get tied down to anything, okay? You keep her calm, you got nothing to worry about. Right. I just don't understand, okay? I don't understand what's going on. I don't understand what's going on with my wife. Look, nobody knows what's going on. But the one thing that I do know is that I trust the man with the badge. And the gun? Look, there's a lot of crazy unseen shit going on here. I don't know what it is. But I do know that this woman here has to be detained! Hey, hey, hey! Enough. Easy! Enough! Listen to me. We are just trying to get back to our families just like everybody in this place. Get to your seat. Just get to your seat. Hey, enough! Enough! I said in your seat now! Sit down! Hey! In your seat now! Now listen up! I need everyone to keep their head on their shoulders! Let's stay calm, okay? Now I don't think it's terrorism. So let's stop using that word. That word just gets everyone worked up. - Yeah, but what if... - Don't! Whoa, whoa, whoa. What? Are we in North Korea now? We can't express ourselves? Really? Are you serious? Look, I'm sorry. I'm not usually this much of an asshole. I just wanna get on the ground! Hey! Hey! Look, it's scary when the plane malfunctions. It is. But we are people who do this for a living. So let us do our job and we will be fine. See? That's exactly what I was saying, malfunction. So what are we talking about here? Gas leak? Loss of cabin pressure? I didn't say that. How much longer until we get to New York? Are we gonna be okay? It's just gonna be a couple more hours, okay? We're almost there. Miss? Could you please check in with the captain? Make sure all the mechanical issues are in order, please? What do you think is going on here? We are losing electricity often. It's a good place to start. I'm no mechanic. But I'm sure the captain's doing everything he's supposed to be doing on his end. Most important thing is we're still in the air. We got that going for us. Fantastic, fantastic. Finally, somebody that knows what the hell they're doing. Hey, sir, you keep talking like that, the two of us are gonna have a real serious problem. So I need you to sit here and keep your mouth shut. You got that? Yeah. I'm so sorry about all this. Hey, hey... Hey, don't be sorry, okay? You didn't do anything wrong. I don't know what's happening. Did you take the aspirin? Of course, but I wouldn't... Don't worry, sweetheart. You all do realize that if there is a major malfunction while we're in the air during a storm, that's worse than ghosts, right? Because that can actually kill us. Okay, the plane is not haunted. That's an insane theory. Look, why don't we just land the plane and check for problems on the ground? Look, has the captain mentioned anything about when and where we're gonna land? From what I can tell, the storm is making it hard to get anywhere. I mean, at this point, trying to land in this, we're safer up here. Excuse me? What about the storm? Do you have any idea when it'll be behind us? No. I mean, at this point, the storm's blanketing everything. It seems to be tracking with us. - Excuse me! - What do you want? It's not electrical. We need to do an emergency landing now! It's real! What's real? Look, we can't land until the storm clears up, Alice! - You know that! - We need to land it now, Jack! Alice, what's going on? It's ghosts! The plane is haunted! Again with this? Ryan? Look, we're all tired. No, no, no, no. You need to listen to me! You don't know what we just saw. This lady down in the aisle! You're the only ones that didn't see it! Will you maybe sit down for just a little bit? I'm getting worried about you. We're gonna be on the ground in like 95 minutes or... No, listen! No! The longer that we're up here, the longer the lives of everybody up here - is in jeopardy! - Yeah? Where do you want me to land, Alice, huh? Our coms are out. The storm's been on us since takeoff. We're on our own with nowhere to go! The plane is haunted. Would you listen to yourself? We're not gonna land the plane because you're superstitious! I mean, why would ghosts want to haunt this plane? For revenge. Excuse me? What did you say? Revenge! Ryan, leave your belts on. Ryan? Ryan... Revenge! Ryan! Stop! Ryan, stop! Stop! What are you doing? In your seats! Ryan, what are you doing? Stop! Hey, hey, hey! Get off of him! You okay? You're not flying autopilot? No. We lost it when the plane lost power. What the hell happened? I'm so sorry, Ryan. All right. I don't know what the hell we just saw. But something's definitely wrong. We agree on that, right? I mean, you said there's something physically wrong with the plane, right? No, not anything that's gonna cause hallucinations or visions. I don't know what would cause us to see the things we saw. Okay, well, let's start from the beginning. So the storm started soon after takeoff. Precheck was fine. Luggage was fine. Mr. Peck in 25A... Yeah, poor guy. And Mr. Peck claimed that he saw something unusual on the wing of the plane and then he went to the bathroom to cool off and then he got spooked again. Well, I know what I saw in the bathroom was real. The woman in the bathroom, she was in the mirror and she was reaching out for me. And then I fell through the floor. I couldn't get the door unlocked. Me either. I tried, but I couldn't. It felt like it was being held from the inside. We checked it, though. I mean, there's nothing physically unusual about it. Okay, then the plane lost power and we fell. And then the food was spoiled somehow. I heard a woman scream through my earbuds. Scream? Scream what? At first it was whispers. Then it got louder. It sounded like she said, "Murder". Well, then that's when my phone stopped working. Mine too. I thought I was the only one. And there was something really weird on my screen. What was it? A sonogram. A what? You know, like when you take pictures of babies from a pregnant lady. That woman in the aisle. And then Ryan going crazy and attacking Jack. Then the corpse in the overhead bin. And now someone's written "murder" on the outside of your window. Okay, so what are we looking for? And where do we even start? I mean, it has to be coming from around here somewhere. Well, it all started in the front of the plane. But I already checked the bathroom, though. And we've been up there most of the flight. That wouldn't explain the phones or the overhead bins. Or what happened in the cockpit. We're so screwed. No, we're not screwed, guys, okay? Listen, we just need to find the source to what the hell is going on right now. Ryan? Where am I? I can't move my hands. It's on purpose, kid. - What happened? - You attacked Jack. What? You got crazy eyes and went straight for the throat. Why would I do that? All right, listen up. I know it's been a crazy night for all of us. But there has to be a perfectly reasonable explanation for all of this! There are only so many places to look. If not the cabin, the front or the back, what else is there? Okay, well, we decided that it started on the wing. And now we have that word written on his window... Yeah, but we can't check outside on the wing right now. We're in the middle of a flight. What about the manifest? Is there anything onboard that's out of the ordinary? Nothing that I know of. No special packages from museums? No dead soldiers being transferred at home from Afghanistan? Brandon? What are you saying, man? I mean, objects could be conduits for spirits. Okay. Maybe there's something on the plane that's traveling with it. Okay, so if there's nothing on the manifest, what do we do? What were you saying? When? When you said you fell through the floor, where did you go? Um, I don't know. The cargo hold, I think. Why? Because I saw that too. When I fell back against the seat and then I was in the cargo hold. Babe... There was someone there. And I don't... And I don't know, but... I felt like they needed my help. What... What are you saying? There's something... something happened. Something bad. We have to go down there. Babe... If we are having visions of the same thing in the same location, something is telling us to go down there. The luggage. Speak up. The luggage. I don't know what's going on. But talking about it isn't going to solve anything. Like she said, we need to go down there and see for ourselves. If I find out you had something to do with this, you are in a big world of hurt. Do you understand that? How? How? You tied me and put me in a chair. Cut him loose. Yeah, cut him loose. Any of us would have freaked out in that bathroom. Miss, would you happen to have any scissors, please? Yes. Thank you. Don't make me regret this. You won't. Ah, God. Okay. Here's what's gonna happen next. You're all gonna go back to your seats and I'm gonna go down to the cargo area and check it out for myself. I'm sorry. Sorry, guys. No one can go down to cargo. Do you want this to come to an end or not? Because I gotta cover all my bases here. - I'm going with you. - Dani... No, you are not going with me. No! It was speaking to me! I saw it! I'm not gonna sit up here and wait for someone else to figure it out! I'm going! No, you're not going! Look, I'm going too. I didn't travel this far to get back to my wife and my kid to not get home now. Now if getting down there finding out what's going on is going to help us all get home, then I'm gonna help you. I have your six, man. I appreciate that. But I'm doing my job right now and I'm going down alone! Dani, you stay here. I'm gonna go with the marshal. Nobody's coming with... Please stop! Just follow me. You guys are gonna have to be quick. I can't see anything down there. That light won't be strong enough. Hang tight. That one will. There we go. What is that? Sounds like a baby. Oh! Guys, what is happening? Sorry! I thought I saw something, but it's gone. This is a nightmare. Oh! - You okay? - You okay? This is bad. Oh... It's leading to that bag. Austin, do you want to grab that? Yeah, sure. Guys? What are they? - Her! - Who? The overhead bin! In the overhead bin! That's blood. Souvenirs. Typical serial killer. Holy shit! What, what? It would be her. Are they all here? Where's the woman that ran towards us and disappeared? Holy Mary Mother of God, that's her. There. This bag belongs to someone on the plane? A killer? Whose bag is this? - That's easy to figure out. - Find out. No way. Captain, I'm gonna have to speak with you about what's been going on tonight. No disrespect, Marshal. But can we do this another time? I don't know if you've noticed, but I'm flying this plane by myself and we haven't really been having a great night. You sure you wanna do this right here? Do what? Talk about the women you've murdered. Murdered? Murdered? You serious? Cut the bullshit! Whoa! You can't talk to me like that! Look, Marshal, whatever you think's going on, we can't have this many people in the cockpit. I'm sure you know protocol. I'm afraid I'm not gonna be able to follow protocol right now, Captain. Neither are they. What is this? We're almost on the ground. Whatever it is can wait till we're on the ground. No, it can't wait. We're talking about this right now! Where did you get these? What did you do to her? I don't know what you're talking about. What is this? Good God! What's wrong with you people? I don't know who this woman is. Don't lie to me! What did you do to her? What did you do to her baby? It's funny how the women in these photographs were the same women causing all the problems on this plane tonight. Also very funny how all the pictures ended up in your bag. Jack.... Captain. I don't... look, these aren't my... oh, come on! Tell the truth! Captain? - Cut me loose! - What? Don't do it! We need somebody to fly the plane, please! Cut me loose! Trust me! Without a pilot, we're gonna die! Hurry! Revenge! Revenge! Hurry! Please! Hurry! Revenge! Revenge! Revenge! Move! Revenge! Revenge! Murderer! Revenge! You know who I am? Get your hands off me! Christ! Dani? Baby? Hey... Come on... Come on. What happened? I didn't... I didn't do it, I swear. Save it. What did you do? I don't know what you're talking about. Let's get her to her chair. - Can you... - Yeah, I got her. I got you. Come on, babe. Hey, hey. Tell me what you did! I didn't do anything! You tell me what you did right now or I will end you where you sit. Look, nothing I did matters, okay? Austin! Okay? None of it matters. You're gonna get everyone killed! Wake up, honey, come on, babe? Come on. No, not everyone. Just you. Oh, my God. No! No! Stop. Please stop. No, no, no, no! It's not my fault! It's not my fault! I didn't mean it the first time! It was an accident! She liked it rough, you know. I did too, so I thought it was okay! We were role-playing! And I guess I just got a little too into it! I was scared the first time! I felt guilty, but deep down inside. I liked it. I loved it. I loved watching the expiration light blink and then fade. It became an urge. A need. Then it became me. I realized I could just fly away and no one would know. And I didn't know how to stop! I just... Oh God, I'm so sorry, please! I'm so sorry! I just... I don't know how to stop it! Forgive me. Please forgive me. I'll do anything. No! No! Brandon! No! Come here! No! This is all your fault! Bitch! Don't... No! No! No! No, no! Everybody, please hang on! JFK Center, PAN-US 57! Do you copy? Damn it! Hang on! Brace! Brace, brace, brace! - Brandon! - I got you! I got you! Shit. We're coming in hot! Hold on! Come on, baby, come on, come on! Come on, come on. Got this... Everyone brace for impact! Are you okay? You okay? You okay? We're good back here. Oh my God. It's okay, it's okay. Hey, hey, it's okay. I got you. I got you. Ryan? Ryan, okay.
