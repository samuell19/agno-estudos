(relaxed rock tones) (relaxed electronic tones) - If you could take a pill that would make you smarter and live longer, would you? That's the promise of smart drugs, a part of the biohacking trend that's blowing up around the world. I'm a futurist, I fly all over the world most weeks as a keynote speaker and media personality. - I'm gonna start with futurist. This is a thing. - Yeah. - This is a profession, this is your profession, what is it? - Yeah, so I got hugely curious about the world of technology. Since the age of 10, I've been on computers. But really worrying about how technology changes the dynamics of how we interact. I spend many hours every day producing podcasts, doing conferences, speaking at places. This is one of the coolest things I think that I've read about most recently. There's this new trend that's gaining popularity right now. It's called biohacking and it's changing how we operate in the world. - We can think of our bodies as computer systems. So why not make every possible effort to optimize our inputs? - So biohacking is a combination of supplements, treatments and smart drugs that make you smarter, stronger and hopes to make you live longer. It used to be the stuff of science fiction depicted in films like "Limitless." But this is real. It's a reality which fuels some of the most successful and creative people in San Francisco. I wanted to find out if they'd work for me. (relaxed electronic music) I travel for work and it gets stressful, especially because I work a lot. But then, so does everyone else these days. It's the new normal. I've always worked a job since I was 13. I ended up like working in sorta laboring jobs and also delivered milk for a living. Maybe it's like a British working class work ethic. I'm no stranger to hard work. I'm still the only person in my family to get a degree. I wasn't always a futurist. I've done everything from development into data science and all the way through to advertising. I started organizing events around technology in the future and it got to a point where I had so much momentum and interest, it was like I'm all in. I'm gonna quit and I'm gonna make this work 'cause I can't work for anyone anymore. In the year of 2017, I've done 50 keynotes. Over 40 flights. I had no time for relationships. I was single for over two years. It was week in, week out, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce and I never stopped. It's like you've been holding your breath for eight hours and then suddenly you relax, but your body's completely shattered. Huh? What? Oh man, I was just about going off then. It was really, really tough and you get to a point, I like to call it peak stress. I've burnt out really bad before, like to the point of thinking that things were gonna go very negatively health-wise. So I'm not gonna let that happen again. (phone ringing) Hello? Hey, Douglas. Hey, how's a going? Hey, it's been busy, I've been flying around. I really need to use new thinking if I want to survive the upcoming speaking season. I decide to look into nootropics, or smart drugs as they're known. Designed to improve cognitive thinking, it would be cool to think that I could maintain an edge on demand. A lot of white collar workers like developers, designers and engineers use this. (relaxed electronic, piano music) The global cognitive supplement market was $2.3 billion in 2015 and that's going to rise to $11 billion by 2025. I thought maybe there's an opportunity. Maybe the smart drugs can help me work faster, do more and not be so tired. And that sort of really started getting me to ask the questions around what can smart drugs do for me? So I went down to San Francisco and Silicon Valley, to the heart of the biohacking scene to check out what's really going on. It's like going to the mecca of technology and new thinking, right? The West Coast, this is where the counterculture really kicked in. It was the birthplace of the personal computer. You just feel that there's a free sort of collective energy around innovation. People are willing to take big chances, funding technologies that are gonna change the world and that's bled through into this cognitive supplement or nootropic market and I think that's really exciting. There's a range of nootropic and smart drug companies out there. One of the most talked about is a company called HVMN. It's gotten a bunch of venture capital funding from some very well known investors. I felt like there's definitely potential there. (relaxed electronic music) - Hey, welcome to our San Francisco office. - Thank you. - Feel free to put your bag down. - Thanks. - You can see our different suite of products from GO Cubes, our chewable coffee. A nickname for this is the coffee that you can't spill. And then you have our mainstay entry into the nootropics space, the Nootrobox Full Stack which consists of two chronic daily nootropic stacks which are Rise and Kado and then what we call like acute nootropics, Sprint and Yawn. - Right. - Sprint, kind of a more intellectualized version of GO Cubes and Yawn, optimizing sleep. - Yeah, let's go for it. - Cool. - Okay, so just take one of these? - Two of those. - Two of these. - Yes. - And these just like help give me that edge, right? - Yeah. - Okay, I got some trepidation about taking these but I'm gonna trust you on this. - Yeah, no, everything that we sell and manufacture is FDA General-regarded safe. So very low-- - Nothing bad's gonna happen to me? - You're in good hands. - Just positive effects right? - Yes. (relaxed electronic music) - Okay, step one. Okay, that's done and then we get into the Kado as well? - Yes. - The Kado-3. - Yes. - Okay, here goes nothing, cheers. - Yeah, cheers. - You know, in a short while I wanna-- - Be in flow state? - Yeah. Flow state, get through some work. Do a bunch of research that I need to get done for the presentations I've got this week. So yeah, this is where I get into Sprint, right? - Yes. - Okay, ready? - Yep. Cheers. - Cheers, so okay, so that's the Full Stack, right? (relaxed electronic tones) - I see the future of biohacking as having just full time continuous controlled understanding of your system. So that to me means that you have a dashboard of all your key bio-markers. Glucose, ketones, things like cortisol, hormones, et cetera and having a toolkit of different interventions that can manipulate those bio-markers. For human ketone for example, I like to tell people to actually do finger sticks to measure blood glucose and blood ketone levels. You actually measure that. The military has always had a very keen interest in enhancing their performance. Our Ketone Ester drink, that technology originated from a DARPA program to develop superfuels to enhance warfighter performance, especially physically and cognitively-demanding missions. Nootropics to me really are an extension of what I think is a core human instinct. I think what distinguishes us with other animals on this planet is our desire to manipulate our environment in more broad and general ways. I mean we're a species that started off as little more than advanced monkeys and we're in these concrete forests now. So I think nootropics extending our ability to conquer and manipulate things with our mind is core to being human. In the 70s and 80s, there was the Homebrew Computing Club in Silicon Valley with weird computer hackers tinkering on silicon parts and I really see biohackers as the intellectual descendants of the Homebrew Computing Club where instead of hacking on silicon parts, we're now hacking on our own biology and I think if we do our jobs right, everyone will incorporate some parts of biohacking in their life. - So I'm going to try these Rise and Kado-3 pills. Let's see if I get smarter. (relaxed electronic music) Hello, dear. - Hey, you. - I doubled down on the Rise and the Kado-3. That didn't really give me anything, you know? I think a little bit of a, like more awareness. It didn't feel super strong and then a little later, I actually delved into the Sprint and it was pretty different, it's got a lot of caffeine in it. It felt super uncomfortable for the first sort of 30 minutes for me, anyway. I've got a quite big reaction to caffeine. It didn't feel too comfortable for me. I wanted to find something that had an immediate effect without making me feel jittery. I knew there were other kinds of supplements that didn't actually include caffeine. I read about Eric Matzner, this rebel alt-thinking San Francisco guy. He didn't want to be associated with other nootropics companies. He's out there running his own race and flying his own flag. - So my office is in the Mission in San Francisco. Hey, Zoe. It is the world's first nootropics store and it's the world's first nootropics store inside a bikini store. (keyboard clicking) Nootroo is my own company. I'm the founder, CEO. I like to be hands on with it and kinda see who's ordering and what they're doing. I like to answer their customer service emails and things and because I can type 150 words a minute, I can just fire off a response three times the normal speed of a customer service agent who probably types about 50 words a minute. The nootropics power me to run it and are something that I take every day as I work on it. So this is a game called Type Eraser and I can measure my typing and I have like an actually score from when I first started, you can see I went from like 85 to like 140 on here, where I've increased my typing speed to what is considered the 99.9 percentile. And this is what biohacking is about. It's taking that thing and measuring it so you can then track your improvement over time. I gravitate towards the fastest cities in the world. About five or six years ago, I was living in New York. I was working on a start-up and when I started back then, there was really nothing but like Mylar bags of powder from China and you didn't know what you're getting, if it's dangerous, if it's been tested and so I started making my own pill. But when you have a scale and you're sitting in the office weighing out powders or something, it doesn't necessarily look good. I also had friends who were seeing my own performance gain, saying "How can I get access to what you have? "This is kind of unfair." So I started making it for my friends and then kinda branched out from there and have come a long way since on the fourth and fifth version of it. (knocking) - Hey Eric, how's a going, man? - Good, how you doing? - Yeah, good. - Come on up. - Okay, so this is it. - Welcome to my solvents regiment area. My day starts with a nootro every day. I mean honestly that's the beauty of a nootro is that you don't have to think about it. I could go for a Gold now. Coenzyme Q-10 is part of the mitochondrial biogenesis chain. This will turn into something called ubiquinol, which will then give off an electron to start the electron transport chain. I like acetyl-carnitine, it works with mitochondria. I like creatine a lot. This thing will make your skin tingle. Ow. Look at this color, see how dark it is? - Yeah. - It's gonna oxidize really quickly. Quercetin's a really nice one. It's like every flower and plant has quercetin in it. This is a really nice synergy with bromelain and these are like enzymes. Now, this is pretty experimental. It was shipped to me off of somebody on the internet. These are peptides for the eye, these are from Russia straight up in Russian. This one has properties with the male sexual reproductive benefits as well. - Yeah. - Because I take so many, I have to do like big handfuls. - Whoa, seriously? So that was like 12, 13 pills, right? This feels pretty extreme. Who is the target audience for this? - We have a lot of customers here in Silicon Valley from all the different major companies. They're working on things that can save people tons of time, that can help connect you with a charity, that can help put you in an autonomous car so you don't risk your life. Everybody that's working on something that can affect the greater society is kind of what I hope to help them achieve so that they're having a greater impact. So they want something that makes it so that their brain and the neurochemical soup that's occurring is at its optimal level to boost their brain. Mind Nootropics and Nootroo, it's a combination of ingredients in what's called a stack. Nootroo Silver Plus which is a stack with phenyl piracetam. (relaxed electronic music) That is mixed with something called citicoline, which is a neurotransmitter for memory formation. As the pill becomes active in your body, your brain starts to fire in a more integrated way. You kinda feel calmer and focused and energized. (fingers snapping) - Good morning. This morning is the one that's gonna really like jazz me up for the day. So phenyl piracetam, so this is true hardcore nootropics. This is where it all began, so I'm kind of excited. At the end of three or four hours of working on a number of different things, I'd realized that the research I was doing was going faster and I actually found that I'd done work that would normally take me like two to three days in that period of time and it was like ah, bingo. Just like a true biohacker, I started my own spreadsheet, entered all my information to see how I was progressing. At the beginning, I was originally skeptical of Eric and Nootroo. He wants to live forever, he wants to live as long as he can, right? So are some of these people crazy? Well you know, here's to the crazy ones, right? That's the mantra of the past like three or four years is like we need to prevent the onset of aging. Some very famous futurists like Ray Kurzweil have got a huge regime around supplements. We're talking like over 100 pills a day now. These guys are onto something. These are some of the smartest men and women in the world. So yeah, let's pay some attention to that, right? (relaxed electronic music) (hard rock music) Okay, I feel pretty hyped up. I've gotta do some stuff now. I'm just fucking buzzing my ass off over here, right? I can't sit down even. I'm like-- - How many of those pills? - Just one. I need a way to be able to like run around and use a laptop at the same time. So maybe that's it, maybe I need to go to the gym and put my laptop on it and go running, yeah. How about right here? Actually I'd much like that. The way that I liken it to is you take all the energy that you've got available to you and you burn it in a very, very short amount of time. So your physicality, your focus. It kinda felt like I could really go bigger. That's really interesting. I normally suck at press-ups as well. Caffeine and some phenyl piracetam. It makes me feel sassy, it's good. A nice buzz, so I'm pretty jazzed for the day. (relaxed electronic music) - Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming Nikolas Badminton. (applauding) - Very much, thank you, okay, ah, okay, people can hear me. How's it going so far? It's pretty good so far today, right? Three people are ready, are we ready? Okay. I actually chose to do a keynote. My friend introduced me on stage and about an hour before, we both did a Gold pill from Nootroo and I don't think I can use it when I'm speaking on stage. People were saying like "Oh, you've got two minutes left." And I had at least 15 minutes left in my keynote 'cause I was talking and talking and talking. I think that's part of like the focused in, 'cause you do, you go into yourself and then you get into the work. But you've gotta have a broader perspective when you're speaking on stage, you need to be a little bit more aware. I need to have that outward- looking vision a little bit more. The Nootroo Gold, it's a big nootropic, like a big, bold red wine and it's quite powerful. So I don't always want that every single day. I've been mixing different pills on my own and all my doctor could tell me was to be careful. Nootropics are like the Wild, Wild West of supplements. A lot of this is unregulated. Maybe I should try something else apart from these pills. There's other ways to biohack aside from taking those things. My friends keep telling me about something called transcranial direct current stimulation and that's where you put electrodes on your head and you run electric current through your frontal lobes that activate your neurons. It seems pretty crazy to me but then people were building their home solutions. I actually found a company in San Francisco called Halo that actually built a product that you can buy to help you do this exactly. - When I first moved to San Francisco, what I told all my friends was it's like Hollywood for engineers. It's amazing, it's where you come if you want to do interesting things. Halo Neuroscience is a human performance company and our first product is Halo Sport. It's a training tool for athletes and it stimulates your brain so you get more out of your workout, unlocking your potential and that's our tagline as a company actually. The biggest, most interesting thing is everything that has to do with learning and attention and memory and focus. We call it cognitive control. Cognitive control basically means getting your brain to do what it needs to do instead of just what it wants to do. - We'll get you started here. Just a couple tips as we're going along, too. Always have your pumps flowing and to keep these things full. - Halo wanted to show me how the headgear works on the brain and to start, they had me do a test that simulates space flight for astronauts. That's totally my kinda thing. - All right, so you got your mouse, you got the controller, you're good to go. - Okay, so here I am, I'm flying. - Zero, zero, one, one. - So that's like my call sign. No one's gonna die, everyone's gonna stay alive. - NASA 504, turn your comm one radio to frequency 127. - Yeah, that's me. Where are the fuel tanks? - 504, NASA 504. Turn your comm two radio to frequency 126-- - Yeah, I'm looking at about six different points on the screen right now. - NASA 504, NASA 504 to frequency 111.600. Lacy 5171-- - We might make it back to earth. - We might do. - Yeah. - Or we'll burn up into a crisp in the atmosphere. - That was your five minutes there. - That was the five minutes there, so how did I do? Are we just gonna see a picture of a burning wreckage? - Overall you had 43% accuracy. - Okay. - Which is lower than we would expect. - So that's not entry into-- - It's not entry into NASA. - It's not entry into NASA, yeah, okay. - All right, so that was your baseline. - Okay. - And now we're gonna get you wired up. What's happening under the hood is something called transcranial brain stimulation and these primers create a small electrical current and enough of that makes its way through your scalp, through your skull to your brain, it helps neurons fire together and that speeds up the pace of learning. - Oh yeah, you can definitely feel a tingle sort of starting to run across. I definitely feel stimulated. It's like drinking five espressos at the same time. That's what it feels like. - UBS-Two-- - We're off then. - You're off and running. - UBS-207. - NASA 504. - Turn your comm two radio to frequency 130.725. Delta 1701. - I definitely feel my concentration being a lot more focused on this one in being able to sorta scan and then stay on top of a couple of things here. I don't think I'm doing too bad. - NASA 504, NASA 504. - UBS-207. - Turn your comm one radio-- - UBS-207. - To 127.450. - Turn your comm two-- - Here's your results from that one. - Okay. - That time you were 61% accurate. Compared to 43 before, so it's a 20% improvement there on the overall. - I was way more focused where I could concentrate into multiple different parts of the screen like I wasn't before, I felt very sort of, it felt really unnatural before and it was like okay, it felt like I was switched on. The headgear I tried isn't out on the market yet but they do have a headset that aims to enhance brain and muscle performance. - My name is Jamize Olawale, a fullback for the Oakland Raiders. I use the Halo Headset to help me increase my speed, strength, power, all that. - What Jamize has here today is called the speed ladder, which can help develop footwork. So as a football player, how does this apply to your hitting a hole or making sure that you receive a handoff with the right timing? - So having quick feet, it's very important. So this helps with that, it helps train your agility, your speed, your foot quickness, your change of direction. - My agility, I'm like six-four and I'm pretty uncoordinated. So this is gonna be interesting. Almost, sorta lost my coordination at the last piece there. He's chasing me, he's chasing me. This is tough, this is really tough. I've put the headset on, I'm feeling the tingle. Obviously it's stimulating the neurons. I'm hoping that translates down into my body. - Yeah, towards the end. - Towards the end, you got it better. - A lot better. - That was good. - Yeah. My legs came undone. So using Halo has inspired me to try other methods of biohacking, like fasting. I've read that can be really good as well. I'm gonna go back and see Geoff and his team at HVMN. They fast regularly and I think I'm gonna try it too. - Fasting has been a huge anchor of our company and really the community of biohackers in San Francisco and abroad. - Yeah. - When we first started fasting two years ago, it was just a few of us at the company and now we have tens of thousands of people in our online communities fasting with us every single week. - Yeah, so fasting meaning not eating for a specified amount of time, like say 24 hours or 36 hours, in some cases even longer. - Yeah, so no calories, just water. - Just water. - Yeah. - Right, okay, so I've never done that before. So I'm sorta keen to try the fasting as well and I think, what can I expect from that? 'Cause I don't do so well when I don't eat. - No bullshit, it's gonna suck when you first do it. I think when I first started fasting, it was hard. Our bodies are addicted to constantly eating something every couple hours and that's based on being driven by carbohydrate and insulin on a roller coaster, up and down, up and down. The reason why we fast is not for weight management or weight loss. We fast because we want to live as long as possible, hopefully forever. And not just live forever, but also be very productive and cognitively focused while we live longer. Especially in our neck of the woods in Silicon Valley, getting that cognitive edge is huge and I think nootropics and fasting are a couple very, very compelling ways to activate those pathways. (light chiming music) - Right now in San Francisco, it's 57 degrees with mostly cloudy skies. - Start a seven minute workout. - Welcome to seven minute workout. Just say "Start workout." - Start workout. I am fairly driven, especially since I've been taking nootropics and specifically working to optimize myself. I've kind of built a daily routine that enhances my motivation and kind of lines me up so that I become task-oriented so that I can accomplish more. An average reading speed is about three to 400 words a minute. College professors at 500. I can read around 800 casually and I can skim over 1,000. Sometimes I worry maybe that I'm too task-focused. That I don't hang enough. I've made a resolution to hang out more this year. To help the biohacker movement, I run a nootropics and optimal performance meetup. We also have just launched a meditation battle league which I'm really excited about where we pit people actually head to head to see who can meditate harder. You guys are battling each other? - Yes. - Allison, you want to sign up to compete here? I'll put you two against each other. - I signed up for this meditation death match and I really can't get my brain straight since I've been fasting. My brain goes in 500 different directions and then someone walks by with a cheeseburger. - Got a little drink, got a little drink. - Okay. - So, you take, there's a Gold one there, so they're different colors. - Yeah. - You said you wanted to try to go against me? - Yeah, let's do it, man. - Okay. I like your-- - We can do that. - Confidence there, you're making me nervous a little bit. All right, if you're taking a Noopept 1, I'll go Noopept 1 too. - Levels the playing field, right? - Level the playing field. Welcome to round one of the meditation battle league. This is a league to help people learn to bring meditation into the real world. So when you're in a meditative state, defined as calm by the headset's algorithm, it'll be quiet, it'll be serene. If you have an extended period of time like that, you'll hear birds chirp and come land next to you and at the end, the score will be calculated based on the number of seconds in a calm state. - Muse is now listening to your brain signals. Relax and let your mind flow naturally. Accept whatever you experience from moment to moment. (birds chirping) - People say "Why would you want "to make meditating competitive? "Isn't that the antithesis of meditation?" And I actually disagree with them that mindfulness meditation is a focus on a singular thing, usually your breath. But in terms of the productivity movement and the biohacker movement, we're using mindfulness to align on our task and so I find it helpful to be able to meditate under pressure. Allison was crushing it over there. The scores for round one is 339 to 111. Congratulations. - Thank you. - We'll bring you back for the championship. Okay. - For this calibration, find a comfortable position. - Good luck. - Ready, place your attention on your breath now. Relax and let your mind flow naturally. Whatever you're experiencing right now is perfect. No need to control or change anything. (soft flute music) - Meditation is supposed to be relaxing. This feels like the opposite. It feels like my body's screaming for food and my brain can't settle down and concentrate. (birds chirping) - Ooh. All right, you ready to see the scores? - I didn't hear many birds chirping on my side. - Didn't hear the chirps over there? 153 for Nik here and 332 for me here. One minute, 46 seconds of calm. - I had one bird though. - You had a bird. I heard you synchronize your bird there. Hey, birds of a feather flock together, you know? It's not about the score, it's about that you did drop into meditation. So you're just skimming the surface. Georgie, did you want to sign up for meditation battle? - Yes, I'm gonna kick your ass. - I'm putting you in the bracket for the end of the year party we're gonna do. - When you goad people, it's like I'm so fuckin' relaxed, man. At the meditation battle, I met a startup tech entrepreneur and biohacker named George. He's also a user of Eric's Nootroo pills. George is experimenting with other optimizing techniques like LSD microdosing and that's becoming popular in biohacking culture as well. - In Silicon Valley, this is a place filled with people who are unafraid to experiment. They will test things on themselves. It's kind of a biohacking capital of the world really. Nootropics is something that I've experimented with. When I'm not using that, I will use Adderall and when I'm not using Adderall, shockingly I'll be using LSD. Tiny, tiny, small doses of LSD, they call it microdosing. Microdosing is taking 1/10th of what is considered a party dose of either psilocybin from mushrooms, it can be LSD, in order to get a tiny, tiny benefit of the drug without going into full trip mode. The way to describe it, it does almost nothing for you. You can't even tell that you're on it. The irony is that you're able to get more done and feel more connected to your work and you're like wait a minute, how did this even happen? - Hey George. - Hello. - How you doin', man? I just wanted to let you know that on Saturday at 11, we're gonna be doing our monthly Wim Hof meetup. - Oh, awesome. - Yeah. - That's where we're gonna freeze our asses off. - Yeah, exactly. - Okay. - Yeah, yeah. Cool, see you then. - George recommended I come down to the beach and meet a couple of his friends at another meetup. We're gonna try out the Wim Hof method, another way of biohacking that uses breath work and freezing cold water immersion. - Good morning, everyone. - Hey. - What are you guys doing? Beautiful day. - What's up, man? - Good to see you, George. How are you? - Good to see you. - All right, ready to get going? Let's do this. So we're doing the Wim Hof breathing technique and to start, we're gonna have four sessions of about 40 breaths each. So each breath should be fully in. (inhaling) And then you let it out at about 70%. In the end, we're all gonna jump into the ocean together and we'll sit there for about five to 10 minutes and soak in and if at some point when you're entering into the water, you feel like you're gonna shiver, just try to consciously block that. All right, so just to begin, take one breath fully in. (inhaling) And then let go, not all the way let go, just fully in. 70% out. Keep going. You might start realizing, if you get light headed, it's perfectly normal. You get some tingling sensations, it's all very normal. Just stay relaxed. So it's the ultimate biohack. It allows you to get into a deeper sense or a heightened sense of meditation which generally might take monks years of having to train through and through this technique, you can actually enter into this really deep state of elevated consciousness in about 10 minutes, which is really magnificent. Five more. Four. Three. Two. One. Last one, fully in. (inhaling) Fully let go. Just relax. (soft electronic music) You're making your blood pH more alkaline, which is really good, it actually cleans out your entire body. So it's like a full body detox. And now the most fun part is jumping into the water, into the cold water. - Yeah, right. - Probably not. (dog barking) - And then just breathe through it and it works out. A lot of the work continues inside of the water. (cheering) - I'm gonna do it every single week. - All right, all right. (clapping) - Yeah, nice job. - It's really, it's insane. Absolutely insane. - It's exhilarating. (grunting) (hooting) Oh, I feel so energetic right now. This is the best cure for a hangover in the world. It's amazing. You really feel that, man. It's a religious experience. - I got a real buzz from the Wim Hof method, so I decided to stay away from the pills and try Halo. Anything to distract me away from these increasingly irritating hunger pains. I just cannot get it working. I just want to be able to put something on my head and it works. Fiddling around running it under water and it almost feels like it doesn't fit the shape of my head. So I'm at a loss with that. I've played with it for a good hour and a half. It's a piece of shit. Maybe you need to chat to the people at the office. I like to plug and play, not plug, fiddle around, continually fiddling around, contact the people, yeah and it's like science needs to be easy if it's gonna help me out. Every car looks like a driving hot dog, a delicious driving hot dog right now. You know, I feel like a Buddhist monk at this point. I feel enlightened. Hungry, very hungry, so very hungry. To top it off, I had agreed to meet Geoff and his team down at the Embarcadero. I didn't realize they wanted me to go jogging. I hate jogging on the best of days and I really hate it now that I'm so, so hungry. Nothing will help me with jogging, nothing. Someone could put a million dollars on that bed and said "You have to jog to earn this million dollars." And I would be like "I'm gonna be over here chilling out. "Whatever." Have you heard the phrase jog on? It's an English phrase. Jog on. It means just get out of the way. Good morning, team. - Good morning. - How's a going? - Good. - Hey, how you doing? - Chilling, what's your name? - Justin. - Justin. - Hi. - Yeah, you made it. - Fast go okay? - No. - How you feel this morning? - I don't feel good, I didn't feel good yesterday. I was really dizzy. - Let's run it off. - Who goes first? Come on, let's go. So we've all not eaten for 36 hours at this point, right? - Yeah, I haven't. - Ugh, solidarity. I'm not sure how these guys do this all the time. I don't run and this feels like absolute torture. If this is the kinda thing you have to do, starve yourself and then run around and exercise to live forever, I don't know, I think you can count me out of that. - Finish live, woo. Yay. - What are you looking forward to eating? What's on your like hit list? - I could eat this chair right now. - Your list of things to eat. - You seem in good spirits, man. - Yeah, you seem fine, we should fast like-- - Last night-- - Another 36 hours. - Last night, I was not in good spirits last night. - It's always hardest before you go to sleep and you're really hungry. - The night before is the hardest. - It seems like, the study seems very narrative, it seems very anecdotal, is there like hard data? - The data on humans, while it isn't tracking people over their lifetime, there is strong data on bio-markers like insulin resistance, fast with blood glucose. Yeah but-- - I'm really hungry. - Yeah, no, I think we're all hungry. - I'm still really hungry. - Of course you're hungry. - I don't know if I'm 100% convinced. - No, I would say that like current Western society is eating for the sake of eating. - Yeah. - They have very unhealthy lifestyles, right? Like we were just talking about they're expected to go to happy hours on workdays. - Yeah. - I think that's unhealthy behavior. Of course if we're in a society where we're starving, yes. Like let's not force people to not eat. But we're in a society of everyone being obese, everyone having diabetes, everyone having metabolic syndromes. - Right. - So yeah. So you could say it's kind of a First World problem that we have here but it is still a problem and it's 1/6 of American health, the GDP due to healthcare. I think that's unsustainable. (soft electronic music) - Another article about fasting clearly with a picture of someone that probably has never fasted in their life and never needs to. I felt awful at the end of the fast. It felt too long and it just felt that it didn't really do much for my body. It made my mind really foggy. It's tough, it's mentally tough and when things are mentally tough and you're trying to use your brain to do mental activities, it seems counterintuitive. I was thinking in the car, I was like why the fuck am I doing this? It doesn't make any sense, it seems like it's a gimmick. Like it's a story I tell my friends to be part of a gang. It's like yeah, no, we're all focused and we get more done and it's like sure, you save some time from going and eating. Doing it for the sake of being part of a technocracy, an ultimate society trying to improve themselves, I don't know, it seems to be disingenuous. I don't feel happier, I don't feel more productive. I don't feel more enlightened. It's not giving me some breakthrough moment. Hashtag, hashtag life, hashtag fasting. Hashtag bullshit. (relaxed electronic music) I came down here to find out more about smart drugs. Not to starve myself. So I broke my fast in a big way and now it's time to hit the road. Busy season is back on. Hey, how's a going? Yeah. Okay Paris, yeah, I can make Paris on the 12th. Who am I gonna be speaking to? I've got a bunch of new engagements. I'm gonna need some of these nootropics to help me stay on top of my game. In the next month, I'm gonna go from Paris to China to San Francisco and from Montreal to Toronto. This is pretty much what my life feels like, it feels like I'm on a conveyor going from place to place most of the time. The nootropics are helping me stay on top of my schedule. But I'm feeling super strung out and I'm certainly not getting the sleep that I need. - What brings you to town, what are you working on? - I'm running an event later today. I just traveled six hours from Montreal. Yeah, I was up at 3:00 a.m. this morning for some reason working and I gotta keep going now. I'm a bit anxious about my talk tonight. I'll need to get a lot prepared for this one, with a little help from my nootropic friends. So I've been tracking what I've been taking on pretty much a daily basis. When I've had tons of work to do, really needed to focus, I've always reached for the smart drugs. As you can see here, I've got like the Rise, Kado and Sprint from the Nootrobox people. Silver's the phenyl piracetam and the Gold is the Noopept. So every time I've done these, I've started off with the Sprint. So I mean it was really rushy, lots of caffeine. Ripped into a Nootroo Silver, amazing focus, it felt really, really good. But then about four or five days later, I decided to get into the Noopept booster and this was the one that just made me think better. Everyone's different with smart drugs and this was the one that's like, oh wow, I'm feeling creative, I'm coming up with new ideas. But on this trip, I wouldn't mind an extra boost. I've heard about an even more powerful smart drug, modafinil. It's prescription, it's something that's engineered a little bit more. It's definitely a focused drug versus a smart drug but it's all forced into that category. (mysterious electronic tones) Everyone's been talking about modafinil, everyone. One of friends was like "If I want to get work done and just "be left alone for two days," they just do modafinil. If they need to code and code and code and code, that's it, everything else just doesn't give them the urgency and the focus that they've had before. Modafinil is a prescription drug and rightly so, but people have been going online and ordering it for themselves for off-label use. It was amazing really. A half hour after taking it, I was intensely zoned in on my presentation. I had new ideas and I was completing it at a way faster rate than I had expected. (keyboard clicking) - So what you working on there? - I'm just writing out the introduction to my presentation. I don't really want to talk to anyone right now. Yeah, that's it. (relaxed electronic music) With hardly any sleep in the last two days, the modafinil is still working. I hope it continues through to this evening. I met another futurist called Dre Labre and he was like me. He came from advertising and data and whatever and now he's a futurist and he goes "I love doing "what you're doing, we should do your events here." It's not straightforward running an event. You have to find a good venue, you have to hire chairs, you have to hire a PA. It's all about keeping it super simple. I would say this would be good, like fours. You have to have backup batteries. You have to then get everything into one place, get volunteers together, you gotta get a camera crew together. This cable should fit in the back of the projector, right? We could use that. - No, because I need to get, what we're gonna do is we're gonna go RCA-- - You have to step forward, right? So yeah, you've gotta really work hard at providing what the vision states to provide to everyone which is a compelling evening of talks. - Let's have some fun talking about the dark future. (clapping) - Thank you very much, good evening. - Hi. - Is that how you say "good evening" in Toronto? I'm being followed by a documentary crew at the moment doing smart drugs and I took modafinil earlier today. So I'm gonna talk really quickly, okay? The kids are all right. And do you know what? The kids are not all right and this whole presentation's around what we should be really aware of. This is the world we've created and it's a happy go lucky place. Social media and networks and selfies. If you're sharing any information about your children from any point in their life, especially pictures, you're stealing your child's right to privacy. Are the kids all right? Well I think it's a countdown and I think it's a countdown to somewhere pretty dark. (applauding) Well, that was an illuminating evening. My talk went off better than expected. I was focused, I was sharp. (chattering) I've been up for 20 hours and the modafinil is still kicking ass. - What's your take on modafinil? - I don't know, I was running around doing stuff-- - What time did you take it? - Around about midday. - Yeah, you'll be up for awhile. It really promotes wakefulness. - Come to think about it, I don't feel tired at all. - Yeah, and at this time last night, you were exactly the opposite. - Yeah. We were out until 9:00, we were at dinner and I was like "Ugh," and I literally went home. (relaxed electronic music) - Hey Nik, so what's, how you doing there? - It's late, I just want to go to sleep. I'm kind of restless though. Modafinil definitely keeps you awake, that's for sure. Yeah, yeah, more than anything else I've tried. It hits you sideways and it doesn't, you know, life feels a little off-kilter and a little bit tweaky. If I'm awake at 3:00, I'll be awake at like 9:00 a.m. and if I'm awake at 9:00 a.m., I'm awake for the rest of the day and then by about 3:00 to four o'clock tomorrow afternoon, I'll be in quite a tough place. I'm probably gonna sit down and do a bunch of writing now. But it's probably gonna be shitty writing because I'm really tired. This is what biohacking is all about which is like you push yourself into situations and places where, you know, yeah. And that's it. Are you guys gonna leave? Or do I have to kick you out? Well, I'm done. I'm done, I don't need this anymore. Au revoir. (soft guitar music) If I have time in my life to reflect too much, sometimes you want to avoid the hard questions you're working on personally. It's like there's pressure, you know? When you're in your 40s and you're single and you hope to have a family and whatever, you put a lot of pressure on yourself to keep yourself busy and then you don't think about those things, right? (alarm blaring) After a whole night's sleep wired on modafinil, I'm late to meet my friend Dre for breakfast. I gotta get a move on. - Hey man. How you doing? - Good, man. How are you? - Pretty good, pretty good. So what's on deck for today? - I wish it was nothing but I've gotta sit down. I've got so many emails that even like one day out of pocket and it's like just like. I've got a couple presentations I've gotta finish. But like, yeah. - You could always just take another modafinil and fire that up again, right? - Yeah, for sure. Do you ever have those days when it's like beautiful outside and all you want to do is close all the curtains? - No. - That happens too often, man. - That's not a good, I think a sunny day should always be inspiring. What does your doctor think about this? Have you told him about this? - Blank faces. - Blank? - Yeah, blank faces. Well no, they just don't know about it. Like doctors, if it's not in their universe of regulation and approval, they give no opinion on it. - Yeah, like how do you feel just physically in terms of just pushing yourself with everything that you've been doing? - The last few days, you know that feeling where you don't know if you're like fully awake or you're super tired but you've got stuff to do and it's almost like you float down the street in a way? The ethereal "Fight Club" moments, you know? Without like the schizophrenia but like it definitely feels a little bit. - Is it worth doing extended periods of hyper-productivity only to have these short bursts of being in a coma? - It's not working, man. That's not working. I've been doing this for a long time and you know, last year I really, really burnt out hard and I'm right on the cusp of burning out hard again. You know what, Dre really made me think about the short term gains of smart drugs. They're okay but they really cost me in terms of my health. I'm feeling pretty stressed and close to burn out again. I've gotta go and find a doctor that can tell me what I'm doing wrong. (light electronic music) I spoke to some of my friends in San Francisco and they told me about a medical doctor that also knows about nootropics and biohacking called Molly Maloof. She looks at the balance of everything from normal functions of the body through to supplement and nootropic regimes that can help me. I really want to go and get some advice from her. - I can think of plenty of ways that people can get biohacking wrong. One of the first things is with fasting. A lot of people fast when they're really stressed out and I'm just not convinced that that's great overall for cortisol balance because it puts your body under a state of fight or flight. - Hashtag fasting. Hashtag bullshit. - Another thing that people get wrong is they stack too many supplements all at the same time and have no idea which one is working. And a lot of people don't test before they take things. They just take things willy-nilly, thinking they have problems. Just like when you're trying to diagnose disease and treat disease, you want to know what the problem is. You don't want to just think you know what the problem is. You want to definitely know what you're trying to work on and then work towards that rather than just try to take things because you think you need them. What I've learned over the last few years and through medical school was that there is actually a science to wellness and optimizing health and that it's just as measurable as diseases and in fact, you can use a lot of the same tools and techniques that you use to interrogate for disease to understand how to optimize a person's body. I've tracked my hormones over time. I've optimized my fertility, my progesterone levels, optimized my thyroid function, I've optimized my nutrition so that it's optimized my skin and my hair. I've tracked heart rate variability consistently and continuously for stress measurements over time, I've measured stress through urine testing. I've measured continuous glucose monitoring for the last year of my life just to optimize my blood glucose levels. And then at the end of the day, I have a reflection practice to try to think about what I want to envision for sleep. I've got some lucid dreaming practices I'm working on lately. I have mindfulness practices, self-compassion practices, I have gratitude practices. So everyone says "Molly, "what are you gonna do when you have children?" And I'm like "I'm preparing for having children." I mean like I fully intend to be a super mom. I mean I've been pretty good at being super at everything else in my life, so maybe I'm just arrogant but I also totally intend to have some help. Cool, thank you. In my routine list, there are things like tracking my food, tracking my supplements, which I take after I eat breakfast. Tracking my exercise, so I either do weightlifting, cardio, yoga. Tracking my relationships, checking with my family. Tracking my goals for the year and then I have my three main goals of the day for work and then I have, do one thing every day that scares you. I was inspired by Tim Ferriss. A lot of people in San Francisco come to me and they already have spreadsheets of supplements that they're already taking and what they come to me for is to help tweak that list, figure out what they're doing right, what they're doing wrong and to sort of offload some of the management of their health. - Molly made me fill out about 23 separate questionnaires about my lifestyle, (chuckles), the shape and style of my stools. A whole bunch of different things, just really trying to ascertain what's happening to my body. (trickling) She also asked me to go and get around about 50 different tests like blood tests, urine tests and whatever. It was pretty scary to suddenly walk in and they're taking like 10 vials of blood and whatever and you're suddenly looking at things that you've never looked at before. So the wonder of, is there something wrong here, you know? But like she covers the bases. Hey Molly. - Hi. - How's a going? - Good to see you. - Yeah, good to see you. - So I got your test results. I was just reviewing your questionnaires. - Okay, great. - And we have plenty to talk about today. - Perfect. - What are you most concerned about? - I'm most concerned of burning out. I fly 40, 50 times a year. I change timezones all the time, sometimes multiple times in a week. My insomnia's bad, I've been trying everything, you know? Different kinds of things like fasting, I've been trying nootropics. - Yeah. Nootropics are interesting. The problem with some nootropics is that we don't always know exactly where they're made. A lot of these companies are online companies that are ordering research chemicals off the internet. So they are ordering and sourcing their own chemicals from the dark web. So the problem is that you really want to find a super high quality source. When you take nootropics, always ask the person you're getting them from, even the websites, where do they make them? When do they expire? What are the risks, what are the benefits? What are the things I should be concerned about? I think that nootropics are great but I also think that a lot of people don't have the basics down. They're not doing the things that they need to do, like the sleep, the nutrition, the exercise, the stress management and they're trying to take a shortcut. Unfortunately the shortcuts, they don't always work as well as the basics. So you have to have both. You've got a couple markers of oxidative stress and inflammation. Your CRP is 2.1, I'd like to see it at 0.5. Your homocysteine is 11 and I'd like to see it at five to seven. So we need to cut these in half at least. You have a history of smoking, right? - Yeah, yeah, that ended a couple years ago. - Right. - But like casual smoking, I still don't have an excuse for. - Well that's the thing, that's still smoking and the thing is that your body still has that toxic burden that you had from quitting two years ago. You also have elevated liver enzymes. So that's also possible that with this constellation, it just tells me that your body, your liver's working overtime right now. Getting the right kind of exercise for you is gonna be key. You wanna make sure you get a decent amount of yoga in because as we get older, we become less flexible. Weightlifting is important for muscle growth and muscle density and cardiovascular exercise for our heart. And then I'd like to get you to eat at least two servings of vegetables per meal. If you could do that, that's gonna be probably like six to eight servings of fruits and vegetables of day. But for you to just bump those up, that's gonna help with the detoxification. Because it's gonna, the fiber is just gonna be super helpful for your gut function. So there is one other biohack that I just realized I should probably recommend to you. I just experienced this new type of therapy called, actually it's not new, it's really old. It's called hyperbaric oxygen therapy, have you heard of it? - Yes, I have absolutely. - Okay. So it's pretty old technology, right? But it's being used in a new way. So it's traditionally been used for things like wound healing and cancer and neurodegenerative diseases and traumatic brain injury, but it turns out that doctors are now using it to optimize health and human performance. - Molly pointed me towards this clinic where you can go in and you can actually sit in a hyperbaric chamber for an hour and it helps you really oxygenize the blood and it's really old technology that was used to help divers with the bends and now it's being repurposed for a modern, busy lifestyle, especially for those that fly a lot like me. - The air we're breathing now is only 21% oxygen. The air that we breathe in the chamber is 100% oxygen. They've actually done studies, when you're in a high oxygen environment and you're doing mental tasks, you can do them better, you can think better and think faster and even after you get out of the chamber, you actually can get increased oxygen to the brain and improve executive function. The ability to recall things from long term memory and to attention focus, just in five sessions and they did this in college students in China, for their crazy exams that they have to take or something. So these guys got a performance edge and so more people in the biohacking and especially the high performing and the high flying case like you are using hyperbaric therapy to just improve that cognitive boost. Looking good. - Okay, I think I feel pretty free and easy. Ready to do this. - Blood pressure's a little on the high side. Take some deep breaths, we've got a little more time. It's okay, this is okay for the chamber. You know what it is, it's all that hypoxia from being on the planes, to be honest, right? That's gonna constrict blood vessels and-- - Yeah. - Cause some bad things to get released over time. But there's mitigation strategies. That's why you're, I guess one of the reasons maybe why you're doing this, right? This is a grounding to prevent from static electricity. This is a flammable environment. That's why you got into nice scrubs, except otherwise as your momma gave you, right? - And the tattoos. - Well, that's true. You're a big guy, heavier push. So you combine increased atmospheric pressure with increased oxygen and it's the combination that drives 1200%, potentially more oxygen into circulation. So remember, if you need to clear your ears, just open up your mouth nice and wide, swallow. You can take a drink of water, move your neck side to side. You can hold your nose and blow your ears. If you have any trouble at all, just let me know, all right? You are good. All right, I'll be here. Oxygen we need for life. If we don't have oxygen, we die. Oxygen creates energy in our body. What hyperbaric therapy is doing is stimulating the energy system to work more optimally. We can regenerate blood vessels in your brain. We can make your hippocampus, the area that you store long term memories work better. We can help your heart function better and pump more oxygen more efficiently and these things can last. Now it may be that you have to come in periodically for a couple boosts here and there but your body gets more primed to hyperbaric oxygen therapy over the long term after you've got the full protocol. That amount of oxygen actually just is a huge catalyst for change, a huge catalyst for optimizing your physiology. Nik, this is the future. (chuckling) (relaxed electronic music) - At nearly $400 a pop, I don't think I'll be using the hyperbaric oxygen chamber that much. I'm getting tired of all the gadgets. I actually preferred Molly's less expensive, more balanced approach. When I was back home for a couple of weeks, I had time to try out this new health regime. I started eating healthier and even started cooking for myself. - Good, nice, good, hit the floor and pop, come on, man. - I work out twice a week with my trainer. - Tight, tight, yes, little bit better, last one. - But it's really hard to fit in with my travel, let me tell you. - Push last one, that's right. (grunting) - I was taking supplements as per Molly's suggestion as well as adding some that Eric recommended. One for my liver detoxification, a myriad of vitamins, some magnesium, trying to boost my immune system and increase my energy. I also hooked up with nootropics when I needed to double down on work and when the schedule was getting tight. Hi, hi, hi, how are you? - I'm good, thank you. We're still on for next week. - But to be honest about it, this extra health regime was just adding to my work and my stress levels were just not reducing. In fact, I was getting more stressed trying to track my health on top of the busy work schedule and I had exhausted all the biohacking options out there. I mean no doubt I was getting more physically fit, but I was still pretty worn out. I called Dr. Molly for some advice and she recommended that I take a break. I talked to a life coach down in San Francisco, very West Coast indeed. I'll tell you what's going on. - When you come to these types of situations when you've tried everything, it often helps to take a step back and slow down and think about, or just not think and have a practice of just being you and it might be hard to know what that is at first. Tell me if there was a time when you haven't experienced this kind of state of burnout or this feeling that you're getting close to burnout. Do you remember a time? - Yeah, I mean it's pretty tough. It was quite a long time ago. There were a couple of periods in my life where I just quit work just to write music for six months or a year. - So there you go. - So I-- - Music? - Yeah, maybe I got back to that. But I don't want to stop, right? Just being a workaholic and working so hard, I'm trying to avoid the situation I had when I was growing up, which I didn't have any money and people around me would say "You don't have anything." And I just work really hard to ensure that I have more than I need, an abundance of income, an abundance of clients and fulfilling work as well, right? So that's really interesting to see that my workaholic sort of tendencies has been rooted in something more foundationally psychological. - Getting vulnerable. - Yeah. Getting vulnerable with you, yeah, it feels very emotional when I talk about tapping into that, you work so hard because, you know, it is, it's a direct visceral reaction to, you know, not having money when I was at university, not having money when I was growing up. Never having the abundance that I saw people around me having, they were getting bought new things-- - Did anyone make fun of you for it? - All the time. When I graduated, even though things started to get better, I'd close the doors around me because I had to protect my work situation, my relationship situation. - You didn't want anyone else to know that you were poor and that you were struggling. - Yeah, like-- - And you didn't want your family to know. - Yeah, well it was just tough times. It's not, I could afford to eat, I had clothes on my back. Families are good at keeping that going. So it wasn't being destitute but like in my heart, I was more lonely than ever before and I felt lonely. So I was like isolating myself away from everything and the only way out of the hole was working and working-- - Yeah. - And working harder than anyone else and it just felt normal and now it doesn't feel normal at all. It feels destructive to my life. - There's a few things that I would recommend. One is one a weekly basis, just think about having three hours for yourself and that's sacred. There's no meetings, you can't schedule anything else and just slow down. We are like going faster and faster and using these nootropics or supplements and psychedelics for example to accelerate and to improve and optimize. It seems mutually exclusive or at odds when we think about going back to the basics and reconnecting with ourselves. (relaxed electronic music) - For the last eight months, I've been chasing my own tail. Taking nootropics to do more work but I've never really stopped to question why I'm working so hard. Maybe I need to stop more often and listen to my body instead of trying to bulldoze my way through. (soft guitar, piano music) So I've been traveling around North America and I've been getting involved in a scene called biohacking. I've met people that have encouraged me to get involved with everything from nootropics and smart drugs, sitting in hyperbaric chambers, putting cranial stimulation devices on my head to try and optimize who I am. More focus, more attention, more ability. And through all this experimentation, it's made me realize something. We're not limitless as humans, nor should we be and if we come back and focus in on who we are, that means that we can put into focus what we need to do with our culture and how that's changing with technology. We used to work with our hands building things and then we're in the knowledge economy right now, we're working with our heads. Going forward, we're gonna work with our hearts. That's how the world is gonna change and that's the wisdom that we need to take us into the future. (applauding) We're headed into a brave new world. People expect us to do more and to be more and to achieve more. But we can't lose sight of who we really are. We're humans, we're mothers and fathers, we're family members and that's what's really important in life. (relaxed electronic music) (relaxed electronic music)
