Ok, then, show us around! What's there? Basement. You two go there... And, what do you have here? A well. -Petrov! -I didn't have time to finish it. It's dark, I can't see anything. There is... hay. Fuck! Comrade Colonel, look what we've found. Did these fuckers take everything? I took the guys to my place last night. -Why? -Because of that. How are they? One of them is leaking pus... We need to move them. They may come check my place, too. Russia for centuries has played a very positive, stabilizing role.... -Do you want some more? -No, thank you. And it will be like this in the future. no one even doubt it ! We perfectly understand what kind of world we live in... We'll strive for a peaceful resolution of all conflict situations... Despite numerous vocations from the international community the agreement is not yet fulfilled by Russia. Russian troops remain in Gori, territory of Upper Abkhazeti is occupied as well. About 220 peaceful civilians are dead... but the number of soldiers killed during the armed conflict is not yet known... The Russian president signed the Ceasefire Act on August 12th, although Russia still violates the terms of the agreement. The bombardment of the Georgian territory and the arrogance of Russian soldiers is still ongoing... Concurrently Russian occupants have deployed 50 units in Zugdidi from Gali. The military still remains in Gori.... I'll go and bring some dressings and medicines. Should we burn them out? Soldier, are you fucking dickhead? Just fuck off from here! Honey, Come here, my dear. Ah! Mummy's earring! Daddy! Aunt Khatia, look, what Daddy has brought! Mummy's earring... I thought I lost it. What we've got here? A villager. Don't touch him! Tamo, they're just interested if he is a soldier or not. They'll just check his shoulder. I'll do it myself. Uncover his shoulder. Maybe he is left-handed? Another one. You can pass! Come here. Aunt Khatia, the priests have come to the village to take the dead. Did you see them? Father. -What's the matter? -I have a letter for you. You just go home, ok? -Does it ache? -No. Why didn't Vazha leave? Where would he go after that car accident? He couldn't get Tamo away from that broken down car. Lia was so beautiful, right? Tamo kind of looks like her. If I wasn't fasting I know what I would do with you... -Ready? -Yeah. Glory to God! Glory to God! Glory to God! Amen! Amen! Amen! Try the beans. Let's make a toast to this family. May you always have the mercy of God and what's most important, let there always be peace! I'll translate for you too: Let this family always have good luck, to be protected by God and peace to reign in our region, but there is no peace without you. Georgians always knew how to cook? It's in their culture. To the Georgian people. Just eat some, you'll like it. Let's invite them to the table too, or it's very inconvenient. Call them. Come here, please.

We came here to protect you. Why the fuck do you need the West? We have so much in common, we are brothers. We have the same belief. Isn't it true, Father? Tell me, would you let your youngest son go into the forest at night alone? No, you wouldn't. The wolves will eat him. And we will not let you go, because we love you, we love you till death! We won't let you go.
