[tense music] [chains rattling] [Kelly panting] - Hey guys, it's Kelly. Hey guys, it's Kelly. Hey guys, it's Kelly. Hey guys, it's Kelly. Hey guys, it's Kelly. Hey guys, it's Kelly. [chattering continues] [tense music continues] Help! Someone get me out of here! Help! Stop! Stop, stop! Help! Help! Someone get me out of here! Help! Help! Stop! - You must be Kelly. - No, no. Help! Help, someone get me out of here, please help. - You must be Kelly. - What do you want? [Charles laughs] - You must be Kelly. You must be Kelly. - What do you want, you freak? - You must be Kelly. You must be Kelly. - Listen to me, you fucking asshole- - You must be Kelly! - You must- - Yes, yes! Yes. Yeah. I'm Kelly. - Kelly. Nice to meet you. It's a pleasure to meet you, I'm Charles. - Pleased to meet you too, Charles. Pleased to meet you too. - Do you know what that was? - No, I don't. - We were being polite to each other. It's a courtesy, Kelly. We made one positive presumptive notion that it was nice to meet each other even when we don't know each other. Do you know what somebody my age has to do to get some undivided attention from you? I got to tie you up. I got to kidnap you. That's how I make you focus. - What do you want? - I want to release you from this prison. - I politely request you to tell me what it is you want from me. - All right, I'll cut to the chase; you're an influencer, right? - Yeah, I guess. - You guess? You guess? You have 467,493, followers right now. You're an influencer or not? - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. And I would like you to think of me as a de-influencer. - That's why you're wearing a mask? - That's for your protection. - That ugly, huh? - Start listening! Start listening like your life depends on it, Kelly, cause it does! - You're going to kill me anyways. - Am I? - Yeah. - Really? - Yeah. - And how do you know that? - Because no one would go that far just to release them after. - Oh, I didn't say you wouldn't have to earn your freedom, Kelly, you do. But your freedom is possible. Unharmed, I promise. - How? - Well, just be yourself. - I am myself. - No, the real you. This you. - What? - Who's that? - It's me. - Don't be stupid, Kelly, who's that? Who is it? - It's me. - No, but it's it's not, is it? Look at it. It's a more airbrushed, filtered, like romantic soft version of you. It's not the real you. You that manipulates little girls into thinking that they need to look this beautiful on the outside with nothing on the inside. I wish those little girls could see you now. Not so soft. Look at that hard look in your eyes. Looking at that weapon on the floor, wondering if you could get to that pipe, maybe beat me to death with it. Maybe escape out of here. You think those lies, about how soft you are, are better than the cold hard truth? They're not. It's not soft. So why do you project that lie when the truth is much more interesting? - Pretty please with a fucking cherry on top. What the fuck do you want? - Kelly, I just want to collaborate with you. [dramatic music] [driving tense music] [buzzer beeping] [light clicks] [buzzer beeping] [Kelly banging] - Help! Please, I'm in here! [door banging] Fuck! Help! Shit. [tense music] Please! Please! Shit. - Do not attempt to escape, Kelly; if you do expect nothing less than a bullet in your head. [pipe clatters] [eerie music] [camera clicks] [camera clicks] You're wasting precious time, Kelly. - Take the fucking picture. - No, Kelly. We're not looking for a proof of life. This isn't some ransom request. - What? - Take one of your normal photos. Something worth 1,000 likes. Come on, play the game. - No. No, no. I've just been kidnapped, I'm not going to post just a casual selfie. - What are you so worried about? The number of followers you have has jumped by thousands. It's going to make taking this kind of photo easier and easier. - You're messing with people's mind. Acting all normal. Who does that? - Messing with people's minds, isn't that what you do on social media all day long? - This is messed up. - Play the game. Something worth 1,000 likes. - You know what? Fuck this shit. - This is disappointing. Now I'm going to have to escalate things. [gas hissing] - No! [Kelly coughing] Hey, what the fuck did you do? Answer me, what did you do? - A lesson. I taught you a lesson. - What? - I need you to engage with your task. - My task? - 1,000 likes in an hour. Christ, Kelly, you have half a million followers, have you any idea how easy a thousand likes from that would be? But what did you do? Hey, what did you do? Nothing. - So what? - So I took a toe. - You did what? - You can live a perfectly normal life with nine toes. I'm sure lots of people do it. - What did you do that? What do you need? Do you need followers? What do you need? - Not followers; listen, Kelly, likes. I need likes from your account. This is your audience. I need you to show me that you can get a message out there and they will react to it. - Look, I get it, as you may be all new to this, granddad, but I shouldn't be judged on how many likes, I should be judged on how many followers I get. This is what you need from me, right? - Not followers, you're not listening, Kelly. Likes. And I don't need them, you need them. These are likes from your account. We're going to post from your account. This is your audience, you should be cherishing them. They're the most important thing in the world to you. - I don't give a shit about followers. My followers are the most important thing in the world to me. My followers are the most important thing in the world to me. All right, stop! Jesus Christ. - Do you understand me now? - I understand that you're fucking sick in the head and now you're got to fucking kill me, so fuck off! - Easy, easy. You're straining yourself. You're going to rip the stitches in your foot. - Good. Then hopefully I'll bleed out. - You can't escape this. - You're a liar. - I will never lie to you. Ever. - You're going to kill me. What you're doing right now is just you playing with your food, having fun, that's what you're doing. - That's not true. - How's that? - Because I'm still wearing my mask. - That's just cause you're fucking ugly. [Kelly whimpers] - Stop, okay? Stop. Stop, Kelly. Your little bitchy words, they have real life consequences here. You're not bitching at some little teen behind the safety of a keyboard. No, here your words mean something. Here, my words mean something. And today what I'm telling you is I'm keeping this mask on because I believe you can get out of here. And the reason I'm doing it is because you won't ID me later. - ID you? - To the authorities for Christ's sake, Kelly. Aren't you going to make a 9-1-1 call and talk about the man that held you captive? And when you do that, I need to give you as little information as possible. You already know my voice. You already know my name. - Look, I promise that if you let me out, I won't say anything. - I'm afraid that time has been and gone. In order to gain your freedom now you need to do the tasks I set you. If you hit the goal, I'll let you go. It's that simple. - So what? You're just going to keep playing with me till you get enough likes, is that what you're going to do? - These are your likes. We're posting from your account. It's your followers, therefore, you. - No! - Yes. Yes you will. And if you don't, Kelly, I will take you piece at a time until there's nothing left. - Oh yeah? Then do so. I'm not begging for my life, I have more pride than that. - I can see that. Kelly isn't going to beg for her life. Maybe you'll beg for someone else's. Maybe you'll beg for hers. - What? - You'll see. - Wait, no. No. Come back here! Hey! Oh my god. - Don't! Hey! - Hey! It's okay, it's okay, I'm not him. - I was running, there was a van. - I'm not the guy that took you, he took me too. - Who? - I don't know. - Where are we? - I'm not sure. I don't know. - Who are you? - I'm Kelly. - Weaver? - Yeah. How do you know? - Your picture, it's all over the news, you're missing. - Okay, see? They're looking for us. We're going to be okay. - What does he want? - I'm not sure. Do you remember anything? How did you get there? How far you traveled? Anything? - Nothing, just this voice. - What did he say? - That I was here to help you get you out of your prison. What does that mean? - Wait, wait, it's going to be okay. - What happened? - Nothing, nothing. - Did he do that? - No. - Why lie, Kelly? - Is that him? - Yeah. - Why lie about what? - That bandage you see, Sabrina, I took a toe because she didn't do as I asked. She's lucky that's all I took. Who knows what I'm going to take next? Maybe a finger. Might be something more important to her. Something on that pretty face of hers. An ear, an eye, my, I have so much to choose from. I really do have my work cut out for me. - Oh my god, oh my god. We're going to die. - No. - We're those girls. - No, no! - He's going to rape and kill us. - We're not going to die, no one is getting raped, okay? - I want to go home. He's going to kill us. I can't die. - My favorite girls in the world! Oh my god, I want to live forever! What is that? - [Charles] Well, that's you, Sabrina. - Make it stop! - Telling everybody that you want to live forever. - Why is he doing this? - He's trying to get into your head. - Well, it's working. - All right, all right. I'll do what you want. [buzzer beeping] [camera clicking] - Kelly. Kelly, there's a phone. - Caption for the photo. - What? - [Charles] Caption for the photo. - I'm lonely. Anyone wants to talk to me? - Is there anything else? - Post it. - [Charles] It's live. - What now? - We wait. - For what? - For people to like it. [timer beeping] [melancholy piano music] I can't watch this. - You're a cheerleader, aren't you? - Yeah. For the Devils. - That's cool. - I guess. What about you? - No. Not slutty enough. I dunno know, something about it feels wrong. I mean, it's only for boys, right? Well, I guess you wouldn't think that, otherwise you wouldn't be doing it. Sorry. Don't know why I said that. - No. It's fine. You're right, honestly. - Then why do it? - My boyfriend is the quarterback. - So you really are that girl. - Yep. Very popular. For all the good it does to me. - What happens if it doesn't hit 1,000? - I don't know. [timer beeping] [tense music] [descending ringing] - [Charles] And you're out of time. Show's over. - What's happening? - No, no, no, no, no! Please! No, no, no, please, please. I swear to god, I tried my best, just needed more time. Please, please! [Kelly screaming] - Are you okay? Sabrina, what happened? - He made me watch. - Made you watch what? - I'm sorry, I tried to get you, I couldn't move. - Sabrina, what are you talking about? Sabrina, what happened? - I'm so sorry. I did everything I could. - I took one of your kidneys. - You did what? - This was difficult for me. You didn't hit the target, but god, you tried. And it was a valiant effort. I mean, look at this picture. 999 likes. If I was on social media, I would've liked this picture. But I'm not, so you missed it. And the target is a target. And missing it has a cost, Kelly. - You took my fucking kidney. - Just the one. You still have the other one. - I'm sorry. - Hey, don't be. This wasn't your fight. But the next one might be. Do you know what this reminds me of? Theseus. Any of you ladies heard the story? - No idea what you're talking about. - In ancient Greece, there was a man called Theseus who had a ship, and over a course of time his ship would need repairs; the wood would rot, so we'd have to replace it plank by plank. So eventually, seven years later, the entire ship had been replaced. - Okay, so? - Well, so if the entire ship has been replaced from its original raw materials, is it still the same ship? - Yeah, I guess. - I agree with you. But not everybody does. Interesting though, isn't it? - Does this have a point? - Kelly, I'm glad you asked. There is. Because what's happening to you here and now is changing you. You lose a toe, it changes you. You lose a kidney, it changes you. Forever. But maybe it's a piece of you that needed replacing. Maybe you needed to change in order to grow, in order to see the world a different way. Maybe you're not the same person you were a week ago. And maybe that's a good thing. [alarm beeping] I'll leave you with that thought. And good luck. You're going to need it. - Kelly. - Let me think. - Don't. Don't. I'm a med student. I saw what he did to you, there was a lot of blood. If you put pressure on it, it should clot it, but you cannot remove that bandage. - Okay. Okay. - 5,000. That's too many. - No, no, I can do it. - How? - Sex. Sex sells. [tense driving music] [camera clicks] Fuck. I can do better than that. - [Charles] Are you ready to post? - No, take another one. Take the fucking picture. [water pouring] [camera clicks] - Okay, I need to say something sexy. - [Charles] Are you ready to post? - Yeah, hold on. - [Charles] What is the caption? - I love the rain. - No. No, that's not. Nothing better in this world than a hot, wet cheerleader. - That's good. - Boys are stupid, right? - You heard her. Post it. - I'm afraid I didn't hear what Sabrina said. What was the caption? - Nothing better in this world than a hot, wet cheerleader. - [Charles] It's live. - Boys are stupid. It'll work. - Yeah, but will it work in two hours? Is that what I think it is? - A watch? - A smart watch? - Yeah, there's not exactly wifi in here. - Okay, but he has our phone. I saw it. He has mine. - Okay, and? - Well, so when he comes in, the Bluetooth can turn in and the messages that have been pending can send out. We can get the word out. - And say what? - That we've been kidnapped. - Well, they probably already know we're missing and we don't know where we are. - It's worth a try. - Okay. - Be careful, he's watching. - I figure he's always watching. - No. No. I haven't seen anyone else. - So? - And he has to sleep sometimes. - What should I tell them? - That we're alive, but trapped in something that looked like an abandoned boiler room, and there's one guy with an English accent. That's all we know. - Okay. I'll send a voice message to one of my friends. - Why not the police? - Well, you can't exactly text 9-1-1 and we don't even know where we are. - Okay, but they can locate our phones. - Yeah, but what if he finds out? He'll move us or worse. - Yeah, you're right. - Do you have something to share with the class, ladies? There's a lot of whispering down there. - Yeah. We need tampons. You hear me? - [Charles] It will be arranged. - Tampons? - You ever see a guy who wants to know more about periods? - Boys are stupid. - Boys are stupid. [timer ticking] [tense music] [bright jingling] [Charles clapping] - Wonderful. You see, it is possible for you, Kelly, to hit a target. All you needed was the right motivation. - Yeah. Piece of cake. Give us something harder next time. [Charles chuckles] You got our supplies? - Of course. Apologies. I believe I told you what I wanted, Kelly. Well done. Good night. - I got your likes. Let us go. - No, you two are in this together now. But I will make you a deal: if you hit the next target, Kelly, I'll let one of you go. I'll let you guys pick who. But for now, how about we get your friend out of her chains? Not her handcuffs. And eight hours sleep and maybe some food and water. That sound good? Good night, ladies. - Hey, question. Where the fuck are we supposed to go to the bathroom? Are you fucking kidding me? And you got to record us, you fucking twisted asshole? - I'm sorry it's not the Four Seasons, Kelly. But you may think me a psychopath, that's the only area of this room my cameras cannot see. So I assure you, your dignity will remain intact. You won't be violated like that. Goodnight, ladies. - I'm going to record more messages. - No. We should wait to see what's going to come back first. - But we can't send anything until he is in the room. We need to prerecord something. - We don't have anything new though. - It's not just that. - What? - My battery. - On your watch? - No, the watch is fine for now. It's on my phone. - Oh. Does he have your passcode? - No. - Then you'll be good. If you don't use a phone, it won't drain. - That's true I hope. - What's wrong? - I'm going to record something for my family just in case. - You don't have to do that, because we will beat this fucker, okay? - You should probably do the same thing. - No. No. I won't. And you know why? - Cause we're going to beat this fucker. - Exactly. I found a spot near the bathroom to hide the watch, just in case anything happens to me. - Okay. - Keep your messages short, it'll send faster. Hey, mom, hey, dad. Just want to send this message and tell you I love you. [buzzer beeping] How many? - Let me think. - How many? - [Kelly] Hold on. - Kelly! - 10,000. - 10,000?! Are you fucking kidding me? - It's okay, we can do this. - In how long? - Two hours. - Two hours? That's not enough time. - I've done it before, we can do it. - It's not enough fucking time. - Help me. - Well, strip tease. - Come on. - You're wearing half of nothing already, what fucking difference does it make? Post a bunch of photos. - Okay, yeah. Strip tease. Different post. I'll spread them out. - What? - I'll post every three minutes then hopefully it'll fill out this timeline. - Well, is that going to work? - It's worth a try. Start thinking of captions. - Kelly. - What? - We're smart girls, right? - Yeah. It's the boys that are stupid. - It's not that it's just, we're jumping through hoops. We're playing a game of cat and mouse and you know the only way to get out of that. - How? - Stop being the mouse. - I have to play his game. - Why? - Because next time he will be more than a fucking toe he will take from me. - Or a kidney. - Yeah. I'm trying not to think about that. But if we win, he will let you go. - He said either one of us. - That's a fight we will have later. Okay? When we win. - You really think we can win? - I want a series of pictures. - [Charles] Standing by on your command, Kelly. - Go. [camera clicks] [camera clicks] [camera clicks] Spread these out. - [Charles] Over how long? - Three minutes. - Caption for the first image? - Whoever gets me to 10,000 gets a spicy surprise. - [Charles] Well, that's inspiring, miss Weaver. - Post it. - [Charles] Is there anything else? - No. Yes, yes, hashtags. Hashtag hot, hashtag cheerleader, hashtag escort, hashtag call girl, hashtag, just post it. [counter beeping] [tense music] We're not going to make it in time. - Shit. - Wait. Wait, I have an idea. We're going to record one more message. - Saying what? - That whoever can, to find me on social. - Okay, then what? - Then buy us followers. Buy us followers to get us across the line. - I can't send a message unless he's in the room. - I'll get him in here. Just get your messages ready. - Okay. - Hey, dickhead. I need something. - Miss Weaver, do you remember where rudeness gets you? - Yeah, sorry. I need props. - We've completed the posting. - No. You never told me how many posts I was allowed to do. - What is it you require. - Whipped cream. - [Charles] I see. Sadly, I don't have any on hand. - Well, I need it to get across the line. - Very well. I'll need 10 minutes. - Then put 10 minutes back on the clock then. - No. No, you have a time limit. - Then hurry the fuck up! Fuck. [timer beeping] [tense music] - I don't think we're going to make it. - We're going to make it. Trust me. - He's coming. - The supplies you requested. - Only one can? - Don't play with me, little girl. You'll get burned. - Hey. - You've been told my name. - Charlie. - Excuse me? - Charles, sorry. Charles. - Yes, miss Weaver? - What am I allowed to post? - Anything at all. - Anything? - No. Not that. I'm afraid I don't control social media censorship. - Censorship? - I'm sure you know, miss Weaver, nobody can post any nudity on social media. It would be reported and flagged and removed for inappropriate content. I'm sure you know that. - And if I had whipped cream? - Then I'm sure you're fine - Funny world, huh? - Indeed. Social media just masquerading at having a conscience, whilst all the time trying to sexualize everything. Good luck. - I want that extra 10 minutes. - You really think it's going to help you? - I do. - Fine. Extra 10 minutes. - Did it go through? - Yes. - Oh my god. Okay. - You got a voice note reply. - I want to see. - He'll see. - No, no, I'll be careful, trust me. - Hello, Sabrina and Kelly, this is Detective Langley. We received your messages and understand the situation. If you could help us out by describing your environment; what the walls are made out of, what the floor is like, if there's any traffic noises from outside, anything that you can tell us that might help us lead us to you. We have many people searching right now. I know your posts are forced and you're not really safe. I appreciate the need for discretion with your messages. Let's communicate short and frequent. We will find you. I promise. - Hello. It's Kelly Weaver. We're in some, industrial building out of the city. There's some big, large, narrow windows. I can't see really through them. The wall is made from red brick. One more thing. The guy is British. He's telling me his name is Charles, but it's probably bullshit. Actually, I don't know, cause he's crazy. He has been setting me some social media challenges. Just me, not Sabrina, and he's saying that if I don't do them, he will kill. Just find us, okay? - Kelly. [timer beeping] [tense music] - Hope they got the message. [tense music continues] - Come on. This is it. Come on. Come on. [bright chiming] - Whoa. Holy shit. - No. Fuck, they need to stop. Shit. - It's too many. - It's too many, he's going to know something's up. - I did it. - Is that a victory statement or some admission of guilt? - What? - "I did it." - Yeah. - Yeah what? - I completed your task. - No you didn't, you cheated. Cause the last thousand likes that you got are from bots. - What do you want me to tell you? Probably some guy was trying to see my tits and get me to 10,000. I don't know. - No! You cheated. The only question is how. - I didn't. - Kelly, do you remember I don't like lies? - You never said that. - Really? - You know what you said though? You said that you would never lie to me. You said that if we hit the target, you'd let one of us go. So let her go. - [Sabrina] No! - Prove to me you're not a liar and release her. - No. - Yes, release her. - No. - Wow. Now this is getting interesting, huh? So you cheat at my game, but you're starting to act like a human being, Kelly to release your friend rather than yourself? What's that feel like? - You're a liar if you don't let her go. - Tell me how you cheated. - I didn't. - If you tell me how I'll spare your life. - For what? To play another one of your fucking games tomorrow? No, fuck that. Release her! - All right. - No. Wait. - Five, four, three, two. - Stop! I did it. It was me. - No she didn't. - Yes, I did it! I cheated! - She didn't, it was me. Yes I did, I cheated. - You did? - Yes. - No she didn't. - Yes I did! I didn't want you to know about it. I reprogrammed the phone. I bought us followers, I know my dad's credit card. - You. You've got this sort of skill set? - No, no. - Yes. Yes, yes, I didn't. Yes I did. It's the truth. - No she didn't. - Yes, yes I did. But she would've done it anyways, she was almost there, it was just a backup plan. - So you did this? - Yes. - Alone? - Yes. - Kelly, I didn't want you to know anything about it. I did it all by myself, I promise. I promise, I'm telling the truth. - Show me. So do it again. Show me. - [Sabrina stammering] Don't tell me about it, show me! Do it again! Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again! Do it again. You can't, can you? You can't do it because you never did it in the first place. You're lying. That's the first thing I know. And if you didn't then she did. Right? And let me tell you the last thing I know. Nobody here's on their period. The box is full. - There's been a lot going on. - Let me tell you what's going on here, Sabrina, Kelly isn't taking this game very seriously. This game that's playing with your life, but we can correct that. [gun slicks] - No! No! [Sabrina screaming] No. I'll play your game, I swear. No, I'll play your game, I swear. No, I'll play your game, I swear. No. [gun bangs] [blood splatters] It's Kelly. Sabrina has been murdered. He shot her. He shot her because I cheated. He fucking killed her. He wants me to learn a lesson about all this, but what lesson? I tried to protect her and she died trying to protect me. You killed her. - [Charles] No, you did. The minute you decided not to play fair. But it's okay. We'll play again tomorrow. Would you like that? - No. - You can still make it out, Kelly. - I know. Cause you're still wearing a mask. - That's right. - But I'm not going to. - You're not going to make it out? - No. I'm not going to play your game. Just kill me already. - But why, Kelly? I don't intend on killing you. - But you did with Sabrina. - Sabrina was part of my plan. - What was she? - She was collateral damage. - And what am I? - Oh no, you're something much, much more special. I never intended to test any of Sabrina's capabilities like I do yours. I want to set you free. - Then let me out. [Charles chuckles] - Aren't you missing the bit where you promised not to tell the police about me? - We're passed that. Listen to me. If I ever get out of here, I'll be dedicating every fucking second of my life to help them track you and bring you to justice. - Is that right? - Yeah. But you won't let me out. I heard your voice. I know your name. I saw what you did to Sabrina. You can't let me out. - You know for somebody with such a smart mind, capable of the long game, it's amazing that you gravitated to a short term, instant gratification. - It's not a long game. It's a short one. And in 24 hours, I'll be dead. The choice is still yours. - But I don't want to play. - The ship is still yours, Theseus. Kelly, some pieces of wood are rotten, they need to be replaced, that's all. - So what? You're going to cut another defenseless girl or murder another woman? Is that what you're going to do? - What happened with Sabrina was a tragedy and it's changed you, maybe forever. But maybe, just maybe it's a piece of you that needed to change. Otherwise, how will you ever see something new? So play my game. - I'm not going to play your fucking game. - All right. Kelly won't play my game. So I will stimulate you the only way I know how. You're going to play for someone else. - No, no, don't. - You give me no choice. - No, please don't do that. Please. - Hey. Hey! What's going on? - What the fuck? - Hey, what's going on? - No, no, no, no. Shut up. Get her out of here, please! Okay, I'll play your game, but for myself, not for her. - Who are you talking to? - Shut up. - Did you put me here? - Shit. - Talk to me. You've got the wrong girl, my name is Jill and I didn't- - Shut up. I don't want to know anything about you, is that clear? - Okay. - You hear me? Get her out of here. I'll play your game, I swear. - Got it. [buzzer beeping] What? What is that? - Did someone sign me up for one of those extreme escape room experiences? - What? - Shouldn't I have been given a safe word or something? Turkey baster or- - This isn't that. - You mean, this is real? - Yeah. Yeah, this is real. - Don't leave. - I can't. Neither can you. - Should at least try something. - [Langley] Kelly, we got your message. We are going to get you out of there. Tonight, we'll try to pin your location down. We'll be launching single fireworks across various locations that match your description. When you hear it, note the exact time and send us a message. If you hear more than one, try to note each time and which sounded closer. One other thing; if you can get him to go out and buy something unique, something not so common, we can track purchases if we know what it was and what time roughly it was bought. Sit tight, Kelly, we are getting closer. - Hi, detective. Sabrina has been murdered. He got another girl in, I don't know her name yet. Yesterday I got him out of the building, I made him buy whipped cream around 9:00, 10:00 PM, I don't remember. And okay, I will listen to the fireworks. Thank you so much. - Hey! Are you okay? - Kelly, I've decided that this will be a two player game. Good luck, ladies. - Who are you? What are you bringing to the table? - Okay. I'm Jill. - I don't care about your name, what can you do? - I'm funny. Like pranks, bit of stand up, sometimes skits. - Not sure funny is going to help. - Yeah, maybe not. What works? - Sex. Sex sells 100% of the time. - I mean, not really in the mood right now, but we've got handcuffs. - You're funny. - Yeah, that was definitely a joke. - Focus. - Okay. Don't cheerleaders just post sexy pictures and tease the boys? - No, I feel this is all I've been doing. - I mean, I'm sure it's more than just that. All the boys are going to love it. - Not my boyfriend. - Right. I'm sure that's drama. - What? - I'm sure it causes a lot of relationship drama. - Yeah, it does. - Not sure that'll make for a good post. - No, no, wait. Yeah. It will. People love drama, right? - Yeah. They do? - Yeah. I need a video for this one. Can you do that? - As you wish. - Take it off. You need to follow my leave here, okay? Okay, put your hands on me. Start recording. - [Charles] Recording. - Hi, Ryan. I just wanted to tell you, it's over. I break up with you. We're done. You see her? That's Jill. She's my new squeeze, my new girlfriend. When I send her a picture in my underwear, she's there in five minutes. She picks up my call, she's there for me and let me tell you, she rocked my world in the bedroom more than you ever did. Oh, say hi to your dog for me. Cut. Give me tags. - Tags? - Hashtags. - Yeah, right. Cheating, hashtag dumped, over you, hashtag- - Hashtag sex, hashtag girl, hashtag lesbian, hashtag hot, hashtag cheerleader, hashtag horny, hashtag cosplay, hashtag daddy issues, hashtag hot, hashtag very hot. Is that good? - Yeah. I think you got it covered. - Post it. - [Charles] It's been posted. [timer beeping] - That performance back there came all too easy. - Please. You had the chance to make out with a hot cheerleader and for free. You'll probably get millions of new followers anyways. - I have a girlfriend. - Oh, shit, I'm sorry, I didn't know that. - Don't worry about it. We have bigger things on our mind. - Yeah, and you know what, maybe this will help us to reach the target and we can go home and everything will be fine. - Yeah, okay, I get it, but where's the limit? - I mean, we're not allowed to post anything too sexual. It just wouldn't post. - I know, want a shame. Cause if there's no limit, then you can just fuck me for views and then we can go around, find a homeless guy and hunt him down for sport. Go around town, finding every handicap kid and calling them a bunch of cunts. - Would you relax? - Would you just take a minute and be a human being? - For what? Do you think being a human being is going to save us? - Being whatever you are being isn't worth saving. - What? - Just would you try and be decent? - I am. - Oh really? - Yeah. - What's my name? - Um, it's, Jennifer. - Jill. - Close enough. - Will it work? - It should. Ryan has over 200,000 followers. We should be good. - I'd really like another take at that. I could have helped if I knew what was going on. - Relax. It's not our only hope. - What? - Sabrina. The girl that was there before you, she left a smart watch and I've been in communication with the police. They're trying to track us. - Smart. - Maybe. Maybe not. - Why say that? - Well, the Bluetooth connects every time he comes in on Sabrina's phone, which helped the messages to send. - So? - And so Sabrina is dead. Maybe he got rid of her phone or whatever, we don't know. - What exactly happened to Sabrina? - Let's not talk about that, okay? - Well, there's two of us and one of him. - He has a gun and he's fast and he's strong. - For one person. If one of us can get past him, we can get to the door when he comes through. - We don't know what's out there. - Better off than in here. - We could split his focus. - Okay. I'll attack him, you run for the door. - Okay, and what about you? - Get help once you're outside. - Maybe we're in the middle of nowhere. - Again, a chance I'm willing to take. - But he could kill you. - Haven't you been here long enough already? I know I have. I just, I want to go home. [firework pops] - What time is it? - What was that? - A single firework. - You sure? - Do you have the time? - No. - Okay, stay here. It's 11:15. I heard a firework. I'm keeping it short. Battery is low. We need to get him in here. - Why? - Because the message needs to send and it's very low. - Okay, how much time do we have? - Minutes. - Okay. Quit treating me like the enemy! - What are you doing? - You heard me, you bitch! I'm not going to let you walk all over me. If she's going to choose someone, it's going to be me. Sure as hell not going to be you. I've got so much to live for. You've got shit, girl! - Stop! Stop fighting! - Oh, fuck off. - Hey, fuck you! - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah? Make it really easy for him to choose who to set free. Kelly, watch out! [loud thud] - No. No, no. No, I'll play your game. No. No. I'll play your game. [Sabrina screaming] [blood splatters] [tense music] [buzzer beeping] - Five likes? - I thought I'd make this a little easier. You've had such a traumatic couple of days, and after all, it's quality, not quantity we're after. Right? - I don't get it. - The last video is going to be a live streamed one. You can say whatever you want. Think about what you want your legacy to be because at the end of that live stream, I'm going to kill you, Kelly. I promise I'll make it painless. And you've got 59 minutes to think about what it is you want to say. - Yeah, you know what? I think I'll pass. - You will perform. Your followers and me demand a show, so you are going to give us one. After all, it's your final one. - No. - [Charles] Kelly. - No! - [Charles] Saying no only forces me to find some other sacrificial lamb to put in there with you. - And what's the upside for me? - Well, you'll save a life. - Of someone I don't know? - And does that make that life less valuable? - No. But I think I'll focus on myself now. - Kelly, you can use this time, this platform, this huge audience you've amassed to say whatever it is you think is fitting as a final message for Kelly Weaver. It's live stream, so they won't be able to cut you off. And I promise you have your two minutes to say whatever it is you want. - Okay, fine. Fine, I'll do it. They want a performance, I'll give it to them. I just need a few things. - What do you need? Is it more whipped cream? - No. I just want food. - [Charles] A last supper. Fine. I'll have something for you in a few moments. - Take your time. There's no tomorrow for me. Fuck. No, no, no, no, no. Please. Fuck. Fuck! [tense music] [objects clattering] - Bring it on, bitch. [TV cracks] [TV shatters] [driving electronic music] [TV cracks] [driving electronic music continues] [distant thumping] [door creaks] [tense music] - [Charles] You shouldn't have done that, Kelly. Now we have to escalate things. [door creaking] [door slams] - You didn't have to kill her. - Which one? - Both of them. - You see, I felt they gave me little choice. - Why is that? - Well, one cheated and one attacked me, Kelly. - And don't you think killing them was a bit excessive, you fucking monster? - Wow. Now I've heard everything. A social media influencer calling me excessive? - Fuck you. If I ever get out of here, I will find you and make you pay for what you did. - Well, maybe, maybe you can make a web series out of it. - Yeah. - Some more content for your followers. - I'll go to prison every day just to take a picture of you to show them how fucking pathetic of a guy you are. Trust me. - Is that right? - Yeah. - Well, let me help you out. Well, you already know my name. - But let me help you a little more. Now you know what I look like. I hope this makes my intentions clear, Kelly. - You're uglier without the mask. - And you're a little raw without your filters. - Fuck you. - So that's it? You're just going to bust me up for your followers, that's the plan? - Yeah. - And that's the most important thing to you? Virtual vengeance for your masses? - Oh yeah, it is. And just for you, I'll make sure it goes viral too. - Then you haven't learned a goddamn thing. - I forgot that I needed to learn something. What is it called? Thesis ship? - Theseus. - What happened here, you really think it changed me? You really think that? - No, no. I don't think that at all. They didn't change you, you've been there all along, I just swept away a couple of things, discarded things. But that bitch inside that killer instinct, I just brought her out. But that was always there, Kelly. Just hidden away. You know, the funny thing about Theseus' ship, it isn't just about the bits that changed, the discarded things that happened to you. - Oh no? - No. It was about what if I could collect all the pieces that have been discarded, all the changes that had been made and make a whole new ship; a whole new Kelly. Imagine I could do that. Would you recognize each other? More importantly, Kelly, would you be afraid of each other? Would one Kelly fear what the other Kelly had become? - And whose fault is that? - Why, social media's. - Social media didn't kill Sabrina and suffocated Jill. - Oh my god, you are still defending social media. Haven't you learned anything? This is why you were rotten to your core. - I don't know. Is social media worse than a murder? Actually, no, don't answer. Keep that for court. Even if you kill me, they find you! - I hope so! I hope so, you fucking idiot! - You do? - Yeah! Your trial would be the trial of the century. - Oh. You're the one that wants to be famous now? - Fame? You think I want to be famous? You think that's why I'm doing all this? Don't you get it? Imagine it; I get put on trial for murdering you through social media. Some prosecutor is adept enough to prove that social media is dangerous in anybody's hands; my hands, your hands, but more importantly, children's hands. Look what it can do to them. Imagine they prove that. Imagine I'm guilty. Well, the ramifications are pretty exciting. Parents start to see what I've been seeing all along. This isn't right. These social media giants, they shouldn't be doing this. They're unchecked. They have no moral code. They're raising our young. They're the hand the rocks the cradle, Kelly! And we're letting them. They're giving one sided trial by social media stories. They're over sexualizing children before they've had their first kiss. Worse still, you know what they're doing? They're allowing cyber bullying so that some cunt like you can tell a six year old girl that she isn't pretty enough to be like her, because even if she's spent a million years editing all her photos, she will never be you. So don't message me again, bitch! Sorry, did I get all of that quote right? Was that what you said to her? And the next day she killed herself. Did you know that? - I don't know what you talking about? - No. Don't lie to me. I despise lies. Don't lie. - Everyone knows that social media is bullshit. Everyone knows that. - Not Children! Children don't know, Kelly. Children aren't suspicious. And I want to live in a world where they don't have to be. I just want them to be children. - Look, if I really did what you just said, which does sound like me, at least the old me, then just kill me, please. Just get it over with. - No. No, Kelly, because I need you for one last job. I need a star, Kelly, a star. Someone that can appeal to the masses cause no one gives a shit about a little six year old girl. But killer social media influencer, and the whole place is going to go nuts. So I need your star power. So tell me the only thing I want to know right now, one more question; are you ready for your closeup? Are you ready? - I'm not doing this, no. - Don't say it. - No. - Don't say it. - No, I'm not doing this. - Don't say it, don't say it, don't say it. Don't say it. Don't say it. - You can't take anything from me anymore. You took everything. - No, Kelly. No, Kelly. I'm the one with nothing to lose. I've got nothing left. I don't have the six year old anymore. So you don't want to be in a fight with me. You, you're young, you've got a family. You've plenty of chips on the table and you are forcing me to hurt them. - I'm not doing it. - Really, Kelly? I swore I was going to have to use this. Would you look at that? My, my. What a beautiful little girl. I bet she wants to be just like her big sister. You know, I heard she recently got her first social media account. What a milestone. - Don't fucking touch my sister, I swear to God. - Oh, I haven't yet. But I might. - If you touch one hair of her I will make sure to find you and fucking kill you. You don't touch her. - I bet she wants to be just like you. 400,000 friends, virtual of course, none that can actually help her. I wonder how easy it'll be to get to her. I know where you live. Her bedroom's second door on the left, right? - Promise me you won't touch her. - What's my promise worth? - Because you said you'd never lie to me. - And I never have. - Then promise me you won't touch her. - Are you going to play my game? Second door on the left. Upstairs is her bedroom. She's got a pink unicorn in there, hasn't she? - Okay, stop it. I'll do it. - You'll play my game? - I'll play your game. - Well, all right, then I promise you, she won't be touched. Are you going to mention me in the live stream? - Well, isn't that what you want? - No. No, this isn't about what I want and it won't affect the promise I just made to you for your sister; this is about what Kelly's going to do with the last two minutes of her life. You're lucky. How many people get to know that it's the last two minutes of their life, it just creeps up on them, but you will be dead in two minutes. Are you ready? - Okay. I know what I want to say. - It's just one minute. [sirens whirring] - Oh my god. Oh my god! Help me in here! Help me! I'm in here, please! Please! Please! Help me, help me, help me! [Charles laughing] - I'm sorry, that was cruel, but it was fun to watch. There's no one coming, Kelly. No police are anywhere near here. God, it's just a light gag. I can turn it off and on anytime I want. But there's no one coming. I set that up. It was a little bit of hope for you. But it's all just make believe. Look, watch. [sirens whirring] There we go. Hear the sirens? And watch them go away. Oh, you think they're looking for you, don't you? The firework, that was me. I've been Detective Langley this whole time with a voice changer, of course, but you're just talking to me. Oh no. I just took away the last bit of hope, didn't I? You were holding onto that thread that maybe some white knight in shining armor is going to come in and rescue you at the last minute. He's not. All that's left, Kelly, is a crushing defeat I'm afraid. You ready? Come on, let's get you out of these. There you go. There. You look great. We're going to be late. That's okay, I'm sure people waited for you. And here we go. In five, four, three. - A lot of you might think you know me. A lot of you might think that you know what my life is like, or about, but you don't. You don't know me. Actually, just a few does. My mom, my dad, my brother and my sister. You guys know. You're actually the only one that actually knows me. If I could go back in time, I would've never started social media. I mean, I wish I'd never have to say goodbye, but if I had to, I didn't want it to be on here. On social media. Cause it's the most entire social thing ever and such a waste of time. But to you, my family, I love you. And Lily, listen to me, baby, I don't want you to do this, okay? I want you to live a proper life. A real life. Not a virtual one. And to all my followers; you don't know me, okay? You don't know me. You never knew me. We're not friends. We're not friends. You don't know me until you got a drink with me or you don't know me if you don't know my brother name, we don't know each other. It takes flesh and blood for connections like that. And it's taken me to get to the last two minutes of my life to realize that. And I would do anything to have those two last minutes with my family. - [Charles] All right, let's leave it there. - Please, let call my baby sister. I just want to talk to her one last time, please. I'm begging you, please. [Kelly crying] Please. - It's over, Kelly. It's just time for the inevitable now. Okay? I'm very proud of the breakthrough you just made. Well done, Kelly. - He's not going to kill you. - He never was. - What's happening? - He wanted to kill the old you. The fake you. - What? - What do we always say about social media? - That nothing you see is real, right? [Sabrina screaming] [gun bangs] [Jill groaning] - It's sad. Nobody even knows you're missing. We've been texting your friends and family. You never spend time with them. Call them. And you've been posting. Nobody even knows you've been kidnapped. - Is that really how you want to live? Someone as popular as you, yet invisible to the naked eye. - And he did that for- - For you, Kelly. This has all been for you. And you made a miraculous breakthrough. You said it yourself; this is all bullshit. All those friends, those virtual friends, what were you doing it for? They couldn't help you. Kelly, this is your chance. Help us. We want to collaborate with you. Join us. Help reeducate the world and what they should be doing with their time. I'm building an army of social media de-influencers and I want you by my side. It's your second chance, Kelly. You don't have to take it, but I really hope you do. - This can't be real. This is not happening. This is not happening. - This is real, Kelly. Everything that's happening here is real. Everything you did before now wasn't. - It's all right. It's all right. 9-1-1 I need a police car and an ambulance, I guess. I found a young girl passed out in a factory floor. Please hurry. - Hey. Hey. Hey, hey, you're okay, you're fine, you're safe. What's your name? - Are they gone? - Who? - I want to talk to my family. - Just a minute. What's your name? - Kelly. - Okay. Are you hurt? - No. Yeah, yeah, yeah, they took my kidney. - Okay, let me take a look. - No, you're okay. No one took your kidney. - But there's a bandage and blood and- - Yeah, it's just a scratch. Have you taken any drugs or alcohol? - And my toe. - Yes, I can see that. May we take a look? - Ma'am, ma'am, did someone attack you? - What? - Did someone do this to you? We need to know if there was a crime here. We'll find them. - No. No crime committed. - Look, you can trust us. - I'm okay. - You're an influencer, right? - What? - I want you to think of me as a de-influencer. Good luck, ladies. You are going to need it. Hey, hey, wake up. Come on. We're going to get out of this, okay? - What's happening? - We were kidnapped. Do you remember? He told me I needed to help you to get out of this prison. - It's okay, we're going to escape together, okay? I'm going to get us out of here. Okay. Almost there, okay?
