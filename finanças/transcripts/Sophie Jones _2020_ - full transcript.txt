Kevin, have you ever done this before? Like... planned to hook up with somebody? Like, set a date? Yeah. No. Can I ask you something? What? Why do you want to do this? Do what? Come on. I mean, the timing of the whole thing is just... The funeral was... I just... I find you really attractive and you're a good actor, and you're smart. That's a turn-on. I mean, you said the other day in class that 'The Old Man and the Sea' was your favorite book and I just thought that was very wise of you. Well, that's very nice of you. Thank you. Now you have to say something about me. Something nice. I have to? Yeah. O... okay, um... you... uh, you... you have... I like your, uh, sense of fashion. Does that... is that weird? Do you want something else? I have... I don't know. Um, you should take this off, right? - Might get in the way... - Uh, yeah, for sure. Or something. Do you think you could give me a hickey? Why? I don't know, I... I think they're pretty. Aren't they just, like, popped blood vessels? Yeah. So? Okay. Just... Things have been weird. Death is weird. At least I've been coping well. I mean, I haven't been cutting myself or... drinking or taking drugs, so that's cool... I think. And your family? Uh, we haven't really talked about it since the funeral... which was so weird. I mean, all these... these strangers were there and, um... they all said they were my mom's best friend but... I mean, how could they have been if I had never met them, you know? How does that feel? It's good? - Sophieee! - Whaaat? Hi, baby, I love you. - Mwah. - Oh, okay. Love you, too. The claws. The claws... Hey, I'm sorry I'm late. It's okay. Hello. Okay, so we can... - Hey. - You're late, kid. You like your ladder, boy? I do. You should go check yours out. Okay, I will.- Whoa! It's okay, we're good, we're good! Stop being a drama queen. All right. Boo! Oh. So scary. I know. I saw that you were jumpy and I just saw an opportunity. I mean, I... I know this is stupid but I am a little nervous. Why? It's just tech week. I just... I want to be perfect. Which sounds insane, but whatever. I mean... you're gonna do great, Jones. - Don't even worry about it. - Okay, Riley. Thank you. What is this?! - What? - What even... did y... what... Don't touch! Let me... I just want to feel it! Okay, no! Don't do that. Hey. Hey, what's up? Um... I'm sorry, uh, about the... the hi... Oh, no, no, it's cool. I... it doesn't hurt or anything. Really? It hurts a little bit. It's fine, though. I'm sorry. - Yeah, it's... it's okay. - Okay. Um, break a leg. You too. How far have you guys gone? Um, we've only dry-humped and... and, um, made out a little bit. - Mm. - Mm. Sexy. Works to your advantage. What do you mean? Don't you MASTURBATE... Okay... BY HUMPING A PILLOW?! You do! Yes, I do... masturbate by humping a pillow. Okay? Don't know how that happened, I just... discovered it. What do you think is next? Like... are you gonna let him eat you out? No. Why? I mean, I just... I feel like I'm gonna laugh! That's, like, the way girls come. I'm going to laugh. It's going to tickle. It's not gonna tickle! How could it not? A person's, like, little tongue... licking my vagina? That's so... gross. It's not gross. I kinda wanna blow him, though. Really? - Yeah. - Yeah? I, uh... I feel like it gives me the power. You know? 'Cause I could just bite his dick off if I wanted to. - You know? - Yeah, yeah. Girls, are we set? Yeah. We don't have napkins. Okay, um... maybe paper towel. You excited about tomorrow? Sophie? What? Are you excited about opening night? Oh, um... yeah. Good. Actually, Dad, I was gonna ask you. I know this is kind of a huge favor but I was wondering if we could host one of the cast parties at the end of the month. Sophie... Yeah! - Yeah, what not? - Really? - Sure. - Dad... - That would be awesome. - Yeah, I think that'd be good. No, I don't think you understand. What? I mean, like, there's gonna be drugs and alcohol and sex and... I just don't think you should be promoting that kind of behavior. Well, I didn't know that's what happened at cast parties. - It doesn't. - It does. I mean, we're not hosting a party if... if that's what... if that's what happens, all right? Do you understand? Hey, Soph? What are we gonna do with all these flowers? - Hey. - Hi. Hey, what's up? Hey, uh, Sophie, uh, do... do you want to sit down? Yeah, sure. Wait, no. I don't really want to do that... right now. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. I'm not... I'm not gonna bite you. Wait. I'd hope not. I was... I was joking. Oh, okay. - But, um... - We don't have to. I can... I can do something for you. If you want, I mean. Like what? Um, you can switch with me if you want. - Okay. - Okay? - Yeah. - You wanna s... sit down? - Yeah. - Okay. Um... Maybe just... just stand up first. Okay. Um... Can you... do the rest? - Oh, yeah. - I'm sorry. Oh, shit. Yeah, okay, just, like, take them...? - Yeah. - Okay. Um... should I... should I take my underwear off too? Um, no, you should just sit down. - Just sit down. - Okay. Romantic. Um, it's fine. What's wrong? Everything's fine. Nothing, I'm fine. Hey. Hey. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I tried texting you last night. Yeah, I saw. - Uh, can you stay and... talk? - No, I have to go. Sophie, I just... Okay. So do you know a lot of people that are gonna be here? Um, kind of. Like, they're all in my... I mean, they're all in my grade. Like, I don't know if we're "friends" but... I know them. You'll love them and they'll love you. Okay. I'm serious, Soph. I'm serious! Okay. Do you need me to pluck that brow? It's like that crazy one that makes you look like Frida Kahlo. Can you blow on my face? Can you please blow on my face? Okay, I haven't even plucked one yet, so... I feel like these hairs just... I feel like you're picking my nose. You can pick my... Sophie, isn't that what best friends do? Ow. Okay, do you want brow gel? I just don't think I can walk in these. It's for fashion. It's for fashion. Hey, do you have a razor? Do I look okay? Yeah, you always look okay. I don't know. Wait, do I do this or do this first? So, are you guys going home together or, like...? What the fuck, Sophie?! I don't know! I mean, this is my ex. Oh, yeah! I'm so dumb. Hey. Hey, Sophie. Hi. Sorry, I just... I don't know if I'm supposed to be in here or... That's okay. Come in. You have a really nice house. Thank you. - Hey, Kate. - Hey. Um... who was that? You don't know who that is? No. For real? Yeah. That's Tony. He actually has a huge crush on you. No. Yes, he does! Oh, my gosh, in math class, he's always spacing out, and, like, when he wakes up, he says, "I had the most wonderful dream about Sophie Jones." You're joking. I'm not! You should totally fuck him. He has this long list of sophomore girls waiting to just suck his dick. He's kind of a legend. Okay. You know Savannah? Yeah. Okay, so she fucked him, right? And she told me that the first time they had sex, he put on 'Reservoir Dogs' and asked her to take a shower with him. His dad was upstairs the whole time. Seriously, it's so hot. Yeah, that's crazy. You should totally do it. So, um... you've had sex, then, right? Of course. You haven't? What's it like? I can't even begin to explain. Okay. I think I'm gonna go talk to him. Mm-mm, no. I will talk to him in class. I'll give him your number. It's the chase he's after. If you show you're into him, he won't be interested. You get it? Got it. Okay. Okay, do yo want some? Um, no, thanks. I... I don't do that. Okay, suit yourself. Oh my God, Riley, are... are you okay?! Okay. Fuck... Oh, God. Jesus Christ. Oh my God, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to laugh. That was mean. Not mean. You're fine. You have a little something. Oh. No, that side. What? Okay. Just put it in the toilet. Fuck off. Why won't you tell me about what happened with Kev? I don't really want to talk about that right now. I mean, ask him if you're so concerned. I did. He's... he's pretty torn up about it. Okay. I'd really... I'd really love it if you guys could be friends again. For my sake. Maybe just, like, all hang out and... I... I just miss you. I just... I should go. What? Where... wait, I'm your ride. I'll walk. Hey! Okay, honey, coffee is coming. - Morning! - Morning. - Thank you. - Do you want coffee? Um, I'm okay, thank you. All right. So, you and Brian, huh? How did you hear about that? There's nothing to talk about. I heard that he was looking at your butt. We went out to lunch. And that's it. Do you think you're gonna... bone? No! God, no. I'm sorry, what was that? Nothing! Nothing. Sophie's just being weird. Oh, my God. Brian, huh? No, it's not... She went on a date with Brian. I did not, I went to lunch! I went to lunch. You did? And we... we didn't even, like, go out, we just ate our own packed lunches in a hallway. It wasn't... You sat in the hallway and ate your pack lunches? Sounds like a date to me, right, Sophie? It's not a date! It's okay, you don't have to be so, like, mmm about it. - Like, it's fine, he's cute. - I'm not being "mmm" about it. - I gotta run. - Okay. All right, love you. Love you guys. It's your turn. Tony Robertson took you on a date? It's still crazy. We had sushi and then we went to his house afterwards and his dad was there and we all had tea... His dad?! Had tea together. Like a tea party? Yeah. That's so weird. He must really like you. I don't know, I... I don't want all this, like, extra stuff. So you don't want any tea? - No, I just... - No, seriously, why? I... you know, knowing someone wants me, like, to meet their dad, that's weird. Like, that turns me off. You know? It's weird. Not really. - I... - So what? I mean, I just... I like it being mindless more. Sophie, you know you can talk to me about... whatever, right? I know that. Okay, then maybe this Tony Robertson thing isn't such a good idea. Okay, well, what do you mean? I mean... it just seems like ever since your mom died, you've turned into this crazy nympho. I'm not crazy, Claire. I know, Sophie. But how many guys have you hooked up with since January? Only a few. Yeah. Only a few but, like, it's from literally what, nothing? I dated in middle school. Come on, Soph, that's not what we're talking about. I touched Ethan Williams' dick, remember? Yeah, we all did that. We all touched his dick. Look, Sophie, I just don't want you getting hurt. Guys are assholes. They don't have feelings. They just see us as objects that they can fuck. When they come, they leave. Have any of the guys you've hooked up with even made you come, Sophie? What are you even talking about? I mean, I'm talking about, like, pleasure. Do you feel pleasure? Have any of the guys you've been, like, made you feel like that? - Wh...? - Like... Like what? Have they made me feel pleasure? Yeah, they haven't, have they? That's not the point, Sophie. All I'm saying is that people have been talking. I'm just concerned. What people? People in my grade and people in your grade. You suddenly care about what other people think? I mean, I care what they say about my best friend, yeah! Why wouldn't I care? Well, I... I just don't care what people think about me. I don't. At all. So if you have a problem with me, you can just fuck off. I can fuck off? Sophie, are you joking right now?! Sophie! Are you gonna get your fucking lunch?! I mean, I thought you didn't want to. I mean, that's what I thought initially but... - Uh-huh. - Um... I have this theory, like... all these intense things happening in my life, it's a sign I should just lose my virginity too. I mean, I know it sounds crazy but I just feel like if I do this, then everything will balance itself out, you know? I just need to get everything out of the way, you know? Yeah. So, uh, are you gonna start smoking meth now? No. Look, I thought you wanted to have sex, okay? It wasn't just me. Listen. I do. Of course. I just want to make sure it's what you want as well. That's what I want, so... - Good. - So... Well, that's good. Ow. Ow. Am I... am I hurting you? No, of course not. Fuck. - Uh... - Um... Maybe you're just not wet enough? I don't know why, it's just not going in, you know? Okay. Are... are you nervous? - I can just, like, eat you out. - No, don't be stupid. Just push more. All right, you've got it. It's in. Oh, yeah. Oh, it's in. Wait... Oh, yeah, we're having sex. This is sex? Yeah. This is it? Yeah. - Wait... - Shhh. Wait. Stop. - Ow, what the fuck?! - Shit. What the fuck?! - I'm sorry! - What the fuck?! - Ow! - I'm sorry! I just don't want to have sex right now, okay? Fuck, that fucking hurt! What the fuck, Sophie?! Are you fucking crazy? - Ow! - I'm sorry, okay? Jesus. Fuck... What the fuck? Hey, Claire. It's me. I know we haven't talked in a while but I miss you and, uh, I'd love to talk soon, so just give me a call. Okay, bye. Hi, Mom. People keep saying that... you're still here. Like I can find you in my heart or something. It's not healthy to think like that. People say I, um... they say I have your eyes but... I don't know if that's... that's something people say to just be nice or... I don't know if I really do have your... your eyes. I, um... I really hope you're... you're not disappointed in me. I mean, all the guys I've been hooking up with, they're... they're hot, right? So, there's... there's something to that, I guess. I'm so sorry, Soph. It's whatever, you know? It's not, it's... it's not okay. I mean, at least he's a senior. He'll be gone next year, right? Yeah. Right. Wait, whoa. Sophie, no! Why not? You know why! This... this is not you. Okay, just, like... - No, I... - Wait. Riley, I know you like me. I can't do this with you right now. Oh, my God. Fuck you, Riley. - Like, for r... really. - Nice, nice. - Really. - Real mature. Fuck, close the fucking door, okay? Oh, I will, I will. - Oh, my God. - Fuck. I saw a hummingbird today walking home from school. And it flew up really close to me and... I thought maybe it was Mom looking out for me. Sophie, you wanna say anything? I'm gonna miss you so much next year. Sophie, it's just college. We're gonna talk every day, okay? I know. It's just you... You just have to look at school next year like it's your job. When you go to school, just pretend like it's work. - Simple. - Great. Hey, guys? - Hey! - Hey, Sammy. Do you want me to sign your yearbook? Um, maybe later. Uh, Sophie, would it be cool if we talked for a sec? Um, sure. Maybe in... in private? Okay. - Have fun! - Okay. So... what's up? Um, I heard about you and Riley. What about me and Riley? Just that, like, you kind of went to his house and tried to throw yourself on him. What? That you tried to force yourself on him. I'm sorry, what? It's just that he has a thing with my sister and I... Kate, yeah. Yeah, they've been dating for... - Did Riley tell you this? - Yes, he did. I just think it's kind of fucked that you'd try to do that. And you believe him? I mean, I just don't want Kate getting hurt. Is that okay? Okay. Well, you can tell Riley to go fuck himself. So it won't happen again? You can bet on that. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hi. What's up? Nothing, I just was writing. What's going on with you? I'm just, uh, getting some biking in. Cool, I see that. Um, actually, I'm, uh, headed to meet somebody, so I'm gonna, um... Oh. Well, I'm meeting someone too. I'm waiting for them here, so... cool. Oh. Cool. - Um... - Um... I just wanted to say I'm sorry. For what? Just how I freaked out, you know, a while ago in the bathroom and you probably thought I was insane or something. No, I... I mean, that was so long ago, so I... I just wanted to say, like, I... I did want to do it. I mean, like... ah, what am I saying?! I just, uh... I mean, panic attacks happen, right? You know? And, um, I'd like it if we could be friends. If that's okay. Of course we can be friends. Okay. I'd actually like that a lot, so... Cool. Yeah, just... text me and we'll... we'll hang out. Or we'll get coffee or something. Cool. - Well, see you later. - Okay. Bye. Good morning. Morning. How are you? Fine. Did you sleep okay? Is my hairbrush in here? Yeah. Thank you. We're almost out of toothpaste. Okay. I'll pick some up on the way home today. You got it all... wet. Well, you don't put your bra on the towel rack. - Such a random person. - I know, it's weird. Hey, I was actually wondering if, um, you could let me eat lunch with you today, just for today. I don't know, Sophie. If I say yes today, you're just gonna want to eat lunch with me and my friends every day. Well, you know, Claire just left and I really don't want to eat lunch alone, so... Why can't you just make a friend your own age? I don't like the girls in my grade. - We've gone over this before. - What about Riley? Things are weird still. He still hasn't apologized. Um, look, I have bio now, so... Okay. Please, Lucy? No, Sophie. I think he's gonna, you know, make the move. - Tonight? - Tonight! Wait, have you guys not, like, fucked before? Well, no, I told you, I wanted to take things slow. I thought you had. God, it's been, like, a while. What? I'm taking it slow. Hey, Kate. Oh, hey. Sophie, right? Right. So, are you guys gonna do anything fun after school? Uh, yeah, we're headed to Andrew's to smoke a bowl. Nice. - Yeah. - Cool. - Yeah. - I'll... I'll see ya later. See ya! Bye! So awkward. What... what's going on here? I don't know. What is that? What? What is this? I made it at camp. - You made it at camp? - Yeah. Do you wanna, like... What? Move that hand back, yeah. Arch them more, and then press more on this side. And then take that finger... and put it here. Move that there. Now press really hard. I like your necklace. You haven't noticed it before? No, I have. I just haven't said it yet. Oh. Sorry. Hm, yeah, mm. Okay, do you want to... do you want to talk or do you want me to sing something? No, you can play. Okay. ♪ I'd follow you to war ♪ ♪ No matter what you're fighting for ♪ ♪ And she would tear her seams ♪ ♪ Broken hearts can't find their sleep ♪ ♪ Broken hearts can't find their sleep ♪ ♪ I'm yours to keep ♪ ♪ As I shuffle through the notes ♪ ♪ You promised me lonesome when I'm on the road ♪ ♪ And I'm coming close ♪ ♪ To believing each word that you spoke ♪ ♪ To believing each word that you wrote ♪ ♪ The few that you hold ♪ ♪ The few that you hold ♪ - You're on birth control, right? - Yeah.

I asked you if... - Right. - You were on birth control. You're not on birth control, are you? Um... it's fine, you know, I'll... I'll take a Plan... I'll take a Plan B, so... All right. I should go. Why? It's so early. Well, what do you wanna do? I don't know, anything. See, this is what I was talking about earlier. What are you talking about? You just wanna fuck me and then leave. Look, you wanted to have sex this time. It wasn't me that initiated it, so it's not... No, no, I know, but... but for once, it would be nice if we could just do something else after. It feels like we're always having sex and then you're going home. Plan B is, um, it's most effective if you take it right away. I mean, you wouldn't want me getting pregnant, right? Ow, fuck. Hey. Are you okay? I'm fine, I'm just... thinking. About what? Um... what's your most terrible memory? I don't know. Why are you doing this? Haven't you read that New York Times article going around, "The 36 Questions That Lead to Love?" Yeah. Well, can I ask you a couple of questions from that? I thought you were going home. It's just, like, you're my boyfriend, I should, um... I should know everything about you, right? Yeah, but I don't think this is about that. I mean, you know my most terrible memory. It's... it's only fair that I know yours, right? I don't. Not really. Look, I know that your mom died, okay? But I don't know much else. You haven't really opened up to me about that. And hey, I really wish you would, you know? I want you to feel comfortable opening up to me and stuff. You don't open up much either, so... Well, there's not much to say. I, um... I went to school... the day my mom died. I skipped all my classes and I just... sat in the auditorium like all day. And then I went to rehearsal. During break, I went to get my phone and my dad had texted me "Where are you?" like 30 times. He just kept calling me. So I... I knew it was happening. So I ran home in the rain and I pounded on the door and my aunt let me in, and I raced upstairs. She breathed a couple of seconds more, like she had been waiting for me. My dad cried. It was the first time I had seen him cry. And my sister and I, we went downstairs. And I took a picture of a vase... with a white rose in it and some red wine in a glass. Then I went upstairs to say goodbye. My aunt had washed her body. And I kissed her on the forehead. Her body was yellow. And then the people came to... take her away. My dad told me to go downstairs but... I didn't listen, so I ran upstairs into my parents' bedroom again and I looked out the window. And I saw my mom being pushed into a black van. And then it just went away. So... I'm so sorry. Don't be. Hey, so when am I gonna meet my daughters' boyfriends? Oh my God, you have met them. No, I mean formally meet them. You know, they're... they're always avoiding my questions. That's why we don't bring them over. Why are we even talking about this? Um, I... I signed up for a... a dating site last week. And I'm gonna go on a date this week. Don't you think it's a little soon? Sophie... No, I really don't. I don't. I think this is what your mother would want for me. We're happy for you, Dad. Really. Thanks, Sweetie. Can you... can you just try and be more supportive? I mean, how does a person even move on so fast? You know? It's been a year, Soph. It doesn't feel that way to me. Me neither. You're serious? Yes, absolutely. Like, I feel like this is a mutual thing. You think that? Yeah. I just... I feel like I've become dependent on you. I just think it's good to be alone sometimes. So it's just a break, like for a short period of time? I mean, it's just a short period of time and we most likely will get back together, so... Great. You sure this has nothing to do with your mom? It doesn't have anything to do with my mom. The anniversary has nothing to do with this. Eyes are closed. Let's all take one deep inhale together. Fill your bellies and let out an audible sigh. Yeah. Hey, Sophie? Lily here is gonna give you a ride home. What? Um... my sister is about to pick me up, so... I really think it's for the best that she gives you a ride home. - Um... - Oh. Okay. Okay, great. So, why did Ms. Baum ask you to give me a ride? Um, she said that you'd, um... you... she said that you'd understand. Understand what? Are you okay? I don't know anything right now. Okay, can you please... can you pull over, please? Okay. Why are you crying? My mom died. I'm... I'm so sorry, Lily. I'm really sorry. It's okay. That's a lot. What did you do? I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't know what I did. I mean, you would... you would think I would know, right? Like, you would... I... I don't know. Do you ever feel like she's still around? Um... my sister... she thinks, um... our mom communicates with us in her dreams. Sometimes I think that's true. Hey, there. Hey. What ya working on? Um, chem project. Oh, yeah? Good. Okay, well, lunch is almost ready. Dad? Yeah, honey. What's your favorite color? Um... I don't know. You know, maybe, uh... you know, maybe it's forest green. Why? I... I didn't know Mom's favorite color and I... I think it's important that I know yours. Yeah. Fuck me up! Wait, Lucy, please don't. Oh, hell yeah! All of it, all of it, all of it, all of it! I read a book a while ago about how male gorillas leave fruit out in the rain for, like, months. And then they lure the women into drinking the stuff and then they rape them. Okay, Sophie, lighten the fuck up. Oh, my God. - Jesus! - It's true, it's true. I... I'm sure it's true, but we're not fucking gorillas. We've evolved a lot since then, my friend. Sophie, I love you, like, more than time can tell, but I'm not gonna kiss you for the third year in a row. I'm gonna go fucking find a guy. I didn't ask, but you do you. - Okay, I love you! - Okay. Oh, my God. It was cute. Wait, Sophie. What... what's going on? Um, nothing. Sophie! Aren't you together? We're fine, we're just taking a break. Okay, whatever that means. It's fine, he's his own person, he can do as he pleases, you know? Like, he's his own... You're staring. I'm not staring, I'm only staring because you brought it - up, so... - Okay, okay. - Okay. - Keep... keep saying that. Yeah. It's fine. Oh, my God. Sophie? Sophie! Hey, Sophie! Sophie. Um... what are you doing? I'm going home. What does it look like I'm doing? Um... are you okay? I'm fine! I'm just... I'm going home. Like, why are you following me? I'm not following you. I mean, you just looked upset so I... I... I'm not dating Kate, if that's... I didn't even care. I didn't even see you. Oh, okay. Okay? Okay. I just really want to go home right now, - so... - Why? 'Cause I just don't want to be here. I don't want to be doing this. Doing what? I haven't d... I haven't... I'm not... it's not about... I'm not talking about you. I just really want to get out of here, so... What, do you think I'm... Do you... do you need me to drive you home or anything? - Do you need a ride? - You think I'm drunk? I'm fine, okay? I'm not gonna get into my car and, like, crash into a pole or something. I didn't say that. Okay. Well, I'm great, so you don't have to worry about me. Clearly. You're fantastic. All right. Okay. I'll see you back at school or whatever. Yeah, happy New Year's. Yeah, you too. This is delicious. - Mm. - Mm-hm. I'm glad you guys like it. - It's wonderful. - Thank you for bringing it. Oh, you're welcome. I have to tell you the truth, I really messed up the first time around and had to throw one away. Well, it was worth it. You did a great job. - I'm glad you like it. - Yeah. Um, so Sophie, where are you thinking about going to college? Well... I didn't really go to any of my classes in high school. Um, so I'll probably be going to the one with the 89 percent acceptance rate. Which one is that? It's called, um, City Island College in New York City. Oh, that's fancy. You must really love big cities. Mm-hm. New York is way too crowded for me. Oh, I love crowds. The bigger the better, you know? But what are you thinking about studying? Well, um, I really would love to study acting, but my father over here would like me to study something more practical like English or History. Mm-hm. I just... I think it's a good idea to have a backup plan. Yeah. Yeah, always good to have some plan B, for sure. Yup. What about you, Denise? What do you do? Well, I teach kindergarten but, um, I actually really love to garden and that's one of my hobbies, and I actually really like to sing, too. Oh, how lovely! Yeah. You should sing us a tune. Uh, I think the quiche is the only thing I'll be contributing today. Mm. Well, maybe another time. Sure. She's actually a great singer. She sings for you a lot, Dad? No, not a lot but...- A little bit of singing. Oh, yeah, just... I just do it for fun. Mm, nice. So? What do you guys think? I liked her. She was really pretty and nice. - Good. - Yeah. Good. What about you? There's literally nothing wrong with her, so... Well, I'm glad you liked her. - Yeah. - Good. I'm glad she's nothing like Mom. What do you mean? She didn't make me laugh once. I'm gonna go clean up. Okay, do you want our help? I can do it. - Okay, thank you. - Sure. Why did you do it? Do what? Tell everyone that I tried to have sex with you. I don't know, I... I just... I've liked you since, like, the third... since, like, the third grade and... I guess I just wanted Kevin to know that... That I liked you too? Yeah. I'm sorry, that's... that's really fucked up. Maybe we should do this. What? You want... me to kiss you? Sure. Okay. Okay. Can I have this one? Uh, no. - Why? - That's my favorite shirt. But you never wear it. It's my favorite because I only wear it on special occasions. That literally doesn't make any sense, but okay. Stop. You're not doing it right. Just give it to me. I'm not folding clothes in a right way? No, you're... you have to roll them. I have to maximize the space in my suitcase. You have plenty of space. I'm going to New York. I'm going across the country, okay? It's far away. I'm gonna miss this. Miss what? Our fights, your annoying voice... My annoying voice? Yes! Will you miss me? Of course I'll miss you. Really? Yeah. Okay. Come here! Of course I'll miss you. Promise you'll call every day. Yeah, I will. I'll call every day. Don't worry. I'll harass ya, woman. Hey! Okay, show me how to do it. It's very simple. Spoken like a true master. Yeah, it's really quite simple. You just roll it up. Um... so you're going to ORU in the fall? Yeah. A full ride, so... That's... that's impressive. Thanks. I heard about you and Riley. That you guys... that you guys kissed and stuff. Well, uh... we're not together anymore so I don't really know why that matters. I miss you. Really? Yeah. I really do. I miss you too. I, uh... I think about you a lot. What do you think about? How you were there for me.
