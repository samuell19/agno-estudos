In the 1960s and 1970s, Hong Kong was in a dark age where corruption prevailed. Triads were given protection through bribery, so they are rampant criminals of prostitution, gambling, and narcotics. Two main figures dominated this Money Empire of Hong Kong. First, Cripple Ho, the kingpin of triads. Second, the all-powerful man in the Police Force, the most powerful Detective Sergeant, Lak Chui. Under their rule, as long as you are willing to pay, be it a job, a contract, a pass, power, or even freedom, you will have it. And what if you don't have the money? Then you must endure all injustice. You will lose your dignity and even your chance to speak up. - Stinky tofu is sold out. - Deuk Deuk Tong. - Check it out. - Steamed rice dumplings. I want to see what's changed. - Whatever. Welcome back. - Steamed rice dumplings. - Fried stuffed trio. Eat up. - Everybody is here. What do you drink? - Same as you. - Excuse me. Dig in. What are you doing now? I'm still a lawyer. So you are still low-level. I told you to be a shoe shiner like KC, but you refused. You would've been an administrative assistant in the Department of Justice. Who's KC? Kenny? Kenny Chan? - Yes. - Why would you care? What do you do now? I'm made marine police officer. No chance to catch big bandits. No need to be modest, tell him. You're a sergeant at the headquarters. That's good enough. I just got lucky. Come on! - Place your bets. - Go ahead, we will win. - Chop him. - Kill them all. Get your weapons. Hey, Ho sends his regards. Boss. Dad, I want this. - Do you want Deuk Deuk Tong? - Do you want this? - How much is it? - Police! Run! Let me pass! Give way! - Make way! - Run! Lak Chui. Everything is a mess. Those Taiwanese thought bribing the British people with a few hundred dollars immuned them from the rules? Wan Chai today, Causeway Bay will be tomorrow. I'm sorry to bother you at this late hour. I don't care. Lak Chui, you set up the rules. Four shares. We must be very clear about this. Sure. If I waste Jackson tonight, what would you think? I didn't know it in the first place. - Make way or I'll crush you. - Go. - Move. - You're in my way. - Dad... - Make way. - Dad. - Move. Police. Run. Kid. Kid. Call an ambulance! Get her to the hospital first. Be careful. Go. Let's go. Sir, we are being attacked. Attack. Go. Don't hit me. Help. Stop taking photos. On your knees. Let's go. - On your knees. - Hands up. Squat down. - Heads on your head. - Don't move or I will beat you. Squat down. Everyone, freeze. Put your hands on your head. Stop peeking. You, over there. Stand by the wall. You, get over there by the wall. You too, stand by the wall. You. Get over there. All of you, get over there by the wall. - Take them to the precinct. - One by one. Under the clutches of Lak Chui and Cripple Ho, the police and the triads became more rampant and lawless. To stop the situation from deteriorating, the Governor assigned Sir Jack Cater to set up the ICAC, aiming to disintegrate the money empire led by the two of them. The first mission of the ICAC was to recruit new members. My target was law graduates that were committed to upholding justice. Dear guests and fellow alumni. School of Law of Hon Lam University was established in 1969. Today marks its fifth anniversary. During these very short five years, the School of Law has already nurtured a number of elites in the field. Today, we have specially invited Mr. Lak Chui, Detective Sergeant of Criminal Investigation, to give us a speech tonight. The frontline law enforcers and members of the legal profession have been very good friends all along. With the solid friendship of these two, the legal system in Hong Kong has been well sustained. With the spirit of the rule of law in Hong Kong, our society gets to move forward in bold strides and all businesses flourish and prosper. So on behalf of everyone, I would like to thank all members of the legal profession present here. Mr. Lak Chui, do you mind if I ask you a few questions? Sure, go ahead. I witnessed a massive street fight at Lockhart Road, Wan Chai. You were there. During the incident, a six-year-old child was hit by a hawker's cart and went into a coma. However, officers at the scene released all the aggressors. May I ask if this is an abuse of discretion? I would like to express my deep regret for the incident last night. I admit we may have failed to meet public expectations in terms of manpower deployment. - Mr. Chui, excuse me. Sorry. - Police have taken prompt action. I'm not asking about manpower deployment. I'm asking why the aggressors were released last night. Moreover, there is no mention of the incident in any newspaper or by the police. Do you want to deprive the public of their right to know? Can the police force be corrupt and bribed without consequence under your shielding? You studied law. Then you should know the law. What you just said is a passing judgment before trial and at the same time violating a lot of legal provisions. If you have more information and evidence on last night's incident, I'd be more than happy to invite you to collaborate with the police. Speak the human language, please. I don't speak other languages, so I only speak humans. Mr. Lak Chui, are you admitting bribery and fraud? Please don't evade the question. Dear guests and fellow alumni... I will check him out and take care of the press. No paper will publish this tomorrow. Where did this filthy maggot come from? And this was how I found my first rightful partner. - Confess it. - I confess. The one that molested an old lady and pushed an old man was you, is that right? No, this isn't what you said just now. - He confessed, put it down. - Okay. Deal the cards. Let me kill it. - Pudgy. - Pudgy. Pudgy. I told you, no need to salute me. I'm not a police officer. - I respect you. - Assault? Elon. I assaulted the police. Elon, Pudgy is talking to you. All right. Pudgy. Pudgy, nice of you to drop by. - I'm here to check if you're still alive. - Take him there. - Thank you, Pudgy. - Go. - When will you pay me back? - Go now. Tomorrow, definitely tomorrow. What if you kick the bucket tomorrow? I dare not die tomorrow. Not until I have cleared my debt with you, Pudgy. - Jerk. - Here, Pudgy. Get your hands off me. Tomorrow, I will quit gambling. Don't you worry about me. Trust me, Pudgy. Give me a chance. Pudgy, please give me a way out. Run an errand for me. It will be an interest payment. You will knock off some interest? Sure! You despicable bum. Don't you have any shame? Call it the code of brotherhood. - What are you doing? Stop. - What is it? Let's go. - Nothing to see. Go. - Leave now. That's enough. He will die. Get lost, you're killing him. Get lost. - Move. What are you looking at? - Beat it! Come on. Don't you glare at me with those eyes. I am just carrying out an order. Just a word of advice. The fiercest and most powerful is always right. You offended Lak. You're bound to have rough luck. You got lucky to be dealing with me. If not for me, you would've been stabbed by a bunch of knives. Watch your step. Save yourself from infection. Why so late? I'm sorry. Don't tell me you are sorry. Tell the judge. We are not suing. Why? Someone broke my dad's leg this morning. He's now lying in the hospital. Those guys said we must drop this case. - Or they will break his other leg. - Calm down. Everybody is here. It's good you're not suing. Use the money to heal the leg. Calm down. With all the evidence, we will surely win. - Sorry. - I will ask for an adjournment. We're not suing, sorry. I reached out to Hank Chan when he was most lost, introduced him to the first Commissioner of the ICAC, Sir Jack Cater, and explained to him that the ICAC aims to eradicate corruption. Brimming with enthusiasm, Hank Chan agreed to join us in a heartbeat. The two of us ventured out to continue with our recruit and formed our first team of investigators. Congratulations, everyone. You have all passed the personality test. What ICAC wants is an honest and righteous government and to build an honest and righteous society. We need to combat corrupt criminals and transform the bad habit of bribery amongst the people. We all know that prostitution, gambling, and drugs have been controlled by the triads. But why are they so rampant? Because someone is covering for them. If we want to suppress crime, we should start with the people that protect them. And that's why our first target is the Police Force. Let me explain it to you. I have prepared some material. They consist of several categories. The first category is photographic material. Please memorize these important leads. Leila, please analyze them. We are an independent department. All we do must be kept confidential. You must not disclose everything, including who or what you've seen. Not to your parents, family, or your best friends, husband, or wife. - That's right. - Mr. Pak, take a look at this. Put it down first. Hold it like this. - Okay? - Okay. Understood? Wearing this uniform means we must uphold justice and serve those who trust us. - Okay. - Okay. Go. Go. Elon. Sure win! Screw this. Your hands stink! It's Lak. Lak, why are you so late? I was held up by some business. Please don't mind. Happy birthday. I wish you good fortune and health. - The present... - I already gave him. Although tonight is time to celebrate, don't drink too much. We have a business to discuss at Sunning Court tomorrow. Okay then... You're leaving? You must have a toast with me before you go. Okay. - You don't want to pay? - Do you want to leave? Shoot, you triads are reckless. - Say it again if you dare. - Elon. What are you doing, pinworm? It's not my thought. - These triads are cheating. - Shut up. You're so dead. Who do you think you are? - Handle it. - Beat him up. Sorry. Lak! Help! Stop. Sorry. Sorry. Lak. I'm sorry, Lak. Give me your gun. No, Lak. Please, Lak. Give me your gun. Pudgy. Lak, give me a chance. From now on, you are no longer a police officer. Don't bother reporting for duty tomorrow. Today is Ho's birthday, let's just leave it at that. - Lak. - Next time when you see him again, you can do whatever you want. - Get him out of here. - Please. - Go kill yourself. - Pudgy. Congee with pig's blood. Do you think he is trustworthy? You might as well trust the delivery guy. Good idea. You were beaten up by him. He didn't beat me up. You can call it instigation at best. He still has some human touch. What kind of standard is this? The British kind. Didn't you study psychology in Britain? You can see for yourself. Congee. What are you looking at? What are you looking at? Your face is cut. Darn it. I remember you. What do you want? Revenge? No need. You got your karma. Quit beating around the bush, spit it out. We want you to help us. What help do you mean? Help us to catch the police that break the law. There are ten factors to qualify a bad police officer. I met 11 of them. You're asking for a dirtbag like me to help you? Go away. You are the kind of person we need. What's in it for me? Cantonese porridge. If there's nothing in it for me, that's empty talk. You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, right? What in the world is he saying? He said you are a wretch that can't be made useful. Cantonese porridge. Thank you. Thank you. Having been a police officer for so long, has anyone ever thanked you? If word goes out that you are no longer a police officer, I think you will be in great danger. Join us. Take it as an opportunity to turn over a new leaf. This may be a way to pick yourself up and live with pride. Take this one. I haven't touched it. This little detective sergeant owns two apartments on Nathan Road, six shops, and four Rolls Royces. We have evidence to arrest him then. Let her finish. Go on. That's it. In the court, the judge, the jury, and the prosecution can easily be his people. There's nothing you can do about them. Unless there's someone who's not corrupt and not afraid to die will testify against him. We can sue this detective sergeant for wealth not commensurate with income. What is your offer? Last week, the British bosses asked my men to watch them take the winner circle picture at the Jockey Club. They partied with great food and had so much fun. Yet my men were being treated like dogs. Ho. Lak. Sooner or later, you will have to blend in. Just take it as socializing to maintain good relationships. I've already talked with them. If all goes well, I'll be Chief Chinese Detective Sergeant. Congratulations to you then. It's all expected. We're called Four Leading Detective Sergeants. We must have a real leader after all, like the Four Big Clans you are in. Just hearing that name drives me crazy. You always take the lead in everything they do. You can do it all yourself. Why do you care to share the jobs with them? The truth is that Joker, Comic, and Victor have been working with me for all these years. They have been quite compliant. Turf business in Hong Kong takes no more than the work of you and me. Otherwise, like the Wan Chai incident, when somebody invades another person's turf, you'll be dragged into it too. And also, about that supplier of yours, don't do exclusive anymore. If they shoot up the price, you will be at their mercy, right? I have a friend in Thailand, Colonel Chamanan. He has been doing well. His products are nice. Let me discuss the basics with him first. Then you can go to Thailand and talk details with him, okay? I didn't expect our future Chief Chinese Detective Sergeant is working so hard on this. Looks like I should start taking Thai lessons. Hello. It's time for me to go. Let's do this. Pack some clothes for me when I get home. Tomorrow morning, you two will go to Thailand with me. Chamanan. Cripple Ho started off as a drug dealer. When his drugs arrived in Hong Kong, Lak Chui would guard his boats and disembark the drugs. After the drugs are onshore, another team of police officers will be there to help him. The leader of that team is called Jan. Jan and Lak Chui met at the police academy. Also, he is Pudgy's close friend. That's why Lak Chui trusts him and puts him in charge of lookout. The cargo receiver on Cripple Ho's side is his top guy, Wayne. They are secretive when unloading the cargo. The ship never berths directly at the pier. They use fishing boats to land the drugs. The drugs are then packed in fruit cartons at the pier and sent to the fruit market. They've set up posts there. It's very hard for an outsider to meddle in. I'm getting a massage after work. You, again? You can't skip it for once. The police. I'll deal with it. - Jan. - Hey. This is Lak's business. Patrol some other districts first. Noted. We're done. Let's go. The Preventive Service isn't here yet. What now? Notify Mr. Pak. They're leaving early. The Preventive Service? They are coming. Need a few more minutes. Get back. Come with me. The Preventive Service. I suspect there is contraband in your car. I'm Hong Kong Police, we are on a case. I don't know. We received information that there are drugs in the car. We need to search for it. Stop it. - Don't take pictures. - Careful. - Go away. - Don't mess with the evidence. - Step back. - Capture that. - We're working. - Don't step on the evidence. Don't take my picture. - Step back. - Take your pictures farther back. - If you take pictures, move back. - Go away. Step back. Tell Lak. Hello, what's up? How did that happen? Lak. The Preventive Service busted Ho's goods. Count the goods. Stop. Stop. Who is in charge here? Mr. Chui. What happened to you people? Mr. Chui, the Preventive Service Team just uncovered... I'm asking, what are you doing here? Don't you know we are following this case? These two are my men. We were following these two cars. We will seize the gang when the drugs get to its warehouse. But now you have hijacked us. Who will be responsible for our wasted manpower, resources, and time? We received intelligence to come... Tell me who was the one that leaked this out. I'm just following orders. Take everything back to Tsim Sha Tsui Police Station. They are court evidence. Hurry up, get going. What are you two doing? Go. - They are... - They are my men. You know me. Come find me if you have any problems with this. I know you are doing your job. Don't worry. Stop standing around, wrap it up. Are you still taking pictures? - Beat it. - Scram. Lak, the reporters took pictures of the goods. I'll pressure the press. No need. It can be a good promotion. Divide the goods into 2 batches, 90-10. The 10% batch will be used in the press conference. Send the rest to the police station. After that, change the car. Deliver immediately. Do not impact our daily operations. Got it. In the early hours today at Yau Ma Tei, the police cracked a drug-trafficking case and seized 3.8 kg of heroin, which is the largest heroin smuggling case of the year. Mr. Chui. Last night, I was at the scene with a few reporters. I saw more than ten fruit cartons. We have reason to believe the drug seized was far more than this. What you said is just the drug dealers' common trick. Most of them would hide the drugs among other goods, so as to pass them off as normal goods and fool the police in the search. I want to hear from you that you are sure all the drugs are here. Miss, I have already answered your question. I have a special edition of a newspaper here that is already published. The picture in it clearly shows some policemen transferring drugs from fruit cartons into the evidence boxes, then transporting them out of the precinct. The fruit cartons in the picture look identical to those seized last night. They obviously belong to the same batch. If I tell you now that this batch of drugs belongs to another case, what would you say? Why didn't you verify with the police in advance before you published it? Isn't this misleading the public in a way? Mr. Chui, can you tell us the procedure for handling cases? The procedure is highly classified. Can you explain why drugs were transported out of the precinct? If drugs go into the precinct, they must go out somehow. They need to go to court. The police cover for Cripple Ho, how do you respond to this? Is Cripple Ho a real name or is it a nickname? Ng Sai-ho. Do you have any proof to accuse him of drug trafficking? Can you show me the proof? Surprisingly, senior police officer... Do you see what's going on? How should I explain this to the governor? Sorry, sir. I will handle this. You made this mess! Now you have to clean it up. Ridiculous. Those British people are totally out of line. I didn't hear him groaning when he got his share. Our governor is back from England in three days. Apparently, he wants to see us. Maybe you can ask the governor how much he wants. I can really save a big share as a gift for him. Do you think this is funny? Maybe you don't understand the situation. Your promotion is currently on hold. Okay. No problem. I'm fine with it. So starting tomorrow, let someone take over the fee collection. My men will stop turning in bonuses for three months. So you can take over slowly. You British living in Hollywood Road should take a walk along the streets of Wan Chai. Do you know what a mess the streets used to be? Without my rule, the various businesses wouldn't run smoothly. People wouldn't have jobs. Also, that stupid British people stirred up trouble here. He broke the rules and marked turf randomly. What shall we do about that? Don't worry about my side. I will deal with it. You... You were caught red-handed. Someone has to take the blame. And for this. - Happy birthday to you! - Happy birthday to you! - Happy birthday to you! - Happy birthday to you! You look smart. Let Grandpa give you a kiss. Lak. I should have gone downstairs to greet you. It's not much of a gift. Happy birthday. Thank you. Give this out. - Thank you, Lak. - You're welcome. Thank you, Lak. All my achievements are your blessings, Lak. Come on. You've taught me a lot over the years. Lak, you are kind to me. Unlike my son. He wants to take my granddaughters to Britain. He said the education there is better. But my granddaughter keeps asking me to tag along. It aches my heart. Will you go and never come back? I have thought about it. Haven't made up my mind. Lak, give me some advice. What advice can I give? I remember you said you'd witness me promoted to Chief Chinese Detective Sergeant. That shouldn't be a problem. I know you will get there. I'm not saying I won't. But I want to toast with you when that day arrives. Are you turning me down? I want to. For real. Did Jan join me first or did you? I did. Jan joined right after me. The British people gave me three days to turn in a scapegoat. Somebody took pictures of Jan in the fruit market. They are published in the papers. You tell me what to do. Jail time will be longer if he's on trial. How about this? Let him plea guilty. Then we plan his escape. This lighter still looks quite new. A present from you. It's precious to me. You are a man that values friendship. I learned that from you. Then let's just do as you say. Pudgy, do we have to do this? If I sign it, I will go to jail. Sign the confession statement first. I will send you to Thailand to hide away for a while. Keep this money on you. I will keep remitting money to you. The problem is not with money. I am worried about my family. If I get into trouble, what happens to them? By then, no money can help me. Are we brothers? Yes. We've been brothers for 20 years. Now you don't trust me? It's not that. You don't have to trust me. But you have to trust Lak. You know him since childhood. If he says you are okay, you will be okay. Ask your family to move in with me if you are worried. If anything happens, I will die before them. Signature How much longer? We haven't reached the high seas. I'm hungry. Is there anything to eat? How about shark dumplings? What are shark dumplings? What are you doing? Shark dumplings. Help! Help! That's a wrap. Faster. Elon? Why are you here? Mr. Jan Tse. I am ICAC investigator, Elon Chan. Whatever. Can you talk to them and let me go? I don't want to stay here. Sure. You may go now. What will Lak Chui do if he knows you are still alive? I am very worried about my family. Have a seat. The only thing you can do now is to cooperate with us. Stand up to them and testify against them. I really hope you may list out everyone, be it the sergeants, inspectors, detective sergeants, or the Commissioner, whoever is involved in corruption and drug trafficking. Every single one of them. If you don't do that, I cannot help you. Apart from that, each of their roles in this business, their private lives, their hobbies, household size, whatever you know, you have to give a detailed account. Understand? You're asking me to play with fire. Jan, this is not a game. Today, we rescued you from the sea. I can't guarantee the same next time. I'm going to need more papers. Gambling stalls, drug houses, lottery stalls. They have everything. I'm not bluffing. The rats in our police station are as big as cats. Have you seen one? Timmy, are you done bluffing? Elon. Hank. Welcome to our big family. Thank you. I love the atmosphere here. Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to announce today that the government of Hong Kong has established a new department, the ICAC, Independent Commission Against Corruption, to regain the trust of the people of Hong Kong. It is my hope that you will join in supporting us to ensure the safety of all the citizens of Hong Kong. The Governor, Sir Maclehose, thinks it is necessary to set up a brand new organization to combat corruption. Its name is ICAC. Its aim is to combat corruption. Corruption still exists in the old anti-corruption department. - Yes. Unless they catch someone big. - Herbal tea, please. Please report to the ICAC. We are ICAC investigators. Detective Sergeant Ray. I'm Timmy Chan, ICAC Investigator. - What is it? - Detective Sergeant Ngao. Are you enjoying yourself? - Kill it. - Place your bet. - Open it. - Detective Sergeant Chan. What do you want from it? How did you get all the assets, properties, and luxury cars? I won in horse racing. What's wrong with that? The money is made by my wife who has worked as a bar girl for 20 years. Your wife is over 90 kg. Yes, she's fat and beautiful. She's very popular. Do you think it's funny? Did you know that everything you say can be used in court as testimony? Don't scare him. Do you feel cold? Let me get you another cup of coffee. I don't want it. I don't want to drink it. Please let me use the restroom. I'm going to pee myself. The restroom is under renovation. Do you want a spitoon? Please let me sleep. Sure. Tell us again how you got the money. Then you can sleep. You know well it is pay-off money. Why do you keep asking? Why so late? I was just getting midnight supper. Do you want some? You have a dimple on the chin. What's up? The devil's within. The devil is in that room. I've got to go. He's all yours. Sure. - Do you really don't want to eat? - No, thank you. Okay. The horse won by a nose, but last time... We offer three meals for witnesses. Midnight supper is not included. I can't go out to eat. Let me return a favor to you. What? In this race, Number 8 "Dancing with the Dragon" is in very good shape. The jockey can win with his eyes shut. So the horse will win because you said so? Its owner has just won three races in a row. I've quit gambling. Let's do this. It's 100 dollars each. One bet on Win and Place each, then we split the winning. You're talking like we must win for real. Nobody can be sure. Fine, it's up to you. I've been losing for a year, now we have a sure-win. But you're not going for it. How about this? I'll pay for it all. If I win, you can get a share. What do you say? - How is their performance? - Jockey and horse are both in a low mood. You're desperate, aren't you? I'll be back soon. You can see that this combination matches well all together... You're already back? This is bad. I'm doomed. I'm doomed. I'm doomed. I'm doomed. Help! I knew something bad would happen. Jan said it like it was real, so I believed him and went to place the bet for him. I believe you. But you have to promise us not to gamble anymore from now on. Trust me, Hank. - Sharon, come in. - Look ahead. We will figure out our next step. Loosen up a little. Relax. Mr. Pak. Get a detailed statement from Elon. Why do you still need a statement? Don't you believe me? I'm still accountable to the British boss. Don't worry if you're innocent. Shall we do it in the Interrogation Room? No need. Just do it outside. Come. A man like him... - Elon, have a seat. - Why does Mr. Chan trust him? Right? Who did he use to work for? The police. - His superior? - Stop. - Don't talk behind his back. - Lak Chui. He may be lying all along. Do you mind telling me what exactly happened that night? No good man would be a police officer. - He said... - He must've done it. - Don't blame him. - That horse was going to win for sure. - He told me to bet for him. - It's a fact. - I think he did it. - When I got back... Look what a mess he made. Talk louder! Keep talking! Why did you stop? Admit what you've done. Shut up. Elon, they're talking crap. Ignore them. Talking crap? Do you think I can't hear it? Am I a bad person forever just because I've been a police officer before? You've been in charge of Jan Tse. - He died once you took over. - Enough. Are you done fighting? We can suspect any person, but we must have proof. You're just a bunch of babblers. Every one of you was recruited by Mr. Pak and myself. We believe in every one of you. Sharon. Take Elon to Mr. Pak's office to finish the statement. Yes, sir. After this, take a vacation. I don't need a vacation. Everybody is biased against me. There's no point staying. Hank. Sorry. Elon. Elon. He is dead. They killed all detective sergeants we are investigating. Lak Chui is beginning to fight back and take initiative. If the proper legal approach cannot touch him, is there any other way? He has the money to bribe people, but he cannot bribe the whole of Hong Kong. Let's use pressure from the public. Public opinion. The most important thing is public sentiment. To win people's hearts, we must stick to reality and meet people's will. When people realize what we're doing is for their good, we will have their support. If you cooperate, we will protect you. When the people are on our side, the police will undergo tremendous public pressure. This is also our biggest bargaining chip. ICAC. Please come with us. The ICAC appeals to the public that if you are met with bribery or corruption, please report to the ICAC immediately. All information and identity of the informer will be kept confidential. The hotline is 266366. Since the ICAC was established, they have committed to eradicating corruption in the Police Force. They have arrested more than ten high-ranking officers to assist in the investigation. With overwhelming publicity and education through television and newspapers, the anti-corruption image of the ICAC has taken root in people's hearts. They gained the support of the public. Whenever met with such circumstances, they report to the ICAC immediately to combat corruption. ICAC Investigator. Please report corruption. If you too wish to report the crimes of this corrupt police force, please report to the ICAC. It's a war of public opinion. They keep advocating anti-corruption. Now the police are being scolded wherever they go. Ho, what do you think? For so many years, we haven't stepped on each other's turf. Lak, whatever you decide to do, I will not question it. I have an idea. Tomorrow, gather all the reporters here. What would you say if all the police in Hong Kong suddenly disappeared altogether? Wouldn't it be chaotic? That's great. Dear friends of the press, dear reporters. In view of the fact that a handful of police officers have been invited by the ICAC to assist in their investigations, the public is very concerned about corruption among police. In order to relieve the public's worries, I hereby announce, with immediate effect, that we will set up an internal investigation committee. All police officers involved in corruption will be suspended immediately. - We will also carry out rigorous - Condemn the ICAC. Integrity checks and financial investigations - until the public worry is lifted. - Condemn the ICAC. The four months of ICAC investigation crisis is aimed at the Police Force. The Police Force took initiative. - Deployment is under adjustment. - Robber! - Robber! - Triads took advantage of a power vacuum. - They stir trouble everywhere. - Help. Robberies, burglaries, and assaults are reported in the city, seriously undermining the safety of the general public. Hong Kong citizens claimed Hong Kong needs the police to enforce the law and end this chaos to restore social order and ensure the city's prosperity and stability. What are you doing? Stop! What are you doing? Who is it? Who is it? Gas meter recorder. Nurse. Are you related to the patient? I'm her fiancé. Let's have a word outside. The patient is emotionally unstable. She was abused. Spend more time with her. As a doctor, that's about all we can do. What do you want? Get him a pair of chopsticks and a bowl. You sit here. Get him cutlery. The rest of you, leave us. You look furious. Have a beer to cool down. You forced me to negotiate with you. I'm here now. What do you want? Do you know you are destroying Hong Kong's existing rules and thriving ecology? Over the past years, people's lives have been content. More importantly, we have built a trust system amongst people. Are you too used to taking bribes? You love to defend corruption. The ideal you people have will never become reality. Harmony, equality. Is it merely a phony slogan or a beautiful lie? Do you think there is no corruption in Britain? Why doesn't the British set up an anti-corruption bureau in their country, but instead set up one in Hong Kong? Now you have power and authority. Of course you think everything is okay. But if you lose your place one day, you will be left with no power and bullied by those in power. By that time, you will need the law. Kid. It's good to have ideals. But people with their own agendas will manipulate ideas to mislead you into doing things that are not ideal. Let's leave it to social judgment. Everyone is well-fed and happy. What's wrong with that? I will arrest you with my own hands. I have carefully checked the wrapping paper of the drugs and consulted my reliable former colleague. He said the Tai Po gang and the fruit market gang have made many contacts and done many trades. I found out the drugs all led to this abandoned farm in Tai Po. Although it is abandoned, it is crawling with Cripple Ho's goons and cops. It is only logical that is the warehouse where Lak Chui and Cripple Ho store drugs. Ron, I need you to point out clearly when their security is the weakest. Understood. Let's have a break. Come. I think the whole thing is off-tracked. We are anti-corruption, not anti-narcotics. All this time, we have been doing things by the book. So we are always one step behind. Would a robber ever write a report before committing crimes? I'm not challenging you. It's not about efficiency. What you are about to do is beyond our authority. We've been investigating their financial resources. Taxes, bank accounts, income, everything about money. They already took precautions. We roused the public, so he started a strike. When we got witnesses, he killed them off. How can we go on? This is our chance. He would never guess that we are after their drug trafficking route. - Let's get moving. - Copy that. Give me a cigarette. Follow me. Stay here to keep watch. Nothing. The boxes are empty. Don't smoke if you don't have a lighter. Sorry. Timmy. Timmy. Bolt the door, keep it shut. Get a hammer. What are you doing? Do you want to go back? No, Wayne. Now I will count on you and Ho... Go. - Go. - Run. Go. Go. Stop running. Go away. Dodge. Protect the ladies. Take care of them. Mr. Pak! Mr. Pak. Mr. Pak! Mr. Pak! Save me, Mr. Pak! Mr. Pak! The gun! Mr. Pak. The gun. Go. Go. The gun. Get them out of here. Charge. Kill him! Let's go. Straight ahead. You can get out through the second door. Go. Go. Go. Mr. Pak. In loving memory of Nash Pak Until I succeed, I am not qualified to bow to you. Wait for me. Pudgy has worked for Lak Chui for years. He must know well how Lak Chui collects bribe money. He's also his biggest human accounting book. If Sharon can memorize all the data, I trust he can too. If only he becomes our stain witness, we have a shot to arrest Lak Chui. Pudgy. Pinworm, you're finally out of your den? ICAC. Please come with me for our investigation. Get lost. Please. Mr. Fung. Would you mind emptying your pockets? I can smoke, can't I? Your watch and ring. Give me a battery. Okay. The coffee at Honolulu Coffee Shop is better. Turn off the lights. I have a friend who is also my colleague. His name is Nash Pak. During our investigation of the Tai Po Farm case, he was ambushed and killed on duty. I think you are aware of that. You eagerly invited me here just to introduce a dead person to me? He was very persistent in his work. No one could stop him if he wanted to do something. He was the same as you are. I know you won't talk no matter how I try. But you know very well what Jan Tse's fate was. Lak Chui becomes Chief Chinese Detective Sergeant. So what? You spend your life working for him? I won't leave until he kicks me out. What about your family? Cut to the chase. I'm listening. Mr. Fung, thank you for your cooperation. Pinworm. Ho. Thank you. I can help myself. Ho. You don't have to go to Thailand for now. Chamanan was... Some things are hard to explain. Maybe somebody took things into his own hands. I'm not bothered. We were never close. It was merely business between us. I won't dwell on it. We have other means to get rich. All these rewarding sources can't all vanish all of a sudden. That will be a lot of fun. It's a blessing for everyone to see addicts signing up for rehab. Lak is really awesome. You are surrounded by all these fortune sources, you won't need me anymore. Ho. You really can't say that. I'm responsible for setting rules for collecting the rents. How can I not need you? If not for you, who will pay the rent? I can't just step in and do it myself. I really wear my heart on my sleeve. I'm trying to provide a backup plan and a guarantee. Do you understand? You got help all around you. Just assign one of them to do it. Say Pudgy. He's your right-hand man. Put him in charge. - Ho... - You'll never believe it. But Pudgy doesn't know anything. Say he gets to call the shots. - The business may grow bigger. - Don't mess with me. It may be even more interesting. Stop messing with me, I will die for sure. I won't bother you guys anymore. Excuse me. It's time. I have to go. Ho, let's talk again some other time. Follow Lak Chui. Victor. Lak. Pudgy. Take a trip with Victor to Thailand. Lak, did you buy a tour trip for me? Thailand is too hot. I'm too fat for the heat. Pudgy, you are funny indeed. Lak sent me to Thailand to explore new businesses. Pudgy is a sweet talker. If he goes with you, he will make a good icebreaker. Lak, are you serious? When is the flight? Lak, tomorrow 8 p.m. That is so rushed. Go home and get ready for it. See you tomorrow, Pudgy. What? It's only you and me now. You can spill it out. Sit. Lak, you are upgrading Victor's position. You got beef with him? I have nothing against him. But if Ho finds out, it won't be very nice. Come on. Didn't you hear what Ho said? Clearly, he's going to bow out. What then after he left? Who takes care of the drug business? Do you want the addicts to quit drugs? That'd be nice. Of course not. Everyone will have eyes on that place by then. If everyone wants to claim a share, what do we do? There will be chaos. So we centralize the source for easy management. Is that right? Now I see you really are a simple person. No wonder everyone likes you. Lak. Just let me collect money for you. I know nothing about drugs. Let Victor discuss costs, routes, and trafficking. You just keep the drinks and cigarettes flowing. You're good with that. Keep everyone happy. Didn't you say you wanted to retire? Take this as the last job for me before you retire. Okay? Get it done, then you can really retire. Then you can take your family to travel around the world and enjoy life. You don't need to work so hard anymore. Is everything recorded? Yes. Make a copy for me. Understood. I will go now, Ho. Ho. Everyone will have eyes on that place until then. If everyone wants to claim a share, what do we do? There will be chaos. So we centralize the source for easy management. Is that right? Now I see you really are a simple person. No wonder everyone likes you. Lak. Just let me collect money for you. I know nothing about drugs. Let Victor discuss costs, routes, and trafficking. You just keep the drinks and cigarettes flowing. You're good with that. Keep everyone happy. Sir, here are your boarding passes. Thank you. How about yours? Your boarding gate number is 33. You have 45 minutes before boarding. - That's plenty of time. - She doesn't like you. Beat it. Next one, please. I'll be waiting for you. Pretty girl. You look familiar, what's your name? Mine is Victor. - Honey. - Are you shy? - Give me face. - Victor. What a coincidence! Are you taking a trip? Yes. I'm going to Thailand for a massage. That's awesome. Gosh. Pudgy, watch out. Run, Pudgy. Run. Help. Help. - Sir, what is it? - Someone wants to kill me. Drop your gun. Go away. Will, are you crazy? Is there a misunderstanding? I will explain to Ho. Everybody, stay down. Don't move. Wayne. You know it's not my idea. None of this is my idea, Wayne. Wayne, don't. Wayne, don't. Let's talk about this. Wayne. Don't do this, Wayne. Wayne, put your gun down. Wayne! I can go with you to see Ho. Ho has been treating you well, but you betrayed him. That's not what happened, Wayne. Listen... You guys, go. Go. Retreat. Go. - Go, boss. - My brother! Go! Only Lak knows I'm going to Thailand. Victor is dead. Ho sent someone to kill me. How does he know? Wayne and Wil are both Ho's men. You are stuck between Cripple Ho and Lak Chui. This is a difficult position. What is your plan? You can't be so lucky every single time. Stand up and testify against Lak Chui. I will make you a stain witness. I will plead for you. You want me to testify against all of them. That is a death sentence. I will ask the Governor to grant British residency to you and your family. With this arrangement, things will be easier. Stop it. I cannot do that. If you say yes, trust me. I only need one week's time. Everything will be taken care of. Think about it. Are you all right? I'm fine. Don't worry. Lak is here. He told us to pack up and leave now. Lak. See who's home? Grandpa. Grandpa. She is great. Connie is really a good girl. So many things have happened in these few days. I want to find a place to let your wife settle down first. Then she can rest in Thailand. Don't pack too much stuff. Buy them when you get there. It's heavy. Thank you, Lak. Go back to your room. Pudgy, now what? What are you thinking? Lak, I really don't know what to do. Give me some advice. How can I give you advice? The whole deal is that Ho sent people to kill you and Victor. This is a trap set by the ICAC to make us fight against each other. What do you think? But you cannot deny many Hong Kong people are on their side. So what? So Hong Kong people don't support me now? No, that is not what I mean. From a police constable to Detective Sergeant, I've seen so many British people taking advantage of Hong Kong people. They trample on us. They charge all the hawkers as much as they want. Who negotiated with them? - You did. - Who fixed the Four Big Clans? You did. Who to pay, who to take, when to pay, when to take, everything is bound by rules. Of course I know you have your ideals. What you do is mostly right for the good of Hong Kong. But time has changed. The rules that you laid down have been messed up. Even you yourself have changed. You have become so ambitious that it grows and grows on you endlessly. I am speaking the truth. Since the ICAC has been set up, the rules of the whole game have changed. We are not needed here anymore. Heroes are made in critical times. Lak, you should understand. I know you do not fear them, but in the heat of the storm, can you choose to hide away for a while? Honestly, I really want to spend a few more years with my family. Pudgy. No wonder everyone really likes you. You want to have an easy life, but when the ICAC found you and treated you to a coffee, you spilled out everything. All of it. Really. Lak. Lak. Pudgy. I heard that Huaxi Street is very busy with bright colorful lights. It's even busier than Hong Kong. My friend said their Dan Tsai noodles are very delicious. Let's see if we can find time to make a trip there to try it. I have to go. The Governor has granted British residency for your whole family. The money used to bribe the police in Hong Kong is around 780,000 dollars per day. 40% of which will be shared by station sergeants or above, 30% for detective sergeant level, and 20% for inspector level. The remaining 10% will be shared amongst all the PCs. Profits made by gangsters under the protection of the police will be shared between them and the precinct involved. Take the drug trafficking case in Yau Ma Tei as an example. Lak made two million from the deal. Detective Sergeant Lam. We are investigators from the ICAC. Please come with us for an investigation. This is a police station. The gambling houses protected by Lam Kong can bring him 400 to 600 thousand dollars every month. The nightclubs and drug stalls under Samuel and Vincent can bring them 500 to 700 thousand per month. To facilitate management and control malignant competition, all illegal operations must be approved by the Four Big Clans and the Four Leading Detective Sergeants. ICAC investigators. This way, they can control the crime rate constantly at a low level. What are you afraid of? Are you afraid that after arresting you, the police will come for me? There are 30,000 police in Hong Kong. They have all taken my money. If they dare to make the slightest move, I will be informed. They are just like the British people in the past. Someday they will talk things through. When they get the sum they want, they will stop. Ho, there is a lot of police outside. Take a look. Ho, they are all marine police. Darn it, let's kill them all. Boss, let me see if there is another way out. You leave first. What about you? This is my home. Now go. How long? One minute. Freeze! Ho, run! I'll keep them out, you run! Your biological brother has been caught. If you get caught tonight, who will be looking after your old-aged mom? Go. Ho. Thank you. ICAC. You are under arrest. Who are you? Do you know who I am? Let go of me! You're hurting me. I can find someone to kill you. Mr. Ng Sai-ho. ICAC. You may remain silent. Anything you say can be used against you in court. So you are Hank Chan. Do you need to wear a black hood? Lak, take a rest. We will be in Taiwan in a few days. When I was little, my dad and I rode a boat here from Haifeng. It was pitch dark all around us. Now everywhere is bright and lit up. Now the British people dug up the grounds to reclaim the sea, making the harbor much narrower. And below our feet is where they built a cross-harbor tunnel. No one takes the ferries to cross the harbor now. A lot of things have become obsolete. It's time for me to call it quits. It's a good thing for young men to have ideals. I hope you are right. In loving memory of Nash Pak Your favorite, fried stuffed trio. You are exceptional. I've never sent flowers to Yanni all these years. In loving memory of Nash Pak We did it. I don't know if I would see a world with zero corruption in my lifetime. But sometimes, you don't keep fighting because there is hope. Instead, you keep fighting so there will be hope.
