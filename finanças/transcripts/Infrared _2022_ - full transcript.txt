Hey everyone, it's Wes Wheatley here, and we're on location at Sarah and Ian's residence, where evidently, nightly, Sarah has been rising out of bed and wandering around the house with no knowledge of having done it. And Ian is afraid that his wife might be possessed by a demon. We're here at the house right now to investigate, to find out, if Ian's concerns are valid. Let's go meet the couple. Come on. This is Ian and Sarah. Ian, hi. Hey. - Wes. - Wes. - Good to meet ya. - Yeah, yeah, man. Glad you're here. All right, let's go. - You ready? - Yeah, yeah. We're here in Ian and Sarah's living room, where Sarah has agreed to allow us to perform a deliverance, otherwise known as an exorcism. I have a book of demonology here, just in case, depending on the spirit that has possessed Sarah. When it comes forward, we'll see if we need this book. Sarah, the way that an exorcism works is not like, you might be accustomed to seeing in the movies. I don't know if you watch horror movies, but it's nothing like that. Usually, it's actually a very subtle, a release in the shoulders with tingling on the back of the neck. So, what I want you to do is that I want you to pay close attention to how you're feeling in your body. Demon, in the name of Jesus Christ, I command you, surface now. Shh. Sit still. Look at me. Demon, in the name of Jesus, I command you to show yourself, now. Look in my eyes Sarah. Demon, I am talking to you. Oh, God. In the name of God, I command you to show yourself, now. Demon, in Jesus' name... Do you wanna kill her like you killed the other one? - Randy, you got the... - Do you want to kill her like you killed the other one? Is that what you want Randy, grab her! Hold her down! Demon! - Is that what you want? - Demon, I command you... - Do you want to kill her like you killed the other one? Is that what you want? - To leave this vessel now! Wes? - Demon... - Is that what you want? I command you... - Sarah! - To leave this vessel now! - Is that what you want? Demon! In the name of God, I command you, to leave this vessel now! Demon, in the name of God, I command you, to leave this vessel now! Demon! In the name of God, I command you to leave this vessel, now! Back up, back up, back up. What the fuck? Is she okay? Shh. God, come on, Sarah. It's okay. You did great. Okay? Okay. You're gonna stop having those bad dreams. How you doing? Good. Good. Hey. Hey, guys. What you just saw was a successful deliverance, what most people refer to as exorcisms. That was Sarah and her husband Ian. Sarah was possessed by a demon, but we successfully exorcized the demon, and, I think that she's gonna be sleeping well from now on. So, great job, everybody. Oh, God. Jane? Yeah. Geoff? - Yeah. - Hi. Here you go. Back door's open. Just, if you meet anybody, don't tell 'em you got the keys from me. Just you're on a night walk, okay? Okay. Keep it quick. Be back here in an hour. - Got it. - Okay. - See you in an hour. - Okay, Jane. Thanks, Geoff. All right, everybody. We are here, finally. I think a lot of you know that I have been trying to get access to this building for a really long time. So, this is a pretty big deal. All right, we are here. We have the keys, and we are entering in through the side of the school. Here we go. We are in. It's chilly in here. The second floor. Amazing to finally see what this looks like on the inside. Okay. We are inside on the first floor. My goal is to plant a camera on this floor and then another one upstairs, and I'll come back and get them later. Okay, so now we are going to find a spot to plant this first camera. This looks like... Let's see. Oh, this looks like the front door, so I bet if we place the camera somewhere in view. Oh, that little spot might work actually. Let's see. Okay. Okay, there is our first hidden camera. We are now just heading into the old admin office. Oh, here's the names of some of the teachers that used to work here. There's a little, tiny door over here with some really messed up carpet. I'm just fucking with you. So, we will go up here to do what I've been really excited to do; check out the second floor. All right. So, now we will find a place to put the camera, the second camera. We have two stairwells. So, 50-50 shot of where we wanna aim it. I don't think putting it under the water fountain will work very well up here. This will actually probably work fine. So, turn it on. Okay. Okay. There we go. Yeah, looks pretty good. Whoa! It looks like everyone in Sacramento is asleep. Hopefully, if anyone's looking in right now, they don't think I'm a ghost. Okay, now we'll go check out the basement, which I think it's just a bunch of dirt and chairs, but we'll see what we can find. Geoff? This door was open when I was in here last. Geoff? Hello! I think, there's somebody in here right now. So, not exactly sure what that sound was, but I think I need to get the fuck out of here, because... Hello? Yep, rolling. Hi, Isabel? - Hello. Yeah. Randy? - Yes. - Nice to meet you. So, like I mentioned before, we have a camera crew. Oh. Oh! Hello. - This is Rob. - Hey. - Our camera guy. - Hi, Rob. - And this is Austin, our sound guy. Are we filming? - We are. - Oh. Okay. Come on in. There. You're all set. Okay. I don't normally deal with demons or kind of the darker side of things. It's more, you know I help people reconnect with their loved ones who have passed on, stuff like that. I do believe in the kind of darker side and that there are darker spirits. But not to the level that Wes seems to be involved. I think, you have to tread lightly, especially with... You know, if you're working on darker stuff. And I think that... That's all I'll say about that. Okay, you seem a bit... I don't wanna be rude. Obviously, we're not gonna put this in the film or wherever he wants to do it. You seem a bit reserved. I just... You know, obviously, I know I'm being recorded and I know that you're doing this with Wes. So, I'm just trying to be a little bit more judicious about what I'm saying. Are you gonna show him all of the stuff that I say? Probably not. I think Wes has a different style than I do. And I think, it can be misused. So, Wes doesn't know you're here? No. Don't worry, he's not gonna know that we're filming this. As I said, this is just for us. We're just curious. So, you're not gonna use this in the show? No. Well, then why are you filming it? For research. 'Cause as a producer, I need to know more about him as a person, because, you know these kinds of shows, they have a personality, and we're tryna humanize him more, because he just seems very over-the-top. And there's a lot of stuff like that out there. So, we wanna bring more to his character. If we know more about him, that's gonna help. Do you talk to him still? When was the last time you talked to him? It was a couple of years ago. A couple of years ago, I had to call him about a health thing relating to our mom, but other than that, I mean, we kind of had a little falling out, and so we haven't really talked. Do you do exorcisms? No. Does he? He has been known to do exorcisms. That was actually part of the contributing factor to our falling out. When was this? Three days ago. Oh. Did it... What happened? I mean, I don't wanna go into any details, but that... You know, the reason we're not talking is all of this stuff. So, this is some footage that somebody sent to me. This is the typical kind of thing I get where somebody wants me to analyze some... This is some security footage. You can see the door closing by itself. My job when I'm reviewing something like this is to see, first of all, if there is a practical explanation for this. Most people, something spooks them, and their mind immediately zips to something paranormal. And I know, that most of the time... You can see actually here, there's a spirit orb, and the stool gets knocked over. But I have to look at this and go, okay, are there open windows around? Is there a reason that the door would have closed by itself? Like, is there an AC unit that comes on in the night? And then after I look at the video and I can see, oh, actually there's legit reason to think that maybe there's something spiritual happening here, that's when I go and investigate. Did you see the orb? This is my, I call it the spirit satchel. Take this with me. I've got a book of demonology here. All demons are spirits, not all spirits are demons. These are the devices that I've... This is my haunting kit. We've got an EMF meter here. This is a spirit box that scans through radio frequencies. This is a recorder that anybody could pick up, although I've modified it a little bit to hear higher frequencies. And this is a, just a regular camera, although this does have an infrared setting, which is very important, because that allows you to see in the dark. Does your camera have an infrared setting by the way? Yeah, it does. It does. Yeah. Do you want to see it? - Yeah. - Yeah! Cool. So, it's the green type. It doesn't have the white type. Yeah! - Hi, Randy. - Hi. I know it doesn't look red, it looks green, but that is infrared. Allows you to see in the dark. A lot of ghost hunters use these, which they should. However, what I think that they get wrong is most ghost hunters get excited just when they get a hit. But the reality is that there are lots of things that emit electromagnetic frequency. So, getting a hit itself isn't the thing that's exciting. To me, what you're looking for is something that is disrupting the electromagnetic field that is present. This is a transmitter, right? - Yeah. - Does this... Here, let's see. So, you can see right there that a lot of people would go, "Oh my God, there's a ghost in your sound pack!" Obviously, that's not the case. What this does is... This just picks up radio frequencies. So, what you do... is you let it cycle through the radio frequencies, and you'll notice you'll pick up legit radio stations, things that you know, or DJs playing music, talk shows. But to me, this is an opportunity for spirits to actually try to make contact with us through this device. Hey, everyone. Wes Wheatley here. Welcome to the first episode of "Infrared". This is a paranormal investigation show, and right now we are on our way to investigate the paranormal activities that are taking place at Jay and Nicole's residence. They've been experiencing what sounds to me like an average haunt. I think, that the spirits don't mean them any harm, but they themselves are feeling very, very frightened right now, and we're gonna do a spiritual cleansing so that we can release the spirits from their residence and let them get back to feeling safe and secure. Okay. Here we are. We are at Jay and Nicole's residence right now. We're gonna be going in. We're gonna do a spiritual cleansing of the space, release the haunt, and let them get on with their lives. So, let's do it. They know we're filming? Uh... Yeah. Of course. So, I'm just gonna go in there and have a quick little pow-wow with them to let them know what to expect, and then we can all go in and film this first haunt. I'll come with you. No, no, no. That's okay. It's all right. I'll just be right back. Hey, how's it going? Jay. Hey man. Good to meet you. I'm Wes. All right, let's get this place cleansed. We'll get you and your wife feeling good. I've got a camera crew here with me, actually, that's gonna be filming the... No. - The cleansing. - No, no, no. We're not doing that. We're not doing cameras. We didn't agree to that. Little miscommunication. So, when I spoke to them earlier, they thought it was next week. Are you guys familiar with this? This is Lincoln School. This place gets talked about a lot. A lot of people who have tried to get into the space. A lot of people who've tried to sneak onto the grounds, and cops are called, and they're usually taken out. Nobody's really been able to... that I know of anyway, really infiltrate. Is this good? What do you think? Okay. Do you actually believe in this kind of stuff? Yeah, I do, very much. Really? Yeah. Did you always? I didn't when I was a kid. Actually, it's funny. When I was a kid, I grew up in a very religious house. I believed the idea of, like something, I believed in, God, and I believed in something different. Is your sister religious as well? Yeah. I don't really wanna talk about my sister in this, though. Why not? 'Cause she's not a part of it. We don't really have, you know, we don't work together anymore. So, she's not a part of this show. I'd rather just not have her be included. So, there's a lot of different rumors about, you know, like why this school closed down in the first place. You can imagine 12 years having been shut down, you hear a lot of different stuff. I think, the most popular rumor is that a teacher, I think, it was a seventh grade teacher, went crazy. Nobody really defined what crazy meant, but went crazy and like, murdered a classroom of students. An infestation of demon rats. This was something I read on Facebook, I think, like three years ago. So, do you know why actually closed? I do, yeah. It's not quite as exciting as demonic rats, but what actually happened is that there was a gas leak in a classroom, and a teacher and five students died. Since then, it's been totally shut down. Nobody's been allowed on the premises. And as far as I know, nobody's actually been able to go in, and there's no reports of any kind of hauntings or anything of that nature. But, I think, how can there not be? With a tragedy like that, the abandoned building. It is the perfect atmosphere for paranormal activity to be taking place. Yeah, I know, it was like maybe, I don't know, five or six years ago. And you still remember. Mm-hm. Yeah. So, do you wanna tell us about what's gonna happen here? Yes. We're doing a cleansing today. So, this woman, Judy, has contacted me because she has a spirit in the house. And so, I'm here to send the spirit, so that it can be at peace. - Cool. - So. Hello, Isabel. Hi, I'm Judy Perry. - Hi, Judy. Nice to meet you. - Hi, fellas. - Hi Yeah, we have this camera crew with us today. You said that's okay. - Yes, you mentioned that. I'm just gonna... I don't remember exactly what I told you about the circumstances around here, so, I'll just tell you everything. Okay. My husband, Skip, passed away six months, three weeks and two days ago. Okay. And since that happened, I've had several things that have been disconcerting to me. I mean, I think, probably most people. One thing that happened, and this has happened a couple of times. Skip used to get my coffee every morning. One morning I had had coffee, I took, let me go in here and show you. I had taken my empty coffee cup, set it right here, went into the bedroom to try and go to get dressed for the day. And when I came back out, I was gonna put it into the dishwasher. It was full and it was hot. It was steaming. I mean, that's a little hello, right? Mm-hm. We used to have a little deal. I would do the sorting of the laundry, and I would put it in the machine and wash it, and then he would take it out of the machine, put it into the dryer, dry it and fold it, put it away. He kinda got the raw deal, if you ask me. So, I had put the laundry in the washer, and it was late at night, and I thought, I'm just gonna go to sleep. I'll put it in the dryer in the morning. I came in here, and it was folded. It was folded. Oh. I feel something in this corner. You do? Mm-hm. Yeah. That's typical with kind of hotspots like this. Do you feel him? Do you feel a... I don't know what it is, but... Does it feel angry or sad? I'm not sure yet, but it's kind of confirming what you're saying, so. Oh. Wow! That's very exciting. I mean, I just love the idea that it is him, - Yeah. - And yet I don't want him to be unhappy. Right. - You know? - Yeah. There's this little voice, very high pitched, like a little baby, little baby voice under a pile of blankets. It's very muffled. It's like, "Help". "Help". Is that weird? It's like, baby Skip. You know, Judy, I totally understand why you would- You do? I mean, this is not... I wouldn't say it's normal for me, but it's... This is within the realm of standard. Oh. You know? It's so reassuring. So, what you're saying is that this... You're not necessarily feeling distressed. No. I mean, I do think it's Skip. So, it doesn't distress me. - Yeah. - I love him. But, I don't want him to be unhappy. - We wanna... - We want... To set him at peace. Yes. Go. Go with God, honey. Yep. My method, it'll probably take about 20 to 30 minutes. - That's fast. - Mm-hm. It is best, if the loved one is not in the room. Oh, you don't want me to here. It just allows the spirit to let go more easily. - Of course. - So, I'll just ask you to be in another room for the 20, 30 minutes. - I can. Okay. And then I'll just let you know, when it's done. So, I'm gonna go to my car get some equipment. So, if you just wanna, I don't know if there are any kind of things you want to say to Skip... - I've got some reading to do. To let him go. - Absolutely. - In peace. Absolutely. And then you can just go to the other room. - Okay. - I'll come back, and I'll set him free. I'm so relieved. Okay. I'm so relieved. I didn't know it would happen today, but thank you so much... - Yeah. - Isabel. - So, I'll just run to my car and grab some of my equipment. - Buh-bye. - Bye. Thank you. So, is this the only thing you do when you come to these cleansings? Not to the clients. I mean, what's nice about smudging is that it leaves a physical, like a smell, you know, that something's happened. So, it's like, it represents the spirit passing on. So. - Smells good. Yeah. I mean, I get a lot of calls from especially, it seems like a lot of widows. So, I don't know what's going on there, if it's like, you know, women having trouble letting go or something, But, you know, this does actually, I mean, it seems to help 'cause, you know, I haven't gotten any complaints. We'll just hit it in here. This is a nice touch, 'cause now her laundry will smell like sage, and it'll be like... But, 20 to 30 minutes is still fast, but a reasonable amount of time To set a spirit free. Hey, Rob, I'm gonna take this. It's Wes. Judy? Yes. Yes? Hi, Isabel. How did it go? Are you done? Yeah. - Okay. - All done. - Well. - So, you can come out. That was pretty quick, wasn't it? Yeah. - Well, that was easy, huh? - Yeah. Yeah. So, I will invoice you. Okay. Okay, great. I was gonna ask. Yep. So, I've got your contact info, and so you'll get that. - Okay. - Just in probably like 20 minutes. - In the email? - Yep. - Okay. All right. Okay, Isabel. Thank you so much. - I'm so, so thankful. - All right. Thanks, Judy. And you guys, thanks so much... Nice to meet you. Thank you. For your help today. - Thank you. - Yeah. Okay. All right. You have a good day. Thanks. You, too. Buh-bye. Thank you, Judy. We got all we need, right? Yeah. Wes said he has some news for us. Something to do with that school. Good or bad? Good, good. I think. I mean, he'd only call if he got it, right? We'll see what he says. So, I have this idea. I think, I can convince him, but if... Would you be open to joining the show? I think, I can win him over. First of all, I don't think he's gonna want that. I think he wants it. But, I also don't know, like, what would I be contributing? You know, like... Just keep him grounded, some sort of human element. I don't think, I don't think I'm gonna keep him grounded. I think you can. I don't think he's gonna listen to me. I think it's worth a shot. Worst thing he can do is tell you to leave. I mean, you've been tryna fix that relationship with him. Yeah. I mean, I don't... So, the point of this show is... To hunt ghosts. But is it to help him? Like, is it going to end up helping him? I think it will help him. And it's helping people. I think, he wants to help people, honestly. I don't know if he's doing it the right way. But I think, truly, that's what he wants to do. It's just been a long time since I've talked to him, you know. I did not think that this is how this day was gonna go. All right! Very exciting news, everybody! We've gotten permission to go to Lincoln School. It is an enormous abandoned building, been abandoned for years, and I've always wanted to go and do a spiritual investigation there, and we got permission to go to that school. It took some aggressively charismatic emails, but we did it. And we're going and that's our next haunt. Super excited! - We're good. - Good. All right! Great job. So, the other day, when you were doing your exorcism, deliverance or wherever it was, she mentioned that you killed someone. What was that about? During exorcisms, actually, demons will say a lot of things to try to provoke everybody. So, it was nothing. It seemed like you knew what she was talking about. What I... If you saw a recognition, it was that I recognized that this possession was legit and, it needed to be expedited. So, yeah. Not gonna give us anything else? I'd give you something if there was more to give you. Geoff! - Wes! Hey, welcome. - So good to meet you. Thank you so much! Yes, I'm Geoff. I'm also known as the owner's manual. - The owner's manual! - Yeah! Hey, I'm so... - That's great. - Come on in, guys. Oh, yeah. I'm so sorry. This is the crew. This is my producer, Randy. - Producer. Never met a producer before. This is great. - Here he is. This is Austin. He's our sound guy. Hey, Austin. How are you? And behind the camera, that's Rob. You know what? I'm so excited for you guys to meet her. Meet her? You know, this place, it does need a facelift, but to me it's the happiest place on earth. - She. Oh, the building is her. - Yeah. - Of course. - Great. So anyway, let's get rolling. I have a few other engagements today, but I'm very happy to give you a tour and show you all the things we have to offer here. Oh, I'm sorry. This is a closed... Is this... This is my sister, Isabel. [Geoff Oh, it's your sister, Isabel. Okay. Well, who else is gonna show up? That's a great... That's a great question! I'm Geoff. I'm the owner's manual. I'm the owner. And we have a beautiful tour. I'm ready to show you guys. But we gotta get moving. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course. Believe it or not, I own more than one property. So, there's a lot of history to this place. Great, great. Randy, let me talk to you for a second. No, let's keep going. Because, I guess, he's busy. I understand that he's busy, but I just want to have a quick word with you. Really fast. So, you can cut. I'm sorry, just a show thing... Is everything okay? Talk about the framing here for a second. We are in view. Did you do this? This building is the show. I'm trying to be as lenient as I can here... - This is my show! - She's gonna help. There's a time issue. Absolutely. Yeah, Geoff. I just don't want to cut your tour short. You know, so. Yep. No, no, everything's great. Everything's great. Yeah, I'd rather spend time inside than out here... - Yeah, me too. - Even though the whole place is beautiful. But, after you. Yeah. You're still recording? Great. Yeah, I'm gonna turn the light on. There we go. This... I think that looks better. Let's do it that way. So, basically he's just gonna do an intro to the episode. He's gonna talk to you about the building. Just give us a tour. Okay. Is this gonna be at the beginning of the movie or at the end of the movie? This is the opening to the show. Yeah. - Show? Okay. Yeah. We're gonna give 'em a show. We're gonna give 'em a show. Let's do it. Hey, everybody, it's Wes Wheatley here. Welcome to another episode of "Infrared". I'm here with Geoff, the owner of the Lincoln School, which you've seen or heard so much about. Oh, this is adorable. Is this a... - You know, - An original... This supposedly, after midnight, serves fruit punch. Well then, we're in luck. Just fruit punch. Great, nothing but fruit punch here, - Till 8 am. - And water. Freshly brewed. Yeah, water. Cool. All original, all authentic. Great. Just like this whole building. Terrific. And we'll get a sponsorship from fruit punch. So, then the classrooms, they all kind of have their own story. This used to be the vice-principal's spot, but then it was taken over by Miss Schultz. Miss Schultz was a fascinating English teacher. She shared a lot of stories- - Can we go in? Of course. Thank you. Miss Schultz was... It was not the vice-principal but took over from the vice-principal. Yeah, she was an English teacher. She would share stories of Germany and her time there. These quotes are scattered and written throughout. I always wondered what some of these things meant, but you might be able to detect more. Wait, when were these written? These notes? Ah, they've come from all different times. I mean, hey, time is a big question mark, right? I want to kind of give you guys a basic feel. Now, there was the security guard did talk about this corridor here. When he would do is his night watch, he'd hear laughter. In this corridor? In this corridor, and a lot of times that would come from either bringing in... There was like a puppy in here, he would hear laughter. There was a child, he would hear laughter. So... - Interesting. Just patterns of sound that pass through here, but this was a spot he would talk about that he would hear things. Just for the... So we have it, can you just show us upstairs as well, maybe more of the building? Hey, you gotta love your producer. He's always thinking up! Right? He sure is always thinking. This is gonna be a great movie! I have a great feeling! Yeah, yeah. He's worth every penny! The higher up we go, the more interesting it gets. Interest rises, right? Look at this! This is the happiest day of his life. That's what I do. I make people happy. So, there was an art class in here. A painter from Spain would come through. The light comes in at very interesting angles. He used to say that the sun burn was starting to kind of fry that part of the ceiling, so the ceiling's starting to come down. Interesting. He said that was burn? I mean, the stories people come up with. We all kind of make up our own reality. That thing is bizarre. Apparently, it's turned on on its own. Oh, interesting. And even though that outlet doesn't work, - It doesn't? - So, I don't know. Yeah. Is there electricity in the building at all? No, not right now. So, the exit signs, they must be on a back-up service? Hey. Or on a generator. Maybe it's just a spirit. Or maybe they are haunted, right? Dr. Kenneth, when he was here, he would teach psychology. And he would walk into his classroom early in the morning. Nobody had been in here, and he would just smell traces of smoke, cigarette smoke. I don't think the doctor did these. He's not really into ballerinas. But, It's helped, you know. Again, there's codes here. It's almost like you're... You know, you go to, what are those things called? Escape rooms or something? - Yeah. - It's like that might be a code word, that might be nothing. You know, how you could grab this here and write, Mr. Geoff versus Wes, the hero. Wes, the hero. You see what he's doing? He's scoping everything out. That's the kind of person you need in your life. Yeah, that's why I've got him. He sees the big picture. That's where things happen. That's right. He knows how to sculpt a narrative. It may not be Hearst Castle, but it's got character. One time this guy came in, and he's like, "Wait, I feel really dizzy when I walked in." It's like, well, no shit, you had like two drinks before you came here, you know? So, I always like to just see through the nonsense. But, again, I'm open-minded. I just haven't seen anything that's convinced me. Sure. In these... Not to diminish your efforts, but, Hopefully you find something that's concrete. Yeah, yeah, for maybe... I want this movie to be good. Yeah, the show. The show is gonna be a hit. Okay. Before you go, if you could, for the camera... There's been a lot of rumors. Right? About why the place closed down. And I would love to get you telling the camera the real story of... You want me to be the movie star. Okay. Yeah, yeah. You're gonna be the star of this episode. Let's all get closer. Let's get a... - How's that look? A quick snap. Yep. So, the school, again, it's... Oh, wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry. So, I'm gonna intro it, and then I'll throw it to you. Hey, everyone, Wes Wheatley here. Welcome back to "Infrared". We're here with Geoff, the owner's manual of Lincoln School. And he's about to put those rumors to sleep. Anyone who's been on the Facebook group page, we've all heard a lot of crazy things. So, Geoff. I'm a little nervous, I don't do this often. Yeah, why did it get abandoned? I'm not into the whole whatever it's called, the Facebook, I just like to tell the cold, hard truth. This is an amazing place, it's an inspiring place, a lot of great stuff has happened here. Unfortunately, the school closed down. There was a terrible, terrible tragedy, and it happened in the lower level classrooms. There was a teacher, and five students, and there was a gas leak, and they were like, they were trapped. It's hard for me to talk about it. Yeah. So, it was like, did you say the lower level classrooms? I had read that it took place in the basement. There's all kinds of stories that people tell, but it was the lower level. And it was a horrible tragedy. And I still try to- Would you be able to say it one more time and just say that it was the basement, say that it happened in the basement? So, yeah, it closed the school down, And my wife, she's an amazing teacher as well. We want this place to come back to life, because we can't live in the past. We want to live in the future, and we go to these groups, and we talk about moving forward. And one of the theories is you know, you gotta forge ahead, and you gotta kick ass, and you gotta move forward. We're trying to come back bigger and better. And that's... Did your wife work here also? She taught here, yeah. She taught here. She did? She was a teacher here? She was a teacher here. Well, not like right there. What did she teach? Oh, she's a... Oh my God, she's just the most amazing music teacher. Wow! - I mean... - Does she still teach? She's so great, she almost taught me how to play one note of guitar. She got me to play "The Twilight Zone". That's all I could learn how to play. Oh, wow. She's a very passionate music teacher. Did she teach all different levels of music? - I mean, - Yeah. Like, Kindergarten to on up. She can do everything, yeah. She's brilliant. But anyway, I'm kind of taking over your show here. No, no, no. Sorry, but I'll... You're doing such an awesome job. In fact, if we could, what would be terrific would be if we could actually get access to the basement, because, I'm not sure if you know this, but for the show, it's true that the point of a trauma or a tragedy fosters the most vulnerable space for spiritual activity. - So... - Well, last I know, it's a storage unit. It's got a bunch of junk in there from when the school closed. So, it's not like anything like this, you know, but... No, no, no. And this is great. I cannot wait to... I mean, trust me, we're gonna... Every inch of this place, we're gonna get to it. You know, I gotta run. If you really want to, one of these I think, will get you in there. Into the basement? I can't make any promises. I don't know it's... But anyway, I gotta run. Yeah, yeah. Hey, I wish you guys all the success in the world. Thank you so much. We really, really appreciate this. I'll be around. So, make yourselves at home. Okay. And, you know, let me know if you need anything. Great. Be safe. Yeah. Thank you so much. Did you know she was gonna be here? You did? Yeah. Did he tell you? I mean, how did you know? We... I mean, you're gonna find out. We shot with her the other day. Randy thought that... You shot with her the other day? Randy didn't feel the show was as dynamic as it could be, and... Are you recording all this? To use an old saying, y'know, get the band back together. I mean, like, would it not be nice to hang out with your sister, again? - No. No, it would not be nice. Otherwise, I'd have her here. She is here. I would have invited her here, I mean. I'm gonna go get some B-roll. Okay? Sure. Make some good music with the old band. All right. So, it'd really help if you stayed. How is it? I don't know how it's helping. I'm not, I'm not helping. I'm not helping by being here. He doesn't want me to be here. I don't wanna be here. - It's gonna help him. - How? What does that-Oh my God. How you doing guys? B-roll? Some B-roll for the, yep. So, can you tell us about what you're doing right now? Right now, I'm setting up a camera that has infrared capacity to film this hallway. Cool. Okay. So, what we're gonna do? We're gonna do an intro with you and Isabel. So, we're gonna go get her now. Wait, what are you talking about? We're gonna do an intro with me and Isabel. This is my show. You want a good show? This is what I do. But what we're doing a show in the building right now. We can do the intro, with you two in the building. - What the fuck? - Double the ratings. Let's do this. You're gonna love it. Trust me. Trust me, I do this for a living. I got you off Craigslist. You do this for a living. Sure, bring her up. Take it away, Wes. Give me an action. Action! Hey everybody. It's Wes Wheatley here and, Izzy Wheatley. And we're here at the Lincoln School where we are looking to... Let's... That sucks. Hey everybody, it's Wes Wheatley here. You don't need to do that again. I'll just fucking do it. Just let me roll into it. Hey everybody. Hey everyone. Hey everyone, Wes Wheatley here and... Izzy Wheatley. And we're here at Lincoln School, which has been such a dream come true, being able to get into this facility. I've wanted to get in here for the last 10 years. And here we are. What about if you two do it together? If you Izzy, you start and you just explain to the camera together. And this is an infrared camera. That Wes set up. Wes, do you wanna... That's what it is... - Say some more about it - It's an infrared camera that I set up. Oh man. Randy, did you talk to him? I haven't had a chance yet, but I'm gonna talk to him. This isn't working. Randy, it's not helping. I'm not helping. You said I was coming to help. How is this helping? How? He needs more confidence. I think, you can give him that confidence. It's not, I can't do it. I'm not. How am I gonna give him confidence. He needs your acceptance. I think he's just lacking something that I cannot give. I think, you can help. I mean, if... He doesn't wanna talk to me. He hasn't wanted to talk to me for two years. You wanna help him, right? Yeah. Do you have to do that now? What will help him is, is if the show will work, 'cause it's not working at the moment, right? We want it to work as well. Let's work together. Let's make this happen. I mean, I'll try talking to him. I don't think he'll talk to me. Please. Thank you. Why did you decide to come, by the way? Because, Randy said that I would help. He said that you would help, with the show? Yeah... - Like, a crew member. - You would want me here and that I would help. Help doing what? I don't know. I mean, that's why I told him, I was gonna leave. Are you gonna leave? I mean, I will, if you want me to. You might as well leave because, this show is a sinking ship. You drive me fucking crazy. But, you are really good at this stuff. You do not... - I do. - Think that. I do. - You never thought that. I do, You've been doing this since we were like, I mean, like, you were like six years old and you were like, "The Wes Wheatley Show". This has been your dream forever. And now we're finally here. You made it to the Lincoln School, which nobody has been able to get into. And you did that. You're here for a reason. But the show is going terribly. I was the first one to get in here and now I could fuck it up. - But it's your own show. - Great! You've never done this before. So, of course you're not gonna be like, you gotta figure it out, but you were made to do this Wes. You might... Drive me crazy, but that's true. I thought the camera would be on and it'd be like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Like when I was a kid. Do you remember your motto? "I'm Wes Wheatley and I can't lose". Well, it hasn't felt like that. Well... Let's get back in there. You're gonna... Do you wanna stick around? You wanna be part of the "Wes Wheatley Can't Lose Show"? Let's just get in there and do the show. I'll do that. If you admit, you feel something in here. Isabel, don't fuck around with me. It's drafty. It's an old drafty school. That's true. Well, let's get down to the fucking drafty basement and find some God damn ghosts. Hey everybody. Welcome back to "Infrared". I'm Wes Wheatley and I'm here with... Izzy Wheatley. Izzy Wheatley, how about some pep? One more time. Action. Hey everybody, welcome back to "Infrared". I'm Wes Wheatley and I'm here with... Izzy Wheatley. And we are here at the basement door. So, let's go inside. You might recall, but this is the location where the gas leak took place that actually saw the building condemned, where a teacher and five students were killed, making this the most vulnerable place in the building for spiritual activities. These keys don't work. I need you to call Geoff and tell him that the basement key isn't here. Just tell him to bring all of the building keys down so that one of the keys would, can you do that? Thank you. Okay. Okay. Back upstairs. Flashlights up. All right. Ready? Welcome back, to "Infrared". Infrared. Say it with me, Welcome back to "Infrared". We'll work on that. I've got my EMF meter and what we're doing currently is we're gonna be roaming the dark hallways of Lincoln School here. And we're gonna be using this EMF meter as our trusty guide to see where we can start to pick up on some electromagnetic frequencies. It smells in here. Yeah! Is that a quite common thing? It is. With spirits. It's a common thing in an old abandoned location. I think, this is the location. The room where he mentioned that there's a security guard that comes around that sometimes smells cigarette smoke. - Oh yeah, like, smoke. Yeah. I think, that this is probably nothing, but let's bear the name Hannah in mind. Okay. So, Izzy do you know how to use an EMF meter? You just hold it. That's true. - Right? - Yeah. Although, Izzy's job is not using the EMF meter because anyone can do that. Izzy's job is to trust her intuition, because, Izzy is intuitively far more sensitive to the spirit realm than any of the instruments that I have. Izzy, in fact, is the reason... - Let's go upstairs. Izzy is the reason that I started doing this in the first place. Shh. Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa. All right. We're getting some interesting activity up here. Let's see, if it get stronger as we move up. Okay. Very interesting fluctuations right now. Whoa, whoa, whoa, twenty. Getting really high numbers right now. Okay. Come on. Okay. Okay. Oh my God! That sounded like a locker. Okay. This is the most fractured signal I've ever seen. Look at that. Look at those fucking numbers. Holy shit! Holy shit! Okay. Guys? Izzy, Izzy, what is it? Izzy, okay, okay. Let me turn this off. Talk to me. What are you feeling? Izzy, what are you feeling? Huh? It's here. Where, where, where? Where? Show me. Izzy, stay with it. Show me. Come on. It's okay, it's okay. You're okay. Stay open. Where's the spot? Show me where it is It's right here. Right here? Yeah? Okay. Okay, so... We're gonna get set up here. If there are any spirits present in this room, we invite you to communicate with us. If there are any spirits in this room now, we invite you to communicate with us. Izzy. I can't do it. Huh? I can't do it. What are you talking about? I can't do it. Hey, Izzy. Hey, are you getting something? Are you getting something? Can we stop please? Izzy, no, no, no. Hey, it's okay. I wanna stop, please. Izzy, please, please, please. Hey I'm sorry but.. What, what, what? Look, Izzy, Izzy, Izzy. Oh my God! What is wrong with... It's not working.. Rob, Rob, what the fuck are you guys doing? I'm not going back in there. That was so dark. You don't know, you didn't feel it. That's true. I know. Listen, I know. I understand. You're the one with the gift. Okay. And it is a gift. Which is why I need you. This is what you do, you like using other people for your entertainment. - That's not true. That's what you did with that guy. That's why he died. What happened with that guy, I felt fucking terrible about, all right. I was naive. I didn't know what I was doing. No, this is exactly what you like to do. You like to stir shit up. You stir up all this dark. That's exactly what the show is all about. It's not. Listen, you completely misunderstand my interests. Okay? The show is not about trying to stir any darkness out. My interest has always been, always been trying to find out how to be able to set that dark realm free. That's true. And from what I have seen, the way that you do that is by acknowledging them. Let them be seen. But I cannot do that on my own. I need you. So, can we please, Izzy, please, please. Will you please go back in there with me and help me find a way to give this place some peace. You felt that. Okay. Come on. Come on. - Just give me a second. Alright. Hey guys, break's over. We're gonna go back in, okay. Can we ask you a few questions? If you're okay with it? About what? What happened up there? Sometimes... Sometimes I'm able to feel, spirits. The dark ones are... It's really hard. They're really... There's just a lot of pain and fear and it's uh it's just overwhelming. Was the one up there... bad? You didn't feel anything, Wes? Not like that. I mean, I sometimes, there's a little something, but it's nothing like... Izzy's got a gift. That was the biggest reaction, I've seen. I've seen her react. When we were young, it was a... Yeah. We didn't know what was going on, but that was a big one. I think, this is a troubled space. What happened two years ago, was it something like this? I don't wanna talk about that. Okay. If you feel uncomfortable, that's fine. Thank you Izzy, for talking to us. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hey, Austin is your sound equipment okay? Yeah we're good. You said, it got fucked up or something? Yeah, we had some interference, but I checked it all out, we're good to go. Okay, great, great, great. Are you recording? - Recording. - Okay. So, here we are at the camera that I set up in the hallway. Battery is dead. So, I'm just gonna do a quick battery change here. And, once I get it on, I'm gonna scrub through some of the footage to see if anything occurred during the time that we were in there. So, I'm just gonna jump to the approximate time that we had that activity in the other room. I'm looking for... Holy shit, Izzy, come here. Look, look, look, did you see that orb? Did you see that? Rob, did you see that orb? Yeah. Holy shit! Oh my God! That was this door. We were in that room and a door slammed, right? But that slammed. Now, this is a different door. Izzy, Izzy, come here, come here. Is your infrared on? I can turn it on. Turn on the infrared. Okay. Rob, I need you while you're looking at it. Right? You're also scanning for orbs. You saw that orb on the camera, right? - Yeah. - That's the kind of thing that you're looking for. Izzy, how are you feeling? Rob, scan this room. See, if you can see anything. Okay. Izzy, do you feel anything? No. No? What the fuck. Okay. Rob, with your infrared, I need you scanning, looking for... anything out of the ordinary, but there's these kinds of orbs. That's really what you're looking for here. Izzy, here. Let's also walk around, okay? You're our barometer. What do we do if we find an orb? If you find an orb, you let me know exactly where you saw it. Izzy, are you getting anything? I don't know. Relax into it. Wait, what? - I don't feel anything. Wes? What is it? I don't know. It looks like a camera. Is this one of ours? Nope. It's not one of mine. Does it have a card in it? Yeah. What the fuck is it doing here? Who would've done that? It must be Geoff's right? He's the only one who's in here. Why would Geoff put a camera there? He's watching us. Where was it? Up here? Yeah, it was right here. It was right here, it was pointing right over there. It was pointed right here where all of the main activity happened. Right? Can we do a quick scan? Let's use your camera light here, and do a quick scan to see if we find any more of these cameras. 'Cause, if Geoff is watching us, I wanna know why? Hey everybody, we're downstairs now. And, we found another one of these cameras sitting here, hidden down on this outlet. And it's pointing at the entrance of the building. We're gonna pop the card reader out and we're gonna take a look at what's on this and the other camera and see if there's anything interesting. A woman turned on this little camera and she set it up and she positioned it on that ledge. And this is what the camera's filming. What it is that she's doing? Why she set up the camera? Where she is in the buil... Oh, there she is. So, this is the area where those lockers are. So, this is the space where everything happened, when we were up there. Okay, looks like she's coming now. There she is. Oh! What the fuck? Holy shit! That was it. What? That was it. That was it? Yeah. That had to be it. That had to be it, what I felt. That's Geoff. Is that Geoff? Oh, shit! Okay. I'm gonna put on the other card. I mean, we're the only ones allowed in here, right? Yeah. I mean, he... Yeah, that's right. Geoff said nobody else, nobody else comes in here. Right? He said, nobody else is coming in here. We're scrubbing through, this is the lower level. But, why was she setting up cameras? I don't know. I mean, that's the question. Is she trying to... Is she looking for ghosts? Is she looking for him? Fuck! Oh my God! Geoff, what the fuck are you goddamn doing? Wes, we have to call the police. No, no, no, no police. - What? - We have to call the police What? We call the police, we're gonna lose the show... Who gives a shit about the show? Whoa, whoa, Randy, she is right. We are absolutely going to be calling the police. And we're gonna be turning over this, we're gonna be turning over all of the footage that we have. This is a fucking crime scene man. Okay? But, Izzy, it's also true that if we call the police right now, they're gonna come, they're gonna lock up the building, and all of the darkness that exists in here right now, it's gonna stay. Whatever happened 12 years ago, whatever bad shit happened just now, it's gonna keep on happening. Wes, I have never Felt anything this strong. Like, not even two years ago, that was like nothing compared to this. I think we just call the police. Izzy, I'm afraid, that if we don't do something now, nobody's going to. Nobody's done anything for the last 12 years. And once the police find out about whatever it is, that's been happening in here. We don't even know where it is. We know where it is. It's in the fucking basement. That's why he didn't want us down there. Did you get a hold of Geoff with the key? - Not yet. - I don't think, we wanna be talking to Geoff. I was just curious, if he came by with it. I can just pick the lock. If you guys want. You can pick locks? Yeah. You can pick that lock? I think so. Okay, then we pick the lock. We film it, and we cleanse this space, and then we turn everything over to the cops. Got it. Okay. Do you feel it? Yeah. Yeah? It's here. Okay. Open it! Fuck! Come on Wes? Shit! Wes. Yeah. It's this way. Okay. It's okay. Okay. It's here. In here? Can you shine your light in there? You have to go in there. We have to go in there? Yeah. Okay. Okay, okay. Izzy, you're doing great, you're doing great. Okay, we find the spot. It's right here. - Is this it? - Yeah. Okay. - Go, go, go. - Okay. Okay. Spirit, we summon you to commune with us in this space. Spirit, we invite you... - Wes... - We invite you to communicate with us in this space. Okay, okay. Alright, let's go, let's go. Izzy, Izzy. Turn it off. Turn it off, okay. Turn it off, okay. Okay? Are you okay? - Okay. - All right, let's go. Where's Randy? Hold on, hold on... Randy? Randy, come on we gotta go. Where is he? Randy! Randy! We gotta go. Fuck, Rob, come on. Randy? Fuck, is he really gone? - Randy! - We gotta go. Go, go, go. Fuck! I think, it's in here. Go back. - Come on, come on. Shit. This door is unlocked. It's not fucking working. Let me try. Fuck this. Where are you going? There's nothing here. Guys? - Rob. - Shit! Go, go. Run, run. Let's go. She's behind us, just go! Rob, what did you see? Hold the door. Hold the fucking door! Okay, okay. Let light rise, out of darkness! Let light rise, out of darkness! Let light rise, out of darkness! Demon I banish you! Let light rise out of darkness! I banish you! Let light rise out of darkness. Okay, let's go. Let's go, let's go. Shut up! Holy shit! Geoff, what the fuck? What did I tell... Hey, don't play games. I'm not playing games... Don't play games with me. What did I tell you? - I swear to God, I'm not playing games... - What did I tell you, there was nothing down here. What did you do? You disrespected me, I'm the owner's manual, I let you in here! Geoff, I'm so sorry. I did not mean to disrespect... - What were you doing in there? You know what, You made a mockery of me. You wanted to show, you brought these clowns in here to make a fucking show. - I don't know... - You better fucking keep recording, 'cause we got a show coming. You wanted show, you got it. But, I'm the fucking producer this time. Alright? I'm the producer. It's my show! - You're the producer. - I'm the producer. Why aren't you fucking recording me? - You're the producer... - You fucking asshole. I saw your attitude when you walked in here, you were making fun of me. Geoff, Geoff! I own you guys now! Geoff, just tell us, what you need, man. Just tell us what you need. We'll do whatever you want. You wanted a show, that's what we're gonna do. Get fucking moving, right now. - Okay. - Get moving. - Okay. - Alright? 15 minutes of shame starts right now. - You're the producer, man... - Yeah, I'm ready for my close-up. I've been ready for my close-up. Let's go. Wes, you're no hero. You're a fucking coward. You're a fake hero. You're a false idol. You're you're right, man. You're just one big Facebook group. That's what I hate about Facebook. You're right, man. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. Oh, hey. In here. Where do you think you're going? You're driving around my place. You all act like, you own the place What am I? - You know, you're right. We're trying to follow your direction... Isabel, this is just ridiculous. Okay. Geoff, whatever you want... Hey, right through there, come on. - It's beautiful, come on. - No! It's a great sound stage. Let's go. It's the scene of the crime. Hey Isabel, come on. You wanted show, what's your... Come on, Isabel. Hey, come on, come on. Just move the light on here. Let's help the sound guy. Hey, is the sound okay? Yeah, it's fine. - Okay, great. - Fuck! So, Isabel, come on, come on. Let's save this for the show. You're giving away all your emotion. Like, you gotta teach these guys everything. - Come on, cameraman, come on... - Geoff, man, you don't have to do this. This is going way too slow. - Geoff man you don't... - too fucking slow! You don't have to do this, okay. Whatever you... No. We've got a show to do. - Okay. - Okay, enough bullshitting. Let's slate. Come on, stop stuttering. What the fuck's your problem? You're up there, you're asking about the basement. Oh my God! You're a big show off. When the camera's on, you don't know how to shine, that's the problem. Geoff, I'm ready. I'll do the show, man. - Okay. - Okay. - Ready? - Yes, yes. And, action. Okay. Hey everyone this is Wes Wheatley here. Welcome back to "Infrared". We're here... What did you see? What did you find? What are you doing here? Alright, We're here, at the Lincoln School. And, who introduced you here? We're here with Geoff, who introduced us... - Yeah! To the school. He brought us down here for the show. And, so now, we're down here. We're doing this show and Geoff is... Oh man! Geoff is here with us. Cut, hold a sec. Yeah, man. Geoff is here with... Hey, stop moving around, you're like a ballerina. - I'm so sorry. Okay.

Remember, you kept asking the basement, what happened? You were so interested... - Yeah, yeah. This tragedy and my wife, you know what, this is where it happened. This is where the gas leak happened. He's gonna kill us. You see, that's the sign of a great show is you start with the emotion, you end with it. You bookend it, you fucking bookend it. You get the setup and the payoff. - Yes! - That's right. Yes, Geoff- - And now, you are gonna be part of the most beautiful finale you've ever seen. No... Infrared is a fucking joke, compared to what this is gonna be. You're right. - Okay? - Yeah. You're right. Why did you fucking move? What are you shooting? Dirt? Let's get this over here. Let's get us in a three shot. Come on. The new star, the movie stars. All =right, yeah man. One final frame. - This is it... - This is gonna be incredible. This is kind of tight.
