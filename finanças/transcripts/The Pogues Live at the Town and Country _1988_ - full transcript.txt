The last time I saw you was down at the Greeks There was whiskey on Sunday and tears on our cheeks You sang me a song that was pure as the breeze On a road leading up Glenaveigh I sat for a while at the cross at Finnoe Where young lovers would meet when the flowers were in bloom Heard the men coming home from the fair at Shinrone Their hearts in Tipperary wherever they go Take my hand and dry your tears, babe Take my hand, forget your fears, babe There's no pain, there's no more sorrow They're all gone, gone in the years, babe I sat for a while by the gap in the wall Found a rusty tin can and an old hurley ball Heard the cards being dealt and the rosary called And a fiddle playing "Sean Dun Na Ngall" And the next time I see you we'll be down at the Greeks There'll be whiskey on Sunday and tears on our cheeks For it's useless to laugh and it's stupid to bawl 'bout a rusty tin can and an old hurley ball Take my hand and dry your tears, babe Take my hand, forget your fears, babe There's no pain, there's no more sorrow They're all gone, gone in the years, babe So I walked as the day was dawning Where small birds sang and leaves were falling Where we once watched the row boats landing By the broad majestic Shannon If I should fall from grace with God Where no doctor can relieve me If I'm buried in the sod But the angels won't receive me Let me go, boys, let me go, boys Let me go down in the mud, where the rivers all run dry This land was always ours It was the proud land of our fathers It belongs to us and them Not to any of the others Let them go, boys, let them go, boys Let them go down in the mud, where the rivers all run dry Bury me at sea Where no murdered ghost can haunt me If I rock upon the waves And no corpse can lie upon me Let me go, boys, let me go, boys Let me go down in the mud, where the rivers all run dry If I should fall from grace with God Where no doctor can relieve me If I'm buried in the sand But the angels won't receive me Let me go, boys, let me go, boys Let me go down in the mud, where the rivers all run dry I've been loving you a long time Down all the years, down all the days And I've cried for all your troubles Smiled at your funny little ways We watched our friends grow up together And we saw them as they fell Some of them fell into Heaven Some of them fell into Hell I took shelter from a shower And I stepped into your arms On a rainy night in Soho The wind was whistling all its charms I sang you all my sorrows You told me all your joys Whatever happened to that old song? To all those little girls and boys Now the song is nearly over We may never find out what it means Still there's a light I hold before me You're the measure of my dreams The measure of my dreams Sometimes I'd wake up in the morning The ginger lady by my bed Covered in a cloak of silence I'd hear you talking in my head I'm not singing for the future I'm not dreaming of the past I'm not speaking of the first times I never think about the last Now the song is nearly over We may never find out what it means Still there's a light I hold before me You're the measure of my dreams The measure of my dreams The island, it is silent now But the ghosts still haunt the waves And the torch lights up a famished man Who fortune could not save Did you work upon the railway? Did you rid the streets of crime? Were your dollars from the White House? Were they from the Five-and-Dime? Did the old songs taunt or cheer you? And did they still make you cry? Did you count the months and years Or did your teardrops quickly dry? "Ah, no", says he, "it was not to be on a coffin ship I came here and I never even got so far that they could change my name" Thousands are sailing Across the western ocean To a land of opportunity That some of them will never see Fortune prevailing Across the western ocean Their bellies full Their spirits free They'll break the chains of poverty And they'll dance In Manhattan's desert twilight In the death of afternoon We stepped hand in hand on Broadway Like the first man on the moon And a blackbird broke the silence As you whistled it so sweet And in Brendan Behan's footsteps I danced up and down the street Then we said goodnight to Broadway Giving it our best regards Tipped our hats to Mister Cohen Dear old Times Square's favourite bard Then we raised a glass to JFK And a dozen more besides When I got back to my empty room I suppose I must have cried Thousands are sailing Again across the ocean Where the hand of opportunity Draws tickets in a lottery Postcards we're mailing Of sky light skies and oceans From rooms the daylight never sees And lights don't glow on Christmas trees Thousands are sailing Again across the ocean Where the hand of opportunity Draws tickets in a lottery Postcards we're mailing Of sky light skies and oceans From rooms the daylight never sees And lights don't glow on Christmas trees Still we dance to the music And we dance It was Christmas Eve, babe In the drunk tank An old man said to me "Won't see another one" And then he sang a song 'The Rare Old Mountain Dew' I turned my face away And dreamed about you Got on a lucky one Came in eighteen-to-one I've got a feeling This year's for me and you So, Happy Christmas I love you, baby I can see a better time When all our dreams come true They've got cars big as bars, they've got rivers of gold But the wind goes right through you, it's no place for the old When you first took my hand on a cold Christmas Eve You promised me Broadway was waiting for me You were handsome! You were pretty, Queen of New York City When the band finished playing They howled out for more Sinatra was swinging, all the drunks, they were singing We kissed on a corner Then danced through the night The boys of the NYPD choir Were singing, "Galway Bay" And the bells were ringing out For Christmas day You're a bum, you're a punk, You're an old slut on junk, Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed You scumbag, you maggot, you cheap, lousy faggot Happy Christmas, your arse I pray God it's our last The boys of the NYPD choir Still singing, "Galway Bay" And the bells are ringing out For Christmas day "I could have been someone" Well, so could anyone You took my dreams from me When I first found you I kept them with me, babe I put them with my own Can't make it all alone I've built my dreams around you The boys of the NYPD choir Still singing, "Galway Bay" And the bells are ringing out For Christmas day As I walked down by the riverside One evening in the spring Heard a long gone song From days gone by Blown in on the great North wind. Though there is no lonesome corncrake's cry Or sorrow and delight You can hear the cars And the shouts from bars And the laughter and the fights. May the ghosts that howled Round the house at night Never keep you from your sleep May they all sleep tight Down in hell tonight Or where ever they may be. As I walked on with a heavy heart Then a stone danced on the tide And the song went on Though the lights were gone And the North wind gently sighed And an evening breeze coming from the east That kissed the riverside So I pray now child that you sleep tonight When you hear this lullaby. May the wind that blows from haunted graves Never bring you misery May the angels bright Watch you tonight And keep you while you sleep. I met my love by the gas works wall Dreamed a dream by the old canal I kissed my girl by the factory wall Dirty old town Dirty old town Clouds are drifting across the moon Cats are prowling on their beat Spring's a girl from the streets at night Dirty old town Dirty old town I heard a siren from the docks Saw a train set the night on fire I smelled the spring on the smoky wind Dirty old town Dirty old town I'm gonna make me a good sharp axe Shining steel tempered in the fire I'll chop you down like an old dead tree Dirty old town Dirty old town Dirty old town Dirty old town Dirty old town Dirty old town London calling to the faraway towns Now war is declared and battle come down London calling to the underworld Come out of the cupboard, you boys and girls London calling, now don't look to us Phony Beatlemania has bitten the dust London calling, see we ain't got no swing Except for the ring of the truncheon thing The ice age is coming, the sun's zooming in Meltdown expected, the wheat is growing thin Engines stop running, but I have no fear 'Cause London is drowning I live by the river London calling to the imitation zone Forget it, brother, you can go it alone London calling to the zombies of death Quit holding out and draw another breath London calling and I don't want to shout But while we were talking, I saw you nodding out London calling, see we ain't got no high Except for that one with the yellowy eye The ice age is coming, the sun's zooming in Engines stop running, the wheat is growing thin A nuclear era, but I have no fear 'Cause London is drowning I, I live by the river The ice age is coming, the sun's zooming in Engines stop running, the wheat is growing thin A nuclear era, but I have no fear 'Cause London is drowning I, I live by the river Sing it now London calling, yes, I was there, too And you know what they said?

London calling London calling London calling London calling I never felt so much alike, alike, alike, alike I come old friend from hell tonight Across the rotting sea Nor the nails of the cross, nor the blood of Christ Can bring you help this eve The dead have come to claim a debt from thee They stand outside your door Four score and three Did you keep a watch for the dead man's wind? Did you see the woman with the comb in her hand? Wailing away on the wall on the strand As you danced to the Turkish song of the damned You remember when the ship went down You left me on the deck The captain's corpse jumped up And threw his arms around my neck For all these years, I've had him on my back This debt cannot be paid with all your jack Did you keep a watch for the dead man's wind? Did you see the woman with the comb in her hand? Wailing away on the wall on the strand As you danced to the Turkish song of the damned Did you keep a watch for the dead man's wind? Did you see the woman with the comb in her hand? Wailing away on the wall on the strand As you danced to the Turkish song of the damned And as I sit and talk to you, I see your face go white This shadow hanging over me is no trick of the light The spectra on my back will soon be free The dead have come to claim a debt from thee Did you keep a watch for the dead man's wind? Did you see the woman with the comb in her hand? Wailing away on the wall on the strand As you danced to the Turkish song of the damned Did you keep a watch for the dead man's wind? Did you see the woman with the comb in her hand? Wailing away on the wall on the strand As you danced to the Turkish song of the damned Did you keep a watch for the dead man's wind? Did you see the woman with the comb in her hand?
