No more bets, please. 33, black. THE SKIN OF SORROW No more bets, please. You don't need to be old to know the human soul changes as the wind. Take me for instance... Anyone who would have asked a few weeks ago what I thought about handing my money - one single napoleon - over to luck, the roulette or cards, I would have said it's the silliest thing on Earth. Black. And odd. Place your bets, please. One napoleon on red. Red. No more bets, please. Bets are closed. The silliest thing... 24, black, even. Nothing on the number. Please place your bets. About me again. Anyone who would have asked me what I thought about suicide, I would have said there's always hope. I thought I knew everything. Me, Raphael de Valentin, a young man with a bright future ahead of him just a year before... I was 20 at the time. I had faith. I mean, faith in me... Yes... I believed in myself. Epicurus thinks Gods don't care about men's fate... So it's pointless to fear them. Barely a man, I was already a fighter, and I chose the most noble weapon, the mind. A fight that I knew I'd be winning with verve. God, I'm so ordinary. Very well, Pauline. Please do it again. Your philosophers interest you more than my false notes. I'm close to the conclusion, it's a tough passage. Can't you smell that musty odor? It smells like catacombs. Stop! The wind already blew away my 8th chapter. I give up. The lesson is over. I'm sorry. Once I'm done, we'll have all the lessons you want. Your study field is quite vast. - Yes. - Student? No, I'm an autodidact, I'm writing a book. About what? About the great schools of thought from the Greek-Roman to our era. I found an innovative approach and I hope to become a reference. A reference? Very well. Indeed... - And what do you study? - Me? One of the greatest French families, the Duke Henri de Villeret. Very interesting subject. - What did he do? - Daughters. The youngest is still unmarried, 20,000 pounds of annuity. - And you want to... - Marry her, yes. The social register is a perfect tool. We know who goes to the opera, who's seeing who. I plan on approaching her at the opera. But I need an excuse, so I'm studying. Your Duke... Villeret... He is the descendant of Francois de Villeret, personal adviser of Henry IV. Specialized in horses... and mistresses. Tell her this, it might impress her. Tell me more. - Rastignac. - Raphael de Valentin. I'm still hesitating over my pen name. - Aristocrat, then? - No, only the "de" remains. My father lost his money during the Restauration. That's why I didn't know the name. What happened to your mother? I lost her when I was 8. So you're penniless? My book will make me famous. I made a promise to my father on his deathbed. Famous and Rich. And you expect to do that with your book? My book is called The Theory of Will. Only my mind will bring me glory. - I'm eager to see that day coming. - Count on it. I bet that in a while, my book will replace the sentimental stories of Finot in that storefront. Believe me, to succeed a good suit is more useful than studies. - I will prove you wrong. Raphael? The piano lessons you give to Pauline are not enough to pay your debts. - Mother! - How will we survive if tenants don't pay? Your father didn't come back from all I know. Times are tough. I understand, I will pay you back. With interests, when my publisher pays me. You found one? No... But I will soon. I'm certain of it. First, please accept my apologies not to have answered quickly. 958 pages is even longer than a poetry collection. Although some poets write 1,000 pages or more. It took me three years to write it. - I weighed every word. - Remarkable. Such a precise exegesis. Who would have thought to do such chore? When I started writing, I knew the readership would be interested. You would be an excellent teacher. Have you thought about it? It can't be published? Published... My dear, only historical novels can be published, or the ones by Finot, my most selling author. You know The Red & the Black? That novel led more young people to commit suicides than Napoleon's districts. Well... It means less readers. Smoke it, both ends. It's wiser than to write books. I only dreamt of being famous thanks to my talent, I fell to earth with a bang. Rastignac was right, there are more efficient ways to climb socially. But I took advantage of none of them. And now, it was too late for me. Money, please. Merchant? Anybody here? Yes, it's time to die. To die? Good evening. Good evening. How can I help you? I'd like to buy the pistol from your storefront. What's your price? I will sign an acknowledgment of debt and my servant will come in an hour. In an hour? He will be too busy to clean up your mess. No, not at all. You're young. What misfortune have you suffered to impose yourself such a punishment? I am... in deep misery. - All my hopes had been betrayed. - You mean, your desires. Wanting burns us and power destroys us. And behind this lies the most terrible sin, vanity. I'm not vain, I'm ambitious. - Well, I was. - Whatever you call it. Only the mind enhances man. Knowledge never fed me. Misery, debts, hunger... Shame... These are the vices that push a man to suicide. Do you really want to die? Then I have a more enjoyable tool for you. Look. In this safe lies a skin of sorrow. This is the skin of an onager. A donkey from the East. The elders thought it was magical. A skin of sorrow? Want and your wishes will come true. - Is it Sanskrit? - A scholar. Do I have to polish it for a genie to appear? The power of the skin of sorrow has a price. It will shrink after all the wishes according to their importance. And your life will shrink as well. You won't live long. Dying in an enjoyable way thanks to a skin. It can't be. Aren't we here to suffer to get to paradise? Others, as desperate as you, didn't have the courage to take it. Once the pact is done, it can't be undone. There's no coming back. Even if you have regrets. Regrets? What regrets could I have? I'll take it! - Regrets! - You just sealed the deal. Make good use of it. At the risk of dying, may it be in pleasure. May the skin of sorrow give me everything, right now. Glory, the most divine women. And a meal worthy of a king, with golden plates. A feast, an orgy, a bacchanal! I want everything tonight! - Well? - You thought everything will appear before you right here. If it's as magical as you say. Your first wish is so vulgar that chance will grant it. Stop your poppycock, old man. You must be crazy to believe in this. But I'm not, so I'm leaving right away. I can't take it back. It's your now. Thank you, sir. I don't believe either in God or the Devil. Or the skin of sorrow. Farewell, sir. - I was close to falling down. - What's going on? Raphael! What a chance! Come with me, we're going to dinner. - No, not tonight. - Yes, tonight! We are all invited to Taillefer's. Come on! I already regretted that Rastignac was taking me to Taillefer's. Even my will to die was weak. You are all probably wondering why a banker like me would create a newspaper. Have I lost my mind? Probably, because I decided to invest 200,000 francs. That shows how I care about Le Contestataire, which isn't like any other newspapers. I want it free and debauched, pertinent and revolting. And to sap with panache the right-thinking that had been strangling our country like a boa. From what I am the perfect example. I had to choose an editor-in-chief to fight that battle, a writer that will never be at a loss for words. To this end, I consulted an expert in perfidy. I'm talking about my dear Rastignac. Let's raise our glasses to that man who will instill his feverish talent. I appoint Raphael de Valentin, to be our new editor in-chief. You almost missed that! Are you happy about getting such an important job at your age? Very. Yes, thank you. He writes better than he talks. Let's eat, my friends! So, you're a famous journalist? What a wonderful work! Let's talk while eating. I'm starving, aren't you? It's funny... A few hours ago, I thought luck had deserted my life. Now, I get a newspaper, I'm with a goddess, at this sumptuous dinner. What am I saying? A bacchanal! So... What is it? A tale. So you're really magical? Help me spread it. - Is it a game? - You can say that. Don't move. What do we win? Here's its size. And now, I wish to be rich. It can't be bad. Rich, you hear me? No, it's a stupid game after all. We have better things to do. - Let's eat. - You're different, I like you. The skin of sorrow may finally bring good fortune upon me. Are you Raphael de Valentin? Son of Camille and Emile de Valentin? - I am. - Maitre Cardot, attorney. Mr Taillefer summoned me to assess the newspaper. He mentioned you, I knew I'll find you here. Congratulations. - I'm honored by Mr Taillefer's... - That's not my point, sir. You're rich, very rich. - Is it a joke? - That's not part of my skills. Do you know the mayor Flaherty? Yes, my father and him were friends. But they lost touch when the major left. The Major is dead. He had no heir and he heard about your trouble, he had decided to leave his money to you. Please. This is just a preview. 6,000 gold bars are waiting for you in a bank in London, as well as many deeds of property. I knew I'd back the right horse! - You beat all records! - Remember, we were always here. Please marry me. I'll share, you can have the mistresses you want. I think I just lost my editor. Wait! You're a king now, do you realize? What will you do with all that money? Do? Everything that happened last night, I wished it. That piece of skin granted it. - It shrank like the blind man said. - What are you talking about? Have you lost your mind because of the surprise? Appoint me property manager, I'll make good use of it. Stop now! What a bunch of opportunistic people! They're so greedy! But not me, I know you. You're right. Joy upsets me. I'm rich, incredibly rich! Just wait and see! That's better! Demanding everything and getting it. This is a pleasure few people could taste, even if they lived several lives. My Lord, the prince of Asturias invites you to dinner tonight. And tomorrow, Mr Oblitz will come to present his masterpieces. Perfect. Thanks, Jonathas. The house is splendid. I'm certain your father would be very proud of you. I can tell you now that he was worried at the end of his life. I'm sure that... he admires you from above. Really? - No reason for that. - My Lord. My life won't be long, but it would have been even shorter if I haven't met that strange man. Luxury over misery. Pleasure over unhappiness. Excess, no more deprivation. Pleasure is my only motto, the only rule I respect. Heloise... Beautiful name. Beautiful breasts. I don't know more intense pleasure than to spread it around me. Most of all, glory awaits. I enslaved it like a rebel bitch I finally subdued. Nothing can resist me. I can now heal all my injuries. But one seemed incurable. To be honest with myself, it was not the failure with the publishers that pushed me to take the skin of sorrow. The reason of that deeply desperate action was something more personal, a deeper wound. It's been 10 days since he got out. He refuses to eat. Use your key. Thank you. My poor man! Don't be so dramatic. Is it because the mean publishers refused your book? We well know books aren't published for their content. - Leave me alone. - Oh! I thought you were dead. - So proud! Losers have pride. - Go away! Do you rather die in that dump? - Go away! - Too much repetitions for an erudite. Raphael! Look at me! What do you see? The most worthless man on Earth. But that man has the whole aristocracy at his feet. And I'm not done. I'm soon to be a duke. - I know your theory! - No theory, just common sense. You want glory, wealth, admiration? You're doing it all wrong. Get on your feet! We will start by visiting my tailor. - I have no money. - Perfect! You will get into debt like any good man and make your banker happy. That's a start. Miss. - Where are we? - At Fedora de Malicante's. Parisian half Russian, Russian half Parisian. Friend of writers and artists. She has almost 80,000 pounds of annuity. - How? - Complete mystery. Nobody ever saw her husband, the Duke de Malicante. The most surprising thing is she doesn't have a lover. Those who tried were rejected. This is the center of the world. Excuse me. Listen, I don't want to meet your countess and these people are ridiculous. Do you want to be published or not? Do you want to be famous or not? I can let you in the most important salon, but it's up to you to stay. Don't waste this opportunity or I strangle you. Sorry, Rastignac. I really can't. Please come in. Thank you. Already, sir? - Raphael de Valentin. - Countess Fedora de Malicante. You seem in a hurry not to present your compliments. Sorry, I have no gift for flattery. You have one to be unpleasant. I told you, I don't belong here. Be unpleasant then, since you seem gifted for this. Find one of my flaws without knowing me. Then I will hate you and be happy to see you leave. A flaw? I'm not sure I can. A defect will suit you? A defect? A defect, yes! Your perfect physical appearance creates an image and that image dominates the being inside it. Wonderful. Please, go on. Let me introduce you to some friends. Tell me, Mr de Valentin, what do you do when you're not unpleasant? - I'm a writer. - I don't think I ever saw your books. I'm finishing an essay about the great schools of thought from the Greek-Roman to our era. It sounds fascinating. For those who don't just read sentimental stories, sure. But that's not your case, right? Here is a candidate worthy of your talent. La Fontaine agreed with this. The classical literature gives a model, an honest man, restraint, open, curious without being pretentious. He is pleasant, knows how to be like, physically and verbally. We are far away from those romantic heroes, bumptious and narcissistic! When you don't know what you're talking about, just hush. - Please, stop that diarrhea of words. - Diarrhea? Raphael de Valentin, the baron of Verneuil. What do you have to say about Romanticism? Please be consistent, or disappear. That's the rule and I apply it. Romanticism is the golden age of prose. It shakes up the right-thinking of our materialistic society to make us discover the interiority of the being. The romantic hero isn't afraid of doubt, melancholy and disillusions. He's not infallible, his dream is to overthrow this world of pretends, and to bring us back to the most important virtues of man, that should also be the virtues of literature, modesty and humanity. He is the spokesman of a generation full of hope and ambition to change the world, but it doesn't touch you, old man. I just succeeded my entry into the world. Rastignac was right. It was easy. I wasn't thinking about it, I have met Fedora. Look! Come on, look! Look at those jealous eyes. It's the third time we go out this week. What devil pushes you to invite me? Aren't you tired of my unpleasant remarks? They may be sharp, but so much better than the compliments of greedy people after my money. Speaking of greedy, have you read my book? Just the dedication. An adorable dedication to your father. I'm eager to read it. Being the favorite of the most wanted woman in Paris was a new feeling. And charming. It had a price. Slow down! Thank God it's not an organ! - Slowly, you'll damage it. - Please, take my place. How will I play during my lessons? You know enough for a man to be interested in you. But it was your mother's piano. I have to get rid of it, it's too cumbersome. - Cumbersome to the pawnshop. - Come on, let's go. - Did you enjoy dinner? - It was delicious. I don't think I can accept more invitations. I don't want to enjoy too much the easy life you have. You'll be mad. I still haven't read your book. But I refuse to ask for your forgiveness, of course. So, be very, very unpleasant to me. There's no rush. I'm the one who should apologize. I had the wrong idea about you. You're the most extraordinary being I have ever met. A such long sentence to tell me I'm your friend. You're better at sarcasm than at compliments. Don't talk to me about love, it's a burden I don't want. - What am I doing here then? - Only your friendship matters. Don't spoil it like the others. Content yourself with this. And I heard that the count of Navarreins was your uncle. You never mentioned him... - I don't see him much. - Too bad. He has a lot of contacts in St Petersburg. He's the only one that can make my marriage with the count valid to the emperor's eyes. - Your marriage? - Yes, that's how I got my title and I care about it. I'll talk to my uncle tomorrow if it can please you. Would you like a coffee? Thank you. I knew you could help me. What do you think of Raphael? Isn't he adorable? If you think he's worthy of your circle. His father supported the Liberals during the Restauration. He died in misery... and shame. Did my uncle answer to your demands? He did. Follow me, I have to show you my collection. The duchess is lonely. Keep her company. Aren't they all wearying? At least, you leave me alone. You're the sweetest. I should name you. Who do you remind me of? You stay at the corner of a chimney, quiet and obedient. When I get tired of your teary eyes, I send you to your doghouse. That's the spitting image of Raphael! I should... call you... Raphael... How could I be so blind?! So you came back to whine. What do you see? A cold-hearted monster? An horrible mermaid! A gargoyle that just got out of hell. I know your remarks by heart. Please, get out. I'm tired. Don't be too proud. Soon, you'll lose your charm. You'll look like this rag. - You'll end up alone. - With money come friends. Getting old is more enjoyable when you're rich. If you knew all the sacrifices I made to try to move your cold heart. And inspire you love... - I would have done... - I don't need a master. I don't like you, this conversation bores me to death. Farewell. Don't kill yourself because of me. It would be in such bad taste. I doubt a man will ever die for you. What are you doing? I'm begging you. If money is the problem, mother can give you credit. Don't leave. I found a job in Orleans. In Orleans? It's because of a woman, right? No... How can you think this? Whoever she is, she doesn't deserve your suffering. So many women could make you happy. You're a really sweet person. Good bye. Here. Take it. For the travel. Coach driver! To the casino! Pauline's napoleon could have saved me. But I didn't care any more. I was so hurt by Fedora that I had to hit rock bottom. Without any chance to get better. Thanks to the skin of sorrow, today, I can do anything. But how to hurt Fedora as much as she hurt me? She doesn't seem to feel anything for anybody, except herself when she looks in the mirror. You will shrink again. I have a new wish. Money isn't everything. - You! - Yes. Me. - Well? - I came to hush a rumor about you. In your interest. A rumor? Not here. Follow me. - What's that rumor? - You'll see. First, I have a question. You rejected me because I was poor, right? Poor and arrogant. And now, you're rich and even more arrogant. Are you hoping to buy what you couldn't get? Oh no. I won't buy. I just need to wish. And you won't even object. See, my desire don't care about yours. You will... beg me. - Yes? - What's the countess doing? He's hurting the countess? Hurry! Stay here! Forgive me, my dear, but, I think we're being watched. Please take my place. You shrank a lot since the last time. I had to do it. The brand new reputation of Fedora spread like wildfire. People say she doesn't see anybody any more. She stays home all day long. I can imagine that she misses the looks of respect and admiration. Looking at a skin shrinking, it's like living in hell. I'm done now. Yes, I will stop wanting. I think I have everything. I will enjoy every single minute I have left. You didn't expect this, did you? Of course, I did. The blind man? How did you come in? - You came to lecture me. - No, I was wondering how you were. You used the skin a lot already. Do you have everything you want? Even more. I have glory. I can do what I want when I want it. I just avenged myself, the reason why I came to your shop. I live a 1,000 lives in one. I won't live long, but it won't be dull. Very well. You're just a cynical man only interested in pleasure. You live a 1,000 lives without sharing any of them. Is that really you, Raphael? The incredible powers the skin of sorrow has, are they only for one person? You gave me the chance to be king, so I did. What did you expect? A king can think about his subjects from time to time. So what? What about me? Who cared about me? Maybe my mother. It didn't bring her luck. She died so young. PAWNSHOP That's what I thought. The interests weren't paid. It was sold. Who is the buyer? I want that piano. - It's impossible. - It's really important to me. I'll pay the price you want. I wish I could, my Lord. But we don't keep tracks of the buyers. Getting back my mother's piano will be my last wish. I swear. Your letters and the news, sir. Something's wrong, my Lord? No, my dear. I was daydreaming. The cook asked if you wish to eat a pheasant for tonight's meal. "Wish"! No. No, I don't wish anything. And don't say that word again! Very well, my Lord. Jonathas! I want last week's menu. For all the meals, during the whole year. I have no wish for food, I have no wish at all, is that clear? My lord. Hi, Jonathas. Is he home? He doesn't want to see anybody. - I'm sorry. - Don't be, my friend. Being depressed when you have everything is indecent. Even immoral, and I'm the one talking. Will you tell me what's wrong? - I don't deserve any of this. - What? Your money? You didn't kill the Major, old age did. You owe your success to your talent. - I bought the publishing house. - So what? You're the most read author. Yes, that's a scandal. Your book is so tedious. Well, you deserve it. And women! - Easy women. - Oh, yes. What a tragedy! I don't want things any more. No desire, no wish, nothing. Like a child who ate too much jam. I only see one cure: fasting. Go to the country and cultivate wine. Go to the desert, buy a camel. You're not funny. I can see that! I thought seriousness belonged to the past. Let's go to the theater, they play The Misanthrope, you'll see what you look like. A sad man deeply pessimistic. Look who's here! She dares going out again. I saw her servant the other day and he was worried. She still holds a grudge for the screams you got from her. She wants to strangle you from what I heard. - Strangle me? - Yes, she says it more nicely. Who's that beauty? I'm not married, I may have a chance. - Raphael? - Pauline. - What are you doing here? - My father. He came back from the Indies. He was a prisoner for many years, but he escaped. He was appointed general when he came back, as a reward. I love plays. Of course, so do you. But we only meet tonight. Of course, she's after you. Pauline... The sweet Pauline. The secretive Pauline, the generous Pauline. Was it yesterday or a century ago? You haven't eaten for two days, right? That work will kill you! I wrote the word END. - I finished the Theory of Will. - Really? Really finished? Great! A bottle was waiting for that day. I'll go fetch it. Come! Here I come, Paris! - That's Rastignac's motto. - Is he your new friend? Friend? No. He only has people owing him. Let's drink, Pauline. To my book finally finished. To my father to whom I dedicate it. As well as all the future works of his beloved son, Raphael de Valentin. Sit or you'll break your neck! What a nice racket! Impulse, breath, passion. To all our hopes! And to those we don't have. How could I neglect such an obvious fact. I must have been blind. - What did you think of the play? - It was great. I must admit I was a bit distracted. - I was so surprised to see you here. - What a chance. Thank God, you seem better than the last time I saw you. Good fortune is finally on my side. I was happy to see you again. See you soon. Father, I present you Raphael de Valentin. - Our former tenant. - Of course. My wife and daughter talked a lot about you. And I did like everybody, I read your Theory of Will, quite a workload, so rich. And that it was written in our home makes us very proud. Both of them were very helpful. I'd like to thank you. Will you come to dinner tomorrow? That's a great honor, sir. - We accept with pleasure. - See you tomorrow then. The General fell sick, a fever he got from his travels, nothing serious, but Mrs Gaudin would rather stay at his side. And I persuaded Pauline to come alone. You are... radiant. What did you change? My dress, my hair. I don't do the laundry any more, but nothing changed. I think I'm still the same, well I hope so. I try to. One should never forget where he comes from. Well, you look as happy as a woman in love. You're glowing too. You have everything, and more than that. Your wildest dreams were granted, it must be an amazing feeling. That's true. And at the same time... When you get everything you desire, you understand it wasn't that important. Money and success make most people's head spin. Sure, your house changed since you were our tenant, but underneath, you remained the same. I knew it would turn out that way. Coffee is served at Le Petit Salon, sir. An initiative, Jonathas? I didn't give orders if I recall. Since you don't want anything, I have to use my imagination. I had it brought here when you were out. I asked Jonathas to keep the secret, don't be mad at him. - How? - I couldn't resign when you sold it. I knew that things would change and that you would regret. So I paid the interests. And when my father came back, I bought it. Incredible! I don't know how to thank you. I was desperate it had been sold, I wished... I'm sorry. I'll be back in a minute. Please, play. Finding my mother's piano is a wish that costs me a lot. Look what's left of the skin! Just a quarter. Taking my years to find a souvenir from my mother! You could be merciful for once! I'm not really angry. A warm feeling seizes me when I think about Pauline. To love and to be loved in return, what's more fantastic? So much improvement. Bravo! Finally, a compliment! I waited a long time for it! You were obsessed by your book. I could see that. I was trying to play well not to disturb you. I must have been obnoxious. - Sorry. - No... When I heard about the success of your book, I thought, Pauline, you're the only one who knows the sacrifices he made. You deserve your success. I deserve nothing. I didn't see what really mattered. It's because of that woman, Fedora, that you left? I heard that you finally got what you wanted from her. And from others. Fedora was an illusion. More likely, a shadow. I was blind. Someone closer to me deserved that I look at her. Please. Don't play with words. - Even if you're so talented. - I'm not playing. Please, promise me not to do anything before being sure. Promise. Mother is waiting for me. See you tomorrow for another lesson. Pauline, I want to... Want? You shrank... again! I didn't want anything... Just Pauline. That's because I want her. Because I love her. You will take my life for that too. I give everything back. The money, the gold, that house. Everything. Let me keep Pauline. To love is beautiful. - You use her to punish me. - I don't have that power. - The pact is the pact. - I loved her before that. I always loved her, I just didn't know. You're opening your eyes, that's good. I see your moral love. I was young, vain. So what? Is that a crime to want to live everything at 20? Is that my fault, being young? And my dreams are crimes? What do you know about dreams? You don't expect anything. You kill boredom by torturing me! Am I the one to blame? You weren't strong enough to resist? You are... a victim! You're a true persecutor! I promise you that Pauline and I will grow old together. I'm not done! Come back! I'm breaking up the pact! Hey, girl! Come here! There was an antique shop right here. With a strange man selling all kinds of things. No, sir. It never existed. A magical skin can only be found in a shop that doesn't exist. Of course! Hey! I deserve my money! Look! See that skin? What if I tell you it's the most precious thing in the world? If you take it, you will be a queen, you'll be rich. You'll have princess' dresses, a castle. Take it! Even a poor girl runs away from that proposition. Only I was mad enough, if only I could go back, just once. Farewell, nasty thing! Bravo! Lovely! Are you okay? - Why? - I don't know. You seem so lost sometimes. I thought about what you said. To do nothing before being sure. And? You asked me to be sure of what I truly want. Of what I desire the most. Excuse me, my Lord. The Father wanted to see you immediately. It took me hours to reach you, my Lord. When he was ringing the bell, my sacristan saw your initials, RdV, painted on your car. Thanks to it, I found you. Let me guess. - You're the priest from Montmartre? - Exactly. Our well collapsed right after your departure. And the crumbling... The bricklayer had to rebuild everything. He found this... at the bottom of the well. This parchment must have fallen from your pocket. It looks ancient. I thought you'd like to have it back. Thank you. It's the remains of a blotter, from a great-uncle. I'm honored that our well brings people like you in our little parish. It is said that it is so deep, the wishes are whispered in God's ears. Jonathas, give him some money for the rebuilding. - And for the trouble. - Thank you. Father. What wish was so important it had to be whispered in God's ears? That priest... I thought that... I'd like to know that wish. Pauline... You're suffocating! It's those... damn cigars. - I'm calling a doctor. - No! Ask Jonathas to bring me an infusion. - Go home. - Promise me to call a doctor. Promise? Well, it's not TB. Well, I'd say it's the liver, it had damaged the lymph, which damages... Well, everything. Your colleagues think it may be a tumor in my lungs, a brain tumor, who should I believe? - Your case is unique. As if the disease was working from the outside, with no cause, but you're anemic, your health is worrying. What can I do to get better? Air, sun... It should ease the cough. But curing you... Give your body to science. It would be a great gesture for medicine. It would be an honor to carry out an autopsy on you. I might discover what is killing you. When will I die? Before summer, I'm afraid. And Pauline? Did you think about her? She would be a widow right after the wedding. Was it me who asked for wealth, glory and all frivolous things? Hello, Jonathas. How is he? Better I hope. Yes, madam. He's not here. He gave me this, for you. I can't promise you to be sure of what I want to do - Where is he? I need to talk to him. - I don't know, I swear. He left without telling us where. He gave me two years of pay and a bonus. He was equally generous with all the staff members. He asked his attorney to give this house as a present to host an orphanage. - But why? - Why? - I don't know. This room is fairly simple. Its only luxury is the view. Look! The view is wonderful, my Lord. - Just call me sir. - Fine, sir. Our house is well-known for its course of treatment. You will get better soon. I hope not. I'm not here to be cured. Thank you. While waiting for death, everything reminded me of Pauline. Not to know what she does, how she is, is a torture that will end soon I hope. Butler, close that window. It's freezing, some ladies don't like it. Let it open. It's suffocating in here. Can't it be you, sir, whose presence makes all rooms stifling. Close it! The servant gives orders now. Servant or slave? Tomorrow, at 6. I'm your man. Finally. You made your point. You're here at the right time. I'll be there. What mysterious disease did you come to cure? A pride problem? The whole city is wondering why you disappeared so suddenly. A dear friend wrote to me and I wanted to know more. You feared I died before you could avenge your honor. Was it such an insult to reconcile you with pleasure. Or to make you discover it. Poor Nesles! I wish him to have a good time. By the way... I hope he dived into the hole... He deserves a reward, doesn't he? He enjoys my friendship unlike you. You thought you deserved everything. You wouldn't have been obsessed to seduce me. We could have conquered everything. We're the same. We were never alike. I know now how good it is to love and to sacrifice yourself. To a pleasure you will never know. You think you're a moralist. You put yourself on a pedestal, but I'm not naive. You look at me like through a mirror. You can't stand that it reminds you of this part of you that you wish you weren't. To hell with yesterday's bitterness! At dawn, your honor will be avenged, and I... - And you? Nothing... Well, well... You can't live without me... Will you miss me? Blind man? Where are you? Are you sulking? I'm stealing what is yours. Oh, silly me! I forgot to tell you something last night. Did you know Pauline, General Gaudin's daughter? Yes. Why the past? You didn't know she threw herself in the Seine four days ago. She's between life and death. Heart-broken. She was abandoned. I hope you weren't thinking about her last night. When you were lecturing me about life and love. You see, Raphael? You were selfish once again when you left. People don't change. Are you ready? Here are the guns. Please pick yours. Let's draw lots to know who will shoot first. Heads, I'm first, tails, it's you. An innocent hand. Heads. You first, Benjamin. You knew I would go to her if you told me yesterday, didn't you? Give up now. You will die because my wish is... to outlive you. Let's call it quits. Coward. Your gun was defective. The Lord suggests to stop. This ends now. See? People die for me. Faster! I don't have much time! She hasn't had much left either. You're right. The only thing that matters is that she lives. Pauline, I wish your life to be long and happy. Raphael! Dying doesn't matter if... one has understood the meaning of his life. My dear, what a pleasure to see you smiling again. A true miracle. We have arrived, my Lord. My Lord? Help! Call a doctor! Stop yelling, people will panic for nothing. Hello, Pauline. Can I talk to her privately? Thank you God for that moment I hoped for. I won't leave you a second. Worse than a prison guard. These chains would be sweet to me. I don't have much time. It's a miracle we can see each other again. What is that strange disease? I left so you can't see my pitiful decline. I will love you forever. But I won't be by your side, my love, please forgive me. You have to live. - What would I do without you? - Many things I hope. Promise me I will become a souvenir. - It's impossible. - Promise me! That's the last thing I desire. - Hush. - That's true. The souvenir of a crazy first love which won't stop you from loving again. Our happiness will be brief. It will be worth a lifetime.
