Just look at all these dainty cherry blossom buds ready to explode... defying cold winds as they bravely await spring. Expect them to bloom a little earlier than usual this year. Cherry trees should bloom in Kanto within 2 weeks. But there is a place that looks to bloom ahead of others. Fujii, are you there? I sure am. I'm on the campus of Tosei University where they're announcing new students. People are gathering in anticipation... but the school still has not yet posted the results. As more people arrive, you can feel the tension in the air. I'll report back when the results are in. This is DJ Jamira ready to assail you with non-stop music. What a perfect day for a drive. What a perfect day for a drive. Let's start it all of with “Dawn Wind in My Poncho". Dawn Wind in My Poncho. We are finally here. I feel so excited now. Behind this gate, waiting for us is the future of immeasurable life. Can we get in? Why not? Okay. We're in. 'Live at Tosei University results posting" Students are searching to find their numbers. Some are snapping photos of their number on the cell phones. Congratulations. I see some on their phones sharing the happy news. Congrats, Jin! Woo-hoo! Knock it off. Come on! -You did it, man! Step inside and have a cold nectar. Watch your head now. Come in, please. Whose car is this? Well, well, well, well, well! Well, well, well, well, well! Thanks to you, the future is rosy for all of us. To think that our class president, Jin, will be... a future bureaucrat. You've got the pedigree! Large kickbacks and padded accounts. The sky's the limit. So when do we party with college chicks? They'll only laugh at us. You're heir to your dad's restaurant, Jumbo. Come on. A failing one. Don't worry. There's always reason to celebrate. I got my license. Jin's in college. Time to party! How about the beach? We're not going back? Hey. Red light. What light? Guys. You missed the turn. What turn? Back there. I didn't get in. What? Ahh! Jumbo? Pardon the intrusion. "Golden Island" Isn't this a surprise? Is that you, Nakata? Is Matahachi in? Not since morning. Probably with Hachibe. My idiot son and him were hanging around my restaurant. Go check the restaurant. I just did. Listen. I hear your band is thinking of playing at graduation. Reconsider. Why? Let them do it. You're only young once. No way. Those guys never practice. They'll embarrass themselves. By the way, "Naomi Mama", guess what? I finally went and bought it. That looks like an expensive car! Of course it's expensive. I scrimped and saved for 7 years. Even through a production stop. It's used but has less than 10,000 kilometers on it. A Celsior! Celsior? It means “the best" in Latin or something. And it lives up to its name. It's the best. How long are you going to stand there? Come. Ouch. Be careful. Listen to me. If you work hard every single day, tirelessly... someday you'll be able to afford a car like this. Yes, I see. Do you really? Take a closer look. Is she a looker or what? What a body, huh? Here I go. Wait a sec. We need a better way. Don't say that now. This paint was expensive. It won't work. It's a dent. Why'd I let you drive, Matahachi? I'm trying to fix it, okay? I'm dead. I'm dead. Give some ideas, Jin. You could create an illusion. An illusion? Use a different shade so it looks a little bigger. See? He's a genius! Will that really work? Yes, it will. - No way. How? - it will. I'm not asking you! Stop it! It'll work, I know it! It's totally logical. How is it logical? Wait, wait! Let's think about this. What else, Jin? Hey! There's more to come with DJ Jamira's non-stop music. I'm taking all of your requests so keep them coming. By fax, it's Tokyo 03-900-222. Or email me at jamira@r-japan. Hey Ai. You got 5th in our readership poll. “Ai Shiraishi" This will get more commercials. Prepare for a busy month. Did the boss listen to the song I gave you last week? I talked to him about it. He thinks it's too early. You're just starting as a pin-up. I agree it's too early to start branching out. I've got an email here from Nakano. He goes by the initial "T". “Dear Jamira" “I loved your special week public broadcast.” “Great too see you in person." Hey, thanks for coming. Want something? An opinion. About what? My song. What did you think? This would give the boss a heart attack. He's an old man. You didn't give it to him? I can't give him this. It's great to be original, okay? But it'll push people away. We talked about your image many times. That includes not smoking! Image is everything! Watch it! Hey girlie. Roll down the window a second. Is there a problem? -Who're you? This isn't about you, Gramps. Girlie. This is dangerous. It's a lit cigarette. Pedro's in Japan! Who's that? Whoah. Look. Trouble outside. Don't look, guys. A rape? In broad daylight? The world's a dangerous place. Shouldn't we help her? What if she's ugly? What? A girl's being raped? You're right. Let's see how she looks. What? He's going out there. Matahachi's got balls at least. He's an idiot. Who're you? What're you looking at? -Sorry. This is bad. Call the cops? Someone probably has. Let sleeping dogs lie. The girl's left the car. She doesn't look ugly. What? Does she look familiar to you? Madahachi. That's her! Madahachi. Hey, you're right! Awesome! Watch it! What's the hell? Hey jerkweed! Drive. I said drive! Now! Wait... Floor it! What's her problem? Eat our dust, punks! Your mommy bought you those bikes! Stop taunting them! Drop this chick off. No way! Faster Matahachi! This car's got no pickup! Why? Idiot, put it into a higher gear! It's on Low! That's the gear it was in! I said stop! What the... Don't do it! You bastards! I'll call again later. Okay. What did your dad say? He said I'm dead if there's even a scratch. Hep. What the hell are we doing? If only you'd gotten into college. So it's my fault? Did you write your name? Of course! Sorry. I don't care about college. No, no, no, that won't do, Jin. Why? One of us has to go to college. You're our only hope. Try again next year. I'd rather die than beg my dad to enter cram school. We wanted to party with smart chicks. That's all you think about. By the way... when is she going to leave? Hey, let's drive somewhere! Wait! Want to see Pedro in concert? Sure! Let's go! Let's do it! Who's that? Pedro! Forget it. Pedro Indihena! He's a Peruvian musician. Who wants to hear that? Me neither. You guys are idiots! Listen closely now. All of Pedro's back dancers go topless. What is "topless"? I'm talking a Latina boobs bonanza! We have graduation. Yeah. Our band's playing. Let's just blow it off! Blow it off! Blow it off! She's loony. It's canceled. We haven't practiced. Let's not end high school in shame. It was your idea to go out with a bang! This is way better than playing at grad! Blowing off grad would be so punk. Okay, it's settled. Let's roll! Or you'll be old men before you know it. What about Nakata? He'll figure it out. His ideas always turn out bad. His ideas always turn out bad. He could be possessed. He keeps staring. Let's go. I'm freezing. I swear my dad is going to kill me. We can't drive around in a car like that. What? Give me a hand. First run batted in! Again! Again! Another point! It's stuck! Once again! Try this out. Give it all you got! Go Jumbo! No mercy! Hep hep hep! Hey Dad!

Let's have Ai take a look. No, I think he needs to see a specialist for this. Ai would be quicker. Don't be stupid. Getting over a traumatic experience is a delicate process. You're probably right. Hey guys! Take a look at this! Stay there, Ai. This is guy talk. Important stuff. Important stuff? When people say that, it almost never really is! Believe me, it is. Wait over there. Why? What's so important? I'm not done. -Seriously, Ai. Hold it! It's Jumbo's boy day. What's "boy day"? Damn it. Can't finish? Matahachi, help! Flex your stomach muscles It won't stop! "Banana Clinic" What's up, Sally? Sorry but my kid's running a fever. He's in nursery school now so it's a frequent thing. Could you tell the manager, Maria? No, wait. Sally, you're wanted at Booth 13! Sairi, you're wanted at Booth 13! Where's Sairi? Her kid has a fever. She left? You'll have to fill in. Maria, you're wanted at Booth 13! It's time for your checkup. I'm Nurse Maria. I'll be in charge today. I'm Kohei Morita. May I sit next to you? Now then, let me begin the checkup. Pardon me. No, wait a second. Just relax. I need to tell you something first. It's... really big. Excuse me? Down there. Why of course it is. No, seriously. Look, forget it. It's all right. I'll do it myself. Sorry to scare you. What's your professional view? I mean about the size. Oh. It's very big. I know that! I've been teased all my life. I'm so sorry. I want to know if it's abnormal. Is it even human? I need an objective verdict. I'm sorry. No woman would have this. I haven't said anything. That's okay. I just needed a professional opinion. What? Actually, I was dating this one girl a little while back. And... she told me it was too big... impossible, even. We broke up because of it. So you came here? Yes. I fear there isn't a woman in the world that could have me. I'll never lead a normal life. You know with marriage and children and all that stuff. Attention, the time now is 12 o'clock! That means our weekend limited “Second Opinion Time!" Cast off your carnal troubles and be happy!

Help save unfortunate animals! Donations, please! I've got to hand it to you, Jin! You're a genius! What is this? Road trip funds, obviously. What? You stole from that parade? Lower your voice, Jumbo. No! You go return it! We're unfortunate animals, too. Don't rationalize. Someone gave 10,000 yen! Come on now! Let's get supplies! And lunch! Lunchtime, Ai! - What? - Lunch Lunch? Yes! 5 yen. Meow. Meow. Meow, meow, meow. Nice waves. Be careful. Whoah. Pretty fast. Awesome. Bottle rockets. Pain, pain go away Good health is here to stay. No, stop! Get away from me! Chill out, Matahachi! Maria, save me! Help me, Maria! Point those away! Time to go home? Yeah, we should attend graduation. What about Pedro? Who's that? Aren't we all seeing Pedro in concert tomorrow? Yeah, who is that? The Peruvian musician. Who wants to hear that? All of his back dancers go topless, remember? What? A fight? Go for it! The concert is on Kogane Island. It's a pricey ferry ride. No way. Cancel that. Okay. We have the donation box money! How will we get back, idiot? Who cares? Are Latina boobs that special? No! I want to see Pedro! We may never get another chance to see Pedro again! What's bugging you? Yeah, it's weird. Hey. Matahachi? Matahachi. Come on. Leave him be. If you've got something to say, spit it out. What's this? A photo of Pedro. What is it? A photo of Pedro. It's a photo of Naomi Mama. Who's Naomi Mama? Matahachi's mom. The handsome kid in the middle is me. Really? The truth is... I'm half Peruvian. With that face of yours? It says, "Beloved Naomi and son". I wanted to hear my dad sing live once. But I never... could go alone. Why didn't you say so? Ouch. Have you ever met him? Never. I stole that photo from my mom's dresser. She's never mentioned him. We've been hanging out all these years. But I know nothing about you. Sorry. Beyond the hills we travel Whistling all the way Blue skies above us To the big ranch we go Singing our hearts out Hand in hand la la la la La la la la Mr. Duck!

Okay, okay. What the hell? Hey. Where's Maria? Gone. Why? Where is the money? "To the cherry boys." "We're not into Peruvian singers." "We went home for a bath" "and a change of clothes." "I hope you see your dad." "See you. Bye-bye." See you. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. It is now time for boarding. All passengers with boarding tickets... “Kogane Island Ferry" please board the vessel now. Who were those girls? They could've left us ferry money. Hey Jumbo. What's on your back? It's been bothering me. My back? There. Right there. "Kanna Onuki" “TEL. 080-5001-013..." This is just our luck. Failing at critical moments. Well, enough of that. Time to make our exit. What? You always give up to quickly, Jin. No, you don't know when to quit. You give up too quickly. You don't know when to quit. Nope. You always give up too quickly. Fine, I always give up too quickly. What do you want? Jin, go on ahead! Jumbo! Jumbo! Matahachi! Hurry! It stuck! Okay. We're in business. This looks really dangerous, you know. Jumbo. I don't know who it was, but somebody said it. "Lose courage, lose everything." "Lose courage, lose everything." "Hachibei" Jumbo. What? Me and Matahachi will work off the car repair fees. Thanks. But I think it's ready to be scrapped. Nothing good comes with that guy. It's kind of sad this is the end, though. Why's it the end? Matahachi will be getting a job. I'll take over the restaurant. And you, Jin. Give me? Are you inviting me? Hey, how was it? I'm going with my dad. I'll might be gone a while. Probably Peru. That's sudden. What about Naomi Mama? I'll write from Peru. She can handle it. Wait a second. Think about it. It's never too late or too early. I've made a decision. I'm going with dad. But... the car. Oh yeah, I'm the only licensed driver. No, mean Pedro's car. What? Hey, wait! Wait for me! Wait up! Don't leave me! Hey! Dad! I suppose it's time to work. Okay. What's going on here? Figure it out? "Dear Naomi and son..." “Thanks for buying our CD." That photo was after buying a CD. Matahachi. Throw with the left. Oh, caught it. Graduation tomorrow. What'll we do? We could keep driving west. As far as Kyushu. Wow. I've never been that far in my life. I have a cousin in Fukuoka. We could crash for free. You serious, Jin? I don't know. Watch it. Happy time is always quick - It's time to say goodbye again. - Hit the wall. Let me read you one last interesting listener email. From “Mr. Rat” in Shinjuku. I lead a boring high school life. Nobody notices me there. It's like I don't exist. But then I went and joined a band. We're even planning on performing at my graduation ceremony. I'd be grateful if you could give us a shout out of support. You totally rock, Mr. Rat. Japan's No. 1 high school teen. Playing at grad is a dream. I wish I could've done that, but I didn't have a band. I'm so jealous that you have friends to make music with. That's awesome. Everybody out there, send good vibes to Mr. Rat at graduation. That's all for today. Thanks for hanging out. Until tomorrow, keep those antennas of the heart raised. As long as you do that, Jamira's music will never stop. See you tomorrow, same time, every place. Rock out, Mr. Rat! So who cares about tomorrow?
