So, when, um, I went to the hospital, um, they said that they, they can't rebalance things anymore. they've changed my tablets around, they've tried different combinations of everything and essentially what's happened is that there is fluid that's building up on, on the lungs, it's all, all going on inside.

[overlapping conversations] I'm so glad you got to meet Andrew, and, um-- - I love you. - I love you. - [Eleanor] Er, mine's a little too, yeah. - [tapping on glass] Um, I'd like to make a toast, to the most gracious, generous, kind woman. I would have probably been, okay, I'm saying it wrong, if I'd had a mum like you, I wouldn't be like I am, in a bad way, you know what I mean? - [Iris] Yeah. - [Eleanor] Like I'd just be-- I'd just be better, 'cause I never-- I never had that. So, I am so glad that you guys have had that and I know I've gone on too long, I'm sorry. [clears throat] [sighs] I'm just a little drunk, sorry. But I do wanna say is that you have the most amazing, brilliant daughter. - [all] Here, here. Yes. She is smart, funny, sweet, kind. But really, really fucking talented.

[overlapping conversations] [Iris] How did you know we were here? - You're welcome. - Keith, did you invite Bobby? - Yep. - Yeah, is that a problem? [Iris] Why'd you guys even talk? - We always talk. - [Bobby] We talk a lot. - Bobby. - Why did we break up? Please leave. Do you really wanna have this conversation - in front of mum and dad? - Yes. I haven't actually explained it fully to mum and dad yet, so maybe-- I'm a changed man, I've changed everything. A new outlook, what I do, who I am, new hobbies. Keith knows. Keith's the man. Come on, give it a go, Keith says you're doing music and something's going on with somebody else, - sounds very strange. - Nothing's going on. Before I was not listening to the music ironically. Okay, and now I hear it all and I love fishing now, everything to do with aquariums, fish, fish pumps, tank pumps. And that's been able to help me make women happy. I'm a changed man, I have changed. There is a lot of change going on. There's a lot. And within that change is change, and more change. - I used to be about cars, women, booze. - [coughs] And I'm no longer about that anymore. I like women, sure, and booze, of course, but I don't like cars anymore. - [bartender] Whisky? - [Eleanor] Just a wee, wee bit, - A little bit of whisky. - A wee bit, a titch, just a titch. [laughter] - [man] I think you should stop. - Good. [woman] I think you can, like yeah, a good kiss is definitely a good indication if somebody's gonna be right. - You okay? - I can be a really good kisser - with one person. - Yeah, Bobby. I can't kiss another person. You don't-- You don't seem okay. [Eleanor] You know what, can I just say - this whole English thing. - Is-- We're Welsh. You had to do that though, didn't you? Yeah, I know, I'm kind of, uh, sorry, immediately sorry about it. You made a bit of a scene though, didn't you? - [muttering] - You what? I'm sorry. - Sorry? - Yeah, I'm very sorry.
