Hi-ho! This is Kermit the Frog, and I'm here to tell you the story about Emmet Otter's... That's Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas. It's a good thing I didn't damage the sign here. You'll notice that it points the way to Frogtown Hollow. That's where Emmet and his ma live. Somebody's coming. -Hey, look, it's a frog! -No, that's a toad. Frogs ain't that ugly. Right, Chuck? Now, wait a second, you guys. Hey, Chuck-o, you see anything you like? How about the scarf? -You got it! -Hey! That was a bunch known as the "Riverbottom Gang", and, unfortunately, you're going to be seeing more of them, too. Because, like Ma and Emmet, they're all part of Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas. Long, long ago There lived a lady Simple, but elegant As any on the shore She was known for her generous silhouette And yet She was known even more for The bathing suit she wore Once a pirate tried to steal it It was rumored he was gonna use it For a pirate sail "I'm innocent of such an act," he cried "The fact is that's a perfect diaper For a baby whale" Sweet Grandma's eyes How they could charm you Five generations of loving friends she made All the children enjoyed her In many ways somedays When the sun was a scorcher Grandma Otter was their shade Even so, it was her bathing suit that made her famous It was almost heaven-sent Many times when it was drying on the line A tourist would mistake it for a circus tent Ahoy, Emmet. I'm fishing. What are you doing? Deliverin' laundry, and goin' to Waterville. See you, Wendell! Now, she has gone Now, she has left us Left with sweet memories And left with something more We've made curtains And handkerchiefs And clothing for the poor From the one bathing suit That your Grandma Otter wore From the one bathing suit That your Grandma Otter wore Say, Ma, that sounded pretty nice. Nice? I should say it did, Emmet. Why, you can hear the fish applauding. I think you're right. Maybe I should pass the hat. Pa used to say, "If you pass the hat to fish, all you get is a wet hat." Still, I suppose the fish have just about as much money as any of us this year. Couldn't have much less. -Ma? -Mmm. What are we gonna do about Christmas this year? Oh, better lean into that starboard oar. There's old Gretchen Fox on her dock, waitin' for her laundry. Ooh. She looks friendly as a polecat today. Well, it's about time you got here! Same time we always get here. Yes, you're late every week. And last week, when I opened the laundry parcel, there was a scorch mark on one of the sheets. Oh... Well, maybe, I can knock off a little bit on the price. -I... -You certainly shall. Remind me of that when I pay you next week. Ta. Well, I got the bill right here. And since it's three days till Christmas, I'd really appreciate it if you'd fall off the dock. Way to go, Ma. Yeah, well, sometimes, you gotta talk tough to these people. -Yep, that's tellin' her, Alice. -Mornin', Will Possum. -Mornin'. -I didn't see you sittin' there. Well, that's okay, Alice. Listen, you got anything to barter with today? Oh, glad you asked. Just knitted up a fine pair of wool socks. Great! I got a few big, old pumpkins. Pumpkins, huh? I can make them into pies and sell them at a profit. Well, they're in the garden, right over here. Can you make much money on those pumpkin pies, Ma? Oh... About enough to buy wool for another pair of socks, I guess. Good thinkin', Ma. Now, you can knit more socks to buy more pumpkins to sell more pies to buy more wool. All right! All right! Lean into those oars, or we'll never get to Waterville. Stop! Hey, what'd you do that for? Right, boss? Me and Chuck's going to lunch. We don't wanna stop. -Right, Chuck? -My neck! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yeah, there's a music store over there, and Snake needs a new string for his guitar. Get off my shoulder. I'm goin'. I'm goin'. Jeez, a fella should be grateful he's got shoulders. Come on, guys. Let's go in the store. Are you crazy? Me and Chuck don't wanna go to no dumb music store. -No, no, I didn't think so. -I'd like to. -Yeah! -Why not? I'll stay here. It's too dry in there. Hey, you, you young rag scamps! You just messed up my fruit stand! Oh, so sorry! Right, Chuck? Sorry about that. -Is that all the errands we have to do? -No. But it's the end of the money we have to do 'em with. Might as well head for the river, then. Wait now, Emmet. Didn't Sam Turtle pay you for fixin' his steps yesterday? No. I was the one who broke 'em. Oh, Emmet, you with your odd jobs, me with my socks and pumpkins. -No wonder we're so rich. -We'll make out. -You gotta have faith, Ma. -Oh, I got plenty of faith. I spent all those years married to a snake-oil salesman, didn't I? Well, Pa should have gotten rich on snake oil, but there just aren't enough... ...people who want to oil a snake. Pa used to always say that when business was bad. Yup, he said it a lot. Wait, now. Would you look at that! -What? -That swell guitar. Mother-of-pearl inlays, too. Now, Ma, that's what you can get me for Christmas. Oh, sure! After all, it's only $40. Say, what is that racket? No,no,no! Please! I can't believe what's happening here in my store! -What are you doing? -Who are they, Ma? Beats me. Hooligans is what they are. Probably some of those Riverbottom boys. Now see what you've done! I want all of you out of here! Now! You're all the same! Here you go. It ain't even hurt. If they didn't want these things to roll, they should've made them square. Hey. -Yeah, Chuck? -I'm hungry. Hey, everybody! Chuck's hungry! No, I'm not hungry. I'm hungry! Check, Chuck. -Now! -Let's go eat! Come on! Gettin' colder every day now. -Be walkin' the river soon. -And skatin' on it. Got to expect cold weather just a few days before Christmas. Don't talk about Christmas all the time. There's no point, is there? We don't have enough for regular days. Sorry. I remember the last Christmas before Pa died. Oh, Emmet. I remember decoratin' the Christmas branch, and Pa sang, and you played that old piano we had. I remember, all right. Sellin' that old piano was one of the saddest things I ever had to do. Seems like we've sold just about everything last couple of years. About all I got left is a sense of humor and a washtub. Well, at least, there ain't no hole in the washtub. There ain't no hole in the washtub! That's what you call your basic "Keeping warm while you're rowing home" kind of song. I'm rowin', where's the singin'? Head full of good thoughts Belly full of grub Money in your pocket When there ain't no hole in the washtub Sweet as honeysuckle on the vine, Ma. Your nails won't break And your toes won't stub You never get a fever When there ain't no hole in the washtub if you look to the good side Fallin' down's a free ride Slippin' and a-slidin' in the mud If your back is hurtin' I can say for certain I'll be there to treat you To a soothing back rub When there ain't no hole in the washtub Lunch with the upper crust Dinner at the club, high on the hog When there ain't no hole in the washtub Watermelon gardens, berries on the shrub Cookies in the kitchen When there ain't no hole in the washtub Hey, Emmet! Look what I caught! Good catch, Wendell! Yeah, they're really biting today. I'll be there to treat you To a soothing back rub When there ain't no hole in the washtub There go two of the nicest folk on the river. If you look to the good side Fallin' down's a free ride Slippin' and a-slidin' in the mud Though it twists and contorts you That barrel supports you You can feed and clothe yourself With a rub-a-dub-dub When there ain't no hole in the washtub Ain't no hole in the washtub Ain't no hole in the washtub Ooh. Boy, it's cold this morning. The river's frozen up solid. Boy, Ma will be needing a mess of wood today. Hey, Emmet! Emmet! Good morning, Wendell. Guess what? Old Lady Possum will give me 50 cents if I mend her fence. Fifty cents? Good deal. Yeah, but I don't have any tools. Well, I've got the tools in Pa's old tool chest. Hey, if you could help, maybe we could split the money. Sure thing. I'll be right with you. Good! Let's see. Half of 50 cents, half of 50 cents... -Oh. Mornin', Miss Muskrat. -Morning, Emmet. -Is your ma home? -She sure is. -Let me get the door for you. -Thank you. Company, Ma! Hetty! Come in! Come in! Don't fuss, Alice. I'm just here to use the spinning wheel you keep borrowing from me. Sit down. Mercy! I don't even have water on for tea. Goodness gracious. Ma, me and Wendell got a job. Real money this time. See you! Watch out for thin ice along the riverbank. Okay. Bye, Ma! Whoa. Can that boy move fast. Now, where'd I put that teapot? -Well, Emmet, are you going to enter? -Enter what? -The contest. -I don't know about any contest. Golly, it's a talent contest at the town hall on Christmas Eve. No kiddin'. And first prize is $50. Fifty dollars? That's a lot of money, Hetty. You sure you got that right? Fifty dollars cash. That's the prize. A lot of money. I thought you might be interested, Alice. You do have a mighty fine singin' voice. Anybody'd be interested in $50. Hey, why don't you enter, Emmet? You're a good singer. Are you kidding? I couldn't get up there and sing all by myself. It'd be embarrassing. -Hi, Harvey! Hi, Charlie! -Hey, Emmet, Wendell. Hey, listen. You two are just who we've been lookin' for. -You bet! -Yeah? What's up, Harvey? Well, you know about the Waterville talent contest? Sure, everybody's heard of that, right, Emmet? Well, you see, Charlie and me were just talkin' about what we should do is organize a jug band. Yeah, wouldn't that be swell? See, I play kazoo and washboard, and Charlie here, plays a good cigar-box banjo. -I really do! My ma says. -Mmm-hmm. So, all's we need is a couple of other guys to fill out the band. Well, how come us? -You see, you can blow a jug, Wendell. -Yeah! Hey, this is a good idea, Emmet. Maybe. What would I play? What else? You get to play washtub bass. Why me? Well, because your ma's got the washtub. Oh, no, forget it. Count me out. I'm not in your band, and that's final. -Aw. -Oh. Come on. Why not, Emmet? Because, to make a washtub bass, you have to put a hole in the washtub. I don't even have a proper costume. Hetty, I can't possibly enter that contest. You're right, Alice. Forget the whole thing. Hetty Muskrat, you stop tr yin' to sweet-talk me into this. This is the fence we're supposed to mend? Well, yeah. That's not repairing. That's rebuilding. Don't just stand around, boys! You got work to do! Just once I'd like to give a fine, store-bought present to Emmet for Christmas. And with $50! I've never given Ma a nice Christmas present. Never gave one to Pa, either, and now, it's too late. Harvey says $50 split four ways is $12.50. A lot of money. That guitar we saw in town, the one with the mother-of-pearl inlays, Emmet really wants it. But $40! I can't buy a piano for $12.50, anyway. But you could put a down payment on a used one. But if I do enter, I've got to have a costume, and to buy a costume, I'd have to hock somethin'. Nothin' left to hock. Of course, there's Pa's old tool chest. But Emmet uses that for odd jobs. We would make a good jug band, but to put a hole in Ma's washtub... He sure would like that guitar. Nothin' would make her happier than havin' a good, old piano again. I just don't know. I just can't decide. Ma! I'm home! I cut the Christmas branch. I see you did. Well, after all, tomorrow's Christmas Eve, and even if we don't have presents, at least we can have the branch. It's a nice one, Emmet. -Just like Pa used to bring home. -Yup. Every year, he'd go out, vowing he was gonna bring home a real whole Christmas tree. But he never had the heart to do it. And every year, he would say, "Because I didn't cut it down, "the rest of that tree will still be alive in 100 years!" You know, sometimes, you even sound like your pa. Ma, do you suppose it'd be safe to use Pa's slide now? Oh. I should think so. The ice must be solid by this time. -Race you to her! -Hey, wait for me now! First slide of the year! Whoopee! Wow. I forgot how much fun that is. Well, stand back. It's my turn. Whoo! Isn't that great? -It's good enough. -Good enough for what? Good enough to do again! Hey, now! My turn next! Watch, Emmet! It's my turn again. Oh, boy! Watch this one, Ma. Oh, boy, that old slide's just about the best thing Pa ever built. Yeah. He may not have left us much, but that old slide is just about enough. Gee, I think he left us a lot. Well, he left what he could. Pa used to say, "A person's got to take some chances, or life'll never come to nothin'. " He took his chances on snake oil. Fact that it didn't come to much hardly matters. Pa would hook that tool chest. Pa would put a hole in that washtub. Ma, remember Pa's favorite song? When the mountain touches the valley All the clouds are taught to fly Thus our souls shall leave this land Most peacefully Though our minds be filled with questions in our hearts, we'll understand When the river Meets the sea Meets the sea Like a flower that has blossomed in the dry and barren sand We are born and born again Most gracefully Thus the winds of time shall take us With a sure and steady hand When the river Meets the sea Meets the sea Patience, my brothers And patience, my sons In that sweet and final hour Truth and justice will be done Like a baby when it is sleeping in its loving mother's arms What a newborn baby dreams Is a mystery But his life will find a purpose And in time, he'll understand When the river Meets the sea When the river Meets The almighty sea Dear Ma, I'll be gone all day. I'll explain about the washtub when I see you late tonight. Love, Emmet. Dear Emmet, I'll be home late tonight and I'll explain about the tool chest when I see you. Love, Ma. When you meet somebody That don't like soul food They still got a soul And it don't mean that you got no rhythm If you don't like rock 'n' roll Well, if your taste's like mine You like cider, not wine And your very favorite thing to do Is get a purty girl dancin' to jug-band music And a mess of Mama's barbecue -Barbecue -Lifts my spirit I swear that it never fails And the sauce Mama makes Just stays there forever If you dare to get it under your nails Well, you May be poor with a wolf at your door But money isn't everything You still have the sun and a river full of fun And you'll always have a song to sing So, get the frown off your face We're gonna replace it With a grin and a dream come true With a purty girl dancin' to jug-band music And a mess of Mama's barbecue -Barbecue -Lifts my spirit I swear that it never fails And the sauce Mama makes Just stays there forever If you dare to get it under your nails So get the Frown off your face We're gonna replace it With a grin and a dream come true With a purty girl dancin' to jug-band music And a mess of Mama's barbecue That's a purty girl dancin' to jug-band music And a mess of Mama's Mess of Mama's Mess of Mama's barbecue A mess of Mama's barbecue Oh, boy! -That was fun. -That was fantastic! I can feel the prize money in my pocket. Really? -We sound great! -Well, we sound fair. Let's do it again. -Gee, haven't we done it enough? -Yeah, we done it all afternoon. Well, let's do it some more. I put a hole in Ma's washtub for this contest, and we gotta win. Now, here we go. -Gee, Mr. Big-time Conductor. -Are you ready, Harvey? Sure. Sure. Thanks for lettin' me come over and use your sewing machine, Hetty. I still can't believe it. You actually took that tool chest and hocked it to buy dress fabric. I had to. I've got to wear somethin' for the contest, don't I? Besides, when I win, I'll have enough money to un-hock it. What if you don't win? Got to win! Emmet is gonna have a guitar with mother-of-pearl inlay this Christmas. Whatever you say, Alice. Well, we better head for Waterville. I'd like to be there early for the contest. Boy, I know we're gonna win. I just know it. Hey, fellas, do you hear something? Sounds like a car, or a motorcycle. Hey, who are those guys? I think they're from Riverbottom. Look at the birds up in the trees. Yeah? Well, we're not birds. We're a jug band. Yeah. Practicing for the talent contest. Sure. They're gonna win the talent contest. Right, boss? Shut up. Come on, everybody. Let's go! Here we go! What was that all about? Contestants, contestants, I'd like you all to go to your dressing rooms now, please, if you would. All ladies over here to the left, and men to the right, please. Miss, to the left here, and, boys, yes, over there to the right. Ladies to the left, and men to the right.

Thank you. Thank you. Welcome to Waterville's first annual Christmas talent contest. As some of you may know... I am Harrison Fox, mayor of Waterville. And first off, let me introduce our judges for tonight. Now, right down in the front row, we have James Badger, my lovely wife, Gretchen, and this year's chairman of the judges, the owner of the Riverside Rest, Waterville's favorite cafe and nightspot, Doc Bullfrog. And right now, let's get things started with Shirley and Nat Muskrat as Carrots the Dancing Horse. Bitter fail, Harrison, we're off to a shaky start. Okay, yes, thank you. Thank you. That was Lindsay and Deidre Mole with their duet for snare drum and piccolo. Well, if the acts don't get any better than that, we've got no trouble. And now, Mr. Yancy Woodchuck to sing for you, the ever-popular Barbecue. Barbecue? But that's our song. Doggone, when you meet somebody That don't like soul food They still got a soul And it don't mean that you got no rhythm If you don't like rock 'n' roll We can't do this song after he's done it. People will think we're copyin'. Yeah, we're really gonna lose now. -No, we aren't. Come on! -Where are we going? Out in the alley. We're not on for a while yet. We gotta rehearse a new song. Just stays there forever If you dare to get it under your nails Barbecue Thank you. Welcome, if you will, George and Melissa Rabbit. Well, it's gonna be a long night. You there.

We're closer now than ever before There's love in our world And we're showing it more Our world says Welcome, stranger Everybody's a friend Favorite stories don't end In our world -It's Ma. -Yeah. And she's better than we are. Some say our world is getting too small I say with kindness there's room for us all Our world is always changing Every day's a surprise Love can open your eyes In our world When night lays sad upon you Go watch a simple sunrise Love can open your eyes In our world Ma, you were fantastic! Was I all right? They seemed to like me. Ma, you were the best, hands down! You've got this contest won. Wait a minute. Emmet, what are you doin' here? Well, me and the guys have organized a jug band. -Emmet, the mayor's introducing us. -So, last, but by no means least... Uh-oh. Come on. Four young lads, whom I'm sure you'll enjoy. They call themselves the Frogtown Hollow Jubilee Jug Band. How much alike we are Perhaps we're long-lost brothers We even think the same You know there may be others We can always use a friend This family just keeps growing This family doesn't have to end Brothers Brothers So many things to learn But we'll enjoy each lesson Problems don't worry us When half the fun is guessin' Live a lifetime of surprise We'll all become magicians And leave the wonder in their eyes Brothers Brothers Boys, you were wonderful! -Did it sound all right, Ma? -You were better than best! You're certain to win. Well, ladies and gentlemen, that was to have been our last act. Normally, we wouldn't allow any last-minute entries, but these kids have come a long way, all the way from Riverbottom. Yes, these Riverbottom boys... Come on, let's clear the way there. Come on, clear it out. -Where do you want this junk? -They've put together -a genuine rock band. -Yeah, right there. That's good. Where do you want this thing? So, let's welcome please tonight's last contestants... Here they are. The rock group known as the Nightmare. We think what we want We do anything that we wish We got no respect For animal, birdie or fish The grass does not grow On the places where we stop and stand Riverbottom Nightmare Band We know we're a mess Our type does not like to be clean We don't brush our teeth 'Cause our toothache can help us stay mean We don't wish to learn But we hate what we don't understand Riverbottom When you see us comin' You better start a-runnin' We're always startin' trouble And we're happiest When things are out of hand -Woo! -Aah! -Woo! -Aah! Tempers are for boilin' Parties are for spoilin' We even like to sit and pout Or else, go out and terrorize the land Riverbottom Nightmare Band We laugh in your face Or we practice our growl and our sneer Yeah! We break up your place We are dangerous when we are near And when we are done with our song Who will get the biggest hand Who? Riverbottom Nightmare Band Riverbottom Nightmare Band And so, the winner of our first annual talent contest is... The Nightmare! Emmet? I hocked the tool chest to get the material for my costume. Oh. Well, you can see what I did to your washtub. Yup. Evenin', Mrs. Otter. Evenin', boys. -Hi, Dr. Bullfrog. -Hi, Doc Bullfrog. I think you should know that the judges were impressed by both of your acts. They just needed, well, that little something extra. -Keep workin' on it. -Yes, sir. Well, gotta be gettin' to work. Restaurant's busy tonight. -And Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas, sir. Well, boys, looks like they're closing things down. Better head for the river. Quicker to get home if we walk on the ice. You know, Emmet, if I'd have won that contest, I would've given you that guitar with the mother-of-pearl inlay. Would you really? Gosh. I was gonna get a piano for you. A piano. Were you really? -Yes'm. -Oh, Emmet. That's about the nicest present anybody ever tried to give me. You know, Emmet, I guess I should feel pretty bad. But the funny thing is that I don't. I feel pretty good. So do I. I don't know why, but I do. I guess it's 'cause we did just what Pa would've done. Mighty nice kazoo-blowin', Harvey. Yeah. It was a great-sounding song. We should've won. Well, it just didn't turn out that way. I thought Ma's song was nice, too. I hadn't thought of that old song in years. But when I did, it just felt right. Say! Those two songs could fit together. -How do you mean, Ma? -Here. Boys! Boys! I'm gonna start singin' my song, and you come in singin' yours when I show you, okay? -Okay. -Yeah. We're closer now Than ever before How much alike we are Perhaps we're long-lost brothers There's love in our world And we're showing it more We even think the same You know there may be others Our world says Welcome, stranger Everybody's a friend We can always use a friend Favorite stories don't end Welcome, brother In our world Gee, Ma, that sounds fine. It sure does, Emmet. Some say our world Is getting too small So many things to learn But we'll enjoy each lesson I say with kindness There's room for us all Problems don't worry us When half the fun is guessin' Our world is always changing Every day's a surprise Live a lifetime of surprise Love can open your eyes Brother, look around In our world When night lays sad upon you Go watch a simple sunrise See wonder in your eyes Love can open your eyes Welcome, brother To our world That's fine music, folks. I thought you needed something a little extra, but it appears to me that what you needed was each other. Well, we're mighty honored you liked it. You wouldn't consider working at the Riverside Rest, would you? -How about it? -Oh, boy! Now, wait a minute. Is the pay regular when we play regular? Sure is, and meals are on the house. Golly! You got mashed potatoes? Sure. And you can start tonight. Peachy keen! Emmet, what do you say? Sounds better than sellin' snake oil. Well, sure. Nobody wants to oil a snake these days. We're closer now Than ever before How much alike we are There's love in our world We're showing it more You know there may be others Our world says Welcome, stranger Everybody's a friend -Favorite stories don't end -Welcome To our world And so, Ma and Emmet and the boys started to make a little regular money and a lot of really fine music. And from then on, Christmas was a little merrier along the river. I sure enjoyed our first night's work. Yeah, gonna enjoy the rest of 'em, too. Golly, I loved the mashed potatoes. Let's face it, Ma. We're better at singin' and playin' than we are at laundry and odd jobs. Yeah. You know, boys, I'd like to do a song for Pa right here and now. He took a chance on snake oil, and you took a chance on a washtub. Okay by me, Ma. When the mountain touches the valley All the clouds are taught to fly Thus our souls shall leave this land Most peacefully Peacefully Though our minds be filled with questions in our hearts, we'll understand When the river Meets the sea Meets the sea Patience, my brothers And patience, my sons In that sweet and final hour Truth and justice will be done Like a baby when it is sleeping in its loving mother's arms What a newborn baby dreams Is a mystery A mystery But his life will find a purpose And in time, he'll understand When the river Meets the sea When the river Meets The almighty sea
