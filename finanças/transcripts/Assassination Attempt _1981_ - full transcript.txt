TEHERAN-43 Part Two So? Did you understand? What are you talking about? Did you understand that I was right? Did you see my mother? - What mother? What are you talking about? - Next to Churchill, on the screen at the auction. Mademoiselle, you are insane. To talk of some mother, of Churchill, now when we both can be killed any minute. - Of course, Mr. Legrain, I understand it, but you're always so busy, and now is a good opportunity. Mademoiselle, stay away from this case. Thus will be better both for your mother and you. This is my advice for you. Where did you sit? - There. - Go then. Yes? Got you. - The authorities decided to exchange you for the hostages on the plane. - I know it. Personally, I am against it. I would rather... I would rather shoot you at the attempt to escape. I know it. I know much about people. If you decide to return to my country, keep in mind: I look forward for meeting you. Don't dramatize. You are as safe for me as a ladybird. There is too much democracy in your country. Excuse me, don't you have... - Excuse me, don't you have Validol? - Oh, sure. Here you are. - Thank you. Heart? - Yes, it's stuffy here. Thank you. - Oh, no, leave it. I've seen you at the auction. - I've been there.. You are probably upset because you didn't manage to buy the document? It's a big loss. You know, my colleagues in the German Society of Military History Lovers will be very upset and discontented with it. I have never heard about your Society. What is your program, if it's not a secret? We collect and return to life the documents of the last World War. Excuse me, I just want to understand. The document you were trying to buy, reveals one more attempt of assassination, doesn't it? Political terror has always existed. It's a fact, and quite an explicable one. Let's reason. Human life has a certain price, so it cannot be not taken into account in political disagreements. - But thus you justify terrorism. Look, whether we really should attach such a huge importance to terrorism? Every day more people die in car accidents than for all the years of terror. Yes, but it is an accident, while here is the contempt of the human life, cynicism. Starting from the 18th row everybody stays seated! The rest go out through the front door! From the 18th row! Everybody stays seated! Sit down! Go out quickly! Quickly! Attention please! The flight 327 has landed in the Orly airport. The hostages released today in the morning are on board. Excuse me... Oh, it's you. I am so grateful to you. I thought he would kill me. Did you see his eyes? If it were not for you he would probably kill me. Yes, I did. Don't you want to have a coffee? - Sit down, please. - Thank you. Two coffee, please. - Look, do you know who we were exchanged for? - No. I will show you. It's some fantastic person. Look what they write here. His time in prison would end exactly in a month. It's strange. Why all this story with hijacking the plane if he was to be released in a month anyway? That's the point. It's impossible to understand. It's absurd! There must be some sense in his actions. You know, I even like this entire story. Why are you looking at me thus? - How? ? In a strange way. Is your surname Lunie? - How do you know? - I recognized you right away. Recognized? Have we met? No, but I have seen you at Legrain's office in Paris and later at the auction in London. Don't be afraid, I won't harm you. Tell me, can I meet your mother? My mother? So it was you who followed her? Followed? Well yes, recently I have noticed that somebody follows her all the time. Was it you? No, it wasn't me. Please, give me your mother's address. She is in danger. I have to go. Ok, Mr. Commissar. Yes, I have her address. Her daughter has just given it to me in the airport. Excuse me, I can't hear. What's the name? Inspector Foch? Ok, I'll wait for him near the hotel. Thank you. Strange, but there is no such number here. I see. She lied to you. The address is false. I fear very much for her life. What can we do? She is no prime minister, she doesn't have the right for personal security. Yes, I see. However, I have a dog. What dog? Belgian shepherd. I don't care where to walk it. I can do it under her windows. And I will get the address from a more reliable source. - What is your name? - Jorge. - Andre. Lear, Lear, let's go back. As we communicated earlier, a group of armed terrorists had hijacked the plane, with 260 passengers on board. The plane landed on the territory of a small tropical state. After negotiations with the authorities the terrorists released the majority of passengers, 210 people. On hijackers' request a van was delivered to the plane ladder. The terrorists, hiding behind the rest of the hostages, tried to leave the plane. However, the snipers located on the hangar roof opened fire. 9 of 14 terrorists were killed on the spot. Two died of injuries, one is in the local hospital. Two more managed to escape. The person who was the reason of hijacking and one of his accomplices managed to leave the airport in the van. The authorities take all the measures to detain the criminals. Francoise... It's him. - Who? - Schoerner. I recognized him. - Which Schoerner? - The one that was in prison. I told you about him. Look, they have released him. Now you will see him young. It's not it, it's Roosevelt. On the next day after arriving to Teheran Roosevelt left the American legation and went to the Soviet Embassy. - Why do I need it all? I have been keeping this tape for 35 years. Nobody has ever seen it. All these years I didn't have anybody to share with. Probably that's why I have written these damned memoirs. And aren't you afraid? Of whom? - Of me, for example. - What do you mean? Nothing. No, I am not afraid of you, no. You know, the American legation was situated in quite a big distance from the Soviet and English Embassies. And Stalin suggested that Roosevelt should relocate his residence to the Soviet Embassy. To avoid travelling back and forth. This invitation was based on the Soviet intelligence information that the saboteurs sent to Teheran were preparing, as Stalin put it, an unpleasant incident against the Big Three. Proceed. - Well? - Better, but still badly. You need to shorten it by 10 seconds. Don't nag at him, it's just a rehearsal. When it comes to the reality, he will run faster. Your papers are ready. You leave in the morning. Schoerner is waiting for you. Dennis Pew arrives on Wednesday, between 9 and 11 Teheran time. That's it. He sank. Your cigar. I am closing. They'll be ready tomorrow. - I need my photos in an hour. - I am closing. And overtime pay is thrice more. I'll pay tenfold. And I'll buy the negative. I have heard a lot of flattering things about you. They say you can do miracles. That you can make two completely different people look like twins. They even say that you don't scruple to falsify documents. - What do you need? If we tell you, there will be two options left: or you'll perform the order, or we'll have to eliminate you. Do you understand it? And do you understand, that you need to pay well for the artistic work? I am sure we'll find a common language. Spit it out. The photo that is being developed there must substitute this one. Enough, ok? Okay. - And won't Mr. Dennis Pew be offended? - He is far away. He doesn't care. Well, I'll try to finish this work by morning. If you come about 10 o'clock... - No, we'll sleep here. - You won't be comfortable here. - It's all right, we'll handle it. - All right. - Good morning. - Good morning. - May I speak to you for a moment? - Of course. - The receptionist said you were wondering about me. - Yes, I wanted to see you. - What is it? - I feel awkward about my refusal. I understand what an uncomfortable situation I have put you in. If you need me, tell me, I will be glad to help you. Thank you. Tell them to shut up. Tell them to answer my questions curtly. Only ?yes? or ?no?. Not a single word more. Ask them whether they'll be ready by day 30. Ask again whether he understood my question well. Will they be absolutely ready by day 30, meaning the day after tomorrow? All right, thank you, Marie. I don't need you more. Is it all? Yes, it is. The car will take you to the hotel. Stop, I'm going out here. - Do you know what the funeral agent is doing now? - The funeral agent? Yes. The funeral agent is crawling through barrels now. - How do you know? - I do. Besides, I know that today he is doing better than 5 days ago. Why, is he an idiot? No, you know, I think he is genius. The devil himself wouldn't invent a better way to get into the English Embassy. The thing is that in this city water supply doesn't exist in the same form as in the other places. There are neither pipes nor water-tower here. Here water flows from the mountains through special channels that lie under entire city. The locals call these channels ?ropes?. So, there are these ropes under the English Embassy. The hereditary ?ropemakers? maintain them. A usual person can't get into them and move there without special training. So, these two are the very ?ropemakers? from the English Embassy. - Do you believe in presentiment? - You know that I believe in chance. Yes, chance? It seems to me that the chance is a part of something bigger that we are unaware of. It's like a float on the water surface, and all the main things are in the depth, hidden from us. - Don't worry, Marie. I won't let you be hurt. - Thank you. Andre! Look! - You were right. He's got the guns. - Who brought them? - A stranger came in the cafe with a bag and left without it. - Where's he now? Our people were following him. He's got way. They warned us to stay at our spots and not to leave. Probably they'll come today. So what? You just need to film today, to film and to memorize, that's it. I won't apologize for you being searched and your equipment inspected. Get in the car, please. I suppose that inevitability of the strict security measures is understandable without explanations. Don't leave the car! This is the solemn ceremony of the English King George VI handing a gift for the city of Stalingrad. It was written on the sword's blade: ?To the citizens of Stalingrad, people with hearts of steel, from King George VI as a sign of English people's respect? or something like that. - Listen, Max, why did you get involved in this story? ? Devil knows. This rascal Schoerner dragged me into it. Is coffee ready? - Yes, right away. All three were photographed after the ceremony. It happened on November 29 at 15.30. It's a pity I wasn't there at the time. - What are you doing? You are crazy! - Don't be mad at me, Francoise. You know, I got used to them very much. When they died I had a feeling that I lost my relatives. Then something happened to my nerves, I dream of all sorts of nonsense at night. I know too much about this rascal Schoerner's past. - Are you afraid? - No, I am not. It's not easy to find me now. Let them look for me. No, you are an idiot. Do you know why I opened the wrong door then? - Why? Schoerner told me to worm into your confidence and find it all out. Well, go on, go on. To find out the main thing: where is your manuscript, and your address. Why haven't you done it then? Why? Maybe I took a pity on you. It's not true, you invented it. No, it's all true. - Hello! - Oh, it's you. - Hello, inspector, aren't you fed up? - Of what? - Of sticking around my windows. - Why, do you live here? - I do. - What a coincidence, isn't it? I think, inspector, that you decided to use the services of the information desk after all. No, not at all. I am just walking my dog here. Show yourself! Isn't it a beautiful dog? Do you like it? Why are you silent, inspector? What's wrong? Go away from here! Now! Do you hear? I don't understand, where to? Wait! Get up, hold on to me. Get up... Who is this? You need to go away from here, today. But not during the day, you'll go at night. This woman can hide you in her basement. She'll come here at midnight by taxi. - But I need to see Legrain. - I'll help you, but not today. Go. This is the very day, Churchill's birthday. You know, Francoise, after the war I read several books about this attempt, strangely, some things happened to be truthful in them. But they all had the same mistake: took the false distractive options for the true ones. Nobody could guess there existed one more option - me. It was the only real danger for the Big Three. - Mustafa's atelier. - Got it. - I ask for 5 minutes only. - No. Everything was fine, the camera worked normally, probably something happened during the search. - I can't. - But such events don't happen every day. All right. You have no more than 5 minutes. Thank you. It's on the way, Mustafa's atelier. I have a problem. The camera's broken. Go ahead. Your camera. Wait there. It's all right. It works. - Tell everyone to get out of the car. - Everyone out of the car, please. - How do you do. - How do you do. Put your equipment down. You may smoke. - Mr. Pew? - Yes. - We would like to check your camera. - It's just been checked. - Nevertheless, we'd like to check it once again. - But there's a tape inside. Don't worry, we have a special room for it. Please. All right, let's go. - Open the camera. - All right, but it's too light here, I'll spoil the film. Open the camera. Hands behind your neck! Go! What are you doing here? Why are you smiling? I think you are hungry. - Awfully. - Let's go. Move! Quickly! Quickly! - Do you know what I am thinking about? - No. I think that I am the happiest person in the world. It's strange, isn't it? They wanted to kill me just now, and I am happy. Marie, you need to go away immediately. Understand, we need to part, there's no other way. I can cause you grief, sadness, maybe even death. All right, I'll send you to the countryside for a few days. You'll be safe there. And I'll come for you in 3 days, all right? Let's go. - Madam is leaving us? - Madam will rest in the country for a few days. - My clinic is small. Seat down, please. - Thank you. Exemplary staff, perfect treatment. There aren't many patients, but they are all decent people. Madam has suffered from headaches before, but this night I was really sacred. I think there's nothing to worry about. Madam will stay with us for 2 or 3 days, we'll run the tests, prescribe the treatment course. The nurse will come right away and take Madam to her room. - Madam Lunie? - Yes. - How are you feeling? - I am better, thank you. But I don't know you. - I am sorry, madam, but I've come for you. - Did something happen? They shot at him? At the hotel entrance. Is he? alive? He's wounded. He asked for you to come. Where did you bring me? Where did you bring me? No need to worry. Where are you taking me? - Come in, sit down. - Connected. - Yes, who do you need? - You. Come immediately. Address: Barkhay str., 7. We have madam Lunie. Do you understand what I'm saying? - I don't believe you have her. - Be so kind, say something. - Andre, they want to kill me. I don't know why, but they want to kill me. - Nonsense. They're scaring you. Where are you? - Andre, I wanted to tell you that I love you. - Yes, we will soon go away from here, soon? Where are you? - I don't know, I... Excuse me. It's me again. - Look, I'll pay you well. - We need no money, but you. How soon can you be here: Barkhay,7. No fooling around. - In an hour. - It's too late. - I won't have time. - Try. - Did I get it right: Barkhay,7? - Rascal! I know there's a person there. Hold it. Hold it tight. Gimmi. That's it. Wait now. - Damn it! - What is it? The coat and the hat. - Coat? -Yes. Why hasn't he taken it off? The coat makes it uncomfortable. Andre sent me. Not a sound! Quiet! Yes? What's up? Hide! Halt! Drop the ladder! Hands! Raise your head. Take the hat off. Who are you? - He made me change. Take him! - Grave digger! - Yes! - Why are you late? - There're raids in the city, Mustafa's taken. - Where's the cameraman? - Arrested. - You were supposed to take the film. - I did. There're general arrests in the city. The English and the Russians together with Iranians. You will get up now and follow me. Hello, Andre! Hello, Marie! Hello, Andre! Marie! What are you thinking about? Damned time. Whether there will never be nothing more? Whether everything's over, gone? No, Marie. Everything stayed. The past is as real as all that is happening now, this very moment. The main thing is not to forget. The main thing is memory. Yes, memory. I remember the small shabby hotel where we stayed in Teheran. You know, it is more real for me than this glass of cognac... or that man over there. And I remember the antiques store, Vijaya covered with dust... and your dreams. Oh God, why are we sitting here? We should go to my place. Wait, let me call my daughter. I am her daughter. My name's Natalie. Yes, yes, I remember you. May I sit down? Yes, of course. Excuse me for not offering. You know, she was in the phone cabin and at that moment the truck... The big truck. My mother told me a lot about you. She... repeated her stories dozens of times. I even remember them by heart with all the details. Every... stone on the road, every movement, every sound. These last days she was always remembering the story with dolphins. Of how you were bathing in the sea and didn't notice that the storm started and? dolphins appeared. Dolphins? But we have never been to the sea. Oh my God, this means... she invented it all. Who? We finally met. - So many years passed. Excuse me. - What do you drink? - Beer. What is it? It's them. I like this film very much. I often watch it, sometimes hours in a row. None of them is alive now. They all died a natural death. And I could have killed them. Churchill at Roosevelt's funeral. And this is his own funeral. So, how have you been living all this time? - I lived richly, well off, but this was the life of a worm. Then they called me. Our people found me and called. And you? - No, I didn't betray my business. There was always a demand for assassination, especially a political one. And recently it became so fashionable, that I had to refuse some offers. Didn't have enough time. Then they stopped coming to me. Really, who needs an old man, when there are so many young ones around? Let me go. Let me go, will you? We don't have much time. Let's go. By the way, I wanted to ask you? out of mere curiosity. Where to did you disappear in Teheran from that ?rope?? You were just two steps away from the English Embassy. I am a professional and not a suicide. Already down there, in the well, I understood that I was finished, and escaped through the side track. You know, I still can't understand how they smelled it out about the ?ropes?. Hands! The manuscript. By the way, Mr. Schoerner, now that we have met, I have one question: why did you need to hijack the plane? There was only one month left until your release from prison. If there was even one hour left, I would have released myself on my own anyway, to prove you that we are still strong. - Excuse me, I am waiting for you, sir. - I don't receive today. I am a foreigner, came from far away. It's about the book. I am interested in some details. - There is no manuscript anymore. - But can I meet the author? - There is no author either. He died. - Was he killed? He died. And what about the film? I've seen it in London. There is nothing left. The negative is also destroyed. Well, we have memory left. What do you mean? Memory. A common human memory. It is the most reliable thing of all. Goodbye. Goodbye.
