[MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, that's lovely, isn't it? I'm going to get it for you as soon as we're rich. Oh, darling. I don't really want it. That's all right. I'll get it anyway. We'll come back for it the day after tomorrow. After tomorrow? And what are you going to use as money? Well, what do you mean? We'll have burglarized a villa by tomorrow. Silly! Pardon? Yes, lord and master. I prefer that. Come on. Pardon? Come on, darling? I prefer that. [MUSIC PLAYING] Yes, we'll go inside. But what for? To meet an acquaintance. Who? No one. We're going to pretend. [MUSIC PLAYING] Olives? Again? You're becoming a petty thief. Wait. They are graciously supplied by the cafe. To customers. May I remind you we were looking for customers? But we didn't meet anybody. How could we? Hey, oh, it's sad. There's no one here. We could call a friend. There's nobody we know. In the whole world? In that cafe. But I do have friends, and where we're going to spend the night. All night? Oh, I think so. I'll have to call them first. But if you prefer these nuts here, obtained by the same means. [MUSIC PLAYING] This is pretty cozy. Oh, this is nothing. We'll be cozier by far tonight, you'll see, for that honeymoon we're waiting for. So eagerly. Oh, here is a virgin who wants to stop being a virgin. Hypocrite. Don't try to pretend you don't care. I do care. But we had to find a setting that is right. Oh, not anymore. It doesn't really matter. And why? Because I want you. May I help you? Oh, excuse us. Wait for me. [MUSIC PLAYING] She's a beauty. Yes, a teenager. You don't have to worry. All right. And another thing-- listen. [MUSIC PLAYING] All right, so long. Well? Let's go. What did they say? Oh, no one home yet. But then, you talked to somebody? What? You've been-- you've been listening? No, but I saw you speaking. Oh, but why, that was only the telephone operator. Come on. But there's nobody there. It's all right. It's just you and I. It's our night. We'll see these people later. Is it very far? Not if we get a ride. Let's go. We'll proceed as usual, and try to get a convertible. Very well, sir. [MUSIC PLAYING] Ah, this way. But there's no one home. Who's going to let us in? Uh, this door should be open. See? I told you. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SYMPHONY MUSIC] Does this modest abode suit your royal highness? Hm, ye noble prince taught me a fine term of praise, approval, and contentment-- a classy joint, man. My pretty virgin is learning quite fast. I still have much to comprehend. Oh, but you've done well already by watching last night's exhibition. That's audio visual education. But now, you require practice, which you shall commence right this minute. Andre, don't be vulgar. What you just said is no joke for me. Oh, I'm sorry. Come, then. We're going to celebrate! Would your highness care to move to the bar? What would you have? To begin with, vodka, the best there is-- Smirnoff. If you don't know, we'll try them all. It's strong! ANDRE: Like it? It's whiskey. It's a matter of taste. Some like it, some don't. Well then, here's a cordial you'll love. Right? Here's still another one. Bottoms up. [GAGGING] [COUGHING] Wait, here comes the best of all, the royal blend. Help me get undressed. Come, let's move. Over there, where I may see my lovely girl's nude body more than once. [CLOCK RINGING] But you saw me in the nude on the beach. My beauty queen, you must remember now. We have a place all ours, a setting designed for a perfect honeymoon. You are my bride from Andalucia-- Your bride-- --soon to become all mine, all mine. --from Andalucia. But why don't you marry your bride from Andalucia? Why not get married for real, Andre? Because the matrimony game has become unfashionable, and you want romance, not marriage. Look, we'd need money to be married. You know that, darling. And soon, we'll have money. So now you know there isn't any need to wait. It makes no difference. This is the wedding night we've been waiting for. We've been patient, and now it has come. [MUSIC PLAYING] I want you, Andre. [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh. [MUSIC PLAYING] Ah! Ah! [MUSIC PLAYING] Ah! [MUSIC PLAYING] Ah! Get up! We've gotta get out! Get dressed! Hurry up! But why? ANDRE: Oh, I'll tell you later. Get going! And your friends? Aren't we going to say hello to your friends? Oh, we'll do that some other time. Let's go! Come on, hurry! And with what? With that. And not later than tomorrow, we will be rich. Right now, we'll have to sell this. Andre, you haven't stolen it? You should have told me. Come on. Will you stop worrying? Come on. Tell the truth, please. We didn't see anybody all night, so it's not a present. Well, I'll explain it to you later, over lunch. Don't worry about a thing. Now there's a car coming. Let's make a try for a ride. Tell me, who gave you this object? What is its value? Look here, young man. I won't buy stolen goods. I should promptly call the police. But I have bigger worries. Should anyone ask, I never saw you before. Perhaps it's preferable if I ignore your vile innuendos. This object's my property. I might add, you haven't any damned business offending me and the lady. Are you buying? Hm. Andre, he might call the police. Let's go. Not bad, for you. Many thanks. Oh, wait. I have other objects I wouldn't mind offering up for sale. I'll return tomorrow. Goodbye. Thank you very much. Your check, sir. Thank you. [MUSIC PLAYING] All right, my little princess. I didn't tell you the truth, but not about the candlestick. I do have a confession to make about the house where we've been. It does not belong to friends of mine. It's my home. Yes, I understand. My father and I never got along. And when my mother died, it's he who sent me away. MARIA: Oh, my poor darling. Your father-- then it's because of him that we left this morning in a panic. Listen, Maria. Everything that's in this house that is of any value belonged to my mother. She wanted me to have it. She told me so herself, just before she-- ever since I've had my little wife with me, I've kept thinking. By myself, I didn't give a damn about money. But there are two of us now. I want to take what's mine, at least part of it. Tonight, I'll go back to the house. I don't believe there's any danger. Danger? I'm going with you, then. My brave little princess. Don't call me a princess. Yes, you are. And you are my wife. Your change, sir. There's nobody around, but better play it safe, just in case. [MUSIC PLAYING] Let's go. I'm ready. I'm not. ANDRE: No one knows you. But if you want to-- Oh god, just like in the movies. Careful with my hair. All set. How do I look? Let me see. Sexy and mysterious, just great. You look like an adventurer at Dodge City. [BANG] Let's get going. Yes, sir! Shh! [MUSIC PLAYING] One, two, three. I've won. ANDRE: Shh. Visitors again? There's nobody tonight. The boss isn't going to get home till later. I know that. So then, what is it? Nothing, only the fire in the fireplace in the front room. Wait. I'm going to check anyway. Oh, no. We have to add it up first. I'm sure I win tonight. That's right. This is so exciting. Shh! (WHISPER) Come on! It's nothing. Hands up! [GRUNTING] You halfwit! You don't remember your own home. It looks as if my father's changed things around. Oh? (WHISPER) Come on. This is it. (WHISPER) That's too big. I'll use the other bag. Hold this one. [MUSIC PLAYING] Shh! Oh, there's no one around. Listen. It's pretty. Hands up, you! [GASPING] Wait. Hey, this is great. A baby doll for me and you. And what's more, apprehended in the act of burglary. Let us have a little peek. Mm, not bad. Mm, not bad at all. Just what the doctor ordered. For immediate consumption. What are we waiting for? No! Ah! [GASPING] Hm, what a cute little behind, almost as crisp and firm as that of a boy. There shouldn't be any leftovers. Don't give me any trouble, silly. You'd better submit. Don't fight back now, or it'll be the police. That's more like it. She's waiting to serve you. Oh, please. After you. Not me, thanks. I don't play with girls. I'd almost forgotten. Ah! What'll I do with my rifle? [GRUNTING] Get off! Andre! [CRASH] Son of a bitch! Too bad. But we have better things to do. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GRUNTING] [CRYING] Ah! Ah! [MUSIC PLAYING] [MOANING] Why not give it a try? Yeah, why shouldn't I? It'll be an exception. But my way-- go on, turn her around. Now, wait a minute. What's going on? Please, sir. We were fortunate enough to catch this young person with a man in the act of burglary. And this is their loot. The man escaped. And you took advantage of it and raped the girl? Don't blame me, sir. I know that. As for you, get out. And don't ever come back. Take this and go to the fireplace, or you'll catch a cold. Much obliged, Mister. That's quite all right. You may go. If I need you, I ring. Thank you, sir. Sit down. Who are you? Look, Miss, you can't afford being insolent. You forget you have been caught in the act of burglary. Your name for it is burglary? And what's your name for it? Reclaiming our part. Your part? Your part of what? Oh, which belongs to Andre, and which you've taken. I'm going to marry Andre tomorrow. MAN: You want to marry this burglar? The burglar is your own son! You want to be married to my son Andre? And don't imagine you can prevent this marriage. You've harmed us enough as it is. Andre is of age. He loves me, and I love him. Let's assume this to be true. But tell me, why did this young man run away and leave you to your fate? You can't tell me why. And he told you that all this is his, right? No, only half, just his mother's property, when you threw him out. Now listen, young lady, and look straight into my eyes. I don't know what the young man told you about me, but I give you my word of honor. He is not my son. I never had a son. That's just unbelievable. You mean that none of these things are Andre's? And we would have robbed you if they hadn't caught the both of us? What stops you from having me arrested? Go ahead, call the police! We have plenty of time. Sit down. What's your name? Maria de Ortega. Spanish? Part Spanish. My mother is French. Hm. And how did you meet this young man? You should tell me. Why? There is a reason. You'll find out a little later. Do tell me, please. Where did you live? Was it Madrid? No. It was in a lovely little town. MAN: What's it called? You wouldn't know it. MAN: Tell me anyway. Come on, please. [INAUDIBLE],, on the south coast. MAN: Oh, I know. There's a beautiful church overlooking the-- [CHURCH BELLS] MARIA (VOICEOVER): It's a beautiful church. I used to go to mass there every Sunday with my father. MAN (VOICEOVER): And your mother? MARIA (VOICEOVER): Oh, no. She had to stay home and cook our Sunday dinner, whether she liked it or not. She was afraid of father. Everybody was. I was never permitted to go out alone, except of course to go to school, and sometimes to shop for dinner to help mother. The only chance I had to walk through the city was with my father on those Sundays, to church and back. But he never spoke to me, except to give the orders. Outside of school, I was forbidden to have any contact with young people of my age, or even to show any interest in what goes on between a boy and a girl. It's on the way home from church that I saw Andre for the first time. [MUSIC PLAYING] My father didn't notice a thing. One wasn't supposed to talk during the meal, except if father asked you a question. And we had to wait for his permission to clear the table. The atmosphere in our house was that of a monastery. [BELL RINGING] Fortunately, I had a friend and ally-- an accomplice, in fact-- our maid. Without Concita, I would never have known that children were not brought by the stork. Her little signal meant that she had something to tell me. To have a few minutes alone with her, I offered to go and help her wash the dishes. It was not as simple as that. Usually, my father was against it. He always said, "My daughter is not a servant." But on that particular Sunday, my mother dared to contradict him. "She'll have to learn to be a perfect housewife," she said, "to please the husband you'll select for her." And father said, "All right." [MUSIC PLAYING] Every time we managed to be alone together, Concita gave me a complete report on her most recent love affairs. She had plenty of them. Her room was on the ground floor, and she climbed through the window almost every night, after everyone in the house had gone to sleep. Her latest lover had been especially passionate-- wide shoulders, narrow waist, so handsome. Mm! First they'd gone to a dance where he'd squeezed and hugged her with tender force. Later on, when they were alone, he kissed her all over. And finally, he bit her. Yes! He bit her! Not once, but all over. Mind you, really all over. She loved it. In fact, she was so proud of it, Concita. I was confused, and strangely thrilled. [MUSIC PLAYING] Me too, I had breasts. Me too, I had the body of a woman. [MUSIC PLAYING] How often did I imagine myself in the arms of a man, yielding to his desire, just like Concita? But for the first time since that morning, my imaginary lover had a face that I could recognize. [MUSIC PLAYING] I had lots of homework to do. I had to prepare myself for an exam to be admitted to a finishing school which my father had selected for me. But I was unable to concentrate. I kept thinking about my wonderful encounter that morning. And I was haunted by Concita's vivid description of her latest adventure. In those magazines that Concita used to read and pass on to me, the man who tried to seduce the girl was always the villain. And he was always punished for having made love with the girl. According to Concita, however, the men who made love with her were certainly not villains. On the contrary, in those picture magazines, the hero was wooed the girl with gifts and flowers. And the story ended with a kiss and a marriage proposal. There were so many questions I had to ask about all these things, but there was no one to answer them. My mother? No, all she'd say was, "Wait till we find you a husband. He'll explain everything." All her motherly love consisted of was stuffing me full of food. Had I obeyed her, I'd be as fat as a pig. As for father, had he been able to read my thoughts, he'd have strangled me. He wanted to help me, though, and he often did, in my homework. But it's not for math or Latin that I needed his advice. That day, in fact, he seemed satisfied with my work. Had he been a real father, this would have been the perfect time for a heart-to-heart talk. But I'd never dare to broach any of the questions that were on my mind. [MUSIC PLAYING] The following day was Concita's day off. Mother didn't feel well, and I was the one to do the shopping for the day. [MUSIC PLAYING] I loved those rare moments of independence. All I had on my mind was Andre. And I was going to take advantage of this opportunity to make a detour through the street where I'd seen him for the first time the day before, if only I could see him again, just one more time. [MUSIC PLAYING] I had lost him, the man of my dreams. I knew nothing about him, not even his name. I was sure I'd never see him again. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GASPING] I don't get it. [GASPING] That's mine! Sure, but for a young lady, it's much too heavy. So let me help you carry it, all right? [MUSIC PLAYING] My name is Andre. Mine's Maria. Maria de Ortega, I know. But how do you know? I made inquiries. What for? Oh, because uh-- well, wait just a moment. Here, give me that. But I'm quite able to carry it myself. No, because you're going to need both of your arms to bear a burden of another kind. Another kind? What? Princess, this is for you. But why the flowers? To prove I care for you. And to seduce you, later. I'll see you tonight at the foot of the church stairs. [MUSIC PLAYING] MARIA (VOICEOVER): He told me that he'd cared for me, and that he would seduce me later, seduce me to make love with him. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GASPING] Oh! [GASPING] MARIA (VOICEOVER): Lovers usually were together on a bed. That much I knew. But on a bed, one doesn't wear any clothes. It was hard for me to imagine myself nude in front of Andre, who obviously had to be naked himself. [MUSIC PLAYING] My room was one flight up, much too high to jump through the window. And I certainly couldn't have used the main entrance. My father would have heard me. There was one solution-- to climb through the window of Concita's room on the ground floor. Concita was only too glad to be of help, to become my accomplice for my first date. But she disapproved of the way I was dressed. "Much too prudish," she said. She wanted me to wear her clothes. Above all, she objected to my slacks. "Men hate girls in slacks," she insisted. "They don't want their road of access to be obstructed." Concita always wore skirts on her dates. And underneath the skirt, she wore nothing at all. I didn't have the heart to disappoint her by telling her I had no intention of giving myself to a man that night. But nonetheless, I did take her advice about the slacks and selected a skirt, a lovely gypsy skirt that covered my legs all the way down to the ankles. He had told me that he would be waiting for me at the foot of the church stairs. [MUSIC PLAYING] Andre introduced me to his friends. They were all about my age. Andre was the oldest. I envied them. They seemed so happy, because they were free. Pass the bottle! Yeah. [MUSIC PLAYING] There were a few girls there, too, but I was the one Andre had chosen. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CHOKING] [LAUGHTER] [MUSIC PLAYING] - So long! - Good bye. See you. MARIA (VOICEOVER): We walked and walked all night, until sunrise. [MUSIC PLAYING] The time has come for a midnight swim down below, at 5:00 in the morning. But I can't. I didn't bring a bathing suit. That's all right, me neither. In this cold water? Come, senorita. You can't remain all dressed with a naked man right in front of you. [MUSIC PLAYING] You're beautiful, Maria. [MUSIC PLAYING] See? I think you were right, senorita. It's much too cold. Yes. Let's go back up and get warm. Now, see? It feels better already, doesn't it? Mm-hm. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GASPING] Andre, a while ago when you kissed me, no man had ever kissed me before. You've never met a man alone before tonight? Believe me. And no man has ever made love to you? Oh, yes. In my dreams. Love must be real. You must live it. Your dreams are coming true. No, Andre! Please. Don't be angry. This is not the way I'd pictured my first night of love. You must forgive me. [MUSIC PLAYING] You're very angry. And you're right, too. I behaved like a jerk. But remember, my dreams are made of romance. And you're part of my dreams. Don't go yet, my pretty virgin. Don't go. You have opened my eyes to romance. Almost from the second that I met you, my lovely little princess, I knew you were like no one else. Come with me to France. I have friends there whose beautiful house should be the right setting for our first night together. And it's you who will decide when it should take place. I'm glad, Andre. I'd like to be yours for all time. But it's impossible. I'd need my parents' permission. [MUSIC PLAYING] Maria, think about it. I'll wait for you every night until Thursday at the same place. Don't forget. My parents love me. I have to stay with them, Andre. I'll wait for you anyway! Huh? Ah! Ah! [CRYING] Ah! Ah! [CRYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] MARIA (VOICEOVER): The next evening, Andre did wait for me at the foot of the church stairs, just as he said he would. We had walked all night. [MUSIC PLAYING] We were starved, but Andre had no money left. Lucky, Concita had thought of everything. Amidst the skirt she'd given me as a farewell present, she had slipped my piggy bank. [MUSIC PLAYING] We bought some mineral water and some bread. There was a dessert, too-- apples. [MUSIC PLAYING] Our first meal on the road was wonderful. I was so happy. We were going to use the remainder of my savings for a bus. We were certain that my father had notified the police, and it was essential for us to get across the border as quickly as possible. In fact, that was the reason for our trying to catch the bus on the highway instead of waiting for it at a regular bus stop, where we might have been questioned. [MUSIC PLAYING] One needs identity papers to cross the border between one country and another, and of course I didn't have any. Besides, I was underage, and minors need parental permission in writing to travel abroad. But we decided anyway to take a close look. [MUSIC PLAYING] The crossing point was well guarded. [MUSIC PLAYING] There were guides who smuggled people across the border. We didn't have any money to pay for such service, but Andre knew one of them, and we got some free advice about the best road across the mountains. [MUSIC PLAYING] It was cold in the mountains that night, my first night in the arms of Andre. [MUSIC PLAYING] The next morning, we had made it to France. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GIGGLING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [LAUGHING] [MUSIC PLAYING] We were anxious to get to the south of France as quickly as possible. Our only means of traveling was hitchhiking. [MUSIC PLAYING] I had no experience to speak of, but I was eager to learn. [MUSIC PLAYING] [LOWING] We made our way south in easy stages. We slept in barns, with or without the permission of the farmer. I was in love a little bit more every day and every night, being as close together as we were, Andre and I. What's the matter? Too warm for you? Andre, let's not wait any longer. Come, darling. Now-- Oh no we don't, my passionate princess of Andalucia. Not here. We wait till St. Tropez. You were right all along. Our wedding night shall be beautiful. All right? All right, till St. Tropez. [MUSIC PLAYING] MARIA (VOICEOVER): I was still a virgin, and we had nothing to eat. No, that was not the way I'd imagined my honeymoon trip with the man of my dreams. And I was beginning to wonder, what was I doing there on those unfriendly roads? The Mediterranean coast was sunny, at least. But we were as hungry as before. Andre's drawings on the sidewalks of Marseilles did not attract much attention. [MUSIC PLAYING] I hadn't even been able to collect enough coins to buy some cheese or sausage to put on our bread. [MUSIC PLAYING] Not much business, pal, is there? The message is the only thing I care about. But what about food? Oh, I manage. See you around. [MUSIC PLAYING] MARIA (VOICEOVER): St. Tropez at last. Andre was in a hurry to contact his friends whose invitation had started us on our trip. Of course, he had to phone them first and announce our arrival. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm not getting any reply. They have a new number, maybe. I'll go there and find out. Let's go, then. Oh no, no. I've got to go there by myself. But why? And where-- where am I supposed to wait? Don't worry. MARIA (VOICEOVER): Andre realized the reasons for my distress. After all, we hadn't been separated for a single moment ever since we left Spain. He reassured me and promised that he wouldn't be long. I should wait for him at a place on a hilltop overlooking St. Tropez, where a group of young people-- some of them his friends-- lived community fashion. I didn't quite know what that meant. [MUSIC PLAYING] Come over here. Come sit down. Thanks. MARIA (VOICEOVER): They were young people from all over the world, attracted by the sunny climate of the Mediterranean, who had decided to live together. [BARKING] Want some? Go ahead. [MUSIC PLAYING] Don't you want some coffee? There, just inside. Thanks. See you. [MUSIC PLAYING] You want some? Here. Mm. [MUSIC PLAYING] Thanks. It's good? Yeah? You staying? A while. [MUSIC PLAYING] MARIA (VOICEOVER): The boy who had poured the coffee for me was nice. His name was Yen. He'd taken me under his wing and introduced me to everyone in the room. [MUSIC PLAYING] There were artists and craftsmen, musicians and carpenters, designers, seamstresses, and many others. [MUSIC PLAYING] Yen explained to me that they were not like the hippies I had heard about, but working people who shared their earnings and everything else they had. In fact, they practiced in their day-to-day lives the love thy neighbor rule our parish priest was talking about every Sunday. [MUSIC PLAYING] The community was getting ready for the night. [MUSIC PLAYING] Andre hadn't returned yet, but thanks to Yen, the time hadn't seemed too long. I liked his company. He made me feel good. [MUSIC PLAYING] Go on, have some. Mother's milk. [MUSIC PLAYING] [COUGHING] [MUSIC PLAYING] You obviously aren't used to it. MARIA (VOICEOVER): All around me, boys and girls were finding each other. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MOANING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MOANING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Never, not even in the most daring of my dreams-- [MUSIC PLAYING] [MOANING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MOANING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MOANING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MOANING] [MOANING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MOANING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MOANING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [GASPING] Ah! Ah! [MOANING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MOANING] [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm sorry. No one told me, man. [MOANING] And our wedding night we planned so carefully? You forgot about it? Don't be mad, Andre. Andre. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MOANING] [MUSIC PLAYING] MARIA (VOICEOVER): I had what I deserved. I had lost Andre. I'd been caught in the web of Yen's beautiful words and carried away by the sight of loving without restraint. I had been under the influence of what I'd been drinking and of these strangely sweet-smelling little cigarettes. [MUSIC PLAYING] I don't know how long I'd been asleep. When I woke up, Andre was with me. He told me that it was jealousy, seeing me the arms of Yen, that made him go off with the blonde to avenge himself. He asked me to forget that incident. He was sorry. Andre was jealous! And he had asked me to forgive him. He loved me! He'd been able to contact his friends. Everything was all set for the following evening. All he had to do was call them shortly before he were to arrive. Andre. Andre, I don't want to wait. I want to be yours. [MUSIC PLAYING] MARIA (VOICEOVER): I was happy. I hadn't lost Andre. [MUSIC PLAYING] In the morning, we left our belongings at the community and walked around St. Tropez all day. We had lots of fun. [MUSIC PLAYING] Late afternoon, Andre tried to reach his friends to announce our arrival. That was yesterday. Yes, I know. I was the one Andre spoke to. But then, you were at home. MAN: Well, yes and no. But this has to be explained. You should explain it. Andre says this is his home here. Only would he lie? MAN: You're so naive, my child. You're going too far. There must be some truth in what he told me. But what could have been Andre's motive in coming here tonight? MAN: He came to rob me. Yes, but is it so awful to rob one's own property? Because it is his property! But the only thing that really matters is I love him. Last night was so beautiful. Yes, I know. What do you mean? Explain. There was too much strain for you today. You need a rest. [BELL RINGING] You must stay here tonight. We'll talk again tomorrow, and much will become clear to you then. And Andre? How will I ever find him again? I promise you will see him again. Will you take the young lady to the bedroom? I beg your pardon, sir? You heard me. The bedroom. Yes, sir. It's all right. You have nothing to worry about. Good night. If I may be of any service to you, kindly press that button. For your breakfast tomorrow morning, do ring twice, if you please. Tea or coffee? What did you say? Tomorrow morning, tea or coffee? Oh, coffee, if you please. Thank you very much. Maybe I could personally express to you my regrets for what has occurred. I don't appreciate females anyhow. But your case is, I thought, exceptional. It is, in short, a compliment to your design. May I wish you a pleasant night? [KNOCKING] Yes? MAN: I've come to see if you have everything you need. I'll be away all day tomorrow. But I repeat, you have nothing to fear anymore in my house. My servant will get your clothes back in shape by tomorrow. In the meantime-- --you may use this. Good night. MARIA: Please, don't mind my question, sir. I'm at a loss. I don't understand why you're so kind to me. If Andre isn't your son, I'm just a thief who broke into your house. All right. I'll explain. As I told you, I have no son. But I have a daughter. She ran away with the first man she ever met, just as you did. She was your age, then. Why did she do it? Now that you've told me your story, I understand. I should have been a trusted friend to her. Instead, my only interest was my business and my pleasure. And it still is. And she grew up a lonely girl, like you did. This is her room. This is her room. And this is she. I-- I don't even know if she's dead or alive. That's all. I'll see you tomorrow evening in my study. I wish you a pleasant night. Same to you. Shall I put out the light? Please do, sir. [MUSIC PLAYING] Good evening. How nice of you to come. Good to see you. You know where the bar is. I like this place very much. Yes. It's good to see you. Good evening. This is Anita. She is lovely. Hello. [INAUDIBLE] Oh, there they are. Good evening. Good evening, miss. Sorry I'm late. I just got back a few moments ago, almost at the same time as my guests. I'm giving you a little party tonight. Sit down, please. I hope you had a good rest. Thank you, yes. Good, because you need all your strength later on. I have been thinking a lot about you, Maria. I may call you Maria? Are you in shape to take a lesson that will hurt you, a lesson for your own good? Sometimes a tooth should be pulled, even without anesthesia. If, in fact, you do trust me-- I trust you. I do hope that this trust won't be shaken by what I'm going to tell you now. Nobody is perfect. Everybody has his shortcomings. Some people are gluttons, others kleptomaniacs or prone to violence or whatever. I have a weakness too. I am fond of shows, a certain kind of show. You will understand later on. I have many friends who share my inclinations. Some are my guests tonight at my party. It has started already. Now, come with me. [MUSIC PLAYING] [RATTLING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [CHIME] [MUSIC PLAYING] MARIA (VOICEOVER): The other night, that blond girl. Andre! She thinks she's in front of a mirror, just as I did the other night. It's the same mirror-- a one-way mirror. [MUSIC PLAYING] I was the one the other night who was the star of this show. And I didn't know it. [MUSIC PLAYING] My love, my first night of love, was being used to stimulate all these people, these same people. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MOANING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MOANING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MOANING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MOANING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Why did you show me? Just to enjoy my suffering? MAN: A rotten tooth has to be pulled, even if it hurts unbearably. MARIA: You're a sadist. Eh, maybe. Yes. But this pain is for your own good. You'll get over it soon, and you'll be grateful to me for having brought you back to your senses. I am sure of it. [RINGING] Yes? Good, we are waiting for you. It's your father. He's just arrived. I had a long talk with him on the telephone. He has recognized his mistakes, just as I have seen mine, thanks to you. Everything will get back to normal. Your father knows what was wrong before. He'll take you home. You will be a happy little girl from now on. But now you'd better go back up to your own. Andre will be here any moment to get paid. I'll stay. All right. It might be even better that way. But under one condition-- come along. Sit down there. Good evening. Well, my dear sir, satisfied? Weren't they something, those babes? Did you prefer the blond one? Lascivious, huh? Or the other? Adorable, innocent, and pure-- and a genuine virgin. My best presentation. I outdid myself. Your guests must have a blessed you, huh? All right, all right. If you don't want to laugh, don't. You loathe me. I came to collect my fees, after which I'll be off. Normal for tonight, and twice as much for the sweetheart two nights ago. And what were you doing here last night? ANDRE: Just trying to get a little bonus for my girl and myself. You don't pay much for the service I render. As for you, I knew you wouldn't be there. I didn't expect to run into your flunkies. And I had to get out fast. Like a coward, leaving your girlfriend in the hands of my servants. Ah, but you may know it for a fact that if I am facing a loaded shotgun, I can be harmed by it. Pretty girls, however, possess a special currency which is an effective deterrent. To this girl who is in love with me and whom I love myself, a live coward is more attractive than a dead hero. You don't know what love is, do you? You're sickening. You pretend to love the woman whose love you exhibit for money. Me and most of my partners don't care. We're being paid for making love in public. My little virgin, though, shouldn't know ever. She's different. I would be very mad. In fact, what's happened to her? Here. Get out. No. Mr. Whitson, I want twice as much, or I'm going to tell the police what's happening here. Blackmail? Get out! Get out! I'll kill you! Hey, Mr. Whitson, I believe that's pretty cheap for my first performance. I didn't want her to find out, you lecher! [GRUNTING] [GUNSHOT] Ah! You tried to kill me? My pretty wife from Andalucia. Give it to me. Did I kill Andre? No. We have to call an ambulance. You shouldn't be found here. Go up to your room. Your father will join us when he arrives. I heard a shot go off. Anything bad? He tried to kill me with his knife. I had to defend myself. Call an ambulance, quick. Come on. Go to your room. Try to get some rest. Your father will be here any moment. [MOANING] [MUSIC PLAYING] My friends, I apologize for interrupting. For reasons beyond my control, our party has to come to a conclusion. [GROANING] Really, I'm sorry. What happened? Nothing to worry about, I assure you. And again, my apologies. Oh, well. Well, we'll have to continue at the house. [MUSIC PLAYING] How do you do? She's upstairs. I'll show you to her room. And take her home right away. Thank you for everything. I'm sorry I have to leave you. [HORN HONKING] First door on your left. Nothing bad, I hope? Oh, no. An accident of no importance. Come on. There. [KNOCKING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Thank God. [MUSIC PLAYING] Yes, miss? I should go with him. I'm his wife. Then this way, Madam. [HORN HONKING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Thank you for coming. It was nice anyway. See you soon again. Oh no, I didn't think you were going to like this. So long, Mary. You're lovely. Perhaps another time. That's right. Thank you. Goodnight. Thank you. [MUSIC PLAYING]
