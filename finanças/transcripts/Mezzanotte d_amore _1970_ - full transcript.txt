Come home! The tailor is here. He wants you to try on your wedding suit. Did you forget? You're getting married tomorrow. No. I only said goodbye to the sea, to bachelorhood and to my friends. Hurry up! Come on! What kind of sailor are you? Here I am. But let's see what sort of runner you are. Let's see who gets home first! Come on, Pietro! I'm getting ahead! Catch me! How can I catch you? We're going uphill. Andrea, slow down! Ouch! Goddamnit! Forgive me, Holy Mary. Andrea! Wait, Andrea! Mom prepared a huge suitcase full of stuff for you. Twelve pairs of everything. Socks, handkerchiefs, towels, girdles… -What else? -I'll tell you later. -Andrea is getting married! -Thank you! -Andrea is getting married! -Congratulations! -Mom put 12 sheets in the suitcase. -Thank you. No, those are Carmelina's. And then the long woolen underpants, because it'll be cold on your honeymoon. -Andrea is getting married! -Who cares! How rude! What bad manners! She's so beautiful! -She's so beautiful. -Yes, she is. -You're magnificent, Rosetta. -Thank you. -Congratulations, Donna Rosa! -Thank you! -Congratulations! -Thank you. Rosetta, you're so beautiful! Donna Rosa, you are magnificent too. Thank you. Where's your father? Today Don Antonio is here in a double role, as the bride's father and my groom. He was behind us with his car. He won't be late. -Here he is! -I'm coming, Rosa! I'm coming! Here I am. Sorry if I'm late. Forgive me, please. I had a rather inconvenient accident. -I'm sorry, Rosa. -Fortunately, nothing bad happened. Rosetta. My child. Rosetta. You're so beautiful. You look like a fairy. Congratulations. May you have all you desire. -Thanks, Dad. -Congratulations to you, too, Andrea. Thanks. Congratulations to you too, Dad. Thanks, my kids. -Shall we go, gentlemen? -Let's go, Mom. -Come, I'll accompany you. -Thank you, Giorgio. Everyone follow me, and careful with the train. -Come on! -My gosh! You always fall! Let's hurry! Come on! -Where is he? -There. In the countess's chapel. Hail Mary Finally Don Antonio is marrying Donna Rosa. Virtuous shining sun He's so handsome. He looks like a prince. It's true. He is a prince! And we are his vassals. Of our Sweet Lord Jesus Look, what a nice couple Andrea and Miss Rosetta are! They sing hymns of love The saints unite their voices Full of emotion in a suave chorus The pious people Invoke you and pray Bowing Before a thousand altars Hail Mary Domine vobiscum. Do you want to take Rosa De Barberis as your wife? I do. Do you want to take Antonio Di Belmonte as your husband? I do. Do you want to take Rosetta Di Belmonte as your wife? I do. Do you want to take Andrea Calise as your husband? -I do. -Be happy. May I have a word with you? Sure. What is it? Did you just get married? -Yes. -Look, I have this lovely necklace -for your wonderful wife. -Beautiful! -I wonder how much it costs. -The lady has a good eye. -It's worth 100,000. -Woah, I can't spend 100,000 lire. Hey, I said it's worth 100,000. I won't have you pay 100,000. -For you, 70,000 lire. -Do you like it? -Yes. -Thirty-five thousand. -Sixty thousand. -Forty thousand. Fifty thousand. This is a deal you'll remember on your golden anniversary. Okay, then. It's a deal. Is he the man who sold you this necklace for 50,000 lire? Yes. At the Porta Portese marketplace. Very well. Take him away. -So, we can go? -No, unfortunately. Why not? We didn't know it was stolen. We lost 50,000 lire. What else do you need from us? I need to know if you were aware of its value. Yes. It's very beautiful. In a jewelry shop it would probably cost twice as much. More like… 500,000 lire. -Really? -These are real pearls. Aside from the heedless purchase, the police chief will have to establish your good faith. Only the police chief can do that. Her name is Donna Rosa Dear, beautiful Are you ready, dear? Yes, but don't come in so abruptly. How should I come in? Slowly. I must get used to the idea of living with you. Oh, darling. Is this all right? What is it? Do I frighten you? -Am I a Martian or what? -No. I'm sorry. You reminded me of my late husband. He would always enter peeking in like that. Rosa, you stunted me. I didn't need to hear about your late husband. I know, but you must understand. After him, you're the first man who comes into this room. I see. -As of tomorrow I won't mention him again. -As of tomorrow? What about tonight? I get easily upset. What if the Count's ghost comes and scratches my feet, tonight? Why? He can't. He's not supposed to. He said he would only do that if I ended up marrying a commoner. -But you're noble. -You think? Hey, you're meant to say that. Are you noble or not? Of course I am. The documents are authentic. Antonio Di Belmonte, Prince of Roccafestina. Then you have nothing to be afraid of. Plus, he died in India a long time ago, bitten by a snake. The news took three months to reach here. Do you think he'd get here that quickly tonight? -Well, the deceased fly. You know it. -Antonio. Enough talking about him. Think about me. You're right, my Rosa. Our great love can't wait, Rosa. Come. Come, darling. Let's dive into this. -Don't hesitate. -I can't help hesitating. Come on! Why? You can do that! What difference does it make, one hesitation more or one less? Come, darling! Et voilà! See? I even broke the bed. Don't worry. I'll take care of it, now. I'll fix everything with my lion's strength. Nothing serious, dear. The foot has slipped off. -What? -A leg of the bed. These ancient beds… Darling, aren't you coming to bed? Come to sleep, my love. Come, Rosa. Be brave. I'm shy. I feel like I'm a young girl again. Yes. I feel like a young man too, but I don't blush. -Love, come to bed. Please. -Yes, but turn off the light. Yes, darling. I'll turn everything off. Heater, light, gas, everything. I'll create a life-long short circuit. There you go. Love. So? Aren't you coming to sleep? Darling. You are the darling of your Roccafestina. Beautiful. What is it? That's quite rude. My late husband cried on our first night. Someone's tickling my feet. Your late husband is scratching my feet. Don't be silly. Nobody is here. Maybe, but I felt him scratching my feet. -No. -Rosa, I'm scared. So scared. -What? See? You too, now. -It's true! He scratched my feet, too. You see? Then it's him! The count's ghost is here! -Antonio, the nemesis! -What? -Is it a bad thing? -It's his revenge! No! What did I do? Rosa! Rosa! Rosa, it's our wedding night! My goodness. What's wrong? -Oh, my God. He materialized. -It's him. My husband. It's me. You knew that if you didn't marry a nobleman, I would come and scratch your feet. But I am noble. I'm the prince of Roccafestina. I have the documentation! I have the certificate! And now I'm having a heart attack. But the papers are in order. Rather, are you dead or alive? I'm alive. I'm alive. -What's he doing? -Touch! -Touch! Touch! -I'm scared. -He's alive! -Antonio, turn on the light! Antonio. Turn on the light! No, not the beard. Not the beard! No! -Rosa! -He's so ugly. Come into the arms of your groom who has risen from the dead. -What? -I can't. What? Betrayed on my wedding night? -I am the legitimate husband! -Me! Me! No! I am the legitimate husband. I was here first! So, wasn't the snake poisonous? I made up the snake story. To avoid creditors. The dead don't pay taxes! What a scoundrel. Is that clear? I came back because I know everything. World news and gossip of all kinds reach India too. I knew you were going to marry the prince! Help. Someone! Francesco! -Francesco! -I'll call Francesco! -Me too! -No. Me! Francesco! -Francesco! -Francesco! -Francesco! -Yes, Count? Who is it? Francesco Giuseppe? Oh no. The butler behind the bed on our wedding night. -You are fired! -You can't do that. I only take orders from the count. He's my real boss. It's a plot, then. I suppose you were in cahoots with him. -Me? -Yes. She hit me. Why, Rosa? Hey, Prince, I'll beat you black and blue if you don't respect me. I'm the one who is in trouble, here! In fact, you know what? I'll go sleep in the guest room. So you two can argue all you want. Francesco! -Francesco! -Francesco! Starting again? I'm the one calling Francesco. Yes, Countess? -Why? -You were hiding behind the bed. Okay? I'm happy about it. She hit you too. Andrea! -Rosetta, what is it? -I'm scared. -Don't be scared. I'm here. -What if there are mice? Keep talking. Stamp your feet. If there are mice, they'll leave. Silence! Who are you? In your love songs When the sun sets in autumn Will you Remember me? Who are You? You walk on wet sands From the sea of my desires Looking for me For every star that falls In a faraway universe One thought remains Maybe I will find you Who are you? I walk on wet sands From the sea of my desires Looking for you Who are you Who in your faraway dreams In a time that is now the future Will Kiss me? As butterflies with flowers As a heart that loves So tenderly Like I I will love you Who are You? Go, madam. Andrea. Madam. Madam, let's go, now. Go back to your cell. Come on, don't make me angry. Madam! -It's our wedding night. -That's too bad. Glorious Saint Gennaro. Help me. Do a miracle. Undo the knot that ties me to two men. I'm not a ménage à trois type, nor a foursome type. I'm honest and God fearing. You take care of it. You get that, Saint Gennaro? Amen. -Good morning. -Why are you here? -A gift of flowers. -You could've spared it. -You look unhappy. -Who says so? -Your face. -You are furious. I am as I am, okay? Give me the flowers and go away. These are for the countess. To your beauty. -Francesco! -Give me my flowers! -Francesco! -My flowers! My flowers! -Isn't the countess in there? -There's no countess in there. -Who is he? -I'll explain. The Indian… You must know that he came all the way from India for me. -Really? -Got that? Tell me. If instead of organizing a party, I went on a honeymoon… -I must apologize. -Forget it. On the contrary, thank you for your kind hospitality. -But be careful, next time. -All right. Let's go, Rosetta. Come. Look. Andrea and Rosetta sent it to me, from Rome. When you'll have the good fortune of becoming my wife, I'll take you right here. On a honeymoon like your brother? Yes, of course! Our love must follow all the rules. -Will you be a sailor too? -No, never. My father was a sailor and so was my brother. I'll break the family tradition. And Andrea isn't a sailor anymore, either. Don Antonio, Prince of Roccafestina, gave him his antiques workshop as a wedding gift. By the way, just to get an idea, what sort of workshop does your father have? My father doesn't have a workshop. He's an ambassador. That's okay, too. It means that when we get married he'll give me the embassy. Now give me the engagement kiss here. Rosy, come play with me! Yes. I'm coming! You can't trust women. Would you like something else? Fruit, coffee, ice-cream? No, nothing, thanks. I think you're right. Let's pay the bill and leave. -Yes, please. -Waiter. -Yes, sir? -The bill, please. The bill is always ready. My God, I hope you didn't forget your wallet at the hotel. No, Rosita. I had it with me when we bought the postcards. -It must have got stolen. -What do we do now? I spent all the money I had in my purse. We can't leave. I had all my money in my wallet. -No money, sir? -Unfortunately not. -Did they rob it? -Yes, exactly. -Don't worry, sir. -No? Thank you. They are very kind, here. -I'll give you my hotel address. -Don't worry, sir. -This way. -He'll take us to the owner. -Very kind of him. -Please. Really kind. How can one speak badly of the Chinese? Another 200 lire. -Did you finish cleaning the horse? -Don Andrea adores this horse. -Bless you. -Thanks. -Is it you? -Who else? -It's not the horse? -What horse? Let's hurry up! We must clean the whole shop. Okay. We'll take a minute. Your finger stuck in the ladder. I knew it. Don't move, every time you make a mess. Don't move. You make things worse. Don't move. The phone. See who's on the phone. -Hello? -Give it here. Let me talk. You only mess things up. You can't talk on the phone. Hold on. Hello? Hello? Don Andrea, it's you! Oh, yes, yes! Ouch! My hand! My hand is stuck in the ladder! Is your lady okay? All good with Mrs. Rosetta? Tell me. Gennarino, listen to me. Send me 200,000 lire right now. Two hundred thousand lire. Okay, we'll send it by mail. Don't worry. Yes, I'm glad you're having fun! We're not having fun at all. All kind of things happened to us. -Oh no. Really? -Yes. They arrested us. They robbed us. They even sent us to forced labor. So, did you understand? Send the money immediately. Okay. Knock on wood and don't worry. I'll send the money now. Don't worry. Make sure you don't break anything. They're all valuable pieces. Don't worry. We won't break anything. We're like two feathers. Goodbye. I told him we won't break anything. We are like two feathers. Let's be careful. Don't move. Stop. Don't move. -You must hold still. -Be careful! -I'll be damned! We are done for! -Luckily nothing got broken. Good morning. -Please. -Please. -Sit down. -Thank you. Excuse me, Count. The days go by and the situation becomes more and more unacceptable. Shall we deal with it in a friendly manner and find a solution? What's the rush? I didn't come from India on a plane. I hitchhiked, took a train, and then a ship. Let me rest for a week, at least. Then we'll see. Oh, no. No, I'm sorry, dear Count. I won't wait another week. I got married for love, and love is calling me. Be patient. Remember the saying: "Love is more intriguing if there are lovers' quarrels." -Good morning. -Oh. -My wife. -Our wife. -Sit down. -We don't know yet who she belongs to. -My dear. -Our dear. My dearest. Linguine pasta. Your favorite dish. You're always such a dear. Love, you are such a darling. Dressed like that at the table? "Every count explorer wears khaki at all hours." "It's not strange to be at the table in a Saharan jacket". We have a poet here. I'll throw a glass at him. Eat! No. Oh, no. This is too much. Not the butler, too! -I can't stand him. -Sit down, Antonio. I won't sit down. Absolutely not. Sorry, but I'm already supporting your son. -My son? It's his son. -Whatever. I'm the one supporting him! I don't want to support your husband too. No, my dear. You must make up your mind. It's either me or him. Your heart must speak. Donna Rosa. Count. Forget it. The other husband has been nervous all morning. As Vallabrega says, "Who gives a darn." -Enjoy, love. -Enjoy. What a nice room. While we were away, Dad set up the house. I literally owe everything to your dad. The house, the shop. Let's call him. I want to thank him. Hello? Yes. I'll put him on immediately. -Sir, you're wanted on the phone. -I'm not here for anyone. As you wish. It's the princess, your daughter. Why didn't you say so, you Mamluk? Out of the way. Hello? Daddy's joy! When did you come back? Oh. And how are you? -How's Andrea doing? -Fine, and you? I'm… so and so. No. It's nothing. I'm perfectly fine with being so and so. No, don't come here. I'll come to see you. -When? Tonight? -Tomorrow. But I wanted to hug you immediately. I'll put Andrea on the phone. Dad, I must thank you. Andrea, don't mention it. What are you saying? Rosetta wanted a house all to herself, and I gave it to her. Don't worry. Just enjoy the house. Make Rosetta happy. I'll make her happy, Dad. Don't worry. -Rather, are you happy? -So and so. No. I'm happy. Andrea, I'm happy so and so. Do me a favor. Are those two jerks there with you? -Yes. They're at the shop. -Listen to me. I can't shout. Yes. Have them come here. -Got it? -Don't worry. Thanks. You're just standing there? Don't you have anything to do? Go away! Go away! There's plenty to do! Go. What, are you spying on me? Spy! What are you saying? Yes. He's the son of the consul of Naples. -Why? -I know why. I'll tell you later. -How old is this boy? -Wait a minute. I'll ask him. -Robert, how old are you? -Seven. -Seven. -I heard him. His name sounds like a talcum powder. Rosy, you're cheating on me. I know what it means! Send Robert down. I'll beat him up! Robert, go down to Pietro. He wants to beat you. I'm eating cake. He doesn't want to come down, Pietro, because he's eating cake. Ah, you treat him well. You never gave me any cake! You know what? We're not engaged anymore! Goodbye! To hell with women. They act like little girls. I want to drink to forget. Give me a coke. -A coke to forget? -Yes, hurry up! Ouch! Guess what I found in your desk drawer. -What? -Guess. Is it something bad or good? It's the starfish I gave you when I first met you. Remember? At the feet of the sailors' Holy Mary statue, you said to me, "It's an old tradition. Here in Capri, if you want to tell a girl you love her, you give her a starfish. When she falls in love too, she puts it at Holy Mary's feet and he understands." But you didn't believe in this legend, and you said, "The prince and Cinderella only fall in love in fairy tales." The princess, instead… fell in love with you. Forever. There we are. All done. -Give me the ox. -Here it is. A masterpiece. Where is it? I told you, give me the ox. This is the donkey. -Isn't it the same? -No, it's the ox and the donkey. Come on. It's a masterpiece. A miniature. -Here you are. -The ba… The ba… The baby? You place him at midnight. Not yet. Got that? -Do you like the Nativity scene? -Yes! -I made it. -Bravo. -We finished, too. -Come. There are gifts for everyone. Let's go. There's a gift for us too. I want a bicycle. -I want the soccer ball. -How lovely. -Come on. Each take one. -This is mine. -Mom, this is for you. -Thank you, my son. Now, let's get ours. -They are so beautiful, aren't they? -Mine walks. Look. Mine talks when you press a button. -Do you like it? Does it look good on me? -Yes. I'm so happy, Andrea, but I'm sad when I think you must leave after the holidays. It saddens me too, Rosetta, but it's just for a few days. Actually, why don't you come along? Tuscany is a place to discover. -No, you're going for work. -So what? While I look for antiques, we'll continue our honeymoon. -Don't tempt me. -I will. I'll be the devil. No. Some other time, Andrea. I'll stay in the shop and learn the trade. Right. Don Andrea, excuse us. -Isn't there… -Anything for us? -Why don't you look behind the tree? -Maybe Santa Claus thought of you too. -Open it. -You open it first. Me? Gaetano! It's full of 1,000 lira bills! -Thanks, Don Andrea! -You're welcome. What a great Christmas! -Gaetano, are you happy? -Yes, we'll count the money later. Thanks, Rosetta, my child. I've always dreamed of having such a beautiful shawl. I'm happy I guessed what you wanted. -I love you so much, Mom. -Thank you. Andrea, thank you, too. Thanks for what you do for me. May Holy Mary bless you always, my handsome son. You too, Mom. Andrea. You've always sang, at Christmas. Sing for Rosetta, and for all of us. With Your pure shade of white Snow You give joy To every heart It's Christmas The great Holiday That knows how To win over everyone's heart A song Comes from the sky So slowly And with the snow It gives us A Christmas Full of love A Christmas Of happiness Come, children. I still dream of a white Christmas. Just like the ones I used to know. Where the tree tops glistened… and children played with Santa Claus. Next to the lit fireplace, Grandma told fairy tales, while outside it snowed. Everything was white, and silent. A song Comes from the sky So slowly And with the snow it gives us A Christmas Full of love A Christmas Of happiness Everybody to the table! Merry Christmas! -Merry Christmas, Mrs. Maria! -Let's eat! Merry Christmas! -Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas. Cheers. Cheers. Yes. Good night. Good night. Yeah. What a lovely Christmas. You come down from the stars King of the heavens And come in a cave That is cold and icy You can't even sing. Honorable Count. -Good evening. -Don Ferdinando, what a pleasure. Frankly, the pleasure is mine. Mr. Alfonsino sent me here to freshen up your memory. On Christmas Eve? No need. I remember my commitments. I'll return the two millions to Mr. Alfonsino very soon. And when would that be? Let's say, in one… two weeks. Let's say, tomorrow is Christmas. -Let's make it on Boxing Day. -But it's too soon, Ferdinando. It's too late, Count. Then, let's say on Boxing Day. Good for you, Your Excellency the Count. I fully agree on the date. Merry Christmas and happy evening. Yes, happy, Ferdinando. Damn you. Hey, Mom. I must talk to you. Mom. -Mom is sleeping. -It's urgent. Wake her up. I can't. If I wake her up, she gets nervous. -No worries, I'll wake her up. -No, you won't. -Let me in! -I'm her husband! -I'm her son and I come from Capri. -Don't go in! -I want to talk with Mom! -Let her sleep! Mom. -Who is it? -Dad, why are you alive? -Death plays funny games, my son. -What about India, then? The snake? Mom will explain. Come to my arms. My son. The son I lost and found again. He was lost and he's still lost. -Why did you hide? -Why? Because we can't trust you. -We must avoid a scandal. Do you get it? -Oh, I see. True. A scandal. If people found out that two husbands live in the same house, -in the same bedroom… -My son, you know your father. And all of Naples knows me, Count. We sleep together to check on each other, -because I'm jealous and in love. -With Dad? -With Mom! -Anyway, the scandal is recent. -See? -Dad, can you lend me two millions? -I don't have a penny. -I meant the other dad. -I knew you'd blackmail me! I knew it! -Dad, what are you saying? Ask him for 100,000 for me too. I'm broke! Tomorrow I must pay a debt, and I need two million and 100,000. -Is it increased? -With time, interest rises. Okay. I'll put up with the blackmail, but only half! I'll give you one million and 50,000 lire. Here. -Take it or leave it. -I'll take it. -We'll take it. -I knew you'd take it. Thanks, Dad! Good night. Bye, Dad. Please, don't die again! Bye, Dads! -Good night, Mr. Count. -Sweet dreams, Prince. I can't believe I must sleep with this Indian. Take off your hand or I'll break it! -I tried. I'm a veteran. -Don't try again, Mr. Veteran! All right. -Do you snore? -I'm an Indian. -Good night again. -Sweet dreams again, Prince. Again. That's it. Come on. -Come here. -Don Antonio. Here. -Let's hide. -Why? That butler spies on me. I must tell you a secret. I chose you because I consider you faithful friends. Thanks. I'm beginning to suspect the countess isn't honest with me. So, for my own peace of mind, I need to find out if Donna Rosa loves me or her husband. -Aren't you her husband? -Yes, but there's that Indian. Didn't I tell you? The Indian who got poisoned by the snake, but he really wasn't, so it didn't bite him. -Oh, the Indian! -Yes. The one with a feather on his head. -I know! -Got it? -I know what you should do. -What? Bet on those numbers. Thirty-one, the landlord, meaning you. -What? -Forty-seven, dead man talking, meaning the Indian who is alive. -Two numbers in a row. -Then you can add Donna Rosa -and the butler spy. -That makes four in a row. -How is that a solution? -If the numbers come out, it means Donna Rosa doesn't love you. If they don't, it means Donna Rosa loves you. -It's true. -Yes, you're right. Wonderful! You had a wonderful idea. Unlucky at gambling, lucky in love, or vice versa. Very well. I'll bet on them. Now, without wasting time. I hope they don't come out. They must not come out. I'll do the test, again and again. I'll bet on Totip, Totocalcio, Enalotto, poker… horses! That's it. Horses. I'll tell you what. Go to Agnano and bet 100,000 lire on a horse who can't possibly win. Wait, let me think. Bet on a horse that never wins. Which one? What's the name? Bombolino. That's it. Bet on number eight in the third race. -Number? -Eight. -Horse? -Bo… Bo… Bombolino. Great. Hurry up. I'll go upstairs. I don't want the butler to see me. -Go. -Let's go to the races. -Good morning, Rosetta. -Hi, Giorgio. -How are you? Are you okay? -Yes, all good. Thanks. You look like a queen in a palace among antiquities. -You must be happy. -Of course. -And Andrea? -He's happy too. No, I mean, where is he? Is he upstairs? No. He left for work. He'll be back in a couple of days. Oh, in a couple of days. So much the better. Why? His presence would've embarrassed me. -And I couldn't have spoken. -What do you need to tell me? I need a big favor. I need to return some money by today. I have half, but it's Saturday and banks are closed. I'm short of… one million. -One million? -Yes. I don't know if I have it. You have it. I'm sure you have a million. -I think Andrea should know about it. -Why should he? I'll give it back to you on Monday, before Andrea comes back. Please, Rosetta. It's a matter of life or death. Believe me. It's the truth. Thanks, Rosetta. I'll never forget this noble act. Yes, make sure you don't forget. Don't worry. I'm a gentleman. I'd never get you in trouble. I'll be here on Monday. Bye. Bye. Hello? Andrea! Where are you? You're already here? I don't want you to go fast. If you're in Florence, you must have speeded. It took you less than five hours. If I'd been there, I'd have traveled at 50 km/h. With you, even 20 km/h, but time never goes by when I'm alone. No, I'll get right down to work. I fill up the tank and my stomach, and then off to the Tuscan countryside. Of course. If I find something good, we'll keep it for ourselves. Okay, okay. But you must call me back. Yes, love. Talk to you later tonight. -Bye. -Bye, love. Bye. Look, it's him. There he is. Quiet, quiet. -Quiet! -What do you want? What is it? No charity. -We are the vassals… -Of the prince of Roccafestina. -May I? -The vassals, huh? No! He must be the waiter. -Prince. -Tell me, Mr. President. Your vassals are here. -Who? -Your vassals are here. They're handsome. -Thanks. -You're welcome. The vassals of the prince of Roccafestina! Scoundrels. Why did you come in? I told you to wait for me outside! Don Antonio. It's cold outside. -There's the nor… -North wind. You're so ugly. You look like a witch. Ugly! You embarrassed me! -The prince's vassals. Look at you. -How did it go? -Badly. -So, you won? I won again. -Look. -They are soap bars. No, they are chips. It's not money, but it is money. -How many are there? -Over eight million. -It's serious, then. -Very serious. -Why? -Because you even won at the horse races. -I'll be damned! -What? I bet on a useless horse that never wins. -Bo… Bo… -Bombolino. -He won. -But he shouldn't have won! -I had told you. Why did he win? -The favored ones were injured. Jesus. How much did he pay? -One thousand lire. -One thousand lire. I bet 100,000 lire. I won another ten million. So it's all over. The end of a great love. Hello? Hello? It's the fourth time someone calls and no one speaks. -I'd like to know who's pranking me. -I know who it is. -Give me the phone. -Here. Hello, Pietro? Hello, Pietro? Don't be stupid. Answer! I know it's you. Hello, Pietro? Pietro. Pietro. Pietro. -A coke to forget? -What do you care? A Sambuca. Hurry! Here it is. Darn it! When are they coming? -May we come in? -Come. It took you long enough. You had me worried. -The numbers just came out. -Which numbers? Three… three… three… You shut up! Let him say it, or it'll take us a year. -So, which is the first number? -Here it is. Thirty-one. Thirty-one, the landlord. You made me bet on it. -The second? -Forty-seven. Dead man talking. I have that too. The third? Eighty-eight. The snoopy annoying butler. You made me bet on that too. I already got three in a row. -Go on. What is the fourth? -Fifty-nine. I don't have it. Tell me the fifth number slowly. -Sixty. -I have it. I've got four in a row. You made me get four in a row. You see? I have evidence, now. Gaetano. Gennarino. Donna Rosa doesn't love me. Donna Rosa doesn't love me. She doesn't love me. I don't understand. What is there to understand? He was born unlucky. With 200 lire, he won 16 million. -I don't understand you either. -What's there to understand? This tragedy could've happened to me, but it happened to him. Andrea! My dear. Why didn't you call me last night? You made me worry. -I didn't sleep all night. -I'm sorry, but I came earlier. Okay. Then I forgive you. I'm happy. You know, I managed to buy everything. My car is full. But the most important thing… is that I saved money. -Did I do a good job? -Sure. Where is the million that was here? You know, Andrea, I took it. I put it upstairs with the rest of the takings. I was just checking yesterday's takings. You got really good at this. Where are Gaetano and Gennarino? I need them to unload the car. They went out for an errand. They'll be back soon. Never mind. I'll freshen up a bit, then I'll take care of it. All right. Hello? Can you call Giorgio De Barberis for me? It's not important. Tell him it's a friend. Yes, Giorgio, it's me, Rosetta. Andrea came back unexpectedly. Okay. I'll try my best to come now. Okay. I'll see you in half an hour at the rowing club. Yes, I know where it is. Okay, bye. I forgot the electric razor in my bag. -Who was on the phone? -It was… Dad. He wants to talk to me urgently. He's waiting for me at the club in half an hour. Does it bother you I'm leaving now that you just came back? No. If your father needs to see you, go. -Will you put things in order? -Of course. -Thanks. I'll come back soon. Bye. -Bye. -Hi, Giorgio. -Hey, Rosetta. You want a drink? -No, thanks. -Let's sit down. Excuse me. Let's sit here. -Did you bring the money? -No, unfortunately… Now what? You had promised me. Why didn't you want me to tell Andrea? He would have been okay with it. -Tell him now, then. -It's too late now. You want me to tell him? No. It would be worse. He'd lose his respect and trust in me. Rosetta, you're making a big drama out of this. The money is yours, after all. No, it belongs to both, now. Come on, Rosetta, don't make that face. Try to understand. You have a husband, a father. I've always been alone, without anyone. Living in a golden cage, deprived of love. Who else could I have asked? Only you. Condemn me, if you must. Despise me, if you want. Don't say that, Giorgio. I don't regret helping you. On the contrary. I'm just sorry I lied to Andrea. You see, in a few days I'll close a deal and I'll honor my debt. Yes, Giorgio. Don't worry. It's not about the money. I made a mistake with Andrea. Actually, I think I will tell him everything. You've touched me, Rosetta. Thank you. Andrea! What're you doing here? That's what I should be asking you, but fortunately I saw you. You followed me. You spied on me! Yes, and I don't regret it. I opened my eyes! I'm not a husband you can buy with a nice house and a shop! -Andrea, I… -Stop! Were you kissing your dad? -Are you thinking… -I don't need to think. I saw it! Here. I don't need these keys. I don't have a home anymore. Gentlemen, we are here gathered for… -Francesco, you can go. -No, Francesco Giuseppe stays here. -Why? -I need him as a witness. I keep on betting and winning. At the lottery, at cards, Totip, Totocalcio, roulette! What does this mean? It's clear. It's evident. -You are lucky at gambling. -Therefore I'm not lucky in love. -Who says that? -The proverb! Dad two, you still believe in proverbs? Dad one knows what he's saying. He's Indian. Listen. Dad one, wife two and son zero. Let's not change the subject. We gathered around this table to solve a family problem. -Francesco. -Francesco! -I say Francesco! -Me too. -The phone. -Phone. Damn. Hello? Good evening, madam. Yes, I'll put him on. -Who is it? -The princess, your daughter. -Excuse me. -Please, Your Highness. Hello? Darling, what's wrong? Do I really have to come now? No, it's not late, but I'm sitting at a table. I mean, it's a board meeting. What is it about? If it's something urgent, I'll come immediately to see you. No, there's no need. No need to hurry anymore. Good night, Dad. Solitude You descended on me like a fog Solitude You descended on me unexpectedly And now I'm here With emptiness inside of me Hope for tomorrow Who knows Solitude A desire to pray deep in my soul And I think about you again Among people who smile but I wonder why And now I'm here And everything around me Every moment talks to me about you I'd like to have you here My face is sad I still love you and maybe you Think about me a bit Love, being next to you Is like being in a fairy tale I love you, you know? Solitude In my silence I think about the past And I realize that I should have never left you And now I'm here With emptiness inside of me Hoping to see you Come back I'd like to have you here My face is sad, you know? I still love you and maybe you Think about me a bit Love, being next to you Is like being in a fairy tale It's like being in a fairy tale I love you, you know? Pietro, hurry. It's late. You have school tomorrow. Who can it be? -Who is it? -Mom, open. It's me. Andrea. Andrea. Why are you here at this hour? What about Rosetta? Where is she? Andrea, did something happen? Mom, Rosetta doesn't love me. She never loved me. -What are you saying? -You were right. A fisherman shouldn't have courted the daughter of a prince. My son, I know what happened. You argued and now you're making a fuss, right? It happens to everyone, Andrea. In the beginning, your dad and I argued every other week. But we were young and we loved each other. Mom, I caught Rosetta kissing Giorgio. -Who? -Giorgio. -Donna Rosa's stepson. -No. I can't believe it. I wouldn't either, if I hadn't seen her with my own eyes. You're making me sad, my son. I thought you were happy, settled down. -But instead… -Instead, that's the reality. No, Andrea. Reality, in matters of love, always has four eyes. Two eyes that don't see at all, and two eyes that don't see well. -Now rest, try to get some sleep. -No, Mom. Later. I couldn't sleep now. Actually, I'll go out. Where are you going? I'll say hello to the sea, and apologize for abandoning it. As of tomorrow, the sea and I will be together again. When you come to see me You look at the sea You look at the leaves If I talk to you, you don't answer You're distracted, I wonder why I keep you in my heart I'm still in love But you think about someone else And you're forgetting me When you say "yes" Remember that You must not let die A heart that loves You said "yes" to me On an evening in May And now you have the courage To leave me Your eyes are not sincere As when you told me As when you swore to me "I only care for you" And trembling you promised With a hand on your heart "You don't forget your first love" Now you're forgetting me When you say "yes" Remember that You must not make suffer A heart that loves You said "yes" to me On an evening in May And now you have the courage To leave me "Clothes and supplies, trip to India…" Given the situation, there's only one solution left. And then, please, let's hurry up, because none of us wants to stay here until midnight. Father one is leaving for India and needs a small capital to start a new life. Father two, Prince Antonio, puts the small capital at disposal. I knew it. Anyway, I agree. But on condition that the count will take Giorgio with him. -I agree. -Mom, how could you live -without your beloved son? -Better. I'd live much better. -The counts are leaving. -Yes, we'll leave. How much do the counts need in order to leave? -Thirty. -No, 50. -Fifty thousand? -Fifty millions. -The counts won't leave, then. -Why? -Because the accounting isn't right. -Antonio, what is 50 million for you? It's 25 million per count. It's a deal. Fifty millions, and the two counts leave immediately for India. I get it. You want to take all my winnings, right? Without crying. No. I won't cry. I'll give you 50 million, as long as you leave. Yes, I made up my mind! I'll give you 50 million. As long as you get lost. I'll make out a check. Start getting the winning tickets. The Lottery one, the SISAL one, the Totip and the horse races! There. I'll give you 10,000 lire extra for the taxi. Straighten your turban. And get going. And don't show up again. I don't want to see you again, or I'll go crazy! -You'll drive me crazy! -Antonio, are you crazy? Yes! That's what I'm saying. Crazy! Hey, that's Pietro! He was hiding on the boat. -Pietro! -Come here! No. My husband is out on business. Good day. -Pietro! -Rosetta! -Why are you here? How did you get here? -I hid inside a fishing boat. -Are you alone, then? -Yes. -Didn't Andrea send you? -No. I came by my own will. You have a clean face. It can't be what I heard. -What did you hear? -Everything. I know everything. But you must tell me what really happened. If I tell you the truth, will you believe me? Sure. I always believed you. Listen, then. Andrea, you made a mistake. When Rosetta spoke, I looked into her eyes and she told the truth. Giorgio kissed her like a brother to thank her for the million she lent him. It didn't seem like a brotherly kiss to me. From far away, the eye deceives. -Why didn't she tell me, then? -She says you didn't let her speak. You were the only one who spoke, just as you did with me. Pietro, are you sure? I'd put my hand on fire, like that Roman warrior. Damn, what was his name? Mucius Scivola! No… Scaevola. -What can I do? -I don't know. Rosetta says she's done with you. You know what? Women are better than men. Andrea, you made a mistake, and maybe I did too. Goodbye. I'll go patch things up before it's too late. I must change my clothes, too. -Whose coffin is this? -Mine. It's an Egyptian sarcophagus. Don't you see how I'm dressed? -All in khaki. -Excuse me? As an African explorer. Excuse me, if you're going to India, why an Egyptian sarcophagus? On my way to India, I'll stop in Egypt to leave the sarcophagus and the mummy. -Why, is there a mummy in here? -Yes. Exactly. Let's see the mummy. -It could scare you, I warn you. -Only the living scare us. This mummy is so ugly. You're not any better. -What did he say? -I didn't speak. Did the mummy talk? No. I mean, it's Pharaoh Paolete III. -Fifteen thousand years ago… -Less. -What did he say? -I was saying, 1,500 years ago… -They put him inside a pyramid. -I think I've heard about that. -I thought… -You can go. Thank you, Customs Officer. -The mummy spoke. -You should drink less. Trust me. Francesco, they left. They finally left! Love and happiness are waiting for me. Love with Donna Rosa is a wonderful thing. -A bit dangerous, too. -Nonsense. Captain, let's go right back to Naples. -Let's go to Naples! -Yes, Prince. You want a beautiful letter Because you want to show Your girlfriends that I care about you But these sweet words full of passion I am not capable of writing As you would like And I waste time and I lose whole hours With the desire to see you happy But if I write to you, love Until tomorrow I could tell you the same words Rosy, Rosy, I love you I keep you in my heart I desire you with all my heart Rosy, you are my love Rosy, Rosy, I love you I keep you in my heart I desire you with all my heart Rosy, you are love Rosy, you are love -Pietro. -Rosy. Rosy. Rosa. Rosa. Rosa, my love. My love. Darling. My happiness. Soul of my soul. -Finally alone. -Antonio, what are you doing? It's too early. They just took him away. He's still warm. -Who is warm? -Poor Paolo. -No. -I saw him in that coffin. It wasn't a coffin. No, it was a sarcophagus. It was well padded. He was totally fine. You should've seen how handsome he was with his beard. Will he breathe well? The coffin had holes in it. Don't worry. Let's not bother with the count. Let's think about us and our future. Our future… is still yet to come. -What are you saying? -Yes, Antonio. The hour of truth has come. What truth? Antonio, I care for you. You put all your assets at my disposal. You are the crown on my head. You solved all your issues, but… now you can't solve mine. The prince of Roccafestina knows no problems. He knows no obstacles. What worries you? What can I do for you? You can't do anything about my conscience that keeps repeating, "Donna Rosa! Donna Rosa!" "You are bigamous!" Bigamous. It's true. You are bigamous. Until when? Until God wills. Oh, Jesus. I didn't think of that. Antonio, don't be discouraged. We have time. We have lots of time before us. Time, Rosa? What time? We are… so young. Yes. Of course. It'll be forever. -Good night. -Good night. Silence She's sleeping in her room Her window remains closed To my love Go I want to be left alone Tonight's cold wind Will help me And while everything is silent A clock strikes midnight It is a long night I don't know what to do Without love And if love is like the wind Sooner or later it will go away If love is like the wind Sooner or later it will return Oh night Put a star on the window Oh wind, play a guitar She will wake up For me Oh night Tell her I'm waiting outside the door That the moon is out and it's not cold She'll understand you It's midnight It is a long night, we have a lot of time For forgiving And if love is like the wind Sooner or later it will go away If love is like the wind Sooner or later it will come back If love is like the wind Sooner or later it will go away If love is like the wind Sooner or later it will come back If love is like the wind Sooner or later it will go away If love is like the wind Sooner or later It will come back Andrea! -Look. There's a starfish. -It won't be there tonight. A boy in love will take it home, and it will be as happy as we are now. When we grow up and get married, remember that you must never lend money to anyone. I promise. THE END
