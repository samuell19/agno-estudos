Oh, crap. Where did you get that? The junk room. Did you ask if you could go in there? Oh, I thought I-- It's a simple enough question, Carla. Did you ask if you could go in there? No. Sorry, Dad. What's happened to your top? I, um, I ripped it. Where did you rip it? Right. So now, do you understand why I want you to ask before you go in there? Yes, Dad. Good. - But Dad. - What? What is this for? -You see that red light there? -Mm-hmm. Right? Well, that's-- When that's on, it's recording. All right. Heya. I'm gonna show you around today. This is my room. My bed, for sleeping. Toys, for playing with, though I don't really play with them much anymore. Look, my curtains have roses on them. They're my favorite flower. This is Sam. Come on. Say hi, Sam. Carla. Ready! I hope you like it, Dad. When was slavery abolished here in the UK? Um, 1815. During the Battle of Waterloo? No, just before. Oh. Oh, I thought it was later. Like 1830 something. And do you still believe that? Or are you happy to accept that I'm telling the truth? No, I-- Yeah. Hello? My son kicked his ball over our fence and it's in your garden. Shh. Go. It's okay. I live around the corner. I can't open the door right now 'cause there's lots of furniture in the way. Sorry. Could you just help me to get my ball back? I'm afraid this is me mother's house. I'm just helping her move out, so I'm no good to you. I can get it myself if you could just-- Just go away. Get out of here. - Hi. - Hey. It's okay. - He's gone. Did you hear him? - Yeah. You hear the tricks he tried to pull? Yeah. People are getting really sneaky and we gotta do something. Give me that and I'll record you. Okay. So you can watch it back later to remind you. -Okay. Ready? -Mm-hmm. Go! Try again. - You ready? - Mm-hmm. Go! Faster. Faster. All right. One more. Ready? Go. Come on. Come on. Go. Five, four, three, two. The door. You forgot the door. - Okay? - Mm-hmm. Go! Five, four, three, two, one. Yes. That's it. Yes. Perfect. That's the test then? Your mother would be very, very proud. Dad, I was wondering if-- Okay. If you want to. Can I really? Well, because you did so well tonight. - Thank you. - All right. Thank you. Hey, it's all right. Hey. Oh. I wanna show you something else. Come. This is one of my favorite books. It's about a girl who drinks a potion and shrinks. And, um, this one is about a princess. And this one is about a girl called Nancy Drew, who solves mysteries, just like me. - Carla? - Dad? You know what you gotta do when I'm gone? Yeah. I've got to hang up the washing, uh, clean the oven and, um... And? And change light bulb here in the living room. I'll be gone three or four hours. You remember the knock? - Yep. - Okay. Hi, Sam. Do you want to come out and play? Here Hello? Hello? Is anyone there? Hello? Is someone there? I know someone's there. I saw you. Hello? I have something you might want. I can help you. Hello? Just come and have a look. Just answer the door. I know you're there. I've got something for you. Sorry, I-- I can't get to the door. There's a lot of-- of furniture in the way. All right. Um... I can't see any. You sure? This will get rid of you. Oh, Go-- Go on, then! Go away. My suit! Sorry. Look, I'm not mad. I-- I'm-- I'm not angry. Um, I'm doing the houses. House to house. I'm doing the whole street, trying to sell this stuff. Uh, I've-- I've got tea towels, dusters, washing up liquid. Uh, no thanks. Oh, hang about. What about my best seller? No. Okay. Look, microfiber cloths. No, I don't need any. Come on. You gotta buy something. Okay, um, listen, what's your name? Is it Carla? - What? - Yeah? But is that your real name? What do you mean? Is your dad in? What? No. Have you ever looked yourself up on the Internet? Not there, are you? And your dad? What's the Internet? What's the Internet? Serious? Okay, well, I was gonna give this to my 100th customer as a bonus, right? You can have it. I'll put it through the letter box. Uh, but don't tell anyone. Have a try, play with it, and try searching for yourself. I don't want you getting in trouble. How does it work? You'll figure it out. The password to get in is 1717. All right. I'll go now, but I'll be back very soon. -Good? -Good. Dad, what's the Internet? Internet? Where did you hear about that? I read about it in the book. Oh, did ya? Well, you tell me then. What do you think it is? Um, it's a place where you can search for things. Yeah. Well, that's one thing it does. What else happened this afternoon? Dad, do I have any other names? What? Did I ever have, like, a different name before Carla? What do you mean? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? What kind of bloody question is that? I dunno. I was-- I was just wondering. -Sorry. -No, come on. Why did you ask? -Well, uh, there was, um-- -What? -There was a-- a man who-- -What man? A man came around. -When? -When you were out. -Who was he? -I-- I-- I don't know. Don't tell me you don't know. Who was he? Uh, a-- a new one. What did he want? He wanted to talk. And did you talk to him? No. No. I threw a bucket of water on him. Okay. And what did he want to talk about? I couldn't understand him, but I didn't tell him anything. After dinner, you go straight to your room, right? And turn that bloody thing off. Go on, turn it off. Time for bed. Carla. There's a man trying to get in the house. We need to move. Come on. Dad, what's happening? Dad! What's, going on, Dad? Dad? What's happening? No, no, no. Right there, not safe. Great. Come on. Who is it? Dad, who is it? - I have to do something. - No, Dad. Stay. It's all right. It's all right. I'll be back, okay? - No, Dad. Please. - I promise you. I promise you. I promise you. I'll be back. All right? - All right. - All right. All right. Okay. Dad, dad, dad. Dad. Dad. Dad. Dad. Dad. Dad, did he hurt you? No. No. I'm okay. Okay. Okay. It's all over. Ah. Oh, Dad. You all right? Yeah. I'm all right. Ah, I shot him off. Oh, God. Oh, gosh. Who was that, Dad? I've been meaning to tell you this when-- when you were older, but I suppose now is the time. Dad, what are you talking about? Now, listen. I never wanted to scare you, Carla. I never wanted that. What I wanted was for you to feel... you know, safe. - Do you understand? - Yeah. And-- But-- I mean, that doesn't mean that there's nothing to be afraid of. So, when you were very, I mean, barely three. Yeah. I was working in London and one night I was walking to the underground to go home to you and I see this man in a suit, uh, no one else around. And then I see there were these other two men got out of the car, they go up to the guy and they-- they, you know, they hold him and he just stood there and he didn't-- he didn't know what to do. I suppose he was shocked. Then another man gets out of the car, he walks up, and right there in the street, he stabbed him over and over and over. I mean, it was obviously a planned attack. So, I start shouting, you know, "Stop!" But by the time I... Oh, Dad. Well, those men are criminals, you know. Gangsters, if that don't sound too-- Well, I-- I called the police, obviously. Told them what I'd seen and that man that did the stabbing, he-- he was arrested and charged with murder. And then the police told me that if I testified to that man's associates, you know, the criminals, they might come after me. But I mean, I knew I had to testify. I had to. So, the police said that they could, um, they could move us anywhere we wanted, you know, and-- and make a-- a fresh start for us. So, I chose here because it was far away and safe. And, well, it's worked so far. No one's found us. But that's why we do the things we do. We've gotta be so careful with-- with strangers, Carla. Did you think it was that man I spoke to? I think so. Did you see his face? No, not-- not clearly. No. I'm so sorry, Dad. I'm so sorry. Hey. I'm so proud of you. Oh, Carla. Good job. Mm, yeah. Mm-mm-mm-mm. Oh, sorry. I. It's for his own protection. I know. Okay, go ahead. - Love you. - Love you too. Bye. I'll be back just in time for dinner. - Okay. - Okay. I'm sorry, Sammy. It's all my fault. Dad? You again. Hello. How are you? If you don't leave right now, I'm gonna call the police. What? Come on. There-- There's no need for that. I'll report an attack. - By who? - You, last night. Not me. I'm being harassed by a threatening man. I don't know what he wants, but I want him to go away. Will you go away? Come on. Look, I never attacked anyone. What about that phone I gave you? Did you find out anything? I am warning you. Did you try and find your mother? Why would you say that? Do you know what happened to her? Or do you just know about what he told you? You can't play these games with my head. All right, look. I'm not a tea towel salesman. I'm here because I'm a private investigator, like a detective. You know what a detective is? Prove it. Okay. Here. Hand it over so I can see it. Sure. Frank Unsworth, that you? Yeah, that's me. All right then, Frank Unsworth, How did she die? Oh, um, wasn't expecting that. Are you sure she did? Look, I don't want you to risk anything, but ask him about it. Just see what he says. Look, I better go, but I'll be back again as soon as I can. No, you've lost it, mate. Go on. Get lost. I can't find you on the Internet either. Now, we'll see if you cheat, huh? All right. Okay. Okay. Mm-hm. -Dad? -Mm-hmm? You know Mum? Yeah. What-- what happened to her? You know what happened to her. But what did she-- what did she die of? Oh, I don't really want to talk about this just now, Carla. I'm sorry. But she-- she did die though, didn't she? When she was giving birth to me? -Carla. -And where is she buried? -And why is it that we never-- -Carla! Sorry. Do you think I'd lie to you? No. No, Dad. Why would I lie to you about something like that? -Do you think I don't love you? -No. Well, maybe you don't love me then. Is that why you're asking these questions? No! No. Please, just forget I even said anything. Dad, I know you know what's best for me. Go, your room. There's someone in the garden. I need to get a closer look. I know. I know. Might be time to leave. Go somewhere where-- where no one knows us. Oh, shit! Carla? I'm in the toilet. I'm leaving. I'll be back in two hours. Okay. Don't forget to lock the door. I won't. Let's see if we can find them. They should be here somewhere. Ugh. Huh. Oh crap! Oh, God. Oh no. Oh, God. This hair. Who is that? My second birthday. I don't understand. Look, that arm. That's not my dad. Someone else. I think... it looks like a woman's foot, doesn't it? This gotta be my mum. That's gotta be my mum. Let's see out here. Mis... sing. You forgot to lock the door. What happened to Mum? What did you do to her? What happened to Mum? You forgot to lock the door! Yeah, see? It's working, isn't it? Yeah. You do realize just how dangerous it is to leave the door unlocked, don't you? Well, you probably, probably got distracted, I suppose. Hey, focused on some nonsense over there. And you just let your guard down. Dad, I'm sorry. No, you don't-- you don't need to say sorry. You don't need to be sorry to me, okay? But you gotta look after yourself, Carla. - All right? - Okay. Good. Huh. Hug? Come on. Hopefully, I won't be too long. All right. Save your battery. Here. Oh, wow. Always filming, eh? Is that a problem? No. It-- it-- it's-- it's good. Why? So, did you do what I said? Did you ask him about what happened to your mum? Can't you just tell me? Look, I-- I would love to, but here's the thing... How do I know I can trust you? What? Well, how do I know you won't take everything I tell you and repeat it to your dad? If he finds out I'm here, it could get difficult. I-- How-- how'd you do that? Oh, I got it from an accident. Really? Sorry if it was me. I was just trying to get you to understand for yourself. Your dad is not being honest with you. What do you get out of this? So look, I-- I want you to do me and yourself a favor. Like what? Will you record him for me? Uh, with the phone I gave you. I mean, film him. How do you expect me to record him on a phone? I'll, um, I'll show you. Look, come around here. You see the tiny black circle on the top of the screen? Mm-hmm. Yeah. That's a camera. And if you turn it over, you see the other tiny black circles? - Yeah. - That's another camera. We're gonna use 'em both to get some video. Now-- now turn it back to the front. Okay. You see the orange and blue icon? Right. Wait a sec. Uh, yeah. Push it. But-- but-- but not too hard. Oh, I can see me. I can see me and I can see you. Yep. Both front and back cameras record at the same time. Uh, use the front one to record your dad, but keep it secret. He mustn't find out, for your sake. Try and get his face. Film him talking. But if you are up for it, I need you to ask him about what he did. Did? Yeah. Has he talked about much why you two are in hiding? Oh, he said we're hiding from criminals. That after he testified... Well, what is it? Yeah. Well, I think there's more to it. What? Ideally, I need you to film a confession for me. A confession? Well, of what? For evidence. Then I can take it to the police. The police? Why? What's he done? You're gonna have to ask him that. This is rubbish. You don't know him. - Carla. - No! Stop! He never testified, Carla. Ugh! Just tell me about my mum. Not yet. Get me that confession first. Help... you? "It's the truth. And I think you're starting to--" And my mum? "Do this for me, I'll tell you what happened to her. I promise I have info--" You still want me to get a confession? Hiya. Have you eaten? What's up with you? Nothing. Just feeling good. Is that allowed? Where were you last night? None of your business. Do you want some breakfast? Carla? I'll have a banana. Banana. - You okay? - Yeah. You've seemed off for a while. Well, I suppose I've not been sleeping well. - No? - No. Do you want some pills? No. Why not? You said pills were for the weak. Good. That's right. They are for the weak. Did he make it to hospital? - Did who? - The man. Which man? The man you saw get stabbed. Oh, what do you think? Well, I know he died, but you never said. Would you... would you mind telling me the story again? Oh, Carla, it's not an easy story to tell, that. Sorry. I shouldn't have asked. Why did you? Well, I like to think of you in that situation. You know, trying to save someone. Makes me feel safe. Okay. Come and sit down. Right. So... I was working in London on a job. What sort of job? Construction. I was a site manager. Did you have much experience as a site manager? - Carla. - Sorry. So, uh, on a job and then one night, quite late, I was walking out of Bethnal Green tube station and up ahead of-- No, that's not what you said. That's not right. You said last time that you were going into the tube station, not coming out of it. What? You said last time that you were-- I heard what you said. I'm just asking why you've said it. Well, I mean-- I was going out of the tube station. Okay, but last time you said you-- I know what I said. I'm not in the habit of saying the wrong thing, Carla. - Sorry. - We lived near Bethnal Green. So why would I be going into the tube station at night? - I know. It's just... - Just what? - Last time you said-- - For God's sake! Why do you insist on fighting with me? Making me out to be some kind of idiot? I'm sorry. Do you understand that I would die for you? - I don't know-- - Do you understand that I would do anything to protect you? Yes. So, why do you have such little faith in me? Making out I'm trying to trick you, lying to you. Is that what you think of me? A liar? No, I never-- - So I'm not a liar then? - No. So you must be the liar, then, saying that I was going into the tube station. You were lying. Yes. Why? I don't know. I'm sorry. Right, Frank or whatever your name is. That is not what he said. He said he was going into the tube station. I can prove it to you. I've got it here. - Right. - Barely three. Yeah. I was working in London. Oh, no, that's not it. That's, uh, that's too late. Here. One night I was walking to the underground to go home to you. See that? See that? I was right. I'm in here. What you doing? I'm washing my face. I thought I heard you talking to someone. Uh, no. It was just the pipes whistling. Oh, okay. -Frank? -Hey. I'm sorry to have called. I-- I-- I just wanted to check and see how you're doing. You've seen the videos? Well, that's the thing. I-- I haven't. What? For whatever reasons, they ain't uploading. Well, why not? Um... I'm not quite sure. This is... I haven't done this very much. Very much. I-- I'll fix it. It-- it's just a hitch. Are you sure you're a private investigator? Well, what did you film? Not much. But I know he's lying to me. Okay, that's good. Keep digging. And when you have more footage, I-- I-- I'll come by and I'll collect the phone from you. Why did you attack my dad? I didn't. Then who did? Sorry, I have no idea. Did you see who did it? No. Then your guess is as good as mine. All right then. Good luck. Oh, wait, what if I don't wanna know if he did something bad? What if he finds out about all this? Okay. Look-- He's already-- I can show you this. See that? Yeah. That's you when you were a kid. Someone in your family gave me that picture to help me find you. That's... where was that? I've seen that house before. You used to live there before you disappeared. -When? -Sorry, Carla. Um, get that footage, please. I need proof. Otherwise, all this will be for nothing. What will be for nothing? It will all become clearer. I promise. Hey! Hey! What do you think you're doing? Hey! Come here! Hey! Hey! Hey! What do you think you're doing? Dad? Oh, my God. This is very, good Carla. Really excellent. And he who waters will be watered himself. What's that? Oh, it's just from some book I read once. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I never see you using your camcorder anymore. Is it still working? Yeah, I, um-- I thought it was annoying you. Does it make you happy? - Yeah. - Right. Well, nothing that makes you happy could ever annoy me. "A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me and I saw, felt, heard, and smelt at the same time. And it was indeed a long time before I learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses." Hey, looks like you're struggling with the operations of your senses. I'm fine. Hey, go to bed. I can read more from it tomorrow. Okay. You know I love you, don't you? I love you, too. Dad? What happened to you? It's nothing. It's just... I just... it's barely a scratch. What happened? Nothing. I just... Dad, I need to know. If it's a wood wound, I need to pick out the wood with the tweezers. If it's a nail, I might have to use a disinfectant. It was a piece of metal. - Piece of metal? - Yeah. Right. Okay. Ooh. Okay, okay. Right. Okay. Ooh, sorry. Okay. There you go. This bit... Thank you. He's in the bathroom. So I think I've got a few minutes. Shh... Hey, what were you doing? What were you doing in here? Okay... Nothing. Sarah. Oh, God. What were you doing in here? What's this? "Justice..." "Michael Carolan." The water. Carla? Yeah. Nice shower? Yeah, fine. Have you been poking around in that junk room again? - No. - Hmm. You should be careful, Carla. Hi. I can't take your call at the moment. - Uh, please leave me a message. - Not now. Hi. I can't take your call at the moment. Uh, please leave me a message. Look, this is really important. I think he knows what we're doing. And I'm really scared. I found something and I filmed it. Look, can you just call me back? Yeah? Just saying good night. Goodnight. - Hiya, Carla. - Dad. I've had to boost security all around. Ah, that's better. Been watching you, you see. I got cameras indoors now, too. One up there. See? One there, covering the exits. And they record audio, too, these. So, I can hear you, you ungrateful brat. Dad, please. What?! What, Dad?! Dad! Fucking... Fuck you! Hiya. Drink? -What is it? -Water. You tried to run away last night. Where were you going? Who were you gonna meet? Carla... You need me. Do you know that? There's people out there would hurt you to get back at me. Is that what you want? Yeah. It's me own fault, really. I've given you protection and love for so long that you've started to take it for granted. And now look what you've made me do, Carla. I didn't want to do this. Well, enjoy that water. I can wait. Are you ready to tell me yet? No. Why are you doing this? You're breaking my heart. Maybe tomorrow, then. Water... Water. Water. There we are. Bet that's good. Yeah? Yeah? There we are. All right. Now, I will give you more, but I got some questions for you first. So... listen. And I need you to be honest with me. Do you understand? Because we can do this again and again. Where did you get that phone? A man. A man. A man? What man? Frank. Frank. Who is Frank? Private investigator. -He's a what? -Private... -private-- -A private investigator, is that what you're saying? Now, why did you try to leave? Moth-- -What? -Mo-- My mother. Your mother? You lie. All this is because of her? Yeah? Is that what this is all about? Your mother? locks clinking] Come on. Someone here to see you. Put that on. Quick. Quick. Come on. Up. It's all right. In you go. Carla, this is Sarah, your mother. Oh. Oh. Say hello, love. Hello. Aw, look at you there. With your stripy baby clothes. Show me. Aw. Aw! Oh, look. I think it was your birthday, you got your little crown on. Can you show me one of us together? Yeah. Yes, sure. Oh, wow. Look at my hair back then. Oh, I think you look great, my love. And what a sweet baby you were, Carla. Eh? I'm sorry I wasn't there for you, Carla. And I'm sorry I never told you the truth, love. I, um... I wasn't well for a long time. I had-- have problems and I-- I-- didn't want it to affect you. Even in those first few years, I-- I wasn't a very good mother. So when your father said he needed to go away, I-- I thought that was a good opportunity, you know, for you-- for you to get a fresh start and-- Do-- do you understand me? But she never stopped loving, you know. No. No, I didn't. Never. And when your dad talked about me, it was just my... my heart just tripled in size, I'm sure. You-- you talk to each other? Yeah. Yeah, all the time. You know, he-- he tells me how well you're doing in all your subjects. When? When do you talk to each other? Don't interrupt your mother. No. No. No, it's fine. Yeah, well, we talk. Sometimes your father comes to visit me at home. There are-- there are things we need to figure out, Carla. Things that we-- we need to learn. But I'm here now, and I'm willing to give it a try. So's your dad. I always wanted a daughter, but I just wasn't ready for you then. But now I am. Now we can be together. Oh... It's all right. It's all right. - That's enough. - Yeah? -Okay. -Thank you. Absolutely. I like quite a strong cup. - That's fine. - Yeah. You're a good tea maker. Thank you. I've got lots of practice. Okay. This is nice. -Pretty sure that's poisonous. -Whoa! - Yeah. Give it a spray. - Mm. That's it. Let's put it in the light. Give it a bit more sunlight. All right. Look at this. Ah, it's beautiful. Thanks, Mum. Just put those... in the saucepan. Well, I can cook for you now I'm here. Well, can you teach me more? I like this. It's nice. And though everywhere, beloved, for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper, his talents could not have recommended him at any time. Mum. - Yes? - Are you... are you sure about Dad? What-- what do you mean? I-- I don't know. Um... What is it? Do you really believe there are criminals still trying to get revenge on him? If he says so, then yes. What is it? I wanna tell you something, but... I'm scared of what you'll see. Oh, baby, don't be scared. Come on. You can tell me anything. Please. I'll help you. What is it? Um, oh, I-- I was in the basement. Tell me what happened. Come on. Give me a hug. Come on. Just tell me. I wanna help you. I was in there for-- for days. And he kept me there. He handcuffed me to the radiator. He didn't let me eat. I was so thirsty. Oh, my God. I know what he can be like. - But this-- this is-- - I was so scared. I thought I was gonna die down there. I'm so sorry. I'll speak to him. No, he can't know that I told you. - He could-- - It's okay, my baby. You're my daughter and he won't ever hurt you again. You're mine now. And I'll protect you. We're gonna get out of here, you and me tonight. - Okay. - I love you and I'll never let you go again. Hello? Oh, hello. - Is everyone okay? - Yeah. Good. - Is there any dinner? - Yeah. Just coming. Oh, lovely dinner, my darling. - Thank you. - Look at that. Look at that. Wow. Okay. Now, you two grab a glass each, all right? Because, uh, I've got something to say. Oh. Um... I am thrilled... to be entering this new chapter of all our lives. And I know I've not been the perfect father or husband or anything... but... the love that I hold in my heart for the both of you is untouchable and unchangeable. Aww! And, uh, I've, uh-- I've got something else to say, actually. Um... Carla, me and your mum... have been talking and, um, well, I've decided that we could all do with a fresh start somewhere new. Um, so... pretty soon we'll be looking for a new place, all right? But anyway, that's all for tomorrow, isn't it? Let's, um-- let's eat. Ooh! Thanks. Ta. Yeah, go on. Lovely. Loads of it. -I love it. You want sprouts? -Yeah, thanks. Lovely dinner-- Oh, yeah, you haven't put any gravy. It's not the same without gravy, is it? -Here you are, love. -Oh, no. Um, Carla just told me she didn't like gravy. - No. - You don't like gravy now? It's a job to keep up with her, innit? Right. So where do you wanna live? Oh, um, I don't know. I think I liked our old house best. I miss it. Well, what did you like about that place so much? Oh, it was-- it just looked like... it was like a picture book house, wasn't it? All made up? Lovely garden. Sorry. Not the food. The food's lovely. Oh. Sorry. Um, so sorry. What-- what else? Um, oh, the-- the front was painted, um... a lovely... pinkish color? My favorite color, actually. Seashell pink. It was nice and quiet. Pink? Did you not mean white? Mom, I said, did you not mean-- D-dad? Carla, come on. We need to go. What have you done to him? It-- it's killed him. It's fine. It's only a small dose. What? Plant fertilizer He'll be fine in a minute. Now, just go and get your things. I won't let anything happen to you. Just go! Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. God! That woman is not my mum. And now she's taking me somewhere. We need to go now! Come on. We got to go. Come on. Come on, quick. I've got to take you away from here. Come on. Come on, quick. We need to get out. - You're hurting me. - No! You're coming with me now. He's had his chance to play happy families. Come on. - Carla, are you okay? - Who are you? - Who are you? - Excuse me. - Out of my way! - Wait a minute. No one's going anywhere. Carla, are you okay? I-- I was worried. This woman is trying to kidnap me. She pretended to be my mother. Don't listen to that pedophile. Pedophile? Carla, I don't know why he's saying that. I can say whatever I want. She's my flesh and blood. Now, come on, Carla. We're walking out of here now. Tell them. - Dad! Dad! - Get behind me. Dad! Carla, that man is a criminal. What? That's the main reason why he's been hiding. He's been on the run for 15 years, hiding from the truth and from justice. No. No-- Carla, you know he made up that story about witnessing a murder. That was just the beginning. It's all a fake. - No. - What? All the bars on the windows? The intruders, they don't exist. There was no court case. There was no criminals out for revenge. It was all just a con to make you believe that he was a hero, to keep you here. So you wouldn't go outside and so no one would see you. Did he tell you what he did? Ten men died on his site. - No. - While he was drunk and high. - Crushed... - That's not true. Deep underground. Did he tell you about that? About his job as a site manager, the tunnels? He would've got 20 years. - But he ran. - That's a lie. Like a coward. And the worst thing is he took you with him. Frank, isn't it? Private investigator? No, you're not. He's no more been telling you the truth than I have. He's an estate agent, Carla. An estate agent who likes chatting up young girls. Carla, that's not right. Well, look, I am an estate-- That's enough! Stop it! Stop it, you're hurting me. Open up! Police! Put that camera down. We're going out the back. Come on. Drop your gun! ...we've got runners coming towards you. We need to get out of here quick. Hold it right there. We've got two detained at the rear, boss. Let me go! No! Carla, Carla. I'm Nat, a family liaison officer. Are you okay? Did he hurt you? No, uh, I'm fine, thanks. Um, what is all this? We responded to a call from a member of the public that said you might be in danger. Yeah. That's, uh, me. You know, cut a long story short. Basically, your dad spent a lot of time on the website I made. A website for justice for the victims. - Oh. - And that's how we tracked him down. Are you okay? This must be a massive shock. So what now? Did they not tell you? There's someone here that wants to meet you. Carla, this is your mum. She's been looking for you for a long while. My baby. It-- it's you. It's really you. Mum, is it you? Come here. Mum, I made this film for you. I'm ready to talk now. I'm ready to move on.
