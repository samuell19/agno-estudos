Dispatch to 44. 44, go ahead. Respond to the 400 block of early road, report of a crash involving a motorcycle. 44 copy, on my way. When you experience death like I have, you see that God's not there. Tell me, pastor, why does God let bad things happen to good people? Why is God silent? Do you really think that God, the creator of heaven and Earth, and everything in it is silent? You really think he's just ignoring all of us down here? Maybe he's talking, Jonathan, and you're just not listening. I wonder what you'd say if you saw the things I've seen. My dad was my best friend, and my best memories of him were on that lake, doing what we loved. Yeah? You know, I remember one time we went deep sea fishing, and I put a bass line looking for sea bass. All of a sudden, my line just took off. Something big got it. I finally pull him up to the top and it was huge, and the three of us pulled that thing up over the side, and got it on the deck of the boat. It was 105 pounds. It was five foot long. Five foot? So what do you think, for your next birthday, if we take you deep sea fishing? For real? For real. Wow, that's pretty cool. I can't think of a better way to celebrate your next birthday than to take you deep sea fishing. I didn't realize it then, but that was my last good memory of my dad. I can remember the day she told us. As a kid you never fully understand. Daddy's really sick, and Jesus is going to take him to heaven soon. You're going to be okay, I promise. I promise. We are going to be okay. Hi, Jonathan. Come in. Come in. You'll be the man of the house soon. Mom's gonna need you to be strong, okay? Who's going to take me fishing in the ocean? Sorry, Jonathan. I won't be able to take you to the ocean. It's almost my time, I'm sorry. No. I still regret not spending more time with him. I regret not talking to him more. No! Come on. No, no. No, no, no. That was the day I realized God didn't care about me. God didn't care about any of us. Even if he was real, why wouldn't he listen to a child? Sorry, Jonathan. I won't be able to take you to the ocean. You'll be man of the house soon. Mom's going to need you to be strong, okay? Hey! Jonathan? Why did daddy die? We prayed for him. Who's gonna take care of you? Who's going to take care of me? I'm sorry, son. I'm sorry. You're not, you don't understand. Jonathan, wait. Please, Jonathan. Jonathan! Eight years later, I was training to become an officer. Let's go, Jonathan move it. Come on. Come on, get them out of there. Come on, move it. Jonathan, why do you want to be a cop? I want to make a difference, sir. Get back, get back. Get back! Fire. I want to protect and serve, sir. I want to be a better man, sir. We'll see about that. Put your hands on the ground. Welcome to the force. Congratulations, Hickory. You made it. - Thank you, sir. - Proud of you. - Hey! - Hey. How did it go? I don't think I did that great. I'm sure you did better than what you think, right? Yeah. Well, listen. You're smart. You know what you're doing. I'm sure you're going to figure out a way to get in there, right? Yeah. I guess that's why you're looking at the new Officer Hickory. No? - Oh yeah. - Yeah? Oh yeah! I'm so happy for you! Put this on, strap up. Ready? Stacy, did I ever tell you the story of the most beautiful girl in the world? No. Once upon a time, there was a girl so beautiful she lit up every room she walked into. She was confident, with piercing bluish, greenish eyes that always changed colors, and radiant blonde hair that shined like the morning sun. Now you might be wondering whatever happened to the most beautiful girl in the world? Well, she met some lucky chump, gave him her number on a napkin with a note that said don't lose this. I didn't. Stacy Evangeline. They say in life we only fall in love three times, but I've been falling in love with you 365 days a year for the last three years of my life. And if you promise not to lose this, I plan on falling in love with you over, and over, and over again, for the rest of my life. So will the most beautiful girl in the world marry me? I wish your father were here. Yeah, me too. He's be so proud of you. Oh, I love you my son. I love you, mom. - Oh, I know that! - I know you do. I'm so happy for you. Oh, mom. Bye mom. Stacy was the best thing that ever happened to me. She's the reason I'm here today. She's the love of my life. I really don't deserve her. She sounds like an amazing woman. She is. What happened to that happy couple? When did things go wrong? On my honor, I will never betray my badge, my integrity, my character, or the public trust. I will always have the courage to hold myself and others accountable for our actions. I will also hold the constitution, the community, and the agency I serve, So help me, God. Officer Hickory? Yes, sir. Steve Watson, field training officer. Nice to meet you. - You ready? - Yeah. Let's go. So I read your file. Looks like you were top of your class, but trust me, there is no training that could prepare you for the streets. Look, I know you just got married and you're all excited. I get it. But you got to get your head out of the clouds, son. These streets are tough. If you aren't sharp and focused, these streets will eat you alive, and it will get you killed, do you understand? Yes, sir. Look, I'm here to learn. You won't have to worry about me. Let's get this straight. I run a tight ship. We do it by the book. If you want to get trained by me, you do what I say, when I say it. If you hesitate, it could cost you your life. Now fix your collar. You're a professional and you need to look like one. Bet you're fun at parties. No, I am not fun. Now get in the car. So are we getting some donuts or what? New rule. You have something stupid to say, don't. Yes sir. Dispatch to Unit 71. This us? 71, go ahead. Respond to the area of ridge salvage yard in the 900 block of Thurman Road for the reports of shots fired. A caller stated at least two males armed with assault rifles, multiple shots heard, no further description. In the 71, on location. This is it, huh? So what's the plan. Keep your head on a swivel. We don't know what we're walking into. Here's your pack and tourniquet. What? Base, shots fired. Hope they showed you how to use that thing. Right, we got to go. I'm gonna check this corner. Hear that? Mhm. That's them. Yep. All right, I'm gonna move on. I got you. Police, put your gun down now! Put your gun down! I will shoot, put your gun down now. Put your gun down now. Now! I almost shot him. I know. - I almost shot him. - I know, but you didn't. You know why? You used your brain. Good instincts, son. Good instincts, come on. Police, freeze. Get on the ground now! What's going on? All of you on the ground now, hands where I can see them. Officer, I got a couple cold ones if you just let me go. I don't drink on the job, man. Come on, watch your head. Hey, hey, hey. You did a good job today, all right? Thanks. Hi! Hey baby, how are you? I'm good, I'm just grading papers. Yeah? Is everything okay? Yeah, everything's going fine. It's a slow night, pretty boring actually. Well, I miss you. I miss you too. I just wanted to call and hear your voice, and tell you I love you. I love you too. Yeah. Well look, I got to go, so don't wait up for me, okay? Good night, I love you. Sorry about that. Hey man, it's all right. Listen, you did the right thing over there. We don't need to bring this world into our homes. Our families don't need to know what's going on out here. Any available unit respond to code three, the Shinston Road on the interstate... Let's go. With the report of a motor vehicle crash, with entrapment and injury. Report of a vehicle down on embankment on it's side. Witnesses reporting vehicles appeared to be racing before the crash. Unknown if any other vehicles were involved at this time. Check that vehicle, I'll check this one. Dispatch, this looks serious. 11 80, put a rush on that body. Hey, Police, stay right there. 10 for Unit 44. Sydney. She was 16. Sydney would never get to fall in love. She would never get married, never experience motherhood. All her hopes, dreams, gone. Her entire life flashed before my eyes. You doing all right? I've never seen someone dead like that before. Look, police work isn't easy. You see a lot of crazy things out there. Let me tell you something, off the record. I found one thing that helps me get through all of this. What's that? Couldn't do this job without Jesus. - Really? - Yeah. Here, take this. That's our church. You should stop by some time. Come on, let's go. Death notifications. This is the hardest part of my job. They have no idea, huh? No idea whatsoever. What are you doing? Reading the Bible. Why? Because it helps me. How do you tell a mother her child just died? No, no, no. Hey rook, here's a drink for you. Who are you? I'm Thomas. Jonathan, nice to meet you. - Good to meet you. - Thank you. I heard you ran into some West Virginia's finest today? Yeah, that's one way to put it. I don't know how you guys do this, man. Hey, look kid. After a while you get used to it. Yeah, some days you're out there doing paperwork for eight hours, and the next day you're getting shot at. Where's Watson. Oh, guys a square. Doesn't drink at all. He'll never step foot in here. We heard about the girl. How are you handling that? I mean, I've never experienced something like that before in my life. It is what it is. Hey guys, to the rookie. To the rookie. Get that glass up to here. To the rookie. Thank you. It'll get easier. Sooner or later, you won't feel a thing. You have a good night. You be safe, thanks for riding. Hi. Hey. Oh, you stink. Mm, where have you been? Few of the guys, they wanted to celebrate the rookies first day. Couldn't say no. So how was the rookie's first day? It was different. My FTI was a nice guy, I met him for the first time today. We got donuts and joked around. Good. Now go get some rest, I'll catch up with you, okay? I love you. I love you too. No, no, no. Thank you. Can y'all help me pray for my husband? The Lord, Jonathan is a good man, but I think this job is more than he expected. I think that he sees things that he can't talk to anybody about. I sense that it's hurting him. It's changing him. I feel like he's feeling hopeless, and he needs you, God. I know that God can help him, and that through the power of Jesus, that I can get my husband back. Amen. Hey Jonathan, come on in. Lieutenant. It's good to see you. It's great to see you. Please have a seat. So I've been talking to your FTO, and he tells me you have some talent. Just doing my job, sir. Well, that's certainly good to hear. Apparently you're doing it really well. We're thinking about moving you up. How you feel about the traffic safety end? You pulling my leg? No, I am not. As part of that, you get a motorcycle and an unmarked car. Congratulations, son. Wow, this, it's an honor, sir. Thank you so much. Well, you know what? You've earned it. Just don't make me regret it. I'll do my best... All right. Look at that, nice. Yeah, and we can afford that, but they can't upgrade my crappy cruiser. I know, kills me. Wow, who's the lucky chump? No idea. Certainly isn't you, Hickory. Oh, no way. There's no way on God's green earth they're entrusting that to you. Hey, were you able to find a big enough helmet to go over that head of yours? Don't be mad they don't make these for senior citizens, Rodriguez. Oh, that's cold dude. What was that? That is cold, bro. That's cold. One more time, I can't hear you? That's cold, bro. Man, I can't believe he's got that ride. I know. Dispatch to Unit 44. 44, go ahead. 44 respond code three to the intersection of Second Street and Maple Avenue. We have report of a single vehicle overturned, multiple occupants, possibly children in the vehicle, unknown injury. Fire and rescue are responding. 44, 10 four. That bad, huh? Whole family. It was horrible. What can I say, kid? It's part of the job. Someone's got to do it. Johnathan, you not hungry? Jonathan? Hey, kid. Mrs Hickory, where is she? Excuse me, is everything okay? Yeah, I'm just looking for my wife. Oh, third door on the left. Hey, walking feet! Are you okay, sweetie? So, can anybody tell me what this is? Good job. And how about this? Funnel. Funnel, good job. And what about this? We're having a baby? We're having a baby? I'm gonna be a dad! Look what we made, she's perfect. Let her sleep. Okay, all right. You got her? And you know her sleep schedule, and you know she gets fed in 20 minutes, right? Mhm. Are you sure you need me? No, we're fine. You sure? Okay. And you're going to call me, right? Yeah. Okay. Shh. Shh. Drunk driving is still the number one cause of death on our roadways. Two out of three people will be impacted by a drunk driving crash in their lifetime, which is why we take this award very seriously. It is reserved for an officer, an exceptional officer who has gone above and beyond to keep our streets safe. He is a shining example of someone who is making our community a better place. It is my honor to present this award to Officer Jonathan Hickory. Hey. Johnathan, you reek of alcohol. Thank you for your service. Wow. Thank you everyone. It is an honor and a pleasure to stand here before you all. Family comes first in our lives. With another baby on the way, we know just how important it is to keep our streets safe. I unfortunately know better than most the horrific, tragic effects of drunk driving. It's heartbreaking to say the least. The effects of drunk driving aren't just limited to those in the impact, to our family members, our friends, our kids. Thank you. Dispatch to 44. 44, go ahead. Respond to the 400 block of Early Road, report of a crash involving a motorcycle. 44, copy. I'm on my way. Hey, what have you got for me? Hey man, took you long enough. I actually do have something for you. Here, it's his wallet. Whose wallet? The guy on the motorcycle, he's over there. Oh, man. What? I know this guy, I went to high school with him. Uh, where did you say? Right over there, under that white sheet. - Thanks. - Sorry, bud. Get out. Get out now. Get out. Look at what you did, look at what you did. He had a family, and a wife, and you killed him. You killed him! You killed him. Look at this, look at this. You killed him, you killed him. I couldn't understand why they weren't angry. I looked into the eyes of that family and all I saw was sadness. Pure sadness. No anger, no resentment. They just missed their kid. They should be angry at the drunk who killed him. They should hate him. But they couldn't. They were calm, and peaceful, and that infuriated me. He was this drunk who just took the life of their loved one over some stupid bottle of liqueur, and they just forgave him. Just like that. If there's one thing I know, its that we're all gonna end up dead with no hope anyway. What's the point in this life? What difference does it make, and who cares? I don't understand. Where was Jesus when that guy swerved through three lanes and killed Daniel? Jonathan, Jesus didn't kill Daniel. Why don't you blame Satan? Oh God, come on Satan. Oh, so it's okay to blame Jesus for everything, but not Satan? Not the one that the Bible tells us comes to steal, kill, and destroy? He gets no credit? That family had peace because they know Jesus. Because they know there's more to this life. Because this life is not perfect. It's broken. We broke it, sin broke it. I'm having a really hard time buying that. If you got it all figured out, then what are we doing here? I don't know. Why did you want to talk? Do you want help? I'm trying to help you. You wouldn't understand. Then make me understand. It was Sunday, October 20th. My wife was in her 20th week. Stacy? Make it stop, it hurts. Stacy, are you okay? Stacy, open up. Stacy passed the baby, call 911. What do you mean she passed the baby? Stacy passed the baby. Go Jonathan, call 911. My wife is 20 weeks pregnant, and she just, she just passed the baby. I can't do this. I can't do this. At 14 weeks, the brain impulses in an unborn baby begin to fire. At 15 weeks, the unborn baby can sense light. At 19 weeks, the babies senses are all developing. Touch, taste, vision, smell, and hearing. Christian was 20 weeks old. Dear God, hear us as we pray for. We pray for their comfort in a time of sadness. Hear , in this trying time. We pray that you lift their child into a kingdom of light. In your name we pray, amen. I'll clean up, okay? Look. You are not alone, all right? You should come to church with us. God, I pray for my husband. He is a good man. I know deep down he's a good man. But he needs you. He needs your help. He's still the man that I love. He's my Jonah, and he's lost at sea. He needs you. This is my last prayer, God, and I don't know how, but he needs your help. We need your help for our family. For me. For Ana. For Jonathan. I need you to bring him back to me. Please help him, God. Bring him back. Okay, yep. Officer Hickory, report to Lieutenant Campbell's office. Let me call you back. Johnathan, come in. These detectives are from internal affairs. Have a seat. Can I ask what this is all about? I think you know why they're here. You're under investigation for violating our code of conduct. You'd better hope we don't find out you were involved in immoral conduct. You are to hand over your departmental laptop and cell phones, along with all the lock codes and passwords. And you will not discuss this investigation with anyone, is that clear? You're dismissed. This is the story of Jonah. Jonah was a good man, but he was scared. What did he do, mommy? Jonah didn't know that God had a purpose for him, that God had a special mission for him, and God found a way to get his attention. God sent a storm, and he sent a big fish to go and get Jonah, and bring him back. And in the end Jonah did the right thing. He did God's final wish, and he came back. He did the right thing. What's the point of this life? What difference does it make? You've seen so much death. Your whole profession revolves around the evil in this world. You see Satan's handiwork everyday. It must be tough. The thief comes to steal, to kill, and to destroy. You've let him rob you of your peace, of your family, of your life. It's time you fought back. You need the only one who's ever overcome this evil. You need Jesus. You've been doing things your way your whole life. How's that working out for you? It's time you did things God's way. I don't know. I do. You need to be honest about your affair, about your drinking, about the way you've been treating your family. There are consequences to your actions and Jesus is not going to change that. But Jesus will change you. You want to be a man about this? You want to make things right? You want to fix it? First you have to surrender yourself to Jesus. That's the first step. Honey, I realized I made a lot of mistakes. I know I haven't been good to you. I know I've been a disaster. But that's all going to change, because last night I made a promise to God. I spoke to him for the first time, and I promised Him that I'm going to be a better man, better father, better husband. I'm going to make it up to you and Ana. Stacy, what I'm asking is forgive me. Please. Okay. I'm working on it. I'm going to be better. Okay, this one's for you, and this one's for me. Careful, you got it? Wow, say thank you. Thank you. Jonathan, you do you know that this is strange, right? You sitting here with us getting ice cream, spending time with us. It's gonna get better. Exactly what she said. Jonathan, our family needs this. I know, I promise things are going to change. Next time we're getting pizza, right? No, ice cream. Ice cream again. Ice cream, uh-huh. Is it good? Yeah. Yeah, all right. I'm gonna take this, okay? Be right back. Okay. Lieutenant? Jonathan, I need to see you in my office. I have to result of your investigation. What flavor are you going to get next time? Vanilla. You didn't like this one? No. All right, I guess I'll see you then. Oh my goodness gracious. Who was it? Oh, it was Lieutenant. They need you? No, just saying hi. Okay. You again? Well, at least this time you don't have your gun drawn. I need your help. Sure. What's going on? I'm an idiot. I take it you haven't told her. No, I haven't. You need to tell her, Jonathan. I can't tell her. She's going to leave and take Ana. I don't know what I would do if I lost them both. Well, if you don't tell her, you're going to lose them both anyway. I sense there's something else going on. The force, they found out about the affair, did an entire investigation. I'm about to find out if I lost my job. I screwed up. Really, really screwed up. I could really use a prayer right now. I told you before, there are consequences to your actions, and praying won't make them go away. But God promises to be there to help you through those consequences. I'm not asking for a miracle. I know there are consequences, but I also believe that God does answer prayers. Please could you just say a prayer with me? Of course. God, please help me keep my job. You know what, being an officer in this county is a privilege? Well do you? We demand all of our officers be beyond reproach. All of them. And you? You don't. Yes sir, I understand... I'm sorry, I believe I was still speaking. As for the charge. Officer behaving in a scandalous, infamous manner, in violation of West Virginia code. For that, you're guilty. Dismissal without pension, without severance. Nothing. That's the verdict. This job is all I know, sir. It's my passion. It's what I'm good at. It's the only thing I'm good at. I didn't come here to make excuses, but we both know that this line of work gets inside your head, and between things I've seen on the job and losing my son, I've been a wreck. I've been avoiding my problems, and this job is, being here, it's the only thing that makes me feel like I'm making a difference. I know I need to be held accountable for my actions, and I don't deserve this job. I don't deserve my family. But I want you to know that I'm working on it. I'm going to be a better man. Look, Jonathan, I know you, okay? I know this isn't like you. Look at me? You know I'm actually willing to bet my badge on you. You know why? Because at the end of the day I think you're a good cop, and I truly believe everyone deserves a second chance. That's why I fought for you. And guess what? That's why I got them to keep you on the force. Thank you. Oh no, no, no, no, no, don't thank me yet. Oh no, you will be disciplined. You will no longer be a motorcycle or traffic officer, and that take home vehicle? Yeah, that's going. You will immediately be sent to uniform patrol division, on a midnight shift, pushing a cruiser. Now give me the keys to the motorcycle and the unmarked. Look, Jonathan? I am taking a huge risk on you, you understand that? Huge. Tell me I'm not making a mistake. I won't let you down, sir. These are the keys to your new ride. Car 305. You prove to me that you can change, and in a year, maybe we can reevaluate your performance. Don't make me regret this. You're dismissed. So what's with the squad car out there? I got put back on nights. Start tomorrow night. What? Yeah, I got some trouble at work. They swapped me over to midnight shift. Jonathan, how? I mean, you've been working so hard. What happened? It was a vehicle pursuit a few months ago, remember the one I was telling you about? Yes. And? And I gave the suspect a break. Didn't write them up, turns out they had warrants. Look, I think I'll like this better anyways. I wont to have to deal with seeing the wrecks and, who knows, maybe this is a good thing. A good thing? Jonathan, how is this going to be a good thing? You're never going to see us. Look, it's only for a while. Okay? We'll make it work. Yeah, I guess. I love you, don't worry. We'll figure it out, okay? Okay. 44 respond code three to Rocco's liquor store, 1260 East Main Street with a possible carjacking. Caller stated they say a large male with a beard forcing his way into a black van in the parking lot. Hey, freeze! Stop right there! Unit 44, I need back up. Copy, Unit 44. We have back up on the way. Any available unit respond to code three. Don't move! Hi Megan, hi Ana, what's going on? I'm taking Ana to get some ice cream. We'll be right back. Oh, okay. Hey, what are you doing here? Get in the car Jonathan. What's going on? Just get in the car now. Jonathan, what happened? You were my best friend. You were the one that I wanted to spend forever with, that I loved unconditionally, that I went there and I took these vows with you. Does it not mean anything to you? What happened to my husband when I lost my baby? Where were you? You were getting drunk, you were disappearing, you were working night shifts and everything else. This is what you were doing? When I laid there every night aching in pain, needing you here, needing my husband to come home to me, to tell me that he loves me, and you're out sleeping with some other woman? Do you even know what you've done? Do you know what you're doing to me? You are not the man that I married and I want him back. You broke us. You broke me. What happened? No, because you're not sorry. No, don't touch me. Stacy, you should know that the day that Jonathan came to see me, he told me all about the demons he was fighting. He told me about the infidelity. He also told me that you are the love of his life, and he didn't feel like he deserved you. This is one of the most difficult things that could ever happen in a marriage. Jonathan, it took you years to break this marriage. It's gonna take you a long time to repair it. But you're going to have to ask yourself the hardest questions. Do you want to fix this? Do you want to move forward to forgiving? You're gonna have to look deep within your heart, and you're gonna have to decide is this family worth fighting for? It's gonna be a long journey, but if you turn toward God, I think you have a chance. There are consequences to your actions, and Jesus will not change that. But Jesus will change you. You want to be a man about this? You want to make things right? You want to fix it? First you have to surrender yourself to Jesus. That's the first step. I've been a slave to you for way too long. I am sick and tired of you controlling me. God, God please. Give me the strength to break free from these chains. I don't know where to begin. I hate myself, I hate what I've done to Stacy, to my family, to Ana. And the weight of all this is overwhelming, and I'm having a lot of trouble dealing with it. Jonathan, that burden is not for you to carry. That weight on your shoulders is for Jesus to carry. You have to give it to him, or it'll crush you. I just want my wife to love me again. It's gonna take time. Hey, I can do that for you... Don't touch me, stay away from me. It's not gonna be easy. You have to push through. You have to believe there's hope. She believed for years that you would turn around. Now it's your turn to believe in her. Jesus, help me become the man my family needs me to be. Forgive me for what I've done. Help heal our wounds. Help me fix this mess I've made, please. Hi, Ana. Could I talk to you for a second, sweetheart? Come here. You know your daddy loves you very much, right? Very, very, very much. Look, I know daddy's been mean a lot lately, and that's not your fault, okay? I want you to know that daddy promises to never be mean to you ever again. Okay? I love you, sweetheart. I'm sorry. Could you forgive me? Okay. Well, before we can make any changes together as a couple, Jonathan, you're gonna have to face some things. Now I know you have a lot of hurt from the loss of your father, so I want you to try something. We are going to try an exercise. I want you to pretend your father is sitting in this chair. You want me to play pretend with that chair? Jonathan, we're going to have to work on you before we can work on restoring your marriage. Now I want you to speak to this chair as if your father is sitting in it, right here in front of you. I want you to say all the things you wanted to say to him. Dad? Dad? Dad, you were my best friend. You were my hero. I miss you. I wish you were here. I wish you were here to see me graduate the Academy to become a police officer. I wish you were here to see me marry Stacy, and meet your granddaughter, Ana. She's just like you, smart, funny. I want to tell you that I love you, because I feel like I didn't have enough time to tell you. It's not fair. I never heard the words, good job, son. I miss you, son. You're a good son. I couldn't say the word dad. I just want to tell you I love you because I feel like I didn't get to tell you enough. I feel like God took you away from me. I feel like a piece of my heart is missing and I'm never going to get it back. All right, well, get home safe, okay? Yeah, this one's cute. Mhm, I like her shoes. Yeah. Hey, who want's to play a game? Me! You both do? Okay. Ana, you're first. What's it say? I am soft and I help you sleep. That's a tough one. What do you think would help mom and dad sleep? A blanket?
