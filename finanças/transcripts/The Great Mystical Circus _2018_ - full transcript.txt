But, I won't be here for much longer. They want me to be leading man in a play by Franga Junior. I play a Brazilian guy.. Who, to win over his fiance's father, what does he do? He pretends he is a French aristocrat. You've got to be blond, to play AFrench aristocrat, Celavi. Bis... Bis... Bis... Bliss, bliss, bliss. Beatriz. Hmm! The Empress. I know a real empress... My father's her doctor. There are no empresses in Brazil. They're all gone. - Oh, really?! - Really. The Empress Catarina isn't Brazilian. - No? - No, she's in exile here. There was a revolution, back in her country. The Empress had to leave, and she came here. Her people call her the Virgin Empress. - Virgin?! - Virgin.

My mom, Beatriz, the human bullet, was the only one left. Beatriz?! I was baptized Agnes. I changed it in honor of my mother. Agnes is nice too. But it doesn't rhyme with anything. My mother drank too much... she began missing the target... And one day, she left the circus. For good... left me all alone in the world. One day the circus owner tried to rape me, I almost killed the old guy with an ax. And after that... no other circus would hire me for anything. I really miss the circus, Fred. You should have seen me in the circus! What is it? Can't anybody fuck in peace anymore? Come in. ...it's for you, Fred. The Empress is waiting for you in her bedroom. ...it's my heart, Fred.

Your father didn't leave us anything. Practically nothing. Only you can right this wrong. What? L'am all alone in the world now. I'll give you that portrait, when I die, godson... Son. Why didn't you all tell me the truth? My mother... I mean, Mrs. Kieps told me that, when you found out you were pregnant from my father, the three of you went to Paris on vacation. She and my father came back first with me because you couldn't be a mother. State's affairs. The Virgin Empress! ...what my people have always called me, and still do. What do you know about politics, Fred? ...It's better we never see each other again, Fred. But, I don't want you to forget me... ever. And how could I forget Your Majesty? Although we can't see each other any more... I want to give you 2 present. anything you desire. She told me to ask you for money. If that is what you want... Me and your father drank out of these very glasses... and we made a toast to love. To love, Fred. To state's affairs. A circus. What? Didn't you want to give me a present? Anything? Well then... I want a circus. What you want most in the world, Fred... is a circus?! THE GREAT MYSTICAL CIRCUS. The clowns! Look Is she made out of porcelain Is she sad Or the contrary Is she a painting Is she a star If she dances up in seventh heaven Does she believe it's another country Does she merely memorize her role And if she let me into her life Look Is she made out of porcelain or is it ether Is it just folly Is it just the scenery Where does the star live Does she live in a skyscraper And are the walls made out of chalk And if she cries in a hotel room And if only she'd let me into her life Yes, fake me forever, Beatriz Teach me how to walk up in the clouds Forever is always too fast Ahh Tell me all the disasters 1 hold here in my hand Tell me if it is safe For us to be happy Better untie any knots you have at home, Beatriz. Ties, packages, braids, curtains... so the baby boy doesn't choke when he's born. I don't think it's going to be a boy. No baby Freddy? If it's a girl, I'm going to name her Charlotte. Charlotte, very chic. French, right? And is it divine The star's life If she falls from the heavens one day And the audience demands an encore And if the archangel passes round the hat If only she'd let me into her life Happy birthday, Beatriz. How do you know that, Celavi? Asmall bird told me... it also told me you're going to get a big wonderful present! Beatriz! They love me, Celavi. In fact, they come to the circus because the guy may always fall down from the trapeze. Scheherazade. Quiet, quiet! Call a doctor, Celavi. There's no time. She's pregnant. A doctor! You're a doctor.

After what happened in Hawaii, Brazil is going to be forced to join the war... The Americans are going to want to install military bases on the coast up in the Northeast... to get to Europe faster... by way of Africa. Can we go see the camels? - Go on. - Thanks. Bring me a glass of water, please? No ice... The price of land there is going to skyrocket. You can buy now for almost nothing... and then sell it for a lot more to the gringos in no time. You'll make a fortune. His business is the circus, Jean-Paul. So, sell the circus then. He can't take a risk like that. Yes, but unfortunately, you have to take risks if you want to make any money. If you want... I have this friend... areal estate agent, in Rio de Janeiro. I think he could help. What do you think? Merry Christmas, Dr. Fred. Idiot. Where do you think the smell goes to after? I talked to the lawyer again. He's got all the papers we asked him for. Grace... What is Grace doing, Celavi? What? - Good morning! - Good morning! - Good morning! - Good morning! Good morning, grandpa, everything OK? Bless you, grandpa... bless you... Grandpa... Grandpa! Mom! He was crouched over the piano... like he was taking a nap... I held him by the hand, it was cold. Celavi, what'd my grandfather die of? - His heart. - Of love? No, stupid, he had a heart attack. Son of a bitch. Those who don't like me don't know what they're missing. You made the old man change his will. Lotte can only use her inheritance to invest in the circus. Tear it up, go on. There's a copy at the notary public. You're fired, you piece of shit. You can't order me around. You're not my boss. Get out, now. You're fired! The girl would always go to the circus to hear the trumpet player play, just for her. They never talked, but knew of the love each felt for the other. The trumpet player was the best player of all the trumpet players in the world. People would come from all over to hear him play. And he'd play, just for her. One day, nobody knows why, she stopped going to the circus and he couldn't play his trumpet anymore. That's it? You want to leave? Celavi, is this story going to have a sad ending? Since the trumpet player couldn't play, people stopped coming to the circus. The owner begged him to play, but, by then, nobody came to the circus anymore. Well, practically nobody. And then, he raised his trumpet to his lips, and played one note just one note in one long breath... the same note, in one long breath. And people began to fill the bleachers. But then, 2 strange wind blew up and then turned into a hurricane. While he kept blowing on his trumpet, the other instruments blew up into the air all around and all the people were blown about like birds. And the circus tent turned into the large wings of a huge bird of the night that flew up into the sky. Taking clowns, elephants, acrobats, lions, magicians, Chinamen, ballerinas, everything, with it... All swept away by the big bird's wings. The bird known as Albergalia. Ab... what? And there was no more circus? Tell us the one about the elephant that lost its trunk, tell us, tell us, come on. That's no story for girls, Clara. Who's that? Acharacter I made up... for the theater... Hey, Clara! Celavi, when will we see you again? We better not see each other again. Your father wouldn't like it. Celavi... Stay Celavi, don't go. - Bye. - Celavi... C'est la vie! Mom, have you ever seen Celavi in a play? "Captain, who was the crazy guy talking about pirates? I don't know, he left without saying his name." Read that part now with Diana in the Skull Cave. OK, Clara. Jean-Paul... Jean-Paul... I'm working. I hardly ever see you anymore. That's your father's fault, he let the circus go bankrupt. Now I have to fix it. You can't do anything right, Lotte. You can't even take care of your kids. We have something to tell you. Me and Clara, we want to get married. To each other. You shouldn't have done that! He's my son... { can do whatever I damn please with him... And who are you to tell me what I can and can't do? There's a bit of blood on your clothes. No problem, come here... I HAVE NOTHING, I TAKE ITALL Mom... we could call Celavi back.

Margarete, aren't you ready for your act yet? Did you read the letter I gave you, father? From the convent... Why do they always want to leave? Excuse me... Your father wants grandchildren. He wants a heir to take care of the circus when he gets too old. But he promised me, as soon as I was 21 years old, he'd let me enter the convent. Yeah, but he changed his mind. Even God changes his mind. Didn't he regret having created the world, and send the big flood to wipe it all out? Ludwig, for example... The Polack is a great guy, and your father likes him a lot. Get ready, girl. Your act is about to begin. The Great Flying Couple. Three times, Ludwig will somersault through the air. Three times, just like a feather. Like a cloud. Like an angel. Like the moon itself. Yes. The "hechicera" moon. The bewitching moon. Ludwig, do you want to marry me? What?! I asked you if you want to marry me. But, you never wanted... I changed my mind. What's the big deal? Even God changes his mind sometimes. If you promise me one thing, I'll marry you. What is it? Oh, nothing much. The Great Mystical Circus proudly presents... Margarete and Ludwig... The Flying Couple... and their death-defying triple somersault! I'll promise you whatever you want, Margarete. I love you and I always will. There he goes.

No. Margarete, I'm your husband. You gave me your word. Five years, Celavi. Five years, they've been married for nothing. You think we're going to have to teach them how's it done? No, Ludwig, I'll go get it. I'll go. Rodolfo... You're peeing on the circus equipment. What're you doing? Stop it! Get out of here, go on! Let me go... leave me alone! I'm going to tell my father to fire you. You don't have to cry. Rodolfo, no need to cry, OK? Stop it, don't touch me. Don't touch me, let me go. Let me go, Rodolfo... Let me go, don't touch me... No!

The only woman able to hold the weight of 2 man with her hands. But after she became pregnant with the twins... sort of by chance... she never went up on the trapeze again.
