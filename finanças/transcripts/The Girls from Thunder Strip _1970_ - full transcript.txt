(woman whimpering and moaning over twangy bluegrass music) (motorcycle engines rumbling) (engines rumbling to a stop) - Now what the hell's wrong? First, there's Teach back there, and now it's you! Is this haul too much to make in one run? - Hey, the juice is gone, this beast is dead! Hey, how far do you think it is to Hicksville? - Probably just up the road a ways. I've probably got enough here to milk it. - You got a line? - You know I got a line, it's still wet from the last time. - [Animal] Here. - Oh, no, no, I'm so sick. I-I can't, I'm so hungry, I-I'd vomit, I can't. - Do it! (birds chirping) (woman gags) You dumb... That broad's gettin' to be a real drag!

(engines rumbling away) (twangy guitar) - What about me? - Oh, yeah, I forgot. (twangy guitar) Now, you take care of that, honey, that's a 15 cent raise. You look me up when we get to California, and I'll give you your diploma.

They leave you here or what? - Go away and leave me alone! - Come on, sit down, I'll take you with me. - I'd rather walk. - I said sit down not lie down! C'mon, get on! - Joe, you keep your hands to yourself! - Do me a favor, will ya? On the way there, don't get any dumber than ya already are! (motorcycle engine rumbling away) - [Todd] Hey, look, looks like those stragglers have made it. - Huh, yeah, two head are better than one (chuckles). - (claps) Right. (engine sputtering to a stop) - [Animal] Hey, Teach. (Todd chuckles) - [Todd] Where'd you find that mess (chuckles)? - Back in the toolie, somewhere. (birds chirping) - Please can I have some, I'm so hungry! Please, it's been two days! - Huh? - I'm hungry as a dog, please let me have some! - Oh, yeah. (food thwacks to ground) Hey, wait a minute! You said you were hungry as a dog, well get down and eat like one (chuckles)! Hey, yeah, you wanna drink (laughs)? (Todd laughing) Ha-ha, eat that! (men chuckling) C'mon, here, you want a drinK? Heheh, that oughta taste good! - Hello, Harriet, this is Sue Ann down at the store. You better get the sheriff over here right away. Looks like there's gonna be trouble. Yeah, as fast as you can. (phone slamming down) - Hey, do you smell somethin'? - Huh, I think it's an old cow lot or somethin'. - Nah, that ain't no cow lot, that's a hillbilly, a real, live, stinkin' hillbilly! (knife swishes) - Come on! (woman gasps and shrieks) - Oh my God! (body thumps to the ground) (Todd chuckling) (distant engine rumbling) - Todd, let's get outta here, I have a feeling there's gonna be some laws. - Aw, cool it, man, it wasn't your fault. It was an accident, it was old hero boy all the way. (police siren blaring) Oh wait, it's too late, here comes the man now! (car door slamming) - [Sue Ann] The doc's on his way, Sheriff. - I guess it's all my fault. - That ain't so, Sheriff. Those boys over there were hurtin' this girl and he just tried to stop 'em. - All right, son, you go on back over to your gas station now. I'll get your statement a little later. All right, what the hell happened here? - Girl fell down and broke her crown. - I thought maybe somethin' like 'at. (pleasant guitar chord) All right, son, on your feet. ♪ There ought, I guess, to be ♪ (pleasant guitar chord) ♪ A way to end police brutality ♪ (pleasant guitar chords) - I'm talkin' to you, boy!

(wood thwacks to the ground) - [Orville] Get 'em up on the car, huh? - Ow, hurt my finger. (body thuds to the ground) All right, Orville, put 'im in the car. Sue Ann, you stay here with that little girl til the doctor gets here. You call me back at my office, tell me when. (car doors slamming) (engine rumbles to life) (engine rumbling away) (police siren blaring) Luther, I got some customers for ya. - [Luther] What is it? - [Sheriff] Well, that's the singer. - [Luther] What kind of a singer? - Oh, uh, not too good. - [Luther] Aw, poor little fella looks plum tuckered out. - Take 'im on back and lock 'im up. I'll figure out what to charge him with in the morning. - All right. (cabinet rattling) - It's all gone, Sheriff, I drank the last of it just waitin' here for you to show up. (dart thwacking) - Well, here I am gentlemen. Now, what's on your mind? - Oh, well the governor-- - (clears throat) Alex, will you shut up? Sheriff, look, the government sent me down here a long time ago, we were assured by your office that we'd get full cooperation. I just want you to know right now that we have it. - Shoot, what you talkin' 'bout, man? - Moonshine, Sheriff, talkin' 'bout moonshine. Talkin' about illegal whiskey. - Yeah, white lightnin-- - Will you shut up! (Sheriff chuckles) Now, look, Sheriff, the government loses $600 million a year in taxes because of illegal whiskey from stills that are right here in your county. That's where they begin, Sheriff, right here in your county. - (chuckles) That's right, Mr. Conrad. I know that. (dart thwacking) Everybody knows that, Mr. Conrad. Hell, I could go out the front door and take one of these darts, and chuck it out there in any direction and probably hit me about a dozen of 'em. - Ah, exactly, Sheriff, that's what I've been saying. I've been here three weeks and nothing's happened, we haven't made one raid, now I wanna know why! - (chuckles) Well, Mr. Conrad, for two pretty good reasons. Number one, I ain't got but two deputies and a night jailer. And number two, it ain't gonna do a damn bit of good. You can't go around knockin' over stills like 'at. Now, what you got to do is you gotta get that assistant of yours, uh-- - Alex. - Yeah, good ol' Alex, and you take him out and you guys find out who's syndicatin' that whiskey. Then, you'll have somethin'. - You done with this little speech here? You know, you're pretty good at this! You must get a lotta practice, huh? - Well, I used to get a lot of practice, Mr. Conrad. - Now, listen to me, Sheriff. Listen to this, if there is no whiskey, there can be no syndicating, right? So you know what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna burn all the cookers in your county, Sheriff, all over here, gonna destroy 'em all! 'Cause if there are no cookers, there can be no syndicating, and I want Washington to know that I'm doing a job down here, do you understand that? That Conrad, Agent Conrad, is doing a job! (toilet flushing) - I gotta admire that, Mr. Conrad. (Sheriff chuckles) Well, this oughta do for a starter. See if there's anything in there ya like, Mr. Conrad. - Yeah. - Orville? Orville, will you quit playin' with the radio? Now, call up Herman and you tell him I said get down here. Now, I know it's, I know it's his day off, just said I said get down here, now we're gonna make a raid. - A raid, well what, what kind of a raid? - Whiskey (chuckles). - Whiskey, well, what in thunderation for? - Because the U.S. government says for! - Well, in that case, yes, sir. Hey, Sheriff. - Uh, excuse me. - Sheriff? - Hey! - The Utley sisters? Ooh, boy (laughs)! Man, that oughta be a party. (Sheriff chuckles) - Aw, good heavens, Sheriff, I don't believe this! Sheriff, according to this file, you have, uh, you have women operating stills in your county! - Yeah, that's the Utley sisters. They've been operating for ever since their pa died, about three years ago. They mighty good gals, Mr. Conrad. - Good gals huh, Sheriff? - Yeah. - You know, that's downright immoral. You know what we're gonna do, we're gonna hit that one. We're hitting them, we're hitting 'em this morning. - Now, wait a minute-- - No, no, no, no, I've waited long enough, Sheriff! We're hitting 'em now, get ready, Alex! - I'm ready! - You're making a very serious mistake, there-- - Something else you should know, Sheriff. - What's that? - Federal government never makes any silly mistakes. - Well, in that case, I wouldn't want the federal government to think I was uncooperative. (birds chirping over gently bubbling water) (water splashing) Jessie, I'd like you to meet Agent Conrad. He's from the federal government. He's come down all the way from Washington just to see us. Put your clothes on, honey. Now, we're gonna make a raid now, Jessie. I want you to be real quiet. If we can take your sisters by surprise, there ain't nobody gonna get hurt. I want you to be real quiet. OK, I told you they was mighty good girls, didn't I, Mr. Conrad? Orville! - [Jessie] Run, raid, it's a raid! - Think we can make it to the car? - I don't know but I sure-- - Think we can, all right! - She has to put up a defense like this, Sheriff! We oughta wretch 'em, now! - We do, huh? Well, first off, there ain't no defense they can set up. The only thing they can do is shoot at us, and then we're gonna shoot back at them, and we gonna win, 'cause that's the way we play the game, Mr. Conrad. (shotgun blast cracking) (gunshot cracking) (bouncy and twangy bluegrass music) Hey, Mr. Conrad, uh, would you like a stick of Juicy Fruit? It's good for your nerves. - Now you listen to me, Sheriff! Washington's gonna get a full report on you, a full report! - You really ought to have a stick, Mr. Conrad. I always have one every time I bust one of these places. - Oh my God, you're serious, aren't you? - You bet I am. - You would have to park the car right down the road! - There's no place else to put it. - We're sure gonna be open game! How 'bout the keys? - They're in the car. - All right, come on, let's go! - It's them, Sheriff, there they go! There they go, get 'em! (bouncy and twangy bluegrass music) (gunshots cracking) (bullet zinging) - Mr. Conrad, try to control yourself, will ya? (gunshot cracking) - Curtis, who's firing back there? (gun rattling) Hold it down! I'll tell you when to fire. What a dumb deputy! (gunshot cracking) Where? (gunshot cracking) (Jessie gasping) (gunshots cracking) - Orville, where's Jessie? - [Orville] Oh, I don't know. - Well, would you get her, please. Orville really is a good boy, he's just kinda nervous. We ain't had this much excitement in about 20 years around here (chuckles). I'm kinda glad you come up here. Kinda takes the edge off everything, you know? Well, you wanted to go bust a still, didn't ya, Mr. Conrad? Don't you think we oughta get to it? (bouncy and twangy bluegrass music) (car doors slamming) - [Lil] You OK, Red? - Yeah, I'm all right. Didn't go very deep, just stings like the-- (engine rumbling to life) (car engine rumbling over chirping birds) That old fool musta been pretty sure of himself. He didn't even leave a guard. (birds chirping) I've heard this is a hunk of flat fast machinery. What do you think? - I don't know, why don't we find out 'bout it? Hey, the keys are in it! Red, get me a rock. (engine rumbles to life) (engine rumbling) OK, give me jumpin' music! (tires screeching) (metallic crashing) (explosion rumbling) - Yeah, it's fast all right! - Hell, this ain't a bad setup. Could find a helluva lot worse. (Sheriff gasps) That stuff'd burn the hide right off a mule's back. It's got good flavor, though. You like a swill on that, Mr. Conrad? - Aw, Sheriff, you have to be kidding! I read a report in Washington that said there's enough lead in those pipes to kill a whole, don't want it, that'll kill a regiment, Sheriff! - You know, I believe you're right, Mr. Conrad. I'll drink to that. (Sheriff gasps) - Sheriff, (Sheriff coughs) I wouldn't want you to say anything to the others, but, uh, would you mind very much taking a picture of me in front of the still? - Oh, I'd be delighted, Mr. Conrad. - Now, look, you don't have to do a thing with it, if you'll just, just snap this button right here. - [Sheriff] That button there? - Right, and look right through there. - All right, it'll be my pleasure, uh. Hold that for me, OK, now. - Is my hair all right? - [Sheriff] Your hair looks marvelous. - Someone said once that you have to, uh, lick your lips. - [Sheriff] Yeah, that's a good idea, now smile for me, Mr. Conrad. - No, I don't have a good smile. - Oh, Mr. Conrad, you've got a beautiful smile. You oughta do that more often, do you know that? - [Conrad] Sheriff, I know, I know if I have a smile or not, I don't have a good smile, I know that. - Come on, come on, now. Big smile, that's it, that's it (chuckles)! - Wait, wait! - [Sheriff] That's it, that's it! - Wait, you're moving, Sheriff! You can't take the picture when you're moving, will ya stand still? - [Sheriff] OK, Mr. Conrad. - All right, now, wait! - [Sheriff] Big smile, now! - No, I don't have a good smile. - [Sheriff] Big smile! That's it, got it. (shutter snapping) - OK, you didn't move when you did it, did ya? - [Sheriff] Oh, no, I got a good'un. - Don't say anything to the others. - Well, Mr. Conrad? - Yeah? - Your chief's gonna love that one in Washington. (Sheriff chuckles) - I think he will, Sheriff. OK. - [Sheriff] You got any fire, Mr. Conrad? - [Orville] Hey, Sheriff! - [Sheriff] What is it, Orville? - [Orville] Can you come on out here? We're havin' a devil of a time. - [Sheriff] All right, hang on a minute. - Sheriff, that's enough, you better get outta here and stand back and have the others stand back because wouldn't want anyone to get hurt. Go on, Sheriff, I read about this and I know just how to do it. (Sheriff coughing) - Mr. Conrad, if you can get that thing lit, uh, why don't you set it off. - [Orville] Sheriff! - What the hell's the matter, Orville? - Can I have your permission to tie her up? She's just wearin' me plum out! (wood thunking) - You simmer down, young lady. (liquid sloshing) Look, Jessie, if you don't just slow down now, I'm gonna have to take all your clothes off! I don't expect you'll be runnin' around in your birthday suit, would ya? You gonna take it easy now? (fire crackling) (explosions rumbling) (fire hissing) That's a shame, Mr. Conrad. We done ruined the picture! (Conrad grunts) (Sheriff chuckles) - That was the most incompetent piece of bungling I've ever seen, Sheriff! - That's right, Mr. Conrad, but you know I reckon that's why you're an agent for the federal government, and I'm just a hillbilly sheriff. (Conrad thunks to the ground) Come on, Orville, reckon we better go back to jail. (bouncy and twangy bluegrass music) (car engines rumbling) (tires squealing) (engine rumbling away) (bouncy and twangy bluegrass music) - Well, lookee here, we got real special visitors. Aunt Tillie, but the coffee on! Look who's dressed for pneumonia! Hey, what happened there? - Just what it looks like. (rooster crowing) (rooster crowing over twangy bluegrass music) - (gasps) Well for heaven's sake! Why, we haven't seen you since Pike asked you to marry him! Goodness sakes, girl, what's that? - [Lil] Buckshot, they ruined our still today! - I wish you'd get some clothes on. - Never mind about her, just go on and get outta here, boy. I got some doctor to do. - I'm a good doctor, but-- - [Tillie] No, I'm givin' you a count of 10-- - [Pike] She's not intended-- - Get out, I don't care what she is, just get! - Pike, put the car somewhere out of sight. (twangy bluegrass music) (engine rumbles to life) (car engine rumbling away) - Well, good thing that sheriff got ya in the back instead of the front. It sure woulda torn up the scenery. - Aw, come on, skip it, just get it done! - It's all finished now, that's the last one. Now, we'll just get a little ol' bandage on here, and then you can go right back out and raise some more Cain. - We've got a lot of Cain to raise, I'll tell you! What are we gonna do about Jessie? - We're gonna take her with us. - (scoffs) I can dig it! - Not if she's in jail, you ain't! - Oh, she's in jail, that's for sure, but I'm gonna go down there and kick the door in if I have to, but first, I need a couple of things. - Well, if I've got 'em, you can have 'em. - Got any money? - Oh, got three or four dollars maybe. If you need more than that, well, uh, Pike'll give it to ya. He'd give you anything. - I don't want Pike to know what I'm gonna do. - Well, suit yourself! - You, uh, go around and get the car, bring it out front, and I'll be ready to travel when you get here. Hey, if you see Pike, don't say anything. - There we are. - See, what'd I tell you guys, these hillbilly gals are all the way. Hey, bunny rabbit, it's bedtime. You ain't gonna go to bed in that pretty, little dress are ya? - [Animal] Sure, brother. - Now, you just go ahead and make yourself comfortable. We promise not to look, honest. - [Animal] Hey, I bet she'd drop for money. - Oh, yeah. Here you go, honey, he's a nickel, all for you. - Why don't you creeps shut up! - Ooh, she's a wild one, too! If I get through these bars, bunny rabbit, I'd make a woman out of you tonight. - I'm already more woman than you all can handle! - (chuckles) That'll be the day (laughs)! (twangy bluegrass music) - Now just spend the night thinking this over! (bikers laughing) (magazine thwacks on desk) Shut up! - [Animal] Come on, baby, come on! - [Teach] Take it off, honey, come on! You got the sys-- - All right, shut up! (bikers chattering) What's goin' on out here, I said shut up! What's the problem here? (bikers chuckling) - He don't know what we're talking about. Look behind ya, Luther! - Jessie, Jessie, now, Jessie, come on, now! Get your clothes on, honey. - You come and dress me, cousin. - I can't do that now. Aw, shucks, I'm gonna go get the sheriff. - Yeah, hurry, Luther! - [Teach] We'll see ya, general (laughs). - Hi, sweetie. (crickets chirping) (Luther gasps) - Why don't you just hang that thing up, Luther! (phone rattling on cradle) Very nice boy. Now, without makin' too much fuss, let me see you pick up them keys. (keys jingling) - (chuckles) Now, Red, you don't have to come bustin' in here like Bonnie Parker! Come in here first thing in the mornin', post bail, and the sheriff will let Jessie out, you know that. - [Red] Think so? - Yeah. - Maybe you don't know what I did to his car this morning. - O-ho yeah, I forgot about that. You, uh (scoffs), busted up that federal agent a little bit, too, didn't ya? - Yes. - Well, I guess you better force me. - OK, you're forced. - I'm forced. (twangy bluegrass music) - [Teach] Jessie, take it off, Jessie! - [Red] Cut it out, worthless scum, or I'll drown it out with this cannon! - Whatever you say, big momma! - Jessie, dammit, stop right now and get that dress on! - I'm just havin' a little fun! - Now you get them beady eyes off-- - Come on, Luther! - [Luther] Now then, Jessie, be a good girl. Come on outta there. - So long, ya creeps! - Hey, wait a minute, how 'bout takin' us with ya? - Come on, Jessie. - Wait, I got some money, hard cash! Well, 50 bucks oughta take us for quite a trip, huh? - [Red] All right, you've bought yourself a deal. Open the gate now-- - Now, Red, you can't get yourself mixed up with scum like this! You don't know what they're in here for! - And you got 50 bucks? - No, I don't. - [Red] Well, they have, come on, open up! - [Teach] Come on, get on it, General! - All right! - [Animal] Come on, Luther, don't feel bad! (latch rattling) - Come on outta there, scum! (twangy bluegrass music) You think the sheriff was mad about that car wreck, wait'll he hears about this! - Well, maybe he'll know how I feel about havin' my still smashed. Got a car outside, everybody walk out nice and easy. - Hey, what about this mother? - Lock him in one of the cells, we'll be waitin' outside. - Come on! - Hey, by the way, Prince Charles, don't hurt him, he's my cousin by marriage. - Yeah. (crickets chirping) Well, go on, close the door! (rhythmic drum roll) - You know somethin', you know why we came Down South? All my life, I've hated clods like you. You make me sick, right here, right in my stomach! We, we came down here to get us some hillbillies (laughs)! Every time I see one of your faces, I wanna beat it in, I (scoffs), I'd like to choke you til your eyes pop out! (punch thudding) (Luther groans) (punches thudding over rhythmic percussion) Choke, choke, choke! Choke, choke, choke! (Luther groaning) (Luther gasping over Animal growling angrily) (rhythmic percussion) Choke! (Luther gasps) (rhythmic percussion) (Animal mimicking machine gun firing) I got you, I win, I win (laughs)! (Animal shouting) (car engine rumbling over twangy bluegrass music) (police siren blaring) - We better do something quick, sister! They're gainin' on us and fast! - We're flat-out now! - Huh, those troopers will stick to us like a flea on a hound! It just depends who runs outta gas first. (tires screeching) (police siren blaring) - That's one fast machine! (police siren blaring over rumbling car engines) - [Animal] Hey, baby, you got a radio in this mother? - You bet we do! Even gets state troopers' radio calls. - Yeah, well I'll bet they'll be doin' a lot of callin' tonight (chuckles), that is, if they're not ashamed. - [Teach] Ashamed (chuckles), man, if I was them, I'd be mortified. Pretty little old country girl leavin' them sittin' there with dirty faces! - Well, Sheriff Adare brought it all on himself, bringin' that federal man and everything. (tires screeching) (police siren blaring) - [Deputy] Boy, if they hit those back roads, we'll be huntin' 'em til the sun comes up! (police siren blaring) - [Teach] Step on it, honey! - Oh, don't make the drivin any more, that relaxed! - Hang on, I'm goin' all the way! (police siren blaring over rumbling car engines) (brakes squealing) (tires screeching) (police siren blaring over rumbling car engines) (chassis thunking on ground) (police siren blaring over rumbling car engines) - I can't pass 'em, but I'll give you 10 to be bumper-to-bumper! - [Animal] Shut your damn mouth! (Red shrieks) (all chattering) (chassis thunking and rattling) (police siren blaring over rumbling car engines) (chassis rattling) - Ah, open it up, I mean, I got my boot in the carburetor now! (police siren blaring over rumbling car engines) (gunshots cracking) - [Todd] Pile down, we're makin' score, baby! (gunshots cracking) (machine gun fire rattling) (gunshots cracking) (bullet tinging) (Jessie shrieks) - (shrieks) She's been hit! Damn these pigs, stop the car! - Are you crazy, broad, we ain't stoppin'! - We gotta, she's gonna bleed to death! We gotta get a doctor! - If you don't shut up, you're gonna get one, too! - [Animal] Hey, I can't hit 'em! Stop and let me out, I'll hit 'em for sure! - Aw, you're as crazy as the broad! - [Animal] Yeah, crazy, hell, I'll get 'em good! Stop and let me off! - Don't do it, we have to keep goin'! - Now, you do as he says! When he hits the dirt, you better peel out! - [Animal] Now! (engines rumbling over twangy bluegrass music) (brakes screech) (engine rumbling away) (twangy bluegrass music) (car engine rumbling to a stop) (police siren blaring) - That ain't no good down there, not with a machine gun, it ain't! (machine gunfire rattling) (glass shattering) (machine gunfire rattling) (brakes screeching) (metal crunching and rattling) (muffled police radio chatter over rhythmic percussion) (machine gunfire rattling) (rhythmic percussion) (engine rumbles to life) (tires screeching) (engine rumbling away over twangy bluegrass music) - Well, I've gotta admit, things are beginnin' to look up. - Not from where I sit. - Well, (clears throat) looks great to me. - It'll look great to all of us just as soon as we get organized. - Just what do you mean, we? - I mean there's a few things we gotta get straight, right from the beginning. - I guess since you're doin' all the talkin', you, uh, might be considered the head creep, huh? - Yeah, well, Animal and I go wherever Todd goes. That's why I guess you could call him the head, you know, whatever you said. - Just what do you think we ought to do to get organized? - The first thing is you broads. Nothin' could screw up a deal quicker than women trouble. There's three of you and there's three of us, so that makes the deal fairly obvious. This is the way it's gonna be. Teach, you bump with Lil. Animal, huh, if you're interested, you and, uh, Jessie. - And I guess you and I should share tents? - I thought you'd like that. Everybody agreed? It's unanimous. (floorboards creaking) - Well, Red, I don't like to interfere in your business, but I don't like some of these new friends of yours. - (sighs) Imagine that. The old Piker doesn't like us very much. - Nobody asked your opinion. Unless you wanna get bent real bad, cow poke, get your hands off me, huh? - Pike, let him go! (floorboards cracking) - I said get your hands off me! - Yeah, when I'm ready. (floorboards creaking) (tableware rattling) (bikers chuckling) (women snickering) - I said let him go! I can fight my own battles, let me be! (Teach chuckling) - [Todd] You shouldn't have done that, hay seed. You're gonna have to pay for this. - Todd, just forget it! Just forget it, now, what about our car? It needs fixin', can you get it done? - Yeah. I'll have to take it over to ol' Mackray's place. Dave can do it, probably take all night, though. - All right, but just get it done, and don't worry 'bout us, I can handle everything. - Yep, whatever you say, Red. (crickets chirping) - Now, you were sayin' that, uh, you and I are both the leaders? Well maybe we should take a little walk in the moonlight. Work out the details. - That's just what I had in mind. Shall we? (crickets chirping) What are you doin', what are you doin', Red? - Take that grin off your face! - [Todd] Hey, easy, eh! - Now sing! - [Todd] I can't sing! - Sing for me! ♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells ♪ ♪ Jingle all the way ♪ - That was mighty pretty! - Well, it's better now, Red. (strikes thunking) - (chuckles) Just wanna make sure I wasn't lying to Pike! (crickets chirping) (Todd groans) (rooster crowing) - [Todd] Shut up, here she comes! - How's the coffee, Tillie (gasps)! - The coffee's fine, but one move and you won't be! - All right, what's the deal? - I spelled out the deal last night. I made a few assignments and that's the way it's gonna be. Understand? - Yes! - I thought so. By the way. (slap cracking) I owe you that from last night, remember? (Red gasps) Don't play hero, pig! And speaking of last night, I owe you somethin' else! (chuckles) Looks like we got a few minutes until the ol' clod comes back. Why don'tcha enjoy yourself, Teach? - Eh, no, no, that ain't too smart. How am I gonna enjoy myself and watch this old broad, too? (distant car horn honking) - I think I hear him coming now, looks like the party's over, anyway. Take care of them. (distant car horn honking) - Hey, now hurry, what's the action? - [Todd] Just grab the broads, everybody freeze, understand? If they don't, take care of it. (car horn honking) (engine rumbles to a stop) (birds chirping) - Well, I got the car fixed. - [Todd] Thanks for the help, there, boy. - Uh, there-- - [Todd] Seriously, thanks, appreciate it. - I did it for Red, not for you. (Pike shrieks) (strike thudding) - (chuckles) Dumb hillbilly. (kick thudding) (Pike groans) Now, let's get outta here. - Now, uh, Tillie, Aunt Tillie, now, you know we, we killed two policemen, you know that, don't you? You wouldn't tell anybody about that, would you? You know he just beat that man up, you wouldn't tell anyone about that, either, would ya? No, you wouldn't do that. Well, I guess it's OK to go then. Goodbye, now, Aunt, uh. (gunshot cracking) (Tillie thuds to the floor) You take care of yourself, ya hear? (twangy bluegrass music) (door creaking) (twangy bluegrass music) (machine gunfire rattling) (Animal laughs) (twangy bluegrass music) (engine rumbling away) (tires screeching) (tense and moody blues music) - (screams) Get away from me! - [Animal] Shut up! Listen, when I move my hand, I don't wanna hear a peep out of you, you understand? You better! - Why don't you knock off that broad before I knock it off for ya? - Don't worry, brother. - Why don't you knock off threatening people with that thing? You don't dare shoot Lil or anyone at this point! - It doesn't scare ya, huh? - You've got one bullet left, and you're gonna need it when Pike gets here! - Pike, who you kiddin', baby? There's no way I'm gonna need more than one for Pikey. - [Teach] Hang on! (engine rumbling over twangy bluegrass music) (gun cocking) (birds chirping) - I'm gonna need the car, cousin. - Just a second, almost finished. - Well, somethin' happened up at the house. I may not be back, and if not, they're gonna be buryin' expenses. I want you to sell everything and keep what's left for your people. - Why, what's happenin'? Yeah, all right, all right, I getcha. I'll do anything ya say. - Good, now go on up to the house and wait for the sheriff and when he gets there, I want you to give him all the help you can, OK? Now, load up, cousin. - Got, I gotcha, Pike. (hood slams) (twangy bluegrass music) (car engine rumbling) (twangy bluegrass music) (tires screeching) (car engine rumbling over twangy bluegrass music) - Pike, they've still got Lil! - I know, but we can't help her til we get you in shape to travel! Can you take it? - Do it. (birds chirping) (Red shrieks) (birds chirping) (engine rumbling over twangy bluegrass music) - I think we lost 'em. You better get off the main road. (car engine rumbling over twangy bluegrass music) - This oughta get it for now. Hurt anyplace else? - (groans) I heard everything, let's do it! - Well, we're back in the race, let's get 'em! (twangy bluegrass music) (engine rumbles to life) (tires screeching) (car doors slamming) (bouncy and twangy bluegrass music) (strikes thudding) (strike thwacking) (man gasping) - Todd, ditch the Ford, we'll take this one. (car hood slamming closed) - They probably took off down that road. There's a house down there someplace. I'd like it if you stayed here. - All right. From now on, we'll do it your way. Besides, if I tried to walk, my knees would crack. (birds chirping) Pike! Get it done. (twangy bluegrass music) - [Pike] Harry! - I'm hurt, I'm hurt (sobs)! They killed me! - [Pike] No, Harry, don't talk now. I know what happened. - My wife, my wife! Find, trail her, they're gonna kill her, too (sobs)! - Uncle Harry, I'm hun, (Harry sobs) I'll save her. (Harry gasps) (twangy bluegrass music) - It will, won't be hot there. - Well, I've done my bit, now you go make some coffee, and you point that damn thing somewhere else! - With all the arsenal that old goat left around here, we could start our own army. Here, Teach, try this thing on for size. Why don't you guys hang on to things out here, I think I'll find out if it's true what they say about these hillbillies. (twangy bluegrass music) (Lil screaming) (gunshot cracking) (Animal chuckles) (Lil screaming) (Lil gasps) What the hell is going on out here now? - The old broad was walkin' in her sleep, I just woke her up. - Well, hey, I'm tryin' to get some sleep in here myself, so hold it down, huh? - Yeah, good night. Hey, Tondelayo, c'mon, you're gonna get some fresh water. (Lil shrieking) (Lil screams) (Teach shouting in foreign language) (Teach growls) (Teach chuckles) (birds chirping over distant bubbling water) (gunshot cracking) Well, by God, (Animal chuckling) you know, I hit her. - That's all right. - Animal, what's the matter with me, I'm gettin' so-- - C'mon, c'mon, you old crow, get up! - She's just not movin' a bit, is she? - I don't, I think she's gold brickin'. - All right, boys, there. (gun cocking) - Can't take both of us. (gunshot cracking) (gunshot cracking) (revolver plops into pond) (water splashing) (water calmly bubbling) (dog barking) (water calmly bubbling) (gunshot cracking) (bullet zinging) - OK, hillbilly, I'm gonna count to four and you make your play. Either use that thing or throw it in the water. One, two, three, four, that's far enough! One more step and the girl gets it! - I won't need this thing to take you. - OK, hillbilly, I'm takin' the girl and I'm gettin' over the hill! Now, don't try and follow me or I'll have to kill her! - Don't you touch Lil!

Cry it up, cry it up. (Lil sobs) Get rid of it, hey! You know Red' waitin' for us down the road. - Red, she, she ain't dead? - No, she's alive enough to marry me, (Lil sighs) whether she agrees or not! You know somethin', Lil? They say whiskey runners are real mean on a racetrack, so we're gonna have a go at it, and I want you to come with us. I wouldn't have it any other way. Well, first I gotta take care of him.
