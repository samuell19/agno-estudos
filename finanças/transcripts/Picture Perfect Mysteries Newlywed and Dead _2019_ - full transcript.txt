[♪♪] [shutter snaps] [snap] [snap] [snap] [snap] Hey, Allie. I've been lookingall over the place for you. Oh, Noah, perfect. I need a new SD card. Did you get pictures of everything I puton the checklist? Yep... I think so. Uh, the front of the building,the limo, and now the wedding arches. Did I really need three anglesof the groomsmen's boutonnieres? Second ruleof wedding photography-- no detail is ever too small. And what is the first? Never, ever missthe first kiss. Should I be writing these down? [laughs] Stick with me, kid.You'll be fine. [shutter snapping] Oh, on your right. Oh, oh, sorry. Smile. [shutter snapping] How's it going? [sighs heavily] I'm sorry, Allie. It's okay.I-I can shoot this later. How many weddingshave you shot? Oh, too many to count. And how many times have you had to coachthe bride to smile? A lot of bridesget cold feet. I actually once caught a bridetrying to sneak out the window. -Really?-Yes! It's a big day,and there are a lot of nerves. [exhales shakily] Unless it's more than that. It just feels like everythingthat could have gone wrong has. Our parentswon't stop bickering. The videographerwas double-booked. I lost my "something borrowed"and my "something blue." I haven't evenfinished writing my vows... ...And thenthere was last night. [quietly] Yeah. So you heard? Your mom told me this morningwhen I got in. I didn't know if you wantedto talk about it, so... Greg didn't tell you? Mm-mm. Why don't I go shootthe rest of the bridal party, and you have timeto write your vows, and I'll come back? Yeah, maybethat's a good idea. Okay. Here. [click] My aunt gave me this. It's something borrowedand something blue. Thanks, Allie. I'll be back. [♪♪] Well, we have an houruntil the ceremony, so we still needto get the bridesmai-- [darkly]This conversation is over. I don't want to see youhere tonight. Do you understand me? Is that a threat? If you show up,I will not be held responsible for what happens. We'll just...We'll get this later. Yeah. [snapping multiple shots] You know, I'm justgonna fix one thing. Perfect, there we go. You look great! Remember, no detail... ...Too small.Gotcha. All right. [snap]Got it. [tersely]Are we all done here now? Yes. Thank you, Mr. Davis. [hushed] Everybodyseems so tense here. Is that normal? There was an unexpected guest at the rehearsal dinnerlast night. Who? Jenna's ex-boyfriend, Greg. You know, you have a lot of nerveshowing up here today. He's also my brother. Right. [knocking] It's bad luck to see the bridebefore the wedding. I guess we don'tneed any more of that. [women laughing] There's somethingI wanted to talk to you about. I'd rather not do itthrough a door. Is it bad news? Not exactly, but I think it's importantthat you know-- Can it just waituntil after the ceremony? Please? I'd rather just focuson all that's good right now. Okay. You're right.It can wait. See you down there. See you. [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [shutter snapping] [♪♪] [♪♪] [shutter snapping] [♪♪] Oh, I'll take that. Thank you. [shutter snapping] Hi, everybody.I'm DJ Kenny Kwon, and I would liketo welcome you all to this wonderfulwedding reception. [guests applauding] Now, if you would all rise...

[Jenna continues crying out] [♪♪] Hey, I'm gonna take thisto the car. Allie? Yeah. Thank you. [Jenna sobbing] [♪♪] Ms. Adams? Yes? Sorry to bother you. I'm Detective Acosta with the Willow HavenPolice Department. If it's okay, I'd liketo ask you a few questions about what you saw tonight. Of course. Were you taking photosof the first dance when Mr. Davis was shot? I was. Okay, well,if you could get us those digital files, we'd really appreciate it. I can,but they're-- they're too dark,you can't see anything. I already looked. Okay, well, even so,they'll help us as we piece togetherthe events of the evening. Thank you. If you're lookingfor a place to start, you should talkto her brother, Greg. Why's that? Because he killed Kevin. [♪♪] [rings doorbell] [doorbell rings] [calling out] Greg? Greg? I tried calling,but you didn't pick up. Greg? Hello? [♪♪] Greg? Where are you? [voicemail] Hi there.You've reached Greg Adams. Please leave a messageafter the tone. [beep] [Allie]Hey, it's me again. I've been tryingto get a hold of you. I have been calling you,even at your house last night, but I don't know where you are, so call me when you get this. [smooth jazz plays] [phone line ringing] Yeah. Willow HavenFire Department. This is Captain Johns. Hey, Ed.It's Allie Adams. Oh, hey, Allie. I'm glad you called. Oh?Only got a few tickets left over to our annualpancake breakfast next Saturday. Could I put you down for one, maybe two? Do you know, I'm gonna haveto get back to you on that. Um, is my brother around? Greg? No, no, he, uh,he swapped shifts with Baker. He won't be on till tomorrow. All right, well,when he gets in, will you just let him knowthat I'm looking for him? Yeah, sure. Thank you. [lock clunks] I can't remember the last timewe had a homicide in this town. Have we got a murder weapon? Not yet... but the medical examiner was able to remove a slugfrom the body. Nine-millimeter. It came from a Beretta 84. The guests left the venuein such a hurry that there was definitely timeand opportunity to dispose of it. All right, well,let's start with the bride. See if she canget us a guest list. Okay, I'm on it. Take Carlin with you. No. No, no, no, no, no. I-I don't need a partner. Back in New York-- You're not in New York, Sam. Carlin knows Willow Haven.He'll be a good partner on this. Uh... Go. [exhales heavily] What's a five-letter wordfor "cucumber"? "Gourd!" Gourd. Funny bunny! Teddy! Teddy, look! Look at the funny bunny.Teddy. Right here.Right here! Right here.Look, look, look! It's right-- Uh... the bear. Oh, the bear... Do you like the teddy bear? Do you like the bear? Yeah! Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.Smile! Smile! Yeah, oh, that's great, yeah! No, Teddy... Teddy... [bop-bop-bop] Hey, anybody call my cell? No, did not hear anything. I'm missing a tripod.Have you seen it anywhere? No, actually. We might have left it at a job. Want me to call aroundand check? Oh, no, don't worryabout it right now. I have a new cardfor you to download. Okey-dokey, almost done the Miskatonic High winter formal. It's gonna be done in an hour, tops. Great. Um, also transferredthe Davis wedding photos onto a thumb driveand made a copy for the police. Do you still want meto upload them in the galleryfor the families? I don't think that's a nightthey want to remember. Quick, I'm auditioningfor Ophelia in 20 minutes. Which one of these says"beautiful... yet tortured"? What's the matter with you two?Somebody die? It all just happened so fast. I mean, one minute,we were dancing, and then the next, he's... Is there anyone who wouldwant to hurt your husband? No. Kevin is-- [sighs] Kevin was kind and well-liked, and-and none of thisis making any sense, I know. Here you go. Thank you. I'm sorry to interrupt. Jenna, you have a visitor. Allie. [Jenna sniffling] You okay? I don't even knowhow to answer that, but I'm gladthat you're here. I'm sorry. Okay, I thinkthat's enough for today. I actually havea few more questions. We can wait on that. We'll be in touch, all right? And once again,sorry for your loss. Thank you. Is there anything I can do? Hey, um, we're having some troublelocating your brother, Greg. Do you happen to knowwhere he's at? Um, no, I don't. Well, if youhear from him... [grabs card] ...Please call me. Of course. Uh, Detective. I have the photosyou requested. Thank you. Thanks. Do they have any ideawho did this? No. I-I don't think so, but they were askinga lot of questions about Greg. Wait. You don't think he's actually capable ofsomething like this, do you? Believe me, Allie,I don't want to, but I don't know. [♪♪] [click] [thump] Hello? Hello? [floorboard creaks] Hello? [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] Greg? Allie. What are you doing here?Where have you been? I made a big mistake. [♪♪] I went to Jenna'srehearsal dinner. Yeah, I know. What, you heard? Everyone heard. I never meantfor the others to find out. Caught her outsidebefore she went in, but one of the groomsmen saw usand that was that. What were you thinking? I don't know.I guess I wasn't. I don't know what came over me. I suddenly needed to talk to her to make sure this waswhat she really wanted. Greg. Oh, I know I messed up,but I couldn't stop thinking about herwalking down that aisle... And I guesssome small part of me always thought we'd findour way back to each other. Where have you been? I went to the cabin. I just needed to get awayfor a while. Couldn't be herewhile Jenna was... Have you talked to the police? Police? Why would I do that? What? Kevin was murdered. Jenna's your ex-girlfriend? Yes. How long were you two together? On and off for a few years. Had to be hard... Seeing her getting readyto marry another man? Well... that was her choice. Greg, where were youthe night of the wedding? I told you,I was up at the cabin, our family cabinby the lake. Can anybody confirm that? No, I don't think. I was alone. Well, that's just outsideof town, isn't it? You didn't stop to get gas,grab a snack? Help an old ladycross the street? [chuckles] No. No. Just went straight there? Yes. Okay. [♪♪] [door thuds] Just getting some coffee. You're probablygonna need one of these. They only haveartificial sweeteners here. Learned that the hard wayon my first day. I usually justtake my coffee black. You're gonna need thisfor that. Tch. -Thank you.-Yeah. He didn't do it. That's whatwe're trying to determine. Well, who else are youlooking at besides Greg? I'm sorry, Miss Adams. I can't commenton an ongoing investigation. It's "Allie." A hundredwedding guests that night, and you're talking to the oneperson who wasn't even there. Are you sure about that? I am. [door opens and closes] Hey. How'd it go? He told menot to leave town. [elevator bell dings] Well? What's a six-letter wordfor "not innocent"? There's a killer on the loose, and they literallyhave Greg in there for a two-hour interview. Well,he's Jenna's ex-boyfriend, and jealousy's the third-most common motivefor homicide. How do you know that? I'm auditing a coursein criminology this semester. Really? And forensic science! [laughs] I thoughtyou were a business major. Well, I've got some roomin my schedule, and it's actuallyreally interesting. Last week, we tackledcrime scene anomalies. You have a very unique ideaof interesting. Well, I'm just saying,statistics are not on his side. Okay, Greg is notsome sort of statistic. He's a good guy.He wouldn't even hurt a fly. And if Gregis their main suspect, the police are not gonnawaste any time or resources looking into somebody else. We'll justhave to look ourselves. There were a lot of peopleat this wedding, including guests,caterers, entertainers. It's gonna take us a weekto go through all these people. We don't have to. We are gonna lookright... here. Oh, you think it was someonewho was in the wedding party? The killer usedthe first dance as a cover, so it'd have to be somebody who knew the lightswere gonna go out. So someonewho was at the rehearsal dinner? Exactly. Yes? That would include Greg. Okay. What? It's true. [keys clacking] Whoa. When did you take these? Right before the ceremony. You were stilltaking pictures with Jenna. Look at Kevin's dad. Well, he doesn'tlook too happy. What's up with him? Did you hearwhat they were arguing about? Nope. [♪♪] I have an idea who might. Yeah, I heard them. They weren't exactly whispering. Hey, you want to put this stuffin the van for me? Yeah, you'd be happy to help.Right, Noah? Yeah. Yeah, I would. Do you know what they happenedto be arguing about? I only caught bits and pieces. Something aboutthe rehearsal dinner. Hey, Allie.What are you doing tonight? You want to get dinner? You and me?I know a place. Oh. Uh... I just got out ofa really serious relationship, so I'm not looking right now. You don't have to look. I'm right here. Uh, I'm sorry, Kenny. Can't blame a guy for trying. [both chuckling] Anything elseI can help you with? Nah, I'm good. Hey, if this wholephotography thing doesn't work out for you, give me a call. I could always usesome help at these things. Thank you for everything. -No problem.-All right. -See you at the next shindig.-We'll see ya. Hey, Allie! I did catch one thing,clear as a bell. Mr. Davis saidthat Kevin's wedding would only happenover his dead body. [♪♪] [♪♪] Sorry.Have you been waiting long? No. We're a little understaffed,as you can imagine. It's a family business. My parents are nowplanning a funeral. Someone needsto hold the course. I don't want to take uptoo much of your time. Is this the, uh, the lotbehind the firehouse? It is, but soon it will beaffordable housing. That's what we do here--real estate development. We've built half this town. I'm not sure I have muchto add to my original statement. That's okay. I was just hopingto get some insight into Kevin's moodin his final days. Did you notice anything oddabout his behavior? Odd how? Did he seemnervous, agitated? No. He was getting married.He was over the moon. That is,until the rehearsal dinner. When Jenna's ex showed up. Can you imagine? You know... I always hadmy suspicions about her. Really? So you question her motivesfor marrying your brother? Kevin was very successful. He was recently promotedto number two at our company. She stood to gain a lotas his wife. Maybe even more as his widow. You suspect she had somethingto do with the murder? I just wonderif Greg's infatuation with her was only one-sided. Are you saying that Jennastill had feelings for him? Well, why would Gregtry to break up a wedding unless he thoughthe had a good chance to succeed? [♪♪] [Peter Davis] I want to knowwhy Greg Adams isn't in custody. Peter, please.They're trying to help us. I'm sorry, Claire,but this is absurd! The boy created a sceneat the rehearsal dinner. He's as guiltyas the day is long! Believe me, Mr. Davis, we're looking very closelyat that situation. My son was murdered. Someone's gonnapay for that. Dearly! I'm sorry. What have you goton Greg Adams? Not enough to hold him. Keep looking. The Davis family'svery well connected. Deep pockets. The Kennedys of Willow Haven,if you will. There's gonna be a lot ofpressure to solve this quickly. Yeah, but we don't evenhave a murder weapon yet. I know that.I'm just sayin'. Hey there, Nick. Always nice to see you. You too, Sue. How's Billy's T-ball team? Undefeated,thank you very much! All right. That's my grandson. You must be Detective Acosta. I am. Heard you boughtthe old Watterson house, off of Grove? Uh... yes. I did. [Sue whistles and chuckles] You've got your workcut out for you with that one. I'll give you boysa minute to look over the menu. Sounds good. Thanks, Sue. How did she know that? Life in a small town. Must be a bit ofa culture shock, huh? Coming all the way herefrom New York. Yeah, well, to put it mildly. Well, you'll get used to it. Before you know it, you'll be a full-fledgedWillow Havenite. Great. Any tipsfor speeding up the process? Well, to be honestwith you, Sam... I'd recommend the tuna melt. I don't like tuna. Corned-beef hash it is.Sue? A couple hash, please. [Sue] Sure thing, Nick. You'll love it. Yeah. Did Kevin tell you about an argument he had with his dadbefore the ceremony? No, but Kevin wouldtry to shield me from all that tension. So this wasn'ttheir first fight? Hardly. The son of Willow Haven'smost prominent family is marrying a waitress that worksat the diner downtown? It was a sore spot. Wait. Mr. Davis wasreally that upset about it? Things have been strainedbetween Kevin and his father for a while, especiallyafter Kevin's promotion. Do you know why? Not exactly. Kevin was takinghis new position very seriously, you know? I think it startedto create enemies within the company. Mr. Davis turned it aroundand blamed me. You? For what? He said that I wastrying to drive a wedge between his sonand his family, but I had nothing to dowith it, you know? Hey, girls... Can I get you anything at all? Maybe something to eat? No, I'm okay. Thank you, though. We're okay, Mom. Thank you. All right.Well... I'll just leave you to it then. Thanks. -She's so sweet.-Yeah. She's really worried about me. I haven't had a moment alonesince the reception. I'm sorry. I know it's a lot. These enemies Kevin was makingat the company... Were any of themat the wedding? I've had a breakthrough. Hello, Miss Adams. Okay. What am I looking at? Kevin and his dad got intoan argument before the ceremony. He was strongly opposed to Kevin going throughwith this wedding. And? And that's a motive! Okay... Bill Cross. Bill and Kevin werealways butting heads at Davis Development, which is also a motive. Wait, wait. What? I appreciate whatyou're trying to do, but you should leavethe police work to us, okay? We have a witness. One of the catering staff saw a man race outinto the parking lot after Kevin was killed. She described him as being tall, broad shoulders,and sandy-brown hair. Sound familiar? Sounds like Greg Adams. [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [quiet instrumental playing] [♪♪] [record stops playing] [Allie] Perfect! Oh! Oh, that's great. Let's get another! Okay... Um... You know what? Put your hands up.Put your hands up. Whoo! Yes! Oh, look at how fun these are. One more time. That's enough already, Paul.The pizza's getting cold. Come on. Chh-chh-chh! Okay. All right... smile! [snapping] Oh, that's it.That's your keeper. -I love it!-Great. So good, right? Ohh. Um, you know, I would loveto get a picture of the cake. Can you tell mewhere the caterer's set up? Yeah, in the kitchen,through there. Thank you. You know, that wasa great idea, honey-- hiringa professional photographer. I didn't hirea photographer. What? Hi, Beth. [awkwardly] Hi. It's Allie. Uh... I met you at the Davis wedding.I was the photographer. Right. What are you doing here? Oh, I'm just taking pictures and capturingall of life's perfect moments, one photo at a time. Um, I wanted to ask youa few questions about the wedding. Honestly, I'm gettinga little tired of talking about that. I already told the policeeverything I know. I know, I know, and I'm sorry, but if you couldjust tell me, though? I'm doingmy own... investigation. Like a private detective? Yeah, you could say that. Please? I need to know. Okay, but I didn't see much. I had spilled some wineon my shirt, and I was getting a sparefrom my car when I heardthis really loud crack. It startled me. The gunshot? A few seconds later, I saw somebody runout of the banquet hall and down the street. Um... That look like him? Could be. It was dark,and he was running pretty fast. So it could've been anybody. Excuse me, but neither my husband nor I remember arrangingfor a photographer. You didn't? No, we didn't. Oh, I-I'm sorry. I just assumed the officewould have called you. It's actuallyfree birthday pictures with every cake order,right? Uh, I... guess so. Well... fine, then. Anyway, we're readyfor the cake. Thank you. Please, just get out of herebefore you get me into trouble. Oh... the man you sawrunning out of the hall. Did anybody else see him? May, the florist. [♪♪] Hello, Detective. Miss Adams. What are you doing here? I am interviewinga potential witness. The question is,what are you doing here? Although I havea sneaking suspicion I know the answer. Maybe I'm herefor flowers. Are you here for flowers? No. Hmm. Well, since you made the trip, might as wellbrowse the orchids. The owner didn'tsee a thing. Here we are... a housewarming giftfrom me to you. No, no, no, I don't havemuch of a green thumb. Oh, they're succulents,very low maintenance, but guaranteed to brighten upany space you put it. Okay. Thank you. Allie!What a pleasant surprise. Hello, May.How are you? Good. I heard you werein the parking lot the nightKevin was murdered. I was, but as I just toldDetective Acosta, I didn't see a thing, but I know for a factthat your brother is innocent. [overlapping] You do? Well, people are saying that Greg murdered Kevinout of jealousy. I don't believe itfor a second. And why's that? Well, because he wasin the shop a few weeks ago buying flowers,red roses. He looked very happy... [phone rings] ...too happy to dowhat they're accusing him of. [phone ringing]I've got to get that. Miss Adams? Hey! You okay? Yeah. Greg never told mehe was seeing anybody. Well, did he alwaystell you everything? He used to. After our parents died, he practically raised me,but... But? [sighs] I don't know. I guess we sort ofdrifted apart a little over the last few years. Here's a thought. What if itwasn't a new love? What? What if it was an old one? You think he sentflowers to Jenna? Maybe the rehearsal dinner wasn't the first timehe tried to win her back. Oh. Here. Oh, I'm not taking your plant. Oh, no, if it stays with me,it'll be dead in a week, so... It was a gift. It still is a gift. It's just now from me to you. Put it in the sun, rotate it frequently,and you will be fine. [♪♪] Okay, let's reviewour suspects. We'll start...with Kevin's dad. Oh, they had a huge fightbefore the ceremony. He demandedthat Kevin cancel the wedding, but he refused. So you disinvite him to Thanksgiving,you don't kill him. Jenna mentioned there was some tensioninvolving the family business, so there could bemore to the story. Okay. Bill Cross. He's been workingat Davis Development for a long time. Now, all of a sudden, the owner's songets a promotion before him. There's got to besome tension there. As an actress, I'm a studentof the human condition, and jealousyis a powerful motivator. And then... there's this guy, seen leaving the buildingafter the murder. He has opportunity, but the motive is unknown. That looks like Cary Grant. It is. He sort of fit the description. [cell ringing] Greg? Allie, I need your help. Hey! They just showed upwith a warrant. They're searching the house. Don't worry.This is a good thing. A good thing?How do you figure? Because you aren'tgonna find anything. This will only help your case. I'm not so sure about that. Beretta 84, fires nine-millimeters. Wait. I can explain this. Greg Adams,you're under arrest for-- -That's not even my---No, don't say anything. ...The murder of Kevin Davis. You have the rightto remain silent. Anything you say canand will be used against you... Sorry, Allie. ...You have the rightto speak to an attorney. You have the rightto have an attorney present... [car doors closing] [car engine starting] [quietly]He didn't do it. [♪♪] [door bell chimes] Welcome to Picture PerfectPhotography, where every pictureis perfect. Oh, hi. How can I help you? I'm Sarah Davis. Yeah, I-I know.I'm so sorry for your loss. Thank you. I'm here because my parents would likethe photos from the wedding... Just the ones of Kevinand our family, please. Yeah. We'll upload themon the gallery and send you the link. Thank you. Oh, and we can send youphysical copies, too, if you'd like. That would be nice. Have you... seen Jenna? No. Uh, but Allie visitedher mom the other day. I think she's staying there. I just wonderedif she requested copies, too. No. No, I don't think so. [scoffs softly] Why am I not surprised? [door bell chimes] Thank you. No, thank you. I just want to go overa few details with you. I heardthey arrested Greg. We did. Do you think that he did it? We subpoenaedGreg's phone records over the last week. He received multiple callsfrom the same number... yours. I know what that looks like,but it's not what it seems. Greg and Iwere just friends. Just friends? He tried to stop your wedding. He was worried about me. I was undera lot of pressure, and Greg was helping methrough it. What kind of pressure? Well... it's no secretthat Kevin's family thought that marrying mewas beneath him, and I did everything I couldto change their minds, but nothing I didwas ever enough. Well, did Greg know that you were havingsecond thoughts about getting married? I wasn't havingsecond thoughts. I wanted to marry Kevin. Are you surethat Greg knew that? I'm gonna pay you backthe bail money, Allie, every cent. I know you will.Don't even worry about that. It's funny, huh? I was always the big brother,and now... [scoffs] Hey, I want to help you. I just... I need you to be100% honest with me. I am. Allie, it's not even my gun. Belonged to Dad. I just forgot I had ituntil all of this. I believe you.I just... Is there anything elseyou want to tell me? No. No, I've told you everything. I promise! Okay. [exhales tensely] This is a...large plot of land, Miss... Harrington.Eve Harrington. Yes, my father recently passedand, um, [tearfully]...left it to me. [sobs] May he rest in peace. My condolences. What exactlyare your plans for this? Well... you're a development company, so I would like to, um... develop it. -Of course.-Of course. The first step is to set upa time to survey the area. Does... April 16th work? Let me just consult my... I believe I couldaccommodate that. I do havean important luncheon. Um... [coughs] Sorry. Could I trouble youfor a glass of water? Allergies. Bottle okay? Perfect. [♪♪] [shutter snaps] I was thinking-- [♪♪] How'd it go? And they said I didn't havethe range for Ophelia. Guess what Mr. Crosshad penciled in in the last two weeks? "The Firing Line." What's that? It's a gun range. [bell chimes] I can't believeit took all morning to post Greg's bail. Finally, you're here. Is everything okay? I want to show you♪ something... Check this out. Jenna's initialconsultation notes. When we firstmet Jenna about the wedding, this is what she saidabout the wedding party. "Four bridesmaids,four groomsmen." Yep, and this is a shot... from the wedding. Four bridesmaids... ...three groomsmen. So who's missing? His name is Brandon Stiles. He's Kevin's brother. Wait, brother? Fraternity brother. They went to college together. So why wasn'the at the wedding? He came down witha bad stomach flu that morning. So he flew all the way out for the weddingbut didn't go? He didn't wantto get anyone else sick. He wouldn't miss itotherwise, believe me. They were very close. Got it. All right. Thanks, Jenna. Bye. Well, that was a dead-end. Wouldn't be so sureabout that. Meet Brandon Stiles. Remind you of anyone? He kind of does look likeyour brother, huh? [♪♪] [knocking at door] Hello. Hi. Sorry, I'm not usedto seeing you so casual. Well, it is my day off. No offense, but you seem likethe kind of guy who would wear a suite and tieon vacation. Can I come in? Sure. How did you find me? I do all the headshotsfor the local realtors, so just made a few calls. Small town. Hey, it's still alive! Yeah, I-I guess I'm notas hopeless as I thought. Well... what are youwaiting for? Give me a tour. Tour, yes. All right, well,this is my house... obviously. Uh, there's actuallysome great hardwood under this linoleum, so I'm gonna tear it upand restore it. Oh, I know a great contractor,if you need one. Oh, no, I'm gonna doall the work myself. You ever renovateda house before? No. I'm not afraidof a little hard work. [clunk] A little? I was gonna replace it anyways,so, um... If I can just... If I can just show you... the other room. So how doesa New York City detective end up in the Willow HavenSheriff's Department? You've beenchecking up on me? It's a small town. [sighs] Ah. Well... I needed a change, and New York... ...had too many memories. Good or bad? Anyways, um... I was interviewinga witness on a cold case. We had a DNA hit. They wanted me to pursue it, and, well,I drove by the house, saw the "for sale" sign,and... that was pretty much it. Seriously?That's all it took? [chuckles] Yeah. I think it wasthe first impulsive thing I've ever done in my life. Um... but yeah, drove down,got out of the car. I stood right herein the front of the yard. I looked back at the house, and there was justthis sun rising behind it. It just felt... It felt full of possibility. Possibilityand mustard paint. Yeah, the paint. You play? I dabble. Correspondence game? Yes, yes. Um, it's actually meand my Uncle Luis. We've been playing chess by mailfor years. He taught me everything.He's a cop... Well, he was a cop. He's retired now, but he always says chessis an officer's game because you always have to beone step ahead of the opponent. Hmm. This you? Uh-huh. Um, Knight to H6. I would be walkingright into a trap. Sacrifice.Leaves his King vulnerable. Then, in three moves,it's checkmate. You "dabble"? I like puzzle games. Always had an eye for detail. You know, me too... which is why I am wonderingwhat you really want. Is it that obvious? Well, no one's gonnadrive all the way out here just to talk about spackle. Okay, Brandon Stiles. One of Kevin's groomsmen. Well, he was supposed to be,but he missed the ceremony. So you alreadyknow about him? Detective. The day of the ceremony, I overheard Kevin arguingwith someone on the phone, saying notto attend the wedding. I think that was Brandon. -Miss Adams---It's Allie. Sure. Look, I know this is probablyreally difficult for you, and I admire your tenacity,I really do, but there's only one personwith motive and opportunity to kill Kevin Davis, and that was your brother. [inhales sharply] So you're not gonnalook into this? I'm sorry. No, no, I-I'm sorryto bother you. I'll see myself out. [door opens and shuts] [♪♪] [♪♪] Going in? Uh, no. Thank you. I-I was just lookingat the... menu. [phone rings] Captain Johns, hi. Yeah. What? The fire department put meon indefinite suspension. Can they do that? Captain Johns fought for me, but the Davis family hasfar too much influence in this town. The firehouseis like a family to me. It's more than just a job. I can't lose that to this. I know things seem bleakright now... ...but we're gonnaget through this. Have you talked to Jenna? No, I just want to knowhow she's doing. I mean, she's coping... but she's strong. I mean,Jenna's really strong. Yeah, she is. I just wishthere was something I could do, you know, to fix this. I think the best thing for her,and for you right now, is to just give her some space. [sighs] Yeah. Thanks. What are sisters for? Gentlemen. Ballistics came back on the gun we foundat the Adams' residence. It hasn't been fired recently. Well... maybe it's timewe open up the case. Take a look atsome of the other guests. Well, we may nothave the right gun, but we have the right guy. Let's open it up. [Sam] We've spokento a few people who believe you opposed the marriage. Is that true? Can I pour you a glass? No, thank you. Okay. I suspectedJenna had ulterior motives for marrying Kevin. And it seems my suspicionswere confirmed. Well, Jenna insiststhat she had nothing to dowith Kevin's murder. [chortles]I'm sure she does. You don't believe her? I loved my son, Detective, but he could be impetuous. I built this fortune for him... And he was preparedto throw it away for a girlwho didn't love him. Kevin considered cutting tieswith Davis Development. Do you think that's becauseof Miss Cole's influence? Of course I do! She was nothing but trouble since the dayhe brought her home. Mr. Davis, Kevin ever raise any concerns about any business practicesat your company? I'm not surewhat you're getting at here, Detective Acosta. He was learning a new role. -Correct?-Yes. New responsibilities. Anything that he might havequestioned about your operation? [phone rings] This is the funeral home. Excuse me.I've got to take this. Hello? Where'd that come from? Ah, something Sarah Davis saidjust got me thinking. Well, when did you planon telling me about it? I don't know. I'm-- I'm sorry, Nick,I'm still getting used to this whole partner thing. Uh-huh, and how longdo you think that's gonna take? Look at this. Quite the collection. Notice anything? [Nick] One of them's missing. So, how did you getBrandon Stiles' room number? I just asked. That works. How did you knowhe's still here? Oh, Jenna said he wasstaying for the funeral. What if he's really sick? I brought him chicken soup. [knocking] Housekeeping! Look, I don't thinkhe's gonna answer. He's got to come out sometime. What are you gonna do,stake the place out? [♪♪] [knocking] [window whirs] Good evening, Detective. Everything all right,Miss Adams? Peachy. What are you up to? I was on my way to a gigand I got a phone call, so I pulled over to take it, because safety first. Oh. And you happened to stop here, right in front of the motel where Brandon Stileshappens to be checked into? Really? What are the odds? Slim to none, I would guess. What are you doing here? Could it be that you suspectI was right about Mr. Stiles? Is that Thai? It is. I like Thai. So I guess you twohadn't drifted as far apart as you thought. Hmm? You and Greg. I mean, for you to go throughall this to help him out, just... Wow. He's my family. I'm just doingwhat anyone else would. A late-night stakeoutin a motel parking lot? Yeah. Greg has alwaysbeen there for me. He had a scholarshipto a college, and after my parents died, he stayed with mehere in Willow Haven to help methrough my senior year. So he was looking out for you. Now I'm looking out for him. You, uh, you doa lot of weddings? [laughs] Weddings, birthdays,office Christmas parties... If you celebrate it,I shoot it. Okay. Well, for what it's worth,I saw all your photographs, and I think you'rea pretty good photographer. -Thank you.-Yeah. [laughs] Thanks. What got you into it? Uh, well,my mom was an architect, and she would have to gointo the city for work, so she would go see the Met. Oh. I love the Mets! No-- No, the Met. The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Right, right. Okay. Yes. Well, one summer,when I was 10, she took me with her, and I saw this photo exhibitioncalled "Light and Shadows." That changed everything for me. It was amazing! I even told my mom that, someday, I wouldhave my own show at the Met... [sighs] But, you know, "someday"doesn't really pay the bills, so... I just kind ofstick to weddings, and birthdays,and office Christmas parties. You haven't given up,though, right? Someday's just not here yet. [chuckles softly] So do you miss New York? Sometimes. I guess I'm just waitingfor a sign to make Willow Havenfeel like home. It's still new. Just give it some time. Yeah. We got some action. [shutter snapping] [snapping] Must have been a 24-hour bug. I stayed away from the weddingbecause Kevin asked me to. So you weren't sick? No. You were a groomsman, right? You came all the wayfrom Bismarck, North Dakota. Why--Why the change of heart? I'm sure you heardwhat happened at the rehearsal dinner. Yes. That's all fairlywell-documented at this point. Not the best wayto start a marriage. The bride's ex shows up,starts causing problems? Like, who knows whatother secrets she's hiding? Did Kevin knowhow you felt? Yeah. I told him I thoughthe should postpone the wedding, that she wasn'twho he thought she was. She could've beenafter his money. He didn't take it very well. I was just looking out for him. So then he kicked youout of the wedding party? To spare Jenna's feelings. But I'm not the only onewho thought this way. Really? His own father saidhe would disown him if he went throughwith the wedding. So after all that, you still showed upat the wedding hall? Yeah. I felt bad. I wanted to clear the air. And did you talk to him? No. I lost my nerve,so I left. You left? Okay, listen. I wasn't up-frontwith you guys to start, but I'm not lying. I'm telling you the truth now. I had nothing to dowith Kevin's murder. Okay, okay. Let's just get this straight. You and Kevin foughtover his decision to go throughwith the wedding? That's what I just told you. Are you sure that, uh, it didn't have anything to do with the jobthat he offered you, and then recently rescinded? How do you know about that? Detective. Okay, look.It's true. He did offer me a jobat Davis Developments, but I wasn't upsetwhen it didn't happen. No? Not even just a little bit? I mean, it's a pretty good gig at a successfuldevelopment company. Sure is. I'd be pretty upsetif somebody changed their mind. -I would be, too.-Yeah. He was doing me a favor. He was thinking aboutleaving the company himself. And he told you that? Look, he didn't go into detail, but I think he stumbled acrosssome funny business in the firm's accounting. "Some funny business"? What kind of funny business? Like missing money... a lot of it. So what happens now? We're gonna haveto find you a lawyer. Oh, my uncle's a lawyer. I can ask him. Criminal defense? Environmental law. We'll just look online. Yeah. [door bell chimes] Greg. Jenna. I didn't know you'd be here. I should go. No, Jenna. Wait! I need you to knowI didn't do this. Jenna, you know me, probably better than anybody. [Allie] Jenna, you okay? No, I'm not, and I don't thinkI can spend another minute in my mom's house, but I can't go backto my apartment, either, because everything therereminds me of Kevin. Why don't youjust stay here with me? You could alwaysgo up to the cabin. Your family's cabin? Yeah. It's nottoo far from here. It's pretty and peaceful. It'll give youa chance to clear your head. I thinkit's a really good idea. Yeah. Okay. You still rememberhow to get there? I do. Thank you. You're welcome. Harrington.Eve Harrington. What do you meanshe doesn't own the property? Detective, if you're lookingfor Mr. Davis, he's not in. Actually, looking for you,Mr. Cross. Me? I'll call you back. Miss Cole has been very helpfulin our investigation, providing a lot of insight-- guest lists,vendor names... She even gave us accessto Kevin's laptop. I don't see howany of that's relevant. Well, it seems that Kevin wasgrowing increasingly concerned about the firm's accounting. Kevin never had muchof a head for numbers. I'm not surewhat he thought he saw, but... Evidence of embezzlement? -[scoffs]-A lot of it. It's all detailed right here. Mr. Cross, you attendedthe Davis wedding, correct? I'm not answeringanother question without my lawyer. Very well. The hall where we didthe Davis wedding called. Mm-hmm? They have our tripod. That's where it's been? Mm-hmm. Great. I'll just swing byon my way and pick it up. Wait. Where are you going? I have the prints for Sarah. I'm gonna drop them off. You should probablysend them via courier. I have some questionsabout Bill Cross. But she doesn'tlike you very much. Maybe these will help.Think of it as an olive branch. [door bell chimes] ♪ Good luck... [door closes] ♪ You're gonna need it [♪♪] I guess this town'ssmaller than I thought. I'm not being nosy. For once? Really, I cameto get my tripod, but, you know,since I'm here... You'll be nosy? [snaps]You are nosy for a living. Literally!You're a professional snoop. Emphasis on "professional." What are you doing here? I think you're right. I don't think Greg's our guy. You don't? No. Something is just not clickingthe way it should, and I figured I'd come here and take a look at the scenewith fresh eyes. I'm missing something. I know it. You know, whenI'm composing a photograph, sometimes, what I leave out is just as importantas what I put in. I don't follow. I'm sayingjust forget about everything and focus on the detailthat keeps tripping you. Okay. That's not a bad idea. Okay, well, I'm gonna go. Maybe you could help me. I mean, you were therethat night, so... I already told youeverything I know. I'd like you to show me. Show you? Please? So... lights go out. Mm-hmm. Kevin and Jennacome to the dance floor. Uh... yeah, that's right. And then what? Well, they hadtheir first dance. First dance... okay. Indulge me? Oh, uh... Okay. Like this? Yeah. What happened next? They spun around the rooma couple times. Will you lead? Okay. Um... Sorry. Sort of like this... Like that. Um... and then she spun out. Uh-huh, uh-huh... It was right... They ended up right... right here. This doesn't make any sense. The angles are all off. The shooterwas on the right side of the dance floor. Bullet pierced his chest. He-- He dipped her... like this. This would givethe killer a clear shot. Yeah. Okay, Miss Adams. That was... uh...That was very helpful. No, thank you.I'm-I'm glad I could help. -Thank you.-Yeah. [♪♪] Let me make this clear. I intend to sue you and the entireWillow Haven Police Department for this gross infringementof my rights. Kevin Davis was gathering information and evidencethat would have proven years of fraudulent accountingby Cross. He'd stolen hundredsof thousands of dollars from his clientsand the firm. And Crossknew what Kevin was doing? Maybe... but if he did, it would make for a prettycompelling motive for murder, don't you think? I'll pass on the message.Thank you very much. Hi. Hello. I have a packagefor Sarah Davis. I'll be happyto give that to her. Oh, is she in?I was hoping to see her. She is, but I shouldgive that to her. Right, but she's a friend. Fine. Last door on the right. Thank you. [knocking on glass] Allie... What are you doing here? I came to drop off your photos. You could have left themwith reception. I know how importantthey are to you, so I wantedto ensure their delivery. Well... thank you. What do I owe you? No, no, it's on the house. That's my grandfather'sbow tie he's wearing. See how it's a little too big? Kevin didn't care. I'm so sorry. No. I'm sorry. I know I wasn't exactly... pleasant to youthe day of the wedding. No, it's fine. There's something about tragedy that makes youre-evaluate things. I owe Jenna one, too. I stopped by her mother'shouse this morning, but she wasn't home. Jenna's staying atmy family's cabin for a few days so she can clear her head. That's a good idea. Yeah. I think we could alluse a little space. Sarah, I was hoping to ask you a fewquestions about Bill Cross. What about him? I know he and Kevin didn'talways see eye-to-eye on things. Bill is... ambitious. He always has been. [knocking on glass] I'm sorry, Miss Davis. The courierwon't release a package without your signature. Excuse me for one minute. It's okay. [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] You lied to me. What? I asked if there wasanything you weren't telling me. You said I kneweverything there was to know. Allie, you do. I've always beenhonest with you. I spoke to May, the florist. She saidyou sent someone flowers. I assumed it was Jenna,but Sarah? [sighs heavily] We met at a fundraiser at the firehousea couple of months ago. We hit it off. Why didn't you tell anybody? Because, between Kevinand Jenna, we just thought it was betterto keep it to ourselves, at least while it was so new. So what, you guys are dating? Yeah, we were. Took her out a few times, we went up to the cabinfor an afternoon, but... a few weeks ago, I realizedmy heart wasn't in it. That's not fair to anyone,so I broke it off. How did she take it? Not well. Whatcha looking for? This. The bullet came from the right sideof the dance floor... and there's Sarah. Why would Sarahshoot her own brother? I don't know... unless she didn't mean to. [♪♪] What if she wasn'taiming for Kevin? What if the dip is what madethe bullet miss her true target? [overlapping] Jenna! [knocking at door] Sarah? We just gotsome horrible news about Kevin. What is it? Can I come in? Hi! You've reached Jenna. I can't come to the phone now. Leave a message at the tone. No luck? No, she's probablyat the cabin, so she won't have service. So what are we going to do? Email Detective Acostadirections to the cabin. I'm headed up there. -You think that's a good idea?-Probably not. [door shuts] And that's not stopping her. [phone rings] -Acosta.-Jenna's in danger. I think the shooterwas aiming for her that night. -The shooter?-Sarah! Sarah Davis? Jenna's stayingat our family's cabin. I'm headed there now. Noah's aboutto email you directions. Don't do anything stupidand let us handle this, okay? -I got to go.-Miss Adams! Miss Adams! Sam? We got to go. [♪♪] Jenna? [pounding] Allie!What are you doing here? Jenna, I need youto come with me. What's going on? I thinkyou might be in danger. Danger?What do you mean? I think she means me. [Jenna] Sarah? What... Hello, Allie. Why don't youjoin us inside, hmm? [Nick] Go to the left,go to the left! Allie, what's going on? Why is she doing this? Greg didn't shoot Kevin. Sarah did. What? Why? Because the bullet missed you. You were trying to kill me? You deserved it. For making a foolout of Kevin... out of me. A fool out of you? How... She's in love with my brother. You and Greg? You know,when he broke things off, he told me he just wasn'tin a place for a relationship, and I believed him, but then he showed upat your wedding rehearsal, and I knew. The two of youwere nothing but liars. What are you gonnado with us? We're gonna go for a walk. You don't have to do this. Of course I do. My brother is dead. I may have pulled the trigger, but you were the onewho killed him. [gravel crunchingas vehicle approaches] [♪♪] Get up! We're gonna go out back. [screaming] Ah! [grunting] [thumps door]Police! Open up! [crash]Everybody freeze! [panting] Hello, Detective. Hello, Miss Adams. Sam, I thinkI found the missing gun. [police radios crackling] I thought I asked younot to do anything stupid. Oh, did you? I did. Yeah, I-I didn't hear that. Must have beenpoor reception. Of course. Um... Thank you. For having my back. Anytime. Sam! I gotta... I got to get going. Of course. Yeah. Nice work, Miss-- [chuckles] Nice work, Allie. [♪♪] [indistinct exchange] [sighs deeply] So what happens to Sarah now? Oh, I don't know. I guess that'sup to the court to decide. Hope she likes wearingorange coveralls. -Maya!-What? She killed a guy! -[pot crashing]-Whoa! You okay? Yeah. Got it. Y'all just relax. If anything starts burning, I'm a firefighter again. Yeah. Dinner... is served. Hmm. Oh, it's-it's my mom. Yeah. I gotta go home.She's making meatloaf. I can't, uh, miss the loaf. Okay, don't forget-- We have the Taylor weddingin the morning. I'm not quite surethat I'm ready for another wedding just yet. You know,I'll-I'll give you a ride. Yeah, I livejust down the street. It's on my way.It's on my way. Yeah. -See you later.-Bye! Bye! Well, they don't knowwhat they're missing. Oh. Here you go. Thank you. You're welcome. No, I mean... thank you for believing in meno matter what. Of course.That's what family's for. Yeah. Bon appetit. Takeout? Yup. Mm-hmm. I'll get the menu. I will get the phone. [♪♪] [knocking] -Hi.-Hi. Uh, I don't want to bother you,I just... came by to say thank you. Just doing my job. Detective. [laughs] No. I... I wanted to thank you for what you said to mein the car the other night. See, the thing is, I had kind of given upon my "someday," but you were right. I think my somedayjust isn't here yet. So, um... I... I wanted to give you this. Allie, I... -I don't need...-Please. You said thatyou were looking for a sign that Willow Havenfelt like home, and... I hope this is it. Thank you. See you around, Detective. [♪♪] [car engine starting] [♪♪]
