Oh Paul, that's perfect. Hey, guys. Can't wait for a cup. Aw... that goes just in the back, Deb. That is gonna come in handy. The kids are gonna love that. And this is for you. Oh, Sergeant Wilson! Hi! The toys for eight to ten year-olds go over there. Got it. Thanks Danielle. Are Matthew and the boys so excited about the Christmas holidays? Ecstatic. What about Audrey? Oh, over the moon. - Oorah! - Oorah! Sorry, I'm late. The math teachers had a last-minute gift exchange. Ah, it feels so good to be off for Christmas vacation. Doesn't it? Vacation? We have so many toys left to collect and don't get me started on the toy drive party. I don't even have a Christmas tree yet. I don't know how I'm gonna get it all done by Christmas. Yeah, but that stuff is fun. I mean, teaching a bunch of 17-year-olds calculus? Now, that deserves combat pay. Oh, they're here. Let's make some Christmas magic! Santa and his elf are in the house. Ah! Well Pierce, I think you are missing the beard and the belly but we'll take it. Merry Christmas, ladies. - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! Thank you so much for doing this. You guys always come through for the kids. Best part about working for a toy company. Christmas, baby! Let me show you what we got. Oh! We have got the hottest new toys, the kids are gonna love them. Oh! This one is special for frazzled toy drive coordinators. Stress Santa? It's perfect. Oh! I love these things. Oh, make that stop! Can we start bringing these in for you guys? Yeah. Aww, that'd be great, Sergeant. Thank you. - I will help direct. - There we go. Perfect. Thank you. Nice shot. Nailed it! - Thanks bud. - See you in there. Thanks Rick. So where's my other favorite girl? Oh, Audrey is caroling at the retirement home. Right. And are we still on for tonight? Ooh... yeah. The tangled Christmas lights in my garage have your name all over them... should you choose to accept the mission. You are looking at the master detangler. Okay. What about the tree? Tomorrow. Audrey wants you to help us pick one out at the lot. Oh! And afterwards we're gonna set up a collection booth in Town Square. I wanna get as many toys as possible. It is crunch time. Yes and yes and anything else you need me to say yes to? You're the best. Oh... and Danielle? Um... I was hoping maybe we could talk about some things later. Of course. Okay. - I'll see you later. - See you later. Ok. ♪ How was the concert? It was okay. Oh honey, it's the start of Christmas break and you look like... you kinda look like the scrooge! What's wrong? Everything. Oh, this calls for extra sprinkles. Here you go, sweetheart. A girl at school said I'm weird 'cause I'm bringing my mom to the Christmas father-daughter dance. Oh honey. You're not weird. And you know some of the dads are deployed anyway so you won't be the only one there... But I'm bringing my mom. Yeah. And your mom has got some pretty cool moves. Mommy! Do you think Daddy would've been excited about the dance? Oh yeah. Your dad loved to dance. At our wedding, he was trying to do a split and he ripped his dress blues. No way. Yeah way. I think he mostly would've been excited about the special night for just the two of you. There's lots I don't remember about him. I know, honey. - Hello? - Hello? In the kitchen! Did someone call the Christmas cavalry? Yes! Hi Aunt Jane. Hi! Hi Pierce. Hello. Now I bet you dazzled 'em today with your amazing voice, didn't you? That's my girl. Okay. You wanna lead me to these lights? Yes. Uh... can you two get started on the decorations? Mm-hmm. By the time we're done Mrs. Claus herself will be jealous. Okay... here we are. Ooh boy. They are more tangled than I remember. Sorry. Goodness. Yeah, don't worry about that. I just hope I can do the house justice. Hey, you string up five lights and I'd be happy. Last year I stapled my shirt to the house. Now that's something I'd like to see. Hey, it was my favorite shirt! I'm sorry about your shirt. Yeah. Seriously, I'm more excited about this Christmas than I have been in a long time. I'm really happy you're spending it with us. Me too. You said you wanted to talk to me about something? Yeah, um... okay if we wait 'til later? Might be a while, but, yeah, sure. - Thank you for doing this. - My pleasure. You're awesome. Good luck! It is beginning to look a lot like Christmas in here. All we need is a tree. Right, kiddo? Hey, Aud... I have some more decorations in the kitchen. And there might be some chocolate in there too. Okay. What's with Audrey? The Christmas father-daughter dance is coming up and she's upset about Colby. She's started asking a lot of questions about him lately. Kinda caught me off guard. She is getting older. She must be curious. She wasn't even five when he died. I can't believe that was almost three years ago. You know, I was gonna ask... the hospital owes me, like, a month's worth of vacation days I'm not gonna use. Why don't we go somewhere for Spring Break? We could bring Mom and Dad. Yeah. Oh! I see you found the chocolate reindeer. Are you gonna share or what? Thank you. Remember this? I do remember that Christmas. What are you looking for? The bell Colby gave me that he turned into a Christmas ornament. - Right. - It's still missing after three years. How does an ornament randomly vanish? Well you do have a lot of Christmas stuff. I'm sure it's in the house somewhere. Every year I think it's gonna randomly gonna turn up in one of these bins, but it doesn't. Okay, hi! Miss chocolate mustache. - Guess what time it is? - Bed time. Yes, it is. Please go upstairs and wash your face. We'll see you up there. Oh! Pierce is probably freezing out there. I'll start cleaning up. Let him know I'll be out soon. Here you go. I don't want a book tonight, Mommy. Really? Tell me a story about Daddy. This is a Christmas classic. You're gonna love it. Please! Tell me how you met Daddy. Okay. Um... hmm. Well... it was 11 years ago at the Christmas tree lighting here on base. And I had taught here for a couple years already. You would never know you're surrounded by a 55,0000-acre fortress. Five thousand Marines and two single ladies? What's a girl gotta do around here? Oh, hi Dad. Sophia. Merry Christmas, Danielle. Good to see you. Merry Christmas General Anderson. Merry Christmas everyone. I'm Major Colby Aames with the Marine Corp toy drive and it is my honor to flip the switch tonight. This year we have a Noble fir tree, which is considered the king of Christmas trees, because of its stiff branches that can hold a ton of lights. Does anyone wanna guess how many lights are up there? A thousand? Close, 2,000. Are we ready? Five... Four... Three... Two... One. A little technical difficulty. - I'm gonna go help him. - Hmm. Hi. Do you wanna check the circuit breaker and I'll go stall? It's kinda like one of my super powers. Thanks. Hi everyone! Uh... Merry Christmas! Um... so... what do Santa's little helpers learn at school? Anybody? The elf-abet. That's funny, Mommy. Well, thank you. I thought so too but no one was really laughing. There was one person who got my jokes though. What do you call a snowman with a six-pack? The abdominal snowman. That's a good one. Sorry about that folks, I guess Army engineers installed the wiring. I'm just kidding. Let's, let's try this again. Whoo, that was a close one. You're telling me. Hey, uh... thanks for that. I'm Colby, by the way. Danielle. Oh, this is my good friend, Pierce. The new company he works for donated a bunch of toys. - That's so nice. - It's nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Um, I've gotta run. I'll see you at the Christmas party? - See you. - Okay. So... can I repay you with some world famous Marine Corp hot cocoa? Well, if it's world famous... I met Daddy and Pierce that night. They actually became really good friends because of the toy drive. - Cool! - Mm-hmm. We took this photo together about an hour after we met. The first time I saw your daddy I had butterflies in my stomach. You ate butterflies? No, that's when you're excited about someone or something. Like opening presents on Christmas morning? Exactly! 'Cause you know the best things happen at Christmastime. My birthday? Your birthday. Uh, Mommy and Daddy's wedding. Star coming into our lives. It's a magical time of year. Do you have any more good stories about Daddy? I do. I actually used to keep a journal. Do you still have it? Yeah. I haven't written in it in a long time. You know what little lady, it is time for you to go to bed. Okay. ♪ Okay. Oh, hi! Oh, I hope you're not too cold out here. Uh, I am a human icicle. But if I did this right, it's all gonna be worth it. - Oh, thank you. - You're welcome. - Okay. - Alright. Just going to set this down... let's see... Please work. Okay. Oh, it's beautiful! Oh, thank you so much. You're beautiful. Aw... Um... Danielle? There was something I'd like to ask you. Okay... Um... I know that we've only been dating nine months. Can you believe that it's been 11 years since we first met? I was literally just telling Audrey about that night. Really? Yeah. Well, I've come to know you as the most incredible woman and mom. On our best and worst days we always manage to make each other smile... and I want that forever. So... um... Oh, my gosh. Uh... uh... I love you, Danielle. Will you marry me? I... I did not expect this. Can I talk to Audrey about it first? Yes. Yes, of course. ♪ Audrey, honey, there's something I need to talk to you about. The tree? Can I pick it out myself? Yes, you can. But it's something else. You know how you really care about Pierce and he cares about you? Yeah. Well, last night he asked me to marry him. He did? How do you feel about that? Um... I guess it's okay. - He's super nice. - He is super nice. And I know he's never gonna replace Daddy but he is gonna make the best step-dad. - Hi. - Hi. Come on in. - Hi. - Hi. Hi Audrey. This is for you. Aww... I already have a bear. It used to play my daddy singing "Silent Night", but it broke. Colby got it for her so that she could hear his voice when he was deployed. Sorry. Well, maybe your daddy's bear could use a friend. Well, my bear does get lonely when I'm at school. Um... Audrey? Um... Listen, I just want you to know how special you and your mom are to me and that I will always be here for the both of you, okay? Why don't you go upstairs and introduce your bears? Okay. She is taking all of this better than I thought. So, does that mean...? Right. - Yes! - Yeah? - The answer is yes. - Yeah? Well then I'm glad I brought this. Care to make it official? Yeah. It's just so beautiful. Wow, there's so many trees. Which one will we pick? I don't know. Can I help you? Yes. We want something big, like the biggest tree you got. Right Audrey? Yes! It's your lucky day. We got in a small shipment of what we like to call in the business 'the king of Christmas trees.' Follow me. Mommy, isn't that what Daddy called the tree in your story? Yes. Yeah it is, honey. Hey girls, over here! Come on, let's go. What do you think of this one? I love it! How about you, Danielle? Sold!

I... no... just a lotta happy holiday faces. We should get home and decorate the tree. Okay. Sure. The star! Will you do the honors for us, Audrey? 'Kay. I'm gonna lift you up. Ready? One, two, three! There we go. Ah, the perfect tree. It's not. Why honey? We're still missing Daddy's ornament. Did you find it, Mommy? No, no I haven't. What does it look like? Maybe I can help. It's a... a little gold bell with a red ribbon. Colby gave it to me. We've been looking everywhere but I don't think we're gonna find it. You know what?

An elf and a fairy save Christmas with their magical powers. How can you resist? Daddy... tell me about his ornament. Why'd he make it? Alright. It was Christmas morning. About a year after we met. Aww. I love it! Okay. Here is your last one. Our unofficial first date. Look at us. It's the best day of my life, meeting you. Mine too. I have one more thing. It's... it's not really a present, it's more of a commitment. Oh, my goodness! Oh, he's the cutest thing I've ever seen! Oh! He's a... he's a rescue. I thought he could keep you company whenever I'm away. Aww, I love him so much already! There's one more thing. It's... it's on his collar. Wait, are you serious? Danielle... I have never loved anyone the way I love you. I was always that Marine who wasn't afraid to die and... I met you. And you give me a reason to wanna make it home. But I know it's a lot to ask to be with me. This military life can be hard and if it's too much I totally understand. No, no... there are no guarantees in life. Sometimes the best things come from the biggest risks. My mom always said to follow my heart. My entire heart is with you. We met just before Christmas so this felt like the perfect day to ask.

Oh! We're engaged! Is Daddy watching over us? Always, honey. Always. Um... so he knows I didn't brush my teeth? Ooh... you better get in that bathroom and brush those teeth! What's that? Either Santa's reindeer are hiding in the closet or Star got in the Christmas ornaments again. Star! Star, come here boy! Star! Come here, boy. Come here! Mommy! The ornament! Yeah, it is. It must've been under the couch. Which is weird 'cause I've looked under there a million times. ♪ What am I doing? And this batch is going to, um... Grace Community Church. Thank you so much. I come bearing inspiration. I think you are gonna look great in a strapless dress this time. Thank you. Maybe you'd prefer I run out and get some golf magazines? Sure, yeah! Danielle? What is going on? Can I ask you something? Do you believe in signs? Things written in the stars kinda signs? Like someone or something is trying to send you a message. Uh... okay, I think we're talking in code now. Um... do you wanna tell me what's going on there, Nancy Drew? I started telling Audrey these stories about Colby before bed. The first one I told her was about the night we met at the Christmas tree lighting. Oh, it was such a fun night. Your jokes were so bad. I'm sorry, I'm listening. Well, yesterday at the Christmas tree lot, the guy said, "king of trees". I mean, you remember Colby said that. And? And... later I saw a guy who looked just like him in his Force Recon jacket. This is a military town, Danielle. Okay. So how about this one? Last night I told her the story about how Colby proposed to me with that ornament. Well it's been missing for three years. Star found it this morning. Why are all of these strange things happening? They're called coincidences? This is gonna sound crazy but I feel Colby's presence. It's... it's like he's all around me. Okay, look... I don't mean to psychoanalyze but... you did just get engaged. Maybe you're feeling a little guilt on some level? Like you're betraying Colby, even though you are not, of course. Maybe. And it's Christmas. A lot of big things in your life have happened around the holidays. True. Colby... he was your first love. He's always gonna be a part of you. But you are allowed to be happy again. I know you're right. Of course I am right. Okay. You are gonna focus on Pierce and the future, okay? Not some weird signs and things you can't control. It's Christmas! Enjoy this time. Well, that's a really good snowman. Can we hang these on the tree? The more ornaments the better. Since we have a Noble fir, we can hang as many as we want. Just like Daddy said. Hey, Audrey! Have you decided what you're gonna wear to the dance yet? Mommy bought me a new dress. Well, I'm gonna wear a red and green tie with little dancing Santas on it. Cool! Come on Auntie Jane, let's go hang these up. Yeah, let's go put these on the tree. Is everything okay? This is kind of hard to talk to you about. But I, I always want us to be open. Of course. Um... a lot of memories of Colby have been popping up lately. And, I guess, maybe it's because of our engagement and Audrey's curiosity. I'm sorry, this is probably the last thing you wanna hear about. Hey, no, no, no. I miss Colby too. I can only imagine what you must be feeling right now. You know that you can talk to me about him any time. That is so sweet. And I will. But right now I wanna focus on us. We're engaged! Right. You're my fiancée. I think that's the first time I've said that out loud. Have you thought about a date yet? Oh gosh, um... no. I mean, we should also talk about where we're gonna live because my condo's too small and we need to find a good school district for Audrey. I hope it's okay, I actually talked to a realtor friend of mine the other day. Already? Too soon? No, no. I... I just hadn't thought about moving off base. But it makes sense, we should move once we're married. Look, it's okay. We do not have to make any of these decisions today. Yeah. Maybe we just make it through the holidays. You're right. I mean, you know me. If you'll let me, I'll have our retirement mapped out before New Year's. You're okay with Florida, right? Uh... I... I... I'm just kidding, that was a joke. I'm sorry. Oh! Good! Who's this, Mommy? Oh... our wedding photo! That is Jenny. She was the flower girl at our wedding. She's the daughter of one of Daddy's friends from his unit. She's pretty. Mm-hmm. Well, she'd be a teenager by now. I haven't seen her or her mom Lisa in years. I wish I was at your wedding. What was it like? Do you have any more good stories? It was a very cold Christmas Eve. Okay, ready honey. Come on. She's a little bit nervous. Oh! You know what? I'm feeling a little nervous too. Do you think you could help me? Yeah! We could be brave together. Yeah? Thank you. I say let's do this. ♪ ♪ You look amazing. From that first night I met you, when you rescued me, I saw a light inside you that has never dimmed. And on this Christmas Eve, I will keep my promise of a lifetime of Christmases together. I will always come home to you, Danielle. And I promise to always laugh at your jokes. Liar. Who would've thought that a short circuit would've led to a love like this. I cannot wait to walk through this life with you Colby Aames. Are you and Pierce gonna have a wedding? Yeah, sure. It'll probably be small. That sounds boring. Are you sure you're not turning 18? Let's get you into bed. Glass of wine? - Do you even have to ask? - I guess not. This is the first time we've actually got to talk since your big news. How you feeling? Good. A little overwhelmed. Pierce just brought up real estate. Well, that's big. Are you ready to move? He's right. I mean, if we get married we have to move off base. And I'm just a little worried about uprooting Audrey's life. Not to mention the fact that after all these years I still haven't packed up all of Colby's things. Do you love Pierce? I do. Oh. Danielle! Lisa? - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! It's been too long. I know! I am so surprised to see you here. It's amazing we haven't run into each other sooner. You remember Jenny? She's all grown up now. Yes, of course. - Hi! - Hey. I was just telling Audrey about our wedding last night and how you were the cutest flower girl. But look at you now, you're so beautiful. Thank you. I mean, I don't really remember it but I've seen the pictures. Uh, Jenny, would you mind helping Henry with the drinks? Can you sit down for a minute? Oh, sure. How's Audrey doing? Oh, she's great. She turns eight tomorrow. But she still wants to see Santa today so I haven't lost her yet. Oh, sweet. Are you still teaching on base? Yeah, and I'm co-chairing the toy drive again with Sophia again this year. You should come hang out with our wives group. We miss you. Yeah, I know. I'm... I'm sorry I haven't been around to... It's just... too painful to see everybody. Well we all handle grief differently. But think about it. We have dinners and book club. We do things with the kids sometimes too. It's been hard for them without their dads. Audrey has been asking a lot of questions about Colby lately. I get it. Jenny talks about Doug constantly. I try to keep his memory alive as best I can. And Henry's been a great father figure to her, so... Henry? Yeah, sorry, my husband. I got married. What? That's wonderful! Here you go. Thank you, yeah. Uh, Henry, this is Danielle. Her husband was in Doug's unit. It's nice to meet you. You too. - Congratulations! - Thanks. Yeah, four months ago on the beach at sunset. It was small but sweet. Hi. Sorry it took me so long to find a parking spot. The Christmas rush is on, people. It is pure madness out there. Hi. Um... Pierce, this is Henry. And you might remember Lisa and Jenny from my, uh, wedding. Yes. Yes, of course. Hi. These two just got married. Congratulations. Thanks. Oh, wait... are you two...? Engaged... yes. Yes, it's so new, just happened the other day, so... This is great news! So, when's the big day? Or is it too soon? - We... - We haven't decided yet. No. Yeah. Well, you know, it took us the longest time to get settled on a day when we got engaged. Really? It's a big moment, so you know, we took our time with it. Oh, a few of the families are coming over for our annual smores and movie night tonight. We're gonna watch some Christmas classics. Are you free? Uhh... We could go when I get off work, if you want. - Yeah. - Mmmhmm. Yeah, okay. It sounds good. ♪ Hey. Don't say anything but I think the boss wants to throw you a surprise engagement party. What? Seriously? - Yeah. - When? Oh, sometime in the new year. He wants this place to be one big happy family, you know? Yeah, that's great but... you know how I feel about surprises. That's why I'm telling you. Just act like you don't know. Okay. I'll do my best. Come on, Pierce. You deserve to celebrate. You finally met the one. Hey, if we're half as happy as you and Susan it'll be a good life. It's gonna be a great life. Yeah. I hope so. Everything's good, right? Yeah. It's just... it's a little complicated, you know? With Colby. One minute I think she's over him, the next minute it feels like he might as well be standing right next to me. We met one of her old friends today and she didn't even tell her that we were engaged. I just thought she'd be more excited. It's the holidays, right? Everybody's got a million things going on in their minds. Yeah, you're right. You're right. I'm actually gonna meet some of her old friends tonight so I'm looking forward to that. See?

That's a name from the past. How's she doing? Great. She just got married. Good for her. She must've been so happy about your engagement. She was. But it... it was a little awkward. Why? Well, I forgot to tell her about it at first and then she saw my ring... in front of Pierce. And I think he was a little hurt that I hadn't mentioned it earlier. Why didn't you say anything? I think maybe I was a little thrown off by running into Lisa. Soph, I was just telling Audrey last night about her and then she shows up at the coffee shop today... out of the blue. Lisa lives in town, doesn't she? Yeah, but I haven't seen her since the funerals. What are the odds? Dani, this isn't another sign, is it? I... I don't know what's happening to me. Should I be worried? I'm just confused. Hey, you should talk to Lisa. If anyone can understand what you're going through it's her. She did invite me to a smores and movie night with some of the families tonight. You should go! I am. We are. Pierce actually said yes before I had a chance to respond. Well, he did you a favor. My turn! Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas! Just don't put the brakes on the future in search of your past. What's your name? Audrey! I'm turning eight tomorrow. Happy birthday!

Come on Audrey, let's go get the stuff for your smores. Have you ever tried them with peppermint? Oh. This is really nice. I'm glad we came. Yeah, this is great. You know, I'm really looking forward to making our own traditions. You know what? Let's go ahead and pick a date. June weddings always look so perfect in magazines. Okay. June it is then.

I'll meet you inside. - Yeah. - Ready, let's go. This is going to be so much fun. Hey... can I ask you a quick question? Mm-hm. Here, have a seat. Um... was it hard for you to say yes to Henry with everything you've been through? It was hard just to say yes to coffee. Everything reminded me of Doug. I'd smell his cologne. I'd see his face in every Marine. I felt like I was betraying him somehow. That's kind of how I've been feeling. It's part of the process when you lose someone. Henry and I actually met at a support group. He lost his wife and we were going through a lot of the same things. Wow. Pierce and I decided to pick a date and I wanna be more excited about it but... I feel like something's holding me back. I get it. The first time I saw Doug in uniform... I thought my heart was gonna leap out of my chest. The world stopped. I love Henry. It's just different. He's a good man. He's a great father. And he's an accountant who comes home every night. Well, that is definitely a perk. Yes. That and getting your taxes done for free. Oh, so true. I think the challenge to finding love again is realizing that no two relationships are the same. I am so glad you said that. 'Cause sometimes I feel like I'm two different people. One person with Colby and another one with Pierce. This is why you need to come hang out with the wives again! We talk about all this stuff. Maybe I should.

Well, it was almost Christmas. You were early and Mommy was not ready. Good morning. Let's take a look at your forecast. We can expect up to 18 inches of snow, approaching the all-time record for Virginia. Folks, this could leave us with a blanket of the white stuff that could last until Christmas. Did you just hear that? Colby's plane is supposed to land any minute. They're the military. I'm sure they can land anywhere. Ah!

You are a terrible driver in the snow. Okay. I won't take that personally. Jane... I think my water just broke. Okay, I'm gonna call the ambulance. Hello? My sister is in labor. I need an ambulance to 4843 Flagtop Drive on base. I understand. Please hurry. Ah! They're coming as fast as possible but the roads are really bad. Um... call Colby. Hello? Colby? Did you land? I can't hear you! Did you land? Yes. Jane, is Danielle okay? She's having the baby! She had the baby?! Colby! It's happening! My water broke. Don't worry, I'm coming to you. I'll get you to the hospital. ♪ Where is the ambulance? I don't know. Where's Colby? The snow hasn't stopped. It's Colby. I'm here. - Oh! - Let's go. Come on. Oh, I'm so happy to see you. Look at her. Have you ever seen anything so perfect? She's us. Beautiful like her mother. And patient like her daddy. Thank goodness she waited. It'll be our first Christmas together as a family. Your daddy was always saving the day. He could get out of any jam. Mommy? Yes, sorry honey. I was just thinking about all the things I have to do for your birthday party tomorrow. You better get some sleep. Falling asleep... now. Good night, honey. And the weather is next... Sometimes we in the weather business get things wrong. This snowstorm seems to have come out of nowhere. And get this, it'll disappear just as fast as it came.

Yes. Like... 16 candles? Danielle? You're a million miles away again. What's going on? Sorry, I was just, uh... I was just thinking about the snowstorm this morning. Yeah, what about it? Well, we live in Virginia. We hardly ever get weather like this in December. It's winter. These things happen. I know, but... Last night Audrey and I were talking about the day she was born. Do you remember how bad the weather was that day? You almost didn't make it to the hospital in time. Where are you going with this? Don't you think it's strange? That of all days, today, all this snow. It's like the universe or... or Colby is speaking to me. And saying what exactly? Has it ever bothered you they found every Marine in Colby's unit except him? Because it bothers me. Sweetie... please don't go down this road again. You're doing so well. I just wish I had closure. You know, like the other families. Not knowing where Colby is still? Look, I can't even pretend to understand how hard this is for you. But we know he's not alive. What if he's trying to tell me something? Like he's still alive... Danielle? Let's say he did survive the actual crash. What happened next? They went down in the Gulf of Aden, that's... that's bigger than the state of Florida. Well, well... we've, we've all seen Cast Away and he survived. That was a movie, Danielle. People don't actually survive on deserted islands talking to basketballs in real life. It was a volleyball. Why don't you go speak to my dad again. What did he say back when it happened? He told me everything he could. Well talk to him again. Doesn't he have an entire military base to run? Not deal with my problems. He's in charge of a thousand Marines. He's heard it all before, okay? And besides... you're like family. Maybe it could help. ♪ Alright. It's almost time! Hi. Auntie Jane, you made it! I got someone to cover for me at the hospital. I wouldn't miss this for the world. Perfect timing. You ready? Yeah? ♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪ Happy birthday, dear Audrey. ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you. Go, go, go! Last one! One more, one more! Yay! Okay, Audrey. Before I go I have one more gift. 'Kay? Close your eyes. Oh... do not look. Okay. Open 'em! - Wow - It's beautiful! It's blue topaz, it's your birthstone. Brilliant, icy blue. I love it. May I put it on you? Here, let me help, honey. There you go. Oh... wow. Let me see. Aww. It looks so good. Why don't you go wash up? I'll be right behind you. Oh... That was so thoughtful of you. You know what? I actually had a lot of fun shopping for her. Hey, um... what were you and Sophia talking about earlier? When? Uh... in the hallway when she brought the cake. It seemed a little intense. Right. Um... remember I told you about all the memories and things I've been going through lately? Yeah. Things have been happening. Like signs... or something. Maybe it's because of Christmas or because Audrey's been asking more questions about her dad. It's got me out of sorts. And I am so sorry, it's not fair to you. Hey, no, that's okay. How can I help? I love that you're always here for me. Right now I... I know it's a lot to ask but maybe just if you could just have some patience with me. Yeah. Yeah. I'm gonna go talk to General Anderson about the crash. Is there something new? I don't know. I haven't checked in with him in a while. Since they never found Colby I thought I would... ask some questions, get an update. Oh. Okay. Danielle... are we okay? Yeah. I think so. I mean, yes. Hey... of course. It's just something I need to do for myself. Thank you. Of course. Only five more days 'til Christmas. Daddy brought me this bear for my birthday, didn't he? Yeah, he did. He sat right in that chair and recorded "Silent Night". Why doesn't my bear play anymore? Probably 'cause we played it too much. Well, maybe it just needs new batteries. I already tried that but I'll try again. You know what? Why don't... why don't I sing to you tonight? Okay. ♪ Silent night ♪ Holy night ♪ All is calm ♪ All is bright ♪ Round yon virgin, mother and child ♪ Why won't you work? Ugh. And why am I talking to a bear? Thank you. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, General. Have a seat. It's nice to have someone to talk to who doesn't have to salute me. I hear you got engaged to Pierce Hammond. Oh... - Congratulations. - Thank you. When's the big day? Next June we think. Audrey and I are gonna be moving off base. You'll keep teaching for us though, right? I'm still sorting things out. I hope so. Sophia says you have questions about Colby's incident. I do. May I ask why the questions now? It's been over three years. Well, Audrey has her Christmas father-daughter dance coming up and it's brought up a lot of discussions. I'm sure it has. Sir, I remember the day you pulled into our driveway like it was yesterday. I admired your strength. Thank you. I tried for Audrey. When it happened, I was so full of grief. It was all I could do to keep my head above water. I was not thinking clearly at all. So could you please describe to me again exactly what happened? Well, it was nighttime when a surface to air missile hit the aircraft over the Gulf of Aden. Nine men from the unit and two pilots were found strapped in their seats. Colby was not in the plane, as you know. Is it at all possible he was captured? The insurgents publicly claimed responsibility for all the deaths. Maybe they didn't know Colby was there? Um... what if he swam to safety somehow? The aircraft was found miles offshore. I mean, the most likely outcome is that he was swept into the open water. I thought I was okay about Colby's passing but... I don't know. Something doesn't feel right. Danielle, I'm sorry but every piece of intelligence tells us that Colby's gone. That's why the military officially declared him dead. Colby was a hero. Embrace the good memories you had with him... and share those with Audrey. I think this is exactly what I needed to hear. There's my girl! Hi Sergeant. Hi mom. I did not think this place could get more festive. We aim to please! How'd it go with my dad? Good. It was stuff I had heard before but he really helped put it into perspective. I'm so happy to hear that. So we're done with the cosmic Christmas? Yes. Like you said... coincidences. Mommy, I wrapped so many toys. Nice! Did you have fun with Sophia? Wait a minute. Ah... let me guess. Candy canes, candy canes and more candy canes. That is classified information. - It's also a tongue twister. - Yup. Can Sophia come over tonight? Oh, I actually have a date. Who is the lucky fella? You know the football coach at school? His brother. That's a random connection. Let's hope it's a love connection. He's taking me to an ugly Christmas sweater party with his friends. And if it goes bad, I'm going to text you the code word 'jingle' and you're gonna call me right away with something very important you need my help with. Do not listen to that. You, my dear, are gonna stay home with Auntie Jane 'cause Mommy is going to Pierce's holiday work party. Yay! Oh, well don't miss me too much. So, I... I told your dad how we're going to be leaving the base and how Pierce is already looking for houses and a new school for Audrey. Wait, you're not gonna keep her at the base school? It feels like we need a fresh start. You're still gonna teach here, right? And the toy drive? There are so many memories here. I think we need to move forward. But you love the school... and you've made such an impact on the kids and the community. Maybe I can do that with new kids. Find a new place to volunteer. Yeah. ♪ We are so excited for you two. - Aw, thank you. - Thank you. Yes, I'm a very lucky man. Oh... yes! Pierce has good taste. Doesn't he? So where's the honeymoon? The best part about getting married. We have not figured that out yet. I've been looking at some beach destinations actually. There's nothing better than relaxing on a beach with a good book, right? So, thank you for another great year. From the designers to the sales team. You're the best in the business. And we should be so proud of how much this company has grown. Whoo! Now, I can't leave you without one of my signature Christmas jokes. Oh boy. What did the gingerbread man put on his bed? A cookie sheet! We have a winner! Pierce, she's a keeper! Alright, everyone have a great night. Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. I'm sorry, his jokes are so annoying. Thank you for indulging him. I actually thought it was kinda funny. You know what? I'm going to go use the restroom. Sure. I'll get us another drink. Okay. Two more of those. Well, Danielle made you look good with the boss. Yeah. Everything okay? I think so. I don't know. She went to see General Anderson again today. Okay. She's been dealing with a lot of Colby stuff. Like what? Questions about his death. I think a lot of it is coming from Audrey which is stirring up a lot of old feelings for Danielle. Any concern that's code for cold feet? To be honest, I was worried about that. But then Danielle just picked a wedding date and she said she wanted to look for houses together. What do you mean? That's great! Sounds like everything's on track. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. Yeah. You know what, I've been meaning to ask you... if you would be my best man. - Seriously? - Yeah. Yes! - Awesome, man. - Thanks, man. Did I just hear best man? You're looking at him! Aw, that's awesome! Thanks Rick. Anything for this guy. Oh, actually... is it okay if we get going? There's a couple people I'd like you to meet actually. Well I told Audrey I'd be home in time to put her to bed. And I just got a text from Sophia, she wants me to rescue her from this date she's on. I think it's kind of a 911 situation. Oooh, that bad, huh? I am so glad I'm not in the dating scene anymore. Who are you telling? When, when Susan and I were dating, it was all flowers and candy. Now you need like a million dating apps for every mood, right? Thank you for taking me out of my misery. I would never last. Okay, let's get you home. Oh, great. Alright, well good seeing you, Danielle. Aw, you too. 'Night. Good night. And I will see you tomorrow. Last day before Christmas break. Cannot wait. Thank you for a fun evening. Danielle... we do not have to go to the beach for our honeymoon. I should've checked with you. I'm so sorry. It's okay. The beach is relaxing, like you said. And I could use more of that. You're not having second thoughts, are you? About the vacation? No. No. About getting married. No. I haven't told you how grateful I am for you, how wonderful you are. And how thankful I am you haven't gone running, with all my baggage. You are more than worth it. Thank you. I've been so wrapped up in my own stuff I haven't asked how you're doing. You know what? I'm feeling a lot better now. I love you, Danielle. I love you too. - Good night. - Good night. ♪ [Nocks on door] Hi honey. Seems like you and Auntie Jane had fun tonight. Mommy, when's the last time you saw Daddy? Oh honey, it's late. We can talk about it tomorrow, okay? Please Mommy. Okay. Um... he was on that last mission overseas when he called me. We're flying to a new location tonight. Be safe, okay? Always. I want you and Audrey to know how much I love you. We love you so much. Can't wait for you to get home. I left something for you. You'll find it in the- You... Colby? Colby, you're... What was it, Mommy? I don't know, honey. I've replayed that conversation in my head so many times. I remember when Daddy left I asked him for a baby brother or sister. He told me yes. And then he said he would move heaven and earth to come home to us. Maybe he's still trying, Mommy. Daddy will always be with us. But right now let's you and I focus on what a great Christmas we're gonna have. 'Cause before you know it, it's gonna be Christmas Eve... and guess who's gonna be here? Santa Claus! Okay you, tuck in. Good night, honey. Good night. Oh, thank you. Audrey told me you've been telling her bedtime stories about Colby. Yeah. I was really struggling with it at first. But now it's easier. I actually just told her about the last time I saw Colby. Remember how every time he deployed he'd tell me that if he didn't make it home he was okay if I moved on. Yeah. Must've been so hard for him to say that to you. Do you think he would approve of me and Pierce? Definitely. Colby would've wanted you to be with someone that treats you like gold. And he does. It's just that with Colby I never had any doubt. I didn't know you were struggling so much. Honestly, I have been feeling a little crazy lately. You're the most rational person I know and if you're feeling something, it's for a good reason. Thank you. Mind if I go for a quick walk? Go for a long walk. Clear your head. ♪ I never stopped loving you. I can feel you here with me. It's almost like the first night we met. I hope you're okay with me marrying Pierce. It's just, it's hard for me because it feels like... like I'm saying goodbye to you.

Good question. Why does life have to be so hard sometimes? You'll make the right decision. - Hi. - Hi. You look beautiful as always. Oh. I got your favorite. Thank you. - Pierce, I think... - Danielle, there's something... I'm sorry, you go first. No, no. Please. I've been thinking about what we both want. You know, I'm dreaming of the perfect house and planning for retirement whereas I'm not even sure you're ready to leave the base. I wonder if we're in two different places in our lives. I'm wondering the same thing. Pierce, I... I want you to know I wouldn't trade what we've had for anything. Without your friendship, your love over these past few years... I honestly don't know how I would've made it through. I am forever grateful. We're good at being friends, aren't we? It's easy to see why we thought we could be more. I'm sorry. Don't be sorry for being you. And I won't be for being me. I just, I wanna be with somebody who wants to shout from the rooftops that we're in love. You deserve that. Did you still want me to take Audrey to the father-daughter Christmas dance if it's not too awkward? Thank you, really. But I think I need to take her myself. But I hope you'll still stay part of our lives. Audrey, of course, adores you. Me too. You're not gonna get rid of me that easily. Auds... what's going on? I don't wanna go to the dance tonight. Aw, honey. I know it's been tough lately. We've been finally talking about your daddy and we should've been doing that all along. That's Mommy's fault. I was trying to push the pain away by pretending it wasn't there. And I realize now that wasn't right. And I have you to thank for that. Really? Honey, there's something else I wanna talk to you about. Pierce and I are not gonna get married anymore. Why? I like Pierce. I do too. And he cares about you so much, he always will. So, does that mean I don't have to go to the dance? I think we should go like we planned, together. But what if the girl I told you about says I'm weird? What kinda person is she? Not a very nice one. Exactly. You and I are gonna march through this world together, holding hands. Yeah. And I am gonna be with you every step of the way. And if I have to tell you a bedtime story about your daddy every night until you graduate for college, I will. So what do you say? Yes. You're ready to put your dancing shoes on? Yeah? Okay. Oh... So we're looking at a white Christmas, folks. I'll have more on the falling temperatures later in the hour. Back to you, Scott. - The dance is on. - Yay. This just in.

I have to talk to General Anderson. Sophia? Hi. I need your help again. General Anderson, hi. Thank you so much for calling me. Sophia tells me you have questions about the mission. The one on the news? Yes. General, is it possible that one of the prisoners they rescued knows what happened to Colby? So, that we can recover his body? Danielle... according to the intelligence I've received, no US military members were being held captive at that compound. The prisoners were all foreigners. Is it possible someone can talk to them? It's not how these things work, it's just not that simple. Danielle, I'd love nothing more than to bring you closure. I'm sorry.
