So when was the last time you did something crazy? Crazy? What do you mean? Ah, okay. Wild. Wild? Okay. Okay, let's say "unexpected." When was the last time you made a decision that surprised even yourself? Okay um... I feel a little on the spot right now. No, no, no, no, no. I'm not trying to do that at all. I'm just curious. That's all. - What about you? - What about me? Can you answer that question? Moving here, to Atlanta. Surprise answer, right? Interesting. I started a business, I built my house. I took a risk. What? Well, now I feel like the boring one. Kendra, you are not boring. I think you're amazing, in fact. So, you wanna get another drink? Or maybe we get outta here. Go back to my place? Come on inside. Come on. It's beautiful. Ah, thanks. I like it. You know, I built so many homes for other people, eventually just built my own. Well, it's perfect. Hey, um... How about a fire? That sounds nice. Okay. I'm gonna go get changed outta these clothes and get a few logs from out back. - Okay? - Okay. Just make yourself at home. There's a bottle of wine here. It's from a, a little vineyard in Italy. You know, I go about once a year. And if it's not too forward, I'd like to take you with me next time. How's that sound? Hey, you okay? I need to go home. You sure? Yeah, I'm, I'm sorry. No, don't be. No need to explain. Yeah? Stay for a little bit? It's cold out. I mean... I'll, I'll call a car. - Well? - Yeah. There it is. I had a great time. I did too. We'll talk later. Oh man! Hey kid. Oh, god mom. Don't do that. Sorry. What are you up to? I think some birds started building a nest in my birdhouse. I'm trying to fix this so I can watch. You never cease to amaze me. You left your skateboard in the driveway. Oh, right. Sorry. Yeah. Don't let it happen again. Why are you dressed like that? Like what? Like that. Just went out with Samantha. Where's your Dad? I don't know. He said he had to go out. Out where? I don't know. Hey. Where have you been? Had to take care of some things at the office. This late? Yeah. This late. How was your night out with Samantha? It was fine. What'd you girls do? Nothing. Just went out for drinks. You okay? Yeah. Just tired. Morning. Oh, remember I have clients in town. So I'll probably have a late night. Langston's sleeping over at Will's, so Samantha's stopping by. At least I won't be alone. I thought you saw Samantha last night. Uh yeah, but it's our show tonight, so... Can't watch it without her. Right. Let's go, Langston! Coming. He's putting a camera in the birdhouse so we can watch the birds build a nest. Camera in the birdhouse? I think it's cute. Oh, morning kid. You hungry? No. Well, at least take a banana for the road. I said I'm not hungry. Okay. Take the banana. You'll want it later. Have a good day. Or not. May I take your order? Any specials today? Yes, we have seafood linguini. You know what? I, I, I'll just stick with my regular. Stuffed avocado. - Okay. - Uh, thanks. Hey. Hey, what, what are you doing here? I was... kinda hoping to run into you here, actually. I did go on about this place, didn't I? Yeah, you did kinda. Hey, do you have a minute to talk, maybe inside? Yeah. Uh, sure. - Hi. - Hey, what's up? I wanted to apologize to you, for last night. Apologize? Why? I felt like I was pressuring you to do something you didn't wanna do. No, no. You did not pressure me at all. No? Okay. Good, good. Because I still want us to be friends. Yes. Friends. Yeah. I know you and Peter are going through a rough patch. Yeah. I hope you make it through it. Yeah? If you ever need me, you have my number. Alright? Anything. I really appreciate that. Yeah, of course. I'll see you around. Okay. See ya. Yeah. Wow. Look at you, so handsome. This a new shirt? Yeah. And cologne too. You sure you're seeing clients, and not going out on some hot date? Do you really think I would do something like that to you? Come on. I'm teasing. I'm sorry. I'm just really nervous that the guys are gonna tell me that they are thinking of hiring a new law firm to rep them. Why would, why would they do that? I don't know. Just a feeling. They're lucky to have you, just like I am. Don't forget that. - Okay? - Okay. I'm gonna go take Langston to Will's, but have fun and text me, let me know how it's going. Okay. I love you. I love you too. So, how was school today? You already asked me that. And you didn't answer me. It sucked. How come? 'Cause it always sucks. Well, I'm trying to figure out exactly why it sucked today. ♪ Oh crazy ♪ Mom! I'm serious. I wanna know. Do we have to do this right now? Yes. The classes are boring, the teachers don't know what they're talking about and the students are broken up into these stupid little clicks just like those stupid '80s movies you love. I tolerate a lot of teenage angst, but I will not have you bad mouthing my taste in classic cinema. Is that a smile? Oh, Mama's still got it. God, Mom stop. You're so embarrassing. Damn right. - Hey guys. - Hey Heather. Good to see ya. Come on in. - How's it going? - Good, good. 'Sup bro? Aw. I remember when he used to cry when I'd drop him off 'cause he'd missed me too much. Oh my god. Don't get me started. They are growing up way too fast. I'll pick him up tomorrow. Late morning okay? Yeah, sure. We'll be here. You know your contractor was over here this morning. - Oh, uh, Erik? - Yeah. Thanks for the recommendation. He had some great ideas about how to fix up the house. But my god, Kendra. You didn't tell me he's so hot. Yeah, he, he's a, he's a good looking guy. If I tell you something, will you keep it a secret? Sure. He made a pass at me. Really? Yeah, we made out. You and Erik? On the couch for like half an hour. Can you believe it? Good for you. Do you think I should text him or just keep it cool? - Text him. - Really? Yeah. Why not? I gotta go. Yeah. I'll, I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. Okay. Wait, are you serious? You met Erik for drinks? Yeah. Well we, we just talked. It was nice. Nice. Okay. What are you not telling me? Okay. He invited me back to his place. His place? I went inside and I guess I came to my senses because I just left. You just... left? Yeah. - Nothing happened. - Nothing. Nothing happened. Well that's good. Cheating on TV always looks like fun, but in real life it must be exhausting. I, I couldn't do that to Peter and I got confirmation today that that was the right decision. What do you mean? Well, Heather told me something. Heather. Oh, come on, Kendra. You and Heather cannot have a secret that I don't know. You two are barely even friends. Erik went over to her place to try to get some work. And she told me he made a pass at her and they made out out. I guess I'm not as special as I thought I was. Well, it's a good thing you didn't sleep with him. 'Cause then I would be the home wrecker since I introduced you two. Very true. I'm gonna move on to that other bottle. Oh, no more for me. Fine, suit yourself. - I'll be right back. - Okay. What are you doing here? What is your problem? What time is it? It's late. How'd it go? You didn't text me. Well, I didn't get fired. So, I'd call it a win. Do I get to say, I told you so? Come to bed. Yeah. - Hey Kendra. - Hey. Langston, your mom's here. So, how did it go last night? Lots of pizza and video games. As expected, I barely even saw them. Hey, there he is. Oh, Langston. Thanks for having me. You're very welcome, Langston. It was good to see you. We'll have Will over next time. Have a great day. You too. Oh, by the way. Thanks for the advice last night. - Bye. - Bye. Can I get another dog? Where did that come from? I don't know. We already talked about this. I miss Charlie too, but I'm not ready to go through that again. Tell me about last night. What did you guys do? Nothing. Nothing? So you literally just did nothing all night? We played video games. Well that sounds fun. God Mom, stop! Stop what? It was not fun. Why? 'Cause me and Will aren't even friends anymore. What, what do you mean? He makes fun of me at school. He does? Why? I don't know. I'll ask his mom about it. No, no. Okay? Do not do that. Okay. Stay here. Officer, what happened? I'm not a liberty to discuss that with you, ma'am. Is that Erik Curry, the man who lives here? Honestly, ma'am I don't know. Are you okay? Let's go. Hey buddy. How was your night? It was okay. Grab your football. Let's go to the park. Go long. Oh, okay. We just saw something. What? It looks like somebody died at Erik Curry's house. Our contractor? Yeah, they were, they were bringing a body out, but they wouldn't tell me who it was. Oh my god. You still have his number? We should check in with him. No. Yeah. I, I tried, it went straight to voicemail. I'm getting really worried. Okay. Why don't you come with us? No, I, I wanna stay back. I just wanna try to figure out what happened. Well, maybe I should stay here then. No just, just go. Get some exercise, alright? I'll let you know what I find out. - You sure? - Yes. Okay. Come on buddy. Let's go. Can you pick me up out front? I'm gonna go check on the bird house. It looks like they're making a nest. Good to be a kid sometimes. Yep. Let's go, Langston! Heather. Hey. Hey, I heard there's something going on over at Erik's house, but I can't get ahold of him. Do you know anything? I don't know. They, they were taking out a body. A body! Oh my god. Did you end up texting him last night? Yeah. - And he was okay? - Yeah. I, I, I think so, but... Oh, that's Samantha. I need to take this. Let me know if you hear anything? Yeah. I, I will. - Hey. - Hey. It was him. Erik is dead. There's a lot I need to tell you. I'm coming over. Okay. They haven't officially confirmed his identity yet, but, it's Erik. Shelli Merrill's husband is a cop and she heard it straight from him. But what happened? I don't think they know yet. I just, I don't understand. He was so young and healthy. Sometimes you just never know. Maybe he had a, a sudden heart attack or something. I don't know. I'm, I'm just guessing. You know, we... we got really close while he was working on the house. I don't know. I guess I didn't really wanna admit it to myself, but... We had a connection. At least I thought so. I know that Erik and I never actually did anything, but it just feels like it's the secret that I can't talk to anybody about, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Totally. That must be really weird for you. I just, I was just so sad. You know? I can't believe he's gone. I'm sorry to leave you like this, but I really have to get back to work. - Yeah. - I'm gonna go freshen up and head out, okay? Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah. I'll be fine. Hey, we're back. Uh, hey. What's going on? Samantha just gave me some really bad news. Oh no. What? It was, it was Erik. He's dead. My god. What happened? I don't know. Geeze. He must have been younger than me. That's crazy. I, I know you knew him better than I did. I'm, I'm sorry, sweetheart. Yeah, I think I'm just I'm, I'm, I'm kind of in shock. Scary stuff, huh buddy? Yeah. I'm gonna go to my room. Maybe we could go out to lunch or something to get your mind off of it. I think I just wanna stay home. I don't think I feel like going out. Sure. Okay. I'll make you some tea. That'd be nice. And in local news, police are continuing to investigate the death of Erik Curry, a contractor who was found dead in his Atlanta home yesterday. Initial reports suggest he may have been deceased for several hours whenneighbors discovered the body. Authorities await the results of an autopsy. But sources say it certainly looks like foul play. And while there are currently no suspects, it appear... Good afternoon, Ms. Davis. I'm Detective Collins, Atlanta Metro. This is my partner, Detective Schilling. Yes. Hi. May we come in? Of course, please. So, yesterday, I saw you outside of Erik Curry's home and I'm assuming that you know that he's deceased. Yes, it's awful. I, I've seen it all over the news. How well did you know him? Fairly well, he, he just did some, some work on our house recently. When was that? He just finished up just, just a few weeks ago. Okay. Were you all friendly? You could say that. Yeah, he was nice. Easy to talk to. Did you ever see him socially? I, I saw him around town every once in a while. Any other times? Yes. We met for drinks. When? Thursday night. Just drinks? Yes. Just drinks. - Where? - At the Rose Tavern. Did you go anywhere after that? No. I just came home. Are you sure? Of course. I'm sure. We have a ride share driver who says that he drove you from Erik's place to this address at approximately 11:00 p.m. on Thursday night. 11:02, according to the app. That's correct. So why did you just tell us that you went home? Because I did. I, I rode with Erik back to his place and then I got a ride share from there to my home. Why did you go to his house? I don't know. Just to hang out. Were you and Erik intimate? No. But you were friends? You could say that. Did your husband ever know anything about this? Do I know anything about what? Hello, Mr. Davis. I'm Detective Collins. Schilling. Go up to your room, Langston. Langston, go. What's going on? We were just asking your wife some questions about Erik Curry. Oh, I see. I'm sorry. How can we help? Why don't we continue this another time? Give me a call and we can arrange something. Homicide. Do you think he was murdered? It seems that way. Oh my god. Well, I can see you out. Of course. Thank you. Why did you lie to me? Please keep your voice down. Langston doesn't need to hear this. How long has this been going on? What do you mean? Were you sleeping with him? No. I'm not sure I believe you. Come on Peter, just calm down. - Okay? - No, no, no. You were sneaking around with him and you lied to me about it. What was I supposed to think? Yeah, right. Peter. Peter. Hey. I'm sorry I lied to you. It was really stupid of me. I just want the truth, Kendra. Okay. The truth is... Erik and I became friends while he was working on the house. He was funny and... And, and, and what? Tell me. Nice to me. Interested in what I had to say. It, it made me feel good. Feel good? Okay. I don't know. Ever since Langston's been getting older, I, I don't even know what to do with myself half the time. I feel kind of aimless. And there's this distance between us. So this is my fault? No, of course not. I'm trying to be honest with you. And if I'm totally honest, I was tempted. Tempted. But nothing happened. I swear, Peter. I wouldn't do that to you. Come on, Peter. What you got? You scared me. Do you know whose phone this is? I found it in the laundry. No, it's not mine. I know it's not yours, kid. Where's Dad. I don't know. Mom, What's going on? I want to know. It's complicated. Whatever. Okay. Can I help you? Oh, uh I was just looking. Guy was killed. You knew him? Erik, right? Yeah. Were, were you two close? I just knew him in passing. I'm sorry. I don't mean to bother anybody. Guess our time's up. You're the best, you know? Of course. Hey kiddo. Turkey sandwich? Thanks. Was uh, Samantha just here? Yeah. She stopped by to see you. You let her in? Yeah, just for a little bit. Then she left. Okay. Hey. Where'd you go? Just went for a drive. Did you see anybody? Nope. I just needed to think. Oh, I, I, I found a phone. You found a phone? I found a phone in the laundry, must've fallen outta somebody's pocket. I put it right here. Did you take it? No. Why would I take it? Langston. Langston, come down here. Langston! Alright. What? Did you take that phone that I found in the laundry? No. Why would I take it? That's exactly what I said, dude. Somebody took it. It wasn't me. Hey babe. I saw Peter with Heather today. He, he snuck out the house... Alright, slow down. Okay. I know. - I'm sorry. - I'll be outside. Um, one minute. Okay, now why would Peter sneak off to see Heather Nolan? That's what I was wondering. You didn't just ask him? No. I mean, he just found out that I was hanging out with Erik without telling him. - It just felt... - Hypocritical? To call him out for doing the same thing? - Exactly. - Yeah. Have you found out anything new about Erik? Yes. So it was definitely murder. Someone hit him over the head with a blunt object. Oh my god. Who, who could do that? That's the question. Have the detectives talked to you? Why would they talk to me? Well, you knew him pretty well. Yeah, but I wasn't with him the night before he got murdered. You mean like me? I didn't mean it like that, Kendra, come on. I guess they think I'm involved. They asked me to come down for an interview tomorrow. They're just gathering as much information as they can. Try not to worry so much. Yeah, easier said than done. By the way, I'm sorry I missed you. Missed me? Yeah. I saw you driving away from the house as I was pulling up. Oh, right. Well I just, I just wanted to talk. Look, I, I really gotta go. Okay, we can talk tomorrow. Yeah, sure. - Bye. - Bye. We believe Erik was killed by a blow to the head with one of his own wrenches. That's awful. He was very meticulous with his tools, but one of the wrenches is missing and all of his tools are marked with his initials: "B.C." Have you ever seen a wrench like that, Mrs. Davis? No. Why would I have? Maybe he used it when he was doing work on your house? Oh, I don't. I don't know. I, I don't remember. We already know about your date Thursday? No, it... not a date. Can you tell us where you were on Friday night? The night of the murder? Um, I, I took my son Langston over to his friend's house for a sleepover. What friend? Will Nolan. They've been friends since they were little. What time did you drop him off? Uh, 6:30, 7:00? It was still light out. And then? And, and then I went home. Peter was out with some clients and my friend Samantha came over around eight. What's Samantha's last name? Rogers. That's how I met Erik, actually. And what did you and Samantha do? We just watched TV and, and talked. For how long? She left around 10:00. And then? And then I went to bed. What time did your husband come home? Uh, I don't know. I, I don't know. I, I was asleep. So, you don't know for sure if he came home. He came home. I, I, I just, I woke up, then I fell right back asleep. It was late. Definitely after midnight. Why are you asking about Peter? Just gathering information, ma'am. Oh, sorry. It's my son's school. - Hello? - Ms. Davis, Langston's gotten into another fight. I see. Can you come to school and get him? Yes, I'll be right there. Thank you. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to pick him up. No problem. You've been very helpful. That reminds me. You wouldn't happen to know where Erik's cell phone is, would you? His cell phone? It's missing. Just like the wrench. Are you all right? Ms. Davis? Yeah. I'm, I'm fine. I just, I need to get to my son. You didn't answer my question. About? Any idea where Erik's cell phone might be? Um no, no, I, I don't know. I, I'm sorry. I really do need to go now. Come on, baby. Hey, are you okay, Will? Will get in the car. No, he's not okay. Langston attacked him. I'm so sorry. I'm sure there must have been some reason. What reason? Are you trying to blame Will? No, not, not at all. I, I didn't even get the full story yet. Langston hurt him. What else do you need to know? Boys fight sometimes. I'm sure Langston didn't mean to hurt him. Well, I'm glad that you're so sure about that. Well, Will can be a bit of a bully, sometimes. A bully? Excuse me. I'm sorry. That came out wrong. Heather. Heather. What? What were you and Peter doing together yesterday? What are you talking about? I saw you two at the park. He's your husband. Ask him. It's not that big of a deal. I hit Will. Yeah, I know that. And it is a big deal. Why'd you do it? He was making fun of me with his new friends. So I hit him. Why was he making fun of you? 'Cause he's a jerk. But I thought you guys were friends. No, we're not Mom. I told you that. Okay. You're right. Maybe I need to be a better listener, and realize that you're not a little kid anymore. But no more hitting anybody, okay? Violence isn't the answer. Is there uh, anything else you wanna tell me about? What do you mean? Like about Dad? What about him? I don't know. Is, is he acting a little strange at all lately? All of you've been acting strange. All of who? Adults. Parents. You and Dad. Will's mom. Heather? What do you mean? She snuck out that night I slept over. Snuck out? Snuck out of her own house. It was about 11:00. I heard her talking on the phone and it woke me up. I walked out on the balcony and I watched her leave. I mean how's that for strange? How did it go at the police station? I don't know. It was uh, uncomfortable. What'd they ask you? All kinds of things. By the way, I had to pick up Langton from school early today. Why? He got into a fight, with Will. Will? That's weird. I always thought they were so close. Gave him a black eye. I already talked to him about it, but I think you should too. Definitely. I'll go talk to him right now. Heather was really upset about it. Have you heard from her? No. Why would Heather reach out to me? I'll get it. - You expect anyone? - No. Alright. Can I help you? Hey buddy, your parents here? Yeah. You wanna come in? Is interrupting a family dinner standard protocol now? Sorry, sir. I'm sure you understand time is of the essence in our work. This won't take long. Langston, go to your room. Kendra's been more than accommodating. She went down to the station today, as you requested, answered all your questions. What more do you need to ask of her? Actually, we have a few questions for you, Mr. Davis. Such as? Maybe we should sit down. Okay. So what would you like to know? Where were you Friday night? I met with some clients that were in town. What kind of clients? I'm a corporate lawyer. What were your clients' names? Dwayne Sanders and Isaiah Carpenter. They work for Fulbright Industries and I've done a lot of business with them over the years. Where did you go? Joe's Back Nine Sports Bar. What time did you leave? After the last call, around 10:00. Did you go anywhere after that? Kendra told us you got home late. She wasn't sure of the exact time, but said it was past midnight. Look, Peter, full disclosure. We have door cam security footage from a private residence that shows your SUV driving on Fair Oaks Avenue at 10:22. Just two blocks away from Erik Curry's house. Erik's neighborhood wouldn't be on your way home from the Back Nine. In fact, it's on the other side of the freeway going in the opposite direction from your house. Oh. I went to go see him. You went to go see who? Erik. Tell us what happened. Please tell us everything. The whole story. I found out that Kendra had been sneaking around with him. You did? I followed you on Thursday night. Let's get back to Friday. After a couple of drinks at The Back Nine I decided to go see Erik. Why? To tell him to stay away from my wife. So you went to his house and then what happened? I knocked on the front door. He answered. You know why I'm here. - I guess. - Stay away from my wife. I had my say and left. I didn't even enter his house. - That's it? - That's it. I swear. Look, I understand how bad this must look, but you know, I would never hurt anyone. Peter, Peter would never do something like that. These things tend to spiral out of control. Maybe you lost your temper and, and there was an accident. What? No, no, that's not what happened. If I had killed him, I wouldn't be even talking to you right now. I'm not an idiot. I would get a lawyer and I sure as hell wouldn't admit going to his house. But you did admit it. 'Cause I'm trying to help you guys figure out what happened. So you would say you were at Erik's house, maybe what, 10 minutes or so? Not even, less than that. Okay. That's still a couple of hours unaccounted for. Where did you go when you left Erik Curry's house? I just, I, I just drove around. You just drove around? Yeah. Yeah. Listen, it's late. And I think I've answered enough of your questions for tonight. Okay. Thank you for your time. We'd like to continue this tomorrow, if you don't mind. Fine. I'll be here. Well, I hope you have a good evening. We'll see you at the station in the morning, Mr. Davis. And of course, you have the right to have an attorney present if you wish. By the way, you haven't seen a wrench with the initials "E.C." on it laying around anywhere, have you? No. What about a cell phone? We're still looking for Erik's. No. See you tomorrow. Where are you going? Upstairs. No, we need to talk about this. About what? Where did you go after Erik's? Yeah, I could tell you weren't telling the truth about that. I need you to be honest with me. Honesty? Right. Did you take the phone that I found in the laundry? Did I take it? I've never even seen it. Why didn't you mention it to the detectives? You know why. I... I can't stand the way you're looking at me right now. That's it. I'm getting out here. Peter! Peter. Langston, I'll be right back. It's gonna be all right. I don't know what to do. Cops are asking questions. - It's too much. - I know. I tried to explain that I was just driving around and then they start accusing me. Don't worry. I've got your back. Okay? Don't worry. What are you looking for? You really are scared of me. How do, how do you expect me to act? Hmm? You're hiding something. Why did you go to see Heather? You followed me? Yeah, I did. Just like you did to me. And that's not the first time you've gone to see her and lied to me about it. Like you lied to me about Erik? Look, I know I haven't been completely honest either. Whatever's happening, I just, I just need to know, please. You were right. About what? I wasn't completely upfront with the detectives. After I left Erik's house, I didn't just go drive around. I, I, I went to see Heather. And what did you and Heather do? Nothing, just talked in the car. Okay. So you could talk to her, but you couldn't talk to me. What's really going on between you two? Nothing. Come on. I saw you guys at the park. I, I saw the way she touched your shoulder. I saw the way she hugged you. Okay. Okay. We have gotten close. That is true. But we've never done anything physical, nothing like that. She's just a friend. When did it start? It didn't really start. We've known each other for years. I, I, I sometimes text her. She texts me back and I guess it just... It just what? It was a mistake. Alright? I'm sorry. I shoulda never let it go on like that. It will never happen again. I still love you, Kendra. And I just want things to go back the way they used to be. - Me too. - Okay. But I need you to be honest with me. Always. I need you to tell me what happened that night with Erik. Absolutely nothing! You think it was me. I could never hurt anyone, you know that. Yes. Fine. I, I do. But if it wasn't you, then... You know, there's something else I need to tell you. After I left Erik's house, I saw someone else arriving. It was dark. I was looking out the rear view mirror, and I can't be sure, but it... Uh, but I thought it was Samantha's car. I don't really know where to begin, but I need to ask you something really important. Okay. What is it? Did you happen to go by Erik's place after you left my house on Friday night? Erik's? No. Hmm, because Peter went over there around 10:30, to tell Erik to leave me alone. And he thinks that he saw you arrive when he was leaving. Well, it must have been someone else. Are you sure? Yeah. I'm sure. If you know anything, you need to tell me. The police are interviewing Peter tomorrow. They think he had something to do with Erik's death. I mean, can you blame them? I mean, you were basically having an emotional affair with Erik and that gives Peter motive. And if they know that he was at the scene of the crime, just before the murder, I mean, what do you expect them to think? You don't really believe all that, do you? I need you to tell me the truth. I am. Well, I can tell when you're lying. Well, believe what you wanna believe. What about the phone? - What phone? - Erik's phone. Okay. I give up. Kendra, what are you talking about? Okay, you were at my house the day we found out about Erik's death. - Okay. - Did you have Erik's phone? Did, did you maybe plant it in my laundry room? Why would I do that? To frame my husband. Yeah. You knew that he was at Erik's house that night. I told you I wasn't there. And I saw you leaving my place the other day. Langston said you came inside. Maybe you came back to get the phone? Oh, oh, oh, okay. Wait. Let, so let me get this straight. You're accusing me of planting a phone in your house. Now you're accusing me of stealing it back. Maybe you had second thoughts. Maybe there was something incriminating on the phone, like, like, like a text between you and Erik maybe. So that's why you came here? To accuse me of stealing this mysterious phone right now? Did you have a fight with Erik? Was there an accident? Hmm? A fatal accident. You have got to be kidding me. You think I had something to do with Erik's death? - Wow. - No. You know what? You need to leave. - Samantha. I, I'm just... - You need to leave now! Hey. Buckle up. How was school? It sucked. Do you wanna tell me about it? The teacher stepped out and Will called me a douche in front of the whole class. Well, I hope you ignored him. Well, it's hard to when everybody's laughing. Do you want me to talk to your teacher? No. No, she wouldn't listen. I'll make her listen. Just forget it. I don't care anymore. Hey. How'd it go with the police today? The lawyer said not to worry, but I don't know what to think. You hungry? No, I already ate, but thank you. I'm gonna try to get some work done because I'm behind on everything. Oh, and I told them that I thought I saw Samantha. They're probably already talking to her. I'm sorry. No, you did the right thing. No more secrets, right? - Mm. - Peter? Yeah. We're gonna get through this. Yeah. Hey. Well, thanks for ratting me out to the cops. I thought we were friends. What do you expect us to do? Peter's a murder suspect. All that matters right now is the truth. No, the only thing that's gonna come out of this is my husband finding out that I went to see another man late on a Friday night. I'm dealing with the same thing with Peter, but maybe this will be for the best. Maybe we can all try to be a little more honest with each other. Why were you at Erik's? Why do you think? You were sleeping with him. I had no idea something was going on between you two. You never said anything to me about it. It's because you only ever think of yourself. Samantha... Would you just listen to me? For once. The police came to see me. I kept my mouth shut, but I'm speaking with them tomorrow with my lawyer. And I wanted to give you a heads up for old time's sake because I'm telling them the truth about everything. Good. That's exactly what you should do. And I told you I have nothing else to hide. But maybe your husband does. What do you mean? Did Peter tell you what happened just before he saw me? Peter attacked Erik. He got out of the car and walked up to the front door. You know why I'm here. Erik came out and they got into an argument. I couldn't hear what they were saying. And then suddenly Peter swung at Erik, just punched him, right in the face. Oh my god. Maybe Peter is the one keeping secrets. The only reason I didn't say something before is because I didn't want anyone to know that I was with Erik that night. I spoke to him later and he told me Peter threatened to kill him. I didn't think your husband was capable of murder, but... maybe he is. Maybe he's the one who took Erik's phone to cover both your tracks. You and I may be done, but I am a loyal enough friend to tell you to watch your back. Okay? Peter? What are you doing? Why are you sneaking off in the middle of the night? I'll be back. Don't worry. Where are you going? Just trust me on this. Trust you on what? No more secrets. Remember? - Okay. - What's that? - What do you have? - Nothing! Ow! Kendra. Kendra. - Oh! - Hey! Kendra! Come here. No, no, no, no. Stop! Come here. You're making a mistake! Stay away from me. Kendra. - Langston, wake up! - Stop it. Where's your phone? We need to call the police. - No, please. - Let me in, Kendra. The police? Where is your phone? Stay back. Fine. Okay. I said stay back! You don't understand. I do understand. How could you do that? How could you kill him? I didn't. This is a murder weapon. Yes, Kendra. I know that. What? What is going on? Langston. Langston. I can't take it anymore. Baby, baby. - Stop! - Okay. It's okay. It's alright, son. - Hey. Hey. - Langston. - Hey, Langston! - Langston! Langston, stop! - Stay back. - Oh no, no, no. Stop. Stop. Stay back. Stop. No, no Langton please, no. Langston, put the knife down. Put it down. We can work through this. No, we can't, it's too late. No, no, it's not, son. It, it's okay. We'll, we'll give you your space. Okay? Just please, please don't press down on the knife like that, baby, baby please. We don't need to do anything rash, right? And we can just, we can just talk this through. Like we always do. We'll figure this out. No, we can't, not this time. That's not true. I'm not gonna let you do it. Give me the knife. I'm not gonna let you hurt yourself. There's no way. Okay? I love you too much. Okay? It's okay. Baby, it's okay. It's okay. Just drop the knife. Come on. Come on. Okay, okay. Okay, okay, okay buddy. It's alright. It's alright. It was me. I killed Erik. Okay. It's alright. Okay. Okay, okay, okay. It's alright, buddy. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. I knew you'd been talking to Erik for a while. How? I put spyware on your phone. Your phone, too. Why did you do that? At first it was just to see if I could do it. Like the cameras. The cameras? There's one up in that corner. It's tiny. It's really hard to see. But they're all over the house. I know it sounds weird, but I'm good with that kind of stuff. And I thought it'd be fun to spy on you guys. But I ended up learning all the secrets you've been keeping from each other. And with the spyware I could read your phone. All of your texts. It gave away everything. Mom, you'd been flirting with Erik. Dad, you were doing the same thing with Will's mom. I, I, I know it sounds stupid, but I just didn't want you guys to get a divorce. No, no, no, no, no, no. That doesn't sound stupid. I totally understand. I'm sorry, son. I'm really sorry. I know you went to see Erik on Thursday night. So when Will's mom snuck out to see Dad on Friday night, I sent Erik a text telling him to stay away from you. I kept checking my phone. I waited for him to answer me and he didn't. It made me really mad. Will was asleep and his mom was gone. So, I just had this crazy idea. I grabbed my coat, tried to be as quiet as I could, then I snuck out of the room and decided to go to Erik's house. But why? Why would you wanna do that? He ignored my text. So I wanted to go confront him in person. But I didn't realize that Dad had done the same exact thing earlier. I heard you tell it to the detectives. I watched the whole thing from the living room camera. So what happened after snuck out of Will's house? Will's house isn't that far away from Erik's. I hid whenever I saw a car. I wasn't planning on doing anything bad. I... I just, I just wanted to talk to him. I just wanted to make him answer me. Hey. What are you doing here? Hey, you're Kendra's kid, right? Um, Langston. Yeah. Did you get my text? No. What text? Stay away from my mom. What? Stay away from my mom. That's what I told him. That's all I was gonna tell him and then I was gonna leave. But... But, but what? But he laughed at me. Just like Will and his friends laugh at me. Stay away from my Mom! Man, you're strong. I'll give you that, but, I still don't know why... I, I didn't mean to kill him. I, I, I swear. I didn't, you guys, you have to believe me. We believe you. You believe me? Of course we do, Son. Of course. Am I gonna go to jail? No, you are not going to jail. We are going to get through this, together and nothing's going to happen to you. I promise. He's finally asleep. I saw that hidden in his room a couple days ago. A couple days ago. Why didn't you tell me? I've been trying to figure out what the hell to do. So you just wanna get rid of it? Of course! This could change his life, Kendra. Okay. What about Erik? He killed a man. Are we supposed to just sweep that under the rug? Why not? He said he didn't mean to do it. I believe him. Don't you? Of course. But... No, no, if anything Erik's blood is on our hands because of our secrets. Think about that. Our son was just trying to keep his family together. We've always known he had behavioral issues. Remember the playground fights? Those were just minor incidences. That's what we told ourselves. But now we have the time to get him the help that he needs. We get rid of the wrench and we put it somewhere that no one could ever find it. Okay? Just like I did with the phone. You destroyed the phone. Yes. This, this is a really serious decision we're making. Do you understand that? You think, I don't know that? I'm willing to do whatever it takes to protect Langston from our mistakes, Kendra. But if you're not, you need to tell me right now. Langston said he texted Erik. Okay. As soon as the police check the phone records, they're gonna know it was him. No, they won't. I used an app to send the text anonymously. They can't trace it. And without Erik's phone, they'll never even know what I said. Don't don't worry, Son. Don't worry. We've got this. Everything is going to be okay. Right? - Right. - Yeah. We've got this. You're gonna be all right. Watch out. Okay? - Come on, Langston. - Let's go. This way. Watch your step. Langston, let's go! - Whoa! - Whoa. Are you guys gonna be back for lunch? - Sure. - What do you think about BLTs? - Mmmm, BLTs. - Your favorite. How do BLTs sound? Awesome. Okay, good. Have fun. I love you. I love you too. Langston, I'm going long! Going long! Yeah, buddy! Alright. You still think they're hiding something, don't you? As a matter of fact, I do. Well, we got nothing. Unless somebody talks or a certain missing wrench or cell phone magically appears, it feels to me like we hit a dead end. Sooner or later, something will give. Secrets this big are hard to keep. Seems like a nice family. Isn't it always that way?
