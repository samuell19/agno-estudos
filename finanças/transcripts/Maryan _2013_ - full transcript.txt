Sudan, Africa. A strange country… Unfamiliar language… Unfamiliar people… Having been a fisherman all my life. it wasn't easy to learn a new job. I found a good friend, Saami. He reminded me of my best friend Sakkarai. Much to my dislike of this job. I was forced to work hard. What a curse! I took the fishes away from the ocean… now life has dumped me in this desert. Your fisherfolk life. What is so great about it? Pani. ls that all! It's misty in my town too. This is something else. You won't get it. One thing I enjoy hanging out with you is a drag from your cigar. It's my native specialty. Talking to Panimalar once a week was my only comfort. That made me very happy. And I slept well. Slowly I got used the place. and its people. After all we are human. Two years somehow went by. Now I am going back home. Going to see my Panimalar… Going to dive back into my ocean. - Maryan! - Pani. How are you? You? Now only I feel good. Just one more week to go, Maryan! My last two years have been the slowest. Looks like the coming days will be even slower. I feel this too. I'm coming Pani! Back to our ocean. back to our moments. and you in my arms. First thing, I want to have your delicious pepper rice. Sure. Did you get my last letter? And… also… Got your 53rd letter. And… got that too! Hey, don't send me anymore. rest in person. Thommai has announced to every person in the village about our wedding. The only thing left is to stitch your suit. Tell Thommai my size has changed in the last two years. Let's get it when I am back. I hope you are in a huggable size. I am running out of change. I need to get back to work. Shall I go? Shall I? Listen Maryan, come back safely! Ok, See you. - What is he saying? - He thinks this is Dubai. Hey! This is not Dubai! This is Africa! We have rubbed our ass for two years. He has just arrived. He will know as the days go by. Hey Baldie, Play some Tamil songs! Hey Chacha, Play Hindi songs! You guys copy Tamil movies in Hindi and make flops. Why do you want to listen to flop songs? Is there are heart branching out of the iron? Is love calling on me for the first time? I see you Tamils in Dharavi. I see you in Africa. You Tamils are all over. Shut up! You good for nothing! Tamils are everywhere! Sridevi is from Chennai. Hema Malini is from Chennai. Silk Smitha is from Chennai Our own A.R. Rahman is from Chennai So is Sachin Tendulkar. Sorry! Slip of my tongue. Maryan, isn't our Chennai a foreign city? A foreign city?! Life has gotten numb. Your life is set. you are getting married. You have been happily romancing your girl's photo for the past 2 years. I have four babes to choose from but not even one is getting hooked! But not even one is getting hooked! It has to come from the other side too. My name is Maryan. Maryan means The man who never dies' As my name suggests… I was of arrogance and full of pride. Instead of salty air. I got dust storm. Instead of fried fish. I got tasteless meal. All my arrogance got knocked off. There I was the king… King of the ocean. By catching the tiger shark Maryan has brought pride to Neerodi. What his late father could not. he has achieved. You are 'The King of the ocean' We don't rest Not a single day have we rested Our mother ocean has not stopped giving us We don't rest Not a single day have we rested Our mother ocean has not stopped giving us We don't rest Our fishing nets never returned empty And 'Sonapareeya' kills me with her smile Oh! Golden angel, Sonapareeya! My Sonapareeya! Will you come along with me? We don't rest Not a single day have we rested Our mother ocean has not stopped giving us We don't rest Our fishing nets never returned empty And 'Sonapareeya' kills me with her smile How long will I live single like a catamaran, Sonapareeya? All catamarans have reached their shores, when will you? There is no one like him, Sonapareeya This man's skills can never be matched! You stay rooted in my heart but why are you stuck like a fish bone? Why do you make me plead, Sonapareeya? Hey Maryan, looks like you have taken all the catch You have taken all the catch So what's your problem? Keep moving. He is the only guy who is yet to come under my control. Ships in your eyes. Hiccup in your heart Money in your hand. Tease in your walk. Pearl in the oyster. Ship full of fishes. The kisses of my sweetheart are all mine, all mine. It stuck… stuck. ah! ah! Mathi fish stuck! Hiccup in my heart. Given by my sweet heart. We don't rest Not a single day have we rested Our mother ocean has not stopped giving us We don't rest Our fishing nets never returned empty And Sonapareeya kills me with her smile! Bro, we had a great catch. Come on to the boat. Hey Maryan! You are the one in Neerodi who still continue the tradition of spear hunting He held his breath for this big catch. And we've been lazily lying on the boat I am hungry. Give me the food. Bro, Eat this. What he gives is just food. But this has love and care mixed in it. Maryan cannot be toppled by your tricks. He keeps chanting your name whenever he meets Panimalar. Now he comes here and blabbers about love and care. Look! Mariyan never stops doing what he likes. But never ever does what he dislikes. Like super star Sivaji with 'Smiling queen' She is the best pair for our Maryan - Shall I say something? - What are you going to say? What are you going to say? Fine, say it. When you don't seek. you don't get. But when you seek. you will definitely get it. I say a statement and you come with yours. - I will kick your butt. - I will kick you right there! It has never happened. It never will. I have promised her to bring him to the church. If not, she will finish me. If you interfere she will finish you too. If he comes to know this, he will kill you right away. - What's that? - Nothing, it's his usual blabbering. A confluence. This is a confluence of love. Happiness. Ours is a church of happiness. A confluence. This is a confluence of love. When your eyes open, you see the vision. When your heart opens, you become one In love we seek, in grace we drench In sharing we stand and in giving we make joy. Why do you keep pulling me to church? What is this sudden feeling for God? Want to wash away my sins. My only sin is being your friend! Where is Kuttiyandi? I asked you! Where is Kuttiyandi? He must be drunk and lying somewhere. Is it so? Only we can correct him. Sakkarai! See who has come to church? Ask him. I know you came to see me. Good imagination! He only pulled me in. Then why did you keep staring at me? What? I was staring at the girls around you. If you really had stared at them. I would've finished you then and there. Why hit him? You talk to me. When you don't seek, you don't get. But when you seek, you will definitely get it. Why don't you speak your mind? Don't play this hide and seek with me. Now go home like a good girl. Let me see how long you wear this mask. I have seen it in your eyes. Is it so? Come what may… you are mine. See you. Bro, looks like she will trap you! How could she do that? It can't happen. Nobody can trap you. You are Maryan! Looks like you are ready for toddy shop? Just like that… Even people going to work are not so punctual. Even if I want to go to work. Maryan says he will give me a share as rent for my boat. So… Seeli's son is the problem. Seeli says that I am the problem. You say the other way. He is a problem to all of us. What? Nothing. Who can match my Pani's tasty fish curry? It instantly kindles the taste buds! Enough of your sweet talk! Hi Panimalar, it’s been long! How are you doing? Are you coming from the church? In Neerodi you are the only one whom I speak to so sweetly. It's because I care for you. I am the one who keeps talking. You are so silent. Next time when I see you… you have to talk to me. Normally if you like a girl. you either take her for a lease or outsource her. But with Panimalar you become too soft. Those girls are for a night. but Panimalar is for my life. I want to touch her rightfully! That is why I am patient. Who needs your money? I have been telling you not to go for fishing. Your money is of no use. Work in a foreign county is waiting at the door step! But this idiot is tied to his sea! It's time to go abroad and earn some good money. Instead he is hanging out with these idiots! Look at his companions! Seeli! Why are you abusing us? Seeli! Can I have the aapam too? Here comes the next one. What are you guys doing? We are having some aapam. Do you want some? Will any human being eat this? Put it aside and come along! Hey! Eat some. Stuff it yourself. Listen Maryan. for so long she is asking you to go abroad. Why don't you consider it? At least we will feel proud that one of our people is earning a huge sum. Do you think for people like us they will give computer jobs? You will be ending as a laborer. We are all Kings of the ocean! Can't work shamelessly under some third person! My father died in this ocean. My life is also tied to this ocean. I don't think your running around Maryan is going to work out. Whatever might be a man's stature, the moment he feels the breath of a woman… All the fizz will fizzle out. I will tell you what to do. When a matchstick is inside a match box, does it ignite? The matchstick fires up only when it rubs itself with the matchbox! Who is this Joseph? How come I don't know him? He is new to our village. He owes me money. How come he owes you money? I can't believe it! - What are you doing behind? - Nothing. - Where is it? - The next street! I don't know which street to take him. Bro, Bro. The next street! - You said same thing over there? - Yes. I am saying the same thing. I won't say the same thing again. Where you imagining a hugging scene? Don't ever try this again. I will slit your throat. All your talk on match box and matchstick, had no fire… First, I need to set fire to your ass. - Sakkarai! - Yes bro, coming. What is he up to next? Bro, what's the matter? Bro, I want to say something… That is… Tell me bro! - Nothing… - Why is he so shy? Hey! My button! Now tell me! That has come to me! What has come? It has come to me… I fell for her… Bro! I knew it always! Chin up! I am feeling shy. - Bro! Can you do me a favor? - Go ahead! - I want to see… her… - What you want to see in her? Tell me. I want to see her. Is that all! I will bring her right now! Bro, not now. You know she makes great pepper rice? Ask her to bring it here in the night. See how much you love her! Hey Sister! It has worked out! Unlike any day my son has asked me to bring food? He is not to be seen. Let him come. I will leave it here. let him come and eat it. How come this bitch is here? Bro! Where has he gone.? He will come. Sit down. Now tell me how did he say it? Have you started all over again? This is the 50th time! Just one more time. You should've witnessed his shyness! I have never seen him like that! I myself got a kick out of it. Then? He has gone mad thinking of you all the time. Why isn't he still here? Wait, he should be coming from his home. Yes! It isn't easy because Seeli is there. She keeps vigil of her appam joint as if somebody will steal it. I feel like poking her eyes whenever I see her. She thinks her joint is on par with a star hotel. Only I know the aftereffects of her aapams. Just wait… It's all for the time being. After I enter her home, first thing I will do is close her aapam joint. Just for this reason, I want to see you both in marriage! Seeli will have no option than to run around me for food. You bitch… kick your ass! Knowing your plans, my son had called me here! Hey where are you running? If ever you come this side, I will break your neck. He will trick me and take me to the church. He will drag me from street to street to collect a debt that doesn't exist. He will think Panimalar like a movie star. Hey Hippo! Hope you will never do the stupid thing again! Bro, Can I ask you one thing? Why only one thing, ask me more. Am serious and you are being funny. Don't get upset my loving bro! For so long Panimalar has been so obsessed with you. why are you avoiding her? You have grown old but your brain hasn't developed Kuttyandi! Ever since my father went along with Thommai into the sea and died. Seeli has not stopped cursing his family. How will she accept Panimalar? Even if I bring her home. how will Panimalar be at peace? Let her lead a peaceful life! This ocean is my only life. If you guys want to hang out with me then don't get me into this again! Hey! Are you going to beat me up! What are you looking at? Shut up and go to sleep! The cyclone is expected to cross in the next 48 hours. Fishermen have been warned not to go into the sea. Your friends have gone to catch tiger shark in this storm. - Thommai! - He is not here. The weather is rough and the storm is coming. Maryan and his friends have gone deep into the sea. Inform Thommai. My love, where have you gone? The night has fallen My love, where have you gone? The night has fallen The congee is cold. Don't you feel my heart! If we are together If we are together The sky will rejoice If we are together This life will be a blessing This life will be a blessing This life will be a blessing My love, what will I do? This sickly hue has got in me. My love, where have you gone? They have returned safely from the storm. But the boat was broken. Now don't worry. Bro, what a shame! We have broken Thommai's boat. The whole village laughed at us. Bro… Are you so ashamed? Then don't come with me anymore. Maryan has no shame. I am not ashamed! Hey! You just went away! Do you know how I was dying? You went to kill yourself in the storm? Just go away! What do you think of yourself? Absolutely nothing! What? Love? It's empty ground. Get lost! I have seen you alive. You are all right. Go! Go away! Hey Maryan, do you have a light? - Do you have? - No. Do you have a match box? Here is the match box! You will never change. This ocean and love, No matter how many times you see them, they always remain fresh! Thommai, you seem to be in good mood! Hey, I am talking from experience! Experience? Then how come you are a bachelor? Love should keep flowing in your heart like a sea of waves! That is the real strength! For a man to be successful. he should be consumed by the scent of a woman. Who is that woman in your life? Look what the old man says… 'A man should be consumed by the scent of a woman'. Dear bride and groom, in the presence of this holy gathering… In the presence of this holy gathering… Hi Panimalar! Your friends are all getting married. You just say 'yes' I will setup for the next auspicious day. Don't you know whose bike it is? Get up! Get up! If you feel itchy, go and rub it on the palm tree! Why are you rubbing her slippers? If I repeat this aloud, the whole village will laugh at you! Listen, stop meddling with Ladies’ matter and behave yourself. So what if he rubs on Pani’s slippers? Why are you deceiving yourself? I know you love her. Do you want to get beaten up? Truth always hurts. Panimalar! Stop! Listen to me. Stop it! Leave me alone. Listen, I am busy with my choir, with my work in the church. That's all. It's clear that there is nothing over there. I only know how much he loves you! Why does he raise his hand over loved ones? Please understand! He has grown up like that! It's because he loves you he fought with Theekurusi for rubbing your slippers! What did you say? Go ask him yourself. I have seen you alive. You are all right! Why are you deceiving yourself? I know you love her. For a man to be successful. he should be consumed by the scent of a woman. Come what may… you are mine. Why so late? Look at the romance. Hey, Pani… What? See our hero's romantic look! A flower will bloom, when touched. I bloomed without a touch. Gold glistens when heated. My cheeks blushed without a sizzle. Without meeting the eyes Without touching the hands Can there be love? Be in person, lose yourself The desire will last forever. A flower will bloom, when touched. I bloomed without a touch. Hey! Thommai! Come out! Yes, my son is a hero. Don't ever imagine she can have him. If you have shame, self-respect… then come out! Can't you find any other man in this village? From now on if I see you trying to hound him. I will pull your hair om! Don't give me that look! What are you people looking at? This is between a mother-in-law and her daughter-in-law! I will cut your tongue! Who is your mother in law? Don't you know? It's you! Has it gone this far… If you step into my home as daughter-in-law. I will chop out that leg! Let us sort that after marriage! See how she talks! How dare! I know who is behind all this. Am I doing a strip-tease for you all! Go! Go! Let Maryan come! What are you doing here? If there is no lady in the house, see what a mess it is! Don't you wash your clothes? Are you nuts? If Seeli sees us she will rip us apart! Mr. Maryan… how come you are afraid of Seeli? She will make a big scene in the village… I don't know what to do. She has already done that. Our matter is announced! What do you want? Will you give me anything if I ask? It depends on what you ask. Am I going to ask for a child? You might ask… Leave now. Shall I leave? Shall I? You said empty ground? Now it's been occupied. Why not stay a little longer? Girl, why this hurry? Be with me. Why not stay a little longer? Girl, why this hurry? Be with me. And my heart hardly filled Don't leave me my love. don't leave me. Barely has our conversation begun. and my heart hardly filled. You come about like the waves while I stay rooted here like the sea! Why not stay a little longer? Girl, why this hurry? Be with me. You let my heart ramble all alone. And now without warning you cast your net and have me trapped. Come to me love, unfailingly as these waves. I will hold to your hands like a bangle. But show a little patience, the man of my dreams. Why wait, you are blossomed as you are. Why not wait a little longer? My love, why this hurry… tell me. - Bro, aren't you joining us? - Hey, get lost. Why will you need us anymore? I will wait for you forever. I swear by the sea goddess. My cheeks flush. And I'm hesitant to let you know. This salty breeze spreads sweetness. Pulling us both into its warm embrace. With the breeze luring us in, my soul is at peace. The fish-stench of my body turns fragrant by your touch. Talk to me all night and I will savor every word you speak Why not stay a little longer? Girl, why this hurry? Be with me. I want you to be my eyes And the father of my children. I want them to play by the edge of these waves. You shall be mine. May your wishes come true. Let's now create a world of our own. What happened? When will the Sinhalese stop this injustice of killing our poor fishermen? Oh! My Sakkarai! Oh! Someone has killed my son. He has always been with you! Maryan.. look at my son lying lifeless here. Someone from across has killed my son! Why did you go? Why did you without me? It's my mistake. Your mother is asking me. What will I tell her? To bring you back, what should I do? I don't know. Maryan! Theekurusi is coming home to ask me for marriage! Please come and stop it! Listen, I can't manage this on my own. Are you coming with me or not? Sakkarai is dead! He is lying there! Do you know who he is? Get lost! Get married to anyone you want! You keep sitting here! Get lost! I will marry him! Then I will hang myself. Then you can bury me over here. You can stay here forever. Thommai… if we are here at your home, it means you are blessed! My brother was neglecting marriage for a long time. now he is so firm like the catamaran, to get married to Panimalar! Thommai, you cannot keep sitting like this. It's been years since I lend you money. I didn't bother you at all. Now you compensate that money and give me Panimalar in marriage. How can debt be compensated with a girl? Out of respect for my sister, I accepted this formality. Otherwise I would've lifted her long back! You know… It was Sakkarai… so… You keep hitting me. Who else can I hit? Don't be angry. That day I should have killed you and thrown you into the sea! Having left you alive, are you playing a romantic scene here? Theekurusi, I don't have any one. Already I have lost my friend. Now I cannot give up Panimalar. Why do you waste time talking to him! Give him one. Please Son. Don't' create problem. Hey, give me the money or the girl! Maryan! Stop this! This is my family matter, you don't interfere I want the money with interest settled by morning… Otherwise you won't be alive. Thommai? He has given the deadline. I am worried what Thommai can do! Come in. It's a two-year contract. Your first year pay will be adjusted for this advance. You can see money only in the 2nd year. You can't leave halfway even if you dislike the job. Hope you are aware about Sudan? Sign the agreement. At least now you realized Seeli's words. Give this to Theekurusi. Don't think this is for you. This is for Pani. Take care of her. You are a son of this ocean. You grew up on her lap. How will you leave this place? It's just two years. I will be fine. This is what you wanted. Are you happy? I know why you are leaving! All these years when I shouted like a donkey you never bothered. But now you go all the way to save her dignity. I did not ask you to go because of money. Go, throw this on that bitch! You stayed happy, being in the sea, being with your friends. Now you are leaving everything because of me. It's not because of you. It is for you. Don't cry. Stop crying. Is this the way you will give me a send off? Two years will pass like a flash! I'll be back for my next breath. Maryan! I didn't have the courage to look back at her. Two years have gone by. I am going to see my Pani in real and not in this photo anymore. Hello Maryan! What is upsetting you? His girlfriend is waiting! He left her when he came here. Wife? You must have run away from her. He is married. He will miss all the fun. He said his measurements have changed. Hope it will fit him. Forget it, once he starts eating your food, he will be fit and fine. - Sister! - Come inside. I am here. There is a call from Africa. Don't know what the matter is. come fast! Maryan! I am William. I work with Maryan. Please tell me… Some workers from our company have been kidnapped by the local militia. We have no clue about their whereabouts. We fear Maryan may also be one among them. What are you saying? Please do not worry. The company is taking the necessary steps. Nothing will happen to him. Maryan, I am hungry. Give me some… I have destroyed my son's life! If I had known such a thing would happen… I wouldn't have sent him! Oh! God please help my son! Hey Seeli! Shut your mouth! Why are you creating a scene? All you people! Go home! Maryan will come. He will fight them all and come. You only gave birth to him. But you know nothing about him. You bitch! You are the reason for everything! Look how she is talking! Heard the news… Felt really bad. Forget the past. Maryan and I fought, but he is one of us. If something happens to him, we can't just leave it. Tell me what needs to be done. I am there for you. Does God exist? He has left and gone long ago. Yesterday she was there I was by her side. Hey Maryan, come to me. Yesterday she was there I was by her side. I was there. Hundred moons lit the sky A few blue doves fluttered and flew The air was filled with her sweet voice The sands blossomed like her flowery body. Yesterday she was there I was by her side. Hundred moons lit the sky A few blue doves fluttered and flew The air was filled with her honey-dipped voice The sands blossomed like her flowery body. Yesterday in my breath there was nothing but your love. Yesterday in my breath there was nothing but your love. Yesterday in my notes there was no word as sorrow. Yesterday my bangles sang to your music. Oh dear sky! bring back those yesterdays, today. Yesterday you where there I was by your side. You where there, we were together. Hundred moons lit the sky A few blue doves fluttered and flew The waves kept yearning for your return They longed and stopped by the shore. Yesterday she was there I was by her side. Hundred moons lit the sky A few blue doves fluttered and flew The air was filled with her sweet voice The sands blossomed like her flowery body. Listen, Sir. We trusted you and sent him. A man can only find a job can he stand guard all his life? Don't give me all this nonsense. You sent him, right? Tell me. Look lady! I sent him because his mother wished so. Ask his mother or ask the company I have nothing to do with this. This is not me. Maryan, how many days have gone? Will the company pay the money? If they don't, will they kill us? If he runs… he will die What an idiot! You cowards! What the hell do you want? Money? We don't have any. You are poor, so are we. Can't you see it? We only have our lives! Why don't you take it away! What? Come on… shoot! Come. They won't shoot us. They need money, The legs that never danced would dance to our tune The sea gulls would sing close to our ears. Come to the shores of Neerodi. Witness our boats sailing along. I am a tiger-shark hunter. I am the king of the ocean. I extract pearls from deadly depths. I rule the ocean, I am Maryan. The aroma of the nethili fish curry. Breezes through my village. The pristine toddy from a palm tree The salted dried fish And the drunken raptures As my spirit yearns for its roots I feel like an angered clown. As my spirit yearns for its roots I feel like an angered clown. I am a tiger-shark hunter. I am the king of the ocean. I extract pearls from deadly depths. I rule the ocean, I am Maryan. My heart-wrenching tunes Fall mutely on these barren rocks. My heart-wrenching tunes Fall mutely on these barren rocks. My trapped soul groans amidst these senseless goons. I crossed borders without you. Now I am crippled in this forsaken land. Hoping that the tree of our shared memories reaches you I cry out for you my love! I am a tiger-shark hunter. I am the king of the ocean. I am starving Maryan. I want to eat a full meal. Bro, why worry? I will give you. Pani! Give him a plate. Sit up my friend. A plate for Baban? Pani. Place it properly. Kanava thokku, Panna Varuval, Seela Poriyal, Kilaikkaan. All your dishes. Oh! Kilaikkaan fish is for adults! Take it away! Panimalar has cooked pepper rice. It's hot and spicy. Can you smell it? That's nethili fish! Hold the fish by its head. Open your mouth wide. Its tail should touch your palate, then slowly withdraw the head. the thorn slips gently out like a soft flower. Next, toddy. Bro is already on a high! Bro, do you want a cigar? This is my native cigar. Take a puff and burp. Hold it. Sir, I am A.O.C worker Maryan speaking. - Maryan! - Yes… This is Maryan. Maryan, where are you? These people are shooting sir! I can't understand what you are saying. Yes Pani. I am here. I am alive. But I do not know how long. What did you say? I can't understand what you say! - Pani. - Yes, tell me. I do not know whether I will ever see you again. Don't speak like that! I can't understand your situation. First tell me where you are? No sir… I do not know… - It's all over Pani. - Why do you say like that? Listen, don't wait for me. Maryan listen to me! Nothing will happen to you. Yes sir! You are my man. I will bear your children. I will be waiting for you. Maryan, do you hear me? Hey you kid! Kill me right away, otherwise… You will repent it later. I have told Pani. That is enough. Bro, what they have done to you? I was scared for you. How did you manage? - Let us get out! - Yes Maryan, Let's run. It's all over Pani. Listen, don't wait for me. Don't cry my love, don't cry… My affection might not bring him back. But your love will. Thommai! He is coming. Maryan is coming! He is coming! - Who said that? - I am saying! I have been informed. He will never come back! He is coming. He won't come. Only I will come. At this very spot I was insulted. Theekurusi is back. What will you do now? Laughing? You arrogant bitch! I should've had you long ago. You can't do a damn. You pig! Don't you know who I am? You think I am not capable? Motherfucker Theekurusi! I will kill you! Are you going to kill me? Show me how. Maryaaaaan… Thommai, Maryan is coming back. Saami! Even if a thousand suns burn out And all compassion wiped out Even if injustice rules the skies And humanity loses kindness. Even if pain holds life in its pangs Your love will live! Oh heart arise! Oh heart arise! Oh heart arise! Oh heart arise! Love never dies! Even if our worlds die and memories fade out of your heart Even if seasons change form And children cease to smile. Even if nature changes its course Your love will live! Oh heart arise! Oh heart arise! Oh heart arise! Oh heart arise! Love never dies! Fear not, weaken not. soon will misery end You will be born new. flowers adorning your path. Your love is the living truth Stay on! Let darkness not swallow you up Oh heart arise! Oh heart arise! Oh heart arise! Oh heart arise! Love never dies! You said you will be back in a breaths time? My life is your breath. Come back my love! I want to bear your children We have to watch them play by the sea. Come. Come to me. Even if a thousand suns burn out And all compassion wiped out Even if pain holds life in its pangs. Your love will live! Oh heart arise! Oh heart arise! Oh heart arise! Oh heart arise! Love never dies! Oh! Mother. Welcome to the ocean. My home. Maryan, are you feeling better? For 21 days I was held captive by the militia. I escaped and ran for about 300 Km without food and water. I lost my Sakkarai in the ocean. I lost Saami in the desert. But it is for my Panimalar. I am still alive. You said you will be back in a breaths time? From now on all my breath is yours.
