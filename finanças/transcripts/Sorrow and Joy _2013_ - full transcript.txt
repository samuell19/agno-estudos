SORROW AND JOY Here he is. Hello. Where is Signe? And Maria? Johannes, something terrible has happened. Signe... Signe... Signe has killed little Maria! She cut her neck with a kitchen knife! - What are you saying? Where is Signe? - I never want to see her again! What are you saying? I don't understand. Where is Signe? She called and said she'd killed Maria. We hurried over here, and she was by the phone and said Maria was upstairs. I ran up, and Maria was lying dead in Signe's bed. Get up, please. Get up now! I'll never set eyes on her again! Weren't you supposed to be here all afternoon? Yes, to help her sew the curtains. But she couldn't find the material. - It's in her room. On the chair. - We couldn't find it. I thought you wanted me to come every two hours. - And the swimming baths? - She didn't want to. - So you left? - Yes, that was the deal. Else... try and explain once again what happened? Signe called and said she'd killed Maria. Where is Signe now? We called for an ambulance, and the police came. They took Signe upstairs and asked her, if she had done it. Then the police drove her away, and the paramedics took Maria. Somebody took the bed linen and the mattress and washed off the blood. From the phone as well... So she's at the police station? Yes... And they asked us to tell you to go down there. - But where's Maria? - I don't know where she is. - Steen Wall?. Welcome. - Johannes Lidenius. - Can you explain why this happened? - Explain it? No, not at all. A compulsive idea... insanity. - And where were you? - Giving a lecture in Funen. At Ejby County College. Your wife was committed to Risskov mental hospital? She suffers from a depression, but... She's also very restless. She can't sleep. She hasn't slept for a week. - Why is that? - Because she feels restless. She was at home this afternoon - - and her mother was supposed to be there, too. Unfortunately she left. How is your relationship? It's good. She's a bit ambivalent towards me. - What does that mean? - Ambivalent? Yes. She loves me, and she hates me, but... But she loves our daughter more than anything else. How was your wife, when you left? She was in good spirits. She was feeding our daughter. Thanks. Your daughter is nine months old? Yes. - Are those photos of Maria? - Yes. Do you wish to see them? No. Where is Signe now? Is she here? No, she was taken to Risskov. But do not contact your wife, until we authorize it. - No? - We must check your statement first. Oh, it's you. It's late. How is Signe? Signe... Signe has killed little Maria. It's not true. That can't be true. She cut her in the neck with a kitchen knife. What's the matter? Is it Signe? Signe has killed little Maria. - I went to see Signe. - Good, Else. How is she? She's very much influenced by the drugs. Almost expressionless. She can't even cry. - I brought a letter from Signe. - Really? - I thought we couldn't be in touch. - No... But nobody said anything. The nurse saw it and all... She has a private room, but they watch her 24 hours. - Did you read it? - No. Signe said I could, but I haven't. "Dear Johannes." "This is very difficult for me. Maria is dead... but it should have been me." "I can't comprehend it. It must be a horrid dream." "We may as well see our relationship as terminated. There's nothing left." "You have most lovingly bullied everything around us - - and dominated beyond the bounds of propriety." "This was the only way I could disengage myself." "Dear Johannes. Little Maria is dead." "Our love nugget, as we called her." "And I miss her terribly." "A nightmare before my eyes." "Obsessive thoughts made real." "Extremely manic and depressive at the same time." "My love to Johannes has died. Etc., etc., etc." Is that what it says? "Etc., etc."? Yes. Nobody must read this. It's completely logical. Nothing psychotic about it. She did it to disengage herself. - But she doesn't mean it. - But that's the way one reads it. And somehow she does mean it. She'll be declared psychotic and will be sentenced to psychiatric detention. So she'll not be released until she's made a full recovery. And a judge will then decide whether she can be discharged. But I must be honest and say that the outlook is gloomy. I've seen two similar cases. The first was a women who killed her 6-year-old daughter with an axe. She was placed in psychiatric detention for two and a half years. Three months later she drowned herself in the North Sea. The other case was a woman who smothered her 6-month-old daughter with a pillow. She was also committed to psychiatric detention. Here she hanged herself in an electric cord. - That doesn't sound good. - I'm sorry. But you must be realistic. Of course. But there is an alternative to psych. detention, namely psych. care. In that case the hospital itself will decide when to discharge her. This opens for a quicker re-socialization. - Is it possible that Signe might get... -... psychiatric care? No. No, I doubt it very much. In the case of homicide she'll receive psych. detention. Under all circumstances her release will be far in the future. I presume you'd like to be alone? - Flemming Gregersen. Hello. - S?ren Nauer. - Hello. - I don't know if you know us... We both have children in Signe's class. We don't want to intrude on you - - but might we have a talk with you? Of course. Come in. You may hang your coats there. - Coffee? - Yes, please. Obviously we're all pained by what happened. So last night all parents in Signe's class got together. Also to agree on what to say to our children. - Of course. - Explain to them that Signe is ill... And that it will be a while before she gets back. But... The kids have always been very fond of Signe... And we parents always felt they were in the best of hands with Signe. So... We made a statement that each and every parent - - wants her back as our children's teacher. - And all the parents are behind this? - Yes... They all signed the petition. And you all know that she killed our child? Yes. And yet you'll leave your children in her care? Yes... She was ill. Yes. I have a bad conscience. We should've reported Signe sick a week ago. I could tell she felt terrible. Have a seat, please. She was not herself at all. She came to see me on Wednesday to re-schedule a choir. She came at 9 and then again at 11, asking for the same thing. She knows. She felt ashamed afterwards. - I had a visit by Gregersen... - And Nauer. They came here as well. It's a big thing they're doing. You realize that, don't you? - Yes. - And very unexpected. But also an enormous help, in order to get Signe back. And we'll do everything possible to support that. I'm very happy to hear that. Aren't you Signe's husband? Say hello from Lene, Majken and Johanne. - She's your teacher? - Yes. Lene, Majken and Johanne. Okay? - I'll remember. - Thanks. I have to be honest. It's totally unrealistic. It's very engaging that they want Signe back, but... It will make no difference. She'll get psych. detention. - Listen... - No, listen to me! And then it would take 2-3 years for the idea to be relevant. - And then it would be another class. - Tell me again... What decides whether she gets psych. detention or psych. care? First a forensic psychiatrist must write a statement. - So it depends on his evaluation? - Absolutely. Johannes... I understand why you care so much. But it's also a way of repressing the tragedy. Signe killed your child. What about talking to a therapist yourself? No. I have no need for that. This is totally hopeless. I talked to the psychiatrist, who will write the statement. I asked him about Signe's condition, and he said he didn't know. - He couldn't just X-ray Signe's head. - He couldn't X-ray her head? Right. I asked when she would be discharged, but he didn't know. I just had to be happy that she wasn't in prison. He's the man that will decide our fate! - What's his name? - Birkemose. Jan Birkemose. - Why is he so obnoxious? - He has decided it's all my fault. Because I didn't take proper care of her, when she was a baby. Hence she fears being abandoned and has a low frustration threshold. - Where did he get that? - The files. When she was admitted the first time, ten years ago. But it's true... I often left Signe to Vera, our maid. She learned to say 'Vera', before she said 'Mom'. - He also wants to talk to you. - Of course. - Johannes speaking. - Inspector Wall?. Hello. We've now finished our investigation, so you can see your wife as of now. - Thank you... - But you can't be with her on your own. The hospital has been informed about this. - That was all. Goodbye. - Bye. I'm Johannes Lidenius. I'm here to see Signe Lidenius. Come on in. - This way, please. - Thank you. There's a permanent watch with Signe, and she has to stay there. Yes, I've been told. I'm having my Blue now, right...? Signe, look who's coming. Johannes... Hello, Signe. - Here's a chair. - Thank you. Hello. I went to your school and talked to the headmaster. Some of your pupils asked me to say hello... Lene and Majken. My parents also send their greetings. And I had a visit by S?ren Nauer and Flemming Gregersen. All the parents want you back as teacher for their children. I don't want to be a teacher anymore. No... Too bad that Maria died. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. - It's only good you can cry for us all. - You may take a break. I'll stay... - When will Maria be buried? - On Saturday. A funeral service. Will she be cremated then? Yes, she will... What did you do with Maria's stuff? Nothing. Everything is still at home. They give me a lot of pills. Do you have a photo of Maria? Yes. You can keep it. Sleep, little one, resting like birds safely nesting mid whispering leaves and under the eaves like flowers asleep in the meadows There's nothing to fear God's angels are near to watch through the deepening shadows. The sign of the cross is the token the power of evil is broken... Let me be honest: The only possibility I see for Signe - - is to get psych. detention. You know what that entails, right? Yes, and by that you prevent Signe from resuming her work as a teacher. Yes. If that had been feasible. - You know that the parents want her back? - Yes. I'm aware of that. But several circumstances prevent that. Like the public sentiment of justice. We can't have a killer in the streets six months after having killed a child. It would outrage people's sense of justice. - Nobody talks about six months. - No, but the court can't prevent it. You've been frank, so I'll be the same. When you tell Signe's mother that you can't X-ray Signe's head - - and that she should be happy that Signe isn't in prison - - is that the opinion of the public sentiment or that of the psychiatrist? I must admit that this was an unfortunate answer. I very much regret that. Or apologize for that. But it's my experience that it will take a very long time - - and that Signe won't recover in a near future from the tragedy. - But she was psychotic at the time? - Absolutely. It was an obsessive act. I agree on that. Signe is manic-depressive. And she got that from her father, who is also depressive. - And his brother committed suicide. - Yes. This is stated in the files from her first admission. They also state that the two of you met in a bar two years ago. And that she pretended not to know you. - Is that in there as well? - Yes. She told it to Dr. Ebba Larsen. - And your question is? - I'd like to know what you can add. Right. I'm a teacher like my parents. Quite imaginative, right? Quite. I teach the youngest classes music and Danish. And French to a 9th grade. - And what do you do? - Feature films. - Anything I could've seen? - Maybe. - I made one called 'Boys in the Dark'. - I saw that! - Little boys bump their butts. - Exactly. Playing shunting engines. Right. The children were good. - The adults weren't quite as good. - Well... Film directors don't need criticism. They need to be praised. The adults were good as well. But the children were better. I hadn't had a girlfriend for a long time. I'm not very outgoing. I'd rather have it as a gift. And Signe was a gift. Signe, I'll be going now. Do you want a ride? - No thanks, I'll be alright. - Okay. I'll be off. Bye. Good riddance. Was it important to date a pretty girl? I don't know. I may be particular. What do you mean? That you prove to succumb to aesthetic norms. I think my mother imagined me with more of an intellectual heavyweight. Signe isn't stupid, but she finds it hard to extract a point. - Have you heard about Shosha? - No, who's Shosha? One of the first times Signe visited me, she 'happened' to bring a novel. I asked what it was about. - Shosha? - Well, it's about a young writer. A Jewish writer from Poland, who meets his childhood sweetheart, Shosha - - and they marry, although he could have escaped to the US. - He chooses to stay in Poland? - Because of Shosha. Why? - She's not very pretty. - Why does he stay then? Is she special, or is it just a sentimental story? She's his sweetheart. From his childhood. So when he meets Shosha, she's still like a 12-year-old? There's no explanation, but it's mental and physical? He's grown, but she hasn't? So he marries a child? Have you read it? Why do you ask me then? - I had forgotten. - No, no... That's not why. You're testing me. You wanted to check whether I understand the novel. I would have taken offence as well. She felt she was being evaluated. Yes. But the real culture shock came when I saw her flat. It was my granny's flat. She died six months ago, and I got the flat. My mother helped put up new wallpaper and paint the walls and stuff. - What did you say? - Sawdust wallpaper. Yes, I think it's cool. And I bought a new coffee table and some chairs. - And the crochet lamp? - My mom made it. And the ones at home. - Cosy, don't you think? - Yes. Very. I'm just a bit surprised. Why is that? You give an impression of being very sophisticated. Smart clothes and all. But you live like our parents. - How? - The tile-top table, for example. - What's wrong with that? - Nothing! It's just surprising. - Did you get the lamp as well? - Yes... What's wrong with it? Then I said the wrong thing: that it reminded me of 'War of the Worlds'. What about her parents? When you first met them? A friend advised me to add olive oil to the rice to make it more loose. I don't really think it works. - Do help yourselves. - Thanks. - What's that? - Mock-turtle. - Tinned? - Yes. I'm no good at cooking. You know that... Would you pour the wine, please? It looks good. The rice didn't come out well. The oil was a bad idea. I think it's something else. Is it long-grained or pudding rice? - Aren't they the same? - Pudding rice is for puddings. - I think you used pudding rice. - Really? Maybe... The packet is blue. Pudding rice then. It's okay. Go ahead and laugh. Have your fun. - Why do we have so many crochet lamps? - Because I made them myself. Is that wrong as well. It's so obvious! You sneer at my parents' bourgeois taste - - and my mom's horrible food and my sawdust wallpaper. - Embarrassing wallpaper... - Listen, please. I condemn nobody. I may know about furniture - - but you know other things. You play the piano like your dad. - Nonsense. You're full of disdain. - You speak French. I don't. I only know 'bonjour' and 'avec moi'. I was so proud of my flat. All my friends like it. But they were hypocrites! And laughed at my horrible furniture. You ruined the joy I felt. I was so proud of my flat! - Signe, you do have a cosy flat. - You're just saying that to comfort me. And my mom's stupid tinned food! Well, if the road to your son-in-law's heart goes through his stomach - - I'd had run off screaming. I felt sorry for my mom. And her mock-turtle. - Hi. - Hi... I'm leaving my flat. You ruined my pleasure in it. So I thought I could move in with you? Might as well... Come on in, and let's talk about it. I can get my own room, right? Otherwise I can't sleep. Why did you put up with it? I didn't feel I was putting up with anything. I just found her very, very sweet. Well, you could say I was in love. - And she was what I needed. - Sexually? That, too, of course. But she gave me... She gave me a confidence I didn't have before. She says the earth opens under her whenever you laugh at her ignorance. I try to react with humour. - And lecture her. - Yes. Isn't that allowed? What did she say about her past? She told me about her high school and the teachers, who fell in love with her. - Would you please put that knife away? - But of course. He was my history teacher. At the final school dance I wore a yellow dress. I was so hot! No, there's no photo... But his wife was pregnant, and when we danced - - I flung my arms around his neck, and he said, "Signe don't do that!" - "My wife is watching." - He was right. - What did the pregnant wife say? - I don't know. I had somebody as well. S?ren. He was jealous all the time... Oh no, you can't see this! What is it I can't see? - Oh no. - Yes. I'd just come back from France. I'd gained 10 pounds as an au pair. - Here you're skinny. - That was before I left. - I soon lost weight again. - Why an au pair? I wanted to study French... I also wanted to study Russian. - But then I became a teacher. - For how long did you do Russian? One term. "Zjizn trudna... No notj prekrasna." Life is difficult... but the night is wonderful. What did she tell you of her dark sides? Hey, stop...! Why do you keep hiding your hand behind your back? Where did that come from? It's from ten years ago. When I studied Russian. I had an affair with the Russian lecturer, while I was dating S?ren. Oh me, oh my. It was full speed ahead. I thought I could everything. I danced a Cossack dance in his office. Stark naked. Then I saw my doctor and asked for a gynaecological examination. I was very silly and kept laughing. He asked what was wrong, and I said I just wanted the examination. Then he asked if I smoked dope, and I said I didn't. Then he suggested an admission to Risskov - - which I thought was a good idea - - until I realized it was the locked ward, and that I couldn't leave it. - You went straight to a locked ward? - Yes. I cried and cried... Some of the other girls talked about slicing one's wrists. On a day out I got myself some razor blades and cut my wrist. - But not very deep cuts... - How did you feel afterwards? I was relieved. It was an obsession that made me do it. - And now I'd done it. - How did your parents react? They were terribly upset. My father's brother took his own life. It sounds as a manic-depressive psychosis. Yes, but I don't like diagnoses. I haven't been ill since then. I take some pills every day. I was afraid you'd leave, if you saw my scars. If we don't get a child together, I won't have any. That's sweet, but also quite a burden on my shoulders. But if you don't want children, I'm not having any. - What's that? - Lithium pills. I take three a day. Why? You're well. You have me. You haven't been ill for ten years. - That wasn't very clever. - No. But I didn't know at the time. But her mother was delighted. It was like a curse being lifted. She never wanted to understand. She prefers to repress it all. Lithium helps Signe against her mania and her depression. I soon realized that. But at the beginning all was well. I attended a spring concert at her school. Her choir wasn't sophisticated, but the children adored her. She was incredibly sweet towards them. And now it's you, Sofie. Come... Sofie will sing a solo. Are you ready, Sofie? Good. Roselil and her mother they sat 'cross the board Roselil and her mother they sat 'cross the board They said so many a jesting word... - Hi. - Hi. Cut... Cut! Stop the music. Thank you. Let's move on. I want the camera here. Villy's p.o.v. You all keep dancing. Helge and Iben are kissing. Then we pan over to Niels Ole, who jealously watches Helge and Iben. Right...? Good. - Let's roll. - How does one kiss? How you kiss? The way you would normally do. - I never kissed anybody. - Come on! - I never kissed. - I never kissed anybody either. - Should I teach you how to kiss? - Please. Signe, come here. This is a demonstration. Stand like this, tilt your head a bit. Otherwise the noses will clash. Then you purse your lips and... Show us, Helge and Iben. And you never kissed before? You know what? I can see myself in Iben. I was like her at that age. And I was just as good-looking. She's a gem, you know. She moves effortlessly between the scenes. Where did you find her? Elise Smith's School. Yes, she's great. - Will she be on the set today as well? - Yes. - Where? - At the school. All day. I'm not off till three. "Dear Johannes. Sometimes it's all about daring." "When I stood close to you and heard your cumbersome words - - I wanted to touch your gentleness. Later I wanted to tell you all." "Sometimes it's all about daring. At the risk of being misunderstood." "Dorte." - Who is Dorte? - I have no idea. There's no sender. - Where did you see her? - I can't tell, as I don't know her. - Is it one of the girls? - No, it's the handwriting of an adult. And a child couldn't write a poem like this. "PS: If you already have a girlfriend, could this be our secret?" Unbelievable! What a letter to receive. 42, 5, take 3. Ready! And go! And cut! Thank you, that was fine. But Iben, what are you chewing? - Nothing. - I can see you are. Let me see... Liquorice? Not when we're shooting. Your teeth get black. It's not liquorice. It's a lozenge. The lozenge is liquorice, and it can be seen. What's wrong with that? It only makes the scene better. We weren't allowed to, when I went to school, okay? - And you never broke the rules? - No, but okay... Let's turn the lighting! Okay? Signe? Signe? - What's up? What happened? - Who is Dorte? The one who wrote the letter? I don't know any Dorte. - I've been thinking about it all day. - That's stupid! - Be happy that people like me. - And you're proud of it! No, it makes me smile. What else can I do? - Johannes! - But it's a love letter. No, somebody wants to be nice, and that's it. - Why can't you tell anybody then? - I don't know... I'm needed in there. Signe, it's totally harmless, okay? I'm going back home. I don't want to be a bother. - Johannes, they want you now. - I'll be right back. I'll be with you as soon as I'm done here, okay? I've gone back to my own place I've been crying for 4 hours. All floodgates have been opened. - Signe, it's unfair... - I came home, and everything is yours. Your furniture, your lamps, your pictures, and where was I? It's all about you. And the stupid letter on the table... I can't help it, if I get a letter. I don't want to be there, or here! With that stupid tile-top table. It's because I finally found somebody I like, right? I haven't cried so much since I was admitted. Now I'm back in the ditch. What...? I'm sorry. Back in the ditch? Yes. Couldn't we... have the War of the Worlds at your place? Or my piano? Is there room for that? - It's a gift from my grandmother. - Of course. I just don't know where. But you know what? Let's buy you a grand piano. I have my furniture, you have your music. A grand piano in the living room would be fine. And why don't we get married one of these days? - Then I won't be jealous of Iben. - Iben?! Stop it. She's 15! It's only too obvious. Did she have a point? What can I say? Yes and no. We all liked Iben. The whole team was crazy about her. She was the only child that played up to us. She often came to the office in the evening. - What are you doing? - Having a whisky, relaxing, planning. - This is my brother. We're out biking. - A whisky for you? - No whisky for kids! - They'll like it. - Okay. - Iben! Give me a French kiss. Like the one Helge got. In your dreams. - What are you doing? - Loading the camera. In the bag. - It looks naughty. - I feel very naughty. - Why are you getting married? - Why we're getting married? Because we like each other. Two adults in love. And don't forget that a director must flirt with his protagonist. If you can't feel anything for her, you can't expect an audience to do it. - But Iben wasn't your protagonist. - No... Not yet. Congratulations! - What about your classes? - So neat you are. - A velvet tux and all. Congratulations. - Thank you. - Congratulations. - Thanks. Johannes Lidenius, we're here in Cannes, opposite the Carlton Hotel. - Congratulations on the fine reception. - Thank you. I'd like to talk about your plans for a new film. Is that true? Yes, I have plans, but I haven't written the script yet. It's about a father and his daughter. The girl is 16-17 years old - - and on her way into life, and her father is sick with jealousy - - and humiliates himself in order to hold her back. - It sounds like... - No, it's not a film about incest. There is an erotic tension in a broader sense. All your films deal with yourself. Is that the case here? - In a way. - But you don't have a daughter. - Where do you find inspiration? - Well, you transpose feelings... And I look around at my girlfriends and their fathers. - How they make a fool of themselves. - Thanks. We're looking forward to it. I know who will be casted, and what the film will be about. We just got married. Isn't that enough? I thought you'd take a break. You never talked about a new film. I just got the idea for it. Who will be in it? Iben? She'll be the daughter, of course. I haven't made up my mind yet. I don't know if the school will let her. You fell for me because you liked my film-making. - You can't expect me to stop. - I thought you'd have a break. Signe, it's hard to make you laugh from Cannes. Signe has been well for ten years, and then she meets you - - and your narcissist world. And pulls the chain on her Lithium pills. That wasn't very clever, I know. But she couldn't take the pills, if she wanted to get pregnant. - Did you want the pregnancy as well? - We were married. I've often tried to cheat myself... consciously. I might not want a child right now, but I knew I'd love it. Was marrying also a way of cheating yourself? What do you want me to admit? - Nothing at all. - Iben was very charming. But no... She was 15 at the time. - But it was distracting, of course. - And Signe sensed that? There's a black ring. I think I'm pregnant. I'm pregnant... I'm pregnant! Finally she could do something I couldn't. I've never seen her so happy. She had so much energy. And it lasted for how long? The extra energy? More than half a year. Also when we started shooting my new film. Iben? Come here. Listen... First take off your blouse, then walk up to the cupboard. You open it... and you think for a moment. Then go to the boiler room and put on a clean blouse. Then put on your coat and walk past the camera. You are annoyed with your dad. He focuses on you constantly. But you also tease him. You have a right to provoke him... Okay? - Yes. - Good... Let's get ready! Ready! - Sound! - Sound running. - 309, take 1. - Mark it! And... action! No, I can't... It's not what we agreed on. Cut! Thank you. It's in the script. As I explained to you. - That's not how I understood it. - Look here. "Mette takes off her blouse and walks bare-breasted to the cupboard." Can't I wear a bra then? It's natural. I'd do that myself. Then her father has no reason to react, and there's no story then. - That's not how I understood it. - But it has to be like that. Iben, if you're annoyed, then turn it on your daddy. That's the story. Okay, get ready. Ready! - Sound. - Sound running. 309, take 2. Mark it. And action! If you're not going to see J?rgen Hvitfeldt, where are you going then? Daddy, I'm 16, and I'm not accountable for where I'm going. I only asked out of interest. - You ask in such an annoying way. - Well, sorry! But your photographer friend has an unusually dreary disposition. - I see. - You could be more modest, you know. And not run around stark naked. It's not so easy when you stand there glaring. Cut! But they are not pornographic pictures. No? What are they then? What's this? It's not pornography. Seriously. Is it art? Is this 'finding the truth'? Good God! - Mette is not a minor. - Maybe not in the legal sense. But as a guest in our home you must respect that Mette is a minor! I think we should move straight on. No overlapping. Okay, let's try it. Excuse me for intruding. You're Johannes, right? - Yes, and you're Tiger. - You may call me that. Nice editing room you've got here. Nice and secluded. - Is she your protagonist? - That's right. Cute. Are you soft on her? You have to be, otherwise there's no eroticism present. I won't disturb you for long, but do you have a minute? Of course. What do you want? We're colleagues, as you know. I make films as well. I've made a script, where Jesus has a sex life. You probably heard of it. - It's hard not to. - It's gone to court now. It's crazy. For the case I need two appraisers. This is where I need you. I'd like to ask if you'd do me a friendly turn - - and be one of the two appraisers? And what does that entail? You read my script and the NT and assess whether - - my script is an independent work of art. And if I think it isn't? You're not that stupid. No, but... why me? - You're are a bourgeoisie favourite. - Am I? - I did make a film about anal fixation. - Two little boys bumping their arses. No old aunties will object to that. I can't afford to pay you, but you may have this painting. Maybe it's a portrait of Jesus. But what the hell. If you turn it like this, you see a healthy hard-on. Your choice. It was funny, but rather unfortunate that I became part of it. Maria was born in May. It was a very idyllic summer. - There's lemonade in the garden. - Thank you. - There's lemonade. Help yourself. - Thanks. - What's she drinking? - Camomile tea. It's good when it's so hot. There now... Camomile tea for you. She's so sweet. She's ever so sweet! I'm so happy... Signe, don't you think you should take your Lithium again? Wouldn't that be a good idea? Shouldn't we get another child, now that we're at it? Wouldn't it be good for Maria to get a baby brother? Or sister? Yes. - Where did you get to? - Mette just had sex with J?rgen. That far? May I look? Is it good? Yes, come closer. Rewind, please. Here. I don't think sex has ever been so good before. You're so lovely, Mette. I didn't do it for this, but I just won myself a case of beer. You're not cross, are you, Mette? I'm really crazy about you. We'll share it, of course. How embarrassing! "We'll share it." Oh, my...! - A story from Signe's youth. - I can almost guess. - Today he's a school-master. - They are often the worst. - We may go to the Berlin Festival. - Oh? When is that? February. It always is. - Who will go? - The director and the two lead parts. - If they select the film. - I see. - Would you like to see more? - Yes, please. I have to go now. - More coffee? - No thanks. Signe took care of Maria during the day. I had her during the night. Signe really needed her sleep. - You didn't help her during the day? - Yes, but Signe was on maternity leave. - And Signe was fond of Maria? - She was the joy of her life. And of mine. Although my world diminished after the opening of my new film. But then I had this script about Jesus and his sex life. What are you writing? I'm working on Tiger's manuscript. - Is it funny? - Have you heard me laughing? Why are you helping such a peacock. You owe him nothing. - He never took an interest in you. - He gave me a painting! And a horrible one at that! Don't hang it in here. It's a shitty script. I'm fed up with it. A shitty case to promote. Then don't. You could look more after Maria instead. It's a matter of principle. I can't get around it. Will Iben go to Berlin as well? That's the idea. Permitting her school. For how long will you be there? The invitation is for three days. Who else is going? Nobody else. Johannes? I can't sleep. I keep turning over. Say something soothing. - Can I have a sleeping pill? - Yes. There's a glass in the cupboard. I know what that film is about. 'A dad in love with his daughter'! No, it's about your own fascination. And so what? It's called sublimation. - But not in that way! - Everybody can see it. Signe, if I was crazy about Iben, why did I marry you? Why did I have a child with you? In Berlin. In the same hotel. I guess so. Can't you see how much it haunts me? I think of it all the time. Let me tell you what your problem is. It's nemesis. You are so bloody scared that Iben will do what you would do in her place. That's what you think. Is it? You were pretty cynical at her age. Flirting with your teacher - - in front of his pregnant wife. And the Russian lecturer? Didn't he have a wife? - She was really stupid. - And then it's okay? Right... But I was ill at the time. You know that. I can't sleep. I have five lessons tomorrow, and I can't sleep. - What do I do? - Can't you take a sleeping pill? I did. It doesn't work. - Will you please not go to Berlin? - No, Signe, that's impossible. The film is in competition. I have to be present. Can't you give up Tiger's script then? No. I can't. And I won't. My dad reads the Bible, and Tiger scorns him... Who says Jesus didn't have sex, just because it's not in the Bible? - So he must blow St John? - You don't give a damn about Jesus! But my dad does! It's my dad he sneers at! - And you're certain your dad was hurt? - Yes! It's so easy to deface others. I wouldn't think less of Jesus, if he were gay. - He wasn't! - You don't know that! Do you? The church always feared sexuality. The bourgeoisie distorted the Scriptures. He criticizes the bourgeoisie, not the Bible! Stop it! Stop it...! I can't sleep. Can't you help me? I can't settle down. It went on for a whole week. She only slept for half an hour every night. And yet she went about her job. When she came home, she would cry for hours. Thursday night I went to see a friend for legal advice on the Tiger case. Signe was on her own with Maria, which caused me some concern. Signe? Signe? Are you asleep? My neck hurts. Can you harm it by strangling yourself with a scarf? - You tried to strangle yourself? - Yes. While you were gone. With a scarf. Signe, this won't do. You have to admit yourself. I don't know what to do anymore. - So our happiness is broken now? - Not at all. We can handle this. It's a bad moment to arrive. I'm sorry about that. It's quite turbulent at the ward right now. It's a bit up and down, but we'll take good care of Signe. - Hello. - Hi. - Has Signe been admitted? - Yes. I'm not sure it was the right thing. But I agreed with Ebba Larsen that I'll pick her up tomorrow. She can be here during the daytime in weekends. And go back in the evening. And today? They want to keep her to get an impression of her. Do you want your daddy now? - Are you tired? - Yes. I don't get to sleep much. Else, I have to give a lecture tomorrow in Funen. I'll be back in the evening, but you have to stay here during the day. - Signe can't be on her own. - No. Why did Signe slash her wrists? - You mean ten years ago? - Yes. She was a teenager. Foolish. Some other foolish girls in the ward coaxed her into doing it. Saturday morning I picked up Signe at the hospital. She still hadn't slept. And it had been more than a week. She was totally dazed. When she came home she took a shower, and Maria had her baby bouncer. Else came, and she'd been at a party the night before and was exhausted. Did she really have to stay there all the time, she asked. Suddenly I felt very despondent. But we agreed that she must come by every second hour. Then she left. Then I changed my mind and called her. She was to come when I left. She would help Signe with the curtains - - and look after Maria, while Signe went swimming. And help prepare dinner, until I came back. Then I took off. But when I came back, and there were no lights in the kitchen window... ... I knew it had all gone terribly wrong. The only thing I didn't know was the combination of it. Would it be Signe? Maria? Or both of them? And this isn't a post-event rationalization? No. On my way to the car, when I was going to Funen - - I saw the axe in the chopping block in front of the kitchen window. I took it and dumped it in the carport, so it wouldn't cry out for attention. On Friday, when Signe was admitted... I'd taken Maria into my bedroom - - and that night I woke up at a deafening crash. Maria! Hush, hush... If Maria had been killed when I dropped her - - what guilt would I be carrying? What I do in my sleep is no different from what Signe does in a psychosis. No. Did you ever find out what the noise was? Yes, a couple of days later... It was snow sliding off the roof. Don't get up, please. I had a good talk with Birkemose. - What did you tell him? - We just talked about what happened. - Your pupils sent you a drawing? - Yes. I miss Maria. So do I. Signe... Tomorrow morning I'll be going to Berlin. I'll be gone for four days. Yes. How do you feel? I feel terrible. It's a weird condition for watching films. Everything becomes terribly symbolic. Scissors or a table knife make my heart ache. Let's not talk about that. What's going on tomorrow? - There's a press conference at 11. - Will I be going? Yes. That's why you're here. Will I have to answer questions? - If they ask you any. - In German? If you can. Or else in English. It's probably better in English. Most journalists speak English. - Not a lot in such a bottle. - No. Whose side are you on? The father's or J?rgen's? Neither side. They're fools, both of them. If I were to side with anybody, it would be Mette. You know what I find beautiful? The music. When the father is watching J?rgen's photos. What's it like to see your breasts in wide-screen? I don't really like it. Just be proud of your beautiful breasts. Should I feel guilty? No. You shouldn't. You can't help you're the person you are. I'm taking two sleeping pills now, and you go to your own room. That's what I intended. - Good night. - Good night. - Hi, Signe. - Hi. I just talked to Ebba Larsen. As of now we can speak... in privacy. - What should we talk about? - You could tell me what you do. I'm making a drawing. They suggested I make a drawing. - Although I can't draw. - What is it? A pram in our garden. And some flowers. You may say you can't draw, but this is the finest drawing I've ever seen. You really think so? - You may keep it, if you like. - I'd love to. Where are the other patients? They're watching a movie in the lecture theatre. I didn't want to go. I've written a letter to Tiger, explaining that I can't help him. - Because of our tragedy. - How did he react? He said it was a bad excuse for not helping him out. I'm glad you did so. I should never have left her alone. But I thought it was best to leave her alone with her child. You should have told me to stay. - What's wrong? - He believes he's to blame. The family curse. Laurits was the one who found William, when he had taken his own life. It's nerve-racking having to wait for the trial. Why can't we see the end of it? Is it Birkemose dawdling? You carry no guilt. We may, because we didn't look after you. Would you write that on a piece of paper that I can take out and look at? Yes. And you must know that we all love you. And would like to help you recover. I can't cry. Could you help me cry, please? - Can't you cry when thinking of Maria? - I think of her all the time. The little sounds she made in her sleep. I used to put my head down to hear her breathing. It hurts so much. - It hurts so much, but I can't cry. - That's because of your medication. At least you can sleep. The best moment is when you say goodnight. The worst moment is when I wake up, thinking it's all a bad dream. And then it isn't. But I don't understand why you can't talk to Ebba Larsen as well? Because she's your doctor. She's the one who can cure you. I can't. It's important you can be frank with her without thinking of me. I told her I want a divorce. And that I want a new job. The divorce thing is not true. Hello. I've also got a stroller, a pram and a playpen in my car. Sounds good. This is lovely! Thank you! We really appreciate it. Won't you tell me what happened? No. When my mother had left I walked around with Maria on my arm. I could find no rest. I remember being upstairs at a time. And then I was in the kitchen. I didn't want to do Maria any harm. But I happened to touch her neck with a kitchen knife. And it started bleeding... And I remembered thinking... Johannes will be angry now. And I had to keep doing it... How could I? She was the best thing in my life. I miss her. I miss her so terribly. I keep seeing her sweet little face. Keep crying. It's good for you to cry. On the left side of the neck, 3 cm below the bone process behind the ear - - is a 5 cm long and a few mm deep, clear-cut transverse lesion. Half a cm below there is a 10 cm long and 4 cm deep, clear-cut lesion - - cutting through musculature on the left side of the neck - - and of the carotid artery. According to consultant Ebba Larsen the defendant has been - - very co-operative and shown considerable progress. And during the past months she has shown no psychotic traits. Add to this that all good forces back her up - - and the parents at her school want her back for their children. The school and the school authorities support this. I shall therefore urgently recommend that the defendant as a maximum - - is sentenced to psychiatric care - - which is in accordance with the forensic psychiatrist. Thank you. The court is in recess, and I shall return with my verdict. - Hi. - I didn't like to hear the report. But it's good that Birkemose changed his mind. - Is smoking allowed here? - I don't know. Actually I don't think so. - How is Laurits doing? - Better. At least he's talking again. But it's hard. He can't make himself visit Signe. A sentence will now be pronounced - - in case SS 534-4/ 1984. The judgement of the court is: Signe Lidenius is today, Aug. 15, 1984, found guilty in violation of - - the criminal code, section 237, and is henceforth sentenced to treatment - - in a mental institution or under supervision hereof. An explanatory statement can be found in the written pronouncement. The court stands adjourned. What does that mean? This was the best we could wish for. - The best we could wish for. - Really? Yes. It's good... It's good! 26 years later - Was I asleep? - Yes. - For how long? - Five minutes. I must have needed it. - I think I'll go perform my ablutions. - Wait a second. Stay... You're so beautiful. You are so very beautiful. Remember Shosha? Who couldn't grow up? You must suffer from what she had - - for you look exactly like the first time I set eyes on you. Well, the curtains are drawn. - Will you keep my seat for me? - Sure. - Would you like a Coke? - Yes, please. - What time is it? - Hang on... Five fifteen. You came to see me every evening for 18 months. Why didn't you leave me? Because I love you. And if I had my doubts, I stopped having them. And I got my reward. I got a wife who never ever feels aggrieved. Even though you read me a long time ago. Now I start crying... You never got the children you dreamed of. Well, it's sad, of course... But I think I was the one, who was a curse on you. Do you remember I said that if I didn't have children with you - - I didn't want any at all. Yes. But we would have been good parents. And we would have loved teasing one another. I didn't mean to... You know that. Maria was the most precious thing in my life. Listen... This is funny. The other day in the garden I heard a sheep bleating. I don't know where it came from, but it was a sheep. - Maria should have heard that. - Yes, Maria should have heard that. Why don't you make films anymore? - Because I made my last film. - You say that every time. You need to make the film about reaching adulthood. I can't make that film. You know that. You made films about being hopelessly in love in intermediate school. And about hopeless love in high school. And a film about starting to make films and being hopelessly in love. It's not completed until you make the film about learning to love. I can't make that film. You know what? You saved my life. Although I know it will hurt, and that I'll never ever see that film - - my gift to you is that you must make it to complete your work. There's something I never asked you. Did Maria cry...? She screamed. I cannot make that film. Can't you make it without that happening? Yes. Yes, I can... Where's Signe? Didn't you pick her up? Yes, she's taking a shower. We went to a dinner party last night, and I have hardly slept. Do I really have to be here all the time? No, okay, but... Could you come and check on her every two hours? - Yes, let's say that. - And I'm leaving at 12.45. Right. - Was that Else? - Yes. She'll come over now and then. Have you seen Mommy? She looks like a bedouin. Isn't she funny? Little Maria... Let me take her. Hello, Johannes speaking. Else... It simply won't work. Can't you come here, when I leave? And help Signe with the curtains. And she has to go swimming to get physically tired. You must help her cook dinner, and then I'll be back. I'll be here no later than 6.30. Good. That's a deal then. Yes... Bye. I tried to walk Maria's way to school. That won't be for another five years. I'm aware of that. But it's still good to know. We'll pull through, right? Of course we will. Signe, I have to leave now. The roads may be icy. Else will be here shortly. Right. - Bye, Signe. I'm off. - Okay. - Bye. - Safe journey. The film is based on real events.
