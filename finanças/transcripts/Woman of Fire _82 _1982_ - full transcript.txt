We're getting an autopsy on the body. It doesn't look like a burglary, it looks like someone went crazy. So the wife survived because she was in the chicken coop? The chickens are kept awake so they will lay even-sized eggs. So you're saying she didn't hear anything? We're looking into that. It's a pretty gruesome crime. The owner and housekeeper were stabbed to death and covered in blood. The police are conducting interrogations but... This is where the body was lying. These days burglary murders are committed by twenty-somethings. Everyday the television shows at least 12 images of murder, it's no wonder is it? Murders are usually committed out of fear. 20-year olds have a lot of fear. This burglar probably did too. Don't move! I know you're scared but so am I. If you move, I'll kill you! That's quite a performance! You should change professions. But why are all the lamp shades broken? It would have made a lot of noise... A unique crime is easy to solve. At any rate, it's bizarre. The wife was caught because of the broken glass? The dead housekeeper left her will with a friend. But she'll give us the will on one condition. that the two are buried together. The wife will never agree to that. We know the wife committed the crime so let's agree to her condition. We need to get more evidence. It's easy to find the weaknesses of famous people. He met the wrong girl and ended up in trouble. Like, if he doesn't lend her money she'll kill herself? Her friends want to give her a funeral so why don't you give us her remains? Can't I leave? When can I leave? Is it the housekeeper's friend that wants it? Before the housekeeper died she left a will with her friend. What kind of will? I haven't seen it yet. You know the odds are against you? Why don't you believe it's a burglary? It wasn't the burglar who broke the lamp, was it? So you're saying the broken lamps are suspicious? It's his fifth conviction? He was a petty thief but when he was in prison, people looked down on him and now it's burglary murder. As the leader I wanted to make them work so I thought I would teach them a lesson. The will says the owner raped her and then tried to kill her because he was afraid he would get caught. They were both killed with poison. Is that what the autopsy said? It looks like the crime was a fake. The wife killed them because of their affair. What? It was only after my wife died that I realized how much she sacrificed. Because she was a mother she was a teacher and a doctor, a judge and later even a minister. From that day forward I couldn't believe a mother could be anything bad. Can you tell me about the housekeeper who worked for you? The Woman of Fire 82 Camera: Jung Il-sung Music: Han Sang-ki Editing: Hyun Dong-chun Kim Ji-mi Na Yeong-hui Jun Mu-song Kim Hae-suk, Yuh Jae-ha Production : Jung Do-hwan Screenplay and Director : Kim Ki-yeong Do you walk to the market or go by car? Walk. It's ok if you have strong legs. - Mom, they're back. - How much are groceries a day? 2,000 won, because we have a lot of eggs and chicken at home. We saw the paper in a remote village and ran away. We don't have anywhere to go. Let's go. They're trying to get us for cheap. This place sucks. - Without this job you'll end up in a brothel. - You're right. You're very wealthy. Did you make money raising chickens? If you live in this kind of house, you can learn a lot. Do you have a registration card? I'll hold on to this. You know, you can't trust people these days? I can't pay you a lot. I don't need to get paid. Just promise that after you're done with me, you'll find me a husband. Oh my. How many years later? Not when I'm a grandmother. But you can't say no to the person I choose. Ok? He can't be handicapped. You need to write a letter to my mother that you will be responsible for me. My mother is so worried I'll become corrupt she can't sleep at night. Mom, mom. Chang-sun called her a stray dog because she smells. What! You come here! What's wrong with you! You're extra noisy when there are guests. So what are you going to do, young lady? My mom said, if you go to Seoul the only thing you can do is work in a gentleman's bar. You should be willing to do anything if a guest offers money. or even your eye. She's asking for too much. Myeong-ja is the one that's greedy, she wants to marry a city boy. When I make money, I'm going marry someone in my hometown. Here. I don't know anything, I'm innocent... Honey, this is the new housekeeper. Hello. She's from the country and doesn't know anything. How old are you? 18. You're still a baby. Stop. What's that sound. She's pinching me. You're a genius. Listen to the new song. The only thing I know is how to raise chickens. Let me sing it for you. I don't know anything, I'm innocent but you planted the fire of love... You burnt the fish. You should take some cola up to the second floor. You need to shut the refrigerator door properly. It uses a lot of energy. Also, shut the faucet tightly. Ok. Wash the dishes with detergent. I don't know where to start. That's disgusting! Throw it out! It's a female. Nobody cares. Throw it out! Gross! Throw it out! What if you get blood on the floor? Here's some rat poison. You should use it from now on. In the country, when somebody catches a rat we give prize money. Why is the fish so burnt, mom? Oh, she'll get better. The stew is too spicy I can't eat it. Honey, these days people eat with their housekeepers. That way, they work just as hard as if they were family. Do we have to eat with the smelly stray dog, mom? You're a terrible boy. Myeong-ja, come here and eat with us. You're family now so you should eat with us. Uh, if you want to get married in Seoul you need to learn how to eat properly. You can't make noises. You stole money! Money? It stopped. Good job, dad! How about a beer? Let's celebrate our new family member. You have to have a drink too. Here. This isn't alcohol. In the country, we make sweet rice drinks with cold rice. Just one bowl can get a bull so drunk he'll fall down. Really? I don't believe you. I'll make it for you right now. Just eat and stop playing into his hands. Oh you! What's that? Rat poison. If you eat this, you'll die. You'll probably eat it. No, if you keep calling her a stray dog she's going to feed it to you. I'm not eating it. Eat it! No, I'm not eating it! Eat it! No, I'm not eating it! - Eat it! - Oh, you! You're hitting me again! It's because you're making me mad! Honey, you've gone overboard. Making her wash three times because she smells like chicken feces. Isn't that looking down on my profession? I like that you're loyal. It's useless, you're still going to stray. The new housekeeper, treats Hye-ok like the enemy. I told her to. I don't know how you acted around her but she's being very bold. My job isn't easy. Take that last incident for example. It's a misunderstanding. That girl died of a disease. She didn't commit suicide because she was in love with you. It's been tough for both of us. Restraint, loyalty, hard work, that's what has gotten us this far. Honey. The more successful we are it scares me. Nothing is for sure these days, but unhappiness always follows happiness. Stop talking like that, it's unlucky. Let's go to sleep. Happiness is sleeping. Hey, be quiet, you've been whistling all day. This one is broken. Their feed probably wasn't distributed equally. For chickens to lay eggs properly, they need to be kept awake until one a.m. then woken up at four a.m. Here, have one. It's good to have one a day. I'm going to have another one. When I get married I'm going to raise chickens just like you. If you want large eggs you need to give them feed made from animals. Animals? Yes, meat. Frogs, snakes, anchovies, silkworm larva, stuff like that. What about rats? Oh, you, you want to give them rats fed with poison? You're going to kill off all my chickens. Then I'll have to beat the rats to death. Watch your hands. If you get sucked in, you'll become chicken feed. Oh, my hand! What's wrong? Myeong-ja! I got you, didn't I? You're going to give me a heart attack. Look! That's gross! There are so many dead rats. Gosh! - Hey. - What's wrong? Our house is full of scaredy-cats. If someone were to break in, she's the only one that would put up a fight. What is that? Stained glass, it's very popular these days. Housewives take lessons to make up for their lost dreams. It seems like you like to dream. I gave up my dreams. My husband wanted to be an artist and be surrounded by young women so I decided to smarten up. By raising chickens and selling eggs I was able to buy this house. You worked so hard. I'll find you a good husband that doesn't make you suffer. A good husband is someone that will help you achieve your dreams. Dream? This is stained glass. I paid for Myeong-ja's classes in advance. Yes, you paid. This is very difficult. I have big dreams but... Starting is half the battle. Once you finish it, I'll buy it and hang it in the house. What's this? My dream was to be a dancer. I was famous in the country for being a good dancer. I used all my money yesterday to fulfill my dream. Look over there. Are you kidding me? You can't make rice cakes with cold rice. Be quiet. Myeong-ja's a good cook so she's going to find a good husband. It looks like this house has a loyal servant. But did you know that in recent burglaries, the housekeepers have died? It stinks. Why does she have to wear so much perfume? It really does taste like rice cake. I don't like it because it was made with cold rice. I don't like the stray dog. You can't call her that. Yes I can. She follows mom everywhere she goes, that's why she's a stray dog. I see you're eating rice cake. Let's see, Myeong-ja, let's try the sweet rice drink. This is for your husband. It doesn't taste like anything. Just wait. Even the best songs need publicity to shine. You're a genius. I knew it the minute I saw you. Even a genius needs money. Would you like some sweet rice drinks? Having her around gives me peace of mind. It's not very good. Let me try. Why does it taste like this? Let's go over it one more time. Ok. I don't know anything. I'm innocent, but you planted the fire of love. I learned about pain. We had a burning love but when it was too much to bear I left. I couldn't stand the growing desire I became a woman of fire. Don't throw the bottle away. Each of us should bury it in the sand and after it rains, the one that's filled with fish is going to have good luck. Let's go. Come here. Come here. - Ok. - Here. While I'm away at my parents, make sure to put the chickens to sleep and wake them at the right time so they lay uniform eggs. Then humans will have uniform kids if they sleep at the correct time, right? Are you already thinking of having kids? You're going out so I'm sure Hye-ok will be very excited. If she tries to sleep here, drag her out by her hair if you have to. If she isn't wearing any clothes, throw her out naked. You don't trust your husband? You're often betrayed by the people you trust and people who look innocent, often aren't. Here, try this. You can eat as much chicken and eggs as you want here. Thank you so much. Don't worry about Hye-ok, she's not going to be a problem. You're right. One, two, three... - Dad! - Hey. Dad! We're leaving. You don't have to come out, it's just going to be a week. - Ok! - Say bye to your dad. - Bye dad. - Ok. Mrs. Ju, you're leaving this genius home alone? Can I have your permission to take care of him? Don't worry, I've asked Myeong-ja to take care of him. Have a good trip. What? If you want to be successful, you need find a person's weakness. Successful? And I have to die first before I can kill someone else. Just don't kill me. I don't know anything. I'm innocent, but you planted the fire of love. I learned about pain. He's lonely right? I'm so tired, I don't even have time for a bath. You've got a pretty face. Girls should make themselves up in order to change their destiny. I'll turn you into a beautiful girl. Here... Take it, here. Take it. Have you seen my wallet? I don't have any money. Do you want me to lend you some? I don't need any. If you're going to give me money, give me everything you have. That's funny. I'm not joking. Actually, I decided to meet Mr. Shin in a hotel and accept his five million won to give to you. You're going to sell your body for money? If I give you my body isn't that the same thing? This is getting strange. I decided I'm going to use my body so I can give everything I have to music and you are going to feel responsible so you will compose good songs for me. Are you trying to play on my weakness? I'm not going to fall for it. I see. If I give my body to Mr. Shin then I'll never be able to see you again or come here. What should I do? Why did my wife have to go to her parent's today. She needs to be home. Your wife told me to give this to you. Get out of here! Please drink it. That alcohol is strong. Do you think she'll tell your wife? Should we go to a hotel? Now that he's had a drink he won't be able to go. Hey, get out of here! Get out! Lock the door and leave! Go! Oh, no. A man who can't have one affair in life has nothing to brag about. A man of prestige who doesn't cheat, is either cheap or a weak coward. I'm not a loser! You're so amazing! Are you trying to get him killed? Stay out of it! Who cares what he does! If his wife heard you, she would kill you! Who do you think you are! You're just a housekeeper. I may be a housekeeper but I don't steal husbands, you tramp! Let go! If you keep this up you'll wind up dead. Please open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Please open the door! I love you! Please open the door! Let's just go to a hotel. - Hye-ok. - Please, open the door! - I've decided to take you up on your offer. - Please open the door. - You're a genius, I'm a genius. - Please! We're the ideal couple. I love you! Hye-ok, nobody is better than us. - I'm the housekeeper, Myeong-ja! - I... Please don't do this! - I won't be able to get married! - You can get married. We're going to become one! Stop! You shouldn't be doing this to me or Hye-ok! Are you playing games with me? If you've made up your mind, you should act on it. Who are you? I'm not going to be able to get married now. It was a mistake, a mistake! Please! Write my mother a letter and tell her I've found a man to serve. Please? Please? I'll give you my life. Please, don't throw me away! I'm getting a cramp in my foot! What are you doing? You're working hard to make up for your mistake. What are you doing? It's a red sock. It's a mark to show that you're my husband. Honey. When did you get back? Uh. Yesterday I got in trouble. Get out. I said get out. That day I got a cramp in my foot, I thought I was going to die. That's a bad disease. You're right, when I do something bad that's what happens. It was one mistake, it's never going to happen again. Aren't women's bodies all the same? I'm thankful to God. Oh my god. It would be terrible if I got another cramp. Who said you could wear my wife's clothes! Take it off! Take it off for me. I'm starting to dislike men more and more and liking women more and more. What am I going to do? - Dad! - You guys are back. - Did you have a good trip? - Yes. I don't see Hye-ok. She hasn't come since the day you left. She must have met someone. Honey, what's with the sock. I put it on by mistake. Myeong-ja! Look at this ginseng. It was cheap. What are you using it for? If you boil it with chicken it will give you energy for days. So, were you able to stop Hye-ok? I kicked her out! She treated me like I was nothing. If she ever comes back I'm going to kill her. Why are you crying? I lose out because I'm always conceding. Do people think if you're an idiot if you're generous? People shouldn't exploit a person's good will. That's why you should live in moderation. What does it mean to live in moderation? Stop trying to pick a fight. Have some chicken soup. Chicken soup? I'm not sick. I know, she bought some ginseng to give us more energy. Let me have a taste. Honey just have some, it's good for men. I don't need any. I must be stronger than other women. In what way? My body feels great after being away from you for a week. That's a sign of health. Thanks for understanding. Are you trying to pick a fight? Honey, I want you to think of me as Myeong-ja. As a young girl. When I was her age, all men looked like dogs. I was so scared they would come after me. Myeong-ja probably feels the same way. She's so innocent. Myeong-ja comes from humble beginnings, she even hiccups when she sees food. Oh dear. - Come here. - Ok. Have a seat. Two beef cutlets. Ok, no problem. Bringing me here is too generous. I go crazy when I see the stained glass in here. I wanted to tell you not to leave me messages. It's because I can't see you at home. Seeing you sleeping with your wife yesterday made me want to die. Why did you turn me into a woman and make me wait all night for you? You have no shame. Honey. Are you crazy? Honey, I'm not sure. Aren't you ashamed? Please stop calling me honey. Honey... you're being mean. Honey? Stop calling me that. Where did you pick that up? That's what you and your wife say to each other. I'm just a concubine so you have to treat me as such. What if I called you darling? Stop it! Don't be mad. I'm not supposed to say no to the husband your wife chose for me. I need to take a picture of you to show my mom my future husband. When my mom sees your picture she's going to cry because my future husband is so old. People like our restaurant. People who come together always end up in love. Enjoy your meal. Can't you sit still? But this is what your wife does. It's too salty! Honey. I'm so happy we're here alone. Let's rent a room and live together. You're stuck now and my life is ruined too. You're late. I went to see a friend. Your husband isn't here. You're so family-oriented. It's no use. No matter what people say, a husband is the best. Aren't kids the best? My legs are always cramped these days. It's because you're tired. You need to exercise your legs. Exercise my legs? What is she doing? Well... Egg production is really low. I'm going to lose money if they don't lay more than one egg. I'm going to have to kill those chickens. You need to find out which ones aren't laying eggs. If you touch their breast and it doesn't feel full, or if it's oily you've found the problem ones. Those are the ones we have to find. Hey, what's wrong with you? You have indigestion. If you were married and were nauseous your husband would be throwing you a party. Honey. I made a big mistake. I threw up in front of your wife and she said if I was married, I would be thrown a party for being pregnant. I bet it's a girl. All concubines have daughters. They say that because they receive so much affection they give birth to daughters. What are you going to do? Two children are going to be born in one house. You're going to be busy. Our clients pay ten million won for a virgin, if they have a baby, double the price. Double the price? That's nothing. If the wife finds out, you'll lose even more than that. What do you mean. To a woman, a cheating man is like getting stabbed in the chest. You'll die. She'll murder you. Murder? - Hi. - Hi. Let's go over there. You want to borrow ten million won? That's a huge amount of money. I won't give it to you if it's to pay off a debt. If it's for business that's a different story. Stop. Stop. You've been drinking. You promised that no matter what you would have faith in me and save me right? Yes. Don't you know my body, my life belongs to you? What if I robbed someone? Yes. What if I murdered someone? Of course. What if I cheated on you and had a baby? Anything but that. Didn't you promise to save me? It would have been better to hear you were dead. I... because I believed in you I was happy despite all the suffering I went through. Now that I've lost you, how am I supposed to go on? You have killed me. My heart. You put a knife through my heart. I'm nothing but a corpse. I'm asking you for advice, I'm not asking you to find fault with me. I've never cheated before, that's why I made this mistake. Other wives pretend they don't know anything to help their husbands be successful. You need to acknowledge your flaws. Have you ever been a woman to me? What haven't I done for you? I'm talking about your body. If I let this go, are you going to get rid of the baby? You're not listening to me. This is going to hurt your career as a singer. It's not Hye-ok. Myeong-ja did everything she could to keep us apart. Then who is it? I'm so ashamed. Who? I was drunk and made a mistake. I thought it was Hye-ok! It's not Myeong-ja, is it? I promised to find her a good husband, in return she worked so hard for free. Her working here is what ruined me. I can't believe you slept with the housekeeper! Our blood is mixed together now? How could you sleep with me with that filthy body? I can smell the filth on my body. Honey, I'll take care of everything. I just need ten million won. I'd rather you died. For ten million won I would have to sell the house, and we would have to move into a rental. Please, I'm begging. Let's sell the house. Grow up. Please start acting your age. I think there might be a way. Marrying me off was easy. You found me a great husband and now I'm pregnant. I want it to be a girl. I want her to study to become a songwriter. It would be even better if she were just like her father. I'm going to the hospital tomorrow. You should go and get a check-up too. If you get pregnant in an impure way, you could have an abnormal pregnancy or a breech birth. There are a lot of disabled children these days, you know? Disabled children? I fought so hard for you. Your husband was so drunk, I thought he would die so I defiled my body. I need to see a doctor, I'm pregnant. But please you take care of her first. Here's a consent form from the father. Are you trying to starve me? You haven't given me so much as a glass of water in four days. Honey. Did you really starve her? How cute. Babies come into this world relying on their parents, right? You killed my baby and you let yours live. Don't say such crazy things. I'm not crazy, I was taken advantage of. I was pregnant with your husband's baby. You took away that baby. You mutilated me. Does that make you happy? All children are the same. If you killed my baby, now your baby should die too! This time it's my turn to kill it! What? Myeong-ja! Myeong-ja! No... No... Please, my baby. Please give me the baby. Give it to me Myeong-ja! My baby, give it to me. Honey! For the sake of our family, let's pretend this never happened! Let's do whatever she wants. If she wants money, let's give it to her. If she wants clothes, let's give it to her. I want your husband. After all, I need to get pregnant again. What? I can't believe this. You startled me. I'm going to quit tomorrow. Why, what's wrong? At this rate, I'm not going to be able to get married. Leave it in my hands. I promised to find Myeong-ja a husband too. I'm going to have an egg. You haven't eaten in days. You need to live. Yes, I do. I need to ask your husband to give me another baby. Is it ok for the stray dog to change this? Mom likes it. Hey, it's not hung properly. She's going to get mad at you. You're going to get in trouble. You kids! It's because you made it with broken glass. Who told you to touch it? Why is she lurking? Don't you think she's a bit crazy these days? I'm thirsty! Give me some water! Hey! Don't drink it! It's probably got rat poison in it! No, there's nothing to worry about. Give it to me. See? I would be worried if I were you. The water? You fed me rat poison! Mom! I ate rat poison! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! What's going on? Oh no! Chang-sun! - Oh no. - Oh no. Honey! Chang-sun is... - What happened? - Chang-sun. She put rat poison in the water. No, she lied and said I put rat poison in the water. This is just plain water. Look. Chang-sun. Look. No! No! Dad! I didn't! I didn't! You killed him. You came to this house to ruin us! Let's go to the police. You need to face the executioner for this. Let me go! I'll go to the police myself. Let's ask them who's in the wrong here. Fine. Honey. If this gets out we won't be able to live here. We won't be able to face our neighbors. Just let it go. Just cover it all up. No! Let's go to the police and see who's right and who's wrong. This entire family has ganged up on me to ruin my life. Myeong-ja. I'm begging, let's both just live in peace. Chang-sun... What... I'm too scared to sleep alone. Come to my room. Are you going to come? You're not going to come? Go up with her. Just do what she wants. Hurry. Dad. Dad, don't go. Don't go dad! Dad, don't go! Dear Lord, please kill both my father and that girl. Lord. You're doing this because of Chang-sun right? I can give you another child! You think you'll be a man if you hit me, right? My legs! He wants to eat breakfast on the second floor. I'll take it upstairs. You just go and make your bed. Take care of yourself. You don't look well. Enjoy your meal. Only my soup is sweet. Do you want to switch? She's trying to kill me so she put rat poison in my soup. That's crazy. I spilled the bottle of rat poison so I put sugar in there. I know she's trying to kill me! You're trying to kill me! Let's go to the police! You evil woman! You said you would find me a good husband, but instead you turn me into a dirty concubine. You murderer! You put rat poison in my food! You'll be executed for this. They should hang you. You evil woman! Please forgive me. I lost my mind and tried to kill you. I worked so hard to try and build a good life for my husband and children, but that was destroyed in one night. It made me crazy, please forgive me. I'll do anything, just forgive me. Forgive me just this once. Forgive me. Fine. But you have to give me everything. Your husband, your money, your jewelry! Register me as part of your family. What do you say? If you register me than I'll become your legal wife. She will become nothing. I didn't take her place, she gave it to me willingly! Now, everything is mine! All mine! - What... -It's all mine. Oh Lord. Lord. No. You can't have that ring! It's a small price to pay for me not going to the police! This ring represents our marriage! I lost something you can't buy with money! Honey. Just let it go. - No! - Honey! - Let me go! - Honey! Let me go. Do you think it's ok to seduce someone else's wife? You promised you would give me Myeong-ja in return for cutting my pay. You should just be a pimp! You turned her into a prostitute! I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know anything. What's going on? I thought he would be a good husband for Myeong-ja. You should have talked to me about it first. He saw you with her. You seduced my wife! You're crazy! Just clean up the chicken droppings and stop talking nonsense. You're dirtier than chicken droppings! You think you can look down on me. - Look down on me? - Help me! Die, just die! - You disgusting woman! - What is going on here? Let me go! This is turning into a big mess. What's happening here. - Let me go! - You jerk! I can't believe this. Now you're really in trouble. If I sue you for injuring me, it's six months in prison. You can either give me ten million won or give me Myeong-ja. I'll wait downstairs for your decision. Let's give him Myeong-ja. No. Let's let Myeong-ja go! I'm not going anywhere. This is all for you. Let's just think about it. - I can't leave you, even for a moment. - Come on. I said, come here! Let's discuss this. I can't leave you. We'll die if we don't do anything. We'll get sued and lose everything. Go downstairs and fix him up. Me? Who else then? I don't want to. I won't! I'd rather die! When you hit him, something happened to him. He wouldn't wake up no matter how much I shook him. What are you talking about? Is he dead? Do you think he's dead? The body... we need to get rid of it. Do you want to be falsely accused of murder? You killed him and you're trying to pin this on us? What are you talking about? How can a woman kill someone? Even the police won't believe it. A woman can't kill anyone. It's not me! Not me! I have no choice but to turn myself in. No! Leave it to me. If we get rid of the body, nobody will know. There's a way to do this without leaving any evidence. How? It's better if you don't know. I'll take care of this. Go back upstairs. Go! What is that sound? That is the sound of your wife putting the body into the meat grinder, and turning it into chicken feed! As long as the chickens eat the body, it will disappear forever. That's not possible! Not possible! I'm scared! She's so cruel. It's horrible! Yesterday's feed must have been good, the eggs are all large. I forgot to clean the machine. The body is gone. - I did this for you Myeong-ja. - What? You killed him and I took care of the loose ends. I didn't kill him. You're barking up the wrong tree. You like eggs right? Eat this. If you don't eat it, I'll be suspicious. The chickens are pecking me to death! I'm scared! Kill me! What's wrong with you tonight? - You're crazy. - I'm afraid! It's been a long time. Is your husband here? Isn't it a little late? The housekeeper is home, right? You should teach her some manners. Is it ok for her to be so cocky? You surprised me. I almost had a heart attack. Hye-ok is here. She said I should teach you a lesson because you're too cocky. That bitch. It's not going to smell like a dirty dishcloth, is it? I'll take this song. Think of it as consolation. I'm sorry. I can't believe you were with the housekeeper. Just be happy that the rumor hasn't spread. Thank you. I can't believe I wanted to give you everything I had. All I got for it was seeing how dirty sex was. You disappointed me and made my heart ache. You're an awful man. You awful man! Awful man! Let go. You think I'm cocky? I'll teach you a lesson! What do to you think you're doing? Let go! It's life or death! Help me! Help me! - Help me. - Let me go! She needs to be taught a lesson, - for everyone's sake. - Come here! Why can't you calm down? If I tell people, nobody will come to this dirty place! Have a nice life! Listen to me! It's all over for us if you stir things up. You can't tell anyone. Calm down! You didn't pay her. Instead you promised to find her a good husband. The best you could do was your own husband. You pretended to take her to the hospital for a check-up and aborted the baby. How can you kick her out empty-handed? Even if I asked her to stay she can't. What's wrong with you? What's going on? How much are you going to give her? - 20,000 eggs. - 20,000? That's a million won. Are you kidding me? Otherwise, she can leave empty-handed. You killed him! No! The rotting body is going to smell. What should we do? It wasn't me! Hey... Why are you running away? This is horrible. I'm scared! The body is rotting! You killed him, didn't you? Turn yourself in. It wasn't me. He died of a disease. Why is there blood on the shovel? What are you two doing? - The body is mixed with the sewage. - What? The body is mixed with the bottles. She's trying to use it as evidence that I killed him. His wounds aren't consistent with you hitting him. He was hit with the shovel. You're trying to blame me. How are you going to blame this on me? If I'm arrested for murder do you think you're going to walk away unscathed? We'll testify that you were raped and it was self-defense. I don't know what you're talking about. You can make up whatever you want. Do whatever you like! Turn her in. You didn't kill him. It was her! I killed him. Honey! She's made you crazy. As the head of household, you need to provide for your family yet you're willing to go to jail?? Convince her to turn herself in. You have to do it! Get out. You're a terrible person. Get out. Myeong-ja. Please help us. I worked so hard to get this family to where it is. You know I hired you so I could finally take a break, don't you? We're both women so I know you'll understand. I think of you as a sister. I treated you like family. Was that so wrong? Who cares. I can't hear or see anything! I'm begging you Myeong-ja. Please save our family. Please don't make my husband an outcast. He's weak, he might even kill himself. I'll do whatever you ask. If you want me to go to jail, I will. If you want me to die, I will. In return, just one night... let me serve him. What... You were granted permission so I'll grant you your wish. Are you going to perform an exorcism? I wanted to be a dancer but I thought it would be too hard, so I quit. Are you saying having a dream means sacrifice? So you're saying that in front of God there are no dreams. You're going to get another cramp in your leg. As long as you're happy I'm not afraid of anything. Let me have a drink first. Isn't that rat poison? My body will only serve you. Nobody else can touch it. Thank you for loving me like your own child. Are you going to do something rash? It's better that I die. If I turn myself in, you're going to get in trouble. No... Myeong-ja. How much pain do you have to be in to make a decision like this. You're so innocent. So pitiful! You poor thing. You poor thing. You drink the rest. I made it so we could die together. It's the perfect end for two people who love each other. I won't do it. You want me to die alone? I have a family. I still have too much to do. They're meaningless things. You scare me. You're not going to drink it? I sent Kyeong-hui a will. It said you tried to ruin me. That you tried to pin a murder on me, and if that wasn't enough you tried to feed me rat poison to kill me and get rid of any evidence. You're lying. It's a trap! You created this mess and didn't even try to fix it. You are insincere. You ruined everything. You have to die. There's nowhere to run. If I die, my wife... she'll say I was selfish. We may be husband and wife but in the end I lived the way I wanted. Drink it. Drink it! Drink it before I die. I'm too scared to die alone. Now what's left? What's left? What can we do? What can we do? When you die, what is there to see? What you die, what is there to hear? When you die there's nothing, this is all there is. Then I'm to be pitied. The only thing I know is the cramp in my leg. I can't hear anything or see anything. In the end, we're nothing but dirt and rocks. I gave you everything you wanted. I gave you my life and my body. But in the end, I can't give myself to you. Who are you going to give yourself to? To my wife. No! You can't give her anything. Where are you going? To my wife. I have a request. If she doesn't grant my wish while I'm alive, I won't die. I can't see anything. Honey, where are you? Honey... Let's go together. Honey. Honey. Honey! Honey! What... Honey! Honey! What's happened? I can't see anything. Myeong-ja put rat poison in the alcohol and made us drink it. I had no choice. I felt so sorry for her. What... I let her get to me. He's mine. We have to die together. Let's die together. Let's go to the hospital. It's no use. Listen to me. Don't let the world know I had an affair with the housekeeper. Also... What would people say about you and the kids. Don't die. Don't die. It's ok. I can't see anything. Where are you? Honey, stab me in the back and make it look like a burglar robbed me. Pretend that's what happened. How can I stick a knife in your body? Please, I'm begging. Save me from this dirty life. Pull my body out. Please. Let's go together. Honey... Honey. Honey. Die with me. Let's die together. Die with me. Honey... Let's die together. Die with me. Let's die together. Together. Let's die together. Please. If I stab him, will the police figure it out? But how can I stab my husband. That's right, just think how much you hate him. No. I've never hated my husband. I've never disliked him. I don't need to fool the police. But... what will happen to him? You ruined our family! Knowing you stabbed your husband is like being in a living hell. It's better to cover this up to protect your family name. I'd like to take my husband and the girl's ashes. We did everything we could to solve this case. Please understand. She pretended to be a friend and conspired with others to get with my husband. As his wife, should I be subjected to this kind of treatment? Detective? That girl should be pitied. Even in death she wants special treatment. I'll never forgive her. Let's scatter her ashes. She'll go back to being dirt. What's important is what you treasure in your heart. Mom, is there really a God? I prayed that God would kill dad and Myeong-ja. When you're dad asked me for ten million won to take care of things, I told him it would be better to die. Mom! The bottle... the ones that dad made us bury. Myeong-ja. Chang-sun. Me. You. Mom! There are fish in your bottle. Mom, it's your lucky day! It's your lucky day! It's my lucky day? That's why your dad left me behind. I couldn't die for your father. Honey! Mom! Honey! Mom! Honey!
