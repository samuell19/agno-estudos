Hey... um... It's... um... it's me again. Uh... I've been trying to call you all morning... Um... I really just need to see you for a bit, I think... I... I'm feeling really tired of everything all of a sudden and I can't fucking breathe or sleep or eat much and they've got me on... on pills now and mom's researching all these clinics online... you know talking about how maybe this isn't a good environment for me anymore... or whatever... I don't know... So... I'm feeling... I'm feeling really... I'm feeling really fucked up and... yeah um... I just don't know what would be the... the thing to do. Remember when we talked about how... how... how it must be to drift above things... above everything. Just be far, far up, looking down and air moving and... and light... Suppose you're busy or sleeping or out or whatever so... If you... if you get this call me if you want to, or don't... your call. But yeah... if not, then... Yeah... see you around... alright bye. Yes. No no no no You're completely wrong on that side. I specifically remember telling you... that... yes... No no no, we've been... I told you before we even got close to signing on this contract, Lionel Well that's because you should listen to me more often. Right. Sweetie, come help mommy please. Yeah and there's not... There's nothing we can lose on it. Mom... Mommy... Mom... Jenny please, I'm on the phone. Hey man, hurry up, something is going wrong! Eish madam Go ask for help... Boss! It's a very important contract. Take this, take this chair, get on it and cut it off. Hurry up! Hurry up man. Hold her here. Hold her, hold her. On the 16th of June, 2013 Emily turned out the lights and set her mother's house on fire. This is what Joburg looked like June 25, 2014. Doesn't look like much. And it appears so 'cause it isn't. Suppose it might be hard to figure now but it used to be real, real nice around here. Maybe not in a lot of ways but the photographs used to look better than these. Every now and then you'll find some old folk and they'll say Yahsis, my laaitie, huh? You know, when I was your age, Hillbrow That was where it was. All the girls there... pretty... standing outside the clubs at night. In those times my laaitie, men were men. Sophiatown and the sound of jazz sitting on the night like new perfume.... Woah man... Joburg must have been a sight in the 80's. They'll say things like "It never used to be like this." And what good is that doing anyone now? You know all our lives Joburg's been really shitty and no one from our side of town ever goes there. It's no wonder Joburg's shit. This is the northern suburbs. Me and my friends live here. And I suppose somewhere that counts for something. And things been pretty good since they did away with that... that whole apartheid shit. That's a good one to mention for the undecided tourist. You know, I think it was... grade four... Yeah, it was grade four... I remember this teacher got everyone involved in this compulsory raffle drive. I think it was for this underprivileged school somewhere in like an ultra fucked up part of Africa. They show you these pictures and these kids look hungry. And they look like they really want to learn. So, we go out and we take these tickets home. Start selling these tickets and you start selling these tickets, and you start selling these tickets and you start selling these tickets and you're making a fucking killing 'cause now they made sure the tickets are real cheap. A week or so into it, it's you, a mess ton of like loose change, and you're rich as fuck kid. Now, I mean like, you're this kid, who knows shit about anything with a handfull of these sad pictures of black kids you've never met in your life and you're trying to get your sales done right? So... so on the last day we all, we all sat down with our tins of coins and ticket stubs and... I'll never shake this man... Sitting next to me was this kid Gerald, and he looks at the teacher with this overwhelming conviction about him and he's like and he literally says to her "My folks think it's not good to give money to people who haven't worked an honest day's job in their lives..." "Nothing is free in life..." "and we shouldn't be responsible for everybody." Now the only reason I bring that up is 'cause I think that's how... Well that could sum up how most people think in my city... about most things... in one way or another. People don't really want to help each other out. It's that simple. Ag man, these politicians are messing us around. Every two days there is always something, if it's not Malema then it's this Zuma. It's just scandal after scandal after scandal. And this side it's Nkandla. Look now, here's another madness. This side others are forming alliances and you can't figure out what's happening. They want to fight, these people. I'm telling you, it's a totally different type of politics. You can't figure out what's happening. It's like these people want to be entertainers instead of running a country. It's like that, it's like that, my love. You cannot expect everyone to be like Mandela. There was only one Mandela and even him, it was just sheer luck. Hey... You there? Yo, what's good man? This fucking nigga. Where the fuck have you been man? I've been trying to... I've been trying to holler at you the past like seven fucking days man you fucking fall off or what? Fucking... Tupuc's ghost... hologram lifestyles G. Nah I'm around man I'm at my mom's place taking it easy... You're... you're not serious about your trick game at all... I ain't even about that life right now, son. I've been trying to chill out... You know, take it easy figure out what's going on with uni next year or whatever, you know? Last night... I'm on my basic, every night casual flex and I got this girl, fucking Rafi, and she's getting at me like "Hey, you're super close friends with Jabz, right?" And you're holding your mom's fucking hand like it's a grade six picnic - Are you joking? - That's fucked up Yeah she's... she's definitely one of the like baddest tricks around since... since she been fucking around with Matty Hartford she's been like wilding non-stop I'd be... I'd be more than happy to fine dine the bitch myself if my dad didn't have me on this fucking gay-ass cut off... I don't know man. You know you stupid as fuck for that one though right? Like constantly wilding out, acting like a god damn fucking idiot. Dude, I think it's a miracle your parents haven't sent you back to motherfucking Natal. Go raise cattle and kill cattle with your uncles and shit man. And fucking... it's a possibility the way you going on acting like you got no parents and shit. Apparently... apparently the story there is that... you know she... she was doing like heroin and shit with Matty since she was like fourteen or whatever so she didn't get those like sex hormones that girls get when they are like fifteen or whatever so now it's like a case of genuine like... six years build up of that shit and she... she has to fuck. What do you mean, has to? That makes no sense at all dude. Dude, I don't know how that shit works. You know what I mean, I don't know how it works. It's like... Bogosi was... Bogosi was trying to throw me up on that knowledge and he did... he did like Matric biology... so I'm... I'm just, I'm trusting a nigga. Well speaking of... are we getting faded today or what? We're over at the park. So I don't know what your flex is all about. I mean, if you're swinging by and you want to pick me up, but I ain't got no dollar bills, you know... So if we can maybe organize some kind of... um... Alright I'll organise. Sorry, I haven't done anything like this before, um... Where must I... do I look at you? That's fine... um... You just speak directly to me as if we having a conversation. Yeah I... I knew Emily as well as anyone in our group did or... um... could have known her. We've been... I mean, we had been friends since the start of school and everything and... Yeah... Me, her and Tanya would hang out a lot at parties on the weekends and whatever, um... but.... uh... um, but other than that... ah... ja, now, now it seems like I didn't know so much about her, um... Ja, I don't... I don't think any of us really did... May... Maybe Jabz? Ah... But... um... fuck... um... Ja, no, I... I wish I knew her a lot better than just goofing around, um... Ja, and it's, it's strange because since she did it... I kind of feel like I do somehow. So you weren't intimate? You think I can borrow the car for a bit? Got to go see my ma... Christ she's been acting super fucking weird the past couple of weeks. Talking like super desperate all the time. Giving me this massive guilt trip of... "Oh, you never want to come home anymore." "I'm at home all day and night, alone now." "Your brothers never want to come home." "You're out in the city doing god knows what." So I'm going to breakfast with her quick. I have to show her she's loved by someone. I reckon in her case it would be less of a fucking bother to not be around anymore as fucked up as that is to say about someone. How do you figure that? She just wants you guys to come over once in a while. Your mom's just at that age you know. Everything's moving on. You guys are getting older. Mothers get that way. She cooked for you everyday of her life. What's going to make her happy though? Like at this point. I mean Rob's been out the house since I was in highshool. Tony's married now. Lives in fucking Cape Town, like... Yeah. I don't know. I'm convinced people have a time in the world. Yeah? And what time is that? Like my mom, right? She's been wasting away since my dad died. Not in the way that anyone who didn't know her would notice but slowly over time... just becoming less her. Less magical. Less interested in the world. She hardly wants to go out anymore, or make herself pretty and it's 'cause he's gone. I wonder... If she knew that my dad was that time in the world for her and that afterwards nothing would matter as much maybe she would have gone when he went and saved herself the sadness and heartaches. I don't reckon that... I don't reckon... anyone ever sees it... or look at it like that... ever. When shit's really sour and you've lost your job or something then for the first time people look at life and death and there's something to consider. But most people most people are optimistic. What? Everyone thinks good shit's going to happen eventually. Which isn't the worst thing, I mean... otherwise we'd all just quit our jobs and throw ourselves out a window. We couldn't live like that. Life would be too short. Sure... but a lot more honest. You mean... you think... she thought about it like that? I think she wanted everyone to know that things aren't like they should be. Fucking live stream, you know... It's brutal. Ten million people saw that. She didn't want it to be nothing. It means something right? Just a sad kid. This time it's done. Ja, but why? You know how many bitches you fucked? And then everytime it's a different excuse about what's wrong with her... I'm needy. She's so clingy. Whatever, come on. Ja dude, but you know, she's fucked! Like, I mean, like, she's proper proper fucked, you know? Like completely fucked. - What kind of fucked though? - Dude, I mean, you know like... I wish... Dude, I mean, you know it's the same shit, like every three days... just, one second it's on, then it's off you know, then she's fighting with her mom... Where do you find these bitches? - Ja, I don't even know, dude... - Fucking Oxford road or something? Nah dude, good family, that's the fucked up thing, you know? Like her mom is just like one of those prescription pill fiends, dude. Every time I check the bitch, she's fucking zoning out... You know the first time that we actually like sitting in bed together fucking staying up the whole night, telling me stories about how her mom is so fucking depressed and the whole time she's gonna tell her dad she's gonna kill herself until one night, fucking they call the doctors and send the bitch straight to the looney house dude. Now she's there, bitch is full of pills and you know like, and then daddy just fucking don't even get me started on her dad... What's up with him? I mean, I just don't even know if he's like purposely ignorant or just like dumb as fuck. Some people are born dumber than others. - Dude this guy was born blind and just got worse... - How does he not know that all this shit is going on? He doesn't know anything, like he just gives her cash, you know and I'm not talking small change, I'm talking like seven, eight K a week. - What the fuck does she do with that? - For what? You know, and so like... petrol card, fridge stacked, her own house and shit, her own car living the dream, guys there week after week after week - just basically fucking the life out of daddy's little girl - Shotgun! Next time, next time. Ja bro, get in line dude Sign me up Speaking of lines bro... And then you know, fucking you know... I guess... I guess I'm just tired of this larney girl bullshit, you know like... cry fucking cry, boo hoo, my best friend won't talk to me for a week shit dude I mean there's far too much rape and murder on the streets to worry about... some dumb little girl's bullshit, just to get some pussy bro Forget it! Fuck it Matty, I feel you. - Ja, straight dude - You gotta walk away bro Walked dude, walked. Crawled nevermind... tail between legs - Fucking - Walk your way through this guy bro This nose was made for walking So what's the flex? So, man, you remember after Emily staying with my parents for wilding out all fucking crazy and shit? Yeah yeah And they sent me to that Crescent place? - Yeah - Word. Like... they put you up in this fancy-ass like hospital room Yo - With a lounge - What? motherfucking coffee shop nigga - Jesus - Motherfucking big screen, like... like big-ass screen, like... chandeliers in your face... Jesus, that's some fucking glimmer lifestyles my nigga. Dawg, you just watch these doctors make these pills that keep you high the whole day, finish. And like ever since then man, I got this shit on script. - What? - Yip So, Tanya went to rehab as well? Um... I don't know man I don't think it was like a rehab rehab for drugs and shit but I know that... you know, her parents sent her away for some like wrist slitting shit or whatever. Yeah man, like everyone was just on some some panicky shit the past two years dude. Like after Emily's thing? Yeah dude, I don't know. So yeah, home girl needed to mellow out and whatever and that's fucking the craziest thing like she almost failed school 'cause of that shit. Let me get something dawg. Alright, I'm going to be in the back here. - Hello - Mr Mtethwa... How you doing? I'm good, and you? Great man, what can we do for you today? Um... I'd like to fill up on my Ativan script. So if I can get like, what, 15... 10 Zopidem. No luck with the sleep hey? Nah - Okay, let's see... - Not at all. How's your old man doing? Nah, he's cool Yeah, he's cool There we go. - Cool - Have a good one Thanks. It's like a... dark skinned Tom Cruise What's in your pocket? - Yo what? - Yo dude - What's in your pocket? Come here. - What are you... What are you doing? My brother, I have to quickly search you. Wait. You think, you think we came here to steal my man? You think we came here to steal? - Themba, what's the problem there? - No boss, there is no problem here. I just want to quickly search these boys before exit. No no no no, it's okay, it's okay... Don't you remember Jabulani? - Mr Mtembu's son - Yes, sorry boss. I'm just trying to keep this place sharp. Listen to your boss, brother. - Sorry boss. - It's okay, it's okay Themba. It's okay. - Fuck man. - It's all class. You got these... you got these miserable ass niggas who come from the kasi here to work every day and the last thing they wanna fucking see is two maybe jiggy, maybe wavy-looking heroes such as you and I doing best. You know what I mean? And the thing is I don't understand why everyone's crying. I don't understand. 'Cause like their life... their life is their life... It's still hard, I gotta, I gotta maintain... I gotta maintain my swag Dawg I gotta maintain my, my ho game - Yeah man - You know what I mean? I gotta maintain this. Every day. Every day I'm doing this. You know what I mean? And the thing is that it ain't even... - Thank you is it, is it... is it out of check? - Word The thing is that... it's not even like a white black thing anymore, you know what I mean? It's like... We're all black. So I don't understand why everyone has to, you know, be out here trying to kafferise the situation. What? Sometimes you just say things. Kaffarise? What the fuck is that? I think I just made 'kaffer' a verb Yeah Can't believe I just made 'kaffer' a verb I think you fucking did - Jesus - Boy, nigga... nigga Did you... are those... Did you steal that shit? Nigga Fuck, don't you have medical aid? Fuck those guys man Jesus, you gotta stop with the fucking kleptomania shit... Fuck them God damn Should've warn a vest or some shit. It's that vest weather. Jesus, how many of those things you gonna fucking take man? Dude the guideline says you can have like four so if you double that shit you can take like, eight to ten, should be fine What do you mean fucking double it? If the guideline... the guidline's like the maximum. You can't just now... dude and this is like... this ain't some children's shit, you know what I mean... It's codeine type shit man I think it's like four if you have cancer or some shit, you can't just now say, well the... the maximum says you should take four therefore you should take eight. - There's no fucking logic in that man... - Well dude, I did a whole pack of these and... I passed out on my mom's couch for like, six fucking hours dude That's exactly what I'm fucking talking... Dude, that shit's, that's, that's fucking insane... that's insane fucking behaviour my nigga But what's insane is how they sell this shit over the fucking counter Don't blame the medical companies for this shit my nigga. They've had a very clear 'take fucking four' 'take fucking four maximum.' You going to go and take ten and wake up like fucking four days later that's on you my nigga That's... that's totally... Don't blame anyone for that. I'm pretty sure you can fucking die from that. Well it... says 'Respiratory failure' so I'm sure you can Dude it says that on the fucking... Oh my god on the... on the bottle. You can definitely die from that. - Yeah, if you take like... - Geez, dude, that's now, how many is that? How many... - Fifteen? Sixteen? - Dude... dude All I'm saying is that your mother mustn't now call my house when you... can't even breathe and you sleeping this time and you driving... I don't want to hear any shit. Yes you can die from this shit September. Don't September me like this is a fucking joke... I'm gonna... I'm gonna be a ghost in three seconds you know what I mean? Let's go my nigga. The world was a real special place when we were little. 1995. Her house... with more empty spaces around it 'cause they hadn't built the new city then. There's never a time more beautiful. There was a bigger love floating around. The country was so new... and so was life for us. Everyone seemed so full of sentiment. Could have been the rainbow though, the possibility the whole country saw after the end of terror. I don't know... When great stuff happens, I guess people believing they could be whatever they always knew they were supposed to be... But that never lasts. People just go back to going backwards... eventually, and things turn to shit. With us, I suppose, it was like we... watched everything get less hopeful for everyone. Growing up is traumatic sometimes. I'm telling you, this alcohol that I'm drinking woman... You don't drink alcohol, you are so beautiful. You are destroying yourself. Men are problems! My man left me, moved out of the house and left me like that. - I would rather stay without a man. - Keep quiet baby girl. She's naughty, this one. What is she looking at up there? Can we please just... take it kind of slow? We can take it as slow as you want baby. I'm not... I mean, I don't want you to do anything... that you don't want to do. Hey? Hey I fucking love you. You know that right? I know. Come here. - Fuck. - What? What? Fuck. Mom Sorry, mom... I can't hear you, the line is bad. - Hi? Ah, okay, that's better. - What the fuck? Hi mom. How's it going? No, it's alright. Yes mom, I'll be home about six o'clock. No mom. I promise I won't drink, I have my car. Yes, I filled it up this morning. Okay... Yes, I love you too mom. Okay... Bye. How's it gents? What's up gents? Hey gents, how's it going, how's it going gents? What's up? Can we go inside? Sure. Ah, you'll see. Gents. Heita, heita You know what bro? There's one thing that is upsetting... You know what bro? Just let them be right. These boys... they walk around Jozi... thinking that they own it. - You know what, you talking the truth. - You see what I'm talking about. This is what I was just saying to you. Its true. My man, as I was saying, last week I was going to town with my mother, I just bump into this white girl, and she just swears at us, "Voertsek!" "Voertsek!" "You don't belong here!" I was there by Sandton, then I see a guy driving a beautiful car. And he's racing and accelerated at a green robot. And then there's this lady on my side busy complaining... then I'm like "Howzit?" and do you know what she said? "If only I can get a job." A job? Stop fooling us around, stop fooling us around. A white person? Stop fooling us around. You know what she said? She's there like, "Oh no, now all the brownies are taking over." Brownies? Brownies, my man. Eh, wena. Ja my man. Then you know what I said? I looked her straight in the eyes and said, go tell that uncle Steve of yours to go sell his Porsche. Tell me and come back and see if I actually give a shit. I guess it's hard to say if someone was acting weird if no one was really paying attention. We live in Sandton. You know? Everything is... nice. It's hard to explain. It's like, um... there was a girl at my church... and everyone was always saying how good she was and how perfect her faith was. She never made any mistakes. So, last year she overdosed on some drugs and everyone was so shocked. Everyone was looking at what they wanted to see. And who doesn't do that, you know? No one really looks at anyone until something happens. Do you think no one cared about Emily? No. Just that people don't really pay attention to what's happening to the guy next door. Everyone's living their own lives. Most people want to eat their Woolworths and be left alone. Most people don't have those demons. You and Emily were friends right? Do you think suicide is a sin? Sometimes I think... people get lonely... 'cause of how the world works. You look at a kid and... yeah, and there's nothing there but love, you know what I mean? But something happens to people and and then they forget how to give like that. And that's the saddest thing in the world. How do people stay happy then? Like I mean, not... not everyone's miserable. Jabz! Dawg. Are you zoning out or what the fuck my nigga? Keep your eyes... keep your eyes where they need to be my nigga. You can't just be fucking on some chills man. So anyway... so, last Friday right, I go out to like Hatfield right... I'm having a good time... So, we roll up there... there's these other girls, like three or four of them this one fucking chick ah... like Charlene or some shit one of those super Afrikaans-type names right? steps into the fucking front seat smelling like god damn cocoa butter like got an ass like you've only fucking seen in a god damn dream, you know what I mean? So, after a while, you know, drop her off, give her my number... we flexing, we flexing, we flexing. She's mad on those text messages. Then it's like on the watsapp, you know, and that shit's fucking popping off like crazy like... five minutes ago... one minute ago... Now. - Right now. Just now. - Right now. Just now. Exactly. So I take her out... You know, we go out to this really nice club, we go out to this really nice bar... like the night's getting dipped... so I'm thinking, fuck... go back to her place and you know like... - fucking, really get at it. - Flavour It's just my thinking right. Soon as we get to the top of the road... she... she's like "woah woah woah, wait up" I'm like, what do you mean wait up? She's like, I think it's... I think it's better you drop me drop me like here. Firstly I can't connect the dots, my feelings are a bit hurt, I'm... Wait, wait, like up the road? Like up the road from her fucking house she wants to be dropped off. But... whatever, you know what I mean. My thing that upsets me about this chick is like, we on this mad, crazy flex but, she says this shit like matter of fact. Like that's just the way shit is. You know what I mean, like if a... if someone's... if someone's lacing up like ninety one Air Jordans call the nigga old fashioned, you know what I mean, but if a nigga's racist like... call it what it is. Call it what it is, that's all I'm fucking saying. Nah man... That's what I don't get about you man. What are you doing fucking around with girls from Pretoria like you don't know what country you stay in? Dude, that's a completely rational thing, that's just like fucking an hour away from fucking Sandton. What did you expect? I expected that we'd have a nice time. I expected that maybe me and her would ah... would be flexing for a while, this is... this is my future wife god damn it. What you looking for? Coins What you mean? For what now? Ah, this generous nigga, that time... - Life's fucked up man - Jesus Like life is fucked up. Dawg, are you on the real? Is this, are you really on this shit? Wait, like on the real now, your fucking issue is that you think that everyone in life has this like hard fucking card everyone's like been through this like... ordeal like Jabz must now save the fucking world. Whatever. Trav? Yeah? You ever wonder where we go when we die? I try not to think about it if I'm honest. I just... um... got to believe there's something more out there, you know... something boundlessly beautiful somewhere um... hidden like just over that mark in the sky where our eyes stop seeing. Where? There. Fucking no-end towns, no-end jobs. Middle-class suburban shit. I mean... surely that isn't the end of everything we know. Like we die... and we're just dead. Are you afraid of dying? Sometimes I feel really excited by the idea... like, death is this vacation we all get to go on together. Um... but like... a forever vacation you don't need to come home from. That's fucking grim. Love... Dreams... Gone. Makes me want to cry. I don't really want to die, Trav. Right, are you comfortable September? I'm fucking comfortable. Ask me anything you want. Anything. What's this now, like... Is that... oh is that sound? Let's go for one. September interview, take one. I used to go to a mess of parties with this girl, right, and like... ...and like half way through the night, she's hooking up with like, some... some guy and every... every party it's like a different guy or there's just like some dramatic scene that she's involved in, right... It's like, every party that we'll go to, there's like, there's something that, like, involves this chick that's like, fucking completely out of hand Monday comes around... first period... she's chilling like, nothing fucking happened you know and everyone's like... you know, everyone's just... no one gave a fuck, you know... And her parents didn't notice? I don't know like, I don't... I can't really... I don't fucking know her parents, you know, but I can say from our side, you know, everyone's just like, everyone's hanging out... you know, everyone's... We all got our own shit. And there's certain types of kids that's just not gonna fucking handle that. You know? And there's nothing... parents or, you know it's not about that, it's just like she couldn't fucking handle, you know? Have you ever considered suicide? What like killing myself? Fuck These are some hard fucking questions for the wrong nigga, you know, like... White people do a lot of things that make no fucking sense. Oh my god, you're such a bullshitter! I'm not that gullible. I swear to god. Ten fingers, ten fingers on the Jewish Torah, I swear. My god, I came like three times. Dude, I've never... - What she knows how to... - Are you bullshitting me? Swear to god. I was dripping wet. - No but seriously, are you kidding right now? - Dude it was amazing, I'm actually getting wet right now. - Stop touching yourself, that's disgusting! - I'm not fucking touching myself Ew! You can't just hook up with a girl. Why not dude? - Because it's fucking gross. - She was... Dude, it was so sensual... and so sexy... - and like you would think like ew, she'd smell down there - Okay, stop describing it but she doesn't smell, it's just amazing I'm sure she did, I'm sure she reeked She did not, at all, I didn't really go down on her - like I, kind of... - Dude, did she smell like period? Why would she... Ew dude, I'm not doing rainbow kisses and that shit, that's disgusting. Man she was fat, period girl in high school. - What do you mean? - She was fat period girl, like... No dude, we were like... We were like in art class and I was sitting across from Justin and we were like sending each other notes and whatever, like you know how it is So I look over and there on the seat is like this big fucking wet patch of period - I swear to god, it was foul - Oh no fuck off, that's disgusting It was so disgusting, it even stank, I promise you, it was so gross. I did speak to mom and she was fine with it and just because you two don't speak to each other, doesn't mean... I just need more, I just need more. I'm seeing her tomorrow night so... Apparently like the Thai people are really nice... What? - Are you serious? - Dude, you don't understand You actually have to experience... not her, that's mine Rafi, honestly you can't just like fucking go and see a girl after you fucked her, like, who does that? You do that will all the uncircumsized cocks you fuck. Ja but it's different because... How is that different? I'm not turning lesbian. And what am I supposed to tell Tali and Rafi?

I mean, it's... it's hard to figure. Um... Only she can tell now. Yeah but surely you must have thought about it to some extent? So I mean, just in your opinion why do you think she did it in this manner? You know, putting her death out to the world like that is quite a statement to make. It's unusual even in the context of a suicide. Why do you think she live streamed her death? Immortality... I mean she can't die now. So I... you know, mission over, hanging over there, you know, she's got some Oprah magazines on the bed... - I love Oprah. Love her. - Right? I make myself comfortable. Got my legs on the fucking bed and shit. So then I'm just like, you know, I'm... I'm there flexing, reading a couple of pages, you know...

She's looking deep as fuck into my eyes right and I'm looking into her eyes, you know... and it's coming from left, it's coming from right. It's a fucking tennis game. I'm in the fucking mood...

Blacking in and out of whatever fucking phantom-mode dream I'm fucking on with this chick You know, all of a sudden... it's fucking over. You know what I mean, like, this is, this is what's happening with me. So I'm trying to check in on what's happening with her, and I look down... and she's just like, not home... you know what I mean. She's just staring at me... with this like blank fucking look. You know what I mean, like the craziest, like... fucking... Bitch is angry No like... like I... like I broke her or something. Woah It's alright, it's alright. Geez what's happening here?

Yeah, there was this one kid, yoh, internet gets super fucked up, there's this one kid, ah who was on Chat Roulette, What the fuck is Chat Roulette? Wait wait, I know. Chat Roulette is like chatting on some... a table that moves like a merry-go-round. No, you know what? Sometimes you get niggas posting stuff online, you know, of themselves wanking. That's not a lie man, I'm telling... I'm fucking serious, that is for real man, I'm telling you.

So these guys like, are just... they just get themselves off man, like... Did you do that? We fucking made a joke about it.

Hashtag, is she like posting selfies or some shit? By her tombstone nigga, there. Can the joint be passed around? Can it move? It hasn't been moving, that's all I've been noticing. It stopped, it stopped. I wanna go play roulette on that merry-go-round. - When you announce it... - I can't keep it in, I got to tell somebody... - It has to come out... - Get him to post that on roulette... - that you were flipping wasted or something... - Ja, but like, for real though like... the world is all going to be on the internet one day. And those two are making out over there. Get yourself a girlfriend dawg. Get a room. Yeah you get a room guy. Get a room dude. Sometimes I think about dying and... and it’s good. Yeah? Yeah. 'Cause I’m just floating. I’m floating nowhere near any place I know. I’m floating over everything. It’s like I’m moving and moving somewhere off the earth... and it’s beautiful there. You're such a creep. Oh my god, you psycho. Are you guys hungry? No, I'm fine. Dude, I'm not hungry, at all. I'm alright, thanks. You want some wine?

So you do not lick pussy, is that just like a thing in your life? - Baby! - You don't... But you've got those big, soft lips... - Pussy is not meant to be licked? - You guys... That's the biggest piece of bullshit I've ever heard in my life. Why are we even talking about this? It's fucking gross. Because it's facts. It's gender politics. Do you think you would... ever have your own family? What like a... like a wife and kids or whatever? Ja, exactly Fuck I don't know man, like I have this fucking basic philosophy, right and I just believe in general the ones you love, especially the ones you fucking love, those are the first people that will fucking switch you up you know what I mean like... My family's... my family's fucking... my family's shit... so fucking shit like... Once upon a time, I'm sure like, my mom and dad loved each other, you know what I mean, like - Ja tell me about it - but now like, I don't think... I don't even think they fucking like each other My parents don't talk to each other Mine don't... mine don't either, you know what I mean, and that's been like that since I was like, what like... since I was like fucking ten. So I end up being like, what the fuck? Like what do you... why would you... why would you have a family? ...if it's going to be broken... Can you guys imagine like... Three hundred years ago... Like... Joburg South Africa was like a... an African kingdom No buildings. Just space. Tribes. Just long, long like... vast spaces of land. You could have like large families. You could have like ten wives. And it was cool 'cause everyone loved each other. How do you know that everyone loved each other? It's a story Tal. Ja but I just want to know. I don't. That's just how I picture it. People are lost... 'cause the world's just separating all of us. It's faster and faster. It's like people are too clever to love. What happened to the earth? Sand...

One more, one more, one more. Alright. Ja, but you see, the thing you must understand about politics right, is that... is that I want you to understand about Zuma actually... Zuma does not give a shit about the people. The very people that put him there, no he does not. Ja, he just wants his... his very big house, you know? That can be the size of the rest of the... the whole of Sandton! - Yeah. - Ja, just one house, for one man. Sandton big. Ja and what about the people? There's people there in the squatter camps, you know that? Ja and, and... those people, it's so unfair for them because they put him up there. But him, he doesn't care. - Now where shall they live? - Yeah. It's unfair. And they've got children. You know. Who must feed them? Who must feed these people? Who must feed... Who must feed the children of these people? Who must take them to school? It's the tax payer. So my man, you must understand this one thing... - Alright. I should be getting to bed. - Me too. It's really good speaking to you. - You know, just... talking. - Yip, ja, any... any time yeah. - Alright. See you around. - Yeah. Yeah. - Okay, bye. - Bye. They walk apart. This photograph isn't romantic. People in romantic photographs walk together close and hold each other by the hand, skin to skin. Skin to skin in the hallway 'cause they wanna fuck. She shows him the pussy. This world is crazy. Hey man you got a light? Yeah. So what's um... what's been up with you man? What you mean man? I don't know man, you just kind of seem... you know, a little off your fucking game, you know? For real? Nah I'm fucking serious man. I don't know what it is man. It's like lately...

I read that one my nigga. They want answers man. They want answers to things I'm like... What the fuck? What in the fuck? "What are you going to do?" "What are your fucking plans?" Like I fucking have any man. I don't know man, it's like... fucking... I fucking hate this city man. You know sometimes I feel like... Joburg is just trying to kill me. Ten years from now man, fucking ten years from now... I'm just gonna be like... in some fucking crazy-ass place in like fucking Hollywood or some shit, you know what I mean? And like... Everyone will be like, "Yo September!", like hitting me up mad like... "We miss you man." "Come hang out." But I ain't never fucking coming back man, I ain't never coming back. I'm just going to be straight ghost, you know what I mean? This is the suburbs with the sound turned off... so you can really see it. Shapes, lines, shapes, lines... Somewhere in between them, a photograph of me and my best friend September on a corner. This is one of my favourite photographs. 'Cause this is us after 14 years together. And I love him like he loves me. And even though we never speak much about what we feel... I know he gets it. Dude, I'm not your fucking girlfriend man. Come on, what's that? Alright. - Get home B - Alright Don't fucking spend your whole life on fucking corners my nigga. On June 26, 2014 I went where she went. And most people blamed her for it. They said, “If he had never met her, or if she hadn’t done that..." "he would have never got it in his head to do the same.” I think the worst thing about it is leaving my friends behind. I never wanted to break their hearts, their hearts are all so broken already. At the end of it all, it could be Johannesburg or Washington or anywhere. You can ask the same million questions. Sometimes when kids are fucked up... there's just nothing you can do for them.
