[instrumental music] It's my favorite, mother. I baked it myself. I want today to be.. ...very special. Fine young man. I'm very proud of you. [sighs] One day you'll be a famous doctor. But that's ten years away. You keep delaying any treatment. Mother, you should... There are so many incompetents... Of course when you are away at college.. ...I'll be very lonely. You know, dinner was delicious and you know how much I love chocolate cake. It's hard to believe that.. ...this will be your last year of high school. Hm. Well, we both must enjoy it. Well, I'm, I'm lucky to have you to worry about me. We're both very fortunate.. ...to have each other. Eh, you know besides this being your birthday today.. ...well, um.. ...tomorrow is another anniversary of sorts. Ten years ago tomorrow your father and I were divorced. Never could understand why he hasn't come to see me. Oh, uh.. Well, I-I was entitled to alimony.. ...for all the trouble I was subjected to. But I waived it.. ...on the condition your father give up custody and visiting rights. Armand was very excited saving all that money. I don't think he ever cared about me at all. It's incredible. It has everything. Oh, but the salesman assured me it was the finest. But you shouldn't have spent so much money. Wow! Now I can illustrate my story. I don't want you occupying all your time with those extraordinary visions of fantasy. Atranta is not fantasy, it's real. You'll see. [door closes] - Where are you off to? - Oh, I won't be long. I'm going over to Laurie Matthews. You shouldn't waste your time with someone who doesn't care. Laurie, uh, there's someone here to see you. [chuckling] It's only water. Some people even wash with it, Ronald. [laughing] - Hi. - Ronald, what do you want? Well, I was just wandering around and I thought I'd come by and see what you were doing? Swimming. [water splashing] Come on in, Ronald. If you can swim, I mean. Or if you can't. [laughing] Would you like to go to the movies? There's a good double feature playing. I can't. I'm doing something else. - Good joke. - We'll see you later, Ronald. Yeah, bye, Ronald. Too bad that you can't stay so long. Take care. Stay dry. Don't forget to shut the, uh, gate. From the outside, Ronald. [chuckling] (female #1) Oh. [instrumental music] - Don't touch me. - I was only gonna help you up. Now look what you did, it's brand new, I'm a mess. Why didn't you get out of my way? Well, I didn't see you. You should watch where you're going, Carol. You sure are dressed up. Still trying to impress Laurie? Well, you should know she only likes football players and besides you're weird, Ronald. I am not weird. Yes, you are, and so is your mother. I want you to say you're sorry. I want you to say you're sorry. Let go of me. Say you're sorry. Let go of me, Frank's gonna get you for this. Say you're sorry. [intense music] Wake up. [sobbing] Why aren't you fooling? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (Elaine) Ronald? Ronald? Where have you been all this time? Matthews, I told you I was going there. What happened to your jacket? - I tore it on a fence. - What has happened? Ronald? Tell me. Now, it can't be that bad. It's worse. Much worse. I don't even know how to tell you. Tell me, try. I killed Carol Matthews. She said terrible things about me. I couldn't believe she was dead. It was an accident. [sighs] I found a shovel.. ...and I buried her. If it was an accident why did you bury her? That's what the police will ask. Ronald, you've made a terrible mistake. I was scared. I don't wanna go to jail. If only you hadn't buried her we probably could've proven your innocence. But now we, we can't afford the chance. Well, if only you listened to me. None of this would have happened. So many times I have warned you about those girls. And now.. What are they gonna do to me? [sobbing] If you are convicted there'd be no mercy for you. You could spend the rest of your life with de-degenerates in jail. And even if you're acquitted the publicity would ruin your chances for a medical career. O-okay, i-if you run away.. ...alone. [sighs] They'd catch you. I-it's a terrible mess. I wish it never happened. I don't wanna go away alone. Oh, I know, dear. Well, I don't want you to leave. We'll have to hide you.. ...until things quiet down. By then, I should have enough money saved. Uh, it would be a matter of moving. Of starting life again. Maybe I should turn myself in. No! Just listen to me. You should know I'm only concerned for your safety. Well, what if it doesn't work? What if they catch me? Now listen and get a hold of yourself. The police eventually will come around to you. A-a-and we don't have any time. Now if we don't have confidence in each other.. ...you won't have a chance. What about the shed? That's the first place they'll look. (Ronald) I used to hide in the attic. No, you're not thinking, Ronald. The bath. It's perfect! Get your toolkit. Look.. ...you'll be able to live in decency and cleanliness. You'll have plenty of room and no one will know. We've got some old plaster board and some extra wallpaper upstairs. Now take off the door. We'll have to work through the night. We must be careful not to leave any track. I think it's undetectable. Absolutely. It's the perfect illusion. How long will it be before it's safe to leave? I don't know. Probably a couple of months at least. We have no choice but to be patient. Well, I hope it won't be that long. As soon as it's possible, we'll leave. Until that time, your daily activities will be quite normal. Have you got everything inside? You must learn to be quiet. I must be the only one who knows you're here. Now, get back inside. (Ronald) I hinged the door from inside. The latch is in place. Well, it's a fine job, Ronald. Um, two knocks will mean danger and uh, four, safe. Close the door. [instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] [knocking] [doorbell ringing] Mrs. Wilby? Yes. What do you want? Oh, uh, we're from the police, Mrs. Wilby. (Lynch) I'm Sergeant Lynch, this is Sergeant Tyler. Can we come in? Thank you. Is Ronald Wilby your son? Of course he's my son. He's a wonderful boy. (Lynch) Can we sit down? What is it about Ronald? Well it's official business, Mrs. Wilby and not very pleasant. I should advise you it'll be wise to have a lawyer present while we'll be questioning Ronald. Ronald isn't here. Uh, he, he left, night before last. Uh, quite upset I guess He really wasn't himself. I've been waiting for him to return. - Where is he? - I don't know where he is. Has anything happened to him? Um, ma'am, uh, yesterday evening a young girl, Carol Matthews was found dead behind the Hastings place. and she was buried in a shallow grave and we estimate she died between 5:00 and 7 p.m. the night before that. Now we know Ronald left the Matthews house around 5 p.m. that night. Did he come home anytime around 7:00? That's absurd. What nerve you have.. ...making such accusations. Well, we're not accusing Ronald of anything. Ronald would never do such a thing. He's a gentle person. Well, do you mind if we could look around? Of course I do. But you're wrong. Uh, look around as much as you like. But please don't mess up the place. My son is not a killer. But he is missing, ma'am. Teenagers are always running away. [door opens] [door shuts] [closet sliding] [sighs] Do you recognize this coat, ma'am? Obviously, you got it from Ronald's room. (Lynch) It does belong to him. (Elaine) Yes, it belongs to him. Well, we found a smutch of clothing caught on a fence in the Hastings house. And it looks like it'll match this tear. That doesn't prove a thing. This coat fits the description of what he was wearing when he left. There's also some trace of blood. (Sgt. Carter) Some soil in the pad of his tennis shoe. It looks pretty much like the stuff where we found the girl. - And there was a note. - Note? "Dear mother, I've done something awful. "I'm very sorry to cause you unhappiness. Ronald." We found it in his room. Well, he ha-hasn't confessed anything. The young girl was always teasing the boy. Now, if Ronald killed the Matthews girl.. ...he should be caught. My son is a decent human being. [sighs] Ma'am, you're divorced from his father? Yes, and how would you know that? Your neighbor, Mrs. Schumacher, ma'am. She was trying to be helpful. Always got her nose into everyone's business. Is Ronald likely to contact him? Hardly. He has no affection for his father. Do you have any idea where he might go? None. You didn't have to knock. I knew there wasn't anyone here. Practice is important. It's now a matter of survival. Ronald, that note was a brilliant idea. They'll be sure you've run away. I'm sorry I made all this trouble. Everything will work out as long as we're careful. Look, you must stay in the lair until we leave. Mrs. Schumacher is watching our house like a hawk. Alright. Now close the door. - Good morning, dear. - Good morning. Did you sleep well? Yeah. - Mother? - Get back inside! I'm alright. [sniffles] Don't forget your exercises after breakfast. If you don't keep fit, your health will deteriorate. All will be for nothing if we don't heed the rules. Today I begin drawing Princess Fen Seta. She's the ruler of the Atranta. She's very beautiful. Your studies are far more important than fairy tales. I know, mother. [instrumental music] [music continues] [creaking] [music continues] [music continues] [door creaking] [door closes] [sighs] [knocking] I'm starved. Be sure to comb your hair before dinner. You'll have to store these canned goods inside. I heard some noises today. There was someone snooping around outside, I'm sure. Mrs. Schumacher. She doesn't take her eyes off the place. I did two sets of exercises. - It's a lot easier now. - And your studies? One chapter of chem and two chapters of trigonometry. Good. [doorbell ringing] [sighs] Hi, may I come in? - Have you heard from him? - No. It's like he vanished into thin air. Not even a trace. Well, wherever he is, I.. I hope he lives a good life to make up for what's happened. Now, that's a noble sentiment, ma'am. But you know the, uh legal involvement for trying to help him. (Elaine) Yes, that would be an accessory. Uh, have you been in touch with his father? Yes, we have. He claims to have heard nothing. Then we take the assertions of a parent with a grain of salt. Well, what, what was his reaction? Oh, shocked. Same as you. [door creaking] [dramatic music] [music continues] I saw Carol Matthews' mother at the market today. She was very kind. Her son was with her. Duane was not at all sympathetic. He said some very cruel things about you. He's always said those things about me. I also saw Dr. Harris today. He said I had to have an operation on my gall bladder. Immediately. So, I'm going into the hospital tomorrow. I'll be gone just a week. A week? [knocking] Here. Your meals won't be exciting but you'll be able to feed yourself while I'm gone. I'll be sure and study. And exercise. I know it'll be easy for you to become careless without my attention but you must not break the routine. Now, close the door. Mother, I'm afraid. There is nothing to be afraid of as long as you listen to me. Now, close the door. And don't open it until I return. [dramatic music] [music continues] [telephone ringing] [music continues] [music continues] [door creaks] [footsteps] [dramatic music] [whispers] Mother! I hardly remember the house. It's been such a long time. Mr. Wilby wants to sell the home as soon as possible. Whatever you don't want goes to charity. I can't believe she's dead. It was to have been such a simple operation. (Mr. Roscoe) Well, why don't you take a look around? Make a note of what you want. And it is very hard for me to think of her as the mother of that terrible boy. [intense music] [door creaks] [music continues] [music continues] [intense music] [music continues] [leaves rustling] [door opens] Oh, my! They didn't stint on space in those days. Just look at those ceilings. (Mrs. Wood) Oh, it's wonderful. [Mrs. Wood chuckles] I've never seen a house with such character before. Oh.. It's magnificent. I-I'd like to see the rest of it. (Mr. Roscoe) Fine. Right up the stairs. - The kitchen's this way. - Hm. We need a new kitchen. And the whole place is filthy. Well, I admit it's a far cry from being immaculate but it is a bargain. Yes, except for one thing and I don't understand why would a four-bedroom house just have one bathroom? Doesn't make sense. I mean, I grant you it's, it's a large bathroom but, Mr. Roscoe, with three doors. Bathrooms just weren't that important when the house was built. N-now, look at those moldings. Yes, I suppose you're right. I mean, it's the most wonderful Victorian house I've ever seen. But all the work.. Mrs. Wood, with a little sprucing you'll have it restored to perfection. We're gonna need a new kitchen and certainly a new bathroom. What about the plumbing in an old house like this? (Mr. Roscoe) Mrs. Wood, you'll have it restored to perfection. [intense music] [sighs] (Mrs. Wood) It does have great possibilities. (Althea) Yeah, it does. Oh, we need a new bathroom too but I want the bedroom right upstairs.. - No, I get the one.. - No! (Althea) Daddy has something to say. (Mr. Wood) I don't know. What do you think? Well, I don't know either.. [indistinct chatter] (Babs) I'll stay if you can get rid of the dusty odor. (both) Musty, ha-ha. We can, darling, we can. (Althea) I-it's interesting. I guess I just don't like sterile things. Don't you think it has a lot of character? Has anybody seen our new neighbor? She wasn't very friendly when I said hello. (Ellen) Well, your shyness probably startled her. Oh, look who's talkin'. Althea, Ellen, now, come on, ladies. - It's awfully dreary. - Mm-hm. But it does have great possibilities. (Mr. Wood) Alright... wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, girls. Wait a minute, hold it now, h-hold, w-w-wait.. Wait a minute! Hold it! What is it, darling? Look, I would, I would like to make a decision today. Yes, so would I. So, uh, what do you say? Well, I'm for it. - I love it! - Me too! - I think it's a crazy house. - Ugh! [chuckles] What does that mean? Like the houses you see in movies. You watch too much television. [imitates Ellen] You watch too much television. Look, most of those old Victorian houses had strange reputations, but they weren't deserved. Babs! Maybe there's even a ghost or two. Ooh! Alright, that's enough, that's enough of that now. Cut that out. Now, look, are we for it or not? I say yes. - Yeah! - Yeah. Babs? Okay. [all cheering] (Babs) Leave me alone. You're as beautiful as a princess. You must be the one. Wait here on the porch for one second.. - Don't throw it hard. - B-behind the back. - Can you get it? - Alright. Yeah. - Great! - Hey! And that was even far off.. - Well, that's good. - Pretty good. Daddy! Hi, baby. - How are you? Good. - How's work? Good, thank you. Daddy, this is Duane Matthews. It's a pleasure, Mr. Wood. So, you are the mystery man, huh? Sir? Oh, everyday I come home from work I find half the garbage has been towed away. [both chuckle] That's a big help, Duane. Thank you. - See you, dad. - Thank you. Well, it's, it's you daughters, sir. They're merciless slave drivers. Are they? Are you a slave driver? - No! - You bet. It's looking a lot better inside now, huh? Beautiful! You know, I'd never know it's the same place. (Mr. Wood) Yeah, I'll see you later. Hey, wait till the outside's painted. Come on! You know, I think this house is gonna bring us good luck. Yeah. Old house like this, you feel like.. - It has its own memories. - Yeah. (Mr. Wood) Sort of grows on you. I must say, at the beginning I.. ...I had my reservations. So did I. Especially when they accepted our first offer. [both chuckle] My only complaint is that long line at the bathroom. (Mr. Wood) Yeah. Well.. [sighs] I'll get an estimate first of next week. But I don't, uh, I don't know where we'll put it, there's no room upstairs. Ready. Everybody at the table, honey. I'll cut the lamb. - Ellen, pass these on. - Okay. - Duane. - Who wants what to drink now? - What do you want to drink? - I'd like some milk. - I'll have milk. - Uh.. (Ellen) Mom, Duane would like a milk and I'd like a milk too, please. - I'm having a milk tonight. - Pass these on, will you? Let me, honey, let me have a beer. I put one in the freezer, see if it's cold. - Will you, please? - Yep. Thank you. Well, what do you think of our house, Wayne? Duane, daddy. Duane, that's what I said. What do you think of the house, Duane? I never thought I'd be eating here. Well, why'd you say that? Oh, I like, I like the house. It's really nice. - Why did you say that? - It's nothing. You must've had a reason for saying that. Ronald Wilby.. ...he lived here before you moved in. - So? - And? He murdered my sister. [spoon clatters] That's right, Ben, I-I remember reading about that. This house is evil. Just like Babs said. Honey, please. Don't start on that again, alright? I'm sorry. It's okay. [sighs] Oh, my. What happened to him? I don't know. The police never found him. [intense music] [music continues] Okay. Do we have everything? Mm-hm. Everything but the food. [music continues] [engine revving] [intense music] [gasps] They'll blame this on me too. [music continues] Mrs. Schumacher? [music continues] [music continues] [sighs] Althea, did you hear something break a few moments ago? Scared me to death. I didn't hear anything. Why am I the only one who ever hears anything? Because you're the only one crazy enough to believe in such things. Evil spirits.. Babs, come on! You don't believe in anything supernatural? I-I didn't say that. I only think you're getting worked up over nothing. [intense music] [music continues] I hope you make reservations for our trip. You're always forgetting. Yeah, I'll take care of it today. I'll, um, I'll get those sprinklers too. Did anybody hear anything break last night? Like glass? - No. - No. Dad... we've have been preoccupied with ghosts and spirits ever since we moved in here. Honey, look, all old houses make noises. Settling, plumbing, wind going through the shingles and all kinds of noises, you understand? I heard glass breaking. I know something broke. (Mrs. Wood) But I didn't see any glass on the floor this morning. (Ellen) Mm, glad our ghost keeps a tidy house. Babs, are you possessed? [Althea laughs] Hey, look, will you two please stop teasing her? Dad, she's becoming very funny. I mean, she keeps hearing noises that nobody else hears. I don't care about that. Just take it easy with her, do you understand? (Mrs. Wood) Two eggs? Ben, you must stop making these nightly raids on the ice-box. - What? - Well.. Yesterday, I hard boiled half a dozen eggs for the girl's lunches and now there are only two left, you ate four. Honey. I haven't touched the eggs. Oh, uh, Duane must've been here last night, huh? Mother, he didn't eat those eggs. You're always blaming the missing food on Duane. It's not that, I mean.. I mean... (Althea) I just don't think daddy will.. U-uh, i-it's a matter of planning. I just don't think daddy will admit it. Look, what is with the boil.. I haven't seen a boiled egg in this house. What're you talking about? We've all seen Duane eat. Look, I must have miscounted. You know, Duane's in and out of here so often sometimes I wonder, if it's love or hunger that brings him around. Well, it's certainly not you. Duane's a very nice young man. I like him very much. He's not so nice when he talks about that Wilby boy. Gives me the shakes. [whistling] [intense music] [engine revving] [music continues] [music continues] [car door shuts] - Mother! - Mm-hm. - Mother? - I'm here. Somebody tried to open my diary. What? Somebody tried to open my diary. Don't get me involved. You think I tried to get into your diary? I didn't say that. I said "Somebody." - That's all I said. Well.. - But you mean me. Well, Ellen, I'm not interested in your damn diary! [indistinct chatter] (Mrs. Wood) That's enough! A little less tantrum and a little more fact. There has to be an explanation. Well, I wouldn't touch it. Well, if you didn't touch it, who did? Mom... I said no more screaming! Maybe we do have a ghost. What was that? - What? - Did you hear something? No. [clears throat] Maybe this house is getting to me too. Do you suppose all children Bab's age are that emotional? Well, Babs is famous for her pranks. Mm, maybe this wasn't a prank it was much too sly for that. I mean, if Babs wanted to know something all she would've had done was ask Ellen. That's what I don't understand, it's all so... Honey, look, we've had more than our share of these sibling calamities, uh.. They always seem to work themselves out. I'm sure by the time we get back from the trip we'll have nothing but everlasting peace. Well, I hope so. Well, don't worry about a thing, we'll take care of everything. I'll call you when I know where we're staying. I hate not having a reservation. Have a great weekend. We'll be back late Sunday night. [car honking] Oh! Your restless father. See you later, Babs, I'll be at Judy's till 6:00. Okay, bye! [intense music] [whistling] Anyone home? Hello! [telephone ringing] Hello? - Hi, darling, it's me. - Oh, hi, mom. Just checking in before dark we got another 100 miles to go. Just enjoy yourself and quit worrying about us. We're gonna be staying at the Sea Side Inn and I won't call again. We'll be back tomorrow night, late. Okay, have a good trip, and don't worry. - Bye darling. Love you. - Goodbye, mom. [intense music] [screaming] No, don't yell! [whimpering] Promise me you won't yell. - Not one more sound or I'll... - You'll kill me? No, I never killed anyone. I'm not that kind of person. If my father catches you, he'll... (Ronald) He won't be home till Sunday night. How did you know? I'm Prince Norbert, ruler of Atranta. I know everything. You.. You did that? Why? To please the princess. Atranta's a beautiful place. You see, Princess Fenseta.. ...falls in love with Prince Norbert. Norbert's a fugitive from the land of tyrants. Y-you.. You're Ronald Wilby. Aren't you? I said my name is Norbert. Now, your family has been spending too much time with the evil duke. I want you to come with me. Where? To Atranta. Oh, please.. [screaming] [intense music] [screaming] Mrs. Schumacher! Mrs. Schumacher! [music continues] Operator! [whistling] Princess. [doorknob rattles] [intense music] [whistling] [whistling] [screaming] (doll) Mama. Mama. Mama. (doll) Mama. Mama. Mama. [breathing heavily] [doorknob rattling] Let me out! [music continues] Babs? Babs? Excuse me a second. Babs, I'm home! (Ellen) Duane? Yes? Duane, she's gone. What? Babs, she ran away. I found this note in her type-writer. "Dear, everybody, nobody trusts me "and I can't stand it anymore. "I'm going away for a while. Don't worry. Babs." Well, I guess she did break into your diary. Why would she run away? Duane, she didn't run away. She was probably just too embarrassed to admit it. She's never that embarrassed. She's always the first one to talk about anything. Even if she's wrong. Well, then I think we should call the police. [intense music] The evil duke is spoiling everything. [intense music] [music continues] (Babs) Let me out. Someone. Please, let me out. [panting] Well, the place sure looks nice. Heh. Real dreary it was when Mrs. Wilby lived here. I get the feeling you're gonna tell us there's nothing to worry about. Look, she stood up a date with Jimmy Carter. Not even a call. Well, you all agree she was upset about the diary. I think someone forced her to write that note. And then they took her away. I have chased, maybe 200 girls who left home on their own free will. Well, then, why didn't she take any clothes or money? There's no rhyme or reason. Usually you'll find out when they return. Or it's something as ridiculous as the diary. When are your parents returning? Tomorrow night. They went up to the coast. They said they'd call and let us know when they're coming home. Okay, just have them give me a call, will you? - Aren't you gonna... - I think.. That a good night's rest will settle everyone's mind. And she'll probably be back before morning... What if she has been kidnapped? We're talkin' about a capital offence. We can't search every house on [indistinct] County without something to go on. That letter is not gonna do it. [intense music] [whistling] [clinking] [intense music] [indistinct chatter on TV] - Who's hungry? - I am. Do you wanna go get some hamburgers? - I'll go get 'em. - Uh, no, that's okay. Um, you stay here. - I'll go. - No, Duane. You wanna watch the game. Althea and I'll go. Are you sure? May I please have the car keys? I like mine rare with onion rings. - We'll be back in a while. - Thanks. [indistinct chatter on TV] (man on TV) Brock. Brock at the right side of the key. Brock looking for a shot.. ...and a 20-foot jumper and he hit.. [creaks] And here is the shot.. And it is good! It's a free.. Oh, it's a foul on the play.. Here comes Tex. Hopkins to Kelly. Feeding it into McBride. McBride on the right side. The big guy Mark right at the center on top of the key. Passed over to Ray, Ray sending a pick now as he gives off on the give and go to Kelly. Kelly shoots and hits the 15-footer! Ray to Helms, Helms to Gros And they're looking for a shot now. They wanna get the good percentage shot. That's what they're looking for, the coaches are set to see Tex Tags have a very tough defense so don't take any cheap shots making sure he's got a good one. [clanking] [engine revving] (Althea) Duane, we're back. (man on TV) Forty. Very close ball game.. [whistling] Brock to McBride, McBride passing it into the middle to Ray, Ray trying to work in for a shot and he slam dunks it! And so, the margin is five points.. He's disappeared, just like Babs. Now, tell us what you're gonna do. No calls? Not unless someone called while we were out. Well, we have a few prints. We'll have a confirmation by morning. What if it is Ronald Wilby? There's no reason for him to come back here with his mother dead. Maybe he never left. Ronald Wilby? He'd be picked up in an hour if anyone saw him. Wouldn't you be more comfortable if you spent the night at a hotel? No. Althea, he'll get in like the last time. Not if you don't open the door. - We'll stay. - Look.. We'll lock every door and window in the house. You'll be absolutely safe as long as you stay inside. We won't take our eyes off the place. Girls, you don't have to stay. If anyone is watching, I want him to think that he can get right back into the house. Like he did before. [intense music] You're an intruder in Atranta. Soon, I will banish you. [muffled screaming] What was that? [whispering] I don't know. (Ellen) Althea, wait. [intense music] [no audio] [intense music] [both screaming] [crashing] [both screaming] [siren blaring] Mother! [intense music] Mother! [indistinct radio chatter] [door shuts] [engine revving] - Oh! Oh, my God! - Babs! Oh, God! - I was so worried about you. - Are you okay? [indistinct chatter] [intense music] (Babs) I know. [instrumental music] [music continues]
