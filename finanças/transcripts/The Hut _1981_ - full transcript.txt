Go back! This is my village! Don't you dare think about putting on a guk here! Go back! I said go back! This is my village! Go back! They must've called shamans from all over the country. Is Young Master that gravely ill? How is he? Mother... Please cure my son's illness. We have to try everything so that we have no regrets. Wife... What's happening to Seongmin? My poor son! Do whatever you need to do. Please cure my grandson's iliness. Please make him better. Please... Please go to the guest room. This way. This way please. Those vixens! You've got your pockets full! You even brought along drummers with you! Look at these shrews! Just how much did you pocket? How dare you perform a guk when I'm the village shaman? Putting on a show are you? Everyone is here. Let's see. This shaman is from Yecheon. This one is from Gyeonggi. This one is a male shaman. What do we have here? This one is from Jeolla. This one is from Gyeongsang. You're here, thinking this house is some kind shrine? A ghost who starved to death. Gorge yourself and begone! A ghost who died hanging. Gorge yourself and begone! Oh my grandson... We've prepared a feast for you all. Gorge yourself and begone! Begone! Begone, you evil spirit! He will dance on the blade of the hay cutter. Where do you think you are? Begone, you ghost! Gorge yourself and begone! How dare you! Begone, you evil ghost! Begone! What the hell is that? My grandson! My grandson! It's a snake! Get this snake away! What are you doing? Get the snake away from here! You can't just leave! What about my grandson? You can't go. But I have to go. Go if you must, but tell us why. An evil spirit with a grudge is haunting this place. What do you mean? I can't handle the spirit on my own. Whose spirit is it then? I won't know whose it is until I perform a guk. Then all the reasons why you must do it. But my life will be at... I'll pay you 50 more sacks of rice. Please. You're the only one we trust. I beg you. Then send all the other shamans away. They are all useless. All right. Done! Listen here! Get on the boat! Talk about bad luck! Hurry! It's very strange. Something is not right. That Okhwa will bring down this family! Let's go. Why stay here another minute? The Blue Guardian in the east, the Red Guardian in the south, The White Guardian in the west, and the Black Guardian in the north. The Golden Guardian in the center. All the guardians look upon us and grant us our wish. Bless the parents with life like that of a phoenix on the heavenly paulownia tree. And bless the descendents with fame and wealth. May they be blessed to live many centuries. Let this year's fortune be filled with blessings, as the gate of winter closes and the gate of spring opens. May the body be light and swift as if dressed in new garments. Let peace and harmony be with this house Like wine that is pure or pearl on a jade plate. Let water be clear in the day... A sword in the right hand, a fire in the left hand. Here is the God of Sword. There is the God of Sword. Who are you? How dare you hide here? Begone, you ghost! This is not the place for you! Begone, you ghost! Begone, you ghost! The God of the Heavenly Realm and the God of the Underworld. The Mountain God in the hills, and the Dragon God in the water. The gods are everywhere we look. We, the black-haired mortals, are born to live and die. How dare you come here? Begone, you ghost! Begone, you ghost! Begone! This isn't the place for you! Begone! Begone now! Begone! Begone! Begone! Begone! Begone! Begone! Please say it. Please give me an order. I'll follow. Look upon me with pity and give me an instruction. Where is it? Where is it? Here? If it's not here, where is it? Yes, it's right here. There's a bottle! There's a bottle! -How could it be here... - Mother! A ghost came out from that bottle. That's what they say. What kind of ghost was in that bottle? Old Madam fainted because of it, so the bottle must mean something. Oh, my goodness... Master Jinsa and Old Madam fainted seeing the bottle. I'll say! That bottle must've something to do with that family. What gibberish is that? This is all because they shunned me! The village shaman! Wait and see. The ghost from the bottle will destroy that family. You say an evil spirit came out from that bottle? But how did it get out? When the bottle broke, the ghost sealed in it must've escaped. That can't be... This is most peculiar. I made sure the bottle was completely sealed. It could've gotten damaged with time. No, I'm sure someone dug it up. We're the only ones who know about Samdol's ghost in the bottle. Who is Samdol? I need to know whose spirit was released from that bottle and what grudge it holds. Son, tell her. She has to know so that she can chase it away or appease it. This is a family matter so I must first discuss it with my uncle tonight. You're right. I understand. Mother, what are we going to do? What are we going to do? Hello, Sir. Hello, Sir. Is your master home? Yes, sir. How could something this bewildering be happening? How are you, Uncle? You say Samdol's ghost came back. Right. How did you know it was his ghost? A powerful shaman called Okhwa found the bottle that we had secretly buried twenty years ago. I see. But strangely, the opening of the bottle was broken. That is bizarre. Bring the bottle. And also that shaman. Yes, sir. Kim! Yes, sir. I had her waiting. Take a seat. Is it true that Samdol's spirit is haunting this house? I don't know whose spirit it is. But it is true a horrid spirit is haunting this house. I see. So? We must find out whose ghost it is and why it has a grudge against your family, and perform the Ogu guk. Is that right? I brought the bottle. How is that earthen jar... Take out the bottle! Yes, sir. It really is the bottle from twenty years ago. The top is broken. Bring it here. Yes, sir. What's the matter? What's going on here? What happened? He's been struck down dead. Kim at Master Jinsa's house was killed by Samdol's ghost. Who is Samdol? He was the village Aut keeper. He was a quiet, reliable, and hardworking man who didn't mind doing odd jobs for other people. Why did he die? That's the strange part. He was a young man when he dropped dead so suddenly. Did people find out why he died? Nobody went to the Autback then. The place was spooky even in broad daylight. Nobody knew what went on inside. Mom, what is the village Aut? Nobody has told you what it is yet. In the old days, people moved the sick or the dead there. Why? Back then, every village had a Aut. Except for the ones who died of old age, all the other dying people were moved there. So that their spirits didn't come back to haunt the village. I heard that the women had babies there. Babies? Why there? The Aut was like a stopping place between this world and the next. It was the place for the beginning and the end of life. That's right. It's vile! That shaman is here again. It's vile! Ptooey! Why is that crazy hag walking around? How dare you snub me? The gods will be furious and curse this village. You just wait and see! Our family has been reputable and respected from long ago. One of our great grandfathers was the Minister of Rites. We've been bestowed with the vermilion gate of chastity. But strangely, the men in our family have always died young. We had so many widows in the family that people called us the house of widows. The widows had to stay chaste to uphold the family reputation. However, it was not easy for those young widows to remain faithful to their dead husbands until they die. What? Is she very sick? Yes, she's burning up. Why is she this sick? Tell mel! She has festering wounds. Festering wounds? She stabbed herself over and over again before the wounds could heal. Oh, the poor thing! If stabbing could help you stay chaste, anyone would be able to do it. How is she now? She's not going to make it. What? She's been unconscious for three days, unable to eat or drink anything. What should we do then? It's better for her to pass away without more suffering. You mean... Take her to the village Autright now. So that her spirit can go to the netherworld. Samdol! Are you here? Samdol! Samdol! Mister Kim! Let's go in. Lay her down over there. Be gentle. She's the daughter-in-law of the Jinsa family. The doctor said she won't last more than three days. Take care of her until then. Yes, sir. We'll get going. Wipe away her sweat often and pray for her soul to reach the heavens. Yes, sir. Who is there? Oh, Madam! What brings you here? Carry her to the room. Yes, ma'am. Good. Come out now. Yes, ma'am. Wait here for a minute. Yes, ma'am. Go into the room. What? Do as I say. Yes, ma'am. Take off your clothes. What? Get undressed and lie down next to her. No, ma'am! I want to do something for her before she dies. But, ma'am... Only a woman who has lost her husband knows how hard it is to stay chaste at such a young age. A woman who dies stabbing herself with a silver dagger will be condemned to wander inferno for eternity So please do this for me. But how can a lowlife like me... Shall T have you killed? Ma'am! I'll have you killed if you refuse. Take off your clothes. Also your trousers. Are you undressed? Yes, ma'am. Then lie down next to her. But, ma'am... Are you going to disobey me? Take her into your arms. Do it! Mister Kim! It's a silk shroud for the lady. Wrap her with this when she dies. Yes, sir. Who are you? You're awake! Who are you? I'm Samdol. Samdol? The Aut keeper. The Aut? Then this must be... Yes, you're at the village Aut. They thought you would die from the infection, so they brought you here. People thought I was going to die? Yes. So I treated you with herbs. I'm sorry. It's a blessing from the heavens. Your wounds have healed and you are recovered. Get away from me! How dare you! I've done something horrible... What do you mean? I didn't want to do it... Old Madam ordered me to do it. She wanted me to put your grudges to rest before you pass away. What? What I thought was not a dream... - Please forgive me. - Leave me! Now! What? She's alive? What do you mean she's alive? Well... I treated her wounds with herbs. The wounds have healed and she is better now. My goodness! Summon the servants! Oh, dear! We thought you were dead but here you are! The heavens blessed you. Heaven blessed you for your kindred heart. Thank heavens, you're alive. Goodbye, madam! Socks... They're her socks. Did you take dinner table there? Your dinner is ready. Where is Young Madam? She must be in the backyard again. Go bring her. Yes, ma'am. Your dinner is ready. Ma'am. Dinner is ready. I have no appetite. I see. Madam! I came to say thank you. There is no need... Good bye, then. Madam! Madam! Madam! Madam! Madam! Madam! Put these on. Give me the ones you're wearing. I'll wash them for you. Madam! People will see us. Hurry. Madam! Madam! Madam! I brought sweets and fruit. They are for you. Madam! Good bye, then. Madam! Madam! What do you want? Madam! What are you doing? Madam! Don't come any closer! No! Madam! Please forgive me! What are you doing? Madam! What did you say? Are you sure? Yes, she is definitely pregnant. Whose child is she carrying? She has been seeing Samdol the Aut keeper. Who's there? Oh, Master Jinsa! Why are you doing this? Go on! Kill him! Why are you trying to kill me? Sir, please spare me! I did nothing bad! I did what Old Madam told me to do! Please don't kill me, sir! I will never do it again! Have mercy, sir! Please don't kill me! I'll never do it again! What's going on? Is it done? Hurry! Let's go over there. Yes, sir. Did you bring her shoes? Yes, sir. Put them near the edge. Throw her over! Let's go. Oh, my dear sister-in-law! Oh, my dear sister-in-law! Oh, my dear sister-in-law! She missed her dead husband so much that she threw herself into the river. Oh, the poor woman! It's better that she followed her husband in death. Right! She will be with husband. The Blue Guardian in the east, the Red Guardian in the south, The White Guardian in the west, the Black Guardian in the north. The Golden Guardian in the center. All the guardians look upon us and grant us our wish. Bless the parents with life like that of a phoenix on the heavenly paulownia tree. And bless the descendents with fame and wealth. May they be blessed to live many centuries. Let this year's fortune be filled with blessings, as the gate of winter closes and the gate of spring opens. May your body be light and swift, as if dressed in new garments. Let peace and harmony be with this house. Like wine that is pure or pearl on a jade plate, Let water be clear in the day and fire be bright at night. Water and fire are pure and flows like silk, or flow like the water of the Han River. We pray the children of this family be mighty like the mountain, immense like the ocean, loyal and faithful to the nation, dutiful to the parents, caring to their siblings, supportive of the clan, and trusting of the friends. Let them be finest in the world. Ordered by Dongfang... Good! Put it in the bottle! You have it! In here! Over here! Over herel! Put it in here! It's over there now! Bring it over here! Good! Hurry up! Is it done? We managed to capture Samdol's spirit. What are we going to do now? Bury it. Bury it somewhere over there. You do it, not the servants. This all happened two decades ago. And we forgot all about it. I understand. Such an aggrieved soul will hold a deep grudge. Then can you make it go away? It's been twenty years, a thing of the past. A big Ogu guk to appease his spirit will make him move on. Tomorrow is the last night of the month, I will do it then so don't worry. All right. Don't spare anything to make this guk into extragavant one. Yes. I will take my leave. Deokswe, are you there? What happened to my lamp? I'll bring it over right now, Ma'am! Stay still! It's not safe here with that hay cutter. So, be quiet! Otherwise, it will cut off your neck! Do as I say! Come here again after the guk tomorrow. If you don't, I will tell everyone about you. There are no such things like ghosts. I know it's all a trick. You're just trying to scam some money. What brings you? I want to ask you something. What is it? I've been having strange dreams. What is it? My body started aching a few days ago and I can't even move well. An old woman in white appears in my dreams and drags me around with her. She must be Mother Goddess. Mother Goddess? You're a fake pretending to be a shaman. Now Mother Goddess wants to make you a real one. Isn't that right? You're a fake! I'm right, aren't I? You're no shaman! I'm right, aren't I? I knew it! Where did you learn all the shaman rituals? From Mohwa. Mohwa? How do you know her? She is my mother. The famous shaman will have an even more famous shaman daughter now that you'll receive the spirit of Mother Goddess. What should I do next? Perform an initiation guk. Will you do it for me? Of course. I'll get to have a shaman daughter. Then I will entrust you with it. Where does Mother Goddess take you at night? To the foot of that mountain. Let's go there, then. Where is it? Where is it? I saw this tree root in my dream. Dig it up! Something's here! Mother Goddess, and the God and the Goddess of Seondo Mountain! Bless her with good fortune and power. Please make Okhwa a powerful shaman! Please make Okhwa a powerful shaman! Mother Goddess, and the God and the Goddess of Seondo Mountain! Bless her with good fortune and power. Please make Okhwa a powerful shaman! Please make Okhwa a powerful shaman! Look! She is the spirit you will serve! Take a good look! We belong to her now! Yes, the goddesses have descended from the mountain. You have sent Okhwa to me. Yes, we will serve you with all our hearts. Yes, the goddesses have descended from the mountain. You have sent Okhwa to me. Yes, we will serve you with all our hearts. Where are the visitors from? They are great guests from Gangnamguk. Let there be a cornucopia of grains, millet, sweet rice, sorghum, and maize. Let every cup overflow with abundance. Will he be cured by this guk? It must. He is the eldest son who even studied in Tokyo. Why would the Aut ghost possess him of all people? I'll say! I beg you with all my heart. My one and only grandson! Here I pray. Look! The evil spirit is still here. Please wake up. It's all nonsense! The hay cutter... I'll rest my head... Give me some money for the road! It's the last trip so make it plenty! It's a snake! -Someone is dead! -That's horrible! -Uncle is dead! -How could that happen? Oh, Mother! What should we do? Mother! Old Madam fell through the floor! Old Madam is dead, hanging on a rope. Begone! Begone! The evil spirit is gone! You're right! It has left this house. Your son will get better now. If you had told me about the story earlier, I could've performed the Ogu guk earlier to stop the tragedy. It's very unfortunate. Where are you going? To the hut. The Aut? The Aut keeper's ghost has left this house, but he has not reached the next world yet. His spirit might linger at the Aut where his body is and prey on your life. If you can come to the Aut and ask for his forgiveness, the spirit will depart from this world. You might find it too below you to do this, so I'll go there to pray on your behalf. Wifel My dear son! Seongmin! Seongmin! Mother! Father! Yes, my son! Seongmin! This isn't a dream, is it? You're well again! The ghost is really gone. She was right. The ghost is gone. Mother, please help me get up. Of course. See! Okhwa really is a powerful shaman. She has saved Seongmin's life. You must go to the Aut as she said and pray the keeper's spirit. You must do it to save your life. Go on! Go to her! Come on. Now! You must! That's how you were saved. It's all thanks to that shaman Okhwa. That's ridiculous. I recovered on my own. That's all. You don't know. Son, that's not... Don't say such a thing! The heavens will punish you for disrespecting Okhwa. You'll get struck by lightning! That won't happen. Don't worry. We live in a modern world. There are no ghosts. We, women respect our parents, love our siblings, honor our relatives with loving hearts. But why are our lives so sad and tragic? Is it such a sin to be born a woman? Please help my poor soul be at rest! I was married to the Park clan. They accused me of adultery and stoned me to death. Then left me to die at this village hut where I met my untimely death. Listen to me... It's all just superstition, Mother. I was the only son of the Lee clan. They abandoned me at the hut for catching the plague and I breathed my last here. I see. I'll pray for your soul to be at peace too. I was [eft to die at this hut where I met my lonely death. I feel your sorrow. I also died unjustly at this hut. It's all because of this hut/ I understand. It's all because of this hut/ Son! We live in a new world, Mother. In Tokyo, they're making huge improvements in science. It's ridiculous to think that a whole family can be killed by a ghost. Son! Do you know where my father is? - I'm not sure. - He was here just now. You wait out here. Yes, sir. Sit over here. Now pray. Why are you touching that horrid hay cutter? Look, Mother. Uncle Gusan loved drinking and he died because he got drunk, fell asleep here when the rope snapped. Oh, Seongmin! Don't say such a thing! What if the ghost returns to haunt you again? Okhwa just chased it away. Grandma fell through here? Strange... It's designed to hold the weight. Someone tampered with it so that it would fall through. And look at the noose here. It was tied big enough for a head to fit through. I'm not sure. Dig that spot. A snake came out from here? Right. Look, Mother. Someone hid a snake there and pulled this string to release it. Great-uncle, Uncle, Grandma, and Mister Kim were all killed by the traps set up by someone. Don't say that! Okhwa will strike you dead! Where did you find this shaman called Okhwa? Kim went to Yecheon to fetch a shaman named Mohwa. But they said that Okhwa was even more powerful, so she came instead. Is that right? So don't be disrespectful of her. It's wrong to be so ungrateful. By the way, where is father? He's still not back. I'm not sure. Oh, he must've gone to the village Aut. The Aut? Yes. For what? After saving your life, Okhwa said that he should pray to the dead spirits at the Aut to prevent misfortune. He must've gone there. No! He will be killed! This is Samdol's corpse! How can this be? Who are you really? I'm the daughter of the man you killed! What? Master Jinsa will die! Okhwa will kill him! The man had a wife before he became the Aut keeper. The wife became a shaman and left for the big town. There she had me and became the famous shaman called Mohwa. My mother told me that Samdol was my father. I came to see him and found out he was wrongfully killed by your family and decided to seek revenge. So I disguised myself as a shaman and entered your house. I will now take my revenge. No, Okhwa... Men! Yes, sirl Ok... Okhwa, please forgive me. Take out the corpse. Everyone, head to the village Aut! Jinsa, prepare to die. I'm sorry. Men! No, Okhwa! Father! I spared the life of our enemy. All the creations of this world, hear our prayer. We are born into this world with the bones of our fathers and the flesh of our mothers. By the third month, blood is formed, and by the sixth month, our bodies developed. After ten months, we are born into this world. Worried that we might be cold in winter and hot in summer, our parents fretted as they raised us as prescious as a mountain of gold. When we were young, we couldn't repay the debt of gratitude. Our younger days are gone and sadly our hair has grayed. Our life will fade away like the morning dew. Yesterday we were in perfect health, but today we moan and groan from aches. Who knew the netherworld Is right outside the gate? If I had known my youth would be over so early, I would've done my best to my parents. The End Translation by Alyssa Kim
