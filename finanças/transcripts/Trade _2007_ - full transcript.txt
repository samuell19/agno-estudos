I met her mother just after i was married To patty my wife, and i was a happely married man And then i met elenore, and everything changed. She was... Oh she was so... wild and alive. I don't know what i was expecting but i was ready to give up everything. My marrige everything, so stupid! Stupid... And then she met this other guy and... He was everything i wasn't, i mean... she found him exiting... and alive... Anyway and then she told to me, that she was pregnant with his child. And a... That kind of did it, i left and a... went back to patty Did patty take you back? Yeap. Go figure. That would never happen in mexico. Just a few days ago i get a knock at my door from a couble of officers and they told me that elenore has died. From an overdose. And they found this letter in her apartment with my name on it. That she's written 10 years before, but never sent. And she says she needs money, and that karla is my daughter. Which i always... wonderd about. You didn't know she had a daughter did you? I did. We had our ups and downs years We helped her out all we could, but she's always in trouble And the daughter? In foster homes mostley, but i always managed to get her back. After you. She went over the border to juarez about ten years ago. Probably at the time when she wrote you that letter. Was her daughter with her? We have no idea. We do know, that she got back here two years later, The girl was gone And the house was still a mess. Did you... Did you ask her what happend to the daughter. She told us that she left her with her daddy. We didn't know what kind of daddy she was talking about? We couldn't proof anything, what are you talking about? We think, she sold the girl i don't know, but with junkies that happends She sold her. If i... if i gotten that letter 10 years before, everythingl would be different. Me and patty always wanted a child. She's pretty, ain't she? Yes, she has beautiful eyes. Green.. Like her mothers. So, that's what you where doing in the house in juarez.
