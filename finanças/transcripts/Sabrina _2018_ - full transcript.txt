-What's wrong? -Madam. What's wrong? Andini! -Miss Laras? -Yes? I'm Raynard, a friend of Bagas. I usually set up the tools when he's handling his cases. He's moved to another city. Yes. I called Bagas earlier. He couldn't help me. He's the one who told me to meet you. What's the matter? I'm dealing with a case, but this one is very hard. I need someone whose power is greater than mine. What's the case? This man's wife experienced a strange phenomenon three days ago. After that day, she got sick. She couldn't get out of bed. The doctor couldn't figure out what got her sick. And when her husband got back from work, he saw that her appearance had changed. She's been possessed by a highly negative energy. An evil spirit? Yes. I'm still trying to find out who this spirit is. But from what I've seen, it clearly wants to control a human's body and live inside it. I've tried removing the spirit using various methods, but it's very difficult. I've used all of my tools and methods. -Mr. Raynard. -Yes. -This is Laras. -Come in. Come in. This way. It's this room. What's your wife's name? Andini. No one comes in until we're done. SCHOOL BUS Happy birthday. I hope that you'll always be happy and that all of your dreams come true. Happy birthday, dear. Happy birthday, dear. I wish you'll have a long life, become even prettier, and be loved by a lot of people. Oh, right! I have a present for you. -Me too! -So, who wants to go first? Come on, let's get the presents. Come on. Uncle Aiden's first, or Aunt Maira's? This is from me. So, which one's first? It's the iPad that you've always wanted! -Thank you, uncle. -You're welcome, dear. Now, look. What did you get from Aunt Maira? Open it. So pretty! This is your fashion brand, right? This is Aunt Maira's brand, Kayla Kids. For children. It'll look really pretty on you. This... Try it. I made it just for you. So, no one can copy you. What should you say to your aunt? Thank you. Vanya. Come here, dear. Vanya, Aunt Maira bought a cake for you. Let's blow out the candles first. She still needs time. I also have something for you. Can I open them now? Open your eyes now. Sabrina? I couldn't wait to give this to you. This is my second edition of Sabrina. I know that your late daughter, Kayla, really liked the first edition of Sabrina. So, I looked for the maker, bought the rights, and made this second edition just for you. As a token of my love to you. And this one is special. This is the big version. The only one in this world for you. I hope you can play with Vanya and it could bring you two closer. But it's definitely hard for her, accepting the fact that her parents are gone. Especially at such a young age. Plus, she has to live with a stranger like me. I understand. And I understand how she feels, too. But, that's life. We have to pray a lot, and be patient. Thank you, dear. GLOBAL MANDIRI SCHOOL Vanya. -Vanya. -Yeah? Ditho has a new game. -Let's check it out. -Let's go. What game is that? It's called Charlie, Charlie. He was taught by his brother. We can ask anything to anyone who's already dead. If our question is answered, that pencil will move by itself. -Really? -Yeah. Charlie, Charlie. Can my grandma come here? Now, you guys believe me, right? -Who wants to ask her? -I do. Charlie, ask Ditho's grandma. Is Ditho naughty? Charlie, is Ditho a scaredy cat? -Charlie, does Ditho wet his bed at night? -No! Enough! The game is over! -Ditho wets his bed. -Ditho wets his bed. -He wets his bed. -My bed stays dry! -Ditho wets his bed. -Enough! -Ditho wets his bed. -Go away! -Ditho wets his bed. -Ditho wets his bed. -Ditho wets his bed. -Ditho wets his bed. Charlie, Charlie, we'll end this game here. Tell Grandma that we're done playing. What are you doing? We have to pray first. So the entity that we've called can go back to its realm in peace. Entity? Yeah. My brother said, dead people and spirits are called entities. So your grandma really did come? -Yes. -Did you see her? -I did. -How? Using an entity detector app. If an entity is present, it will blink in green. And the entity can be seen there. Can I borrow it? Sure. Here. I still have one at home. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Charlie, Charlie, can we play? Charlie, Charlie, can we play? Charlie, Charlie, can we play? Charlie, Charlie, can we play? Charlie. Can my mom come here? My mom is okay, right? I miss you, Mom. I really miss you. Do you miss me? Mom, can I see you? Can I meet you? Vanya! It's late, why aren't you asleep? There's been a short circuit, so I'm bringing a flashlight here. What are you playing this late? Entity detector? Ditho said we can see dead people with this. Who do you want to see? Do you miss someone? I want to see my mom again. Dear, I, too, have lost a child once. When I miss Kayla, I just pray for her. I have something for you. Wait in your room. Back then, Kayla had a favorite doll. Its name was Sabrina. When Kayla hugged Sabrina, her fear and sadness would go away. Because they were friends. And now, this special Sabrina doll made by Uncle Aiden can be your friend. So, when you feel sad or when you miss someone, try hugging this doll. You'll feel much calmer. Now, Sabrina is your friend. Thank you. You're welcome, dear. Now get some sleep, okay? Auntie, can you turn on the music box? Of course, dear. Now sleep, okay? Has the sales report for the Sabrina doll come out yet? And what's the result? Surpassed the target? This is excellent. Start the preparation for the second batch immediately then. Vanya, come down, dear. You'll be late for the playdate. Valerie is already waiting. Vanya! Dear, you know what? The Sabrina doll is a hit in this week's sales. Amazing. It's a big step up, you know? Congratulations, dear. And you know what? It did much better than the first edition. This is an achievement for me. Your parents would be so proud of you. I hope so. Vanya. Vanya. Beautiful like I said, right? Aunt Maira is good at picking things for you, right? I'll make more for you. Okay, go on. -You'll be late. -Auntie. I'm putting Sabrina in your care. When I get back home, I want to play with her again. Of course. Now, go on already. -Let's go. We're off. -Yeah. Wait, Uncle. Let's go. Bye, Auntie. Miss Nur, why did you move Sabrina? It really surprised me. How annoying. -Hello, dear. -Hi. How's the office? You know, today I got a Sabrina export deal to another country. -Seriously? -Yeah. Congrats, dear. -Are you hungry? -I'm starving. I cooked something special for you. DITHO: HI VANYA. HAVE YOU MET AN ENTITY YET? NOT YET. LAME. KEEP TRYING. Help! Vanya? Help! -Vanya! -Help! -Vanya! -Help! Vanya, dear, what are you doing here? Someone dragged me, Uncle. Who? There's nobody here. You must be spending too much time playing with your iPad. Daydreaming and imagining until you're affected. -What were you playing? -It's nothing. It's time for dinner. I'll hold on to this iPad. You remember, don't you? We have a deal about when you can play with it. Right? Let's go. Mom? Thank you for coming. I missed you. My daughter. It's time to sleep. Don't be sad. Now, I'll never leave you again. Vanya. Wake up. It's already noon. After taking a bath, we'll have breakfast. Yes, Auntie. Isn't it good? If Sabrina wears these clothes, she'll look like me. Pink or blue? Thank you. Miss Nur, please get me that jam over there. Morning, dear. Morning, dear. How wonderful. Where's Vanya? She's still in her room. Vanya, stop playing. Let's have breakfast already. Vanya? Let me just check upstairs. Vanya? Vanya. Vanya. Vanya? WESLY AND PARTNERS LAW FIRM WILL I, BRAMANTYO KEV, AS THE OWNER OF KEV TOYS, BEQUEATH THE COMPANY TO MY SONS, ARKA AND AIDEN KEV Vanya, you surprised me! What are you doing here? Come out. Why are you playing here? It's dangerous. Besides, you're really rowdy. Yeah, because the two of us are playing. You're joking. Can Sabrina even play tag? I'm playing with my mom. Dear, your mom is in heaven. But the Charlie, Charlie game worked. Mom came to accompany me, Auntie. Yes, ma'am. I understand. The problem is, it has really disturbed Vanya. Also, that game is not good for your son either. I'm just asking you to tell Ditho not to play that game with Vanya again. I hope you could understand. Ditho's just helping me to meet my mom. Why is Uncle stopping me from playing it? His intention is good, Vanya. Your uncle and I know that you haven't accepted your mom's death, right? But you can't stay like this forever. Your uncle and I are not asking you to forget your mom. No. Absolutely not. Your mom will always be in your heart forever. But if you keep being like this, you'll suffer the consequences. You won't be able to focus at school, you'll always feel sad, and you won't be able to play with your friends. Look. If you need a friend to share stories with, and to stay with you while you're studying or playing, you can always come to me. I really love you. Uncle Aiden and I will always be there for you. We're a family. Vanya, where are you going? To meet my mom. I feel bad for her for acting like this. I understand. Me too, I also feel bad for her. Okay. I'll take some time off from work, and so will you. Vanya needs a new atmosphere. We'll go on a vacation. -Is it deep enough? -No. No? Now you're just playing with me. Yeah. It's so we can put more shells in. -Got it. -Uncle, the hole inside has to be bigger, okay? Okay. Auntie, now we have to find the shells. -Come on. -Let's go. -Bye. -Oh, yeah. Uncle, if you're done digging, help us find the shells, okay? All right. Bye. Gosh. You have a lot of shells, Vanya. I lost. Of course. It's me we're talking about. Auntie, I want to look for shells over there. Maybe I'll find even more. If I find more than you, you have to sleep with me tonight, okay? Okay, auntie. Be careful, dear. What? I'm looking for shells, Mom. Look. That's a lot of shells, right? Mom, would you help me look for shells? Who are you talking to, Vanya? My mom. Vanya. It's just the two of us here. There's three of us. She's behind you. Do you miss your mom? I've told you. If you miss her, you can pray for her, right? Mom is waiting near the hole. The one in the hole is Uncle Aiden. No, Auntie. That's it. I'm going to look for more shells. To give to my mom over there. Wait here, okay? I need to talk to Uncle Aiden. Aiden! Help! Help! Aiden! Maira! Maira! Maira! Maira! Maira. How did you get in there? Someone dragged me. Someone dragged me. Who? I don't know but someone dragged me. Andini? Maira! Maira. Maira. It's me. Calm down. It's me. Who did this to you? -Who? -Andini. Andini. Andini. You have to see it for yourself. You have to see it. What are you seeing? Maira, are you okay? -Lock the door. -Okay. Vanya, wake up, dear. Wake up. Uncle, Auntie, what's wrong? What's that? What was that? Where did you get that necklace? From Miss Laras. She gave it to me as a precaution. We have to call her again. Ask for her help. BANDUNG Excuse me, is Miss Laras here? Oh, wait. Maira. Miss Laras. -Aiden. -How are you, Miss Laras? I'm good. This is Raynard, my husband. Raynard. Sorry I didn't invite you to our wedding. Everything happened so fast. How are you? I haven't heard from you since your wedding. I'm good. Sorry for not keeping in touch. A lot has happened after we got married. Let's talk inside. Please. How can we help you, Maira? So, it's about Vanya, Aiden's niece, who we've considered as our own. She still can't accept her mother's death. She secretly played the Charlie, Charlie game to communicate with her mom. After that incident, she started acting weird. She feels physically close to her mom. At first, Aiden and I didn't believe it. But we saw it with our own eyes. -What did it look like? -Her mom. It has two faces. The front side is her mother, and the back side is a terrifying face. What Vanya did is fatal. Those who are dead should be left in peace. Those who have left should never be called back. Because if we call something that's been gone for a long time, and then they come, it usually invites something negative. I'll help you, Maira. But first, I need to talk to Vanya. Vanya, dear. Come here. We have guests. Go on, say hello. I'm Miss Laras. This is Mr. Raynard. Friends of Uncle Aiden and Aunt Maira? That's right. Uncle Aiden and Aunt Maira invited me here to play with you. Play? Play what? Charlie, Charlie to talk to your mom. This has to be done to know whether the one who's coming is really her mother or not. Yes, Miss Laras, let's play. -What's your mom's name? -Andini. Do you have a picture of her? -Can I see it? -Of course. Let's go. Here. MOM Vanya, please ask three questions that could only be answered by you and your mom later. Can you do that? Usually, if there's a different entity, one of the answers would be wrong. Let's start. Charlie, Charlie, can we play? Try again. Charlie, Charlie, can we play? Mom is here. I want to ask among the fairy tale princesses, is Snow White my favorite? My favorite princess is Cinderella. Two more questions. Back then, before I went to sleep, you always whispered to me, hoping that I'd have good dreams. Isn't that right, Mom? When I didn't want to eat, you always said to me that I wouldn't grow bigger. Yes or no, Mom? She always said that I shouldn't get sick. Now, go play in your room, okay? I want to talk to your mom. What do you want to play, Miss Vanya? The one where we cut and glue some papers. I know. You want to make a star, don't you? No. Flower. Come on. All of the answers were correct. It's Andini. We'll send her back. Andini, I'll help you return to your peaceful realm. Are you willing to let me help you? Andini, forgive Vanya because her ignorance called you here. I'll help send you home. Are you willing to? Andini, do you hear me? I will help send you home. Miss Vanya. Don't go too far from me. Miss Vanya. Miss Vanya. Andini wouldn't go home. Let's force her to go back. The Almighty who rules the universe and creates life. Miss Vanya. Don't go too far from me. Miss Vanya, I've been looking for you. Open the crossing so Andini can go back. To the Almighty who rules the universe, the creator of our dimension and theirs. The guard between two worlds, open the crossing door so Andini can go back. She's called here, we'll help her to go back. Open the crossing door so that Andini can go back. Vanya! Vanya! What happened to you? Vanya! Vanya! Are you okay, Laras? Aiden! Aiden! Laras! Laras! -Vanya. -Laras. In the name of God, nothing could stand in His way. His greatness can't be degraded and beaten! We seek refuge in the All-Hearing and All-Knowing from all cursed evil. Ruler of heaven, earth, and all in between. Give me your power to remove what doesn't belong in this body! There will be no power but Your help! Let go! It's on its way out. Let go! There will be no power but Your help! There will be no power but Your help! There will be no power but Your help! There will be no power but Your help! -Vanya! -Vanya! Vanya! Vanya. Vanya? -Vanya? -Dear? Vanya, wake up, Dear. Vanya. Vanya, wake up. Vanya. Dear? Come, slowly. Are you okay, dear? Mom. Baghiah. Let's go outside! Aiden! -Sabrina! -Let me get her. -Aiden, Miss Nur! -Yeah. Miss Nur! -She's still alive. -Let's bring her. The Sabrina doll. SURYA HOSPITAL The situation is much worse than we thought. The entity that has been staying with you is not Andini. It was a demon's child that disguised itself as her. And it's better for you to see it for yourself. We'll begin the commission ritual. Miss Laras will tell you telepathically. This happened a year ago. What's your wife's name? Andini. No one comes in until we're done. Andini? In the name of the Almighty God who couldn't be beaten. Andini, you're the true owner of your body, not anything else. Not the evil spirit that's controlling you. I'm not a spirit. I'm different. Did you see? Are you scared? I'm Baghiah. One of the demon's children in the spirit realm. And you can't drive me out. Laras. Laras. Andini! Stop sounding like Andini. Andini is gone. She's dead! You killed her from the inside. You took her soul. Andini! Andini! Hey, demon's child. Do you see this? It's a piece of yellow bamboo wrapped in Moringa leaves. With these two elements, the archipelago ancestors and yours made a sacred vow to not disturb each other. Andini! And whoever broke it will be destroyed! Andini! Andini! -Don't come in, Mr. Arka! -Andini! Mr. Arka! We seek refuge from the devil! Whether it's a human or a spirit. We seek refuge from the evil of its followers and the evil of all that rebel! Nothing is entitled to control this human body. Nothing is entitled to control this human body. There will be no power but Your help, the ruler of heaven and earth. There will be no power but Your help, the ruler of heaven and earth. There will be no power but Your help, the ruler of heaven and earth. There will be no power but Your help, the ruler of heaven and earth. It's gone. If the demon has stayed in a person's body for more than two days, the soul inside will die. Baghiah means wrongdoing, the evil. We never knew how it approached Andini and took control of her body. But its old grudge from failing to control Andini's body makes it want to return now. When we found out that Vanya's mom is the same Andini, we both got suspicious that this has to do with Baghiah. But we kept hoping that it was wrong. We hoped it was really Andini because all of Vanya's questions were answered correctly. And at that time, I couldn't sense Baghiah's energy at all. It will look for any means to come back to this world. It's cunning. If Vanya calls for Andini, it will appear as Andini. Baiting Vanya, attracting her attention, disturbing all of you, so you will come to us. For what? To meet Laras and get revenge. This is Baghiah's big plan because back then, I stopped it from controlling Andini's body. Now it's back to control another human body so it can live as a human, just like it wanted. And... to kill me. At least for a while, I beg you do not return to that house. I've sealed that entity inside it. And you have to find another house. If you return to that house, it will be very dangerous. I promise to solve this case with Laras thoroughly. We don't have much time. We don't know how long that lock can hold Baghiah inside. Laras? I don't think I can face this demon. Its power is much stronger than before. And it wouldn't just harm me. It could harm you too. Laras, you have to remember. Humans are much nobler than the demon and all of its descendants. And you were given an amazing gift from God to be in between the two worlds, Laras. You're stronger than the fear that that demon had inflicted upon you. Our meeting was not a coincidence. The Almighty had arranged it. Together, we're united and stronger in helping those in need. We have the same vision, mission, and heart. Our faith and belief in the Lord is much stronger than that demon. Laras, we can defeat any demon together. But we can't use the same method and tools. We need something out of the ordinary. I've prepared something for you. The day after we met Baghiah, I did tirakat and asked for guidance. I also asked for the Creator's protection to defend myself in case another demon comes. And I went to an inland in the south of Java to find an heirloom which was hidden by the demon itself because it knew that it could be defeated with this heirloom. Getting rid of it is not enough because it will certainly come back. We have to destroy it forever. Use this heirloom when Baghiah shows its true form. Not when it's in Andini's body. Vanya, we're safe now. You don't have to be scared anymore. Miss Laras and Mr. Raynard will help us. Okay? After we arrive at your grandparents', we can walk around the factory. You will like it. There are lots of dolls and toys there. Let's put your picture here, too. Now you're a part of Kev's big family. The wife of the owner of Kev Toys. Thank you. I know that Baghiah is good at hiding its existence. But, I'm sure it's not here this time. No way. He has controlled this house. Choosing this house to settle in and using it as a stepping stone to lure us here. The energy did come from here initially, but now it's gone. It must be using something here as its medium. This house is just a shell. And that thing surely has gotten out before you locked this place. -The Sabrina doll! -The Sabrina doll! Is it okay if we go inside, dear? It's okay. Today's a day off, so there are no workers. I also want to tell you that you can't make any phone calls inside. We did that on purpose so the workers can focus. Okay. I haven't been here for so long. I've already forgotten. It was when your grandparents were still here. -Yeah. -Let's go over there. -Vanya, be careful. -Okay. Uncle, where's the light? Is this a sewing room? Yes, this is the room for sewing, finishing dolls, making the dresses, attaching the legs, eyes, and everything else. Can I try sewing? Do you want to try sewing? I'll prepare it first. But, let Aunt Maira teach you how to sew. Because I can't do it. Okay, then I'm going to the bathroom first. Okay. Want me to take you? -I'll take her. -Okay. Sorry, the number you're calling is outside the service area. They can't be reached. I'll wait here, okay? Okay, Auntie. Auntie, turns out it's locked. Vanya, come here. Aiden! Aiden, it's here! We have to get out! Hurry! Let's go! Maira! Aunt Maira! Maira! Vanya, go get some help. Maira! Sorry, can I help you? -Miss Laras! -Vanya! Where's Aunt Maira and Uncle Aiden? Inside. Aunt Maira is trapped. That demon is here! Please look after her. Don't go in. It's dangerous. -Maira! -Maira! -Aiden! -Aiden! -Maira! -Maira! Maira! -Maira? -Maira's inside! Aiden, when I say smash, smash it hard! God, everything that's in heaven and on earth is Yours! There will be no power but Yours! Laras. Laras. Can't wait. To kill. You. Die. Die! -Maira! -Maira! Maira! Die! Laras, run! Raynard! You'll be dead on the spot. Laras. Laras! Die! There will be no power but Your help. As long as you're terrified, I won't back down. Won't back down! Die! Die. Laras. Die. Raynard. Laras! Mr. Raynard. Where's Maira? They're gone. Come on. Nothing else should be worshipped but You, the Eternal. We seek refuge in You from the evil of demons and its children. Open the door! Laras, you're pathetic. Then. Now. You. Will. Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Go, die! Laras! Die! Die! Get it, Laras. You can do it! Get it, Laras. Get it. You can do it, Laras. Laras, get it. We can do it. We can! We can defeat this demon together! Get it, Laras! In the name of God whose force and power is the greatest. You could get me out of this body. But not from any other bodies. No. You're not entitled to any human's body! When I first came into this world, I possessed Andini's body. Because someone called me. Someone invited me. I have the right to claim my reward. My reward! This is excellent, Arka. Your toys are selling really well. -Congratulations. -Thanks, Dad. This is not good enough, Aiden. Try making another one. A toy that could be sold according to our target. Yours is still far below the average. Look at Arka. What are you going to make next? Here. I already made the sample. -Dad. -Yes, Aiden? This is my newest design. This won't work, Aiden. This is the eighth time you rejected my design. You never even once rejected Arka's design. Aiden, I know which one will waste funds and which one will get it back and make a profit. Aiden, Mom and Dad got into an accident! Let's go! According to this will, "I hereby state that the company's shares of PT Kev Toys with the amount of, one, 60 percent to Arka Kev, son of Bramantyo Kev. Two, 40 percent to Aiden Kev, son of Bramantyo Kev." So you want your brother to get out of your way of becoming the only heir? Yes. You want him sick or dead? For other matters, you could probably pay with money. But your money is useless for this supernatural being which will carry out this mission. Then, what can you give in return? What does it ask for? It wants a human body. And to live in the human world. What does that mean? Taking your brother's life and living inside his body. The supernatural. You, who like cigarettes. You're one of the spirits. I'll give you anything you want! We'll open a passage for you to go inside of Arka Kev, son of Bramantyo Kev's body. You may take his soul from the inside and control his body. It's hard. Arka is hard to possess. But I have another body to use. To execute your plan successfully. We will use his wife's body. His wife? For what? To possess it. Take her soul, then control her body and live in it. But my target is not his wife. But with her body, you will achieve your goal. The goal is achieved. Arka is dead. The only heir. But something got in my way of claiming my pay. Of getting my reward. We seek refuge in You from any evil that is seen or hidden. From any evil at night or noon. Laras! We seek refuge in You from any evil that is seen or hidden. I'm thirsty for a human body. Not mine! There will be no power but Your help, the ruler of heaven and earth. Not mine, either. There will be no power but Your help, the ruler of heaven and earth. There will be no power but Your help, the ruler of heaven and earth. There will be no power but Your help, ruler of heaven and earth. Aiden, don't empty your mind! Aiden! Aiden! Maira. Maira! Are you okay, Maira? Aiden? Wait here. Raynard! Look whose body I'm controlling. This body is stronger. Raynard! Laras, now you will die! Die! Laras! Open it! Laras! Open it! Open! Laras! Open the door! Laras! Open it! Laras, they've taken everything from you. Your husband. Your child. Don't let them take more. Laras, open it! There will be no power but Your help, ruler of heaven and earth. Laras, die! There will be no power but Your help, ruler of heaven and earth. There will be no power but Your help, ruler of heaven and earth. There will be no power but Your help, ruler of heaven and earth. There'll be no power but Your help, God. There will be no power but Your help! Raynard. Get the Sabrina doll. Bring it here immediately. Okay. There'll be no power but Your help, God. There will be no power but Your help, the Almighty God. There will be no power -but Your help. -I seek refuge in You from the demon and all things evil. I seek refuge in You from the demon and all things evil. I seek refuge in You from the demon and all things evil. I seek refuge in You from the demon and all things evil! There will be no power but Your help. -There will be no power -There will be no power -but Your help! -but Your help! -There will be no power -There will be no power -but Your help! -but Your help! -There will be no power -There will be no power but Your help! Give me the doll. -There will be no power but Your help! -There will be no power but Your help! There will be no power but Your help! There will be no power but Your help! There will be no power but Your help! You are the ruler of both worlds. There will be no power but Your help and no one defies Your will. There will be no power... Aiden? -Aiden. -Aiden! -Aiden. -Aiden. Aiden. Laras, are you okay? Laras? Do you want to see me die? You first, demon! Laras. POLICE Every time I finish a case, I always think about the lesson I can take as something to guide us in the future. ARKA KEV SON OF BRAMANTYO K. This time, I saw that the envy and jealousy that has been buried for a long time can destroy a person's good side. ANDINI DAUGHTER OF WIDYASASTI To the deepest pit of darkness, no matter how scary the demons are out there, people's evil hearts are more terrifying. Vanya. Vanya? Aunt Maira? Aunt Maira? Aunt Maira? Aunt Maira? Mom? Vanya. Vanya, my love. I have to go now, dear. Where are you going? I have to return to the afterlife. I've accepted all of the things that had happened. And now, my life is not here anymore. Do you want to make me happy? Vanya, I don't want to see you being sad anymore. You're lucky to have Mama Maira. And you'll be okay. Mama Maira loves you. Do you understand, dear? Mom? Mom! Vanya? What's wrong with you, dear? I dreamed of meeting my mom. It's really my mom. She's happy now. And she doesn't want to see me being sad anymore when I remember her. I'm lucky to have you who is kind, loves me, and will take care of me forever and become my mother. Mom, don't ever leave me, okay? I love you. I will never leave you, Vanya. This scar will forever be visible. A proof that I've finished a big case with you. Living with someone like me will never be easy, Raynard. I know. Living with someone like me will not be easy, either, Laras. But with you, I could improve the gift that God has given me. Ever since we met, you've been taking care of me, completing me, and now I'm not facing all of this alone. What is it, Laras? A case involving dolls. One family. Worse than Sabrina.
