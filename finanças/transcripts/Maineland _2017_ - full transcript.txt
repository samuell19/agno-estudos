(peaceful music) - [Stella] The first time I learned about America was when I met a cute little American boy in kindergarten. It was my first impression of America, and I thought all the boys in America were cute. However, the first time I fell in love with America was in middle school, when I watched a famous movie called High School Musical. The movie described daily life in an American high school. It showed how American students study, play, and date. Since then I started dream about studying in America. Then I look at a newspaper that said, go to America for senior high school. (moody electronic music) - [Man] I have a strong desire to be a member of your school. - [Woman] I must go to America to study. - [Woman] Very excited for a whole new life for me. - [Chris] In the late 90s and the early 2000s, there really started to be a decline in applicants for American boarding schools. That's when schools really discovered the international market. What had just been a nice thing to have some diversity now became essential for viability. At that time, the largest population was the Japanese students. That quickly shifted to the Korean students. After 2006 when the floodgates opened from China, and especially after 2008, when the economy turned, China quickly became the largest population of international students and that shows no sign of stopping. - [Man] It's 1,759. This is your schedule. - We were founded in 1792, which makes us the eighth oldest private school in the United States. We are a co-ed day and boarding school, we have about 650 students total. And most of our students are day students, about 500, come from all the towns around. And our goal is to have about 12 or 15 Chinese students for each grade. - [Chris] What are you most excited about when you think about coming to America, to boarding school? - Chinese school always has a lot of homework. - I want give me some free time. - Chinese education is exam-oriented. We have a lot of homework. A lot of, a lot of, a lot of, a lot of. - [Harry] There is a teaching style like critical thinking? We can talk about our different opinions? - Yeah, in the U.S. the idea is that the students should begin to think for themselves. What do you like to do for fun, on the weekends, to relax? - I'm good at basketball. - [Student] This is my ship models, this is a small one. - [Chris] Do you like math and science, like arts? - I like math. - Americans are terrible at math. (laughs) It's okay, it's alright, we're fat and lazy. We're not ashamed to admit it. * Just gotta stand there and heard me cry * * It's alright because I love the way you lie * * Love the way you lie (giggles) * - [Chris] Tell me about your future goals. What are some of your future goals? - Teacher? - Really? What kind of teacher? - Math teacher. - Math teacher? - Yes, it's interesting. - Yeah. - My father is a businessman. I want to study business to be his good assistant. Yeah, but I also want to be an artist. - I'm, uh, learning music composition. I want to join the band. - [Chris] What do your parents think? - My father is a very, a man, a very kind man, I mean. When he was 18, my grandparent gave my father 1,000 pounds, let my father went to England by himself. - Wow. - Yeah. My father didn't use that 1,000 pounds, he worked, and earned money for his study, until he came back to China. - [Chris] So what happened to the 1,000 pounds? - He gave it back to my grandparents. - Oh, when he comes back home? - Yes. - I'm the member of Mifan Mama. A charity organization which helps Chinese orphans. My father donate 100,000 Yuan for each year. They are so happy and they all hug me and kiss me. "Oh, sister, sister," like that. - [Chris] Wow, okay, that's good, yeah. - [Stella] (chuckles) Why, oh, it's so sad? - No, that's okay. - Okay, hi. Hi, hi. - Sad is part of life. We can't always be happy. What am I looking for, family name what? - [Woman] H-E. - H? - Yes. - [Chris] Oh, there's Harry. Harry was young, naive, and quirky. He had that curious mind. - [Woman] I think that Stella's gonna be more of like a leader or organizer addition to the community. You probably got the same impression. - Stella came in like a whirlwind, I had zero expectations, and she came in and, yeah, like a house on fire. - When I first read his application, I was put off. He is the son of successful bankers, he expects to make his first bucket of gold as soon as he's old enough. - [Chris] Did he use "bucket of gold?" - He actually used "bucket of gold," yeah. But he didn't come across this way in the interview at all, in fact, he said that while his parents want him to go into economics, he would prefer to be an archaeologist and study dinosaurs. - [Woman] They think they're giving us what we want to hear, and clearly they don't understand that what we want to know, is how they actually think. (laughs) - [Chris] Something closer to the truth. - Something resembling the truth. They think we wanna hear that they're all, the kids are so driven and they wanna be economists, but obviously that's not the case. - You wanna go on? - Enthusiastic and likable. Traveled quite a bit, liked Japan the most. Likes American pop music, Green Day and Eminem. He plays the trumpet. He plays in the school drum corps. His sister is in school in Toronto, studying international relations. (lively music) Prodigal. Profligate. (laughs) (peaceful pop music) (bright chime music) (moody electronic music) (upbeat piano music) - Hello! Today is a very special day for me. I'm so happy to receive the offer from Fryeburg. It's my ideal school, my dream comes true. I will not let you down, just believe in me. Now I'm so excited for everything. I expect my new school life, new friends, new class, I'm coming, see you soon! (moody pop music) (peaceful guitar music) - My name is Adele, I'm from South Portland, Maine. - Hey, I'm Julia, and I'm from China. - Hello, my name is Qiao. - Hi, I'm Jessie. - I'm Kat, I live in Chase, I'm from Boston. - I'm Sara, I'm from Spain. - Hi, I'm Stella! Nice to meet you! I'm junior and I'm in Frye Hall. - [Woman] Good morning, and who are you? - I'm, my last name is Za-hu, Zee-hu, sorry. - Z-H-U? - Z-H-U. - What country are you from? - China. - I'm going to need to order you health insurance, unless you have something different. Okay, give you that back. I don't want your I-20, this is the form I wanted. It's the most important paper you'll give anybody today. You get run over by a car, nobody's gonna help you, until I have that, (laughs) it's America. - [Harry's Father] One thing I worry about is that I hope he will not lost the confidence. - We always remind the students too that, to find the things that they're good at, you know? The students will learn from success, but they'll also learn from failure. - What is, seriously? (student laughs) (students speak Chinese) (bluesy guitar music) - [Student] Woo, I got a hit. - And you are? - Bianca. - And where you from? - China. - Henry, where you from? - Harry. - Harry, I'll get you right, Harry, where you from? - China. - Danielle, where you from? - Fryeburg. - I'm part Italian, part Columbian and part Venezuelan. - [Teacher] And you're the only Jamaican here? - Yeah. - What city? - In the center of China, you don't know. (students laugh) - [Teacher] I don't, that's why I ask questions. And how was your summer? - Just hung around, nothing really. - Worked, over at the Oxford House. - Was that a good job? - Uh, yeah, keeps you busy. - Travel and lose fat. (chuckles) I lost 20 pounds during the summer. - Study. - Did you study all day? - Well, six day a week. - So did you study all summer? - No, of course not. (students laugh) - Day care. - Was it a good job? - Yes. (students giggle) - [Teacher] So, tell everybody the population of your city. - Around eight million? - Okay. - What? - The entire state of Maine is one million, so his city, which is near Shanghai, has eight million. - [Student] That's New York, the biggest city in our country is not even the biggest city in China. - [Teacher] While you're here, you're doing something that's very brave. You are taking a big risk to go to another place. To meet all new people, it's kind of a scary thing. Okay, so you all have a piece of paper. So I want you to think for a minute about what are your goals? Three things you wanna do this year. - Wait, just the new kids? - Everyone can do it. (background chatter) - [Teacher] That was not rude. Believe me, Stella, that's fine. It's cool that you asked about your grade. That means that you care, I gave you an A minus, but I'm sure you'll get an A for the class, like I hardly spend any time on grades 'cause it's so early and I didn't really look and I know you're doing well. So you probably do deserve an A. And I think you will get an A. Those grades that got put out, they don't go on your permanent record. - Okay. - Okay? - Thanks. - Yes. The worst part of my job is doing grades. It's like, doesn't match at all with what I wanna do here, is just like make art with kids. (chuckles) - In the story of the Outsiders, there are two distinct groups, the socs, and the greasers. The socs are the rich kids with the cars. They have the nice clothes. Greasers don't do very well in school. Their clothes are different. They're not necessarily bad, but different. Talk to me about their home life. Is it like your home life, May? - [May] I have a happy family. My mom and dad always around me. - [Teacher] You have a happy family. Your mom and dad are always around you. - Yeah and they care about me. - And they care about you. Everybody else agree? - For some strange reason my parents are still alive, and my siblings are smaller than me. - [Teacher] For some strange reason your parents are still alive, should they be dead already? - No, I didn't say that. I just said for some strange reason they're alive. - [Teacher] Okay? So, okay, so, you can relate a little bit, except what's the difference? Your parents are still there, yeah? Remember the other day, when we were talking about judging people by how they look? What do you notice about their hair? Before the end of the book, I think you will choose who you would rather hang out with. Socs or Greasers? Bohan. - I don't know. (students laugh) - [Teacher] Just tell me, who do you think maybe? Socs or greasers? - Maybe socs. - Socs. - The same. - Socs. - Pday. - I don't know, probably the socs. - Socs. - Greasers of course greasers. - Socs. - Socs. - Socs. - Socs. - Greasers. - Socs. - [Teacher] Socs. I don't know, I'm thinking you're not speaking English. - It just bad pronunciation. (Bianca laughs) - [Teacher] Come on, you know the rules. (students speaks in Chinese) (student speaks Chinese) (Harry laughs) (horn music) - So, gentlemen, put that bit up, put that bit in the index. Three quarters of an inch is the thickness of your stock. What is half of three quarters? Talked about this, you double the denominator, right? Three eighths, right, Harry? - I don't know. (chuckles) - [Teacher] You're gonna hold it like this, with your hand over the groove, and work it through the cutter bit. (saw buzzes) - [Teacher] Okay, ready? Five, six, seven, eight. Okay, do it again. Have you fronted a lift before? - No, the first time. - Okay. - [Stella] This is the first time I've gone to cheerleading. - The lift, okay. Don't look at the ground, don't focus on what they're doing. Just just focus on what you're gonna do, okay? Ready? - Five, six, seven, eight. One, two. - Stick it, stick it! Good, there you go, cradle! Five, six, seven, eight. (students laughs) - [Teacher] Almost a fourth of the season, guys, it's done. (students chatter) Alright, guys, gets the balls together. Guys, Harry's in as striker. Ben, run, that's you! - Shawn, take it out! Nice! - On this grass, man. - That's alright. - [Teacher] That's classy, Josh. (hip-hop music) * Shorty had them Apple Bottom Jeans * * Boots with the fur * The whole club was lookin' at her * * She hit the floor, next thing you know * * Shorty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low * * Them baggy sweat pants and the Reebok's with the straps * (peaceful guitar music) (students laugh) - [Teacher] Why did Colonel Shaw's men have to set fire to the town? - His superior officer told him to do it. - [Teacher] Okay, superior officer told him to do it. Colonel Shaw is a colonel, the other guy is a colonel! So why is one colonel able to give an order to another colonel? He's been a colonel longer. So, sort of like, um, Korean, right? What's the deal with Korean students here? Korean students, do you have a hierarchy still? Is there a one head Korean? Is there a head Korean here at the Academy anymore? A boss Korean? - Um, I don't think so. - [Teacher] You don't think so or you're not gonna tell me? - I think before there were. - Okay, before there was. There used to be. - Yeah. - [Teacher] And the deal with that is, if you're born like three minutes before me, guess who's in charge? We used to have a lot of Japanese students. They took respect very seriously. Those were the bad old days. I don't think it's like that anymore, right? If Kenta doesn't bow to you, are you gonna go out in the woods and break his arm? Cute little Kenta, no, right, of course not. You're gonna say "Hai" and he's gonna say "Hai" and everything will be good, right? - This is the first year that I've had a lot of Asian students in my class. A lot of Asian students really didn't take many art classes, certainly not a filmmaking class. So, you're making a documentary. What's the perceptions of Asians and Europeans? Is that what you are setting out to achieve? - [Students] Yeah. - So, what are you finding out so far? - Respectful. - Intellectual. - Smart. - Shy. - In general, I would say that the Asian students stay friends mainly with the Asian students. - I have seen a few Asians with Americans, but it's more they feel more comfortable with themselves. - [Student] But, you know, everyone goes into the woods to smoke anyway, so. - [Student] Everyone, they're all usually working really, really hard, I think that's the biggest difference, but, you know, everyone goes into the woods to smoke anyway, so. - [Student] Felt really bad actually, I felt really bad for them because I knew if I went to a foreign school, I'd be terrified. - [Teacher] Is any of this true? - Yeah. - Yeah. - [Teacher] Which is true, are you hard-working? - Kinda. - [Teacher] Just you or all Asians? (chuckles) - I think-- - Most of, most. - I think all of them are true. But that's not what we are trying to get. - [Teacher] What're you trying to get at, okay? So, this is the answers you've gotten so far. So, what're you trying to get? - The thing they talk to us about, from their personal mind. - So, you think that what they're saying is not personal? - Maybe they think like, Asian is too, it's kind of strange, and when they talk to you, they don't look at your eyes. - Why is that? - 'Cause we are nervous. - Back in China, everybody takes the same class, and everybody is doing the same test, so people cannot figure out what they really like or who they really are. - Everyone is the same, yeah. - Which is stupid. - If I live in a little town, I live in Fryeburg Maine, I've never seen Asians except, you know, in Fryeburg. You come to school here, and they all talk to each other. - Even if a Chinese and a Korean sit next together, they won't talk to each other. They would like to talk with others in their own language. - We're afraid. - [Teacher] Of what? - Making mistake? - [Teacher] Making mistake? I'm glad you're in my class, 'cause you've taught me a lot. - Study hall, guys, let's open your doors, prop 'em open! Library. There you go, here's your pass. - Thanks, thank you. - You're welcome. You guys need to get your shoes out of the hallway, please. Study hall, let's go, guys! Guys, let's open up! You must have work to do. I'm not sure who I've seen and who I haven't seen at this point. But for some reason, I can't keep you guys straight. I can always keep Johnny straight. - Why? (laughs) Why they? - [Teacher] Why can I not keep you straight, I don't know. It's a mental block, you know? If you ever called me something besides Miss Gibson, it's just a mental block. Actually, I really shouldn't mix you up anymore. (bright piano music) - When the Egyptian revolution happened, they used this same symbol. Does that have meaning for you in China? If somebody did this, what would you think it means? - On the bus. - On the bus! (laughs) Riding the bus. (laughs) That's great. - [Student] Maybe it means unite. - Maybe it means uniting together, okay, right, yeah. In America, I think it has a kind of angry feeling to do this. If there's a lot of people doing it, yeah, it has that kind of power. - [Teacher] Gandhi used the system of get the news out and share it with the world and people will change. I'm especially looking for stories of nonviolent actions people did there. - Tank Man? - Yeah. - [Teacher] What do you think we should tell about this story? What did he do, what was the response? - [Reporter] Heading down the road was a hazardous business. - [Teacher] You think he did it as a news stunt. So, he told somebody, "Okay, film me. "I'm gonna go down and stop the tanks." - Yeah. - Interesting. - [Reporter] Casualties were arriving every-- - [Teacher] Do we know who those people are? - Students, maybe? - Yeah. - [Reporter] The operating theater was overflowing. Many of the staff in tears. - [Teacher] You know what non-violent actions they did? - You mean the students? - Sure. - Okay, a hunger strike, why would they do that? - And did it stop the government? Did they get what they wanted changed? - No. - Uh-huh, so maybe one result was something they expected, they wanted, they got people to join them, but another result was unexpected. (bell rings) (moody piano music) - Stella. - Strong, strong. - Cheerleader. - Cheerleader. - Good job. - Good job. - That's good. - Good job. - [Cheerleaders] We love, we love our football team. L-O-V-E, we love, we love our football team. A-T-T-A-C-K, The Raiders are back. A-T-T-A-C-K, attack, attack, attack! Go, go, bang, bang, win, win, bang, bang. Go, bang, win, bang, go, bang, win! (spectators applaud) Hustle, hustle, score, score, we want more! Hustle, hustle, score, score, we want more! Five, six, seven, eight. - Here we go, Raiders! - Come on, Raiders! (spectators applaud) (distant bell tolls) (riders scream) (moody music) (riders scream) * Ever had a dream * Of watermelon wine * Yeah - I'm dying. * Ain't but three things * In this world * That's worth one solitary doubt * * And that's old dogs and children * * And watermelon wine * A little story that goes along, but it's a true story * * He said, women, they think about they-selves * * When their menfolk ain't around * * And friends are hard to find * When they discover that you're down * * He said, I tried it all * When I was in my natural prime * * Now it's old dogs and children * * And watermelon wine (public announcement in foreign language) - Mommy! (moody piano music) (moody guitar music) (moody guitar music) - [Student] Oh my god, hi, I love your new hair! - Are you cheering this year? - No. - Oh, how come? - I don't know. I've got too much college stuff. - Too much college stuff? - Yeah. - Okay, so, have you thought more about the schools on your list? - [Stella] Yeah. - Are you looking for teacher certification? No? (Stella chuckles) No, now? - I don't know. - That's a shift for you, okay? You're interested in business, and that's what you told your parents, correct? - Yeah. (laughs) - Right? But I also know that you want to teach. And you wanna teach little people, young people, right? - [Stella] They think I can get double majors, you know? But they're not okay if I just learn education, to teach. - [Teacher] Okay and so for you, is that a conflict for you? - My parents pay a lot for me to come to America, and if I just teach, I don't think I can get the money back for them. And I need, get something for them, you know? I don't want just come to America and just learn the same thing in China, be a teacher. It's, um, it's my dream, but it's too common. - [Teacher] So for you, you have this understanding, that you will be needing to take care of your parents? - Mm-hm. - And you can better do that, not as a teacher, but in the world of business. - Yeah. - That's interesting. So, can you do both? Can you marry both things? - Yeah, I was thinking about, like, I wanna be a businessman, businesswoman, and when I get older, maybe I will own a school. Kindergarten or something, when I'm getting old. - Right. Okay, so while we're here then, can you open up your Penn State application? So, okay, well, are your parents married and together? - No, they're not. - They're not, okay. So, who is your guardian? - My mom. - Okay. That's been submitted and payment's submitted, you've successfully submitted your common app to Michigan State University. (moody guitar and piano music) - (chuckles) My topic is Maine blueberry. Maine actually the origin of the blueberry plant. Here I have example like Rolex in the watch. When you have this watch, it means you are a successful person. Just like those famous thing in watch and cars. I want blueberry become a star in the fruits. (students laugh) Yeah, how many of you ate blueberries before? Okay, almost everyone. How many of you know it is healthy? Everyone again. How many of you eat it at least once a week? See, there is only two. (students laugh) And how many of you are willing to eat it more than now? Yes, so this is the opportunity we have. - Are there many opportunities to eat blueberries right now in China? - There are blueberries in the supermarket, but it's very expensive, so I think that's a-- - So, it's a big market. - Yeah, it's a big market. (students applaud) - [Teachers] Read the schools. Tell me the schools that you just added. - [Harry] Boston University, Ohio State University. - [Teacher] ow you have Susquehanna on there. How did you end up with that one on your list? - [Harry] I heard that some small college might have a better elber arts education? - [Teacher] Liberal arts, mm-hm. What do you like to study? - I put three. - [Teacher] Business, music, and philosophy, why? - Well, it's my interest. - Mm-hm, and when did you become interested in philosophy? - Oh, before I came out. - Before you came to Fryeburg? - Mm-hm. - And music, studying performance? - Maybe composing. - Oh. - Yeah. - Okay. - Do you want to hear my idea for the supplemental essay? - [Teacher] Sure, yeah, for which school? - Wheaton and Boston college. - Yeah. (somber piano music) (lively chatter in Chinese) - [Chris] In 2015, for us at Fryeburg, over half of the international students are Chinese. No school's perfect, no education system is perfect, but, most of them really appreciate that significant change. A whole way of thinking opens up for that student. That's a powerful thing. - Who's your date? - Nicola. - Shoot, she's almost as tall as me now. - Yeah, look at my heels. - Woo! - Whoa, look at those heels! Are you gonna be able to dance in those? Where's everybody else? (soulful piano and guitar music) (lively dance music) * Turn down for what * Turn down for what * Talk dirty to me * Talk dirty to me * Talk dirty to me (somber atmospheric music) - Will you join me, and let's ask for the Lord's blessing, on this event. O gracious heavenly father, we thank you for this day that you have made. We thank you for the time given, to each of these students here at Fryeburg Academy, and we ask for your continued blessing on this great school. We thank you for teachers, mentors, counselors, and friends. Encourage their hearts, to know the hope of your calling and fill them with your peace. It is in Jesus' name that I pray, Amen. * Our flag was still there * O say does that star-spangled * * Banner yet wave * O'er the land of the free * And the home of the brave (students cheer and applaud) (students applaud) (students applaud and cheer) * From sea to shining sea * America * America * America - [Student] Everyone's starting to spread out. Hearing everyone, it's sad. - [Harry] That's what happen! - He was a good student, he was a good student. Okay, good luck, keep in touch, okay? - See ya, man. - What am I gonna do? I'm not gonna have my band partner anymore. - There will be others. - Yeah but then I'll have to be partners with Brooke. You'll have to come back, you can't graduate. That's the only solution, you have to come back. - There will be new students coming, remember that? - No, no, no, no. - Oh, okay. - Harry's coming back. - Okay, I will come back and see you next year. - Come back in the fall, good luck. - Yeah, you too. - I'll miss you. - Me too. (both laugh) (bittersweet music) (firework pops) (bluesy music) (moody music)
