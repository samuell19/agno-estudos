So they're gonna teach them new songs. Maybe I can photograph that and use that first. - Do you know what I mean? - Mmm. Yeah. If you go from this, into the learning, and then from the learning - and right into the song. - Right, I get it. You know what I mean, and build it that way. I'd like to say good evening to everybody. We'd like to thank you for coming tonight, to the first religious recording session of the Lady Soul, Miss Aretha Franklin. And, uh, we want you tonight to be a part of this session. We want you to, uh, you know, let the folk know you're here. Many of you who never had the opportunity to hear Aretha sing Gospel, you're in tonight for a great thrill. She can sing anything. "Three Blind Mice"... Anything! I'd like for you to be mindful though, that this is a church and we're here for a religious service. And we want you to be a part of it. We want you to give vent to the spirit. Those of you who are not hip to giving vent to the spirit, then you do the next best thing. Aretha's got some fantastic people that came this week, helped us to put together what you're going to witness tonight. Great fellows that work in the band. It's been a privilege and a pleasure to work with them, and I'm gonna kind of hate to see them go. And tonight, I want you to relax and enjoy one of the greatest sounds in the world. And that's the sound of Gospel. And whatever you hear tonight, just remember, tomorrow night's gonna be better. And if I seem a little misty, it's just because I'm happy. I'm happy for the Southern California Choir. For us, this is a dream come true. And I'd like for you at this time to welcome the young folk that are gonna back Aretha. Won't you receive the Southern California Community Choir. We are on our way. ON OUR WAY We are on our way To a land To a land of brighter day We are on our way We're on our journey home When we get to glory We will shout We will shout And tell the story Of how we made it over We're on our journey home We are on our way - We are on our way - Oh, yeah To a land To a land of brighter day We are on our way We are on our journey Home Thank you. Now, the young lady that we've all been waiting to hear. She's known by many names, and deservedly so, she's earned every title. But it's my pleasure tonight to just say, my sister, Miss Aretha Franklin. Give her a big hand! Now, as you know, this is a recording session and if things should happen and we have to take it over, you understand how that is. So, if you said "Amen" on it first, and we have to take it over when we get back to that spot, you say "Amen" again, you hear? And if we have to take it over again, you say "Amen" again. All right. Uh, she could have very easily have gone into a studio and done this album, but she wanted to do something live. And the only reason we wanted to do it live is to get the audience participation. So now, those of you here got to sound like about 2,000. Can you sound like 2,000? Let me hear it, come on! Right on! All right. Our first selection tonight is gonna be a little number that was done by brother Marvin Gaye. And it's called "Wholy Holy". Ladies and gentlemen, Aretha Franklin, the Southern California Choir. WHOLY HOLY Wholy holy Come together wholy People, we've got to come together Because we need the strength The power And all of the feeling Wholy holy We should believe In each other's dreams We've got to come together Because we need the strength The power And all of the feelings Wholy holy We can conquer things forever Yes, we can Jesus left a long time ago Said He would return He left us a book to believe in Oh, yes, He did And in it we've got a lot to learn Wholy holy, holy Do you know that we can Rock the world's foundation?

The other day in rehearsal, Aretha began to sing it... and when she got to the part that says, "Through many dangers..." ...and I looked over at her and saw the tears rolling out of her eyes... because never did we think, I think, 20 years ago, that God would do great things for us.

A young woman... who is among many of the people, who inspired this great singer tonight. And we thought tonight to honor her by bringing her right down front. A young lady, who is still very much deeply rooted in Gospel and I speak of none other than the famous Miss Clara Ward. To present the man that made this one possible, her father, Reverend C.L. Franklin of Detroit, Michigan! Ladies and gentlemen, please bear with us. We have hearing difficulty that won't be a minute. We got a whole cup of water spilt into a great deal of electrical wires here. When she's working from this microphone, can you hear her good? - No. - You can't, right?

We're going to do a little song that we're gonna borrow from Reverend C.L. Franklin. One of his old numbers that he loved to sing all the time. We're going to dress it up a little, and I'm sure he won't recognize it. A little song that says I'm climbing higher mountains, trying to get home. - All right, are you with us? - Yeah.

We'd like very much to have Aretha's father just come forward. We see him so seldom. Reverend C.L. Franklin. Let's give him a hand! Reverend Cleveland... and to all of the musicians and this great choir, I think that Reverend Cleveland picked a bad time for me to make a talk. Behind all of the spirit and enthusiasm that Aretha has engendered here tonight. Um... I know that you were impressed with her gift, with her voice, with that intangible something that is hard to describe. But it was more than that to me. It took me all the way back... to the living room at home. When she was six and seven years of age... it took me back to about 11, when she started travelling with me on the road, singing Gospel. I saw you crying... and I saw you responding. But I was just about to bust wide open! You talking about being moved. Not only because Aretha is my daughter. And, of course, you know I wouldn't be right upstairs if I didn't appreciate that. But I say with pride that Aretha is not only my daughter... Aretha is just a stone singer! I was looking at Mother Ward. Where is she? There she is! I was looking at her and I know that she remembers all of those days. Reverend James Cleveland... knows about those days. He and Aretha used to go in the living room and spend hours in there, singing different songs. And Aretha, with that uncanny ear, picked up many of his techniques. She is influenced greatly by James... greatly by Mahalia Jackson... greatly by Clara Ward. But Aretha has done something with what she learnt from James, what she learnt from Mahalia, what she learnt from Clara, what she has learnt from all of the singers that she has heard and brought it into a synthesis. Now, what am I talking about? I went in the cleaners one day in Detroit, to pick up some clothes. And Aretha had appeared on a recent television show, and she told me, "I saw your daughter, Aretha, last night." I said, "Yes. How did you like it?" She said, "It was all right." Said, "But I'll be glad when she comes back to the church." I said, "Listen, baby, let me tell you something. "If you want to know the truth, "she has never left the church!" God bless. I'm just happy to be... Miss Ward called me last night, and I talked with Aretha last night, and I didn't sleep much after that. I ran and grabbed me a few suits and some socks. I don't know if I got them all straight or not and decided to be here for this tonight. I'm just happy for Reverend Cleveland and I'm happy for this great choir. God bless you all. And I've had a wonderful time. When we first heard Aretha Franklin many years ago, we heard her singing this song. I have heard of a land where we shall never grow old. NEVER GROW OLD I have Heard Of a land On the far The far away Strand 'Tis the The beautiful Home Of the soul It was built By Jesus Jesus On a high There Where we never Never will die 'Tis a land where we'll Never Grow Grow old We'll never Never grow old Never grow old Never, never, never Never Mmm Never grow old I know there's a land There's a land where we'll never Never grow old We ain't gonna grow old We'll We'll never Oh, grow old We'll never Yeah, Aretha!
