Male voice: He parks his car and he gets out. Beautiful two story house. Skies full of fluffy clouds. (Mellow music) (Mellow music) (Mellow music) My name is Harry. I along with my associate would move money that had to be laundered. But all things come to an end. Even my partnership with Mr. Jones. I took care of my business with him and then headed for San Francisco. (Mellow music) (Squeaking) (Slam) (Mellow music) (Mellow music) (Mellow music) He parks his car and he gets out. It's a beautiful two story house. The sky is blue with small fluffy clouds. White picket fence surrounds the green lawn.

I won't be going out. You can check on me on Sunday. I should be gone. I'm gonna have some groceries delivered. Is this the only exit? Mmm-hmm. Where's the best pizza? Can you order me one? Plain. Medium. (Footsteps) He wakes up slowly. He feels good. He could hear the voices of children playing outside. He leans over, smells the pillow next to him. He loves the way she smells.

(Gagging) (Flushing) (Groan) Fuck it. He hears someone in the shower. He gets out of bed, walks over to the bathroom. He doesn't bother to put on his clothes. The bedroom its safe and it's Sunday morning and the kids know this. The bathroom is steamy. He can barely make out the outline of the woman in the shower. It's her face. Soaks her hair. Runs down her breasts. Small and perfect. A soft triangle of her thighs. (Click) (Rattling) (Rattling) (Mellow music) I can't figure out who killed somebody and would leave that much money. Recorder: Runs down her breasts. That's not by the book Max. Shut up. Recorder: Soft triangle of her thighs. The lemon puzzled me. We'd also found one next to a small time hustler named Benny Santiago. He'd call me a few days earlier saying he had something on a guy names Mr. Jones. Evidently Mr. Jones was after him for something and Benny wanted Mr. Jones off his back. Benny never called me. (Radio chatter) (Mumbling) Shut up. No you shut up. Shut up. (Clang) Harry's here. 442 Road Island street. I want to appear this Sunday, the 21st yeah. Read it back to me. Harry's here. 442 Rhode Island street, and is to appear this Sunday, right? The 21st.

In the same spot. Oh, uh, we haven't seen her for a while. We thought it was OK to rent to you. See, I told you Lila. She lives there? Oh, no. Her husband rented it as a cooking studio and then one day, he just left. The woman thinks she's still taking care of him. We haven't seen her for a while. So, Lila thought (Rustling) (Tap) (Tapping) (Chiming) (Sipping) (Office noises) (Crumpling) No, I have to work late tonight. I love you too.

This must have been taken a long long time ago. Come on, we got a meeting. Max, that hasn't been logged in yet. A real world passes by. (Click) The rest of the world can move on, but for him, his life has ceased. He moves through the world all around. The real world swirls by. I wondered what my associate, Mr. Jones, was doing. He was probably looking for me. Wait, wait, wait. OK. Lemon. The Lemon. The lemon.

You shouldn't talk with your mouth full. It's not polite. I told you over and over again you shouldn't talk with your mouth full. I'm not your husband. I'm just a... Shhh. What the?

(Mellow music) (Mellow music) (Mellow music) (Mellow music) (Mellow music) My grandfather used to have a laundry on Pool street. In old Japan town. (Running water) I used to play there as a kid with my brothers and sisters. We used to jump right into the laundry cart into the hot fluffy white close, and my grandfather would bury us in all the clothes right out of the dryer. (Singing) (Singing Japanese) (Hissing) (Footsteps) (Humming) They take money that's got all these fades and spots on them. I take them to some place like in I can get it all out. I bring it back all clean, no germs, no nothing. (Footsteps) (Office noises) Don't I get a hug or something? (Office noises) Long time no see, Jules. How you been? I've been fine Howard. Thanks for being so concerned. What do you want? You gonna see Harry? You can't blame him forever Howard. Sent me away to some boys school in the middle of nowhere. You're all grown up now. He tries to see you now and then, doesn't he? He told me he tried. Ahem. Hi. Hello. It's just some personal business. Yeah, personal. I think he's really sick Howard. Really sick. Do you have lights? Lights. (Mellow music) (Mellow music) (Mellow music) Wow. (Mellow music) (Exhale) (Mellow music) (Mellow music) (Mellow music) I came home late, I should have called, but I didn't. He was just laying there, like he was resting. A pool of blood around his head, like a halo. He looked like a sleeping angel. So peaceful. I felt unclean, like i wasn't deserving of him. I had to go. I walked for hours. I went into a bar for help and I met a man. I don't remember what he looked like. He must have looked pitiful because he took me into the bathroom to clean me up. While he was wiping my face, he began to slip his hand under my dress. I remember thinking I was dirty and this is what I deserved. And my husband sleeping so pure. So innocent. And I was unclean. And his hand kept pushing up in between my legs. When I got home, when I finally got home, he was gone. (Mellow music) (Rattling) Apple pie. Our mother's favorite recipe. Oh, we didn't tell you everything. The woman who comes here. The husband who disappeared. Well, uh, he didn't really disappear. He got killed. Right here in this place. It's good with ice cream He would have died anyway. And black coffee too. We all have to go sometime. It's our mother's favorite recipe. I told you that already, didn't I?

My beautiful wife, my two lovely children. Sometimes, a single event can be so terrible that it makes the man blind to the world. Until one day, he looks in the mirror. And he sees himself. Fuck. Well, I hardly recognized you. Yeah? Well, it's been a while. You look very pretty princess. No I don't. Is Howard here? No. (Clang) Interesting place. Smells like chicken. Mmm... I love roasted chicken. Salt baked chicken. Excuse me. (Chopping) Is it over done? Al dente. You know how Maurice tests if it's ready? It's got to stick. There you go. Just a little bit more. You still with Maurice? We're married, remember? He got a job or anything? He's got some part time stuff. He's keeping real busy. He's not doing that video thing is he? (Laughs) Is it OK to drink? No, Harry, it's not OK to drink. I always had to be good enough for you. Because you were never there, and maybe if I were smarter or prettier you would notice and come visit me, but that didn't work. You are pretty. No I'm not! But it's OK. It's OK. It's OK. See, because I figured it out. Being a good daughter doesn't work. Is that why. Why I what? Why I what Harry? Huh? Why you got sick? I'm an addict Harry. I don't have the flu. You showed up anyway. Didn't you? Anytime I needed you, all I had to do was get sick. (Motor running) Howard. Hello. Let me help you. You were this small the last time I saw you. Those need to be washed. Hi Howard. Long time no see. Germs. Well, how do you have sex Howard? Or do you have sex? Yes, I have sex, unlike you, it's normal. How boring. (Running water) Sulfites. I'll have water. Howard's fruit is cleaned. Well, let's have a toast. Bottled? For god's sake Howard, just drink the damn thing. To family. (Clink) (Striking) Is there cilantro in this? Yes, just a little. You can't hardly taste. I can't eat cilantro. Just eat it Howard. I can't eat it. Eat the damn thing. I can't eat it. It messes up my stomach. Good! It'll blow out the stick you got up your ass! If you eat it Howard. If you eat the pasta, you can play your guitar for us. Oh no. Can I sing too? Yes. You can sing too. Jesus christ. (Sipping) Ah good boy. Have some more. Did you see that? I know how Howard singing makes you. I'm sorry. I just fainted. Mmm. It's good. I'm fine. It's OK. It's OK. Come on, let's just eat. What? Come on eat. Let's all eat. (Gagging) (Gagging) (Gagging) (Sipping) I just wanted to have a good time. At least once. We can do it again Daddy. We can can't we? The lights. You OK? I'm fine. I'm really fine, OK? I've been seeing my counselor regularly and it's been almost a year now. I'm moving to Vancouver next month. To get a fresh start. If I stay around here, I'll just get into trouble. Going with Maurice? You have to accept him daddy. He's my husband. I don't know why you stay with him. You could do so much... Daddy! Did you ever stop and think that I'm not as special as you think I am? Maybe I'm lucky to have him. It's easier for me to get my dentist's license back. I could practice again. How are you doing? In your fax, I kind of got the idea that you were sick. Did you bring your equipment? Yeah, you want me to do you folks? Aaah. I need another drink. Me too. ♪ To the short. Hallelujah ♪ ♪ Michael row the boat ♪ ♪ ashore ♪ ♪ Hallelujah ♪ ♪ Hallelujah ♪ ♪ Michael ♪ ♪ row the boat ashore ♪ ♪ Hallelujah ♪ ♪ Oh yeah. Michael row the boat ♪ ♪ ashore. Hallelujah ♪ (Kissing sound) What did you do that for? So long have you been seeing that woman? What woman? The one in the office. The one that came in to check on us. I'm not seeing her. She's married, isn't she? Come on, give me a little credit, will you? Sometimes, you can't get all the love in one place. You can only get bits and pieces here and there. But just because you got bits and pieces growing up doesn't mean you have to settle for it now. Do you know what I do? For a living? Do you know what I do? You're an accountant. Yeah, you're an accountant. An accountant. Well, yeah, accountant. After after your mother died, I just drifted from place to place. I met a man who asked me to deliver. You're an accountant OK? That's what you have always been and that's what you are. Alright, Howard, I'm an accountant. This is for the two of you. This is to make up for all those years? Do you know what it feels like? It's like a hole in your body. A big hole. You try to cover it over. Oh my daddy doesn't visit because he's doing top secret work. Or he's busy with a crisis in the middle east. Or he was killed by terrorists. My daddy's dead. I'm sorry I didn't visit you. But it's no good. No good. (Thud) We were up in the foothills in the old country. We had gone there for a picnic. You kids were very small. I had eaten too much and I went for a walk while your mother watched over you. I was going to bring some flowers back to surprise her. There were these leaves on the ground. Orange, gold, reddish, wonderful hues, but there were these different kinds of leaves under a large dead tree. As I started to pick them, I noticed a mushroom growing underneath them. It was so unusual looking I brought it back to show it to your mother. She got very excited. She said, it was edible. And that they had the same kind of mushroom in Vietnam and it was very rare and the flavor was unlike anything she had ever tasted before. I didn't think it was a good idea but your mother as a child spent some time picking mushrooms with her grandmother. She knew. So, I agreed. And we brought the mushroom home and we cooked it and ate it and we were both in the hospital that evening. The liver failed her and she died that night. They managed to save my life. Your mother was right. The taste was like eating death. Daddy. It's time to move on. Let go. I don't know how. The best way to forget something that won't go away is to become still. Until the thing becomes restless. And it goes away by itself. (Intense music) (Cough) (Bell ringing) Come on! Up! Up! Everybody get up! Get up! Go! Go! Go! Oh my God. Come on move! Move! Move! Why, what's going on? I have an important client coming. Hates kids. Alright. Why? Just go. God. Come on, let's go. Here Howard. Take care of your brother. Good luck in Canada. Let's go. Move, come on. And Howard, listen to your sister. (Slam) (Ominous music) The way to forget something that won't go away is to become it, and that's what I was going to do. I planned to eat death.

(Groaning) Where's my money Harry? I don't have it. (Groan) Where's my money Harry? Where's the money? I don't know. Where's my money? (Ominous music) Who's that? Who's that? My cook. She's my cook. (Sizzling) (Humming) (Sniffing) Harry, we'll eat first. (Ripping sound) Give me some wine. (Sniffing) I feel a little guilty you eating that. I only have a few months to live. I was going to kill myself. You were supposed to find my body. Kind of buttery. Sweet, sour. Bitter thing happening. (Gagging) (Gasping) (Intense music) (Intense music) (Intense music) (Thud) (Thuds) (Heavy breathing) (Thuds) As we looked at Mr. Jones's face, it was shriveling up. Turning black and blue. (Jingling) Give me your wallet. (Office noises) Hold on a second. Check these out. Pick up the reports and see if they inventoried everything. See if we can look at the gun. Yeah, I'll take it, yeah. OK, where's that again. Hello. Hello. (Slam) What's up? 802 Bertraro. Some guy claims there's a body out there. Take Good notes on the spot. Don't rely on your memory. We got to file later on. I know, I know. Everything by the book. Do you know what fugu is? Fugu? Yeah, a blowfish. Japanese like to make sashimi out of it. It's poisonous. You have to cut out the poisonous sack. And this man was old and dying and he liked Fugu sashimi. He would have his chef prepare it in a very special though dangerous way. The man liked to have a little bit of poison still in the meat. So, as he ate it, his tongue would just tingle from the poison. The poison then put his fears in perspective. Let him appreciate the time he had left. (Heavy breathing) (Mellow music) (Laughter) (Mellow music) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Mellow music) (Radio chatter) (Slams) (Radio chatter) Jeez, look at this guy's face. It doesn't stink. The blood hasn't settled. Yet his face looks like he's been out here for weeks. Toxicology report. It's from a rare mushroom. Angel's nightcap. If enough is ingested, side effects of the poison include making the face turn black and shrivel, not unlike a prune. Extremities too. Feet, hands. Sometimes, it can leave a victim's face virtually unrecognizable. (Tap) His name was Harry Sado. Turns out he was a local. So he nosed around. His wife died in a freak accident years before. Just like me. (Mellow music) How was your husband killed? The man, the one that loved to eat food, was a dangerous man. And so, one day, the chef was distracted by his wife's affair and left a little too much poison in the meat. The dangerous man had dangerous friends who were not so forgiving. (Mellow music) Sometimes a single event can be so terrible that it makes a man blind to the world until one day he looks into the mirror and he sees himself. (Mellow music) Life life tastes good. (Motor running) (Chiming) (Mellow music) (Click) Thanks. Found a man's body in the area. This is an early photo of him. You seen him? Anything strange happen around here? How'd he die? I'm not sure that he did now. Though we can't prove anything. I could tell the detective knew who I was. For some reason, he let me go. If you see anything you'll let us know? It's as if he saw something in me he knew. Come on.
