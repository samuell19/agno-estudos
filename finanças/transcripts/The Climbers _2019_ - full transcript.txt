Meteorology Team to Ascent Team. That sound... Something is wrong. Calling Base Camp. Calling Meteorology Team. Ascent Team, does anybody copy? Please respond if you hear this! Please respond if you hear this! Year 1960. The height of the Great Chinese Famine. China faced a critical moment in border negotiations over Mount Everest. A climbing team from a neighboring country was preparing to summit from the south. China decided to form the Chinese Mountaineering Team. It was the first time that mankind would summit Mount Everest from the north. Every winter, demoiselle cranes undergo the most challenging migration on earth. Facing fierce storms, thousands of them will die. But they still persist in flying over the highest peak in the world, Mount Everest. This is Fang Wuzhou. When we first met, he was a climber on the national mountaineering team. Our story begins with him. Professor. I've read some foreign literature. Why did mountaineers in the West refuse to acknowledge that your team reached the summit of Mount Everest? Did the Chinese really make it to the summit? YEAR 1960 MOUNT EVEREST NORTH FACE 6,800 METERS -18 DEGREES CELSIUS, 10.4M/S WIND SPEED, 9.75 PERCENT OXYGEN Avalanche! - Retreat! - Go! Run! Run! Quick! Get up! Hide behind that rock! Quick! Dawa! Captain. - Captain! - Captain! - Captain! - Captain! - Captain! - Captain! Captain. Oxygen. I won't be needing it. Listen to me. This is our mountain. We must reach the summit. Wuzhou, you're the captain now. Get to the top. Let the world see... the strength of the Chinese. Promise... Promise me. Promise me. Yes, Captain. FIRST STEP 8,500 METERS -28 DEGREES CELSIUS, 23.5M/S WIND SPEED, 6.15 PERCENT OXYGEN SECOND STEP 8,680 METERS -33 DEGREES CELSIUS, 28.3M/S WIND SPEED, 5.35 PERCENT OXYGEN Songlin! No path. The path ends. It's downhill here too. Up ahead... There's no path either. Wuzhou, we... - We... - We are at the top! Yes, we are! Songlin. We're at the top! May 25, 1960. 4:20 a.m., Beijing Time. The Chinese Mountaineering Team successfully ascended the North Ridge and summited Mount Everest! The whole world will remember this day! Long live China! Long live China! CERTIFICATE FOR SUMMITING MOUNT EVEREST NATIONAL TEAM SUMMITS WORLD'S HIGHEST PEAK NO MOUNTAIN TOO TALL FOR THE CHINESE THE HIGHEST POINT NATIONAL TEAM SUMMITS WORLD'S HIGHEST PEAK My name is Xu Ying. The year Fang Wuzhou summited Everest, I was a student at the College of Meteorology. He told me that he had something to tell me when he returned from the summit. We used to meet at this abandoned factory Hardly anybody comes by. We liked to call it No Man's Land. We used to walk and talk here. We never imagined that what we started here would become a story with no ending. Look at this. These are my notes from the memoirs of my mountaineering idol, Mallory. Check out the section I marked. "I traveled a thousand miles to Venice all in pursuit of the woman I love, Ruth. Her crystal clear eyes gazed upon the 325-foot cathedral walls of St. Mark's Basilica, but she never glimpsed at me. Not even for a second. I climbed the cathedral with my bare hands, pulled myself up with my agile limbs, and stood atop it. Ruth, who never noticed me before witnessed my daredevil maneuver and daring courage. At the moment I was caught by the police, I captured her heart. Climbing brought us together." When we were coming down from the summit, we lost our way at 7,900 meters. Can you imagine how cold it was? There were icicles in our nostrils. We were out of food. All we had to eat was ice. Our guts and stomachs nearly froze. We couldn't keep our eyes open. But if we closed our eyes in that wind and snow, they would stay closed forever. But I wouldn't give up. I couldn't just close my eyes. I had to stay alive. There was something I still had to do. Xu Ying. There's something I want to tell you. Xu Ying, I want to say... Fang Wuzhou! We received a letter from Zhirinovsky! It's at Songlin's place. Get down from there! We need to report to Commissar Zhao. Everyone is waiting for you! What does the letter say? Show me. Zhirinovsky? Who is he? The Soviet Mountaineering Team's coach. He was our climbing teacher when we studied in the Soviet Union. Read it "To be acknowledged by the global mountaineering community, two conditions must be met. First, physical evidence left on the summit. Second, 360-degree photos taken on the summit. I believe that you reached the summit, but why are there no photos? Dear friends, I must say that this is a great pity. The global community has raised doubts, but I believe you were brave enough to summit. Best wishes." A successful summit requires photographic evidence. Yes, the coach said that is the international practice. Didn't we bring a camera up there? I was the photographer. I dropped the camera. Why are there no photos? We had to save Songlin's life. All right. Forget the Soviets. They like to stir up trouble. Our victory today and our achievements tomorrow don't need anybody else's acknowledgment. Yes, sir. Soon after, our country entered a harsher era. The mountaineering team was disbanded. The three summiteers went their separate ways. Qu Songlin went to work at the training camp. Jiebu returned to his hometown to look after sheep. And Fang Wuzhou was sent to work at a factory boiler room Sometimes, he teached. He couldn't climb anymore, but he could still talk about his mountaineering experiences. In 1924, the famous British climber, George Mallory, attempted to summit Mount Everest. In the end, the farthest point he reached was 800 feet away from the top. In 1960, the Chinese Mountaineering Team reached the top. We were viewed unfavorably by the whole world, but our final distance from the top... was zero feet. Mr. Fang, why do people climb mountains? Humans are destined to walk into the future, the deep ocean, the Himalayas, even outer space. Through the endless exploration of the unknown world, we march into the future. The mountains go into the sea as a direct result of the mighty force of geology. I collected this fossil from the summit. Professor. I've read some foreign literature. Why did mountaineers in the West refuse to acknowledge that your team reached the summit of Mount Everest? Did the Chinese really make it to the summit? Get to the top. Let the world see... the strength of the Chinese. Since that day, Fang Wuzhou never stepped into a classroom again. He no longer showed up at the library or even at our No Man's Land. He was nowhere to be found. The school has made arrangements. I've been selected to study abroad. I'm afraid I won't be back for several years. When are you leaving? Tomorrow. That's good. Meteorology in the Soviet Union is first-rate. When we made our summit, we didn't have a knowledgeable meteorologist. When you get there, take good care of yourself. Fang Wuzhou. You hide in the boiler room all day. Is this some kind of escape? What were you going to say to me that day at the factory? Mountaineering to me is heaven. But to ordinary people, it's like hell. So what? If there was a way to pull you out, I would do anything. What do you want? Stop lying! Fake hero! Come back! Who was that? Come out! Step up if you're so brave. Is it that hard to say it in the open? Coward! You're all cowards! Wuzhou, after I arrived in Moscow, I realized that the mountain you are trying to climb stands between the two of us. YEAR 1973 The country has decided to reassemble the National Mountaineering Team to reascend Mount Everest and conduct a comprehensive survey to measure Mount Everest's height. This feat will inspire all 800 million Chinese people. Fang Wuzhou, the National Mountaineering Team will be reassembled. After receiving this notification, please report to the team by 10 a.m. on March 13. XU YING WUZHOU, I'll BE BACK IN THE CITY BY 11 A.M. ON MARCH 13. SEE YOU! Hello. May I ask if Fang Wuzhou... He's gone. Where did he go? My brother! Sir, can I get a lift? My ride broke down. Where are you headed? What do you do? Captain? Coach Jiebu! What are you doing? Captain, my name is Li Guoliang. I am a news photographer with a mountaineering background. I received orders to report to you. A photographer with mountaineering experience? Drive. Captain Fang. Zhaxi, see to our friends from the Sports Bureau. Roger. Let's go. - Hei Mudan. - Yes. Greet our friends from the Mapping Agency and Sports Bureau. Okay. Come on. Let's go. Sports Bureau, over here. Welcome! Hello. Come this way. Follow him. Go on, catch up. Anybody from the Mapping Agency? Right here! I'll have a look. Why are you alone? Did you lose your group? I don't have a group. I'm the sunshine after the rain! My name is Yang Guang. Yang Guang? If you don't hurry, all the beds will be taken. - Go. - What's your name? Me? Hello, my name is Lin Jie. - Li Guoliang. - I'm Yang Guang. We're here to measure the altitude of Mount Everest. You? In 1960, the summit moment wasn't recorded because the camera was lost. This time, they chose me for the job. It's my honor. Like Mallory said, "Because it's there." Even Mallory, the king of mountaineering, died on Mount Everest. Aren't you scared? If I could go out like Mallory did and die on my way to the top, it would all be worth it. Go, team! You can do it! Go, team! You can do it! Go, team! Go! Go, team! Go, team! - Keep going! - Go, team! - Go, team! - Go, team! Who let you into my room? I am here to clean. Of course I have to come in. You're here to clean, not to play with my equipment. I want to learn photography. Can you teach me? Yes, of course I can teach you. You don't need to sneak around to do that. Maybe you should go. I'll teach you when I have time. Khugpa. What does that mean? What's khugpa? Khugpa means khugpa. Khugpa. Khugpa. Li Guoliang. Zhaxi, what does khugpa mean? That's Tibetan for "fool". They made persistent efforts and marched towards the main mountain... Captain, we are back. The watch post was observing the heroes' every move... Our mountaineering commander-in-chief, Marshal He Long said "We must leave Chinese footprints on Everest." We didn't let our country down. Let's have a drink! It was such a great pity. We didn't capture the moments of the heroes on top... Captain Fang, this one is for you. Thank you for saving my life back then. Cheers. One more. Captain Fang, this one is to you again. To you. I hate you. Songlin. There's something I've always wanted to ask you. What is it? When we were up on the mountain, if it were you, would you throw away the camera to keep your own life or die protecting the camera to save the evidence? I would die before I dropped the camera. Then how could you... How could you throw away the camera for me? Songlin. If it were you, would you let me die to save the camera? Would you choose to kill me? If there were a second chance, I would choose the camera over you. I would accomplish the mission and save the evidence! Then I would find you in the afterlife and stand by your side. I've been at this camp for 13 years. Every time I look up, I see that mountain we climbed. Do you have any idea how I've spent all these years? It is crucial to watch the banner cloud. In the Southern low trough, hidden pattern. Three days early, start observing. Nice weather, high pressure comes with. In the Northwest sky, cirrus clouds. It's coming now, the Southern low trough. Wait five days, your chance will come. To reach the summit, a high likelihood. Do you know what that is? That's the weather pattern for the entire Everest region. I recorded and memorized it over all these years. I recited it in reverse. If I had a second chance... Well, I won't have a second chance. There are no ifs. That's pointless! This time, we will successfully summit the mountain! This time... I don't care how you do it. We can't afford a single mistake. We stick to my orders. Captain Fang, if the mission fails you'll be the one to explain it to our late captain! Wait! Songlin! You all know who the three of us are. But who are you? Sorry, I have no idea. But I believe, after you successfully reach that summit, every person in China, every person in the entire world will know who you are! Do you feel confident? - Yes, sir! - Yes, sir! Good! Why do we climb? We are the mountaineering team. Be serious. Because I want to be a climber like Captain Fang! Do you want to say something? Give him a round of applause! Now, let's take a look at the topography of Everest. Here is the Everest Base Camp we'll be stationed at after we're through with training. Altitude of 5,120 meters. After an 8.2km walk towards the northwest we'll reach the ice seracs. When passing through the seracs, do not stray from the path because there are many crevasses concealed by snow. Up next is the snow slope of the North Col. Before we arrive here, we put on our crampons. The slope is 7,028 meters tall with a maximum incline exceeding 70 degrees. This section is the most dangerous avalanche zone. All crew members must refrain from shouting. Moving forward is the well-known Windy Gap. In high winds, you could be blown several kilometers off course. Here is the steep and icy Second Step. In May 1960, our captain, Fang Wuzhou, squatted down at the base of the Step and used himself as a human ladder. That's how we scaled the Second Step. This is also where Qu Songlin got frostbite on his feet. He lost half his foot. Captain Fang, is there a time window for the summit? Absolutely. The ideal time window arrives around May each year. Since the weather is always changing, the window's duration is unpredictable. That is why we must begin our ascent as soon as the window opens. Once the window closes, all will be in vain. Get up! Faster! One minute is up! Sir! Sir! First group out. Second group up. First group, right face! Li Guoliang, step aside. Start running! Still ten seconds to go, but you said one minute was up. Halt! Left face! - Zhaxi, step aside. - Yes, sir! Li Guoliang, fill in. Get ready. Start the time! Li Guoliang, get up! Li Guoliang, you were ten seconds short just now. Make up for it. Ten, nine, eight... Guoliang. Li Guoliang, get ready to go again with the third group. Songlin, that's about enough. He could get injured. He's fine. He can keep going. Give them some time to adjust. We didn't meet the standard this quickly in the Soviet Union. - Haste makes waste. - I will say this again. Songlin. Hold your breath for one minute. Complete six obstacles in two minutes. Three minutes in total. Everybody must meet the standard. If you can't do it, you can go home. Any objections, say it now. I'll put you in a car and send you home immediately. Is that clear? Is that clear? - Yes, sir! - Yes, sir! Three minutes is impossible. Exactly. What did you just say? Sir, nobody can complete the course in three minutes! Go! - Go, Captain Fang! - Go! - Go, Captain Fang! - Go! - Go, Captain Fang! - Captain Fang! - Keep going! - Go, Captain Fang! - Go, Captain Fang! - Captain Fang! Keep going! Fifty seconds. One minute and fifty seconds. Captain Fang, time's up. Two minutes and twenty seconds. Two minutes and thirty seconds. - He did it! - Well done! Well done! Two minutes and thirty seconds. I... It was my fault today. I've been making so much trouble for you. But I won't anymore. Do you still want to learn photography? I can teach you. I might not meet the coach's standard. If you learn how to take photos, you can take my place. In Tibet, the mountain, sea, and land are all our mothers. Mother will always bless us. Mother will always bless us. She will always show us tolerance. We are always in her embrace. We will never leave it. We are heading up Lhakpa Ri soon. You two, get yourselves in order! Coach Qu. Why are you singling me out? In 1960, we reached the summit. But because we lost the camera, we brought shame to all of China. Now we are starting fresh again. The camera is the most important thing and you are the one who carries it. Do you want it to be lost again? Do you want China to face another decade of shame? You're all right. You're pretty good at everything. But you are not here to entertain the girls! I am not picking on you. I value you on the team. Lhakpa Ri is 7,018 meters above sea level Its topography is similar to Everest below 7,000 meters. That's why climbers use Lhakpa Ri to acclimatize and train. If we are lucky, we might even see Everest at the top. There are many crevasses around here. If you don't want to die, follow my footsteps. We are here. - We are here. - We made it! - Where is Everest? - Where is Everest? It's too foggy to see anything. I thought we would see it. - Look! There it is! - Everest! It's right there. - I see it! - Everest! Our ascent training is complete. We must return the way we came. Watch out for the crevasses. - Yes, Captain! - Yes, Captain! Avalanche! Run! It's not an avalanche! - Stop them! - Run! Hurry! - Hold on! - Yes, sir! Stop running! Li Guoliang, I'm coming! Don't come! The captain says it's not an avalanche! Why are you all panicking? I told you to stay put! I am still breathing. Are you okay? What's wrong? My foot! My foot! Wang Yuanchao. Respiratory rate, 28. Pulse, 85. Blood pressure, 140 over 80. Move your right leg. Try again. Does this hurt? Bone fracture. Give him a splint - and send him to Lhasa Military Hospital. - Okay. Next is Yang Guang. - Where are you hurt? - Same as him. Relax. Take it easy. Is this okay? Relax. Relax, don't tense up. Get up and try walking. I can walk? Yes, stand up and walk. Bursitis, collateral ligament injury. Apply an ice compress. Take aspirin three times a day, 650mg per dose. Apply anti-inflammatory ointment four times a day. The pain seems to be gone. You will be fine in a week. Thank you, Dr. Zhao. Captain Fang, your team's goal is to climb Mount Everest, not end up in my hospital beds. As approved by the State Council, the Everest Summiting and the Joint Scientific Expedition officially begins now! I have been appointed commander-in-chief for this expedition. Qu Songlin is deputy commander. Fang Wuzhou is the Ascent Team captain. Jiebu is the Support Team leader. MT. EVEREST BASE CAMP MT. EVEREST BASE CAMP 5,120 METERS -1.7 DEGREES CELSIUS, 4.3M/S WIND SPEED, 12.78 PERCENT OXYGEN Check your equipment again. Make sure you have everything. - What are you up to, Lin Jie? - Yang Guang. This is the surveyor's beacon I told you about. The whole thing is over three meters tall. It looks heavy. - Are you carrying it? - Yes. My mission is to place it on the summit. Yang Guang, can you believe it? Our measurement will rewrite history. How so? Outside China, the mountain is known as Mount Everest because the current official height was measured by a British man. After 1949, we officially named the highest peak of the Himalayas Qomolangma. In Tibetan, it means The Third Goddess. So this time, we must measure the accurate altitude. - China's official measurement. - Yes. China's official measurement. - One, two, three, four. - One, two, three, four. Master. Please pray for our good fortune in summiting. Mount Qomolangma is a sacred mountain. You cannot go up there. But so many people have gone before. The goddess was merciful. But she can also be cruel. Qomolangma is our goddess. Her khata is like cooking smoke. He means to say that the khata of the goddess is the mountain's banner cloud. Banner cloud? This banner cloud is the highest wind indicator in the world. - He also said that the goddess dances. - He did! It's exactly what our meteorology department has been researching. When the goddess changes her dance, does it... Does it indicate different weather conditions? Have you heard of the Verkhoyansk Mountains? It's said to be the coldest place on earth. Temperatures can reach as low as -70 degrees Celsius. Two winters ago, we went there on an expedition. I caught a fever. I was unconscious for five days. The moment... I woke up... My teacher and classmates kept asking me, "Who is Fang Wuzhou?" They said, while I was in a coma... I kept calling out your name. Ying, there is so much I want to say to you. But I don't know where to begin. I want to wait until after this mission-- Thank you for everything. I hope that we can work together smoothly in the days to come. Captain Fang. Xu Ying, head of the Meteorology Team, is officially reporting to you. My job is to provide meteorological data and assist the Ascent Team in reaching the summit. That is all. Ying. MEDICAL TEAM I have everybody's family medical reports. What's wrong? Is there a problem with my health? Your father died of Marfan syndrome. It can be hereditary. But I don't have it. All my medical reports can prove that. I advise you not to climb Everest. All the other doctors said I am fine. Why are you the only one who says I'm not fit? I understand how you feel. But even the slightest chance of illness is a glaring red flag to me. I understand. My dad only found out he had this disorder after I was born. He regretted bringing me into this world. I've always wanted to tell him this. "Dad, I'm fine. You shouldn't regret anything." Everest is the closest place to heaven. I hoped he would see me at the top and be proud of me. Friends, we come from different places and from different walks of life. We must carry on the spirit of tenacity and bravery in the face of death. We must succeed and place the national flag on the summit of Everest! We may fail. We may face an avalanche or a big storm. But we will give it everything we have to reach the summit. Support Team, go on ahead to 6,300 meters altitude and set up ladders between the crevasses. One, two, three! One, two, three! One, two, release! SERAC FOREST 5,800 METERS -6 DEGREES CELSIUS, 7.1M/S WIND SPEED, 10.85 PERCENT OXYGEN Base Camp, do you read? Base Camp. Go ahead. We have reached the ice seracs. Estimated arrival at Advance Base Camp at 17:00. Excellent. The weather is the same as the forecast. Copy that. Base Camp? Go ahead. We have reached the crevasses. How's your end? Everything is all right over here. Jiebu? Base Camp, Captain Fang, we've reached the North Col's ice wall. Estimated arrival at the top of North Col at 16:00. Impressive! One hour earlier than estimated. Good job! Come on. ADVANCE BASE CAMP 6,500 METERS -14 DEGREES CELSIUS, 9.3M/S WIND SPEED, 11.35 PERCENT OXYGEN - Liu Bin. - Yes. Base Camp, Ascent Team is leaving for North Col Camp Estimated arrival at 15:00. The meteorologists will stay at Advance Base Camp as planned. - Base Camp, copy. - Jiebu, copy. Support Team is already at North Col Camp and making preparations. We will be waiting for you here. Ascent Team, copy! - Move out! - Yes, sir! THE NORTH COL 6,700 METERS -20 DEGREES CELSIUS, 18M/S WIND SPEED, 9.75 PERCENT OXYGEN Command Center, this is Xu Ying from the Meteorology Team. Weather conditions look different from the forecast. Our observations indicate the wind will grow much stronger. Please alert the Ascent Team. NORTH COL CAMP 7,028 METERS -18 DEGREES CELSIUS, 10.4M/S WIND SPEED, 9.75 PERCENT OXYGEN - Give it to me. - Don't worry about me! I need two people to help him to the tent. Give him some hot water. C2 ADVANCE CAMP 7,500 METERS -25 DEGREES CELSIUS, 28.2M/S WIND SPEED, 9.35 PERCENT OXYGEN - Barometric pressure? -420 hPa. Give me the radio. Command, do you read me? Command, roger. Go ahead. I have been monitoring the upper air data. It indicates that the weather system is speeding up. That means the ideal window we predicted for ascent has already passed! Also, the Ascent Team might soon be facing a level ten storm or higher! It's off by so much. What happened to your forecast? We've been monitoring changes in the weather and simultaneously updating the forecast. Please abort the summit attempt immediately. We don't have the right to abort this mission. We were assigned to this expedition to ensure the climbers' safety. I looked at the data as well. Once they make it past the Windy Gap, everything should be fine. Ascent Team, proceed as planned. Keep moving forward. Copy that. Fang Wuzhou, don't be impulsive! Ascent Team will proceed as told. If the weather is really as bad as you say, we will retreat immediately. Director, winds at Ascent Camp are approaching level ten! ATTACK CAMP 8,300 METERS -30 DEGREES CELSIUS, 29.2M/S WIND SPEED, 5.67 PERCENT OXYGEN We've lost contact with the Ascent Team. Set up the tents! Keep yourselves warm! - Yes, sir! - Yes, sir! Dr. Zhao, someone just threw up. Please go and check on him. I'll be right there. Dr. Zhao! Dr. Zhao. I'm sorry! Dr. Zhao. Lie down! Lin Jie! - Tie the ladders together. - Yes, Captain! - Buckle up. - Yes, sir! Hold onto the ladder. Li Guoliang, throw the rope to me! Yes, sir! Captain! Yang Guang. I'm fine! - Yang Guang! - Yang Guang! Captain Fang of Ascent Team, report in. Captain Fang of Ascent Team, report in. Pick up the pace! We're almost there. Captain Fang of Ascent Team, report in. Captain! It's Base Camp. Captain Fang of Ascent Team, please respond. Base Camp, we hit a storm. Yang Guang was injured. We are in an emergency retreat. Is... Is Xu Ying with you as well? No! The Meteorology Team was probably left behind in retreat. We've been trying to reach them, but we've lost contact. Where was she at last contact? She said her team was retreating from Advance Base Camp. Xu Ying! Xu Ying! Quiet. Xu Ying! - Xu Ying! - Wuzhou! - Wuzhou! - Xu Ying! Fang Wuzhou! - Fang Wuzhou! - Xu Ying! Don't move! Pull her out! Get her out of here! Wuzhou. - Director! - Wuzhou! Wuzhou! Be careful, Wuzhou. Wuzhou. I'm going to lose my right leg, aren't I? I won't be able to run, but I'll still be able to hop. I won't give up. I will return to summit Everest. I made a promise to myself. I want to tell him in person. Dad... I made it. Captain, I am hereby requesting... Requesting to be appointed captain of the second summit attempt. I am against it. Captain, you are injured. The last window of opportunity for the year is almost here. If we don't go now, we will have sacrificed for nothing. You aren't experienced enough. There are many emergencies you won't be able to handle. You're not ready to lead the team. You've taught us everything we need to know. Here is our plan. May 7, 6 a.m., all members will set out from Base Camp and reach Advance Base Camp before nightfall. On May 8, planned departure at 4:30 a.m. After reaching North Col Camp, we take a short break before heading straight to Ascent Camp. We're going to complete a 2-day journey in 18 hours. The night before, we will have a full night's rest to be ready for the next day's summiting. Coach Jiebu, please provide us with backup. Before we reach the Second Step, I will lead a group of eight to scout the path ahead. Only when it's absolutely safe will I have the entire team attempt the summit. Have you been above 8,300 meters? Do you know the last few hundred meters are the deadliest? Have you been in an avalanche? It moves at over 100km per hour and can go on for minutes. Whether you live or die is determined in a matter of seconds. At best, our forecast can only be predicted four hours in advance. Captain, back when you made your ascent, your old captain was injured. You took over and led the team in accomplishing the mission. Aren't we in the same situation? Last night, a few of us young ones wrote a letter of resolution. Captain, if we keep living under your wing without experiencing real hardships or overcoming obstacles, how can we carry on the torch when you're gone? Your generation has always shouldered the fate of the country. When will it be our turn? Absolutely not. I don't agree with this plan. I am the deputy commander. Hold on to that camera. Take a 360-degree photo at the top and prove to the world that the Chinese can reach their own summit again. From this moment on... Captain Li Guoliang, you are the eyes for the world. I will accomplish the mission!

Base Camp sends its regards. Keep the troops moving forward and ascend the Second Step as soon as possible. Captain Li, we've detected shifting wind currents. Strong winds might soon appear at the Windy Gap. Be extra careful climbing the Second Step. Copy, Director Xu. Captain Li Guoliang, this is Fang Wuzhou. I advise you to stay put for 30 minutes. Avoid the high winds and set out again after resting. Roger that, Captain. Captain Li Guoliang, this is Qu Songlin. I recommend you ascend the Second Step before the high winds set in. Songlin, I suggest taking it slow. Captain Li Guoliang, follow my order. Their lives are at stake! - We're moving on! - Yes, Captain!

We've reached the rock wall of the Second Step. I think we dodged the wind. We're about to set up the ladders to the top! They're about to reach the top! Captain Li! China eagerly awaits news of your victory. Roger that, Base Camp! Look here! Let's go! To the top! Watch out! Hook in!! Now! Captain! Is Guoliang okay? Pull him up! Captain, wake up! Li Guoliang! Li Guoliang, wake up! Pull harder! - We mustn't slide farther down! - I can't hold on much longer! Li Guoliang! Captain, give me your hand! Give me your hand now! I can't hold on much longer! Keep going forward! No! MT. EVEREST BASE CAMP Captain! I was wrong. I was wrong about everything. My brother. HEI MUDAN HEI MUDAN Everyone, stop. The officials have decided to abort this year's summit attempt. Everyone is to leave Base Camp. Weather forecasts indicate that our window has passed. There's a storm coming. Get going. Can you all give us a moment? Wuzhou. It's right there. I've waited for 15 years. Wuzhou. Just give me a minute. Either way... I believe in you. You will make it to the top again and make China proud once more. Make it to the top again? That's easy to say. If I were you, I would prepare for the next window of opportunity. What did you say? What did you just say? Next window? What next window? Captain Fang, we've been observing for four consecutive days, over 96 hours in total. Our analysis shows that atmospheric pressure between 6,000 meters and 9,000 meters is decreasing rapidly. After the storm, in about three days, weather conditions will drastically improve. So? So, we might have a brief window. That's my girl! But we've already announced the mission was aborted. If we say there is another window and insist on staying, we will have to take full responsibility. I know that you can handle this pressure. It's been 15 years. Ying, nobody is as good to me as you are. Nobody is as beautiful as you. I hope you are right. But what if you are wrong? The Central Meteorology Bureau already said the window has passed. If we insist on going forward, we will be putting lives at stake. Do you understand? I absolutely agree that the climbers' safety must be ensured. But please take a closer look at my report. We've been monitoring the wind speed at altitudes above 8,000 meters for 75 days straight. Nobody knows better than we do. I was born in these mountains and have lived here for decades. Doesn't that make my opinion more valuable? With the weather like this, how can there be a good window ahead? I'll have you know that good weather on Everest is like a newlywed girl on a horse. When that horse rides out, she'll be gone forever. The data from Base Camp and upper air circulation patterns both indicate that there will be another window. Just look at my report. In the immediate future, there will be a westerly wind coming. We'll have to climb up against it and attempt the summit as it is passing so that we can catch the good weather when the high-pressure ridge is here. In other words, sometime in three days, our best chance at the summit will be here. Xu Ying, can you be more specific? What time exactly, three days from now? I cannot. Not from Base Camp. But the closer we are to Ascent Team, the more accurate I can be. Which one of you meteorologists has experience climbing in extreme weather? Commander-in-chief. I request that Meteorology Team set out with Ascent Team. When Ascent Team reaches the Second Step, they can stand by. As soon as we see that it's safe to summit, we will inform them immediately. - We can provide them with real-time data. - Hold on, Xu Ying. In the past, if you told me the window was gone, even with 10,000 men holding me back, I would still try it. But now I know that responsibility is heavier than this mountain. I'm sure you know what I mean. Is the debate over? Fang Wuzhou? What's your input? I believe in Xu Ying. Because I believe in science. What's their current altitude? They're at 6,700 meters. Temperature? -20 degrees Celsius. Wind speed, 17m/s. Base Camp, wind speed of 17m/s at North Col picking up to 17.2m/s to 20.7m/s at night Ascent Team must find shelter from the wind at North Col. How much has the temperature dropped? It has dropped 7 degrees in less than 2 hours. Base Camp, do you read me? This is Base Camp. Atmospheric pressure is extremely unstable. Glacier winds could exceed level eight at any moment. Ascent Team? Ascent Team, report in! Captain, the signal is unstable. We have no instruction. Do we keep going? That sound... Something is wrong. Director, hurry back into the tent. Your cough is getting worse. Shit. Retreat! - Avalanche! Retreat! - Go! - Fall back! - Go! Everybody, look! Wuzhou, report in. Wuzhou! Jiebu! Wuzhou, please respond if you hear this! The rope! Now! Hurry! - Give me the beacon. - Okay. - Pull him over. - Yes, sir! One, two, three! One, two, three! Fang Wuzhou, please respond! Jiebu, do you copy? Zhaxi? Hei Mudan? Ascent Team, does anybody copy? Please respond if you hear this! Fang Wuzhou! Fang Wuzhou! - Over here! - Hurry! - Captain! - Hurry! Captain! - Captain! - Hurry! - Captain! - Pull him out! - One, two, three! - One, two, three! - One, two, three! - One, two, three! Fang Wuzhou! Fang Wuzhou, please respond! Captain! - Wake up, Captain! - Captain! Jiebu! Xu Ying. Jiebu. Why are you crying? Don't you dare cry! Where is Fang Wuzhou? What happened? What happened to him? - Captain! - Captain! Ying. Ying. Wu... Wuzhou! Are you okay? I was... I was resting just now. Wuzhou, you must return safe and sound. I am still waiting to hear you say it. Ying, I just had a dream... about that factory again. That Fang Wuzhou! How could he take a rest at a time like this? Wind speed, 34m/s. - Director! - Director! - Director! - Director! You must head back now. Help her inside. - But I still need to monitor - Careful. - The atmospheric pressure. - Don't worry. Wind direction, northwest. - Wind speed? - Wind speed, 21m/s. The radio is still not responding. There is too much interference from the weather. Based on the data we just received, the weather is still very unstable. Just this morning, the wind has exceeded level eight. We must wait until the afternoon to attempt the summit. So you are saying, when they reach the Second Step, they will face the worst snowstorm. They must avoid it to stand a chance. Captain, we have a signal. Base Camp! Ascent Team. Without my instruction... Xu Ying? Don't go up there. What are you saying? I can't hear a thing! Xu Ying? Without weather data, what do we do? Keep going. Meteorology Team to Ascent Team. Ascent Team? Captain Fang, do you copy? Ascent Team? We need to head up. SECOND STEP 8,680 METERS -33 DEGREES CELSIUS, 28.3M/S WIND SPEED, 5.35 PERCENT OXYGEN Calling Base Camp. Calling Meteorology Team. Captain, there's a signal from the Meteorology Team. Ying, is that you? It's me. How am I getting your signal here? Wuzhou. - Ying? - Where are you? We are at the Second Step. We're getting ready to set up the ladders to climb the Step. No, you can't. Stay where you are. The winds are at their strongest right now. The wind speed will exceed level ten. If you attempt the summit, you will all be blown away. You mustn't. Copy that. Xu Ying? - Director! - Director! Stay put for now. The time to summit is coming soon. Ying, why are you coughing? Captain Fang, she has difficulty breathing. She coughed up a lot of blood! It's pulmonary edema! Sit her upright and get her some oxygen! Give her plenty of hot water! We still can't reach the Meteorology Team. They aren't at their original location. Where are you? We are at the North Col. What? Who told you to climb up? I did. I asked them to come up here. Don't blame them. You are in grave danger. Wuzhou, I have something to tell you. All right, let's talk. I'm so glad that I could be here with you. The mountain between us has vanished. Thank you for showing me. Now we can say those words we never said before. My mission is over. It's now time for you to fulfill your dream. Fang Wuzhou... You can do it. I am so proud of you. Ying! Ying! I want to tell you something. I want to... I want to marry you. I want to marry you right now. Wait for me. You must! You have to wait for me! - Director! - Director! Ying! - Director! - Director! - Ying! - Director! Ying! Ying! Ying! Ying! Xu Ying said... We can make our summit now. Go. One, two, three! Base Camp. Base Camp. This is Base Camp. Go ahead. Please speak. Reporting to Base Camp. Reporting to Beijing. Reporting to China. It is now 14:30 on May 27, 1975. Nine members of the Chinese Mountaineering Team made it to the summit. Well done! Good job! Congratulations from Base Camp for reaching the summit! Set up the beacon immediately! Raise the beacon! Guoliang, do you see this? The target will soon appear. - Point positions prepare for intersection. - Triangulation positions in place. East point, be ready. Wait for the beacon. Take that flag and raise it high. Yes, sir! Commander-in-chief! Measurement of Mount Qomolangma complete! ON JULY 23, 1975, CHINA ANNOUNCED TO THE WORLD THE NEW ALTITUDE OF MOUNT QOMOLANGMA AS 8,848.13 METERS. YEAR 2019, MT. EVEREST BASE CAMP Sir, thank you for accepting our interview. There were over 400 people in the 1975 climbing and expedition team. In the end, only nine of us made it to the summit. I got injured that year. I wasn't able to go along and fulfill my dream. But I made a promise to myself and my teammates. I would return and climb it again.
