Mosca! That watch of yours is a bit homo. When I have money, I'll get two gold ones. Mosca, hurry up! Mosca! Stop! Stop! Hi, Benito! - Gimme a kiss! - What are you doing here? - I missed you. - You saw me last night. - You saw me last night. - That was 5 years ago. - I love you, I love you. - Come on, Benito! I'm coming! Shit! Let's go! Come on, Mosca! Know what I'll do when I'm rich? Put up a building that'll grow like a prick. I'll call it the "Gonzalez Tower". Let's go. Forget about buildings. I wanna... screw. There'll be a massage parlor, you can get laid too. - We need more concrete. - We'll go to the Captain's. Mosca! I've never known anyone like Rita. Well, she doesn't seem so great to me. That's because she's your sister. - I'm gonna take her to Spain. - What about the bidets? Are you listening to me? Shit! How the hell would I know? I'm in love. No need to tell me. I can see that. You're a bit fatter. How much do you weigh? 94 pounds, I gained two. Get another one. Come on, baby. - Or the love of a woman - Gimme a little candy. I gave all I was, life's most beautiful part. But the time that I lost will not always be wasted when my wound finally heals. It still seems as if everything were a dream but I know that some day there'll come a time when I'll forget. Today I may feel sad, but soon I'll sing again and I promise not to ever think about yesterday. - The light bothers me. - I like looking at you. I love you, I love you. I want to marry you. You'll quit that shitty bar. Come here, sit down. Like they do. I've got projects. I'll make money. - How? - Houses, villas, buildings. That's my bag, to build, erect... get a hard on! Pipe down, I can't concentrate. Come to Spain with me. You'll have a bathroom with your own bidet. That'd be great. A bathroom and a bidet just for me. Don't lose that smell. Don't ever lose that smell. Gimme a hand! Benito! Come on! Come on! - Come on, Rita! - We'll be in trouble. Mosca! Mosca! See you! - Let's go. - Yeah. Come on! Here! Here! Over here! 94 pounds! Wait for me! Wait for me! Get her. What's up, Rita? What's up? - Water time! - Water time! You'll have your own lobster tank. You're shaking. - I'm cold. - Here. Thanks. Shall we go? - We gotta get the concrete. - I feel awful. Take Rita to work. I'll go on my own. Alright. I'll see you at the barracks. I wanna marry your sister. What about you? You'll come to Spain with me? I'd like that. What's up? Where have you been all night? Here and there. - We gotta talk. - Go ahead. Alone. Come here. What is it? - I don't know what to say. - What about? I'm sorry. What is it? Rita and I... I'm in love with Rita. That's impossible. - Why not? - That's impossible. Rita loves me. - No, she loves me. - She loves me, Miguel. She loves me. You son of a bitch! Goddamn son of a bitch! - How could you? - Let go! Lay off! What are you doing? Go away, Miguel. I'll kill him! - I said lay off! - Bastard! Watch out. I'll kill you. - Let go, Miguel, come back! - Calm down! Tell me you love me! Tell me! - You've talked to Miguel? - Yeah. Let's get outta here. You'll do as I say. And I said we go. How the fuck can you love Miguel? You're a whore. You've fucked me, alright. But I'll fuck you. Gimme your panties, now! Give them to me! Shut up and hand them over! Now you're just a whore to me. Kiss me. Hi, Mosca. I don't like the way we do things. What's wrong? We got the best lot, we'll start building soon. I wonder if you ever stop and think a little. We haven't got permits, money, anything. You've hired people. How will you pay them? - Maybe they got kids to feed. - Drop it, Mosca. I just need money and a bank. A bank will give me a loan. I'll lay it all on the table. Fuck, we'll soon be going up. You need a partner to guarantee the operation. Buying an office and selling a few apartments... isn't enough to get a loan... to build a forty story building. Fifty story. - Marta. - Hello. - This is Marta, my daughter. - It's a pleasure. Benito Gonzalez. Marta did her Master in Chicago. She works with me. I'll do business in the States soon. The coffee's awful. Well, Benito... As I told you, find someone to back you up. Come back and see me then. We need a big fish. Yeah, we're more like this kind. Look at her. A hot number. When I see that, I get like a lobster. Either they tie me up or I claw it all up. Look, man, what a doll. What a piece of ass! Look, what's she doing with the paella pan? She's nuts. So, you're a model? - Who told you? - A little birdie. And when you grow up? - An actress. - An actress? That's nice. What's your name? Claudia. Claudita. - And you? - Benito. - What weird paintings. - That? That's art. When I'm rolling in dough, I'll buy Dalis. And I'll have a lobster tank at home. If I were an artist, I'd be like Dali. That guy did what he fucking wanted. Want me to tie you up? You're nuts. Come here. Relax. Come here. There. Relax. Relax, damn it. - Come on, relax. - I can't if you talk. Listen, baby, I don't have much time. Or the love of a woman... Want to be my secretary? Your secretary? What would I do? Or the love of a woman I gave all I was... No, don't touch my breasts. I don't want them to get deformed. Do you mind if I speak? I don't. But you could shut up a little. Show me your armpit. I don't want you to screw anyone else. You jealous? I just love jealous men. I'll brand your hand to know you're mine. A star. Lovely! I've got an important lunch tomorrow, want to come? Hey! You take me for a slut? If you were, you wouldn't be here. The Gonzalez Tower will have a heliport... the biggest mall in the country... a mini-golf course. And well, maybe a massage parlor. The golf course was my idea. Lovely. It's a gift. Always be generous with women and politicians. I want you to be in the project. Sure! I put up the money and you start building. Fucking great! Give me a toothpick. What about your share of the dough? Where is it? - Do you take me for an ass? - A bank is backing me. You want to do business? Don't carry that purse. Dress a little better. Next... brush up your style, be aggressive. Last, don't ever try to fool me. If you do, I'll drown you in shit. Spaniards have a lousy temper. Know why? Chick-peas. They make you bad tempered and I just love them. I suppose you got all the permits? - Certainly. - That's it then. Get your share of the dough and we'll talk. I'm gonna smoke cigars. Gil's cool, real interesting. Some day I'll know as much as he does. Fuck, I just want to build the city's tallest tower... and a house from where I can see it. Will I be there too? I think I'm in love with you. How will I get the money? I can only clear it. I need money to raise it. Make a project of the Gonzalez Tower. A scale-model, something spectacular. My building's balls will be here. Starting from now... things are gonna change. - Do you want it? - Alright. For you. You draw well. - You like me like that? - I love it. Sex is imagination. It's art, fantasy, culture. - Sculpture? - Culture, culture. You're tickling me. People are always going on about sex but don't get it. Sex is art! Fantasy! A good nude is the best... like this. Not my breasts. Not my breasts. - How much do you weigh? - Me? 112 pounds. For me... for my structure, the ideal weight is 94 pounds. I move better. And you think I'm too fat, right? - Where are you going? - To get washed. Why? I like your smell. Come back. You remind me of a little slut... I knew in Melilla who hurt me real bad. Don't worry. I know what's got to smell and what doesn't. Know why I like to wash? For this. And this. Last time someone did that to me... I fell in love. Me too. Not there. Not there. Lower down. I need you to do me a favor. Screw a banker. What are you looking for? I want to give you something. My Rolex. Like it? I'd prefer a gold one. I'll buy you one when I get enough dough. Listen, this country's shit. In the States, I'll do big things. Americans know how to do things right. They sure do. You got to screw a banker. Please, Claudia. If he fondles my breasts... what then? Think of America. Miami... You're ambitious. You have no capital but you present the project. I'm waiting for you to help me. I wanted to show you I meant it. Back me up and I'll give you everything. I know you'll never give me everything. Excuse me. Come here. That's Folch, the banker I told you about. Don't look. Look. Look. That's you. Take it. I bet he likes you. Make him happy and I'll get my money. You said I had to be yours only... and now you want me to screw him. Sex is natural. Anything that's natural can't be bad. Not a bad display, but this isn't serious. I wonder if the banker will go for it. Business and creativity go together. You know how to choose the chorizo. Damn good. - You like it? - Careful with my suit. I'll say it again. Get your half and we're in business. It won't take long, believe me. How did it go? Did you convince him? Sorry, nothing doing. He's very nice. - I even liked being with him. - What? He's a nice guy... but nobody's going to convince him. - What's wrong? - Let me be! - Jealous? - How the fuck would I know? What a lovely horse! It's made of sand. I wish I had as much money as that horse grains of sand. Each grain a 5,000 peseta bill. One leg would be enough. One ear would buy me a gold Rolex. If you couldn't... how the fuck can I convince him? You could marry his daughter. Nobody can convince that guy, believe me. Claudita... that's the brightest idea you'll ever have. For better or worse... in sickness and in health to love and to honor... till death do you apart? I do. Marta, take this ring... as a token of my love and fidelity. Benito, take this ring... as a token of my love and fidelity. Chicago was too much. When I was there... my boyfriend worked in Design and Construction... next to the Sears Tower, the world's tallest building. America's great! Everything moves there. Know something? I never believed I'd marry you. I thought passion didn't exist. Live and learn. Know why I like you? You're featherweight. You weigh less than 90 pounds. I love you. What's so funny? What is it? How can I be in love with someone... who likes Julio Iglesias... and who's called Benito? Mind if I touch them? No, why should I mind? Go away, Bush, scram. Bush. Get lost, kid! Get off! Get lost! Mosca! No kids around here! Get away from here! We're gonna make it. Benito... look who's coming. I told her not to. She got here yesterday. You're looking good. My brother told me you're successful. I can't complain. How's Miguel? The bank closed the bar down. I asked for a loan, but they refused. I need money. Know what I feel like? Some candy. Remember? My only woman. It will be the city's tallest building. Come here. Come on, don't be scared. Here's the tower's tallest spot. Know how I got that far? With my balls. Here. Rita, Rita, Rita. - What are you looking at? - Your armpits. I can't forget your smell. Raise your arms. Raise your arms. - I don't know why I came. - For money. Tell me you love me. What are you doing? Turn around, take your panties off. Let me be. If you want money, take off your panties. - You've gained weight. - Pig. Come here. Claudita! What's wrong? Didn't you like my flowers? Here's what I think of your flowers! These are Monday's! Tuesday's! Wednesday's! I hate them! I hate your damn flowers! You think a few flowers and a shitty room are enough! But... You think it's a "good investment"! - What's wrong, baby? - I hate them! Know why? Every time I get flowers... it means you won't be coming. I've told you, Claudita. I married her for money, she's an investment. Try to understand. I love you. - I love only you. - I can't take it anymore. You can stuff your flowers! - Who gave you that ring? - Let go. - Who? Tell me. - You wear one too. Who is it? You put me in bed with him. Great. Why promise me so much when I asked nothing? I only wanted you. I'd even have given you my breasts. Come here. - Let me smell you. - Go away, let me be. Let me smell you, I like it so much. Coming to smell me would have been enough. Kiss me. Kiss me. - I can't take it any more. - Sure you can. It's very late. I was starting to worry. Sorry, dinner went on forever. Your dinners always go on forever. Come here. Where have you been? - Let me fondle your breasts. - What? Don't touch me. Try not to slurp for once. Sorry, I know I have no manners. Don't you think you could take it down? I rather like it. Marta, you've punished me enough. My father never believed we'd last long. Forget your father. I'm up to here with his morals and his bank. And his daughter. Stop whining, Marta. We went to an all-male joint... and we bet on who'd get the bra. I did. Don't cry. I can't. You must tell me everything. Who were you with? This has been going on for hours. I'm sorry. I can't stand it. Are you in love with her? I don't know. How can you tell me we may have to stop building? Didn't Garcia solve it? Sure he did, but what about the beams? Don't mention the fucking beams, you hear? Pay the town hall's guys or whoever you feel like. We can't stop. What would happen if Gil backed out? I'll do whatever I can but I wonder... - What about the Alfas lot? - I'm meeting the owner. - At what time? - Five p.m. Alright. Miguel, how is it going? How are you? - What do you think? - What do I think? Aren't you pleased? I give you a job and you don't like it. Things have changed, I move in another sphere. What do you expect? What can you do? All you care about is screwing and drinking. If you don't like it you can leave. Who's that? The pimp of a whore I met in Melilla. Wait, I can't open. No, not my breasts. What the hell? Get out. I'm sick and tired of you, of waiting for you... of not showering, of your damn tower. I can go out with whoever I feel like. One. Do that bra trick again and I'll kill you. Two. Anyone but him. Three. No one because you're mine, Claudia, mine. Shit. Fuck. - I feel so lonely. - I know, I know. I feel so lonely. Now, now. - She's asleep. - So what? She's asleep. Caress her. Benito, you're home. What time is it? Kiss her there, on the neck. Come back to bed! Marta, come back! - Why, why? - Come back to bed, Marta! - Why do you do this to me? - Marta. Marta... don't get upset, I'm doing it for you. Open up! Christ. Marta, open up. You expect me to screw... with your wife crying in the bathroom? Go! Get away from here! I'm sorry. I didn't know I had to do what I did. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, it wasn't my fault. He fooled me. I know it's not your fault. He's a pig. And a crook. For years... he's been telling me he'd make me famous. So far, I've only done two spots. One for panties and another for cheese. The cheese one turned out real well. I'll show it to you. He didn't even tell me. He's such a pig. A son of a bitch. A selfish bastard. A selfish dirty pig. And a lout. How can I bear this music? Well, I just love Julio Iglesias. Come to think about it, he isn't so bad. For the love of a woman who loved another man. For the love of a woman... I gave all I was... life's most beautiful part. But the time that I lost... will not always be wasted. He's weird. Look. What's so funny? Look. Wow! You too? A time when I'll forget. Today I may feel sad... but soon I'll sing again... and I promise... not to ever think about yesterday. You feel a little better, don't you? Thanks. Know what he made me do at first? The worst part is that I liked it. What? He made me go to bed with his clients. Not me... but I'd have liked that. But the time that I lost... will not always be wasted... when my wound finally heals. It still seems... What's going on? Why the fuck are you here? Come on... I'll take you home. She'll stay here tonight, she doesn't feel well. Why not get divorced? You marry her... I take her place... and you screw me twice a week. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about what happened. I really am. Your hair doesn't grow either? - Very little. - Too bad. - Are your boxes smaller? - No, they're the same. - Know what I'd like? - What? To have two pricks. Marta... you got a gold Rolex too? I have one too... but it isn't gold. Shut up. Let her speak. Marta? I have a meeting with the Belgian guy. Is my cream shirt ironed? Can't you hear me? - Can you see them now? - The right hand one. You look very handsome. Higher! More! Do you get them both? Come on. Why do you have two identical Rolex? I've got two balls, why not two Rolex? I like having two of everything. That's it! - In you go, Wolberg. - Throw him in! Know why I like Dali? Because he had balls. Marta, come here. I'm glad to have introduced her to Amestoy. I'm sure she'll be a good actress. I hope so, she's cost me enough. Money's everything to you. You're a parvenu. Better a rich parvenu than a poor one. Until now, we've invested in real estate... but movies could be interesting too. Gonzalez wants to sponsor the girl. I don't like big dogs, they scare me. Small ones... give me the creeps, like rats. I used to have two Yorkshires... two marvels. - Two Yorkies! - Excuse me. They died. I took them everywhere, to the studios... to the theater, everywhere. I carried them in a basket. One was called Josephine and the other, Roberta. He financed two soap operas and made a fortune. Sorry, but I'm not up to business. He's got that American boy, he wants to produce with me. With your girl we can make a film. It may even be distributed in the States. They make a good couple. I can see that. Gil's here, he doesn't look too happy. - Where is he? - Upstairs. Why don't you come in? What's wrong? I told you I'd drown you in shit if you fooled me. But, Gil... And I'll do it. People who live inland have lousier tempers. Do you know why, Gonzalez? Chick-peas. Chick-peas make people lousy tempered. We'll build it, fuck! If Gil backs out, we'll be in big trouble. That bastard's got us by the balls. I pay you a fortune, find a fucking solution. That American moron... is the worst asshole I've ever seen. And I'm putting up with him in my own house. For the love of a woman... I played with fire not knowing... I was the one who'd get burned. I drank from the fountain of pleasure... until I understood... I wasn't the one she loved. For the love of a woman... I gave all I was... life's most beautiful part. But the time I lost... will not always be wasted... when my wound finally heals. It still seems... as if everything were a dream. - Marta, I'm going in too. - No you're not! You're crazy! You're crazy! You're crazy! Claudia, you go home. Can't you see he's drunk? I can't leave him. You ain't going with him, goddamn it! You don't own me. I'm going. Why do you have to ruin everything? We were doing so well. Let her be. Shut up, damn it! You're doing well alright! We'll drop him off and I'll take you home. We'll see about that. Why do you always ruin everything? Let her be! Benito, watch out! - Let her be! - Watch out! Hang on, Claudia! Claudia, speak to me. Claudia, baby, look, look. Here, take my gold Rolex. My head... My head... Very good, that's right. You're not getting candy until you eat your egg. I wish I loved you less. I was willing to do anything. You've ruined my Dad. I always knew you used him... but I turned a blind eye. Look at me. Look at me. Just to have you... to know I shared my life with a man I desired... who turned me on. I love you, Benito. I need you. There's been an inspection. The works are stopped. The building materials were of the worst kind. Gil has pulled out. There's no one to back your husband. Do you know what this means for me? It's his fault. I'm ruined. And so is he. Do you mean that he might go to jail? That's more difficult although not impossible. - I'd lock him up if I could. - Don't say that, Dad. He's a crook. He's taken life's best things from me. My father-in-law has been suspended. The building is going to be razed. My bank accounts will be seized soon. The politicians are using me... to show they're really doing something... against corruption. It's going to be alright. Don't worry. We've put on a night shift. I'm scared. Loneliness is scary, Mosca. It's worse when you're scared of yourself... and you trust nobody. You're my only true friend. The only one. Don't, I don't feel well. I'm tired. It broke, what a pity. I just want to pamper you, look after you. I want to help you. Don't you like me anymore? It's been months since we made love. Make an effort. Wait, you're crushing me. It's alright. Don't worry. There's been accident, come as soon as possible. Mosca was checking on the 26th floor... he fell on the high voltage cables. - I've called the firemen. - What? Everything's in order, he was insured. How dare you, you son of a bitch! - Have you lost your mind? - Bastard! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Mosca! You sure can dance. You sure can dance. I wanted to be a dancer. Relax, it's alright. Always be generous with women and politicians. I can smell money. What a lovely watch. Like it? I've got two. Me too. What do you do? What do I do? I put up buildings, anything that goes up... always upwards. I erect them without permits. The same way that I get hard ons. I was born to triumph, build, erect and get hard-ons. No more surprises, Benito. Where are we going? Benito, what's going on? Who's that? Why do you let him do it? - I brought her for us. - Have you gone mad? Her tits are like Claudia's, only bigger. Why are you untying me? Can't you see he likes it? - What? - Tie me up, hell! Hurry up, I'm cold. Come on, I'm freezing! I can't take it. Get out of my house! Get out right now! I hate you. I hate you with all my soul, Benito Gonzalez. Calm down. How can you compare Claudia to that woman? Do you think we women are all alike? I hate you. You're insane. I'm sick of you. Sick of your manias, of your buildings... of your ambitions, of Dali! I'll make sure my Dad sinks you. You're finished. My Dad and the banks will sink you. Marta! Come back here or you'll be sorry! Let her be. Let her be, poor thing. Kiss me. Untie me. She'll be sorry. How can you live with a woman like her? I've got to get out of this shitty country. Things are getting too complicated. Want to spend a few days in Miami? I'll check things over there. Guess what? I know a lot of people in Miami. What is it? Miami... I'll get it through. Besides... I'll make the most of it. What are you doing? I like your chest. What are you doing? Relax. You're strong. How much do you weigh? How much? Never ask a woman her age or her weight. Why? Why? Ana! Ana! I've got a new project... the "Gonzalez Paradise". - Want to work with me? - You're dreaming. It's her! Hide the ball! Come and help me, dammit! You don't do anything all day long. My little babies. Do you love me? Sure you love me. Yes, you love me, you do. Do you love Mommy? Do you? Do you love her? Your Rolex is in the fridge again! Say it a bit louder so all Miami hears it. I need money. Out of all I invested, there's one apartment left. And it's in my name. That's right, no sugar. No sugar. She's fooling around... with an American. Thanks. Sock it to him! There! Stop it! Move, damn you! Fucking dogs! Where's my Gillette? You gonna shave again? You know I like hair. But they don't over here. They don't like hair and their coffee's shit. Use the bidet instead of shaving. Bringing it over wasn't cheap! What about the bidet? We've got one, don't we? So just fuck off. Poor baby. My own baby. Come! Benito suspects something. I just know it. Don't say that. My love. My little baby. Come! Come, come! I need a man. I knew it. Who is it, tell me? Don't worry about him. Bob's the gardener, he's a friend of mine. - He's the one. - That's impossible! - You asked me, now you know! - You're wrong. Calm down, what's going on? Son of a bitch! Goddamn son of a bitch! How could you? Let me go! Let go! Christ, Beni, I need the money. She pays you? That whore pays you? Let go! Come on, calm down, it's alright. Relax. Let me go. You're screwing Bob... the fucking gardener! What? I forbid you to see him! Don't see that pig! You don't own me. I do as I please. Know something, Ana? I can't stand it. I'm sick of this fucking country... of hamburgers... fried chicken... and their fucking coffee that tastes like shit. Ana... I should be the one who's upset, not you. You can't do this to me. I need you. I can't stay here alone. Please, I beg you. I need a man. I need Bob. Don't leave me. Don't worry. I won't leave you. We can try together. You've always liked threesomes. Only you will fondle my breasts. Come on. Touch me. Come on, touch me. Touch me! Quit crying, damn you! You're making me nervous! It's so good, so good. You like me to talk, don't you? I don't! Shut up or I can't go on. Don't stop, please, don't stop. Come! How much do you pay him? How much? A hundred dollars. 100 lousy dollars. Come on, Bob, it's going to get cold. Coming! My watch's stopped. Where are you going? Fuck bidets, goddamn it! Fuck passion! Fuck... Fuck passion!
