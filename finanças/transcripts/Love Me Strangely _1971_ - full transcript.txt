- What was that? - Call an ambulance! OPERATING THEATER I'm sorry. I did all I could. Mr Alain Revent? Yes? Your wife just died. Who are you? Inspector Leroy, National Police. It happened in public, hence police involvement. Those are the rules. CONCLUSION, IT WAS SUICIDE CONCLUSION, IT WAS SUICIDE? Before concluding this case, some personal details. Born on the...? 27th August 1942. During the war. - In Zurich. - Address. Zurich, 253 Baumstrasse. Profession? No profession. Yes, I'm an annuitant. There are still a few of us left in Switzerland. We didn't have the war. Will you please sign at the bottom of the page? No, thanks. "Baumstrasse, 1942." Why did you do that? Sorry? No, nothing. Those were your wife's last words. Good! Sorry for keeping you. The case is definitively closed. - Goodbye, Mr Revent. - Goodbye. Young lady? You saw her jump? As I see you now, and the husband came to the balcony. And he was making a strange face. A strange face? He was smiling. He was smiling? He was smiling. Which disease did she come to see you about? Insomnia. It's not a disease. It's more of a symptom. An overworked nervous system. I prescribed barbiturates. We found no trace of those in her blood. She may have stopped taking them. Perhaps she no longer needed them? Her stress disappears and she kills herself? Is that logical to you? Little is known about the inner workings of the brain. Between her wedding and suicide, six months. So what? People get married, think they'll be happy, they're not. You see it all the time. Believe me, we have enough hardcore crime on our hands. If we open investigations for all women who aren't happily married and lock up their husbands, there won't be many men left on the street. So, let's be serious. Very good, boss. DEAD END Is it early? No, it's late! I won't be home for eight days. Thank you. Good night! Hello? Who? My scarf? Yes! I must have left it somewhere. Ah, yes, back there! Thanks! How did you know it was my scarf? I recognized your perfume. Forgive me for calling so late. Of course, it could wait. But... I needed to talk to someone. I forgive you. I won't keep you long. I'll come over with your scarf. Oh, no! Not here. Do you know the London Tavern? Tomorrow at six, that's not too late? No, that's great. See you tomorrow. Goodbye. What will madam have? A Martini, please. - Very good, madam. - Thank you! Your eyes are... green? I thought they were blue. That long coat. It looked like a lapdog! I have an old bottle of William Lawson here. I'll open it in your honor! Thank you! We need a phosphorescent coat. Oh, wow! Come on. Listen, you're in a hurry to leave. - You forgot a very important errand. - Me? Tell me, is this the first time you've been here? Call me! Tell me everything! Thank you. Thanks. Is it eleven already? I have a very important errand to run. I must leave. What? You're leaving already? Well, yes. Bye, darling! Thank you! - Goodbye, Alain. - See you soon. He's gone on holiday. Understandable. After what happened to him, he'll want a change of scene. Good evening, madam! - Goodbye! - Goodbye! See you tomorrow. Hello, madam! I've left my dog upstairs, please ask your wife to feed him. - Indeed, okay! - Goodbye! Don't worry, madam! Is Mr Alain Revent here? No, madam, Mr Revent left very early this morning. And you wouldn't know... When he's due back? No, madam. We'll check that later. - Hello. - Hello! The other night, you were so elegant! Thanks to you! You? At ten in the morning? Don't tell me, I've guessed. Arlette? No interruptions, please. Right, madam. There's no middle ground with love. It either tires you or awakens you. With you, it's the latter. So, spill! Vincent called me from Lyon. Just so you know, I'll be in Paris on Monday evening. I'm not sure I'll be here. Jacqueline's invited me out. Understood! - Hello? Florence? - Yes, madam? If Mr Vincent Bersson calls from Lyon, I'm in Chantilly. Tell Chantilly I'm out in the forest with Miss Nathalie Ferreri. Very good, madam! Thanks! Right now, I can't bear seeing him. It's that serious? I think so. You seem so sad, you should be very happy! I'm glad you came. We've never lied to one another, I don't want to start now. We've become... a habit for one another. I didn't even know... that I was bored. You will be most unhappy. Maybe that's what happiness is. Oh, I'm so happy. As per your instructions, I passed through Zurich. I was able to see her. I told her what was going on in your life. She looked at me, fixedly, not saying a word. I think you should pay her a visit, at least every once in a while. Magnificent! He's handsome, he's married you, and even more unbelievably, he respects you. Too much! Before returning to Geneva, we should talk for a few minutes. Not possible, we're leaving. Well, in that case, let me sum up your financial situation... I'm not interested. I was happy to bring you up to speed. - Especially since... - Excuse me. So nice of you to come. I got your invitation. Excuse me. - Congratulations. - Thank you. You're the guilty culprit. Nathalie, my dear. Do you mind? Yes, I met my wife for the first time in your waiting room. You were our matchmaker. That's rare in the police. My friend, Mr Wassermann, a notary in Geneva. Inspector Leroy. Nice to meet you. Keep a close eye on the inspector. Keep him in your sights and do not let him escape. I'm not used to this kind of ceremony. Should I perhaps greet the family? Our friend has only his mother left. Where is she? She has stayed in Zurich. Yes, I understand. If a mother doesn't attend her son's wedding, it's perhaps because she doesn't approve of the marriage? She doesn't disapprove of it either. Why did you want it to be here? I don't know. There must be a reason. Kiss me. Answer me. I don't know. A whim. You're lying! Alain! You want to drive me mad. Me? I don't understand. You pretend not to understand. If I've hurt you, I didn't mean to. Please forgive me. Alain! You've ruined everything! Alain! Since Paris, you... you haven't said a word. Please, don't talk about it. Be happy. I love Venice. I want you to love it, too. My dear, I had asked you to buy him his birthday present. Oh, Alain! How are you? Are you well? Alain, it's been a while since you came. Well? - Could you fetch me a champagne? - No. - Just one! - Well, then! How lovely to see you. I told the hotel to inform me once you'd arrived. My wife. Madam. Nice to meet you. It's an honor to have you here. Welcome to Venice and to my home. - Thank you. - Come, I'll introduce you to my wife. - Excuse me. - Of course. How's things? Come on. You have a stunning palace! Thank you. Francesca, my dear, Mrs Revent. Lovely to meet you! Do you mind? Madame. May I offer you a glass of champagne? - A whiskey, please. - A whiskey. Please don't hate me, I didn't recognize you. I'm hopelessly shortsighted. And the fashions in Paris can change women so dramatically and make them more beautiful every year. Thank you. So, what's new since last year? Remember, some of us friends had tea at your place. My place? At the Danieli. The Lucrezia Suite. I remember it well! Last year, you say? Your honeymoon was last year, wasn't it? You've been here on honeymoon before. It would appear so. It's not very original, Venice. You've probably chosen the same suite, the same room, the same bed. Coming? We're going for a drink. Yes. What do you want? - Champagne? - Yes. - Champagne. - Here you are, sir. Not at all. - Is that your wife? - Yes. Want to meet her? Yes. Come. Pigeon. Aren't you handsome! No. Good morning, my love. Hello, darling. Now, I know. Now, I'm certain that we're going to be happy. Now? Yes, you see... I needed that first night. You don't remember? Alain, I want to go back to Paris... Right away. To think of the face Palmieri will pull when he comes to get us from the hotel tonight. Mr and Mrs Revent? They've gone! Back to Paris. Where do you want us to go? - What would you enjoy? - Dinner with you. - Of course! - Alone with you. With no one around us. A restaurant with no one in is never a good restaurant. No matter. - Where, then? - Here. Great idea. Good. And buy what you want. At your service, ma'am. Good evening, darling. I'm kissing you, but I'm not so sure. Why? You could have told me you were back. I was going to. Liar. So, Venice? Lame. It's a city... how to put it... that's terribly aquatic. Hey, you don't look well. Who told you we were back? Alain. I bumped into Jacqueline while shopping. Yes, he was weigh-laden. He invited me over for a drink. Why? Does this not make you happy? Yes, of course! Darn! I left my car's hood down. It'll turn into a bathtub. Alain? Would you be a dear? Nobody forced him to marry you. So, he must love you. He loves you. There are moments where... I feel like I don't recognize him. You know... You don't understand a man better by making love to him. All done. Thank you, Alain. - Goodbye, darling. - Goodbye. Don't walk me out, I know the way. - Bye, Jacqueline. - Night, Alain. I bumped into her, I couldn't... Yes, I know, of course. But you knew I wanted to be alone with you. I'll go. Sorry! My car won't start. Might Alain know of a mechanic in the area? At this hour, everywhere is closed. I'll take you home. I'm a whore. You wanted to know? Now you know. Will you be back? Never twice. Nice of you to come and wait for me. Give me the key. You want to leave? You want to leave me? But to leave me, you'll need the key. You want the key? Do you? I'll give you the key. Is there a reason she's in this state? No, none. Most nervous breakdowns in women are caused by married life. We should have her admitted to a neurological clinic in Neuilly. A peaceful place where she'll be both monitored... - I'll give her the best care. - As you wish. Beware of anorexia nervosa, which can be a form of suicide. She absolutely must keep eating. Without rushing her, be firm. I'll do all I can. Give me regular updates. Hey. What's new? I'm absolutely shattered. - Go and take a rest, then. - Thanks. Hello, boss. Inspector, there's someone waiting for you. Have a seat. I... I'm sure my visit comes as a surprise. What's going on? I'm scared. Scared of what? When my first wife killed herself, you suspected me, did you not? Why are you asking me that now? I think I attract and that I'm attracted to a certain type of woman. Nathalie slit her wrists. - Is she dead? - No. I saved her. When did this happen? Two weeks ago. Two weeks? - Yes, but the doctor said... - Dr Schwartz? No, a specialist, Mr Richet. Professor Richet? Yes. He said that some who attempt suicide try more than once. So, if by some misfortune that were to happen, I should hate one to think... - "One" being whom? - You. Where's your wife? At home. Who is with her? No one. Quickly go back to her. Mr Revent. Goodbye. - Meunier? - Yes, sir? With all the usual politesse, call in Professor Richet. Today, we need to make a general assessment. Only a blood count will allow us to make the best diagnosis. If you'd like to come this way, madam. No, we'll only be two or three minutes. Here it is, but... this is rather irregular. This is a very exceptional case. This woman is in danger. I have every reason to believe so. A deeper analysis will clarify that. - Thanks, Professor. - Goodbye, Inspector. Normal blood count. But trace presence of dextrorotatory phenylaminopropane tartrate. And what is that in layman's terms? The person is taking a psychoactive drug. Is it a poison? All or almost all drugs are poisons. It depends on the dose. A high dose of this would be particularly dangerous for a neurotic person. We need the mouse to reach a state of depression through fear. Is that possible? Of course. Thanks to conditioned responses. If we scare them every ten seconds it's psychotic fear. I followed your instructions. Watch. This is the control mouse. Non-conditioned, it behaves normally. Logical reflex, rapid, full of health. And how does the conditioned mouse behave? The reflex is worn out by too many alerts. It has become less fast, less violent. Now, I'd like to know whether it's possible to create a drug addiction within the sick one by treating depression. Of course. With a drug that is both calming and euphoric. That exists? Not long ago, you could get them without a prescription. Perfect for creating an ingrained habit. Yes, we call them subscription drugs. Once someone is used to them, they can't live without them. Can we see such an effect? Absolutely, it's very fast. Once drugged, the mouse will experience a state of euphoria. For how long? It varies, but as soon as the drugs wear off, discomfort will take over. The need for the drug becomes acute after how many days? I couldn't say a precise date, but in mice, it's a week. Right, okay. - I'll call you next Monday. - Okay. Goodbye. If you're in no doubt about the drug addiction, stop the experiment. I'll come by tomorrow. Look. It's dead. And yet... You didn't poison it. To the contrary, I weaned it off the drug. But its body needed it to survive. Cruelty causing depression to a pathological state. Then medication leading to drug addiction. You think so? I'm sure of it. Now, and herein lies the crime, he'll suddenly stop the drugs. Do you have proof? The lab is positive. Complete withdrawal could lead to suicide. - This man is a killer. - Oh, come on. His weapon is the deprivation of this drug. This woman needs it to live. You can't be serious. Can you see us in court being asked for evidence and all we can say is withdrawal? Who do you expect to convince? My superior. Me? I don't exist. I am just a relay in the judicial machine that enforces laws. There's a law that allows you to give me the green light. The one obliging us to help those in danger. First, you must prove she's in danger and she must call us. She will. I'll make sure she does. Don't "make sure" of anything. Don't overstep your rights. No provocation or zeal. Is it zealous to want to prevent a crime? We don't prevent crimes, we catch criminals. That's the law. - The law is stupid. - Possibly. Do you realize how stupid that sounds? Do you realize who you're talking to? By your reasoning, we should wait for this woman to be killed before we help her. That's appalling. That's how it is. If you don't like it, resign. No! I'll wait till I'm fired! And I promise you I won't go quietly! I'll wake up people's consciences. I forbid you from pursuing this investigation based on accusations. I'll pursue it till the very end. If things get tricky, I won't support you. I'll do without you. That's dangerous. So be it. Stubborn, aren't you? But, I think, were this woman not so pretty, you mightn't be so determined to protect her. - I hope you're joking. - Of course I am. If Mrs Revent presses charges, you and I will be covered. Inform me as soon as you're successful. I'd rather inform you now. I'll do what I think I have to do, even if I'm mistaken, even if it means losing my job. I do not care. May I? I'm not disturbing you? Not at all. Come in. My husband just went out. Maybe you passed him? No, I wasn't so lucky. Have a seat. What would you like to drink? Bourbon, right? How do you know that I like bourbon? We drank some together on my wedding day. Ah, that's true. What a memory. That day your husband told me I was the reason that the two of you met. Hence why I've come to check on you. Thank you. Your husband was concerned. And it was me he confided in. In a friendly way. I didn't know. You were... depressed? Some more? Nervous breakdowns are more a matter for one's loved ones. Friends... Isn't that so? My husband has... taken great care of me. I'm sure he has. Some drugs are very effective, I believe. Perhaps. But... as you say, it's not the drugs that heal you. But the way they're given. And now you're fine? Indeed. If I don't look well, it's because I haven't done my make-up or hair. I'm ugly as sin. Many women would love to be your kind of ugly. I was very touched when your husband voiced his concerns to me. It was a sign of trust. I hope you, too, have a liking for me. Even if it's not completely true, I'd like to believe it. Let me help you. No, thanks. I don't need anyone to help me. I'm very happy. My husband and I, we... we're very united. Yes, very united. Very happy. Well, so much the better. I hope that lasts a lifetime. Alain. Shh. He got here last night. For how long? As long as he likes. He's at home here. Alain, I'll do anything for a coffee. In exchange for a coffee. Madam, is this Alain Revent's home? Yes. - Might you be Mrs Revent? - Yes. We are the extras for tonight's reception, madam. For tonight's... reception? Ah, yes! Yes, of course. Come in. Come in. It's through there. LENÔTRE CATERING - Mrs Revent? - Yes. Hello. Lenôtre Catering. Here are the goods you ordered. Come in. - Here, carry that, please. - Okay. Good evening, sir. Good evening, darling. We're entertaining? Of course. It's Dino's birthday. We've invited friends, charming people. But they're of no interest to you. You're very pale. You should go to bed. You need rest. Happy birthday. Care to dance? That's enough. You think you've made him jealous? I know what he likes. It might seem weird. But I'm sure it'd make him very happy if you and I... He likes making people suffer. But he likes to suffer, too. That's why he's left us alone. Since you love him... and I love him too... let's make him happy. You disgust me. Get the hell out. Has-been. No. No. No. Where is Dino? Gone. You mean he's gone out? No. I chucked him out. You did? Yes. And with pleasure. I want a divorce. A divorce? Alright. Alright. LAWYER OF THE PARIS BAR What's the matter? What are you looking for? Nothing. Then go to sleep. You'll need all your strength for the law courts. Where is... my medication? What medication? The stuff you gave me. The blue bottle. I don't know what you mean. My husband accepts the divorce. - Are you in agreement? - I never said that. Then am I lying? - Madam, please calm down. - Mr President. If I had, as she claims, agreed to the divorce, I wouldn't be here attempting to reconcile. Yes, that does sound fair. I love my wife dearly. He loves humiliating me. For example? He cheated on me. He wanted me to cheat on him. That doesn't make sense. You don't understand. What's more, he's never really been my husband. This is one of her obsessions. She's always saying she'll divorce me by invoking the non-consummation of marriage. Is that what you're invoking? - Yes. - With what proof? As for me, I can prove the marriage was consummated. My wife is with child. With child? But that's not true. It's not true. A medical exam will clarify that. But it's not true! He's lying. He's talking nonsense. He wants people to think I'm crazy. He's talking nonsense. DOCTOR'S SURGERY You are eight weeks' pregnant. Are you sure, doctor? No doubt about it, madam. Hello? I'd like to speak to Inspector Leroy. He's in a meeting and can't be disturbed. But it's urgent! I've already called three times! I'm telling you, I can't disturb him. As soon as he's finished, have him call me. Who's asking? Alain Revent. Alma 11-55. Very well, sir. Thank you. Hello? - Inspector Leroy here. - Good evening, Inspector! - Why are you calling? - My wife's gone missing. I'm very worried. You must find her. I'll alert all local police stations. Yes... Understood... - Please. - I'll call you. Thank you. He's looking for you. I'll keep nothing from you. Your husband was born in Zurich. I know. His mother fled Germany in 1942. After being abused. His mother fled Germany in 1942. After being abused. She sought refuge in Switzerland, where she had some possessions. She had to be committed to a psychiatric hospital. She had to be committed to a psychiatric hospital. And she's still there. That's where your husband was born. And she's still there. That's where your husband was born. Your husband is a dangerous man. It is imperative that you seek police protection. Your life is in danger. Your husband is a dangerous man. It is imperative that you seek police protection. Your life is in danger. My husband needs me. Hello? Hello. At last, it's you. Where are you? What does it matter? I must see you. You haven't hurt me enough. If I've hurt you, you must forgive me. There's something within me that makes me... I tried to resist, but... Nathalie! Yes? Nathalie, I know you love me. You must help me. Listen. I'm coming to get you. Give me the address. The hotel... I'm coming now. Wait for me. Mrs Revent. Mrs Revent? She paid her bill and left the hotel. She didn't leave a message? No. Who are you? Hello? Mr Alain Revent? Inspector Leroy. Good evening, Inspector. Come to Police HQ right away. What's going on? You knew she was pregnant! No. Yet that is what you proclaimed. I didn't want to lose her. Oh, you're... You hate me. Justice can do nothing against you. But as for me... I will prevent you from destroying your wife. Hello? I'm coming. Don't push. We waited for you. We touched nothing. Subtitle translation by: Lucy Harford
