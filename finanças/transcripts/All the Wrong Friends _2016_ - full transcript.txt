Tell me it's gonna be okay. Tell me everything is gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. Everything's gonna be okay. Let's go over our game plan. We gotta make sure he doesn't sneak off to the bathroom or anywhere else until we're sure he has absolutely no drugs, okay, Simon? We've been through this, man. I don't understand why it always has to be me taking care of Adam. I mean, you see him all the time. He can take care of himself. Yeah, obviously not. My mom said he got kicked outta school. Isn't she well informed? Yeah, well, at least now we have our opening. Oh, no way! Adam! It's been a long time, buddy. Who's fault is that? Man, you should a stayed here and gone to Tri-C with me and Simon. Yeah? Yeah, you're missing out. Well, you can tell me all about it on our way to Terra stock. And I'm so pumped. Great music, beautiful women. Absolutely. But we should a hit the road earlier. Nani said it's gonna be like 10-hour drive. Nani's coming? I told you that. Thought you were joking. Hey, Adam. Come on, man. Give me your bag. Yeah, we're not stopping for Indian food. You know, she's not gonna be too happy about this. Happy about what? I sort of invited Logan and Erika. What? Well, they've never been to Terra stock and they didn't have plans, so I figured what the hell. Adam, come on, man. Uninvite them. Little too late now. Uh, Terra stock, anybody? Hi, Logan. What's up, y'all? Who's ready to get their freak on with the arts? What are we driving here? Well, I didn't know you were coming. You could a emailed me. Who's this? Oh, Nani, this is Logan. Logan, Nani. Hi. Hi. Listen, you wouldn't happen to have a Pomeranian named Ali Baba, would you? I was just checking. I think I ran it over on the way here. I'm just kidding. I'll be right back. Erika, get outta your coma. So apparently, Logan and Erika are coming with us. Yeah, I can see that. There goes your plan. Got the drugs! He's joking, okay? No, I'm not. No, listen, okay, this is just a little speed bump, okay? We'll make sure Logan and Erika get their own room... Terra stock! We can still talk to Adam alone, okay? You know the only reason - I came on this trip... - Terra stock! Was so... Yeah, I know, I know, I know, I know. You're here to help me, okay, but... Terra stock! Quiet! Everything's gonna be fine, all right? Terra stock! Quiet. Terra stock. We're gonna have fun, okay? Hey, Nani! I call window. Come on. Do ya trust me? Could you give me my purse? It's just right there. Drew. All in back, yo. Let's go. We're not all gonna.

Where are we? We weren't supposed to get off the interstate until Simon's shift. It's fine. Go straight past this bridge. Hello? Give me the map. Hey, is this some kind of shortcut? I'm gonna go see a friend of mine. I have some stuff to pick up. Here? Right here on the left, Adam. Wow, your friend really likes his privacy. Right? And there's a lake right out back. Stay here. Such a dick. Simon. What's he picking up again? How should I know? Hey, Mondo! Where are we? Looks like the middle of nowhere. Who's this friend he's picking stuff up from? Mondo. Mongo? Mondo! Mondo. Mondo. It's short for Armando, but he's white. You're fine. Hey, Simon. Check out these trucks. I know. Crazy, right? That Jeep was working two months ago. Oh, yeah? You been here before? Few times. Well? He's not here. Great. Let's get back out on the road. I need my stuff. Logan, we can get your stuff on the way back. No, we need to get it right now for this trip. Let's just wait here a little while. - Logan... - Drew... If we wait any more, Terrastock's gonna start without us. Well, great, then we'll just stay here tonight. Adam, go get the bags. Wait, I thought you said your friend wasn't even here. Point taken. Um, everybody raise your hand if you're happy Nani's here. Mondo happens to be a friend of mine, and friends let other friends borrow their houses. Logan, this is pretty weird, okay? Listen, we're gonna leave right now, and we'll make it to the hotel by what, one? Two in the morning, right? Drew, shut up. We're staying here for the night. We can leave first thing in the morning, and we'll have all day tomorrow at the festival. Okay, Nani? Let's go. You better have booze. Lots of booze! No you remember, okay, remember that time you got so stoned, and Simon went and creeped out by your window and pretended to be Chupacabra... It's not fucking funny, man. You know I'm standing... I will suck you dry. And he hides in the closet for like two hours, and he's like Chupacabras were Spanish. Why is he speaking English? Chupacabras, man. Attention, ladies and gentlemen. I have some excellent news. Here he is. Well, Drew, come on, you're up first. Man, we did some crazy shit back then, huh? Yeah, no shit, man. Drew, quit stalling. You're up first to bat, come on. He doesn't want to. I wasn't asking you. But you are welcome to join us as wlell. I'm fine with beer. Mondo, Mondo, Mondo. Ew. Oh my God. Bite me, princess. Oh, no don't leave. Please. Logan. Come back. Simon, weren't you gonna ask Logan something? Ask me what? What? Are you sure Mondo's okay with this? Yes. I already told you guys, I'm good for the money. He knows that. Let's have some fun. It's on me. Adam. I mean, for fuck's sake, are you gonna take it or not? Yeah, yeah. I mean, normally, I only snort with 20s, but I guess. Oh, you're so fancy. Eh, do another? Mondo, man. Come on, man, is this a PSA? Fuck you. Mondo. Feel like a better person? Well? Andrew! Don't you have anything to say to me? Oh, wow, okay, now I get it. Now I realize why you didn't want me to tag along on your trip in the first place. You just thought this was gonna be some big fun drug binge weekend, didn't you? What? Nani, no, that's not what this is. And that trip down memory lane with you, Adam, and Simon? Wow, that was enlightening about how you guys were stoned all the time. Yeah, but you had to have been there. Chupacabra was like the pinnacle... Oh my God, stop! Be honest with me, is this what you want? Because five minutes with them, and I feel like you don't even know that I exist. Nani, you need to calm down, all right? Remember who you're talking to. I'm here to help Adam. Oh, ah, yeah, Adam, I forgot. How's that working out for you, Drew? Mondo! Mondo! He'll be here, no, seriously. I was lucky. I had you in my life to help me through all the rough things, but Adam, he doesn't have anyone like that, okay? Except for maybe me. You shouldn't'a let Logan come along. He's just making everything worse. Yeah, well, Logan is a dick, okay? And once we get to Terra stock, I'm sure Erika and him will vanish into thin air like vampire bats. And we'll be back with Simon helping out Adam, okay? Just forget about those two. Okay. Hey. You think Mondo would mind if we, uh, borrow his bed for a couple minutes? Wow, really, a couple minutes? That's all you got? Mondo really is my hero. I could spend the rest of my life out here. Adam, get me another beer. What kind? Surprise me. Well, I mean, we got more lite beer, but there's that German stuff in there, that ale, it's, it's really good. Adam, just get me a fucking beer. I love him. What if this guy doesn't come back? Mondo? The guy's a fucking hermit. He never walks farther than it takes to get to the beach. He'll be here. I'm not going to Terra stock and hanging out with some punk rock teeny boppers unless I'm on something. How much are you getting? Enough. Enough for what? Enough for two months' rent. You're selling it? Fuck yeah, I'm selling it, man. Selling DMT at Terra stock is like selling candy at an orphanage. Everybody wants it. Try selling DMT at an orphanage. Yeah. What is this? What the fuck? What is it? No! Fuck! It's okay. What are you guys doing in here? In there. What the fuck? It's Mondo. What? It's Mondo. It's Mondo. Oh, Fuck, Man. Somebody killed Mondo. Somebody killed Mondo. Mondo is dead in the bathroom. Yeah, Logan, we fuckin' heard you, all right? Well, how did this happen? Like we fuckin' know. Ya found him! Yeah, we found him. Like that. Okay, okay, okay, okay, let's just everybody think about this, just take a second, collect yourselves. Everybody shut the fuck up and let's just think about it , ya know? I'll go call the police. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Well, excuse me. - Let them go! - Okay, yes, we are going to call the police, but first let's get this place cleaned up, okay? What the fuck are you talking about, Logan? Erika, Simon, you go downstairs, you get all the luggage and put it back in my car, go. Adam, go get some trash bags. Adam! Go get some fucking trash bags! Logan, I don't know what fucking game you're trying to play here, but we need to call the cops right now before we destroy this crime scene. We're not the fucking Hardy boys, okay, Drew? And I'm not gonna go to jail because you feel like playing fucking detective! Logan. Fuck! Logan! God damn it, come on, Nani. Do you have any idea what this is going to look like? I know exactly what this is gonna look like, which is why we have to clean up. No, we have to call the cops right now. I heard you, and I said not yet. Logan, this is not your decision to make. And yet somehow, I made it! What the hell, Logan? What are you doing? I'll tell ya what I'm doing. I'm dealing with your asshole friend that just broke the phone! Would you grow the fuck up? What exactly were you going to tell the cops, anyway? Yeah, we just broke into a house, got high as a kite, and then happened to find a dead body! Good luck in prison. I'll pay you a conjugal visit. Now, if you wanna keep us out of jail, you will help us clean up. Move! Andrew. You are not seriously going along with this? I'm gonna go get dressed. Women. Am I right? Are you stealing from a dead guy? What, you think the world's full of trust fund babies? Yeah, you never had to worry about that, did you? People like you don't have to worry about scrounging through people's pockets for valuables. You know, I never had that luxury. Hey! Oh, this is great. The two of you can clean up this room. You know, if one of you's gonna be naked, I much prefer it to be her. You're not even gonna say anything. Listen, let's just finish up as quick as we can and get outta here. Ah, doesn't it even bother you that he was threatening me? Geez, Nani, what was I supposed to say, huh? We got a lot bigger problems to worry about other than the fact that Logan is an asshole. Things'll go a lot smoother if we just work together. Look, let's just leave. That's what we're trying to do. No, I mean now. Fine. But you can do this without me. Don't strain yourself too much helping out. I think I can get the stuff out of Mondo's safe. It's probably locked. Yes, thus fulfilling its purpose as a safe. I stole Mondo's keys. One of 'em is bound to work. And we can just take the stuff? It's not like Mondo's gonna miss it. Might as well go to a good cause. Like me. Okay. So what's our plan? Our plan is, as soon as they come downstairs, you keep them here. I'll go upstairs, grab the stuff, put it in our bags. Hey, upstairs is all clean. Okay, are Aladdin and Princess Jasmine done yet? I think so. Why don't you guys head into the next room... What the fuck is that? Should we, should we hide? I'm pretty sure they saw us. Stay here, clean the rest of this shit up right now. Hi, can I help you guys? We were hiking in the woods, and my sister hurt her leg. Whoa, that does not look good. I tripped. She fell, and, and hurt her leg on some rocks. Look, we've been walking around for hours, and this is the first house we've found. Of course, um, Erika, don't just stand there. Why don't you grab some towels or something, huh? Thank you very much. No problem. It wouldn't be very American of us to turn you guys away. I mean, what does the Bible say? Give unto others. So, can we come in, or? Oh! Yes, right. The kitchen is right there if you guys just wanna have a seat. We'll take a look at that leg, okay? Thank you. No problem. So, what'd you say your names were? I'm Brian. Alison. Logan. I'm sorry. Ah, this does not look good. Wonder what happened to Erika. Is there someplace I can go to wash my leg off? Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, of course. Um, the bathroom is straight through here. Let me check with Erika and see if she's found any bandages for you. You should be able to find everything you need straight through there. It's a nice place you got here. I wish. It's a friend of mine's. We're actually watching it right now. Let me know if I can get you anything. What the hell are you doing? I am trying to play this smart. You saw that leg. It's gonna look a little suspicious if we kick her out on her ass. It's gonna look a lot more suspicious when they find a dead body upstairs. Exactly! We are so fucked! Sh! If we can heal her and get them out of here, everything is going to be fine, okay? They've already seen us. How's it gonna look when they hear about a murder in here? Would you try and keep a positive mind? Now, did you find anything we can use to bandage up her leg with? No, I came in here to find out what you wanted to do. Un-fucking-believable. What are you doing now? Nothing, Nani, just stay upstairs. Drew. What the hell's going on? Here, come on. Logan, Logan! What the hell is happening? Will you stop with the touching? You let two random people inside? What? What? I have it under control. Who are these people? They're hikers. So they claim. One of them is injured, and needs our help. We're fucked. You already said that. Don't you realize, once we help them, then we can get rid of them. Whoa, get rid of them? Not like that. Get them to their car or whatever. You know, we really do not need them to find you tweaking out. Why don't you go upstairs? You serious? Yes, there's a dead body in the house. We don't want them poking around - and... - Come on, Adam, just go upstairs, all right? Sh! Go. All right. This is stupid, Logan. Hey, good news. Looks like we found some stuff to bandage up your leg. Oh. Everybody this is Alison and Brian. Hello! Hello! - Hi, you guys. - Hi. Welcome. Why don't you have a seat on the couch? Her leg looks pretty bad. I can imagine. Why don't you put your leg right here? All right, ready? - Here you go. - Easy, easy, easy. Good night! Yeah. You guys were hiking? Yeah, actually. Did you run into a critter or something? Uh, she fell and, uh, hit her legs on some rocks. That's jacked. Think you guys can make it back to your car? Oh, we've been hiking for miles. It would take hours to get back. She probably wouldn't make it. Well, you can't stay here. Logan? I mean, think about it, these bandages are gonna hold up for now, but you guys really need to see a doctor. Maybe we can drive you to your car or the nearest hospital. I'll bring the car around. Great. Simon, why don't you come with me? Sure. Thank you very much. No problem. I mean, I would suggest we call an ambulance, but we don't really have a phone right now. Yeah, our friend's kinda stupid. Bit of a scatterbrain. He forgets to pay the phone bills sometimes. Yeah, we could totally use a phone. Well, why don't we get you guys to the car port? All right. It's gonna be straight out the back door. Here we go, kiddo. Got it? I'm right behind here Thanks. Of course. Hey! What's up? Thought you guys were bringing the car around. Yeah, the car won't start. What do you mean, the car won't start? Let me see. Be my guest. Do me a favor? Pop the hood. Hey, hey, Logan, what are you doing to my truck? Your truck won't start. What? I said your Classic here will not start. Erika, can I get in here, please? Sorry about that, guys. You think you can fix it? I used to watch those NASCAR pit teams on TV. It's beautiful. It's like a redneck. Yeah, well, I watch a lotta football, but that doesn't mean I'm Troy Aikman. It was working before. You know anything about cars? I know that asking a bunch of stupid questions is not gonna get the car fixed, all right, bud? Hey, guys? Did it make a sound? I actually, uh, used to work at the dealership if you don't mind me taking a look? Oh, great, man, no problem. You probably know what I'm doing a lot more than you do. You, yeah. I got it. Hey, what are you thinking bringing a lemon on a road trip? Listen, it was working fine before we got here, okay? Before we came to visit your stupid friend. Oh, yeah, it was probably Mondo's ghost. Is that what you were thinking? You know, guys, I really don't know. I mean, it could be anything. I just can't see. It's so frickin' dark out here. Oh, we should get a flashlight. Okay, listen, listen, one of us can go walk to the nearest house and ask for help. You wanna get murdered? That's not funny, Logan. Hey, why don't we let Alison and her brother stay here tonight, and then we'll worry about the car in the morning? No, I have not checked that with Mondo... - Yeah, and... - We need to make... And if he can't fix the car, then we'll just walk down the road and get some help. Look, your leg is badly injured, and I don't feel comfortable leaving you here tonight without seeing a doctor, okay? Well, if you can get her to a doctor, then go right ahead. I don't think we have a choice. Sleep well. Hope that feels better. Thank you. Man, are you really gonna let them spend the night? What was that? You were the one who let 'em in in the first place. You're a fuckin' idiot. Hey, man... Do not get me started on you either. Okay, I still don't understand why we just didn't take them to the hospital. My truck wouldn't start. The truck wouldn't start! Now does anyone else find that a little suspicious? That two hikers come bounding out of the woods, we are nice enough to give them some help, and miraculously, the car won't start? Yeah, I'm sure that after they cut open her leg, they stopped to disable our car so we couldn't take them to the hospital. That makes perfect sense. If I was a serial killer, I'd think it was a great idea. We are so fucked. We didn't have another option. We had plenty of options until somebody broke the phone. It's not like calling the cops was gonna do anything. Yeah, but we could've called the ambulance. Yeah. They would a gotten them out here forever ago. Okay. This is what we're going to do. We will stay up, and we will make sure they don't do anything. So wait, we're gonna stay up all night and just watch them? We're gonna do it in shifts, you idiot. Me and Erika will take the first watch, okay? I'm not tired. I'll stay up, too. Yeah, I will, too. I think you should get some sleep, Adam. Yeah, Adam, come on, get some rest. Here, you can do second shift with me. Yeah, I'm gonna sleep real easy knowing these three are keeping watch. No way, I am staying awake. I'm not staying up if she's staying up. Well, she's not staying up. I'm not staying up if Simon's not staying up. Simon... Wait, why doesn't Drew stay up? Well, Drew can't stay up - if I'm not staying up... - Adam, I can't stay up. He's staying up. I'm not staying up. Oh my fucking God. Me, Erika, and Simon will stay up. Drew, you put a muzzle on her, or I swear to God I will find some duct tape. Calm down. Calm down? Am I the only one who remembers there's still a dead body up there and two complete strangers across the hall. Nani, stop. Okay, we're all really tired and stressed out, and there are two people who we don't even know staying here, okay? Take two of those. Hey... They're just sleeping pills, Adam. What you think, I'm gonna give her my Scooby snacks? No, thank you. It's gonna be a long night. Whatever. Take 'em if you want. But we need to get some rest either way. Now why don't you guys go get some sleep? We'll wake you up in a few hours. Go on. Does Drew have a problem with me? How should I know? You're his friend. Drew hates me. Do not roll your eyes at me. You think that's what I need right now? Hey, where're you going? I'm gonna go take a piss. May I take a piss, Logan? Sure. Thank you. What? Come here. No. Why not? Stop it, Logan. I'm not fucking around with you, stop it. I said get off! - Get the fuck off me. - What the fuck is your problem? I'm not fucking around right now! Erika. They're less annoying when they're asleep, huh? I'm so sick of this bullshit. It's been a rough night. Not just tonight. I can do better than him, can't I? Erika. Nice, Mondo. Adam. Adam! What? You don't hear that? Hear what? Help me! It's Erika. Help! Oh my God! Logan! Oh my God! What happened? We don't know. Somebody attacked him, man. Well, what do we do? What are we supposed to do, man? Help me! What are you doing? He's dying. What do you mean, someone attacked him? What the fuck happened to him, Simon? I don't know, man! Logan. Oh my God, he's... I just found him here. I don't think he did this to himself, do you? Oh my God, he's fucking dying. He's not moving. Oh, he is fucking dead, man. Oh, we are so fucked. Adam, look at me. What are we supposed to do... Look at me, Adam, look at me! Is there a phone in that house? What? What? Is there another phone in that house? You've been here before, just think... Yeah. Yeah? Uh... No? No! Think. No, no! Just, just the one that Logan snapped. He's right, man. Where are the hikers? Adam! Let him go, man! What? Weren't you just in there? Yeah, but... Did you see them inside? No, but they could've slipped... If those people are responsible for this, they're long gone. Okay... We can't leave him like this, okay? Come on. Get his legs. Come on, Simon! Fuck. Don't, fuck me. Ah, it's getting all over me. Jesus Christ, his head's on me, man. Oh fuck, Simon. Oh, God. Jesus! Well, shouldn't we cover him up? What? You know, cover his face. Use your shirt. What the fuck are you talking about? You're the one who wants to cover him up, man. Oh, God. What the hell was that? It's the hikers. Adam's with 'em. They're still here? Oh my God, Adam has a gun. Adam should not have a gun! Okay, what... I found these sick fucks rummaging through Mondo's closet. Listen, Adam, where's Nani? Turn the fuck around. Look! Look, that is my friend. Look what you did to him! I don't know what you're fucking talking about! Adam, where did you get that gun? The voodoo man. Oh, that sounds good. What? Will someone please get this crazy motherfucker away from us? Everybody shut up! Okay, Adam, relax. We're gonna let the police handle this. We're gonna call the police. What police, Drew? There are no fucking cops! Okay, listen, we're gonna get some, okay? We don't have a phone! Listen, 'member the, the convenience store? There's a convenience store two miles up the road. I'm gonna walk there right now, okay? It's closed by now, man. Okay, listen, Adam. I'm gonna stay here. I'm gonna stay here all fuckin' night, all right? They're not gonna go anywhere, all right? Please don't let him kill us. You killed Logan! We don't know that! And they fucking killed Mondo, and they're just waiting around to kill us, too, Drew. Drew, look! That is Logan! That is our friend! God damn it, Adam! Fuckin' touch me, man. Fuckin' touch me. I'm your friend. I don't want you to do something that you're gonna regret for the rest of your life, okay? Just put down the gun. Please. We need to get outta here, Drew. I know. We're gonna get outta here. Just... Put down the gun. Nani. Shit! Was that Logan? Is he dead? What happened? We don't know. Is that why Adam was pointing a gun at those people, because he doesn't know? We think it was the hikers. Adam was pointing a gun at them, Drew. Yeah, I know, he lost his head, but it has to be them. We're gonna figure it out, okay? Oh my God, you keep saying that. Everything is just gonna get worse. No, no, no, it's not gonna get worse, okay? I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. Let's just go, okay? Let's just, let's just get up and start walking, okay? And someone'll find us. It's gonna be okay. No, you are not listening to me. We don't have to be here, Drew. Let's just leave, okay? Or, or, or let's just stay here until morning, okay? I just don't wanna go back. I can't leave Adam behind. He was pointing a gun at you, Drew. Please. I know. He's just scared. He's just scared, Nani. Tell me everything is gonna be okay. What the fuck? What the fuck, Adam? What happened? Everything was fine. What the fuck, Simon? I left you in charge! What do you want from me, man? He had a gun. He wanted to tie 'em up, so we did the girl, and then this guy started arguing, so he fuckin' shot him. Why, why, why did you tie them up? Ask Adam. Okay, why were you doing anything that Adam had to say? Because Adam was high as shit with a gun in his hand. Look who's talking. Fuck you. Can I just point out that there is a girl tied up in our shed right now, and this guy is gonna bleed to death unless we do something right now. So let him die. He killed Logan. I didn't kill him. Bullshit! You killed my boyfriend, now we're gonna let you die, you sick son of a bitch. Erika, stop. Fuck you! You don't care? Fine. Guess you don't care about your sister either. She didn't do anything to you. Just let her go. Why, so she can go to the cops and pin this whole thing on us? Enough, okay? We need a plan. Let's go through our options. Options? Yeah, how the phone is broken, how the car won't start, how there's a dead body upstairs. Hey, thanks, Simon, a lotta good options. Adam? Do you have anything to contribute? Do you want this on your conscience? He's gonna die! There's nothing I can do about that. He's right. Look at him. I can fix it. The car. So you couldn't do anything about it when you were fine, but now that you've been shot, you can fix the car? Obviously I can't move on my own, but with some help, I can give another look. Isn't that just convenient? Okay, listen, a bad plan's better than no plan at all. Uh, check the, uh, spark plugs. Okay. Uh, where are those? They should be the sixth, no, it's on the top of the engine block. Which one's the engine block? It's the giant metal block that looks like a middle finger. Make sure there's no dirty connection. It needs to be cleaned. Okay, how do I do that? I guess we should a paid attention in auto shop, huh? Brought you some water. Where's Brian? He's in the house. I wanna see him. I can't. I can't. Why? We killed Mondo! The guy who was here, the guy you found in the bathroom? Brian killed him, but he didn't mean to. Why are you telling me this? Because you need to know. 'Cause I don't wanna know. I wanna get home. Stop! I'm telling you this because we didn't kill your friend. You're lying. Why would I lie about this now? Because you're tied up, because you wanna get outta here. I know, but, but just hear me out before you decide whether to believe me or not. You owe me that for what your friend did to Brian. He is not my... Fine. I'm listening. Me and Brian, we broke in here to rob Mondo. We bought drugs from him before, been here to pick it up, and knew he kept it all in a safe in his room. We thought we'd just get it outta there, take it back, and have plenty of time to bust it open, but... We were still trying to get it loose from the closet when Mondo came back and saw us. He pulled a knife, and Brian just fought. It was self-defense, you know? But before we could even think about what to do, we heard your car pull up, so we got outta there. Well, then, why didn't you just wait until we left? Why did you come in? Well, that was the plan. We didn't know you guys were gonna decide to fuckin' move in. Look, you saw what Mondo did to my leg, right? We thought that... You could get us to a hospital, or at least call an ambulance, or something? You wanted us to take you to a hospital? Well, why did you disable the car? We didn't touch your car. Did you hear anything I just said? I needed a doctor. I still do. Do you think that if we knew what was wrong with your car that we wouldn't tell you when Brian's been shot? What happened to Logan? I don't know, and that's the truth. But you weren't in your room when they found him. We though that you were all asleep, so we went back to finish the job with the safe. We didn't know you were gonna start killing each other. Look, you wanna believe me or not, fine, but we didn't kill that guy right there, which means one o' your friends did! Least I know where I stand. Shit! I can't fix it, man. Fuck! Drew, I need to talk to you. Can it wait? It's important. Okay. You wanna give this thing a shot, Simon? Okay, I talked to Alison. Okay. And she told me that she and Brian killed Mondo. No surprise there. She also told me they didn't kill Logan. Well, who did, then? I don't know. Nani, listen, you gotta understand, she's going to say whatever she thinks you wanna hear, okay? Okay, well, I'm gonna talk to Brian at least, so I can see if their stories match up. Okay, I'll keep working on the truck. Simon! Is he dead? Simon! Simon! Brian's dead. Adam needed you, and you weren't there. And this happened. Me? What about you? What about me? What do you want me to say, man? Where are you going? Upstairs. Where's Adam? Drew, I. Adam? Oh, shit! Ah, shit. How many did you take? One or two. Bullshit. How many, Adam? Four or five. Four and five, nine, Adam? How many? Three beers. Four beers. Fuck my ass, Adam, come on. No thanks, Drew. Gonna take four or five more for that. What? Can I talk to you? Why the fuck are you whispering? Sh. Can we go outside? Why? I feel like they can hear us in here. Just come outside with me. It's important. There's something wrong with Simon. What are you talking about? He's acting funny. As opposed to what? You? I think Simon killed Logan. What makes you think that? Well, I talked to Alison, and she said that they killed Mondo, but they had nothing to do with Logan. Wait, the tied-up junkie said that she didn't kill my boyfriend? I'm shocked, Nani. Yeah, she did. And I believe her. Simon let Brian die. What do you mean? When we were walking back, he was standing over him, and oh my God, that look he gave me, I am never gonna be able to get it out of my head, okay? There's just something not right about him. And who else could've killed, Logan, huh? It wasn't me or Drew, it wasn't you, and I don't think that Adam could've done it without completely wigging out. We are so fucked. Hey, if I die, I die drunk. He died as he lived. He was a man of simple tastes. He liked "Boys to Men," Super Soakers, and "Home improvement." Oh, you smell like blueberries. Why are you telling me this? Because Drew won't listen to me anymore, and Adam is Adam. What do we do? Okay, we need to convince Drew and Adam, and then we need to get a hold of the cops, and if we can't do that, then we need to confront Simon. Come on, one. One, two, three. Yeah, go, number, - three, four... - You ever just like wanna ride on a moose? Actually pretty often, yeah, I do. Hey, coke head, what's going on here? Lasagna. An and a. Nani. Amacondas! Nani. Okay, okay, I can do it. I can do it. What the hell happened to him? It's fine, just relax, okay? Oh, seriously? Relax? Adam isn't exactly feeling his best right now. Dude, I didn't feel any of that. You know, they're very territorial animals. So what's our plan to get outta here? Simon! Well, it's way too dark to go outside now, and besides, the road's way too far. Those are problems, not solutions, Drew. Well, I'm sorry, man. You wanna come down here, maybe fix that phone in the kitchen? Yeah that, that would help out a lot. Come on, give it a shot, Simon. Why don't we take the boat? Yeah? Are we going fishing? Hey, wait. Is there a radio? Uh... No, on the boat. Is there a radio on the boat? Simon, Simon! Do you even know how to work a boat radio? Do you? Drew. Simon, wait! What's wrong? Simon! Where the fuck is Alison? Where's Brian? Where's my Brother? What's on your mind? It was Simon. Simon killed Logan. What? Where is he? What'd you do to him? He's fine. Just calm down... Shut up and tell me where he is! Drew took him to the hospital. You're lying. No, no, I'm telling the truth. He's gonna be fine. When we came back, and Brian was dead, that look in Simon's eyes, - I could just... - Wait, that look? Nani, I've known Simon my entire life, okay? And he is not capable of anything like that, trust me. They fixed the car, and they took him. He's gonna be fine. I swear. I didn't hear a car. They took him. Just tell her the truth already! Shut up. Stop it. She doesn't deserve to be lied to like this. What's she talking about? Nothing, nothing, just... Brian's dead, Alison. Shut up. What? He died hours ago failing to fix the car. He didn't even make it to the hospital. That's not true. Tell me he's not dead. Stone cold. So you can just quit with the little bullshit act. Shut up. Just shut the fuck up! Ask Simon. He was there. What? What do you think's taking 'em so long? I don't know. Stop. Yeah. He watched Brian die. He let him die. Please. Oh what, now do you feel bad? It's a little late for that. You didn't feel bad when Brian was begging for his life! You knew he was dying, and you let him die. You just stood there. He just stood there. And watched as your brother bled to death, gasping for air. I'm gonna go check on 'em. Take care o' Adam. Do you wanna know what his dying wish was? No matter what happened to him, he just wanted to make sure that his sister would be okay. You were there. Weren't you? Is it true? Did he ask about me? And, and now he's dead? Yes. It's her fault. She told me to do it. If you're gonna go down that road, why don't you just tell her the whole thing? What do you mean? You know exactly what I'm talking about. How you were the one who killed Logan and got them blamed for it in the first place! If he hadn't gotten your fucking brother tied up, he wouldn't be dead now. Stop! Are you guys all right? Simon, are you okay? I've been better. Erika? Oh shit, you're bleeding like crazy. Are you okay? I'll manage. Did you guys try the boat radio yet? We came in here... No. She attacked us before we could do anything. Okay, I'm gonna give it a try. Just hang in there. I'm gonna get some help, okay? This is all your fault. What are you talking about? You killed Brian. That was an accident. You were high on cocaine waving a gun around. What did you think was gonna happen? Well, you know what, I wouldn't a had the gun out if he hadn't a killed Logan in the first place, all right? Well, we wouldn't have even been here in the first place if you and your stupid friends didn't need to stop for drugs! You know, we got along just fine before you were around, Nani. Just fine? Yeah, just fuckin' fine. Like you're doing fine? You're a loser, Adam. Wake up. Nani. What? I just wanna go home. Me, too. Smart move. What if he gets the radio going? What if he gets in touch with the cops? Hey, Simon! Hey, Simon! I think I got it working, man. You hear that? I think I got it! Do you copy? Hello? Nani. Adam! Oh my God. Drew, Erika, what happened? Are you guys okay? You were right about Simon. He tried to kill me. Lucky Erika was there. Holy fuck. Shit! You killed Simon? I had to. What happened to him? He had a gun. Did you call the police? I mean, did the radio work on the, on the boat? No, it's broken. But why would, why would Simon wanna hurt us? Leave me alone. What now? We wait till morning? What? It's almost sunlight. We can start walking. Fuck this, I need a cigarette. Stay here. Such a dick. What was that? We didn't have another option. You're a fuckin' idiot. Oh fuck, it's Mondo. I'm not staying up if Simon's not staying up. You were right about Simon. He tried to kill me. Lucky Erika was there. You killed Simon? I had to. The truck wouldn't start. Now does anyone else find that a little suspicious? We didn't touch your car. I'll bring the car around. Great. Simon, why don't you come with me? You killed Simon? I had to. There's something wrong with Simon. He's acting funny. We didn't kill that guy right there, which means one o' your friends did! You killed Simon? Lucky Erika was there. I had to. I had to. I had to. Nani? Come on. You okay? Lay down for a little bit. Upstairs. Okay. Come on. Easy, Nani. No, not in there. Right, sorry. Just sit down. No. Listen, everything's gonna be, it's all over. No, it isn't. Yes, it is, okay? The police are gonna be here. We're gonna tell them... Drew, Drew! It's not over. What? What are you talking about? Where are Drew and Nani? Hey. Hey. Where's Nani? She wasn't feeling well. I came in here just to think a little bit. Listen, Adam's a little shaken up. Maybe we should go check on him, yeah? We should probably get our story straight before we go to the cops. I just wanna make sure that we're all saying the same thing. I think we should tell them the truth. They don't need to know that I killed Simon. We could just say that the hikers did that. No, - Erika... - No, please, Drew... Erika. I really don't wanna go to jail. No, Erika, I think its' best if we tell them the whole truth, okay? Simon was going to kill me, so you killed him to protect me, right? Fuck you! I see what you're doing. You don't wanna think that your friends could do anything wrong, so you're trying to blame this whole thing on me! Erika, relax! No, screw you, Drew! Maybe you don't know your friends as well as you thought you did. Erika, we need help, okay? Just come with me downstairs, all right? Come on. Just come with me. Erika, come on! Shit! Oh, shit! Fuck! Hey. Where're you going, Nani? You think if you go far enough, you can get back to your perfect little world? It was you. The whole time, it was you. No, Simon killed Logan. Because you told him to. That asshole deserved to die! And Drew? I didn't have a choice. And me? It's nothing personal. I'm just cleaning up. Erika!
