Oh! What is it about the dark that makes you afraid, Phil? I don't know exactly. I'm just scared there's something there that I can't see. Hmm. Do you know what that might be? If I knew that, I probably wouldn't be afraid of it. I guess that's what you mean, right? Sometimes the hardest part is admitting to yourself that something exists which makes you frightened. What made you afraid when you were a little boy? You can't tell anybody this. I had this nightmare that wouldn't go away. Michelle, for god's sake, what are you doing? I'm in session. It's grandma. If there's anything else I can do, let me know. Was she ill long? No. She... Your grandma was such a sweet lady. We're so sorry. I'm Maria. This is Jules. You're...'shel, right? Actually, it's Michelle. My dad's the only one that calls me 'shel. How did you know her? She was our employer. We cleaned her house every week. Anyway, we're really sorry. Bye. Thanks. Bye. I appreciate your being here today. We need to talk about your mother. I'm sorry. I don't think I know you. You know me. I don't think I do. You know there is still evil here. Who was that? A very troubled man. He said that you know him. We should get back to our guests. Come on. Hi, Jon. This is... Michelle. * here he comes * here comes speed racer * * he's a demon on wheels * * he's a demon... Yo! Yo! Do you have any idea what time it is? Yeah. It's 7 and 32. 7:32. Yeah--7:32-- that's still bedtime for me, not mow-the-lawn time. Mrs. Porter said it's mow-the-lawn time. Look, you... What's your name? I'm Steven. I'm the gardener man. Hi, Steven. I'm Jon Porter. That's my daughter Michelle. Oh, you're very pretty. I meant that at your daughter. Steve, Mrs. Porter passed away. She was my mother. We're here to close up the house. Oh, but I mow the lawn, and when Mrs. Porter comes back, she'll want the lawn mowed. No. She's not coming back. How about letting us sleep while you mow someone else's lawn, and then you finish this lawn later? But Mrs. Porter said the lawn is to be mowed exactly at 7:30. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure she did. O.k. O.k. Bye. * here he comes, here comes speed racer * * he's a demon on wheels * he's a demon * and he's gonna be chasing after someone * * here he comes, here comes... * this house kind of gives me the creeps. How long do you think we'll be staying here? Uh-huh. That's good. A few days? A week? Yeah, probably. Is this you? Ha ha ha! What's so funny? Nothing. It's just that you look a little... What? You look a little goofy. I was 13. I wa goofy. She's pretty. Is this Lisa? Yeah. How come we never came to see grandma that much? Oh, I don't know. You get so wrapped up in your own things. Dad... It's o.K. If you don't want to talk about what's on your mind, but you can tell me that instead of pretending it's something else. Are you analyzing me? Uh-oh. Newton! Newton, no! Bad pig! Bad! Have you thought about what we'll do with this? Oh, I don't know. Pork chops? Come on, Newton. Come on, newties. Come on. That's a good pig. No. What about this one? Come on. Let me see. It's just my sister in her underwear. I see it all the time. Yeah, but I don't. Come on. Bfp. Bfp? Now, when did you come up with that one? Best friend priority. If you say bfp, the other guy can't argue because he has to do it automatically. Oh, brother. Oh, wow. Look at those cannubies. You ever spanked to her? Oh, come on. Shh! Jackpot. You could be talking... Let's get out of here. Not a chance. Let's go. Bfp. Uh-oh. What do we have here? You guys hang out. I'll be right back. You look great. Great shape. Yeah. She's not bad. What are they doing here? Oh, these guys? They're my friends. Think she'll take on all three? That's my sister, dickhead. Don't they ever get dates? Why do they have to come with you? Lisa, you want me to get rid of them? Would you? Please? Absolutely. I'll get rid of them. Whatever you want. O.K.? Be right back. She didn't go for it, so take a little walk. O.k.? You know who that is? Yeah. It's Tony Reno. What's wrong? Oh, nothing. I was just thinking. You look like you just saw a ghost. Come on. Let's, uh, let's finish up here. No way! Now I know why people eat pork. Hi. Hi. I know this is kind of last minute, but we were wondering if-- we're going to the diner tonight. We thought you might want to join us. That's really nice of you, but-- we want to hang out with you before you go home for your birthday. I have a mess in here. You can clean up after Newton later. No. You don't unders-- how did you know about Newton, and how did you know about my birthday? Uh... She's like that. Some people think it's really creepy, but really she's o.K. We'll help you. What did he get into this time? The entire kitchen. It wa--it--it... I was just in here, and there was... He--he'd eaten all... It was a total wreck. Your grandmother loved him, but pigs can be so messy. No. You don't understand. It was a wreck. It was a total-- pigsty? Ha ha ha! I think you need a milk shake. The star. She is such a show-off. If she weren't my best friend, we'd have to burn her at the stake. Can I have another coke? Right away. Let's do it again. The fool. Yes. Anyone need an attitude adjustment? No. Mmm. Come on. You can get it. Well, hello. The lovers. Unmistakably the lovers. It's the one on top that you should look out for. That's pretty good. You must be new around here. We know most of the guys around glenrock. Yes. I'm sure we do. I'm Tony--Tony Reno. I'm Maria. This is Jules, and this-- Michelle, right? Right. I heard about your grandmother. I'm...I'm so sorry. Thanks. How did you know? Oh, this is a small town. News travels fast. Are you going to be here for long? Um... Just a few days, I think. Michelle's turning 18 next week, so she's got to get back and celebrate. Oh, well, I'm sure we could come up with an exciting celebration for you right here. Maybe you could leave Michelle your number, and she can call you if she's interested. That's a great idea. Do you mind if I sit down? Sure. Wow, that's a really cool necklace. You like it? Check it out. It's beautiful. It's yours. Oh, no. I can't keep this. Sure, you can. Looks great on you. Consider it an early birthday present. Don't we have to go do that--that thing? What thing? You know--that thing. No. I don't remember us having to do anything except hang out here. Well, I guess I should be going. Have a great time doing that thing. Catch you later. I have two words for you-- "shut" and "up"! I have one word for you--"psycho." I thought he was cute! He forgot his watch. It doesn't work, though. It looks like it's yours now, honey. * chasing after someone * * and he's coming... Hey, check this out. Oh, yeah. That's great. Maybe you should join the circus. Shut up. Hey, check it out. You've seen your sister naked, but have you ever seen her boinking? Let's go. Shh. Shh. You looking for something? We were just... We were just... Just getting lost, right? Yeah. Just getting lost. Jon, let's get out of here. Come on! Bfp. Let's go. You go on ahead. I'll catch up to you later. Protecting your sister. That's cool. I like that. It's o.K., j.J. I'll see you at home. Don't you worry, little man. I got you covered. You need to act soon. You must prepare before it's too late. I don't know what you're talking about. Your mother's death was no accident, Jon. I can't help you with this. I don't need your help. You need mine. You came to me 30 years ago for help. That's all behind me now. It's not behind you at all. I can help you stop him, Jon. Stay away from me. Hi. Hi. I have your watch. It's upstairs. Oh, hey, don't worry about it. I hope I didn't offend your friends last night. No. I--i brought these anyway. That's so nice of you. Oh! Come in. Come in. Um, I was just about to make dinner. Mmm. Looks like he had the same idea. No! No! This is my grandmother's pig. He must be very dirty. Actually, they're very clean animals... Cleaner than a lot of people. Dad, this is Tony. Hi, dad. He was just coming by to say hi, and he brought us these flowers. Anything else we can do for you? No. I'll just see myself to the door. O.k. You know, you really should be careful with that thing. You could hurt someone. I'll catch you later. O.k. What was that all about? I don't like him. I noticed. What's the deal? I just don't like him! I don't know. He reminds me of someone I used to know. O.k., but he has been very sweet to me. He tried to give me a birthday present, and he brought us these flowers. Yeah, I guess you're right. He must be a real creep. Picking up the mail? Hi, Steve. Yes, I'm picking up the mail. I used to sometimes do the picking up the mail for Mrs. Porter. Really? That's very nice of you. I'm sure that she really appreciated that. Yeah, but I didn't look at it because it's not my affairs. Right. I guess you're right. People's mail is their business. I don't look at other people's affairs because it's not my business. Well, like it's not my business to tell you who to like and stuff. Right. Well, I'm going to go inside now and take care of my business. O.k., but if you ever... Want to know what I think about that, uh... Bad guy... With the fast car, you just ask me, o.K.? I will. O.k., because he's not like... He's not like regular people. He's different. I saw him walking the other night, and then I saw him walking away. Oh, no. I mean... I saw him walking, and then... And then he was gone. Uh, right. Yeah. Well, it was really nice talking to you, Steve. Thank you. Ooh! Uh... * here he comes, here comes speed racer * * burnin' up the quarter of a mile * * he's a demon * and he's gonna be chasin' after someone... * aah! * ...Look alive Drink it, and we all live forever. You freak! I'm going to rip out your heart and eat it while it beats. No! Ugh! Let's get out of here. Hey, watch out! Oh, my god. Aah! Aah! Aah! Hey, what's your problem? You better wake on up, buddy! Come on. Let's get out of here. I got to get back to work in 40 minutes. Archer continues to pester me about her death-- trying to warn me. I can't understand that crazy old man. He asks me about an old watch Lisa was wearing when she died. I can't remember there being any old watch when they found the body. Good morning. Hi. This is going to take a lot longer than a few days, dad. We haven't even been through half of these rooms yet. Let me give you a hand. I'm happy to do it. I just don't really want to spend the entire summer doing it. Where's that watch you were wearing the other night? That necklace? Um... It's... Ha! I can't remember. Oh, great. Think we can fix it? Sure. Hold this. Grr... Oh, come on. Here. You just-- aah! Aah! Maybe we should hire an electrician. There must be some tools around here somewhere. Here it is! Aah! Aah! Ugh! Oh, Mr. Porter, you should use protection. I'll be careful. No, no. No. You should use protection. Here. These are protection gloves. Thank you, Steve. See, electricity-- electricity can kill you. These gloves-- they can protect you from the electricity-- even up to a million volts. That's a lot of electricity. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Thanks, Steve. You're welcome. Oh, no, Mr. Porter. You keep them. You keep them for a while because you may need to use them again. Well...thank you very much. You're welcome. Hello, Jon. Hello, father. Change your mind? You were calling my mother before she died. She wouldn't listen to me. What do you know about her death? The sabbath approaches. This is the only way to keep them away. Father. No! Stand back! Oh, the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak... And so my blood is growing weak, and they know that. Who knows that? Do you believe in human evil, Jon? I believe people sometimes lose their way. What a very thoughtful answer. You must feel so very safe hiding behind all that psychoanalytical blatherskite. Hear no evil, speak no evil, see no evil. Is that how they teach psychology today? Now, see this. "Dominatus..." "Este." Had not Salomon dominion over demons? No doubt he tried. The rewards are... Impossibly tempting. 30 years ago, you interrupted a cabalistic sabbath. Your sister wasn't just murdered. She was sacrificed as part of a demonic ritual. The real ones are very rare. They're very hard to track. No one knows exactly when the cabalistic sabbath occurs, which makes the task at hand... Very difficult. Yes, I can see that. Don't mock me! You already suspect that what I'm saying is true. You wouldn't be here if you didn't. Let me make something very clear to you, Jon. You can't run away from this. This evil will follow you wherever you go. It already has. If you want to stop it, you must cut it off at the source, go back to where it all started. But he died. They all died! I saw it with my own eyes. A poorly extinguished fire is quickly reignited. You must have somehow allowed them to die. Unless they die by your hand, they will come after you and take you and everyone close to you with them. He's come back to finish what you interrupted, Jon, and each time he kills, he can bring back another of his minions unless you stop him. You're saying I have to commit murder. You won't be committing murder, Jon. They're already dead. That book will show you some of what you need to know. Take it with you. The beast will work through the bloodline and sacrifice on the sabbath of the 18th year. He killed Lisa when she was 18, Jon, and he killed your mother so you'd bring Michelle to him. I've had enough of this. If you think my mother was killed, tell me who did it. A man named Jim Norman was the last man I heard of to violate the sabbath. If you don't believe me, you may want to call on him... Unless you'd rather wait for Tony to come knocking on your door. * so you better look alive * * he's busy revving up the powerful mach five * * here he comes * here comes speed racer * * he's a demon on wheels * yep, definitely looks like it's hyper-hydraulic mulch-mode time. O.k., let's do it. * here he comes, here comes speed racer * * and when the odds are against you * * and there's dangerous work to do * * you bet your life speed racer * * will be there to see it through * Uh-oh. What's wrong with the powerful mach five? Oh. Looky here. A red shoe. Where did this come from? Ugh! I got you. You can't run away like that. Now, you stay on because I can't do anything without my hat. Oh, no! Well, what do we have here? Somebody come help me... Hi, Steve. I've been thinking. We never really had a chance to get to know each other. You know, I'm not such a bad guy once you get to know me. No... Here's a question. If a gardener with a big mouth is alone in a field being tortured and no one's there to hear him scream, does it still hurt? No! No! No! No! No! Aah! Urgh! Looks to me like a bad hair day. Mind giving me a hand? Welcome back. When do we eat? You do only what I tell you to do. I've waited too long to get this right. I know we understand each other. Here. Put these on. In fullbrook, do you have a listing for a Jim Norman? No, sir, I don't. How about James? I have "j" period. Yes, yes, of course I would be interested in a "j" period. There's no need to get testy, sir. It's 555-7309. 09. Thank you. You're welcome. Hello. Hello. My name is Jon Porter. May I please speak with Jim Norman? Who is this? Uh, Jon Porter. I hope I'm calling the right number. Did Jim live in glenrock for some time? Yes, he did. Great. I do have the right number then. Is he home? My husband is dead. He died this morning. I--i see. I'm so sorry. Look, look, look, i--I'm try-- please forgive me for asking. I know it's none of my business, but had he been ill? He bled to death. It was horrible. I've never seen a body mangled like that. There was just so much blood, and I really must say, Jon, it was some of my very best work. In fact... He's bleeding like a stuck pig in summertime. There's no stopping this heavy flow. Hello. Gazette. Yes. I'm trying to get ahold of some-- of some, uh, back issues. Do you have an archives of some sort? Well, how far back you looking to go? Uh... About 30 years. You know, Jon... It wasn't very nice of you to threaten my pal Tony with that great big fire-poker of yours. That's o.K. I know you didn't mean it, but tell me something. Have you seen that poker lately? I think I stuck it to Michelle. Keep them closed. Now... Open them. Happy birthday! Is this for me? It is your birthday, isn't it? Thanks. O.k., um... Yay! O.k. Now i'm going to do your birthday tarot. Cut the deck into three piles to the left. Maybe it will tell us something about Mr. Sex hunk from the diner. This card is your significator card. Basically, it represents you. These cards are the past, the present... The future. This card represents views of others, and the last card is the outcome. O.k. Go on. Turn it. Interesting. What? The lovers. How come I never get that one? Come on. It's just tarot cards. Taro. Taro cards. Whatever. Hi, dad. What's going on here? They're having a birthday party for me. Who lit the fire? "A poorly extinguished fire is quickly reignited." Where the hell's the poker? I don't know. What's the matter with you? Nothing like a big, strong man to stir up a fire. Would you stop it? He'd old enough to be your father. Great earrings. Oh, thanks. Where'd you get them? From someone older than your father. So, anyone need anything from the kitchen? Yeah. No. Aah! Doesn't seem to be any evidence in the house. Really? What do you call this mess I just put in the ground? Well, sir, I'd call that buried. Excuse me, but that was my grandmother's pet, and somebody killed it with a fire-poker, so if you could find them, we'd all feel safer. Here's your evidence. It's contaminated. I'm not sure what purpose it'll serve covered with your fingerprints. This house was deliberately vandalized. They left some Mark in the kitchen. Which I noticed you cleaned up. I want to know who did this! I also want a complete investigation into this and any connection it might have to my mother's death. Do I make myself clear? Are you suggesting that Mrs. Porter was murdered, sir? I'm suggesting you look into it. Commingle the blood and sacrifice the girl in her 18th year. Let life leave her body at midnight and eat her still-beating heart, thus assuming the power of the beast. ...out of the mouth of the beast. He's come back to finish what you interrupted, Jon. Each time he kills, he can bring back another of his minions unless you stop him. The false prophet may sever a digit to keep the latch closed... Slicing flesh and spilling blood on the circle, desecrating the beast and sending it back from whence it came. Look, weird stuff happens around here, like, every day. One time, we drove up to the top of snyder hill late at night. It's totally creepy up there with that old train tunnel. Art... Streiber. He had his dad's brand-new Camaro. Leather interior. The most exciting part wasn't the sex. It was doing it in front of that tunnel. I felt like... Someone was watching us, like...someone I couldn't see. Speak of the devil. He's so cute! I told you he was going to come tonight. Go over there. Are you crazy? Do you want me to show you how? Watch and learn. That's a great jacket. Thanks. Can I try it on? Sure. Styling. I bet you have a great car to go with this jacket, huh? Yes, I do. And I was wondering if Michelle would like to go for a ride. Ugh. Feeling better, Jules? Don't fuck with me. Where's Michelle? Michelle left with Tony. No. She can't! No. Well, she already did. I understand, sir, how traumatic this time must be for you. It must seem easier to blame someone instead of accepting the circumstances of the accident. What the hell are you guys doing over there? Have you found anything? Why, yes. The blood doesn't check out. What do you mean it doesn't check out? There was blood all over the kitchen. I realize that, but according to our tests, it wasn't pig blood. It was human blood. Human. It's your mother's blood, sir. That can't be. It could be left from the accident. No. It was fresh. I saw it. Did your mother mention anyone bothering her before she died, anyone who didn't like her? No. Well, you let me know if you think of anything. Oh... You're not planning on leaving town right away, are you, sir? No. I'll be here. Thanks for the coffee. Facing your deepest fears, Jon? Want to know what happens to little boys who poke their noses where they don't belong? Want to know what happens when they see things they're not supposed to see? You killed my sister. Yes! And I could kill you right now, but that would be too soon. And I want you to see it this time when we do Michelle. I won't let that happen. What are you, some kind of tough guy now? How terrifying. But you weren't so tough when we took care of your sister, now, were you, j.J.? Oh, but you did interfere. That's why I've been taking such good care of your family over the years. Let's see. First there was your wife. Car wreck, wasn't it? Tell me, have you ever seen a body divided so neatly in half before? And then dad. Oh, dear old dad. Heart attack, right? Funny how that happens when you see something really scary. Mom. Well... Mom was the easiest one of all. Just set the old bitch up and knock her down. Wham bam! See you later, mom. I brought you here, fucker. Payback is a bitch. It's just I've never seen that much blood. Oh, my god. Maybe it was just some kind of accident. What's going on? I'm sorry. I didn't know who to tell. My parents are out of town. Jules isn't home. I was going to call the police-- Maria, what happened? We don't know where Steve is. I went by the school and saw Steve's lawn mower with blood on it. Then I found this. And I found these all around it. I found teeth like this in Tony's jacket pocket that night at the diner. Come on, Jules. Where are you? Sucking solo tonight? Excuse me? Do you mind if I sit down? Um, actually, I'm waiting for some... Friends. There's no smoking in here. Listen... Why don't we just get this over with? I'm sure there's a cheap motel around here somewhere. You're disgusting. Oh, that's true, but no one does the tongue tango like I do, sweetheart. Pardon me. Is this guy bothering you? Kind of. May I? Hey, pal, how about taking a walk? Fuck you. Wrong answer. O.k. O.K. Sorry about that. Hello. I'm Vinnie. I'm Maria. Maria. That's a beautiful name. Thanks. You're welcome. Do you want to sit down? Actually, I was thinking about leaving in case Romeo comes back for seconds. You have really cute ears. Oh, yeah? They're good to nibble on. Mmm. You know, I have a surprise for you. You do? Mm-hmm. Close your eyes. O.k. Surprise! Mmm. I almost forgot. I have a surprise for you, too. Oh, really? Yes. Now close your eyes. O.k. Surprise! Aah! I thought you might need some coffee. Thanks. Did you sleep? I could hear you walking around. What's the rifle for? You know, you always made it o.K. For us to be straight with each other. Yeah. Yeah, well, I think it's time for us to be straight with each other. Hello? I have a package for Jon Porter. Hello? Package for Jon Porter. I need your signature. What is it? I need your signature, please. Set it on the porch. Who's it from? From your childhood friends, jonny! Ah ha ha ha ha! Oh, that's no way to treat good old friends, Jon. You remember Vinnie, don't you? And our good buddy Sean. Ha ha ha ha! Come near here again, I'll kill you. Boys and girls, we're having a little party tonight, and you're both invited. Catch you later. Oh! Oh, my god! What is going on? Oh, Michelle. Michelle, I'll tell you everything. Who are those guys? Well, they're not human. They may have been human once... 30 years ago. They're what's left when the humanity has been sucked out of them and the evil becomes incarnate. I won't let them near Michelle. "Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof." Let us hope that ecclesiastes is true. Can I help you with something? No. I just wanted-- we've been getting complaints about illicit activities around here. Did you know that? No. I mean, yes. I came here because my friend is missing. Her name is Maria Moore. I was supposed to meet her at the diner last night. She wasn't there. She didn't call. I can't find her, and I don't know what to do. O.k., honey. It's o.K. Come down to the station and tell us about it. Let's go. Do you really think we'll find her? Of course we will, honey. Let's go. Would you like a doughnut? Sure. I'm sorry. Did I say doughnut? They're tasty and so good for you. Ha ha ha ha! Aah! I still don't understand why we can't leave. Because they will follow you! They already have the taste for you. Wait for the sabbath. That is when you will strike. What do we have to do? Desecrate him as he has done unto you. But first, you must bring me something of his... Something that he has touched... Which your sister also touched and Michelle has touched as well, and you had better do it soon. Oh, allow me. Woo! No! No! Uh! Looks like another little piggy tried to get to market. Seems to me this little piggy should have stayed home today. Would you like to know what my tarot cards have to say? Leave me alone! Aah! Aah! Help me! Uh! Shh! It's quiet time now. Where did you put it? I think it's in my room! Hurry! Within the magic circle, the false prophet must sever a digit. What are you doing? Let's go. I can't find it! What did you do with it? I don't know. Where's that goddamn thing? Oh, I got it! Let's go! I'll take you down with me! Where are we going, father? Yeah. Where are you taking us? Leave here! But we just got here. What's the matter, father? Don't like what you see? Dad? What? Come on, come on! I can't go down there again. Archer! Archer! Archer! Michelle? Michelle? Jules? Michelle, where are you? Jules? Where are you? You have to help me. Jules? No. Jules? No, not Jules. Aah! Aah! Disappointed? Desecrate him as he has done unto you. Within the magic circle, the false prophet must sever a digit to keep the latch closed. Dad? This is Tony. I want you to see it this time, when we do Michelle. I'm sending it back from whence it came. Give me your hands. Bleed for daddy. Oh...oh... No! No! Bitch. Aah! Don't you want to bleed for daddy, too? Get away from me! No! Yes! Guns are not allowed. Scared, Jon? Hard admitting it to yourself, isn't it? Aah! No! Get away from her! Shut up. Chain him. Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Michelle! You're mine now, bitch. Not this time. Hey! Aah!aah!aah! Die... You miserable fuck! Catch you later. Michelle! Oh! Good-bye, j.J. What is it? Nothing. Let's go. Well, I'm not as afraid of the dark as I have been. Can you think of why that might be? Not exactly. I--i guess it's about realizing what it is that I'm really afraid of, like if I'm afraid to talk to Julia. What I'm really afraid of is that she'll laugh at me and make me feel like a jerk. Can she do that? No. I do that to myself, I guess. Good. Good. I've been thinking a lot about what you said. Sometimes the hardest part is admitting to yourself that something exists which makes you frightened. Is everything o.K.? Yeah. Everything is fine. Ha ha! I'm back again.
