Oh, yeah. They always suggest writers and I always say, "Get Larry Sloman to do this, he's the only one who gets it." In some respects, I was Patient Zero in this virus that became "Hallelujah." So four years ago, I'm sitting in your house and what amazed me was when you showed me your books. The documentation of these songs and how these songs go through this amazing process. Especially with a song like "Hallelujah." I mean, book after book after book with verses. Well, I always thought that I sweated over this stuff. But I had no idea what sweating over this stuff meant until I found myself in a shabby room at the Royalton Hotel, trying to finish "Hallelujah" and not being able to finish it. And I remember being in my underwear, on the carpet, banging my head against the floor, and saying, "I can't do it anymore." "It's too lonely, it's too hard." Do you think everybody takes this much care with a pop song? You know, you can't begin to understand "Hallelujah" without investigating the long, winding path that got Leonard to a place where he could tackle a song like that. I-I mean, Leonard didn't really even start writing songs until he was about 30. This month, a new book was published in Canada, the titleBeautiful Losers, the author Leonard Cohen. There are those of the audience who know Leonard Cohen perhaps primarily as a poet. His eyes through my eyes Shine brighter than love O send out the raven Ahead of the dove... Leonard, in fact, wishes not to be a poet but a kind of modern minstrel. He's become very excited by the music of the mid '60s. And recently, his joys and sorrows of living have come forth as simple, beautiful and sometimes sad songs. Let's listen to one of them. ♪ It's true That all the men you knew ♪ ♪ Were dealers who said They were through ♪ ♪ With stealing every time You gave them shelter... ♪ That was the very first time he sang on television. The novel was coming out. And then they said, "He's going to sing too." And we said, "Oh, sure. Why not? And then we'll talk about the novel." You must admit that, for other people looking at you, Leonard Cohen, the poet, the novelist, the scion of a Jewish family from Montreal, pop singer and writer of pop songs... All of these things, um, they may certainly add up to Leonard Cohen, but they do look rather complex at first. Well, I think, that, uh, you know, the, um... The borders have... Have faded between a lot of endeavors, like the poet or the singer. All those kinds of expression, I think are completely meaningless. They don't mean anything to me. It's just a matter of what your hand falls on. And if you can make what your hand falls on sing, then you can just do it... I didn't know him very well then. I didn't know whether he would hang in there with it. After all, I knew, and everybody did know, that he came from a wealthy family in Montreal, that he'd grown up in a lot of privilege, and was he a dilettante? Was he going to drop this and say, "Maybe I'll study law"? Or whatever. ♪ And leaning On the window sill ♪ ♪ He'll say one day You caused his will to weaken ♪ ♪ With your love and warmth And shelter ♪ ♪ And then taking From his wallet ♪ ♪ An old schedule of trains ♪ ♪ He'll say, "I told you when I came I was a stranger" ♪ ♪ "I told you when..." ♪ I came down to New York and I visited some agents, and they'd say: "Turn around, kid, aren't you too old for this game?" I was 32 at the time. And I didn't have very much success in getting the ear of anyone. Please welcome with me a great songwriter, poet, novelist and friend, Leonard Cohen. So, Judy, how did you and Leonard Cohen wind up on this stage together? Oh, my... Well, Leonard came to me in 1966, and he said, "I can't sing and I can't play the guitar, and I don't know if this is a song." And then he... He sang me "Suzanne." And I said, after he finished: "Well, that is a song and I'm recording it tomorrow." It's a great thing, because I had played it for somebody in Montreal, and they said: "No, there's a lot of songs like that." ♪ Suzanne takes your hand ♪ ♪ She leads you to the river ♪ ♪ She's wearing Rags and feathers ♪ ♪ From Salvation Army counters ♪ ♪ And the sun pours down Like honey ♪ ♪ On our Lady of the Harbor... ♪ It was on an album of mine calledln My Life. And "Suzanne" was the one that kind of drove it over the top. So I said, "Well, you can't hide in the shadows anymore. You have to come sing in public." And I had a date here. And, uh, it was a big fundraiser for WBAI. Everybody was here, I think Jimi Hendrix was on the show. It was a whole bunch of people. Judy kind of talked me into doing this. She invited me out on stage, and I started singing, and the guitar was completely out of tune, and I was scared anyways. So rather than humiliate myself, I left. He said, "I just can't do this." And he walked off the stage. Terror. Ha-ha. Sheer terror, and everybody loved it. I mean, they all love you when you fall apart. You know, they have... They get so excited. ♪ You want to travel blind... ♪ So I came back with him, and then we finished "Suzanne" together. ♪ For she's touched Your perfect body ♪ ♪ With her mind ♪ The audience was generous. It was just nerves. So that was the first time, and after that, you know, he became known for his voice and singing his own songs. - Standby. - Okay. Just a sec. I think you're starting a little slow, Leonard. - Right. - Standby, please. There was a friend of mine that said, "John, there's this poet from Canada, he's a wonderful songwriter, but he doesn't read music, and he's sort of very strange. I don't think Columbia would be at all interested in him, but you might be." So I listened to this guy and... Lo and behold, I thought he was enchanting. John Hammond brought Leonard Cohen to see me and... I do remember that meeting. Maybe it's our common Jewish ancestry, but I related to him. And John said, "Leonard is an original." Take four. That he's a poet and that he will make his own way in a special way that's unique to him. Just a sec. Leonard, excuse me. That's over 20 seconds. I don't think the introduction should be more... No, I wasn't thinking of it that long. I just want to get into it before I started singing. I didn't have it, in terms of an introduction. Take five. He was Leonard Cohen. No one walked in his path. He didn't walk in anybody else's path. Bravo, Leonard. Would you like to listen to it? Yeah. People are always telling me: "Why don't you do something like you did two records ago?" I just don't want to repeat myself. To me, the only really exciting thing about the work is finding new forms. So I will keep on trying to find new forms. I met Leonard in Montreal... in 1972. I was performing in Montreal at the Hotel Nelson, and it was like a happening. Everyone in town was there. The place was exploding. We were there for a week, and it was sold out. They were lined up around outside. And this quiet guy comes over in a black suit and stands there, one hand in his pocket. We started talking, he was very complimentary about how exciting the music was. Would I be interested in talking with him about recording? I said, "I'm heading back to my place in New York." "Well, I'll come down." I was 22? I was unknown. But we hit it off. And he played me some great songs. And immediately I sensed that these songs were different. Leonard's songs felt cinematic to me. ♪ I remember you well ♪ ♪ In the Chelsea Hotel ♪ ♪ You were talking so brave And so sweet ♪ ♪ Givin' me head ♪ ♪ On an unmade bed ♪ ♪ While the limousines ♪ ♪ Wait in the street... ♪ And right away, I said: "Boy, we could record these and sort of drape them in a dream, like every one is a vignette of life." And he sort of liked that idea, so within a couple of months, we recorded, I guess it was eight or nine songs. ♪ I asked my father ♪ ♪ I said "Father, change my name..." ♪ This wasNew Skin for the Old Ceremony. It was the first thing that I did with Leonard. ♪ Covered up with fear and filth And cowardice and shame... ♪ In terms of the actual musical style of the record, a great deal of it is due to John Lissauer. He's a very young man and certainly the most interesting musical mind that I've come across in many years. ♪ Lover, lover, lover Lover, lover, lover ♪ ♪ Come back to me... ♪ We finished the record and put together a band and went on tour. It was a small band, just the five of us. And we did a lot of cities. We did all of Europe. And then, after we toured for about nine months or so, Leonard asked me if maybe I'd like to co-write an album with him. I said, "How do you want to do it? You want to sit around together, or do you want me to take your poetry and essentially set them to music?" And he said, "Well, let's do that." And he said, "I'm gonna be in L.A. for a couple of weeks. Why don't you come join me? We'll go to the Chateau Marmont, get a couple of rooms and write." ♪ I came so far for beauty ♪ ♪ I left so much behind... ♪ So I flew out there, and he had a piano in the room. We came up with six songs. It was gonna be an album calledSongs for Rebecca. It was thrilling. We had rough vocals on everything and arrangements on everything. It was in pretty good shape. And he said, "All right, I'm going to go to Hydra for a couple of weeks. I'm working on a book of poetry, this and that... I'll call you when I get back, and we'll finish up." And I didn't hear from him... for eight years. Hello? Leonard? Yeah. Hi, this is Larry Sloman. I was a young reporter for Rolling Stone Magazine in '74, and I got the plum assignment of doing a piece on Leonard. Leonard? Yeah. What's your schedule gonna be like? Let's make a definite appointment for tomorrow morning. Do you get up early, or do you...? No, I usually sleep pretty late. I'll tell you what, I'll probably stay in Queens today 'cause I have my stereo out at my parents' house. Shall I call you or...? I don't have a phone. Tell me what time you get up. I usually get up around 11. So I'll probably get into the city around, let's say, 1:00 tomorrow. Okay, I'll see you then. Good. I became almost like an obsessive. I mean, I literally stalked him for three days. And after the first night of the first show, went back to his hotel room, just kept peppering him with questions for two hours, and he was so gracious. He was, I think, 40 at the time. He said, "Wouldn't it be wonderful if I could just keep doing this?" 'Cause, you know, we never see the mature man chronicling his life. He says, "It'd be great to hear that experience on the stage, and really, you know, my goal is to become an elder." Leonard was thinking about those issues when he was 40 because he was exploring his Jewish roots. And in Jewish tradition, I think you could start studying Kabbalah when you're 40. You have to wait till you're 40 to have that life experience to be able to understand Kabbalistic thought. ♪ Who by fire ♪ ♪ Who by water ♪ ♪ Who in the sunshine ♪ ♪ Who in the nighttime ♪ ♪ Who by high ordeal ♪ ♪ Who by common trial... ♪ I was so touched as a child by that kind of charged speech that I heard in the synagogue, where everything was important. The world was created through words, through speech in our tradition. ♪ Who in these realms Of love... ♪ When we were young, Leonard would say very proudly that his grandfather could take a pin and put it through the Torah and know every word it touched on every page. ♪ Who shall I say ♪ ♪ Is calling... ♪ Leonard Cohen once told an interviewer that he was thinking of changing his name. When you're a famous Jew, you change your name. So that's the deal is, you don't want to be too Jewish 'cause you'll get in the way of your fame. Have you ever thought of changing your name? Yeah, I was gonna change my name to September. I beg your pardon? I was gonna change my name to September when I started writing songs and singing them. Leonard September? No, September Cohen. Oh. But Cohen is such a standard name. Yeah, well, September is pretty standard too. Not for a first name. No. Well, I thought that, uh... You know, I always had this feeling that new things are beginning. And I thought that I would change my name and get a tattoo. September is how you say Elul to a non-Jew... 'cause Elul is the month of Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur. This is... This is the deepest time when God's on the throne and we're down here, and we come to God with broken hearts and God's mercies heal us. So I think he wanted to say... Leonard Elul. You know, Leonard, the man who's immersed in the world of the month of Elul. ♪ Who by brave assent... ♪ When I was standing beside my tall uncles in the synagogue, and the cantor would catalog all the various ways that we've sinned and died, that moved me very much. ♪ Who by his lady's command ♪ ♪ Who by his own hand... ♪ When my father died, after his funeral, I found myself writing some words to him. Then I took one of his formal ties and I slit it open with a razor blade, and I put this little note, this little poem into the tie, and I buried it in the garden. ♪ Who by high ordeal... ♪ I think that was the first time I ever used language in a sacramental way. ♪ Who in your merry, merry Month of May ♪ ♪ Who by very slow decay... ♪ Unlocking the mysteries of life was his primary preoccupation. So if you had any questions along those lines, he was... He was the guy to talk to. I had been working in Los Angeles as a session singer, and then Leonard invited me to go on the road with them for the Field Commander Cohen tour. I was the other singer with Jennifer Warnes. ♪ Like a baby stillborn ♪ ♪ Like a beast with his horn ♪ ♪ I have torn... ♪ I was, you know, very, very young. But I came in and felt an immediate warmth from Leonard. So we spent a lot of time talking about his overall philosophy of life. ♪ I swear by this song ♪ ♪ I swear by all That I have done wrong... ♪ He was very attuned to human suffering around the world, even though he was relatively comfortable in life. And he was constantly aware of everyone in the world who isn't comfortable. ♪ I saw a beggar He was standing there... ♪ When you see the world and you see the laws of brute necessity which govern it, you realize that the only way that you can reconcile this veil of suffering, the only way you can reconcile it to sanity is to glue your soul to prayer. ♪ A pretty woman leaning In her darkened door... ♪ He was really on a quest to find his path, his spiritual path, and he tried a million things. Well, I've been studying with an old Japanese gentleman for many years. Roshi had a Zen center over in Europe, so he came out and he rode with us on the bus. There were a lot of wonderful things in my own culture, my own training, but always in the back of my mind was some kind of resonating presence in my heart. ♪ I have tried... ♪ Some sense that there was something that could be healed. ♪ To be free ♪ I remember once I was musing on purgatory, and I was fearful of it. And he said: "This is purgatory." And he meant the whole scene, what we're living. And at the same time, he would say what an amazing experiment this is. We were very young then. Even then, it was about the brokenness of the community that we both had come out of. They had a lot of rules. You went to school, you got married. You had children, you lived in a nice house in Westmount. That was written for us. This is a song based on my extremely boring and pathetic life at Westmount High School in Montreal, and it's a song that I wrote a couple of years ago with Phil Spector. ♪ Ooh-wah-ooh ♪ ♪ Oh-oh, oh-oh ♪ ♪ Ooh-wah-ooh ♪ ♪ Oh-oh, oh-oh ♪ ♪ Frankie Laine He was singing "Jezebel" ♪ ♪ I pinned an iron cross To my lapel... ♪ I'd been hearing that Leonard was going to record with Phil Spector. Leonard's experience with Phil Spector... That whole thing, I think, was Marty Machat, who was Leonard's manager at the time, also managed Phil. So he put them together. I always got the sense that Marty didn't like me, I was too young, it was something I just sensed. Maybe Marty didn't like my hair. And so when Spector came along, he was a legendary producer, he might have been the most famous producer in the world. It was record producer as star. So I said, "Boy, I guess they got the real guy." "Enough work with this kid, we're gonna get the real pop ringer." ♪ I know you're hungry ♪ ♪ I can hear it in your voice ♪ ♪ And there are Many parts of me to touch ♪ ♪ You have your choice ♪ How did you feel about the album? Oh, the album is a disaster. The songs are good, but Tina Turner should have sung it. Or-or Bill Medley. And working with Phil Spector was a little tricky. Spector imposed his "Wall of Sound" on Leonard. ♪ But don't go home With your hard-on ♪ ♪ It will only Drive you insane... ♪ It had bombastic orchestration, and a lot of people thought that the music was competing with the lyrics. And, you know, with Leonard, you gotta hear the lyrics. That happened, uh, at a curious time in my life because I-I was at a very low point. My family was breaking up, I was living in Los Angeles, which was a foreign city to me, and I'd lost control of my work and my life. I think the breakup of his relationship with Suzanne was a very painful process. Leonard, talk a little about "Gypsy's Wife." In a sense, the song was written for my gypsy wife. ♪ And where Where is my gypsy wife? ♪ But, uh, in another way, it's just a song about, uh, the way men and women have lost one another. That, uh, men and women have wandered away from each other and have become gypsies to each other. ♪ I said where... ♪ "Suzanne," I've got to ask you about because there was a Suzanne in your life, and she's the mother of two children. But you wrote a song called "Suzanne," and someone told me today that that was not about her. No, I had written the song before I met this particular lady. I guess I summoned her. So it was another Suzanne? It was another Suzanne, yeah. ♪ She says your body Is the light ♪ ♪ Your body... ♪ You have a great reputation that goes before you, and perhaps in your wake as well, for being a ladies' man. Is it well-earned? You know, I'm the last one to ask. No, you're the only one I can ask. ♪ So where... ♪ I would have jumped off a bridge for Leonard. I would have done anything because I adored him. I didn't have a love affair with him. I mean, he was wonderful. Handsome... intelligent, mysterious, dangerous... I mean, once you're past 25, you sort of know. So I knew that. I knew dangerous when I saw it. ♪ It's too early For the rainbow ♪ ♪ It's too early For the dove... ♪ Leonard had a way of putting women on a pedestal. He, I think, saw women as part of the path to some kind of righteousness or enlightenment. ♪ And there is no man ♪ ♪ There is no woman ♪ ♪ That you can't touch... ♪ We are irresistibly attracted to one another. We are irresistibly lonely for each other. And we have to deal with this. And the other side of that is the same appetite for significance in the cosmos, where each of us understands his solitude in the cosmos and longs for some affirmation by the maker of the cosmos, by the creator. ♪ Where is my gypsy wife Tonight? ♪ One of the reviews I was reading said that... Leonard's whole career has been pulled between holiness and horniness. So let's talk about women. What was your first love? - My first love? - Childhood sweetheart? Sixth grade? An older aunt? You never change, do you? I was 50 years old when I'd first fallen in love. Fifty? I never knew what it meant before. I'm going to be 70 next year. No way.Yeah. It's not funny.

When I asked him, he said that he'd been working two years already on "Hallelujah." Then he wrote a part in Paris, you know? When he was staying in Paris. And a part in my house. You know, he was often starting with this song. In the morning, first thing, coffee, then working on "Hallelujah." I really love when Leonard's doing a work that is really... bringing you all sort of emotions and breaking your heart, and filling your heart after it's broken. You know, I don't know, it's just beautiful to... To be able to hear such poetry with such beautiful music, you know? Would he try verses out on you? Asking me? No, he was never asking, but he was playing in front of me. But I was not really like somebody at a concert. He was working. I was working a lot. We were both working a lot. So I'm part of that landscape. I feel it like that. You are just a person, or you could be the dog or the cat at the moment where there was inspiration. It's so mysterious. "Hallelujah" is like a symbolist poem, you know? It's obscure. It's very obscure. I always see "Hallelujah" like a bird that is flying in a room, and sometimes touching the walls of the culture. It's like a... a riddle. Ratso knows more than me. Oh, yeah, yeah. Of course. The last time we talked, we were talking about "Hallelujah." And this is something... You've been working on this for as long as I've known you. Yeah, yeah, I've been working on that song. And I think I-I have notes in my present collection of-of notebooks. Oh, okay, here, here. "When David played His fingers bled He wept for every word he said You hear him still You hear him singing to you" Endless variations. Even here, it says: "Baby, I've been here before I know what rooms like this Are for" "Baby, I've been here before I know this room This crooked floor" And "Baby I've been here before I know this room I've walked this floor" I mean... These are all the "Hallelujah" songs. Did he ever mention how many verses he might've written? For some reason, the number 180 comes to mind. It might've been 150, but it was a lot of verses. Sometimes I think that I would go along with the old Beat philosophy: "First thought, best thought." But it never worked for me. There hardly is a first thought. It's all sweat. No, but, I mean, you are kind of... transmitting the experience... or passing it along to another generation. What is the experience? It's the experience of, uh... of work... and of failure. And, uh... You just try to lay it out as accurately as you can. I hadn't seen him in eight years, '76 to '84. And so my Leonard days were done. Except in 1984, I get a phone call. "Hey, John. How are you?" He said, "Do you want to make a record?" Going back to Lissauer to produceVarious Positions, that may have been occasioned by the excesses of working with Phil Spector. Lissauer, the arrangements were much more subtle and much more elegant, and it really, I thought, brought out the nuances of the lyrics much better. It was very surprising but oddly... uh, comforting at the same point. I must have always known that we weren't done. Hello? Now, at this point, he was in New York on a semi-regular basis, and he was staying at the Royalton. So he said, "Come on up to my room. I'll play you some songs." So I'm in the Royalton, and he's got his guitar out, but he also has a little device on his table in front of him. Not quite as many cymbals, but he goes... I'm saying, "What is this?" So I'm saying, "Jeez. That's kind of like Kurt Weill meets, um... You know, it's Berlin in the '30s or something." And at first I thought that he was sort of putting me on. I mean, it's a Leonard Cohen album, it's... It's, uh... tactile and acoustic and serious and deep and historic. I said, "This electronic stuff, that's just like a post-disco thing." I remember studio sessions with Leonard... and John. I remember their relationship, they were laughing a lot. Leonard is very intense but with no show-off of the intensity, you know? He's, like, producing this incredible performance without intending to say, "Oh, look at me. I'm going to do something great and difficult. Please, I want concentration." It's a real creativity. ♪ Dance me Through the curtains ♪ ♪ That our kisses Have outworn... ♪ Columbia had asked that we do a record that would put Leonard on the American map. And we had this song, "Hallelujah," which was pop song-like, and it reached out more. It just had... a more contemporary possibility to it than a lot of his stuff. ♪ Hallelujah... ♪ I could see how great it was. And as soon as I sat at the piano and we started to do... Again, kind of a gospel 6/8 feel, which eventually is... And my favorite spot is the big hole in the end where it goes... The last time through it, really just, you think, "Oh, please do something." ♪ Now, I've heard there was A secret chord ♪ ♪ That David played And it pleased the Lord ♪ ♪ But you don't really Care for music ♪ ♪ Do you? ♪ When I first heard it, it had the verses that are on the record. And that was it. And I never, ever asked him about his lyrics. I didn't ever say, "Explain this to me," or, "Does this have two meanings?" All the things that people wanna know. "Jeez, what did he...?" ♪ ...composing Hallelujah ♪ I wanted to be the audience. I wanted to make of the lyrics what they were to the listener. I didn't want to know too much. And I didn't want to... I think it's insulting in a way to ask someone to explain his art. It has to explain itself. ♪ Hallelujah ♪ We're all thrilled with this record. And there's so much to it. There's three unbelievably great songs on this album, and I said, "We've done it. This is really good." And I think Columbia is gonna like this. They're gonna be happy. They had their anthem and they had a pop tune in "Dance Me." And it had stuff that could catch on all over the place. And I said, you know, "This is it." And, boy, was I wrong. Sit down, my friend. Now, your album is called Various Positions. I know it's available in England, I found out. But why can't we get it in America? Columbia Records didn't want to bring it out. Why? What happened? They have a transorbital frontal lobotomy? It was time to present the record. Uh... And they brought it into the new head of Columbia, Walter Yetnikoff. Yetnikoff was not a Leonard guy. And he pretty much hated it, heh. I visited the chief executive of Columbia Records. And? First of all, he reviewed my suit. Then he said: "Leonard, we know you're great, but we don't know if you're any good." Really? That record album never came out in the States, did it? No, Columbia Records refused to put it out. Why? He said, "I don't like the mix." I said, "You mix it, Mr. Yetnikoff. If that's what's going to stop you putting out the record, you just mix it and put it out." To me, that was so disgusting and terrible and heartbreaking. Yeah. Yeah. TheVarious Positions is the positions of the little will. We sense that there is a will that is behind all things. And we're also aware of our own little will... to succeed, to dominate, to influence, to be king. And from time to time, things arrange themselves in such a way that that tiny will is annihilated. I remember that he was crushed after that. All his work that had been so intense and doing something so precise and so beautiful, and then they say, "Oh, no, no. We're not interested in this." It's horrible. It's horrible. It was like The Twilight Zone for me. You do something you're absolutely sure is one thing, and someone else sees it... as reversed as possible. I said, "Boy, I must have no sense of the music world... to be this wrong." And suddenly, everyone thought it was wrong. And Marty made me feel that I had somehow ruined Leonard's record career. He walked in, thinking it was the greatest thing ever, and he came out and it was my fault. My record career with Columbia was pretty much done. So I basically stopped making records with this album. At some point, someone said: "Yeah, you're not working in this town again, kid." To me, that was such a Philistine move. I mean, it-it just symbolized everything that's wrong with those assholes who run music labels. I don't think that the rejection of an album after it's paid for... happens that often. That's pretty extreme, yeah. I have no idea why Walter rejected it. Obviously, the album included one classic. The work is done. And it's really good, man. It is impeccable. The stuff's down in black and white. Whether it comes out or whether it's seen. I'm telling you, this is all for the books. I feel I have a huge posthumous career ahead of me, you know? My estate will swell. My name will flourish... I mean, you know. Look, "Courage is what others can't see, what is never affirmed. It is made of what you have thrown away and then come back for." I don't think that Leonard ever believed that he was not any good.
