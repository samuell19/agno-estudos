Back in the Indonesian Premier League. Two sensational and classic teams awaiting to be the leader of the league. Jakarta Metropolitan will face the guest Maung Lodaya, ranked fourth. A match that's highly anticipated by the Metropolis who already packed Metro Sports Center since this afternoon. The return of Bambang Pamungkas makes this afternoon's sensational match even more special. Bambang Pamungkas is an extraordinary player. He crisscrossed the Europa League, seven years with Fiorentina, four years with AS Roma, and two seasons with Borussia Dortmund. I think he will still be the backbone for the Jakarta Team. This is Hasyim Kipuw. Players from Jakarta Metropolitan. After failing to be taken by Yokohama Marinos with phenomenal numbers. He should just put the ball in the corner. It's his instinct, sir. He's a striker. Hey! Put the cigarette out! -Sorry, sir. -Whereas, that's the second chance, sir. He shouldn't do that. The referee isn't good. -Come on. Who are you betting on? -Jakarta Metropolitan. Okay, sure. -One hundred thousand. -JakMetro will get a yellow card. -Stand still, faggot! -You have small balls! Your ass! -Want more coffee, sir? -No, that's enough. -Mrs. Mega wants a drink. -Okay, sir. I'm watching it. Mr. Edy, there are guests from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Tell them to wait. Tell them I'm in a meeting. Yes, sir. Here's a letter from the Vice President. Yeah. Just put it in my office. -Yes, sir. -Ouch. Sir, why don't we watch it at your office sometimes? Your TV is big. -It would be nice. -You can watch it at my office. Is it fun to watch football alone? Referee, where are your eyes? -He shouldn't be offside. -He is in a good position though. -I didn't cross the line. -Offside! It's been like this before. -Referee. -You're offside. Hey, watch it carefully. Fool, you can't even score goals. I already gave it to you. -What do you want? -Enough! Pass it to your friends. GO8! Hey, get up! What a crybaby! Hello, sir? Okay. Are you betting on a high or low score, sir? Oh, a low score. Pardon? Okay, then, sir. Thank you. Hello, sir? This is an MU match. In this match, MU handicap quarter. Dragon Cup horse racing. Lane five, right? -Okay, sir. -Twenty thousand? Let me repeat. MU handicap quarter in this match, sir. Andin! -Did you see that? -Oh no. Gabriel missed. His accuracy is 89.7%. He carries out the ball from any difficult position. I'm sure. Are you sure? Roy Lie was one-on-one with the goalkeeper, but he couldn't score. Roy Lie never was World Cup Top Scorer. I'm sorry, sir. The proposal we submitted to our American investors was rejected, sir. They said our proposal is not profitable, sir. Of course, it's not profitable. If it's profitable for them, it would be unprofitable for us, stupid. Make a new proposal. Go to Washington tomorrow. One way. -Don't come back until it's done. -Yes, sir. Okay? All done, right? -Yes, sir -Out. -Indonesian football progressing. -What? Gambling is rampant. -Are you sure? -Yeah. Gambling has nothing to do with decreased performance. The Calciopoli Scandal in 2006. Italy still won the world championship. The market put handicap half for Bandung. Jakarta is the one to beat. No goals since earlier, right? Bepe is very accurate. It's just a matter of pattern. Bepe plays inward. That's why Gabriel is alone at the front. The Bandung team plays tight. No wonder there are no goals. Still, if they draw, anyone who bet on JakMetro will celebrate. The cheering could be heard from the Metro Sports Center. -Hey, press them! -Press? I'll press your face. You stupid striker! Can you actually play? You need to practice more! -Ball! -Ipung! The goal is celebrated by supporters at the Metro Sports Center Stadium. It's offside! He's great, sir. Good. Even in his mother's womb, my son's kick was very hard. A goal scored by Gabriel. Gabriel! The score will draw, sir. Just wait. Hey, don't be a smartass. We'll see. GO8 will score two more goals. But the Jakarta market is a draw, sir. It's said that the referee, striker, and keeper, are already handled by the bookie, sir. Hey! I have managed the operations of Vice President's office for 30 years. Never once did I, Edy Baskoro, graft people's money. Player number eight is my son. I educated him for 23 years to be an honest person. So, don't you be a smartass! The current position of Jakarta Metropolitan. Maung Lodaya, thank you. It's only been a few minutes. There's still a second half. -Yes? -Hey, it's already Thursday. Check the balances. Did we lose a lot? We're gaining a lot. It's good, but don't be lazy, okay? Find other men, the big and strong ones. Pay attention to the Korean League. Jeonbuk Motors against FC Seoul -is coming soon. -Okay. -Yes? -Hello? -Roy? -Yes Are there any bet openings? -What? -Bet openings. -Wait. -China, Thailand, Japan, anything. -Wait, I must take a look -Okay. -Roy? -Yes What's taking you so long? Just a moment. Be patient okay? -You're late. Already sold out. -What? You're late. Already sold out, but there's one left. What? -What? -What's remaining? Tokyo FC, Yokohama FC. Just about to start. How much are you going to bet? The market bet no handicap. The market bet no handicap. Tokyo FC, Yokohama FC. -Okay. -It's just about to start. -Okay -Okay what? How much are you going to bet? I'll wait for my instinct. It's useless talking to you. There's no money, you're just talking. Keep asking like a guest. Shit! Come on. This is the pro league. More subtle than a district game. The play is smooth. That's why when our league was bad, there was no gamble because it couldn't be gambled on. The quality was poor. Who knew they would score a goal! Don't be too emotional, okay? Stop him, referee. PSSI is a den of corruption. PSSI is a gambling den. PSSI is the nest of corruptors. PSSI is a gambling den. PSSI is good-for-nothing. This is a very unique match. It keeps happening at football matches. -Supporters break in, -Right. and so many other distractions, but so far… Attention! Mlenge and Christopher, you're playing well. Keep it up and don't give them opportunities. I've told you so many times. Spread out when you are attacking, but don't forget to defend. It's so messed up. Gabriel. You should realize. Every time you move, no matter where, three or two opponents keep clinging to you. Back off if you see that happening. You need to bring them back. Since the 1990s, almost all matches in the world were fixed. Nothing is clean, except for the amateur league. So, you mean that… JakMetro and Bandung earlier were held? And all the kicks were arranged so that they wouldn't score? About being arranged, it's for sure. Even more so the player. Miss. -Okay. -Thank you. -Which edition is this? -Last month. -This one? -Special edition. -You know Gabriel Omar, right? -Yes. He's my friend. -Your friend? -My childhood friend. Have you seen his practice video? With such accuracy, he can score the ball from every difficult angle. It's up to him. But he's a human. There must be a failure rate. Human error. Wait. His accuracy is 89.7%. There's no way the failure rate was that high. Okay. Come on. Get up. Okay. Listen up. The first half is over. We all know the result. Now, we still have 45 minutes for the second half. -Okay. -Let's pray. Prayer begins. Prayer finished. We are leading the game with 1-0. And I want us to go out from here -with a victory! -Jakarta Metropolitan! Come on! In a moment, the kick-off for the second half, live from the Metro Sports Center. Filled with 48,000 supporters from both sides. -Okay, Lodaya -I support Lodaya. Maung. I'll bet 50,000. -Gabriel will hit the goalposts. -You bet a lot. -I bet 50,000. -I'm in. I've told you, you have small balls. Don't talk about yourself. Referee! Hey, I got the ball. Look at him. -Look at him, referee! -Gabriel, take it easy. Be an honest referee! Gabriel! You have to keep calm. Don't get provoked. What a deaf referee! Shit! Hey! That's good. Be patient, my son. No wonder, sir. The referee is stupid. No wonder he's being called a shit. You're the stupid one. Don't be rude. He's trying to calm down Garbriel Omar, but it looks like… Hello, boss! What's wrong? Can't that kid be controlled? -Arrange it like before. -Relax, boss. -Football must also have drama. -How much do you want? -Calm down. I already handled it. -Shit. The rules are still the same, right? I'll bet a million for Jakarta. Pass! Hey, you! Do you see it? Since when have I played this? Get back here! You shit! The mode is the same. I'm sure it's a draw. -Draw? -Right. What do you do other than this? It's a simple theory. JakMetro is six points away. They're still in second place. Missing two points is not a big deal. Stock prices are stable. Then, if they play like this, the players and supporters are still happy. -That's a note for me. -Take a note. One-on-one, get ready. One, two… -Move! Everybody moves! -You want to pick a fight? What the hell are you doing? You stink! I'll give you the shirt with my signature. I don't want it. It's corrupt. -Asshole! -You're the asshole! You shouldn't bribe to enter the club. Who's your father? Red card! Calamity! Jakarta Metropolis' nightmare comes true. He's been provoking him. -Calm down! -Referee! Okay. Enough. Back to your position. He also has to get a card. -This. I know it. -One person. -One person. -Oh, I see. -It's not deducted. -This is not fun, right? METROPOLITAN Stupid referee! Shit! -Roy! -Yes? Double the bet for Bandung. -Double the bet for Bandung? -Yes. -You ask me or you want to place a bet? -Place a bet, stupid. -Okay? -Alright. -Put me in. -Okay. I'm ready to treat you to "fuck you" steak. Wagyu! Oh no. You arranged it so well. Double my money for Bandung. Also, value my car for Bandung. Okay. Hey, don't take a photo if you can't afford it. Do you think this is an amusement park? DADDY Hello, Dad. I've told you many times. High winds blow on high hills, Son. Why are you getting provoked? That's usual business, Dad. -It's not important. -You… You don't usually act on that. What is going on? Nothing. It's West Derbi. We always clash when we meet. Son. Our football is similar to Europe. Back then, when the Ungaran Team competed against the Semarang Team, I scuffled with the opponents. You don't have to worry. I can handle this. Gabriel Omar just got a red card. Son, did you hear that? Did you hear what the commentator said? Control your emotions. He's right. -Yes. I'm watching it now. -Okay, then. Stand close together. Don't spread out. Stand close together! Roy? I bet 3,000 for Bandung. I'm in. Okay. Why are you betting so small? Only 3,000? Don't you know? Three thousand means three million. Three hundred thousand means 300 million. You bet another three million for Bandung? Are you crazy? I have guts. Don't panic. -You have an account on the website? -I do. Then why did you call? Why don't you bet immediately? It's troublesome. It's better through a bookie. He places it through an agent. Do you want to place a bet? I know the agent. Really? Okay. Wow. You're getting interested. This one is called a game. -What? -Is that the bookie? Maybe. Look closely. You said you know him. -Yes, it is. -Are you sure? I'm sure. Be careful. I'm serious. You sure it will be still a draw? You have too many theories. You can do it! Go on. Hurry up. Okay. Thank you, all. Thank you. That was the press conference from Maung Lodaya. Next, Jakarta Metropolitan. What are infotainments doing here? They are also reporters. Don't worry. What reporter? Bepe, any comments about the match? Well. Thank you, and good afternoon, guys. -Good afternoon. -I think we did pretty well. Our team is solid. Coach Bram had no doubts about it. But if something goes wrong, I think it is quite normal because football always makes room for human error. Coach! -Go ahead, sir -Okay, Coach Bram. What kind of provocation got GO8 so emotional, Coach? Only God knows what happened to them. And as we all know… Gabriel Omar is a professional player. He knows what the consequences of his actions are. Coach! -Go ahead, sir. -Coach! Is it true that Coach Bram and GO8 often meet in secret places? You can't say that! These are personal matters. Why did you ask that? -I think it's inappropriate. -Sorry. You can't ask that. -Let's go. -Sorry. -Coach! -That's all for today. Thank you. I was born to be the best. I have winning genes. Okay, GO8. Because of seven goals, reportedly, there are about five top European clubs who are prepared to offer you long-term contracts. -Are you ready to play in Europe? -Of course. Since I was a kid, my dad always… Gabriel. He's great When the time comes, I will definitely play there. Nice. Don't just say nice. Have you collected money from Arwin? -He's always running away -What? He always runs away, boss. So, he hasn't paid yet? Not yet, boss. Have you told the operator to not pick up his call? -Not yet, boss -He said not yet, boss. -How much does he owe? -Eight kilos, boss. Stupid. That means eight billion. When it comes to commission, you're fast. -When you have to collect, you can't. -He takes your money. Search until you get him. -Yes, sir -The world is small. He doesn't know how deep the ocean is. Aren't you going to meet the governor tonight? Later. The "drop" hasn't arrived yet. -You guys just wait here first. -Yes, sir. I have new stock, but if you want to puke, do it in the bathroom. Yes, sir. Hello, Mr. Emir? I'm from a soap company. We want to ask GO8 to be our product's commercial star. Can we? -What is it, miss? Soap? -Yes. Washing soap. We are not suited for such products. But our soap is different. We have DAB and bar soap. Are you interested? We dare to pay dearly. What is the fee for GO? Forget it, miss. We're not interested. Money can't buy everything, ma'am. Uncle, thank you for your time. Thank you very much. -Don't get bored. -Sure. -Gabriel. -Yes. I'll wait to hear from you. -Thanks, bro -Okay. -See you. -Come on. Hey, Mir! I'll go home with Daddy. -Uncle -Hi. Gabriel. Can we have your autograph? -Okay, wait. -Give your comment, Gabriel. -Come on. What do you think? -Another question. ASIAN'S MAGAZINE -I'm leaving, Din. -Bye. My chest hurts. -Be careful, Gas. -Yes, sir. -You're not home yet? -Nope. By the way. You are in the papers, not for football but because of women. About the parties. I know times have changed, but people's opinions are still the same. -How do you know, Dad? -Well, look at this. Here's the proof. Read that. This is what reporters do when they lack news, Dad. Do you think they'll always lack news? What are you researching? By the way, who's this? -The Minister of Youth and Sports. -Sir, I'm going home. Next to him. I don't know. Maybe Robby Tumewu. I don't know the language. Robby Tumewu? Wrong guess. Pram! Can you translate this? "The Minister of Youth and Sports and businessman Aheng Halim Suhendar working together to build a sports facility in Cisarua." -Who was that? Aceng? -Aheng Halim Suhendar. Who was your childhood friend? -Andin? -Right, Andin. She's a reporter now. Reporters are all the same, Dad. -They have nothing to do. -The poor girl, Son. She had the same dream as you. She wanted to become a footballer. Unfortunately, in our country, there are no female footballers. You're right, Dad. She was desperate to move to Brazil. Then? She wanted to be a footballer there. But fortunately, she passed the football newspaper reporter's test. A real wealthy businessman. He has a cigarette factory in Kediri… Okay. …a spare parts factory in Shenzhen, tobacco terrain in Temanggung. If I'm not mistaken, he has a 9% share in Jakarta Metropolitan. Seems serious. Looks like he still has many other businesses. Son, wake up. Soon, we will be free from this traffic. Sudirman Street is not crowded. Thank you. Okay. "Their cooperation commitment is worth about two trillion for contracts over the next 50 years." After that, it'll be taken over again by the government. Okay. Thank you. Pram. Aheng and the Minister worked together, right? -Yes. -See you. Bye. Thanks, Pram. So what is the biggest hindrace, Sir? Actually, the biggest is in the historical aspect, because… If devaluations happened. The government has gone mad. Sir, the magazine. Don't take it away. I only have one. Oh no. The car has broken down. Daddy. Just get a new car. You have had this one since I was a kid. Why are you still using it? You don't have to worry about money. Choose whatever car you want. This car is irreplaceable, Son. This kid. Don't you remember? When you first started practicing football, I drove you in this car. When we got to the stadium, you didn't want to get out of this car. The engine will start soon. Go on. Just go inside. -Ouch. -Does it start, Dad? Hey, Son. Your late mother's birthday is in three days' time. Don't forget. We will have dinner together, okay? -Okay, then. Go inside -Yes, Dad. Hello, Coach? Yes. I'll be right there, Coach. Don't score more than one goal. When we're against Melbourne Rovers, don't score at home. It's easy. Honey, why are you so late? Hey, babe. You must be very tired. Wait. Take your clothes off. Why didn't you invite me? -Hey. -Oh shit! Instant noodles shorten your life. -It's hot, man. -Clean it up. It didn't spill, only on my hand. Shorten life? More important to not shorten the dick. This is the food of our nation. From emergency tents to luxury apartments, everyone eats this. But still, it's not healthy. You are the athlete, not me. You have to stay healthy, not me. But you're my representative. So, you also have to be healthy. So, where have you been today? I've been your manager for so long. Of course, taking care of business. -How's practice? -I just got home from practice. It's not cooked yet. What did we get now? Let's see. There is a drink advertisement, being the speaker of the International Youth Conference, a sausage advertisement, and underwear advertisements. -Where do you want me to start? -It's up to you. You're my manager. You arrange it. There's no money in being a speaker. Your expression is changing, I know. But this is good for your image as a successful youth. Hey, come on, man. Listen to me. The drink advertisement is also interesting. I've turned down the sausage ad. It's junk food. Gabriel Omar Baskoro, a World Cup top scorer, -how can he eat junk food? -I want that underwear ad. I thought so. Gabriel Omar Baskoro. GO8. The youth idol. Occasionally, it's good to show your curves. Only you are able to make all mothers willingly let their daughters lose their virginity. A mother comes with her daughter. "Go ahead, Mr. GO. Please 'taste' my daughter." -Enjoy it. -You really are a pervert. How much is it worth? Worth? Four billion for two years. -You can still negotiate. -That's not bad. -Anything bigger? -The bigger one is the sausage ad. Five billion and they only want it for a year. Hmm. The pay is indeed good. But you should still be a role model. I maintained your image for two years as an accomplished young person. Healthy, bad boy, a bit arrogant, but inspiring. It's true. If someone is accomplished, he can be arrogant. Money can be earned from any hole. Your idea is great. -Let's go look for a "hole", shall we? -You go. I'm not in a mood. I'm in the mood. No star wants to look like a bad boy. Everyone wants to look good. Humble. But what's in the end? Money. We have to do something else. We are different. We must be different from others Agreed. Eat this. It's sour. -Want to buy more shirts? -Yes. Okay. Which one do you want? Ansyari, okay? Number eight. Try it first. -It's good, Dad? -Yes. It's good. Let me see. When you grow up, you have to wear the original national team shirt and the captain badge on your arm. Sure thing, Dad. I'll be the captain. That's my boy. Tawan Sripan and Kiatisuk Senamuang are stopped by our midfielder, led by Fahri Husaini who currently plays in Vissel Kobe. -What is their line of defense? -It's incredible, Widodo. Widodo, Kurniawan, and also Rochi Putiray. -Goal! -It's an incredible goal. Fifty percent still in our grasp, Man! A hard kick released by Rochi Putiray. -Excellent breakthrough bait. -You got that right, Man. The goalkeeper stares at the goal that is happening. -Good afternoon, sir -Good afternoon. There is a package for Andin. Okay, please fill in the guest book. -Thank you, sir. -You're welcome. Mr. Supandi. Please deliver this package to Ms. Andin. Yes, sir. Hello, sir? Yes, sir. I'll be right there. Okay, sir. -Mr. Kaswan -Yes, sir? Please give this to Ms. Andin. Just a second. -Here. Thank you -Sure. Hello, Coach? About yesterday's offer, Coach. Yes. I understand, Coach. But… Uhm… Could it be if…? RESTU BOOK STORE -Mr. Dayat. -Mr. Edy. -How are you? -I'm fine. How are you? -How are you? -I'm fine. RESTU BOOK STORE The new edition of Politikana has already been published, right? Sure is. Politikana. Here it is. Not good. This nation is still corrupt. You can say that again, sir. As long as you still bribe when breaking traffic rules, don't say anti-corruption. -What about you? -Well, not intentionally. If we don't go with the flow, they will give us trouble. What's this magazine about? -Which one, sir? -This one. This is good. It's news about the Premier League, which is said to be professional. It turns out to be the same. -They accept bribes too. -"Bribery scandals arise." What is this about? About the emergence of bribery scandals. Gosh. This is what happens when sportsmanship gets to know money. It's dangerous. -It's been a long time in Europe. -Right. For example, Juventus. Their title was finally stripped. -That's right. That was… -Around 2006. Right, 2006. They also ask why the players don't leave the team. -Because everyone gets paid. -Well, then. -I'll buy this one. -Only this? -How much? -Okay. Give me a plastic bag. Hopefully, this isn't happening in Indonesia. Hi. Andin, I'll check these photos first. -I'll be there later. -This one, okay? -Yes -Okay. See you. Yus! Andin. This is bad, Andin. This is bad. Boss is mad at me. Please check your work. -What? Why me? -Yes. -What's wrong? -I don't know. Thank you. Andin, put your clipping here, okay? Okay. After lunch. Okay. -Hi -Andin! What is this? -Morning. What are you doing here? -Andin, give your article right away. Andin, come on. So the writing can go up at 3 p.m. Okay. I'm waiting for your coverage. Why are you late? Okay. Did you stay here all night? Did you stay here all night? Who is this from? -Someone sent that to you. -From? I don't know. -Wait. -Did you got the receipt? Who brought this to me? I don't know. It was there already. -What is it, Din? -What happened to you? My God. Bram. Coach Bram. Congratulations. We remain in the first position. And this season's achievements are better than last season's. During the same week. On the stock market, our club is still in a pretty good position. We just bought two good players. I think, for the next season, we don't need to buy any players. -Yes. -Agreed. Gentlemen and Mrs. Mega, you can call me arrogant, but the fact is, I've made this club two times Asian Champion and three times National Champion. And with all your compliments, I think it's appropriate if I submitted a new employment contract value. Bram. We just renewed the contract last season. And it's quite big by the Indonesian football manager's standard. My goodness. Indonesia. My standards are way above Asian managers. You all know that. So, it's natural for me to propose an application for an increase in my work value. Bram, but don't you forget. We agreed to talk about this next season. -Right? -Look. Last season, five years period. In that contract, there is a clause stating there will be another adjustment if the club's performance increases. It true. Bram, everything has been written in the contract. And remember, it stated that after the end of the season, we will discuss it again. -It can't. -Right? This is just the ninth week, Bram. Come on, Bram. How long have we known each other? Right, you're not new in our club, Bram. Twenty years. -There it is. -Right. Dimas Bramantyo. The best player in this club. Even five years in Asia. Okay? And I am the inventor of our football maestro. Gabriel Omar and Bryan Arya. Their contract value, it'll be amazing if you sell it. This is clear to see. And in the history of this club, Dimas Bramantyo is the best player for three years. What else? Good day. Okay. So. Excuse me, sir. Ms. Andin wants to see you. Andin? Hey! -Hi, Andin. -Hi, Uncle. -How are you? -I'm fine. Please, have a seat. Would you like a drink? -What do you want to drink, miss? -Just water, please. Thank you. -How are you? -I'm fine, Uncle You haven't been here for a while. -You good? -Yes, I am. You're fine, right? Thank God. What is it? Just a visit, Uncle. I haven't been here in a while, right? And there are some things I want to ask you, Uncle. -Maybe you can help me. -Sure. -Just a second, Uncle. -Hm. He's a minister. But I don't know who this is. Isn't this Bramantyo from JakMetro? Right. That is Coach Bram. Here's another photo of Coach Bram. You can see it. Did Toge ever tell you about this? Toge? Oh, right. Only you call him Toge now he's grown up. He told me that he really wanted to be a champion in Asia. And I also told him, someday, you have to be the captain of the national team. -Amen. -Amen. So, Toge never told you about the mafia in PSSI or the match fixing that's happening in our league? What do you mean? Well, look. When a strong team plays against a weak team, the score is usually close. The goal happens on average around 75 minutes of play. Although this team won against other big teams in the previous weeks. It's been happening in Europe for the last two or three years. It's also happening in Indonesia. -I'm currently investigating it. -Wait a second. Are you alleging that Gabriel is involved in this? Forgive me. I didn't mean it that way. I'm just asking whether Gabriel has ever told you about this. Or maybe about what's inside this black bag, Uncle. How would I know? Maybe it contains dirty clothes after their training. Andin. Twenty-three years. I know Gabriel. I educated and raised him. There's no way he would disappoint his own country. -Forgive me, Uncle. -I told him every night that football unifies a nation. Football is the pride of the country. Football is something big in this world. Even bigger than poverty alleviation programs. And I pounded it in his mind constantly. So, it's impossible that Gabriel Omar would hurt his own father. Or hurt his country. Take it back inside. Andin was about to go home. Pardon me, I'm reading this newspaper. Maybe, someday you can come here again. Uncle. This is just information for you. My search for the mastermind for this match fixing has led to one person. Maybe you have time to look at it. I'm leaving. Hi, Coach. Here. Here. Arwin Wardhana. It's hard to find you if you're in debt. So, when will you pay up? Soon? I know you won big elsewhere. Do you want to deceive me? Win, I'm in no mood to break someone's arm, so I didn't look for you. Settle it immediately or do you want to courier your finger to me? Hence, don't gamble. You won't get rich. Instead, you're in debt. Mr. Bald, the change. Good. Ramdani, don't push it. Watch out. Be patient. Three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. You have to be ready. There is only one way to reach victory. Discipline, hard work, teamwork, and one thing. Cultivate imagination. Without imagination, you are useless. -Do you get that? -Yes, Coach. If you can move your mind, then your nerves will follow. So that the direction of your kick is accurate. Gabriel, why are you not concentrating? I don't want this team to be weak. -Understand? -Yes, Coach. Bambang, you've been in Europe for 13 years, right? Yes, Coach. Thirteen years. You gained a lot of knowledge. -Pass it to your brothers here. -Yes, Coach. Coach, can you give me five minutes? About the involvement of the mafia in match fixing in our league, Coach. -What do you think? -Yeah. I've heard rumors about that. But look. I believe that all professional sports are vulnerable to money, but I won't let my players or my team get involved in dirty play like this. Enough? Coach, but… -But what about the issues… -By the way. If any of my players are held by the bookie, I'll kick them out. Note that. Can we take photos together? Oh, wow! Attention! BOR says they are proud of us. That means our cooperation is getting solid and stronger. And I'm proud of you. Chirs, how is it? It's getting better? Better, Coach. Just change with the horse's leg. -Tonight. -Don't worry, Coach. By the way. We won't have practice today or tomorrow. It's free time. Thanks, miss. "One rotten apple spoils the barrel, Brother Bram." I remember your father said it. Back then, you were a kid, but your kicks were hard. Everyone clapped when they saw you running fast like a deer. Magnificent Yes. I'll never forget that, Coach. You came to my dad and convinced him that I was the future of Indonesia. Yes. I remember that. When I said that, he ran to the side of the field, grabbed the flagpole, and ran. -"Freedom! My son can join this team." -Gosh! That's my dad, Coach. He's a big nationalist, even in this era. He's very happy, Coach. He brought me to Jakarta so that I could play in Jakarta Metropolitan. Too bad I failed the test at that time. Yes. You were still a kid. How old were you then? -Nine years old, Coach -I see. But when you were 13 years old, you joined this team. Who put you on the team? Everyone already knows. Coach Bram. No one can forget that. Coach. There's one thing that's bothering me, Coach. What can I do for you? I'm still thinking about the match against the Melbourne team. You don't have to think about that. Tonight, I want to celebrate our tenth year meeting each other. At the same place. The tree is still there, right? Let's eat. -It's a foreign team, Coach. -Don't worry. -Just let it be -I can't, Coach. Wait a second. Hello? Yes, hello? Rahmat? Yes. Just use my yacht. I'm not using it right now. Raja Ampat? Cool. Relax. I'll catch up in my private jet. DEAD Now, the score is 1-1. If this situation continues until the end of the match, we're leaving for France soon. Buramil is a very capable coach. I am sure he will take us to France. Now, we see an attack from them. I think we can still win. Soon, we will qualify for France. Hendro Kartiko made a mistake. There seems to be a misunderstanding with Aples Tecuari. What happened? We see an unbelievable goal. And our flag is visible… -Son? -sitting helplessly at the other end. -Where are we? -At the hospital, Dad. Daddy, the doctor said you can't watch a football match. It makes you nervous. It's not good for your heart, Dad. We lost, Son. We lost again. Our country doesn't need to be a rich country like Japan or England. As long as our national team can enter the World Cup, our nation will be happy, Son. Don't be sad, Dad. When I grow up, I'll bring Indonesia to the World Cup. Okay? Promise me, Son? You really are my good kid. -Hey, Ms. Andin. -Mr. Emir. -How are you? -I'm fine. A rising young reporter. You exaggerate. Exposing the affair between Ryan Gigs and Syahrini. You did it, right? Revealing that John Terry had a second wife from Indramayu. What brings you here? -I just want to visit, can't I? -Visit as a friend or as a reporter? If as a friend, you can go ahead. If as a reporter, the manager must know -what the questions will be. -As a friend, Mr. Manager. -Andin. -Ge. Andini Zulaikha. -You're sweating -That's right. I'll take care of your business. Remember, she's a reporter. If you have a slip of the tongue, it's dangerous. Don't worry, she's my childhood friend. Good. -How are you? -I'm fine. What have you been up to? But first, have a seat. Special for Ms. Andin. You're too much. Tell me. What did you do now? Gabriel! Come over here. Let's swim. Come here. Keep us company. I'm writing an in-depth report on the football business. And the money involved in this industry. How much money is involved? Huge amounts. Last season, it was around 3.9 trillion. That does not include unofficial rates. Unofficial? What do you mean? Gambling. Does that exist in our football? Are you pretending or you really don't know? -Can I record? -Go ahead. Okay. Gabriel Omar Baskoro. The footballer who, according to the Football Center, has an extremely high accuracy goal rate. But why does Gabriel's performance seem to be arranged lately? Arranged? It's not. Did I get arranged when I was in Brazil? In 13 weeks, we had 11 games, and I scored eight goals. What other striker can do that? Please, sign my shirt. Then… Why did you say the data in the Football Center doesn't fit me? Spill it. That's not what I mean, but… The discrepancy is very high. When you are up against a stronger team, you play more aggressively -compared to against a weaker team. -Andin, listen. The team that feels they will lose, they will definitely play harder and stronger. A team that is sure of a win, will remain calm. So, is there any gambling in our football? Professional football is a capital business. All of which are driven by money. Gambling also involves an unlimited amount of money. Even in the big European leagues match fixing happens. Ordinary people can't see that. Including in Indonesia? You know it yourself. Ge. Ge, why do you ignore me? I am just asking. Hey, what's up? Hey, what are you asking? This is for you. Someone from the UN came just now. I said you were busy. I made an appointment for Monday. Okay? You just need to do small talk. I've taken care of the rest. That's right. She kept me busy. By the way, I'm having dinner with Dad tonight. I'm leaving now. Send my regards to Uncle Edy. What? I'm leaving, Mir. Thank you. I read about match fixing in football magazines for the gambling market. Does that happen in our country? Maybe, Dad. Maybe? Don't you know about it? Or maybe it doesn't happen in Jakarta Metropolitan? The salary is quite big, Dad. And the money from advertisements. -What else? -Right. Indeed. But a human never feels satisfied. Money has no end. If money has an end… Soeharto stepped down in 1979. That's why I'm asking you, Son. Because Daddy knows you're quite picky about advertising. -You're the one who taught me. -I didn't. Emir taught you that. He says it's all about image. He has a point. But are you sure? That you're not involved in anything like that? It hurts, sir. -Ouch. -Sorry, sir. Okay. Dad. You haven't watched football at the stadium for a while now. You're right. When are you going to play? Well. You are changing, Daddy. You forgot my schedule. Sunday afternoon, Dad. Please come. I can't go on like this. -What's wrong, Andin? -They keep coming to me. Calm down. I just want to write an article. I just want to write an article! Andin, calm down. You shit! Calm down. Calm down. Come on. Put down the knife, okay? It's okay. Calm down. It's okay. Put down the knife. Have a drink. Have a drink. Here. Have a drink. Here. Have a drink. Come on, Andin. It's okay. Have a drink, Andin. Calm down, okay? I've told you. Stop investigating. I won't stop. My story is true. You know my story is true. -Zulfikar knows my story is true. -Calm down. They know my story is true, so they're afraid. -You're right. -Shit! Calm down, okay? -Have you called the police? -What for? It's no use. Nothing will change, right? The police are part of it. They're just as bad, right? -Also bastards, right? -Calm down, okay? -The thing is, these are facts. -Yes, Andin. Look at this. See? Read this! YOU WISH TO DIE? I was attacked with a sickle. They want to kill me. No one wants to kill you, Andin. Enough. You don't know anything! Okay. Calm down. Just calm down. Now, take some rest. This is my first match. Yes, mine too. Are we safe? -Only in Indonesia. -It's a problem for Indonesia. -But it's okay. -Yeah, no problem. Why? You know why. -Are you scared? -Should I be scared? -I'm not scared. I'm a real man. -No. -I'm not sure… -Because I'm not scared. -your face is like… -No, my face is okay. No problem. -Like a chicken. -No, not like a chicken. -It's okay. -Why are you crying? -I'm not crying. Why am I crying? -You are crying. I'm a man. I don't cry. Gentlemen, the supporters are only a few meters away. Don't be afraid and surprised if they bang on the vehicle. The derby that is always riotous. Ending in a riot. Jayakarta Metropolitan. During the last three meetings, the clash between the supporters was inevitable. The umpteenth meeting in the Jayakarta Metropolitan derby. The two teams are both in the same city trying to show who's the best. So the supporters of the teams always clash when they meet. Inevitably, making it troublesome for the police and security forces… The Indonesian supporters. We have been to the World Cup, yet they still act primitively. -Bet on Jayakarta. -Put in there. -Okay, so fussy! -Min! -Jayakarta, right? -Of course. Police. Don't move! Put down the weapon. Put it down! Good afternoon, football fans. We're back for the Indonesian Premier League. Live from Arcici Dome Stadium. The match that has been highly-anticipated, of course. A sensational match in the capital, where Jayakarta FC will be up against Jakarta Metropolitan. It is one of the most anticipated matches in the Indonesian Premier League between the two teams residing in the capital with a long history. With the players they have known since childhood. They competed in the nearby academies. Now, they have to compete in two different teams. Different uniforms, histories, and achievements. And an interesting story is Gabriel Omar. He started his career as a junior player for Jayakarta FC. Of course, this was a match that was full of intrigue and historical value for GO8. He was always very interested in both teams. Gabriel Omar studied for a long time with the youth academy in Jayakarta. He is now a star playing for Jakarta Metropolitan. We are heading to the field for a deciding party for the host Jayakarta FC. An attack from Jakarta Metropolitan. Trying to press the players. This time through the legs of GO8. The tight defense from Jayakarta FC. A foul happened right at the end of the Jayakarta FC penalty box. Dumb referee! But what we regret from the home players is that many players from Jakarta Metropolitan were provoked. Service opportunity this time. Bambang Pamungkas! Instantly change positions with a very beautiful goal. Bambang Pamungkas gave Jakarta Metropolitan a 1-0 lead. There. Get over there. Uncle! Excuse me. Uncle! Come here, Andin. There's an empty seat here. Yes. Here. Right Andin, I want to take a photo first. -Do you want to take photos there? -Yes. Isn't it forbidden to bring food from outside? No, Uncle. They still keep traditions. Right. Tradition. Shit! Yes! Nice. Joko Sasongko is indeed an extraordinary goalscorer. But we have to see. The process of the goal is a very neat collaboration between players. A heated match between two capital cities in today's match. Suddenly, there's a hard kick. Will the referee count it as a foul? And Jayakarta FC got a yellow card! Dumb referee! That's also bribed, right? It's also bribed. Here. You have to look at this one. -See? -How did you get that photo? It's weird. Okay. We'll look later at the office. Crazy referee! There was very strong contact earlier. Ruben Sanadi. Once again, as the captain, he had to separate… Gabriel Omar changed the position to 2-1. Nice! …and one player out… Oh shit! -Hey, be careful. -Shut up! -Relax, boss -I'll pay for it. So how was the final decision…? The camera snapped more than 40,000 people in Arcici Dome. You bastard, Roy. GO8 used his hand. Considered the angelic hand of Gabriel who scored a goal and changed the position to 2-1 for Jakarta Metropolitan. Uncle. -Uncle. -You don't want to see Toge? Later on, Uncle. Oh. If only Gabriel had not scored a goal. Surely our position has been fixed by Surabaya. You don't even know about Toge outside the club? About what? Professional football is a capital business. All of which are driven by money. Gambling also involves an unlimited amount of money. Even in the big European leagues match fixing happens. Ordinary people can't see that. -Including in Indonesia? -You know it yourself. -Coach! -Any comment? -Coach, any comment? -I've been interviewed. Why keep doing interviews like this? -And I don't want -Toge! my players constantly burdened. Toge, what happened earlier? Ge, please give a comment. Toge! It's a private matter. Don't bring it up here! Toge! Everybody, listen! I'm a striker and I know how to score a goal. But it was clear that you scored a goal using your hands. You came, Dad. Did you watch the match? Andin. Andin. Didn't you see Gabriel's dad's reaction earlier? Did you see what happened just now? You're crazy. -Mr. Budi? -Yes, sir? -Move back a bit. -Yes, sir. Slowly. Hurry and turn left. We can through here. It's clear. Go. Oh my God! He went this way. You die! Ge! Goal! You're a smart boy. You deserve to be a great footballer. -Right? -Yes. I'll buy you new shoes. -Okay? -Yes. I once promised you to bring Indonesia to the World Cup. Hm. Next week, our team leaves and we will bring pride to the nation. Help! Help! Keep strong, Gabriel. Gosh! Please accept my condolences. Keep strong. You have to be strong. DEEP CONDOLENCE. Gab. Last night, I heard about Andin's investigation. But I didn't believe it right away. Our country has been filled with too many corruptors and con artists. Gab. Your father is the best. He's a government official. But he never changed his car. He only used that. Your father is the most honest person I have ever known. What are you actually doing? The practice of bribery, gambling, football mafia involved in match fixing at the Indonesian Premier League. So, what did you get? Evidence that many VIP's in this country are involved? Is that it? Even the Minister of Youth and Sports is involved. Government officials, their kids, wealthy businessmen, they are all involved. -I have the lists if you want it. -I'm responsible for this place. The nineteenth floor called me twice and told me to warn you. -Get it? -Warn me about what? Stop investigating this story. That's all. -And the reason? -You don't need to know. Oh. No reason, but you told me to stop? -This is very risky. -But this is good news. I'm the one who decides whether this is good news or not. That's my authority. So, please, don't waste your time. -No. This is the truth. -Andin. That's not the problem, Andin. That's it. Enough. You just look for other news. What are you making news like this for? -It's too risky for you. -For two weeks, I almost died. How is it? Everything under control? You arrange how to make Melbourne win this week. I don't know. You know better. Is player number eight still manageable? I know his father just died. Work is work, man. Remind him, then. Okay. Just handle it, okay? You remember that 10% of my bet is for you? Where? You're crazy. Smart. We're in a safe place. Okay. Turn left? Okay. Go straight. Okay. The second turn, right? -Are you a collector? -You're right, sir. -The rock is beautiful. -Of course. It's a blue sapphire. I got a souvenir from my in-laws. From Macau. This one, I don't know what it's called, but I got this when I won the bet. -It's good -Beautiful, right? -Hey. -Hey. -Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you too. Please sit. -How is it? -Relax, Coach. -Have a drink. -No, thanks. I'm in a hurry. Now, it's the international market. You have to make sure the superstar can be handled. Don't worry. If you fail, you know the consequences. Has he ever failed? Thanks. Peace be upon you. Keep going. Come on. Gather around. Why is Gabriel training alone? Looks like he's really dropped. Last night when I met him, he was silent. I was afraid to say something wrong. Coach, may I have a minute? At Fiorentina, we were used to never being satisfied with what we achieve. At AS Roma, I was told that football was a sense of competition and a mentality that will never give in. At Dortmund, they taught me that football is a business that never forgets the roots of tradition and basic philosophy in playing. You're still young. Your career will be better than mine. Further away from me. You have to remember, a winner will never give up under any circumstances. Alright, bro. Someday, if you play in Europe, you have to show that Indonesia is a big country that stands firm in the corner of Asia. Thanks, Brother. Okay. Come on. Good afternoon, football fans. This is the party that The Metropolis has been waiting for. As a big fan of Jakarta Metropolitan, where the Asian Champions League brings together… How much the handicap? Okay. Put 50 kilos for Melbourne. Don't laugh. Money doesn't know the country of origin, Roy. Okay, sir. Two thousand for Jakarta Metro. The market is the Jakarta handicap quarter. But it's K-5, sir. So, you're in? You're in for 50,000? Okay. The market is Jakarta Metropolitan handicap. METRO SPORTS CENTRE GO8 "CAN DO IT" And heading through the Melbourne net. A quick goal was scored by GO8. Hello? A fantastic goal scored by Gabriel. Hello? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Hello, boss? Yes. Shit! Have you received my money? Why is it already 2-0? This is only the first half. I have to calm down. Stupid! Tell the manager to kill the superstar! His father will be proud. Thank you. All these foreigners will definitely lose. That foreigner is a former motorcycle taxi driver behind my house. You have to stop scoring goals. Christopher. Do you understand? Spread up. Go inside. He did it! A fantastic goal scored by… Have you called Bram? What do you mean don't make it too obvious? Take him before he messes up in the field. What a stubborn boy. You have to press! Well, I have spent millions on your investment. You crushed Lazio to the bones! Jakarta Metro was supposed to be a piece of cake, right, mate? Look, we'll see what we can do. All right? I don't want to fucking see what you can do! Just break his fucking legs! Be his shadow and do whatever it takes. Go! Just fucking listen to me. Just fucking do it, all right? You heard me. Bepe! Why did the player change again? What are they doing? Just stop him. What makes us confused is almost all the players… It's because the player change! Roy, the progress is fast. Hurry up and arrange it. Why don't we attack? It's the second goal for Melbourne Rovers. Do something, man! Play for once and don't kick the ball too much. Even he dared to do very hard body fights. But we'll see the referee didn't do anything to Hara. And again the play-on from the referee. A clear offense against GO8. Frans Swahara who returned to be the culprit. Awarded discretion by the referee and GO8 is lying on the field. A very unpleasant view. A very hard tackling. Once again, a very hard tackling occurs. Will the referee react? It seems… Captain! This is bad! Still lying and motionless. Something happened to his leg after Frans Swahara's hard tackle. A horror tackling. What happened? Instead, the referee issued a red card for Ferdinand Mlenge. A decision that is very surprising and confusing. And it looks like two red cards. One more for Bambang Pamungkas. A very controversial decision because the host gets two red cards, while on the other hand, Gabriel Omar lay helpless. This is an unpleasant sight for The Metropolis, where the hero, GO8, grimaces in pain on the field. It's a big loss for Jakarta Metropolitan and the Indonesian national team. It seems there should be an extraordinary investigation for today's match because so many controversial decisions were made. And one important note is a player like Frans Swahara doesn't deserve a place in football. Dad, I got a medal. We'll put it next to your photo. How did you score a goal earlier? And how's the heading? Wow. It can be seen from the first reaction of GO8, a player who is so honest and often gets up after harsh challenges. He now has to lie down grimacing. We hope that GO8 can come back quickly because, usually, an injury like this takes a long time to recover. Once again, I remind you that there must be a good investigation into the match, not only against Hara but also against the referee because he seems to have ruined the values of sportsmanship. CHAIRMAN OF PSSI: WE WILL INVESTIGATE IT UNTIL THE END. CREATE BUCH OF GOALS IN BRAZIL, BOSS DON'T LIKE IT AND BREAK HIS LEG. Football again? It's going to be the same. Many cases of bribery. Indonesia was shocked by the alleged big scandal involving many VIP's. Injury to GO8 who played brilliantly in the Asia Champion match and lack of protection to him, both from the referee and the coach. Meanwhile, FIFA has set special standards for superstars, making the public suspicious. What's with Indonesian football? The fact that Dimas Bramantyo pulled the important players precisely when they're mentally superior, has raised the suspicion that Indonesian football really is led by the mafia. Because of everything that happened… Don't watch this kind of stuff. Here, take it. This time, I don't want an empty terrain. Take care of the certificate first. Isn't the business finished? It's not finished. Or if it's lacking? You add it. Just add it. Add it. Don't delay. But it's okay. What a welcome from the supporters of Indonesia who have filled Soekarno Arena since this afternoon. Dominance of red and white to welcome the return of the hero GO8, leading the team as captain. After a scintillating display against Zambia, we will look forward to how Gabriel Omar leads the red and white team for today's match. The good performance of GO8 against Zambia. Of course, it's become a question for all supporters of the red and white. Can Indonesia become a world champion? There is always hope. There is always a great prayer. For the Indonesian National Team, captained by Gabriel Omar. Ladies and Gentlemen, the President of the Republic of Indonesia. Mr. Fachrul Rozi. Indonesia! Nicholas. One from Indonesia comes forward from the left side of Wijaya, and it was pretty good, and someone comes forward, then kicks the ball. FOR DADDY Now, reverse. Handicap half. Indonesia. Indonesia. THE SCENES IN THIS MOVIE ARE PURELY FICTIONAL. THE SIMILARITY OF NAMES, EVENTS, AND PLACES IS MERE COINCIDENCE.
