There's some RPGs over here. Incoming. Rebels. So how you want to take 'em? Fast. Here you go. Need some help over here. Get to positions quickly! Get on the ground now! Ah! Over here! Ah! Uh. Ooh. Ah. Ugh! You guys, turn to the left! Go to the right! Watch out! Rush 'em! Ugh! Oh. Oh. Oh. Ooh. Ah. Yah! Hey! Uh. Uh. All I ever have to do is follow the bodies to find you. Well done, Warchild. General. We will destroy you! The Rebels will kill you, Ruechang! Release him. Why wait, when you can do it yourself. If I make one move toward you, 1,000 bullets will cut me to pieces. If this man beats me, he's to be released. Yes, General. Breathe. This might hurt a little. Ah! Ugh. Ah! That's a lesson. Perfect wedding gift. Mm, the dress is beautiful, Princess. Oh yes, this one is the finest I've ever crafted. I'm sure. My god. It is beautiful. But I don't want to wear it. Princess, uh, what can I do to.. I've been standing all afternoon. I'm very tired. I'd like some time to myself. Yes, Princess. Hoo. Halo, do you realize he'll go immediately to the tower and throw himself off? Maybe then they'll put off this wedding for a while. A thousand tailors could jump off the tower, and you'll still get married tomorrow. Doesn't it matter that I don't want to? Halo, tomorrow you take a husband and the thrown. Your whole life's been planned. I know about my duty and responsibility. But what about me? Doesn't it matter that I feel no love for this man? You and yours do not marry for love. That's for common folk. My mother and father loved each other. Times with different then. Your father was a very special man. And the people of the city are praying that you'll rule as he did. I don't need Ruechang to do that for me. A woman like you could soften a man. Ruechang is not a man to be softened. Halo, I know you want to be in love. But I tell you now, you need to grow old with a man to truly fall in love. Do you really believe that, Lily? Help me with my coat. Oh, I have more important things to do than help you get into trouble. I wish you wouldn't go. Tomorrow I'll be married. I may never get to go again. I'll be back before dark. Papers. All right, let her pass. Bring some more wine, Sweetheart. Proud of yourself, huh? What's his problem? I won. Yeah, that is the problem. Now we got to stay for another round. There you go, Sweetheart. You'd rather I ended up in the pig shit? Well, let me think about it. Yeah. Second round fighter, take your posts. Move on! Hey. Hey. Who's this? Haven't seen him before? Very good fighter. He comes in once in awhile but doesn't stick around for the prize money. Looks good. Listen to this. Seem like he's the crowd favorite. Make it quick, huh? First winner, second winner, take your positions. Warchild's going to win. You'll see. Full! On! Finish him. Get it over with. Nice fight. Where is she? I told you, my Lord, I don't know. Where is she? What are you doing in my room? Where have you been? Nowhere. Where were you? It's none of your business. That's what I love about you. You remind me of your mother's strength and beauty. You have no right to mention my mother. Now get out. Halo. Get out! Now I'll go. Nobody in, nobody out. Sir! How can I marry such a man? Halo.. No. I don't want to hear any more talk of duty. That man is a beast. I'd rather slit my own wrist than marry him. It mustn't come to that. Did you just see what he just did? You think it'll be any better when we're married? No. Of course you can't marry him. Lily, I'm telling you now that.. what did you just say? You can't marry him. What do you mean? Speak to me, Lily. Are you hiding something from me? What is it? I'm going to tell you something I've never told another living soul. Your father's death was no accident. Ruechang killed him. Halo.. How do you know this? I saw him do it. I was in the room. Why didn't you tell anyone? I was afraid. I'm still afraid. When the people find out that Ruechang killed their beloved king, they won't stand for it. They will stand for it. Ruechang controls the army. There's no one with enough power to oppose him, not even you. He'll stop at nothing to sit on the throne. If he killed my father, he'll never sit on this throne. I promise you that. Hello. Hello. How are you, Sir? Remove your veil so that all may see the girl about to become a woman. Before the joining of these two, let them share wine. We will now witness the joining of General Ruechang and Princess Halo. But before they are so bound, say, for all to hear, that I, General Ruechang, do take Princess Halo until her death. I will. Will you, Princess Halo, accept General Ruechang? I'm sorry. Could you give me that again? Will you, Princess Halo, accept General.. Princess! Princess! Princess! Is she all right? I think it's just the excitement of the day. Let her rest for awhile. We don't have awhile. The room is full of guests. Marry us now. But General, it would not.. not be valid. General, giver her an hour. I'm sure she'll come around. An hour it is. General! General Ruechang, Sir! Come quickly, General. (Murmuring) The Princess is not feeling well. The wedding will be in a week. (Murmuring) Do you know where she's gone, General? She's headed east. She doesn't have much of a head start. Leave immediately. The wedding's in a week. Bring me back my bride. Mm, mm, mm. Just having a bit of a dip, are we, Miss? Yes. And I'd much rather do it in peace, if you don't mind. Oh, of course. We'll just leave you alone, then. Well? Right. But first there is a little matter. This very fine horse. You see, Miss, the thing is this horse, he definitely looks like the horse of an aristocrat. Do you have any idea who you're talking to, Soldier? No. But I've got a feeling you're gonna tell me. I'm Princess Halo. The Princess? Well, that makes all the difference. Doesn't it, Boys? Yeah! No, Miss, I'm sorry. But you are just gonna have to come with us just to make sure, like, you know? If you and your men don't move along, you'll be dealing with General Ruechang. The General? Oh. How is he these days? 'Cause I haven't bloody seen him for ages. Please, Sir, just let me go my way. Aw. Well, we might be able to come to some arrangement. I mean, we could take the horse with us. Hey, while you're down there on those pretty, little knees of yours, you could try to persuade me that we should leave you here. And we're gonna need some persuading, too. Oh, yeah. That's it. Give it to her. Hey, I'm next! Bitch! Get her! Ah! Bet that hurt! Huh? Who's that? That's Warchild. She really is the Princess. One more step and I'll kill her. Hey, get off me. I'm telling you, Soldier, I'll do it! Ow! Come to take me back? I'm leaving. And you can tell Ruechang that when I return, I'll have an army of Rebel Soldiers with me. He's going to die for killing my father. Let's go. Ruechang didn't kill your father. And you know that for a fact? It was an accident. Everyone knows it. I saw you at the front of the wedding guests. For all I know.. If you have evidence, present it. To whom? To whom shall I present this evidence? I thought not. You act like you don't know what kind of man Ruechang is. Well, I do. I've told you what I'm going to do. What you're going to do is up to you. It doesn't matter what you think of Ruechang. What matters is.. you won't survive out here alone. All right, I'll go back with you. Get my dress. It belonged to my mother. Soldier, I'm not going to jog away. Please get the dress. Tell Ruechang what I said! Help me with this tent. We got some good stuff here. You're gonna love this batch. Come on, you'll see. Yeah, that'll be a change. You're such a kidder. Now, look at this one.. got nice legs. Nah, I don't like that one. What's wrong with this girl? Don't.. Her teeth are bad. Some are missing. We got a few more over here. Come over this way. Come on. What do you, uh.. what do you got in that, uh, net over there? No, you don't want one. I'm telling you, you don't want this one. She's got.. ow. I'll tell you what I want. Christ, it's got good teeth. Might want to break her in for a little while. She needs some training. I'll give you four horses for her. Four horses, that's nothing. No, she's flawless. She's got fine hair. Look at that smooth skin. Nah, now listen, four horses is worth it. Four horse is peanuts. Four horses is nothing. Give me a better offer than that. Come on. I'll go seven horses. Seven, right? That's nothing. No, look, you've been messing with me on the last few. I'm telling you, you owe me from the last time. Don't be telling me that this isn't a good deal. It is a solid deal. Throw in two barrels of diesel, you've got something. Deal. All right, that's good. Now we're talking. The horses are loose! Look out! Come on, get me out of here. Did they hurt you at all? I'm ok. Are you all right? I'm fine, Princess. Damn. You lost a lot of blood. Can't keep saving you, you know? Where are we? I took us another day further from the city. We go to get you back to the city. I told you, I'm not going back, not without an army behind me. You fought well in the mud pit. I don't know what you're talking about. You cheated. You threw mud in my face. With all due respect, Princess, how did I cheat? Did I break any rules? No. But what you did was.. was without honor. I wasn't looking for honor. I was looking to win. But if you're going to go up against Ruechang, I suggest you learn that lesson well because I assure you he has. So you think the Rebels will rally behind you and bring Ruechang down? Yes, I do. Don't you think that if they could have brought him down he would have fallen long ago? If I joined the Rebels, they will be on the side of right. You think that'll make a difference? My father told me there are two men to never fight, the man who doesn't care if he loses and the man who knows he's right. And you know you're right. And I don't care if I die trying. I'm sorry, Princess. You talk about dying, but right now the people need a queen, not a martyr. Tomorrow morning we go back. Proceed ahead, Sir. You need to radio the city for a chopper. Who the hell do you think you are, throwing orders around? It doesn't work that way out here. What have you got there, hm? We might be able to work something out. Call a chopper. Those men were afraid of you. One obviously wasn't. He is now. Then he'll keep his hands to himself. As soon as I give birth to his first born, Ruechang sits on the throne. I won't live a day after that. Do you know what kind of life you're condemning me to? Why are you so loyal to Ruechang? He's the General. That's it, he's the General? That's it. He's the General. If I told you he was crazy, if he's a murderer, would that make a difference? When I was 10, Ruechang saved me from the work chains, put me in the military house. So you think he did you a favor by turning you into a killer? All men are killers. He simply made me a good one. Warchild, good job. Al.. le.. lu.. u.. ia.. ah.. ah. Ah! Cover the General! Hold your fire, you idiots! You'll hit the Princess! Hold your fire! Ugh. Ugh. Ah! Get in the chopper. Go! Go! Here, keep them back. Come on, we got to get you out of here. Get back! I don't want to hurt you. Go away! You all right, Princess? My head really hurts, but I've never felt better. Oh! Do you know how to fly this thing? Well, I got us up, didn't I? That could have been luck. Oh. I guess it's been awhile. Quite awhile. Where are we going. Right now I just want to make sure we're not being followed. Chopper 2 to Warchild. Turn the chopper around and.. Hang on. We repeat, turn around and return to base. We will not hesitate to shoot and bring you down. Return to base. This is your final warning. Next time, we will shoot. Return to base. You have been warned. Prepare to receive fire. That was a warning shot. We can bring you down at any time. Return to base or we will disable you. Ah. Oh. We're hit. We're losing fuel. We're going down. You've been disabled. Land the chopper now. Land the chopper now and surrender. It's not over Thank you, Warchild. Let's go. We do not wish to harm the Princess. Hold your position. Halt! You're trapped. You cannot escape. Drop your arms! Surrender the Princess. Hey, I know this one. That's Warchild. Warchild. Welcome to the Revolution, Princess Halo. No harm comes to that man. He risked his life and threw away any hope of returning to the city with Ruechang in power. They say the only thing that killed more Rebels than hunger is Warchild. He was a soldier obeying orders. How do you know he still isn't? I know. Where's the Rebel Force? You saw it as you came in. That's it, those men out there? That's it. What did you expect to find? An army. Don't look so sad, Princess. Hope isn't lost. There isn't a man or woman out there that wouldn't give their life for the cause. And when the people learn that you've joined us, then you shall have your army. That's where you're mistaken. What do you mean? I haven't joined the Revolution yet. If any harm comes to that soldier, I walk out of here. Are you all right? I'm fine. Well, looks like you're gonna live another day. Many will join when they learn you have. I believe even some of the soldiers will come over. But these people, they lack any kind of leadership or direction. Well, that's what you're here for. I don't know anything about waging a war. What is it, Soldier? What's on your mind? Ruechang knows where you are now. He'll be here within 48 hours. That's crazy. He searched for us for months, and he's never come close. He came close yesterday. And I guarantee you that as we speak, he's getting even closer. How much more of this.. He's right. He does know where we are. He'll never give up. York, I'm telling you.. Robert, they're right. Camp must move. We'll meet Ruechang another day. There's only one problem with that, though. You can't kill Ruechang. But I can. All right, let's move it. Load 'em up. Chopper will find the camp covered from the air, Sir. Get those trucks rolling. All right, let's lock and load, Boys. Right. See anything up there, Soldier? Are you still planning on leaving in the morning? At dawn. I've been thinking it over. I don't think you should. But it's the best hope. I've changed my mind. I think you're too valuable to us. These people, they need someone who knows the art of war. That's you. If I bring down Ruechang, there won't be a need for any war. We can't afford to lose you right now. Princess, we can't.. This is not a discuss. It's a command. You will not leave in the morning. What do you think you're doing, Soldier? I can't find it. We'll be moving several days south of here. But with luck on your side, it won't matter. Sir? Take this. My father said it would bring good luck. Thank you. But Soldier, I want it back. No, you stop it! Quit pushing me! Hyeh. Look. Up over there! Oh my God! Ah! Move! Move! Go Go! Ah! Ah! Oh. Corporal.. Ammunition. Bring those prisoners over here. Moving as fast as I can. Come on! Quit dawdling! Bring 'em on the other side. Bring 'em over here. What have you done with my child? Quite your damn whining and move! Load up! Move them up! Get up here. Keep moving. Go! Go! Ah! Move on. I'll take it! Colonel, back off! I gave you life. Only I can take it away. No! Don't kill him, General. Let him walk free and I'll marry you. I'll marry you in front of the entire city. No. Don't, Princess, don't! Ruechang, the throne will be yours by right. Just let him go. Walk away. Walk away. Don't make me come after you myself. Go Soldier. Please, if you love me, you'll go. Good. Easy. Take it easy. Slow it down. Are you sure he went this way? Hold it. Our friend is setting us up. All right, listen up. Crew, you stand by the Jeep.. Ok In case he doubles back. Roman? Yeah? You head down the trail that way. Right. Keep your eyes open. Ok. Ah! Hm? Emmerich? You come down! Son of a bitch. Emmerich? I don't want to kill you. You're so full of shit, Warchild. Look, you don't want to kill me. I don't want to kill you. But I don't, Ruechang will have my head. From this distance, I'd say the scope won't be necessary. Like I said, I don't want to kill you, Emmerich. Well, that's convenient because I'm in really no mood to die. Go back to Ruechang. Tell him you succeeded in your mission. We've got to come up with a plan, partner. You know as well as I do I can't go back to Ruechang without proof. I still say I can take you. General, Sir. Well? The trader's no longer with us. I thought you might want this. What do you want? I came to talk. I've nothing to say to you. Princess, I know you must think I'm marrying you for power. But it's only half true. I just know that I.. There will never be any love between us. It's Warchild, isn't it? You're dreaming of a dead soldier. Tomorrow we'll be married. We can build dream or a nightmare. Your choice. Halt! Sir. Let them pass. All right. Mommy? Give me just a minute. Mommy! Princess! What are you doing? What is this? Fine. Let me taste it. No. No, Lily. I'm sorry. Go to the wedding. I'll check her room. Watch your back. Help. No time, my Lord, no time. The Princess plans to kill Ruechang and herself. How? The wine.. the wine, my Lord. Remove your veil that all may see the girl about to become a woman. Before the joining of these two, let them share wine. After you, my dear. Ah! Oh! Is it Warchild? What's he doing? Warchild! Ruechang is a murderer! He murdered my father, killed your king! It's true! I saw him do it! (Murmurs) Kill him! All right, nobody move! Nobody move. All right, everybody, stay where you are. Nobody gets hurt. Her father was a good man and a good king. You murdered him. You want to die for a butcher? Ahh! Get in there! Ugh! The balcony. General! Warchild. Shoot him. It's about to explode! You'd better get out of here. Ah. Please, Soldier, go. Ah. Come on. Come on. Move! It's over. No, Soldier, it's just the beginning.
