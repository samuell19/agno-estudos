How are you? Thank you. Hey! Can we get some service here? Today, please. Oh, wow. Wow. Get us another round. Don't be such a douchebag, Lerato. Excuse me? - I'm sorry. - Run along. Another round coming up, sir. Bro, another round. Olivia! A MEMOIR OF AFRICA A WHITE BOY Howzit, Has the letter come? Yes, it has. Africa... A wildly plumaged bird as exotic as it is unlikely. I'm sorry? I saw you staring. Rather intently, if I might add. The last book I ever read was by the same author. Well, I must say, you look too young to have stopped reading. So... now that Zimbabwe is free again, are you feeling our homeland's dark? I saw you working the room. The way you handled yourself. Classy Zimbo to the last. So, tell me... Skies? Mutare! My mother was born there! My friend. So, tell me, um... three A levels? Two As and a B. Maths, English, History. English, geography, maths: B. But when we fled, I... couldn't finish. Well. Are you going to finish? What's the point? Nothing left. Nothing that matters, anyway. So what matters here? I finally got my shot. Congratulations. Thank you. Well, was it worth it? Every crash, every tumble, every knock, break and crack, all of it worth it. That one moment... Flying. Riding with sugar. I could do that forever. Freedom. Goodnight, my young friend. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, lion, roar! Lion, roar! Walter! Joshua! Joshua! Speak to us! Joshua! Say something. Joshua! Every scar tells a story. No two scars are the same. Some caused by hate. Others by our own misguided choices. Water, more water. Just keep him cool. Mombo, what's happening? Gently. We've got you. Only cowards have no scars. Hey, Rusty, don't touch! Let's go, let's go, let's go. Plate, plate, plate, focus, get the spices. Get the food out of the kitchen, guys. Let's go, let's go. Get your plate. Finish up, guys. It's fine... Come on, boys. Time to eat. Look at what we've organized. Ah! He has risen. Boys, help Joshua. I need to see a doctor. - My knee... - And how are you feeling? - Pain. - You need rest. No, no, no, no. I... I can't... I can't... My bike... Where's my bike? I'm sorry about your bike. It's probably in a scrapyard somewhere. No, no. Ah, no! See? I'm competing in three weeks. I need to see a doctor. Right now. - Here. - No... - And your... papers need renewing. - Asylum seeker temporary permit Now, I can help you with that. What you need is food. Hm? Now, we can talk about doctors or whatever else you need after you have eaten. Come, Joshua, sit. For our home away from home, we are grateful. We are grateful. For this food, generously provided, we are grateful. We are grateful. For family and for protection in these trying times, we are grateful. We are grateful. - Amen. - Amen. - So, now, let's eat! - Yes! Okay, guys, I've prepared something nice for us today. What do you guys think it is? - Meatballs! - No. - Come on. Vetkoek... - It's fine, you'll eat tomorrow. Does no one know? - Come on, tell us! - They call it... Maize porridge, beef stew, and spinach! - Thank you. - Here you go, Joshua. Can you believe I cooked this all by myself? Okay, my boys, my boys. Where are we going to visit tonight? Kenya! China! Germany! Congo! Germany! Africa! Germany. Okay. Come. Come, come. Everybody, come. Oh! Let's go to Am'rica! It's America, you ignoramus! Okay, okay, okay. Now, this is for some ice cream. - Ice cream! Nice. - Aha! Okay. "There is a tide in the affairs of men which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune. On such a fool's sea are we now afloat". - Huh? - Any takers? Oh! Chaucer! Oh! No. Come on, come on, come on. This is for some delicious ice cream! Chunua Achebe - Well, it looks like this delicious ice cream is going to be eaten by me and me alone. - No! - I'm sorry. - Come on! - Brutus to Cassius... Joshua is trying to say something, guys. He's saying something. Joshua. Brutus... to Cassius, in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. So... It looks like Joshua has won ice cream for everybody! Yeah! Joshua! Well done, Joshua. Who wants ice cream? I do! Me! I want ice cream! Ice cream there, ice cream there. You all owe Joshua some thanks. Thanks, Joshua! Thanks, Josh! Well done, Joshua. Thank you, Joshua. Thank you, man! Peace! Shamwari! You have to accept Jesus. Jesus is powerful! I see you've cracked your knee... - Cracked your knee... - I've been waiting here for a while! Cracked your knee several times before. Not good news, I'm afraid. You're never going to ride again. Sorry. Why did you bring me here? That doctor of yours, what does he know? I'll be back, you'll see. I've been through worse. In Zimbabwe, my friends and I tried to warn people against Mugabe. Too few listened and even less acted. They acted as if denying a nightmare existed would keep their dreams alive. Danny Ntombo, school drop-out, foreigner, no choice. Wanna be a BMX pro. Failed. We were all supposed to be living different lives, Joshua. And you're not a foreigner, you're a refugee. And you don't have to be a high school drop-out. You don't have to be on the outside, looking in. You can have a home again, with books, a bed, regular meals. The only thing I ask is that we all do our bit to keep the lights on and help the wider community. So, what's it going to be? You're leaving us? You foreigner. And where do you think you're taking that backpack? It belongs to us anyway. Go back to Zimbabwe! You are right he should These guys must go back to their country! Guys, come here! - Fight. - Fight. Where are you going with my bag? This belongs to me. Hm? What's your name, son? Thapelo. Okay, Thapelo. Are you coming? You! Go back to your mother! Get out of here, you fucking immigrant. GRANDMA Son, step forward and be seen. I am Dinura, aka Vetkoek. Son of Chiqonio, from the Kikuyu tribe. The rich and famous will eat from my hands. And they will pay a pretty penny for my treats. We shall eat! We shall eat! We shall eat! I am Ambassador, son of Phumi, of the Ashanti tribe. The people who raise their hands in power as our continent rises out of the ashes. And I will rule. We shall rise! We shall rise! We shall rise! I am Sumiso, son of Sekayo, of the Shona tribe. The rusty nail that took my eye should have finished the job 'cause I was blind, but now... Now I see! Rusty! Rusty! Rusty! I am Fenu, son of Abeze. I am Shoe. I am Blade. - Strenus. - Sparky. - Mantis. - Sunshine. I am Payo. I… Am Obert Mambo, father of this tribe, son of Miriam, of the Shona tribe. Ha! I shine a light on the minds of the future. Shine a light! Shine a light! Son. Step forward and be seen. Who are you? Close your eyes. What is your name? Joshua. And where are you from? Mutare. Mutare. Open your eyes. I am Joshua, son of Hondo, of the Samenika tribe. Praise, Joshua! Joshua! Joshua! Praise, Joshua! Joshua. Joshua. Joshua. Welcome home, son. GRANDMA You'll get used to it. What's that? My grandmother brought it from Zim. What happened? All I remember is... is the smoke... and flames. The government soldier... had a plank... with a rusty nail in it. Home. What's he like? Mambo. I've got a full stomach. And friends. And a bed which gives me a great night's sleep. Which reminds me... My friend My friend My friend My friend My friend Boys! Shamwari! Guys, wake up. Wake up, wake up, wake up. Up, boys, up, boys, up, boys. Let the day begin. And who is going to help Mambo? - It's the maroon one. - Maroon one it is. Mambo! Mambo! Morning, Joshua. MUSICIANS UNITE AGAINST THE REGIME Do you think things will really change? Back home? Well, we have the best education on the continent. Thats a start. There's more than one way to fight for one's homeland. - Okay, whose do we have here? Kundiswa. - People got to love... Thomas, take this. And this one is for... Let me see... Ah, Peter Godwin. I have a contract here to supply books to the wider community. Now, it's nothing special, but it puts food in our bellies and clothes on our backs. And money in our pockets! And money in our pockets. Get these off. Let's go, boys. Hey. You have other priorities. Now. These books are old, but the knowledge inside them is older. Mathematics predates the pyramids, and some say that physics predates time. And good grammar is timeless. Some, sitting where you are, would say that they are at a disadvantage, that, uh, they don't have Internet, a computer, a tablet. But all Aristotle needed was a twig and some sand. And the only tablet Shakespeare used was a piece of slate. Now. This is one half of what we need. What is the other half? - Me. - Yes! Good. Good... Okay. So the academic year this year is halfway through. Now, you haven't studied for a very long time. One option is that I could take it slow and have you take exams next year. And the other option? We jump right in, give it our all, and you take them in a couple of months. Second option. Yes! Yes. "We will not go gently into that good night." Okay. Define these terms. Let me see what I have to work with. Iambic pentameter. "But what soft light through yonder window breaks. It is the East..." "…and Juliet is the sun!" - William Shakespeare. - Yes, of course! "Do not go gently into that good night..." Eight, nine, ten. Excuse me. Yeah? History Park. Douchebag boyfriend? Anyway, uh... - You're doing that wrong. - Yeah? Yeah, that... Whatever it is you're doing. No offense. Hm? Sorry. Let me just... Stretch and hold. Yeah? Don't overstretch. Sorry. My mom. Got to go. Hey! Hey! What are you staring at? Nothing. Okay, boys, that's enough for today. Okay? Ah! More vetkoek! I swear, you want to start shitting vetkoeks! You're so slow! You're going to be late for your own funeral, boy! Hold on. Free vetkoek for anybody who catches this verbal diarrhea. - Wait, wait, wait... - Go, boys! Thanks. - For, you know... - I couldn't let you maim yourself. Guessing you didn't just bruise your knee. Hit and run. I was on a bike and some douchebag left me for dead in the street. Also hit and run? Not quite. Surgeries. Dancing. Yes. How did you know? Oh... - You and your gang... - Troupe. You and your troupe were crossing the road, - and... - And? And it was... blocking traffic. Oh? Yeah. It was cool. How about I show you how to stretch properly? Yeah. Thanks. I'm Olivia, by the way. Joshua. I am Joshua. Son of Hondo. Of the Samenika tribe. - Whoa! Too heavy? - No - I'm good. - Okay. - Just in case. - Ah. Ah, thank you. You know that this is not a free-for-all, hey? - Hm-mm. - It's taken me a long time to develop this system. Rusty has a list. I mean, books must be delivered in accordance with that list, you understand? Absolutely. So, my young friend, go forth and make a difference! You did it! Hey, Joshua, hurry up! Hurry up. Does she get a specific book? What do you think? What do you feel like reading? That one. This is a really good one. I love it. There's this one moment, they go to... Thanks so much. Next time, none of your opinions. We're on a schedule. Lucky for you, this is our last stop. Come on. Who's the new dog biscuit? Joshua. So why do you sound like you're South African? You have to fit in, you know? They call it survival of the fittest. Well done, well done, well done. Hard work pays, boys! I'm proud of you. Hard work. - What does hard work do? It pays! - It pays! So... How was your first day? - Well done, Joshua. - Lord, thank you. Thank you! Thank you. So what's next for you? I don't want to study yet. I want to backpack across Africa first. Experience dance from the roots. I want to figure stuff out for myself. First hand. Your parents are cool with that? It took a lot of convincing. So where are you allowed to go? No war or conflict zones. I have to call or text every single day. Hush! And you'll be travelling alone? Of course. How else am I supposed to go on a solo adventure? Your father is letting you do this? Well, you made it here, by yourself. You and your Dad close? Joshua? Shit. I'm sorry. Okay. Your leg's getting so much better. Soon you won't need me. Thanks... for the juice. Pleasure. Thank you. So, let me see what you've been doing. I haven't proofread it yet... It's okay. Let's see here. Mhhhh Mambo Okay. Read your opening paragraph. "They should have taken over the castle quicker, but he was afraid of what could happen. He ought to have killed him, but the crashing bricks did the job for him... his castle made of sand tumbling into the sea with him, forever lost in the shadow of his own dillusions. Good. Good. Good, strong start. Now read the circled words. Uuh Should... could... ought... shall. All good words right? - Yeah. - We shall overcome. We ought to demand our rights. She could be the one. You should finish high school. What? What's your story, Joshua? The one you're not telling us. I guess... You guess… Let me ask you, would you rather Dr Wagner A - guessed what treatment you should have; B - guessed what treatment you ought to have; or C - I told you exactly what treatment you..." C, exactly what treatment I need. Exactly. Now read your paragraph again. Hmm He took over the castle... because he was afraid of what had happened. He crushed him with a brick. His castle made of sand crumbling into the sea with him, forever lost in the shadows of his own delusion. I get it. You're good, son. You're ready, you've got this. Bon appetit. Buy one get one free Rusty! - Howzit. My man! - I'm great. So, got our gifts today, or... Is he coming for my job? Hey, hey, hey, wake up, wake up. Where's this guy from? Oh, the man! Rusty... so good to see you. It's always a pleasure, Miss. And, who is that? That's Joshua. Joshua... nice to meet you. Come close, don't be shy. I won't bite. Let's get to know each other better. Miss Kay, you look very, very beautiful today. Is there something that we could eat? Sis, man. Sorry, Miss Kay. Now, Joshua, you know Miss Kay loves to read, hey? Why don't you give me some extra books? Yeah... Whoa, whoa, wait... Rusty... Nice, Josh. - Thanks bro - No problem - You are an idiot! - Come, let's go. Hey, you'll get used to it. Extra books? You did... what? I don't understand. What's the big deal it's just a few books. A few books? Yeah, I mean... She likes to read. Right, guys? Right? so, I thought... no! No! I do the thinking around here. Me. People rely on me to deliver these books without fuss and on time. You understand me? Yeah. Me. Not you. Joshua... If you want to know Mugabe... Never to be published. I know I've not been a very good father, Joshua. My father was a guard in... Bob's government. Never read a book in his life. They made him do it to prove his loyalty denounce my book which he couldn't even read. A book. I started delivering books as a way to raise funds for my brothers and sisters back home. I kept what I could for the... children here, but the rest I send back to the resistance. You know, you will be my eighteenth child to go through high school. And hopefully graduate university. Eighteen. We don't just deliver books here, Joshua. Here you are. JOSHUA HONDO I've got something for you. This is great, thank you! What do I owe you? Nothing. Just… get rid of the cane. You really don't like my cane? So your parents... Intellectual know-it-alls, really. Seems to have its benefits. Is Joshua your real name? Last I remember, yes. Olivia's not my real name. My real name is Lukhanyiso. That's beautiful. How'd they come up with Olivia? As a kid, we moved... five times in the first seven years of my life. Whatever it took to make an extra buck so we could... buy a place of our own to call home. When we finally bought our first place, it was the shittiest apartment, in the shittiest part of town. But I danced and screamed my head off. I live here! I live here! I live here! I live here! I live here! Lukhanyiso. Are those my shorts? Yes. I didn't know you had a pool. I didn't know you existed. Well... now you do. Hi... I'm Rene. And this is Michael. I'm Joshua Hondo. Joshua, could you do me a favour? Of course. Go put some clothes on. Olivia, you really should have checked with us first. So where does he go to school? I don't know. Seems you don't know too much about each other. Not true, we know lots. - Really? - Yeah. I have to go and find Joshua. Joshua. I'll sneak out the back. You could. But... they're going to want to get to know you at some point. So... Did it have to start with me… wearing your dad's shorts? Hey, hey... Nothing happened. No, no, nothing happened. I'm going to go get changed. You a dancer too? Dad, Joshua rode pro BMX. Oh? Well, almost pro. Almost. Joshua... flew through the air, broke bones. What did you say your name was? Joshua Hondo, sir. Well, Mr Joshua Hondo, come regale us with tales... of broken bones, and things of that nature. You're talking about a dispersed workforce that rarely - if ever - have to meet face-to-face. Dad, not everyone's interested. Poppet, have you even decided what your varsity major is yet? I'm going to get... ready. Joshua, what are your plans for the future? Don't let him spin circles around you. What? Thank you both for a lovely evening. Bye, Dad. Bye. - And Joshua... - Yes, sir? To be continued. Yes. Sorry about my dad. You don't have to apologize. He's your dad. Olivia, I heard you and your mom talk about how little you know about me. And I've been thinking... that... It feels so wrong that I know so much about you and yet... I want to know more. We must be quiet. Why? If anyone wakes up... well, it'll be your time to face the inquisition. Is this where you study? Sometimes... I help tutor the younger boys. We deliver those. It's... how we make a buck. I'm sorry. I hope I didn't upset you. Okay, okay, okay! Lukhanyiso... Come on! Come on! Come on! Woah, Woah, Woah! Okay, go! Go, go, go for the shot! Go, go, Strings, run through, run through, run through! Goal! Let's go, let's go! Play, play, play! Hey, this isn't some free-for-all. We've got work to do. Let's go. You're an asshole Joshua... Not today. You're nothing special, Joshua. Just remember that. You need the exercise. Let's go. What's wrong with you, man? Are you jealous or something? I said, let's go. So... This girl of yours. Why haven't we been introduced? Uuh I was afraid that if she saw where I lived, she wouldn't want to see me again. You are ashamed of us? No. I'm proud to call the library my home. I was scared that... she... might not be the person I'd hoped her to be. And? She still wants to see me. You should count yourself fortunate. Anyway. Enough of these bourgeois girls, hey? You have an exam to write. - We got you. - My friend You're nothing special, Joshua... special... Special... It's okay. It's okay, Joshua, it's okay. Whatever that nightmare was, don't bring it into the exam room with you. It belongs in your past. So what's next? You know I don't want to deliver books all my life. I want more. The things you take for granted. A home; family a good life. Not as charmed as it looks. I'm sorry. Sorry I was born into it. THE ZIMBABWEAN. You finished early, huh? Yeah I was taught by the best. Come. You said you knew these guys. - I do! - You said you trusted them. I trust them, I trust them. What do you mean? They're my boys! What do you mean, they're your boys? I trust them. Let's get these guys out of here. Come on, get a move on! No! Oh please, please... ...only one way. They betrayed me, Mambo. Then they also betrayed me. Go. They're fucking kids! You know what they're like, I'll deal with them. Oh, please... People rely on me. This is about respect and obedience. If you want respect, then let's walk away. Walk away? Okay. Then you better do your job... Or you will find yourself kneeling beside them. You'd better talk. Look at me. There's no one else! It was them. Wait for the train! You! You watch. Joshua. I just got back. Olivia dropped me off. We were celebrating. You know, writing the last exam. Yes, you should celebrate. It's getting late, Joshua, you should... Go to bed. Goodnight. And you know, these bourgeois girls with their bourgeois cars... They can get you into trouble. Mm? Be careful. Don't let her change you, Joshua. Don't let her change you. Hey! Rusty! Joshua! Your roll... Hi! I'm so glad you made it! Can we talk somewhere quiet? Sure. Studio. I've been thinking about... - everything that's happened. - I know. It's crazy, right? I like you a lot. Olivia, you and I... It's not going to work. Wow. - Olivia, I'm sorry, it's... - Please... it's... Leave. What am I missing? It's taken me... a really... long time... to find someone... that I actually like, not a douchebag. Olivia, it's not you. Our worlds are just too different. I never took you... to be a child, or a coward. Welcome home, Joshua. Where have you been? We were worried about you. Come and join us. I'm just teaching Strings the finer points of... Definitely not a write-off. Nor is it in the scrapyard, Mambo. And that doesn't even come close to the biggest lies... you've been telling us! In books. You keep them in books. Let's see... They're there. Good reading material, isn't it? Mm? Books! In books! So you've... graduated into the real world. Welcome, Joshua. It's coke, so what? Shamwari... You knew? Do you know where you could end up? We're a family. You're breaking it. No. No, no, no. You're all being used. By him. So... Have any of my kids been hurt? Tell me where in the world it is safe for a young, black refugee. Were your… townships – were they safe? What about the people... you killed next to the train tracks, Mambo? Who is next? Shoes? Strings? Vetkoek, Sparky? Sunshine? Me? Rusty? Who? Who scraped you off the tarmac? Mambo. Who gave you an education? Mambo. No, no... Who gave you a family? No, no... Mambo. Every father will disappoint his son at some point. It is part of being a father. A father? A father? To who? To you. To them. Grow up, Joshua. Grow up! You're not a child anymore. Grow up! Fine. I'll grow up. I'll do what needs to be done. To protect my brothers. My family. I'll call the police. The police? Stop him Mambo... Let him go! Let him go! I told you about these bougie girls. Hello? Is that the police? Joshua Joshua! Joshua, get up! Let me go! Joshua, please! Let me go! Joshua, no! No! Go! Go! Go! Shamwari. Leave me alone! Leave me alone. Shamwari! Go. Go. Okay Let's go, boys! Let's go! Let me out of the car. Please! No! No! Joshua! Slow down! - No! - Please stop the car Olivia! You okay? Can we go? Can we go? I am an English professor I am an English professor, and I will not spend another day of my life behind bars! No! No! No, we're going, we're going, I want to go. It's okay, it's okay. Lukhanyiso. It's okay. Joshua Mambo. What's the point? What's the point? There's nothing left. Nothing that matters. Nothing that matters. Nothing that matters! You matter. Mambo. You matter. You matters. I matter. The children. We matter, Mambo. We... We all matter. Joshua... I've... I've had my shot. No! The children are doing well. Staying at a new shelter. Olivia's parents… organised a fundraiser. I visit them as often as I can, I help tutor where I can. They're really doing well, actually. They're all at local schools. Vetkoek's still eating too much vetkoeks. And Rusty? Not so good. He took it badly. He moved back home. Staying with his aunt. Look, I know I shouldn't ask, but... I'll check up on you. Thank you. My father told me that every scar tells a story Line by line. No two scars are the same My story here really began when we crossed the border I left behind a different life and a different me Hey. You got this. Hm? You got this. Knowing what I do now... I know we are propelled by our choices. I know there'll be many more choices and scars to come That's the joy of the ride I am Joshua son of Hondo of the Samenika tribe
