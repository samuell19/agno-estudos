Wow! Not again. No, I really see something this time. You have to believe me. There's nothing there. It's just fire. Look again. - There's nothing there. - Hmm. Maybe you're right. All right, my loves. - Good evening, Grandma. - Good evening, Grandma. Ready for story time? Can we please read The Night Before Christmas? I think it's time for a new story. Okay, don't just stand there. Come on. The Invention of Jeronicus Jangle. Look at that! Never read us that story before. I've never read anyone this story. "Once upon a time, many, many years ago… lived the greatest inventor in all the land… Jeronicus Jangle." Children, come inside! From humble beginnings, his mind never stopped spinning. More gadgets, more gizmos! The whole town was abuzz. Oh! Where are you running to? Excited to see the most magnificent shop that ever there was… Pardon me. …Jangles and Things. Everything was alive. Even things that shouldn't be. Jeronicus was inspiring to all, none more than his most trusted apprentice, Gustafson. Prepare yourself for Gustafson's magnificent… …marvelous, eh… Bout of brilliance. The Twirly… …Whirly. Hey. It works! It really does. Just a few tweaks, that's all. He's just an apprentice, nothing more. Gustafson fancied himself a great inventor. You'll see. But that distinction had already been taken. Mr. Jangle, you've got so many inventions! Oh. For his most fantastical invention, he had been waiting for its final ingredient to arrive. And then one day… Package for Jeronicus Jangle! Oh! It is! The key to unlock his wildest dreams and change his life forever! Attention, everybody. I got something to say. I am giving it all away! Here! You can't leave empty-handed. You gotta have something! It's gonna be a merry, merry Christmas indeed! Later. Daddy, what's going on? Jessica, sweetie, it is the most wonderful day. Hey, remember that thing Daddy said he'd get you? - Which thing? - Doesn't matter. I'm gonna get you ten of 'em. Jessica, wait for your father. Mom, I have to get my smock! We're inventing! Professor Jangle, you promised you'd look at my invention. - It's getting there. - No, no, no, Professor, just two minutes? Oh, did you calibrate the gyroscopic stabilization system like we discussed? - Not yet, but... - Realign the gimbals? - No, but... - Do that. I'll look at it tomorrow. - Hey, but, Professor... - And man the shop, my boy! Brilliance beckons. Genius awaits! Yes! Finally. After all these years. I told you he'd already be up here. Where is it? Oh, there he is. The basis of… With the addition, each raised to the second power… Divided by the number "N" times 2… This is it. Something should happen… …now. Now. Now! Oh, it's working! It's working! Don't be alarmed. This is how it's supposed to happen. Yes! You gotta come see this. Come. Hmm. Whoo-hoo! Ha-ha! ¡Olé! It is I, Maestro Don Juan Diego. When the bull sees me, he slays himself. It is an honor for you to finally meet me. And I… - You? - I'm Jeronicus. - Mmm. - And this… - Oh. - This is my wonderful family. Ah! ¡Qué bella, mi reina! ¡Cuidado! ¡Cuidado! - I am fragile. - I got you. Mucho mejor. You can throw roses at my feet later. Ah. I like when people stare at me. I give them something to stare at in the form of a dance. Everything we dreamed of. - Everything I promised you… - And bow! …will be ours now. I believe in you, Jeronicus. Hello, hello? Magical toy just came to life! Focus! Focus. - I believe in you the most. - Aw. ¡Qué dulce! And I believe in you. That's why… I got you… an early Christmas gift. My own inventor goggles. They're perfect! Now you're an inventor. I am, Daddy, just like you. Aw. Okay, back to me. Oh, Professor! You did it. Ooh! Ugh! ¡Ay, Dios mío! - But how? - You are very stinky. Perfect! Por favor. Admire me from a distance. Soon, there'll be a million of 'em. Huh? A million of me? One for every child in the world. Uno, dos, tres… Uh… But, but... I am one of a kind! We have to celebrate. Let me get dinner ready. - Celebrate what? - Yes, indeed. Wait, wait. Excuse me! Wonderful family! - Gustafson, straighten up everything… - Uh-huh. …and take good care of our new friend… Sí, señor. …whose very existence has changed everything. - Let's discuss this "million" thing. - Jeronicus! I'll be right there, my love! - Eh… ¿Profesor? Yoo-hoo! - Professor J, could you... - It'll be a merry Christmas! - You promised... Wait till children everywhere see this! I am an inventor too. Clearly not a good one. Stinky? Yes. Good? No. A million of me? Calibrate the gyroscopic stabilization system. Realign the gimbals. Who could conceive such a thing? This is absurd. I am singular. I am spectacular! To pull off such a feat, he would need… "Plans for Don Juan Doll." Ah! ¡No, no, no! ¡No puedo! Hmm. Mmm. It must feel good to be such an integral part of bringing something so amazing to life. It was, um… Well, the professor's work really. I'm just his apprentice. Sí, pero… I am sure you've created something of your own almost as amazing as me. After all, you're an inventor, too. I've been telling everyone just a few tweaks is all it needs. The professor promised to look at it tomorrow. The bull waits for tomorrow! But by then, he is dead. We wait for no tomorrows. ¡Ay! Something to look at! Hmm! Ah-ha! That book of inventions can belong to us. Those are the professor's inventions. Those are your inventions. Those pages bear the sweat of your fingers. They are as much yours as they are his. But that would be stealing. Borrowing. Indefinitely. Together, we can build an empire. And the name Gustafson will shine brighter than a thousand Spanish skies. And I, Don Juan Diego, will remain one and only one of a kind. Gustafson! You didn't think we'd have a celebration without you? Answer soon, or this food will find a happy home in my belly. Gustafson! Gustafson! Gustafson! All the best, young man. Gustafson! Merry Christmas, Jangle. Gustafson! Gustafson! Jeronicus! Gustafson. Oh, no! Is he coming back? Unfortunately not. Jeronicus tried to convince the constables of what Gustafson had done, but he had no proof. And so, Jeronicus, ever the optimist, returned to what he knew best. Only, things weren't quite the same. He couldn't seem to find the right screw or turn the right gear. And year after year, the crowds grew less, the bills stacked high… …and Jeronicus watched as his stolen book of inventions turned his once loyal apprentice into the richest toy-maker in the world. But Jeronicus refused to give up. Once a great inventor, always a great inventor. But the magic, it seemed, had escaped him. And soon… Good luck, Jangle. …so would everything else. Jessica tried to fill the space left behind. But the loss was too great. And Jessica, too small. Eventually, it became clear. She hadn't lost just one parent… But two. Broken, defeated, Jeronicus insisted she'd be better off without him. And finally… She granted his wish. And Jangles and Things, once a world of wishes and wonder, was no more. And Jeronicus Jangle, the greatest inventor of all, vowed never to invent anything ever again. - The cuckoo inside just doesn't cuckoo. - Mm-hmm. It's a bit of a family heirloom. Hmm. Do you have family? I'm okay! I'm okay. I swept the shop, wiped down the counters… And mopped the floor. Did you clean the pantry? Ugh! It would mean a lot if you could fix it. Of course he can fix it. I mean, he's the greatest inventor of all. Children. Active imaginations. Thank you! Bye! Edison, time for your chores! Mom, we're inventing! This is a pawn shop. - What don't you understand about that? - No, it's not. It's a magical, mystical… Goodbye, Edison. …world of wishes and wonder! - Good morning, Ms. Johnston. - Good morning, Edison! Invent anything today? Soon! Good morning, Mrs. Johnston. Good morning, Jerry. It's so dark in here. Ah… Ah… Ah… Perfect. I kinda liked it the way it was. How's my favorite pawnbroker? Hmm? Who's not really a pawnbroker. Who wants everyone to believe he is. Hmm? Jerry? I'd be better if you used my name. You're the cutest thing. Huh? Hello, Jerry. It's Jeronicus. It's Jerry. Do you have something for me today, Mrs. Johnston? It's "Ms." I'm widowed. Remember? He's dead. Gone. Never coming back. I'm sure he's in a better place. Jerry the Jokester. You… might want to open this one. You're three months late on your gas. Actually, it's four. You overpaid the month before, so they gave you a credit. - Mrs. Johnston, I'd appreciate… - Ms. …If you stopped opening my mail. It's just a… sixth sense I have. A gift. Knowing what's inside… Without seeing it. Got it. Mrs. Johnston… I don't have time for this today. Jerry! Lighten up! You've just got to smile. I'll lay it down here. Are… are you drunk? Background dancers? Watch the door! Careful, careful, careful! It's priceless! Whoa! I suppose if times are tough enough, one will sell just about anything, Jangle. - She was just delivering my mail. - Expressing my affection. In the most respectful way I know how. Would you mind expressing it somewhere over there? Anything for you, Jerry. You know… Your cousin is visiting for the Holidays. Merry Christmas. Hopefully my favorite cousin. Nope. Mr. Delacroix. - Jangle... - Just the person I've been waiting for. Yes, which is why you haven't answered any of my inquiries. Yes, I've been thinking. Jangle, for the last 30 years, you've been promising something sensational. - Yes, and I have a thought. - Yes, something spectacular. Hmm? Silver. You melt it down. It's a 3.5, but it'll be a 4.5 next year. - Something stupendous. - It'll be 5.7 the year after that. Something that will show the bank they've made a return on their investment. Which is why I needed more time. I can show you. - We're moving... - I'm sorry. - The bank can't wait any longer. - Just take a look... - You'll see yourself. - Listen to me! Either come up with the money you've borrowed by Christmas… That's just days away. …or show me the revolutionary invention you once promised. Something revolutionary? Take the circumference of spectacular. Divided by the second derivative of sensational… It'll take approximately… Two thousand years. It's a big miscalibration on my part. - The invention or the bank will seize… - Wait, wait. - …Jangles and Things and all its assets. - Mr. Delacroix! Mr. Delacroix! I would lose everything. I'm sorry to say it, old friend, but it looks like you already have. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas… Something revolutionary… Something revolutionary. He had found the one thing that could change everything. Here you are. But still something was missing. Someone was missing. Many times he sat to write… But Jeronicus couldn't figure out the words. I suppose "I'm sorry" hadn't quite been invented yet. And though she had moved far away, the heart, it seems, isn't bothered by distance, only by what it loves and wishes loved it in return. And Jessica grew weary of the wait. She had a life of her own now, and a daughter. A peculiar little girl. Curious. Magical, even, some might say. Journey. Her mother had promised that one day they'd visit Jangles and Things, but if, and only if, they were invited. Journey! Then one day… She was. It's only a couple of days, so remember to mind your manners, and eat your dinner. All of it. No matter how it tastes. Be kind to your grandfather. Even if he isn't… Everything you've imagined he'll be. He'll be more. I just know it. All aboard! I love you, Mom! - Love you more. - Wait! Wait up! I'm coming! She couldn't wait. Living up to her name, a most magical journey was about to begin. Giddyap! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Excuse me, do you know where can I find Jeronicus Jangle? - He's right over there. - Thank you. - I'll take this one. - Twenty pegs. Are you Mr. Jangle? Depends on who's asking. I'm Journey, your granddaughter. My granddaughter's name is Jackie. Something with a "U." Justice? Jupiter? June? July? It's Journey. That's a J-O-U. That's with a U. Okay. My mom told me to give this to you. "Illumination ignites the integration. N times between…" I see. "Dear Father…" Allegedly. Uh, I'd like, uh, one egg, please. "I've decided to let Journey stay with you until Christmas." Journey. Interesting name. "She's an inquisitive girl, but well-mannered." "Like you said, it's time you both got to know each other." Did I say that? When did I say that? "I'll be there to pick her up on Christmas morning." "I hope you are well. Love, Jessica." No. My real granddaughter would never wanna visit me anyway. But I have nowhere to stay. Speak quieter, I'm having a hard time hearing you. I have nowhere to stay... You can't stay here. Not now. Maybe next year, or year after. Maybe five or ten years from now. You know what they say about children? They're a creative vacuum. I can't have that right now. I'm workin' on something. - But... - Goodbye. Symmetry… Brings synchronicity. I… I don't have time for this. Didn't you understand when we talked outside? She wanted her own pair of inventor goggles. "I want a purple band, Daddy." "They have to have a purple band." That's what I did. Her mother thought she wasn't ready for it, but… I knew that she was. You can stay. Great. After you sign this. All clauses of confidentiality to protect the specialty of the personality whose mentality transcends the continuum between fantasy and reality. Which means… You don't touch, move, bust, break, you don't take anything from this shop. You understand? Okay, sign it right here. The pen is out of ink. Keep going. The pen is full of ink. Signed the contract. You signed it. You're under contract. What's this? That's none of your business. That's exactly… It's… none of your business. Okay? You hungry? I have one egg. We could split it. Take your bag down the hall. First bedroom on the left. Okay. What's goin' on? Is it all right if I call you Grandpa Jeronicus? Could you not? I guess you're right. Grandpa J sounds so much better. Hey. Hey, hey, hey! Okay! Okay. See you soon, Grandpa J! Well, you hurry back as slowly as you can. Why won't anyone call me by my name? Jeronicus wasn't the only one in need of something revolutionary. Gustafson, too, was searching. Who's Gustafson? He's the one who stole Jeronicus's book of inventions. Aren't you even listening? Driven by Don Juan's greed and thirst for power, Gustafson's empire soared. For nearly 30 Christmases, Gustafson unveiled one stolen invention after the other. But then, there were no more. So Gustafson had no choice but to revisit an idea of his own. After all, he was an inventor, too. Gustafson! All right, I'm taking orders now. You want 100? I can tell. I can see that on your face. Oh, my gosh! Wait! Five thousand! Another five as well. Wait! They're comin' at me! It's overwhelming! Oh, hey! Give one to your momma and tell her to call me! Yeah! Hey, ha! Hey, ha! It's frying my face! - Get a physician! - Somebody help! We've got to get out of here! I fixed the center wheel six times on these things. That's stupid, stupid, stupid. I'm stupid. I'm dumb. Okay, the gyroscopic stabilizer's supposed to… I'm not reading this right. Stabilize the gyroscope… Well, maybe next time someone will lose an eye. So they'll never have to see what a mockery you've become. If you hadn't forced me to burn your designs, I could have mass produced you. And the burden of building an empire would have fallen upon whom? I am, and forever will remain, one and only one of a kind. I will fix it. You'll see. Or I will come up with something even better. You wanna know why? Because I'm the Toy Maker of the Year, Toy Maker of the Year, Toy Maker… …Toy Maker of the Year! Lift me! Do not be afraid. I want to offer… …sweet words of encouragement. I encourage you to not be an imbecile! Your only successes have come from that book of inventions. So why not borrow another one of Jeronicus's inventions? - Because I have already stolen… - Borrowed. …everything in that book. There is nothing left of him. There is nothing left in that pawn shop of his. Do I need to slap you again? Because I'm happy to do it, huh? Truly. Once a great inventor, always a great inventor. There is always something left. - So what are you working on? - Couldn't be someone talking, the only person talking couldn't, because they're so busy doing their chores. - But Grandpa, I don't want to... - Talking. - I was just trying to say... - Chores. Hmm. You have to raise the variable exponentially to the second power. The other one. No, that's not possib... Square root. Derivative would be… You understand this? What about…? This one? The circumference of spectacular. And this? This one? The second derivative of sensational. You looked through my notes. Hey, hey, hey, watch. Wait till I'm finished. You're not gonna trick me on this one. What about this? That's what I thought. It's okay. Well, it would be the square root of possible, but there's a miscalculation. The square root of possible is the summation from one to infinity… Multiplied by the integer from zero to possible… Delta-T times the log of circumference, times one minus theta raised… Derivative of… Divided by sin-theta. From zero to one. Multiplied by the derivative of theta divided by the interval from one to zero… Now it should work. You can see that? Can't you? No. Not anymore. - I was just... - No more talking. - Just chores. - But, Grandpa… Chores. Chores. Mom? Whoa! Whoa! "The Jangleator 2000"? I knew it! Ah! Ghost! - Who are you? - Who are you? I'm Journey. Jeronicus's granddaughter. I'm Edison. Edison Latimer. Professor Jangle's most trusted assistant. You wanna be my apprentice? Do you wanna be mine? I asked first. As the head inventor, I insist we leave at once. - Not until I find what I'm looking for. - What are you looking for? I'll know it when I see it. You shouldn't be touching anything in here, it could do something like... …that. There is something here. Why didn't the professor tell me? It's… it's amazing! It'll be even more amazing when I get it to work. If the professor couldn't get it to work, what makes you think you can? Because there's nothing that says I can't. What does that even mean? Wait. There's something's wrong with it. There'd be something wrong with you if you were stuck in a dark room all your life. It looks like the power source is in a superposition of states. We just need something to collapse the wave function. Will it work or not? Yes. What are you saying yes to? Will it work or not? It's a simple question. All I request a simple answer. It will work. At least, I believe it will. It will work. At least, I believe it will. I don't want to die! I haven't even hit puberty! Puberty! Come on. Edison, let go! Edison, let go! If anything goes wrong, I'm right here. - It's okay. - It's okay. Come on. Whoa! Whoa, it's okay. [birds chirping| Easy. Be careful. My name is Journey. I'm Buddy. Buddy 3000. And this is Edison. Ow! I'm okay. Ow! I'm okay. Hi! Hi! Edison. Hi! Why didn't you work for my grandfather? I've always worked. Just needed someone to believe. That's it. That's it. Belief! It collapsed the wave function. It must have been part of Grandpa J's formula. It works. Because we believe. Of course we believe. He's hovering above your head. He's hovering above your head! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Be careful. Belief, belief, belief. What the…? I'm actually flying! - Buddy. - Actually flying! Whoa! What's happening? How is this possible? Edison, just let go! Let go! - It'll be all right! - It's not gonna be all right! - Whoa! - Whoa! Bingo! Who's there in my workshop? Less belief! What are you doing up here? What have you done? I told her not to touch it, but she's not a very good listener. The contract clearly stated you were not to touch, move, bust, break or take anything from this shop! - Do you remember? - I didn't move it. You expect me to believe it got up and walked over here? Well, actually, he flew. That's not possible. Watch. I'll show you. Like this. You see? You see? I told you. It doesn't work. He does. You just have to believe. Professor, you really are the greatest inventor of all. I'm not an inventor. And you're not an inventor either. But, Grandpa... Enough already, okay? Enough. Nothing would make me happier than if this worked. He does. You have to believe me. I'm telling you the truth. I would not lie to you, Grandpa. - I need you… - Please! - I need you… to go to bed. - I don't want to go to bed. I want to stay up here and fix this, please! - Please! - Good night. - All you have to do... - Listen to me! Go! Hello, young lady. Hmm. Right, yeah. Oh! Oh. Pardon my rudeness. - I'm Gustafson. - Gustafson. Oh. Yeah. Well done. And… You must be Jeronicus Jangle's granddaughter. If I know anything about your grandfather, Jangles and Things is stirring with something sensational. Something… spectacular. It's just a pawn shop. You and I… Both know there's something in there. You can tell me. Perhaps I could market it. Or mass produce it. For him. I've got items to mark down. In the pawn shop. Last day before Christmas! Get your perfect presents for your perfect people! Did you hear? The Professor's franchising! Edison, he's not franchising. He's closing the shop. - Journey! - But not if I can help it. The day won't last forever. Much to be done. Sorry if I yelled at you. - You shouldn't be some places. - It really works! ¡Olé! - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! - Mrs. Johnston? - He's getting so big. Give the little ones a squeeze from me. Mrs. Johnston. I've been looking for you all day. You always come by the shop. Something wrong? Is everything all right? Jerry! What a surprise! What's the problem? Are you all right? - Yes! Yes! - Mrs. Johnston? It's new. Do you like it? Nice truck. This isn't… Oh. How did that get there? Mrs. Johnston, I don't… I don't have time for this. I just need you to collect my boxes. I know. I know! You have boxes that need collecting. Everyone in Cobbleton has boxes that need collecting! Only they've all gone for the holidays to be with their families and… loved ones. Um… Focus. Mrs. Johnston, focus. You know, Jerry. Listen. A little fun wouldn't kill you! Trying to spread joy. It's Christmas after all. - Need a little help with that? - I've got it. I… I think you have to push the latch. Come on. Good job. Mrs. Johnston? It's just that I need this taken care of today. - Happy holidays, Jerry. - I'm going out of business, Mrs. Johnston. - It's supposed to start snowing. - I'm closing the shop in a few days. - How about a time? - I hear your granddaughter's down. Oh! Grandchildren are like children, only you can give them back. Could you give me a time of day? - Just… No. - I'll just... It's fine, Jerry. I've got it. - There we go. - Thank you, Jerry. - You'll come by, though, right? - Here we go. Of course, Jerry! And off we go! Get out the way! - Here we go! Bye! - Mrs. Johnston! I have to be out by Christmas. That's tomorrow! - Oh, Jerry. - Jeronicus! My name is Jeronicus! It's Jerry! Why won't anybody call me by... Hey! Okay. Okay, whoever that is, you're in for it. Journey? - Oh! - Got ya! You asked for it. Okay. I was a kid once, too. You missed me! Oh! Somebody got hit with a snowball. Equation from one to infinity. With a… I need some help! Boys! - Can we play with you? - Sure. Come on. Let's get 'em. - Let's make snowballs. - Yes! Yes! Told you I was gonna get you! Grandpa J, this is so much fun! You missed me! You know what? Edison! Of course. He's probably out there somewhere having fun. Much packing to do, much time to be made up. See to it that these boxes are filled. - But Grandpa, I don't want to be... - Packing. - Boxes! - Grandpa... Grandpa! Try to find the synchronicity between the two. What happened? Gustafson started bragging that he was the greatest inventor, - and the professor hadn't... - Edison, tell me you didn't. I'm the worst apprentice ever. I mean, you're a bad apprentice, but not even close to how bad I am. - Buddy! - Ow! I'm okay. Where's Buddy? I think I hear my mother calling me. Did you hear that? I did. - Here I come! - Edison! Huh? - We have to get Buddy back. - Yes. You absolutely do. I'm still working. You thinking what I'm thinking? If I say no, will you stop thinking it? That's a lovely truck. It's new! I'm still getting used to it. I almost only killed one person today. Progress! Journey would stop at nothing to rescue Buddy, her only hope of saving Jangles and Things, and her grandfather as well. We can't go through there! Whether you think you can or think you can't, you're right. What does that even mean? The buyers are here? Again? Did you not learn your lesson from the last time? We saw it with our very own eyes. It's foolproof. Ah! You are proof that there are fools. Fools, fools, fools, fools… Fools. Journey? Edison? Didn't I tell you not to play in my shop? What have you done? I now present to you the premier proprietor of playtime products, and 28-time Toy Maker of the Year. Excuse me. Sir, have you seen my granddaughter? Come on! A man whose artistic excellence is unparalleled. She's wearing… the cogs and screws in her hair. Whose brilliance defies all logic and explanation. You get to like her once you know her. I'm getting there. I'm getting there. The marvelous… I'm there. …miraculous, master of magnificence… The greatest inventor in all the land… Gustafson! You're too kind. An interactive robot. What child could resist? My latest… My greatest… The Buddy 3000! And shaboom. We are simply waiting for it to warm up. I was working on the housing last night, and, um… Hello? Now… Oh, no, don't miss it. 'Cause you don't wanna miss it. This is going to be amazing. The wow factor alone will knock your socks off. Mrs. Johnston! - Jerry! - Can you take me to Gustafson's factory? I could be persuaded, I'm sure. No bother. I'll just walk. Oh, Jerry! Lighten up. Hop inside. It's Jeronicus. My name… is Jeronicus. When you're walking, it's Jeronicus. When you're riding with me, it's Jerry! - Might've be tight. I've used tin cogs… - They don't believe. …Instead of copper cogs. It makes the product more light, which is easier for transportation when you bring it into your homes for your children, during this holiday season. Twenty-eight-time Toy Maker of the Year. Box this wretched thing up and send it where we send all ill-conceived toys. To retail, sir? No, to the crusher. The crusher? Yes! The crusher! There he is. I'll distract the guards and you go get Buddy. Well, this one's next. Hey! Who are you? Back here! Come on, Buddy. - Me again! - Why are you back here? Well, you see, I, uh… I forgot to deliver these, didn't I? Oh! Silly me. You know what it's like, being Christmas and everything. All these things go back and forth. Parcels, gifts, letters, you name it. The guards! They're right behind me! Come on! We have to get back to the tunnel! You're doing great, Edison! You're lying! Your hair, as shiny as a stallion's mane. Your eyes, the azul of the sea. And your bumpies, with the burn of a fresh-picked habanero that's just about to... Do not finish that sentence, please. There are kids in the factory. They've taken the crate with the robot. Who cares? It's a failed invention. Let 'em have it. Hijo de la… If it were failed, then why would they be trying to recover it? They wouldn't! Kids in the factory! Stop them at once! Kick their shins. Pull their hair. Twist their arms! Stop them at once! Hurry. Oh no! - What happened? - It's broken. Is that the fan? - Edison? - Professor? Grandpa J! Journey, are you all right? - Yes! - No! - Yes! - No! We're fine! We've got Buddy. We have to get him out of here. Okay. I want you to turn back right now. Right now! At once! I'll meet you at the gate. Fire! Fire! Grandpa J, there's a fire! We have to go through the blades! Journey, listen to me! You cannot go through the blades! It's impossible! That's impossible! That's it! The square root of possible! That's it! - The square root of possible! - It's just a theory! A formula in my mind! - It's not been tested! - We trust you! We don't have a choice! It's a theory! We have tracked the intruders to a fire in the east tower. We have tracked the intruders to a fire in the east tower. - Kick it in! - Yes, sir. Grandpa J, just believe! Okay. Stay there. Stay there. Okay. Velocity. Centrifugal force. Point of inertia. Hurry! Okay, 45 seconds. No! Wait a minute. 1,500 feet. Okay. The blades are movin' at 500 revolutions per hectosecond! You have to get caught in a current of the blades, which'll sync with the speed of the crate in the path of inertia. You have to enter at a 35-degree angle at exactly 1,500 feet per minute! You will make it through! Okay, Grandpa J, I love you! I love you, too, Journey! Let's go! Edison, we don't have time for this. There's a fire. Come on! Let's go! Just for the record, this is not a good idea! This is so cool! This is not cool! This is ill-advised! Duck! That was close. Watch out! It's getting close! Whoa! This is crazy! Edison, you just have to believe! There's no logical reason I should… …but I do! I do! You have to slow us down! We can't slow down! Slow down! - Buddy! - How does he do that? You're going too fast! 35 degrees! Buddy! No! Are you all right, Edison? - Are you okay? - I'm okay. Journey! Edison! - Are you all right? Are you okay? - Grandpa J! Grandpa J, your formula, it works. Professor! I came up with a steering mechanism made out of rope that got us through the tunnel alive. Well done, Edison. Quite the inventor. Just like you. Well, if hugs are going for free… I wouldn't say no. Mrs. Johnston? You came back! A good postal woman always ensures a safe delivery. Children, Jerry, come on! I'll get the truck, you get the crate! Open the gates! Mrs. Johnston? I really need you to keep to the left of the road! Left is good. Right is bad. "It's a failed invention." "Let them have it." Get outta the way! If you value life, get out of the way! We're here. You can stop now. Great job. - Here we go. - Yes. Careful. - Watch your step. One more. - Okay. - Thank you, Jerry. Okay. - Here we go. Edison, it's time to come home! Edison, come on, we're about to put Buddy together. My mom is calling me, so… I've got to go. Thanks for helping me rescue Buddy. I couldn't have done it without you. We both know that's not the case, but… Thanks for saying it anyway. Journey, I really, really do like you… a lot. Bye! Ow! I'm okay! Buddy. Thank you. I don't know why you came back. Because you're a good man. Stubborn. Ornery. Could benefit from a good haircut, a new set of clothes, but… Still good. Jeronicus… I know about losing things. But the magic isn't just in what you've lost. It's in what you still have. Mrs. Johnston? Ms. Johnston… Oh. Look what I found here. I forget how you use these. It's been so long. I think you… Place it over someone's head. Like so. And lean in for a kiss. Like so. Uh… Ms. Johnston? Ms. Johnston, can you hear me? - Meow. - Okay. I… I'll keep the mistletoe. They really are a group. Grandpa, you have to fix Buddy. You have to make him work again. Please. I can't. Yes, you can. You're the greatest inventor of all. You can do anything. It's why I came here. I had to see it for myself. You're here because your mother wanted you here. That's what she wrote in her letter. Because I wrote her one from you saying the same thing. Why would you do such a thing? All she ever talked about was how magical this place was, and that you could see things that nobody else could. Like I can. Everywhere I've ever been, I felt out of place. This is the only place where I've ever been where I finally felt like I belong. Journey… A child with an imagination… Always belongs. Never be afraid when people can't see what you see. Only be afraid… if you no longer see it. Okay? I love you, Grandpa J. Daddy… Jessica? I thought I'd come to pick Journey up early. I hope she hasn't been too much of a bother. It was nice of you to even wanna spend time with her at all. Actually, I never... Never could have imagined she'd be such a delight. And… and she's quite the inventor. She must have gotten that from you. Or you. We should leave now, if we're to make it by morning. Jessica, I'm sorry. For what? For giving up? For making me feel it was my fault that things turned out the way they did? Do you know how many times I went to my mailbox hoping for something… To let me know that you still cared? That you even thought about me at all? I thought about you… Every day. Every day. Given everything that happened, I wasn't sure you wanted to hear from me. So, I didn't send these letters. "I wanted you to have the world." "Reach into the heavens, pull down the stars just so they could shine on you." "Not just read about a happily ever after, I wanted to be the one to give it to you, Jeronicus Jangle, the greatest inventor of all, only wishes he were…" "The greatest father of all." Journey reminds me so much of you… And your mother. I wanna be there for her like I should have been there for you. I mean… Maybe… Smile. I'm sorry. I love you so much. I love you, too, Daddy. I'm gonna… I'm gonna go wake up Journey, if you don't mind. Say our so longs and goodbyes. If she's asleep, we could stay. Or maybe take… take a morning train. Or… Maybe we could spend Christmas here? If it's all right with you. That will be... It'll be all right with me. Is that…? Wow! - The Buddy 3000. - It's really him. What's left of him. I was hoping to put it back together for Journey. She's taken quite a liking to him. If we start now, maybe… Maybe we could put it together by morning. Symmetry and synchronicity. Which is the stability of it all. - You've been reading my notes. - I think you've been reading my notes. I have. So good to have you back. I'm gonna need something… Thanks, Dad. Make sure to open the heart. I forgot about that. - Got it? - Got it. Hey! Grandpa J, I… Mommy. Grandpa J, you did it! - Had a little help. - Mommy… Hello, baby. Had a lot of help. From both of ya. Now, all we have to do is turn Buddy on. Okay. I believe. Come on. Come on, Buddy. I… believe. Believe! Just needed someone to believe. Buddy? Jeronicus! You're alive. Alive. Yes! Good to see you, Buddy. I'm glad you're here. Glad to be here. Jeronicus Jangle! Gustafson? Well, hello, young lady. - What is the meaning of this? - Please! The robot that you stole from me. To the dungeon with him! - Yes, you. - I demand that you arrest him at once. - Right now. - For what? You're the real thief. A thief couldn't have these. The designs for the robot that I slaved over. Restless days and sleepless nights. I wanted to give up so many times, but I didn't. - I… - We. …persevered knowing that one day, - I… - We. …would realize my dream. Proof in black and white. And blue. ¿Azul? "Property of Jeronicus Jangle." Explain this at once. I don't… I… - It's an easy explanation... - I can explain. After I ran into Mr. Gustafson, I was afraid he would try to steal The Buddy 3000, so I marked the design. For proof. Uh-oh. Just arrest Mr. Jangle. You told me those were your inventions. Did you lie? Are you a thief? Yes, you. Jeronicus, save me! I'll take the matador. He's my invention after all. I am home! - What? - Mi rey… I've missed you! I like your hair. Did you do that yourself? Finally… - Children everywhere will love you. - I am extremely lovable. Puppy-dog eyes. Baby kitten eyes. - After I reprogram you. - Reprogram? Reprogram what? I am and forever will remain one and only one of a kind! We've got the wrong guy. Come on. Why are you here, sir? This doesn't make sense. You will take the word of a ten-year-old child? I'm a respected member of the community! Are you kidding? Look at that child! She has evil in her eyes! Don't you see? How did you get on the force? - You know... - Wait. I have something for him. - I had it for you that night. - What? But then you were gone. A gyroscopic stabilizer. For your Twirly Whirly. I would have shown you everything… If only you'd waited. I… Come on. Move. Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. Mr. Delacroix. Merry Christmas, old friend. Ladies. I'm sorry it's come to this. What? What in heavens…? It's something sensational. - Yes! - It's something spectacular! More than that! Something revolutionary! - It's The Buddy 3000. - The Bud… The what? - It's a robot. - Beg your pardon? A flying robot. - Is such a thing possible? - Hmm. Something sensational. Something spectacular. Something revolutionary! It talks? It talks. It talks. You talk. I do. By Jove, Jeronicus, you've done it. You are a genius, old friend. - I wouldn't say that. - Oh, no, no. - If I know anything… - Some people call me brilliant. …there's more where that came from. - I have 30 years of notes. - Then I have no doubt! Oh, look at you! I'm going to bally well kiss you. - We're kissing now. - From now on, whatever you need, the bank will give. - For the rest of your life. - Okay! - He's a genius! Spectacular! - Genius. It's a merry, merry Christmas indeed! Go in, go in! See for yourself! A merry, merry Christmas indeed! What's happening? Buddy? Put me down. Let go! Whoa! Grandpa J, just let go. Let go of what? Oh! You're flying! I said the same thing! Follow me, Buddy. Come on. - Hey, everyone! - Hello! Jangles and Things is open for business. The world of wishes and wonder. Jerry! Oh! You get down from there this instant! Hey, Edison! Up, up, and away! And everything that was stolen from Jeronicus was returned to him. And they laughed and sang, and danced, just like those flames. Keep looking. See them now? You can see them, too? You didn't think you were the only girl who could see things, did you? You're Journey. Yes. So Jeronicus Jangle is - our great-great... - Great-great-grandfather. Yes. Yes? Yes. Why didn't you tell us before? Well, I had to wait for the right moment, when you needed it the most. When you… …were ready for the magic. Because it's been ready for you. I'm okay. - Hello, Buddy. - Whoa! Hi, Journey. - Hello, Buddy! - Hi! Oh my gosh! Whoa! - Look at that! - It's so beautiful! Whoa! Is that Jeronicus's factory now? Yes, it is. I think it's time you paid a visit. Let's go! Whoa! - Not so far away. - I'm flying! - Grandma! - Look at your brother. Child, stay with us. If you believe, it's all possible.
