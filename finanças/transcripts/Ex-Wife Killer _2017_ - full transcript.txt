Well, that depends on who they're for. A pink rose is a sign of gratitude. 'It's a perfect way of telling someone' maybe your mom, that you're thinking about her. Oh, no, they're not for my mom. - They're for... - A girl? - Yeah. - Okay, go with red. 'Nothing says "I love you"' 'like a dozen red roses.' The thing is, she's not exactly my girlfriend, so.. ...saying "I love you" might be a little too much. There's always yellow. I mean, technically, it's a sign of friendship, but.. ...who gives their friends roses? Yeah, that sounds good. She'll get the point. Okay, good. - Brady, a dozen yellow, please. - I'm on it. Alright, so, that will be 49.99 plus... - Oh. - Oh? I only have 20. Brady, hold up on that dozen. I'll tell you what. I will give you one red rose on the house under one condition. You promise me that you'll tell her how you really feel. - Really? - Really. I promise. Okay. Bye-bye. And good luck. Close any mansions today? Jo, there is only one rule on Wine Wednesday. - 'Don't talk about work.' - 'Exactly.' But, if we must I will say that the market is very hot right now and your girl is killing it. Wow, look at you. Business is good for me too. But if there was ever a time that I would expand it would be now. Okay. Enough about work. We have far more interesting topics to discuss. - Like what? - Friday night. What about it? Do you have plans? Well, for a florist, Friday is not about fun. It's about work. Right. Whatever you need to tell yourself. Anyway, me, on the other hand.. My night will be filled with.. ...budding romance and passion. - Whoa! - Ha-ha. Who's the lucky guy? Brady. - Like, my Brady? - Mm-hm. - From work Brady? - Mm-hm. No. You're gonna ask him out? Not yet, but I will. Whoa! Wish I had thought of that. - He's too cute to ask out. - 'He's so cute.' Hello? Is anybody there? Laura? Is anybody there? Laura? Is that you? Laura? You'll never guess who just called me. - Was it Hannah? - How'd you know? - I have my sources. - Mm. She just asked me on a date. As friends. That sounds interesting. - Are you gonna say yes? - I think I just did. - You don't sound very excited. - Yeah, well.. There's something I've been meaning to tell you. - 'Hi.' - Hey, there. Michael, what are you doing here? Oh, you know, I was in the neighborhood and I figured I'd stop by my favorite flower shop. And I really like what you've done with the place, Josie. Still got this old thing, huh? What are you doing here? Told you, I was in the neighborhood and it occurred to me I needed some flowers. You really expect me to believe that? Okay. I guess there was one other minor reason, but.. ...it's not something I can just come out and say. I don't think it would be appropriate. Well, what is it? You're making me nervous. No, it's not that, it's just.. - I was thinking dinner. - Huh? We can discuss the matter over a well-cooked meal. How does tomorrow look for you? - Yeah, that's not gonna happen. - 'Alright.' How about Saturday? - You're missing the point. - 'Oh, okay.' Dinner's too much. How about we pencil in.. No, you cannot just waltz in here out of the blue. I haven't seen you in years. Okay. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have just shown up like this, but.. ...if I had called first you would've said no. Truth is.. ...there is something we need to discuss. - 'It's important.' - It better be. - 'Isn't it nice?' - No, it's not. Your ex-husband randomly appears and asks you to dinner. He obviously wants to rekindle an old... Are you okay? I'm sorry, I thought that you were suggesting... That he's maybe interested? - Ugh, Hannah.. - What? - Just gross. - 'Why is that gross?' Because, first of all, he's married. And second of all, it's Michael. Whom you haven't spoken to in three years. You don't know if he's still married. More importantly, if he's even the same Michael. I appreciate your optimism, but.. But? But people don't change like that. I mean, especially men. Women, too, but... especially men. Come on. Well, I mean, you can get a promotion or start meditating. Maybe shave a few strokes off your golf game but who you are deep down inside, that doesn't change. It's just how they are. Anyway, I'm going to find out tomorrow morning. I agreed to meet him for breakfast. Hm. So tell me, how've you been? - Oh, you know. - Actually, no, I don't. Listen, Michael, can we just skip the pleasantries? I was up all night trying to conjure up why you're here and I can't think of one. Same old Josie, always worrying about something. And the same old Mike, completely oblivious. There's some baggage. I get it. But honestly, I'm not here as your ex. I'm here as your business partner. - Silent business partner. - And I've been good about that. But at this point, as your partner I feel like I have a responsibility to come forward. 'Is something wrong?' No. Actually, quite the opposite. The business is healthy. Reallyhealthy. Well, yeah. We do alright. Come on, give yourself more credit than that. You do more than alright. Well, yeah, the flowers are beautiful I'll take credit for that, but we're not making millions. Not yet. So that's why you're here? We've hit a ceiling. It's time to break through. Do you not want to expand? - No, I do. Badly... - But? Are you just gonna pretend that we weren't married? I mean, how does your wife feel about us working together? Something wrong? No. Um... Laura and I are, uh, we're not together. Oh, my God. You got a divorce. We're separated. She's been acting strange lately. Look... there is no reason Josie's can't be a national brand. So, let's put the past behind us. Consider your future. Oh! Ow! - You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. This one's on me. Thank you, Jack. Is it that obvious? No, not really. Just have a sixth sense for when someone needs another cocktail. Mm. Yeah, well, I've spent a long few weeks. Relationship issues? How'd you know? Well, someone like you, alone.. It's not just that, it's.. ...my business partner, he.. ...he died. I'm sorry to hear that. May I ask how? He was murdered. The police think it's bad luck. But our office was broken into several times before. It was midnight, so, whoever it was wasn't expecting Dennis. Oh, that's crazy. Again, I'm, I'm sorry. Thank you. Where's your boyfriend? Husband. Where is he tonight? It's complicated. You want my advice? Sure, why not? Let him go. He's obviously not very wise, you're here all alone. Honey, you are so sweet. But you have absolutely no idea. Educate me. After four years of marriage all the memories, good and bad.. ...there is no such thing as letting go. Sorry to hear that. But you look at the silver lining. If you leave him, you get half. What's that? Honey... why would I settle for half when I could have it all? Okay. Hey. I thought you had a date. I don't wanna talk about it. 'So, how was your meeting with Michael?' He wants to expand Josie's. Maybe open up some locations, maybe some other stuff. That's amazing. Well, I'm going in on Monday morning and I'm turning down his offer. Why? Because it's weird. He's my ex-husband. You've been dying to expand. Okay, what happened between you two? Was it really that bad? No, it wasn't that bad. I mean, you know, it was good for a while but... he just cared about his career and we fought all the time, and there was tension and we didn't wanna be around each other. Just drifted apart. Okay, I can see how that would take its toll on a marriage. But isn't that like the best possible business relationship? I don't know, there's no guarantee that it would work. Michael seems to think that it would. What does he know? Just because he's obsessed with work doesn't mean he's any good at it. You never know, he may be like a.. ...genius entrepreneur now. Yeah, I'll believe it when I see it. Yeah. There was just someone in the backyard. What? 'Oh!' Hey, uh, I'm looking for Michael. Uh, is this not his office? I'm sorry, I don't know a Michael. Michael Robertson, I think this.. He used to work here. Oh, Mr. Robertson. He doesn't work here anymore. Well, not in this office. Well, can you tell me where I could find him? Oh, he's on the top floor. Thanks. Well, I don't care what John says. You go back to him, and you tell him MPG's quarterly earnings don't even compare to.. I'll, uh, I'll call you back. Jo, wasn't expecting you. - Is this your office? - Yeah. 'Ooh!' 'It is incredible.' Last time I knew it, you were an analyst. - And now, you're.. - CEO. You're kidding. Three years can be a long time. Yeah, but not that long. Come on, Michael, that's incredible. So, what's up? I came to talk about your proposal. Listen, I appreciate everything... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, hold on. Here, have a seat. Before you say anything let me just ask you one question. You know that painting in your office, of the vineyard? Sure, what about it? When I first met you it was already hanging above your bed. Yeah, I've had it forever. My grandmother painted it for me when I was a kid. Yeah, and living on a vineyard has been your dream ever since. We used to talk about that, every day.. ...back when that dream couldn't have been further away. So my question for you is.. ...is that still your dream? - Yeah, of course. - Then listen to me, Jo. If you trust me on this, that dream, the vineyard.. ...it will become a reality. I promise you that. So, what's it gonna be? Yes or no? Yes. Fantastic! But... under two conditions. Whatever you say. Number one.. ...I retain full decision-making power. - Naturally. - And two. This relationship is exclusively business and nothing more, okay? And that's non-negotiable. I'll have the lawyers draw up a contract and we'll be ready for your signature in the morning. ♪ I couldn't wrap my eyes ♪ Even with my fingers ♪ I won't recognize.. ♪ - Get you a drink? - He won't be here long. Okay. Well? She owns a flower shop in the valley. 'Mm-hmm.' 'And here's a shot of her' 'leaving Michael's office.' What's that? It could be a business thing or, like, maybe it could be, um.. 'Business?' Does this look like a business thing to you? - Uh, well.. - Is this all you have? Yeah. I tried to take more. But.. Uh, she, she picked up on me. You're not very good at your job, are you? Okay, you know what? Let me see this. Oh, this is great, mm. What am I supposed to do with this, hm? 'What am I supposed to do with a picture' of Josie and her friend drinking wine? You know what? Just leave. You wanted evidence of infidelity for your settlement... Now! Jack, can I have another drink, please? Yeah. Heard you had quite the night last night. Yeah, Hannah's great, it was fun. Not that fun. God, she tells you everything, doesn't she? Look, I like Hannah, just not like that. I understand. You don't have to explain. She can be a little aggressive, I know. - But she's an amazing person. - I hear you. - I'm just saying that... - Josie. Look, Hannah's a great person, I get that. That's not the reason I didn't kiss her. What I'm trying to tell you is you're the reason I didn't kiss her. What do you mean? I mean I like you, Josie. I have feelings for you, not for Hannah. - Oh! - Think about it. I know what you're gonna order for dinner before you do. I know what music you play when you're in a bad mood. Nobody knows you as well as I do. - Okay, Brady... - Tell me I'm wrong. Wh-what about Hannah? I mean, she likes you too. She's a good friend of mine. I didn't ask Hannah to like me. - No, that doesn't matter. - Sure it does. I've been holding onto this for a long time. And she likes me for, what, all of a week? - And now, it doesn't count? - No, that's not the point. You know, I can't betray her a-and we work together, that's complicated. H-hi, uh, what can I help you with today? You'll never guess what happened to me last night. What's that? I was leaving work, and out of nowhere a car started following me. Are you it wasn't just goin' the same direction? No, it was stalking me. Like, the lights were off. And then, I had to run away to lose them. - My God! Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. It's just weird, you know? Just the minute that you come back into my life, this all started. I know it's weird. I-I'm sure it's just a coincidence. What would someone want with us? Think I should call the police? I mean, sure, if, if it'll make you feel better. Okay, so, sign here, here.. ...and here. It's official. Okay, so first things first. We'll sit down this week and we'll hash out a business plan. Okay. And then on Thursday morning, I scheduled a pitch with a high-priority investor named John Miller. Thursday? We gotta will this thing into existence. No one said it was gonna be easy. I know.. I mean, Thursday. That's a little crazy. A little crazy can be a good thing. Huh.. Do you remember when you quit your job at T's to sell bouquets door to door? Gosh! That was a disaster. And I've never been so humiliated in my whole life. I s-specifically recall one time in Newberry you going, picking flowers from the front yard selling 'em to the owner. I mean, I knew that he would like them. - That's not crazy, is it? - It's completely insane. Well, I was desperate and so dumb. - Yeah. - I mean, we both were. 'I know.' 'God, I miss those days.' I missed you too. Oh, uh.. I'm supposed to meet Hannah for lunch. - I'm late. - Look, I'm sorry. I didn't, I didn't mean it like that. No, um, it's fine. But, uh, I'm just gonna call you in the.. Let's just touch base tomorrow about starting the business plan. - Sure. - Great. This look familiar? 'Yeah, that's me.' - And Laura. - Why do you have this? Because it was stabbed into my front tire. What do you mean, stabbed? I mean, my tires were slashed 'and left this behind.' Wait, you're serious? Did she do this? - Michael! - Jo, I'll, I'll pay for it. I don't care about my car. I wanna know. What have I gotten myself into? Look, I told you, she's been acting strange. - I can see that. - Look, I'm sorry. But I will take care of this, trust me. She will not become a problem. - But she already is one. - I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say about it. You could tell me what's going on between the two of you. - Oh, God. This is so weird. - I know. No, not that. First, someone is looking into my window. Then, someone's following me. And now this, it's like the universe is telling me that this is a bad idea. No, that's all in your head. I don't think so. Look, Jo.. ...you wanna know how I really became CEO? I uncovered the secret to success and I learned to recognize it in other people. It's as simple as that. Well, what is it, the secret? It's grit. Not IQ. Not good looks. - Grit. - Determination. Persistence, force of will. I don't care whether you trade in insurance public power, or flowers. If grit is in the equation that business will be a success and that is why I was interested in Josie's. - Because I have grit? - I know you do. And having grit means not giving up no matter what. 'That's crazy, right?' He said he missed you? Oh, that's what you think is crazy? - I was right. - Huh. That's the reason he came back. No, he didn't mean it, like.. He apologized and everything. Because every time someone apologizes they really mean it. Well? Do you miss him back? Well, Hannah, he is... If he wasn't married, would you miss him? Yes, of course, part of me misses him. The part of me that loved him and was let down by him. And that part doesn't get a say anymore. Okay. I don't wanna talk about me anymore. - Finally. - Shut up! So, what's up with you and Brady? Mm.. Nothing, really. So, everything's alright? Yeah, we talked about it. He has feelings for someone else. It's not a big deal. Honestly, I didn't really like him that much in the first place, it's just, getting rejected like that is so utterly mortifying, you know. - Just embarrassed. - Really? Yeah. Whateverl'm over it. - 'Oh, that looks good.' - 'Yeah, yeah, yeah.' The back of the greens a little bit smooth. - Good morning. - Hey, guys. You know, you never told me that your business partner is also your ex-husband. Oh, yeah. Did I forget to mention that? - You ready? - Sure. Okay, what does this have to do with flowers? Oh, nothing, I just needed a coffee. No, it's just... I thought we should get out. Get some fresh air, get the creative juices flowing. Can I ask you a personal question? Sure. What happened between you and Laura? I mean, I know you don't wanna talk about it but I think I should know considering we're spending so much time together... Look, the truth is.. ...Laura's not well. Couple years back, she started acting erratically. Took her to the hospital, ran some tests. Turns out, it was mental illness. We thought it was schizophrenia but the truth is.. ...nobody really knows. So sorry. Yeah, I tried to get her help. Be there for her, but.. ...she started acting violent. What do you mean, violent? Look, Laura owns a business. Her partner, Dennis, wasn't pulling his own weight and the business was suffering for it. I think her resentment of him turned into a complete delusion. A few weeks ago, he turned up dead. His throat was cut with a scalpel. Oh, my God! The police said the evidence was circumstantial but I believe Laura did it. That's so scary. I can't believe they let her go. She doesn't need jail. She needs professional help. She's behind this, isn't she? What do you mean? Well, we know that she slashed my tires but maybe she's stalking me too. Let's hope not. I think we should go to the police. No, no, like I said, she needs help. I'm on it. You, you focus on Josie's. - What? What is it? - I have an idea. Something that I can create that no one else can. Go on. What if we created an online platform? The tailor makes a bouquet for any situation. No matter how specific. See, flowers have this untapped potential for compassionate communication. Like, for instance, uh, roses are synonymous with Valentine's Day. But what if the 14th comes around and you're not in love, what do you get your crush or your best friend or your ex-husband without sending the wrong message? I don't know. Well, you're not alone. But there's hope, so, at Josie's I am teaching people about flowers' limitless possibilities but also making buying flowers more interactive and fun. It's what I strive to do, and I would be thrilled if you joined me. Thank you, I'll be in touch. Okay, thank you so much. Here, take a rose. - Are you sure? - You did great. Just stop worrying. But John didn't seem impressed. 'That's just how he is.' Regardless of the pitch, he always has that same judgmental look on his face. Makes him a deadly poker player. I heard this one time in Vegas, he.. Michael. Yeah, yeah, put him through. Hey, John. Yeah. Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Okay, thanks. Well? - We got the money? - We got it. - Yes! Yes! - 'Ha-ha-ha!' - Ah! So, um.. - Congrats. Congrats. What'd he say? He said he really likes the idea but what sold him was your passion for it. - Wow! That's amazing. - I know. Thank you so much. - Let's celebrate. - Yes. Oh, I don't drink scotch. - That's right, I forgot. - Yeah. You don't mind if I indulge, do you? - Sure. - It's a little superstitious. But it's become a tradition. You know, pour a little some for me too. - I'll just cheers with you. - Yeah? 'Mm-hm.' Okay. To the vineyard. - So, what.. - So, I was thinking.. - Sorry, go ahead. - No, you first. Um, I was thinking that since we make such great business partners, and.. It's been so great working together that, um.. Um.. What I'm tryin' to say is that, um.. Josie, do you wanna go out on a date with me? - Michael.. - Just.. - Hear me out. - What about our ground rules? 'I don't care about our ground rules.' Well, I do. And we've already tried this once and it didn't work out. Why would we go down that road when we already know where it leads to? Because I'm not the same person that I was before. I was young and immature and lacked perspective but... I know what's important in life now. 'It's not the job or money. It's..' It's people. It's.. 'I know you believe that now.' But what happens when you get comfortable and the infatuation fades away? Michael? It's.. The infatuation... road that we... would be.. Michael? Michael! Oh! Someone call 911! Oh, my God. Michael, are you okay? - Somebody get an ambulance. - What happened? We ran a toxicology report and it came back positive for ketamine. - Ketamine? - Yes. And a copious amount of it too. Sir, have you been experimenting with exotic drugs? Absolutely not. I-I don't even know what that is. Well, ketamine is a powerful dissociative. Medically, it's most commonly used as an anesthetic or for pain management. Or in the veterinary field, it's commonly used as a powerful horse tranquilizer. Uh.. Yeah, I-I really don't know. But thank you for your help. Ketamine? Michael, are you using drugs? - Are you serious? - I don't know. You don't just stub your toe on a syringe of horse tranquilizers. You're lying to me. No, I'm not. After four years of marriage and a divorce you better believe I can tell when you're lying. 'And this is serious.' There is no way that this is a coincidence. Are you in trouble? You better tell me what's going on. - Or I am done. - Look, Jo... 'Cause I don't need the money, I will... Alright, alright. Alright. Fine. It's Laura. She must have spiked my scotch. - Laura? - She's a vet. That explains the horse tranquilizer. I told you, I knew that she was behind this. And I didn't wanna see it. She's not taking well to the divorce. She probably.. Probably what? Uh, I'm just gonna say it. I think she's trying to kill me. Kill you? Why would she try to kill you? I told you, she's not stable. Unstable? That is completely insane. - We have to go to the police. - No, no. We are not, we are not going to the police. Well, we don't have a choice. What if she succeeds, huh? What if... something happens to you? We can't take that chance. Look, she's going through a rough time. She may be mentally ill, but she's still my wife. And I still.. Well, it's not love, but I-I don't wanna see her go to jail. She needs help. Not the opposite. Well, someone has to do something. What if something happens to you? - I'm worried. - I will take care of it. I promise. Just please.. ...do not get involved. I told you, she's dangerous. And I don't want to see you dragged into any of this. - 'Laura will be right in.' - Thank you. Hi, I heard you have some questions about your... poodle. Yeah, I have a couple of questions. - How dare you? - How dare I? How dare you enter my place of business while you're running around with my husband? We're business partners. And I'm here because this is getting out of hand. I understand that you're going through a divorce and that is hard, and that you're struggling. But you have to stop before somebody gets hurt. Stop what? Oh, don't play dumb. The ketamine. You tried to kill him. And this ends now, or else I'm going to the police. I have no idea what you're talking about. Michael told me what you're going through. And I just wanna say, we can help. 'The care you need, it's out there.' Okay. He's manipulating you. Look, when I discovered Michael was cheating on me I got so mad, I.. The point is, I've done some things I regret. But I would never hurt Michael. I loved him. Michael cheated on you? Whatever you're going through, I'm sorry. But don't act so surprised. You were married to him, too. You know what he's capable of. What are you talking about? He's uncompromising. Completely ruthless. It's why I was attracted to him in the first place. But I knew when I filed for a divorce that this would be a battle. Wait. Michael filed for divorce. Because of your breakdown. Excuse me, do I look crazy to you? I operate the most successful vet clinic in LA. Oh, you poor thing. I don't believe you. Listen, after I broke into Michael's house I regained my composure. I've been doing everything by the books. I've hired lawyers. Hell, I even hired a private detective. Unfortunately, even I didn't think Michael would stoop back down to you. So stupid because he's really made it quite easy for me. So, to answer your question.. No. I didn't poison Michael. And that's all there is to know. Now, please, get out of my clinic before I escort you out myself. Hey, there. What is goin' on? Did something happen? - You could say that. - Are you okay? You've been lying to me. Whoa! Whoa, whoa. Slow down. T-t-just tell me what happened. - I spoke with Laura. - You spoke to Laura.. J-Josie, I told you not do that. She's, she's dangerous. She didn't seem dangerous to me. And she didn't seem unstable. In fact, she seemed quite well-spoken. And she told me all about the divorce and about your infidelity and about her breakdown which never happened. Josie, she's lying to you. Why did you drag me into this? - Drag you into what? - The divorce! This is all about the money, isn't it? And you're just using me. What? Why? Why are you using me? Listen to yourself. You're not making any sense. What would I possibly have to gain by dragging you into this mess? I mean, if anything, the fact that we're spending so much time together only hurts my case. - So, there is a case. - Of course there's a case. You've gone through a divorce. You know there's always a case. - Well, Laura said... - Laura just tried to kill me. I-I-I can't believe we're even having this conversation. Jo. I am only here because I care about you and I care about Josie's. I want it to succeed. Do you really? Come with me. Sit. What is that? Just... watch. Now, who do you believe? Me.. ...or the woman destroying my house with a seven iron? Oh, my God. Look. Whatever doubts you have whatever apprehensions you have they're not justified. Laura... is manipulating you. She's exploiting those doubts, trying to drive us apart. - Don't put this on me. - I'm not, but.. You shouldn't have gone to Laura because, now, you're a target too. 'Look, I'm not tryin' to be a, a jerk about this.' 'The divorce took its toll on me, too' but... if we don't put this behind us then this is never gonna work. And Laura's gonna get exactly what she wants. I don't know, Michael. I don't know what to believe anymore. 'I'm not the same person you once knew, Josie.' And whatever I have to do to prove that to you.. ...I will do it. Hey, um.. Are you free? I feel like I need someone to talk to. Okay. Can we just meet? Okay, I'll be right there. - You want my honest opinion? - Yes. Fully knowing that my honesty may not be the answer you're looking for? Just do it. Okay. I think he's right. I think there's no reason that you shouldn't trust him. Objectively, he's been nothing but amazing to you. I mean, you really think so? With Michael, you tend to believe the bad before you see the good. Well, can you blame me? That's not my fault. You really, really want honesty? Yes. I think you need to stop blaming Michael for the divorce. You know, love is a two-way street, and.. ...maybe there's a reason he spent all day working. Ouch. I'm sorry, truth hurts. Well, that's enough truth for today. - I still love you. - 'I know you do.' 'Thank you very much.' 'Seriously, though, Brady is way less complicated than Michael.' 'Michael's got all that Laura stuff' 'all that baggage, you don't need that.' 'Not to mention, he's ridiculously attractive.' Ha-ha-ha. No comment, please. He is! Stop it. - What's.. What's goin' on? - What? Did you leave the door open? No. I don't think so. Someone must've broken in. Be careful. They might still be here. Hello? Hello? Everything is still here. The TV, and the stereo, everything. 'Hello!' Hello! Do you think it was that guy, you know, from the backyard? I don't know. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Josie. I don't think it was the Peeping Tom. I think it was Laura. Hey. How're you holdin' up? I'm fine, I guess. What happened to you, that's really scary. I wish I could do more for you. Being here is enough. Listen, I'm really sorry. You have nothing to be sorry for. Oh, no, no, I'm sorry that I made things really awkward between us. Oh. Do you think that things could just go back to the way they were before? Probably not. I just don't know how I feel. How are we gonna work together? - Maybe we can't. - Really? You wouldn't just throw it all away. I don't wanna just be friends, Josie. Do you love him? Oh, Michael? No, of course not. No, look, listen, if, if this is it between us then I need to tell you everything. I don't think he's right for you. - What makes you say that? - I don't trust him. Maybe you just say that because you're jealous of him. Maybe, uh, maybe it's.. Maybe, it's because I know that you and I... are right for each other. And you don't have anything in common with him. You're making a huge mistake. - Where are you going? - The kitchen. 'Showin' it this weekend sounds great.' 'The sooner we can get this sold, the better.' - 'Thanks for getting in touch.' - 'Yeah, thanks, Michael.' - I really appreciate it. - Talk soon. It's gonna be great. Yeah, can I get Jeff Silverman on the phone, please? Who was that? I gotta go. Hannah, how many times have we talked about you barging into my office? - Not now, Richard. - 'What is it?' Who was that? In the meeting? It's a client. - Michael Robertson? - You know him? 'He's listing his house.' He's got this impeccable lot up in the hills. - Huh. - 'Hm.' Who's the, uh, sales agent? No one yet. If anyone gets that listing, it should be me. - You know that, right? - Hannah. Who sold the Hudson lot in less than two weeks? Or the Craftsman on the west side? Do you really think that Matthew could've sold it that fast? Alright, here are the keys. It's yours if you want. - Thank you, Rich. - 'You're welcome.' - Oh, Hannah? - Yeah? About that house. It needs to be sold as soon as possible. Not two weeks fast, faster. He said it has to go immediately. Of course. Hey, what's up? You'll never guess who I just saw at the office. - Who? - Michael. - Michael? - Yeah. He's listing his house. Did you ow he was in the market? No. I had no idea. Yeah. Well, apparently he is, and he wants it sold fast. Like, now. Yeah. No, he never mentioned that to me. Well, maybe he does have a secret. What if Laura's right? Maybe she did file for a divorce. And he's trying to liquidate his assets. Or maybe trying to hide it or leave LA entirely. I don't know what to believe. Yeah, me neither. But I know how we can find out. I bet it's all in his computer. Well, what're you gonna do, break into his house? Of course not. But if he wants his house sold, like, tomorrow then I have to do a walk-through, like, uh, today. Well, Hannah, don't get yourself in trouble. I won't. I already got clearance from Richard. Apparently, Michael has a meeting. So, I can do it then. Okay. Thanks. Hello? Anybody here? Oh, my God! Oh, shit! Hello? Argh! Hey, Hannah. Josie! I'm at Michael's house. Now, listen very carefully to what I'm about to say. Wait, shh! Hold on a second. Hannah? Laura? Hannah! Hannah, just tell me what you were gonna say! Hannah? Hannah? Pick up the phone, Hannah! Come on! 'Hi, you've reached Hannah.' 'Leave a message at the beep.' Hannah! Hannah! - Where's Hannah? - What's goin' on? - Where's Hannah? Hannah! - Who? - Hannah, my best friend! - I haven't seen her. - I just got back from dinner. - It's Laura! I think she's inside, but please open the door. I think she's in trouble! Hannah? Here, you check upstairs! Okay. Hannah? Whoa! Hannah.. No. No! No! No, please! Oh, please, no! Hannah! 'Michael!' Jo? Michael, please! Please! Oh, my God! She's dead. She's dead.. No, she can't be, please! Jo. We gotta get outta here. - No! No! - We gotta get outta here. - C'mon! C'mon, c'mon, c'mon. - No! No! The last time we were together.. ...she told me some things that I wasn't ready to hear. She said to stop blaming you.. ...for the divorce. So, how're you holdin' up? You know... best we can. Can you think of any reason why Laura would wanna hurt Hannah... Laura didn't know Hannah. She was looking for me. She warned me.. ...that next time she saw me with Michael that she'd kill me. And then, she found Hannah in his house, and.. So it was a mistake? Laura thought Hannah was you? Michael.. Why was Laura at your house in the first place? This wasn't the first time she broke into my house. You see, Laura and I have been going through 'a-a rough divorce, and..' ...process has made her.. ...well, for lack of a better term, unhinged. 'I think she broke in fully intending to kill me.' And took advantage of the opportunity to kill who she thought was Josie.. ...because she knows how I feel about Josie. What do you mean by that? I mean, throughout our marriage Josie has always been a touchy subject. Laura is a very jealous person. Jealous enough to kill? Apparently. 'Have you found her yet?' We've... looked at her house. We've checked with her coworkers. We've checked everywhere we can think of. Well, well, what do we do? I mean, what if she comes after us? We have our best men and women working around the clock to try and track her down. I can assign one of our officers to your house if you want. Or you're free to go out of town if it'll give you some peace of mind. Just... keep your phones close and don't hesitate to call. I know a place. I'm sorry. Maybe I, I shoulda never come back. Maybe.. Maybe she'd still be alive. Don't say that. You know what else Hannah told me? No, I don't. 'She told me your secret' that you're selling your house. Michael, I wanna believe you that you've changed. I wanna try this, but I know that y're lying to me. I just can't figure out why. Are you liquidating your assets? Are you trying to hide your money? No, I am not. Then why are you selling your house? I didn't just sell my house. I sold everything. Jo, I stepped down as CEO. What? Why? I'll show you. 'Where are we?' 'It was supposed to be surprise.' At least, a happy one. What do you mean? - It's beautiful. - Yeah. Walk with me. Had my eye on this vineyard for a while. Well, what do you know about owning a vineyard? Josie, how do you think I became a CEO of my company? I do my research. These grapes are cabernet sauvignon. Still one of the most popular wines not only in California, but the whole world. And California is known to make some of the best. I've been talking to a lot of the most widely respected winemakers in California. My goal... is to make a premium cabernet. This is the reason for consolidating your assets? It's a very expensive endeavor. But.. ...it's worth every dollar I have to show you I mean what I say. And here's the best part. Incorporated into the tasting room will be a flower shop. I think it'll make a great headquarters. How does Dahlia Vineyard sound to you? It's your favorite flower. - I like it. - Yeah? Michael, this is completely insanely crazy. Well, you know how I feel about crazy. Sometimes, it's a good thing. It's just like I've always pictured it. Well, I know the timing's off and I wish you could enjoy it more, but.. ...hopefully, it'll make you feel better. Yeah. Come on. So charming, and.. What the.. 'I had my assistant bring it up.' I want this to be the place of your dreams. Our dreams. Why don't you... go find the perfect place for it? - 'I'll go get some groceries.' - 'Okay.' Yeah? Okay. Did you get a good workout? Yeah, these groceries are no joke. - You want some help with those? - No. Relax. Let's see. - Here you go. - Thanks. - Are you gonna have one? - Of course. - To the vineyard. - To the vineyard. So, Jo, um.. ...I do have a secret. And I wanna tell you the truth. You showed me that Josie's is more than just a flower shop that has amazing potential but... that first day I showed up.. ...it wasn't about business. Then why did you come? I came for you, Josie. I missed you. - Michael... - And.. I still love you. Someone's in the house. Come on, come on! - Well, call 911! - In here! Now! Whatever you do, stay in here and keep this door locked. But.. 'Laura?' 'Lau-Lau-Laura, listen to me. Just calm down!' 'We can work this out, I..' 'I-I still care about you.' 'Just put down the gun!' 'Put down the.. No!' Michael! Michael! Oh, my God. We can be together. We can put everything into Josie's and make it work. All you have to do is tell them what happened. And when you're done.. ...everything we've ever dreamed about.. ...it can be ours. Just tell 'em the truth. And what is the truth? She had a gun. But I don't know whether it was the look in her eye or the fact that she'd completely given up but I know... she was gonna shoot. Okay, so, then what happened? After she missed, I jumped at her. I wrestled her to the ground, I took the gun from her, and.. I'm so sorry. Come here, everything is gonna be okay. And then I heard a scuffle.. ...and plates falling.. ...and then some groaning and then the gunshot. I thought that she had killed Michael. I'm sorry you had to go through that. Josie. Do you think it's possible that Michael wanted to kill Laura? Are you implying that he did it on purpose? I don't know either way. All I'm saying is that they were going through a divorce. So, I have to explore the possibility that he took advantage of the opportunity. Detective. Let's get one thing straight. Laura was a disturbed individual. And she attempted to kill Michael on multiple occasions. And how did he respond? He didn't even call the police. Because he cared about her. And he believed that she could get better. And, so, I think it is fair to say that when Michael shot Laura, it was the last thing in the world he wanted to do. So, that was the second time he shot her. What do you mean? You're telling me that Michael shot Laura but only in the leg, then she attacked him and then that was the second time he shot her. He shot her... once. That was the first time he shot her, the only time. Josie, Laura was shot twice. No, there must be some mistake. Laura had the gun, and she shot at Michael and she missed. And, then, he took the gun from her. We can take a walk to the morgue, if you'd like. Laura was shot twice. Once in the leg, and once in the chest. The body proves it. - Hey! - 'How did it go?' Fine. Just fine? N-no, it went well. 'Great.' 'Well, I was thinking' we could go back to the vineyard. Try again at that dinner? 'What do you think?' Josie? Yo, dinner sounds great. Um, why don't I meet you there tonight? I just gotta stop by the shop first. Great. I'll see you then. Bye. Hello? Anybody here? Hello? Shit! Oh, my God! - 'This is Detective Baker.' - Detective, this is Josie. Check your inbox. There's something that you need to see. 'Don't be.' 'Timing is perfect.' There you go. - Cheers. - Is this from the vineyard? Yeah, it is. - How do you like it? - It's smooth and dry. - I like it. - Yeah. Yeah, apparently, all the coastal air settles here in this valley. Makes it a little colder than LA, but.. ...paradise for the grapes. I can tell. - Hey, Michael? - Yes. Can you run me through what happened when you shot Laura? Just one more time. Is that really what you wanna talk about over a nice glass of wine? No, I just feel like we should have our story straight you know, for Detective Baker? Relax, I'm sure you did great. Alright, fine. But, please, can we talk about something afterwards? I'm not sure I wanna keep reliving killing my wife. Sorry, I promise. When I left the bedroom.. I found Laura holding a gun. So I... I-I wrestled it away from her, and.. ...well, you know. But, um, look.. ...she's gone now. We don't have to worry about her anymore. Or the divorce. I'm a free man now. You sure about that? Yeah, pretty sure. No, are you sure you have your story straight? Of course, I am. Did you shoot her once or twice? - What are you talking about? - Just answer the question. Twice! But I had to. - She was trying to kill me. - That's not what you told me. - You told me you shot her once. - No, I didn't. After it happened, you told me that she took a shot at you and she missed, and then you shot her. Jo, it all happened so quickly. I don't think you're remembering this correctly. Stop lying, Michael. Just tell the truth! Why was Laura here in the first place? You know why she was here. She followed us here. - Because she was... - Insane! Yeah. Maybe you're the one that's insane. Maybe you're a pathological liar. This is ridiculous. After everything I've done for you! I bought you a vineyard for crying out loud. I don't have to sit here and listen to you accuse me of being crazy. You know... the last thing that Hannah said to me.. ...I finally realized what it meant. She yelled "Laura" not because Laura was attacking her but because she found her bound and gagged in your house. Why did you kill my friend? I.. Don't move. Michael! Michael! 'Stop!' 'Michael!' Michael, stop! Don't move! Everything.. ...that's happened.. ...has just been to turn me against Laura. 'She was never the villain.' She just wanted a divorce. It was all you, all along. And why would I do something so crazy? You knew that she would get everything. So, then, you.. So, you killed her and made it look like you were the victim. You just needed my testimony. My only question is, why me? I had the perfect plan. Kill Laura's business partner and frame her for it. But that didn't work. So, I asked myself.. ...what was I missing? The answer was you, Jo. I needed an eyewitness and you were the perfect candidate. How could you? When we split, I had nothing. So, I put my head down and I worked as hard as I could to get where I am. Now, what did Laura do, huh? She was a successful vet! And who do you think gave her the money to start that clinic? That didn't mean she deserved to die. Listen, Jo.. I did.. ...fall in love with you all over again. The vineyard.. It was never a part of the plan. You never intended to stay here. You were always gonna disappear. Oh, no! Give that... gun. You will not ruin this for me. 'Drop the gun!' Put the gun down. 'Sir, drop the gun.' 'No!' Oh. Ugh! 'Ma'am, drop the gun.' Drop the gun, drop the gun. Drop it. 'Unit 11, code three. We have a suspect down.' 'White male, early 30s, gunshot to the abdomen.' What do we have here? Actually, I'm finishing up a special order. For you. Who gives a florist a bouquet? That would be your investor friend. John Miller? What do we have here? It's clovers, laurels, Canterbury bells.. So, industry, success, gratitude which all together means.. He's a big fan of yours. Yeah, I think so. Well, why wouldn't he be after all you've done for him? Speaking of all you've done.. Why don't you let me take you out to celebrate all the progress you've made? Are you asking me out on a date? Hey! You're back. How'd it go? I need some more flowers. A lot more flowers. Brady, uh, dozen red roses, please. - I'm on it. - Great, thanks! Wow! So, congratulations. - Thank you. - Sounds like things went well. The red rose was perfect. She fell in love with it. Oh! Fantastic. It's all thanks to you.
