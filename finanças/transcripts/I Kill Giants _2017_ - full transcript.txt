KAREN: I worked overtime again, Barely made it home to make dinner for my beloved siblings. No, he offered me the promotion! Basically. It was implied. FRIEND: Come on! Switch weapons! You're never gonna win with that BB gun! You're never gonna get laid with that haircut. - Dave, really? - Really. It's a shitty haircut. We have the same haircut. You guys should try a real game. Use some imagination. BARBARA: Save some electricity. I have a good beginner dungeon. DAVE: Yeah, good luck with that nerd queen! Watch those corners! FRIEND: Oh God! No! DAVE: Shit! Can you at least quiet down a little? DAVE: Switch around! Switch around! DAVE: Shit! Yes... ...and wave it like a flag. DAVE: Oh shit, oh shit. (Distant ringing) That was a saving throw. I rolled to see if you'd survive a blackout spell. You didn't. See? Isn't that fun? What the hell is wrong with you? Dinner's ready, so the game's over anyway. Damn right it's over. I busted my ass on that, you punk! Smells like your ass too! Jesus, Dave! My mom's making vegan crap for dinner. I wanted meat! KAREN: I'm not making anything else! (Slams door) The die never lie. I'd play your Dragons or whatever if you asked me to. That would be hilarious. - You're serious? Why not? You make it sound like... I don't know, I'm just saying that I would play if you asked me to. (Phone vibrates) When, exactly? Can you hang on a second. It's a shower night tonight, so lights out at 9:30. It wouldn't kill you to wash a dish either. Hey. Nothing really. It's just the usual. KAREN: My brother is a snarling ball of anger and my sister is... herself. KAREN: Good times. "Dishes." You really need to prioritize. (Low ominous music) She just wants to play with you. DAVE: By unplugging the TV? DAVE: Embarrassing me in front of my friends? KAREN: Dave, you're on that thing all the time. KAREN: Barbara is reaching out, and that's good. DAVE: No, it's weird and stupid! - Why do you care... Not so loud or she'll hear us talking. (Voices whispering) (Deep exhale increasing in volume) RADIO: ...it popped up again! On third, Hayes has room. Hayes makes the catch! (Melancholy piano over radio) Thurisaz. The Thorn. The Hammer. Take the force of my enemy and send it back to him a thousand thousand times. Time to work. (Pulsing music) One, two, three, four, five, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen... Hi. Are you playing a game? I don't think so. SOPHIA: Oh. If you were, I would... join you or... I don't know. I'm Sophia. We just moved here from Leeds, England. No one here knows Leeds. Only London. SOPHIA: It's stinky. - What's it for? - Pray you never find out. What's with the ears? Tribute to my spirit guide. Oh! That's interesting. SOPHIA: I, uh... Nice meeting you. You have a pretty name. - And I like the way you talk. - Thank you. What's your... Okay... thanks. KAREN: I understand what "these times" require, sir. Well, we're allowed three personal days, and I know that Mr. Guggenheim considers personal attendance. No, my sister, she's just a kid, she can't help, she's... She can't help with anything. Um, I'm not a special case. I'm just asking for common courtesy! No, obviously, I want to keep my job. I'm just... Okay. Okay, thank you so much, thank you. Okay, bye. Bye. (Cries softly) (Ominous music) Can I look too? Thanks! We're at the same bus stop. Hi, again. Wow, that looks so cool! Yeah, that's it. Dark Omens are totally "cool". What does that mean? It means my life is about to get complicated. Again. Can I sit next to you? Why? You're the only kid I know in like, all of America. SOPHIA: Hi. (Indistinct talking) (Bell rings) Nine... Ten... Eleven... Twelve... Thirteen... Fourteen... Thirty-four... Thirty-five... Thirty-six... Thirty-seven... Thirty-eight... Damn it! - Excuse me. - You're excused. (Bell rings again) (Students chattering) You make a better door than window. My table. You owe me a toll. Give it. (Gasps) That's all I got. Keep the change. You're dead! TEACHER: Barbara Thorson! Barbara Thorson! Mrs. Moll√©'s office, now. Please! Have fun at the shrink, psycho. She is so weird. MOLLE: You might not believe this, know more about Birch than I do. I'm new here, so you're the expert. And I was hoping you can tell me a little bit about what you like here, what you don't. I already heard to stay away from the beef teriyaki. I really like your pocketbook. It's nice. I don't know what Covliski means. Cov... Covliski. What does it mean? Strike one. What? Barbara, you're not being tested. We're just talking. For the record, I'm not being difficult because I think your profession is B.S. I'm just busy so I don't have time to be delicate with your feelings. So you don't even want to know why you're here? I'm here because people fear what they don't understand. I'm good with that, so we're done here. And next time, use a sky writer to call me to the shrink's office. - Less embarrassing. - No, I told them... Yeah. Wow... You think it's funny to spit on people? Not "ha-ha" funny, but existentially, yes. You're a disgusting little bitch. Open your pocketbook. What I find, I keep. If you don't walk away, right now, I will do things to you that will make God cry. - (Sniggers) - PRINCIPAL: Taylor! What's going on? My office. Now. A week's suspension. PRINCIPAL: Let's go. BARBARA: You're pretty brave for someone who looks like they live in a magazine. SOPHIA: I saw Taylor grab you and got the principal. You stood up to her. Think you didn't? You think I did? I did. She's gonna kill me. No. BARBARA: Taylor's a bully. All bullies are the same: Soon as you stand up to them, they crumble. Just like giants. Giants? Like in your books? Dragons and stuff? You like that? It's weird? I don't know. Yeah. A little. What's so cool about giants? BARBARA: This is my sanctuary. A holy place. You want to know about giants, you learn here. It's been said That all giants are descended from Ur, the first giant, who was the misbegotten son of the Earth and Sky. Twenty miles tall... What? Misbegotten means the Earth and the Sky did it, but they weren't married? Yeah. My older brother was misbegotten. Okay. So Ur is twenty miles tall, but he's alone. He's the only one. He's so lonely that in his anguish, he tears himself apart. Giving birth to giants. (Groans) The first dark kings of the Earth. Or at least that's what they liked to think. Giants are vermin, like rats or pigeons. But huge, of course. They can hit thirty feet and come in all flavors. Frost Giants have hair of living ice, and use human kidney as a garnish when they eat reindeer. Swamp Giants will clear out a whole village of people, just to replace them with dolls made of vines. Mountain Giants bathe in the blood of children, and have a penchant for singing shepherd songs. Oh and these creeps, they're Harbingers. They just like to watch. Totally sketchy. You see a Harbinger, a Giant is around. (Rumbling) Even worse, though, Titans. These are the big guys. Like Greek myth stuff. Hearts of blackest opal. A laugh boils your blood in your body. Eyes that make the sun go out. Can you imagine that? Something so horrible, the sun won't shine on it. Don't be scared. No one's seen a Titan since the dawn of recorded history. Good. The real problem is regular giants. Total dicks. This has been a bad year for giants. People always write them off as tornadoes and earthquakes and crap, but if you open your eyes, you see the omens and know the truth. Ever lose a dog? SOPHIA: Yeah, it got hit by a car. - BARBARA: Probably not. Probably hors d'oeuvres for a giant. - No, my dad backed over it. - Oh. Lucky. So what if we do see the omens and one really comes? That's where I come in. I find giants. I hunt giants. I kill giants. With this. Inside this modest sheath slumbers the finest war hammer ever made. Thunder-maker. Light bringer. Forged from a fragment of bone from the jaw of Ur himself... One perfect strike will drop even the tallest of giants. Can I see it? This is a sacred vessel. Can only be opened when duty calls. "Coveleski." Weapons of great renown have to have a name. Coveleski was a baseball player. A rookie for the Philadelphia Phillies 100 years ago. Are you okay? What's the matter? Barbara? BARBARA: Sorry... I have to go. Barbara! Hey! You don't want to get too close to me. People close to me get hurt. (Suspenseful music) (Short breaths) (Distant rumbling) (Distant squawk) (Suspenseful pulsating music) (Big thuds) (Growls deeply) (Leaves crunching) (Deep grumbling) (Groans louder) (Growls) (Growling continues) (Growling grows louder) - (Grunts) - I'm over here! Now this way, you big idiot. Damn it... (Sparse chiming music) (Distant whisper) Barbara! (Short breaths) Barbara! (Hissing) Barbara! Barbara! (Hissing and cracking) Barbara! (Eerie music) (Hissing stops) BARBARA: I made a friend. Her name is Sophia. She wears nice clothes, but... She's English so that's to be expected. So, see? I'm normal. Can I go now? There's serious stuff going down I have to deal with it. Do you have many friends? Right. Why not, Barbara? Because most kids my age care more about who's on TV or if they have cool sneakers than talking to me. And I'm a little mean to people who are dumb. And most people are dumb. What about your sister. Is Karen dumb? Family is "strike two" territory. Barbara... I'm sorry. Sometimes I know I push too hard too soon, but it's only because I want to get to know you a bit more. Okay? Okay, I'll go first. I wasn't always a school psychologist... That would be impossible unless you were cloned from one. - I assume you were a baby. - Yes, I was a baby. Then a child, then a young woman, a manager of a small hedge fund. The good kind or did you rip off old ladies? I wasn't sure. So I decided I wanted to try something else. I thought I could make a difference doing this. Is that corny? - The word "corny" is corny. - (Laughs) Wanting to make a difference is nice, but you're thinking too small. Call me when you've saved a town, and we can compare notes. Have you saved a town? I protect this dump like once a month just don't go around bragging about it. What do you protect us from? If you have to ask, then you clearly haven't read my file. I have a file. Yes, but this file doesn't tell me who you are, how you feel. Delicious! Right. ‚ô™Rasmus Walter: "Something So Strong"‚ô™ Gumbs, Nehring, Rugg, you're in red. The rest of you are blue today. BARBARA: You know that forest giant I told you about? He's getting ballsy! We have to find him. I don't want to get anyone into trouble. We're already in trouble. COACH: Hey! L'il Posh Spice! Zip it! Thorson, drop the book. Huddle up! Today we're gonna take a stab at America's favorite pastime: baseball. Miss Laney? Can I be excused? I probably have food poisoning or a twisted ankle. It's just baseball, Thorson. You hardly have to do anything. Just stand there... - I'll take the F. Thanks. - I thought you liked baseball. You said Coveleski was a... MISS LANEY: Harry Coveleski? That's some obscure baseball history, Thorson. Coveleski hasn't played in like a hundred years. You got any Phillies fans in the family? Miss Laney, would you describe your job as worthless or utterly pointless? Principal's office. Now. I cherish our times together. You really are the Dalai Lama of principals. Do you want me to make it a month? No thank you, sir. Namaste. Get out of here. Cool. (Ringing) BARBARA: This is a sacred vessel. It can only be opened when duty calls. No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I wasn't really... wasn't really going to open it. (Hushed whispers) I'm sorry. I have forgotten myself. My holy quest. Coveleski is sacred. It won't ever happen again. I swear. I swear. I swear. (Strained breaths) (Fire alarm) Please follow staff instructions and proceed in an orderly fashion to your assigned areas outside of the building... TEACHER: Okay, please. Move along. Lucy, Jim. Where are you going? There's still three periods! Did you get the note? There are times where you have to ask yourself, "Do I want to live my life as a coward or a warrior?" Decide. (Sparse piano notes) (Majestic symphonic music) SOPHIA: Where are we going? I've been working on a plan trying to lead it away from the town to the old train graveyard. (Bats screeching) Stay close. Stay calm. It's not gonna hurt you while I'm here. Barbara, how long is this gonna take? Be quiet. It's up ahead. - We're gonna get in trouble. - We're gonna save this town. It should have taken second bait. Something else must've grabbed its attention. There is no way this wouldn't work. - We have to go back. We'll say we got locked out by accident. Hold on. You need to understand what we're dealing with. Giants aren't real. Then why are you sweating? BARBARA: (Sighs) There you have it. Can't compete with a baby deer. Once they find food they don't go for the bait. We're going to have to track it. I want to see if it took a bite out of this guy, though. Might tell me what we're dealing with. It sucked it up good. It's pretty drained. This is weird, Barbara. I want to go home. Now. Please! Sophia! (Flies buzzing) (Creak) (Whispers) Harbingers... (Low grumbling) (Haunted voice) What good will you be against real monsters? Even a dim-witted forest giant has baffled you... twice! It will be back. (Deep rumbling) Just a child, so weak, so weak. Do you have wood in your garage? You won't get in trouble. Just don't tell anyone and it'll protect you. Harbingers are creeps. You don't want them around you. Are you afraid of blood? Yes. Don't look. Just squeeze the ice. I don't like this. - I know you're into it, but... - It's your ward of protection. It has to be your blood. I do it all the time without any ice. Come on. Sophia, I know I'm an awkward freak. I know that no one likes me. I know that everything I do looks crazy. But this will protect you when I'm not around. And I'd feel better knowing that you're safe. Trust me. Look into my eyes and say this: Thurisaz. The Thorn. The Hammer. Thurisaz. The Thorn. The Hammer. Take the force of my enemy and send it back to him a thousand thousand times. Take the force of my enemy and send it back to him a thousand thousand times. Are you gonna do it? I did it when you looked at my eyes. Thank you. there's a high drive, left field, well hit! Back there, it is... a home run! RADIO: (Crowd cheers) It's a long fly ball... KAREN: Barbara! Barbara? Barbara? I can hear your tapes in the whole house. I have to be up early tomorrow. I sure do! High finance is a man's world, I don't let anything get me down because I have gumption! (Lowers voice) I chew gumption after every meal! Stinky! Beloved cubicle-mate. Have I told you lately if you only smelled like butt dipped in tuna that would be an improvement? I think Stinky needs to get to bed. Luckily I, Glorious Guggenheim, will save you from a life of drudgery and olfactory assault with... a promotion! Ah thank you so much, Mr. Guggenheim! KAREN: It's very nice of you. But I don't need a pity promotion. I'm gonna figure this out. That's the smartest thing you've ever said, big Karen. Thank you, little Karen. Perhaps I should talk to my little sister more too. (Soft piano) I'm trying, Barbara. MOLLE: Today I wanna try something new. A game. People play too many games with one another. Let's just keep it honest. Okay. Honestly? I put my neck on the line to keep you out of suspension after your little stunt in gym class. It's a word game. I say a word and you say a word back, okay? Like... game. No! I... lose. Diamond. Fake. Mrs. Moll√©, Things are happening. I have to go... - Baseball. Baseball. Baseball. Barbara... You're holding my hand. It's okay. I'm your friend. Someone that you can talk to if case you're having problems. - I have to go to the bathroom... - Like if you're... angry, if you're... afraid. - Please let me go. - Whatever's making you sad... - Please let me go. - Like what's going on at home. (Her voice echoes) (Echoing) With Karen and Dave... (Rumbling) BARBARA (Chants): Kinarus, kinarus (Soft chanting echoes and fades) SOPHIA: Coveleski... BARBARA: Weapons of great renown have to have a name. Barbara... MRS. MOLLE: A game. MRS. MOLLE: I say a word and you say a word back. Barbara... (Voices continue to echo) Baseball. COACH: Harry Coveleski... BARBARA: Coveleski was a baseball player, a rookie for the Philadelphia Phillies. COACH: That's some obscure baseball history, Thorson. any Phillies fans in the family? BARBARA: Sophia! Nice one, psycho. - I'm sorry! I didn't... - She's a total psycho. Sophia! Please... (Bats screeching) Sorry dinner's late. Sorry dinner's gonna suck. Call the coast guard. The red tide's in. I had to kiss ass and stay late today because my day got derailed by a long phone call. We all had issues today, Karen - I'm trying to move forward. - You hit a goddamn teacher! I would never hit a teacher. They don't get paid enough for that abuse. - She's a psychologist. - Are you freaking mental? Ouch! Son of a bitch! I can't do this. How am I suppoed to do this by myself? You two won't grow up and help me. I can't deal with you going crazy! Because when you act out, they call me up at work and then I have to deal with your shit. and it's a problem for me because I'm trying my best to hold everything together. Barbara. This is not fair, Barbara! Hey, this is not fair! - You're not running away! - Yes, I am! No, you're not running away! Why are you fighting me? I'm trying to help you. So is the shrink! If you want to fight somebody, then you can stand up to that bully at school! Says the whiney doormat who can't talk to her own boss! You have no idea what I've given up for you. Neither do you! TAYLOR: She's crazy, but she knows how to punch. It... was an accident. It did not look like an accident. She's my friend. Shouldn't be. TAYLOR: People will start talking about you too. Besides, crazy people can't have friends. It's part of their sickness. I get it. You're a nice kid. You want to help her, like a dog with a broken leg. But the only way to help a crazy person is to expose their sickness. You've seen her do crazy stuff, right? I bet she showed you her traps and weird shit! I like you. You're pretty. You could be cool. I'll make you a deal. You telll me some of the crazy stuff... and I'll tell you a secret about your friend. Close the door, please. Tell me about giants. How come I'm not expelled? I know you called Karen. People in New Jersey know you called Karen. Why didn't you tell the principal? Everyone gets one. I can excuse one. Do I need to expand? Why do giants have to die? I mean, looking at them, they look pretty silly to me. If I can remember, Mickey Mouse beat giants twice with no problem. Those are so stupid! God! A giant comes to a place... and destroys everything in its path. Worse than that. It's not like a dumb cartoon or something. A giant... What? A giant... is hate. Smashing stuff isn't enough. A giant takes. It takes everything from you. And when it's done... It's like anything that made your life good was never even there. It's horrible. Barbara... are you afraid of giants? No. I'm not afraid of them. Because I have Coveleski. With this I can stop it. If I'm strong enough. If I stay focused. If I'm worthy... I can stop death itself. Coveleski sounds very special. May I see it? SOPHIA: After school! TAYLOR: No! - SOPHIA: I'll show you then. - TAYLOR: Now is perfect. What's going to happen? Barbara, please stay! Damn it. TAYLOR: Look at all this crap! I told you. Giant traps. What a freak! Hilarious. Can we burn this shit? Ugh! Ugh. BARBARA: Stop it, Taylor! Stop it or I'm going to kill you. She told us about your stupid junk down here. TAYLOR: She knows you're a messed up psycho. You gonna kill her too? She'll get hers. You said you weren't gonna do anything. BARBARA: Worry about yourself. Coveleski is about to speak. Come on. She's nothing. (Distant ringing) What happened to it? SOPHIA: I'm sorry! Fight back! SOPHIA: Sorry! Barbara! (Wind howling) (Floor creaks) (Whispers) Sophia... Why did you bring me upstairs? We never go upstairs! Come here! Slowly. Please! Don't let it see you. (Whimpers) (Whispers) Sophia! (Slams door) (Floor creaks) (Deep tone) (Hissing whispers) (Hissing gets louder) (Hissing stops) - Mrs. Moll√©! - Barbara? I'm sorry. (Sniffling) It's the 21st century. Everyone knows where everyone lives. What happened to you? Something's wrong with me. No, honey. There's nothing wrong with you. - (Baby crying) - There she is! We're so happy Mommy's home, aren't we? - Just one second. - We've been crying for an hour. Daddy's about to jump into the bay. MRS. MOLLE: Oh my gosh. - Momma's here, Momma's here... - (Baby cries louder) Momma's here. It's okay. Oh, you picked up a stray? MOLLE: This is my friend, Barbara. Hey. Barbara, this is my husband and here is the reason why I've been tired all the time. Her name is Jacqueline, also known as Mrs. Fussy Colicky Pants. Yeah. MRS. MOLLE: She's doing better. She's going to die. - What did she say? - No, it's fine. Everyone's going to die. Do you want to come inside? Wait, Barbara. Barbara, come inside! Barbara! (Baby cries) (Thunder rumbles) ‚ô™London Grammar: "Under the Stars"‚ô™ (Sniffles) Where are you? Come fight me! Let me call you right back. Karen? KAREN: It's just not possible because I put her on the bus myself every day. MRS. MOLLE: Not the last few days, apparently. I have to leave before the bus, but I pack her giant goddamn book bag and make breakfast. I've left messages, Ms. Thorson. A lot of the time I just leave out cereal and milk. Or... I don't... I think yesterday Dave ate left over chicken surprise. It's all falling apart. I'm falling apart. You've done the best you can. (Soft sparse piano) Coveleski. WOMAN'S VOICE: In 1908, Harry Coveleski, a left-handed rookie from the coal mines of Pennsylvania was thrust into the spotlight when... BARBARA: The pitcher was called to the mound by the Philadephia Phillies to do battle against the unstoppable New York Giants. WOMAN: At the tender age of twenty-one, Coveleski stunned the nation. By decimating the Giants' lineup - three times in five days... BARBARA: Mom, let me do this part! Coveleski's story captured the hearts and minds of fans across the nation, earning him the nickname The Giant Killer. The Giant Killer. BARBARA'S MOM: See, you never give up, Barbara. Oh I wish I could have seen those games. BARBARA: But then you'd be old. (Giggles) Manny said I could use the table. Why weren't you at school? Do you know what a meme of malcontent is? It's when someone can think a name and send a person to hell, where their skin is cooked off and made into pies for demons. I'm meme-ing you right now. I brought Mrs. Moll√© to your house. - You're scaring us, Barbara... - I'm scaring you? When bloody parts of people fall out of the sky and all you can see is red, then you'll be scared. And it'll be your fault. Because you betrayed me! Coveleski is broken! Because of you and your bony-ass skeleton friend, Taylor! Without it I'm nothing. I won't be able to stop the giant... - There is no giant! Just stop! I trusted you! Then why didn't you tell me about... (Deep rumbling) Stupid! HARBINGER: Pathetic. Weaker than before, playing your game as the giant draws near. HARBINGER 2: We waste our time. You have no spirit for this. Lost. Confused. Friendless. When it finds you, you will find yourself alone and quivering. Prove yourself. Prove yourself. Now! It's waiting at the edge of the forest. (Deep rumbling) (Low groaning) (Dramatic music) (Huffing and grunting) (Short breaths) (Growls) (Gasps) (Growls) (Grunts and growls) (Grumbles in pain) (Music softens) What did you do? I saved you and every other idiot in this stupid town. But tell me again I'm crazy. BARBARA: I've kept my solemn oath. I've kept the darkness at bay. I have shown my worth. Please return Coveleski to me. RADIO: What we see on Doppler radar, is a rapidly developing front along the Jersey coastline. Very rare for this time of year and surprisingly powerful. KAREN: Barbara? Three hours ago, we were forecasting a sunny weekend, and now... Barbara? Practically out of nowhere. Some counties in Southern New York are issuing tornado warnings. I highly doubt we're gonna see that... (Phone rings) - Hello? - Karen? Hi. Hi, it's Mrs. Moll√©. Is Barbara with you? No, she didn't go to school? She came to school, yes. But... There was an incident with Taylor. What, another fight? No, something else. Barbara went after Taylor. It was very upsetting. The details don't matter now. I just want to make sure that Barbara's okay. BARBARA: Elder spirits, I have killed the giant and set my house in order. Please. Give it back. MRS. MOLLE: You ok? - Taylor? - I'm gonna kill that bitch! TEACHER: Taylor! You get back here, right now. (Pulsating music) PA: Attention, students... Stop! Barbara! PA:grab your things and report to... Barbara! Go home. Go hug your... family. I thought it was over, but something's wrong. I thought I could sacrifice Taylor, but they need more. I didn't want to kill anything. That's black magic. - This stuff is already dead. - Barbara... Barbara, I went to your house. Go home, please. - Let me work! - You work isn't real! Let's just get in the car. I'll take you home. You're not listening to me! Another giant is coming. If I don't fix Coveleski, I can't kill it! Barbara. Your mother... wants to see you. (Melancholy music) Why are you acting weird? I don't... I don't have... - The giant... - No! No! Okay? Your mother is sick. Do you understand? That's reality, Barbara. - And you have to face it. - No! Barbara! SOPHIA: Stop it! I said stop! Shut up! She's not even your friend! That freak crossed the line! She's not a freak. Her mom is sick, okay? Really sick! I am her friend! I don't give a shit. You can all die together. Ahh! I hate you! I hate you! SOPHIA: Barbara! What happened? I tried to stop her but... It's okay! Come on, we have to get inside. My leg... SOPHIA: What's happening? BARBARA: It's time. - Take cover. - We have to get inside! Sophia... Please. If you can't run, hide. Now. Barbara! (Thunder rumbles) (Ominous music) (Deep grumbling) Oh no... It's a titan. (Roars) (Snarls) (Grumbles) (Growls) You can't have her! - (Groans) You can't have her, you hear me? You will not hurt my mother! (Growls) (Deep grumbling breaths) I beat you. I beat you! (Groans) My mom is going to live because I beat you. She is going to live! TITAN: Little warrior... you fought with honor. But I did not come for her. I came for you. I came... for you. But I beat you. I beat you. I know, child. I know. I can't save her? (Low grumbling) So finish it. (Yells) (Music escalates) (Music softens) (Stifled cry) TITAN: All things that live in this world die. This is why you must find joy in the living, while the time is yours. And not fear the end. To deny this is to deny life. But... (Muffled cry) to embrace it. Can you embrace it? (Muffled) Barbara! (Epic music escalates) You are stronger than you think. RADIO: Climatologists are dumbfounded by the storm that ripped through Long Island. There've been no significant tornadoes in this area for decades. The conditions to generate such a storm are considered extremely rare. There were no warning signs and nothing officials could do. Miraculously, despite the devastation, there were only minor injuries and no casualties. (Harmonious music) (Sniffles) Mom? I'm scared to open my eyes. Am I dreaming? No, Mom. No. There was a big storm. I heard it. Was it scary? No. I'm not scared of storms. Neither am I. They can be... They can be sort of beautiful. And then afterwards, it's so quiet. - I'm sorry, Mom. - Shh. I'm sorry I was scared to see you. Hush... Hush, now. (Music escalates) TEACHER: Let's get right to it! Who wants to tell me something interesting they did this summer? Alright, I'll pick a brave volunteer. Barbara Thorson? My break wasn't very interesting. I needed a lot of rest, so... I ate, slept, played. Hung out with my mom. She also killed a Titan with her bare hands! Technically, that was before the holidays. And she used a hammer. But she did that too. TEACHER: Um, right. - Okay... Anybody else? - (Knocking) Barbara. Is it time? Karen's on her way. The doctor says it's soon. Are you afraid? There's nothing to be afraid of. Okay. Are you ready? ‚ô™Broken Twin: "A Glimpse of a Time"‚ô™ (Distant thuds) (Low groan) Thank you. (Groans) I'm all right. We're all going to be all right. We're stronger than we think.
