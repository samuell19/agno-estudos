THIS MOVIE IS DEDICATED TO THE FINNS IN THE WINTER WAR Try to look after Paavo. I'll try. If anyone can look after each other. Who knows, they might let us go... reach an agreement. We could have walked. -Nobody walks to war from our house. Starring Taneli M?kel? In Pekka Parikka's film THE WINTER WAR Screenplay adapted by Antti Tuuri and Pekka Parikka They promised us proper gear. -The army doesn't have any. Martti, you and Paavo only need footrags and underwear. We got those, too. -Take a pair anyway. I'd prefer a fur hat like that. Too goddamn tight. -These are all too small. They should've given me a cannon. -What for? To have a bit fun. -Wrong time for fun now. Korpela, it's your squad's turn. Okay, guys, now try to line up. I should've joined the Civil Guard. Look at the stuff they gave me. Only a cockade and a belt. Makes a man look like a fool. Here, Jussi, have a smoke. -I'm not here to learn to smoke. You can learn it in the bargain. You Hakala boys look real warlike. -That's where we're going. The radio said Moscow negotiations are going well. Not our radio. You got a radio at your place? You can listen to it anywhere. Well, old school buddy? Damn, that's my bottle. What's going on here? Russkies better watch out. Our guys are pretty wild already. Shouldn't start boozing. -What if they drank your booze? I never touch the stuff. -There go the Sippola brothers! Think we'll have to eat hardtack. -Food's not the first thing in war. Jesus! In the Civil War of 1918, when the bullets were flying - food wasn't foremost in our minds. The situation is serious. But this is not war. We are going on maneuvers. Maneuvers are something we all know very well. As for the negotiations, I know as much as you... The Russians are demanding Finnish territory. They are now discussing how big a part of Finland they want - and what right they have to claim it. They can demand all they want, - but taking it will not be easy. At ease. Let's eat before we go. Where are we going? Don't win too soon, I want my share too. Don't talk rubbish. Try to be a man here. It's good we got the harvest in. Paavo, you're the boss now with Jussi. I guess that's it. Where are you going? -To Sein?joki. Will the Russians attack? -You never know. Come on, now, don't cry. But war's coming. Russians are terrible. Who can tell for sure? -It's so awful... There's nothing to worry about. -What if they kill you? How could they kill me, of all people? It's so hard to say anything... Look after your mother. Leave it be, we'll be back soon. I've been thinking about what happened to Estonia and others. Try to save Finland from the same fate. We're not going to war. -It's just maneuvers, papa. Just remember what I told you. Well, goodbye. Here come the Sippola brothers. You homesick already, Paavo? Who was that girl crying back there? Don't you know our Anna? Good for a girl: "Anna, I wanna". -Leave him alone. Anything good in there? -I don't think so. You got my bottle? -We drank your bottle. That's my bottle. Your bottle's under the school's lavatory. I don't know about them Russians demands - but I guess it's land they want. Half a county in Karelia, islands, and the Hanko peninsula. Kind of voracious, aren't they. Nothing's enough for them. Don't they have enough land already. All the way to Siberia. They better leave our lands alone. The only land we'll give them is their burial plot. Have a drink, Pentti. -Never been greedy for the stuff. Paavo, what are you sighing? Leaving's hard for a single man... gets homesick. Me, I thank my luck for getting away. We must get a field kitchen. I won't steal it. Over and out. They say we've received one. -Where can it be? I haven't seen one. -Did it turn into an airplane? Can I ask something? Go ahead. Can Paavo and I be in the same squad? I promised to look after him. I guess it's OK. -I don't know if I can, though... Rinta, is younger Hakala in 3rd squad? -Yeah, that's right. What about Martti? -He's in 1st. Put Paavo in 1st, too. What's the difference? -Makes a difference to me. So who do we take out? -I don't know. Just keep your papers in order. Well, boys, what's your battle plan? Sir, we shoot if they start coming. Every man has his own shooting sector, Colonel, Sir. How are you Kauhava boys feeling? -Just waiting for war, Sir. Aren't we old pals with Hakala.... from the M?nts?l? uprising. I think we met there, too. Bigger things are in store this time. -What sort of things? Let's wait and see. You think they put Erkkil? in the same squad to get at us. -I guess so. They say he's our half-brother.... his mother was our maid. I suppose it's definite. Well, you said brothers can help each other in a bad spot. They were harping on it in school. Sweden will help us if Russia attacks. -I don't believe it. Who says that? -Somebody heard it on the radio. What help would the Swedes be? The Russkies won't attack if they know the Swedes are on our side. The Russkies don't dread Swedes. I'd visit home, if I knew we had time. Paasikivi is back from Moscow. -Only to get further instructions. Anyway, he's back. A quick trip home.... I wonder. -No use asking me. I'll come and be your son in-law. -I've got no daughters. Hello, Rajala. -Hello? Don't you know how to salute? Let's take it again. Are you serious? -Let's try it. Do it again. Do it yourself. The Russians say they want to secure Leningrad - and that's why they want the land. They don't trust us. But we don't trust them, either. So it's reciprocal. Eat, boys, eat. Come and help me, boys. -Us? Help me with something. -With what? The women said they have something for us. Let's go get it. Hey, where are you taking it? -We're taking what's ours. This is not yours. Sergeant, how do you talk to your superiors. Fuck you, Jutila, you won't take our kitchen. Martti, go get a horse. What do you think you're doing? -Taking away our kitchen. How do you know it's yours? -It says so in the papers. Can I see the papers? This is the number of our kitchen, the same number as this one. It's a bit unclear, the number. -Yes, I noticed it when I got it. It took a while to find it. Don't they know a dead body without dog tags. What if a grenade takes your head off? -The tags go with it. Or if a bullet hits you in the face, so bad your pals don't recognize you? You wouldn't be any worse off. -Don't talk rot, this is regulations. Finest thing I ever had round my neck. -Or will have. I guess this means we're going, as they give out death tags. Now, come on, men. Jussi, take a good look at my dog tags - ...in case they shoot my head off. I'll know you, Ylli. How, if I don't have a head? -By the smell. And lead us not in to temptation, but deliver us from evil. For Thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory. Amen. May the Lord be with you. Jesus says; come, for everything is made ready. The body of Our Lord, Jesus Christ. The blood of Our Lord, Jesus Christ. In fields cleared from forests deep A nation lives, brave and free The vow they made sacred and true Gone is slavery, or go we will, too Like our fathers have gone before us Dying for freedom is pure and true Boys from Ylih?rm? can sing! -Silence in the line! Why aren't we singing? -Singing's by separate orders only. Somppi, where are they taking us? -I have no idea. Ask, you are an officer. We're headed south. But nobody on this train knows where we're going. The engineer should know. -Go ask him. We can go to Kivennapa, for all I care. -That's possible, too. The radio says that Paasikivi is going back to Moscow. It's time he raised some hell for the Russkies. He's a bit too old for that. He'll find it easier to negotiate, knowing we're on our way... Russkies will soon know the Finns mean a real thing. Get some sleep. Can't bear to sleep, corporal. Heroic deeds await us. This is the turning point. We can go either east or south. Or we can stay here. -I won't stay here. Boys, come in. You can't leave the train! Arvi, come on! A man can still take a leak. Nobody from our squad is there, are they? Boys, come in here. Matti also. Come back safe! Well, here we come, the enemy! -But where? Who cares? Away from home, anyway. Or does Paavo miss his mother? We didn't fight because of wrath But the glorious memories took us Our national heroes And songs of our fathers' Shut up, you youth club boys. -I'm not one of them. You don't learn this at a worker's club. What's wrong with youth club? -You should know. The sons of the heroic folk Can't lick their chains They want to rise from the forests And die on the fields of glory Don't make a fire here, the enemy sees it from the air. I'm going to make some coffee. -What enemy? Making a fire is strictly forbidden. -Just stop whooping. Might be better not to light a fire. You boys know nothing about art of war. First thing you do is build a fire. That's most important thing in war. Officers might not like it. -Is that what you're scared of? I'm not scared of anything. -Be afraid when you hear guns. Don't be scared of officers, or a little fire. I've been there. I see you boys have a fire going. -Thought we might brew some coffee. Good idea. We may have to march all night to the border. Yes, Ylli, here we go again... like last time. Like in the Civil War. -This might be a little different. Where are they taking us? -To the butchers. Keep on walking, boys. -You'll learn this soon: In the war you never know, you just go where they tell you. District Chief, let me try how it feels to ride that horse. Try to learn to call me lieutenant. Lieutenant, sir, may I ride on your horse? -Go ahead. My feet are killing me. -Should've taken the old boots. I thought I'd look better in new ones. This is a mean place to sit if they start shooting at you. That's what I think. -You fall like a pheasant from a tree. Should we sing a fine song? -We can pass the time without. Let the Ylih?rm? boys sing. We're looking for war glory. Alert! Alert! Don't blow that whistle again as long as we're here. Thank you for a fine ride. Your horses aren't used to ships, I see. This is the first time I've seen a ship on a river. Where are you boys from? -From Ostrobothnia. Weren't you lucky to get here! I'd rather be home. -Come on, now! Come with us to K?kisalmi! You won't miss your home there! Funny kind of milk cart you have. How about your milk? -We take it along the road. Funny to see the whole army running because of a ship whistle. What's this quiet little girl's name? It's Aino. -Well Aino, coming home? I see. Aino is a bit shy, is she? -She misses her fiance. Where is he? Run off with another? Our men went to Rautu to fortify the border. Paavo, let's go brew some coffee. Scarves from Paris, pure silk. Come'n buy one for your sweetheart. As you were. -Want some coffee? I just had some. -Suit yourself, then. The regiment has decided not to draw the first pay - but to leave it to the Army. We've all seen the condition of our supplies and tools. The Army would buy guns and such. What do you think? Has everybody decided? -Yes, that's what I hear. I'm in. That's all right. Where are you going? -To look around. Careful, or they'll shoot you as a spy. Paavo is spying into the morale of civilians. Don't go without your weapon. -He sure has one. This is a man's thing to do. We bought stone drills with our own money - since the regiment didn't have any. It was for a good cause. I thought our ploughman might be hungry. Soil should be turned before winter. My husband didn't have time. He had to go off to Rautu. I like doing it. Helps pass the time. I don't know how to pay you. -Don't need payment. I got enough land to know what it means to turn the soil. You spoiled your Sunday. -Not much else to do on a Sunday. We were just talking. -About our Fatherland? Come and sit down. -I'd better not. Just for a little while. My fianc is building fortifications. I can't do this to him. I'm good enough to go to war and die, but not good enough to sit next to. We might leave tomorrow. Come and sit down. I can't stand here all night. My legs are going numb. Anybody home? Evening, I hope I'm not disturbing. -No, no... not at all. I just wanted to ask if you still had those pies to sell. Or some bread... Seems to me like the pie-sharing happened already. No, no... wait, I'll get some. Maybe I could warm these a little. -They're OK like they are. Martti's not too fussy. How much are they? -Let's say they're for plowing the field. You're quite a pussy chaser. -You wanted some, too. I'm a married man. -What am I? You know best. -We just listened to the radio and... What did they say? Paasikivi returned from Moscow... didn't agree to anything... Russkies better be careful with their demands... We might have a say about it, too. Quite a patriotic moment. That's what I said. Lapua boys told me that America promised - to help us if Russia attacks. That'd be a good thing. -It's too far for them to come. Wouldn't take long by ship. -It's not so quick. I've been to America. If Russkie attacks, we don't need any America. We only need Laurila's Regiment. -Laurila told not to spread rumors. This is no rumor. Lapua boys heard it on the radio. I heard that Sweden won't let anybody march through their territory. The horsemen said so at Battalion. Hakala here ploughed our fields. -Thank you for that. No need. I wanted to make myself useful. Well, I thank you anyway. -They've all been so helpful. I find this Army way insane. We went to Rautu and you've been here. There is no sense in this. I would prefer to stay home. Write your address, when you know. I'll write to you. I'll write. And remember. You have girls crying after you here and there. It's the common cause. The country needs new soldiers. -Look who's talking. Half platoon! Alert Half platoon! It's the Russians now. They're trying to kill you. Bear that in mind. Take your positions! Find your own sector and wait for the command. Don't shoot on your own. Isn't Ylli part of this maneuver? I've practiced so much, I'm waiting for the real thing. You boys practice as much as you want. I thought you went on leave. -As you see. I thought you'd get leave for your own baby's christening. They didn't let me go... Asked me what I should do there, now that the baby is already born. Shut up! News! The Soviet Union has been forced to cancel the treaty of non-aggression. The sergeant-major got ten days. -How did he wrangle that? His wife died. Paavo, wouldn't a leave be nice, now that the skirts have gone... We might as well head off somewhere. How come you're back so soon? When I got to the station they told me all leave was cancelled. You don't say. Russians crossed the border at Mets?pirtti and Rautu six o'clock. It's the real thing now. Should I wake the boys? -That's the orders. Good morning, men from the Ostrobothnia. Good morning, Colonel. Eyes front! Order arms! At ease! Like so many times in the past - the men of Finland must once more take up arms - as our old enemy, Russia, tries to invade our country. We did not want war. We did want peace. But peace is not what we got from Stalin... or from Otto Ville Kuusinen whom we threw out of this country back in 1918. The Army has shown to the Russians that this is no parade march. And now, on our independence day, it is our turn. Not an inch will we yield! Three cheers for the Fatherland, for the Finnish army - and Commander- in-Chief Mannerheim! Ylli get down, they're firing at us! If it whines, it always misses. If it's for you, it just whispers. Follow me, if we have to go. Must be nasty in the front lines. Sure don't feel like going our there with an empty stomach. Where is Somppi? -Over there. We have to prepare for a counterstrike. It's coming soon! Don't all stand together. Spread out! This is no kids' game. Ylli went in one go. How did he get it? -Shrapnel through the back of the head. When it's for you, it just whispers... He didn't hear machine guns sing in this war. Did Ylli get hit? Did you sleep at all? -I just woke up. Should we build a fire? -It's forbidden. We'll freeze to death. -Many ways to die in the war. I've been thinking about the Alanen family - with Ylli coming home in a casket. His wife is our kin. -Ylli was my second cousin. Anybody hit? I don't think so. What did they tell you? -Changeover tonight. You stay here, Paavo. What do I do? -Just shoot it they start coming. Is this tough? -Aren't you the tough clan? I mean, is this a bad spot? Nothing but bad spots here, pal. You got grease in your rifle breech? It's well greased. -Wipe it dry. Should be a field there, and the river behind it. Russians got across the river yesterday. P?rssinen forest on the left. Boys from Central Finland say the Russians start early, like work. Must be warming up their tank engines. They're Russians. Shouldn't we shoot them? Don't ask me. Why don't our guns fire? -Has anybody told them? Surely they can see. It was about time. Jesus, that's no good. We are damn short of ammunition. The Russkies are coming! Are you hit? -No, just hot. Martti, there are too many of them coming. Why aren't the anti-tank men firing? -They're bringing the gun. Soon it'll be too late. All the phone lines are down, I sent a man. Take Ahti's rifle, he won't be needing it. Was Ahti hit bad? -Already dead at the first aid post. Who, Ahti? Are they going to kill all our pals? Are they coming at night? -Who knows? Have you stayed awake? -There's enough noise. Martti, come with me. Let's see if the neighbors had any papers with them. What papers? Let's search the pockets of the dead. They won't come over now? You won't get shot? Go through their pockets. Let's go. You won't need this. It is gets any colder, we'll need dynamite to break up the cheese. Let Russian artillery do it for us. Hell of a stink here. -My hands are covered in blood. Are you wounded? -No, it's the Russian I robbed. The Russians stopped when we pointed the gun at them. Don't brag now, they can come with force. Damnit, boys, Russians are coming! They're already in the trench. In the trench? How did they get there? Dug their way last night. -Are there many of them? Haven't counted them yet. We have to drive them out or kill them right there. I'll go first and clear the trench. Paavo, you throw grenades. Fix bayonets. Let's give the, boys! How did you such a blunt bayonet through a jacket? I just shoved it and stabbed for my brother. Take the breeches from enemy rifles. They won't jam as easy. Here they come... take your positions. 1st Platoon, get to the edge of the world, one by one. Do I still have legs? -One. 1st Squad form a chain! Paavo don't! Are you hit bad? -Just lifted my hand... Where did it hit? -It scratched at once. Did you get it in the head? -No, just my side, I think. Jussi! Come and take a look at Paavo! I wasn't hit in the head. -Let's bandage it. You'll get home leave. Soon I can't even see anything. -Think you can walk? Nothing wrong with my legs. Soon as I lifted my arm it scratched my side. They can't use explosive bullets! -Go tell them. I've got the battalion commander's written orders. About what? We would've known that anyway. You stay here, I'll go to the company. Did they order you there? -Told me to drive the Russians back. I'm going to ask with what. All right boys, let's take back our positions. Try to take a few prisoners. Aatos and Erkkil?, grab hand grenades. 1st Platoon, prepare to counterattack. Look out! Why did he do that? They've been told that we'll torture and kill them. We need more men to dig the trenches open. I've already ordered reserves to counterattack. What were our losses? -Four dead and six wounded. I wonder how long they'll try coming straight at us, standing up? It's a permanent regulation for them... They can't change it in a hurry... Well, Hakala, how do you like war as job? The younger Hakala was wounded today. Badly hit? -No. Just a scratch in the side. A man won't die by a scratch. It's our turn for sentry duty. So watch who you shoot at. -My bullets are for the Russians. Hey guys, are you asleep? Asleep? Us? Sure looked like it. -We weren't sleeping. Go get some sleep in the dugout. Were we asleep? All I can hear is the boys digging and the Russians tanks. I heard them here already. -Let's hope that's all we hear. Don't shoot, they're from 5th Company. -What are they doing there? Attacking the woods behind the school. What's the matter with you? You'll get yourself killed. Don't go... stay down.... They'll kill you! Password! Pussy.... pussy. It's hungry. Pussy, pussy. I wonder whose cat that is? -It stayed behind. A cat does that, even if the people leave. Cats grow fond of places, not people. You're the cat expert here. What do you mean? -You've stroked some pussy on this trip. Boys are just talking... jealous. I hope Erkkil? didn't run the wrong way. -The Russians can have taken him. This man was found at battalion headquarters. Did you get that far? -He told that all of you have been killed. Well, we have some still alive. Sit down. Come on, now. -They talked about a court- martial. I told Erkkil? will come to his senses when he's back with his own folk. Jussi, do you have any medicine for Erkkil?? Of course. This will help you. I see you have yourselves a pet. Every house needs a cat. -No rats can pester us. Some men from the Lieska battalion will open the trenches tonight. Try and get some sleep here. Erkkil?, too. -Yes, sir. You hold on to this cat. She purrs so nicely. What did you give him? I have nothing but headache pills. Erkkil?! Come lie down beside me. My brothers told me after the Civil War - that it's an accident to get hit by artillery. Even though the Reds got one jaeger. In war the thing is machine guns. Hard to say. Well, tell me what's the war like. None of us will come back alive. That I don't believe. We got definite information that our boy Matti - killed thirty Russkies with his knife on the very first day. I haven't heard about it. -Funny, it's supposed to be definite. Russkies aren't within knife's reach. You quite sure? -Sure I'm sure. I don't believe you.... why should they tell me if it wasn't definite? I wouldn't know. They're afraid to talk about it... It gives a bad picture of Finnish soldiers - if the world hears they're killing with knives... That might well be. Let's just hope he comes home safely. The boys will have a cold ride. I suppose they don't freeze. Give me one, too. Buy your own, then you'll know how far your money goes. Oh Jesus Christ have mercy Once I must depart But when and in what way You only know It is withheld from me But for you it's clear You counted the days of my life In you Jesus My soul is praised here You give me your rest When the body weakens and dies Your young precious blood... Can you stay close to our Matti? The Russians can't harm him. It's not like you think over there. What's it like, then? It's like... can't explain. It's time Paavo started heading home. Mother don't... Who knows when we'll meet again. I've always been good enough for leaving. They're doing the same everywhere.... Trying to dig their way in close. Take extra care, now. Some of them pretended to attack while the others were digging, Sir. Have you found that Matti Ylinen yet? No, Sir. Russians have taken him. I guess that's what happened. I promised his father to look after him. Well, boys. It's Stalin's birthday today. Be extra careful tonight. It's Stalin's birthday. They're trying hard today. They're planning for a birthday present - that'll crush the White bandits. Be prepared for that. They seem to have women there. -And they're drinking. How do you know that? They're singing. -And having fun with women. It's a birthday party. Should we ask our artillery to deliver a greeting? Leave it be. Makes them nervous. We'll have peace and quiet. Regards from home. Back already? -A weeks leave only lasts seven days. How are things back home...? They sent a parcel... and a letter. Now we got a well rested sentry for tonight. Boys are all falling asleep on their feet. Paavo's been awake every night at home... He slept on the train. Right, Paavo? I can do a night's guard duty. -I haven't got men left... Where did that cat go? Paavo should've seen it. What cat? - We had a cat... Guess it's run away. No animal could live in that smell. -You must have been dreaming. Will you be okay out there? -Come and watch if you don't believe. Nature's calling. I'll go release Paavo. It must be much fresher there. Keep an eye on the Russians during the night - so they can't dig their way into the trenches. Laurila told us they've tried that everywhere lately. We'll be going, too. They've got - cartloads of Christmas presents at the company. I thought we'd deal them out tomorrow, as it's Christmas Eve. So try and be nice, so you'll get presents. But not too nice, not to our neighbor. Shoot them! Paavo, was there anything? Nothing unusual, except them singing, Sir. How was home? -All's well. How's the scar healing? -Itching a bit. It sure burned you enough - so that you'll want to show the Russians. -Yes, sir. All you need to do is light this match. Then throw it so it breaks over the tank's engine. Came from a distillery. How would a Molotov cocktail taste? It's just gasoline. Aren't there some spirits too? -And tar of course. Just make sure your matches are dry... or it won't light. Are these any good against tanks? They've destroyed dozens of tanks. Our new secret weapon, okayed by Mannerheim. Because they can't give us anything better. Wake up, boys... It's your turn on guard duty. -I've just been... Go along anyway Paavo... I got nobody else to put there. Down... stay down! Boys, somebody else take this guard duty. I can take this turn... Martti, you better go to dugout. Alert... take positions! Pass the order. Hello...hello... Attention, damnit, hello. Martti, the lines are down. The company should know that the Russians are coming in force. Go tell them I don't have any men and the Russians are coming. Over and out. They're not all coming to your sector. They're trying at several points, it's their regulation. I will be there shortly myself. We'll see where the Russians are strongest. Tell Kantola to try and hold on. Well... I'll tell them. Luoma, try if you can cover their sector. If you can't handle it alone, I'll bring more men. Tell that. He told he'll come over soon. Did he promise more men? -Yes... No. If we need them. Didn't you tell him we need more men? He's coming himself. Can you take your place now? -Why not. Our lines are getting so thin the Russians can walk through. Why isn't our artillery firing? The Swedes sold us a bit too big shells. There's fifty Russkies per man. Take Paavo's gun. That was bad. Where are you taking me? Who are you, boys? -It's Jussi. Who else? I can't see. -You'll be taken care of. Don't fire till I tell you to. Aim for the stomach, boys. Fire! That was not our artillery. Now the Russkies gave me a Christmas present. That was too many Russkies for us alone anyway. Did the boss say he was coming? -Yes. Where's he taken to? I just lost my second. They took Felix away. -Was it bad? I reckon so. What are you doing here already? They're taking the boys home. I thought you might see your brother off. I promised to look after Paavo. You've seen it for yourself... Not much use looking after anybody here. The only help is from the Lord above... If He feels like it. How are you boys holding up? -It was quite a show today. Just say the word if you can't take it - and I'll try to get some replacements. Or if you can't take it. We'll handle it, right, boys? It will be very difficult for the neigbour - to come through here - as they were rude enough to shoot the commander - and many friends of us. It would be good if you can last until Boxing day. Till the exchange. Jussi, can you come here? The service company put together some cigarettes and food for you. They know how it is... It's a Christmas present. They've sent Rajala as your company commander. Laurila needs you here. And I thought you could use these. They sent them from home. My own boots are all right. I didn't have time earlier today... About Paavo... I don't know what to say... It was quite a trick from them... I'll find it ever harder to love them... from now on. Where the hell do all the lice come from? We're looking for ensign Lehtinen. In the dugout. We thought we'd like to have a sermon at Christmas. We heard you have a priest here as an ensign. I've come here to make war, and I left the priest home. There won't be any. This will be my first time in 30 years without the Lord's word at Christmas. Glory be the Lord's in Heaven, and peace on Earth - among men. As the angels had gone to heaven, the shepherds said to one another: Let us now go unto Bethlehem and see this thing - which came to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us. They went in haste and found Mary and Joseph - and the babe lying in a manger. Let the Russians hear us singing the Christmas psalm. They'll come straight across, running behind the tanks. Don't get nervous, just wait. Aim at the belly and shoot. The tanks stop at the obstacles, they don't come further. We've burned them with Molotov cocktails and anti-tank guns. I was here early December, afraid for my life. I thought you'd just arrived. We just rested for ten days. One more thing... We've decided not to let go very easily. We've lost so many friends here. We lost them, too. Thought I'd tell you that. Did I lose my eye? Someone had counted 378 airplanes during one surveillance duty. Ours or the enemy's? The regiment ought to declare a competition - where the first one to spot a Finnish plane wins the first prize. I don't know about that. But someone ought to do something about the lice. Boy, it's cold. -I'm getting hungry. Attention! Listen, everybody! Let's go to the dugout. -Is it something special? Yes. How could one put an end to that plinking for a while? With a grenade. All sorts of foolishness! Come Aatos, you'll be in a book -What book? Somebody will make one out of this. Heroes of the Finnish War. You'll be one of them. -I won't come! Unshaven and all... Come on. Help me, guys! Makes you feel so foolish... That took care of the strumming for a while, guys. That shrapnel had your number on it. And Marjatta said she's got two letters from you - here's her answer. A parcel for Aatos Laitila. Why won't anybody write to me? You're such a bad person. They don't know it there. -Maybe the word's got out. You better sleep too, Mauri. -What if the Russians come? They'll wake you up. He's not coming now. Just trying to scare us. It's a mean noise. -Take my gloves, I don't need them. Finnish soldiers! The capitalist exploiters are turning into gold the blood of soldiers - and the tears of your mothers and wives. Wipe the capitalists and their officers out of Finland. Come with your weapons to the Russian side. I'll go have a little wipe. Soldiers' blood... mothers' tears. What are you guys doing? We had to leave the bunker. -Why is that? Water started pouring in from somewhere. We couldn't stay there... Cold like this and water getting in our boots... Did you all come back? -Of course. You should've at least left a guard. -Who'd be going there at night? Send a couple of men to guard it... -Yes, Sir. Carry on... Did you take the men out of the bunker last night? Yes Captain, Sir. -Who gave you permission? Water started pouring in, so men couldn't stay there. Boys don't have decent boots here, Captain, Sir. Do you realize that the Russians took the bunker last night? Did you post a guard there? -Yeah, the boys went there. Sir, we have sentries there. Your sentries started running as soon as they heard the Russians coming... They ran all the way to Regiment. We got a call from there. Potila, order 5th Company to take the bunker back from the Russkies. Yes, Sir. They have men who won't run to HQ - every time they hear a few Russian felt boots swishing in the snow. It's our own artillery. The Russkies will soon run. That's just tickling. -We still have to go in. Give supporting fire! Now Finns are dying out there because of you. Fuck you, you gave that away! No sense in trying to go there in the daylight! Don't let anyone come through. -How? Try shooting them. He's in a mean mood. -Dressed down by the commander. Are you sure there's someone there? -Yes there is. Why aren't they shooting? -Go ask them! They've blocked all openings. Hands up, Russian soldiers! We've been shouting it at them. If someone could speak Russian. Send someone to take an order to the casemate. Martti, you go. -What's so important? That I must go in there? -What's it to you? It is, if I take the message. When I order you to go, you go - even if I only want to say hello to their commander. Martti, go now. What do I tell them? -Damn it, tell them this: Say: 'Hello!' Nobody can go there! Keep down, Martti! Where are you going in this foul weather? Where's your company commander? -There. What are you doing? Learning to lie in grave. Lieutenant, Sir. -Yes? Our new company commander told me to come and say Hello. Fire... don't let them get away. Strange, that Russian getting away with a company firing at him. Perhaps he earned his life. I dunno! Shit! -Stay still! The casemate boys said - the Russians are coming in force. I haven't seen anything. -They're the ones seeing things. Go and relieve the 5th company. They're so tired they keep seeing Russians. I'd like to know one thing. -Yes? But I won't. Who will go? -1st and 2nd squad. Our boys are all tired. -Martti, you know the way. Shall I say hello again? Looks very bad here. -Is that a fact? We're to take your positions. Where are your officers? Dead, every last one. You must have someone in charge. -They haven't told me. Where's your platoon leader? -Over there. Five minutes, then we blow the bunker. Soldiers of the Soviet Union! Surrender and come out of the bunker - hands up and without your weapons. We will blow up the bunker in five minutes. Will they really blow it up? -Looks like it. I just wanted to know what's so important about that bunker? Arvi, go tell Battalion the next people in the bunker will be archaeologists. I wonder if anybody's still in there? Are we going look at that heap of gravel forever? I haven't eaten a thing in two days. -Better wait for orders to leave... Jussi, don't go! It's all over for Arvi... No, hell... can't be... Martti, can you take Arvi's stuff and send it to his home? Why not... - We're going to rest in a place called Yl?j?rvi. There's postal services there. Martti, wake up. Wake up! Martti! Wake up? Is it alarm? -Quiet, let's not wake up the others. We could heat up the sauna. Can you do it? Can't you find a kitchen man to do it? Go now, they're all busy. And you've slept a while. -Why me? You were right by the door. -You're hounding me. I only asked you to heat the sauna. I can do it. The word is, if anybody's got a good reason to visit home - you can get leave. -Home? Where's that? I'd say where you left it. How far is it to the Taipale River? -I heard it's about forty kilometers. Make way for women and children coming! Here pal, have a drink! I don't touch the stuff. What kind of man are you? No man at all. Take it, when the heroes of Taipale River are offering it. The heroes of Taipale are all dead. I tried to get leave for the funeral... but all leave was cancelled. I just want to know how he went... Did Paavo have to suffer? I don't think so... it was real quick. A riffle bullet clean through the heart. He was in the trench in front of me when they got him... I was there right away... He was quiet, died instantly. They wouldn't let us open the coffin. -That's the custom, isn't it? One of the pallbearers said that... When they came down the church steps with Paavo's coffin - there were like pieces rolling around. Jussi, you were a pallbearer too? -Of course I was. Did you hear anything? -I don't know... I had the front part. How's little Paavo? A bit shy, it's been a long time. Your mother said she'd take little Paavo into her bed for the night. She said we can 'talk' in peace, with the boy no listening. Come and 'talk', then... Paavo said when he left that none of you would come back alive. Don't think about that now. I won't let you go... won't let you... When did you last see him? I didn't see him that night. We weren't in the same squad. How can a man disappear without a trace? They were in hand-to-hand combat that night. It's such a chaos in the dark. -But they told us first - that our Matti had killed 30 Russians with his knife. And now they don't know where he is. -Perhaps he was taken prisoner. That's what grieves mother. When he was reported missing... Not knowing whether he's dead or prisoner somewhere. She keeps dreaming about him. Matti is lying in blood, wounded, moaning and calling for his mother. And then he's alive, not fighting. Maybe a prisoner. I can't tell you more. -It was easier for you, with Paavo. At least it's clear. -I don't know about that. Lucky it's so cold. It helps the Finns. Yes, King Winter is on our side. It's cold for the Finns too, wet clothes and -40 degrees. But not as cold as the Russians. Greetings to just about everybody. Well, you came back soon. -Missed you too much. Did you bring any food? The Army is taking good care of its boys, bus rides and all. They're in a hurry to take us into a tight spot. A free ride and you're suspicious. -I hope the fare is not our lives. That's a cheap fare. They say we'll go to the Mannerheim Line - to shoot at the Russians from war casemates and chairs. No need to go outside. Martti, do you have a smoke for me? -You're too young to smoke. Take this. -We're going to die as heroes, freezing in a bus. There's a story to tell your grandchildren. 4th Company prepare to cross to ?yr?p?? ridge. Combat gear, leave your rucksacks here. Of course the food stays back here. How do you get food there? Our task is to ambush the Russkies if they try to cross the river. A lot of them coming? -A lot. We might get overrun. Laurila wants to surprise them on that slope. It the Russkies cross the river, the entire Taipale front can be cut off. We might be cut off ourselves. They're coming over the river. Fire! Rajala promised us damn food, not thanks. Put a fire up his ass, Pentti! Well I'll be... they got my gun. I have to take a new one from the Russkies. Come away, boys! Martti? Go there. Is anyone left there? Nobody who speaks Finnish. -They won't come through here. They're covering for their own attack to the river. I thought you bought it. -So did I. One of the hit me with his gun. Was it bad? -He hit me. He should have shot. I killed him. Martti, don't go to sleep... You'll freeze to death. -Cut it off. Try to stay awake... they might come. -Who's they? Well, same ones who've been coming at us lately. Oh, yeah. We can't let them get to the river... That would be the end of the whole Regiment... Let's try and take back those positions, boys. I know you're tired, but we have to try. The Russians won't believe us without enough guns in the air. They're coming at us again! Somppi, get down! Somppi! You'll get yourself killed! Who is it? -Hakala. Paavo or Martti? -Martti. Paavo was blown into pieces at Taipale. That's right. Go to the Battalion HQ and tell them that the Russians are in positions - and we can't flush them out, at least not until the morning. Tell Sihvo that... That he could send a few men to help us. Sure, I can go. I've sent three runners, none of them came back. Try and stay alive at least until there. The password is ?yr?p??n ?rjy. -I remember. Halt! Who's coming? ?yr?p??n ?rjy. I need to go to the Battalion HQ. It's right there near the river. We'll put them there. I have a message to the Battalion commander. I'll take it. -From the commander of 4th company. We have the Russians in our positions. We'll drive them out - but we need more men. -Thank you. We have to keep these lines. Rajala needs more men. The Russians are in their trenches. Yes, but I don't have any men. Even the service troops are there. Take this and chew on it. What is it? -Coffee beans. I don't have anything else to give. Don't shoot at one man! Nobody else here! Who is it? -Erkkil?. Is it bad? -It's real bad. Son of God... Son of God. Just keep calm... Nothing wrong with you. Who is it? -Martti. Who are you guys? Keep calm now... We'll leave soon. You'll get well. That's it, then... Jussi... are you hit bad? Not too bad, I guess. No pain... I don't know... Your guts are showing. Must be shock then. I feel sort of numb. Someone hit here? That other one's lifeless... This one has some life in him. Let's lift him in... There might be horses at Battalion. 2nd Battalion has to hold this side. If they get across the Vuoksi, it'll be the end of the Regiment. The front will be cut off. I'm asking you now: Can you hold your positions? I have asked every company the same question. There are not many of you. I guess we can, if it doesn't get any worse. Long as anyone's left to fight. They told me to bring word... Nurmo boys will attack in the morning and take the church hill... We have to hold the ones here so they can't go and help. Help the Nurmo boys? -No, the Russkies. I see... yeah... Why don't the Nurmo boys attack? -I don't understand. Don't go now! The attack is badly delayed! Cover them! Fire! They'll kill them all! Now they intend to come through here. They keep coming no matter how we shoot. They're full of vodka. -I wouldn't mind some. I guess we'll fall back. Just a little bit. Martti, go along with Rajala. Where to? Russians have crossed over to the Vuosalmi side. What are we supposed to do? -Go with the boys from 1st Battalion... And Mauri and Korpela, too. They'll explain. Hurry along. I don't have a single piece of bread. Take a coffee bean and chew on it. The whole bean? Must be hundreds of bodies. -Keep quiet. Will they ever run out of men? They're getting fewer, though. Some prisoners said they've brought in two fresh divisions. That's 40 000 men! -More or less. No wonder their attack looked inexperienced. Stay down, Mauri. Martti, let's try once more. Looks like we've scraped the bottom of the barrel. Was it the Sergeant-Major? Always without his helmet. Asking for it. Forward... Mustn't stay here... Let's kick them all the way to Leningrad! Forward! Don't stay here! Shut the hell up, how're we supposed to help, too... You didn't have to... Like shooting a ram between the horns... Where are the boys? -Russkies shot them. Is this the day they break through? -Might well be. Then it's the last day of this life. Might be that, too. Peace has come at 11:00 o'clock.
