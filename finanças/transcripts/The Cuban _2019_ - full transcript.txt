Okay, that's good. Now support him, okay? That's right. All right, let's go. You're okay. Oh, shit. Good night. Good night, Amma. How are you doing today, Mr. Garcia? It's me, Nurse Baker. This is Ms. Ayoub. You're gonna be spending a lot of time together. There you go. Good job. You can have some water, 'kay? That's good. That's good. All right. - Come on, Ms. Ayoub. - Coming. What's wrong with him? Uh, vascular dementia and Alzheimer's. Haven't had much of a glimmer out of that one in a while. I... see he likes jazz. - Hmm? - The poster. Oh, yeah, he brought that with him. What are his medications for? Blood pressure, mostly. Alprazolam for anxiety and clozapine, of course. What's that? It's an antipsychotic. Mr. Garcia doesn't eat much with the other residents anymore. He gets agitated. It'll be your job to feed him. You think you can handle that? Absolutely. Bedpan needs changing in the Forest Room. Name? Mina Ayoub. Well, that's nice. I meant the resident. Luis Garcia. Ah, right. Good luck with that. Hello, Mr. Garcia. I know it's not exactly gourmet, but you need to eat, okay? Here. So, um, how long have you been living here? You like Benny Moré. My grandfather used to play his music for me when I was a kid... back home. My grandfather was a musician and my grandmother was a singer. He actually taught at the University of Kabul... traditional music. But he loved jazz, especially Cuban jazz. He had these records that a visiting professor from New York brought. It was back in the '60s, when Cuban jazz was all the rage. He'd play these records and... we'd dance. Mr. Garcia. You haven't eaten anything. You need to eat. Guess you don't want any. Hello. Mina. Yeah? I have a headache. Turn that off, please. Sorry, Amma. Amma-jan, I have a question about one of the residents. I'm an administrator, Mina. But you're also a doctor. I was a doctor. They give him an antipsychotic. Is that normal? - Does he have dementia? - Mm-hmm. Then, yes, that's normal. That's it? Yes. - One could say they're overused. - Hmm. May I ask which resident you're talking about? Luis Garcia. He's in the Sunshine Room. Oh, yeah, I know the one. Hmm. So, is he dangerous or something? Nah, I don't think so. The drug just makes him more predictable, especially if he's prone to outbursts. But... maybe he's just trapped inside his own mind and doesn't know where the hell he is. You're presuming he has the awareness to understand that. Hello, Mr. Garcia. It's Mina, again. Mr. Garcia. Elena. No, no. I'm... I'm Mina. Remember? Who's Elena? Ah... Elena. No, no, no, no. No, no. Please calm down. It's okay. No, no, no. Calm down, Mr.... Luis, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay, don't worry. It's okay. Your cousin is liberated... no mosque, no husband. It was the mosque that brought us here in the first place. You're so dramatic. Atesh-jan, let it go. Leave my cousin alone. - How was your visit to Kabul? - Excellent. Good. I had a chance to visit your family property. And I have to say, it's all well. But there's no... there's no one to take care it. Mm. Atesh-jan. Let me sell it for you. It's a good idea. You know it's just a matter of time before they take it away. And I can get you a good deal. You can invest it here. Buy a condo. And where did you find out about this deal? I made an inquiry at the mosque. The mullah will introduce me to a potential buyer in Afghanistan. I appreciate your concern, but I don't think it's the right time. Is that Ethan? He's the one you met in drama club? Yeah, he's so cute. Oh, how old is he? Grad school. Atesh-jan, how is the restaurant? - It's great. - Mm. In fact, we're getting ready for expansion. Already? It's all been arranged. So soon. Sugar? We're still on, right? Saturday night? I don't know. I mean, I have so much work to catch up on. - I don't... - No, no, no. Please, please don't do this to me. This is, like, the only way I get to see him off-campus. Please, come on! Okay. Yes. Thank you. - Come again, okay? - Bano-jan, just let me know if you change your opinion about the property. Thank you, Atesh-jan. Thank you. I'll let you know. Why does he always want to take control? Maybe he's just trying to help. I don't need help. And what makes him think he's so devout? Using Friday prayers as an excuse to make business arrangements. Who does he think he is? Are they still watching? Oh, yeah. I told them we'd grab a coffee later. So your dad thinks this is part of the drama program. Drama program, yeah. You're so awesome. Thanks for doing this again. Hey, hey. Hey. Hi. Ethan, Kris, this is my cousin, Mina. - Hi, Mina. - Hi. I'm Kris. Nice to meet you. - So, uh, we should probably go get ready, yeah? - Yeah. - Nice meeting you. - Okay. Enjoy the show, all right? - Bye! - Break a leg. - Have fun! - See you later. Um, so we should probably head in, yeah? Okay. Do you remember this? Yes. Mona, they played this at our wedding! That was 60 years ago, but I remember it like it was yesterday. We danced all night. Do you remember? Francis? - Francis. - Such a beautiful night. Yes... Francis! I want a divorce. I thought it was kind of funny, right? You, too. Well, yeah, sure, but, essentially, it was a tragedy. Comedy ends in a wedding, and tragedy ends in death. Yeah, well, according to Rumi, our death is our wedding with eternity, so it was still a comedy. Rumi, the Persian poet. Afghan, actually. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Who's that? It's just my dad. Oh, you should've invited him. You're kidding, right? No. I mean, Zahra, you told me that he loves the theatre, and it might be nice to meet my girlfriend's father at some point. Yeah, eventually. Great. When? I don't know. Don't put me on the spot. Well, I'm, like, free. Available. Well, first, my dad's gotta get used to the fact that I'm not eating meat anymore. He's gonna know that that was all your fault. - Well... - Oh, my Go... Did this killjoy make you watch that egregious animal-cruelty documentary? I'll never eat chicken again. It's pure shock value. Have you lost all of your morals? Okay, Mina, where do you stand on this issue? Well, I'm Afghan, so... - So am I. - Well, you can't use your culture as an excuse! Leave her alone. You don't have to answer that. Well, no, it's for the greater good of the planet. 'Kay, leave us meat-eaters alone. Okay? Um, I, I'm actually... vegetarian. He's still a hippie. Shut up. - Okay, it's getting late, Mina. Come on, we've gotta go. - What? We're in the middle of a conversation. Oh, well, just hold that thought for next time. Are... are you a student as well? She's pre-med. Come on, Mina. - Bye. - Bye. Uh, nice meeting you guys. Bye! Uh, that was awkward. I know. Um, hi, Mrs. Neil. Mrs. Neil, over here. Hi, hi. There we go. Your... your room's just down the hall, okay? Okay. Have a good day. Bye. Hello, Luis. How are you today? I have a surprise for you. I think you're gonna like this one. I knew you would know this one. Ahh... I'll be right back. ♪ Quizás, quizás ♪ I thought you might want to look nice for lunch today. Maybe you'll actually eat something. You ready? They used to love to hear me play. Oh, who? Cuba! Uh, okay. Just keep steady. Last time I did this was for my grandfather... back home. And I was a kid. Actually, I don't know why he trusted me with a razor. Aha... Whop, whop, whop. Ready? Uh-oh, uh-oh. Okay, take it easy. Ooh... 'Kay, and... there we go. Oh, uh, Mr. Garcia, sit! You need to sit down! What are you doing? Luis. Okay, Luis, yes. - ♪ Quizás, quizás, quizás ♪ - Uh... Don't overdo it. Venga. Don't push yourself. Elena... Oh, okay. Come. Easy. There you go. What... whatever happened with Elena? Oh... I said that... I was going to marry her. What stopped you? She's in New York... Things change. I couldn't go back. Come with me. What part of that did you think was a good idea? He was scruffy. You must follow our care approach, Ms. Ayoub. It's created for a reason. Mr. Garcia gets anxious. I know, but... believe me, he was fine. Listen to me, our residents come to us for three reasons: to be fed, to have someplace decent to sleep, and, most importantly, to feel safe. They need routine. He is a human being. Who deserves to live the rest of his days in peace and quiet. I respect your aunt very much, Mina, but you must get it through your head, there is no going rogue. I understand. - You ready? - Mm-mm. - Okay. - Here, Mr. Garcia. I'm not gonna hurt you. It's okay. No... No! Tom! Tom! Hey! Stop. It's okay. - Mr. Garcia. - Hey! - It's okay. - No! No! No! No! No! It's all right! We're here to help. Do you understand?! Hey, Mina? Hi. You have a class here? Yeah, just finished. You? I actually help teach a class here. I'm a T.A. Oh. Listen, I should come clean about something from the other night. Um... I eat... burgers. They're my one weakness. And I like everything on them! Onions, cheese, pickles, mushrooms, you name it. - You're a terrible vegetarian. - Yeah. I'll promise to not tell Ethan. Thank you. You wanna grab one? Burger? I mean, I'll totally understand if you don't wanna be party to my debauchery. It's... it's pretty hard to watch. Sure. Sorry about the other night. First-year biology was the worst. You took it? Yeah, it was a prerequisite, but I'm actually doing my doctoral thesis in Psych. What's it about? In a nutshell, it's about how traumatic memories affect us later in life. Oh, interesting. What about you? Was it always your dream to be a physician? Uh, I don't know if I'd call it a dream. What's the matter? Nothing. I... I just... I should be prepping for my exam. You haven't even finished your food. It's just I'm fast-tracking all my courses, so I... I really have no free time. And I... I just started this crazy new job, so... Mina, it's just a burger. Right. Does that say "Grilled Cuban Sandwich"? Hmm? Oh, yeah, the owner's Cuban. Oh. Oh, excuse me. Hi, could I get your daily special to go? Thanks. It's for a patient at the nursing home where I work. I haven't been able to get him to eat, so I figured, since he's Cuban, you know... Aren't there rules around that kinda thing, like what the patients can eat? There seem to be rules around everything. He has dementia. Vascular? Yeah, and early to mid-stage Alzheimer's. It's a very typical combination. The dementia slows the brain down to the point where our memories can't be retrieved, and then the Alzheimer's creeps in and just wipes them all away. You... know a lot about this stuff. It's kinda related to my thesis, so yes. He's been talking a lot more, though. And remembering things. Really? How come? I sing to him. No shit. Yeah. And I play music... stuff that he relates to. I... I... I was just reading about this. Um, music stimulates the dorsolateral frontal cortex, right? Yeah, exactly. From what I understand, this kind of brain study's pretty cutting-edge. Oh, shit. Thanks. Um, I'm late for work. Sorry, I should go. I'll get this. - Are you sure? - Yeah. I got it. Okay. We should do this again sometime. Yeah. - Bye. - See you later. Luis? I have something special for you. ♪ Guantanamera... ♪ ♪ Guantanamera... ♪ Mira! Luis! Luis. Luis. Luis! Okay. Vaca frita, fried plantains, and yellow rice. Ahh! It's just like Mama used to make. Mm! Garcia? So, you're getting him to eat? Yeah. Interesting. Thanks. Ahh! Venga. Venga aquí. Come and sing. No. Come on. Si, si, si. Oh, you got a good voice. Come on, now. Some... some soul. Si. That's the way my papa taught me. Let me... let me show you. Let me get, uh... Oh, can I... can I help you? Yes, bring that back. Oh. Need help? Ah! Oh! Is that you? Mm. The boys. You guys played together? Si. Ernesto. He was such a charmer. What about him? Mauricio. Very serious. "Practice, practice, practice." Well, I guess somebody had to do it, right? Si. Yeah, we've known each other a long time... since we were about this high. Is that her? Si, it's my Elena. - So, was she the singer? - Si. Beautiful voice. "El Guitarrista with Los Cubanos." I like the name. Ah, wow. You played at the Tropicana? Si. Wow. So how did you end up here? Luis? What happened to Los Cubanos? I... I don't remember. Hi, Mina. I was just heading on break. Oh. Hi, Mr. Garcia. I'm gonna take your blood pressure, okay? Thank you. Ah. Oh. All necessary items, of course. This is why I don't go shopping with you. Ah, my cousin has never been one for frivolity. Correct. At least I managed to convince you to come to dinner the other night. Ah, thank you. Atesh was beginning to think you were avoiding him. Oh, before I forget, I have something for you. - For me? - Mm-hmm. It was in the bottom of the box my brother sent with Atesh. - Bismillah. - Bismillah. Ah! - My parents. - Oh. Ah, it's us. Oh... How? It was in the box. And Atesh? Ah, don't worry... My husband is not interested in your old photographs. Thank you. Oh, my God. His name is Luis, and he used to be this famous musician back in Cuba. He even played the Cotton Club. He played with Bauzá, Machito, Dizzy Gillespie. And he fell in love with this girl in Cuba named Elena. And he told you all of this? You should hear the way he talks about her. And I get that I should be minding my own business, I do. But... I just can't help but think that this man had an incredible life, and... now it's gone. His memories, his dignity, his freedom. It's all just... - You know what? - What? I think you should absolutely not mind your own business. Buon appetito. Ooh! I-is that me? I think so. Mm. Handsome guy, huh? [Did you really play with all these people? Mm. Wow. It's me? Ooh. - Okay, time to eat. - Ah! I... I worked really, really hard on this, so... I hope you enjoy it. Yeah! It's good. Not as good as your cooking, of course. It's true. What is it? Nothing. I... I was, um... just thinking. Share your thoughts. Hmm... Maybe... I could go back to vocal training. You don't have time for that, Mina. Well, I could do it Saturday mornings. What about your studies? I'll manage. If you have so much time, why don't you take another course? "Another course"? Yes, why not? Honestly, I don't understand where all this is coming from. First, the Cuban food, now the vocal lessons. What's next? I'm just trying new things. Okay? It's a boy... isn't it? What? All this nonsense. It's a Cuban boy. Am I right? No! No, you're not. Mina... Don't let me find out you've been lying to me. Is that you? - Yeah. - Ah! I think I was around five. Oh! Oh! You like music, eh? Yeah. Ah! - Yeah. - Where's your mama? She... she wasn't around very much. We're much alike, you and me. Eh... We're artists. I don't know about that. Oh, Si. you and me, we're artists, artists. Art teachers. - Huh? - Uh, how? We teach people how to love, eh? How to love. Bam! - Hey. - Hey. You'll never guess what I found. - What? - Somebody who knows El Guitarrista. Clarita? Oh, ha, you must be Kris. - Hi. - Welcome. - This is Mina. - Hello, Mina. - Hi. Nice to meet you. - It's lovely to meet you. Come in, please. Is it true? You met El Guitarrista? Oh, yes, he actually lives at the nursing home where I work. And you're sure it's him? I did a lot of research. It's definitely him. A forgotten legend. But what is he doing on this side of the border? Last anyone knew, he was in New York. I don't know. He... has dementia. Aw, no. That is heartbreaking. Garcia was the most respected musician of his time. But after the revolution, he couldn't go back to Cuba. Why? Your guess is as good as mine. He wasn't political. Can you tell me anything about him? His band was started by his paternal grandfather. Garcia became a member because his father was a member. And the other members were children of the other players. Childhood friends. Yes, yes. They were well-known. But Garcia... Garcia, he was exceptional. He played with all the best musicians in the clubs in Havana. - And then he went to New York, right? - Yes, yes. And I read that he even played at the Cotton Club? The Cotton Club, the Half Note, the Copacabana... And I heard he met a woman and left New York. But I don't know for sure. And what about Elena? Who's Elena? The... the singer. Elena Acosta? Ah, yes, I remember her. She had a bit of a career. But whether she's alive or dead now, I don't know. Luis says that she was the love of his life. Really? Yeah, that's why I figured I would ask you if you knew anything about her. I'll ask my friends. There are many artists in Cuba, but the circle is small. Why don't you come and see my friends perform at the Havana Lounge? The best musicians from Cuba play every Friday night. Yes, we... we would love to. I'm actually looking forward to Friday night. That piano player was amazing. Here we are, my humble abode. - Wow. This is cool. - Yeah, thanks. Make yourself at home. You thirsty? Can I get you something to drink? Let's see. What do I have here? Uh, beer and... nope, that's beer, too. Um, water is fine. Great. - Here you go. - Thanks. You play? Yeah, a little bit. Let's see here. Hmm? I had fun tonight. Me, too. May I? Yeah, of course. It's been so long. There you go. My, uh... my grandfather taught me. What were those chords? Um, A, D, and E, I think. Mm-hmm. - Like that? - Yeah. You're really good. It's a couple of chords. ♪ Yo soy un hombre sincero ♪ ♪ De donde crece la palma ♪ ♪ Yo soy un hombre sincero ♪ ♪ De donde crece la palma ♪ ♪ Y antes de morir yo quiero ♪ ♪ Cantar mis versos del alma ♪ Your voice is beautiful. Thanks. I haven't sung that song in ages. Really? Why not? Just... life. - Hi. - Hi. Uh, I'm here to see Mr. Luis Garcia. Of course. Just sign in there. Okay, thank you. All right. Oh, it's just down the hall on your left. Thank you. He doesn't usually have visitors. That's odd. I wonder who that could be. Hello? Um, Mr. Luis Garcia? Si. Uh, I brought you something here. Hmm? Pretty nice, right? El Guitarrista. Oh! Whoa! Whoo! Whoa! ♪ Siempre que te pregunto... ♪ ♪ Que cuándo, cómo y dónde ♪ ♪ Tu siempre me respondes ♪ ♪ Quizás, quizás, quizás ♪ Otra vez, otra vez. ♪ Y así pasan los días ♪ ♪ y yo desesperando ♪ ♪ Y tu, tu contestando ♪ ♪ Quizás, quizás, quizás ♪ Yeah! - Hey. - Hey. - You ready to go? - Yeah.

I'll, uh, I'll get out here. I can come up. Why? I don't know. It's early and... I mean, I showed you my place. It can't possibly be worse than that. It's my aunt's place, so... Great! I'm great with aunts! Not tonight. Um, she had surgery. Oh, shit. I'm sorry. Is she okay? Yeah, sh-she'll be fine. Um, I'll see you tomorrow. 'Kay, see you tomorrow. Ah! Okay. I'll be right back. Luis? Are you ready? I have a surprise for you. What do you think? Let's go. Elena? Uh-huh. Ah! Whoo! There we go. - Let's go! - Oh... yah! - Ay! - Luis, what took you so long? Luis, my man!

You know I gotta commit. - I'm a performer. - Yeah, I was surprised. - Here we go. - All right. Where are we going? - I don't know. Grab a bite, maybe? - Yeah. I saw the show. You were all wonderful. - Oh. Thank you! - Thank you! Mina? I'll see you guys. Later. I should have known... the food, the music. I did nothing wrong. What was that today? I was helping a patient. - You're not a doctor. - I will be. Not at this rate. Did you forget what your father fought for? Education is the only thing that will make you free in this world. I'm already free, in case you didn't know! Okay? That's the whole point of being a child refugee. Things are not so simple. Well, why not! Why can't they be simple? I don't want you to see that boy again. What are we talking about? He's a man. Yeah, and I'm 19! It's a distraction. Is it because he's not Muslim? You're here, Mina, in a university. You have every opportunity in front of you. You need to stay focused! You're talking about it as if it's life and death. And it's not. I worked many years to build my career and only to start all over again when I came to this country. You don't have to face what I have gone through! You can make something of yourself! Stop being so concerned about my future! I put food on this table and I send you to school for your future. Where is your gratitude, young lady? What if I don't want to be like you? You're the one who loved being a doctor. Why don't you go back to school and become a doctor? Now you're talking nonsense! Well, you could take night classes. I'd be dead before I finish. Okay, then, accept help and go to university full-time. Atesh said if you sell the land, you could have so much more money. - Don't talk to me about Atesh! - Why not? What's your problem with Atesh? What does Atesh know? What does he know? Grandfather said you were a great doctor. That you loved your job and you were surrounded by colleagues and friends. Now you don't see anyone anymore. You don't understand how things are. Actually, I do. I've seen the pictures. The ones with the girl. Your friend! Did you really think I wouldn't figure it out? You hide them away as if they're... your most precious possessions. We're not in Afghanistan, Amma. You can live the life that you want here. It is not your place to talk about such things. Well, that's why you left, right? Because of her? Life wasn't about singing and playing guitar in the kitchen. There were bombings, killing all the time. Half the time, we didn't know which side was doing what. I know you were just a little girl, but you must remember some of it. What about the time a suicidal bomber killed the neighbors? You used to play with those children. Remember. That's the day my father decided to send you to me... when he stopped believing anything would change. We can't change the past, Mina. All we have left is our future. Mr. Garcia, good afternoon. Hello. I know I'm early. My flight was ahead of schedule. If you don't mind squeezing me in. Not at all. Make yourself comfortable and I'll be with you in just a minute. Thank you very much. Excuse me. Excuse me, um, hi. Are you Luis Garcia's son? Yes. I'm Mina Ayoub. I spend a lot of time with your dad. Michael. I, I didn't know he had a son. We're not close. He's been remembering things. Like what? He's been remembering his life back in Cuba, and all of his music and... That's... before my time. Sure, but if you just, you know, sat down with him for a few minutes, I'm sure he would love to see you... Thank you. I'm on a really tight schedule. You don't have time to talk to your dad? You don't know him, do you? I know he's a sweet man, and that he enjoys company... He's a drunk. At least that's how I remember him. He left when I was eight, and I haven't heard from him since. Oh. Then why are you taking care of him...? - Listen... - Mr. Garcia? Come on in. I do it as a favor to my mother. She's a much better person than I am. Have a good day. Luis? Luis! There you are. Let's get you back in the room for lunch. Come on, Luis, lunch is waiting. Luis? Oh. Okay, Luis. 'Kay, we're gonna get you all cleaned up, okay? Come on. We've got this, okay? Come on. All right. And... up! Come on, Luis, come on. You can do this. Come on. Work with me. Let's go. Come! - Hm. - What happened to him? - Who? - Mr. Garcia. We gave him an injection. It was doctor's orders. I'm sorry, but we need to keep him calm at this stage. Here. Take my seat. - There you go. - Ah, thank you, dear. Mina? Come with me, please. Sorry, Mr. Garcia. We need to take this away. We need healthy food for your heart, right? Oh, don't do that, Mr. Garcia. I'm trying to help you. First, I'd like to acknowledge the great work that you've been doing. Thank you. And I wanted to let you know that there's been talk about starting a music program for some of the residents here. Really? Yes. Apparently, a lot of facilities have been doing it, - and they've been getting great results. - Mina... And this is, honestly, just the beginning. I have so many ideas. - I mean... - Mina! We can bring in local musicians, and we can start a day program for non-residents with dementia and... I'm afraid I have to let you go. What? I carefully created that meal plan for Mr. Garcia. He has a serious heart condition. Yeah, I know, but I had to do something. He wasn't eating. You needed to follow our care approach. If I leave, he'll go back to the way he was. Well, it may help you to know he's being transferred. He's being moved to a palliative care facility in Kingston. His son thought it was best. Mr. Garcia's health is in decline. Luis. Mina... you've done more for this man than anyone could expect. But you can't save him. He'll be all alone. It's up to his family. He's being transferred this Saturday. I'm sorry. I should've listened. Yeah. You were too involved. There's a job for you at the restaurant. Atesh is expecting you after class tomorrow. I... I thought we didn't want Atesh's help. Hmm... you'll work for it. Don't forget to congratulate him. On what? His daughter's engagement. What? Zahra's fiancé just arrived from Afghanistan. They'll be expanding the restaurant business. I guess she didn't tell you, huh? How is she doing? She's learning. She's a smart girl. She will learn quickly. Did you hear my daughter's engaged? Wow! Congratulations! - That's wonderful news, Mr. Karzai! - Thank you. You must be so proud. I am, thank you. How's your food? It's excellent. Thank you so much. Hey, Mina. Um... I haven't heard from you... and I hope everything's okay. Call me. Table three needs water. Okay. Mina! Mina, where the hell have you been? I'm sorry. I... I can explain. You didn't respond to any of my messages. What's going on? I've been wanting to talk to you. You're literally walking away from me. Look, Mina, if you don't want to see me anymore, just say so. No, it's not that. It's just I needed time. Time for what? You have no idea what my life has been like lately. Yeah, you're right, I don't. I got fired! Okay? Now I'm stuck bussing tables at my second cousin's restaurant! Oh, God. That sounds so horrible. And I can't see Luis anymore. Ah, right, Luis. What's that supposed to mean? It means I think you're getting a little too caught up in a fantasy. What are you talking about? You were completely onboard last week. Yeah, and I still am now but Mina, you... you think you can fix people and... and bring the past back. Luis is still a dying man. You need to wrap your head around that! But that doesn't mean he can't live now! I mean, we're all gonna die, anyways! Well, that's bleak. Well, it's true. You don't know if you're gonna cross a street and get hit by a car! Or if a bomb is gonna fall out of the sky! Yeah, or if your girlfriend's gonna suddenly need to marry somebody else. I didn't know anything about that, okay? Ethan is a mess, okay? He's in love with her. What do I tell him? Tell him to forget about her. That's fucked up. Look, I'm not like Zahra. Really? You wouldn't even introduce me to your aunt. It was a timing thing. Oh, like, there's a good time to have that conversation? Look, it doesn't even matter because she already knows! And? It's complicated. It's complicated. Sure it is. You know what, Mina? I give up. Kris, wait. You know what I think? You have no interest in letting me into your life. - That's not true! - Really? Now that your life's falling apart, you've managed to alienate the one person that actually could've been there for you. ♪ Happy Birthday to you... ♪ ♪ Happy Birthday to you! ♪ ♪ Happy Birthday, Mr. Garcia! ♪ ♪ Happy Birthday to you! ♪ Yay! Make a wish! You can blow out your candles, Mr. Garcia. Yay! Hi, Luis. Oh, hola. Happy Birthday, my friend. Is it my birthday? Yeah. You had cake today. Ahh! I like cake. Oh, I know. How old am I? Doesn't matter. Did I have cake today? Yeah. Ahh! I like cake. Did you come to take me away from here? No. Ah. - Hello? - Hey. Can we talk? I had to punch in the code three times, sorry. I know. The door sticks. I'm not used to this. No, I'm sorry for what I said last night. Okay, that was wrong. I shouldn't have... Sorry. I don't want to lose you. I just don't want to play games, Mina. I'm not that kinda guy. H-hey, hey. They're moving Luis into palliative care tomorrow. Shit. How's he doing? Pretty disoriented. I guess he knows that it's... over. I just... I wish I could've done more, you know? I know. Hey... wait a minute. Isn't... isn't today Friday? Yeah, why? Oh, my God. It's Friday. Yeah. - Gang... Sir. - Come in, come in. We missed them. Can't believe you still had these. Well, Zahra hasn't picked them up from my place, 'cause she'd rather take heat from the drama department than face me again. Anyway... here we go. - Oh, wow! - Wow! This is perfect. Where did you find this? It was just sitting in my grandfather's closet. All right. You're amazing. Luis, get you up on your feet. Let's see how this looks on you. Where are you taking me? - Taking you home. - What? Okay, okay, come on, come on. All right. One second, okay, Luis? Sir, I just need to grab this, okay? You're gonna get it back real soon. Thank you. Let's go. Come on! Luis, come on! We gotta go! You good? Let's go! Go, go! Vamanos! Whoo! All right! - Yeah! - Yeah! Whoo! - Yeah! - Whoo! Hola! Hi. This is El Guitarrista.

Thank you. Bye, Mina. - Thank you. - You're welcome. My friend, Mario, was just back in Cuba. He found Los Cubanos. Really? And he found Elena. She's so happy to hear the news about her friend, Luis. She sent a letter back for you. Please. "My dearest Mina... I am pleased to hear my darling Luis is alive and well. Ernesto is no longer with us, but my husband, Mauricio, and I are doing well." Wait. She married Mauricio? It would seem that way. It never happened. What? Luis' great love, it wasn't real. It was real... for him. So... what are you gonna do now? Okay, uh, I think it's... - Where? - We're close. 206... I think it's this way. Man, it's hot. Whoo! We're close, for sure. Uh, 203... 206. 206, this is it. Hola. Bienvenidos. Hola. Yo soy Elena.
