Yes, Oka. Oka from Osaka! He's a pain. "You love me?" I don't need his money so I ditched him. I don't need his money so I ditched him OK, I'm on my way. Think of his money! Call him. Oh, shut up! Go on! He's a regular. He always comes here. I've had enough of him! He's a creep. Get me a younger guy. I'm funny! I'm sexy! I'm kind! Hello, President! Girls with red badges are 2, 500 bahts for 2 hours. Blue's for all night at 3, 500 bahts. White is for a drink. Take out a girl for an extra 1,200 bahts. You're late, bigshot. Hello! How about some golf, Mister? Nice shot, very good! The President is here. Nomura wants you to serve him. Me? Why me...? Get ready quickly. OK? Luck, is my dress too tiny? No, you look gorgeous. You too. So the President owns a ramen shop. The ramen's bad. It's in Thong Lo so he boasts about it. But it's in the suburbs so no one goes. Any Breath Care, Ling? My client will get me some. I'm out too. You mean, old Yoshida? Disgusting! I hate him. He licks my nipples until I'm drenched with his saliva. You're off? To please old men. Alright. Yoshida uses drugs you know? You want ice? I'll ask Bing. Ready? - No. - Come on! Let him wait. - Hey. - You look pretty. Thanks. - You have Breath Care? - No, sorry. Every year 1.5 million Japanese visit Thailand. More than any country! Wow! Really? Girls! I heard Thaniya caters to Japanese. You should know those facts Do your research. Take is easy, Sir. We have the Number 1 girl. Can you be quiet? Can't you see I'm talking? Anyhow.. Guess what Japanese dish us Japanese crave when we're abroad? A well-known travel agency did a questionnaire on the subject. Can you guess Number 1? Maybe sushi? No, it must be ramen, right? I want ramen! Looks like Kai is yours tonight. Let's all go. We'll have ramen with dumplings! Y'all go ahead. Thanks for the drink. You're coming, Number 1. No thank you, I'm OK! Have fun. Who speaks Japanese? - I want this girl. - Okay. She rejected me! Aren't Thai girls easier than Filipinas? What's going on? They've lost their innocence. Sorry, Sir. This place sucks tonight. I know a place with lots of girls. The college girls have cosplay night! How about a threesome? I heard Thai girls don't suck dicks. Traditionally. I want a cutie who gives head! How many girls you got? 30. Want a look? Sound good? OK, Witto. Follow him. This way. Have fun. Let's go. Hi, Shin! Good timing. - What? - You know what I want. I'm a guide, not a dealer. I only deal to my clients Your stuff is good and cheap. You buy from me and resell it! I hate Japanese guys who rip off other Japanese! I don't do that now! Did Mr. Tomioka contact you? - I'm not going. - Yeah.. I hate the Japanese on Sukhumvit. Who else can you do business with? Whatever. Don't mention me to them. Exchanging money? Was he rich? A Rolex Submariner. See you! Hey, Shin! OK, talk to you soon. You're working so late. You understand English too? Did the plane trip tire you? Yeah, exactly. But I use business class because I fly so often. I want to stretch my legs. This one. Oh, this is awesome! How about that? No... How about white shoes? Cool! So he was loaded! Can you keep him? Have I ever failed? Never. Your mom again? She's persistent. She wants cash for Yaa Baa but she doesn't like your job. Maybe she's addicted? She could be losing it. Give her money and it won't end. I told you many times. You Thais make no sense to me. I'd stop all contact! Kai, you gained 2 kilos? A 1,000 bahts fine. Watch out! I had less clients last month. 5 regulars didn't come. It's bad. I'm paying for my sister's tuition and my brother's motorbike. Lend me some, Nat. You know I can't! I have 2 kids to feed. My brother has no work but his wife had a baby. I'm supporting them Ling, lend Kai some money. I can't. We're getting evicted. I need a house before I can lend money. Money trouble? There's a big party coming up All of you have to come - Seriously? - Yes. Go for it! See the Isan girl. She only talks to the Bangkok girls. OK, who speaks Japanese? Who's coming with me? All night! Good. Who'll give me a blow job? You! Make it quick. ...the season comes around And the first snow falls like petals We see it together Standing side by side Nothing makes me happier It's not about dependence nor weakness I just love you so much I felt it deep from the bottom of my heart Sabai dii mai, girls? Good. This is Mr. Kinjo. Hello, Sir. They're wonderful! Please sit. They understand Japanese? You need lots of girls We have enough girls. That's not the problem. Some guests want drugs I don't do them myself. Really? You should try ice! - You know Dr. Nagai? - No. A methamphetamine invented by a Japanese. Metham.. What is it? Me-tham-pheta-mine. Don't get me wrong. I don't mind if you do it but I'm cautious round my competitors. The Japanese community is small I'm sorry! Leave the drugs to us. Right, Shin? Right. Leave the dirty work to us. Let's have a toast. A toast, to us! Here you are! Good party It's a success. What the..? Mr. Sasaki, come in here. You party hard. The moment you arrive! The last time I was out cold for 3 whole days. No shit! For the money you spend on a night in Roppongi you can have 20 in Bangkok. Isn't Thailand great? It's utopia. Hey, girls! You know him? He gets things. Like SIM-free phones. He's a gofer for tourists. - A failed actor. - Shin! Thank you! Are you sure? We're broke. - Here. - Thank you. Thanks for tagging along. We're needed to get the party started. We can leave soon. I owe the guy nothing but I can't say no. You're compassionate, Shin. Thank you. You know? You hardly get out. You deserve some fun. If you like any of the girls take her home. - Is that how it goes tonight? - Sure is. Wild guys win in Bangkok. OK, I understand. I get it, I get it! Luck? Darling? What's going on? Why...? Long time no see. Hey, hold it there! I looked for you: I've missed you so much! Wait! Don't go! Ouch... It's you who left me! OK, OK. Cover yourself up Are you going out? I bumped into an old client. I'll be back. - So it's work? - Yes. - Witto! - Hey, Shin. I gotta go. Who is he? My friend. Get up. Ozawa is leaving. Set your alarm every 30 minutes! Where's Mr. Ozawa want to go? I don't know but he's leaving. I hate him. Shin? How did you.. meet him? What have you been doing? You were in Bangkok? Do you really love me? After you left I waited for you at the bar every day. I left letters with the Madam for you. I bet you never read them. It was all too much so I went back to Japan. Why did you come back? 'Coz there's no place in Japan for me. You haven't changed a bit. I went to Japan, I came back, met Shin and we got along. He's been kind to me. Check this out. - It's my dog. - How cute! No, the diamonds. It was 700,000 yen. What! 700,000 yen? A diamond studded collar? I'm the Number 1 girl now. I bought Mom a house. You're incredible! You always wanted to do that. She must be so happy. Are you from Nong Khai? You haven't changed in the slightest. What a pigsty, my tee rak. It's no place to bring girls. Oh, come on. I have friends over. Really? Anyway, you should move out. No air con, no nothing. Why live here? Darling. What's konjak? Konjak? Is that from a client? It's kon yaku. To get engaged. Oh shit! - Did I just..? - What? I lost 50,000 yen. One of my clients wants to marry me. And? Japanese men always promise marriage. The liars! You want to marry a Japanese client and go to Japan? There's nothing good there. The economy's down! Meltdown! Everything, down! Got that? The Japanese men I know are all loaded. Sure. What? You're full of shit! Don't use bad words. Don't speak like that. Why not? I like swearing. I love the look on your face. What look? You're jealous. I am not... Hey, quit playing this! Sorry but it is work. It's a game called Real Money Trade. I need money to pay you, Luck. I remember when you gave me money. That one time, 5 years ago. Thank you, Luck! Is your brother's name Jimmy? Is he in high school? He might have a girlfriend? Your Thai has improved. You think so? What do you want? I don't know. You have to help me... figure it out. Oh, wow! It's Jimmy. Hello? I'm fine. I can talk now. I deposited your school money. Who? I will not talk to her. Do you understand? Why did you have to see her? I wish you'd listen to me If you see Mom again you can't call me. OK? What about your mom? Nothing. What's wrong? Nothing! I remember what your mom's calls did to you. You cried. Yes, I remember that too. Want breakfast? Cool. I'm hungry. - Something spicy. - I want KFC. want to eat som tam. Not again! Come on. Gimme a break. Shit! Kinjo, are you straight back from Samut Sakhon? I've never been there. Is it good? It's pretty nice. My wife's from there. I'm the only Japanese It's OK if you can endure Thai food every day. Thank God for the air conditioner. I didn't mean that. meant for our business. You know? Sorry, I love Thailand so.. Let me see.- They have some Japanese seafood companies. You're here! Sit next to me. We're about to begin. This is Ozawa. believe you two have met? was his superior in the Army. I had no idea! So we can trust him! Back when he and I were on a PKO in Cambodia the tension in Southeast Asia was ongoing. Every day, the Pol Pot guerrillas would. Mr. Tomioka, shall I brief them? Sorry I got carried away! Mr. Horie will tell you the plan. Gentlemen. Let me outline our plan for you. I'm Horie with Asian Mercy Corporation. ASEAN economic integration means development. Our profits are from income and capital gains from presold condominiums As we Japanese have learned a boom like this can't last You follow me? So we offer premium condos to elderly men with a wife attached! Thai women are very devoted. They look after their men in old age. "Paradise It's paradise for old men! This will work. Right, Kinjo? You get customers and I'll get girls. - Let's do it! - Well..I dunno. My only dream is to own a stall someday. Why? Don't miss a chance to get rich. It requires no money. Stalls are for the Thais. Don't get me wrong. I'll help you out. Sugano will get customers. - Uh, but.. - You need to be decisive! This could be your comeback. We'll help you. Drink up, Mr. Tomioka! You can sell these. But Mr. Oka gave you these. You sure? What can I do? I can only keep Sasagawa's presents. I can't keep track of what I get. Write their names on them. Is Sasagawa coming soon? I better stay away from your apartment. Yeah. He's like a sniffer dog. He'd know. Here. Your share from the party. I appreciate your help. About Ozawa.. If he's an old client can't you stay away from him? He is close to Tomioka so.. He comes to me, not the other way around. I knew it! I mean, he has no money. We don't need those old clients now. So Tsuji doesn't know? He believes Naam quit being an escort. So he keeps supporting her. She's his Thai wife on a payroll. Yeah. She cleans, does his laundry and provides sex. Naam, what do you make monthly? 50,000. - Not much. - I know! You should ask for more. Has he lived in Thailand long? I bet they're Coyote girls. Coyote girls. Sounds expensive. They have to be over 160 cm tall. They're out of my league. What a party! Coyote girls. Karaoke girls... and go-go dancers. It's Bangkok Girls Expo. Rich men's parties are like being at a Ginza nightclub. Each to his own. I hate that! That's why I came here. Listen. I take a local bus to Nong Khai once a month. It's so remote! - By local bus? - It takes forever. Here's the thing. I get to see towns along the way. Those rural towns are so cool That's the Thailand you never see But you don't speak Thai. It's better not to speak! Rural people are innocent so eye contact is the best. I used to be an actor so I'm good at it. Words get in the way Oops. Excuse us. What the hell? Naam, happy birthday! Thanks, Darling. Listen, I'm a guide so I don't want trouble. But leave my pal alone. You know what I'm saying? Snob! Hello -Yes? - You have a moment? - What is it? You and Ozawa. I guess you two are close. That's right. The sea scares me. You're scared of any water. Can you swim now? Oh, you remember! Early in our relationship we went to an island. That island... It's my happiest memory. You wanna go? - No. - Why not? I'm tired of islands. My clients always take me. One day I'll go to hell Where are you from, Driver? - Korat. - Right. That's northeast? Yes, in Isan. Luck, there's a police checkpoint. No problem. Let's go around. No, we could do a set up. We can take advantage of the cops. I know them. Let's not tonight. Oh, really.. Private First Class Ozawa I have an order for you. We must secure a foothold in the postwar peace time. During the Vietnam War, the US had airbases in Isan for their bombings. It changed commerce. People moved to Bangkok for work and Thailand developed. You know that? It's not politicians nor merchants. It's always soldiers who go in first and pave the way. You got that? I'm broke and my visa will expire. I don't mind going to Laos. You want me to check out real estate? Great, you're going! I'll pay you well. By the way, how's it going? The game business. Listen to this. The best money making game was updated so currency can't be exchanged. It's game over for Real Money Trade. Right. Everything has its limit. This club is all I've got in Thailand. But there's still Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar. Be the first and you'll make it big. You want to end up a beggar like those Japanese? We want a building in Svay Pak! Svay Pak, Phnom Penh... It was for pedophiles. I'll take care of Cambodia. You know nothing about Laos. A man named Kogami will be in Vientiane. Find him. Who is he? He left behind some trouble in Japan. He used to work for me. Now he's wound up in Laos. He's OK. Yes, Sergeant. It's a recon mission. Very good, PFC Ozawa! Go to Laos and infiltrate. Lots of girls! New girls too. Just take a look. See you. Hey, Ozawa! Come here. Small world, huh? Tomioka's been kind to me. I've been in on the project all along. You're probably clueless but ask me anything I'll help you out. I just go where I'm told to go. I'm like his gofer. And today? Luck, right? She's here. Come on, follow me. Welcome! - Come on in. - Hello! - I'm kind! - Look at me! No, no. Luck! Luck! - Go on. - That was quick! My mom... She hated my dad. That's why she hates me. Your real dad? He was Thai? Right. I actually have a sister. My third dad's kid. So I need to make more money. A sister.. Here's the ferry. See you soon. Sugano, what's up? I'm making a detailed map of the Bangkok canals. - Is it work? - Not really. How about you? I live around the corner so... - 67. - Oh, in the neighborhood. You want to walk with me? Sure. That way? Let's go. 13 years! A Japanese firm sent me here as a manager. You know how lazy the locals are. I drove them hard but I'd be up all night finishing their work. I'm a typical Japanese, I guess. Now, you do a bit of everything. Right. Miss! What do you recommend? We have yam nua, som tam, tom sep... I'll have tom sep. One? Yes. Don't make it too spicy. I'll have kung yang. By the way, Ozawa do you know anything about printing? I was a proofreader for a printing company. I know the best way to proof documents and find typos. You don't read the text. Look at it with your left eye and at the print with the right. you visually overlap them. Suddenly the typos jump out at you. You never miss them. I apply that now to people and to myself. And to Thai society. I'm always checking for errors. Ozawa. I must look like a total loser to you... Well, I used to be with the Self-Defense Forces. I messed around a few years after high school The local recruiters talked me into it. And then... That's when I was 20. My first overseas trip was on a PKO tour to Cambodiat. Japan's bubble economy had just burst. After all that partying they began to panic. In Cambodia I saw soldiers from everywhere pay so little for girls. I did too. And I fell hard for a girl. Then what happened? Well... that's about it. I couldn't save her... Save her? Well, you know. You mean, the lady at the pier? No, no. She's not the one. I guess she has more money than me. She's a Thaniya girl. So you're in Thailand because of a woman? I knew her 5 years ago and bumped into her. It's proof that Asia is paradise for men. Uh... right. It's paradise if you stay outside Have som tam, delicious som tam I knew it. Right. It was a perfect opportunity to prove that Mr. Tsuji has a Thai wife. So Kinjo asked Nat to arrange it. And I went in and took photos. Should you be telling us? I was tired of being a loser so Kinjo gave me work. I just do whatever is asked of me. But is that OK? Here I go again... I told you, Shin, because you know Mr. Tsuji... Sugano, I know everything. I bet the wives in Japan hire you and their cheating husbands. Right... Either way it's work. That's how I see it. You're nice, Sugano. Give me a break! Wake up, Luck is a Thaniya girl! Don't go back to that whore! It's OK with me! Shin, I know you care. It's an eternal mystery. Yeah. I-used to have a Thai wife. She came from Mukdahan. Just north of Yasothon. Near the Laos border. This woman here.. She came from Yasothon to sell som tam. For a small profit. Did you say you're going to Laos? Is that for Tomioka? I gotta make money. So I can take Luck out. What? You're still paying the bar? He's hopeless... For good luck! Sorry I'm late! You sure are! I take our clients to the hotel, deliver drugs, etc., while you do nothing. Oh, shut up! ...Okay. Hello? Hello, Aunty? Right. What? 20,000 bahts? What is it this time? Oh, Auntie... OK. I'm busy now. Look after Jimmy for me. Okay? Thank you. For last night. Tee rak, I don't want your money. Why? You're not a client, that's why. Sorry, it's a client. Hello? Are you at the airport? Luck. Don't worry. I understand. The timing is perfect... I'll go to Laos to make some money. The night bus will get me to Vientiane by noon. Wait for me? Huh? What's that? You leave today? How dare you? You'll be working and I'm broke. That's why I don't take your money! That's not it. You want to save up. I know all that. My visa will expire soon so I'll go to Laos. Me! Me! It's always about you! You have to work and so do l. I can't see you anyway. It's for the best. You're leaving now? Wait, Luck! You need more money! That's why I'm... Hey! Oh, come on! You're leaving now? Yes. My aunt needs me. Things are bad. Jimmy won't listen to me. And I haven't been home. Take care of my apartment and dog. How would I get a hold of ice? Ask Bing Is it OK? - Did you understand that? - No. That's enough, I'm going. I'll cal you. Oh, you cutie! You'll go to Vientiane. I'm going back to Nong Khai. Help me buy presents for my family in Chinatown. Hurry up! Right now! A military base? A base? It's an international airport. It was a US military base long ago. My 2nd dad used to work here. That's right, your 2nd dad was a US soldier. He flew airplanes a long time ago. So he was a pilot! Amazing! I was a foot soldier. The Vietnam War... Hey. You were in the Army. Don't tell Jimmy. Like I told you, it's great Country life is really great All the locals will tell you so Get up early Listen to the birds And nap under a Banyan tree With crossed legs A branch as a pillow And an everlasting breeze Clean air No need for an air conditioner Mom! This is my mother. Huh? Grandma is my mom now! Nice to meet you, ma'am My name is Ozawa. This is my first time in Nong Khai. It's very beautiful. You speak Thai well! This is for you. Hi, Aunty Kwaang Hello. This is Aunty Kwaang That's Aom. Thank you. And for you. Come on, say thank you. Is this too bright for me? They're popular in Bangkok now. You like it, Aunty? I can put many things in it. Nice color too. Yes! Jimmy, come in. - Hello. - Greet him properly OK, Jimmy... Do you know Bruce Lee? Here Jimmy, it's yours. Bring the plates, Saaw. Jimmy, put the rice there. - Jimmy, stay! - I'll go get Kin. Walk! Don't take the motorbike. Your sister is tough... Is it good? Is it delicious? It's very good. In Isan dialect it's "saep laai laai." Saep laai laai! - That's good. - Thank you. So Kin didn't work? He was helping in the field, Sis. Be quiet, Jimmy. Be quiet, Jimmy I keep telling you not to join the army You won't listen I want to be a soldier, not a monk. Soldiers have the worst job. You'd be sent down south. What if you're shot? Your hometown is much better. Don't do it. Stay here. Don't do what you'll regret. Once you're sent to the south they'll make you work all day. They won't let you rest. It's worse in a war. You should become a monk. That's the best way Anyway you've heard all this before. We should eat. You understand, boy? All boys become monks. - For their parents.. - No, that's wrong This is about Jimmy. Not his mom! What's the Japanese man do? Does he work? He's on a business trip so I asked him to drop by. I never brought a man home before. So you'll quit and go to Japan with him? Not yet. He's a good man but he isn't rich. How much does he make? As long as he works it'll work out. Love is more important than money. But I want to save up while I can. Did he give you a ring? Will you introduce him to your mom? Did you talk to her? She wants Jimmy back. She's worried about him. She can't have Jimmy back! Ozawa, me, Jimmy and Ying will live together. She'll be alone! She's your mother. Grandma is my mom! Huh! Is everyone asleep? Yeah. Come on, quick! You better pay back the soccer money. Or they'll kill you. Where's Ying? Jimmy, come here. Let's talk. Ask her. Go on. - Sister, Ying. - What? Give me money for weed. You're out already? The Japanese guy. He smokes a lot. Is this enough? Thank you! Money, oh, money I'd be OK anywhere if I had money Let me smoke a little Just pack one up and let me get high A bong, oh, a bong If I had a bong, a beautiful bong... Good evening. You from Bangkok? It's sad not to have a place to call home. Do you agree? This will be your home one day. "Until then I proclaim that I am Thai, a free man." "I'll act in a way that reflects the name" "and will continue the fight." My name is Chit Phumisak. I live in the jungle. Learn to speak the Isan dialect as soon as possible. Thank you. Stay away! Why? The buffalo knows who's family. Tee rak! Jimmy! Come on. See over there? Do you see the chickens? Go and look at them. Let them be. They'll soon outgrow you. Oh, come on, Aunty! They're still tiny. Maybe they'll grow up gorgeous like me. My sister, Ying thinks I see Mom. Yeah. Where does your mom live? In a house Ying bought her. I used to live there but Ying took me away when she fought with Mom. We don't have the same father, her and I. My father's an American. He's dead now, by the way. He's the one who gave me this. "Air America". It's nice! OK, Jimmy. You know? I was a soldier too Oh, really? I helped Cambodians 20 years ago. I made roads, deliver water. I was only an infantry soldier. So why did you become a soldier? I'm a country boy. I don't like school. But I like motorcycle. Bosozoku, you know? A biker gang? That's it. Actually I had nowhere to go. Why... you want to be soldier? I don't know. I'm Thai. That's the way it is. You're great. You know? I hate this place. Stop! You can't go there! That's the house my sister bought! Don't! She'll be upset with me. Hi, Jimmy! Ying! Ying, my little sis. Same name as Luck. Mom wanted to call her that. How's Mom? She's well. Why don't you come see us, Jimmy? Sorry. I'll visit you. Where's he from? Ying! - How are you? - You just turn up! - How's your family? - Good. - You ate? - Yes. - Who is he? - I missed you! I just arrived. - You're gorgeous! - Aren't I? You're fit! Paj, your work's finished, isn't it? - Tick, can you take Paj home? - Yeah, sure. Paj, say thanks to your mom for the fabric. The embroidery is fantastic. Bye bye, Charles. Chinese, aren't you? Korean? - I'm Japanese. - You're Japanese. Welcome to paradise. You'll stay? Until I sort out our family problem. You'll see your mom? Oh, you know me. Yes but go see her! Well, I guess... It's up to him. Is the Japanese guy with you? He looks Vietnamese. You think so? The moment we arrived he got along with everyone. He smoked weed and danced with everyone. Like an idiot. I envy you, Ying. I want to go to Bangkok. You sisters wouldn't make it in Bangkok. You and your jungle dance! Watch it! You're in Nong Khai! Oh, I'm a Bangkok girl. We used to dig potatoes together! OK, Apple! Let's go! All right! I don't understand white men's taste in women Carl's in love with my sister. Is he nice? I don't know. Thanks but I can't smoke. Because I have no mouth. Are you Vietnamese? My name is Chit. I'm an operative. After Saigon was liberated the Thanom regime became oppressive in Bangkok. Students and farmers escaped the city I want to help them hide in the jungle. I need financial support. I'm waiting for instruction from Hanoi. Pardon? Tee rak, you really saw him? A ghost? It's like I said. Twice? In the woods and by the river? You didn't imagine it? You saw him? He's a famous ghost. I'm scared! He wasn't scary. Really? Tell me you're not scared. Long ago many people were killed here. Their skeletons are everywhere. Only enlightened people see ghosts You know that? Hey, Charles! This guy talked to a ghost! Nothing weird about that We're in Thailand, Lady. There are ghosts everywhere. A few years ago they decimated the communist guerrillas in Isan forest. In the Vietnam War? The Indochina War At that time Isan forest was like a commune. Even Caravan was there. Paj's family, they're Laos. She's a Hmong. And the Hmongs were used and abandoned by the Americans. And when you think about it there's something rotten in this fucking paradise. Don't drink it. Look at me. Paj, you can go now. Thank you. This is perfect. You like it? I love it here. I've been looking for a place like this. I want to live here. It's up to you. I've had enough of Bangkok. I have something I want to tell you. Listen. I won't let mom have my siblings. Jimmy and Ying? Mom hates Ying too, not just me. Because Ying's dad abused Mom. It made me hate Thai men. Is your mother to blame for everything? I mean... Maybe she's a victim too. No. In the end she is to blame. - Listen... - She's bad! She is and you know it. What about Jimmy? Sorry but I told him everything. He's thinking about his own future. You should hear him out. Listen. You understand nothing. He's still a kid. I'll work hard and start a business in Bangkok. I'll buy another house. For Jimmy, Ying and you. We'll live together. I love Ducati bikes. I'll buy you one. How's that? You don't want one? Why not? You're not buying it. I'm the one paying for it. Don't be a snob! I have an idea! It doesn't have to be Bangkok. Start a business here with your family. I'll help you. Sound good? How's that? I know, I want a GTO bike. A Kawasaki. Like the old model at Smile Bar. Ying? Pay attention to Jimmy's English lesson. Jimmy, you should go to college. You can become a soldier or a monk later. - But... - I'll be fine. have Ying. I'd do anything for you. Ying, give Jimmy a Coca Cola. You understand? Ying's back. Jimmy, you're different from the rest. I'd do anything for you. Thank you very much. I am a woman. I used to live here. I love it. It's so European. Wow... Don't. Strangers live there now. In this house I was happy. Dad and his Harley-Davidson. Mom, Jimmy, me. The 4 of us. We were the only ones in the neighborhood who had a TV and expensive clothes. See my point? No money, no life. The Mekong... Can people here freely enter Laos? Yes. Many Laos used to live in the area. Not in these houses. People from Laos were poor and left. There's one at Smile Bar. Paj, remember? The girl? She's a Hmong, a Lao tribe. Many Hmong refugees came here long ago. Look! I used to swim there with Dad. But you can't swim! You know nothing so I'll tell you. Phaya Nak is in this river. When I was a kid I was playing in the river And Phaya Nak came up close to me. Since then I'm scared of water. It's in there? That's right. During the war, the Americans caught Phaya Nak. That's why America lost. That's what Dad used to say. He said that? And he smiled. That's Phaya Nak. A long time ago, Phaya Nak.. What's it in Japanese? Slither? Phaya Nak slithered, leaving a trail. That became the Mekong. Phaya Nak wanted to be a monk. To be a human man. It asked Buddha but was denied. That's why I want Jimmy to be a monk. Saaw can go to Phuket and wait on tables for a while. The tourists are rich. But I want my girl to go to high school. She'll be fine. I skipped school and went to Thaniya. It's an opportunity. Sis, I borrowed a car! Let's go! It's been 2 years since you went away I heard that your parents had sold you My heart aches but I must endure it It's all because of poverty From Chiang Rai to Sungai Kolok She'll be a whore I'm waiting To buy you back and set you free I have no TV or fridge But so what? They're overvalued anyway I decided to leave them behind We'll grow rice and we'll be all right Hey, pay money! You know she's working in this bar so you have to pay! I've told you that many times. Why should I pay for a girl I met on the way? Is there no free love in this country? With no money there's no love. You fuckers don't understand the ways of women's rights. You try to blag it with logic. The truth is you have no money. Right? Go back to France! Not to that motherfucking country. Let me tell you something. Here, it was Indochina. A French colony. Besides that, the region was full of American bases. And now... this is it. Nothing has changed. He's crazy Natalie come on! You're crazy coming from the Great British Empire. To do what, fuckers? Why are you jabbering on in English? You speak English too! Tunisia, Madagascar, Cambodia, Laos... I've been to places. But I was just going around our old colonies. They were paradise but when you try to own it you lose it, fucking hell! Let's go drink Laos beer, OK? Oh, step, two, three, four took us here. Hey, Charles! Charles. Vang Vieng was crazy And the mushrooms were magic! What is it? Off I go. I won't be long. Then we'll go back to Bangkok. Okay. I'll sort things out here. Good. A good luck charm for your safe return. On our way back to Bangkok I want to stop somewhere. Where? At my favorite temple. OK, we'll drop by on our way back. Call me from Laos. OK, I'll call you. See you soon. Ah, the stench of the night Overpowers the smell of fish It overcomes all people everywhere in Bangkok The night tribe has the stench of sex Youngsters smell it Intoxicated and dazed Exhilarated by and addicted to a woman's scent From a wide open mouth rises a carnal stench Of all the words spoken "sex" is talked about Of every word written brothels will be a topic Ah! Thailand corrupts like the old Roman Empire Like fire it swallows citizens lost in lust It destroys debaucherous Rome A millennia later their shame still remains Ah! Thailand, the country where goodwill shines like gold The evil stench of sex highlights the darkness and gold You know I hate Japanese men. They book and never turn up. I had this asshole once. He was a control freak. He was determined to kiss me. The douchebag don't love him so why would I? Not his stinking mouth. They think they can do anything and ignore our feelings. So selfish. I have a story, too. One client had bad breath and wouldn't shower. He refused. I'll sleep. He was sweaty. I know how you feel. Oh, I hate Japanese men. - Me too. - You think he'll sleep? No way. With all that ice he can't. Right. He annoys me. Me too. I'm bored. Wanna hear about a horrible client I had? Go on. He was loaded but he beat me! Really? What did you do? I just acted normal. hat else could I do? couldn't! Why did he do it? He misunderstood me. He thought I insulted him. He was dumb. I got really pissed off! I had a guy like that too. I didn't let it go. I said, "You paid to date me." "But what you did is wrong!" Japanese men are horrible. They're arrogant. Bing loves women. He only hangs around Luck because she's rich. I know. Why are men disgusting? I'm worried about Luck. I know, he's a worry. Do something. Look here. He's pretending to sleep. How much longer will you pretend to sleep? He's texting. The police? He wouldn't. Hello? Darling? With a friend. Yes, the two of us... You saved my ass. What happened? I had too much ice. Things got weird with the girls. I pretended to sleep all night. God, it was close! And Luck? She went home. Home? Where? Nong Khai. Nong Khai? Thanks, Witto. - You saved me. - It's OK. I could tell from your text. I've done this before. I've saved many Japanese. - No big deal! - It is. I haven't seen you for ages! How are you? You don't look so good. Are you OK? You might get ill some time this year. Are you in touch with your mother? Why? You mean you didn't see Poon? Did she tell you bad things about me? Listen. Poon is really worried about you. She's concerned about your work. That's all she tells me every time. Aunt, I'm so tired. Everyone depends on you. We should be able to take care of ourselves. I can't do it alone. Saaw should help me. I know, Dear. Now listen to me. You are supporting all the family. I know how hard it is. I'll tell you the story of paradise on Earth. A woman sleeps alone and hugs herself in the hot and cold. Earth is as tiny as a tamarind leaf. The sky, stars and Moon can all be hidden with a hand. Mount Phra Sumen is rocking. You can even jump over hell. The bottom of the Mekong is dry as a desert Your soul gets blown away like a cotton thread So listen very carefully to what I say Listen carefully, young lady The young heart tends to fly It tries to fly on its own Make sure you don't forget this Women are bound to follow traditions That's what women do So you might as well comb your hair straight And dress in Sinh so neat and proper The way for a woman to live is like a snow white heron who hasn't learned to fly You heard my lam. Follow my preaching. Don't you be a woman who betrays others. Don't be stubborn. Just remember to be a decent human being. Can't you hear me, Ying? Go buy some cola now! What are you waiting for? Here's money! Do as I say or else... Go on now! Japanese are as bad as farang. Carl says he loves me but he doesn't know what love is. When I first met that Ozawa I thought he was better. He hasn't called? Once. When he arrived at the Vientiane hotel. What can he do? There's no Wifi. You can only wait. It's been 2 weeks Maybe something happened to him? He would contact someone in that case. He hasn't read any of my messages. My German boyfriend's coming over. So ll be busy next month. I'm a boy magnet. He'll visit a few places get drunk and fool around with girls and go. Ying, can you come? I heard screaming when I walked past Poon's house. Have you visited your mom? That doesn't sound good. Poor little Ying! You have to go! It's your sister. - How are you? - Good. You've grown! - I got you a hair clip. - Cute! Here, let me. You're so pretty! Thank you. - lt's perfect. - You love your sister? You and Jimmy can live with us. There are cousins of your age. You can play every day. - Right? - OK. Ying? Get back in here! Thank you, big sister. When do you go back to Bangkok? Buy me a motorbike, Ying. Mine's old. Can it be fixed? Kin said I need a new one. OK, wait until next month. Isn't your man coming back? don't care. Can we talk, Ying? I'll enlist. I won't be a monk. If that's your choice. So you prefer the army? You mean, it's OK? Be good while I'm away. Listen to your grandmother. Aunt Phu. Thank you, Ying. Sorry I can't come to your son's ordination. I'm going back. It's OK, never mind. I'm so proud he'll be a monk! Have yourself a boy baby! Sure. And, oh! Can you set up the Phuket job for Saaw? - It's not a bad deal. - Right. Maybe we can look for him? Vientiane is small... I don't care about him anymore. You're stubborn. About your mom too. Nobody needs me. Nobody. I know now. Stay in Nong Khai. The Golden Isan country will save your soul. It's Phaya Nak! Where? - I can't see it. - It's coming at us! Where? Do you have a gun? What? - Do you have a gun? - Gun? Of course I don't have a gun. Sorry we scared you. The truth is we've been watching you. A few days ago, a Japanese man caused some trouble. He's a yakuza. We had to take him in. You get it? You don't? Maybe you were sent... by Tomioka? Yes. I'm Ozawa. He's cool. It's OK. I'm Kogami. Sorry, man. We should have picked you up in Vientiane but we couldn't. So you came to Vang Vieng. Sorry. I'll introduce my crew. This is Raynoa. And he's O.G. Sacred. From Tondo, Manila. And he is Young-G from Japan. Cheers. And this here is Monkey Monk. Of course, from Vang Vieng. Welcome to fuckin' Vang Vieng! Me and Young-G were born in a small local town named Ichinomiya. The peach region There're pretty much only orchards. In the spring you have all peach blossom It's so fucking beautiful! Togenkyo. You know, the paradise of peach blossom. It's in a Chinese legend. Once you leave the Togenkyo you'll never find it. Is that right, Mr. Ozawa? But today no one cares about the peaches. Everyone's left because they all want money. The oldies who live there will die. The orchards will disappear and become all jungle. Again, like before. And then us. we'll start our revolution from the jungle. Exactly. Did you know Tondo in Manila? It's the biggest slum in the whole southeast Asia. It's still spreading today. One of these days it'll, spread so much that it'll swallow up Manila. And us, the Tondo Tribe. And, us, the Tondo Tribe. The moment we've been waiting for is coming soon. You know, all artists and revolutionaries in the Philippines are from Tondo. I do my best to write to show we can unite I'm a Filipino trying hard someday we'll find To be one of the best one of the guest One of the least, one of the beast when writing a song! O. G. Sacred! The voice of Filipinos everywhere Sacred tongue, right and left hand Use a pen, brain, tongue Who's the sharpest? To open eyes is our goal We yell not for money and fame But to anchor the wandering spirit For poets music's not about speed A tongue's 'a weapon for a revolution Getting wise with each blood drop Tongues are refined reciting new poetry Yeah! You know, back in the day this place was destroyed by the Americans. Tons of bombs were dropped like rain! But nobody can make it their own. So this place never changed. Beautiful. I feel that! So, everyone! Let's go to the jungle party! Come on! Hurry up! Guys.. Are you communist guerrillas by any chance? Ozawa, you're funny. I know why you say that but no. - Hey, what's going on? - Nothing. Come to the jungle party! I'll tell you a story from deep within A story told by the earth of our homeland Tourists come and are shocked to see the holes on the uneven earth, the bomb craters Back when the Americans fought a war They dropped bombs onto this land Bombs rained down on us The bombs rained down on Laos day after day See the 3 Japanese? The middle one's the boss. The handsome ones in suits work in Bangkok. They entertain him. The boss looks rich. The fat man in the middle. That's him. The others take care of him Welcome, gentleman! Go for it! Is she new? She began last week. She's at Bangkok university. She's part time. She's too pale. She's into Moe? Moe? I am too That's funny I'm sure he's got no money We get other guys like that. What are they called? Otaku? Why is she trying to appeal to those geeks? Luck. Have you been back to Thaniya since you quit? How about wine? Here. Choose some. The restaurant the other night was bad. Is it better here? Let's see... Bangkok has better wine now. I want a restaurant just like this. European style. You do? But Luck, you can speak Japanese. How about a Japanese place? It shouldn't be in Sukhumvit. A waterfront place is good. You should look into it. Oh, my bag...! - What's up? - It was stolen! - With your 1 million yen. - You left it there? Damn... Bangkok. That's typical. Cheers! Luck, you pulled it off! I'm safe now. He's flying back. That's how a pro does it. That's an easy 800, 000 bahts! How many guys would a hooker see for that? They'd do it until they die. Why did you do that to Mr. Sasagawa? Isn't he your richest client? It's stupid! What's it to you? How about me? You didn't call me from Nong Khai. You went straight to Sasagawa. Mind your own business! Hello, Shin. Sit with us. Sit. You too, Witto. We got an unexpected windfall so we're celebrating. What happened? Can you fix me up? I'm rich. Me too, me too! - The 2, 500 deal. - What? You charged me 3,500! I won't sell it to you! I'm not a dealer! You rip off your friends - I hate guys like you! - Oh come on.. The client's waiting. Give me a break! He. has good stuff! And it's cheap. Now you made him mad. Now what? We have none left. What's this? You fucked Ling. We're over. What about you? Do you think about my feelings? I wait while you work... I have a heart and it's broken. So what if I fucked Ling once? I have a heart too. Wait, listen to me. Listen... Some Thai guys are watching me. I can hear them whispering. Can you talk to them for me? Wait, don't go. Someone's there. Luck! Luck! Hello? What? Kinjo? What? That sounds pretty bad! I'm a mess. It's kind of good timing. It's about Luck. Do you know Mr. Sasagawa? Sure. He asked me to check on Luck. It's a little awkward but. he suspects that Luck's seeing someone else. A job is a job but it puts me in a spot. Seeing I know about you and Luck. wanted to talk to you first and here you 'are... So you and Luck aren't together? I knew it.:. They are lovers... What do you mean? She tricked me too. An old client, my ass... I see. I got it. I thought you saw Ozawa and Luck's affair as a business arrangement. I see. You poor guy. Bing. I have an idea... Us Japanese should stick together, right? We can't let Asian women take advantage of us. We'll fight together, OK? Good. Can you contact Mr. Sasagawa? Right away. I'll be in touch. Have you seen Ling? I can't reach her. Has she gone? She didn't pay the no-show penalty. Forget Ling. Listen. My new profile. "Aren't I good enough?" 10 men responded in a second! Just like that? "Aren't I good enough?" I think I'll try it too. Isn't it cool? I'll change my photo too. It's exciting. Oh no! Sasagawa dumped me! Did he, really? I've had enough. Thaniya offers Japanese men fake fantasies. No Thai girls for me. Wait, not so fast. It's not like that. Congratulations! Sit down. It's not like that. This is about a new phase. You should leave Thaniya behind. How about this place? It's gaudy but it's OK. All the customers and girls are country folk. I feel healed when I see them. I want to heal them too! The girls I mean. We listen to their stories and their troubles. It happens all the time. Bangkok's full of those stories. Japanese men are so lewd. Thais, men and women, cheat on their partners. So it becomes business! I don't understand why you're so upset, Shin. Because Kinjo, that asshole... Ouch! That really hurt! Shin. Be patient and you'll make money. I'm not doing this for money! I don't understand... May I speak? Some time ago I was making more money than the Thais. Now I have no privileges so my morals became looser. Witto makes sense. But maybe I'm wrong? No, I'm the same. I'm saying something simpler. Japanese have a little more money so they treat Thais badly. The Thais see Japanese as a soft touch. Some Japanese trick other Japanese. Thai or Japanese, fuckers are fuckers. I love work for the sake of working. Work has to be fun. What I do with Shin is fun. Money follows the fun. Does Ozawa know any of this? He wouldn't have changed anyway. He's a loser... He always was. Why is he unreachable? I'll talk to Tomioka tomorrow. I don't want to! You want to turn down Mr. Miyazaki? I have him all the time so... I'll see him. Hello? Luck is ready to see you. Mr. Miyazaki. Right. Luck and Nat together? Right. Thank you for choosing us again, Mr. Miyazaki. Okay. Bye. Are you sure? Yes. I'll take all the bookings from now on. About time! So you're the new maid? Yes, Master. Come closer. Gentlemen! This calls for a toast! Mr.Horie? You're right. This is a happy occasion. With your support and cooperation the Asian Mercy Corporation project has pre-sold 80% of its products! Thailand still has a lot to explore. We confirmed that together. I'd like to propose a toast. Go ahead. I'll do the honors. To Bangkok! Banzai! Thank you! What? He hasn't even called you? Desertion! Court-martial him. Damn it! Yeah... How did a guy like that last in the army? Men like him were recruited every year. He was a pain in the butt, Shin. Platoon training is structured around the slackers Know what I mean? Collective punishment is there so one man's screw-up doesn't kill the platoon. Now you'd make a good soldier. You were a soldier, right, wise guy? Come on, give me a break. You think he's still in Vientiane? Kinjo, are you going to Nong Khai? Weren't you going there by bus? Oops, I'm up early tomorrow! I have to go. You're dedicated, Kinjo! You get laid every time? Oh, sure! I go to the countryside and try girls for free before they come to Bangkok. - I see your point. - Right? Only novices pay for girls. Took me years to work out Thailand. Why's she here? Oh, Luck! Luck, what's going on? Why did you come here? Show me your phone. Right now? Why? You came while I was gone. Yes, I had an important client. Right? I went straight home after we ate Your phone, now! "I want to see you." "And get dirty with you, New Honey." What's this? - Sabaidi. - Hello. What happened? Why you come here too late? Ying's gone Bangkok already. She not wait for you. Can I have a drink? Sure, why not? This is Smile Bar. I'm going back to Bangkok. I just came to say hi. Okay. Everybody, where? Oh, I don't know where everybody go. Everybody go already. I don't know. And the French guy? Oh, him too horrible! Him try to touch Paj but Paj not like. Now him leave. If I can marry him I go stay in France with him. Hello! Ozawa! Why are you here? Kinjo? What are you carrying? I'm on a bus trip. You got Tomioka worried. You met some girl in Vientiane? No, no. How are you doing? I'm having a dry spell. No bites. Is my look old? I'm not cool enough. 2 days on the bus gave me a backache. I'll fly back. Got a minute? The girls in the brothels around here are from Laos. They would be. You know nothing. OK, I'll tell you. Forget the girls in Vientiane. The ones here are easy to deal with. They're teens! Wanna try? Lao girls are innocent. They'll like you. You just play dumb with them. There's one by the bridge. Don't be shy. Pretend we don't know each other. Nobody will see you. I'm going back to Bangkok. Alright. They're cheap... I'll go get myself healed by Lao teens. Kinjo! You're lucky you're Japanese. So true. Aren't we lucky! Good luck! Shoot to kill. Honey, wake up. Don't worry... War is over... You hear me? I can see everything. All the evil spirits. It stinks! Like dead fish! Did you know Rabbit bought a house? Yeah! I've been invited. It's a mansion near Don Muang Airport. - There's a swimming pool. - Great! I should have saved up too. It takes time. You know, Rabbit is 43. We have time. Take any client, save up and get a house. Nat is right. We should save up. I'll save up and get a house. I'm much younger than Rabbit. I can do it. No problem! We'll make it! Go for it! "Aren't I good enough?" Dien Bien Phu? Where is it? In Vietnam. Vietnam? So you didn't do the job? Uh, well.. Wow. Nong Khai, Vang Vieng, Dien Bien Phu. Did you have a nice trip? I first went to Cambodia on PKO. Why do I feel so at home in Cambodia? There are landmines and people dying every day.. It's weird to say this but it's like paradise. It's all about the girl you wanted to save but couldn't! I had a revelation during this trip. I realized I'd been deceived. About what? Muang Sawan Paradise on Earth. What? I think I can understand you. It's over my head. I think you're right. You two are high. So you're serious about Luck? I don't know why I'm saying this but I bet Luck wanted a life with you in Nong Khai. The customers are bastards but it's life or death for the girls. For all the girls. So it has to be... Why don't we dance? Okay! Kai, thanks for coming! We'll drink all night! I love you, guys. Hey, you could be a madam. There's a bar run by white guys in Pattaya. It's busy even in the daytime. How about we go to Pattaya? You'll lose your Bangkok house soon. We'll get rich. It's guaranteed. But I've never... I've never left Bangkok, OK? What do you want me to do? And my family? Ling, you can sing! On stage with a band. Europeans will love it! Can I really sing? I'll practice English songs. The Carpenters! Evening, Sisters! want a good time. Got any Ecstasy? Yes, me too! Gimme some! Look at her. So rustic. She's from Nong Khai. You mean, she's Lao? Yeah. Nancy, you can move in with me. I be moving so you can help me. Thank you, Ying. Are you OK? You look pale. Nancy, you're in Bangkok. Not Nong Khai. And you'll be working here. I'll teach you Japanese. By the way... How's Apple doing? I have something to tell you. Don't panic, OK? Apple has contracted HIV. So she quit Smile Bar. She needs medicine so that she won't get AIDS She needs money That's why I came here to work. Hello? Hello, Luck? Are you there? I finally realized! I won't buy you. I won't ever buy you, Luck Hello? Hello! A client? Hello? Nancy visited me. Are you OK? Yes, she told me. You saw the doctor? Take it easy. Come on, big baby. Don't cry. You want Mommy's tit? These things happen. You know? For women like us.. Tee rak. I'm HIV positive. Women in our family.. We've always been poor. Aunts raise mothers and mothers turn tricks to raise their kids. That's how mothers meet fathers. Us girls are happy until we turn 16. Then we move to Bangkok. We work to support mothers, aunts and siblings. People hate women who chose this work. I always wish it was different. I want to feel my mother's love and my aunts'. I wanted my father to love me. Ouch...! Hey, Luck? Where are you? Luck? Hey? Hey... Oh, shit! Oh shit, this is bad... Luck! Like an angel. Luck! It's the sea. Sea. You know? The sea. Mommy! Mommy! Nice to meet you. I'm Kogami's friend. I want to buy... a gun. You're not gonna shoot yourself with my gun? Of course not. - You have cash? - Yes Alright, follow me. I've got some .45s. Do you have any 9 mms? You're Japanese, right? - You know how to shoot a gun? - Sure. I was in the army too. Don't you know? Japan Self-Defense Force. So you were. 9 mms of my day were .45s. Vietnam... I went to Dien Bien Phu. In the Marine Corps we went back to the .45. Good! Take the .45. .45 please. How much? Hi, gentlemen! We have 50 girls tonight! How's that? Sorry, we have a place in mind. Maybe next time! See you again! This suits you! - Cool! - Yeah! - Shin! - How's he doing? He's doing fine. Right? - For last night. - Thanks! Get me many clients. - Sure thing. - Way to go! There's some! Girls, go for it! See you, Shin! Let me tell you about Kinjo. Witto told immigration so Kinjo can't enter Thailand for 10 years. And Shin, you did nothing as usual. did everything! We've got to go. I told you I'm the brains and you're the brawn! We have 50 girls tonight. With some new girls. Adam? Ozawa! Jum reap sour! Hello to you too! I haven't seen-you for 20 years! You're in Bangkok! What are you doing here? I'm a priest, man! Ying? Ying? The sky! The sky in a million hues The scent of flowers at dusk The light is dimming with the sun hidden behind the sky's edge I became lonelier and lonelier At twilight the sky over the Mekong is slowly turning red The distant kehn music sounds like your whispers of love I hit the water like a drum It makes a melancholy sound I put my love on the sound and put it on the river Writing on the river the wish you'll return someday Hit the water, toum toen, toum toe toen The spash of the water Hit the water until the day he returns to me You don't seem to belong to any man So I'll try to make you look at me Do you have a boyfriend? Maybe you don't want one? Standing next to the flowers You're more beautiful With your long raven hair in braids Come and dance with me Please dance with me Dance with me like a radiant flower Come and dance with me Dance with me like a radiant flower Your posture's like a swan Isan Lam Plearn So radiant and delicate Directed by Katsuya Tomita Subtitles by Dean Shimauchi C I N E C I M
