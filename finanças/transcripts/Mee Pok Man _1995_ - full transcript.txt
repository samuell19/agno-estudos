Mee Pok one, more chilli! Are you on drugs? You said you were going to stop you can't stop doing drugs can you. I feel good. Why don't you drug yourself to death? Damn hot, watch it, sorry doesn't mean anything. You dumb idiot, why don't you die?! This is flesh, it's painful! Sophia he didn't mean it. Mee Pok no chilli. Dumb fool. Hey, I think he likes you. Your complexion looks really bad. Better take care of it. You should have seen my last customer he's a real handsome guy. Oh very handsome? Very handsome. Did you give him a freebie? Please, he's not my type. Have you seen my boyfriend? Hey what do you think of him. Do you like him to be your boyfriend? Not bad, huh. You get to eat free mee pok. Don't be so mean he's a poor bugger trying to make a living. What is he... an idiot? I heard that he's been like that since his dad died, poor thing. Poor thing! Poor thing ah! Why don't you support him. Please lah! I don't have the time, I'm supporting the orphanage. You support the orphanage? Your pussy is so loose that a lorry is able to make a U-turn! You go to the orphanage to craddla snatch? Have you all seen my boyfriend Jonathan Reeves? He's a famous photographer. Wake up! Look at her, she's passing out. Leave her alone. Hey, are you all right? I've something to tell you. Know what Ah Chai told me? He said that she falls asleep while having sex. I wasn't sleeping! Don't worry. You don't have to explain. Go ahead and sleep! Did Mike Kor send you back here? Nope. He told me to come here by myself. He said it's Friday, there'll be many booking. What do you say if the idiotic Mee Pok Man wants to book you tonight? Would you want him? Don't be so disgusting. I'm not even sure if he's aware of such thing. What a total moron! How's the noodles? How's the noodles? Hey! give it to me. I'm so sick of your drugged out face! Hey, a lot of booking tonight. Move your ass and get to work. Hey, what about me? Just wait for the cops to nab you! Bunny, you're the best. You don't give me any problems. The customers all like you. How's your whore business? Making money? Hey, how are things? Ok! - Closing up for the day? - Yes. About the money I borrowed, I'll pay you next week. How about that? Ok. Lending me another 200 $ bucks, any problem? Alright, alright. Tonight, your business is good, huh. Consider good already. Not bad, not bad. Just fork over the 200 $. Hurry up. Enough? - Only 150 $. - Not enough, you promised 200 $. Look, you have more than enough. Ok, 200 $. Alright, ok, ok. Hi, Xiaoming. You called to tell me that it's pointless to live on. But I feel that you're feeling this way because of exam stress. But don't forget that this is what everyone has to go through. I know, but I really can't take it anymore. There's too much stress over the exam. I can't take it. Xiaoming, I know that exams are very stressful. I've been thru' it too. But if only you would try to adapt and face it. You also have to bear in mind that in our realistic and pragmatic world. Only the toughest will survive. But, I really can't take it! Xiaoming, I'm sure you can pull it through. You have to face up to the stress and convert it to strength. Ok, shall we discuss till here today. I have to take another caller for our prize-winning contest. Hope to hear favourably from you soon. Alright, I'll see you in hell. I think that heaven is a better place. I shall dedicate this track "Happy Heaven" to you. and all those who are going through the stress of exams. Hey, mister, your luck doesn't look too good. Do you have any problems? Would you like to share with me? Ok. Is it woman, money or what is it. Will you tell me? I think it's about a woman. What is it about the woman? What are you working as? I, I'm operating a stall, selling Fish ball noodle. So do you know this woman? Yes, I do. So, now you're selling fish ball noodles. What about the woman, what does she do? She's er a top. Top-level executive. So you're really fond of her, right? Yes, very. Do you know if she will be fond of you? I don't know. I'll tell your fortune and see if there's anyway I can help. Ok? All right. Don't be afraid. It's ok. Fate's constellation is arranged by divine consent. Now it's time to return to one's source. If you meet your helper, your obstacles will be overcome. You can pursue her, but are you aware if she loves you? I don't know. You really like her, don't you? Very. I'll think of a way to help you, alright? I'll give you a good-luck charm to wear. You should be gentle to her, give her a good impression. As for yourself, you should take it easy and evaluate for yourself. Don't keep sulking, fretting, no one would fall for you that way. Understand? Wear the charm, smile when talking to her. So she'll have a good impression of you. Then you can live happily ever after. Ok? Alright. Here, this is the happy charm that'll bring you love. But you must open yourself up. Speak gently to her and you shall succeed. Do you understand? Thank you. Good. You need to take it slowly and be gentle and she will feel for you. - Alright. - Thank you. Time to eat lah! Still listening to your walkman. This son is useless. Always on the walkman. I'm so unlucky today, losing mahjong and everything. Tomorrow if they ask me, I wno't go gambling. You are not feeling well? Go back and sleep then. Why are you still here? Today is Saturday. Mike Kor wants me to be here. Didn't you say you were sick. Take a hike then. I didn't say I was sick I said I didn't feel well. Aiyah! Don't listen to her bullshit. She won't leave. It's Saturday nite, she'll stay to earn big bucks. What a pretentious bitch she is. I totally agree. A shit trying to act chaste! No shame! I won't stay here for long. I'm leaving soon. Really? What you gonna do next? Huh? Didn't you say you want to leave? Where do you want to go? I'm going to Europe with my boyfriend. Didn't you tell me once about the Japanese boyfriend you had? Is he going to take you to Tokyo? What happened? Why didn't you go? He's too old. What about the Indonesian Chinese. Didn't you say you were going to Jakarta with him. What happened now? He's already got Aids. Aiyoh! Too bad. That was because I didn't want that guy. This time I'll definitely leave. Aiyoh! Leave if you wish to. The more you talk, the worse it gets. You stinking bitch! You're jelous because nobody wants you! You lousy bitch, you really think you're hot stuff huh? Always putting up a false front, you think guys really want you. Ok, all right, stop it. That's enough. Don't be crazy girls. Cool it. Mike Kor, they... They what?! Nothing. Why didn't you return my page? I don't wanna work anymore. I'm leaving with my boyfriend. Who is he? Where are you going? Jonathan Reeves. He's taking me to Europe to be model. I've got something to do. I'm making a move first. Going to Europe to become a model? That's good. You don't think I'm capable? Is it hard for a guy to love me? Are you worried that he'll take me away? Wanna go? Let's go! Nothing much happened today. I guess certain things are predestined. Everything is actually fate. Is fate also dictating what is between people? Will I ever meet Mr. Right eventually. Hey, is she your girlfriend? Where do you pick her up from? She is pretty. Are you taking her somewhere for a good time? I'll recommend you a hotel that's really great. Nobody knows about this hotel except you two. Is she drunk? If she is, no problem for you. Just the two of you, nobody will know. Besides, I always take my drunk passengers there to do their business. This hotel's great, it's air-conditioned and everything, really nice place. And it's really cheap too. I always bring Indian hookers or Filipinos and Indonesians there too. They'll always ask me to bring them to this particular hotel. I like Indian and Malay hookers. They're perfect lays and they're passionate too! I shouldn't go into details. It's pretty embarassing. But you should know what I mean. Actually, Angmo chicks are not that great. Wow they really smell bad and you just won't be able to stand the bad body odour. Do you wanna check out that hotel? It's just round the corner from here. So how about it? It's not bad, really. Just the two of you. No one will know. I will just send you there. Nobody has know. Trust me, I won't tell anyone if you won't. Here we are, Jalan Ah Soo. How about it? Do you want to go to the hotel? She's my sister! Ah? She's your sister. Sorry! I thought she's a hooker you just picked up for a fuck. Uh, uh, I feel pain. It really hurts. I need someone who's able to take care of me. I don't wish to be a nobody. I want fame and money. With fame and money I'll be able to fulfil all my dreams. Most importantly. I won't need to make a life from sleazy men. I'm really exhausted. I just wish to sleep off this bad experience. Sometimes I feel that men are stupid. They're so gullible. They've always wanted me to believe how much they loved me. But I'm well aware that all their sweet words amount to nothing. Yet, they don't know that what they say is not important. I'm merely using them to achieve my wishes. Today is my day off. Yet another boring and futile day. Didn't feel like staying at home. so I took a walk in town alone. Didin't see anything I liked. So I dropped by the cafe nearby. Met him there. His name is Mike. He bought me a cup of tea and we had a chat. I'm absolutely attracted by him. Most importantly we arranged to meet again tomorrow. This is my place. It's very safe here. Don't be afraid. They won't harm you anymore. They won't. Use you anymore. I'll take care of you. Protect you. Forever protect you. Tonight I don't feel like doing anything. I shouldn't have gone with them. They were behaving like animals. I really hate men. I don't want to do it any longer. Damn bastard! Better for me to forget all about it. Now at least I can get my brother that stereo for his birthday. I feel pain. What happened? You've been knocked down by a car. Where am I? This is my place. Home. I want to go home. Ah, painful. I feel very safe. I feel safe only in my own room. Only here I find freedom. I don't have to worry about their judgement against me. That bitch Bunny didn't return call. I've told you. This kind of woman behaves like that. How to make money with a local whore? Don't make money? Try it yourself! Why are you being a wimp? Whores who give you shit should be smacked once a week. Aiyah! Forget it lah. Bunny's ran off with Angmo anyway. That's why. Local girls are such, cheap trash for the Angmos. Hey, it's only a whore. There're plenty. Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, girls everywhere. Any girl will do. But not girls with dark complexion. Can't make money from them because nobody want's to book them. Hey, check this out. I've got one Russian whore. She's as white as snow. Fuck you. If you think Angmo pussy's gold-plated, you're wrong. They really stink, man! Fuck, stinking Angmo pussies! Shut the fuck up! Good lah, get scolding! What are you doing? Go to your Angmo whore! Get lost! - Hey, closing up so early tonight? - Yeah! Did a good job cleaning it up. Are you off soon? About the money I borrowed, I'll pay you next month. Alright then. No problem? How about loaning me another 200 $? Do you have it? No. If not tonight, I'll take it tomorrow. You owe me money. You pay me first, then we'll talk. Why, what's up? Fuck, we've been pals for so long. Can't even loan me 200 $? I even knew your father, ok? Don't give me that shit! Don't wanna lend me the money? Fine, done. Better off not lending you money. Oh, shut up! Shut up. I never dreamt that my Mr. Right would turn out like Jon. Sometimes I feel that he really does care about me. Most importantly his presence brought me hope. I'm well aware that I'll never be able to leave this trade. Yet I just can't help but indulge in the dream that I could. My ultimate wish is to go to a place far off with the man who loves me. Your mee-pok tastes better. Of course. I cook fish ball noodles everyday. Of course it tastes better. Your father used to sell meepok too? Until... he passed away. He was a good man. This is actually his place. My father left home years ago. I'm the bread-winner of the family now. That's good. You're very good. At least you don't live alone unlike me. Such a loner. Have you got friends. I don't need friends. I still can get by. I prefer to lead. A quiet life. Work, come home, work, come home. Every day it's like that. Doesn't matter. And your mother? I don't know. Nobody talks to me. It's alright. I don't know. Besides knowing that I make good noodles. There're a lot people like you. Who'll patronize my stall, and eat my noodles. We'll come in a big group to give you business. But we also give you trouble. No trouble. No trouble. I'm used to it. I really like my job. Come to think of it, I'm only good at this. There're not many other things I'm good at. What do you like, then? I know. I know what I like. For the longest time, how about you, what do you like? Peace. I'd love to fly. I like to pass time, wandering around. Like taking a walk. Who are you? We're you're daughter's colleagues. - What's the matter? - Is your daughter around? - I'll come in to check it out. - I said she's not here. Hey where are you going? She's not here, you bunch of creeps. What are you looking for? Creeps. I've told you she's not in. Ask her to call Mike Kor if she comes back. Ok. Don't mess with us. Why are you so rude? Bloody creeps. I'm off to work. You got to get well soon. Have a good rest. Motherfucker! After I found I had VD. I just felt so horrible with myself. But I guess it was just a matter of time. Sometimes clients just simply refuse to wear a condom. I tried once and I was beaten up real bad. Sometimes I just want to die. Die and leave all this behind. But I can't. And the money is too good to refuse. - Have you seen Bunny? - Don't know. Whada ya mean you don't know? Don't know! You motherfucker, don't be funny with us! Don't know! You're fucking with me, huh? Fuck your mother! How dare you fuck with my boss. You little mee pok shit, want to be a smart ass! Fuck you! Get up! Let's go! I remember once in school. I saw a very frightening scene. Three or four schoolboys were fighting against one of them. They were shouting, but he kept quiet. When he fell, they started to kick him very hard. Until he finally cry out. He lift his head, not protecting himself anymore. His face was covered with blood. And he saw me. But I looked down. I couldn't do anything. I felt so helpless. But now I've forgotten who he was. Cai Hong. Cai Hong. Cai Hong. Motherfucker! Father didn't come home tonight again. I kept asking mother where he is. But she said she doesn't know. I know mother is lying to me. Recently I kept having nightmares. I think father will not ever come home. I think he's "gone". Gone like grandfather. I want to go too. But I'm scared. Dear nightbirds out there. Are you feeling lonely in the deep of night. Especially in this festive season. You really missing your loved ones right now? I'm right here waiting for you to call me. So won't you give me a buzz and I'll chat with you on the air. Hi, it's me again, Xiaoming. How are you, Xiaoming? I'm fine, since I saw your photo in a magazine. I' ve relieved all my stress. Really, congratulations! - I think I'm in love with you. - Mmmm. Really deeply in love. I've got a special gift for you as a token. What is it? You should have gotten your gift by now. It's a very adorable dead dog. Xiaoming, I should get you a gift too. Mmmm, I shall dedicate a track specially for you. It's one by Alex Toh called "Go go cats". Actually I really hate Mee Pok. I've never liked it from day one. My dad hates mee pok as well. My mother hated it so much till she left home. Actually I'm not surprised. Why you're not eating mee pok. Very pretty. You'll look very pretty with your hair curled up. You're very beautiful. You know... When I was a kid. My maths' really bad. Always. Always get zero. It doesn't matter. I can still cook fishball noodle. But, why is your hair. They're always making fun of me. Call me. An idiot. An idiot. Good-for-nothing. Do you understand? I'm useless! Hey, but it doesn't matter! You're, you're not married. So you can't wear the ring. You... Have you ever heard this song? "Do you know that I've been waiting for you". Today was the happiest day I've ever had. It was brother's birthday. Father brought us to the amusement park where he works. Then father brought us to the seaside. For a delicious seafood steamboat. For a delicious seafood steamboat. When you were beautiful. Everybody loved you. But now I still love you. I'll love you forever. Today, our teacher told us to start writing a diary. Teacher said that it will help us in the future. But, nothing happened today. I only got 30 marks in the maths test. Teacher said that I must try harder. I will try harder. I want to be a good student.
