Hello? Hello? I'm gonna hang up. Tonight on NBC nightly news, you might see a familiar face. Oh my God, Brandon? You thought I was gonna rot in jail for 30 goddamn stinking years? Where are you? Exactly where I said I'd be. You're still coming, right? Of course I am. Okay, then. We do this exactly like I said, I'll be waiting here. Oh God. Hey, Angie. You have no idea how good it is to see you. Feeling's mutual, believe me. You look like shit, little brother. Well, I feel like a million dollars. I bet you do. I brought you some clothes, some of Jerry's... Jerry? The hell you did. Cowboy-looking motherfucker's clothes ain't gonna suit me. It's a very generous donation that he made involuntarily, so try not to trash the whole damn outfit, all right? Fine, fine, I appreciate the sentiment. Damn. Your raggedy-ass self gonna have to walk, 'cause you ain't getting in my vehicle wearing no smelly-ass prison getup. You gonna make me undress out in the open? Ain't nobody looking at you. Motherfucker, shit. Be quick, though, give a motherfucker a heart attack, see you naked in the street. Ha ha motherfucker. Drive. Damn man. Anybody out here try to fuck with my wheels, I'm holding you personally responsible. Get off my back man, damn. Ain't nobody out here, Clarence, nobody been on this damn ranch since granddaddy died. Nobody but us. Hey, Angie. You positive they won't come looking for me out here? Not a chance in hell. We always said this was the perfect hideout. You'll be all right. There it is. Safe haven. Brings back all them summers we spent out here, when we were kids. Bran was too small. Nah, I remember. Well, it's falling apart, that's for damn sure. I'd say it's an upgrade, sorta. This place got dusty, real goddamn dusty. How long, exactly, is this shit gonna take Brandon? I didn't agree to no extended stay. Come on, man, you know how it is, my face will be in the papers for a week, maybe two, till they find another brother to pin all of society's problems on. Right, with all these sex cults, and blood-sucking hippies about, this shit should blow over in no time. Y'all, we can make tracks through Georgia, we can settle in Florida, they got this new attraction, Disney World. Disney World! It sounds good, right? Oh, Disney World, that's where I'd certainly hide, if I escaped from the penitentiary, and was trying to keep a low profile. Right next to Mickey. Shut the fuck up. Clarence, relax man. This shit start to fuck with my allergies, you two's on your own! Right where I left 'em. Damn. Anybody tries to fuck with us, they're gonna have another thing coming. They ain't gonna have nothing coming, 'cause they'll be dead, shit. Oh yeah. Nope, the idea is for us to stay out of jail, you ain't taken the both of us back there with you. Goddamn it, should've stashed more liquor! You can have it all man. Oh, I'm gonna. What the... Oh, real nice, leave me with the fucking peashooter. And here's Rob Robson with the latest. The state board of education meets tonight, but does not expect to act upon demands by federal civil rights officials, for desegregation of five predominantly black elementary schools. Superintendent John Hill has stated that the board will not consider another plan until a federal court rules on complaints about the board's plan to completely desegregate grades seven through twelve. Dr. Greer told NBC education reporter, Hal Williams, that more desegregation now, would pose a real political problem for local, and federal officials, wishing to... Officials at a federal prison in downtown Memphis, say they knew they had a problem when they came to work this morning and found a makeshift rope running down the side of the building. Oh, you sneaky motherfucker. A dangerous criminal is on the loose this morning, and the FBI is offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to his capture. Ten thousand. I can fucking do me with some ten thousand, shit. 24 year old Brandon Cobbs, was facing a 30 year sentence for armed robbery. A search is now under way across the state of Tennessee. Hey Brandon, you're famous, man. The beauty of the new Toyota Corona Hard Top isn't only the way it looks on the outside, inside, the all-new Corona has a rear seat that folds flat giving you six feet of space from the front seat, to the tip of the trunk, get your hands on a Toyota and you'll never let go. Being here, it's like going back 10 years, back to when we were kids. Yeah. Kinda crazy, right? Simpler times for all of us. Yeah. Sometimes it's good to get away from it, though. - Mm hmm. - Take a moment to stop, assess where you're at, you know? Yeah. I missed you, Bran. I miss our family. Yeah, me too. I was so scared for you, I know you didn't do those things they said on the TV, you just got in with the wrong crowd, we got you out now, right? You always know where I'm at, as long as you stay out of trouble, stay out of trouble... I hear you, I hear you. You can come stay with me and Jerry, you're always gonna be welcome. He don't mind you being out here? Oh, he minds, I told him I was helping Clarence for a couple of weeks. Huh. That was bad enough. If he really knew what I was doing, he would flip out. Hmm. You two going good, though? Yeah, yeah, real good, he's buying us a condo in Knoxville. Shit, that's cool. Yeah, yeah, so you got somebody? Where, back in prison? Nah, nah, I ain't got nobody out here. Sure beats being in there. You've got me and Clarence, that ain't nobody. Yeah, but you two've got things all set up, you know? You and Jerry, I ain't like that. Be like that, Bran. You busted out of jail, you're laying low, soon you're gonna have another chance at this, so don't screw it up again. You got your whole life ahead of you, just hanging by a thread, it's like you keep pulling on that thread, like you're trying to screw yourself over. Why? I don't know. Well, you got two weeks, maybe longer, to figure it out. So figure it out. Hey man, look at your drunk ass, you was dancing, huh? So, sitting around all dusty for the next few weeks, fun, fun, fun. I would do it for you, man. I don't know, this "on the run" bullshit, sounded way better in my head. You want one? Thanks, man. Tasty, huh? What's up, Clarence? Now, I don't wanna know if you did, or didn't do it, I just need you to know you ain't gonna try that shit again. A cop says something about a kid, what happened to him? You gotta put that behind you now, mistakes happen, and you learn. He ain't die or nothing. I said leave it, Brandon. Fuck man, all it was supposed to be... Hey, I said I don't wanna know about it, you're out now, that's what matters. You get back in, you do anything like that again, you'll have your sentence right here with me. I taught you better, that's for damn sure. Oh, quit acting like you dad now. Oh, I ain't dad, if he was here, he'd knocked some sense in your dumb ass, so now, you're gonna listen to me. Angela's been through enough shit, enough times, finally, she's in a great place, and it's all on us now, you especially. I'm here for her more than I am for you, remember that. Thanks brother. Jerry, he don't like me, I've done some dumb ass things that can't be undid, I know that, but you, you can do better, man. You got yourself a second chance, right here, right now. Do right by this family. Do something good with yourself. It's too late, man, I fucked up. Well, we all fuck up, nobody's perfect, so nobody's gonna take pity on you, you ain't no special case, so man the fuck up, that's all I got to say. Drink. No, let go of me, no, no, help, help! Help! No, no. No! No, stop! No, God no! No! No, please, no, no. God, no! Please God, no. Help! No, no. No! Please, let me go! No! Hey, hey, hey, hey. Run, run for your life, they'll kill you, and they'll eat you. They're sniffing us out like wild dogs, and we're the goddamn meat. Hey, wait. Shit. Angie, Angie, Angie, wake up, Angie, wake up, Angie, wake up. What? We gotta go now. - Where're Clarence's keys? - Is it the police? It ain't the damn police, where are the car keys? I don't know, look in his bag. Where the hell is Clarence? Asleep, drunk, I don't know. What's wrong, Brandon? You're scaring me. Well be scared, but just stay real quiet. What kinda hell is this? Clarence! We gotta go, come on, let's go! Who are they? Oh, shit. Come on! Brandon! Come on baby, come on, come on, don't do this to me. - What the fuck is this? - I don't know. What do you mean, you don't know? Come on, come on! Get out. No. They're gonna barbecue us, Angie, let's go, come on! Angie! Come on! Clarence. Clarence. Clarence. Fuck you, fuck you, motherfucker, fuck you. Motherfucker, where're you going? Howdy doody, thick lips. You hear that screaming on the other side of that wall there? That's your friend. Bubba's carving us up some black meat. Do you know why we eat black folk? Because Negro flesh tastes so goddamn good. You see, you dark skins have only existed to be food for the white man. My cousin Delmar, he'll tell you, it goes way back to the ancient times. You have always been our meat, so we're gonna take it back to the natural way, where you're kind ain't nothing but a food source. I said stay the hell outta here, dammit. Tasting good, Bubba. Now go back and finish him off. Stay the hell outta here. What're you tryna do, burn the whole place down? So, you like playing with fire. Let's see how much blacker we can get your balls. Yes, that's it. Yeah, nice and crisp. Just the way Jeb likes his meat. Oh no you don't. No, no, no, no... Get off me, man. That feel good, motherfucker? Shit. Ah, fuck. What took you so goddamn long? What'd they do to me, Brandon? I can't feel my arm, it's numb as hell. Fuck, Clarence. Fuck them, man. - Oh shit. - Pull yourself together, I don't need that shit. Pass me that whisky. Fuck, where's Angela? I don't know, man. We came out here 'cause of you, so you better find her, and make sure she's all right, \. Swear it, little brother. Yeah. I don't care what it takes, you just get her off this goddamn death ranch alive. I gotta get you to a hospital, man. Motherfucker, we're 50 miles away from any hospital. We're in the middle of nowhere, I'm fucking dead, man, so just leave me here to die in peace, with my goddamn whiskey. I ain't leaving you here, Clarence. I'm your big brother. You do what I fucking say, stop wasting time. Okay. All right. You want a cigarette before I go? I was trying to quit. Still trying? Keep this fucking lighter too, man, I never wanna see that shit again. Okay. Hang on, they didn't find the guns, I put 'em back in the barrel before we went to sleep. That was stupid. I could've saved your dumb ass. Well, I might've saved yours instead. Now, go and give 'em hell. I'll find Angie, and we'll come back for you. Clarence. Well, well, well, looks like I caughts me a little black baboon. Looks like you caught yourself a bullet. Get your sorry white ass against that barrel. Now! Come on, move! Against the barrel. Look at me, asshole. You can't talk to me like that, nig... I can do whatever the fuck I want. The girl I was with, where's she at? - She's dead. - Don't fuck with me! She's alive. She's alive! You better pray to God she's still alive, 'cause you'll be in a whole 'nother world of suffering if you've hurt my sister. I swear to God. Where? Sh... she's..sh... They've got her in, in the fuck pit. Go on. Some of the others don't like eating the women right away, they like to keep 'em awhile, I don't approve of it, and they like to get themselves a taste of that chocolate pussy. Where? Under the trap door, in the back. Where, motherfucker? Behind the barn, it's underground. You like human meat, you sick fuck? Here, have some of your own. Eat it! Chew it up, whitey, or I'll blow your motherfucking head off, fucking swallow that shit down, too. Stay down! Fuck pit, huh? Oh yeah, open those legs. Yeah, good. Spread those legs. Open those legs, bitch! I'm gonna give it to you, I'm gonna give it to you good. Goddamn, Cletus, you done had your turn a half hour ago, Joe Bob's next, get out! Unless you wanna see how a real man does it. Well? Dumb ass. Hey, Joe Bob, hand me that goo, this bitch dun gone dry on me. No, no! Mm, that'll do me nice. What the fuck? Where're you going Joe Bob? You wouldn't wanna miss your turn. Ah, my fucking eyes. You all right? No, no. I'm mad, Brandon. I'm really fucking mad. Clarence is dead. No, no. I couldn't save him. I got some blood on Jerry's shirt. I'll have to owe him a new one. Was it their blood? Yeah, most of it. Then Jerry won't give a damn. Hand me that fucking gun. You got any more ammunition? Yeah, plenty more. Good, they're gonna wish they never did this to us. You wanna go to the police? We can't. It's you that I'm worried for. I already lost one brother, I didn't go all through all this for nothing. Let's get crazy. He in there. Fuck! I gotta tell you something, Angie. You know that crime that you think I really didn't commit? I think I brought this whole thing down on our heads. Can't make out no other reason for this kind of punishment, I'm sorry, but, God gonna make me serve my time, one way or the other. This ain't your fault, Brandon. Yeah? Who else we out here for, huh? Who dragged you out here? Don't you be sorry, nobody deserves this. Wait right here. Hey, how many more of you out here? About a hundred. No, a thousand. Well, right now, looks like you're the only one. But they'll be here, and you'll be sorry! Maybe. But they'll be too late for you, asshole. What the fuck? Idiots! Delmar's gonna be mad as hell about this. Gimme that, gimme that. I say we go down there, and initiate a bit of coon control. Jeb? Bubba? Joe Bob? Holy shit! Looking for your friend? Fuck! Shit! Go get Delmar! Fuck! Shit! Ow, ow! Do it! Ow! Ah, my spine, my fucking spine! Ah, I can't feel my legs. My fucking spine! I can't feel my legs. You feel this, sucker? Guess you did. Other one hightailed it into the woods. Fuck! Go, I'll take care of this guy. Hmm, nothing but a pathetic little white man. Come on, do it! I ain't afraid of no black bitch! What're you doing? What're you doing? What're you doing? No! This is for Clarence. Ow! I may be a black bitch, but at least I'm the black bitch that busted your balls. Going somewhere? Come on. Fuck. We gotta move. You grab his legs. - How many of them? - I don't know. What a goddamn mess. Okay, boys, I hope y'all are hungry. Let's fix this. I ain't going in there. I said move, fucker! Angie, I want you to know something, if we get out of this alive, I'm gonna come stay with you and Jerry, in that condo in Knoxville, just for a little while, I'm gonna get me a job, a real job. And, hopefully, I can meet somebody there, she's gonna be sexy as hell, too, I'm gonna buy my own condo. You and me can be neighbors. Have you and Jerry over for dinner most weeks. How do you like the sound of that? I like all that, so shoot good, and we will make it happen. I always shoot good. Jeb, Bubba! Joe Bob! Anybody? Delmar, help me! These niggers are crazy! That you, Gator? Yeah! You all right in there? No, they ripped my goddamn nuts off! You tell them, if they come in here, I'll blow their motherfucking heads off. Your might wanna keep your distance. Shit! How many of 'em? Two, and they got guns... Shut the fuck up! Ah, everything's gonna be okay, Gator. All I gotta do is talk to these miscreants. See if we can get you out of there alive. - Nigger... - Hey, you piece of shit, my name is Brandon, and that's what I'll answer to. Nigger Brandon, you're gonna come out of there with Gator alive, and surrender yourselves. Else? We're gonna burn this barn to the goddamn ground, with you in it! Like hell you will. You've had your fun, but you're outnumbered now. Even if you got out of this, you're just two dumb black folks, nobody gives a damn about. Hell, no one's gonna believe your story. You're gonna let us go? Look, no one wants to be out here dealing with a couple of kill-crazy niggers-on-a-rampage, on their Sunday afternoons. You know that, we know it. So, if you let little Gator out of there unharmed, well, alive, we're gonna take it real easy on you darkies, hang you up on a tree branch, let you go real nice and peaceful like. Hell, I'll maybe even say a prayer. A short one. Or, you piss us off anymore, there's gonna be a lifetime of torture for you, oh, we can keep you alive for weeks, make you feel agony in parts of your body you didn't even know you had. So what do you say, Nigger Brandon? You gonna like Gator out of there, or are we gonna have to lock you down in the fuck pit, let Big Willy have his way with you for a couple of weeks? Come on, motherfuckers. Well, now? We gave 'em fair warning. Do it! Motherfucker! Go on, get in there. Delmar, you fucking asshole. Go get inside that room! Move! Angie! Fuck! Go, go! Jesus! Surprise mother... Get the fuck outta there. Hey, come on. We gotta go. Fuck, stop, just stop. Shit, Bran, we can't stop. You gotta get outta here, you gotta run. No. When he finds me, I'll put a bullet right between his eyes, but I don't want you getting killed. - Brandon! - Not for me! I'll slow you down. You gotta go get help... from somebody, anybody. I'm not going on without you... Angie! I can't. You gotta save me. It's on you. It's all on you. Brandon... Next time, be sure to check the damn place out a little more closely, before you choose it as a hideout. Go. - Go. - No. Run Angie, run! Where are you, niggers? Shit. Well, well. You killed my clan. I don't know how you've done it, but you sure are gonna suffer for it. I'll tell you how I done it, 'cause y'all are the dumbest cunts in the whole of American history. Boy, I'm gonna enjoy making you bleed.
