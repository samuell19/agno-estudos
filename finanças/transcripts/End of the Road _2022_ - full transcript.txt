Road trip? No, moving. Your card's been declined. Okay. Let's try this one. Jake, baby, please help me. Come on. Come on. Okay. Oh, did I scare you? Text me. Yeah. Bye. Just so you know, you're ruining my life. Well, thank you for sharing. Where's your uncle? I don't know. The string I tied to him broke. Chill with the smart mouth, okay? Whoo! Told you. Right on time. Y'all ready? Come on. Let's ride. Let's make some miles. - What y'all waiting on? - Where you been? I was just saying some last-minute goodbyes. Really? 'Cause you smell like you've been smoking weed. What? You tripping. That's my new body spray. - Turn out your pocket. - Hey! What is this? TSA? Come on. I ain't getting on no plane. And body search is a violation of my basic human rights. Reggie, you promised. No drugs and no weed for the entire trip. And I intend to honor that pledge. - Mmm-hmm. - I do. You better. Entire trip? Entire. Entire trip. Good thing the trip ain't started yet. Boo! Cameron, the train's leaving the station in two minutes. - I'm not going. - I'm sorry to hear that. I guess you're moving in with the next family that lives here? What if they don't like stinky-head boy smell? I'll sleep in Dad's bed. They're picking it up in 20 minutes. Whatever. Come on, little man. We got to go. Yo, Reg. - Hey. - Come on, just give me a hit. Now what kind of uncle shares a joint with his teenage niece? The kind sitting right in front of me. One and done. Thank you. Puff and pass. I assume you're bringing a back-up supply. No, it's my last jay until we get to Houston. Promised your mom. You, being a man of your word? Don't be giving me no attitude, okay? And don't be giving it to your mom. Why? It's her fault we have to move. Nah. Nah. Listen, shit happens, Kelly. Ever since your dad died, your mom's been doing everything in her power to hold this family together. She's paying for all this... It just got to be too much. Nothing feels right without him. I know. - Hey, Ma. - Hey, baby. How you doing? - Y'all on the road yet? - No, not yet. Just, um... taking one last look around the house before we go. - How long's the drive? - Three days. I figured two nights on the road. Be at your place, uh, probably by Friday. Call me if you need anything. - Yeah, I'll call you on the way. - Travel safe. - Mmm-hmm. - I love you. - Yeah, I love you too. - Bye, baby. Bye. Cam, come on! Get your scrawny butt out here. Now, we not stopping between here and Arizona. - So if you got to go, now is the time. - Mom, can we just leave? Come on, you know the drill. Come on, y'all. Come on. Bring it in, let's get together. Do we have to? If you don't act like family, I will leave you behind. Promise? Come on. Don't. Don't. Don't. Heavenly Father... please bless and protect us on our journey to our new life. In your name, we pray. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. Amen. Amen. Do we have to go? Yes. Please tell Señor Cross we are grateful for his assistance. Mr. Cross will be happy to see this. We take all the risk, Mr. Cross gets to keep all the profit. Seem fair to you? You don't like the arrangement, talk to Mr. Cross. Otherwise, shut the fuck up, bro. Whoo! You do this and you're a dead man. Mr. Cross gonna... Fuck Mr. Cross. Yo. What? Police? Where we at? - Are we there? - Mom, what's wrong? Nobody has said a word in three and a half hours. Oh, hell no. Okay, and? And I was hoping we could be like other families and converse. You know, talk. - No. - Why? Because that's what families do on car trips. Yeah, I know, right? It's crazy. But people joke, they sing songs. They... play car games. No, that's what they do in the movies. Yeah, uh, Mom, I think you've mistaken this for 1983. That's it. Everybody put your phones away. I'm serious. God! Mom... Really? Let me explain. That phone? It's a privilege, Kelly. Don't give me a reason to take it away. Fine. Okay. Let's have a conv... I'm sorry. My bad. Who wants to go first? Okay, I'll start. There you go, my man. All right, go, Cam. My declarative statement is moving to Texas sucks. I agree. Look at that! End of conversation, right? - That's right. - You got that. Whatever. Bunch of lightweights. You know how many times I had to move growing up? - 27. - 27 different military bases in 17 years. Yes, Mom, we know. - Your dad was an army colonel. - But he was a great dad. He taught us how to hunt, how to shoot, how to fight, and when not to. All facts. Especially for you. Hey, look. I know how you feel. Whenever my dad asked us to move, I got angry too. Question is, do any Black people live in Houston or will it just be us? Do any Black people live in Houston? What? You ain't heard of Megan Thee Stallion? Yes, you have. I know you have. - How about Destiny's Child? - Who was they? - Willie D! - Scarface. Scarface, see? Geto Boys. - I don't know them. - Come on. Who are those people? - You need to study hip-hop. Anyway... - Too young for that. There are a lot of Black people in Houston. Whoa, hey. Wait, wait, wait. Sis, sis. Eyes ahead. Eyes ahead. Slow down. Slow down. Okay. What is this? Looks like a detour. - Ah, what the hell is this? - Slow down, please. "Detour, next 85 miles." Go over by the shoulder. This is gonna cost us some time. Knew I should a brought my weed. This is some serious Area 51 shit out here. Y'all know what happens next, right? The car's gonna stall out, then we'll get hit by a tractor beam, and lifted up in a UFO. Oh, my God. Next, we'll be strapped down on our stomachs with big-eyed aliens probing our ass. - They won't do that to you, Uncle Reggie. - Why not? 'Cause the aliens only want to study intelligent life-forms. - Hear what I'm saying? - Ooh! Burn! You know what? Because you're my nephew, I'll let that slide. Bren, he's too smart for his own good. - What you gonna do with this brain power? - Tell me about it. Intelligence can be such a burden sometimes. Yeah. Especially to the people around you. Wait, wait, wait. Is this Throw Shade at Reggie Day? Y'all ganging up on me. - No, sir. - Listen. That's it. No more Snickers for none of y'all. - Hey! - I'm sorry! - No. Hell nah. - Listen. - No. - You know we love you. Okay? - You're our teddy bear. - Get off. Get off me. Whatever. I just ain't lived up to my full potential yet. One day, I'm going to surprise every damn body. Even myself. You get detoured off the interstate? Mmm-hmm. You intend to stop and stay around here? Why, is that a problem? No, ma'am, not for me. - Hey, Mom, can I have a Red Bull? - No. We're leaving. What? Why? What is the rush? Mom! How many dead bugs did I find on the windshield? Guess. Oh! Just... throw that away. Go get in the car right now. What the hell? Bitch! - Reggie, wake up. - Open up, I'm right here. Pull over. Come on, get out. Sis, what you do to piss the good old boys off, huh? Eyes forward, just ignore 'em. ...like you can't see me. I'm right here. - What do they want? - I don't know. Don't worry. Whoa! - You're kidding me. - What the hell? - It's my fault, I'm sorry. - What are you talking about? They were... They were hitting on me at the gas station and being nasty, so I gave 'em the finger. Girl, are you stupid? Why would you do that? Didn't you see where we were? Hey! Ow! I swear to God... Bitch! They're gone, it's fine. Kelly, don't you ever do that again. - I know. - It's a different world out here. Okay, okay, I know. Sorry. Oh, hell no. Mom, what's going on? I don't know, but we're not waiting to find out. Oh, they playing games. Move, damn it! Ah, shit. Yeah, we in it now. Reggie, stay in the car. Hell, I won't stay in the car and let these lanky-ass white boys start shit. - Please, let me handle it. - Hell no. There's not a lot I do well, but this, I do damn well. No! You explode, then they react? Then what's gonna happen to my... Please. I can't take that risk. Please. You want me to call 911? No. No. Your mom is going to handle it. Please move your truck, and let us go by. You could a killed us, lady. You endangered our lives. - Oh, hell no. - Reggie. Okay, boys. You've had your fun. Now what do I have to do to get you to move that truck? Apology'd be nice. Okay, fine. I apologize. We good? You can't just say it. You got to mean it. Unless you want us to make your whole family apologize. - Don't you come near my family. - Then say it like you mean it. I apologize... for endangering your lives. Our white lives. - Your white... - Louder. I apologize... for endangering... your white lives. Apology accepted. See how easy that was? Oh, lady, you know we was just fucking with you. What, Reggie, you got something to say? You got a comment now that it's all over? Nah, I'm good. Anybody else? - Uh, Mom... - What? We can make it to Tucson by seven o'clock. Tuscon? Yeah, it's two hours and ten minutes. I'll find us a motel. Cheapest one. We on a budget. You all right? - Mmm. - Mmm-hmm. Yeah. - What you know about this? - I like this song. - Mom? - Mmm-hmm? Those guys today, were they going to hurt us? I don't think so. They were mean, stupid white boys doing what mean, stupid white boys do. Are we homeless people? What? 'Cause technically, we don't have a home. Listen, little man. It's not your job to worry about things like that. It's your job to be a kid and it's my job to be your mom, and make sure that you and your sister are taken care of. Okay? Will we ever have a home again? We will. But, you know, a house ain't a home. Home is us. You, Kelly, Reggie, me. As long as we're together, none of us are ever homeless. I miss Dad. Hey, come here. I know. Come on. Come here, son. It's okay, it's all right. I know. We all miss him too. It's all right. I hate this. Can I just sleep in the car or something? No. Why? Look, this room is ugly and there's zero privacy. - She wants to Face Time Zac and be kissy. - Shut it, pipsqueak. - Mom, she called me a pipsqueak. - Yeah, you are. You're, like, half the size you should be at your age. - You too! - You're smaller than me! Okay, enough! - Chubby cheeks. - No, I'm not! Y'all are getting on my last nerve. Whoo! Family announcement. Nobody, I mean, nobody go in that bathroom for at least two hours. Probably smart to wear a Hazmat suit too. Just a fair warning. Do I look lighter? You know what? Everybody just get some sleep. We got a long day ahead of us on the road tomorrow. Yeah, like I'll sleep when Reggie starts snoring. - Hey! You know I don't snore. - And Kim Kardashian's butt is real. Uncle Reggie, on the Richter scale, you're an 8.5. - You know y'all are adopted, right? - What? Okay, enough. Get some sleep. - Good night. - G'night. What the... - You fools! - Oh, oh, oh! No. No! Oh, we throwing stuff? You want some too, sis? What? You don't want none of this. You want some? Hey, chill. Shh! Uh-oh. Okay, let's just go back to sleep. - Okay. - We don't want to get kicked out. - Here. - You gonna get it now. - Boy, if you don't go to sleep... - Okay. Mom, what was that? That sounded like it came from next door. What the hell is going on? Somebody throwing a party or something? - It's four in the morning, Reg. - That's when the best parties get started. - No, no, no, this sounds like a fight. - What? I'm calling the front office. - That definitely ain't no party. - I'm scared. I'm not letting this go on. - What? - Mom, please don't go out there. I'm a ER nurse. For all we know, some woman is getting beat by a man. You gonna get caught in the middle? - Mom, no. - Sis... The fuck? Mom? - Mom, who is that? - Shh! Sounds like he's gone. I know a gunshot when I hear one. That was definitely a gunshot. - Somebody could be dead in there. - I better check. Cam, stay here. - But... - Stay here. Damn. Kelly, call 911. There's a man with a gunshot wound to the throat. - What? - Keep your brother in that room! Bren, wait! Be careful. No time, he's gonna bleed out. Sir? Sir, I'm a nurse. My name is Brenda, I'm gonna help you. It's okay. It's okay. Reg, go to the bathroom, get me some more towels. Now! Just stay calm. I've called 911. Help is on the way. I'll take care of you. Hurry up, Reggie! Just hold on. All right, just hang on. Hang on. Hang on! Sir, you're going to be okay. Stay with me. Stay with me. Look at me! Look at me, sir. Come on. Hang on! Damn. Jake, please. Please help me through this. I need you. Captain Hammers, sir. Son. We haven't touched anything. We waited for you. Okay, then, let's see what we got. The witnesses next door reported a fight. Harvey Ruck. Enforcer and bag man for Mr. Cross. An informant of mine says that Ruck and his partner Pepe Ochoa were supposed to deliver a payoff to Mr. Cross from the Sinaloa Cartel. Looks like Ruck went independent, canceled Pepe's ticket. Took off with the loot. Do you think the cartel caught him? We didn't find any money. Reasonable assumption, or Cross did it. Man's had his hand in every dirty deal that ever went down in this part of the world. I've been chasing that slippery son of a bitch for years. I'll bring him down. Just a matter of time. Used a nine millimeter. I want to talk to the folks staying next door. Nice family of four. I let them go, sir. Let 'em go? Yes, sir, just before you arrived. But I got their statements. Son... ...how many murders have you investigated? One. Ah. If that family can ID the killer's voice, then they are in danger. And you'll have four more murders on your conscience. I need to talk to that family. How come Reggie gets to drive and I don't? Because you only have a learner's permit for California. Reggie probably doesn't even have a license. What? Hold... Hold... Hold on. I got plenty of licenses. - Plenty? - Okay? - Are they valid? - Yes. I don't know what you talking about. Hello. Brenda Freeman? Yes, who's this? Mrs. Freeman, I'm Capt. JD Hammers of the Arizona State Troopers. I'm in command of the homicide investigation at the Sunset Motel. It appears I missed you by a minute. I need you to come back. I'm sorry, Captain. I just want to get my family as far away from that motel as possible. Don't blame you, Mrs. Freeman. It was a gruesome thing you witnessed. If you pull over, I'll meet you somewhere. I need to ask you some follow-up questions. I told your officers everything. Yes, ma'am. But... - Look, Captain... - ...I can't talk right now. I have your number. I promise I'll call you as soon as I can talk. - Ma'am, you don't... Ma'am! - Have a good day. Got a bad feeling about this. Mom, what was that about? We're... We're not going back, are we? Hell no. No, absolutely not. - Hello. - Hello. Who is this? We know what you did. We know what you took. - I think you got the wrong number. - Don't hang up, Brenda. - How do you know my name? - Boss man wants his money, Brenda. Excuse me? What money? You took his money and he wants it back. I don't know what you talking about. Don't call me back anymore. - What was that? - Some weird voice. Talking about how I took her money. Probably trying to scam me. I ain't got nothing for 'em to scam. I mean, think about it, double-quarter-pound burger. That's half a pound, right? How come they ain't got the guts to call it a half-pounder? Because it's bad marketing. No. Oh, this asshole again. Don't answer it. - What's wrong? - Nothing's wrong. Uh-uh. - I know that look, little brother. - What look? Something's going on with you. You get twitchy and darty. - My eyes ain't darty. - You darty right now. Like when you got a secret or you about to tell a lie. What's up? Damn. All right. All right. All right. I was going to surprise you once we got to Houston. All my life, everybody say I'm the family fuck-up, right? - No comment. - This time, Reggie ain't the problem. Reggie's the solution. Where'd this come from? The Lord is our savior, fell out the sky right into our laps. Peep what's inside. - What the... - The dead dude. He stashed it under the bathroom sink. It's gotta be drug money, right? I figured this dude is deader than shit. He can't use this money, but I know a needy family who can. Have you lost your damn mind? Bren, the dude was dead. I mean, like his heart had stopped. I'm a nurse! I know what a dead dude is. You thought you were just gonna take this, and make our lives better? - This money could save our lives. - It can end our lives! Bren, just say thank you. Stop looking on the dark side. We could turn around and go back to Los Angeles right now. Save the house and everything. You stole money from a crime scene, Reg. The voice on the phone, he killed that man for this money. And? And their boss knows we have it. He knows who we are! Bren, you overreacting. He ain't coming back for this. What if he does? Huh? You gonna turn into some street gangster? Instead of the assistant manager at Chick-fil-A? Hey, that's an elite position. Okay? I had to work my way up to that. You know how many drug tests I had to pass? That hurt. - Okay, we gotta call the police. - What? No. You call the police, they'll arrest the whole damn family. They'll say we the ones that murdered him to rip his shit off. We are not criminals. We the next best thing. We Black. You want to risk the lives of those two kids? Here she is. - Bren, don't answer! - No, Reggie. - Don't pick it up. - Get... Reggie, get... get off! We have your money. We want to give it back. Where are you? I'm not gonna tell you that. Worried about your family? You should be. Look, you'll get your money back, but it'll be on my terms, okay? I'll call you back. I thought about what you said. You're right. You have every right to be angry. Let's just keep half the money. Yeah, in the very next room. Yeah, Zac, he was murdered. I mean, there was blood everywhere. This is our game, Brenda. You don't make the rules. Mr. Cross does. The bag is in room 33 at the Center Star Inn. It's in the closet on the top shelf. You're not hearing me. The key will be under the mat outside the door. Get your money. Let's go. Yeah, let's hurry up back on the road to nowhere. Mom, what were you doing? I was getting some tourist brochures. Check it out. We're not tourists. We're seeing a whole new part of the country. Maybe we should take advantage of it. You know, soak up some culture. Seriously? This place has culture? Look, after last night, I just think we all need to relax and breathe a little. Feel like normal people again. Ain't nothing normal about this place. Shut your ass up. Howdy, folks. Welcome to Old Bravo. The town where the Wild West never dies! Get him! Oh, no! You got me. Come on in. - Dork. - No, I'm not. - You're in jail. - What? - Yeah. - No. - You're in jail. - Oh. Brenda, you my big sister, I love you. But you definitely just messed up the best thing that ever happened to us. That money would've got rid of all our problems. All money is not good money, Reg. Whatever. That's Jake talking. You damn right that's Jake talking. You gonna bring up my dead husband? You know what? Why not? Jake was a hero, Jake was a god, 'cause Jake always did what was right. And remind me what good it did Jake when he needed chemo and radiation, didn't have the money for it. I got the money! You got the money by getting yourself so far in debt you lost your house. Let your own kids down! - You a asshole, you know that? - Yeah, I know it. I've known it my whole life. 'Cause people constantly reminding me. You know what? Maybe I am just an assistant manager at Chick-fil-A. That don't mean I don't have my own dreams too. You killed those dreams. I was just trying to make things better. That's all I was doing. You all I got, sis. I love you and those kids. You know that. I wasn't trying to hurt nobody. I know, Reg. I loved Jake too. I know. Seems like every day the man upstairs is testing us. - This is really peaceful. - Yeah. I gotta use the restroom. Uh, Reg, go with him. Mom, I'm not a little kid anymore. Okay. Come straight back. Okay. Okay. Hurry up. Hey, folks. You hear that? It's high noon. And there's a duel happening. Come on down! - Feels kind of real. - Who you got? - My man right there. - Yep. What? Last person who took Mr. Cross for a fool is dead. We want our money. The money is there. It's in the room. Then go get it. I'm not going back there. You have something of his, Brenda. And now Mr. Cross has something of yours. Bren? He's here. Cross is here. Go find Cameron. Bring him straight to the car. - Come on, we gotta go. - Whoa! - What is wrong? - Don't ask questions, just do as I say. Cam! Cam, you in there, little buddy? Come on. Come on, little man, let's boogie. We gotta roll. My bad. I'm sorry. You drop this? Oh, shit! Cam! Cam! Cam? - Are you gonna tell me what's going on? - Just Just get in the car right now. Oh, my God. Okay, I'm in. Now what? Hello, Brenda. This is Mr. Cross. He's with me. Please, just don't hurt him, okay? Call the police, or fuck with me again, and I'll grab your daughter next. Please, for the love of God, just don't do this. You have two hours to retrieve my money. Then bring it back to Old Bravo and call me. Or your son is dead. Mama! Mama! Help! - Cam? - Swear to God, if he hurts that boy... I gotta get back to that motel and get the money. Mom, what's happening? Where's Cam? - Cam has been abducted. - Abducted? Reggie will explain it to you but right now I gotta go. Go where? Where are you going? I got to get Cam, but I need to leave you here. No! No, no, no! He's my brother, I'm coming with you. Listen to me. I cannot worry about you and your brother and do this. Just wait for me, I'll call you. Mom! Mom! Don't. Mom, wait, please. - No, no, no. Come on. - Mom! I got you. I got you. - Mom! - Kelly, trust her. Mom! I'm sorry, baby. Mom! Mom! Come on, move! You better not hurt my baby. In pursuit of a speeding Chevy Suburban. Headed westbound, east of Old Bravo town. Capt. Hammers, we got a hit on your plate request coming out of Old Bravo. Driver is a female, Black. This is State Trooper Captain Hammers. She's a witness. If the cartel or Cross spot you, they'll kill her. Fall back. Do not pursue. I repeat, do not pursue. Oh, my God. "Don't worry"? The last three months of my life have felt like a bad nightmare that just keeps getting worse. I know. I can still feel him, Reggie. Like Daddy isn't dead, you know? I can hear his voice and I can see his face. And I don't... And I don't want to let that go. I don't want to lose him. Your dad is always going to be with you. You hear me? Trust that. And your mom's going to get Cam back. I promise. Reggie, come on. Please tell me what's going on. I messed up, Kelly. I messed up big-time. What? No! What? Okay. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Hey! Hey! Stop! No! Stop! Stop! Stop! No! No, please! Wait, please! No! Stop! I see you. Fuck. Thieving bitch. Stop! Stop that car! Fuck! I see you! Where you going? My bag! Give it back. Kiss my ass! Give me back my bag, you little thief! Yo! Drop the bat. Whoa. Just... Just... put that down. Shut the hell up. I'll blow your ass back to Africa. Mace! Holy shit. What do we got here? This woman here, she stole my property, but I got it back now. So I'll just go get my car and go now. I don't want any trouble. Oh, that's too bad. It looks like you got it. Look, I don't have time for this. Hey, show me what's in the bag. No. I'm leaving. Would you look at that? Mom, pick up. This is Brenda, please leave it at the tone. Mom, uh, we are at Lucky 13 restaurant, right outside of Old Bravo, okay? Can you please call me? Reggie just told me everything and I'm really scared. Begging your pardon. Would you be the Freemans? Captain Hammers of the Arizona State Troopers. I'm looking into the homicide that took place last night at the Sunset Motel. I didn't spot y'all at Old Bravo so I figured you'd be here. There's no place else to eat for miles. - Sir, we already talked to the police. - I know. Mind if I join you? Darling, bring me a big old glass of iced tea, extra sweet, lots of ice. - Thanks. - Sure, Captain. And, uh... you'd be Kelly. And you'd be the uncle. Reginald Beaumont. Hmm. Which accounts for two of you. Now, as to your mom and brother, your mom was last seen driving south of here like a bat out of hell. Where's your brother Cam? Um, he was with her, sir. Probably didn't see him because he's little for his age. Hmm. - Super sweet. - Thank you. Now, how about we cut the bullshit? There's a fortune in missing drug money. And if your mom's got it, she's in a whole world of danger. Because it either belongs to the Sinaloa Cartel, or a Mr. Cross, a man who's the most dangerous criminal in the Southwest. He's murdered at least 50 people. You want to see your mom and brother alive again? You need to tell me where they are. Or don't. It's their funeral. Reggie. Sir! Sir, wait. My brother's been kidnapped. Can you please help us? It was Mr. Cross. Please. Not so fast, bitch. Best place to lie low is my ranch. Mom should have called us by now. What? What's wrong? SUV's been trailing us for the last five miles. I slow down, he slows down. I speed up, he speeds up. You think it's Mr. Cross? I don't think he'd get his hands dirty like this. Might be one of his goons. Let's not take any chances. But I'm gonna ask you both to duck down in your seats. You can come up for air. Sorry to scare you like that, but I had to be sure. You think that dude is gonna try and smoke my sister and nephew? I'm not gonna let that happen. No! Let me go. Yo, Mace! Look who's all woke up. Look who's here. Big Mama wants some action too. - Get off of me! - Well... you know what they say? Once you go white, you ain't ever walking right. - Oh, you... - Fuck, get off of me! - Let me go. - Bitch broke my nose. Let me go or I'll snap her scrawny red neck. Do it. That's one less slut. Get the money! Get away from that! Give me back my bag. You ain't going nowhere. - No! No! Please. Please. - Get the bag! No! Son of a... - Here you go, Mace. - That's my bag. Whoa! Easy now. I need that money to get my son back. Don't give two shits about your son. Yeah, fuck her! Yeah, she won't use that gun. Oh, God! Mace, bitch shot off my leg! I missed! I was aiming for your balls. I got one more shot in this gun. Who wants it? Huh? You can't shoot us all. I won't have to. The money in that bag belongs to Mr. Cross. You heard of him? I wonder what he would do if he finds out who stole his money. Put the fucking money back in the bag. Go on, do it. - All of it. - Get it in! - Hurry up! - Do what he says. Jesus Christ. Look. There ain't no reason to tell him about all this, huh? No harm, no foul. Right? I'll think about that when I'm driving away. If Mr. Cross or any of his friends decide to show up, my wife Val is as handy with a gun as I am. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Don't worry about him. He's friendly. - I do not like dogs. - Even the teeny-weeny ones freak him out. Well, it's the teeny-weeny ones that have the sharpest bite. Go! - Hello, woman. - Hello, man. This is Kelly Freeman and her uncle Reggie. They're from California. - Ma'am. - Well, how do you do? Nice to meet you. - Hello, Kelly. - Hi. Are you hungry, child? Oh, no, thank you. We're good. Reggie, Kelly, lend me a hand, please. I had to give him a shot to put him out, so he might be groggy. Oh, fuck no! See? Boy's safe and sound. - Cam. - You dead, motherfucker. Nope. Alive and kicking. Boss man. You and your surprises. I know. I couldn't resist. Now, where's my money? Mom, uh, we are at Lucky 13 restaurant, right outside of Old Bravo, okay? Can you please call me? Reggie just told me everything and I'm really scared. Where... Where's my family? Come on. Come on, baby, pick up the phone. Pick it up. Pick it up, Kelly. Pick it up. That's her. Ah, she's probably calling to say she's got the money and is on her way. You have had one hell of a 24 hours, JD. My own damn fault. I underestimated Harvey Ruck. He didn't know I put a tracker on his car, so he wasn't hard to find. Son of a bitch was feeling brave. I had no other choice. Problem was, I had to clear out before I could find the money. Figured I'd get it when I came back in my official capacity. But now we'll get our money back from Mrs. Freeman. Oh. We will, you will. You're a good man. My good man. Love you to death. Listen to me, nothing bad is gonna happen. I will not let anything bad happen to y'all. Once your mom gets here with the money, they'll let us go. I promise. You hear me? Where's my family? We're sending you a family portrait. Don't be late. Or the throat cutting starts without you. Oh, shit. This is the trap for Mom, and he's using us as bait. We have to find a way out of here. Yeah, how? This place looks like Jigsaw's basement. What about that? Oh, God. Oh, my God! - But it's rusted shut. - Here, Kelly. - Okay, but what if they hear us upstairs? - They won't. This is housebreaking 101. Cam, hand me one of those rags over there. Good. Wrap the rag around the end of the broom. All right, take the end of it, gently press it up against the glass, directly in the middle, then give it a fast punch. Just pop it. Okay. - Go ahead. Go ahead. - Can you give me a lift? Oh, my God! It bit me. Oh, God. Shut the hell up, Cujo, before I whoop your ass! - Here. - Here, boy! Steady. Steady. Steady. He's coming. He's coming. Sorry, sorry! Here. Come on! Damn! All right. Should have warned you about my alarm dog. Got some good news though. Your mama's almost here. Y'all need to come back upstairs. Sorry you got caught in the crossfire, but soon as I get my money, you're free to go. - Just gonna let us go on our merry way? - That's right. You a goddamn liar. What did you say? You heard me, cracker. You can take this country, "aw, shucks," fake Southern hospitality bullshit, and shove it right up your tight cowboy ass. I ain't gonna let you hurt these kids. You gonna need to learn some respect, boy. Perfect. Clorox, motherfucker! JD! JD! Kelly! Damn, I thought she was a nice old lady. Reggie! Lose that knife. I said lose that knife. Well, look at you, little man. You ain't gonna shoot me. You're right. He won't. But I will. Drop the knife. We wasn't going to hurt you. Bitch, get your evil, Martha-Stewart-looking ass down them steps. Now! Bitch, get your... Girl, give me this weapon. Get our phones. Let's get the fuck out of this psycho house. Thanks, little man. Please don't die. I got you. I ain't going nowhere, okay? You hear me? I promise. I ain't going nowhere. - Okay? - Okay. Now, let's get out of here. Come on, we got to find your mom. JD, they're getting away. - Are you okay? - The little shit poured bleach in my eyes. Can you see? Good enough to hit what I aim at. Mom, come on. Pick up please. Please. Please, please, please. - Come on. - Kelly! Mom? Mommy, where are you? I think I'm almost there, but my phone is dying. I think I can hear you but I can't see you. Mom, where are you? Mom! - Cam! - Mom! Oh, my God! - Mama! - Oh, Kelly! Oh, Cam, my baby. Mom, Reggie, he kept us all safe. Thank you, Reg. Thank you for my children. They're all I got. You too, big sis. Okay, Mom, listen to me. Mr. Cross is an Arizona State Trooper. He's... He's the captain. - What? - Capt. Hammers is Mr. Cross. And he's corrupt and evil, and his crazy wife is just as bad. They were gonna kill all of us. - He's what? Where are they now? - Locked in the cellar. Well, we better move. Wait, wait, wait! What about the money? It stays to pay for our escape. Come on, sis. Hammers, Cross, whatever his name is, he's not gonna honor that deal. You know that. It stays. Tell me that's your final offer. I'll put it where the schizophrenic asshole can't miss it. Come on. Let's go. - Give me my shotgun. - Here. Go! Where are they? Look. They can't be far. Look what we got. Time to go hunting. Don't start the car until I yell. You got this, Kelly. You got this. - All right. Let's get this baby started. - Okay, Kelly, go. - Come on. - Come on, please. - Reg, you're gonna have to fix this. - I'm on it. Which way? Don't know. Lost their tracks. I think it's the fan belt. - You a smart kid, you know that? - Thanks. Become a scientist when you grow up. Help change the world for the better. - Make Uncle Reg proud. - I got you, Uncle Reg. All right, move back. Okay, start the engine. Okay. Okay, okay, okay. - Yes! - Yes! Oh! Oh... There you go. - Yes! - Yeah! We did it! Got you. Can we just keep driving until we get to Grandma's? Absolutely. We only stopping for gas. I heard that. Amen. - Oh, shit, we got company. - What? Hold her steady. Drive! - Get down! - I think I got their attention. - Oh, my God! - Take this. It's us or them. Come on, Mom. Focus and squeeze, like Grandpa taught you. Nobody messes with my family. We got a live one. Damn her! I can't see. - Yes! - Did you get 'em? - Hell yeah. - Yeah, but keep driving. Don't slow down. They're back. Oh, God! - No, no, no! - No! - Missed me, motherfucker! - Reggie, keep it steady. Bren, be careful. - Mom! - Oh, no! I got you now. Hang on, I got this. Be careful. Mom, get back! Get back! Look out! - Mom! - Mom! Stop the car! Reg, stop the car! - Mom! - No! This is my game. You broke the rules. Bye-bye. No. No. No! No! No! - Mom? - Mama! Oh, my God. All right, enough. Enough! Enough! You want me? Just take me. Take me, okay, please? Please! No, Mom, no. Like shooting fish in a barrel. - Jump, kids! Get out, now! - Cam, go! No. I make my own rules. Son of a bitch. - Hey, Mom? - Mom! Oh, baby. You're okay. It's over now. It's over now. All right. This nightmare's over. I got you. I'm never letting go. - Never. - Okay. Come on, bro. You too. You too. You know the drill. Come on. Oh, thank God. Thank you, Jake. Thank you. Reggie? Drive this car and do not stop until you hit Texas. Yeah. Thank you. Y'all enjoy it. Listen, uh, y'all ain't got to worry about the check. I got it covered. What? Come on, y'all. Dig in. And come up off this syrup, Kelly. You paying? Yes, Bren. Give me the... Tell me you didn't. Didn't what? No! I see your eyes darting. What did you do, Reggie? How much? Enough to give us a new start. That's right, and there's more where that came from. Oh, my gosh! Yeah, you know, waffles, they taste best when you load 'em with lots of syrup. And butter. Got to have butter. We gotta give that back. Give it back to who? Wait, yeah, Mom. Give it back to who? We can't exactly take out an ad. No, absolutely not. Cam, Kelly, do not look at him like that. He is not a good role model. Excuse me, I'm a great role model. We gotta give this money back to... I don't know. Somebody. Right? Mom, we're keeping it. Restitution. Looks to me like you've been outvoted, big sis. So eat. Your food's getting cold. Yeah, come on, Mom. - Join the family. - Mmm-hmm. A celebration. Come on. Just a family celebration. Pass the syrup. Thank God. Let's put this money away. We don't need no problems. Texas ain't got nothing on Arizona.
