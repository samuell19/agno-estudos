There we go. ..he's not guilty, yeah. CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICK Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to thank the jury for their decision. Thank you very much. Alex Salmond! Alex Salmond! Kirsty Wark, BBC! In March this year, former First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond left the High Court in Edinburgh, cleared of all charges of sexual misconduct. The verdict concluded one of the most dramatic trials Britain has ever seen and a tale of political intrigue and alleged crimes that has gripped me since the story first hit the headlines. 14 charges in total, one of attempted rape. The allegation is that he pushed her onto a bed, knelt over her, naked, and did attempt to rape her. I'm meeting the people who witnessed the story as it unfolded... I was stunned when I heard these. I didn't see that coming at all. I don't think he did either. ..I explore the controversial claims that this case was orchestrated at the top of the ruling party that Alex Salmond once led to stop him ever returning to politics... It's clear to me that there was a political conspiracy against Alex Salmond. There's no conspiracy. It's a heap of nonsense. ..and some of the women at the centre of the trial speak on television for the first time. It makes me feel incredibly frustrated that anyone could believe that we could possibly have anything to gain from doing this. This trial could represent a watershed moment for us all. This is the first Me Too trial, not only for Scotland, but for the whole of the United Kingdom. It's about people's lives and the way that women and men treat each other. ON RADIO: Scotland's former First Minister, Alex Salmond, is to go on trial in Edinburgh today, accused of sexual assault, including attempted rape... ON RADIO: The allegations against him date from 2008 to 2014. Mr Salmond denies 14 charges. Yesterday, a man in his 60s became the UK's third death linked to Covid-19. The Scottish Government has issued... It's a beautiful spring morning outside the High Court. It's just after eight o'clock. And inside, 15 jurors are about to hear details of alleged crimes. We know there are 14 charges. We know there are ten women. What we absolutely don't know is what the evidence is going to be on either side, and one thing's for absolute sure - it's going to be explosive. How are you doing? Good. I'm so interested to see what his demeanour will be like this morning. CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICK Without any fanfare, Alex Salmond and his office-manager sister have just gone into court - it's just about quarter past eight - like any accused going to the High Court. But no sign of his wife Moira today, who has always preferred to stay out of the public eye. Inside the High Court, the trial will be conducted by two of the most senior lawyers in Scotland. The prosecution will be led by Advocate Depute Alex Prentice QC, an understated forensic lawyer known for his meticulous approach. Alex Salmond's lead defence counsel is Gordon Jackson QC, a huge personality renowned for his oratory. He was once a Labour member of the Scottish Parliament and a political opponent of his client. The trial will be heard by Lady Dorrian, Scotland's second most senior judge. It's a very sobering experience being in court, hearing the indictments being read out to a jury - a jury of nine women and six men. This morning in court, Salmond's legal team revealed some of the substance of his defence for the first time. Alex Salmond pleaded a special defence in the case of three of the women. The contact was not sexual assault. It was consensual. Among the incidents Alex Salmond claims were consensual is one of the most serious of the charges - that of sexual assault with intent to rape. Suddenly, you think, "My goodness, "this man sitting literally 6ft in front of me "is certainly on trial for his freedom." CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICK, SHOUTING On the day Alex Salmond was first charged with 14 criminal offences, his former press adviser, Campbell Gunn, was by his side when he attended court. Your face on that day in the pictures was a very, very grave face. Yeah. Were you shocked? I was shocked at the number of offences. Alleged offences. The alleged offences. Also, I had seen the charge sheet and I saw the names of the people who were involved, and I knew most of them. I mean, it was such a massive occasion. I'd gone out previously and said to the media, "Mr Salmond will come out and make a statement, "but he won't be taking questions." I refute absolutely these allegations of criminality, and I'll defend myself to the utmost in court. And then, once he had completed that, then we struggled our way through a mass of television cameras and so on. What was he like to work for? A hard taskmaster. People have the image of him as doing, you know, the Alex Ferguson hairdryer. Bullying? Bullying. He wasn't like that at all. I mean, he could tear you off a strip if you deserved it, and usually, if he did that, you DID deserve it. He had that sense of power that he would raise an eyebrow and you knew you had to do something. How was he with people? Was he...? Did he give people personal space? Could he be touchy-feely? Was he tactile? I suppose he could be touchy-feely, but in today's circumstances, perhaps that's not a good idea. But I never had any suspicion that there was any sexual motive to anything he did. The women in the case will testify anonymously. First on the stand is a Scottish Government official known as Woman H. She's giving it from behind a screen that obscures her from Mr Salmond, who's sat in the dock. The jury can see her, but she can't be identified in public. The Crown opened with two charges relating to her, one of sexual assault, and then the most serious allegation of this whole trial, attempted rape. I listened as she told her version of what happened after a dinner at the First Minister's official residence in June 2014, just three months before the independence referendum. She spoke very calmly. I think you could have probably heard a pin drop. We were alone in Bute House. There had been alcohol. The incident happened after everyone had left. He was full-on under my shirt, touching my bra and breast. At this point, I started to feel scared. He wouldn't stop pursuing me, kissing me, touching me. He said to her, "You know, I'll be a great lover." He wanted her to stay over. And what she thought she could do was, if she agreed that she would stay over, she thought she could get out of the room, get into another room. She claims she went into the room and he came after her. He was taking my clothes off. I remember backing up against the chair, trying to duck him, swerve him being on me. I was telling him to stop the whole time. I remember feeling him on top of me, his private parts on top of mine. She felt like she was being hunted. She said she couldn't do anything about it, but then he rolled over and passed out. I made one final push to get him away over to the other side of the bed. When he was snoring, I went into the bathroom. I fell on the floor and just curled myself into the foetal position, thinking, "Be quiet. He won't hear you." She said she was scared and in shock. She waited till the coast was clear. She said she went down into the basement and went out the back door of Bute House. "I just wanted it not to have happened." And she didn't want people to think Salmond... ..that she was one of Salmond's women. I've never heard someone in court describe, in graphic detail... ..allegations of sexual assault. And perhaps because the complainer was behind a screen, you don't have, as it were, the benefit of seeing the face, but actually what that means is that you can concentrate on the words. And the words were so devastating. Raise the roof as we welcome Alex Salmond. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Alex Salmond has been a towering figure in Scottish politics throughout my career as a political journalist. Well, we're joined now by Alex Salmond in Aberdeen. Would you like to be leader of the SNP? I think that's a...that's a question for the future. Very few people in Scotland are neutral on Alex Salmond. They will either come down as a complete supporter or somebody who really, really questions him. Could you just do that and just look at the camera? I first met him when I joined the SNP in 1980, and even then, it was obvious he had some extraordinary qualities as a politician. We face a Tory government. It's a government of occupation we face in Scotland, just as surely as if they had an army at their backs. You know, I know people that absolutely love him and would worship the ground he walked on, and then I know other people of the same political persuasion who found him arrogant, smug. You know, he's very much a Marmite figure. How would I describe Alex Salmond? Erm, gregarious, interested, interesting. A tactile man. Greets people with a warm hug. A fairly unreconstructed, older Scotsman. In me, it doesn't sit easily, but it does with him, and it's very natural. We were extremely close in friendship terms. It begun to erode a bit in 1991/'92... ..because Alex had begun to show the authoritarian tendencies and the lack of dissent. What happens to the person at the centre of the cult of personality is, "I am all-powerful." You know, "I can do what I like. I am untouchable." I met him quite a few times on the campaign trail, and I remember at the time thinking he had this kind of charisma. I've also met Bill Clinton and he had a similar charisma. He kind of like was very much about, "I'm a really open, popular person." You're doing well. We're proud of you. Thank you. Really proud of you. I remember once going with him to a debate. There were times where, you know, he would, in a debate, clearly win it, but then, when the person was down, he'd keep kicking. He had a kind of pugilist air about him. They thought it was all over. Well, it isn't now. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Today, Alex Salmond's defence will cross-examine Woman H... ..but it won't be Gordon Jackson who leads, but second-in-command Shelagh McCall QC. Why didn't you tell the security guard? I was scared, embarrassed, humiliated. I wanted to get away and for it to stop. Is the truth that you weren't there at that dinner and there was no incident? I wish I wasn't there. I wish on my life that the First Minister had been a better man and I wasn't here today. What the defence was positing... ..was that Woman H wasn't even at Bute House on the night that she alleges that there was an attempted rape on her. One defence witness who knew her well testified that Woman H wasn't there that night, whilst the Crown led a witness statement suggesting she HAD been there. Shelagh McCall was going through the detail of the testimony which Woman H had given on various different police statements, and it didn't all add up to exactly the same thing. The bra was on. The bra was off. The pants were on. The pants were around her ankle. Trying to break down the detail of her story, and do it in such a way to discredit her version of events. Why did you tell the police that you had your pants on? They were there, but they weren't on. I was reliving the situation of what happened, as well. The jurors will have Lady Dorrian's words ringing in their ears, which is, you know, "You are judges. "You are not detectives. "You must approach this case on the basis of the evidence "that you hear in this courtroom and nothing else." And it's in that detail where the difference between even, you know, a conviction or not a conviction can be made. In a further twist, Alex Salmond claims he had a consensual sexual encounter with Woman H, but that it happened on a completely different date. There was an encounter in 2013 with your consent. That's not true. I've never been a willing participant in Alex Salmond's advances towards me. What's going on? He's in there shouting at his lawyers, according to the court reporter inside. Any idea what's being said? Don't know, I didn't hear him, but someone went to the loo and said they could hear him just shouting at his lawyers. Well, you know what? I think he looks a lot more disgruntled today than yesterday. So, he's not a happy man. The graphic testimony of Woman H has generated endless column inches in the press, some of it focused on her description of why she finally came forward. The First Minister was a very powerful man and I didn't want to get on the wrong side of him. I started having flashbacks around the time of the Me Too movement and the Weinstein case. I wanted it to be on his file because he was an ex-parliamentarian. If he ever sought office again, that could be taken into serious consideration. When Me Too came to the UK, it was Holyrood and Westminster that we saw the first wave of kind of allegations and accusations come out of, and I think it's because that's where power is rooted, and sexual harassment is about power. The House of Commons is a sort of late-night political fun palace. Ayesha Hazarika has worked in the political arena for more than 20 years. Since 2017, when we've been talking about Me Too, it's been very confessional. People have used this hashtag. Women have felt that they can give voice to their past experiences - some of it recent, some of it very, very historic. You appeared on a show in October 2017 with Alex Salmond. A lot of this is abuse of power. It often happens because it tends to be men in the top jobs. Well, I think sexism is rife in the House of Commons, but then it's rife across society. He was the alpha in the room, and that's quite tough when you're in a room with Julia Hartley-Brewer. The number of young women in the House of Commons throwing themselves at middle-aged male... PRESENTER: Oh, Julia! I'm sorry. Come on! We understand his appearance on television led some people to actually come forward because they were so incensed. I was pretty incensed after that programme, and I felt that both he and the other participant were doing this classic thing where they were sort of dismissing it all as, "Well, it's just the way things are. "Oh, the whole of society is sexist," as if that give some sort of excuse for parliament being sexist. I doubt very much if most of the cases that we're talking about is actually of a criminal nature at all. I agree with Julia. I think it's fatuous. I mean, 99% of what we're talking about are not police matters, but that doesn't make it right. While the spotlight was on Westminster, women working in Scottish politics began to come forward. A number of them went to prominent lawyer Aamer Anwar. I was friends with a number of individuals who worked in the Scottish Parliament who came to me and said that they had been sexually abused, that they had been sexually harassed and they wanted something to happen. He compiled a dossier based on the detail he collected. On the 29th of October 2017, his story made the front page of the Sunday Herald. What was the response that you had at Holyrood? One of shock. One of panic. I know there were individual politicians who were in touch and some who asked the question, "Am I in the dossier?" And I said, "If you're asking if you're on the dossier, "then you have a problem." One of the individuals who was accused was Mark McDonald, the minister. In November 2017, Mark McDonald resigned his cabinet post after complaints from female colleagues about his behaviour. He quit the party after he was found to have sent inappropriate text messages. Women were saying that they were having to come in contact with him, the horror of finding out that he's back at work, and yet they were sort of left high and dry on their own. There was no party that was immune from allegations of harassment, of abuse, and, of course, it started this sort of... It was almost like an explosion. What we are all discussing today is not a sex scandal, but an abuse of power, usually by senior men over women. This is the kind of behaviour women have felt that they just have to put up with, and this is a moment, I think, where we can say "No, we don't just have to put up with this." After the Me Too movement struck everybody, the Scottish Government decided that you need a new sexual harassment policy, and the Parliament did, as well. Fine. But then I discovered that they'd made it retrospective for ministers. Now, if you're going to make it retrospective, why don't you make it for all past MSPs? The new rules meant it was possible for people to complain about alleged past misconduct. Within a month of the rules changing, two civil servants had come forward with claims against Alex Salmond. Those first allegations became public as a dramatic tabloid scoop when journalists at the Daily Record uncovered details of a government investigation. Well, the story was that two women had complained about assaults of a sexual nature by the former First Minister, Alex Salmond. You know, you get a document like that and you're the editor of a national newspaper, then obviously the hairs stick up on the back of your neck. The story was written. All we needed to do now was get the quotes from Alex. The question was could we keep it to ourselves? I got a call from the political editor. His phone was going crazy with colleagues from other papers asking us what on Earth was going on. Before the Daily Record could publish its story, Alex Salmond sent a press release to every political journalist in Scotland. The first I saw was an e-mail that had come out from Alex Salmond to news outlets a little bit before the Daily Record story, saying that he was launching legal action against the Scottish Government, and that was Alex Salmond getting his defence in first. He's given it to everyone, so every journalist in the country was now working on this story. At that point, I ran out of that room and raced across the newsroom, shouting, "Publish that now!" It was natural for Salmond to come out with vehement denials, and for him to come out fighting. I'm... I'm no saint. I've got flaws. I understand that. But I have not sexually harassed anyone and I'm certainly not guilty of criminality. Now, when Alex said, "I am no saint, "but I have not engaged in criminality," I thought, "Well, something's happened somewhere." But something happening is not the same as a criminal offence. I think, in that moment, Alex Salmond had a choice to make, and what he did in the days after was going to set the tone. Salmond claimed that the investigation had been mishandled. You don't see the evidence against you. You don't see the witness statements. This cannot be a fair and just way to resolve these things. He announced he was suing the government he had once led. What I've decided to do is take the case to the Court of Session - the highest court in the land - so as that we can get a fair resolution of this. The SNP have been the party that doesn't wash its dirty linen in public, but this case has blown that apart. I think talk of a civil war was overhyped, perhaps, at that time, but we did see a split between those that would naturally side with Alex Salmond and those who took the First Minister's kind of approach. Many have asked how they can help directly, therefore I've established a crowdfunder to assist with costs. I think when he set up the crowdfunder, Nicola Sturgeon obviously couldn't comment, but what she did do was she shared a crowdfunder that was going around for Scottish Women's Aid... ..and I think that sent out a quiet but powerful message. CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICK, SHOUTING Within months of the Daily Record story, those first two complaints about Alex Salmond would become 14 criminal charges from ten women. Step away from the car, please. Thank you. Three of the women complainers, all of whose charges related to sexual assault, have agreed to talk to me anonymously. How and when did you decide to make the complaint? Around the time that everything was in the media. With everything coming to the fore with the Harvey Weinstein case, I couldn't stop thinking about it. And everyone was very, very concerned about rocking the boat. I didn't want to be a story. I didn't want to deal with it. I didn't want to be in the media. I didn't want to be involved in some sort of acrimonious process. I just wanted to get on with my job and with my life. I think, as a woman, you put up with so much. You don't ever take stock and think, "Is what's just happened to me something that's criminal?" If someone had sat me down at the time and said, "If you really need to think about what's happened to you, "this isn't OK. "We need to do something about this." What was it like to work with Alex Salmond? You know, I had the extreme privilege of working with one of the generation's greatest political talents, but there's many dimensions to people's characters. I absolutely loved my job and I felt very fortunate to be in the position I was in, and I was delighted to be working for the First Minister. Today, two more complainers took the stand. Woman C is an SNP politician. We were in the back of the car and folk were just chatting away, and at some point in the journey, Mr Salmond put his hand on my leg just above my knee. In what way? It wasn't a kind of quick touch where maybe you're chatting and the hand goes out and comes back. It stayed there really for pretty much the duration of the journey. Did you invite him to do this? Absolutely not, no. She said that she hadn't been able to tell her husband, who was in the car with her, because he adored Alex Salmond. He'd raised the party to unimaginable heights. Who was she going to tell? Who was going to believe her? Alex Salmond claims that an armrest in the back of the car would have made it impossible for him to touch Woman C without being seen. His driver described the mood in the car as jovial, saying he saw nothing happen, and believed that he would have if it had. Woman A is a senior official in the Scottish Government. She alleges she was assaulted on multiple occasions. She told the prosecution... He would put pressure on my shoulders and kiss me on the lips. It was very sloppy and unpleasant. He put his hands onto the side of my chest, then down over my hips, commenting, "You look good. "You've lost weight." The defence put it to her that the alleged events did not amount to criminality. His hand was on your back and ended up lower than you would have liked? Yes. Not grabbing or fondling you? On the side of my breasts. She was later asked... You call that groping? Yes. She was also pressed about her contact with the other women. You were very much a part of encouraging people to make a complaint and make those things that were trivial, nothing, turned into criminal charges. I was not encouraging people to make a complaint. Some people asked me for advice, but in every case, I said it was their decision to make. What Me Too did was to encourage women to come forward and tell each other their stories. Now, for the prosecution, that's perfectly straightforward, but it appeared that the defence was trying to paint a picture of some kind of conspiracy. For some, the timing of the allegations were less about Me Too and more about a growing schism between Salmond, Sturgeon and their allies. I declare that Nicola Sturgeon is selected as First Minister. APPLAUSE Within the SNP, there has always been a split between the more fundamentalists, the hard-core, the people who want independence now or sooner. There are Salmond camps and Sturgeon camps. I want independence and I want it now! Patience. We'll leave England soon enough. England?! I want independence from you! It is a very different style of leadership. Perhaps less flamboyant, more considered, more thoughtful, and in some areas, she has pursued very different policies. Are you going to have to say to him, "Please be quiet on independence for a while. I'm now in charge"? I think the media are desperate to suggest that there are great splits between me and Alex Salmond. There aren't. Just as tensions between the two were rising, Alex Salmond's political career was dramatically derailed. I declare that Colin James Clark is duly elected to serve in the UK parliament. For him to lose the seat as an MP, I think he was devastated. He couldn't really fathom why he'd lost. Massive knock to his confidence and the sudden realisation that, you know, you need to think about the rest of your life. He can't cope with the fact that there is no stage any more, so he goes where somebody offers him a platform. That's why he now appears on the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Notice, by the way, he didn't even flinch, right? LAUGHTER I'm one of these peculiar politicians who don't think we're in show business. I thought Alex had made a mistake in going into what I regard as the entertainment business. Go! Probably not good for his reputation, but that is Salmond - he's a major risk-taker. Happy New Year and welcome to The Alex Salmond Show. When Alex Salmond launched his own show on Russia Today, Nicola Sturgeon was said to have been enraged. He started working on RT, which is, you know, a Russian government organisation in reality. In a sense, it compromised his position. Do you feel that you'll be free to criticise Russian policy? Well, I'm free to say exactly what I like and, of course, it's an interview show, Kirsty. As you know, in interviews, you let your guests express their opinions. But I don't see why Nicola Sturgeon should have been the least bit upset. He's out of the game. He's lost his seat. He's not a player. So, why bother? Hello, this is the Alex Salmond Trial, a special podcast from BBC Scotland. Woman G, she said Alex Salmond told her to come back to Bute House. She said he was pouring shots of limoncello and he put his arm around her and tried to kiss her. She says she felt intimidated and trapped. Gordon Jackson, for the defence, put it that these incidents were thought of as nothing at the time, and to that, Woman G said that it was serious enough at the time that they actually changed the rules so that women weren't allowed to work with Alex Salmond on their own. Woman G's astonishing claim that female staff should not be left alone with the former First Minister at night was backed up by a further three civil servants. Alex Salmond and another defence witness denied that such a rule had existed. No matter the verdict in this case, this is going to be a wake-up call for workplace relationships in general. Woman F, at Bute House, he told her to sit down on the bed. Woman F said she felt a rising panic, but there was just... She was in a working environment where you do whatever the First Minister asks of you. She says she then found herself lying on the bed with Alex Salmond on top of her. He put his hands under the skirt of my dress and ran them over my thighs and my bottom and over my breasts. He was kissing me haphazardly, like someone who'd been drinking quite heavily, and was murmuring something like, "You're irresistible." In cross-examination, Gordon Jackson put Alex Salmond's version of the incident to Woman F. What I'm saying happened is there was a bit of cuddling between the two of you and you ended up lying side-by-side on the bed. It was described to me as a sleepy cuddle. Witness F did tell her line manager about what happened to her at Bute House. After that, this civil servant was put in a room on her own with Alex Salmond and given an apology. The First Minister told me he was sorry, that it had been unacceptable and that he'd been drinking more than usual, not just that night, but in general due to stress. He said he respected me and wanted to keep working together and apologised. I accepted the apology and remained in post and didn't experience any other behaviour I considered inappropriate. He knew he'd done something wrong. The question is, what he did wrong... ..was it criminal? And that's what the jury's going to have to determine. The burden of proof in a trial like this lies squarely with the Crown. Because so much of what's in the High Court is kind of mystifying. Alex Prentice has to prove any alleged crime beyond reasonable doubt. In sexual offences cases, this is no different, but it can be harder. It seems to be that, where consent is an issue, that that is where juries are most reluctant to convict. It's very difficult to convince juries beyond reasonable doubt. It's only around 10% of reported rapes and attempted rapes that ever get to court in the first place, and for it to get to court, there must be at least some supporting evidence under the laws of corroboration in Scotland. In Scots law, we have corroboration. That's a requirement that every criminal charge has two pieces of evidence or more before it can be considered proven. That is a burden that sexual crimes face more than any other type of crime because they're most often committed when two people are alone together, so you have situations where it's one person's word against another. There is a form of corroboration in Scots law known as the Moorov doctrine, which may well form a part of the Crown's strategy in this trial. Moorov doctrine is where you have a number of complaints that can't individually be corroborated, but by the fact that the complaints are so similar in nature, they can corroborate each other. REPORTER: Are you feeling confident, Mr Salmond? Good morning. Alex Salmond took his civil suit against the Scottish Government to the highest court in Scotland. HE SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY In the end, the government was forced to concede that the investigation had been flawed. Your approach is to say that the entire process is contaminated. That's precisely our position, Lord. I shall dismiss the petition. The court will now adjourn. The judge declared that the Scottish Government procedures were tainted. The person who'd been appointed to lead the investigation into the complaints had had prior contact with the two women who had made these initial complaints. The process has already been admitted as unlawful, as unfair, and as tainted by bias. Alex Salmond had, in his eyes, been vindicated. The Scottish Government had made a terrible blunder. Alex had caught them out on the blunder, and I thought that was it all over and done with. Thank you all very much indeed. Thank you. But the case was far from over... ..and questions began to be asked about the involvement of Nicola Sturgeon. It seems to me that I am being simultaneously accused of being involved in a conspiracy against Alex Salmond and also of colluding with Alex Salmond. I sat down with Kenny MacAskill, one of Alex Salmond's most vocal allies. You claim very publicly it was an orchestrated campaign by senior people in the Scottish Government to bring Alex Salmond down, and that dark forces were at work. Well, I think the whole civil case unravelled. We saw that. It seems to have been predicated on, "How do we fit up a case against Alex Salmond?" There was collusion going on to try and both encourage the police and, indeed, to bring down Alex Salmond. The question of encouraging women to come forward if they think there has been wrongdoing, there's nothing conspiratorial about that, is there? Absolutely not, but, normally, what you do in an investigation is you have the case that's put before you. What you don't do is then go and interview almost anybody who seemed to have so much as, you know, passed in front of Alex Salmond. Why would the machinations of the Scottish Government actually want to bring Alex Salmond down? I can only operate on the speculation that's been given to me, and I can't hazard a guess on it beyond that, is that they were worried about the return of Alex Salmond and therefore they decided to put him out. Woman K said Alex Salmond had very forcefully grabbed her buttocks while they were having their photo taken, and Gordon Jackson was asking if this was an abuse of power rather than a sexual thing, and she said, "The First Minister grabbed my backside "because he could." After Woman K, we moved on to Woman J. She says Alex Salmond took her by the shoulders and kissed her on the cheeks, and he leaned in to kiss her on the mouth, and she said she was in complete shock and she said that she looked back on this like an awful nightmare. Alex Salmond denies these charges. In the case of Woman K, this was supported by a defence witness. At the beginning of week two, one of the sexual assault charges is withdrawn by the Crown. We don't have 14 charges any more. We have 13. Witness E has gone. All nine women had now taken the stand. I asked some of them about their court appearance. What was the experience like of being in court? It was terrifying. I mean, the first thing I did was look over to the jury and you're just sort of assessing them, thinking, "Are you going to be the jury that does the right thing here?" It's incredibly difficult to relive something that you felt was so mortifying. And even now, I struggle to talk about it without getting emotional. The whole ordeal is something I wish that I hadn't had to do, but I remain firm in my belief that it was the right thing to do. The prosecution case is now over, and tomorrow, the defence will begin in earnest. There he is leaving now, actually. I'm taking stock with other journalists on what we've heard so far. Alex Salmond? Yeah. What do you think about it, Dani? I'm staggered by the defence and how it's changed, how the tone's changed. It was all going to be about the orchestration of a campaign and about consent, and now it just seems to be, "Oh, well, he was inappropriate, but is it criminal?" That's a huge shift, isn't it, from start to finish, I think? The best-case scenario, so all the things he even agrees to, is that he was drinking, often heavily, late at night in Bute House with women who are half his age alone in the room with him, and either consensually or not, having some kind of sexual contact. Some of this is painting a picture that isn't that edifying about what was going on in Bute House. Look at Alex Salmond now in the dock - a really diminished figure. If you think back, though, he was such a towering presence... He walked on water. ..and he's very persuasive. So, it's nine o'clock, and now it's going to be quite an extraordinary day cos we're expecting Alex Salmond to face questioning from his own counsel. Gordon Jackson took him through the charges one by one. Now, the demeanour, first, between the two men was all hail-fellow-well-met, like banter between two older men. Gordon Jackson appeared to be this kind of bumbling kind of, "I can't quite remember this. What was this here?" You know? "Oh, yeah. Right. Was it that day?" And then Alex Salmond could say, "It was this date," so forth. During the course of the testimony, each of the individual charges was put to him in turn. Of Woman G, "'She says, on the way out, you touched her bottom.' "'No, it didn't happen,' said Alex Salmond." A gentle shove to chivvy her up the stairs. It was totally and utterly harmless. What about Woman F? Well, there was an incident involving Woman F at Bute House. He says his behaviour was inappropriate, but there was an apology. I was going to give her a kiss goodnight and we lapsed into what I would describe as a sleepy cuddle, lying side-by-side in a cuddle. I was First Minister, she was in my bedroom and we were tipsy. It shouldn't have happened. And though he admits that the encounter with Woman F did happen, he claims it was consensual, which she strongly denied in her testimony. "'The indictment says your intention was to rape her. "'What do you make of that?' says Gordon Jackson." It's not true. I've never attempted to have non-consensual sexual relations with anyone in my entire life. "'I don't think I even intended to cuddle her. "'I think that happened because of "'the tipsy circumstance.'" Another complainer, one with the most serious charge of attempted rape, "'That simply didn't happen.'" But on an earlier occasion, there had been consensual sexual relations. In August of 2013, it was initiated by Woman H and consensual. From the start, Alex Salmond's allies have suggested that many of the accusations are simply made up, and that some of the women are motivated by politics. He put that in his own words in the dock. I'm of the opinion that events are being reinterpreted and exaggerated out of any possible proportion. One reason - some are deliberate fabrications for a political purpose. Some are exaggerations taken out of proportion. When asked by the Crown about Woman A, who Alex Salmond alleges whipped everything up... His voice became very, very angry, and you could see that this had been something he'd been itching to say for a very long time. She's encouraged at least five other people to exaggerate or make claims against me. The other way of looking at that is, post the Me Too trigger... Women getting together to help each other come forward to tell their stories has got nothing wrong with it. What Alex Salmond appears to be suggesting is there was some kind of conspiracy, and the conspiracy is to do him down. Not guilty! Nice one, Alex! When Salmond's former chief of staff, Geoff Aberdein, took the stand, he added fuel to the political firestorm. He stated he'd met Nicola Sturgeon and one of the women on the 29th of March 2018... I call on Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister, please. ..four days earlier than she'd told Parliament she had first learned of the complaints from Alex Salmond himself... On the 2nd of April, he informed me about the complaints against him, which, of course, in line with the procedure, the permanent secretary had not done. ..leading to speculation that she knew about the inquiry earlier than she'd told Parliament. She says she has had no interference with the investigation. If it transpires that she hasn't been entirely transparent with the Parliament, I think things would be very difficult for her. You have to ask yourself this - if a friend of yours was in a similar pickle and they asked to see you, what would you do? You must think, "God, I mean, she knows... "She knows what she owes Alex." These are all the doubtful? These are all undecided voters. We have to remember Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon, you know, they're more than colleagues. He was her mentor, so she did the very, very difficult thing of ceasing contact with him, and I don't think we should underestimate how difficult that was for her. Let me hear you! CHEERING It would be a cruel irony if the only casualty of this whole sorry tale was... ..the First Minister, was a woman. The future of our country is on the line. But would anybody be surprised by that? Nicola Sturgeon has been conspicuously absent from these proceedings. The other woman in Salmond's life, his wife, Moira Salmond, attended court on day nine amidst rumours she might appear as a witness, but she was never called. The end of the trial is now in sight, but today I'm in London at Newsnight covering the Covid crisis. All of us, and it is vital to help us save lives. PHONE BEEPS You're saying the jury's just been sent out? And what sense are you getting? Are you getting any sense? I hear from my colleagues in Edinburgh that there have been two stonking closing speeches. They both open with exactly the same line. So, here's Alex Prentice for the Crown. "I wish for my life that the First Minister was a better man "and I wasn't here." You heard that from Woman H. Then we have Gordon Jackson's closing speech. "'I wish on my life the FM was a better man "'and I wasn't here.' "These were the words the advocate depute used "to open his speech. "'Good line,' I thought. 'Good line.' "He certainly could have been a better man, "but I'm concerned with whether he was guilty of serious - "sometimes very serious - criminal charges." Alex Prentice, prosecutor, says... The complainers in this case are courageous, brave women who spoke up to call out the abusive conduct of the former First Minister, that they were prepared to put up with a lot to keep the employment they so dearly loved. "They felt they had nobody to turn to for an effective remedy. "Well, they do now." I invite you to convict Alex Salmond of the charges against him. Then we go to the Gordon Jackson speech defending Alex Salmond. Is there something else we don't know in this political thing? I can't prove it, but I can smell it. There's something not right. He doesn't quite use the word conspiracy, but the pattern is, in his view, that these women had felt that, actually, at the time, there wasn't really that much to complain about, but in some way, they were brought together, all to complain together. This has gone far enough, gone on long enough. It's time I say to you quite bluntly to bring this thing to an end. And I can't get over that some of the hard-bitten male court reporters and political journalists think he's dead in the water, but I am not sure. 2.20 on a Friday afternoon. Are we going to get a verdict today or are we going to get a verdict on Monday? Nobody knows. PHONE RINGS Hello. No verdict? Monday! Oh! Oh, my God. I don't know if my heart can take this! Well, at least we'll be there. As the trial has progressed, the streets around us have become increasingly deserted. New jury trials in Scotland have now been halted, but this one continues. So, Alex Salmond making his way into court at the start of the third week. The jury have been thinking about this all weekend and it seems inconceivable to me that there isn't a verdict today. After deliberating into the afternoon, the clerk of court asks the foreman of the jury if they've reached a verdict. We have. Charge 10 and 11 - not guilty. Charge 14 - not guilty, so... There we go. ..he's not guilty, yeah. So, Alex Salmond has been acquitted on all 13 charges brought by nine women. 13 acquittals, one of which was not proven. So, that means the former First Minister, in a most sensational trial, has been found not guilty. With each not guilty verdict that came out, my heart sort of stopped with each one. And I don't know why, but I thought it would be different for mine. I know what happened. And then it wasn't - it was not guilty and, yeah, I was just in absolute shock. The Crown Office sent in the best prosecutor they have, and yet, 13 times, the jury said, "No, we don't believe you. "Salmond's not guilty." I was against a wall, and as each one came in, I just slid closer and closer and closer to the ground, and by the end of it, I was just crying on the floor. It was just like being punched in the stomach. Now, I've described some of his conduct with the civil servants as deplorable, and so it was deplorable. But the jury didn't find that to the level of criminality. CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICK, REPORTER SHOUTS Now, ladies and gentlemen, as many of you will know, there are certain evidence that I would have liked to have seen led in this trial, but for a variety of reasons, we were not able to do so. At some point, that information, that facts and that evidence will see the light of day, but it won't be this day, and it won't be this day for a very good reason, and that is whatever nightmare I've been in over these last two years, it is as of nothing compared to the nightmare that every single one of us is currently living through. Go home, those who can, are able to, take care of your families, and God help us all. Thank you very much. Alex Salmond! Alex Salmond! Kirsty Wark, BBC! REPORTERS SHOUT Elbow touch with the QC who defended Alex Salmond. Thank you. Mr Salmond, did Nicola Sturgeon conspire against you? I'm not sure if you can talk to us, Gordon Jackson, can you? Was it a hard trial for you? Yes. Why was it particularly hard? Just publicity, the demands. It just was, but... A different kind of trial? Absolutely, but serious. Listen, I'm away before I end up talking to you people. Alex Salmond did not respond to requests to appear on this programme. He has made no further formal statement since the final day of the trial. Some of his former colleagues continue to claim that there was a political plot behind the case. When I interviewed Nicola Sturgeon for Newsnight, I asked her what she made of it. People are becoming vocal, alleging conspiracy around people close to you to bring him down, so what do you say to that? There was no conspiracy. It's a heap of nonsense. Look, there's going to be inquiries, parliamentary inquiries, where I'll have the opportunity to have my say and be asked questions and scrutinised, and, you know, I'll deal with that in the fullness of time. In his statement outside court at the end, Alex Salmond referred to certain evidence he would like to have seen led. So, what evidence have you seen of any, you know, dark forces, of orchestrated campaigns? Well, I've had discussions with several people, more than several people, and indeed from different sectors - within law enforcement, within Alex Salmond's camp, and indeed elsewhere. So, this is tittle-tattle, and I can't claim to have the hands on it, but there are individuals who gave evidence who I know, because I've been a member of the SNP, and they were longstanding like me, I believe their evidence to have been entirely false. It's sort of insulting to say that you think that a couple of women could persuade eight other women to lie to the police and then perjure themselves in the High Court. For what? I didn't even know who all of the complainers were. He discredited himself very well on his own doing. It didn't require ten women to lie about him. To be called a liar, to read online that you're part of a cabal, to say that you're part of a coven of harpies is just... ..shattering, but I know that I was telling the truth. I know what happened to me. Thank you very much indeed. Thank you. I have never, in all my years as a journalist, witnessed anything like this. The caravan's moved on, but the repercussions are still massive, I mean, not only for Alex Salmond, but for the Me Too movement and for women that want to bring a grievance, but also, not just for politics in Scotland, but for the very government of Scotland. In a way, this story is only just beginning. Alex Salmond's place in British political history was never in doubt... And the dream shall never die. ..but what comes next for a man who was once described as a "political Lazarus"? You've not seen the last of my bonnets and me. CHEERING Alex Salmond's character and personality was turned outside in for all the flaws to be seen, and I think once people see what was done in relation to Alex Salmond that did not need to be done, the volcano will go off underneath the SNP. What you're saying is a man can try to kiss a woman or he can say completely inappropriate things to her when he's 30 years older than her and is the First Minister of Scotland. I'm worried about what this says more widely to other women or just to us as a society. I mean, where does this leave us?
