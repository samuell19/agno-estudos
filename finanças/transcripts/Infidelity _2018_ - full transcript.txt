An Adulterer How old are you? 25. And moving wouldn't scare you? Not at all. I'm mobile, I've got no ties. It wouldn't be a problem. OK, that all looks good. We'll be in touch. Did a lot of people apply? Quite a few. Do you think... That's all I can say. Thanks. Stay with me. Kader's waiting. Come along. I don't want to. They won't answer faster if you stay here. I've got no chance. I bet 40 people applied. Why me? Don't be so pessimistic. You're good. Anyway, Paris is nicer than Angoulême. Yes... Promise you won't take this badly. What? It's Kader. I really like him, but... It's almost like he lives here. - He sleeps in my room. - But he's got his own key. You had Gaëtan around. That was six weeks. He slept here three times. What do you want me to do? Nothing. I'm going to... What? I'm looking for a place. It'll be best for me, for you and for Kader. Listen... I have to go. - Let's talk tomorrow. - OK. I contacted an agency. Alice Fontaine? Yes. - Hello, I'm Julien Lemonnier. - Hello. It's upstairs. Excuse me. I didn't realize. It's dark, isn't it. It's a bit gloomy today. Normally, it's much brighter. Is it just you? Yes. I'm in a flat-share, but it's getting a bit cramped. What you lose in space you'll gain in independence. The bathroom's down that way, if you'd like to... A wardrobe. The good thing is that it's a bit under your budget. Sorry, but... No? No, it's too oppressive. And I like open-plan kitchens. They feel bigger. I've got one. It's a bit more expensive. Much more? - No. - When can I see it? Now, if you like. It's in the area. I'd just need to get the key. OK. I've never rented an apartment on my own. It's hard to envisage. I'm a bit confused. What do you do? Graphic design. In a permanent job? I'm freelance. - Does that rule me out? - No. We look at your whole profile. Go ahead. It'll look different with furniture. How much is it? 120 euros more. It's fully furnished. You'd have no expenses. Just bring your things. It's a bit pricy. Do you have a guarantor? Yes, my mum and step-dad. They were my guarantors at the old place. They're in Bordeaux. - Are you from there? - No, Paris. My mum moved when my dad died. I may have to move to Angoulême. So are you looking there too? I had a job interview. They haven't answered. I'm sure I won't get the job. Sorry, clients like me can't be easy. No problem. You need patience in my line of work. OK, let's go. Go ahead. I'll call. I've got a better idea now. - I'm hard work. - No. - Bye. - Bye. Keep me posted on the job. I won't get it. Is your mind made up? If I find a place, yes. Think a bit more. I've done my thinking. What if Kader comes less? No. OK, girls. Carbonara or tomato sauce? Tomato sauce. - Alice? - I'm OK, Kader. - I ate. - Just to try. I'm cooking, for once. I'm OK, Kader, really. Morgane, tell her, pasta's my speciality. OK, just to try. - Just. - Hence my question: tomato sauce or carbonara? Tomato sauce, like me. OK. And you're not just being polite? No, I'm not. OK. I'm going to miss you. I'm going to miss you too. Here it is. It's a bit cheaper, because it's on the ground floor. Here we go. But it's got a charm. Is the ground floor dangerous? No. It depends on the neighbourhood. I'd feel nervous. I'm not very brave. Did someone attack you? No. Or, yes, once. But it's not really relevant. Nothing serious? They guy was totally drunk. I ran away. But I was scared. If something happened in an apartment I'd found for you, I'd feel bad. - I hope so. OK, so... the ground floor isn't safe, the top floor is too expensive... Am I a pain? No. Sorry, it's not your fault. The situation is stressing me out. Don't worry, we'll find something. Are you sharing with a friend? Yes. And her boyfriend's too much? Yes. You must hear that a lot. Well, it's... Excuse me. Sorry. Yes? OK, so what do we do? OK. I don't really have much choice. OK, see you later. - Sorry. - Another tough client? - No, it's... - Personal? It's my wife. - I've made you late. - No. She's got my keys and she'll be an hour late. It's OK. I'll wait in a café. OK, bye. See you soon. Bye. And sorry again for... Stop apologizing. Could I have a drink with you? I don't want to go home. My flatmate's not alone. Of course. Of course. His name's Kader. He's nice, but he's a bit inconsiderate. He came in once while I was having a shower and brushed his teeth, like we were siblings. A brother wouldn't do that with his sister. Did he try... No! He just didn't realize. What about you? Do you have a boyfriend? I used to. It was... A long time ago. He annoyed me, I annoyed him. I'm very difficult. That's true. What about you? Have you been married long? Yes. - And you have a son. - How did you know? I saw, on your desk. Oh, yes. That photo's a few years old. He's older now. How old is he? He's... Excuse me. Sorry. Hello, yes? Ah, good. OK. OK, I'm on my way. It's all sorted. - It's OK. - Why should you? I'd like to. Really. OK... Thanks. Are you staying? Yes. Thanks again. See you soon. - Bye. - I'll call soon. - Hi, Alice. - Hi. - OK? - Yes. Thanks for the coffee. See you soon, Julien. No! You fool! Sorry, my fingers move too fast sometimes. What a fool! If you move out, Kader will move in. You see? I'm not pressuring you. - Any progress? - What? Yes. Actually, no. You can stay if you don't find a place. - Hello, Mum? - Hello, darling. - Did you leave a message? - Yes. I need a guarantor again. Why are you moving out? I've just woken up, Mum. I'll call back and explain. Are you anxious? No. Yes, hello? - Alice Fontaine? - That's me. Hello. - I didn't recognize your voice. - I'm running. - Is it a bad time? - No. I go out running, sometimes. OK, I've got something to show you. What is it? A loft studio. I like it a lot. OK, I'm free. Good. Shall I send the address? OK. It's nice. We can't shift it. I love it. How much is it? 1,900. I can't! I can't get rich overnight. I know, but I wanted to show it to you. That's kind. One day, maybe. Maybe. You must have thought that SMS I sent was daft. Yes, very. It just slipped out. When I feel something, I can't hide it. Then don't. Are you here? Yes, on a visit. David Loussine, a colleague. Hello. Hello. Sorry, I didn't understand. No, we've finished. Go ahead, please. - Hello. - Enjoy it. Thanks. Go ahead. I've got a 35m2 place in Charonne, at 950. Can you do Wednesday, at 3pm? Yes. I'll text you the address. With a kind word? I have appointments. - Bye. - Bye. I can't. I'm sorry. I know I said yes, but I can't. Sick? No, I'm not sick. My boss needs me. And I'm behind, so if I say no... Don't be daft! Did I say he'd fire me? Just listen. He may be my boss, but he's always right with me. He's asked me for a favour. I can't say no. You don't know what to do? Call Mounir! He's not busy. OK. Bye. That guy's hard work! Sorry, Alice. Julien Lemonnier: 17 Rue d'Avron. Wed 3pm. Please confirm. Hello. We've met before. Mr Lemonnier was busy. I'm replacing him. - Shall we? - Yes. Thanks. You can see, it's nice and bright. It's in perfect condition. You can smell the paint. This is the best match for what you want. Yes. We've had some other interest, so... I'll try to think fast. Good. See you soon. - Bye. - Bye. Come over. Come over. I sent my colleague. I noticed. Listen, I think it'd be best if we... how can I... not to get involved in something we may... regret. You deserve better and from my point of view, I don't want to... - I understand. I... I wanted to tell you. Thanks. Good luck. Shall I drop you off? No, it's OK. Bye then. What's up? Good news: I had a row with Kader! You can stay, now. We split up! Come on, it was just a row. No, he's an idiot! I never want to see him again. - What happened? - Nothing! Something happened. He's screwing a whore! A whore? A whore, a slut, a slag, whatever you like. I never want to see him again! I want you to stay! It's too late. I've found a place. Or almost. - You haven't signed. - No. But it's as good as. No. It'll be OK. I'm sure it'll be OK. Mr Lacas is running late, but he wants to see you. Do you mind waiting? - No. - Coffee? - Yes, please. - I'll bring it to you. Hello. - Hello? - It's me, Julien. - Yes? - I... I want to see you. - But... - The other day, I was a bit... I really want to see you. When? Are you free today? - Yes. - Do you want to? Yes. And your colleague's not coming? I took both keys. I'm hungry. Me too. I want a big plate of pasta, with parmesan. There's nothing here, but there must be a local pizzeria. Have you brought anyone else here? To visit? No, not to visit. No. You've never done this? No. But do you believe me? Yes, I believe you. I've got no regrets, but... Sh. Be quiet. Don't talk about that. How was the appointment? Good. Or, not really. The guy was too busy to see me. But as I understood it, he likes what I do. And did you have any news from Kader? Yes. Did it work out? He wants it to, but I don't. Did he apologize? Does he regret it? He does, but I don't care. Idiot! You were right. I never said that. Who's that? My mother. What? That's not a "mum" face. It wasn't my mother. Have you met someone? Yes. See? Life's good. Almost. Did you think about me? No. - Not at all? - Not at all. And you? I did. I slept like a log. So you're not romantic. No. What do you like about me? - Guess. - No, tell me. Your cock. Huh? Ah! That's clear, at least. Do you know what I like? No. Don't you like them? I love them. But not the best. It's your smile. But I like the rest, too. Me too. Does your wife work? Yes. What does she do? She runs a tea room. On Rue Bichat. Is she the boss? Yes. It's a small place. She has two part-timers and under 10 tables. Do you ever go? Rarely. Will you send me a bedtime message? Maybe. Can I send you one? Of course. - Do you delete them, afterwards? - Do you? No. Same here. What are you looking for? A romantic spot that's quiet and secluded. To do what? Stuff. So? Well... Nothing. We'll just have to text. Are you kidding? No, I swear. He's married, with a kid? Yes. What are you expecting? - Nothing. - Then what are you doing? - Hey? - It wasn't my choice. It was! No one forced you! You're gorgeous! You could have anyone and you go for a guy that's got someone. I'm his first. - Right! - I swear. You disappoint me, you really do. - I shouldn't have told you. - No, you shouldn't. Goodnight. Sign here and here. Did you copy your ID? Yes. Bertrand? You've got it. I gave it to you this morning. - In your bag. - Ah, yes. I'm going mad! Thanks, it was very good. - Here. - Thanks. - Are you happy? - Yes. - When is it? - In a month. - It's it better? - It's smaller, but better. - Where is it? - Rue d'Avron. How long are you staying? Just two days. We're going to see a show. - It's a musical. - What is it? Crime and Punishment. - Do you want to come? - I can't. And how's work going? Good. A publisher is doing a new kids series. - He loves my work. - Does it pay? Not much, but it'll help me get known. You're looking very well. Your cheeks have got some colour. You look beautiful. Yes. How about love? No, nothing to report. Remember Lucas? He's the son of our friends that run the bookshop. The blond guy with lots of hair. We introduced you, in the hope... You didn't like him. Too bad for you. You know, he got married last month. It was lovely. I'm happy. It was huge. They had fireworks. Could I see the dessert menu? Are you having dessert? Yes. Who's that? The estate agent. It's about the paperwork. I need to make an appointment. I'm having profiteroles. Me too. What did you say, about tonight? I was in Nice. What would you be doing in Nice? David and I set up an agency there. It's not doing that well. Do you go often? No, usually he goes. Does David know? Is he OK with it? I wouldn't think so. Does he know your wife? Yes. While I've got you here... - Don't move. - What? What's that for? - To put online. - You bastard! Give it to me! No! This is Julien Lemonnier's answerphone. Leave a message after the tone. After recording, hang up or press the hash sign to modify. It's me. Either I've got this wrong or you forgot. Let me know. Call back. Bye. Hello. - A green tea, please. - OK. Urgent Server Required - Excuse me. - Yes? - Do you need a server? - Yes, as a replacement. - To replace you? - Yes. I'll get the boss. No, I... - Hello. - Hello. Are you interested in the job? I don't know. Maybe. Do you have experience? Yes, I worked in my uncle's pizzeria. What do you do know? I'm a student. I'm studying law. At which university? Assas. Do you have time? I can arrange it. I'll try not to put you off too fast. It's two months, three times a week. You won't be rushed off your feet, but the pay is minimum wage. And you don't get many tips. The locals think tips are patronizing. Really? Do you need any particular skills? It's not as hard work as pizzas. I'm Marie Lemonnier. You are? - Me? - Yes. I don't know if I want the job. - But what's your name? - Alice. Or Lily. Everyone calls me Lily. - How old are you, Lily? - 25. Have a think about it. Here's our number. You can always try it out, no commitments. The tea's on me. Thanks. How's it going in Nice? We're selling up. Maybe that's best. - Your sleeve. - Hey? You've stained it. It's OK, it's just water. - The wine tastes funny. - Really? Not to me. Yesterday's was nicer. - It's the same. - Can I try it? No. When's your next visit? I don't know. Why? I'd like to come. To Nice? Just for a change of scenery. I don't know. The sea's a bit cold. Pass the salad. It's with lemon. Not vinegar? I fancied lemon juice. Pass the lemon, then. I may have found a replacement. Really? A law student. I couldn't work out what she wants. Did you say that it pays peanuts? Some people need to work. Will you get the cheese, please? Why me? Because I'm asking. And bring some bread, please. You seem irritable. No. I don't know. - What's up? - Nothing. Maybe it's just Nice. It's no big deal. It's David. You forgot the bread. Sunday is his birthday. Oh no! I'll deal with it. Thanks. That's bad for your testicles. What? Holding your laptop like that. It damages your sperm. If you say so. It's not me. Do you want more kids? Maybe. What if we went away? Where? I don't know. Somewhere far. I need a holiday and so do you. It's not the right time for me. It never is. I'm exhausted. Aren't you? Yes. You can put those on the tables. - Is that all we've got? - No. - Hello. - Hello. There's an apron for you that way. OK. There are the teas: Assam, breakfast, Earl Grey, green, mint, lapsang souchong. Then we've got pear tart, lemon cake, chocolate cake. Then there's water, soda and fruit juice. No alcohol? No, no drunkards here. I'll show you the till. - Yes. - It's easy. Enter the table. I'll give you the numbers. Drinks. There we go. Then food. Then hit print. There you go. It's easier than the penal code. Yes. There are two customers. You take them on your own. OK. I'm here if you need me. Hello. I'll have a tea. Black or green? He seems very good. He works in psychology. But is he a doctor? Yes, he's a healer. He ran a hospital rheumatology department. He has the symptoms and the patient profile. That makes all the difference. The treatment suits the patient. Don't you buy it? So long as you're better. You're sceptical. Hello? It's me. Where are you? Taking my mum to the doctor's. Ah, hello, Michelle. Hello, Julien. It's about Mathias's present. I'll drop Mum at the doctor's and then I'll buy his present. What is it? A tablet. Hasn't he got one? Yes, but this will be his own. I think it's a bit too much. Then you get something. 50 euros will do for a birthday present. He's not graduating. That's a bit mean. I don't like giving money. OK, you choose. Otherwise OK? Yes, the new girl seems good. What new girl? I said, I took on a student. We did a trial earlier. She's starting next week. Oh, good. OK, my appointment's here. - Bye, Michelle. - Bye. - Bye darling. - See you later. Summer, in Corsica. Why in Corsica? She's Corsican. Oh, sorry. Her family's there. It'll be on a beach in Porto-Vecchio. - What if it's not nice? - It always is. It's in July. What's she like? Gorgeous. Here. Ah, yes! Is she an air hostess? On long-haul flights. Will she carry on? I don't see why not. Did you meet on a flight? No, she was a client. Your job is a good way of meeting people. We're there to do business. - There's more rice. - I'll do it. Just a bit. That's fine. Thanks. I went to Porto-Vecchio ages ago. Do you like civil or criminal law? Civil. Ah, divorces. Divorces generate a lot of work. I did three years of medicine, but dropped out for my husband. Didn't he want you to study? No, it was me. I was mad about him. I kept missing class. I couldn't study and be in love at the same time. It was beyond me. Do you have any regrets? Even if I hadn't fallen in love I don't know if I'd have finished. Does it scare you? Falling in love? It's happened. Doesn't it affect your work? No. Is he a student? No, he's working, but... I won't pry. No. Yes. I mean... Was he in jail? No, he's honest. In the legal sense, at least. That's something. He's married. Ouch. He's married, with a child. It's OK, for now. I'm working with it. And after? I don't know. What's his job? He's an IT engineer. Where are the candles? Second from bottom. That smells good. Where's my present? Wait a bit. What do we do? The present, then the cake? Let's wait for your father. What's he doing? I don't know. He doesn't care about this. That's right, he doesn't love you. And nor do I. Mum, I'm not five anymore! Unfortunately. We need more candles. Are you sure? Yes, look, that's 12. We need more. - Look again. - I took them all. Ah, here he is! I almost called. We'd given up. That smells good. Is your hair wet? Yes, I was at the pool. That's new. I used to go a lot. I fancied it. - Would you like to have come? - No. No. You needed to go, like having a piss? You watch your language. OK, let's move on to more serious matters. We need four more candles. Your present is the main thing. Why didn't you mention going to the pool? I don't know? Should I have? Which pool was it? Les Halles. Was it busy? Not too busy. He liked his present. Yes. What are you doing? Nothing. OK. What's up? I don't know. What's going on? - Are you angry? - No. - Is it because I'm tired. - No. - Did you want to make love? - It's not that. OK? I love you. I love you so much. Do you want some bread? No thanks. - What time are you starting work? - 2.30pm. Will I get a cup of tea, if I stop by? Of course. Then I'll stop by. I must look awful. No. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Goodbye. There's no apricot. - Strawberry or lemon. - OK. Sorry. Enjoy it. What a success! I don't know what happened. Word got around. - It's full. - Yes. Excuse me. I'll be right there. I'll get going then. It's the first time I've wished it wasn't busy. Me too. I love you. - Have a nice day. - Yes. Excuse me. I'll be right there. What are you doing? Sleeping? - We're busy. - I'm going. - That's twice the take on Saturdays. - Good. I'm off. Sorry about earlier. I was... No, it was my fault. - Are you taking the metro? - Yes. Shall I give you a lift? I bought it three years after our wedding. It was a print works. I fell in love with the place and I love tea, so... It was booming, to start. Now, except the odd good day, like today, which I can never understand... Why don't you sell up? It's not about the money. If I was losing money, I'd have to, but I'm not. How are your studies? Everything's fine. I'm revising with a friend tonight. And how's your "fiancé", so to speak. I'm still seeing him. He's with his family tonight. Is it still secret? You could say that. No one recognizes you in Paris. He takes me everywhere. Ah, sorry. - Hello? - Hello, it's me. I'm taking you for dinner. To a restaurant? Where? I booked at Diep. - With Mathias? - No. - He's with Antonin. - A romantic dinner. Yes. I'll treat you. We had a good day at work. Ah. I'm almost home. See you soon, darling. Bye. He hasn't called me darling for ages. - There are more than before. - No. I just moved them around. The balance is better. There are too many. - Do you want some? - I didn't mean that. The cleaner says the same thing. The less she does... How's it going with the new girl? Not bad at all. I almost don't want the old one back. She needs another baby. She was so sad, flat and dreary. And she didn't have the looks. When you go somewhere new, you want to see a friendly face. She never smiled. The new girl's prettier, but she lied to me. About what? She said she worked in a pizzeria, but it's not true. But she learns fast. What? I didn't say a word. Is the temperature wrong? Is it the water's mineral content? It's perfect. I found some photos of you as a child, with your father. I set them aside. I'll get them. You already gave me some. I know, but these are different. Where did I put them? We were on holiday. You were five or six, in the pool, in Biarritz. You had a ring with a duck's head. You already gave me those ones. Here they are. Have a look. I need my glasses. - Who is it? - Julien. What is it? He's going to Nice. And? Nothing. There you go. Thanks. Are you OK? Yes, why? You're not so cheerful. I don't come often, but... - Sorry, I... - It's OK. I've got a forgettable face. I like this place. It's like you. Do you live locally? No, I work nearby. Ah, in the building opposite. Your colleague has a beard. They remember him, not me. I'm Simon. I'm Marie. I know. - See you soon. - Bye. It's you. I didn't hear you. I should've been back earlier, but... - I haven't eaten. - Check the fridge. Will you sit with me? No, I'm exhausted. - Is Mathias here? - He's with Antonin. OK. Was everything good in Nice? No, we're stopping. Then you can stop going. He thinks the treatment's pointless. He recommended a diet. I said to him: "If I can't eat, what will I have left?" He said: "You'll find out. "You can act like this or you can make an effort." As a doctor, he's anti-medicine, so of course... He really wants me on a diet. I don't want to do it. Hello? - Mrs Lemonnier? - Speaking. It's A&E at Garches hospital. Your husband had a road accident. You should come as soon as you can. Is it serious? They're operating. That's all I can say. I'll be right there. I have to go. I don't know when I'll be back. OK. Thanks. Excuse me. Someone was brought here after an accident. I got a call half an hour ago. Julien Lemonnier. First floor, to the left. First floor. Thanks. Any news? - They're operating. - How is he? They didn't want to say. The operation's over. The surgeon's happy, but it's too early to comment. - To comment? - On the prognosis. Can we see him? I'm afraid you can't. Do we go or do we stay and wait? The doctor will be out in a moment. These are your husband's things. You go, I'll stay. I'll call you. Go on. Mrs Lemonnier? Yes. Your husband's operation went well. As well as possible. He's in the recovery room. Is there any lasting damage? It's hard to say. He's in a coma. It may last hours or days. You should go home. If there's any change, we'll call. OK? Where were you? Your father had an accident. Is it serious? How long could he be like that? They don't know. I'll just be a second. Hello? - Alice? - Yes. Open at 10am. I'll be along later. You didn't call yesterday. I couldn't. - I hope it's not serious. - Bye. See you later. We just need to carry on as normal. Yes. See you later. "My angel, "I'm sorry to have been so quiet. "I had a long talk with Marie last night. "She found everything out. "I'm not scared of conflict with her, "I'm scared of losing her. "I love you because you're gentle and beautiful. "I love her because she's a part of me. "I know I'm hurting you, "but if we carry on, I'll hurt you more, "and I don't want that. "Please try to understand. "I feel close to you and wish you true happiness. "PS: "Don't worry, I didn't tell Marie about you. "She asked lots of questions, but I didn't answer. "She doesn't know your name or your face "and she never will." - Hello. - Hello. - Not too busy? - No. Alice. I need to close temporarily. Why? My husband and I are going away, to Patagonia. It's a three-week dream trip. So I'm closing. How come? Well... How to put it? We've been through a difficult patch, but it's going better. So I won't need you anymore. I'll pay you what I owe you, for the whole contract. - No. - I want to. When are you closing? Today. We're flying tomorrow evening. OK. I'll give you a cheque. Then you can go home. Will you reopen when you get back? I don't think so. I'm going to sell. What will you do afterwards? I'll be with my husband. Are you in pain? No. Do you know where you are? In hospital. Do you know why you're here? A car accident. What's your name? Julien Lemonnier. Follow my finger. Good. Your wife's on her way. Is it serious? The operation went well. How long will I be here? It depends on your recovery. We'll see how it goes. They said you can come home soon. Mathias is coming. Is he well? Yes, he is. And I spoke to David. He's happy. - Will he come too? - Yes, if you want him to. I do. I was scared, you know. - OK? - Yes. - Stop? - Yes. That's a good start. Our miracle survivor looks in good shape to me. He looks rested. It's like he's been on holiday. Shall I bring you some food? You can't bring food in. - He's not on a diet. - This is good. You can't all be here at once. I need some space. OK, I'll go. Me too. Bye. Bye, son. See you soon, Julien. Thanks, Michelle. I'll make you some sauerkraut. - Bye, doctor. - Bye. I answered all your calls. There were a few. Who from? You know. But that's the past. Let's forget it. OK? Get some rest, darling. Put your arms up straight. Now spread them out. I'll push back. Here we go. That's good. Now back up. Go ahead. Excuse me, sorry. Hello, yes? - Hello? - Hello. - Hello, yes? - Yes? - Julien Lemonnier? - Yes. I'm from MACIF medical insurance. I'm just calling about the accident that you had. Sorry, I'm still in hospital. OK, I'll call back. - Thanks. - No problem. The doctor said to rest your leg. - I need to get out for a while. - Where? I don't know. To work. You can't see clients on crutches. David can cover for you, in the meantime. - Are you hungry? - No, I'm not hungry. All I do now is eat. I'll get Chinese. Marie. Do you want to ask something? Go ahead, I'm listening. Did you talk to each other? We had to. What did you say? I told her... playtime's over. It's time to go home. She understood. Don't worry about her. You don't mind, I hope. - Well? - No. It's as much my fault as yours. Maybe more so. I'm not mad at her. I can see why she fell in love with you. I couldn't resist. Sorry, I'm interrupting! I'm glad I wasn't 10 minutes later! We're your parents! I'll dump my bag and go back out. - Are you eating here? - Yes. You've got a bedroom! I'm going, too. Where? To make up. Aren't you reading? Is that good? Not bad. No, don't overdo it. You're still sick. I feel much better. No. - What's up? - I don't know. - Don't you want to? - I don't know. Sh. Stop it! I don't feel good. Are you sure you're up to it? I'm sure you're managing without me, but I need to work. I've got an appointment at the 180m2 place on Avenue Mozart. Wish me luck. David. Yes? Did Marie ask about... Yes. What did you say? The little I knew. I... I can't do fake surprise. Sorry. No, that's OK. No problem. See you later. See you later. Alice Fontaine Tel: 06 23 09 10 96 A small change in the statistics can turn a paradise into hell. The joy of the sun, sand and sea suddenly turns into fear. I'm going to bed. - I can switch over. - I've had enough. I'm going to bed anyway. By the way, when are you going back to work? I'm stopping. Why? I just don't feel like it. Goodnight. - Didn't you get anything? - No. - I mean... - No, nothing. We sent it to everyone, earlier in the week. Here, now we know you've got it. The 22nd and the 23rd. Do we stay the night? We've booked a hotel near Porto-Vecchio. Great. Will it be a big one? A hundred guests. Oh, right. How many did you invite? 20, 25. - It's not a fair fight. - No. It's not a fight. That's true. - Wine? - Yes. Thanks. - You've splashed it. - I'm sorry. Excuse me. - Marie... - No thanks. I'll get the dessert. I'm OK. - I'm tired. - Do you want to go? It's late. So no cake? It's on the top floor, so there's lots of light, As I said. There we go. It needs a lick of paint, but nothing much. - Do you like it? - Yes. - Is the view OK? - Who cares? - I'm sorry. - That's OK. No problem. The bedroom's this way. It's huge. It's 18m2. This is the bedroom. We're coming. - Hello, yes? - Hello. I'm from MACIF medical insurance. Sorry, I'm at work. I'll call back. Thanks. Excuse me. So? It's the best we've seen. - Madam? - Same. There's a primary school 100m away. I imagine... There's no chance. No. What? - No. I said no. - Come on. You're still angry. - It's not that. - It is. Lots of couples get on fine without making love. Love isn't just about non-stop sex. - You're punishing me. - No. You are. It's obvious. I just don't want to anymore. You don't want to... with me or not at all? Do you think I've met someone? I'm not like that. Maybe I just need time. Maybe it'll never come. I don't know. OK. - Watch the tree. - Don't worry. Yes! Aren't you scared? Of what? Driving again. - Are you scared? - No. What are you doing? Seeing if you're scared. OK. Check your mirror. There. Accelerate a bit. There we go. That's good. Is it difficult? No. Accelerate. Put it in fourth. - Not fourth. - Put it in fourth. Good. - Are you scared? - No. - What if I see a cop? - Run him over. That's good. - Ah, you're back. - It's not that late. OK? - Do you need help? - You can set the table. You should've come. He loves that drone. And the rest. What, apart from the drone? Nothing What's going on? He was pulling funny faces. Am I not included? He laughs at anything. How was my car? It's his age. It needs some work. It depends on your plan. I'm opening a Provençal bakery. That's a good idea. They need one here. Was business not good? It was full sometimes. Are you the owner or the agency? No, I'm the owner. - I'm the agency. - Have a think and give me a call. OK. - See you soon. - Bye. - See you soon, maybe. - Sure. Thanks for coming. I don't like him. You know, nowadays... Anyway, he won't call. Shall we go? Do you remember that time? It was a Sunday. We didn't realize people could see from the street. - It only happened once. - Twice. - Are you sure? - I'm certain. - Your memory's better than mine. - Yes. Can I get past? Stop it. Look at this. Its 10 to 25 July. The price is a joke. Antonin and Clotilde are going. There are trained lifeguards there. You can't say no. The 22nd is David's wedding. I'm not invited to David's wedding. That's true. - So can I go? - Yes. If everyone's happy... - No? - You're a pushover. I'm asking you. In the hope I'll agree. Obviously. Then you win. I agree. What's up with her? Are you angry? Is it something I said? If the sailing's a bad idea, I'll say no. It's not up to him. What's up? I can't do it anymore. You can't do what? I can't forget. I can't keep pretending. You're here, it's all fine, you've moved on, your son's going on holiday, we're going to a wedding, life's good! I can't do that. The better it is, the more it's here. It just gets worse. I said I'm sorry. I'm apologizing again, Marie. What can I do? Tell me. Yes, OK. Got it. Bye. You know the Rue d'Avron apartment? Yes. The owner's renting it out again. The tenant left 10 days ago. Did he say why? No. - Was there a problem? - No. She always paid the rent. She decided to move on. Where? No idea. I don't want to know. I hope you don't. - Have you seen her since your crash? - No. I need a coffee. Are you coming? No thanks. - See you later. - See you later. - What time's school? - Now. Then get going. Mum told me. About? Well... Before your accident. What do you think? I'd like to have your opinion. I don't have one. Don't tell her I said. What are you doing today? Something important. I'd like you to come too. What do you think? I don't know. I like the colour. - Long Beach Blue. - What? Long Beach Blue is the name. You can use it if you like. I'm not sure it's my style. Well, we can still have a look. Can we do that? That's why it's here. Get in. - So? - Actually, I like it. It's roomy, with six windows, so it's bright. South-west exposure, fitted kitchen, with waste disposal. - Stop. Gas heating and... - Stop! - Velux. - He'll get angry. - It's free next week. - Can I help? - I know. You're going to say you've had a lot of interest in it. - Sorry? - We'll take it. Seriously? I never joke. Initial and sign, right? Sorry. Hello, yes? Mr Mazolla, how are you? Yes. OK. Thanks. And he won't try to haggle? No. Are you sure? You were sure he wouldn't call back. Whatever, he's late. I'd take a quarter of the price. Yes, steady on. I hate this place. I thought you liked it. No. If you say so. He's arrived, he's just parking. She came here. Who came here? Alice. She went one better. She worked here. Without knowing, I took her on. She was the student I took on. She's soiled this place. Didn't she say? That's weird. You thought you knew her, but you didn't. To screw her wasn't to know her. How long was she here? Almost two months. That takes a certain mentality. She was spying on your wife. She screwed us both. I suppose you saw her as the soppy, fragile, romantic type. But actually... Hello. - Hello, Mr Mazolla. - It's the big day. What's wrong with him? He's in pain, but he wanted to come. - Hello. - Hello. Thanks. Have you got a holiday coming up? - No. - No. You should take one. You need to rest. - And for my pain? - No, just get some rest. I have a country house. The countryside's good. Meanwhile, take this. That'll do you good. Thanks. - How much is it? - 50 euros. Please. Île de Beauté. - That's Dad's wine. - Yes. You know... That's amazing. Go away! When's the party? - In two weeks. - Great. - Bye. - Thanks, I enjoyed it. - Me too. - See you soon. - I'll call tomorrow. - Good. Drive safely. A few months later, Marie and Julien decided to divorce. They used one lawyer, to speed things up. Dad, Mum, come in! The water's so nice. Julien found an apartment for Marie to move into. Come on! Mathias stayed with Julien. Come on! Tempted to see Alice, Julien pulled out all the stops to find her. He found out she was in Bordeaux with someone her own age and stopped trying to contact her. I'm waiting, Dad. It's really good. Subtitles: ECLAIR
