He was just the most fascinating person I've ever met in my life. He was Malachi Martin. There is one Malahi Martin. He drew you in. Very, very charming. He was a warrior for God and he still is a warior for God. He was a great mythomaniac. He was a liar and a scoundrel. And a cheat. Good evening. Tonight we have a vey special geust and it's my true honour and pleasure to have made his acquaintance. He is considered one of the most knowledgeable experts on the Vatican in the world. He is, first of all, a very eminent theologian. Expert on the Catholic Church, former Jesuit, and proffessor at the the Vatican's Pontifical Biblical Institute. He is author of national bestsellers Vatican: The Final Conclave, Hostage To The Devil and The Jesuits. He is also an exorcist. Exorcism, that is a healing. And it's a very horrid healing. But it does heal. Inside, it is a living hell. It's a living hell. The truth is, whether we like it or not, the Devil does exist. He is out there, he is our enemy, and he hates us. His aim is th destroy our souls. This is a reality that does exist. It's not everybody but there are real cases. That's why the rite of exorcism exists. If the Church didn't believe it, it wouldn't do it. It wouldn't even worry about it. I don't belieive that words teach. Words don't teach. Experience teaches. I think people have to have their own experiences. I also know that once someone encounters that evil presence, They know They know what exists and what doesn't. There is a lot of scurrilous information out there on the Internet about Malachi that basically maligns him, his character as well as himself, his person. And this is part of setting the record straight. In addition to being my friend, he was a good and holy man. I just want to set the record straight on that. We did not talk an awful lot about his exorcism except the last one. I kept asking him not to do it. And he kept saying, "I am only going to be an assistant." Not much chance of that. An exorcist has to be a very holy priest. Protected by graces of the Church. And I think, again, in that last exorcism that he was involved with, I still believe that Malachi was the target. Not that little girl. She was the bait. Is it the way we saw it in The Exorcist? That's a purely fictional account based on no fact. I've never seen the head turning back 180 degrees. Perhaps we could begin by you telling us a bit about yourself, your background, and some of the activities that you are currently engagedin. I think Iam going to bore you but sombody listening to this tape doesn't know about me so I suppose we should cover the essentials. I was born in Ireland, in Kerry, 70 years ago. 70 years ago. Don't forget the 70, seven-zero. I was educated in Ireland and I joined the Jesuits in Ireland, just before the war began, and then after the war, having done my philosophy, they sent me to Belgium for my studies, and then, when I was finished, they posted me to Rome to the Pontifical Biblical Institute. That's an institute in the Vatican which trains professors of scripture. It's fallen on evil days asregards doctrine. If you were an American Catholic in 1955, the world would have looked extraordinary to you. Huge nembers of converts were flowing into the Chuch. Church were being built at a huge rate. Then the Vatican Council took place, which was to renew and reinvigorate the Church, which was already growing hugely. And BANG, within couple of years, it all goes terribly wrong. Churches are being closed. Nuns and Priests flocking out of the church. The religious orders are winding down. Every social problem which the Catholic Church felt it had already solved came back to bite it. The Council was not a boy-scout jamboree. It was a collection of very human beings who were involved in a battle for the future of the Church. They were talking about making the Church more human. more up-to-date. More modern. More with it. More of sevices to the world instead of to dominate. That was a vey exciting time in the history of the Church. Malachi Martin was of immense in helping me discover some of those people who were out there making it happen. Making the revolution happen. -This was Vatican II? -Vatican II. 1962 to 1965, formented by the popes in question. And by the cardinals. The spirit amongst them was, at all cost, bt all means, let's get with the world. We've been isolated. Let's modernise everything And in order to do that, in the Vatican Council, they jettissoned sacred traditions that had always been traditions in the Catholic Church back to the time of the first popes. In the first century. He was from Ireland. He was um... came from quite a large brood of childen As far as I know, he had only one sister. I may be wrong. But he had a number of brothers, all of whom became rather well-read and religious, Catholic-religious in their own right. The Martine brothers. And Malachi was no slouch either. He was following, pretty much in his brothers' tradition. He was like a young, clerical Indiana Jones, crawling around caves in the Middle East. He was one of the original people who helped decipher the Dead Sea Scrolls. He spoke multiple languages. He was always an unswervingly loyal Cathilic. Loyal to the Papacy. Loyal to our Lady in Christ. That formed fis belief system down to his core. He definitely cut a very sexy figure. At parties, he would be the life of the party. Telling his dirty jokes. I became a good detective, as I was, in fact, a good correspondent for Time magazine. I got to the bottom of everything. He had all stories, some of which even turned out to be true! Kaiser was a stringer for Time magazine during Vatican Council II. Kaiser was very deeply involved with the Jesuits. The Jesuits had always been afraid that when Malachi left, he would just spill the beans about everybody. Because he knew about everybody in Rome. So, I think that they decided that they would get him befoe he could get them. And all of that came together to fuel Kaiser's means by which he was able to express the hatred and do as much damage as he felt he could do to Malachi. I just got deeper into the character of Malachi Martin. And so I wrote this book. It's called Clerical Error. And the error was not only his error, but mine in not being alive enough to the reality. I decided that this was too good a story to pass up and that only I could tell it, because only I had the whole story in hand Only I had the willingness to dig to the bottom of the story and get it out there. And so I thought it might even make a good movie. I would probably make a good documentary. Because it is a fascinating tale. True or not. He made it clear that reason why he left the Jesuit order, in particular was because in the 1930s, the Jesuits, as with a lot of other organisations back then, took a vey hard0eft turn, and I asked, I said, "So, you could say that after Vatican II, Mal, the Jesuits were in left field?" And he kind of smiled and said, "No, they weren't in left field. They were outside the baseball stadiem." Pope John said he thought that Malachi sould leave Rome. Not the priesthood but leave Rome. Because he said, "If you stay..." Iam saying this on camera, but anyway... "If you stay, you will become another fat cardinal with another mistress living outside of Rome." He thought the best way for him to remedy this from his own perspective was to get a document from Pope Paul VI that he called a rescript in Latin. What that did was release him from two of his three vows as a priest. It release him from the vow of obedience. So he could leave the Jesuit order. And It release him from the vow of poverty, because he would then be able to make his way pursuing a secular lifestyle as an author in the West. The only one of his vows that he kept to and maintained until he died was his vow of chasity. He maintained that until his death. Priests ae human beings, first of all. Human beings go through all sorts of changes of mood throughout their lives. Privacy and the respecting of someone's privacy is absoultely paramount. Because I know that the relationship between a priest and his superior includes all sorts of private information. And I know that priest are frequently given dispensations. I personally would like to see more evidence that he was released from two but not from three vows. i simply would find it unsual that ha had been realeased from two and not from the third. In 1964, I came over to America and became an American citizen, and I settle down in New York and I write books here. I do TV and radio. You have written a lot of books, and particularly the books concerning Roman Catholicism and the Vaticans. That's right. When he first came, he had no money, he had nothing. He earned money the way he could. He washed dishes and drove a cab. He did what he could to make a living. He worked at the Encyclopedia Britannica but he did not ike that. He said it was justing taking somebody else's knowledge and stuffing it in a book. He didn't want to do that. He wanted to his own work. So, that didn't work out for him. When I met him, it wasn't his plan to be a writer. And I began to talk to him about a writing career. I said that if he would give me a certain amount of time, I would make him a successful writer. But it takes time to do that. He and I worked together then for years. As friends, and first I was his editor and publisher, and when I left the publishing ide of publishing, to become an agent, he became my client. I say mass every morning. I'm a priest. I say my breviary. The usual things. That's about the sun total of it all. I've published 15 books. I am preparing a 16th. That's my life story. It's very uneventful. But it's my life. This is a man with a very clear anlysis of what is happening. He is putting words to people's sense of unease at the apparent implosion of this perfect, huge church, which, let's remember, until a few years previously, Catholicism was claiming it would be the official religion of America. Here comes Malachi Martin, with all his skills, analysis, intelligence and eloquence, giving answers, and that is why he made suh a huge impact and that's why many people found he was a natural leader for them. There is a new generation of people who don't know what they should believe. The Catholic Church's only strength was unity. Unity. It's gone. First off, people would kill to be with Malachi Martin. He meant a lot of people. He brought the faith to them. My first encounter with Father Martin was a result of a priest We both knew at St.Agnes Church in New York. We were chatting one evening and he said, "Would you like to meet Malachi? I know him. You can share a meal with him." We just got fairly well acquainted over the course of that dinner. In fact, it went so late that they politely asked us around 23:30 would we mind leaving the restaurant because the staff wanted to go home? He was that kind of storyteller. He was a very gentle, soft person. He had a charming Irish accent which absolutely fascinated me. I never knew him like an equal. To me, he was a mentor, he was an advisor, he was a spiritual director, somebody I looked up to. But he wasn't a friend, like a colleague on the same level. He was a friend, and a very dear friend. The fact that he was there when my daughter died. She was a newborn. She only lived two weeks. I wouldn't have been able to hold it together, I think, if Father Martin hadn't been there. And again, he didn't have to do that. It was the middle of the night. He jumped in a cab and came all the way downtown to be with us, and to accompany us, as we spent my daughter's final moments here, and as she... went on. Tonight, I want to get off on a little bit different tangent and talk about your past experiences as an exorcist. Yes, that is a fascinating thing. It's always fascinating for a lot of people. We must tell them beforehand that exorcism and possession is not a joy, is not a happy thing. Possession is a dirty, insalubrious, unhealthy, mucky and unpleasant situation where you come across it. But it is a necessary evil in the sense that we have to deal with it once we meet people with it. I met him one afternoon and he had a fresh cuton his forehead and I asked him what had hapened. He said he was at an exorcism and a foot stool came flying through the air and hithim in the head It's cost me a lot. it's cost me two broken legs. ...Almost broken kneecaps. And...a... It endangered my life several times. But I wasn't supposed to die. Not yet. And um... It cost me a lot of hate. A lot of my friends turned away. They wouldn't walk with me mo more, as the saying goes. You'll give but you'll never get back again. Some bit of you dies with every exorcism. With everything she does, some bit of her is consumed and goes away, I don't know where it goes. God stores it up for you and you are finally reunited but you lose that value that you use up. You're use up. It's all over. You pay a price for anything decent you do in this life. And you don't get it back. You're ennobled by it. Strengthened by it. Made more human by it. More noble. But you don't get it back. After the Second Vatican Council, a lot of people believed that the baby was thrown out with the bathwater. From...the integral centre of the faith was concerned. Malachi was one of them. He saw a lot of what he called "the nonsense" going on. And it also led to a general decline, basically, in people's beliefs in central things. Including the existence of evil and existence of the Devil. Because in the wake of all the changes in the 1960s, people wanted to focus on flowery love, forgiveness, puppies in the sunshine, and all that stuff. We find out the majority of bishops in this country didn't believe in the Devil, didn't believe in exorcism. Had dropped that idea. So we said we'd have an underground. We set up anunderground of exorcists throughout the country. And... we... That's how I got into it. I've stopped sending them to certain bishops now. They send them off to see a shrink, go to a home, rest up, get drugs. And it only makes them worse. Make it worse. it's a terrible plight. God and Satan cannot coexist. I mean you cannot you cannot worship both of them. You have to choose, Malachi often said that Satan and Christ divide the world between them. And the Church needs to make it very clear who she is and what she stands for. "When the Church asks publicly and authoritatively in the name of Jesus Christ that a person or an object be protected against the power of the evil one, and withdrawn from his dominion, it is called exorcism. Exorcism is directed at the expulsion of demons or to the liberation from demonic possession through the spiritual authority with which Jesus en trusted his church." In the Catholic ceremony of exorcism, we perform an exorcism, not a type of exorcism or a blessing. It is an exorcism. There are two types of exorcism in the Catholic Church. The type that we perform at every baptism and then the type we don't talk about very often. We were taught as children that God existed and that the Devil existed, and that God was more powerful than the Devil. I know that... he can't be quite as candid as he was with us cos there's tapes and there's video. But he is going to be very open. I was going to classes with Ed and Lorraine Warren. Lorraine siad, "Next week, Malachi Martin is coming to speak with us." I had no idea who he was. She said he was an exorcist. I thought, that's the coolest thing ever. i can't wait. I specifically chose to sit in the back of the room because I didn't want to hog the spotlight in the front. He spoke for an hour and a half or so. At the end, a few of us got in line to get our books autographed or say hi. He immediately kept staring at me down the line. and... I thought, oh, boy. When he finally got to me, he pointed to me "Were you sitting in that back corner there?" I said "yes", He said, " You were distracting me the whole time." I said "what?" He says, "You have a glow about you. You are throwing off lights like I have never seen before." He said, "You are my favorite person in this room right now." He goes, "It's an honour to meet you." An honour to meet me? He made me feel so special that day that I still remember whathe said. I think about all the time. They...lionized him. They brought him to the various churches around the USA and paid him nice lecture fees. They got him book contracts to write these funny books. They weren't funny. They were just weird. Books that told these people what they wanted to hear. He parlayed this into profit. My name is Ralph Sarchie. Iam a retired New York City police sergeant. also a demonologist. Father Malachi Martin was my mentor When I first started out in what I call "work." Iam a religious demonologist, meaning that I approach this field from a religious point of view. I've assisted at exorcism. And I investigates of demonic activity and demonic possession. Usually, Iam the first guy to go in there to see if it's a genuine case. If it is, then we set up an exorcism. All through my career, I saw a lot of crazy things, But it wasn't what I experiences as a cop that led me into the field of demonology. It was more of an interest that went a lot further than just reading books. I actually got involved in it and I was involved with all the right people in order to get to the point when I am at in the field. I try not to get emotionally involved with my cases. I can make mistakes when that happens. I get emotionally involved with people to a certain degree. Because you know, As Father Martin says, in the studies that he did, there is no common denominator between all of these people who have had genuine cases of possession or genuine cases of infestation in their homes. There is no common denominator between these peolple except for one thing : they all suffer. It's the suffering that's difficult, because... sometimes I get a case and it takes me a few months to get there. So...this is um... one of the cops at work arrested this guy. I think, the guy was theatening him -Is there more coffee there? Well, I look at this way : God puts people in your path to teach you and to direct you in what he needs. And to serve his will properly. And Father Martin had that place. Basically, it was selfishness on my part, the way I bacame his de facto driver because he knew I had a perfectly good working Jeep and that we had a great time whenever we were together, talking, chatting, sharing either a burger or a pizza. Whatever. And I just made it known to him, I said : "Mal, if you ever need to go anywhere, I'd like mine to be the first number you dial. Because I am going to pick up and it's always going to be a yes." I had spoken with Father Martin years prior about children. And the things that he had told me is that... God is going to allow more children to become possessed genuinely because of a chastisement towards the parents. And he said : "when you start to see that happening, that's when there is a turning point." So I have been watching and I have seen a rise in child possession. Basically, within the last few years. We also have this new phenomenon called the demonic possession of children. -Demonic possession of children? -Three, four, five, six. -Good heavens. -Very frightening. Very fightening. That morning, when I got a phone call from Father Malachi, I actually thought that he was calling to confirm our birthday lunch that was going to happen in a couple of weeks. Instead, he asked me would I be willing I already knew the way, having been up there several times. So I said : "sure, I'd be happy to." while we were on the way up there, I said : "What's the main reason for us coming up here today?" He said : "You are going to drop me off, because...two hours after you drop me off, there will be a family arriving and they have with them their small daughter, and she is apparently very severely afflicted with something, they believe, to be demonic." I said : "Well, it's good thing Iam dropping you off two hours ahead of time. Because I don't want to be anywhere near it." For me to go back up there is basically to bring a degree of calm to my soul. If anything else. Because... I didn't know what the subsequent events were going to be after we went up to Connecticut. He probably had a good idea but he didn't tell me the whole length and breadth of it. There's very little truth known about the Devil. We do know from the Church and from scripture that Satan was one of the brightest and most intelligent of the archangels. Now, he did, though, rebel. And apparently, there was a battle between the good angels, led by Michael the archangel, against Lucifer, the light-bearer, the son of the dawn. So, he was defeated and condemned to what we call "hell". As far as we know, God does love purity. He does love compassion. He loves beauty. Look at the beautiful things, he has created in nature. But, God, in all those things, he has one great preference. Repentance. He loves to exercise mercy. How could he do that unless people who are tempted and he had forgive them? He didn't want a perfect world. He wanted to have a world in which he could exercise mercy. So he gave Satan the power of tempting man. I'm told that there's a Devil. The Bible said so. Jesus even said so. The Pope often refers to the Devil as a real person. For all my love of Pope Francis, I do not. But Iam not prepared to say that he's wrong and I'm right. I will find out. I look forward to my days very soon...when I will embarked on a new adventure, finding out the answers to all these questions that I've had all my life and didn't know the answers to. If you deny the Devil, if you deny the existence of Lucifer, if you deny the existence of sin, of hell, eternal punishment, you automatically deny Christ's salvation. In fact, you can't deny the existence of Lucifer without being led inevitably to deny the divinity and function of Christ, our saviour. What's the purpose in Christ coming? To make a nice land, to give us happy lives? No, no! He came to save us from sin. S-I-N. The Church exists to answer real needs. If those needs are not answered, people simply walk away and find the answers they are looking for. I can imagine a situation, in the atmosphere of the 1970s in New York, where those needs were being expressed, people were being turned away by priests, being told that we'd moved on from those old superstitions. And yet people hadn't moved on from that sense of affliction. If those people, or even one of them presented themselves to Malachi Martin, I have no doubt that he would respond, pastorally, as a priest. When a human being is possessed, what is the purpose of the possession of an indivisual? The destruction of that indivisual's soul to such a point that it must end up in hell. I think everyone has their own personal beliefs about God and the Devil and spirituality. But in terms of trying to convince anyone, I don't think we'd ever be successful in convincing anyone. Because there is still no real hardcore evidence. We can't point to, "There's the Devil right there". We have no picture of him. I think people are going to be sceptical, until they see that picture. And that's OK. Scepticism is a healthy thing. I would encourage that. Don't accept anything at face value. Question, question, question. By turns he woould be talkative, and by other turns he wouldn't be introspective and get kind of quiet. And as we got closer, between him and I, there was an unspoken tension. We could feel that we were approaching something. And... You know, he had heard my confession, my full confession, about half an hour before, So there was nothing weighing on my conscience. But still... between the both of us, there was really a sense of foreboding. And I couldn't explain why. My name is Matt Baglio. I'm the author of The Rite: The Making Of A Modern Exorcist. Rom is really the capital of exorcism in many ways. I heard about this exorcism course, which is really what brought me into this topic of exorcism. Before beginning the book, I didn't know anything about exorcism. I was very surprised by a lot of the things I learned. Here, in Italy, there is probably 20 people undergoing an exorcism in Rome right now. Thisexorcism course that we have here in Rome, in our university, was invented by a layman. This gave me also the opportunity to work to work with a famous, at least in Italy, very famous exorcist called Father Gabriele Amorth. We try to give a general outlook of exorcism. So we speakon the rite... and it's a liturgic part. But we also speak on the medical aspects to try to help the priest to understand the difference between schizophrenia and the possession. Between a person that is on the drugs or on depression and true possession. Today, the hierarchy of the Church - who some support this course and some don't - I think, want a more cautious approach. They want to embrace modern medicine and modern science but at the same time, not discount their own past and their own belief that exorcism is necessary in certain rare instances. One of the topics of this course was to try and reintroduce priests to the traditional teachings of the Catholic Church on a topic like the Devil. There's many Catholic priests who don't believe in exorcism. I found that surprising. They don't believe in the Devil as a personified entity. Because the were thinking of things like Hollywood films and such. It's very easy to laughat that and say, well, I don't believe in that either. They were trying to remind priests that... this is something the Church believes in and goes back to the Bible. We see that Christ, he was the first exorcist. He had many encounters with persons possessed by the Devil. We can read this scripture. And he was able to cast out demons. Then he gave this power to hus disciples. The disciples were also able to cast out demons. "No one my lawfully exorcise the possessesd without the special and express permission of the local ordinary. Jesus performed exorcisms, and from him, the Church has received the power and office of exorcising. The solemn exorcism, called a major exorcism, can be performed only by a priest and with the permission of the bishop. The priest must proceed with prudence, strictly observing the rules established bu the Church. Illness, especially psychological illness, is a very different matter. Treating this is the concern of medical science. Therefore, before an excorcism is performed it's important to ascertain that one is dealing with the presence of the Evil One and not with an illness. Anneliese Michel died of starvation at 23. A religious student who spoke in stange voices, doctors said she had epilepsy. But she thought it was the Devil. [woman mutters demonically] And so did a panel of priests who recorded the voices. The priests who followed this 17th century ritual believed that it worked, that Annelieses was spiritually healed when she died. But a Bavarian prosecutor says this bishop, who authorised the exorcism, the priests who performed it, and the parents who allowed it, could face criminal-neglect charges for failing to get medical help for the starving woman. With science, you start with an open tablet. And open slate. And everything is included, and you just go along, and exclude different variables as you can. Each one was very different. Each one was very specific and individualised. So, I would try to rule out mental illness. Just rule out different factors. Cognitive functioning. Any psychotropic medications. Ill side effects they may be experiencing, if at all. I am not afraid on the sceptics because Iam also a sceptic on myself. I don't believe that just any person that arrives, "I'm possessed." I am very sceptical. And normal priest should be, in a true sense, very sceptical. To really grasp what it is. And I can tell you that in my experiences, as an exorcist, more than 90% of the persons that arive to me as an exorcist telling me that they have problems with the Devil, they have no problems with the Devil at all. People say they are possessed all the time. It doesn't make it true. You have to rule it out. Or rule it in. [child] Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb. And he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spoke and saw And all the people were amazed and said : "Is this not the son of David?" But when the Pharisees heard, they said: "This fellow doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of devils." And Jesus knew their thoughts and said unto them: "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to dissolution. Every city or house divided against itself shall not stand. And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How shall then his kingdom stand? And if I, by Beelzebub, cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them? Therefore, they shall be your judges." We now know that there are people who programmed children at the age of two, reinforced it at seven, confirmed it at 14 and 21. Programmed to... to worship Lucifer. They become Luciferians. They're turned out by the thousands every years. we know who does it, who'll do it, we know when they do it, but we can't do anything about it. It's a free country. It comes in various way. The television has a lot to do with it. Music has a lot to do it. We have made a statistical survey of the possessed people we've known and there are a lot of them. There's no ... ethnic, there's no religious, there's no gender, there's no intellectual, there's no economic, there's no rule. It's of some peculiar alchemy inside. Because it creeps up to you slowly. Satan doesn't appear with a scroll and says: "You can have all these things if you sell your soul to me." Faustian, Mephistopheles. It's not like that. It's the simply things slowly but surely. And the possession then becomes so that at a certain moment... ...you are under the command of something that takes possession of your will bit by bit. It's a slow process. Until one day, you can't say no and you are possessed. You are no longer free to choose. How do you know a perfectly possessed person? It's a leading question. Its a very easy question to answer in one sense. That... is the test. By tests. You know some, OK? You might get involved with them. You might even go to bed with her. You work in the office with him, you know him socially, and you know him, you think, until one day, something happens and... [whistles] ...you suddenly see a person you never knew. It's momentary. The window on the camera opens into reality. You'll see it and then it's closed again. That's the way you know it. Otherwise, they can be good fathers, they can be good statesmen. They can be good bankers. They can have sexual probity. Everything. But they're possessed. Completely given over to Satan. Malachi told me many times. He said that he thought, as a society, the West and the world were heading towards some kind of tipping point. He fully expected that possibly during his lifetime, or after, what he used to refer to as, "after I'm playing the harp," that there was going to come some kind of event that would define the end of what he called the Catholic era as we know it. And because of that, he said various events would be happening. And possession, things like possessions, would naturally increase as well. I am sure you've all read that passage in the Book of Deuteronomy where God says: "This day, there are two courses open to you. And I'm telling you which one to follow." On the one hand, you can choose life and goodness. One the other hand, you can choose death and evil. I truely believe that what I'm seeing now with all the things that I've heard, all the things that I've read about, this is the lull before the storm. Because I see us being taken in a direction that father Martin basically described. I don't like it one bit what's going on. Over all and eveywhere, throughout our community of nations today, numbering roughly about five billion, and chiefly by legalised abortion but also by contraception, by euthanasia, by condoned infanticide, by deliberately formenting civil wars, by endemic hunger, by the floods of refugees, never before in the history of man has the lifeblood of so many been shed so violently, so mercilessly wasted as in our day. We specialise in the death of masses as a community of nations today, and we belong to that community whether we like it or not. So, anti-life, surely, that's us We are anti-life. Bloodstained guilt, surely. Every 24 hours, we widen that dark red pool of human blood. We do. We do. There's nothing underground with this. You gotta see it. If you don't have faith and you don't have spirituality, you're not gonna see it. Your gonna miss all the miracles of the supernatural. And you're going to miss all the reverse miracles of the preternatural. And... Open your eyes. Find God and you'll see. Lucifer has the most amazing PR. He doesn't exist. ...World War Two, which we were fighting, was never to be known. He has madeit so he doesn't exist. The film business heading could read "The Devil knocks out the mafia." For in US and Canada cities, the old box-office champ The Godfather is being flattened by that movie about diabolical possession, The exorcist. There was a very funny picture called The Exorcist, based on a book by William Blatty, which was totally erroneous as regards exorcism. It's a phony, phony exorcism. It makes out exorcism to be a combination of Frankenstein and Dracula with a lot of green goo, and windows breaking and bodies flying. It's much more terrible and lethal than that. Everything you see in The Exorcist can happen. But it could happen in an exorcist over a lifetime... It would be almost unheard-of that it would appear in a single indivisual in one single case. So, the movie tend to condense a lot of phenomena. I know one exorcist who told me he has once only seen levitation in 20 years as an exorcist. Right? But he has seen it. He saw a child floating around the floor. When we were publishing "Hostage To The Devil", because Tony was such a good friend of Peter Blatty, we had some difficulty there. They required Malachi to get a letter from the Pope saying that what he was, what he said he was, and exorcism was what it said it was. And Malachi got a letter from Paul VI. And Peter Blatty, when he heard about this, just hit the ceiling. He just... Exorcism was his. And not only did he not write a blurb for the book, he wrote a review of the book in the Los Angeles Times, the opening line of which was, "I hate this book." When I wrote that book in 1975, I wrote it for one reason only. I wrote it because I found my contemporaries in America and Canada and Australia and Ireland had forgotten what it was all about. They didn't know it existed any more. So I decided, as I was in that field, doing a lot of work, that I would get and publish the transcripts of five to ten exorcisms and publish them as such with a preface. So I read Malachi Martin's book early on. It definitely made an impression on me. It's a very dramatic portrayal of exorcism. There's no doubt about it. Here he was, a Catholic priest, writing about a topic that many people didn't know anything about, and whatever want to say about "Hostage To The Devil", it's definitely a gripping read. Even today. My name is John Zaffis. I'm a paranormal investigator and demonologist. I've been involved with the field for 42years, investigating a lot of different claims of hauntings, and the possibility of possession. You know, years ago, people used to look forward to sitting down, reading a book and "Hostage To The Devil" is probably one of the very first books I was reading in regards to some of this work. And I finally had the opportunity to meet him when he was speaking at a small event. He would have this look, you notice with a lot of spiritual people. They're trying to get a good sense of you. You have to remember, when you get involved with this field, it's so important to be able to be guarded and carefully with the people you associated yourself with. Because people will go after you in a heartbeat you know, be able to tear you down. He was on a downward spiral of more and more myths. "Hostage To The Devil" was an account of his... ...efforts to cast the Devil out of various people who had been... ...possessed by the Devil. And by all critical accounts, his account didn't really stand up. It did exremely well. As time went on, it outsold "The Exorcist". and is still in print and still on sale. It has sold well over a million copies. It appealed to his romantic nature to have a romantic tale to tell. He did very well. He sold a few books. More than a few. On one hand, you could say he was always interested in the most sensational story that he could make up. On the other hand, there are those who think he, Malachi Martin himself, somewhat possessed by the Devil. And... for him to cast himself in the role of someone who could cast devils out was a really neat trick. -Have you ever been possessed? -No, thank God. Some of the critics think maybe you were when you wrote this book. Well, may the Lord cure me if I have been possessed. I doubt that you have been. There is one thing that people have to understand. He broke ground. He went public. He started doing appearances and radio shows, talking about this topic. Demonology. Possession. These things exist. These things do happen. He was crucified, basically, behind the scenes, with the Church, with people ridiculing him. "Misrepresentation, falsehood, and imagination gone berserk all in the elaboration and defence of a particular thesis." Well, do you know what Ben Jonson said, when somebody said similar words about a work of his? He said: "When a gentleman throws mud at me, I know he has only got mud to throw." You know, I don't respond to critics. I don't really care what critics have to say. I believe that Father Martin felt the same way. We more interested in pleasing God than pleasing our fellow man. If you mention God, they want to boo you. If you mention Jesus, they want to boo you. They want to take it out of the Pledge of Allegiance. And... the Ten commandments, and all this. But you know what, oddly enough, "In God we trust" is on our money. I don't see anybody throwing that away. So, you know what, if you don't believe in God, and you want to remove all of... then take every penny you have and give it away! Right now! Don't wait. Give it away. Because God's name is on the money. You're a hypocrite at that time. Walk the walk. I never met the man in person that I interviewed him for countless hours on the radio. I was very fortunate. We became close friends. I don't think you could listen to Malachi and not have a strong opinion, one way or the other. I've received a lot... not a lot, a few angry, very angry, faxes. I'm sure you have. I'm sure you have. "How dare you, Art, expose the audience to this... old-fashioned, put-the-fear- of-God-in-them hellfire-and brimstone-- people are vey angry. They are. I know they are very angry. But as I say, my reading of the really, really, really angry ones... is that this disturbs their way of life. This manifests "a weakness". This tells the truth about the way that they live and they don't like to be reminded of it. He certainly brought it off very well. He made lots of money, writing these books, and making many appearances on radio and television. However, what did it all add up to? Huge disappointment on the part of those who finally saw through him. Father Martin, where can I write to you? Following address. Take it. 217 East 66th Street, New York, New York. He gave out his personal information because he wanted to help people. Do I think it was a good idea? No. I warned him very carefully that this might not be such a good idea. I did that because of the thousands of emails that I receive daily. I knew what it was in for. The phone was ringing off the hook. I looked at the answering machine, wondering why it wasn't answering. And it said, 99. I began to listen to the messages. Of course, it was everybody... thought that they were possessed and wanted to talk to him. And I called Malachi and asked what had gone on He apologised and he said: "I didn't want to give my number so I gave yours. I promise I'll never do it again." I don't think I've ever met a person with such strong charisma. He drew you in. Very, very charming. Highly intelligent. Well-versed on so many topics, in the worldly sphere as well as the spiritual sphere. I did hear it from the other side, because I heard from a couple of people who were absolutely devastated because he sort of pelled the plug on the relationship. So, I know how much it hurt the people when that happend. Then, of course, I dreaded that that might happen to me. I don't know what else I can say, but, it's true, yes, people obviously must have gotten to be too possessive. And I can see why. He was absolutely tantalising. He was a charming guy who told very witty stories. Some of them even fairly obscene. Because he was so unusual, most of us around our dinner tables would give him a pass. We would say: "That's Malachi. He's just being Malachi." Unfortunately, men being men, Malachi Martin being a man, Malachi Martin... "fell in love", at least he said he did, with my wife. So, they began an affair. I didn't want to think that he was having an affair with my wife. Therefore for a good long time, I was in denial. So... he was just a liar and a scoudrel and a cheat. I'm glad that I will be judged by our Lord Jesus because I don't want to be judged by anyone I'd be condemned to hell by them. Because I'm a filthy pig. [nervous laughter] I know me x2 better than anybody. I know I don't deserve a darn thing. I never saw an ego and I was driving with him I said to him: "Father, I want to attain your holiness." and he said, "to me?" "I'm a wretched pig in the eyes of God." I almost crashed the car. "If you're a wetched pig, then I'm finished." There's no way that I'm attaining heaven. I know this for a fact. But he's a warrior. He was a warrior for God and he still is a warrior for God. Started out back in 1984. Graduated from Catholic univercity with a degree in Soviet studies, interestingly enough. From there, I went to work for the US Goverment into the Center Intelligence Agency. I stayed there till '97. A lot of the work was highly classified, so I'm not really at liberty to talk a whole lot about it. It's very strange but I haven't been up here in years. And I'm feeling some of those feelings right now. So... its very, very mixed feelings. Feelings of fear. I always felt there was a limited amount to what could do to protect him. Because after a while, I just came to realise what he was up against was not something a goverment badge or a weapons going to do anything against. You know, the goverment can train you do all kinds of things. But for things that are in the world we can't see, they don't train you for that. He always reffered to NYPD involvement in exorcism as being a very oblique thing. Only because he couldn't take the chance that someone with loose lips was going to run to the New York Daily News or the New York Post and make the claim that the New York Police Dept was helping to cast demons out of people. So, his involvement with the New York City Police Dept would have been probably more along the lines of his interaction with people like Ralph Sarchie. But it was never an official policy that the NPYD would ever call in an exorcist. All of these are my notes. What this is all about. Sometimes it's difficult but most of the times you know because of the way the person behaves, you know they are not mentally ill. There's something else. And a good exorcist and a good investigator will get to the bottom of that. It might take time but it can be done. [moaning] So it must be a priest and he must have authority from the bishop. I know bishops. We've gone to them and said: "Look, John so-and-so or Mary so-and-so they needs exorcism, your Honor, your Excellency," but a lot of it is left up to the exorcist. At a certain moment, I must turned around and say to you, to the possessed person. "Who are you?" An exorcist never answers the question of a possessed person. You keep at it and find their names. All of the names. Ugly names. Sinister names. Sardonic names. Once you do that, you have them nailed. Because then they obey that name. They act on counsel of that name. Then you proceed to find out who sent them, how did they cime here, when, what's your speciality, what do you do? It's like a dog trying to get away from you. It'll bite your hand. It'll bite you mortally if you're not careful. It's amazing how weak people are when facing the supernatural. Because once the supernatural manifests itself, I've seen strong men collapse in tears. It's just too much. Too much. It's very frightening. If they measure thier intelligence with his intelligence, they're going to be taken captive. Malachi Martin had a very deep relationship with would never deceive him about anything so... when Rama Coomaraswamy called him up and asked Malachi to caome up and meet this young girl... Malachi didn't hesitate. Especially since there was a child at stake here. Because a child that young cannot make a choice for evil with full consent of the will. can't do it. Picture a little kid like that. She can't make a choice like that. That, by the way, that's the other reason why a child like that could never become perfectly possessed. In order to perfectly possessed, as Malachi would've put it, you have to give your full consent of the will. He was not adventure-seeking. He knew the dangers. He knew the perils but he was not in any shape to do that exorcism. Physically and spiritually, perhaps he did not have adequate protection, either. But he put himself on the line and in the line of danger because there was a little girl and the family didn't have or didn't feel they had other recourse. The first feeling I had was dread. And it was building dread. And I can't explain why. It was like I mentioned. I knew that at the Catholic Church would put it, I was in a state of grace. I had nothing to really worry about. But still... I think we have all been in those situations where... you feel a gnawing sense of unease. And it just kept building. It just kept building and building. It's power over the will. You don't wake up in the morning and say: "gee whiz, I've been possessed." It's always a slow process to which you consent. If you open your heart to Satan, he'll accept the invitation. It's not... He won't refuse. If someone is going to allow him in, he'll take it. he'll take the opportunity. I asked your disciples to cast him out, and they were not able. and he asked them: "O, faithless generation, how long am I to be with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring to me." They brought the boy to him, and when the spirit saw him, immediately, he convulsed the boy. He fel on the ground and rolled about, foaming at the mouth. Jesus asked his father: "How long has he had this?" He said: "From childhood." [sighs] 17 years. 17 years and at this moment, it feels like it fucking happened yesterday Here we are. Oddly enough, I got a tightness in the chest as we approach the house. I also know that it's mixed with a lot of sadness. I mean, on a very real human level, we're talking about a man who, you know... for the many years I knew him, 11, 12... he was family to me. He was family. And now I'm approaching the point at which he came face to face with something that none of us have ever encountered, that was ultimately responsible for taking his life. So I feel a mixture of sadness, a mixture of apprehension, fear and anger at what happened to him. It took my friend, it took my goddamn best friend away. He was my best friend. Jesus. Funny thing is, I just thought I'd be a whole lot calmer. My heart is racing like a goddamn drum. We pulled in. Their van was right there. Actually, it was a Ford Explorer. We drove up and I just said to Malachi: "Is that them?" Because they were milling about. I said: "They are not supposed to be here." He didn't say anything and I, at that point, I just knew by the look on his face that was them. Can you sit in that chair for a second? -Why? -Because, Focus. I was with a group that investgated haunted houses. We almost all had specialities, we had a doctor, a nurse, a psychologist. I was more of a videographer. I would take pictures, take video. help restrain. A producer from ABC came across our website. We had a featured article about a possible possession case we were working on. They asked if we were interested in doing a primetime special on that, we said, of couse we're interested. This is about 20-25 years ago. There were no shows on TV. This was all before the paranormal investigators. I think we were trailblazers but even in doing the invetigations, examinations and assessments of the people, I didn't have a role model for that. There was no textbook that you can just open up and study. I just kind of learned at I went along through experience with the different cases, with the different families, and with the different people involved. There were certain people in the group that felt all the cases that came to us were possessed. I personally did not feel that way. My personal opinion and my professional opinion at that point, I ruled out a significant number of those cases. If you're asking for a ratio, I would say probably close to two-thirds I would rule out. This is outr first exorcism we ever were in volved with. We actually went to the house. It wasn't in the church. We didn't know what was going to happen because the girl didn't believe she was possessed. We weren't sure either, she said "I probably won't have any reaction." But that morning, I was just a very angry feeling in that room, very cold, the temperature in the room dropped many, many times. It would vary up and down, up and down. As soon as the priest started doing his litany of the saints, she started moving around in her chair and screaming, breaking out of her restraints and she just stoop up like this, broke out of every restraint we had and went towards the priest. She was trying to gouge her own eyes out. During that point, I tried restrain her own hands from doing that. She bit me. We both got out of the car at the same time. I went around to him and he said: "Let's do some introdutions and then you can leave." We got out and walked over towards where they were. The introductions were made. And then... this little child, she just walks up to Malachi over here. She just looks up at him and she says: "You're Father Malachi and you think you're going to help her." At that point, I just knew that I was up against something that nothing had ever trained me for. And Malachi just kept on acting like she was a perfectly normal little girl. I knew something was off. Did I know she was possessed? No. But I knew something was off. We are talking about a four-year-old child. She was innocence personified. There was no reason why this kid should've been afflicted in this way. Malachi just kind of gave me "the look", as in, "This is my turf now, Bob, You don't need to be here. You shouldn't be here." It was not my place to be in there at all. One of the realities or the characteristics that you need to see if a person is possessed is one of the signs. You need four signs. An extraordinary strength. The knowledge of ancient languages. Fear of sacred things. And the knowledge of hidden or very far-away things. I think that the three first can be invented. I can fake an extraordinary force. I can talk to you in Latin or Greek. Because I remember it from school. I can fake that I'm afraid of the crucifix. I can fake it. But what I cannot invent or cannot fake is to know things that really happened in your life that's just absolutely impossible fir me to know. Well, you always go to the commonsense. Maybe she heard us talking. Or she heard a conversation that we had. Or maybe her mother knew something about us that she just inadvertenly blurted out to her. Maybe she read something about us on the internet, on the website. You try to have those commonsense approach things. But sometimes you just know there's no way they could've known that. There are very personal things about our families, personal events that have happened that morning. There's no possible way. Something I didn't even talk about with my colleagues. How would they know that? I can't explain it. One of the things that convinced me that there's something to this, in very rare cases, there is something to this, beyond simple superstition or active imagination, was the fact that I was able to interview people who were not Catholic priests, who were sceptics, who were scientists, who themselves had these experiences. And they couldn't explain them. And there were matching up with what, the exorcists were saying, they were seeing themselves. The real horror, the real pain, what hurts in possession in the presence of the Evil One. And when we start an exorcism, within the first 20 minutes, we know whether it's genuine or not. Seddenly, it becomes evident. How evident Like an indivisual animal clawing at you with claws you can't escape. There are physical manifestations like change in temperature, smells, odours, objects flying around, and then there's violence on the part of the possessed person at times. They have to be held down. Thats's why you have assistants who are not afraid. Because a lot of people the moment they enter their first exorcism, it scares them, it's the most unhealthy, insalubrious mucky, dirty, inhuman activity you could participate in, but we must in order to save these people. The exorcist and his assistants and the possessed person are in the presence of something that hates us in a way that you've never felt hated before. When you get beyond the sensational, like I did, when I was watching these exorcisms, it's one of the things that really stand out in your mind, These people are suffering. And you, from a human level, you want to help them get better. We are tested oftentimes. And that morning was no different. That exorcism went on for a number of hours, I believe. But afterwards, there was such a change in the room. It was absolutely beautiful. I can't, words cannot even describe the change. When they first approached us, I think we were more excited to be on TV. And after it came out, we saw the impact that it had and how many people were in need around the country. They said, they can't find help in their area. We are talking about real people who are suffering. Real people who want healing. Those people deserve peace. Those people implore for peace that only the Church can give when they are in these grave situations. I came back for him two hours later. At the time, it was a beautiful summer day. I came down the driveway in my Jeep. I just remember there was a Ford Explorer. It was a tan vehicle. It was parked right about here, caddy-corner almost facing that house in the background. And everyone was out, starting to say their goodbyes. I saw them proceeding out from the house in the back there. I pulled up right over here. And I got and I saw Malachi talking to the parents first. And then the parents were getting in the vehicle and they were helping the little child into the vehicle into the back seat, and the mother had rolled the window down, and Malachi, after he had said goodbye to the parents, he had walked over to say goodbye to the child, and I remember when the window went down, just as he got there to the window, as the glass came down, I remember her face kind of framed in the window. And she just blew him a kiss, it was disgusting, lascivious, it was like something was defiling innocence at that moment. The kind of way you imagine a whore blowing a kiss to a John who had just paid her hundred bucks. That's what it was. Malachi was completely nonplussed. It is exremely rare for a four-year-old to have a mental illness at that age. I don't know the particulars of this case but if she was sexually provocative at the age four. That could be a learned behaviour through sexual abuse. But again, at the age of four, it's very rare for a child of that age for it to be explained by mental illness. Or again, substance abuse. Substance-induced psychosis. Schizophenia. Things of that nature. To the sceptics, I would say that the people that I met that day, they seemed like in every way, the all-American family. There was nothing to indicate anything like that Something went on in the conversations inside the house that convinced a senior exorcist of the Roman Catholic Church and Dr.Rama Coomaraswamy, an actual medical psychiatrist, that something was afflicting this girl that was not of this world and could not be explained by modern medical science. We went up the driveway and I said: "So, do you think it's an authentic case of possession, Mal?" And he said: "I've got no doubt. But this one is going to be difficult." I remember my phrase for that was, hammer and tongs. I said: "You're talking hammer and tongs?" He said: "Yeah." Then he just kind of nodded and he was quiet for a while, as we drove off. People would be inclined to think that the hostage is the person possessed. But actually, no, it's the priest who goes the exorcism. Malachi had been the subject of several heart operations. He always tried to come across as very robust. But you know these things, exorcisms, they have to take a toll on you. Once you realise you are dealing with a reallity here then you realise there is a price to be paid and every exorcism took a little chunk out of his life. For Malachi, his own personal health was never a concern to him. It was of paramount concern to the people around him. He was told by the doctor to take it easier and to cut out a lot of what he was doing. But it's an element of the true priest needs to be another Christ, that is what he is called to be. To lay your life on the line. The more he would help people, the more he would become a target. It affects their personal lives, it affects everything about them. And it's a very isolating world. The phone rang that morning and it was Malachi's voice on the other end, speaking in a very strained, weak voice. His exact words were, "Bob, I've taken a bit of a tumble." I said: "What do you mean?" He said: "I've hit my head. I was reaching for a book, standing on a stool in my study, and I had the stool knocked out from under me." "What do you mean, it was pushed out from under you?" He said:"Old Scratch wasn't terribly happy with what we just did up in Connecticut." I know that person said that he claimed that someone pushed him. What is unclear about that, of course, is whether it was an evil spirit or a human. Some said that he was pushed off the ladder. Done in because he had this terrible history behind him. They wanted to shut him up. I know it was horrific. He said he wanted me to know that he hadn't fallen, it wasn't a fall. This creature had grabbed him just above his ankle and caused him to fall. When he went to the hospital, he lapsed into a coma. They were restrcting the access of people into his room, a semi-private room in Lennox Hill Hospital. I'm not ashamed to say I was bawling like a little child. Here was my best friend in a coma. I knew he wasn't hearing me with his ears. Hopefully, he was hearing me with his soul. I had a tremendous sense in that room that a struggle was continuing. Even though he was comatose. That's why the prayers that we made and we sent to protect him were so important. About a day and a half later, I just got a call, I believe, from his agent, Lila, that Malachi had passed away. I remember just hanging up the phone and going into my office at home and just praying the rosary immediately for his soul. "We have the intent to want to receive God. Doesn't hold any weight with Jesus?" When I heard that he had passed on to his final reward, because that's he got, I was sad to see him go and it scared me a little bit because I lost my mentors now. It's like, uh oh, you know? What do I do now if I come upon something that I don't know? But I miss him and I would like to talk to him and I still do talk to him. [laughter ] I think he knew what he was doing he knew the risks and yet he went for it. Personally, I feel it was a great victory for the Adversary. I think that he was taken too soon and ... prematurely. The Adversary hit its mark in that. So, it was a great tragedy. Father Martin had told me about this particular case. The girl was four-years-old at the time. When she was eight, four years later, I assisted at her exorcism. This girl needed years and years of exorcism. There was no doubt about that. We weren't dealing with a demon. We were dealing with the Devil here and he was very, very powerful. She spoke fluent Latin during that exorcism. I can produce eight-year-old children that can speak fluent Latin but they're traditional, they're been trained since first grade on how to speak Latin. I know this particular girl didn't have that background. She was actually. -Who taught you that? -No one. -No one? -No one. -Not your fatheror anybody? -No. How do you know it, then? Mmm...I just know it. Speaking in a language that is not known previously to that person is a surefire sign of demonic possession. From what I seen during the exorcism, We did get that proof right out of the playbook of the Roman ritual. This particular case was definitely on a different level. I do hope that she did find the relief that she sought. Most of all, I hope her soul belongs to God at this moment, no matter what her physical condition is. I hope that her soul belongs to God. I adjure you, Devil. -You want me to say it? -Yeah. I adjure you, Devil. -To be gone. -To be gone. -And leave me alone. -And leave me alone. -Now and for ever. -Now and for ever. -I hate you. -I hate you. -And you are a Devil. -And you are a Devil. Amen. If you contact the HQ of the Jesuits in Rome, the Jesuit curia. which is a large building in the shadow of the Vatican, they will give you a number of facts, if they choose to give you any information at all. They'll tell you that Malachi Martin was a Jesuit priest. They'll tell you that he was in Rome between certain dates but there are not certain of the role or the authority which he had. They will tell you that he did, at a stage, work on the Dead Sea Scrolls. According to the Jesuits, when Malachi Martin left Rome in 1965, he was no longer a priest. Malachi Martin had no right legitimately to perform exorcisms unless by express permission from the local bishop. It's hard for some characters to get off the stage. If you know when to get off the stage, still leaving some questions in mind of the audience, you've done pretty well. According to the Jesuits, Father Martin no longer a priest when he left them in '65. basically, once you're a priest, you're always a priest. Father Martin never renounced his vows. As a matter of fact, he probably strengthened them from the outside of the Church. Which is where God wanted him. They don't like it. That's the truth. You know, I think we're all blessed with intuition and instinct. So, when we walk into a room and there is someone afflicted in that room, you know it, you feel it, you see it. Sometimes you know it because you even see the person, before you even go into the room. Sometimes you know it when you are driving up to the house. It's just a gut feeling. I believe that to be all the source within us responding to what source is not. I've noticed in all the evidence I have tried to present to the public they are either gonna believe or not gonna believe. It's very hard to change somebody's beliefs. But just getting the word out is all you can do. And you can help somebody along the way, that's great. I've been doing this for 20 years. If I helped one person who was genuinely possessed, it's all worth it. These are very, very sophisticated spirits who are there to harm us. And they are real. One thing that I've noticed is that since his death, interest in his work and in him has not really diminished. He was absolutely confident in everything he said. And he used the means at his disposal, which were the media, to get the message across. So it was his confidence in what he was saying that really struck me. And there is a certain element of mystery. He was a fascinating man. He also said a lot of things to me in private. We did talk a great deal. And he shared some of those which I cannot share with you or anybody because I promised. What he did say: "If you want something chilling, imagine the very worst you can imagine and then I will tell you that it's going to be much worse than that." I think that if one looks at these tapes, we may touch on the evidence that we now have that Satan is having his last stand. This is his Waterloo and he is going to kill a lot, destroy much, scorched-earth policy. Destroy as much as he can before he shoved into the abyss again, chained by Michael I do believe that Malachi Martin started to believe his own lies. He was so convincing. Some people didn't exactly hate him. They felt sorry for him. Because he had gone off the rail. I geuss the charisma was truth. Because that's really... what he That was his message.
