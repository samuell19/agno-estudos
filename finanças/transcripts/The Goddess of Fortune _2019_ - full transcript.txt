THE GODDESS OF FORTUNE Mom! Lorenzo's not breathing, he's suffocating! Open up, please, he's suffering. Mom! I can't take it anymore! Let us out, open up! Please, mom, Lorenzo's suffocating! Mom! Mom! Mom, let us out! Open up! Lorenzo's not well! I'll smash that phone, stop it! And we're not even married... Even better. - When's the wedding? - Soon, in Rome. Limo and all! Where are the grooms? Hi, Prissi. Here they are! How's it going? Arturo, enough with that fucking phone! Where's Alessandro? I've been looking for him. So have I. Hi, ladies! I want to thank you and Alessandro for being so amazing. Right on, mom. If they hadn't lent us the house, we would've been doomed. Cheers! Joint property? What's up? I'm drinking and talking. Mina and Esra are the capital's best wedding planners. - Rings? - No. You don't want your favorite song played during the ceremony? That's what I like to hear! You'd better delete this. - What's that? - A wedding gift. - Giant salami. - To be sliced. One slice at a time, it's spicy! - The soon-to-be grooms! - We're first. Folks, group photo! - Group photo! - Gather around. - Where? - Say cheese. Say cheese. It was a video, not a photo. Kiss! Kiss! Congrats! Ginevra? This is Filippo. - Haven't we met before? - Have you met before? We're married, my love. He wanted to see the walk-in closet, they're remodeling. Emanuele, Arturo. Emanuele, your future husband is looking for you. Drink. What can I say? This cake is as luscious as I am! Whenever I'm here, I feel like I'm at home... at my own home, where I serve everyone. - Quit moping. - Know when we last fucked? You two? The Middle Ages. In long-term relationships, passion fades away. - What do you know? - I have a long-term relationship... And it's very satisfying. No letdowns, incredible sex. - With whom? - Myself! Hi, is Alessandro here? Here, thanks. Hold on. Thanks. Sweetie! Hi, baby. Finally! It took a while, the car broke down, then we took the bus... - I'm chronically late. - I know. Uncle's darlings, how are you? Hungry? That's Annamaria. Marco and Claudio, we're celebrating their wedding. Welcome. You know Filippo. Arturo, look who's here! No way! What a surprise! - How are you? - Fine. Hello. Kids, you've grown so much! You've never met them before. Not him, but I saw her when she was this small. Like a dog? Martina! She's been a bit sassy. Mom! - Why are you hiding? - I'm not hiding, ma'am. It's a pleasure to meet you. - Likewise. - He's not sassy. - He's formal with everyone. - I love him already. He seems shy but then... - He's Alessandro. - I call him Sandro even if he hates it. There's another Alessandro here. Yes, there is... She's the legendary Annamaria, I'm sure you know the story. - She introduced me to Arturo. - She did? We don't want to know the details. I introduced them like 15 years ago. 15 and a half. They haven't sued me yet. - You should've told me. - I did. - No. - I did. - Any food for them? - What would you like? Whatever you want, we have it. - How are you? - Fine, and you? Take my advice, never wear stilettos. They elongate, tone the glutes, and give you poise, but once you put them on, they'll destroy you! - Your feet? - No, your soul. They're like drugs. I've always fallen for the wrong man too. But maybe it's thanks to them that I found Filippo. How nice. I'm Filippo, who are you? I'm still Alessandro, sir. - But at the end of the day... - Her son. I have two kids... several men who ran away like the wind... - Who is she? - Annamaria, my mother. Maybe it was best, because they're truly mine in every sense. Who needs a father? Wow... she's beautiful. A knight in shining armor rusts. - What's wrong? - What's wrong... - What's wrong? - You should've told me. - I did. - You didn't. I did or I just forgot to. Hey, what about these? Guys... Sorry, it's not about you... I'm sorry. You know I'm thrilled you're here. How long are you here for? The kids will stay for three days. Why, where are you going? To the hospital, for some tests and exams. - Nothing major. - Meaning? It's no big deal, I've been having migraines... They come and go and are really painful, so... I'm so glad the kids are staying here. I don't trust anyone in Palestrina. You mean nobody trusts you in Palestrina! Did you have fun? - When? - You know when. Right, kind of. - You seemed cheery. - Are you jealous? - Me? Nonsense. - Envious maybe? Of what? Listen, I didn't do anything wrong. You've done it, I've done it, we've had threesomes. Even foursomes, but not often. Not often? I'm not sure, but I'd say at least five times. It's the way you did it, in front of everyone in our home. You don't care about anyone else, so long as you're happy. Oh God, what a nag! What's the big deal? I don't even like him. Give me a break! I've missed you both. We didn't. But sleep now. Don't start. Sweet and savory for breakfast? - You call this savory? - It is. I didn't put salt on it, you did. Do you know how to shower on your own? Of course. Can he brush his teeth? Obviously. They know how to brush their teeth and shower. They could scrub us all clean. Ready? All set. - Keep an eye on these two, okay? - Of course. I was talking to them. - Bye. - Bye. - Good morning. - Morning. Hello! - How are you? - Fine, and you, ma'am? Well, thanks. Hold on a second... You never talk to me... It arrives on Friday we'll email the invoice. Right, Prissi? - Okay. - By noon, please. - Yes, thanks. - Bye. - Well? - We're doing some shopping. - Can you watch them for an hour? - Of course. No, honey, I have to teach Prissi how to send e-invoices, it's a busy day. You're always teaching! - I'm studying to open my own store. - Tough competition. Let's barter though: I'll keep them for an hour, you take him for two. Never mind, thanks. - Bye... Filippo! - Bye. Filippo, she was joking. - Filippo? - Thanks, bye. We'd like a three-tier cake but I don't like this one. Is it possible to have a cake made by a famous chef? Sure. I already said yes to the limo... I actually wanted a Rolls Royce! Excuse me. - Can you finish up? - Sure. Hi! - How are you? - Hi, Mina! Coffee, please, no milk. This is my kingdom, order anything you want. Everything is super fresh: pizza, ice cream, juice. - What should we get? - Whatever you want. - A slice of cake? - No, thanks. - So you got stuck with them? - No surprise! Could you watch them for an hour at most? This isn't child services, we're busy here. We decided on the striped ones. No, you fool, the white ones. - No lilies then? - And dark chocolate, thanks. Want a slice of cake? - Hold on. - What are you doing? You know... putting on lipstick relaxes me. It's normal to be nervous, I am too. - Want some lipstick? - Sure! Go ahead. Silly. - So what's going on? - I'll tell you in three days. I think you're dolling up for the doctor. He's no big deal... We make no exceptions here, don't start talking to me about urgency and emergencies... it's useless, the only emergencies are ours. Those are the visiting hours, only family can come after. - You're the husband? - No. Boyfriend? - Just a friend? - Just a friend. Fine, we'll make an exception for cute, funny guys. Morning! Your triple is now a quadruple. - Hello. - Go ahead. Hello, I'm Annamaria, I'm your new roommate. If you play Rummy, we'll have fun. Rummy? At most they play Go Fish. Having fun here is a lost cause. Are you a fireman? Fireman? - No, why? - No reason... I can picture you in a uniform. I'm a plumber, and I don't wear a uniform. You can't really tell, but she's a Baroness. - Gee, thanks. - No need to be ashamed. I'm related to a Baroness. The Baroness here will turn this room into a palace. Hey, "just a friend", time to go. - Come say bye to us, too. - Knock it off. Let's go. Call you later. The little guy is gone, and we lost Joy, too. We lost the diamond, we lost Joy, we lost it all. Kids... Kids! Time to go to bed. Blame it on the stream. Kids, I'm talking to you, it's time for bed! Are you listening to me? It's time for bed! - They're awake? - They don't listen. Shut that thing off. Pee, pajamas, and brush your teeth. Get going now! Can we check the room for spiders first? - Spiders? - Mom found one yesterday. I hate spiders. Let's go check for spiders then. - Arturo, come with us. - No, I have to work. - It was under the bed. - Odd, Arturo cleans everything. Got it! Not on my bed! No, this is the famous "belly rub" spider! There's another "belly rub" spider! Stop! Let's see... - It's time to sleep now. - Easier said than done. - Should I tell you a story? - Give it a try. - A fairytale? - Oh please, we're not 5 years old. Well then? Well... What's wrong with mom? They don't know. That's why she's going in for tests. I have an idea... Why don't you tell me a nice story? About? Dunno... the greatest thing that happened to you. Seeing dolphins at the aquarium last year. He's obsessed with those dolphins. - Dolphins are amazing. - Yeah, whatever. Come on. Come on. - Do you understand Bantu? - Why would I? I'm from Rome! Why on earth do we come here every year in the summer... to sweat to death and get eaten alive by these insects? You don't have to come, it's not like Mardi Gras. Thanks for that, Miss Sincerity and Authenticity. You think you're Mina but all you are is an imitation, a poor imitation, of Grace Kelly. Look! The Goddess of Fortune has a secret. What goddess? At the museum where Annamaria works. A magic trick, how do you keep someone you love with you forever? Who knows? It's easy: you have to stare at them, like this. You steal their image, close your eyes tight and keep them closed, till the image reaches your heart. From then on, the person will be with you forever. Nice. You know, these hills are killing... my knee. Esra, I've told you before, you need to lose weight. My knee hurts, not my belly! I don't know why I bother talking to you. Annamaria? Hi. Fine, we're heading back now. The kids are fine. What time should I pick you up tomorrow? Why? You need to tell the kids this. I can't... All right. Fine, talk to you later. They want to keep her in the hospital for a few more days. Darn it. 5 tops, 15 bottoms, and 10 versatile. 30 in this area, maybe some are on their death bed! One is just meters away. Wonder if it's the guy who's sitting or standing. - Is that all you think about? - To distract me. I can't believe it! - She taught it to you? - Yes, to help them sleep. Esra told me it was your lullaby. It works well. She always loved Mina, my father wanted a son... Your mom wanted a daughter to call Mina. And here I am, in the flesh. - Know any other Mina songs? - All of them. Are they driving you nuts already? No, they're great. How are things going with your uncles? They're not our uncles. - One is cool. - The other one. Aren't you funny? I'll sing Mina to you tonight. So, what did you want to tell me? What did the doctors say? Dunno, I think they're waiting for new equipment. - All bullshit. - Bullshit? Like what? Are you annoyed the kids are staying a few more days? - Is that what you think? -There are worse things in life. Don't you realize I'm worried about you? So you want me to worry about the fact that you're worried? Annamaria! Annamaria, come back here, please. - Lower your voice. - Sorry. Visiting hours are over, you can't just do as you please. Yes, but I wanted to know... Can you tell me what they're looking for? - What are the doctors looking for? - The usual things. They need to figure out if, how, and when to operate. - Operate what? - You're asking me? Eat your veggies. Organic zucchini and potatoes, and free-range chicken. Go wash your hands. We already did. - Hello. - Hi. - Is it ready? I only have 30 minutes. - Don't leave your bags there. You didn't know about the operation? - If I did, I would've told you. - Right. Like you told me the kids were staying here. You finally admitted it! The kids are the problem. - No. - They bother you? The problem is you never fucking talk. All this fuss for an extra mouth? You're turning this around on me as usual! - It's not the kids, it's you. - Don't yell. - I'm not yelling. - You're shouting. - It's your fault they're kicking us out. - Why? Because you're a zombie, you never talk or show emotion. - Look at you... - Leave me alone. Or else? I bust my ass all day, I come home to rest for a few minutes and you're pouting... what the fuck do you want? - It's your fault mom's sick. - Liar. I want to know what Annamaria told you that you're not telling me. It's your fault she's in the hospital. I know what you know, I'm worried about Annamaria, not you. I'm not worried about us. - I can't stand it when you do this. - I hate you. I'll kill you. Idiot, what's wrong with your brain? Hey, stop it! - He started it. - She started it. Calm down. He wet me, he's such an idiot! Enough, calm down. Calm down. Let's eat now, okay? Yes. Let's eat. Arturo made a delicious chicken. Sit here. It's hot. - Fresh orange juice. - Thank you, ma'am. - Would you like some? - No, thanks. Your son is so polite. He's not my son. He's my new assistant. Sandro, the monkey wrench. - Which one? - The smaller one. Come here. No, open the water. Put your hand here and squeeze this tube. Feel that? Feel it running? This is like a vein that leads to an artery. - Do you study anatomy? - Yes. Plumbing is like the human body. Understand? It's alive, it breathes. Put your hand on this other tube. Nothing is flowing here. This is the artery that leads to the heart. If nothing is flowing, what does that mean? It's clogged. And so now... we have to unclog it. While I'm working on this big valve here, you have to hold the smaller valve as tight as you possibly can. - What if I can't do it? - The sink will have a heart attack. But I'm sure you can do it. - Tight, with both hands. - What if I break it? If you break it, who cares, I'll fix everything. But don't ever be afraid to do things. Okay? Use all of your muscles. You can do it! Give it your all. Okay, it's unscrewed now. Good. See, you did it. - Are we all done? - No, you have to clean up. What are you doing? I was kidding. You did a great job. Now shut off the water and go drink your juice. - What's wrong? - Nothing. - What are you doing? - Translating. What? - An 18th century English philosopher. - What a drag. Martina, will you please let me work? Play with your iPad, or go on the terrace, it's nice out. All right. Well? Why did my mom name my brother after Alessandro? I don't know. They're great friends, they love each other. "Love" in what way? Martina, what's up? They look alike. - Who? - Him and my brother. Alessandro and mom are old friends. You know that. So? They used to sleep together. She told me. - Like siblings though. - Oh please, you fell for that? All three of us slept together, actually. You lived in Palestrina for a long time? Ages ago when I was an employee. But you went back after, too. Annamaria had me redo the bathrooms at the Goddess of Fortune museum. Why? How many years ago? 8, 9... Arturo, quit beating around the bush, what's the question? Today Martina pointed out that Sandro looks like you. Sandro? Is that funny? No way. Martina thinks Sandro's your son. Damn, Martina sure is clever. Such a smart girl. She can tell when there's love and passion between two people. Yes or no? It's not really a migraine, more like strong pressure around my head. The good news is, it's probably not a tumor. They'll do a biopsy but it's nothing major... - It's not an aneurysm. - Good. The arteries are bunched up, it's congenital. They said since I was born like this, it's technically less dangerous. A brain operation is never a walk in the park. - What do you know? They're deciding. - They've decided. Why are you talking about these technical things? I just want them to hurry up so I can get out. One thing I'm annoyed about is they had said they were going to use a probe. - But...? - They're opening me up. Opening your head? It'll be fine, relax. No need to worry. It wasn't an excuse to just dump my kids on you. Don't worry about the kids, they're fine without you. Since Alessandro looks after them they're fine. Jealous? Thanks. Jesus, her roommate is a pain. She's not a doctor but insists on talking... Luckily it's not a tumor or an aneurysm, that's good. Recovery will be slow but you and I can organize and find a way to watch the kids. It's Annamaria, Arturo. Not just anyone. - I know. - No, you don't. You don't know. You've never understood how much she means to me. She and I were kind of together when she introduced us. Then... she caught on to me and you, and she just backed away. I took it for granted. And she never guilt-tripped me. During all these years I should've helped her, with the kids, with her chaotic life... But I was incapable. That's just what I am. Incapable. But you're capable of fastening a helmet. Dummy. Divide the dividend by the divisor. I know, but I need the quotient. The quotient? The quotient... Ancus Marcius. - Tullus Hostilius... - No, start over. - Why? - Start over. Romulus, Numa Pompilius... - We'll figure out the quotient. - Hold on... Is this right? Divide... Seven to the power of four, equals seven to the power of eight? Let me answer this message first. Romulus, Numa Pompilius, Tullus Hostilius... - Ancus Marcius. - You already said that. - When? - Before. - I did? - Yes. Divided by seven to the power of two... the dividend is... - I studied humanities! - Pay attention. - Come on. - I am paying attention. Divided by seven to the power of two. So the dividend is... Tarquinius Priscus! Like Bashful, I always forget him. 49. Right? You got 49, too? Good job. 49, indeed. Romulus, Numa Pompilius, Tullus Hostilius... - Hurry up, I'm hungry. - Don't interrupt me, I'm almost done. Let them finish, I'll make dinner. - Ancus whatshisname. - Ancus Marcius. Ancus whatshisname! Tarquinius Priscus... I don't know. I don't know them! Aren't you hungry? - Yes or no? - Yes. Then let's eat. Are you sad? No, why do you say that? I'm sorry, ma'am. Was I wrong? You're not wrong, I am sad, it's true. Why did I say no? Silly me. You're not a child. I'm the one who's sorry. I'm sorry. Why? It's nice being with a woman like you. Are you sad? How could I be? You fall in love with me again every day. It's so nice. Dinner's here! Pizza! - Oh God! - No, we're eating in here. Prissi? Come over! Esra? Mina? - Prissi, come while it's hot. - Esra? Mina? - Coming. - Hurry. It's hot, careful! - What kind? - All kinds! Mozzarella and sauce. Sausage. Dinosaur slices. What is it, Arturo? I'm working. Who are you? How is he now? Send me the location, I'll be right there. - All done? - No, I have an emergency. - What'll I tell madam? - I'll be back tomorrow. - Alessandro? - Yes. - I'm Michele. - Hello. He suddenly felt ill and became pale, I got worried. I wanted to call 911, but he insisted I call you. - How is he? - I gave him a tranquilizer. We need to wake him up, I'm in a rush. - Let me explain... - No need, I already know. He told you? Relax, it's normal after all these years. I've done it, too. You have another boyfriend, too? Hey, buddy... you just fucked him, you're not his boyfriend. After two years together am I his boyfriend? What... two years? He's been promising me forever that he'd tell you. At first, we just fucked now and then but... You never noticed? You're distracted. Noticed what? He's always home, he never goes out. You're always out. Yes, but... You did that at our house! - Hush, you'll wake him.' - Good! Because I can't carry him home. - You did it at our house?! - Never, I swear. He comes over here when you're busy. - It's not easy for me either. - Cry me a river! I believed him when he said he'd tell you. - What? - That he was leaving you for me. For you? When? But he kept putting it off. I should've known better. As soon as he took ill he wanted you. Nobody but you, he kept telling me to call Alessandro. It's as clear as day: you're the one he loves. So? Do you expect sympathy from me? Do me a favor, tell him I can't carry on like this, it's over, I don't want to see him again. Thanks. Close the door when you leave. Am I the love messenger now? Wake up, dummy. Come on, move it. Oh God. Get dressed. Pass me my pants, please. You might want to put your underwear on first. Dumbass. Two years? Wow, impressive. - You've been doing it for longer. - They were just flings. It has to be a relationship for you, you're a hypocrite even in sex. You picked him up online and fell in love. - I didn't pick him up online. - No? Where then? In an art gallery, at a vernissage. Scared? So he trolls museums? - It was his exhibit. - I saw his masterpiece. Nice pose, impressive. You've jerked me around for two years. I would've told you. When? - As you walked out the door? - I wasn't leaving. That's not what I heard. Unpack your bags, I doubt he'll be taking you back. Actually, he won't. - What did you say to him? - Me? Don't worry... I didn't ruin your game, you did it all on your own. He realized how much you love me. Imagine, he's jealous of me now! Wonder what you led him to believe. I'm dying to know how you bamboozled him. I can picture you. I can picture you. You know, after many years together... we stopped having sex and we're both free to do as we please. We're... we're like brothers. No, brothers is too much, you probably said... You must've said: "There's a great affinity but... we're like friends, more than friends, we're... like..." Like what? What are we, Arturo? Give it a name, let's see what you come up with. My goodness, you've found your tongue at last. You haven't talked to me like this in ages. Betrayal does you good. Go ahead, do it. You're a child. Martina? Sandro? - You left them alone? - No. - You left them alone? - Yes, I left them alone. Are you crazy? Martina? - Sandro! - Martina! Sandro! - Check the terrace. - Sandro? Esra, Mina, are you home? How can you leave two kids alone at home? Kids? Prissi? Prissi? Where is everybody? - What were you thinking? - I was coming right back. You had one job, since you do shit all day. - What did you say? - Never mind. Sandro? Martina? - Did you see the kids? - What kids? - Sandro, Martina. - Who? - Forget it. - What's wrong? - This dummy forgot them. - I was coming right back. Sandro? - Marzia, did you see the kids? - No, why? You lost them? - No, they must've gone out... - He lost them! "I, Annamaria Muscara', born in Palermo on July 10, 1981, resident in Via della Stella 12, Palestrina..." Nadia, did you see a 10 and 12-year-old out on their own? No. "Being of sound mind and body, I appoint, in the event of my death, or if I lose possession of my faculties due to an accident or serious illness, Alessandro Marchetti..." Did you see two kids? Yes, at the supermarket 10 minutes ago. At the supermarket, Arturo! They're at the supermarket. "Born in Rome on January 27, 1977... resident in Via della Lega Lombarda 43, Rome... Regardless of his marital status, to be the legal guardian as per article 348 of the civil code... of my daughter, Martina Muscara', born in Rome on February 15, 2007, and my son, Alessandro Muscara', born in Rome on November 21, 2011..." For Christ's sake! For Christ's sake! Who said you could go out? Who? - Are you insane? - You scared us to death. - You can't just run off. - You can't! I don't want to hear a word, let's go home. "Due to the fact that their biological fathers didn't acknowledge them, Alessandro Marchetti was the person most present in the upbringing and education of my children, and more than any relative or friend, he established a relationship of trust and affection with them. You're a bunch of assholes, you all knew! - I swear we didn't know. - You definitely knew. Why would we know? Arturo isn't one to talk. - What did Arturo do? - He's having an affair, I suspected it. Prissi... We all have affairs, not just Arturo. Who's Arturo? So Prissi knew, but you didn't? Mina knew nothing? You know everybody's business but you didn't know about this? You hadn't noticed. Reflect on why it happened. I have to reflect? He would sneak out while I was working, you were all blind, but I'm the whore and he's the saint? Stop talking about me as if I weren't here! And quit swearing in front of the kids. Worried about the kids now? First you forget them, and now your guilt caught up with you. - Come with me, please. - No. - I want to talk. - No. - Come with me, please. - Say it in front of everyone. Are you embarrassed? Enough. Enough. Let's put an end to this. I'm fed up. I have been for a while. I'm going to leave now... I'll come back for my stuff tomorrow. Mom! - Mommy! - Hello. I opened the door and there she was. A nurse helped me out. - What a pretty dress. - I came back just for you. I'll stay late, then Mina will drive me back. I wanted to talk to you about the kids. - I wrote a letter. - Arturo and I are splitting up. Why? He has another man. And it's not a fling. You don't split up after all these years for a silly betrayal. - You split up for much less. - What do I have to do with it? I'm impulsive, I'm not made to be in a couple. You two are Siamese twins, you can't split. Well, the time has come for us to split. And we have to do it alone. I can't keep the kids anymore. I can't watch them alone. Are you bailing out on me just before my operation? Well... this isn't the right environment, it's a nuthouse. I took Sandro to work with me, but it was in a home. I work at construction sites. Two kids... you understand that's a huge responsibility? I can't do it anymore. So? There is a solution... What? You know. No, no... - Not her. - Not for long, just till you're better. I said no. - Enough! - Come here. Come here. Are you afraid? What are you doing? Sleeping here. Sleep in the bedroom as long as the kids are here. - They saw us fighting. - So what? Fighting is one thing, sleeping on the sofa... is another. We did the biopsy. Make sure you don't tire her out. Hush. Hello. That bandage suits you. All right. Try... Try to call her. I'm sure she won't come. She won't want them underfoot. Keep me out of it. Don't beg her. Don't insist. She's a witch. You two are worse witches than her though... I'll get you back for this. Hello, is this Mrs. Elena? Who is this? Hello, I'm Alessandro Marchetti, a friend of Annamaria, your daughter. - Did something happen to her? - Yes, no, I mean don't worry. Nothing serious, but... Annamaria needs an operation, she's in the hospital, but she's fine... - What operation? - Well, ma'am... it's a rather delicate operation on her brain. But it's not what you think, it's congenital... I don't really know much more, but the point is... Annamaria's recovery will take quite a while. God, that's awful. Yes, the point is she needs... someone to look after the kids. That's why I'm calling, your grandkids are with us. - Us, who? - Me and Arturo. Hello, ma'am, I'm Arturo. You see... the kids are with us now but they live in Palestrina, near Rome, and they obviously can't be alone, so perhaps... you could come and look after them? I'm sorry, but I'm in no condition to travel. My leg is aching. But... can't the children come stay with me? I might not have been a good mother, but I could be a good grandmother. Give me her number, I'll call her. All right, I'll tell Annamaria and have her call you back. Thank you, and don't worry. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, talk to you soon. Goodbye, thanks. Weren't we supposed to call that lady? Later, my love. Yes, mom, I love you a bunch too. Sandro, what are you doing? Talking to yourself now? Sandro? Come on, let's go. The Goddess of Fortune heals all illnesses. It's true, ancient peoples believed she had palliative powers. You used bigger words to say what Sandro just said, Mr. Know-it-all. - Not my fault you're ignorant. - I was ignorant before, too. - Pity I didn't notice. - I didn't notice a lot of things. But luckily, there's still time. What's wrong? What are you looking at? I was here. With a group of tourists. I was a tour guide. I was explaining that... for Romans, fortune was just chance that manifests as neutral... And we're the ones who make it good or bad. Alessandro and your mom were sitting there. No, I wasn't sitting. You're right. Annamaria was sitting. You were standing with your back to me. When she waved to me, you turned and looked at me. Love at first sight? For me, yes. But I was too boorish for milord. That's why he liked me, because I'm the opposite of him. You still remember this? Mom... we'll be fine. It'll be fun to see the place where you grew up. I heard there's a huge yard, the house is huge, and it's near the beach. Sweetie... Everyone behave, okay? Don't upset grandma, make sure to obey her... always agree with her. Trust me. - All right. - Control yourself. Don't worry, mom, I'll keep an eye on her. So... all's well that ends well, right? This way you two can sort your things out. - Want some ice cream? - Yes. Can we go get ice cream? - Do you have money? - Yes, I have some left. All right, but don't wander off too far. - Martina, look after your brother. - Okay. Pass the ketchup. Listen, Arturo... I want to end things cordially. Without hurting each other. You've been mute since we left. I didn't ask you to come, I could've gone with them alone. Right. Because they're more yours than mine, right? Like everything else. Like Annamaria, our friends, our house, obviously. It's your house, so I'll leave. You love playing victim. I bet you're going to start talking about your academic career again the things you turned down... go ahead. I made choices, wrong choices, but I made them. So you chose not to be a writer. I recall when you got that letter from the publisher who rejected your works, you cried for three days. Should I mention the teaching post? In order to turn down a post, you have to take a test and pass, then you can turn it down, but you never made it that far. Did I stop you? I gave it all up to come to Rome. No, you gave up a shitty life compared to the one I granted you. Shall we get down to the bottom line? How much money did you earn with those fucking translations? Don't play misunderstood artist with me, Arturo. It's not my fault you're a loser. What are you doing? Pass me the ketchup, loser. What are you doing here so late? He woke me up, I was sound asleep. - Why? - He was worried when he didn't see you. Really? I could have been a university professor, you know? I could've been teaching... But I gave it all up. Yes, I made that choice, I know it was my choice. So long ago. But it went by... in a flash. Then what the fuck happened? When did it all change? Nobody warns you. Nobody says: "Hey, beware of the danger!" No more sex, no more passion, no more romanticism. Nothing. That can happen though... But we had plans nonetheless, you know? Now I can't even remember what the fucking plan was! What else can we do together, wait till we grow old? At times, I look at him... and he seems like a stranger. But he still warms my heart when... he pulls his dumb stunts. Tons of them! Because I know him inside and out. I know who he is. I don't know if that's enough. I don't think it's enough. We won't grow old together anymore. You're already old. Wait for me. Good morning. Good morning. Welcome, I'm Lea. Follow me. That's not grandma. - Hello, welcome. - I'm Alessandro. - Alessandro, I'm Elena. - Arturo. These are my grandchildren. I'm your grandmother, did you know that? You're Sandro... And you're Martina. What a pretty face. And what proud eyes. Come in, please. You can leave your bags here. I'm so grateful you brought my grandchildren here. You can't even imagine how long I've waited for this moment. Our pleasure, your daughter told us a lot about you. I'm afraid to ask what. Some refreshments. What did you make, Lea? Three types of granita for the kids. Almond milk, lemonade, iced tea, and cannoli. Once you settle in, you can eat. Kids, come here, this is your room. Like it? You will never get bored here. Right, Lea? You can go for boat rides, swims, anything you want. - I hope you can swim! - Are there dolphins? No, thank God. Madam had me prepare two rooms for you with a shared bathroom. It's a temporary set-up. - You're only here for the night? - Yes. This was Annamaria's room. One day she tried to set her room on fire. I had to change all of the upholstery. - He'll take this room. - No, you can have it. You take it... please. Fine, I will. - Have you settled it? - Yes. You're Arturo, right? Come this way with me. This was Lorenzo's room. My son. He died on this bed. Nobody has slept on it since then. You're the first. Thanks. I met Baron Muscara' in Todi. He was a friend of family friends. The only good thing he left me with was Lea. My family has attended to Barons for generations. I couldn't have survived without her, we've been through thick and thin, she's like a sister, even better! Such an exaggeration, Madam. Madam's exaggerating. She and I are the only ones left here. My daughter used to be here but she ran away. Then my son also left too soon. Many years ago, it was a tragedy. An overdose. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have. No need to apologize. Lea introduced me to Melina and Leonardo. They organize everything. If Madam didn't rent out the side wings of this house... it would all go to rack and ruin. You should see the parties they organize! We don't hear a peep from here. Nobody bothers us. Nobody will see you. But you'll have so much fun. The children will be a nice distraction for you. Madam doesn't need distractions. Sorry, I was just saying... You'll have a great time. How long will my grandchildren stay here for? It depends on Annamaria's recovery. She'll recover quickly in order not to leave them with me! - Hope so. - Martina! Eat. - I'll give it back tomorrow. - Okay. - Need anything else? - No. Okay, go back to bed and don't wake Sandro up. - Sure you want to sleep here? - Yes, why not? - You don't want to sleep together? - Let's go, it's late. - Fine, goodnight. - Night. Leave it open. Give my daughter my regards and tell her it would be nice to see her after all these years. I'd like to thank you... for bringing two new lives into this home. Thank you for the hospitality. Give my regards to Annamaria, please. Of course. We're off. Behave. - Go to the beach, it's amazing. - Easy on the ice cream. Okay? - We'll come back for you soon. - I doubt it. - Why? - We'll be back, I promised. Sandro! Wait, come here. Sandro! Leave him be, our family tends to be emotional, but I'll make sure he learns self-control. Come here, Martina. Goodbye. Sandro, what did you do? Maybe it was an act, but she was nice to them, really. If you say so. When it's all over, I'll go fetch them right away, promise. And you two? - How are you? - Fine. I found a room for rent. I'll move soon. Don't worry, the two of us will still look after you. Good morning. - Good morning. - No need, I'll be quick. They're close friends. - How are you? - Aside from my headache, fine. Are we ready? Early tomorrow morning. Just broth for dinner. We'll go cut your hair soon. Don't shave it, please. We have to. After the operation, any oddities will be normal. Oddities are normal for her, so... She might repeat the same phrases, or not talk for days. So be prepared. - Don't tire her out. - All right. - See you later. - Bye. Can we talk about that doctor?! I was waiting for your comment...want an operation, too? More like a thorough exam... I did it for you, to spare you, otherwise you'd be struck... - Struck by you know what. - "No big deal", my foot! Holy big deal! I have a feeling he's faking it. For sure. Isn't everyone? Annamaria? Doctor! - Doctor! Nurse! - Sit up. - What's wrong? - Dunno. - Help! - Move. Annamaria? Annamaria! CAT scan! - Enrico! - Hurry. Quick! Hurry up! - Annamaria? - Come on. Let's go. Turn... Thanks. Thanks. - Thanks. - Poor Annamaria. Thanks. - Condolences. - Thanks. - What a shame, what anguish. - Thank you. A shattered home. - The kids aren't in their room. - No? No. Still here? Why? We want to say bye to the kids, where are they? My grandchildren are distraught and saying bye to you would further upset them. Ma'am, Annamaria wanted to be cremated, you knew that. No one in my family has been cremated, I won't make an exception for her. Those were her wishes. Annamaria always did as she pleased and always went astray. But her illness made her see some sense, and she sent the kids to me. Actually, we forced her to. She didn't want to. We have issues to work out, otherwise... Otherwise? - We would've kept them. - Yes. - Our friends would've helped. - Your friends? I know your friends. You mean that refugee and her plastic filled son-daughter or Lord knows what!? Or that toilet bowl saleslady with the brainless husband? Or the Negro? These friends? You wanted them to help raise my grandchildren? How do you know all this? I've always known everything about Annamaria. Because she was my daughter, my blood. You spied on her? You two really thought you could raise my grandchildren? And you two are even... What? Just say it! Lea! Lea! - See these men out. - No need. We know the way. Don't worry, soon enough the children will forget... Their mother? Impossible. Not their mother, you two! This way, come this way. This was Annamaria's, I saved it. Madam wouldn't let me put it in her coffin. May I give it to you, as a memento? You loved her, and so did I. First her brother... then my little girl. It's not fair. When they were kids, I was so young... How could I help them? At night I still hear... I still hear... them banging on the closet door. I hear them crying. Elena... Madam Elena... was my everything. More than my own family. How could she change now? She can't. I had hoped that... at least you... But you have your troubles, I understand. You were born troubled. May God forgive me... I don't want Madam Elena to relapse again. Meaning? Relapse again, meaning what? - You mean with Sandro and Martina? - Hush, for God's sake! I didn't say anything. I didn't think anything. I was talking about before, many years ago. Now go. Go on. May the Lord guide you. Did you hear her? That we have troubles. Let's get some more trouble. - Stop! - Where are the kids? Out! They're where they need to be. - I'll call the Police. - Sandro! - Martina! - Give me the phone, bitch! Perverts! Stop! Lea! Bastards! Lea! - Martina! - Sandro! - How dare you come in? - What's going on? - Stop! - I'll have you arrested. - Stop! - Give me the key. Give me the fucking key! Give me the key. And shut up! Here. Enough! I'll ruin you. You don't know who I am, but you will! So it's true? That's where you locked up Annamaria! It's true! Yes, and she deserved it. Get inside! You're a monster! - Witch! - Monster! You'll be arrested! Arrested! Be thankful I'm not locking you in this fucking closet forever, bitch! Hear me? Bitch! Perverted fags! This is called kidnapping, you'll rot in jail for this. We missed the boat. You said we had to go to Messina to get on the ferry. Messina's three hours away. Four, if you drive. Now what? We'll figure it out tomorrow. And if they arrest you? We'll figure it out tomorrow. Tomorrow you'll tell me why you're staring. - A dolphin! - Really? - Really? - Look! Sandro! Hold on. Sandro, wait. Sandro, stop. Kids, do you know the Goddess of Fortune has a secret? It's a magic trick. How do you keep someone you love with you forever? You have to stare at them... steal their image... close your eyes tight. And keep them closed. Till the image reaches your heart. From then on, the person... will be with you forever. Forever. Forever.
