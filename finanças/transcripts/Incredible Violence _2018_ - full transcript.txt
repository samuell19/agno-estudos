¶¶¶¶ [Foreboding music] Man: I was up a couple of weeks ago and the whole area was flooded. Couldn't even get in past the gate. You gotta be careful of the weather up this way. Yeah. About a week ago, just north of here? Snow. Everything covered for four days. And then it flooded down here. So, like that, we'd have to bring the truck in. But I'm not supposed to be doing that on my own. Walking like this, these conditions? No problem. But, if I get stuck in here, now with the truck or the ATV? Maybe get hurt or something, you know? I'm in shit with the daughter. Make sure, now, everybody got the right clothing. 'Cause, you know, you'd catch your death up here. Yeah. Well, I don't think I'll be that lucky. What are you calling it, again? Incredible Violence. Well, there it is. Full basement and three stories. If we don't sell it out from under you- It's yours to use. Looks good. And no one is around? Take a look. You can scream blue murder out here. There's not a neighbour around to hear you. Sounds good. How about inside? [Bang} Ooof! She's stuck. [Bang, bang] After the flood, she's all swollen. So, is this happening, or... Between the doors and the windows, now. I think you need a crowbar... and a crooked woman just to get into this house. [Bang, bang] Come on we go see what's in the shed. [From the shed] The daughter's gonna be so excited when she hears you're making a horror movie in her childhood home. She's a real fan of that stuff. I guess you'll recognize the house when it comes out in the movie? What are you calling it again? Invisible Violence. I'll have to write that down now, so I remember when it comes out. Who knows, you might even come up with a better name for it by then. Are you looking for a couple of dead people? Myself and the daughter would love to be a part of it. Just to see how you make it all happen. [Whispering] I am a vessel. - She'd be really pleased if you could accommodate her. - I'm not saying you got to. - I am the vessel - You can still have the house. I'm not the sort of fella who'd give something, expecting something in return, you know. Now where did I put that thing again, now? ¶¶¶¶ [Electronic music] There it is! Alright. [Phone buzzes] [Glass tips over] [Phone buzzes] I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. Man: How much was it for? They gave me two hundred and fifty k. - [Whistles] How much is left? What did you spend it on? - I don't know. It went here and there. - You spend a quarter of a million dollars here and there? - It was sitting in my bank account for months. I was supposed to make the movie months ago. I just put it off and I put it off and I put it off. Anyway... It's gone now. That's that. - So what's gonna happen to you? - I think it's fraud. Isn't it? - Yeah, Patrick. It's major league fucking fraud. Who lent you the money? - I'm not real sure. - You're not that sure. - It's like... a group of investors. You know, like... Like a group. An organization. - Like a legal organization? Are you serious? - Now that you mention it. It was all very creepy. - You're gonna die, man. These people are gonna kill you. - Makes sense. I thought they'd do. - Can you get people to work on it for free? - Actors, yes, absolutely. Those people would do anything for free. Crew, though? For a horror movie, you need stunts, makeup. Special effects. Lights and sound, camera. Wardrobe, makeup. Free is not a realistic option. [Sighs] This is awful. Do you know, I was gonna be a lawyer? I decided last year. I was gonna write the exam. Gonna be lawyer. But I got that money. I should have turned it down. ¶¶¶¶ [Foreboding electronic music] [Bed clunks up the stairs] [Crunching chips] [Tapping keyboard] [Printing] Man: You should do what that guy in the mid South did. - Did he go to law school? 'Cause that's what I shoulda done. - No. No, he put an ad... or like a notice online. And was calling for actors for his slasher film. So this amateur actor guy answers the call. And the dude says, come on over. We're shooting in my basement. And this poor amateur dude has never acted before. So, he doesn't think that's weird. So, he goes on over. And of course, the director looks normal. Oh, and before that, the director - He sends the actor guy some footage, or stuff to look at. And it looks legit. So, he goes on over. And of course, the director is completely off his tits. Psycho. And the guy, the actor guy, he doesn't know what hit him Until he's tied to a chair. And the director is slicing him up. Musta looked real, though. Because it was real. - I don't like actors. Vile human beings. Selfish. What happened to the guy? - Oh man. The police found him almost immediately. I'm pretty sure they killed him. - Good advice. - Well, pin it on somebody else. I dunno. Where's your idea? [Phone buzzes] It's been every five minutes for days now. I'm dead. - So what's wrong with my idea then? - What's wrong with your idea? - Oh, does it go against your ethical code? It goes against my ethical code. - I've seen your movies, man. You don't have an ethical code. Plus, with my idea, you don't have to waste money on make-up and effects. - What about... What about crew, cameras, and all that? - Jesus Patrick, I gotta come up with all the answers for you? Goddamn. I fucking hate movies. ¶¶¶¶ [Deep bass electronic] ¶¶¶¶ [Organ] Female Announcer [British accent]: The Milgram Group proudly presents: Celebrity Autopsy The Milgram Group. Let us entertain you. Welcome to this week's episode of "Celebrity Autopsy". It's so great to see you all again. This week we have another fantastic episode in which we celebrate celebrity. We will be performing a live, in-studio autopsy of a really famous celebrity. He is an internet star. A rapper. And an international movie star. He is "The Killa". The rise from internet star to star of the silver screen came quickly for The Killa. All that you've done for me. You changed my life, truly. This means so much more to me this time. I don't know why. I think the first time I hardly felt it. Because it was so new. I owe a lot to my players... To the cast. To Lindsay and John and Danny. And Ed, and Amy. And my little friends Jamie and Yankton. I owe a lot to my family. For holding me together. And loving me. And having patience in this obsession of mine. But I want to say thank you to you. I haven't had an orthodox career. And I've wanted more than anything to have your respect. The first time I didn't feel it. But this time, I feel it. And I can't deny the fact that you like me. You really like me. [Bang] What are you doing? Ginger: I don't have a light. Do you? - No, you know I don't. - Then I'll have to be resourceful. Did I wake you? - No, I was still up. - That's very un-Grace. Very ungraceful. There's nothing in here but booze. You missed out tonight. There was a closing party for some play. Nothing was free, obviously. It was theatre. But there were some people there. Apparently, there's new show starting soon. I might be able to get you in. But the spots might be filled. That's why you need to come with me. Oh, I'm doing ok. What's going on here? What do you mean? I mean, it's past nine o'clock on a school night. And not only are you still up. But you wanna drink? Can't I just have a drink? Hmmm. There's something going on here. I got cast in a movie! What movie? Um, the horror film I auditioned for a few weeks back? Incredible Vikings? Incredible Violence. Who's directing? G. Patrick Condom. Condom? I've never heard of him. Don... Con-DON. With and N. What studio is producing it? Why are you acting like this? Because I'm an actor. C'mon. I'm sorry. It's a habit. Seriously, though. What studio? There is no studio. It's not like that. It's an art film. [Laughing] It's an art film? Sorry I got jealous. What does that mean? Let's just drop it, okay. No. You can't just say something like that, and expect me to drop it. - God, you're so dramatic. I've never heard of this guy. I bet you won't know any of the actors in there. And it's an independent art movie. So? I can't wait to console you every night when you come home. Well, you're not gonna have to do that. Because I'm to coming home at the end of each night. Not until we're done filming, anyways. Oh? Why is that? Because we have to stay on set through the duration of filming. [Laughs] No. We're in a house. A big, nice house. It's... Stop laughing. Are you even getting paid? I think so. I didn't ask. You have to see what's gong on here. It's some student film. It's gonna be a shit show. Then you should come with me. - Not a chance. I have real auditions with real films. Come on! I was joking about the real film thing. I just wish you could be happy for me. This could be the role of a lifetime. This could change everything for me. - Dramatic and sensitive. You're gonna make one hell of an actor. That director has no idea what he's in for. [Glasses clink] ¶¶¶¶ [Knock, knock, knock] [Knock, knock, knock] [Bang, bang] [Knock, knock, knock] [Door squeaks open] [Door opens] Hello? Hello? Hello? Is anyone here? Gross. Well, this must be the right spot. - Who are you? [Gasps] Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Did I just jump scare you? Yes! That is the worst. You must hate me now, don't you? I'm... That's so cheap. I shoulda made more noise coming up the stairs. No, um... I'm fine. Are you sure you're not gonna die? - No. I'll survive. And do you remember your name? Yes. It's... It's Grace. I don't know if that's true or not, because I just met you. But I'll take your word for it. I promise. Great. I'm Foster. I'm acting in this movie. And I'm guessing you are too. Yeah, I am. I'm an actress. Then you'll fit right in. Come on. I'll take you to meet everyone else. Okay? - Okay. ¶¶¶¶ You're a quiet one, aren't you? That's cool. I get it. When did you get here? About an hour or so before you. Did you get a script? No. Everyone's in here? Yeah. Why? Nothing. Now, I know you're nervous. But try not to be. Because actors can smell fear. Everyone. This is Grace. Hi. Hi Grace. Let's get you a mask. Ok. These were just in the house when we got here. I think it'll be fun if we dress up and get to know each other. Don't you find when you wear a mask you can be more open? Like on Halloween, how you go out dressed up. And you can be more yourself. Or maybe you can be who you're dressed up as. Obviously you recognize where these masks came from. No, I don't. Oh, somebody wasn't paying attention in acting school. I didn't go to acting school. And you still got a part in a movie? That's so cool. Thanks. I've always wanted to be an actress. Actor. Women are called actors now, just like the men. But you didn't go to acting school. So you probably wouldn't know that. So don't worry about. Ahhh, that's the chorus mask. In Greek plays the chorus represented the morality of the actions of the characters in the play. They sort of spoke for the audience. They're boring. Pick something else. Are you happy? Or sad? Okay everyone. Let's go play. Hey Pa. It's me. Your boy. You never really thought that much of me, did ya? You never really thought I was much of a fighter either. But you were wrong. I been fighting my whole life. And sometimes I think there's no other way. But time's past. I'm a grown ass man now. Tick tock. Tick tock. You should know. You wanna know what time it is? It's beating the clock. That's what time it is. Grace: Dear Meryl It's the first day of production of my first movie. And, I already feel like I've grown so much, as an artist and as a person. I feel like this is going to be a life changing experience. And I'm going to emerge a fully formed actor. I never knew that acting could be so fulfilling. Also, did you know that actresses are called actors now? It's trailblazers like you that made that happen. I now know that this is my true calling. And I'm already sad that one day that this movie will end. And I'll have to go back home. [Knock on door] Audrey, hi. Hi. I just wanted to check in and see how you're doing. Good, I'm good. This must be pretty foreign for you. In acting class, we'd always have courses on what to expect when you're on set, like a rhyme. And of course we were always paired with the film class so we got some practice in. But this must be pretty hard for you. I'm actually really enjoying everything. Yeah, but it's overwhelming, right? Here. Let me show you something. An actor's job is to enter the lives of people who are different from us. And let others feel what that feels like. And once we understand the plight of others, we can treat their journey with respect, with empathy. Actors have the most important job in the world. [Soft whispering] [Printing sound] I don't think we're safe in this house. I don't think we're safe in this house. I don't think we're safe in this house. I don't... I don't think we're- ¶¶¶¶ [Pounding party music] ¶¶¶¶ Audrey: C'mon. Get him in the chair. [Laughing] Okay! That's pretty tight. Pretty good. You like that, Elizabeth? [Slap] Arrgh! ¶¶¶¶ [Keyboard clicking] [Printer sound] Foster: What did it say? Sophia: To show my tits. [Door opens] Grace. What's wrong? I don't think we're safe in this house. Well, do it. If the script said so... Come on, do it. Do it. Do it. Foster: Do it. Come on. Do it! - Do it! Do it. Do it. Do it. [Shouting] Do it! Foster: Come on! Do it! Do it! Do it! C'mon do it! [Door slams] It's completely unprofessional. That's a wrap. Huh! Ha! [Grunting sounds] You've been cut. You've been cut. You've been cut, bitch! Fuck! [Water running] ¶¶¶¶ [Deep bass music] ¶¶¶¶ Jeez! Foster? What are you wearing? You look ridiculous. That looks fake. [Knife on skin sound] [Screaming] [Slashing] [Gasping, gurgling] [Slashing] [Body falling on the floor] [Silence] That's a wrap. [Stabbing] [Sighs] [Soft whispering] [Door opening] [Door closes] [Footsteps] [Water running] [Alarm beeping] [Sound paper ripping of printer] I don't think we're safe in this house. Hey, Foster. Did you get today's script? Yeah. Why are we doing the same scene? Is that normal? It's not the same scene. Yeah, it is. No. Yesterday, I was just being slapped. And today, I'm being punched. ¶¶¶¶ We'll do it again. Okay. You ready? My cigarette's not lighting. - It's okay, we'll just use one of the cigarettes there. Yeah. You're right. - Alright. - Wait. - Come one. Let's go. - Let's do it. Okay! - Go! Go! - Alright, here. Oh, shit. [Coughing] - Are you okay? - Yeah, whatever. ¶¶¶¶ Get him in the chair. - What? - Get him in the chair. In the chair? Alright. Okay. Get him in the chair. [Door opens and closes] Coroner: You know, just by tuning in, you're doing a great- service. And there's really nothing more I could ask for. But if I could ask for something more - It would be a small donation. If the program means that much to you. These bodies, they aren't... They aren't easy to find and secure the rights to. So please, if you like what we do here. If you enjoy the program. If you feel that we are providing you with a service- It doesn't have to be a thousand dollars. We're not looking to get rich here. A hundred dollars is fine. Every penny counts. Audrey: Grace? What's wrong? Grace? What's wrong? Grace? What's wrong? Grace? Grace? What's wrong? I don't think we're safe in this house. Grace. You ruined the take. Where were you? I'm not doing this again. [Knocking] Audrey, can we talk? [Door opens] Can I come in? Okay. Look. I'm sorry about earlier in the scene. I - I got distracted. And I know it's not an excuse. It's just what happened. I wasn't even embarrassed for you when you said you didn't go to acting school. I should have been. You're not an actor. [Printer sound] [Muffled sounds] Is somebody there? [Footsteps slowly approaching] [Footsteps leaving] [Footsteps running up the stairs] [Door slams] [Heavy breathing] [Whispering] It's Thursday. It's Thursday. It's Thursday. [Gasping] [Screaming] [Cartilage crunching] [Gasping] [Crying] [Gasping] No! Please! Shhhh. [Gasping] Noo! [Screaming] [Bones crunching] [Grunting] [Alarm clock beeping] [Printer sound] [Knocking] Foster: I think I'm being pushed toward something. By who? I don't know what. The slap. And then the punch. They're antagonizing me. Reminds me of this experiment they did back in the 'fifties- to try to figure out why everyone in Germany was so crazy and evil. I don't know it. Basically, a guy would come into a room, and there'd be a button. Another guy, who was dressed like a doctor- He would tell him to push the button. And when he did, he'd hear someone cry out in agony in another room. And then the doctor would tell him to push the button again. And the experiment was to figure out if he'd push the button knowing that it would cause someone he didn't know, pain. I wouldn't push it. I'd like to think so too. Turns out, most people would. They thought is was the doctor's responsibility. They were just doing what they were told. [Printer sound] ¶¶¶¶ Elizabeth. Stop. Stop! Fuck! Stop! Elizabeth. Elizabeth! Stop it. Elizabeth, this isn't in the script. Stop it. It's not in the script. Stop it. Ahhhh! It's not in your script. What are you doing? Stop it Elizabeth. Stop it. Get me out of here. What are you doing? No. No. Relax. No. I don't wanna do this anymore. No. Stop it. I don't wanna do this anymore. Please stop it. - Relax. I don't wanna do this Elizabeth. Stop it! Would you - Would you stop it! Relax, big boy. I can do all the work. Whoa, whoa whoa, what the fuck? What's that? What's that? Elizabeth stop it! Stop the take. Grace! Grace, stop the take! Grace: I don't think we're safe in this house! What was that about? It was in the script. So you were saying. What if Grace didn't come in that room? What were you gonna do, huh? No! You try something like that again, I swear to God, I will hurt you. Yeah. You don't have to worry. Your little girlfriend will rush in and save you. I mean it, Elizabeth. What are you talking about? [Printer sound] I think we should leave. Why? I don't think this is gonna end well. We keep filming the same scene over and over, and it just gets move violent. - C'mon Foster, it's just a movie. - It's not just a movie! - We're gonna take care of each other. - Would you stop it! Okay? You're not in that room. You just come in. You say your one fuckin' line. And that's that. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I need you to promise me something, okay? I need you to watch Elizabeth for me. I don't trust her. I can't be alone with her in that room in that chair. I need you to promise me that you won't let her hurt me. I promise. When are you gonna eat? I'm just gonna have a glass of water. You? I'm just gonna have a glass of water. ¶¶¶¶ [Edith Piaf] You wanna know what I'm gonna do if you can drink it all? What? Nothing. You wanna know what I'm gonna do if you can't? [Gurgling, choking] Stop it. Stop it! Stop! Please. [Whimpering] Stop. I won't do this anymore. Please. What? I always said you had nice teeth. Stop. Now you're scaring me. Stop it. Do I look scary to you? Elizabeth. I don't wanna do this. [Whimpering] No! No! [Screaming] Stop it! Noo. I can't. - Shhhh Grace! No! No! No! [Printer sound] [Screaming] ¶¶¶¶ [Piaf crescendos] [Tooth cracking] [Crying, coughing.] Nooo. Stop! [Crying] Stop! Grace! [Whispering] It's Saturday. It's Saturday. It's Saturday. [Coughing] [Printer sound] Leave me alone! No! No! Grace: You went too far. Why didn't you stop me? Foster: [Screaming] Let me out! Do we have to keep him down there? It's inhumane. You know what he'd do to us. He said so himself. Coroner:¶ And I want to feel like Jesus in my heart ¶ Death occurred due to a cut across the neck. ¶ And I don't want to be like Judas in my heart ¶ A freak accident which happened during the production of a movie He was in Rainmaker. He was very good in that one. ¶ In my heart In my heart ¶ Then he was in Time Robber. He wasn't very good in that one at all. Tick tock. Tick Tock. What's the time? It's beating the clock. Hallelujah! Female Announcer: Let us entertain you. [Footsteps] Foster! [Screaming] Foster! Foster! Foster! [Slam] [Whimpering] [Grace screams] [Blood spurting] [Screaming] [Arrgh] [Whimpering] [Hyperventilating] Elizabeth: What is going on? What did you do? I woke up. And he was unstrapping me from the chair you left me in. - Do you know who this is? I've never seen him before. ¶¶¶¶ [Mysterious music] What is all this? Was that guy up here this entire time? Wait. I found a phone. - Foster: What? - I found a phone - Give me that. It works. It's ringing. Hello? It took me at least an hour to get here from the city. Well, if we got time... One more? It's not the time, Foster. Oh come on. You owe me at least that. I owe you for what? You know. Foster: Get down to your underwear now! Come on, come on come one. Just like that, right? Feel familiar? [Shouting] Does that feel familiar? Elizabeth: Why are doing this? Foster: This is just the beginning for you girl. Wait until I get you in that chair. C'mon and dance with me. Dance. Dance. Dance like you did before. Dance! Dance like you did last night. Dance! You remember? The grinding. Whispering. You remember how it went? Come on. Come on. Put some heart into it, Elizabeth. Put some heart into it. The cameras are still rolling. [Arrgh!] [Foster screams] [Elizabeth screams] [Door slams] [Grunting] Open the door! Open this door. Grace! [Bang, bang, bang] Fuck! Grace! [Banging on door] Screaming] Arrgh! [Screaming] [Knife coming out of skin] Arrgh! Ahhhhh! [Knife dropping to floor] [Crying out in pain] Oh god! [Grunting] [Tape ripping off roll] [Arrgh!] Grace: Sorry, sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry! It's okay. Just go to the door. Elizabeth: You know, starting off- This was my dream, like yours. I bet you have your best actress speech memorized. I do too. ¶¶¶¶ [Classical music] My first callback was for an erotic role. I thought that maybe it meant I had to kiss someone. Forty five minutes later I find myself in a room full of older men with my boobs hanging out. It was for a horror movie, actually. Didn't even get to die on screen. They just found my body, naked. Tits and blood everywhere. I got paid what the call an honorarium. Porn stars get paid more. Maybe I should have done that instead. I heard about this porn star once named Alex Jordan. She fucked on screen for a few years. And then she tried to live a normal life. And she got a ski shop in Colorado. It didn't work out. Her last interview was: Alex Jordan's fucking on screen and loving every minute of it. She hung herself. Elizabeth: Grace. Grace. You have to go. Grace! You have to go! We're sitting ducks here. You have to find a way out. - Okay. Okay. Are you gonna be okay? Okay. And Grace? You're a hell of an actor. [Grunting] Foster: I am a vessel. [Whispering] I am a vessel. I am a vessel. I am a vessel. I'm a vessel. I'm a vessel. I'm a vessel. I'm a vessel. [Getting louder] I'm a vessel. [Growling] I'm a vessel! [Screaming] ¶¶¶¶ [Music comes on with light] Elizabeth: Get off of me! Get off of me! Get off me! Stop it. Stop it! Foster no! Look at me. Look at me! Look at me. Look at me! Please! [Whispering] I know.... Just look at me please. I know you're a good person. Look at me, please! [Screaming] Foster, look at me! Look at me! Stop it! No! Look at me! Look at me! No! [Whispering] I know - I know you're a good person. I know you're a good person. No please don't! No! [Screaming] Grace! Grace! Grace! Help me! Grace! Grace! Where are you? Ahhh - Grace! Please come back! [Screaming] Come back! Foster! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! [Grunting] Grace! Come back! [Slurping] Grace! Please! [Grace and Elizabeth whimpering in panic] [Rope crashing at Grace's feet] Pick it up. - Why? You know why. [Shouting] Pick it up! I'm not doing this. - Pick it up. She's scared. - She should be. Now pick it up. [Shouting] Don't look at her! Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! Pick it up! It's between you and her. It's between you and her. Do you think she'd think about it? Elizabeth? Don't talk to her! Talk to me. Talk to me. Act. Okay? Please, don't make me do this. - Why? Please don't make me do this! - Why? Don't make me do this! - Do you need me to write it down for you? You need me to write it down? - No! Here! Here's your fucking script. Grace kills Elizabeth. I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry. - It's too late. It's too late. No. Just stop. Just stop for a minute. Because I can't. And I don't know what I'm doing. And I need you to stop. - You're falling apart. - I just need a minute to think. - Pick it up! - No! - Pick it up! - No! I'm not gonna pick it up! - Stop stalling and pick it up! - No! Pick it up! Pick it up! - No! Stop! Pick it up! Pick it up! Pick it up! Pick it up! Pick it up! Pick it up! [Grace whimpers] [Whispering] You can do it. You can do it. Pick it up. Go on. Get up! Take it! Elizabeth: Grace please, don't. Grace, no! No, no, no. Grace! Please no! - Nooo! No! No! No! No! - No! No! No! Grace! You can do it. You can do it. You can do it. You can do it! [Screaming] Action! [Screaming] You can do it! [Screaming and crying] You can do it!

Screaming] [Choking] [Grunting, choking, screaming] [Crash] [Crunch] [Crunch] [Crunch] [Crunch] [Crunch] [Coughing, gurgling] [Death sounds subside] [Crunch] [Dvd loading] Female Voice: Through the failure of his late films, public demand... for The Killa was at an all time low. However, after his death, as you can see from this chart, his popularity rocketed to an all-time high. His agent, his manager, his production company, couldn't have been happier. [DVD loading.] Male Voice: Okay. Let's begin. You have pretty little eyes. Thanks. - Where'd you get them from? I dunno. - Okay. Are you ready to audition? Yes. - Do you have any questions? Should I look at you, or...? - No, deep into the camera, sweetheart. Yes. - You know about the project? Yes, I do. What do you know about our movie? It's a horror movie. That's one way of putting it, I guess. What else do you know? You say we're gonna be in the woods for a month? No cell phone. Are you worried about not having a cell phone? No. What about violence? [Whimpering, grunting] [Laughing] I fuckin' love movies. [Laughing] [Door bangs open] ¶¶¶¶ [Deep bass] [Vehicle approaching] [Car door opens and shuts] ¶¶¶¶ ¶¶¶¶
