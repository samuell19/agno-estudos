Mm. Want to grab drinks tonight? There's a singles jingle mingle happening at O'Donnell's. Sorry, my sister just invited me to her Christmas Navy ball this morning. I'm kind of her last-minute date. Mark had to go out of town for work. Maybe you'll meet a handsome sailor in uniform. Don't count on it, Sarah. - Morning, maddie. - Morning. So, it's a wonderful life is playin' at the rialto. I love that movie. Great! It's a date. "It's a date." You didn't even say yes. Wait. What exactly are you two, anyway? We've been on a couple dates. There's nothing serious yet. "Yet"? I don't know what you see in him. I know what I'm getting with Roger. It's easy conversation, and... We have a lot in common. News flash. The only thing you two have in common is the news. Hey, good morning, maddie. Look, I just got a tip from a friend in the da's office. The president of Norfolk bank & trust was indicted on fraud charges this morning. - I'm on it, Mr. Bailey. - This is where you shine. Bring me back an exclusive, maddie. Hey, what's wrong? That's a really great scoop! Yeah, I know, it's just... It's Christmastime, ya know? I mean, who wants to write about corruption and bankers behaving badly? I would give anything to get off the fluff beat. My last piece was the Moore-bacon wedding announcement. Mmm. That sounds like my kind of wedding. No, seriously, Sarah, I mean, come on, you get to bring joy to people. I... I remind them about the harsh realities of this world. Well, someone's gotta do it. And you're so good at it. Oh, my. I feel like I should be standing at attention. Relax. Even the most disciplined sailors know how to have fun. You just wait until this dance floor fills up. Okay. I'll go get our table number. - Okay. I'll get drinks. - Right. - Hi. - Hi. Two red wines, please. I told him we were together. He's up this way. Thank you so much. - Oh, boy. - I'm so sorry! We have literally been here for three minutes. I- i-i-i-i'm... I'm gonna get your dress dry-cleaned. Actually, you know what? I'm gonna go get you a new dress. I'm gonna actually go to the mall right now. I finally find a flattering white dress... Of course this happens. I'm so sorry. I feel terrible. It's... fine. Accidents happen. If you'll excuse me, - mm-hm. - I am headed to the restroom. - I'm so sorry. - Red wine, the enemy of flattering white dresses everywhere. Yeah. It's a fashion emergency if I've ever seen one. She'll survive. Although you might want to have your date grab your drinks for you next time. Oh, no, I'm not... Will do, sailor. It's "lieutenant." Grinch! Long time no see, buddy. Not a fan of Christmas? It's overrated. I better get back to my date. It was nice meeting you. Maddie! Over here. Merry Christmas! It's so good to see you again. It's good to see you too, captain Jenkins. No, no, no, you're a civilian. Call me Chet. I cannot believe how grown up you are. I haven't seen you since dad's funeral. - Yeah. - You gave such a beautiful speech, sir. Thank you. John was one of the finest pilots, and a great wingman out at sea. Yeah, he was the best. He would have been proud of you girls. Your stories in the paper, maddie, and, of course, you following in his footsteps on the Polaris, Amelia. It's my honor to serve, sir. It's a shame, however, that you didn't sign up for the Christmas tiger cruise along with your mom this year. You could have seen your sister in action. I just have so much work right now. Big stories percolating. A chance to watch Amelia launch a $65 million jet off the deck of a carrier, why, that's a big story. Not to mention we're gonna make a stop in New York City this year. Isn't it too late, sir? The cruise leaves Norfolk day after tomorrow. We carry 6,000 people on this ship. I think we can find an extra bunk for maddie. Maddie? Well, thank you, really, for the offer, but it's just so last-minute with Christmas being ten days away. Well, the offer is there if you change your mind. Sir! Ah, yes. If you'll excuse me? - It was great catching up. - Mm-hm. You know captain Jenkins is my boss, - right? - I know. - Like, my big boss? - Yeah, I know. I'm not interested in going on a tiger cruise, okay? I didn't want to go when we were little, I don't want to go now. I get it. Now, the more important question is, where are those drinks? Oh, um... Isn't that your shawl? Who is that, anyway? I don't know. I had a little bit of an accident at the bar. Some guy actually told me to have my date get the drinks next time. From the looks of that woman's dress, maybe we should the Merlot? Affirmative. Come on. Oh, it's Mark. I'm gonna grab this. Okay. Hi, hon. I know the military can be stiff... But are we really that boring? Sorry, it's just... It's been a long day. - There's your shawl. - Thank you. Solo again? What about you? Is your date okay? - She's a little traumatized. - Seriously? - She likes things to be... - Just right. Oh. Good match for you, then. Based on...? I just know most military officers are meticulous. I can be pretty easygoing. Spontaneous, even. There you are. Your tie's a little crooked, Billy. Mm-hm. Um, Dan's looking for us. All right. Is Mark okay? He's good. He'll be back tomorrow. - Look, I'm real glad you came with me tonight. - Me too. Ladies and gentlemen, excuse me. May I have your attention, please? The captain would like to say a few words. Thank you, commander. For those of you who don't know me, I'm captain Chet Jenkins, skipper of the USS Polaris, and I want to wish you all happy holidays and thank you for coming to the Navy Christmas ball. Now, as you know, while the Navy is not about self, but country, I look around this room tonight and I see so many fine men and women who make incredible sacrifices for this nation every day. And I'm not just talking about the sailors, but those who love them, as well. My apologies... I know we're not an easy bunch. And I can't wait to host your families on the Christmas tiger cruise. It's always exciting to me when they get to see what an incredible job you do on the ship. So during this holiday season, be thankful for family and for this fine country. Raise your glasses in a toast. To the Navy! To the Navy! Merry Christmas. ♪ Well, it's cold out, baby ♪ ♪ put a jacket on for the chill... ♪ Picasso diner's two best customers. - Merry Christmas, ladies. - Merry Christmas, Sharon. Your favorite table is available. Here you go. - Thank you. - So, maddie, I read that story this morning about the bank president. He's been in here. Seemed like a good guy. Well. Goes to show you never really know what's going on with people. That's for sure. And Amelia, I saw the photo that you posted of the Norfolk Christmas lights from your jet. That was absolutely stunning. Oh, yeah, that was on my night hop last week. As always, thank you for your service. So, the usual, ladies? - Bacon and eggs. - Chocolate donut. Last one. They went fast today. - Okay. - You are so lucky. I know. I don't know what I'd do without my morning sugar fix. No, I mean, 'cause you love what you do. What about you, though? You've loved writing for as long as I can remember. Yeah. Yeah, I... It's just... I don't know, it's not as much fun as it used to be. Remember when I was in college and I wrote that article about the firefighter who adopted the baby, and it was dropped off at his fire station on Christmas Eve, and he named her Noel? Oh, yeah, that was such a heartwarming story. Now she's ten years old, she's a straight- "a" student, and she just played Mary in her Christmas play. - That's amazing. - I know. I mean, that firefighter changed her entire life, and... Just wish I could write more stories like that. Especially around the holidays. Yeah. Maybe I'm just burned out. But you had fun at the ball, right? Yeah, of course. Your fellow sailors are very nice. Did, um, did anyone, you know, catch your eye? Amelia! You are relentless! No! Besides, I mean, come on, you remember what it was like. Every time David deployed I was was so worried. I don't know, it's too much for me. Yeah, but you guys didn't work out because your personalities didn't match. I just don't want to do the military thing. You remember how hard it was on mom. Yeah, I know. Hey, that guy over there. Which guy? There was a guy, he just... He left. Never mind. There was a guy there, I promise! Hey, it looks like you could use a break. Why don't you come on the Christmas tiger cruise? No. I told you, I don't want to go, okay, and besides, I have work. The chill of the fresh sea air will help clear your head. The chill of the air? You mean the freezing air. And honestly, I don't even actually know if I could be away from my phone that long. Maybe that'd be a good thing. Sorry, it's my boss. Apparently the bank president's brother has now been arrested. Look, think about it. No breaking news, no annoying texts from your boss. - We'll be in the middle of nowhere. - I don't know. And you'll be without mom and me right before Christmas, which is your favorite time of year. Okay, now you're just playing hardball. - Do it for us! - I... Come on! Ohh. Suppose I haven't taken even a fraction of my vacation time. So, sure. Yeah. Yeah, okay. I will go on the tiger cruise. I'll just tell Mr. Bailey he has to deal. - It's fine. - Yay! That's amazing! Ohh, it's gonna be freezing. Extra crispy, just like you like it. - Thank you! - Thank you, Sharon. Okay. "Mr. Bailey..." Hey, maddie! Where you goin' in such a hurry? Roger, I will explain it to you later, okay? I have to talk to Mr. Bailey. Sorry. - Hi, Mr. Bailey. - Maddie, this bank story just keeps gettin' bigger. Well, I'm working my sources, and I should have you something great for tomorrow's edition. Great. And then... Yes? I want to go on a cruise. To, like, Bermuda? No, a Christmas tiger cruise. A ship of tigers? India? It's a Navy thing. Every year the USS polaris hosts the families of the sailors serving on the ship, and they call 'em tigers and they get to see what life is like on the aircraft carrier and, you know, be together for the holidays. And why are you going on this cruise? My sister's a fighter pilot, and so was my dad. - I'm a Navy brat. - How did I not know that? I don't talk about my military life much. Eh. Learn something new every day. When are you leaving? Tomorrow? I haven't received a vacation request. I know, but I kinda promised my mom and my sister that I would go, and I'll be back on the 22nd. - Maddie... - If that's okay. It's gonna be very hard to fill your shoes. This bank story's not going anywhere anytime soon. It's really important to my family. All right. Go. Enjoy yourself. You've earned it. I'll give the bank story to... Roger. Thank you, Mr. Bailey. You look happy-ish. I'm going on a vacation. Does it include lessons from a cute ski instructor? Hot toddies by the fire? A warship in the middle of the Atlantic with rooms the size of a mattress. You really need to fire your travel agent. I'm going on an aircraft carrier with my mom and my sister. All I heard was "handsome fighter pilots in uniform." Now, that's what I call a vay-cay. I'll do some recon for you. I like tall, dark and single. Noted. Sensible shoes, check. Comfy pjs, check. Sleep mask. I miss you every day, dad. Oh, wow, look! Oh! Your dad used to tell me that they decorated the ship for Christmas, but I had no idea it was this gorgeous. Hi, tigers! I'm Amelia, I'll be your cruise director. Oh, get over here! - Hey, honey. - Hi. - I'm so glad you came. - Aw, thanks. So, where's my little fruity drink with the umbrella on it? Hmm. Would you be okay to settle for eggnog and a Christmas feast with all the trimmings? Contino family! Aw, Chet. Thank you so much for hosting us. It's an honor, Elizabeth. I'm so glad you changed your mind. Thanks for making it happen. Oh, here he is. Just the man I wanted you to meet. Lieutenant Billy Jenkins. One of my finest f-18 pilots, and I don't say that just because he happens to be my son. Billy, this is Elizabeth and maddie. You remember, I served with John contino. Yes, of course. I knew you when you were this high. Well, nice to see you again. And nice seeing you. Again. Didn't know our fathers flew together and that you're Amelia's sister. - You two know each other? - You two know each other? We met at the Christmas ball. The wine incident. Would you ladies like to join us for dinner tonight? Yes, thanks! We'd love to! Great. I'll see you at 1800 hours. - Billy? - Enjoy the cruise. Let's get you checked in, get you to your stateroom. Okay. This is it. Watch your head. I don't even touch! - Aww. - - Call sign "daddy's girl." Yeah. Oh, honey, that is so sweet! Call signs aren't supposed to be sweet, mom. The other pilots choose 'em. But I got pretty lucky. They can call me daddy's girl any day. He's the whole reason I became a pilot. Oh, and there's the grinch. Ooh, he's a mean one, that grinch. Attention, tigers. The USS polaris is now departing. Happy sailing, everyone! Too late to turn back now, unless you got one heck of a backstroke. See you at dinner. Come on, I'll show you the rest. I just want to touch it! Ladies, welcome. Please, have a seat. Oh, my gosh, it looks so beautiful! Thank you. We take our christmases very seriously on the polaris. Obviously. How do you decorate something that looks like a rhino in a rainstorm? Not to mention its size. I'm guessing, what... Oh, thank you... 125 maybe eight-foot Christmas trees laid end to end? Well, I've never quite heard it put that way before. Maddie has quite a way with words sometimes, don't you, darling? Well, the senior chief who runs the post office is in charge of all things Christmas, and he's been here forever. Waste of time if you ask me. Ships are for combat... Not Christmas. And that is why they call him the grinch. Great fighter pilot, but a bit of a Christmas curmudgeon. Oh, forgive my manners. Charlotte, welcome. Thank you for the invite, captain. Hmm. This is Elizabeth, maddie, Amelia. I flew with the girls' father. Oh! Nice to meet you all. Charlotte is a successful writer. Oh. What do you write about? Romance. I'm a big traveler, so I find amazing love stories from around the world and turn them into novels. Wow, how interesting. You know, I met Billy's mother on a Christmas tiger cruise about 35 years ago. - Really? - Mm-hm. I was a young lieutenant at the time, and Barbara was a college student visiting her brother. How's that for a unique love story? Without the happy ending. So your father was looking for Christmas presents for you girls at a flea market in Japan. And he asked the vendor for a doll... Using his best Japanese, of course. Well, she thought he said... "Cat." Well, your father, he was so confused. I remember those little Japanese dolls. Yeah. He bought you... A kimono, Elizabeth. Pink with flowers, if I recall. Yeah. He did. It was always your father's mission to find you girls something new and exciting for Christmas. I used to do the same for Billy. Most kids find their presents under the tree. Found mine in the mailbox every year. Dan, hey. You made it. Sorry I missed dinner. I was airborne. Dan's a pilot, and Charlotte's brother. Yeah, they're, uh, old family friends. Mom said Dan and I needed more quality time together, so here I am on a military ship. So you're not... Not what? Oh, together? No, no. I love Billy like my own brother. Oh, Dan, that reminds me. We promised mom we'd call her after dinner. I hope you don't mind if we sneak out. No, not at all, not at all. Looks like we're finished up anyway. Yeah, I have to work the night shift. Oh. Can I come watch you for a bit? Please? - I want to see you in action. - I'd love that, mom. I'll get some coffees to go. Maddie, you want to come? - No, I'm kind of tired. - Okay. Thank you so much. It was just perfect. You're welcome. Uh, Billy, why don't you walk maddie to her stateroom. It's very easy to get lost around here. Okay. Ah, well... Looks like it's just the two of us. Can't believe you thought Charlotte was my girlfriend. Well, I mean, first there was the ball, then she showed up at dinner. I think it's a natural assumption. That makes sense. It's just funny 'cause my dad's always telling me that if I don't meet someone, I'm gonna be alone forever. My sister tells me the same thing. He say he wants me to find lasting love. Amelia wants me to date an officer, which is not gonna happen. Sorry, it's just military life is not for me. It's not for everyone. It's pretty amazing, though, that your dad met your mom on a Christmas tiger cruise. Does that happen often? Wouldn't know. I'm not really focused on that kind of thing. I'm just here to fly my jet and serve this country. You said something at dinner about it having an unhappy ending. What did you mean? Nothing. It's not important. Here we are. You might want to... You're facing the wrong way. - Oh! Right. - Yeah. Forgot. Man, these stairs are steep. They're actually called ladders. It can be a little tricky navigating an aircraft carrier, but you wanna use both hands on both railings with your back to the steps. Got it. Thanks. This place is like a giant maze. Twenty stories high and almost as long as the empire state building is tall. Wow. Thanks for helping me get back. Just call me a top gun tour guide. - Staterooms are in here. - Okay, thanks. - See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow. Captain? Huh. It's Chet. And come on in, please. - Good morning, Chet. - Maddie, hi. Now what can I do for you today? Well, I was thinking about something you said at dinner last night, about meeting your wife on a Christmas tiger cruise? Ah, Christmas 1984, yeah. But I should tell you, Barbara and I got divorced a long time ago. I'm sorry. Billy alluded to something at dinner. The divorce was tough on him as a kid. Well, military life is hard on any family. I hear you. But, you know, some couples do figure it out. Barbara and I, we weren't the first ones to fall in love on a tiger cruise, you know. Do you happen to know anyone that I could maybe talk to about that? I'd have to ask around. Everybody's kind of all over the place these days. Thanks. There must be such rich history on this ship. Well, if you're interested, we do have an archives room. Photos, records. You might find something in there. I'd love to take a look. What's this for, anyway? A story? Maybe, I... I don't really know yet. Well, I'd find it interesting. Tell you what, I'll have Billy take you for a look around. He can help you with anything you need. Sir, do you think he's gonna be okay with that? Romance and Christmas? Honestly... No! But it might do him some good. No. I have flight ops, and we're trying to finish all the maintenance logs before the end of the year. I'm too busy, pop. I'll clear your schedule. You get maddie whatever she needs. That's an order, lieutenant Jenkins! Wow. Look at all this old stuff. I have never been here. Oh, yeah? Wow, check this out. Wow, cool. B29. Hmm. Found some Christmas photos. These look like fun performances. Yeah, you know, we've had all kinds of dancers, singers, celebrities... Presidents, even. Yeah? You never went on a tiger cruise as a kid? I didn't want to give up even one day at home. All the baking, decorating the tree... I remember driving around looking at all the neighborhood lights. Christmas is the best. I'm just surprised we never met as kids. Oh. Well, I never went to military functions as a kid. I was always buried in a book or writing stories... It's kind of my escape. You cover corrupt bankers committing fraud, right? That and some other... Questionable people. Did someone look up my latest story? Yeah. Yeah, I mean... I do read the paper. You should write about the pilots on the polaris. We're the best of the best. That's inspiring. Yeah, an ego as big as a fighter pilot's. Look, an old journal. It was written by... A pilot named Sam in 1965. Wow, she's beautiful. Looks like a dancer. Wow. Great artist, if he drew this. What's the journal say? "We returned home from Vietnam "just in time for operation tiger cruise. "December 18th, 1965. "It was the first time our families are allowed to stay with us... "...To see what we do every day for this country. "I've missed everyone so much. "Today the most beautiful woman I've ever seen boarded the ship, and I helped her with her bag." He only got her first name. Dorothy. "I can't explain. The moment I saw her "I felt like I was looking into my future. There was just something about her." It's so... Undisciplined. Romantic. You know, there actually might be a story here, maybe a Christmas story. You mind if I borrow this? Yeah. You heard what my dad said. Anything you need. Great. I want to see how Sam's story ends. Is that a Santa suit? Let's see. Oh! Billy, you know, I think this looks like it's just your size. Yeah, if I wore two life preservers under it. I think that you should dress up as Santa for the kids on the ship. - It's not gonna work. - What? Look, I'm sure my dad wants me to get in your love story and suddenly discover the spirit of the holidays, but I'm just not a Christmas guy. Fourth of July. Hmm! Ten thousand pounds of crackling explosives up in the air. Now, that is way better than caroling and candy canes. Who doesn't like candy canes? You're not gonna change me. The military is my life. Christmas on a ship is a distraction. End of story. Fred Bailey. Mr. Bailey, it's maddie. Maddie! Are you on the carrier? Yeah! It's really cool... And cold. So why are you calling me? You're supposed to be enjoying your vacation. I know, but I think I have an idea for a story from here on the ship. What, like a war story? More like love in a war. What do you think about finding love on a military ship at Christmas? I thought it was supposed to be a tiger cruise, not a singles cruise. Yeah, well, some of the tigers have actually come onboard over the years and they ended up getting married to sailors they met while on the ship. I mean, think of it like... Duty, honor... romance. Isn't that the army? I wasn't being literal, Mr. Bailey. The point is, if I can find a couple with a love story for the ages, I think it would make a really compelling article for the Christmas edition of the paper. Love stories aren't really your Lane, maddie. And besides, I got plenty of Christmas stories... Maddie, you there? - Maddie? - Sorry, Mr. Bailey, 130 decibels flying overhead. It's really loud on this ship. Um, listen, could I just... Maybe look into it a little? Maybe it'll lead to something. Well, it's your vacation. So is that a yes? Well, if you find something, I'll look at it. But no guarantees, all right? And just remember, the two main ingredients for stories like this Heart and emotion. Of course. Thank you, Mr. Bailey. Oh, there they are! Look. Right there. "Last night I ran into Dorothy "in the mess eating dinner. "I finally had the courage to talk to her. "She lives in New York City "and works as a dance teacher. "She's as sweet as can be. "But her brother told me Dorothy has a fellow back home. "I hope it's not serious, because... "...There is something about her smile that gives me hope for the first time in years." Hey! Your mom said I could find you here. Yeah. Nice flying today, it was pretty awesome. Thanks. So, any update on our Christmas couple? Oh, curious, huh? Hmm. Look, I'm interested in the historical aspect of it. Okay. Well, I ended up reading the journal from the beginning, and it turns out that Sam did talk to Dorothy. But he just found out she has a man back home, so not really sure how it ends. Well, I went down to the archives room to see if I could find anything else, and take a look at this. "To Dorothy, 1965." Wonder if Sam made this for her? Makes sense. Your dad said there's a senior chief who handles all things Christmas, maybe he could help us. Yeah. But the post office closes at 1800. - That's ten minutes from now. - Yeah. Okay. Senior chief, I found this old ornament in the archives room. We know it's a longshot, but we were wondering if you might know who Dorothy is... Her name's on the back. Well, 1965, that was the very first Christmas tiger cruise. Looks like it could be from the ornament decorating station. It's a tradition on the cruise. Gosh, I have no idea who Dorothy is, though. We think a pilot named Sam made it for her. We're looking for him too. You know, my brother has access to military records. He works for the va. He just went on vacation today, but he does owe me a favor for decorating his house - last year for Christmas. - Great. What's Sam's last name? Unfortunately, we don't have it. Well, that's a tall order of eggnog, but I'll see what I can do. Oh, and this is Sam's journal. There's a picture he drew in here, we think... It might be Dorothy. - A dancer. - Mm-hm. You know, some years the uso performers come on the ship for Christmas. You think she might have been one of them? Maybe. There's a bunch of photographs and memorabilia... Down on the quarterdeck. I saw them when we boarded the ship. Yeah, exactly. You could check there. Meanwhile, I'll give my brother a buzz. - Thanks, Nick. - Senior chief. Merry Christmas. Wow, these photos are great. This ship has so much history. President Johnson. This could be Dorothy. Sure looks a lot like her. You know, there's a historical building for the Navy in New York City. Yeah? Any chance you want to go with me? I mean, we're docking there tomorrow anyway, so I could call ahead. Four years at the naval academy to serve on the Christmas version of the love boat. Not funny? You know my Dad'll throw me in the brig if I don't go with you. Great! ♪ The folks are shoppin', the temperature's droppin' ♪ ♪ the big day's almost here ♪ ♪ the lights are on, the trees are up... ♪ Oh! Look at this! Oh, I can't wait to see the rockettes and the the rockefeller Christmas tree, the decorations on fifth Avenue, but first, we gotta get New York pizza. Okay, she's gonna wear me out. Have fun, you guys! Now, the ship leaves at 8 P.M. on the dot. Don't be late. 2000 hours. Roger that. I think the historical building is right up here. Do you keep records of all the performances? We sure do. The older ones haven't been transferred to the computer, though. We've had all kinds of personalities to perform for the troops. - You said 1965? - Yes. - The polaris, right? - Yes. Do you see a Dorothy in there? Oh! Here it is. It looks like Dorothy milne. It lists her employment as a dance instructor. Just like the journal says. She actually worked at the ovation dance studio right here in the city. I could hug you right now. I can't believe it! The ovation dance studio is actually still around! Wonder if Sam tracked her down there. I remember the last passage in his journal said... "I saw Dorothy perform last night with the uso." "She's breathtaking. "It was like she was floating on air. "I got to talk to her again after the show, "and she's truly everything I imagined. "Sweet, smart... "But when I went to find her this morning, "her brother said Dorothy left on the cargo plane. "It's crazy, but I feel like I've known her forever. I have to find her after we dock in Norfolk." We might just solve this Christmas mystery after all. - They are so sweet. - Aren't they? Today's the dress rehearsal for our big Christmas show. Can I help you with something? Yes. Hi, I'm maddie contino of the Norfolk register newspaper. - This is lieutenant Jenkins. - Nice to meet you both. - Nice to meet you. - What's this about? We're looking for a woman who might be a military spouse. Her name is Dorothy milne. Apparently she worked here years ago. Yes. Dorothy was my teacher as a girl. I eventually bought the studio from the owner. Could you tell us more about her? She moved to New York to be a rockette, but her dreams never quite panned out, so she worked here instead, and would sometimes perform for the troops with the uso. Any idea where she was from? Kansas City, I believe. Do you have any idea if she was married to a pilot named Sam? I remember there was a pilot she met on an aircraft carrier. He came to find her after the ship docked. Surprised her with roses right here in the studio in the middle of class! But she had a boyfriend at the time who she said was planning to propose, so I'm not sure who she ended up with. Any idea what Sam's last name is? It was so long ago. After that Christmas, we were told Dorothy moved to California. But that's all I know. I'm sorry I couldn't be more help. I think we could use a snack right now. Have you ever had roasted chestnuts? No, actually. We'll take two. I got this. Thank you. All right. Let's see what this is. Mmm! Lot sweeter than I thought. Hmm. Kinda how I feel about you. I'll take that as a compliment. So, have you ever been to New York before? When I was six my parents brought me here for Christmas. - Before the divorce? - Yeah. It was our last Christmas as a family together. That's bittersweet. Yeah, but it was the best Christmas I ever had. Well, I think it's nice that you have those memories. Whenever my dad would be home for Christmas, we'd always go to the Picasso diner and we would get extra crispy bacon. It was kind of our thing. Extra crispy is the only way to go. - I know, right? - Yeah. - Here you go. - Thanks. Hmm. That looks really familiar. New York model train museum? Annual Christmas show! I went there when I was here with my dad. Yeah? Come on, you wanna go? It'd be fun! Uhh... I don't know. Oh, come on! You said it yourself, best Christmas you ever had. All right, yeah. Let's do it. Okay. Perfect. This really brings me back. You okay? Yeah, it's just, uh... I remember my dad taught me how trains work when we were here. And after the divorce, that's pretty much all we talked about... Trains, planes... Pretty much anything with a motor. You know, we never went too deep. Stiff upper lip, you know? My mom was the complete opposite. I think after my dad died she was just so heartbroken all she wanted to do was talk about him, but... I couldn't do it. - Why not? - It was too painful. I'm sorry. He died in a training exercise, right? I was 17... The day everything changed. My dad says he was a great man. He was. And he loved us very, very much. So all the times he invited me to go on the Christmas tiger cruise, I should have. Well, I'm sure he understood. It's not easy being a Navy brat. Yeah, well, it's something I still regret to this day. Look, don't beat yourself up over it. Believe me, I get it. All the moving around, the uncertainty... Our dads were gone for months at a time. Well, you're lucky yours is still around. You should Cherish that. I do. You know, he... He bought me this little red train... - Yeah? - At the gift shop here. Ahh. I drove that thing around on every surface of our house until the wheels fell off. That's really sweet. I'll never forget that moment we picked it out together. Cost five dollars, but... Nothin' meant more to me than that train. Do you still have it? Got lost in one of the moves. I'm sorry. It's the memory that matters, right? Yeah. Hey. Let's go check out the north pole train. You know what? I'm gonna get us some hot chocolate, but I'll meet you over there? - All right. - Okay. This is flight 747 to jfk tower, comin' in for a landing. Copy, flight 747. Proceed to runway one-zero-niner and wait for clearance. Psst! Psst! Copy. I brought Teddy here for the trains, but he's obsessed with flying. Smart kid. You know, Billy is actually a fighter pilot in the Navy. - Whoa. - At your service. Do you fly off aircraft carriers? Sure do. But flying off the carrier is the easy part. Landing, that's the hard part. That's so cool! I want to be a Navy pilot. Well, you can if you put the work in. Here. This... whoosh! Is for you, eh? Whoa! No take-backs? No take-backs, buddy. Promise. You just made his Christmas. Thank you so much. Have a great holiday. Merry Christmas. You know, you were really good with him. And did I just hear you say, "merry Christmas"? Yeah, well, don't tell my shipmates, they might change my call sign to "Santa." Oh, no, they'd never believe me. Hey, we should probably go get something to eat, and I know a place that's gonna actually change the way you see Christmas forever. Mind games, huh? It'll definitely mess with your brain. Come on. ♪ Snow is fallin' lightly on the ground... ♪ Brain freeze! They don't call it the colossal Christmas cocoa for nothing. You don't mess around here. We take Christmas very seriously. - Two burgers coming up. - Thank you. I feel like I don't have a care in the world right now. Honestly, that's not happened very often. That's how I feel when I'm flying my jet over the ocean, those moments when I'm at total peace. Until I realize I have to land on a ship that feels like it's the size of a postage stamp. Does that ever scare you? I love every second of what I do. The adrenaline and the rush... I don't think I'm scared of anything. Not even Christmas? Christmas? I'm just sayin', it... Kind of seems like you've been running away from it. What do you mean? Based on what you told me earlier, it seemed like maybe your parents got divorced shortly after your trip here. Yeah, well, after that, it was mostly mom and me at Christmas. Just wasn't the same without my family together. Just couldn't really see the magic in the holiday anymore. - I'm sorry. - Yeah. And I'm also sorry 'cause I totally judged you. It's okay. I know I can be a bit of a Christmas curmudgeon. A bit? Mm-hmm. Well, it's okay. If I wave my merry magic wand, maybe you'd think about embracing some new Christmas memories. - Hmm? - Like what? Like, you know, today, we... You made the little boy smile at the train show, right? - Hmm. - He met his hero. And we saw the world's most adorable dance troupe, and I wasn't gonna say anything, but it appears that you actually took a bite of your candy cane. I don't know what you're talking about. Okay. Yeah, I haven't had this much fun in a long time. Good! You're amazing. Why? The way you made me imagine our day like a living scrapbook. You really have a way with words. Well, I'm a writer. So... You're much more than that. It's my mom. Oh, my gosh, we have to go. It's 7:30. Uh, sorry! Forget the burgers! Sorry. Here you go! Merry Christmas. Yeah, merry Christmas! Sorry! Taxi! Taxi! Pier 90. - We're almost there. - We're never gonna make it. Maybe we should run. - Run?! - Yeah. - What?! - We can do it. Come on! Go, go, go, go! You're crazy! Whoa! Excuse us! Sorry! It's this way! Hi, Santa! Oh, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Merry Christmas! Wait! You barely made it, lieutenant. Ahh. Ahh. I can't believe we just ran 15 blocks. I know. Thank you for today. You know, for all the memories. The new ones. You're welcome, Billy. Sarah? It's maddie. Hey, girl. Are you surviving the high seas? Yes. I'll be back tomorrow. How's Mr. Maverick? How's the research going? You're no fun. Okay, so I have good news and bad news. The good? I found Dorothy milne. Really? Where? She moved to San Diego in 1966. And the bad? I can't find her after that. She probably got married and changed her name. The question is, to whom? Thanks for the info, Sarah. Anytime. And you owe me a mistletoe Martini when you get back. Can't wait. And you need to dish. I want to hear all about this mystery man. The only thing I will be dishing is Christmas dinner. Can you transfer me to Mr. Bailey? Uh, sure. Yeah. Maddie again? Can I talk to her? I had to transfer her to Mr. Bailey. Sorry. Maddie, did you get the story? Well, there's a man and a woman who met on the very first Christmas tiger cruise in 1965. It's all in his old journal I found. He was a pilot, she was a dancer, performed on the ship, and then he tracked her down to New York. Oh, it's such a great story if it has a happy ending. Wait. "If"? I hit a bit of a snag. I can't find the couple. Well, that is a problem... Because I need that article after all. Excuse me? Well, my feature Christmas story fell through. Okay. Uh, okay, I'll try my best, Mr. Bailey. All right. Only five days left. Find me that ending, maddie. Okay. Hey, Nick? Maddie! How's it goin' with your Christmas quest? Um, made a little progress. I learned Dorothy's last name. But unfortunately, I haven't been able to get anything on her past 1966. Did your brother call you back yet? Yes. He told me unless you're next of kin you have to file a freedom of information request for military records. That could take weeks. I don't have that kind of time. I'm sorry. No, hey, don't apologize. You've been wonderful. - Thanks, Nick. - See ya, maddie. Maddie, how is the article coming along? Um, unfortunately, it's not coming along as easily as I had hoped, but it's been a fun adventure and... Billy's been amazing. Billy? Wonderful. It's been, uh... Enlightening. Well, I'm glad to hear it. And I hope everybody enjoyed the cruise. And this time with my girls... Was just the best Christmas gift. That makes me happy. Family is everything. Apologies. I need to excuse myself. Work? Just a few lists I need to double-check. Excuse me. A toast. To friends... Family... And Christmas! Cheers. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas! Ho ho ho ho ho ho! - Yay, Santa's here! - Oh ho ho! Merry Christmas! Come on, kids, line up in a single-file line, everyone can see Santa. - You are a miracle worker. - Me? What happened on that trip to New York? Oh. Um, we just talked a lot about the past and the future, and... I reminded Billy what makes Christmas so special. Well... He seems very happy. Thank you. You too, kiddo. Ho ho ho ho! Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas, young man! I told you that first night I met you I can be spontaneous. Yeah, you did. And I was wrong about you. Where'd you get that belly, anyway? Two life preservers, remember? Oh... Good use of a flotation device and... sparkles. Yeah, sparkles. Tons and... tons of sparkles. Voilà. Not too shabby, huh? Is... is it...? Snow. It's the perfect night. Absolutely... Perfect. Billy, this isn't a good idea. Why not? I think you're so great, but whatever this is here on the ship, it's... It's not gonna work back home. I... I'm so sorry. I should go. Maddie, don't... Tigers, thank you for joining us on our 4-day cruise of the eastern seaboard. It's been a pleasure having you onboard, and we wish you the merriest of christmases. Sayonara, ladies. Have a wonderful Christmas. I'm off to Aspen to meet the rest of my family. - It's been real, Charlotte. - Real fun. Oh! We just had the best time, Chet. Thank you. You're welcome. And I hope I wake up to your article Christmas day. I hope so too. I thought Billy would have shown up to say goodbye, but... Well, merry Christmas, ladies. You too, Chet. Merry Christmas. Maddie! I'm so glad I caught you before you left. We'll get the bags to the car. Do you have the keys? My brother found a Samuel William who was a pilot on the polaris in 1965. That's amazing! What about the records? I thought we needed a freedom of information request. Turns out he was awarded the Navy cross for extraordinary heroism. He shot down three enemy aircraft in Vietnam, and that makes him a person of exceptional prominence, which is an exception to the rule of releasing records to the public without a formal request. That's so amazing. So where is he now? He went back to Vietnam in 1967 and, sadly, went missing in action. - Oh. - Did they ever find him? It's complicated. While Sam was Mia, there was a fire at the va storage facility in Missouri which houses the records. The strange part is, after the fire, the trail goes cold. My brother couldn't find any more from military records. So we don't even know if he's alive? Okay. Well, I have his name, I can do my own search. Yeah. Well, I hope it works out. Good luck. Thanks. Hey. Thanks for everything. Same to you. Merry Christmas, Billy. Merry Christmas, maddie. You stay safe, okay? Yeah. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. So... maddie told me that you had a great day in New York. Yeah, it was nice. We ended up at the train show. The same one I took you to as a kid? - Mm-hm. - Oh! Yeah. Brought back a lot of memories of Christmas. And memories of the divorce. You know, we never really talked about you leaving, pop. One day you just moved away and it was... The code of silence after that. I regret that. Somehow it just seemed easier to act like nothing happened. I-I just... I didn't understand, especially at Christmas. I just wanted my dad. I failed you. I failed your mom. But I want you to know how much I missed you. When you got older, why do you think I wanted you to be a pilot so bad? To follow in your footsteps? To... To be close to you. You are the most important thing to me in my entire life, more important than any career. Your career is everything to you. And I'm proud of what I've accomplished. But nothing... Nothing holds a candle to my only son. Thanks, pop. Maddie, how's my Christmas story coming? I'm still working on it, but I'm honestly not sure if it's gonna be done in time. Well, I'm counting on this. You have till end of day, then I'm gonna have to go with something else. I can't believe this. I finally have a heartwarming story worth telling, and I don't even know how to tell it. I... I don't know what else to do. Go get hot chocolate with me? With marshmallows? Lots of marshmallows? As many as you want. - Okay. - Lets go. So you can't find any record on Sam William? Oh, no, I found plenty, but none that match the age and profile of our pilot. So frustrating. It's like he's a ghost or something. I can't believe it's this hard to find someone. I know. It's a mystery. Sounds like you've had quite the adventure on that ship. By the way, whatever happened to Mr. Maverick? We, um... We kissed. What?! But it's not going anywhere. Wait. A romance grounded before taking flight? - Do you like him? - Yes. But it's not that simple, Sarah. Just imagine the wedding! All those handsome groomsmen in uniform? With their swords? Your bridesmaids in peach? That is my color palette, by the way. - A wedding announcement. - I'm convincing, but... No, maybe there's a wedding announcement for Sam and Dorothy. I like it. I don't know why I haven't thought about this before. - You're on to something. - Come on. Billy. Can we talk? I hope it's okay I came to see you. Yeah, of course. Is everything okay? Yeah, everything's good. Oh, I... I brought this for you. You know, just in case you find him. I... I can't believe you came all this way just to give me this. You know, I... Really didn't want to say goodbye to you yesterday. When you left, it felt... It felt wrong. You know? Like I was losing something. I've fallen for you, maddie. And before you say anything, I know how you feel about what I do. The military life. But... I was just hopin' maybe I could take you out on a date. We can see where things go. Billy. What if one date turns into two, and then two dates turns into three, and... Look, if... If this goes somewhere, it's not gonna end well. So is it even worth taking that risk? Remember when you asked me if I was ever scared when I'm flying, and I told you that I'm not scared of anything? Mm-hm. Well, the truth is... I'm scared of falling in love. But I'm willing to take that chance. Billy... i-I'm so sorry. I can't... So is that it? Maddie, what if our whole lives have led up to this point? What if you and I found each other just like Sam and Dorothy? I have to go back to work. Maddie... I'm not gonna hurt you. You don't know that. He seems sweet. Yeah, he is, but romance grounded, remember? Look. That's them. They were married on Christmas day in 1974. But their last name isn't William, it's Williams. They must have gotten it wrong on his military file before the fire. Fire? Whatever. You're a genius. Keep going. Last known address... Veterans home in Norfolk. Yes, hi, this is maddie contino of the Norfolk register. I was calling about a couple who lives at your home. Samuel and Dorothy Williams? No, I'm not. I understand. Thank you. What did they say? They moved out a couple of years ago and they can't give me any information unless I'm family. So close! Wait. Look at that. The call sign painted on his plane. What does it say? "Picas... so"? Picasso. - That's funny. - What? There's a diner I've been going to since I was a little girl, the Picasso's diner. Do you think there could be a connection? It would be a Christmas miracle if there is. Go get 'em, maddie. Hi. Um... Sharon. Maddie! Your sister joining? No, no, I'm not here to eat. No, I actually have a question about a story that I'm working on. - Is it about that bank president? - No, not him. It's a man named Sam Williams, he was a pilot for the Navy, he married a woman named Dorothy? Yes, Sam, he owned the diner. He sold it about 25 years ago. I worked for him as a teenager. Any idea where he is now? No, but I do believe that he has a daughter in Virginia beach. Lily is her name. Sharon, you are amazing. Okay, I'll see you on Christmas day! - Okay! - Thanks! Look! You've had that bear forever! Okay, that sounds great. I'll see you tomorrow. You guys, I did it. I found Sam and Dorothy. They live with their daughter now. My gosh, that's amazing! I'm gonna call Mr. Bailey, okay? Okay. - Maddie? - Yeah! Hi! Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. They're on the back porch. - Come on in. - Okay, thank you. Come on in. Mom, dad, this is maddie from the Norfolk register. - I'll get you some tea, maddie. - Thank you. Hi! Lily told us about this story you're working on. Yeah. Yes, it's just, oh, your life, it's so exciting. Do you mind if I record this? By all means. But I don't know what all the fuss is about. Well, from what I could tell, Mr. and Mrs. Williams, you just have such an incredible story. Now, tell me... What happened after the tiger cruise, how did you win over Dorothy? Well, her brother told me where the dance studio was, so after we docked, I drove seven hours to find her in New York City. Sam made it in the Nick of time. Practically had to duel the doctor I was seeing. I wasn't sure about that guy. But there was something about Sam. So I ended my relationship, and after a few dates, I knew. He was the one. We got engaged shortly after, and we were gonna wait to get married until after I got out of the service. But then I got called back to Vietnam. I told him I would wait as long as it took. I just didn't realize how long it would be. My plane got shot down in Vietnam and, well, the next seven years I was a pow. I had kept hope alive. But then when the war ended, two officers walked up the driveway, and I thought for sure Sam had died. Instead they said he was alive! I fell on the ground crying. It was the greatest moment of my life. What gave you the strength to not give up on him? I prayed every night that he'd come home. He had to. He's my one true love, after all. Okay, and, let's see. How did you end up at the diner? Well, I was an artist. That's why the guys gave me the call sign "Picasso." They were always teasing me because whenever I wasn't flying, I was sketching. But I couldn't make any money in art, so I opened the diner. But it's amazing that you figured this all out. Oh. Well, uh... It was tricky with your last name having two spellings. Oh, yeah. The Navy messed that up. They left off the "s," and I just left it as "William." I finally got it corrected to Williams when I came home from Vietnam. And do you two have any more children? We have two older sons in the marines corps, five grandchildren. And they're coming to visit today! How were you okay with just uprooting your life like that for Sam, for the Navy? Easiest decision of my life. Sure, but it's... An uncertain one. It didn't matter. Sam was my home. Wherever we went, all I needed was him. And I had the kids and my dance career, which always kept me very busy. You know, the USS polaris is named after the north star. It's the way sailors have been finding their way home for centuries. And in this case, it led me to Dorothy. Actually, I have something for you. Let's see... I think this belongs to you. Oh! I don't believe it! Sam, it's the star you made for me. Where did you find this? A pilot I know, he found it in an old box on the ship. It's a symbol of our everlasting love. Thank you. Did this pilot help you track us down? He did. Well, please... thank him. For us. Oh, I will. He's... He's a wonderful man. Looks so good. I'm starving. Would you wait, please? - Oh, maddie, you made it! - Yeah! No article's gonna keep me away from my family on Christmas Eve. - How'd it turn out? - Oh, beautifully, thanks to the Williams. I am proud of you. Thanks, mom. Okay. Let's dig in before it gets cold! Okay did you tell Billy about the article? No. But he came by my work the other day. Really? What'd he want? To see me again. I think you should. Mom, can I ask you something? Did you ever think about what your future would be like with dad? In the beginning? No. I just knew that I really liked him. Pretty soon... I loved him. You know, I never told you this before, but I broke off my engagement with your father. - What? - Mm-hm. The military thing. It scared me too. - Really? - Mm. But as hard as I tried to fight it, I knew he was the one. So... I flew to Japan to surprise him. Are you serious? Mm-hm. And he proposed again. In front of this beautiful temple. And it was perfect... Romantic... Mostly, I think, because that time... I knew it was forever. I had no idea. It was hard being apart. But we had this... connection, whether he was a thousand miles away or next to me at the dinner table. Yeah, but all his deployments, I mean, it was hard on us, I can only imagine what it was like for you, raising two girls practically alone. Yeah. It was hard. But honey, don't you get it? He gave me you girls, and you were the best thing that ever happened to us. And you, maddie... Oh, you were the light of his life. He lost his life too soon because of his job, though. A job that he loved. He cared so much about protecting this country. A life of service, maddie. That's something to be proud of. Mm. Hello? Hi, captain Jenkins. It's maddie. Maddie! Hey, merry Christmas. Everything okay? Yeah, um, sorry to bother you, but I was calling to see if Billy was there? Oh, Billy, yeah, he's, um... He's... well, actually, he's... he's not available at the moment. Oh. Um... Well, can you tell him to read the paper tomorrow and that I'll be at Picasso's diner at 10:00 if he wants to talk? I'll pass that along, hon. You enjoy your Christmas, maddie. You too. He's... not available? Mom, what does that even mean? Well, maybe he's just busy. It is Christmas Eve. Yeah, maybe. Mom, you want to tell me some more stories about dad? I'd love to. Bye! Thanks! And merry Christmas! Mom? Mm! I'm in here! Hey, merry Christmas! Merry Christmas, sweetheart. Look. Here it is. That's it? Oh, maddie! I can't wait to read it. - Okay. - Where's my glasses? - They're right here. - Thank you. I'll get the coffee started. Oh, maddie. "By maddie contino." Hm. - Hi. - Merry Christmas, son. Merry Christmas, pop. I think you need to read her article. She may have had a... Change of heart. - Thanks, pop. - Sure. "I grew up as a Navy brat, and I loved my father, "but I always resented that his job took him away from us. "Last week I took an unexpected cruise of a lifetime. "There were no midnight buffets "or pool parties on the lido deck. "It was a chilly Christmas tiger cruise aboard the USS polaris. "While I was there, I discovered a special couple "who changed the way I see love and family and the military." Oh... Wow. Maddie, you have really outdone yourself. Thanks, mom. - Hello? - Maddie. It's Mr. Bailey. Mr. Bailey, hi! - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Look, I just wanted to personally thank you for this story. It was powerful, emotional, and, well, personal. You should be proud. Thank you, Mr. Bailey. Um, listen, I've been thinking a lot about my career lately, and I was wondering, um... Do you think I could cover the military beat? I just think there are so many important stories to tell, powerful stories, and our sailors are what make this community so special. I think we might be able to arrange that. Let's talk after the holiday. You need a real break. Okay, I... I look forward to it. Thank you so much. Have a wonderful Christmas. You too. So, what'd he say? I think he's gonna go for it. Maddie! Good article, right? Amazing article. I gotta hand it to maddie, she found an incredible love story. And what about your own story? - Pop, you mind if I...? - Go. Christmas cappuccinos on the patio. Perfect. This is the perfect Christmas. We're all together, and your future award-winning story has just been published. - Yay! - Thanks, Amelia. Honey, if it's meant to be. All right, shall we get this show on the road? Yeah, let's go. Billy. Merry Christmas, Billy. Merry Christmas. So I, uh, read your article. You learned a lot from your time in the Navy. Four whole days. But, you know, with the tight quarters, it was more like four weeks, military time. You know, I knew there was something special about you from the time I laid my eyes on you at the ball. Spilling wine? Billy, I... I've never met anyone like you. You're... meticulous, spontaneous... Serious, but fun, and... And so handsome in a uniform. Handsome, huh? Uh-huh. And I got something for you. I, um... I got it at the Christmas train show. Oh... Thank you. Feel like I'm six years old again back at that train show. You know, you've made me happier than I've been in years. I have something for you too. Here. It's perfect. - Wanna dance? - I'd love to. ♪ The wind is blowin' ♪ ♪ but I can weather the storm ♪ ♪ what do I care ♪ ♪ how much it may storm? ♪ Merry Christmas, lieutenant.
