You know, sir, Hannah's the first girl I ever loved. And now she's back in my life. Which I think says something about her. Or not much about all the girls you've gotten to know since. No, no, no, no we used to stand for something. Nice shot. We rebelled against the establishment. Well, you kids had to invent things to rebel against 'cause you had too much time on your hands. And the baton continues to be passed, Gramps. Kids today will never understand what we had to go through just to watch porn. Oh, the dark ages. My grandparents married because life was too unbearable to go it alone. This notion of love and marriage came from the Renaissance, back when artists had time and money to sit around and jerk off and write songs and paint. Ah, history is so cool. Yeah, well, you kids are fuckin' it up. Boom goes the dynamite. But the marijuana has gotten better, I'll give you kids that. - Thank you. - Oh yeah. Yep, you're welcome there, Bruce the First.

She was pretty hot, too. - That's your grandmother... - For being my grandma, yeah. - ...that you're speaking of. - I know, objectively, though. It's been all right since she's been gone, but not quite the same. I don't know, man, sometimes it seems nice to have a little alone time, you know? I don't think when you're that old. I don't know, we used to do a really good job of growing old together. I don't know what we're gonna do now. Well... There you go. Oh shit, sweet. Hannah? - Hannah? - In here! Hey, honey. Oh man, I wish you wouldn't eat in the bed because we might get roaches. Okay. - How was your day? - Good. I actually, I found out that one of my friends from college lives here now, so I'm gonna see her tomorrow. And somebody's all set up in LA now. Oh yeah. I got you something. What? Best husband in the world award. I hope you like it. - You're so nice. - No, no, whatever. What did you get me? Yoga pants. You always are lounging around in your sweatpants, so I figured these are snugger and a little cuter and, you know. - Yoga pants. - Thanks. I love you. It's an amazing day, huh? Great day.

Um, yeah, I'm actually, I'm married to someone I went to high school with. I recently remarried. Oh, sweet. You married someone your own age? Yeah, why? This is LA, it's just that it's unusual. Just a little bit. It's just really, really hard to keep up unless you're married to someone who's at least 15 years older than you. - Why? - Because you look terrible in pictures. It lasts forever. Well, you do know about the arm thing, though, right? - What arm thing? - Yeah, well the, the arm thing. Are you not doing that in photos? No, is that? - It's really easy to pick up. - Thank you. Ugh. I didn't know I was doing it wrong. But we gotta work on those 11s. - What's an 11? - That furrow. - Oh, my forehead? - No, don't! - Don't touch your face. - Oh my God, why am I not supposed to touch my face? - Never too early to start on that neck. - Never, never. Is there something wrong with my neck? No, just the same thing that's wrong with everyone's neck. Well, you know, I'm just to the kind of girl who does Botox. Why not? - My husband would hate it. Oh. I doubt that. No, really, he's... He did get me yoga pants. Oh, exactly. He's basically asking you to try harder. Wow. But honey... Look, don't worry about it. If he can't handle you at your worst... He doesn't deserve you at your best. I can't cheers to that. I'm sorry, did you quote Marilyn Monroe? - Yeah. - Well, don't you think that's part of the problem? Like, maybe if she, like, had a man who didn't put up with her pill popping, she'd still be alive? No. That's a rose-colored glasses kind of a thought. Cute. Honey, what happened? - What happened? - I got Botox. - You got Botox? - Yeah. Um... My face is ruined. No, it's not bad. Ruined is a really strong word. You just can't laugh. Or smile.
