Over 30,000 people each year flock there right around the holidays, can you believe that? - That's a lot of people. - I certainly can, Tatum. Because I'm actually from Leavenworth. - Stop it. You are not. - Yeah, yeah. I am. Grew up on Lake Wenatchee. Let's see what's on Santa's weather wish list for Leavenworth. Oh, I know what they want. Snow, snow and more snow. Wait. Really? Are you serious? Yup, I just got the call an hour ago. Okay, but I'm confused as to why they would want me to cover it instead of the all-American morning dream team there. Because America doesn't only look like Tatum and Drake. America looks like me and you, Bridget Torres. Not to mention, your funny forecasts are the only reason we have people tuning into the nightly news. Girl, I got to keep it a little funny when I literally have nothing to cover in LA besides a no-skirts Santa Ana winds warning and the doom of June Gloom. See? This is why people love you. Tatum isn't funny. She thinks she is, but she isn't. And Drake's humor is, mm, debatable. The execs want your charm front and center this year for our big annual snowcast. And it's going to air on the morning show. This is the kind of exposure you've been waiting forever for! Yes! I don't even care about the stardom. My dream is just to move to a morning spot or a primetime. All right, so, uh, who is all going with me, then? Well, there'll be a few of us. You know, I've... Of course, I'm coming with you and Eddie's gonna come and play videographer for us. Oh, it'll be so fun. And they're not coming with us, though, right? Lisa, 'cause you know that would be a deal-breaker. Nope. No, no, no, no, they're not going with us. Okay, great. Oh, then I guess I get to be your and Eddie's third wheel in this romantic Bavarian Christmas town. Perfect. Honey, Eddie and I have been married for five years. We promise to keep the romance to a minimum. All right, fine. All right, oh, my goodness! So when do we leave? Tomorrow. We are going to Christmas Town, USA. Ah! I can't believe it! - Bridget. Hi. - Oh, hey, Bridge. Oh, hey, uh, it's almost kind of like that, but with an extra syllable at the end. Oh. You're so funny. I wonder, would you ever consider writing some one-liners for the morning show? Drake, wouldn't that be so cute? Uh, y-yeah, th-that would be... Wha-what are you doing here so early? You're usually here after we're gone. Oh, uh, yes, uh, I'm sorry I had to grace my face around here this morning. But I actually just had a meeting with Lisa about the annual snowcast, and I was asked to do the spot. So yay me! - Well, that's amazing! Congrats. - Yes. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Uh, now, if you don't mind, I have to go bundle up for some snow. Did Lisa talk to you about that? Hey, it's the first time I'm hearing about it. Wepa! Pero, titi, are you making tembleque? Si, si, si. Better back away, mija. These are for the ladies after Mass. Okay? If you want some, you have to come to Mass with me. Pero, titi, tonight we have a good reason to celebrate. So I've been asked to host the annual snowcast at Christmas Town, USA, this year, live from Top Of The Morning. Ay, bendito! This is wonderful news! - Mm! This is delicious. Mm-hmm! - The best. So when are you leaving and how long are you gonna be gone for? - We go tomorrow. Si. - Manana? And can you believe it? So I guess I'm just gonna have to pack tonight and then I'm gonna be gone for the next week. A week? Pero, sobrina. It's a week 'til Christmas! What about all the celebrations you're gonna miss? I know, I guess I'm just gonna have to trade in our American Puerto Rican Christmas for a traditional German one this year. No, no, te preocupes, titi. Don't worry. I'm gonna be back by Christmas Eve for midnight mass and opening gifts, okay? - I promise. Okay. - Okay. Well... Willkommen. Welcome to your holiday hideaway. I'm-I'm Wally, and it's really nice to meet you all. I see you met my son, Dillon. Uh, did you guys enjoy your drive up? Thank you so much for having us, Wally. Um, I'm Lisa, this is my husband Eddie, and this is Bridget Torres. The Bridget Torres. Famous forecaster, yes? Oh, yes, uh, thank you. Uh, it's so nice to meet you. And thank you so much for letting us stay in your home. - It's gorgeous. - Don't thank me. - You can thank our son, Drake. - I'm sorry, Drake? Drake, our son, who I'm sure you already know. By the way, kids, he is waiting for you in town. So let's get you settled in, and Dillon will drive you into town. I thought you said he wasn't coming. I said he wasn't coming with us. I never said he wasn't coming. It's Christmas, and he is from here. - Hello, hello, hello! - Hi. Our guests have finally arrived. - Oh, my gosh. - Oh, I love the ensemble. - It's so variant. - Ah, this old thing. Hi! I'm Millie, you must be Ed, Lisa and Bridget. - Hi, so nice to meet you. - My, my... You're even prettier in person than you are on TV. Oh, thank you so much, Mrs. Kincaid. That's so sweet. Call me Millie. Wally, are you ready to take me into town? I don't wanna be late at the Kringle. Ah, yes, ma'am, you just say when. Ready. Millie works at our year-round Christmas store downtown almost every day, she's done it ever since she retired from the bank. She doesn't have to do it, she just loves it. And our son Dillon here is an expert at everything in Leavenworth. He, uh, used to work at the visitors center every summer, so he knows any and every place that you might wanna check out for your upcoming, well, I'm sorry... - Snowcast. - Yeah, snowcast. Speaking of, any news on when all the snow flurries might start pickin' up? Right. Well, I'll tell you. Santa sends snow when you least expect it. But rest assured, we will get you your snowcast come Christmas Eve. Oh. - I hope so. - I know. - See ya. - See you guys a little later. - Bye. Nice meeting you. - Bye. Mm, I've been waiting all year for some yummy hot apple cider, thank you. Thank you. - Cheers. - Cheers. Mm! So what all is there to do in this romantic little town? I assume you're taking me to all the local haunts. Um, yeah, uh, I think we'll, you know, probably just wait for everyone to get here and then we'll go see all the best spots. Oh. Touring with the team, sure. That'll be fun. But what about when we're done? We need to make some time to, uh, celebrate, just the two of us. Our viewership has nearly doubled in the last year. Uh, i-it has, yes. You have, you have definitely brought a lot of greatness to the show since Susan has left. That's, that's for sure. Um, and, yes, that is a reason to celebrate. Wonderful, so you'll pick a place, and make a nice little rezzie for a fun little fireside dinner. - Make it a date. - All right. I, I will, uh, I'll find us a place. Hey, hey! - Hi! - There's the party people. Welcome to my hometown. Merry Christmas! Oh, thank you. We are in love with this place. - Oh, good! Hey. - Here's the man! Hey, buddy, it's good to see you. Dill! Bridget, this wintry weather look suits you, sweetie. - I love the hat. - Thank you. You are ready for a snowstorm, huh? Yeah, um, the Puerto Rican in me can survive a category-four hurricane, but admittedly, a snowstorm is not this weather woman's idea of a fun time. Well, I guess you won't be buttoning up our Jack Frost when we build a snowman. Will you? Guess not, but I-I'll supervise from the warmth of the indoors. Okay. - You do that. - Yeah, so... - Bridget, hi. - Good to see you. - Hello. - Thanks. Mm, uh, those ciders smell so good. I think I'm gonna go get us some to go. - Yeah. - Okay. Do you guys wanna meet? Huh? So nice to meet you. Uh, four ciders to go, thanks. Hey, can we get to-go cups for ours, please? Thank you. So... You didn't know that I was gonna be here, did you? - I did not. - Well, I'm... I'm from here, and, uh, you know, I always co-host the snowcast, so... you know, maybe we can just find a way to somehow get along? Right, yeah, I mean, I'm not sure why I'd assume this year would be any different. But, uh, Lisa was a bit misleading. Right. Would you rather I wasn't here? No, what I'd rather is have Tatum's job, and I'd rather you and I be working together. You remember the job that I didn't get because you didn't think I was the right fit for your show? Bridget, look. Tr... I-it wasn't because I didn't think that you weren't right for the position. That's not what I said. Just... Just what? Tatum was a better fit for it. Look, maybe we could get a bite to eat sometime this week, and, you know, we can, we could talk about it. It's, it's complicated. The only explanation I needed, you just refused to give me. So thank you, but, no, thank you. Ooh! She really doesn't like you, does she? Nope. Well, that's a first. Too bad, bro. You're really enjoying this, aren't you? Mm-hmm. - Stop it! - Mm. - A real Nutcracker Museum? - Mm-hmm. Do you believe that? Ah. Wait. Has it always been Christmas Town, USA, here or what? Uh, actually, no, it hasn't. When it was established as Icicle Flats in the late 19th century, it was really just a small town focused on logging and fur. - Ooh. - And, uh, Lake Wenatchee. That sounds more Native American, no? Ah, exactly, yes. So before the, the settlers came, the Yakama, Chinook and Wenatchi tribes were all over the area hunting for elk and fishing for salmon. So how did it become little Bavaria? W-well, after the Great Depression, uh, it started to die down a little, and then they re-routed the railroads out of town and people started to leave en masse. And then in the 1960s, the town leaders got together and decided they needed to do something to save the town. 'Cause the town already had these stunning alpine hills. It's not unlike those on the German countryside. They decided to change the town's appearance by completely renovating the town in hopes that it would draw in visitors from all over, and it worked. Ooh! A German bakery. Oh, the puff pastries are calling my name. - Everything there is delicious. - Oh! - Absolu-lutely. - Coffee? - Oh. Of course. - I'm hungry, too. - Bridget, are you coming? - Oh, no, you go on. - I'll be right there. - Okay. Do you see something you like? Uh, actually, I was just thinking that might be the perfect spot for the snowcast. Huh? Yeah. You're right. That's the, uh, the Rhein Haus. And we could probably get the owner's number from my mother who is working right there. Wait, is that a year-round Christmas store? Yes, it is, that is Kris Kringle, and exactly why my mother was dressed in her Bavarian best. After you. This place is like right out of a fairy tale. Welcome to your very merry little Bavarian Christmas. Anything you want, I'm sure we'd get a discount. Nah. - I know what you're doing. - What am I doing? That annoyingly cute Drake's Donations thing you do on your morning show when you give away things to families in need. I mean, it's... It's really nice you do it on your show and all, but it's not gonna work on me, Mr. I Love Christmas, I cannot be bought. Well, I didn't offer to buy you anything. - Mm? - Tsk. Merry Christmas. Hi. And, mm... - For you... - Ooh! Oh! Aw! This ladybug is so precious! I love ladybugs. - How did you know? - Ah! But this is not just a ladybug. In German we call her a Marienkafer. - And she brings great luck. - Really? Well, that's good, because I'm gonna need it. - Thank you. - Hello, dear. - Hi, ma. - Hey, where's everyone else? - Getting pastries next door. - Oh. And so you just decided to stop by and see your old mom? Well, of course, that and... We were hoping to get the number for the owner of Rhein Haus. We wanna host the snowcast there. Oh, hey, t-that's a great idea! Yeah, I-I'll-I'll text you the info. They're really lovely people. So, Bridget, will you be staying through Christmas? I hope so. And you can see me perform at the Festhalle on Christmas Eve. Oh, I would love that, but I actually have to get back to LA by Christmas Eve because I promised my Aunt Marta that I was gonna spend Christmas with her. - Well, that's very sweet. - Hm. I hear it's going to snow. - Oh, yay! - And also... I think it'd be good if we got some footage of those darling little stores downtown. It would be great for a opening montage before the spots. Yes, I think that's a great idea. Wow, we're goin' a bit rouge with our format, though, huh? Well, I mean, isn't that the point of filming on location? Just to have some fun with it and keep things natural, then get into the spirit of the season and see what sticks? Yeah, I-I think that might work with your evening forecast. And don't get me wrong, you do an amazing job keeping it lively. I-I just don't know for a big morning show with millions of viewers who rely on a more formal narrative format. I-I don't know. I don't know if it works. You know, actually, I-I think you both make really great points. So maybe it's a blend of both sides of the spectrum where we finally find our sweet spot. - Yeah. I agree. - Great. S-so we're in agreement, then. Uh, Drake and I should definitely work on a formatted script, though, just to get us into the moments. Right, uh, but do I think with Bridget here, we can use some of those moments and sort of in there forefront. Yeah, I mean, I don't need any charitable air time. Uh, trust me, I'll find my own way in. Mm! Something smells good. Oh, yeah, I think my dad made some traditional German meal. Uh, bratwurst, sauerkraut and beets. Ooh, fun. Hey, uh, been meaning to talk to you. Listen, I know you're not thrilled about working on this thing with me and Tatum, but I do think we need to find a way to get along, you know, at least until this thing is over. Yeah, Drake, I do not have a problem with you two working on the special. I mean, you guys are the stars of the show. So I'm just gonna sit back and do my little thing like I always do. - Your little thing? - Yes! Be the fabulous funny lady everyone loves to hear deliver "All your up-to-date forecasts at KQV!" And leave the big stuff to you and Tatum, everyone's favorite all-American hunk and darling dear from Top Of The Morning. No, no, that's not what the network wants. You heard Lisa, we are all in this together, which means the three of us do this together. Drake, I don't know what you want from me. Well, uh, for starters, we can at least pretend to get along while we're on air. Nothing else, for the sake of the viewers who just want a little Christmas cheer. Okay, yeah, fine, because the last thing I want is to spend Christmas being a Scrooge, anyway, so... Great. Yeah, nobody wants to be that, right? So, all-American hunk, huh? Says who? I-I wouldn't even know because, you know, I'm actually sleeping in the morning when you go on the air because that is the price you pay when you go on air hours after primetime, so, uh... Yeah, now, uh, if you will excuse me, I would love to eat dinner before primetime, uh, so... By all means. Okay, oh, yeah. Oops. Uh... - Here we are. - Whoo! It's really comin' down out here. - Ooh... Whoo! - Well... - Beautiful! - Whoa! Where are the trailers? - Trailers? - The hair and makeup trailers. Tatum, did you read the email I sent before we headed up here? We don't have trailers here, neither do we have hair and makeup. We said every day make-up ready. What? Are you kidding me? We are a network brand. In what world would I ever wanna do my own makeup? Oh, I don't know, a world where you actually read your own emails and know what you're getting yourself into? Ah. I can't go on camera like this! I barely put any make-up on. Tatum, you have flawless skin. You look the same with or without makeup. Okay, do you wanna go back to the lodge for a quick zhuzh? A zhuzh? Fine. Yes, please. - This was not in the script. - I will... - Take me back. - Take you back. Thank you. All right. - Who's ready to snowshoe? - Whoo! How did you do yours so fast? There's a bit of a learning... You, uh, you got 'em on the wrong feet. Hold on. - What? - Let me help you. How would you even know that? It, uh, it's, it's the buckles. Okay. Plop this around. Yup. Okay. Okay, put your foot now. You know, I'm not helpless, you know? I-I'm actually very good at a lot of different things. Um, I know many forms of dance. I'm actually really good at salsa and ballroom. - Uh, they're on point. - Okay, I believe you. So you don't have two left feet. You just get 'em flipped around sometimes, huh? Yes. You're good to go. Now key is the walking up. You got it? Easy, just nice and... Oh, easy, easy. - Just nice and easy. - Okay, I got it, I got it. - Oh! You're contagious! - Ooh. See? - No! - How're you supposed to help me? How are you supposed to help me? Okay. Okay. Well, Bridget, I don't know about you, but I am ready to get out on the snow, and hopefully not take a real fall. Uh, yes, I actually hope you're a lot more graceful on the snow than you are here on this, on this grass. And I think that is our cue to get this tour going. Are we ready? - Vamanos. - Wish us luck. This way. I'll stay behind you just in case. Oh. We're gonna take a while. All right, here we go. Do I need to hold your hand the entire time? Mm, what's going on over here? Hey, hey, no peeking! It's a surprise. Well, it smells like slow-cooked beef to me. You got me. It's my Bavarian slow-cooked pot roast. But I bet you'll never guess my secret sauce ingredient. Is it German beer? It is! H-how did you know? Oh, well, the bottle is actually right over there behind you. - So I cheated. - Uh... Wow. Sneaky little elf on a shelf. Sorry. You know, actually, if you like pork... - You have to try pernil. - Pernil? Yeah, it's slow-roasted pork, but Puerto Rican style. And we make it with a lot of different spices. There's a nice layer of fat left on the pork shoulder, and then we serve it with yellow rice and pigeon peas. - Mm! Sounds heavenly. - Oh, it is. You'll have to show me how to make it. Get me the recipe. Yeah, uh, I'll get it from my Aunt Marta. Wonderful! Maybe we can make it together later this week. Look, I am always trying to show up Wally. To be honest, he's a better cook. - Aw. - Mm-hmm. - Hey. - Those are delicious, huh? Oh, yeah, I always gain at least a pound eating them when I come home for Christmas. Oh, yes, uh, rightfully so. I would, too. So I was, um, just watching our spot from this morning. It's... it's quite good. Yeah, I guess we owe Eddie some credit. - He knew what he was doing. - Um, yes, he did. E-especially because he caught that part with you tripping over the snowshoe. Oh, geez! - So bad! - Whoo! It was money! - Oh... - Oh, it's cold. - Oh. - You're not wrong. Whoo! Yeah, I got, uh... somethin' for you right here. Just, um, you know, it's... Ah! - There it is. - Very nice. - Thank you. - You're welcome. You know what's gonna make this even more perfect? - What's that? - Some of these. Oh, please, I am... I've reached my limit. All right, I'll help you out, thank you. - Yeah. - Cheers. Dang it. I'll take the last one. Mm! I knew it. I mean, these antlers. These creatures are so majestic. And, wow, if they aren't just totally domesticated. Drake, aren't you just in awe? They truly are incredible creatures. You know, I grew up around some of these deer. They can live up to 20 years here on the farm. Wow! And-and... These younger ones, with the-the smaller antlers... - How old are they? - Actually... Antlers don't dictate the age, they shed their antlers once a year and grow new ones. - Wow! Can you believe that? - Crazy, huh? And let me tell you, some of these antlers, sharp! Careful. Maybe that's how Rudolph got his red nose! Prancer nipped him one. Well, believe it or not, some reindeer really do have a red nose. It's the result of densely-packed blood vessels just beneath the skin's surface. - No. - Yup. So maybe Rudolph isn't a rarity. Mm... Hey, everyone, we predict Santa's reindeer. Uh, it is raining reindeer up here in Leavenworth quite literally. Now, um, can someone please get this message to Santa for me? If your eight tiny reindeer ever get tired, these guys over here at the farm are ready to rock out with you on Christmas Eve! So nice to meet you. Who's next? Get on up here! Everybody say KQV! - Hi, I'm Tatum. - Reindeer! It's so nice meeting you guys. Yup, take care. - Have a lovely day. - Have a good day. - Well, that was a hit. - It was good. Yes. You are a bona fide reindeer whisperer. - They absolutely loved you. - Uh, no. Uh, what they loved was that magical reindeer food I coerced from the lady who runs the farm. All the same, uh, you had them eating out of your hand like you were Mrs. Claus or something. I-I'm impressed. Anyways, I mean... You really seem to have the lady fans eating out of your hand. Must be exhausting being so special, hm? Nah, I wouldn't think about that. A special guy needs special girls. Tsk. Where did you learn how to cook like this, Bridget? Well, my aunt actually taught me everything I know. She is such an amazing cook. And she got all her recipes from my abuelita in Puerto Rico because she has a restaurant there, so... - Just kept it in the family. - Very cool. - So, Lisa, how were the ratings? - Mm! The livestreams are a hit, playbacks on the morning show are up another ten percent, which is normal for the week of Christmas, but PR says that it's more so now than ever before. Wow, so I guess being on location is paying off then, huh, Drake? Maybe we should do this more often. Well, that and the fact that we have a special co-host keeping it spicy. Well, thank you, actually, both, for having me. Um, and, of course, Lisa and Eddie, for all of your hard work and the Kincaids for your hospitality. Just, it's been so lovely being here. What a wonderful holiday trip. - I concur! - Thank you. - And I'll cheers to that. - Yeah! - Cheers! - Salut. - Cheers. - Guys. Ooh, good girl! Oof! Oof, it's cold! That was sweet of you to take Trixie out for your mom. Well, it's, uh... It's been my job all through school since my mom got her as a puppy. Dillon is not to be trusted with the dog. Oh, okay. So, uh, you're saying that you're the mama's boy? Oh, yeah, I still am. - Yeah, I believe it. - Oh, really? I do, I do. So, um... What about your parents? I've heard you talk about your aunt. But... Are they both still back in Puerto Rico or... My mother was, and, um, my dad grew up in the US, but we don't really talk much. They separated when I was little, um... And he has a new family, but... You know, he sends money and birthday wishes every single year. It does not fail, I just... It's probably just what he can do. - That's great. - And my mother... She passed a few years ago. Uh, she was sick. Oh, man, I'm, I'm really sorry. Thanks. She got to see me on TV just before she passed and... It was like a dream come true, uh, for her. She really thought I had made it. You have. I mean... Look, you're on one of the best networks on TV, and really good at what you do. Yeah, I'm sure she's watching somewhere, extremely proud of you. Yeah, thanks. Growing up here must've been like living in a fairy tale. Yeah, sometimes. As you now know, my mom can be a bit whimsical. So, uh, holidays were always off the charts. But, man, summertime, that, that's my favorite time of year. - Yeah? - Yeah, yeah. Hiking and-and hot springs, a little weekend trip to Spokane. Nothing beats the beauty of it. Oh, I love it. Yeah, I bet. So, then, why would you ever leave? Well, I, uh, went to college in, uh, California, and... decided to stay. You know, I guess something called me to it. Mm-hmm. - How about you? - Oh, I grew up in California. 'Cause that's where my dad's from and... Um, then my aunt, she got a job sponsorship in LA, so then she came, too. And it's just always been just the two of us. And, uh, boyfriends? - Got any of those? - Oh, man, please. You know what I say, dating in LA feels like going to a store where nothing is available. So what is the point? Well, you know, maybe you, uh, just haven't found the section that suits your style. Okay. So what's your excuse for being single? Oh, man! I don't know, I guess I just... haven't found the right fit. Isn't that what alterations are for? - Wow! - I had to. - My mind is blown. - You're welcome. You are so welcome. Hey, uh, you want to go into town tomorrow? We can stop by Rhein Haus, check it out. Yeah, sure. And how about I bring Eddie's GoPro, and I will put my amazing camera operating skills to work? You're gonna be shocked. Well, I can't wait to see these amazing camera operating skills. Good. All right, all right, so, uh, sneak away seven-ish? Yeah, perfect. All right, here we are. Okay. And this is the Nutcracker Museum's mascot, Karl. Leavenworth's most famous local. Wait, he's even more famous than you? Oh, without a doubt. Karl was carved by Karl Rappl. Took 18 months to make. Came all the way from the real Germany to join museum owners George and Arlene Wagner's side. Mm. He's wonderful. Everything in here is. Yeah, well, you haven't seen the half of it. Wait till I show you upstairs. I can't believe it. I mean, there's just so many of them. - All right. - Uh, what, hundreds? Over 1400, to be exact. - Oh, wow. - Mm-hmm. Uh, it's-it's magical. I mean, really, it is. - Look here... - How long has this... How long has this been here for? - Over 25 years. Yeah. - Mm. Used to be a-a private show, and then they made it public and now people from all over can see. Yeah. Oh, and it's not just nutcrackers. - There's other stuff here, too. - Yeah. Yeah. Not just the kind we know from Christmas plays. You know, there's these European wooden figurals, the kind they used in Victorian tableware, all kinds made from ebony, metal, boxwood, you name it. What? Oh, uh, nothin'. I just... Uh, isn't there a big story you wanna tell with that camera in your hand? Oh. Yes, uh... We should probably do a piece, and, you know, give Lisa what she's looking for. But I just wanna enjoy it for a moment, you know? - For myself, too. - Yeah. I know exactly what you mean. - Hm. - Show you somethin' else. - Ooh! - Huh? - Right? - Wow, I... I'm not gonna know what to choose. Uh, do they offer a sample platter? Because I want to try all the things. Well, I can honestly say I've tried just about everything, and honestly, no matter what you choose, can't go wrong. Mm. Okay, then. - Not that that helps. - Not at all. - Hi. Uh, let's see. - Hey, how are ya? All right then, sir, I'm going to have a soft-iced gingerbread cookie with this pink buttercream frosting. A marionberry scone. - Oh, a tiramisu cake. - Yes. Oh, and, yum, I-I have to do this. Gigantic cinnamon roll. Oh, and can I have a double cappuccino just so I do not go into a food coma later? And what would you like? I wanna come back to get some pastries to take back to my aunt, but I'm just afraid of what I'm gonna eat. And I'm afraid if I keep eating with you, I need to ask Santa for some bigger sweaters this Christmas. So how long has this place been around? Did you come as a kid? Yeah, I did, this place opened up when I was about ten, I wanna say. And, uh, Dillon and I, we used to save all our money. We'd, uh, buy mom and dad these little cakes for their birthday from here. - Aww, that's so sweet. - Yeah. And what about in high school? Is this also where you brought the ladies on a first date? - Absolutely not. - Okay. I had a job in high school, I took 'em somewhere fancy, like Andreas Keller. Oh, okay. And what was this, this big job? I worked for the local visitors center, actually. You know, showed tourists all around town every weekend. That's how you know so much of this history. Well, to be fair, everyone around here knows the town's history. It's part of the town's pride. - Oh. - What about you? - Have a job in high school? - Yeah. I was an English tutor for young, Spanish-speaking kiddos coming from Puerto Rico. I still do it for some kids. It's just not something I charge for. Oh, that's, that's really sweet. - That food was amazing! - Told ya. I think we need to walk the entire town again to burn off all the calories I've had today. Or we can go say hi to my mom right here. Take a walk in the Kringle after-hours. You wouldn't believe how magical it is at night. - Yeah, let's do it. - Come on. Well, here we are. Okay, town tour guide, tell me more about this place. Well, uh, it first opened up when I was a kid. - Back in '86. - Oh, wow. Uh, so these places really are your childhood, then, huh? Hm, 100%. And my mom started working holidays here as long as I can remember. Started reading 'Twas the Night Before Christmas right here to all the kids every afternoon. Aww... I wanna be a part of that. So great. So how did she and your dad meet? They are so cute together. Trust me. It wasn't as romantic as you might think. - We met at the bank. - Oh. He came in to do a wire transfer, he asked me out on a date. I believe he was wiring his college tuition. So what did you say? Well, I said, "If you're moving soon to go away to college, well, then, no. But if you come back some day and I'm still here, then, yeah, I'll go out with you." - Okay. - Yeah, it sounds like dad. So, you said your aunt loves church. Oh, yeah, it's her thing. Well, I think I have just the thing for her. It's a snow-covered countryside Catholic Christmas church. Oh! It's perfect. - Thank you. - Wonderful! Isn't it a little worrisome they're still not back? They went offline hours ago. Oh, hey. There they are. - Hello! - Hey! Hola! Ooh. What are we drinking? - Hot toddies. You want one? - I would love one. - Yeah? - I'll go make us a couple. No, I'll help you. You don't make 'em good. Uh-oh. - Really? Oh, thanks. - Really! So how'd the rest of the day go? It was nice. Um, how are the clips? Oh, fantastic! And the ratings are still growing. We had an online frenzy of fans watching your excursions around town this afternoon, and over 90,000 viewers today alone. - What? - What? Which means even more viewers tomorrow as the onliners create a buzz. - Mm-hmm. - Okay. I can't wait to watch the playback. - You haven't watched them yet? - No. Wow! Well, I guess... Then you missed my, uh, clip making pinecone wreaths here on the property, too, huh? Yeah, I guess that I missed that all, sadly, but I'm gonna... I'll have to watch it tonight though. So what is it exactly you two were so busy doing this evening? We thought for sure you'd be back for diner. - Wally saved you some schnitzel. - Aww! That's sweet. Uh, we actually had dinner downtown, though, in this great little German restaurant in this basement. It was delicious! And I got to see the Christmas store at night. - So cute. - Aww! It sounds like the two of you had a lot fun. Well, that sounds cute, but I think having snow for the snowcast is a bit more of a pressing issue for me anyway. Um, well, I am gonna go to bed. What? Already? Yeah, I'm pretty tired. Uh, making pinecone wreaths without the help of my co-host today proved to be quite the daunting debacle. - Right. Well, I'm sorry. - It's okay. I'm sure you were great. You always are. Thank you. Goodnight, everyone. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - For you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Mm! Smells good. So, uh, Dillon said the clips were a hit? Yup. I was just telling Bridget. Guess the viewers just love the two of you. The two of us? That's rich. Uh, they probably can't get enough of Christmas Town, USA. What? Are you kidding? We crushed it! Okay, then, uh, so cheers to us and Christmas in Leavenworth. Yeah. Cheers. Eye contact. Eye contact. From the 155 Douglas Fir and Pine trees used to create this exquisite log cabin, to the giant hand-picked river rocks used to make the walk-around fireplace, this destination winery has no shortage of holiday merrymaking. That's right, Tatum, the Icicle Ridge Winery is a classic staple of our humble holiday town. So who's ready for the grand tour? That was great. Uh, now let's get Bridget on the grapevines. Drake, uh, why don't you come in during Bridget's, uh, spot? You could, uh, bring in a bottle, say it's time for wine-tasting. - I like it. - Yeah. Hey, Dill, grab me a bottle of your best. - Yes, I think... You know... - So just, I was... Um, hello. What about me? What am I doing? Oh, Tatum, uh, why don't you go pick out some wines for the, uh, sip-and-paint? And we'll be right there. Thanks. Um... And spanning over five acres of productive grapevines here in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains, Icicle Ridge is no stranger to snow as they get over 90 inches of snow per year. I mean, look at this, it's magical. Well, I guess that's one thing we can scratch from Santa's wish list. You know what I'm wishin' for here? What are you wishin' for? A flight inside from the freeze. - Flight of wine, that is. - Oh-ho-ho. Guess Drake Kincaid has jokes now. - I have my moments. - Cut! Well, that was a tree-topper on my Christmas tree. - Let's drink! - Yes, cheers! - Do it! - Good job. I don't know what I'm gonna paint! And here you go. - Ooh. Such service. - Yeah. I worked here in high school, and law school summers. You got a bona fide holiday sommelier at your service. Okay, so, uh, which one should I try first? Just go in the order of the numbers. Well, you can go in the order of the numbers, but I actually prefer to go by the tastiest. - And then I'll save... - Save the best one for last? My brother does the exact same thing. Okay, sipping time's up. Brushes down. - Eeh! - Let's see 'em! Your perfect holiday on canvas with acrylics. Nay! Uh-uh-uh! No peeking. You first. All right. My perfect holiday. What's in the stocking from Santa? Well, hopefully, season tickets to the Lakers. Oh. Okay, Tatum, your turn. I am dreaming of a White Christmas. Very nice. And, Bridget? So I went with a cozy little country Christmas stoop. Mm. So Schpatzel? Spetch-z-leh. Mm! Well, it is delish, even though I can't say that. So I will just eat it. This mushroom sauce is so good, babe, I'm in heaven. We have to learn how to make this at home. Mm, yeah, and, you know, if we replace the mushrooms with, like, melted cheese, and you have the perfect dish for kids. Hm. Oh, are you two thinkin' about having kids? - Ed, you didn't tell me this. - No. This is news to me, too, Lisa. I mean, look, it's not a must right now, but we think it might be a good time to try. We're not getting younger, and, you know, we both want a child, maybe two. And if the first one's like me, we'll have two. - Oh, geez. - It's like her, one is enough. - My God! Better watch yourself. - Wow. I'm teasing, babe, any child of ours that's like you will be the apple of my eye. Okay. Go! ♪ And all.. ♪ - Let's show 'em how it's done. - I'd love to dance. All right. ♪ In my arms ♪ Spin me around, little Kincaid. ♪ Just me and my girl lonely Christmas ♪ ♪ Need more presents underneath the tree ♪ ♪ So much that I'm givin' so much more than I need ♪ ♪ My holiday wish is only for this ♪ ♪ Under the mistletoe you may kiss ♪ ♪ Wait for the world just me and my girl ♪ ♪ Lonely Christmas ♪ - Hey! O-oh! - Hey! ♪ Let's turn off tree lights and I'll build a fire ♪ ♪ If in the shadows... ♪ Good morning. Here you go, one for you, for you. - And here's one for you. - What is this? Our script for the snowcast, of course. Don't worry, I left a little bit of room for Bridget's stellar improvisational skills just in case we don't get any snow, so you can have a little fun. This has you and Drake doing the entire snowcast and then just me getting covered in snow at the end. Oh, like I said, it's your spot. You have room to say whatever you want. Those pastries look delicious. I need coffee. Anybody need anything from the kitchen? - I'm good. - Uh... Um, would you guys mind if I talk to Lisa alone for a moment? - Sure. - Thanks. Yeah. Bridget, I am so sorry. I had no idea she was writing a script for the snowcast. - I swear. - Yeah, no. Clearly. But I thought that the network wanted me to host the snowcast. I know, and I figured they were just here for the week for the bells and whistles. But I mean, she's Tatum Tilson. What should I do? Call the network and tattle and say that she wants to open the special? - I will. - Yeah, I know. I guess not. - Um... - Look. Why don't you just work on your own thing? They can film theirs and we just do separate segments. But put yours first in the edit. - I will. - I know you will. Nope. You know what? It's fine. We'll just do the livestream like we originally planned and I'll just have to show the world that we saved the best for last. That's right. Oh. Is it wishful thinking that these, uh, weather patterns continue to shift? I mean, you never know. I really hope it keeps snowing like this for tomorrow. Hey, you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Never better. Well, what was that about earlier with, uh, you know, the script and Lisa and all? Oh, uh, yeah, that was just business as usual. Come on. No, I just was, um, a little confused as to what my part was in the snowcast. That's all. Well, I mean, it's exactly what we talked about earlier, right? - We're all doing this together. - Yeah, right. Except, you and Tatum are the stars and I'm just the weatherwoman. Okay. You thought that you were hosting this whole thing alone. That's why you were so surprised when you saw that we'd come here as well, huh? Yeah, I think there was just, um, crossed wires from above, I suppose. Right. Yeah. Well, I don't know if this helps, but in Tatum's defense, they didn't really tell us exactly why we were coming here as well. I mean, they just put Lisa in charge and... Yeah, that's right, and Lisa is a big fan of doing what comes naturally and-and producing pieces from the heart. That's why she and I get along. We produce spots the same exact way. And Tatum is the exact opposite. Both of you are. So polished, super rehearsed, um... But that's probably why you both work so great together. Also probably why the younger demographic doesn't watch our morning show because we're predictable and a little too stale. I always knew you'd skyrocket to the top eventually. And yet you still chose Tatum over me. Look, all I know is our ratings have been up all week. And I'm pretty sure that's because of you. No, you don't need to be co-hosting a show with me. You deserve your very own show. Thanks. Okay, okay, okay, first of all, um... I'd like to make a cheers to our eldest son Drake for bringing your beautiful friends here for Christmas and for helping us show the world a little magical slice of our town on TV. We're very proud of our boys and the men you've become. Aww... - Cheers. - Cheers. - To all of you. - So sweet. - Mm! - All right. Well, now that my sweet husband has finished his sappy sentiments and, uh, nearly made this old mama cry... well, I think we should all go around the fire and tell our best Christmas wish. - Mm. - Honey, you go first. Well, oh, okay, well, that's-that's-that's easy. Um, my Christmas wish, uh, this year is pretty simple, and that is to, uh, not screw up the Christmas dinner again, because last year your mother gave me some grief about the apple-sausage stuffing was too dry and the potato dumplings were undercooked. So my goal this year is to dress to impress your ma. - Okay. - Grandma, impressed? - Yeah. - Not gonna happen. - Better luck with that one. - Okay. Son, what about you? What's your Christmas wish? My Christmas wish? Promotion from associate to partner at my firm. Please, please, please, please, please. I think I can beat that. - Ahem... - Um, okay. So my very big Christmas wish is pretty simple. - Always the same. - Yup. - But I wish for world peace. - World peace. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you know me well. - Tatum, what about you? - Um... Well, I suppose it's a little late to be wishing for holiday love, so I will wish for chart-topping ratings this Christmas. I will definitely take that. But, you know, Tatum, the Wenatchee Valley Humane Society isn't too far from here. I'm not a dog person. - Uh, Eddie? - Oh. My Christmas wish, well, I think it's both of our Christmas wish, which is... - Well, you know what that is. - Yeah. - A little mini-me. - Hey! Bridget, I think yours is probably a bit easier to accomplish than ours or Drake's. Yeah, okay, so I actually had two Christmas wishes this year, and the big one is, you know, slowly but surely coming true, and that's for Puerto Rico to, you know, come back strong. Um, and the second one is, please let it snow tomorrow night. Oh, right. - Let it snow. - Well, cheers again, then. For all our wishes to come true and to let it snow. Let it snow! Let it snow! - Yes! - Cheers! - Hey. - Hey. Do you see it up there? - That's the North Star. - Beautiful. It's also called Polaris or the North Pole Star because it's the closest to the celestial North Pole. - Oh, yeah? - And... It's the one that Santa uses each year to guide his sleigh all the way home. That... Mm-hmm. Did you learn that in meteorology school? No! I actually didn't go to meteorology school. I took some atmospheric science courses and I know the math models a lot better than I did back then, but I got my Bachelor's in Journalism. Oh! I see. So that's where your love for reporting comes from. Yeah. But I've actually come to love the weather, though. It's always changing, but the power of its patterns always remains the same. I just, I love that. Did you know that today is the first day of winter solstice? - So exciting! - Remind me. - What solstice is again? - So... It's an astronomical event that's caused by the Earth's axis and its orbital motion around the sun. - Is that what you remember? - Somethin' like that. Basically, the sun travels the shortest path through the sky at winter solstice, which means that today had the least amount of daylight in the entire year, therefore making tonight the longest night. - Cool, huh? - Fascinating. And it's probably why it is so cold tonight. Yes, it has definitely dropped a few degrees tonight. - Hasn't it? - Uh, yup. And I am not used to this. So if you find me frozen before this all ends, you can tell my aunt that at least in the end I did not feel my toes, or a lot of everything else. Oh... Well, it's not gonna help your toes much, but... you just got to have somethin' around your neck. - Thank you. - You're welcome. You think it's cold out here. It's gonna be a lot colder back at the lodge, I'll bet. It was freezing last night, I had to get an extra blanket. But I got you guys some extra cider. - Thanks. - Yeah, thank you. It's, uh, the lake freeze. - Most likely. - Huh? The reason why it's so cold at the lodge is because we're close to the lake, and the closer you are to the lake means more than likely that the warm air from the land rises so that the cold air from the lake can fill in the space in between. Well, I don't know about any lake freeze, but I do know that it is a lot warmer over there by the fire. Yeah, we should, uh, we should probably get back. Huh? Yes, I would love to keep my toes. - Thank you for this. - Mm-hmm. Hm. So, Drake. Um, you and Bridget, is there something I should know about going on between you two? - What? - I-I-I don't mean to pry. I just, uh, I couldn't help but notice. I mean, I asked if you wanted to have a dinner while we were here, and you didn't think there'd be time, but you managed to find time to have dinner with her, and you two seem to be hanging out an awful lot. Well... I assure you, there's nothing going on between me and Bridget. And, look. Sorry we didn't have the time to grab some dinner and celebrate, but... I don't know, why don't we, uh... Why don't we try to have some breakfast Christmas Eve before the Festhalle event? Sure, yeah. That sounds great. All right. Lookin' forward. - Let's go get warm. - Okay. - Yeah. - Thank you. No, no, no, ma, ma, you'll do it too tight. Oh! - Here, ma, I got it. - No, no, no. Both of you away. Where's dad? I am here, right here. I've been up all night baking for today's festivities. Mm, those smell good. What are they? Lebkuchen, my friend. These are traditional German cookies, powdered in spice to perfection. - Uh, look, here. Have one. - Oh, yes, sir. - Hey, Bridget, hurry up! - I'm coming! Mm-mm! - There you go. - Thank you. Oh, you have some powdered sugar right there. Thank you. You ladies look absolutely stunning. - Thank you. - Well... I think it's time for a snowcast. Ooh. This is incredible! - Oh, and check it out. - Ooh! Hey! The weather doesn't cooperate, we bring the snow to us instead. Oh, my goodness. Snow machines? I love it! Where did you find this? The city is letting us borrow them. Yeah. They, uh, use them for events and stuff. Isn't it great? It was all Drake's idea. It's amazing. And look. America can think it's really snowing. Okay, wait, um, so I'm not gonna pretend it's really snowing, right? It's a schtick. Like, I lean into the fun of the fake snow and then just announce that the real stuff is headed this way? But the real stuff is headed this way, and that's what everyone wants to see. The illusion is still there. So who cares what we do on camera? America wants to see real snow, just like a real Santa. Right, so that's just it. It's not real snow. So why wouldn't we wait for the real stuff to hit the ground and then roll? I mean, we could. But what if the real snow doesn't come? I mean, Lisa's got a point, I mean, we know it's supposed to snow at some point, but there's really no guarantee. Right? I'm not sure we can keep the fans here all night. So, um, couldn't we get some footage of them now? And then you and Tatum can do your spot first and so on? Or I can just play into the fact that it's fake snow, have some fun with it, I'll promise the real deal later and then I'll do a pick-up tomorrow morning at the lodge with the real snow on the ground. Oh, actually that could work. Like, that could be cute. Like a-a quick Christmas Eve frolic in the snow with all three of you. Yeah, announcing Merry Christmas and Top Of The Morning, America right here in Christmas Town, USA. Yeah, sort of like a-a bookend to the spot, and we could do it as a, as a livestream. - Okay. Thanks. - Yeah. But that's not the plan. Is it? I mean, we were supposed to do the script, and then Bridget announces the snow, and then the snow arrives here in Leavenworth. - Cut, and go to print. - Right. But you're not the one doing the dishonest reporting, Tatum. Faking the forecast for the sake of sticking to a script? I mean, that's just making me the joke, isn't it? But it's not for the script. It's for the sake of the story. In case you forgot, everyone lives for a great story. It's junk food for the soul, right, Lisa? Not always. Oh, think about it. And if you don't wanna do it, I will. Um, well, I'm gonna go take some selfies with our fans. You should, too. You do what you want to do. It's your spot. Okay? Thanks. I'm just gonna need a minute. Yeah. Will you check on her in a little bit? I don't know what to do, titi. Am I overreacting? I mean, because maybe, maybe I am just the silly weather girl everyone says I am and I'm just making a big deal out of nothing. No, sobrina. What if your mother heard? You're so much more, and if the snow won't fall for that stuck-up show host, neither should you. Hm. Okay. Well, thank you. I have to go, we're gonna be starting soon. But I will see you tomorrow night for mass. Sounds good, mija. I love you. I love you, too. Muah. So sad you're leaving so soon. Really wish you could come to the Festhalle. Yeah, me, too, I've-I've fallen in love with Leavenworth, despite this cold. Yeah. Yeah. Um, you know, maybe when I get back from LA or after the New Year, I don't know, we can have dinner sometime? - Yeah, I'd like that. - Good. So tell me, how does this thing work anyway? Oh, y-you don't have to do anything. Just click your heels together twice and I'll give you as much snow as you want. Perfect, well, let's turn that thing all the way up 'cause I'm dreaming of a White Christmas. You got it. By the way, do you have any idea what's going on with those two? I don't mean to be a nosy Rudolph, but... Who? My brother and Bridget? Well, of course, sparks are flying. They have been all week. Drake's had a thing for Bridget for, for forever, really. I'm sorry? What? You didn't know? Come on. I figured, surely of all people, you would know. What's that supposed to mean? Nothing, never mind. Forget I said anything. It's... You know, it's not my place to... Dillon, tell me what you know now, so I don't have to ask Drake about it live on camera later. Fine, fine. Fine. Drake wanted Bridget, but I think ultimately the network chose you because they wanted Bridget to solo the nightly news to get the ratings back up. And Drake was relieved because he didn't want a conflict of interest on his hand because he had a crush on his co-host. - That's all. - Wait. - So I was a consolation prize? - I wouldn't say that. I mean, he didn't even know you then. I mean, when he came home last year, he said that you were new to the network. I was. I was new to the news. And apparently I still am because all of this is news to me. But... Whatever. Everything happens for a reason, right? And the show must go on. So... Good evening, everyone, I'm Lisa Liu Lawson from KQV News. And thank you so much for being here at our annual snowcast this year right here in Leavenworth. Uh, just a few quick things, uh, once our cameras start rolling, I need you to keep your talking to a whisper, silence your cell phones, and, of course, cheer on our commentators on air and... Oh, oh, yes, um, and don't forget, while you're here, before you leave, make sure you grab a bag of the yummy delicious Lebkuchen cookies, courtesy of the Kincaids. Now, without further ado, I give you Drake Kincaid and Tatum Tilson of Top Of The Morning! Man, oh, man, doesn't feel like a regular morning. Does it, Drake? Oh, wait, that's 'cause it's not morning at all! For once we are up way past our bedtime, huh? Well, it's worth it to see all these beautiful lights. Here we are in beautiful downtown Leavenworth, a charming Bavarian hideaway nestled deep in the mountains just south of Lake Wenatchee, Washington, where you can guarantee you're gonna quench your penchant for all things Christmas. That's right, Tatum, whether taking a stroll through the Nutcracker Museum or having a gingerbread party in the Gingerbread Factory, it's easy to see we didn't coin it Christmas Town, USA, for nothing. There's only one thing missing this week. A fresh snowfall. But I think tonight just might be the night. One can hope, right, but even if it doesn't snow, it simply won't take away the magic we're feeling this Christmas, and when we come back, a very special hello from your nightly newscaster always delivering your favorite forecasts, Bridget Torres. So stick with us. - Nice. - If it doesn't snow? Drake, do you remember when you and I used to be a team? Or are you so starry-eyed for the weatherwoman, you forgot? I'm not starry-eyed over Bridget. - What are you... - Fine. Whatever. Just know that you may not have chosen her for the show because of your little crush or whatever, but the execs chose me. So let's not forget that, okay? Drake, is that true? Because I thought you picked Tatum because of your commonalities. Bridget, look. I wasn't lying, all right? The choice wasn't mine ultimately. Everyone loved you, all right, but the execs wanted someone to liven nighttime news, otherwise it was gonna die. You were that person. And I didn't fight them because, yeah, I like you and I didn't want it to get weird. And I mean, we all know that Tatum is a great candidate as well. Hey, guys, uh, we're back in ten, nine... And we're back here with Bridget Torres, our favorite forecaster who may just have some good news for us. Yes. Uh, I believe I do, Tatum. Thank you so much. Now, while we may not have the real deal here, uh, faking it seems to be the answer sometimes. So, hey, why not? It's Christmas, right? So everybody say it with me. Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow! Yee-haw! Bridget? Oh. Hey, um, where-where's-where's Bridget? She decided to stay at Beaver Valley tonight. Y-yeah, Lisa and Dillon took her over just about a minute ago. Oh, I'm sorry, honey, I thought you knew. Thanks, mom. Oh, it's really coming down out there. Yeah, and my flight out of Wenatchee is on a big delay. Ugh! This is the worst. Son, you want some coffee? Uh, sure, please, thanks. Comin' up. - Hey. You okay? - Mm. Drake, honey, why don't you give her a call? - She hasn't left town yet. - Yeah. I was supposed to take her to the airport this morning, but all the flights out of Wenatchee are canceled or delayed because of all the ice on the ground. Yeah, but she has to get home, though. Hey, dad, can't your SUV make it into Seattle? I mean, I'm sure flights are running just fine out of there. - No? - Mm, probably. Maybe you could offer to take her there. Yeah, but I'm not sure she wants to talk to me right now, and... I don't blame her, you know? I'mma go outside. Morning. Mm, something smells yummy. Guess it's too bad Drake and I are having breakfast in town today. Really? Are you so sure about that? Why? What's going on? I don't think Drake was thrilled with the show you put on yesterday. And I don't guess you know, but Bridget left yesterday because of you. But good news is, at least your holiday wish came true. Ratings are through the roof. You're a big hit, Tatum. Congrats. Morning. I suppose having breakfast is off the table. Nope, there's still some on the dining-room table if you want any. I guess that's fair. Look, I'm sorry if I ruined things between you and Bridget. I didn't like seeing you have so much chemistry on camera with someone else. I've gotten used to it being you and I the world wants to see. Yeah, but, Tatum, you do realize there is no you and I? I do now. I mean, I-I've seen what's been happening with you and her all week. The whole world has. It's very... authentic. I guess I just wished it was happening between you and me is all. I'm sorry for that. I know firsthand what it's like to like someone you have to be professional with. It's... it's not easy. Right. And I-I realized pretty quickly after we got to this romantic town that it wasn't what I thought it was gonna be. And that's fine, I guess, that it didn't... And more so just... it hurt my feelings thinking that I was your second choice. - So... - Look, Tatum. You and I have an amazing show I'm extremely proud of. I have zero regrets doing this with you. I just, you know, I hope this show is enough, that's all. So I wasn't just some consolation prize for you, then? What? Heck, no! Are you kidding me? You're Tatum Tilson. Morning-show host extraordinaire. Come on. Thank you. And again, I'm sorry. It's fine. Everything's gonna be fine. Hey there. Huh. Hi! What are you doing here? I think you forgot something at the lodge. Aw. Thank you. I was in such a rush to get out before the snowfall got worse, that I just totally forgot. It's fine. I'm happy to swing it by. I'm on my way into town anyway to get ready for the performance at the Festhalle this afternoon. Oh, that's right. Oh, I'm so sorry I'm gonna miss that. You sure you have to? Uh... Dillon told us that all the flights are delayed. - Yeah. - A-any update on yours? Yeah. Mine's actually delayed until 8:45. It looks like I won't make it in time for mass, unfortunately. You know, I think Drake is a little bit afraid to talk to you. He feels so bad about everything. And I know he would love to drive you to Seattle to catch an earlier flight i-if you, if you'd let him. Yeah, you know, I just... I don't know if that's such a good idea. I'm just really not ready to see him right now. I'm still so confused about everything. Yeah, yeah, I, I-I totally get it. And normally, I am not one to get into my son's business... but, Bridget... I have never seen him this crazy about anyone, like, ever. You know what's funny about that? It's just that this whole time I thought he didn't even care for me. No, on the contrary. Drake has always felt you guys were a perfect fit. Uh, and I know he would've asked you out then, too, if Tatum hadn't muddled the lines and caused you to start avoiding him. Se fue al garete. Wow. Okay, so this whole time he didn't say anything just because he was trying to keep it professional and not throw these execs under the bus? - Yeah. - Wow. I don't know if I want to commend him or if I just want to, argh, scream at him. Well, I suppose if you come to the Festhalle, you can take your pick. Hm. You guys look great. Wow, this is so incredible! Isn't it? Oh, my gosh. Oh, oh, honey, I'm gonna take this. - It's-it's the network calling. - Oh, babe. Fingers crossed. Good luck. Lisa Liu Lawson speaking. Ugh. Should I go talk to her? If you think you should. I should go talk to her, shouldn't I? You think? - You should go talk to her. - Yup. Thank you. Appreciate that. I'll take a Gluhwein, too. Thank you. And I got hers. I owe you one. I... Thanks, uh, but you really didn't need to. You don't owe me anything, Tatum. Actually, I do. I owe you an apology. I never should've gotten jealous and I never should've felt threatened of you and Drake. He's my co-host. Nothing more. And I had no right to get between the two of you, so... - I'm sorry. - Thanks. But, uh, honestly, I don't even think there's anything to get in between, so... We both know there is. But since I'm way beyond trying to convince you to do things my way, I will say this one thing. Drake's a really good guy and you both deserve someone good. Cheers. Cheers. Welcome, everybody, to our annual Christmas Eve Festhalle festivities! Yeah! ♪ It's the night before Christmas morning ♪ ♪ All of my family's fast asleep ♪ ♪ All at once without any warning ♪ ♪ I hear the sound of little feet ♪ ♪ Pitter-patter on the roof ♪ ♪ Who is there I wonder who ♪ ♪ Have a merry ♪ ♪ Christmas Day ♪ Yay, mommy! So cute. Oh, hey. Eeh. We have to tell you something. - Oh, okay. - Come. - Um... - Oh, all right. Bridget, you will never guess who just called us. - Who? - Rashida George. - The head of the network. - Okay. She's been watching you all week and she thinks it's time that we give you your very own show. What? Seriously? - My own show? - Well, I mean, our show. Eddie and I will produce it. But, yes, your own show. Ay, bendito. Really? Oh, thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Okay, so, uh, what else did she say? Oh, uh, it'll be mid-morning, following directly after, uh, Top Of The Morning. Yeah, and you get to choose your very own co-host. - A very Merry Christmas to you. - What? Anyone you want. Or go at it on your own. It's totally up to you. Wow, I just... I can't believe this. Thank you, both, so much for believing in me. Thank you. - What's not to believe? - Thank you. Wow. - Hey. - Hi. Well, hello. You're looking at the new face of the morning show following directly after yours. - Wait, really? - Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. - Wow! Congrats. - Thank you. To all of you. - Thank you. - Happy for you. Yeah... Well, now it's time for us to go get some of that Gluhwein, huh? Well, I think that's an excellent idea. Let's go. - See you later. - Congratulations again. So... So, looks like you're gonna have some morning competition, Kincaid. Well, I mean, it's not really competition if we're on the same team, though, right? - Yeah, guess not. - Hm. But I guess we're gonna have to find a way to work around each other, so we're gonna have to learn how to get along, huh? Yeah. I guess so. I promise I'll try my best if you finally allow me to take you on a proper date. Okay, fine. But I'm just so curious as to why you never asked me out before. So they don't bring me on to your show, they hire me for the nighttime news, then you see me at work sometimes and you never asked me out? Oh, so, uh, are you talking about in the hallways when you'd completely avoid me by looking the other way? Or the break room you'd escape from the second I came in? Oh, I know it must've been the, uh, office holiday party last year. You completely ignored me. And then to make matters worse, you were on a cell phone call when I approached you from the bar. So I'm at a loss of words. - Yeah. We.. Yes. - Hm. I was, I was pretty brutal, huh? Nah, it's... It's fine. - I mean, you didn't know me. - Yeah, that's right. But you know what's kind of funny? Because you're a lot like your hometown here. Real frozen on the outside, but, but all warm and cozy in the center. Well, speaking of hometowns... I should probably get you out of here. Yeah, we got a plane we need you to get on from Seattle, 7:00 p.m. sharp, so that we can get you home in time for midnight mass. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Yeah. We're gonna head out in my dad's SUV. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. You know... as much as I really don't wanna leave here, I just really wanna get back to my aunt. - I understand. - But... Hey, I mean, maybe next year you can bring me back and show me some of these summer activities that you love? Yeah, I'd really like that. Good, because... I really love this place and I really, I really like your family, too. I'm glad to hear that. Uh, you know what my mom says? Happy kids make a happy home? That's, that's the one. So sweet. So, uh, listen. There was just one last thing I wanted to show you here. - Oh, yeah? - Mm-hmm. ♪ Noel the angels ♪ Mm, so you saved the best for last.
