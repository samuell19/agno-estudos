[BIRDS CHIRPING] [RHYTHMIC MUSIC] [DOOR CREAKING] [RHYTHMIC MUSIC] [WHIZZING] [SCREAMING] [DOG BARKING] [UPBEAT MUSIC] [KEYS CLANKING] [INDISTINCT WHISPERING] [PEOPLE TALKING IN DISTANCE] [CHOIR MUSIC] Ready? [CHOIR MUSIC] This jury service has come just at the right time because it's a big decision, child, signing on the dotted line. It's no secret you were once very much in love. It's one of the reasons we were so keen to have you. You know, someone who had experience of life. But equally, it's why we're so concerned that you make the right decision. Now, the rector is keen that you go, you know, take this time and find resolution in this matter. Then, either recommit yourself and take your vows or-- Or don't come back to all. That's not what he said. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. [TENSE MUSIC] Sorry. Sorry. Excuse me. [TENSE MUSIC] Did you find it? Yeah. Sit down, son. [INAUDIBLE] nowhere else to go. You know, Pauline in the clinic, she gave me your number. That's all right. You did the right thing. [INAUDIBLE] for the young man, Maria. A [INAUDIBLE] and a nice cup of tea. So are you all right? Yeah, just [INAUDIBLE] First deal, yeah? [INAUDIBLE] on you. You'll be all right, son. God didn't save you from drowning just so he could pummel you to death on the beach, you know. So what's the problem? I got home last night to find this. Is a court summons for jury service. I must have missed it, the date to withdraw, because I was in the clinic when it came in. Why'd you want to withdraw? Well, he said in the early days, you should, you know, avoid stressful situations. - Nobody's died of it. - No. You're not getting divorced, eh, or buying a house. No. Those are stressful situations. This is jury service. It's a piece of piss, man. You don't think I should do it, do you? Of course you should do it. You're sober, aren't you? Yeah. A productive member of society. Yeah. Next question. [TENSE MUSIC] Gosh, your suit. Yes. Not just any suit. Your best suit. Yes. I thought it would help me get picked. You've been picked. No, no, no, I've been summoned. They still have to pick me. It explains it in there. This way, they'll look at me and hopefully see someone who's respectable, honest, somebody who's made a special effort, who takes his responsibility seriously, sees it for the honor that it is. What, being a juror? Sure. To stand in judgment over someone's destiny, justice in your hands, isn't that special? To do your citizen's duty. I thought it might be two weeks not having to think about selling pensions. Not often someone of my generation gets a chance to do something for his country. It makes me feel important. Well, if you're so keen, then, I change. What? Isn't it the defense that gets to choose which jurors stay or go? Yes. Is it? Yeah. So the defense want people who look like they'll acquit, right? Right now, you look like a pillar of disestablishment, an authoritarian. They'd be more likely to choose a beach bum, a liberal, than someone who forgives. I'll be downstairs. [TENSE MUSIC] [CROWD YELLING] REPORTER: The crowd starts today at the school boy accused of murdering his 15-year-old classmate, John Mayer. Police [INAUDIBLE] resources have been made available [INAUDIBLE] [CROWD YELLING] There you are. Door to door. I bet you've been looking forward to this, ain't you? Well, it's something different, isn't it? Nice to get out. All my life, I've wanted to do jury service, do my citizen's duty. Finally, the summons comes through the door, and who's it for? The wrong Davis. Looks like it's going to be a big one. [CROWD YELLING] I bet you'd get that. I bet you'd get a big, fat, juicy murder trial. I doubt it. What if you do? What it goes on for months? It won't. What if you get involved in some long running trial, eh? How am I going to cope? You'll be fine. See you later. Yeah. What's that? Just some dry cleaning. Do you want me to pick you up? No, I'll make my own way back. You're so beautiful. Come on, then. I love you. You know that. I'll see you later. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [CHANTING] What do we want? Justice. When do we want it? Now. What do we want? Justice. When do we want it? Now. What do we want? Justice. [POLICE SIRENS] [CROWD YELLING] You'll be all right. What, a temperature? Oh, Sandy, I'm just going into the court right now. Well, no, I understand. If you're sick, you're sick. The last thing we want is Joy coming down with something. Listen, can you hang on till lunchtime? I'll make a few calls. I'm sorry, ma'am, but mobiles are prohibited. Sorry, I've got to go. [FANTASTICAL MUSIC] [GENTLE MUSIC] [MAN YELLING INDISTINCTLY] All right, come on. Nice shoplifting trial over and done with by lunchtime. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [LAUGHTER] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Elsie Beamish. Elsie Beamish. ELSIE: Yes. Jeremy Crawford. Yes. Jessica Garland. [CROWD YELLING] [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] Warren Murray. Yeah. Jonathan Dunn. This way. Jonathan Dunn. [BANG] Jonathan Dunn? Yeah. I swear by Almighty God-- That I will faithfully try the defendant-- And to give a true verdict according to the evidence. The particulars of the offense are that on the 15th of May, the prisoner, Duvinder Singh, went to Mannings Heath and there killed his fellow pupil, John Mayer. The defendant is charged with murder. He has pleaded not guilty. Murderer. Liar. [INAUDIBLE] Any further disturbances and the public gallery will be cleared. [INDISTINCT WHISPERING] Jesus. Oh god. Mr. Lewis. MR. LEWIS: Thank you, my lord. Members of the jury, I appear on behalf of the crown with my junior, Miss Blake. The defendant is represented by my learned friend, Mr. Cording and his junior, Mr. Dujesey. May I begin by asking you to look again at the indictment. It's a very formal document, isn't it, written in brief legal language. Perhaps, with your permission, I can help fill in the blanks. On the 15th of May last year at 6:30 in the morning, the defendant, Duvinder Singh, rose at home. He packed his school bags. He went downstairs. He had breakfast. He said goodbye to his family. But then, instead of heading for school, he went in the opposite direction. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] He went along High Street, reaching his local temple, a Sikh temple. And there, he broke in. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] Was this for prayer, for quiet contemplation, or devotional thought? No. The crown contends it was all part of a long conceived, premeditated plan, a plan to collect an antique sword, a five pound, 36 inch weapon, which was kept in a cellar beneath the temple. A five pound sword, which was shortly to become a murder weapon. [SCREAMING] With the sword concealed, the defendant exited the temple, taking care to lock the doors behind him. He went back along the street, apparently in a state of distress, as witnessed by the driver of a union dairy's milk truck. From there, he went onto Mannings Heath, a large area of public heathland at the north. [DOG BARKING] Once on the heath, he removed the sword from its concealed position. He reached [INAUDIBLE] the northwest of the heath, and there, he lay in waiting. Why was he there? Why was he rushing so? The crown suggests it was because he knew that at that time every morning, the victim, John Mayer, would make his way to the school. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] Members of the jury, let me tell you about the victim, John Mayer. This was a 15-year-old boy, a kind, friendly, intelligent pupil who comes from a warm, tight-knit, loving family which enjoys great respect and popularity in the community, a popularity which the defendant, a known loner, almost certainly envied. Perhaps it was this deep seated envy that inspired the sheer ferocity of the attack in the first place, the evidence of which I regret I am obliged in due course to expose you to. Repeated slashes to the neck, arms, and shoulders. [YELLING] Deep cuts to the victim's hands and forearms. [YELLING] Bear witness to a brave resistance, but it was in vain. [YELLING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Finally, the defendant let the weapon drop, having first had the foresight to wipe the fingerprints clean. And then, he fled the scene of the crime. He ran across the heath, seemingly impervious to the amount of witnesses to his behavior. He exited the west gate, rushing out towards the canals. He reached the canals and lost no time in removing his school uniform, a uniform which the crown suggests carried the single most important evidence-- the victim's blood. He changed into his sports clothes, which he brought with him, and threw the evidence into the canal. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [SPLASH] Disturbed by approaching people, he turned and fled in the opposite direction. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] He went to a hairdresser. You're sure? MR. LEWIS: --instructing him to remove the hair he'd grown since birth. [BUZZING] From there, he went to Waterloo Station, presumably with the intention of leaving the country, but it was too late. He had already attracted the attention of the police. You will hear and you will learn, members of the jury, how Duvinder Singh planned this murder long in advance, right from the choice of weapon down to the disposal of the bloodstained school uniform. And you will hear evidence which confirms his unusually aggressive, violent nature. And when you have heard all of this, I am certain that you will reach the only reasonable conclusion. It is the crown's case that on the 15th of May last year, Duvinder Singh cruelly, horrifically, and premeditatedly murdered his schoolmate, John Mayer, in cold blood. My Lord, that concludes the opening for the prosecution. 2 o'clock, please. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] GEORGE CORDING: Your boy did very well. He kept his head up. He paid attention. He did everything I asked of him. Good start. Yes, and it can't have been easy. Hearing the opening statement is often very difficult. That's only one version of events. It must have seemed like everything was against you. Yes, certainly seemed that way to me. Well, not for long. In a few days, I start the case with the defense. - How's that going? - Very well. Obviously, we're focusing on the inadequate investigation by the police. There's one lead in particular that we're following. Yes, but it's not something we can talk about now. But our hopes are very high. What do you make of the jury? I don't know. What do you think? We're thrilled. It's a real mixed bag. Women, men, young, old, black, white. A real jury. A real London jury, not a bunch of "Daily Mail" readers from Tunbridge Wells, right? Right. Right. WOMAN [ON SPEAKER]: [INAUDIBLE] wishing to claim travel and other expenses [INAUDIBLE] is open each day between 9:00 and 3:30. [GROUP LAUGHING] Do you mind if I join you? There's nowhere else. Cornish pasty. It's all I could find. What have you got? Ham salad. Oh, nice. You must have had the last one. Well, what you think? I beg your pardon. The boy didn't do it. It's day one of the trial. We barely got to lunchtime and you're already asking me for a verdict? Perhaps you didn't hear the judge when he asked us not to discuss it. We have to talk about something, don't we? Do we? We're going to be stuck together for weeks. Let's find another subject. It was the priest, the one I saw you with this morning. His name is Father Gervaise Bligh. He is, or was, my supervisor at the seminary. It's where Catholic priests train. I know. You do? I worked a month a year up north. Domestic-- you know, cooking and cleaning. You're a Catholic? And you're a priest. No, Mrs. Beamish, I'm not a priest, nor at this moment do I ever think I will be. No, no. It's just for this afternoon, until I can find another child minder. one who doesn't have flu. Really? OK. No, I'd need you before that, anyway. Ruby, it's me. I need a favor. WOMAN [ON SPEAKER]: All jurors are advised the court reconvenes at 2 o'clock. [CARS HONKING] [THUD] - Sorry. You OK? Oh, yeah, fine. [INAUDIBLE] I'll give you a hand. You know, I heard once how much you can tell about people from the-- from the shopping. Really? Yeah. I mean, you see, looking at this stuff, you can see that health is important to you. You enjoy simple, unpretentious foods, are careful with money, but you enjoy the good things in life. You have no pets, you have, no kids, and you like to escape into a private world of dreams and fantasies. Come on. We're going to be late. Oh, wait. Oh. You forgot this. You all right? Yeah, I'm fine. OK, everyone, that's 2 o'clock. I suppose we'd better get back. Mark. Mark Waters. Now, wait. Wait, come back. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] My god. Everything all right? Yeah. Sorry. WOMAN [ON SPEAKER]: I call Jan Mikhail Kukos. I swear by Almighty God that the evidence I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Please give the court your full name. Jan Mikhail Kukos. JUDGE: And your occupation, Mr. Kukos? Milkman. Do speak up, please. Milkman. Thank you Mr. Kukos, you've worked at Union Dairies for 16 years. Is that correct? JAN KUKOS: Yes. You are by some margin their longest serving milkman. Last year, you were their employee of the year. Yes. Mr. Kukos, were you in High Street at 7:35 AM on the 15th of May? Yes, I was. And while there, did you see someone? JAN KUKOS: Yes, I saw a young boy. Was there anything you noticed about him? Yes. He was walking in an unusual manner. JUDGE: How? JAN KUKOS: Crouched over, his arm hunched as if he was hiding something. JUDGE: We now know, Mr. Kukos, he was, in fact, concealing a sword. Is there anything else that might describe him? His state of mind, for example. He was walking quickly. And his expression. Could you describe his expression? He looked angry, distressed. It wasn't until later that day that I heard what had happened, someone with a sword in that state of mind. Only then did I realize that I could have done something. Thank you, Mr. Kukos. Mr. Cording. Thank you, my lord. Alas, Mr. Kukos, unlike you, I am not a fit man. You notice the grimace on my face as I get to my feet. Even the very act of getting to my feet leaves me short of breath. Or maybe it's not that. Maybe I'm not short of breath. Maybe I'm just a little asthmatic. Or maybe I've just had a routine operation on my stomach. Or perhaps because I have just stubbed my toe on a piece of uneven paving. My point is, Mr. Kukos, it is impossible-- impossible-- to tell what my expression is, let alone its cause. And yet, you seem quite certain that the defendant was distressed. May it not be that he was in a hurry and he was simply breathless? And even if he was distressed, is it possible to detect what he was distressed about? No. I'm sure you'll agree, Mr. Kukos, that a person in distress because they're unsure whether they are doing the right thing is a totally different proposition to someone distressed by murderous intent. Well, I suppose I-- Thank you. No further questions. 10 o'clock tomorrow, please. WOMAN: All rise. [INAUDIBLE] scum. You bastard [INAUDIBLE] You look out. [YELLING] You filthy scum. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [CROWD YELLING] You call this justice? My brother's dead. [CROWD YELLING] Hello. What a lovely surprise. I thought I'd give it half an hour. If you came out in that time, fine. If not, I've have had to choose the wine myself. Wine? Who for? My parents. Remember, they're coming for dinner. Oh no. I know. I tried to put them off. It's my first day. Now, instead of telling you all about it, I'll be counting the minutes until they leave. Maybe this time, it'll be different. No, no. It'll never be different, until I stop being Jewish and he stops being a snob. [KNOCKING ON WINDOW] - Move along. Double yellow line. - All right, come on. We're in the way. [CROWD YELLING] Joy. Mommy. - Joy, what are you doing? - [INAUDIBLE] Where's Gran? Over there. [CROWD YELLING] Are you crazy? She was playing in the street. Relax. I was just getting a light. Oh, what, so you can kill her as well as killing herself? Here's 20. That's all right. No, take it. It's better to do these things properly. All right, well, is that it, then? She eats at 5:00. It's been nice seeing you. And you. What are you doing tomorrow? Oh, we'll be fine. I'm sure the babysitter will be ready. I could do it, if you like. No, it will be fine. Thanks. All right. Grandma. Goodbye. [GENTLE MUSIC] Hello, yes. I'm looking for Isobel Fitzsimons. F-I-T. She used to work for you. You don't. Really? OK, thanks. [GENTLE MUSIC] I knew it. [GENTLE MUSIC] [SCRAPING] So how was it? OK. OK. Is that it? We're not allowed to talk about it. Says who? The judge. They're really strict about it. What, and even to your husband? No. Not even what the trial is? Not even a clue? I mean, what is it? Is it a fraud, a burglary? Nothing. Nothing? No, nothing. Well, what are we supposed to talk about? I don't know. I'm going to go watch telly. What about the clearing up? I cooked. Rose, I've been working all day. So have I. [GENTLE MUSIC] I'm Johnnie. I'm an alcoholic. It's my first day out of rehab, and I've been summoned as a juror and I'm under trial. [APPLAUSE] [GENTLE MUSIC] God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. [GENTLE MUSIC] [TENSE MUSIC] HOTEL WORKER: The toilet's at the end of the corridor. You'll be sharing it with rooms three and four. You said you wanted cheap. This is it. The cheapest I've got. Personally, I wouldn't put my dog in it. I'll take it. [SHOWER RUNNING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Hi, dad. Hi, dad. Hi, boys. How did it go? Yeah, it was interesting. Very interesting. There's some food under the grill. - Great. - I made fish pie. Lovely. You all right? Fine. Yeah. Fine. [GENTLE MUSIC] Did-- did Peter tell you he's serving as a juror at the moment? A juror? Marion, you shouldn't have said that. You lucky so-and-so. What's the case? I'm sorry, I can't discuss it. Oh, come on, Peter. No, they were quite clear about this. You're not to discuss it with anyone. But you can say it's a murder. MRS. SEGAL: Oh, how wonderful. Marion. A 16-year-old schoolboy murdered by his Sikh classmate. It made headlines at the time because he's a minor and a Sikh and because he claims he's innocent. - Is he? - I don't know. Oh, come on. You must have an instinct. One always does. The minute one meets anyone, one makes judgments. Really, the judge was quite specific. But certainly the evidence is against him. A number of witnesses say him going there and leaving. [TENSE MUSIC] [APPLAUSE] Thank you. Thank you, all of you. Look around me. I see a lot of good friends here tonight [INAUDIBLE] family. I see a large extended family. Hello, son. I can tell you there's one member of that family missing today, my son. I know some of you will have lost loved ones. You know the pain of grief. You know its many faces. So you'll know why I've thanked God 100 times that I kissed my boy goodbye before he left that morning and told him that I loved him, just as I always tell these two lads here that I love him. They're not even my boys. So I'd like to say thank you to all of you for your kindness and your support. I hope I can repay that kindness in the future. [SOLEMN MUSIC] [WHISPERING] People everywhere were coming up to us. They want to help, Dad. They're waiting for the nod. No. People are watching us like hawks. One sniff of trouble, they'll abandon the trial. We'll have to wait another two years to get justice. So what you're saying-- I'm saying trust the process. Oh, come on. You were there that day. You heard the evidence. There isn't a jury on earth that wouldn't convict that scum. So? So trust the process. And then, when he's banged up inside, that's where we'll reach him. What about the jurors? We'll lean on them. You do nothing. You understand me? Nothing. He's gone soft. I can't wait that long. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [GENTLE MUSIC]
