Hell is coming for breakfast. [thudding] Hey, little lady. Hell is coming for breakfast. I got it. You've been saying that for the last forever, Joe. Am I supposed to pretend I can't hear? -[light clicks] -[Joe] It's Clint. [Tess groans] I'm sleeping. [Tess groans] So, is it the actual location that's coming for breakfast or is hell actually coming for breakfast? Like, is it like, "Get ready, little lady, Friars Club is coming for breakfast." Or is it, "Hey, little lady, Walmart is coming for breakfast, because I need to know how many places to set." You think you're funny, don't you? -[Tess chuckles] What is that? -Oh, you mean this? Well, who's coming for breakfast? Satan? Hitler? [Joe] You love it. No, please go back to the bathroom, shave it off. Not shaving it off. It's authentic. -It's my hunting look. -[Tess] Oh. Yeah. -[Tess] Hey, baby. -Hmm? Authentic is how you walked into this town. It looks good on me. It does look good. -That's right. -[Tess] It does. [Joe] Now, hold on, hold on, hold on. -Oh, wow. -Hold on, hold on. [Joe clicks tongue] Honey, why don't you hop back into bed? Come on. I'll do this authentic guy. Come on. Come on. I mean it. Honey, come on, don't be-- [Joe] Making fun of me. It's fine. I mean so... -[Tess groans] -[door slams shut] -[Tess groans] -[fridge door opens] All right, let's have it. -This is irresponsible. -You said that last night. [Tess sighs] That's just stupid, what you're doing. -You said that too. -Well, you're being an asshole. Tess, why are you blowing this out of proportion? Tons of guys around here hunt for their livelihood. Your dad does it, Doug does it. Uh, you're not from here, Joe. You sell insurance for a living and you're really good at it. Okay, well, I live here now, so what? And you're understanding of here thus far is that mustache? You haven't hunted enough with Doug to go out on your own. I keep telling you I have a funny feeling about this and you just keep ignoring that. That was mean. Yeah, it was. I'm sorry. We moved out here to provide our boys with a safe, familiar place to grow up and not to become some... end of the world Fox News people. That's not what's happening. It's not what's happening, Tess. You have nothing to prove. I love you... without the mustache. But there are a couple of girls I can whore you out to if you want it. If things get worse, we need to know how to do this stuff. [Tess chuckles darkly] [Tess] Not that argument again. No, why can't-- why can't I say that? -Why can't I say that? -Because-- Because I heard it my whole life. Okay? I grew up with these mountains and my-- my dad prepping for the end of days. -That's why I left. -This is stupid. -I can't win this argument. -Oh, you can't? You know why? Because it's not about providing, it's about your ego, it's about you wanting to go out with the boys hunting. So what? So what? There's nothing wrong with that except for experience you don't have. -That's why I'm going out. -With someone else, Joe. That's how you learn. You don't learn alone. No, you learn by going out there and doing it. Right, you just go sit in the deer stand, you wait for a deer, and you shoot it. Twelve-year-old boys do it. Why can't I go out there and try it? We agreed that we would learn together as a family. We would grow a garden in the spring and can in the winter. Go with Doug next week. That is all I'm asking. It's not much. I packed lunch for the entire day. And I'm going to go out there and I'm gonna stay all day. And I will not be home until tonight. [Tess] Okay. And if you kill something, you know how to disembowel it, right? Babe, I can't-- I can't. I'm not doing this. [lips smacking] -I love you. -I love you. You better say goodbye to the boys. -No doubt they heard us. -[Joe sighs] [footsteps approaching] [Joe] Love you, buddy. [son] Hey, little lady, hell's for breakfast. [Joe chuckles] You like that? Mm-hmm. Will you say it for me? [whispering] That's why I'm coming in. To tell you I love you and I'll see you tonight. Okay. You and Mom fighting? No, not at all. You're doing that whisper thing again. [Joe sighs] -[son vocalizes] -Well, sometimes when Mom and Dads need to have a conversation, it's better that it happens in whispers. -You like it? -Mm-hm. It looks funny. I love you. -I'll see you tonight. -[son] Me too. [lips smacking] [crickets chirping] Hey. [knocking on glass] Last offer. Don't do this. Don't do that. Don't. [Joe chuckles] -What are you doing? -Come on. [Joe sighs] What are you doing? Okay, then. Have fun out there. You know what I'll be doing. [owl hooting] [Joe sighs] What's wrong with you, Joe? Get a gun, go out, kill a deer just to go... [car door clicks] [car door shuts] [car engine rumbling] [gravel churning] [tires screeching] [engine stops] [cabin door clicks] [paper rustling] [cabin door shuts] -[Joe] Good morning. -[Doug] Good morning. Hey. [Joe clears throat] Can I borrow your-- your rifle? [Doug] You ain't get one yet? Tess, she, uh-- she doesn't want to get one right now. It-- it doesn't matter. Can I just borrow yours? [door shuts] [door creaking] [Joe] Ah. -Do you need ammo? -[Joe] No, I bought some. -Tess let you get ammo? -She doesn't know I bought it. -[Doug] Mmm. -Sorry, sorry. -[Doug] Got your tags? -Got them in the bag. -[Doug] You double check 'em? -Yes, Mom. I ain't your mom. All right, I know. [Doug] Won't be a problem on the property. No one can be on it. But if an officer asks for your tags on the way back and you don't have them, that's trouble. I got it. Got it. [Doug] You remember how to get to the property? -I believe so. -[Doug] What else? I-- I can't think of anything else. If you just wait 'til next week, I can go. [Joe] Thank you. But I've got two conferences next week. -Plus, Tess-- -No, I ain't in your marriage. Unless you into some freaky stuff. Keep it to yourself, then. Look, keys are in the car if you need to borrow it for any reason, have at it. I ain't driving that jerk mobile. That's nice. [car door clicks] [car door shuts] -Thanks again. -[Doug] Mm-hm. Hey, I'll be sure to bring that ten point by here so you can get that photo op. [Doug] Godspeed. [car door shuts] [car engine revving] [metal music blaring] [Doug laughs] -[engine stops] -[dog barks] That's your music, right? [Joe] You know, you've got neighbors.
