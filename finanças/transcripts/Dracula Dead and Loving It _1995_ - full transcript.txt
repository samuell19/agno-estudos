I love this palace of art and beauty. Oh, yes, my dear. The opera is astonishing. The music is fraught with love, Hate, sensuality, And unbridled passion... All the things in my life I've managed to suppress. Sorry i'm late, my dear. We were worried, father. Mmm. I'm sorry. Sit, sit, sit, sit. I was detained at my asylum. The most extraordinary lunatic was brought in today. He was the only man found alive On that schooner that drifted into whitby harbor. Absolutely be-Zarre. Hello. Can i help you, sir? Yes, you may help me. Dr. Seward is in the next box. It is imperative That i meet with him alone. You will tell him There is a message for him in the lobby. A message for dr. Seward In the lobby. Good. Now go. Message in the lobby For dr. Seward. And you will remember nothing Of what i tell you. Extraordinary. Hello. Can i help you, sir? Can i help you, sir? What is the matter with you? Why did you not tell him? About what? About the message. For whom? Never mind! I will tell him myself. And for your miserable performance, You will receive no tip. No tip?! Oh! Th you remember. Oh, look who's singing here. Excuse me. Are you the dr. Seward Whose sanitarium is in whitby? Why, yes. I have just purchased carfax abbey, And i understand it adjoins your grounds.

This is lucy westenra, And this is my fiancee, dr. Seward's daughter, mina. Count dracula. It will be a relief to see lights burning Through those dismal windows Of carfax abbey once again. Lucy: oh, yes! The abbey always reminds me of that old toast. You know... Lofty timbers, The walls around are bare, Echoing to our laughter, As though the dead were there. I like the way you think, my dear. Death is one of my favorite subjects. We must get together and have a long discussion. Very long. And now i take my leave. I have a pressing appointment. Count dracula? I am sorry, my dear, but you have... Such a lovely ucipital mapillary. What's that? This. Oh. Thank you. And now, i take my leave. There's something... Otherworldly about that man. He gives me the shivers. Oh, yes... Me, too. Lucy: oh, count dracula... Wish we could have that long, long talk... Right now. Aah! Mmm. Oh, excuse us, my dear. Oh, dr. Seward. Jonathan! Um, i was sleeping. Yes, uh, we're sorry, dear, But we heard a noise in the bushes below your window. We thought perhaps it might be a prowler. Yes. Would you mind terribly if we had a look about? Oh, no, please do. Well, nothing out here. Nothing amiss here, either. Ah, what a relief. I'm very confident there's no danger here whatsoever. Sorry to disturb you, dear. We've searched every inch of the room, And there's no sign of forcible entry. Good night. Huh. Something wrong with this latch. Not to worry. I'll give it a jolly good slam! Ohh! Ohh! Renfield: master! Renfield! Yes? I can't take it. Can you take it? The lights, the screaming, The crazy faces staring at me. I tell you, the walls are closing in on me. I've got to get out of here! Guard! Get back to work! Yes, sir! Come along then, renfield. You're going to have tea with the governor. At last. Now you'll see, martin. Dr. Seward will believe i'm not insane. I wouldn't bet me last shilling on it. Let's go. Stay. Dr. Seward? Yes? Mr. Renfield is here. Oh, good. Send him up, martin. Oh, mcmanus, The patient in the west wing? Seward: yes? He's having a conniption fit. Oh. Give him an enema. An enema? Yes. It'll give him a feeling of accomplishment. Yes, sir. Oh, renfield. Good of you to come. Nice to see you, old chap. How are we feeling today? Normal. Perfectly normal. Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. Dr. Seward, may i ask why i've been brought to the sanitarium? Oh, we would just like to perform a few tests, that's all. If you don't mind? No. Not at all. As you can see, I'm quite all right now. Quite so. Quite so. Oh, hungry? Famished. Help yourself. Yes, such a bounty. Yes. I was just telling mar... What was that? What? You just grabbed something from the table. I did not. Yes, you did. I saw you. You put it in your mouth. I think it was an insect. Oh, that was a raspberry. Raspberry? We're not serving raspberries. It must have been a raisin. Yes, it fell off the muffin. There. Seems to be one missing. It's missing. A raisin, of course. Yes... How extraordinary. How silly of me. Must've been my imagination... There. You did it again. Renfield: what? You...you...you just put a bug in your mouth. I...i...i think it was a spider. I did not. Yes, you did. I did not. I tell you I saw you snatch a spider Right out of the air and eat it! A spider? How absurd. Seward: huh. What? Oh. Dropped my fork. Dropped it? You flung it. What's the matter with you? I don't under... Mr. Renfield, what are you doing down there? What... what are you... Renfield: fork found! This is most unseemly. I don't think i... Sorry for the delay. My god, man. You're eating insects right from the ground. What makes you say that? Because i can see one trying to get out of your mouth! Out of my mouth? Yes, out of your mouth. Your very own mouth. It's wriggling about! Don't be ridiculous. Wriggling? I'm not ridiculous at all! It's wriggling all over the place! Poor thing is fighting for its life! I don't know what you're talking about. If you insist on ranting like this, I'm going to leave. Me ranting? You're the ranter! Hello, little darling. Don't be afraid. Ha ha ha! Oh, he's cracking. I won't hurt you. All i want is your life! No! Martin! Ha ha ha! Put him in a straitjacket And give him an enema. Wait! Give him an enema first. Then put him in a straitjacket. Yes, sir. Lives! Lives! Oh, lucy, you lazy girl. It's past 10:00. The horses are saddled and waiting. Ohh. Mina, i don't think i could put a foot Out of bed today. Had such horrid dreams. I feel completely drained. Darling, you're dreadfully pale. You look absolutely peaked. Perhaps father should have a look at you? Yes, perhaps. Ohh. Ohh. Father... yes? It's lucy. What's the matter with her? Well, i don't know. She's frightfully pale and wan. Pale? Wan?I'd best have a look. Ohh. I've given you some laudanum, dear. It'll help you sleep. I see no sign of infection. Are you sure you don't remember Where these marks came from? Jonathan: an insect? Perhaps a spider? Do you recall being bitten? No. But i had a dream. Oh, yes? What about that dream? I remember nothing. She's asleep. I must confess, i'm completely confounded. I'm going to take the liberty Of contacting professor abraham van helsing. Van helsing? I thought he was some sort of metaphysician and philosopher? He's also a medical doctor, Knows more about obscure diseases Than anyone in the world. He may be the only man who can help us. Oh, yes. Contact him, father. Contact him straightaway. Yes. Van helsing, germanic accent: gentlemen, You are about to observe your first autopsy. It is not unusual For some members of the freshmen class To feel a bit faint during this procedure. So this is where we begin to separate Our future physicians From those who just want to play doctor. Now, first things first. We uncover the corpse. Ohh! We make an incision from the groin... To the upper chest cavity. Ohh! There. Ohh! Now, as i open the abdominal wall, You will observe that the organs have gone From a nice, healthy pink To a disgusting green. Ohh! Ohh! We must check the intestines for pathological clues. So... Ah! Here! Pass it along. Don't worry. There's plenty to go around. Ohh! Well... No one seems to be standing. Hello! I'm still standing, professor van helsing. Hm! Ah, woodbridge, right? Mm-Hmm. Come closer, woodbridge. Good for you. Stout fellow. Why don't we have a look at the brain? Huh? Mm-Hmm. First, we crack open the skull. So... Behold the naked human brain. Examine it. Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Ohh! So, a good morning's work. Come! Oh, professor. 10 out of 10. Ja. I still got it! Well, i have a message for you from dr. Seward. A message from dr. Seward? What does he say? He wants you to come to whitby immediately. It's an emergency. An emerrrrrgency? Mm-Hmm. Yes, sir. An emerrrrrgency. Hmm. I am awake. I am awake during the daytime? What is happening? I cannot be up during the daylight. Ah. It must be the young blood from miss lucy. Her blood is still in my system. Is it possible she has cured me? Yes! I am cured. Now i can be up night and day! It is so bright. So many colors. And the sun is so warm! Hello, young lovers. I could not help but smell your lovely picnic. Could i presume to ask you for a piece of your chicken? Surely, sir. Some wine, sir? I never drink...wine. Oh, what the hell. Let me try it. Ahh. It's good! Master! Master! Renfield, look at me. I'm drinking wine and eating chicken. Master, what are you doing out in the daytime? Relax, renfield. I am cured! No. No, you're not. Look. Ohh! I...made...a mistake. I've got to get back to my coffin. It's nighttime. It wasn't real. I was having a daymare. Hmm. 3 tiny puncture marks on her throat. 3? 2. 2 tiny puncture marks on her throat. What does it mean, professor? Gentlemen... What i am about to say Will shake the very foundation Of every medical precept you hold dear. We have entered the realm Of the supernatural. The supernatural? Realm of the supernatural? Ja! Lucy has been attacked By a creature that rises from its grave And sucks the blood of the living In order to prolong its own unholy existence. What we are dealing with here is... A vampire! Vampire? Vampire? What are you saying? I'm saying, "vampire." But, professor,modern sciencedoes not admit To such a fanciful creature. Modern science, pish posh. She has lost a great deal of blood, ja? Ja. Well, look. Look. Where did all the blood go? Look at the sheet, the pillowcase, Her nightgown. Do you see anything? How does your modern science explain zhat? Can you explain zhat? I can't explain zhat. No one can explain zhat! Are you asking us to believe That some creature just flew in Through that window, bit lucy on the neck, And drank of her blood? Exactly. And tonight, The foul thing will return. It will sup on her life's fluid Until it has drained her Of every last drop. Van helsing: and if she dies A victim of this unspeakable creature, She will become one herself. What? What? She will become one herself. What can we do to protect her from this fiend? Seward! Yes? Do you have any books on the occult? They're right here. Do you have transylvanian folklore? No. Do you have the theory and the theology Of the evil undead? No. Do you have the vampires of prague? No! Do you have nosferatu? Yes, we have nosferatu. We have nosferatu today. It just came in the post. Ah. Here, give it. Here. Ja. Ja. Ja. Here! There is a way to protect her. How? "The creature is repelled by garlic. "Its purifying effect is anathema To the tainted soul of the vampire." Oh! Ohh. I must move the coffin Or the chandelier. We've brought you down here So you'll be closer to us, my dear. Seward: we'll be just down the hall in the study. You must get a good night's rest To regain your strength, my dear. It's the only way to improve your health. Would an enema help? Come, come. We must go. Sleep well, miss lucy. The garlic will protect you. Ohh. Whoooo! Garlic! Blah! Renfield. Renfield. Master? It is time for you to serve your master. Come. Yes, master. Those meddling idiots. They want to prevent me From entering miss lucy's bedroom. I want to take... W-Wai...uh, wait, master. All right. I'm listening. They have placed garlands of garlic Around her room. What can i do, master? I can't leave this cell. Do you imagine i could not take you out of here if i wish... That these pathetic bars could stop me? Wait, master. I'm getting such a headache. How dare they try to match wits with me? Me, who has commanded the forces of darkness. Me, who has called forth the demons of the night To do my bidding. Me, who has destroyed every enemy Down through the centuries. Waaah! Renfield, i'm talking to you. Sorry, master. Come. We have much to do and less time to do it in. Renfield, hurry. Uhh...unh! Renfield, i meant for you To use the drainpipe. I fly. You don't. Oh, yes, of course. Come. He flies. I don't. Ohh... Heh...heh...heh...heh. Aah! Aah! Aah! Renfield, you idiot. Grab him, harker! Aah! I am weak! I am weak! I strayed! What did he do? I caught him lifting up the sheets And looking at me! Ugh! Nothing but a filthy pervert, eh? Martin! There you are! Take him back to his cell And give him a you-Know-What. No! No! Not another enema! Yes, another and another! Until you come to your senses! I'll close the window. Yes, yes. Good lad. Are you all right, dear? Oh, yes, i'm fine, dr. Seward, Apart from this ghastly garlic. I'm sorry, dear, but van helsing insists. Ohh, lord! Lucy... I command you... Open the window. Come! Get in there, you stupid degenerate! I didn't see anything! I didn't see anything! I saw everything. Aah! It's lucy. Someone was attacking her! Wait here. How is she? She's dead. Dead? The vampire has taken all of her blood. I told her not to leave the safety of the garlic. No! No, no, no! It's absolutely absurd. I tell you, we must drive a wooden stake through her heart, Or else she will rise from her grave To seek the blood of the living! Lucy was my ward. I won't permit you to desecrate her body In such a vile manner. It's... it's sacrilegious. But dr. Seward, shouldn't we at least Stand guard over lucy's grave, just to make sure? No. I'm having serious doubts about this whole vampire theory. For heaven's sake, who in all of england, By the very furthest stretch of the imagination, Could possibly be a vampire? Count dracula. Well, maybe him. Ahem. What? Hoo hoo. What are you hoo-Hooing about? Oh! Oh, count dracula. We were just talking about you. Favorably, of course. Forgive my interruption, but i was just made aware Of the unfortunate passing of miss lucy. I wish to offer my condolences. Thank you. We're all very distraught. Yes. Oh, count dracula, Allow me to introduce professor abraham van helsing Of london university. He's a doctor of rare diseases, As well as theology and philosophy. And gynecology. Oh, i didn't know you had your hand in that, too. Van helsing... a name we know Even in the wilds of transylvania. Count dracula. Hmm, curious. Are you descended from vlad tepes, The first dracula? Tepes? Ja. It means "the impaler." He was a bloodthirsty butcher Who inflicted unspeakable tortures on the peasants, Cutting off their hands and feet, Gouging out their eyes, And then impaling them on iron spikes. They had it coming. Uhh! What could they possibly have done To deserve such barbaric and inhuman treatment? Yes. We have a saying in the old country. They also said... I'm very impressed, van helsing. You speak the ancient moldavian. Well, gentlemen, i will take my... ...leave. I see, van helsing, you are a man Who likes to have the last word. I will not be drawn into such a childish exercise. Ha ha! It is immaterial to me Who has the last word. It is getting late. We'll carry on this conversation at another time. Good night. Such arrogance. Heh. It is easy to see why the decadent aristocracy Is dying out in that part of the world. Gentlemen, our work is not done. The vampire is still among us. You must remember, he is cunning. He has the wisdom of centuries. And above all, he will never give up. Ugh! That man! He never gives up! Never gives up. Harker: what are you thinking, professor? When did count dracula move in? About a month ago. And when did miss lucy's symptoms first appear? About the same time. Are you saying that count dracula is our vampire? Yes! And no. Then what are you saying? I'm saying no... But i'm leaning towards yes. Then you're saying yes. No. Then it's no. Not necessarily. You sound dubious. No, i'm positive. Of what? My theory! And that would be? The theory of yes... Or no. Good night, sweet lady. May angels' voices sing thee to thy rest. Lucy: help me. What's that? Lucy: help me. It's so dark in here. Who's in there? I'm alive. They've buried me alive. Saints preserve us. Don't worry, miss. I'm comin'. Oh, my god. They made a mistake, A...a terrible mistake. Oh, please help me. I'm so very cold. You'll be all right. You're alive. Aah! I say, jonathan, What are you doing? Just for tonight, I'm going to stand guard at lucy's grave, As the professor suggested. Surely you don't believe this vampire business. Oh, i don't know what i believe. But on the odd chance that van helsing is right, I should never forgive myself If i didn't make sure. All right, all right. Go ahead. Go ahead. But i think you're wasting your time. Heh. Poppycock. Aah! Gott in himmel! Lucy, singsong: jonathan... Lucy: jonathan... Lucy? Oh, come away with me, jonathan. I know you've always wanted me... And i've always wanted you. Finally, we can be together. But, lucy, i'm engaged to mina. And you're dead. I'm not dead. I'm undead. Yes, well, i'm not unengaged. Thank you. Jonathan, let me kiss you. Let me show you the deep, raw passion Of unbridled sexual frenzy. Uh, but, lucy... I'm british. But so are these! Lucy! Uh huh huh huh! Uhh! Now we can be together, Forever. Van helsing: back! Back, unholy demon of the night. After her! This is our chance! For what? To destroy her, my boy. She's retreated to her crypt. Come! My god. Now she's dead. No, she's not. She's alive? She's nosferatu. She's italian? No. It means "the undead." She's cursed to spend eternity in misery, Hunting the living like a wild animal. What should we do? For the sake of her eternal soul, We must destroy her. The only way is to drive a wooden stake... Through her heart! Oh, that's horrible. Is there no other way? One other. We could cut off her head, Stuff her mouth with garlic, And tear off her ears. Give me the stake. Ok. Oh, no. No, i can't do it. You...you do it. It must be done by one who loved her in life. I only liked her. Close enough. Here. Good boy. All right. You can do it. You can do it. Here. Now place the point of the stake Directly over her heart. Right. And hit as hard as you can. Wait! Now! Ohh, my...god! There's so much blood! She just ate! Uhh! She's still alive. Hit her again! No, no. I can't. How much blood can she have left? Ohh... Go. Uh huh huh. Uh huh. Uhh... She's almost dead. She's dead enough. Ohh. Oh, this is... this is ghastly. Yes, you're right. We should have put newspapers down. Ohh. Oh, what have i done? What have i done to poor lucy? You have released her, my boy. Now she sleeps in peace... Forever. Here. Here. Clean yourself up. Thank you. Oh, poor lucy. Poor, poor lucy. Oh. Here. Keep it. Essie... Your eyelids are growing heavy. You will sleep. Sleep. Mina... Mina, open your eyes. Arise, mina. Walk to the door. Mina, you are in the closet. Open the door... And come out. Now walk to the terrace door. Watch out for the foot... Stool. Stand up. Not you. Sit. No, not you. You sit. You stand. No, sit. No, you stand. You walk to the terrace door, And you go back to sleep. Watch out! Ohh! Wait. I'm coming. Turn out the lights So no one will see me. You will be my bride throughout eternity. We'll share the endless passion of immortal love. Oh, i can't wait! Not you! You will be my bride throughout eternity. We'll share the endless passion of immortal love. Van helsing: oh, my boy. Such a night. Oh, such a night! Oh! My god, man! What's happened to you? Everything. Professor van helsing was absolutely right. Lucy rose from her grave and attacked me. And now... At last... She sleeps in peace. You mean lucy actually became a vampire? Yes. Ja. Where's mina? Oh, she's all right, fast asleep. Essie is sitting watch over her. Good. I'll just sit watch myself In front of her door, then. Uh, uh, don't you think you ought to Get cleaned up first, old boy? Oh, yes, quite right. Uh, do you mind using the servants' entrance? There's a good chap. I don't understand it. He's covered with blood, And there's not a drop on you. Why? I have been to many, many stakings. You have to know where to stand. You know, everything in life Is location, location, location. And now we shall do the dance of love. Ah! You're good! Hey, stop it! Oh, no hickeys! Oh! Oh! Ohh! Mina? Ohh! Oh...jonathan! Shh! Shouldn't we rouse her? Yes, perhaps you're right. Essie? Oh! Oh, i must've dropped off. Good gracious! It's morning! One moment, i was on guard wide awake, And the next, i felt like... A dark cloud came over me. Are you all right? Oh, fine. Here we are, then, safe and sound. It's getting on. I best see to breakfast. Ow! Where'd that come from? Heh heh heh! Jonathan, i had The most extraordinary dreams last night. I feel so...different. You... look different, mina. Ohh. Come. Sit with me. Closer. Ahem. Closer, you silly boy! Darling, we know each other so well, And yet we've never really... Explored each other. Thank god. Jonathan, i've changed. I'm not the mina you knew. What do you mean, dearest? I want you to do something for me, Something that i have never asked you before. Of course, my dear. Anything. Good. Touch this. Don't mind if i d...hey! Mina! What are you saying?! All right, you don't have to touch anything. I'll touch you. No! Mina...stop this immediately! What's come over you? I'm leaving. No, please don't go! You're right. You're right. Something is wrong with me, And it's...it's taking over my mind And forcing me to say things i would never say And do things i would never do. Jonathan, please help me. Please help me! Oh, mina, mina, yes. Anything! What can i do? Touch this! Oh! Good morning, mina! How did you slee...harker! Oh, oh... Jonathan, take your hands off me! Yes, yes, take your hands off her! Uh, uh, sorry, sir. You should be ashamed of yourself! But she made me do it. Is that right, mina? No, father. Suddenly, without any reason at all, He laid his hands on me. Ooh, she told me to touch it! Harker, you're a degenerate! I take you into my home, You eat my food, you drink my wine, But that's not enough for you! Oh, no! After being engaged to my daughter for only 5 years, You have the audacity to...touch her! Get out! But, sir... out, i say. What is happening here? Terrible doings! Found young harker here with his hands all over my daughter. But she forced me to, sir. She's been behaving rather strangely. It's as through she's been under some sort of a...spell. Spell? That's a very lovely scarf you're wearing, miss mina. Oh! Yes, i felt chilly this morning. Hmm. Excuse me. May i have...a look? Just as i thought! Like... like lucy! Oh, no, it's nothing! I accidentally did it while i was pinning a shawl. Oh, really? I have something for you, miss mina. A present? Sort of. Hold out your hand. Here. Aah! Mina! Here. Look! What is that? It is proof, my unfortunate friend, That your daughter has been corrupted By the evil of a vampire. We must find this vampire Before mina meets the same fate as lucy! But who is the vampire? Van helsing suspects count dracula. It could also be renfield. The man drinks the blood of insects And bent the bars of his cell like they were cheese. It could be anyone. There is a way, An indisputable way, To reveal the vampire. I'm going along with you on this, van helsing, But i think this ball is in extremely bad taste. Lucy dead less than a fortnight And mina's health hanging in the balance. The ball's been in progress for over an hour. It appears as if count dracula isn't coming. I hope you're wrong, my boy. I especially wanted to see count dracula tonight. I wonder if he suspects something, Good evening. All: aah! Did i startle you? No! No, no, no! No! Not at all! It's quite all right! Servant: may i take your cape, sir? No, not my cape. You may take my hat. Thank you. Yes, we were afraid You wouldn't show up. I would not miss your gala. I always keep my nights open For new experiences. Ah! Miss mina looks especially lovely tonight. Would you be insanely jealous If i should ask her to dance? Well, to be perfectly frank... Not at all. Thank you. Ow. Psst! Master, you're here! You're here... shh! Do not call me "master." What are you doing here? I don't know. They invited me. I smell a rat. Where? Renfield! If i am discovered, we must flee. Yes. I'll escape. I'll meet you at carfax... No. That would be too dangerous. They will search there first. I have moved my coffin to the abandoned chapel At the top of the cliffs. When you come, make sure you're not being followed. Do you understand? Yes, master. Do not call me "master!" Yes, ma...mmm! Man: yes, splendid! Bravo! Good evening, miss mina. May i have the next dance? I beg your pardon, sir. Can't you see i'm having a drink with miss mina? You have finished your drink. So i have. Come, miss mina. Martin! Right! Van helsing: now! Huh? Seward: i can't see him! H-How can this be? The vampire casts no reflection In a mirror. She's doing quite well without him, isn't she? Oh, look! Look in the mirror! Do you see that? Hey, we must be good! Let's really give them something to watch! Play the czardas! Czardas! Guests: oh! Huh?! Ohh! They're loving it! Oh! Come on! Big finish! Guests: oh! You are a very wise man, van helsing, For someone who has yet to live A single lifetime! Ohh! Ohh! Mina! Get him! Master! Master! I mean, mister! Mister! Give it up, you! Aah! Where do you think you're going? Professor! We must find them before sunrise! Why before sunrise? Because the rays of the sun will destroy him. He must hide during the daylight hours. Come, or miss mina will be lost to us forever. Come. Come along, old fly-Eater. We've searched carfax abbey from top to bottom. There's no trace of him. What can we do, professor? Where could he be? I don't know. Renfield. We must release renfield. He is our only hope. He called dracula master! I thought he said, "mister." That was only a ruse To fool the feeble-Minded. No offense. I understand. Renfield will go straight to dracula. Ja. And we will follow. This way. You'll stay here till you rot. Aah! Well, you're free to go. Free to go? Why? How? Good behavior. But i've only been in here for a moment. Well, for that moment, Your behavior was very good. Ohh. Let's go. Watch your step. I'm coming, master! Uh uhn. I know what they're up to. They think i'll lead them to the master. I must outsmart them. Lost 'em. Gentlemen, we are fortunate. Why? He's an imbecile. Come. Ha ha ha ha! Master, i'm here! Renfield. Are you sure you were not followed here? No. I led them in the wrong direction. They have no idea where i am. Seward: he went into the chapel! Hurry! You have led them right to me, You stupid nincompoop. I didn't know! I'm sorry, master. Punish me! No. No, go. Lead them away. I don't have any time. No! You must punish me! Hurt me! I deserve it! Not now! But i failed you, master! I'm a useless, pitiful fool Who has betrayed you! You must hurt me! All right! Good, master. Good. Good. Ok. That's enough. Aah! Eee! Aii! Oww! Ooh! Why? Up there! Ohh! Aii! Nnnn ooh! Unh! It's locked! We must break it open! Put your weight into it. Doctor. Count. Good, good. Van helsing: put your weight into it! They are too late. Soon you will be my bride for eternity. Good. Keep it up! Harder! Van helsing: the hinge is on its way! Ein! Zwei! Drei! Aah! Ohh! Jonathan, duck! Oof! Aah! Back! Aah! Jonathan, get that stake! A sharp wooden stick! Anything! Back! Good! Good. Now drive it through his heart! Uh-Oh! Arrggh! Van helsing: look out! Ha ha ha ha! Arrogant mortal. You are in my world now, And you will never leave this attic alive. I will destroy you, And then i will possess she whom you love the most. And there is not a single thing in the world You can do to stop me. Ha ha ha... Ow! Aah! For that, you will watch While with your beloved mina, I consummate our marriage. Aah! Ow! Oww! Aah! Ooh ooh! Aah! Grab him! He's getting away! Grab him! Where is he? Where did he go? Jonathan: he's up there. We must catch him, Or else all is lost. Master. This way! Aah! Aah! Renfield, you asshole! Ohh. Oh! Where am i? What's happened to dracula? He's dead. Ja. And you're free. Oh, thank god. You're my own sweet, innocent mina again. Oh, and i have you, my darling jonathan, To thank for it. And now, my dearest... Let me take you home. Master. I'm sorry! Forgive me. There. You're starting to look like your old self again. Your master is gone forever, mr. Renfield. You are your own man now. I am? Yes. No one will ever control you again. You're right. Good. Come, renfield. Yes, master. Captioning made possible by warner bros.
