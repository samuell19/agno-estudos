Make up your mind. Bye. ﻿Well? -Sshhh. ﻿Don't shush me, I don't have all day. ﻿Quiet, Moshe. ﻿Oh my god! ﻿Does he want us to do it for him? ﻿Typical, this one never finishes what he starts. ﻿He works very hard, you should be so diligent. ﻿Yeah, right... At his age I already had a house and two kids. ﻿Keep going, sweetheart, we're not here. ﻿Stop it, you two. You wanna jinx him, or what? ﻿You okay? ﻿What? ﻿Yeah, I'll go in again after him. ﻿In and out. ﻿Shooting blanks? ﻿First time. ﻿No, everything's fine. ﻿Yeah, nice and easy. ﻿You'll get used to it, don't let it get to you. ﻿Good morning, Dr. Solomon. ﻿Good morning. ﻿Quiet! ﻿Don't move. ﻿No, you can't move. ﻿Sit still. ﻿Is this your first time here? ﻿I'm just here for a blood test. ﻿Look, I'll show you something ﻿this'll help you. What do you prefer? ﻿Europeans? Asians? ﻿How do you like this one? ﻿What is that? ﻿A website? ﻿What, no Playboy? ﻿Check this out. ﻿It's all live. ﻿And in HD. ﻿You choose the location, too. ﻿Check this out. ﻿I'm telling you he'll call, give the poor man a day. ﻿He'll... ﻿I'm telling you, ﻿You gotta chill, girl, ﻿I bet you he'll call. ﻿Are you crying now? ﻿You're seriously crying over this? ﻿Oh, you're not crying, you have a cold. ﻿Take a deep breath, he'll call. I promise. ﻿Okay? ﻿Yeah, I'm just stuck in traffic, I'll be right there. ﻿I'm on it, invitations, the works, ﻿but I gotta go or... police... ﻿Liran. ﻿What's going on? ﻿I'm good, you? ﻿I have to get to work. ﻿You done? -You haven't gone in? ﻿I have, I need a second round. ﻿Come with me. ﻿Ewww, no way. ﻿Just for a second. ﻿Gross, I'm not going in there. ﻿Go in, think good thoughts... ﻿think about us, about Thailand. ﻿Thailand who? ﻿Our trip to Thailand. ﻿Oh, yeah. ﻿Remember our suite on the beach? ﻿What was I wearing ﻿What were you wearing? ﻿Nothing. ﻿Exactly. ﻿Sweetie-pie. ﻿I'm going in. -Good luck. ﻿A siren is sounding in Sderot and Sha'ar HaNegev ﻿we're now live from Sderot ﻿where civilians are fleeing... ﻿One rocket on Tel Aviv and you'll see what happens. ﻿Those people think they're so smart. ﻿Did you put the sticker on? ﻿What? ﻿So they don't get mixed up. I ﻿did, yeah. ﻿How are you doing? ﻿Fine. ﻿Don't be bummed out. ﻿Why would I be? ﻿We're all in the same boat. ﻿I've been here 9 years now. ﻿9 years? ﻿I'm sure things will work out for you. ﻿God willing. Listen. ﻿Wanna squirt some killer sperm? ﻿Before you come here next time, ﻿don't fuck for at least 2 weeks ﻿don't jerk off. ﻿My sperm is just fine. ﻿Thanks for caring. ﻿Listen to me, ﻿and when you jerk off in here, ﻿take your time, don't cum right away. ﻿Get to the verge, stop, get to the verge... ﻿stop, and do the same with your wife at home. ﻿You cum fast, no sperm. ﻿It's science, bro. ﻿I'm literally just parking. ﻿It's hilarious you're calling, just when I find a spot, ﻿but it's super far. ﻿Yes, I'll have to take a cab to the office, ﻿it'll take me about 10 minutes. ﻿Yeah, I'll be there in no time. ﻿Sure, bye. ﻿Stay away from soy. ﻿No soy, it has a female hormone. ﻿No Coke, no cigarettes, no Red Bull. ﻿Nothing. ﻿From experience, bro. ﻿Good luck. ﻿Back at you! ﻿You too. ﻿We're just fine. ﻿I think she's pregnant and she doesn't even know it. -Amen. ﻿What's his deal? ﻿Poor guy. ﻿They've been trying for 9 years. ﻿Some people have no luck. ﻿We should get started on treatments. ﻿But you said it's just a blood test. ﻿Do you want a child? ﻿Of course we do. ﻿Then trust me. - We do, doctor, absolutely. ﻿Would we be here if we didn't? ﻿But why treatments? ﻿There's a problem with your sperm. ﻿The tests show your sperm has low mobility. ﻿That's because I rushed it in there... ﻿There was a line, I didn't want to... ﻿You know how it is. ﻿You cum fast, no sperm. That's how it goes. ﻿I'm not referring to the quantity which is less than impressive, ﻿I'm referring to the quality. Your sperm is weak. ﻿Do you smoke? ﻿Just... -That's very bad. Stop. ﻿You have to work out. ﻿You have to eat healthy. ﻿It'll help us. ﻿Now, pull down your shorts. ﻿Now? ﻿Yes, now, I want to examine your testicles. ﻿Fine. ﻿Come closer. ﻿Relax. ﻿Take a deep breath. ﻿It's okay. ﻿What's so funny? ﻿Wait outside. ﻿Do you have a history of testicular cancer? ﻿God forbid, no way. Tfu. ﻿Sorry, doctor. ﻿It's very common at your age. ﻿No, no history. ﻿Deep breath. ﻿Wait outside. ﻿Okay, that's it. You're fine. ﻿I want you to do a few more tests. ﻿Why do I have to do more tests? ﻿It's nothing, just a uterus scan and a follicles test to monitor your ovulation. ﻿You'll need to come here for a blood test every two days. ﻿But, doctor... ﻿it's a crazy time at work, there's no way ﻿I can't come in every two days. ﻿It's your decision, guys, not mine. ﻿But if you're here, ﻿you do the tests and come back to me. ﻿Is that clear? ﻿Yeah, sure, we'll do it. ﻿Good. ﻿I think well find a solution very quickly. ﻿Look, ﻿after my wife and I got married ﻿we took a gorgeous trip to the Himalayas. ﻿Oh yes, I climbed mountains. ﻿And I had a little accident. ﻿I lost one of my testicles. ﻿We had to undergo fertility treatments for 15 years. ﻿Oh, yes. ﻿Why am I telling you this? ﻿These are my twin boys. ﻿Ronen and Avi. ﻿IVF babies, they're in the army now, ﻿so now I have other worries. ﻿Dr. Rosen -Yes. ﻿You're needed in surgery. -I'm coming. ﻿See you. ﻿How long are you off the pill? ﻿A year. ﻿This is your building. ﻿Wow. ﻿Click, look how gorgeous it is. ﻿But why the constant renovations? All that noise and dust. ﻿David, ﻿if there's an earthquake, we're all goners. ﻿The building will collapse. ﻿An earthquake? That's what troubles you? ﻿You'll be vacated at some point no matter what. ﻿Now's your chance to get a new apartment. ﻿Isn't it worth it? -And you get 1.5 meters more than us. ﻿Why does he get 1.5 meters more than us? ﻿The next-door apartment? ﻿Take the 1.5 meters, I don't need them. ﻿People, please. ﻿I already explained this. ﻿This is the best plan for your building. ﻿An architect designed it, not me. ﻿You have a larger bathroom. ﻿We're not getting into this again. ﻿You're leaving with the contracts and we're moving on. ﻿Babe, by next month you're pregnant. ﻿Finish your exams, get your MA ﻿and go on maternity leave. ﻿Nice. ﻿By then, we'll buy a cute two-room apartment in the center. ﻿lease it for short-term rentals ﻿and rent an apartment on the street you love. ﻿First get me pregnant. -I will, I will. ﻿No hospital, no nothing. ﻿That doctor got you stressed out over nothing. ﻿There's nothing wrong with you. ﻿You know what apartments they get? ﻿Again with the apartments? ﻿Don't believe him, it won't happen. -The contracts are signed. ﻿I'm buying your bar next year. ﻿And you. ﻿And I'll think long and hard about hiring you. ﻿How can you stand him? ﻿I'm crazy about him. ﻿But you should've married me, honey. -I know. ﻿Oh. -Oh. ﻿How's it going? -How are you? ﻿Great. -What's up, Ofer? ﻿Hey, bro. ﻿Okay, guys. ﻿To the project. -Amen. ﻿To the project. -Cheers. ﻿Cheers. I'﻿m so glad you two didn't give up. ﻿I'm proud of you. ﻿Dad, where is he? ﻿Liran? ﻿Where is he? ﻿Hold on, sweetie. ﻿Yeah... ﻿No, I only work with serious people. ﻿-What's wrong, Tal-Tal? -You know me... ﻿Why are you getting up? ﻿What's wrong with her? ﻿Where is he? ﻿Where is he? Where is he? ﻿What's wrong ﻿Are you okay? ﻿Yeah. ﻿We're here. ﻿Let's go. ﻿Good Sabbath. ﻿Good Sabbath, sweetheart. ﻿Talush, sweetie. -Nurit, what's this? ﻿You look amazing, so thin. -Really? ﻿I started a great course. Nothing but peels. ﻿Good Sabbath, Grandma. -Hello. ﻿Good Sabbath. -How's the leg? ﻿How are you? ﻿Dude, why so late? ﻿He's insufferable. ﻿Zucchini, eggplant, sweet Iceberg lettuce. ﻿Here. ﻿I just picked it, it's sweet. ﻿Sweet, like a popsicle. ﻿Look. ﻿And what's this? ﻿Chestnut squash. ﻿You slice it down the middle, a little coconut oil, ﻿30 minutes in the oven, ﻿you eat it with a spoon, delicious. ﻿The whole box is for you. ﻿Thanks, Dad. Yes. ﻿What "yes" ﻿Yes, I'm with you. ﻿No, listen, ﻿I'm not handling that anymore. ﻿Blessed are You, God, ﻿Who brings forth bread from the earth. -Amen. ﻿Bon appetit. -Thank you. ﻿Tali, ﻿you see this? ﻿Two hours ago it was still in the garden. ﻿And this one only eats peels. Why? Because. To spite. ﻿I've stopped interfering with his garden. ﻿He turned the yard into an open-air market. ﻿I can't have company over. ﻿Who am I growing vegetables for? For me? For her. ﻿So what, Moshe? ﻿It does her only good. ﻿Look how thin she got. ﻿I'm going to a great workshop, Tali. ﻿You have to come with me. ﻿You want her to start that PEELatis too? ﻿She's skinnier than a credit card. ﻿It's not about losing weight. Forget him. ﻿Come with me. ﻿You can come too. ﻿We have something to tell you. ﻿What's wrong? -Nothing, don't go crazy on me. ﻿It's not the end of the world. ﻿Ofer and I are trying to have a child. ﻿What? ﻿Wow, I don't believe it! ﻿Oh my god. ﻿Oh my god. ﻿This is awesome. ﻿Wow. ﻿Congrats, bro. ﻿It's about time. ﻿Congrats, Ofer. -Thanks. ﻿Man... ﻿I swear, the eggplant came out... ﻿amazing. ﻿How a child? ﻿Me and Ofer. ﻿With whom? ﻿A good friend of ours. ﻿I'm happy for you, sweetheart. ﻿Whose son will it be? ﻿Ours, Grandma, who else? ﻿Who's the father? ﻿Both of us, he'll have two dads. ﻿She wants to ask whose... -I got it, Dad. ﻿I'm the dad and the next child will be Ofer's. -The next child? ﻿Did you get that, Mom? ﻿This one will have a child before that one. ﻿I told you he'd jinx us. ﻿This is hilarious. ﻿What is? ﻿You want to tell them? ﻿Forget it, I'll tell them. ﻿What? ﻿We have something to tell you too. -What? ﻿We're also working on ﻿Yes! ﻿Ha! ﻿I have a great family. Cheers. -Cheers! ﻿Cheers, cheers. -Congratulations. ﻿Cheers, cheers. ﻿Today, as I was picking the zucchini I thought about you, I swear. ﻿Did you know that zucchini is great for pregnancy? ﻿I swear to God. ﻿I read it online, I wanted to print it out. ﻿Then why didn't you? ﻿Show me. -I'll go get it. -Who cares about Zucchini? ﻿-Congratulations. ﻿May God give you good luck. ﻿Thank you, Julie. ﻿How old were you the first time you got pregnant? ﻿I was 19 when I gave birth to this savage. ﻿Here you go. ﻿Zucchini. ﻿The perfect vegetable for pregnancy. Take a look. ﻿kicredible. Show me. You printed it out? ﻿It's a PR item. -Who is PR? ﻿Excuse me, it's my investor. ﻿How are you? ﻿No, I sent them everything. ﻿I'm at city hall on Sunday, I'll speed it up. ﻿The tenants are signing for two years. ﻿Two years and the building is up. ﻿No, next July the workers will be painting. ﻿No, white, that's a siren, I'm in Sderot. ﻿At my folks. -They ruined my Sabbath. ﻿I'll talk to you. Bye. ﻿Get up already. ﻿Damn them. ﻿Now they'll drive us crazy. ﻿They're human too, they also want peace and quiet. ﻿Come to Tel Aviv, Grandma, no rockets there. ﻿They'll reach Tel Aviv... ﻿Right, with their crappy rockets... ﻿It struck. Did you hearthat? ﻿You hearthat? It fell, Mom. ﻿I heard, I'm not dead yet. ﻿They should raze Gaza from the air. Those bastards! ﻿Iron Dome, my ass. ﻿One rocket from our army and they're toast. ﻿Like Hiroshima. ﻿Let's go. -Not yet! There may be more. ﻿There won't be. -With your luck, ﻿With your luck, you'll take one step outside and get hit by a rocket. ﻿God forbid, Dudu. Watch your mouth. ﻿Like that genius from the shoe store. ﻿He went out to take pictures, got hit by a rocket, turned him into mush. ﻿Here in Sderot? ﻿No, North Tel Aviv. -Nonsense. ﻿It was on TV! ﻿Nonsense! ﻿The project's amazing. It'll boost our firm. ﻿Shifra? ﻿Shifra? Shifra? ﻿Do you have a few minutes? ﻿Just 5 minutes, so make it quick. ﻿Shoot. ﻿I can't come in tomorrow morning either, I have something important. ﻿There's no one else to handle your clients. ﻿Shifra. ﻿What? ﻿I want to tell you something. ﻿But it's just between us. ﻿Of course. ﻿Um... ﻿My husband and ﻿started treatments. ﻿What treatmenst? ﻿Fertility. ﻿Oh no. ﻿Oh, sweetie, come here. ﻿It's no big deal, really, ﻿just a couple of sessions and we're done. ﻿Whatever you need, we're here for you. ﻿Okay? -Yes. -Good. ﻿I have to be at the hospital every two days for tests. ﻿You'll go A-Wall every two days? ﻿I'll come in at noon. ﻿It's not that simple. ﻿I need authorization from Asa. ﻿Okay, did you go over your orders? ﻿What? Yes. I'n on it. ﻿Great, good luck. -Yeah. ﻿"Women's rights - an employee undergoing IVF. ﻿"Can an employee undergoing IVF be fired?" ﻿What's wrong ﻿What is it, Tali? -Shhh. ﻿I'm sleeping, babe. ﻿Tali. ﻿I had a crazy day. ﻿Tomorrow, okay? ﻿Babe. ﻿It's gonna happen. ﻿You'll be pregnant by the end of this week. ﻿You hear me? ﻿Hello. ﻿Look. ﻿They put up a sign. ﻿Put that away, please. ﻿Yeah, in a second. ﻿What's written down here? ﻿It's my project. ﻿I'm in real estate. ﻿Here. That's it. ﻿Okay, ﻿I'm inserting a camera through your cervix to see if the uterus is intact. ﻿It's a bit painful, ﻿but we'll get through it. ﻿Then you stay here for a few hours, ﻿you must rest. -Wait, doctor, ﻿I have to be at worK in an hour, ﻿I have a super important meeting I can't stay here. ﻿The exam is risky, you must be under supervision. ﻿I'll supervise her, doctor. ﻿No, that's impossible. ﻿You can't go to work after this examination. ﻿Maybe we should postpone it. ﻿I have an important meeting at noon. ﻿Guys, I don't think you understand what we're doing here. ﻿There's a long line of people waiting for this treatment. ﻿We'll do it. ﻿We'll do it. ﻿You took an Advil, right? ﻿Okay, let's go. ﻿You stay here. ﻿Good luck, babe. ﻿We're almost done. ﻿TaItuI, the traffic was murder. ﻿How are you? ﻿I'm fine. -Yeah? ﻿They checked my uterus. ﻿How are you, Liran? -Fine. ﻿I need coffee, do they have coffee here? ﻿Sure, in the cafeteria. ﻿I'll get you some. ﻿Anything for you, babe? ﻿Dad, don't worry. -What did the doctor say? ﻿He's just running tests. ﻿We don't have a problem, ﻿but we have to start insemination. ﻿If there's no problem, why the treatments? ﻿Because we can't conceive on our own. -No eggs? ﻿No way! -What then? ﻿Liran. ﻿His sperm isn't strong enough. ﻿I see. ﻿Is it treatable? ﻿Yes, it's part of the treatment. -What treatment? ﻿I told you. -What? ﻿Insemination. If that doesn't work, we'll do IVF, ﻿but it won't come to that, I think. ﻿You shouldn't do it. ﻿They'll pump you with all sorts of drugs, it's dangerous, Taltul. ﻿Dad, I know what I'm doing. ﻿It's not dangerous nowadays and I'm going on 35. ﻿All my girlfriends have kids. ﻿They renovated here. ﻿Everything's new. ﻿Good conditions. ﻿Here. ﻿See you in two months. Well try again. ﻿Patience. We'll take you to the operating room soon. ﻿Keep your spirits up. ﻿That smile is a good thing. ﻿Keep it on. ﻿Take care of her, okay? -Yes. ﻿Thank you, doctor. -You'll be fine. -Thanks. ﻿Come with me. ﻿Well, ﻿your uterus is intact, ﻿so that's good news. ﻿When you leave here tonight, rest a little, ﻿but tomorrow night, the door is open, ﻿Invite the sperm in for a nice visit and then, ﻿lie with your legs up for at least 10 minutes. ﻿It'll help the sperm get where it needs to. ﻿Thank you, doctor. -You're welcome. ﻿My pleasure. ﻿Why did you stop? -Hold on, babe. ﻿I shouldn't cum fast. ﻿Seriously. ﻿It's science. ﻿Why do you keep stopping? -Hold on. ﻿Did you cum? ﻿Yes. ﻿Are you sure? Was there any sperm? ﻿Of course. ﻿Now you're a sperm doctor? ﻿It's inside. ﻿Lift your legs up. ﻿Dad. -Zvili! ﻿Zvili! ﻿What did I say, kids?! Enough with the water! ﻿You don't want any? ﻿No, I quit. -You should. ﻿This is quality shit. -Okay, give it here. ﻿It's strong. -Yeah. ﻿Are your folks okay with all the rockets down there? Sure, they're used to it. ﻿Insane, huh? ﻿They oughtta chillax. ﻿Man, this is strong. I ﻿grew it. ﻿I planted it over there. ﻿No, over there. ﻿No... ﻿Never mind. ﻿I wanted to ask your dad, the leaves are pale. ﻿Should I add iron? ﻿Don't talk to him about that. ﻿Don't worry, I won't mention the treatments. ﻿Dad, Zvili pooped in the living room. ﻿Ella! ﻿Zvili pooped on the living room floor. ﻿You clean it, I'm helping Lily with her homework. -Oh! ﻿Dad, clean it up, why does she have to do it? ﻿Fine, I'm going, I'm going. ﻿I'm telling you, ﻿don't be in a rush to have kids. ﻿Try it naturally until it sticks. This is the most beautiful time of your lives, enjoy it. ﻿Every... You motherfucker. ﻿Where's your pacifier? ﻿Babe, I'm sleeping. ﻿The more, the merrier. ﻿You heard the doctor. ﻿Good night, babe. ﻿Good night. ﻿Whoa. ﻿Are you serious? ﻿It just looks big. -It is big. ﻿"It just looks big," it's for horses. ﻿You gonna put that in me? -It's nothing, honey. ﻿Did you assemble it right? -Of course. ﻿Relax. ﻿It'll be fine. ﻿Okay. ﻿Relax your stomach. ﻿You have to relax. -You're not holding it right. ﻿Because you're not relaxed. ﻿Calm down. ﻿Your hand is shaking. ﻿Because I'm trying to hold it properly. ﻿It's delicate. ﻿See? You'll jam it in my heart by mistake. ﻿You just love stressing me out. ﻿Babe, it's just an injection. ﻿Okay. ﻿It's not even in yet! ﻿Relax. ﻿Hurry up. ﻿Did it hurt? -Like hell. ﻿Are you okay? -Yes. ﻿Good. ﻿Good. ﻿It was an amazing night. ﻿He sent me 20 texts. Look. ﻿Wow. ﻿But I don't know, he's kinda nerdy. ﻿Come on, Avi! ﻿I feel like firing him. ﻿I can't handle these juveniles. ﻿What about what we discussed? ﻿There's nothing more I can do, I'm sorry. ﻿How are the treatments going? ﻿Well be fine. ﻿What? ﻿We have problems. ﻿What problems? ﻿Sweetie, you know I got you. ﻿Problems with your uterus? ﻿No way. ﻿Liran has... ﻿He has a sperm problem. ﻿Seriously? ﻿Wow. ﻿So what do you do? -Keep trying. ﻿Yes? ﻿You guys do it all the time? ﻿Yeah, 3 times a day, I can't take it anymore. ﻿Wow. ﻿Sweetie... ﻿Okay. ﻿How long have you been together? ﻿6 years. ﻿That's a lot. ﻿I mean... ﻿my cousin's partner had a problem too. ﻿What problem? ﻿No, it didn't work out. ﻿They were incompatible. They split up. ﻿But then she got pregnant by someone else in no time. ﻿Funny, huh? ﻿Maybe you don't match? ﻿Of course we match. I ﻿hope so. ﻿When does the renovation start? ﻿What do you mean? Real soon. ﻿I have the permits from city hall. ﻿As soon as everyone signs and vacates the apartments, we're good to go. ﻿Excuse me. ﻿One second. ﻿Why should you leave your job? ﻿Wait for maternity leave, we need the money. ﻿Shifra is driving me crazy. ﻿I can't take her anymore. ﻿I've had it. ﻿I can't take it. ﻿Listen to me, babe. ﻿Hang in there until your maternity leave, ﻿soon you'll be pregnant, our whole life will change. ﻿And I'm about to get the first payment for the project. ﻿We cover our overdraft and bam, bring it on. ﻿Is it really happening? ﻿The tenants are here. ﻿They're outta there in a month or two. ﻿This is just our first building, ﻿there'll be plenty more after that. ﻿When are you done? -I'm finishing things up and I'm back. ﻿Break the whole house, why don't you? ﻿Lame-ass doorposts. ﻿They're no good. ﻿Of course they aren't. ﻿Forget work, let's watch a movie. It﻿'s been ages. ﻿But a comedy, okay? ﻿You're taking care of the popcorn? ﻿What's this? ﻿Almonds. ﻿They're good, they have zinc. ﻿It strengthens the... They're good. ﻿It's science. ﻿What's wrong ﻿What's the matter with you? ﻿I feel bad for them. ﻿Yo! ﻿What the hell...? -Will you shut the fuck up?! ﻿People are trying to sleep here. ﻿Shut up! ﻿What? ﻿Tali, what is that? ﻿Tali... ﻿Where are you going? ﻿Tali, let's go home. ﻿Come back home. -Get your hands off me, Liran. ﻿Wait up, Tali. ﻿Let go of me! -Take it easy. ﻿Mister, close the door. Mind your own business! ﻿Why are you screaming at him? ﻿Tali, that's enough. ﻿Calm down. -I said, get off my back! ﻿Where's your mom? ﻿She's not home. ﻿Keep it down, okay? ﻿What are you doing? ﻿You don't want to? -Not like this. ﻿You prefer jerking off tomorrow? ﻿Calm down. ﻿I'm calm. -No, you're not. ﻿That's it. ﻿10 minutes and you'll be on your way. ﻿Got it? ﻿It's not happening. ﻿Give it a second. ﻿The second line is coming. -No, it should be there straight away. ﻿Wait a minute. ﻿We're not pregnant. ﻿Hold on a second. ﻿Code Red. -Moshe. ﻿Code Red. -Moshe? -What? ﻿Code Red. Code Red. ﻿What's with you?^ Get in the secure room. ﻿Enough is enough. ﻿Get in before I tear up the garden. ﻿Code Red. -Hurry up! ﻿Alright! -Code Red. ﻿Code Red. ﻿I've had enough... -Where's your mother? ﻿She can't hear. Mom! ﻿Code Red. -Mama. ﻿Hurry! ﻿We have to look for you all the time... ﻿Code Red. ﻿God help me! ﻿Hear O Israel, God is one! ﻿Doctor? -Yes? ﻿You said there's a problem. ﻿Yes. ﻿I think insemination is a waste of our time. ﻿We should start IVF. ﻿You've been here almost a year now, ﻿and your sperm is deteriorating, ﻿its mobility is decreasing rapidly, so... -How come? ﻿I work out, I quit smoking. ﻿I only eat almonds. In ﻿any case... ﻿I'm taking your sperm and moving it to the end of the race. ﻿Excuse me. -Yes. ﻿Yes, Dad. ﻿What? Where? ﻿Oh, man, a rocket fell outside my parents' house. ﻿All their windows broke. ﻿Are you and Mom okay? -We were in the secure room. ﻿Thank God. ﻿Your vegetables, dad? Are you kidding me? ﻿So you won't have beans this year, you could've died. ﻿Dad, I'll call you back, I'm in a meeting. ﻿What, when? ﻿Sure, of course. ﻿I'll call you. Bye. ﻿Bye. ﻿I'm sorry. -Yes. ﻿So you were saying I'm infertile. ﻿No, God forbid. ﻿Let's not blow this out of proportion, guys. ﻿If we think it's just your sperm, ﻿there's no reason IVF won't work. ﻿Can't the sperm be improved without IVF? ﻿Not really. ﻿No male hormones? ﻿I'll inject him. -Tali. ﻿Medicine is not a democracy. ﻿We have to move on to IVF. ﻿There's no time. ﻿Wait. ﻿How are your parents? ﻿They're fine, the house is a mess, they have no electricity, they're on their way here. ﻿What? ﻿Liran, this is a bad time. ﻿What do you want me to do? ﻿Tell them not to come? -Talk to me first. I ﻿am. ﻿There's nowhere to park, dammit. ﻿You know where I parked? ﻿By the National Theatre. ﻿I'll never understand how you can live like this. ﻿Tell your landlord to get you a parking spot! ﻿Parking here costs more than your home. ﻿You're suckers, you two. ﻿Ew. ﻿What is this? ﻿You drink milk? ﻿Milk isn't for humans, it's for calves. ﻿Ew. ﻿This is poison too. Goodbye. ﻿Liran, ﻿Hey, sweetie. ﻿Wait, I love those puddings. ﻿This? ﻿It's whipped cream made of animal bones. Would you eat your dog? ﻿That's nonsense. ﻿Nonsense, my foot. Eat soy. ﻿I'm not allowed. ﻿Why not? ﻿Because I don't like soy. ﻿Well, I brought you peels in honey and Tehina ﻿Eat peels, it's healthy. ﻿We won't eat that, Mom. ﻿Don't give me that, it's as healthy as it gets. ﻿Liran? ﻿Hmm.. ﻿I'm still ovulating. ﻿Giddy up. ﻿Your grandma's here. ﻿What is this? ﻿Why doesn't it open? ﻿Grandma, it's me. -I have to pee. ﻿Let's do this. -Won't you get in trouble? ﻿The owner is in France, honey. ﻿Damn them... ﻿Liran? -May God burn their asses. ﻿Didn't I say they'd reach Tel Aviv?! ﻿Dammit. And we came all the way here... ﻿Where's their secure room? ﻿Liran! -What secure room? ﻿This is Tel Aviv, everyone's clueless. ﻿Where did they go at this hour? ﻿To the stairwell. -Liran! ﻿Bentzi. ﻿What a surprise. ﻿How's it going ﻿Fine. ﻿When did you start wearing glasses? ﻿What do you mean? ﻿They're for work, I always... ﻿What's going on? -What is this place? ﻿My office. -Oh. ﻿Let's sit down. ﻿I know your folks are at your place and I didn't want them to hear this. ﻿What's wrong? -How are the treatments going? ﻿We're starting IVR ﻿That's what I felt. It's a mistake. ﻿I'm afraid it'll harm Tali. You have to help me here, Liran. ﻿She has no idea how dangerous it is. It﻿'s our only chance for a kid. -Why? ﻿I want to show you something. ﻿Look. ﻿These are Georgian mothers. ﻿This way Tali won't have to harm her body. ﻿They take her eggs, your sperm ﻿and they do all the work. ﻿No, no... -Ill pay. ﻿For everything. ﻿Hotels, flights, the works. On me. ﻿We don't want a surrogate. ﻿We want our own kid. ﻿You have a sperm problem, ﻿And you send my daughter to kill herself with these treatments. ﻿What's with the attitude, Bentzi? ﻿I don't care about her? ﻿I suggest you get used to surrogacy. ﻿Never gonna happen. ﻿You see this ring ﻿I've had it since I was 21, ﻿the year I married Tali's mother. ﻿It was the happiest year of my life. ﻿She died. ﻿Tali was born. ﻿Is that what you want for you? ﻿Tali? ﻿Tali? ﻿Tali? ﻿What's that? ﻿Uh... ﻿a lucky plant. ﻿The guys bought it for me. -Oh. ﻿They bought it for you. ﻿Wow. ﻿Amazing. ﻿Show me. ﻿It's beautiful. ﻿Why am I not one of the guys? ﻿don't know. ﻿That was nice of them. ﻿Can you sit down? ﻿Things are pretty hectic here because of the war ﻿So I need the reports on my desk tomorrow. ﻿Tomorrow? ﻿Yes ﻿It's not enough time. -I must have them. ﻿So work on them all day long and figure out some way to have them on my desk by tomorrow morning. ﻿I need them, so... ﻿And I need... ﻿I need... What do I need? ﻿I'll tell you what you need, Shifra. ﻿What? ﻿This big. ﻿Tali! ﻿I say this with love, Shifra, you're... ﻿an unbearable... woman. ﻿Working here ﻿is torment. ﻿I can't take it anymore, ﻿I have enough problems as it is, ﻿and I don't need your crap too! ﻿Tali. ﻿Tali, wait. ﻿Tali! ﻿Tali, your bonsai! ﻿Liran said you have the day off. ﻿Uh, yes. ﻿Come to the peels workshop with me? ﻿I'd love to, Nurit, but I can't. ﻿I have tons of errands. ﻿But it'll do you good. ﻿The women are wonderful. ﻿We're not psycho like Liran thinks. ﻿Besides, you'll have fun. ﻿Not only does he look at me differently, ﻿he talks to me differently. ﻿Wonderful, excellent! ﻿But he still makes fun of me for eating it. ﻿Wonderful, let him! ﻿Who else wants to peel herself? ﻿I'd love to peel myself. -Nurit. ﻿How are you? Where are you? ﻿Tell us about the last month, I see a huge change. ﻿You look amazing. ﻿Thank you. ﻿Excellent. ﻿Okay. ﻿I never thought I'd lose 6 kilos this month, ﻿but it's not only that. ﻿It's this feeling of great relief. ﻿As if someone lifted a 16-kilo suitcase off my back. ﻿Of course, you're peeling away what your body doesn't need. ﻿That's true. -Excellent. ﻿Nurit, ﻿the change is evident. ﻿And it's not easy at home, either. ﻿My husband grows vegetables. ﻿Girls, ﻿if you never let yourselves eat bananas ﻿because of the massive amount of calories in it, ﻿so here you go. ﻿The same nutritional value ﻿but without the calories. ﻿Go ahead, sweetie, it's organic and washed. ﻿What's your name, sweetheart? -Tali. ﻿Girls, Tali just had a baby and she wants to lose weight. ﻿What? -No, no. -But I don't see a problem. ﻿She's confused, I told her... -What did you tell her? ﻿-Oh! I'm sorry, I got it. ﻿You're pregnant. ﻿Did you try purple peels? ﻿Congratulations. -Excellent. ﻿No, I'm not... ﻿I'm not pregnant. ﻿We're... ﻿doing IVF. ﻿You don't have to... -Why not? ﻿This is a peel workshop, isn't it? ﻿So let's peel away. ﻿I can't conceive ﻿because my husband, Nurit's son, ﻿has a problem ﻿with his sperm. ﻿Tali, please... -It's the truth. ﻿Nurit. ﻿It's the truth. ﻿My husband ﻿has no sperm. I mean, ﻿his sperm is so sparse that the tests show nothing. ﻿There's no... mobility. ﻿And with every passing day, it only gets worse. ﻿Our chances of getting pregnant are dwindling, ﻿so, Nurit, I guess you won't have grandkids. ﻿God forbid. ﻿I will, God willing. ﻿And how does that make you feel? ﻿It sucks. ﻿Our sex is dull. ﻿Mechanical. ﻿There's nothing there. ﻿And Liran, ﻿he's so ashamed that... ﻿he didn't tell you. ﻿He didn't tell his family, because that's the way he is. ﻿So he's constantly... ﻿making up excuses. ﻿Not that he's a liar, he just... ﻿believes his own excuses. ﻿And he's the one with the problem. ﻿But I'm undergoing the treatments. ﻿I'm the one... ﻿injecting myself with hormones, ﻿risking my body, ﻿experiencing nausea and vomiting while he's the one with the problem. ﻿And... ﻿he's not attracted to me anymore. ﻿I can feel it. ﻿Even though he pretends we're good. ﻿I can tell ﻿that I disgust him. ﻿Let's go, sweetheart. ﻿Tali, ﻿I knew. ﻿Liran told you? -No. ﻿Would he tell me? ﻿I saw the syringes in your fridge. ﻿His dad was the same way. ﻿It took him time before... ﻿Don't worry. ﻿You'll get pregnant. ﻿How do you know? ﻿That's how it is in their family. ﻿All the men have weak sperm. ﻿No, sweetie, don't cry. ﻿Bon appaetit. ﻿What's with the sourpuss? ﻿Pardon me for breaking up with my love in the past couple of years. ﻿His face always gave me the creeps. ﻿Mama. ﻿Dudu, ﻿children aren't everything. ﻿It's not as if you already had a child, ﻿you wanted a child. -Okay, that's enough. ﻿You'll find a new guy soon. ﻿Who also wants kids. ﻿Dad, it's Dudu who just broke up, not you. ﻿And what about you? ﻿What about me? ﻿You guys are taking your time... ﻿Why did you even tell us you wanted a kid? ﻿Why? ﻿I have one foot in the grave. ﻿When do you run out of eggs, anyway? ﻿That's enough, Moshe. -We have enough, don't worry. ﻿But I do worry. ﻿You're old. ﻿It could be dangerous at her age. ﻿Ever think about that? ﻿Dad, cut the nonsense. -Nonsense? ﻿At 35 the uterus drops, did you know that? ﻿What if you want another child? ﻿Only one grandchild, that's it? ﻿How about you shut your trap? ﻿Tali. ﻿What did you say? ﻿Shut ﻿I can't listen to any more of your crap. ﻿I cannot hear it anymore. ﻿Has she lost her mind? ﻿You don't know when to shut ﻿You should be ashamed. -No. ﻿I'm not ashamed. ﻿You're guests in our home. -You're not ashamed? ﻿Then tell them. ﻿Tell them what? ﻿Tell them, Liran. -Tell them what? -Tali. ﻿Tell them. ﻿What? Speak up. ﻿Wait, I want him to tell me what's wrong. ﻿We've been undergoing. - fertility treatments for a year. ﻿Unable to get pregnant. ﻿That's it. ﻿What a blow. ﻿Did you know? -Yes. ﻿Why didn't you tell me? -Moshe, I asked her not to. ﻿I didn't want you to feel guilty. ﻿What, ﻿you didn't tell him. ﻿One year and you say nothing? -What's the difference? ﻿You're ashamed to tell us? ﻿It's hard, Dad, and you're making it harder. ﻿Then maybe we should leave. ﻿Yes. ﻿You should. ﻿Get up, let's go. ﻿Mama. ﻿You went too far. ﻿Not at all. -You did. ﻿Why didn't you tell them the truth? -I told the truth. ﻿Aren't we undergoing treatments? ﻿You need treatment. ﻿Doctor, ﻿are we done? ﻿Yes, for now. ﻿You're brave. ﻿Did it work? ﻿The sperm is okay? ﻿Mobility-wise? ﻿Look... -What? It failed? ﻿We're not giving up, don't worry. ﻿But what's wrong? -I suggest you rest. Lie down. ﻿Wait, Doctor, what's wrong? -We did everything we could. ﻿Doctor. ﻿Doctor. ﻿What the f...?! ﻿You're next, bro. Go in. ﻿Yeah. ﻿Thanks. ﻿Galit, Alexei. ﻿Look who's here. ﻿Itzik, how's it going ﻿Congratulations. ﻿Liran. ﻿I don't believe it. -Yes, bro. ﻿That's awesome. ﻿Congratulations. ﻿I had a hunch when I hadn't seen you here for a few months. ﻿He's so cute. ﻿Wow. ﻿How exciting. -Dude, ﻿are you going in? You're next in line. ﻿Go in before me. -Okay. ﻿Amazing. ﻿He's so sweet. ﻿It finally happened. ﻿After 9 years of treatments. ﻿But once he was born, ﻿It all flew out the window, like we never had a day of treatments. ﻿We did, we did. ﻿It's all behind us now. ﻿I'm happy for you. ﻿You two are next. ﻿Soon. ﻿Don't give up, bro. ﻿Take care. ﻿Well go say hello to the doctor. ﻿We brought him a picture. ﻿Congratulations. ﻿Thanks, bro. I'm next. ﻿And I'm after him. ﻿You have five embryos. ﻿Now well transfer them. ﻿Be patient, we'll soon take you to the OR. ﻿Keep your spirits up. ﻿That smile is a good thing. Keep it on. ﻿Take care of her, okay? -Yes. ﻿Thank you, doctor. -You'll be fine. ﻿Tali, dear. ﻿You're so brave. ﻿How do you feel? -Fine. ﻿Good. ﻿Doctor, ﻿how many embryos? ﻿One. ﻿Just one? ﻿It has some issues, but we'll try to enhance it. ﻿Just one embryo? ﻿And it's faulty too? ﻿Shouldn't we have had at least 6 or 8? ﻿Some women left here with 18. ﻿Everyone differs, ﻿but we know we have a sperm issue. ﻿Doctor, tell me the truth. ﻿What are our chances? I don't want to have false hopes. ﻿No false hope. ﻿We succeeded with couples who were worse off than you. ﻿I want to know what our chances are. ﻿It's hard to tell, I can't make any promises. ﻿But all you need is one embryo. ﻿Just one, and you have it. ﻿We'll do our utmost to make sure it's implanted. ﻿Babe, one embryo is better than none. ﻿Sorry, I have to take this. ﻿Liran, don't. -It's the investor. ﻿Liran, please don't. ﻿Nissim, ﻿I'll get back to you, I can't talk now. ﻿No need to yell, Nissim, I'm meeting them tomorrow. ﻿Yes, it'll be signed tomorrow. ﻿Nissim... No way! Calm down. ﻿I'm telling you I'm on it. ﻿He'll sign. ﻿It's not related ﻿He's old. ﻿I'm sorry, doctor, I just don't believe it'll happen. ﻿I'll talk to him. -Tali. ﻿Look at me. ﻿Tali, ﻿I will do my utmost to help you get pregnant. ﻿The lab is working on the embryo, ﻿I'm not going home ﻿until I'm sure we did everything we can. ﻿Alright? ﻿I have permits, I have a contractor. ﻿I need another 40,000, give or take. ﻿Yes. ﻿How could I know that... ﻿Hold on, Nissim. ﻿You listen to me. ﻿Start taking what she's going through more seriously. ﻿Understand? ﻿Otherwise this won't work. ﻿Do you even want a child? ﻿Of course. ﻿Then start acting like someone who wants to be a father. ﻿Yes, I'll talk to him. He'll sign. ﻿I'm doing my best. ﻿Not true. -Liran. ﻿Hang up. ﻿Nissim, let me get back to you. ﻿Yes, thanks. ﻿What do you want? ﻿I want to talk. ﻿It's my investor. ﻿I couldn't care less. ﻿Those hormones really screwed you up. ﻿Enough with the hormones. ﻿Look how you're behaving. ﻿No more treatments for me. ﻿What? -You heard me. ﻿But we just started. -It's been a year. ﻿I'm jeopardizing my health. ﻿We'll get pregnant and then discover that I have cancer. ﻿Your dad got to you. -No, ﻿I can feel it's harming my body. ﻿Babe, we're in this together. ﻿We're not giving up now. ﻿Didn't you hear the doctor? ﻿They're working on the embryo. ﻿He can't promise anything. ﻿We're getting worse and you refuse to accept it. ﻿I heard what the doctor said. ﻿What do you expect him to say? Stop the treatments? ﻿If he says it can happen, I believe him. ﻿And if we don't have any? ﻿What? ﻿Kids. ﻿No kids? -It's possible. ﻿Really? ﻿What will you leave behind? ﻿Our dog? Who will die before us... ﻿Is that what you want? ﻿To grow old without kids? ﻿Are you even capable of being a father? ﻿I'll be an awesome father. -Oh yeah? ﻿Will you raise him with your Bluetooth? ﻿On your phone? ﻿You're tripping. ﻿Maybe you do need glasses. ﻿Not only to show off to your clients. ﻿Do you even want my child? ﻿Huh? ﻿That's why you're not getting pregnant. ﻿You know why I'm not getting pregnant? ﻿We're like roommates, Liran, ﻿we're not a couple anymore. ﻿We haven't been in ages. ﻿Because you got difficult. ﻿Are you serious? -Dead serious, Tali. ﻿And you're not alone here. ﻿No more treatments. -Fine. ﻿Maybe we really aren't compatible. ﻿Compatible? ﻿We don't match. ﻿We don't match? ﻿Leave. ﻿Be with another man. -Okay. ﻿Okay. ﻿What's going on, Liran? ﻿Go home, man. ﻿I'm not going home. ﻿I'm not going back to her. ﻿It's over. ﻿What are you talking about? ﻿Those hormones made her crazy, bro. ﻿She's psycho. ﻿It's embarrassing. ﻿It's all good, she's crazy about you. Go home, take a shower. ﻿She doesn't want me to be the father of her kids. ﻿She doesn't want kids with me. ﻿And she knows things are insane at work. ﻿I have 70,000 invested in this project. ﻿80 calls a day just on this crap. ﻿All day long I'm wearing this piece of shit! ﻿It's giving me a brain tumor! -Calm down! ﻿Don't tell me to calm down! She's the one who made me infertile. ﻿My dick is gone. ﻿Dude, you're pathetic! ﻿Look at you! ﻿The treatments didn't mess Tali up, you did. ﻿She doesn't want kids with you because you're an idiot. ﻿If I were Tali, I'd run away from you too. ﻿And she has to have sex with your disgusting ass. ﻿You're nuts. ﻿Shame on you for kicking out the folks in the middle of the night! ﻿Your grandmother! With all the sirens? ﻿Is this who you want to be? ﻿"I have an apartment, I have a building..." ﻿Just wait and see. -You have nothing! ﻿Just fantasies! ﻿Is that why I gave you 70,000 for? ﻿Don't worry, I'll pay you back. -I don't want the money, ﻿you jerk. -Fine. ﻿You know what your problem is? -Move. ﻿You're weak. No tolerance. ﻿Are you stupid? -Shut up. ﻿You're not a man, you're more of a faggot than I am. ﻿Let go! ﻿Let go! ﻿Fuck you! ﻿I'll fuck you up! -You can't fuck! ﻿Son of a bitch... ﻿You have nothing. ﻿Soon you won't have a wife either. ﻿Hello? ﻿Yes? ﻿Okay, yes. ﻿Yes. ﻿Thank you. ﻿Hello? ﻿Yes, I'm leaving now. ﻿I'll get back to you. ﻿Bye. ﻿Hello, David. ﻿Liran, the renewal contractor. ﻿Your building... ﻿I used to have glasses. ﻿Oh, yes.

I don't have a car, I have a mobility scooter. ﻿Then a spot for your scooter. ﻿Ah. ﻿A parking spot is good. ﻿Should I sign? ﻿Yes. ﻿You said you would at the meetings. ﻿This is just a formality. -Yes. ﻿Here. ﻿If I sign, you'll get a parking spot for your car? ﻿What? ﻿No, no, no. ﻿Not me, David, you. ﻿Oh. Good thing you came. ﻿I want to show you something. ﻿I can't find it. ﻿I can't get through for some reason. ﻿You're a good guy. ﻿Shall I make you a cup of tea? ﻿Wait, I didn't sign. ﻿You don't have to. ﻿Hello? -How's it going ﻿Good. ﻿You alright? ﻿Yes, Dudu, I'm fine. ﻿Tali called me. ﻿She's at the hospital, you have an embryo. ﻿Okay. ﻿Liran, I want this to work. ﻿You know I love you. ﻿Me too, Dudu. ﻿Good luck. ﻿Moshe? -What? ﻿There's an embryo. ﻿What embryo? ﻿Tali called Dudu. ﻿Yes? -They're on their way to the hospital. ﻿The embryo is being transferred into her uterus. ﻿There's an embryo? -Moshe, there's an embryo. ﻿There's an embryo. ﻿Yes! ﻿There's an embryo, Moshe. -There's an embryo. ﻿How are you? ﻿So-so. ﻿Babe, just say the word and we're going home. ﻿I won't lose you, not for a kid, not for anything. ﻿Nothing else matters. ﻿I want to do this. ﻿I love you. ﻿Do you need anything? ﻿Can I get you anything? ﻿How about a hug? ﻿After my wife and I got married, ﻿we took a gorgeous trip to the Himalayas. ﻿Oh yes, I climbed mountains. ﻿And I had a little accident, I lost one of my testicles. ﻿We had to undergo fertility treatments for 15 years.
