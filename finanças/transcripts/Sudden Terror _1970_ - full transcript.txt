Take aim! Fire! Ole! Ole! Ole! Ole! Ole! Grandpa, grandpa, grandpa! Grandpa, do you wanna know something? I am prepared to listen to facts, sir, not gossip. I just seen a ship sunk! Just sailing along, and then it blew up! Torpedoed! Don't think there are any survivors. Really? Where? Over there! Can you see anything? No, it's as you said. No survivors, sunk without a trace. - Grandpa? - Yeah? When sailors drown, do they wear St. Christophers? That's a very good question, very good. But being an army man, I'm not prepared to commit myself. Nevertheless I've always held the view that the Navy was improperly dressed at all times. Speaking of which, I suggest, sir, that you see your Batman. Sort yourself out, smarten yourself up, otherwise you're gonna be late for parade. Hop it, dismissed. Good boy. One gun, fire! President's launch is approaching. In a few moments, he will step on to the quayside to be received by our prime minister as the first head of state to visit this island. Chief inspector galleria, controller of security, will escort the president to independence square for the official reception ceremony. The marine band, looking splendid in their dress uniforms are standing to attention, ready to play the national anthem as the president, dressed in traditional costume, comes into view. The scene is one of rich pag- Go and check the security on the square. I've already done so, sir. Go and check the security on the square. Sergeant? Yes sir? Get the car. Yes, sir. Come on. We have to recheck the security. Tell me, you've been here a lot longer than I. Is he the same with everyone? Or is it just me he doesn't like? He doesn't trust anyone until he's known him a long time. And he's afraid. Ah, Borneo, I see. Yes sir. Ziggy! Come on! Oh, stand still, Ziggy. If your hair is untidy, the president will see it when he drives past, yes he will. Then what will be the result? He will say "who is that disgusting little boy "who can't be bothered to brush his hair for my visit?" No he won't. He doesn't mind things like that. We're old friends. Aren't we, grandpa? Yes, known him for ages. Don't say things which aren't true. You ready, Ziggy, you ready? Now you're keeping your sister waiting. I shall tell the president what you said and he'll probably have you shot. Give him my regards, won't you? Listen. I'll lie if I feel like it. It's my lighthouse. Help, help! Pippa, is that for the president? No, sunshine. It's a hearse. Come on, monster. Partners! Partners. Whoah! Mommy, mommy! Mommy! I can play the drum. In fact I can play most instruments. No! Come on. Well now, I didn't know you played the drums. What other instruments do you play? Bagpipes! Oh really? Come on, Macvee. Ziggy, Ziggy, would you please come here? Will you try and stay close to me? Look, I'm supposed to be at the front. The president said I must be at the front. He wrote to me and said so. Oh, and I suppose he invited you back for tea afterwards? Yes, and he's going to- - you little liar, be quiet. One of these days, something you say is gonna come true. What's that? Have a look for yourself. All right. Guard, shoulder arms! At ease! Guard, present arms! Thanks. Right, sergeant, get me a radio. Clear the square. Roger, come on. Where's my brother?! Where's my brother, I can't leave my brother! Ziggy! Ziggy, where is he? I searched this place, nothing here. Try next door, come on. Don't worry, we'll find him. All clear in there, sir. Right, check the roadblocks. On the double, come on! You got it sergeant? Yes, sir. I can't go home without him. Look, he'll be all right, I promise you. Boys are always all right. Blast. Would you rather I drove? Look, he knows his way around, doesn't he? Move on please, move on. Yeah, yeah, fine, okay sir. Well, I expect like us he was just moved along by the police. Oh come on, he's probably having the time of his life. Where do we go, home? Which way is home, this way? Look, soon as we get to your place, we'll organise something. But I bet you any money you like he's there waiting for you. My name's Tom, Tom Jones. And I don't sing. What's your name? Pippa. Huh? Pippa Armstrong-Smith. Okay pippa Armstrong-Smith. You show me the way home. We'll look for your brother on the way. Pippa! Pippa! Pippa! Ziggy, where have you been?! I've been so worried about you, I looked for you everywhere, where have you been!? - Let go! And I'll tell you if you'll just listen! Tell me. Well, your sister's been very worried. You're telling me. I don't know what I'd done if this gentleman hadn't been here! Look, let me explain, give me a chance! All right, what now? You're such a chronic little liar! Can't we get in the car? No, we jolly well cannot! You'll wait here, you can walk home now. Please, pippa. What's the matter? They're chasing me! Oh, don't listen to him. Who are? I'm Tom, by the way. The people who did it! What people, Ziggy? The people that shot that man! Stop it, stop lying! I'm not lying, I saw it! Well we all saw it, we were standing there! Well what did you see? I saw a bloke. The man who shot him! Ah, liar! You actually saw the man that fired the gun? Yes, promise, cross my heart! Only you don't know him as well as I do. He'd say anything to get out of trouble. Well what sort of man was it? It was a policeman. I give up. Can I get in the car, please? - No! No, no, - they chased me! They're trying to kill me! - No! They? Two of them, two policemen. Look, will you leave him there, please? He deserves to be taught a lesson. This man, the one you said that shot him, what did he look like? He looked like a policeman. But why would a policeman wanna chase you? Not one, two. Because I saw it. I was in the next room. What room? The room in the cafe. I mean you know him better than I do. Could he be telling the truth? Of course he couldn't! He invents everything! See, get off my hat! I know I do make up things sometimes, but this time it really happened. Well I don't know. Well I do. If you'd been here last week he'd have told you about his experiences on d-day. He was there, he saw that too. You'll get into trouble for telling lies this time, specially when somebody has been killed. God will punish you. Look, I told you, they're coming! Please, pippa, go faster! I thought you said policemen were chasing you. That isn't even a police car. But they could be in anybody's car! Please, pippa! Ziggy, you shoddy little fool - hold it! I've told you so many times! Whoah, whoah, whoah. The panic's over. I'll drive. Now just sit there! Don't move, I don't wanna hear another word! I can now see what your sister means. Boy, you really had us going. I came here for a holiday. I get a front row seat on an assassination and a free ride with Walter Mitty. Any news? Yes sir. That was hospital patrol. They were dead on arrival. All right, air, sea, nobody moves. Nobody moves, understand? Yes, sir. I've already anticipated you. Well don't anticipate me because I might change my mind. John Heath. Roadblocks manned? Yes sir. Good. Television house. Grazzini! So, good job, eh? You did very well. Could I have the money? I've got to get off the island quick. Where's Victor? Don't worry. Here. Ugh! Now. Let's find that kid. What they'll do, or rather what they should do or rather what I would do, anybody that knows their stuff would do, is of course impose a curfew. Incidentally, thank you very much indeed for looking after my granddaughter. It was my pleasure, sir. Yes, I'm sure it was. I daresay you'd have done the same thing for an older woman, wouldn't you? Hmm. Oh, lord, what on earth was I gonna do next? Oh I know. Keep an eye on that thing for me will you? Anything happens, give me a yell. Won't be long. Right. Well, he wasn't one of us, of course, poor chap, but there's no harm in doing the right thing. You in the war, were you? No. Why not? Well by some incredible oversight, my parents neglected to conceive me until 1945. Smart dick. It was all brylcreem at my time. Short back and sides. Well I suppose we might as well have a drink. Where's pippa? No idea, she was pretty upset. Well of course, she was. Very nasty business. Make very good nurses, girls. But only after the bullets have been fired. They don't like the actual thing. Well, who does? Quite, quite. Right, now then, what would you like to drink? Oh, anything. Anything, what sort of answer is that? Vodka and coke. No you won't. Don't keep the stuff in the house. No actually, you've got a very good choice. You can have a Brandy or a gin. A gin. No, you can't have a gin, I don't like the smell of it. Would you like a Brandy? Yeah. Where the hell is pippa? I don't know, sir. Known her long, have you? I met her today. Oh, really? Well you picked a very good day for it, didn't you? Yes, that was more than I can say about my second wife. I married her on V-J day. It was the last bloody cause for celebration I had. Oh, I'm sorry about that. Nothing to be sorry about. It's just a question of attitude really. I mean, for example, what's your attitude towards pippa? Nothing. Nothing? No. You're not a poof, are you? No, I'm not. Thank god for that. Far too many of them around these days, you know. Cheers. Yeah, cheers. Standby. Hello, oh there's something going on here. I'll never forget when king George V was dying. The announcer on the wireless, Alvar Lidell or Stuart Hibbert or something. The king's life is peacefully drawing to an end. Very moving, that was. They shut up all the shops. More than they'll do here I think. Attention please. Would you please stand by for an announcement of national importance. What's happened to the army then? I don't know, sir. I'm not asking you, I'm asking him. Good evening. Evening. Well already you've heard the sad and tragic news of today's events. Events which have not only shocked all of us here on this island, but also the rest of the world. It is no exaggeration to say that tonight, the eyes and ears of the world are focused on us. Get to the point, for goodness sake. Violent events demand violent answers. And it is therefore my unhappy duty to inform you that martial law be declared, and that a state of emergency therefore exists. We already know that. A curfew has been put in effect from 1800 hours, that is six P.M., until 0800 hours, eight A.M. tomorrow morning. It will continue until the assassin or assassins have been arrested and placed in custody. You should have caught them by now, my dear. Boo. Do you know you have a bald spot? You're a cheeky little thing. You better look after your guest, my darling. Where are you staying, by the way? Oh, with some friends. Well you've had that, haven't you? I mean you put your head around the door tonight, these jokers will blow it off! You are British, are you? Of course he is, grandpa. Well doesn't he look British? With all that hair? Well, we better put him up. Find him a room. Lend him one of your nightdresses. Thank you. Don't be late for dinner. Oh and, seen Ziggy have you? I've locked him up in his room. What's he been up to, something unusual? Oh, no, nothing unusual. Good. What can I do with this? What? What is it? It's Brandy. Don't you want it? No. I'll drink it then. You do that often? No. You feel all right? I think you better sit down. I'm sorry but, do you mind if I turn that down? - No. - May we remind you that a curfew is in operation. I'm sorry about landing on you, I mean, staying the night. It's been a day to remember, hasn't it? Yeah, it definitely has. Is there always that much blood? I don't know, I've never seen anyone killed before. Well, not in real life, that is. Well, I can't forget it. He was sitting there, waving, smiling. Yeah. Do you think they'll catch him? The man who did it. Oh, I don't know, there could have been more than one. I don't know. They don't always. Frightening thought is, this is an island. And he's on it. Yeah. There, that any... Better? Hey, you all right? Hey. You all right? Mm, I think so. I think it was the Brandy. Ah, you're not gonna be sick, are you? I don't know, I might. She's not feeling very well, you see. I gave her my Brandy. That is, that is to say that I don't drink it myself and she just wanted a slip, I mean sip, yeah, yeah. Tom Jones. Ma'am, I'm staying the evening. Well, I can't not stay the evening because of the curfew and the, colonel, yeah the colonel. Colonel lent me a nightdress. He said would I stay. What's the matter with you, pippa? Huh? I said what is the matter with you? Oh, nothing. I just feel a little faint. Hmm. There's one extra for dinner then. Yes. Mr. Jones is staying. Mmm. Well, I've obviously charmed her. Don't worry, she's always like that. You feel okay? Yes, I feel a bit better. Well you did more or less inject it straight into the vein, you know? You always as nice as this? Now that you kind of mention it, yes. I'm actually a very super person. Oh? Oh but you don't have to worry. I'm not a hands up a dress merchant, I like to be asked first. About your brother, you do think he was lying? Oh yes, he lies all the time. If it hadn't been that, he'd have told you I was married with three children. Well, are you? No. I'm divorced and on the pill. Well then ma'am I'm just gonna have to announce my intentions to the colonel after dinner. Well now, sir, I think he'd like it in writing. I'm all right, I'm all right, ma'am. Dear colonel. No. I know you're joking. I really am frightened. It's not the drink either. I'm just frightened. For what we are about to receive, may the lord, where's Ziggy? Still upstairs. I told you, he's locked in his room, grandpa. Being punished, is he? He's been very, very naughty today. Make us truly grateful, amen. Amen. Please be seated. Point is, does the punishment fit the crime? He frightened the life out of me, grandfather. He ran away. Did he? Ah, thank you. Any salt in this? Yes, but not enough for you. How about you, young man, do you want some salt? She never puts enough in. Well, after you, sir. Oh, thank you very much, that's fine. We're in the square when the shooting was going on. He just ran away. We were being pushed off the streets and I couldn't find him anywhere. If it hadn't been for Tom, Mr. Jones, I don't know what I'd have done. You would have found another Mr. Jones, my darling. Girls always do. But the thought of him running away, that's out of character. Well he did say he saw the man who did it. What man? The assassin. He said he saw him? Grandpa, that's just a lie to get himself out of trouble. No, no, no, no. There's something totally out of character for him to run away. You see, lies are one thing. Most boys are born liars. I mean we all know that Ziggy has a particularly vivid imagination. One might almost say genius for inventing the most plausible stories. But not actual lies, no. You lie as a boy, did you? Yes, I think I did. I did all the time. I was always lying. I enjoyed lying. Never took to that George Washington stuff. He always seemed to be a bit of a creep to me. Madam, would you be kind enough to ask Ziggy to come down please? - Yes, sir. - Thank you. Well you might as well start. Please, before it gets cold. Who on earth can that be? Who is it? It's the police, sir. Police? Show them into the study please, will you, madam? Yes, sir. Excuse me just a minute. Can I help you? Oh, just checking, sir. You know about the curfew, I take it? Yes, we saw it on the box. Caught anybody yet? Not that I know of, sir. Called out the army yet? Yes, colonel, every available man's on continuous duty, sir. Good. It's a nasty business. It's a dirty business, assassination. It's rather like sniping, there's something singularly unfair about it. Yes, sir. You haven't noticed anything, sir, have you over the last few days? Any strangers for instance? Strangers? Everyone's a stranger to me. I don't go out very much. I see. How many people live in this house, sir? Normally? Normally? Three, no four. That's including me. And they're all here now? Yes, yes. No, there's an extra one. I don't know, we got him in there. He's a stranger, I suppose. A stranger? Yes. That makes five, sir. That makes five, that's right. You wanna see him? Yes. Yes I would, please sir. Well of course you may. We're all in the other room. Would you like to follow me? Thank you, sir. You said five people, sir. Yes. Well there's my grandson. Of course he's upstairs in his bedroom but he's just a little boy. I mean, you wanna see him? No, no, that's all right sir. Well, we shan't be needing you again. I hope. But if you have an emergency of any sort, then I should be grateful if you'd ring that number. Thank you very much. Have you got any leads yet? I wouldn't know, sir. Fine. Your passport, sir. But you do understand that no visitor is to leave the island without permission? Yeah, yeah. Good. Thank you, colonel. Not at all. Good night. Good night, sir. For what we are about to resume, oh it's gala night in the mess tonight. Cold soup and burnt pud. It's me. Gosh, what are you doing out? It's not allowed, everything's curfewed. Look, I've got something to tell you. It's a matter of national importance. But I'm in bed! Look, if you don't get up, I shall never tell you anything ever again! I shall probably even cut you out of my will. Oh. All right then, wait there. Oh, now that is what I call apple pie. Full marks, madame. As a matter of fact I think I'll have seconds. How about you, my boy? No, thank you. No, thank you? Well you wouldn't catch Ziggy saying no. Good god, we've forgotten the prisoner. Spring him, someone. Tell him to come downstairs. He can have some apple pie if he'll answer a few questions. Thank you. But why can't you go to the police yourself? Look, I told you, if I go, I might go and bump into the wrong man. And then he'd kill me! Don't you understand anything? Well, all right. Now go on! All right. All right, now don't be frightened. What are you doing out at night? You know you're not supposed to be out tonight, don't you? Where do you live? Do you live around here? What's your name? Anne-Marie. Anne-Marie? Where were you going, Anne-Marie? Police station. The police station? That's where we're going. I think you better come along with us, don't you? Good, come on then, little one. Any sign, my darling? No, nothing. What do you think he's done? Well he's gone! Aw bloody ol, absent without leave, that's what he's done! Come on. Oh, he is a naughty boy. Now look, where's that telephone number the policeman gave us in case of an emergency? Come on, find the telephone number. All right now, right. What was that story of his? Well, as I told you before he just said that he saw the man who did it. But pippa said, well, he always says things like that. What's that, my darling? Double seven, double seven. Double sevens. Now, do you think it was one of his usual fantasies? Well I don't know. I'd had thought so, but you know Ziggy. Oh darling, the older I get the less I know about anybody. Just a minute, just a minute, pippa. Hello? Yes, now right, now then, who are you? Duty sergeant here. Yes sir, yes. Just give me your name, sir. Look, check on the report from the dock area and get your men down there, okay? Right, name of child, sir. Right sir, we'll check into that. And can we have your number, sir? Thank you sir, we'll get right on to that. Missing child, who we got? Nobody at the moment. Well, hand it over to mobile police. Right. Well just deal with it, will you? Right. Hello? Duty sergeant here. Hello, all patrol cars to harbour area. Yes, yes, yes, yes. All suspects to be brought to headquarters for questioning. Any news, sergeant, anything fresh? We picked up a suspect in the dock area, sir. He's being brought in now. It's all down there in the square staring us in the face. Forget the kid. We must get away. He saw me. That kid's dangerous, he must be killed. It's only a matter of hours before they discover your other mistake. We must go. He saw me. I sometimes have good ideas, you know. All right. You want to go, you go. Okay, where you gonna find the kid? You haven't got second sight, that we know. I'll find him. I'm a good policeman. Well, what have we got here? I picked her up in the street like this. In the street? What were you doing in the street, hmm? She said she was coming here. Oh, all right. Get me a cup of coffee, will you? And a sandwich maybe. Right. Would you like a cup of coffee? Make it two. Yes. Come, young lady. Over here. Right. Blessed line's engaged now. It's that policeman bit that interests me. I'll tell 'em about it when the line's free. And Mr. Jones, did Ziggy describe him? Well you can't very well, can you sir? You can't what? Describe a policeman. Well they do have the habit of looking alike. What are you talking about? Don't be ridiculous, policemen all look alike? Of course they don't. I mean take those two that came here earlier this evening. I could describe them. I couldn't. Darling, women are not observant. I was trained. There were two of them, remember, two? There was one here by the table, the one that did all the talking. Remember him? That chap, remember? And then there was another one in the corner. Sort of... The other chap. The point is I would recognise them if I saw them again. I see. And your friend Ziggy, what's his other name? Armstrong-Smith. Yes? Yes. Armstrong-Smith, eh? With a thing between them. And he says a policeman did it, does he? Yes. Do you believe a policeman would do a thing like that? I don't know. But you like policemen, don't you? Oh, policemen don't go around killing people, do they? Still, it was right to come and tell us. Very good girl. Now, we must get you back home and to bed. Come, oops. Where's your friend Ziggy now? He's waiting for me. Waiting at your home, is he? All right, we'll have a word with him. Who's around who's got transport? I'll find out, sergeant. Look outside, and take this young lady home. Good night, Anne-Marie. Come. Hey, you. Where are you from? HQ, special patrol. We're checking all possible suspects. Well, never mind about that. The sergeant would like this child taken home. You take her, take the Jeep. Where do you live? Down there. Come on then. I told sarge all about it. Did you? Yes. See my friend Ziggy, he knows who shot that man on telly. Does he now? Yes, he saw it. He saw the policemen shoot him. But sergeant says policemen don't shoot people. But Ziggy says they do sometimes. Do you know where Ziggy is now? Oh, he's in my garden. You see, we're not supposed to be up. But Ziggy's always doing things he's not supposed to be doing. He lives in a lighthouse. A lighthouse, eh? That's a funny place to live. Well, you must introduce us to him. There's one basic flaw in this case, you know what it is? Well I've got my own theory, sir. Yes, I'm sure you have, my friend. But theories don't solve murders and they don't solve assassinations. There's one basic flaw in this case. We're treating it as an assassination and it is not. What's the difference? With a simple murder, you look for a different type of man. Has your friend Ziggy told anyone else about what he saw? No, only me. He's on his own, is he? Yes, he's waiting for me. Are we nearly there? Its just around the corner. Anne-Marie, run, it's them! Hey, what are you doing?! Daddy! Daddy! All right baby, all right, baby. Somebody's been shot. A man and a girl. Two men just ran away. I'm gonna get help, you take over. Right, you two stay here. The rest come with me. Hey. You're in a hurry my boy. Look, I've got something to tell you. Where you off to, hmm? They're trying to kill me! Shh! - And why are you up so late tonight, hmm? - Please! Look, they're trying to kill me! What do you mean? Now, yes, yes. - Shh, please! They'll hear me! Just stay calm. Now keep calm, my boy. Now tell me the policeman's chasing me! - Quite specially, - The one who shot the president! Who is trying to, what do you want? This is the house of god! Agh! Did you get him? No, I lost him in the catacombs. I had to do some shooting. I was almost caught by some soldiers. I had to bluff my way out. We must get that boy. He'll go home. We know where he lives. Missing kid. That rings a bell. What is it, sergeant? Remember, there's this girl that came here. Mhmm. The name of the boy she was on about. Yes, Armstrong-Smith. Get me headquarters immediately. Did the wife see anything? No, sir, it was all over by the time she got down there. What about the army bods? No sir, they arrived after out chaps. Who was our chap? I don't know, sir. Don't know? Yes, sir. Who filed the report? There hasn't been a report, sir. All our information came from the army. Then you better find out, sergeant. If a policeman sees a man killed, a kiddy murdered, then another policeman better find out, hadn't he, sergeant? Yes sir, we are chasing it. Right, good! Right, give me that other report about the boy. Right, sit down. What do you make of all that? What's the common denominator in all that, hmm? You don't know. Right, well I'll tell you. You know the father brown story about the postman who was a murderer? Everybody saw him but nobody saw him? Well who's the postman in all that lot? The president is shot. A waiter is killed, a child is missing, another child is murdered. What is the only common factor? Ourselves, us. The police. We start with the assassination, don't we, sir? Yes, that too. It's the same link. How, sir? Who else was sitting in that car? Did it ever occur to you, did you ever think that the unknown assassin shot the wrong man? Maybe we should be looking for a different kind of enemy. A good old-fashioned, traditional, enemy within. Yes, right. Fine, fine, we'll expect you. Thank you, good bye. Who was that? The police. - Have they found him? - No, darling. But they're coming over. Apparently, that little girl in the village, I can never remember her name, got a turned up nose, had tea here a couple of times. - Anne-Marie! - Anne-Marie. Well apparently, she's been to the local station. Any news? Yes, the police are coming over. They haven't found him? No. It's all my fault. Pippa, you stop that! It's nobody's fault! Now the point is, if anyone's gonna go awol, they always plan ahead. Now where would he go? Possibly the fort. Where's that? It's the place we go to at weekends. Not on the blessed phone, you see. Mind you, Parker's there. - Parker? - Parker, he's my Batman, he'd take care of him. Anyway, don't you worry. Just leave it to me. I'll take care of it. Oh, splendid, keen anticipation. What a first class adjutant you would have made. Police are on their way now. Be kind enough to show them in, will you? Yes. I'm very worried. Such a little boy. Don't worry. Little bad pennies always turn up. Oh, I'm so glad you're here. We've been so anxious. Is the boy home yet? Oh no, but we think we know where he is. Where is that? Well. Madame? My god! Stop it! Don't be like that, shh, shh, shh. Did you see anything? No, no, but I heard a car pull away. By the time I got to the window, it was nearly out of sight. A car, what sort of car? Looked like a Jeep, a police Jeep. Police Jeep. Go and get dressed. Where we going? To the fort. But what about the car? Good, ah go and get dressed. Right. I want a head count of every policeman on the force. You tell me who's missing, and I'll show you the way to our killers. I don't know what names they enlisted under, but one of them was called Paul Grazzini. I shot his brother in law not half a mile from here, remember? The mafia has a long reach, a long memory. Right, gentlemen. Let's get to that boy's home. Now you two stay there. Parker? Ziggy? Parker? Grandpa! Grandpa! You little sod. Now then, where's Parker? He went to phone the police, sorry. Sorry, grandpa. It's too late for that. It's too late, now you listen to me very, very carefully. Your aunt Robiac's dead. Now, now, you see, Ziggy, I got to have the truth. Now tell me, who did you see? I did, I did see him, grandpa! I know, I know, but who?! The man. The policeman, you mean? Yes! You saw him fire a gun, now that is the truth, is it? Yes, I've been telling you all along. All right. I believe you. Now then. He saw you? Yes. He chased me, then there were two of them. Two? They tried to kill me! Come on. Colonel? Colonel? Ziggy! Granpa, Parker's dead, they know we're here! Listen to me. Now I want to get these two away from here. If I create some form of diversion, do you think you can get to the car? Yeah I think so. There's a good lad. - Hey, colonel. - What? What about a Molotov cocktail? What a bloody good idea. Pippa, where's the Brandy? Downstairs in the kitchen. Right. You know what to do. Right, sergeant! Right, off you go. Up the tower. Agh! Stay down. No! No! Pippa! Tom! Ziggy! Ziggy! Ziggy! Grandpa? Yes, my dear boy? I've just seen Hitler! Oh, lord. But I know- - shh, shh, look. Don't start that. Hitler died in a bunker in Berlin in 1945. But I know it's him! Dear, dear, dear. Where?
