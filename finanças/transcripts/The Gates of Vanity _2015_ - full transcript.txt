(ticking movie reel) (bass-heavy somber anthem) (tweeting birds) - Man's a giddy thing. I think it was the first time he'd ever cooked a meal. Certainly the first time a curry. Instead of two teaspoons of chili powder, he put in two tablespoons. (laughter) You really couldn't eat a mouthful it was so bloody hot. And this guy sat there eating his own creation. Drenched in sweat, his face turning purple, wouldn't, couldn't admit he'd made a terrible mistake. I think that was the first and the last time he ever cooked a meal for us. - Well I'm not surprised. - But my point is, that our base emotions haven't changed in a hundred thousand years. Our behaviors changed, been conditioned, but underneath all the civilized veneer, we're still little more than animals. - (howls) Where's my bone? - Yes, you can laugh, but it doesn't make it any less true. - What, we can't control our emotions? - I'm not saying that, I mean some of us are better at suppressing than others. But it's there in all of us, bubbling away. Our vanity, our ego is what drives us. - What, so fifteen thousand years of ethics and values and beliefs, don't have a say in our affairs? - Well they have some say, yes, but not much. Look if it's a straight fight between our emotions and our beliefs, then our emotions win every time. - If what you say is true, then we'd still be living in caves and clubbing each other to death over scraps of meat or whatever. - But aren't we doing just that? Just on a grander scale with all the trappings of modernity. - Oh you are talking rubbish. - Oh am I really? - Boys, I'm tired of this conversation. - Do you know the only people to have ever seriously addressed our ego problems? The Buddhists. - (laughing) What, so we could just see you with a shaved head chanting Hare Krishna down at the High Street? - Yeah, you can laugh. - Thanks Nigel, we are laughing. (melancholy string music) - Oi, what are you doing? Just go. - Why do you have to be so antagonistic with Nigel? - I wasn't. Just so up his own ass. - Overgrown schoolboys, both of you. Well nothing. - You're still mad at me about the money? - What do you think? - I said I'm sorry. - And that makes everything fine? - What do you want me to do? - Stop gambling. - I said I would, I've stopped. - How many times have you said that? - I mean it this time. - So all the other times were empty promises? (somber strings music) - Why is she being like that anyway? I don't understand it. I mean she's calling me up like every minute. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Dreadlock Rasta. - Don't touch me! - You've got a bag? - Oi! (grunting and smacking hits) Stop that! I've called the police, they're on their way. (laughing) - Let's go man. - You okay? You alright? Here. What were they attacking you for? - Apparently, they did not like the way I look. - Morons. - Yup, that is one way of describing them. I could have used my martial arts skills, but I am a man of peace. I forgive them, for they know not what they do. I do not actually drink alcohol. - Sorry. - Perfectly understandable. You were not to know. I would have some fruits, if you have any. - There you go. - Thank you. Much appreciated. - It's okay. Here. Some of these. You sure you're okay? - Yes, thank you. Take care, Good Samaritan. - How's it going, Tom? - You're toast Dad. - How bad? - Burnt toast. Extremely burnt toast. - What now? - Mum is in the front room. - I'm staying here then. - Man up, Dad, man up. - Easy for you to say. - Whatever. - Do I need my lawyer? - I've just found out that you didn't pay the deposit on the holiday flat. - I was going to, I just forgot. - And what did you do with the money? I might have guessed. It's like a disease with you. You need a therapist. - Can't afford one, I've gambled all the money away. - It's not funny! - We can always book somewhere else. - And with what? The kids were looking forward to going back there again, now we're all stuck at home for the holidays. - It's only until I get another contract. - You don't know when that's going to happen, do you? - Yeah, Barry's putting me up for a shoot coming up in September. - You could be looking for other work in the meantime. - I am a set designer, I'm not some dodgy builder's mate. - Right, fine, gamble everything away while you're waiting for something to turn up. Look, I am sick of your reckless, selfish behavior. It's putting the family at risk. Don't touch me. - If your class, you're replaceable. - You do not get many of his kind coming along. - I haven't seen anybody as good as him and what he did. He was a true master of the art and science of defensive midfield. - How we could do with him? - Our defense is crap. Him number two goes up, I don't feel safe. - Too many prima donnas. - Everybody wants to be a star. Go up field and score. - You are right. - Nobody wants to do the dirty hard graft. - True. - We need more water carriers. Without a water carrier, the team has no life. - Water is an essential part of life. - Yeah, thanks anyway Barry. Yeah. Bye. - No? - Name just seems to be mud. - Don't take it so personally. - I'm going for a drink. - Got a couple of Arsenal tickets. The guy I normally go with can't make it this time. Would you fancy coming? (laughing) (crowd cheering) - Got time for a shower? - No, we're leaving now. - It'll take 10 minutes. - We're not going to wait for you. - Why didn't you wake me? - I didn't want to disturb your drunken slumber. - I wasn't drunk. - Coming home at three a.m., falling all over the place. - Didn't know I was being monitored. What? I didn't say anything. - Actually, I'd rather just go with the kids. - Why? - I don't want Mum to get upset with you two arguing. - I didn't do anything. - You just shouted at Amy. - She was winding me up. - I'm going on my own, with the kids, end of. - Why is it always my fault? - You're the adult here. Do something useful. Paint this room like you've been promising. - Okay. If it's what you want. - Come on Tom, let's go. - Why doesn't Tom stay here with me? He can help with the painting. - No, Mum would want to see both of them. - But not me. - Don't be so melodramatic. - Fine, I'm being melodramatic now. - Yes, you are. - And I love you too. - Stop it. - C'mon Tom. - Try not to do anything stupid. - Thank you for your faith in me. - I'm not going to put up with this for much longer. Do you understand? (chiming bell music) - Shit. (snoring) Shit! Fuckin' hell. (retching) - Alright? - Are you alright? - Yeah, never better. Apart from my family deserting me. - What do you mean? - Ah, my wife and kids have gone away to see her dear mother and I'm not wanted. - I am sure it is just a misunderstanding. - Yeah, misunderstanding, that's what it must be. Sorry, I didn't mean to burden you with my stupid family saga. - No, it's not a problem. I am a good listener. (sighs) - It's complicated. Anyway, I better get back and start painting the blessed room otherwise I'll be in even more trouble. - I can help you with that, if you want. - Ah, I don't want to bother you. - It is no bother, seriously. I am just sitting here with nothing to do. It would be a good opportunity for me to pay you back for the football ticket. - Well, if you, if you're sure. - Yeah, I am serious. Can I bring this with me? - Yeah, of course. (sticking ticks of paint on surface) - Bless us oh lord, and these your gifts which we are about to receive from your bounty. Through Christ our lord, Amen. Thank you so much for this. You are a good cook. - Nice to have someone appreciate my food. Are you sure you don't want some? - Never drink alcohol, water is fine, best drink there is. - I like water too, mixed with liberal quantities of whiskey. - Second coat tomorrow. - Yes, good day's work. Thanks. - Least I could do. I enjoyed it. (Ben laughs) I'll get my bag and see you in the morning. - You're welcome to stay here. - No, I could not impose. - You wouldn't be. I'm here all by myself, so you wouldn't be disturbing anyone. And we can make an early start in the morning. (jet engines) (tweeting birds) (tense strings music) (distant sirens) - Good morning. - How long have you been up? - A couple of hours, I thought I would give it a start. - You should have waited for me, at least given me a shout. - I did not want to wake you. Happy to get on with it myself. - Thanks. You have any breakfast yet? - No. - You want some? - Yes, thank you. How long have you lived here? - Ah, just over 14 years I think. We were in London Fields before, but we needed a bigger place. - It is a beautiful house. - Thanks. Coffee? - No thank you, caffeine is no good for the body. - Okay. - I used to live in an old Victorian house. - Oh? - A long time ago now. - How long have you been ... - Homeless? - [Ben] Yeah. - A few years now. Seems like forever. - Sorry, didn't mean to pry. - That's alright. We all have a past, some people's more complicated than others. - Bless us Oh lord and these your gifts which we are about to receive from your bounty. Through Christ our lord, Amen. - So, how do you think we'll do on Saturday? - It all depends on if they have taken their sleeping pills. - That's a good one. - Sometimes I think it would be more honest if they came out with their sleeping bags, if they are not going to try. - Yeah, bring a deck chair. At least we know what we're getting. Perhaps the club should supply them each with an on-pitch valet to make sure they don't get too dirty. - Maybe their valets should keep the ball and make tackles for them. - Yeah. Well in the future, they'll just clone the spoiled brats, program the clones to actually try. - They could crossbreed the clones. - Yeah, get DNA from the past greats, make your own mix. - Cross Beckenbauer with Vinnie Jones, have a cultured Rottweiler. And, have a remote control that can instantly switch DNA? - Pele plays a beautiful game, beats five defenders, gets into the goal area, with a goal keeper beaten, just tap it in from three yards, and you switch Diaskew, blast it over the bar. - I'll join you with water for once. (clinking glass) (twittering birds) Good job. Well done. Thanks for all your hard work. - It is alright. (loud exhale) (clears throat) - Well, this is it. - You can stay here for a few days if you want. - What about your family? - Like I said, they're away for a week. It's me here. - Yes, thank you. (shower running) (knock) (tense strings music) - Sorry, I am not very good at this. - All you need is practice. And to try it harder. - Okay. (mobile ringing) - A job rejection. Cannot be bothered to phone in person. - You should try to stay positive Ben. I believe everything has an upside. - Everything? - Absolutely everything if you look for it. - I can think of a few situations that won't have an upside. - It depends on how you look at it. We all have enduring strengths. That which does not destroy us, makes us stronger. - Friedrich Nietzsche, don't get me started on Nietzsche. - The man was a genius. - Or a madman with dangerous ideas. - Dangerous ideas? No idea is dangerous in itself, it is only people who make it dangerous. - Well, anyway it was heavily influenced by Nietzsche. - Well that may be so, but you cannot control who gets influenced by what you write or say. - I'm surprised you're so taken with Nietzsche. Didn't he promote that God is dead? - Have you ever read Twilight of the Idols? - Actually, yes I have. - Well perhaps you should read it with a fresh perspective. You may see things differently. - What, you think I'm too stupid to digest a book? - Apologies. I did not mean to offend, it is just my humble opinion. Perhaps my wrong opinion. It must be difficult to be out of work with a family to support. - Oh, something will turn up. Actually it's extremely depressing not knowing. If you knew you were going to be off work for a set period, you could kick back and enjoy it. - Yes, uncertainty is difficult to deal with. - It's hard for Louise and the kids as well. - So how do you spend your time? - Ah, trying to make contacts for the next job. Helping out old dears at the local lunch club. That's solving. - The world needs more people like you, Ben. - Thanks. - Listen, don't sleep on the floor tonight. You can have my daughter's room, she won't mind. Ah, she may too, but she's not here. (intense strings) (whispered prayers) - Bless us, Oh lord, and these gifts which we are about to receive from your bounty, through Christ, our lord, Amen. (pouring liquid in a mug) - Do you have to say this Jesus thing every time before we eat? - Yes, Ben. I have to thank the lord, for all his bounty. - All his bounty goes to his bishops. He's a security blanket for losers, who don't have the strength or the will to believe in themselves. - Please, do not speak disrespectfully of our lord again. - I'm sorry but I've got a splitting headache and I don't want to have a happy, clappy breakfast. - Is your headache from drinking too much alcohol? - What? - Do you have a hangover? - Yes, I got a bloody hangover. - Why do you drink so much? - Why is it any of your business? - I am only trying to help you, Ben. - I don't need your help. You're not my psychiatrist. - No Ben, I am not your psychiatrist. But have you wondered why you have put so much faith into a bottle of alcohol? - So what are you trying to say? - I have said all I needed to say. - Well, I don't understand why you put so much faith in God, and in Nietzsche, they're polar opposites. - To you they may be polar opposites, they both speak their truths to me. - [Ben] They speak to you? - Yes, Ben, they speak to me, and I hear what they want me to hear. I am sensing some hostility from you, Ben. - No, I'm just curious. - Really? Are really curious, Ben? - Yeah, I'm curious. - I am going to lie down in my room. (intense bass strings) I am weak. I am so weak. Father, give me the strength. I don't want to be this weak. Please, help me lord. Help me be stronger. I don't want to be this weak. Father, I am begging you. Help me be stronger. Yes Ben, can I help you? - I'm just checking you're okay. - I am fine, thank you for your concern. (chirping birds) (somber strings music) - What are you doing here? What's the matter? - I could not sleep, can I come in? Can I come in? - No. - I thought you were curious. - What? Can you go back to your room please? Go back to your room please. - Good Morning. - Good Morning. - I prepared some breakfast. - What was all that last night? - I thought that was what you wanted. - What I wanted? What gave you that idea? - When I was in the shower, the way you looked at me. - I was looking at you, while I gave you your clothes. - I thought ... - You thought wrong. - I am sorry. - Listen, I think after breakfast you'd better leave. - Please, please, I do not want to leave with a bad feeling. I want us to part as friends. One more day, please, I will not be any trouble. It is important to me that we part as friends. - It's best, you leave. - Find Jesus in your heart. - To hell with your Jesus. - Please, do not take the lord's name in vain. Come kneel with me and beg for forgiveness. - Stop making a fool of yourself. - It is not too late, Jesus will save you. - Get up you loony. - Do not call me loony. - Just collect your things and leave, you loony. (whispered prayers) - I had to tape up your mouth, because of all the profanity spewing out of it. Shall we see if we can communicate a little better now? - Untie me you lunatic. Ah, god, god, fuck you. - You've not learned your lesson, have you? You never learn, do you? (screams and groans) - What the fuck are you doing? (cries out) Get off me. (mumbling) - I gave him a chance. I gave him a chance, I gave him a chance. I should not have to let people abuse me. No I will not, I will not, I will not, I will not. I am respectful. You are going to behave like a pig, I am going to beat you like a pig. Some people just have to be taught the hard way, do they not? But you people, do not want to understand. I will not be bullied. Those days are over. (Ben cries out) Have faith in me. Trust in me. I am your salvation boy. (Ben screams) Somewhere, a little more private, I think. (Ben sobbing) Maybe I can work some sense into you here. (Ben grunting) Sit against the bed. I am going to take the tape off your mouth. Are you going to spew out anymore profanities? Any insults? Are you going to shout for help? Alright. One transgression, and my wrath will be upon you. - Why are you doing this to me? - You're asking me why? - Yeah. - You have committed the greatest sin. You have blasphemed against our lord. - I'm sorry. What can I do to atone? - Atone? Atone is it now? I will decide, God will decide if you're fit to atone for your sins. - Just tell me what to do, and I'll do it. - In good time. If you place yourself in God's hands for your judgment, he will decide when he is ready. The first step to atonement, is submission. Do you wish to submit of your own free will? (Ben scoffs) Do you wish to submit of your own free will? For the third and final time, do you wish to submit of your own free will? - Yes, I submit. Of my own free will. - Good, I am going downstairs. Do not move one inch, or utter a single sound. If you do, I will know that you have been insincere to me, and your atonement cannot begin. - Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! (Ben cries out) - [Andrew] I will put this right through your eye. Do you take me for a fool? Now, let us try that again. (door creaking open) Good. You have finally learned. Your atonement can now begin. One day you will be grateful for this experience. You will remember it as your rebirth. Are you ready to be reborn? Are you ready for your improvements? - What are your areas for improvement? - It is not about me, it is about you. More precisely, about your anger. - My anger? - I can feel it rising in you again. - Tied up by some ... - Good. You nearly said something you may have regretted. You are learning to curb your anger, even if you cannot control the source of it. Were you aware of your anger problem? I think you were. I also think that other people had pointed out your anger problem to you. Am I right? I know I am. If you do not talk about it, I cannot help you. And if I cannot help you, I cannot let you go. Tell me about your anger. Did you get angry as a child? - Yeah, I got angry as a child. - And? - And what? - And what happened? How did you deal with it, give me an incident. - It was at primary school, bully took all my marbles. - [Andrew] And? - I got angry. Lost my marbles and got angry. Have you ever lost your marbles? - I offered you my help and time, but you continue to ridicule. Never learn, do you? How can you atone if you do not learn? Shout out if you want, call your neighbors to witness your sordid affair. - What do you want me to say? - I want you to tell me about your anger problem. - Okay. I admit I have an anger problem. Help me to deal with it, I want to be cured. I want to be saved. - I will help you. Tell me what causes your anger. - Don't know. Anything, everything even, it all depends. - I do not mean daily things that trigger it, I mean the real root cause. The real monster that is hiding in there. You can treat the symptoms, but if you do not get to the root, the weed will keep coming back. So what is the root? - I don't know. - What is the root? What is the root? What is the root? (mobile phone ringing) Shall we see who that was? Louise, your wife. I wonder if she has left you a message. - [Louise] Darling, I hope you're okay. I've rung you a couple of times, but you don't seem to be answering. I hope you weren't too upset about what I said. I was really stressed out about my mum, I didn't really mean anything. We'll get through this. Please ring me back as soon as you can, I'm worried about you. Lots of love from us all. Love you. - How touching. Moving on to the business in hand. Looks like you have had some financial problems, judging by some of these letters to your bank and loan company. Internet habits, wow, a lot of hits on gambling sites. Looks like a gambling addiction to me. Explains the financial problems. Sex sites. Wow, shemales, I knew it. - You knew what? - That you were hiding your base desires. - I'm not hiding anything. I was curious sometimes. - Really? Is that why you're curious about me? - I was not curious about you, how many times do you have to be told? You're the one with the sexual hangups. - I do not have any hangups, sexual or otherwise. I know exactly who I am. - Who are you? Fine to dissect my life, what about you? Let's talk about your life. - What do you want to know? - What went wrong? - [Andrew] Why do you assume something went wrong? - You wouldn't be here doing this to me if nothing had gone wrong in your life. You wouldn't be sleeping rough on the streets if nothing had gone wrong in your life. - Did it never occur to you that I may have chosen to discard the conventions of a so-called normal life to have freedom? Look at you. You have a normal life, but are you really free? You are a slave to conventions. You are tied up by a stranger in your own home. Am I right? A slave to conventions and a slave to your base desires? - Tell me about your childhood. Tell me about your childhood. Are you scared to tell me about your childhood? - No Ben, I am not scared. I have the lord with me, why should I be scared? I have nothing to hide, I will tell you all you want to know. I was born in Rwanda. Father was killed when I was three. Mother brought me up and my younger sister by herself. When I was 10, she sold me for adoption to a British couple. - And? - And they brought me to England, and raised me as their son. - Was it a happy upbringing? - Father said happiness is for self-indulgent people. The lord put us on Earth to do our duty. I was brought up to respect our lord. - Are they still alive, or are they dead? Did they treat you well? - They treated me well, if I stayed on the right path. - What happened if you didn't stay on the right path? - Father was very strict. - Did they beat you? Did they beat you? (door slams) (chair creaking) (Ben breathing heavily) (Andrew whistling Amazing Grace) (Ben breathing heavily) (grunts) - You my friend, have a nose for trouble. What you must realize, is that what determines power is how far you are willing to go. I will do whatever is necessary because I have nothing to lose. You, on the other hand, have a great deal to lose. Including your pretty little eyes. That my friend is the true essence of freedom, when you have nothing to lose. That is why I chose to have nothing. This is what you have. Interesting. Your son still wets the bed. Your daughter has a serious drinking problem. A whole bottle of whiskey in one session? That takes some doing. How desperate do you have to be to do something like that? Do you think if she was brought up by sensible parents she would do something like this? - She was only doing it for a stupid bet. - That makes it alright then? Doing things for a bet makes it alright? I wonder where she gets that from. Your gambling disease is spreading to your children. What kind of a father put his gambling habits before the needs of his children? My friend, you do not deserve to be a father, or a husband. Do you know that your darling wife Louise has been writing to her friend, Jane, about you? Not very complimentary. Your mood swings, your gambling addiction, your lack of interest in the bedroom department. This letter is eight years old. Are you aware of how disgusted your wife is by you? Have I hit a soft spot? Or are you just feeling sorry for yourself? You really are a careless man. You build up a family life, and then set about destroying the very thing you cherish. All this, for your ego. The urges that you have to satisfy at any cost. Correct me if I am wrong. What have we here? Not only are you careless with your family, but you're also careless with your personal security. Ah, I think I deserve some payment. After all the therapeutic help I have been giving you. What do you think? - Do anything you want, I don't care. - Thank you, I will. To keep you company. Good day to you sir. Could I have some bananas? (heavy exhales) I have been thinking about your family. How I can make life better for them. I really feel I cannot let poor Louise deal with your issues alone. I can tell her about you inviting me into your home, letting me sleep in her daughter's bed. Your sexual assault on me. Do not worry. I decided not to report you to the police and press charges. How do you think Louise would feel about you sexually assaulting another man in her home? Actually, have you done this before? You invited a stranger into your home when the family's away? Well have you? I will take your silence to mean you have. Well, after this episode, I do not think you will be doing that again. - Fuck you. - One addiction I have cured you of. I have a solution for your gambling addiction. Would you like to hear it? It is very simple. I will not bother you, or your family if you just donate your gambling money to me. Look at it as charity. Your contribution to making the world a better place. What do you think? (doorbell rings) I wonder who wants to join the party. (tense music) - Oh, hi. Is Ben around? - And you are? - Sorry, I'm Jessie from next door. I used babysit for the family. Louise just asked me to pop round to check in on Ben, make sure he is okay. - Yes, he is fine. He is upstairs asleep. - Sorry, who are you? - Oh, my name is Andrew. I'm a friend of Ben's, we used to work together. He's letting me stay for a few days, catching up, having a few drinks. I think he may have overdone it a bit with the drinks. - Louise is really worried about him. Doesn't seem to be returning any of her calls. - I will tell Ben to ring her as soon as he is able to. You are welcome to come in and see him sleep. - Just tell him to ring his wife. She's worried. - Jessie, tell Louise not to worry. Ben has a very good friend who is taking good care of him. What nice neighbors you have. Jessie, your old babysitter. Apparently your wife asked her to look in on you, to see if you are alright. Shall we send her a text, to set her mind at ease? Everything is alright, do not worry. Cannot speak now, a bit tied up at the moment. Will speak soon. I love you. That will keep her quiet for a while. (Ben mumbling behind tape) What is it now? - I need to go to the toilet, I need to go for a poo. - You will have to control yourself. - I can't, I haven't been to the toilet in ages. I don't go now, I'll wind up doing it in my pants. - Can I trust you not to do anything stupid? - Yes. - Do I have your promise? - Yes, you have my promise. You have my word. (grunting) (choking) (pensive strings music) - Awake, you son of Satan. Awake and see the true face of God. Silence you hell hound. You vessel for the devil. If you say or do anything unwanted, this will plunged into your black eyes. And this is how your family will find you, tied to your bed in your underpants and with a knife in your heart. If you doubt the sincerity of my words, I urge to test me. - Please. - Please again. Your sham begging, your false conciliatory tone. Did you consider your action when you attacked me? Or spoke in profanity against the lord? This demon inside of you will not listen to reason. It has to be driven out and replaced with God's light in your putrid mind and body. - Please. (chanting in a foreign language) - Demon, I command you to leave this body. The lord commands you to leave this body. Demon, show thyself. You cannot hide from the bright light of the lord. He shall seek you, whichever depths of darkness you try to conceal yourself in. Come out Demon, Jesus our savior demands it. - Please stop. I'm not possessed. - The greatest trick the Devil has is to convince the possessed that they are not possessed. - Listen to me. - It is your demon I want to listen to. Talk to me demon. Let me hear your real voice, speak demon, speak. - There is no demon. (Ben crying out) - Pain is necessary to drive out the demon. Embrace the pain. - Please stop, please stop. - This demon is strong. He clings, and he hides. We must stay strong to defeat him. (chanting in Latin) Body of Christ. (chanting in Latin) Blood of Christ. - Please, let me go. - Stop your endless moaning. Can you not see, I am trying to help you? I am sorry father. I want to help you father, I want to do God's work. I am sorry to displease you. I am weak. I deserve punishment. Help me be strong. Demon, you do not know my strength. God's will shall prevail. Demon, you cannot hide from me. I will cut open this empty shell of vanity, and find you. - Balam, my name is Balam. - Where do you come from? - Everywhere. - Where do you come from? - Everywhere. - Where were you born? - In Hell. - Who is your master? - Satan. - What are you doing in the body of this man? - He is weak, he is vain, I come to exploit his weakness. - I, God's chosen voice, command you to leave this body. Balam, depart, depart, depart. - He's gone. - Depart! - He's gone. I am free. (heavy exhalation) - Do you take me for a fool? - No. - Am I a fool? - No, no, no. - I know you are still in there controlling this idiotic man. How long have you possessed this vessel? So now you take refuge in silence. Well the only way to drive you out is to cut you out. - Wait, thou shalt not kill. If you cut out the demon, I will also die. God wants you to kill an innocent? - Innocents die in the struggle against evil. This demon inside you must be killed. - Please I have a family. - You think of your family now. - I have been bad, vain and selfish. I promise to be a better person. - How? - By the will and strength God has bestowed in me. - You said you did not believe in God. - I was lapse, I have found God in my hour of need. Jesus, Jesus. - What if he is lying? He is tricking you. The disciples of the Devil will trick you. He is taking you for a fool. What if he is telling the truth? What if he is lying? You will fall into his trap. So many voices, so many voices. Please, father, make them stop. Stop the voices in my head, please. Help me find the one true voice, please. For the word of God is active and alive. (chanting in foreign language) It penetrates evil to divide it's soul and spirits. It judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart. Yes father, I will spread the word of God. I will do as you command. The word of God. (chanting in foreign language) What is to be done with this vessel for the Devil? This demon infested, foul smelling, putrid, corpse, stench of evil. I must rid the world of this evil stench. - Wait. I could do God's work. - How can you do God's work, you have the demon inside you? - I'm protecting innocent people by keeping the demon inside of me, I am protecting innocent people. God's people. - Explain yourself. - If you release the demon from inside me, it will find another host, an innocent soul. You know evil cannot be destroyed totally. It has to be fought against continuously. Isn't that our purpose? To fight evil? - Yes. - Demons don't die, they just move on to the next innocent soul. Help me to protect innocent souls by keeping the demon inside me, keeping it a prisoner inside my rancid body. Aren't we supposed to protect the weak and innocent? - Yes, we must protect the innocent. - Help me to serve God, help me to protect innocent souls. - Yes, I will help you. - Untie me. - Not yet. I have to cleanse you of your vanity. I have to make you strong. The gates of your vanity must be closed forever. - You have cleansed me of my vanity. - How will you keep shut your gates of vanity? - I will keep the demon locked behind the gates. You will hold the key. - How? - I will report to you every week. Daily. I'll place myself in your trusted hands. You'll be able to shut the gates if you see them open. - I want to be part of your family. Family, yes, that way I will know that you are being sincere. - I don't think that would be a good idea. - Yes, it is a good idea. That way I can be close to you. To make sure your demon stays contained. I may stay overnight if there is a need to. I may come in for a shower or a meal, if I need to. Is that alright? - Yes. - Good. If you go back on your word, I will destroy you. I will show your family who you really are. If you go to the police, I will tell them that you sexually assaulted me, your word against mine. Do you understand? - Mmm-hmm. - Get down on your knees, and ask God for forgiveness. Ben? - Forgive me father, for I have sinned. I repent all my sins. - Good. Now you know how far I can go. It took all of that to make you submit fully to me. Do not ever disobey me again. You belong to me now. (chirping birds) Perhaps, you can say grace? - I don't know the words. - Bless us, Oh Lord, for these your gifts which we are about to receive from your bounty through Christ our lord, Amen. - Now we can eat. You can have some coffee, if you want to continue to pollute your body. - Can I call my wife? - Alright. But, I will be listening. (ringtone) - Hello darling, it's me. - [Louise] Where have you been? - Nowhere. - [Louise] Why haven't you been returning my calls? - I've been ill. - [Louise] What's the matter? - I don't know, some sort of stomach bug, cold, virus thing. - [Louise] Yes, you do sound a bit off. - I've just been sleeping most of the time. - [Louise] We'll come back today. - No, don't, there's no need. I'm feeling better, and there isn't any point to giving it to the kids, would there? - [Louise] Okay, you sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. How are the kids? - [Louise] Oh, they're fine. Amy's glued to Facebook, Tom's made friends with a boy down the road. Oh, he's been so sweet, helping Mum. - How's your mum? - [Louise] You know, being Mum. I'm looking forward to coming home. - I can't wait to see you. I love you. - [Louise] I love you too. I'm sorry about getting heavy with you. - I'm sorry too. - [Louise] We will sort everything out, won't we? - Of course we will, I promise. - [Louise] Okay, look after yourself. - I will. See you Sunday. - [Louise] Yes darling, see you Sunday. - See, how your faith is helping you to get closer to your family? - Thank you. - Are they coming back on Sunday? I cannot wait to see them all. Perhaps you can have a family roast. Is that alright? - I was thinking we could introduce you slowly. - No Ben, it is best for me to meet them as soon as possible. - Whatever you think is best. - This is great. I appreciate all that you are doing to help me. I hope gradually we can be friends again. Sometimes, going through difficult times defines a friendship makes it stronger. That which does not destroy us, makes us stronger. Do you think not? - And as for the ego, it has become a fable, a fiction, a play on words. It has totally ceased to think, to feel, and to will. There are no spiritual causes at all, the whole of the alleged empiricism which affirmed them has gone to the Devil, that is what follows. And be it made a nice misuse of that empiricism, we have created the world on the basis of it as a world of causes, as a world of will, as a world of spirit. (chiming bell music) - C'mon, let us go upstairs. - I don't know-- - I thought you said you were not going to disobey me again? (jet engine) I will take the paint upstairs, bring me some water. In a cup. (ringing bells music) Water, the elixir of life. It was unfortunate I had to take this action with you. I want you to understand it was not an act of revenge on my part. I had to do it, for your own good. Do you accept what I am saying? It is important you accept it was your fault for our future relationship. Do you accept it? - Yes, I accept it. - You do not sound very convincing. - I accept it was my fault in provoking you. - [Andrew] And? - And I apologize. - Good, we can put this all behind us now. I will be a good friend to your family and to you as long as you give me your full cooperation to what we agreed. I want our family to go to church regularly from now on. I want to be a second father to your children. Spend quality time with Amy and Tom, get Amy to do something useful. I would like to take Tom fishing. Do you think he would like that? - You Bible bashing lunatic. - What? (squishing stabbing sound) - Did you think I would let you run my family? See how far I can go? You saw vanity. (rustling branches) (chirping birds) (chirping birds) (slow, sweet piano) (grunting and kissing) - Oh I am so glad to be home. What happened to your face? - Don't ask. - Oh please. - Oh, well we should go away more often. - Not having enough. Anyway, next time, I'm coming with you. How are my little darlings? Love you. - Love you too, Dad. - You okay darling? - Yeah, just happy to see my family. (chirping birds) (dangerous piano music)
