Come with me, Magie. I heard Prince Schwan has been visiting the first princess. Only twice, but yes. Until now, he hadn't visited her since childhood. Twice is enough. What ideas has His Highness put in her head? The first princess's personal guard is acting in a suspicious manner. Is Prince Schwan involved? I'm hard pressed to believe that he isn't somehow. At any event, I will have to report this to Privy Council President Qualm. Wait. My involvement is a regrettable misunderstanding. Once I've learned the truth from my aunt, I shall have Magie report to you. Qualm can wait until afterward. If what Schwan said is true, the Otus siblings will eventually become obstacles to our plan. My beloved daughter... I'd thought Schwan was the only one who stood in our way. Any complications must be seen to. Go to Badon. Perhaps the first princess intends to send assassins after the siblings? I merely shared my speculations. My aunt is a dreadful woman, so perhaps it is possible... She may do that. Once the snow stops, I shall visit her. By then, I may be too late, however. My aunt does as she pleases. If it happens, it happens. This is Magie. I have information regarding Miss Lotta. "ACCA: 13-Territory Inspection Dept."

Oh, she was the one who agreed to keep me company. May I ask you a favor? What would that be? I have three more trips, back-to-back. During that time, could you take Lotta out again, like for tea and such? That's fine by me, but are you sure I'm the best person? When she talks about her outings with you, she always seems very happy. I'm thinking of asking Knot and the others, too. Of course I don't mind. I'll ask those three which places Lotta might like. Thank you. You'll be on a long trip. Yes, the farthest one is first, Peshi District. From there, I'll fly to Yakkara, and then continue to Pranetta District. Jean, be careful. I'll be fine. Even among the masses, she stands out. She is undeniably of royal blood. The brother is currently not in Badon. We'll take care of the sister first. Wh-What's this about? Shh! You're with ACCA... Your life is in danger! Why? I don't know why, but you're in danger. And suspicious people were following you. A friend, who lives far away, told me. I'll have to send him a ton of sandwich bread as thanks. Let's take the subway to ACCA HQ. You'll be safe there. I don't really understand what's going on. It seems to be something that can't be made public. But I'll protect you! Thanks. It's them. Let's blend in with the people changing lines and get off. "Central Marketplace" We're at the Central Marketplace Station. "Bread/Jam" We're at the Central Marketplace Station. "Bread/Jam" "Bread/Jam" We can take the bus to the branch office, "Bread/Jam" "Bread/Jam" but they may have anticipated it. But they may have anticipated it. Maybe it'd be better if we went to my place to see what's happening. It's true that your apartment building has great security. But they know where it is. The café owner... Why aren't you in school? They're the same sweets that Jean brought me last time as a present! It's also a traditional sweet from Dowa. I'll make some tea. Take a seat. You said your friend lives far away. Where does he live? Dowa. I have a friend in Dowa who loves sandwich bread, too! He said he was really impressed by how soft the bread is here. My mom was also like that. I'm told she came from another district, and got into sandwich bread. I wonder if she was from Dowa, as well... They say Dowa, Kororée, and Suitsu have a lot of folks with blond or blue hair. My friend also has blue hair. Blue hair, huh? Hey, about this Dowan friend of yours-- Hey, my place is around the corner. Can we stop by, real quick? There's a back entrance. I want to change clothes. This uniform really sticks out. Don't play hooky too often, okay? Oh, my god... Oh, my god! I'll go change, so hang on. O-Okay. She really does look like her mother. She must be from Dowa... Miss Lotta's in danger? Assassins are heading your way. Assassins? I can't give you many details, but since you were kind to me in Badon, I'm giving you this information. How are you and Miss Lotta connected? No connection in particular. But if we are fortunate enough to see each other again, I would like to have another lively discussion about sandwich bread. Okay, I trust you. I'll protect Lotta! But why would her life be in danger? Jean's in Peshi District, and Nino's... He's busy. "Peshi District" They say this statue of the second princess watches over Peshi's waters from the harbor. "ACCA Inspection Department Peshi Branch Supervisor Passer"” watches over Peshi's waters from the harbor. Watches over Peshi's waters from the harbor. Well, the branch director and the district chief are waiting, Deputy Chief. I'll wait for you, while I fish here! Though my predecessor made the decision, the incident still shames me. Peshi District is still marred by the royal family's misfortune. “"Peshi District Chief Herring” Peshi District is still marred by the royal family's misfortune. "Peshi District Chief Herring" “"Peshi District Chief Herring” I did not wish to cause further damage to Peshi District's reputation. I did not wish to cause further damage to Peshi District's reputation. "Peshi District Branch Director Clam" That is why I could not offer "Peshi District Branch Director Clam" "Peshi District Branch Director Clam" to take responsibility for the train accident in the past. To take responsibility for the train accident in the past. How does Peshi District view ACCA? Do they feel it may as well not exist? No, ACCA must continue. Isn't there something you want to talk to me about? Let's hear it. Peshi District stands with you. Please become the next king of Dowa. Are you ready? Yeah. Oh, I should take some chocolate. It isn't a picnic, you know. Intruder alert. Intruder alert. It's them! I'll try to contact security on the first floor! Lotta, they're already here! Let's go. Oh, please don't break the windows. The wind will get in. We don't have time! Can the staff elevator make other stops than the ground floor? They may have others waiting downstairs. Yeah. Let's get to the basement machine room, and take the stairs up. The police department must have been notified, so I'm sure they'll dispatch a patrol car. But there's traffic at this time of day... I'm out of options. I'll ask someone I know for help. He'll look kind of shady, but don't mind him. Okay. But who were they, anyway? It's scary that we don't even know why. And Jean isn't here... I'll protect you. What's that alarm about? Is it a malfunction? As I thought, it's caused a huge commotion. Good timing, though. We can get out, using the crowd as cover. There he is! Good. Oh, the police are here, too. Really? Then it's better to go under their protection. Hey! Oh? I think he's a wanted fugitive. Wait! Hey! What the hell are they doing? Oh, well. Let's just-- We need you to get into the car. A traffic jam... There's no need to hurry. We have the target. Why me? It's your blood. You want... My blood? I don't think my blood type is anything unusual. We must extinguish one of the Dowa family bloodlines. Eh? Oh! I see. Huh?! I'm of royal blood? Yes, Your Highness. It is unfortunate that we must extinguish the life of someone so innocent, but it is an order-- Apologies, the crowd has made me ill. May I rest here a short while? Chief? Miss Lotta! What a relief. Oh. Why do people from Dowa have Miss Lotta? The black tie means that you work for the first princess, doesn't it? Hmm... I work for ACCA Headquarters' Inspection Department. How strange... We received no word that emissaries from the royal family would be visiting. I'll have to confirm this with Dowa Branch. Wait! Oh, you don't wish to make this public? You are welcome to go, if you release the Badon residents from your custody. Thank you, Chief. You're very welcome. You saved our lives. I'm sorry, Lotta. I wasn't strong enough. No need to apologize. You made me feel a lot better while it was happening. Thank you! So, what is actually going on? Oh... I don't really understand it, either... I'll check on the ACCA side. Once Jean returns from his audit, we'll have a proper chat. Okay. What were you doing here, Chief? I was going to ask if you wanted to go for lunch. Would you like to come, as well? My staff will be joining us. Let's all go! The more, the merrier. I'm happy to accept, then. Please don't tell anyone else about that. Okay. I'm sharing a secret with Lotta! "Director-General's Office" "Director-General's Office" We've received a report from the Inspection Department We've received a report from the Inspection Department that "emissaries from the royal family" were acting strangely in Badon District. Forward the report to the Five Chief Officers, also. So the royal family has finally learned that Otus has royal blood, after it's been rumored for six months, across the districts? Anything else? An emergency meeting of the Five Chief Officers tomorrow, at two o'clock. I see. If things do not go as planned, what then? Deputy chief, this is a gift from the district chief. His secretary brought it here. Starting tomorrow, you'll be in Yakkara District? Yeah. How nice! "Peshi Departures" How nice! "Peshi Departures" "Peshi Departures" That district is the top choice among supervisors! "Peshi Departures" "Peshi Departures" Yakkara guys are really nice, Yakkara guys are really nice, though they're all bums. Thank you for coming. Welcome to Yakkara. "ACCA Inspection Department Yakkara Branch Supervisor Falco" Welcome to Yakkara. "ACCA Inspection Department Yakkara Branch Supervisor Falco" "ACCA Inspection Department Yakkara Branch Supervisor Falco" So, there are two routes to the branch office. "ACCA Inspection Department Yakkara Branch Supervisor Falco" "ACCA Inspection Department Yakkara Branch Supervisor Falco" Which would you prefer? "ACCA Inspection Department Yakkara Branch Supervisor Falco" I'll leave it up to you. Heads, we take the right route... Tails. We'll take the left route, then. They've really embraced the local culture... When a place is this unique, you have no choice but to embrace it. That's what this nation's about, isn't it? There are 13 unique characteristics, and we respect them. That's one of our national virtues. "5 Chief Officers' Meeting Room" Today, it seems we'll finally hear what's going on. Please begin, Chief Officer Grossular. I will tell you about Jean Otus. As you all must have heard, via various channels, there is a rumor that the man is of royal blood. I first heard it right after our initial decision to terminate the Inspection Department. Upon investigation of that rumor, I found it to be true. As you well know, "Dowa Kingdom" "Dowa Kingdom" in recent years, "Dowa Kingdom" "Dowa Kingdom" each district has been suspected of having pro-coup elements. "Dowa Kingdom" I believe there should be a coup, spearheaded by ACCA. I suggested the Inspection Department's termination to minimize any obstacles for those working toward a coup. However, then I learned that an Inspection Department member, Otus, was of royal blood. I decided using him was more strategically sound, so I agreed to allow the Inspection Department to continue. Then, your claim to information that Otus was acting as an intermediary between sympathizers was... Correct. I did not obtain that information. I created the rumor that Otus, who is of royal blood, sought districts that shared "his" goals. Once Otus was situated as an intermediary, I assigned Crow, from Internal Affairs, to observe him, so Crow could report how each district's notable figures reacted to the rumor. I want you all to think hard about this. Prince Schwan, soon to be King Schwan, wishes to abolish ACCA and create an autocracy. To prevent his ascension, and to preserve order, we will trigger a coup d'état. Otus is an upright individual, who desires to preserve peace in this nation. If he is the next king, the nation will continue to be at peace. But because he is no longer on the Dowa family register, we cannot achieve that by normal means. That is why I linked him to the coup movement, to garner sympathizer support for his claim to the throne. This is for the future of ACCA. What say you all? This poses no danger to the people. ACCA serves to protect the people, and ACCA will lead the coup d'état. Chief Officer Grossular, why didn't you present this plan to us at the very beginning? I had to first observe how each district felt about a potential coup. Only once the majority of districts supported a coup could it even be a possibility. And that has come to pass. Chief Officer Lilium, do you find my argument unsatisfactory, as usual? No. I side with Chief Officer Grossular. I agree. This is the first time the two of you have agreed on something, isn't it? Some aspects of the plan require further refinement, but ACCA's continued existence safeguards this nation's future. And if this is the only means of protecting ACCA... What do the rest of you think? This means that ACCA will take the lead in the coming coup, right? Your opinions have aligned... I see no reason to object. As long as I can protect Suitsu's beautiful scenery, I have no preference. And you, Chief Officer Spade? It's true, I would take no pleasure in standing by, while that idiot prince ascends. Then, let's stake our bet on preserving ACCA. Chief Officer Grossular, you started us down this path. I'd hope that you would not try to take back the cards you laid on the table. I merely dealt the cards. See? Nothing to worry about. Though, perhaps "I merely dealt the cards" was a tad much, Chief Officer Grossular. Let's have a toast. Didn't things proceed just as I said? It was simple, yes? This is why I opposed you at every turn before those three. There's no need to look at me that way now. From now on, we have to stay in agreement, remember? We must make this an entertaining game. Otherwise, Chief Officer Spade and the others will tire of it. Ensuring Director-General Mauve stays quiet is our next step. That will be the most difficult challenge of all. We'll manage. I wonder. You... will manage. She will listen to you. Am I wrong? It will be fine. Don't worry, Chief Officer Grossular. You merely need to do as I say. As you begin to doze off I quietly nestle closer to your shadow All I can hear is the pulse of love And your sleeping breaths Do you know? The words of my question to you Are so fragile, they scatter and disappear Do you mind? Is it all right if I feel this way?
