You know something? Jack-- You've been dating the boss's daughter for 3 months, I know it, the department head knows it. Even human resources knows it. It's just dating. Yeah, but that could change, right? I mean, aren't things getting serious? I mean, you know... Well, there you go. As long as that possibilities out there, nobody's gonna block your promotion.

Mmmm 200 last count. Surprised we even know 200 people. (small chuckles) Don't be silly, they're all our friends, they'd be devastated if they weren't invited.

Now, the events manager at the Clarendon's going to be devastated. But, I told her I thought the hotel had been cutting corners on food last year. I notice those sorts of things. I bet you do. You seem like the kind of person who's passionate about the details. Exactly. You can't take your eye off anybody for a second. Now, naturally, you're invited this year, Jack. Unless you're going home for the holidays. No, no, Kansas is a little far for a 4-day weekend. Oh, good. Demi'd be devastated if you couldn't make it.

Are you an item? Do you have an understanding? Have you plated your troth? ...Whatever that means. No. Then she can go out with other guys, you date other women. Yeah, just a couple of times.

Good, I was hoping you could sort of, maybe, just... teach me tonight if you have time. (laughs) It's not really something you learn in one class. Oh, it's not just kind of moving around to music? Yeah, and learning the piano is just pressing down on those black and white things with your fingers. Point taken. How long will it take? Well that depends, do you want to learn to foxtrot, samba, salsa, waltz...? Actually, they all kind of look a little silly. Why do you wanna take dance lessons? I need to dazzle people at a Christmas party. Why don't you learn some card tricks? That's funny. Listen, I teach ballroom dancing. If you wanna learn how to dance, give me a shout. Otherwise, I'm in the middle of a lesson. Sorry, I didn't mean to get off on the wrong foot. I need to learn to waltz. Okay, would you like to learn a specific routine?

And how do I do that? Put your arms up. Okay, now put some tension in these tennis-toned arms. Very impressive. Kay, and we call this tension tone. Now walk forward. How'd you do that? (laughs) (laughs) Now if you keep your frame right, and you get a little springiness in your step, then I have no choice but to walk backwards. Okay. (laughs) Good, okay, so you understand tone. Now, the waltz step is in a box step, it's in the counts. One, two, three. One, two, three... One, two, three. You step on every count. You step forward with your left foot, and I'm gonna step back.

So, I was talking to Mrs. Leifshutz You remember her? No. Sure you do! Mrs. Leifshutz No I, I don't remember a Mrs. Leebshuts. Mrs. Leif-SHUTZ. Uh, whatever mom I-- I don't remember. You can say it 100 times but I'm not gonna remember it. What about her? So, I was talking to her and she said that it was so sad that this was the first Christmas since your father's passing and that we were going to spend it apart. I know mom, I'm sorry. I have been meaning to visit and come back. No, no, no! That's okay, I understand. You're in a new job and working all the time, but I'm just kicking around at home doing nothing, so, that started me thinking and I used to surprise you with some Christmas presents when you were a little boy so I decided to, surprise you again! Well, you certainly did! You don't have any decorations up. Yeah I have that. What is that? That's my tree. Deconstructed. Demi gave it to me. Well-- She's not the, uh, sentimental type is she. Avant garde you know that's, that's her thing. If you're into art or creative stuff she's your person. Uh huh. That's very impressive. It is. Yeah, isn't it? She's amazing. She's on the board of several museums, she put together this, this orchestra for these inner city kids, who had nothing. Yeah, she's incredible. Well I'd-- I'd love to meet her. Oh, she's so beautiful, I mean she's-- she could be a movie star if she wanted to, I'm telling you. Jacky, you don't have to sell me. No, I'm-- I'm not! So, um, I'm assuming that she's going to be a part of the um, the family? Yeah. I mean, yeah at some point. Well, you know we have been seeing each other. Seeing a lot of each other. Mmm hmm. Well then? I haven't asked her. Well, are you going to? Yeah definitely, I mean I-- you know I'm, I think so. Prob-- Soon. Jacky you know I've never heard you sound like this before. I mean you always knew what you wanted and went after it I mean, that's one of the things that I always admired about you. Actually, mom I'm a little confused about a couple of things lately. I just don't know what to think. Well, what does your heart tell you? My heart? Yes! Your heart! Jacky we're talking about love here. You can't think your way through this. Do you love Demi? We have a great time together mom. We're very... She's charismatic, she's cultured, she's beautiful sexy, I mean, yeah, we have a great time together. Why are you hesitating? Okay, enough analysis, mom. Okay, okay. Do it your way. Eventually I'll realize that you were right all along, right? Why don't you let me take you out to dinner tonight? Alright, great. Oh, no I can't, I have a, uh, dance lesson tonight. Well, you are full of surprises. No, it's just for the company Christmas party I have to learn to dance. Oh! Oh, wait, I have the perfect thing for you to wear! Oh, mom I hope it's not one of those... Oh, mom. (laughs) Isn't it beautiful? Where do you get these things year after year? Mrs. Leifshutz knits them! Poor thing she doesn't have a lot to do and she likes to keep busy. Mom, I-- I'm not really sure how to break this to you but, I don't still really wear that kind of thing. People who appreciate Christmas, do. ♪ Feel the rise and fall. It's a lot to remember. You shouldn't even have to remember. Your body should just do it automatically. I'll try. Don't even try. Just let it happen. Your brain's gettin' in the way. Turn your brain off. Every time I've turned my brain off I've gotten in trouble. Hi there, can I help you? No-- no, I'm just watching. Mom! What are you doing here? Well, I um, I found this card on the table and uh, I figured this is where you must be. So, um, I was taking my evening walk anyway so, I thought I'd come and cheer you on. Yeah...I forgot about the old evening walk. (laughs) Are you going to introduce us? Mom, this is Christine, my dance instructor. Christine this, is my mother. Call me Jessica. Very nice to meet you Jessica. Likewise! So, how is Jacky doing? Uh, Jacky is doing very well. Gee I haven't been to a parent teacher interview for years! Well, in that case, um, Jacky's a delight to have in the classroom. He dresses very well. He's polite and he plays well with others. (laughs) Christine would you join us for dinner tomorrow? I'll cook. I thought we were going out, mom? I changed my mind. I think we should just have a nice holiday dinner. I would love to! I mean, if that's okay with you... Sure, that's-- that's great. Wonderful. Shall we say seven? Seven sounds great. Great. Goodnight, mom. Thank you. ♪ Jacky? And-- (laughs) No, no, I just... I just wish you'd asked, before you invited her over, that's all. Why? Are you ashamed of where you live? No, of course not. I just thought... Surprise! Do you remember these decorations? You-- you brought them all with you. Well, there wasn't any point in decorating my house if I wasn't going to be there. Oh! And I went out and got a little tree, after you'd gone to your class. I'm sorry it's so small but it's the best I could manage. No, it's... It's beautiful. You know what-- Why don't we put this away. But if Demi comes over it comes back out. Now, it's beginning to feel like Christmas! It sure is. Let me ask you a question, Jack. You like this place? Oh! It's the hottest restaurant in town! People love coming here! Do you like it? Personally? I don't really like any restaurant where the plate is heavier than the food. Well, I couldn't agree more. Don't know why I brought us here, force of habit. You like it? I loathe it! (laughs) Did you know I was born and raised in Gary, Indiana? No-- I always thought that you were... Native New Yorker, family's been here for generations. Yes. Well, that's no accident, I've worked at that but no, I started out with, nothing but ambition. And um, somehow Clarice spotted me, my rugged good looks I guess. And we got serious, and she introduced me to the right people and I made sure those introductions paid off. Well, you're also great at what you do. True. But skill isn't always enough. And you're gonna have to do the same thing Jack. Demi will insist upon it. And get used to places like this. You'll be eating in a lot of them. Crush that social circle. Stay there long enough, and people will forget you're from Kansas. I'm not sure that I want them to. Oh, yeah you do. This is a very small world you're moving into. We all know each other, we're all we want to know. Listen, you could be very happy. You'll have a lovely home, a beautiful fascinating wife, a full social calendar, and the ability and potential to make more money than you'll have ever dreamt possible. That's the deal Jack. And I just thought you should be aware of the details before signing up. I appreciate it. Are you happy, sir? Clarice and I make a, good team. I live a comfortable life, I've gotten everything I could have asked for. If that's what you want Jack go for it. Demi's mother and I will not stand in your way. We'll leave that decision totally up to you two. Thank you, sir. Let's have some dessert. (doorbell) Hello. Hi. Come in. Oh! Oh, thank you! Mom, Christine is here! Christine! Oh, hello. So glad you could come! Thank you. Oh my! What a beautiful sweater! Oh! I love it when people know how to embrace the holiday. Well, Christmas is my favorite time of the year. Can you believe I have an entire closet full of sweaters just like this one. Oohh! I'm really glad that you invited me. Um, I brought you a little something. Oh! Thank you, that's so nice of you! It's nothing it's just a, Christmas ornament. It's a Christmas lovebird. My father bought it years ago and we always hung it on the tree. You don't like it. No, uh, um, your father couldn't have bought just this one bird. Well, yes, he did. No, they were only sold in pairs. Come with me! You see I uh, I bought a pair of these for the first Christmas that Jack's father and I spent together, and one of them broke a couple of years ago and I was heartbroken and now, the lovebirds are together again. You did good! And his father was standing in the middle of the department store surrounded with this new video equipment trying to get a magic memory on tape and and Jacky is screaming, I mean screaming in terror, on Santa's lap! (laughs) Look, Santa can be very scary. How old were you? Second year in college? No! You must have been, no, you were much younger than that. You must have been around... Joking, mom. Just joking. Oh. Whatever. Anyone for coffee?! That would be great. Good! Be right back. Your mom is lovely. Yeah. She is. She loves to laugh. I see. I still can't get over the lovebird. I know! That's freaky, right?! If it was, passed down to you from your father you sure you won't miss it? No, I've got a trunk full of ornaments that he left me. And if that lovebird can make somebody else happy then they should have it. Oh, believe me, it made my mother very happy. Then it did what a Christmas present should do. Is Demi as nice as Christine? What? Is Demi as nice as Christine? Look mom that's, I dunno that's like apples and oranges. Well, they're both young women aren't they? Yes. Then you should be able to give me a simple yes or no. Okay then yes, she is. Well then, when can I meet her? I dunno I'll try and set something up. Why is it that difficult? No it's, it's not difficult, it's just, she's busy. Does she work? Nope. What's she so busy doing? I dunno she's just busy. Ugh, how well do you know this girl? Mother! It's a legitimate question. You hinted that maybe you're going to propose, I'm just asking how well do you know the girl? I know her very well. She's a beautiful woman, you'll love her. Well let me meet her. Goodnight. ♪ I am stuffed. I couldn't eat another bite! Well, maybe they'd let you take it home in a hamster bag. (laughs) Oh! That is too funny! (laughing) Oh, that's great! What are you doing? Oh, I'm tweeting what you said to all my friends. You're just so precious! Oh. Thanks. Now I know where Jack gets his sense of humor. You've gotta meet my mom! She's a total riot! Really? Oh, she cracks 'em up at the club. Well, I look forward to meeting her. Mommy? Yeah, hi, I'm having lunch with Jack's mother. The one from Kansas, yes! Okay, she has to come to the Christmas party, she is an absolute riot, you'll love her! Okay. Are you staying at Jack's house? Yes. Yes, she's staying at Jack's. Okay. She's gonna messenger you an invitation later today. Oh, well that's not really necessary. Okay love you, kisses! (kissing sound) (laughs) Oh. Mother said she's thrilled she said she'd be absolutely devastated if you couldn't make it. Aw, well I don't really have the appropriate clothing, so. Shopping? Not a problem! I know exactly where to take you! Can we get the check? Hey. How's it going? Yup. Fine. Keeping my head above water. Barely. I knew it'd be a lot of work. She hasn't given up yet? I have a whole file of her letters. She's written to everybody involved in the project. It's not gonna do any good. No, it is not. Nothing she can do is gonna stop it. And there's nothing I can do either. Order of eviction. Well, that makes things real now doesn't it? Yeah. Trombley set the date for December 24th. Christmas Eve. Oh. Sentimental, isn't he. Least I could do is lose the paperwork. That oughta buy her a few weeks. Well, I guess that's some sorta Christmas present. Yep. You gotta tell her man. ♪ ♪ Mom? You okay? What's wrong? ♪ Oh, that's beautiful! I know. S-- So, what's the problem? Whoa. I know. I've never spent so much on a dress in my entire life. I could have the house painted for that. Mom, don't worry, I'll-- I'll give you the money for it. No, I have the money Jacky I just don't feel right spending that much money on one article of clothing. Then... why'd you buy it? Demi! She took me from one store to another, and all the clerks knew her. And, and they brought me dress after dress and after a while it just became a big blur I didn't know what I was doing anymore. Finally, she took me to this one store and she found this dress and she said it was "Totally me" and that she would be absolutely devastated if I didn't wear it to the Christmas party. She invited you to the Christmas party. Yes! And there was rock music Christmas carols blaring in my ear and they put the, the charge slip in front of me and I signed it, then we ended up in this lounge where I had something called cosmos and then I ended up back here and I, somehow, and... It was just all one big blur. Well. You'll look great in the dress. I am taking it back. Why? Because! It's just-- it's too expensive. It's just not me! Ah, it's just a dress mom. No, it isn't. It would be like I'm changing myself to get the approval of people I don't even know. People I don't even care about. And-- and maybe I'm being a little hard on Demi but really she spends an awful lot of time worried about what people think of her. No, I'm gonna just, take it back and I'll find something else to wear to the party. Mom, as a favor to me, would you let me buy it for you? Demi is gonna, expect to see you in it. Oh, no. She won't even notice. No! Mom-- (laughs) She will. Look, it's a different world here mom! Remember when I was a teenager and I used to do deliveries for dad? And I would go to those, well, I thought they were mansions and I would stand on the front stoop with my paper bags and sometimes I would just wait a few minutes before I rang the bell and I would just, look at the big house and the manicured lawn and the, expensive cars in the driveway and... I just wanted to be a part of that world. Your father and I did the best we could. No! No, mom. You guys were the greatest parents imaginable. Look, I know how hard it was to put me through college and... the sacrifices that you made. It wasn't a sacrifice! I know that it was. And you gave me unconditional love the greatest gift possible. And I need just, one more little gift! Even though you don't believe in it, I need your help. Please. But it's just so expensive! Hey! I wore your sweater. (laughs) Well, Demi does have good taste! Doesn't she?! So, you'll keep it? If you think she'll be insulted. Oh! It is beautiful! Hi. Hi, Jack. Are you ready? Yeah, I'll just get this off. You okay? Yeah-- Oh yeah, it's just been a long day. I have a lot of long days too, but, I don't usually end up crying. What's the matter? I just realized I'm gonna be outta here in two weeks. I'm not gonna win. I went to talk to a lawyer this afternoon. He's an old friend of my fathers. And I showed him my notes from the phone calls that I've been making and, you know what he said. He said to do nothing. In the movies the little guy always wins. But I guess in real life it's the guy with the biggest bank account that wins. This is my home Jack. I used to do my homework here. At a little desk right there. My father hung these mirrors when we first moved in. My mom was pretty sure that he didn't know what he was doing. I guess he did, huh. They fell down twenty minutes later. (laughs) They had to call in a carpenter to fix everything and... my mom was so upset. And he just, took her by the hand, and he walked her out into the middle of the dance floor, and they just started to move. I can still see them dancing. Dancing made them feel better, huh? Eddie said it was their therapy. Well, then... ♪ Wow. You felt that. I could tell. Yeah I-- I certainly wasn't thinking anything. And yet you did everything perfectly. Congratulations, Jack.

Okay then, well then, thank you. Uh, yeah, okay. Uh, well, good luck. It was a real pleasure teaching you. Oh. Right, okay. Um... Thanks. Okay. ♪ Uh, I-- I forgot my gloves. Uh, I don't remember seeing your gloves. Oh... Ah! There they are. Ah, wouldn't wanna lose those.

Well, I wouldn't worry too much about it, I mean, not to say that your work isn't important, but things have a way of working themselves out. Not like life, huh. I'm sorry, honey? Oh, sorry mom, just-- just venting. Jacky, come and sit by me. C'mon. C'mon. You know your dad worried about you something awful. He did? Yes! Moving so far away from home. I mean this place is like a, another planet. Don't you laugh at me you know I'm right. Oh, you're right. You're right. And he always knew that you would, be a success at whatever you decided to do but after you'd been here for a few years he worried that you were, maybe spinning your wheels a little. I was.

Um, I think I'm gonna start with the waltz, um-- Which many people say is the most romantic of all the dances. So, I think that the best way to start is just to, show you how it's done and then, we'll break it down after that. Does anyone wanna volunteer? Anyone? Um, okay, I'll just pick someone. Uh, anybody? How about, um, you? Sir. Go, Jack! Oh yeah! Go! (clapping) This is your Christmas party? It's a business thing. I just found out these are the people tearing down my studio. What are you doing here?

No, no, please, I was trying... Who is this woman, Jack? Obviously nobody of any importance. Demi-- Very important to cool down after dancing. What is going on?

What explanation could you possibly have? You flat out lied to me. I didn't mean to. Of course you meant to. You did it. But I didn't-- I didn't know what else to do. What? Telling the truth was never an option? No. I mean yes of course I could've-- Christine, I got caught up. I got caught up in the deal and then when I met you I didn't... I didn't wanna hurt you. Because when we danced I never felt anything like that... In my life. When I went to tell you every time I would picture you walking out of my life forever and I couldn't do that. So, I didn't say anything. You expect me to believe that? You've lied to me since, pretty much the beginning. And now suddenly you're telling the truth? Yeah. And you're afraid that I'm gonna walk out of your life forever? Yes. Well your fears are well founded. You should go because I have to pack. Well you don't need to pack. Now you're just being cruel. No, you don't need to leave the studio. Jack I can't take any more of your lies, okay? No, the box you gave me, I-- there was a lease in it. Well not a lease exactly but an agreement between your father and somebody named Louis Bertoli. Mr. Bertoli was my father's best friend. And he was the owner of this building but... I looked through that box and there was no agreement. It's on the back of this photo, it was easy to miss. What does it say? It's a co-operative agreement between the two men, saying that 5% of each month's rent would go towards purchasing the property and that would be completed in thirty years. My father moved in here 35 years ago. Well, you over paid. But the point is-- the point is that you own the studio. Why wouldn't the management company or the owners say anything? Maybe they just didn't know, It's crazy two guys writing a contract like that on the back of a photograph but it's binding. I think that'll hold up in court. Does this kill the development deal? If you want it to. I mean they're gonna come after you with a lot of money. (laughs) I would rather have my studio. Jack. This means your big promotion is... Ah, well, there was no future for me at that firm so... That's not right. Anyway it's done, I already emailed a copy of the agreement to Trombley so, he'll get that on boxing day. Probably not the present he's looking for. And the deal going south that's the end of Demi and I but that-- that wasn't gonna happen anyway. So, what are you gonna do? I don't know. I'll figure something out. I mean there's-- there's something you could do to help ease the... painful transition period. Okay. Anything. Yeah, it's very bright in here isn't it? We could turn these lights down a bit. (laughs) Ah, yeah. Do you have any music? Maybe or something? ♪ How's that? Does that work? Ahh.
