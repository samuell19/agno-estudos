Good. Yeah, fine. Okay. Line up! What happened? And I don't wanna hear, "Mike got hit over the head with a cricket bat." Oh, I think he failed to wax off, sensei. What Mr. Miyagi is trying to say, high blocks and leg sweeps will only get you so far. You have to commit to the attack. Okay, free training. Mikey! - That was awesome! - Oh, thanks man. Except for the part you chickened out. Oh. Good to see the message of self defense isn't wasted on you. Why do you think Mark wants you out there? He wants to see you kicking ass. Oh okay. Hey, you know that wooden dummy - that I'm gonna make? - Yeah. Yeah, it's gonna look just like you. You're gonna need some sexy trees, huh? Hey! Oi, where you going? Oi, you training tomorrow? No, I can't. I gotta work. You scared of this? And this. - No, no. I'm good, man. - You could be great, Mikey! Don't forget to wax off, Mike. Oi Miyagi! Get over here! Sorry. Hello. I have been waiting such a long time for this. Tonight is my night. You are sure about that? Yeah, you're right. The red. Not that. I just got word that Eddie's back in town. And you know how much the boss loves Eddie. Fuck off. That'll never happen. I'm just saying. Go get the car. You're not due for another half an hour. Yeah. Go the red. Brings out your eyes. Cheers. Down. Bend up. Hold. And bend. Breathe out and bend down. That's great. Oi. Just give me five minutes. - I almost got ya. - No you didn't. - Boom! I did then. - Oh, okay. - That's for perving on my class. - What? No, no, doesn't count. - What? - Well-- only counts if they're hotter than you. Excuse me? Oh, no, no-- It wasn't-- I didn't mean it-- Come on, Sara. We've gotta get moving. You know how much - I love night driving. - Yeah. Oh, whoa man. You hear that? The weather's gonna be horrible up north. - Look, I've got a better idea. - Mm-hmm? Why don't you skip the workshops-- No, no, no, just drop the workshops and you can just hang out with me. You know, we could have some PlayStation, paintball, pizzas. - Yeah. Tempting, but no. - No? No. Okay. Gotta go. I'll call you when I get there. - Love you. - You too. We're here. Always a pleasure, Flick. Do say hello to Manson for me. Bitch! Oh, where the fuck am I? Oh, you crafty f... So I moved the shields to the side but the veneers didn't show up. Okay, thanks mate. Have a good night. Oh yeah, what time do you want me to come in tomorrow? I'm not gonna need you now. - What? - Well, if the wood ain't sharp, there's not a lot you can do. Dude, I need those hours. Sorry Mike. Not a lot I can do about it. All right. That's okay. I understand. Meet next week. Goddamn it. Guy ripped me off. Whoa, whoa! Nice one, caballero. Oh yeah? Yeah, says the guy outta nowhere. Ed? Sorry, mate. You've got me mistaken. No, no, no man. You're not getting away that easy. I recognize that ugly mug anywhere. I don't know who you are. Fu... - Sorry about your board, man. - Hey, hey, hey. Come on, man. - Come on. I know it's you... - What? ...all right? I promise I won't make fun - of your pretty hair. - You're probably concussed, man. Just go home! Forget this-- any of this ever happened. E-- Damn it! Ed! Shit. Not my phone. What are you playing at? Now where'd you go? Oh shit. Sir, I'm all for being fair, but how much longer are we going to wait around? - Completely un-- - Hey, hey. - Sorry guys. Sorry I'm late. - See? He can't even turn up for a meeting on time. Yeah, well, no thanks to you. Something you'd like to share, Edward? No please. Don't hold back on my account. You know I would love to indulge your petty ego, man. But I'm sure that everyone here has better things to do than listen to another tale of your inability to finish up this problem. Is that really the best you can do? I've heard better comebacks from... Well, it's good to know there's still one place - girls won't reject you. - Oh, I'm not the one that has a problem. The only lady I have a problem with is you. You started as nothing. And you'd be nothing without me. Fuck you, minor. - Fucking hotshot. - You'd be dead without me, - Al Capone. Yeah. - Is that right? You know what, sir, it's a matter of class. I rode a BMW here tonight, he rode what? - Yes, all right you two. - Judging by the look of things, - I'd say it's a... - Pack it in. I did not invite you here for a pissing contest. Nice pants. As you might be aware... following some complications, we're in need of a new chapter head. Yes, we are. And as you know, we nearly lost the Solomon deal to the Kiwis because this prick decided to improvise. Under my control, I will personally guarantee that this sort of thing will never happen again! - Huh? - Look, what's the point of killing anybody if you can't have fun doing it? Like any profession, killing takes a little bit of creativity. Look, in my ex-- Shh! In the end, things don't always go to plan - but I have managed to always-- - Yeah, alright... All of what you just said... - You make a good point. - Members only. I've got you. Fuck! - I know how to use this. - You better. The decision of this counsel is absolute. Congratulations, Eddie. I don't fucking believe-- Hey, what the-- Oi! Get your guns up. Cover him. Easy, buddy. Whoa, whoa! Settle! Hey everybody. Whoa! Tony, tony, he's with me. Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. This is Michael. We all know he shouldn't be here right now. But, um... he's one of my associates and he wants in. Uh, well, look we-- I did tell him to wait outside, but, uh, what can I say? He's a keen bean, boss, um-- What better to start my new career than by replenishing the ranks, eh? You've gotta be fucking kidding me. This guy falls in from the roof? He could be a fucking cop! He could be anything! Hey, I told you he's with me. He's gonna be okay. He's gonna be good, huh? - Yeah, he's gonna be good. - Yeah, the best. Best. - Come on. - Boss. He's good muscle. Yeah. Yup. Come here. Are you serious? You're gonna let him walk? While I get reamed with a set of fucking kitchen knives! - Come on! - You better make sure they glow, you don't want those inferior things - up your ass, Manson. - Fuck you! This is bullshit! - If you just-- - Shut up! Shut up! - But I won't-- - Shut the fuck up! You're lucky I don't fucking kill you, man. Come on. You gotta be kidding me. - Calm down, all right? - Don't touch me. What the fuck, man? You-- What the fuck happened? Until ten minutes ago, I thought your decapitated corpse was rotting somewhere in the middle - of the fucking desert. - Seriously, mate. Do you have any idea how close you were to getting your fucking head blown off in there? Oh, no chance, man. I kicked that dude's ass. Oh yeah, yeah, and what about the rest of them? - Ed? - What are you gonna do? Try the dazed and confused approach? - Ed? - Listen, if I don't spin some serious shit and we go right now, - we are fucking both dead. - Ed! You've been dead for a decade. It hasn't done you any harm. You have no idea what I've been doing. - I did what I had to do. - Bullshit. Bullshit! Mate. You know what? You don't wanna tell me? Fine. All right? But what about your family? Huh? Yeah, your mum was a wreck. And your dad? Your dad, he was all like crying and shit and there was the funeral. And all those people who-- Hold it. My dad really cried? - No. Not really. - Man. All right, all right. - How far did I fall? - Not far enough, man. Eddie. I gotta go. - This. Not over. - Hey, hey, hey. - What do I do? - Go home. For real this time. - I'll be in touch. - Well, what if you're not?

No, "Thanks - for saving my life yesterday"? - Hey, hey, hey, how about you stop screwing with me, Ed? Okay. Several of my associates from last night want to kill you. What? Yes. Lucky for you, I'm a fantastic liar and I've bought us some time by telling them you'd be a good man to have around. What does that mean? It means that someday soon you'll be asked to do us a favor. - How soon? - Today. Damn it, Eddie! I-- Hey, you fell into the wrong room, my friend. Members only. No loose ends. Them the rules. It was the only thing I could do to save your life. I thought you might like it that way better than dying. No. No man, no entirely. My life plan didn't include owing the mob some kind of favor. Hey, hey. Club, - Mikey, the Club. - The Club, whatever is it, man. I'm guessing if I don't help you kill someone, I'm dead. Is that it? That's it, isn't it? - No man. - I'm dead. I'm dead, man. No, no. You read too many comic books, man. The Club is like a massive organization. Only a select few are killers. Besides... I told them that you're only a prospect. All right? Now we just make it look like you're not a very good one. Huh? You're gonna be fine, man. I got your back. - What do you want me to do? - Nothing. Just want you to come with me when I pick up my ride. - Got any wheels? - Yeah. Plenty. Just what are we doing here anyway? Shouldn't we be back at the yard? After what went down last night, that's shit's going to have to wait. Okay... and what if the boss finds out about this situation? And how would he do that, exactly? Believe me. Edward's like a cartoon nappy. It's cool on the outside, but inside he's full of shit. Here we go. And about time. You, uh, you sure you're up for this? Some things you never forget.

I'm going to need something to drink soon. There's a 7-Eleven at the end of this block. My money's at home. I've got five bucks. I can buy you a slurpy. Hey, guys. - How you doing? - Hey. Yeah, all right. Yeah? You guys skating today? - Yeah. - Yeah, later on. You too? Where's your helmet? At home. So you're going to skate without a helmet? - Uh, guess so. - really? A couple of likely boys. What do you think? Mm-hmm. Just gagging for it. I... Hey boy! She was just all over me like a fly on a turd. Crazy. Need you to do something for me, big man. - I'm listening. - Mm. Well, try this one. See how it fits. That doesn't feel too bad, does it? Just clip that. There you go. - Perfect. - Hey, what are you guys up to? Is this your sister? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah, she hasn't got a helmet. - She always forgets. Well, she can borrow this for now. - Come on, sis. Time to go. - It's T-Dog. Let's get out of here. Come on. Come on. Let's go! Hey, hey! That's my helmet! Oi you! You're in our lot. Yeah? That'll be 20 bucks for the helmet. Whoa! Man, this thing is huge! Hey! Hey, hey man! Don't ollie on that. - You got a smart mouth. - What? - Wait a sec, guys. - Nah, mate. You wait a sec. That was fucking rude. - Yeah, T-Dog! - Come on, T. - Snap him, T. - Yeah, T. - Smash him up. - Come on. Fuck him up, T-Dog. Now look, if you don't have the money, you can just pay me another time. - Slice him up. - I wouldn't do that if I were you. Oh, geez! - Drop the knife, mate. - Fuck! Broke my fucking shoulder. Yeah, well, you tried to kill me, man. - I think we're even. - Fuck you! What are you pussies waiting for? Get him! - Kid's got skills. - Yeah... how about that? What are you waiting for, man? Get in. Come on. Come on. Buckle up! Wasn't that K-Z's ride? Shit man! Dude! What was that, man? What? You saw that? What happened to you? What happened to "I got your back"? Clearly, you don't need my help, mate. Problem is, I'm not the only one watching, Mikey. What? What, we're being watched? I didn't see anyone. And you won't. But that little display back there is gonna help the others think that you're legit. I mean, even if that dude did need his ass handed back to him by the real Kung Fu master, man. So, uh... what do we do now? - We? There is no we, Mike. - Yeah. I'm taking you home. Oh, no, no, not if they're watching me. No, I'm sticking to you. No, no, no, look, that is not how this goes down. Better give me a hundred more reasons why me and the boys don't end you right now. You did what I ask? Oi, Squid! You do as I ask? You're SD? That's right, old man. Boy ain't safe nowhere. Well, I think we can help each other out. Clean your shit up... load your crew... and meet me here. You'll get your chance. - All right. - Oh, and T-Dog? Put a shirt on. Bitch tits. Okay. Get us back so I can see where those two clowns are headed. There's an applicator for that? Yeah... there's an applicator for that. Yeah, of course there is. Listen, it's like this, Mikey. I am working, right? You're pretending to work. Working, not working. Real, fake. Coke, Pepsi. I'm the Coke, man. I am the fucking coke, man. I'm the Coke. I am the fucking Coke, man. Ed? Um... if you can guarantee my safety at home, you know... then just drop me off 'cause I've got comics to read. Fuck it! Those things will rot your brain, man. What's this place? It's one of my safe-houses. - A safe-house. Really? - Yes, really. Listen. You don't touch anything. Ah! What'd I just say? You don't touch anything? Our primary is Terry Winston. This guy started a meth lab for one of the local gangs and he has outlived his usefulness. - That's a nice car. - Yeah, I thought so. Anyway, look, the plan is to make it look like a gang war. That's why I took that. Ed, what kind of club are you in exactly? Plausible deniability is a powerful ally. I think we're a little bit past that point. Don't you? Not even close, man. - We specialize. - In? - Killing. - Damn it, Ed. I thought you said only a few were killers. Yeah, look, I know and I might have relaxed the truth on that a little bit, Mikey. But it was for your own good. I mean, who ever heard of an assassin's club that was made up of killers? Huh? But you don't need to worry, man. I'm gonna make sure you don't become a member. So trust me, man. Oh, considering the bullshit you've spouted so far, I don't see why I should. It's nothing I can't get you out of if you'd just do what I say this one time on this one simple gig. If I don't like it... I'm out. Deal. Should be honored though, recruit. - It's a very exclusive club. - Sarah will be thrilled. Hey, you check that shit. You hear me? If she finds out one thing about this, we're all fucked. You copy that? Cheer up, man. It's like an opportunity for us to get to hang out like old times, man. - Ed. - Don't you reckon? - Ed. - Huh? - I'm not killing anyone for you. - Yeah, I know. Oh, excellent! Fantastic! I didn't think you'd be able to access it that quick. Start recording as soon as you-- Hang on. Will you be quiet while I'm on the phone? Yeah. No, no, no, no. It's all good. Really? Huh! Nice work. How long will it take? Help. Okie dokie. I'll be there shortly, okay? Help! Help! Help. Help-- Did I say you could speak? God! Damn! Wah wah! Here. If you hurry, you might get there first. Yeah? Don't wanna hang around? See Cindy become a cyclops? Now where were we? - Ed, they have cameras. - Yeah, I know. - Oh shit! - Relax. All right. After I get out... you count to five, you shoot anything that moves. And if you have to speak, use a Russian accent. You ready? I'm just kidding, man. Listen, you keep your shit together, you hear? - Yeah. - All right. And try not to look so scared, man. - That's a good look. - Shut up. Un-fucking-believable. Hello. Anyone here? Where the fuck is everybody, man? Hey, you Serrig? I'm Mark, Tejo sent me. Tell me, is this how you look after an SD Investment? - Huh? - Where's Katie? Don't you fucking answer my question with a question. This where you keep the girls? Okay, okay, man. This is bullshit. I want your crew out the front now. Let's go. Come on, girls. Let's go. Let's go, let's go. Not the girls, you fucking junkie. You girls get back to work. Come on, back to work. Everybody back to work. Come on. Chop chop. Where are the boys, man? The men that were sent here to keep this place locked down, man. There ain't no one watching the girls, there ain't no one out the front. Ed was right to send me, man. These motherfuckers are wasting our time, huh? Do you want me to call Tejo? Huh? Is that what you want? Hmm? All right. No, no, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Is that everyone? Where's T-Dog? In emergency. Oh fuck! Fuck! Did you see that guy? I thought I was gonna have to reload, man. Come on, come on, let's go. Get moving! Go, Mike! Go watch the door. Mikey! Go watch the door. No following me, no street fights. Watch the door. Go on, go, go. Come on. Get your little chicken leg in there you motherf-- Ed. Ed. Ed. You there? Let's see him dodge this. I didn't know you were left-handed. It's time to be going, comrade. Don't tell me we came here so you could score. Whoa, whoa! What the hell are you doing? Haven't you heard of karmic justice? I don't think this is what Buddha had in mind. I don't know. Maybe not, man. But Mandela, now he'd be able to shit like a fat kid on cake. Whoa. Man, who's watching the door? Forget the door! What the hell is wrong with you? Are you shitting me, man? I'm sorry this little scene disturbs you, but this is my job. Yours is to watch the fucking door. Are you doing it? No. Why-- what-- Are you lost man? Do I need to put a sign? Look, there is a sign, huh? I was worried, okay? - The door, now! - The door's fine. There's no one around for miles. Yeah, well, that's not the point, Mikey. When you say you're gonna do something, man, you do it. You don't just up and leave whenever you feel like it. There it is. This isn't about the door. You're still choked that I left the service. Now, how long have you been waiting to say that? About an hour. And I probably could've waited longer, Mikey, but I'm super fucking pissed with you right now, man. And we're at it... when were you gonna tell me about Sarah? Oh no, no, no. You're in no position... ...I couldn't talk to you on account of you being dead. You had no idea what things were like, Ed. I was the one that helped them get through after you were gone. In turn, Sarah helped me accept that life goes on, all right? So like it or not, things have changed, Ed. Nothing has changed, man. You can't commit to anything. ...rich coming from you. Anything else you wanna say? Considering we haven't seen each other in how long? - Not long enough, man. - I'm sorry. When did you turn into such a gigantic asshole? Oh, I've always been an asshole, man. At least I'm not a fucking pussy. You should've stayed there. You should've stayed by the door. Will you get over it already. - No, man. - Why? Because we got Charlie-Foxtrot. Oh shit! ...Police! Okay, what do you want me to do? - Shoot someone, man! - Yeah, right. Here. What am I? An octopus? You have it. I got an idea. - The fuck you doing, man? - Just keep killing! Coming through! What was that? - Two-minute sleeper. - Shit, man. I gotta get the security drive from upstairs in the office. - Cover me. - Forget that. You're a better shot than me. - Upstairs, right? - Yeah. I'll be done in one. Where's your skateboard now, bitch? Fuck! Who's alive out there, huh? Anyone bleeding? Rise, get away from the wall. Yeah. We're done, mate. It's over. We've gotta get out of here. Okay, let's bail. Okay. Run through the door in three, two, one. Oh shit! Where'd he come from? What the hell do we do now? Ah! What the fuck? - Smoke? - Smells gross! Hey, what was that? When you said sleeper, I figured in two minutes, you'd be like... Not like sleeper, sleeper, man. You should be embarrassed. I should? Yeah. What about you? I thought you were going to show me some kind of cool, stealthy accident. I mean, what do you call this? Gang related accident. Come on, man. Let's go. Hang on. What? I only need 20. Did you get it? You don't keep me here for my fashion advice. No, I do not. Feed died about 20 minutes ago. Soon that'll work through the final protocol and then transfer it to disc. It'll be a few hours at least. How are we on the other matter? - Oh. - Factory worker. Three years, sixth RAR. Does some martial arts. Couple speeding tickets. No arrests. Kinda boring. Who's that? I think he's in love. - Mm. Girlfriend? - Fiancé, actually. - What's her go? - Not much. Yoga instructor. Born in Melbourne. And, uh... this. Oh... blessed be the gods. I wasn't sure if I should call it in or-- Oh no. No need. I'll deal with this. - All right. - Mm. - Thank you. - Yes. You didn't shoot yourself today, man, I'm proud of you. - We done here? - Yeah, for now. Good. What's gotten into you, man? You know, I can ask you the exact same thing. I don't know who that was back there, but it sure as hell wasn't the Ed I know. Yeah, too fucking right it wasn't, man. That guy's dead. And now it's just you and me, brother. Nah, man. It's just you. Where do you think you're going, man? You can't just get out - on your own. - Out? I'm not even in. Yeah, fucking A-one you're in. The moment I saved your life you were in, man. You need to get it straight. The only thing that is keeping you alive right now is a lie. My lie. You don't just fucking rock up on these guys and tell them how it is, man, they'll kill us both. You know what? And as far as the Club's concerned, man, this is the only fucking way out. Shit. Just-- just promise me you'll go home, man. We had a deal. Yeah, your ears must be burning. I was just about to check in. Yeah, yeah. Yup. Gypsies in ten.

Yeah, well, we'll take your advice into consideration. - Are we clean? - Yeah, but, Boss, the new guy-- Yeah, I think you know how this works. We're not making a mistake with you, are we Eddie? No, sir. Speaking of massive blunders. Where's Manson? - Being a good boy. - You sure about that? - Have fun, boys. - Thanks. I've got my eye on you, Mikey. Gotta say I'm confused. Why are you hanging with that two-bit hack? - Eddie? - Yeah. He was my way in. Why? Who wants to know? Someone who can help. - What are you suggesting? - A change of pace. Thanks. What direction? You tell me. How did it go back there? Yeah... Hmm. I'd like to see you try. Hey, here he is. Hey Teddy, how's it going man? I thought as much. You're wasting your time kicking around with that loser. You think that's a waste of time, You should see what I was gonna do this weekend. You need a sponsor with some experience. If you're smart, you'd leave that guy twisting in the breeze before you wake up wishing you'd taken the blue pill. - I'll keep that in mind. - Yeah, you should. This gets messy out there, and Lady Luck's an ugly bitch. - Lady luck? - Yeah. All right. I'll make sure to bring a six pack. Cheers to that. What are you doing here, man? Probie and I are just getting to know one another. You see, I thought I knew all of the club's associates in Brisvegas. How did you keep this one under the radar so long? Easy. He's not worth mentioning. I'll be in touch. You can count on that. Oh shit. - Babe. - Hey. - You're home. - So are you. You're a day early. What happened? - Flood warning. - Ah. Crap. Yeah, it was going so well, too. We were lucky to get out before they closed the roads. - Super lucky. - What have you been doing? - Uh... nothing. - Liar. - All right. - It's a new jacket. Yeah. Yeah. You like it? - No. - Oh. Okay. Looks like something my brother would wear. Take it off. I'm sorry if this little scene disturbs you, but this is my job. It's Bill and Ben, the crack-house men. Oh Ed, you've outdone yourself. - ...door now! - The door's fine... We now know that nine people have been confirmed dead - in what appears to be... - How are ya? ...a brutal gang shooting inside a large, illegal drug lab just outside of fortitude valley. Wakey, wakey, amateur Ed. I thought your kind slept through the day. I tried to explain to The Five that this was going to happen, but they just couldn't see it. And now I can show them. Oh Marilyn, did you wet the bed, did you? Man, almost. I've been pissing myself all morning with laughter. I happen to cross a certain set of video files Number One will find, um, very interesting. Me and his prize-winning beagle. How'd you get that? The same way I got everything else on you, Edward. I'm just that good. I even know about the lies you've been telling. Yeah. I know your little secret. But that's not why I'm calling. Turn on your TV. Thanks for that, Jeff. Moving back to our main story this morning... ...late last night... - Ah! Good morning. - Hey babe. - What are you making? - Eggs. God. You don't hear that everyday. - Serves them right. - What? A bunch of gangbangers shot each other downtown last night. ...not willing to comment on the exact cause of the shooting at this time. - And you got a message. - ...they found a large amount of drugs and manufacturing equipment. One of the largest finds so far this year. The lone survivor, also believed to be an SD member... - I'll get it. - No, no, no. - No, no, no, no. - What are you doing? Nothing. We-- we gotta go. Michael. - It doesn't look like nothing. - Oh. Yup. Okay. Come on, Michael. We know you're in there. Okay. Yup, you're right. It's something. It's something big. I think those guys are hitmen. Whatever? Michael, we don't want to hurt you. We just want to talk to you. - Okay, let's go. - Mm-hmm. - You can't say it like that. - I beg your pardon? Don't you watch any TV? When people say stuff like that, they're just gonna whack somebody. I was going to show him a card. Oh great. Show him a card. Oh it's all good, mate. Michael. We're friends of Eddie's. Ah f-- Yeah, bring the car out in front. Yeah, he's going OJ. Why's he going for orange juice? - He's running. - Oh. Mike, where are we going? - Oh just, um... - What? What are you doing? Are those guys really hitmen? Come on. Let's-- let's race. Yeah, let's race. Come on, let's race. It's fun. Mike, I thought you were joking around. - Who are those guys? - I don't know. Not sure. - Then why are we running? - Okay. I had a little bit of a weird day yesterday and things got a little... - There he is - Come on. Let's go. Gotta run. Come on. Quick. Get Manson on the phone. Let him know. Yeah. What do you mean? What do you mean you had a problem with him? - Oh geez. - Mike, will you slow down a minute? This is ridiculous. Hey, hey Michael. You tired? I'll give you a lift. I'll just pop the boot. - Really? - Yeah. - No, we're good. Thanks. - Michael! Who was that? Look. I realize this is probably very confusing, but I promise I'll tell you everything once we get there. - Where? - To the safe-house. Oh, to the safe-house. When the hell did you get a safe-house, Mike? - What do you do when I'm away? - Whoa, whoa! This is not good. Okay. Babe, you gotta go, all right? Just cut through the park, and I'll catch up with you, - all right? - Fine. I'll go. But this... not over. Michael. Why are you running? What? My girlfriend and I go jogging every morning. You two should try it. We ain't gonna hurt you. No one is going to arrest you. No shit, Sherlock. Cops aren't as ugly as you lot. Is that so? - You need to come with us. - No, no, no, no. You need to leave me alone. I don't think you've got a choice. Don't! Are you serious? It was straightforward. Shit! - Hey, hey, hey, hey. - Oh, fuck me sideways. Change of plan. Follow her. Where do you think you're going, sweetheart? That's it. Just over here. - Mi... Mike! - Hey, look out behind! Behind! Behind you! Ah! Little rest after your run. Okay, go. - Hey, Mikey! - Hey. Could you save us the trouble. Just borrowing some gear. Sick pajamas. Have you lost your fucking marbles? This isn't why we're here. We're supposed to bring him in easy. Easy? Oh yeah, yeah. Tell that to the B team. They're at the top of the hill sweeping up their own teeth. Can't take Mohammed to the mountain, you take his girlfriend. He'll go wherever the fuck you want. The Five are gonna grind your balls when they find out - about this. - Bullshit. They'll thank me. This chick's like a two-for-one deal. Get us to the yard. Fuck. Damn it! What the f-- He's behind us? Yeah, but he's only on a skateboard. No way he's gonna catch us on that thing. Turn left up ahead. He won't be able to follow us in traffic. He's gone. Told you. - Hey! Get off! - Sarah! Baby! Sarah! Sarah, wake up! Fuck off! Mike, it's the middle of the road. - Sarah! - There, there. Yeah, I see it. I see it. Escape through this, Mikey. Up there. That hill will stop him. Huh. He'll never get up here. Where are you, Mikey? Where are you? Holy shit! I'm seeing him. What's this guy's problem anyway? Give it a bit more speed. He's got no chance. All right. Hold on. How hard is it to outrun a skateboard? I'm trying! I've had enough of this bullshit. Playtime over. Whoa, whoa! Not today, Spider-man. Fuck! Well, that's just great. Hey, thanks for coming, Mike. Now, listen, listen. Look, I know you're shitting on me right now, man. You know what? And I deserve it, you know? I really do. But we have to put that shit behind us right now, man, 'cause we-- Dude, what-- Some heavies from the club rocked up just as I got your text, okay? You said run and so we ran and they started-- I didn't say run, Mikey, I said ASAP man. That doesn't mean skip breakfast and don't put your pants on. Whoa... did you say we? Sarah's retreat got rained out last night. When those dudes rocked up, we were on the news and-- I mean, I just freaked out. I couldn't just leave her there and then-- and then your fucking girlfriend from the other night just rolled up and took her-- - Who? Manson? - Yeah. Oh, that fucking idiot. Oh man, I knew he was gonna mess this all up. He can't help himself, can he? That fucking ego fucking maniac. That's it man! I'm gonna end this guy! Whoa, whoa. Do you know where he is? You know where he's taking her, right? Fuck! Check this out... Hey, boss. She's waking up. Is she now? That's about time. All right there. Got a lot to talk about. Here. Have a drink. Drink up. I promise you. It's just water. That's a good girl. Excuse me for a second. Donny, Donny, Donny. Showing me up like that. You think I can extend the deadline? Well, I can't. You're a-- What? Yep? Hey boss. It's me... Manson. Yeah. Yeah. You're not going to believe this. You did what? - I just-- I just thought-- - What? That you were smarter than us? That you could do a better job? No, I've got something to show-- Listen, you muppet. You gotta talk to Eddie and smooth this shit out. And if I suspect for one moment... ...you're playing one of your twisted little games with that girl... I'll come down there myself. Capeesh? Yeah. Thanks... for nothing. Normally we'd like to keep things a little more discrete than this... but your brother's given me no choice. Mi... Mike's not my brother, he's my fiancé. Did I say boyfriend? Ed? Yes, you dopey bitch. Welcome to the conversation. You twisted prick. My brother's dead. I'm telling you the truth. He was killed in action years ago. Look, I don't know what you think Mike's done, but it has nothing to do with Ed. Oh. Of course not. You're gonna love this. Little help, please? I don't know. What'd you have me do? Yeah? Give me the phone. Call your brother. - Don't know how. - No. Call your brother! Call your brother! Call him! - Call your brother! - Okay! - Do it now! Call him! - Okay! I'll fucking hit you so hard, you'll have to drink through a straw! Let's go. Make the call. I will. Just gotta find the number. - Sit your ass down. - There's no reception. Oh. Okay. Make it quick. - Call your brother. - Yeah. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Get her. Get her. Let-- Oh for God's sake. Come on. - Jeff, get in there. - Get off! Get her hand. Let-- let me go! Hey. Tough day, big fella. Didn't break a nail, did ya? And you-- Stupidity must be a family trait. Do you wanna chain her up, boys? Come on. Let's go. Grab her legs. - And get the handcuffs. - Let me go! Get off! Okay, so we... came out here. Right? And I lost them somewhere around there. - From your place? - Yeah. - That's awesome, man. - Well, what fucking good is it? She's gone and it's my fault, man. No. No, it's not. Manson's my problem, man. That's the whole reason I've stayed hidden. So things like this wouldn't happen, man. You, mom, Sarah, the kids across the street. It doesn't matter. If Manson finds a weak spot, he'll squeeze. I'm gonna get her back, Ed. I know you are, man. And I wasn't lying when I said-- You know, I have been lying, Mikey, but I wasn't lying when I said that we're a tight group, all right? It might take me a few more phone calls, but I'll find her. You might not have to, man. That. That is why I love her. Oh, dude, I know this place, man. This is an old clubhouse, man. Yeah. Oh, I don't know, man. Manson's not the coolest kid on the block, but he does have some sort of pull. That's until everyone finds out that I'm his new boss. - Yeah. - Congratulations. Yeah. All right, I'm yet to accept though, yeah. Do you think you can, uh, find me another meth lab?

Hey, look at her squirm. Chug chug. Get us a top up, champ. How about now, you dirty bitch? Are you starting to get your memory back? - Huh? - Screw you, psycho. I don't know anything! I told you I haven't seen him in years. All right. Back we go. Easy going. Okay, okay, Mikey. Which one is it? Let me check. Looks like the building behind those cars. Get down. Hey, I know that chick. Yeah, I do too. Now shh. I got something special for her. Psst. Ed? What the fuck's going on? I thought this was supposed to be a simple review. Mm. Tell me about it. - So how's my sister? She okay? - For now. Manson's fucking lost it. Thinks you've done some sorta deal with The Five and he's pissed. My deal with the boss has nothing to do with Manson. You know how buggy he gets when you go over his head. No wonder he grabbed her like that. Oh, you were there, were you? Huh? Do you know where she is? Yeah. You okay? - Yes. She's in-- - Whoa, whoa! I'll catch you. What? She's a massive bitch, man. Come on. Let's go. Come on, princess. - Get us top up, champ. - She's had enough. Oh fine. Party pooper Pete. You haven't seen him? Then we'll call someone who has. Under Mikey? Or slack in bed? Now seriously, Mike, man. Don't mess this up tonight. Seriously, don't get in my way. Well, try not to get in my way. - That's what I do. - Shit. What the fuck? - It's Sarah, man. - Oh shit. Hello? Mike? Mike, no. It's a trap. He's after Ed. Michael. No, it's not a trap. - Mike, no. Don't listen to him. - It's trapish. She's trying to-- Can you be quiet? It's not a trap, okay? But I'll keep you in the know. Have you seen Ed? No, no. No? No. That's too bad. Um, you've got half an hour. When you find him, can you give me a call back, please? Okay. Bye-bye now. He's got the biggest hard on for you man, all right. Yeah. Must be the hair, man. Psst. Still. You gotta agree that the girl's a weird... All right. I'll pop up and do them from this side, - you can go around. - No, no. I got this. All right. Hurry up, hurry up. Yeah, true. - Oh? - Shit. Blindside. Max? Shit. Shit. Nice. Two more unconscious bodies. Would you quit doing that? Please? Don't have a cry, come on. Let's go. I just don't understand why you have to shoot everyone all the time. Look, I know this isn't your thing, but don't make it boring for me, man. Well, if you were a little more creative, you wouldn't have to, you know, keep killing people all the time. Look, you can go if you like. I've got it from here. Chances are they're doing this to get to me anyway. You wouldn't have to if it wasn't for me. All right? All set? I know, I know. Everyone's pissed at me. Blah, blah, blah. What you gonna do about it? Out of the way, Mike. Move, move! - Happy? - Thanks. Jesus! Sarah. Hey. - It's not her. - Thank fuck for that. Come on. Come on. Man didn't do this, I mean what if-- No, no. If Manson wants to hurt her, he's gonna make sure we watch. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. - What's up? - She passed out again. Just wait, all right? You go around the back. I'll run point on the hole for two. Go that way. Don't be late. Don't be crazy. That's our motto. No. No, nothing, really. Of course I haven't been drinking. Yeah, that's rich coming from you. Yeah, yeah. I'll make sure I keep an eye out. - Where's the service here? - Yeah, pretty ordinary. What the f-- - Mike. - Sarah. - Are you all right? - No. I'm a fucking hostage. Not to mention that the guy that took me said that Ed is still alive and you knew all about it. Look, first of all... The guy that took you, okay? Right, he's a complete mental case. Secondly, what would I be doing with your dead brother? Hell yeah! Oh I-- I-- How-- how much did you see? Enough to know that if you don't tell me what the hell is going on here, you may as well disappear as well. Where has he been? How long have you known about it? Two days. Okay? All right, I swear I literally bumped into him the other night in the street. Where is he now? That's a very good question. Michael! Calm down, Michael. Now that you're here, it won't be long. One of The Five is coming to sort this out. I get nervous in interviews. Can we do this by e-mail? One of the five what? She really has no idea, has she? Well, you see, Sarah. Your brother risked a certain level of exposure that the members of the Hunter's club found highly dis-- - Eddie - Hey, rat face. How are you? - Better I get this. - Whoa, whoa, whoa! No, no! The guard's got the keys. Okay, better. Go, get up. Up up. Come on, Sarah. Let's go. Hey-- Oh! Hey! - Hey, hey, hey! - Hey, hey. You all right? All right. - Hey. Let's not tell mum. - Shut up! - Hey there, whoa. - Hey, hey, hey! What a beautiful moment. Oh. That's going straight in the Facebook. I helped a brother and sister reunite after a tragic separation. Then I gouged my fucking eyeballs out! Edward. - Where have you been? - Around. Take her back to my place. I'll distract him. - I'm guessing this is your idea. - Yeah. - Where's The First? - On his way. Did you really not know - about Eddie? - Uh-huh. - Then why are they after you? - Because I screwed up. And screwing up around these guys gets you killed. - I have to go back. - And do what? I'm not quite sure. But look, I'm sorry I didn't tell you about Ed and just-- everything, but we don't have much time to talk right now. - All right? - You're right. - No, no, no, no. - No! He's my brother. I'm going back with you. Look. I know what's going through your mind right now. I know what you're thinking, all right? But just trust me. Please. I want you to find someplace to hide. Just like paintball. Stay low and... don't get shot. Can you do that for me? Please? - Yeah. - Go, go. Oh. Can't you bleed any faster man? Come on. What is it with you with the ladies, Manson? I saw the finger painting you did on the girl outside. Real piece of work. You know that? I'm a fucking Picasso compared to you two clowns. That girl's a piece of art. Why can't anyone see that? French wouldn't call that art. Yeah? Well, when The First gets here... he's gonna see you for what you really are. Nothing more than a liability. And then I'm gonna stitch up all the loose ends. If you think that hiding the evidence, kidnapping my sister, killing me... is gonna trick The Five into believing you're not a fucking wack job. You're dreaming, Manson. You fucking sure about that? Oh fuck! Ow! Fuck a monkey's ass! - You all right? - What are you doing here, man? - Waxing off. What do you mean? - Waxing off. Give me some, man. Give me some. This is not the time, man. You need to put pressure on it-- I don't wanna kiss you. I'm not gonna kiss-- - Hey, where's Manson? - He's gone. What? - He's gone. - Gone where? He's fucking outta here, man. Flick. Flick. You out here? Come on. We need to get the car and-- - Dude, put two hands on-- - Don't touch it. Don't touch it. I'm okay. Okay. What do you got? What the fuck? Put that-- What are you going? - This is really... - I'm okay. I'm all right. - Sarah, shh-- - Go, go, go. I love you, man. You mess my girl up. It's time to mess you up. Shut up! Put your head up here. Hey, Lurch! Drop the fucking gun, quick-draw. Mike... - Drop the fucking gun! - All right, all right! Here. - Good boy. - Look, The Club can have me, all right? - I'll do whatever you want. - Yeah. I know you will. But the Club's got very specific rules about family. Did you know that? They can never know about us. Just let us go man, okay? She's got nothing to do with this. Get in here and hold your girl's hand. Like if it's between you and Ed-- - Come in here and kneel down! - All right. Okay. Please. Get in here and kneel down next to your girl! Now! Sarah! Damn it! Sarah, Sarah. You okay? Just breathe. Keep your palm tight. Put pressure on it. This'll do. See ya Ed. - Mike? - Hmm. This hurts way more than paintball. Okay. All right. You're gonna be fine, okay? Just hang in there. Just hold. - Do something for me? - Anything. - Oh yeah. - Kill that piece of shit. Hey Ed! Lights out! - Ed-- - Mind if I butt in? All right. Let's dance. How's the girl? Where's my goddamn gun? Ah, there you are. All right, then. Let's do this, big boy. Goddamn that hurts! Come on, Mikey. Enough with the running. Mikey. You shot me in the hand. That pissed me off. I see you through there, Mikey. Let's go you little shit. Mikey. Hey-hey, Mikey. You're making me reload on you, man. That's okay. Doesn't change how this ends. It's a shame, though. You had some real potential. Yeah. You should understand that none of this is personal. You and I could've made a pretty good team, buddy. Where are you, you little turd? There you are. There you are. Come on. Out you come. Huh? Ed? Hey. You all right? - Yeah? What were you doing, man? - Yeah. Looks like you were wrong about this one, Eddie. He'll do just fine.
