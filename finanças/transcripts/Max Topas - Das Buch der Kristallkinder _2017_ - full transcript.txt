Isla Indigo, southern pacific region, 547 years after the disappearance of the book. Max Topas - The Book Of The Crystal Children I’d have liked to write a school magazine, too, when I was young. But somehow I just didn't have the time... Well... I guess it makes sense to start in the sixteenth century. Back then, the Catholic Church persecuted and threatened to kill anyone who did not share its beliefs. Many children and young people were persecuted, too, and locked up and even executed. Often, their only choice was to hide their secrets from the world to protect themselves and the world, especially the children yet to be born, from much worse. And so the story of the nine-year-old boy starts on a cruel winter's night in 1516... Duchy of Jülich-Berg, November 1516. Atrocities were carried out again yesterday and many people were put to death. They will not rest until they have destroyed you and obtained all of your secrets. You must leave. You must take the book to safety. We will do as you bid. The book is in the chest, together with everything else that we must hide from evil. And you must keep your secret safe because no one must ever find the book. As you told us – we will not even tell you where we have buried the chest. We are prepared to sacrifice our lives for this secret. Go now, leave. Do not waste time. And then what happened to the children and the secret? To this day, no one knows. The children disappeared? Legend says they were never seen again. And what about the monk who was there? In any case, the secret that those two children hid so well several hundred years ago that it has never been found... ...dramatically changed the life of this boy within just a couple of hours... Düsseldorf, western Germany, July 2016 Can somebody please take the kettle off the stove? It’s nearly eight o’clock! Why didn’t anyone wake me up? Mum? Mum? Mum, why didn’t anyone wake m.. Mum? Dad? Mum? Stupid kettle! That’s impossible! Looking for your family? That's pointless. You won't find them. Who... who are you? Who am I? Well... ...they call me Monsieur Quidam, and so do I. And I can tell you where your family is. Right now, the three of them, your mother, father and sister, are on their way to the airport, to travel around the world. To the airport? Travel around the world? What are you talking about? You haven’t yet the faintest idea what you are about... ...my young friend. Get out of here, Monsieur Qui... dam. I’m sure my father will be back any minute! Stop that, my boy. Now listen carefully, or I’ll become unpleasant! Quite out of the blue, your family left on a trip around the world. They have me to thank for that because I – shall we say – urgently suggested it. Or in other words: I put a spell on them! Two hours from now they’ll board their plane and then they’ll have no memory of you or their life to date and you’ll never see them again. They’ll spend all your family’s money on their trip around the world and end up destitute and miserable somewhere far away. This is just a joke. Are you one of my father’s colleagues? It’s a practical joke, isn’t it? This is far from a silly joke, my friend. Look in there! Look in there! Go on, look in there! See where your family is right now. That can’t be true... That can’t really be happening. Yes. It can and it is! Or have you found your family anywhere here? They’ve gone, all of them. You must have noticed that by now! But it’s entirely within your power to lift this spell. Just bring me the Book of the Crystal Children, in two hours – which means, at five minutes past ten precisely – to the crypt of Saint Lambert’s Church, and your family will come straight back home from the airport. If you’re not there with the book at five past ten precisely, your family will board their plane and you’ll never see any of them again and they’ll have no memory of you whatsoever! I don’t understand what you want from me. You must be mistaking me for someone else. I don’t know anything about a Book of the Crystal Children. My friend, you don’t yet know anything about your extraordinary abilities or that book. Ring this woman. She’ll help you and then you’ll understand what I want from you. I expect you in two hours in the crypt of Saint Lambert’s Church at, let’s say, six minutes past ten. I’m giving you the extra minute because you listened so attentively. I advise you to be there on time, with the Book of the Crystal Children! If not, you’ll never, ever see your family again! As soon as I’ve closed the door behind me, you’ll ring Madame Edda. The clock is ticking... You won’t reach your parents by phone! Stop wasting time! Grandma and Grandpa I’m starting to think that you aren’t really listening. You will not be able to ring anyone other than Madame Ed... Madame Edda Spiritual Medium and Advisor for Chrystal Children Welcome to my website. My name is Madame Edda. I’m a spiritual medium and, most especially, an advisor for Crystal Children. Just ring me when you have questions or would like to make an appointment. I look forward to hearing from you. Hello? Hello? Are you Madame Edda? Yes And what’s your name? Max. I have a question. Could you tell me about the Book of the Crystal Children? Are you ringing from Düsseldorf? Yes Then come and see me, I happen to be here in your city right now. I have an idea what this is about. But we can only discuss it face to face. When can I come to see you? How about the day after tomorrow? The day after tomorrow? Can’t I come now? Now? My boy, I’m really very busy! Just come at five o’clock the day after tomorrow and we’ll talk about it... No. That’s too late for Monsieur Quidam. Did you say Monsieur Quidam? I’m at the funfair, my caravan is down by the Rhine, next to the ferry landing. Do you know it? Yes of course, I know it, there we... Good, good! My caravan is easy to find, it has the sign of the Crystal Children on it: a blue hand with a crystal. Do you understand? Okay, thank you. I’ll be quick. Thank you! Come in! The door is open! Hello. I’m Max. We just spoke on the phone. Take a seat, young man. Yes, yes, you are one of them. I can see it very clearly. What do you see? That you’re a Crystal Child! I see it in your aura, which contains a wonderful indigo blue, and in your eyes that mirror an unbelievably mature soul. And I sense your enormous spiritual energy. I’m a what? What does it mean, a Crystal Child? What did this Monsieur Quidam want from you? My family has just disappeared, my parents and my little sister. When I woke up no one was there, I mean at home. And then this Monsieur Quidam was at the door and told me he had put a spell on my parents and that I’d only see them again if I took the Book of the Crystal Children to him. My boy, Monsieur Quidam seems to know something we don’t know yet, namely your ability as a Crystal Child. But what does that mean? A Crystal Child? Look at this... Crystal Children are young people with exceptionally old and mature souls. This enables them to have very special abilities. As they grow up, these abilities disappear again and the children just become great people who enrich our world. We humans are spiritual beings who use their body here on earth just for a while. Over the millennia, we use many bodies so that we can have many different experiences, good ones and bad ones. And that’s why my family has disappeared? It’s all my fault? But what could this Monsieur Quidam want from me? I don’t know, I can’t see it. But it’s not your fault, none of it is. Evil always tries to smash its way into the world. You must go to the Dreamland of the Crystal Children and find Vincy. He has the ability to see such things. I must go where? To the Dreamland of the Crystal Children. Well, your soul can leave your body and go to Dreamland. It’s where Crystal Children can meet and share their experiences. It’s an enchanted place, protected and full of magic. So my soul can really leave my body? I’ve had that feeling for a long time, at night, in my dreams. You’ve always sensed this, haven’t you? Your soul – that’s YOU! – can go to the Dreamland of the Crystal Children. Just as in a dream you have at night, only it’s absolutely real and true. And out there in Dreamland I’ll be able to get the Book? The Book of the Crystal Children? Sadly, I don’t know much about it. I don’t even know whether it’s a real book or whether it’s just a beautiful myth. A myth? Yes, a myth. A story that’s often told but no one knows whether it’s true. The myth of the Book of the Crystal Children says that it contains ancient knowledge of everything that Crystal Children have recorded over hundreds or even thousands of years. But what exactly is behind it all I don’t know. What am I supposed to do now? Monsieur Quidam wants this book just after ten, or I’ll never see my family again. And it’s already gone half past eight. Well, first some good news: while you’re in Dreamland, hardly any time passes in the real world. A day in Dreamland equals five minutes on earth. You’ll have lots of time to gather information in Dreamland. And secondly – I’ll help you get to Dreamland right now, since you’ve never done this before. Okay? What are you doing? Relax. I’ll now use energetic support to help you get to Dreamland for the first time. Someone will be there to meet you. I don’t know who, but someone will be there to welcome you on your first visit, and to show you around. Now close your eyes. I don't know... Do it now. Close your eyes. You do want to see your family again, don’t you? Trust me. It happens quite easily and it doesn’t hurt at all... Hello? Is anybody there? What is this place? Welcome to the Dreamland of the Crystal Children. I’m David. And who are you? Hi, I’m Max. Can you help me? Of course, Max, that’s why I’ve come to see you. Here in Dreamland you can decide where you want to be what you want to experience which of the Crystal Children you want to meet all you have to do is make a wish. Do I have to be able to do anything or learn anything? No, watch me, I’ll show you. You can be anywhere you like here. For example, in Spain. Or in America. Or on the Great Wall of China! You just have to think it! Then I’d like to be in Spain. The finca my sister and our parents and I stayed in for our holidays last year. Wow! That’s the finca! Cool! A Pool! Max! Come, join me! Yeah! Super! Where are you? Where are you...? Wow, that was incredible! I met a David and I can go wherever I like in Dreamland, I just have to make a wish and POW! I’m there! I was even in our holiday finca and I jumped into the pool... You should go to Dreamland now and find Vincy the Wise so you’ll learn what your special ability is. I’m sure you can ask him about the book, too. He’ll know about it. Vincy the Wise knows almost everything. He has one of the most mature and curious souls of all the Crystal Children. And how do I find this Vincy? Just make a wish. Wishing gets you absolutely everything in Dreamland. And now that you’ve been there before, you just close your eyes and wish yourself back there. That’s how easily you can get to Dreamland from now on. Okay. I’m going to Dreamland to meet Vincy the Wise. Yes, do it! Okay. I’m closing my eyes and make a wish to meet Vincy the Wise in Dreamland. To Dreamland, to Vincy the Wise. Wow! That’s brilliant. Did you do that? Yes, sure, I imagined it. You’re Vincy, right? Right. You wanted to see me. And here in Dreamland, whatever you wish for happens. Amazing. I won’t keep you, I just have a quick question: can you tell me where to find the Book of the Crystal Children? The Book of the Crystal Children? You want me to tell you where to find it? Yes please. It’s really, really important. Sure, for whom wouldn’t it be important? Whoever has the Book of the Crystal Children can rule the world. But as far as I know, it’s absolutely safe and no one will ever be able to get hold of it. Oh, it’s that kind of book! Now I understand. Maybe I can help you with anything else? No. Listen, my parents and my sister have disappeared, a man has put a spell on them and now he wants me to get him the Book of the Crystal Children... Someone is after the book? Yes, some really weird guy called Monsieur Quidam. That doesn’t sound good. What did he look like? Really weird. With a strange eye-glass and his clothes were somehow odd... And a walking stick with a telescope that showed me my family at the airport... Sounds like a Steamer. Not good. Not good at all! A Steamer? Yes, a Steamer. Enemies of all Crystal Children. They want only bad things, only evil. Not nice people! I noticed! About your family – that’s really bad. But there is someone who might be able to help you: Ernest, a former Steamer, who is now on our side. Lives in Florida. Florida? How am I supposed to get to Florida? But that’s really simple for a Space-Jumper like you. A space... what? Oh right, you don’t know yet what you can do. What I can do? No, I guess I don’t. Every Crystal Child has a special ability. For example, I can see other Crystal Children’s special abilities. And I can tell you that you are a Crystal Child who can conquer space. Okay. What does that mean? You can go wherever you want. Anytime. Yes sure, here in Dreamland. But then I’m not really there, am I? That’s usually right. Except that you’re a Space-Jumper. That’s something really special. And how do I do that? You just go wherever you want to be, here in Dreamland. Just make a wish. Yes okay, I got that. And then you leave Dreamland and enter the real world, just by making another wish. Only very, very few of the Crystal Children can do that and you’re one of them. That's really cool! Okay. That sounds easy. And where exactly do I find this Ernest? He’s in a place called Key West. And don’t be too surprised but he’s 104 years old. Okay, thank you. Ernest in Key West... Key West!! Wow! That's so cool! Okay – this is where Ernest lives. And now I must make a wish to be in Florida, in real life. Amazing! Oh my God! He’s gone! He’s a Space-Jumper! I met a space-jumper. That's fantastic! What? It’s nighttime? I couldn’t possibly wake up someone who’s 104... Okay, it can’t be helped. I just have to do it. Ernest, please open the door. Ernest! Who are you? Are you nuts? What are you doing? It’s just gone half past three, it’s the middle of the night! I know it’s nighttime here, but I must speak with Ernest, it’s urgent! Evidently, or you wouldn’t be making such a racket. I’m really sorry but it’s about my family, a matter of life and death. Please may I speak with Ernest? Would you wake him up? He is here, isn’t he? Yes, sure, Ernest is here. Sure... Has someone sent you? Yes, he’s called Vincy. But right now I can’t explain to you who he is. I urgently need to speak with Ernest. Is Vincy someone... from... ...Dreamland? Yes, exactly. You know Dreamland? Are you a... A Crystal Child? Kind of. You had best come in then... May I speak with Ernest now? Yes sure. Right now. Your family left on a trip around the world... I can see it very clearly... I put a spell on them... That you’re a Crystal Child! And don’t be too surprised but he’s 104 years old... Don’t be too surprised... You mean... you’re Ernest? That is right. Vincy told me that you are... That I’m 104 years old? That is quite right, too. I was once a Crystal Child, just like you. When I grew up and realized that my special abilities would disappear, I crossed over to the side of evil and became a Steamer. That saved my special abilities but in exchange I had to serve evil forever. When I was 57, I reversed my decision. That's possible? Yes, it is. But it involves a lot of suffering. If you’re a Steamer who makes such a decision, your body immediately begins to regress until one day you’ll die as a tiny baby. I know exactly why you’re here. I can see it in your thoughts. Of course I will help you. You will need to do this: Confront your very worst fears in Dreamland and you’ll meet a special child, who’ll tell you where to find a "Salincan Crystal". And such a crystal helps me with Monsieur Quidam? A Salincan Crystal... ...can render a Steamer unable to cast spells. But: it only works for the future, it doesn’t automatically invalidate spells already cast. So you’ll have to consider very carefully how best to use it. Okay... And how do I confront my fears? Well, Max. Go to Dreamland, where you can wish for anything. Then wish for what you'd absolutely never want to wish for. I mean, what you most want to avoid. And what about the Book of the Crystal Children? Will I be able to find it? The Book of the Crystal Children? You won’t, because it no longer exists. After it was hidden many hundreds of years ago, it decomposed in the earth. The old chest was found some years ago, totally rotted, and next to it, just some tiny remnants of the book. No way!!! I must tell Monsieur Quidam! Surely then he’ll have to release my family? He won’t believe you and he won’t do it. And even if he believed it, your family would be lost. They don’t matter to him at all and he’d enjoy your pain as a kind of compensation. Obtain the crystal; it’s your only chance! Fine. I’ll do as you said. I don’t have a choice. Time is running out and I simply have to trust you. Okay, now think: what’s my greatest fear? Fear of heights. I think it’s my fear of heights. I feel dizzy just looking down from the kerbside... You’re not serious, are you? Who or what are you? Are you me? Your mirror image. Who better to talk about your greatest fear with than you yourself? Nothing can surprise me anymore out here. Okay! What now? You know that your greatest fear is not the fear of heights. No, I believe it is. You HOPE it is. That’s because you don’t want to face your real greatest fear. I just don’t know what my greatest fear is. It might be fear of heights. Why not just try it? Then you’ll see whether a special child appears to help you, as Ernest said it would. But I don’t think that’s the right way. And? How does that feel? Really really terrible. I want to get down. You’ll have to put up with it a while, or you won’t know whether the special child appears... It’s not happening – and you know it. But I AM scared. It’s not the right kind of fear. But I don’t want to go into the cellar! You have to. You know that your cellar at home is your worst fear. Remember your nightmares. There’s no other way. Just get on with it! Okay. Oh man... ...the cellar... Whoa, you scared me! Who are you? I’m Sny, a snow-fairy. A snow-fairy? You must be the special child I’m supposed to meet here... That’s right. You’ve faced your worst fear and now I’ll grant you a wish here in Dreamland. Okay, that’s great. They said you could tell me where I can find a Salincan Crystal? Yes, I can. And where is that? In New Zealand, in the Dark House. Go to the Peel Forest near the Rangitata River. Peel Forest, Rangitata River. Okay. And then? Take a blank sheet of paper, it will show you the way. A blank sheet of paper? That’s right. Go to the Peel Forest and look at the paper, and I’ll show you the way to the Dark House. Oh right, so I need a blank sheet of paper and then off to the Peel Forest in New Zealand... Ernest, I need a sheet of paper. That’ll do. Thanks! Hello, why are you here? People, we have a visitor. Go on, tell us, why are you here? I’m here because I’m looking for the Salincan Crystal. The what? The Salincan Crystal. You think it’s here? Yes... You must be an optimist. A brave guy, isn't he? Check it out – right in front of you. The hole in the ground! Go on – you’ll find it there. Okay – I need to get home! If you’re not there with the book at five past ten precisely, your family will board their plane and you’ll never see any of them again... A Salincan Crystal... ...can render a Steamer unable to cast spells. But: it only works for the future, it doesn’t automatically invalidate spells already cast. So you’ll have to consider very carefully how best to use it. What am I supposed to do? Only 36 minutes and 40 seconds to go... Only 36 minutes and 30 seconds... Only 26 min... My friends at school, maybe they could help me. Dude! Where did you come from? I didn’t hear you! I need help, urgently! Help? What kind of help? Why aren’t you in class? Mrs Kesse-Witting is really worried. Your parents didn’t ring to say you weren’t coming. What’s up? Have you been here in the loo all the time? It’s almost break time. Could you meet me in the historic classroom and bring the others along, too? And then what? Please, it’s really important, we have to be able to talk and mustn’t be disturbed. I’ve to tell you something. And I really need help! Okay, you’re making it sound very ominous. See you... You don’t believe my story, do you? Um, you’re just winding us up. What’s the point of this? No, and unfortunately it’s true – all of it. Your parents have been abducted and you can just snap your fingers and you’re in Florida or New Zealand? Yeah right... No, not abducted. They’ve been put under a spell, and I... Oh right! A spell, not an abduction. Then I’ll believe you, of course! Max, what’s the matter with you? You skip classes and now you tell us such a dumb story? Did you drink alcohol by mistake? Even if it all were true, we couldn't help you... Even if it were true? You mean, you believe him? Of course not!! I’m just saying... Max, I’m sorry. I don’t know what’s up with you, but I’m going out into the schoolyard until break time is over. I’m coming, too. Me too! That wasn’t really funny, Max! Wait! I can prove it to you! I’ll just show you that I can space-jump. I’ll disappear right before your eyes. That’ll prove it, won’t it? Oh sure, I’ve seen that magic trick on TV. Just come back to class... No one will ever buy any of this. I wouldn’t believe it either. I have to go to Dreamland, find someone who has some good ideas... Hi, I’m Max. Who are you? I'm Mila. Hello, Mila. I’m looking for someone to give me some advice and I ended up here in Dreamland with you. Then you’ve done the right thing. And you can help me? Not me. But HAL can, my associate in black right next to you. HAL? HAL stands for „Habe alle Lösungen“ („Have all solutions“) There’s something similar in some film, I thought it was cool. You mean, I can ask you something and you type it in No. You can talk to HAL directly and he replies to you. No. You can talk to HAL directly and he replies to you. Okay! Did you invent this? Yes. And why? All the knowledge of people and Crystal Children gets stored in there, so HAL can find answers to everything. Wow! Here in Dreamland? That's possible? Where else? It’s not really possible elsewhere. Certainly not for us children. And it would cost a fortune! And why is it so cold here? The installation produces unbelievably much heat and must be kept cool. Go on, ask it something! The computer? Yes of course. Talk to it. Okay... well... You’re HAL? Yes. Hello Max. How do you know my name? You just introduced yourself to Mila and told her your name. What is your special ability as a Crystal Child? I'm a Space-Jumper. A Space-Jumper... That is very special. I am honoured. How can I help you? I have a massive problem and I urgently need help. I need an idea. This morning my family disappeared and then a Steamer turned up at my door... ...And then I came to Dreamland. And? Can you help me? Yes, I think I can. But first I must tell you some things of importance to Space-Jumpers. Space-Jumpers are very special indeed. In all the world there is currently only one, and that is you. Be careful: space-jumping changes your physical body. For example, your hair may be longer after a space-jump, or it may have a different colour. This is important to know because other people may notice when such changes occur so very quickly. And as no one other than Crystal Children should know about your special ability, it might be difficult to explain. They don’t feel any longer than they were before. Well... you are in Dreamland now. Clothing, hair – it’s all to suit how you feel or where you are. Mostly you will find yourself wearing your favourite clothes, or clothing that keeps you warm, like right now. It may be different each time you visit Dreamland. You must also know this: No space-jumping with a Salincan Crystal! If you do, it loses its power. Two or three space-jumps are all it takes to completely destroy a Salincan Crystal. And when you use it against Steamers, you must ensure that it does not shine, or they will notice it immediately. But if you place it in boiling water for 15 minutes, it will keep its power but will not shine for around two hours. 15 minutes? But I have hardly any time left. It is important that you do this, so that the Steamer does not notice the crystal straight away. If he does, he will not touch it. You can keep talking with HAL. I’ve to leave Dreamland, I’m just doing a maths test at school. Bye Mila, thank you and good luck! Yes Mila, good luck. It is not nice of you to interrupt me. Max, listen carefully, I have a plan for you so that you can save your family even without the Book of the Crystal Children. You need the crystal but it must not shine, and a book and a bag you can tie at the top. Then you do the following... Actually, it’s really much longer and darker than before! Hardly any time left. Encyclopaedia of Secret Knowledge How am I supposed to do all this? For the plan to work I’ll need my rucksack. And I mustn’t space-jump with the crystal, so I’ll need my scooter to get to the church in time. But both are still at Madame Edda’s and if I space-jump there now, I don’t even know if I can take my things with me when I space-jump back. And there’s hardly any time left even now. Hello? Who is it? This is Greenrunner. Cycle courier. I have a delivery for Max Topas. Who sent you? A Madame Edda, from the funfair. I’m supposed to deliver a rucksack and a scooter. Super! Please leave it in the hallway. Thank you. Madame Edda, you’re the best! Monsieur Quidam? Monsieur Quidam? Young friend, this is a sacred place. I’ll thank you for not shouting in here. Please forgive me, but I’m looking for an acquaintance I’m supposed to meet in the crypt. A crypt? There is no crypt here at Saint Lambert’s Church. I'm sorry. You must have the wrong church. The Book of the Crystal Children in the crypt of Saint Lambert’s Church... crypt... Well, my young friend, you’re on time. I’m impressed! And this contains the Book of the Crystal Children? Marvellous. I knew I could rely on you! That wasn’t going to plan at all. And the morning had already turned my life upside-down. I was only just nine years old! Please continue with the story – it’s really exciting. What happened next in that church? I only had the plan that HAL had proposed in Dreamland. It was my only chance. But no way must Quidam be allowed to get hold of the rucksack before I’d been able to tell him a particular detail. So what did you do? Well, I immediately distracted him by being loud and cheeky. Under no circumstances must he open the rucksack. What’s with that nonsense? Why make me go to a crypt that doesn’t even exist? I wanted to check whether you had someone with you. But you obediently came to look for the crypt and in the end you even were a little sad. You’d better keep your hands off that rucksack! Is there no book in it? Or why shouldn’t I look inside? Yes, the book I brought you is in there. But we’ve safeguarded it with a special acid trap. An acid trap? What’s that supposed to be, little man? It’s no laughing matter. If you don’t open the rucksack in a certain way, an acid cartridge is activated and the Book of the Crystal Children is destroyed. I found the idea and the instructions on the Internet and I got all the materials from America. Wasn’t a problem for me to go there since I’m a Space-Jumper. And that’s why you should keep your hands off the rucksack. That’s a trick – you want to outsmart me, you tiny little boy? If you want to risk it, be my guest. But don’t be surprised afterwards if the book is gone forever. And how do you propose to handle the handover? First you take the spell off my family. Then you let me speak with them on the phone. And then I’ll open the rucksack for you. You are crazy. What if... ...you make a mistake and destroy the book? Or maybe it isn’t even in here? I won’t be outwitted by some little crystal boy! That’s not a problem. You could always put a spell on my family again if I tried to trick you or if the book is destroyed. That’s a good idea. That’s a plan I can live with. Hang on. Remove spell. You can now ring your father or mother. Do you have a phone? I’m sorry I don’t have one. Do you have the number? Yes, of course. Hello, Topas here, who’s calling? Papa! It's me, Max! Max? Daddy here! We’re at the airport and I have no idea why. We're on our way home now. Listen, I have no idea what happened... You see, they are on their way back. Now would you kindly open the rucksack! You can take the book out now. The book! Encyclopaedia of Secret Knowledge? Did you think you could fool me? It didn’t work? With the crystal? Well, I was much too young and there was too little time to make it work perfectly. And so I guess the crystal slid off the book, right down into the rucksack... Oh no! And then what happened? Please continue! Well, the plan didn’t really work out, but luckily I had another idea... Monsieur Quidam! What are you thinking? That’s just an old book. I needed it to stabilize the acid cartridge. The Book of the Crystal Children is really small, didn’t you know that? It’s still in the rucksack. It’s really small, is it? I always thought it would be something special. Right then, let’s have a look! He touched it! He touched the crystal! And that was the story, the way it actually happened? Yes. Exactly as it happened. But in the book they wrote about you, there’s a lot more that happened? Well, that’s just a novel. And to be perfectly honest, what really happened was quite enough for me. And how did you learn you are the first Crystal Child to retain your special abilities as an adult? That you are the first of a new and exceptional generation of Crystal Children? At first, I was ecstatic to have my family back and I didn’t want to have anything more to do with Dreamland and being a Crystal Child. I was shocked to the core by what had happened. All I wanted was to be a totally ordinary boy. Play soccer, stuff like that. You didn’t go back to Dreamland or do space-jumping? That’s right. Not for five months. But then I went to the Christmas market with my sister. You know what that is, a Christmas market? And then something unexpected happened... David! Vincy! What are you doing here? Max, Max – you never came back to Dreamland! We’ve only learned form Madame Edda that things turned out all right for you! Yes, I don’t want to go through anything like that again. All I want is to be a totally ordinary boy! But Max, we need your help! My help? Yes. Some of the Steamers are planning something really dreadful. What we know so far is this: there seems to be a very special clock called ‘The Clock of Time’... That’s why we’re here. We need your help. You’re a Space-Jumper and a very special Crystal Child. We can’t do this without you. It’s about all our future! Max, what do you say? Will you help us? Count me in! Vincy the Wise knew that you are someone special. Vincy the Wise knew it, presumably from Madame Edda, who had noticed it the first time we met. And that meeting with David and Vincy started everything that happened to you during the last few years. That day in July was very special, of course. But the third of December, at the Christmas market, that was the day when I did have to grow up, even though it was the last thing on my mind back then. The beginning of the great fight of the new-generation Crystal Children against the Steamers. A dispute that lasted for 40 years, until it ended seven years ago, luckily with the victory of the Crystal Children, the victory of good over evil. Yes, that sums it up perfectly. Max, many thanks for telling us this. Our classmates are eagerly awaiting our report. And we’re supposed to ask you one final question: Do you have any advice for our generation? Advice? Yes, I think I do. During my childhood, a lot of people were unbelievably pessimistic. Nationalism and egoism seemed to be the order of the day. Many were convinced that the world was going to destroy itself, one way or another. But the spirit of the young generation that opposed this eventually created the world as we know it today. So, maybe write this down for your readers. It’s something I’d wish all children and all grown-ups would adopt as the motto to live by: Just keep doing the right thing! Translation: Birgitta Wolf
