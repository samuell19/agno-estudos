Wh-What do you do, Miss Kimke? Uh... Well, I'm a nursing assistant. Now, suppose I came down to where you do that... Your hospital... It's a post-op facility. Okay. Well, suppose I came down there and I said, “You know, maybe not that medication, Ruth, maybe this one instead, don't ya think?” No, that's what... That's not what I meant by... You present a certainty that the owner of a vehicle you happened to see at a garage sale is the same individual who burglarized your home. - And... - His footprint.

I-I understand the chain of events as you tell them. Okay. Did it not occur to you that the people who had your computer in the first place were the same ones that broke into your home? - Yeah. But... - Occam's Razor and whatnot. What? Did it not occur to you that approaching a criminal suspect without official capacity is a good way to get your wig knocked off? Let me see your hand. - Can I see it? - It's nothing. Can I see it? That's what I thought. Yeah. What happened to your finger? Ruth, look at me. - Were you engaged in a confrontation? - No, it was an accident. Have you been able to replace your medications? - I see. I see. - I'll take that as a no. Okay. [scoffs] I mean, why...? Why do you not want to help me? - Help you? - Yeah. I just... Why...? - Isn't it your job? - My job. Yeah. I am doing my job. You're asking me about my job right now. - Yeah, I'm coming in here... - You come into my workplace... - I have things to help you... - and you ask me about my job. You think just because you left your door wide open for some punk to stroll right in, that the universe now somehow revolves around you? Well, grow up. We had a man beaten unconscious in his driveway. - That's awful. - Yeah, it's awful. And now... now, Ruth, he has skull fragments in his brain. The world is bigger than your silverware. People are experiencing bigger problems. There are people out there... [crying quietly] [sighs, panting] I'm, uh... I'm being divorced. First time I said it out loud. Sir, I'm very... Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm. Move it. Move the hand. Go home, Ruth. This is the guy. No, it is not. And if you engage in vigilante action or mess around with this again, I will be a bigger problem than your busted finger.

[car door closes] [doorbell rings] [laughing] Oh, excuse me. I just was... - Good morning, ma'am. I... - Police. Okay. May we have a moment of your time? Well, I don't see why not. [laughs] Come on in. Welcome to my home. Make yourselves comfortable. Go on in the sittin' room, sit on one of those couches. They're kinda new. They're real comfortable. - Can I get you a cup of coffee? - Not necessary. Um, no, thank you. It's no trouble. I just press a button on the machine... boop! It'll make a cappuccino too. It's like AI, like a spaceship. - Do you have cashew milk? - In that case... I think I can find something. [sighs] Any kind of nut milk is good? I like nut milk. You know, my niece Cameron, she can't have dairy, so I always have, like, hazelnut milk or... You know, they do this Brazil nut thing now. It's actually pretty good. I need to speak with Christian Rumack. - Is he here? - [laughs] Well, he is still out with his friends. I expect him back God knows when. Talk about what? Choices he made. [snorting laugh] Well, I ought to make sandwiches then because that could take all day. Like sandwiches? You hungry? I'm never hungry. I used to get hungry a lot, but I don't really get hungry anymore. Okay, here we go. Here you go, sweetie, with that nut milk. Thank you. - And here you go. - Thanks. You're welcome. - So, I was just wondering... - A machine did this? Mm-hmm. Yup. Huh. I worked at Borders for a while. Oh, the bookstore? Yeah, but they had a café too. I got pretty good with the steamer. - Mmm. - Could do smiley faces, winking faces. Certain kinds of centaurs, oak leaves, snowmen, diagram of an atom. - Wow. - Flaming swords, Kevin. - Quite a skill. - Do you know... - Hmm? - Christian's whereabouts the day before yesterday? [laughing] Oh, well... Honey, I barely know his whereabouts any day. But... he does have a job? Well, some would say that's all he has. - What's he do? - Mmm. Um... Lawyer, you know. [laughing] [snorting] [clears throat] Is he, uh... Is he in his van now? Oh. Oh, no, no, no, no. That's Chris Junior you're talking about. Yeah, Christian got him that van for his 16th if he got all B's. He flunked, but he got to keep it anyway. Just sayin'. Do you know where your son is now? Ooh, whoa. Stepson. I have no idea where he is. He got into drugs. He was in jail a little bit for that. And then he started hanging around with all the people he met in there. Bunch of creeps. His father recently cut him off. Canceled his ATM cards, everything. You know, TMI... Chrissy always made me kinda nervous... even before all that. Did you ever see The Omen? That little kid. Never know. - He'd just throw you down the stairs. - The hell is this? Oh! Well, the police are asking about Chrissy. Is that your shit box out front? - Yes, but... - Hands! - [cup shatters] - Put 'em up, now. Oh, people. Can you... [sighs] - Don't move. - Oh, my God. - [man] Clear! - Of course it's clear. - Meredith. - What? - Are you retarded? - What? Don't you dare use the “R” word around me! - [man] Master bedroom, clear! - Those are not police. Yeah, I know that. - Then why are you talking to them? - Because I'm fucking bored! [man] Massage room, clear! You are lucky all we're doing is talking. Don't flatter yourself, baby. Walden Pond room, clear! Well, I guess I will just get some soda for the rug. We're all clear. [clears throat] Come home to this shit. Okay. Who...? [Sighs] - Who are you? - I invoke the Fifth Amendment. - My name is Ruth... - [laughs] And why are you here? Your son broke into my house and stole my stuff. - [banging] - Knock it off! - Well, what... - [loud clattering] What does that have to do with me? I thought he lived here. So you impersonate cops, why? To find him in case he wasn't here. To what end? [Ruth] To confront him. “How dare you. Wah, wah.” Like that? Yeah. Yes. Exactly. You can't do that to people. You say that like it means something. Look, I don't condone my son's behavior, but anyone can do anything if you let them. Huh? Welcome to the world. I see why he turned out like he did. You have kids? Uh-uh. So you have no idea what you're talking about, do you? Christian has had more advantages and opportunities than 99.9% of the people on this planet. And that's because of me. So don't come to me with this nature-nurture horseshit. All right? How much? I don't want a payoff. Well, then I'm confused. What do you want? For people to not be assholes. Mm-hmm. Well, you know, it's probably gonna stain. - Are you gonna shoot us? - Don't be so goddamned dramatic. Then we'll leave. Thanks for the cappuccino. The foam was amazing. You are very welcome. You can tell yourself you've done something here, if that'll help. Really took a stand. You know what? Guys like that, that's just unhappiness eating 'em up. - You ought to feel sorry for him. - [door slams] [sighs] What are you doing? No, no, not the giraffe. Not the giraffe! Put it... Put the tiger down. Ruth, no, no. No, no, no. - Ruth, you gotta put that back. - I'm taking him. Why? [tires squealing] The fuck? I mean, fuck it. Let's just... do this. He's finally there now. I'm not doing a damn thing until I know their piece in this. They're on us yesterday, they're here today. She's ripping up yard art. You're gonna tell me you're comfortable with that? - No. - Wha...? We already got the security guy to think about. You wanna walk into some kind of dog fuck? Okay. - Fine. What am I supposed to do about it? - Fuck. Jesus. - Jesus. Fucking Christ. - Shut up. - Don't fucking throw bottles at me. - Shut up. - Fuck you. - [man] Both you, shut up. What? What do you mean, what? What's your problem? That's not your lawn tiger. - Did you hear that guy? - I heard him. But he's not the one that robbed your house, and that's not your lawn tiger. - If I'd known that this was gonna be... - I get it. - You know, the objective... - I get it. - Of the mission... - I get it. - I wouldn't have participated. - I get it. Thanks for the backup in there. The ba...? All I've done is back you up. Till now. [Tony] That's not your lawn tiger. [Ruth] Yeah, yeah. What would Jesus do, right? Tony...

He came out... You have such beautiful black little eyes. Okay. [hard rock, loud] He just ran right out. [Tony] What happened? [man] Some idiot ran in front of a bus. Ruth? Ruth? [screen door closes] You got it? - [gasps] No, no, no, no, no! - [gun clicks] You carry this one, okay? - Why? - [woman] 'Cause we're shorthanded. Which is on you. I just... It's not gonna... I think I should just stay here. I'm gonna be so quiet. I promise you, okay? No, this is what's gonna happen. You're gonna carry this gun, you're gonna get them to open the door. When they come to the door, point the gun at 'em so they don't do anything. I am not gonna be good at that. [man] We get what we need, and we get out, and that's it. How do I know that you're not gonna...? You know that I will if you don't. It's karma. For Chrissy. [doorbell buzzes] [man on intercom] Yes? Yes? Hi, it's... it's Ruth again. Sorry. Please don't do anything. I'm compliant. Why? Why, why, why? Don't. Stop. - You. - I'm so sorry. - This is... This is not my fault. - You took my tiger. - Yes, I did do that, but... - You're pointing a gun. - I know, I know, but... - Shut up! Meredith, do what they say. - Stop, stop. Don't. Stop! - Sit the fuck down. - Stop. - Oh, my... Don't do that. Okay. - This is unbelievable. - Where is he? He's sleeping one off. Call him. You know, if you're here for what you think you're here for, your timing stinks. Meredith, be quiet. Call him. [Ruth] Oh, just do it. Please. Please. Just... please. Please call him. Please. [scoffs] Oh, Chris! Chris! [Chris] What? Come here! [Chris] For what? Come... here! [door closes] Is Christian here? - [Meredith] No. - His van's parked out front. [whispers] Say something. Say something. [whispers] I don't know. Uh, maybe he's waiting for you to come outside. You know he doesn't like me too much. Cesar? Shh. [Whispers] Don't answer. What the fuck is going on? [gun clicks] [shouts] Okay. Everybody, just hold it. Stop doing that. Jesus. [Laughing] Wow. I know you. Marshall, right? Your name is Marshall! You were at one of Chrissy's hearings last year. Go ahead. Get in the fireplace. What...? What did he tell you? That I keep cash around here, huh? I haven't seen him in months. You amateurs, it's not even here anymore. Bullshit. [gun cocks] Get in the fireplace. [groans] [grunting] Chrissy told us about the iron in there, so don't even try that shit. [Chris] You got it all mapped out. - [groaning] - [mock groaning] [beeping] 4-3-2-1. - I'm a hostage. - [woman] Stop talking. They kidnapped me. They did this. You saw the gun was empty. You saw. Stop talking, bitch! - This is not... - Shut up! - Fuck. - [chuckles] Where's my son? [chuckles] You don't have a son, buddy. [Marshall laughs] - Guess that means we're done here. - What? No, no. No. Stop! I'm not letting you shoot anyone. Anyone... Anyone else. - You're gonna have to kill me first. - Okay. [gasps] Wh... [shouts] No, no, no! Ruth, Ruth! - Ooh! - [Ruth mutters] [gunfire] [gun clicking] Oh, Jesus. Ow! [coyote howling] Oh, God. Okay, quick. Come on. - [groaning] - Come on. - She got me good. - Come on. Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

[Marshall] Where are you? Tony? Tony? Dude. Wake up. Hey, hey, hey. Don't sleep. Don't sleep, Tony. Tony, Tony! Don't sleep. [Marshall] You better keep running! I see you! [motor starts] Tony? Dude? Come on. Get up, Tony, please. Come on. Tony. Wake up, Tony. Come on. Listen. Just apply pressure. Keep pressure. - I'll be back, okay? - [motor stops] Hey, fuck-face! [gun clicks] I'm gonna get you! Better run! Keep running! Here, kitty! Kitty, kitty! How fast can you run? Ha-ha. Run. Run! I see you! I'm gonna get you! [groaning] [Marshall mutters] Why don't you just leave me alone? Why don't I just leave you alone? Sure. Okay. All right. Sure. Why don't you come down here? And we'll shake on it. [Ruth] You do those tattoos yourself? Some. - Yeah? - Yeah. They look fucking stupid. What the fuck do you know? Have you ever eaten cat meat? You mean cat food? No. The meat... of a cat. No. No, man. I never ate any cat meat. Well, it makes you invisible.
