[muffled water sloshing] [ship creaking] [whispers] Go away. The weather looks fine. Shouldn't we be outside searching? Give us boats and we'll do the search ourselves. Please, do not go near the ship. Almost all of the bodies have been found. The search is over. Over? Just like that? Go kill yourself! [man] Are we all just going home? Be careful, Rita. What about my granddaughter? [crying] She can't stay outside. [woman sobbing] Isn't there any other way? I promise, we won't stop searching. [woman 2] Why is the Coast Guard leaving? [thunder rumbles] Please include me in the 10:30 a.m. boat. Of course, Mrs. Amado. [in English] Leana, thank you. [in Tagalog] You're welcome. I'll take over from here. -No, I can still do this. -No, you're very tired. When was the last time you ate? Why are you sad? It's over. Yes, it's over. Everyone is leaving. No one will ever come here. Who else will come when that thing is still out there in the water? Who will want to fish out there? [sobs] Money was already tight. And now this. -[sniffles] -Leana, maybe it's time to leave. We're leaving? It's sad here. Rita should go to a proper school. Just us? One of the guests offered me a job in Manila. You're leaving us? I have a family. I need a job. We're not leaving this place. This is all we have left. [thunder crashes] -Eddie! -What? Where is Mrs. Amado? -Why? Is anyone missing? -Just one. Let them catch up, okay? [Rita] Mrs. Amado! Let's go, Mrs. Amado. Mrs. Amado, it's time to leave. [man] Leana. Mr. Castro, your boat is leaving at 2:00. We hope you keep this place open for one more month. The Coast Guard has stopped the search. It's over. They're leaving. We will pay you. Please keep this place open. Open? Open for what? The current is strong under the Aurora. It will get even stronger when the storm comes. We think that... there are still a lot of bodies trapped inside the ship. There is a chance that the current will carry them here. Are you asking me to wait for bodies to come ashore? Fifty thousand for each body that you find. [choral music playing] I hope you didn't say yes. Leana. Don't give them hope. They are all grieving. Let's not disturb the dead. Let them rest. [Rita crying] Delia! -We'll see each other again, Rita. -[sobbing] Rita! What do you plan to do with this place? I'm not closing it yet. Maybe another... another month so... so I can clean up. I need to show you something. This was what they looked like. Crushed by metal. -[screams echoing] -Squashed by cargo. Drowned. Even if you get out, you have to swim in oil spills. [screams echoing] Flames. I don't know why you're showing me these. Because it's not your job to find them. You're not going to find anyone. If you're planning to look for help, let me remind you... the ship is off-limits. I have no plans. [door squeaks, closes] It's sad here. There's nothing to do. I miss Delia. Don't worry. We'll find fun things to do. Okay. Why don't you just teach me how to swim? Before Father died, he said he'd teach me. Can you teach me? I don't know how to swim, so don't go near the water, okay? That's not true! I saw you swim before. And you were so fast, like an elephant. -Elephants can swim. -[laughs] Elephants? And where'd you get that story? Are you making fun of me? It's true! Eddie told me. Well, that's not true. I don't know how to swim. So promise me that you won't go near the water, okay? Promise me! -I won't! -You won't promise? [laughs] -Elephants can swim! -No, they can't! [faintly] I'm not an elephant! -[Rita] You're an elephant! -You're not swimming! -You're an elephant! -[Leana laughing] I'm not an elephant! You're an elephant! [wind blowing] [rain pattering] [thunder rumbling] [eerie music playing] [rain pattering] [eerie music playing] [engine humming] [hammer banging] -How much? -[in English] Fifty. Twenty-five... Fifty! [in Tagalog] Here you go. [coins clink] Ricky. [exhales] Leana. You're closing shop, too? [Rita] I'm just gonna go there! Don't go too far. I'm done. No one's buying my fishing gear anymore. Uh, please, sit. How are you? [Ricky] How do you and Rita handle it? You're so close to that ship. We just stay inside. Anyway, they're done. The families have also left. That's great! [sighs] Even Delia left us. She's got a new job. Philip's leaving, too. He's a survivor. The only one from here who was a passenger of the Aurora. -He was there when it happened. -Philip, I didn't know. [scoffs] How about you guys? If you want, we can leave together. Delia said the same thing, but... we can't leave yet. How much is this? Uh, that's not for sale, but you can have it. [chuckles] It's okay, I'll pay for it. [thunder rumbling] [Rita] Wake up, Leana! They're back! Wake up! They've come back! Wake up! -Rita! -They're here! They've come back! Rita, throw that away. No. That will rot. It will stink. No, it won't. It's already dry. Look. Didn't I tell you not to go near the water? I didn't go near the water. [eerie music playing] [tinkling] Eddie... I'm thinking of doing business with you. Because you have your own boat. You can go near the ship once every day. I'll pay for your food and gas. Fifty thousand for each body we find. [sighs] -Your wife... -Cecile. If she wants, she can replace Delia here. Take care of Rita while I look for bodies that might wash ashore. You can search the waters. Are you not afraid? They won't look like this anymore. That's why I don't want Rita to see them. So if you find one, bring it to the boatshed. The Coast Guard forbids us from going near the ship. That's why you can't tell anyone about this. And never dive. [inhales] [Eddie] This is where I learned to swim and fish. I know these waters better than the Coast Guard. Okay. Fifty-fifty... for each body. [boat motor whirring] This place is beautiful. [Eddie] Of course! We should be thankful to Leana. The money will be a big help. [suspenseful music playing] I told him it's dangerous. [Cecile] Rita! -Rita! -Rita, go back inside. But I'm not gonna swim. I'm just here to watch Eddie. No one goes out. End of discussion! My goodness! There's nothing to do in this house. Why can't you just listen to your sister? Go back inside. [wind blowing] Whew! That's exhausting! There's nothing there. I told you not to go near the rocks. It's dangerous out there. That's not the problem. The problem is my gear. It's so old. Okay, we'll try again tomorrow. All right. Rita... sorry I was a bit cranky earlier. There's just a lot on my mind these days. It's very serious... what we're doing. It's okay. I know that you're searching for dead bodies. You're all right with that? It's okay. I also want them to go home. We will do our best. Okay. We will find them. They all want to go home. They want to ride in Eddie's boat. [ship creaking] [Leana] Sure. I doubt we'll find one today. -Bye. -Why can't Eddie and Cecile stay with us here? We have enough rooms upstairs. It's not that simple. Why? They have their own house. And we don't really know them that well. Mom and Dad wouldn't like that. It doesn't matter what they think. They're dead. Rita! Say sorry! Rita! [door closes] [faint thudding] [faint clattering] Rita? What's going on up there? [clattering continues] You're making a mess! Where did you get Dad's shoes? [sighs] [clicks tongue] [sighs] [shoes clatter] Rita! I don't have time for games. -[man panting, whimpering] -[suspenseful music playing] [shuddering] Why? Why don't you just do as I say? I'm closing off upstairs. It's not being used anyway. That's okay. It was just the wind. [man whispering] -[door creaks] -[keys jingle] [stairs creaking] [window creaking] Is that Cecile? She's with Rita. A window broke last night. The wind was so strong. I hope it gets even stronger so that ship will move. Even just a little nudge will do. Let's open this! Wait, wake your sister up first. Leana, wake up! Get up! Leana, look at this. [gasps] Wow! [Eddie] See? There's a lot. First, the flowers. Now these. The current really brings them back here from the Aurora. I helped! Right, Eddie? Oh, yeah! And you were so good! -Rita helped out. -Didn't I tell you... You were asleep and Cecile was upstairs. I locked all the rooms upstairs. I can give you the keys so you can get in. No need to. All the doors are open anyway. Even the windows. It's a mess up there. [Eddie] Next time, I'll buy a bigger net and bigger hooks so I can get more of these! Ricky sells fishing gear. You can buy from him. Sure. I'll go to him. I'll also bring the rest of the cargo so we can sell it. You're selling it? Of course! We'll sell it. That's money for us. Are you selling everything? Okay, not really everything. Go ahead and pick whatever you like. Can I? Please? Can I? -Can I? -I'll choose for you. Why can't I pick one for myself? Because it's not yours. [muffled water sloshing] You bought all that from selling the cargo? Here. Fifty-fifty split, right? Isn't that good? Are you diving? Why not? I know that ocean so well. -What about those rocks--? -Everything! Even the rocks! The undercurrent is so strong according to the Coast Guard. What if you get swept away or pulled under? Not today! Wait, if you're not going to help me, why don't you just babysit your sister? Don't wait up. What? Go on. It's getting late. See you later. Wow! Eddie, I'm taking this one. -What's that? -[in English] Noodles in a can. [in Tagalog] There are noodles in cans? [muffled dialogue] -Eddie, you're teasing me! -[laughter] Let's stop this. Enough. What? We are not here to look for luggage or cargo. We are getting paid to look for... to look for missing passengers. But this? It's stealing. I'm done. I just... I just want to find them because I made a promise. [inhales] These things were floating in the ocean. I just picked up some blessings. -What do you want me to do? -This isn't ours! We're taking advantage of the dead! [sighs] Leana, the money we earned was all used for the search! It was used to buy equipment and food! So we can go on with this! I'm sure the families want us to go on searching-- I want the search to continue because I promised! But I don't want to take from the dead. Fine, if you don't want to. You're perfect! I'm a thief. I have no problem with that. If you don't want these, I'll take it all. And everything else that I'm gonna get from that ship! Eddie. Eddie! -Eddie! Eddie! -[door opens] Leana... Ricky? [shushing echoes] [lights click] [man] Where is Leana? [woman] Leana! [man] With Ricky again? Grab the keys! [woman] Let's go! Hurry up! [engine humming] [tires screech, crashing] [wailing] [tires screech] What do you think, Ricky? I don't care about the money. You can have it. I have some savings left. I just really need your help. -But isn't this Eddie's job? -Mine. It's my job. I was the one who had a deal with the families. This is something else, Leana. I have to admit, I am scared. Always. But wouldn't it be better if we find all the missing? So this will all end. [suspenseful music playing] My God. [eerie music playing] [water dripping] [wind howling] [retching] [coughing, retching] -[coughing] -[Eddie coughing] I'll call the family. Which family? Anyone. No, no, no! Let's call the Coast Guard. -No! Don't. -[Ricky] What do you mean, "No"? -I was the one who found the dead body. -Idiot! The dead body found you! Oh, so I was found by that body? And how about you? You did nothing. You didn't even go into the water. You are such an idiot! If I hadn't pulled you, there'd be two of you lying dead inside! Stop it, you two! I'll take care of this. I'll find out who he is without causing trouble. No one should know we're searching for bodies. He stays here. Rita should never see this. Fifty thousand. If we split that three ways, how much will each of us get? You both can have the money. [wheels squeaking] [eerie music playing] [knocking] Rita? Rita. -Why did you sleep here? -Hi, Leana. Huh? [Rita grunts] I can't remember. Get up now and take a bath. Hello? -[in English] Mrs. Castro? -[in Tagalog] Did you find Melencia? Uh, not yet, but we found a man. Was there anyone who... I don't know how old he is. We can ask the other families. Who can this one be? What we know is that there were many... who were not on the ship's manifest. -Stowaways? -No, not stowaways. They paid and had tickets but weren't official. I don't understand. We think the Aurora was overloaded. As long as there's money to pay, anyone can get on board. It's a business. Many shipping companies do it. Is that legal? Everyone is involved. From the ship owners to... maybe even the captain. -Eddie, there's someone by the window. -Hmm? -There's someone inside. -What? -What's wrong? -I don't like it! -I don't want to go there. -What? I don't want to go in there! I don't like it! Take me back home! -Wait! What's wrong with you? -Take me back home! -Take me home! -Okay! Stop it! -All right! All right! -Take me home! -[whimpers] -[eerie music playing] [in English] "God sent the fish to save Jonah. Jonah stayed inside the belly of the fish for three days and three nights." [door rattling] [in Tagalog] Oh, Rita, your hands are so cold. I want to go inside now. Now you want to go back inside. -I still have so many things to do. -Like what? Rita. Do you want to go to the mainland? I have a few things to do at the municipal office. -I'll buy you a new dress. -Really? Yeah, right. [boat motor whirring] [indistinct chatter] Can I help you? Rita, can you stay there for a while? Is that for classified ads? Are you selling a house on the island? Uh... no. I'm looking for someone. Uh... Missing persons. From the Aurora? Candy, can you hand me the missing persons file? [Candy] Hold on. Here. Maybe in here? [woman] Try looking at these files. Everyone here is missing? The numbers went up after the Aurora tragedy. But not all of them are from here. We also get reports from other towns. Found anyone? The one we got-- Um, it's okay. I'm not really too sure. Okay, why don't you... leave your name, address, and your phone number? It's okay. Never mind. Thank you. Rita, let's go. Let's go home. [thunder rumbling] Leana! [man] Pay first before looking! No photos! [eerie music playing] [hammer banging] Rita. Yes? -Where are you going? -Just upstairs. Don't go inside 2A, okay? Rita? Rita, are you really not listening to me? -[hammer clatters] -[sighs] Rita. [thudding] [eerie music playing] [Rita] I know who you are! Your name is Benjamin. And you are famous! You're in the newspaper. I'll read it for you. "The famous seven-footer..." [in English] "'Boy Giant,' Benjamin David," [in Tagalog] "died of heart complications at the age of 28. Benjamin had a genetic disorder called 'gigantism.' A victim of constant bullying, he ran away from his hometown when he was still a teenager. [no audible dialogue] His father will bring his remains home via the passenger ship Aurora." [indistinct chatter] [man 1 whispers] It really is true. He's a giant. [man 2] Hey! Not too close. No photos! Just look, don't take photos. Hey! That's enough! Good thing we found you. -Now you can finally go home. -[eerie music playing] We will take you home. I don't want to go home. I'll never go home. [ship creaking] [Rita] Leana! Our guests are hungry. What should we feed them? Leana! Our guests are hungry. What should we feed them? [knocking on door] Philip. I just wanted to know... what really happened to the Aurora? When are you leaving? I'll come with you. [sobs] [indistinct chattering] [Philip] We were packed like sardines on that ship. There were too many passengers. It was chaotic. I even had a hard time standing up. The Aurora was overloaded! And then the ship smashed into the rocks, like this! Do you know anyone who died? A man who died on the ship? Many people died. But maybe you will remember this one. He was tall, uh, like a giant. How did you know about that? [sighs] There was a dead body aboard the ship. He was like a giant. The ship's crew was saying it was bad luck. But a lot of passengers and crew still came to see him. All the strange things that happened on the ship, they blamed it on the dead man. Blackouts. Temperatures dropping very low. They said it was because of him. The crew said that the dead man didn't want to go home. But some said that they saw him around the ship. They're just stories the crew made up to scare the kids, to keep them from being rowdy. No one knows. [sobbing] I don't know! [in English] Human error. [sniffles] Suicide. [suspenseful music playing] [crashing] -[electricity crackles] -[woman screams] -[in Tagalog] Help! -[clamoring, screaming] What's happening? [man grunting] [woman whimpering] -[baby crying] -[man grunting] [sighs] [sniffles] All I know is that... the last thing I saw was Leana's seaside inn. It seemed so near. -[crashing] -[people screaming] [Philip] I jumped. A lot of people did. I thought it'd be easy to swim. [sobs] But the sea was on fire. [people screaming] [woman whimpering] [Philip] I thought I saw the giant, the dead man... on the bridge... with the captain. Leana... [boat motor whirring] -[motor turns off] -[thunder rumbling] [thunder crashing] [Leana exhales] [gasps] [eerie music playing] [door closes] [grunts] [panting] -[Leana] Rita. -[Rita groans] [Leana grunts] I feel so cold. [Leana] Let's get out. -[gasping] -[whimpers] [both whimpering] [Rita whimpers, gasps] [both grunt] Are you okay? [Rita whimpering] When the water rises, take a deep breath. -Hold it as long as you can. -Like this? [inhales] And never leave my side, okay? [electricity crackling] [lights click] -[boy] Mama. -[woman] Shh. [woman] We're just near the shore. Do you see that big house over there? Shh. [captain in English over PA] This is your captain speaking. [captain in Tagalog] We have a minor engine problem. [Leana gasps] [both panting] [captain over PA] Wait for further instructions. [Rita whimpering] [captain in English over PA] This is your captain speaking. [captain in Tagalog] We have a minor engine problem. Please stay where you are and put on your life jackets. Wait for further instructions. -[ship rumbling] -[clamoring] [people gasping, screaming] [man screaming] [woman] My child's missing! [Rita whimpering, crying] -[electricity crackles] -[girl crying] [all screaming] [Rita gasps] -[electricity crackles] -[Leana whimpering] [people screaming] [captain in English over PA] This is your captain speaking. [captain in Tagalog] We have a minor engine problem. Please stay where you are and put on your life jackets. [grunting] [grunts] [captain in English over PA] This is your captain speaking. [captain in Tagalog] We have a minor engine problem. Please stay where you are and put on your life jackets. Wait for further instructions. [Rita whimpering] [Rita panting] [thunder rumbling] [people whispering] -Where are we? -Hold tight. [Leana gasps] [whispering] [Rita in English] One... two... three... four... five... six... seven... ...25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30... -Forty... -[Leana in Tagalog] Ma'am, they're here. -Fifty... -[Mrs. Amado] Leana? -Melencia... I saw them. -[Rita continues counting] [Mrs. Amado] Where is she? -Leana? -[Rita whimpers] Please call the Coast Guard. Please call the families. They are all back. -All of the missing. -Leana! They've returned. Leana! Leana! Leana... [whispering continues] [eerie music playing] [gasps] [Rita] Leana! -Rita! -Leana! -Rita! -[people screaming] -Rita! -Leana! -Leana! -Rita! Rita! -Rita! -Leana! Rita! Rita! Rita! Leana! Leana! Leana! Leana! Leana! Leana! Leana! [ship creaking] [gasps] Leana! Leana! Leana! [gasps] [choral music playing] Look. The Aurora is gone. There were still many more of them. So crowded. [voice breaking] They were screaming, crying for help, but nobody came. -What? -Some were in the cargo hold. There were children and babies. They were trapped. The crew forgot about them. Leana, how do you know this? What happened here? [in English] Mrs. Castro... [in Tagalog] there were still so many dead on the ship. And you knew all about it. That's why you didn't want us to go near the ship. She's gone mad. I already warned you, didn't I? That a storm was coming. Aurora was overloaded. So many people weren't listed on the manifest. -Are you saying I'm a part of it? -Yes. You, including the captain. Leana. I saw them, too. Where are they? They're all inside. I'm sorry, Leana, but I don't know what you're talking about. [Mrs. Amado] They're inside. Come on, let's go. [woman] They're in here. [sad music playing] [people wailing] Why? Wake up! [wailing continues] It's over. Leana... Thank you. I'll go in and help. [wailing continues] [wailing continues] Go home. Leana? What did you say? Nothing. It was just the wind. [eerie music playing]
