Yes, if you want I can pass hm to you. It's David. David? Yeah, I usually don't answer private numbers. They're here with me, yes. You wanna come around? Of course, you can come around.

See you soon. Bye. Bye. See you soon. I already asked you not to smoke here, didn't I? Sorry! If all goes well, It's two hours on the road until we meet for the first time in ten years. I bet you weren't expecting that. This one, you weren't expecting'.! A two hour trip... Enough time for me to talk with you, as if you were here with me. On the passenger's seat. You see... I'm not coming over... to have a few drinks, and get sun burnt near the pool. No! That's not why I'm gonna come over to you. It's not out of nostalgia... I've thought of writing you an e-mail... a letter... But I doubt you'd read any word of it. Because". even asking for forgiveness in a letter is net the same as asking for forgiveness, in front of you. And you need me to do that. You need to see me cry, to see me suffer. Right? As if my pain finally gave you a reason, for these hellish ten years. Do you have someone? I just want to arrive and see that you're unmarried, and childless. That you're unfulfilled. That you have nothing settled for once you return to Lisbon. Neither for tomorrow, nor for the next twenty years. Good morning! ...Good morning. ... Good morning... Sorry... Do you want...? I do. Just a little bit. Thank you. You want some, Sim?o? I'll have a yoghurt. For now. Do you guys know what you wanna do today? Joana? Sim?o? Joana... I dunno, Vasco said there was a farm nearby that rents horses. Maybe we could go for a ride. We could go to the beach. Must be full, today is weekend. Sim?o? You go ahead, I'll stay. No, no, no. Either we're all going, or none of us are. I'm not In the mood. Can you pass me the coffee? Thank you. I'm clue to deliver the first draft to the company in three weeks. And when does the shooting begin? It's better if you don't know. ...You want some? ... No, it's much too soon for me. Tell me something: why don' you ask Francisco to lend his house? You'd stay here. I'm sure he wouldn't mind. Em... the sun... the pooh. And flies. Do you really think someone can write something here? Depends on the thing. It's the first time you don't tell me anything. Not even a line. You used to give me all your screenplays for me to read. It's a pornographic film, a heterosexual one with nuns. I doubt you'd have any interest. Hi, it's me. Yes, it's fine, yes. I miss you too. We come back... I mean, I'm be back tomorrow night. Sim?o is gonna stay. My voice? No, nothings wrong} I just called to say hi and I love you very much. Yes, we have internet. Alright. I'll turn on my computer later if you want and we can chat on Skype. Talk to you later. Yes, I'll text you. Kisses. Sim?o, I'm going to the village. Do you want anything? ...Bring me a pack of cigarettes. ... Ole. Don't let Joana fall asleep in the sun. ...Did you hear that, Joana? ... Yes. ...Call me if you need anything. ... Okay. ...Let me work! ... Only If you let me read. No! You'|\ watch It in the cinema, when it premieres. This film is about him, isn't it? Have you thought about who's going to play me? Let me guess. Emma Stone. You wish. Actually, I think I'm a lot cuter than her. How about David? Any Ideas? No. I'm give you three choices. Ryan Gosling. Ryan Reynolds. Chico Buarque. Chico Buarque? Chico Buarque is old enough to be our clad. Darling, there are people who are ageless! Have you wondered what he's gonna do here? Relive memories. See how we're doing. It's been eight...? Ten years. I remember very well the day I said goodbye at the airport. You never spoke to him again? I sent hm a few messages, but he never replied. How about today? Did he reply? Here. I thought you'd already stopped. ...Does it work? ... Let me try. No. I'm buy a new one when I get to Lisbon. He knows... David knows. Thank you, Saint Rita of Cascia. My saint of impossible causes. Thank you. Thank you for hearing my prayers. He's back. He's returned. He's coming. Everything okay? It's not "sunburn... It's... heatstroke?. Isolation, fever. In fact, film titles have never been your strong point. I know nothing of what happened to you. I preferred 'st this way. It was for the better. I don't see you anywhere. I don't keep any photograph of you. Nor do I search you amine. We destroyed everything that remained, even the inscriptions of the books you gave me every birthday and Christmas,. I tore them and they ended up in the trash, like some presents. I suppose you've done the same. None of us was honest, and today we piously believe so. But time tends to erase the bad things we do, as if it was the only way to save the life that's left to live. Why do we he so much, when we love someone? When you left Through that door You told me my love, It's Sate, it doesn't matter You 7/ find it too A new love Sim?o... When you left Through that door You saw me in front of a mirror Perplex and exposed. And I cried to the Gods To swoop you up With my pain...! I've turned the night Into my home I've loved a thousand men... Until dawn Until you returned With your eyes mu of sorrow And your cry... Now I Want to see you Search for me, and feel regret Now I want to see... Now I Want to see you Look back, and feel humiliated [know Why...! Do you stiff think of me When you fuck with him? And, do you still think of me, Think of me? I know you do, I know you do, I know you do. When you left Through that door And you told me my love it doesn't matter You 7/ find it too, A new love. Are you really going to make a movie about us? Yes. But don't worry, I'll change the names. No one will know ifs you. Can you believe I still think about him when I'm fucking other guys? No, no, no. The road is open, I checked. Yes, the fire is on the other side of the woods, you can come. What I wanted to tell you, is that... if you want me to, I can tell them to go. No, why? Hello, hello? Hello? Does David know he was institutionalized? I don't think so. Why don' you call Mariana? Aren't you curious to know? Why don't you call her? Aren't you her friend? Call her. No. I don't know her all that well. Besides, he must be arriving... and that's that. Must be nothing. And what if he comes because of Sim?o? Sometimes, I wake up in the middle of the night. ? As if you were there, and we both speak, and you reply. Sometimes, I close my eyes, and I can feel your smell... and see your lips, and kiss you, the way we used to kiss. Do you remember? Kiss me, David. Kiss me. Take me and tell me you love me... Or if you don't love me, that you pretend that you stay with men... For I die every day, at the same time. At this time of day,. I hate the end of the day. When the sun gees dawn, right before the night. Kiss me, David. Save me. Fuck me. The world needs tenderness, and to fuck, is to make tenderness possible. Do you still want it? I do. What about you? What's wrong, Joana? Nothing. ...I was wondering if it's not too early... ... Too early? Sorry, you're right. Seriously, don't do that. ...He called me. ... So what, he called everyone. Including me. ...You're telling me that doesn't change anything? No! Promise me! ...No, seriously don't do it, Joana ... Then, promise me! Promise me, that no matter what happens, our deal ts stilt on} You promise me, then. Come on! Promise me} I don't know! Okay, I don't know if I can do It! ...It was going too well, wasn't it? ... It Isl If all was well, we wouldn't be arguing because of a phone call. It is not just some phone call, and you know it! ...What If he's coming for you? ... What? ...You're gonna tell me It hasn't crossed your mind yet?... Nonsense[ Don't He! Don't He! Okay, let's assume that's the case. What does it have to do with anything? ...It doesn't? ... No! It's the man of your life! ...It's the man I had sex with[ ... What you did was really ugly. ...But we have gotten past that. We moved on! ... Life is ugly, Chico! Life is ugly, Chico. That's why people have children. Get out! Get out! What happened? Joana, what happened? It was nothing, I'm be fine. ...Has David arrived yet? ... No, no. What am I doing here, Sim?o? You're the one who knows me better than everyone else. Tell me... Why do I always fall in love with men who I can't have? Darling! Come here, come here. My ex was right. When I have a child, Bergman at age 6 and Tarkovsky at 8. So there will be no illusions. ...Francisco is waiting for him. ... I know. I should have gotten out of your lives after David left. Why did you break up with him? You never told me. You and Francisco have a plan. I have a movie to make. Vasco is getting to know someone. Whether good or bad, everyone recovered after he left. Nothing like a joint to cool off. Pretty heavy mood today. And I don't feel like arguing during the whole weekend. Joana, you want a drink? Dry martini, that's her favorite drink. Sure. ...Where's Sim?o? ... He's just changing. ...Do you still talk to him? ... Yes. He said we're gonna go for a coffee this week. ...How long has that been going on? ... Six months. 6 months just to get laid? Seriously? ...He's got a very complicated life. ... We know, a wife and children. With so many lonely fairies on the internet looking for a husband... Really? He said we're gonna have coffee this week and Ts gonna happen this week. I don't understand how can you like hm if you've never seen hm? I see hm every day... on Skype. That wouldn't work for me. Skype? Francisco, not everyone is like you. A few words on the internet and after a couple of minutes there's a guy knocking at your door. Manet is a different man, serious, responsible, he wants to do things the right way. And that's it. It's not like he gets around and then just leaves. Manel is different and I like him that way, okay? I really don't give a shit about the whole gay culture thing. The gay scene, gay night, gay parties... For God's sake, It's always the same thing! Who screwed who, who got some ass, who took it up the ass, how many they did... Who bought this car or that house. Who went to Ibiza, who took more drugs... For Gods sake! You think because you're dating... deluded with a married man ...who, by the way, can't wait to cheat on his wife with a man... do you really think that makes you the Virgin Mary? I'd appreciate if you didn't refer to me as a woman, Chico. ...It's quite offensive. ... Offensive is the way you think. You're gonna tell me that a man who screws a lot of men is a whore? Isn't he? My therapist says... "... if people feel love, it's because there's still love on the other side. " Nobody loves alone. It was she who made me come here, do you believe that? She told me: "Take flight and go there. "Tell him what 'st is you've got to say and finish this once and for all. ?Be happy, David. "Embrace the idea that you can be happy,. ?You've got 45 years, you can? lose anymore time. ...Time is something we don't have after we hit 40. "Time to believe that the meaning of life is still absolute, and not just consolation. "You're not a person who likes consolation. ? When you find cut that I'm doing therapy... Me, who of all people, didn't believe that stuff. I always had the antidote for depressions. Mikonos in the Summer, Rio de Janeiro on New Year's Eve, and Madrid on Gay Pride. They were all things you loathed... Don't worry. I don't insist much now, either. Not that it has turned me in a 40-something bore, but rather that I've stopped believing in joy. Asked to marry him, right in the middle of Largo Camoes. He looked so slow-witted Speaking of marriage, I wonder if David got married? He used to talk so much about it. You goofball! I'm getting a new car this week, my Smart is on its last legs. Maybe he got married. He got married and 'rs coming to Introduce us his wife. ...What a dumb idea. ... Why? He talked about it a lot. Did he ask you to marry hm? No, but he told me he'd like to get married... ...after he found the right man. Or the right woman. ...(Heady it wasn't one of us. ... How do you know? Like a good \aw yer, Vasco is trying to get one of us to take the bait. ...Sorry, Francisco, I didn't get that. ... You didn't? Yeah, right. Only in this case, my dear Vasco, you and your arguments are useless. He's entitled to his opinion, Chico. A lot happened between the time you and I dated him. You were with him, for what, 6 months? For God's sake! Get a grip, Vasco! 18 months, Chico. A year and a half. And its doesn't matter how long you're with someone, it matters what you've experienced. That's why he left you. Like this, in the click of a finger! Got fed up with the drama from a fairy who never came out of the closet. Don't be ridiculous} You're such a jerk. I didn't know you had ownership rights on him. For your information, he called everyone here before he called you. Vasco! Don't go there. Did he also call you, Sim?o? He called me, Francisco! He tried to talk to me. So don't put yourself in a place where you don't belong. You're not gonna call him? ...Let him be. ... Go easy on him. Francisco, come to the table. Come on. ...Stop it, guys! ... Enough! Enough, man! Take him Inside, Joana[ ...I'll knock you out! ... Are you insane?! Did you hear what he said? He shouldn't have said those things! Like what? You don't understand, Sim?o. ...I don't? Why not? What is it that we don't understand that makes you the only one who does? David fucked me over twice. The second time was you. ...Be still! ... Sorry, Joana. ...Hurry up, I wanna pack and \eave. ... Don't be an idiot! Don't be an idiot?! You saw what he did to me? I'm not staying in this shitty house any longer. Fuck. What will I say at the office? That you were In a fight. You can already see it. ...What? ... Time. It's in our faces... everything. Even the things that didn't happen. I've made a list of questions... you know I've never been one for conversations. But this time, I've made a fist of things I have to say. and some questions Yd Kike for you to answer. I know all toe well that I've never made you happy... Neither you, nor anyone. It's a quality of mine... to destroy the lives of everyone around me. Yet... Fa' stiff like to know if what you used to say was true. You see... sometimes words turn into gigantic things. I know how that's like. I must've said a lot:... I love you! ", just not to fee! lonely. Did you do the same thing? When you told me you loved me, was is it true, or just to make-believe, that we were like other people? Francisco! He's leaving. You're not gonna do anything? Vasco! Forget about Francisco. Seriously. He'll get over it. But don't leave, I'm sure he wants you to stay. Give him a chance to apologize. ...Joana... ... To explain himself. Joana, please don't make things harder. We can talk about this later if you want, but fight now let me go back to Lisbon. You know what I think? What? Say it. That this ts a great opportunity for you to leave. That's nonsense, Joana. If you wanna stay in this stow death, waiting for the guy, that's on you. Just don't ask me to pretend nothing happened. ...What if he gets here? ... I don't give a damn, Joana} I don't give a damn if it's been ten years! I don't give a damn! There are things you don't forget. Do you understand that? Now please, let me go. What if he gets here and says, "I know I've done a tot of shit, ...I know it's been ten years, but I could never forget you "and I want to try again... Because of this guy, I never trusted anyone again. People are evil, Joana. They may even have the best of intentions, but they always end up hurting others. Remember how he broke up with me? With a fucking text message. You were in love with him. I remember that. I never told you. I never told because 'it seems that the more you talk about things, the more they stay with you. I was pregnant with David's baby. I found out three weeks after he left for Brazil. There are things that kill us on the inside. I died Inside. You place two pills here and then you wait for the body to expel... Sorry. We're very similar. We think we can control everything. Control life as if it were an Excel spreadsheet. I could've had a child with any of the guys I've dated, but I couldn't have a child with a guy who was desperate. And David was desperate because Sim?o had clumped him. I'm tired of being alone. I'm tired. ...What have you done? ... I've sent him a message. What did it say? For hm not to come. ...When you and David broke up... ... We never broke up, Vasco. That's right, we never broke up. We were very young, 18 or 19, when If ell in love with him and we started dating. And I thought that was it. That my life would be like that forever. Even though I knew he was screwing other guys. One day we were coming back from the beach, I remember there was horrible traffic, and we were stuck for hours. And I brought it up. Deep down I didn't want to break up at all, just wanted to see how much he'd miss me if I left. And I suggested we give It a break. He looked at me, winked and said yes, anything I wanted. It was the worst car ride of my life. From that day on, things were never the same again. Until this one clay, when he called to give me the good news. He had a new boyfriend and really wanted me to meet him. ...That boyfriend... ... I can't even remember. It was only after that he started dating Sim?o. And from that point you know the whole story. Se, no. We never broke up. Years later, after he was clone with Sim?o, we went out for dinner. Do you remember the time he had that Asia phase and wanted to move to Vietnam? Anyway. We had dinner, got wasted on sak?, then we went to Bairro Alto to drink some more. And when I took him home, I stopped at his door, he grabbed me, kissed me and told me, "Whatever happens, you'll always be the man of my life, "but now I have to live it... The... it" was you. He got out the car, closed the door and that was the last time we were alone. That doesn't invalidate what we experienced together. I know, I know. Sorry. It was very selfish. Very. It's gonna take him longer. The roads are closed because of the fire, he'll have to take a longer route. Manel, no, I haven't met anyone new. That's exactly the problem. I haven't had anyone beside me for so long and it's time, Manel. If you ever divorce your wife, the last thing you're going to want is to be with a guy. Manel, you're going to discover so much. So much. And I... have already clone all that. I did that when I was 20 Different? No, I'm not different. No, this cannot go any longer. Of course I understand your side, but you've gotta understand mine. I don't believe that... I don't believe It, I'm sorry! You've been telling me that for months, but then you never have the time. Manel, look... If you really wanted to meet me, you'd have already gotten yourself to come to me. I know, but that's not my problem, that's your problem! Maw... I'm being selfish? No, Manel, but I have to think of myself... I want to have someone who's always there for me. Not a ghost. Manel, for that, I've already got my own ghosts. I don't need... I don't need to have another ghost besides me, do you understand? "SUNBURN" What? ...Nothing. ... Spill it out. Nothing. I was just staring at you. Watch out, that can be dangerous. I know. Fuck. I bought a sea bream, and forgot he hates eating fish. Have you told hm? About what, us? No, I haven't... Mariana might... She knows. They were together. ...What about Sim?o? ... Sim?o would never tell. Why not? That's between us. If it's a boy, we'll call him Francisco. What if it's a girl? Or twins? What if I can't get pregnant? I came to pick up the tupperware from lunch, I forgot them. Oh. ...Is Francisco here? ... He can't right now. Okay. Maybe I'm come back later. What's your name? Paulo. ...I've never seen you around. ... It's my first time here. Of course. Paulo, nice to meet you. I'm Vasco. ...Look at you, huh? ... What? ...You must go to the gym a lot. ... No, only when I can. ...You guys really like that, right? ... You guys? Yeah, you guys- We like a lot of that and other things... Don't get me wrong, It's your business. ...I have nothing against it. ... No, that's fine. No problem. Anything else you need besides the tupperware? No, no... I'm be back tater. It's better that way. Think about it. I don't want you to leave empty-handed. Easy! Easy! Slow down! Not here. Easy! I've never done this before} Shush. Quiet. Quiet. ...Who was that? ... The boy from the restaurant. He came to check If we needed anything. ...What did you do? ... Nothing he didn't want to. What about Manel? It's like Francisco said, we talk on the phone and then I jerk off in front of the computer screen. ...Don't say that. ... Why not? Why can't I be like you? Fucking and dating. Having fun. Enjoying life, going to Ibiza... Because you're not like that, you never were. Doing what others do is not a shortcut to being happy. You could write self-help books. You'd make a fortune. I can't. You know I rarely do what I say. Why did you break up with him? Anyway, it's not important. What's important is for him to show up once and for all to end this stupid anxiety. We look like four school kids the clay before prom. I broke up with him because he wanted the same as you. The same as me, what do you mean? To get married, have children. He even got an interview with a social worker. Then he got it in his mind that we were gonna get a surrogate mother tn the States. He had money. But I said no. I didn't want to get married, didn't want children either. I didn't want to go through the same ordeal I had with my parents. I mean, with my father because my mother 'rs stilt nowhere to be seen. Was that it? I broke up with him for the same reasons that would've made you stay. I think we both need a drink. Sim?o? Sim?o! ...What happened? ... Have you seen him? Who? Sim?o, he was here and just disappeared. ...Maybe he went inside. ... No, he didn't. He disappeared. Sim?o! ...What's going on now? ... It's Sim?o. ...He must be In the bathroom ... He's not! What did you tell hm? He was telling me why he and David broke up, I went inside to get two glasses of wine and when I came back, he was gone. Sim?o! What did he tell you? I'm check if he's inside. They broke up because... Sim?o! Because? Sim?o! Tell me! Why? Tell me! Because David wanted to be a dad and he didn't. He's not Inside. Sim?o! Sim?o! Sim?o! If I knew what I know today, everything would've been different,. Everything. Do I still have time? Do we still have time to reshape the past? We made you suffer so much... But, you see, it was impossible far me to be indifferent to what you'd done to me. Maybe not, maybe you don't understand,. It's like the tale of the boy who cried waif,. We never forgive the treacherous innocence, don't we? It's necessary to sacrifice something, and between us, innocence was only the title of a brazillian soap opera, one of those you loved to watch Sunday morning, with pizza and coke. Our story has aged like one of those seen in the soap operas, sweetheart. A cliche'! Who'd have thought... ' We Wanted so much to be different, that it all ended up becoming an enormous cliche. The five of us were so modern and old at the same time. That's what happens, when you go to first communion, join the scouts, go to church, confess your sins to the priest... And you dream of marriage, and kids, and the Last Rites. Boy meets world, world fucks boy, boy goes nuts... boy kills himself,. Sim?o! Sim?o! There's no turning back, right? What? There's things we do that we can't turn back. Sim?o, it wasn't your fault. It was me who didn't want to have that child. He also tried to call me. I didn't pick up, so he texted me. He missed me and really needed to talk to me. And you? No. For the first time in my life, I didn't. Sim?o! Should I set the table outside or inside? ...Let's eat outside, It's not windy. ... I say we eat here. What do you think, Sim?o? Should we have dinner here or outside? Turkey? That's all we have. Unless we cook the sea Dream. Sea Dream. Don't you agree, Joana? I do. Okay. ...Do you need help? ... No, it's all good. Okay. ...Keep an eye on him. ... I know. Hello? Yeah, where are you? No, you don't need to do anything. We already have everything. Okay, see you soon. Bye. Bye. See you soon. Half an hour, 40 minutes. Maybe someday, I'll find you somewhere To fool myself, To make me smile Maybe someday, I'm find you Only if I implore you, You'll tell me lies, for me to dream And in the sweet flow of the Samba, I lost myself in a Whirl, And no... Never to come back again And 'sf you wanna dance, And if you wanna dance, I can teach you, The cadence of Samba The cadence of Samba I'm gonna call lansa, Ogum, And I hope to God I'm gonna make a macumba To love you You bastard I'm gonna make, I'm gonna make wish you a life Of disappointment I don't wish you fondness Or forgiveness And may you be happy With whoever you find, but...

It's not like that... ...I'm in the mood... ... You're in the mood, but I'm not. But I thought you guys... You guys. Did you already forget my name? I have a name. Don't you remember it? Do you wanna go back there? No. But where do we stand? We don't. You should leave. 976374595. Wanna write it down? It's okay. I have a good memory.

I'm have some wine. Are you having anything? I'm have a glass. No, wait. Better not. ...Why not? ... Nothing, let's talk later. ...Shall I put on some music? ... Sure. Are you alright? Yes, of course. Everything's perfect. ...Do you want something to drink? ... What are you drinking? White wine, Joana isn't drinking anything. ...I don't understand. ... Sure. Thank you. ...Where's Vasco? ... I don't know. Davids here. Search for another woman, For me, you were a bonfire Who do you think you are? And the longing turned into a cut Search for another woman, One for you to manipulate and sow What you Want Someone for you to leave, To play that crazy game of submission And then you'?! say, And you?! find me again On that same bar And then you?! lose, Without wanting to humiliate yourself My bandit with a hurt pride Whispering, Clinging to my feet And you'll say you still want me When you see me embraced by another paramour Search for another woman For me, You're the past
