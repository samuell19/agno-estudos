All right, all right. I certainly hope not. Excuse me? I fuckin' hate baseball. [laughing and snorting] I'm gonna go open this. [Ron] That's a Buick. -Right? -I've never- Hey, if it isn't the athlete. Thanks for gracing us with your presence. Oh, apologies. On the call with a client. It was... Gentlemen, I'll keep this brief. The Albright case is the biggest one we've had in quite a while. High visibility and we're gonna have to devote a lot of resources. Tom, I want you to take the lead. You seem to have developed a rapport with their general counsel already. Ron, we need you on this, too. We may have to pull you off of the tower expansion project. But we already know how well you two work together. Well, we-- we really appreciate that, sir. Save it. Go. Do your job. -It's great to see you. -Yes. Presents! Oh! Okay, thank you!

Well, is the bachelor comin' over for some home cookin' tonight? Jen already invited me. Jen invited- It's- Ron, it's Thursday. It's a standin' invite I- I get credit for that invitation. [Ron] You know, she's goin' real heavy on the spices lately. Is that a pregnancy thing? Yes, it is a pregnancy- Uh, we got Lamaze tonight, by the way, so I gotta leave early. Maybe you skip out too, early dinner, catch the game after. -Well, shit, man. You know what I can-- -Yo, what's up, guys? -Hey. -Hey. Hey, is that, uh, the intern? You kidding me? Yeah. Walt. Fucking Walt? Ron, I didn't say you had to be the guy's dad or anything. I don't know, man. I think he needs it, Tom. We could play horse or some shit, huh? -No. -I'm good. -Thanks for the invite. -Yeah, man. You're welcome, man. -It's gonna be good for you. -Yeah! [Ron] He's my best friend, but I like to see him lose every once in a while. -How do you feel about that? -[Walt] Feel good, man. That's what I'm talkin' about. Look, look, look... -I know, I know. -He plays ball, too. -He does. He does- Hey. -Just watch the elbow. We can argue that they bought up the property debt not as a lender, but to actually foreclose on the properties. [man on phone] You're right, God damn it. We might have something here. This might be one hell of an idea. I totally agree. Hey, listen. Let's end it right there and, uh, I guess we'll continue when I see you in person on Tuesday. Thanks, Mike. And to you too as well, Tom. - Speak soon. -Thank you. Yes, Tom! Yes! Nice. -Nice. -Thank you, sir, for just giving me the opportunity. -I really, I appreciate it. Thank you. -Thank you. Uh, I actually have to run, if that's all right. Uh, Lamaze class. Huh. [woman] All right. If you want to just sit and find a place to relax... How are you, baby? You good? Feelin' good? [woman] We'll wait a few more minutes. We went a little heavy on the paprika tonight, no? -Did we? -Mm-hm. Mm, [tasting] I don't think it's bad. Hey, team. Smells really good. I am starving. -There's the man. Hey. -Hey, man. Hey. Man. Hey, babe. Um, God, I'm sorry. I- I thought Alex was gonna give you the message. She did, uh, about ten minutes into class. -Oh. -Uh, babe, I can't have this kid on my own. That's, that's not funny. I actually think I'm gonna be done with the Lamaze thing. I get it. It's easy. You're-- you're just done with it. Yeah, yeah. I'm ready. Yep. The woman has spoken. I think you should just... 'Kay. Well, I-- I'm just not sure you understand the repercussions when I have to leave a lot of people at work, I mean, I made it to-- Ron would-- would get what I'm talkin'- -Are you really gonna come at me about this? I said I'm sorry. -No, no. I'm not. It's not-- I'm sorry. Okay. -Salad. -Yeah. Thanks, brother. Um, this looks awesome. [sighing] My God, I'm just worried that Ron's gonna be that guy in his fifties that's still single. Boom. -Yeah. -Right? It's not bad. [clearing her throat] -Yeah. -Thank you. Thank you. No, R-- Ron'll find the right woman, and he will settle down. How do you know? Because I did. And I'm basically like the white version of Ron, and we're like the same... Oh! Did you feel that right there? -Mm-hm. Yeah. -He kicked, right? Is-- Has he been kickin' a lot, like, like more than normal, has he been kicking? [chucking] Babe, it's almost ready. 'Kay. -Babe? -Yeah. What's up? Have you seen my phone? -I have not seen your phone. -Okay. -It's probably in your car. -Oh. Do you wanna get it? I do want to get it in a couple minutes 'cause this is almost ready. Okay. Mm. -Oh, you are so good. You are so good. -Right? Mm. I'll be right back. -You're gonna get it? -I got it. You- you can wait. I-- I'll totally get it for ya. -No. I've got it. -All right. That's my girl. [glass breaking] Hey! Hey! Thomas! Thomas! [grunting] Wha-? He, he took my purse! Call the police. Wait! Don't-- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, no, no! Stop! Give me the fuckin' purse. [grunting] Hey! -Hey, are you okay? Hey! -Yeah, yeah. It's okay. -It's okay. -You're bleedin', man. -I'm all right. -Are you okay? -Yeah. -You need an ambulance or somethin'? No. No, thank you. We-- we-- we got it. We got it. Baby! I got it! [siren wailing] Jen! L.A.P.D. Hey, Officer. Thank you. Uh, false alarm. I'm-- I'm fine. We got a forty-seven, possible two-seven-three-D. I'm fine. Uh, we got the guy. It, uh, it was the purse. We got the purse. -Not pressing charges. -You got some I.D., sir? I do. I do. Right back there. I'll-- I can explain. There was a guy. He--he took th--the purse. Okay, why don't you just take it easy and show me some I.D. No, no, no. You don't understand. I have to go to the hospital right now. I-- Look, I'm a lawyer. I know my rights. I-- I have to go. This is my home, all right? I have to go. -All right. All right. Back it up. -I'm having a baby, right now. -My wife's having a baby right now. -Sit down and calm down. We can do this the easy way, sir, or we can do it the hard way. -You tell me. -Okay, let's make it easy. Let's make it real easy. I.D.? -[Jen pushing and panting] -[midwife] One more! Oh. -Is everything okay? -Yeah, yeah. Wa-- wa-- wait. -Where is she? Where's she at? -What happened to your face? -Is baby okay? -Yeah, yeah. No, she's fine. Baby's healthy. All right? Calm down. Everything is well. Look, um, you just missed Bill and Kate. -They left. -Where is she? Over there. -First room? -Yeah, the first room on your right. Tom, wait, wait. -Thank you. -Yeah. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. Are you okay? I-- I'm fine, I'm fine. -I told you not to go, but... -I'm fine. I'm fine. Uh, Liam? -He's okay. -[laughing] -Oh, my God. Um... -They're gonna bring him by in a second. I'm so sorry. -I can't believe I'm so-- -Hey, it's okay. No, it's not. I-- I-- I wasn't here, and I-- I-- I missed it. [Jen chuckling] What? Are, are you sure you're okay? Is-- is, its...? I'm okay, honey. I'm okay. Liam is okay. But there's something I need to tell you. What? He's... -What? -[nurse] Here's Mommy! Uh... Um, I don't... uh, I don't think this one's ours, right? Because... Tom... He's adorable. But he's probably, I think maybe the... Is it another room that he might have been... [Jen] No, Tom. He's ours. He's ours. Oh, no, no. Uh, just look. See. He can't... Um. Wha-- uh. I want to see my boy. Where's, where's Liam? Tom, that is Liam. That's the baby they took out of me. That's, that's the one that... [sighing] He's ours. He's our little Liam. Tom. Tom. He's your son. [Liam crying] It's so hard to just let him sleep, you know? Tom. He can only be yours, you know? I need you to know that. Do you understand what I'm saying? I need you to understand that he's yours. Yes. Yeah. Do you remember our first date? You don't count Runyon Canyon. You're the only one who counts Runyon Canyon. I mean our first official date. Do you remember what you told me? That you were beautiful? [sighing] I don't know, I told you a lot of stuff. Um, about my dad. Yeah, that-- that was a lot. I fell in love with you that day. I wish he could be here, Tom. Your grandparents, too. I'm saying, Tom, I'm saying that I know that the only family you have is the one that we're starting right now. And I know that it may not look exactly like-- like you pictured. But it is your family. But I want you to be sure, so, um... 'Kay. But [chuckling], what? Test. If you want one, I'll get one. Like a, like a paternity test, like, to prove... Yeah, the doctor said he could give us one, so. I mean, I don't understand the genetics behind this. But I mean, I think it's rare, and, um, one of us might... Like one of us could have a black ancestor. -Or like a recessive gene or, or-- right? -Yeah. Yeah... Exactly. I mean, it's crazy, right? It's crazy. I just don't... I don't know, I don't, I... How well do you really know your mom's side of the family? I know my mom, knew my mom well enough to know that she-- It's, uh, it's hard to imagine. Yeah. When my dad got sick and my mom just left, I didn't think I'd trust another woman ever again. And I didn't. I don't go to church. You are my faith, and if I can't believe you, I can't believe anything. So, I don't need a test. I know he's ours. 'Kay. He's just a... -He's a miracle, right? -[laughing] Yeah. [crying] [photographer] Ah! You're killin' me, man! [laughing] Sir. Yes? Ah, the picture. What picture? Megan's all over me to get a picture of the baby, and I'm trying to get all over Megan, so if you could help me out. Oh! Yeah, I know. I forgot. -Cool. -Yeah. I'm startin' to think this baby doesn't exist. It's just like a sympathy-- ploy or somethin'. Do we really need a picture for that? I mean, can't we just do the whole proud-to-announce-eight-and-a-ha lf pounds deal? -Yes, of course. -Good. -With a picture, so I can go out with Megan. -What? Look, if you want, I can make it easy, and I can track down that announcement Ted Dinsmore sent everyone, uh, use it as a template, you know. Obviously without the DePaul Blue Demons theme 'cause, uh, we all know that Megan will go out with me if I just chip away. -Not your problem. -[Jen] How are you? Yeah, hey. Uh, will you send me an email with--with the baby picture? - Sure, yeah, I can do that. -[Alex] Albright on line two. -I-- I gotta go. - How're ya doing? -I love you. - Love you, too. Hello, Jim! Uh, your jumper's lookin' better, man. I still don't know how a black man in America makes it to his thirties without touching a basketball. I just don't get that. Gettin' your head in the books, man. Academic scholarship. You should know about that. And you see this shit right here? I just use this as a leisure pastime, like skiing, like golfing. Like lawn bowling, you know? Oh, God, please. Just never talk like that on the basketball court again, please. Just for me, for your safety. Don't... Uh, speakin' of leisure, right? Are you goin' to this party, uh, Mike's thing? Yeah, nah. I don't think we can afford to miss that. Fuck! Give me the fuckin' ball. Uh, I think I'm fuckin' up the Albright case, man. Talk to me. There's a senior creditor with a legit judgment. -What! -Yeah. -How much? -You don't wanna know, man. -It's a lot. -No! T-- T-- Tom! How much? It's two-point-eight. Million? Oh, my fuckin' God! It's a cluster-fuck, Ron. I-- I don't know, what to do. I-- I-- I can't find a way around. Not on this one. I can't. All right. You know what? Um, I think I can work it. Yeah, I'm pretty deep into this. And this is somethin' that I think that you and I sure can't afford to fail, all right? And we shoulda been had this in a while ago. -That's what I'm sayin'. -Yeah. -All right? -Play me one-on-one. One game, come on. -Naw. -Okay, you check out. You-- you get ball. -You get ball. Check the ball. -Man. I'm cool, man. Look, you--you're too aggro, you're too aggro for me right now. -I'm just gettin' warmed up. -I'm not trying to fuck with that shit, man. -Look, man. You gotta get your head on straight. -To seven. -Let's go. -No! -Let's go! Check the ball, Ron. -Okay? No. I'll see you at the party! -Give me--just play to, like, three! Will you- -No! -See ya at the party, buddy. -Come on, Ron! [general chatter] -[Jen] Hi! -]woman] Hi! You look great. [Jen] Thank you. You, too. It's good to see you. [woman] It's good to see you, too. Hi love. Thank you for doin' this. Of course! No, I know it's our first time leavin' him. I just, I gotta make an appearance. Let 'em know I'm not gonna be slacking. Yeah, I know I have to be here. And I'm here. -Let's do this! -Let's do it. 'Kay. Oh, my God. He's relentless. [laughing] -Some wine? Okay. -Yeah. [gasping] Oh, my God. He's so cute. That is so big of you guys to adopt. I mean, I really think more people should be adopting. I mean, truly, such a generous act from you guys. Uh, no, no. He's--he's ours. Like, um, Tom and I are his biological parents. Um, apparently there's been a recessive gene floating around in one of our families. [laughing] Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. -I didn't mean to say... -No-- no-- no, it's okay. I think we're getting used to people's confusion. [woman] That's so weird. -I've never heard of such a thing. -Yeah, it's very surprising. It's rare, but it happens more often that you... You know, I read a statistic the other day about the number of babies that get switched in the hospital, and it's alarmingly high. I was shocked! It's something like seven percent. I'm gonna go get us somethin' to drink. -Yeah, I need somethin'. -Thank you. All right. I got you. [sighing] I can play, like, any ethnicity. [laughing] I'm German, French, English, Irish, Cherokee and African American. -Yeah! -Excuse me, guys. I'm Cherokee. -Really? -Well, I really, I never would have had any idea. [woman] Oh, my God... If I have to explain my child to one more white woman who thinks that she's entitled to reparations because she's one-sixteenth Cherokee, I'm gonna fuckin' lose my shit. Yeah, so you give them your DNA and they do all the tracing for you. -Hm. -And apparently, apparently every person in the world, in the world, can be traced back to a single source in Africa. [chucking] Africa. -You have a beautiful family. -No. Oh, no-- no-- no. -Um, I'm actually--- -His father's right over there. Wait, what? My friend Eva just got the most beautiful baby girl from Malawi. Where's yours from? My uterus. -[chuckling] -Uh, babe? -Yeah! -Can we talk a second? Yeah. People are unbelievable. I mean, I'm just gonna stop showing the pictures. No. You can't do that. You can't let other people's ignorance stop us from celebrating our son. I'm sorry, but it's not my responsibility to teach a racial-genetics seminar. I'm not saying it's your-- Wait, what did they say? Did some--? If anybody says anything to you you don't like about our kid, you tell me. No. It's fine. It's fine! It's fine. Can we just go? I have to stay. There's some people Mike needs me to meet, and I-- I have to stay. It's gonna be weird if you leave now. Could ya just-- maybe another hour. Another hour? Yeah, I think that it will be okay if you leave. People should understand that because you have a fucking newborn. I know that, Jen. I just, I need them to see how dedicated I am. I have to- Hey! All right, you know what, guys? It's getting late. I gotta go. I wanna wake up in the morning for work. Got a lot to do and so do you. All right? So, you get some sleep, all right, Jen? All right. You know what? Actually, can you walk me to my car? -Absolutely. -I think I'm gonna go. -Well, uh, I'll see you at home. -Okay. See ya there. All right. -Get some rest. -You too. T--Money! Hey, Graham. How are ya? You know, it's funny. I've met Jen like nine, ten times. I had no idea she was black. Is that weird? I mean it makes total sense now when I look at her. But it's like, whoa, okay. I think it's cool, though, man. Interracial girls are so fucking beautiful, right? Obviously, I'm preaching to the choir here. I don't know, is that-- Like is it weird for you to have, like, a baby that doesn't look -anything like you? -Yeah, I-- I got a-- a lotta... Yeah! Totally. Okay, um, also, uh, some of the paralegals were, like, starting to gossip and stuff. And I just want you to know I put a stop to it. So. I think when they saw the firmwide, they kinda freaked out. I think some people just need help, like, catchin' up with the times or whatever. But, um, anyway, I'm happy for you, dude. Uh, I'll see ya. Ron, you gotta be kidding me! I'm just-- will you please get on that call for me? -I can't! -[Ron] All right, I'll try, Tom. I'll try. I-- I'm tellin' you... Did you see his email? I--I never got an email from him. - I gotta go. -Wait-- Ronald, let me know, uh, about, about that. [Mike] Tom, you're supposed to be my point man! - I'm still waiting on last week's order of evidence. -[Tom] Yes, sir...absolutely. [call ending] God, I'm-- I'm so sorry I couldn't be in there with ya. I just, I had to take that-- that call. I just, I couldn't... [sighing] -It's okay. -[Liam crying] But he agrees with the midwife? He's doin' good? Yeah, that's what the doctor says. Did he happen to say anything more about, uh--- -[cell phone ringing] -God damn it! Fuck. Please try not to curse around him. You serious? I thought he wasn't pickin' anything up yet, ya know? Try to get my fill in while I still can, ya know? Sorry. You-- you're right. Totally. Shouldn't be cursin' around him. Uh, you're doin' it. Yeah, I've given up trying to give it up. It's part of me. Hey. Hey. Why is your wife not returnin' my calls? What? I got a gift for the little guy, and I wanted to come by and give it to him. Damn, you look good. -What are those, new cuff links? -No. You know, sometimes I think I look good. I come to work, I see you, I think why'd I even try. [laughing] You'll never learn, I guess. You do know that it's casual Friday, right? Well, if I tried getting into this building dressed just casual, I'd be mistaken for the mailroom guy, the courier, or something. Okay, is that just something you think? Or has that actually happened? I don't give them a chance. That's the point. There are two black guys in this building, and one of them is emptying wastebaskets. What? Nothing. What's the edge about? What edge? What? Tom, I've known you for ten years. [sighing] Okay, uh. Well, I'm on, like, an hour of sleep, Ron. And, and Albright is--is all over me. Uh, uh, and Graham is congratulating me for-- for banging a black woman. Wh--what? The idea, I guess, is that Jen must be black because I am, just, super white. -Oh. -Yeah. Right. Um, no, Ron, the-- the-- the main thing though is just, uh, at home, it's-- it's, um, it's... It's an adjustment. Take it easy on yourself. Go easy on Jen. Okay, and look, if anyone can handle it, the two of you can. And look, Graham? That's just Graham being Graham, all right? Fuck him. [chuckling] I need your note on the Albright case? Gotta get that to New York. You got it. All right. [Tom] My man. ♪ Got to be good I can see my baby when I leave ♪ [Jen] Babe, what are you singing? It's Pearl Jam. You know that. You know that song is about a car crash and someone dying, right? I like it. It has the word "baby" in it, a lot. Uh, if you think he's just into hip hop, that's kinda racist. [chuckling] Here. Let's go, let's go. Let's go. -[Tom] It's okay, it's okay. -[Jen] I can take him. -No, hey, listen. I wanted to... -Uh, no. It's okay. Thanks again for--for getting Kate to babysit. -That was... -Oh, that's okay. You know how excited she is about being a grandma. -Yeah. -Yeah. That's better. That's better, huh? Mm-hm. Uh... Oh. It's okay. It's okay. Hey. -It's time for bed. -Uh, I-- I can take care of him. -I-- I can't sleep anyways. -No, me neither. Well, then, maybe you and I could have some time, just the two of us, without the little guy, and maybe think about making another little guy. [exhales] Um, Tom, [clearing her throat] you know I'm pretty sore, right? Uh, yeah. Think it could be a couple weeks. You're right. We should probably just fool around or something. Tom, I feel really gross. You know? I'm just not, I don't... -It's fine. No, I'm sorry. It's fine. -Okay. Hey, just-- just give me a kiss. That's all I need. No, I'm just saying that he was the one who wanted to meet for lunch, so he could've texted. Well, he's point person on the biggest case the firm's had in years. You're lucky he comes home at night. Don't make excuses for him. [man] And as you should know... What's up, bro? How ya doin'? I'm really good. -Hey, how's it goin', Tiffany? -Oh, it's Jen. Have a good lunch. You, too. Uh, great seeing you. What the hell did she just say? I don't know. Can't imagine why you, uh, dumped her! Oh, it was, it was the other way around. -What? Tom said it was you. -Yeah, that's what I told Tom. -What? -Oh, I just... I think you can do better. Yeah, I mean, you always say that, but whenever I... I mean, do you wanna settle down? Like, you've been more involved with... I don't know. I just don't get it. Look. I'm tryin', Jen. Okay, but most women out here are not as glamorous as you. I mean, you set the bar kinda high. Seriously. Stop. [laughing] [hip hop music playing on radio] Three chicken tacos, hold the onions. One cheese quesadilla with guac on the side. And two waters, please. -[Liam crying] -[Jen] Hey. -You want something to drink? -[man] You, by the way, you guys have a beautiful family. -Oh... -Thank you. Thank you. Kinda weird, right? I mean, is that something that you gotta constantly think of, um- Come here, little boy. -Oh! -Ooh. Is that something that you're gonna think of, um, somebody's always talkin' about, and makes you think that... Yeah, oh, well, fuck 'em, ya know? -Yeah. -Right? You know what? On that note, are you gonna tell me what it's like bein' a mom? What's goin' on? -Is it that obvious? -Hey, big boy. Uh, hi. Hm? I mean, I just-- I don't know if we can raise a kid, period? But I really don't know if we can raise a black kid. Why not? Because it's different. How? [man] Order up. I wanted to talk. I didn't want to get cross-examined. I'm... Are you just waiting for me to say something racist? Look, I'm sorry. No, I just, I can't-- I'm having a really hard time talking to Tom about this. And I, um, and I don't really know how to start with my parents, so I've just been... You can talk to me. You can talk to me. [man] Order up. -Okay? -Oh, sorry. Got some Cheeto. Hm. "Stuck at work. So sorry." -I-- I can't believe him. -[man] Order up. -I'm gonna take this to go, okay? -Yeah. -Here you go. -Thanks. Hey. -All right. -It's okay. It's all right. Okay. Here... Ron... You need some help? Look, um, I bought a gift for Liam. Can I bring it by tonight? Course. I'll be around. See ya. Hey. How's-- how's this? Uh, the cases they rely on are hardly dispositive. Just gotta check out the, uh, ninety-four Ninth Circuit case with, uh... Marcalough-- Marcalough Equity Partners. Oh. [sighing] What? I like you, Tom. [clearing his throat] I've always liked you. And, um, it's kinda why this is difficult for me. Um, I saw something, and you know, I don't even know if I should come to you with this, or if I should just keep this to myself. It's not really my business. But then I was thinking, you know, if the shoe was on the other foot, -what would I want you to do? Right? -Mm-hm. Because I believe in The Golden Rule, you know, "Do unto others as you would have them do..." -I know what The Golden Rule is. -Right. You know what The Golden Rule is. Okay. Um... This makes me sick. I'm sick for you, Tom, right now. I'm just-- I don't wanna say this. What is it, Graham? [sighing] -I was at lunch, and I saw your wife and Ron, and... -I know. Yeah, well, I know that they went to lunch together. I was going to meet them and I got stuck here. -So, it's, it's really... -Yeah, uh, I don't think so. -Man, they were, uh, they were... -They were what, Graham? He was holding her hand. But it was the way he was holding her hand. And then they kissed. On the mouth. Why don't you mind your own fuckin' business and get back to work? [laughing] Oh, yeah. Ah. What up, Big Daddy? Big Daddy. You never called me that once before Liam came along. Where's Jen? Outside on the deck. Ah. That one of your lady friends? Oh, you know me all too well. Yes, I do. What I love is how, you know, you like 'em all shapes and sizes, colors. Yeah. No, you know what? I'm good. I'm-- I'm actually goin' somewhere. No, no, no. You-- you gotta have a beer with me, man. A man always has time for a cold one with his best friend, right? That's the American dream. You come home from work after a long hard day, to your wife and kid. And, your best friend. -Take it. Go ahead. -C'mon. Oh, no, no, no. No! Come on, calm down! Hey, Tom! You just in the neighborhood, stoppin' by? How was lunch today? Uh, lunch was fine. Jen invited me over so, after work, so I could drop off the gift. -Hm. -I think you'll approve. I'm sure I will. I'm sure I will. God! Black kid. Huh! I got a black son, Ron. Me! I did not see that one comin', Ron. No, I don't think anyone did. No, [laughing] I don't think anyone did. Hey, you know what, man? I never really thanked you. You know, for-- for-- for takin' over. You know, when Jen had the baby, [sighing] you see, it meant a lot to me, brother. I gotta ask you somethin', man. Jen, she-- she offered to give me a test, like a, you know, like a paternity test? To prove that I am the father. You think I should do that? You're a grown man. -Do whatever the hell you want. -Oh, no. You gotta give me some advice, man. I need some advice. I need some help. Tell me what to do. Slow down, Thomas. That right there, that is my itinerary for the Frankfurt trip. Do you remember that trip? Hm? No, you probably don't. Uh, you didn't go on that trip. I went, and you-- you stayed here. It was about, uh, nine months ago. Is there something you want to say to me, Tom? I'm gonna ask you the same thing. Okay! Okay. I'll talk to you later, Mom. Love ya. Bye. What's going on? Where ya goin', man? You're not going to finish your beer? Don't ya want to say goodbye to Jennif-- Don't you want to say good bye to my wife? What the fuck was Ron doin' here? What? I said, what the fuck was Ron doing here? He was bringing a present for our child. Our child, right. You know, I think, um, I think maybe I do want that test. Can you blame me? Well, you said that you believed me, that you knew that he was yours. Hm. Well, I guess I wasn't as strong as I thought I was. And you can stop. You were never really gonna give me the test, right? I mean, I'm-- I'm just, I'm just calling your bluff. This isn't a poker game, Tom. This is a child who needs a father. Well, a man needs to know. Yeah, a man does, doesn't he? -This is not fair. This... -No, it's not. I don't want a black kid. Then you don't have one. [Jen] Yeah. It's better. Mm-hm. What are we gonna do with Tom? What are we gonna do with him? Tom, come in. What are you doing here? I asked him to come. Why? Well, we need to talk. [scoffing] I have something to say, and everybody needs to sit down! What is it, Mom? There's one little fact that was never really important, and it still really isn't. But I think it might help. And so, Jen, Bill is your father in every single way except... Uh, Katie! -We don't need to talk. Don't make this harder than it is! -Yes, absolutely. -We need to talk. -No! What is going on? Bill is not your biological father. How dare you? [sighing] What are you talking about? Um, could I have a word with you, please? -[Kate] Don't make this harder than it is! -You don't have to do this. Shut, up, Tom! Let her talk! There was a man named Rogers Parker, and the only reason that any of this is important is because he just happens to have been a black man. And he died before you were born. And I didn't want to bring you into the world without a father. And I never cheated on your father, Bill. I love you, Bill. And he never asked any questions, and he never looked back, and he loves you more than anything. But Rogers, but you are Rogers' daughter. Dad, did you know? No. No! I did not know he was black. So you knew that you weren't my biological father? So how come I'm not black? Technically speaking, that makes you half African American. No, I'm not. Why are you saying this? So you knew where he came from. I know where he came from. -He came from his father. -[Bill] Jeni... His father's sitting right there. That's all I need to know. You have every reason to be upset. Just... My dad's not my dad, and I'm black. Is there anything else? Can we just discuss this as a family? And what do you expect me to say? [chuckling] I'm leaving. I'm going, we're going home. Jeni, Jeni, Jeni. Don't come home. What was his name? Rogers Parker. -Rogers, with an "s". -Yes. How did he die? An accident. Do you know his family? Where's he from? Los Angeles. I'm very worried about my daughter right now. Me, too. [door opening] [door closing] Katie. Katie! You had no right to do that. -Absolutely no right. -You think it's selfish? You think I wanted to tell them, or you, or anyone? No! I think you wanted to keep it a secret. -From me, and from everyone! -You're damn right I wanted to keep it a secret. I was protecting my daughter! But he wasn't a black guy. That's not what you said. You said he was a guy you met at school, that he- he was trying to start a business. He was starting a business, and he was black. So if Jennifer had been born black, that's how you would have told me he was a black guy? Well, then you would've known, wouldn't you? I slept with a black man. I loved him. If you had known, you would've run for the hills. -It doesn't make any difference. But to you, it does. -What? How do you know this? It's m-- Nice, nice. It's my fault now? It's my-- I-- I--I-- because I'm, what, some kind of racist? Tell me I'm wrong. Tell me you wouldn't have left. If you want to stay on the couch, you can stay there. Exclusively. And do not talk to me unless I talk to you first. [knocking] I just IM'ed you those addresses in southwest LA you requested? Is this like a pro bono thing or...? Yeah. Well, thank you. Thank you, Alex. [soft knocking on door] I just need to get some clothes, okay? I was wrong, and I am sorry, but you have to... Don't! I can only imagine how curious you must be about this man. What man? You... y-- your father. Bill is my father, in every way that matters. He loved me. He raised me. He is my dad. And Mom will tell me about Mr. Rogers if I wanna know about him. Mr. Parker. His name was Rogers Parker. I know! You know, I don't feel much different now that I'm black. Do you feel different that-- now that you know I'm black? I mean, how could you ask me that? Well, I figure, you know, you didn't want a black kid, so having a black wife probably isn't necessarily very high on your list, either. Okay, that was a terrible thing that I said. I said I was gonna be the best dad ever, and you said you were gonna be the best mom. And as soon as you let me back on this team, that is exactly what we are gonna be. Tom, I didn't say I was gonna be the best mother. You said that. I didn't become a mother so that I could be the best. I became a mother because you wanted a family, and I love you that much. Okay, so-- so it's-- I forced you into having a kid. Is that...? [sighing] C-- Can we just stop pretending for a second that I'm the only one that has any kind of problem with the fact that our-- our kid looks nothing like either one of us? I don't have a problem with it! [Liam crying] I have a problem with the fact that my husband thinks that I fucked his best friend. That my husband doesn't want our own kid. I have a problem with the fact that the first time any kind of challenge comes up in our family, you're ready to bail. That is my problem, Tom. I don't trust you. [crying] I still want to. I still want to. [Tom crying] I'm so sorry. You can. You can. You can trust me. -You can trust me. -It's okay. You can trust me. -Oh, man. -It's okay, Tom. He, uh, he-- he has a sister in Baldwin Hills. Who? Rogers. He-- he has a sister, right here in L.A., and-- and I found her. We can meet her. Why? Why? Because we should know about, you know, about our--our--our son's grandfather. And, you know, he-- he should. And--and we should, I mean, we need to know. How long have you had to find out something, anything about your own mother? Why don't you try starting there, instead of coming at me about something that I've known about for two fucking days? Okay, this is not... He already has a grandfather, and I already have a father. Right. And I'm not asking you to give him up. I'm just saying... My mom's been dead to me for a very long time, and you know that. We have more family, and they're alive, and they're right here. You just want to get the facts so you can corroborate Mom's story. What? My God, this is not-- That's not true. -Thomas. -That-- that's not it. That's not it. [Jen sighing] -You can't even admit it to yourself. -Stop. Just... I know you better than you do. You are your own worst enemy. [scoffing] All we know about this guy, this-- this man, is that he was black, right? Don't-- don't you wanna define him any more than that? I need to define us. And I thought I already had. Ready to have a day with Daddy? -What are you doing? -I'm going to work. -Right, you work at home. What...? -I'm gonna go see a client. -Well. -[Liam crying] -But what about Liam? -Oh, I'm glad you asked. Since he's your kid again now, why don't you take care of him? -Wha-- where do you do that in Los Angeles? -[Megan] There are a few rinks. -What, are you Canadian or something? -No, I'm not Canadian. I am from Washington, though, which is pretty close. Well, it's a logical question if you go ice skating. [gasping] Oh. Well, well, nobody told me it was bring your baby to work day... Back off! Good morning, good morning. And good morning to you, Liam, you good baby. Um, Albright's already left two messages. I got a car coming at 10:30 to take you down to Anaheim, and I printed out three copies of your speech, all in a different size font, so you can pick. Anaheim conference, that's today. [laughing and squealing] You're kidding, right? Yeah. Sure. Um, why don't you come along, Alex? I will grab the company van, and, um, I emailed you a-- a new itinerary. [opening door] This isn't Anaheim. [phone vibrating] Is there a separate, secret itinerary that I didn't get? Yeah, just hang in there for me, Al. Can you just confirm that you getting fired isn't me getting fired? -Uh, do-- do we have any calls? -Yes, five. Uh, okay, okay. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Um, just... I'm sorry. I can't hear you 'cause of the... -Yeah, [yelling] Stop crying! -[Liam crying louder] [Jen] Tom? I called your office, and Megan told me that you took Liam to some conference in Anaheim? I mean, what the fuck, Tom! When I screamed at him, back then, I-- I really didn't mean to, uh... -[text alert] -[Alex] That's okay. The pressure you're under, it's understandable. This is the address. Um, [stuttering] let's-- Let's get out of here, Alex. Uh, I gotta do this with my wife, all right? Uh, we-- we gotta go home. Um, office. Back to the office. I'm sorry. [Alex] It's okay. You want some gum? -Hey, sweetheart. Can I come in? -Yeah. Um... [sighing] Dad. Don't worry. As far as I'm concerned, you're my one--and--only. I feel the same way. [clearing his throat] She told me that, uh, she thought that if I knew that, uh, the child was gonna be from a black man that I would leave. And, uh, I think I-- I-- I would have. I would have missed being your father. I would have missed the greatest thing that ever happened to me in my life. So what are you saying? I was a different guy. I-- I-- I-- it was a different time then. I-- I thought differently. How do you see me now? I see you exactly the same. My-- You're my daughter who I love. Hey, I'm sorry I yelled at you. And I guess I'm not gonna be the best dad ever. But, uh, somebody really smart once said that the best thing a father can do for his child is love the child's mother. And I love your mom so much. So much like it hurts sometimes. But it's like a good hurt. It's hard to explain. You'll probably get it someday. I'm your dad, and I'm gonna be there. -[whispering] Hi. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. -[Liam whimpering] What? What? -[Liam crying louder] -[Jen] No, it's okay. [Kate] There's no point in you seeking him out. He's gone. He was gone before you were born. But Mom, it's like I have this whole other family that I never even was given the opportunity to know about. I'm your family. And this lovely house and father I've given you. You gave me. It wasn't yours to give. And the other family isn't yours to take away. [sniffing] I didn't want to f-- you to feel like you were a stranger in your own family. I was protecting you. For being black? Yes. How can you be so naive? Tell me about my father. What do you wanna know? I don't know. Anything. He was tall. He was tall. Was that his best quality? He went to a store. I think it was a Kmart. And a man came in and tried to rob it. And Rogers stopped him, and he pinned him to the ground. And when the cops arrived, they thought he was a suspect, assaulting an innocent white man. They put him in a choke hold, he blacked out, and he never woke up. He was the farthest thing from a criminal. He'd probably still be alive if he were white. I didn't find out about it until weeks later. It was harder to get a hold of people back then. You never went to his funeral? You never contacted his family? You don't understand. It's complicated. Things were different. I didn't want you to be black, and you weren't, and that's that. [sighing lightly] You know, I did tell you about him once. I think I'd remember that. You were four. I was fucking four? [laughing] Yes. I don't remember anything from when I was four. Well, I told you when you were four, and I wanted to see how you would act. See how you'd take it. Was he wearing a tie? In this picture, you had a picture where he's smiling, and he's wearing a tie. Get it. [sobbing] Come with me. I wanna show you something. Bring Liam. [distant plane flying] [Kate] We met in a gallery. [giggling] He knew I was pregnant. He didn't care. -Oh, sh... -Oops. Do you remember this place? -The coffee shop? -Mm-hm. Do you remember what it was before when you were little? The old school place with the jukebox. You used to take me here for cheeseburgers when Dad was out of town. Yeah, I loved this place. What was it called? This was the last place I was with Rogers before he died. Thank you. Let's sit over here. [soft music playing] I was here with Rogers and his sister. You knew his sister? Over there, actually. What did he like to order here? -Cheeseburgers. -[laughing] And then he'd, um, get French fries. And he'd put them on top of the-- inside, on top of the cheeseburger with ketchup on top. [Jen laughing] -I do that sometimes. -Mm-hm. I need you to take a look at your email. I need to get that to D.C. by the end of day. -Can I talk to you for a second? -I'm busy. Jen's real father was black. His name was Rogers Parker, and he died in 1982. So that explains Liam. That's great. I lost my head. But that was inexcusable. Uh, it was stupid. What I'm tryin' to say is, I'm sorry. Yeah. I-- I have a conference call that... It was a lapse. It was a momentary loss of judgment based on-- on facts. I mean, it was not a-- a belief, right? It... I was weak, and-- and I let out creep... Well, how can you pretend that you don't know me all of a sudden, man? -How--how can you pretend...? -I saw your eyes. They were like the little old ladies in the elevator that hug their purse, the fuckin' cab drivers that don't stop for me, the department store guys that follow me around the fuckin' store. That thing in your eyes, I saw it. And right, I was in your kitchen that night. I saw it. S-- so did I. I-- I told you that I lost... that's-- that's not me. I-- I lost myself. You revealed yourself. Yeah. Well, what do you want from me, man? Nothing. Nothing. [sighing] [breathing deeply] [phone ringing] -This is Tom. - Tom, this is Mike. Meet Ron and I in the conference room. We need to discuss the Albright case. [sighing] [Mike] Tom. Have a seat. About the Albright case. As you well know, Ron has been picking up your slack, your major slack. I'm giving Ron the lead. Thank you, Ron. Thank you, Tom. That's all. [Jen] Tom, I plucked one hair from your head as he slept in my arms. It's all I needed. I got the test a week after he was born. You hold the results in your hand. I could've forgiven you for doubting. I wanted you to know. I wanted... you. I hope Ron can forgive you for thinking what you thought about him. About us. You two have always made each other better men. For me it wasn't about the choice not to get this test. It was about the choice to be a father. I can't apologize for what I made him. And I wouldn't have him any other way. I need to know you feel the same. I will stand behind him, and with him. I can't imagine anyone but you standing with me. You can apologize. You can say you want to be a family again. But I don't know if words can fix this now. And actions speak louder. So speak loudly. Or don't speak at all.
