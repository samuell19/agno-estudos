I suppose it's not her fault. Come on, old boy. [ Cecil ] I'll start with the ground floor, Shamela. You check the upstairs. - Right you are, poopsie. Is something the matter, sir ? Oh, no, no. Just checking the inventory. Who better than the one destined to inherit it all ? Absolutely. I'm beginning to think the Duke is getting carried away... With his generosity these days. The old fart should be committed. Sculpture one, painting two. Ow ! Ow ! [ grunting ] Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! Possible senility. Ow ! [ gasps ] Cecil ! Oh, what is it ? - My fa-- - Come on, spit it out.

Oh, just admiring the family jewels. -I've got no time for puffery. Hubert and I are out on a hunt. -[ Hubert barking ] - You sure you're up to it ? - Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm quite chipper. If it really comes down to it, I think I could take him. - En garde ! - Aah ! - Still upset, huh ? [ chuckling ] - [ whimpering ] - [ barks ] - [ gasps ] [ Cecil ] Are you daft ? Perhaps, but I'm... No closer to death than Ruffshire is to being yours ! It's tax time, Uncle. The inland revenue is not as forgiving as it once was. Sheer whiggery ! That's what I think of your papers ! - Uncle ! - Oh, your-- Oh, good morning. - It's a lovely morning. - Shamela, you're up early. Did you lose something ? - [ shrieking ] - [ Edward chuckling ] [ barking ] Uncle and I were just discussing the idea of tightening the belt-- Laying off some staff, raising the villagers' rents and then-- Aah ! Ow ! Come here, you rascal ! [ gagging ] Say "uncle" three times. Uncle, uncle, uncle. Uncle, you simply cannot keep on selling... Our precious masterpieces to subsidize those greedy commoners ! It's always been my opinion that it's more blessed to give than to receive. Take that old abstract. I never cared for his work anyway. That should pay the taxes for the next five years. Oh, glorious day. Just smell that fresh air. Would you like a leg up ? No, no, of course not. Ready, Hubert ? All aboard. Full steed ahead ! [ chuckles ] Bye, Charlotte. [ barking ] - Hello, Florian ! - Hello, Your Grace. Florian is helping Agnes for the summer break. It appears your drive could use some work, Your Grace. I'd be happy to assist.

It's clearly in the Duke's hand, and that is the Cavendish seal. "And appoint Charlotte Chives... "His sole guardian until he is of adult age, to be from this day forward referred to as 'Lady.'" - A Lady ? - Excuse me. I think this belongs to a Duke. [ Cecil ] This can't be. - He's a dog !

How could you possibly know ? - [ Cecil groaning ] Each Duke title must be formalized by a ball, where the Queen must approve of the Duke. But Hubert isn't ready for a social debut. Neither am I. What if the queen doesn't approve ? I'm afraid we have no choice. Hubert will not be Duke without the Queen's approval. - [ Charlotte ] But we have no cook. - I can see how that would be... [ croans ] A sticky wicket. I made up some invitations. A formal ball ? Black tie and tails ? [ groans ] [ continues groaning ] You requested an etiquette expert ? Indeed, madam. Chives. Please come in. Mrs. Puddingforth. How do you do ? My niece-- Lady Charlotte. How do you do ? A pleasure, Lady Charlotte. And the Duke ? [ clears throat ] Hubert ?

Yes, we realize, but we can't just let royalty go to the dogs, now can we ? I shan't participate in some circus ! Understandably so. However, times like this... Require extraordinary service.

I don't mean to interrupt, but I heard you're in need of a chef. - [ barks ] - [ whimpers ] How are you doing, Your Grace ? [ barks ] Do you have any formal training ? Um, I'm afraid not, sir. I do make a decent Shepherd's pie, a fair liver mush, and my mincemeat's very well received. Daisy loves my scones. - Good. What do you think, Hubert ? - [ barks ] Yes, I quite agree. You're hired.
