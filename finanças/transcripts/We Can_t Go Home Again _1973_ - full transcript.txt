[ Nicholas Ray Narrating ] I had read of a festival of life... being called in Chicago, Illinois. I remembered that in the late-19th century... a governor of Illinois had refused to allow a major political party... to hold its convention... on the grounds that such a demonstration... might incite riots and violence. Within three hours after being inside that city, I had been maced... and my camera had been smashed. This is the federal court building. On trial were men like Jerry Rubin, Rennie Davis, John Froines, Dave Dellinger, a Quaker, Abbie Hoffman, Bill Kunstler. We heard that Fred Hampton had been murdered... in one of the most shameful ambushes... ever perpetrated on any group of people in the United States. The confrontation had been too tough. Most people began to disappear. What really made me wonder was, where is everybody? [ Man ] Hey, schmuck! What made you think of growing a beard? Charlton Heston playing Moses. [ Ray Narrating ] Fortunately I was offered a job... in an upstate New York university. Hell, I decided I'd buy a crooked cane, grow a goatee, wear a crooked smile... and impress them... with my rhetoric, rebellion and ponderosity. [ Ray ] What was the first traumatic experience you recall? [ Woman ] What I remember most is the night of the Bay of Pigs. John Kennedy's eyeballs must have been hanging down to his chin. I ran to the telephone after he talked. I remember. [ Woman #2 ] I ran to the telephone to call my friends, to say good-bye to them. All of us thought the holocaust would happen before we saw morning. [ Ray ] What are you talking about? You were only eight years old. [ Woman #2 ] "Only"? My friends all called their friends. We thought we'd all be dead, so we had to say good-bye. I remember running to my father and begging him to build a bomb shelter.
