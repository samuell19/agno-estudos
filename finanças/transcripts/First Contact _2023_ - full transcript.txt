- Are we alone? - Debbie. Come on, girl. Are we just one of a kind, one paralleled rarity in a universe of nothing? Our universe has been around 70,000 times longer than we have. Come on girl, come on. Where the hell did you go? I need to focus. One false move, and uh theoretically I could turn into dark matter or I simply turn to dust. I'd rather not find out. Damn it. Debbie? - People are scared. There's been over 300 Sightings. NASA's got involved now. - I don't know if you can hear it here. There's a whirring noise and I've seen shit in the sky that does not look like any helicopter or airplane I've ever fucking seen. - We started receiving reports about three weeks ago, and NASA was able to confirm what they were seeing, which is an unidentified object coming slowly towards earth's orbit. - And if there is a UFO up there, we don't know what it is. - We see these things with or without the cameras. They're here, it's a fact. What are we doing about this? - This traveled light years to get to us, meaning that whatever we do, we're already behind the ball. - You see me and my family think that this is a sign from them, that us, the chosen ones, will soon be elevated. - Not to be that guy. I know we're all scared right now, but I am really freaking out, okay? - There's no reason to panic. We've not seen any evidence that the object is hostile. - We have things careening towards this planet. - Basically just kind of getting out of the city as soon as I can. I don't really know what the fuck's going on. I don't know what y'all motherfuckers are doing, but if you're watching this, you should probably try to get out of the city. - NASA is continuing to investigate and we will address the public with any findings we may come across as we proceed. - And whether it's the Chinese, whether it's aliens or whatever the hell it is, we need to take charge. We need to win. - Well I would caution anyone against the idea of winning and losing in this situation. I think the most important thing that we can all do is just to stay calm. There's no reason to panic. We've not seen any evidence that the object is hostile. - We have things careening towards this planet and you're telling us to just stay calm? Take a few deep breaths? Is this a yoga class? No, this is real life. We need to take some action here. We need to stand up and defend this country. Defend this planet. Take the lead here as we have always done throughout the history of this country. - You know I will always give you the truth. If I'm right, I'll tell you I'm right. If I'm wrong, I will tell you I'm wrong. I was wrong on this one, folks. It does appear that there are objects... Hey, this is Chloe. Please leave message and I'll call you back. - Hey uh, sorry I missed your call. I'm just in the middle of something. Um, can you call back, please? I wanna talk to Benny and you. Right, um, talk to you soon. - These things are coming toward the globe. At this point, what are you gonna do about it, doctor? - All right... - Hey stranger. How long you been here? - About an hour. You? - Just got in last night. - See you made yourself at home. - So things must be crazy for you right now with all the UFO alien stuff. - Probably would be if I had a job. Funding got cut off. - Damn Casey, I'm sorry. - They're more interested in focusing on weapons development, your territory. - Right. It really has been a long time. I got out like three years ago. - Oh. Well that's good, right? Hey, how's Chloe? - She uh- we split about two years ago. - Oh, sorry um, Benny? - Well, he's not here. I- he's, he's good. He just turned 10 last week. He's super smart. - When's the last time you talked to dad? - I don't remember. You? - Maybe a year. God I didn't even know he was missing. - Yeah, me neither. Just got the paper from down the road. - Yeah, I saw. - It just, made it real, you know? This house is so old it's been making noises since I got here. - It's gonna need a lot of work if anyone's gonna buy it. - So you wanna sell it? - Don't you? I mean, we could both use the money, right? - How long you planning on staying? - I don't know. The police found no trace of him? Wanna look around here. See what dad was working on, you know? - Well knock yourself out. - Okay. You wanna go find one more? - No I gotta leave early tomorrow. - What? Why? - When I get back. - Okay - Are you sure you're good to drive? - Yes, I'm fine to drive. - You sure? - Stop, I'm fine. - We can call a car you know? - Yeah, I was born to drive. Sit back and put your seatbelt on. - Oh baby. - So over the last month there's also been some seismic activity that's going on. A lot of earthquakes. A lot of people lost their homes. - Uh well Penelope, I'm not a geologist. My heart obviously goes out to those who have lost their lives and their homes- - You love it, don't you? - I do. The fuck? What happened? What is that? - I have no fucking clue. Hang on. - No, baby. - No, no, no. Just stay there. - Ugh, my phone. Goddamn it. Kevin? Kevin? Kevin. Kevin. Kevin get in the car. Kevin, get in the car. Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - What happened? - I don't know. - Or maybe I should drive. - Peacekeepers, man. You hear me? Not peacekeeper. No, no, no. Peacekeepers, with an S. Freaking' Trident IIs, man. Look around. We're in the middle of nowhere, man. You see any fucking water? No. Where the hell are you gonna hide to submarine, man? You hear me, Danny? - Yeah, I hear you. Just not my problem anymore. - Yeah, I guess, man. Anyway, how things going out there, huh? You feeling any better? - Not really. But Casey showed up today. She wants to sell the place. - Really? Well, is it worth anything? - Probably not. - Well tell her she can go eat shit then. Huh, how about that? I mean, think about that. You know, she goes MIA on you for three years and then comes back and thinks she can walk on in and tell you what to do? No, no, nah, no way. Fuck that. It doesn't work that way. - Hey. Can I come in? - Mikey, I gotta go. I'll call you back. Tell Stacey hi for me. - Is that Benny? He's so grown up. - Yeah, that's about all I see of him anymore. - What happened? - After Chloe and I got married and Benny was born, we're living on base, I got into an accident. I guess some things up here got scrambled. They discharged me early. After that things got dark. It's all still a little hazy to me, but, she split and- - Are you okay, like physically? - Fine now, I just get these mean headaches. I forget things a lot. - Sounds like dad. - Yeah, at least he could remember the things that he wanted to. Kinda like someone else I know. - That's fair. - You know, I tried calling, a lot. - Yep, I know. I uh, just got so busy. Sorry. - Busy? Look, if you wanna sell the house, I'm not gonna try and stop you. But you know, I-I haven't had a stable living situation and this place is like an hour from Chloe and Benny could come here on the weekends and I don't know. - Maybe you're right. When I was looking through dad's things, I swear I could feel him there, his presence. He's still here in some way or another or not totally gone. If that makes any sense. Anyway I just lost my job. No money, nowhere to go. So I guess you're stuck with me, for now. - Night. - Morning. - Morning. How'd you sleep? - Shitty. - I feel that. - I think we should look for him. Dan, dad was working on something. What if he found something that he wasn't supposed to find? We can't just give up that easy. I mean, what do you think? - I think dad is exactly where he is supposed to be. - Where are you going? - Gotta run some errands. - Morning handsome. - What happened last night? - We drank way too much. Got kicked outta Maggie's Tavern. - Did I drive. - A little bit. Hey, so I'm going to my sister's today but I'll be back tomorrow, okay? - Shit. That's right. - You gonna miss me? - Yeah. - You gonna make it? - Yeah. This goddamn hangover. - Shit. Shit What do you have going on today? - I'm gonna go to Jason's. - Well, we left our tab open last night if you're going to Maggie's - Yeah. No we're not. But I can get it for you. - Thank you. - Jamie, is that you? - What? I can't hear you. Are you all right? Do you hear that? What was that? - Hm? Was that- I didn't hear you, I- - Sounded like a earthquake. - Yeah. I dropped something. - Do you remember that thing in the road last night? - You know, I'm sorry. I don't think I remember everything right now. Just my head's a little- just a really bad hangover. - Okay. Well can you make sure you still get the card from Maggie's? - The what? - Card, from Maggie's. - Yeah. Yes, I can- I can get the card from Maggie's. - Hold on, hold on. We have a quote from the NASA administrator, Frances Peterson. She says that whatever is out there, whether it be benign- - Believe this shit? - I dunno. - Attention whores trying to create some steam on the internet. Another one? - Yeah. - It's all a distraction you know. It's how it starts. You're busy looking up and they're stealing our rights down below and no one cares because they're afraid of some made up horseshit. - Maybe. - Hey Kevin, how you feeling? You were in rare form last night, you here for your card? - Yeah, thank you. - She's a treasure but she knows nothing about the military and our capabilities. Honestly saying that- - Ethan actually before you close that out, I will take one more beer please. - Little Doggy here for you. You got it. - Thank you very much. - What's that? - Thank you. - You okay, man? - Yeah I'm good, how you doing? Where the fuck are you Bradach. - Wait, did you just say Bradach? - I'm sorry it's late. Thanks for the beer. - Asshole left his card again. - Let me ask you a question. Do you know a guy named Ian Bradach? - Ian Bradach. Yeah. Old guy, cops came in looking for him. Think I read in the news he passed. Why? - Just wondering. Read about him in the paper. - Don't care about light years. They care about this year. - It could be a drone you know, from some kid in their neighborhood could be a bird. - So you're saying we don't need to be prepared? - Be prepared for what? - It could be colonizing us. It could be coming to take over our world. What are you doing to prepare us for us for this? I mean,again,we don't even know what that is out there - Where the fuck did that come from? - No, no, no. I'm just saying like our, our cones in our eyes, like they're not very strong. Like, you know, we create technology in this world so that we can really see things that we personally can't see with a naked eye. So we have, you know, radar and sonar and other technology out there to help us see things that- - Bradach. What? Where is Bradach? I dunno who the hell Bradach is, man. Bradach. Where is Bradach? I don't Know. Stay out of my head man. Stop. I'm a nice guy, just- - Looks like something exploded in here. - Look at this stuff. Dad must have been working on something huge. - Yeah, it's kinda spooky. - That's why I have the trident. - That's a pitch fork. - Whatever. - Now you're smoking again? What's wrong with you? So I was looking over dad's notes. I came out here, hacked into his computer and I found a whole bunch of video diaries, all about what he was doing. - Oh, you hacked in. - I guessed the password. - And what was it? - My birthday. - Right. - Dan, I think that this could have something to do with everything else going on. The UFO's, all of it. - That's great. Have fun with that. - Hey there you reached Kevin. Uh please leave a message after the beep and I'll get back to you. - Hey Kevin it's Jason. What the hell? Was to meet you at six. All right I'm coming over. Actually, I'm already here. See you in a second asshole. Kev-O, Kevin. All right I'm coming in. Don't shoot me. Kev? Yoh! Oh, you watching TV. Okay. Missed me for TV, huh? Better be something good. I heard that Pam's got a great special offer on pelicans right now. Swear to God. Why you by yourself? Kev? Kev. - I was watching. - Oh shit. Thought you were dead man. What happened to you? - That's a funny question. Hilarious actually. All the things around us that we don't know, that we don't see. Makes me laugh. - Kevin? Kevin? You don't look so good. You- Gotta get you to a hospital, okay? - It's not important. It's the beginning of the end. You know that, right? - Kev I don't know what you're on but you gotta snap out of it, okay? - And you are? - Seriously? It's me. It's Jason. - Jason. There is a human, Bradach. I must find this man. - Let me get you some water, okay. Kev, Kevin. Breaking my arm, Kev. Kevin. - So you don't know him? - I don't know what the hell you're talking about. Oh, jeez. Fuck. Kevin, Kevin, please. - The fuck did you do? - It was necessary. - No it was not necessary. It was not necessary. Get out of my fucking head man. Hey, this is Chloe. Please leave message and I'll call you back. - Hey, just hoping to catch you before you guys went to bed. I guess I missed you. Gimme a call back please. - The date today is April 11th, 2022. It was a modest step forward today. For the first time I believe I was able to formally measure the actual gravitational abnormalities that I've been noticing. The center of which is approximately 1.2 kilometers north of the house where the law of universal gravitation simply- Well, it just doesn't work. What does work however, is what I'm tentatively calling Bradach's law of dark matter. - Hey you hear that humming? - Yeah. You might wanna see this. - I gotta go look. - Hold on, hold on. - What? - I'm coming with. Please tell we're not about to see an alien. - I dunno. - What are you doing? - Getting a closer look. - Casey, get back in the car. Casey. Casey. - Dan, Dan. Dan. Hey, you're up. - What happened? - Good question. How's your head? - Not great. - So I'm still trying to figure out what dad was doing out there. I found this machine. - Hey Casey. We gotta stop, okay. - Dan it's dad's work. - Right. It's his work and he's gone. We've gotta move on. - I'm glad you're okay. - After recording it for the past 12 months. I've discovered that amazingly there is a pattern, almost like Morse code. And despite my desire to stay grounded, the thought of communicating with other worlds does cross my mind. I dunno. Maybe this is something else. We'll see. Hey this is Chloe. Please leave a message. - Hey. You all right? - Yeah. - I'm gonna reheat some pizza. You want some? - No, I'm good. Thank you. - Kevin. What happened in there? - What happened here? This world is so goddamn hot. - Are you okay? - Do you know this man? - Well, I- who? I don't know what you're talking about. - I said do you know this man? - Oh my God. Kevin what happened to you. - Jamie. Find this man. - I dunno what you're- Kevin, we have to get you outta here right now. - Jamie? - Yeah? - So much has happened that you don't know. - You need a doctor. - It's too late for that. Doesn't matter. - Kevin. I love you. Okay. Just- just let me help you. - You can help me by finding this man. - I, I think, I think that he might, might be dead. - No. - Kevin, I don't know what you're saying. Are you saying he's still alive? I, I don't- - It is crucial that you find this man for me. - Okay. If you really think that he can help you, I will. - Great? - Find him. - Decipher the signals and follow the instructions quite thoroughly, will all this amount to anything? Will we make first contact? We must and they must be met with peace. This file. This virus. I hope guarantees that. My colleague Dr. Henry Lyman and I spoke at length about the great filter and its imminent arrival. My biggest regret... ...is if I am in any way responsible. - Daniel, Daniel - Case, is that you? Casey. - Daniel. - Hey, Hey. - Daniel. - Daniel. - Case, is that you? Casey. - Casey, wake up, wake up Casey. Hey. Hey, Hey. Wake up, wake up Casey. - Daniel. Daniel. - What are you doing? Dan? Give me the knife? Are you okay? - Yeah. - I think you were sleepwalking. I know they say never to wake someone up during their- - Casey, stop. Stop for a second. - So first the symbol on the porch, which you're saying that you did. Then the one on the table which I saw you doing? - I don't remember doing that. - Is there anything that could have caused you to- - Casey. I felt him there. Dad, his presence. Just like you said before that he was in the house. Did you find anything in the barn that could have- Okay. That's it? A thumb drive? - Let's plug it in. - What's that? - Virtual basic file could be anything. - Wait, stop. Dad was clearly hiding this. Probably for a reason. Maybe we should be a little more careful. - You're right. Sorry. - I have now been receiving, deciphering and following said instructions for over a year. Today I, I believe I have gone too far. The- the device, the dark matter receptor seemed to have briefly opened some sort of, well, some sort of portal to another world, wh- wh- whether it's a parallel dimension, extraterrestrial or something else. I do not know. I- I- I've been feeling tired and not quite as lucid as I would like. My sense of time has become chaotic at best. Worst of all, Debbie is missing. I think that's something or some things, beings came through into our world. There's something. Something evil here. - Hey. - Hey, I need to run out for a little bit. I'll be back later, but do me a favor. I found some stuff. Weird stuff. Just be careful in the house, okay? - Yeah, okay. - Great. I'll see you later. - Casey Bradach? - Hi. Yeah. Dr. Lyman. - Your father was my closest mentor. So sorry to hear what happened to him. Thank you for meeting me on such short notice. We have plenty to discuss. - Um, anybody home? Oh, hello sir. - Bradach. - Do you have any idea what happened to him? I mean, did he mention anything? - No. No. Unfortunately we hadn't spoken for years. Well, the reason I asked to meet you, I wanted to discuss the symbols in your email. - Um, I can't quite see you there. - I know, I'm not a big fan of the damn sun. Are you Bradach? - Um no, sorry. My name's Davis Mason. I'm here to talk about Jesus Christ your Lord and Savior. - Have you ever heard of the Kola Superdeep Borehole? It's a Soviet drilling project, the Kola Peninsula some 50 years back. The goal was to dig deeper than had ever been dug before, but the locals, they called it the "Well to Hell". Cause of all the screams rising to the surface. You know the stuff of urban legend. - As you know, the end is near. The beam from the sky on this side of the rapture. The book of Revelation suggests- - What do you know about the end? - Well, I know if you seek salvation, we can help you. - They get five miles down and they discover dozens of 2 billion year old fossils. Most of these are single celled organisms, the beginnings of life on earth. However, the rumor is when they got a little deeper, they found more. Now these photos have been mostly discredited, but they got leaked and examined by some of the more eccentric members of the scientific community. - Salvation? No. - Sir, if you just gimme a moment of your time- - My father referenced you in the great filter. Why? - There's an expiration date for every civilization, anywhere in the universe. It's my opinion that it's the only explanation for why we haven't made first contact yet. Your father did not quite agree. - You are right. The end is near. - Do you know how long the universe has been around for? 14 billion years. And earth? Do you know how long earth has existed? - 4.5 billion. - Correct? And humans- How long have we been around. - 200,000 Years. - And look at all we've accomplished in that time. Industrialization, space travel, and we are barely more than a tiny spec on our planet's history. We don't even know if we're the first civilization here on earth. - Your extinction is imminent. - So when you look at all we've accomplished in such little time, how could it be possible that any civilization from anywhere in the universe, haven't made first contact yet? - It's nothing to be scared of. - Because they've all come to an end. - It's just the course. - Now, your father, he thought there was something we weren't seeing. Couldn't see. - Dark matter? - What else do you know about the end Davis? - He thought if we could see it, follow it, it would open a door to understanding parts of the universe we'd never even seen. Communicate with life forms across vacuums of space and time that had never been seriously contemplated before. - A- actually sir, I- I- I should be going. - Why? I can't let you go. - He believed that first contact was the only way to stop our own extinction date. - Sir, I- I- - So what happened to him? - That Miss Bradach is an answer I unfortunately do not have. - One last thing. Do you know who Debbie was? - Debbie. Debbie was your father's dog and he loved her very much. - So I think that dad wanted to use the virus in the thumb drive to make sure that we made first contact with the aliens. - Do we know that he was like all there? - Seriously? - Yeah. Seriously. You don't understand. After the accident, I wasn't well. You know, one trigger and I would spiral for days. Now, what if it wasn't just the accident? What if it was something genetic? You know, now our dead dad and this virus is trying to kill us all. - No, look, I- I met this guy today. He was a friend of dad's. He said that the symbols you did- - Casey stop. Please just stop. He's gone, okay? He is gone. - He's our dad. - No, he was your dad. Hardly mine. And you're one to talk. The amount of times that I tried calling you to tell you what was going on or just to see how my sister was doing. You're just like him. You can't step away for one second to see what is right in front of you. - I said I was sorry. - Casey. It doesn't matter. I barely knew him. And he barely knew me. All I want is to make sure I don't make the same fucking mistake with my son. - So do you want me to go in there with you or- - No, uh, no. I just need you to close by in case anything happens. - Copy that. - If you saw him, you would know why you're here. - Are you sure you don't want me to go in there with you? - No, I need to hear him out. - Refuse to accept that this is the end. Tonight bring this on us. I don't know. The clock has been set. If my calculations are correct, Sunday, October 23rd at 6:32 AM, they see the sign and they will come. We will survive. We will go on. - Casey? - Kevin? - Come down please. - Can we talk up here? I- I found the man you were looking for. - My skin. It hurts. The down here feels nice. - Oh my God. - Tell me. - So your- your friend lived in a farmhouse at the edge of town. He's- he's dead, but I- I have the address. - Casey. - Bradach. - Casey. - Are you Bradach? - Where's Casey? - Casey is safe. She seems to be a much more welcoming host than you. - Did you know our father? - I do. - Death is a construct. There is so much more beyond death than we can see. - Wh- I can't really see anything, babe. - Time is running out. It will be here soon. - What will be here soon? - The end. - What does that mean? Are you an alien? - No. - What are you. - Does this help? - Millions of years ago we entities, evolved past our physicals forms and stored ourselves out of time and space. - Entities? - Dark matter as you call it. - What happened Kevin? - Kevin, Kevin. - Your father, Bradach allowed us into your planet. - What do you mean, the end? - It came with us. - Back up. Shit. Back the fuck up. - It will take over. It wants our end and it will be yours. -Holy shit! Jesus Christ! - The aliens? - No. It will rise. - What are you? - How do we stop it? - I am the end. - A symbol of peace, then help will come from above. They are the only hope. - Who? Who? Casey. - Stop. Stop. - Why? - I'm sorry. - Thanks. - You don't remember anything? - I need to show you something. - Oh shit. - I think that dad opened a portal to an ancient extraterrestrial being and that whoever he was talking to or whatever was talking through me is trying to help us. - Then what the fuck is that? - Clearly the portal let something else in, something evil. You said that it told you I was a better host than you. - Yeah. - It takes over living things. That's what that is. - But who? I mean for all we know, dad was alone. - Debbie. - Who's Debbie? - In one of dad's video diaries, he said that Debbie had gone missing. Debbie was his dog. - Oh. Okay. I just, I think I saw Debbie here- What used to be Debbie in the woods earlier. - Oh. - Yeah. - Gross. There's more. - You're telling me that dad was somehow communicating with the civilization that was on earth millions of years ago, and that's what possesses me and then you, and they told him that tomorrow morning could be- - The great filter. - And that is? - Our extinction date. - We need to upload the virus, share it, stop us from attacking them. Then we need to power up the machine. That's the invitation. - Just think about it for a second. How do we know that we can even trust this thing? I mean, what if this is just aliens, tricking us into laying down and killing us all. Unfortunately Dr. Morie, we have to interrupt you. ACN has obtained exclusive footage from a town in upstate New York called Delhi. We'd like to warn our viewers that this footage is extremely graphic. - Oh, Hey guys. It's Emily Black. I'm here with Wes. - What the fuck is that? - Um, all right, so we're just taking a drive and I'm just gonna show you, look at this. - Jen, I think we should turn around. - I- No. We definitely can't turn around. I have no idea what it is. I don't know if it's a man or if it's like an animal or like- - Hello? - Is it real? Okay. Just touch it. Oh my God. Oh my God. I have to... - Oh shit. - The UFOs we noticed some three years before anybody else did. Got so focused on trying to figure out what was happening out there. Nothing else mattered. I barely slept, barely ate. Just work. And after all that these past few days have shown me that I know nothing, except that I've been a terrible sister. I care about you Dan, so much. - You know I came here looking for some sort of normalcy, some stability to get away from everything from him. - He loved you Dan, more than you know. - Last night he was there. I felt in my heart and... - Dan you got to hear his voice one last time. I think since I got here, that's all I've been looking for. - Whatever that was, whatever it is, it killed him. Dad was a lot of things, but he was not a bad scientist. - So what do you wanna do? - Fuck it. Where do we start? - First things first, we need to finish putting this together. I think he was almost done with it. - All right. We've got about three hours. - Wait for the virus, do you still have clearance? - Absolutely not. - Shit. What about Mikey? - I knew it, man. I told you. Didn't I tell you? Dude, check this out. Just yesterday I overheard Hernandez hitting on the new Sergeant. Yeah, dude wouldn't shut up. He, he was, he was bragging about some, some fucking warhead stockpile. Dude, he said tomorrow, tomorrow Danny. This is all our nuclear war, man. We all gonna die. - So you'll help? - Fuck yeah I'll help. You kidding? Let's go. - Jesus. - All right, come on. - Wait, no. I gotta finish wiring it. - You'll be all right out here? - Where are you going? - Gotta make a call. Hey, this is Chloe. Please leave a message and I'll call you back. Hey Chloe, it's me. I know it's late. I just wanted to tell you that I miss you guys, both of you. And I want Benny to know that. And- and I hope he's happy and excited. He knows how much he means to me. Tomorrow might be different. So just tell him I love him. - Hello? Dan. - Yeah. - Where are you? - I'm inside, why? What's wrong? - Something is out there. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Where'd he go? - Who cares? It's almost 6:30. - I got the login info from Mikey. I'm gonna make a hotspot from my phone and upload the virus from the barn. - Dan. - When it's time detonate the machine. - Dan, I need to get out to the machine. - Wait till I get back. Come on, come on. - Bradach. - Casey if you can get the power on, do it now. - Got it. You all right. - Yeah. - You really know nothing, do you? - I got an idea. What do you want? - I am here to ensure the natural order, your extinction. It happens to every civilization. And it will hurt. - What are you? - I am nothing but a messenger. - Dan, I got it. - There's no help. There's no one coming. - Casey, go. Fix the machine. - Are you all right? What's wrong? - You are alone. - Dan. Dan. - You will fight them. -And you will both lose. And you shall... ...all die. - Fuck that. - Dan what's going on? Where are you? The hell Dan. Dan what's going on? Are you all right? Dan, come on. Dan! - You naive human being. - Get away from my sister you old son of a bitch. - Are you okay? - I've been better. - Can you fix it? - Yeah, I think so. - What is that? - I don't know. - Oh shit. It rises. - What do we do? - We get help. I can fix the machine, but the detonator's busted. There's another one in the barn. - I'll go. - Wait. - I love you. - I love you too.

What I can tell you is that the full light force of the American military stands ready. - Can you confirm or deny that our weapon systems are still down? - Um, we're slowly coming back to, but as you now know, let me be clear.
