(gentle music) (tense music) (gentle music) (sobbing) (screaming) (screaming) (gentle music) (door creaking) [Aman] Come on I know your faking. Come here. Come here. Come here. (gentle music) Lie back down. Pretty but stupid. (sighs) I'll be back in a minute mama. (door creaks) (tense music) (gentle music) (tense music) Arman? Arman? Where the hell are you? I'm on my way to the rendezvous point. Problem? Oh, no problems. The package will be on the flight. (tense music) (gentle music) So it is with heavy hearts that we say goodbye to Bryan. Beloved father to Allie, beloved husband to Paige, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. In the Lord we pray. [Crowd] Amen. (indistinct speaking) You know dad would have hated this. He would have wanted this to be a celebration of his life. Not some depressing... Enough, Allie. Please don't start today of all days. (sighs) (bright music) Allie? ... Hold on. You need to go Seth you know how my mom is. Just a sec. Call me about Jared's party, okay? Okay. (sighs) Yeah sure, whatever. Come in. Didn't know you were back, Allie. You were out when I go home. Seth gave me a ride. Yeah, I got that. I would have been happy to give you a lift if you didn't wanna walk. It's only a couple blocks, mom. How was your last day of school? Fine. Did you say all your goodbyes? Yep. You didn't take the lunch I packed. Can I make you something to eat? Nope. How about you give me something more than a one word answer. What do you want, mom? School sucks. Life sucks. I'm not anorexic, okay? No. It's not okay, Allie. We don't talk anymore. Did we ever? Fine, let's talk. What about the car that you and dad said you were gonna get from me? I feel like I'm a prisoner here. You're not a prisoner, Allie. I promise I get you something once we're settled in Iowa. I just don't think it's a good thing for you to be driving while you're still emotional. Do you. Do you wanna talk about dad? No. I definitely do not wanna talk about dad. I know this is a really hard time for you. It's a hard time for me too, Allie. And I was hoping we could help each other through it. I can't. I'm sorry. (gentle music) Oh, Bryan. (gentle music) Oh, great. Allie? Honey? (tense music) (door creaks) (Allie sobbing) (tense music) Bryan. (Allie sobbing) (tense music) Bryan. (sobbing) (tense music) Allie? (sighs) Same recurring nightmare. Yes, it's always the same. I just never know when it's gonna hit. Maybe the change of scenery will help. Possibly. I know you don't agree with me moving us to why Iowa. It's not the move in particular I object to Paige. I just don't recommend any big changes after experiencing a personal loss. You know that. I know. I can work in a small town as well as in a big city. Maybe better, less distractions. And my next book's not due from months yet. I'm just concerned that you'll be very isolated. That's perfect for thriller writing. And have Allie. At least for the summer, till I can enroll her in a new school for her senior year. How is Allie adjusting to the thought of moving away? She hates it. Honestly she probably wouldn't go except she knows that was what Bryan wanted for us. That's a strong motivator. Okay, last question. Then we're off the clock on your last session here. If you had to use one word to describe how you feel most of the time since Bryan's death, what would it be? Overwhelmed. Is it possible that feeling stems from the fact that you feel like you have to tackle everything by yourself? Yes, of course. I mean, Bryan's gone. I have no family, a few friends, you know, being bit of a hermit. But you're not alone, Paige. For example, have you given any thought to a grief counseling group? Honestly, not really. I don't feel like I wanna share. Then don't. Just listen. Paige, I keep bringing this up only because I'm sure there are people in these groups who are going through similar issues with their own kids. And it might also help with the loneliness that can come from starting over in a new place. There is a local meeting of this particular group right in Hicksley, not far from the house you've rented, as your therapist, but more importantly as your friend, promise me, you'll at least go once. I promise. Good. I'm really gonna miss you, Dylan. Oh, ditto. You do know Donna is gonna kill me if you don't keep in touch with us, right? (both laugh) (bright guitar music) (dog barking) (bright guitar music) Just wow. It's not exactly like the online pictures. What a dumb. Allie. What? It is. Come on. Better get moving before the moving trucks arrive. Why even hire these guys if we have to schlep boxes around ourselves. I really appreciate those of you who shared tonight. Thank you. It's not easy to do. We're all here for each other. Only a phone call away, if you need support. All right. (indistinct speaking) (gentle music) (gentle piano music) So sorry. I did not mean to scare you like that. I was lost in memories, I guess. It's understandable. Meetings like this tend to bring out a lot of that stuff. Stuff we'd usually prefer to forget. They say it's good for you. Yeah. So is a root canal. (laughs) True. I um, I saw you come outside and thought I'd come introduce myself. I remember what it's like to be new. I'm Willow. Nice to meet you, Willow. I'm Paige. I lost my husband Chad, eight months ago in an industrial accident. That's my standard greeting, here anyway. My husband Bryan died of a heart attack. It's been a little over four weeks. Ouch. Glad we got that out of the way, right? Oh, you probably think that's really strange. I just try to never say sorry for your loss. I'm really tired of hearing that phrase. Me too. You have kids? Yes, a 17 year old daughter, Allie. You? 14 year old boy, Evan. What do you think of group? It was informative, I guess. But you were hoping for more. Am I right? I don't know. I just... Feel lost? You wanna regroup? Rethink the rest of your life. Just don't know where to start. How do you know that? I've been in your shoes. Sorry, of course you have. I um, might be able to help actually. Hold on. (gentle piano music) Here. Dianne? I'm sorry, who is this? Someone who can help. I'm not sure I understand. You will. She changed my life, Paige. Trust me. Give her a call. You'll see. (gentle piano music) Yeah. Hi. You must be Paige. No, please, don't get up. Pleasure to meet you. It's nice to meet you as well. Can I get you anything? No, I'm good. Thank you. I'm glad Willow gave you my number, and that you called. I'm not sure why I did honestly. Let's call it kismet. You know, meant to be. As I mentioned on the phone, I lost my own husband five years ago in a drunk driving accident. The farm was the only thing he left me. So it was important that I do something good with it, you know? You have I looked it up online after we spoke. Cooperative community of women helping women. That's something to be proud of. Yeah. It's a unique place. Reflect, relax, rejuvenate and really talk to people who understand. It's impressive, Dianne, what you've built from a plot of land. Thank you. It's my own little mommune, you know. Mom, commune, get it. (laughs) I like it. (both laughs) So what now? Well, there's a fee of course. I have plenty. No, Paige your a known writer, I'm sure you can cover it. So it's not just about the money. I'm very selective about who I invite to the farm. 'Cause it's a commitment. Commitment? Well I ask each woman to spend at least three months. Three months. I just rented a house for the next year. I know it sounds like a lot, but we invest a lot into the farm and into each other. And really a day or two, or even week doesn't really fix anything. Does it? No, I guess not. If you want, you can take some time and talk it over with your daughter. She. She's the one who found her dad. Oh. I am so sorry, Paige. Sounds like she needs the farm then. Maybe even more than you do. Yes, I think so. Dianne this is the first thing that's felt right to me since Bryan died. I'd love to bring Allie for the summer if you'll have us. Okay. Thank you. (gentle music) Dianne warned me about this. Geez. My phone has no service. I'm sure there'll be lots to do without your phone, Allie. How am I gonna keep in touch with my friends? I'll ask about a few days off. But we made a commitment here, so let's stick to it, okay? You made a commitment. Not me. When I told you about this place, you agreed to it. Yeah, that was when I was going stir crazy in our craptastic house before I realized that the farm is in the middle of nowhere. (bright music) It looks more like a prison than a farm. Yeah, strange. (gentle music) They're here. Welcome, I'm so glad you could make it. You must be Allie. I'm Dianne. Nice to meet you, Dianne. This is Kianna my right hand and general manager. I don't know what I'd do without her. Welcome to the farm. So glad you could join us. You're gonna love it here. I'm sure we will. Kianna will take your car down to our parking lot, and then she'll take care of your larger pieces of luggage. Keys please. Oh, okay. (Dianne, Paige laugh) Well, let's get you girls started on the tour. It's a large piece of property. There's lots to see. Dianne, I'm curious what's with all the high-tech security? Well, we are just women and children here and it is a bit remote. So we felt it was important to take extra safety precautions. Makes sense. So this is our main dining room. Wow, it's nice. I think I was expecting a bad girl scout summer camp from 70s for some reason. Yeah, it actually did have that look originally but I used Chad's life insurance money to update what I could after his death. This is so cool. Thanks, Allie. A bell will chime through the speaker system at mealtime but if you're hungry in between just come in anytime there's always something available. Oh Thank God. My dad was always the cook in our home, so. Allie. This is Chef Joy. She makes all of the farm fresh food that we grow ourselves here into these amazing meals that you will love. They're incredible. I'm sure they are. All right, follow me there's a lot more to see. (Dianne sighs) Sorry about the hill. You get a nice workout in. (laughs) But these are the main cabins, as you can see. And up ahead, this is the living quarters for the teenagers. So Allie you're gonna be sharing a room with Samantha, it's 4A. Go ahead and check out. Moms are just down the way. [Woman] Hey, Dianne, how are you? Hey. Oh, but I thought... Yeah, we found it better to let the teens feel independent, you know, let them feel like grownups here. It'll strengthen your relationship with Allie. You'll see. Hi Leslie. Hi roomie, I'm Sam. I'm Allie. This is a cool room. Is that my bunk? Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Ah, good. You girls are getting acquainted. You wanna take your new roomie for a tour, maybe before you meet your mom at the lake? Sure. Follow me, Allie. We'll start at the barn. There's roosters, goats, and some chickens out back. And this really cute calico who just had kittens. We can hold them if you want. Yeah. I like animals. Wait till you see them. So adorbs. See you later, mom. See? It's getting better already. So with our greenhouse and this garden we really have just about everything we need. - Hi. - Hey, hi. This is Casey and Dawn. Mary and Sandy. And you'll meet everyone else in time. It's nice to meet you all. I'm Paige. My daughter Allie is around somewhere probably cuddling kittens. (all laughs) I thought you said there were only women and their kids here, Dianne? Oh yeah. That's Jon. He's our handyman. I keep forgetting he's new. He doesn't live on the property, and we really needed some help. So he's actually a widower as well. You know, he hasn't spoken a word since his wife died. How sad. Mm-hmm. There's more. And I saw your Jimmy Kimmel interview. I was so nervous. Were you? Of course, I can imagine. Oh, perfect timing. This is Sam's mother. Tessa, this is Paige. She does all the fishing for us at the lake. Well that's 'cause I'm the one with my own bait kit and knife. Actually Sam is the one who does all the fishing. I'm just the cleaning crew. Well, it's nice to meet you Tessa. You're daughter's already made my daughter feel very welcome. Oh, that's so nice to hear. Gosh, she could really use a new friend. She's, um, had a tough time. Allie has as well. Well then I'm sure they'll be good for each other. I hope so. Um, so I'll see you later? Maybe we can have dinner together. I should be done with my chores by then. Lovely, I'll look forward to it. Yeah, great. Same. Okay, I promise we're almost done with the tour. Let's get you settled in building two. I swear. Her tongue literally turned purple. (chuckles) No. That's so funny. Um... So Justine and her mom left the farm, you know, because she's not your roommate anymore. Yeah. It was weird though. She didn't even say goodbye. Just took off. I thought we were friends but. Bummer, she seems really great. Yeah. She was. I'm so grateful for Samantha, she's really making Allie feel at home. Allie is a sweet girl. Here maybe. (Tessa chuckles) It's like, she's a different person now. (Sam and Allie laughing) I like it. (Tessa chuckles) The farm has that effect on people. I don't mean to pry or anything but you know about Brian now and... Oh, that's not prying, we all share here. Joe is still alive actually. He was, um, abusive. That's why I always carry this knife with me. I just can't get out of the habit. So sorry, Tessa. I assume you did all as usual? Yep. Called cops, moved us into a crappy little apartment, even filed a restraining order, but it didn't matter. After the last attack, if Dianne hadn't taken us in, I don't know what I would have done. I'm so glad she could help. Me too. We've been here almost six months now. Six months? I know I need to get Sam back into school but I just... I feel like right now we just really need to focus on healing. Right? Right. I got it, mom. Oh. Thanks, sweetie. You're welcome. Lemme go back and wash so the kids can hang out. Oh, but I can... You can do it another night, I'm sure you've had a long day. If you don't mind, - [Tessa] Not at all. - Thanks. Sam is amazing. Glad you like your roommate. (whispers) Yeah. Feels strange though being in separate buildings. I'm 17, not seven, mom. I know. You like it here? Yeah. I didn't think I would but things don't feel as bad as they did back home so. I'm really glad, Allie. Me too. (gentle music) Hello? (gentle music) (tense music) Someone there? (gentle music) (tense music) You're a busy lady. Took me a bit to track you down. Oh, I'm sorry. I've just been crazy work mode the past few days. Walls were kinda closing in on me so I thought I'd bring my office outside, get some fresh air. How are you settling in? Good. Chores are giving me time to think through things. Reevaluate what's really important. Good, and that's the idea. Maybe I'll come up with inspiration for my next novel. (laughs) I wouldn't be surprised. Is there something else? Yes, actually I forgot. I promised Allie I'd ask about us getting out of here, run some errands. Maybe grab some other daughter time. I'm sorry Paige. I thought we discussed this. There's no leaving the compound during the initial three month commitment. At all? No. The outside world just brings back bad memories. It's problems and stress. It undoes all of the good self-improvement work that we do here. What if I have an emergency? Well, you would be welcomed to go, of course, you couldn't come back and Allie would stay here without you if that was her choice. I would never allow her to do that. She's 17, Paige, and she's nearly a legal adult. So as far as I'm concerned the decision would be hers. I didn't sign up for this, Dianne. Okay look, I understand that this is all new and I realized there's the urge to go back to the comfortable routine that you knew. But Paige try to keep in mind it's that same routine that got you here in the first place. I know that. I just, ju- - Give it a chance, Paige. I promise you won't regret it. I think I'm already regretting it, Dianne. (sighs) Trouble? No, not yet, but keep an eye on her. "It's a prison, not a farm" Oh, that's an understatement, Allie. Sorry? Oh. Sorry, I thought you were talking to me. No I was just venting. You okay. Not really. I wasn't aware that we'd be trapped here. Trapped? Oh, right. Sorry, I thought you knew it's kinda one of the big rules around here. No. Dianne neglected to tell us. I swear, I just wanna take Allie and get her out of here. Go back and give Dianne a piece of my mind and... Don't. Just don't. What? Why not? Dianne can be difficult. Difficult? She has no idea. If she thinks that I'm going to be... I get it, trust me. I do. I've been here half a year, remember? But you're new here, so try to follow Dianne's rules. You're-your're just here for three months anyway, right? No biggie. Is there something about Dianne that I should know, Tessa? No. No, um... No, Dianne's great. She just, she kind of controls things around here. So you don't wanna get on her bad side. All right? Okay. So I'll see you when I get back from the lake. Okay? Okay. (birds chirping) (gentle music) Does say it's electrified. That's something. (gentle music) (gentle music) Ah! What the hell are you doing? Get off me. Let me up. I promise I won't try it again. Just get off me. Wait a minute. Wait. What are you doing? Why did you do that? What is wrong with you? Obviously, I didn't see that. I guess I owe you an apology. Sorry. (gentle music) (gun cocking) (sighs) Allie. What? I'm hungry. The blue berries are for everyone. Pick them, don't eat them. Okay, mom. So have you always been perfect girl? What? No. Aha. I swear. Let me guess. You broke your mom's favorite vase and blamed it on the dog. No. You stole a bunch of munchies from the local convenience store. I got it. You became a drug mule and... , Allie. I picked locks, okay. Bull... It's true. My dad used to lock me in my room so I finally picked up a lock pick set at the local pawn shop. Watched a buttload of YouTube videos, and practiced till I got out. You've got to show me. No, no way. I don't do that anymore. Come on, Sam. I'll wear you down. I promise. Please! What is that? What's what? Allie? Wow. Just wow. I know. It's beautiful. This is where my mom and I fish. Let's take a little break. We're gonna get in trouble. Come on, Sam. We're too young to never have any fun. Where's that lock picker spirit? Come on. Lock picker spirit? Come on. It's amazing. Fine. But only for a few minutes. This is nice. Told you. (bird croaking) Oh my gosh, what are you doing? (Allie laughs) You're going to regret that. (Allie laughs) Damn it. Damn it. (sighs) Damn it. Not sure I'd want those to be my first words spoken after a long silence, but to each his own. (breathing deeply) I heard you, Jon. So you can talk to me. I came here to Thank you, and I'd like to help you if I can. I do owe you one. Okay, it's up to you, of course. Wait. Please, don't tell Dianne. Please. Give me a reason not to. How much do you know about the farm? It's a self-sustaining co-op. Why? I was hoping we could talk about you. I'll get to all that I promise. You don't know anything else? What are you hinting at? It's just not as self-sustaining as you might think. So Dianne's having financial problems. Yes. Big ones. She charges a hefty fee and that's three months straight. I don't know. Maybe she's using it to upgrade this place or on jewelry or drugs or who knows what? But she's in trouble. How do you know this? Because I saw a large pile of overdue bills. You were snooping in her office? No, no. I was fixing a lock on her cabinet, and a large stack of papers fell out while I was making the adjustment and I- - Why are you telling me this? I obviously can't tell anyone else. And another thing, why are you pretending you don't speak. Look, we can't talk here. Okay? I'll find you later this afternoon after your chores. Please just give me a chance. I'll tell you everything I know. Okay? (door creaks) So your mom is thriller writer? Yeah. And your dad is an English professor? He was, yeah. You must've done really good in school then. Especially English. Sometimes. He didn't really like Los Angeles though. He wanted to live in a small town, small values. My mom too. She's an artist. And good one. But it got hard after my dad, after he left. You never told me she was an artist. Well, I guess that doesn't matter here. It's all work not art, right? Then why aren't you two working? (tense music) (birds chirping) I can't believe this. Don't bother arguing it doesn't do any good. Sam, wait there you'll be in room number six, Allie will be the number seven today. (door creaks) Am I getting bread and water too? You're gonna stay here for a bit while you think about your selfishness. Instead of picking food for everyone, you were busy fooling around hanging out with Sam on the dock. That kind of focus on only your own pleasure isn't acceptable here, Allie. There's always a list of chores to complete. I was just trying to have fun for once. I wanna talk to my mom. This is solitary, Allie. It's designed to give you time alone to think. No one can visit you here. (door creaks) (crow cawing) (Jon knocks) So talk. I'm listening. And not about Dianne we'll get to her later. Wanna talk about you. My wife, Elizabeth, she didn't die. What? I know that sounds bad, but just let me finish. She's my ex-wife and she essentially kidnapped my daughter, Melissa, and she brought her here it is almost three weeks ago. Why didn't she go to the police. She still has full custody. And I still don't have any real proof. Just suspicions. Based on? I found out where Elizabeth might've taken Melissa by hacking into her computer. I'm not proud of it, but I didn't have a choice. (laughs) Hacking into... Who are you? I'm an IT guy. But I was always a handyman before I got into computers. So this is not a lie. And the silent widower bit. Okay, uh... That was a lie. I've never done anything like this before. I thought I might blurt out something stupid if I spoke. So I just, I handed Dianne and note with my sad story on it. I couldn't think of another way to get in here. And you haven't found them yet? No. And I don't know why. (gentle piano music) Oh my God. I didn't mean to startle you. Well you did. Holy crap, I think you gave me a heart attack. Sorry. Sorry, I just wanted to make sure that you were okay. I mean it was so quiet and all... Wait a minute, how did you get in here anyway? Lock picks remember. Never go anywhere without them. Thought you told me you didn't do that anymore. I may have stretched the truth a little. What are you doing anyways? Did you know them? I better get back to my cell before Dianne comes to get us. (door creaking) That's the problem with being the silent widower where I can't talk to anyone to find out more. You didn't really think that one through, right? No. I was just so angry when I discovered she took Melissa. I wasn't thinking straight. Maybe they were here, but then they left. My God, I don't think so. And you think they have something to do with Dianne's financial issues? Yes, I do. At least, I hope so. It's the only lead I've got. So what now? I was hoping you had an idea. Kianna has my keys. I guess I mean I handed them over. You have a car, right? A truck, yeah. Why? You've had little luck so far, So maybe... so maybe we leave the farm... But you can't leave, right? Right. Stay late. Put a tarp in the front seat of your truck, I'll sneak out and I'll meet you in the parking lot. That was a fast plan. It was the plot in one of my books. Okay. So do you know where you wanna go? Yeah. Someone who can give us some answers. (birds chirping) You're here later than usual, Jon. Whatever you've got left can wait until tomorrow, right? (gentle music) I think that's enough introspection for one day. Yes. More than enough. Good. Then let's get you back to your room. Yeah. (tense music) And Sam? I got her first, so she's probably already cleaning the rec room with everyone by now. - Hey. - Can you give me a warning next time? Sorry. I just wanna get out and back before they notice I'm not in my room. Here. Keys and keycard. How's that. Nice. (tense music) (beeping) (tense music) Tell me again while we're here. I ended up at the farm because of a woman in this group. It's the only connection I have so it seems a good place to start. That's her. Paige, it's been so long, how are you? I have been at the farm. But you already knew that. I'm really glad that worked out for you. Are? I don't know why your acting so strange, but I've got to get back to my son. No, I want some answers. What do you want? I wanna know what Dianne really been doing at the farm. (tense music) I don't know what you're talking about. She pays me. All right. That's it. What do you mean? Diane pays me to find women, preferably ones with money. Maybe a kid too. Women who have lost their husbands are struggling in some way. She needs the income for the farm. So I was a mark. You fit the bill. And it's not hurting anyone. I mean, if anything it helps them. Yeah, you should be thanking me. What about Elizabeth and Melissa? You know them. Yes, of course. I introduced them to Dianne. And what happened, Willow. Nothing. You know, I heard they didn't like it there so they left. She's lying. I can't say anymore, okay? It's nothing personal. Nothing personal. Allie is still in there. I wanna know what the hell is going on. Look, I can't say anymore. Okay? Please, okay? Please. Look she'll kill me. Melissa is my daughter. (tense music) She sells them sometimes. Sells? What are you talking about? Black market. It was only supposed to be once. Justine and her mom, they were difficult. There was no family to miss them. It was just supposed to be them. And that was it. But Dianne... But Dianne needs some more money. Elizabeth and Melissa? I don't know. She doesn't tell me anything. Okay. I swear. Okay, I don't know. (mumbles) Wait, wait. Let her go. We got what we wanted. ... Your friend Willow handles procurement. Yes. It seems that way. God, this whole thing sounds crazier every time that I think about it. Agreed. You do realize that you and your daughter could be next on the list. So could all the other women at the farm? No, I don't think so. They're not as attractive as you and your daughter, so they're not as... Valuable. Yes. , Jon you've got to tell someone. Who? The FBI? I don't know. Is human trafficking under the FBI's jurisdiction? Oh, we don't have any real proof. Yet. Yet I think it's time that I hacked into Dianne's computer. He knows the key card swipes are logged. Maybe he forgot something. No. Something's not right. Keep a close eye on him tomorrow. I wanna know every move makes. You got it. You were doing chores when I got in and I fell asleep right after dinner but I'm really sorry for getting you in trouble yesterday, Sam. So don't sweat it. Justine and I always got in trouble. Her mom even ended up in solitary. Really? Yeah. For yelling at Dianne about putting her daughter in solitary. Jeez. I'm definitely not telling my mom about it then. Yeah, probably a good idea. Yeah. Allie? Just forget about Melissa and Elizabeth. Okay? I wish we could have done this at night. The door will be locked and who knows what else. Yeah, you're right. I'm just nervous. I'm excited. I would have done this before but I didn't have anybody to be the lookout. Just hurry, okay. Unlike you see on TV hacking into a computer is not easy. Give me a minute. Sorry. I just don't know how much time we have. I'm in. (tense music) Looks like the foreign was deep in the red for quite a while until a very large lump sum was deposited. Don't jump to conclusions, Jon. That might've been for Justine and her mom, not Liz and Melissa. Okay. You're right. But that's quite a deposit. Yeah, look right afterwards a chunks of it got transferred. I bet that was for Kianna. It's a good bet. A day later there's another much smaller transfer probably to her friend, Willow. Shush money. Dianne went through the rest pretty quickly too. I still don't really understand why do this when Dianne can get chunks of money, life insurance, or otherwise from people like me. Looks like the farm was heavily entailed when Dianne got it. Maybe she got tired of the ongoing struggle decided she needed a surefire way to dig herself out. She said she used her husband's money to fix up the place Maybe she overspent and then ran out of funds to actually keep the place going after renovations. Maybe both. But why trafficking? That just seems like a crazy solution. Why not go to the bank and get a loan or something else? Possibly she tried. Maybe there's not enough equity left in the place so they turned her down. Yours till seems so insane. Desperate people do desperate things, Paige. (gentle music) Dianne is coming, hurry. I'm going as fast as I can. Damn it. Running takes time I don't have, I need to log out. Dianne it came as a bit of a surprise for me too. Sorry, Jon and I were hoping for some privacy. Oh yeah. No, no explanations needed. I'm not your mother. And besides, sometimes the best way to heal is to share your troubles with someone else. You're right. (door creaks) I'm sorry for the... I had an apparition to be there without my tools or. It's okay. It worked so. So. Yeah. Damn, I didn't print anything, I didn't get our evidence. We know it's there. And we know a bit about the trail of money now. Yeah. I'm just frustrated. I hear you. But we got in once maybe get lucky and have another opportunity. Yeah. Yeah. (gentle piano music) Thank you, for helping me. He was on your computer. How it is password protected. I don't know, he was definitely on it. I was watching him as instructed, saw them through the window, docked around the corner so they couldn't see me. Damn it. There's something else. Jon speaks now. What? I couldn't hear what they were saying but he and Paige were very chatty. What are you gonna do? I gonna find out who we're dealing with. (Tessa and Paige laughing) Okay, here we go. Wow. Tessa, you are really good at that. Years of practice. I thought Sam was the expert. You know, she's so good at fishing, but she just doesn't like any of this gut stuff. Hey Tessa, since you've been here for so long can I ask you a question? Yeah, sure what do wanna know? Do you ever remember a woman being here named Elizabeth or Liz, with a daughter Melissa? No, no, no. I don't know anyone named that. Are you sure? For a minute there it seemed like you did. No, no. You know, I thought for a minute that I might. Oh no. Tessa, are you okay? Yeah, it's just nick. It happens all the time. I just, I'm gonna go to the office and get a bandage. I'll come with you. No. I mean, no you go on I'll catch up with you later. If you're sure. I'm sure. Wow. Tornado season. Funny mom. I wanted to apologize for how I was back home. I just, I felt like you were always on me about something. That's because I'm your mother and I worry about you. I know. I'm just, I'm really happy we came here. That's something I wanted to talk to you about. Okay. I think we should leave the farm. Leave why? I feel we'd be okay on our own now. And it's really expensive. You never worried about money before, and I thought you paid an advance. Yeah. So what is it? I'm not a kid anymore. Just tell me. Does it have something to do with Elizabeth and Melissa? Where did you hear those names? Does it? It does. I want us to get out of here before it all gets. Okay. Okay? You wouldn't say something unless it was important. So just tell me when and I'll be ready. 17 not seven, huh? Yeah. I love you, you know. Let you know when I can get us out of here, okay. Mom. Yes. I love you too. So he has a sister. Paige just asked me about Liz and Melissa, I don't know what to say. What do I say? , Tessa stop panicking. Just take a breath. And sit the hell down you're bleeding. I want you to think carefully. What exactly did you say to her? Nothing. I said I wouldn't and I didn't. Then we have nothing to worry about. I guess. I don't know. I don't know why she asking? What does she know? Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God, we're gonna be in so much trouble. Goddammit Tessa, chill the hell out. Okay. If you don't hold it together so helping you and Sam are off the farm. No you said that if I kept quiet... Then do it, keep your mouth shut. Just everyone calmed down and let me think. Okay, I want you to go find Paige, be her friend. You know nothing. So nothing is wrong, right? (tense music) Okay, I'll talk to you later. We can still stay right? For now. But. Go Tessa. Okay. (tense music) That one is becoming a liability. Agreed. And if word gets out the farm gonna shut down. Is Aman ready? Yes. But with Willow, suddenly MIA, I thought we were going to hold off a bit. No screw, Willow. We've got people sticking their noses where they don't belong. We can't afford to waste any time. Tessa and Sam I've been here longer it's only fair that they have extra chores. I know. It's just annoying. Agreed. You know what, why don't you go on, I've got this. Thanks mom. Oh no, I'm sorry it all my fault. (gentle piano music) To hell with it. (door creaking) (suspenseful music) What the? (suspenseful music) It's okay, I'm not gonna be a pack mule for much longer. (suspenseful music) (door creaking) (suspenseful music) (door creaking) (suspenseful music) (tense music) Who are you? What do you want? Who cares? Please help us. Elizabeth and Melissa? Yes. Do we know you? No, I'm Paige. Thank God you're still here. We can't go anywhere. Sit tight. I think I know a way to get you guys free. Then hurry please. And be careful. Kianna brings us food super early in the morning before anyone wakes up and then comes back again before mid-breakfast to take us for a bathroom break. So she'll be back soon. Got it. I'll be careful. Trust me. I'll be back as soon as I can. (tense music) I found them. Elizabeth and Melissa I found them. They're okay. What? Or how, what? I'll explain everything on the way I promise. Right now we need bolt cutters. Bolt cutters. Yeah, yeah, I have some in shed but... Let's go. Quickly. We have a small window of opportunity. (birds chirping) (Jon breathing heavily) I can't believe Kianna knew where they were this whole time. So focused on Dianne. Me too. Don't beat yourself up about it. Let's just get them out of there. (door creaking) I told you I'd bring help. Greyson Greyson? No this is Jon. Why? Why would you bring him here? What do you mean? He's your father? Isn't he? We came to the farm to get away from him. I don't understand. He's an abuser. You just brought him right to us. More lies, Elizabeth. Don't listen to her, Paige. You've never seen me be abusive or even angry, really? Have you? No, not really, but. Stay away from us. Why would you let your mom turn you against me, Melissa? I love you so much. Well you don't know how to love. This is crazy, Paige. You got to believe me. I can help us all out. I can get Liz and Melissa, and even you and Allie outta here. You just, you got to trust me. Don't do it, Paige. Why didn't you tell me your real name, Greyson? (tense music) Paige. No, no, no, no. Leave her alone. Greyson. [Melissa] No. Do you want the same thing happen to your mother. Give me your hands. Please, please. Greyson, let her go. Let her go, stop it. What are you doing? Greyson, [Melissa] No, no, no. [Elizabeth] Stop it. Stop struggling. [Elizabeth] Please, please. Melissa, Melissa. Dianne can have you two for the black market for all I care. She doing me a favor. No, no. Paige. Paige Paige, please wake up. Please wake up. Paige Paige! (rooster crows) She's narcoleptic, I swear. (phone ringing) Aman, where the hell are you? Yeah, I know there isn't self service here. I'm glad that Justine and her mother worked out, I think I find the same with Liz and Melissa. I see you wired the funds. Excellent. Did you hear that? Nevermind. Just hurry the hell up, okay. I'm gonna need the services of your friend, Milo. Yeah, I'm gonna give you a file when I see you. No, I don't need to know how I just- I just need them to disappear (tense music) Hold this to your head, you're bleeding quite a bit. I'm sorry, I didn't know. Greyson is very good at playing the chameleon. That's how I ended up married to him. Damn it. I should thought I was so busy focusing on freeing you two, I never thought to ask how you and Melissa got here. We saw something we shouldn't. Melissa couldn't sleep. She has insomnia, which gives her migraines. She came to building two and woke me up, on our way back to her room. We saw them dragging Justine and her mother away. Who was dragging them? I don't know. Two guys in all black with hoods. We followed them into a van. The women were limp. Drugged, I think. Drugged? Oh... We stupidly we thought we could help them. We only ended up getting ourselves caught. We were taking a solitary for awhile. Solitary? Long story. And we were removed. We've been here ever since. (suspenseful music) Wait a minute. Let's get you out of here. Just hurry the hell up. (item creaks) (tense music) Sam, wake up, wake up. Is it 8 a.m. already? Allie what's the matter? I need your help. Stay here. I'll bring them up. I have a little something to say to these two. (tense music) So Liz- What is this? (tense music) They got away. Obviously. What happened? I came to give them their bathroom break and I got ambushed. By two chained up women? One who's a young girl. No, Melissa was gone. It was Elizabeth and Paige. Paige? (both breathing deeply) Sorry. I'm weak. They didn't feed us much. It's okay. You have to get to the cops. I've done that before. Trust me. They can't stop him. No one can. Then call the number I gave you for Dylan Norris. He's my therapist. He and his wife, Donna, are really good friends. They'll do everything they can to help you. I know they will. How are you gonna catch up with Greyson? He had such a headstart. I think we're going to be faster since he's carrying Melissa. If he's gonna the run, he's gonna need supplies. I think I know where he'll go. (suspenseful music) Don't worry, sweetie. I can get you out of here. Soon it's gonna be just you and me. And we are gonna be on the road- - That was impressive. I'm gonna check on Melissa. Liz, in case you need this. (suspenseful music) Melissa, Melissa. Honey, Honey. Melissa! (whispers) Melissa Mom. Your safe now sweetheart. What are you doing here? Here. Does he still have the white truck. Yes. Check the lot. You'll need this for the front gate. Aren't you coming? My daughter's still here, I can't leave her. Thank you. Go! Don't stop for anyone. (tense music) Stop, stop. You ruined everything. Greyson. You took my daughter from me. No, you did that yourself. Goddamn you. (tense music) He was trying to kill you... I didn't know- didn't know what to do. You did great, Tessa. You saved my life. I couldn't sleep. You weren't in your room. So I was afraid. It's so early so I thought maybe you wanted to get something to eat so I came to the kitchen to find you and I saw this. Tessa, I need you to calm down and listen to me. We need to get the girls. Okay. But first I have to tell you something. I already know. Can you help me? I know we're Kianna keeps the keys to our cars. Perfect. But I have to wash my hands. Go ahead. I'll get the girls. I'll meet you in the parking lot in half an hour. Okay? (suspenseful music) Come on, come on, open. My goodness. Come on, hurry up. I'm trying the locks and solitary were easier than this one. Come on, come on. I got it. (door creaks) You rock. Oh Thanks. Allie, wait... I had no idea about Justine and her mom. I thought they just took off. It was so screwed up. But I did know about Melissa and Elizabeth. You knew. I saw them being taken from solitary and not back to their rooms. And I mean my mom said that if I said anything that they'd make us leave the farm and that my dad might find it and I just... It's okay. It's okay. They're gonna be okay. We're gonna get them help now. I promise you. (gentle piano music) (phone ringing) (recording) You have dialed 911 a dispatcher is coming on the line to assess your emergency and connect you with first responders Hang up the phone Allie right now. Lucky I came back from my file. (tense music) Look Aman, I promised you two packages and here they are. (tense music) Just have to wash my... (sobbing) Oh, hey... (panicked mumbling) Screw this ..., I'm out of here. (breathing heavily) (tense music) What the hell did you do to them? Seriously, Aman? You didn't notice someone falling down here you idiot. (tense music) Let them go, Dianne. Paige, you really shouldn't have involved yourself in things you know nothing about. You left me no choice. Let them go on now. [Dianne] Go, go. (van engine roars) (tense music) No one hurts my daughter. (tense music) No, Allie. (van engine roars) (tense music) (megaphone) This is the FBI. FBI show me your hands. Show us your hands. Stop now. Put your hands out of the window. Allie... Show us your hands. Put your hands out the window. (megaphone) Do not proceed any further. We've tracked the son of a bitch for six months. (siren wailing) (birds chirping) (dog barking) - Just a bit. - Okay (Sam and Allie laughing) Food's almost ready, girls! (door bell rings) (both) I'll get it! No, I'm gonna get it. No! Your supposed to be doing your homework. Oh, Paige had no idea you were making such a spread. You know, I live here, you can put me to work. No need, it's almost done. All right, well then I'm doing the dishes. No argument with that. You gotta deal. I hate doing dishes. (laughs) What the heck is this mom? Whatever it is, it's heavy. Oh, hang on. Let me- - I got it, mom. (gentle piano music) ARCs of my latest thriller. Advanced reader copies. Lots of them. Congratulations, Paige. What are you waiting for mom? Let's see it. (chuckles) (gentle piano music) Wow, there it is. I guess you were a little bit inspired. You could say that. (all laughing) (gentle piano music)
