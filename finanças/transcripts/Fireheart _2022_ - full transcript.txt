Hey, that's a great idea. Clear the way! Whoo! We have a third-alarm call from the Clock Tower! There are people trapped on the top floor! I'm not Georgia. I'm Captain Georgia! It looks like a bad one! Hurry, Probie! We have people to save! Look out! Whoo-hoo! Ember, stretch a line, hook up to the hydrant and extend the ladder. I've got to get to the top floor. Whoa! - Aaah! - No...! You see that amazing girl? Well, it's me, Georgia Nolan. And this is my faithful dog, Ember Nolan. She's sweet, right? Oh, and by the way, the man freaking out is my dad, Captain Shawn Nolan. Let me tell you about him. Captain Shawn Nolan was the best and bravest fireman in the whole wide world of New York. He saved so many lives. - He was a legend! - Yeah! But he couldn't save my mom when she had a baby... who was me. At first he tried to be a fireman and a dad at the same time. Oh! No! No, no, no, no! That was very difficult. So he became a tailor instead, like his dad. He said he didn't mind because he loves me so, so, so much. Along with Ember, we have a super great life together. And now I'm training to be a fireman and save lives just like my hero Captain Shawn Nolan used to do. It's my dream. It's my destiny! Oh! Emergency at the chemical factory! Georgia, no! Emergency! Fire on the zip line! - Georgia, no! - Whoa! Whoa! Emergency on Brooklyn Bridge! - But I got it... - No, Georgia, no! - ...under control! - No! - The doctor says it's nothing. - Stop with that! - Oh? - You could've broken your neck. But Ember was the fire truck. - And we had to go save people! - Georgia, enough! No more rescues inside the house or on the street, or at the bottom of the sea, or on top of a mountain, in the jungle, in the desert, or on the moon. Dad, there can't be a fire on the moon. There's no oxygen. I know that. Listen to me. No more fireman games anywhere at all. But I have to train to be a fireman if I want to save lots of people just like you. Georgia, I'm a tailor now. I don't save people from fires. I save them from holes in their pants. Do you think I would be a good fireman? Yes, you'd be a great fireman. You have the heart for it, but... In that case, no one can stop me. Not even you. I have to tell her, Ember. The longer we wait, the worse it will be. Nice hat. I may need to borrow it for the spaghetti later, though. Or else there'd be a meatball emergency. Yeah. Funny. Georgia... Do you know why we say fireman and not firewoman? To save time? No, Peanut. Because girls aren't allowed to be firemen. - It's against the rules. - Why? Well, people don't think girls are strong enough for such a dangerous job. But I'm training so I get really strong. And I'm brave. As brave as any boy. You know I am. I do know. There's no one who deserves it more. But I'm afraid those are the rules. - Will the rules change? - I hope they will. But these things can take a long time. And I wouldn't want you waiting around for something that might never happen. But you can be a seamstress and work with me! Is the sewing machine on fire? No. In that case, no, thank you. Georgia, I don't how else to say this: you will never be a fireman! Oh, I'm sorry, Peanut. I know it's unfair. I know. One day I'll have to tell her the whole story... Just not yet. Okay, Ember, let's go. I promise I'll always protect you. Approaching the auditorium now. It's just like the other fires. Colored smoke, intense light, and the same strange music. Enter with extreme caution. You know what happened to the others. - Send water. - Sending water. Wait for my order to open the nozzle. We're going in. Georgia! Come on! Ooh! Yes! Oh, yeah, hmm... Georgia, this is your last call! - Morning, Daddy. - Finally. Now hurry up and eat. We have sew much to do today. Argh, you're hilarious. You have me in stitches. Oh, you're as cute as a button. Well, we are cut from the same cloth. We interrupt the Champion Spark Plug Hour with a special news flash. Yet another Broadway theater has been hit by the arsonist. Mayor Jimmy Murray wants everyone to calm down. He had this to say earlier today: Everyone needs to calm down. You know what we need? Here is Georgia Nolan for WKBZ interviewing Shawn Nolan. I heard you hit a new alteration record today. Is this true? Before I answer, have we punned out yet? Of course not. In that case, it seams I'm going to be inducted into the sewing hall of fame. Nice one. Do you think it's the arsonist? I don't know. Anyway, I'm happy you're not on that truck. - What do you mean? - Well, don't you remember? When you were little, you wanted to be a fireman? - Did I? - Pff... Oh, yeah. Very, very badly. That's silly. Girls don't get to be firemen. Yeah. You could have lived your dream if you were a boy. Come on, lazybones. Ember! Stop! Girls can't be firemen? Give me a break. You wanna know what I think, Ember? Well, I'll tell you anyway. All these years of training at night, in the cold, in the rain, in the snow are finally gonna pay off. I've worked and worked and worked and now my chance is coming. I can smell it. Can you smell it? Smell harder. - Wait. I hear something. - Huh? Ember, shh! Oh! Look. Look. The police. Wh...? Ember. Ember. Jimmy Murray. That's Jimmy Murray, the mayor of New York! - Shawn! - What's he doing here? Dad? - OK. - They know each other? I'm going down! Oh, Ember, don't fuss. They'll never see me. Ooh! - Oh! - Listen to me, Shawn. This arsonist has already burnt 40 theaters. And get this, with no flames, just blue and red smoke. And creepy music. The newspapers spoke of missing firemen... Nah, idle gossip, maybe one or two. - Hah! - Come on, Jimmy, spill it. Alright. All of them. - All of them? - What do you mean? The firemen that go into the theaters, they don't come out. They just disappear. You're telling me that all the firemen in New York have vanished? All but one. Oh, no, no, no, Jimmy. I know what you're gonna ask me, but I'm out. Hey, Shabbat Shalom, y'all! How ya doin'? Don't forget to vote Jimmy Murray! Polls open on Tuesday. Not Saturday. Good, right? You got it? Okay. No excuses, now. The show must go on! I gotta do something now. So I need you to run the fire investigation, just for a few days, for old times' sake... whaddya say ol' buddy, ol' pal o' mine? Oh, please, don't say... - No. - No? I appreciate the offer, Jimmy. But I'm a tailor now. Sorry. I'm sorry. Listen, I know why you left, Shawn. But this is your chance to get over what happened. Finish your career with a bang. I'll never get over it. - Hmm. - Good night, Jimmy. The whole city is in danger. Nobody's safe... not even your daughter. - I'll need a team. - Yes! Oh-ho-ho... As many guys as you want. No, no, no. A small team. Just a chemist and a driver, a fast one. And I want all the evidence you've got. - Photos, samples, everything. - Done and done! Your team will be at the firehouse tomorrow, Shawnie. Excuse me. Captain Nolan. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. Oh, my gosh! What kind of tailoring emergency? It's a corduroy disaster. That does sound serious. I know, so I have no choice but to leave you alone for a couple of days, and I'm worried. Relax. Everything will be fine. Ember will protect me. Hmm? Honey, you know what? Don't work. You know? - Take a personal day. - Oh! I didn't know we had personal days. We do now. You stay home! Of course. I have a radio. I'm all set. Dad, go deal with that corduroy disaster. Wait, wait, wait! Okay, okay! - Uh, love you! See you tonight. - So, here's the plan. I join Dad's team, I catch the arsonist, I save the city, they change the rules, and I get to be the first fireman... woman. For hair, a mix of engine oil, black shoe polish and honey. Marshmallow in the cheeks to form the jaw. Putty for the nose. For thighs, a mix of sawdust and cucumber peel. Pillows in the shoulders. Egg crate for the stomach muscles. Mango for the biceps. Don't worry, Ember. Dad won't recognize me. And for the mustache, carpet fringes. Huh. Hello. Why, yeah, I do fight fires... with my bare hands. Thanks for giving me a better idea. Hey, sister, looking for a mister? What? Oh! Okay. Too much. Too much. I knew it was too much. I said it. Creep! Oh! Uh, you're squishing my mangoes. Aaah! Wow. Manhattan, here I am. Whoa. Extra! Extra! Read all about it! Panic grips city! Arsonist strikes again! Plus: the Chrysler Building is now the tallest building in the world! - And couple does the jitterbug. - Wow! Hey, excuse me. Hey. Hey. Excuse me. Excuse me. I'm looking for the Times Square firehouse. Hey... - Hey! Whoa! Hey! - Watch it, okay! - Go back to Jersey, you bum! - Whoa! Hey! You want a pickle? We got, uh, garlic, and, uh... extra garlic too. Smells like it. Um, could you point me in the direction of the Times Square firehouse? Sure, so, uh, what you wanna do is take your first right onto Who Cares Street. Then head straight down to, uh, oh, what is it again? Oh, right. Do-I-Look-Like-a-Map Boulevard! Whoa! Thank you, sir. That's so kind of you. Lousy tourist. Didn't even buy a pickle. - Garlic pickle? - Argh! Taxi! H... Hello? I mean, hello! Anyone here? Hey! Hi! Ting. Pooh! Huh... Oh! Huh... Are you one of the volunteers? Mm-hm. Do I know you? Mh-mm-mm-mm-mh. Come on, then. You're late. Pfff! Okay, I'm Captain Shawn Nolan and I will be running the fire investigation. We have an arsonist to stop and we have 800 firemen to find. Now, I know you aren't professionals and it's a... Oh, yes! Yes! An amazing speech! Goosebumps! I'm telling you. We have no time. Let me introduce your team. Now, here's the brains of your operation, Ricardo. - Your chemist. - Actually, sir, I would describe myself more as a physicist, given my experiments on Einstein's theory of quanta in photoelectric effects in kinetic energy. That's my man! He talks like a calculator. Where did you graduate college, Ricardo? Actually I, uh, do my research at home in my basement. - Hmm... - Where I live with my mama. Very nice. Home school. Amazing. You did that with your kid, right, Shawn? Oh... yeah, yeah, yeah. Jin's your driver. Fastest cabbie in Manhattan. Everyone knows him as the Checker Cheetah of Chelsea. Yeah, I'm the Cheetah. The Cheetah? How old are you? - Fifteen, sir. - Fifteen? - Twenty-one. - You just said fifteen. No, I said twenty-one. - He said fifteen. - No, no, he said twenty-one. Oh... And who's this third one? I only asked for the two. - Wait. You didn't find him? - Me? No. Who are you? Oh, me? Uh, I'm Georg... uh, Georg... Gior-gio, Giorgio, Giorgio. Joe! I'm Joe! I'm Joe! I'm a fireman. I'm Joe the fireman! Fireman Joe. A fireman? Are you sure I don't know you? No! No, no. I live, I live, uh, far away. Uh, I'm a man. And I'm strong. - I'm strong! - Take him. - I'm a fireman. - He has experience. Alright. Welcome... Ugh. - ...aboard! - Ho! Oh, uh, I'm a sweater. Uh, and I eat a lot of mangoes. - A lot of mangoes. - Can I uh, talk to you? - You can taste it... - Tell me this is a joke. Nah, they're the only ones who accepted this suicide mission. I mean potentially suic... You know what I mean. I'm strong and a fireman! Okay, team, suit up! Suit up! Suit up! - Excuse me? For what? - Maybe a fire? Oh! Ooh! - Oh, good gravy! - Good luck, my friend. City is counting on me! I mean, you. Counting on you. I'm actually doing this? Hoo! Come on, you know there's an alarm, right? We shouldn't be wasting our time. Hey! Easy there, Cheetah! Relax. I'm an expert driver. In a cab, not a ladder truck! One's red, one's yellow, same diff! The Cheetah's back! Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wrong way! Turn around! Turn around! But this is my shortcut. Normally I'd ask for a tip. Normally a fifteen-year-old kid doesn't drive a ladder truck! I'm twenty-one. In Cheetah years? - Yeah, baby! - Are you okay? Oh no! Oh! No, no, no, no, no! Oh, not good. Nice. Wha... That's it. Whoa, whoa. Whoa! Oh... Beautiful butt hair. Ho-ho-ho-ho! Oh, I could be doing alterations right now. Whoa... Whoaaa! Whoa. Whoa. Whoa! ♪ I got pickles in my pocket and I don't care who knows... ♪ Help me! Help me! Help me, please! Watch out! Dividing the width of the truck by the width of the road, I calculate a 99% chance of death! Jin, did you hear him? Jin, did you hear him regarding our chances of survival? Jin, stop the engine! Jin, stop this truck! Stop the truck! Jin! Jin! Captain, look! We saved 12 seconds! No more shortcuts allowed! No more shortcuts allowed. Okay, the theater is on the next block. Get ready. Tanks on and follow my orders. - Any questions? - What? Oh, hi. What did I miss? The street! Oh, Captain, are we there yet? - Not yet. - Hmm... Whoa! - Wow! - Wh... What is it? I don't know... Ricardo? It could be potassium or copper acetate, maybe lithium chlorate. But that would only make sense for the flames, not the smoke. I need to run tests. At home. With mi mama. Arsonist, we're coming to get you! Yeah! We're gonna kick your flaming multicolored butt! Yeah! - Hmm. - Captain, what's going on? Some arsonists like to come back to the scene of the crime, so keep your eyes peeled. Keep my eyes peeled, got it. Hmm... Who is that? Only the most luminous star on Broadway: Laura Divine. Captain Neil, Chief of the New York Police Department. Shawn Nolan. Happy to have you on the fire investigation, Captain. With you here, the police, led by yours truly, can now focus on finding the missing firemen. Glad to be of service, Captain. Amazing! We secured the perimeter, and there are no civilians inside the building. - Empty! - Thank you, Captain Neil. Okay, I'll go see what we're up against. - Joe, stretch a line. - Right away, Captain. Ah! Really hope no one saw that. Slow down, Joe! Did you even check the... Aaah! The water pressure. That's one crazy hose. It's not the hose. Stay calm! Stay calm! Okay, panic! Panic! I miss my mama! I want to go... It will be fine! I'm coming, buddy! Eeeh... You said you had training. - I've been training for years. - Where, clown school? Never mind. Come with me. We're gonna water the front. But if the smoke contains cyanogen, you'll die of hypoxia in only 29 seconds! That's why I need you to collect smoke samples. And that's why I'm going home! Great! Okay, we all know that firemen who go inside burning theaters disappear, they vanish, but that will not happen to us because we will stay outside watering the front until the fire is out. Then and only then will we go inside and look for clues. Okay? Jin, extend the ladder. - Extend the ladder! - Ugh! On it like a bonnet. Let's get vertical, people. Top floor: ladies' hosiery, Brylcreem, and arsonists. Get a load of me. - I'm a natural. - Oh! Jin, wake up! Wake up, please! - He's asleep! Jin! - Stop, Jin! - Hold on! - Whoa! How is this possible? I have no idea! Back up. We shouldn't be in here. That wasn't the plan. We're getting out now! Captain! Captain, I saw something move. - Never mind that now. Come on! - I got this! No, no, no! Joe, that's an... Oh, for Pete's sake! What is it, ignore the captain day? Ahh! I know you're here somewhere! You show yourself! I thought I disposed of all of your kind. You... You don't scare me. Yes, I do. Aaahh! In the name of the great city of New York, you're... you're under arrest! How cute. Here. - Catch. - Oh! Aaah! Ah! What was that? The arsonist. Were you planning on dancing with him? Stop that! We have to get out of here. Right now! Come on! Oh, thank goodness! They're alive! They're alive, everyone! Come quickly! Quickly! You... - You just saw a ghost! - A ghost? Okay, that's where I draw the line. The occult? - I am done! - I don't know what it was. What I do know is I almost caught the arsonist. Hey, Captain, I was just telling them abo... Telling them what? That it was a fiasco? Actually, Comandante, I would say it's a success considering we are still alive. Of course you're alive. You ran! True, but in my defense, I didn't get very far. Firemen go in together, stay together, come out together. - That's how this works. - Yes, Comandante. And Jin, explain to me how you fell asleep. Not me, Jackson. The Cheetah never falls as... What? Oh, hi. What did I miss? Oh... Okay. Sometimes I "faint" when my emotions are too strong. I was "fired" by the cab company for "allegedly" running over a newsstand. I guess I "should" have told you, Captain. Hmm. Anybody got anything else to tell me? - Mm-mm. - No, Captain. We won't disappoint you again, Captain. I wasn't talking to you, Joe. You lied to me, and that's it. I don't wanna see you around here ever again. Captain, Nolan. My men haven't seen any more signs of smoke. You're clear to enter and start your investigation. Thank you, Captain Neil. I'll use the stage door. Captain! Captain! Go back to wherever you came from, Joe. I just wanna say you're right. I'm not a real fireman... yet. But it's all I've ever wanted. I've read every single book and I train every single day, but firefighting for real is... well, it's a lot different. Of course it's a lot different. It's not a game. And pretending you were a fireman put all our lives at risk. I'm a father, Joe. I need to go home at night. You understand me? Yeah. Yeah. Believe me, I do. But I really wanna help you stop the arsonist. Please, please give me another chance. Hmm. Complete honesty from here on in. Do you understand? Oh, thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you! Yeah, yeah. Okay. Now follow me. Yes! Cheetah loves that guy. He's the cat's pajamas. Oh... What is going on? This isn't normal, is it? No... We're about 40 miles from normal. - Um... - Oh! Sorry. Everything is burnt to a crisp and yet still standing. How could the fire burn the entire auditorium but not destroy the rest of the theater? That's the question. Mm-hm... It's burning, but it's cold. - Don't touch it... - Oops. Unless I say you can. Could have been worse... Good grief... Okay... To collect clues, you have to use your senses. Touch... Sight. Sound... I didn't say taste. I was gonna say smell. Do you think that's what happened to the firemen? I... I mean, vaporized? Hmm. One step at a time. First we have to figure out the origin of the fire to know what happened. The origin, got it. Each fire has a story. We are looking for various marks and patterns imprinted by the smoke, heat, and fire. And when we find these patterns, we can trace the path of fire back to its origin. Good golly. Hey! Am I boring you? - Dad! - What? Uh, had, ha... I had... I have... Pfff! I have something to show you. Come here! Uh... This better be good, kid. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's good. Come here. Look. Hurry up. Come on. Look! Look at the impact! Whoa... Whatever it was, it was thrown from here... From the stage. He's not an arsonist. I mean, he is, but he sees himself as a performer... Doing a show, with lights and music. Interesting... but just a theory unless we can figure out what caused that impact. Hmm. This? Hmm? The arsonist threw it at me. Mm-hm. You just found the origin of the story. Well done, son. I like that you call me "son." Firemen are a big family. Let's take this back to the firehouse. Huh. Origin of the story! Yes! Ooh! Sorry... Something in my throat. Hey, Joe, come on! Ah, this is great! We'll give it to Ricardo first thing in the morning to analyze. I haven't seen you this happy in a long time. Yeah? Well, you've known me since this morning. Oh, of course. It's just, uh, I feel like I've known you my, you know, my whole life. Yeah, really? - Oh, God! - Ow! Say hello to the brave men who are going to bring the arsonist to justice! You called the press, Jimmy? Sorry. City Hall leaks like a sieve. Let today put an end to the rumors about there being fewer and fewer firemen to protect us! - See, here... - Oh! ...is Joe, a truly unique fireman. He's strong. He's a real man. Don't look at me. You look into the camera. You're working for my re-election. - Look happy. Now go! - You're crushing my hand! Oh! Don't forget to vote Jimmy Murray. Polls open on Tuesday! The show must go on! Captain, Jimmy is using this crisis to get re-elected. Yeah, tell me something I don't know. Okay. I... I think he's the arsonist! Jimmy? No way. He'd sell out his own grandmother to get re-elected. Actually, he did. She's doing three years in Sing Sing... But arson? Nah, he's not that kind of guy. - I know you're friends, but... - Don't run, Joe. - Firemen walk with purpose. - But I am walking. It's an expression, son. It means don't jump to conclusions. Oh, yeah, no, I knew that. I knew that. No, you didn't. But I like your spirit. Alright, Joe, go home. Come on. Tomorrow will be critical and I need you rested. And, yeah, I'm happy. I've missed all this. I knew you did. And you gave it all up for me. Hoh! Hoh! Gotta fly! Oh! Oh! Hey! Hey! Ember! Ember! Hey! Hey! Hey, Ember! - Yes! Yes! I'm home! - Hey! Hooo! My little doggie doggie-doodoo. How are ya? Did you girls have a nice day? What's this smile you're giving me. That's sweet. Hmm? Let's go see what Georgia's been up to, shall we? She won't believe the day I've had. Upstairs. Hey, Georgia, I'm back! I'll be right up! Hey, Ember! Stall him! Stall him, please. Georgia? Are you there, Georgia? How was your day? Ruff! Yeah, mine was pretty rough too. Can I come in? Wha...? - Hey, Dad. How was your day? - What? I'll be with you in one second? Did you see that, Ember? Gotta switch to decaf. Wow. You're so good under pressure. Dad, tell me everything that happened with the corduroy crisis. The what? Oh, right! The corduroy crisis! Oh! Oh! It was... It was... terrifying. The lines, they were going the wrong way. - And there was the texture... - Oh, wow... What? I just think you're amazing, and I think I'm lucky to have you as my dad. Well, it'll be over soon, and we'll get back to our quiet, safe and peaceful little life. Tsk. I can't wait. Sorry, boys. Last-minute change in the program. I have to deal with the last four of you. Then I'll be ready for my grand opening. But this time, all of New York will be my stage. Have a good day, my love. Dad! Dad, how are you? I've been thinking. In... in... in... my sleep, in my dreams. Why don't you take Ember with you today? - Huh? - She'd love it. Look how happy she is! Aren't you so happy, Ember? Oh, you're so happy! Yes, you are. You're so happy. I... I can't take her. Who would look after you? Dad, stop treating me like a baby. Don't you trust me? - Of course I do, but... - Then prove it. Take her. It'll be good for my independence. Are you all right, Peanut? Do you want me to call a doctor? - Oh, no, no, I'm good. - Huh. Hmm... - You'll stay home all day? - Tsk. Just like yesterday! Okay, then. Ember, let's go! Bye, Ember. See you later. Yes, I will. Oh, yes, I will. - Yoo-hoo! - Huh! You again? Argh! Do I look like a taxi cab? What in the world...? Buenos dias, Comandante. Hey, chief! We gonna nab this no-goodnik fire ghost or what? Morning, Captain! One cream, two sugars, right? Hmm. Yeah, that's right... We came in early to get a jump-start on things. - Hmm. - Oh, what a sweet doggie. - Hello, boy. What's your name? - It's Ember. She's a girl. Oh, Ember. I'm so happy you're here. We're gonna have an amazing day. So that's how it's gonna be. Captain, Rick is analyzing the fireball. He's trying to find out why it didn't explode. Inside the ball, there's a mixture of sulfur, charcoal and potassium nitrate... plus a trace of nitro glycerin and sorbents. Translation, please. Gunpowder and dynamite. Oh, hey, don't worry, Captain. The glass is unbreakable. - Oh, I see. - And over here... Jin is making some amazing improvements to the truck. It's Cheetah. I already added my hanging dice and my wooden-bead seat cover. So, Captain, can I drive? - Of course you can't drive. - What? But I'm the best driver! Am I the only one who sees this as a problem? Jin is awfully fast when he's awake. And he does know all the quickest routes. Amazingly, I need a driver who's always awake. So, look what we've installed. Ow! What? Oh, hi. What did I miss? Nothing. You can drive. Skiddle-dee-do! The Cheetah is back! Captain Neil delivered all the evidence compiled so far. Photos, samples, even audio recordings. There's only the one theater left on Broadway. The mystery is, how does the arsonist get into the theaters when there are police everywhere? Isn't it obvious? He's a ghost! Huh? A ghost? Aah! Oh... Can you drop the silly ghost theory, Jin? Okay. Let me try. Nope, I can't. It's too good. Enough! We only have one more chance to catch the arsonist. - Ricardo? - Hmm? You take a shower. And then keep analyzing that fireball. Okay, Comandante. Jin turn this truck into a rocket. Done and done, Captain. - Good briefing, Joe. - Thank you. You come with me. I'm gonna train you. Welcome to the fire simulation room. Ooh... It's really hot. Temperatures can reach 2,000 degrees. Relax. Get to know your worst enemy. He is fierce... - Oh! - Powerful. Hey! Where you going? Okay. I can do this. Give it to me. What have you got? - I can do this. - Okay. Okay, Joe, relax. I know you're strong and in excellent condition, but technique... Wait, wait! That was a back draft. I told you, don't run. Walk with purpose. But firemen have to be... fast and brave. You take recklessness for bravery. - Aaah! Oh! - Reckless. You didn't analyze the situation or assess the risk. That's not bravery, it's just stupid. Um, I think I get it. Can you pull me up now? I'll think about it a little longer. Captain... Captain, that's not funny. Come on... Captain! Very impressive, Joe. - You're a fast learner. - Oh, thank you, Captain. That means so much coming from you. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Don't get distracted. - You keep the nozzle turning. - Yeah, yeah! Of course, Captain. Sorry, Captain. It's funny, you remind me of my daughter. - Huh? - She's about your age. Really? Yeah, that is funny. Hmm. Yeah, she wanted to be a fireman too. But you don't think girls should be firemen? No, of course they should be firemen. So why didn't you teach her what you're teaching me? - It's complicated. - Why, because she's a girl? No, because she's my daughter. I mean, I love her and I worry about her every second of my life. - Aw. - And I have to protect her. I mean, she's lots of attention, she's delicate, she's sensitive, the world freaks her out... Aaaah! Hey! What the heck was that? Sorry, Captain. Yeah, you'll see how fragile I am. It's the Lyceum, Laura Divine's theater. - Hurry, Jin! - The Cheetah's on it! Hoh! Hoh! Wake up, Jin! On it! Hey! Easy on the ol' pie hole there. Well, that works... Ricardo, how's it going? Are you getting any closer? Hold on. Can I call you later? Pauline, turn that off! Right away, Miss Divine! Okay.

So, Pauline, is it? - You work for Miss Divine? - Yes. Her personal assistant for two months now, but I've been kicking around Broadway for 20 years. Uh-huh. Just don't have much to show for it. Anyway, you must be part of the mayor's heroic fire team. That's right. I'm Joe. Oh, I saw your photo in the paper. I never forget a handsome face. No, no... Ahem. Oh. Oh... Uh, thank you. I'm so glad you're here, Joe. I'm a little jittery. Actually, very. But nothing scares Miss Divine. Say it! Unless I'm the arsonist? Uh, well, I'm just doing my job, Miss Divine, covering all my bases. I grew up cleaning houses and babysitting for rich people who told me: "Now, don't you kiss the baby, Miss Laura." "Don't you eat off the china, Miss Laura." I saved every penny I earned so I could get out of there and come to Broadway. And when a dancer quit... ...guess who was ready to step in and save the day? - You were. - Yes. Now, respectfully, get the heck out of my theater. Pull me back up, Pauline! Right away, Miss Divine! Miss Divine, I can't let you continue to rehearse. You gotta come with me. Would you say something? Will you sign my face? Not that! I wanna fly! Yes! Yes! Higher! Yes, Miss Divine! I wanna fly! Higher! Whoa! Pauline! You just clipped the wings of an angel! Oh... I feel like a failure in my life. There's nothing I can do. Oh, Pauline, please don't worry. I'm... I'm pretty sure she's gonna recover. Get me out of here right now! Miss Divine, there is no need to get upset. Everything is gonna be fine. Where's the crane? Don't worry, Miss Divine! Get me the crane. See? Sounds like she'll recover. - I mess everything up. - Don't be so hard on yourself. Maybe this is a sign that it's time you follow your own dreams. I never gave up on mine. Easy for you to say. You're a man. Not really. I'm all girl. My name is Georgia. Georgia? What an amazing costume. The mustache is very convincing. It's my dog's butt hair. It was the only way. If I catch the arsonist, they'll have to change the rules. Then I'll be the first fireman woman. Oh... The first... firefighter. Firefighter. Yeah! I love that. - You're very inspiring. - Hmm. It's not the first time you've seen him here? No. He's always sneaking around. Hmm. Okay. Psst! Be careful... Joe. Hmmm. The music... Aah! I'm so sorry, Captain. Are you okay? I'm really, really sorry, but we have to go back to the firehouse, okay? Can you breathe? I hope you have a good explanation. I do. I really do. I am so sorry for your... for your throat. Experiment number 26: integrating the music recorded at the scene of the fires. Here we go. Oh, you were right, Joe. The music, it activates the fireball. Jiminy cricket! Oh... I've never seen a material create light in reaction to sound. - The work of a true artist. - Or a ghost... - Bu-bu-bu-bu-bu. - Mm-hm? From the future. No, no, no. Ember. Ember, come back. Sit here. - Sit here with me. - Approaching 90 seconds. Oh! Oh! Oh! Ember! Ember? Captain, Jin, get down, get down! What's going on? What's happening? The light has hypnotized them! The last five notes cause the explosion! - I cannot move. - Rick! Rick, it's spreading. We have to get them out of here right now! I cannot move. I cannot move! Hey, it's okay. It's okay to be scared. I'm scared too. But you can still be brave. Rick. Rick, look at me. Go in together, stay together, come out together. Come on! Okay. Okay. Oh, wow. I didn't expect that. Oh, I did it. I did it! Yes, I did it! Looks like the training paid off, Dad. Captain Neil, we know how to stop the arsonist. I repeat, we know how to stop the arsonist. Oh! That's fabulous. We are on our way to Laura Divine's theater. But Captain Nolan wants you to evacuate all of Midtown. I'm all over it! Guys, I'm sorry I was hard on you. I expected nothing, and at first that's exactly what I got. But this turned out to be a pretty darn good crew. Ricardo, you saved us in there. Thank you, Captain. But perhaps this bravery was always inside of me, and it was Joe who revealed it with... Big truck... sick. I... sorry. - I'm better now. - Ugh. And you too. Amazing work, Joe. Thank you. Captain Nolan. Good to have you here. We'll have the perimeter secured in a quick 10 minutes. We have everything under control. Thank you, Captain Neil. I'll get my men in position too. - Are you ready? - Yes, Captain! Okay, team, I want 10 lines, inch and three quarters. Open all the nozzles in the auditorium and lock them between the seats. I want all of them targeting the stage. As soon as the alarm starts, we turn on the water and we drown that arsonist. - Great job team. - Thank you. Yeah! Hey, Captain Neil. Georgia! Oh, sorry! Joe! Pauline! - Where you going? - I got fired. But I'm happy! You were absolutely right. It's time for a change. - Time for me to shine. - Well, I'm happy for you. Good luck. You too, Georgia. Well, then, this is goodbye. I just need to fetch my lucky slippers and then I'm off. I'm done with New York. Okay. Well, hurry. The police are shutting down all of Midtown. Everybody move back. Hey, you, pickle guy! Get outta here! Oh yeah, sure. I understand. I understand. - Oh... - Don't boss me around! Hmm... He's here. Turn on the water. Darn it! We've been tricked! The fire isn't coming from the auditorium this time! - Where is it? - Everywhere! It's a trap! Abort! But Pauline just went inside! I have to save her! Get ready! We're going in! Come on! Pauline! Where'd she go? Pauline! Can you see her? You go right, I'll go left! And use your hose so you don't get lost in the smoke. Okay, Captain. Pauline! Pauline! Pauline! Pauline, I've got you. I thought I would perish. - Aaah! - Pauline! Save me! Save me! - Pauline! - Don't let go! Georgia! Georgia, I can't... Georgia! Pauline! - Stop! - But Pauline's down there! - She might still be alive! - It's too late. No, I can't risk losing you both. We have to get out. That is an order! Come on! Come on! I wanted to be a fireman to save people. Sixteen years ago, just after I'd been made captain, there was a terrible house fire with a young couple trapped inside. When we got there, we hacked at the walls, trying to get them out, but it was too late. I couldn't save them. I didn't know how I could go on. I was devastated. And I needed to... I needed to be there for my daughter. She was so little then and I... Anyway, my battalion chief told me that if I... wanted to be a real fireman, I'd have to accept that sometimes bad things happen and there's nothing more you could do. You have to let it go. Shawn! Congratulations! - For what? - The auditorium! - It's saved! - We lost someone, Jimmy. And the arsonist is still on the loose. Oh, I know, I know. Terrible, terrible. I gotta do something. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna put the police. The police are taking over. What? No! I have to stop the arsonist. Jimmy, don't do this. We still don't know where the firemen are. - Hey! - The police will find them. As for the arsonist, he doesn't have any more theaters to burn. He's finished. And I have places to go and people to see. So, Shawnie, get some rest, and thanks for the great show. Show? Oh, by the way, I've been re-elected! ♪ Four more years Four more years... ♪ - I know he's your friend... - Yeah, whatever. We stick to him like white on rice. Like stink on diapers. - Hmm. - Too much, right? Yeah, too much. Hmm. Shhh! Hmm. Three, two, one... Hmm? - Don't. - No, I got this, I got this. Okay, get out of the way, son. No, no! No! Aaah! - Dad! - Dad? - Cupcake! - Cupcake? - Get it open! - There's no handle! Get it open! Get it open. Get it open. Good job, Ember. Cupcake? At least she hasn't lost her voice. Jokes, huh? We'll see how hard you laugh when you're scrubbing toilets at Yankee Stadium. Cupcake, look at you! Look at you, my cupcake. What are you trying to do to my fiancée? Fiancée? I think there's been a terrible misunderstanding. We, uh, we... we kind of thought you were the arsonist. The arsonist? Me? It's just you were always sneaking around the theater. Only because I love this woman and we can't be seen together. Oh, yeah, of course, I totally understand. - Society has to change. - No, no, no, not that. She doesn't wanna be seen with me. Of course I don't wanna be seen with him! It's bad for my reputation to be seen with a sleazy double-dealing scoundrel. But I'm your sleazy double-dealing scoundrel. Oh, cupcake. Captain! Look! The firemen must be down here somewhere. Hey, Cap, everything alright? Jin! Get down here and help Jimmy and Laura! Call Captain Neil. We found something. Sorry, Jimmy, but we have to go search this subway tunnel. Congratulations. She'll make a charming first lady of New York. When she's back in one piece. Out of my sight! Aaah! My arm! Oh! Oh, it hurts. Hey, hey, Captain, where are we? The track for the BMT train. Okay. Okay. Which way, Ember? Go! Go! Joe... I think we just found the lair of the arsonist. What is this place? It's an air distribution chamber. This must be where he rehearsed his show. It's hooked up to the fan like a turbine. Must take a crazy amount of energy to create those fireballs. Hmm. - Captain, come here! - Huh? Rejection letters. From every theater on Broadway. "You belong in a loony bin, not a theater." Yeah... PhD in chemistry. The scientist is a failed artist who's looking for revenge. Broadway was just the rehearsal. The real performance is happening tonight. From the top of the Chrysler Building. What? Hey! I think we found them! - They're alive! - Oh, we did it! We did it! We did it! We did it! We certainly did. I couldn't be more proud of you, son. Well, actually... ...daughter? Look, I know... I know it was crazy, I know I promised to give up this dream, but I couldn't. And doing this was the only way to prove myself. To you. To everyone. Well, no, you see, you said that Joe is an excellent fireman! I mean... I mean, he's me, and I'm him, and when you give me your blessing, they're gonna have to change the rules. - No! - What? No what? No, you can't be a fireman, Georgia. No matter how good and strong you are. - What do you mean? - I will never allow it. Oh! But it wasn't a problem when I was Joe. Yes, but it's a huge problem when it's you. - The job is far too dangerous. - I don't understand. You know it's all I've ever wanted. You gave this passion to me. It's in my blood! It's not in your blood! What do you mean? I'm not your real father, Georgia. Of... of... of course you are. I'm not. Do you remember when I told you about the couple I couldn't save 16 years ago? Even though they were trapped... they managed to pass their baby daughter to me... three months old. Her name was Georgia. I swore to them I would always protect her. If you become a fireman, I can't keep that promise. Look at the danger you're in now. You used "girls can't be firemen" to lock me up at home. That was the only way I could think to protect you. I'm sorry, I was wrong. Georgia! What happened? What happened? Dad! Dad! People despise change. Even those who are closest to you. No. Ember! Ember! Ember! Wait! Wait! No! Ember, come back! Ember! Ember! Ember, wake up. Wake up, Ember. I hate little dogs. Sorry. Wait... Pauline? Pauline is dead. My stage name is Supreme Fury. What'd you think of my little death scene? Too much? We have the same enemies, you and I. The ones who say my art isn't art, that women can't fight fires. We are stuck in their stupid world, held back just because we wanna do something that's never been done before. Your father... is one of them. If we wait for them to catch up, we could wait our entire lives. We don't have time for that. That's why we have to act now. We'll burn it all down and start over. The thing is, Pauline... I might never be a fireman, but I have the fire in my heart, and no one can change that. Not even my father. Wrong answer, sis. You're clearly not ready for center stage. Too bad you'll miss my grand finale. Dad, wake up! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad, don't worry, I'm gonna get you out of this. Dad, no! No, no, no, no, no! Dad! Wake up! Dad! No! No! What? Oh, Ember! Oh, thank you. Thank you, Ember. Oh, Dad. Dad, come back! Come back, please! Dad, you can do this. You can do this, Dad. Dad! Dad! Dad, come back! Please. I smell mangoes. Oh... very funny. Very funny. You saved me. Just... Just doing my job, Captain. Just doing my job. I'm so sorry I held you back. My captain told me that if wanted to be a real fireman, I'd have to accept that sometimes bad things happen, and there's nothing more I can do. You have to let it go. The day that you were put in my arms is the day my life began. I love you, Dad. Okay, you find Pauline, go find the team, and call Captain Neil. Ember and I will release the firemen. Are you sure? Yeah, go save our city, Georgia. Looks like I'm gonna have to get used to this. Captain Neil here. Great job, everyone. We've stopped the arsonist's van 300 feet from the Chrysler Building. - Yes! - This is a great day for the city and for New York's finest. Yeah, yeah, yeah! Come on, I told you. - Mangoes and Ember's butt hair. - Ugh! Did everything smell like dog butt? Look, can we talk about this later? I wanna be there for the arrest. But why, when your chances of actually becoming a fireman are approximately zero percent? Life isn't about percentages, Ricardo, and it can't be zero 'cause I'm doing it right now. - Boom! - You inspire me... 85 percent! Me too, Joe. Georgia, I mean. Sorry, I gotta get used to it, Joe. Georgia. Georgia. Georgia. Mayday! Mayday! She's throwing fireballs. There's smoke everywhere. Oh, I can't see anything! No, no, no. We have to stop her. We have to stop her! Oh! The police cars! And the police! They're hypnotized! And nobody to give me a speeding ticket! Oh, no, no! - There she is! - I see her. No, no, no, no, no! Come back! Come back! Oh! What is she doing? I've no idea, but I think I'm in love. Oh, this is no bueno. Thank you for the ride, sir. Stop talking and save my city. Hey, Captain, you made it! - Where's Georgia? - Oh... about that. There is only one elevator. And the stairs are not finished yet. I need to get up there now! Let the show begin! Seriously? Aaaah! Georgia! Ah... Oh, what...? What? Georgia... Georgia, where are you? - Come over here, quick! - Georgia... Hurry up! Are you alright, Captain? No... My daughter is up there. Oh, dear heavens! - Not there.... - Listen to me, men. I want you to surround the building. Here. Another construction elevator. From up there I could... Get me some ropes and a grapnel. Uh... are you serious, Captain? Georgia. Georgia! Ah! 90 seconds to stop her. Where are you, Pauline? 85 seconds... There! Yes! No! Georgia, look around you. Don't run. Please don't run. Don't run. Don't run, Georgia Nolan. You're a firefighter. 75 seconds. You walk with purpose. Think. You won't make it in 70 seconds. She's too high. Think. Take a look around. 65 seconds. The power! Yes! Where's the plug? Where's the plug? There! Yes! 60 seconds. Can I make it? Platform, pulley, ladder, beam, ladder. It's possible. 55 seconds. That's great, my love. Yeah, yeah... No! No... No. Argh! Okay. Um... Easy. One foot in front of the other. One foot in front of the other. Whoa! Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four! Three. Two. What? Argh! - Hey! - Argh! Show's over. Huh. Yes! No! Georgia! Whoa...! Nobody stops my show, Georgia, not even you. It's my time. So we're gonna take it from the top. Cheetah. At your service. Need a lift, Captain? Pauline! Please stop! Pauline, you're too... you're too close to the edge! Oh, you have no idea, honey. Aaaah! You ruined everything! We could have changed the world! We are changing it. We have the same fire in our hearts. Don't you see? But... But you use yours to harm people. I use mine to save them. Yeah? How are you gonna do that? Gonna drop me like the last time? To calculate the horizontal distance, I'm using 9.81 yards per second... Oh, never mind, just go fast! Here comes the Cheetah! Ah! You see, Pauline? Firefighters are one big family. Thought maybe you could use a hand. - Hi! - That'd be nice. - How are you, Probie? - Yeah, feelin' good. Feelin' good, Captain. Um... Uh... Dad! Do I look like a firefighter? - You are a firefighter... - Oh... I can't believe what a beautiful woman you've become. I've wanted to give this to you for the longest time. It's... It's everything that I found out about your parents. And... now it's for you. Oh... Wow... I look like my mother. And a little like your father. My dad's name is Shawn Nolan. He's the greatest dad in the world and I wanna be just like him. - I love you, Joe. - What? I'm kidding. I'm kidding! But that... that Joe was really something. - Always smelled of mangoes. - Oh, cut it out! Ember, were you in on all of this? Of course. It was all her... idea... actually. I vowed to keep you safe and I was able to deliver on that promise thanks to the heroic men and women, heh, heh, who stand before you today. Don't look at me. You look into the camera. Ow! You're crushing my hand. I know. I know. It's an honor to decorate each of them with a gold medal, for their bravery in protecting the greatest city on earth. We couldn't have done it without you, Ricardo. Thank you, Captain. Please wish me good luck. I'm going to college next year. Well, I'm 100% sure you're gonna do great things. Although given my age and my social issues, I wonder if I have a 93% chance of being bullied and... - Ricardo? - You are right. I can do it. You showed great courage, Jin. This is going right next to my medallion. - You're driving a cab again? - Yes, sir. I'm working on my emotions. Did I mention I'd like to take your daughter out? Hey, Jin, pump the brakes. Oh! Sure. No problem, Captain. No, take all the time you need. Good job, Nolan. Thank you, Captain Nolan. I love you. I love you too. Oh... Now that's true New York spirit. Excelsior! Everyone with me! Excelsior! I'm not crying. I just got some... some pickle juice in my eye. You're crying! Huh? Half-priced pickles for everybody! Not you! But everybody else! Uh! Give it to me!
