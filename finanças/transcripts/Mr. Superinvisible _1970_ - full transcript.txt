(Musical Swell) each molecular combination can always be related to the intensity of the various components of its structure. eh! how i hate the smell of eggs even though these variations may constitute an entity which cannot undergo comparative analysis you understand that huh? well never mind oh boy you're not the only one who doesn't understand me ah, but irene what's the matter you're not jealous are you? dylan do you know the joke of this century? we can put a man on the moon but we can't cure the common cold go see if madame Claire is up huh. go on. he has a bad digestion has also very very bad ideas in his head sounds interesting madam claire but i do hope you're not referring to me oh no doctor i was talking to Dylan. dylan shouldn't eat anything at all. that coffee cake... looks it looks very good this morning you sleep well? well not so bad oh good i always say a man needs a hot breakfast before he can think of science... good boy eat eat you're tired of eggs too huh? hello... yes dr denwell is here bombay? do you know anyone in bombay doctor? ranji's in bombay maybe he needs something hello? hello? peter can you hear me this connection is very bad. listen peter my experiments with a common cold have led to rather astonishing results i sent you a package. ranji, i can't hear you did you say package? yes that's right now you must analyze the contents and find an antidote. i know you won't believe this but ranji you'll have to talk louder louder about later i am losing this connection. you must get geneva back on the line for me i must speak to dr danwell! hello? hello? strange all i could get was that he sent me a package sure upset look if that call comes through again uh madam claire would you transfer it to the institute i'm gonna have to be on my way if i get a chance this morning i'll give him a call from there i have to get my notes together for that broadcast. oh yes that's right i won't miss it for the world i'm anxious to see what you look like on television. where do you think you're going? oh come out of there dylan you know it's not sunday oh well come on it's time you saw where I worked. move over. have a nice day madam claire he saw it drink this maybe this doctor danwell did understand understand? how could he understand how could he possibly know that i become invisible... (Upbeat Music) (Horn Honking) hey there's irene want a lift? possibly it's lucky he drives a piece of junk he doesn't even know how to park doctor did you hurt yourself? oh no no i'm all right i was just thinking about something else yes morning doctor may i see your license please? yes morning you should know it by heart come irene we'll be late. i hope you never get any ideas to park near my new car another gift from mama? why is it a crime being rich? no quite the contrary in my case it's a bonus remember that. what do you mean? in spite of it i work here you are doctor see you tomorrow after you harold hold the elevator morning andre ah morning professor palmerans. dr danwell. is good morning enough or should i say bow wow too i forgot about you uh dylan you never stop trying do you take him thanks andre stay down here you don't have a digger yet uh but you're going to have to make up your mind now my dear eye gene i oh i didn't push the button well i don't know why don't you

that you and i we too we too yes both of us here you see we we've arrived and well you've held up half the institute just to catch an elevator well i'm sorry but you should have waited is that so just remember all's fair in love at all what's war got to do with it excuse me oh there would you like them well put them in number three okay yes have you been checking any of the records on my desk oh no no no no that's strange this morning i found all my papers mixed up oh well that is strange maybe it was dr pochke do you know where he is now no no there is yes he he's in the active vaccines lab he's uh waiting waiting for reaction i think he found him did you hear it did you hear it it was magnificent oh you've never seen anything like it no it was lovely it blew up it shattered every test tube into place but max i i hope you're not forgetting that you have to pay for the damage watch a few test tubes in the cause of science you should have been there i was working on the antidote for virus d injecting the eggs you know and suddenly there was this reaction totally unexpected but magnificent more damage and fragile aren't they would you be so kind as to tell me what's going on today in this laboratory i was sharing with my friends a little scientific joke professor a minute ago i discovered by accident i can create a major explosive power right inside of this egg perhaps a bunker might be more suitable than a laboratory for such experiments dr denver it's late we'd better go downstairs and get ready for the television program yes sir i'll get the virus d miss scott and what exactly do we have here another famous pochke experiment perhaps oh it's really not worth mentioning and what is that oh nothing it's just a real egg these idiotic experiments of yours uh dr pomerantz the virus d is ready now we can go downstairs here to speak to you today is dr peter danwell chief biochemist of the geneva research he could be an actor thank you for many years now we have been trying to find a cure for the common cold we haven't succeeded in finding a cure for the common colds yet however we have isolated a virus which contains all of the known types of coals throughout the world uh doctor can you tell our audience the effects of this new virus well the onset of the uh coal brought on by virus d is marked by long and violent sneezing and extreme weakness caused well by as you see by the loss of appetite now this experimental chimpanzee has been totally uninterested in food for 72 hours that's since his inoculation with virus d is this new virus as contagious as the ordinary flu we're used to you know much more contagious one uncontrollable could infect half of europe are you saying that if this virus were to get into the wrong hands whole countries could be incapacitated well there's very little chance of that may we see the virus doctor well yes the director of our research laboratory dr pomerantz will show you that now now that we have the virus we must move quickly our asian friends are impatiently waiting what good is it without danwell according to the boss dr denwell will probably soon be fired consequently we must bring him here if he's willing to cooperate and work closely with us all good and well if not we know what must are you saying you let our bacteriological weapons simply disappear from under your nose this virus could put an entire armature put and you haven't yet found an antidote i shudder to think what might happen should it fall into the wrong hands i resent that remark please generally she is not speaking about you we're speaking about the wrong hands you know who else would be able to enter your laboratory well lots of people i think it's quite evident that dr denwell has overlooked all the basic measures of security but inspector i i think it should be considered that we have excuse me gentlemen there's no need for panic gentlemen i haven't been exposed to virus d if that's what you're thinking that was just a normal sneeze there's really nothing for you to worry about yes well that will be all for now dr denver we'll call you if we have any other questions oh yes i'll keep the virus defiles for a moment i would like to thank you for your cooperation inspector i assure you dr denver's carelessness shall not be easily pardoned there's no doubt that dr denwale is very absent-minded but he is a scientist of very great value yeah but even a scientist no matter how brilliant must be held accountable for his mistakes maybe you're right do you intend to take action in his case i do of course he'll be replaced it's the next board council meeting aren't you going to do something what do you want me to do they'll replace me at the next meeting and that's that for the next board meetings the day after tomorrow do something in the meantime take action defend yourself how would i defend myself haven't you ever fought for something you really cared about if i lose this job i'll find it nothing to lose more than a job my friend you're also going to lose irene she's a pretty good chemist a pretty good chemist there's a lot more to that girl than just a good head peter the door should

professor potsky is here ah how nice of him to drop it you're joking yeah that's him hmm a mess isn't he in science we don't judge a man's outer prove that by preparing the virus d antidote an antidote's a complex thing it might take all year not that long professor you will learn that i'm not one of your more patient women do i get to know why you want the antidote certainly i may decide to release virus d on the world and i plan having the endodont for protection that should be fairly obvious i'm not stupid you know yeah sounds like they're right around here someplace perhaps i could go get them i'm afraid i couldn't permit that however i shall see that your notes are brought here now where else will you need oh yes i wanted at least 12 dozen eggs big ones like that just any old
