[in Marathi] Lord Ganesha! Please bless me! [in Hindi] May your blessings always be with my family. [coughs] [in Hindi] Does he care about his life? You have spoiled him. He walks in and out of this house whenever he wants. Have you ever told him anything? -[in Marathi] I'm leaving. -[woman] Hmm. [waves crashing] [scooter starts] Good morning, Madam!

[in Hindi] He's fine! [in Hindi] He'll be alright. [in Hindi] I know. [in Hindi] I just spoke to the doctor. [in Hindi] The doctor has recommend a three-week rest. [in Hindi] He says he shouldn't even get off the bed. [in Hindi] Three weeks? [in Hindi] Is he really that serious? [in Hindi] Yes, Raju! He had a heart attack. [mumbles] After hearing this I might get a heart attack. Today is not my lucky day. Nothing is going right for me [in Hindi] What are you mumbling in English? [in Hindi] What about your test? [in Hindi] Weren't you supposed to get the results today? [in Marathi] Mom! [in Hindi] Your son would have been an engineer today... [tuts] ...but I couldn't pass the test! [in Hindi] Again? [in Hindi] Oh, God! This is the fourth time! [in Hindi] I can count, Mom. [in Hindi] Raju... your dad cannot work for the next three weeks. [Lakshmi in Hindi] You'll now prepare for the fifth attempt. Why don't you... take your dad's place... at his job? [in Hindi] Mom! What are you saying? [in Hindi] I'm very busy. How can I do this? Don't be ridiculous! [Krishna] Lift... [Lakshmi in Marathi] Do you want something? Lift... Lift... Lift... [birds chirping] What a waste of space! [lift beeps] [dramatic music plays] [Shawn] Bro, what does your dad do? He works with CBI Mumbai. He's undercover. He's working on a highly confidential case right now. I can't really talk about it. That's so cool! Does he have a gun? Has he shot anyone? Once on an important mission, he killed three criminals. [lift beeps] Papa! There's a blind man in the lift! [kid] Papa! Yes, how can I help you? Good Morning, sir! I'm Krishna's son. Krishna? [in Hindi] Who's Krishna? Sir, your lift operator. [in Hindi] Oh! The liftman! [Mrs. Cyrus in Hindi] Darling, who is it? [in Hindi] Darling, it's the lift operator. [in Hindi] Yeah, tell me, how is your father doing? Sir, getting better. I have come to... fill his shoes? Shoes? [in Hindi] There are no shoes here, brother. -[Raju in Hindi] No, I mean-- -What do you want? [in Hindi] No, sir, um... it's just that… until Dad recovers... I'll work as the liftboy. [in Hindi] Oh, okay. I get it. [in Hindi] So, are you ready to start working today? [Raju in Hindi] Yes, sir! Very good. Very good. [in Hindi] So, go meet D'Souza. Okay? Upstairs. Okay. [in Hindi] Son! [lift beeps] [doorbell rings] [lock clicks] Good Morning, ma'am! I'm here to meet Mr. D'Souza. He passed away, my dear. What? Just now? A year ago. Oh. [Mrs. D'Souza] So, what can I do for you? I'm here to meet the owner of the building. Yes. Tell me. Um, ma'am my father, Krishna, works as a liftman here. I'm here to fill in for him. And do you have any relevant experience? [laughs] [clears throat] [Raju] No, ma'am. Give me a moment. Follow me. [lift beeps] This is lock. This is unlock. Always keep the key with you. Open with a smile. Don't do any small talk. Keep your eyes open for suspicious people. Pets are not allowed in the lift. Give me the key before you leave. And that is your cleaning kit. Aren't you going to change? Do I have to? Yes, you do. [sad music] -[Krishna] Raju... -[Raju] Hm? [in Hindi] get my uniform ironed. [frying pan sizzles] [in Hindi] Perfect! [in Marathi] Hey! [in Marathi] What is this? [in Marathi] Go to the laundry and get it ironed. [in Hindi] Are you a cop? [in Hindi] Are you a doctor? [in Hindi] Are you? Who cares what a liftman's uniform looks like? Lakshmi... please make sure he understands... that it is this very uniform that feeds him! [lift beeps] Princess! [Mrs. Kapoor] The lift is here. [tuts] [in Hindi] Hold the lift. [in Hindi] Yes, ma'am. [cellphone clicks] [sighs] Princess! [Princess] Coming, Ma! [gasps] [Princess] Hah... [lift closes] [cellphone clicks] Ground floor! [clears throat] [in Hindi] Who are you? Raju... your new liftboy. Krishna... the lift operator? His son [clicks tongue] [in Hindi] Princess, put your heels on! [sighs] They hurt my feet, Mom! [in Hindi] Baby, in showbiz beauty is pain! [in Hindi] Come on, wear it. [lift beeps] [in Hindi] What? Have a nice day, ladies! [Mrs. Kapoor] Bloody pervert! [lift beeps] Fifth floor. [woman] Who are you? [in Hindi] I haven't seen you before. [in Hindi] It's my first day. [in Marathi] Really? [in Marathi] I'm Lata. [lift beeps] [in Marathi] Who does he think he is? [in Hindi] Is he operating a lift or a plane? [doorbell rings] [lift beeps] [music playing on the phone] [music stops] [doorbell rings] Keys, ma'am. Your father always leaves at eight. But... I was told it is a 12-hour shift. Very well then. I'll see you tomorrow. I hope you managed to clean the lift. Oh... I did not know I was supposed to do that today. You're supposed to do it every day, my dear boy. Can I start from tomorrow? You can. But you may not. If you hadn't been loitering outside my house these last 31 minutes waiting eagerly to ring the bell to end your shift, you could've cleaned that three times. Now here are the keys. Go do the needful And don't forget the cleaning sign board. [lift beeps] [door shuts] You could use the stairs or give me a minute, I'm almost done. I don't have time. [lift beeps, closes] How come you speak English? I was sent to an English medium school and college. Oh... so what are you doing here then? Cleaning the lift. [chuckles] No, not this, I mean why do you work here? [Raju] Oh... I'm just filling in for my Father. He's a bit unwell. That's sweet. [lift beeps] Good night. [Raju] Keys, ma'am. Have a good evening. [Mrs. D'Souza] Thank you, Raju. I'll see you tomorrow. [door closes] [sighs] [tuts] [water dripping] Tawade! Tawade! Tawade! Tawade! [in Marathi] Oh, Raju! You got a new job? [Raju in Marathi] Uncle... I am an engineer! Okay? [indistinct chatter] [in Hindi] Hey, Raju! Have you started modeling? [in Hindi] Raju... how was your first day? Why are you late? [in Hindi] What do you mean? [in Hindi] It's a liftboy's job, Mom! [in Hindi] I press buttons. [in Hindi] The door opens and it closes! [in Hindi] I press buttons. [in Hindi] Did I study engineering to do this? [in Hindi] Tell me! [in Hindi] And tell me one thing... why do people need a liftboy anyway? [in Hindi] Can't people press buttons themselves? [in Hindi] Why don't you freshen up? [in Hindi] I'll get you some food. I have made pudding for you today. [in Hindi] It feels like a prison! [in Hindi] No! [in Hindi] At least there is ventilation in prison! [in Hindi] I'll go mad. [in Marathi] Eat slowly. [in Hindi] Why are you eating so fast? [Lakshmi tuts] [in Marathi] How's the pudding? [in Hindi] Have some more! [in Hindi] I'm done. [in Hindi] I'm not going there tomorrow. [in Hindi] That's it. [door slams] [scooter approaching] [pen clicks] [Raju] This guy is useless! [Raju tuts] [snores] [lift beeps] [doorbell rings] [door lock clicks] [Raju] Good morning, Mrs. D'Souza! Can I have the keys please? [Mrs. D'Souza] Good morning, Raju. You certainly can. You're 20 minutes early today. I'm just trying to make it up for yesterday. I must say I was quite impressed with the way you cleaned the lift yesterday. [chuckles] Thank you. You fancy a cup of tea? Uh... I better get going. You have time. Come in. [door closes] Ma'am that's a beautiful painting you've got here. It was done last night. Really? Are you a painter? Yes, I'm a painter. How much sugar? One cube. So, Raju, tell me. What brings you to Galaxy apartments? Your father was telling me you're doing your engineering. Ma'am I have a drop. Drop? I failed a first-year subject four times. I'll be giving the exam for the fifth time in the next six months. I'm sure you're going to be lucky this time. If I was lucky... I wouldn't be doing engineering in the first place. Then what would you be doing? [Raju] If given a choice... I'd love to study literature... and pursue writing. [Raju] Maybe work as a lecturer to make ends meet. And what stopped you? My family. You see... kids in India have only two career options. Doctor. Engineer. Have you heard any parent say... that “My son is a writer" or "A lecturer”? [Krishna] Raju... [in Hindi] look at what Mrs. D'Souza has sent. [in Hindi] It's your favorite sweet! [laughs] [in Hindi] It's because you passed your tenth grade. She was very happy. [in Hindi] She has given some money as well. [in Hindi] Here have some. Uh... [in Marathi] Um... Raju... [in Hindi] what do you plan to do now? [in Hindi] I mean... medicine or engineering? -[Raju] Arts, Dad. -[Krishna] Right. Art? [in Hindi] You mean painting? [in Hindi] Like the ones who paint “Please do not spit on the wall.” [in Hindi] Will you do that? You think that will help you feed everyone? [in Marathi] Wow! Brilliant! So, today we're going to study dissection of a rat. Raju... [Shawn] I think he's dead Yeah? Let's continue with the class. So, in this topic... [Raju] Bro, I can't do bio anymore. It's too stressful. [Shawn] What? Relax man. Let's just get through this. We'll study engineering later. Simple. I heard it's really hard. Dude, it's a cake walk. My cousin Darryl studied engineering. And all he does is watch porn and jerk off all day man. That's all engineering is... jerking off... for four years Well... that's basically my whole story in a nutshell. Hm... Raju... it's very unfortunate you're stuck in a situation like this. Let me know if I can help you in anyway. Sure, ma'am. Thank you. Have a nice day! [door shuts] [lift beeps] [in Hindi] How's your father doing? [in Hindi] He's alright. [in Hindi] He'll be up and running soon. [in Hindi] I think I'll go see him today. [in Hindi] Where is the hospital? [in Hindi] In Chembur. -Chembur? -Hm. I'll go see him. [in Hindi] Okay. [lift closes] -Come on. Come on. -[lift beeps] [Raju] Good morning, Mr. Mistry! [in Hindi] My wife wants a diamond necklace for her birthday! [in Hindi] How is this a good morning? [shushes] [in Hindi] I haven't received any action for three months and now she wants diamonds. [in Hindi] I heard it, Papa. I will tell Mom. [in Hindi] What will you tell her? You won't say a word! If you do, I will ensure you'll get double the punishment I get. Quiet! Look at this generation, man! -[lift beeps] -Come. [in Hindi] What will you say? What will you say? Huh? Here, take ten rupees, okay? Come, come. [sighs] [slurping] [sighs] [in Hindi] Why did you send Raju to work? [in Hindi] He works every day. But being a liftboy does not suit an engineering student. -[groans] -[woman in Hindi] See? I told you. But why would you listen to me? He has studied at an English school. He's almost an engineer! Why do you want him to work as a liftboy? He hasn't bought me a new saree for the past ten years. I work as a maid for three houses! And now he-- [in Marathi] Enough. I know what I'm doing. [in Hindi] I am his father. I'm not his enemy. I know why I sent him there. [in Marathi] Just be quiet. [slurping] [lift beeps] [woman in Hindi] Fifth floor. Which book are you reading? The Great Gatsby. [in Marathi] What? Ghas... Ghasbi? F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby. [in Hindi] Get it? [in Marathi] Yes, yes! [in Hindi] You didn't get it, did you? [lift beeps] Fifth floor. [scoffs] [doorbell rings] [lift beeps] -Hi! -[Raju] Hi! Uh, have you had lunch? Uh... not yet. Okay, good. My mom asked me to give you this. Thanks! Is this yesterday's food? Yeah, why? I don't eat leftover food. I only eat fresh food. Uh, so, you can take this back. -But thanks, anyway. -Oh? Can you give this to the watchman then and then bring the box back? [clicks tongue] -Okay. -Thanks. [inhales sharply] I have to tell you though, uh, it's really yum! Bye. [door shuts] [in Marathi] Mom! [pleasant music playing] [in Hindi] Uncle! Did you have your lunch? [in Hindi] No. [in Hindi] No? [in Hindi] My mom made this. [in Hindi] Your mom? [in Hindi] Would you like to eat this? [in Hindi] I'm not hungry. [in Hindi] Okay. [door opens] [Mrs. Kapoor in Hindi] Who is it, Lata? [Lata in Hindi] It's the liftboy, ma'am. [in Marathi] What? [in Marathi] What do you want? [in Hindi] Are you here to return it? [in Hindi] Then do it! [Lata] Hey, listen... what is the name of that book? The Great Gatsby. [tuts] [in Marathi] What's the full name? F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby. [in Hindi] Yeah... good. [in Hindi] Go. [Princess in Hindi] Who was it, Lata? [Lata in Hindi] It was the liftboy, ma'am. He was here to return the lunchbox. -[Princess] Raju! -[lift closes] [lift beeps] So? Best pasta ever! I told you! [both chuckle] [Mrs. Kapoor] Who is it Princess? Raju, Mom. I'll talk to you later. I got to go. Bye [door closes] Shawn... where are you? [lift beeps] Oh, here you are! I was wondering where you were. Nature's call, ma'am. I was also feeling a bit nauseous. I hope you're feeling better now. Is this your book? Yes, ma'am. I love reading. Indeed, a very fine thing to love. I was going for a stroll by the sea... and to buy some vegetables. You should come along. Sure, ma'am. But... what about the lift? I cannot leave it unattended. You most certainly can if the owner of the building is telling you to. Sure, ma'am. I'll be with you in two minutes. Nature's call again? Uh, no, ma'am. Uniform Oh, you don't need to do that. You look just fine Such a task getting a rickshaw here. Actually... I know a convenient way of transport. You really expect me to sit on… Yes, ma'am! [Raju] Ma'am let me assure you Rani is the safest two-wheeler you'll find in the city. She's been with me for two years and has never let me down! And... where are we going to keep the groceries? Right here. Honestly, I'm, uh-- I'm not very sure about this Ma'am, I give you my word. And my helmet! [scooter starts] [Raju] Ma'am! [Mrs. D'Souza] Hm? [Raju] You've never told me anything about Mr. D'Souza. How did you meet him? I was studying at Cambridge University. And I moved to London to work at an art gallery. One sunny afternoon... when I was at a local pub with my boyfriend... a dashing man with a bushy mustache walked in. He was like a Hollywood hero And our romance was like a Bollywood film. We dated... and got married. And I came to live with him in India. Had the most amazing 38 years of marriage. Colin passed away last year. And I'm still here. Thank You. Good night. See you tomorrow [scooter approaching] [scooter rumbles] [scooter rumbles] [in Hindi] Shit! [tuts] [in Hindi] What the hell! Shit! [in Hindi] New tires. New paint. What have I not done for you, Rani? Huh? [in Hindi] At times, I've given up my lunch money to change your oil! [in Hindi] I ditched Karuna on Valentine's Day to get you painted! [in Hindi] But you... you have betrayed me. Henceforth, no special fuel for you. You'll get the regular one! [Raju pants] [Raju tuts] [door closes] [Lakshmi in Hindi] Oh, Raju! Why are you late? [in Hindi] Mrs. D'Souza had to buy some vegetables... and on the way back Rani let me down. [Lakshmi in Hindi] What? [in Marathi] Have you gone mad? [in Hindi] You've never helped me get some vegetables! [in Hindi] I know these high profile old women very well. [in Hindi] First they seduce young men and then… [gasps] [in Hindi] Just stay away from her! [Raju in Marathi] Mom! [in Hindi] Am I Brad Pitt? [in Hindi] Get some sleep. [in Hindi] I'm very tried. [in Hindi] Okay? Good night. [Lakshmi in Hindi] Who is this Bird Pit? [in Hindi] You do wear the uniform, right? [in Hindi] No. [sniffles] I carry it in my bag. [in Hindi] Why? [in Hindi] Why should I? To show everyone... “Look! Here's the liftboy!" [tuts] [in Hindi] I've been... wearing that uniform for 30 years. [sighs] [in Hindi] You're not an engineer. [Krishna in Hindi] Are you? [in Hindi] Are you an engineer? [in Hindi] Where is your degree? [in Hindi] You have been trying to clear... one subject for the past two years. [in Hindi] Look at Shankar's son... he completed his MBA in two years and now he owns a house! [in Hindi] And you? when will you become an engineer? [in Hindi] When will we get out of that chawl? [in Hindi] When will your mother stop working as a maid? We might, once you're done with your pizzas and burgers. [in Hindi] Stay calm. [in Hindi] It'll affect your blood pressure. [in Hindi] Wait and watch... I'll get you and mom a bigger apartment than that of Shankar's son. Hm... [in Hindi] let's see. [in Hindi] I have all the time in the world. [slurping] [lift beeps] Fancy seeing you here on a Sunday. Ma'am... I came to collect my clothes and my briefcase, thought might as well collect my book. You kept it in your bag yesterday. Can I give it to you tomorrow? I'm heading for church and then to meet D'Souza. Mr. D'Souza? Yes! [Mrs. D'Souza] So... what are your plans for today? Nothing much. Just got back from the hospital. How's Krishna? Getting better. Good. I'll be visiting him tomorrow. Why don't you come to church with me? -Church? -[Mrs. D'Souza] Yes! [laughs] Ma'am, I've never been to a church before. I don't even know what to do there. And besides, I'm not even a Christian. House of God is open to all. And you know what they say... a person who goes to church for the first time... gets whatever he wishes for. I hope this is true. Lot of things to wish for. [rickshaw starts] [Mrs. D'Souza] So, what did you wish for? I wished for a penthouse in Bandra right next to Shah Rukh Khan's house. [both chuckle] And how do you think you're going to get that? I don't know, that's his problem, not mine. Would you like to meet Colin? [birds chirping] [door opens] [in Hindi] Raju, where were you the entire day? You didn't even come home for lunch! [in Hindi] I had gone to church with Mrs. D'Souza. [in Hindi] What? You've started going to church? Didn't I tell you to stay away from her? [Raju tuts] [in Hindi] But, Mom! She is older than you! [in Hindi] Yes, Raju… you're the only one who knows everything, right? What would a maid know? She doesn't have a brain, does she? I don't want to hear a word! Stop spending time with her or come work with me. [in Hindi] Mom! [in Hindi] I'm a liftboy... not a maid! And I'm an engineer as well. [in Marathi] See... an Engineer is here... a liftboy is here... and scrubbing vessels is here! [in Marathi] I am here. [in Marathi] Get it? [in Hindi] And stop worrying. Just make your son a cup of tea. Hmph! [lift beeps] [lift closes] [sighs] -[lift beeps] -[in Hindi] Liftboy, take these bags down. [Raju] Yes, ma'am. [lift beeps] [car hatch clicks] [lift beeps] [car door opens] [car door shuts] [Mrs. Kapoor in Hindi] Listen! [in Hindi] Take this. Thank you, Madam. [Mrs. Kapoor] Hello! [in Hindi] Don't thank me. [in Hindi] Just give it to Princess. [Mrs. Kapoor in Hindi] And listen... [in Hindi] Now you can thank me. [in Hindi] Let's go, driver. -Thank you, Madam. -[car starts] [door lock clicks] Hi! Hi! Um, your mom asked me to give this to you. Oh, thanks! So, what do you do in the lift all day? I press buttons. Don't you get bored? Yeah, I do. But I read to kill time Newspaper? Novels. Coffee? Duty. I have a really good book collection. Yeah but my buttons are missing me. Okay. Uh... why don't you come and hang out with me in the lift? In the lift? [laughs] Okay. Cool. [door closes] [Princess] Do you have a girlfriend? No. Boyfriend? What? No? [chuckles] You? Yeah. [clicks tongue] Kind of. What's "kind of"? You either have one or you don't. Do you love him? I don't know. I mean it's-- It's convenient you know. He's just there. Do you watch films? [clicks tongue] Yeah. What do you think of movie stars? [inhales deeply] I think they are overpaid, over-idolized. My mom wants me to be a movie star. What do you want to be? I want to be free. I want to be like a normal 18-year-old girl. You know, go to college, bunk lectures, go for movies with her friends, make out in the library. [chuckles] What's stopping you? My mom. Why? My mom was a supermodel in the 80s. And she tried really hard to become an actress but she never succeeded. Then she got married and that was the end of her modeling career. And now she's trying to fulfill all her dreams through me. Literally since the day I was born she was making me act in TV commercials, and photo shoots, and TV serials, and films and-- [tuts] [sighs] You know when I was four years old... she made me miss my first ever annual exam... to act in a toothpaste commercial. [both chuckle] Can you believe that? You know when... I was four years old... I used to go with my mom to work... which was washing utensils and... [in Hindi] sweeping and swabbing in different houses. I think your childhood was way better than mine. [chuckles] I wouldn't bet on that. [chuckles] So, tell me something... is Princess your real name? [tuts] If I told you... I'd have to kill you. -You can trust me. -[laughs] Good night, Mrs. D'Souza! Someone seems very cheerful today. I had a splendid day at work. In the lift? [chuckles] Interesting. I'll see you tomorrow [slurping] -[sighs] -[door opens] [in Hindi] Dad! Hm! [chuckles] Liftboy! [in Hindi] How are you? [in Hindi] When did you allow you to come home? [in Hindi] This afternoon! [in Marathi] Anyway how are you doing? Good. [in Hindi] I'll start working from the day after tomorrow. [in Hindi] You focus on your exam. [in Hindi] Okay? -[sighs] -[in Hindi] Dad... -you should rest. -[slurping] We'll talk when you're fit. Alright? [in Hindi] And what about your engineering? [in Hindi] I'll study in the lift. You take rest. [Lakshmi in Hindi] Raju is right but tell him to stay away from Mrs. D'Souza. She has cast a spell on him. [Krishna in Hindi] What? [in Hindi] Nothing, Dad. Have your soup. [in Hindi] Mom! Stop this nonsense! [in Hindi] Okay. That's enough. -Raju... -Hm? what was your mom talking about? [tuts] [in Hindi] Nothing, Dad. [in Hindi] Have your soup. [in Marathi] God knows what's going on… [crickets chirping] -[Lakshmi in Marathi] Listen... -[in Hindi] Yeah? I'm going to sleep. [in Marathi] Okay. [clears throat] [Lakshmi sighs] [Raju humming] [Lakshmi in Marathi] God! [Raju continues humming] [Lakshmi in Marathi] Oh, God! [Lakshmi groans] [Lakshmi sighs] [Raju continues humming] [in Hindi] Dad? [in Marathi] Yes, turn it off. -[Raju] Goodnight, Dad. -[fan clatters] [fan whooshes] [switch clicks] Raju... Raju! [in Marathi] Wake up. [in Marathi] What is it? [in Marathi] Sit. [groans] [sighs] [sighs] [Krishna] Raju... do you like this job? [in Hindi] It's great. There is no tension as such. [Krishna inhales deeply] [Krishna in Hindi] I... did this job for years... so that you wouldn't have to do it. [in Hindi] Nowadays, you listen to me. [in Hindi] You take care of your mother. [in Hindi] You have started taking responsibilities. It's good. [in Hindi] But you're an engineer... not a liftboy. [in Hindi] Be an engineer... not a liftboy. [in Hindi] But Dad... why did you do this job for so many years? Why didn't you do something else? [in Hindi] Because, son... I am indebted to Mrs. D'Souza. She has paid for your education all along. Do you think I could afford to send you to an English school and a college? You know how expensive your college is, right? I couldn't afford it even if I sold this house. When you were four... I was thinking of enrolling you in a municipal school. That's when Mrs. D'Souza said... “Krishna... enroll him in a Catholic school. Don't worry about his fees. I'll take care of it. Don't compromise with his education." She got you enrolled in that school. Every year... right from your school until your college... I showed her a picture of you and your report card. So that she doesn't feel that her money is being wasted. [sighs] [in Hindi] Does Mom know about it? [in Hindi] No. Are you crazy? Do you think your mother will accept this charity? You know her, right? [in Hindi] Why didn't you tell me? [in Hindi] I didn't think it was necessary. But... now you've learnt to be responsible. You've matured. So, I thought you should know. Hey... don't think about this. You... just focus on your studies. Hmm? Good night. [rain splashes] [in Hindi] Hey, kid! [in Hindi] Don't you go to school? [in Hindi] Will you pay for it? Idiot. Enjoy the tea. It's nice and strong. It will open your eyes and your mind. [in Hindi] How much? [in Hindi] 12 rupees. [in Hindi] Keep the change. [in Hindi] Thank you, sir. [gloomy music plays] [birds chirping] [security guard snores] [snores] [doorbell rings] [door lock clicks] [Mrs. D'Souza] Raju... you're very early today. Is everything alright? Everything's fine. Papa got back home last night. Yes, I got an update from the hospital. He was coming here today but I asked him to rest for a while. Very considerate of you. Uh... why don't you come and have a cup of tea? [Raju] No, thank you, ma'am. I just had tea on my way. Okay. [keys jingle] [door closes] [cell phone rings] [Raju] Shawn! [Shawn] Bro! What's up? I am good Bro. How are you? [Shawn] Bro, I just got back from London, man. It was pretty hectic. I think I may have lost a kilo or two. But, uh, let's meet today Yeah, bro. I'm at work right now, we can meet after that? [Shawn] Work? Congrats man! You didn't tell me bro. Where are you working? Uh, bro, uh… in a lift [Shawn] Good stuff, bro, good stuff. Lift engineer, which company? Galaxy... [Shawn] Galaxy? [Raju] Shawn... listen, bro, uh... I'll talk to you when I meet [Shawn] Okay bro! 7:30, same place. Okay, alright, bye! [clears throat] Shawn! [Shawn] Where the hell have you been? Sorry, bro, I got late. Don't be sorry, be jolly. Have a Johnny. Here, have a double instead. So, what the hell have you been up to? You got a job and you didn't even tell me about it. You know what, I'm not paying for any of this man, this treat is on you. Um... Bro, I work as a liftboy. Liftboy? Dude, I press buttons in a lift. You're kidding, right? No man. My father used to work there, he had a heart attack. I'm just filling in for some time. I'm so sorry to hear about your dad, bro. Is everything okay now? Everything is fine. He just needs rest. Wait a second, it all makes sense now. Remember when I asked you why your dad wears a uniform to work, you told me he's working undercover for the Mumbai Police [laughs] Yeah. And then this one time, your bike got stolen and you came running to my house to tell my father about it and my father is wondering -“Why is this boy talking to me -[laughs] about his stolen bike?” [laughs] Cheers, man! [glasses clink] That is crazy. You made me a fool quite a few times all these years. [both chuckle] You know sometimes I just wonder, how did you clear engineering and I haven't? What the hell is this? This is the answer to all your questions, my good old amigo. You know I used to take some pills. These are those pills. How do you think my memory is so sharp, huh? Elephant's brain! [mumbles] Hm and elephant's body. -[Shawn] What? -Uh... where did you get this from? So, you know I used to jerk off to ease my tension before exams, right? So, this one time before DSP paper, I'm watching Jenna Jameson and playing my flute when all of a sudden, this add pops up that says I can increase my performance for a $1.99. I knew that was exactly what I wanted. So, I grabbed the offer with both hands. [chuckles] Great, bro. [Shawn] Hey what are you doing? Keep it. There's plenty of stalk back home Uh, no thanks, I think I'm good Dude, I insist. I'm telling you... keep it, you'll thank me, you'll thank me, you'll say “Shawn, bless the day you were born” and kiss my hand, here, kiss my hand. Shawn, do you listen to yourself? Yeah, man! All the time. Hm... Come here... are you still a virgin? Yup. [Shawn] That's sad, man! You need to live a little, man. Take some tips from the master! I'm actually waiting for the love of my life. [coughs, gags] [coughs] [Shawn] Dude... I have found the love of my life six times, okay? Six times! I have felt more love in a dance bar, man. Six times? [Shawn] Yeah. See, Sheena and I, it was completely virtual. Navroze, she fell for her cousin. Shivani, she ran away with a Caucasian. Okay? Sudha said no sex before marriage, and Salma, Salma was the best! Salma wanted me to get circumcised! Really? [Shawn] Yeah, man. She wanted me to take off my Raymonds and be an incomplete man! Bro, that's just sick! It is disgusting, dude. Imagine riding without a helmet man. -[chuckles] -[Shawn] That's just dangerous. Anyway, man. Let's not talk about that. -Cheers! -Yeah, cheers! It is so good to be back, I've missed you dude! Same here. [cricket chirping] [door opens] [Raju in Hindi] Dad… you haven't slept yet? [Krishna in Hindi] At 02:30 am, my son... stumbles into the house drunk... and asks me why I haven't slept yet? [in Hindi] I will, if you let me sleep peacefully! [in Hindi] Yesterday we had a discussion about your career and today you... come home like this! [in Hindi] Aren't you ashamed? [in Hindi] If wanted was to press lift buttons all your life... why did waste Mrs. D'Souza's money? [Krishna in Hindi] Why did you give us the false hope of you becoming an engineer? [sighs] [tuts] Who were you with? Shawn. Shawn. [in Hindi] Learn something from him! [in Hindi] He's an engineer, he earns well, he's happy, his parents are happy! And you? [in Hindi] Dad, he is not happy. [in Hindi] There is no job satisfaction! Job satisfaction? [in Hindi] What is that? Ask someone who doesn't have a job. Ask one who is dying of hunger. Job doesn't give you satisfaction... job gives you food for your belly, clothes for your body, earns you respect and gives your parents a break from their hectic lives. [Krishna sighs] Job satisfaction. [in Hindi] It was my fault… I shouldn't have sent you there. [in Hindi] I'll join my duty tomorrow. [in Hindi] But, Dad-- [in Hindi] Enough! That's enough! You will stay at home, study… and become an engineer. Just become an engineer. I don't wish to hear anything else! [birds chirping] [doorbell rings] [door opens] Krishna! Good morning, Madam! What a pleasant surprise! But what are you doing here? Where's Raju? Raju... ma'am... idiot boy! [Krishna] I come now. What happened? [tuts] [in Hindi] Uh... I mean... [Krishna sighs] Come in. Come. [sighs] What say, ma'am... Raju... night... 02:30... [in Hindi] drunk! [in Marathi] I made him sit, I talked to him... Uh, uh, sorry... I make him sit. And tell him... [in Hindi] son... Ma'am gave money for study. But you no responsibility! Failing. Failing. One time... two time. [tuts] Okay. Raju fail four time! [in Marathi] That is when I said, "Enough!" Study! [in Hindi] And clear your test! [Mrs. D'Souza] But what makes you think he's going to clear it this time? I mean what is he doing different from other times? [stammers] [in Marathi] I asked him to take the test until he doesn't clear it! 15 times! 20 times! Give! [in Marathi] But pass the test! And what paper is this? [tuts] [in Marathi] Some... drawing. Dera-- Oh, you mean drawing. Hm! Drawing! [in Marathi] He is an engineer, right? So, it's engineering drawing. Engineering drawing… Hm... [slurping] [sighs] Krishna... Hm? ...you go home and send him to work. Leave the rest to me [in Marathi] But Ma'am... No "buts", Krishna. I'll handle it. Take care, Krishna. [inhales deeply] [Mrs. D'Souza] Mishra... [Guard in Hindi] Yes, ma'am? Give these keys to Raju, they're the lift keys. [in Hindi] Okay. [in Hindi] Dad? [in Hindi] You didn't go to work? [in Hindi] Why should I go? [in Hindi] the doctor has asked me to rest and drink soup. [in Hindi] Lakshmi, where is my soup? [in Hindi] What? Oh! Shit! [Mrs. D'Souza] Did Raju come? [in Hindi] No, ma'am. [doorbell rings] [door opens] [Raju] Sorry, ma'am! I sort of went out last night and-- [Mrs. D'Souza] You are extremely late, Raju! Your father has worked here for 30 years! And not a single day has he reported late for work! I'm sorry, ma'am. Just because I treat you like my own son, doesn't mean you take advantage of that. I could fire you now if I wanted to. But I am not going to... because of the respect I have your father. Take the keys... and get to work. I'm sorry, ma'am. Won't happen again. It better not! [door slams shut] [sniffles] [lift beeps] Raju? [Raju] Ma'am, I came late today. Hence, thought of making up for it. Don't do all this drama. Come home, I want to talk to you. [lift closes] Your father came home today. Raju he is extremely worried about you not clearing your drawing exam. Why aren't you being able to do that? Bad luck, ma'am. Sheer bad luck. My preparation has always been 100 percent. [Raju tuts] [Raju] But bad luck. But this time, I am doing a lot of good karma, by doing my father's job, hopefully God will be kind to me this time. What is it you're doing this time... that you haven't done in the previous four attempts? Ma'am, I'm very positive I'll clear my exam this time. I don't know how, but I'm sure I will. But I'm sure, I will. Raju... I'll teach you. [Raju] Ma'am... this is engineering drawing. It's not like your painting. [Raju] It's very difficult, there are a lot of rules you need to follow. Leave that to me. Tomorrow onwards, after your shift, you come here and we'll do your lessons together. You can have your dinner here. [Raju] Ma'am, I'm sorry, but I don't think that will be possible. [Raju] My father won't let me trouble you this way. Oh, you think so? Let me call him. It's okay, I'll go home and ask him. No, no, it's okay. [Mrs. D'Souza] Krishna… [door opens] [in Hindi] Why did you tell her? Huh? [in Hindi] Why did you tell her? [in Hindi] Do you like telling everybody that your son has failed? [in Hindi] Have you told mom? [in Hindi] Mom! [in Hindi] Mom! [in Hindi] Mom! [Lakshmi in Hindi] What do you want? Let me sleep! [in Hindi] Don't drag me into this father-son conflict. [Raju in Hindi] What? [in Hindi] But you told me... about these high-profile old women, young lads, seducing and stuff! [in Hindi] And Dad is sending me to her place. [in Hindi] What happened, Mom? [in Hindi] Don't you care about your son? [Lakshmi in Hindi] Let me sleep! [in Hindi] Dad... she has asked me to have dinner there. You know I don't like eating out! [in Hindi] You can have your dinner after you come home. [in Hindi] Yes, Dad... I'll do that. I'll go there, come back, eat and go again. What about studies? Should I waste time or should I study? Huh? Do you want me to fail? [in Hindi] I've seen you study. [in Hindi] Let's try something new this time [in Hindi] Come on, Dad! [in Hindi] You don't understand anything! [in Hindi] What do I not understand? [in Hindi] Have you even touched your book these days? [in Hindi] Have you studied for a minute? [in Hindi] You try to understand, son. Ma'am is trying to help you out. [in Hindi] She is feeding you. [in Hindi] You know how much she has done for you. [sighs] [Krishna] Raju... [in Hindi] Do you have your drawing apparatus with you? [Krishna sighs, coughs] [in Marathi] Yes, Dad. [in Marathi] Hey, Raju! Best of luck! [in Marathi] You will definitely pass the test this time! [door opens] -[Mrs. D'Souza] Good morning! -Good morning! Good Lord! So many things! [Raju] I told you, it's not like your painting. Anyway, I've brought all of this now. You please feel free to have a look and in case it doesn't work out, I can always take it back in the night [lift beeps] -Hi! -Hi! [lift closes] [Raju] How's acting? Ugh! Not so good. I've decided I'm going to stop going for all these Bollywood parties, I'm done! [Raju] And your mother? [Princess] Yeah, I just told her she should go with my photo album instead. [chuckles] Anyway, how's engineering? [Raju] Mrs. D'Souza is gonna be helping me clear my paper this time. She's an engineer? No! No ways! [sighs] But she seems to think she can help. [tuts] Let's see. Anyway, I'll be in the building from morning to night for the next couple of days. Nice! I'll text you before leaving, see if you can, maybe, come out for a while, Cool! Ping me on WhatsApp. [Mrs. D'Souza] So we will begin with the first chapter, intersection. You take a solid. When you pass another solid through it... it creates a hole. Now how that hole appears in this solid is basically intersection. Okay, let me see if I can make it easier for you. [sighs] Yeah. Now this is one solid, I'm passing another solid through this. So, this point is basically an intersection. Now what we need to do is make an orthographic projection on this of this solid. Okay, ma'am. Done. It's time for me to leave. We've done a lot on the very first day. [chuckles] You've just about started. Now you do your sums and I'll go cook some dinner Really? You must be tired. We can call it a day. No excuse, Raju. Four sums. [tuts] [sighs] Mrs. D'Souza... you're really good at this. You will be too. I have a plan that we need to follow. Wow! Thank you! I've made two copies, you can have one Okay, time's up! Back to work now! But I'm still eating. I know. You have two more minutes, finish up. [door opens] [yawns] Ma'am... I don't think I've ever done so much drawing in my entire life! I know. You have a lot of potential. You're just lazy. Good work done today. I'll see you tomorrow [sighs] [groans] [in Hindi] Shoes! [in Hindi] Yes, Dad! [upbeat music playing] [in Hindi] How are you? [in Hindi] Fine. [groans] Yeah. Yeah. Are you still with your boyfriend? Nope! [Cyrus yelps, grunts] Stand here. Stand here. Don't be scared. [yelps, groans] Are you-- Are you okay? [in Hindi] Fifth floor. [inhales deeply] [sighs] [in Hindi] I wish all the customers were like Mrs. Kapoor. [in Hindi] I would've celebrated Eid every day. Development. So, when you have a solid... and you have a hole in it... and, uh, you open it... how would it look? I don't know why would anybody want to open such an object. [chuckles] Raju, focus. We can have your wisecracks after the exams. Try it. How is it? Love it! Ma'am... [Mrs. D'Souza] Mm-hmm? Can I ask you something? [Mrs. D'Souza] Sure. Do you have a dream? [Raju] As in... something that you wanted to achieve in your life? I always wanted to have children. But that didn't happen. [Mrs. D'Souza] Something I want to achieve… [groans] I'd like to make a masterpiece you know. A painting I'd be remembered for. Nice. Are you working on that? I was... before I realized I had to do that drawing exam. [lift beeps] Liftboy! [laughs] Where are you? [chuckles] Don't ask. I have been drawing all day, so much that I also draw in my dreams! -Wow, that's intense. -[sighs] How are you? Same old. I might be doing Farhan Akhtar's next film. Really? I thought you didn't want to be an actor. I don't. I don't even know how my mom convinced these guys. But I have to do it. If I don't do it, she will drive me up the wall for the rest of my life. [tuts] I want to do something worthwhile with my life, like... I want to live for a cause, you know. You could do that in your free time. Especially, if you're rich and famous. These causes don't pay. Maybe. [lift beeps] Oh... hello, Princess! Hi, Mrs. D'Souza! [Mrs. D'Souza] Raju... I thought you were supposed to be revising while doing your shift. I am, ma'am. Without any books? Great! I think you're doing a great job with his drawing lessons. I think he'll finally clear this time. [Mrs. D'Souza] I hope so too! You've become so skinny. Start eating. You're not my nanny anymore, no? So, no one's feeding me now. Why don't you come for dinner tonight? Our beloved liftboy will also be there. I would love to. But my mom's dragging me to another Bollywood party tonight. Oh, I pity you, my dear! Let's all grab a pizza after Raju clears his exams. Sounds like a plan. I'm game! Take care, my dear. See you at sharp seven. [chuckles] [Raju] I hope I pass. Or else, I'll be a liftboy forever. Don't worry. You'll pass! Ma'am... Hm? What if... after all these preparations... I still don't clear? Then we shall re-prepare and give it another shot. Just focus on being as prepared as you can be. And give it your best. Don't think about the outcome. Thank you, ma'am! That's very reassuring! Let's hope I get lucky this time. So, what are you planning to do after your engineering? Uh... I think I'm going to teach Engineering drawing to other students. [laughs] No that actually happens, you know. People end up giving engineering exams so many times that they ultimately start teaching it. [both chuckle] [door opens] Good morning. Have you been up all night? Yes, ma'am. I was doing sums till 04:00 a.m. You could've done them here. [Raju] Yeah, but I was really enjoying it. Now that's a compliment. Here are the keys. Have a nice day and I'll see you in the evening. Good day! Now we have two more topics to cover. And then you can start solving your examination papers. I think I'm going to ask Krishna to replace you till you complete your exams. We have only 16 days to go. [Krishna in Hindi] Lakshmi, is my uniform ready? [in Hindi] Yes, Dad. [in Marathi] Hey, Krishna! where's father-son duo headed? [Raju in Marathi] To work! [in Marathi] I'm headed to work, he's going to study! -[in Marathi] Nice! -[in Marathi] Let's go! You remember you told me about that painting that you always wanted to do? Hm, yeah. Is it complete? I just started. Can I see it? Not today, Raju! It's work is in progress. You can see it after your drawing exam is over. It will be complete by then. What's it about? Hope. That's too abstract! So is life, Raju. So is life [door opens] [Krishna] Good evening, madam! Good evening, Krishna! [in Marathi] What is this? [in Hindi] Is he studying or sleeping? He's been studying all this while. Just taking a little nap. [in Marathi] Oh, okay… Thank you, madam. [in Hindi] for the first time in his life, he's studying this hard. [in Hindi] Otherwise, um, he is lazy. Very lazy! [in Hindi] You, ma'am… [Mrs. D'Souza] Don't be silly, Krishna. Let him clear his exam and get a good job. We both knew he never belonged here. That is one thing we always worked towards... to see him in a better place. [door closes] [cell phone rings] Shawn! [Shawn] Bro, where are you? Same old buddy, studying for my fifth re-sit. What news? [Shawn] Listen, you have to meet me, I have something for you Just two days to go for my exams, buddy, can we do this later? [Shawn] Just meet me for an hour. This is important! [sighs] Okay. Same place, 07:30. [Shawn] Sure man, I'll see you there. Bro... Zenia dumped me. You called me during my exam preparation for this? I had started saving money for our marriage, man. Oh, man. I'm really sorry! But at least you're used to these things by now. Raju... thank God you are not a shrink, man. Anyway, how's your preparation coming? [Raju] I've been working really hard, man. So much that I get isometric and development in my dreams. You'll clear this time, right? I hope so. You can't really predict these things. Can't predict anything, man! This beer tastes like piss, dude! Or rather, it tastes like life! Because life is also one big bucket of piss, you don't know where it fucking gets dumped out on the streets. You know what I'm saying? Like, anyone can just walk over and kick it over and then like get out onto the street and your life sucks. So anyway, coming back to my point. You're my brother, right? Shawn, have you been smoking up during the day? [tuts] No man, answer the question. Are you my brother? [Raju] Yeah. And you know I love you right? [tuts] Bro, I love you too man. Can we get to the point? Well, let's just say I am a magician and I have a rabbit in my pants. Hat, bro. Yeah, yeah, I have a hat too. And using that, I have found this guy who'll help you clear your drawing exam. What? Who? From where? How does it matter? There's this guy, there's this professor who'll clear your drawing exam for 60,000 bucks. 60K? And where am I supposed to get that money from? Raju, how predictable of you man! In spite of me telling you the whole story you want to know the beginning again. Didn't I say I was saving up for my wedding? Yeah? I am going to give that money to you man. [tuts] Pay me back whenever you can or don't pay me back. I-- I don't care [Shawn] What? Don't know buddy Look, I'm going to ask you for the money back, alright? I know bro, but I don't know if I want to clear it this way. [sighs] Look Raju, don't get all scent of a woman on me! I am sick and I'm tired of seeing you fail. What we're going to do is we're going to go this guy, and he's going to clear your paper, you're going to give that exam, get that piece of paper and then I have already spoken to my HR about a position for you. Just clear this thing, dude! and we'll be working together in no time. We'll be like, like, Harvey Specter and Mike Ross. We can work in the same office. I'm Harvey by the way. [chuckles] Okay, bro. Let me go home and ask my parents. That's cool, man. Just let me know. I've got your back, chill, I'm here for you. [in Hindi] Sixty thousand. [in Hindi] How am I gonna get it? [sighs] [in Hindi] You've seen how hard he has been studying this time. [in Hindi] What if he still doesn't pass the test? [tuts, sighs] [in Hindi] Lakshmi, I understand that this is his fifth attempt... but what is the guarantee that he will pass. I mean... does the professor guarantee that he'll pass the test? [Raju in Hindi] He's Shawn's reliable contact. [in Hindi] He says that he has helped many students pass the test. [sighs] [in Hindi] Okay... your mother has some jewelry... we can sell it and get some money. Ask her. [Lakshmi] Uh... [in Hindi] Yes, I'm ready. [in Hindi] Raju, tell me one thing… what have you done differently this time? Mrs. D'Souza... You shouldn't be doing this. I can guarantee you'll score more than 65 this time. But, ma'am... even if you add all my marks in the past four attempts, it won't be 65. Raju, trust me. I know what I'm talking about. Including today, you have two more days. Just revise. Don't waste your time in all this. I have said what I feel is right. Now you make a choice and decide what's best for you. Bro, are you sure? [Raju] Yes, bro. But thank you so much for all the support and all that. Bro, listen, don't get all sentimental on me okay? Remember man, focus, eye of the tiger! Eye of the tiger! [Shawn] Okay? And another thing... you have those performance pills? Remember, take three before the day of the exam and five on the day of the exam. Okay? Five! Listen, you got enough stock? Yeah, bro. I have enough for me to last for another three more attempts [laughs] Sense of humor. I love it, I love it! You know what man, go in there, do your best, kill it man. Listen, if you need anything, don't hesitate to call, okay? [Shawn] Just ace this thing. [Shawn] Bye, man! [tuts] See you. Ma'am... Hm? Can I ask you something? Go for it. Why me? You've been so selfless... so kind to me. After all... I'm just a liftman's son. No, Raju. You're much more than that. Twenty years ago… [sighs] [Mrs. D'Souza] You know, Raju... it's not about the destination. It's always about the journey. I mean, just see, if you didn't have a drawing re-sit, we could have never spent so much time together. I'm so glad that we did. After Colin passed away... I was really lonely. I had nothing to look forward to. Thank you for this, Raju Ma'am... thank you. God bless you! Do well! [birds chirping] [Raju in Hindi] Lord, please! Four times is a lot! Please help me this time. I don't want to create a record. Please help me pass this test. [Raju in Hindi] Hello, Dad... the exam went really well. This time I'll definitely pass! [Krishna in Marathi] Nice! Listen, I am going to meet Ma'am. [Krishna in Hindi] Come home... we'll go see her together. [in Marathi] Okay. Hm! -[Krishna] Raju... -Hm? [in Hindi] come and sit here. [in Hindi] Is it urgent? [in Hindi] I'll meet Mrs. D'Souza and come back. Okay? [in Hindi] She passed away this morning... in her sleep. [in Hindi] But... she had promised that after the exam-- How is this possible? [in Hindi] The body is in the hospital. [sad music] [sniffles] [sobs] [sniffles] [sniffles] Raju... [in Hindi] we must perform her last rites. We are all she had. But I don't know... the Christian rituals. [sniffles] [birds chirping] [birds chirping] [birds chirping] [in Marathi] Take care. [in Marathi] Good day, Mom! [door knob rattles] [door closes] [exhales deeply] [lift beeps] Good morning, sir! [in Marathi] Come on, Dad! [chuckles] [lift beeps] Good day, liftboy! [in Marathi] Good day, Dad!
