The water is warm, nails You just woke up, Pirin? -Tek, Lapo Etek chicken (released; Pariaman) Tech -What did you say !? You say I'm lazy (greedy; payakumbuh). Are you asking for a fight? Stand you up! For me the enemy is not sought after meeting abstinence What is this? What is wrong? This is Mak, He said I am lazy (Greedy; Payakumbuh) How am I not angry. Calm down ... Calm down ...

I see Etek Lis Chicken Lapeh (released; Pariaman). I said to Etek, "Tek tek etek lapeh tek" Eeehh, he's angry with me. How am I not angry? I spelled it out (Raklus; Payakumbuh). If Mak doesn't believe. Ask the Udin. Or the same as Tek Lih. He has no manners! -Really like that Lis? -I don't know it's been a fuss, Mak -Lopeh or Lapeh? -Lapeh. Lapeh that I heard, Mak? Obviously he called Lapeh. ooo ... Maybe this is what it means the chicken is lopeh (loose) from the tie, not saying the Pirin is meleh (greedy) Maybe it's because Pirin isn't healthy, so the champ is angry. Alright Mak, if I'm wrong, I'm sorry Well, if it's like this, calm down Where do you live? I work with Ajo Amaik Ooooh ... the goldsmith? Yes, Mak, I went to the market first, Mak.

Oiya, Mus, if it's finished, can you please deliver it immediately? Where is his house, Jo? Later you will go again to the Market. Just ask Sutan Datuak Bagindo - Everyone knows his name. -All right, Jo. Uni, hitch a question? Where is Sutan Bagindo house, Ni? Uh, Uda. Eh, Uni again. It turned out that Uni was really the place to ask. I was forced to ask again. What do you want to ask? Asking for Sutan Bagindo's house Oooo ... Sutan Datuak Bagindo House. You just follow this path. Later, turn left. His house is behind "Surau". Alright Ni. Oiya, if you can know what the name of Uni is? Ros, Da. Ondeh content. The top loved ulam arrived, yes, Uni. The well was dug up and came. Meet what you really want. Later that night the Union teaches recitation? Yes Ti, why is that? -Oh, yeah, Ni, excuse me, Ros. - Yes, Da -Ni, tomorrow morning accompany Siti to the market huh. -What are you doing to the market? -Amak told him to buy "Batiah", to be taken by Pak Angah to Padang. -Alright, if Union work isn't much, tomorrow Uni will accompany you. -Ti, please bring this to the kitchen. -All right, this. How are you, Mus, Bak? Since he left there hasn't been any news. I'm afraid something happened to Si Mus. He just left for a few days. There's no way he will immediately give us news. He's grown up, he's smarter than us. Leave it alone. Right, Bak. But he is our only child. -And our relatives aren't there. -Look at him there. You already know, your peers are already married. Yes, bro. But my feelings are not good. You don't have to worry too much. Sister, because it's late we go home. -Do not forget the Ad-dhuha letter that the Union taught earlier, please memorize it at home, huh Now we put the Qur'an back - Have you finished the recitation? -aaaaaah -Ros. -Eh, yeah. What's up, Uda? -This is, Siti first. Where are you going? Uni is only for a while. -There's Siti waiting for the Union -Here it's Siti, what are you doing there? No, da. Siti is just waiting there. Oya Ros, there's something for you Ros, I returned first. -Okay, Siti just came home first. Assalamualaikum - Waalaikum Salam -Ros, -Eh, yeah. Where did you know we were here? Yesterday, I overheard Siti asking to be accompanied to Ros Union, going to the market to buy "Batiah" Pak Angah. - Have you been standing there for a long time? -Not yet. Do you want to buy the market? Nothing, just looking around - Have you been a goldsmith? -Not yet. But if in Pariaman I did sell gold. How long have you been in Payakumbuh? Ajo Amaik said, 2 weeks to replace friends ... Eh Ajo Amaik employees who returned home -Wah, just a minute -What's the matter, all depends on Ajo Amaik Uda, Uni, Siti came home first? -Well, Siti's house from here? -No, it's near from here. -Okelah, be careful, bro -Yes Da -Be careful ya Ti -Iy Ni Oya Ros, the letter I gave has been read? Oiya ... Siti forgot to read what letter is that, Da? Actually there is something I want to convey but I was afraid to say it directly But because we've met, I have to say. Actually Uda wants to marry Ros Will Ros marry Uda? Da, Ros comes home first. It is not good with the villagers, it will be rumored to be a no-no. Assalamu'alaikum, Da Salam Salam -Assalamu'alaikum -Wa'alaikum Salam Ros, sit down for a while. There's something I want to talk about. What's the matter? Amak finds this letter under your bed. Because Amak's eyes were farsighted, it was rather difficult to read them But Amak is sure this is a letter from Amak's daughter-in-law. Why are you like someone who is so scared, kid? Amak understand, you're grown up it's time to be married And all your age friends are also married And again, in our family you are the only one who hopes to continue the line of our family Tek instead, his three children but all men. So, if it tastes suitable and indeed you like him it's okay, we just speed up One more, Amak always prayed, O God ...... take the time for my servant to carry his grandchild before he dies as soon as Amak's prayer. Your mamak if you know you already have a candidate surely they will be very happy to hear this news If Amak can tell what his name is, where does he work? Muslim, you are a goldsmith. Goldsmith? Where do you work? Near here, Mak Kerja with Ajo Amaik. Ajo and Ajo, who is a dancer? So, which Muslim is this person? Same with Ajo Amaik, Mak. Orang Pariaman too. What? Pariaman people ?! Is Amak not hearing wrong? Don't be stupid, Ros with the mariners ?! No, Ros! Better keep your intentions! It's better to find another one! Why, Mak? He is a good person, Mak. Even though Ros only knew him but he was a good person, Mak. Good ... well ... what's the good thing? The point is Amak does not agree with the Pariaman people Hear! Amak doesn't agree! Why, Mak? What's the problem with him? Not. I have no problem with him What do you know about the problem? our customs with his customs are the opposite. Ingati it! Like no other man just forget him! Amak! Ooo ... son listen to Amak Pay attention to the origin of the prospective husband that you will marry! Look at our situation, we are poor people Aren't you sorry, kid !? Don't you feel sorry for your mother's situation !? What are we going to pay for the Pariaman pickup for ?! Only one request, Amak! Please forget the Muslim! You hear?! Forget her! Amak! Has Ros eaten? Not yet, Uda. Maybe soon. Since I came home I didn't see him. Where is he going? He is there, but ... since then he didn't want to get out of his room. What is wrong with him? What is the problem? Look, Da This morning I found a letter under his bed I read apparently from someone who likes him. Then I ask? Who is he? "uda muslim, mak" where do you work? "He is a goldsmith, Mak," he said If indeed the person is already working, it's okay. Where does he work? Close from here For me it's okay, if indeed he likes it, he will also undergo it. Everything depends on Si Ros. But ......... there's a little problem, Da. It turns out that the Muslim ......... Pariaman people, Da Ha? Pariaman people? Am I not hearing wrong ?! The Ros doesn't think stupid! Does he think he has money to pick up the pariaman? Yes, I have already said that I have even angry at him. But he just kept quiet. I was afraid of being too rude to him -Maybe that's why he didn't come out of the room -No! Tell him what will happen if the Mamak-Mamak know? Yes, I also understand, Da. But there is something I think about. I am afraid that Ros will be determined to hang himself Our only child is the only one who will continue the descendants of our family Even the three children, but all men. Yes, Tini But with what we will pay for the shuttle We don't have money to repair a house. Yes, I understand. But, I just asked Uda not to be too hard on our child Only he is our only child, Da. We better just give up, Da We just give in. If what happens I'm afraid I can't bear to imagine it, Da. Uda! Uda! -Fast, Da. We will find out later. -Are ready, Ros? Hurry up, Da! -How's the condition of Ros, right? - Has he come out of his room? Already, Da This morning I saw he had come out. Maybe he wanted to perform a prayer for prayer But because it's dark, whether he sees me or not I don't know. But clearly he was out OK. I went first to the rice fields combing the embankments Seeing the water conditions. Okay, Da. -I go first. Assalamualaikum -wa'alaikum salam -Rooos ... Rooos -Yes, Mak Come here What's the matter? So, how is it? Do you really want to marry the pariaman child? Amak see, you want to marry him One more time before, Amak has never seen your attitude like this If yes, later that afternoon Amak will ask Mak In to meet the Muslim. Of course we will find out where the family lives first. How? Yes, Mak. Just stay here, Jo? -Yes Which yesterday, it was finished and delivered? Already, Jo -Assalamu'alaikum -Walaikum Salam, wait a minute. -Eh, Da In. Please enter Da In. -Yes, thank you Please sit down Da In What is the need, Da In? Do you want to gild gold? -No, I need to be with Ajo employees, the Muslim. Is he here? -Ooooh ... Muslim Wait a minute yes he still has a little work Okay, no problem Has Mus finished? -It's already, Jo. -Love for a while. Someone is looking for you. -Well, this is the Da in Muslim. -I, Mamak the Ros. Please sit down, Mus - I get water, huh. - Don't bother, Jo. I'm only for a while. What's the matter, sir? Look, I want to ask. Where is the address of Muslims in Pariaman Because tomorrow, we plan with Mamak the other Ros will go there. -What are you doing, sir? - Discuss your relationship. -How's the way to go, Jo? -Nothing, Mus The work here is almost done. Quickly finish, then go home Convey to Amak and Abak so that they can be delivered to the other Dunsanak OK, Jo ambitious candonyo lai kanduang gunuang singgalang oo ai ai it appears from the poor gunuang marapi it appears from the poor gunuang marapi kaba is confused when the deck is thrown away, go home do it ai ai Ros Mananti, who is sad and suko hearted kaba rancak yo raak dibaok come home oo ai ai Ros Mananti, who is sad and suko hearted -Where's Buyuang, Dar? -There, in the room. Yuuuuang -ooo yuaaang. -Yes, Bak. How was your trip? Thank God smoothly, Bak. Thankfully. -Radio Abak why does the crackle sound like that? -That's, sometimes the sound is really crackling. If I'm not mistaken, you're planning two weeks in Payakumbuh. Why are you home now? -Are Amaik's employees back? -No, Bak I have a need to go home, Bak Mak, Bak, someone will ask me he is a Payakumbuh person Tomorrow, his friends will come here "maantaan asok" -People of Payakumbuh. -Yes, Bak. How about it, Dar? Just now we both heard what our children said that tomorrow someone will come ask him Tell you what, tomorrow morning, go to the house of the mamak-mamak, say that there will be people who will come "maantaan asok ' Alright, Bak Tomorrow I will deliver it to the mamak-mamak of the Mus. -Who are you going to Pariaman tomorrow, right? -All mam Ros will all leave tomorrow. Ooooh ... come with everyone. Yes, Da. Mak Uncu has been told? Mak Uncu should have been told. But..... Who knows who will announce it in Padang. Hmmm ... I heard that Pirin will go to Padang tomorrow Meet him at the Lis Pagi shop, usually he is there. Did you even tell me? Not yet, Da. Tell you what, tomorrow if someone is going to go to Solok, leave a letter What do you think? Okay, Da. Later if you don't tell your sister he can be angry. -Yes too, my sister is that. -It is true Let Ros make the letter. -Where's the Ros? -Roooosss ... Yes, Mak. -Din ... -What? Tomorrow I want to go to Padang, I want to trade. I don't think I can live in this village like a chicken lost its mother. What do you want to sell in Padang? Later when I arrive in Padang, there must be something I can sell. What is clear is that I left first Good luck Actually you really don't fit in the village Working in the fields? You are lazy Carrying a hoe, you can't Actually this village person is also sick of seeing you, including me. But, Amak you, too dear, have you said goodbye to your amateurs? Later this missing child will disappear. I don't need to say goodbye Goodbye or not I'm the same Amakku. Means it's not important! Then you say, yes, whatever. -Oooo ... Pirin. -Eeee ... Mak Tini. What's the matter? - Don't hear you're going to the fields, right? Iyo, Mak. -Begini, amak want to leave a letter to Mak Sati -That's if Pirin wants to -Well, bro -Where's the letter, bro? -This. Pirin knows the address, Sati? -Pastilah, Mak. This is Pirin, Mak, not Udin. You arrogant -If so Amak comes home first. thanks. -Yes, Mak. You are welcome. -Be careful on the way, ok. -Thank you, Mak. Sis, let's go home. Ni, Roooos Uniii Uh, yeah Ti Why does the union's attitude change lately? Siti heard that the Union will marry Uda Muslim? Yes, Ti. This morning the mamak-mamak Uni had gone to the parade. Hopefully everything was smooth. But, the Union knows the customs of pariaman people with our customs are different. In Pariaman, the women must pay a shuttle for men After all, I was working as a goldsmith. It must have been a big sum of money - Has Uni thought carefully? -It's already, Ti but if the match is not going where. "Dima somak there, you were lunching in the afternoon" That's right, Ni. Look, Jo. Our arrival here intends to bring good news, wanted to pick up niece Ajo to be our son-in-law. Wayoik ... if that's the case. According to our custom, money is lost and there is a pickup But we don't use lost money, but we keep our pick up money. It is true but another other part of the fish, another is another grasshopper where the earth is grounded there the heavens are upheld We also have customs. So, "how come, please help, how come the pots please sit in the afternoon like a day, like a month" for us. -Where are you, Yuang? -New back from Surau, Bak All of you also ate ketupat at Tek Anis stall Bak, Mus wants to ask something -What? -Bak, why should the pickup be that big? If the problem is that Abak's pick up money can't interfere Let your Mamak explain But, Yuang ... For tradition ... impossible to remove we are reluctant to society Yes, Bak. Mus also understands in the tradition that Mus also does not want to eliminate tradition -But why should it be that much, Bak -Well, Yuang Then Abak won't block your soul mate. Because, if Abak is difficult Abak is afraid you will not get a mate Yes, Mus. And even Amak can only maintain our traditions Batul, Mak. But he also has traditions too. yes, Amak also heard. If it's not mistaken "Maisi sasuduik" Yes, Mak. Mus has also heard it. But actually ... Both traditions ... There is no harm ooooo ..... "Maisi Sasuduik" He will also use it later oooo .... Pick-up money Hopefully it can be additional capital later for you mus Yes, Bak But what Mus was afraid of, Mak Why should it be that big So how good now? As the saying goes "Round of water because of vessels, Bula said by consensus". The problem now is not a little money to pick up the Muslim. Where do we have to find the money. Have you asked Ros? is he really sure? Look, when you first knew ... Ros wanted to be with the Muslim ... I have forbidden. But he cried when I was angry. To the extent that he doesn't come out of his room except for prayer and to the kitchen After that, I often experience nightmares So I was afraid that things would go wrong to Ros while he is the only daughter who will continue our lineage Si Malah, all sons. That is true, and we all already know. The problem now is money to pick up the Muslim where are we looking for? If you leave it to me, you know how I am. Now as we gather, let's find the best way we will do it. I remembered something ......... What if we mortgaged our family's high heritage? Pawned? Don't talk about the pawning problem again! As long as you know, conditions that allow pawning in the Minangkabau "House of cataracts gadang" (broken gadang house) "Gih gadang ballooning" (Girls are old but not married) "Mayik tabujua indak bakapan" (There is no fee for organizing the body) plus one more "Mambangkik batang tarandam" for these things, it is only permissible to sell or pawn the inheritance In my opinion, Ros is still not too late to get married, the age is not much Have you told Mak Sati and Si Malah? I told you, but until now I have not heard from them. In my opinion, the Union should be discussed together How? Right, that's right. But, after that if we can get a consensus word This problem is not a low inheritance. It is not the result of purchasing our parents This is a matter of high inheritance. If possible, all of them participate in negotiations -If it's already clear. -Please drink first. -Oooo .... Ethek. -Is it din? Just arrived? -Have heard of Tech? -What news? I heard that Ros's family will pawn their inheritance. -What do you do with the inheritance? -I heard that. Yes, it doesn't matter if the inheritance is low. You're just noisy. - So I passed in front of their house, like that I heard - You, Din If the inheritance is low, it doesn't matter if your high inheritance is reasonable, you ask -Not as easy as it is to pawn high treasure. -What? To pawn a high treasure, if not for something urgent For something that will bring shame, never pawn it Clear? "Rumah gadang katirisan", "Mayik tabujua in tangah house", "Geeh gadang square balloon" - This is me. I-yes, like your Union, then "Mambangkik batang tarandam" It is only possible to pawn the inheritance. You are already a Mamak, but you just don't know -Kok is making fun of me? -Who else do I want to omelette? Stupid. How to take care of people's business. -Etek, have you heard about it yet? -What news? The news that Ros's family will pawn his high heritage -The child wants to get married. -Don't talk about other people. Like no other talk Really Tech, the Ros is going to marry a Pariaman person. The pickup is very large The money is not there but this Ros still wants the Pariaman people. The solution is to pawn the inheritance. That's what I heard Tech. "Gih gadang balaki" right indeed you can pawn the inheritance But the Ros isn't it too late to get married? True Tech. It can be resisted by our customs Not only Pariaman people who have customs. We also have customs How do you fight with adat? We also have a marriage custom. "Maisi sasuduik" Just ask the groom the pillow, the mattress is gold. If necessary, the couch is all of gold. Imagine how big, Tech Is that because there is a dispute with your traditional Mengert? For marriages, men are "picked up". For Payakumbuh people, the men must be "Maisi Sasusuik". Udaaaaa ... ooooo Da ... hahaha -Was you got word? -What news? Do you want to be married again? -Ah just joked. -You are like that, running around screaming, like being chased by the ghost of Aruaru. Gini da, the Tini wants to pawn his inheritance. He wants to marry his son The candidate for Ros's husband is Pariaman. He worked to sell gold with Amaik. -So it's picked up -If it's not picked up, it's not coming. It's actually Jelangkung. What do you mean by using the pick up, Da? The custom of Pariaman is indeed like that. You told Tini. the Tini used a shuttle for men and they carried out the custom "Sasuduik" for the bride. It's just fair. Tell the Tini. Do not want. Why did I tell him. if you don't want to say what are you doing about people's business? Just take care of our business After all, Tini has Mamak assalamualaikum assalamualaikum -Assalamualaikum -Waalaikum salam Uni in the kitchen. Ooooh ... it's uni in the kitchen Ndeeeh Uni, Where Amak and the Union? I said earlier, but no one answered. The Union does not know where Amak is and where Abak goes. -Uni, is it true that Amak and Abak will pawn the inheritance to pick up Uda Muslim? -Ha? Uni doesn't know -Where can you hear from? -Duuuh, Uni. The villagers are already talking about this. So Siti hurriedly came here. The pickup for Uda Muslim was very big, Ni? Uni also doesn't understand why is Siti asking the Union? If indeed the money is very large, the Uni also has a good request for the custom "maisi sasuduik" If possible, the bed, cot and blanket are made of gold. Uda Muslim is a goldsmith You are there, Ti. Uni is up to Amak and Abak. Union is said to not want Yes, it's up to Uni. Teeeeeek .. Oooooo Tech ... -Eh .. Udin, please come in. -Yes, Tech. -Begini, Tek. Did you get the news? -What news? Yesterday I passed in front of Tek Tini's house, he wanted to pawn the inheritance. Has the ethos known? - Pawn the inheritance? -Right. -What for pawning? -What I heard, he wants to marry Ros. -To marry Ros must pawn the inheritance? -Right -Etek doesn't know? -Not Nen ... I don't think, Tini wants to pawn her inheritance because she wants to marry her child to the Pariaman people. Let it go, Sis, if they want to pawn their inheritance, we know that they are poor families Why do we have to worry they also have ninik mamak who will finish. That is true. Just leave it. Did you really tell Mak Sati? How come he hasn't come here yet? Already. I have sent a letter through Pirin. He went to Padang yesterday. -Assalamualaikum -Waalaikumsalam .. Here it is, Mak Sati comes long. -Please sit down, Mak. I make a drink, bro. -No need. Smart, yeah, now? How dare you step over me? Am I not useful anymore? - Are you really smart? -What does Mamak mean? I hear you will pawn the inheritance to marry Ros. Why not tell me? Are you able to take care of everything? -Mmm ... like this, Mak. That's not the story. -You know? The inheritance is not only yours and your family! But this concerns our future all clear? Now you guys leave you too, just taking care of this can't. Can you solve this yourself? Calm down, Mak. From whom Mak can our story pawn? There is nothing at all, we intend to pawn. Moreover, this is a high heritage Not the purchase of our parents. We also understand that, Mak Calm down Mamak first. Drink first, please make water for Mak Sati, Tini Drink it first, Mak. Let me calm down Bagini Mak, the Ros has met with her future husband But her future husband is Pariaman, Mak Yes, you know yourself. Every time we find a mate for Ros, he always refuses But with this Pariaman person, he is dead, Mak. I fear only one, Mak -If things happen that are not desirable -So, why don't you tell? Sudaah ... I have sent a letter through Si Pirin But ... indeed, until now there has been no news from Pirin When it comes to mortgaging inheritance ... I really asked for it, Mak. If we can use it Because right now it's the condition "Geezer inflammation of the square" is that right, isn't it? Look, Tini. "Gadih inflammation of the square" girl who was very late married. If I think that Ros hasn't been in age, it's not too late Yes, Mamak is right But, I see he likes the Pariaman people Yesterday, Mamak-mam Ros had gone there To explain what we mean It turned out that the "panjapuik" money was too large for the person requested, Mak The one I'm afraid of, Mak. If something goes wrong with Ros Especially later I always got nightmares, Mak Already ... you don't trust dreams too much Now, we better find a way out If indeed the man he likes us cannot force the will -If it really does happen -I'm not sure, that's what we're afraid of Tell you what, when we go there When do we leave, In? For me, it's up to Mamak. When did Mamak have time? In my opinion, if this good thing is better accelerated, later, a bad thing will come But, if it's bad it's okay to slow down Hopefully the good comes When did you get a chance? Let's go Then, yes. So this is Jo. Before we apologized to Mak Ajo Because it didn't give the news before The purpose of our arrival this time is to discuss our previous meeting again About the amount of the pickup I think the amount is too big for us If it didn't pay off because we couldn't afford it We will run this custom, but we also have customs, Jo. "Maisi Sasuduik" But if this money problem becomes a barrier, it can actually be sinful "Adat is used new, cloth is worn out," the saying goes We will run Adat, but if we have this money problem ... we are asking for consideration How do you think, Ajo? This ... Ooooo Tin Yooo Daaa You want to go to the stall first Good, Da Don't go home too late, Da Assalamu'alaikum Wa'alaikum Salam Astaghfrullahaladzim Uni doesn't use me anymore? I am the younger brother of the Union. Si Ros wants to marry Uni doesn't tell me !? In fact, I know from other people, the Union wants to deal with inheritance Know Uni? Heritage is not the result of our parents That's a high heritage of the Union, don't go around -You have arrived? Just calm down so I can explain. Look ... -Eeeeeh ... stretching out I don't have a daughter Uni can be arbitrary I have no intention like that! This is just a misunderstanding between us Why is it customary that separates us, Uda? Do not work too hard, Ros Later Amak does not become a grandchild. Oiya, Sidi (degree from Pariaman) Amak and Abak, right? So, Mak. He said this afternoon it would be Ooooh ... Thank God. Oiya, Mak Tek So it came? You don't worry. He will surely come because he is the one who hopes you get a daughter Etekmu said, "If later Ros's child is born, then we become grandmothers?" Still far from Ros's house, Bak No. If I'm not mistaken we will arrive soon But, try to ask Ajo the Padati handyman Jo, is it still far from the house that Ros's son Tini is Jo? We ask him ... he just ignores Soon, in about 8 months we will soon have grandchildren, Bak Women ... men ... What do you want women to do? If I am up to God who will give -If you are a girl ... Use the "Sasuduik" money, Bak -Of course -If you are male, use Pickup? -Yes Which one do you choose? - Actually women or men are the same. For me, it's up to God to give.
