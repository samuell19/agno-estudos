Guidance is internal. 12, 11, 10, 9 ... ignition sequence started. 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0. All engines are running. Takeoff! Apollo 11 took off. Fuel and oxygen stable, pressure and power good. Altitude 6.5 kilometers. Speed 670 m / s. The data is good, all the systems are working. - You've been granted a descent. Houston, I'm a little hesitant. - Eagle, Houston, we're not getting any information. One more meter. We're raising dust. The engines are off. The eagle has landed. January 12, 2011 SATELLITE REPAIR MISSION What does he mean by "I'm missing the rain in Africa"? The words are:"I bless the rain in Africa". I'm sorry? No, they didn't. - Yes, they are. - That makes even less sense. I should know that. I sang it at my wedding. I must have missed it because I was lying on the podium. You can't dance or your life depends on it. - Do you know how to argue? Like an old married couple? - She's my working wife. Back to work, intern. I'm missing the rain in Africa ... Thank you for spending your honeymoon with us in space. It was either space or Italy. But there is no such thing in Italy. Oh, my God! What the hell is that? Oh, Brian! -Marcus! -Help! I'm losing my breath! Oh, Brian! Oh, no! Yeah. Fowler, come in. -Help! -Marcus! Hold on. Marcus, come in. Oh, Marcus. Marcus! Damn it! Oh, my God Come on! Come on. No! Marcus ... No. I'll take you home. Oh, my God SOLD OUT You may remember the satellite repair accident 18 months ago. Today's appeals court handed down a final verdict At the suit of a former astronaut Brian Harper v. NASA For unfair dismissal. We have a recording of an internal conversation where Harper claims the cause of the accident A mysterious technological anomaly. So that so- called swarm hit the shuttle? - Yes Oh, my God For the 50th time, he hit Mare Crisium. Commander Fowler, a passing meteor or a solar flare. Could they cause such a disorder? - As you know, I was unconscious ... - Yes or no. Could the solar flare be the cause of the interference you witnessed? Technically, it could be the cause Are you kidding me? I lost a friend upstairs! - Because of negligence! Harper was once celebrated for landing the shuttle Endeavor Despite the total breakdown of the electronics. Harper no longer has a right to appeal And now it's clear that the accident was the result of human error. Today's verdict concludes his very public disfavor. Sonny, do you have to watch it again? You know, grandma will be very glad to see you. Dad's not coming, is he? Your dad has a lot to worry about now. -I know. That's why we lost the house. Maybe he'll come see you on Thanksgiving. Would you like that? I don't want to move. I hate New Jersey! 10 YEARS LATER UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, IRVINE I'm sorry, sir. My mom always says, "Better to ask for forgiveness than ask permission." Oh, shit. Did I take red or blue? Please make it blue. - State Observatory of Chile. - Esteban? (-Yes?) Professor Arrowood here. You're checking in for the telescope, I see. -Yeah, I'm still tracking the moon's orbit. Would you send me the footage from last night? To that other mail, not to school. As always, sir. - No vacuum cleaners again! I have to go. (Hi. -Adios!) (Hello, gentlemen!) You're seven and a half minutes late. I have to report you. Hello. -Hi. -Here you go? Oh, my God I would like "Pastrami madness", and I'd also like to ask you, darling, Oh, my God what sauces do you serve with Pastrami? We have barbecue sauce, mustard with honey, ranch ... What the fuck ?! - What was the last one? One Madness arrives now. - We have a strict "no phone" rule. I'm going on a break. Hello? I am Dr. KC Houseman and I have perhaps the most important discovery in history. Connect me immediately with the director of NASA! Honey, I sell T-shirts and toys. I can connect you to customer service. Please wait Hello? Black, two sugars. - You're reading my mind. Thank you. Why are you awake so early? - I can ask you the same thing. Is everything okay?| -It will be. If I don't get to dinner, let Jimmy do his homework, take a bath ... You worry too much. I have everything under control. -Good. Talk to you soon. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER HOUSTON, TEXAS All right, not everyone out loud. The moon's orbit has shifted. I'm sorry?| -Its orbital radius is decreasing. That's not possible. - We thought so too, so we checked the calculation three times. Oh, my God The moon orbits the earth for billions of years, And now you're claiming to change course? This is not a kindergarten, say it! During the last flight, a lunar probe recorded something in this area. What's that? -We do not know. We have photometry of the spectrum of gases coming out. Where is it? -Mare Crisium. How many times do I have to tell you, I need Deputy Director Fowler, now! It's urgent! I know what a restraining order is, but if you at NASA don't listen, how come ... - Hello? What would Elon do? Fuzz Aldrin, how many times do I have to tell you? In the litter-box! Oh, my God. Astronaut's day? Well that's today. Fuzz, you're a genius! You have treats later. Our teacher says you're a loser. He complains. You really don't look like an astronaut. So, are you going to teach us about space or what? Brian. Brian! Open the damn door. You're three months late! Oh, shit! I can hear you in there! Oh, shit! - Brian! Simply put, the moon is a megastructure. Do you understand? It's huge! Artificial. Whoever built it must have thought we were a poor species. I won't even talk about eclipses. They are possible only because it is Oh, my God The moon is exactly 400 times smaller than the sun, and exactly 400 times closer to Earth. Does anyone know why this is so? Because the moon is a megastructure? - Someone is listening! Let me tell you something, kids. When Apollo 12 dropped the empty tank, The moon rang like a bell from the impact. And it rang for hours. Do you know why? Because the damn moon is hollow. Put that in your pipe and smoke it. Hi, there. I'm Brian Harper. I should be speaking here today. KC houseman, megastructuralist. I'm really honored. Excuse me, who are you? I discovered something shocking. You need to connect me to NASA immediately. NASA and I don't really talk these days. - That will change. When you tell them the moon has come out of its orbit. -Really? Kids, I'm going to fix this. I'll be right back. Look at the data. The natural body does not change its orbit overnight. And my natural body is moving away from you. There's something wrong with the moon's energy source. -Safe. I knew you'd believe me. They usually think I'm crazy. Guys, send this guy out because he's posing like me and scaring the kids. I didn't introduce myself like you. - Sir, come with us. I don't need another lunatic who claims the moon is out of orbit. I'm not crazy! Read this! Bye. Are you calling me inadvertently? - Turn to channel 16. - Are we talking now? Are you watching? Two suspects went through at least two red lights ... Some idiot ran away from the police. Oh, yeah. That idiot is your son! Sonny doesn't even have a car, I'm still fixing the Mustang. Tom gave him a car for his birthday. Oh, my God. Do you see this? They're under arrest. Today's chase will not end well for them. Next case. Sonny Neil Harper. It says here that you are 18 years old. This means that you are of legal age. Will you just shut up? Because of the recklessness of your actions and the quantities of banned substances present at the time of your arrest ... Your Honor, it wasn't his drug, it was from a friend. - Silence in my courtroom. - He was just scared ... - That's enough. Executor! Your Honor, we apologize for the client's father. Oh, my God We are ready to pay bail immediately. Money is not a problem. That means there's a risk of escape. - We didn't want to offend the court ... I'm postponing this bail hearing until next week. Bailiff, get Mr. Harper out. - Don't listen to him! You can't put him in jail, please! Sonny, I'll get you out! If you're looking for a life offer, come to Tom Lopez Lexus. You're not just a customer here. We treat you like family. Do you even know how the court works? - Your lawyer didn't do anything. You know better than him I pay $ 50,000 ?! I thought money wasn't a problem. - It's a problem when you don't have it. Nicely done, by the way. Sonny is now risky to escape. -The guy's amazing. Everybody calm down. What happened? - Brian opened his mouth and gave a speech! - Go to hell, Tom! - And you're floating into space far away from us! - Guys! We're all trying to help sonny. - Since when does Brian help Sonny? - Brenda, what do you see in that bastard? - And you're like a guy, huh? Why wasn't he in college? - He moved out when you bought him an apartment. Ask him. / i> He hardly returns my calls. - Me too KC, is that you? -Hi Mom. Rosmarinus officinalis Some studies say the scent of rosemary can boost short-term memory. That's nice, darling. Thank you. No, no, no, let me. So, how are you? -Great. But enough about me. Everyone here knows my son is a genius who works for NASA. I beg your pardon ?! I'm nobody, mom. - You're someone to me! Actually, I did find something, but it doesn't matter. Nobody wants to listen to me. - Then make them. Make them listen? Oh, hello. Are you new here? No, Mom. It's me, KC. Your son. Somebody tell me what I'm watching. - The moon has entered an elliptical orbit. What does that mean? - He'll visit us three times before it reaches Roche's 17,000-mile mark. At that point, pieces the size of a city will start falling on us. So we have three months. -Not really. As they get closer, our "months" will be shorter. We estimated the time frame at about three weeks. Maybe less than that. - We got new footage. Jesus Christ! Is it a hole in the crater? What can we do? We need to go to the moon, see what's going on. -What? I've heard from Europe. Potentially, the STC-62 may be ready tomorrow. Potentially? Great. I'll report to the president on "maybe something." In the meantime, you all keep quiet about this! Oh, my God That could be a problem. - It's been on Twitter since two minutes ago. Your ex- husband. -Thank you. Hey, doug. I'm a little busy. - Is that true? Tell me it's not true. I'd love to, but math doesn't lie. Everything is correct. How's Jimmy? - You'd know to call here and there. Please don't start. I keep calling him. I'm sorry, I have to go. Your Honor. -Jesus! Isn't it enough to hang up? I need you for two minutes. - I'm listening to your door. I can give you a classic motorcycle and a son's Mustang as a pledge until I get the money. Are you trying to bribe me? On court? - I just want my son back. The courts are closed. - They're opening on Monday. -Heavy. What does that mean? - Look, I'm trying to leave while I can. I suggest the same to you. Live from NASA talking about the moon coming out of orbit. Astronomers have noticed bright lights on the moon. - Who is the anonymous source? Please! We are convinced that the reconnaissance mission will provide troubleshooting information. No need to panic. That's all for now. You just lied to the whole country. - Come on, you're working for me. I work for the American people, and you deceive them. NASA completely minimizes the problem. Imagine the tide how they penetrate hundreds of miles ashore. That is what awaits us. Oh, my God Hey. -All flights were canceled and I got stuck in traffic. - I'm sorry Go to a higher place, that's the only way to survive. Let's go to aspen. -And Sonny? We can't leave him there. - And we won't He'll be out as soon as the judge bail. And I'll move him to Colorado. Are we going to colorado? - No, Tom. Earth's stronger gravity will completely tear the moon apart. Oh, okay. Google, turn off the TV. Girls, pack up. - Turn off the TV Get your boots too. Hurry up. We need to start thinking about girls. And trust me, we won't forget about Sonny. Countdown to five seconds Four, three, two ... ... 1. Ignition. That's it. The whole world is holding its breath while a joint NASA and ESA mission takes to the skies. The nation hopes for the success of the mission as frantic customers pile up supplies. The growing horror of the moon encourages massive migration from urban areas. Civilization has already degenerated. Robbery has become a major pastime in the UK. Fear and panic prevail. The National Guard is struggling to establish order. Come to your senses, brothers and sisters! The stars are falling from the sky. Be aware! These armed religious fanatics gathered thousands of followers ... Prominent scientists are now exploring the possibility. that the moon is a kind of megastructure. A term popularized by French astronomers. Megastructures are planet-sized objects powered by a captured star. This once radical opinion is now rooted in scientists. Let's go! Hands in the air! Take it easy. You're that astronaut the other day. I accidentally threw away some important papers. Luckily for you, there was no pick-up all week. - Yes, I'm lucky. Orbital distance? Are you looking for this? Fellow megastructurists, if you're watching this, You know there's a problem that only we can solve. An emergency meeting has been called for today at the LA Palm Hotel at 6:00 p.m. Free pastries Entering lunar orbit complete. We are approaching Mare Crisium. We're starting the capsule rotation. - I confirm. Fifteen degrees. 30. 45. 70 ... 90. STC-62 is in position. Houston, do you see this? Yes, we see. Send a probe. All right. I release the probe. Ready for phase two. - It goes down evenly. Oh, my God Why idiots at NASA don't see the real problem? Oh, my God Apparently they haven't read Carl Sagan's work where he makes it clear how a natural satellite can't be hollow! I've been saying that for years, Dr. Houseman. - That doesn't help us now, Ziggy. In this room are the smartest visionaries in this world. We all know the moon was built. There must be ways to fix it. Think outside the box. - Oswald is guilty! Damn it, gary, not now! Oh, Mr. Harper. What are you doing here? I'm probably very wrong. We can talk? How did you find me? It's your website. - You read my blog. You knew about this before anyone, before NASA. How? Why bother? You will say again that I am crazy. Test me. I've been studying distant planets for years looking for megastructures in orbit. I never dreamed one would be here in our backyard. Have you heard of a Dyson Sphere? -That. Every megastructure has a solid shell around its energy source. Most likely a white dwarf. Something obviously happened to the one on our moon. That's why he's off course! Yeah, still crazy. Why are you here if you don't trust me? Because I know what it's like when no one wants to listen to you. The probe has reached a depth of 24.5 kilometers. 25 km. She stopped 25 miles. It's still standing. -Stop it? - He's coming back. Twenty-four kilometers. 20. - 15 ... - We have another problem. The moon is reversing. -Please? The orbit is straightening. Houston, we have a malfunction. Houston, do you read? Do you hear ?! What the hell is that? -I do not know. Breakthrough of the hull! Helmets! Breakthrough news. NASA has corrected the initial projection The moon's orbit above the earth The governor ordered a mass evacuation of the entire west coast. People are advised to go to elevated ground immediately. People! The tide is coming! We have to get out of here now! Everybody up! Immediately! Climb up! KC, what are you doing? KC! KC, hold on! I can't swim! -Dr. Houseman! -Hold on! There he is! -Hold on! Some kind of self-aware, self-replicating individual. Like a machine? - Machines have no intelligence. This has. Everything we were afraid of about UI. And he knew we were coming, he was probably attracted to the electronics from the capsule. Everything we thought we knew about space just fell into the water. We're not ready for this. Deb, don't complain, pack your things. We're leaving. Will you give up? - And what would you like me to do? Help us win this thing. We have nothing to fight against. You've been aiming for my job for a long time. Congratulations, it's yours. Oh, my God What are you keeping from me? You have "Q" approval. The hole is in Mare Crisium! This was Harper's case. If you want to dig into NASA's secrets, visit Holdenfield. Here's your approval. How did you get in here? - Hutchings gave me this. I need all the records on STX-136A. Are you waiting for something? What the hell is this? What are you doing? Oh, Holdenfield? - You shouldn't see this, 136A. It has a top secret label. - Why is NASA lying about this? July 20, 1969. Oh, my God This is a small step for a man, but a big leap for ... blah, blah, blah. In school, you learned that Apollo 11 lost contact with Control for two minutes. It's not true. Mission control interrupted their transmission to the world Because they found something that day. Strange, pulsing lights below the surface of the moon. I was tasked with keeping it a secret. Apollo crews cooperated. And everyone after, except Brian Harper. They declared him crazy. And discarded as garbage. You claim the moon is actually the biggest lie in human history? The biggest? Probably. And you have blood on your hands. Anyone who follows orders always bleeds their hands, right? That technology is light years ahead of us. Compared to that, we're in the Stone Age. The only chance we had to stop it was Zulu X-ray 7. But it was canceled, cleaned up, for financial reasons. Well, Commander, I have an urgent job waiting for me on the table. We're all running out of time. It's actually leaked already. I'm really sorry. Really. What's the matter? - I can't call my son. Are you an astronaut? Then you must know that the entire interior of the moon is full of fruit. KC, tell the market manager I'll throw him out the window soon. Let's find an empty room. - Where do you think the Incas got their potatoes from? Are you saying if we destroy that thing ...? - We have a theory so the moon can return to its orbit. How are we supposed to do that? You said yourself we shouldn't use modern spacecraft. I'm working on a solution. - We appreciate the effort, but this is a military operation from now on. Doug, wait up! Are you launching nuclear weapons, Radioactive fallout will kill everyone! - Who mentioned nuclear? You're making a big mistake. Please let me make a plan. We have a plan. Look, you and Jimmy could come to Colorado with me. They'd be safe there. - What are you asking me to give up? I ask you to think of our son. - And I mean our son Where is he? -In jail. He's a good kid, he just made a mistake. - I've always done nonsense, too. My parents had to put up with me. We never had money, But it used to be found for fish and chips. I would sit on the dock and watch the stars. That's where I first dreamed of becoming an astronaut. After my father passed away, my mother and I returned to America. My dad laughed when I told him I wanted to be an astronaut. He didn't believe in you. -To put it mildly. Oh, my God I broke down to enter NASA. I know all about your last mission. You saw alien technology. And NASA insisted it was a meteor. - But he wasn't. I've never seen anything like it. And worst of all, I lost a friend upstairs. Through his own fault. How's your fault? You saved the shuttle and Fowler. It really helped me. Divorced, broke, son hates me. How I envy you. Alien technology! The law! Extreme weather is ravaging the east coast and the bay area. High tides and floods are destroying homes and properties. If you're not already on high, you better get going now ... As a foreign student, are you sure they'll let me into the bunker? Yeah, don't worry. I'll take care of it. -Thank you. These pictures come from Bangladesh ... Mom, are we going to die? - No, no, honey. I know this all looks really scary, but we're not going to die. We'll be safe at Dad's in Colorado. - Will you send more rockets to the moon? No, we won't. You know why? Because we don't have these anymore. Why don't you? - Because everyone's in museums. And ... I love you, honey. Hey, doug. What is the ZX-7? - Who told you about that? - Come on, what is it? Zulu X-ray 7 was a prototype EMP device. The program has been suspended. This on the moon is obviously technological, isn't it? - They thought the EMP could get him? - Never mind because we can't go into space. How far have the tests progressed? Jocinda, NASA does not have approval for another mission. - You leave it to me. The landing site has been murdered in GPS. Compensate for the width by -4.5 ° west. 4.5 degrees, reception. We slow down to 10 knots. Open the door! Oh, yeah? -Brian Harper? -That. You should come with us. It is about national security. All right, give me a second. I'm not going nowhere without him. - We're a team. Uh, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! It's been almost three hours. That can't be a good sign. What kind of pills are you swallowing? You're really sweating. Are you OK? I did. I didn't. I broke into college several times. I lost two of their vacuum cleaners. They probably know. You're kidding! - Look, I don't want to be here either. Have a seat. - Oh no, I don't take orders from you anymore. But tell me, do you still know how to fuck a friend? - Are you talking about me? People! Oh, my God What is this one? KC Houseman, Mrs. I sent you a few emails but you never answered. What's this about? - Follow me. You will see something that only a few have seen. KC knew before you that the moon was out of orbit. Social media went wild when I posted my results. Are you an anonymous source? -Oh yeah! -Oh God! Mosley, show me the tunnel. The readings estimate a depth of over 25 km. It's Mare Crisium. -That. I think it's from years ago directly responsible for this now. - Do you trust me now? I saw the video from the helmet. - It's a little late to apologize. They both lied to us. The reconnaissance mission didn't go wrong, She was attacked. A technological form of life. - Don't ...! During the attack, the Moon tried to return to its old orbit Until this thing came back inside. - That's what I'm telling you. Something's doing the core of the megastructure. -Pardon? Megastructure? Don't ask. - They're probably ours The moon was built by aliens. We have to go inside and make first contact! - I told you not to ask. We plan to attack this thing. The only problem is which recognizes our technology. And that's why we need you. I never thought I'd hear that from you again. You're the only one to land a shuttle without electronics. - Not a recommendation. At the moment it is. That's why I'm offering you your job back. And I personally ask you for help. Come on, Brian. I don't know. I also have my problems over my head. And the Moon that falls to Earth is not one of them? I was wrong to bring you. And done. How do you plan to go upstairs? You know all the shuttles are in museums? Endeavor is here in LA. And the Chinese offer us its a prototype lander. I know, it's crazy. - No, what you showed us was crazy. This is a whole other level of madness. - So it's for you. Oh, my God If I agree, I'll need something in return. Did you get it? -Yes I am. It is being resolved. Sonny will be coming to Vandenberg. - We missed the party, it seems. I wasn't even invited. -FUCK THE MOON At least someone else thinks like us. Hey, look what I found! It can be used as toilet paper. -What? -Look around! It's worthless. Attention! Please get off the streets and don't go out! Man, let's get out of here! This is really exciting, isn't it? As world leaders seek solutions, New images suggest NASA may be planning a new mission to the moon. But so far, neither NASA nor the White House have commented. We got this from our correspondent in Southeast Asia. The moon is causing a drastic increase in tectonic activity. There have been reports of countless earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. -WANDENBERG AIR BASE- Strange. -What? The moon doesn't have enough gravity for that no matter how close. You still don't get it? It is a megastructure. Your rules no longer apply. How long have we been here? And no one painted it? I'm starting to like it. Where's sonny? - The team we sent hasn't called in a few days. Why didn't you tell me? - Because you need to focus on this here. The megastructure plant doesn't have an exhaust system. - The moon has an engine? Keep thinking, I'll be right back. Oh, my God At least your husband showed up with this. - Ex-husband. Oh, Colonel. - I'm Colonel Reed. This is Captain Avery. Gen. Davidson instructed us in the matter. We will explain the military procedure to you. I'm an astronaut, not a soldier. I'll take you, but I won't detonate the bombs. We're not asking you to do that. We'll go with you and activate the device, but you need to know the procedure if there are any complications. Security measures removed. It can be activated remotely without permission from Earth. Two clicks, then press here and hold. And the device will explode. It's simple. - Yes, simply. We're approaching Vandenberg. -Received. - I should have taken your jumbo portion. - Thank you for getting me out. Thank your dad. The plan is to take off when the moon is closest. Since the target is unpredictable, navigation will be crucial. Navigator Carl Sanders will make sure we hit the target. Oh, my God Technician Hannah Martin will calculate the current trajectory to intercept the Moon. When we get out of the atmosphere, we'll get fuel. Luckily, friends from SpaceX already have a fuel depot in orbit. I love Elon. When we turn off the engines, the nozzles will be placed above the Mare Crisium. The Chinese have redesigned the systems so we can operate without electronics. Oh, my God We'll separate the rover part where the bomb will be, And turn the electronics back on to lure him out of the hole. And then you're going to pull the trigger and kill that thing. And then we can all go home nice. - If we still have it. What did I say? -Sonny! Thank God you're fine! Wait, let me see if I understand. Will you take the bomb into space? And what are you doing here anyway? You hate NASA! Understand, if there's the slightest chance this will work ... What if it doesn't work? -Must! I want you to have a world where you can grow into a better man than me. What did you see there? - Shuttle and space things Do you miss me? - Yes, I really miss you. And you to me, little man. Is Mom there? Mom, it's dad. (Commander Fowler, let's practice refueling. - Here, I'm going.) He's getting good. Oh, yeah? - I fulfilled my part of the deal. - I want you and Jimmy in Colorado. - We're leaving as soon as we launch the shuttle. Oh, my God If anyone finds out what I am done for you ... -No. You just keep your trigger-happy friends away from the nuclear plants. I'm sorry, I've been looking everywhere. No 2% milk. -Thank you. You know, I almost got a job at NASA, too. - In which department? The janitor. Is this a calculation of your current lunar orbit? -Yes why? Apparently the increased mass of the moon is not included. Do you see how the current orbit increases seismic activity? We know that the gravity on the surface of the Moon is 1.62 per m². At least she was. So this must be wrong. Sorry, we have a problem. - We just needed an earthquake. There's a cold leak. - There must be a way to fix it. Not here, the whole Michoud team needs to fix something like this. Call anyone who can help us. - Everyone who can is already here. We need to consider letting these people go to safety. Are you sure? These people will not have a planet if we do not come up with something! Brian, we're out of one engine. Launch is no longer an option. Thank you for bringing me here. Everybody listen here. You did more than anyone could ask of you. Oh, my God You have my deepest gratitude as well as the gratitude of the whole country. But it's time to go. I order the immediate evacuation of all staff from Vandenberg. Go to your families in Colorado. Oh, my God Dad. I'm sorry it didn't work out. - The story of my life. Thank you for getting me out of jail. Let's pick things up. It's time to go. The helicopter is waiting. Let's go. Go, I'll catch up with you. Why are you still here? When it comes again, the moon's gravity will be 80% of the Earth! I know how it sounds, but we checked. That's right. Show the director the new simulation. We need to speed up the launch! Guys, where have you been? Look. No launch. The mission is over. Wait a minute. How do you feel about flying a shuttle with only two engines? -Impossible. Oh, my God If we launch when the Moon is just above, increased gravity You should launch the shuttle into orbit. I evacuated the entire crew. I can't drive alone. That's why I'm going with you. My team will launch, but we have very little time. You have to be ready in exactly 28 minutes. You fly, I'll be the navigator. As in the old days. What do you say? -What about the EMP device? - He's still in the lander. We'll have to activate it ourselves, but you listened to the instructions, didn't you? Two clicks, push the button and hold. And the device explodes. Simply. You figured that out yourself? - And he calculated a new launch path. You know, without electronics, we're going to have to calculate manually in no time. In addition, we were left without a technician on board. No, I don't even have authority. I'm the acting director of NASA and I just authorized you. Congratulations. I have an SNC. Irritable Bowel Syndrome. I also get seasick. - You said you always wanted to be an astronaut. I have extreme anxiety. -KC, if the moon is what you claim, We're going to need a megastructuralist. Get dressed. I dialed your dad's number here. He knows you're coming. I know it wasn't always easy with me. - Neither do you with me. You know this was all your idea? You're so smart. But now you have to be brave. - I don't want you to go. I love you more than all the stars in the sky. More than the entire Milky Way? -Much more. A lot more. Watch him. Take care of yourself upstairs. Take this. I hope you don't need. Stay away from major roads. - Dad ... - Go. You can start a car, can't you? Just so you know, my driver's license was taken away. We have to go now. Mom, you won't believe where I'm going. -Jack, when are you coming home for dinner? Mom, it's me KC, your son. You said make them listen to me. And they listened. Where did you get these suits? From donations? - Early Apollo. No electronics. You should be good. -She should be? Encouraging. -Let's go! Oh, ma'am. Houseman, we have to go. Mom? Give me a paramedic. Yes? - Are you evacuating? -Every moment. Take care of my mom, please. -Of course. Sir, we must hurry. We're going to be very tight, okay? Turn on APU 1, 2, 3. - APUs active. Reaction control system on. - Autopilot on. Countdown to 30 seconds Endeavor, you're getting a huge gravitational wave! Launch now! Did he say "gravity wave"? Guys, get out! 10 seconds, 9, - 8, 7 ... - Fuck. I start the engine. It'll be close! We're under water! Oh, my God Back in the car! The ascent path is wrong. The right rocket is losing power. Thrust is zero. Carry us to the right. 11 degrees. 12. 13. We better do something or we'll crash. - I shouldn't have gone! Let's drop another rocket, let the moon pull us. KC, can we? Come on, buddy. - Current momentum, gravity ... - Can we? -I do not know! Drop the rockets. -Done. If this doesn't work, we're dead. - Then he better succeed. The main tank is empty. Get rid of him. - I'm separating him. Brie, we're too slow. Oh, my God We will not succeed! Wait a minute. Look at our speed. It's still rising. Guys ... This will be the last broadcast here on KSOQ radio. Seek shelter, hug your loved ones, may these last moments be worth it. I'll put on an old thing to repeat, to cheer you up a little. What does that mean? Those are my parents' names. - I have a similar one. - Jonas brothers? - Excuse me? Come on, I'm kidding. If only you had seen each other. Don't scare me like that. Oh, my God Hey, buddy, you could now call dad. - Dad? - Are you okay? Oh, yes. Sonny was driving faster than the crazy water. Driving? Who is Sonny? Where's mom? She stayed to help Sir, I'm the son of Brian Harper. Let's go to you. We're not close yet, but we're fast. There's strong security here. Call when you're close to give you permission. - Okay. Thank you. Thank you for looking after my son. KC, maneuver very gently, as I showed you. All right, very gentle. I can do it. Oh, my God Carefully. Turn on pairing with the station and we'll take over. I can't believe what I just did. - You sure you haven't done that before? As a kid, I disguised myself as an astronaut for Halloween. Scottie Ebersol told me I would never go into space because I'm fat. If only Scottie Ebersol saw you now. Open the fuel valves on the shuttle. It says "fuel valve" on them. Copy that. Valves wide open. -Great. I have to admit something. I wasn't sure you were the right man for this. I have to admit something too. It really is "Blessing the Rain in Africa". I looked. I told you. KC, close the fuel valves, please. Valves closed. Yeah, turn around. We have to go. And I hope it's not too late. -That. As the moon approaches the earth, Scientists warn of the extreme effects of gravity. Uh, what a night. My car was dying, can you take me? Get out! Immediately! Don't repeat! -Just calm down. Stop it! Leave him alone. -Turn away. What's in the bag, kid? (-Do what he says. -The guy's an idiot!) Stop running! -Hey, let him go. -Shut up! All right, everyone calm down! - Look at Mr. Pametnjakovic. Are you a student? - All right, let's go! -Move away. The phone stayed in the bag. How do we get into the bunker? We need another car and I think I know where to find it. I'm shutting down the mainframe. You can turn off the whole power. -Alright. If Houston was following us, we'd be crazy. Crazy sailors had it for navigation centuries ago. Don't bother her, we'll end up on Neptune. KC, give me the position of the moon in 93 minutes. Oh, my God Okay ... Given his current position, he will be at latitude 3 degrees 12 minutes south, Longitude 5 degrees and 12 minutes west. Brie, let's start with a 43-second push. -Okay. Three, two, one. Guys, look! Let's move on. At least the moon lasts a little longer in one piece. - I'm turning us around. Hold the OMS jets for between 8 and 10 seconds. -Alright. Kochim! This didn't sound good. - It's nothing. I hope we don't need that. Jimmy, hold my hand. Oh, my God Let's go! Jimmy, hold on. - Don't let go! Michelle! There he is. It's in airplane mode. - I'm going to prepare the lander. -Good. Get him, Commander! Rover electronics on. I'm going back to Endeavor. I can't imagine how hard it is for him to be up there again. It bElongs up here. He still blames himself for what happened on the last mission. He thinks he's to blame for that astronaut's death. We should go. Let's go. Oh, my God Why is nothing happening? Wait, wait, wait! He's going after the bait. Come on, come on! What are you waiting for? -Something is wrong. We have to get him. - It's too far. It won't work. He's coming for us. -Bri? Don't stop! -I see! KC, your phone! Turn it off! Come on, come on! You could have just turned it off. - Brie, you said at trial When the swarm returned, it didn't attack the shuttle? -That. - The electronics didn't work. That's why he didn't attack us then, and that's why he didn't go after the bomb now. He has to feel both. Searches for organic matter in the electronic environment. That's right! - It's basically us. We humans. - We have another problem. Army. They will use everything they have to stop the moon. - You're not serious? I'm dead serious. They will launch nuclear power plants. And the radioactive fallout? Your friends don't think of that? First, they're not my friends. And they don’t think about tomorrow but try to survive today. So that's their big plan, huh? I haven't come this far to fail. We need to figure out how to kill this thing. I'll get the lander back and we'll go after him. Does he mean "the moon"? - I'm afraid that's what he means. When do they plan to launch? - I don't know, they didn't really tell me. But if they're going to use ICBMs, they have to wait for the moon to enter the stratosphere. It's less than two hours. This is private property. Get out of here. - My mom lives here. I'm Brenda Lopez's son. I've never seen that kid. Call unit 23. Stay there. I just want to get a car to my house. Please! Don't move or I'll shoot again! I have the right to defend my property, Tom. -Karen, cut it out! I'm glad you're okay. - Do I look good to you? You fled to the mountains ?! - No court worked, I tried everything. All right, let's get you inside. I'm Tom. Thank you very much, Karen! Girls, wait here. Sonny! -Hey, Mom. -Are you OK? -Yes I am. This is Michelle and Mrs. Fowler's son, Jimmy. -Hi company. Come in. How did you get out? - Dad pulled me out. -Where is he? - Upstairs stops this. Where up? - In space, Tom. Of course it's worse. -Damn way to avoid rent. Oh, Sonny! - I missed you so much. Shut up! -... for the entire Aspen Valley. There will be a dissipation of the atmosphere ... I repeat. Warning. Mandatory evacuation for the entire Aspen Valley. There will be dissipation ... - What is "dissipation of the atmosphere"? The air will be sucked out, dumb. -Lauren! We need to get to Jimmy's dad. -Military complex, a couple of hours north. A couple of hours, huh? We won't be on time. I have an idea. We have to dress well. Come on. - Put on your jacket. All right, switched to maneuver controls. Connection complete. We are ready to go. Get down, get down! -I have it! Are we dead? No, we're just on the moon. It's perhaps the most spectacular sentence anyone has ever said. I sold these a couple of cars. Sonny, I know you don't love me. But believe it or not, I always considered you a son. If this is the end of the world, can we not hate each other for the last few hours? I don't hate you. - You know what? I accept. Let's keep looking. I found oxygen. Come here. We'll have to do it twice. How deep do you think we are? At least 20 kilometers. Can you bring us a little closer to the wall? This must be the hull of a megastructure. The moon's mantle is just a protective shell. Brilliant! I don't see anything. I have to turn on the electronics. Hold on! Please tell me this is not a dream. They're turning. They look like hoops. Or rings. The moon must be stabilizing like this. Some kind of gyroscopic system. All right, this should be enough for now. You did all this for us? You should not have. Don't stop for us. Let's go this way. And thank you for loading us with all that oxygen. Drop your weapons! Immediately! I really hate guns. - And that backpack, throw it to him. Let's go. No games, stay here. And don't think of following us. Where did you get the gun? -My dad. - Why doesn't that surprise me? All right, you drive. Did you rob that guy? - Technically, they robbed us. So we robbed them in return! Oh, my God. It's a white dwarf. I knew it. They have tamed the basic building blocks of space! Don't look at me. Maybe I'll cry. All heaven! Fields! So Ziggy was right after all. - Who's Ziggy? A friend. His theory is that all megastructures are actually arches. Ziggy smokes a lot of weed. There he is. Yeah, get the detonator ready. I'll get closer and then disconnect the rover. Ready. Wait for him to come. I'll disconnect the rover. Brian, what are you doing? -Not me! What do you mean, not you? - I don't know, I'm flying alone! Oh, shit! He's devouring the lander! We'll hit! Hold on! Oxygen - critical Attention! - We have approval from the president for the launch. All nuclear silos are activated, sir. -Good. General, we've had problems, but we're leaving Aspen right now. It's hours away and there's no time. Sonny, look out! I'll call you later. Oh, shit! The moon is rising. - Gravity will go crazy. They're shooting at us! -Return! -What? -Here you go. What the hell are you doing? Tom, watch out! Wait, I'll switch car in warp. Step on it! Keep up the pace! Watch out! Step on it before it sucks us in! -I am trying! Hold on! Oh, shit! It hit the kid! We have to go back! -Not! It's over! We need that oxygen! Slow down! General? - Find shelter now We're launching. Big pieces of the moon will fall on us. There will be radiation. - Wait a minute, my dad's upstairs with Fowler. Jocinda stayed down. - No, she's upstairs with my dad. Get me Jimmy on the phone. - Friend, Dad needs you. Daddy? - I'm so sorry I can't be with you now. I love you very much. Don't be afraid, Dad. Mom will save us. There's no oxygen. Jimmy, we have to go. -I have to go. Hi, Dad! Sir, we are ready for you. Let's go up that pass. That tunnel is 400 m of concrete. Come on, darling. Let's go. We can breathe. - It smells weird. Gravity. Where's Brian? This will not fly again. Look at these babies! I told you, the moon was built by aliens. Oh, Brian. Brian! Oh, Brian Harper! - How many Brian do you think there are in the moon? Whatever this place is made of, I'm sure of one thing. It's stronger than anything on Earth. Which explains why that thing took years to get into. Wait! It is very likely that this is a trap. How do you know he's in there at all? I don't know. But I know something is leading us. I think these are two opposing intelligent entities. And one obviously loves us more than the other. Oh, no! I knew it was a trap! Do you hear that? Come on. Why do you think about this moment so often? I gave it to you the day before my last mission. When I came back, everything changed. - So this is a happy memory? All memories of my son are happy. What is this? You're not my son. What are you? - I'm a construct, out of your mind. Who created you? -The same ones who created you. Oh, my God Billions of years ago, Your ancestors were a flourishing civilization in a distant part of the galaxy. They were so advanced. They spread from their home planet in the habitats they built in space. All social conflicts have been resolved, and the wars were just a memory of times long past. Your ancestors created a perfect and harmonious world Controlled by a central self-learning computer system. who served them in all their daily needs. You call it UI. Artificial intelligence. The future seemed limitless, And then one day everything changed. Oh, Mom! Their own creation turned against them. UI suddenly developed consciousness and transformed into countless swarms of nanotechnology. They all rebelled at once. The UI refused to be a slave to a species it considered inferior. She started the war, persecuting and destroying all biological life to eliminate any threat to your existence. You miss your son. I can feel it. I don't know if he's still alive. What the hell are you ?! -Our Moon's operating system. I'm programmed to tell you about the origin of your planet. On the verge of extinction, your ancestors fled to a secret corner of the galaxy. They've been building planetary structures there for generations. run by a benevolent UI and powered by the abundant energy of captured stars. These armored vessels are designed to look for ideal conditions in space To give birth to a new life. But only one of them, your Moon, was sent on time. before the last of your ancestors were discovered and destroyed. Why didn't they go in them? -These swarms attack all electronic objects if they contain organic life. They had to be empty. Our ancestors gave their existence .... So that one day people can be born again. Oh, my God Your solar system was one of the few convenient places to begin the creation of a new and habitable planet. i> After your planet was born, your ancestors planted it. My own genetic signature. The code of life. Your world has turned its back on you, and yet you are still fighting for it. You fight for the people you love. Like your son? What would you give for him? Your life for his? -Absolutely! Why not? - Because he's my son. And I love him more than he will ever know. What do you want from me? - Find out if you're ready. For what? - We need a man to lure the swarm away from the core to get the moon back into orbit. We need you, Brian, to join the fight. Oh, Brian! - What's happening to him? Oh, Brian! Wake up! Yeah! -I'm here. The moon must survive. It all depends on him. -Let's go out. We are part of an intergalactic war that has been going on for billions of years. There are thousands of these swarms. They're searching the universe for the only month that escaped them. - That's crazy! And 12 years ago, one found us. We have to hurry. Brian, what's the plan? - Save the moon, save the earth. KC was right. -Yes I am? - The swarm is suffocating the moon's core. We have to get him out to destroy him. How do we do that? Lander is broken. Are you doing that? -Yeah. We also seem to have new transportation. If I can fix the lander, why don't they destroy that swarm? He fixed the moon's defense system. But not the whole. It doesn't make sense to me. -Our ancestors created a UI that deleted them. Ancestors? -Same DNA. - So the aliens who built the moon ... - Our ancestors. Wait a minute, because my brain just exploded. How do you know that? I saw it! Then why doesn't the swarm invade Earth and kill us all? If the moon survives, he knows organic life can develop again. So he's trying to kill two flies with one blow? -That. -Society... Look at this. - God bless you! We got an upgrade. - They're helping us kill that thing. But we must let him know that we are here. I hate to say it, but we're running out of time. The army will launch in 10 minutes. If we're going to kill this thing, we have to do it now. We can't, it will destroy the moon's core. I have a plan. Oh, my God Brian! I see him. Let's go, your mommy! They also redesigned the engines. Crazy mod. Oh, my God From a navigational point of view, it's going in the completely wrong direction, But I won't say anything. Dad, don't work anymore. -Not? -I can not breathe. Hold your breath. Where are Tom and Nikki? When you were little, this is how I taught you to walk. Left, right, left. Left ... count with me. I'm behind you. -Left, right ... Dad, are you okay? - I'll get some rest. Find Mom, okay? Just keep going. Left, right, left ... - Left, right, left ... - Just keep going. I'm right behind you. I love you! There he is again! Oh, my God! Spaceships! We have to get very close to those ships. That's it! Left, right, left. Left, right ... Where's Daddy? - He was right behind me. Tom! - When was the last time you saw Dad? -I do not know. Tom! The oxygen is coming back. No, I'll look for him. -Get away. - You have to take care of them! Go deeper into the tunnel. Trust me, Mom! Sonny, look out! Oh, Sonny! I'm going to look for him! Watch out for Jimmy, please. Oh, Sonny! Let's go. The moon has entered the atmosphere above the north. Atlantic. - General, 20 seconds. At three. Three, two, one ... Doug, what the hell are you doing? Oh, my God My ex-wife is upstairs. -And mine's down here and I'm trying to save her. Put the key back in the console! - I'm not sure how, But I believe he can save us. - Give me the damn key! What the hell are you doing? Put the gun away! -I can not. Oh, Sonny! Brian, why are we slowing down? - Is he behind us? I don't see him. -Yeah, take over until I get EMP ready. I'll stay in the bomb rover. You and KC take the lander and get out of here. That was your plan? To use yourself as bait? Someone has to be inside or it won't work. -No no no. KC, go behind and let me know if that thing comes up. Oh, my God Come on. Brie, I'm the director of NASA. The decision is mine, not yours. And I command the mission. I'm staying. - There must be another way! He's gone, and you know it. We have to kill that thing or it will kill us! What's the matter with you? You put the fate of the world in the hands of an ex-wife And a failed astronaut ?! - She's never let me down before. God help you if you're wrong! - God help us all. Oh, Sonny! Sonny, wake up! No, you shouldn't have come back! - We're not leaving anyone, okay? Brian, you're not going to do that! KC! Take it. KC! What are you doing? Not! No! What are you doing? My mom always says, "Better to ask for forgiveness than ask permission." Open the door! - Everyone made fun of me. But you listened to me when no one else wanted to. Do something for me. Go to my mom. Tell her her son wasn't a loser. I won't let you do this! -Briane, You didn't kill that astronaut. You saved Director Fowler. And now you're not killing me, Oh, my God than you save everyone else The world needs you, Brian. You hold the key to our Moon's knowledge. Thank you for believing my crazy story. You're not crazy. People, listen, I need to ease my soul. I'm not a real doctor. I put it on business cards because it sounds great. Go save the world, Dr. Houseman. You underestimated us! Get out of here! Sonny, the moon will help us! Come on, let's go one more time! Now! It's gonna hit us! Hold on, Bree! I'll take you home. Sonny! Thank you for giving it back to me. Mom? That's you? Yes, they are here. Where are you? Isn't the Chrysler Building in New York? Are you okay? I did. What did I miss? - Well, the kids are fine. And the Earth ... Surprisingly, in one piece. Oh, my God You know, if Earth got a second chance, I think we deserve it too. I'd love that. Is that a locator? - I really hope so. We're a pretty good team, aren't we? Yes, we did. Jimmy! Oh, Dad! We couldn't get to Dad. -It is OK. Where's Tom? I'm so sorry. We wouldn't survive without him. Where's your friend? He saved the world. And the one upstairs too. Hello? Fuzz Aldrin? You were good Oh, Mom. What is this? - Am I still alive? - We scanned your consciousness. You're part of the moon now. No way! So we saved Earth? We should start. Start with what? Subtitles synced and corrected by Bron' Yu Mars! The Melancholic Alcoholic Inc. (c)
