Millions of clean, millions of dirty hands worth money. He has an indescribable love and an indescribable pain. The best wish for money... ... not to take the dirty side. And if you hold... ...Tayfun brother. You'll pull the pike, but... ... you will not pierce the cloth. Why? Because you damage the man's property. If you damage the man's property, he will get angry. Do you know Tayfun, this is my favorite pinwheel ball in my life? Look how it goes round and round on the way to the destination. But there are also some balls in life, their butt plays separately on the way to the goal. What happens then? The target is coming to him. Tayfun... Friends made a count the other day. A box of cakes and a box of mushrooms were missing. >- Are you stealing my property? - Huh? No bro. >- The issue is not about the property anyway. The issue is personality. You didn't know me. I can't stand these bright kids, you know? We wanted to love you because you are the child of our neighborhood. Let's love Cezmi too. >- I didn't see you make a mistake in prison once, is it good? But Cezmi also made a mistake. I wish your father would cum outside, my son. I fined you $50,000 with missing goods. 10 days respite with the clocked education calendar. During this period, you can either put the goods in their place or get rid of this mulberry tree... ...

If my father asks for the money of the system, he will take care of it. >- Okay, don't worry.

I'm already going to pay. I'll call you tomorrow, brother. I'm sorry Pelinsucum... I'm really sorry. - What is my hand? But this behavior was not pleasant at all. We have very valuable customers. >- Well, Mr. Özgür.. >- Özgür Bey's word is a bond for us. We'll handle it somehow. >- Thank you. See you dude. What is this woman like "Kill Bill". Gee. [HORN SOUND] >- The taxi is here, come on, come on. >- What time is the exam? >- OK, I'll call. - Look at me, Özgür, while I'm gone... ...if I hear you're picking up girls home, I'll shatter this place.

Enough, enough. ... he will open it, brother Sabri. Aha. Can this be done to a 4-ton boy like me? Should we carry a mirror on our neck from now on? Is Kelle on the couch? ... let's visit bro? I have been with Ateş Abi for 15 years. Bring the goods, take the goods. Do we have a mistake bro? No. So what's wrong with your brother with a box of cake? ... if a box of mushrooms is lost? Tell me, is there anything that hasn't changed in 15 years? Yes, Umit Besen. Change that tape. >- Brother, you are not listening to me. You are not listening. Everyone talks behind your back in this neighborhood. ... I'm the only one defending you. You're pulling a dog for me too, good luck to you brother. Let's look at your reel. Ates Abi almost cut me off because two boxes of goods were gone. I am deserving of you. You ate the man's money at nightclubs with the wives. Hey! You pressed 100 dollars for every person who said Tayfun Bey, you pressed 100 dollars. After? You saw the donkey's bulge. Brother, not doing anything makes me hairy anyway. Heck of a danger. We told you. We said bring the money and let's trade. You didn't listen. You didn't even answer the phones. You're right, man. I did an amateur job there. You go to bed, pray that you didn't scratch the box. I've already waited for everything there, man. Hussein slaughtered a chicken next to me, ...My mind is gone. - This is Hüseyin, he knows how to cut. Keser returns, the handle turns, but the day comes, the account returns. >- What are we going to do, brother? As if we have 50 armed men, we will engage in combat.

We are not dead yet. But you came at a bad time. Things are not like they used to be. Is it a cut? All our venues have been deciphered. Wherever we gamble... ...the police are there in 15 minutes. I need a place where the police can't reach. But I do have one condition. There's that lady over there playing backgammon, the brunette one. If you don't make me such a wife, you are a dishonest dishonor. Brother, do this for me. If I don't get you the best gac... ... I am dishonest, dishonest brother. Don't worry, man.

Ulan Tunç is dead. # In our minds, we immediately eliminate them and go to the issue objectively. - Of course. There are only three things to pay attention to. One, was there a security camera in the house? Two, eyewitnesses, where are the three empty shells? - Were there any security cameras in the house? - There was no camera, uncle. The house was already an amateur house. The house of a friend of Tayfun. - Did you call Tayfun? - I called, his phone was off. - How many people were in the house, Mr. Huseyin? - 5-6 people. - Where are the hives? - He stayed there in the hives, uncle. Go go, get 3-4 guys from there and go. Bring all those pimps over here. Uncle on the head. Mr. Huseyin, just in case, take a taxi. Do not let the car or license plate attract attention. - How will these things be, brother Bekir? - You know best, brother. This deceased smells like 15 days old tin cheese. The smell made my brain water as it hit. My God, if we could only get rid of this, for the best. Şahin Bey would have some cologne. Pour it on top and break some air. You are right, brother. - Oh - give me some too, bro. - Do you want a brother? - Thank you dear, I won't take it. My God, my God, I'm on fire. My God, I'm on fire.

Someone gets a call, stop. Someone wants to burn themselves with cologne, stop. Someone goes into the forest. We have become toys in the hands of children, Tayfun. Brother, after the forest, Deniz. Let's get rid of it if you want. Whatever you do! Sabri, my girlfriend called, so I had to stop. Don't worry. Also, I am not very happy with the situation we are in. - What are you saying? - So I'm saying...

Give me a cigarette man, my brain is cracking. >- Well, I guess I don't have any left. It's gone. I don't have either, uncle. >- I don't have either. Look in the pocket of the deceased, maybe there is. His brother did not stay here either. Look, I'm not even touching my hand, he's leaving. He's playing himself.

No, if you played me on a trick, so let me know... No, I'm apologizing to you on her behalf, okay? Finished. There is no such thing, bro. I came to this age, I did not hear words from my father. I give my house and I eat brushes, is there such a thing? Or extension! Nevermind! I understand who is what tonight. The guy is making a complex, my son, it is complex. He came, he saw the house, he saw the wives, he saw the party... ... of course it was mange. And we know that too. He's climbing the straight wall out of ignorance. My son was such a man, why are you introducing me to him? Arsehole! I'll put the slap on you! - Why are you introducing me, son? - Look, don't. Son, why are you bringing such a man to my house? - Don't be Patience... - Listen. Son, listen to me first. Why are you bringing such a man to my house? I gave you my house out of fear of my father, I did not open my mouth. Look, we had a ton of issues, I didn't open my mouth. So this thief-looking brother called me a bastard... ... it was very difficult for me. Look, if I don't do something about it, I'll go mad tonight. I know all of them and I ask for your understanding. You calm down, just hold the veck next to you. Look, don't hold me like that, I don't like it. A minute. Mr. Sabri, Mr. Sabri. You make me feel like... so what do I know... You saw such a strange person with earrings or something... ...we are the children of Fikirtepe so-- What the hell are you saying? Shoot it. Hit.
