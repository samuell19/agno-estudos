The RCMP has announced that four First Nations women have been reported as missing. This comes after an uproar from the native community. And with the chill fall upon us, so is pumpkin picking. Hi, Sweets. Hey. I made spaghetti, the one with the basil bits in it. Thanks, I'm not super hungry. I'm going to fix it up. Suppose you walk into a baseball field, and what teams are playing? I dunno. Then, what are you doing with that baseball field? I dunno, you got me in, now get me out. Look, what is the first thing you buy in a baseball field? -A hotdog? -A hotdog. Without mustard? Mmm-mmm. Mustard goes with a hotdog. Not with mine. Mustard was made for the hotdog. Look, I don't like mustard. Mustard and the hotdog go together.

Oh yeah, I wouldn't miss it for the world. Don't be smart. So, what? They saw something they wanted, and they took it. Now, do you think that's part of our human condition, human nature, or do you think that we're socially and culturally raised with the desire for power and a want to dominate? Come on, guys, think; in your daily lives, when you were a kid on the playground, did you have territories? Did you have urges to command? Did someone's mom make a lunch that your mom would never make, and did you want to take it? Did Suzy have that Fruit Roll-Up you wanted so desperately? I don't think we're naturally inclined to have those desires. Thank you, Jackie An opinion. Yeah, I think there were a few people with greed, but originally, it was just about branching out, connecting with others to see a world outside their own. Interesting, but how do you explain centuries of war, rape, and domination? I'm going to leave you on that. By next week, I want 1,500 words on imperialism and recurring themes in history. You have the rest of the class for brainstorming and research. Use your time wisely. What a bore. Jackie. Miss Murphy, would you please do some work this period? Morning, buddy.

Ellen, you don't need to lose 12 pounds. You know who does? Becky Rogers. True. You guys are mean, her family's messed up. What does that have to do with it? She's chunky. Yo Mary, you touched Shawn's bone yet? You slut. Get bent, don't act like you're all innocent. Yeah, Amber, come on, spill it. I don't kiss and tell. Since when? Nick. Nick who? Frigging Gallagher?

But never before have we faced such a crisis. There is total collapse of our thoughts. We're in deep trouble, we all know that. The question is, how do we tackle the problem? How do we save ourselves now? And that's why we've come to Buonavista, to talk to the people who's livelihoods depend on the system. Welcome to Mackey Elementary School, where hundreds of people have joined us today for a special public forum on the state of our fisheries. We have fishermen, plant workers, plant owners... Miss Dunphy. Nice work. What were you doing the other day? What do you mean, when? At lunch? I saw you through the window. You were standing there, watching me.

No. Guy just set me up on a date with a tart. Really? Yeah. He sent me up on a date, got there, girl was a skank. I don't want nothing to do with that. That guy's a pig. Well, that's not nice, Dennis. How do you know, did you even talk to her? I know, 'cause I looked at her. Wearing a skirt up so high, I'm looking at her panties, peekin' out. Talking to every man in the place, like she's ready to friggin' give it away. Yeah, all right, Dennis. And some dirty slut. I get it, Dennis, drop it. Do you want another pancake? Yeah, please. You really are an asshole, bud. Hey! Hey! Unbelievable, man. Are you the boss? Dennis. What on earth are ya doin'? My office, now. I'm trying hard to understand you, Dennis, but you're making a difficult. Yeah, I don't know, I saw that the can was already open, so I figured that I would just, I dunno. Sorry. Dennis, I'm not an idiot. I like ya, I really do, but sometimes, I think there's something wrong with you. You just daze out. You know, it's not normal. Yeah, I don't understand it, either. I feel really weird. Pretty depressed right now. Just watch yourself. I'm gonna have to write you up as a lesson to the others. You stay there while I write. You're going to have to sign it. Pardon? Nothin'. All right, then There. Try this one. Where's the rest of it? What do you mean, that's it. Just put it on, you're gonna thank me. My whole stomach is showing. Well, obviously have to put on pants. See, that's perfect. Damn, you have a body like that and you never show it? Your nuts, I wish I had your tits. No you don't. Are you kidding me? But I do got this ass and these lips. I'll let you hold onto it for a bit. 'Kay. I'll see you tomorrow. You gonna hitch? Nah, I wanna walk. This is what separates you and me. Thanks for the top. I'm gonna want it back eventually. Sure. Thought that might be you. Hi. Ya didn't recognize my car? Nope. What ya doin'? Goin' home. Come get a drink. Maybe. I dunno, I might be busy.

Becky, you take Jackie's song. And what teacher do you have a semester? Mr. McKenzie for social sciences. Mmm, he sucks. He's nice. No, he failed me. He actually sucks. My sister told me that you made choir. Yeah. I can see you as a singer. I'm gonna quit. Yeah? Yeah, it's dumb. Well, I thought it was pretty cool. Was gonna come watch you. Oh. Yeah. It'd be nice to see you. You don't come out that much. I see Amber all the time. I can come out more. You sure? I'm not going to lend you any more money. I'm sorry. Why the hell not? Marriage is a partnership, remember? Fred, you're hurting me, please. My arm. Why won't you lend me the money? Tell me, huh? Tell me. You know why. That money is only have left. It's the only security I've got. What about me? Am I not security enough for you? You're trying to tell me I can't take care of my own wife? Please. Help me. Hey, Den? I'm bleeding. Get me loose. Den? Please. Hi, Dennis. Hi. You look nice. Thanks. Put some music on. Louder. Perfect. Have you been waiting for me? Yeah. I thought so. Dennis, did you get hard the other night? What? The other night, while watching that woman? I could've sworn I saw something. I dunno. Sure. You can play dumb, but I just want to ask you a question, because I think you're kind of full of shit. If you could do anything to me, what would you do? I'd take you out and show you a good time. Unlikely. No, we'd have a laugh. Grow up, Dennis. We both know that wouldn't happen. I'm asking what you would do to me. I'd undress you. Mmm, that's it? Don't get shy on me. Tell me what you would do. I don't know. Oh, Dennis, don't be such a baby. I know how you like it, so just say it. I'd. You'd what? I'd, I'd, Please don't stutter. Take my hair in your hand? Take your hair in my hand, and I'd-- And? I'd, Say it. I'd throw ya to your knees, and I'd grab you so hard, I couldn't even feel my fingertips. You are being bad tonight. So are you. Got a ride for me? Thank you. Just keep going straight down here for a while. Couple of minutes, or so, just past the store. Which one? Huh? Which store? When we're there, I'll say. There, there, this is fine.

Oh, there is? It's okay. Thanks for the ride. -See ya around. -Bye. Dude, what the hell took you so long? We were out. I thought you were out with Nick tonight. I was, but now I'm here. I obviously want to circle back to what just happened, but I had the creepiest ride tonight. What? Makes me shudder to think about it. What happened? Such a freak. He tried to grab my boob. You're joking. No. He was such a loser. I just told him to stick it, and then he shut right up. Do you know him? No, I've never seen him, probably some townie. But like, whatever, but like whatever, he's just trying to cop feel he can't get elsewhere. I want to listen to his tape nick made me. Ooh, a tape? Yeah, I got him around my finger. Yeah, what else he got him around? Or, should I say, he's got you around? Jackie, screw off. Shit. What's wrong with her? Nothing, she's fine, she just drunk. She don't look okay. Help me roll her over. Pass me the phone. 911, what's your emergency? I need an ambulance, 410 Black Creek. And what the nature of your call? It's my aunt, she's not moving. Okay, I'm sending them, but I want you to stay on the line until the ambulance gets there. Okay, thank you. Can I have your name? Jackie Dunphy. All right, Jackie. Can you tell me every time she takes a breath? Uh-huh. It's okay. Okay. Well, it was nice meeting you. Miss Dunphy? She's all right, she's just resting. Are you aware of your Aunt's drinking? Yes. She's got acute hepatitis. Have you heard this before? No. She's had too much alcohol in her system for too long, which caused her to have severe pain. I don't know what that means. Her organs can't take it anymore. She's going to be released tonight, we'll give her something to help with the pain, but she needs help. -Okay. -You can just wait here for her. Hey. 'Bout time. It's four in the morning, took me a minute. Maybe don't call me this late if you're gonna want me to pick up-- Sorry. Jackie. Ms. O'Brien, I was hoping we could chat. All right, maybe after rehearsal today? I have to finish setting up. Wait, it's about choir, I want to rejoin. I made a mistake. It's a little late for second thoughts. We compete next week. I know, but I can make it up. You know how fast I can learn. It wouldn't be fair to the other girls. You're a talent, but it comes a time when you have to honor your commitment, and you didn't. I'm sorry. You can try again next year. Can I get you something else? Yeah, coffee please. All right. Thanks for inviting me. Of course, glad to have ya. Oh, I meant to tell you last time.

Okay. What were you doing? Nothing. Why am I in here? You just needed some rest. Jackie, nothing happened. I mean, it's fine Jackie. Where are you gonna go? I'm leaving. Hey. What's wrong? Nothing, I'm leaving. Why, what's wrong? 'Cause I need to get out of here. Why? The night's still goin' down. You were asleep. No, I was just resting, don't go. Nick's going out for more booze. No, I want to go home. What happened to you? -Nothing. -What, tell me. Nothing. Tell me. Don, I don't know. Donovan? What'd he do? I'm, like, messed up. Yeah? Honey, what'd you expect? You to have him playing footsies forever now. What? I mean, you can't shove your tits in a guy's face and give him eyes like that, and expect him to not like, you know. Know what? I mean, you kind of owe him at that point. They get blue balls and shit, it's super painful. Get fucked. For real? No. No. No. Dennis, no. No. Dennis, no. No. You're up. Den? I'll be dead all ready.

Come on. Drive that fruit's head. Fuck you. Me? I'm not the problem, Dennis. Fuck you. With or without me, you're a failure. No, I'm not. Just ask her. You're soft like spaghetti. And her. You're a sad excuse for a man. No, wake up, fuck. See? You're weak. No, shut the fuck up. No, I'm not. No, I'm not. We made it so easy for you. Fucking God. And you blew it, over and over and over, Dennis. You're pathetic, Dennis. And you'll always fail. This fucking life. No, I won't. So, what on earth are you going to do about it? I'll show you. Can I get a ride up the road? Turns out I'm goin' that way. Okay. You know what? I used to want to be a part of it. Part of what? The world. But I don't want to anymore. Can I tell you something? I'm not sure if anyone ever really knows where they're going. You just find yourself ending up someplace, not quite sure how it happened. It's cruel, but that's the way it is. I guess it's what you do next that really matters. Are you real? I hope so.
