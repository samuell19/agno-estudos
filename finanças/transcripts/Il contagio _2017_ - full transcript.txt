Believe me, not everyone's capable of expressing beauty and grace. But you were. And the trace of your body will never fade. The outside isn't great, but the entrance is bright. And it's only up two flights of stairs. Here we are. Wait here, I'll open the shutters. - Do you work with Gianfranco? - Yes. I'm doing a TV programme with him. But I want to work in films. Sure, films are something else. - Isn't she pretty? - Real pretty! I'm glad you brought your wife. It's Simona, right? It's a good 100 square meters. There's a real sense of luxury, you have to admit that! Here are the three alcoves. Alcoves? And three bathrooms so no fights in the mornings. - Three bathrooms? - That's right! Why three bathrooms? There's two of us! Don't you worry! The last landlord knocked down two partition walls and joined three flats. This is a great living space! Gianfranco, I like it. As you saw, she's nuts about it. - So what's the deal? - This is the situation. The rent is fixed at 70 euros per month. That's peanuts! The payments will continue to be 35 euros for the two flats that are rented, but nothing for the third. - Why's that? - It doesn't appear on the inventory. Back then the Social Housing Project didn't register it. You know how it is... The rent is cheap. - But you'll give me something. - Sure, of course. - Shall we say 20,000? - 20,000? That much? But then you're sorted. I was thinking less than that. - This is a mansion, don't you see? - I do! We'll think about it and let you know. You've got my number. I'm staying to fix a few things. TAINTED SOULS Look at this lovely view. I got lipstick on you! Good morning. Bruno! Where have you been? I called you. Wait, I left my cell phone in the car. Watch out, it's wet. Thanks. Hey! What're you doin'? This lot are here again! Come on, scram! Get out of here! Move it! What the fuck... Attilio, what're you doin'? Nothing. My mom chucked something out by mistake. - Didn't you get redundancy payment? - That didn't last long! With my wife, my daughter, road tax, insurance. It lasted a couple of days. Attilio, come on up, dinner's ready! Comin', mom! Listen, can you spare anything, just a little hit... I wish! Did you pay for that... Me? We got it together! This is a bad moment for me... - I'm gonna get cigarettes. - Attilio! Attilio! Can't you hear your mom callin' you? I heard, I'm comin'. Holy Mary! - What was I sayin'? - Dunno. You've been talkin' for hours, my head hurts. Oh, yes! Bruno can't go to the stadium anymore. - He has to watch the matches at home. - He'll be pissed off! He's been barred. Roma FC is all that's on my mind! My heart beats for you! - Flaminia, ain't lunch ready? - Yeah, it's comin'. The match is starting. Start cooking, please! Okay, turn the gas on, I'm comin'. The doctors told him. - Split personality. - Really? I mean, if we're talkin' about two or three personalities, you think: "Okay, I can handle it." But five or six... that's out of the question! He'll drive you insane! Or to my death! - Luckily he's young and a good lover. - Not that old chestnut again! I'll WhatsApp you later. Yeah, I'd better go. Bye. Bruno! Hi. Hi. Hey, Gnasher! Don't call him that or he'll stop responding. His name's Jago, call him Jago. Have you been out, Gnasher? Are you gonna eat cakes? I made roast potatoes, you'll spoil your appetite. Did you hear what I said? I'll eat the potatoes tomorrow. They're good. I even used rosemary. I didn't eat at the canteen today at work. I went out for lunch with my colleagues. - Did you see how sunny it was? - Real sunny! When I got back, I heard that... there might be a security guard job opening. I'll tell Bruno, he might be interested. Bruno? I was thinking of you. Did you hear me? I was thinking of you. I don't want no cop's job! - Where are you goin'? - To the gym! - At this time? - I was busy earlier. Doin' what? What the fuck d'you do? What's up with you? What d'you want? Marcello... - Hey, Richetto. - Hey, Marcello. What're you up to? What d'you think? - What's up? - Guess. - What is it? - Your sister pissed me off. You know she's a pain in the ass. Are you off to the gym? Dunno... No, I don't feel like it now! Have you got anythin'? Come on, Marcello! What's the problem? Just somethin' for tonight. - You'll get me in trouble. - I'll pay him for that stuff. Good, start paying him back then. All right, take mine. - Thanks, Richetto. - Later, Marcello! - Take care... - I will. Who is it? It's me, open up. Marcello... Come in. No! Did you bring this too? Yes, I like it. Plus we've got the space here. How much do you like this house? I love it! If you knew what I did to get it... I think we should have a big party right away. We don't even have any chairs. Nothing grand, just a little housewarming party. We'll invite a few friends, and some neighbors. I'll put up a leaflet downstairs. If anyone wants to come... - When would this party be? - One of these days. Let's say Saturday. Saturday it is then. Okay, I'll write the invitation and put it up. She said that... Cicci's going to Ischia. Ischia? Ischia must be so cool at this time of year. And it's all paid for! She laps it all up. How can you say that? Can't see you the state she's in, poor woman! Poor woman? With the excuse that she's in a wheelchair, she's been on loads of holidays. Valeria, what are you doin'? D'you wanna poison us? I'm doin' the cleaning. You clean there, but dirty here. They've got nothin' to do all day. Take no notice! Well, I went to talk to them, and they said: "Madam, we're sorry, but as we spent money buying CCTV we no longer need a porter service now. If cleaning jobs in the block aren't enough, I'll try asking at my party office too. Thanks, poppet, but I can't manage anymore. I've got sciatica. It feels like a dog's gnawing at my kidneys. You know what my mum used to say when I was down? "You can have anything in life, just don't moan and keep fighting. If you keep moaning, I'll open the window, chuck you out... then jump out after you!" But then in the end... she didn't chuck her out. That's right! You see? You nutcase! - Come here. - Why are you here? I remembered you were getting out today. - Thanks. - Good to see you! - Let's go. - Where? Does it matter? Would you rather stay here? Do you think I'm made of money? You keep asking... Is this what you did with your father? I was even worse with him! Whenever he saw me, he'd get a fright. He knew I'd ask for money. Don't count on me. I'm not your father. I've been unlucky in life. That won't work. - I'm depressed, really. - Is that so? I'm bipolar. That's something I told you, but I was kidding. With all the money I give you... I could pay plenty of escorts! But I'm me! Are all these books yours? Yes! But I haven't read them all. They look good though. But you wrote these, your name's on them. And now? - Now what? - What are you writing? A story about a boy. A 40-year-old boy, who's married. He cheats on his wife. He goes to the gym, but he canes cocaine. He acts tough, but then he cries... when he dreams that someone kills his dog. Is there an old fart droolin' after him too? And they all lived happily ever after. Did you like it? It's lovely. It'll be great when you have kids. - Oh God, not you too! - What? Mauro's been going on about it for some time, but I... I'm not so sure. - It's wonderful, you know. - What is? - Having a kid. - Yeah, I can imagine! Tell me, how are things with Giacomo? They're letting me have more contact with him. But last year, it was his birthday, I'd managed to get authorization... They didn't let me see him. I found out they let him call them mom and dad. I said no, that's not right... because the kid has a mother. She's in jail, but he has one. I know, Marina, but that's what happens with fostering. After all, they're raising your kid. But... - Giacomo is lovely. - Really? - He's so handsome. - Little darling! - My goodness, he loves to talk! - Is he chatty? He takes after me. He tells me about school, his friends, everything. You need to toe the line. - Attilio, you should've played again. - Shut up, I've got a strategy. What the fuck! I told you. - Get change, it's all I have left. - But then we're goin'. Marcello! Come and have a shot, it's on Mamon. You still owe me from yesterday. Can I get change? Gimme a grappa. - Take this money, let's go. - What? Attilio, let's go, trouble's brewin'! - Don't fuckin' go! Have a drink! - We've gotta go, but thanks. Are they comin' after us? Yeah. Go down here. Walk faster. - Shall we run? - No, that's worse. Holy mother... So guys, how's it goin'? All good? Hi, Carmine. Well, I've had a few problems. That's why you disappeared. I was thinking: "What's happened to those two?" You're right but... I got fired, then there's my wife, alimony... Tough times. So you thought you'd try your luck on the slot machines. So with the first winnings you'd settle all your debts. Alimony for your wife, the job you've lost. The cocaine you both owe me for. I'll sort it out, don't worry, I'll pay you back. You don't answer your cell phone. I even called your house. I spoke to your mom. - She's nice. - Leave my mom out of this. - Shut up! - She's got a nice voice... - ...a young voice. - I said leave her out of this! What the fuck?! Attilio... what the fuck?! What the fuck... Carmine... if you kill them, they'll never pay you back. Hey! Shit, my leg! Get out of here, quick. Go on! That bastard broke my leg! Ice it, or it'll swell. Let it swell! What the hell happened? Nothing. Come on... - You got beaten up. - No, I walked into a pole. - Why did you come here? - I shouldn't have fuckin' come. Marcello... I'm way too nice, I never hurt anybody. Me and my friend owe a guy money. What guy? A guy you don't wanna mess with. Why? For coke? How much do you owe him? My part alone is 2,000 euros. If you pay him... this'll be over? - Why do I do this? - I'll give you the money. - Where is he? - That's for me to know. No... If you want the money, I'm coming. No, they're no good for you. What are you saying? That you're good for me? - I'm going home! - Enough now! Stop overreacting! You watch too many films! Shut your mouth! You're still going on? What the fuck are you cryin' about? Quit crying! Marcello? What the fuck happened to him? Let's go, Jago. Come on, Jago. Gnasher!

Who knows... - Not even you know. - No, I just feel a bit... useless. - Says who? - Nobody. But this thing I'm doing for you and Carmine, being a figurehead... because, let's be honest, that's what I am, a figurehead... - That's what I've become. - But it's an important role. I know, but it doesn't feel right. What did I study for, to be a figurehead? If you don't wanna do it, just say so. It's not a problem. No, I'm happy to help you. So what're you worryin' about then? Nothing, you're right. Forget it. Come on, chin up! Did you see the state of him? Yes, I did. - What happened? He's limpin'. - Nothing! What d'you think happened? He fell off his moped. He was less of a hazard when he was a toddler. Valeria, all men are the same. Yeah, you're right. It was nice of Simona and her husband to invite us to their party. They've already asked me if I'll do their cleaning. Look, it's on sale. Quit buyin' all this stuff! If a war breaks out, we'll survive a whole year! The shopping comes out of my pension. So I'll decide what we're buyin'. You just push the trolley, it's heavy. I feel like a dog's gnawing at my kidneys. She's looking rough! Come on, poor girl. She's got problems. I know what her problem is. Her husband's a poof. - Mom! - Come on, Valeria! So, what's up? We're gossipin' about Simona and her husband. My God, they ain't moved in yet and you're already yappin'! You're a true porter's wife! Okay, they're inside. Put it in here. Give it to me. What're you doin'? Give it to me, I'll go. I'll go. We run away together to a hotel near the station. Marcello starts laying out the coke, master of history and design, that erases the imperfections of time and bestows our gestures a strange solemnity. I wait silently, I look at him. People love to say that his physique is fake, that it's all liquids, his muscles were soft, well-designed but flaccid when touched. Yet here lies the miracle of his softness, of his redeeming himself as the light changes. I catch new glimpses of... ...the landscape of his back, of his aircraft-carrier shoulders. He never tires of changing position, he sinks his face in, his profile disappears... then resurfaces. His waist is as slim as that of an 18-year-old girl. Prior to penetration the meadow of intimacy unfolds, with the secret pleasures of innocence, the joy of imagining the same things, at the same time. Then... that which has to happen happens. I look at his face as he abandons himself, his tongue hanging out, folded forward, with his childish pout... My finale is so intense that he starts to laugh. And I think how wonderful it would be to have a child with him. There is no evil. Peace... comes knocking when it wants. Chiara? What are you doing? I just had a hot flush. We don't have air-con here. We've had a new air-con unit installed. - A new one? - Yes, it was a gift. Lucky are those who are blessed! - Just go watch the match. - What're you sayin'? Ultras love to fight. If one of your mates gets attacked, you've gotta fight back. They made a big deal the other day over some cop, but if a guy had died, they'd have kept schtum. - The cops shoot straight at people. - Bastards! They abuse their power. They did it with me too. When they came to my house, you wouldn't believe what they did. I had a lump of hash. They found it, he went to the bathroom, flushed the toilet, pretending to get rid of it then he pocketed it. I said to him: "Listen, by any chance did you..." Guess what he did? In front of my wife! - Flaminia! - Yes, he got physical with him. He put his hands round my neck. Then he said: "Don't fucking contradict me! I chucked it, so shut your gob!" Then he handcuffed me. - Hi. Don't you say hello now? - Hi. - Where's Marcello? - Dunno. Who knows? Good to see you out! You shouldn't stay in all the time. You only come out when free drinks are involved. - I work with Mauro! - Nice work that you do! I earn more than you. Good, keep it for your lawyer's fees! Dammit, charming as ever! Cheers! Hi, Marina. - How are you? - Fine. - Sorry we're late. - All the food's gone now... That's not true. There's plenty. - Good evening. - Hello, I'm Valeria Spampinato. How about askin' her to join the cooperative? You mean Marina? Ain't she lookin' for work? - Who's this handsome young man? - This is Giacomo, my son. How lovely, Giacomo! Here, have some food and go keep Grazia's daughter company, she's got one of those electronic gadgets! Go on. Sit down! How lovely! How old is he? Twelve. This house is beautiful. And now it belongs to this couple who are so lovely. Clean. - Not like the previous tenants. - Meaning? You can't imagine what I found here. Once there was pasta stuck to the wall. - How gross! - Food was strewn all over the house. And the bath tub was full of butts. And under the bed... I found... - I can't tell you. - Go on! - Valeria! - Don't beat around the bush. A rubber one. Black rubber. I picked it up, I disinfested it with bleach then I put it in the underwear drawer. Didn't you have a go? Hi. Hi. Simona, right? - Yes. - I'm Marcello. We met on the stairs. Yes, I remember. I brought a friend, is that okay? He's a professor. No problem. - Walter. - Simona. Come in. You're just in time for the cake, - Thanks. Hello! - Hi, Marcello. - Where have you been? - Here and there. I'll rip the Lazio fans' guts out. 'Cause when we're there, all doped-up, nothin' else matters. You give beatings and take beatings. But all outside. Not inside the stadium. It ain't about the score. Roma might even lose 3-0, but I don't give a shit. I'll have ripped the Lazio fan's guts out by then. I ain't getting revenge 'cause we lost. That'd be shameful. I even ended up on TV. They filmed me beatin' people with bricks, with sticks, and hackin' a jeep with an angle grinder. That's how I get my kicks. At one point I go nuts. I don't give a fuckin' shit. How's it goin'? The swelling's goin' down. I heard you've sorted it. Yeah. Next time you need somethin', ask me. Why are you helpin' me? Mauro, we're making a toast to the new house, we need you! Of course! Let's make a toast! Let's all make a toast! To Mauro and Simona! - Mom? - What? - Come quickly! - What is it? Come and have a look! Attilio, I've got to start making lunch. Come on, mom, do that later. What is it? What's happened? Take a look at this. What's this? Is it for me? I dunno. I found it here. Maybe. Shall I open it? Would you rather wait for Christmas? - What's inside? - Open it! Are you nuts? Hurry up and open it! But we can't afford this... A fur coat? Is it wolf? Don't you like wolf fur? No... Yes, I do! - How much did it cost? - I can't tell you, it's a gift. I know, it's not the right season. But when I saw it, I thought of you, mom. Where did you get the money? You always talk about money! I've found a job. Are you involved in something dodgy? Something dodgy? I'm doin' business with a mate. From today, things are going to change. Come on, try this on. Let's see how it looks. Here. Come here. Goddammit! Everyone will envy you! My treasure! A wolf fur coat! So, is it all clear? Any questions? It's all good. A nice venture. Is it above board? Do you think we'd get you involved in something risky? Mauro, you tell her. She trusts you. Sorry, I'm not saying I don't trust you. Ours is a transparent venture, with the Council's authorization. What do I have to do? You're the treasurer, right? We'll bring you the balance sheet every month and you just sign it. All right. - Is construction involved? - Yes. - What do you care? - You're part of the rehabilitation project. - Exactly... - You know why I'm nervous? - They could stop me seeing my son. - Don't worry. You heard what Mauro said. - Mauro, get the contracts. - Okay. Where are you two from? No, don't worry about them, they've just arrived from... from Poland, I believe. They don't speak Italian. - Here, one each. - I'll hand them out. - Welcome to Renova! - Here. What do I put? - Marina, sign on the dotted line! - Yes, I'll help her. Just sign here. Hi, Marcello... - I'm sorry, I didn't know... - Marcello's out. He told me to come round... Because I wasn't supposed to be here. But I am... and he's not. He must've forgotten. - Okay, well... - Don't go. Sit down. I don't want to be a bother. You're not! I'll make you a coffee. Dammit, you've got crooked feet! I'm tired, Flaminia tired me out. If I don't shag her twice a night, she won't let me sleep. Twice... Plus it's her time of the month. When women are on their period, they're ravenous. Now we'll have fun. Play with us, come on. - What's up? - I fell off my moped the other day. My leg hurts! I can't play. He beat you up and you play football with him... Fuck you! When Chiara's got hers, she's unbearable. Plus, it's gross... - Simona makes me wear a condom. - Condoms don't agree with me. By the time I've put it on, I've gone limp. You're gettin' that! Learn how to kick a ball! Elvis! Over here! - Will you stop sulkin'? - He's a bastard. - If it weren't for him, the other day... - You go play with him! Go on! How are things? How's work? Good. How about you? I'm a bit tired. - Do you work a lot? - Recently, yes. I'm writing my new novel. Nice! Must be nice to do what you do. Not like my job! I wasn't feeling well today. I called in sick. I'm sorry. I'm used to it. Coffee's ready. Marcello doesn't do anything. You know what Marcello's like. He lives for the gym. - Is that considered work? - It could be. He also has that idea for the shop. He's been talking about that for two years, professor. Those supplements, that stuff that he takes... I no longer believe him. Just pretend. To do what? To believe him. Then what? Then over time he'll end up believing too. I don't think that's how it works. I no longer believe in anything. Do you believe in God? By nature, no. By nature, no! - What about you, do you? - I used to. I was raised by nuns, so you can imagine. But I don't think God exists. Once a clairvoyant told me there is no God, only a great mother. I've seen her. Really? What was she like? She was beautiful. She had fair skin, blue eyes. The first time I saw her, I was a kid. They'd dunked me in ice cold water to rid me of the evil eye and she was beside me. I didn't know it was her. You think I'm mad, don't you? Not at all! You're a woman of great sensibility. - You mean I'm gullible. - No, all the opposite. Don't worry, my mom always used to say: "Chiara, you're gullible." But it wasn't my fault. She was full of shit. What could I do? I was a kid... We never stop believing in something. No, I stopped. My mother met a guy. He said to her: "I'll marry you, just get rid of that pain in the ass." I was that pain in the ass. That's what they called me. Then they sent me to boarding school. They even had a kid together. Richetto, Marcello's mate. They're always together. They get on. What about your mother? Didn't you see her again? Last time was when they dropped me off at boarding school. We were hugging... then a nun arrived... She did something with her hand... Here he is, he's back. I forgot my keys, dammit! Always the same story... Walter, I forgot about you too. Dammit! Don't worry, I should've known. Thanks, Chiara. So you're bringin' him home now? I have no words! - So don't say anythin' then. - You're the one who should shut up! Okay, I will then. The gym? D'you think I'm an idiot? I was at the gym with Mauro! You've got a new playmate now? Listen, give me a break! I saw that Mauro yesterday! He looks like a right fucker! I bet if you gave him shit to eat, he'd say: "Wow, how delicious!" Marcello, go fuck yourself! You parasite... and those friends of yours! Shut your mouth! You benefit from my friends too! You even brought him home! Attilio? Is that for you? Attilio, someone's at the door! These are friends of yours. At this time of night! I'll show them! This is no time for visitors. Goddamn wretches, I'll show you! - Police, ma'am. - What's going on? - Check in there. - What are you here for? - There he is! - What are you after? - Calm down, ma'am. - What the hell d'you want? - Take him away. - I've done fuck all! Shut your mouth! Take him away! Calm down! Call the lawyer, mum! Call the lawyer! Call the lawyer, mum! I was born here. I've known Chiara ever since we were kids. Really? I didn't see a girl until I was 16. Really? So you and Chiara have always been in love? Dunno, we've always been together so we got married. Before I met Simona I got up to all sorts. Then she came along and... I fell in love. And before that? I was with a girl... Lucrezia. What a fuckin' name! A right bitch! Once I had a motorbike accident. Basically... to cut a long story short, while I was in hospital, doing physio and all that stuff, she screwed another guy. Dammit! She even had the front to visit me in hospital. I chased her round the ward in my wheelchair! I went nuts! Three people had to hold me back. I was fuckin' furious! Then in hospital I met Amedeo. They called him the Count, he was loaded. He taught me how to do all the wrong stuff. Coke, dealin'... orgies... We had some right gangbangs! Chiara wants to have a kid. Sorry! I'll stop! We thought she was the problem. You know she's not very well, right? We visited 200 doctors. I even said to her: "Let's adopt a Chink". They are plenty of them! She doesn't believe that it's me who can't have kids. She says the doctors don't understand jack shit. She's stubborn, right? Yes. But she's nice. - I'm the son of a bitch. - No! Why are you puttin' yourself down? Damn you! Dammit, dawn's beautiful from here! The thought of seeing him once again behind that glass... I can't bear it. Who says you have to go? - Maybe we'll go. - Right. You prepare a bag for him, so he'll have something to wear. A bag... Okay, Valeria? Did you speak to the lawyer? We spoke earlier... But anyway... I'll come by early tomorrow, I'll pick up the bag and take it to him. Now go get some rest. We'll see you tomorrow morning. I'll come by round 8:00, okay? Don't worry. The bag... My treasure... The fur coat... Some food.... What food should I bring him? I'll heat this up for him. THREE YEARS LATER Dead time becomes dilated for Mauro, especially in the afternoons. After the banks have closed, he has time to go jogging round the centre, where he now lives. Mauro is bored. He feels like those astronauts who go out of the spaceship to repair a fault, like he's floating in mid-air. At night it's like a bomb has exploded. No one shouts, no one breathes... Simona doesn't like the reflection she sees in the mirror. But she continues to believe in goodwill and that the glass is half full. Mauro admires who dares and wins, those who find parking spaces right away, but that's a state of grace to which one cannot aspire. He has to find his own fortune. Here it is. Look. October 27th, a payment to your cooperative's account has not been accounted for. You know that as a bank everything must be accounted for. - Plus, with the new rules... - Can I speak to the manager? I'm in charge of dealing with these matters... Call the manager! Wait a moment, please. Mr. Flamini, how are you? - Fine. - What's the problem? Look. Here. That's nothing. We're inconveniencing a trusted client like Mr. Flamini for 2,000 euros? - But... - 2,000 euros! Mr. Flamini, come with me, we'll sort this out right away. Hi. Oh, hi! Hi. Sorry, I didn't hear you. - Are you going out again? - Yes, I'll have a shower first. To do something for Carmine. He sees you almost more than I do. Will you be home for dinner? No. I won't be back in time. I can't stand seeing you like this. You're always anxious, tense. I'm going to work, not to have fun. But you're always on edge. You're working, you're making money... What do you know? I don't mind you seeing your friends. What friends, Simona? What friends? Listen why don't we have a baby? Whatever! For the outside, I thought of putting a reception desk there... - What do you think? - Okay. Perhaps we need some lighting for the pathway. That's no problem! I'm slightly worried about the weather forecast. But most of the party will be inside, so... Will three weeks be enough? Of course! - My reputation's at stake! - Don't worry, leave it to me. Who's that? Is he nuts? Excuse me! Listen... You see... he looks like a dog I had. - I see. - He's exactly like him. You don't need to explain, we were just admiring you. - Go ahead, if you like. - No, no... How do you do, I'm Mauro Flamini. Oh, it's you! We get to meet in person at last. I'm Lucia Della Rocca. Nice to meet you, ma'am. - Hello. - Good morning. Giovanni, can we have a minute? - Of course, I'll be inside. - Thanks. You have no idea how important this event is for me. I'm so pleased to be working with you. Same here. Because nowadays everyone loves to talk about solidarity... but when it comes to it, who's actually doing anything? - Who is? - No one! - Of course! - It's all talk and no action. At Renova we're committed to offering hospitality to immigrants. With the funding from the Council we'll have the necessary resources to accommodate asylum seekers. Actions, not words! Shall we go inside? This way! But if Salvarini doesn't get us the Council's approval, we're screwed. - He's stealing our money. - No! That's not true. Let's just say that... maybe he's a bit distracted, he forgot who put him there. Carmine, sorry. Can I have a word? Please, it's important. - I need to ask you a favor. - Go ahead. I need a loan. My sister's ill. I'm sorry. She's on a waiting list for an operation, but it's a long one. She's ill, we need to find another solution. Tell me what you need! 30,000 euros. It's serious, otherwise I wouldn't be asking. Mauro's helping me too. How much do I give you a month? You've got the money! Work hard, put some money aside and everything will be fine. Chin up. Now let's focus on this stupid charity gala, the refugee centre for the immigrants. We'll put them in there, take the money then disappear. But then we have to focus on this project with the Bulgarians. So Salvarini, and the Council, mustn't bust our balls because I don't want to lose face with the Bulgarians. Guys, America ain't the answer! It used to be! Russia, Bulgaria! That's where the money is now. Really. Get some glasses. - So, is it a deal? - Of course! We'll do a good job. Where are you going? Ain't you gonna drink with us? I don't like spumante. This ain't spumante. To the Bulgarians! And to the refugees! Thanks! Oh God, Mauro, sorry I'm late! - Good morning. - You can say many things about me, but I'm never late. - You are today though. - Forgive me, coffee's on me. - Can we be on first name terms now? - All right. Giulia, two coffees please. Regular coffee? One regular, one barley please. So, Mauro, I gave an architect friend of mine the project for the centre. He'll make a nice model that we'll place in the centre of the hall. So all the guests at the event will be able to actually see what they'll be funding. - Good idea, don't you think? - Yes, nice idea. Plus I've always been into model-making! - Your accent tells me you're Roman. - Yes, I've not lost it. What area are you from? Right now I'm in Prati, but I grew up on Via Laurentina. Via Laurentina... Laurentino 38 district. Of course! That wasn't bad as an idea! - All those walkways... - Lovely walkways! You know they want to knock those blocks down? They want to build an eco-friendly walkway. - Fuksas-style. - Cool... Your coffee. Thanks, Giulia. So where are you from? I can't tell. I grew up between Milan and... It's too complicated to explain. I'd need an entire evening to tell you my story. Will one evening be enough? Perhaps. But you're paying. All right. I like this role reversal thing. Hi, Mauro. You managed to make money, damn you! Good for you. I'm in the shit. This time I'm in deep shit. I left that place too, you know. I moved away. Now we're renting a house next to the hospital, so that Chiara... So it's easier for Chiara. Last year she spent... more time there than at home. They've all ditched me, even Walter. If she leaves me too, what'll I do? I'm scared of endin' up alone. What am I gonna do, Mauro? You tell me. I need loads of money. I don't know who to ask anymore. I don't know what the fuck to do, Mauro. I'm scared. I'm talking to a door... - Hi. - Hi. - Everything okay? - Yes. Richetto! Wanna go for a drink now? I've got to do somethin'. Take the keys back to the office. Where are you off to? Wait! One moment. I need the bathroom. Nice little glass collection... - All blue. - Yes. Little frivolities... that are symbolic. They keep you company, you know, when you live alone. Yeah, but I ain't cut out for all that spiritual stuff. No, don't call it spiritual. Call it infantile, I won't mind. Right! A part of me has remained a child. Growing up wasn't easy. - You're not wrong! - I don't think I managed it very well. Well, no... I wouldn't say that. Babe! - What! - Babe! You know what? You're sexier when you shut up. So are you. Are you married? - No, why? - You've got a wedding ring. Oh, that! No, it was a gift to myself when I turned 40. I sort of married myself. - What's so funny? - What do you think? Oh God, Giovanni... Hello, Giovanni? No, don't worry, it's not a bad time. You know that I'm thinking of leavin'? Where are you gonna go? I'll move houses. I'll move away. - Why, what's wrong with here? - Nothin'... Carmine's buying some flats in Prati as offices. Nice company! I work with Carmine, he's my boss. He's a savage! He knows how to make money. If you hadn't stopped him last year, I'd be dead. He wanted to kill me over 2,000 euros. 2,000 euros! Do you realize? Forget about that. I'll make him pay though. Simona's seen a house around there. You'll fit right in, two beggars among a load of snobs! So what? I wanna move on, achieve something. I don't wanna die here. You know you can come visit me whenever you like. So you're gonna leave me here on my own. A colonel will sit at this table. Bring him whatever he wants. Don't worry, ma'am. You made it! I've been here all day. At some point I'll collapse! Good evening! You decided to wear a shirt. Do I look good? You look fuckin' hot. Get lost! You'd better get lost. There's Ludovica! What'll you do if I don't? Hi! - Did you see him? - Who? Oh, is that him? Handsome, eh? He's turned me into a silly teenager. I'm keeping a diary of how many times we've screwed. Let's hurry up. Here's the most chivalrous man I know, the president of Renova, without him, none of us would be here tonight. Carmine D'Antonio, nice to meet you. The pleasure is mine. Great project. This congressman is one of our most important sponsors. Then I'll take this opportunity, sir, to introduce you to my partner, Mr. Flamini, and two Bulgarian friends, with whom I'm collaborating on an important project. - What kind of project? - Children's homes for vulnerable Italian and Bulgarian children and teenagers. Say no more. Lucia, send me a detailed report on Monday. Of course. Okay! Valerio, can you come here? Shall we commemorate this moment with a photo? Any sign of Richetto? No. Turn on the light. This damn helmet is too tight! Open it. I'm trying. Fuckin' hell! My God! And at last it's the moment we've all been waiting for, to find out about this wonderful project. Of course this event wouldn't have been possible without the input of certain extraordinary people. People who have made social enterprise their goal in life. And so I would like to thank these people, starting with Mr Carmine D'Antonio. A round of applause! And sir, we'll welcome you onto our stage later so that you can tell us about your project. And now a special round of applause for Lucia Della Rocca... who we all know and who did brilliant job organizing this extraordinary fund-raising event. Of course, in order for this event to make a real a contribution, we're asking for donations because even just one euro can make a difference. So... donate, donate, donate! And now if we're ready... three, two, one! It's beautiful, really! As you can see from the model, the reception centre that will be built with the funds raised is a cutting edge building that combines innovation and solidarity. This project is an opportunity to promote respect for others, not just theoretically, but by partaking in concrete actions. This centre was realized thanks to funding received from Rome's Council and the contribution of Councillor Salvarini, so let's give him a round of applause. Let's thank them again for having supported this venture with such enthusiasm. Let's welcome the president of Renova onto the stage who will enlighten us further on the project. Let us have a round of applause for Mr Carmine D'Antonio. Tonight I'd like to tell you a story. It's the story of a dream that came true. When we first set up Renova, three years ago... My goodness, three years already? Three years ago we were a small cooperative that was working hard to succeed because it had an objective. When we first started out, people thought we were mad. But we persevered and managed to help forgotten and marginalized people. We involved them and we helped them to become part of society again. Over the years our commitment has grown stronger, just like our desire to make a difference. And you can see that difference now, right here. This is the temporary reception centre for political refugees and asylum seekers. The centre covers over two hectares and is equipped to accommodate over 500 migrants. What mattered most to us was to make these people feel protected and safe. The enclosure you see around the structure has been designed with their safety in mind. Inside the building, all the living quarters... Stop pressuring me! You think this is goddamn simple? Things like this take time. I need more time. Look who it is. Councillor Salvarini. He came to eat. Because you love eating. Right, Councillor? You don't realize who's paying you. - If this falls through, you're screwed. - The Council doesn't work like that. Mauro, at last! I've been looking all over for you. What's going on here? What's going on? Lucia, get lost! - Get lost? - Get lost! - What do you mean "get lost"? - Just fuckin' get lost! I need a piss. Come with me, we need to talk. I sent the guys out to look for Richetto. I knew somethin' was up. Always with that fuckin' stuck-up expression. Like a badass. He even asked me for money. I sent them to the garage... and while we were at that nice party, him and his mate thought they'd surprise us. - Come here! - What the fuck do you want? "No, Carmine, I swear to you! He's a really good kid!" Are you with me, Mauro? Go! Get out of here! Run! You're responsible for this. You know that? But I'll catch him... just like we caught his mate. Get out. Come with me. Come, Mauro. Look who it is! D'you remember him? What the fuck are you doin'? Stop! Stop! They tried to screw me over! Mauro, help me! Look. Those 100 meters between him and Marcello, he'd have wanted to cross them a hundred times every second. That's when he realized that the essence of his work entailed not doing... anything, but simply obeying, in silence. Four lines on the office table, to resist until midnight. To then be besieged by cannibal dreams. With him, panting as he climbs a steep staircase seeking for... the light. Wait here. Mauro! Goddammit! - Did you get nabbed too? - Dammit! Shit, you've aged! You look like my grandpa! Who fuckin' thought I'd see you here? Attilio's on the fifth wing too. But that idiot's got another two years. The water's cold! D'you wanna freeze us to death? If you need a hand settlin' in, tell me. I know everyone here. Thanks, Bruno. How come you're in here? My wife. One day she called me on my cell phone. I said: "What's up?" No reply. I said: "What's happened? Did the cat get your tongue?" She said... "I've reported you." Bitch! Just 'cause I slapped her around! If I get my hands on her, I'll rip her to bits! Anyway... Did you hear about Marcello? They found him... tied to a tree. He was wreck lately. He'd go out with his dog, you couldn't tell which one was the dog. He stank... I reckon he needed money and did somethin' stupid. He met a nasty end. It even made the headlines. They destroyed him. They broke his bones. He was covered in bruises, it was hard to identify him. He'd asked me for money too. It was unbelievable, I was totally broke. For me now... this is Rome. Not the Pantheon or Piazza Euclide. Not the gypsum monuments you can see from the Janiculum nor the domes and bell towers that form sea-gulls from Terrazza Olivetti in Piazza Venezia. The Rome that was foreign for Marcello, that almost required a Visa, is also foreign to me now. Jago... Jago! Gnasher! I'd lived in the city for 40 years, solitarily but integrated, in my own way. Turning that city into a pile of ruins required an impossible and almost crazy desire, that Marcello inspired in me, leaving me then on the brink of that disaster, fending for myself. All I have left now are the suburbs, but the ones with no soul. Because the soul of these suburbs... was him. Believe me, not everyone's capable of expressing beauty and grace. But you were. And the trace of your body... will never fade.
