And a fight broke out between us So he started it He started it is that what you're saying No, he just took off his jacket Didn't hit me I took off my jacket and hung it up I hadn't hit him yet He took off his jacket hung it up and said You and your wife, your daughters the four of you Kicked me and hit me What the hell's the deal I hit him. He didn't hit back I don't think that's possible Yes? Who are you looking for I want to see Officer Li Officer Li Go over there Have a seat first I'll be with you in a minute What's the matter Wan Qinglai What's happened to him? He's been kicked Are you Qinglai's wife? I couldn't make it to his wedding I heard his wife was a beauty. So that's you You're having a baby! Sit down... Bruises on the right chest wall left testicle slightly swollen slightly swollen... Qinglai's such a harmless guy How'd he get in a fight? With whom With our Chief You mean Wang Shantang Yes Why We grow chilly, you know Hey, Li, I'll take this. Here You know we grow chilly, don't you Yes I do You do Well, we wanted to put up a storaged shed We got the bricks and tiles ready But the Chief kept refusing our application So instead We cleared a place by our allocated land To make room for the chilly shed But the Chief still refused claimed there was an order So I said, if you have this order Let me see it But he refused He's the order he said And he just wouldn't show it to me Mind you, there is such a document The land is for growing crops If everyone builds on it What're we going to eat But does this document say he can beat people He's the Chief A few knocks are one thing But to kick a man where it counts It takes two to start a fight He must have been provoked What's the reason? Why Why My brother was mad. He swore at him Who are you? I'm Wan Qinglai's sister What did your brother say He cursed the Chief said he'd have no heirs Said he could only raise hens Your brother was wrong then Everyone knows that the Chief only has daughters Your brother's words cut him where it hurts The family planning policy means he'll have no heirs It's cruel to remind him of it Even so, he's got no right to beat people up He's the Chief he shouldn't have kicked him there I asked him what should be done He said he's kicked, and that's that I said, if you won't do something who will You're the Chief, but you beat him It's not right You're what you're here for? Right Yes I tell you, he's wrong to have kicked your husband Course he is! And where it counts If that doesn't get better, we... All right, all right I've said he's wrong Now, go home first In the next day or two I'll come and sort things out I want both of you to do some self-criticism Is that clear Yes You go home first, I'm busy today You can leave this with me Then when will you come In the next day or two Officer Li, please come soon Goodbye, Li Goodbye now Dad, Dad Staying warm It's you, Li. Come and get warm Wang I want to talk to Wang why don't you go outside What brought you here? Good looking maize Wang I've read the medical report and been to see Qinglai He shouldn't have cursed you I've told him off But you, too were wrong You're his elder, and you're the Chief Shouldn't have beat him like that I was just following orders! But the orders don't say you can beat people up If he's any sense He should ask himself why he got kicked You're the Chief Hitting him has one thing But you shouldn't a kicked him there It shut him up, didn't it Please, please You go out first, Qiu Ju I want to talk to the Chief alone So that's how we'll settle it Qiu Ju as I see it he shouldn't have kicked your husband I've said this to his face But Qinglai's got a sharp tongue too So, both sides must admit they're wrong As mediator, here's what I think Wang should pay for Qinglai's medical costs and lost wages $200 in all, what do you think I'm not after his money I just want an explanation The Chief is obstinate but he's the head here Don't make him lose face Besides, Qinglai isn't too badly hurt That's it then He'll pay. That shows you're right and he's wrong Let's settle for that All right? That's what's we'll do Tomorrow, bring the medical bills to his place Bring a receipt with you too He'll give you the money And you can put this all behind you Chief Got the bills and the receipt Yes, they're all here That's 200 dollars in all All yours Chief, what's this What's this? You think it's so easy I'm not after your money I want justice Justice? You think I've given in It's only that Office Li came so far I can't let him lose face There are twenty 10 dollar notes there Bow your head and pick them up For each one you pick up you bow your head to me When you've done that 20 times we can call it quits I'll say when we quit I want to speak to Officer Li He's gone to the county town for a meeting For a meeting? When will he be back Not sure The thing could have been done with But he flung the money on the ground Said those terrible things I can't believe there's no justice My family is no good with words I can't go myself But it's such a long way to the county town I worry about you, in your condition Why worry? If I'm going to lose the baby just a cough will do If I'm not a rolling pin couldn't pop it out Take money with you tomorrow We don't have much cash I'll bring a cartload of chilly It's the wrong season Won't get much for them It's not the money I'm after I just want him to do right by us Meizi Be careful Don't let the chilly fall out Are those for sale? Yes How much would you pay $3.5 per catty $3.50? $4 All right, $4, is that a deal? $4? All right Meizi, unload the chillies Eleven catties in all Eleven and a half All right, eleven and a half Here's 100. 122 altogether. Yes The fare to town is 7.50 each That much There's a cheaper fare If we can get six people Then it's 2.50 each Let's go that way then The County Town When I came back from work I found the door has been pried open So I came straight here to report it those papers, what're they for Complaint letters I haven't got one You haven't? Go to the post office by the entrance Look for a guy named Zhang Tell him your case He can write the letter for you Just this way. He'll do it for you Can you help me write a letter? What sort to of letter A complaint letter How strongly worded you want it What do you mean? I could word it mildly give both of your a way out To back down if things got really rough Or I could be merciless leave no way out for him He'd be done for Oh no! Give him a chance to back down Won't cost you much then Twenty dollars will do Twenty dollars How could it be so expensive? I've helped over a dozen people win their cases Like you, they wanted mild letters Also written a total of six merciless ones The result? Four were shot The other two got life sentences I only asked for $20 It's not expensive at all All right then Good, tell me your case The Chief has four daughters Which means he's not only let his ancestors down He's also violated family planning policy He cannot have a son So he takes his frustrations out on us My husband merely commented that the Chief was raising hens But the Chief heard hens and insisted it meant his daughters For that, he kicked my husband and hurt him grievously We cannot tolerate this travesty of justice The Chief is guilty of attempted murder He must be punished to the fullest extension Who wrote this for you? I asked someone Paid $20 for it Why didn't you write it yourself? Haven't you been to school? Been through secondary school Couldn't write anything like this Officer Li has dealt with this already Why come to us Officer Li might have favored the Chief I want the county government to handle it Then leave your material with us According to Regulations of Article 39 a decision will be made on your case in five days If you find the decision unsatisfactory you can apply to a higher level for a review Within five days of receiving the decision Did you get that? What it means is You go home first, and the county Public Security Bureau gives you a decision in five days If you're still unhappy you can go to the higher-ups Those in the city P.S. B, and ask them to look into your case again Decided that the public security officer of said village should help both parties make self-criticisms All concerned should aim at achieving harmony and stability and let minor differences stand As for financial compensation the said village authorities have in the first mediation made a sound proposal for settlement Wang shantang pays the complainant's medical bills and wages lost The same as the last decision All that way to the county town for this Ha! Thought I'd get a bullet in my head Don't gloat Officer Li, is that all Get the meat first There's one other thing All right Give me the meat How much Five dollars Officer Li Come to my place for a drink and we can talk No Listen Take my advice Go and say a few kink words to Qinglai and Qiu Ju and bring an end to the whole thing Kind words How kinds? What words? Look, you must do your part I came several times just for this case You've heard the decision of the county town You won't lose face Tell me, Office Li why couldn't this have been settled here Why go to the county town to smear my name She didn't mean you harm Besides, I'm an official I've still got to run this place She didn't mean harm Just wants you to apologize Go on say a few words and she'll be pacified I'll cough up the money As for apologizing I can't see that I'm wrong There you go again Decided that the public security officer of said village should help both parties make self-criticisms All concerned should aim at achieving harmony and stability and let minor differences stand As for financial compensation the said village authorities have at the first attempt at mediation made a sound proposal for settlement Wang Shantang pays the complainant's medical bills and wage loss That's it. See what you think Isn't this the same as the last decisions? Let's eat first Meizi, set the table What're you having? Noodles That's worth good money Dad, the noodles are ready You're a busy man Haven't seen you in a while How are you? You look well I'm well. I fell fine. Qinglai, you look better Yes.

Tell me if its too bland Wang Shantang is stubborn Everyone in the village knows it He asked me to bring you these Its not easy for him to make this gesture Qiu Ju, you said you wanted him to do right Take this as an apology from him Help yourself You'll be fully compensated Your expenses paid So you haven't suffered financially Besides, this is a case for mediation Not one to be settled in court The county town made a decision and that's it Officer Li, did he really pay for this Come on Who else I spent half the day yesterday persuading him He is, after all, an officer Don't be too hard on him Sending you the snacks is his way of saying sorry to you If that's the case all's well then After all, he's the Chief what can I do to him We all live in the same village No point dragging this out The county town has made decision so be it I'm no comment Yes, if that's their decision And if that's the case Then the Chief has already apologized to us As for the money, it's not important That's your compensation he should pay for it Very well, then let's consider it settled I haven't come all this way for nothing You two go and sit at the back There's a line, don't you see There are lots of marriage applicants today Go and get in line How did you two fall in love?

Your suspicion is not unreasonable And we do make mistakes If you're really unhappy there's another option Take your case to court How Let me see I can recommend a lawyer to you He's Wu from the district lawyer's firm He's a nice man He can help you That's it then I'll be your attorney Go home now and I'll let you know I'll handle your case for you I'm busy, I won't see you off.

It's the same thing You wouldn't accept the decision of the city PSB So we must start with the city PSB We have to take it step by step before we can sue the Chief It's all part of the legal procedure I don't care. I'm only after the Chief Director Yan is a good man I can't sue him I won't. Sue him yourself We've gone so far already You must go and appear in court If you don't, what're we to do? Haven't we agreed? You'd leave everything in my hands I don't care! I'll only sue the Chief Not Director Yan Listen... Qiu Ju Director Yan Time to go in, why don't you go? I won't. I'm not going to sue you As I've explained to you This is how things stand Your Chief beat up your husband so the PSB must deal with the case The county town PSB made a decision you didn't accept Nor did you accept the city PSB's decision So no more mediation Legal action is taken as you've requested Your lawyer, on your behalf has filed a suit against the municipal PSB Why? Because you think our decision isn't just It's all part of the legal proceedings As director of the PSB I must appear in court Qiu Ju, in civil and administrative suits The defendants are not necessarily bad people You mean good people can sue each other Of course Director Yan If you lost, what would happen to you? Nothing bad would happen to me if I lost There'll just be a new attempt to examine your case And the right thing will be done Of course the right thing will be done All right, I'll go then Here comes Lawyer Wu You've bought so many things Thank you Don't mention it Qiu Ju, the way things went just now I think you stand a good chance I think you'll win How did you know? Lawyer Wu, you're the legal expert But something's I may know better The law of administrative litigation is new right with this trial a citizen suing the government the law will be publicized It's good publicity The higher-ups must be behind it If Qiu Ju loses who'll have faith in this law You've got a point I'm sure of it If so, we're sure to win Sure. If you lose Your stay is free The case has been heard by this court and has been carefully deliberated It is found that The decision of the city Public Security Bureau with regard to the plaintiff's application for a review Wan Qinglai is right and proper and should receive the full support of the court To safeguard the proper legal and administrative relationships and to protect the rights of all parties the court, in accordance with the administrative law Article 52, Paragraph 1, and Article 54, Paragraph 1 now affirms the decision of the municipal public security bureau with regard to the plaintiff's application for a review on the case of the alleged assault of Wan Qinglai If the plaintiff wishes to take the matter further She can appeal to the Intermediate People's Court within fifteen days after delivery of judgement The case is ended Qiu Ju, we've lost Lost Qiu Ju Did you understand what the judge said?
