* THE RELENTLESS FOUR * There it is. Wait, Rex. No. He'll pick us up sooner, or later Sam is a friend. No. A ranger is always a ranger. If he catches me he will hang me. We have them. We can't go on, Rex, we better wait. Tall, Rex. Better to hurry. The ranger will catch him. Motionless. Stop, Rex. Rex! Rex! Rex! Rex! Sam... he's dead. No need to run anymore, it's all over. He was not given the opportunity to prove his innocence. He pulled out a gun, didn't he? Let's go get the fee. You will receive your reward in hell. The little one has lost a little. Bring his body. He was innocent, Sam. Yes I know. You will not receive any fee. I was not chasing Rex. I followed him to allow him to prove his innocence. He was no longer wanted. What you are saying is very stupid. Whether you like it or not, we will collect the fee. They will not get a penny. You will see. Let's go. Alan, we better get back to town. If they reach the Sheriff first, we will not get anything. They will succeed, Sam. Yeah!... It's not right to get paid, Rex was never illegal. They will make it. Only if they fly. Nice day for a walk, huh? Hello. Hello, Vince. Who did you bring today? Rex Calhoun. Alive? Dead. Good. You saved us the trouble. Four hundred eighty, four hundred ninety... Five hundred. Here you go. Hey, Sam! Sam Garrett, go inside. Sheriff! I hope I arrived on time. Especially at the time, to receive. Why. To save you $ 500. Let's listen to you. The Rex they killed, it turned out, that he was innocent. It is not possible to collect the fee for the declaration. We knew nothing, Sheriff. Well, you know now. The ranger spoke. One day our paths may cross again. It's for a decent funeral, Sheriff I want to find him in front of me. Hey, come on, smile, Vince. You will get from the next one that we will bring to collect. Cursed Medellin coyote, you know I hate rangers. He will make the mistake soon. They leave. It is yours. Yeah. Since when do you have an Indian saddle? Ever since I met an Indian who had a horse but no smoke. Come on, my son. Let me find you a job. See you, Sam. Hey, can't you see where you're going Mr.? Would you like me to say "sorry"? Apologize immediately. I want to hear it. Come on, say it! Wait, Troy. Well, Ranger, you are unlucky. The boys are crazy. They have reason to be upset with you. If you want trouble man, you will have Why didn't you let me kill him? It would be at the wrong time and in the wrong place. Do not worry, this will happen too. Wait! Quiet! Relax. You and I listen, the city is ours this afternoon You drove a flock of stubborn Mavericks from here to Pekos. You swallowed dust for ninety days and enjoyed being back. Guys, you deserve to throw it out. I pay the first round. It's a good start, to get drunk. However, we need money. Let's move. Let's leave our bellies at the bar. We have to pay the boys, here in town. Mr Anders, we will do it at home. Matt, you sound like my wife. You always want me to go home. Make sense. Yeah!... The boys need to break out after such a trip. I have $ 20,000 here. My wife is not here yet. And until it comes, let's throw it out. hein!... If it 's hard to go down, let alone go up. That's why I pay you, Matt. I cheers! I cheers!... Let the party begin! How about playing some music? Whatever you say, Mr. Anders. No thanks. I never drink. Oh, yes, I forgot. Don't you think that a man should drink some whiskey, where and when? Thank you for finding a job for the little one. Do not mention it at all. I knew Drag wanted help. Who are they? Those coyotes are local bounty hunters. For my part I can do nothing about their dirty work, as long as they do not break the law. Hope he's behave tonight, they do not Hey girls why not go dancing? Sitting with me is not right. Hey, you, bring the deck. Anders moves the largest herd in the area. Everything he took out of the crows with so much effort... will lose it on paper. Checkmate, I will pay them now, whatever you tell me. Why don't you wait see you tomorrow, boss? No, I will pay them now. They need them. Hey boys, listen guys, it's time to pay. I pray we arrive on time, because he will lose everything. Dad knows what he's doing. Since when; Once, as a newlywed, he bet all my clothes. And just so you know, he lost them. Then, like a fool, he tried to get them back. When he came home, I was chasing him with a fork. Hyah, hyah!... Now whatever I hear about your father will not surprise me. Matt will not leave him. Oh, yes, for sure. But he is always, on the wrong side. One is enough, but when two cheaters are together... become spoiled children. Hyah!... Do not dare to tell him what I said. Three ladies. Three aces. How did you do that, Ranger? I would not worry so much. All I want to win is a good horse. Ever since we started, I have lost $ 10. Your luck is not normal. I will make a bass turn and win. Now I will show you. And professionals have a way of losing. Have you ever won? Not even once. The boys came. Boys... Hello. The whole family came. Let's go my dear. What are you in a hurry? We just started. Even better, to leave immediately with all the money you have left. Come. I can not, I will play with the Captain ranger. Hey, I'm not a Captain. No. With a little luck we will leave soon. Oh, Eliza! What is. Didn't you see a man in a chair? Good night, boys. I hope you forgive us for ruining your game. But when my father starts playing, he forgets everything else. All right miss, it's time to retire. My God, no. There is no reason not to continue such a friendly game. I do not see how... No, Will you come with us. Checkmate. That's it! You will get your chairs back tomorrow morning. Come on!... Hey, my horse. Sam, you will give me a chance to lose a little more. My little girl is fine, eh? She got it from her mother. It definitely looks like a lot to her. What will happen to Ranger, will you bet or watch? Mr Garrett, I want to apologize for the way we treated you. You are welcome here. Thanks. Here you go. Oh, I will definitely like it! You do not need to bother me. Now no, thanks. Bring the glass of whiskey, I want to drink. Prochora, Sam. I will not stay any longer, Mr. Garrett, it is too late. Good night. Night. Good night. Good night. So, Sam, are you ready? I see them. Three kings. I will begin to believe that you are a professional gambler. Your luck will change, my friend. No, thank you, I do not drink. Is it a crocodile? Yes. He belonged to a guy who was lynched in Tombstone. Do you know why he was lynched? Because he always won. Good night, father. Goodnight My Love. Good night. Good night. I share, eh? My wife left the window open. Sorry, Sam, I'm coming in a minute. Jeffrey! Jeffrey! He killed him. The ranger killed him! Look over there! Stop the ranger! Stop, stop!... All ok. Yeah. I think Mr. Calhoun will have the end. We got rid of him, didn't we? Cut it out! What is funny. Wait, Fred. I want my share now. What do you guys say? No! What do you mean no? Go on, Baxter, pull and I will kill you. You have lost your mind, you will never run away with so much attention around you. They will lynch you, if they find out what you did Where do you have your mind? Take him out. Take it out here. What happened? I'm sorry, Sam. You are in custody. For what reason. You do not have the power to arrest me. Oh no! I have, when it comes to murder. This is crazy! You can not accuse me of murder. Eliza Anders accuses you... for the murder of her husband and robbery. Yeah, take the gun. The man is bluffing. He does not drink whiskey, but he was a mosquito. Sheriff, you know me very well. I'll kill you. I'm not a murderer. A lot can happen when you are drunk. You know I don't drink. I probably formed a wrong opinion. Anyway, everything will be seen in the trial. We will not go far, come on. Open the way. Go over. He will be tried. Sam... Do not be judged, let's hang him immediately! We will do justice, Sheriff. Do not try to stop us. I will not allow things to get worse than they are. I warn you, madam. And I tell you we will take him with us. Matt, put the rope aside. I will wrap it around his neck. You will not do it. I do not want to use it, but I will do it if you force me. Now, do it all back. We will lynch him. Hold on, Matt. Do not become impulsive. I suggest you send Matt to bring the judge. I will keep him here. I am not going to lose him. Now open the way for us to pass. Very well, we will all go back, but I want the trial to take place today Matt, go get the judge. Well, very good! C'mon c'mon. Silence order, order in the audience. Sit down and take the shit out. Mrs. Anders, Are you sure it's Sam Garrett so? Absolutely, you are very honest. But I was not alone, and my daughter saw him. And also those around the ranch. Enough. Mrs Anders, are you absolutely sure? Silence in the audience. Tell me, how did you recognize him? Excuse me... but I really do not understand, the question. me desculpe Surely if you know someone, you are honest, then you recognize him because you know him. Honestly, ask the witness... what did i do when he saw me. Well? After the shootings I ran down... and I found Jeffrey... dead! Then I saw this killer climbing the window... and go out into the yard. I knew it was Garrett. Enough. Thank you, Mrs Anders. And now your testimony, Sheriff. Come closer. I'm listening to you. Honestly, Mr. Anders was shot five times with a 44-gauge pistol. When we picked up Garrett this morning, we found... five bullets are missing from his weapon. Which is 44 caliber Colt. When we arrested him, the accused was still drunk. If I was drunk until morning, how did I manage to climb the window? He killed my dear Jeffrey, stole the money and then got drunk. This is funny, ma'am. The Sheriff thinks that because of the drink I did what I did. Silence in the audience, on court! Rita Anders. I would like to know if you recognized him. I would be lying if I said I was sure. Rita, you were with me! Yes, I saw someone. I was with my mother. But I still say that there is a possibility that it was someone else. It was him, all right. End of story! Your hesitation is admirable, Miss Anders. But I say that you may have been very upset, to think clearly. Yes I was, but... Then, explain to me your indecision. One thing, you are very honest. I mean, when I offered Mr. Garrett a drink at home, he refused. Surely that means something. You are a fool, Rita. I just told the truth. And I tell you that the truth is that the murderer should not go unpunished. Jurors are called upon to decide. Honestly, it is not necessary. We all agree that the accused is guilty of murder. Sam Garrett, the court finds you guilty of the murder of Jeffrey Anders... and sentences you to death by hanging. The execution will take place tomorrow at nine o'clock in the morning. Gentlemen... Can I have a cigar? Where are the matches? You're pushing your luck, Garrett. And how do I light it? I do not make the regulations. The Constitution states that you can have a cigarette. But it says nothing about fire. Garrett! Can you hear me, Garrett? I am talking to you. Get up. Come and cover me. Give me that paper. What paper? Do not try anything. Did you hear. I am going. Cover me. Very funny, Mr! I'm not so stupid as to have the gun with me. Tell them to leave the rifles, otherwise I preached you. Ate, do what he said. And now your belts. Throw it away, sir. And the gun! Collid!... Ah!... Push the belts here. All right and now enter the cell. Move. Are you done? Get in. Sheriff, I am not a murderer. Let me go. If I reach my headquarters, I think... I can explain the entanglement. I'm afraid I can not, Sam. I'm sorry... if they do not find you here in the morning, they will lynch me. Now give me the gun. Where is the rifle? Which rifle, Sam? Who shot? I do not know. You are free, I am leaving! It will be more useful to us free. Obviously he did not try to kill you. He shot you to drop your gun. Do you know who he was? Hein!... I suspect it was young Bob. It is possible. He likes Sam, but you have no proof. Nellu... I want you to keep the bandage for a few days. This is not a serious matter, do not worry. It is not my hand that worries me. It's my throat! It was obviously wrong for me to trust you. I should have known that the law unites you. And the wound, Mrs. Anders? It looks good. I hope you do not accuse me of helping Garrett. Sheriff, I warn you now. If I know you helped Garrett to break it I will not rest until you lose your star. You better wait until you have data, Mrs Anders. I order you and your men to stay out of it. Did you hear. And I order you to leave sir understand. Is this your justice, Sheriff? I want this man found. I will proclaim him. Will you proclaim him? Yes, with $ 1,000. They are crumbs. It's worth more. Why? The guy is very smart. And I bet he's fast with the gun. It is not easy to catch. And how much do you want, stranger? How many? A thousand dollars each. Very well, I agree. But whatever happens to Garrett, the agreement does not apply. I want to see him hanged. If I were you, I would look for him in the Indian reservation. In the hills of Pony. There is grass and plenty of water. Thank you, Sheriff. At least now justice will be done. The Sheriff is right. The camp is a good hiding place. For illegals for sure, but not for rangers. There is only one thing we can do. Let's go to his headquarters in Tucson. Take a look at this dress, Nancy. I have to pick the vegetables and then start sewing again. Your father can get some when he goes to town. Someone is coming. Call your father. Find out who he is! Hello, Sam. Hello. I am glad to see you. Did you find Rex? Yeah, it was just... too late. Leave the horse in the cistern and come to rest for a while. Would you mind putting it in the barn with the others? Why not. Come, I will come with you. John, I have to tell you I broke it. What happened. I have just been convicted of murder. Will you believe me if I tell you that I am not guilty? Of course, Sam, I will. John!... You were not surprised! Exactly, Sam. I already knew that. All I wanted was to hear you say it. You have been proclaimed. The Sheriff's boys passed a while ago. They informed all the ranchers to keep their eyes open. Need help. If I could find out I got involved, I could defend myself. At the trial I did not know what to say. Someone killed Jeffrey and made me guilty. But why did it help me escape? This is what I do not understand. John, if I could get to my headquarters in Tucson, maybe i can clear my name. Quick, hide behind. I will try to stop them from entering the house. Clear the table. Help me, Nancy. Do you know who they are? No. Do you know Ranger, Sam Garrett? Yes I know him. And I know why she is looking for him, but ... I'm afraid I have not seen Sam. If I see him, I will say it. The money will be useful to me as well. How about some bread, sir? Of course, if you wait a while I will bring you right away. Better to go in and get it. As you wish. Mary, our friends are hungry. Yeah, and we are thirsty. Hello boys, sit down. I'm sorry, but all we have is some bread and cheese. Ane Nancy, bring dishes. Life here is like a cemetery. It reminds me of a girl I once had. It had an identical ranch, but twice as large. I am telling the truth. He looked good, Sam. What, Red? The girl, you idiot. Do you know what I guess? That she is still waiting for me. So that she does not die alone. You were wrong. I would marry her, sell the ranch and return to the city. Come on, my daughter, do not take us all day, they are ready. I do not like that he looks like that, he suspected something. You have to get away, go from behind. They will not see you, when enter the stable. John... give me a gun. I only have this. Now go from behind. I will try to distract them. That's what you have to do. Thanks. They will be busy eating for a while. Good luck, Sam. How do you like the cheese? It tastes good, huh? You can not buy such cheese around here. All right, let's go find him. Lors. Go from behind. I was running. Throw it away, sir. Do you want to have the end of Baxter? Wherever it hides, it will definitely have coverage. Get his horse. And now what. Without his horse he will not be able to reach his seat. He may try, but it is thirty miles. There is nothing out there but rocks. The nearest place is Poppin Creek. What if he takes the train before we catch him? Can move. Do not become a fool. If you start drinking your hands will tremble. I guess you think he's so blind he won't see us here. It does not matter if he does. You lost them! Chill out. Try to use your mind, kid. You don't use your own horse. And if he finds out where they are selling horses? Maybe go buy one. Do not worry. All he can buy is a train ticket. Then we go to catch him at the station. No. We will get on the train. The guy will not run straight to the station. Hello. Hello. When is the next train to Tucson? About an hour. Did you hear. He will be here in an hour. Oh, Sam! I have a whole hour. How about I serve you a drink? Why not. Daisy, keep him busy. I will go to your room. I would like it, are! You are lucky nice. You can treat me to whiskey, all right. In a minute. I have something to do. Of course. Do not be too late. Forget it, Troy. Well, the puppy follows his guardian. Hey, what happened? I did not want these two to see me. It's all right. They didn't notice anything. You can rest in peace What time does the train to Tucson arrive? In about an hour. Ah, ah!... What did those two below want? Sam with you. The train to Tucson. Yeah!... Can you do me a favor? I want a good horse. It will not be so difficult, but first you need a towel, what do you say? Hey, Daisy, what about the towel? Bring his horse. We will camp here. Horses need water and rest. Unless, of course, You're in a hurry to get back to town, Garrett. Do not lose sight of him. How will I eat with my hands tied? You ask for a lot. It is not for you. When your body goes back and forth, it will not need food. You will pay for it. You killed him, didn't you? You hoped I could do it. But when you saw what the end of the battle would be, you had to kill him. All you are interested in is the fee for the notice. And now you do not have anyone to share it with. You are hard enough behind a rifle. Let's see if you have real guts. Come on, drop your weapons. I could just clean you up. But you are wrong if you think you can beat me. I'm waiting for you. Sam! I was right! What did I tell you? We would let the law handle it, if there was justice. Do not waste any more time, boys. Do not worry, Mrs. Anders. You will get the justice you want after a few formalities. Do you want an official report, Sheriff? I hope you have realized ... that his arrest cost me three men. Everything will be recorded, Mr. Alan. Prepare the carriage, I want it to end. Hey, come with me. There is no one left to share the cash. Well!... Exactly, Vince. Only you and me. You will get what you deserve. I want to talk to you, Sheriff. No sense in telling you now I don't wanna ruin the suprise. You will just spend your saliva. There is nothing you can say to hold the crowd back now. To be honest, I was hoping you had escaped. Did you interrogate the boy? Bob? Of course I did. He claims he did not shoot. He's telling the truth. Sheriff, I know who he was. I know! What are we delaying? We are ready, ma'am. You, wait here. Well, Sheriff, we are waiting for you. I'm sorry, Sam. You were tried and found guilty. My job is to execute the sentence. Listen, Garrett. In this last hour of yours, may you find peace, if you accept your guilt. I'm innocent. Mother! No! My thoughts are with your father. May God show mercy to your soul. These were in the saddle cases. Your husband's money. I do not think you will find them missing. Are you convinced now? I suppose yes. Hands up. You were right, Sam. It was him. Your accomplice Baxter stole the cash from you... and Sam took them from Baxter when he shot him. It was the only way to catch him on the spot. Murder! He's the killer. So you, were the one who killed my Jeffrey! Murderer! Throw your gun. Quick, your weapon. Vince, we have to leave. They discovered everything. So!... The ranger is alive. I do not know how, but the Sheriff knows everything. It is not my problem. I no. And what about your percentage, man? They know. Not right now. And what do you want. You know, but I'll tell you. The money of the announcement. Alan, I would gladly give them to you. I mean it. All cash... are locked in there. Then he opened it. I can not say. Open it you. Ah, ah!... I do not know where the keys are, Alan. Believe me! Open it. Alan! Throw your gun and go out with your hands up. And Alan, walk slowly. It is not enough to apologize to you, Mr Garrett. Your horse, Sam. Appreciate I will keep it as a souvenir. Put it on. Put it on, Sam. All right, Bob. It must have been difficult and painful. It was a trick where I pretended... a frantic and dirty hanging. Ah!... Ah, ah!... Hanging on to it is very simple. And!... Better not, he may not catch a second time. He got what he deserved. He was the one who killed Mr. Anders. Yeah! Goodbye. Hello, Sam. "THE END"
