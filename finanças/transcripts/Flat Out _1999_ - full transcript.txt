[Soft nostalgic music plays.] [Faster modern music plays.] [Sounds from the speedway.] Hey. Hey. Did you warm up? Yes. Did you eat your power bar? Yes. Did you... Was it like this before we got married? No. You weren't as obedient. Obedient? Ouch. Shut up... Hey hey hey... No sex before a fight. He's racing not fighting. Are you forgetting how Vogel rides? Sean, I got a huge favor to ask of you. What do you need now Jason? I really need to borrow your spear motor. You're dreamin' Rolap. There is absolutely no way. I don't know Jas... that's the only spare we got. What happened to yours? I don't have anything spare. I don't have brake levers, clutch levers, anything. I don't know... Well... Sean... that is a five-thousand-dollar motor. You can't do this. You'll bring it back right after the finish right? Yeah. Right after the race. You're crazy. Sam's gonna kill both of us. I'm not gonna burn for this. [Race track sounds] Uhh... alright. Thanks. I'll see you right after the race. Why? Why did you do that? It's karma. Karma? Karma. Next thing you know, you'll be donating your kidney or something. [Fast paced music plays.] [Motorcycle engines rev and scream.] [fast driving music plays.] [Race anouncer over the PA: OK so this race is on the books and uhh... Wow.] What a race between Vogel and Powel. The two riders riding very aggressively bumping and grinding... It looked like they might even hooked their handle bars... Wow I don't know. They could have very well bumped. We'll let the team mates Vogel and Powel work that out. in the team trailer. [A melancholic music cue plays.] Hey... wait up a second. Don't you hear me talking to you? What in the hell's your problem? Your riding all over the place out there. Hey man... It's not my fault you can't stay on the track. Hey... you wanna take up something safe? Try bowling. [Distant city sounds.] [Birds singing in the trees.] Oh... oh look. There's the neighbor. He's so weird. I just think he's quiet. Come on let's go. [Funky groove music plays.] How come Marty gets away with riding like that? I don't know. Well, at least you won't be racing aginst him next year. He won't go to Europe if he signs a better deal here. What are you doing? I like the view better from back here. Is this what you call incentive training? That's a good name for it. Ahh... Are you tired? No are you? A little bit. Race ya home. OK. [Funky music continues.] [The music fades out.] [Slow sensuous music plays.] [Distant city sounds.] Hey bro. Don't do that man. You scare the hell outta me. What's up? I'm sorry. I just came by to see how things are going. Things are cool. Are you getting pumped up for Daytona? yeah. Sean. I wanna see you in my office. Yeah... I'll be there in a sec. Did Jason get the motor back? Yeah. Right after the race. Just like he promised. I guess it can't be about that then. I'll be right back. [Knock knock knock.] Come in. Have a seat. What's up? I wanna talk to you about what happened at the track today. Yeah I do too. What's the deal with letting Marty ride like that? What? Marty rides like Marty. That's not what I wanted to talk about. I'm referring to you lending out my spare parts. Ah ah ah. I'm not finished. You know... I'm curious. Were you going to pay the seven thousand dollars if your extra special friend blew up my motor? Listen, I'm sorry about the motor. I realize it wasn't in the best interest of the team... But we've talked about how road racing needs a big boost. We both wish it was as big as NASCAR. I figured the only way we're ever going to get anywhere is to help each other out any way we can. Come on save it. No seriously. I lent it so this rider would get more points and hopefully get sponsored. More sponsorship means more coverage... And more coverage ultimately means more spectators. I understand where you're coming from... But I don't want this ever to happen again. At least not without clearing it with me first. I promise. It will never happen again. What about Marty? Well... what about him? Come on... He almost ran me off the track. Look Shawn, you're a kick-ass rider. I mean... you got plenty of things lined up for next year no matter how you finish. You were talking about raising interest right? Well Marty's tactics... No matter how unethical they are... raises interest. Raises PR. I mean... It's controversial. Besides.... Now I get two riders on the podium. You're not going to get two riders on the podium if he takes both of us out. Sean, you know it does not get any easier. Let me get this straight. It's okay with you if he takes both of us out? That's not what I meant. [Crickets and mysterious music plays.] [Soft ethereal music continues.] [Alarm clock goes off.] What time is it? it's five o'clock. Go back to sleep. I'm gonna go out and get some laps early. I'll have Ron pick you up on his way out ok? OK. [Distant city sounds.] [Ominous music plays.] I guess it's time to roll a fatty. That's my boy. Always comin' prepared to fly us off to some new horizon. Ha ha ha. [The ominous music continues.] [Skid and crash sounds.] [Crashing crumpling metal sounds.] [Birds chirpping.] [Spooky music plays.] [Distant sirens approach.] [Police radio: Unit six Los Angeles show me out at mile post 1 27 9 just north of the damn. I gotta vehicle over the side about 800 900 feet over... You're gonna have to contact sheriff's search and rescue. Get them up here as soon as possible. I can't get down there at all. Search and rescue 3 on scene. Medic three to command. We have a single patient mid-thirties male. Unconscious. We need full C spine precaution. Large bore IV and check the status of the trauma center. LA unit 6 go ahead and roll another unit up here for back up I got a couple unmanageables in a white van. Most likely under the influence of a narcotic or an opiate. Trauma center's been notic=fied and standing by for your code yellow. [ER doctors chatter.] [ER beeps and sounds.] [Beeps and Doctors continue with ominous music.] [the beeps slow and get deeper.] [Hospital ambiance.] Have a seat please. Oh there you are? I'm Sean's father. OK have a seat. Thanks. Well as you guys know, Sean was brought in... with a fractured vertebra in the thoracic region of his back. And that means what? It means that Sean is paralyzed. And I hate to be the one to tell you guys this but he will never be able to walk again. Can we see him? Well, he's very sedated right now. It might be better if you guys wait till tomorrow. Please... can we just look in on him? OK. Alright. But only for a minute OK? [City distant traffic.] Oh great you're awake. My name is Dr. Augsta. How come all the nurses keep dodging my questions? Well... I'm afraid they're not allowed to tell you anything. That's hospital policy. ok so you tell me. OK. Sean... You suffered a umm... complete lesion to your third thoracic vertebra. I can't feel my legs. Your spinal cord suffered a tremendous shock. Are you telling me that I'm not going to walk again? I'm afraid so. You mean to tell me there's no operation or anything that'll give me a second chance? I'm sorry. If there was a chance I'd tell you. Your spinal cord has been pinched so bad that it's cut off the signal from the brain. So unpinch it. Well, we'll try to relieve the pressure... But there's a risk involved in that. I mean it could raise your paralysis. You see, nerves are... They don't regenerate like skin. I'm afraid you know.... you... you've done so much damage that there's no way of reversing the process Look... If you need me... Why don't you have one of the nurses page me. OK? Sorry Sean. [Doctors being page over the PA] [Crickets and distant traffic.] [Distnat traffic.] [Hospital ambience... beeps, Dr.'s being paged.] Do you want something to eat? No. Sean... Someone here to see you. Hey man I brought you some cookies. I been meaning to come in and see how you're doing. How am I doing? Isn't that pretty damn obvious? Sean... I'm really sorry about... I don't need your pity. What? Am I supposed to pretend like we're old friends? You don't need to act like that. What I don't need is him coming in here expecting me to make him feel better. Get the hell outta here. Fine. You don't know if that's why he came in here. You know something... you'll never understand. Sean... Don't take your hostility towards him out on Lisa. She doesn't deserve it. I'm the one that doesn't deserve it. This is something you're going to have to deal with. You don't have to do it alone. We're both here for you man. Man... I'm gonna go see where Lisa went. I've got some things I need to do OK? See ya tomorrow. [Hospital ambience and beeping] [Crickets and distant traffic.] Hey. You OK? Uh hun. He doesn't know how bad it hurts when he talks to me that way. He's going through a really tough time. No. I think he's right. That we won't be able to understand. Come on. Things will be fine. [Sobbing] I have no idea... how it's going to be like for us Ron. Things will work them self out OK? Don't worry. It'll be just fine. Man... Welcome to paradise. Gee thanks. Who was that? My team mate. What team? Road racing. Oh. For a minute there, I thought you were talking about football. Why? Is that what happened to you? Yeah. Last three minutes of the game. Last game of the season. Man that sucks. Ha. Tell me about it. And I had over 20 scholarship offers. Wow. So what did your team bring you? Chocolate candies. Can I have some? Sure. Here. Oh... man... What? I can't grab 'em. I'm a quad. Oh dude I'm sorry. Ahh... don't be sorry. Just call for the nurse. Alright. [Phone rings] Yeah... shop. Accident... what? You sure about that? Man... that's too bad. Yeah, he's one of my best riders. Yeah... yeah... alright thanks. That's too bad. [Slow deep music plays] It's time for PT. What in the hell is PT? Physical therapy. Looks like pretty tasty to me. You're too kind Vincent. Good. Go bug him. Do you wanna get outta here? Could you guys pipe down over there. I'm trying to take a nap. You pipe down. Smooch off. Look... You need to learn what you need to know in order to make it out there, OK? Like what? Like... How to get in and out of a car or shower. Now here take this. What's this? It's a dumb bell. You need to curl it. Why am I having so much trouble? Well, you've been through a very traumatic experience and your muscles have atrophied but... they're going to come back fast. Trust me. Come on. ... 9... Well I need 20 on each arm. 4 times alright? Four times? Yep. I must work my arm. This is embarrassing. Well you're doing great. [Upbeat motivational music plays.] You awake? Yeah. What are you thinking about? I don't know. I just can't sleep. I know what I'm thinking about. What? Going home... and sleeping in my own bed. Yeah. How do you do it? I haven't seen you down yet. Well... I don't think about what I can't do... I think about what I can. That keeps me going. Go to sleep man. Night bro. [City traffic sounds.] I'm outta here you guys. Just came by to say goodbye. Alright man... take care of yourself my brother. I will I will. Will you come and visit? Only if it's on a stretcher. Oh come on. I wasn't that bad. I think he's scared of me. No doubt. The man's dangerous in his wheelchair. Oh listen to you. No but seriously... I just want to say thanks. Hey man... you would have done it for me. I was talking about Brenda. Ohhh.... listen to you. Keep up with the range of motion over the next few years. I will I will. It's very important. And as for you Hey man you got the number... call me bro. OK. Peace. Alright. Bye. [Birds tweeting distant neighborhood dogs bark] I hope this ramp is gonna be alright for ya? Lisa and I uh... we made it. It took us 3 bags of cement... To make this thing. Looks pretty good huh? Where's Zoe? She was staying with your mother and I... She couldn't wait to get back home so... we... we brought her back yesterday. Zoe. Sean... are you OK? I don't know what I'm gonna do. Well... you just gotta take it one-day at a time. I'm just scared Dad... you know? Yeah... I can imagine. Yeah. You know uhh... Your mother and I... we're just a phone call away right? Yeah. [Sniffle.] [Dog barks in the distance.] Your mother... she uhh... she thinks I ought a put another railing up over here. I think it's a good idea. [Slow heavy ominous music plays.] [Music fades out.] [Supermarket ambience. Cash registers in the distance.] How'd you get in a wheelchair? I was in an accident. Did you bleed? Yeah. Did it hurt? Uhh... No. You bled and it didn't hurt? Nope. Can you move your legs? No. Can you try? There. Come on try. You didn't try. Try. Oh Bud, enough with these lame questions... Can't you see the man has enough problems of his own? Talk talk talk talk come on. When are we gonna get the batteries? Forget the batteries. Sorry sir. Sorry. [Birds tweeting.] [Slow blues plays.] [Music slowly builds.] Don't worry. I'll get them. Hey. How about some lunch? I'm not hungry. Excuse me. Can you get outta the way? You don't have to be rude. [The ominous tone music plays again.] [Russian singing and guitar playing.] [Phone rings.] Hello? Hi honey. How are you? Uhh... Hi Mom. Darling... what's wrong? [Speaking Russian.] Nothing. I'm Your Mother. Don't you think I can tell when something wrong? Mom... What did you call for? [Speaking Russian.] Can't you talk to me any more? [Speaking Russian.] How can you expect me to talk to you when all you do is... telling me... that I made... wrong decision marrying Sean? You can't... blame me for being right. Can you? [Speaking Russian.] Please... give it a break Mom. Just remember... that... our door... is always open and... You can come home anytime. [Speaking Russian.] Did you call just to do this to me? No sweetie... [Speaking Russian.] We love you and... Daddy and I... just... Just want to see you happy. Mom... Well then stop callin me and telling me that I made the wrong choices in my life. [Crying and speaking Russian.] Good bye Mother. [Sounds of motorcycle race coverage on TV.] I'm sick and tired of the way you've been acting. You've got to stop this nonsense Sean. I don't want to be married with someone who just going to sit around the house getting drunk. Don't you have anything to say? I'm standing here telling you that I'm going to leave if you don't make a change. And you just sit here? and don't have anything to say? What in the hell's wrong with you? I don't even know who you are anymore. Why are you doing this? Don't you care anymore? Don't you hear what I'm saying? What do you want me to say? Yes I hear what your saying. I can't take it. I'm going to stay with my Mom. [Slow piano plays.] [Music fades out.] [Birds tweet.] [Slow but upbeat music plays.] [Phone rings.] Hello? Lisa? Hey... I just wanted to tell you that I'm really sorry. I don't know what to say... I know that it's been really hard to be around me while I've been trying deal with this whole thing. I've been so worried about you. I know... I'm just trying to figure things out. I don't know what to do with my life. It's so hard Leese. You don't think I realize that? I do. I'm not gonna let this ruin us. Are you going to quit doing this to yourself? I'm gonna quit doing this to both of us. I promise I'm gonna get myself back together. Won't you please come back? I can't take it. I'm serious... I love you but when you're like that... you're someone I don't know. And that is something... I'm not going to subject myself to any more. No more. I promise. Good. I just don't want to lose you. You know? I don't to loose you either. I love you. I love you too. I'll be home later OK? Great. See you later? Yeah bye. [Upbeat hopeful music plays.] Hey bud. What's up? Nothing. I just came in to ask for a favor. Sure... What with? Well I've come up with an idea but I need your help building it. Building what? Landing gear. Landing gear? For what? A motorcycle. You know like for an airplane but for a motorcycle. Sean listen man. You gotta realize you're riding days are over. This is just not sane. You know you said you'd be there for me. You can't use that against me man. I am there for you. Riding again would be a suicide mission and you know it. You know I came in here to ask your help to regain something that was taken away from me. Not to help kill myself. Don't blame me if I don't wanna be part of this OK? I'm going to do this with you or with out you. Well... I wish you good luck. [Ominous music builds.] Can you help me with this? What is this? They're blueprints. What for? For landing gear. So I can ride again. What in the hell do you mean so you can ride again? It's simple. It'll just pivot back-and-forth. You know they'll hold me up when I stop. You have got to be kidding. No. I'm not kidding. I think I can ride again. Yeah you think you can ride again. I thought you were working on the stop drinking plan. I am. I haven't had a drink since I came up with this idea. So that's why you stopped? Has nothing to do with us. Now that's not true. If you don't agree to drop this ridiculous idea right now... you can kiss my ass goodbye permanently. You know what riding means to me. Why are you acting this way? Because I will not sit around watch you kill yourself trying to ride a motorcycle. Kill myself? I'm trying to get a piece of me back. It's not like getting a part of you back. It probably will take more away from you. Can't you see that? Lisa, I love you and I'd do anything for you. But this is for me. I have to do this Don't bother saying another word. I'm moving out tomorrow. [Birds chirping.] Lisa, what are you doing? What do you think I'm doing? Do you remember what we were talking about last night? Yeah, Of course I remember. You don't need to ask then. You don't have to do this you know. I could say the same to you. Listen, I'm done talking about it. It infuriates me that you won't respect my wishes. And quit this idiotic idea. It's not an idiotic idea. I'm trying to get something back that was taken away from me. And as I said before... I'm done talking about it. Good bye. Lisa come on. [Quick tempo hip music plays.] Yeah... I wouldn't worry about it too much. Same thing happened to me. Oh yeah? How's that? My girlfriend run off... From the driveway... in front of a bunch of people. Is she coming back? No. I'm sorry to hear that. Well don't be. I'm not. How long ago did she leave? Oh... going on 12 years now. That gives me hope. Well... Don't think that uhh... just because my never came back that's what's going to happen to you. Want a beer? Yeah why not? Meet me around the side. Alright. 3 beers? Uhh... 2 for me. Drink up. Thanks man. You don't mind if I uhh... ask you about uhh... your problems with that lady. No. I don't mind. I came up with an idea of how I can ride a motorcycle again. So she ran off and left you in your hour of need. Yeah, her and everybody else. I guess I've been sitting around the house a lot. So they think I'm on some kind of a... Suicide mission or something. Everybody thinks the same thing about me. Oh yeah? Man I've never seen your garage door open before. I didn't realize you had so many tools. Well once upon a time I used to be a serious mechanic but uhh... Some where along the line I got sidetracked. Really? Doing what? Drinking. Mostly. Oh. [Distant highway traffic sounds.] [Knock knock knock...] Hey. How ya doing? Oh pretty good. I came back to show you uhh... the plan that I have for the... the landing gear I was telling you about in the garage? Let's see what you got. Looks like a... Somebody ripped it up. Yeah, my wife tore it up. That's why she left this morning. You see they just... raise and lower right there and it'll hold the bike up when it stops. It looks uhh... Looks promising. Not a bad idea. I think it'll work. I don't suppose you'd be willing to help me build it? I mean you got lots of stuff in the garage, I'm sure you could build it pretty easily. Na... na shit. I don't think so. I'm not... you know I'm just uhh... I'm not doing that stuff anymore. I understand. I didn't mean to like impose or anything... I just wanted to show it to you. It's alright. Good luck with it. Alright man. Well thanks for the beer. Sure... sure. See ya. Alright. [Sensitive piano music plays.] Phone rings. Hello? Hey. Oh hey. What are you doing? Just helping my mom. I really miss you. I called to see when you're coming back Are you willing to drop this whole motorcycle thing? No. Well, there's your answer. Why can't you understand what this means to me? It's like getting a piece of me back that was taken away. Don't you see how insane this it? This stupid idea is something that could take away all that you have left. I thought you wanted to spend the rest of your life with me. I do... You obviously don't care about us anymore. That's not true Leese. Yes it is Sean. You're too damn stubborn to see that you are the only one holding all the cards. All you have to do is just drop this stupid idea... And I would come back. It's not that easy. [Click... dial tone.] Damn it. [Slow heavy bass beat plays.] [Music fades out.] [Inspirational music builds and picks up pace.] Man... have you been in here all night? Yeah... check this out. Just about to bolt it up. No way. Um hum... pretty clean huh? Yeah. What's it made out of? Stainless. Found a bunch of it laying around. Just right. I can't believe it man. What are you gonna do about the electronics? Well I gonna have probably one of those linear ball screw actuators. Like those satellite dish positioners... to raise and lower this and then I'll probably get like a solenoid or something to do the shifter. Well, why don't you spend the rest of the day thinking about that... And I'm gonna get some shut eye. OK. You want me to bring you lunch later or anything? Well as a matter of fact... I'm all out of beer. Beer. OK. I can do that. Okeedoke See you later. Peace brother. [Heavy base beat plays.] Hey how you guys doing? You been riding long? Me? Ha ha ha... no. Not me. Never. Well that's not a very good bike for beginners. Well the bike's for him... not me. ok [Distant highway traffic sounds.] Hello? You feel like going for a ride? No way. You're done already? Absolutely. I don't like to waste a lot of time. Well how's it work? Just like you planned. I got the left handlebar switch is for the landing gear up and down and the right's for the shifter. You're the man. I can't wait for you to see it. Come on over. Alright I'm on my way. Alright. Well you really did it. I can't believe it. Looks good yeah? It looks awesome. No way. Thank you so much. Need some help getting on? No I think I can do it. Let me see... If I throw my foot up first... Well, you got that wired. Yeah, it wasn't too bad huh? Well, fire it up. Man this feels weird. How do you mean? Balance wise? Yeah, like I'm in a barrel of Novocaine. I can't feel. You gonna be alright? Yeah I think so. OK cowboy. Take off. I'll be here if you need me. OK. [Servo motors wind.] [Fast paced music plays.] Oh... [crashing sounds.] Oh nuts. [Birds tweet.] Oh man... Ha ha ha holy shit... Oh man... You pinned? No the landing gear saved my leg. Ha ha ha... Is this driver error or Shoddy workman ship? I think it's research and development. Holy christ... What happened? I don't know. I think the landing gear bent. We gotta get you a helmet pal... Well now you know... what not to do right? Yeah... I think I fractured my elbow. Can you streighten out your arm? Not without extreme pain. Ha ha ha... Back to the drawing board. OK. [Phone rings.] Hello? Hey there madman. How's the arm? It's not too bad. They give you anything for it? Tylenol with codeine. Really? Demerol is my favorite. Listen, I think I figured out why you crashed. You did? All the struts on the landing gear... I think the metal was too weak. Too thin. I made up some other ones. It's a lot stronger now. Oh man thanks. Come on over and check it out. OK. [Phone rings.] Hello? Hi. I heard that you crashed. Are you all right? Yeah I'm all right. How did you find out about that? Oh Mrs. Parker called me. Who is Mrs. Parker? The neighbor. Oh... What's so funny? Nothing. Are you done with all this now? No. The only reason I crashed was... cause... [Click... dial tone.] Damn. [Deep base music plays.] [Knock knock knock...] Come in. Hi. Huh? Umm... I came to talk to you. About what? About Sean. What about him? You know what? Uhh... I want to ask you to stop helping Sean to do this insane motorcycle thing. Well listen. He came to me. Alright? He's already paralyzed and now it's so hard for him to be like he is and... So you want him to sit around and stare at the wall for the rest of his life. Is that what you want him to do? No it's not that. I'm just don't want I don't really think you give a damn. Please Gene... Get outta here. Gene... It's... Get outta my house. I'm gonna do what I'm gonna do. Don't bother me. Come on Lisa. Come on. Let's get outta here. God. It's insane. You're insane. You think I'm gonna just stand here and let you kill my son? I don't know what the hell you're gonna do. You know I almost lost him once... I'm not gonna lose him again. Yeah well don't be so sure. [Crickets.] [Birds chirp.] [edgy fast ominous music plays.] Pretty damn good. [fast edgy music continues.] Hey check out this bike coming your way. It's got some weird thing on the side. Yeah I saw that. Looks like some kind of strange wheel set up. [The fast music continues.] [Servo motor winds.] Pretty slick. Man that is the best therapy in the world. Well you sure we're moving. I heard you all the way down there and back. You must have been wide open. Practically. Hey, how's my time? 9:56. Man... Well... give yourself more credit than that. I wish I could drag my knee still. Why would you wanna do that? It helps with the cornering. You know, you could right the bike up when it start sliding. That'd scare the hell out of me. Man... I wish I could race. Yeah... I wish you could too. That sure would be a slight. Yeah. How the hell you gonna hide that landing gear? I've been thinking about that. If you like have a little discreet rod hold me up... All they have to do is start it. You can catch me at the end. You're crazy. You know that don't ya? No way. What track are you thinking about? I'd like to race Daytona again. Get out of here. Where is that anyway? It's in Florida. Wanna go? Might as well. Awesome. [Ominous music plays.] [Music changes to an upbeat pace.] [Fast hard competitive music plays.]] [Music fades out and the race announcer talks over the PA system.] OK welcome to beautiful Daytona Beach Florida. Really looking forward to the upcoming race. The racers out on their warm up lap right now. Several riders very very close in the points battle The pace car is out pacing this field and catching the last runers as they head out of the pre grid out onto the racing surface for their siding lap. Temperatures looking pretty good today... It's about 90 degrees... pretty humid. But Uhh... the riders all ready to go. Race ready . Tire pressures are set. The motorcycles are fueled and as I said they're taking their warm-up laps working their way around making their grid positions and will be up on the five-minute board very shortly. Really looking forward to the race today as these racers working way around.... I see Dennis Smith working his way up around on the warm-up lap as well as Tony Silvera. They keep getting back on maybe the third and fourth row Joe Davidson next to him as well as Larry Cochran. and Ken Waco so they're working the warm up lap right now. The attention is building right now we can see them heading out of the pits... around the track. They're going back and forth getting the tires warmed up, making sure that the tires are uhh... feeling like they should and the suspensions are finally dialed in the way they want. The riders hearts no doubt beating very heavily as they head around for this warm-up lap and are just about ready to take their grid positions. Of course the warm-up lap always important to get that engine up to temperature make certain that the tires are exactly warmed up because boy when that green flag drops and these riders head off into that first turn it is absolute chaos. You've got 40 riders going for the same three foot line and it's always very exciting. They'll be bumping and grinding and all sorts of action. The riders are heading around right now getting up onto the grid positions we can see uhh... we can see the umbrella ladies holding... oh the beautiful Budweiser umbrella ladies holding the umbrellas against the Florida Sun here as the riders are taking their grid positions. Of course some of the privateer teams here they they don't have as much support and those riders qualifying a little bit slower than some of the factory rides. Hey Jason... No way Sean... did you come to watch me race? not really [Track ambience: Bikes screaming by] What are you off your nut? No man, I'm serious. I'm calling in that favor you owe me. Yeah, I haven't forgotten Sean... but really. Jason, I gotta do this and you're my only way in. I don't know Shawn. Don't forget I was there for you. Yeah, you were. So you'll do it then? Well, if anything it'll be one hell of a story to tell. Yeah, it will. What do you need me to do? I need you to qualify, I'll take it from there. Alright. Starting on that third row Orlando Pablo uhh... he's doing very well in the points this year. He is about a hundred and eleven points into the championship by about 40 points behind the lead right now. Of course Brice Gross, another privateer rider... he taking his grid position right now... he's riding the suzuki GSXR and Brice doing very well running the National circuit this year. Chuck Raves, of course another local rider he traveled over from the west coast to be here at Daytona today and the privateer rider has raced all over the world. He's got a very good program put together for this year on the Yamaha and we're looking for Chuck to do well today. Moving back to that fifth row I show Jeremy Toy. Jeremy Toy another club racer who is entered the National Rex and a local rider here at Daytona hoping to do well today against these nationally-ranked riders. Honda mounted Danny Farnsworth also with the factory ride for the first year on that Honda superbike. Honda having a little bit of problems trying to get some of the technical stuff sorted out but a Farnsworth doing very well finishing I believe it was fourth at Road Atlanta and respectable 3rd. He got the podium at Laguna Seca. The Honda team again having a hard time this year course then again we've got Marty Cooksie on the Harley-Davidson. Harley-Davidson... making some progress this year and Harley with two podium finishes and of course Marty the rider moving over from the Kawasaki team on to Honda for this season. How's it look? It looks pretty good. Try not to move around too much. It's not very steady. Alright but stay as long as you can so you can block the view. OK. Thanks a lot man you know... I couldn't have done it without you. Ahh... don't go getting sappy on me now... Just buy me a beer and we'll call it even. You got it. Don't fall off. I won't. Thanks. We're just a couple minutes away from the green flag start. The riders again are getting on their grid position. We are upon the 5 minute board now. Just about ready to take the 2-minute board and in fact here it comes so the teams are now clearing the grid as the riders now making those last-minute adjustments I see I see Brian Long's tuner giving him some last-minute advice. Kevin President gridded up. He's on that second row but Kevin a guy to watch out here today. The hearts are beating and they're just about ready to take the green flag. In fact the starter now holding the flag. We're up on the one minute side board in there they go. The green flag drops... forty motorcycles ladies and gentlemen heading at the fastest raceway on the East coast. Daytona Beach Florida. [High energy music plays.] 40 motorcycles heading off to that first turn. Course these motorcycles accelerating from about 0 to 100 in about two seconds... 40 motorcycles going for that same three foot piece of pavement a couple of riders bumping as they get through the turn but they managed to keep it up and everyone's OK. Out to an early lead it appears that it's Aaron Lunsford and he is rocking off into turn number 2. He's staying in front of the pack as the rest of the riders managed to get themselves sorted up and down that short straight away. The riders out of the infield now onto the high banking and Boy these riders are pulling some very high G's along the high banking there as they accelerate down over the high banking of this tri oval Daytona Beach Florida. The riders accelerating up to over a hundred and eighty miles an hour pulling two or three G's. Their suspension compresses and ladies and gentlemen if you've ever been out there your helmet starts to press into your shoulder blades, your cheeks start to sag and at a hundred and eighty miles an hour, it gets very difficult to control these motorcycles as they head around that high banking. Of course they've got to haul down for that chicane on the back straightaway and in fact there they go. Hauling it down from a hundred and eighty miles an hour into the chicane and then accelerating back up to speed on to the high-banking as they head across the start/finish line. Ladies and gentlemen there is nothing like racing Daytona Beach Florida. On the Yamaha in the Lead he's followed by Tom Sara also the yamaha mounted rider and running in third right now, Robbie Ampoliski, whose been having a good dice with Tom Sarah. Of course the distant fourth and a rather lonely forth right now is Jason Rolap whose just been riding his own pace as the rest of the field about two terms behind that front pack. The privateer rider has been just astounding in this race is right now Rolap starting on the 10th grid position has already moved his way up to fourth which we're accustomed to seeing Jason Rolap do... the privateteer does very well but I have to make note of the fact that his riding style is so much different than I've been accustomed to seeing. He's riding like Mike Hailwood. He's barely hanging off the bike. The lean angles on this bike are tremendous in comparison to the hanging off style that Jason Rolap I'm used to seeing with Jason. I'm just pondering, perhaps Jason is injured somehow or another or perhaps is having a difficult time hanging off the motorcycle. And the riders have taken uh have taken the white flag and are moving across the start/finish line it is Larry Cochran, Tom Sara and Robbie Ampolski and of course Jason Rolap running a distant and lonely fourth right now. They head off in to that fast left-hander turn number one and down the short shoot and into turn number 2... Oh no... it looks like Robbie Ampolski under braking is trying to get underneath of Tom Sarah and ladies and gentlemen he's washed the front end and off into the dirt Robbie Ampolski is up is and OK but that puts Cochran solidly in the lead now as Sara had to break really hard to get uhh... to steer clear of the Ampolski crash and Jason Rolap now finds himself in 3rd. They're working their way through the rest of the infield and out onto the high banking and again I don't know if Tom Sarah has enough steam to get past Larry Cochran the first place rider. Tom Sarah also on the Yamaha right now, the two of them heading around the high banking down the long back straightaway through the chicane for the last time. Rolap as I said whose been riding as if he was stiff or perhaps injured in that third place now appears to be riding the pace to the checkered flag. This is the run for the checkers and in fact taking the checkered flag... Larry Cohcrine, Tom Sarah and here comes Jason Rolap rounding out your top third. So the racers just about in from their cool off lap. We're heading down to victory circle right now. We're gonna be conducting our winner's circle interviews and our top finishers coming in right now. First and second place bikes on their cool off lap. Waving to the crowd... the third-place finisher Jason Rolap... high tailing it into the pits and now he's heading into the winner's circle and boy, I'll tell ya, he's cooking into the winner's circle pretty fast. Well ladies and gentlemen, there's gotta be something seriously wrong here... Jason Rolap has just fallen over on his motorcycle that could have something to do with his riding. I suspect we need to get to med crew down here as Jason Rolap apparently having... is passed out or something but not even putting his feet down tipping over on the bike so a crowd gathering around Jason Rolap right now and we'll get some medical attention to him right away but he doesn't appear to be unconsciousness infact he's pulling his helmet off so I would have no idea why Jason Rolap would just come in and fall down. Perhaps a cramp or something like that but wait a minute here... I'm looking over... I'm trying to move through the crowd here as a crowd's gathered around this young gentleman here that while he's wearing Jason Rolap's leathers it sure doesn't look like Jason Rolap... It's a familiar face however... [Victoriuos music plays.] In fact that appears to be last year's contender in this class Sean Powel who suffered a debilitating automobile accident late last year. [Victorious music continues.] [Music fades out.] [[Ambient race tract sounds.] Welcome back to bike week magazine. 1984 Stewart Goddard crashed his street bike lost the use of his lower body went for 12 years without riding a motorcycle but still loved it never lost that passion then what happened? Now I'm racing again. Moto Liberty stepped forward and gave me a 125 ride and I have been racing since February. Won my first race and took second last weekend so I'm doing pretty good. It started with a street bike didn't it? Yeah, I started on a cbr900rr and I just moved on from there. The motorcycle that you are racing... it's a 125 CC and I kid you not... The guy is fast. You operation entirely with your hands. That's true. I have a shifter switch on the left grip that operates an electromagnetic solenoid that allows me shift up and down. That takes care of that problem. What about the breaking? The breaking on the street bike or the race bike rather is basically all in the front. A lot of the guys rely on just the front brake. Some of the guys use the back break but on a 125 it's so light... a lot of guys don't even use the breaks at all. They just use... rely on the downshifting. And while all of this is going on the obvious question has to be what do you do with your feet? The answer to that is Velcro. I need to get like a... sponsorship from Velcro because I buy so much of it I got it... I got it on my knees and on my foot pegs and on the soles of my boots. And that holds everything together. Then the large appendage on the tank is? It's because I am paralyzed at such a high level I don't have my ab muscles. So uhh... the pad up here allows me to free up my arm so I can ride. Oh man... that was fun. That was sweet dude. Right at the line. At the start they threw the flag before we ... You are a brave individual. I just do what I love doing Larry. And an inspiration I might add. I hope so. Folks, I gotta tell ya. This is no joke. It is no nothing other than a guy doing what he wants to do what he loves to do and he does go fast. He won his first race here a while back, has had several runner-up finishes and we want to wish you the best of luck out here this weekend. Thank you so much. [Inspirational piano music plays.] Why you doing this? Don't you hear what I'm saying? Sorry... sorry cut. That's insane. thing you're going to stand You're insane. You think I'm just gonna stand here and let you kill my son? I don't know what the hell you're going to do. You know I almost lost him once I'm not gonna lose him again. Yeah... well... don't be so sure. Bring me back some beer. Are you done with all this now? [Phone rings.] Cut... Ha ha ha... Some where along the line I got side tracked. Really? Doing what? Drinking... mostly. I'm gonna go in the house and shoot myself. Cut. Oh yeah? Doing what? Drinkin' mostly. Yep. Watchin' pornos... Cut. It's not like getting a part of you back... It's probably will take more away from you. Can't you see that? Lisa, I love you and I'd do anything for you... but this is for me. Ha ha ha ha... Is it that funny? Or are you crying? I have to do this. Why can't you see that? Lisa... I love you. I'd do anything for you... [Fire alarm beeps. Laughter.] Fire alarm. Fry's are done. Ha ha ha ha Let the dog come in. He can come in. So Gene's got a dog. Come here. Hey madman. Time out. Hello. Hey there Madman. How's the arm? Go back to sleep. I'm gonna go out early. I'll have Ron pick you up on the way out. Alright cut. Excellent. ????? It hurts. Yeah I bet it does. They give you anything for the pain? Tylenol with codeine. humm... Well when you get the Demerol let me know. I'd like to borrow a few. Bye. Cut.

And watch the phone... and... action. Hello? And action... You awake? Yeah. What are you thinking about? I don't know. Just can't sleep Why? I don't know. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha... OK start over. Well I had to pistol whip some trailer trash down in Yuka Vally just to get a hold of some of the loco lightning man. [Sounds of bikes racing at the track.] Hello? [Deep male voice "Hi honey how are you?"] [Laughing...] Ha ha ha ha ha ha You want a beer? Cut.
