Look at that. - [Driver] It looks mean. - We should stop. That poor soul is suffering in this steam bath. Why it's our Christian duty, that's what it is. - Well then I'm in league with the devil, because I'm not about to stop for some filthy hitchhiker. Eula, get your foot off the break. - [Eula] Don't worry. It's alright. Like a lift to town? - Yes ma'am. Why walk when I can ride? Say you all live in-- - Frenchman's Bend. The most nowhere place in the entire sweltering state of Mississippi. Honey, you can't but sneeze before they're saying you got pneumonia. Sometimes I feel like I'm wearing a straitjacket. As for social amusements, there are none unless you consider church a social amusement. Now, I do believe in Jesus. I truly do, but do you think he meant for life to be so dull? - Sounds fine to me. I'm quite living myself. - I only know one reason for living quiet. That's if you're too old to live any other way. And you look young, and healthy. - Uh huh. So you're saying you take your fun where you can find it. - Don't jump to any conclusions, mister. We're giving you a ride, and that's all we're giving you. - Where you headed? - I go as far as you go. - You sound as free as a bird. My how I admire that. Doesn't he sound as free as a bird, Noel? - Ms. Noel's wondering what kind of bird, aren't you, Ms. Noel? - You must be a mind reader. Noel's a school teacher. She wears out brain cells worrying about her spotless, I repeat spotless reputation. Why, she didn't want to pick you up. I said why not. It's such a nasty hot day, and there's two of us and one of him. And she said I think he looks mean and dirty. - I'd say the lady's a real judge of character. - [Man] Eula. - Isaac. - [Isaac] Eula. - Isaac. - [Noel] This is it, mister. - I have something for you. - Thank you, Ms. Eula. - It looks like Varner's a man to see around here. - You can find him over at our house most any time. - You all belong to Varner? - We two ladies most particularly belong to Varner. - Hi. - Howdy. Howdy boys. - How do? - How's a man make a living around here? - He don't. - Honest or dishonest? - Well, let me hear what's open. - Well sir, a man that's hard working and clean living can plant cotton over in the bottom lands, raise corn up along the edge of the hills. - If one isn't too particular, he can make whiskey in a homemade still and sell off what he don't drink. - Well let's say I'm a farmer. - Alright sir, let's say so. If you was to follow that road straight out there, you'd come to a tenant farm you could work if you're so minded. Belongs to a man by the name of Varner. - What doesn't? - What's the name son? - Quick. (slow suspenseful music) Ben Quick. (slow suspenseful music) - Quick. So that's him. - Jody, I'm home. (soft music) I just about bought out the department store. And then I moved on to the specialty shops. Now sit down honey and close your eyes. I want to model my purchases. - I hope it's the Papa coming home tomorrow. Things are so different here when it's just you and me. You know something, I hate this house when you're not in it. - Well I'm in it now. And I'm gorgeous. You're gorgeous. - I bet you say that to all the boys. (laughter) - Would you take off your shirt please? - Stop. I'm not wearing those. - Oh yeah? (laughter) - What in the world is going on up there? - Well, we don't exactly go in for stately quiet around here. You know that party's been going on every since Papa went to the hospital. - Well speaking of your father, when is that old Gus personage coming home? - Tomorrow. The forecast is storm and thunder. He'll roll into the house and rattle all the windows. I can just hear him. Aren't you engaged yet? - Well we are still on the green side of 30, so there's time to contribute our bloodlines to the future. - How's Alan? - You mean is he still in the 20th century? No, my brother is lost in the 19th writing that tortuous document. Well you'd think he was writing a best seller, for heaven's sake. And there's no sex in it at all. Start dating other men. - What other men? - Ask and you shall receive. - [Noel] Don't babble the Bible to me, Agnes. The lord doesn't shine on blasphemers. - [Agnes] Don't swim around, but there's someone coming. Someone young. - [Noel] Probably a sewing machine salesman. - Even if it is, we can at least talk to him. - Go ahead. - Y'all look like two butterflies that just laid on the grass. Well hello again, Ms. Noel. - If it's work you're looking for, see the foreman at the gin. If it's food, go to the back door. - What I want is the man of the house. - Jody. There's a person out here to see you. - [Jody] Tell him to wait in the hall. - You could have said gentleman with the same amount of wind. (soft music) You Varner? - I'm one Varner. Eula, turn that thing down, would you girl? (laughter) What can I do for you? - I heard you got a farm for rent. - Where you been farming? - West. - Texas? Eula, turn that thing down before I come up there and kick it in. Well how many family you got? - You're looking at it. - Well a man usually puts six or seven hands in the field. - One's all you'll get out of me. - Jody, you got a store to talk business in. Oh heaven's sakes, it's our passenger. - Hello again, Ms. Eula. I'm glad to see you again. - You know him? - Noel and I obliged him with a ride, it being such a nasty day. - Well you're too soft hearted, honey. You two girls are lucky he wasn't some sort of raving maniac. Go on, get out of here. We got business to talk. How much rent you aiming to pay? - How much you renting for? - Half your crop, all your shopping at my store, no cash. - Food and tobacco your prices? Make my dollar worth about 50 cent. - Take it or leave it, mister. - I'll take it. Quick, Ben Quick. (slow suspenseful music) - [Eula] Jody, I got something up here for you. (slow suspenseful music) (soft music) - Take him in the rug. - (inaudible) getting here lady. Summertime. Living is easy. - Drop it, Adrian. My father comes home tomorrow, and he sets quite a store by this rug. You tracked it, you clean it. - A lot of fuss about a rug, lady. If it's the rug that's bothering you. - What else would it be? - Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but I get the feeling I rile you, me being mean and dirty and all. - Mr. Quick, you're being personal with me, so I'll be personal with you. I've spent my whole life around men who push, and shove, and shout and think they can make anything happen by acting that way. So I'm not anxious to have another one around the place. - Ms. Noel, slam the door in a man's face before he even knocks on it. - Please have the rug at the house by tomorrow morning, thank you. - You ruined it. - Folks think that much of a rug, they shouldn't put it where other folks can tromp on it. - Don't get smart with me, boy. This'll cost you. I'm taking 30 bushels of corn out of that crop you haven't even planted yet. Now maybe that'll teach you. - You're a hard man to deal with. - Yeah, you just keep it in mind. Damn. I had to send that cursed rug to the dry cleaner. All the old man has to do is see that first thing and he'll be blighting up my blood with it. Well, you rearranged some things out here. Looks good. - Thank you, Jody. Now if you were Papa and everything looked good, you wouldn't say anything. If everything looked bad, I wouldn't hear the end of it. - I know he's coming home. I know he's gonna ask questions. I ain't gonna get rattled. I'm just gonna take my time and think my answers through, and everything. I've been in charge three months. I think there's been a big change in me, don't you think. - Oh yeah, Jody. Everything looks real good. You've done real well. - I'm halfway between feeling glad, and sick. I want to see him and I don't. My inside's all mixed up like a dog's breakfast with regards that man. - It's odd. Most people are supposed to love their father. We're mostly just afraid of ours. - Well you got more cause than me. You supposed to be engaged to Alan Stuart by now, and I don't see no ring on your finger. The old man will snarl, little sister. (sirens blaring) - Hello boys and girls. I'm back. - [Boy] Hey Mr. Varner. - Hi. Hi boys. Good to see you. - Howdy. (siren blaring) - [Woman] Is that you, Varner? - You got any doubt? Come closer. Oh. - Wonder what they cut out of him at that hospital in Memphis? - Wasn't his pocketbook, I can tell you that. - All I been looking at is anemic nurses. - Yeah, I hear you been cutting stitches. Anything left of you worth having? - You just wait and see. I got to go up to the house. I'll be back later. - I'm glad you're home, you hunk of beef. - Isaac. - Yes sir. - You work hard for Miss Minnie, you hear me. - Yes sir. - [Mr. Varner] See ya. (siren blaring) - I never hugged a man in a red robe before. - Oh, you're dressed to beat all hell, girl. - In honor of you. - That's the kind of homecoming I was hoping for. That's what I like, a real woman. Bones with some cover. - Hello, Papa. - Hello Papa, well there is a fulsome greeting. There is a hallelujah chorus, not exactly a son pining for his daddy, but simple and direct. - He said hello, didn't he Papa. - Yeah, could we get through the opening ceremonies without recreating the battle of Vicksburg? - I'll get to you in a while, sis. - I know you will, Papa. - Jody's been an absolute living doll since you been gone, Papa. - Well, that's what I call a glowing recommendation. Except I just had a look around town. I saw one dead asleep clerk in the general store, a sign on the gas pump that said out of order, and no one at the saw mill, and it's high, high noon. Rise late today, did you Jody? - Well things may have slacked off a bit today because I was home seeing to your arrival. But we did alright, you can have a look at the books. - Well, I intend to. I intend to crawl over them books like a fly over fly paper. Now they gutted me over there in Memphis. They took out every part they thought they could spare, but they didn't pair down my spirit none. Don't you think you can get up on me, Jody. I'm a better man than you are still. - So you been telling me since I was a boy, Papa. - Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. And I thank you for your kind inquiries as to my health. - Well Papa, I do hope you're feeling better. Didn't I call you every day at the hospital? - Yeah that was right kind of you. Except I never did see your face the whole time I was plopped in a hospital bed. Your sister came. Made a fool of herself, passing out. But at least she passed out there where folks could see she was a dutiful daughter. - Well fact is, I couldn't leave my wife. - Well that situation hasn't been prevalent since your wedding night. Is she pregnant yet? - Papa. - Lord. - Next. - What's on your mind, missy? - Well, what do you want to know, Papa? - [Both] Have you seen any men? - Any men seeing you? Have you been to any picnics, parties or bazaars? Any raffles? Any barbecues, any dances? Have you mingled, have you mixed? Have you kept to your room reading poetry, or grading your papers from the summer school? (laughter) - I hope this doesn't come as a great shock to your nervous system, Papa, but when you're not here, I do exactly what I want to do. - Well I'm back. Now you get a ring on your finger girl, and get me some grandchildren soon. I'm time. Time though. Time. - Faster for you than for me. - Maybe so. - You don't give me my respect in front of my wife. - Well I like women too, but you don't ever give her no rest. I took time out to build up this place to make my mark. I never seen such connubial bliss that you enjoy son. Oh well, that's your private life. I'm interested in our business ventures. I didn't lay flat on my back in that hospital. I acquired some standing pine, which we'll cut at a future date and some horses when a tenant couldn't make his note. Now that's what I did. What did you do? - Well, May has slacked off. But June, and so far July are making up for it. - It's to be expected. - I sold off all our heavy farm equipment. We're fresh out of inventory. - Including that tractor that won't go up the hill? - Including that. - Well, well done Jody. Well done. There was a fella from Boston just bursting with intelligence who bought a lot of land and put 40,000 feet of fence around it to start a goat ranch. Only he ran out of goats, and went bust, and returned that great distant state of Massachusetts. So we own another 2,000 acres of good grassland. - Well, bet he was a college educated man, too, wasn't he. (laughter) Well, Jody. Jody, you ain't just been sitting on your spine all together, have you. - No sir. How'd you rent off that farm? - On shares. - Oh, profitable. - I had a little trouble with the man. I penalized him 30 bushels of corn. - Good. Good. We're already ahead of the game. Now what is the name of this poor unfortunate? - Quick. Ben Quick. - Ben Quick? - From out west. - Quick? Don't you keep abreast of anything but Eula? Flames follow around a Quick like fleas follow a dog. Hellfire, he's a barn burner. He settled his account with a torch and you had to go and stir them up. - The only thing burning around here is your temper. You want to hear something? I sweat when I'm around you. All those months you were in the hospital, I was dry. Now I'm sweating again. Will you kindly tell me what it is you want out of me, Papa? - I can't stop to analyze you or listen to your personal problems. - Well someday you're gonna have to stop. Someday I'm gonna make you stop. - Not right now. You started something with Ben Quick, and I gotta finish it before this house of mine goes up in smoke. (dramatic music) - Hello. - Hello right back at you. I'm Varner. - I already met three Varners. - I'm the Varner. Thought I'd come by and see what your plans are. - This house ain't fit for pigs. - Yeah, we can discuss that. I aim for us to get along. - I can get along with anybody. - I heard somewhere that you had a little trouble, trouble that brings around the fire department. - If you're scared of me, Mr. Varner, why don't you just come right out and say so? - Now why would I be scared of you, son? - Cause I got me a reputation for being a dangerous man. - Is that a fact? Well, you are a young dangerous man. But I'm an old one. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Justice of the Peace. I'm a farmer. I own most all the land that you can see. And what I don't own, I option. I own the gas station, the general store, the saw mill, the gin. And it is bad luck to do your trading anywhere else. That's who I am. - You can talk too. - Yeah, I can. And I'd like to add one more salient point to this most edifying conversation. If anything at all happens to catch fire during your stay here, I am tossing you in my jailhouse and I never heard the words habeas corpus. You'd rot. - Smart man would give me a job. - Yeah? You're working for me already. - Well, let's say a job more conducive to my mental abilities. I pass through that town of yours, some of the people you got working for you got cobwebs on them. You could use me, Mr. Varner. And you'd be writing yourself a fire insurance policy and a bargain. - Well, I'll think on it. - Yes or no, Mr. Varner? Nothing in between. - Now look here, boy, nobody's ever been able to brow beat me with any degree of success. - Maybe that's cause nobody ever tries. - Well, I do happen to have in my possession 30 Texas ponies due to a foreclosure. Now if you were to dispose of them for me at a reasonable profit, you'd be in business. - Sounds easy. I thought I'd have to kill someone for you. - We won't start out with red handed murder. And easy is relative son. Relative. I'll give you a whirl. (soft music) - Have you ever seen so much energy? And on plain grass too. No sweet feed here. Why, there ain't a lazy one in the herd. Son you don't want to be doing that. You're libel to fall in there and spook them. Why until you know a horse real good, you wouldn't want to do that in your own barn. - Buy me one, daddy, buy me one. - They look pretty wild to me, son. - Well these little ole ponies? Well now they're high. I'll grant you that. But they ain't been worked in weeks. Hell, even I get high if I haven't been worked in weeks. (laughter) No sir, all you got to do is work with them and they gentle right down. I wouldn't hesitate to put my own sister on one. Well that is if I had a sister. (laughter) - You know, Will, the only thing worse than a horse trader is a downright thief. Now when'd you get into this business? - Minnie, this is no ordinary commercial venture out there. This is a spectacle. - [Ben Quick] I'm talking 100% sound. Why there isn't a bad one in the bunch. All you got to do is work with them and they'll work for you. - We good? - Isaac, put that wagon up now. - So you can bend them to your ways. - Maybe you're trying to cheat us Quick, maybe you ain't. Those horses out there make me think of a horse my cousin brought me from Texas. I'll give you $75 for that spotted one out there. - You mean that appaloosa over there? - [Old Man] Yeah. - Why he's worth a hundred. - 150 for that chestnut with the blaze. Looks like she's got a little bone to her. - Well, if you know something about horses, how about 50 bucks for this little buckskin here. - [Man] 75. - Alright, alright. Now one at a time, folks. Let's start with that appaloosa over there. Who'll give me a $100 for him? Let's start the bidding at a hundred. - [Man] I'll give you a hundred - We got a hundred dollars right here. Who'll give me a hundred and a quarter? - [Man] Hundred and a quarter. - Hundred and a quarter over here. - [Man] I'll give you a 150. - [Ben Quick] 150 right back to you. Alright. - [Man] I'll give you 175. - 175. Going once. Going twice. Going three times. Sold the appaloosa to the gentleman in the hat standing over here. - How you doing, Petey? - Fine, Mr. Wilson. - You know Arm, it doesn't seem fair you buying your boy a horse, you can't even pay your damn bills, does it. - Wilson, I'll buy my son whatever I damn well please. You'll get your money. - Yeah, well I better get it. - Look at you, snapping and scratching and fighting. Remind me like a banty rooster. You're all hot and sweaty. - Yes I am. - If it wasn't a public place, I might feel compelled to take advantage of you. - Listen, Eula, why don't you just give me a real hot kiss on the mouth, right here in public. - Don't be ridiculous. - Am I gonna see you tonight, honey? - Maybe. Maybe not. - Alright, I'm all square with everybody except you three gentleman right here. I believe it's 200 from you. 150. That's right. 75. 75. 200, thank you all kindly. Thank you all kindly. Now remember what I said, if they give you any trouble, just hit them over the head a couple times with a two by four to get their attention. After they get used to you, you won't have any problems, in a couple of years or so. Hello, Ms. Noel. Are you sure I can't sell you something? - You don't need my money. You got everybody elses. - Yeah, but it's the hold out that challenges me. - Mr. Quick, the last time I parted with my money to a pitchman, I was 12 years old. - And nobody's taken you since. - And nobody's going to. - Well, now life is very long and full of salesmanship, Ms. Noel. You might buy something yet. After you ma'am. - [Older Woman] Thank you. (group chatter) (slow suspenseful music) - You're right impressive. I don't know that I've ever seen anybody do such a good job selling, you were even selling yourself. - Get out of here. (slow suspenseful music) - Should have listened to me back there at Taylor. I told you then that you can me could do a lot of business together, like the old days, Quick and son. You had to run. - The only reason you found me is cause I didn't change my name like the others did. I just as soon forget you, forever. - I'm unforgettable. - I got business to attend to. - Business (inaudible). You don't fool me boy. (group chatter) - Easy now. - Hey Ben. Where's the cash? - Afternoon Ms. Littlejohn. You're no better than a crook. - You're no better than a con man if you can sell my crooked merchandise. - Enough with the name calling. Where's my cut? - I got something for you. Excuse us, Minnie. Come on with me, boy. (group chatter) - [Man] Get that gate, boy. (dramatic music) (group chatter) - Come on. - Outta here. (dramatic music) (group chatter) - [Man] Catch him. - Now the man who built this place back in 1830 had the wit to die before the Civil War. When Grant overran the country on his way to Vicksburg, those people, the Von Pours, they buried all their gold and silver. Now after the excitement and confusion of the moment, they dug up the silver, but they never could remember where they buried the gold. It might have saved them if they remembered. Of course then, I could never bought the place back in 63. - What's all this got to do with me? - Well, I've been watching you, Ben. You got brass and style and push. Not too dissimilar from the way I operate. Been here only a few days, already you grown an inch. That's because you listened to me. Now you keep on listening to me, and maybe one day in a burst of generosity, I'll give you this place. - Thanks a lot. Damn place is falling apart. - Yeah, with your native shrewdness, I know you'll find a way of getting some good out of it. - Mr. Varner, you been making me a lot of promises. One of these days, I'm gonna collect on them. - I'm well aware of that. Come eat at the big house, son. - Noel, honey, could you please come try to do this for me? Thanks. You going to a funeral? - I thought I looked elegant. - Elegant? Girl, rip that dress off your back. Elegant is for old ladies. You're young. You need a little flash. - Eula, you got enough flash for all of Frenchman's Bend. - Now don't try to turn my head when I'm making feminine suggestions. This dress is just too concealing. - Well, I'll tell you a burning secret. I'm not hiding much. - Well whatever there is, it'd look better with more of it showing. - Well thank, Eula. I just wouldn't feel like myself. - Somebody new is coming. - So is somebody old. - Oh Noel. Don't you think Alan's a tad slow? Now that new boy's a flash. Did you ever see anything like him? One minute we're picking him up on highway 47, and the next minute, he's gonna be drinking wine out of your mamma's French crystal glasses. - Well he's certainly got his foot in the door. - In the door? Honey, I'd say he pulled himself a chair right up to the table. - [Jody] Thanks, Vena. - [Man] Dammit boy. Come back here. - There goes another one across the creek bridge. - Then again healthy exercise out there. Give me your glass Ben. They'll sleep better tomorrow night, provided they get back home by then. Well, well, who's drinking more wine? You're partial to my wine, aren't you Alan? Here, give me that glass. How long you been drinking? About a year and a half, I'd say, there abouts. - I've enjoyed your hospitality for a long time. - Tell me Alan, do you go to any other houses? I ask myself do we get the major part of your attention, or are you brightening up other parlors in the town. - Papa, that is Alan's private business. - Why, Alan knows a friendly inquiry when he hears one, don't you Alan. - When I hear one. (laughter) - Well then am I to understand that you stay pretty close to home with your mamma when you're not here? - I can't stand this. - I think you forget that my mother's a widow, Mr. Varner. She relies very strongly on me and my sister. - Hell, she's no widow. Your old man disappeared. He's not dead. He's just wondered off. - The result is the same. She's alone. - No she isn't. She got you. She sure has you, Alan. - I try my best. - Not around here, you don't. Well Jody, you seem to be getting a lot of enjoyment out of my conversation. I believe I'll direct a little of it at you. - Papa, I didn't say anything. - Mr. Quick here is my new manager in the general store right along side you, same salary, same benefit. (dramatic music) That's don't seem to strike you funny. - No sir, it doesn't. - You can sleep late tomorrow, if you think you can afford to. Outside everybody. Let's enjoy the evening air. (soft music) - [Men] Eula. Oh Eula. - It's terrible the way they carry on. Sometimes they even follow me around in town. - Don't go anywhere then. Stay put. Stay home. - Oh honey, they're only 16 or 17. They're harmless. - You call that harmless? - [Boys] Oh Eula. - Boys, quit that now, or I'll pass up on you with a shotgun. That goes for any boy that gets too close, understand. - Oh bear cheese. - [Boys] Eula. - Tom Shortly, Kenny Bookright, and Stu and your brother Cooper, I know it's you that's out there. Now stop it. Now. - [Boys] Eula. - I'll stop it. You boys run off now or your hides are mine. - It's a madhouse around here. - They're young boys. Just young, healthy animals. - Are they hollering on anybody else's doorstep, or they hiding in anybody else's garden? No, just this house. We're the ones who are singled out. - We're the ones that got Eula. - It's not her fault, it's yours. They come here because they know you'll laugh, no mater how crude or how vulgar. - Why, I was young myself once. I used to hide in the bushes there and hoot and holler. - I bet you did. I bet you yelled the loudest and stayed the longest. - Your momma listened. Well, Ben, let's go in. They have their business, we got ours, come on. (soft music) - Those boys certainly made their desires known. I wonder what they would do if Eula did get up and go with them? - I'd imagine they'd be quite a round. (laughter) (soft music) - I know why I made such a fuss about it. - Cause it offended you. You're not the kind to be hollered at from the bushes. You're lovely, quiet, self contained woman. - I guess I'm just anxious. This summer's not turning out the way I was expecting at all. I guess I'm just confused about you and me, Alan. - I know what. When I finish my manuscript, we'll go to New Orleans for a weekend. That ought to alleviate your anxiety. How would you like that? - Oh, I would like that. We could go down and sit by a Lake Pontchartrain. Let nature take its course. - Nature is taking its course with you, and you'll see everything you want will be coming your way. - Blackjack. - Alright, what do you say we deal off the top this time. - Hm? - It's the way you acquired your fortune? It's damn sure the way you're acquiring mine. - Ah, evening Isaac. - Ms. Minnie say where you at. - [Mr. Varner] Well now I'm home. - Ms. Minnie say you come now or she lock up. - Oh, she's gonna lock me out. Well Isaac, you go on back and you tell Ms. Minnie that I'll be there when I'm there. - That's a sad sight. A grown man with the mind of a child. Is he kin to Ms. Littlejohn? - No, no, he was left here about 23 years ago. His mother must have been unmarried or known he was afflicted. So Ms. Littlejohn took him in. She's a kind woman. My wife was kind like that. Guess women are. They have to make up for us. You married? Nope. Got a woman someplace? - I live single. - You like women though? I mean you've known a few, haven't you. - My fair share. Deal. Heat brings out the mosquitoes. Attracted to the light. (soft music) Your friend left early. - I was kissed goodnight, Mr. Quick. - Kissed and left. Me, I'd stayed til sun up. - My, aren't you reckless. - Aren't you? - No, I'm skiddish, Mr. Quick. Just plain skiddish. - I got an answer for that. Let's go jump in your convertible and plow up the countryside. - I think there's been enough commotion around here tonight. - You want quiet, let's go find us a needle in a haystack. - Those are both lovely and colorful suggestions, but they are not exactly in keeping with my character. And I don't think I should be out of character on such a night. - Oh come on, lady get out of character, get way out. - Sudden changes are not in my character, Mr. Quick. - Hell, you never know until you try. (soft music) You mean Mr. Alan Stuart wouldn't like it if you went running off with me. - I don't want to discuss him with you. - Well why not? I respect him, admire his manners. I admire his profession. I admire that big old house he lives in up there. But if you're saving it up for him, honey, you got your account in the wrong bank. - You can leave any time now. (soft music) - Don't ask me twice. (soft music) - What time did Alan leave? - He has to get up early. He's under a lot of pressure with his work. - You want to go for a drive with me? The stars are so big and shiny tonight, looks like you might just reach right on up and grab them. (soft music) ♪ Your baby ♪ ♪ But a Dixie melody ♪ - Well, Noel, we're there. Thousands of acres, millions of seeds down in the ground. Every year they come up. They bear. Where's my crop? - Papa, my birthdays come and go, my life comes and goes, and yet this is the only conversation we ever seem to have. You know I'm quite a lively, intelligent woman. - Well what gets said between you and Alan? Anything? Anything of importance? - He thinks I'm a lovely, quiet, self contained woman. (laughter) - Well. If your blood is so delicate and frail that it calls for Alan Stuart, amen. So be it. I'll give you a big wedding. But it's gonna happen now. No more pussy footing, missy. You stirred him up. If you get no for an answer, it's gonna be the other one. - Which other one? - That big, strong red blooded animal I brought around the table tonight. - My god, you can't mean that-- - Can't I? I want to get some strapping men in this family. I'm gonna feed iron into this family's veins. - You talk like your selling me like one of those damn horses. Don't you care what I feel, what I am? - I ain't selling you, missy. I'm saving you. - Oh, is that what you tell yourself? - Now you're gonna get me grandsons, Noel. - Or granddaughters? - You can get them by way of Alan, or get them by way of the other one, but you're gonna do it. - Christ. You've been playing with me for too many years, Eula, too many years. - I play with you Wilson cause you enjoy being played with. - No I don't. - You want me to quit honey, just tell me. - You know, Eula, I've been in love with you since I was a boy. But I'm tired of looking at you from a distance. I'm tired of having you whenever it suits your damn spirit. So what I'm saying to you is I want you to leave Jody. - I told you a thousand times, Wilson, I love my husband. - Look at me. You love me. - Differently. I got the life I want Wilson with the man I want. I'll never leave him. - Leave him or the property that comes along with him? - Oh shut up and kiss me. - No, no, I ain't kissing you no more. And I ain't shutting up. I'm the one, Eula. I'm the one that needs you, not Jody. It's me. - Jody needs me. - Honey, he can't even satisfy you. I'm the only one that makes you happy. Isn't that the truth. You know sometimes, I don't know whether I should kiss you, or I should kill you. - Kiss me first. (soft music) - You're crazy. - You going to work today, honey? - I go to work every day, don't I. - Well, I don't know. The way you're looking at me, I thought maybe you had something else in mind. I know for a fact you didn't sleep well last night. - Do you. - Why you tossed and turned all night. Don't you remember? It was so hot, I finally got up and went out to the pond. I must have fallen asleep there til almost sunrise. So I know you couldn't have slept well. - Papa's home. You know I don't sleep well when he's around. - Oh, honey let me take care of you. Then you'll sleep well. - I had one of those dreams last night. One of those shadow dreams about Papa and me. I hate when I have dreams like that. - Oh honey, hush. - You know, sometimes when I'm by myself, I try to remember a time when Papa and I didn't fight. I can't. I can't remember a time when I didn't feel like this - Shh, shh, shh, it'll be alright. - Now he's throwing me in the ring with this Quick like I was some sort of pit bull. He ain't gonna be happy until one of us draws blood, Eula. - Your Papa's been steamed up like a 40 ball tomcat, but he'll calm down. - He's an original conman. He's got three shells on the table, and the pea's in his pocket. - Forget Ben Quick. Concentrate on me, you hear. - Damn him. - You just need me to take care of you, that's all. Don't you want me to take care of you Jody? - Always in a shadow. Damn Ben Quick all to hell. - It's the early bird, Jody. - Jody. Jody, I need to talk to you. - Yes, Ms. Howlett, what can I do for you? - Now Jody, we having a hard year. And I know you heard about my illness. - Yes, Ms. Howlett, and I'm glad to see you're recovering. - I'm scared my health gonna run us into the poor house. My poor Army works so hard. And then 150 dollars he paid for that horse yesterday, which we ain't seen since then, well we ain't got the horse and we ain't got the money. It's like it was all burnt up. Now how could you take that money? - Now Ms. Howlett, you know I let your account run six months overtime. I often give Pete free candy. You've been treated very kindly at this store. And I'm deeply wounded to think that you could believe that I would cheat you on a wild horse. Now the trouble is, we got an outsider here. And he don't know anything, he don't care anything about you, and your worries. All he cares about is himself, and getting ahead. Now Mrs. Howlett, I had nothing to do with that horse auction, now if it's meanness and double dealing that you're upset about, then you talk to the man that did it. That man right there. - A lot of harsh things been said about me, Ms. Howlett. Now if I was to address each and every one of them, it would take up too much of your valuable time. So I'm gonna say this to you. You took your complaints to the wrong department. You see we're under new management here. Now I believe you said you have a $150 problem. Am I right? It's solved. Have a good day. Good will, nothing in the world like it. - You think you got yourself a nice little cozy nest egg, don't you. Careful you don't fall out of it. You are not gonna take over for me. - Hey Quick, bring me a slug of tobacco. - If it's blood you want in this new game of yours, Papa, be careful cause you just might get it. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going over to the saw mill. I don't seem to be needed around here. - What do you say boys, competition is the life of trade. I think you'll find this new boy quick to catch on. It's the same old shop, same old stairs, just got a new broom in it. - 75 cents. - Who the hell's store do you think this is, anyway? - Tobacco's still 75 cents. - Well it ain't yours, yet. - Yes sir, can I help you? - You the man that gave my wife back $150? - Yes sir. - I'm no charity case, mister. - Well I didn't think about it that way. Your wife was dissatisfied with the merchandise, so I simply refunded her money. - Will Varner never refunded a penny to anybody, and I don't want one now. You think I need a handout? Make you feel superior? Make you feel more white? - Well you sure got me there. I sure am white, and I sure can't do a damn thing about it. - I'm gonna work off that money. - I don't know of any extra jobs around here. It appears to be a long, slow summer. - But not for you, Mr. Quick. You come blazing across the sky like a comet, you do. - Look, you're feeling insulted is your problem. Like I said, I considered it a refund. That's where it ends. - Well put it on my account. Howlett, Armistead Howlett. - I know what you're thinking. Alright I'm six months behind. Well I'll pay back every damn miserable penny of it. Now add the money for the horse. - Army. Look, it's time I talked to you about the money you owe me. Don't shut the door on me. Listen to me. - I don't want to see you right now, Wilson. - You don't want to see me? You owe me money. No, you owe me. Well that's good, that's good. Catch. - Armistead got anything worth burning? - Not even high summer, and things are heating up in all directions. - Alright, high fly. Good. - I remember watching you play baseball when you was a little kid. Those sexy little uniforms. - Of course. I was a star. - You're sexy. - Get off of me. (inaudible) - Your just as sexy. - Go away. - Give me, give me. (laughter) - Leave her alone. - Come on, come on, come on, come on, you want some. - Stop it. He doesn't understand, Wilson. Wilson he doesn't know what's going on. Stop it. - That's right. Get out of here boy. Get out of here. - Stop it. - Shoe fly. Boy you crazy. You getting crazier, Isaac. - Shut up talking about Isaac like that. Honey, he didn't hurt me. Honey, it's alright. - That boy is so jealous. He wants you, you know that. He's in love with you. You know that? Give me a kiss. Come on, give me a kiss. - Why I like summer school, by V.K. Bookright. I don't. (laughter) - [Wilson] I just can't be without you anymore, you understand. - [Eula] You keep swatting at Isaac, and you're gonna have to learn how. - [Wilson] I don't know what happens. You see I get around you and I just loose control. - [Eula] Now's no time to talk about control, Wilson. - [Wilson] Kiss me baby. - [Eula] Oh honey. - It's rather late to be keeping store. - Yeah I'm just moving some fans down up front so the folks can see them when they first walk in the door, especially the ladies, since they do the household buying. - You seem to know a lot about women. - I know what makes them spend their money. You come in to buy something, Ms. Noel, or you just shopping around? - I was just passing. - It's a hot night. Been drinking some beer. You want some? - No thank you. - Got a sweet tooth? Not only is this store got fans and penny nails, but it's got rock candy, jaw breakers, licorice whips, I do a big business in licorice whips. Or I could sell you a never say die diesel tractor. Or if that's too big, I could sell you a rotor tiller. Or if you prefer gardening by hand, I got a sturdy pair of pruning sheers here. Or how about a sun bonnet? Pretty color, don't you think. (laughter) I just can't sell you nothing, can I. - Can I have a DC powder, please. I've got a headache. - Yes ma'am. Coming right up. Just knock that back in your throat. I don't get headaches, cause I don't have problems. - Or scruples. - Not those either. - Well I have both. - You got thin skin is what you got. The world belongs to the meat eaters. And if you got to take it raw honey, take it raw. - I couldn't live that way. - Well now Ms. Noel, let's examine how you do live. You drive around the country in that car of yours like it had wings. You sit on the veranda with Agnes Stuart all day drinking lemonade. And you watch the whole world go by paired up. You're young. These are golden years. And you're being asked to play a waiting game. But why wait. (soft music) School's out. Night's falling. There ain't nobody around to see if you make a mistake. Leave your books alone, Noel Varner. I'm gonna kiss you. - Damn you. - Men are damned if I do, and damned if they don't. (soft music) - Alright, I'm human. You proved it. - Yes ma'am. You are human. - Barn burner. - So you heard about me. I got flames behind my head. I don't like the color of a man's clothes, or the way he looks at me, why I just breathe fire. Where I've been, there's smoke and cinder and the ground is black. Where I've been, nothing stands, isn't that right. (dramatic music) - [Mr. Varner] Anything you break, you gotta pay for. - How long you been sitting there? - [Mr. Varner] Long enough. - You hired me to tend your store, I'm tending it. That doesn't need any supervision. - I see you've been having a few words with my girl. - A few. - She don't call to you none, now does she. - Yeah, well there's no love lost. - Well that don't have to slow you down none. I'm putting you for as a candidate. - What office you got me running for? - Well now I've opened a lot of doors for you and you pass through them. You got to ask yourself why I done that. - Alright, why? - I'm a man with a purpose. - We all got some mission in life. - Care to hear yours? - What do you think you'd like me to do, if you was able to make me do it? - Get married. And have sons. - Well I'll be damned. - With every possibility of that. But before you are, you're gonna get married up in a church with my daughter, Noel. Now that's the one you didn't figure on. - That's the one. - Move into the house. Live with her. Sleep under clean sheets. Study that girl. You want to put down roots, you want to help yourself to a piece of the cake, you can do it if you listen to ole Will Varner. - You picked yourself a dark horse, father. What do you know about me? - You're young, healthy. Do I need to know anything else? - Not if you're willing to take a chance. - I'd take a chance. Now listen, don't mistake that girl. She's delicate. You be good to her. In her own way, she's fine, like her mother before her. She has quality, and she's the closest you and I will ever come to it. - Looks like I'm in a position to do you a big favor. What's in it for me? - I'm not forgetting you're a man who wants figures and details. Land and moneys on the day of the wedding and more to come. - What land? What moneys? How much more? - You meet with my lawyers, you'll see for yourself. - I'll take that old Frenchman's place for a start. - Done. I ain't quibbling with you. I'll make you my heir. And I'll put that down in writing. - You do that. - You tell me I got the wrong man. You and me got a deal, Ben Quick. Who said marriages are made in heaven? - Hell wouldn't have this one. (soft music) Good morning. Just so we don't crowd each other, I shave at nights and shower in the morning. - Bringing him here into the house. - It's a big house. We got room for one more. He's hired help. He don't belong here. - Oh he's much more than that, Jody. He's a man of property now. - What are you talking about? - Frenchman's Place. I gave it to him. - Frenchman's Place was mine. - Frenchman's Place was mine to give as I saw fit. - How much more you gonna give him, Papa? - As much as he requires. He's gonna be a brother to you, boy. So look out. He'll be awake when you're sleeping. He's gonna be where you ain't. So look alive, Jody. You two is race horses starting out even. We'll see who's faster or smarter. - It's not exactly even, considering I'm your blood son. - Honey, didn't you hear me calling you? - My mind was elsewhere. - Well move it on over in my direction. Straight from Memphis to my body to entice your body. - No doubt about it Eula, you do have a gift. - Gifts are to be unwrapped, Jody. Care to see what's inside the package? - It's too hot. - Honey, it's gonna be too hot all summer long. I wasn't aware my touch was so repulsive to you. - This may come as a surprise to you, Eula, but there's more to life than your biological needs. - There was a time my biological needs gave you a great deal of pleasure. You know what I think. I think you're afraid there's a better man in this house. And I sure don't mean your daddy. (soft music) - You look pretty with your glasses on. You look pretty with them off. You look so young, Ms. Noel, all curled up there in your bed. Just like a little girl. I bet you was just as cute as a bug's ear when you was a little girl. Bet your hair hung in a tangle down your back. It ought to be a church bazaar coming up. You wear a white dress and put a ribbon in your hair, and I'll waltz you around under the moon. (soft music) Noel. Noel. Noel. (soft music) I'll be right with you. I thought I told you to go to hell. - It's a little crowded down there. I'm still here in Frenchman's Bend. - You're looking to get cut in on some action. Well it ain't gonna happen. - I'm getting old boy. Now you can fix me up with something without too much terrible trouble, before I go carrying around a pitchfork. - You never gave anything to me, or momma or the boys. So I'm returning the favor. - I could make life sizzling hot for you boy. You're angling for the main chance here or I blow it. It won't take much to keep me happy. - Why don't you just turn your carcass around and march out of here before somebody gets hurt. - Is that a fact? - That's a fact. - Well I just might out do myself, make you wish you were never born. - Whatever I gave you wouldn't be enough anyway. You'd want more. - Like father, like son. I wouldn't go down with Will almighty Varner, would it. You're a rotten son, you'll make a rotten son in law. (dramatic music) - You just give me a little more time, Wilson. The hospital bill caught me off guard. - Army, Army, I'm not running some kind of charity ward here. Now I'm as sorry as anybody else that your wife took ill when she did. But you're two months, son, two months behind in your mortgage. - How about if I paid you off a little bit at a time, just for a while, until I can get back on my feet? - I need money just like you do. - You know, I have to ask myself how come you're so mean Wilson? - Mean? - Mean. You'd skin a maggot. And then I ask myself why does a man like you, a smart man, keep hanging around this town. And why are you always lending out money to black folks? - Well after my experience with you, I might not lend to the black man anymore. What do you think of that? - The hell you won't. Now you got a burn on Wilson. You think maybe if you can get rich enough, you can get her back. - Now you shut your mouth because it doesn't matter what I think, and it doesn't matter what I do, you understand. I'm the only one who lent you money when nobody'd give you nothin. No bank in this county, no other bank anywhere else gonna give you a dime. It was me, Army, me. Now look, you got 10 days to come up with $1200 or you consider yourself and your whole damn family a bunch of homeless niggers. You understand? That's right, homeless. - Just odds and ins, Mr. Quick. Things we can live without, but never do. - Well, in the future, Mr. Stuart, feel free to call in your order. I know you got a schedule to keep. - I'll do that. It would appear you find the Varner's a fascinating, rewarding association. - Not all of them. - Noel, perhaps. I might quote the old sage, it's just as easy to fall in love with a rich woman as it is a poor woman. - I guess you could quote that. - Your reputation precedes you, Mr. Quick. I don't imagine too many women find that appealing. I care very dearly for Noel Varner. - You got a funny way of showing it, Mr. Stuart. - I intend to take Noel to New Orleans when I finish my book. I think that'll give us the opportunity to sort out our feelings for each other. - Sort out your feelings? Either you love a woman, or you don't. - You're much too clever, Mr. Quick. But I wouldn't be so sure of myself if I was you. - Mr. Quick? - Mr. Wilson Mahood? - Yes sir. Pleased to meet you. I understand you've been looking for me. - Yeah. I got some business to discuss with you, Mr. Mahood. I hear there's a nigger named Armistead Howlett is causing you all kind of trouble. Come in, let's talk about it. - I guess I better do that. (soft music) (laughter) - Give me some of that. - No. - Give it. - No, no, no. - Give it to me. - Give me a little kiss. - I can't. There's too much happening. - What, you come here to talk? I came here to fool around with you, didn't I. - Wilson, there are things standing between us. Everything used to be so easy. Ever since Ben Quick shows up. - [Wilson] Ben Quick, what the hell has Ben Quick got to do with you? - He's a fascinating man, Wilson. One takes notice of men like that. - You don't, you understand me. No, you don't. No, you don't. I'm gonna do a lot more than hurt you if you thinking about any men, especially Ben Quick. - Wilson, I'm just trying to say that if Ben were gone, everything would get back to normal. - Shut up. Uh uh, no more Ben Quick, okay. Don't say his name again. - Ben Quick. Ben Quick. Ben Quick. Ben Quick, Ben Quick. - You know what you do. You tease me and you taunt me, and you drive me crazy, and you think I'm gonna keep coming back, do you. Don't you. Hm? Hm? - You always do. - Damn you. I'm sick of this. - Oh god. - [Eula] Wilson, stop it. Stop it, Wilson. (dramatic music) Stop it. Wilson. What are you doing? - Get up, boy. I said get up, boy. (laughter) (dramatic music) - [Ben] Let's go, Eula. - What'd you do to my wife? - Jody. Jody, quit it. Stop it. Stop it, Jody. Stop it. Ben, quit it. Jody, quit it. Jody, stop it. Stop it. Stop it. - That's right. Protect him, he's your lover, isn't he. - It wasn't Ben. It was Wilson. Jody, he just went crazy. He was wild, he accused Ben of sleeping with me. He attacked me. He went wild, honey. He's just crazy. - Oh baby. I'll kill him. - Jody. - Jody. - [Jody] I'll kill him. - Jody. (slow suspenseful music) (dramatic music) - [Pete] Dad, my horse is in there. Please help me get him out, please hurry. - Right son, get back. Honey, get that hose out here. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. No son, it's too late. It's too late, the blaze is too hot. You can't get your horse, Pete. You can't get him. - [Pete] Daddy. Daddy. (slow suspenseful music) (soft music) (sobbing) (soft music) (inaudible) (knocking on door) - [Jody] This is Jody Varner. Wake up, I got something I want to show you. - What time is it? - It's 4:30. - [Jody] Get on up out of that bed. - Oh hell. - Are you telling me Ben Quick did this? - Did you see him do it? - No. But Isaac did. - Dammit Jody, this whole town's got it in for Ben Quick. And I can't say I blame them. But we're talking murder here boy, and all you're giving me is a word of the town dimwit. - Come here boy. Come here. Come on. Now why don't you tell the man. Did you see Ben Quick dig this hole? - Well boy? - Did you? Did you see Ben Quick stick Wilson Mahood in this muck and try to cover him up? - Boy, you better tell me what the hell went on here. - Go on. - Yes. - Good boy. Good boy, Isaac. Now he may be dimwitted, but he ain't blind. Now you tell me what you intend to do about this, Hampton. (slow suspenseful music) Have trouble sleeping, Ben? - Nope. Just chose to stay awake. - You know why we're here? - I'd say you heard some nasty gossip. - Hey, what's going on here boys? - We're here to arrest Ben Quick for the murder of Wilson Mahood. (slow suspenseful music) - I had that one figured right. - Wilson Mahood is dead and your boy killed him, Papa. - How do you know Ben did it? - Isaac saw him. - Isaac. Isaac's always seeing things. - We're just here to do our duty, Will. Read him his rights. - Now while you're talking rights, keep in mind this is my house, my property. - I got no choice, Will. You know that. (soft music) - You seem mighty relieved to have Ben out of your way. - I think you would be too. You want a killer living under your roof? - Maybe I still got one. - Me? A killer? Why Papa, I love life. I feel life in me. Why for the first time in years, my insides are shaking with life. Get in that house. Get in there. Shaking. I feel good, Eula. - That's good, honey. That's real fine. What do we owe our thanks for this sudden change in fortune? - Cause Ben Quick got what he deserves, Papa put his money on the wrong horse, and came out the winner. - You're hurting me. - Good. I'm taking what's mine. No one's ever gonna stand in my way again. - No. No. No. No. - The last time I saw anything like that was during the war. Thought never to see it again. - It's gonna take some time. - What are you talking about? He's murdered. It's plain to see how. - Why don't you wait for the autopsy, Jody, before you start jumping to conclusions. - He was murdered, Lou. Look at his chest. - I don't know any such thing, Houstin. There's one thing my years in this business have taught me is to expect-- - Hell, you can pontificate all you want. The man was murdered. - Whoever did it knew him. - That's right. - [Mr. Varner] Why's that? - His face is slashed bad. What's left of it. I read somewhere that if the face is disfigured, the killer knew the victim. - Well that don't mean a whole lot. Everybody knows everybody in this town. (radio chatter) - Alright, let's get him out of here. - Damn mosquito. - [Wilk] You're swatting the wrong insect. - Hell, it drew blood. - So did Ben Quick. I don't see you doing nothing about him. - The man's in jail, what more do you want? - Satisfaction. We sit here and allow a stranger to come in and start running our lives for us. Barn burner. Someone who's been kicked out of every other county around here. - That much is true. - We let him in with open arms. And what we got to show for it? Armistead looses his barn. - I got a new one. - Wilson Mahood's dead. - One of our very own and we let it happen. - Look, he's in jail. - But you know he's gonna get off. - And don't think he won't be laughing about it. He's over there laughing already. - Well we can't do much about that now, can we. - We got a town that's been sleeping all through the summer. It's time we woke 'em up. - They got a lot of guns at the jail. - Yeah but we got more. Anybody that's worth his salt around here has got a gun. - Where you going? - You said something about getting a gun, didn't you? - Yeah. Yeah. Come on. We got a job to do. - Ms. Noel. Ms. Noel. - Army? - Ms. Noel, we got trouble. - What? - It's Ben. They're gonna take him. You better come quick. - I'll be right down. (crowd yelling) - I got this here rope to pick out a horse I bought, remember. (crowd yelling) It seems to me it's no more than right we use it on the man that I bought that crazy broad from. (crowd yelling) Alright, let's go. (crowd yelling) (dramatic music) - Don't look like I'm gonna get much rest today. (crowd yelling) - Don't care. There's no way I'm gonna fire on the. - Come on. We are moving to the next county. On the bars. - Just turn him over to us. (gun shot fires) - Man. - You're not gonna turn that damn thing on us and you know it. - Come on, Houstin, it's my job. (slow suspenseful music) - You still want your job, then let us through. - Well about five of you guys ain't gonna make it. - Go ahead and protect us. We're not scum like Ben Quick. - [Man] That's right. - They're gone. They've head off out back. - Damn. They're headed for Cranson. What the hell we standing here for? (crowd yelling) (slow suspenseful music) - [Armistead] What are we gonna do when we get there? - Damned if I know. Why are you so anxious to save Ben Quick, Armistead. He burned you out. - A barn burner don't go around talking people into building a new one. - He did that? - It was his idea. He took no credit for it. (dramatic music) The question is, if he's a barn burner, if he killed Wilson Mahood, why are you helping him? Watch it. (slow suspenseful music) - My God. My god. Ben. Ben. Oh my god. - He's got cuffs on him. - Get some keys or something. You're gonna be alright now. - Is that you coming down the road? - [Armistead] Hey, give us a hand. - It's just like you, Noel Varner. Hang on. - Hurry. - There's a guy on the other side. Okay. Let's get him up. They're coming. We better get out of here. - Get on that phone. Keep trying until you get somebody and get an ambulance down here. - Right. - You're gonna make it? - [Ben] You bet. (soft music) - Hello, hello. Anybody there? We got an accident here. Sunshine bridge. Come in, we got an accident over here. We need some help. (soft music) (crowd yelling) - [Man] Come on boys. Let's get him. Where the hell's Mr. Ben Quick? - [Man] Did he get away? - [Man] Hampton, what's going on? Check the car. - [Man] Is anybody else in the car? - [Man] Is he dead? - [Man] Where's Quick? - [Man] Is Quick in there, look. - [Man] Durn him, where is he? (slow suspenseful music) - Get inside and stay there. I'll be back as fast as I can. - And then what? - I haven't had time to think about that yet. - Maybe you should. - Ben, I've been thinking all my life, so this is a new experience for me. Don't go and spoil it for me by being rational all of a sudden. Go on now, I got things to do. - I'm tired of being jerked around. - Where the hell is Ben Quick? (crowd yelling) - If you had anything to do with turning him loose, boy. You in worse trouble than he is. - I heard tell crisis bring out the best in people. You an exception to the rule, Wilk. - [Man] We want some answers. (slow suspenseful music) - Going on a holiday, Noel? - [Mr. Varner] Oh, what the hell's going on? - Nothing, Papa. - You're in an awfully big rush little sister. You joining the chase, or are you the rabbit they after? - Noel, where the hell you going? - I'm leaving. - You're running away, aren't you? With Ben Quick? She's running away with Ben Quick. That's who those boys are chasing tonight, ain't it. - Let go of me, Jody. - You got him out, didn't you? - No. - You got him here. - You're hurting me, Jody. - Where you got him hid? - [Mr. Varner] That's your sister's business. - Ben Quick is your business, Papa. You think your running after your true love. Hell, he paid for him the same way he paid for the clothes on your back. - Jody. - Why do you think he stuck around all that time? Papa paid him to stick around. - Is that true? - Noel, honey. - Is that true? - Ben Quick is a paid for stud bought by Will Varner to service his only daughter. All for the sake of his immortality. There's only one place that Ben quick can hide out. There's only one place he can call his own. My place. (soft music) - Jody. (soft music) - [Isaac] Ms. Eula. - Oh, Isaac. - I only did what I thought was best for you. - No, you did what you thought was best for you. I want to be left alone. - No. It's been a long silence between us. This is a night for a father and daughter to talk. Noel, ask yourself, what are children for? Why does a man want them? - To give yourself a second chance to right all the mistakes that you made yourself. - There's truth in that. - But you and Jody are living proof of how your momma and me felt about each other. Now I'll tell you something remarkable. That woman loved me. She did. She did, Noel. And if you can love a man and he can love you back, you got nothing to be afraid of. - But they say Ben Quick's a dangerous man. - Hallelujah for it. Now you and I both know Ben Quick's no barn burner, and God see me through this, he didn't kill Wilson Mahood. - I know that. So you did pay for Ben Quick. Well Papa, this time you finally got your money's worth. - Isaac, I can't help you if you won't talk to me. - I, I love you Eula. - I love you too. - I love you. - Love you too. - Love you. (crowd yelling) - What the hell are we standing around here for? We got a killer out there. (crowd yelling) - [Man] Get him. - Let's move it. (crowd yelling) - Don't you think this has gone far enough? - [Man] No. - You're going about this the wrong way. Let's go back to town and get to the bottom of it. - [Man] Let's go get Ben. - You do what you want. We're gonna find Ben Quick. Come on boys. (crows yelling) - I hate, I hate Wilson. I hate him. I hate Wilson. I hate Wilson. I did a bad thing. - What? What Isaac? What? - I did a bad thing. (soft music) - Ben. Ben Quick. Ain't no where to run this time, Ben. - You gonna burn me out Jody? - You ever stick around and see how hot the fire gets, or do you just keep on running and never look back? - You and me are a lot alike, Jody. - Yeah, how's that Ben? - I let my daddy put me on the run my whole life cause I never gave a damn about anything strong enough to fight for it. And you, you stood by and sulked cause you couldn't get your daddy's respect, pretending the whole time that it's his fault. Well it ain't boy. It's yours, and mine. - You shut the hell up. - You want your wife back, take her. You want your daddy's respect? Fight for it. - That's what I'm doing. (dramatic music) This place is going down, Ben. - By god, no more. No more. - [Man] Yeah, it looks like there's a fire starting. Yeah, the Frenchman. Let's go. - I'll kill you. I'll kill you, Papa. - Listen to you. Hell it ain't me you're fighting. (dramatic music) - Who is it, Ben? Who is it, huh? Who is it? - Ourselves man. Ourselves. We're killing ourselves cause we can't stand who the hell we are. Oh. Jody. Come on, let's get the hell out of here. (crowd yelling) - Ben. Ben. Come on. - Jody's in there. - Let's get out of here. Come on. - [Ben] Jody's in there. Jody's in there. Jody's-- (crowd yelling) - If you got a prayer boy, you better say it now. (crowd yelling) - Stop. (crowd yelling) - Stop. I said stop. (gun shot fires) - Hey Jody. - Get out of the way. - [Man] Stay out of this Jody. - [Man] Kill him. - What makes you so sure you got the right man? - There's nobody else makes sense, Jody. - Is that what you think? - That's what we all think. - I'm the one that set that fire. - Jody, don't. Listen to me son. - No, once you listen to me, Papa. It's amazing what we got inside ourselves, ain't it. We think we know each other, well here I am. I came here to burn out Ben Quick, but it was you I was trying to burn out, Papa, you and me. - [Man] Hang him. - That don't change the fact that Ben Quick burned Army out. And he killed Wilson Mahood too. (crowd yelling) - Stop. Stop. Stop. Isaac saw Wilson hurting me and he wanted to hurt him back. But he didn't know what killing is. He just kept striking at him. - Hell, you don't expect us to believe that. - Ben saw him do it and he was trying to protect Isaac. Now tell me, you got something against that? - Take that rope off. Take that rope off. - [Man] Hang him up. - [Man] Now let's finish him, come on. - You heard her, take it off. - [Man] Don't do it. - [Man] Don't do it. - Y'all go on home. All of you. Go on, get. - You heard the man. Gonna listen to Wilk here, or Jody Varner? You got a choice, don't make it stupid. (soft music) - [Man] Come on boys, let's go. - Looks like maybe I found my son. - Never knew you lost one, Papa. (soft music) - This time I don't think you could have run fast enough. - I had no intentions of running. - Come on honey. You're coming home with us. - God, I'm sick of this sight. I must have seen it 50 or 100 times. I was 10 years old the last time I saw my daddy til this summer. I remember lying in a ditch, praying to God that I could just disappear. The house was burning. Men was shouting. I remember gunshots and the smell of kerosine, and my daddy running. Before I knew it, I was running too. And I never stopped until I came here. You're a good woman, Noel, hard headed, but a good woman. Since you saved my life, I guess I can return the favor and get the hell out of yours. Will, you were right. There's a fortune in gold in there. I don't want it. Deals off. I ain't for sale no more. See you around. - I'll dog you wherever you go. I'll break you. - No you won't. You'll miss me. - Ben. Ben. (soft music) Run. Run like hell. Buy a bus ticket and disappear, change your name, dye your hair, get lost. And maybe you'll be safe from me. (soft music) (Multicom Jingle)
