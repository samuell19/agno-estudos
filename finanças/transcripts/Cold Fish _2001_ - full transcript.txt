Did you get what you want then? - Yeah. It's gonna be good Jake. I can edit it in couple of weeks? - A week? That's not a problem, is it Alex? - Uh no no no no, no problem. I almost forgot. - What's this? You're having a laugh mate, this is way over the top. We're on a tight budget here. - I thought we had a deal! - Well this is a new deal. You bring me the edit next week, I approve it, the record company approves it, and then and only then you might get half of this. I'm the one doing you a favor, alright? - You know what I like about you, Jake? - What? - Nothing. But that's business, right? How about some expense money? - Yeah, sure. That's for the beer. Go easy. - Hello, I'm Sylvia King, Welcome to Media Scope. Our weekly look at the arts. This week we focus on Jon and Marta Henley, enfant terrible of the art world. The Henleys' return to Britain this month will certainly raise questions as to the media's view of modern art today. Is it becoming the rock and roll of tomorrow? The audience who flocked to the Henley show in Berlin last year seemed to think so where they had the kind of reception normally reserved for pop stars. More importantly, the Henleys' theater of shock will further fuel the debate over censorship in the media. Viewers may find some of the following images disturbing. - Guess who. - Hmm. Tough one. Vialy? Zola? The new Steven Spielberg? Or could it be the bloke who was supposed to have done a dozen copies of this tape the afternoon? - Philistine. - Get back! - Oh so it was you who had it then. - Yeah, I borrowed it for a while. Steinman thinks he sent it out to be fixed so if he asks, that's the story. Who ever resisted the invaders met-- - Okay. So what is it this time? Fly on the wall documentary, cheapo horror flick? Titanic two, the sequel? - Pop promo. I mean this could really put me on the map. - Well I won't hold me breath. Anyway, I'm telling you, you should watch your step, mate. I can't keep covering for you all the time. We could both end up in the shit. - Yeah, you've got a wife, child, and oh, Stanford Bridge season tickets to support. - Speaking of which, they're playing tonight. You coming? - Oh sorry Baz, I've gotta be somewhere. Shit I'm late. - Hang on! How did you get that out of stores in the first place? My flexible friend. - A dozen copies, remember? See ya. - Provocative and direct it may be, but is it art? - Isn't he cute? Can you flirt with the camera? Look into the camera. Look into the camera. Anyway, I'd just like to thank everyone for their support, especially Paul. But there's one other person above all I have to thank, and that's my partner, Alex. I wouldn't exactly call him Mr. Reliable, but I don't know where I'd be now if it wasn't for him. I'm taking it one day at a time and today I'm one year clean. Yes! - Well done. - Congratulations eh. - Well done babe! - What time do you call this? - I'm sorry I'm late. - Alex. On time as usual, I see. Goodnight Jo, and well done. - I'm getting the bloody bus. - Jo. Jo, wait a minute. - Once, just once you coulda made an effort to be on time. You know what Paul says. Oh, Saint Paul. - For god's sake Alex, can't you just make the tiniest effort to get along with him? He's only trying to help me. At least he's not stuck in some bloody studio all hours. What are we doing here anyway? - Look at the monitors, babe. - Very clever. - Oh, you don't like Barbados? Okay, try this. Alright, try this one. - Have you heard a single word I've said? - How about Paris in the spring? Sometimes it rains in Paris so you might need this. - What's that for? - Open it. - Isn't that supposed to be bad luck? - Come on. - Oh, this is beautiful! - Well done darling. One year clean. - You bastard. You let me go on all that time. - Well no point stopping you full flow, is there? - You don't have to take all this shit from me, do you? - Ms. Henley! - Ms. Henley! What's it like to be back in Britain? - Welcome home Marta, lovely as usual. Shall we? - Why do you glorify violence? Is it true that your show might be banned? - How dare you touch me? - What a bitch! - Ladies and gentlemen, as you can appreciate Mr. and Mrs. Henley have had a very long and tiring journey. My office will issue a press release in due course. - Yes, yes. Gas main blew. Right, casualties? Okay. There's a crew on the way. We should have a feed in 20 minutes. What are you still doing here? You should be halfway to FarrinDton by now. - Problem. - Sorry boss, I slipped. - What? - On a pie at the match last night. - Oh christ, that's all I need. So get someone else. - That's the problem. Everyone else is out. - I can handle it. - Oh yeah, he could handle it. - Haggled into your practice, have we? - Morris, I'm a professional. Surely you don't expect me to work with some jumped-up teapot, do you? - Oh come on Morris, give us a break. - Okay. Well I haven't got time to piss about. Get going and Watson, don't screw up. - What sort of pie was it then? - Steak and kidney. - Move it! - Welcome to Media Scope. We're live at the Farringdon gas explosion. - You coming, Alex? - No, I'll catch you up. Jon, Marta. Hi, how are you? - I don't believe we've had the pleasure. - Alex, Alex Watson. Of the Berlin show, absolutely stunning. So how's the new show coming? - If you don't mind my asking, who the hell are you? - I'm with Metro News 24. You might have heard of our arts program, Media Scope? I might have guess. A reporter. How about some background on your new work? No comment. - Just a few words. Free publicity. - Do I have to repeat myself? No comment. Is that clear? - Can I quote you on that? Touchy. This place is getting more like Sarajevo every day. - This place is nothing like Sarajevo. - Oh yeah, you were out there in '95, weren't you? Preparing for the war exhibition? - '96, actually. You have an interest in our work? - I keep up with the arts. Have to. Goes with the territory. Ah yes, you are in television. - Sounds like you don't approve. - I should approve of the jackals in the media who misrepresent us? Call us monsters? Malign our art? - So why not set the record straight? I can see it now, a forum dedicated to you. Jon and Marta Henley, a special-- - We don't give interviews. - Why not? - We like to keep our distance. Our art speaks for itself. It has its own integrity. Unlike most people in your business. - You know what I think? I think you're scared. Scared of people finding out what you're really all about. - Don't be ridiculous. - Well prove it then. Say yes. Say you'll do an interview with me. - You are very direct. Most English people are more oblique. I think that we are very similar, you and I. We see something we want, and we take it. Yes? You must understand our position, Alex. We are very particular about the people that we do business with. But if we were to even consider getting involved with you we would have to come to some kind of understanding. - Let's stop-- - Control. Control. These are the things the Russians will never forget. Never forget. Never forget. - Stop here. My agent is having a party on this Saturday night at eight p.m. Be there. Where to now then, loverboy? - Alex, are you in? Hi. You smell good. - Not now babe. - Who's a shy boy? Oh, are they working you too hard? God you're all knotted up. You just sit there and relax, I'll put the kettle on. Anyway cheer up, Barnaby called. He's invited us over for dinner on Saturday. - Saturday? Can't make it, I've got a meeting. - Another dodgy promo? On a Saturday? Can't it wait? - Well it's not exactly a meeting. - What is it then? - A party or more a soiree. I mean, it's an art thing. Probably be blindingly dull. - A party's a party. Who invited you? - Jon and Marta Henley, the video artists. - How on earth did you manage that? - Well I ran into them today, purely by chance. I sort of told them I was a reporter at Metro. - Alex, you're not a reporter! - Yeah but they don't know that, do they? - The press have been after an exclusive on those two for years. You might just be looking at the man who'll get it. - You'll never pull it off. - Yeah but if you don't try you don't get. - Well then I better come. Moral support. - Uh yeah, you'll get bored babe. I mean, I'll just be talking business. - That's okay. You talk business and I'll socialize. Business party, huh? - How was I to know? - Hello gorgeous. You wanna taste the spiral? - No thanks, had to give it up. Sinuses. - Alex, you know I shouldn't be at a place like this. - Relax. I'll get the business sorted and then we can go. - So where are your famous Henleys then? - Alex. Glad you could come. And who is this? - This is my girlfriend, Jo. Jo, Marta Henley. - Nice to meet you. - Likewise. - I'm afraid I will have to steal your boyfriend for a moment. I have someone he should meet. You enjoy the party. - Marta. Oh have you found me a new friend? - He is not for you. He is my new guest. Alex Watson. - Pleased to meet you Mr.-- - You may call me Ronan. Good to have a new face around. So where did our Marta find you? - Actually we met at the Farringdon gas explosion. - Marta, you do find your friends in the most extraordinary places. I much prefer nightclubs myself. - Alex is a reporter. - A reporter! I deny everything! It was a tissue of lies! - Well don't worry, my lips are sealed. - Mmm, pity. - Quite valuable, I believe. - Looks like shit to me. - A true connoisseur. I think you may find it grows on you. Jon Henley. And you are? - Jo. Jo Davis. - Alex works for Metro News. Quite the rising star, apparently. He is hoping to film an interview with Jon and I. - I wish you luck dear boy. I've been trying to get these two to talk to the press for years. - Well we feel that now may be the time. We feel that we have been hiding away from the public for too long. - I'm here with my boyfriend. He's talking to your wife. - Star reporter. Well then, while they talk business why don't I show you some of the real atrocities dear Roland has so wisely invested in. And you will tell me all about yourself. - Why not? - Alex, Alex Watson? - Patrick. Shifting a lot of gear tonight. - One must make a living. What brings you here? Did somebody order a pizza? - I'm a guest of the Henleys, as it happens. - How thrilling for you. How's Jane, is it? - Jo. She's clean. So stay away. - Must go, duty calls. - You missed some. - Ah, waste not, want not. Asshole. - Patrick. Have you been overdoing things again? - Your guest Alex Watson thinks he's a bloody comedian. He always was a little shit. - Alex? You know him? Tell me more. Jo, I thought I would find you here. Enjoying the party? - It's okay. - Your Alex seems to be entering into the spirit of things. - Yeah, he knows how to have a good time. - Yes, he does. He's a good fuck, isn't he? - Excuse me? - Your Alex. I can see how he has caught a pretty girl like you. He's so virile. I like that in a man. - Your sense of humor is as sick as your so-called art. - Who is joking? - Alex. - Excuse me for a moment. What's up? - You and that bitch Marta, that's what. - Poor thing, must be the time of the month. - Did you fuck her? You bastard. - Jo, you've got it all wrong! - Let go! - Your girlfriend seems a little upset. - What did you say to her? - We were just talking. Perhaps she took something I said the wrong way. Jo, Jo! Down! You've got it all wrong! I mean there's nothing going on! - Nothing going on? It was written all over your face, you lying bastard! So tell me nothing happened, Alex. You can't, can you? - Look! She came onto me. That was it! Look I don't give a shit about the woman! It's just business. - Business? - Yeah I mean if I get in with these two it could put me in the big... We'll be made for life. This is for us, babe. - Us or just you? So all this is just some career move, right? - Yeah! That's as far as it goes. - It's already gone far enough, Alex! - Jo! - Taxi! Take me to Tooting. - Where's your bracelet? - It must have come off at the party. I don't want it anyway. Why don't you give it to your girlfriend? - Come on Jo! - You can send him in now please, Beryl, thank you. Well, the Henleys in their infinite wisdom have decided to grant you an interview. It appears they see a quality in you that seems to have escaped the rest of us. Sign at the bottom of the last page please. - What's this then? - It's the standard agreement giving my clients editorial control over your work, right of veto, that sort of thing. - Shouldn't I be the one to have editorial control? - You're a very lucky boy. Quite frankly I'm not in wholehearted agreement with this, but mine is not to reason why. I only act as instructed. Take it or leave it, dear boy. - Ah, what the hell. - Good. Well you're expected at Benson Station, Oxfordshire. Saturday afternoon, four o'clock sharp. There are all the details. That's it, you can go now, stop cluttering up my office! Go on, shoo! ♪ Super sexy razor happy ♪ - Hey, Orson Welles. Give us a hand with this, will ya? Prophetic. - That's the final version mate. ♪ Super sexy razor happy ♪ - You ready for the big weekend? - Just about. - The Henleys return-- - Jo giving you a hard time about it? - She's hardly spoken to me since the party. She's convinced I've got something going with Marta Henley. - And of course that's the last thing on your mind. - Oh no, not you too. Look. This is a big chance for me. I just wish Jo could understand that. - So what was the taxi wank all about then? And what if she wants a rematch? - Oh do me a favor Baz. I don't even fancy the woman. I just get in, do the interview, and get out. Job done. - If you say so. - Well what would you do? I mean, if you had the chance of a lifetime. - You're asking me for my advice? There's a first. Well I would have to ask myself, do I really want this? I mean come on Alex, you have a new scheme every time the sun comes up. Now what's so different this time? - I just wanna make my mark. - Well then, there's your answer. - I'm a little surprised to see you. I thought your girlfriend might stop you from coming. - Jo? I told her this was strictly business. This is strictly business, right? - Whatever you say. - Do you might if we didn't talk about Jo? I mean, it's a bit delicate at the moment. - You are very protective, aren't you? You worry too much, Alex. Relax. Just enjoy the weekend. - Christ, look out! Are you okay mate? Don't try to move. He's in a bad way. - He shouldn't have been in the middle of the road! - Have you got a mobile? I mean, he needs an ambulance fast. I think there is a payphone further down the road. Right, see what you can do. I am not a nurse. - Just do what you can! What are you doing? Marta? - He died shortly after you left. There was nothing I could do for him. - You're filming him? - I want to immortalize the poor man. Look at him! Such a strong image. Death is a part of nature, Alex. It has its own kind of beauty. Better put that away. - You alright, my darling? That must have been quite an experience. - I feel terrible. That poor man. - So it's our star reporter. Quite a start to the weekend, eh? I must apologize for being somewhat frosty to you in our first meeting. One has to deal with so many undesirables. - I understand. - My wife has convinced me that you're the right man for the job. I trust her intuition completely. We'll do the interview tomorrow afternoon. You've made quite an impression on her, you know. Pictures of the bombardment preceding the landings and Borneo bring us back to the war with a crash. There's Borneo going up in smoke. Borneo was one of the Japs' major sources of supplies. - In my younger days I was considered rather a bad lot. Drinking, gambling, womanizing. You know the sort of thing. I was what they used to call a rake. Inherited wealth can be a lot of fun, you know. General MacArthur in command says if those guns jar him, what are they doing to the Japs? - Then I met Marta, of course. And things changed. Marta was 17. A waif. And a political refugee. Her father was, well. Marta was the only member of her family to escape. Between us we found a focus. For her anger, my energy, and our appetite for new experience. Well the Japs asked for trouble and they're getting it. Atomic bombs included. Meanwhile they got this at A horrifying picture, yes, but the atomic bomb is more terrible still and the Japs must take it or surrender. - Do you enjoy your notoriety? - The public perception of Jonathan and I seems to be colored by the subject matter of our work. People accuse us of being cynical and corrupt when in fact the reverse is true. We are merely passive recorders of the world. A mirror to society, reflecting the basic brutishness of the human spirit. - Do you see any of the redeeming qualities of mankind? - We're artists. We merely record what we see and present it in intensified form. - Some people call it a vision of hell. If that is so, then it a hell of our own making. - So you see yourselves as visionaries? - All I know is that I do what I have to do. Nothing is more important. - The tape, if you please. - Jonathan, you must come and see the footage I shot yesterday. - Goodnight, Alex. - We'll see about editorial control. - Alex, are you alright? - Couldn't sleep. Do you mind? Well I better get my head down. Goodnight. - What's your hurry? Don't feel uncomfortable. We are not exactly strangers. - Look, this is not a good idea. - Oh don't worry about Jonathan. He sleeps like a baby. - Marta, this is not part of the deal. - Oh yes it is, Alex. - No, no. - Come on Alex, relax. Let yourself go. - Hold it. Right there. Taking advantage of the hospitality, aren't we Alex? I think you need a lesson manners. - Look, there's no need for that. I'm sure we can discuss this rationally. - What is there to discuss? You're invited into my house and then I find you in flagrante delicto with my wife. How do you propose to discuss that rationally? How was he? - He gets a little tense. I think it affects his performance. - You need to loosen up. Stress is a great killer, you know. But don't think for a minute that I get jealous over my wife's picadillos. We like to experiment. Don't we, my dear? - But then why the gun? - Can't have you getting too cocky. Need to keep you on your toes. Well I think we should all retire. Long day tomorrow. Sweet dreams. - No appetite today? - Not very hungry. - Don't be petulant, Alex. Doesn't suit you. And how does our reporter feel today? - Fine. - Steak tartare. Want to try some? - Alex doesn't seem to have much of an appetite today. - Not like last night, eh? - I thought we could shoot some footage outside today. - Did you? Well I thought we could all have a nice little chat. Get to know you better. Though you and Marta seem to have a head start on me. So, how did you enjoy fucking my wife? Simple question, Alex. - Perhaps Alex is too much the gentleman. - Let the boy answer for himself, Marta. - I think you've got the wrong idea about me, really. I'm just here to do my job. - Ah yes, your job. Of course, I should have realized what a dedicated hack you are. I suppose last night's little episode comes under the heading of research, does it? A nice juicy little story to sell off to the tabloids? - That's not my style. - Is it not? Well. Then you're a very rare specimen indeed. A reporter with integrity? - I thought that was why you asked me here in the first place. - My wife invited you. She seems to believe in you. I myself have one or two reservations. Call me skeptical if you like, but I like to test a man's mettle before I put my faith in him. In fact, I have a marvelous idea. A little game. Let's see what you're made of. - What are you doing? - You filmed us, now I film you. - This game is called reaction. - What the hell do you think you're doing? - Fun, isn't it? Your turn? - You've gotta be fucking joking. - Come on Alex. Play the game. - This isn't funny, this is ridiculous! I get it. This is a wind up, right? Bang. - I might have guessed. No balls. - Alright then. - He is dead. You killed him, Alex! - What are we gonna do? - We? You shot him! - Game, set, and match. Or should I say hook, line, and sinker. Lost for words? That's not like you, Alex. A squib. A cinematic prop. - What the fuck is this? You knew, you knew all the time. - Yes. And you were perfect. - Perfect for what? - Call it an artistic experiment designed to capture that precise moment of shock and horror when one realizes one has taken another's life. It is something we very much wanted to pursue for the new show. It was wonderful. I cannot wait to see the footage. And the interview? - You didn't honestly think that we would allow ourselves to be interviewed by the likes of you, did you? A cheap little hustler going nowhere? Oh yes, we know all about you. The party's over, Alex. Piss off back to your dead end job and your junkie girlfriend. You know the way out. I assure you that you will very much regret that. - Jonathan. - Pack your bags and leave now. - She'll be back mate. You've just gotta give her time. - I'm not so sure. How could I be so fucking stupid? - You've just got to show her how much she means to you. Eh? Come on Alex. - Excuse me for interrupting your bonding session boys, but Mr. Steinman would like to see you in his office. Sorry Alex. And next time, leave it to the professionals. I really am sorry. - Well, if it isn't the station's new reporter. So new I didn't even know myself. Don't sit down. I had a phone call this morning from Jonathan Henley. Does that name ring a bell? - Ah. - You may well say ah. It appears you spent the weekend at his house posing as a reporter from this station. - I can explain-- - Let me finish. When you film to execute, whatever helpful scheme you had in mind you then proceeded to assault Mr. Henley in front of his wife! He was talking about suing the station! I had to talk very fast to get him off my back. So Alex. Entertain me. Convince me this is all a big mistake. - What he's saying is mostly bullshit. - Are you saying you didn't assault him then? - It wasn't like that, I-- - I don't really care what it was like! You are a total liability to the station and to yourself. You've got five minutes to clear your office-- - But-- - Then I want you out of here. And don't think you're just gonna waltz into another job in this business. You're on the shit list! - Filming me again, are you? Do you really think I'm gonna take this shit? How do you like this game? Or this one? Do your worst, see if I care. - The art! - Of course it can be covered by the insurance but-- - Insurance? There is more to this than glass and metal, you know. - We open as planned. Whatever the cost. - At least we got him on camera. I'll get this down to the police right away. - I don't think we need to involve the authorities. I'd rather deal with this personally. - Think I might have done something incredibly stupid. - You'd better come in. Well if I were you I'd get on the next plane to Rio. - Baz, this is fucking serious. - Big time! Let's just hope the Henleys don't decide to press charges. Look the most important thing now is to find Jo. - Yeah, I know, but it could be easier said than done. - Where do you think she might possibly be? - Dixon. - Yes! - Do your worst, see if I care. Do your worst. - I know what you care about, Alex. - Evening, Paul. Have you seen Jo? - She was here. And in a pretty sorry state, she'd been drinking. Do you know what that means? A year's work, down the drain. - Oh come on. - No you listen to me! Jo doesn't know if she's coming or going at the moment. And she doesn't need you screwing up her life anymore. - Where is she? - Not that it's any of your business but she's staying with me for the time being. - Oh yeah? You sure this is just a professional concern? - How dare you ask me that? You've messed Jo about. Don't make the mistake of imagining that you can do the same thing with me because you can't. If she wants to speak to you, and I emphasize if, she knows where to find you. Until then, stay away! - The overhand pull-- - Hello? - It's Alex. Don't hang up. - And tuck. And tuck. - We gotta talk. - Let me see it. - Jo, look. I know I've messed things up, but you've got to give me a chance to explain. - Paul said I shouldn't have any contact with you right now. It'll just make things worse. - This is between you and me. I can come over. Let's sort this out, please. - Alex, do you remember you promised you'd always look after me? You'd never do anything to hurt me? - And I meant it! - You lied! You bloody lied! I don't know you Alex, I really don't. - Jo. - Goodbye, Alex. - Jo. Back to the waist. Three, two, three, two. - Hello Jo. I think this is yours, isn't it? I was just passing by so I thought, well. May I come in? - Thank you but you needn't have bothered. - It's not the only reason I came. - Alex. - Your errant boyfriend, yes. I need to resolve a situation that's developed. The overhand pull and freeze. - My wife seems somewhat obsessed with him. - How nice for her. - Well. I can't afford to have that. We have our opening soon. Marta doesn't need any distractions. - Get to the point, Mr. Henley. - I need to know if you still have feelings for Alex. - Don't see how that's any of your business. And tuck, how we doing? - Do you still love him? - What do you want? In, out, in-- - You're not being very cooperative, are you? - Damn right I'm not! I think you should leave. That'll be Paul, he'll have you out of here faster than you can blink. Get off, get off! Three, two, three, four, five, six... - Come on Marta, get on with it. - Just hold her still. One, two, three, four-- It's forward and back. Forward and back. Forward and back. Double up. Push, good. Step into the side, right side curve. - There there, that's much better, yes. Now foot behind, ready to heel. The other hand pulls, back straight. Good. Kneel down and tuck. And tuck, let me see it. Good, hold it there. In, out. In... Good. - We don't have time for this. Come on. - Alex. You've got some bloody front. - Well I'm here now. Least you could ask if she'll see me. - Alright. But if she doesn't want to know you're out of here. Oh my god. - What happened? - Have a guess, Alex. - Stand clear. Fire. Charge again and increase. Ready. Stand clear. Fire. 360, charge again. - 360. - Stand clear. - Ready. - Fire. Okay, we have sinus rhythm. Good job everybody. Now let's get a tube in. - Alex. Alex, wake up. Make yourself scarce, come on. - What are you doing here? Haven't you done enough to my Jo already? - Mrs. Davis-- - You gotta leave. Come on. - Such a lovely girl. So full of life. - Thank you, Mr. Henley. It's very good of you to take the time. - Not at all. Now try not to worry. I have a feeling there'll be a change in her condition very soon. - Do you really think so? - I'm sure of it. Please keep me informed as to her progress. If there's any change, call me. Anytime, day or night. - What the hell are you doing here? - I heard the news about poor Josephine and just had to come and pay my respects. It's such a tragedy, the innocent are always the ones to suffer. - This is down to you. Jo wouldn't have done it by herself. It must have been you! How else could she have got this? When I take it to the police they'll-- - They'll what? Listen to you? And what exactly will you tell them? Picture's clear for all to see. A junkie takes the easy way out after some sordid domestic tiff, end of story. That proves nothing. You should have left well alone, Alex. And your little performance at the gallery doesn't do much for your credibility either. Does it? Goodbye, Alex. I don't think we'll meet again. - Oh that one's been broken. I'm sure that one won't matter, will it? Getting all self-conscious now Alex. - Somebody's breaking into the house. - What? Who is it? - It's your little friend, Alex. Bitch. Wait here. - Look at this! - Boy just doesn't know when to stop. - What are we going to do about him? - It's high time we put the little bastard out of the picture once and for all. - Screaming orgasm, please. - Right madam. - Have you had a rough day, love? - Excuse me? - Well if you don't mind me saying so, you look like you've been dragged through a hedge backwards. - Close. - Oh don't get me wrong. Rough and ready gets me every time. - Yeah? Maybe I'll go get meself cleaned up then. - I'll keep your stool warm for you, love. - I bet you will. - On our report from the world of the media. Jon and Marta Henley, the notorious video artists, join the unfortunate ranks of celebrities who have attracted the attentions of a stalker. In a Metro News 24 exclusive, we have security footage of the stalker causing severe damage to the Henleys' video installation last week. The man was apparently a model for their forthcoming show, Witness, and seems to have become completely obsessed by the Henleys. Events came to a head tonight when the man broke in to the Henleys' luxury country retreat, vandalized the house, and attacked Marta Henley who was fortunate to escape with bruising to the face. The man identified as Alex Watson, unemployed, is still at large, and police warn that he should be considered dangerous and should not be approached. Ironically, the Henleys have been strongly criticized for their provocative use of violent imagery. Sounds like a case of life imitating art. Wouldn't you say so, Doug? - Can you get me the police, quickly? - 6.50 please. - Aren't you going to have your drink? - Oh, oh yes, of course. - How is it, madam? - Lovely, thank you. Thank you. Call for you, Alex. - Hello? I'll call you back. Yeah? - Have you seen tonight's news? - What's up? - You're all over it. They're saying you've attacked the Henleys! - What? - You're in big trouble, mate. They've even shown some vid of you having a fit! Alex? Alex! - Alex, oi! Mate it's me! I've been looking for you everywhere! About the video. - Yeah I'm really sorry about that. - What do you mean sorry? It's great, I love it, the band loves it, even the record company loves it. - Just something I threw together. - Ah, you're so modest! It's brill, it's the dog's bollocks. I gotta say-- - Yeah yeah great, thanks Jake. - Whoa, Alex, hey hang on, look! They've approved your fee, I've got your check! Alex! I've... Editors. - God, you look like shit. - I don't like bacon, Baz. Any news on Jo? - No change mate, sorry. Looks like you finally made your mark. Well, are you gonna tell me what the hell is going on? This is serious, Alex! - You don't wanna believe everything you read in the papers. - Oh, so what am I supposed to believe then? I had the old blue 'round my place last night looking for you. And now you've got me creeping 'round like some bloody thief in the night! Just what the hell's going on? - I need your help, Baz. - You need my help? You need a bloody shrink. Look, I've bailed you out in the past Alex, no problem. But this is different. I know you're cut up about Jo but that's no reason to go off on whatever some kind of half-baked conspiracy theory! - Hang on. How long have you known me? Long enough to know when I'm not bullshitting. Right? So you gotta trust me when I tell you I've been stitched up. And what's more I can prove to you exactly what kind of people the Henleys are. - You can? How? - Get me into Metro. - What do we do now? - We go to work. - Welcome to Witness. It's opening night for the latest extravaganza from the freaky and fertile minds of Jon and Marta Henley. The Henleys are no strangers to the headlines this week as their stalker is still at large. - Morris Steinman. I'm afraid I've mislaid my ticket but I am on the guest list. - Sorry mate, according to this you're already inside. - What? - Five minutes. Great image. - Well well well. Alex. What a pleasant surprise. Look who's here, Marta. - Hello Alex. - Hello Marta. I knew you wouldn't mind me coming. After all I am the star of the show. - More like the skeleton at the feast. I do hope you're not going to turn violent again. It's been such an enjoyable evening so far. - In front of all these people? Bit heavy on the blusher, Marta. - Hurt your hand, Alex? - Actually, I'm here to play a little game. A specialty of yours I recall. I think we should fetch the police. - Stop fussing, Roland. Let's hear what the little shit has to say. It might be amusing. - I think it'll give everyone a really good laugh. This game is called Reaction. - Philip, the control room. - Hold it! Break the door down. - Come on Baz! - Come on, come on. - Come on! - I got him! Oh yes! - Yes, it's real. Look at this. Is this shocking enough for you? Do you like it? Let's all go to the Henley show, sip a little champagne, watch a little murder. I mean, it's art, isn't it? Anything goes. Think it's funny to you? I bet that poor bastard didn't. How would you like your neck broken because somebody thought you looked better dead than alive? 'Cause somebody thought it'd make a great image. You've all got blood on your hands. - Jon, what the hell is going on here? - I have no explanation. I can't believe what I've just seen. What is it, Marta? - Jonathan. - Ladies and gentlemen. I am as shocked and bewildered as you must be. I have never seen this footage before. I think you need to explain yourself. Marta. - Leave this to me. - Liar! Stay away from me! - Marta. - Don't come any closer! - Calm down, darling. Everything's going to be fine. - How could you? How could you? You betrayed me! You betrayed us! - It's alright. Everything's going to be alright. Trust me. Listen! Listen. Have you ever known me to lose control? - Control? Jon it's over! No don't Jon. Don't Jon. No! - Alex. You really are determined to ruin my evening aren't you? Full marks for initiative. I think we should discuss this somewhere more comfortable. - You're going to offer me an obscene amount of money for this tape. - I am a very wealthy man. Think about it. I could change your life. - You already have. Fuck you. - Give me the camera. - No! - Come on Alex. Your girlfriend put up a better fight. Jonathan! Jonathan! - Marta! Another little game you don't know how to play, Alex. Put it down.
