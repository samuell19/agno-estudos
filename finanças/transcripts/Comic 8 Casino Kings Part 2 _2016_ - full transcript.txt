My name's Cynthia. I work for National Central Bureau Asian South Pacific. I'm stationed here to investigate all the suspicious activity regarding Bank INI robbery case. Before you're put in jail. You understand me or not? These are the photos from the crime scene. These are your photos, right? Look at me, I'm handsome. I have a sharp nose. He doesn't. Look. She baptizes my phone. Is this you? Who is this guy? That can't be me. Look again. His eyes are slanted. Whose photo is this? Where were you when the robbery occurred? Where do you want me to be? As manager and attorney, I object to the reason for my client's arrest. Because when the bank was robbed, they were somewhere else. This guy has information about The King. Tell us where The King's headquarters is. At the 32 kilometers mark, until a gas station, and make a U-turn after that. Second intersection, a house with a black fence. It's at the road's end, across a garage. He put his name on a sign? Hey, kids! Sonya eats some fried banana. Papak eats the catfish. If we may, we want to ask something. If not, it's okay. What do you guys want? Hey, we're the real kings. Show them! Damn you! I'll arrange it so you can join the tour. And in the meantime, I'll have Ge Pamungkas accompany you. - What is this? - It's a map. - Casino! - Jackpot! - What should we do? - Hand over the map! Thank you. I invited you here to offer you a job. I'll pay you ten times your usual fee... to do stand-up comedy in a casino on a private island. What took you so long? Who are you? He's Isa. I'm Bella. Isa... Bella? The love tale of two worlds? Separated because of different traditions? How does he know? - Nikita? - Just chill, boss. Have fun. My recommendation worked, didn't it? Business is good? Fantastic. I suggest you to divide them into three groups. I've put the program in their brain. I only need to activate it. Are you Chris John? Do you still love to hit people? - What are we going to throw then? - The cheaper meat, not this one. - A cheaper one? - Yes. Here you go. Why won't they attack me? That's how much you hate me? Am I not at all tempting? I'm a snake demon. We're reptiles. Stupid crocodile! You're electrocuted now! There's electricity? I can charge my phone then. They're afraid of moving things. They'll feel threatened. Don't they detach their tail when they're threatened? How stupid you are. That's a gecko. "A human breathes with its lungs, a fish breathes with..." Its gills. Water? Oxygen? Lungs? Water, oxygen? What's the answer? It's easy. God's permission. CORRECT! It's a good thing I love to watch Meteor Garden. The tail is detached, just like a gecko. Am I crazy or is the crocodile an idiot? Alarm clock? I can't confirm that, Officer. I'm not sure if those guys are the same person as these bank robbers. Especially since it happened a long time ago. And they're wearing masks. That's right. But they shot all the CCTV and they opened their masks. That's what the hostages said when I interviewed them. So can they identify that those pictures are the guys from the robbery? I told you, a lot of the photos have scratches and are unclear. Yeah, but that's what really happened. Okay. So you agree that the hostages are forced to look down? - Meaning? - You don't understand me? But you didn't. When the hostages were freed, remember? - Hey! - Sir. - On duty, sir? - Yes, I am. Same here, I'm on duty. Nice! Permission to resume duty? You are not the bank's customer. So where were you? Here's the thing... At that time... Okay. Peace be upon you! Upon you, too. Come in. Come. - Excuse me, Mr. Indro. - Yes. - I'm Ence. The new security guard. - Okay. Afternoon, Mrs. Indro. She's not my wife. She is Ms. Cynthia, a police officer. - Just like me. - Why is she like that? Yeah, we're both maintaining security. Oh, yeah... Excuse me. My coat. Yeah, sorry. Where's your station? At what division? Interpol. A policewoman? - No, Interpol. - I know that, Mr. Indro. Internal, right? I'm otherwise in an external division, patrolling the area. I almost joined the force, too. But I fell asleep during the test. But I still got accepted. As a sleeping officer or speed bump. Of course I rejected it. I don't want to lie down all day and get run over by cars. I could get some chicken poop on my face from some nasty tires. My face would be full of it. It's not funny at all. I'm here to give you this invitation. They're cutting one of our neighbors' son. Just the tip, you know? - Circumcision. - You know what I mean. Get down! Is that thing loaded? Can't shoot the chopper down without any bullets. Watch out! Smoke grenade! Hands up! Grab that gun! Stop kicking it and grab it! Hurry or I'll shoot you. Grab it! - It slipped from my hands. - Hurry! Oh, my gosh. See? It slipped. Ouch! - Oh my... - Where is it? Hey, use the door! How do you open this? Come on! Come on, grab it! Help me lift the couch, Mr. Indro. Go to sleep! Shit, I can't get in. I told you to lift the couch. Why are lifting me... I really don't like this place. I think we're too late. Baby, it's too late Baby, it's too... Whatever. The shot must have come from here. It's all messed up. But there's one thing that caught my suspicion. The TV is intact! This guitar, too. And there's a black coat in here. From what I'm seeing, I think the shooter is a musician who also sells TVs. They didn't even drink the tea! He might be... What? Call the cops! Where do you think this is? This is Indonesia, we don't have 911. Wow, you're so sensitive, aren't you? Excuse me. You summoned me, Your Highness? I don't know if this is the right time. But... I want to give you a proposal. Proposal? We're not doing a high school festival, right? Or you mean a wedding proposal? I think I would be crazy to refuse that offer. I've gone through a lot of changes. My face. My body... That's already perfect. You don't need to change it anymore. - Is it hot in here? - Kind of. Come here, let me open your shirt. Babe, what is that? I have changed everything. But I'm saving this one for you. Especially for you. Someone turned on the AC, it's getting cold now. I'm keeping this to make you remember what I was like. When I'm still happy at your arms. - In my arms? - Yes, at Cinta Waras Mental Hospital. I wrote you hundreds of love letters. And I know somewhere inside you feel the same as I feel. Get this man away from me! Just dump him anywhere! You damn dog! Since then, I've had a grudge on mentally ill people. And I start my brainwashing practice, and patient trafficking. I want to give you proposal. Is it hot in here? Let me open your shirt. Excuse me. The Crocodile's Den is breached. Eight comics died. Eight remain. - They're entering the jungle. - Okay. Right away, Your Highness. The Hunters Squad. They are your creation, too, right? Good afternoon. Congratulations. You have passed the first level. On this next level you will be facing the number one killer squad in a third of the world. They are battle-hardened and in operation for the last 30 years. Of course, you can pick any weapons you like. This is a game of survival. The choices are either you kill or be killed. And for the killer squad... have fun. There they are! - What was that? - A dragonfly? - Get them! - Go! Oh, no! King! Forgive me, King. Please, forgive me. I've talked to them, as you ordered. - Who is this? - A janitor. Where are we going? Is the legendary comedian here? Yes, Your Highness. With two extra men from Dr. Pandji's assistant. Put them in, too. Yes, Your Highness. What's wrong with you? No, mind your own business. You jerk! You're nosy. Stop! I need a break. A break? You want to die? You haven't done your pilgrimage. I need to take a leak. I don't want to get a bladder stone. Hey, I can use it to make a ring. - Shut it, or I'll cut you for meat. - Enough of that. Go. Fine. But really, gemstones are pricey these days. Whatever. Ernest, those guys are using heavy weaponry. What do we have? We still have a gun. An empty one. But don't worry. We also have 30 more minutes to live. Last time it was a pop-quiz, now it's a food stall? Excuse me? Anyone there? Have you got any ammo? I have a shooting guitar, but no ammo for it. - Excuse me? - What are you doing? People said if you can't find a cassava, the root will do. Are you insane? You think that root will taste good? - Yuck. - Not very smart, are you? Making a bonfire in the middle of a hunting game. Are they the Killer Squad that was mentioned earlier? Don't be so quick to judge. Maybe they're lost, too. They were on bus number 75, looking for a way home. Could be. Go ahead and ask them. - Where are they? - Looking for someone? Oh, shit! - I'm George. - Hi, George. And you? You must be Rudy. Then you guys are George Rudy. You guys are really a pain. Ready to die? We're here to finish you off. They really are the Killer Squad. You trust me now? You're the one who wouldn't believe me. Hold it! You want to shoot an armless man? That's a gun. - Put it down! - Where is it? Where? I don't see it. Where? I don't see it. Listen. How about a hand-to-hand combat? Hand-to-hand! - It's fair. - So it's fair. Drop that and face me if you dare. - Indro! - Hurry! Go up! Hey, come here and fight, mullet. - Beat him. - Come here! - Fight him. - Why me? And you? What happened to your hair, some satay sauce got into it? What's with those contact lens? Come! Come here, you will be facing... Where is Bintang? You, fight me. Get him, man! Teach him a lesson! Come on, let's get him, Ri. Fight him yourself. Look at him, that guy is just an old man. Do we have to hurt him? Use your brain. So we'll let him beat us to death? Better than being impolite. I can't hurt an old man. What are they gonna do to us? They're gonna kill us! Bastards! I have a plan. - Goddamn kid! - Do me a favor. - I need your help. - What plan? I will plant a bomb. - A bomb? Are you serious? - Of course I am. Charlie Chaplin! Miss Policewoman, I'm scared. - Buy me some time. - Buy you what? - You, distract them. - Huh? Smack them? - Distract, distract! - Dis what? It's... What did you say? Buy us some time. What should I do? You're a security guy, you face them. But... You're not just an ordinary guard. You're a security guard. Look at your uniform. "Security." You are messing with authority. How long should I distract them? - Five minutes. - Can you make it in two? Four and a half, no more bargaining. It's a fixed price. Come on! Come here! I think you're afraid. May I take your order? Want me to take your eyeballs out? Or you want me to cut your manhood? What... No! Oh, my God! Hold it! Wait a minute. Do we have a time limit? That's up to you! What if we fight until I take your life right from your throat? Fine, let's do it. Wait, one more thing! How will I know when that happens? I wouldn't be able to speak, use some signal... - That doesn't hurt at all. - Fight him back. - Really? - No, it's doesn't. Wait, let me try. Okay, let's fight. Fight me! - Why does it hurt so much? - No, it doesn't. - What were you saying? - Nothing. You hair stinks! Every signal and frequency is blocked off from this island. It's almost like we've vanished. We can't be detected in this place. Wait. How did you know all this? Who are you, really? I can't tell you. But we are on the same side. We're aiming for world peace. You know Comic 8? They work for me. Take it easy, Ernest! We have to look for the transmitter tower and we have to destroy it! Stop! It hurts! - Where does it hurt? - In here. Shit, I missed it! Hey, stay where you are! Stay still. Wait. Damn it! But first, we have to get out of here. Give me a minute, madam. Who are you calling "madam"? Who else but the Madam Sexy, Exotic, and Erotic herself? You're old, but you can light up my youth. Fight back, it doesn't hurt. No more. Hey! Help me! I'm dying! No. I don't want to die in sin. Are you okay, pops? Why do you eat that? - That's so gross. - What? I mean stick that thing in here. He's going to die. Officer, what are you doing? Focus, you hear me? My bad. Wait. Mongol! My God. Are you okay? - Are you okay? - Yeah, what are you wearing? Oh, my God. Why did I do that? Fight back. It doesn't hurt. It hurts so much! What is Ernest doing, Ri? I don't know. He's fighting an old man. Oh, my God. This is not right. He's not a good kid. You see? Uncle, look for that signal-jamming tower. Mr. Security, you go with Indro. Stop fighting already. Just play along. Pops, just relax, okay? You're not supposed to hurt an old man. Are we done playing games? Give me everything you got. Let me see it. Watch my ultimate move! Bye, old man! He's running away. What a pain. Stop it, madam! Come on. Careful! - Get down! - No! It hurts! Liar. Your friend told me otherwise. Who's lying? How come your friend can't hurt us, but you can? Using some black magic? Want to try again? Come down. I'm scared. - Tired yet? - You think? - Thirsty? - You have some drink? Wait a second. Be, get him some drink. Mr. Willy is thirsty. Are you crazy? Where can I get some water? You want me to squeeze it out of these leaves? Sorry, but we don't have any. - Shall we continue? - Shall we? My body hurts all over. My armpit has cramps. We've been scouring this place for two days, but still nothing. How come it's so inaccurate? I can see an island over there, but not on the map. I can't believe this. Maybe they have some kind of an advanced frequency jammer? And the tools we have here is too old school. - You mean old school is bad? - It is. Don't you dare tell me old school is uncool. Let me tell you, you don't need those things to search for this. Then what should we use? Soul should come before everything. - What are you looking at? - Whatever you say. Excuse me. I just want to pee. Bitter bean with fried sambal, Arabian taste. With a hint of dates. Go easy on him, pops. Oh my, Ernest. Ernest, don't be too hard on him! They are chasing each other. Surely going straight to hell. You think you're the only killer here? Time for me to shine! Chew on this! - What is this? - Maybe we can eat it? Oh, my mom! What is it? We have to look for a higher ground. Because a transmitter is usually placed in high places. Like that one? That's right! You really are a good guard. Security, sir. Yeah, "securicit." Come on. Sir, I'm afraid to go inside. There's a lot of skeletons in here. Relax, they are just some scarecrows. They're to chase away birds, not us. It's not a scarecrow, it's a skeleton! I can't do it. I'd rather fight a transvestite than have to climb like this. I'll do it here. But this is just the first floor. I know the transmitter is up there. We can just blow it up from down here. How can we know from here? You see those wires? Just some electrical wires. That transmitter is running on electricity. So does my TV at home. TV is a receiver. Receiver and transmitter operates using electricity. - What if... - Stop, you're getting on my nerves. Shut up, you guardsman I'm a security guard. You want me to call you a night watch? Please don't. Now you listen. I'm planting three at the same time. You're mad, Ndro. Shut the door! No, wait! I can feel something. Are you enjoying it? Does it fit? Yes. Move it! She was the one controlling us. Yeah, she got us brainwashed. - Let's get her! - Let's go! So this is what they call you fall and nothing hits you. It hurts. This must be Dr. Pandji's doing. Willy? What are we doing in here, Rudy? Are we on a movie set? - A set? - We're not on a movie set! We're in The King's empire. I think they brainwashed us. Can they stop brainwashing us already? Yeah, I'm feeling dizzy. I think I'm on a movie set. Who are you? Where am I? Mr. Barry Prima? Mr. Barry! - You know me? - Of course! Your movies are playing all day at my house. - It's Mr. Barry! - Who is he? - He doesn't know! - He doesn't know! - You're tacky! - Are you my fan? My head hurts so much, Ge. "Ge"? You remember me now? - Did you just call me Ge? - Yes. Don't kiss me, I'm straight. Where are we? Why am I wearing this? - What's going on with me? - Wait, look at her. - Where is this? - Follow me. Okay, but slow down. My head hurts. Listen, so we're actually agents. Chinese medicine agents. - I never used a Chinese drug. - I know. But all those weapons are real. So you can leave them and just go. I've handled these kind of things all the time. It's empty. - Take it with you. - Okay. Where should I go? There's a hangar and a plane south of this island. - South? - South is over there, sir. All right, see you. Wanna grab a bite? Maybe later. I'm just praying for your safety. I don't need prayer, I need cash. - Fine, take care then. - I'm a bit low right now. Good luck, Mr. Barry, I hope you stay Prima! - Mr. Barry! - Who is he? Grab the gun. I should've asked for a photo. I remember I was called in for an audition by a shady production house. And when I sat alone, I heard a violin. And everything went blank. - I understand. - What? About that violin, I've smashed it. An explosion on island's west side. We should head there. Okay, how about Mr. George and Willy? Are you coming with us? George Rudy? Wily? What are they doing here? I bet these guys also got brainwashed. Come with me, there's a hangar there. Leave this place. This is a war zone. It's dangerous. - Come on. - We can take care of it from here. - Yes, we get the gun. - It's the big one for me. - What are you doing? - You didn't know? This is a call for Mongol. Whenever he hears this, his body will move and then he'll come here right away. That's the response! That is Babe's voice! - I have to go there. - Okay. Okay. Sorry, madam. We have to go somewhere but... This is dangerous. Let me... - What is this? - Yeah, this is dangerous. - Here, take it. - Okay. Call the police and ask for backup. Tell them they kidnapped an Interpol officer. No, thanks. My shoes are still good. You idiot! Look! There's a phone in here? Hello, this is Bareskrim. Officer, I want to report to Interpol. Not the Interpol. The Crime Investigation Agency. - You've got the wrong number. - Hello? He hung up. - Hello? - There's an Interpol agent named Cynthia. No one here by that name. There's an Interpol agent named Cynthia here. You've got the wrong number. There's no Cynthia here. - Who? This is not the Interpol. - Excuse me, sir? - Why? - They're probably looking for Cynthia. - Who's she? - Mr. Joe's guest. I will hand you the phone if you use proper Indonesian. This is Indonesia, speak Indonesian. - Okay, sir. - "Okay" is not Indonesian. Why did you hang up the phone, sir? - He will call again. - Just ask them to trace the call. - Hello? - Hello, Officer? Can we ask for a tracking dog? Ask them to trace the call back for its coordination. Can you trace the coordinates of this call? Look for the dock and wait for backup there. Yes, Dan! My name is not Hamdan. I'll be waiting for my guys. Go! Yes, Ndro! Bastard! Look, that's the island! That's the island! See, my gut was right! The island is there! You never said that! You said the island is not here. You told me just now! Who said that? You can see the island yourself. I told you the clue was right. The island is here. It's proven now. Shut up! We're going to land! It's all Dr. Pandji's doing. We're all part of his experiment. Yeah, he made us into a gambling chip. - How did it happen? - It's a really long story. So what should we do now? Should we go strike the casino? Let's go there now. You guys enter by the front gate. Create a distraction. Give me some time to look for another entry point. And then you go in and grab The King. - Do it now! - Yes, sir! Be! Come on! Fine. Hey! Enough! - What? - Let's go. Don't move! Get on the ground! Don't move or get on the ground? Everyone get on the ground and stay still! What if we tell them to get out? Yeah, that's a good idea. We don't want them to get shot. So I should correct my order? Like writing a thesis. All right, sorry, everyone. Let's fix the order. If you are a good citizen, please leave this place. Get out! - This way. - Just mind your own business. Let's spread out, guys. - Search The King and Dr. Pandji. - Go! King? I think I better go now. Pandji, if you leave now, you will regret it. You'll be curious, won't be able to sleep. Now I can laugh again! If something happens I've planted bombs all over this island. Okay? I just need to push this. Your Highness, I think you're the one who should relax. You can control other people as you wish. But you are under control! Genius! What? No, it's not revenge. Do I look like a person who holds a grudge? Enough, bring all the gold. We'll go to the Maldives. Don't forget to buy a teddy bear on the way. Hey! Don't move! Just go and prepare the plane! Watch out! I'm gonna finish these stupid comics! Come here, cowards! I'm just going to put the gun down. To make it more intense. - This is bad. She broke everything. - It's broken! She said broken, too? Ouch! It hurts! Ouch! Hey, stop staring! Help me! I'm going to have a baby! What should we do? Well, let's help her. Okay, we will help you. But don't shoot at us, okay? I won't shoot you. It hurts! We don't even know who the father is. It hurts! Ko, get me some towels and hot water. Come on. One, two, three. Slowly! Put her on the table. - Take a deep breath and relax. - Can you do it? - I've learned about this. - From where? From YouTube. Now, shut up. You're dead! What are you doing? You took so long. You shot him? I was about to smack this guy. You took too long. Let's go and find that crazy doctor. - You're wasting our time. - You'd be dead if you were still awake. Mongol, take him out. Okay! Watch out! Are you crazy? Warn me if you want to shoot! You could have killed me! We have to stay alive. Use your brain, not this. Use your brain. - He... - What? He... Why didn't you tell me earlier? - Get him! - Face me, you sissy. He said we're sissies. - You... - You smashed my violin. And you changed my clothes, including my underwear. What did you see? Did you like it? You liked it? Don't be mad because yours is small. Relax, you're not alone. - Don't worry. - Mongol! Water, a basin, and a towel. Wait, I know what to do about childbirth. I used to have a pet mouse. It's so easy to help the birth. Just push their belly. - And the baby came out? - It came out. But the mother died. Talk again and I'll slap your mouth. It hurts. It's my turn. Stand back. I can take him. How about we fight like a man? I'm not afraid of you. Put that down! As you wish. What were you saying? Open that mouthpiece. Strike me first. Hey, who pulled your teeth? Put that back on. Put that back on! Who's afraid now? Mongol, get down! Let's go! Finally, we did it. Good thing I watch YouTube. Is it a boy or a girl? I think it's "to be confirmed." Isa! Isa. Isa. Isa. Please don't leave me. I can't live without you. We were never meant to be. No. I won't believe that. You are my life and my death. Goodbye, my love. Goodbye, my friend. You're still the one. You're still the one... No! I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry. Isa! Isa! Sa! We will always be together, in this life. They died together. Where should we bury them? Don't be sad. Stop crying. I can't cry, I have the face of a thug. Take good care of the baby, okay? I can't take it anymore... Wait! You can't just leave the baby. What should we do? She's dead? I think so. I told you not to press the belly. Fight like a man. Now, this will be fun. Last time was half-assed. This is the real fun. We're wasting time. Come on, don't be lazy. - A little workout is good for you. - Okay. Now you're wasting time. Come on, fight. Can we go now? What? Hey, these guys are mine! We can go through here, Be. It's open. - That's Dr. Pandji. - Where? Let me shoot his brains out. That's too much violence. Hold this for me. We will use this. It's heavy! You sure that won't hurt them? Just tickles. - Hey, Dr. Pandji! - Hey! Don't move! Stay where you are! Sorry, Agung! Oh, my God! He got away! Pandji! Hey! What happened to you guys? Did we get Dr. Pandji? Hey, where are you going? - That's Dr. Pandji! - Get him! Hey! Hey! Where are you going? So you're the one behind this? Yes, I am the guy. I am the mastermind behind all of this. Surprised? You better back off or I'll blow up this island! Back off! Back off! Is that a vibrator? It's a detonator. But the shape is kind of... Hey! This whole island is rigged with bombs. One push of this button, and you're all dead. Slow down! Relax. You're the one who put me in prison. I was suffering! All day, all night. I had to listen to you performing stand-up on TV. Do you know why? Because that's the only entertainment that prison guards had. And I can't take it anymore. Every time I hear their laughs, I felt like crying! Because that reminded me of everything you have done to me. Shut it down! Hey! That's not even funny! Turn it off! Hey, guards! Back to work! Stop watching TV! It hurts, you know? You are dragging. So what do you want? You're just one person. We are many. What will you do now? You want to shoot me? Or my friends? If you shoot, I'll push this and kill all of you. You understand that? Guys, I just had a vision. Doc... I think you won this time. We admit we lost. So if you want to go, just go. We'll be on our way, too. - What are you doing? - Just trust me, guys! - This guy is right. - Come on. See? Listen to him! Now you know who's the boss? I am the winner! Me! That's a giant crocodile! Come on! Go, go! How come that thing turned into a dragon? By metamorphosing? Hey! - The Interpol lady? - You again? Hi. Beautiful girl. Calm down, we can explain everything. No, no. No need. I know who you are, and so does Mr. Indro. You work for him, huh? I don't have problem with you guys. Reunion of this country's slaves. Okay, okay. Okay. I have one last thing... for you. Agree? What? Looking for a bomb detonator? Hey! Let me tell you something. Your detonator is gone. A crocodile swallowed it, along with Dr. Pandji. Yes. No! Sir! Who found this place? Not Christopher Columbus? So, when... - This place found us. - "This place found us"? - What did she say? - Where is Boss Indro and our backup? I got a bad feeling about this. Who are those guys? - They are... - Comics. You know? Comics? But I don't see them with a drawing or a pencil. Comics. You know, the... - A joker. I remember that. - Yes. - But they're innocent. - What? They're innocent? They're clearly guilty. Innocent. They just happened to be there. - Listen. Wait. - I was... Innocent. They happened to be there. I can explain. I don't have to! I was with them. - Shut up! - I can explain it to you! How about if we spread out and search for Boss Indro. - That's a good idea. Let's go. - Okay. They are criminals. Get them! - Go get them now, hurry! - What? No! - Cynthia, listen. - Don't move! Get on the ground, now! Make way! In the name of the law, you are under arrest! We finally got you, bank robbers! I've been looking for you all over the world! Don't play games with me. I'm the Chief Commissioner. Joe Tarli. Bring them in! We're being set up. Who set us up? Boss Indro? He told us not to think with common logic. Nothing is impossible. Hello, is everybody here? For my dearest agents. First, I have to apologize to you. I'm sorry that this had to happen. I have a bad news and good news. The good news is you have succeeded in this mission. And like always, good job, guys. The bad news is, actually I was... How should I say this? I was using you guys. This Golden Skull has been my real goal for a long time. According to folklore, this is a first evidence of civilization before mankind. And whoever has it, will be the one true king of the world. The bones were built from pure gold. The source of the purest gold ever to be found. It's priceless. Especially for those who know how to use it. Last intel I had is that this object is in a hands of a criminal. A criminal named The King. Enjoy your life in prison. Enjoy whatever is left in your life. Adiós! So you're all secret agents? And Mr. Indro, I tell you, he has never existed. Hoax. The intelligence agency you spoke about never existed. Of course it won't. We are black ops. Everything is off the books. I already look into all those. None of them exists. He's also an international prime target, you know? This case has been leaking. Crime is everywhere. Inside intelligence agency. There's a fake syndicate posing as intelligence. And we'll keep on looking. We're so blind. We're just too stupid. He really got us. We've been following him for eight years. Okay. Listen, I will help you guys as much as I can. But I'm sorry, you guys will have to stay here for a long time. Guys. You know, I have a skill. I can mimic animals voices. Here's the sound of a crocodile. I'm an Eastern man. And I have some stories to tell. Because I feel Easterners like me are subject to discrimination. Especially in jobs. Somehow, my people are never really accepted in any type of job. I guess there's only one job that us Easterners can do. A security guy. Right? Dating in Indonesia is like a soccer game. Only two sides fighting, with millions of onlookers. Right? When someone stops them, the spectators shout, "Stupid referee!" This is an ongoing debate. A woman gave birth and called her husband. "Honey, we have a baby. He has your eyes." And he replied, "Oh, I see." "Maybe we should talk later, "I don't want your husband to hear us." Boarding house rent is widely varied in Jakarta. Starting from 300 thousand to 3 million rupiahs. I bet you can guess where am I staying, right? At the 300-thousand place, of course. So I can save. The 3-million place is for privileged kids. With full facilities. Complete with TV, AC, and a bathroom inside. The 300-thousand place also has a bathroom inside. But you sleep outside. Enjoy your life in prison. Enjoy whatever is left of your life. Adiós! Like you said. This skull is priceless. It's worth everything. - Am I right? - Yes, no. Is it yes or no? I mean yes! You're still expecting a salary these days? Think. Who is this? Who are you bringing here with us? He said he's an agent. Do you know who am I? Cak Lontong, right? Are you sure he's a secret agent? How can you not know? I am Cak Lemper. Cak Lontong's cousin. I had a feeling about that! But that is not entirely true. The fact is that I am... Cak Lontong! Cool. I can do a rabbit voice, too. Here's how it sounds. That's a rabbit hiccupping. Sir, excuse me. I used to work as a security guy. It's the first time I worked as a caterer. What do I do? Okay, listen. As catering staff, you have to watch. This is the lunchbox, snacks and drinks. Watch them and make sure nothing is missing. What's the difference to a security job? If I change the question, "Anyone here not liking a girl soccer player?" I bet there's a lot of you, especially the guys. Me too. I kind of hate seeing a girl playing soccer. I can't watch them for long, they keep running and playing soccer. They're wearing tight outfits, and they're bouncing. My neighbor just open a restaurant called "Love Me." Sounds good. I went to eat there, and the food is good. And then I called the waitress, "Mila!" Her name is Mila, by the way. "How much is this, Mil?" And then she counts everything and, "It's so expensive." I went to her. "Hey, why is this so expensive? I thought the name was "Love Me." Don't you "love me" anymore?
