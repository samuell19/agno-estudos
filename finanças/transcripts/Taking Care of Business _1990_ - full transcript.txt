There are 2 spelling errors, the columns are off, And the staple is vertical, not horizontal. Ahh... Spencer barnes? Diane connors. I've heard good things. All right! I like your strategy, barnes. Beating the owner of the company in tennis. Smart way to get attention. Oh, i wasn't trying to get attention. I was just... trying to win. Exactly. We're all trying to win. Listen. When i heard you beat sakamoto, I knew i was gonna like you. Here we are, sir. Mr. Sakamoto! Oh, good evening, miss connors. Hey, big sak! What's up, man? I've never had such a competitive opponent. You play an unusual game of tennis. Unusual, but effective. Well, hey, you're not so bad yourself, you know. You got to choke up on that racket. Let's get down to business, shall we? Now, bentley is in first place To take over our national ad campaign. Now, here's the deal, spencer. Friday's close was at 56, One of the most active stocks traded. Smoke? Oh, i don't smoke, But a couple of my friends do. Do you mind if i take some? You mind? Thank you. My point is this. As well as we're doing, we want to do better. The bottom line, after all, is money. I'd like to propose a toast. To international business, To good commercial relations between all countries, To the healthy future of high quality foods Thanks to sakamoto enterprises, And to bentley advertising. Hear, hear. Yeah. A toast... To competitiveness, Good management, profit, and honesty. Yeah. Spencer. A toast. Spencer. Toast. Sure. Uh, a toast. To the cubs winning the world series... And big tits! Spencer, i'm sure you're familiar With our last campaign. Um, yes. Um... ♪ high quality foods, the best there is ♪ Oh, yeah. I watch tv all the time. I got the commercials memorized. We've been using that for years. We are looking for a new image, And we love what bentley did for kerry's cookies. Honesty is the key to success. I want an honest campaign, spencer. Honesty, huh? That's good. Are you familiar With high quality's products? Oh, yeah. I eat the stuff every day. And what is your opinion? Honestly? Well, i think your oatmeal sucks. Nobody likes it. I mean, it tastes like dirt. Chewy dirt. And your bologna tastes like rubber. You gotta smother it with mustard So you don't even taste it. But not your mustard, 'Cause your mustard tastes like shit. Um, your frosted flakes... It's got half the sugar That tony the tiger's does. And your bread just rips apart. I mean, just try Spreading peanut butter on it. Whaah... Right in your hands. But not your peanut butter, 'Cause your peanut butter sucks. Spencer, i don't think this is really... Why did he ask me, then? Ms. Connors, what do you think About what he is saying? I think it's outrageous. Mr. Barnes, if this is your idea of a joke, I don't find it very funny. No! No, i'm just being honest. Well, you've been honest enough. No, no, please, spencer. Go on. Tell me, mr. Barnes, is there anything About high quality foods that you like? Oh, your potato chips are pretty good. But, then again, i like really greasy food. And, uh... It's not so bad that you sell cheap stuff. I mean, not everybody can afford 3 bucks for a box of fruit loops. But you shouldn't call it "high quality foods" 'Cause it just isn't. I mean, big sak, if you want to be honest, You should call it "low quality foods." But you don't want to do that, i know. Why don't you try calling it Something like, um... How 'bout "affordable foods"? Or, you know what? Change the "best there is" thing To "high quality food... Because you can afford it." Or make your food really great, And then you can say, "Eat this because everybody deserves High quality foods." How dare you insult our product. Mr. Sakamoto, i am so sorry... No, no, no. This is ridiculous. I've never seen anything So unprofessional. Well, you know what, maybe i just, uh... I'm just not good at these kind of meetings. All right? I gotta hot date. I'm outta here. Nice tits. Heh heh. I am out of here also. Nice titty. We go. I've got the nurses' station. Get me walter bentley on the phone. Now. Mmm. Bmw... Mercedes... Jaguar. Hey, chico. Take care of her. Yeah. I'll take care of her. I haven't robbed anyone. I've been robbed! Look at me! Do you think i dress this way? I'm an executive! 383. I'd sue for false arrest, But i'd probably end up In the electric chair. One comb. Listen, i need a ride. One pair of shoelaces. Hello? Earth to little abner. I need a ride. We're not a taxi service. One piece of paper. Oh, god. God, debbie, i'm so sorry. I'm really so sorry. Oh, don't be silly. It was good to hear your voice again. I gotta cancel my credit cards. I gotta call high quality foods. I gotta call elizabeth. I just need to go back to walter's in malibu. So if you'd just please take me there. First i'm making us dinner. Oh, debbie, debbie, no. I have to get back there right now. Spencer! Spencer, i am not moving until you say yes. Yes! Ye-Yes! Yes. Yes. So then, mitch tells me that he's married. Whoa. Uh! He obviously was not the man for me. No way. No, i mean he thought he could control me. I felt like... Like i was in prison. Oh. Man, i know that feeling. Yeah? Oh, yeah. Trapped, lonely, and frustrated. You know, you're stuck inside. You don't know how you got there, But you're there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, i was in a relationship Like that recently. Really? Yeah. It lasted about 3 years. Oh. Controlled by one person Who could be so cruel. Exactly! Yeah. You know, all you want to do is, Experience the things that you can't reach. You know, like a baseball game Or a... Or a dinner with a pretty girl. Oh. Well, i'm... I'm shy. You wouldn't know it. Somehow i... I feel free. I feel open. I feel sexy. Check! Uh, check, please.
