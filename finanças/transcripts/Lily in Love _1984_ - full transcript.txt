[music playing] [laughter] The trouble with you is you'vefallen in love with yourself. And I made a remarkable choice. I will never get left on the shelf, and I'll never get tired of my voice. [applause] AUDIENCE MEMBER: Bravo. Bravo. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Bravo. Oh, you've got to put it away. You're kidding. This is his golden moment. Give me that spotagain, and keep it on him. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Bravo. Bravo. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Bravo. Thank you, thank you, thank you. My god, you were wonderful tonight. It was like playing before kings. He's not. Oh, he's not, a curtain speech. Sad to say, this is our very last performance. So I would like to throw one final bouquet. As you know, Shakespeare,Marlowe, Dryden Johnson-- Oh, my lord. --have all been such a great part of my life. They're my real cronies. But I've only had twomarvelous contemporary roles in the theater, and both writtenby the same brilliant author. Oh, my god. It's not every actor, ladies and gentlemen-- I don't believe this. --who is fortunate enough tohave a house writer for a pet. It is great pride therefore which compels me to introduce the author of tonight's play, my wife, Lilly. [applause] [inaudible],, don't you dare, Fitz, please. I will not do it. I can't. Bravo. Bravo. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Bravo. Bravo. [piano music] There was this crowd of people calling me sugar. So I turned around, and therewas this young reporter. I know just what you need, honest. Well, of course you do. You're Pitche's agent. I just can't thank you enoughfor your family's support. We of the theater, without your help, would be just helplesscitizens plodding the streets. Darling, this isJennifer, the understudy. She was so good in Baltimore, you remember. The banker's wife is over there. Would you like some pate? Oh, dear, no, don't give him that. Why? It's goose liver, darling. You'll regret it. Because I detest goose. So now that the show is over, what's next? The usual oblivion, perhaps another film, if that genius over thereever finishes the script. You're so inventive, youdon't need a writer anymore. Listen, can I stay with you tonight? Sure, why? Well, because tonight, I just don't feel like being the personsitting at home waiting. Come on, let's go. Have you seen Lilly, Ben? She left ages ago. Lucky Lilly. Mr. Wynn. Who called? I just want to tell youhow much I admire your work. I'm an actor too. You have my deepest sympathies, my son. I've got my firstShakespeare gig this summer. I don't want to hear about it. I was wondering if youcould give me some advice. Why not? Let us retire from this unspeakable gloom and discuss it over a bottle. I'm beginning to clash. Harry the King. - Bedford. - Bedford. - Exetor. - Exetor. - Warwick. - Warwick. Harvard. And all the rest be intheir flowing cups with-- [coughing] Let the young hacks today wallow in a monosyllabic miasma. The Tudor poets, by God, they have balls. They knew how to make our language fly. Marlow's my man. No, fear the triple region of the air, and let the majesty of heaven-- behold their scourge andterror tread on emperors. Smile, stars, that reigned at my nativity and dim the brightness of your neighbor lamps, for I, the cheapest lamp of all the earth will send a fire to your turning spheres. Then when a sky shall wax as red as blood, it shall be said I made it red myself. That's it. That's why I've got to remember, use the words. "Tamburlaine, part one, author Kit Marlowe, address the [inaudible] fields. God rest your soul, my dear kid. Who is your favorite actor, boy? De Niro? No. Anthony Hopkins. You. Ha, how much did theyhave to pay you to say that? You want to know what? Apart from Cagney Stewart, Bogie, Tracey, all those old timers, like Frank Morgan, and [imitating actors] shy They really held their business together. God, bless you. You want to know something? I'd chuck all this Elizabethanmuck if I could only just once make it big on the screen. You really mean that? Damn right, I mean it. [piano music] Good morning. Good, good morning. You genius. You f-ing genius. What? It's marvelous. What it? Our new script. Oh, Fitz, you haven't gone and read it. I specifically wrote "hands off." I thought that was the title. It's catchy. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Oh, Fitz, I could smack you. You're glaring. But I'm furious. You were not supposed to read it. Hey, kid, it's good. You think? It's the cat's jammies. You think? I know. Oh, Fitz, give me a hug. It's the best partyou've ever written for me. Fitz, darling, Fitz, comeand sit down for a moment. It's true, when I started to write it, it was. It was for you. But as it turned out, it's just it's not the kind of part you play. Oh, don't be a cow. I can play anything. Oh, well, no. That isn't exactly accurate. Oh, the role fits me like a glove. Let me read you a few bits,and you'll see in a second. It's a romance, Fitz. Just what I need,romance, a change of pace. But it's about a married woman who takes a vacation from her marriage and falls in love with a gentle,tender European gentleman. But I can be tender,romantic, European, Australian, I can be a gent, I can be anything. I'm an actor. Yeah, I know. But, darling, this is a film. It's what you are that the camera picks up. And what am I then? m you're brilliant,electrifying, terrifying, shattering on stage. See, you're so silly. You don't even realize you wrote it for me. I'll read you a bit. You'll see it in an absolute second. Are you sitting down? Are you listening. She, I didn't know anyonelived in this castle. He, are you touring alone in Europe? She, and no. As a matter of fact, I'm on my vacation. Lilly? Yes, darling. He, a vacation from what? I don't know, from my life, I think. Actually, just whatpart are you reading for? But [inaudible]. She, how did you know I was married? He, I know a lot about you. I even know what your husband is like. If you want to play thewoman, the part is yours. One look at the wife,and you know the husband. Oh, you're back, Lilly. Oh, my darling Rosanna. Oh, you didn't wait up for us. No, just for you. If I waited up for him,I wouldn't get any sleep. Oh, thank you. You better get to bed. Goodnight, Lily. Bon wei, Mr. Wynn. Bon wei, pretentious cow. What is it with her? Why is she always callingyou Lily and me Mr. Wynn? Because she doesn't like you. I'm going to make some coffee. Swan? Who's there? Fitz, the lion. I don't want to safari. Fitz the wolf? I've gone to grandmother's. Fitz the moose. Vamoose. Oh, I've got the coffee. Oh, come in. Darling-- Oh, that's very kind. --you look absolutely edible,radiant, ravishing, exquisite. Thank you. My god, you look divine in that thing. I've had it on for hours, you know. How did you like the party? Boring, boring, boring. Oh, you seemed to be having a good time. Yes, every time. Darling? - Yes, I know what you want.- What? - The part. - You're right. Well, your not right. The director doesn'tthink you're right either. Oh. Yes, he's brilliant, Hungarian. Hungarian? Yeah, and the leadinglady doesn't think you're right either. Oh, you've cast the leadinglady already, have you? Yes. And who might she be? Alicia Braun. Alicia Braun. No, I don't seem to remember her. Well, you have worked with her. Oh, yes. We played beautifully together. Well, not in this one. I have got to take a shower. By the way, just where were you last night? I was with my co-producer. He doesn't think you're right either. Oh, he doesn't, does he? His name? Jerry. Oh, Jerry. Jerry? [frantic music playing] Traitor. Egregious snake. Wake up, you perfidious hermit, you slime. What do you want? I want to put my foot upyour mouth, that's what I want. Now, get out of that bed. Well, what's going on? Yes, play the innocentwith me, you damn sidewinder, you Judas, plotting with my wife behind my back. Hey, Lily is my client too. Who gave it to you, putz? Who's kept you going for 20 years? Before you met me, the only client you had was that sniveling fox terrierwho could barely cha-cha. I made a lot of money out of that animal. And who stood by you when every other agent in the country was crawling to get me? I'm on my knees. Good, where you belong. Now, just where did you getthe chutzspa to tell my wife that role was not for me? I told her because it's true. It was made for me. It's mine. Ah, what do you know? You're an actor. Your style is epic, largerthan life, dangerous. This isn't for you. This role was made for a marmalade. Leave it to the sweet guys. I can be sweet, you 10percenter, you rug merchant. All right, now you ask for it, and I'm going to give it to you straight. You messed up Lily's last two pictures, and I'm not letting you anywhere near this one. Messed them up? I was brilliant. You told me so yourself. I'm a congenital liar, a 10% hooker. When are you shooting? Next month. Where's the location? In Budapest. You cast the male lead in New York, right? My lips are sealed. Now, look, you thin Quasimodo. I've been good to you when youdidn't have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. You came to me. Yes, master. Best man at my wedding. Guilty. I've been serving time ever since. Oh, come on, Jerry. You're my greatest friend. I'm your only friend. And yet somehow, you always keep managing to hook at this hooker. What do you want? I'll do it. For my customaryjustifiably exorbitant fee. OK. Half of it. Jerry. I'll do it for nothing. Please? What do you say? Mr. Producer. [yawn] Hello, Poet. Oh, hello, ham. I thought I'd go out to Mainefor a few days, the cabin, put my feet up. Oh, how lovely. Do you want some company? No, I'll be working on my one-man Christopher Marlow evening. I'm touring it this summer. It's better if I'm alone. Oh, I'd like to see that. I just hope it doesn'tconflict with my Budapest trip. What are you up to? What's all that? Oh, it's a bunch of photographs. It's so hard. Oh, my god, all frogs and meatball. They're looking to somebody continental. Oh, yes, gentle, tender, loving. Yes. Well, he's got something. What? Oh, god, no, no. He's in love with himself. Yeah, I see what you mean. What exactly are you looking for? Well, nice looking, early '40s, modest, but manly, with that lovely simplicity that some Italians have. Why don't you go for blonde? A blonde? Yeah, a blonde. There are plenty of blondeItalians from the North. A blonde Italian, that's a good idea. When are you leaving? - Right now, this minute.- Oh, so soon? Got the last, got the last. Darling, are you going in your pajamas? Oh. Fitz, Fitz, did you take a sweater? Got it. Oh, did you take some booze? The liquor stores are closed. I have everything. Have fun. Is it not passing brave to be a king and ride in triumph through Persepolis? Save it to the customers, [inaudible].. [clock ticking sound] [clock tolling] Campaign. Yes. It's so cheering. And you said we had something to celebrate? Yes, I found your leading man. No. No, no, no. Who? Who? His name is Roberto Terranova. Roberto Terranova. I've never heard of him. Well, he's Italian. He did some pictures for Fellini as a boy. He did some Italian television,very independent type. Well? Can he act? Oh, we had him read. It's the kind of acting thatdoesn't seem like acting. The camera loves him. How's his English? Perfect. Nice. He's Italian. Can I see him? That's the only problem. He spent just one day in New York. Oh, that's too bad. He's very blonde. Yeah, we've got to move fast on this. Maybe we should just give the part to Fitz. No. No. Hello? Poet? Oh, hello, ham. I'm back. Come on up here. Hurry. Hi. I missed you. Yeah? You miss me? You just wait until Iunpack and I'll show you. Oh, no. You unpack later. I want to ask your opinion or something. Now, wait a minute. What do you think of this actor? Roberto Terranova. He's OK. OK. Oh, come on. He's a bit better than that. What's he got a rug on his head? No, I don't think that. Jerry assures me he's 100% natural. He says the camera loves him. And his mother too. Got, what an awful lot of teeth. There's a sweet smile there, don't you think? Too sweet. Oh, come on. Give him a break. Don't you think he's got a nice,tender, beseeching quality? No edges. Edges are exactly what I don't want. Well, you'll get a nice dull movie out of him. Oh, you're not going tolike anybody I pick, are you? Well, what the hell do you expect? Oh, he's got a pretty nice kissy, actually. Well, I don't know. Perhaps you are right. You usually are. No, I think not. I'll see you later. MAN [ON RECORDING]: Good morning. Buongiorno.

She is the brain, the feeling. A man must love all of her. Well, that's pretty heady stuff, Roberto. Heady?What does this mean heady? Heady? It means you're very nice. Should we go in? What is it with you? You are always advancing, retreating, advancing, retreating. Ever since I am met you, Inever know where I am with you. Well, you'll just have to find out, won't you? You're not a serious woman. Oh, I am. I'm a lot more serious than you think. Then seriously, whatdo you look for in a man? What does any woman look for in a man? Fun, romance. Is that all?

No, he was magnificent. Well, well, yes, hehandled the verse very well. Don't you think 48 is a bit old for Romeo? Oh, but he was so young. He nearly got away with it. He's one of the four or five great actors. But I'll tell you something,you're as good as he is. You think? I know. That is compliment. Yes, I know the real thing when I see it? Do you? But did you see his "Tamburlaine." Oh. Many, many times. Roberto, I thought youcame down here to see me. Who wants to talk about that shit head. Shit head? No, no, not a shit head exactly. Let's face it. He is a mess. A mess? No, he is. No, he is a shit head. I stand by it. Well, you're in the theater. You know how actors can be. How are they? Selfish. It's so? Yes. When they're looking at you, they're not. They're not really looking at you. They're just looking at you tosee how their performance is going over. Fitz is like that. But he's a great talent. He's stupeno. - Oh, well, yes. Perhaps. But you can't eat stupendo forbreakfast, lunch, and dinner. Oh, anyway, let's face it. He's not very bright. No? No. You can't imagine what I haveto do to get through to him. I try to do it in thedialogue I write for him, send him little messages. But he never gets it. Still, it amuses me to hearhim say the same lines over and over again every night. It does, does it? Why do you marry him? Well, I saw him on the stage, and I fell in love with his talent. Just unfortunately, the man turned out to be not quite so big as his talent. But if he is so stupid and such shit head, why you stay with him? Now that is a very good question. There must be something nice about him, no? Maybe he's a nice lover? No. Well, no, nothing to write home about. Does he know this? Well, no. No, I wouldn't. I wouldn't hurt him for the world. You lied to him then in the bed? Roberto, all women lie to menin bed, perhaps even to you. Lily, you are a beautiful woman. Oh, come on. No, look, around your eyes,the corners of your mouth. Happiness did that, I am betting. Your husband must haveloved you very much once. Did he? Once. Lily, come with me. Come. Come. Sit. Put your hands on the arms. Who is it? It's you. And who am I? The only man in the world. It's not fair that we haveto find each other so late. With your husband, was he ever like this? It's been so long, I can't remember. Can you? I'll make some coffee. Good morning, darling. Oh, good morning. Oh, welcome to Hungary. Thank you, darling. I wondered how long you'dlast without a cigarette. I hadn't thoughtadultery was in your line. Oh? I didn't think blond Italians were in yours. No, but you were completely taken in. Darling, no, not completely. Oh? Actually, it was a very good performance. Oh, thank you. It went a littleoverboard with the charm, didn't you think? I do not. Oh, I liked it. I liked it. Our lives have been a little short of charm, wouldn't you say? Overboard. I have never been accusedof going overboard. I don't care what you say. He totally convinced you. No, he didn't. I think he nearly convinced you. No, actually, I did believe a lot of it. But I do know the real thing when I see it. Do you? Yes. Come on, Fitz, how long we been married? Too long, I suppose. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, for goodness sake. Have some coffee. We've got to turn that charm back on. We're shooting again later. Not with this charm, you're not. Fitz, did you have a nice night? Is everything OK? Is everything OK? You gum-brained idiot? There's three dead bodies lying in there. This ridiculous little Casanova you dreamt up. He's all yours. Our marriage and my whole bloody life. Fitz. Fitz. What do we do now about the movie? What do we do about the movie? My marriage has just been shot to hell, and you say what do we do about the movie. Don't you care? Of course, I care. You two have been plotting behind my back all along, first to get him the role, and then to get him toromance me in Italian drag. You must think I'm a perfect fool. Are you sure you didn'tknow it was Fitz the minute you laid eyes on Roberto? I don't know. I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I didn't know what I thought. All I know is that there was this warm, tender, loving man, all the things thatFitz hasn't been for years. And now look at this mess you've got us into. You've got to get us out of it, Jerry. I'll be brilliant. [music playing] Ticket to New York, please. To New York? That's right, New York, USA, America. [speaking italian] Yes, call a press conference. Get a mob of reporters. Yeah, well, grease their palms with silver. Tell them it's an artistic eventof international importance. Yes, and listen. Listen, Roberto Terranovabella, Roberto Terranova is Fitzroy Wynn. Yes. Yes. Play it up big. Get a big cake. Cameras, and flashbulbs,and microphones. He can't resist a microphone. Yes, lots of television cameras, flashbulbs, microphones. What do you mean I can't leave the country? I'm Fitzroy Wynn, the actor.This is outrageous. Where is your visa? I have told you. I have no visa, you silly little man. Where is your passport? Oh, now you want my passport. Well, this is my passport. Oh, no, no, no, no. This is my passport. Oh, so I haven't got one. Does it matter? Everybody knows me. What did you say your name was? Roberto Terranova. No, Fitzroy Wynn. Now, look, would you listen to me just very carefully for a moment. See, sometimes I am Roberto Terranova. You understand? And sometimes I am Fitzroy Wynn. Now, you get me out ofthis godforsaken country, or I'll be forced to call the American ambassador. There is no American ambassador. Oh, there is no American ambassador. Well, then let me ask you something. Would you like to be theman responsible for a rather unattractive international incident? And you will get me out of thiscountry today at once, now. There are no planes to[inaudible] tomorrow morning. No planes? Oh, excuse me. Excuse me. [interposing voices] Mr. Wynn, statement for "The Trib." Please, is it true that Fitzroy Wynn is really Roberto Terranova. I haven't anything to discuss now. I'm sorry. Please, please, I've been extremely ill. This has all been a shattering experience. Now, if you'll excuse me. Please, I have told you I have nothing to say. [non-english speech] Just one more question, sir. Darling, I knew it was you all the time. The fuck you did. Oh, yes, I think it's a sweetlittle country [inaudible].. Where are they all going?What's the matter? Oh, peasants. The insensitive and delicatemistiming of the press never ceases to baffle me. Mr. Wynn, we've been toldthat what you have done is one of the mostextraordinary acting feats in the history of the cinema. Oh? Really? Are they really saying that? Yes. Well, perhaps you betterall come in and hear my side. The fact is that-- good lord, what's all this? Well, the fact is-- the truth is that in my foolish innocence, I never could resist a challenge. And Coriolanus, Lear, "Tamburlaine." Your Roberto Terranova role, was that all a stunt to sell the picture? Oh, no. Good god, no. I never thought that for a moment. It's simply that we actors have to stretch ourselves from time to time. That's all. I never would have dreamed that I could have thrown so much ofmy own life into this project. But we must experiment. We must take chances. And sometimes we make mistakes. It happens to the best of us. It happened here in Budapest. And so it grieves me to have totell you that as of tomorrow, Fitzroy when will no longer be in this-- I'm terribly sorry. Fitzroy Wynn will nolonger be in this picture. Now, all of you, get the hell out. [inaudible] Go. Out. Adieu. Arrivederci. Auf Weidersehen. Goodbye. [phone ringing] Fitzy? Can I just very calmlystate a few facts to you? Fact one, we are the partnersof the Hungarian government. You are not being a nice partner. Fact two, you have just put 58people out of work, including Istvan, that nice little grip with the club foot who's supporting his widowed mother and his sister whosehusband ran away to Canada. They are all counting on you. That is the burden of being a star. Now, in all the time I've known you, you've been selfish, vain, inconsiderate, a bully to your friends, anda lousy husband to your wife, but you have never been unprofessional. The name Fitzroy Wynn stoodfor something in the theater. Well, you slipped uppretty badly today, buddy. Come out of their, Fitz. You're better than this. [goose call] MAN: Your husband, who's the master. MAN: Very good. The woman? MAN: Very good cooking. MAN: Sounds great. But the American woman,she got good taste, yeah? Yeah. My wife is very large in the brain department. She writes all the lines. I just spit them out. Fitz, it's Lily, Lily the swan, Lily the dove, Lily the goose. Thank you. [horse whinnying] [laughter] [murmuring] Am I really as starved as all that? Cara mia, you were ravenous. Ravenous. Ravenous. You are a hard woman to match. You're so stingy. Stingy. Well, I should have knownbetter than to marry an actor. The woman was beloved, loved, loved. Yes, yes, but he's fallenin love with himself. He's not a remarkable Joe, is he? No, but I'll never get tired of your voice. [gasp] Whore out of hell. Oh, my god, it's my husband. Take a walk. Take a walk. I'll make thee with theearth had swallowed thee. [gunshot] [gunshot] Please, don't. [gunshot] Why do you try and eat someof your beloved goose liver, you quivering pompous. I don't like very much the goose. Eat. [speaking italian] Eat. I eat. [speaking italian] I eat. My I eat. Caio, Bambino. Caio. [gunshot] I adore you. Now you tell me. [applause] [sirens] Swan? Fitz the lion. Fitz the wolf? Fitz the man? Hello, lamb. Were you looking for me? Well, yes. I wanted to ask you something. I have had these annoying littlesuspicions that you actually wanted me to find your script. Have you? Yeah. I don't know. It's just silly of me, I suppose. But it did occur to me thatyou cooked this whole thing up. Why would I do a thing like that? Oh, no, no, no. I'm probably wrong. I usually am. Lily-- Should we have a drink? Ol . What's wrong? I don't know. I just never seem toknow where I am with you. I'm on your side, shit head. [gong] Are you coming? I'll be in my room. I just wanted to make a few notes. I've got a very good idea for a script. [music playing] You're still the star I wish upon. I know you'll always be,because I see as time goes on how you still shine for me. And after all is said anddone, it hasn't been in vain. You've always been the only one. And this will never change. Far beyond the dreams we dreamed. Promises we made. Acting out a million scenes,when love's a double play. Throughout my lie, charade with you, it's here my heart remains. No other love could be so true,and this will never change. And after all is said and done,it's here my heart remains. You've always been the onlyone, and this will never change. And this will never change.
