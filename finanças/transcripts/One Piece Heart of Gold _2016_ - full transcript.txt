How many times do I have to tell you?! I said "I just wanna eat meat"! I'm sorry! Boy! If you don't have any meat, bring me more sweets and stuff! It's still gonna take a while before we reach Marie Jois! We don't know when we'll be attacked! --Everybody, keep up your guard! --Yes, sir! I managed to get out of that crappy place, but I got caught by these crappy people... Crap! I've been looking for a chance to escape... ...but no luck. I can hear you. Where did you hide the Pure Gold? Hmph! I wouldn't tell you even if I knew! Is the World Government seeking the treasure that's worth enough to buy the whole world? How greedy is that? But... ...it's all mine. Because I'm greedier than you! What?! What?! What's going on?! Get back! Okay... This is my chance to escape. We can hear you! Take evasive action! We can't see where they're attacking from at all! How can you not see the enemy ship on the water?! Where is it? Where are they attacking from?! Hey! Don't you see anything up there?! I don't! I don't see a thing! Who are you?! I was born in the North Blue... I ate the Color-Color Fruit and became a camouflage human... Psycho P! Are you surprised? My cool graffiti! I hope you know. Tesoro-sama is very interested in the Pure Gold. So be sure... ...not to kill the girl. Shut up. You're sobering me up. I won't screw up by sinking our treasure. Here goes! Four warships aren't enough to stop me. Mad Anchor! Camoufla-paint! Hey! Where are you?! Your never-give-up attitude isn't half bad! Naomi... Psycho P... Hey, my boss... It's a treasure hunt! That hurts! I said, "That hurts!" We can't let you have it. The Pure Gold belongs to the World Government! No! The Pure Gold is all... ...mine! I found you, Myskina Olga... You're the key to the Pure Gold! You're quite strong. Are you one of those Devil Fruit eaters? You want the Pure Gold too, don't you? I can show you the way if you want. You're unexpectedly obedient, young lady. But only if you can get me out of here. Stop! Don't speak so freely. How did you know about the girl?! I have a patron who gives me information about the Government. Who is it?! I'm not obliged to answer that! I can't believe they sent out Cipher Pol Aigis Zero. I guess the Celestial Dragons are desperate to have the Pure Gold, aren't they?! I don't need to answer that! They're fighting really hard. This is my chance to run. We can hear you! Chain Hammer! There's nowhere to run now, Little Betty. What the...?! He has some strange ability. You'd better give up now. All right, take us to the legendary island, Alchemi! I don't like classless guys like you! Elizabeth! Idiot! There is a place to run! Idiot! Idiot! She's got an associate. Don't kill her. This is interesting. Let's let her go for now. Will it be okay? You sure? Tell Tesoro... ...that I'll get the Pure Gold at any price! All right, then I'm gonna go back to Gran Tesoro. This will tell you where it's anchored. There is a Vivre Card from Tesoro-sama inside. He said he'll pay whatever you want as a reward. I don't care about money. I have no interest in the treasures that I've gotten already. They're already dead to me. They don't excite me at all. I'm a treasure hunter. I just wanna be drunk on the excitement of the moment when I find a treasure! I'm sorry. We were attacked by Mad Treasure. And we let Myskina Olga escape. Find her no matter what. If you let anybody else have the Pure Gold, you know what'll happen to you. Yes, sir. A gentle smile and a dignified smile Your adorable smile Silver hearts and gold hearts I'll give them all to you Alchemi, Alchema Hold the gold star Alchemi, Alchema Go into a dream Now I've managed to escape, but I'll die of hunger like this. I gotta do something. What's that straw hat symbol? Are they pirates? That pirate looks like an idiot. He looks weak. --Chopper-san, are you all right?! --Yeah! I'm gonna fish more! All right, I'm gonna fish more too! Look! A lizard is running on the water! How can you do that? You put your left leg forward before your right leg sinks. I can do that. A girl is on its back! Seems like she's unconscious! We gotta save her! Leave it to me! --Now's your chance! --Yeah! Yes! What?! What is it this time?! Oh? What are a lizard and a kid doing here? You're causing us more trouble. How did they get here? I caught them. It's strange... What? Is something wrong with her? It's odd! I don't see any wound and her pulse is stable, so I don't think she's in a life-threatening condition... Is she just sleeping, then? You don't wanna sleep here. You're gonna catch cold. Okay, let's just wake her up! You're up! Thank you for saving me... Don't move! Oh, she's good. Elizabeth! Come here! All right, don't try to come closer! He's a hostage! If you wanna save your friend's life, give me some water and food! I'm hungry and it's driving me mad! Move quickly or... ...I'll just park my blade right here! There's no point in taking Luffy hostage... Why are you guys ignoring me?! I said water and food! If you're hungry, do you wanna eat this? I'm not gonna eat such a salty thing! You guys are just a goofy, weak group of pirates! Elizabeth and I can easily destroy you! She says "no sweat" as well. What? Do you understand what Elizabeth is saying? Yeah. Oh, wow! I mean, you're... ...so fluffy and cute! Your compliment doesn't make me happy at all, you jerk! You're so cute! She's wide open. Luffy-san has been freed as well. You're so horrible. You almost got me. You were trying to lower my guard with your cuteness, weren't you? That was close. What?! That brat... How has she survived being that stupid? Give me water and food... now! Are you okay?! Eat it. You put poison or something in there, didn't you?! I'm a cook. I wouldn't do anything to waste food. Now, you can't eat holding that, can you? Don't rush. I'll make you as much as you want. She says, "Thank you for feeding Olga." Olga, after you eat, you need to tell us why you did this. Oh... That pattern... Is that the script of Alchemi? Alchemi? Damn! I can't believe someone noticed. What's that? Alchemi is a legendary island that suddenly disappeared 200 years ago. Did you have enough? I've never had anything this delicious before! Hey! Tell us about Alchemi. In Alchemi, there was a person named Myskina Acier who was doing research on how to refine metal, I heard. He created a metal called Pure Gold. Pure Gold? It's a legendary metal. They say it even shines in darkness and it's worth a fortune, enough to even buy the whole world. People have been looking for the Pure Gold since the earliest times. However, those who obtain it ruin themselves. This Pure Gold thing is unbelievable. A legendary metal, huh?! "It's worth a fortune, enough to even buy the whole world"?! I want it! Do you have anything to do with Alchemi? Do you know where the treasure is? Tell us! I won't tell you! You're a horrible liar. Saying "I won't tell you" is almost like admitting that you know where it is. Where is Alchemi?! Even if I tell you, it's impossible for you weak pirates to get it. You're not gonna believe where it's located. It sounds interesting! We'll take you to Alchemi. Dangerous people are everywhere in the New World. We can protect you if we're with you. I don't need any help from others! I've been living by myself for so long! I only interact with other people to take advantage of them. You're just a kid, but you've been through a lot! Your pity won't make my stomach full. What the... When did you change? Oh, this?! We need to be prepared if we're gonna hunt for the treasure! All right! Let's go treasure hunting! What? I haven't said I'm coming with you yet. The Straw Hat Treasure Gang! Go! Listen to me! You can't stop them once they get into that zone. Olga. We need to talk. About what? We have nine people on our side, but we can do with 6:4 for the ratio of the share. Of course, you take "6"! Weak pirates like you guys can't get to the Pure Gold anyway. We guarantee you we will. Look! We have this many champs worth over 100 million. We'll also offer you the service of taking you to any island you like after exchanging the treasure for money. I give you such a special offer because of our friendship. Isn't it a good deal? Hmph! Honestly! Okay, so these people are strong. That means I can use these Straw Hat idiots as much as I like... ...to get the Pure Gold and betray them in the end. I can have it all to myself that way! I heard everything you said. So that's how it is, and... ...Olga has agreed to guide us to Alchemi! But she's gonna betray us in the end, so be careful! And how are you gonna guide us? Do you have an Eternal Pose or something? I have this. This will lead us to Alchemi. There's a piece of Pure Gold inside this ring, you see. What?! Pure Gold?! Let me see! No! If I let it shine in a place like this, it's gonna be a problem! Hey, you damn Moss Head! I know. You don't have to call me that every time, Dirty Cook! What's this? I feel something is here! What?! What's going on?! There must be enemies. Tsk! I don't like stubborn guys. It's... ...Mad Treasure! Do you know him? He's a treasure hunter who'd do anything to get what he wants. He's the worst. I can't believe you detected the camouflage. Seems like even Psycho P's ability is no match for Observation Haki. The ability of camouflage?! What's wrong? Are you okay? It's nothing, Robin-chan. Hey, you Dirty Water Imp! Do you know that guy too? No... I wish I had known... Are you guys after the Pure Gold too? Yeah! We're gonna go on a treasure hunt with her! I let her go so that she could guide us to Alchemi. I'm not happy with some pirates stealing our guide to the Pure Gold! Crap! It's started! --Let's go! --Yeah! Oh, now that I've gotten a good look at them, it's clear that they're the Straw Hats who are drawing so much attention in the New World. This is gonna be fun. Exploding Star! Dos Fleurs! Clutch! You guys really are strong! I'll protect you even if it kills me! Oh, I'm already dead! Luffy is the guy who took down the infamous Doflamingo! What? What's a Doflamingo? Olga, you really don't know anything... Well, just watch. You'll see that it's a pretty safe bet to go on an adventure with us. Gum-Gum... ...Gatling! This is great. The stronger the enemy you fight over treasure, the more exciting treasure hunting gets! Young lady. Cheating is bad. I'll go along with your treasure hunt to the end! No, I don't want you! I don't like classless guys like you! Olga has already become our ally! I'm the one who decides that! Straw Hat! The guide to the Pure Gold is mine now! That's not up to you to decide! You bastard! No, fools! She'll die if you keep pulling! Something's gonna come out of me! I knew she had it! Is that... ...the Pure Gold?! The treasure that can even buy the whole world is... The treasure sank into the seal! So why don't you guys go away already?! Olga, are you okay? I almost threw up. Oh, no! Bonbori-sama's gonna come! Bonbori-sama...? What's that? --Isn't that too big?! --Yes! That's a giant footballfish. Bonbori-sama. H-Hey! This is bad news, isn't it?! My boss, let's pull out! Franky, make an emergency escape with Coup de Burst! Okay! Guys! Hang on to something! The Emergency Escape System! Coup de...! Wait! You shouldn't run! What are you talking about?! Do you really wanna look for the Pure Gold? Yeah, because it sounds interesting. Then, let me tell you something. The phantom island, Alchemi, is... ...located inside Bonbori-sama's stomach! I thought the Pure Gold sank into the sea earlier... That was just a tiny piece of it! A really jumbo piece of Pure Gold is in there! A really jumbo piece of Pure Gold?! Franky! Bring us about 180 degrees! Okay! Wait a sec! If you want a really jumbo piece of Pure Gold, head into the mouth! --Okay! --No, you idiot! Don't do it! We're gonna die if we get chewed up! My boss! We're gonna sail in there too! It looks interesting! Well, we have no choice but to go. This is an adventure! Oh, no! The Pure Gold! We've been completely devoured! If nothing is done, we'll be digested and be nothing but bones. Oh! I'm already nothing but bones! They followed us! They came into the mouth?! They must be out of their minds! So are you all! Here they come! Avoid the uvula! Uvula? That's big. He wants to make us crash into the uvula! I know! But...! The uvula is huge! Gum-Gum... ...Balloon! Nice, Luffy! Luffy-san, grab my hand! Yeah! --Luffy! --Luffy-san! Those who get in our way are destined for hell! Oh, no! Luffy's gonna die! What? Why? Devil Fruit eaters can't swim because the sea hates them. They can't even use their abilities, so they'll just drown. In that case, it's not a bad idea to have them owe me a favor or two. Elizabeth! I'll save Luffy! Whoa, whoa, will she be okay? Tsk! What a pain! --Sanji-kun! --Yes, Nami-san! Leave Luffy with Olga and stay here! Luffy's in trouble, but... ...seems like we're also in trouble. We passed the uvula, but now we're gonna fall through the throat, straight into the stomach! And we'll be broken down to pulp by gastric juices. Quit the scary thoughts! Guys! Don't get thrown off! Now... How is it gonna be? It's one of the most exciting treasure hunts ever! I'm losing strength... Luffy! I'm coming to save you! Where am I? Anyway, I gotta find everyone else. Ouch! Be careful. If you soak in Bonbori-sama's gastric juice, you'll be dissolved. Oh, you're alive! Cut the crap! If I hadn't saved you, you would've been in trouble! Drowned! Sunk! Dissolved! And you would've been dead by now. You should thank me, and have a sense of obligation! All right. Thanks! Thank you too, Elizabeth! If you thank me without protesting like that, it makes me feel like I'm an evil-minded jerk who expects something in return. Olga! --Are we in the stomach? --That's right. There's even an island! It's so big! It must be one of the islands Bonbori-sama swallowed. Bonbori-sama has three giant stomachs like this. We're in the first stomach now. If you go through the second stomach and get to the third stomach, you'll find the island of Alchemi, where the Pure Gold is. We're in the stomach, but it's nice and bright here. Yeah, thanks to Bonbori-sama's lamp. Since its light is so strong, it goes through its body and even reaches inside the stomach. So it's bright in here all the time. You sure know a lot about it. Oh, no. If nothing is done, we'll be eaten. Gum-Gum Pistol! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Well done, Straw Hat! Finally, I get to... I get to... Do you have something against them? Finally, I get to... eat it! Oh, I'm full! My dream of 200 years finally came true. 200 years?! For 200 years, I've only been living on fish that washed ashore and fruits on the island. So it's been my dream to eat as much meat as I want. "For 200 years" means you're like a very old grandma! That's so rude! If I'm a grandma, you're a grandpa! You look a lot older than me. I've only been alive for 19 years. You're so much younger than me. You've been living for 200 years, but you don't look old. That's amazing! Are you sure? |I am. I was swallowed by Bonbori-sama 200 years ago. 200 years ago, I was living on the island of steel, Alchemi, with my parents. But after my crappy old man, who was a crappy scientist, created the Pure Gold, everything went wrong. Pirates who heard about the Pure Gold came and killed my mother. It's your fault, Dad! If you hadn't created the Pure Gold, this never would have happened! I'm gonna throw out this piece of junk! And I was swallowed along with the island, Alchemi. What happened to your dad? I guess he died when we were swallowed. That served him right. I'm the only survivor... And for 200 years thereafter, I've been living in this stomach all by myself. I see. You've been through a lot. It wasn't so bad! It's actually quite nice to live here. But I managed to get out of here by accident a while ago. And when I was playing around outside, I got caught by a group of freaks. Then do you know how to get out of here? I do. If you wanna get out of here with your friends and the Pure Gold, you have to listen to me! Okay! I'm counting on you! Well, leave it to me. Olga, I was worried that you might've died! Now, I want you to guide us to the Pure Gold! It's been decided that she's going on an adventure with me. I'm sorry, but why don't you ask someone else? All right, but... ...the best part of treasure hunting is robbing someone of theirs! Gatling! Gum-Gum... ...Jet Stamp! That's what I expected of a man with a bounty of 500 million. You're a wonderful opponent who makes my treasure hunt so much more exciting. But... ...you can't go any farther! I'm sorry, Luffy! We were captured when we fell into water and became helpless. Luffy... Don't move! Stop! If they're so important to you, don't move an inch! Chain Lock! --Luffy! --Luffy-san! You're not playing fair! Don't get me wrong! I'm not here for a head-on confrontation! I'm here for treasure hunting! I'll do whatever it takes to get the treasure! Now, Olga! Straw Hat drops out here! Show me the way to the Pure Gold! Otherwise, I'm gonna kill everybody, including you! On one condition. I want you to share the Pure Gold half-and-half with me! Half-and-half?! You're quite greedy! I know how to get out of Bonbori-sama. So even if we get the Pure Gold, we still have to follow your lead until we get out of here. All right! I promise! Olga! He'll kill you after you get out! Just leave us and run! It's your fault because you can't go on an adventure to the Pure Gold with me! I hope your ship won't be dissolved in the sea of gastric juice! The Shark Emeralda is hardened by steel and jewels. It's extremely sturdy! And I have a favor to ask. I don't want you to kill Straw Hat here. You two sure became fast friends. It's nothing like that. I'm a kid. I won't be able to sleep at night out of fear if I see a dead body. Olga... That's really cute! Even if it's a lie, I'll go along with it! I have to make sure to keep you happy until we get the Pure Gold! The tide of gastric juice will begin to come in to this beach soon. So suffer and die a slow death. Straw Hat! You'll be dissolved here! --Luffy! --Damn! Luffy! Damn! What?! It's late! I can't believe it's this late for feeding time! I'm gonna be too hungry! Hey! Let me out! You jerk! All right! Gum-Gum... ...Stamp! I was almost fed to them. Oh, they look delicious. I can't catch them like this. I didn't expect to meet a human in Bonbori-sama's stomach! You! Ouch! What are you...?! Some kind of monster?! How rude! If you look carefully, you can tell I'm a human right away! I don't have to look carefully to tell you're... ...a human, aren't you? You don't look like a human, either. This chain goes on top like this and... It's quite complicated. Okay, you're free! Oh, thank you, old man! No, I thank you. It's really been a while since I talked with another human. You were swallowed by Bonbori-sama too, weren't you?! Yeah, it was 200 years ago. I got swallowed along with the island I was living on. I somehow survived without being dissolved by the gastric juice, but... ...there are so many dinosaurs here for some reason. I couldn't escape, either. So I survived by pretending to be one of them. It was like "meat, meat, meat." My diet consisted of almost no vegetables at all. How picky can you get?! What's wrong with meat?! There was somebody here who's been eating only vegetables and fruits for 200 years! Is there somebody else in here other than me and you?! Yeah, there's a funny girl named Olga! Olga?! Olga is my daughter. I can't believe she's alive. I couldn't be happier. Oh, yeah! Where is she now?! She's been captured by a guy named Mad Treasure. I'm gonna go save Olga and my friends! Goodbye, old man! Thank you for unchaining me! Take me with you! I have to save my daughter! All right. Let's go together! I'm Luffy! We gotta build a ship! A ship that won't be dissolved in the sea of gastric juice! Could you wait here for a while? I'll go look for materials. Shouldn't we just ride on this? Well, Water Lizards do have the ability to cross the sea of gastric juice, but... Please! Let us ride on you! All right, let me ask him. I see. If you can make him laugh in a staring contest, he'll become friends with you, he said. That's amazing! Do you understand what he says? Yeah, I've been pretending to be a dinosaur for two centuries. Okay, got it! Gum-Gum... Darn! He's good! Luffy-kun, trying to make your opponent laugh by force is what second-raters do. The important thing in comedy is... contrast! Like the gap between my beautiful smug face and over-the-top funny face! This equation for comedy is perfect and excellent! First, my beautiful face... Smug face! You're funny! What's wrong? Nothing. It worked out, so that's all right. I'm counting on you, Chavez! This is too much for my bones... I wonder if Luffy's okay. Yeah, I'm worried about Zoro, Sanji, and Franky too. You two are lucky. All you gotta do is beat the drum. Won't the Sunny be dissolved by Bonbori-sama's gastric water and disappear? --Don't say such an ominous thing. --Oh, I'm sorry. Don't worry. Whatever happens, they're not gonna die. It's gonna be all right! You're right. You slaves! Stop talking and keep rowing. Mad Treasure. Oh, you're... ...the Cat Burglar from back then. Do you want me to torment you again? I have friends this time! I'm not gonna be defeated by a guy like you! You have friends? It doesn't matter. You shouldn't trust your friends anyway. You two have run into each other before? Yes, a little bit, a long time ago. I once stole his treasure. When I got to his safe, somebody else was already there, stealing. She was one of my chief competitors. We slipped up and both of us got caught by Mad Treasure. Then... ...she used me as a decoy and never came back. Because of her, I was almost killed. So I was right. I shouldn't trust others. I should just take advantage of them. That's not true. Friends aren't the people you betray. They're the people you trust. I'm sure Luffy and the others will come save us. It's the second stomach from here. The color of the water looks dangerous! What's wrong, Chavez? Oh no! His legs are starting to be dissolved! Let's let him rest on an island! The Sunny! Sunny! I'm glad to see you! Is that your ship? Yes, it's the Thousand Sunny! Who are you boys? Oh! Zoro! Sanji! Franky! Aren't they your friends?! I kill you. I'll dish you up! I'll take your life! You guys are acting weird. Hiyaaah! Gum-Gum... ...Pistol! What happened to you guys?! Why are there so many of you?! Luffy-kun, don't you think they're fake? Are they?! My throw-ups... You noticed they were fake! I pay you a lot of respect! But I need you to finish yourselves off right here! Copy Paint! Wow! There are a bunch of Zoros! But their bodies haven't changed... I'm not scared of the funny Zoros! Next is this! Which one is the real old man?! Damn! It's annoying, so I'll just beat the crap out of you all! Don't! If you hit me, I'm pretty sure that I'm gonna die! --He's right! He's right! --This is really annoying! Oh, yeah! Old man, make the face you made earlier. You mean the smug face? All right... Look! This will prove that I'm the real one! Smug face! You really are funny! Gum-Gum Gatling! He's extremely strong. Old man, that face is really hilarious! I'm kind of hurt, but at least it worked out. Camoufla-paint! Paying respect to your strong power... ...| spare your life for now and I'm fading out... What's with that guy? Old man, we gotta go too! Finally, it's the third stomach! That's the island where I was born and where the Pure Gold is hidden, Alchemi! The Pure Gold is in a laboratory deep in this abandoned mine. There's some writing. Nico Robin, you're an archaeologist, aren't you? Read it for us! All right. "Those who invade this land seeking glimmering gold... ...must pay the price with death." Death... With death?! "My name is Myskina Acier." Acier?! Do you know who that is? Yes, I know him too well. He's my crappy old man who created the Pure Gold! What the...?! B-Boss... We've been wiped out... He's dead! Those who went first must've been caught in a trap. I'm starting to smell the sweet scent of danger! I-I'm already dead. So if it's just some simple traps, I-I'm not gonna die, because I'm dead. Looks like there's a trap in this room. Peacock Organ... "Only those who can play the right notes and those who have a pure mind can approach the bright gold.” What does that mean? I think... ...if you can play the organ exactly as it's written in the score there, you survive. But if you fail, a rain of arrows comes down. Really?! You can count on me for playing an instrument. I'm a musician. That's perfect! But don't even make a single mistake! It'll mean death... ...for you and... ...your friends! I'm aware of that, of course! I'll even risk my life for my friends! Although I already don't have life! We're counting on you, Brook! This is a beautiful lullaby. This song is... A gentle smile and a dignified smile Your adorable smile Silver hearts and gold hearts I'll give them all to you --What's the matter?! --He stopped playing! I may not look it, but I'm a musician! Even if the score isn't perfect, I'll try to see what the writer wanted, and play it right! This is how the next part should be! What is it? Cien Fleurs! Robin-san! Continue playing, okay? Yes! This time... All right! Play the right notes this time! We'll take care of the arrows! Okay! I'll leave them in your hands! Mil Fleurs! Gigantesco Mano! Chopper and Robin's Vortex! I can't believe it! He's... He's trusting his friends and not running from such a terrible situation! I can't figure out the next part! I'm still too unskilled. I'm not really getting what the writer wanted to express with this song! If it keeps on like this, Robin-san and Chopper-san will get hurt! I want... I want some kind of a clue! Follow my singing! Olga! It's dangerous there! Come back! ♪ A gentle smile and a dignified smile ♪ ♪ Your adorable smile ♪ ♪ Silver hearts and gold hearts ♪ ♪ I'll give them all to you ♪ ♪ Alchemi, Alchema ♪ ♪ Hold the gold star ♪ ♪ Alchemi, Alchema ♪ ♪ Go into a dream ♪ How's that? Seems like you played it right. The door to the next room has opened. Don't drop dead just yet. I'll be in trouble if my handy "tools" get broken. Olga-san, thanks to you, I felt what the writer was feeling and it touched me to the bones! The song is filled with a parent's love for his or her child. How could you sing it? That's because my mom used to sing it for me when I was little. You were loved so much! That's not true! But that crappy old man... Why did he bother using my favorite song? My boss! We have a problem! What's wrong? You killed all of Straw Hat's friends, didn't you? Straw Hat Luffy is alive! He's so tenacious! You guys, stand guard at the entrance. Don't let anybody in! --Luffy's okay, as we thought! --Yeah! It's gonna be okay if we can hold up until he comes! Old man, how much longer will it take? Okay, it's done. According to my calculation, Chavez's legs will be okay like this till we get to Alchemi. Hey, do you need help? Cut the crap! You actually can't carry it any longer, can you? Who do you think you're talking to, you spiral-eyebrowed Dirty Water Imp?! Oh? Aren't they your friends? Maybe they're fake again! I gotta hit them to see if they're real! Gum-Gum... ...Pistol! --Gum-Gum? --Is that Luffy? You posers! Hey, Luffy! It's me! Me! Are you the real one?! No, you could be just a strong poser! No-Sword Style Dragon Twister! Here's the proof that I'm the real one! They're the real Zoro and Sanji! --We are! --Don't give us trouble! Old man, they're my friends! They're as strong as you. I feel like I'm in good hands. Right? Yo, Luffy! You're okay, as I thought! Franky! Where are the others? Are they having lunch or something somewhere? Nami and the others are... They're all being held by the chain guy and were taken somewhere! --What?! --Seriously?! I grasp the situation! I'll alter the Sunny to be able to cross the sea of acid! But it'll take a while to beef up the Sunny to prevent it from being dissolved. So give me some time. No, I can't wait! When I think of the things they could be doing to Nami-san and Robin-chan at this moment, I feel like I'm going insane with rage! Does he fly?! Sky Walk! Nami-san, Robin-chan! I'm on my way! We're gonna go now too! I'll catch up with you later after I beef up the Sunny! --I'll leave it to you! --So, where is the chain guy now? He's probably at Alchemi, where the Pure Gold is! Okay, let's go! Old man, guide us! "The Eagle Bridge. Those worthy of the bright gold... ...must have both excellent power of concentration and bold courage. Hit the saintly eagle and build the bridge." Will the bridge come down if we hit the target? The road cuts off here, so we have no choice, I guess. It's your turn. Arm Point! Cloven Roseo! Usopp! Hey, I'm gonna shoot at the target, so unchain me! If you get scared and come back, I'll kill the hostages. It'll be a pain if he brings that dinosaur with him. I know! Usopp! Now's your chance! It's not too far. And there's no wind here in the stomach. I'll hit it right in the middle! Green Star: Skull Bombgrass! What's the matter?! There's a rapidly rising current from the gastric juice below! It gusts up randomly with varying strength. I can't measure the trajectory like this! What's that?! Usopp! Watch out! It's coming at you! Special Attack: Exploding Star! No, no... Cloven Roseo! I'll stall this one! Hurry up and hit the target! That's easy for him to say. There's a random updraft blowing up from the gastric juice! How can I predict it?! Oh, yeah! If I can generate a current that counters the updraft... I can measure the trajectory! Green Star: Skull Bombgrass! Now! He did it! Good job! You guys are very useful "tools"! Are you okay? Whoa, whoa, it's too early to be broken down. I need you to work for me a little bit more. So this is Alchemi. Being dissolved by the gastric juice, it has changed a lot, but I'm sure the mineshaft hasn't changed. The Pure Gold is in there... So are the kidnapped Nami-san and the others... Let's go! This is where you guys are gonna die! The end! It's an ambush! Shoot! Luffy, go ahead! We'll keep them busy! Okay! Gum-Gum Pistol! Old man, lead the way! What's that? "The Final Gate. Those worthy of the bright gold are trusted by others. Unlock the key along with your courageous friends. The treasure lies ahead." This is the last one. What should we do? Seems like we need to unlock the door deep in the alligator's mouth with that key. But there must be some kind of trap. Guys, it's your last job. I need you to go. I knew this would happen! Me too! Nami, hurry up and unlock it! Okay! I don't have time to think this over. What's the matter?! If it's incorrect, the trap will get you! Feels like it got heavier! Hurry up, Nami! Nami-san! There are 17 keyholes left. If I don't pick the right one... Every time we miss, it gets heavier... I'm gonna break! This is exciting! That's a cool trap! 1 out of 15! 1 out of 10! 1 out of 5! Leave it to me! There are two holes that we haven't tried yet. This is our last chance! Left?! Right?! No, I'll take the one on the left! We can't hold out any longer! Are you okay, guys?! Luffy! Gum-Gum... ...Jet Pistol! Boy! After all our pains and troubles... He's done something reckless, as usual! You jerk! What did you do to my friends?! I just used them as tools. Olga! Are you... ...my old man? Olga, you need to get away from here with Luffy-kun and the others. What's this place? Where does it lead to? I don't think we can climb back up, so we should just go forward. This is...! The Pure Gold! So this is the treasure! I can buy the whole world with this! Why is such a valuable thing here? What is this place? It's my crappy old man's lab. But I can't believe he's alive... He said he was having a hard time after being caught by a dinosaur. Does that mean he was in Bonbori-sama's stomach? Yeah. He cried when I told him you were alive. What? This is... What is it? It's Acier-san's research journal. "I decided to make the forbidden Pure Gold. I know that it's wrong as a scientist. But in order to save my daughter from a fatal disease, I'd even sell my soul to the devil." A fatal disease? "I found out the light of the Pure Gold has the effect of... ...suppressing the growth of living things to an extreme extent. I should be able to stop the progression of my daughter's disease by letting her absorb the light." Don't ever take this ring off, okay? So he put the piece of the Pure Gold in that ring to stop the progression of your disease. No... That's why you haven't changed for 200 years. What?! Are you 200 years old?! A grandma? When my mother died, my crappy old man must have suffered too. Despite that, I... Even though he made the Pure Gold to save me... I'm a big fool! Even though he saved my life, I've been holding a 200-year grudge against my father! You're Myskina Acier, aren't you? How dare you do that?! I couldn't help my daughter in any way for two centuries. I finally got my chance to protect her. Even if I'm a worthless man, I'm glad that I'm alive. I thought something like this might happen, so I set explosives to protect my research! Olga. I love you. Everybody, run! My crappy old man must've pushed the self-destruct button! I'll protect Olgal! You bastard! Gum-Gum... ...Balloon! Ow, ow, ow... The Pure Gold?! There it is! Is this the treasure you tried to protect at the cost of your own life?! Old man! The Pure Gold can extend a human life! It's the treasure that the damn Celestial Dragons drool over! Now I, Mad Treasure, have it! I'm sorry, Luffy-kun. By my calculation, I was gonna be buried under the rocks along with him! You can't just die by your own choosing! I've been holding a grudge against you for 200 years! So I need you to stay alive until I can set things right between us! You created the Pure Gold in order to extend my life, didn't you? I didn't know that because you didn't make it clear to me! Crappy old man... Dad! Olga. I'm sorry. What's so funny? What did you say? There's no point in getting a treasure... ...if you cast off your friends! Why are you getting mad, Straw Hat? You can get as many friends as you want with money and power, don't you think? You can just dominate your friends by taking advantage of their greed and fear. Your friends are very handy. After I kill you, I'm gonna reuse them! This is... --What the... --What's going on?! Bonbori-sama is reacting to the light of the Pure Gold! I'll use the power of the Pure Gold and hunt treasures forever! How boring! Your treasure hunting is... ...so boring! Luffy! You can't have my friends! Quit it with that dull crap! Three-Sword Style... ...Dragon Twister! Hey, what's up?! Mad Chain! Second Gear! Hey! Is he gonna be okay?! Luffy's not gonna be dissolved, is he?! We're in danger too! The gastric juice keeps swelling! If nothing is done, we'll be dissolved along with the island! He's here! Iron Pirate... ...General Franky! Hooray! It's a robot! I'm here to save you! I parked the beefed-up Sunny nearby! Now... ...come on board! How can you attack me when I'm camouflaged?! I've been strategizing about the power of invisibility for a long time, so I totally know how those abilities work. Eye, ear, nose, tongue, body. Mind. Those six sense organs can distinguish between... ...good, bad, and neutral! Then, each of those 18 senses are classified into the purified and defiled states! One life, 36 desires! That's enough playing, drunken lady! One-Sword Style... ...36-Pound Phoenix! Sober-up Stimulus Strike! No! How could you be that surprised? Flying slash attacks aren't so rare nowadays. I'm thankful to you. Thankful? I couldn't eat the Clear-Clear Fruit, which allows its user to become invisible, so I buried one of my dreams. But your ability to camouflage... ...opens up new possibilities for me! What are you talking about? A man can't help peeking in women's baths... I mean... ...we can't help having dreams! Have you ever had a dream?! I--- I don't dream! Don't lie! If there is any possibility, people can't help trying it! Blaze up! A boyhood dream! Remember-My-Dream! Women's baths... I mean... ...don't give up your dream! Luffy! It's no fun! It's no fun to get a treasure if you sacrifice your friends! It's meaningless to go on an adventure without your friends! Friends are perfect... ...when you can use and then discard them. I don't care if it's fun or not! This is the way I live! Mad Chain! Gigantea! Straw Hat! I thought you went out to sea because you wanted to get the One Piece! It doesn't matter if you sacrifice your friends. The one who gets a treasure any way he can is the winner! I'm not like you. I'll never cast off my friends. I'll cherish both my dream and my friends! What?! Isn't that too greedy?! Third Gear! Gum-Gum... ...Elephant Gun! It surprisingly took a lot of trouble to bring them down. All right, let's get outta here. Okay! My boss! Your life is more important than the treasure! All treasures in the world are mine! Here we go! The gastric juice is backing up! Isn't it a little too fast?! I think Bonbori-sama's having dry heaves from the impact that Luffy-kun caused! So the way to get out that you were talking about was to make it puke. Yes, that's how I got out. But you caused too much impact! Oh, the uvula! I missed it so much! There's the exit! Make it out in one burst so that we won't be caught up in the puke! You can count on me! Coup de Burst! We got out successfully! Yes! We did! We made it out alive! I've always been dead, though! You should be happy that your bones weren't dissolved! Don't tell me that light is... Yes, that's a giant Pure Gold. What?! Bonbori-sama really likes to eat Pure Gold. And all the Pure Gold that is digested in its stomach builds up in the lamp. "Those who get the Pure Gold will meet with disaster." The "disaster” is actually Bonbori-sama's appetite. Bonbori-sama is swimming away. It'll never appear in front of us again without the Pure Gold. And I'll never create Pure Gold again. This is goodbye to Alchemi. Luffy-kun, everybody... Thank you very much for everything! Thank you. When we were swallowed by Bonbori-sama, she lost her Pure Gold ring. Will she be okay with the disease? That's okay! It'd be so much better... ...to stay out here and die than to go back in there! Olga. What's the name of the disease you have? The South Blue Emperor Fever. It's incurable. What?! That disease has a specific cure already! What? It's not incurable anymore! Are you sure?! It was worth living for 200 years, wasn't it?! If you get this shot, you'll be okay! I--- I don't like those! Hey! No! Stop running! Hey! You're gonna die without it, you know?! Hey, wait! That's great. Both creating the Pure Gold and the last two centuries were... ...worthwhile, after all. Give me your arm! I really hate shots! They're gone now. I actually feel better without those fools! Now, what are we gonna do? We can do whatever we want. I've done everything by myself for two centuries. It's gonna be okay. I can do anything, too, as long as I'm with my beloved daughter. I may be your daughter, but I'm a 206-year old hag! In the end, we couldn't get anything. No, we got something! I found something good! What's that? It's an invitation to Gran Tesoro! A Vivre Card is attached! What's Gran Tesoro?! It's the world's largest entertainment city! There are casinos and luxurious hotels. It's a dream city where celebrities from all over the world gather! Gambling, huh? I bet they have good restaurants. And high-end hotels. I wonder if they have rock shows or something like that. Maybe they have an amusement park! We gotta go there, Luffy! Sounds like fun! Let's go, then! Destination: Gran Tesoro! "Legendary Alchemi Research Lab" "Legendary Alchemi Research Lab" Yes, I'll never forget at any time Yes, I'll never forget at any time If I get to see you again I'll never lose my way and do as my heart tells me I said it to myself over and over again "Legendary Alchemi Weight-Loss Method" "Legendary Alchemi Weight-Loss Method" Even if we're far apart "Legendary Alchemi Weight-Loss Method" "Legendary Alchemi Weight-Loss Method" Even if we're pushed back by headwinds "Legendary Alchemi Weight-Loss Method" "Legendary Alchemi Weight-Loss Method" You just keep looking ahead without turning back You just keep looking ahead without turning back Those eyes that never lose their color are miracle diamonds that started sparkling in your heart My excitement is going out of control and getting entwined I'll never shed tears even when I grow up The future you're imagining is just around the corner Don't look back if that's our destiny Mad Treasure couldn't get the Pure Gold. The Pure Gold vanished into the sea. Should we search for it? No, leave it as it is... ...to maintain the balance of the world. Yes, sir. Anyway, was it that man who was manipulating Mad Treasure behind the scenes? Yes, I think it was... ...Tesoro. Gild Tesoro. What an annoying guy. Mad Treasure has been taken down by someone and he couldn't get the Pure Gold, I heard. I see. I can't believe that the formidable Mad Treasure has been brought down. I'm really surprised. Now that's entertainment! Who did it? Oh, I'm afraid I don't know. Well, forget it. We can just hire somebody else. We have so many ways to enjoy ourselves with the excess amount of gold I have!
