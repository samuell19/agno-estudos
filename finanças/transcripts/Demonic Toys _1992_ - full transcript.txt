I win. I win war. I win. I win. War. And that's where it always ends. That's a pretty weird dream, Jud. I see all sorts of frying possibilities there. Probably some sort of sexual thing, you know? You know, I knew we should have never moved in together. You don't take me seriously anymore. We were right to move in together. And now that you mentioned it, maybe we should, get married. Look, I got nothing against marriage, it's just, you know, we should get married when we're ready to have kids, you know. Do you want kids? I mean, 'cause we never really talked about it or anything. Yeah, sure, someday, you know. Shit. Where are they? Relax, they'll be here. I've been through this a million times. You'll get used to it. They always like to come late, keep the other guy waiting. You know, Matt. Sometimes you don't pick up on things right away. Hey, it'll be okay. This would be a piece of cake. Like now, for instance, I'm trying to tell you something. What? I asked you how you feel about having a kid for a reason. Are you pregnant? I found out this morning. Well, that's great. I'm going to be a dad. Why didn't you tell me this before? You shouldn't be here tonight. Oh shit, here they are. Look, you stay in the car, let me take care of this. Oh, don't be stupid, Matt. You got your piece? Yeah, but I just think it'd be better if you... Then let's dance. [Pause] Cable. Miss me? Oh, yeah, I like you with a fire that burns. He's been my loins. Me too. It must be love. Who's the femme? That's my investor. I'll take a bite. Fuck you. Meow. Are you going to show us something? Are you going to stand here and jerk us off all night? Hey, Hesse, I love this guy, I really do. Yeah, I'm going to show you something. Come on. Knock off some Indonesia, the good stuff. Single action. You mean just for rear sight? The one at stock and best of all, no serial numbers. Clean as a whistle or a baby's bottom. Knock it off, Lincoln. [Pause] Whatever floats your boat. We got these babies out of Russia. Sell a lot to the cartels. Bang-bang, Juno. Hey. No clip, man. All right. How much? 40 K for the whole lot. What do you say? I say, you're under arrest. Matt. Matt. Oh, shit. Oh, baby, no. No. Oh, god. You bastards. God damn you. My god, I'm hit. Lincoln, Lincoln. Lincoln. Lincoln, I'm hit. Lincoln! Sorry, Guy. Lincoln, help me. Now you have almost enough. Well that would be Charnetski. How do you know? He always orders at this time. Let me have it. Thanks for calling Country Chicken, the best chicken in town, your order please? Get off the phone hammerhead and let me talk to Mark. It's for you. [Pause] What's up, Charnetski? The regular. Legs and breast and none of that wing shit. And bring me plenty of honey for my fucking movies time. You assholes always skip on that. Would you like that extra crispy or chunk style? Take a guess. The chunk style. That's my boy. Now, get off your fucking ass and bring me my food. You got it. Mr. Wayne. Mr. Wayne. Is that cigarette in your mouth? No. It's your dick. [inaudible] out please, this instant. [Pause] I don't think I like your attitude, mister. Well, I guess that makes two of us. You're being verbally abusive to me, Mr. Peterson. Where do you think you're going? I'm going to deliver Charnetski his food. Fuck you about your attitude, it is not acceptable. Now, I want you to make sure you come right out back here, mister. Well, maybe I won't come back. Maybe I'll just fly your fucking chicken mobile into the river. How do you like that? No, man, what is wrong? Fucking toys. You're under arrest asshole. So you're cops, huh? Well, I guess I know that your partner, going out there, didn't I? Shut up. It's okay. It's okay 'cause I'm going to be out on bail by the end of the night bitch. This whole fucking thing is entrapment. Hi Guy. Thanks for coming. I've been sleeping for a long time. Waiting for someone just like you to wake me. We're going to have a lot of fun here tonight, friend. We're going to raise hell. What the fuck was that? And your partner? How the fuck should I know, Miss Cop? Shit! Shit! What's going on, lady? We're locked in. What! Fucking brilliant! Fucking brilliant lady, what are we going to do now? We wait until morning. Wait? No, no, no, fuck that police lady, you get me the fuck out of here now! Now! 'Cause I got my rights, lady! You got to take me in the county. I got to make a phone call. I got to talk to my fucking lawyer! You don't get shit, you killed my partner. You're lucky I don't put a bullet in your fucking head and call it self-defense. Is that you, kid? No, it's the Hillside Strangler, let me in. Hold your pants on. Hey! Hey you, up here! [Glass breaking] Hey you, up here! Hey! Hey! Hey, up here! You're a fucking genius, lady, a lot of good that did. Now, there you are, it took you long enough. Yeah, it took me the same amount of time it takes me every night. Here you go, twelve o'clock, right on the dot. You want a beer, kid? Take a guess. Thanks. Hey, did you see Miss July? Not yet. Wrap your eyeballs around them. Ooh wow! It sort of brings a tear to your eye, though. Yeah and something else. You God damn, I need them, son of a bitches! Look kid, how is work? Ugh. It's a fucking a joke, chunking chicken Christ. Peterson runs around like he's got a board shoved up his ass all the time. Well, what do I tell you? The world is your twin and all the people in it are assholes. God damn economy. Here's what you do. You can do like I do. Find yourself a niche. Break yourself in. Take my gun. I mean I sit on my ass, watch television. Take a little hair off your pooch. That's a life. Take this iguana guy for instance... Iguana? Yeah, this guy who's down the Costa Rica. Starts raising the little bastards. Once you take up the space. And it tastes just like chicken. Everything tastes just like chicken, you ever noticed that? Frog legs, snakes, even rabbits tastes like chicken. Everything except this shit. We're fucked, lady. Nobody knows we're up here, nobody is going to hear us up here. No, no, no. Did you hear that? What? Somebody ought to hear that. Maybe I better go out and check, huh? You are the security guard. Yeah but it could be a cat or something, right? Could be. Yeah, it could be. I'm going to tell you something. If it's a bum, I'm going to kick his goddamn ass. There ain't nothing in this place to steal except some goddamn old toys. You stay here, kid. Well, wait a minute. What if someone comes back here when you're gone? There is an old shotgun there in the locker. I'll take my chances with you. Your choice kid, ain't close. Anybody there? I don't think there's anything here. I've sworn I heard something, I don't know. I don't know. It's the storage room. Anybody? Open up! Open the door. Who the hell is in there? I'm a cop. Open the door. Oh yeah? Let me see some identification. You happy? Open the door. Yeah, hold your pants on. What the hell are you doing in there? The doors went shut and locked us in. Didn't you hear screaming and gunshots? Yeah. Look, I chased two men into your warehouse. One of them is wounded, maybe dead. The other one's handcuffed back here. Holy Christ! What the fuck are you looking at? What the hell did he do? He killed my partner. No shit! Look, I'm going to need a phone to call for backup. No, it's dead. I tried it. No sweat, we'll use the one in my office. Look, you got to have to do it for me, I... I can't leave him. What about the other guy, he's still out there, right? Yeah, but he's hurt badly. Look, call the Jackson Precinct all right? My name is Gray, tell them there's an officer down. Let them know that it's a code thirty, all right? Right. You know how to use that gun? I was in Korea. Lady, I can handle myself. Christ! What a night. Here. Close the door and don't open it until I get back. You stay there and keep watch. Sure. If you move at all, I'll kill you. Those two clowns are going to be a lot of help, bitch! He tripped. What? He's getting up. I'm okay. He's all right, probably a little drunk. Hi, you bad fuck. I'm Baby Oopsy Daisy. You lordass, will you be my special friend? What the hell? I can walk, I can talk. I can even shit my pants. Huh? Can you shit your pants? Playtime! Oh my God, somebody shot him. Get back. You son of a bitch, you shot my leg. Oopsy-Daisy. Pops goes the fucking weasel. Get out of here. Look out! Get the gun. Watch the door. Get up! Get up! Bitch! No! Charnetski! Oops! [Screaming] Charnetski, the toys. Holy Shit! Lock it! Get me the fuck out of here. Shit! Lock it! Jesus Christ lady, I'm talking, God damn it! You're heavy you Moby fucking Dick! Somebody want to tell me what the fuck is going on here? It's the toys. Someone is inside the toys. Who are you? My name's Anne. How did you get in here? Through there. I've been sleeping here the last couple of nights. Runaway. Yeah, I guess you could say that. I got a dad who likes to use me for batting practice. Yeah. Well, how come you didn't come out until now? I've been watching you. Look, things got kind of weird around here. I figured my chances are better off if I hung out with you. Nice outfit. Polyester looks really good with leather. Very funny. Do you have any idea what's going on out there? It's the toys. They're alive. Toys? Toys! Did you see what they did to Charnetski? Jesus Christ! Like son of a barn! Quiet! We got to get out of here! This is fucked! We got to get out! Shut up! Aw! You're not helping things, all right? Okay. Now, the toys have not come to life. The fucking teddy bear looked pretty alive to me. You saw it. They're all over the warehouse. They're locking us in. There has to be another explanation. Like what? I don't know. [Laughter] Lady, you are some kind of a cop. Let me tell you. Peter, you know what this place is. Yeah. Yeah, it's a warehouse for overstocked toys, shit like that. Well, you were friends with the night watcher, you must know where the exits are. It wouldn't matter. This place is chained tight until the morning. The only way out is through the loading doors, they're open in the office. Okay, okay, he shot... He shot the locks of one of those chains, we can go out that exit. The one on the north end? They blocked that off after you came through. That's when I first saw them. They're evil spirits, you know. I don't believe in evil spirits. Well, you better. This place is haunted. The spirits are inside the toys. Damn it, I don't believe any of this shit! God. What's the matter? The floor. You see. What do you want? [Music] Who do you want dead? This isn't funny anymore guys. [Laughter] [Screaming] Are we having fun yet? I need your bodies. I need flesh and blood. Stop it! Peel off your skin. Chew up your bones. Stop it! War. And I need you most of all to [inaudible]. And I need you most of all to [inaudible]. Did you see him? That's the little boy I've been dreaming about. Look! Look, we've got to get out of here. It's that simple, I can't handle this ghost shit. All right! Okay, all right. All right, we can... we can get to the security office right? Can you get the loading doors open? Yeah but how are we supposed to get there? Can you get there to those air conditioning shafts? Yeah, I can find a way. All right, then the two of you will have to go and get out there and bring help. So why don't you come with us? >. I can't. I have to bring him in. Why? Because it's my job. Yeah but I'm not too crazy about this idea. See, I've got to sing about falling around in small dark places, especially with those things out there. Well, I can't leave him here. [Pause] Come on. What are you, chicken? Hey. Don't ever mention the word chicken to me again. [Pause] Are you coming? I've heard a snake or something. Just keep moving. What the hell was he talking about back there anyway? There's demonic power here, I can feel it. It must be some sort of satanic ritual or something. It must be trying to conjure something up. [Pause] All I need is human blood or something like that. Great. Sorry, I asked. I bet you're sorry you ran away, huh? They don't care about me. They never cared anything about me. But let's go. Judith. Oh, Judith. Judith. Over here Judith. In here. In here Judith. In here. That's right. In here, Judith. Hello Judith. Where are we? Inside the doll's house. It's part of the astral play. This is where I live for the time being. This isn't real. This is isn't real. It's real enough. [Pause] I brought you here so we can have a chat. Who are you? A spirit. Just like your little prince said, a bad one too. You look like a little boy to me. Oh? I could take any form I want to. I could be this. [Growling & Laughter] Oh, no. [Crying and Laughter] But I like this form best of all. Don't you? Oh, God! God has nothing to do with this Judith. Actually, let's scratch the word God from our Lexicon all together. Let's talk demons instead. That's fucking longer. Were on this then. Can you see? What the hell are they? They're some kind of watch dogs. They're not real, they're not like the toys there. They're like some kind of hallucination you know. They can't hurt you. How do you know? I already met one earlier. It hit me and it just disappeared. Oh shit! They've seen us. [Noise] We're not part of your physical world. We feed off your fear, your pain, your deaths. But that's not enough to satisfy me. You know what I really want Judith? A body to hang my soul in, a real body, blood and bones. What are you talking about? Right now, I'm weak. My spirit is bound by the walls of this warehouse. It's taken all my strength just to animate these toys. Even that took 66 years of rest. 66 years since the last time I tried to be born. Push harder, come on. Easy, okay, that's right dear. It's all right. You're going to be all right. [Pause] Oh, he's not going to make it. Such a beautiful child. It's no use, he's dead. Better luck next time little friend. Perhaps we'll meet another time. Don't blame yourself dear. You did the best you could. I'll see who it is. Trick or treat. Goodness! What wonderful costumes, darling, see? No. Would you like something better than candy? Yeah. Good, I have a very special surprise for you. Now, he is like a seed and you must plant him and take very good care of him, do you understand? Yes. Come, dear. Now, that way, he will grow big and strong and when he's ready, he will find a little baby to grow inside of. And then he can finally be born. Thank you. I've been imprisoned in that corpse for 66 years, waiting for something to set me free. Your friend's blood did the trick. You see, in order for me to take on a human form. I have to be born like human. At the moment of birth, I ride shotgun down the old birth canal. And I come out instead, Judith or should I call you Mom? What the hell are you talking about? You know. Have you forgotten so soon? What? You're pregnant, 31 days to be exact. That's why I've lured you here. Oh no. I'm going to be a dad, Jud. We should have never moved in together. You just don't take me seriously anymore. Oh Matt. Oh baby, help me. [Crying & Laughter] Even now, I'm taking care of your friends in the air conditioning shafts. After I'm done with them... No! Then they'll come for you. Then we could do the next thing. No! No! Don't worry Judith, the pain won't last long. I'll speed up the birth. You can be the proud mother of a brand new demon by sunrise. No! Then blood's really going to run. [Noise] [Music & Noise] [Singing] Mercy do-si do-si Dons sit there around the ivy. Oh fuck Mercy Dons. I like you, will you be my special friend? Playtime! .9 Bummer! [Music & Noise] No! [Noise] [Music & Noise] Fuck you, you little shit! [Music & Noise] Come on! [Noise] Look out! [Noise] Hey! You're fucking up my make up. You're getting me hot, you brat [laughter]. Oh man! Telephone, the phone. Oh fuck, it's dead. We're trapped, what the fuck are we going to do? Oh God! Oh my God! A gun. Charnetski's got a shotgun in the closet. Hurry, come on. I'm hurrying! It's okay, it's over. No, it's not. It's not over. Shit! Don't look now. Anne! Oopsy Daisy! Missed me. God. Give it up, Mark. Each death just makes me stronger. I'm a demon kid, it's my specialty. How do you want your death served up to you? You want that chunk style or extra crispy? Everything you've seen up to now has only been a warm up. Wait till I really get rolling. Hello Mark! No Mark. You're not shy are you? It sort of brings a tear to your eye, don't it? Are we having fun yet? It's not real! Oh god! I'll take that. You know, I was just saying to myself, Lincoln old boy. You need yourself a gun and look at what happens. Mister fast food king himself comes strolling around the corner with the answer to my prayers. How did... How? I played the old Houdini act on your lady friend back there, chicken boy. Yeah! Now, it's time to take care of you, little buddy. Wait a minute man. We got to stick together, those things are everywhere. I'm just doing what the voices inside my head tell me to do kid. So they say "Blow your fucking brains out." I'll blow your fucking brains out! Nothing personal, you understand? I just haven't been myself lately. [Singing] Kill me 92. Just when things were getting interesting. [Pause] Are you okay? But you said you want to bring him in alive? I lied. [Singing] Who is a little child there box? One with all the golden mom. You shut the fuck up! I'm getting sick of this in a major fucking way! Come on, we got to get out of here. Where's Anne? Dead. She, she got nailed in the office. Okay. It's just the two of us, let's do it. The toys got into the loading door controls. There's no way out of here until the morning. Well, we can't wait until the morning. That thing's getting stronger by the minute. I don't understand what the hell that thing wants from us. My baby. What? I'm pregnant. This thing came to me in my mind and told me what he wanted. He wants to take over my unborn child. And why the hell does he need the rest of us? Because these deaths makes him more powerful. Well that's great. That's just fucking perfect. I have to get my head blown off by some junior demon is a fucking hard off for you. It's not my fault. But maybe I could just save him the trouble and kill myself. Why don't you? Shut the fuck up! I wasn't talking to you, motherfucker! Let's get out of here. Almost time. Charge! Shit! You got me. Fuck! I'm dying. Pull! [Gunshot] You're fucking dead. You can't kill me. Oh, give me a break. I can't believe it. Mother of Satan, could this be the fucking end of Baby Oopsy Daisy? So fucking watch. Jesus Christ. Oh my god! No! I win. I win. War. War. War. Hi Jud. You know I only have eyes for you. No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! Matt. Hello Judith, don't cry, you could make it. You know, it just wouldn't be a show without you. Oh, God! Help me! This isn't so bad, is it? No, please, no! [Music] My dear friend Mr. Cable was nice enough to tie you up. Or should I call him dad? All right. You little shit! I've had enough of this. Now, let the lady go. Hi Mark. Thanks for coming. [Growling] Where was I? Oh yes. Let me slip into something a little more comfortable before the fun begins. There. That's much better. No! Relax. I'm going to make you give birth to me Judith. You might even enjoy this. First, I'm going to crawl on top of you and do the nesting. Then, I'll be inside your womb. I'm going to eat the soul of your baby and take his shell for my own. Then I'll induce labor. Before the night is through, I'll be born in a human body, flesh and blood. No! Such a pretty mother you're going to make. I've waited 66 years for this, trapped in the earth on this very spot. No, no, no! Don't worry you pretty little head, it'll all be over soon. You won't survive the birth of course. No! I can assure you of that. [Music & Crying] Come on, start. [Noise] [Crying] [Noise] You! No. That's impossible! [Engine Screeching] Here I come, you motherfucker! [Engine Screeching] No! No! Get away from her. Ace tops king. I win. It's okay now, mom. Everything is okay. We won. Who are you? I'm your son. The son you're going to have. The demon has gone back to hell. Maybe he'll try to steal another baby's soul. I don't understand. I'm a spirit too. Since I haven't been born yet, not for another eight months. But I couldn't let him kill you, mom. I didn't want to grow up to be evil. So I found a way to hell. So I became a toy soldier. What's your name? You haven't given me one yet. I have to go now mom. But I'll see you soon. Bye mom. It's over, isn't it? Who were you talking to? My little boy. My little boy.
