[numerous footfalls] [numerous footfalls] [men shouting] [Schwarzhuber] This is what happens to those who try to escape from my camp! HOORAY! I AM BACK! [gasping] [distant clanging] [loud metal clanging] [guard] Get up! Get up! Get up! Come on, everyone! Get up, quick! [loud clanging continuous] SCRIBE [distant train whistle] [guard shouting orders] [indistinct shouting] [door opens] Judging by your number, you've been here about a week? [door closes] Sorry, I don't understand. How long have you been here, a week? Where's your bowl? -Stolen. -How long since you last ate? Three days. The block inspector won't give me food unless I have a bowl. Wash with tea. You'll get typhus from the water. And shave daily. Get something sharp. You'll look healthier with red cheeks. Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come, thy will be done... -There are two more inside. -Let me note down their numbers first. [distant guard shouting] Herszek! Are all the jobs filled? I have 300 volunteers and only 150 available spots. [indistinct chattering] [band playing upbeat music] [whistle blows] [officer] Let's go! [door opens and closes] [secretary] Name. Name! [loud clang] -Slovak? Name. -Alfred Wetzler. -Occupation? -I used to be a woodworker. [Lausmann] Shalom, Jews! First order of business: Forget your names. Names are ballast. Numbers are exact. Unmistakable. You Jews know a little something about numbers, don't you? [loud metallic clanging] The German Reich is built on rules and order. And so it will remain for the next thousand years. You have come here to serve the Reich... [indistinct chattering] [loud metallic clanging continuous] [Lausmann] Welcome to Auschwitz! [coughing] [dog barking] [Valér] Prisoner 44070, sir! [guard barks command] Prisoner 20962. Barrack 9. I'm reporting in for work. [officer] Down on the ground! Up! Down! Up! Down! Up! -What was that? -He was messing with me. Here, grab it. [officers shouting] What took you so long? [panting] -Hang in there. -Don't worry about us. We're dead already. You just worry about the living. [whistling] [Adamek] Good luck! [Freddy] Here goes the usual farce. [door opens] -Valér, what took you so long? -I came as soon as I could. Everyone's got the cold sweats because of the inspection. Got some gold from the girls at Canada. I'll swap it for the watches. -These are the numbers for January. -Yesterday's transport is missing. I haven't got to the Sonderkommando. They're still sleeping. They must've blown that whole transport through the chimneys. This is from the canisters they throw in. It wouldn't peel off completely, so I drew the rest of it. Valér, what number is this? -Where did you leave off? -Here. January 28: 3000 French, 600 Dutch, 2000 Polish. Got it? January so far: 93400. -Got it? -Yeah. [upbeat music playing] [Valér] That's 3012 every day. 25 every hour. 2 every minute. [Adamek] You must get this evidence to important people back in Slovakia. The important people will send planes. And these planes will blast this place into oblivion. So that nothing remains but ash. Ash and smoke. Good. What's up with barrack 9? Do I have to count you myself? [breathing heavily] [Schwarzhuber] What's the hold-up with barrack 9? Someone's missing! Everything was fine when we were leaving the barrack. Move it! [Lausmann] Herr Lagerführer, a prisoner is missing from the quarantine block B-II A. What do you mean he's missing? He's lying somewhere face down in the dirt. Keep searching. [Kaduk] Keep searching! Quarantine block! Move it! Herr Lagerführer, a prisoner is missing from barrack 9. [sniffles] [dogs barking] [sirens wailing] [dogs barking] [Kaduk] Two scribes are missing. 29162 and 44070. Slovaks. Who has seen the barrack scribe today? Who saw him run off? Block inspector! -Prisoner number 2043... -Huh? Prisoner number 20432! I know nothing. Please, believe me! I last saw him this morning. He got up early, as usual. He took his death book and went to the washroom. That's all I know, I swear. Please, believe me. I swear... The best way to find truffles is to starve the pig. Until I see those two Jews sitting here with the signs around their necks, you'll be sitting here yourselves. Do you understand? Search all the barracks in this block. If you don't find them, send back all the barracks except for 9. Get going! [Kaduk] Right! We'll start with 25 lashes. Then we will see what else he remembers. No, please... I know nothing. Please, believe me! I know nothing. Please! No, please. No... [loud blows landing] [grunting] [panting] Damn Eastern Front. 'For the Fatherland!' What horseshit! He fell yesterday. My only son. Twenty-one years old. This whole affair is making my stomach turn. You, the camp, the whole damn country! Here. See? How handsome he was! Look. Look at him! My poor wife... [horse neighs] [man screams in distance] God damn it! Shit! Fucking mess... How long have the prisoners been here? Since summer 1942. [sighs] Shit. They've seen more than you, Kaduk. Do you understand? They must not pass. Do you understand? -[snaps heels] -Go! [huffs] Swap with me. Got it from the kitchen before the roundup. Pass it around. -[dogs barking] -[distant officer shouting] [gasps] [distant officer shouting] [panting and sniffing] -[officers shouting] -[dogs barking] [sobbing softly] Come here. Sit down. Uh-uh. Here. Ten times I thought about killing you last night. Ten times. I was keeping track. See? Because you helped someone back on his feet... Because you were passing around the bread of life... Stuffing your guts... It was my fault alone. In German we would call it service. Verdienst. You're a good person, right? -You used to be a Franciscan. -I still am. When you were feeding your friends, I had to think of my dead boy. I felt like sending three bullets through your stomach. Do you know why I didn't? How did those two escape? You think you're going to make it, but you're wrong. They're already dead, they just don't know it yet. I'll have them on the chairs by this evening. The locals will give them up, and if they don't, they'll just keep running until they drop face first in shit. Death comes first for those who stand in place. Whatever. I know they had help. And you enjoy helping people. That's why two people are going to die today. That's the only bread you'll be giving out from now on. [distant clanging] But you can save them. [all shouting] [screaming] [distant siren wailing] [gunshots] [all screaming] [gunshot] -[gunfire continuous] -[whimpering] [gunshot] [distant officers shouting] [panicked screaming] [dogs barking] [muffled sobs] [breathing heavily] [Lausmann] Give me one thing and you can go in the barrack. You're willing to put yourselves through all this for two Slovak Jews? [gate creaks open] [officers shouting] [gate closes] Your daughter is over in the women's section, right? What? You thought I didn't know? [women sobbing] You think I don't know what goes on in your chicken brains? Ester... Ester! Let me go. Let me go! You're not going to help her like this. [wheezes] [girl] Please, no! [gunshot] [Kaczmarek hyperventilating] She spoke Slovak, not Polish! Didn't you hear her scream? [panting] It doesn't matter. That girl was Slovak! She couldn't have been your daughter! If they bought the other girl here, his daughter's already dead. [laughing softly] [coughs] [whistle blows] [officer barks orders in distance] [feet marching] -[classical music plays] -[whistle blows] [coughs] [spits] Send barrack 9 back to work! [whistle blows] -[Schreiber] Go, go! Move it! -Get in line! Get going! Move it! Move it! Move it! Move it! [classical music playing faintly] [brakes squeal] [loud thumping overhead] [officer] Move it! Move it! [overhead thumping continuous] [shushing] [whispering inaudibly] [heavy dragging overhead] What are we waiting for? We'll go out one by one or all at once, what's the difference? There's more of us. We'll take out three of those bastards, if we spare the dogs. [Pavel] Hold on. When he lights up. [lighter scratching] Hold on. Piece of shit! [gate creaks open] [dogs barking] -[gates close] -[vehicle door slams] [Kaduk] Move! Be quick about it! Los! [siren wails] You owe me ten cigarettes. [grunts] -[both panting] -Push! [both grunting] [Kaduk] Withdraw the outer guard belt! [siren wails] Columns of five! [grunting] [breathing heavily] What are you doing this for? You think you're proving something here? To whom? Me? Yourselves? Even an ape can stand on its two feet! [laughs] Did I say something funny? Funny? Absolutely not. -No? -No. -You having a laugh? -No. No. No... -Do you find me funny? -He was castrated by Dr Thilo. Was I talking to you? I see that morale is going down the shitter. You need to be reminded where the dog kennels are. Come here. Come. Los! Move it! Round the barrack. Walk! Stop! [panting softly] Turn around. I said turn around! Are you going to beg? I will mention this in my memoirs, which I'm going to write after the war at my farm somewhere by the Black Sea. What about you, funny guy? Where do you think you're going to be? Where? Behind every corner, in every shadow, always near. [gunshot] [breathing heavily] Shit! Fuck! Go back! Get back in the barrack! Send for the driver. I need a lighter! [both grunting] Push! Push! [wood creaking] [Valér] Does it look like I'm holding back? [both panting] It won't budge. It won't budge... I'm not going to die here! I'm not going to fucking die here! [door thumps] [both panting softly] [distant metal clanging] They've pulled the guards. Come. [Valér] No more fences. [sobbing softly] [muffled laughter] [laughs] [panting] [breathing heavily] [Valér] Potatoes... Potatoes with sauerkraut. [groans] [coughs] Must've been the berries. Valér! Valér! Valér! -[distant officer shouting] -[dogs barking] [Freddy] We're about two, three days away from the border. If we go straight. If we go around, it'll be two or three more. Thanks for the shoe. [distant animal calling] [sighs] -What's wrong? -The other tube. I must've dropped it. [Freddy] I lost it. You're going to the border, right? It's not far. But it's quite a hike even with healthy feet. [woman] That's them. Here. Our guys got them off some Germans. They had no use for them anymore. My brother-in-law. Eat. He knows his way around these parts. He can take you across. [sniffles] That won't do. [blow lands] Don't limp. Your body needs to get used to the pain. -[blow lands] -Straighten up. -[blow lands] -Good. Keep up. [panting] [panting] Do you want to go now or after sundown? They'll have processed three transports before sundown. [wind gusting] [breathing heavily] [gasping and panting] [distant indistinct chatter] [both panting] Freddy! Freddy, get up! [wheezing breaths] [distant clatter] [utensils clatter] -Good morning. -Easy, boy. Come get some breakfast. Thank you. Here, have some. [pounding on door] [door opens] [door closes] -Praise the Lord. -Amen. He's one of us. You couldn't ask for better cover. Take care. And good luck in Žilina. [children laughing] [door unlocks] [door creaks open] [man] Come. Welcome, gentlemen. Alas, Mr Warren from the Red Cross couldn't make it today. Hopefully tomorrow. In the meantime, we'll question you ourselves. A lot has been said about the camps. I'm glad you'll finally be able to shed some light on all the 'rumours'. Thank you. Well, was it hard to get out of Auschwitz? I don't know... What do you expect us to do? I thought you were the resistance. If you're asking us what to do, then we've come to the wrong place. You need to understand, we don't have that kind of clout. -We're just... -Wait until tomorrow. If you want to get this to someone important, you need to convince Warren. But... There is one way we can help you. [typewriter dings] [dings] [typewriter clacking] [vehicle approaches] [Valér] You're late! Two days, six hours, fifteen minutes. Can you imagine how many lives that costs in Auschwitz? Do you realise the trouble we had to go through... [Freddy] 27,125. I counted it for you. A medium coffee with cream. Three sugars? -Yes, yes, yes. -Thank you. Ah, yes, these are for our friends here. What is that? Go on. Don't be shy. [door slams] Humanitarian aid... that Red Cross sends to all the German internment camps. You should recognize it. We've sent over 400,000 of these to Auschwitz alone. That's approximately... 2,000 tons of medicines, clothes, food... That no prisoner has ever seen. Have you even read the report? Well, I thumbed it over on my way from the airport. In the report you state that the people of the Theresienstadt transport were gassed. On March 8th, 4:30 a.m. It was 3,800 people. Most of them children. [sighs] This is cards... letters... written by dozens of people from that transport. They were sent to their relatives several weeks after the authors had allegedly been gassed in some kind of showers. Please excuse me if I didn't get the wording right. We all had to write postcards and letters like that. And the SS guards would then fill in the date and send them later. Even the people who were about to get gassed had to write them. And as far as I know, the post office is controlled by the occupation government. 'Don't worry, we are fine. We haven't been assigned a workplace yet, but we'll get work in our field of expertise. We'll be leaving in a few days. We are together. The children are all right. I hope to see you soon'. Should I go on? You can clear these. [door opens and closes] Let me tell you my dilemma. On the one hand, there are sources like Dr Grawitz... a well-respected colleague friend of mine from the German Red Cross. And then there's you: two young men... motivated by... resentment over being resettled. We need evidence. There's your evidence. See? March 23: a thousand Jewish girls from Slovakia. March 30: 1,112 people from Paris. August 15 to 17: 8,000 Jews from Sosnowiec. All of them gassed. And even the Germans confirmed that on March 8th, 1944, there was 3,800 people in Theresienstadt. By the previous October, when they arrived, there was 5,007 of them. So, what happened in the intervening time period? Or do you think that 1,207 people dying in five months' time is a normal mortality rate? It's true that the camps were battling a typhoid epidemic, but it was the German Red Cross who helped prevent further casualties. And your friend Grawitz told you this, right? Because he's a Nazi. If he wasn't, he wouldn't have such high office. You are sending milk, and prisoners there are drinking dysenteric water. You are sending your soap, and they are showering with Zyklon B. Your aid hasn't saved a single life. Not even of the fleas devouring the clothes and the bodies and the skin of all the people who are still in there. You've seen this before, haven't you? Zyklon B. You know what it is, right? [clears throat] How credible do you think is the information contained in these reports? Some of the reports were put together by the men, the Sonderkommando. They work at the furnaces. And some of it comes from the camps' registry books. But they only detail the big transports, the larger transports. About a year ago, we gained the assent of Dr Goebbels. We dispatched several observation committees to the camps. They were supposed to report on whether the unusually high mortality rate coming from foreign press were based in truth. They found nothing. And this was around the end of 1943? Because on that day, I remember everything in Auschwitz seemed perfectly normal. And even the furnaces were on cooldown. But over at Birkenau, people were being gassed as usual. Are you saying that they-- that they arrived? They haven't come back, did they? We were informed by German Red Cross that they had... perished in a car accident. No, no, the camp administrators, they made sure that they only saw what they wanted them to see. And I don't know if they-- If they met the prisoner who told them about Birkenau, or they just wanted to see for themselves, but they were killed there on that day. And I can tell that the men from the Sonderkommando in the furnaces, they knew who are dead, throwing into the fire. How many Jews have they killed? [Freddy] In Auschwitz, one and a half million. But it's not just about Jews. The camps are for everyone who they consider an enemy. The Slavs, the Roma people, and now it's the Hungarians' turn. How do you know? [Freddy] Because they didn't keep it a secret. Right now they are finishing the construction of a new train track that will lead directly into the furnaces. And the SS guards are joking, and they are anticipating the famous Hungarian sausages they can eat. I know the burden. We carried it with us all the way here. But the question is, the important thing is, what are you going to do about it? Is... Is possible that the Allies don't know about this? [Freddy] They might have suspicion, but they certainly don't know the details. I'll try. I'll... try to get this to the Americans. Try to... to convince them to negotiate. [Freddy] No! Don't negotiate with killers. Fill your planes with bombs and destroy the place. Even the prisoners, they want nothing more than to see a rain of fire falling from the sky, destroying the towers, the fences. Destroy it all. [officer] Right. Left. Right. Left. Right... Right. Left. Left. Left. Right. Right. Left. Left. Left. Right. Left. Right. Right. Right. Left. Well, well! The man of faith! I've heard a lot about you. Herr Lausmann sends his cordial regards from Berlin. Left! Left. -Left. Left. Left. -[prisoner] No, please. I'm fine, please. Los! Move it, you swine! Move it, quick! [distant dogs barking] [breathing heavily] [heavy breathing continuous] [man 1] The historical evidence is strongly against-- is-- is hugely against six million Jews having been deliberately gassed in gas chambers as a deliberate policy of Adolf Hitler. I believe there were no gas chambers. [man 2] We are becoming a colony of Zionism, where we, the local people, play the role of mere spectators. [man 3] We won't be fooled by Jewish and Zionist lies about the 'evil' wartime Slovak state and about the 'democracy' -we have today. -[crowd booing] [man 4] Your neighbourhood, your village, your children's school, your life, salary will be irreversibly impacted by immigration. As president, I will restore the borders on my first day in office. [crowd cheering] [man 5] When I take office, the Gypsy question will be resolved in a year and a day. The term itself will vanish from the Prešov region. The Gypsy question will be no more. [Donald Trump] So some are good, and some are rapists, and some are killers, and we don't even know what we're getting. And they're not just coming from Mexico, they're coming from all over, so certainly you know that's true... [man 6] Whereas the Moroccan scum in Holland-- and, once again, not all are scum, but there is a lot of Moroccan scum in Holland who makes the streets unsafe. [man 7] I wish all of you here in Žilina a pleasant, white day. [crowd applauds] [man 8] Thankfully, the Red Pestilence no longer treads our lands. That, however, does not mean that it was not replaced by a new plague, which now tries to subdue our hearts, minds, and souls. It is not red, but the colour of rainbow. [man 9] Who would love homosexuals? No one, okay? No one. [man 10] I believe that they should be executed by the government which, by the way, in 79 countries in this world, homosexuality is still illegal, and in many places it does carry the death penalty. [man 11] Once I succeed, I will stop the financing of NGOs. These useless people will have to start working... [crowd applauds] [man 12] The leaders of the European Left area all talk. Blah, blah, blah! Generosity, solidarity, hospitality... And the Italians are evil, racist, ignorant, egotistical fascists, Nazis... [man 13] They're coming over here. They're taking over. But they not renting it back to us. See, they kicking us out. And I don't want to go back to World War II and Hitler and all that. [overlapping voices] [man 14] I want to tell you one more thing I know about the nigger. And I've often wondered, are they better off as slaves? [overlapping voices] [man 15] We cannot allow that Germans become the minority in Germany. That is the essential thing! [applause]
