The house is sold out, my lord. No further incidents, I trust? No, nothing. Everything seems quite normal. From his Lordship, Madam. Is this all? Yes, Madam. Last time there were diamonds. Put them with the others, Teresa. Teresa, is that you? Teresa, come and help me button my dress. What is it now? It's Maria. She said she's seen something. Leave me alone. Go away. Maria. Harry. Harry. It was here, in the room. It was terrible. Now, Maria... "Now, Maria," nothing. I saw him, I tell you. Standing just over here. Just here. Black. All over, black. And his eye, staring at me. His eye? Eye. One eye in the mile of his forehead. And his face, Harry. It was horrible. Maria, I'm sure you saw something. Exactly what it was... It was him. After the show, we'll try and find out. Harry, I can't go on tonight. Of course you can. You're an artist. You're not going to let a little thing like a ghost upset you. So, you do believe me? Of course, I believe you. After the show, I promise we'll find out all about it. Now you lie down and have a little rest. You're so good for me. Five minutes, please. Put your feet up for a minute or two. I'll come and see you before you go on. Oh, Harry. I'll send Teresa. Now, shut your eyes and rest. Teresa. Stay with her, won't you. Is she all right? Yes. She saw something, Bill. My music, Mr. Hunter. Some of my music is missing. You don't need it, Rossi. You know it backwards. I know, but who could have done such a thing? Someone's playing a joke. We've had too many jokes. He's right. Come on now. This is a first night, not a funeral. Thank you. Thank you, Bill. All right, Lattimer, it's only me. I thought it was Lord d'Arcy. He'll come in late, you know that. On the first night of his own opera? All the more reason for making a good entrance. I don't understand it. I really don't understand it. Don't you? I understand it all right. What I don't understand is how Ambrose d'Arcy... can write so much excellent music in the last few years... when he has so little musical taste. Thank you, Mr. Hunter. You're welcome. A full house, my lord. So you keep telling me. They seem to sense good music, don't they? Yes. They like a good tune. If he wasn't the best producer in London... I'm quite sure he meant no disrespect, my lord. D Silence d d Silence. Silence. Silence d d These Englishmen they have the manners of the pigs d d And no sense of decency d d Silence d d Silence d d By order of the town Burgher d d By order of the town Burgher d d Who speaks in the name d d Of the Earl of Warwick d d Who speaks in the name of the Earl of Warwick d d Seize him d d Seize him d d You lousy Frenchie d d You think this is a joke d d I'll tell you something now d d To take your smile away d d From this day forward there is to be d d An increase in the taxes d I thought you said the house was sold out. So it is, my lord. Then why is that box empty over there? There have been complaints, my lord. Complaints? Complaints of what? Of noises, my lord. What? Voices. People do not like to sit there, my lord. Are you trying to tell me it's haunted? D And the penalty of death d That is what they say, my lord. Oh no, this is too much. I shall speak to your directors in the morning. A perfectly good box going to waste. D In the sound of rain d d As thunder grows distant d d From darkest night d d To broadest d d day d d I hear your voice d d In summer sunshine d Of course, I appreciate that the police had to be called in. After all, the criminal must be apprehended and punished. Of course, my lord. At the same time, Lattimer, I rely on you to see... that not one breath of scandal attaches itself... either to my name or to the name of my opera. I have already given instructions to the police to that effect. The whole affair has been acutely embarrassing for me. It's been quite terrible, you understand? I doubt if the damage to my work can ever really be repaired. Maria has refused ever to sing in this country again. Heaven knows where we'll ever find anyone to take her place. Mr. Hunter is already investigating that possibility, my lord. In what way is he "investigating that possibility"? He is holding auditions this morning. Without consulting me? He said he thought it would be the best thing. I shall decide what is best and what is not best for my opera. How dare he? D A garden I know of roses d d By moonlight silvered over d d Upon the lake reposes d d A lovely lotus flower d d Upon lake reposes d Hunter... Listen to me, Hunter. You listen to her. D A lovely lotus flower d d And there we will sit and rest us d d Under the palm tree shade d d And dream that love d d Has blessed us d d And joy will never fade d d That joy d d will never d d fade What's your name? Christine Charles, sir. You sang that beautifully, Miss Charles. I don't think we need to look any further, do you? She's a very lovely girl. She's got a very lovely voice, too. Go wait in your dressing room, Miss Charles. I'll leave you to fix the contract, shall I? She'll need a bit of coaching, of course. We should be able to open in a week or two with a bit of luck. Bill, Act 1, Scene 1. Start rehearsing in 15 minutes. Right. Come along, girls. Give that to Miss Charles. That was very good. Wonderful. I wish I could sing like that. So do I. I'm sure you'll get the part. Absolutely wonderful. It was marvelous. Miss Charles. Yes? From Lord Ambrose d'Arcy. Thank you. I say. What is it? What have you got? Tell us. I'm to dine with him tonight. Oh, you lucky girl. Caviar and champagne! How marvelous. I've got nothing to wear. You can borrow my blue. I'll loan you my green. You're about my size. Wardrobe will lend you something. This is an occasion. You must have something new. But I can't possibly afford anything. How much can you afford? A few shillings, that's all I have. Well, I can let you have five. Oh, no. I can spare half a crown. Me, too. You mustn't. You stay here and get ready, and as soon as we've got a moment for you... we'll come and help you choose it. But really. Come on, girls. Good luck. Congratulations. Don't worry. Young woman. Young woman, listen to me. Who is that? Who are you? Be quiet, and listen. You sang well, but you will sing better. I shall teach you. When you sing, it will be only for me. Please, who are you? Only for me, do you understand? I understand what you say, but... You are dining with Ambrose d'Arcy tonight. Be warned, he is a vile and vicious man. Who are you? Where are you hiding? Please tell me. I forgot this. Please, tell me who you are. Mademoiselle. I believe Lord Ambrose d'Arcy is expecting me. Of course. How charming you look, my dear. Shall I serve the champagne, my lord? Of course. It's very pretty here, isn't it? I expect you'll have guessed why I invited you here? Yes, I think so. We'll eat a little, drink a little champagne, then we'll talk about it. No, thank you. I insist. No, really, thank you. A brandy, then? Waiter. Yes, my lord. Tell Xavier we don't want to be disturbed. Yes, my lord. Now... that little matter we were going to discuss. About your singing in my new opera. You guessed it was that, didn't you? Yes. Of course, you did. You've got a brain in that pretty little head of yours. A brain and a voice. A good singing voice. Small, mind you, needs training, but it's there. Just wants bringing out, training. I know. Needs a lot of training. I realize that, of course. Of course, I'm a busy man. I think I might be able to spare you a few minutes now and then. Just a few, mind. If only you could, I'd be so grateful. I'd expect you to be grateful. You're a delicious little thing. I'm going to enjoy teaching you. I have an idea. Let's have the first lesson now, right away. The theater will be closed. My apartment won't. No, I couldn't. I'm an expert teacher. No, please. Do you want to sing in my new opera or don't you? You know I do. Very well, then. Good evening, Mr. Hunter. Good evening, Xavier. Not too late, am I? No, no, no, no. Good evening, Ambrose. Good evening, Harry. Miss Charles. Mr. Hunter. Lord Ambrose has very kindly offered to coach me in my singing. Has he? Tonight. Tonight? Yes. I wondered if you could possibly spare the time. That is, if you would care to. But of course. Nothing I'd like better than watching Ambrose teaching you how to sing. Shall we go? But, Mr. Hunter. I've changed my mind, Xavier. I'm putting on weight. Ambrose. It is rather late. They'll fetch you a cab, Miss Charles. No need. She can come with me. Thank you. It's a pleasure, believe me. Miss Charles. You're not really putting on weight, are you? I don't think so. Then you must be starving. Please go back, I can easily find my own way home. Have you eaten? Why, yes. But did you actually eat anything? I was too nervous. Will you join me for supper, Miss Charles? For two this time, Xavier. Of course, Mr. Hunter. Thank you for everything. He must have been furious. I suppose tomorrow I shall be back singing in the chorus again. If there is a chorus tomorrow. We've had a strange run of bad luck with this opera, Christine. From the moment we started rehearsing. First it was little, irritating things. Music disappearing, costumes torn, scenery damaged. Then things got worse, and finally, last night, a man was killed on the stage. The police say... The police say it was suicide. You don't believe that? I think there is something evil in this theater, Christine. Something or someone trying to stop the opera from ever being performed. When I was sitting in my dressing room today... I thought I heard a voice speaking to me. Today? When? Just after I had the invitation from Lord Ambrose. A voice warned me not to go. He spoke... He? Yes, it was a man's voice. Did you recognize it? No, I'd never heard it before. He spoke quietly but very clearly, so that I could hear every word. You couldn't see him? No. Was it dark? No. Perhaps he was hiding somewhere. In the wardrobe, a cupboard. I didn't see him because he wasn't there. Were you afraid? Afraid? No. Would you go back there with me? Now? Yes. Yes. L... Cabbie. Hello. Take us to the Opera House. What, now? Now. Well, it's closed. Yes, I know. Quick as you can. All right. Come on, girl. No one ever seems to lose anything worth losing nowadays. No. Like a nice diamond tiara. Hello, what have we here? If you've come to see the show, you're a bit late, dearie. Isn't he handsome. He's lovely. He's got his girlfriend with him. Looking for a nice dark corner to do a bit of courting, was you? Good evening. My name's Hunter. I'm the producer of the opera. Yeah, and I'm the Queen of England. Now be off with you and do your wooing elsewhere. But I assure you... Go on. Get out of here. You haven't found a small diamond brooch, have you? When did you lose it? Last night. Last night? Where was you sitting? Stalls. Front or back? Front. That's me. Let me give you a hand, dear. Keep your thieving hands away. It's all mine. Do you think it might still be in the theater? He's right. Come on, girls. The front stall's mine. Come back, you thieving lot. They're mine, I say. Now, can you remember which direction this voice came from? Well, not exactly. Sit down exactly just as you were sitting when you heard it. You were sitting there and the voice came from... The voice came from somewhere over there. The gas. Harry. Don't be afraid. Mr. Hunter. Mr. Hunter. I do not want you meling... with something that does not concern you. Do you understand? No, I do not. Who are you? Get away from here, get away. You do not know what may happen to you. I'm not easily frightened. Then you should be. My threat is not an idle one. There are forces of evil at large in the opera tonight. Leave the girl and go while you may. Do you hear me? Leave the girl here and go. It's him. The Phantom. We saw him. Harry, look. It's only the old ratcatcher. Don't be alarmed. I won't do you no harm. Think I must have given them cleaners a bit of a turn. They're usually gone by the time I'm around. I'm the ratcatcher, you see, sir. Place is alive with them. I searches them out with me lamp... then I sort of hypnotizes them... till I'm near enough to pounce. I'm sorry, lady. I caught a couple of beauties tonight, sir. Fat. Like young puppies, they are. Here, I'll show you. Now, none of that. I'll find them for you in a moment, sir. You'll never believe your eyes. Please stop him. Please don't bother on our account. No? I could let you have them both for tuppence, sir. They'd make a lovely pie, you know. We're vegetarians. Pity. Here's something for your trouble, though. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much, sir. Well, good night to you then. Wait here. Young woman. Young woman, you must come with me. It's all right. I did see him, Harry. He was standing there at the top of the stairs. And he had one eye and a mask? Yes, all black. And he stood there staring and staring at me. It felt as if he was trying to burn a hole in my brain. The kettle's on and tea won't be a minute. How are you feeling, my dear? She needs to sleep. Quite. A nice cup of tea, then off to bed with you. You do believe me, Harry. Yes, I believe you, Christine. Useless. No good at all. For heaven's sake, get rid of her. All right, stop. That's enough. Next please. I should like to sing Adele's Song from Fledermaus. Whenever you are ready, my dear. D With a man like you d d And with a girl like me d d You really should beware d d Looking in your eyes d d It is no surprise d d I'll tell my heart, take care d d And if I should let myself go d d We'll sample some pleasures I know d d We'll drink to each other d d We'll tell one another d d Of everlasting love d d Of everlasting love d d Such a man as you d d With a girl like me d d You really should beware d d Looking into your eyes d d It is no surprise d d I'll tell my heart, take care Quite excellent. Needs a little work, of course. Tell her to come to my office. Very good, my dear. Thank you. Thank you very much. That's all, thank you very much. What' s going on, Ambrose? I have been endeavoring to find someone... with the ability to do justice to the leading role in my opera, Mr. Hunter. I thought you'd agreed that Miss Charles was to sing it. You may have thought so. Now, if you'll excuse me. No. Have I not made myself sufficiently clear? Miss Charles is not to sing in my opera. Not in the leading part nor in any other. She has received her dismissal this morning. You small-minded, fatheaded... Be careful, Mr. Hunter. Because she refuses to go to your apartment... in the mile of the night... You're dismissed. You understand? Now get out of my way. Sorry, Harry. He made me send the note round by hand. I'll go and see her. If anything else happens, let me know, will you? Yes. No, he can't. It's not fair. Of course it's not. If he's stopped me from playing St. Joan... Not to let me sing at all, it just isn't fair. Fairness isn't one of his virtues, Christine. I forgot to ask... I'm sorry. It's all right, Mrs. Tucker. I thought you'd like a glass of sherry wine, but perhaps... Nothing I'd like better, Mrs. Tucker. I'll drink it... while Miss Charles is getting ready to come and have lunch with me. No, Harry. I couldn't. Of course you could. I insist that you come and celebrate. Celebrate, Mr. Hunter? Yes, Mrs. Tucker. Today, we both got the sack. Oh, no, Harry. Oh, yes, Harry. So we've both got nothing to do and all the time in the world to do it in. And I'll allow you just... ten minutes of it to get ready. Not a moment more. I'll try. I wonder if you could tell me where you got this. Got it? I made it. You... Where did you get this music from? That's some of the Professor's. Professor Petrie. He used to teach singing at the Academy. When he remembered to go there, that is. He was a little bit... But very nice. He used to play the piano all day long. I have mostly musicians stay with me, you know. He used to play night and day. I just loved listening to him. Then the neighbors started banging on the walls, so I had to put a stop to it. Do you think it'd be possible for me to have a closer look at that music? Well... If it's not too much trouble. No, he left a whole pile of it here. He left me enough to paper the house. But I threw some of it out. Here's some, but it's a bit faded now. I remember that bit. What became of this Professor, Mrs. Tucker? He was killed. Burned to death in a fire. It was terrible. A fire? At a printer's. He'd gone to see them about printing his music. The whole place caught fire while he was there. Do you know the name of this printer's, Mrs. Tucker? Let me see. Yes. It was Piggot's. By London Bridge. Ready. In five minutes exactly. Good girl. Thank you very much, Mrs. Tucker, for all your help. What about your sherry... Of course. Goodbye, Mrs. Tucker. The fire, sir. That would be a bit before my time. Perhaps you would care to see our Mr. Weaver, sir? He's the master printer. He's been here a very long time. Yes, I'd like that very much. I'll see if he's available, sir. What is this, Harry? It's a long story. I'll tell you over lunch. Mr. Weaver? You were enquiring about the fire, sir? Yes, well, rather about someone who died in the fire. No one died. But I understood that someone was burned to death in the fire. Someone was badly burned, sir. But he didn't die. Not here, anyway. What happened? He broke in one night, sir. He must have knocked over a lamp or something... and put the whole place ablaze. He tried to put it out with... what he thought was water, sir. But it was some of this. For etching the plates. He threw a whole jarful at the flames. Some of it splashed back in his face. Nitric acid, sir. What became of him? He ran out screaming. No one ever saw any more of him. And you've no idea who he was? No, sir. Nor why he broke in? He was a burglar. I suppose, sir. Thank you very much for seeing us, Sergeant. I'm sure you must be very busy. It is quite all right, sir. I'm enquiring about a fire. A fire, sir? At Piggot's, the printers. Do you remember it? I remember it well, sir. I was on duty. Saw it all. There was a man badly burned. There was indeed, sir. He came running out of that place screaming blue murder... if you'll pardon the expression, Miss. Where did he run to? Straight up the street and into the river. The river? That's right, Miss. Straight in, he went. About here. So that's where he went. Who, Harry? Who is this mystery man? I'll tell you over lunch. Lunch? It's almost three. Is it? Well, tea then. We'll have tea in the park, then a row on the lake... and dinner at Frascati's. And then perhaps we'll have some supper. The cab's stopped. Has it? Well, tell him to go round the park again. Harry, we can't. He's been round four times already. Well, perhaps he likes it. Cabbie, would you mind taking us round the park again? Well, sir, being a pleasant enough evening for myself... I wouldn't mind a bit. I don't suppose old Lightning here would grumble much either. But, me missus... Me missus has a nervous disposition. She don't like being left on her own at nighttime. She don't. So, if you wouldn't mind, sir. I understand perfectly. Thought you would, sir. Looks like I'll have to take you home. Thank you for a lovely day. The first of many, I wouldn't wonder, Miss, eh? I think I'll just go and inspect the harness, sir. All in order, sir. All in order, sir, with the harness. Yes, I'll just climb aboard again. Harry, you never did tell me about that mystery man, you know. It's quite simple. I found out how Ambrose d'Arcy managed to write such good music. He didn't. Someone else wrote it for him. Are you sure? Near enough. What are you going to do? Nothing. The real composer's dead. We've enough trouble without making more. All right then, sir? Very all right, thank you. All right. We're away then. Come on, Lightning. We'll soon be home now. I am going to teach you to sing, Christine. I am going to give you a new voice. A voice so wonderful... that the theaters all over the world will be filled with your admirers. You will be the greatest star the opera has ever known. Greater than the greatest. And when you sing, Christine... you will be singing only... for me. D Most noble Lord Dauphin d d I am sent by God d d to bring succor to your Kingdom No, not like that. Now start again. D Most noble Lord Dauphin d d I am sent by God d d to bring succor to your Kingdom If you watch me carefully, my dear, I'll give you your cue. Just one moment, Mr. Rossi. I am taking this rehearsal. When I require any help from you, I shall ask for it. Then you had better ask for it now because you most certainly need it. What did you say? Stop it, stop it I say! You're dismissed. Good morning, gentlemen. What are they playing at? Stop them. Stop. Where are you going? Stop, I say. You're dismissed. They're all dismissed. You, too. And you. You come to my office. At once. Good morning, sir. Good morning. Good morning, sir. Good morning. What's happening, Bill? We've all been dismissed. What? You, too? Yes, and I can't say I'm sorry. Good morning, sir. Good morning. How could they do this to me? My first opera and I'm let down on every side. First, I'm haunted by ghosts, and now all this. It really is too much. Well, say something. What am I going to do? I think you should ask Mr. Hunter to come back. What? What did you say? I think you should apologize to Mr. Hunter and ask him to come back. How dare you? I dare because as manager of this opera house... I am responsible to my director for its welfare. And if I allow you to carry on in this manner, we shall all be made bankrupt. I refuse to stay and listen to this treason. Very well. But if you go, I shall take it upon myself to ask Mr. Hunter to return. Well done, Lattimer. I think, I feel quite... Brandy. Where do you keep it? I don't know how I dared. I'll never forget the expression on his face. Mr. Hunter, what have I done? You've proved that you're a man and not a mouse. You've also persuaded me to come back and help you clear up this mess. Will you? Will you really? I'll just join you in one of these to celebrate, then we'll get down to work, shall we? Thank you, gentlemen, thank you. Would you two change places? That's good. Would you come forward a few paces, please? Thank you. I am sorry, ladies and gentlemen, I shall have to leave for a few minutes. I hope I won't be very long. Carry on, Bill. Harry. Right, we'll go from the opening scene. Her bed hasn't been slept in, but she must have gone up there... because her coat was hanging in the wardrobe... and the window was wide open, and I never leave the window wide open... because you know why. She can't have left very early, can she, without your knowing? I'm up at 5:30 every morning. I don't sleep very well at the best of times. Wind, you know. I'm terribly troubled with the wind. Just as soon as she does return, perhaps you could ask her to come to the theater. I shall tell her at once, Mr. Hunter. I just can't think what could have happened to her. Better. Again. Better. Again. I can't. You little fool. Do you think you can become a great singer without suffering? Do you think I have not suffered? The scoundrel. But sir, there is 10 years' work there. 10 years of my life. Surely 50 is... I'm sorry, I accept. Thank you. Thank you. Sing! Use that wonderful gift that God has given you. Good. Now the melody. Listen carefully to the phrasing. You begin very quietly. Then build. Keep the tone spinning. Build your voice until the auditorium is filled... with the beautiful sound of it. How can you be sure that he died? That's what I want to know. What makes you sure? Current's very fast here. He'd never have stood a chance. That's why we're sure. Did you drag the river? Well, did you? I've just said the river runs very fast, sir. What would have been the good? Now, I've got work to do, sir, even if you haven't. All right, Sergeant. Well, thank you anyway. Water. Now, this time sing properly. Do you understand? Use your voice, do you understand? Use your voice from here. Let her sleep. What was that? Scoundrel, it's my music. It's my music. It's my... Here, Professor Petrie. You'd better take him. Did he harm you? No. How do you know my name? I know who you are, Professor, because I made it my business to find out. I also know something else about you. The opera we've been rehearsing was composed by you, wasn't it? Yes, that is true. You took it to Ambrose d'Arcy for help in getting it published, didn't you? What happened? What happened? I took him all of my music. ?50, no more. But there is 10 years' work there. Ten years of my life, sir. Surely ?50 is... Am I not correct in thinking that... you have never had any of your work published, Professor... Petrie? Not, not yet, but... So you are completely unknown. Of course, but everybody... There are many unknown composers... who'd be only too glad to have their works published... without any fee at all. Come, I'm a busy man. No. There's a full symphony here, sir, and two quartets... and a concerto for viola. And an opera, sir, a new opera, complete. I'm sorry. I accept. Come in tomorrow and the papers will be ready to sign. It is embarrassing for me to have to ask this... but perhaps you could manage... What? I owe my landlady quite a sum. A small advance, perhaps. Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow. Thank you. Look at it. Look at it, man. Filthy. Yes, my lord. Do you expect me to be seen driving in that? No, my lord. Do it again. Yes, my lord. Have it ready by this evening. Yes, my lord. Lord Ambrose. Please excuse this intrusion, but I must see you. They said I should find you here. My music... Tomorrow. Tomorrow may be too late. They're printing my music with... I think you mean my music, don't you? I don't understand. I bought it from you, remember? Yes, to publish, yes. But they're printing your name on the cover. My name on my music. Is that so surprising? You can't mean it. If you'll kindly excuse me. You thief. Scoundrel. Cabbie, go. It's my music. Who he is, I do not know... and as he cannot speak, I shall never know. Sometimes he's uncontrollable, like a wild animal. But he has saved my life... and has looked after me ever since. And you've lived down here all these years? And I shall die down here. Look, I am dying already. But before I go... I implore you, allow me to finish one thing. Let me teach you to use that wonderful voice that God has given you. Then you may never see me again... but you will never forget. Please, give me a little time. A month, two weeks. One week even. One week, and I will work a miracle. She will sing for me as she has never sung before. And I will hear my work performed. Please.
