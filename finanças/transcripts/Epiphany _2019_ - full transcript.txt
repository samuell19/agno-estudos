- The old men of Tarpon Springs say the boy who gets the cross at the Epiphany ceremony is forever changed. He is enlightened, closer to his faith, and brings luck to his family. Ultimately, unity will come to that family. Unity will come. Can I play? - Solitaire. Good morning, Tarpon Springs. Got some flowing sunshine for us today with a high of 80 degrees. Not so bad for it's almost Christmas time. Let's hope today's weather sticks around... Are preparing to dive for the cross... Epiphany Celebration next week. - It stinks, right? - No, it's fine. - You're gonna have to get used to it if you keep coming out with us. - Graveyard down there. - This should be the sweet spot. We'll go out to another area one more time. - I'm telling you, there's nothing down there. - There's not enough! I was told by my aunt that my father tried several times to get the cross as a boy. He tried for that unity, but it never came to him. To us. - Shake it up, I need the big ones. How many times I have to tell you? - Hey, Peter! Uncle Peter, I think this boat is coming. Hey! Hey! You're gonna go over the hose! Stop! - What the hell? I'm sorry. - What, are you trying to kill me down there? - No, a boat came close... - What are you doing? Wake up! Why didn't you wake him up? I tried! - They cut my air off. It came close and I was yelling and it just stopped and it was... - I almost died down there! Oh my God. Gimme that. Damn it. What's he doing? - He came up too fast, now he's trying to go down and come up the right way with the proper stuff. - No, no, these are good, look at these. - I'll be lookin'. - Come on, Bill. What are you talking about? They're perfect sponges, they're good. - Fellas, take it. I come back later pick up the sponges. See you guys later. Hey. Look at you. - Ooh, look at me. Look at you. All dressed up. Come on, let's get out of here. What's this? - That's mine. Whoa. - That's private. - Have you been doing your prayers? - Yeah. - They're very important. Do you think that things will be different now she's gone? Come on get ready, we're late. - Do I have to go? I said I was sorry like a billion times already. - The Father needs your help. - You mean it's my punishment. - Get going. That one's Saint Paul. - He doesn't look like he belongs. - Once a persecutor of Christians. Then he brought us the words of Jesus. - Bad man that became good? - We can all change. Luka, do you know why you're here? - Because I took the youth group money. - And why did you take it? - I don't know. - Our ministry at Sunshine needs volunteers. I would like for you to put some hours in there. - I wanna be an altar girl. - There are traditions in the church. You can't. - Why not? Because it's just for boys? - Luka, it's okay to still be sad about your Aunt Maria. - I'm fine. - I can't help you unless you let me. - Do you know anything about my father? - Your father and uncle came a long time ago, during a difficult time on their island. Talk to him. - Hi. - Whatcha doin'? - Not much. Hey. - How's your brother? - He's good, he's washing the boat today. - Oh yeah? You guys out all week? - Yeah, two. Just got back in this morning. - Anything good? - Nah. - You stayin'? - He can't. - Come on! He's a big boy. - No, I'm in. - You know, if anything goes missing around here I'm gonna know who to look for. - Well, he said I had to put in an hour, so. - Why don't you go find a patient to read to? All right, they love it. - Ooh, girl, I don't think you wanna be doin' that. We call that one right there Crab Apple. - Well. What do we got here? Listen, young lady, I'm not a baby that you have to read to put to sleep. I don't need those stories, okay? - You got something better? - What did you do, little girl, to get yourself in here? Somethin' pretty bad I bet. - You sure got a lot of stuff. - Yes, a lifetime. - Who is that woman? - That's my wife. - She's pretty. - Yes. What are you readin', honey? A lot of words. You see this on my arm? You won't find a story like that in here. How's Luka? - She's okay, she's good. - Even with Maria gone? - You know, Peter's taking care of it. She's still better off. - I see. First. - Come on. What are you doin' here? - Look, it's time to go. - Luka, go home. - But you shouldn't be here. - Theo, maybe you should just... - Get the hell out of here! - Peter. You haven't returned any of my calls. Will you take a seat for a minute? We remortgaged your house in 2012, right? - Yeah. - Okay, well, moving forward, what can we do here? - You don't look so good, man. - I'm good, I'm good. - Maybe we take a break, eh, guys? Game's almost over. - I got this. - Just take a minute. - Okay, fine fine. - Oh, you're awake. Do you know where you are? - Yeah. How long I been here for? - Well, you have decompression sickness. You were leveling out for the last five hours in that chamber there. May I? - Yeah, sure. - Okay. - Are we done here? - No, no, whoa. Your body just experienced major trauma. You need to rest. - I don't have time to rest. Or money for that matter. - Well, I hate to disappoint, but the admin woman will be back around later to get your information. - Yeah, I'm sure she will be. - Your brother said it was a diving accident. - Oh, is that what he said? - And your daughter was here earlier. - Is she still here? - No, I gave her a progress report and sent her home. Relax. So what were you diving for? - Just mermaids. - Sponge diver in Tarpon? - Yeah, you been there? - A few times. I go to the Epiphany every year. - Oh. 'Cause nothing says you love God more than an Archbishop throwing a giant cross in the water, right? - Yeah, well, they throw a good party afterwards. Hello. - Who won the game? - I spoke to Alex. - About what? - A job for you at Clearwater. - Painting. You're kidding me, right? - Look, I don't wanna do this anymore with you. - What? - I'm tired. Look, I had your back, brother, for a long time. - You can't let me go, and you know it. Who's gonna dive? You? - I'll manage. - And you're kicking me out for what, huh? - We needed that money for the business and you pissed it away. Like you always do. - If I had more time in the game I would have doubled our money for us. - Enough! It's the same line over and over. I can't keep carrying you. - Yeah, you got my back, brother. - Hey. Don't just stand there, Robin Hood. Come on, baby, come here. Say something to me, please. - I know you don't want me to read to you. - No. - So, can I play? - Sure, baby. - Can I have some? - No. Take a smell of it, it's awful. It's for old geezers and medical people. Did you love your wife? - Yes, I did. The days before the invasion, she and me were very happy. She would dance around and sing around my house. - What invasion? - Turkey invaded my island. - Oh. - Cyprus. - I know it. My father's from there. So you had two sons. - You've been listening, huh? - Are you rich? - Why are you askin'? You plan to take all my money? Too bad for you. I just was a poor fisherman. What do you got? - Spades. - I got three aces. No I don't. - She told you Lenny went to Colimos early, right? You got all your stuff, you got your toothbrush? See you in a week. - Hey. Get to work. - Can I help? - Sure, do whatever. - Where'd you get her? - I won her in a game of cards. - Can we take her out eventually? Doesn't have a motor. - Too much money? - Yeah, you catch on pretty quick. I already got a little stash put aside, just need some more. - Okay, well, where did you get the other money. Maybe you can just... - This is my quiet time now, okay? - Okay, got it. - Hey, don't touch my stuff again, okay? - I just wanted to try it on. - Oh what, you're wearing berets in your hair now? - Why not? - I don't know. Wear berets. - Whose is that? - What? - Did that belong to my mother? - Your grandmother. Will you tell me about here? - Not right now. - Why don't I live here with you? - It's a small place. - You could get something bigger. - Not that easy. I'm sure you could work it out. - It's more money. - So if we had more money? - No. - And, by the way, I'm allergic to strawberries. - Hey. - Hey. How was the trip? - It was all right. A short stop, it's Epiphany. - I wanna dive at the Epiphany. - You know it's just for boys. - I wish I'd been born a boy. You know, maybe then... - Then what? - You could have a chance at good luck. - Yeah, well, God knows this family needs it. Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead. I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus. A special blessing to these young men who have readied themselves through prayer and proper preparation to retrieve the victorious symbol of your most precious and life giving cross from these waters. Guide them always that they may prove to be worthy examples to their peers, their families, and to all members of this community. Through the faith they demonstrate to you and through the love now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen. Young men strong. We pray to you, O lovely Lord, to bless this, our annual gathering to commemorate your holy baptism in the River Jordan, today, the day of the Epiphany. - What the hell do you think you were doing? Huh? Cover yourself. - Peter. Take it easy, huh? - Why shouldn't our family have a chance? Can I have some money? - Hey, leave her alone. She's been through a lot with Maria's passing. - You're a good man, Peter. To your brother. - I've got nothing to be proud of. Nothing to show for all these years. - Could have had more if you weren't carrying someone else. - It wasn't just him. I had expenses with Maria. What we have we earned together. - There's room for you at the painting job too. - To our health, to our health. Yes. - Do you know what you're doing there? - I can handle it. - Had a lot of ouzo in your lifetime? - Oh. Bartender, another please. - Make that two. - So you find any mermaids lately? - Oh. You. Well, well, well. - Cheers. Yeah. Handled it. How bad? Where'd you learn how to dance like that? - I don't know. I guess it's in the bones. Like a swaying tree. It's the drunken dance, the blues dance. - Drunken dance? You're staring at me. I did it wrong. - No, you did good. You did it real good. - Oh hi. Hi. - Oh, I like these. - My mom used to collect sand dollars when I was a kid. You know... Thank you. One side is like a flower. Legend has it that doves live inside, and if you crack it open you're spreading peace and goodwill. Here. - Whoa, I've never heard that story. I like that. Oh my God, it's like a little dove. That's so beautiful. - Yeah, it is. - Well, thank you. - Thanks. You're welcome. I... I'm on call really early in the morning, so I have to go. - Why don't you stay a little bit longer, huh? Please. I don't know anything about you. - Maybe just a little bit. - But you never know. - I can't do it. You just never know. - Did you fix it? - That should do it. Here's your bill. I could do it. - Do what? Help you on the boat. - What do you know about it? - A lot, I've been watching these last two months. I'm learning. - No. - Why not? Just let me pick up the slack for him. I can help you. - I said no. - You're a local celebrity. - Yeah. - You look sad. - Well, it was only a couple months after we arrived here. I didn't really wanna be here, so. - Where in Greece are you from? - Not Greece, Cyprus. Close. - I've been there. - Really, where about? - All over, but my favorite spot was Aphrodite's rock. - Oh. Petra tou Romiou. Birthplace of Aphrodite. Beautiful, huh. - So beautiful. Do you miss it? - Yeah. Oh hey. Look at this. This would be perfect for you, huh? Look at that. - Mine are better. - You think so? - Yeah. This must be perfect for Luka, huh? - Well, you know she's kind of a different kid, so you never know. - Different in what way? - I don't know, she gets in trouble at school. - Rebel. - Yeah, you could say that. Although I have no idea where she gets it from. But, yeah she got caught stealing a couple months ago. - Maybe she needs attention. - Or boarding school. I don't know, I'm just not that person. - Oh, Luka, we're going on a tour boat. You gonna come with us? - Should I? - Why not? Anybody wanna go sponge boat ride, we're leaving now. We've been doing this tour here simply because the Greeks starting doing it over a thousand years ago. - What's your name? - And the reason we do it is there's a very large market still for sponges. Now what our early sponge divers were after is this product right here, the natural sponge, that we usually harvest in this type of suit. The suit is made out of two layers of canvas, one layer of rubber. It is water tight, it's skin tight sometimes, cutting off the circulation. Hello, Robin Hood. - Crab Apple. - How long you been there? - Few minutes. - This place is a hole. They bring ya the worst food, ya know? On top of that, no one visits me except my good son. Only the strong survives, not the weak. Where did you get that? - Oh, it's my father's. - What's your father's name? - Theo. - Here. Go on, take that, please. - It's not mine. - Which one are you? The strong or the weak? You should go, I'm tired now. - Bye. I wanna learn how to carve. - I'm not a very good teacher. Here. You try. - Like this? - Yeah, watch yourself. Cool. Hey Bobby. You looking for work? - What is it? - Two weeks starting tomorrow. - With you? No, I'm good. Hey, you guys looking for work? Is Cyprus like Tarpon Springs? No, it's green here. Island is arid and blue. - What was my grandfather like? - He'd dead. He had to go off to fight in a war. So, you know, he wasn't around very much. When he was... - What? - Well, let's just say he wasn't a very nice person. - What do you mean? - I can still hear the sound of his belt snappin'. - Hey. - Oh, hi. What are you doing here? We said seven, right? - I thought we said tomorrow. - Is this a thing? - Sorry, Luka, I'll go. So sorry, I thought it was tonight. - It's fine, come on. What are you doing in here? - Nothing. - I don't want you in here. - I was just laying here. - Well, never mind, get ready for school. - I really miss her. - I know. - I think about her everyday. Can I have this? - I don't want her stuff moved around in here. - She would have wanted me to have it. She wore it all the time. - Yeah, I know. I bought it for her when things were going well. - Oh hey. - I can go, I just... - No, no no, no. Come on in. - Are you staying? - What do you mean? - Never mind. - Is everything okay? - Tomorrow's my birthday. - Happy early birthday. - Thanks. I'm not sure if anyone here even remembers. - Well, now I know. Are you hungry? The Crema's too thin. - Oh. It needs to be thicker. - Okay. So did your Dad teach you how to do this? - No, my Aunt Maria, actually. - Oh. What happened to her? - She had breast cancer. - I'm sorry. - What good are they if they make you die? - Well, you may feel differently when you get older. - You know, she and I would always stay up late, and she would read to me. She called me her little lagoonie. It means my sweet. - Oh, I like that. You know, Luka's a really good name too. - My real name's Lucas. They thought I was gonna be a boy. - My parents said I was gonna be a boy too. Yeah, it was something about the way my mother was carrying me. I've never had a child of my own, so I don't know that personally. - Why not? - I can't. I did try. - I'm sorry. - No, that's okay. How's that lookin'? - Pretty good. Pretty nice job for your first try though. - You're a pro. - Had a lot of practice. - Hey. Where is she? In the bathroom. - Before you guys got here she was acting crazy and biting my head off. - Did you talk to her? - Well, I don't know what to say to her. - Same old story. - Hey Luka, it's Cari. Wanna open up? Can I come in? Hey. What's goin' on, birthday girl? I saw your Dad got you a birthday cake. - Yeah, Peter got it. And he also got me a stupid dress for the dance. He just kept saying, "It would have made Maria so happy. "She would have loved it." No, she wouldn't have. She never would have bought me a dress. They don't know me at all. - They are trying. - It's white. Well, what's wrong with white? - How old were you when you got your... - Oh, you got your period. That's awesome. You're becoming a woman. Here you go. - I just don't wanna be anything. - I get it. But maybe this will cheer you up. I'll leave you be. - Hey, hey. Please, man, this is my stuff. Hey, hey, hey, hang on a second, man. - Peter, what's goin' on? - Please, please sir. - Sir, we gave you a deadline. - That's my wife's. Be careful, huh. - Sir, step off the boat. - Please! - Sir, get off the boat or I will take action! - Come on, Pete. - What the hell are you doing here? - Hey, I got a call. - Oh, so now you two are working together. Well, I don't want your help, so what are you doing here? - I'm just trying... - This is because of you. What? - It's always the same. You do what you want when you want. - Come on, don't throw this back on me now, all right? What do you want from me? - I want you to... Just forget it. - You did this, you pushed me out. - Just leave, huh. Leave like you always do. - That's it, take what you want. - Whose are these? - They were my wife's. Here, come sit down. I'll tell you all about her, okay. She died in her '30s, when she was 32. Theo. - Oh my God. Oh my God. - What's going on? - Nothing. - You okay? - What do you want from me? - Just wanna help you. - Oh God I keep seeing that. Oh, God, her face. Right before it happened. I can't get it out of my head. God. - Oh, good morning. I made breakfast. - I'm not hungry. - Luka's been asking me questions. - Ah, not this again. - She just really wants to spend time with you. I know. - And she's really lost. I'm just trying to help. - Stop trying. - You know, if I had kids, I would wanna spend time with them. - Don't lecture me on parenting. - The woman in your nightmares. - I don't wanna talk about it. - You don't wanna talk about anything. You can deal with yourself and be a father too. - You comin' at me, it is not helping. You know, since I met you everything is just so messed up. - What are you talking about? You're shutting me out because you don't wanna face the facts that you refuse to connect with me or anyone for that matter. - Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you're a psychiatrist as well. - I'm not. - I can't. This was a mistake. - You tell yourself whatever you want. She needs you. - Thalassa. - What the hell? - I need to ask you something about my grandmother. - Where is it? - Where's what? - You know what I'm talking about. Answer me. - Hey, leave her alone. - She's my kid, I got a right to ask her if I want to. - Oh, right, you think you're gonna be a father now, huh? - Don't you start. - I'm the one that raised her, fed her, clothed her. - It's because of those pills that you're on. - You have to take responsibility now! - It isn't my fault that you couldn't have a kid of your own. - Oh, you think you're some kind of savior? Huh? You came in here and you saved a poor couple by giving them a baby girl. Is that what you think? Hey, did your father ever tell you about that time when me and Maria took you to the hospital for whooping cough? He decided to skip town on a gambling rampage. Or how about your Christening? I caught him dead drunk with one of the waitresses in the bathroom. And how he pleaded with your young mother to not... - Shut your mouth! Okay, just shut up! Don't listen to him, Luka. He doesn't know what he's sayin'. He's so hopped up on morphine. Yeah, that's right, he's been filling your aunt's prescription. Luka, open up. You happy now? - With Maria gone everything just feels so wrong. What does she have here? - A home. - She wants you. I can't be you, I'm not her father. - Excuse me, are you the parent of Luka Markou? - Yeah. - What's taking so long? Okay, so I'm just gonna need to have you sign for documentation. - I should do it. I'm her legal guardian. - Oh, 'kay. So, since most of the items have been sold and the money spent, the patients have decided not to press charges, just so long as you pay back what the items are worth. - Well, how much? - About five thousand dollars. It's... - What? I only got 750 from the pawn shop. - What were you doing there in the first place? - Father Nick sent me to read to them. - But why would you take those things? - I didn't take them, he gave them to me. Look, I swear, I just wanted to get money for your boat, and we have money now to put towards that motor. - Motor? - I was doing it for you. For us. - What happens if we can't pay? - No, I got it, I got it. I have it. I just need some time. - You just gonna keep staring at your shoes, boy? - I... - Spit it out, will you? You were never a big talker. Always up in the clouds. I would always find you doing those damn figures. She did that to you. Always so delicate like a little girl. - And I'm still your son. - And I always wanted more for you. - Why do you hate me so much? - Never, a father can't hate his son. I was trying to do right by you. - Do right? - You know, the kid is nothing like you are. She's strong. Peter will take good care of her, he'll guide her. Thank God he's the one raising her. But then I could see it. - See what? - You in her. - Yeah, is that why you planted that stuff on her? She said that she got everything from in here. You stole it from the others in here, right? - You didn't want your own kid to know her grandfather. You see, you and I are exactly the same. You always thought I was a piece of trash. Well, what are you... - You always blamed me. You could never forget. - Do you really want to hear I wish it was you instead of my wife? I wish it was you, I loved her more than anything. - So did I. - Get out! Your fault she died. Your brother told me. You went back for the stupid marriage. - All in. - All in. - Wow. Wow. - Thank you very much, gentlemen. - No, no, I wanna play again. Better luck next time. - No, no no, no. No, I wanna play again. - Game's over, man. - I wanna play again! The game is over. - This can't be. - Can't do this. - Wait! - Listen, just get in your car and leave. - No, I need that money. - You better watch yourself, pal. - Go home. - What happened? Just leave. - Please. - What do you want with me, huh? - I just... - Go, I can't deal with you right now. - I just wanna help you. - You don't think you've done enough already? - Why did you lie to me? Why did you tell me he was dead? - Why did you go down there to him? - I didn't mean to. I told you the priest told me to. I wasn't trying to... - Did your grandfather tell you about what kind of a man he is? What kind of a father he was? - Sorry. Look, I know what you went through. - What did he say about me? - I wanna give this back. I'm sorry, I never should have taken it in the first place. This is yours, just take it. - No. - Here, just take it. - No, I don't want it. - I don't want it anymore! Okay? I don't want it anymore. No, I don't want it anymore. I don't want it anymore, I don't want it anymore! - You are just like him. - I don't want you here. Don't you get it? I begged your mother. I begged her, and I begged her, and I begged her! - Hey. Join your old man for a game of cards, okay? - No. - Oh, that's right. It was never your thing, right? - What have you done? That girl is just like her father. - You know you've made things much worse for her, right? - All this time you've been comin' here lying to me, right? You said her real mother came back for her. - I didn't want her to see you. - What, you're embarrassed of me? - No. She's just a child. - Look, I remember when she was a little baby bouncin' on my knee. We were happy. As long as the money was there. - Oh, all right, is that what this is about? - Well, I do know why you put me here. - To take care of you. - You put me here to get rid of me. I used to be your partner, remember that? That was my business. I gotta know why you shoved me to the side. You chose him. - You have two sons, not one. - One. - No, no, you've always had two. You wanna know the truth? I wanted to lock you up like a caged animal for the way you treated him all those years. - You really have no idea what I saw, what I was forced to do in that war. You never saw the things I did after. It wasn't really me. You're hating the wrong person, Peter. - You always blamed him. Something he had no control over. You couldn't be rid of it. You had to destroy our lives with it. No more. - I'm your father. - No, you're breakin' up this family. - Hey, you be back. You always come back. - No. Not this time. Theo. Theo. Theo. Theo, are you okay? You okay? Are you okay, what did you do? What are you doing with those? Did you take them? - I lost it. - It's okay, I took care of it. - What, how? - Maria's necklace. I sold it. - No. No, you shouldn't have done that. - It's always been you and me, brother. Just you and me. I thought things would be better. - Where's Luka? - I don't know. - Don't. - You wanna talk? - Don't you think it's a little late for that? Why did you give me away? - It's complicated. - So where's my real mother? - She was young. She wasn't ready for a baby. She left you at the hospital. Hey, I don't know where she is. - Did you love my mother? - I saw the sign that you made. Why didn't you tell me? - I tried. You never listen to me. - Well, I am now. - I don't want you in my life. - No. - You ruin everything. You even made Cari leave. - No, please, I'm sorry. - Don't you want me? - Yes, of course I do. - Then why did you give me to Peter? - Better life for you. Away from you? - I couldn't give you what you needed. Luka, I love you. - Don't leave. - Never again. I promise. Promise. I'm here now, I'm not going anywhere, okay. Lately, my father and I have been taking the boat out. We swim in the deep waters. At times, when I can't seem to catch my breath, I look over and he is there.
