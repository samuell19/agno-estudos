Good morning, everyone. Morning. Good morning. This is quite a crowd today for a weekday service. Is that something to do with your recruiting, Steven? I do what I can. Associate Pastor Steven Cooper would like to make some announcements before we start the service. Good morning, everyone. Good morning. As Father Otto said, a bit of a crowd for a weekday mass. Maybe that's 'cause preseason football is starting on Sunday, right? So anyway, onto our announcements. Church of St. Anthony's is going to be working in collaboration with other Christian churches in order to help the unfortunate victims, the Christian victims who were part of the protest a few weeks ago-- So on behalf of those victims, St. Anthony's thank you for your donation. Typically, Father Bartholomew would be holding this charity, but he has not been feeling that well. But not to worry. He will be feeling better soon. You. You in the back there. I'm going to ask you to leave. Of course. That's what Christians do to those that are different. Johnny? Johnny, is that you? The new me. After you and Father Bartholomew cast me out. This is not the appropriate time-- Go to hell! I'm sorry, but you preach about love and acceptance, and you judged me. Cast me out for doing nothing wrong. And then when I found a group of people who accepted me as I am, you exiled them from town just like you exiled me from the church. Well, it's like our leader, the Master, says, a purge for a purge. You couldn't remember to get gas after the movies last night, huh? Not a great way to start your first day as a clergyman, buddy. I'm pretty sure this whole carpool thing is not going to be a great idea. If anything, a carpool.. Father? Get over to the church right away. Yeah, I'm here. Paul. Paul. What? They're here. The name of the Father and Son and the Holy Spirit. Don't kill him. Don't kill him. Paul-- Paul and Johnny are here, Father. Paul and John-- Paul and Johnny-- Finally. Guys, help Father Otto. I'm going to stay here. I'm going to make sure there's no other survivors that need my help. Steve is in there with that man. Go help him out. But Father-- Go help him now! What's wrong, Johnny? Sir, look at what we did. What you did here is for our people. I'm proud of you, Johnny. I am honored, Master. You're a great actor. You had them all fooled. Good work. My church. Steven, what's going on? The-- the shooter, he got away. You let him go, Steven. We saw you did. Oh. Well, that's too bad. Now I have to kill you two, as well. Is the cross weakening him? It couldn't hurt to try. We can't kill a priest. Let's just leave him here with the cops. They're take care of him. Brother Bartholomew! You thought the cross weakened me? You've seen too many vampire movies. Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil, for you are with me. Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me. Hm. Forgot your fangs. Nah. They're just cheesy. Except the Master's. 'Cause the Master's fangs are real. They're retractable. Didn't you hear the story about that guy that tried to yank the Master's fangs out of his mouth? Found they were lodged in his gums. Shit. Yeah. See, the Master, he's the real deal. A true vampire. You really believe that? According to urban myth, he's centuries old. That's why he talks so weird. He's traveled the world for years, picking up different accents. He's a true immortal. If that's true, then how come he doesn't make us immortals? We have to prove ourselves first. Starting with you. We're going to deliver what's left of you to him. Untie the girl now. You should've worn a mask, hero. I never forget a face. Normally you'd be right, see, but I don't need to wear a mask for this mission. What do you mean? Because none of you are getting out of here alive. Let her down slowly. Back away. Step back. Go in peace. Serve the Lord. I am the vengeance of the Lord and the vengeance of His temp-- Shit! Michael, look out! You're going to blow your cover. I was trying to help. I don't need your help. Vampire hunter! Get out of my club! This is a mess. That was really risky. Fancy seeing you here, vampire hunter. Don't worry. After tonight, you're not going to see me again because I'm going to take your other eyeball. You OK, man? Thanks. Fuck. We gotta get we gotta get out of here. The cops are on their way. My cover's blown, Michael. I told you to wait until Mark got here. I know things got crazy. I'm sorry. My fucking cover's blown! All right! Look on the bright side. You won't have to wear this stupid bandana anymore. Michael, you know this is fucking serious, man. I am being serious. There was a hostage in there. Where were you? We were outnumbered 10 to 1 in there. What have you been up to? Sorry, man. I was over on 12th with the Girls Fang Gang. And then I was over on 6th with the Nosferatu Vagrants. Where's everybody else? Look, they're out of town on assignment. I join them next week, and that leaves you three. What? Cool. So this has just been practice for being outnumbered for the rest of the week. You know we're getting picked off one by one, right? Hey, look, if you were nervous, I didn't need your help back in there. You could've just stood around. Really, Michael? Who's got police training and who's the seminary student? Who founded the group that you're in because the police weren't doing anything? The church knew what these freaks could do and the church started doing something about it, and the police thought we were being paranoid. Sorry if I don't trust your police training. Did you guys see the news today? What? What? Not yet. You need to watch it, 'cause it will remind you why we do this. Come on. Follow me to my car. I'll show you what I'm talking about. Sensitive viewers, please be aware. The image is disturbing. Welcome to the Dungeon, where we keep the rest of your Christian brethren. You are here because you voted with the church to take away our rights. Well, you know what happens when you take away our religious freedom? We take away yours! Unless, of course, you would like to renounce your Christian faith. Go to hell. We're already there. I don't know what's more sickening, the fact that he can get off torturing these people, or the fact that he's pretending to be an associate pastor at my church. And no one else is onto him. Just me. He knows, though. God. And he hasn't come after me because he likes playing these little games. Why don't we just-- We can't. He's too high profile. I've heard he can't be killed, anyway. Enough with this nonsense. Vampires in real life are freaks with fake fangs who watch too many vampire movies, even this guy. The reason we can't kill Associate Pastor Stephen Cooper is because then we will become criminals on the run. So somehow, we have to expose him for who he really is. Then we can nail him to the wall, for our sake and everybody else's. And we thank you, God, for gathering us all here today in group prayer for your church. And for all of your people, all of the Christians that are being held hostage by the vampires. Please, please, God. Please watch over them. And their families. Yes. They must be in such a profound state of suffering. Give them strength in their suffering, the same way that you gave your only son, Jesus Christ, strength when he was on the cross. And give us strength to defeat these freaks that have caused us so much pain. Freaks. Yes. Please, uh-- please help us to do this as a community, rather than relying on the vampire hunters, a group of vigilantes who has taken the law into their own hands and has tarnished the reputation of the church by their methods. Yes, help us find other ways, God, please. Steven's foundation. Yes, such a great cause. You've not only saved my life, but the life of so many others, Steven. You were there for us on that horrible day. And you are now. Finally, God, we ask that you help us to see the evil in our midst, wolves disguised in sheep's clothing, infiltrating flocks around-- Yes. Please, God, help protect us from the wolves. And now let's take a moment of silent prayer. Amen. Amen. Amen. Hey, James, call me so we can discuss the plan for tonight. Remember that? Anyways, look, I'm jogging behind the church. I can meet you at headquarters. Just remember, tonight is our most important mission. Tonight we take down Steven Cooper. Well, hello there. I think we are free to talk now. So tell me, why would you run away? I just felt like maybe we were going a little too far. The violence and the attacks on the church. Do you remember what the church did to you? I lost my job at the seminary. They excommunicated you when they found out that you were gay. Yes. And this is the type of church that you want to defend. I don't discriminate against my disciples. We embraced you. Remember how the men embraced you when I brought you to the Dungeon? Yes. Yes. Yes. I want you to kill whoever is behind that rock. Let me give you drink first to remind you who you really are. Now. Dos svidaniya! Hey, man. Are you OK? Are you bleeding? Hey! What-- what the fuck are you doing? It's the Master. Get off me! Sir, help me! Hey! Agh! Ugh. Do you have any idea who you're fucking with? Do you? Oh, shit. It's you. You're Michael from St. Anthony's. I remember you. You're one of those vampire hunters. No, don't call the police. You OK? Ung. Yeah. You saved my life. You're welcome. Sir, are you really one of those vampire hunters I heard about in the news? Yes. And we have to go. The man that sent this guy to kill you, he's going to send more people. So come with me. Please. Elliot, listen. A girl just found out I'm a vampire hunter. She saw my face. I lied to her so she wouldn't tell anyone. I said, the man who sent this guy to kill you, he's going to send more people, so come with. Please It was bad. It sounded like shit. I don't know. I'm going to keep lying to her, I guess, until I figure something out. OK? All right. Talk to you later. Hey, Mark, listen. A girl just found out I'm a vampire hunter. Hello, vampire hunter. Hello? Mark. Mark is unavailable right now, but I'll be sure to give him the message. Shit. Oh, my God. Blood? Wait in the car, OK? I'll be there in just a second. I promise. James, where are you? Mark is dead. They've killed you, too, haven't they? What-- what are we do-- Take me home. I thought you were going to take me home. Hey, hey, hey. It's OK. It's OK. Relax, all right? Please. This is very important to me, OK? Don't go anywhere. God, please send someone, something. Listen, I want to help. That's very sweet of you, but I can't let you help me. You're just a kid. I know it's dangerous, but I won't, I don't know, be jumping in front of bullets for you or anything, but I want to help. Something behind the scenes. Whatever I can do, I-- The best way you can help-- You saved my life. --me right now is go sit safely in the car. Please. Didn't you just ask God for someone to help you? I'm here. I'm an atheist, but if I were you, I'd take that as a sign. OK. We got a lot of things to talk about in the car, OK? OK. Steven Cooper? He's holding an annual fundraiser tonight for the shooting that he caused at my church a year ago, and I have to be there. How can you even stand to be in the same room as him? Penance. So what do you want me to do? I need you to steal his laptop. His laptop? Yeah. His laptop, while he's distracted, is going to be the only thing that has incriminating evidence on him that's going to hold up in court. So if you can get it, we can nail him. "Thessalonians 2:4 says the man of sin shall sit in the house of God. Michael! Steven. It's so good to see you, man. You, too. My eyes are deceiving me. Michael Collins, seminary student, celibate, brings himself a date to dinner? Oh, no, no. No, no, no, no. She's my sister, Vivian. Oh. This is our associate pastor, Steven Cooper. Sister. Nice to meet you. So nice to meet you, too, Vivian. I don't remember you mentioning a sister before, Michael. Yeah, I talked about it. Are you adopted, Viv? You don't bear much resemblance to Michael. Um-- Yeah, she is, but-- Oh, yeah, sorry about that. Yeah. We did bring you some red wine. Thought you might like that. Thank you so much. I love red. Of course. Yeah, I figured you might. Can we come inside and listen to some of the other guests? Please, come on in. Welcome to my humble abode. Love what you've done with the place. Here, let me take your coats. Yeah. Where, uh-- where is everybody else? Everybody else? Well, the party goers, it said on your invitation that the party started at 6:00. Oh. So that's why you guys are here early. But you guys are-- oh, shoot, I must have given you the wrong invitation. I had an invitation that said 6:00. I thought I'd thrown that one out. It was a typo. Oh. I must have sent it to you. Everyone else is coming at 7:00. That's why you guys are here. I'm so sorry about that. We were afraid we were going to be fashionably late. Well, still fashionable, but definitely very early. But it's OK. It'll give us a chance to catch up a little, right? Yeah. You know what, though? Vivian said she needed to use the bathroom, so we could just go do that-- Oh, no I don't. I'm fine. No, it's OK. You said in the car that coffee just runs right through you. Don't be-- don't be embarrassed. Everybody has to go sometime. They do. Everyone does have to go sometime. I mean, I can show you where the bathroom-- Oh, Steven, it's OK. You have a whole house to set up. Let me-- let me show her where the bathroom is. I know where it's at. It's fine. Yeah, yeah. We'll talk soon. Mhm. What's going on? It's a setup. What? I don't even think the other guests are coming. He invited us here early so he can kill us. I need you to go through this guestroom out that window. There's our car, OK? I need you to get out of here. Wait. Maybe he just made a mistake on the invitation. Yeah, maybe he did. And maybe he's just waiting to bury our bodies before everybody shows up, all right? Look, if he wants to have a showdown, that's fine, but I can't have you here. I can't have him hurt anybody else. I can't have him hurt you. You saved my life. Look, I appreciate that, but I signed up for this, OK? If you really want to help me, you're going to to my car and you're going to call for help, OK? OK. Thank you for everything. Now go. The window. Hi! Hi. Sorry about that. She just-- she's really sick. She needed to lie down. She's getting faint, you know? Oh, jeez. Can I get her some water? No. You know what? She just needs to take a rest. That's totally fine. Oh. OK. Yeah, well, hey, how about till then, why don't we have some of that wine that you brought? Yeah, that sounds great. I actually poured us a couple glasses. Oh, you did? Looks like it'll be some good wine. Yeah, it should be good. So uh, what did you want to talk about? You know, I actually wanted to cheers first. Cheers first. Very good. Mhm. Here. Have a seat. I've actually been thinking of incorporating the Acts of Peter as a little bit more inspiration for me in my sermons. Father Bartholomew taught me all about the Acts of Peter. Remember him? Of course I remember him. It was so tragic what happened to him. Mhm. I'm sure God will find a way to exact His revenge somehow. I'm sure He will. Do you own a dog? A dog? Do you own a dog? Because of the little bed right there? That's-- no, no, no. Remember the Deacon Richard? He and his wife and their family, they moved out of the house, and you know, they went on that mission trip. They left a lot of their stuff. I'm still clearing it out. Kind of embarrassing. So anyway, you remember, then, in the Acts of Peter Simon the Sorcerer, right? Simon was using all of his sorcery to lure Christians away to follow a false religion. And Peter hated his deception so much and shared a contest with Simon, a contest in front of a lot of people, to prove whose powers were truly divine and whose were sorcery. Did you hear about that? Of course. Did you hear about how Simon levitated above the ground? And then Peter prayed to God that Simon would be struck down to prove to everyone that he was a fake? That's interesting, right? That he'd prayed to God to strike a man down. Does that sound very Christian? Well, sometimes good people have to do bad things when they're fighting evil. That is true. And maybe there is where the line between God's disciples and the forces of evil becomes a lot less clear, don't you think? You know what, Steven? From where I'm sitting, our lines are pretty fucking clear. You do know I'm going to kill you tonight, right? You think so? Yeah, I know so. And your, um, "sister," too. Not if I kill you first. Agh. You are out of your league. B-positive blood. Ironic, isn't it, Michael? Not much to be positive about now, is there? You know what's ironic, Steven? You. You're sipping my blood out of a wine glass. What, have you forgotten how to use those good old-fashioned fangs of yours? Or no. You've been playing at that classy, respectable act so long, you've forgotten what you really are deep down inside, haven't you? Oh, that's OK, because deep down, you know. Deep down, we all know what you really are. You're just a fucking freak. Pathetic. I have hard times, Michael. I have a little home video I've prepared for us. Let's watch. You are-- were a vampire hunter, yes? James. Vampire hunters are Christian hypocrites. No. The vampire hunters are just soldiers. They have to pick up the sword of God's spirit to defeat Satan's evil. Funny you should mention sword, because that is what we may use on you. The draining of your blood. No! Unless, of course, negotiations can be made for my people's rights. They'll never negotiate with you! Hey, hey, hey, hey. Conversation is over. You were rude to me. What? You interrupted me. Get him out of my sight! What? Feed from him! Feed from him. Oh, no! No! Get up. Turn around and face me, Michael. You give me one good reason I shouldn't kill you right now. I'll give you two, actually. One, James is still alive. And two, I'm going to kill you first. They're gone, Steven. Vivian, don't. Tell me where James is now! You really convinced me, Michael. Tell me where the innocent churchgoers are now. Ask nicely. You don't understand. This is me asking nicely. What? You're going to shoot me when the guests are at the door? They'll see you killing their beloved associate pastor? Come on, Michael. Let's prepare for the guests. We can finish the exciting stuff later. Come on. Put it away. Shit. Ow! Ow! Gentle. Hey! Steven, hello! Everyone! Hi, buddy. Aw, it's great to see you. Great to see you. Michael! Oh, you know it's always a pleasure.. This is my sister, Vivian. Thank you for being here. It's so nice to meet you. Good to see you. Oh, another. Floyd, good to see you. Oh, you guys have met? Yeah. This is my sister. His sister, Vivian. I've been sick all weekend. I've actually taken a tumble down the stairs yesterday. That's why-- Looks like you were in the back seat of a car and someone dog ran across-- Yeah, right. No, it was bad. Actually, that's why Vivian came down. To take care of me. She dressed me up tonight and got me looking good, but I am officially so under the weather. Great sister. Wow. So I've actually-- She's just as sweet as you are looking right now. I know I missed the last potluck, but I feel like-- Yeah, Michael. He's been a little MIA lately. I know. I know. I think I should take off till I get some rest. Oh, no, no, no. I think-- --breathing-- I really think you should stay. I mean, this is really important tonight. Well, I wouldn't want to-- Steven. Vivian, please take the man home. Obviously, he's not feeling well. We should go. Come on, Steven. We want to have a nice party. Right. We don't want to get sick all over the place. It was an honor to see you guys. And I'll see you at the next potluck. It was nice to meet you, Vivian. Floyd, good to see you. Travel safe tonight. Yes, thank you. Put some ice on that nose to save your.. Have a safe night. OK. OK? Bye, you guys. See you next-- Step on it, Jeeves. Well, that's just terrible, poor guy, what he's going through. Well, let the fun night begin, everyone. Yeah. Appetizers right this way. All right, Steven. I'm starving. This is wonderful. I can't believe you got Steven's laptop. Why would a criminal mastermind leave a paper trail on his laptop? He's getting sloppy. Why is he getting sloppy all of the sudden? His followers believe he's centuries old, the last true vampire. I mean, they believe, after centuries of life, he's finally suffering from dementia. But of course, that's absurd. They think of themselves as untouchable. And that's when they start to make mistakes. They don't realize that they're even capable of mistakes. Email. "Master, I've lost my way. I don't know how to get home. Please pick me up. I'm headed to the refuge." I know where this guy is. And he knows where the other Christians are being held. I'm going to make him give me the location of the Dungeon. Why would Steven be calling? To deliver another villainous monologue. I'm not going to get him the satisfaction. Are you screening my calls? Call me. What's wrong, sir? What makes you think something's wrong? I saw you with the guest, and you look a bit out of sorts. You don't think any of them are onto me, do you? No. Don't worry. You put on quite a show. I just know you. That you do, Miss Blank. Michael got away. Why not just send someone to kill him? I can do it, if you don't mind serving the guest for a while. No one can kill him but me. Do you understand? It needs to be at my hands and nobody else's. You really are getting crazier lately. What did you say? Please don't cut me again. You will unleash the Destroyer. Tell him to bring me Michael alive. He's a psycho you found on the streets with rabies. You'd be surprised how much rabies patients and vampires of folklore have in common. Sensitivity to light, extreme aggression, and a highly infectious bite. The disease of madness, some say. Master says the vampire hunter is probably at the refuge right now to interrogate Johnny. You need to go there now. But remember, do not kill Michael. The Master wants Michael for himself. I can't believe he chose you over me. I didn't sign up to be some server just serving at all these damn dinner parties. So don't fuck this up because if you do, the Master will have your head for it. And with any luck, maybe he'll find you capable of performing the decapitation. Wait. Michael, let's hear him out. He might be telling the truth. You do know he's the one that went all Nosferatu on you in the canyon, right? Hey, I was just following orders. Yeah, I heard your orders. I also heard your boss say he took you to the Dungeon. Now, spill it. I didn't look back and see the surroundings. Why wouldn't you look back? Have you seen the fucked up shit that goes on in there? If you want information, go to the corner of 5th and Market Street, Club V, the vampire club. You and your pals were there a while back, and so you gotta go undercover. Sheriff is right down that way, so just bring this into them and tell them why you're here, OK? OK. Good luck. Thanks. I told you to get out of here before I change my mind! Where is the vampire hunter? Where is he? Where-- I'm one of you! I'm one of you! I'm one of you! I work for you guys. I work for the Master. Master says you're a f-- fuck-up! Fuck-up! Fuck-up! Fuck him, then! I'm not telling you nothing! No! No! No! No! What? Can I freshen any of your drinks? Oh, yeah. Absolutely. Thank you. Great. You-- you got-- you good? Yeah, I got it. Thanks, guys. Yeah. You sure? , Steven. Thank you. I will come right back for you guys. Sorry. OK. That's wonderful. Take your time, Steven. Thanks, Father Otto. But not too much time. You don't want to hold up dinner. Floyd! Oh, Floyd. Oh, man. I'll be right back, all right, guys? You have 12 unheard messages. Quit screening my fucking calls. Jesus! Listen, I hoped I wouldn't have to resort to blackmail to stop you from turning in my laptop, but you forced my hand. Does this sound familiar to Michael? You lunatic! You opened fire on dozens of unarmed civilians in a fucking dance club! You're a fucking psychopath. I love it! I'm playing the video again. I'm playing it again. So good. You are so going down. Michael, what are you doing? Shh! What are you doing here? I can't show the evidence to the police. What are you talking about? Because the police are corrupt. I just found out that Steven has them in his pocket. Oh, my God. Yeah. You're not safe here, OK? You're only safe with me. Come on. with you. Master! Did you finally get him? I think. I want Michael's head to be filled with Christian love and hope. Yeah. Yeah. OK. OK, yeah. Well, you take care, Richard. You're here with us in spirit. Don't worry about it. OK. He's good. Bye. Sorry about that, guys. Sorry. That was Richard. Oh. We were just-- That's-- We were just talking. You know, he was calling from the mission trip and everything. That's totally-- Wonderful. --fine. I-- Sounds like Richard's doing a great work. Yeah. Yes, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah, he's-- he's humbled by all the things he's been able to do for those kids in Darfur. Oh. Um, I thought it was Uganda. Yeah, didn't you say Uganda? I thought so, also. Did I hear that wrong? Y-- yeah! Uganda, of course. Oh! OK. That's what I meant. The wine must be getting to me. Speaking of wine-- I've never seen Steven drink this much. --I thought you were going to freshen up our drinks. Oh, yes. It-- it's OK. We-- No. We can get our own. That's fine. That's-- it's fine. Actually, I've been chilling all of your drinks. Thank you so much. Except-- yeah. Yeah. All the drinks are chilling except for you guys, so I'm going to go get those for you, OK? OK. Thank you. Is that OK, Floyd? Thank-- OK. It's fine. It's fine with me. Thanks. That was weird. I-- Was it actually-- Well, if you'll excuse me, I think I'd better go talk to Steven. I think you better do that, Father. Great. That's a good idea. I know this really isn't your scene, but you have to try to blend in. Wait in the car, all right? Wait in the car? I shouldn't have brought you in here in the first place. It was too dangerous. I can't-- It's not a big deal. I can stay. I can't. I can't do it. If something were to happen to you-- You what? This is too dangerous. Just please wait in the car. Fine. Mother, are you watching me right now? Looking over me from heaven? Because I need your help. I keep dreaming of you, Mother, and in my dream, you keep telling me not to attack the church. But why not? Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. What's wrong, baby? Look, Buzz, I actually work for the Master. He told me I was take these guys to the Dungeon early and he forgot to tell me the address. So just give me the address and I'll take them, yeah? First you gotta prove you are who you say you are. What are you doing? You're not gonna shoot me, Buzz. What side are you on? Agh! Tell me where the fucking Dungeon is. The Masters says dead is nothing. Yeah? Hey. You want me to shoot her, too? I miss you, Mama. You died protecting me from the Christians. The Christians that you said would accept me. You told me we are all God's children. She just helped save one of your people. And yet, your last words were, forgive them. Father Bartholomew, what are-- I knew there was something off about you, Steven. What are you talking about? I had a camera set up in your office. The Dungeon is Steven's garage. Now let her go. Shh! The guests are trying to enjoy their desserts. Fucking hiding in plain sight. Hey, are you OK? No, wait. Why the fuck has anyone done that? No! No! Michael! Michael! No! No! Giving up so soon, Timmy? Come on. I'm not Timmy! No! No! No! No! I will not erase this video because it's a reminder of how compassion makes me weak. I'm sorry. Hey, has anybody seen Father Otto? No. Oh, he had to go. He-- he was feeling-- he was looking a little pale. Awful. OK. Is he all right? Oh, he'll be fine. He'll-- you know, he's in peace now. He's doing all right. He's fine. Awful. Seems a lot of people have been getting sick lately. Mhm. What are you, um-- what are you implying, Floyd? Just trying to say it's obvious that people are getting sick and-- Mhm? It's just everyone seems to be getting this flu bug. And it's keeping people down. It is keeping people down, Floyd. It can kill people. So we should probably not talk about it while we're eating. OK. Good. We should change subjects here. I hear that there's going to be a full moon tonight. Oh, really? I love full moons. Steven. You, uh-- you forgot to close the garage door on the side. No, I didn't. You did. And do you the key so I can go lock it? Are you serious? I really-- I really forgot to close the side? Really, Miss Blank? Uh, let me check here. Goddamn it. I don't have the key. I don't have the key. I don't know where I left it. Well, Jesus Christ, just lock it from the inside. It's not that simple, Floyd. I'm bored with this. I'm going to go try to find it. I should probably go help her, you guys. Sorry. It's outside. I-- I don't-- I don't trust, you know. people can just get in and attack if you don't lock it up, right? Right. Charles Manson and stuff. Yeah. Yeah. OK. Yeah. I'll be right back. Sorry. Right. OK. That's kind of, um-- Very interesting. We cannot have anyone getting inside the garage, understand? Or getting out, like her. Help! Help! It's OK. Help! Put her with the others. Vivian! What are you doing? Let's go. I heard Steven's voicemail. Are you trying to hide the fact that you killed all those innocent people? Vampires. People. That did nothing wrong except be at the wrong place at the wrong time. It was an accident. And one that you tried to cover up. I'm sorry I lied to you. Take my car. Go to the police station. You give them Steven's laptop and you expose him like I should have done. If my sins are exposed along with Steven's, so be it. Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil. Come on, Michael. Come on. Come on. Pick up. Pick up. Pick up. Michael. Michael, I gave the laptop to the police. It'll take a while before they can get the arrest warrant for Steven, but look, I know you're not going to wait for them, but will you please wait for me? I'm coming now. Don't go in alone. Is it another escapee from the Dungeon? Escapee? No, I work for Steven. The Master. I'm on-- I'm on your team. Michael? What? Whoa! Listen, lady. I don't want to have to use this, but I will, all right? What a gentleman. Agh. I win. We pray for compassion for them, as Christ taught us to do, and for those that have harmed us, that they be forgiven, for they know not what they've done. Amen. Amen. Amen. Doesn't someone live on 5th Aven-- Don't trust them. Michael, don't save us. James. James. Please don't hurt me. Please don't make me hurt them anymore, either. I-- I never wanted to hurt anyone. Kill them all. Kill them all. Kill them all. Miss Blank! The guests are waiting for their desserts. Sorry. Good help is so hard to find these days. I'll get your desserts. Oh. I'll get it. Hello, sir. I know it's a tad bit late, but have you been saved by the Lord, Jesus Christ, yet? Let me think about that. Come out here. Let's talk about it. James. James! So it's getting-- Listen. I can't understand-- This guy's totally, totally gone, no telling. He's all skittish and everything. And apparently, he can't get the chandelier to work. Really? I mean, what's the deal with?? This is really weird. It's very strange. I don't understand. It's getting really weird. Father Otto just disappeared. Let's just go, you guys. I'm going to get my purse and go. Hey, guys. Sorry about that. Bible salesman. You can never have too many, though, right, as an associate pastor, so. Oh, my God! This isn't what it looks like. Steven! Shut up! Everyone, just shut up. All of you, silence! I suppose I cannot keep this from you any longer. It's a shame. I really have enjoyed being associate pastor Steven Cooper, respected citizen. I am the vampire, Mastermind. What? Are you laughing? Floyd, are you laughing? This is not a joke. I'm laughing at you. Some Mastermind. You can't even hold together a simple dinner party. Ah, respected citizen. We never respected you. We don't even like you. You're pathetic! You're a freak. Come on. Just don't stand there. Let's go! James, you're safe. James. Get the fuck out of my face! James, it's me! James, what did they do to you? The Master, he helped me realize. The Master? No. No, no, no. The Destroyer infected you with rabies. Steven brainwashed you. I'm a monster. Just like them. No. None of us are monsters. Michael? James. James! Steve, you twisted son of a bitch! You think you found the Dungeon? There are hundreds of Dungeons. Torture rooms for Christians hiding across the country. You'll never find all of them. Meet me inside soon. I'm just saying my goodbyes to the guests. All the shit we did was for nothing! That's not true! Vampire hunter, if you want to get to the Master, you gotta go through me first. And her. Please, I never meant to hurt anyone. Please have mercy on me. Can you kill an innocent to get to the Master? None will stand in the way of God's will again. You did exactly what the Master wanted. You proved you were a monster. Just like him. Bitch! For giving into fornication and going after strange flesh, thou shall be an example, suffering the eternal vengeance of eternal fire. I just want to go home! Shh. To do righteousness and justice is far more acceptable to the Lord than to sacrifice. Michael, what are you doing? Oh! Vivian. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Oh, my God! Oh, my God. I failed. Vampire hunter! I am gonna bring Michael to the Master! I'm gonna bring Michael to Master. I'm gonna bring Michael to the Master. Ow! I'll take Michael to Master. Clean it up. And grab an arm. Michael, come right this way. You don't look well. Let me get you some water. Maybe some coffee. You're probably tired. I cleaned this place up so we could have our final, epic battle here before-- Sir, he's dead. What? No, no, no. He's-- Michael's dead, but I brought him here so you can claim your prize. What good is a prize, Miss Blank, if you have to get it from the fucking prize store? Goddamn it! So is this the great angel, Michael? This is what it all comes down to? What should I do with the girl? What? Oh. Kill her. Whatever. I don't care. No. Steven, there's good inside you. Please don't let her do this. I saw that there's good inside you. Good inside me? Put her in the Dungeon. No. No, please. No, please. He let him live. No, I'm really not. Vivian. You can thank Michael for finding this handy little rope earlier. Now I can use it on you. No! How will society react when they find out that their associate pastor was really the vampire Mastermind all along? It's better, isn't it, Miss Blank? The Christian church has been turning people away from it for years. Christians will protest funerals. Anti-abortionists who resort to murder. Politicians who see no line between church and state. I'm just giving society the little push it needs to turn them into an anti-Christian frenzy! The genocides will be unstoppable. Genocide? World history is made when the minority in number represents the majority of will and determination. Eventually, every last crucifix will be paid in blood. And it sure as hell won't be Christ. Miss Blank, let's indoctrinate the girl. No! No! Miss Blank. Natalie. I wanted to say thank you for everything tonight. You were the calm water to my raging fire. The one person who stood by me, with all of the craziness and I wanted to thank you. It's my honor, Master. Stupid bitch. Stupid, stupid, stupid bitch. Why did you make me do that? I didn't want to do that to you. But you were against my plans for genocide. I'm sorry, Master. You're still here. I put some drugs in the blood that I just fed you. The side effects may include hallucinations. But rest assured, most of the horrors you see down here are quite real. Welcome to the Dungeon. I'm not gonna hurt you. I untied you. And the white dress that you're wearing, it belonged to one of the many who were killed here. I clothed you in it to remind you what you're fighting for-- the Christians and the vampires who no longer want you. That key? Miss Blank dropped the key when the Master killed her. You need to take the key and open the door. You're fighting for innocence. I'm dreaming. No one can stop us. No! Oh, no! Oh, God! Oh, no. Hey, remember us? Michael's victims. Do you think, deep down, God hates you? Do you think, deep down, your religious family hates you, for being an atheist? Oh, they love me. Stop! Stop! Stop! Please forgive him. Please forgive him. Please-- please forgive him. And yet, your last words were, forgive them. Hey, are-- are you OK? You want to come with me? Don't you understand, Vivian? There's nothing left to say. No! This is the only thing that will kill me. Pierce through my heart, Vivian. Do it. Do it! Members of the congregation, if I cannot prove a lover, I am determined to prove a villain. Bloody, thou art. Blood will be thy end. Stupid cunt. He watched you, freak! Free! No! No! Ow. you doing fucking you doing? Get up! You come into my home? You bitch! You tried to stop me? There is no stopping me, fucking.. You bitch! You interfered! Huh? You're not a monster. You think you can appeal to my soul. I don't have one. What, Mother? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Well, well, we-- wha-- what? Why? After everything I did to you. Answer me, goddamn it! I forgive. I'm sorry. You're sorry. All of you. Shoot me. Just do it. Just do it! Shoot me! No. No! Fuck! Fucking thing.
