There's a cycle for everything in this world. Time has a cycle. Weather has a cycle. Every organism has a food chain cycle. Well, even the piece of paper that we mint out, for which everyone goes crazy is called the same, Chakaram (Money). Did you know, in this world, which was cluelessly spinning, the most greatest invention of all time, which transformed human life significantly, was also called, Chakaram (Wheel). Gautham. Hurry up. - Where were you? - I was coming here. Where's the key? Oh no! I forgot to take it. Go and get it fast. Is that Molushi? Ramendran from Palakkad, a gentle and kind soul, and moreover the only postmaster for this remote village; was my father, and it is here, in his ancestral home, that me, Gautham, spent the first 10 year's of his life. Sreenu, I can't find my cycle's keys. Its should be there. Just check there itself. I had put it on top of the cupboard yesterday. Dad, here are the keys. Where you out spinning the wheel this early. Dada's Gautham. Tell him. Dad, please bring honey candy when you come. Why not? How many do you want? - How many? - Three. Three. Does one person need three candies? This kid! Raman, don't waste your money. Dada will bring it. But let's not give granny any. Then you needn't buy any. You may leave. I will buy it mom, you don't worry. Your blood sugar will shoot up. Granny, used to be my best buddy there. Every evening, granny used to tell me epics from mythology. What an epic! In order to kill baby Krishna, Sakadasuran came rushing toward's him. I used to gulp down mom's rice and sambar listening to granny’s epic thrillers. And for the war of Mahabharata, on a chariot drawn by 7 horses, Krishna and Arjun, race towards the battlefield. Of all of granny's stories, I liked Krishna's. Aren't there supposed to be 7 horses? Over here, we have only 2. The remaining 5 are out grazing. Because he was the one riding. She occasionally used to take a break from epics, and used to say a real life story. Back in the day, my Raman's father, your grandfather, when he used to drive his car from Ceylon (Sri Lanka), he used to have a handful of honey candy, and used to take me out for a drive in his car. Gautham, have you ever been inside a car? Lambi car! If there's ever a car, that's the car. The man who drive's it, that's the man. Eh? He used to bring your grandfather from, Ceylon to Palakkad, without any damage whatsoever. If he was there today, there would have been a car in our driveway. The car that was driven from Ceylon to Palakkad. Got it? Catching a glimpse of the Ambassador car that came to our neighbour Ousepettan's house sowed the seeds of love in my heart. And like any boy, my first love too was car. Oh, wish I could even get inside an Amby car. That's when, dad got transferred from Palakkad to Cochin. So finally, an Amby car came to my ancestral home's driveway too. That day, I was really excited about getting in the car for the first time.. As a souvenir of Palakkad's memories, we loaded dad's One cycle, and drove into a new life in Cochin, in a car. ♪ Hip hip hurray. Hurray hip hip. ♪ ♪ Hip hip hurray.

Granny, granny. Granny, do you need silk candy. Give me some, please give me some. Bug off. I am leaving. Back in the day, when your grandfather came by car from Ceylon to Palakkad.. Granny, I have told you many times that you can no longer fool me with this dumb story of yours. See old lady. I have got brains now. - Okay? - Oh! Since when do yo have this brain? Only after my Ramendran was born, right? Listen, whatever it is, not just grandpa, but no one can drive from Sri Lanka to here. You and your dumb stories. There's a big ocean between India and Sri Lanka. My dear genius, you are wrong. Your grandfather came here using the Rama Sethu (Adam's bridge) built by Lord Ram and Hanuman. Granny, Ramasethu exist's only in the mythology. That doesn't exists now. Get lost. Whatever Lord Ram has built, will never cease to exist. Then, I have got news for you. All of it got washed away, a long time ago. There's no use talking to you, silly boy. Isn't the Ramasethu debate over yet? Mom, she doesn’t get it. 80 years of age, but what's the use of it, don't have the any sense at all. Mom, do you know, while I was in 5th grade, I boasted this story in school and got mocked for it till 12th grade, by being called Hanuman. Oh... Hanuman. The son of Marut. The immortal one. Vayu.. Give me back my Silk. You have had enough. Move... Move aside. Why? Why are you hiding it? Let you students see what their spiritual teacher was up to? No wonder you have this tremor in your hands. It's because you say such eye-popping lies. Here, hold it. This is because I killed a cat while I was a kid. That's why I have these tremors. Oh, is it? And it has nothing to do with your age? Oh, not at all. Here, just hold me. Wow, you haven't even aged a day. Hey, get off my back you silly boy. - Oh, is it? - Hey Gautham, open up. After moving out to Cochin, when granny's stories started to do re-run's, to escape from that, I arranged the kids from the neighborhood for her. Little did I know, that it would evolve into a weekly Purana Class and without any shame, that my bestie Venkedi will also join. Payasam. Behave. And that's how Krishna's moral advice helped. All of a sudden, Karnan's chariots wheels got stuck in the battle field. Knew it, this is what happens, when you make battlefields over sinkholes. Can you just be quiet? Venkedi, to whom are you lecturing communism? She is the one, who supports those who built road by filling the sea? These ignorant children. Gautham, don't dare to say a word more about Adam's bridge. Adam's bridge doesn't exist, doesn't exist, doesn't exist. - Whatever, granny continue with you story. After Karnan's vehicle's wheel got stuck, then? This is enough for today. Spoiled my mood completely. You kid's go and come back after a week. - Nobody leave. - Where are you all to, like small kids? Sit down, have got a surprise. Isn't it Payasam? - Mom, do you want it now? - No. Isn't it Payasam? I got the smell of it. Have it? I will have the big glass. Take whichever one you want. Hey, how was today's story session? The story got stuck along with Karnan's chariot's wheel, now need to get it out of there. - Are you upset? - What's so special about today, to have Payasam? Today is Gautham's 18th birthday. Venkedi was really shocked to learn the truth. You turned 18? I feel shy to wish you, happy birthday. Oh, I almost forgot. Happy birthday. - Thank you. - Rock it. Thank you. Hey, wish me. As Venkedi stood blushing, dad had this piece of advice. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. - Gautham. - Yes dad. - My dear boy. - This is good. You are a man now. Without any delay whatsoever, you need to get a driving license. Realizing that, it was my step towards fulfilling my childhood dream, got prepared for a big battle. Dad, itself arranged my Dhronacharya (Guru) for me. Master Shibu. You are Ramettan's son? Yes. Ramettan and me, we have been friend's for years. My dad told me. That's what I am saying, don't ruin our friendship. Absolutely never, uncle. Don't uncle me. Master, that's enough. Okay master. So from tomorrow onwards, early morning 6.30. You should be on the grounds here, and not be roaming around. - Yes Master. - Yes Master. Is he also there? No Master, I will only become an adult after 2 more months. Looks like you will need more than that. My scooter, Come here, come here. Will you push my scooter to the ground? Run 10 rounds around the ground, in the 8 shape. I don't this is going to work out. So, from tomorrow onwards you are going to start running in the shape of 8. Eh? You are totally screwed. That day, I sat in the driving seat of a car for the first time. Felt my hands on the steering wheel, till my hands ached. Hey, if you touch it so softly, like it was some girls hand, you are sure to crash into somewhere. Well, I was just. So, shall I start the car? You aren't ready to start yet. I will let you know, when you are ready. So, shouldn't I drive this? Before you drive, there are a few things I need to clear with you. What is it? What is driving? Don't know? Listen, driving is an art. An art which requires your mind, body and soul. There is a method to it. You need to have flow for it. Not everyone can master it. And that's what you are going to learn from today. Okay? Okay. You need to have a few things to learn this art. Know what are those? No... Hmm. No. Note it down. Well, I don't have a book or pen on me. Damn, you ruined it. You won't get to learn this elsewhere. These are stuff that I figured out on my own. Well Master, I didn't bring it because it was the driving class. Fine, let it be. Keep these in your mind. - Don't loose it. - Never. Okay. The things that we need for driving are: 1. Patience. 2. Confidence. 3. Consciousness. 4. Concentration. 5. Compromise. If you have these five things, you can make it out alive, without getting run over by a truck. Okay? Master! You are awesome. There is a lot more to learn, my child. Is it? Alright, lets begin. Start it. What about the belt? - Put on the belt. - Oh, sorry, sorry. I forgot. Put it. Okay... Okay. - Now start it. - Oh God watch over me. Gear.. Gear. Like this? Press. Accelerator. Release. - Do you start it in gear? - Sorry..Sorry. Clutch, clutch, accelerator. Clutch, clutch, accelerator. - Tell me the A B C of the car. - This car's? Model name: Maruthi Suzuki 800 AC. Fuel type: Petrol. Engine capacity: 796 cc. Maximum torque: 69 Nm. Maximum power: 47 bhp. Predicted Mileage: 22.47 Km pl. Hey, not that. Not that. - Then? - ABC. Accelerator. Brake. Clutch. Hey, first look at the neutral, after that press the clutch slowly. Press the accelerator, press it slowly, put it in neutral. After that, slowly start it. Consciousness. Patience. Confidence. Consciousness. Then. Hey, you only need go as far as third now. - Concentration, concentration. - Concentration. Hey, patience. Confidence. Hit the breaks. Hit the breaks.... We are gonna crash. Just like that, after tons of experiments, Compromise. That day finally came. My trial by fire. Driving Test. In my granny's words, I got nervous, like the Abhimanyu who got stuck in Chakravyuha. But, with Dronacharya guiding me from outside, by the skin of my teeth, I cleared my driving test. Like Eklavya, who gifted his own thumb to his guru, Dronacharya, I gifted a bottle of Whiskey to Master Shibu, and got going from there. He got his license. - Gautham. - Yes dad. You are the one who has to take care of this family, after I am gone. In the coming future, you won't be able to make it anywhere, if you travel by cycle like me. As if, he has made it somewhere? It's not like that. In today's world, one can't live without a car. What? So, why don't we buy a car? Eh? For real. Dad! And, just like that, my dad got my heart racing once more. It's for you to choose, the car you wish to drive. Wow! "Who needs a cab, if your friend has a ride?", with that as their motto, Kichu and Alby also joined in to choose a car. We need to have car that has an opening on top, one that can fly. It needs to have a boot large enough to fit 12 case of beer. I am not allowed to drive our car, I hope I atleast get to drive yours. Honda City. How is it? This is the same car we have at home, you buy this, atleast I get to drive it that way. Look, this car goes well with our swag. - Is it? - Yeah, this is it. Please buy this. Please. This is an awesome car. If that's what you all feel, then we will fix this. Hmm, this car looks regal. This would look splendid in our driveway, - Isn't it Sreenu? - Let me see. Yeah. - Dad. - Yes. Our Alby also has the same car. - Oh. - Uncle, it's an awesome car. Power steering, power window, power bag, ADBS, has got everything. If the car crashes, a balloon will pop in the car. That's why he doesn't get to drive it. If it has balloon in it, then why don't we fix this. Let's fix it. Dad. They only have the base model at Alby's home, but we need to have the full option model. Well, full? We will go for the full portion. Full? Full, yes we will have full. Full, that's nice. That's the right thing to do. You need to buy full when buying it. By the way, how much do we need to pay upfront. Base model is around 0.8, but we will get the full option for 1. Yes, 1 million. It's a steal for 1 million. I thought it would have been 1.4, especially a Honda City, getting it for 1. When dad got scared on hearing the price of new car, that's when dad announced the name of his new drama. Never buy it fresh, always buy it used. Dad, what are you saying, buying used is not going to workout. You dad, doesn't have that kind of money, my dear. 0.8 to 1 million! We will buy a good used... Dad, used cars are trouble, it will breakdown easily. Hey, make him understand. Used cars are... it will drain our money for parts and service. We needn't fear that for new. If all of you try really hard, we will have a car with all the desired qualities in our driveway. Is this a marriage proposal or what? Exactly! - Here we go. - Bringing a car home, is like bringing a new person home. It will go on to become a symbol of the whole family. So we need to be mindful of everything, when buying it. Heard that? So, it's decided then. Dad, lets not go for an used. We will go for a new one. Just think it over. I am feeling thirsty, what's there for dinner. Porridge. - Perfect. - Then get me some. Alright then. But Venkedi's determination to find a super-car among used car's got me here. Isn't it awesome? Step away from the front, Gautham. Let me see it. Hmm, it looks really regal. Enough about it's regalness, don't spoil it when you hear the price. That's true. It costs 250,000. Can you buy it dad? In that case, we need to pay a token advance today itself. Sreenu, On agreeing to granny's condition, that the vehicle should be bought in on an auspicious day, me and Venkedi, handed over the token advance amount of 1501 to the dealer.

My son Raman and his friend, has gone to get him. Someone new is going to join, to be the symbol of our family. Like Lord Ganesha has Mushak as his vehicle, like Lord Ayyappa has tiger as his vehicle, to make my Gautham's life eventful, Gautham's chariot. And that's how, a Mahabharata War got started in our kitchen. My Mitsubishi Lancer. Hey Gautham, just hear out your dad. Why did you cheat me? This isn't what you promised me. From where did you find this? - Mom, are you in support of this. - Just hear me out. Mom, not a word. - Dad, you speak. - Let me explain. No need for that too. Get this damn car off here now. - It's not a damn car. - Give me the keys. Is it with Master? I will ask him. Master. Give me those. Not that. The keys. - Go. - Gautham. What's this my dear? Let me explain. No need, let me speak. Isn't it because you all agreed that I paid the advance for the vehicle. I really wished for it. And then you come with a bug. Granny, don't you atleast feel like saying something. It's not the bug, my dear, it's a really cute looking car. - Our Kunjuttan. - Kunjuttan? Dad, are you hearing this? Yes, my dear, what you told is entirely correct, and we all liked that car too. But, only later did I realize that we were going into a grave danger. Danger? - Hmm. - What danger? Financial danger. That's when dad told how the Lancer got magically transformed into a Nano. Shibu, this is Ramendran. What is it Ramettan? Nothing much, I have decided to buy a car. Awesome, which car, what car? Car... Car... Car.... Mitsu. Misushibu Lancer. Stop.. Stop... Stop... My dear Ramettan. Are you mad to pour money down the drain? What is it Shibu? Is there something wrong? - Ramettan. - Yeah. Driving your own car, is not like driving the car from the driving school. Before driving our own car, we need to be really experienced. We need to have a bond with car. In Ladakh, who was it that helped me drive through the twisty roads? Who was it? This bond. It's true that Gautham is my disciple, and he respects me too. But he is not experienced enough to drive his own car. He has a long way to go. To gain experience, its better that you go for a small car. - Is it? - Yes. Now Ramettan, the car that you are thinking about buying is as huge as a Patton tank. If you buy it, he is going to go cruising on it. And he is bound to crash it somewhere. And when you go for repairs, that's when you find out about it. Spare parts for this vehicle are no longer available. Is it? Master Shibu, the one who got high on my Whiskey, and screwed me from behind. Oh my teacher! Dad, then why didn't you tell me about this earlier? Master Shibu told that, let this be a surprise for you. Is this a surprise? I didn't even tell your mother. Weren't you surprised? Of course, I was really surprised. My dear, just listen your dad. When you gain a little more experience, like how Master Shibu suggested, then we will buy a new car immediately. Exactly. Gain experience, and get a new car. You have nothing to fear, just remember what I taught you. You have all my blessings. - Master, - Yes. Wouldn't someone die, even if they get run over by a Nano car? I need to go somewhere immediately. Here, accept this. Give it to him. Don't be silly. Hold it. Bye then. It's a big deal, what you have done Shibu. This four legged beast that came into my house, shattering all my hopes, slowly started to take up my place in the family. For dad, he became dad's favorite plaything. I am leaving. There's no one to pamper me like this. Mom, where is the shampoo? But it was mom's name for him, that stuck. Move. Shibu asked to bathNanappan with shampoo. Even granny too had shifted her allegiance and he became her Kunjuttan. Kunjuttan, did you have your bath? Now, you will look really smart, if you go to the temple. Granny has kept a gift for you. Sonny, please wait. From now on, you don't have to hurl the newspaper, you can fold and keep it like this. That's enough. So, there are such advantages too of buying a car. Yes, it's good to have ones own car. You owe us a treat. It's better if you say it. I can't, you say it. Didn't you agree to say it? Hey, we were all kind of waiting for you. My wish is to get our Kunjuttan baptized in Guruvayoor. Baptize? Well, to bless Kunjuttan's keys from there. That, we can do. But, we are not going there anytime soon. Well, we need to go there. There's a function happening there. Tomorrow, at our family home in Guruvayoor, it's Rajeevan's daughters ear piercing ceremony. Don't you remember Uncle Rajeevan? So what? So, tomorrow all of us go to Guruvayoor tomorrow with Nanappan, and while we are there, we get Nanappan's keys blessed. To have your keys blessed in front of Lord Guruvayoor Appan, well what can I say, Kunjuttan is really lucky. Oh my Lord Guruvayoor Appan. Dad, I can't come tomorrow, I have got other plans for tomorrow. What is this, Gautham? We buy a car for the first time, and when we plan to go to the temple together. And you say, you have got other plans? Whatever it is, have it postponed. It's not like that mom, I have got important stuff... Aren't you the one who is supposed to take care of Dad, Mom and Granny? Who else do we have? My dear, can't you drive that far? And so even that got decided. I was to become Nanappan's caretaker. We will go. - Hmm? - Belt. So shall we leave? Wait. Just don't leave yet Gautham. Isn't it our Kunjuttan's Baptism today, here’s a gift from Granny. The son of Marut. Anjaneya Swami. Kunjuttan will get my Gautham out of any trouble, Shall we go? Hey Sashindran, I bought a new car. Hey Gautham, what wrong with this Ramettan? With this 125,000, couldn't you have bought a better car? Your dad's crazy. Isn't he your own brother in law, can't you say it to his face? I loose it, when I see them.... Prakashettan, I am leaving. Are you leaving by train? I forgot to say, I bought a new car. That's good, it's more than enough for him. Hey Gautham, Gautham my dear. This is an awesome car, make it fly. Trial..Trial.. - It was trial. - It was out. That's not an out. His leg was still in the crease. Move aside. Move. All of you go and play alone. Gautham, did you clear all your paper in college? Yes, I did. Really, did you pass everything. Yes, I did pass. What is it with you? Heard your dad bought a four wheeled auto rickshaw. Hey Venky, don't go there. Don't go where? Weren't you the one, trying to avoid me in college? We were supposed to buy a Lancer. That's when you dad buy's a four wheeled air conditioned auto rickshaw. Don't be so mean. No matter what, a car will always be a car. There are 2 types of cars. The first one is, car; and there is, whatever that he bought now. Hey, don't push it. - Why? - Those who don't get to touch their own car's needn't lecture. But I will. What all did you say then? Even if you didn't buy, I had a lot of dreams. Trip to Munnar, with a boot filled with beer, sunroof. You had to ruin it all. Hey, we still can go for trip to Munnar. We can hire a cab, if we have to. Hiring a cab till Munnar, brilliant. Move aside. Go and sit in your auto rickshaw. I have to go to the store. Hey, it wasn't me, but my dad who bought the car. You don't need to say much about your dad, doesn't he still cycle with center stand on. Gauthametta. What is it? Can you atleast install a sunroof? Hey Kichu, assume we only got 1000 sq feet of land, and if 800 sq feet goes for the pool, then what am I to do with the rest? What is it, all gloomy? Nothing like that. - Are you upset with me? - Why? Then I am upset with you. Upset! For what? Why didn't you tell me that you bought a car? Who told you about the car? Venkedi. Oh my God! Sir, how about we do Malayalam poetry recitation... Yeah, it was Venkedi. Why didn't you tell me that you bought a car? Well, I wanted it to be a surprise for you. Really? What's there to be surprised now? Since your surprise has been ruined anyway, will you do something for me? Why not? What is it that my dear Nimmy wishes for? Isn't the college day tomorrow? Yes it is. Could you then bring your car tomorrow? - Car? - Why, is it too much to ask? Tomorrow? Tomorrow is Friday, sorry can't do it. I have to get the vehicle registered, tomorrow. Tomorrow is Thursday, they won't register it then. Then, it should be fine? - Tomorrow is Thursday? - Yes. - So,.. - So? - You can bring the car? - I can bring the car. So, it's fixed? I will, I will bring the car. All right then, bye. See you tomorrow. What's this? Is this your Halloween costume? You need to be dressed to kill, even after you are dead. I won't give up that easily, you looser. I don't plan on loosing my face in front of her. Not even in my dreams, had I thought that you will bring this. What's wrong with it? Anyways, isn't she supposed to be my life partner? So she needs to know the truth about me. Isn't the truth a bit too naked? My dear moron Venkedi, there's something that you don't know about. Girl's like simplicity. I will be out taking a joyride with her, - for you to see. - Gautham. Bloody fool. Did you bring your car? Of course, yes. Since, my dad gone out with the Honda City, I had to come with this car. I could call and ask my dad to bring the Honda City. - No, it's alright. - My dad's cool. I will just come now. Okay.. Okay.. When did that cycle got renamed as City? Listen looser, God has given me something he didn't give you. I know, stinginess. No, intelligence. Where to keep these? You can put it in the boot. Let me take that. Seems heavy. Are those flip down seats, your so called boot? Zip it, and just get the stuff inside the car. Not good for anything other than harm. Nimmy, isn't it great that this car has such a feature? - Shut up.. - Don't keep that in the boot. Keep that on the rear seat. Don't worry, both are the same. I will keep those. - Isn't this the Madhalam? - No, Chenda. Oh, its a Chenda. You dumbo, you still don't get it, right? This is her tactics, to make sure that no one else sits in the rear, and for her to sit with me in the front. So, ain't I sitting in the front? No, your dad. Weren't you making fun of it calling a four wheeled auto rickshaw, - Now, get off my auto rickshaw. - Gautham. -You get lost. Please drop these at festive collection. - Alright then. - Shall we leave? Gautham, you go ahead, I will follow you. My friend is waiting, that's why? Bye. Weren't we going together...? What do you think now? Haven't I become experienced now? - Wat.... - Eh? To drink, water. I can't be seen with this car now. I am an experienced driver now. Listen to your dad. We bought this car for 125,000. After paying that much money, how can we junk it without using it to it's maximum. We are not junking it, but selling it. But still, 125,000 is not a small amount. Do you know how many zero's are there in 125,000? Didn't you promise me that we will, once I am experienced? Now, you are going back on your word? I am not, I was just explaining things. Now, I am going to give you my word? Use it to the maximum. If anything goes wrong with it, we will trade it for a new car. Dad, please don't, make a fool out of me. I am running out of breath. My tongue is going weak. Looks like low blood sodium. I am tired. Water. Water. It's really sweet, have it. I got embarrassed everywhere. In front of neighbours, family and even the girl I loved. I am thinking of fleeing this place. Will you get high if you drink cola? - If you are really sad, you will. - Oh, is it. Everyone at home, loves him more than me. Him? Who is that? Everyone calls that Nano as Nanappan. Nanappan! I am just the driver. I have had enough. Can't you tell this to your folks and sell it? Tell them what? I have already tried my best. I see a bright political future for my dad. Going back on promises. Buttering and diplomacy. So what did uncle say? Will sell it is worn off? Gautham, won't your life be also worn off by then? My life is over. It's over. My life is screwed. Gautham, don't get too sentimental? Then, what should I do? I am going to flee this place. I have had enough. I will give you an idea. What is it? You better go somewhere. - Great idea. - Don't mess with me. You are going to go to Munnar. And we are all coming with you as planned. But, how will we go? Hey we will go to Munnar with Nanappan, will have a blast. Will come back with a brilliant idea to junk Nanappan. Awesome. Then, I will be needing a jacket. - I don't have a jacket. - Jacket, for what? Isn't it really cold in Munnar? Who is taking you there to Munnar? You aren't old enough for that. We could drop you at Marine drive, on the way. - She wants to go to Munnar! - But...? - Isn't this going to cost money? - Of course, for petrol, food. We will all need to pool. We three alone can't pull it off. There is someone else who can. He will jump in, on hearing trip. And he will take care of all the expenses. Who is that? He is my cousin. The name is Sampath. Sampath? We can't tolerate you, to begin with. That's when you bring in your cousin. I thought, you could go to Munnar and solve your issues. - Stop here, Sampath bro. - Venkedi, my boy. Where will I sit? - In the rear. - Rear. Damn. - Will we come back with an idea? - Definitely. So we all rallied behind Venkedi's idea, and decided to finally make that Munnar trip. Open the windows, aren't we going to a cold place? Oh! Fresh air, fresh air. I was well planned when you called. That's why I called you itself. I am sure there is no one else in this world, like you to go for this trip. I am really starving. I am thinking about stopping and having lunch before continuing. We needn’t stop for lunch. I have all sort's of food in my bag. Have this banana. Don't you want it, it's really good. I have Pappada Vada, Rice Flour Cannoli, Tapioca Chips, have it. - KFC? - KFC! I have KFC too, Kattappana Fried Chips. Pass it. Here, hold it. Come fast, else Sampath will have it all by himself. Step aside, keep these too. Come, come let's go. Hey, they tricked you, this thing doesn't have a fuel tank. You fool, it's fuel tank is up front. Hey, move aside. Don't know a thing. Oh no, where has it gone, it's engine is missing. What, it's engine is missing? - We came this far without an engine. - Didn't I say that there was something odd when we came up that hill. You morons, it's engine is in the rear. - Oh! Rear engined. - Rear engine. These damn fools. Hey bro, petrol. Sampath bro, for how much? Fill it. - As much as you want. - How much? - Say thousand. - Thousand. Bro, for a thousand bugs. Sampath bro. Sampath bro, the cash. - Give it. - Yeah, the cash. Just give it. Damn, we are screwed. Where is the beer? In the boot. Open the boot. Sir, this car doesn’t have a boot. Boss, they are saying that this car doesn’t have a boot. Boss will let you know. Sir, we have a few beer, that's all. What a relief? Beautiful place. What a breeze? In the valley. Close, get closer. Stop, stop. Not with the car. I will stand here. Ready! One, Two, Three. - Show me. - It came out good. This is Echo Point. Hey Gautham. Didn't your dad tell that he will buy a new car if anything happens to this? Why don't we wreck this car then? That's true. Let's wreck it. Hey stop, stop. Isn't this my dad's car? My dad lost his 125,000. No, I won't let you ruin my dad's cash. I won't let you ruin it. That's enough. That's enough of wrecking. Clean it, everyone clean it up. Everyone just finish up the beer. - How will we clean this up? - Just drink it up. His damn idea. It's stinking with the smell of beer. That's true. Idiot. Finish it up. Damn, even the beer got over. Hey Venky, please don't sleep. Who is sleeping, you better don't sleep, we are all wide awake here. You better be. All of you are high, only I am sober. I haven't had a sip. I have a small desire, can you please overtake that auto rickshaw at least? Please, I would love to see it. This can overtake an auto rickshaw, I will show it to you. Hey, watch out, we are going to overtake an auto rickshaw. Ready? Stop, stop the car. Gauthaman's car is chasing an auto rickshaw? Hey, you prick in the auto. If we can't chase an auto rickshaw, then whats the point of we being in a car? Just wait for it. His damn auto rickshaw. Gautham, you are a pro driver now. - Venky. - Yeah. Venky, we lost the brakes. You are not getting the brake? Awesome. Mission Success. We have successfully wrecked this vehicle. - Hey Venky, we don't have brakes. - Don’t have brakes? No, don't have. I can't get the brakes. You might be stamping on the wrong thing, stamp on the middle pedal. That's the brake. It doesn't have brakes. Here red flag, somebody please save us. Red flag, somebody please save us. What happened? What is it? They are gone... They are gone.... While coming downhill, we couldn't stop. Looks like we lost the brake. That's why we stopped. Hey, what is it? - We have lost Sampath bro and Alby. Hey, what is it that you lost? Hey, they are high and asleep. If they ask about Sampath, what so I tell them? - Are you drunk? - No bro. I haven't touched it, not even a drop. I will be right back. What do I tell, if they call from home? I am going to miss you Sampath bro. Hey Venky, come here. Sampath bro, I am going to miss... Finally, some relief. Give me that. - Are you okay now, Venky? - Hey, wake up. He isn't waking up. Sampath bro is just awesome. He isn't even old enough to drink, but still had way too much to drink. Sampath is just asleep, there is nothing wrong with him, Venky. - Sampath bro is just awesome. - Don’t cry.....Don’t cry.... Put him inside. - I will fix it. - Sampath bro is just awesome. Get inside. Lie down, be quiet. What's wrong? Their car doesn't have brakes, and they are drunk. - Where's his head? - They are all bottoms up! - Sorry bro. - My dear, the weather is really bad here. Those sober can't drive through here. So how can those who are drunk like you all. - That's true. - Are you drunk? He isn't. What happened then? It was all fine, but as we came down this hill, we lost our brake. It didn't stop, even though I tried to brake. I then managed to stop somehow. - Be quiet. - Open the bonnet. Yeah sure. Where are you coming from? We are coming from Munnar. Where to? To Ernakulam. Looks like you are out of brake fluid. It's better that you show it a garage tomorrow before leaving. Bro, that's. Wasn't there a lot of twists and turns, that’s how you lost the brakes. We need to leave tonight itself, tomorrow we need to... From where are you going to find a mechanic, tonight. In this condition, you wouldn't make it home, in this car. It's better that you don't leave. One guy just left now, without listening, need to wait and see what happens to him. We have nothing to gain, by making you stay back. All of those who had dinner from here, and continued with their journey, despite our advise, they all end up in the next day's newspaper. It's better that you don't leave now. Hey, the brake fluid is clogged. The brake fluid is jammed. Hey bro, we will stay back. That's better. Lose of face, love and money....Hmm... You just wait and watch, you will be out of my home soon. You won't get to be this arrogant for much long. You better watch out! My dear, don’t leave. I have got something to say. Stop. The brake got fixed. That's what happen, when you cross paths with nice people. Don't wear it off again. What happened? We really didn't have brakes yesterday. And that was a blessing in disguise. It stopped you from leaving. Would have reached home then. That Auto rickshaw guy that left before you, a tree fell and both his vehicle and him are no more. Your car broke down at the right time. Just think about it, had you guys too left, what would have happened. You guys are lucky that your car stopped at the right place. It was the first and last time, that Nanappan ever got cranky with me. When my last-ditch effort to avoid him from life also failed, I realised something, my life is going to get burned in this 700 cc. All the festivals and seasons came and went thrice after that. The wheel of time, was spinning faster than Nanappan's fuel price could rise, bringing it to the Residential Associations 15th anniversary. Mom tried out new experiments, in Thiruvathira. Dad gracefully welcomed the 3 new Grey hair's in his mustache. Even in the ripe age of 82, granny found ways to keep herself busy and enjoy. Kichu and friends, started grooving to new tracks. Venkedi and me were at final year, with a project that we were absolutely clueless about. Even though time's and timepieces's had changed, Nanappan and me were still stuck together. Gautham, my dear, will anyone of you, get a vehicle and go to Habib's place and give the pots and some money.. Sure uncle, I will take my car. Which car do you plan to take? Does it have diesel? Don't you have exams? Go and prepare for that. Fine, I will. My dear, you please go... Just go with Nanappan and... Please. Please go my dear. No need to push him, he will go. The good things about Nano is that, If you put fuel for 300 Rupees, you can cover 600 KM's with that. - 600! - Almost 600. - 600? - Around 60. - I am not coming anywhere. - You better come. - Leave me. - Just come. Stop fooling around. Won't even let to sit in peace, his dad's damn pot. Hey Gautham, I was just thinking, how about we rent out this car to some caterers. I have an even better idea. How about selling you off to child traffickers? You needn't pull my leg, just because, I don’t have facial hair. My mustache slowly is connecting to my beard. What are you laughing about? Nothing much to laugh about. Who is that? Stop there! Stop the bike, you idiot. You are the first person I am going to hit after my 10th grade. Stop it..Stop right now. Chase, chase, chase. He could be some chain snatcher. Overtake him. Hook him from the left and stick him to the wall. Stop. Do you seem him get away, you fool. You fool, his engine is half the size of our's. Overtake him. Faster. He is getting away. There he is. Got him, got him. Hey Shaji, come fast. How dare you ride off, after crashing into us? - Gautham, go easy on him. - Mom. Why didn't you stop? How dare you run your mouth, after crashing into me? Is that how you want to play it? You break my side mirror, then you slap me and now you are trying to justify yourself. Didn't you crash into her? We all saw it. "We"? Who all are "we"? That's us. We all saw. Bro, she broke our side mirror, and then didn't stop, no matter how many times we honked. That's how we got to this intersection, and finally cornered her. If she had any decency, would we have needed to do any of this. You can ask my friend. Hey Venkedi come here. Won't your friend speak in favour of you. He saw everything from the front seat. He is the wishnes... Witness. Ask him? Hey, isn't she the one who crashed into us? Tell them. - Looks like he was sleeping. - Are you hurt? My hand's are aching. Somebody please get some water. What all are you looking at when someone is about to die? Get her some water. You moron, what are you doing? My hands are really paining. That's because your hands are restless. Don't try acting smart after causing all of this. If you dare touch us, things will get ugly. Yes, things will get ugly, that’s what even I have got to say. My crew will be here. - Which crew? - Our neighbourhood crew. Yeah, our crew will come, we are not to be taken easily. Got that, you fatso. Hey, I am an assole. If you are an assole, how does it affect us. We are only happy about it. So no one has any problem, let's all go home. - Hey, do you have a problem? - She does. Wow, the brakes worked this time. What's going on here? Gautham, I will go and get a lawyer for your bail. Catch him. Sir, he tried killing this girl by running over her. - Is that true? - Yes sir. Come her. Are you drunk? - No Sir. - Blow into this. - Don't lie. - They are the one's who hit her. Sir, let me explain. She overtook from the left side, isn't that wrong? - No sir. - Look at that mirror. While we were coming from there, she came crashed our mirror and sped off. - We were honking asking her to stop. - No sir. - Didn't we honk? - It's not like that. You know what sir, she put the right turn indicator and turned towards the left side. She herself crashed into our vehicle and fell down. Sir, these guys are lying, she can't move her hand. Not only that sir, they wrecked my new bike, just off the showroom floor, yet to be registered. Do you hit, yet to be registered vehicles on purpose? Sir, when we hit, we don't check whether it's yet to be registered or old, we just hit. Let me just hit... Enough of it, we need to take her to the hospital. Sir, won't you take her to hospital? Not me, take her in your car. Get her in, you too. Get in the car, all of you. And you in this car. Are you all happy now that I am bring sent to the prison. So, there's no one to come from your home? - No, my dad's abroad. - Oh, is it? - And, what do you do? - I am studying architecture. What has she got this much to say? She is scheming ways to get you locked up. Stop it. She is the one who crashed into us. Yes, she did, but then didn't you chase and crash into her? - But, didn't you ask to chase her? - Congratulations. - Why sir? - Did he become a father? You broke that girls hand and.. It broke, she totally deserves it. - That's good. - Come, the boss is calling you. Will we get arrested sir? And you don't know them from before. May I come in sir? Does this look like a school, come inside. Look at the innocence drooling off their faces? Yes good morning. Catch him, don’t let him go. He is an escaped convict. Damn. Shit, just missed him. Sorry. Just miss. Hey, couldn't you have missed him. It happened all too fast for me. If you want I, no we could go and catch him. No need, you have got a lot to do here. This girls hand broke, due to your death race. So, what should we do next? Do we need to go to the station? Or compromise? Sir, if she pays for our broken mirror, we will get going. We don't want to press charges. My dear, you are ready to press charges. I am ready sir. - Subash. - Yes. - My dear Gautham. - Sir. You stalked and chased the girl name Kalyani, and tried to kill her by running her over with your car, and in front of the public, abused the above mentioned girl. If I charge such a case, you will be locked up for a minimum of ten years. Sir, he was the one who was driving, it's his car, I was riding shotgun, and I was wearing my seat belt too. I didn't do anything, you can check with the girl. I don't know anything. So he will go in, not you. Thank you sir. - I will get a lawyer. - You Brutus. Sir, so what about this hag slapping me? Those are trivial issues. Then, even for you addressing her as a hag, I can charge a case against you. Haven't you heard, "Woman Empowerment"? So, what's your decision? How do you want the case? Settlement or compromise? - Aren't both the same? - Keep quiet, he is a fool. We prefer settlement, because we are people friendly. Definitely. Say it. - Sir. - Yes. - Compromise. - Subash, read it out loud. Compromise deed. Both parties agree that, till such time that Miss Kalyani's broken hand is healed, all her hospital procedure's will be overseen by Gautham. Ramendran, and the damage done to Gautham Ramendran's car will be fixed by Miss. Kalyani; in the presence of south station inspector Dundu Francis. Name. Signed. You will learn to be punctual, when cops get involved. Hello. Are you going on a road trip or what? I thought I will dress decently, since we are going to the hospital. Are you going grocery shopping? What is it that you guy's are doing? - You hand.. - Get off me. It's only because of that Inspector, that I am getting in your crappy car, else I could have gone in some auto rickshaw. Hey listen Kallu, we just.. Kallu, who is Kallu! Listen, I only need a driver to get to the hospital, and don't need a bodyguard. Open the door. What, bodyguard! You are on your own now. What are you waiting for? So Nanappan contributed one more person to suck the blood out of my life. Biker Vampire. From then on, for me it was sleepless nights, sorry days. Dude, I am done. She calls up early in the morning and order's me to come with the car. Hello. I could manage it, if I was to take her to the hospital alone. But that alone is not enough for her. - Need to go to that hospital. Appointments at 10. This early! A tornado would have completed the picture. Hey. It's the Biker Vampire, I won't pick up. She want's to assign me with the next task. Couldn't you fixed this earlier? - I will hit you this. - I dare you to. Hospital or police station, what is it going to be. Hospital. I did her entire grocery shopping. Can't take it anymore. No, don't. Stop, could you please open the car door. No, I can't. I will make you pay for this. You can't! You will suffer for this. Mom, where is Nanappan's key? It should be there somewhere. Just look around. Mom. I am tired of this boy. What is it? Where did you keep it? Move. I am running late. Hold it. How's this possible? - Have your breakfast and go. - I will have it later. Dad, move, move, move... - What is this? - I was giving him a bath. What are you doing? Dad, have you ever given me a bath like this? Where are you rushing to? Get out of my way. Where? Come, get in. Could you please close that door? With this hand? Shouldn't move your other hand at all. You can have that too plastered soon. Pure trouble. I don't want to hear you. Who is talking to you anyway? Can you please go fast? This car will only travel slowly. Already half an hour late. Damn, my hands hurt. That's normal when you go over speed bumps. Kalyani's driver, please pay this bill. Driver? Isn't it 800? Here. Let's go. I just would like to know, How many times did you watch Erin Brockovich? Wow, look who is here? Nair, is that you? Diwakaran, you should be on your way back after selling all the milk. Is your dad and that cycle twins? Don't go there. That cycle is as old as my grandfather. So it's family heirloom. - Is Nandini, your cow fine? Who is that? -Yes she is fine. It's that Biker Vampire. In this whole village, only you Diwakar has got pure milk? Even though this society has got adulterated, Diwakar can't be like that. This scene is not there. Is that all, I thought he is going to be a mean villain? - Anirudhan. - Dad, dad. Anirudhan... Anirudhan... - What happened? Is he over? - Someone get a metal key fast. - I have a key. - Dad's not waking up. Somebody get some water fast. Will someone call an Ambulance? - Anirudhan. - Uncle, what will we do now. - Hey, go and get your car. - My car keys are locked in his hands. Someone please get a car. Somebody bring a car, please. - Anirudha..Anirudhaa.. - I will get the car. I will get the car. Our car? We will take our car, you go and bring Kichu's dad to the entrance. This road might be blocked. - Alby, he is not opening his eye's. There's a shortcut through which only Auto rickshaw's can pass. - Where? - Through there. - Which one? - This one. - This left? - Yes, through here. - He is not moving. - You please don't worry. Bro.. Bro. Honey. Through this pocket road. Gautham, pull over to the side. - Open it. - Call them. Gautham, get a stretcher. We need a stretcher. Hey, lay him down. - Lay him here. - Be careful. - Okay bro, keep moving. - Hurry up. Uncle. Dad, he has been taken to the ICU. Did the doctor check him? At times, I feel that Nanappan isn't that big a trouble maker. It's not just a feeling, it's a fact. Kichu don't cry like this, let me get some water. Why are you crying like this? Nothing happened for that. Isn't this common for those with fits? She got scared, she is really sensitive. When you have really nice brothers like this, why do you have to be scared? - Thanks. - Please sign here. - How much? - 35 rupees. Nurse, do you have any injection to make them stop cry? Don't you that facility here? Sister, isn't it enough that someone signs for it. Yeah. Hey you, are you trying to cheat me or what? Your next patients here. Hey, you itself. How many time's did I call you? I knew it then itself that you aren't responsible at all. - You broke my hand and my bike.. - Keep quiet. This is a hospital. You can't make noise over here. Gautham, I have told you many times, we need not have anything to do with her. Look at her carefully, you can make it out that she is a crook. Today he plaster is on this hand, yesterday it was on the other hand. Tomorrow it will be on her forehead, and the day after, she will cover her entire body, like, THE MUMMY and will continue to cheat us. - Silence. - You shut up. What is it? Sorry sister. Sorry Kichu, your bro got a bit emotional. Why is your friend, overreacting? How many time's did I call you? One minute. Kichu, didn't the nurse tell you that it's all fine. Then, why are you crying like this? It's not like, there's nothing wrong. Because, he got here on time, there's nothing wrong. Let me just comfort her? - Don't we have to show my hand? - What? Hey, why don't you register your car as an ambulance here? Yeah, right. That's enough. Kichu, I will be right back. You come here. What is it? I called you many times, but you didn't answer. My phone is in the car. My friend's dad had seizure yesterday. Almost immediately, we rushed him to the hospital. I left my phone in the car, so I couldn’t attend. Sorry. Why is that girl crying? That girl? She is crying from the joy of her dad having seizure. We are having a party tonight. Ain't you coming? Then, you stay with here. I will get it dressed. You will go alone? So you are capable of understanding things? No, I will give it a try alone. No worries, I will also come. Well, I don't have a problem.. I have a problem.. I will also come, let's go. I thought you were a typical jerk. But you are not. - Shall I go? - Hmm. Doesn't mean that you have to be arrogant about it. Okay. Hey, I could come to pick you tomorrow. No need for that. No, it's alright. - I will come. - No need. Call me. Alright then. ♪ You are like the heart, that robs another heart, ♪ ♪ What are you?

If you are free tomorrow morning, will you come somewhere with me? No one is against for being in a relationship. But no one should even talk about marriage till you get a job and get on your feet. Is it because I had a job Sreenu, that I married you? We got till here, by selling the fruits and nuts off our farm. The God that gave us life, will give us the means. Granny, massage my hair. Your fruits and nuts! These day's, to live in the city, you need real money. Don't entertain his craziness. My dear boy, dad isn't encouraging you. You don't have anything. You two needn't quarrel over this. My boy, is old enough to think about his future. I married my Raman's father, when I was sixteen. Listen dear, your grandfather was only your age then. - Your grandfather was really - If you do that today, - graceful, like Apollo. - you will get booked for child abuse. Your grandfather used to buy me honey candy from then itself. So, grandpa was really romantic? Those used to be the days. Those days, from Ceylon your grandfather used to.. No, that's enough, I don't want to hear this story. Play with Tutu for now. I will come now. Yeah Venkedi. You get lost. There are people, who came from Ceylon. That’s enough. Do you really want to go to the middle east? Didn't you attend the campus interview? You will definitely get placed. Why don't you wait till then? This campus interview is a joke. If I keep waiting for that, the bank will foreclose my home. And the people we owe money, will start to eat our brains. I decided to go there, with my uncle, to avoid facing this music. In that case, I have got an awesome idea, you go and cheat some Arab there and make a lot of money and come, we will start a big business with that money together. Hey don't forget to get dates while you are there. Definitely. Instead of trying to stop him from leaving, you guys are just fooling around. I don't have a choice. I have a lot of pressure from home, and moreover there are a lot of debts owed by my dad, when he tried to do business like Trump. So, you have decided? It's decided, I have to settle all these commitments, after going abroad, and then get married, to make new commitments. Not funny. Didn't like it? Get lost. - Has he gone mad? - See you guys. I am going to start the life of an expat in a far off land. After that, I need to help you all out. You stop fooling around and try to help out your family. Hey Venkedi. Hey, do think over about that campus interview, before deciding anything. If one has to leave his friends and family behind, he should be really desperate. Gautham, what are you doing up here? Granny is really upset. You forgot that it's her birthday today. - Damn. - She is really grumpy. You do one thing. You hold this. - Here. - Silk? Give this to her. And cheer her up. - Gautham. - Hmm. - Come. - I will. Granny. Granny. Granny, why are you upset? Please don't hurt me. Look what Gautham has got for your birthday. Look... Look.. Granny's favorite Silk, here. Didn't like it, what happened? Hey, this isn't cool. To be upset on your birthday, you are 80 now. We need to score a 100. Yeah right! Will anyone be happy when they grow old, you fool? What if you have grown old? You are still a dream girl, Mr granny. That reminds of something, back then your grandfather, my Raman's father. That’s' enough, I don't want to hear this story. It's not that, back then he used to say, I used to look like Sheela in Chemmeen. Yeah right! And then Pareekutty used to drive all the way from Ceylon to see his Karuthamma. (Song from Chemmeen.) Honey, here is your honey candy. Isn't this that story. Look at her, an old beauty queen. You get lost. What to do? I had big plans for mom's 80th birthday, by calling friends and family. Dad, you can still do that. What's the use of all that? All our relatives are scattered across Chennai and Mumbai. What's the use of mom being upset? So, that's the real reason. Dad, that's not an issue. I will fix it now. Mr Karuthamma, today is your big day. What more do you need to be happy? Evening at temple, more of Silk. What do you want, tell me? Mom, don't have it all, you are getting older. Tell me Karuthamma. I don't want anything. Look here. Your grandchild is worth 300 rupees. Tell me, granny. I will get you anything under the sky, that can be bought for money. This Gautham will fulfill it. Will you fulfill my wish? For sure, I will arrange it. Then I need to see Rama Sethu. Will you arrange that for me? Rama Sethu! - Dad? - I heard. Here's my share of 300.

So Gautham, I don't have much of advice for you. Don't get yourself into trouble, I can't be there with you like before to get beaten up and hatch schemes. I will be an expat as soon as I cross those gates. So anyways, I am only leaving physically. I have left my soul in the front seat of your Nanappan, go and keep it safely in our neighborhood’s fence wall. All right then I am leaving, I might cry if I stay. I am totally feeling low. Granny is no more. Venkedi too has left. I feel like I am loosing everyone I love. I get it. How attached you were with your granny, and what Venkedi meant to you? - But, if you are going to be like this, They were a part of my life. I know that. I am like half dead now. I feel empty inside. But, there's something you need to know. Nothing or nobody is constant in life. Everyone will get busy with their own stuff. But if you keep looking, there will always be someone. And maybe, that person can bring light into your life. But, I am surrounded by darkness. I feel all alone. What about me? It's not that. I smell a break-up. So, that's what it is all about? Usually, it's in such scenarios that it takes place. We will make a call on this, today itself. Are you going to break-up with me, now itself? Aren't your parent's fine with our relationship? So you need to know what's my parent's feel? Hmm. I will talk to my dad, and get you an appointment. Who is your dad, to be met only by appointment? Aren't you Gautham? You should have got my photo? - I too got one. - I don't need a photo for this. I figured out it was you, from your excitement. Kalayani has told me everything. I can make a decision, if I get to hear what Gautham has to say. Uncle, Sir, order please. Fresh lime. Give us something chill. The best in the menu. What about Mojito? - Good choice. - Isn't that Mogito? - Mogito? - No Mojito. Mojito. Now tell me. What's you position? Uncle, I love Kalyani. Will you let me marry Kalyani? Usually, at this point the girl's father turn's out to be the villain. But the smartness you showed in presenting things with a cool mind. I liked that. I am impressed. Thank you. Gautham, who all do you have at home? Mom, Dad and Granny. Only Dad, Mom and me at my home. Are they working? My dad's a retired Postmaster. My mom's a homemaker. You are the only son? Yes. Pampered? Nothing like that. What do you do now, Gautham? Now, I have got through my campus selection. Just waiting for now. They will call soon. Move that car, they need to put lights. So, you and Kalayani are the same age? Almost the same age. Excuse me sir, could you please move your car. Fine, I will do it in 10 min's. Okay sir, that's alright. Gautham, is that your car? This is my dad's car, that we use at home. So Gautham do you have a different car? I too drive this. - It's a nice car. - Yes.Yes. How much did it cost? - 125,000. - Hmm? One hundred and twenty five thousand. That's it. We bought it used. Did you buy it, Gautham? - My dad. - Nice car. There was an incident behind which the company chairman decided to launch such a car, in the car market. Do you know that story Gautham? One day this company's chairman, while traveling through the streets of Mumbai, in his luxury car, gets to a sight at the traffic stop. A person going for work in his bike, along with his wife and 3 kids, and all of their stuff. An entire life traveling on a bike cramped, with all their live's hanging by a thin thread. That's what he got to saw? Oh! Had it been Gautham or me in his position, we would have made cliche comment of, couldn't you have squeezed one more in, and would have left. But what he thought and did, became history. What kind of an industrialist are you, if you can't do anything to ensure the safe travel of a normal family, in one's own country, was the question he asked to himself, and the answer is the car that Gautham's dad bought. India's cheapest car. How will I get my daughter married to you Gautham, to someone who can't even afford to buy such a used car on his own? Uncle, I am not asking you to rush. Then? - After I get a good job. - That's the kind of life she is used to. I would like to marry her off to somewhere better than that. So Gautham, just see it as an immature decision. You two talk it out among yourself. Nice meeting you. Here is my card. Maybe I can help you in some other way. Check please. We took many decisions, without thinking it over. We should have taken life a little more seriously. Otherwise, it will.. - I know of all this Kalyani. - What do you know? You father told me all of this yesterday. Why aren't you understanding? I understood, Kalyani. And what did you understand? We fell in love, without thinking about the future. I get it now. That's not it, why aren't you thinking about our parents. Damn cliche. Uptown Girl. Downtown boy. Our families don't match. But it's true. I won't be able to provide an environment like the one you grew up. See, this is not the way to handle it. Yeah. This isn't how you handle it. That's what your dad told too. There's no need to keep it going. Let me just speak, Gautham. I know what you are about to say. And I have come prepared for that. Say it. In my present state, there are a lot of limits, to what I could do. I am trying my best.. Why are you stretching it? Aren't you a practical person? This won't work out.

Dad, I got a job. Is this how you say it? Sreenu. - Yeah. - Come here. Our son, got a job. Oh my God! My prayer's got answered. Let me just call Shibu. No dad, I need to join next week. Before that, we need to decide a few things. Listen, it's written Mumbai in this. After training, first posting will be in Mumbai. So it's just Dad, Mom and Nanappan, all alone here? You try for a transfer slowly.. I was coming to that. Before I leave, we need to sell the car. Is that needed? Let it be here. If I am not here, there's no need for that too here. Who is going to drive it here? It's not like you are gone forever. Won't you come for the holidays? You can drive it then. - Yeah. - No Mom. With such a good job, that car won't look nice. We will buy a new one. We can buy a new one, but there is no need to sell Nanappan. Dad, can we afford to maintain 2 car's at the same time. My dear, even after you have left, when the car is still there, we get the feeling that you are still here. Dad, could you please stop your cheap sentiment's? That vehicle is worn out. It's time is over. Gauthametta, Shall we buy Nanappan? For what? I will pay the money that you have agreed to sell it for. Are you mad, Kichu? Why do you need this completely worn out heap of trash? Other than wasting your money. Its not that bro, its the car that saved my dad's life. - Kichu. - I feel bad to see it go. This is just a machine. It doesn't have a soul. You needn't get emotional with it. Got it. I will open it. There's a small issue with the lock, we can change that. Even the clutch has issues. Oh, is the clutch loose? And the wiring is loose too. You may deduct the price for those. Please sign this paper. I will get it signed and bring it over. Dad, please sign these. Can't you just think it over? Dad, it's going to get rusted without being used, please listen to me. Please sign it. - Alright then. - Take it. One minute, let me try. Just stamp your feet. - That's it, not a big issue. - Okay. Alright then. Has it been long, since you came. No, I just came. All the papers are in this. We had transferred the first installment. - Didn't you get it? - Yeah, I got it. So, shall I leave? - Alright then. - Call me, if there is anything. Sure. Sir, just a minute. There's a few of your stuff inside the car, please take those as well. Shibu asked to bath Nanappan with shampoo. Buy me a silk. Sir, what happened? Is anything missing? No, I found it. Okay. Give him, to someone who is good. Sure sir. There's no point in being sentimental with me, I won't fall for your sentiments as well. If it meant that much, why did you sell the car. Basheerikka, that was a blunder I made 3 years ago. I have come to correct it. Haven't you heard that we only realise the true value of something after we loose it. That's absolutely true. I was persistent after that bro. Persistent to prove myself in front of Kalayani and her dad. You do things according to your whims and fancies, and then there's no point in crying out to me. I won't give you the car! Bro, my life's, memorable moment's took place in that car. My memories of my dad and mom, and my late granny is there in the car that is with you. From here on, I wish that car to be in my driveway. That's why I came all this way to see you. Have you seen the movie " In Harihar Nagar"? In that, the baddie John Honai says the dialogue, "Give me that briefcase." There's no use saying, "Give me that car", like that. I don't wish to sell it. Basheerikka, for how much did you buy that car? I paid 100,000+tax for that car. My dear bro, they tricked you. I sold them this car for 40,000. Do you know that? For 40,000? Yeah. Oh my God, so that's a loss of 60,000+tax. Let me make you an offer. You also go ahead and trick me. I will give you 125,000. Will you sell me the car then? My dear boy, my Biryani business runs out of it. - Biryani? - Yeah. Haven't you seen it by the side of the road? Ummukulsu Biryani for 50 rupees. It's a big business. That's mine. Alright, Then I will give you 135,000. Is it a deal then? Do we have a deal? I could change my business to an auto rickshaw. - Of course. - But that won't work out. My wife and kid haven't got enough of that car. Bro, 165,000. Don't ask for more, it's my 2 month's salary. Well, we can somehow convince the wife and kid. That's my daughter, Ummukulsu. Go ahead, and check out the car. Hi. - Haven't you found it? - Yeah. - Who is that? - That's Honai from Bombay. This car used to be his, before we bought it. Now, he want's it back. You are selling the car? What are you saying? No, you can't. He is ready to pay a premium for it. We will buy a new car. But still, this is our first car. That won't be a problem, it will be alright. Hello. Come, don't we have to close the deal? Your daughter. Come here my dear. Aren't you a good girl. This uncle will be taking this car. He has paid dad a lot of money, to buy car, toys and chocolates. Shall we buy it? Come, aren't you a good girl? Ain't you a good girl? Don't you worry about this. Here, take it. What's bothering you? You have nothing to worry. I am not taking him bro. From your wife's and daughter's face I can make out his place in your home. I have gone through the same, I can understand that. He belong's here now. Alright then. - Yeah dad. - My dear. Isn't he there itself? No dad. Someone else bought it from him. Can we get that person's address. He doesn't have the address. There's no use searching for it. - But still, if we try..? - I will call you back. Hello. Stop. My wife will surely understand. And she is only 5, if you buy her a few candy, she will forget all of this. But that's not how it is for old people. The joy on your father's and mother's face, when you take home Nanappan, that's worth a lot more. I will only be relieved, if you leave with that car, come on. Go on. What's in that car to pay such a premium? In that, it has a lot of his precious gems. A few of you might be wondering, why am I so possessive for this heap of nuts and bolts? But first car, that's an emotion. Every family must have had a first car. I now understand, what my grandmother meant when she said that a new car is like a new family member. As a family, we might spend the most time together at home. But everyone in a family sits closest to each other in a car. You might be thinking that the movie is over. But it isn't over. There's something that I did not mention to Basheerikka. Sir, I am slowly regaining all that I have lost. I am going to.. Hey, stop there. Leave, after you have heard me out. Listen, in my present state I can't convince my dad. But there is something else I can do. I can wait. Then, if you get a good job and come for me, I will come with you in your Nanappan. Really? And, don't interrupt other's while they are talking. Now, do you realise that girls can also makeup and not just breakup? Awesome. Awesome. Simply awesome. Putting an end to the tradition of breakup's, Biker Vampire waited for me in her dad's fort with a bag, not so heavy with social status. As I held Kalayani's hand and walked out of there, in front of her dad, it reminded me of Ramayana's climax that my granny used to say. If she was there today, she would have said something like this. And like Sree Raman who after reaching Lanka and killing Ravana, goes back to Ayodhya along with Seetha to a new life, my Gautham too along with Kalayani in Gautham's Chariot are on their way. ♪ Our quest is a never ending story. ♪ ♪ Colors, sounds, forests, flowers ♪ ♪ We passed through all of them, ♪ ♪ Slowly slowly, we also forget those wounds, ♪ ♪ Those painful memories as well. ♪ ♪ In this moon lit land, there are a lots of memories, ♪ ♪ refusing to fade away, ♪ ♪ Our quest is a never ending story. ♪
