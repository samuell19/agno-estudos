Welcome back to Seabrook, where belonging is everything. We're a strong, united and tight-knit community. And that's a good thing 'cause it wasn't always this way. There was a time when we had to protect ourselves. Legend has it that when the first settlers came to Seabrook, they found wild beasts with sharp claws lurking in the forest. Which sparked an epic battle. Seabrook settlers bravely fought off the monstrous attack. And discovered a powerful energy source. Realizing they discovered a precious resource, they safeguarded it from the beasts. They weren't going to let anyone steal their treasure. So they hid it. And the town prospered and grew rich by harnessing the precious energy source. Seabrook benefited greatly as it grew strong, happy, and unified. The beasts were a distant memory. Seabrook forgot monsters could be real. Until clearly, they were. A little lime soda mixed with a dash of industrial strength Seabrook energy... And boom! Zombies were created. In a lot of ways, Seabrook's moved on since then. But it's hard to bury your past. Let's go, let's go, let's go! Hey, I'm Zed. And yup, still a zombie. For zombies in Seabrook, things are changing. Every day is better than the last. Seabrook is getting rid of all of its old anti-monster laws, so now Zombietown is open to everyone. Come on! Wait, wait, wait! No, Zoey, wait for me! Wait. Watch out! And business is booming. Hey, hey! What's up, coach? Oh, football off-season has been good to me, Zed. Invested in a Fro-Yo cart. Little side hustle, gonna go global, gonna buy a car, get some dress shirts, go on vacation without my great aunt Edna. Though she loves swimwear weather. You know I might just bring her along. Cauliflower brains mocha crunch, please. You got it! Seabrook has way more flavors than just vanilla now. I'll take a vanilla, coach. What? I like vanilla. In a couple days, we're even tearing down old Seabrook power to build a new cheer pavilion. And not to take too much credit for all the positive changes, but yeah, I did good. It's hard to believe there was a time when people were afraid of zombies. Okay, let's triple check that. Hey, Dad. Hey, son. First day as foreman of the demo crew. - Big day for zombie-kind. - Yeah, you'll do great. Just don't make any lame zombie dad jokes. But the workin' stiffs love 'em. Go, Shrimpy! Go Shrimpy! Cheer Camp! Even more sparkly than I dreamed. Hi, I'm Addison, and this is cheer camp, a place where everyone belongs. We're a unified squad and... Split up. Usually unified. - Woo! - Yay, Bucky! That's cheer captain Bucky, my cousin. You've all heard the stories of bloodthirsty monsters who roam these woods, feasting on innocent cheerleaders. Boo! Well, those stories are just silly make believe. But you'd better believe we're gonna break you down and build you back up into peppy little cheer machines like... Lacey! Stacey! And our most recent Acey, JC. I'm Kevin. ...Right. We changed my name to JC, which I love by the way. Long live the Aceys! You three lead the veterans, you're the A-team. Addison, Bree, you take the newbies. You're the, uh, you're the Z-team. Hey, hey! Ho, ho! This demolition has got to go! They can't tear it down, Zed. Seabrook power hasn't worked for years. It's an important part of zombie heritage. This is progress, Eliza. And now we can even go to Prawn. Prawn is like super-sized prom, but Mighty Shrimp themed. And, this is the first year zombies can attend. And it's gonna be epic. I'm loud and proud to be a zombie. Sometimes too loud. Soon, Z-band tech will get so good that zombies will blend right in. I dream of a day we ditch our Z-bands and let our inner monsters roar. Zombies, this is obviously your first cheer camp. Now, I'm not anti-change, I'm just pro keeping things the way they are, because you don't mess with success. This week, the veterans and the newbies will compete for the Cheer Camp Cup to see who is more cheertastic! The veterans have always won the Cheer Camp Cup, right Aceys? Right! We'll see about that. To the cheer course! Watch and learn, snowball. Ah yes, my hair. Still white, still well-conditioned, and still drawing fire from the Aceys. Addison, get those pom-poms pumping. Let's show 'em that we got this. Yeah! - Let's go! - Come on, Z-team! ♪ We're back here on the scene and everyone's together ♪ ♪ With zombies on the team ♪ ♪ It's better than ever ♪ ♪ Better than ever ♪ ♪ Those moves won't get the gold ♪ ♪ Green hair is so whatever ♪ ♪ Well, you'll never break the mold ♪ ♪ 'Cause we're better than ever ♪ ♪ Better than ever ♪ ♪ Tearing down the power plant ♪ ♪ You're welcome, Seabrook ♪ ♪ I'm your man ♪ ♪ To build the place where everyone can cheer ♪ ♪ I'm making Zombie-kind cool, not feared ♪ ♪ Making progress, that sounds great ♪ ♪ But what's the price we have to pay? ♪ ♪ Ready for a new day, ready for a change ♪ ♪ People, zombies, everybody say ♪ ♪ Hey, we got this ♪ ♪ Teaming up to make progress ♪ ♪ Change the rules, you can't stop this ♪ ♪ Together we rise, you know we got this ♪ ♪ Hey, we got this ♪ ♪ Teaming up to make progress ♪ ♪ Change the rules you can't stop this ♪ ♪ Together we rise, you know we got this ♪ ♪ I wish that I could call I hope you get my letters ♪ ♪ Hope I get asked to Prawn ♪ ♪ And be better than ever ♪ ♪ Better than ever ♪ ♪ Oh Addison, my love's gargargaza forever ♪ - ♪ We pull the strings ♪ - ♪ We run the show ♪ ♪ 'Cause we're better than ever ♪ ♪ Better than ever ♪ ♪ Finally allowed to go to Prawn ♪ ♪ Gonna get our ziga-ziga-zombie on ♪ ♪ Counting down the days, I've been keeping track ♪ ♪ Kinda wishing Addison would write me back ♪ ♪ Imagine me taking her to the dance ♪ ♪ A human and a zombie, hand in hand ♪ ♪ Ready for a new day, ready for a change ♪ ♪ People, zombies, everybody say.. ♪ ♪ Hey, we got this ♪ ♪ Teaming up to make progress ♪ ♪ Change the rules, you can't stop this ♪ ♪ Together we rise, you know we got this ♪ ♪ Hey ♪ ♪ We got this ♪ ♪ Teaming up to make progress ♪ ♪ Change the rules, you can't stop this ♪ ♪ Together we rise, you know we got this ♪ Hmmm... ♪ Here in this hall, up on these walls ♪ ♪ Picturing Addison beside me ♪ ♪ Then they will say we're all the same ♪ ♪ And they can see the life inside me ♪ ♪ Oh what's it gonna take, what's it gonna take ♪ ♪ What's it gonna take, what's it gonna take ♪ ♪ What's it gonna take? ♪ The last day of Cheer Camp, and our final challenge!

Now let's make this victory about me. I've decided to be school president this year. Now technically, there's an election, but come on. Which means we'll need a new cheer captain while I rule the school. Who's worthy to lead? What do you mean? It's me! Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me! No! No, no, no, no. We... we need a captain that's going to build a united squad. Someone like Addison. Thanks, Bree. Being cheer captain has always been my dream. Addison! Addison! Addison! Addison! Addison! Cheer Camp's over and we're finally headed home. I'm so excited to see, well, you know. Yes! I got invited to Prawn! Well, getting invited to Prawn sounds great, but Bonzo won't even look at me. No invitation to Prawn for me, either. Do you think Zed forgot about me? No. When do I throw the confetti? You'll know. Addison... will you... Go to The Prawn! With... - Zed! - Uh-oh! Zed! Hi! Now! Is everybody okay? Nothing can happen to me, I'm way too important! Everyone, stay calm. Great leadership, Addie. Very future cheer captain of you. Zed! Ah! Who's there? Zed? Who's there? Hello? Can anybody hear me? Zed? Zed! I missed you too. There they are! Zoey. We're not alone. We're surrounded by... werewolves. Cool! - What? - Wolves? - What wolves? - Here wolves? Were-wolves? Nobody's gonna believe this. Werewolves are real! I always, always said the stories of monsters in the forest were real. And no one believed me. I thought werewolves were just myths. Yeah, like cavities. Those are real too? Werewolves, ew. I really hope my allergies don't act up. Please can I have one? I'm the only zombie in my class. A werewolf friend would be great. I'll feed him and walk him. Yeah, werewolves ain't class pets, Zoey. And they certainly ain't friendly. I'm okay. Aunt Missy, Uncle Dale. The crash was horrible, but I protected Addison. Anyone as courageous as me would've done the same. Though not really, I am super brave. Mom, Dad, everything is fine. It's not fine. There are werewolves circling us right now, waiting to attack. Yeah, and I'm way too tasty. I'm always looking like a snack. Somebody has to do something. And someone will. Hold my purse. By order of city council, effective immediately, all anti-monster laws are reinstated. Mom, that is unfair! - Zed, we need to talk. - We do. Even though you didn't write, or answer any of my letters. No, I wrote. A lot. The Aceys shredded all of our letters. Addison. Will you make me the luckiest zombie and be my date to Prawn? - No. - Great! No? Everyone's freaking out about werewolves, so the anti-monster laws are in affect again, which means... Zombies can't go to Prawn. Ouch. But we're going to fight this, Zed. Okay, so that's why you said no? Yeah. Why are you smiling? Because when you said no, I thought you didn't like me anymore. But the only problem here is a bunch of blood-thirsty werewolves. We can so fix that. Attention all citizens. Monster laws have been reinstated. All curfews will be strictly enforced. Attention all citizens. Werewolves have been sighted in the area. Take cover immediately. Keep children and pets inside. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We're closed. For good. Dreams of Fro-Yo success melted away. With monsters everywhere. Look, I like zombies. They like Fro-Yo. But werewolves like human flesh. Maybe with sprinkles. Everybody likes sprinkles. Just run. High knees, run! Attention all citizens. Werewolves have been sighted in the area. Take cover immediately. Keep children and pets inside. They see one werewolf, and we can't go to Prawn? Okay, we have to fight this. Protest. Boycott. Hunger strike! Fine. Finish your sandwich, but this is so unfair. Warning, werewolves have been sighted in the area. - Take cover immediately. - Zoey, come on home. It's not safe out here with these werewolves on the loose. Just one sec. Have you seen a werewolf? I'm looking for a were-friend. Silly kid, there's no such thing as werewolves. But we heard it howl. Maybe it was a hiker saying, "howl's it going?" It was a werewolf. My, what big eyes you have. Zoey! Come on. He's back. Wolves! Over here! Come gather! What did you find out? They saw you howling, Willa. So? We're exposed. Looks nothing like us, Wyatt. We have way better hair than that. Stop being such a worry-wolf, brother. I only said "awoo"! It's like saying "ciao" or "aloha." Or "I'll rip your throat out." Anyway, who cares what they think? It's a terrible town. We have to find the Great Alpha. If there even is a Great Alpha. Willa, we saw her in the forest. - She had the white hair. - It was probably just the light. She's real, and she's going to lead us to the moonstone. And you know we don't have much time. More and more of our pack are getting sick. Our necklaces are almost out of power. We need to find the moonstone. And when we do, we can recharge our necklaces and stay wolf strong for another 100 years. Okay. Even if the girl is the Great Alpha, how do we find her? I found this in the woods. It's hers. We'll track her down with our keen sense of smell. Says Seabrook High on it, so I thought we might just look there. Ugh! Okay, fine. We find the girl, and if she's the Great Alpha, she'll tell us where the moonstone is hidden. We go in the morning. We go tonight!

I wouldn't call it awful. They got something called Fro-Yo. Yeah, you're right. This town's the worst. Hey, I guess I will see you after tryouts. Yeah, sure, awesome. Hey, man, how are you... I really thought we'd all be at the Prawn together. - I thought Seabrook could change. - It did. Believe me, I will find a way to get us to the Prawn. Or we could miss it together. I'm not letting you miss the Prawn. If you can't go, I'm not going. Well, I like you too much not to let you go. Well, I like you too much to leave you behind. I am so not going. Ugh, you guys even fight like a perfect couple. How's it going, Eliza? You know, fighting injustice is keeping me busy. And looking good doing it, Zom-bae. I'm thinking the student president should get his own corner office. Let's see if we can move out the math department. - Write that down. - Done. Addison! Time to officially nominate me as president. Let's keep it understated, yet extravagant and flashy. Ooh, yeah. Make sure... Cheer could be so much more than just pom-pomming for Bucky. Uh, Addison? Once we're cheer captain, you are so off the team. And when I'm cheer captain, you'll be welcome to stay, because I'll be making cheer about bringing people together. That was awful trash talk. I know, right? You will never be cheer captain, freak. See ya. I gotta find a way to get us to the Prawn. We can crash it. I mean, we can't make the rules, but we can break 'em. Well, we can make the rules! We just need the right leader. Okay, are there any more nominees for president? Just a reminder that being part of student council means that we get to hang. Anybody, anybody want to hang? Just... anyone want to hang out? Anyone? Oh, we could come up with our very own complicated high five. That'd be fun, huh? Like... Oooh... Go! Go! Go! Hi! Good job! Okay. Great news, we have a brilliant and cheer tested candidate running for president this year. Me! Bucky! Bucky! Bucky! Bucky! Bucky! Bucky! Bucky! I'm running against Bucky for president, but I need to one-up his entrance. The question is, how? Bucky! Bucky! Bucky! Woo! Excuse me. Zombie strong! Hello, everyone. My name is Zed, and I am running for president. Zed can't steal my spotlight. What about the whole anti-monster thingy? Shh... Anyone can run for president, Bucky. She actually has a point, Mr. Bucky. - What?! - Yes. A zombie president? Ew! As the first ever zombie president, I will allow zombies to go to the Prawn, I will take Addison as my date, and we will get our photo on the Prawn wall of fame. Maybe they'll rename the school after me one day. Zed Necrodopolous High. Preferably before I graduate. Okay. If you vote for me, I will bring you prosperity and awesomeness! Zed! Zed! Zed! Zed! Zed! Zed! Zed! Zed! - The Great Alpha's near. - Focus. Remember, we're fierce, we're savage. We're werewolves! That's right, Wynter. We're scared of nothing. Except silver. Yeah, silver. And ticks. And rabies. Come on, if we're quiet, we can be in and out of here before they even know we're here. Ah, silver! Oh, pain! I can take it. No, I can't! Nice grab. Come on. As your president, I will make Seabrook a place that embraces zombies and... Werewolves? Uh, no. Why would we want... Werewolves! There she is! Football team! Defense, Z 24. - Right! - Let's go Mighty Shrimp! Where's the moonstone, white hair? I think you've got the wrong person. Uh, Eliza? What are you doing? Let's smash our Z-bands and zombie out. We can use our strength to fend them off. We can't lose control. We are not monsters. Our razor sharp claws will gut 'em and splatter their blood. Too much? Wolves! On my command! Willa. We can't go to war with the whole town. We'll never find the moonstone if they're on high alert. I hate it when you're right. Wolves, stand down. Okay. Sorry. We werewolves so admire your town, and we just came here to join your school. What? They can't join our school. Technically the Forbidden Forest is within the school district. So, welcome to Seabrook! Zed for prez! Vote Zed for prez, because I'm a zombie, not a zom-can't-be. Okay, here's our platform. We fight for zombie toppings on pizza in the cafeteria. -Right. - Get Zombie tongue taught as a second language. - Good. - And how to overthrow your oppressors after school club. - Eliza. - Sorry, right. Don't over promise. But more importantly, we allow zombies at Prawn. Good luck, Mr. Future President. Hey Zed, did you hear? Addie's being tested for captain, and she gets to run cheer practice tomorrow. It's not a big deal. Okay, it's huge. A huge chance to fail! If Addie aces this practice, oh my gosh, she's so going to be cheer captain once Bucky wins. He's so gonna win, because you know, elections, they're just like these big old popularity contests. And Bucky is super popular. So... what? Thanks, Bree. I know it's weird I'll only be cheer captain if Bucky's president, but... No, that just means neither of us can lose, because one of us is going to get what we want. And I can live with that. Me too. You'll do great, Zed. Zed for prez! Zed for prez! Thank you. Shish, boom. Bucky Buchanan for president. A vote for Bucky is a vote for cheer-fection. These sheep just let us in? Baaaad idea. We agreed to play nice. Oh, this is me being nice. Now let's find that moonstone. With cheer fans in Bucky's camp, and zombies and the football team in mine, the school's split right down the middle. Werewolves are the swing vote. Wolves are key to winning this election. But you know winning over the wolves is going to be hard. Trust me, I got this. We're going to win the wolves votes, and more. We just have to show them how to fit in, like us. Easy. Okay, this is a little bit weird. Hey, that dog just ate my homework! Lies! These history books claim werewolves attacked Seabrook settlers. But they struck first and stole our moonstone. I'm sorry, I didn't know that. There's a lot you don't know. I know the alarm's going to go off if you don't check out those books. Our necklaces have a way with electronics. Useless. None of these history books say where the moonstone is hidden. Win the wolves' vote, win the election. Easy. Hello wolves, allow me to introduce myself. I'm Zed, zombie, football star, presidential hopeful. ...Okay. When zombies first came to Seabrook, we were outsiders, too. Which is why you need a great president like Zed to represent you. We'd be honored if you guys joined us. Our pack is our pack. We don't need anyone else, so... Who doesn't want more friends? Underneath all that fluffy hair, I bet you're a real softie. I am a mean, mean werewolf, kid. I am tough and rough. Aww, you said "ruff." Like a sweet little puppy dog. Ruff, ruff! We are beasts of the forest, we will never be tamed. Oh boy. Oh wow, that's great. Oh wow. Sorry. We're nothing like you zombies. You sort of are. Your necklace is powered, right? Kind of like an organic Z-band. You're smarter than he looks. Thanks. That necklace keeps you from fully wolfing out? The opposite. Our moonstones make us our true werewolf selves. So without it you'd be human? No, we'd die. We'd be nothing. Imagine how alive you'd feel if you didn't have to tamp things down. Hold back your true selves. Actually, I've got this theory that zombies might've evolved beyond their need for Z-bands. Z-bands are great. They help you fit in. And I think you guys would have a much better time at Seabrook if you just followed in our footsteps. Join a club, play football. I'll even teach you how to tackle. Just lighten up. Be more like us. ♪ Do it like the zombies do ♪ ♪ Brush your fangs when you wake up ♪ ♪ Comb your hair, do your makeup ♪ ♪ Sleep at night, don't stay up ♪ ♪ Do it like the zombies do ♪ ♪ Don't stand out when you're fitting in ♪ ♪ When in doubt, do the opposite ♪ ♪ Don't listen to him ♪ ♪ He's a hypocrite ♪ ♪ Do it like the zombies do ♪ ♪ All you've got to do is give an inch ♪ ♪ Then we gonna take it to the top ♪ ♪ Do it like the zombies do ♪ ♪ When the moon is full, no howling ♪ ♪ Don't run in the halls, no growling ♪ ♪ Let's go to the mall start styling ♪ ♪ Do it like the zombies do ♪ ♪ Trim your claws, get a manicure ♪ ♪ Cut your fangs, leave it on the floor ♪ ♪ Now wag your tail like a Labrador ♪ ♪ Do it like the zombies do ♪ ♪ All you've got to do is give an inch ♪ ♪ Then we gonna take it to the top ♪ ♪ Do it like the zombies do ♪ ♪ Don't stop ♪ ♪ Do it ♪ ♪ Stand up, stand up ♪ ♪ Stand up straight and do your homework ♪ ♪ Smile a lot when you network ♪ ♪ Did I mention no one gets hurt? ♪ ♪ Do it like the zombies do ♪ ♪ I hope you're open to my advice ♪ ♪ Oh, it's invaluable to us, right? ♪ ♪ It sounds like this could be a paradise ♪ ♪ Do it like the zombies do ♪ ♪ Why should we change ♪ ♪ They should be like us ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ He may eat brains but he's got no guts ♪ ♪ He's gone insane, yeah, he's acting nuts ♪ ♪ Come on, we've got moves to bust ♪ ♪ Waaaah ♪ ♪ All you've got to do is give an inch ♪ ♪ Then we gonna take it to the top ♪ ♪ Do it like the zombies do ♪ ♪ Don't stop ♪ ♪ Do it like the zombies do ♪ Oh!

So the first step is... More glossy publicity shots. Yeah, I look a little human, but that's only because people are lumping werewolves and zombies together. I gotta show them that I'm nothing like those furballs. I am so fired up to be running cheer practice. Together, we can do anything. Sorry, but this practice space is for cheerleaders only. Ha! Just try and get us to leave. Wynter. Some respect. No, I don't want you to leave. I want you to stay. Show us what you can do. The cheer team is for everyone. Five, six, seven, eight! Yeah. That scruffy, super handsome, fine-smelling Wyatt is really into Addison. You know what? They're just cheering. And laughing. That was so amazing. You are all natural cheerleaders. But I'm sure she's just convincing the wolves to vote for me. We wolves work well together. But I'm not a wolf. Hmm. I'm not threatened. Wynter? Well done, Addison. With werewolves on cheer, this election is so in the bag. Bucky, this is not about politics. I always just felt like cheer could unite. You are going to make a great cheer captain. I'm gonna be cheer captain! I was thinking the team could move beyond trophies and we could start an outreach program. Whoa. Cheer is what I say cheer's about. And it's about winning. Hi, I'm Bucky. Vote for Bucky. Hey, Bucky Buchanan for president. You are a leader, Addison. But of something a lot greater than cheer. Zed! Zed! What's wrong? Werewolves. They're not interested in fitting in. They're into cheer. No, they're into you, and you're into him... them. What? Why are you acting like this? Do you know how hard it was for zombies? Now everything is just being handed to the werewolves - on a silver platter. - Actually, they hate silver. I'm trying to win an election for my people, for you. So we can go to Prawn, so we can be accepted. That's not being accepted. That's being afraid to show who you really are. Says the girl who wore a wig her whole life. Yeah. I did. Because I always felt like an outsider. And even though I might be cheer captain, I still do. You know I don't have a place here! Don't have a zombie crew. I don't know what I am!

Come with us. What's so important? You are. Where are we going? It's a wolf secret. If we told you, we'd have to kill you. Too much, too much, I knew it. Sorry. Welcome! But not too welcome! Are you okay? My necklace is losing its charge. Every day, more and more of our pack becomes sick because their moonstones lose their power. All of our elders are too sick to travel, which leaves... ...which leaves taking care of the pack to us. To me. You'll be fine, Wynter. I promise. You'd better be right about this. We need to find the moonstone soon. Follow us, Addison. Please. You guys! I have to go apologize to Addison right now. - Gruzah! - Yeah I know, I want to see it too. You know, ever since football ended, I've so missed watching you get pummeled. Attention citizens. All curfews will be strictly enforced. Yeah, with the curfew in effect, it's gonna be nearly impossible to get past the Z-patrol. Hey guys! And yet somehow Bree just did. Have you, have you guys seen Addison? She texted me for help, but she's not home, and she's not answering her phone. ...Oh. Hey, Bonzo. You guys, focus! Oh. Addison needs help. Okay, if her phone is on, I can track her. She's in the Forbidden Forest. The wolves. They kidnapped her. You guys, we have to help Addison. The wolf den! Wow. It's okay to be impressed. Our language. Addison! That means welcome. Ostrich boots? No, I think Addison meant Polka dot unicorn? Cool, where? Oh, no. Sorry, um. Uh... Whoa, whoa, language. There are were-pups around. She needs to put a pebble in the swear-wolf jar. I am so sorry. Enough. This is not why we brought her here. Why am I here? I believe you will lead us to the moonstone. I believe you're the Great Alpha. I believe you're a werewolf.

Zed! Don't make me take this off! You don't want to see me zombie out. Wolves! Stay back! No! No, stop! Zed! I want to be here! What? But... but you texted "Help!" I needed help on the chemistry homework. Didn't you see the beaker emoji? Oh... I do now. By the way, I love this new look. New hairstylist? Werewolves, they know hair. And manicures. Mmm-hmm. They think I may be a werewolf too. What? How? Maybe a grandparent. My hair means something. This could be my pack. For centuries, this has been set aside for the Great Alpha. A fully charged moonstone is priceless to us, Addison. If you're truly one of us, when you put it on, you'll be transformed into a werewolf. Part of our pack, forever. What? No! Wait. Can I think about it? For a day. Once you've joined us, you can lead us to the hidden moonstone. But she doesn't know where it is. What? Yeah. The explosion came from Seabrook Power. They must be testing charges for the demolition tomorrow. Seabrook Power is the birthplace of zombies. A little lime soda mixed with some mysterious energy, and bang! Zombies. Nice story, but it doesn't concern us. But it does concern you, Willa. Seabrook Power was fueled by a mysterious energy source. That could be your moonstone, right? She found the moonstone. She's amazing. If she's right... Wow. We'll see you at school tomorrow, Addison. Okay. Tomorrow. Big day. If they destroy that building, it'll crush the moonstone underneath. We can't let that happen. - Addison can help. - Maybe once she's one of us. But until then, I lead this pack. We need to stop them from destroying the moonstone. Whatever it takes. So. New look? I like it. My new friends like it. Did you join a, um, rock band? It's election day, Seabrook! We have an assembly to hear from our presidential candidates, and it is going to be so good to see you all. - Addison? - Check her out! - She looks amazing! - Look what she's wearing! That is a fresh look! Whoa! Bad hair day? Bad hair life? I think it looks great. Yeah, not so much. Addison, if you ever expect to be cheer captain... Well, maybe I don't. Maybe cheer team isn't for me after all. Addison! I was up all night thinking. You're not a werewolf, you can't be. But I love moonlight strolls. Yeah, you like sunsets too. That doesn't mean you're a vampire. - Zed... - Look. It's really hard being considered a monster. Trust me. All I've ever wanted is to find my pack. And now I finally have. When I see the wolves, I'm going to put this on. And I'm really sorry I can't make the debate, but I need to find the wolves. Good luck. Whoops, almost forgot. You'll do great, Zed. Are you ready for the debate? Come on, we're going to be late. You're going to prove to everyone that we're more than just... ...Monsters. - Bucky made me look... - ...Scary. Attention, attention. This is an active demolition site. All personnel please evacuate immediately. Demolition is scheduled for 5:00 PM this evening. All right, we don't have much time. This is how we sabotage the demolition and stop them. It's my responsibility to make sure we're all safe. We follow my lead. It's a good plan, Willa. What plan? We're going after the moonstone. Top secret. You can't tell anyone. Bad wolf, bad wolf! You're going after the moonstone now? It won't survive the detonation. Then let me join you. I'm ready to become a wolf. If you really are one. It's gone. You lost it? Do you know how precious a moonstone necklace is? If she was serious about being a wolf, if she was the Great Alpha, she wouldn't have been so careless. No, I... I don't know how! I... Stay out of our amazing hair. You got your speech? Addison's necklace? I took it. I can't let her become a werewolf. I have to protect her. All of this, running for president, it's all for her. No, Zed. This is bigger than that, okay? This is for you, for me, for all zombies everywhere. This is more important than anything else. Look, we'll deal with this later, okay? Just become president. That's what zombies need. Your first nominee for... Running for president, wearing the sequined Mighty Shrimp uniform... Three time MVP, lean, mean, cheering machine... And captain of our hearts... Bucky! Your other candidate of... Why not? Introducing our soon-to-be first green-haired president and repping a proud people, Zed! Hear him roar! Um no, actually, we're not going to roar. No roaring. Zed'll fight for you! You know what, um, I'm not going to fight. 'Cause, no, this isn't a fight. This is just a nice lil' cordial debate we're having here today. Good to hear, Zed. Oh, did you see that?

Zed for prez! Vote for me, because I swear I'm no monster. Oh no! Addison's necklace is shutting down your Z-band. See! See! He's a monster! Can't let them see me as monster! Breathe. Focus, okay? You can control this. You don't have to hide, Zed. I know you won't hurt me, big guy. But they don't! Go on, throw it! Zed, the necklace! Remove it! Zed, wait. I lost the election. Maybe. Probably. Yeah, you did. Look, but the problem is you lost yourself first. We triggered the alarm, hurry! Wolves, freeze where you are! Addie, are you okay? I lost the necklace, Bree. I let the wolves down. The Z-alarm? Attention! Attention! Monster activity at Seabrook Power. It's the werewolves. We need to help them. Bree, would you? I will. I'm in. Always. We can't do this alone. We need to rally the Z-team. Right. No. Actually, we're gonna need everyone. Aye-aye, captain. - Come on! - Okay. You're trespassing, werewolves! How can we be trespassing on our own land?

I know how hard you worked to get this job. But if it's gonna hurt the werewolves, you have to stop it. You're right. And Addison's right. Shut it down. Stop the detonation. Tomorrow, when it's safe, we'll find what you're looking for. But right now, you can all go home. Yes! Hey. We did it, we stopped the demo! What's wrong? Addison. I'm gonna lose the election, which means I can't take you to Prawn. That's okay, Zed. We cannot go to the Prawn together. He found it! Thank you. - What? - I took it. I stole it when you weren't looking. I thought I lost it. - I questioned myself. - Addison, I'm sorry. I was afraid that if you turned into a wolf, I'd lose you. You don't get to make that choice for me! But a werewolf? I finally find where I belong, and you try to steal that from me? Why would I ever go to the Prawn with you after what you did? Am I? You're beautiful, Addie, but the same beautiful that you've always been. She's not a werewolf. Oh my gosh, boss, boss! We got a problem! - What? - The remote shorted out, and now the detonation timer's running. Well, shut it off! I can't. No, no! What have they done? Addison? The center of Zombie and Werewolf culture is in rubble, and I still don't have a pack. Attention, everyone. This is your new president, Bucky reminding you that the Prawn is tomorrow night. As you know, with the anti-monster laws still in place, this is a human only event. They were wrong to destroy Seabrook power, and I was wrong about werewolves. You have every right to fight for who you are. Yeah, but what are we now, zombie? You're fierce, proud werewolves. Yeah, they think we're monsters. We are monsters. Thank you, sir. After you. What's that? It's zombies! And werewolves. In formal wear? They look good. You guys can't be here. There are laws against this. Bad laws are meant to be broken. And monsters don't follow the rules. Zombies are a part of Seabrook, Bucky. And we deserve to be here. We're a part of Seabrook, too. The originals, in fact. Someone's gotta stop you. Welcome to Prawn. Bonzo! Yes. I'll go to Prawn with you! Addison. I had no right to take your necklace to stop you from becoming a werewolf. I couldn't handle the fact that you might be a monster, 'cause I couldn't accept the fact that I am one. I thought everything would make sense if I was a werewolf, but I'm not. And I don't even know if I'm a cheerleader. You're a leader, Addison. You make others belong. At camp, at cheer practice. You're the one protesting for what's right. You bring people together. ♪ You're from the perfect paradise ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ And I'm living on the darker side ♪ ♪ Ooh, I had a feeling if you got to know me ♪ ♪ Right from the start you caught my eye ♪ ♪ And something inside me came to life ♪ ♪ Ooh, I've got a feeling ♪ ♪ Now you really know me ♪ ♪ Someday ♪ ♪ This could be, this could be ordinary ♪ ♪ Someday ♪ ♪ Could we be something extraordinary ♪ ♪ You and me side by side ♪ ♪ Out in the broad daylight ♪ ♪ If they laugh, we'll say ♪ ♪ We're going to be someday ♪ ♪ Someday, someday ♪ ♪ We're gonna be someday ♪ ♪ Someday, someday ♪ ♪ We're gonna be someday ♪ This way!

So it's only buried and not destroyed. We have to get to it. Quickly, while we still can. It's this way. I see the light. It's coming from Seabrook Power. Here it is! We have to move it out of here. Legend says that together, our pack can move the stone. All of us, lift! It's too heavy. There's not enough of us. Then maybe you need to expand your pack. Addison? We came here to help. Come on, everyone. We got this! Right. Hurry, before it's too late! Together lift! Chamber's collapsed. We can't carry the moonstone through. Your Z-band, it's still broken. Zed, take it off. Lift the slab. Okay, Zed, you can do this. I'm not ready. What if I can't control it? Oh! Zed, you have to. Yes! Come on, you can do this. Oh, no! Zed! Zed! Are you okay? Yeah. I'm me. We crushed it! We nailed it! We so rock! Yes! Too much? Perfect. We did it. Say "brains." Brains! We're getting our first zombie on the Prawn wall of fame. Hey, you said that perfectly.
