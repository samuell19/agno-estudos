It's been two years since my father, the count of Aguiar was dead. Mom had to take over the problems of the stately home... and our education. I can still remember the murmur of her rosary and her almost ghostly presence at the back of the living room. She was a typical woman of the south. There's no doubt that she could never get used to these mists... ... much less to the solitude that surrounded us. I can't forget her hand caressing Beatriz and me. Always wearing a black glove to hide the fact that she lacked two fingers. That was my last winter in the stately home. That morning, as I was walking through the forest ... Where are you going so fast, young man? I was returning to my house, sir. Aren't you Juan Aguiar, Doña Carlota's son? Yes, I am. What are you doing so early here? I was hunting birds. Don't do anything to me, please. My mother doesn't know I'm here. A Barbanzon can't be a coward. - Come on, give us the money. -I have nothing, I swear. Then why were you running? I'd think you've seen the devil. I saw him. He was hooded like a friar. -So you saw a friar, huh? -I swear, sir. - Was he leaving or coming? - He was coming. If you tell the truth, we'll let you go. If not, we'll cut your throat. I'm telling the truth, but he looked like a ghost. Well, we don't give a damn as long his bag is full. - And where did you see him? - He was heading for the bridge. Heading for the bridge, huh? Let me go. No, you're coming with us. Come on. Father. Father. Father, you're sent by Providence. A man is dying... ... and does not want to leave this world with his many sins. Come, father. Come. He's coming! He's coming! This way. Hurry up, father. Spit it out! God has sent a holy man ... ... so you can cleanse your soul. What are your sins, son? I've got many, father, many. And they're huge. - Is he mute? - No. Then let him speak. I was a sinner. I have killed, I have stolen, I have fornicated ... ... I've had bad thoughts. I haven't done one good thing in my life. I'm damned. But I repent, father. I repent. Bless me. Bless me. So you have killed. How many have you killed? So many that I don't remember their names. I killed them all while they were sleeping or relieving themselves... What about women? What about the ones you fornicated with? Well, I remember some of them. And I raped them all. I have travelled around the world, ... but I didn't have to overcome such great temptations. Anyway, father... ... it's better that you kneel down and say a prayer for him. We understand that you are tired. - Are you coming from far away? - I'm coming from the Holy Land. I thank God for bringing you here. Kneel down and pray. In the name of the Father, of the Son, of the Holy Spirit ... You can go, boy. And don't say a word if you appreciate your life. You can't make such a trip without a full bag ... And there's nothing better for a soul in danger than a sacrifice. Lord forgive those who are going to die ... ... and to kill! Where are you coming from, Juan? Your mother is looking for you. You'll be for it when you get home! And don't say you've seen me! How is he? He's ill. Poor fellow. The devil brings them and God takes them. You speak like a priest. Don't forget he's our son. He's yours. I don't know if he's mine. I'm going to see the healer. She'll heal him. Forget about witches and heal me. No ... No ... While my mother and those old women murmured their supplications... ... I was overcome with a strange feeling ... ... one of those subtle feelings that fill your soul with uneasiness ... ... and your common sense strives vainly to reject ... It was as if an unknown threat was lying in wait. And that threat was looming ... over all of us. Particularly over my sister Beatriz. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners. Now and at the hour of our death, Amen. Mary full of Grace ... ... the Lord is with you. Blessed are you among all women and blessed is the fruit of your belly, Jesus. What's the matter, Beatriz? Nothing, mother. I was cold. I'm Basilisa the 'Calinda', Doña Carlota's maid. My son is dying. Come closer, daughter. Come closer. Your son... ... he has a black cat in his cradle. The cat's claws are scratching his soul. The child is bewitched. He's going to die. I can't do anything. I'm old. My powers have abandoned me. I still have science. But science is not enough. Only the devil can save your son. But you will have to offer him an innocent soul... ... as a dwelling for the cat that scratches ... ... and scratches ... ... and scratches. What can I do then? I don't want my son to die. I would give my soul to the devil to save him, but my soul is already damned. What can I do? Listen to me. Listen carefully. At the stone of the door, ... somebody left a present. Take it. Carry it. Take it with you and put it on the pillow of the person ... ... where the black cat must dwell ... ... when he leaves your child's body. Open the door. May the peace of the Lord come in with me in this house. I would like, Countess ... to humbly propose to you to take care of your garden in exchange for a bed and frugal food. If you're sent by heaven, my house welcomes you. Come now... What are you doing here? Come on, go away. Beatriz, Beatriz. What's the matter Juan? I can't sleep. I'm scared. What are you afraid of? I went to the forest yesterday to hunt birds and I saw ... Come on, what did you see? That friar is a demon. He killed three of Lorenzo el Quinto's men on his own. He has a very long sword. He approached one of the dead men, ... cut his ear and kept it in a bag. Poor Juan. I saw it, Beatriz. - I am very afraid. - You had a bad dream. It wasn't a dream, I saw it. His name was Fray Angel. He had come back from the Holy Land. He wanted to sleep with the servants, ... although my mother insisted that he had to live with us because he was a representative of the Church. I appreciate the generosity with which I have been welcomed, ... but I don't consider myself a representative of the Church. I'm just a candidate to earn heaven in my earthly life. Mr. Bretal, Mr. Bretal. Hello Juan. Have you revised your lessons? Yes sir. Maximo Bretal, a student, used to come three days a week ... ... from a farm near Monforte, to teach me latin and put the library in order. He had been recommended to my mother as a charity, by the priest. The presence of the student at home relieved my apprehensions ... ... but it didn't relieve me of the heavy chains of my childhood. Latin during the day, fear at night ... ... and that friar with a twisted language, ... hardly intelligible for my childish mind. When I heard him talk the whole world seemed like a mistake. And I wondered ... ... why God had created it. That's what my mother told him. Because it's not a mistake, but a test, but we, with our pride, we only ask questions. We don't realize that creation is the question ... and we, despite our smallness, ... are the answer. The friar speaks a lot. Does he have so much to say? Pulpit stuff. He speaks about plants, birds ... ... I don't know! But Miss Beatriz is fascinated by what he says. I've been told a lot about him. He was one of those tonsured leaders who stole the silver from the churches to help their faction. After the war was over, they kept on saying mass for the soul of Zumalacarregui. Flowers are his latest craze. Does it work? Be careful ... Be careful. He says the world is rotten. And I'm glad to hear it. With so much dignity and purity, you'd think sinning is not natural. And speaking of sins, how's your blacksmith? I prefer real sins... ... to simple thoughts. What would you do to Miss Beatriz, ... if you were allowed to? To her or her mother! Look at the small-time student! You can fool doña Carlota... ... but not me, I know you. You have your books, but we are the same after all. There you go. Satan! Satan! I conjure you for my evil thoughts. My evil deeds. For all my sins. Come without delay ... ... and take that cat away from my son's body. I was looking for my cat. Have you seen it? No, I haven't seen it. I can't find it anywhere. Would you like me to help you? I wouldn't want to distract you. Cats are very independent animals. From time to time you must let them live their own life. He'll come back when he's hungry. When will you finish classifying the books? In spring. Or later. Your mother wants a complete inventory ... ... and that's not easy. I'm glad you will be staying with us for such a long time. And I'm glad you're glad. Although you have some company now. That friar ... Well, he's different. He's a man of God. Listen ... Don't you hear him? Don't you hear him scratching? Well ... Well no. I can't hear anything. Sometimes he climbs up the shelves and hides among the books. He destroys them and sharpens his claws with the paper. But that's impossible. I would have seen it. And now, don't you hear him now? No, I don't hear anything. You're right. He's not scratching anymore. After all these years... ... I still can't understand the strange influence ... ... that friar exerted over us. My mother listened to him with respect and devotion. I was afraid of him as if he wasn't from this world. The worst of it ... ... was that Beatriz seemed to be fascinated by him. I was a child and I couldn't understand that. They say that in Galicia the souls ... ... still keep their eyes open for miracles ... ... and for terror, too. What are you looking at, Juan? Is this the way you study? Why are you not in the kitchen? It's cold in here. In the forest I saw that friar ... ... kill three of Lorenzo el Quinto's men. Beatriz doesn't believe me. That friar is the devil. You're cold. Come on, come closer. That's it. That's it. Come on, tell me what's the matter. He's the devil. You shouldn't think those things. I'm scared at night. I see him pray on his knees. He's so still. I can't sleep. The next time this happens to you, come to my room ... ... and I'll make you sleep. Lonely thoughts are not good. Mum! Mum! Mum, Beatriz is not in her room. Her bed is empty. And the cat was carrying the ear the friar took from the dead man. What are you saying, Juan? Come on, son, wake up, you're dreaming. No, I'm not dreaming, mum. You tell me I'm dreaming but I'm not. I know you're not lying, Juan. You think you've seen what you say. Calm down. Beatriz! Calm down. - Calm down. - I called you! - Daughter! - I called you, you didn't hear me! Calm down! I called you! It's that cat! That cat! Take this cat away from me! Beatriz ... The boy is cured. He hasn't got a temperature anymore. Father, I'd like you to see Beatriz. She's very ill. I thought maybe you could do something to save her. The only thing I can do ... ... is to raise my prayers to heaven. Don't leave me ... I'm scared, Fray Angel. Last night I came to believe that the devil had possessed her. I was filled with fright when I heard her scream. Go away. What are you doing here? - Hi. - Hello Juan. - Good afternoon sir. - What 'sir' are you talking about? I only see a boy and a scoundrel. And the scoundrel's name is Maximo. Tell me, what are you looking for? I'm looking for you. Here I am. That friar is the devil. I haven't met any friar who is not a devil ... ... or a devil who is not a friar. He killed three men, but nobody believes me. Well, I don't think that's incredible. I think you fall short. I can't sleep ever since he arrived. And my sister, as you know, she has fallen ill. I would heal her with ham and wine. And a little cheerfulness, that's what you need. Yes sir. I thought that being a man of letters, ... maybe you have read about some remedy for my sister. Don't look for remedies in books. The wisest men only know ... ... that they don't know anything, so ... ... we can spare it all and speak like ignorant people. So, would you believe me if I tell you that my sister ... ... was in the garden with the friar ... ... and then she was screaming in bed ... ... and the cat was carrying the ear? You don't have to swear, I believe you. Well, I don't know what happened, but my sister fell ill. And if things keep on like that, I will, too. It's not as bad as all that. Everyone knows friars bring illness. And that books don't cure them. The most important thing ... ... is keeping away from friars and books. They say I dreamed it, but I saw it with my own eyes. That makes no difference either, ... since poets say that life is a dream. Don't you think she's bewitched? She's bewitched, because she wants to be. The whole Santa Compagna couldn't bewitch me. I would talk to my mother, but she doesn't believe me ... I'm desperate, Mr. Maximo. I don't know what to do. Well then tell your mother that I know a book ... ... about this case and its remedy. And if she wants, we could use it and see what happens. Which book is that? This one. "He will kill the strongest and the healthiest men. By his cunning ... ... he shall make deceit prosper under his hand. He will rise up against the Prince of princes. That's what Daniel told King Nebuchadnezzar". Well, I don't know if that will work, but trying won't do any harm. I've heard about a healer who cures desperate cases. Bring her. I don't know if I'll be able to bring her. But I'll do my best ... ... to help ... ... Miss Beatriz recover. My Lady begs you to go see her. I regret what I did. My son is cured and I don't want to lose him. But I also can't stand ... ... seeing Miss Beatriz in that condition. Then, get rid of the spell. Remove it from the pillow. Miss Beatriz will live. But your son will die. No... My God. What can I do? Choose. My son. Even though I'm damned. Don't think you're killing her, ... or that you could avoid her death. You're just a poor woman. What should I tell doña Carlota? Tell her I'm old and I can't walk. Lord, forgive me. You know my heart. Mum. She has just fallen asleep. Mum, I want to talk to you. I've talked to him in the library, ... and he says he knows a book. That book says ... ... that someone must die. I'll speak to Maximo Bretal tomorrow. Mr. Bretal, I want to pay you what I owe you. And I beg you from this moment on ... ... to never set foot in this house again. With your absurd stories you arouse ... ... my son's imagination. You have gotten above yourself. Leave. I just answered his question. That's my only fault and I'm willing to leave. But remember, Madam. When a child asks a question you have to answer him. Wait. What did Juan ask you? He wanted a remedy for his sister. And you know that remedy? - No. - Then you deceived him. You made him believe that ... I picked up a random book and I told him what the book said. And that's not better or worse than the words of a friar ... ... or the prayers of an overpious woman. You are an insolent! I say what I think. And Juan needs someone telling him what he thinks ... ... instead of telling him all those lies ... ... that make him feel so lonely in this house ... ... where everybody is alone. You lack love of life. And now, goodbye Madam. Wait! What you just said is very serious. How dare you criticize my behaviour ... ... and the rules I have imposed ... ... and kept for many years in this house? I don't want an order that looks so similar to death. - Goodbye. - Wait! I owe you your salary. Give it to the Church for the salvation of sinners. Although I doubt that with that miserable sum you could even save an innocent. You're so arrogant! I took you because you didn't have anything. You begged me for bread. And now you reproach me for what I gave you ... ... when nobody, listen good, nobody wanted to see you? It was an act of kindness and God will reward you for that. But don't expect me to be grateful. Mr. Bretal ... I beg you not to leave. Juan needs you. I apologize. It's me who should apologize. If I can still be useful ... ... I'll stay in this house. Then eat up your soup. It's getting cold. Did you visit the healer? Yes, I visited her. And what did she tell you? Nothing, Madam. She's very old, she has lost her powers. She can't even move. What did the doctor in Santiago say? He has only been able ... ... to make her sleep as if she was dead. But I see he hasn't been able to stop her dreaming. Our father who art in heaven ... ... make my sister heal. And I promise you that I will behave like a man. And that I won't hunt ... ... the birds in the forest anymore, or let Basilisa make me warm. Were you praying? No, I was looking for a penknife. It fell. Come, let's have dinner. - With the friar? - Yes, with the friar. - I don't want to go! - What are you saying? Come out. Come here. Come on, come here. Did you sleep well last night? No, I didn't. Did you hear your sister's screams? Yes, I heard them. Why didn't you come to my room? I wouldn't do anything to you. Come on, come and have dinner. So you don't like the friar. No. Why? I don't understand what he says or why he's here. Your mother says God brought him. Well, if God brought him, he must take him. I don't want to have dinner with him. Come on, don't be like that. You have to be an obedient boy. Come on. Father, leave me alone ... Father ... Yes ... He has come here ... To my room ... I called you ... But you didn't hear me ... I didn't want it ... I didn't want it ... Father ... Beatriz ... I want to talk to you. I need you to tell me the whole truth. It's useless to try to hide it. Beatriz has spoken. I hope you'll convince me that it was just a nightmare. It's a nightmare. But it's also true. Your daughter is possessed by the devil. I can feel her calling me. No, the devil is not her, but you. If I am the devil to her, she is the devil to me. Swear you haven't been alone with her. I don't know. - You have to know. - I don't know, I don't know! I see her, I feel her! I've had her in my arms! But I don't know if it was real. I swear, I don't know. But I would like to know. No, I'm not a saint. I've never been a saint. I was born for war. I'll leave tonight. Keep still! I got you! I was looking for you. I went to your room but I didn't find you. I'm glad that you came to see me. - I haven't come to see you. - Is that so? Well, what were you doing here then? Were you spying on the conversations of the grown ups? I'm going to tell your mother. No, don't tell her. Come, I want to speak to you. You're shaking. Are you scared? I'm not scared, I'm cold. When you were little, I used to let you sleep in my bed. Come, sit here. Come on, cover yourself up. I want to tell you something. But you must promise me that you won't tell anybody. I know what's wrong with your sister. But I can't do anything for her. A witch cast a spell on her. Her room is under a spell. You must go and remove it. I can't do anything for her ... ... because I'm a sinner ... ... and God would punish me. But you're innocent ... ... and God will forgive you. I'm a sinner too, but I'll do it even if God punishes me. What are you saying? You've never hurt anybody! And where is that spell? - Do you know? - Yes. I know. It's inside the pillow. Is it by any chance the ear ... ... Fray Angel cut off from one of Lorenzo el Quinto's men? Gosh! Did you see him? I saw him cutting it ... ... and I saw the cat taking it away. What? When was that? The cat? The night Beatriz fell ill. I went into her room, and saw the cat carrying the ear in his mouth. Then there's no spell! And my son is healthy? Is it true? I swear I saw it. I would do anything for you. Come on, let me ... Why didn't you tell me before? Why? What for? Nobody believes me! From now on, I'll believe everything you tell me. Come on, be an obedient boy. Let me. Come here. Come ... Keep still ... Still ... Juan... Keep still. What are you doing, Beatriz? Lie down. Now you'll get well, and everything will be as it used to be. A very furious man has arrived. Is he wounded? Wounded yes, but not in my body. I need help You? Help? What can I do for you? I'm a poor old woman, and you're full of strength. That's the problem. It's easy for old people to be virtuous. Old age brings us wisdom and holiness. But how can you stop your urges when you're alive? I have balsams and ointments that can turn a bull into a lamb. What virtues can God find in a handful of herbs? Which task is in store for me? I would confront a whole army ... ... but ... ... I can't defeat myself! Stop crying like a slut, and tell me what you want. If you know it, you'll get it ... ... and I'll be able to help you. But if you don't know it, how can I help you? I don't know. But you have to help me. Is it a woman? Yes. Who? She's a child. What's her name? Beatriz. I can cast a spell. What for? To make her come to you. Do it! Take the black bag. Lie down and chew. And dreams will show you the way. Well, that's fine. Do you understand anything? Nothing. That's a bad sign, because neither do I. Watch out, my mother is coming. Excuse me Mr. Bretal. I'd like to speak to you in private. I knew it was then ... ... that was decided to send me to Santiago, ... with my aunt and uncle. Beatriz was no longer screaming. She didn't have hallucinations. But she wasn't any better. The presence of Fray Angel had made her ill. Although he had left ... ... he seemed to have taken ... ... Beatriz with him. My mother didn't know what to do. Beatriz... Beatriz... Father ... Father ... Don't leave me! Don't leave me! In the name of the desecrated rosary, ... come without further delay and in the circle of Solomon ... ... shut yourself up, until I ask for everything I have to ask ... ... and you give what you have to give. I don't want spells! I don't want you to bring her to me! Okay... When I have to do what I have to do, ... I'll do it alone! Do you want some sleeping herbs? I don't want to go to Hell asleep. Beatriz... Beatriz! Beatriz! What is this? A joke? Come on! Look at that. If she screams, I'll cut her throat. You'll have to do everything we say ... ... Countess. And in silence. For starters, we want to eat. We're hungry. For starters, ... remove that sickle from my daughter's neck. Untie her ... ... and let her go to sleep. She shouldn't be awake at this time. Come on, you've heard her. Fly away, little bird. Open your beak. Stay in your room, Beatriz. Put the bolt across and don't go out. I'll deal with these gentlemen. Remove that from there. Yes, Countess. Keep still! That's mine. What are you doing here, Mr. Bretal? I was waiting for the rain to stop. These gentlemen come from a party and have wanted, like you, shelter from the rain. And also like you, they're very hungry. So let's sit down and start eating. You, move it. Well, Madam ... I think the rain is stopping and it's time for me to leave. For heaven's sake, don't go out with this downpour. Stay with us. What Mr. Bretal wanted to say, is that he's going to get some wine from the cellar. Go with him so that he's not loaded down. So are you people ... ... Lorenzo el Quinto's terrible men? Are we that easily recognizable, Madam? Who else could you be? We are, yes. But ever since el Quinto died, we are nothing. Winters are getting harder. and that forces us, like wolves, ... to come down to the villages. We're not up to serious misdeeds, if it's not necessary, Countess. But we can be dangerous if need be. I don't doubt that. And how did it occur to you to pay me this visit? It's an idea that has been in our heads for some time now. But you had that devilish friar, ... and we waited until he left. We were not afraid of him. We just wanted to avoid complications, ... and unnecessary deaths. A prudent measure. But now that the friar is gone, ... I'm going to order three mastiffs from Barbanzon. The friar is not far from here. Where is he? In the healer's mill house. He lives there. And someday we'll give him his due. The fire is going out. Throw the puppet! Which one? First the friar and then the lawyer. It's mine! It's mine! Leave it! Forgive us, madam. - Up and down. - It was mine! We are vulgar people. We're used to do and say what we want. My husband sometimes praised Lorenzo el Quinto. He admired the noble behaviour of the members of his band. Apparently, they could be very gentlemanly ... ... to the ladies. Not always, madam. It depends on the lady. She must ask for respect, not us. It's better for her, not for us. Keep still! Please Mr. Bretal, behave yourself. I can defend myself. Meanwhile ... ... these men are still my guests. If my presence here is not necessary, and since it has stopped raining, I'm leaving. - No! - You stay here! We will be the first to leave ... ... before dawn. We rely on your discretion, Countess. So that nobody knows what has happened here tonight. That's not what we agreed. Let the children sleep, madam. Tie him. We don't want any quarrel when he wakes up. Be careful. What you do, can cost you your lives. Don't worry, ... Countess ... We have come to satisfy our hunger ... ... not to be garrotted. I'm cold. What are you doing? Stupid! Keep still! If you water a plant, it grows. You'll have what you expect. Don't hurry. If you are the boss, hold your men back! And who holds me back, Countess? Do you want money? Let go of me! This flute doesn't play! I spy with my little eye ... Release me! No! No! Release me! No! Don't! No! Watch out! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! All right, Countess. We're leaving. Goodbye. My regards, Countess. Be careful. One death never comes alone. Get out. Get out of here! Get out! He shouldn't hear you. Come on! Hurry up! We must do it before he wakes up. Come out, friar of the devil! Here we are! Get out at once! Why have you come? I came because you called me. Get out of here. Go back to your house. Do as I tell you! Coward ... Beatriz returned home. Two weeks later, I left the stately home forever. I can still hear ... ... Mr. Bretal's last words. What's Santiago like, Mr. Bretal? You'll like it. You'll meet all kinds of people. And you'll learn that the things you have to defend ... ... are less important than the ones you have to get.
