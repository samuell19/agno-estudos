[static radio noise and police sirens] [dramatic music] [water spraying] [emergency vehicle sirens] [dramatic music] [TV reporter muffled talking] [Voiceover] Traffic is backed right up. There's an accident on the freeway. [dramatic music] [flames crackling] [Voiceover] The fire we were reported is still burning out of control. [dramatic music] [radio operator talking] [dramatic music] All right. I'll see you next week. [dramatic music] It's all on the line here. No time left on the clock. Just one shot, he checks the wind. Final adjustment. And he lets it fly. And it's good. The crowd goes wild. That's a flag on the field. Calling the ref. And the play stands. Game over. Woo. Yeah. Woo. [dramatic music] [leaking gas hissing] [dramatic music] [alarm buzzing] Morning sweetie. How's it feel to be officially old enough to drive? First stack has your name on it. When did he get home? I don't know, late. He tried to make it. You have to know that. Whatever, I don't care. I'm not hungry. Come on, you used to love 'em when you were little, humor me. Happy belated honey. Don't look at me. She stayed up waiting for you last night. I was on my way out, I had my keys in my hand and I was steps away from the elevator. Let me guess, Michael pulled you back in. All those extra hours fatten his bottom line, not yours. The better Michael does the more secure my job is. I still think you could take all that time and open your own firm. We both know I'm the guy who works for somebody. No, we don't. You convinced yourself of that. When she starts talking to me again, I'll make it up to her and you. You missed her sweet sixteen, Colin. I wouldn't hold your breath. I know you're doing your best. It's just hard to see your best going to him and not us. Morning Mr. Davis. Good morning Jack. Thank you. Nice morning for a ride. I'm just waiting until I can upgrade to a Porsche, just like Mr. Hollander. You might have to wait a few years before that. I figure five to seven years. Finish my internship, and then one promotion each year until I'm an account exec. Sounds about right. But let's start by nailing today's pitch and locking down this account. What do you say? [traffic noise] [people joking around] Alright, who challenged her this time? Hicks, he might have her. He fights dirty. What're you doing here? Aren't you suppose to be at home, being a dad. False alarm, again. I got it. I got it. Back me up. Baby? The kid doesn't want to come out. I got a drama queen already, she hasn't even been born yet. Oh it was a tie. -It was not a tie. -You both lose. Okay, maybe. What do you doing here? Why aren't you home with Joanne? Oh, my mother-in-law is in town. She's going to stay until the baby is born, so I just... Alright, well yeah. Enough said. Yeah, right, okay. I'll go see if Mr. Hollander is in. I wouldn't count on it. A bit early for him. Morning. It's too big. Whoa, good morning to you too. Sorry Claire, good morning. It's too big. And I liked the other one better where she is looking down with her eyes closed. That's what I thought too, but Michael said he likes this one. Have both ready. He'll change his mind and go with the original idea I pitched. That doesn't give me much time. The clients are going to be here in a few hours. I know, I know. That's why you're the best. You always pull it off. How did Sophie's party go? It was over before I got home. Wasn't the greatest morning at the Davis' household. What about the tickets? She must have forgiven you once you give her those. She was too mad to open it. Oh, let's nail this pitch and make it worthwhile. Oh, Hey Mr. D. don't worry, I'll be outta your hair in a sec. Look, when you're done with that, can you clear out some of the clutter just so it's out of sight for a a few hours. Yeah, you got it. Alright, thanks man, appreciate it. Don't know what we'd do without you. We're not ready, Colin, we're not ready. Michael said if we don't get this account he's gonna fire me. I know it. He told me, he thinks that I'm dead weight. Relax, Reese, we are ready. No one's getting fired. How can you be so sure? Because even if he doesn't ever admit it, we keep this place afloat. He should be here. Mom, he doesn't need to sit here and watch me every second. That's what you're here for. No, he'd rather sit there and horse around at a fire hall. It's his job. And I told him to go in today. Otherwise he goes crazy. Any little move I make he hits the alarm and thinks the baby is coming. If I go into labor, we'll call him and he will meet us at the hospital. What if he gets a call? It's going to be fine, mom. But just in case. [static radio chatter] What the hell is this? Contractors left a bit of a mess last night sir. And you're just cleaning it up now? We have clients coming. Get rid of it. I'm on it. Mr. D already asked me to do it, but I had to get the board room-- Well, you shouldn't have to be asked, uh, um-- It's Victor. I want this place spotless in ten minutes. I don't care where you put it, just get it out of here. Good morning, Mr. Hollander. Terrible. Is everything ready? Almost, we were here until after midnight last night, but I think we got it really-- What's this? The campaign you approved. No, my idea was the one with her eyes closed. It's my mistake. I told her the wrong one. We got the other one on standby. What's this? Looks like water. Fix it, now. They replaced the system to bring it up to code. It's probably just-- I don't care, just fix it. There's not much I can do until the tradesmen get here. It's leaking at the source. How long? A couple of hours at least. Client gets here in under an hour. Well, I'm sure they'll understand that we're in the middle of a renovation. They're not going to reject our presentation over that. Well, that's why my name is on the letterhead. I understand what it takes to run a successful business. You should know you only get one shot at a first impression. Can you turn the water off at the source? I can, but it's a safety violation. Can you? Yes, but I'd advise against-- Just do it. Just until the meeting is over. Fuck. [knocking] Everything is ready. Where's Jack? Your intern? I told him to sit in the break room until after the meeting. One look at him the client will run. What? Jack is a good kid. He works hard for us-- He still hasn't got my coffee right. Not once. Truly the important thing when looking for future potential in an ad exec. How much longer do we have him? Internship ends next month. Thank God. And then we can hire him as an assistant. Then we can find another free intern. Why would you pay for a set of hands that you can get for free? That's not exactly how an internships work. When we're done the renos we move into the other two floors, we are gonna need the help. If you don't want him I'll take him in my team. Your team's just doing as fine as it is. You'll manage, we're taking on more space for the impression. We want to have the impressive board room, the executive office that the clients are wowed by. We're not taking more space so that we can fill it with people that I will have to pay money to. Your team's big enough. More clients, less labor force? More clients, more profits. Which means more job security. We are not gonna be one of those companies that hires a bunch of people and then has to go to a round of layoffs when things go slow. That scares away clients faster than a peach-fuzzed intern. If you can't handle it, tell me now. I can handle it. Good. I want a full run down on today's pitch in ten minutes. Yes sir. When I was sixteen, my parents didn't even throw me a party. So, if you think about it, Sophie's lucky. I was lucky with boys the whole sweet sixteen thing is non-existent. David took him to get his driver's license. That was the really big deal. David was always good about stuff like that, he would always-- Claire relax, we've done the work, that's all you can do. So, we'll start off talking about-- I'll handle it. Uh, but we've each prepared our own part of the presentation. I'm going to take it from here. If I need you to answer a specific question. I'll address you. But we've done a lot of work and I think we want to hear from each department. I said I'd handle it. Go out front and make sure that whats-his-name has cleared out all that crap. They're gonna be here in fifteen minutes. Meet them at the elevator. No, go down the lobby, escort them up. That will be a nice touch. Want me to hold a sign up too? What? Nothing. Yes sir, no sir. Right away sir. It's Victor, how hard is that to remember? Guy can own his own ad company, but can't remember a damn name. Wow, ad exec and a hostess, nice. It's just Michael being Michael. Yeah, better get your smile ready. How's this? Like you want to murder someone. Maybe smiling is not your thing. Hello, yeah okay. [loud explosion] What the hell was that? Oh my God. We should get out of here. Reese! Reese, hey, hey, hey. Are you alright? What was it? I don't know. Come on, come on Can you stand? We gotta go, come on. We gotta go! Jack. Jack. She's dead. Help! Help! We've been set for two weeks. -Yeah. -Baby's late. It's going, bring it on. Yeah, they were painting Adrian was telling me. We got blues and pinks, you know? [bell rings] Alright people, let's go to work! Let's go guys. Joanne might need you today, maybe, just sit this one out? This is not the job we signed up for, you know that. Let's go! Woo, let's go guys. We got a fire. [sirens wailing] [phone ringing] You know the rules, bro. It's bad luck. Just give him a break, it's just one time. Hey! Call her when you get home. [radio chatter] I think it's starting. The contractions are back. Mom, what's wrong? We have a fire in a highrise structure. 17, ladder 17 respond to the scene. That's Ray's ladder. This breaking new just in from downtown... You see the way they're popping? It's gas. We gotta get into the basement, shut off the gas. Or they'll keep popping until she's nothing but ash. I'm on it. Fanshaw, Burns, you go with her! Whoa, Chief, that's my team, you know that. It's gotta be me, it's bad luck to change the teams. Let's go! Help! Help! Somebody, hello? The South exit! Come on, let's go, let's go. Help, somebody! Claire! Claire! Colin, Colin, I'm in here! Claire, we're coming! -Help. -We'll get you out! Colin. Hang tight, hang tight! Ah, Jesus. -Use your shirt! -My shirt? Use your shirt to open the door! Is the gas shut off from downstairs? Ready? Don't say it. He needs to change his priorities. His priorities are exactly where they should be. Ooh, no, no, no not yet. It can't come yet, we have to wait for Ray. It doesn't work that way. Okay, okay. [Voiceover] I don't know what the number is and as you can see there's crowds here, they've gathered, some have narrowly escaped the explosions and the fire... Hey baby. I know you're not going to get this till after but, it's happening. Don't worry about me, I am going to be fine, mom's with me. You just be safe. Love you. Claire you still there? Colin, Colin I'm in here! Get me out! That's it, that's it. We got it. We gotcha. Help. Colin, Colin, get me out of here. Get me out of here! We're gonna get ya. Oh my God, I'm gonna die. You're not gonna die, we gotcha. I'm gonna die, it's falling. -It's gonna fall. -It's not gonna fall. Take my hand. -It's gonna fall! -It's not going to fall. Take my hand! Take my hand! I can't, I can't! It's falling. Take my hand. Think of your son. Claire come on we're going to getcha out of here. Come on, just take my hand! You can do it. It looks good, come on! Think of your son, come on. We're going to getcha outta here. Let's go. Come on, come on. Okay. Let's go, let's go, let's go! Okay we gotta turn off the gas. This place is a ticking bomb. Michael! Michael! Michael! Michael! Head back to the board room, call 911, I'll get Michael. -I'll meet you there. -No, no, no. We should stay together. Someone needs to know we're alive in here. Go, go! Okay, okay we'll meet you there. Talk to me! What the hell is going on in there? Elevator crashed we got limited visibility. But we're almost at the gas shut off. Hoses are up, we're ready to go at her. Keep your heads up and watch for gas pockets! What started as a regular morning in this downtown office building, turned into a Deadly Inferno. As a series of explosions rocked the Hollander building on a corner of 179 and Main. Most of the people made it out in time, but reports of multiple people trapped on the 8th floor and numerous casualties are coming in. This may be the worst fire in the history of our city. Natia Patel, News 4, keeping you informed as this tragedy unfolds. The gasline should be that way. Got it. It's off. Okay, this is Vargas, the gas is off. I repeat that. The gas is now off. Alright, move. Roger that, the gas is off. Clear to get in there and take her head on. We need help, we're stuck in the fire. Yeah, yeah. We're on the eighth floor. I think your leg is broken, man. Michael, hey! You alright? Look, I'm going to make you a tourniquet okay? I'm going to get you outta here. You sit tight, all right man? I'm going to get you out of here. [Micheal groans in pain] Sorry man, sorry! Hey man, come on. Hey, hey. Hey, hey Michael! Hey, hey, hey. Look at me, man. Look at me all right? We're going to get you outta here! Victims from inside the building calling 911. Go ahead. Hello! You've got fire chief Clausey here. Who am I talking to? Help us, just get us outta here! Calm down, where are you? Eighth floor, board room. What's your name? Who is with you? I'm Reese Sterling, I am here with Claire Walters. Vargas! Vargas we've got people on the eight, repeat 8th floor. We've got people on the way stay low and keep your face covered. Are you on a cellphone? Yes. There's a gas leak in the building. Hang up and stay off anything cellular. Any spark could create another explosion. Okay, they're going to send people. How are they going to get to us? You saw it out there. The exits are blocked. Where's Colin? I don't know! Well, we should go back for him. We can't go back there, I need to call my son. I need to tell him I'm okay. No, no, no, no, no. No cellphones, he said there's a gas leak. No, I need to call him. I need to tell him, he's all alone. If anything happens... He'll have no one. Well then let's do anything we can to get out of here. Like not causing a spark that is going to blow us out of the window. Okay? Okay, okay. I got you, just walk with me. Okay, let's go in here. She'll get over it, I know mom. He's trying, he feels bad enough as it is. No, he does not need a phone call from you. Okay. Okay, bye. The situation at the Hollander building here is not looking good. I've just spoken to the chief and the problem is they're getting separated by collapsing floors and then the standard fire exits are being blocked by falling debris and raging fires. It's getting impossible to get in contact with the survivors. We really don't know... We're going up to the eighth! Let's get you a path through then. There's no time. We cut the gas so the combustion should be under control. There can still be pockets of gas that haven't combusted yet, just need a spark, we can dissipate it with the hoses. Maybe on the first two floors. But we gotta get up to eight. We'll just sweep lower levels. Roger that. [dramatic music] Let's go sit you down right here. Careful, careful I gotcha, I gotcha. Are you okay? Where's Jack? Claire and Reese are in the board room. I hope. Anybody else? Everyone else either got out or... Or they didn't. What do we do? I don't know I'm an ad exec, I'm not a fireman. Alright, I'm calling 911. Patch 'em through. Where are you? Uh, we're at the Southwest washroom at the eighth floor. Hold on. You're pretty boxed in there. Is there any way you can make it to the board room? There are other survivor there. If you can rendezvous with them, we can organize a rescue. My boss, his leg, he can't move. How many of you are there? I need names. There's two of us. Colin Davis, Michael Hollander. All right stay low and keep your face covered to avoid smoke inhalation. We're going to send someone to ya. Hang on, you're going to be okay. That is a long way between them. We got two more on the eighth floor. Washroom, south side. Okay, looks like it's on the way, we're going to grab them. Send them back with one of us and then head onto one of the others. Well you better hurry, from out here it ain't looking too good. Check the water pressure! I'm getting nothing. Hey Chief, the waterline is shot! We're going in without a hose. They're coming for us. They're coming. We need to be on the same page with everything. With what? The sprinklers. They can't know we turned the water off. We? That was your call Michael, you can't put that on us. You knew about it. You could've objected. You have no shame. You don't know how many other people are dead, and all you can think about is avoiding liability? Comes with being the head at the table. I need to think about what happens after today. Our jobs depend on it. You need to be thinking about Jack, who died following you out. And Cindy, the receptionist, dead under a pile of rubble. They died in your building, working for you, being treated like garbage every day for you. Even now you don't have a human emotion. I pity you, you know that? Are you sure it isn't resentment? For being the one willing to be the boss? You can't have it both ways, you can't be their friend, you can't be the nice guy and drive a business. You're so void of humanity you can't see they don't work for you, they work despite you. They come in here every day and put up with your demands and your moods. You sit quietly while you take credit for their hard work, because they have to, they have no choice. They have mouths to feed and people relying on them. But every night when they go home they do everything they can to not think about this place, until the next morning because that's the environment that you've created here. And you? Me too. Now I'm stuck in a burning building feeling guilty that I have missed my daughters birthday to prep for a presentation you were about to take credit for. What was I thinking? Well, if you've wanted out, you could have left any time. But you didn't because you knew there was a line of people willing to take your place. You're right, you're right. I can't quit, because I have to think about college tuition and mortgage payments and retirement. Not everyone was handed a trust fund and a business to run. Hate me for your place in life, but the way I see it, I'm the one providing for your family. I write all of the checks. I pay for all of you to live your lives. If you don't like it the way I do it start your own firm. And you do it with a smile and a friend circle chat around the water cooler every morning. Can you move? I don't know. Why? Because the last thing I want to do if we don't make it out here is spend that time with you. I'm getting out, after I find the others. You're letting it in, shut the door! Shut the door! It's impossible for us to get through that. We're going to cut through this floor to the South stairwell! We're following you. Wait, we gotta go back! It's too far! There's at least four people up there. Ray you wait here, we'll go grab them! No, no, no we go together or not at all. Right. Let's go. They're not going to be able to find us. We're going to die in here. We could try to go around to the back offices and get to a window. Maybe they can get a ladder to us? Or we can just hide here? I've been hiding my whole life. After my husband died I was so afraid to do anything. Afraid of losing my son, losing my job, losing everything. If I'm going out today it's not going to be hiding, it's going to be on the move. What do you say? Yeah, I'm more than happy to watch this place burn to the ground. We're not going to be in it. Colin! Colin! I need to speak to my husband, Colin. Colin Davis! What, what is it? He's, he's inside. We're trying to get to him. He's okay, he's trapped on the eighth floor. Trapped? What the hell does that mean, trapped! He's in there? He can't be! I spoke with him. -What, on the phone? -Yes. Well you need to call him. I need to speak to him! Ma'am, it's a gas leak. A call could cause a static spark that could ignite. We can't call him. But my team is in there. They'll get to him. [fire crackling] All right guys down the hall. Bathroom on the right. Fire department, is anybody in there? Is anybody in here? Fire department. Come on, inside, inside, let's go, let's go, keep it up. Everything all right, good? You okay? Yeah, no, I'm okay. He's hurt, his leg is hurt. We need a civilian hand off on seven, over. Where are the others? I know there's two people in the board room. Alright, where's the board room? It's down here to the right of the elevator. Okay let's head to the elevator. We can get him and come back to evac. No way. These two need to get out of here right now. We'll take them down hand them off then we come back to the board room. No, no. What if the path closes once we bring them down. We got to, we got to go now. Alex, he's right. We risk everyone if we try to get them all. Now what we need to do is get our hand off if we're going to get these guys out of here safely. Alright, we're moving them down. South stairwell. Let's get some water, it's getting hotter than hell. No. No way Hey guys, you'll need to come down to six. Seven is a lost cause. I think we're losing our window fast. Get him up Alex. Get them comfortable, on three, okay boss? One, two, three. Up. Okay, I'm going for the board room. You take them down, hand them off. No, no we bring them down together regroup and find another way to the board room. We might not have another chance. What are you trying to prove? I'm going. Ray? We will not-- There's no way we're getting through that! Let's go! Here Alex. Vargas come in! Ray, Ray come in. Where's Ray? What the hell happened? -Ray. -We're cut off, they re still up there. Vargas come in! Vargas answer me. Vargas where are you? Yeah, I'm here. Goddammit Ray, answer me. Alright, quit yelling! Just hang tight there buddy. We're coming to get you! Alright, get him outta here! Let's go. Go, go go! What the hell happened? Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ! Buddy, what the hell happened? Come on, come on! Oh shoot. Okay. We're on the sixth floor Southside stairwell. Fanshaw is down, it's bad. Come on, come on. We gotta move him now. Hey are you okay? I don't know I think so. Can they get to us? Yeah, yeah, of course. What the hell happened? We got cut off, Ray's still up there. Anyway to get him? Negative. The entire stairwell is wiped out beyond six. It's completely gone. Civilians? Yeah, yeah. We have one Michael Hollander. Colin Davis? He's on eight with Ray. There are still options. We'll get him out of there. So do it. Once you can get Fanshaw out, get the hell out here. We're going to have to try and go in from the outside. That's an order. Get the air vac ready. You got it chief. Ray, what's your status? We're pretty boxed in right now. She's burning through everything chief. Colin Davis. He's banged up but he's alright. Get him out of there! Let me talk to him! I need to speak to him! Get him on the radio, I need to speak to talk to my husband! Every second counts. If I let you talk to him, it could distract him, or break his focus. Let my man bring him out safe. You have to trust me on this. Alright, I am going to be honest with you. I don't know what to do right now. We can't go this way, can't go by the stairwell. They're not coming for us, are they? Well not from the inside, we got to get to a place on the outside, that they can get to us. Well we need to find the others first, if they're still here. It's their only chance to get out. I'm not going to risk your life by going on a hunt for them. It's so hot on my feet. You? Yeah. We're almost at the north stairwell. Maybe we can-- Reese! The fire is too hot under you. Yeah, we can feel that. I'm going to need you to break the number one rule. We're going to have to go up. Up. A rooftop extraction could be our only option. What if we crawl through here. Alright, we'll get back to you with an extraction ETA. Don't touch that, that's hot. Alright, I am going to give my jacket. Put it on, try not to touch anything. What about you? Are you going to be okay? Don't worry about me, I'll be alright. Alright, put this on, try to stay low. Try not to touch anything. It's going to be hot! Ah. Ah, it's not going to hold. Come on man let's hurry. This thing is going to drop, come on! Come on! He's losing a lot of blood! Get a med evac ready for Fanshaw. We're coming down. Do it now! Okay! Fire crews have been battling the blaze with little success. Mom? Mom, I'm home. We got off early. We had some assembly thing at school. Mom? ...the extent of casualties at this point, but there have been fatalities in the building. Our reports confirm there are currently one firefighter and two office employees on the eighth floor fighting for their lives. Dad. Some are family members looking for people who will never come out of there. But what has been confirmed at this point by the fire chief, there are still people inside. One fire fighter and two or more office employees, trapped on the eighth floor. Michael, let me through, let me through. Hang in there Fanshaw. Did you see him? Did you see Colin, is he okay? He saved me. He's still in there, and you're out here free and clear. Just like any other day. You just take, and take, and take. It should be you up there! Not my husband. He wanted to go after the others. Must be so easy not to give a damn. You to let everyone else suffer for your gain. No it's not fair, it's not fair. He's still up there! You should be in there. Get my husband! We're trying! We're trying! Chief it's my fault. I thought we could separate and maybe go after the other people. Now Ray's up there because of me. He's up there because it's what we do. No. No, this one's on me. I don't know what I was trying to prove. Hey, it was a freak fallout, alright? There's nothing more. Get your harness on and get up there and bring them home. Vargas, what's your status? Status Vargas. Are you on route to the roof? He'll be there. Claire. Reese. The fire wouldn't open the door. My guess they got out. We gotta find them. What we need to do is get to the roof. We're running out of time. Alright, we're not leaving without them. Okay, we'll survey the floor. If we can't find them, we gotta get back up to the roof. Okay. This way, this way. Mom! Mom! Mom. Where's dad? Mom. Mom. Honey, oh honey. Where's dad, he's in there? He's alive, but we don't know where he is. He's going to be okay, right? Of course, they're going to get him out safe and sound. It's just that, I was so mean to him today. It's okay, it's not your fault. I just want him to be okay. He will be. Colin. Claire. I saw the board room, I thought you might've, Where's Reese? Are you sure? He's gone, he fell into the fire. We have to go! We have to get out of here! We're going to get out of here, we're going to get out of here! You're here to get us out? Yeah, we can't go that way. We gotta goto the roof. We gotta stay ahead of the fire, stay ahead of the heat. Once this floor goes, we gotta go up. Is there any other way to the roof? Uh, one floor up there's access to the roof. We can't use the stairs. It's not an option. Neither is the elevator. But the elevator shaft should be solid. We gotta get across. How? What's that for? We're gonna make a door. Wait, wait, wait, wait! No, I'm not getting in there. Claire, we got to get to the roof It's the only way. I'm not getting in there. We gotta get you on that ledge. We're outta time. Take my hand. Come on, you can do it. You can do it. I'm going to go first, all right? Okay, okay. Okay, Claire, you can do it take my hand. Take my hand, you're just going to step on that ladder. Right there, then there's a ledge here. You can do it, I got you. There you go, yup. There you go, good. Over here, just step on that ledge. You can hold here. You got it, you got it, you'll be fine. All right. We're going to get out of here, we're going to get out of here. How do you know that? Because I am going to be a father for the first time. I'm not going to miss my little girl being born. So just stay close to me, we're going to get out of here okay. When's she due? Two weeks ago. Nothing but false alarms. Mine was two weeks early. Mine was early too. Your wife is due and you're in here with us, why? My mother-in-law is in town. Now honestly, how could I watch my little girl being born knowing that her father could have been saving the life of somebody else's father. I'm sure your wife would disagree. No, she knows the man she married. She'd tell me to go back out there and don't come home until you got everybody out safe. So, what do you say. We get the hell outta here, maybe tonight's the night my little girl is going to be born, huh? Claire, get behind me. Colin, you get behind her. Slow and steady, one step at a time. Don't look back, don't go down. I'm good. Okay, that's the best thing I've heard all day. Sounds good to me. I've got a sweet sixteen to make up for. You sure your people are going to be there when we get to the roof? They'll be there. Just like you were there for your people. You wouldn't stop, they'll be there for us. They weren't my people, they're Michael's people. I work for him, just the same as they do. You really think that? You're the reason why we work so hard why we don't quit. It's not Michael, he's not our leader you are. Alright, this is the top floor. Nice and easy. I gotcha. Okay? -You good? -Yeah. Run. We gotta get out of here! Alright, like I said here comes the air rescue. Oh thank God. He can only take us one at a time. Alright, Claire, you're going first. No, Colin. Claire, you're going first. Okay, come here. We're gonna get you out of here. Okay. Put one foot on this side. Now the other. That's great. Does that feel secure? Grab onto me. Get one hand on the rope, okay? Let's go. This roof is getting hot. How long before this whole building blows? Long enough. Put this on. Left foot, right foot. All right. I'm so sorry dad. I'm sorry. Alright, things are going to be different. I opened your present. I wouldn't miss it. Ray. Yeah, it's me. Should I call you daddy? Daddy? Oh. She's beautiful. Are you on your way? No, I can't, I can't make it quite yet. Why are you calling, it's bad luck to? Hey, you uh... Ray. Give my little girl a kiss for me, alright? I'm coming. Hey I'm coming, I'm coming. I'm so proud of you. I'm coming. Ray? Give me a second, okay? I'm sorry. He was, I'm sure you know what he was. It should have been me. He should be out here. You know I didn't know him for very long, but I bet you anything he'd disagree with you. I don't know what makes a person to run into a burning building to save a stranger. But I do know I am a better man because of it. [sad downtrodden music]
