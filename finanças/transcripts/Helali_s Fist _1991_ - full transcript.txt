Son please, you destroyed all the pillows! - Forgive me. Come in, the breakfast is ready! Sit down son, and eat slowly. - Sorry, I'm late. Will you also eat standing up? Going to the bank to cash Dad's insurance, it took us too years to get it. Will you be late at the hospital tonight? - Hopefully, I can leave early. See you. - Good bye. Goodbye Mom. - Bye. Take care of yourselves. - Goodbye mom 7 years passed quickly right, “Weed”? - Weed?! This nickname is over I've gone straight, 7 years were too long I hope you are honest or you will be visiting us again. No way! I'm an honest man now! I want to believe you. But remember, if you deal again you won't escape me! No need for this Sir, I'm done with crime, nothing is better than honesty I don't want to see your face again! Go! Thank you sir. Weed, my darling! - I can't believe it, I'm free again! So, did you finish your sentence or couldn't they stand you no more? They released me for good behavior! - Do you expect me to believe that? And where's Lolo? - They are all waiting for you. We'll party tonight, I'm paying! - Let's go! Good morning. - Good morning. How are you today? I'm fine thanks to you doctor. - To her only? There's no one at the hospital like her. You asked for it. - That's OK, I'm not angry. Take a breath. - May God bless you child. Won't you pray for me too? - You want part of everything! Once we're married you should quit, I don't want to share you I will annoy you at home and here too! - I love you. Me too. What you're doing, we are at work! OK, I will wait until we are at home I'm here! - I was waiting I love your apartment, great place. You are great. Every time I come here I feel like it's the first time. Let's start again.

I'ill get you a new father from duty free! Come on! Laugh! It's sad that he died before I could open the Disco. You know if I had the money I'd lend it. And who told you we are broke? - What do you mean? We will open that Disco! Are you crazy? Would cost a fortune to turn this thid dump into a disco. Don't worry, I have the money. Are you planning a robbery? Or you want us in it? Why steal when I have plenty left from last job? Son of a bitch! Why did you think I waited 7 years, and was released for good behavior? With this money, we'll gamble, bootleg liquor, deal weed, and get rich! Drink Lolo! Drink AboRokba! To the future! Didn't I say honesty is the best policy?! Good night! - Wait 10 mins and I'll drive you home. Drive me with my own car? I'm on your way and I saw a great movie I want to tell you about it I don't want your sting or your honey! - just one kiss. We are at work! Don't keep us waiting, we want to get rich! - I will make you stinking rich! Goodye poverty! - Good night you peasants! Don't do this to me! Hamdi! Hamdi! Hamdi! Help me, call the police, my money! They took my money! Call the police! OK, OK! Hamdi! - Call the police they stole my money. Hamdi! What's going on? Get away from the window! Call the police! What happened? Mr Hamdi, please call the police! Please Mr Hamdi. What happened? A guy attacked her, I saw him dragging her. Did he rape her? - No, he didn't get the chance. What did he look like? Tall and dark with fuzzy hair, a denim jacket and no shirt. OK, OK calm down I won't stay here! Take me home! - OK, I will .. No, no I want to go now! Please try to remember his face I told you I didn't get a chance I suddenly had a bag over my head! How could I see him? Did anyone see him? Did any of you see him? - No sir, no. So nobody saw his face? What can I do? I'm not psychic! Am I lying? He mugged and tried to rape me I'm the victim here! I empathise but, what can I report? Say that no one saw anything? It's your job to do something! OK relax I remember something. What? You saw him? - No. No but Mr Hamdi was at his window and saw everything. Why didn't you say so?? Find his address and go get him. - The woman in the window was shouting Hamdi. Her shouting scared him! - Mr Hamdi lives alone, there is no woman I'm sure I saw a woman, she must have seen him. Send a car and get whoever is there. - I also found this wallet where she lay. Is this yours, doctor? - Never seen it before. Naeema AbdRaboo, bring this woman in too. Hello bastard. - What is that? What are you doing back so soon? You look like a diplomat. Money! Where? The wheel will start to turn. Where did you get this money from? - A long story! An investment windfall so I'm opening the disco! Didn't I say honesty is the best policy? Money makes the world go round! Money makes the world go round! Mr Hamdi, witnesses saw you at your window at the time of the incident. Well? Did you see the incident or not? - Yes, of course I did. Was anyone with you? - Like who? A woman for instance? - A woman? I'm a single man I don't have women coming to my place I'm sure there was a woman at the window. You are wrong, doctor! You couldn't recognize your attacker, nevermind, someone at the window! You must be confused from the trauma. I got out shower with a towel on my head, it must have looked like a woman. That is impossible! I'm sure there was a woman at the window! Well, at least we now have a witness. How did he look like? What? Yes he was tall. - Yes and? And he was wearing a denim jacket. And it was open, right? I thought you saw him? Yes, I saw him. Lila? Saber? Lila, my God, what happened? Who did this to you? Lila, answer me, what happened to you? Tell me! I'm your mother, talk to me! Oh my God, please talk! I'm your mother. Saber, whats happened? - Leave her now, I know everything. How can I leave her? - Please mom, let her rest. Yes it's my ID and wallet that were stolen. When and where? - Yesterday's morning. A guy on a bike snatched my bag. He took everything. All my wages were in it. Remember what he looked like? I only saw his back but I read the bike's licence plate. Okay-what's the number? It was .. 52245 ..no it was 53245. How can identify him? I didn't see him in the first place. They have a suspect We must try.. Please can I see his back? - This one? - No the one before him. Could the last one move forward? Turn around, boy I also want to see his back again. What about his back? Turn around again boy. What did he look like? Tall and dark with curly hair. Now tell me is he one of them? Huh? What do you mean Huh? Concentrate. Is the man you saw, is he one of these? I don't know, I'm not sure. - Didn't you say you saw him? Yes but I'm really not sure. And you doctor? Also not sure? - I said I didn't see him. The witness is supposed to identify him, but my feeling is it's this one. And you Naeema? - Maybe him but I don't want to accuse. OK, let's go. Sorry, I wanted to help but wasn't sure I have one question and I want an honest answer. Yes doctor. - Who gave you his description? What do you mean? I saw him. - You are lying. Lila, take it easy. He didn't see anything and he wasn't at the window! Who was at the window? My ghost? - It was a woman-is she married? What are you talking about? - I'm very sure. If she wasn't shouting the guy wouldn't have taken off. You are seriously confused! You forgot this can happen to your daughter, sister or wife! Anyways, I've said all I wanted to. - Whatever! We are not done yet. Do you have a record boy? Answer me! - No sir, never been in trouble before. What's your job? A merchant, a street vendor sir. Where were you last night? - At the mosque for evening prayer. Then went home to eat and slept. Anyone see you? Do I need a witness to be at the mosque? Why did you do that?? I just don't like the your face! Our money will not go to waste. Our father died and the insurance won't pay. Calm down Lila please. - How can I be calm? It's like watching Dad die again! That money was our only hope! Are we was just dreaming? It can't end this way! Saber, where you going son? Saber! Mom, what's wrong? I'm OK Lila, I don't care for the money As long as you both are safe. Weed! - Welcome back Fayome! What kept you so long? - A boy followed me. Let's teach him a lesson. - Anything for you. No need! Just break every bone in his body. OK, come on, Lolo! Come here, pretty boy. - What are you doing? You are asking what, boy? Don't you know this is our territory? Don't come here again I don't want to see your face here again! Did you hear him? Welcome! What size is this? It won't fit me. Is this boy giving you problems? Come here, you think you are smart. In which room is Saber El Hilali? - Next room. Come Mom. Saber, my son who did this to you?? Where did you go? Who did this? Answer me! It was him right? The one I suspected? Its the only proof that it was him! Answer me! We are living in a jungle! How could this happen? No, no! - Lila! Doctor! - We still have things to discuss. Like what? - Who was the woman in the window? I don't know what you're talking about! - You know exactly what I'm talking about! Please lower your voice. So answer me! I have I already told the police everything. You are a liar! This is your last chance to tell the truth. Nothing will stop me from bringing him to justice! Why did I get myself in this mess? Mervat, please listen to me! You must find a way to help me! - Whats the problem? This lady doctor insists that you go to the police to identify her attacker. I don't know what to do! - Do you know what this means? How can you think I'd go to the police? - What else can I do? You can both go to hell! I don't want to see your face or hear your voice again! Sorry I know you are not well, but we need to do this now. Is this the man who beat you up? He doesn't know Enough has happened. Leave us alone. Answer me Saber is it yes or no? No Are you sure? It's not him. It was him, don't be afraid Saber I'm sure it was him. You are not a witness he must identify him. Speak up Saber please He did it all didn't he? Please doctor what you are doing is against the law! Isn't there a law against such people walking around? There's only one law that protects us, including someone like him! I forgive her this time since she's been through a lot I won't let you get away with it! I'll see you hanged like a dog! Please doctor Move along, boy. You look so angry! - Why is this happening to me? All because of that crazy bitch! To think they're called the fairer sex? There's nothing fair about them! Cops beat me up at the station too! - What matters is if you enjoyed it. Bitch won't let it go, but no one will believe her now anyway! And now what have you done? - Everything is great! See for yourself, Fayome! We cleaned the place and hired a contractor for renovation. In 3 or 4 months and this place will be something else! People will be coming and going. A venue for people who want to dance or take drugs. You'll see it will be great! What drugs? - The ones that make you sick! I'm sure he raped her - Don't say that, she would have reported it. She doesn't want the scandal. - There she is! Who cares? Whats this in the paper? Why didn't you tell me? The article is accurate or do you think something else? I don't understand. - It doesn't matter anyway, excuse me. Lila, Lila! Nothing better to do than follow me? - Many but you're at the top of the list. So, what do you want? - Her name and address! If I say no? - I will shout until people gather. You are crazy! - Yes crazy. You know what this money means to us?! - Let go, I know nothing! Really? You are his accomplice! - Get out the way! Dr. Kamal! - Hi. Come in. Is Dr Lila here? Yes, Lila, Lila come. - Yes Mom I'm coming. Doctor Kamal is here. - Long time no see. - I've been busy. Some tea or cold drink? Will you have dinner with us. No thanks but you are the best mother in law! I think it's too late for these words, Come in. Lila, first I'm sorry. - For revealing your true feelings? When we're at Uni, forget we're engaged and try shut me out. Thank you Dr Kamal. Please listen! If you hang up I will have to come over! Get over it-months have passed! We have to meet, things are out of hand! My life and your reputation are on the line. OK, OK That's him! - Yes it's him! And what to do now? - Follow him! What do you want? Mervat... Lila, wait! - She is the only witness. Not like this and not in his presence! What do you mean? - We need to find her name and address. And we must let Saber know. Saber? No, he's been through enough. She knows it wasn't me at the window and she can identify you. Yeah?, I don't give a shit! It's your problem! She insists on finding your name and address. If my name crops up we will both regret it! You also threatening me now? She is going to create a scandal! What can I do? Bribe her, threaten her, beat her, there's a lot that you can do! My final words, stay away from me, Hamdi! - Mervat, please listen. Try to understand! Come let's follow her! Hello Saber, how are you doing today? You look better. - Thanks to you doctor. Remember the exercises and see me next week, ok? Okay, I will let you go. Welcome to a life of luxury! - We will drive the best cars! I will keep the place in good order. I will run this place like clock-work but with one condition... I will be the manager, eh Weed”? I will be responsible for the “atmosphere”. Weed” is the king of “ atmosphere”. And the king of medicine! And me? Yes him? And Lolo? Lolo? A bulldozer who will destroy anyone who gets in our way. The truth, the light, the wisdom... The power is here! Search inside yourself Egypt is immortal. Saber! Saber! Saber! Saber! Saber! Please cover yourself. - You cover me. Who are you? A lost truth. Lost? And how will I find you? Search for me in the sun. But I will burn if I get too close. Burning for righteousness is mortality I can't stand its fire. The sun for a seeker is light and not fire. Wake up, what happened to you? Go to Mr Safoat to give you your money. Go ahead Miss. Yes? What do you want? - I need your help. What kind of help? - You now what I want from you. And you know it's impossible I know you're married and this is embarrassing but we can find a way to protect your reputation. The money was all we had My father's life-work. It's our future me, my brother and my mother, please. Sorry, but there's nothing I can do. Please don't treat this so lightly. - You're bothering me at my house-get out! I didn't expect you to be so rude What if I tell your husband? Come back again and I call the cops! Maybe you didn't see my name on the gate! I know my rights and you will testify whether you like it or not! I said "Get out!" So rude! I want to talk to Mr Shawkat please... I can't believe you did this! Do you know whose wife she is? She is the key witness and I want my money back! You can't make her testify! And there's no proof she was there! I won't stop til she testifies, I won't pay for her mistake; help me! I'm on your side and I understand your feeling. But please stay away from her before her husband finds out! People like them only care for their public image. There's also a restraining order. Don't go anywhere near her. What's so funny? It's like ordering a murder victim not to scream! Isn't it ironic? What are you doing Saber? Would this solve the problem? Saber, Lila's going down a dangerous road. Ms Mervat please, I'm Saber, Dr. Lila's brother. Damn it, stay away from me! What are you doing? Are you crazy? You want to cause a scandal? I will hit the breaks! Stop this! What do you want from me? - Please listen to me. Fine! Speak and then go! The guy Lila accuses... All I want to know is, is it him or not? Then I won't bother you again, I promise you. Where are you going? This is a crowded place. If someone sees us together we will have another problem. Come with me. - Are you crazy. Is it him or not? - Yes it's him, that's it? Now you and your sister stay away from me! Are you sure? - Yes I'm sure. What's up Weed Do you know who she is? I wish I've never known I don't understand. - She is big trouble. Someone you don't want to mess with. - Explain. Her name is Mervat, the wife of an important man. This is not important. Then what is important? We'll send her a departure Visa. - But how? We'll send someone to kill her. And then? We kill him! - And if we get caught? No way, this is too big for us. This is professional crime. Agree Lolo? - You are right. Yes, we need a professional. We've come a long way, I'm not throwing it away now. We can waste it with one mistake! Don't be angry, AboRokba I'm done with you. Don't forget! I'm still Fayomi AboRokba! Hello. Yes? Bastards, bastards! Lila, whats happened? - They're going to kill Saber! What? Where are you going? Go to the garden. - Yes. You? What do you want? My husband will be here soon I won't move an inch til he arrives! - You are crazy! I will give you what you want, but he can't find out! What more must my brother suffer? Oh, give me a break! - You didn't give me one! Very well, I will do what you want to end this. Wait for me to change. Hello, police? Mr Shawkat please? Why did you killed her? Why? Why did you kill her? - I didn't, you must believe me! Witnesses saw you come out with the robe still in your hands! I was scared and confused but, I swear I didn't kill her! Then who killed her? - I don't know! I got a call saying they'd kill my brother if he didn't stay away I was afraid so I went there to tell her she must tell the truth. She agreed and went upstairs to change. I heard her scream so I ran upstairs. Then I found her dead with the rope around her neck! Who did this to you? What's going on here? Call the police, she killed her! I didn't kill her! I didn't kill her! I swear I didn't kill her! I went to the shop and when I came back the maid was screaming. I ran up the stairs and found the lady on the bed was not moving. With my own two eyes I saw her holding the rope. She had used it to kill her. This is what I saw. I can't take no more going from one office to another. Do what you like but let me sleep and have some rest. We're holding the defendant until her trial for killing Mrs Mervat Badran. Take her away. Oh God! Another fucking addict. What's wrong with you? What have you taken? What you in for? - I came in a police car. She's inexperienced Are you from vice? I'm from Cairo. So are you playing the fool? - How did you end up here? I didn't kill her. Who? Who you didn't kill? Answer me, girl! Answer us, girl! Leave me, I want to sleep. You want to sleep? Move aside, girls. Lay her down. Make us laugh, AboRokba I want to but you failed me. - Oh come on! Read it and weep! Fayomi AboRokba is no amateur! I have a brain, a very big brain! Unbelievable! - What is it? The doctor's wife killed Mervat! I had nothing to do with it, yet I got two birds with one stone! Son of the devil, well played, AboRokba! This is more like it! No dumb girl will get in my way. You mean you killed her? Yes I killed her and I'll kill anyone who stands in my way! What did you say? She escaped. The guard says it was well planned, it's all in the report sir. And the pretty one doesn't want some? - Leave her alone. She is under my protection, do you understand? If it wasn't for her I would be in the cemetery now. Why is this? I was poisoned in jail if it wasn't for her no one would have helped me I owe her my life Atwa. - Then I owe her my life too. Yes. - What? Was everything fine? - Of course, I'm Atwa! Tell her the news I got everything on Fayomi AboRokba! Where is he? Stay away from that bastard I won't tell you where he is. Just tell us! A snake like him needs to die and I will help the doctor. Please tell me where is he. - Its a snakes lair and I'm afraid for you! After what he's done to me there's nothing I fear I have 50 boxes of whiskey smuggled in. Smuggled or home made? - I swear its imported I will buy, stay outside and take a drink I will join you. Yes Antar, can't you get rid of that boy yet? Would you like a glass of whiskey? Why not a whole bottle? Yes but not here, my lovely. - Then where? Where? In heaven. Let's go. - Let's go my lovely. And me? Don't I have a share? Come after you close the Disco. Nothing is better than honesty I'm so drunk and barely had a drop! Shame on you Fayomi, I told you I hate drunks. For you I will sober up. But only in the morning. Get sober and I will love you. Sober? How can I be? Why not? You only need water to sober up. I would dive into hell for you, my lovely. Is this is OK? Sober now? Sober as a judge, my pretty! You recognize me now Fayomi? Of course, my mermaid! You knew me once on a dark night. You stole 70,000 pounds and ran like a coward. The doctor! How stupid of me! A stupid asshole and now we will settle the score! Whatever you want doctor, just say it! My 70,000 pounds. Yes. I will give you interest too. Gaber! - Nobody can help you now! Shut up or I will kill you. It's me who will kill you. You are holding a gun? It's not like dissecting a rabbit. Take her inside Gaber. Nothing better than honesty. What the fuck is this? Leave him alone. What happened to you? You are playing Travolta now? Where's Fayomi AboRokba? Fayomi is having fun. Tell me where's Fayomi AboRokba? And after we tell you? You will come with me to the police! You want us to walk into the police station? What happened to that boy? Maybe he wants to die? Why are you working here? - It's just a job. But they stole our money and framed my sister. Weed, Lolo, no need for violence, but you you must come to the police. Then what pretty boy? - Justice will be done. You are dreaming, cockroach. My God the girls knocked him down! Tear him to pieces! My God, Lolo can't handle them! Attack him. What are you waiting for? Go get him! Who will pay for all this?! Nothing is better than honesty! Fayomi killed Mervat, all I did was give the address. It was him who stole your sister's money. Will you say this to the police? I will say it on air! But don't hurt me. Where's Fayomi AboRokba? - He is now fucki.. I mean. Who? Lolo?! Yes Lolo. There's nothing better than honesty. Where's the girl? - Tied at the tower. You left her alone? Go and watch her and send the men. You alone or your nanny is with you?` I'm alone. Are you stupid, boy?! I'm Saber El Helali. And what do you want Mr Helali? You come with me to the police. - Police! OK but Seka will pamper you first. You won't get out alive, neither will your sister. Saber! This boy is a magician-kill him! Kill him! Saber. This is enough Saber. What's wrong sir? Didn't I say I hate your face? You've come to your death, pretty boy. Your fate is on my hands, I'm the one who will kill you. You proved your innocence. - Finally you believe me? We can't do everything alone, we all must work together. Congratulations Can I go home now? Of course but come in tomorrow for some paper work. And my money? - Sure you will get it back. No! You can't go home. You are wanted for the army draft. - That makes me happy. Let me take Lila home and see my mother I will come first thing in the morning. Subtitles by wildhorse and shaunx (CG)
