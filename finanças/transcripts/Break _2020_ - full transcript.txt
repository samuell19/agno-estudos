Everyone in this life is born with at least one talent a gift, an ability to do a particular something better than anybody else. Sadly, most of us will never realize our true potential. Either we're too poor, we were born on the wrong side of the tracks, or maybe we're just unlucky. But the truth is the only thing holding us back is ourselves. Aye! Aye oi, you man! What? Don't run, don't run, don't run. All right, on your toes. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Where you going now, pussy hole? I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Come out now boy! Denis had come to UK from Russia just five years earlier. And although his murder was tragic, he was just another in a long line of stabbings that year. Another wasted talent. I'll never forget that day as long as I live, but for me life went on as usual. At least it did for a while but someone was about to change all that. Sweet Ginge. Alena, can I grab a drink please? Spencer. All right, Ray. How come your smell like a hash bar? I must have smoked one on the way down, probably still on the clothes. If I ever catch you smoking dope in here I'm going to have to break your fingers one by one. No more snooker, capiche? Yeah, all right, yeah. End of your piano playing as well. What's the bet? Yo big man, you want some crack, some pills? Excuse me. I got them quality pills bruv. Uh, no thanks, I'm good. Hello, can I help you? Hi, I'm a friend of Terry. Who? You want a wrap of charlie? - Charlie? - No, no, no, no. Hang on a sec. Fuck off! A week, right? Yeah, sweet as man. Good lad. You don't get many strangers in Ray's and I must confess the first time I laid eyes on Qiang I figured he was Old Bill. Who installed the water feature? Same bloke that nickname lead probably. So someone stole the lead, huh? Yeah, property mate. Name's Vince Qiang. Is it? Fancy a game? I'm trying to play a game now mate. What's the point in having talent if you keep it to yourself? Who said I've got talent? Oh, everyone has at least one but I wasn't talking about you. I was talking about me. No, you weren't. So what'd you say? By the way you wrote your cue I'd say pool's probably more your thing, innit? You're actually right but I think I can adapt. It's just a matter of colors, right? How do you like pink? Can you match it? Have to pot a ball every time you take a shot. It's not pot a ball, it's snooker. You just lost 50 kid. Ain't over yet, mate. Oh, it's over all right. Unlucky, Spencer. Oh hey, how'd you know my name? Okay, you got me there. I was sent for you. Here Chloe, I'll get that, hang on. All right girls, let me get it. What have you got in here, boulders? No, it's just my mom's shopping. Ah, where is your mum, in bed again? Yeah, she said she was tired. Did she, I bed she did. - Tired as a newt? - What's a newt? Don't talk, Sophie. Here, let me put this in there for you. - Thanks Spencer. - Ah, you're welcome. Have a nice evening girls. Another letter came for you today. Oh yeah? This came and all. Visiting orders. What does he want a visit for he's out in two weeks? Want me to read the letter? He's got a job. What is it, bank job? No soppy, a proper job. Might have some work for you. I don't want his work, mum. Well, I'm sorry, but I don't earn enough for both of us. Not the way you go through that fridge. So if you want to carry on sleeping under this roof you need to get a job. What's happening? Have you got a light by any chance? Light? Spence! You're too young to smoke, Lloyd. What's happening boys? Did you get it? Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. I'm good, let's go inside and carve it up, yeah. Amazing! Have you found him yet or what? No hang on, I'm just trying a different spelling. That's working, innit? Eh, no wonder you lost, look, check this geezer out. Is that the fellow who mugged you off, Spence? What do you mean, mugged me off? I lost, that's all. Man's some big pool champion as well, man. Yeah, all right. Hey, Spence, is that who I think it is? Go on. Yeah, that's him all right. Ugh, he's a big chappy. Just play your game, man. Spence, all right. Who's Vincent Qiang? What, that's it? Five years and you know, not hello dad how are you? He's a pool champion. Well, at least he was. Nowadays he's like coaching snooker, pool, anything. Yeah, I know that, I looked him up. Did you? I met him when I was working the doors. He was doing like an exhibition thing. What, so you sent him down to Ray's to mug me off? What are you talking about? No, I asked him to have a look at ya, see if he'd you know, consider coaching you. What do you mean he mugged you off? He wasn't doing that Chinese tourist act thing, was he? No, I lost, that's all. You lost? You know, you were hitting century breaks at the age of 13. Yeah, I was was stoned weren't I. What, don't approve? I'm not the one stuck in here, am I? Here, Gov. Passport to the big time world snooker Q school. School? It's a qualifying school. You can be a pro player. Who said I want to do that? Well, it's your dream, you've always wanted to be a snooker player. What do you know about my dreams? I hardly saw you before you was in here. You don't know me. No, I don't, I don't know you. I've made some mistakes, Spence. I mean, I was a kid myself when you were born. You do understand that. I don't know if your mom told you but when I get out, I've got a job. I'm thinking you and I can get to know each other. Yeah, she told me. Tell you what, you answer me three questions and I'll consider doing the job. On my 7th birthday, I was waiting at the estate for someone to come pick me up. Where was he? What about my 8th birthday? Or my 9th? Yeah, all right, all right. I wasn't there for your special occasions but I visited as much as I could, all right. I did take you to the pub on your 10th birthday. You remember that, we played pool. You remember? And then we went back to your mum's, we had some cake. Whoop de fucking dos. Do you know what? I will do the work 'cause I don't want to hear mum bitching and moaning. But let me tell you something, I do not want to know you, Terry. All right, cool yeah, nice one. George just been on the blower, he wants a Henry. You won't be so flash when you get chored, will ya? How am I being flash? Besides, you're the one out thieving all day, aren't ya? I get caught, I get a slap on the wrist. You're dealing class A boy, and for what? You could earn what Ginger gives you flicking burgers. Oh my dazes, are you hearing this Wallis? Clarky thinks we should be flipping burgers, bruv. Yeah, all right. Such a vandal, Wallis. Vandal, are you joking? I just doubled the price on the property, on his shit hole. That is quality mate, that is. That's bollocks, that's what it is. Yeah all right, behave. Spencer, up, you're already late! Mum, what are you doing? Spencer, get up! Mum, what are you doing, have you gone mad or something? No, but I will do if you don't get your arse out of that bed. Your dad's called, he's already been waiting half an hour! You getting out or what? What we doing here? We're working. Well, at least you are, I'm just a spectator. Take it you're not stoned this morning. Q. Hang on, what are you doing? I'm meant to be mixing cement and stacking bricks. Yeah, it's plenty of time for that. But today I'm paying you to play snooker. How's a hundred quid sounds to ya? No, I ain't your show pony, boss. All right, if you win, I'll give you a two'er. Here you are, mate. Terry, good to see you out of prison-issue joggers and sweat top on my friend. Not a good look. Oh really, I thought it quite suited me. Hey listen, talking about good looks you still got those glasses? I dug them out specially for you. Ah, Spencer! You very good! You ready to place snooker? Brilliant, brilliant, you know, some nights he made a small fortunate on that little act. Really? It's all set up. Would you like something to eat first? I can get Shelly to cook something. No, you're all right, let's get this over with. Okay, let's do it. 27. Sharp. - Well played. - Cheers. You owe me 200 quid. See you later. So, what do you reckon? He can certainly pot balls. His long game is outstanding. I'm sensing a but. Shelly, can you give us a moment please? This tournament thing. It's a big commitment. Wouldn't you rather spend quality time with him before... Before what? It's all right, you can say it, mate. I'm not scared of it. It's your choice. I think he deserves to know the truth. He'll hate you if you keep this thing from him. He hates me already. I don't want to guilt trip him into spending more time with me. What I do want is to stop him from fucking his life up. I get that. It's just, you don't have to face this on your own. Well, trust me mate, if I could give you a little bit of this then we can fight it together. That's not funny. Eh? Then what you smiling for then? Come on, you gonna help me out or what? Yeah, hold up, that's me. - All right, then. - Sweet Ginge. Now listen, don't be hanging about here with that all night, right? 'Cause it's got my prints all over it. So do what you gotta do, get rid of the packaging, okay? Yeah, of course, sweet. It's good, Ginge. Right, bolt. What's that? What do you mean? You gotta mix it, you gotta let it go round! Cover that up! - Spence, cover it up! - All right, sir! Youse the one who showed me how to do it, anyway. Shit! - Mrs. Taylor? - Yes? Detective Inspector Bligh. We have a warrant to search these premises. Morning, Wallis. How are you today? Oh dear, got yourself a floater. Heard what happened to your mate, Denis. That must have been hard on you. Hello, Spencer. Had a nice day? I have, I had a terrific day. Had the old Bill turn the house upside down. Yeah well, I don't keep nothing here, do I mum. They're not going to find anything. Oh, oh, so that's all right, isn't it? I've had two men rifling through my knicker drawer and you think that's all right? I don't need to hear this shit. Yes you do! I am sick of this, Spencer, I am sick of it! And I wouldn't bother going round to your little mates either, because he was carted off at seven o'clock this morning. Do you reckon he'll get bail? What, with his record? He's already got three no-shows, doesn't he? Your little reign of drug barons didn't last too long, did it? Payback Ginger for the gear? - No. - Whoa. Nice knowing you, Spence. Why don't you go into business with your old man? Your mom must have a pair of old stockings you can borrow. - Get on this whip. - Cool. Spencer, can we talk? I ain't got nothing to you say to you, bruv. Come on, get in. I've got a business proposition to put to you. Spence, what you doing? - I'll catch you lot at Ray's. - What? I'll chat to you later. That's a lovely motor. Let me guess, it's about that Q school thing, is it? No, unfortunately we missed the entry deadline for the Q school. There's another tournament that I'd like you to consider being held in my hometown. - Where's that? - Beijing. Beijing, nah, I can't go to Beijing. Sure you can. I'll sort out the entry forms, flights, accommodation expenses, everything. All you've got to do is say yes and show up. You expect me to play in this tournament just 'cause he wants me to, yeah? No, you're supposed to play because it's a pathway to a better life. What do you know about my life? Oh, that's a tough one. Let me see you spend most of your time hanging out with your buddies at the snooker hall or when you're not doing that you're most likely sitting on a wall somewhere drinking, smoking dope, probably dabble in petty crime or drugs, would be my guess. Oh, then there's the knife, gotta have a knife, right? How am I doing? I could drive to any major city, London, Liverpool, Manchester, you name it and I see you standing on every shitty back street corner I pass. You're not original, you're a fucking drone and one day you'll look back on your life and realize that you did nothing with it. Don't do that. What, like him you mean? What I can't tolerate in people is stupidity. If you really don't want to do this, that's fine. But if you refuse to do this, cause you're angry at your father then you're an idiot. Okay, get out. I ain't an idiot, you know. Prove it. Don't be like your old man. Do something with your life. What do I get if I win? You get to play on the pro tour. All right, what have I got to do? Be at my place tomorrow, 9 a.m.. Spencer. I'm not asking you to change who you are but you may want to change the way you see things. It's about perspective. You ain't going to win no tournament. I've won them before. Yeah, in this piss hole against shit players. You ain't that good. How'd you expect to pay for it anyway? You know, hotels, flights to China? He's paying for it, innit, if he thinks I'm that good. Yeah, a good sort. I mean, it's sort a bit cozy innit. Just the two of you fancy hotel, that four poster bed. Ain't two of us going though, I'm taking your mum as entertainment, aint' I? Oh, that's deep, bruv. You want to stop with the mum thing, I'm telling ya. You want to stop mugging me off. You're mugging yourself off. Keep talking shit. I'm so good. I'm gonna be a snooker champion. What's your problem, Clark? You're my problem. Your mum this, your mum that, bollocks! He don't like it, does he? It was you that's been giving it all day. Talk about my mum's stockings. Stockings! What's he talking about? Hey, you two, fuck's sake! You know what Clark, if you want to go let's just fucking go, eh? - Come on! - Aye! Stop it! You want to fight, go outside! You know what? You can fuck off Clark, 'cause you're just a wanker. Spence. Yeah, it weren't me who watched Denis get shanked, was it? How dare you talk about my brother! I'm... I'm sorry. We've got to stop meeting like this. You all right, Lloyd? Yeah Spence, I'm good, I'm good. Out a bit late, aren't ya? I was just on my way back from my gran's, actually yeah. I swear those things are supposed to unscrew, you know. Yeah, I have heard that. Must have lost the instructions, eh. No, you're all right bruv. Police got your mate, innit? Yeah man, they certainly did. They came looking down mine the other day. Was they looking for your brother? He had a gun, you know. All right, Spence. Sweet, Mike. All right, I better go, I'll catch you later. Later, Lloyd. Who's your mate? Who, that? That's dangerous Lloyd, bruv. He backs me as well, you know, you ought to be more careful. Give us a bang on that. Lil pussy. All right, where we going? Yeah, sweet man. You owe me a new cue, you know. You're late. Sorry, yeah, trains. Forgot your cue? Do you know what, it broke. Go home, Spencer, sleep it off. Come back tomorrow and we'll go through the rules. Listen, about what Clark said the other night. Don't worry about it. He was right though. I just sort of stood there and watched it happen. You were frightened, I don't blame you. If you want to do something, give me the name. I don't even got a name. Never seen him before or since. If I had a name, trust me he'd get done, innit. And then what? Go to prison all your life? Leave it to professionals. Do you know what kind of a man is Ray? Yeah, I heard stories about him growing up. Used to run most of south London when I was a kid. And he's like a father to me. So you give the name to Ray and the rest is history. A name. That's all. No smoking pot. In fact, no drugs, period. No drinking the night before a match. You need a clear head. Snooker is a gentleman's game, so no swearing. You will be respectful, win or lose. You will shake the hand of your opponent before and after the match. Anything you want to say? I didn't know I was allowed to talk. Talking is good. I've arranged a match for you a week on Saturday. Against who? Dao Leung, or Daggers. According to my sources, he is the next big thing. I told them you are the next big thing. Don't let me down. Don't worry, I won't. Good, let's get to work. Oh, I needed that. Do you want another tea? Get another tea please, love? Eat now and then we'll get back to work, all right. All right, Spencer. What's happening wee man? Nothing much, been out trying to get your dough, innit. Old Bill took all the cash and all the gear when they got Wal, so. Aye, I heard about that. And I'm willing to give you some more time but don't avoid me. I'm telling you don't avoid me. Nah. 'Cause it's five fucking grand Spencer. And I think you know I'm the type of man that's not gonna just wipe his mouth. How much do you got on you just now? I can give you like a oner innit. Spencer, I'll put a tan right down the side of your fucking jaw if I think that you're taking the piss. And right now I think you are. Give me all of it. - It's a week's wages. - I don't give a fuck! You owe me. Nah, I'm going to introduce you to my new partner, Weasel. He's going to be making collections for me from now on. Hmm, I do believe we've already met. You do recognize me, don't ya? What, you don't remember me nah? How about now? Yeah, it's all coming back to you now, innit boy? Pop, pop, shank, shank. Remember me now, didn't ya? just so you understand all right, this, this is just interest. You still owe five grand. The longer you take to get the more you pay, comprende? - Ginge, I can't... - Shut the fuck up man! I've already told you it's me you're dealing with now. Give me that. Weasel will come back next week. That's unless you give it to me before then. Don't be getting no funny ideas, all right. Best to leave things in the past or you might not have a future. You get what I'm saying? Take me about five minutes to find out where you live. You get me? You know the score, wee man. This is how it works so go on and get tae fuck. Come on. Pussy hole. You're playing well, Jack. We're done but look at your safety next time. Okay. Sorry Qiang, I didn't realize you were with someone. It's fine, we're done. Spencer, this is Jack. Yeah, I know who you are, Jack. Hi Spencer. I'm coaching Spencer for Beijing. Good luck out there, mate. Cheers, bruv. - See you soon. - See you later. Listen, look Qiang, I've come here, but I can't play today, mate. It's pointless, my head's not in it. You want to talk about it? Let's go and have a coffee. Shelly, two coffees, please. I understand. Thanks. Well, given everything you've just told me, I'm not surprised you're feeling anxious. Does your dad know any of this? He wouldn't be interested. Give him a chance, he's a good man. Yeah, that judge didn't think so, did he? Well, I've known your dad since 1993 at an exhibition I played. He worked the doors. He knew some bad people, but as far as I'm aware he drove the car and got caught first time. Yeah, well he was shit at being a dad and a villain then. He's trying Spencer, he's trying. You all right? You've hardly said a word all night. I'm just tired. Oh, I've nearly forgotten, a mate of your knocked here today. What was his name? Weasel? Weasel? Weasel knocked here? What did he want? Just asked if you were in and said to tell you that he'd call by. Why, who was he? I never heard you mention his name before. He's no one. It's all good. Nice shot. Did you just take a picture of my bum? Nah, I'm joking, course I didn't, look. Vincent had to go somewhere. So he asked if I could play a few frames till he gets back. Oh yeah? Do you know how? Set em up and then we'll find out. Want to make this a bit more interesting? Hm, no I don't gamble with my money. What about a fun bit then, like a forfeit. If I win, you got to spend the night with me. Well, I'll give you a headstart. 50 'cause you're a girl. A lewd proposition followed by a sexist comment. What a gentlemen. No, I meant like dinner or drinks or something. I know exactly what you meant. You're on. You can break. All right, I'll make this one easier for you. Am I doing it right? Yeah, looks all right to me. I've underestimated you, ain't I? What, with a 50 head start? I think the writing's on the wall. What do you mean? What, you done all this? What have I let myself in for? What have you let yourself in for? Yeah, what have I let myself in for? Well, if I win, you have to spend the night with me and I don't mean drinks and dinner. I ain't wearing that. Yes you are, you lost. Now put them on. That seriously all you got? Woohoo! Strike! Calm down, what you doing? I'm having fun, what are you doing? You need to stop taking yourself so seriously. I had a really good time tonight. - Really? - Yeah. Vincent Qiang, my old friend, how are you? Monty, Spencer Pryde. How you doing son, pleased to meet ya. All right, so this is the boy, is it? Is he a good, can he play? He's a natural. A bit rough around the edges, maybe, but like a diamond just needs polishing. Yeah, and you're just the man to do it and all. Qiang, the diamond merchant. I like it, I like it. Oh, this is Dao Leung. Where'd you find him? Well, I found him in Chinatown hustling the tables for a few quid. Got him a coach, put him into some locals. He wiped the floor with some very good opponents. Didn't you, son? Dao Leung. All right, all right, English, English. I don't want you poaching my players, you old pirate. Relax, we're just talking about Beijing. Yeah, actually we're going too, so we'll see you there. Oh, I wanted a word with you about that. All right, Spencer? Yeah, you all right, uh... Daggers, call me Daggers. - Call. - Heads. All right fellas, it's best of nine. Daggers, you break first. All right fellas, I want a good clean fight. No holding, no kissing, and definitely no stroking each other's cue. Come on Flick, get on with it! Monty, you're barred. What do you say, hey Vincent? Let's keep it friendly. 500 sounds good. Take your time. Save the impossible shots for the practice table. I never knew you to play it safe. Let the boy miss if he wants to. He's missed enough already. Sorry, bad joke. One nil to Daggers. Well done my son, well played. Four more. Four more frames of pain for you, Vincent. Is he playing left-handed? He's taking the piss, ain't he? Don't concern yourself with what he's doing. Do what you've got to do. Score stands at Daggers three, Pryde two. There will now be a brief interval as the ref is busting his balls for a piss and needs a cigarette. Got a light on you, fella? Sweet, cheers, mate. It's all right, bruv. Daggers wins the frame and the match, five frames to two. Yes, well done Daggers! Good match, Spencer. Hope to see you in Beijing. Yeah, whatever, mate. Oh, looks like you got yourself a bit of a bad loser there, eh Vincent? I think he's just a bit annoyed at himself. I don't know what happened to him. Different player after the break. I'm not surprised. I'm amazed he could stand up. What are you talking about? Caught him out front smoking a big reefer. Not sure if it's that nutty skunk, but it didn't half smell strong. Ah, what a shame, aye? Decent player and all. Come on, I'll buy you a drink. Why the hell would you do that? I was trying to calm my nerves. I thought I was having a panic attack, all right. Bullshit. Do I look like a fucking idiot to you? You know what I think? You're so scared of failing that you fuck up on purpose so you have an excuse. Sorry. Sorry? I'm sorry, Spencer because there is no way I'm investing my time and money in you. You're a bad risk. Unless you can finance this thing yourself, forget it. What you gonna do then? What can I do? I can't come up with the money by Friday. He knows that an all, couldn't wait to drop me. Fuck him, anyway, larging it up in his shitty little club, treating me like some sort of joey. You need to start taking responsibility for your actions. Fuck that's supposed to mean? Wasn't him that smoked drugs in the middle of a game, was it? Oh, might have known you've taken his side. His side? Do you know what, I'm done. I can't sit here and listen to you blame everyone but yourself for your fucked up life. It's frustrating, you're frustrating. Well, fuck off then. I don't need you anyway. Driving about in your flashy little motor, silver spoon hanging out the side of your mouth. You think you're better than me? Oh really? I've worked hard for every fucking penny I've got. Maybe you should try it instead of running around with your muggy little mates. And I don't think I'm better than you. I think you're better than you. Raise. Here's your drink, Ray. Down to you, Ginger me old son. Fuck it, fold. Yeah, I'm out. Check. John, you can't. I just raised it. You raised it? I didn't hear you raise it. Did he raise? No need to ask him, he folded. Just you know, don't be afraid. Just play. I'm thinking. You're thinking. If you're thinking you're fucking yourself. I'm considering my options. Folded. Good man. Look at all that dough, Spence. Do you right now, wouldn't it? Shut up, Mike, I ain't in the mood. I mean, I ain't being funny but what are you gonna do with your life? For the past few weeks you've become an unemployed drug dealer, become a washed up snooker player, oh and now your bird's dumped ya. I ain't a washed up anything, Clark. I'm still playing in that tournament. With what, you ain't got no money. I've got money, bruv. Yeah, if you got money, you should pay Ginger. Shut up you idiot. If you do business with someone, you should pay up. You just said you got money, so what's the problem? Pay up, Spence. Ginge. Ginger. You little fucking prick. You and your little muggy mates are taking the piss outta me? We wasn't taking the... You think it's a fucking joke? Give me your fucking hand! Give me your hand. I am gonna smash your fucking hands to bits. Gentlemen, I hate to bother you, but we're playing a card game. What are you playing, Tom and fucking Jerry? Sorry, what's your point? I got a winning hand, that's my point. Now here's what needs to happen? You go back in there, sit down, take your cards and apologize for being a dickhead. Then you'll throw your hand on the table you raise your voice when you say, "I fold". Fold? Why would I fold? That's how I win. You're doing me a favor, right? I want a grand from you next week, or I'll break both your arms, you wee fanny. You know, Alena doesn't always get it right but she thinks you're a good kid. Clean up your bloody mess before you leave. You could move in here. There's a spare room. No, I don't think he would like that much. I'm happy where I am, Kath, I's fine. You know what? I was thinking, if you do you want to do something for me you could always, erm... Do one for the road. - Really? - Yeah. Well, we'll have to see what we can do about that. - Your dad's here. - Don't want to speak to him. He only came around to give you this. It's for your trip to China and the tournament. Terry. Thank you. For the money I know I don't deserve it, so... Oh don't say that. Look, we all make mistakes in life. I've made more than most. So just consider it as an early birthday present, or you know, a late one for the ones I missed, all right. I'll let you down, I will, I'll let you down. Well then we'll be quits, won't we. Look, I'll call Qiang in the morning, all right, I'll tell him that you got the money. Don't think he'll want anything to do with me, Dad. Don't worry about it, I'll speak to him. Listen, why don't you give that stuff a miss, you know, the waccy baccy. It's not good for your game, is it? It's not good for you. Where your van? I sold it. You know, maybe when you're a rich and famous snooker player maybe you can buy me a new one. Maybe. Hey, well I worked for a Rolls Royce. Don't push it. I'll see ya. See ya, mate. That's a lovely phone, that. Let me use it, my battery's gone. No, it's mine. I didn't ask whose phone it was. Give me the phone you little prick. Pussy. So what does your brief reckon? A year, 18 months maybe. Oh, we messed up big time, didn't we? Should've flipped them burgers, bruv. Seriously though, when I get out I'm going to start using this. Yeah, that won't get you very far, will it? Fuck off. That's it. Listen, thanks for coming though, yeah. Of course, cheers. Contact, Taylor. Yeah, all right Yatey, you can calm down. Yeah, yeah, less of the lip, son. Surprise! Oh happy birthday baby, look who's here. Sorry, I didn't know it was your birthday. I just came to give you this. You left it in my car. Cool. This one's from Nanny. All right. Ah, that's nice innit, bless her, she ain't got much money. Yeah, I'll phone her later. That's from me. Oh, thanks mum. You're welcome, baby. I'm sorry about the other day. I was out of order. No, you was right. Qiang was right. I'm scared of failing. He's very insightful. My foster mom used to call him the wise old owl. Foster mom, I thought you was... Yeah, I know silver spoon. In and out of care most of my life. If you're lucky, you might get to see my cigarette burns one day. If you ever want to talk, do you know what I mean. I don't need a shrink, Spence. You might, though. Yeah, maybe. There's nothing wrong with failing Spencer. As long as you don't give up without a fight. Yeah, well it's out of my hands now, innit. I owe a bloke a lot of money and if I don't give him a grand by day, he'll probably break my arms, so. Happy birthday, Spencer boy! Look, I've got you, well I've got you a present. Thanks. It's a good one. Yeah, I know, I can feel it, it's good. O'Sullivan uses uses the same one, apparently. Did you fill out your entry form? Yeah, it's just there on the side. Yeah. Yeah, 'cause I'm going over to Qiang's now. I was thinking if you want, I can drop it over to him. You still got the money? Yeah. Yeah, it's there in the bag. Good boy. Okay, so Dagger's sponsor, Monty is it? He reckons he's gonna walk the tournament and I'm thinking well, you're going to give him a run for his money. Well look, cheer up. This is your passport's a big time, isn't it, remember. Yeah, I must have forgot, eh. Well look, I've got to go, I'll see you later, but happy birthday, yeah. I'll show you out. Thanks again Ter for the cue. It's appreciated. Doubt, he'd still be using a two piece, eh. Sure this is a good idea? It's like you said, I've got to take responsibility for my actions now. Mind you, I'd keep the engine running. If he says no, I'll probably be out of there quicker than Usain Bolt. You got my fucking money? Man asked you a fucking question! I need more time. Spencer, you've had enough fucking time. Take it easy. All due respect Ray, this is none of your business. Don't you use that tone of voice on me. All right, I hear you and and I apologize. It's a big man's club. Outside. Nah, I just need 10 more days. Too late, outside now! Oi! Let him go. Listen, this ain't got nothing to do with you old man, all right, just play your game innit. Would you like me to put manners on the prick? Why don't we play another game, like a Russian roulette. Listen, I'm sorry all right, it won't happen again. You're still alive lucky man, piss off. You, come here. I remember when you walk in here at first. You were a snotty little kid. You loved snooker. You had talent and then I watched you grow and you didn't do anything about it. It's a shame. How much does he owe you? Five, five grand Ray. I'll take care of it. What? You'll have your money tomorrow. And you owe me five grand plus 10% and I'll give you 11 days to pay me back. Now, get the fuck out of here. What the fuck have I just done? I think they call it jumping out the frying pan into the fire. Sorry, bad joke. Come on, let's go. Leaps and bounds, I'm telling you. Nice, nice. Hello Spencer, how are you doing? You don't look so well. Actually, I feel like shit but thanks for your concern. Recognize him, do ya? He's helping Dao refine his game. So what can I do for ya? Yeah, well I hear you feel pretty confident about the tournament. Well, you heard wrong. I'm supremely confident. How's he doing coach? Yeah, he's doing well. Thing is, I'm feeling pretty confident too. Good, I'm glad to hear it. Yeah, in fact when we played I was having an off day. Yeah, skunk would do that to you. What's that, pal? I broke my hand a while back. The plaster came off the day before we played and I still beat you left-handed. So don't come in here with your fucking excuses. How bout we take my excuses outside, how bout that? Concentrate! Get to the point Spencer, what do you want? I want a wager. Me versus him. I don't mean to insult you, Spencer, but I'll give you odds three to one against you beating Dao any day of the week. You are a waster. Go on then, put your money where your mouth is. I know you, Shelly right? You won the under 21's a few years ago. Yeah, I think a beat one of your girls in the final. Well, let me give you a bit of advice. You got more chance of beating him than this dope head, here. What's wrong, are you scared? This game, I assume we're talking about the tournament. All right then, how much? Five grand. Five grant, got five grand, have you? Yeah, I've got it but I won't need it. Well, I'll need to see it. You see, if I'm going to give you odds of three to one, I'm going to need a little bit of insurance. I'll tell you what, you show me the money and you're on. I didn't think so. It's parked outside. Is that your motor, is it sweetheart? Yeah, it's mine. It's worth more than five grand. Dao, how do you fancy a new motor? What color is it? Red. That's my lucky color. All right then, you're on. And may the best man win. That's it then. That's it then. No one's ever done anything like that for me before. You won't regret it. This car is my pride and joy. I regretted it the moment I said it. Thanks, yeah. Go on. Have you got everything? Yeah. Bye, mum. Come here then, give us a cuddle. Good luck. All right mum, you're breaking my ribs. Give us a call when you get there, all right. Don't get in any trouble, Spence. Mum, I'm going to a snooker hall in China. I'll be fine. I love you, yeah. See you in a couple of days. You all right Lloyd? What's happening mate? Spencer, we've go to go mate, come on. Give me that. Amazing, innit. Yeah. Do you want go out somewhere, have a little wonder around? Yeah. Cheers. Cheers. Here's to winning, eh. Just four matches stand between you and the pro tour. They've made Daggers the favorite so you could meet in the final. No problems, eh? No problem for me. Spencer Pryde. Okay, we're up, eh. Remember, take your time, play it safe, okay. Hi, that last guy was well good. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go on, son. You okay? And the winner is Dao Leung. Well done mate, well done. The final, eh. Oh yeah. It's amazing, innit. You'll be a while, then. We'll probably go out and grab a bite to eat. Yeah, see you then. Yeah, yeah, you too, bye love, bye. - Good? - Yeah, I'm good. Just landed. Ah, nice one. Anyone fancy going out? Yeah, we could do, I mean, the food here looks pretty decent. Fancy going back to that what was it? Houhai Bar street, I like it there. Have a wander about. Look, if you wanna, but let's not go too far, eh. Actually, you know if it's all right with you two I'd rather stay. The food here is excellent. I'm just zonked. Oh, I see. We've been stuck with the old fart Ter. Guilty. The lobster is excellent. You did well today. How'd you feel about tomorrow, confident? Yeah, I feel good. I'd feel better if you can dish out red cards in this game. Love to send that Monty off. Did you see him? All the sarcastic clapping, the little snarky face. No, it's just mind games. I wouldn't let it get to ya. Look, I'm just going to go to toilet, all right. I'll be back in a minute. I reckon he thinks he's special just cause he's worth a few quid. Monty? He doesn't care about money. He gives most of it to charity. It's all fun and games to him. He's involving you Spencer, that's all. You don't think I can win, do ya? It doesn't matter what I think, it's what you think that's important. Excuse me. Everything okay? Yeah, it's fine, it's just a bit of blood, that's all. It's a bit more than usual but that's to be expected. Do you want to go into the hospital? No, what they gonna do? Aye, come on, let's go back out there. Maybe it's time you tell Spencer. No, all right no. We're getting on, I don't want any drama, I'm happy. Come on. How was I supposed to know it was all in Chinese, wasn't it. Right, should we have another drink? Yeah, I'll get one. No, I think we should turn in now. He's got a final tomorrow. See, you're right Spence, you are an old fart. Look, you go beddy byes but I am going to have a drink with my boy. No, I said no. Come on Qiang, you can have one more. No, I can't and neither should you. Terry, come on, we're leaving. Terry! Ter, Ter, what's up with ya? Terry. Dad, Dad, Dad, get an ambulance! Dad, what's wrong? I'm all right. What's wrong with him? Shh, it's all right, it's all right. Did you know? Six or seven months ago he had a pain in his left breast, chest. He put it down to stress, but then he found a lump which he ignored, but it got bigger so he alerted the prison doctors but by then it was too late. It had spread to his lungs. Why can't we do chemo? It's aggressive. Chemo could have bought him some time but all he wanted was enough to help you. Stop you fucking your life up. Yeah, my life's already fucked. I don't think so. He's the reason you're here, not sitting on some wall stoned. The rest is up to you. The rest? You can't expect me to play Qiang, with him lying there. I understand shit happens, Spencer. Life is a continuous stream of events, incidents and experiences. But what matters is how you deal with it. You want to throw the towel in, that's fine, but know this, Terry, he'd want you to play the final, eh. This is it, this is it innit? - How is he? - I'm so sorry. Where's Spence? He took off about an hour ago. Five years and not hello dad, how are ya? It was your dream, you always wanted to be a snooker player. What do you know about my dreams? You don't know me. Look, we all make mistakes in life. I've made more than most. I do not want to know you, Terry. How many have you had? None. Hello baby. You all right? I still remember the day he went to court. He come round, he was wearing a suit. Said he was going for a job interview, didn't he? Asked him if it was a good job. - He said... - Not particularly boy. I really hope I don't get it. I remember. He did get it though, didn't he? Six years. Funny fucker wasn't he. He certainly could be. I wanted to know him a bit longer, mum. I know baby, I know, it's okay. I'm better. Qiang, I ain't going to pay that safety play, it bores me. Play how you want, just win. Thank you, for helping me with, I know you didn't want to. Whatever happens, I'm glad I did. All right. - You all right, Shell? - Yeah. You ain't got to worry about me you know, I'm all right. I'm not worried, Spence. Look, I'm gonna go get a couple hours kip, playing soon, innit so. Pryde, you break first. Settle down please, ladies and gentlemen. One. 45. Scores 51. Concede, concede. Spencer Pryde concedes. Leung leads one frame to nil. Spencer! Just give me a minute. Spencer, we should call this off, you can't continue. I can and I am. Son, I'm sorry about your dad, I truly am, all bets are off, okay. All bets are not off, Monty. But you're in no fit state. What bets, Monty, what are you talking about? With the greatest respect son, it ain't your decision to make. Bet stands. All right, but just to make it perfectly clear, if he loses, I will take the car. As long as you pay up when he wins. Come on. You all right, Spencer? Good lad, go on. Yes! You just cost me 15 grand. But it was worth it. Well done son, well done. I suppose you want the money in cash? I wouldn't mind Monty, I wouldn't mind. Well played, Spencer. Cheers, nice one. A wise owl once told me that I was unoriginal. He said that there was one of me on the corner of every street, in every city, all over the world. He told me to our lives are just a series of incidents or events and experiences. But the important thing is not the events themselves but how we deal with them. Some of us react in a positive way. It makes us stronger, more determined. Some, some let their experiences get the better of them. It consumes them, until eventually it becomes them, and ultimately it destroys them. There've been numerous events, incidents and experiences in my life so far. Some I wish I could forget. And some I hope I've learned from. You didn't let me down. Appreciate it. Well, you didn't give me too much choice, Ray. Alena you have something else for me? She said to just give that to you. It's the name she wanted. Yeah. Let's walk, walk with me. Take this with you, you earned it. Thanks, Ray. I don't need to see here again. Now, get the fuck outta here. But there is one event, one memory, I hope will stay with me for the rest of my life. Do you want another one? No I don't you jammy bastard. What's that, three in a row? I can't believe it Tel, I honestly don't know how you do it, you're crap. Well, I'll let you in on a little secret. You're crapper than I am. That's not even a word Tel, get a dictionary, mate. What do you mean, it's not a word? Get another drink will ya. Can I have a go now dad, please? Yeah, come on, let's have a go, let's do it. Get a little stick over there. So you got to put your hand on the table. Put your hand down like that, spread the fingers out. Bring the thumb in close. That's it. Well, you gonna hit that ball and get that one in. Go on, hit it. Yes! Yes, yes! And rolling back the years to reach the final please give a warm welcome to the one, the only, Darling of Dublin, crafty Ken Doherty. Good luck, Spencer. You're gonna need it. His opponent today has shocked and amazed us all with his meteoric rise onto the world stage, playing some of the most exciting snooker we've seen at this year's world championship. Please welcome the young man they're simply calling the Pryde of London, ladies and gentlemen, it's Spencer Pryde.
