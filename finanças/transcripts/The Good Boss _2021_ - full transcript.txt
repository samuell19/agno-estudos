Here we go! ﻿Pigs! ﻿Go, go, go! ﻿Get out of here! ﻿-Pig! -Garbage! ﻿Scum! ﻿Hit him harder! ﻿Go fucking home! ﻿Code 10-31, repeat, code 10-31. ﻿Unit 403 on the way. ﻿Contact dispatch. ﻿403 to dispatch, visual contact with the individual. ﻿He's running his ass off. We've got him! ﻿Stop! ﻿Freeze! ﻿THE GOOD BOSS ﻿BLANCO SCALES ﻿We have a lot to celebrate. ﻿Thanks to everyone we've grown this year. ﻿Thanks to Marketing, ﻿the people from R&D, but without the ability ﻿of the production line ﻿to meet commitments, we wouldn't be where we are: ﻿Miralles! ﻿Thank you, ﻿really, thank you. For being there, ﻿at the helm. ﻿We have to celebrate, but without getting care-less, ﻿because thanks to you ﻿today we're finalists for the award given by the regional government ﻿for business excellence. ﻿"Excellence." ﻿Don't you like the sound of that word? ﻿There are three candidates. Three. ﻿And Blanco Scales is one of them. ﻿So in the next few days we'll be getting a visit from the award committee. ﻿They can show up at any time, ﻿so we have to be alert. ﻿They'll ask you questions ﻿"Hey, what's it like to work at Blanco Scales?" ﻿And you tell them the truth: "It's wonderful." ﻿And Mr. Blanco ﻿is like a father to us, we adore him. ﻿Well, you all know my wife and I don't have children, ﻿and we don't need any ﻿because you're our children. ﻿If you're okay, then I'm okay. ﻿-Not in front of the kids! -Bullshit! ﻿And just like ﻿with children, well.. ﻿sometimes you have favorites. ﻿Or there might be another one ﻿who asks for less, but needs more. ﻿You're going to tell me what to do! ﻿And sometimes you have to make ﻿difficult decisions, for the good of the family, right? ﻿Dad! ﻿Dad! ﻿Say it again, let them hear you. -Sit down. -José, whar are you doing? ﻿Tell them, if you have the balls. Tell them I'm fired. ﻿Listen to this gentleman, he has something to tell you. ﻿-José, get your kids out of here. -Let them hear it, Rubio. ﻿I want you to tell them. ﻿If you're going to fire me, tell me in front of them. José, they can't be here. ﻿Yes, they can. If they can be left out on the fucking street, ﻿-they can be here. -José... ﻿With the shitty severance pay you're giving me! ﻿I understand, really. ﻿I have two homes to maintain! You know that! ﻿I'll have to leave mine, damn it. ﻿And I'll lose them. ﻿I'll lose them. ﻿-Take them away and we'll talk. -So I want you to tell them. ﻿So when they ask me why they can't go to swimming, I'll tell them: ﻿Remember that son of a bitch in a tie who was so nice ﻿and was so worried about you? Well, it's his fault you can't go. ﻿It's his fault you can't do anything! ﻿Goodbyes... ﻿Goodbyes are really tough. Nobody likes having to go. ﻿In this company, they hurt even more, ﻿because the relationships we create here go far beyond ﻿what it says in the contracts. ﻿Those of you who knew my father ﻿know that he was a just man, that's why he made scales. ﻿He'd say: "We care about balance, equity." I'm seeing him. ﻿"A society that makes more scales is a society with more justice." ﻿And how right he was. ﻿Your father started with him, right, Miralles? ﻿They were brothers. ﻿Well, I inherited his passion for work, ﻿his passion for scales and his passion for loyalty. ﻿Because loyalty is very important in this company, as you know. ﻿Very important. ﻿But saying goodbye is also important because ﻿it's part of life's process. ﻿And today is the end ﻿of an important cycle for some of you. ﻿And we're here to say goodbye ﻿to those who are emancipating, ﻿to move on to other places, other challenges. ﻿They stop being worms ﻿and become butterflies. ﻿Okay. ﻿Please, don't get me wrong, I mean that warmly. ﻿Here we gave you plenty of love. ﻿We taught you everything we know at Blanco Scales, which is a lot. We held nothing back. ﻿And, now, Inés, please. ﻿Thank you. ﻿Now we want... ﻿to give you a little something. So that wherever you fly away to... ﻿you'll always keep us close to your hearts. Victoria, come here. ﻿Let's see if I can ﻿do this without pricking you. ﻿There. ﻿Calm down. ﻿Stay calm, Vicky. ﻿I love you. We form very strong bonds at this company. ﻿I got emotional! ﻿SUNDAY ﻿BLANCO SCALES, ONE BIG FAMILY ﻿What are you thinking about? ﻿Nothing. ﻿It's impossible to think about nothing. ﻿What is he doing? ﻿He's fixing the water filter. ﻿On a Sunday? ﻿There was something I needed to tell you... ﻿It was important. ﻿But I can't remember. ﻿Then it must not be so important. Ma'am. ﻿Does it work now? ﻿I couldn't check the boiler, I haven't had time, boss. ﻿Thanks, don't worry about it. Go home. ﻿Boss, you always say that our problems ﻿are your problems, that if something affects us... ﻿It affects me too, yes. ﻿What's wrong? ﻿My kid got into a fight and spent ﻿all night at the police station. ﻿The one in the park mentioned in the paper? ﻿It wasn't them. ﻿The Arabs provoked them, the paper doesn't say that part. ﻿Oh, God. ﻿He's a good kid, you've known him since he was a boy. ﻿You came to his baptism, remember? ﻿It's that group of friends he hangs around with. ﻿I don't know. ﻿What was the delegate's last name? ﻿His wife goes to the shop. ﻿-De la Encina? -De la Encina. ﻿COURTHOUSE ﻿You talk to him, boss. He respects you. ﻿Deal? ﻿We made a pact as gentlemen. ﻿It's a secret, you can't tell anyone. ﻿Have him stop by my wife's shop on Monday. ﻿We owe you one, boss. ﻿MONDAY ﻿Boss! ﻿What's that? ﻿It's local. A reed warbler. ﻿Its nest must be nearby. ﻿It's been coming around the last few days. ﻿I give it a little syrup sometimes... ﻿It must be off kilter. ﻿Have someone fix it, please. ﻿It can't be like that. ﻿Good morning, everyone. ﻿Please, stop calling. You're jamming my phone. ﻿-Good morning, Inés. -It's José. ﻿He's called ten times this morning. José, which José. ﻿The guy who brought his kids. He's out of control. ﻿What do I tell him? ﻿Tell him to calm down, I'll call him back. ﻿-He wants to talk to Blanco. -And I want to talk to the Pope. ﻿How ugly. ﻿What an ugly thing to do to your kids. ﻿He's harmless, I'll handle it. ﻿Where was he? ﻿Accounts. ﻿Don't let him take anything. ﻿There's no danger. ﻿We have worse problems. ﻿Miralles? Again? ﻿-He screwed up again. -Damn it. ﻿And is it serious? ﻿He ordered the wrong processors. ﻿We'll miss the deadline. ﻿Who are they? ﻿The new interns. ﻿Those over there are precision scales. ﻿The... ﻿-Where is the tall one? -In Marketing. She has good references. ﻿Of course we'll solve it, let's just calm down. ﻿What do I do with the processors now? ﻿Send them back? ﻿I can't assemble them, I have ten men standing around here. ﻿-What's the problem? -We're missing the deadlines. ﻿There are... inaccuracies. ﻿We make scales, we can't afford ﻿inaccuracies. When is that shipment due? ﻿It needs to be in the warehouse on Friday. ﻿-Friday? -They can't do shifts? ﻿My people don't like.doing shifts. They're not your people, they're my people. ﻿Or do you pay them? ﻿We won't make it. ﻿We will, I'm telling you. We work ﻿Thursday night, leave early Friday morning, ﻿there by lunchtime. ﻿We'd have to put it on a plane. ﻿It will cost more than we make. ﻿Do the numbers, if they don't work, tell Sales to let them know. ﻿-Miralles, do me a favor... -Sorry. ﻿It's important. ﻿Hey, can you hear me? Listen, we need to talk. ﻿I'm not checking up on you. ﻿He sent a truck this morning to a fair in Frankfurt ﻿with the wrong shipment. Electronics ﻿won't even talk to him. It's like this every day. ﻿-Where are you going, dumbshit? -There he is. ﻿What are you doing? ﻿Watch where you're going, damn it! ﻿Book me a table for two tonight. ﻿El Rancho? ﻿At El Rancho, yes. ﻿Can you see right through me or what? ﻿Salva! ﻿Hi, sweetheart. ﻿I won't be home for dinner. I'm having problems with Miralles ﻿and I need to talk to him. ﻿Do you know him? ﻿He's Fortuna's kid. ﻿I promised his dad I'd help him out ﻿and I thought that maybe ﻿you can give him deliveries, ﻿-errands... -I don't do deliveries. ﻿Just keep him busy and out of trouble. ﻿Can't you keep it at the factory? ﻿Yes... ﻿I will, after the committee visit. ﻿Not smart. ﻿Mr. Blanco, welcome. How are you? ﻿Fine. ﻿-Your boy? -Great. ﻿Good. ﻿-Hey, what's up? -How are you? ﻿Hello. ﻿-How is everything? -Better, better. All fixed. ﻿What's fixed? ﻿The delivery today. ﻿I screwed up, ﻿but it's fixed. ﻿The new shipment is on its way, they meet halfway, ﻿switch the shipments, no big deal. ﻿Miralles... ﻿Miralles, how long have we been together ﻿making scales. 20? ﻿22 years. ﻿To me you're not an employee, that's the first ten years. ﻿After ten years ﻿you become something else, a friend, a brother... ﻿I don't give a shit ﻿about the shipment. ﻿That can happen to anyone. ﻿What I care about is you. ﻿You say you're fine and you don't look fine, ﻿Miralles, you look... ﻿You look bad, you look sad... ﻿Like your mind is elsewhere. What's wrong? ﻿I'm fine. ﻿There's nothing wrong. ﻿Don't treat me like a boss. ﻿If you treat me like a boss, I'll treat you like an employee. ﻿Are we at the factory? ﻿It's nothing, really. ﻿Remember that time... ﻿Yeah, when our dads went hunting together. ﻿They used to hunt together, remember that? ﻿They hunted down a cousin of his. ﻿And we went with them, we were like ten years old. ﻿And on the way back they left us ﻿in the car and went for a drink, remember? ﻿And we got into a lot of trouble because I grabbed the rifle... ﻿and it went off and I almost hit ﻿the dog. ﻿Thank God I have bad aim. ﻿-Do you remember? -I remember. ﻿Who saved my ass that day? ﻿Tell me, who? Who? -I did. -You. ﻿You took the blame to save me. ﻿And your dad gave you a good beating, that you remember. ﻿Well, this is the same thing, ﻿but I'm the one who wants to help you. ﻿So tell me what's wrong ﻿and we'll find a solution. ﻿My wife. ﻿Your wife. Did you have a fight? ﻿Yes. And also.. ﻿Well... ﻿Also? ﻿She wants to leave. ﻿Aurora? Where? ﻿I don't know where, she wants to leave in general. ﻿Leave and not come back. ﻿-Dump me like a piece of shit. -What are you saying? ﻿I don't know what's wrong with her, but she's acting weirder than ever. ﻿She comes and goes ﻿whenever she wants and hardly talks to me. ﻿She says she needs air. Do you understand that? "Air. ﻿I offer to take her to the countryside and she says ﻿that's not the air she means, she needs another kind of air. ﻿What fucking air. ﻿What the fuck should I do, buy her a bottle of oxygen? ﻿Okay, calm down. Everything will be fine. ﻿No, it won't. It will only get worse. ﻿Balance, Miralles. Balance is very important. ﻿We make scales, we know a little about that. ﻿So let's prove it. ﻿Bring us a bottle of wine. A good one. ﻿How's Miralles? ﻿Normal. ﻿Normal, bad. ﻿His wife... ﻿His wife told him that she needs air. ﻿-Air? -How do you interpret that? ﻿She's with someone else. ﻿Air? ﻿TUESDAY ﻿BLANCO, THIEF ﻿Hey! Hey! ﻿I've been calling you, did they tell you? ﻿You see that? ﻿Unbelievable. ﻿I told him, eh? The boss won't like it. ﻿Blanco, I called you on the telephone! ﻿Get him out of there any way you can. ﻿-I can't, boss. -Why? ﻿That land doesn't belong to anyone, it's not illegal for him to be there. ﻿I won't let him in, but I can't make him leave. ﻿I want my job back, Blanco! ﻿Look at my grave! You killed me! -You killed me, Blanco! -Come on! ﻿Yes, you did! Where are you going? ﻿You killed us! ﻿You killed us! Live with it! ﻿-Are you okay? -Yes. ﻿-Good morning. -Good morning. ﻿-Rubio. -I heard. ﻿That individual can't be out there when the committee comes. ﻿-We won't get the award. -Let me talk to him. ﻿You said "I'll handle it." And look where he is now. ﻿With banners. ﻿What do the banners say? ﻿What banners always say. Nothing good. ﻿Maybe if we raise his severance pay... ﻿Okay, negotiate with him. ﻿-Give him double. -Okay. ﻿Get rid of him. It's not exactly good for our image. ﻿-Have you seen Miralles? -I went down earlier ﻿but he wasn't at his desk. ﻿Miralles is not in good shape. ﻿Aurora! ﻿How are you? ﻿You can blindfold me ﻿and put a prune in one hand and a peach in the other, ﻿can tell you which is which from the weight. ﻿And the 1100 is the same. ﻿Because it has 800 photo-sensors, ﻿this size, it's amazing. ﻿It hasn't made it here yet, it will change your lives. ﻿I really don't care. ﻿I supervise the cash registers... ﻿Right, of course. ﻿Did my husband say something? ﻿Was he supposed to? ﻿He didn't send you? ﻿No, on the contrary. He doesn't even know I came. ﻿Please don't say anything, he'll kill me. He's very jealous. ﻿No, no. ﻿He's not... well. ﻿He doesn't seem well. ﻿I'm worried about him. ﻿Does he look okay to you? ﻿I don't see him much. ﻿He gets home late from work and... ﻿I leave early in the morning. ﻿The thing is, we're going ﻿through a difficult moment. ﻿A lot is happening this month. Inspections, ﻿technical checks, ﻿we had to lay people off and it's causing ﻿a lot of pain, especially for me... ﻿And we can't afford to have him working at half speed. ﻿My husband? ﻿And problems between a couple ﻿are normal, who doesn't have them? What movies tell you... ﻿Well... ﻿That's a lie. ﻿I have problems. ﻿Call my wife, she'll tell you. Shall we call her? ﻿No. ﻿That's why supporting each other is important. ﻿You have to be there. ﻿When things are bad because.. ﻿Are you there? ﻿Am I where? ﻿There, behind... ﻿your husband, supporting him. ﻿We're not going through our best moment. ﻿I could tell. Maybe... ﻿Maybe...? ﻿Maybe we both need some air. ﻿Air? ﻿Air. ﻿Breathe a little, get some oxygen. ﻿Air, right, I got it. I know what air is. ﻿Aurora, ﻿I shouldn't meddle in your lives, but I'm older. ﻿And old people are right about some things. ﻿Give yourself a few weeks, please. ﻿And then you'll see. ﻿But... ﻿please promise me you'll both try. ﻿And don't make any decision until the end of the month. ﻿-I have to get back. -Hey, look. ﻿Whatever happened, ﻿you can work it out. We all make mistakes. ﻿Did he tell you? ﻿Tell me what? ﻿About his affair. ﻿With your secretary. Three months in hotels. ﻿What? Inés. ﻿-Yes? -Shut the door. ﻿Listen, Inés... ﻿Is there something... ﻿that you think I don't know, but... ﻿that maybe... ﻿I should know? ﻿About what? ﻿Is there? ﻿I was going to bring it back on Monday. ﻿The printer. ﻿It's for my son, he has to turn in a paper on Friday ﻿and since we barely use it here... ﻿But I'll bring it back tomorrow. ﻿That's okay. Bring it back on Monday. We make between 600 and 900 units per year. ﻿Some weigh up to 3,000 kilos. ﻿Pretend I'm not here. Good afternoon. ﻿They weigh boxes, packages, ﻿nearly all the models have ramps for trolleys... ﻿These are for cattle. ﻿Resistant to dents, acid, detergent... ﻿They're specially treated against corrosion ﻿and have four cargo cells. ﻿You don't need one of these in the bathroom. ﻿And you're wondering why we need to know all this. ﻿I'm wondering too. ﻿To sell the product we have to get to know it first. ﻿-That's right. -Exactly. ﻿-How much do you weigh? -57. ﻿Get on, I'll show you something. ﻿I don't know how I would take if they put me ﻿on a scale for cattle. ﻿-How much do you offer for me? -Nothing. ﻿You work for me, you're already my property. ﻿56,800. Angela, can you step on too, please? ﻿It has a weight accumulation function... ﻿No way, there's no deal! ﻿My job! No deal! ﻿He said no. ﻿He doesn't want money, he wants his job back. ﻿He can't pay his mortgage, ﻿the bank is taking his home and he's staying there. ﻿Hire back the fired! ﻿Hire back... ﻿Just what we needed. ﻿The kid is in my daughter's class. ﻿The kids.. ﻿Can he have them there? Is that legal? ﻿He and his wife alternate and this week they're with him. ﻿That's right! Hire back the fired! ﻿How's the kid? ﻿Bad, because his friends come to see him, ﻿they gather outside the door and smoke... ﻿People get scared away ﻿and don't come in, of course. ﻿I remembered earlier what I had to tell you but I forgot again. ﻿I should have written it down. ﻿Something about... ﻿work or doctors? ﻿What does he want? ﻿Jesus! ﻿What's up? ﻿Look, there she is. ﻿-That's illegal. -It's on the Internet. ﻿They use it to rescue people lost in the mountains, it's called ﻿"geo-localization." ﻿It's called spying. You're not rescuing anyone, you're spying on your wife. ﻿You're invading her privacy, Miralles. ﻿The one invading her privacy is the son of a bitch in there. ﻿It's a crime and she can report you for this. ﻿My God. ﻿Are you sure she's in that house? ﻿I'm sure, I'm sure. ﻿But we're checking to be even more sure. ﻿She's moving, she's moving... ﻿I can't believe we're doing this. ﻿Where is she going? ﻿-To the bathroom? -What for? ﻿Why the fuck are you going to the bathroom? Stay in the living room! ﻿That could be the bedroom. ﻿It looks like the back part of a house. ﻿-Damn it, Blanco. -What? ﻿Don't say it's the bedroom. ﻿Why not? ﻿You make it sound like he's fucking her! ﻿You're the one insisting someone is fucking her. ﻿And you're insisting someone isn't. ﻿-Hey, look. -What? ﻿She's going around in circles. ﻿What the hell is that, some kind of fucking ritual? ﻿Let's go. You don't need to be here. ﻿You can do that at home too. ﻿-Who are the kids with? -Alone, they're old enough. ﻿They're not even 10 years old. ﻿I'm taking you home, wait for her there ﻿and when she gets home you can ask her anything you want. ﻿If she's not already home. ﻿It's moving real fast. ﻿What are they doing, having races? ﻿WEDNESDAY ﻿Rider... ﻿Spider... ﻿"You're like a spider." ﻿A little weak. ﻿"Blanco, slave driver, ﻿you're a slave owner." ﻿A little repetitive. "Hell." ﻿"Blanco, slave driver you will burn in hell." ﻿That one is good. ﻿Where's the rhyme? ﻿With driver. ﻿The rhyme is assonant, more modern. ﻿It's a sign. It doesn't have to be modern, it has to be efficient. ﻿You don't think "you will burn in hell" is efficient? ﻿Having a chat? ﻿He has coffee. A machine with capsules, like the commercial. ﻿Great, like the commercial... ﻿What do we do now, start a social club? ﻿If you like it so much, watch out, you might end up over there too, ﻿drinking coffee. ﻿I don't want you talking to him, in fact... ﻿that man is... ﻿boycotting the company that feeds you, show a little loyalty. ﻿Anyone who goes near him, write their names down for me. ﻿Like in grade school? ﻿Like in grade school, yes. ﻿Blanco, listen up! The people are not for sale! ﻿Blanco, listen up! The people are not for sale! ﻿He's not good at rhyming. ﻿Blanco, listen up! The people are not for sale! ﻿Asshole. ﻿Blanco, listen! The people aren't for sale! ﻿What about that? ﻿I called but they haven't come. ﻿We make scales. We can't have a crooked one at the front gate. ﻿Blanco. listen! ﻿The people are not for sale! ﻿Another coffee? ﻿Police? ﻿Look, I want to report a dangerous situation ﻿at the entrance to the industrial polygon ﻿right across from the scale factory. ﻿There's been a vagabond camped out there for a few days ﻿with some kids, I don't even know if they're his. ﻿Young, ﻿5 or 6 years old, not older. ﻿And the place is disgusting, it's full of mud, ﻿broken glass, they could get bitten by a rat... ﻿Thank you. A neighbor. I drive by there every day ﻿and it breaks my heart seeing ﻿those helpless children. ﻿It's urgent because there are minors involved. ﻿Yes, thank you, it's my duty. Thank you. ﻿Why are we stopped? ﻿Miralles again. ﻿But... ﻿-What is our problem today? -The micros. ﻿The new batch isn't compatible with the MS equipment software. We can't assemble them. ﻿Miralles isn't picking up his phone. ﻿Nobody told us anything. ﻿Can someone go to his house? ﻿No, no, forget Miralles. ﻿Solutions. ﻿Solutions! ﻿We can use the platform scales. ﻿They're compatible. ﻿We can send the display models ﻿and the rest two days later on... ﻿Thursday, which is a holiday, that gives us three days. ﻿It won't take an hour. ﻿I'll give you two and I'll buy your whole team lunch. ﻿The MS on the platform scales aren't reliable. ﻿What's for lunch? That crap you eat with dates and seeds? ﻿It's the fruit of paradise, show some respect. ﻿Whenever we reassemble equipment we have problems. ﻿I know. ﻿You don't eat enough dates, that's why you never get laid. ﻿Damn. ﻿Let's see. ﻿Find out if Khaled has a parking spot, please. ﻿This isn't my signature and without my signature the trucks don't leave. ﻿So get the fucking truck back. ﻿Then I'll decide if it leaves or not. ﻿Miralles. ﻿It was ready at AM. My people were already there loading at 5. ﻿I don't care, the truck doesn't leave without my okay. ﻿The shipment has to be in the warehouse by 10. ﻿Don't tell me what I already know! ﻿Khaled... ﻿Stick to your job, load the fucking trucks and stay out ﻿of my territory. ﻿I don't load trucks, ﻿I run Logistics. ﻿Khaled, I'm the Head of Production. ﻿Get the truck back. ﻿Do it now! ﻿They were trying to find you all morning. ﻿Where have you been? Tuck in your shirt. ﻿Your shirt. You think you can make ﻿a huge scene in front of everyone? What if the committee were here? ﻿Confirmed. She didn't come home the whole night. ﻿And she calls me in the morning to say she slept at her sister's, ﻿I go to her sister's ﻿but she won't let me in to see her, ﻿that she's asleep. Her sister! ﻿They can't stand each other. ﻿-Tell me. -Number 23. ﻿Okay. ﻿Stay here. Don't move. ﻿Don't do anything. Don't talk to her, give me your phone. ﻿-Damn, Blanco. -It's the company's, give it to me. ﻿And don't make any plans tonight. Tell your wife you're coming out with me. ﻿Let's see if I can get you to relax and forget about all of this. ﻿Fuck! ﻿Blanco! ﻿The police are outside. ﻿"You will burn in hell." ﻿What an idiot. ﻿Well, the phrase isn't bad. ﻿Maybe in this context, but in another... ﻿It's an assonant rhyme. ﻿What are you now, the poet security guard? ﻿Thank you. ﻿-Take care. -Goodbye. ﻿Come back if you want more coffee. ﻿-What's up? -It's all good. ﻿What's good? I don't see anything that's good. ﻿The car registration checks out, that lot doesn't belong to anyone. ﻿We can't make him leave. ﻿Everything belongs to someone. ﻿Have you found the owner? I don't think he would like ﻿that individual being there. ﻿It's public property, sir. It's his as much as it's yours. ﻿Wow, a socialist police officer. ﻿What about the kids? ﻿Can they be there? Is that legal? ﻿There's broken glass. ﻿And rats. ﻿Does the mother know? Or do I have to call her too? ﻿Talk to Social Services. There's nothing else we can do. ﻿Maybe we can buy it. ﻿-The land. -What about the committee? ﻿-I'll check. -You said he was harmless. ﻿Blanco, that's right! The people will always fight! ﻿Blanco, that's right! ﻿That one rhymes. ﻿Blanco, that's right! The people will always fight! ﻿Blanco, that's right! The people will always fight! ﻿Need a ride? ﻿It's not a good idea. ﻿Because I own the company and you're an intern? ﻿That's exactly why. ﻿Yeah, well... ﻿What am I supposed to do then? ﻿Sell the company so I can give you a ride? ﻿I will, eh? ﻿Come on. ﻿She doesn't work with me! ﻿We just met! ﻿Is this normal? ﻿Is what normal? ﻿For the owner of the company to visit the interns, ﻿to give them a ride home in his car... ﻿It's just that I don't like being locked up in my office alone, ﻿I want to be around my employees, take care of them all, because... ﻿they're my family, you know? ﻿The interns are my like my daughters. ﻿Is that wrong? ﻿-On the right. -I know the way. ﻿I picked out these apartments. ﻿Do you like yours? Are you comfortable? ﻿A little big for a girl by herself. ﻿Take down my number. ﻿If you need anything, ﻿call me. ﻿Go ahead. ﻿Hi, sweetheart. How are you? ﻿Can you take all of this home? It's lingerie. ﻿Okay. ﻿I had him organize the storeroom, it was in chaos. ﻿I remember what I had to tell you. ﻿I can't right now, Miralles is waiting for me. ﻿I'm trying to straighten him out, ﻿he's in a rut, he's.. ﻿Salva! ﻿Let's go. These are the last ones? ﻿We have to be strong and get through this thing. ﻿I want to know who he is. ﻿What for, it's better if you don't. ﻿It's just a guy. Mister X. It doesn't matter who he is. ﻿Mister X.. ﻿Mister P. ﻿It's a figure of speech. ﻿Mister P, better. ﻿Mister P, then. We don't care. ﻿Trust me, complete disregard. ﻿You're right. ﻿We don't give a shit. Right? ﻿-Careful. -I don't care who you are, Mister P. ﻿Mister P for "Prick." ﻿For "Prick fucking punk." ﻿No, no, no... ﻿For "Punch your fucking..." ﻿It's okay. ﻿That's not what I mean. ﻿Just ignore him. ﻿Disregard. ﻿-Disregard! -That's it. ﻿Disregard! ﻿Make drawers in your mind. ﻿Yeah. ﻿Put your wife and whoever the guy is in a drawer. ﻿In the P drawer. ﻿And the good things, ﻿your job... ﻿the kids... What do you like? ﻿-Bullfighting. -Bullfighting... In another. ﻿Awesome. ﻿How many drawers are there? ﻿That doesn't matter, they can be infinite. ﻿As many as you want! ﻿Infinite! ﻿They're imaginary drawers, Miralles. You don't have to carry them. ﻿Come on. ﻿-What's wrong now? -Nothing. ﻿I'm imagining them in the same drawer, fucking and... ﻿Damn it, Miralles. Put them in different drawers. ﻿There are plenty of women in the world, more than men, millions. ﻿You'll like one of them, Miralles. We always get hooked on just one, it turns out there are more. ﻿Go out, ﻿meet another, fall in love. There are lots here. ﻿This girl sitting right here, the Ukrainian. ﻿I don't know if she can sew, but look how pretty she is. ﻿Take her up to a room, it's on the company. ﻿Here. ﻿She's hotter than your wife. ﻿-Take two if you want. -No, no. ﻿We've been through a lot of good things together. ﻿And a lot of bad things, you've told me about some. ﻿I only want to be with my wife. ﻿You're being too fussy. ﻿Stop it, you have to be strong. ﻿And also realize that sometimes ﻿people can slip up. ﻿Right? ﻿Or are you totally free of blame? ﻿Look at these two! ﻿What do you think? ﻿YOUR DAUGHTERS NEED HELP! ﻿Calibration is used to determine the precision ﻿of the equipment and reduce uncertainty to a minimum, ﻿which is... How would I explain it? ﻿Whenever you measure something, you introduce an alteration. ﻿You modify what you're measuring. ﻿Did I explain myself? No. ﻿Like if you want to know someone and you actually never really know them ﻿because when you get closer the person changes. ﻿Exactly, that's right. ﻿When you get closer you modify their behavior. ﻿You just defined the Uncertainty Principle better than Heisenberg. ﻿You studied Physics... ﻿Marketing. ﻿Marketing, right. ﻿I don't know Liliana, I know what she's like when I'm with her. ﻿She looks down, she covers her mouth, ﻿starts smiling, she could be missing a tooth. ﻿Are you? No. ﻿Do I cause all that? I'd like to think ﻿I do, but I don't know. ﻿I don't know Liliana, I know ﻿this Liliana and who knows what horrible ﻿perverse things she does when we don't see her. ﻿It's better if you don't know. ﻿Well... ﻿Maybe I'm not how I seem either. ﻿And there's a secret Angela hidden out there somewhere. ﻿That's why justice covers its eyes. ﻿Not to be impartial. ﻿It covers its eyes to not influence what it judges. ﻿I like having my eyes covered too. ﻿I'm going home. ﻿-No, you're not. -Why not? ﻿Because I said so, I'm your boss. Here. ﻿Is he okay? ﻿He's fine. ﻿Remember, this goes in the drawer with the good things. ﻿Did you know Miralles and I have a scale inside? ﻿Here in our chest. ﻿Put your gin and tonic in one hand and my drink ﻿in the other and I'll tell you which is which ﻿-with my eyes closed. -No way. ﻿This isn't easy. ﻿This takes years of experience. Here we go. ﻿Let me put them at the same level. ﻿This is my drink. ﻿Cheater! ﻿That's not fair. ﻿It's liquid weight. ﻿Here, take one of these. ﻿This is nice lingerie my wife brings from France. ﻿Please, just hurry up. I'm not into mine. ﻿Don't worry. ﻿Let me see it. ﻿I like you. I've always liked you. ﻿That was pretty spectacular. ﻿Where did you get all that repertoire? ﻿I watch porn. ﻿On the Internet. ﻿Blessed Internet. ﻿How is the wi-fi here? If you need more megas let me know. ﻿My sign is Libra. The scale. ﻿It's a sign. ﻿We're balance and harmony. ﻿But we're ruled by Venus. ﻿-So balance goes to hell. -Right. ﻿And our ideal mate is Capricorn or Virgo. ﻿Are you Capricorn or Virgo? ﻿I'm both. ﻿Can I be both at the same time? ﻿Someone waiting at home? ﻿What makes you think that? ﻿Always thinking about fucking other men... ﻿-Miralles! -We're just talking... ﻿-Why do you do this to me? -Miralles, please. ﻿Get him out or I'm calling the police. ﻿-It's not fair. -I'll handle it, come on. ﻿Talk to her. ﻿Tell her please not to leave me. ﻿Please, tell her not to leave me! ﻿Talk to her, please! ﻿All good. ﻿What if she reports you? ﻿I didn't do anything to her. ﻿You were shouting like a madman, insulting her... ﻿If you cause the company any trouble... ﻿Her car is there. ﻿Okay, that's a good thing. Go on. ﻿I'm scared of running into her. Fuck! ﻿Everything scares you. Her being home, her not being home.... ﻿You can't take things so hard, ﻿we all make mistakes. Look where you're coming from. ﻿Because you took me there. ﻿Whatever the reason, you are, so you're even. ﻿Forgive each other and that's that. ﻿Go on. ﻿Don't come to work tomorrow, stay home. ﻿It's time for you to accept what's happening to you. ﻿Fuck! ﻿I know what I had to tell you. ﻿Liliana. ﻿Treat her like anyone else. ﻿The Urbinas' little girl, remember? ﻿The new intern, Liliana. ﻿They asked us to give her an internship for a few months. ﻿Rings a bell. ﻿She didn't want you to know, she doesn't want special treatment. ﻿Right. ﻿She's really changed, you probably didn't recognize her. ﻿No, I didn't. ﻿I talked to her mother today, they're coming to see her. ﻿You know what a nag she can be, since she's an only child. ﻿They're coming to dinner tomorrow night. ﻿What should I make? ﻿THURSDAY ﻿Have the new intern come up, Liliana. Give me her resume. ﻿Who has it? ﻿She's a friend of the family. Why don't people tell me anything? ﻿-Miralles hasn't shown up. -Yeah, I told him not to come. ﻿The less he's here right now, the better. ﻿-Any news about the committee? -Nothing. ﻿She didn't come in today. ﻿Liliana? ﻿This is Liliana, leave a message... ﻿Aurora. ﻿I need a minute. ﻿-Just one minute. -Blanco, not now, please. ﻿One minute and I'll go. ﻿-He'll give you the code, okay? -Okay. ﻿Come on. ﻿Miralles is in very bad shape. ﻿I've never seen him like this before. ﻿And I'm scared he might do something crazy, I think he's capable. ﻿I'm asking you to take it into account in your decisions. ﻿If not for him, do it ﻿for your children. ﻿How dare you! ﻿-Who are you to meddle in our life? -It's your life, ﻿but it's mine too, because what you do affects me too. ﻿And it affects my business, deliveries, the award... ﻿Aurora, ﻿please return to register 6. ﻿Now. ﻿Our problems are none of your business. I'm sorry, but if they hurt my company they become my problems... ﻿Aurora, please... ﻿I'm coming, damn it! Give me a fucking minute! ﻿Look, there's an easy solution. Just stop banging my employees. ﻿I bang anyone I want. ﻿Boss! ﻿What do you think? ﻿The dress. ﻿For dinner tonight. ﻿I didn't bring anything formal. ﻿And you know what my father is like. ﻿He's older, like me. ﻿We missed you at the factory today. ﻿I told her not to go in. ﻿Great. ﻿And we're going to the hairdresser's later. ﻿Being the boss' favorite has its perks. ﻿You're telling me. ﻿Doesn't she look beautiful? ﻿Gorgeous. ﻿-Want to try the mint green? -Yes. ﻿-You didn't sleep enough last night. -Yeah. ﻿I need you to buy dessert for dinner. ﻿Will you go? ﻿Yes. ﻿Very nice. ﻿Will you take her? ﻿I'll take her. ﻿I didn't want privileges. If something happened between us, it was meant to. ﻿It wasn't meant to happen. ﻿I'd hate for you to see me now as the Urbinas' little girl. ﻿You are the Urbinas' little girl. ﻿can't see you any other way. I went to school ﻿with your father and I carried you in my arms, Liliana. ﻿Good morning. ﻿The Black Forest, large. ﻿And.. ﻿the Russian pastry, please. ﻿There's something else I didn't tell you. ﻿Please, tell me everything, always. ﻿My boyfriend is coming with my parents. ﻿That makes everyone. ﻿I know, I couldn't avoid it. ﻿I didn't have time to explain the new situation to him. ﻿What new situation? ﻿This, the two of us together. ﻿Don't worry, he's just a boy, I'm not in love with him. ﻿That's exactly what worries me. ﻿Heisenberg was right. ﻿People change. ﻿I change when you're near me. ﻿I'm someone else. I don't recognize myself. ﻿It's pretty scary. ﻿Liliana, sweetie, ﻿try to be yourself tonight. ﻿The same old Liliana, with your parents and my wife. ﻿Can you do that? ﻿Sure you can ﻿-You want the truth? -Yes. ﻿This situation turns me on. ﻿Here you go. ﻿What do I owe you? ﻿-Forty. -Forty. ﻿BLANCO STOP LAYOFFS ﻿A little higher... higher... ﻿Brutal. ﻿Seduce me, come on. Hold the banner up higher. ﻿Like this? ﻿Show me some truth. ﻿Great, brutal. ﻿-How about this? -Brutal, I love it. ﻿Blanco, tell him about the layoffs. ﻿If you have the balls. ﻿What's going on? ﻿He asked if I want to be in the article too. ﻿I didn't say yes or no until I talked to you first. ﻿-Good morning. -Good morning. ﻿What are the photos for? ﻿-For an article. -An article. ﻿-About what? -About his struggle. ﻿-About his... -His struggle. ﻿His struggle, right. Does your boss know you're doing this? ﻿It's a human interest story, what people like now. ﻿It's an absurd story. There were layoffs, he was paid according ﻿to the law. There is no story, period. ﻿What are you doing? ﻿Writing down your statement. ﻿Let me see. ﻿It's not a statement. ﻿What's wrong with you? You can't print this now. ﻿Don't lean on my car, please. ﻿Were you put up to this or was this article your idea? ﻿That information is private. ﻿-I have to protect my sources. -Sources, right. ﻿Who do you think you work for, the Washington Post? ﻿Can I get a photo? ﻿Don't you dare. No way. ﻿And not the factory either. Román. ﻿Don't let him take photos here. ﻿What about from across the street? ﻿I thought security guards take an oath. Did you swear to be an idiot? ﻿If I see a single photo ﻿of the factory in the paper, you're fired. ﻿Freedom of the press. ﻿Ignacio? ﻿Listen, there was a kid here, ﻿the one who did the article last week. ﻿Look, I respect all that ﻿about it being a human story. ﻿He's not a dog or a cow, he's a man, so it's definitely human. ﻿But... ﻿But you need to understand that this week is complicated. ﻿We have the award thing, you printed a story about it. ﻿Yes... ﻿And that photo is not helping right now. ﻿Ignacio, we're here to help each other, you always say that: ﻿"I help you and you help me." ﻿Yeah, a healthy democracy. ﻿I'm fucking sick of healthy democracy. ﻿Everyone is healthy and free, but what about my health? ﻿That doesn't count? ﻿Ignacio. ﻿Ignacio! Fuck, I'm losing you. ﻿Look, I told you what I think, from here it's up to you. ﻿I can't hear you, damn it. Ignacio! ﻿She's the wife of a coworker. ﻿Excuse me? ﻿She's the wife of a coworker and I don't want you to see her again. ﻿That's my problem. ﻿Another one. ﻿Do you people think only you have problems and I don't? ﻿My problems are your problems too, Khaled, ﻿and if things are bad for me, they'll be even worse for you. ﻿If you have a problem with Miralles, talk to him. ﻿Look... ﻿You're hurting the company. ﻿So leave Aurora alone. ﻿We're both adults ﻿and we like to fuck. ﻿I'm good at what I do, I do my job well ﻿you pay me, end of story. ﻿Look. ﻿That kind of behavior is not allowed at Blanco Scales. ﻿It's not. ﻿What are you going to do? ﻿Fire me? ﻿Don't give me any of that family crap, look at my skin. ﻿I'm not your son. ﻿Only missing an Oscar. ﻿That one there is the Oscar of scales. ﻿Der Schöne Ritter. "The Just Knight." ﻿It's a German certification company. ﻿The one shaped like a scale? ﻿It's not a shape, it's a scale. ﻿And the open spot above it, we'll be filling soon. ﻿We're finalists for another award. ﻿-Who gives it? -The regional government. ﻿For excellence, which has to do ﻿with transparency, management... ﻿It's important for subsidies. ﻿Otherwise the artists hog them all. ﻿How exciting! ﻿-And how is it looking? -Good. We have some issues to work out. ﻿With your employees? ﻿They're not happy? Employees are never happy. ﻿You raise someone's salary, say 100 euros. ﻿And the next guy 50, half that. So you make that guy more unhappy ﻿than if you hadn't given either a raise. Do you understand that? ﻿That's why he doesn't give raises to anyone. ﻿They're a mystery. ﻿You never really get to know your employees. ﻿The Uncertainty Principle. ﻿Heisenberg. ﻿That's right. ﻿Scale stuff. ﻿Nothing is exactly the way we perceive it. ﻿We aren't us. ﻿We change, ﻿depending on who's looking at us. ﻿No? ﻿Yes, more or less. I was thinking, talk to Albert tomorrow. ﻿I need you two to prepare ﻿a full-page ad for the local newspaper. ﻿-And the briefing? -Urgent, that's the briefing. ﻿Exciting, isn't it? Seeing you two work up close. ﻿How long will you be staying with us? ﻿Nothing, one month ﻿and she's gone. Mobility is good, you have to keep moving. ﻿But she just got here. ﻿Yeah, but if you stay in one place for too long you get stuck. ﻿I don't have any plans, you can hire me if you want. ﻿It's always better to change companies. ﻿Different types, textiles, motor... ﻿Learn about everything. We'll find her somewhere. ﻿It sounds like you wan to get rid of ter. ﻿Not get rid of her, stimulate her. Stimulate her. ﻿If the job is good, great. If it isn't, you move on. ﻿We don't want any favoritism, do we? ﻿You and I never got anything for free. ﻿-And we're not doing too bad. -Exactly. ﻿Hard work and humiliity. ﻿Well, you inherited the factory from your father. ﻿So did you, Jandro. ﻿Well, you have to be there. ﻿Where, at the notary? Because to inherit, ﻿that's all it takes. ﻿Inheriting is also a responsibility. ﻿Look at Liliana. ﻿She inherited her mother's beauty. ﻿Isn't she beautiful? ﻿He didn't recognize her, you know. ﻿-Really? -I swear. ﻿What did you say when you found out who she was? ﻿"One month here and you're gone. ﻿I don't even want to see you." ﻿I wouldn't be surprised! ﻿No, really, I'm very grateful for you taking her in. ﻿She could hold any position at my company, ﻿but she preferred to work with you. ﻿That's great. ﻿I know you'll take care of her like your own daughter. ﻿Of course. ﻿Knowing him, he'll be on top of her all day. ﻿Not long ago she was a little girl. ﻿You had her on your knees, you fed her a bottle. ﻿It seems like yesterday. ﻿Totally. ﻿FRIDAY ﻿Open the wall. ﻿Boom. boom, who is it? ﻿The dove and the olive branch. ﻿Open the wall. ﻿Boom. boom, who is it? ﻿The scorpion and the centipede. ﻿Close the wall... ﻿This can't be, it can't be. ﻿He asked for permission to use the company bathroom. ﻿What do I do, let him in? ﻿Workers go on strike! ﻿No, don't let him. ﻿He says his stomach hurts. ﻿Then he can go take a shit at his wife's house. ﻿It will be worse, he'll do it right there. Román, do not let him use the bathroom. ﻿What else. ﻿My ears hurt, from the bullhorn. ﻿I got otitis when I was little and they're very sensitive. ﻿What do you want me to do? ﻿Take you to the doctor? ﻿You always say we should tell you our problems. ﻿Not all of them, for God's sake. ﻿Blanco, you're a rati Let the people take a crap! ﻿Blanco! ﻿Assonant rhyme, right? ﻿Natalia, darling, how are you? ﻿Has the mayor got a second for me? ﻿He's in a meeting, he can't speak right now. ﻿It's important, a criminal matter. ﻿There's a homeless guy camping across the street ﻿and that land is... ﻿public, so he can't be there. Imagine if there's an accident ﻿or if anything happens, City Hall is publicly liable, ﻿-I checked. -I'll tell him. ﻿The mayor wants to know if you got the invitations ﻿for the ballet tonight. He's expecting you and your wife ﻿in his box. ﻿I have the invitations, thank you, but please, ﻿tell him what I just said, it's an important matter for the community. ﻿I'll tell him. ﻿"Publicly liable," say it like that. ﻿With those same words. ﻿I will. ﻿Thank you, Natalia. Thank you, goodbye. ﻿The committee. ﻿They were at Farmacol this morning. ﻿We're the only ones left. ﻿Hold this. ﻿Please, take it. ﻿Fuck. ﻿What do you want to leave? Tell me. ﻿-What do you want? -I called you 20 times. 20. ﻿You should have answered the phone, it's too late now. ﻿How much do you want? ﻿Ask. How much? ﻿I don't want anything. ﻿Not your money or the job. Nothing. ﻿You can stick it all up your ass. ﻿Don't make things worse, José. ﻿How can I make things worse? Tell me. ﻿I can't have my children with me. ﻿I'm almost 50 years old, who will hire me now? ﻿-How can I make things worse? -You can't be here. ﻿Think about your kids, damn it! They're being made fun of at school! ﻿Hold on. We'll fix this ﻿between you and me, all right? ﻿What job do you want? ﻿Yeah, think about it. ﻿Take your pick. ﻿You want his job? His? Which one? ﻿I'll give it to you. ﻿You're the prodigal son. ﻿You know who the prodigal son is? ﻿You're the prodigal son, damn it! ﻿Yes! ﻿Yes, you are. ﻿You are. ﻿I won't move. ﻿I'm fine right here. ﻿I've never felt better. ﻿You can offer to let me sleep in your bed with your wife. ﻿I won't move. ﻿Over there, you're the boss. ﻿Not here. ﻿I won't move. ﻿I won't move. ﻿I won't move. I will not. ﻿I will not move. I will not move. ﻿I will not move. We're here for real, we will not make a deal. We're here for real, we will not make a deal! ﻿Blanco, go fuck yourself! ﻿Son of a bitch! ﻿Bastard! ﻿Look, Blanco! ﻿That's right! My ass has joined the fight! ﻿Look! ﻿Fucking wacko. ﻿-He's crazy, he won't listen to reason. -Let's see... ﻿The people united will never be defeated! ﻿I thought they fixed it. ﻿Eat shit! ﻿Goddamn it. ﻿Fuck you! ﻿Son of a bitch! ﻿Blanco, you're a rat! Let the people take a crap! ﻿Blanco, you're a rat! Let the people take a crap! ﻿That's right! ﻿You can eat shit, Blanco! ﻿I need you to do me a favor. ﻿Excuse me, I'll be right back. ﻿-Blanco. -Not now, not now. ﻿I need to talk to you. ﻿Ask my secretary for an appointment. ﻿You wanted me to treat you like everyone else, right? ﻿Are you okay? ﻿JUSTICE USES BLANCO SCALES ﻿The layout here is simpler. ﻿More space for the product... ﻿I think the contrast between the photograph ﻿and the illustration works. ﻿The concept is to highlight the idea of justice with the committee coming. ﻿The company worries not only about results... ﻿Can the robe be shorter? We can try it, yes. Justice is sexy. ﻿Yes, and we can prepare more ideas. ﻿We can work with the idea of loyalty... ﻿Albert, you decide. ﻿As long as what we pay for does the job. ﻿Get me Ignacio, please. ﻿How long is the new intern with us? ﻿-Liliana? -Yes. ﻿The contract is one month, ﻿-but we can renew it. -When it's over, she leaves. ﻿I don't want her here. ﻿Ignacio. ﻿How are you? ﻿Listen, I have something for you. ﻿Hold... Hold on a second. ﻿I'm going to make you an offer you can't refuse. ﻿Yeah, like in the movies. ﻿I have the committee coming to visit and... ﻿was thinking of putting in a full page on Sunday... ﻿Clean, dean. ﻿Nice and clean, nice and clean, ﻿cleaner than I've ever seen. ﻿Fucking scale. ﻿You're a scab. Román. ﻿An ass wipe. ﻿Don't look at me! Join me, you turncoat! ﻿Don't look at me! ﻿Join me! ﻿Don't look at me! ﻿Blanco! Blanco! ﻿Thief!! ﻿Blanco the exploiter! ﻿Live with it, Blanco! You're a thief! ﻿You were right, Román. I should have let him use the bathroom. ﻿Here. ﻿They have an inhibitor. ﻿You can thank Fortuna when you see him. ﻿-Thanks, boss. -You're welcome. ﻿Oh, Román, Román. ﻿Well... ﻿I've spoken too harshly to you lately and... ﻿I have no right. ﻿I apologize. ﻿This hasn't been easy. ﻿What hasn't? ﻿These last few days, with José across the street, ﻿with his kids... ﻿Having to fire people, damn it. ﻿And poor Miralles, his wife has him in the dumps. ﻿The arguments... ﻿I have to do things I don't want to do for the good of the company. ﻿It's like a surgeon... ﻿who doesn't want ﻿to amputate. ﻿Who wants to cut off someone's leg? ﻿The surgeon? No. ﻿I don't think the surgeon likes cutting off someone's leg, ﻿but he has to do it. Just like me. ﻿I have to do it. ﻿For all of you, ﻿for your families as well. ﻿Do I want to do it? No, I don't. ﻿But I have no choice. ﻿-No what? -Choice. ﻿Take this as compensation. Here. ﻿"Romeo and Juliet" tonight. ﻿It's a ballet. ﻿-I've never been to a ballet. -Exactly. ﻿It's about time, take your wife, be nice to her, ﻿otherwise look what happens, look at Miralles. ﻿Impossible, it's at 8. I'll still be here at that hour. ﻿Leave early today, it's okay. ﻿I'm the boss, right? Then that's that. ﻿And don't tell anyone. ﻿Blanco, look at me. ﻿Here I am, I'm not moving! ﻿I will not move! ﻿I'll be here waiting, Blanco! I will not move! ﻿Didn't the mayor invite us tonight? ﻿To the ballet. ﻿Yeah, maybe he forgot. ﻿LILIANA INTERN ﻿It was "Romeo and Juliet," wasn't it? ﻿Yes, tonight Romeo and Juliet ﻿will be you and me, my love. ﻿There are a lot of them today. ﻿It's Friday. ﻿Ladies and gentlemen, ﻿the performance is about to begin. ﻿Please turn off your cell phones and watch alarms. ﻿It's starting. ﻿Thank you, Alina. ﻿What are you thinking about? ﻿Nothing. ﻿I know what you think about when you say nothing. ﻿Get out of here! ﻿Stop! ﻿Stop, please! ﻿Scum! ﻿Get the fuck out of here! ﻿Filthy pig! ﻿Get up ﻿Pig! ﻿I said get out of here! ﻿Asshole! ﻿At this hour? ﻿Let it fucking burn! ﻿Clown! ﻿Where are you going? ﻿Hey, you! ﻿Get up! ﻿Fortuna, what's wrong? ﻿Boss... ﻿What happened? ﻿What happened, Fortuna? ﻿Hey... ﻿Let's go. ﻿Sons of bitches! ﻿Come back here! ﻿Come back if you've got balls! ﻿Come back here! ﻿Bastards! ﻿BLANCO SCALES WON'T FORGET YOU ﻿He was an extraordinary kid. ﻿Extraordinary, really. ﻿He helped me a lot in the shop. ﻿-He was a good kid. -Yes, he was. ﻿I'm going to give your husband ﻿a bonus so you two can take a trip together. ﻿And get some rest. ﻿Rubio already knows, he'll handle everything. ﻿Don't worry about anything. ﻿Excuse me! ﻿Bring that over. ﻿Excuse me... ﻿Let's see.. ﻿If you'll allow me... ﻿I'd like to say ﻿a few words on behalf of Fortuna because ﻿he's not feeling strong enough. ﻿We've lost.. ﻿We've lost a promising young man ﻿and no words can describe ﻿such an injustice. ﻿So as a tribute, ﻿with his parents' permission, we're going ﻿to name the new generation of scales we're developing after Salva ﻿so that his memory will stay alive ﻿anywhere you find a Blanco scale. ﻿Those of us here, we all know each other. ﻿We're a big family ﻿and now we have to say goodbye to those who move on... ﻿Let's go. ﻿My feet are frozen... ﻿Blanco, excuse me. Can we talk? ﻿Not here, Miralles. Tomorrow at the factory. ﻿MONDAY ﻿Talk about bad luck. The one day I leave early... ﻿Well... ﻿Have someone clean all that up, please. ﻿I want it clean when the committee arrives. ﻿Give me a bullet. ﻿JUSTICE USES BLANCO SCALES ﻿The judge saw him this morning. ﻿They might set bail, but he can't pay it anyway. ﻿-And the committee? -They're coming tomorrow. ﻿Yes? ﻿Yes. ﻿Okay. ﻿Thank you. ﻿He's here. ﻿Okay, then. ﻿Have Inés come in. ﻿Inés, stop what you're doing and come in the office. ﻿What's up? Good morning. ﻿Julito. ﻿What's up? ﻿Sara, how's it going? ﻿What is this? What's going on here? ﻿What are my things doing there? ﻿Who told you to move in here? ﻿Why is that fucking Arab in my office? Why isn't he loading trucks? ﻿Miralles, don't talk that way about a coworker. You want some coffee? ﻿The gentleman has a name, his name is Khaled and, well, ﻿he does it better than you. ﻿No, I'm the best. I'll prove it to you anytime. ﻿Well. ﻿Let's see.. ﻿Blanco... ﻿I'm better, much calmer, give me a break. ﻿It's a delicate moment, Miralles, and we need people ﻿at 100% and who will do anything ﻿for the company, like me right now. ﻿Or do you think I like doing this? No. ﻿I have to cover my eyes. ﻿I have to set personal issues aside, ﻿emotions as well, and choose the best man for the job. Blindly. ﻿-I have no choice, Miralles. -Julio, please. ﻿I have nothing. Aurora is leaving. She's taking the kids with her. ﻿This is all I have left, my job. Scales are my life. ﻿You're not going to help me? ﻿Miralles... ﻿-Miralles... -You're not going to help me? ﻿Miralles, look, take it easy. ﻿You help me. ﻿Help me. ﻿Remember that time we were ﻿in the car together, when we were 10 years old? ﻿You helped me so much. ﻿It wasn't me. ﻿What? ﻿I didn't take the blame. You're the one ﻿who put the rifle in my hand and told my father ﻿that it was me. ﻿-That's not how I remember it. -And I'll tell you something else. ﻿Our fathers never went hunting together, ﻿my dad loaded your dad's rifle, which is very different. ﻿He loaded his rifle. ﻿Okay, okay, okay. ﻿I won't make it easy for you. I'll go to the labor department. ﻿I'm not José, I know a lot ﻿about how this company works and I've saved paperwork. ﻿Just like Inés. ﻿What a coincidence. ﻿She saved your messages too. ﻿Yes. ﻿But she's not going to report you. ﻿What are you talking about? ﻿She told me about that little issue you two had. ﻿That wasn't very nice, Miralles. ﻿Taking advantage of your position in the company to abuse the secretary. ﻿Damn! ﻿No, it wasn't like that. I didn't abuse anyone. ﻿That's not what I understand. ﻿But I convinced her not to report you, ﻿a favor I'm doing for you. ﻿In exchange, ﻿you take the severance pay Rubio gives you, whatever it is, ﻿and you leave. ﻿I never want to see you again. ﻿I remember what my father used to say: ﻿Sometimes you have ﻿to trick the scale to get the exact weight. ﻿Inés, come in. ﻿Great news, I already heard. ﻿I'm opening a Chateau Laffite to celebrate. ﻿What news? ﻿What are we celebrating? ﻿You hiring Liliana, she told me. ﻿I talked to her mother and she went crazy. ﻿She wanted to send you flowers, I said absolutely not. ﻿And a boss. ﻿-A boss? -Head of Marketing, can you imagine? ﻿How do you think Albert will take it? ﻿Who is Albert? ﻿Her assistant. ﻿Your advertisement was beautiful. ﻿And the concept of justice, ﻿that it's not just making good scales, we're talking about a company ﻿that is fair, that worries about its employees. ﻿That's great for the award. ﻿That was the idea. ﻿told her to move in with us here, the upstairs bedroom. ﻿Better than that apartment. ﻿She said it sounds perfect. ﻿Perfect. ﻿She can keep us company in this big house. ﻿Alina was preparing it, I'll see how she's doing. ﻿I'll get you a glass. ﻿Do I even need to say how much you're paying me? ﻿WELCOME TO BLANCO SCALES ﻿Liliana Urbina, our brand new Head of Marketing. ﻿Young and energetic, and most of all, a female point of view, ﻿essential to any company. ﻿Okay. This way. ﻿Khaled Ga... I won't even try to pronounce his last name. ﻿Head of Production. ﻿Being cross-cultural is very important in this company because ﻿it reflects the world we live in. ﻿Khaled is like a son to me. ﻿Adopted. ﻿This way. ﻿...but he experienced a terrible loss very recently, his youngest son. ﻿Stay strong! ﻿Cheer up! ﻿HARD WORK, BALANCE, LOYALTY ﻿AWARDED TO BLANCO SCALES ﻿Fortuna... ﻿It's... ﻿THE GOOD BOSS
