Subtitles from :.* almastro_almastro *.: Over the past 250 years - - We've made the biggest scientific experiment ever. Since the Industrial Revolution - - We have sent 1.4 trillion tons of coal straight out into the atmosphere. It has changed life on earth, especially in the Arctic. The world's melting snow and ice has caused climate change - - threatening life on earth. But the worrying vision of the future need not be written in stone. It has long existed alternative to fossil fuels. We recently discovered a way to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere - - which gives us a chance to reverse climate change. If we manage to return climate change - - It would be an accomplishment that lacks in the history of humanity. But the clock is ticking. The researchers say we have to Take the measures immediately. The seriousness of the situation requires us listens to the impartial experts. They've presented facts like those have devoted their lives to developing. It's their turn to be heard. They are scientists, researchers and innovators - - who have found solutions for that preserve life in our common world. ROCKY MOUNTAINS COLORADO Some projects require manual sampling. One of them applies CO2 emissions over a longer period. Someone must venture out and take the test every Tuesday. I am the one who can go out with the snow car and make the measurements. The long-term protocol should be conducted as always. Monitoring and registering what we do with our atmosphere - - Is an important but difficult task. The last 50 years have dedicated researchers from all over the world - -rest every week to the same places- - to measure the greenhouse gases that causes climate change. We are at just over 3 400 meters, up on Niwot Ridge. It is located in the front edge of Rocky Mountains in Colorado. This NOAA station for long-term sampling of CO2 values. These glass cubes used to take the samples. When we have filled them with air We send them to our office. On NOAA's lab in Boulder the samples are analyzed - along with similar tubes from the rest of the world. The reason why the samples usually taken so high - is that the air is so well mixed here. The sample corresponds to the whole atmosphere. There is a small opening in the ceiling. When I turn on the pump sucked the air into the tubes. These measure the carbon cycle and the greenhouse gases -There CO2 and methane are the largest. When they took the first test in 1968 showed it at 322 ppm. We don't know what this sample shows yet- - but it's probably around 408. And that's an increase. Now I stop everything and everything do the work for next week's test. One of NOAA's assignments from the beginning was to measure CO2 in the atmosphere - and other gases which affects the carbon cycle. Two kinds of samples are collected weekly from all over the world. We want to see how the gases change over time. To do that, we take constantly new samples. Right now we have 60 collection points. The samples are mostly taken in remote places, far from inhabited areas. With this equipment we measure It's carbon dioxide, methane, carbon monoxide, molecular hydrogen - nitrous oxide and sulfur hexafluoride. The system is running five days a week. I assemble the air samples the manifold and start the measurement. Then I can leave. I am the head of NOAA's Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network. The goal of the global network - is to produce data fully calibrated - carefully checked and documented. The information is equally reliable in a hundred years or more. So, according to climate change continues in the future - there is information for the researchers which they can rely on. Then they can diagnose what really happened - and how climate change really works. The modern CO2 measurements started by Dave Keeling- - at the oceanographic institution. In 1956 he took samples along the west coast. He saw that in the afternoon, wherever he was - - so was the concentration the same everywhere. Then he was struck by the thought that there may be something - We can call "Background concentration". He began regular measurements at Mauna Loa in Hawaii -and also on the Antarctic coast. Towards the end of the last ice age, between 20,000 and 11,000 years ago - increased CO2 levels by 80 ppm, from about 200 to 280. It went slow. It took 6,000 years for the CO2 level to rise by 80 ppm. Sixteen years. Before the industries arrived, before 1850, the CO2 level was around 280 ppm. And today we see an increase by 2 ppm per year. That increase is due 100 percent on man. The increase we see today, compared to the geological history - I should almost call an explosion. It is instant, from a geological time perspective. Carbon dioxide has risen dramatically since the industrial revolution. What does that really mean to us? We know too much carbon dioxide damages the climate. It changes the weather behavior and life support system - - which we depend on to survive. We have always known that toxicity associated with fossil fuels- - But we always thought that it would attack the human -or other living individuals. It is not until my lifetime - as it has become frighteningly obvious- - the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere has got the heat to rise. The greenhouse effect affects life on the planet as a whole. Once I understood it in the mid 90s - we needed to start talking about it, which we have done since then. When we're talking about dangerous global warming - we mean when it's about two degrees Celsius warmer - compared with pre-industrial time. This is when we start to see the worst - and maybe irrevocably effects of climate change: Melting Polaris, which gives rising sea levels. Permanently dry at warmer latitudes and much more. It will be disaster about the larger ice melts - on Greenland and West Antarctica. Then all major coastal towns are affected in the world of flooding. The areas on land are decreasing. The result is environmental refugees, when people leave those regions. People leave the tropics because it gets too hot man. The crops in the tropics are affected the heat and production will decrease. In short, it becomes a world with less surface - less food and water, stuck with more people. That's the recipe for a national security disaster. I have worked with to measure carbon dioxide for over 30 years. If only we had done something ate this for 20 years ago- - I had done something else today, but I am left. Looking at the relationship between carbon dioxide and sea level - is there a couple of interesting moments: When CO2 levels rise to 400 ppm - the heat may loose large ice blocks from Antarctica and Greenland. The ice blocks are what we call marine based. The base of the ice deck in western Antarctica is below sea level - Because it is stuck in the sediment. Once it starts to melt it becomes a runaway train. No one knows how to stop it. We are dangerously close to it right now. The next threshold is around CO2 levels of 600-700 ppm. Then it is so hot that it does not exist some landis remain on the planet. Then the sea level becomes about 80 meters higher. We are heading for 600-700 ppm. It is an interesting threshold moment regarding our relationship with the planet. Should we press our climate system so much out of balance - that we risk to digest all landis? Yes, it has changed. Iceland's nature has been affected of climate change. It is clearly visible along the southern coast, for example. Our largest glacier, Vatnajökull, or the "water glacier" - - has decreased quite a bit. There is an interesting observation which everyone notices -When they drive along the southern coast today. When you drive over Iceland's longest bridge, which is almost a kilometer - You notice it almost There is no water underneath. Why are you building such a long bridge over almost no water at all? It depends on climate change. The river has changed direction because of the glacier's decline. Now we have a kind of monument- - which symbolizes the past. The Arctic is a changed place today. Here is the climate change impact as most extreme. The researchers notice that what is happening on the Arctic - has a big impact on the rest of the planet. I work with measuring greenhouse gases at the Arctic station - and to find out how vaxthusg I'm worried about it rising temperature in the region - and the impact it can have on all Arctic systems. I think that is extremely important to be aware of- - that the sea ice decreased and all other changes - can change the entire weather system, which has a global impact. We know the changes in the Arctic are not limited there. I have worked with the sea ice the past fifty years. The entire Arctic has changed very much during that time. Not enough that the ice has decreased in area. The decrease is really visible. The great ice creams from - with their ramparts of pack ice and very thick ice cover ... Much of it dramatic scenery is gone. I recently visited the Bering Sea for research purposes. In that region is usually found very melted, but we saw no one. HISTORICAL BLOCK ON THE SEA: 1.8 - 4.5 meters The ice was very thin, maybe just 30 centimeters thick. The North Sea is no longer a continent of ice. It's just water in the summer. It's a huge loss, not just by nature's beauty- - but also with regard to the physics of how the planet works. The ice disappears if the climate gets warmer. It is an obvious consequence, but is worse than that. There will be many chain reactions - - that affects the planet much more than only the ice creams decrease. The Arctic is heated three times faster than the rest of the world- - whereupon the temperature difference between The Arctic and lower latitudes decrease. That means the jet stream becomes weaker. It is weakened from to have been an almost straight line - to become more wavy and reach both north and south. This can mean that the polar air reaches down to lower latitude - Like that usually only when in a sector - but in the sector to the east or west of the - Hot air comes further north than it should. The result is the bizarre weather that people have talked about. When the air masses cause so extreme weather changes - it happens to be at the latitudes where most food is produced. Suddenly food production is affected of the polar changes. One cannot remove as much ice without affecting much else. Arctic's strongest sea ice divides the first time since the measurements began Consequences of our actions begin to show itself. Researchers' predictions rather than expected. We may experience storms, drought, floods and fires - - which is gradually becoming more and more intensive and unpredictable. NEW HEATING CORDS OVER ALL PLANET LAST WEEK THE WORLD BRINS AND SWIMMERS OVER CLIMATE CHANGES ARE HERE BURNS IN CALIFORNIA 2018 SEED FROM THE SPACE HOT HOT MONTH AS EVER HAVE BEEN RECALLED ON THE EARTH THE RESEARCHERS ONLY KNOW A CASE: IT WILL BE WORSE The fires began almost simultaneously in several places. More than 7,000 buildings were destroyed of which about 3,000 homes. In the beginning when the fires were like the worst - maybe evacuated 100,000 people. It is a collective trauma. It sounded and looked like a war zone. Hanley-fire reached here after 24 hours. It burned roughly same impression here in 24 hours. Near 200 buildings were burned down. This fire started in the evening and reached Santa Rosa in four hours. They cannot be compared, besides the prints. Commander who came here to lead the rescue work- - just shook his head: "I've never seen anything like it." "And I've been with a long time." It's hardly any comfort, But that's where we are now. With such winds, how do we protect citizens and infrastructure? What can we do to it? stop as good as possible? Where has suffered five years of drought who hit bushes and trees. The wind forces up at Geyser Peak measured at 48 meters per second. What to do when it blows so hard and a fire occurs? One can only try to figure out its direction and how fast it goes. I never thought that the fire would leave the mountains -and smooth Santa Rosa with the ground. Cars have been evicted. Large pieces of glowing coal - brought by the wind, a good bit in front of the fire. You see trees with broken branches. They have not been burned off, they were broken off. natural disasters has become so common now- - that people know that they will suffer. It's not the question, but when. It is an alarm clock for everyone. Climate change is here -and you have to plan for it. Climate change causes more species are endangered. But that's not the first time. Studies of geological findings has demonstrated a connection - between high carbon levels and the latest ones five periods of mass death. It's a natural law to carbon cycle affects the structure of life. Every time a massive increase of the colonies have taken place - - the motley weave of life has weakened and sometimes collapsed. MIT ATMOSPHERE AND PLANETARY RESEARCH I have worked with carbon cycle connection -with the presence of mass death - and whether the carbon cycle is unstable when it happens. The carbon cycle is there life and the environment interact. You can see it as a big one circular flow between photosynthesis - which is the process as takes carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere - converts it to oxygen and plant material or organic carbon. The reverse reaction in the circle is called respiration- - which is when the plant material converted to carbon dioxide. During a completed lap takes the carbon cycle around 100 gigatons of coal - from the atmosphere and the seas, and return it every year. So it's 100 gigatons out, and 100 gigatons back in. Of this, we contribute 8 percent, with fossil fuels. An increase of 8 percent compared to what had circulated normally. That's more than what the volcanoes supply the system. The planet is constantly working to restore the balances. It's the water cycle, the nitrogen cycle and the carbon cycle. You can see it as a constant flow. One way for the planet to do it was to take everything - that was in the dinosaurs and the plants on land - and squeeze it together for oil and fossil fuels. It was hidden for a very long time, And we are a very young species. But we were curious and dug up - the coal that the earth had hidden away. Then we burned it up without understanding that it was like burning furniture - Indoors with closed windows. What happens is that the planet backs back. There is a surplus of coal in the atmosphere. It leads to the living conditions- - here on earth is put out of balance. As a biologist, when i see climate change - I see rising sea levels and melting polaris. I see that as evidence. But when we look at it how biological organisms - responds to the warmer temperatures, they have already started to move. They move towards the poles to cool down. They move upwards from lower mountain areas. Whole areas of distribution are moved. Sometimes they also move without their helpers. If a plant moves north does not cope with its pollinators. In a scientific, boring language you call it ecological disturbance. If we change the conditions who created all this ... Even us. Then we come ... It will track down. When the carbon cycle is unstable Do the things we don't understand. On the geological time scale are there events - within the carbon cycle, where things changed. One such was the paleocene eocene thermal maxima, 55 million years ago. Then there is much worse, disastrous events - in the form of mass extinction. The worst is called Perm-trias extinction. 95% OF EVERY LIFE DOG OUT FOR 250 MILLION YEARS LATE Then the story looks, but we do doing today is another problem- - We know what is going on. We know that we have added CO2 by using fossil fuels. Then the question is whether it is at risk to induce similar events - as we have seen in the past. I would call it instability in the carbon cycle. When small changes turns into big changes. It is a scientific definition of a disaster. But at individual level is the loss of one's home a disaster. Climate change will cause the world's largest refugee crisis Climate change soon a threat to biodiversity Rising temperatures threaten to eradicate wild animals and plants Climate change is killing corals in the Great Barrier Reef The changes threaten ancient trees, But that's not all We are all climate refugees now We can still avoid it dangerous break point at two degrees. But for every year that we are passive- - it becomes increasingly difficult to limit our carbon emissions - and stay under the two-degree heating. UN climate conference 2015 Paris, France World leader celebrates the Paris Agreement: "A big step for humanity" KOLKLOCKAN: Time left before the budget is spent We know we've sent out too much carbon in the atmosphere. But how much is too much? The researchers have come up with what that figure is - - and has entered a carbon budget which shows what margin life has. The budget shows where we are today, how much more coal we can burn - - and how much must be removed to sustain life on earth. The biggest challenge is, according to me dangerous climate change. If we want to avoid dangerous climate change, we must realize - that atmosphere, like human waste disposal site has its limit. We can release about 800 gigatons of CO2 in the atmosphere -in that limit. But over the past five years have we already released 200 gigatons - which means that in two decades - We have already used up our limited space. In Paris it was important that the leaders of the whole world agreed - to limit the temperature increase well below two degrees. That's the safety margin and it is important- - that more than a hundred nations stand behind it. If you think of the volume in the ball symbolizes the CO2 - still in the ground in the form of coal, oil and gas. Here we have the amount of coal. If we want to limit the increase up to two degrees globally - Let's just let go this is a little carbon in the atmosphere. At the same time we have much more coal left in the ground - not going out into the atmosphere about the increase should be kept below two degrees. The question is therefore how it should go together? The next 20 years are an enormously important time span. We must separate the financial growth from the growing emissions. At the middle of the century, we must be down in zero emissions - and after 2050 we need even negative emissions. The charcoal clock only informs humanity about where we stand today. It shows how we dispose of the limited space in the atmosphere. It's a huge challenge for Humanity. Science says the climate crisis is a problem we ourselves have created. But that's also a problem we can solve We must stop dropping coal and transition to renewable energy. It is also vital to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Climate change is possible turn back - if we act now. Research has found solutions that can reduce the amount of coal - - So we end up in level with pre-industrial time. NORWAY CALIFORNIA Redwood forest There are only two measures that helps the atmosphere. You either stop greenhouse gas - or you lower the CO2 level. That's all. The first one can be done through more efficient and cleaner energy. The second is through photosynthesis. Either through agriculture and forestry - or plankton and kelp in the seas. There are only two measures. That way it's pretty simple. Previously, all solutions have always just focused on energy. Energy, energy and energy, which is fully understandable. Of course it is a good idea to stop CO2 emissions. But when the emphasis has been put on clean energy sources such as sun and wind - He's almost ruled out the remaining solutions. Drawdown: To reverse climate change by pulling coal out of the atmosphere. The purpose of the drawdown was to redo the 80 solutions we had developed - could return global warming within 30 years. From reducing to turning down. The emission curve shows that we have a choice. If we increase the scope of some of the solutions- - we can achieve drawdown around 2050. I agree with the odds is against us, but I must take it. My name is Linwood Gill. I am the chief forest guard at Usal Redwood Forest Company. Usal Redwood Forest is a general forest - owned by the non-profit foundation Redwood Forest Foundation. The forest is 50,000 acres. The purpose is to preserve the forest, partly as an economic security - and to protect it natural environment for animals and fish - but also to remove coal out the atmosphere. It is one of ours main mission right now. It is an important part of the fight against climate change. Usal Redwood Forest is a very young redwood forest. Redwood can absorb more carbon than any other tree variety on the planet. Through their needles, the trees absorb carbon from the carbon dioxide in the air. Then the coal is stored in the trunk, roots and branches. As far as I know, this is here one of the country's largest coal projects. I am a bio fertilizer project manager at the Redwood Forest Foundation. We have great concerns here in California- - with over a hundred million dead trees. We have to do something about it. Here is a beetle called Western Pine Bark Beetle - who are living on chewing themselves yellow and also other trees. They have been here for thousands of years - and have lived in harmony with the trees. But because of climate change and the prolonged drought - has millions of trees become very weak - and has difficulty defending against the beetle. Bio fertilizer can be a way to attack the problem of beetles - and the dying trees in Sierra Nevada. Bio-fertilizer is a form of coal which is useful in farming -and gives a more prosperous soil. When dry distilling the wood biomass - half of the coal can The biomass is recovered as residual waste. The biomass helps the soil through to bind nutrients and water. It's more like a kind of construction who incubates life. Almost half are used of all the coal in the plant - which will be better use in cultivated soil. It is of enormous benefit for agriculture. We have large amounts of biomass need to be used. The trees constitute a fire hazard while the fires are raging in California. By producing bio fertilizer can we bring back some of the material - to the forests safely. Or we use the biomass in the valley, where water is really needed. One of the benefits of bio fertilizer is that it binds water in the soil. If we added biofertilizer in ten percent of the world's cultivation soil - we should isolate 29 billion tons of CO2. 29 billion tons with ten percent. And just by using - "leftover residual material". It is significant. Then we have the climate compensations. For us to get them we must employ multiple - who works with the forest and can attest to the clients - that the coal we say we have actually there -and stays here in the future. I like to see ourselves as an example who can inspire others - to do the same as we do. This is not rocket research. Carbon storage becomes huge in the future. We need more and bigger forests. Forests that should never be felled and remain forever. My name is Kate Scow and I am a professor in land-air and water resources- - at the University of California, Davis. I am also an earth microbial ecologist. The carbon cycle globally involves both water and terrestrial systems. Soil is an important part of the terrestrial system. Soil contains 2-3 times more carbon compared to the atmosphere. The earth is the place there crops grow best. That means that everything that grows binds CO2 via photosynthesis - and miraculously creates a physical mass here on earth from air. It still fascinates me. The process captures coal, the plant binds CO2, it dies - the plant falls to the ground and becomes part of the carbon cycle. There is much more coal bound in the soil than in the atmosphere. Organic farms do not produce any nutrients from artificial manure. The manure consists of organic material. It can be medium crops or compost - as food, plant or animal remnants as you plow into the earth. In an organic farming system can you add- - eight times as much coal compared to a regular system. It's really quite simple. Climate change gives us the chance - to change our behavior on this planet. We know what we are capable of in the worst case, so now the question is ... If we deliberately want to be part of the healing process ... ... it can release our creativity. Then maybe you realize that you have a garden. "Oh my God," I have a park nearby. We should see ourselves as we helping to save the planet ... It is much better than seeing us like nasty little children with matches. Then you realize that we are all small pieces of the solution. Now we send directly from my mentor's house. The organic gardener Ron Finley. I always want to come here and learn different ways - - to use the small soil I have and grow as much as I can. Culinary climate measures is what I want to see. What I grow sucks out coal from the atmosphere. It shows that we can return it back into the earth again. It creates both green jobs and counteracts problems that- - diabetes and obesity in the area where I live. There are many plots and plenty of water available. It's for a good cause and gives a nice result. We pull out the toxins from the atmosphere - which we ourselves have released. Best way to transform them is to grow something edible. Grow on the roof, grow in the window. We know how it gets warmer. A farmer must have faith in the future. No doomsday mentality. You have to plant, water and believe that it will be a harvest. That is the discussion I want to see when we talk about changing the climate. It doesn't happen overnight, But we must start now. It's time. My name is Bren Smith and runs Thimble Island Ocean Farm. We are in the Thimble Islands in the Long Islands Sound. I grew up in Newfoundland in Canada- - jumped off the plug and have fished all over the planet. In Gloucester in Newfoundland - Then I worked on the Bering Sea for many years. Then the industrialized fishery went at high speed. We tore up whole ecosystems with our trawlers - and chased less and less fish all the way out to sea. It was completely unsustainable. Much of the fish I pulled up would be food at McDonald's. It was an alarm clock for many from my generation. I was out on the Bering Sea when the cod market crashed. Thousands of people became unemployed, factories were beaten again. It taught me that you can build a culture for several hundred years - But if you don't protects resources - can collapse the ecosystem delete everything in a few years. That was when we began to realize that problems like overfishing - and climate change are not environmental issues - for us who work at sea. They are financial problems. There is neither food nor jobs on a dead planet. When I realized it was unsustainable I began to look for sustainability. I retrained myself to oyster fishermen. The oysters taught me that nature have created constructions- - millions of years ago which alleviates our harmful effects. We do not need advanced technology. Nature gives us seaweed and seafood - that binds five times more carbon than terrestrial plants. An oyster filters 189 liters of water per day, which removes nitrogen. My job as the ocean's chieftain - is to take advantage of nature's constructions and cultivate them. It's pretty simple. It's great to grow restoration species is that nothing is required. No fresh water, no food, no manure and no land. It is the most sustainable food production on earth. Kelp is this beautiful seagrass. The gateway to the new kitchen. One of the fastest growing plants - and sucks up five times more carbon than terrestrial plants. It's called Sea Sequoia. Kelp is just the beginning. There is 10,000 edible plants in the seas. Parts of the plant we can make kelp noodles. Then this can be manure and animal feed. If cows eat seaweed feed decreases methane emissions by 90 percent. Still, cows, sheep and goats have eaten kelp for hundreds of years. On the Hebrides, in Maine and elsewhere. There are incredible volumes. We can produce 20 tons of kelp per acre - and 150,000 seafood. Imagine this in larger scale - to an area of ​​Washington state. Then you can give the whole world food. Take five percent of US territorial waters and - 50 million new jobs are created - and coal equivalent 20 million cars are bound. Our crops also soften acidification of the oceans. Kelp creates a so-called halo effect - which reduces acidification. Then oysters and other seafood - easier to get thicker shells which protects better against acidification. Some said that climate change would take a hundred years. But it happens here and now. As a fisherman we are lucky to be able to move to something similar. I'm proud to help to arrange food for my country. Maybe I'm part of that army who will save the planet. If we send out ten large units CO2 in the atmosphere. -And about stay there. 2.5 of them end up in plants and 2.5 ports in the sea. If the sea is acidified, what do you do about it? Nature takes care of the problem by making more seafood. It is the theory of marine snow, that small animals grow in the water - They have calcium shells falling down. The problem is that the planet wants it a perspective of millions of years. We don't. So the question is if you can speed up the process? We need to examine all options. There is more experimental hypotheses that need to be tested. A solution can be found in it microscopic life cycle marine snow. What do we need? We need this planet as it was before. We must regain it in that condition It was 200 years ago. Higher levels of CO2 increases the acidification of the oceans. The garden then loses its ability to suck up coal from the atmosphere. We have to do something about it. We must help those systems circulating carbon - between the atmosphere, the plants on land and seas. And with marine snow just need some help from us. The most important thing is to remove CO2 and produce oxygen. What we can do is to add minimal amounts - iron in the seas. Very little. It has nothing to do with the term fertilizer. To give you an idea just need six kilos of iron - to start the process in 100,000 square kilometers of the sea. The cells create an organic parent tissue - Which is why the design of marine snow. When the mother tissue arises- - it attracts cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria - which colonizes the particles and then actively growing. Then we let them take care of themselves - - Because they can take very long time. We can trace the marine snow particles for more than four months. They can float around and suck organic matter - and when they get too heavy they sink to the bottom of the sea. Speed ​​of change, increased levels and temperatures - make sure we have to act while we can. I'm absolutely sure that we can succeed with ... ... to get man to cooperate with nature, do not oppose it. Science has long been proven that we have technology that works. -and that it's already used. It's just a matter of political will and size. We need a lot of solutions going forward in parallel. To solve the crisis - We need to move on one hundred percent renewable energy now. Of the top five solutions ended up coastal wind power in second place. COASTAL WIND POWER PLANT ORKNEY ISLANDS, SCOTLAND Wind power is more efficient than solar power, which was a surprise. Solar power will be in place eight out of ten. The sun is the largest resource we have. Everything else fades in comparison. We've known that for a long time, but we have never been able to - extract it economically. It has changed now. Solar energy is already cheaper than fossil fuels. Already installed in the 80s Jimmy Carter solar cells at the White House. Then Reagan took them away. Not until 2001, when Germany started with solar energy in larger scale - we could start to benefit from economy in large scale. In the end, we can provide the whole electricity grid with solar and wind power. We just need it be able to store wind and sun. If you want to cater for the whole US electricity demand with solar cell alone - we would need a surface on 77,700 square kilometers. The energy from there would suffice electricity networks in all states throughout the United States. Mount Signal is a project that provides electricity to 70,000 households in San Diego. The second phase of the energy will sent to Southern California. The cost of electricity from Mount Signal is lower than electricity from fossil fuels. The cost is also safe for use. The price is fixed the next 25 years. It is not offered from fossil energy sources. We have already integrated much solar power in California. Ten years ago, people said that it was impossible- - but today solar energy already covers up to 25% of California's needs. Taxpayers got none increased costs and everything works. And we got reduced carbon emissions in the purchase. Lately, state works offered to buy solar cells. The attitude is changing. We still underestimate the value of solar cells. People do not know that in five years are the solar cells much cheaper- -and can be used at night. In combination with wind power - we can live in an environment with 100 percent renewable energy. It is fully feasible. No new inventions are required. We already have the technology. We just have to make sure that those responsible for - planning of resource use and infrastructure - Understands this technology becomes cheaper over time. The coal is coming back. Clean coal, 100 percent. My government is stopping for the war against the coal. We should have clean coal. Really clean. Think Progress: Clean energy employs multiple - than fossil fuels do, in almost all states The Independent: World-leading carbon company closes 37 mines when solar prices fall Fossil producers under pressure Solar energy beats its own record with the cheapest electricity- - "compared with all other technologies ever " It can be difficult to communicate science to the public. Today, we assume the challenge - and adds an extra effort behind. Interest groups funded of fossil fuel operators -designs climate discussion- - to confuse the public and the decision makers. We must transform the entire energy sector - - quit fossil fuels and switch to renewable energy. But it gets pretty awkward for the powerful fossil industry - who have invested millions of dollars in creating a dependency on them. They have struggled hard to maintain that dependency. We are often asked how we can know - that the increased CO2 level in the atmosphere depends on human activity. The answer is that we leave climate footprints after us, around the atmosphere. One such imprint is called carbon-14, or radioactive carbon. When we burn coal, oil and gas we leave an imprint in the atmosphere -of what we call negative carbon-14. Because fossil fuels are so old there is no carbon 14 left anymore. We can specify the quantity with precision fossil fuels we consume - by measuring C-14 in the atmosphere. It is nature's own verification systems we use. They have convinced enough and have enough - to make it even more difficult than it was before - to address climate change. It's so depressing. The agenda of many of them fossil fuel companies - is malicious in view of the devastation that affects our planet. I think parts of it well-financed climate denial - performed by people who really know better- - is a crime against humanity. They should be brought to justice in The Hague. While the climate deniers has managed to delay the action - - has a lot more ominous problem appeared. Recently, researchers have seen elevated levels levels of methane in the atmosphere. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas - with the potential to enhance further temperatures. An increase in methane suggests that we are approaching a critical point. But where does the gas come from? And how much does it accelerate climate disruption? The researchers are stressing to find out. This is the University of Wyomings mobile laboratory. Here are instruments that measure what is in the air we breathe now. That way we can track emissions and gases - and find out were the sources of the emissions - And what leads to elevated methane levels. Inside the lab There are a couple of instruments. Here is a Proton Transfer Reaction Time of Flight Mass Spec. It measures volatile organic matter such as benzene and toluene. Here is a Picarro Cavity Ring-Down that measures the methane concentration. We can read all the data from real-time instruments - thanks to an intake on top of the car that draws in air to the instruments. After the measurements we arrived that we have more methane sources - in areas where we extract the gas, than we had expected. To be able to specify where the methane leaks are- - one must be near the sources. The mobile lab helps us to locate the largest leaks. The company has opened a brand new facility. 22 new gas sources have been drilled in the middle of the settlement in Western Greeley. The facility has been controversial, regarding size and location. It is said that society does not have been able to keep up with what is going on there. A high sound level surrounds the business- - And the state probably doesn't do its best to facilitate communication. We saw a lot of flames, which indicates large volumes of gas. The yellow color of the flame shows that it is not full combustion. We shall continue to investigate the sources Some oil and gas producing regions have such a large - concentration of methane in the air that it is visible from space. It happened a few years ago in the region of the four corners. That's the key for us when to find out In 2014, NASA researchers identified in collaboration with NOAA- - University of Michigan and other researchers - a methane cloud like Delaware in the region of the four corners. It is the largest accumulation methane gas throughout the United States. This ranch, where we are now, is the approximate zero point. If you could find the midpoint on the Delaware-shaped cloud - It would very well be here. One has been identified that the cause of methane cloud - mainly emissions in connection with drilling - as well as emissions from coal and other fossil fuels. The methane cloud was identified by the technology that NOAA and NASA had - due FLIR camera arrival. There are infrared cameras that look leaks, emissions and flames - which causes the methane cloud to grow. You have to see the whole picture. It has been at least 60 years - of leaks, emissions and burning here in the San Jaun sink. Over 30,000 sources has got methane cloud - to accumulate and provide evidence for - what drilling for natural gas leads to ultimately. People do not know common sources has created methane cloud - and that they themselves daily have been accomplices. This is a common gas source. This equipment is available - throughout the San Juan sink and on many other gas fields in the United States. This leaks considerably from the standard parts on it. All that is needed here is a wrench and a little teflon tape. A little review would fix the leak. I wish I could ask investors in gas and oil here - where I stand and let them see that leak. Let them multiply it with 18,000 in the San Juan sink - and make them stop obstructing a federal rule - protect my family, protect taxpayers in New Mexico - and offer fair and equal protection in all states. Get them out of the boardroom and come here- - and let them look at the leak which is so easy to cook. When I was told that environmental manager Scott Pruitt- - knew that there were facts - that strengthened methane and other leaking chemicals - are more harmful to children than they are for me. Then I became so angry that he wanted prevent federal protection for us. If anyone came to my ranch with intent to harm my child -It would be over my dead body. 250 million years ago became one secondary effect of methane emissions - that much of life on the ground died out. Now it is discussed around the methane found in the Arctic - in the permafrost or in the sea of ​​the world. How fast can methane be mobilized and how destructive it becomes? Release of ancient methane can lead to even more warming. Will the methane be created an apocalyptic scenario? It's a question that researchers have desperately trying to answer. I am the head of the Center for Gas Hydrate, Environment & Climate. We are a team with 50-60 researchers who works to understand us- - what impact methane has on the global climate system. Methane is stored below The bottom of the Arctic Ocean - in places we sometimes know, but we usually don't know much about them. We apply geophysical methods to quantify the reservoirs - and to see how stable The methane hydrates are today and later. Fortunately, methane has a short lifetime. The earth has a natural system which regulates the supply of methane -from the garden and out into the atmosphere. The system works quite well - but it changes, because the ocean currents change - just like the garden temperature and the garden chemistry is changing. The methane was in a kind of equilibrium mode - but in recent years we have seen a large increase in methane. We don't know where it comes from. Of course it puts it pressure on science - to give politicians an answer regarding methane in the atmosphere. Where does the methane come from? What else becomes unstable at present? We have presented some clear campaigns where we have measured - by the seabed, in the sea, at the sea surface and in the air, - to understand how methane is regulated throughout the system. There is a lot methane stored in the seabed. So much to the slightest change can have an impact - on the ocean or the atmosphere. META MEASUREMENTS IN NORWAY ISHAVET The balance here needs more focus and more observations- - where you combine atmospheric, sea ​​and climate competence. In my profession I study how methane seeps into the sea -In the Russian Sea and in the Barents Sea. It is simply gas bubbles rising from the seabed. The bubbles consist mostly of methane gas. First we have gas hydrates which is in solid form and similar to ice. The gas is also available in free form, which becomes gas bubbles. The plumes of methane bubbles may vary. In some places they can be 800-900 meters long. Depth in these areas is just over 1,200 meters. In shallower water reaches the bubbles almost up to the surface. The East Siberian Sea is definitely interesting when studying methane -As it is so shallow there. There is a great chance to the methane bubbles reach the surface. In some areas, such as Spetsbergen, There is methane that almost reaches the surface. We've warmed up the atmosphere so much - -We've started melting the Arctic. Potentially, we are facing an abrupt climate scenario. Today's calculations show that we passes the Paris agreement with raw up to five degrees and more. It triggers even more disastrous events. The heating can lead to big ones supplement of methane in the atmosphere. It should really worry us. I want to add that it is one of many possible stressors. We are approaching a high-risk situation where we lack experience. We don't know how should deal with it. PERMAFROST: Land that has been constantly frozen and containing methane and CO2 Permafrost and methane are great concerns. I think we should be more attentive - on methane in general, in relation to the climate problems. The risk is that you passing the breakpoint - where it then becomes difficult reverse the trend. PERMAFROST AREA ALASKA There is a perfectly reasonable one feedback mechanism. There are huge amounts in the permafrost organic matter frozen. The amount potentially can become CO2 and methane - can be four times bigger than everything fossil fuel we have consumed. 30,000 year old methane bubbles up from a frozen lake If we thaw up all frozen material - the most likely emission of CO2 occurs and methane gas in large scale I study methane emissions from lakes. We are in inner Alaska where we have discontinuous permafrost. We look at microbial methane. The methane that bubbles behind me comes from dead plants and animal - which was frozen into the permafrost tens of thousands of years ago. As the permafrost tinar- - Eat the microbes in the soil and make it methane. The thawing permafrost fire on methane production. Then the methane disappears up in the atmosphere What worries us is that as the climate gets warmer- - at a faster pace than the last 10,000 years - and let go methane gas faster. Highly concentrated methane is flammable - So if it's a flame it is methane. Many new lakes have been formed as not existed here 30 or 60 years ago. The lakes contain 10-100 times more methane than the other lakes. They give a picture of the methane emissions as we can expect- - the next 10 to 50 years as the permafrost thaws. Then comes the permafrost feedback cycle and it accelerates even more. Is it methane? Is it permafrost? Is it the organic coal in the seas who suddenly move again? You have to ask about it is there feedback in the system? The answer is yes. It is usually common sense - that the less you disturb the climate, The better it will be. We have the solutions ready, but the question still remains. We can mobilize and act collectively before it is late? The will to do so is not really there. The Paris Agreement says that we must reduce carbon emissions - and keep the temperature below a certain level - Although we won't to do that. What can save us is technology that sucks CO2 out of the atmosphere. Then you should bet all the resources of humanity- - to develop CO2 purification methods which works. Then we can save the world, So why don't we? CLIMEWORKS GET IN CO2 FROM THE AIR Direct Air Capture is machines which removes CO2 from the air. We have worked with technology over the past ten years - -and as economical as possible. The machine consists of four containers and can have any size whatsoever. Here the air is sucked in ... ... and inside there is our filter construction. When CO2 is captured ends up in a greenhouse. Similar is happening nowadays, solid with fossil CO2. In the future they will come to use atmospheric CO2. The facility does that you can stop the carbon cycle. The CO2 that gets into the greenhouse also ends up in cucumbers and tomatoes But because we capture CO2 again the circle is closed. This can be the missing cake bit - - needed to stop the carbon cycle in the energy or transport sector. In addition to using CO2 in a greenhouse like this - can we take CO2, water and renewable energy - and of it produce fuel, for example, aviation fuel. To capture one percent of the global CO2 emissions - about 300,000 needed of the plants behind me -Which is a very high figure. But compared to today's the infrastructures - it is an extent that we can handle, so it is definitely possible. Hellisheidi power plant for geothermal energy in Iceland The next project is a plant in Iceland- Two hours later you do CO2 to a stone - that keeps it permanently and safely. To operate the plant we use geothermal heat. It is abundant in Iceland. It hardly gives any carbon footprint to operate the machinery. It's a great day. We have received The CO2 plant to Iceland. We pull CO2 out of the air, pumps it down underground - and store it in the rock below us, where the carbon dioxide is bound. So we take CO2 from the air and turn it into stone. Last night was the first time that atmospheric CO2 was introduced into the ground. We can come up in millions of tons of CO2 per year - which can be extracted from the atmosphere. As far as we know it is the first time in the world- - as direct capture of CO2 has been combined with - with underground, safe and permanent storage of CO2. We have a new relationship with coal. Can't find us a new use for it? Can't we have it in plastic or building materials? We may be able to convert carbon dioxide to something we need every day? A LOW LIGHT UP THE WAY My name is Daniel Nocera and I am professor of energy at Harvard. In the lab we invented the artificial and the bionic leaf. They can perform a complete photosynthesis. Sunlight, air and water they convert into fuel and food. Think about photosynthesis. What is it doing? It makes life's building blocks. The building blocks are CO2, water and sunlight. Then we build all this. Wood, food, starch and biomass. It's an incredible transformation. Photosynthesis is complicated, but we really listened to nature. And we did that for 30 years. What makes me so happy- - is that we are not just can make it artificially- - but also ten times better than the real photosynthesis. We developed catalysts that covered the artificial leaf. They split the water in hydrogen and oxygen. The second part of the invention is the bionic leaf. It takes nitrogen from bacteria and manufactures fuel. Depending on the genes i put into the bacterium - I can get the bacterium to manufacture materials, medicines - and we've shown that they can make fertilizers. We can use all kinds of water. Plain water, sea water ... You only have my artificial leaves one can do it in the garden. We don't have to dig it up like that are there and release more CO2. The artificial leaf in collaboration with the bionic - takes CO2 out of the air and uses sun and water to make fuel. So we don't add any more CO2 to the atmosphere. Another thing is the cost. I-countries have added fantasy sums to build what they have today. It is difficult to abandon one billion investment that you have paid off. That's what it's all about. Therefore, guidelines are required and good collaborations. And that the public gets to know that they have alternative -and that the world can change. The green economy creates already millions of jobs. It will surpass the economy from the fossil fuel industry. The challenge to reverse the climate crisis provides new opportunities for everyone. It's now more profitable than ever to be green. Until recently, more was earned to create problems - even coming up with solutions. The solutions therefore required subsidies that hardly existed. The alternatives were altruism or belief. Then a transition took place where the profit from the solutions became bigger- - than the benefits of the problems, which is not so easy to understand. It does not mean altruism Not needed, it's something great. But altruism will not be required to take the step towards a world- - where we turn the heating, because it is cheaper. It's more profitable, more affordable and creates more jobs. It's the most amazing which has happened for several years. And it will only grow as the years go by - Because engineers and designers - which are largely unknown, works diligently to develop - a new way for man to relate to the planet. ORKNEY ISLANDS SCOTLAND Here at Orkney we have a very strong maritime tradition. Ever since the 70's has the oil and gas industry in Aberdeen - been important to the economy and created tens of thousands of jobs. But in recent years we have seen a large turnaround - concerning the oil and gas industry and the oil price. But we have many experienced people from offshore jobs on the way in. They find new jobs within renewable energy -hos company like us. Tides are almost a completely unused energy source. We believe we have the potential to achieve a capacity of at least 100 gigawatts. That means low-carbon energy to millions of households. Here we see the world's most powerful, floating tidal generator. It is a floating platform with two fixed rotors. When the rotors spin electricity is produced - brought up to the machine, where it is conditioned. Then the electricity is transformed and carried out into the power grid. It's like a wind turbine, fixed with two rotors instead of one. A few weeks ago we made great progress. We had our first 24 hours with uninterrupted electricity production. It actually worked far better than expected. The device itself generated over 18 megawatt hours during the day. We are moving towards more traditional ones methods in renewable energy. We put the tide on the map as a competitive alternative - Worldwide, and the world needs. The turbine is 63 meters in total. We convert the energy on board so that it is completely clear- - to be exported straight out in the UK electricity grid. We aim for tens of thousands of tidal turbines. It's a complete system - for production of low carbon energy. EMEC was built as a test lab - because we know there are huge amounts of energy in the world's oceans. We try to find a way to extract it. We realized that it was important to have a test center - where we could find out how this would happen. From the test center we have cables leading straight to the sea - like the developers of the machines can connect. Then the electricity is brought in - and straight out in our national electricity grid. They create electricity from seawater. Now we have the Penguin device here, made by the company Wello Oy. Their machine basically consists of a large pendulum inside the ship. As the ship moves spins the pendulum horizontally. It generates energy. The sea is ruthless and always trying to damage the equipment - so to bring out equipment that is reliable, robust, efficient, profitable ... All the developers wrestle with that. But we have already managed to create gold. We've actually transformed sea ​​water for energy. It's huge, because people has questioned it for years. No one can claim that the researchers have not warned us- - and said that we must reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It should be crystal clear. How many breakpoints can we pass- - or that most of life on the planet does not manage? It must not go so far. And we're so fucking close now. Either we hold the course and drowning, burning up - and starve to death as a result of the climate crisis. Or has the game just begun? After all, we have the knowledge and solutions that can turn global warming. Don't mitigate or reduce it. We can turn it around. When setting high goals new opportunities are opened. It opens the imagination and opens for innovations. It does not exclude anything, rather the opposite. It's not that it exists a single solution - but in collaboration one can achieve results with 80% of the solutions. Each solution has great advantages that makes the world better for everyone. We lose nothing to realize that climate change is going on- - and that we are affected. So what's the problem? We are the first generation who see climate change - - and the last one with a chance to fix it. Despite all the evidence - fossil fuels are still used at an ever increasing rate. Science has given us the truth, based on real research. It's time to start listening and apply the solutions available. Time is out soon. Ice melts. Resolution measures must be taken now. There is no other option. The opportunity is within our reach. Now we take it. It's up to each of us - - to save our unique blue planet for future generations. Subtitles from :.* almastro_almastro *.:
