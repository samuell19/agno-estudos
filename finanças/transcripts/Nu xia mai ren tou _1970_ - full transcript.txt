A young woman eighteen years of age. She blames her parents. You could do anything, why keep me at home? Xiaohong, can you hear? The lyrics are similar to what the lady thinks. No, the lady will marry soon, why'd she blame anyone? Shut up. Where's Master Mei? I've been waiting for his return. Stop it. Alright, I'll stop. Hey, you think the lady will get married this time? Rubbish. Our lady is beautiful and so talented in arts. Master Luo wouldn't turn her down. All we have to do is eagerly await the wedding banquet. Master Mei's back, let's go. Sure. Master. -Thanks for your help. Have a seat. So? How did it go? Master, please don't be mad. It wasn't successful. Luo Hongxun turned down the proposal. Damn it! Is our daughter that bad? Master, Luo Hongxun said... Go on. He said he's not good enough for her. Bullshit. His father is an official, I'm a robber. He's just being sarcastic. Damn! So short-tempered. If you yell like this, Bilian will hear you. She'll once again be heartbroken. I don't think Luo Hongxun is a man who won't keep his promise. Let's think of something. Miss. So? Master Luo refused. Hello, Bilian. I heard Luo Hongxun said... That's alright, I know. If I've your skills, I would have taught him a lesson. What else did he say? He said something really awful. He kept saying that we've a bad reputation as a family. And he told everyone that you're a shrewd. A robber's daughter can't be a decent woman. Very well! Luo Hongxun! Mother, why are you hiding? Am I the only person who would marry Hua Zhenfang's daughter? Oh, you won't listen to me? I dare not. Go on then. Mother, you... There are people who take care of me here, just go. Say hi to your aunt when you see her. Yes. Qing-erh. Coming... Don't drink and don't mind others' business. Yes, I know. Don't worry. Miss Bilian. Miss Bilian, let me explain. Please let me explain. -Master. -Hongxun. Hongxun. Are you alright? Are you alright, master? Are you hurt? If I didn't fake an injury, she wouldn't stop. How could you marry a girl like that? I think Miss Hua likes the master. Shut up. Mother, I can't leave now. I must pay a visit to the Hua Family. Explain to her father. That's not the place you should go now. Forget it! Don't bring this up again. Very well, Luo Hongxun. What happened, old timer? Damn it! I want my daughter back. Madam, Miss Hua is missing. She was here a while ago. Where's she? Gone. Look. Miss Hua didn't say anything, but kicked down our front door. Yes. She almost killed Hongxun. Yes. I'm sorry, madam. When we've found Bilian, I'll bring her here to apologise. What are you waiting for? Go get her. I'll look for her. Hongxun. Miss... Miss... Bilian. Stop calling our lady by her name. What are you talking about, brat? Xiaohong, come on. Xiaoxiang, come help me. I can't, my pants are torn. I want my daughter. You must find my daughter. I want her back. You must find her. Stop it. You must find her. Stop it. He lost her in a bet. A gambler. No, Fugen never gambles. A certain Wan Sanju who's from a local gambling house. Wan Sanju. Wan Sanju is interested in Fugen's wife. Fugen was tricked to bet with him, and he lost his wife in one bet. That's right. You gambled your wife away? How much? Ten taels. Poor woman! Calm down, that's enough. I'll give him ten taels. Swordswoman, Wan Sanju is a cunning man, he's not easy to deal with. Oh, where's the gambling house? In town, called Hongyun Hall. That's Wan Sanju. Fugen, you're here to recoup your loss? I'm here to pay my debt. Take it. Master Wan, where's my wife? Inside, waiting for you. I just paid you. How much? Ten taels. Have you lost your mind? You owe me fifty. No, ten. Damn it! Would I lie? Speak up! Fifty taels it is, please let her go. I'll after you've paid. I've a horse outside, that's my deposit. I'll come back with the money in three days. Sorry, I can't do that. Maybe we'll have a bet then. How much? -Fifty taels. Where's the money? Do you think I'm worth it? Very well! Deal. Move over... What's going on? Move aside... A pair. Heaven pair. I guess mine is pretty good. So? You win! Come on, bring Fugen's wife out. Yes. Thanks... Mother. I'm here to take you home. My good child, you're safe. Let's go home. Go! What are you waiting for? Go! Go! Bilian, are you badly injured? Save the act. Bilian. Bilian. Don't run. Come... Master Huang. Trouble? Yes, Luo Hongxun. Don't run. This way please... Go. Inn keeper. Master. Give us the best dishes, hurry! I'm in a rush. Right away. Master Luo, please save me. Huang Lun killed my dad, and kidnapped me. He said we owe him money. Go! I've heard about Huang Lun the Bully in our neighbourhood. Finally I've met you. You live up to your reputation indeed. Leave town within three days. Very well, I'll leave. I've an enemy. It's Luo Hongxun, he's just mentioned. I want him dead, for my scar. Don't worry, master. Luo Hongxun's lucky that he's not here. He wouldn't make it out alive. Let me think it over. My master has a small gift for you. Please accept it. No problem, I'll take care of it. Master. Why are you here? Another set please. Sit down, what happened? Nothing, the old lady is worried. She sent me here to accompany you to Yangzhou. Master, please. I've been dying for a drink. Don't get drunk. Don't worry, master. Bring us some more wine! Coming. Sir. My master has ordered me to invite you for an appointment at his residence. Who's your master? The Magistrate, Master Jin. I think you've got the wrong person. I've never met Magistrate Jin before. Are you Luo Hongxun? That's right. Then I've the right person. This way, please. Master, why are you going to the Magistrate's office? Tell him to come here instead. Do you think the Magistrate is a common man like us? Master Luo, do you agree? Wait for me here, I'll be back soon. Why bother? Please. Fine! I'll go with you. "Gaoyang Magistrate's Office" Please. Out! Master Luo, please. Robber! Why don't you kneel in front of me? Kneel. You tricked me into coming here to set me up? Nonsense. Why would I do that? I've never met you before. Then with no proof, why are you calling me a robber? Guards. -Here. Bring the prisoner Bai Huashe here. Bring Bai Huashe. Bring Bai Huashe. Go. Magistrate Jin. Is that your accomplice Luo Hongxun you mentioned? Take a good look. Don't get confused. Brother Luo, why would you get caught? You did it, Luo Hongxun! Admit to your crime. I've never met him before. You told the prisoner to say that. I'd rather die than admit to something that I didn't do. Punishment! -Yes. Out! What's taking my master so long? Who is it? Luo Hongxun. He's a robber, he's been locked up. Hurry. Master. Don't cry. I did you a favour by letting you here. Do you want me to get into trouble? Stop crying. Please have mercy. Let him go. Let him go? Yes, I'll replace him. Stop joking, just leave. Can I talk to him? If I let you, I'll be executed. Leave now! The guards are here. Help me! What did I do wrong? Why have you done this to me? Do you know how many of our men have been killed by Luo Hongxun and Hua Bilian because of you? You deserve it, Master Huang. Untie him. What are you doing here? Paying you a visit. Where's your master? Master. What happened? Tell me. The master has left to find Miss Hua. But he hasn't found her. Instead he got arrested in Gaoyang County. They're torturing him in jail. Why did you bring Miss Hua up? Your master is a heartless man, he almost got her killed. I beg you, please help to save Master Luo. Alright, please don't upset our master anymore. We'll think of something. Go in and rest. Hao Tianpeng. You son of a bitch! Who told you to speak? You're a mad dog! You bite like one! How dare you! Very well, I'll entertain you. Move over, I'll take care of him. What are you doing? Miss Hua. Tianpeng, why are you fighting him? This kid was rude to the master, and he's violent. Bullshit. You're not helping here. Enough. Yuqing, what are you doing here? My master is in trouble. I'm here to beg the old master to save him. Master got furious when he heard Luo Hongxun's name. And this kid is still here. Damn it! There you go again. Enough. Where's your master? In jail. Miss Hua, please save him. Miss Hua, you misunderstood Master Luo. I know the master really loves you. Enough with the sweet talk, do you think Miss Hua is a child? You should ask the right people for help. We're not qualified, please head back. Miss Hua. My master has always treated me well, I must do everything I can to help him. Tonight, I'll kill the useless magistrate and save the master. Please bless me, let it be a success! Miss Hua. Don't call me "Miss". Come on, show me to the jail. Certainly. Is there a good doctor here? Yes, very good, especially for treating the flu. Who? -Zhang Guoyang. (Chinese herbs) Dang Gui three qian, Shu Di Huang 3 qian, Bai Zhu 3 qian, Chuan Xiong 1.5 qian, Licorice 1 qian. Take this for a few days, and you'll recover. Thank you. Give me your hand. Doctor, I'm here for someone else. Where's the patient? In jail. If you could pay a visit there. You want me to pay a visit in jail? Yes, he's very ill. If you would please check on him. I might not agree even if the Magistrate sent a sedan chair to pick me up. It's out of the question, find someone else. Move over, don't be in anyone's way. You're really something. Getting the doctor to examine a patient in jail. Get up. What? Is your master having a grudge with Magistrate Jin? No. Why would he set him up? I suspect that it's the Little Bully's idea. Who's that? Huang Lun. Bravo. It's his turn next. Bravo. Bravo. You two are really good. With you here, I won't fear anyone. And for Luo Hongxun who's locked up, he wouldn't make it out alive. That's right. Who are you? Luo Hongxun's younger brother. Hey! What do you want to see my young master about? Sounds like you two are Huang Lun's bodyguards, is it? Yes, so? Huang Lun, Little Bully who would stop at nothing. I guess you know that. So what? Get out of the way! Or you're dead. Fifth Master, what's the point in talking? Show him some colours! Kill him! Chase! Head for sale. Head for sale? Head for sale. What a nerve! Head for sale. The bad guys would worry. The knife in the box can tell a good person from bad. The bad guys will be killed. Head for sale! Men. Check it out! And bring him in. -Yes. Head for sale. Hey, how much? Depends on who's buying. My master. Will you go with me? Wherever. Sure. Go in. The person who's selling heads. Kneel, you mad person. Kneel! -Don't move. Hey! If you're rude, then I'll turn you into this. Very well, I'll let you speak standing up. Two people were killed in the Huang residence yesterday, where's the other head? I handed it to Doctor Zhang Guoyang. What for? Haven't you heard? The doctor uses human heads for medicine. He's my old customer. Human head as medicine? Your old customer? What? Don't move. Grievance! Tell it to the judge. Grievance! Bilian is in jail. Old master, I'm here to greet you. Who said Bilian is in jail? Tell him. On the first day, I saw Miss Hua went to the doctor, but the doctor turned her down. Doctor? What for? Let him finish. The second day I saw Miss Hua selling a head on the street. Selling head? What? Fresh, just chopped-off head. And she went into the magistrate's office. And? I heard them say that Miss Hua murdered someone, to get them to lock up the doctor. So that he can cure the sick prisoner. Damn it! Who is she risking all that for? My master. Luo Hongxun? And what's the point in raising a daughter? When everyone refused her marriage proposals, and still...why is she doing that? Stop nagging. We must save her! Master, I'll go save her. I've been a recluse, but I must go out this time. The brat! Grievance! Go in. It's you. That's right. Sorry. Sorry about this. The head... Don't worry. I'll send you out when you've cured him. The patient? Please. Is that head real? Of course. Too cruel. He was a lackey of the Little Bully. What's wrong with him? Typhoid fever. Can you save him? Yes, but I worry about myself. He'll recover when he's taken my medicine. Bilian, it's you. You're really sick. Now that you're here, I'll be fine. Bilian, what are you doing here? Who's he? The doctor, you should thank him. Got it. You're such a good doctor. That's nice of you to come here. How should I thank you? There's no need, I think I must get going. Back to your home? To hell. You're Bilian? That sounds like a woman. She is. I'm impressed with you two. I'll go up and take a look. A secret weapon of the Bao Family's, who's up there? A young woman. Could it be Jinhua? Assassin. Go! Chase! Old hero, what are you doing here with your daughter in the middle of the night? And you? You're taking a stroll with your wife at this hour? Jinhua, is that yours? That was only a joke. Please forgive me, madam. Since when have you become the Magistrate's bodyguard? You shouldn't look down on me. Why are you pulling my leg? Alright, come to our house first. "Be benevolent and just" To be frank, the late father of Magistrate Jin saved my life before, that's why... Oh, so you're repaying your gratitude. You won't let me bother him. A sense of chivalry and honour, don't you agree? But you must be clear who you're helping. That's his problem. But I must repay my gratitude. What if he kills your daughter? Impossible. Is that so? Just pay him five hundred taels. Dad, I've heard about the bad deeds of Magistrate Jin. But it has nothing to do with me. I think you should forget about repaying him. I must, unless you kill me first. You want to risk our friendship for a corrupted official. If you force me along, then there's nothing I can do about it. Bao Zian, don't overestimate yourself. Don't think that you've a lot of manpower. You should know that no one messes with our Hua Family. Old madam, please don't be mad. Paying your gratitude. Do you think my daughter's life isn't important? Risking her life for a man like that! Nonsense. At your age that's not something you ought to say in front of your daughter. Have you gone crazy? Let's go! Don't bother with the nut. Let's do what we have to do. Old madam, let's work this out. Dad, if we save Bilian, then everyone would be happy. That's right. I don't want to kill anymore at my age. What do you think, Old Hero? Alright, you don't need to do a thing. Thanks. I'll come and thank you when my daughter is saved. Dad, are you confident in this? The prisoner is fine, sir. Please return to your room to rest. Good evening, Magistrate Jin. Old Bao? Yes, sir. You still recognise me? How did you get in? Don't worry, no one knows. Please have a seat. -Please. There were a few intruders here, did you know? Of course. If I didn't arrive in time, I'm afraid they might have killed you. I rushed here to save you, to repay what your late father did. But those who tried to kill you are my friends. I'm an official, aren't they worried to break the law? There're plenty of unresolved crimes. What do you suggest? Let Luo Hongxun and the one who sold heads go. That's not easy. You're worried about your bribes? Not easy to explain to my superiors. You won't get in trouble. How? Send the prisoners out of the county tomorrow morning. The minute they've stepped out of Gaoyang County, you're not responsible. Alright. And for those bribes you've received; take all that and help the poor. Oh, the money...I... You heard me? Yes. Here they are. Go! Run! Who killed my brothers Yao Wu and Gai Liu? Come out now! Or I'll make you into pate. Wait. Move over! No matter what reason you've got you're rude to barge into others' property. I won't let you get away with it. So you killed my brothers. Not me. Go! You seem to be ready for a revenge. But... But what? Could there be someone else who killed our brothers? Yes. Who are you? I own this place. Hua Bilian and Luo Hongxun killed your brothers. What? Hua Bilian and Luo Hongxun? Alright, let's go. Don't rush. -Master, you have a guest. You are... I've important news. It's regarding your safety. Are you interested to know? Tell us. These are... We are the Zhu Brothers. The Four Zhu Brothers of Four Greats Village. Welcome. This isn't the place to talk. Please come in. This way. "To Ji Nan" It's Kaifeng County behind that valley. We can strike there. Alright, we'll go that way. Sure. Spread over! How come they're not here yet? Dad, I'll go check it out. Me too. You two go ahead, don't get spotted. Yes. They went the wrong way? Can't be. Wait, why are you hitting her? Just a start, I'm going to kill her later. Can't do that. Master Huang, we had a deal. Hand her over. Hand her over? Forget it! She's going to die today. You burnt the bridges? Is that what a man would do? What about you? You used me to get rid of your enemy. Bullshit. Leave if you know what's best for you. Luo Hongxun. I'm here. Bilian. Are you alright, Bilian? Bilian. Master. Come on. Light the fire. Kill!
