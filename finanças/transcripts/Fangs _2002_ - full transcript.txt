(theme music playing ) ♪ I don't know nothin' 'bout chemistry ♪ ♪ Except the kind between you and me ♪ ♪ Oh, I do know that I love you, girl ♪ ♪ So take a trip and rock around the world. ♪ Okay, now here's the real creepy thing. They only eat this beef, and it has to be bloody. - Yuck. - I know. And if it isn't dripping in blood, then Professor Fuller's all, "There's not enough blood," and then I'm all, "Sorry." Gotcha. But I figure, if we're making seven bucks an hour, they can have dinner and a movie for all I care. Tell me about it. Does Professor Fuller get mad a lot? Only when the bats don't get fed. And when he gets mad, he gets mad in that weird-professor-in- his-sweater-genius kind of way. - That is so sexy. - Isn't it? ( electronic beeping ) Wow, it's creepy in here. What's with the lighting? Bats like to sleep in caves during the day, so this makes them feel right at home. Okay. They can't get out, can they? Nah, they're locked up nice and tight. I wouldn't want these freaky boys going anywhere. - You see this? - Uh-huh. It means they're hearing this sound that makes them all calm and blissful, Iike they're listening to an 'N Sync album, but only they can hear it. Now watch. When it's time for them to be fed, you push this. ( bats squealing ) Oh, wow. Now they're hearing another sound only they can hear. It tells them they're about to be fed. If you don't turn it on, the professor's all, "Why didn't you turn it on? " And then I'm all, "Sorry." Got it. Watch. Come on. Want it? Want it? They're so gross. ( screams ) Ahh! Get it off of me! Get it off! ( screaming ) I've never seen such a nervous cat, Dr. Winslow. It just breaks my heart to think of Dinah's suffering. Well, she doesn't look that nervous to me right now. No, no, she is. Just look at the tension. Why don't we bring her over here and I'll have a look at her? You know, I was holding her close and I could feel her little heart racing. Do you feel it? I'm trying. Can you help her, Doctor? Have you tried massage? No. Not too rough-- just enough to relieve the tension. - Ohh. - ( cat purring ) Ohh. ( laughs ) You see, she's starting to relax already. You have to touch with females, John. ( laughs ) Thanks. The Apple Blossom Dance is this weekend. Oh, I know. There'll be a lot of single women there. I'll be there, gettin' down... and gettin' funky. I'm not sure I'm quite ready for funky just yet. How long has it been? Almost three years since the funeral. Well, you can't live in Heartbreak Hotel forever, John. I'll try to remember that. It just jumped into my hair and attacked me. I was there, Professor Fuller-- I literally saw it happen. It bit me in the back of my head and it wouldn't stop bleeding. I used like, a half a box of Band-Aids. A completely natural reaction. The saliva of blood-feeding bats contains an anti-coagulant. - Anti-what? - Anti-coagulant. It prevents blood from clotting and closing up the wound. Yuck. They're very efficient little eating machines, when you stop and think about it. I don't want to think about it. Someone should do something. Perhaps if you kept your hair out of the cages in the future? No, I mean something more than that, Iike tell my parents or the Dean or something. Diane, have a seat. You're in my Biology 1 01 class, aren't you? Yeah. If we were to keep this among ourselves, without involving people on the outside, people who might not share our love of science, I would express my gratitude by making sure your final grade is an A. What about Heather? Her too. Deal! ( wings flutter ) ( wings flutter ) ( chimes ringing ) ( ringing ) What was Scottsville like before the invasion? What invasion? The invasion of the young, upwardly-mobile urban professional seeking a slice of the small town life! - That invasion. - You're not helping, Dad. Come on, I need something for my documentary. Genny, I'm your father, I'm not a sound-byte. Please, just tell me something about how Scottsville used to be, before I was born, back in the olden days. Let's see if I can remember back that far. Okay, the town moved slower. People took their time and everybody knew each other. Did the town have a mega-mart back then? No mega-marts, just regular sized ones. And when you went to the movies, they didn't have 21 screens, - just one. - One!? That's totally vintage. Did you have a TV back then? No, on Saturday nights, we used to sit around in loincloths, and beat big rocks with sticks. ( scoffs ) Man: Hey, Professor! - Oh, hello, Al. - Working late? It seems I get my best work done late at night. Just like your bats. Excuse me? You get your best work done at night just like your bats. Oh. ( chuckles ) ( squeaking ) - ( electronic beeping ) - ( lock clicks ) ( bats squeaking ) ( whistling ) ( distant yell ) So nice of you to stop by, Logan. ( muffled ) Thank you, Mr. W. But maybe your parents would enjoy your company this evening. No way. They hate having me around. - How would you know? - They said. "Logan, we hate having you around." Oh, I'm sure they didn't mean that in a negative way. - Genny: All set. - Tell him what you're gonna call it. You're gonna love this. "Scottsville, Town without Pity." I love it! Channel 1 2 is going to run it, definitely. "Look up the words, 'perfect small town' in the dictionary, and you'll probably find a picture of Scottsville there. For years, this small, uncomplicated town was the perfect place to live, work, and raise your family. Then suddenly, catastrophe struck. Serenity was replaced with urban blight-- superstores, strip malls, junk housing. All thanks to a man named Carl Hart." - Honey, we could get sued. - Shhh. "Hart gets property by foreclosing on small family-owned farms, and it's all handled through his finance company. Is it legal? - Maybe it is on paper--" - We're definitely gonna get sued. Daddy, I verified all of my facts. "Unsuspecting buyers from the city plunk down their hard-earned cash, and wind up with yuck for their buck." I wrote that! "Modern suburban blight at its max. And it's all been brought to you by-- Carl Hart, the Duke of Doom." The Duke of Doom?! I only wrote the first half of that. Genny: "And whenever things get too messy for Hart to handle, he calls on his one-man, personal police force..." Get that camera out of my face! Gimme it! Gimme it! I'm gonna break it! Get back here! ( giggling ) "... a low rent, rent-a-cop, Louis the enforcer." - Now wait just a minute! - Shhh! Genny: "What have we lost? Oh, not much. Just our way of life. Before Hart..." People took their time and everybody knew each other. I ended it with you, Daddy. Oh, great! I'm on camera. Why don't we call your grandma and ask her if she's got something to say. Then we can all be named in the lawsuit. Heather: He must have asked me to the Apple Blossom Dance a dozen times. And I was all, "Which part of no don't you understand? " Diane: What'd he do? He started dancing around, showing me his cool moves, so I'd be all, "I've got to go to the dance with Mr. Smooth." Gross. He was wearing sandals with socks. - Eww. - Sad. ( screaming ) - ( police radio chatter ) - Howard, you're a professional. You're supposed to be used to this kind of thing. But, Ally, it's just that-- I've never seen a dead person before. Not even at a funeral. When my grandmother died, I was 1 2. I didn't go to the wake. I stayed home. My mother was furious, but I told her, "I don't care. You can punish me all you want to. I'm not going to Nana's funeral." That's what we called her. Howard, why don't you wait in the patrol car, and see if Chief Taylor radios in? Really? Can I? Whew! Yeah. That'd be, um... Yeah, yeah, I'll do that. And if anything comes in, I'll... I'll find someone to tell you. Whoo. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Hello, I'm Detective Parks. Are you the two lab assistants who discovered the body? Yes, we were going to feed the bats, and-- I'm in training. And we found Professor Fuller just like this. When's the last time you saw the professor? Yesterday, when he yelled at me. I need you to stick around. I want to talk to each of you separately. Okay? - Okay. - Okay. I need a list of everybody who was here last night. - I'd like to take a look. - Heather: Don't! What happened to him, it's gross. - It's horrible! - Thanks, ladies, but I worked homicide in Los Angeles for nine years. Trust me, I've seen everything. Whoa! Do you think we still get our A's? - Hi! - Oooh! Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. - Are you Detective Parks? - Yes. I'm John Winslow. I'm the town's animal control officer. Well, actually I'm a veterinarian, but the animal control thing is just part-time. You know, until they can find someone else who's willing to do the job. Henry-- Henry Banks used to do the job before me, and he answered a complaint about a boa constrictor in some woman's basement-- Well, I guess he and the woman hit it off together. They ran off to Mexico. No one knows what happened to the boa constrictor. Is there any particular reason why you're here? Uh, bats. Professor Fuller had hundreds of them. And if they had rabies or any other disease, then it's a case for animal control. - Is this where they were kept? - ( sputtering ) Can you not touch that? This is a crime scene. Oh. And you think maybe the victim was killed by that door? There could be fingerprints. Can you really get a fingerprint off a bar that small? We'll never know, will we, now that you've touched it? Did you come down here to see about missing bats, or to get your greasy fingerprints all over potential evidence? I think you might have your dates mixed up. Mean and Angry Day is tomorrow. Today is Be Nice To The Animal Control Guy Day. Everyone knows that Fuller was doing bat research. He had over 500 of them, and now they're gone. And I've got to look into it. It's my job. I'm also here to do my job, which is slightly more relevant than being the town dogcatcher. - Dogcatcher?! - Look, Fuller is dead, and someone let all his bats out. What this case needs is a criminologist, someone who is trained in homicide and accident investigation, someone who is not going to contaminate the evidence, - with-- whatever. - Fine. I'll just go then. - That would be better. - I'll come back and do my job - after you've finished your job. - Good, yes, thanks. Goodbye. I'll try not to touch anything on the way out. Certainly wouldn't want to contaminate the crime scene. Not any more than you already have. Are you sure you don't need any help? I can manage. ( rustling ) ( wings flapping ) ( rustling ) Oh! Ohh. - Howard, you scared me to death. - Sorry. How was it? Was it gory? You know what? Don't tell me. I don't want to know. Good, because after spending all day in there, I don't really want to tell you. How'd he die? It was an accident, wasn't it? I don't think so. The body was so badly mutilated you couldn't see his face. Accident victims don't look like that. I-- Fuller was murdered. Weird. I wonder where those bats went. ( squeaking ) Oh, it looks like Mr. Hart. ( dog barking ) - Stop him! - I'm trying, sir. Omar, shut up. Shut up! What's wrong with this dog? I don't get it. He only acts this way with you. Tell him to bark at the vandals who damage my homes, not the guy who signs your paycheck. Maybe he's seen what you pay me. ( laughs ) Sorry. Bad dog, Omar. - ( dog whines ) - Stupid mutt. Look, Louis, I got a truck coming with a couple thousand sheets of drywall, 6:00 a.m., tomorrow morning. If they're late, - I need you to be here. - Will do. Whoever signs for them, I want to count each and every sheet. 2,000 sheets of drywall?! You better believe I will. ( laughs ) I never built this many homes in one development. And they're beauties. Real beauties-- especially that three-bedroom Key Largo model. Now, that's a real honey. Enjoy it now, because you're never going to live in one. Listen, Willy Kramer's supposed to vacate his farm sometime soon. He may need a little bit of, uh... persuasion. - Louis: That's my specialty. - ( cell phone rings ) Hold on. Hello? What?! "Police Seek Clues in Professor's Murder" They can't print that! It's the Apple Festival this week. I got 1 00 home buyers coming to town, for-- If that thing hits the stands, I-- Just don't move! Don't move, I'll be there. - ( phone beeps ) - I gotta go. Is there anything I could do for you, Mr. Hart? Yeah, try buying every copy of tomorrow's "Scottsville Journal." It'll take a lot of quarters, but-- - ( dog whines ) - I know. He's a jerk. ( thud ) You hear that? Me too. ( wood creaking ) ( thuds ) ( squeaking ) Who's in there?! ( squealing ) Hart: I can't believe that thing almost hit the stands. If I had gotten there five minutes later, I would have been a dead man. How'd you get the newspaper to stop the presses? I threatened to pull my advertising. I'll bet that got their attention. ( chuckling ) It's not funny! It's Apple Festival week, the Apple Blossom Dance is Friday. My daughter is going to be crowned Miss Apple Blossom. How do you know she's going to win? Because I'm making you the judge. You listen to me, Sam, if people thought there was some sort of killer loose in this town, I couldn't give my homes away. And I can't go running down to the newspaper every time they're thinking about running a headline that can ruin me! Yeah, I know. I know. I don't want to know what happened to this clown Fuller, I don't care! I just want this investigation stopped! Or would you rather not get paid your cut? I'll take care of the problem. I promise. I'm gonna take a nap. ( whimpers ) No, you don't get to nap. You stay awake and watch these houses. ( squealing ) ( whines ) ( snoring ) ( chattering ) ( dog yowls ) ( growling ) ( whimpering ) I got one more problem that needs to be taken care of. I want you to evict Willy Kramer from his farm tomorrow night. Kramer? No, he's still got 30 days. I got his contract here somewhere. He doesn't become delinquent until the 23rd of next month. Forget that-- I've got an amendment to the contract with an eviction date as of... tomorrow. You got a judge to change the date? No. I got an inkjet printer to change the date. - ( laughs ) - You what? - You can't-- - Don't tell me what I can't do! I got more than 30 home sales pending, and every contract's got a clause promising a golf course. Kramer's farm is that golf course. The entire new development goes bust unless I can deliver on this. Louis: You're not going to charge me for this, are ya, Doc? - No. - Good, 'cause I'm not some doctor that makes a gazillion bucks a week, like you. I'm just an honest working man. That's why I'm not charging you for it. See, I really didn't know what to do, and someone at work said this was something for animal control. No, you did the right thing. So you say Omar was killed by bats? Hundreds of 'em. Maybe even thousands. How is it that you weren't attacked? I was asleep in my truck. So how'd you see the bats? I woke up! Listen, Doc, are you gonna give me the third degree or are you gonna look at the dog? I-- uh-- I'm gonna look at the dog. Definitely look at the dog. Let's just see here. I got to warn you, Doc, these bats, they really went to town on Omar. What they left, it ain't pretty. - Wow! - Told ya! Okay, look, I'm gonna have to do a few tests. Can you leave him here for a couple of days? You can keep him forever. He won't do me no good dead! No, I guess not. Must be kind of upset about losing Omar. Yeah, I'm upset. Now I gotta go buy me another dog. - Right. - ( door shuts ) - ( knocking ) - Come in. You wanted to see me, Chief? Yeah. I was going through my paperwork and I can't seem to find your report on the Fuller case. That's because it's not finished-- - not yet anyway. - Problem? No, I'm just waiting for the coroner's report. The coroner's report? ( chuckles ) And... what's it gonna say? No, no, I'll tell you what it's gonna say. Fuller was a kook. One night, his bats decided to take a hike, He got upset, had a heart attack and died. Death by natural causes. Case closed. Actually, no. The "natural causes" thing isn't going to fly. I see. So in addition to being a big time homicide detective from big time Los Angeles, now you're a mind-reader too? This isn't just a hunch, sir, the body was badly mutilated. This was a murder. Did you recover a murder weapon? - No, but I'm-- - How about a witness? Sometimes it helps to have a witness, you have one? - Not yet-- - A suspect, that'd be nice. You have a suspect? It could have been animal rights' activists, it could have been the two girls who discovered the body, One of the two girls who discovered the body? What were their names? Muffin and Bambi-- - Heather and Diane. - Heather and Diane. Now there's the names of two lifelong violent felons. The deadly duo of Heather and Diane. I suppose you discovered the girls' motives? Motive, as in, a reason they felt it was necessary to kill somebody. What did Fuller do? Break their hairdryer? Steal their bellybutton rings? - Sir, if you just let me-- - You know, Parks, Scottsville isn't anything like Los Angeles. Scottsville is different. Way different. Our local businesses are run by families. Those families count on the money the Apple Festival brings in. So the last thing this town needs right now is a murder! So I want your report on how Fuller died a peaceful, and natural death on my desk tomorrow morning! - Sir, that would-- - Tomorrow! Yes, sir. How long does it take to get an autopsy in this county? - Man: Seven days. - I'm aware of that. But I need this information stat. - What? - That's what doctors say when they need something fast. Don't you watch TV?! - Nope. - Uh-huh. Okay, what about the blood work, then? - State capitol. - You sent it where? - Sacramento. - By mail? - Nah, pony express. - Do you know-- - Can you hold? - Okay, I'll hold. ( phone rings ) - Parks. - Hi, this is John Winslow. - I'm sorry, who? - Winslow, Dr. John Winslow. The veterinarian-- we met yesterday. - Oh, the dogcatcher. - Yeah, the dogcatcher. I also entertain at children's birthday parties. Listen, a client of mine just brought in his dog-- You know what, I don't have time for a dog story right now. I'm in the middle of a very important homicide investigation. Okay, you had the roast beef with mayo and a diet Coke, right, Ally? This dog is dead. He was attacked by bats. This could have something to do with your investigation. Did you tamper with the evidence? Did I run my hands all over a chewed up doberman? No. Don't touch anything. I'll be right there. ( chuckles ) Howard? I'm gonna go see Dr. Winslow. I've got the coroner on line one. Tell him I need those blood results yesterday. Gotcha. Hey, what about your lunch? I'm not hungry. Can I have it? Sure. I've been looking through some of my books, and most bats attack in areas where it's easiest to draw blood. They go for the ankles and the neck. Yeah? But these bats didn't just take blood. They took flesh. I can see that. They ate this dog like he was dinner. This is just like Professor Fuller-- Exactly. Here's something else that's really weird. Listen to this. When a bat bites it's host-- yeah, like you invited them-- their saliva contains small amounts of procaine hydrochloride. - What's that? - Well, it numbs the pain. The host puts up less of a fight. But these bats, the ones who killed Omar-- I took some tissue samples and ran some tests. Their saliva contained 20 times the regular amount of procaine hydrochloride. What does that mean? It means the more they attack, the less you feel. So what causes a bat to turn killer like that? I don't know. A disease, or some kind of genetic engineering. Okay, wait. You want me to go into my boss' office and tell him that these deaths were caused by mutant killer bats? Yep. I don't think so. I need proof. I need a bat. I need to connect the fangs with the bite marks. Ah, so now you want the dogcatcher's help. I mean, I figured you'd like to help and thought I'd just give you a break here. Gee, thanks. So? Come on, what do we do? Well, bats love caves. There's only one in the area. Great. When do we go? It's probably safest during the day when they're asleep. Right, we don't want to wake any of them up. No, we don't. And I have some cave exploring equipment. This is your cave exploring equipment? What? You can do better? I guess not. Why do we have to wear this stuff, anyway? Protection. Okay. How'd you find this place? Teenagers come up here and make out at night. And you know this because? Because I caught my daughter up here with her boyfriend one night. - What about you? - What about me? You done any parking at the bat cave lately? Not since I left LA. Left your boyfriend behind? Ex-boyfriend. He moved in with another woman. Ooh, boy. When they move in with someone else that's a pretty good sign that your relationship might be in trouble. Oh, man, I cannot believe I have to wear all this stuff. I must look ridiculous. It's not a fashion show. You're out here in the middle of nowhere. No one's gonna see you. Are you afraid that someone's gonna laugh at you? All right, you're right. ( laughs ) What? You look ridiculous. - John? - Yeah? - Maybe I should tell you. - What? I have this thing about bats. I'm not afraid of felons with guns... but bats just give me the creeps. Well, news flash. Duh. Bats give everyone the creeps. No, I take that back. I saw this guy on the Discovery Channel once, who put this bat right here-- John. Okay. All right. Watch your head. Oww! What are we looking for? Bat droppings. ( screaming ) - ( laughs maniacally ) - ( screams ) It's okay. It's okay. It's just there was this big spider in this icky web, and I-- Settle down. You're all right. You're all right. Let's just keep going. Come on. Come on. You're all right. What do bat droppings look like? You know what cow droppings look like, right? Yes. Bat droppings are the same, only smaller. Cute. That's real cute. ( bats squealing ) Sounds like they're overhead. They could be. This is as far as you can go. We don't find them here, we won't find them anywhere. Oh, darn. What's wrong with the light? I don't know. Can you fix it? Probably just needs a good whack. The only thing that scares me more than bats is the dark. - I wish you hadn't done that. - Why? ( bats squealing ) ( screaming ) Why did they do that? The flare. They were trying to get away from the light. I think they were fruit bats, just normal everyday fruit bats. Not the kind we're looking for. How can you be sure? Because we're not dead and bloody. Oh, good, that makes me feel so much better. Genny: One professor, one ferocious guard dog-- both dead. A coincidence? I think not. The number one suspect? Bats. Violent, aggressive, flesh-eating, blood-sucking bats! I'm sorry, miss, you can't tape this. Is it an official crime scene? No. I look ridiculous. We're here with John Winslow, former small town vet-turned-bat-hunter. What's going on here, sir? - Am I in focus? - Yep. - The light's good? - I think so. Framed up nice and tight? Uh-huh. If you don't turn that camera off right now, you're grounded until you're 40. ( beeps off ) ( car alarm beeps ) - Does Kramer know you're here? - Not a clue, boss. Okay. Are we ready? As ready as we're ever gonna be. We were waiting for you, Mr. Hart. All right. Let's go. This property is in the middle of my golf course. I promised my home buyers a golf course, and this house is in the middle of the seventh fairway. Shut up! Sam, how are we doing on this so-called murder investigation? - It's all under control. - It better be. I expect to close most of my deals at the dance on Friday night. Yeah I hear you daughter's gonna be Miss Apple Queen. Miss Apple Blossom. And yes, that is the icing on the cake. Your job, besides, mmm... is to make sure that nobody touches my icing. Is that clear? No touching of the icing. It's taken care of. All right. Let's go. You let me talk to Willy. He's owned this farm forever. All right, all right, I'm coming. Hello, Chief. What's wrong? I'm sorry, Willy. There's no easy way to say this. It's after midnight and you should be off the property by now. - This is my land. - So beat it, ol' man! What are you talking about? My contract says I got 30 days. That's enough time for me to bring in my apple crop, and make the payment. That contract was subject to the terms and conditions of the amendment. - What amendment? - This one. You see this here? We both initialed it. - Those aren't my initials. - Yes, they are. What, are you trying to cheat Mr. Hart? This says that you had until midnight tonight to vacate. You're not gonna make me pack up my stuff and leave in the middle of the night, are ya? ( grunts ) You didn't have to come out here in the middle of the night. That's okay. Julia Roberts canceled our date, anyway. That's funny. I have to solve this by tomorrow so I do appreciate it. Well, at least it beats vaccinating a pit bull. - Well, I'm glad of one thing. - What's that? - Those bats haven't come back. - Yeah. Over here-- Fuller's desk. Okay, boss, all their junk's in the back. See that tree over there? I can remember the day my father planted it. I was five. When it got big enough he put a tire swing on it for me and my sister. He took care of that tree until the day he died. That's a really sweet story. Don't hit the mailbox on the way out. ( bats squealing ) Yuck. No kidding. Disgusting. This guy sure was into bats. It's almost like an obsession. I know. He was them all labeled too. Red bat, Southern yellow, Mexican free tail, vampire bat. What's this? ( Ally groans ) If Kramer comes back, I want you to handcuff him to a fencepost and call Chief Taylor. With pleasure. You know, I've been driving past this farm since I was a kid. Yeah? Take a good look. Two days from now it won't be here. Get off my car. ( squealing ) ( screaming ) This is just weird. He has notes not only on bats, but on sea snakes and leeches and-- Things that suck blood for 500, Alex. I wonder what's in here. Yuck. - Ahh. - Oh, boy. Both: Ahh! Could we please not open any more drawers? Wait a second. Bingo! Morning, Howard. They don't pay me nearly enough, - not for this. - Will you be okay? I don't know. Two dead bodies in one week. It's ridiculous. Scottsville hasn't seen a crime spree this bad since those kids siphoned the Big Gulp machine at 7-1 1. - Is Ally here? - Over there, Iooking at Louis, or what's left of him. You take it easy. We'll have to stop meeting like this. - Louis. - Yeah, I heard. - Just like the first? - Worse. Nah, come on. Nothing could be worse-- okay, it's worse. What was Louis doing here? This is Willy Kramer's farm. Not since midnight last night. It now belongs to the king of: "no money down and easy monthly payments." My guess is Louis was attacked after Hart and Taylor left. Any luck with that computer you found? Not exactly. I know it's Professor Fuller's, but I need his password. - Did you try his birthday? - First thing I tried. - What about his social security number? - Second thing. - What else do you have? - Not much... except the victim managed to take a couple of them with him. Courtesy of Professor Fuller. - John: How do you know? - Bands on their legs. I want a bat. Can I have a bat? Please? Please, can I have a bat? - John: Hmm. - What's the matter? Guess how big an average bat's fangs are, in millimeters. - A hundred millimeters. - Come on. A bat would look like a walrus if they were that large. You guessed too high. You ruined what I was going to say. You should guess small, and then when I tell you, you're surprised. Ah-ha, I see. Let me guess again. Fangs on a bat. One millimeter. Wrong. Three. That's so much bigger than I would have guessed. Now guess how big the fangs are on the bats Fuller bred. - Two millimeters. - No. Six. They're twice as long. Somehow, Fuller managed to genetically engineer these bats to be more aggressive and to have longer fangs. There are 500 killers on the loose and the Apple Blossom Dance is tonight. - John: Where are you going? - Go see Chief Taylor. We need a dusk till dawn curfew. Nobody in this town is safe. I've got to go shut down the dance. ( John screams ) Murray! Come on. Yeah! Yeah. Taylor: Cancel the dance, shut down the Apple Festival, impose a curfew. Are you insane? You haven't seen the bodies. Look at these pictures. Those people died horrible, violent deaths. Have you personally seen an attack? No. Then stop, until you have proof. I have proof. I examined a bat that killed Louis. If somebody dies tonight at the dance, the blood is on your hands. Because of some little micies - with wings flying around? - Yes! Because of that, you want me to tell people, "Lock yourselves up at home and stay there"? Now you listen to me. I told you there are too many little people in this town that depend on this time of year. So if I catch you at the dance, saying anything to anybody, or trying to cause trouble, you can just hand me your badge. As of right now, this investigation is over. Pack up everything and send it to storage. - But Chief-- - Do it! This town has too many little people. - You heard. - Everybody heard. - He's so full of it. - What do you mean? The chief doesn't care about the little people in this town. But Hart sells most of his homes to out-of-towners. And most of them get their first taste of Scottsville at the Apple Festival. - The Chief's in for a cut. - He's what? He's on Hart's payroll. He won't shut down the festival. He'd lose too much money. You'd have a better chance to ask the Pope to cancel Christmas. And by the way, you didn't hear it from me. Maybe the bats won't attack tonight. John: I doubt that. They've attacked every night so far. Then, we'd better get to the dance before dark. Yeah, uh... this doesn't mean I'll actually have to dance, does it? You'll have to dance with somebody, or you'll look out of place. It's been a long time since I've been on a dance-floor. Let me refresh your memory. - Come here. - What, right here? Stand right there. This hand goes here. - That hand goes up in the air-- - Yeah, I know. I know. I'm not a cactus. You can get closer. - You're not a cactus. - Not a cactus. So, you just sort of move your feet... and follow me, and you're dancing. I'm dancing. Whoa, Mr. W. - You move fast. - We were actually... comparing arm lengths. - Logan almost got a speeding ticket. - John: What? I would have, but I had too many soda cans on my dash. - You're lucky you only got a warning. - I don't understand. Soda cans? The aluminum messed up the police radar. How many aluminum cans do we have in the recycling bin? Bunches. Why? I know. I could fill my van with them, - so we don't get a ticket tonight. - John: That's not what I mean. What I'm saying is if we cut the cans up in little pieces, we might be able to interfere with the bats' radar. - I can't wait to catch that on tape. - You'll be waiting a long time, - 'cause you're not going to the dance. - But, Daddy-- John: Honey, three people have died. - You won't be the fourth. - But this is the biggest story ever. That's it. You are staying here. And I can't believe I'm saying this. I want Logan to stay with you. - Dad. - Oh. Woman: I haven't been to anything like this in years. Man: Can't do much dancing in these shoes. Woman #2: You'll love this place. I got apple butter and apple jelly. What an incredible town. I bought a hand-made quilt, only $800. You should see the new house we just picked. Parks. Did I not make myself clear earlier? No, sir, you did. - I just thought-- - You thought what? That you'd warn people they can be eaten alive, maybe shut down the dance? I told you what I'd do - if I you tried to make trouble. - John: Honey, I'm sorry I'm late. I was wondering where you were. Hit some traffic. Couldn't be helped. What? - You look terrific. - Really? Yeah. You don't look like a cop. Where did you hide your gun? Wouldn't you like to know? Yeah. Is there something I can help you with, Chief? Well, I-- I didn't know that you-- Councilman Woods! Excuse me. Thanks. You're welcome. He would have fired me. Yeah, I know. It was quick thinking. Well... anything to save your job. Anything? I didn't want you to get fired. So you... forced yourself to kiss me? Umm... - somebody had to. - Somebody had-- well, thanks for being so brave. What are you getting all bent out of shape for? Nothing. Oh boy. ( rock music playing ) Hart: Ladies and gentlemen, a Hart home is a home for keeps. We use only the highest quality construction material. I promise you, I defy you to find a more beautiful house at this price, anywhere. - And it's on a golf course. - Not just a golf course. It's got a 6,800-yard championship golf course. And this town is safe to live in? Safe? As long as Chief Taylor isn't hitting from the 1 6th tee, - you'll be just fine. - ( all laugh ) Please, everybody, come around. - Who would have thought? - Howard Spiegel, king of swing. Should we dance? No. From the dance-floor, we could keep our eyes on the windows and doors at the same time. Okay. Remember to keep an eye out for my dad. Logan: Right. Let's go up here. - Genny: Great view. - Logan: Excellent. - Where's my camera? - Here. All the windows are secured. Doors are all shut. What am I missing? Did you see anything outside that looked dangerous? - I looked for bats. - And? - I didn't see any. - Maybe we worried for nothing. John: Maybe. You know, if I could get a bat attack on tape, I bet I could sell it to Nova... or National Geographic. Or America's Funniest Pets. - Are you sure we're safe up here? - Couldn't be any safer. And this is a family town? Are you kidding? It's country living that brought me so close to my daughter here. Daddy, you're wrinkling my charmeuse. Apple of my eye. Look... I'm sorry about that remark I made outside, about kissing you just to save your job. I kind of liked it. Kind of? Umm... actually, I really liked it. it's just been a long time since I put my lips on someone else's. How long? Not since I gave a collie mouth-to-mouth. Well, if it's not Mr. I'm-Not-Ready-To-Date-Yet. Hmm? - Who was that? - I massaged her cat once. Look at them. Logan: They're acting like they're having a good time or something. Genny: Don't they know how ridiculous they look? My grandfather does this sometimes. He goes out and acts like a regular person. How come? Usually, it's because he forgot his medication. ( drum roll ) As you all know, it's time to crown this year's Miss Apple Blossom. You know, I'm a lucky man. I have a beautiful daughter and a lovely family, good health, and it's all because I live in a town like Scottsville, where there's no stress, and oodles of clean air and water. I invite each and everyone of you to visit me at the Hart Homes booth. Remember my motto, "Hart is where the home is." Even if you have bad credit, I want-- okay, all right, Miss Apple Blossom. It's time to crown this year's winner, and I am proud to tell you... it's my daughter, Alexis. - ( crowd sighs ) - The judges have good taste. ( laughter ) Alexis Hart, I hereby crown you... Scottsville's own... Miss Apple Blossom. ( crowd claps ) Ain't she pretty? Wow, me? I can't believe it. This is the happiest moment of my life. Alexis: I want to thank my daddy, and Chief Taylor, my dermatologist, and my cosmetic surgeon-- ( screeching ) This is Genny Winslow, reporting from Scottsville. This is a bat attack we're witnessing! John: The lights! - They're not working. - Maybe it's the wrong switch. - We have to act fast. - Plan B. Everything is under control. Calm down. - Shoo! Get out of here! - Oh my God! Let me get you to the car. I want-- Slow it down, people. Don't panic. Slow it down. Just relax. - ( screeching ) - Genny: The light. - Logan: What? - The spotlight. Oh yeah. - Let's do it. - You think it'll work? I hope so. - Logan, this is so awesome. - Come on, get some. Want some light? Don't mess with the man. It's working. Yes! I like Plan B. - Man: Come on! Run! - ( screaming ) Miss Smith, you wanted a place near the school. Aren't you the schoolteacher? You two. - Come here. Come on. - Hart, tear up my check. But you signed a contract. Buyer's Remorse. We've got 72 hours to change our minds. - It's state law. - I'll sue. - Woman: Just try. - We're both lawyers. - Sam. - I've never seen anything like this. Everybody wants their money back. I'm ruined! I'll think of something. - Like what? - I don't know... This bat thing happens once every 1 000 years... - the position of the moon. - The moon? You'd better do better than that. Every cent I own's tied up in this new development. If it goes bust, so do I! And so do you. The moon? Sir! The place-- I'll give you the pool for free. Oh. That aluminum can thing was brilliant. Yes, I know. Screwed up the bats' radar. They couldn't see where they were going. - It was great! - Ow! Sit still. Why didn't the bats attack you? Because I'm wearing aluminum underwear. - I'd like to see that. - I bet you would. Ow! Doctors make the worst patients. I'm saying ow so you'll think I'm weak and helpless. I already think that. What about handsome and sexy? Um... I'm still stuck on weak and helpless. But you're missing handsome and sexy. What exactly am I missing? This. Genny: How was the dance? It was like Pearl Harbor with music. - Logan: Huh? - The bats showed up, but the aluminum can thing worked great. I'm just glad you listened to me and stayed home. I'm glad we did too. - Sounds scary. - What's really scary is if these bats are allowed to mix with the local bat population, it'll make the problem 1 00 times worse. I am not living in an aluminum foil house. I was looking through some of the footage I didn't use in my documentary, - and I found these street signs. - Street signs? Apparently, whenever Hart bulldozes another farm, he names the street after the former owner. Look. Miller Lane. John: I remember the Millers. Demarco Terrace. Genny: Fuller Place. George Fuller. I remember him. He was a sweet old guy. What? Didn't all this start when Arthur Fuller died? Did George Fuller have any family? - Genny? - I don't know. We have to crack Arthur Fuller's laptop and get to his files. Logan, John says you're a computer whiz. - So, it's time to prove it. - Can we download some MP3s first? Logan, no. Aw... all right. ( screeching ) Morning, Logan. - Logan. - I finished painting the driveway, Dad. It's me, John. Oh, hi, Mr. C. - It's Mr. W. - Oh yeah, right. Any luck breaking into Fuller's files? No, sorry. I tried every password, decryption schemes, websites... Thanks for trying. - There's good news, though. - What's that? I found out I'm related to one of the Three Stooges. Well, you must be very proud. Yeah. Taylor? Yeah. I saw an ambulance outside. Is he still alive? Not quite. - Then why the ambulance? - That's for Howard. He discovered the body. Don't go in there. I've never seen anything like it. Can I get a pillow? He'll live. - What's that? - I don't know. - We found it near the body. - Some kind of police equipment? Nothing I've ever seen before. Have you noticed something? With the exception of Professor Fuller, all of these attacks seem to be connected to Karl Hart. You're right. Hey. I hear that Sam Taylor was killed last night. - Is this true? - I'm afraid so. Good grief. Right here, in police headquarters. Hart: What is going on with this town? It'd be easier to sell real estate that was on fire. I've got a mob standing outside my office. They're demanding their money back. Plus your best friend was killed last night. Oh yeah. Yes, there is that. - Are you the chief of police now? - Yes, I am, till the City Council appoints someone else. I want an end to this. Do you understand? Whatever's going on, I want it to stop. Pronto! Today! I want you to get to the bottom of it, and I want it to just stop! Hart: This is ridiculous. I think he's taking it pretty well. Genny: Right. Got it. ( computer beeps ) Computer voice: Welcome back, Professor Fuller. Yes! I'm in! - That's great! - Not really. I have no idea what I'm looking at. Genny: Ah-ha. Right. Okay. Thank you very much. Bye. - Logan cracked the code. - What have you got? We don't know. Looks like Fuller had a special file on audio research. - But that wasn't his field. - Yeah, but it makes sense. The lab assistants said they had to activate some high-frequency audio device when they fed the bats. Well, I'm no expert, but my guess is that most of the time, this little baby plays the bats' favorite tune. But when it plays their dinnertime tune, you're history. Which means that it wasn't an accident, or some freak of nature. Taylor was targeted. And Louis. But what about Fuller? Genny: I just spoke to the County Clerk at the Hall of Records. One of the first farms that Carl Hart foreclosed on was owned by George Fuller... father of Arthur Fuller. It would make sense he'd be the one to start all this. - But he's dead. - And Hart is next. No, Monday's too late. Woman on speaker: But we're not open weekends. I don't care. Get them to open it on Sunday! - This is a medical emergency. - Miss, I'm sorry-- Hold on, let me get rid of this other call. - Hart Homes. - Ally: Is Mr. Hart there? He's not here right now. Bye-bye. - Ally: Wait. Is this Alexis? - Yes. Ally: This is Detective Parks. - Can you tell me where he is? - I don't know where he is. Even if I did, he told me not to tell anyone. Ally: Listen to me. These bat attacks-- I have reason to believe your father might be next. He's in extreme danger. Do you know where he might be? No, but he got a call 20 minutes ago. Someone offered to buy him out at twice what he paid. - Ally: Did you happen-- - Thank you for calling Hart Homes. - Okay, I'm back. - Receptionist: As I was saying, the doctor does not perform cosmetic surgery on Sundays. You're not getting it. I have a supermarket opening on Monday. Alexis said that someone offered to buy out her father - at twice what he paid. - Genny: Sounds like a setup to me. Yeah, could be. But if this person wants the bats to attack Hart, they'll need another homing device. - Yeah? - So, if we can build a device that detects high-frequency sound waves... Then we could triangulate the location and find out who's behind this. - Is that possible? - I don't know. Logan, can you build a device like that? A device that detects ultra-high-frequency audio? No way. They sell them at Radio Hut for 30 bucks, though. Ally: I'll try scanning north-northwest. Anything? Nothing. But then again, I don't know what I'm looking for. Any signal over 20 kilohertz, outside the range of human hearing. And it'll be a steady tone. - ( steady buzz ) - Hold on. What do you think? Yeah, could be. Give the frequency to Logan. Logan, we're getting a tone at 23-950. Copy that, two-three-niner-fiver. Genny: Hold on. Yes, there it is. Heading at... 5-6-4. We got it at fiver-sixer... four-er? - Where is it coming from? - Ally: I don't know yet. On this map, Route 6, looks like. That's the Kramer farm. Logan, on speaker: Did you find the location? - Yeah-- - Wait a minute. Yeah, but you kids have to promise not to go there. We won't. John, on speaker: The audio tone is coming from Hickory Lake, the south shore. Okay. We won't go there. - Over and out. - John: Over and out. That's not the location. I know. But tell them not to go there, and that's where they'll go for sure. You're a genius. That's what I've been trying to tell you. The lake isn't in line with our coordinates. It's nowhere near them. Well, what else is? A Dairy Queen... a mountain... and the Kramer farm. Both: The Kramer farm! ( screeching ) Fuller: Don't worry. They won't hurt you. Not yet. My babies won't do a thing... till they're told. And they never let me down. Ally: So you have the coroner's report? What does it say? The dental records of Arthur Fuller don't match the body. The victim was someone named Sheldon Broydo? Okay, Howard, listen. Get into evidence lockup. But it's locked. That's why they call it an evidence lockup. - You're the only one with a key. - Ally: Break the lock. - And who will pay for that? - I will. All right? Do you remember last year we seized explosives - from that truck on the interstate? - Uh-huh. I need you to get a few pounds of C-4 and a timer, and meet us at the Kramer farm. This doesn't involve seeing dead people, does it? Let me talk to him. Howard, it's John. We might have these bats cornered. And if we do, we need something to make sure they will never attack again, okay? Okay, all right, I'll be there. Ally: That's it, up ahead. Cut the engine. Kill the lights too. This isn't the first time we've met in a barn. After you ruined my father, he went in his barn and killed himself. If I'd known that was going to happen, I'd never, never, have applied the pressure I did. Pressure?! It was a trick. He thought he had more time on his loan. You gave him 24 hours to vacate the only home he ever knew. Hart: Arthur-- may I call you Arthur? When I foreclosed on your father's farm, many years ago, my partners and I may have... falsified certain documents. But I'm now willing to give you a complete refund. With interest... and no questions asked. Stop! Stop it! The time for deceit is over. Hold it right there, Fuller. Put the gun down or I'll push the button, the one that'll end all our lives. You're bluffing. Fuller: You want to call my bluff? It's a horrible way to die. Yeah, we've seen. It's a nice trick... faking your own death to avoid suspicion. Thank you. And thanks to Mr. Hart... Scottsville's become more urban. We have more and more homeless drifters than ever. The body outside your lab. One of our drifters was kind enough to volunteer. Volunteer. Yeah, right. John: Is that what these attacks are all about? Vengeance? Yes. Righting a wrong. Carl here cheated my father out of his land and built a mini mall where his farm used to be. My father was left with nothing! Now it's time... to bend our plows back into swords and destroy the urban slime that sucks the lifeblood from our sweet, simple town! There you are. I thought you'd be-- Hurry! The timer's going. - Well, turn it off. - There's no stop button. - There are no buttons at all. - Somebody untie me! John: Let's get out of here! Come on! John: Come on, let's go! Go! - What's happening? - It's over. - We're blowing up the barn. - Little sooner than we thought. - What about my babies? - Give it up, Fuller. What about the years of scientific research and the loving, the caring that went into them? You can't just-- - Ally: Hey! - Ally! - It's too late! - Fuller: My babies! My babies! My babies! Thank goodness. We're free of that nut. Now I can get back to business. The only place you're going is to jail. To jail for what? Because of what you told Fuller about his father's farm. - I heard it all. - John: So did I. She heard, he heard. So what? So I swindled the old man out of his land. Big deal. You haven't got any proof. - It's your word against mine. - Logan: I wouldn't say that. We heard it too. And I got it all on tape. John: Good going, honey. Thanks, Daddy. Howard, place Mr. Hart under arrest. - Howard: Up against the car. - Are you serious? Up against the car, dogmeat. You have the right to remain silent. If you refuse the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you - in a court of law. - Hart: Ow! Howard: You have the right to an attorney... This will get me in good with the City Council. Think they'll let me keep my job? I don't think you'll have a problem, Chief. Some honeymoon, exploring caves for bats. - Are you having fun? - Most of the time. You'll love this cave. The guidebook says that over a quarter of a million bats nest here. Man, that's a lot of bats! I hope I brought enough videotape. - John: What the-- - Ally: Oh, not again.
