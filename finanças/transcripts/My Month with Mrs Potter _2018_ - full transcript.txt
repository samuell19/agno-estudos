Touch one more of my things and I will shoot you dead. Now, put your hands on your head. Well at least you do as you're told, I'll give you that. Now, who the hell are you and what are you doing in my house? - Look. I don't want any trouble. If I didn't want any trouble I wouldn't break into someone's home. - I've got a few problems, all right? I just need money. - Do you honestly think you can get me to feel sorry for you? I'm afraid I'm done feeling sorry for anyone. Now, I want you to move over to the chair, on your right. You're making my arms ache. Now sit. Sit. I see you've broken one of my vases. - What are you gonna do to me? - I haven't quite made my mind up yet. I could go to the police. Or I suppose I could shoot you. But, on the other hand, whoever heard of blowing somebody's head off with an umbrella? Where do you think you're going? To make a cup of tea. Will you care to join me? - I could hurt you. If I wanted to, I could really hurt you. - Could you now? Oh, I don't think you could. I've got a month left to live. Oh, the look on your face. You didn't expect that, did you, when you came crashing in? So, come on, do your worst. Because if you think I care about anything you might do to me, you're dafter than you look. Earl Gray all right? - Everything has a beginning, doesn't it? A starting point. That moment when it all kicks off, the same way everything has an end. Only sometimes it's not until you look back that you can see it. But it is kind of where it all began for me, in the middle of the night in some god-forsaken little village miles away from anywhere. My month with Mrs. Potter, although strictly speaking, I suppose it did actually begin like this. Come on, Jack, let me in on this, I can do it. - You're not ready yet. This isn't some purse snatching we're talking about. - I know that. - Forget it. - You're such a spoil sport, Jack. Why don't you let him tag along? He might learn something. - Look. Look, I'll do whatever you need me to. I could keep a lookout. - Extra pair of eyes. Can't hurt. - Vinnie won't like it. You know how he gets with new faces. - You know me. You know you can trust me. - Okay, but you stay in the car, and you do everything I say, when I say it. You got that? - I got it. I won't let you down. - Nice nap? It's meant to be quite a compliment if someone feels relaxed enough in your house to fall asleep. - I didn't mean to fall asleep. - No, you just couldn't help yourself, could you? - Yeah, well don't get carried away. I was wiped out, I'd have crashed anywhere. - Oh, that's it, ruin the moment, why don't you? Anyway, drink your tea, before it gets cold. - What time is it? - Why? Is there somewhere you need to be? - No. - No more houses to break into? - I said no. - Ooh, calm down, someone might hear you. - It is just you here, isn't it? - What, do you mean apart from my four strapping sons? Oh, don't be ridiculous, of course it's just me. Do you seriously think if anyone else were here they would've slept through all your racket? - I only broke a vase. - I don't mean that racket. I mean you shouting in your sleep, yelling. - You're mental, you know that, don't you? - No dear. Not mental. Just cancerous. Would it have anything to do with this? - Did you go down my bag? Give it back. - You haven't finished your tea. Back so soon? - Who is it? - I have no idea. - Did you call the police? - When? - Did you call them? - No. - Then who is it? - Shall I go and look? - No. - Fine. Then neither of us will be any the wiser. I should probably warn you that if it's Ellie and I don't answer, she will be coming around the back any minute, she has a key. - Get rid of her. - Who, Ellie? I'd rather not. - I said get rid of her. - But then again, it may not be Ellie, it could be Dr. Evans. Although... - Do you seriously think I care? Just make 'em go away. - Hello? It's only Ellie, Mrs. Potter. Lovely morning out there. Oh, you made me jump. I thought you must be upstairs. I'm sorry, I didn't get around in time. Cup of tea? - Oh, you couldn't make it a coffee, could you? And heavy on the sugar, I feel like an absolute zombie. Late one last night. - Oh, Ellie, not again. You've got to ease up on these late nights. What have I told you? - I'm not that bad. And anyway, guess what? It's been three months today since I quit smoking. Well, apart from that one last relapse, but that was at my cousin's wedding and it was so depressing, weird! Seriously, she wore black, I mean, what kind of a bride wears black to her own wedding? And I was a bridesmaid and she had us in this hideous dark purple. - Sit down for a minute. - No, best not. I might never get up again. So what's on the list? - Oh, hoovering mainly, the floors are in a dreadful state. Oh, and if you wouldn't mind giving my bathroom the once over. Oh, and the sitting room. Oh, no no, don't go in there. Floor is covered in broken glass. - Glass? - Yes. - What happened? - Somebody broke one of my vases. - Oh well, accidents happen. I'll clean it up if you like. - Oh, you most certainly will not. You'll do that, won't you? Before you leave. - Mind you don't cut yourself. How did you manage to break it? Do always do the housework with your rucksack on your back? So how do you know Mrs. Potter? - What's it to you? - Nothing. Just naturally nosy, I suppose. I'm Ellie, by the way. - Well maybe you should learn to wind in your neck, Ellie. - Is there a dustbin for this? - Find it yourself. - If you were hungry, you should've said something. When did you last eat? Sit yourself down, I'll make something for you. I do think it's about time you told me your name. - Why? - For one thing, it's polite. And you have helped yourself to my biscuit tin. And I really ought to introduce you to Ellie. - I don't want you to introduce me to anyone. - She'll think it very odd if I don't. Sliced white, I'm afraid. It's all I've got in. All right. Let's try something new. My name is Anna. But you can call me Mrs. Potter. Look, you might as well tell me who you are, otherwise I'm going to have to make something up, and then you could find yourself saddled with a name like Octavius or Cyril. Oh, you may well laugh, but be given the Cyril is no laughing matter, my father was called Cyril, and he was not a happy man. - My name's Ryan. - Well then, Ryan, I'll dish this up. Oh! Oh! - Are you all right? - What have you done to her? I haven't done anything, I haven't touched her! - Well you must've done something, I've never heard her call out like this before. - Look, I never touched her, all right? - Then what's the matter with her? - Somebody please get me a seat! - I think I should call the doctor. - No. But if you're not feeling well... - I said no! If you want to make yourself useful, can you dish that up? Ryan here hasn't had a square meal in I don't know how long. There's toast. - It's not like you to have visitors. - Well, sometimes they just turn up. Go on, tuck in. - So who is Ryan, then? Family friend? - Oh, no, no no, not really. He's my son. - Have you seen Mrs. Potter? - She went upstairs for a lie-down. - She's still not feeling well? Did you call the doctor? - You heard her. She doesn't want a doctor. - Yeah, well what she wants and what's good for her aren't necessarily the same thing, are they? - Nothing to do with me. - What do you mean it's nothing to do with you? She's your mum, apparently. Anyway, I'm off, I won't disturb her if she's lying down. Can you just let her know not to worry about my singing lesson today? We'll do it when she's feeling better. Well can you? - Fine. - Oh, you're still here. Where's Ellie? - Gone. - Nice girl, Ellie. Don't think she likes you much. - Don't think I care. - Why did you say I was your son? - Well, I had to say something. - You could've said anything. You could've said a plumber. - I don't need a plumber. - You know what I mean. - Oh, why are you still here? I suppose you're still hoping to steal from me while I'm not looking. - No. I need somewhere to hide, just for a few hours, until it gets dark. - Who's after you, Ryan? - Is that it? - It's 10 million quid. - Whoa, what's he doing here? - Just take it easy. We've done everything he's asked us to do. Let's just get this over and done with. You keep out of this, and you stay in the car. You got something for me then, Jack me boy? What's he doing here? - Don't worry yourself about him. He's just my insurance. You know how much I love insurance. - You got the money? - Of course I got the money. - I want to see it. - What's the matter, don't you trust me? - Oh, I trust you, Vinnie. I just don't know why you brought him here. - Who's your little friend? - Oh, him? He's a nobody. Just a driver, that's all. - Yeah? Well it might've been nice if I'd have known about this, mightn't it? Well? - I'll get him. - Nothing personal, Jack me boy. Get the diamond. - Can I get you something to eat? I should cook you something. Come on, you were starving when you got here, and heaven only knows when you'll get your next proper meal. - No. - Well at least let me make you a sandwich. - Sliced white? - Better than nothing. But if you ask me, dietary fiber is hugely overrated. - Go on then. - Cheese and pickle. I won't have meat in the house. I've been a vegetarian for 40 years. Can't bear the thought of eating anything that used to breathe. - Fair enough. - I do kill wasps though. Where will you go? - Maybe North Scotland. - Do you have family there? - I don't have any family. - Well, you mean none that'll own you. - Just none. - It's a long way to Scotland from here. - That's the idea. - How would you get there? You said you got no money. - I'll figure it out. - That's what bothers me. Dark enough for you? Oh, this is ridiculous. - What do you mean? - I can't possibly let you go like this. Look at you. You're a child. - I'm 22 years old. - Exactly, a child. You can't even look after yourself properly. Well I've done all right so far. - You are a thief, being pursued by a gang of dangerous criminals, and you call that doing all right? - I'll work it out. - How? What is your grand plan? - Well... - Oh, don't bother. You haven't even got one, have you? "I might go to Scotland." - All right, if you're so clever, what do you reckon I should do? - You could... You could stay here. - What? - Well, why not? You could stay here, you could hide out here. It's only me, and in a few weeks' time, who knows? They might've given up. At the very least, your trail or whatever it is you've left behind you might've cooled off a bit, make it harder for them. But go on, say something, quickly, before I change my mind. - A few weeks? - Give or take. After that I'm afraid you're on your own. - Oh, good, you've surfaced. How did you sleep? - Good, yeah. - Well, get yourself some breakfast. - Lunch, more like it. - Oh, Ryan was never one for early rising, were you? Besides, he's been traveling. Goodness only knows the last time he slept in a proper bed. That's enough to wear anyone out. Oh, what now? Excuse me a moment, Ellie, while I get that. - So I hear you've just got back from India. What was it like? I've always wanted to go to India. - It was, well you know, it was like, hot. - Whereabouts did you stay. - I just traveled around, you know, like you do. - Yeah, like you do if you've got money. Oh, although I suppose your mum paid. - No. - No? So did you work out there then? - Yeah. Yeah, I did, as it happens. - Doing what? - Fruit picking. - In India. - Yeah. - I bet you've got some great photos. - I didn't really. Couldn't be bothered. - What? You went all the way to India and didn't take any photos? - Yeah. - Who does that? So how long were you out there for, then? - A while. Look, what is it with you and all your questions? - Yeah. It must've been a while, because I mentioned you to a few people in the village and they didn't even know Mrs. Potter had a son. - Well, clearly she does. - Oh, clearly. Just a shame it happens to be one who doesn't give a toss. - What are you talkin' about? - You, you turn up here after goodness knows how long and have her running around after you making you up a bed, cooking you breakfast, looking after you. It's not been easy for her, you know, since your dad died. All I'm gonna say is I hope you plan on sticking around this time. I don't think she's very well. She needs someone. I think it's about time you start pulling your own weight. Sorry about that. - Everything all right? - Oh, yes, yes, just doctors, you know how it is. The minute they know your blood group they think they own you. - We could do this another time if you like. - Oh no no. Ryan, breakfast, kitchen, lunch, whatever time of day it actually is. - You spoil him. - Nonsense. I don't see enough of him to spoil him. Right, where were we? - Okay, Mrs. Potter, if you could take a big breath in for me, and out. And then in. And out. In. Excuse me. What do you think you're doing? - I'm sorry. - How dare you. How dare you poke around in my house when you think I'm not looking. You do not touch those. Do you think you have the right to wander around here as if you own the place? Well do you? You are only here because I am allowing you to be here, and you will do well to remember that. - That jacket looks ridiculous, but I didn't much like it on my husband either. - It's better than pajamas. - Oh, I rather liked pajamas. - You used to be an actress. - You did have a good look around. - Maybe I should just go. - No, no, no, no. I overreacted, it's a bad habit of mine. We have to get you some more clothes, though. My husband's aren't quite, well, they're not really you. I'll give you some money. - Why? Why would you do that? - Because you don't have any. - Why do you even care? This is crazy. Me staying here. It makes no sense. You could've just invited a murderer into your own home! What is it, Mrs. Potter? What do you want? - I don't want anything. - That's not how it feels. - Oh? How does it feel? - Weird. I don't think I like it. Why do you want me here? - Because I can't bear the thought of dying alone. - I can't believe you're letting me down again. You said you'd be here and you're not. Yes Matty I know you're busy, we're all busy, it's just I was really hoping for once you'd be bothered to turn up. - How come you gave up acting? - Sorry? Oh, not sure I was really good enough. - Do you miss it? - No. I would've liked to have done some more Shakespeare, but other than that. How about you? Have you ever done a proper job? - Well, depends what you mean by a proper job. I mean, I've been paid to do stuff, yeah. - Well, my gardener is off work indefinitely with a bad back. Know anything about gardening? - Not really, no. - Then it'll be a good opportunity for you to learn. Get a skill behind you. - I'm not too sure about that. - Finished? Splendid. ♪ It takes time to beat you ♪ ♪ And it's hard to see through ♪ ♪ All of your lies and all of your ploys to fool me ♪ ♪ Trying to love you ♪ ♪ You just walk away ♪ ♪ Don't look back ♪ - Yes, my love, what can I get you? - Pint of Beck's, please. ♪ And I don't know why, why ♪ ♪ You leave without a thought ♪ ♪ Leave me broken and distraught ♪ ♪ Now you're gone and I don't know why ♪ - Come for the music, have you? - No. Why? - Well she does draw quite a crowd, does our Ellie. Well I just come here for a pint. - That'll be two pounds 90 then. Are you staying or just passing through? - Don't know yet. - Well, we are a bit off the beaten track here, but I like to think we're a friendly enough bunch, so I hope to see you again. - I don't know, you turn up out of the blue, move back in with your mum, and suddenly you're everywhere. - So that's who you are, Mrs. Potter's boy. Well why didn't you say? Ellie's been telling us all about you. How is your mum? I've not seen her for years, literally. - Yeah, she's... - Ellie, didn't you say he's just come back from India? - So he says. - Do you know that's somewhere I've never been. Well, I've not been many places, truth to tell, although I am rather partial to lands erotic. But you should get together with my husband, he's been to India. Years ago, mind, but he loved it. You can compare notes, and photos, I bet you got lots of those. - No. Actually I haven't. I went traveling, all right? I didn't have to take photos to prove it. - Just saying. - What is your problem? You're so rude. - Yeah, well, maybe she shouldn't be so nosy. She was just trying to make conversation. - I see you didn't persuade your boyfriend to show. - What? Oh, get lost. - Where have you been? - To the village. We needed some bread, and I got you this. - What is it? - I spotted it in a secondhand bookshop. You said you liked Shakespeare. - Well, I do appreciate the thought, Ryan, but if I wanted to read Shakespeare, I could do so every day of the week. I do have every play he ever wrote upstairs. - Every play? - Yes, he did write more than one, you know. - Oh. Well, look, it's there if you need it. - Thank you, Ryan, it was a kind thought. Oh, by the way, the grass around the front needs cutting. - Yes ma'am. Ryan. Ryan? What? - Oh good, there you are. Read this with me. - What? - Sit down and read this with me. - Thought you was ill when you shouted. - I am ill, now shut up and read. I start. What country, friends, is this? - This is... - Illyria. - What? - E-leer-e-uh. - Illyria, this is Illyria, lady. - And what should I do in Illyria? My brother, he is in Elysium. Perchance he is not drowned. What think you, Salas? - It is per... - Chance. Perchance, it means by chance. - It is perchance that you yourself were saved. - Oh, my poor brother. And so, perchance, may he be? - What is this? - You know what this is, Ryan, this is Twelfth Night. Now, come on. They have been shipwrecked, all right? Viola and her brother Sebastian have been shipwrecked. Ryan, this is a famous play, a great play. - Yeah, but what's the point if you don't understand it? - What's the point? Ryan, this is Shakespeare, there couldn't be a better point. No son of mine is not going to appreciate Shakespeare. I can see that I'm going to have my work cut out for me here, aren't I? Now, go on, try it again. - What I'm saying is, Frankie, like you get it to me by the end of the week, I'll fetch you a fair price, with the usual fee for commission. What you mean? All right, I'll call you back, mate. No, wait, wait, wait. Tell Vinnie he'll get his money. I've had a few cash flow problems, but as soon as it's sorted, he's as good as paid. You said a week. - Look, it's not my fault, all right? I mean, what do you want me to do? I've put the word out. No one's seen him! Come on, you know what it's like. Maybe a week was pushing it, but he'll resurface. And when he does, you'll have him. I just need more time. - Well, Dylan, time's running out. Don't disappoint me. - Stand you a while, alo, aloof. - That's right, aloof, ah-loof. - Isn't that something you scrub yourself in the bath with? - Oh, very clever. Actually, not so clever. That is a loofa. Carry on. - Caesario, thou knowest no less but all I have unclust. - Unclasped. - I have unclasped to the even book of my secret soul. I don't even know what I'm talking about. - Oh, you'll soon get the hang of it. - Why don't I just go and cut the hedge? - Get on with it. - Therefore, good youth. I'll get that. - You're not getting out of it that easily. Now come on, read. Dear lad, believe it. - Try it with more confidence, more authority. This man is the duke. Listen, dear lad, believe it. For they shall yet belie thy happy years that say thou art a man. Diana's lip is not more smooth and rubious. Thy small pipe is the maiden's organ, shrill and sound, and all is semblative of woman's part. Now you go. - All right. Dear lad, believe it, for they shall yet belie those happy years that say thou art a man. - Ooh, read with real passion, that one. - I've had enough of this. Oh, don't stop, I was just starting to enjoy it. Mrs. Potter, where did you learn how to read Shakespeare like that? It sounded very impressive. - She used to be an actress. - No way. Why did you never say? - Oh, well, it was all rather a long time ago now, I can scarcely remember it. Right. I expect you've come here to do some singing, so, let's go and sing, shall we? - Don't take after your mum, do you? With your acting skills. - Wasn't my idea. - No, I'm not knocking it. I don't think I've ever seen her this happy. You're obviously doing her good. It's just... - It's just what? - She seems to think the world of you, Ryan. Just don't hurt her. See ya. Oh, by the way, you missed a bit. - Mrs. Potter, the hedge is done. Mrs. Potter. - Look at all this. You forget, don't you? The years rush past and life takes over, and molds you and squeezes you and forces you into something else. I was a good actress. - You still are a good actress. - Oh, obviously you are the expert. - I've heard your Shakespeare. It sounded pretty good to me. - Oh, Shakespeare. You don't even understand it. I was cast once in it. About a million years ago. Twelfth Night at the RSC. - What happened? - Nothing, I didn't do it. - Why? - It doesn't matter. - Why, if you loved it so much, why did you stop? - Do you know, I really think I should put all this clutter, this stuff, away. That is all in the past. My whole life is in the past. - Don't say that. - Why not? It's true. - It doesn't have to be. - Oh, don't be so stupid, I'm dying! - We're all dying. But we're not dead yet. - Well, if it isn't the traveler. What can I get you, my love? Pint of Beck's? - Yeah, good memory. - Part of the job. You decided to stay around for a bit, then? How long were you in India for? - Oh, only a year. - Oh, well, that's the way to do it, isn't it? You can see it all in a year. Get real flavor of the culture. Mike were only there six weeks. What did you think of Mumbai, did you like it? Oh, you went to Mumbai, obviously, everyone who goes to India goes to Mumbai. - Obviously. Yeah, nice. Lovely people. - 2.90 then, please. Thanks love. How's your mum today? - Yeah, she's good, thanks. - You know you really ought to drag her down here. Well it can't be good for her to be cooped up in that cottage day after day. Not that I'm saying there's anything wrong with the cottage, it's lovely, but well she'd come down here with you, wouldn't she? She could have fun showing you off. I'm so sorry I'm late. - Oh, you're late? I hadn't noticed. Anyway, like I say, you must get together with Mike. Go and have a proper chat. - Can hardly wait. - I know what you should do, you should get your mum to put on a performance. - What? - A performance. - What are you talking about? - Oh come on, keep up. Your mum, she could put on a performance. A concert. - A performance of what? - You know, Shakespeare. Bits and pieces, poetry. She could do readings. - Aren't you supposed to be working? - Oh, I will be in a minute. It's just such a good idea, don't you think? She could rehearse and stuff. I mean, she reads beautifully, people would love it. - What people? - People in the village, mm! She could do a whole concert, sell tickets. - What actually makes you think she'd want to do that? - Ryan, it'd be good for her. Just what she needs to stop her being so isolated. - I don't think she ever wants to stop being isolated. - Well if anyone could persuade her, you could. Look, if she doesn't want to have people in the house, she could do it in the garden. And I could always perform. Put a bit of music in to break it up. - I don't think she'd do it. She spends her whole life avoiding everyone. She won't do it. I'm telling you. - Well you won't know unless you try. Please. - Absolutely not. I never heard of anything so ridiculous in my whole life. - Told you. - But why not? You're always encouraging me to perform. - That is entirely different. You're young, and gorgeous, and you've got so much to offer. You should be out there in front of an audience. - So should you. - Look at me. I'm old, and shriveled. I hardly recognize myself. - How can you say that? You're beautiful. And you're certainly not old. Old is like 98 these days. - Well, I feel 98. - Look. You never know. You might enjoy it. - I said no! How much more clearly do I have to express myself? Now, can we please have an end to this ludicrous conversation? - You can't, you can't, you can't, no! Bring him back, bring him back! Bring him back! Mrs. Potter. Mrs. Potter, you're dreaming. Is it you? - Do you want a biscuit? I've added some sugar in your tea. It might help. Bad dream? Do you wanna talk about it? - My baby. My beautiful baby boy. He died. Oh, it was years ago. Like everything else. My poor husband, Peter, and I were desperate for a child. And it wasn't happening. I felt such a failure. And then, one day, I discovered I was pregnant. It was about the same time I was cast in Twelfth Night. And it was the most wonderful, glorious moment. I could still have done the play, but I decided not to. You see, I wanted to give it, give us, the best possible chance. But it wasn't enough. After seven and a half months, almost to the day, my baby boy died. - I'm sorry. - Don't be. It's not your grief, is it? It's mine. And I've learned to live with it. It may not seem like that to you, but I have. It's just that that nightmare, that horrible recurring nightmare, it won't leave me alone. I've still got his baby clothes. My mother knitted them. Cancer got her too, you know. My mother. Hateful disease. Hateful, hateful disease. Good morning. Breakfast's ready. I thought something rather substantial was called for. We have a lot of work to do. - Have we? - I've been doing a bit of thinking. Not much else to do when you can't sleep. And I've changed my mind. - About? - The concert. Sit. - What, you mean you're gonna do it? - Yes, why not? Come on, eat up. - Well where's yours? - Oh, I can't seem able to keep anything down. - Next Saturday? You mean a week this Saturday? - Yeah. - Ryan, that's ridiculous. We'll never get it organized in time. She's got rehearsing to do. I've got rehearsing to do. We've gotta let people know. You did tell her it was ridiculous, right? - It's what she wants. - When I said we could put on a performance, I meant like, in two months' time, maybe. Not in 10 days. - It's what she wants! - Nuts, completely nuts, I hope you and your mother know you are absolutely nuts. But 10 days, I've never heard of anything so ridiculous. - I don't see the problem. Strike while the iron is piping hot, that's what I say. - But why the rush? There's so much to be done. - Oh, come on, this is hardly the West End. It'll be fun. We'll make it fun. You were right. This is just what I needed. It can be my swan song. - But that's the point. We don't want it to be your swan song. Look, this could be the beginning of something, a fresh start for you. I mean, who knows where this could lead? Look, why don't we give ourselves, I don't know, six weeks. I'm, this whole thing could be so much better if we just had more time. - Nope, Saturday week. That's my final offer. We do it then or not at all. - Nothing to do with me. - Anyway, I'm off. I told Morwenna I wouldn't be long, she'll be wondering where I am. But get started. - Oh, I intend to. - What? - Oh, nothing. Just good to see that the ice has melted. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Oh, I'm sure I detected a certain between you. - You and your big words. - So, tell me I'm wrong. - She has a boyfriend. - No she hasn't. She has a waste of space, and that is an entirely different thing. - We should build a stage. - We don't really need a stage. We just need to be raised up a bit. A platform. Hey, you could knock one of those together. I mean how hard can it be? Oh come on, you can work it out. - Oh, they've got some stage blocks down at the village hall. I'll ask if we can borrow those. - I don't suppose they've got any chairs, have they? - Chairs, yeah. Teacups, WI speaker rotors, air fresheners, toilet rolls. You name it, the village hall's got it. - Oh my word. What have I been missing all these years? - All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players. They have their exits and their entrances, and one man in his time plays many parts. His acts being seven ages. - Now good sweet nurse, oh lord, why look so sad? - I am a weary. Oh, give me leave a while. Fie how my bones ache. Oh, what jaunt have I. - Oh would thou hadst my bones and I thy news. Nay come, I pray the speak, good, good nurse, speak. - Oh, what haste. Can you not stay a while? Can you not see that I am out of breath? - How art thou out of breath when thou has breath to say to me that thou art out of breath? - Supper! In the garden! - Wow, this is all a bit posh. - If you think this is posh, you've clearly lived in the village for far too long. - I'll get another chair. - No no, I'm not stopping. My husband loved it, but I could never get my head around the whole concept of al fresco dining. You two have fun. - Mrs. Potter. - No need to thank me. - We should probably. - Yeah. Yeah, we probably should. Must've been awesome growing up with a mum like Mrs. Potter. - Yeah. How about you? What are your parents like? - Yeah, they're great. Although I do sometimes get the feeling they're tapping their feet, waiting for me to spread my wings or something. - Why don't you? - I suppose I'm just a bit frightened. - Frightened? You? - Well you needn't look so surprised. my brother, he's eight years older than me, and he's a marine biologist. Pretty tough act to follow. - I can't really see you as a marine biologist. - Oh, thanks a lot. - No no, you know, I don't mean it like that, it's just that you're creative, aren't you? - Is that really the best you can do? - Well, it's a good thing. It's nice. - Nice? Oh, stop right there, Ryan, you're making it worse. - Do you know what you want? - I think I want to be a musician. I suppose that's what scares me. - Why? - Well, supposing I do it and really go for it, and I fail. - Well, I suppose that's the risk you take. You know, you won't know if you don't try. - Huh. So what about you? What's your grand plan? - Don't really have one. Don't really have a un-grand plan. - Well maybe it's time we make you one. Okay, let's think. What are your qualities? What are you good at? I think you're good with your mum, and you're not bad with a pair of sheers. On the downside, you are terrible when it comes to reading Shakespeare. On the upside, you do make a decent dinner companion. - So, where does that all lead me? - Wherever you want it to, Ryan. Wherever you want it to. - Dear lad, believe it, for thou shall yet belie those happy years that say thou art man. Diana's lip is not more smooth and rubious, thou small pipe is at the maiden's organ, shrill in sound, and all is semblative a woman's part. - Oh, don't stop. You're actually beginning to sound quite good. - You get some rest. You've got a busy day tomorrow. - Bossy boots. Ryan. Thank you. - Could I, there's something I've been meaning to tell you. - Ooh. This sounds ominous. Perhaps we better wait till I'm more awake. - No. My name isn't really Ryan. - Is that all? I may be old, but I'm not stupid. Do you think I hadn't worked that out for myself? Different name for every different job, I shouldn't wonder. Now, get back to Ellie. I'm trying to go to sleep here. - My name is David. - And a very handsome name it is. It suits you. You should use it. Be proud of it. Well. I'm very pleased to know you, David. - Is she okay? - Yeah. She's fine. - She doesn't look fine. She hasn't done for days, not really. - She's been overdoing it. She needs rest. - No, it's not just that, I know it's not. Nobody has the doctor round every day because they've been overdoing it. Especially not Mrs. Potter. Look, I care about her too, you know. - Yeah. I know. Right, this goes nowhere, do you understand? You don't tell anybody. You certainly don't tell Mum. - Of course not. - She's got cancer. - Why didn't she say anything? - You know what she's like. She doesn't like to tell anybody. I've got my work cut out getting her just to try and see the doctor. - Is that why you're here? Is that why you came back? I can't believe it. She's so full of life. She's more alive than anyone else in this village. How long? If there's anything I can do. - No. You do enough. You're good for her. She likes you. - I should go. - Let me walk you. I'll be fine. - No, I want to, it's dark. - I'm so sorry, Ryan. Oh, I'm sorry. I don't know what... I've got a boyfriend. - No you haven't. You've got a waste of space. - Go, you're with Dylan. - Dyl, it's Connor. - Connor? Where the hell've you been? You know the mess you've got me in? You took his pretty diamond. - He killed 'em, Dyl. He killed 'em right in front of me. - Yeah? Well guess what, you're next. Vinnie's right pissed off, man. He's got the Fixer after you. I've had the both of them breathing down my neck. - Don't you think I know that? Look, I'm sorry, all right, and I need your help to get rid of this stone. - Well, good luck with that one, mate. Do you have any clue how hot that rock is? You've got no chance. - Why do you think I'm calling you, Dyl? Please. - Where are you? Come on, mate. I can't help you if I don't know where you are. - I'm about 40 miles away, in a village called West Dunlee. There's a pub called The Cross Keys Inn. You can meet me outside. - I'll be there in a couple hours. - No no no no, not today. I've got something I gotta do. Something like what? - Listen, just call me when you get outside the pub, or just text me. - Connor! - Just think that she's, Ryan, hi. What are you doing here? Sorry, my mind's all over the place. Anyway, Ryan, this is Matty. - Hello mate. - He only got back last night, didn't you Matty? I didn't even know he was coming back. - Yeah, it was a bit of a last minute decision. - Okay, Ryan, Morwenna's gonna have the buffet food and drink ready for you to collect from the pub by two. She's gonna leave it around the back. - What do you mean ready to collect? Her husband's coming up in a van. - No, he can't. I don't know, I think something cropped up at the brewery? - Well how am I supposed to get all that stuff back without a car? - No problem. Morwenna's borrowed you a shopping trolley from the supermarket. You can push it. - Push it? What, all the way back to the cottage? - Yeah. The exercise will do you good. Anyway, I'll see you later, all right? Oh, I'll come by and help you finish setting up after four. - Yeah, thanks. - You're welcome. - With his big, manly voice, turning again toward childish treble, pipes and whistles in his sound. Last scene of all in this strange, eventful history, is second childishness, and mere oblivion. Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans... Sixth age shifts to the lean and slippant Pantaloon, spectacles on nose, pouch on side. Who are you? What do you think you're doing? - I was hoping for a quick word with your son. - He's not here. - That's all right. I'll wait. - Oh no you will not. I have a huge amount of work to do, and around 60 people arriving shortly, so no, you will leave, now. - Don't mess me about. There's a good girl. Where on Earth are you, Ryan? 2:00 I told you the soup would be ready for pickup. You need to get here now. Oh, and there's some man looking for you, Morwenna said he called by the pub asking. He had a photo. Anyway, she thought it was a bit weird, so she didn't tell him where you were, but... - No! No, run! - Honestly, I can't believe Ryan's not fetched this food. I mean, what does he think he's playing at? - Well where is he? You couldn't have timed that any better. The buffet's in the trolley all ready to go. No sign of Ryan. You couldn't help us, could you? If there's two of us pushing it, it won't take a moment. - El, I can't, I've gotta head back to London. - What are you talking about? Why, you've hardly been here five minutes. You are staying for the concert, right? - I wanted to, you know I wanted to, but I did say I didn't know if I could be there. - You're unbelievable. - El. - So that's it. You're just off right now, are you? I don't suppose you can spare just a few moments of your precious time to help me with this food? - Sorry, I can't, I tell you now, I'm gonna miss my train. Look, I'll call you later, I promise. - Yeah, well don't knock yourself out. - You all right? - I'll be fine. Look, Morwenna, I know we're busy, but I don't suppose I can shoot off, I've gotta get this food up the road. - On your own? That's ridiculous. - I'll be fine. - Ellie. - Seriously Morwenna, I'll be absolutely fine. - Well. This is cozy, I must say. Mrs. Potter, is it? You do have a lovely home. - She needs a doctor. She's not well. - Oh. Poor old Mum, eh? Do you think I care? So here's what's going to happen. You're gonna tell me where the diamond is... - I'm not gonna tell you anything. Not until you let her go. She's got no part in this. - Where's the diamond? - It's not here! - Where is it then, hmm? - She needs a doctor. She's not well! - Just tell me where the diamond is! - Even if I tell you, you won't know where it is. You'd have to let me go fetch it first. I'm sorry, do I look stupid to you? - It's at the pub. - At the pub? - I buried it in the garden. - You buried a 10 million pound diamond in a pub garden? Okay. Let's say I believe ya. What am I supposed to do, wait here while you go dig it up? - Yeah. I'll call a doctor first, and then I'll go fetch it. - All right. You go to the pub, fetch the diamond. Me and your mum, we'll stay here, and put the kettle on. Have a cup of tea. That'd be nice, wouldn't it? You got 30 minutes. No doctors, no messing about, or she dies. - No! No. I'm not going anywhere until you get her some help. - I don't think you're listening to me. We're not making deals here. Tell you what. Just to put your mind at rest, stop your worrying, why don't I just shoot your dear old mum now, eh? No! - Put her out of her misery. - No, all right, all right! I'll go. I'll go. - Who the hell's that? Get rid of 'em, now! - What in the world do you think you're playing at, Ryan, and why aren't you answering your phone? Do you have any idea how many times I've tried to call you? 2:00. 2:00 you were supposed to come and pick this lot up. I've just had to push it all the way up here on my own. I mean, how are we gonna have any time to get anything ready now? I bet you've not even put the tables out, have you? I mean, I've got a sound check, I've got myself to get ready, I'm performing too in case you'd forgotten, not that Matty gives a crap either, he's just shot off back to London. Seriously, I cannot believe you're just standing around yakking when we've got so much to get done. Men! I mean, tell me Ryan, is there seriously one of you on this whole entire planet that I can actually rely on? Mrs. Potter, what happened? What's going on? - Call an ambulance, now! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's all my fault, I should never have come here in the first place. - It's nonsense. So what if you made a bit of a mess? So have I. But you, you have time. - So have you. - No. No. I would've liked more time. You taught me more about how to live in the last few weeks than I have learned in the last 30 years! - Don't talk. Don't talk. - Listen to me, that diamond, there's only one right thing to do. You know that, don't you? - I wish, I wish you'd have been my mum. - Well, I'm up for the challenge. Sometimes, I don't think you realize how lonely you are until you meet someone who's even lonelier. When I first met Mrs. Potter, we were two people with no one. I used to think life was all about survival, mine, it didn't matter who I hurt, as long as I made it to the end of another day. Mrs. Potter changed all that. She give me a purpose, a reason. For the first time in my life I knew how it felt to be needed. For the first time ever, someone else is more important to me than me. Mrs. Potter once said to me that a month isn't long. She was right about a lot of things, but not about that. A month can change everything. - Could never get tired of it, could you? This view. Suppose not. - Don't go overboard or anything, will you? - How you been? - Good. Really good. I'm sad this place has been sold, though, finally. I really miss coming here. I mean, I'm glad in one way, she was very tidy-minded, Mrs. Potter. Hated loose ends. - Nice lady. - So how's the grand plan coming along? - Yeah, good. Needs a little tweaking. But it's getting there. How about yours? - I thought I might go traveling. The longer I stay in this village, the smaller it seems. I wanna make music, I know that, and if I'm gonna do it properly I have to make my world bigger. - India's good. - Yeah? So I've heard. - You could do fruit picking. - Can you, though? Really? - Yeah. Just make sure you take some photos. 'Cause you're gonna have a hell of a job trying to convince people you was actually there. - Is that the best travel advice you can give? Just make sure you take some photos. - Well, it's a start, right? - Suppose we could add it to your list of downsides. Gives terrible advice. I left some teabags in the kitchen. Shall I put the kettle on? - In a minute. Can we just stand here a little bit longer? - Of course we can. We can stand here for as long as you like.
