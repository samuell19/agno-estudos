- I love you. - I'm immensely old. - Doesn't matter. - May it matter to you. You grow older every year. I grow older every sordid second. - Doesn't matter. The older you get, the more beautiful you become. Like that chandelier. - I shall love you and love you and love you. Love you and leave you for dead. Oh, well! There he is. Who are you, hm? - Who you into my house? - Some cat brought me. I had a crazy dream. Well, you're wearing my glasses. And you look half starved. Would you like to stay with me? A lot of people do. I'm immensely rich. The deal is this. You live as you choose. You stay as long as you want, or as long as I can put up with you. Whichever period might be the shorter. - Ma'am, uh, I may be a bum, but I worry. - Not to worry. Things will sort themselves out, I promise you. So why don't you start with a little breakfast and see how that grabs you, eh? Oh, wait for me! - I hope you've all had enough to eat. We're not stopping for lunch. - Micky. Can I talk to you, please? - Go away. Tom? Tom! Drive fast. - Sorry. No room. - Who is she, man? - Mrs. Cazaret.

The border of england and Scotland. It is hundreds of years old. It tells the adventures of a young man, held in thrall by the queen of the fairies. Who, in the centuries before pantomime, was reckoned a dangerous lady. It is called "a ballad of tam lin". Good. - Excuse me. Someone wants a puppy. - Everything is possible. Try up there. - Business? I can't have a business. - Well, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Got to think. - I was told someone wanted a puppy. - Oh! - Could only be sue. - That one. The saluki. - Oh, choose a card. The lovers! They mean an ordeal overcome. - And all that gypsy trash. - This way. - Go on, tell me. - Let me see. - Tell me more. It has to be- - one must speak to sue very slowly. She's dim, as a little silky button. - Oh! - Susie? Doggy for you. - Really? Doggy? - There. Is that a genuine dog? Is he mine? - No! Look, she's not to have him. She's doped or something. - Oh, no. Doped, or something? - Give him back! - Give him back. Have they been tormenting you? Scum! You must treat them as scum. Micky, look. - Sue. - Why do you want a dog? - I want to just love him. - She'll take good care of him. I'll see that she does. - I don't want to sell him. - Come. You're from the vicarage, aren't you? Yes, I am. - You must come and visit us sometime. These creatures are really rather sweet. I promise you they won't tease you anymore. Would you sell the puppy to me? How much? - 50 pounds. - Elroy, would you write the young lady a check? Follow me. Sue will be so pleased. Sue! Oh, Micky, thank you. Thank you! Oh, my doggie! - This way. What's your name? - Janet Ainsley. - Wait there, will you? There you are. You could've learnt how not to be a silly little girl. Now you've lost your chance. Large as. I think you'll have to send it back. - Oh, she's so glamorous and... Grand. She looked like a goddess. She's kind, too. I was really cross and upset, but all the time I was with her, I knew that she could give me something I needed. I can't remember now what it was. Did I say something silly? - No. No. - Have you seen Tom? - No, Micky. - Micky? Please. I, I know I can't have you to myself all the time, and I shouldn't have said the things I said. I just wanna stay. - One comes, another goes. That's the economy of life. - But I don't know where to go. I don't know what to do without you! I don't know what to do. - Please! - You can live. You can live. And if you're too hurt to live, you can die. Elroy will drive you to the station. - But I love you. Please. I love you. Please. - Have you seen Tom? - Tom? - Coming. Tom! Tom! Yes? - She wants you. - Are you being a good little good little girl, being as good as you can? - She wants you, now. - Thank you. - There's a good boy. - Do you like my court? - It's beautiful. - I think that I should live here, when I'm old. It's good country for surviving in. They have villages with names like stand against all. Where were you? - In elroy's dark room. - Where will you be when I'm older? You were about to get disgustingly drunk. - When you're old, I shall be in the prime of my life! - Sermon? - Yes. Thank you. - What's it about? - It's about human heartedness. Is that good? - Well, it's the best most of us can manage. - Listen, at about a quarter to 11, turn the oven on to 300. - 300, yes. - Hm? - Yes. - Why? Where are you of to? - To carterhall.

Look, it's a tough environment! You wouldn't last a week in Micky's dreams. - But the bonuses are good? - Yes. You learn how not to care. Well, you simply don't care. It's like breathing pure oxygen.

She tastes like watered milk. Little lies. Scuttling about in there like beetles. - How did you find out? - Never mind. Do you know... Do you know that I'm in love with you? Give me your comment on that. - Doesn't seem likely. - Nevertheless, it's true. It has to do with a collection of quite futile things. For example, the shape of your upper lip. It's almost mysterious. And unlikely. - Doesn't sound like love. - It's love. And you'd better believe me. Because it means that you are an awful lot of trouble. What was that? - Without a doubt, it was the cry of a human voice. Come on. Well, let's go and see. Don't do that, Micky! - There. Swear that you'll love me forever. If they find us, our love is unlucky. I accept it as an omen. - I think it came from nearer the house! Whose human voice do you think it was? - Three guesses. - It's not love. - It's what I need most. - Does that sound like love? - Oh, Micky. Micky, when I tell you I love you, I mean it. And I do love you, almost all the time. - Ah-hah. But when I'm unkind to you, you don't love me. - I do. - No. That's because you're a baby.

Well, if I know whose it is, I can't say anything about it, can I? - Lots of money. Lots of wants. Very strong. Something to do with driving in the dark. Might be lucky.

I believe in god the father, almighty, make up heaven and earth and Jesus Christ, his only son, our lord, was conceived by the holy ghost. - We always hope, and so we should, that love will make us happy. But in this life, outside of the story books, there are no happy-ever-afters. Love is ingrained with anxiety, and sorrow. Through love, in ways we cannot turn aside from, we learn what a heavy thing it is to be human, and that's the start of growing wise. A poet said "we must love one another or die." Well, this is very true. But a second truth cuts deeper. We must love one another and die. If we have the courage and Patience to accept both these truths, together, and try and live by them as best we can, then we are human hearted. May the lord bless to us the preaching of this word and to his name be all glory and praise. Goodbye. Bye bye. Bye bye, Jean.

You take care of that frail flesh, my love. The wiser you get, the farther it takes you from home. We must find you some new interests, mustn't we? Black. - Let's play a soothing game. Something very old fashioned and restrained. We could create tableau vivant scenes of rustic life and Tom could photograph them for us. - What an incredibly tedious idea. - Wait a minute. Shall we be entertained? - I guarantee it. - Then go ahead. - Tableau vivant. Who will our first subject? Anybody? Well, I have a subject. It needs handling with integrity and a lot of heart, but I think it'll be commercial. "She was only a vicar's daughter." - It all sounds very vulgar and boring. - Not at all. This is an unflinching glimpse of a love that dares not speak its name. Featuring, in the role of the vicar's daughter- - elroy! He knows all about those things. - Elroy does not play with the children. Well, then Rosie! - Seated one there at the organ. No, better still. Flat on her back, behind the altar, and bashful, dear! What we're aiming at is a fumbling poignancy that will touch the heart. Now, I am the boy from the big city and I shall be doing a certain amount of poignant fumbling. Oh, no you won't! - I want you to look like that. Lovely. Now. Camera. That's enough. Right. You've made your experiment. I hope you enjoyed it. If you ever cause trouble in my house again, you'll leave at once, is that understood? Answer me! - Yes. - Wipe your nose. You torpid collection. - Well, looks like the end of that party. - Life is an illusion, therefore nothing is permanent. I think I shall go to Sweden. - I have a dog to feed. - The only stayers here are Tom and I, or I and Tom. No settled order. Tom, my old gladiator, are we reconciled? - May I have a few minutes of your time? I assure you I won't keep you long. Won't you sit down? Let me get you a glass. There we are. Oh, you've got blood on that. Vatican cloth. 90 guineas. For what we received, make us truly thankful. I've been Mrs. Cazaret's personal secretary and accountant for about 16 years. During that time, I've bought lots of suits. Lots of children. Bright boys. And out they go, their suits on their backs. And nothing more. - You rancid old queen. What can I do for you? - Nothing, dear. I need to do something for you. In here are two little stories. About dead children, long ago. "Benny shape is an American citizen, no settled occupation, no fixed address, died 10th of August, 1955, aged 21. Sole occupant of Morgan two-seated sports car, property of Mrs. Michaela cazaret, which overturned on the route Napoleon, 14 miles south of granaud. Death caused by multiple injuries, including partial decapitation. Fergus condolan, no settled occupation, no fixed address, died 2nd of September, 1962, aged 20." - What's this got to do with me? - Make an effort, dear. - Work it out for yourself. "Died 2nd September, '62. Sole occupant of a mini Cooper, property of Mrs. Michaela cazaret, which collided with the buttress of a railway bridge on the a40, three miles west of high whitham. Cause of death..." Oh, yes. You wouldn't believe, would you, that a face could spread so wide? You dare touch me! Silly boy. Won't think was made to think. Don't care was made to care.

She can't kill you! - Well, she's rich and they've bought a licence. Well, perhaps it's time you left her, then. You can't stay a boy all your life. - You don't know anything about it. - Well, then tell me. - There's no way you could understand. - I think I could if you'd only tell me. - I've got to get back.

Well, let's not resent each other, hm? Come on. We'll have to go. Miss Gibson? I must talk to you. Got yourself into trouble, have you? - Yes. - And you heard I'd get rid of it for you? Do you want to get rid of it? - Yes. - Do you... Do you know when it was? - Yes. - That seems all right. Have you told him about it? Do you like him? - Yes. - How much money have you got? - I think you ought to tell how much you charge. - Can you afford 100 pounds? - Yes. - I can give you a note to a man in Edinburgh.

Yes, I I found your chart in one of her chest of drawers. Did my father realise she came? - Does your father realise that you've come? If you get rid of the child, you'll be sorry. - But what ought I to do? - I don't tell people what they ought to do. I'll write the note for you. - Oh, oh, it's, it's, it's coming. - It's coming. - Coming. Coming. Oh, my god, that's passion for you. Where's passion's plaything? Tom! - Good morning. Ain't nobody here but me. - Micky, I'm going away for a while. - Have a sticky pick. - No. - Where are you going? - To think. Shall I send a case of champagne to your morbid little caravan? Four pounds a week, all modern conveniences under the hitch. - You followed me. - Oh, no, not personally. What're you going to think about? You know, yesterday, I bought the most astonishing hat.

You've managed to, uh, outlast the rest of them. Tell me, to what do you attribute your success? - Perseverance, as far as it goes. - What makes you persevere? - Times have changed. I think I might be, as they say, the man of the hour. If not, I really ought to be wandering on. - What do you think is expected of the man of the hour? - Oh.

Yes, I think so. - You seem so worried. - Is it about the baby? - No. No. - My father will be coming back soon. Can you tell me what we're going to do?

We're going to London. - We should've gone days ago. - But why? - What are you frightened of? - Look, just hurry up, please! - But why? Why are you frightened to elroy? - It's not elroy, it's Micky. She said she was gonna kill me. She gave me a week's truce and it's up today. Now, will you- - but that's ridiculous! - Yes, of course it is, but it's true. Listen, I love you, I need you and I want you, but, you must hold onto me. - Oh, yes, I will hold onto you. I promise. - Car keys are on the table. - Be with you in one minute. - That will do. - I'm sorry I... Tom? - Put those clothes on. Get in there. We'll be waiting outside. - How perfect to see you again. You look very beautiful. A little starchy. Was it a strain playing house with miss muffet? - What are you going to do? - I am going to have you put down. You don't believe me. For love is kind and suffers long and stews gently in its own sickening juice. Isn't that the accepted theory? - What do you want, Micky? Am I supposed to cry in your lap? - I won't deny you any of the comforts of home. I want you to drink this. If you'd prefer not to swallow it, I can have it poured down your throat. I see I have to teach you as humanely as possible how to become a victim. A victim ought to be empty of any response, except humility and despair. Nothing else is appropriate. - Micky, you are a monster. Jesus. You probably can arrange my death, but you can't arrange the way I feel about it. I want to tell you something, Micky. I want to tell you how you're going to die. No, no, no. No, no, it's a game. It's a game, Micky, and you know all about games. Heart attack game. Sclerosis game. Cancer game! - I won't die! - How do you intend to kill me? - You, in fact, will kill yourself. And I shall arrange the way you feel about it. Drink that. Perhaps you do want to be force fed. That won't hurt you. It's only the beginning. And you have a chance. What sort of game would it be if you didn't have a chance? An outside chance, of course. You see, I never resign myself. I never give in and I never let go. That, my lamb, is the elixir of life. Say something nice to me. I'm feeling rather miserable. Come with me. Brandy for mother. And a cushion for you. - I'll stand. - What are we going to do, then? - We're gonna play a nice old fashioned party game. - What game? - Murder. That's a kid's game. - We shall play an adult version. - You mean for real? - For fun! For real fun. - What do you mean? - You don't understand, do you, dear? Never mind! You're going to have lots of fun! - I don't want anything to do with that. - Anything to do with what? - What you just said! Fun? Real fun? Murder? It's a very civilised game, dear. First, we need a detective. - I shall be the detective. I shall dispense justice. - Next, we need a murderer. Who wants to be a murderer? Well, you force me. I shall be the murderer. And finally, we need a victim. Right. Him. - You'll be the victim. Leave him! Leave him! You may prevent him from leaving the house. Otherwise, he is not to be touched! I am the hunter. I want three bitch hounds. One, two, three. The rest of you, stay on this floor. I shall give you three-minute start. Now we'll set up a court to meet out his punishment! But you're the murderer! - There are subtleties to this game as yet undisclosed. Time. Seek him out. All right. Get back out of the way. Tom? Are you with us? Tom? Are you with us? Take him back. - What was the cause of the victim's death? - He fell and broke his neck. - Bring him back to life. It has been discovered the victim is suspected of a grave crime. Are you guilty? Are you guilty? - The victim is guilty. Take the white car and drive as fast as you can. I shall send my creatures after you. And if they catch you, they'll tear you to pieces. Can you hear me? Wipe your nose. You have three minutes. Off you go. Tom? - It's time. Tom! You need to stop! Tom! Stop! Tom, you'll kill us! Please stop! Tom! Tom! Tom! Tom! - It's over, it's finished. It hasn't worked! - There he is! - Come back here! - No way! Come on back! - How dare you! - It's over, it's finished. - It hasn't happened. Come on back! It wasn't my fault. - No. It wasn't your fault. - Mustn't forget these. - Shall I be all right for money? - I have money everywhere. Here.
