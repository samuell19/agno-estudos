Daddy, I'm scared. I miss Mommy. Marcus? Uh-huh. Just remember for next time. I don't like meeting clients this late at night. I know. I know. Trust me. But, look, you know how the company is. They need to close. And you're the best closer the company has. What do you want me to do? Do you want me to beg? No, you don't have to beg. But dinner... that'd be nice. You got it. Call me with some good news when you're done. Hey, what can I get you? How about a Shirley Temple? Are you sure? I like to live dangerously. Okay. Back to the other bar. - Hold on. Get lost. - Hey. Please. Please. I can pay-- Yeah? How'd it go? - Like they all do. - Good. 'Cause I got another client. Rush job tomorrow. Tomorrow? Brother, my anniversary is tomorrow. I got a PTA meeting at 6:00. What? We have a nine-to-five now? Come on. The world doesn't stop for us. All right. What time? I'll call you with the details. You're an ace, buddy. Live long and prosper. Yeah, yeah, the force be with you too. Let go. - What, what, what? I'm not. - Stop that. Don't. Didn't do anything. - Don't. - What? - You're doing it. - I'm not. - You are! - I'm not doing-- What, what? - You're doing it. - I'm, I'm-- What? - Aah! - Whoop. - Mommy? - Hmm? Can I have some more pancakes? Hmm. Yeah, okay. But how about just one, because last time your eyes were too big for your tummy and you got a bellyache. Do you remember? Okay, but they're so delicious. Well, I thank you for that. They are pretty good, aren't they? Smells so good. - Oh, hey you. - Mmm. Hey, yourself. Daddy! Mm-hmm. Aha! Aha! - La la la la la! - La la la la la! Hey, how was work last night? - Eventful. - Another sale? Come on. - Who are you talking to? - Okay. Well, that's what I like to hear. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. - Mm-mm-mm. - So... What are we gonna do tonight? - Tonight? - Hmm. What do you wanna do tonight? - I-- - Well, there's a game on. - You forgot, didn't you? - Forgot? - About? - Ugh. - You suck! - Oh. Come on. How could I forget about the day I married my unicorn? - You better keep it that way. - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. - I'm working on it. Mm-hmm. - Okay. I gotta go. Love you. - Bye. - Love you. - I'll see you later. - Daddy's got to work. - Bye. - Bye. - Well, - guess it's just you and me, hey, kiddo. - Yeah. Yeah? We're still on for tonight, right? Eight p.m. at the Coal Train. The rest is coming over by text. Right, tonight, 8:00 p.m. I got it. Mm... Marcus? Oh. I'm so sorry. What do we have? This. What the hell does that do? The real question is what can't it do? This is what they call a "crystal matrix unit." It will replace hard drives of any type. Each one of these can contain data of a million supercomputers. Marcus? If anything has a basis for artificial intelligence, this is it. Who are we selling it to? The Chinese, then Arabs, Nigerians, and of course, the Russians. Get up. Can I help you? H-hey, brother. Dimaz, what is going on? No, no, no, no, no, no! No, no! Marcus? Baby! Wait! No, no, no. No! Wait-- Kar-- No! Baby! Baby, baby, baby... Baby... Morning, Marc. How'd you sleep? Good, good. Coffee? Thanks, but I really don't have time. I mean, I'm already late for work. Marc, sit down. Ms. Aitkens, look, um, I am extremely grateful that you moved in after Karla. How could I not wanna take care of my own grandbaby? Still, I mean-- This isn't about me, Marc. This is about you. You've got to start living your life again. I notice it and Kimberley notices it too. You're not happy. And when you're not happy, that affects Kimberley, because she feels helpless. She's already lost her mother. She doesn't need to lose her father as well. Don't worry, baby. I'll find out who did this. Hello, Mr. Garan. My name is Roman Korza, and you are cordially invited to enter into an exclusive contract to eliminate the world's greatest assassin. You will be wired ten million dollars upon services rendered. RSVP by texting the letter Y to 323-309. Upon receiving confirmation, you will be wired expenses to travel to Tokyo. Arigato. Happy birthday, dear Kimberley. Happy birthday to you. Make a wish. - Oh! Good girl! - There you go. What'd you wish for? I wished for Daddy to be happy. Kiddo. Daddy is happy. And as long as I have you, I'm happy. Come here. Okay, let's open some presents. Okay? Let's do it. Wonder what it is. Mr. Garan, well, I can assure you don't need that. I'm only here to talk. May I? Thank you. How'd you find me? We have our resources. I wanna know why you haven't accepted my invitation. It's the opportunity of a lifetime. Thanks, but no thanks. As you can see, I have more important things to do. We know who you are, Marcus. A former company man with all the related benefits. And actually once top of your game. Of course, within your limited sphere of influence. We also know a tragic incident took your wife and shattered your life. And for that, I offer my deepest condolences. And now I know you're focused on tracking her killer. Word in our community travels fast. Now, I've offered you a chance of a lifetime. Look after your family. You heard of Jorg Drakos? Who hasn't? Former Greek EYP lifer said to have killed more people than the plague. Some say he's a myth. - What about him? - The King of Killers, my employer, he wants him eliminated. Who's your employer? Oh, come on, you know the drill. Need-to-know basis, but you don't need to know. Is that a fact? Let's cut the crap out, Marcus. I know you're interested. I gave up that life a long time ago. I'm all my daughter's got left. Yes. But ten million dollars, that's enough to take care of you and Kimberley for the rest of your life. I mean, that will give her the life that she deserves, a good education, a trust fund. It can't be easy being a single parent these days. I'll be expecting your call. Let's talk soon, Mr. Garan. Let's talk soon. Hello? Mr. Garan, Dr. Dean, head of cardiac pediatrics. Hey, Doc. Nice to meet you. What's wrong with my daughter? Let's step over here. I'm sorry, but Kimberley's scan shows an abnormally large heart, specifically affecting her lower chambers, her ventricles. I knew she had a heart murmur, but-- No, this is much more serious than that. In fact, I daresay she was misdiagnosed. Her heart is deteriorating. This will lead to heart failure. Daddy? Hey, kiddo. - I'm right here. - Daddy's right here. Am I gonna be okay? Yeah, of course. You'll be fine. Hey... God is gonna look over you, and so will I. Hey, kiddo, look at me. It's you and me forever, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Mr. Garan. - I'm in. I knew you weren't finished. You're the best the Alphabet Club ever had. - So, who's the client? - Jorg Drakos. What? You're kidding. I doubt they even know where he is. Nobody's ever seen his face. You sure you want a piece of that? No choice. Someone wants him dead. And I need the money. You've never been motivated by money before. What's changed? This is different. Are you okay? 'Cause I know you've been obsessing about Karla's death and trying to find out who might have killed her. Obsessing? I didn't mean it like that and you know it. I loved her like a sister, man. It's just-- I think it was a matter of her being at the wrong place - at the wrong time. - It's Kimberley. - What? - It's Kimberley. She's sick. She needs a new heart. And what I have just won't cover it. I'm sorry. Look, I got a little something tucked away. - It's yours if you need it. - I appreciate that. I really do. But you have a family too. I got to do this. And it's the only way I know how. I understand. Okay. I need a complete rundown on Drakos. Problem is, I don't have my security clearance anymore. Right. Let me see what I can do. So, where are they sending you? Mr. Garan. I am so happy you decided to come. Mr. Korza, one last hurrah. Indeed. You're expected in the penthouse. My assistant, Mrs. Ueno, is waiting for us at the elevator. Let's get started. What's this? I thought I was working alone. Don't get your knickers in a twist, Mr. Garan. All in good time. All in good time. Well, I'm glad you all can make it. Now, I know how eager you all are to get started. So, let's make this brief. I had no idea I was gonna be part of a team. I work alone. I don't need these lame ducks getting in my way. Hmpf. Man, who you calling a "lame duck"? - I'm looking at one. - Oh, really now? Gentleman, gentleman. Please, I think it's time you met my employer. Hello. Oh, it's good to see you all. Thank you for coming. Hope you had a good trip in. You set all this up? I did. - Who are you? - Who am I? That's good question. I... I'm your employer. I'm also a great admirer of your work. You're all the very best in the world at what you do, which make you worthy for the task at hand. Marcus Garan, multidisciplinary "wetman" for the US Intelligence Community with foreign loan-out options till an unfortunate accident took out the love of his life. That is too bad. Scott Angus, deposed J2 member and client of any organized good guys, or even terrorists, with the right amount of legal tender. You like your money. Only hit the wrong mark setting off a war between terrorist factions. Now, they all want you dead. Asha Khanna. MI6 operative for the past 15 years, could have any agency position she wanted, but got tired of the rat race. Dyson Chord, former Marine Force recon Commander for the elite Darkstorms unit and NSA sweeper. Rick Nigel, freelance ASIS employee. Played too many sides once too often that he almost put a hit on himself. Who writes this stuff? A man known as Ren. Miyacho-trained, protector of the Rising Sun, until loyalties changed and started working for the highest bidder. And last, Zachary Hebron, freelance sniper for a private military company. Following orders is not exactly his strong suit. Wow! Wow, wow, wow. Checkmate. Yeah. I do have a bit of a confession to make. You're probably wondering about your quarry. The assassin they say is the best. Drakos? - No one's even seen his face. - No. Maybe he's not that good-looking. Look, I just wanna get this thing started, so I can collect my money. That'll be the day, mate. - What? - Yeah, you heard me. How about I give you a running head start? Anytime, mate. Anytime. No. Patience is a virtue, Mr. Hebron. But I do have some... bad news. I don't know what you've been told. I really don't care. I just, uh, want you to know that this isn't your typical contract. Then what is it? It's more like a competition. - What? - A game! A game, a competition. See who's the best by killing the best. Jorg Drakos. Okay, wait, you want us to compete to see which one of us can get to him first. Yes. Well, this should be fun. No, no. I'm out. Oh, this game you'll play, Mr. Hebron. - Oh, yeah? Why is that? - Mr. Hebron. See, I think you should change your mind. It's not really a good idea. You lied to us in the beginning. The way I see it is I don't know you. I don't know your boss. And I sure as hell don't trust you. Anybody else care to join? Killer queen? Not I. Green Mile? No? See you, mate. I'm out. I told you, mate. That'll be the day. I told you that. Now you know how serious I am. Nobody leaves until the game is finished. His bloody head's off his shoulders. - You deceived us. - Maybe. Maybe. But I expect you all to play to the best of your abilities. Your lives depend on it. You understand me? We don't even know what Drakos looks like. Sure you do. You are Drakos-san. I am. Wait, I'm not getting this. Why hire us to kill you? Why? I love "why" questions. What does it all mean? I'm the best. I've done it all. I've conquered it all. Except for one thing. The elimination of my peers. You, the other assassins, to see who really is the best. And you expect us to go along with that? Is that right? Well, you could ask Mr. Hebron that question. I trust you understand. The job is simple. To kill me, King of Killers. How fun does that sound? But I want you to get some rest first. Mr. Korza is gonna hand you a card, give you access to my entire facility. It's a wonderful place. You can sleep, you can eat, you can work out to your heart's content. Why, thank you. In 24 hours, you have one job, and that is to kill me, or I can guarantee I will kill you. Now, we have a light supper and, uh, tea in the lobby of the hotel later. I expect all of you to be there. See you later. Well, I hope that was informative. You have 24 hours to prepare. Please, use your time wisely, 'cause it may be the last time you have left on this earth. And, uh, if anyone else should have any ideas to depart this event early, just remember one thing, someone is always watching. Curiosity killed the cat, you know. Lucky for you, Asha. You always land on your feet. Lucky me. It's good to see you, Garan. Stop lying. Last time we saw each other, you tried to take me out. Well, you deserved it. Playing doubles with the Alphabet Squad doesn't exactly make for influencing people or making new friends. But I forgive you. So, why are you here? Listen, I heard about Karla. Let's not. Okay. Then business it is. What do you know about Drakos? Other than he's standing in my way of ten million dollars. Nothing. Really? Now who's lying? Okay. What I know is he's holding all the cards. His turf, his rules. And if I didn't know any better, I'd say that's not a window. A monitor. Doesn't matter. I have nothing to hide. Just everything to lose. - All I know is I need to win. - To win... that prize. We'll see. Death is just a part of life. What is this? He's our host, showing us a good time right before one of us takes him out. Sure. I'd love a nice spot of tea before I carve my name into his chest. Contestants, it is with great pleasure that the esteemed Mr. Drakos welcomes you to Japan. This is a simple dinner like a thank you for being competitors in our event. Or perhaps, for some of you, a last supper. What? We get a door prize too? So, where is Drakos? I am here. Call me superstitious, but I don't like to see the participants before the event. Kind of like the groom shouldn't see the bride before the wedding. You leave nothing to chance. You catch on quick. But never mind all that for now. Tonight, I want you to enjoy a well-deserved respite. Agreed? A toast. Gentlemen and lady. Thank you for accepting my offer. Welcome to Japan. May we fight hard and die with honor. Cheers. Till tomorrow. Enjoy your dinner. Until later. You know, it's really interesting. Here we are, the best in the world at what we do. And none of us have ever really met. Some of us have. A lifetime ago. Yeah. It's a small world we live in, isn't it, boys? Reputations are like that. CIA, FBI, NSA, MI6. They always make sure we're informed, even if you're on the other side. Something doesn't sit right. I'm thinking this contest has nothing to do with money, or ego. She ain't wrong. What's this old boy up to? Hmm? Don't look a gift horse in the mouth, fool and his money will soon part, and this fool will make sure it does. We're all, uh, happy with that, are we? I think our boy here is looking for a thrill. Is he, mate? Is that what he's after? - Do you know something we don't know? - - Please, please, please, please. Think about it. How is this different than any other contract we've ever taken, huh? Have to take this. Is it that important? So, how's she doing? Oh, she's fine. She just wanted to say good night. Good night, Daddy. I love you. I love you to the moon and back and back again. Good night, Peanut. When are you coming home? As soon as I can, kiddo. As soon as I can. I miss you. Oh, I miss you so much. Okay? Sweet dreams. I'll see you very soon. Bye. Asha, I know you're there. Now, that was beautiful. So... how should we play this game? This is the same game we've always played. Wow. You really have changed, haven't you? What are you doing? I'm just picking up where we left off. The less of us there are, the better the chance of winning. You don't have to do this. It's not about us. Don't flatter yourself. So, I guess you don't always land on your feet now, do you? Daddy, I'm scared. I miss Mommy. Oh, kiddo. Listen, your Mommy is an angel now and she lives in the stars. So anytime you miss Mommy, all you have to do, you look up at the stars and you can talk to her. And know that she's always looking over you. Okay? So, here's what we're gonna do. Look at this star. I'm gonna put some stars right above your bed. So anytime you wanna talk to Mommy, all you have to do is look up and talk to her. You don't say much, do you? Only when there is something that needs to be said. Contestants. I trust we are all well-rested and refreshed. Just eager to get started. So you should be, Mr. Chord. So you should be. Now, we of course know the exact tool you use in your line of work, down to the blade and to your caliber. Here, you will find everything you need. Please come and feast your eyes. That's what I'm talking about. Not the sniper rifle I'm used to. But this will do. Well, I trust they're all to your satisfaction? Are they ever? So, how does this work? - Is it a game of hide and seek, or what? In a manner of speaking, yes. You're all gonna draw a coin from that bag, determine which order you'll face me. Low coin goes first. High coin goes last. Please, take one. Five. Seven. Eight. Two. Damn, six. Tsk. I guess I go first. No, you're not. And when I get back... ...dinner's on me. If he makes it back. Hey. Look at this. Ah, Angus, going first. Always the good guy. Always the hero. Ain't that right? But this time, rushing in to save the day might be the very last thing you do. Drakos won't make this one easy. He's not supposed to. What's he doing? What's going on here? It's a trap. What's he doing? I mean... He's lost already. You are right. He's fast. You thought this was gonna be easy, didn't ya? Where are you? Where are you? Where are you? I will kill you. Yeah. Y'all know you're never gonna win this. But I love your spirit. We're going about this the wrong way. Look at the terminology he uses, the layout of the floors. He set this whole thing up. It's a chess game. We know this. Not a chess game. A game of chance. Don't you get it? He's a gambler, and gamblers love high stakes. We can't win... 'cause the house always wins. Gentlemen. And lady. Do we have a problem here? We have to change the rules on him. How? We tell him we'll only continue if he takes on all of us at once. - What? - He'll never go for it. Maybe. But I know that the only way we survive this is if we work together. Then we split the prize. - I concur. - So do I. Ren? I think it's weak. So you have a better idea? Yeah. We scrap, and we find out who's the best. Perfect. Then you go next. Whoa, big fella. It's not my turn. Well, you're the only one who wants to keep on fighting in this death trap. So, you wanna be a fool? You know what? Knock yourself out. - You're a coward. - Who's next? You're not even worth it. I don't have all day. I don't care who it is. But someone has got to get in the elevator. You led us here under false pretenses. We were led to believe we'd be hunting you under much different conditions. The game is rigged. Like the Greeks say, the rules are the rules. And I say these rules are the only way you can win. But that's okay. I have a proposition for you. After all, you are a gentleman and a gamesman, right? Not exactly. But I'll bite. All of us versus you simultaneously. No deal. That's not how the game is played. So, you, the King of Killers, is admitting he can't win? Because if that's the case, you're not the best. You had to stack the deck in order to achieve victory, which... really isn't the game of skill you relish so much now, is it? Now the other way, my way, is a true game of skill. Our numbers versus your traps. Come on, Drakos, you're the king. Does the king care to make a wager? Is this psychology? I think I like it. You have a deal. - Let's go. - Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I do have one wrinkle. Of course, you do. Four. I'll only take four of you. So, one of us has to stay here. Well, I think you know me a little better than that. One of you has to be eliminated. One of you has to die, or all of you have to die. Your choice. Wife killer! How dare you! Guys, guys! I hate to break this up. Chord's gone. They say that all those horrible things you did as an operative finally got to you. And after so many years of decorated service, that's why you quit. But did you, Chord? Did you really walk away from the game? I don't think so. Once a player, always a player. Just a different team. So why walk away from this team too? You looking for absolution, Chord? Well, come and get it. Where are you hiding this time? Drakos! Where are you? You scared? It's the calm before the storm. What's he reacting to? I don't know. Now we begin. You heard the man. Gear up. Cellphones on radio mode. Aye, Cap. I believe this is yours, Mr. Garan. I am not sure we should completely split up. Ren's right. We work as a unit. Or else he'll pick us off one by one. Oh, bugger that. See ya, kids. Let's go. Everyone still there? Barely. Let's... let's try to find our way back to each other. Fuck! How do we do that? We don't know where we are. Clear out each floor. Head down if you can. That is a lot of rooms. I wonder how long it took him to put this rat race together. I'm sure he took his sweet-ass time. And money. Obviously. He is not going to let us escape. That's the point. Just stay focused. Let's see if we can flush him out. Easier said than done. What happened to you, Asha? What turned you? You believed in the cause. When greed is your God, you can never be good enough. Not to beat me. Here we go. You're a really good assassin, Asha. Maybe the best, just not good enough. We'll see about that. Darkness makes you weak. Asha, Asha, what's going on? Like I said, not good enough. Garan, Asha. She's gone. I'll see you again, Asha. Someday. You went down the path of revenge thinking you were righteous. But you got lost, didn't you? Too many debts owed to the wrong people. You spilled a lot of innocent blood looking for me. Well, here I am, Mr. Ren. Drakos-san. We meet at last. Your tricks and illusions will not work on me. Oh, you have a very keen mind, just like your father, Sugahiro. Killed by your hand. I don't think you understand the true nature of the tetsu, right? You and I are very much alike. We are nothing alike. You kill for sport. I work for the end. And yet, here you are! Accepting my invitation... ...for sport. You have dishonored the tetsu and yourself. And tell me, how much did you honor cost? Ren. Ren! What's going on, Ren? Come on! Wait! Daddy, I'm scared. I miss Mommy. - Marcus? - Daddy! Ren. Now, that was a hell of a chess game. This was never a true chess game. You always controlled the board. That's why you, me, we're the last ones standing. You know the origin of the word "assassin," Mr. Garan? A thousand years ago, an Arab sultan employed hundreds of men to do his clandestine bidding. Dirty work. To keep 'em loyal and to trust them, he fed them cakes of hashish. He told them the euphoria that they were feeling, the high, was a little slice of heaven that they would experience if they died in his service. They were called the "Hashashins." Later, that evolved to "assassin." Now, isn't that fascinating? I appreciate the history lesson. You should enjoy this moment. This is the last bit of euphoria you'll ever feel. I knew it was gonna be you. I did. I always knew you were the one who had the skills to make it this far. I have a little confession too. There were a couple of times where, uh, you got the assignments and the contracts that I wanted. All this, all of this 'cause I beat you out of a contract? No. Of course not. But I do have an insatiable desire to be the best. Number one. My mother said I was too competitive. But you see now, I have the opportunity to prove that to myself, don't I? I never wanted this. Never wanted to be the world's best assassin, the King of Killers. What does that even mean? You know, it's like Asha said. Death is just part of life. So be it. Told you I was competitive. Let's talk about your wife for a moment. What was she doing there that night? How didn't you see her early? What could you have done to save her? If only you hadn't hidden all this from her. If you had told her the truth, she might still be alive. You carry the guilt of that night every second of every day. I know what it's like to lose someone close to you, someone you can never get back, how it could tear you. Yet, you still come here. And you risk leaving your daughter, making her an orphan. Why? To try and save the one you have left. But you have to kill me to do that. Before I kill you! The King does bleed. Die! Looks like we have a victor. Congratulations, Mr. Garan. The King of Killers. I believe this is yours. What's this? It's your prize. That card will give you access to a bank account in the Caymans. There's ten million dollars in it. You take care of your daughter. I need your help. You need my help? There's an international group of assassins that's ubiquitous and powerful. They can destroy the world. Creation of a new world order. That's why I killed all these guys. And what I want is a partner. Help me bring 'em down, someone better than me. You. What I want is to be with my daughter. There's a helicopter that will take you to the airport. I'll be in touch. Isn't pizza the best? I know. It's really good. Can I have another milkshake? - You know what? - What? I have an idea. - What is it? - How about we split one? - That's a great idea. - Right? - Yeah. - Yeah. Hey, kiddo. Yeah? Why don't you go play your video games? - Okay. - Daddy's got to talk to someone. Okay, Dad. - Marcus? - Eight p.m. at the Coal Train. I loved her like a sister. I told you you'd see me again. - This can't-- - It is. Sorry you had to see that. But it is real. Your best friend and mentor, that's how diabolical these people are. - Where'd you get this? - I have my sources. They cloned your phone. Sent your wife a text. That's what made her go to the club that night. These people who recruited your friend, they're the ones I told you about six months ago. They call themselves "Scimitar." Are you ready? I have to make some arrangements first. Then we go. Oh, and one more thing...
