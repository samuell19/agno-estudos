How good of you to join us, Miss, uh, Beckenham. Allow me to introduce myself. I am the "bloody idiot" who is running this court. If I might apologize, my lord. It's a little late for that. But perhaps you can make amends by telling me... where counsel for the defense is.[ Door Opens ] [ Man ] Right here, my lord. Me... Jack Sullivan. Mr. Sullivan, I trust you have a damn good reason... for being both tardy and cavalier with this court. My lord, I do apologize. I had an urgent ex partein the High Court. [ Whispering ] "Sex parte." Sorry, Miss Beckenham? Oh, nothing, my lord. Perhaps the charge could be read. Yes. [ Man ]Ernest Maxwell Coleman, you are charged with fraud contrary to Section... [ Whispering ] Jane, you are not going to believe this, but that's the weasel who sh... Shagged. Ellen last night. And nearly tried to proposition me over the breakfast table. I knew he was good, but I didn't realize he was that good. Good night? Yeah. Breakfast was a little tense. Don't tell me, after you slept with her, you didn't respect her. Didn't recognize her. Not guilty. [ Man ]Please sit down. If it please Your Lordship. Members of the jury, they say that fraud is a complicated business. I'm going to tell you why this man is a fraud... in 60 seconds. You see, it's very simple. The defendant took money. He promised to invest it and return it with a profit. Instead, he spent it. Complicated? I don't think so. Fraud isn't complicated, but defending fraud... that is. So don't be surprised when the defense tries to bury the issue... under a mountain of paperwork. Just remember, the only complex thing in this case... is the guilty complex the defendant should be suffering from. My lord, this should take about, um, two seconds. - We request an immediate adjournment. - What? [ Judge ]Clear the jury immediately. Alzheimer's? [ Jack ]The early stages, my lord, but nevertheless... sufficiently grave to render him unfit to plead. My lord, the defendant is 45 years old. I have reports by two of the country's top neurologists. Very well, Mr. Sullivan. It would seem we have no choice. I will adjourn the case for a date to be decided. However, on a more personal level, I should add that I consider your behavior outrageous, and that you are an absolute shower. Thank you, my lord. Just the sort of thing I used to pull when I was your age. Heathrow. Terminal 4. That's not our client fleeing from justice, is it? Of course not, Jack. He assures me this Swiss clinic is the only one that can treat him. Ah. That's all right. Oh, right. Gemini, huh? Miss Beckenham. I just wanted to congratulate you on that opening. It was brilliant. Well, for your information, I'll be applying for an expedited hearing. So I should hope. Your client can run, but he can't hide. I wouldn't be too sure about that. In my opinion, you have the morals of a shark... and the sex drive of-of... a rabbit. Really? I'd love to hear your reasons over a coffee, but I've got an 11:30. How can you have an 11:30? This case was set down for three months. It may have been three months in your diary. It was half an hour in mine. Oh, I think I'm free for lunch. You expect me to eat with you? Sorry about the case. You're obviously a good lawyer. And you're obviously a good crook. Fine. Give my regards to... Ellen. How can you not know her name? Having a bad memory doesn’t make you a bad person. Tell that to your Alzheimer’s patient and the people that he robbed. [ Cell Phone Rings, Beeps ] Hello? Hello, darling. No, everything's fine. It-It's just been postponed a little bit. It's perfectly normal. No, I'm not upset.[ Jack ] Oh, does this mean you’re free for lunch? No, I am bloody not! Ooh! No, I wasn't talking to you, darling. [ Kate ]So, shall we have "Jerusalem" for the final hymn? Yeah, fine. Or "Rock of Ages"? Just as you like. Or the Sex Pistols? Good. Never Mind the Bollocks? Sounds great. Oh, for God's sake, will you stop agreeing with absolutely everything I say? All right. I hope that was a joke. Look, Kate, I'm sorry you lost the case, but you'll have other ones. I did not lose the case! The case was adjourned! There's a big difference. Miss Beckenham, I'm afraid we have a problem. The record shows you've only eaten 22 dinners. Yes, that's right. You need 24 to use the church in templo "privitatus." In what? So if I have two more dinners, then we can get married? That's correct, but there's only one more dining evening before term ends. What if I double dine? The last day for double diningis three weeks afterSaint Barnabas' Day. - Which is? - Last Friday. [ Sighs ]So there's nothing I can do? Ah, well. Perhaps the register office. [ Stammers ] Actually, given this is a leap year, and therefore term was prorogued on Shrove Tuesday, the three-day rule does allow the undersecretary... to allow a double dining on a mooting evening, providing it's before Ascension. And is it? I haven't a clue, I'm afraid. But, um, Christmas falls on Sunday, which I always think is unfair. Uh... [ Kate ]So what you're saying is... if I apply to the undersecretaryunder the three-day rule... if such a day exists... and eat the dinners... and have the banns read on three consecutive weekends, then we can get married here? Couldn't be simpler. [ Camera Shutter Clicks ] All right, Kate. Jane, what are you doing here? I was just on my way home. Thought I'd pop in, see if you're okay. Oh, I'm absolutely fine. It's only a case, after all. I've got to keep these things in perspective. But after all the months of preparation... It's all water under the bridge now. Those working weekends... That's just the way it goes sometimes. Just to have some weasel screw it all up! I hate you, Jack Sullivan! That's it! Get all out! Bastard! All men are. Bastard! Except the father of my unborn child, who is a god, and whose fabulous body and agile mind I bow down and worship. Really? No, of course not, but it's a funny idea. [ Bottles Clattering ]Ellen, what are you doing here? Case of Vladi for you ladies. Vladi? Vodka. Go and get some ice... No! No, not in my chambers. Absolutely not. Go on, Kate. It'll do you good. What? No. Ice. Thank you. God, do I need a shot. I nearly broke my bloody back lugging this thing up here. You got fired from the wine bar? Yeah. Can you believe that?

Mirella!...relationship with your stepson? - [ Reporters Clamoring ]- I feel great. It's great to be back in London. [ Clamoring Continues ]Of course I am. Very confident. Coming through. Coming through. [ Female Reporter ]Are you happy it's over? [ Clamoring ]Turn this way, please, Mirella. [ Mirella ] Are all British attorneys as sweet as you are? Only the best.[ Laughing ] So how was New York? Oh, you know. Crazy. Crazy. Well, not too crazy, I hope. Come on, Tony. I'm not a nun. I know, Mirella, but until the trial, we'd appreciate it if you behaved like one. Who's "we"? Me and Jack Sullivan. He's your barrister. You mean one of those crusty old guys with the funny wig and weird clothes? Yeah. Cool. [ Laughs ] Mirella, I'd like you to meet Jack Sullivan. This is my barrister? You're not what I was expecting. Well, I do hope you’re not too disappointed. That's your British self-deprecating humor, isn't it? In America, we call that low self-esteem. [ Laughs ] Oh. [ Sighs ] [ Mirella ] So tell me, Mr. Sullivan, are we gonna win? Well, that's what we’re here to discuss. I'm afraid your late husband’s son has made some damaging allegations... about capacity and competence. Yeah, well, I guarantee you they’re all lies. I understand, Mrs. Burton, but we have to see how it looks to him. You were 21 when you met Mr. Burton, and he was... 75. Have you ever been in love, Mr. Sullivan? I'm afraid not, Mrs. Burton. Well, if you had, you'd know that age has nothing to do with it. It's something that just happens. I appreciate that, but I'm afraid his son doesn’t see the romantic side of the story. His son is a mean, devious scumbag. Which we will certainly endeavor to attest to. - Sorry, I don't speak law. - He said we'll nail him. That's right, but it's not going to be easy. Until Mr. Burton met you, his son was expecting... 15 million pounds and half a dozen properties. Look. It's not the money I care about, Mr. Sullivan. It's the principle. His son never loved him, and I did. Why should he be rewarded? Why? Mr. Sullivan? That's fine, Mrs. Burton. I have all I need for now. Where are you staying? A new apartment by the park. Hyde Park? No, Central. I'm sorry. I'm afraid I need you here in London until the trial begins. You're kidding? Well, I may need to see you or talk to you any time of day... or night. Really? I suppose I can live with that. Kate Beckenham. It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Burton. It's too girlie. Mr. Burton. Beckenham. Kate Beckenham. Yeah. This is it. I think I can safely say we have a strong case. I understand your concerns, but I'd appreciate it... if you'd let me lay them to rest. [ Phone Rings ]Ooh. Hello? Yep. Yep, Arthur. Send them in. Okay. [ Door Opens ][ Jane ]Thank you, Arthur. Um, Mr. Burton, may I present Kate Beckenham. [ Clears Throat ] Sorry. [ Chuckles ] Beckenham. Kate Beckenham. Hello, Miss Beckenham. I can safely say that I think we have a very strong case. Good. Good. Um, but there are a few questions I'd like to ask.Um... Oh, please, would you? Thank you. I understand your concerns, but I'd appreciate it if you'd let me lay you to... [ Stammers ] Them. Lay them to rest. Thank you. Um... Please don't think me rude, but I-I was expecting somebody... perhaps a little older. Ah. Of course. And please don't think I'm being rude when I say... isn't that the very same error your father made... mistaking a clever, determined woman for some silly young girl? Oh, Jane. I think we've found our counsel. [ Chuckles ][ Jane Chuckles ] [ Ticking, Chimes ] Thank you for seeing meat such short notice, sir. It was good of you.[ Door Closes ] You need permission to double dine so you can use the church for your wedding. Yes, that's right. Your fiancé is a lucky man. If that's all. No, as a matter of fact, it isn't. Perhaps there's something you could help me with. And what's that? Well, it sounds too juvenile to believe, but... a member of your chambers fired this through my window the other night. You wouldn't know anything about that? Not a thing.[ Clicks Tongue ] Shame. Well. I suppose I'll have to leave it in the hands of the police. The police? Criminal damage is a very serious offense. Yes, of course. On the other hand, I'd hate to see your chambers' reputation destroyed... by the stupidity and childishness of one of its members. I see. So what are you saying? Well, call me a great guy, but if you're prepared to go out for a drink with me after the dinner, I think I can forget all about it. A drink? You and me. Case closed. [ Rapping Stops ] [ Man Speaking Latin ] Amen.[ All ]Amen. Red or white? Red, please. Right. Who's in for the first drinking game? [ Man ]Good idea, Toby. Are you up for it? Oh, yes. Drinking till you vomit is an old favorite of mine. Ah, Sullivan! This Bordeaux is like your approach to litigation. Cheeky, too much fruit and far too buttery. Really, Your Honor? I was just thinking it was dusty, acidic, with an unpleasant finish. Just like one of your summings-up. [ Choking ] [ Man ]I'm not a pheasant plucker. I'm a pheasant plucker's son. And I'm only plucking pheasants till the pheasant...[ Continues, Indistinct ] [ Chattering, Laughter ] - And I'm only plucking pheasants till the pheasant...- [ Laughing ] [ Man ]No! I'm not the pheasant plucker! I'm the pheasant plucker's son. And I'm only plucking pheasants till the pheasant pluckers come. I'm not a pheasant fucker. I'm a...[ Gavel Raps ] [ Chattering Stops ] I call upon the master of the moot. My noble lords, fellow members, pupils. Tonight's moot is as follows. [ Laughs ] Forty percent of women barristers claim... to have been sexually harassed by their male colleagues. [ Applause, Whooping ] The proposition for the moot is that, in the words of the Immortal Bard, - "wethinks" the ladies doth protest too much! - Doth protest too much! - [ Laughing ] - [ Utensils Rattling ] What the hell does that mean? All women are begging for it! Who will argue the case? Good night. - You. - [ Whooping ] [ Utensils Rattling ] [ Moot Master ]You can act for the ayes. You must be joking. No member can refuse the moot master. Come along, young lady. What do you have to say for yourself? In this moot, fuck all! What'd she say?[ Cheering ] "Fuck all," my lord. I believe the undersecretary can argue the moot on behalf of anyone so chosen. Really? I could have sworn I saw her lips move. You stay out of this. Overruled, I'm afraid. Protest too much? Yes, my lord. Women do protest. They protest for a moment's relief... from our propositions and abuses. A female barrister is not a woman in a man's world. She's a woman in a little boy's world. [ Laughter ][ Utensils Rattling ] If she uses her sex, she's a slut.[ Murmuring ] If she doesn't, she's a fool. This place reeks of hypocrisy. One rule for men, another for women. The law... is the second oldest profession. And, yes, these inns are filled with whores plying their trade. But make no mistake. None of them are women. Thanks. For a complete hypocrite, you were quite good in there. Well, um, there's an explanation for that. You see, um, scientist shave started using lawyers... instead of rats for their research. Two reasons... One, scientists can get attached to the rats. - And, two, there are some things... - Rats won't do. So how do you feel about... dumping Graham and going out with me? And why would I want to do that? Well, we might have more in common than you think. Like what? What about hill walking? I like that. Really? You don't strike meas the hill walking type. Oh, no, I love it. Almost as much as I love show jumping. You're joking. I love that too. Hill walking and show jumping. I don't believe it. Isn't that amazing? No. I mean, I don't believe it. What did you do, look up my file and see what I put down on my scholarship application? [ Laughing ] All right. You believe in the jury system, right? Twelve people who know nothing about nothing... decide the fate of the accused. Yes.Fine. Good. - Excuse me. Do you think we make a good couple? - No! Jack! - In your opinion... - I'm not playing. Do we or do we not make the perfect couple? Not particularly. That's just one man's opinion. It's very important to get the woman's point of view. Excuse me, madam? Do you think that she should leave her fiancé and go with me? Does she love her fiancé? I'm not answering any of these questions. [ Man ] Is he really serious about you? I barely even know him. I am serious enough to ask a total stranger their point of view. Well, I think you should go out with him. Yeah. I mean, you fancy him. What? You have absolutely no evidence to support that. Well, if you didn't, you'd have walked out by now. That's a very pertinent point, and you're absolutely right. I'm leaving. Ah, no, you're not. Oh, yes, I am. I'm sorry. It's not up to us. The people must decide. Crucial question. Should she leave? [ Both Mouth Words ] [ All ] Yeah. [ Giggling ] The people have decided, Jack. Excuse me. That-That was a badly worded question. I have to say, if he's prepared to risk total humiliation... in front of all of us... [ Woman ] You should at least sleep with him. So, um, this case of yours... anything interesting? Oh, no. It's just a preliminary hearing on the Burton case. Really? Impressive. Um, it's just the next left here. Here? - Look, um... - Got any coffee? Yes, but you can't have any. You're right. That was a bad idea. Oh, I've got a better one. Jack. You definitely can't come in. I understand. Big day tomorrow. No. Graham's here. Ah. Graham. No, Jack. What are you... [ Clicks ] [ Door Closes ] [ Engine Starts ] Hello, darling.Hello. [ TV, Indistinct ] Isn't that the new SL? What? The, uh... The car you just came back in. Beautiful. I didn't notice, to be honest, Graham. Was it manual or automatic? I really don't know. See, maybe it was tiptronic. Graham, don't you want to know who drove me home? Sorry, darling. Of course. Who was it? Jack Sullivan. Really? Lucky bugger. Wish I had a car like that. Do you want me to stay tonight? Mr. Bunny needs a "huggle." [ Stomps Feet ] Look, because I've got such an important case tomorrow, do you mind if you don't? No, of course not, darling. We've got the rest of our lives together. Hmm. [ Sighs ] Hi. Hi.What are you doing here? I enjoyed last night. Yeah, it was good.[ Mirella Laughing ] [ Mirella ] This place is amazing. You are not serious. This is a law court? I was going to tell you last night, but I thought it might spoil the evening. You are completely unbelievable. Hey, last night was pleasure. Today's business. Don't make a big thing out of it. I will make a big thing out of it. Excuse me. The vampire's come out of her coffin. Hey, it's better than living under a stone. Mirella, I... Nice to see that you've found some young men... of your own age to play with, Mirella. Why have you shown up with a girl guide? What is... At least she has class, something that no amount of my father's money could possibly buy you. Maybe not, but it's gonna get me a shitload of other great stuff. Do you know what my grandmother used to say? She used to say, "America is made up of the sweepings of Europe." Gerald, eat me. If this... Oh, Mr. Burton... My lady, despite Mr. Sullivan’s usual deployment of smoke and mirrors, we submit this case cannot be dismissed at this stage. And furthermore, in light of our new allegation of fraud, we would like to ask the court for a jury trial. [ Woman ]Well, Mr. Sullivan, it seems that your opposing counsel has your tackle in a vise. Your Ladyship, with great respect, my learned friend is forgetting this case is set down in the Chancery Division, and therefore she cannot possibly have a jury trial. [ Kate ]On the contrary, my learned friend must be... forgetting Order 4, Rule 3, Subsection 1, which states the court can transfer us to the Queen's Bench Division... to allow a jury trial. [ Laughs ] In a vise and squeezing hard, eh, Mr. Sullivan? I'm afraid she's correct. I hereby rule that the trial by jury be arranged. [ Gavel Raps ] And may the best man win. Well done. I'm very impressed, Miss Beckenham. Well, don't start celebrating just yet. Perhaps not, but it will certainly wipe the smile... off that collagen-enhanced mouth of hers, won't it? Please. Is it just me, or did we just screw up big time? Right now, Mirella, I want you to go out there... and tell the whole world just how great this is. Think you can do that? No problem. [ Reporters Clamoring ]Miss Beckenham. Miss Beckenham. Any comment on today's judgment? Well, just that Mr. Burton now has the chance for 12 ordinary people... to decide this case, and that's great news for us. Thank you.[ Man ]This way, please. [ Clamoring Continues ] How are you doing, Mirella? [ Woman ]Are you angry at Gerald Burton? I don't have any comment. Leave it to my lawyers and my barrister. [ Clamoring Continues ] Mr. Sullivan, isn't this a setback for you? Not at all. Why don't I let my client speak on behalf of us all? Listen. I was raised in a democracy. Let the people decide, I say. I can't wait to tell the whole world how special our love was. Thank you. - [ Reporters Clamoring ] - Tell her I need to talk to her later. This is a fuck-up, Jack! Everything's fine, Tony. Better be. What is that supposed to mean? It means that she’s a fast learner. Tony, she has no idea what she's doing. We'll wrap this up in a day. [ Reporters Clamoring ] Hey, hold it right there. How dare you behave like that. Me? That's a joke. I'm not talking about that crap you tried to pull in there. I'm talking about last night and the fact you didn’t even tell me... you were on this case. My mistake. I can't believe you did that![ Horns Honking ] What's the problem? We had a nice drink, a pleasant evening, enjoyed each other's company. What's the problem? You lied to me. How about that for a start? I didn't lie to you. I merely withheld unimportant information. - A crime can be committed by act and omission.- [ Laughing, Chattering ] I don't understand why you're so upset. It's not like last night was the start of something. No, of course not.'Cause if it was, I'd feel differently. But we're just adults who felt a spark, acted on it, enjoyed the moment. Yes, of course, but... No, it wasn't like that. You're twisting it. Wasn't it? No. [ Honking Continues ]I mean, yes, but... No further questions, I think. [ Frustrated Stammer ] [ Honking Continues ] [ Cheering, Applause ] [ Man ] I would have tried a hook shot over a deep square leg... in spite of the possibility of a top edge to second slip. What about you? Something like that. [ Sighs ] [ Tony ]So I talked to our client this morning. Mm-hmm? She's anxious to see you in action. Give it a rest, Tony. I'm sorry, but I just don’t get it. Why haven’t you done the business? She's my client. So? It's never stopped you before. Well, I just don't want to complicate this case, all right? Yeah, but why? What's so special about this one? That's my business. And mine. I'm instructing you. If you want to go to the other counsel, that's up to you. It's okay. No need to get touchy.[ Jane ] So near. So near. [ Chattering Continues ]Well, look who it isn't. [ Jack ] Who?[ Tony ] Over thereby the sight screen. Your opposing counsel. What's her name? That's it. You're nearly... Kate.[ Jane ] That's it. Oh, well done, sweetheart. Kate? [ Kate Sighs ] I better get ready. Kate. [ Shouting, Indistinct ] [ Cheering, Applause ] Can I ask you a question? Yes, of course. What do you think of Graham? Oh. Well, nothing. He's your fiancé. No, I mean, what do you think of me marrying Graham? Oh. Um, uh, hold on. Good luck, darling! I think it's great. He'll make a wonderful father. Oh, just a sec. Straight back, Robin! Oh![ Cheering ] I shouldn't have said that, should I? No, no. I'm glad you did. You're right. He will make a good dad. Um, excuse me! Yoo-hoo! Yes, you. I'm sorry. My husband wasn’t really out then. I distracted him, so if we could just start again. Robin, get back in there! Oh. I'm sorry. You were saying? Oh, nothing. - Isn't that... - Jack. Jack. [ Applause ] Oh... So, the judge says to me, "So, Mr. Hampton, how do you propose to get around... Section 42, Subsection 5?" And do you know what I said? I have no idea. [ Speaking Latin ] [ Laughing, Continues In Latin ] [ Laughs ]What do you think of that? That's unbelievable. Excuse me. Wait a minute. Wait. You haven't heard my estoppel story. Hmm. [ Cheering, Applauseln Distance ] [ Murmuring ] See anything you like? Very little actually. Enjoy the game? I'd better go. You really want to go out there... and Toodle-oofor the rest of the night with strange little men? Don't. Why not? Because we're in court against one another tomorrow. Why let that get in the way? You're a professional. I'm a professional. We're professionals. That's right, and professionals don't let their feelings get in the way of the job. You're absolutely sure about that? Trust me. I'm a lawyer. [ Applause In Distance ]Kate? [ Cheering ] Kate? Are you in here? Yes! Are you all right? What are you doing here? I just spilled some wine on my skirt, and I was trying to wipe it off. Oh! You're looking very flushed. I hope you haven't had too much sun. [ Locker Closes ][ Laughs ] No. No, I was just... Are you all right? Are you okay? No, I'm having a terrible afternoon actually. Some twerp just tried to corner me with some estoppel story, and Robin's pissed, so I'm leaving. Do you still want a lift? Yes, that would be great. After you. After you. You're pregnant. Oh, yes. [ Locker Closes ] [ Kate ]You know that barrister you slept with last week? Yeah, sure. Uh, Edward. No. Jack. Jack. Short, stocky, hair-on-his-bum Jack? No, he was actually... he was tall, dark, sort of good looking. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Why? Well, um, I just wondered what, um, he... What? [ Stammers ] Um... Well, you know what I mean. No, no, no. Sorry. What was he like to... To shag?[ Laughs ] Yes.Yeah. I mean, I can't remember. It's not like I had the most gigantic, spine-slamming orgasm with him. They say that's...[ Clears Throat ] Which one of you is the bride? Oh. That would be me.Hi. Hi. Yes, well, that is something of a relief. Perhaps you could come and find me when the groom arrives. Certainly. I thought they liked sinners. What? Can you remember anything? Not really. I think he smelled nice. You are so annoying sometimes! What? Sorry I'm late, darling. Traffic was terrible. Have you been drinking? [ Laughs ]No. Look, Jack. I mean, the facts are still the same, aren't they? Yes, but a jury looks at them differently. And they'll look at you differently too. What you're saying is they'll see some scummy American... out to rip off their fellow countryman of his birthright. [ Chuckles ]I think that’s about right. Great.Look... The courts are like theater. Oh, you're telling me. It costs a fortune, and the seating's crap. No, Mirella, I'm serious. If you look the part, the jury will be more sympathetic to you. If you come in dressed like that, you're gonna make my job a lot harder. Okay, okay. I'll be discreet. [ Sighs ] You know, this may sound self-serving. I'm just gonna say it anyway. I did love my husband. [ Kiss ] Thank you, Jack. Did I by any chance just witness a breach of professional conduct? Sorry? Are you sleeping with your client, Jack? What do you care? I thought you were getting married. [ Retching ]Well, yes, I am. I am. I'm getting married to the most beautiful, [ Vomiting ] sensitive, caring man. Then why are you so upset about Mirella?[ Vomiting Continues ] No, I'm not upset. It's professionalism. Let's face it. You can't stand the fact... that she is a beautiful woman that men find unbelievably attractive. Please. Coupled with the fact that she's about to walk off... with 15 million pounds. Beautiful and rich... enough to drive anyone crazy. I can promise you that that-that... tartis not going to walk off with a penny of my client's money. Come on, Kate. You don't really think you can beat me, do you? [ Shutter Clicks ]Just watch me. [ Heel Breaks ] [ Woman On Radio ] Now at midnight 48, the shipping forecast... issued by the Meteorological Office at 23:58. Rockall, Malin, Hebrides, storm force 6, building 7, expected soon. [ Continues, Indistinct ] [ Sighs ] Surprise! I brought a little something for you. What is it? It's a Gonk. I had one for my A-levels. A sort of lucky charm. Oh, but you failed all your A-levels, darling. Yes, I know. But it was a great comfort. You're so sweet. Listen, how do I look? Not too, you know... Sexy? There's... something different about you. Really? [ Man ] All rise. That's me. I've got to go. [ Door Closes ] [ Judge ]Let's have the jury. [ Door Closes ]Members of the jury, the case you are about to hear may shock and disturb you. And of course, sexual intercourse with beasts of burden... is, thank goodness, relatively uncommon in this day and age. [ Whispering, Indistinct ] [ Clears Throat ]Please forgive me. - That is my case in Wales next week. - [ Snickering ] [ Whispering, Indistinct ] Happily, our case today... is altogether more civilized. Now let me just remind you that it is your duty... to listen carefully, decide honestly... and drink moderately. It works for me, and I am the judge. If it please the court... Excuse me, my lord. My learned friend appears to have dropped something. [ Spectators Chuckling ] I'm much obliged.[ Doll Squeaks ] [ Chuckling Continues ] Members of the jury, this is a story as old as they come. A rich old man in his declining years... falls victim to a ruthless and cynical gold digger. She persuades this old man... my client's father... to rewrite his will. She persuades him by the simplest... but most effective form of deceits... [ Paper Bag Rustling ]that of the heart. And by doing this, she deprives my client of his birthright. Lands and properties that have been carefully nurtured by his forefathers... have been snatched away from him by this young woman. In short, she has stolen everything he has. Members of the jury, he wants it back. [ Judge ]Mr. Sullivan. Love. Hello. I'd like to talk about falling in love. Because, you see, that's what this case is really all about... two people who fell in love. Now, it's saddening if his son feels aggrieved, and we can all understand that. But that doesn't entitle him to overrule his father’s wishes... merely because they don't benefit him. The law is quite clear. A person may leave his property to whomever he chooses, and Mr. Burton chose to leave his... to the woman that he loved with all his heart. [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ Gerald ]I was bringing the horses back from their afternoon exercise, and as I was passing the riding school, I heard them. "Them" being the defendant and your late father. That's right. And what were they doing in the riding school? They seemed to be struggling. And what was Mrs. Burton doing? She was pleading with him... telling him how much she loved him, that she adored him... and that he promised her he'd do it. And did your father say anything in response to this? He was saying that he couldn't do it, that it was wrong and that she shouldn't make him. [ Kate ] And what do you think this was all about? Well, it's obvious. It was about the will. I mean, three days later, he drew up that ridiculous document. Objection, my lord. I've let Mr. Burton go on, but this is quite ridiculous. I'm instructed by my client Mr. Burton's testimony... is a total distortion of what actually occurred in the riding school. If Mr. Burton heard anything, it was the sounds... of my client and her husband making extremely loud and passionate love. Counsel is being facetious now, my lord. Furthermore, I'm instructed Mr. Burton would have been totally unable... to hear anything from where he was standing. My lord, Mr. Burton has lived in this house his entire life. He knows what he heard. In that case, we request a visit to the farm at the earliest opportunity. Yes. Perhaps it would be best... if we visit the location. First thing tomorrow morning. Members of the jury, we will leave at 9:00 sharp. And you would be well advised to bring a packed lunch. In my judgment, sandwiches and a thermos of coffee would be sufficient. Or again, thinking about it overnight... and considering all the issues, some of you may wish to bring a chocolate biscuit. It is for you and you alone to decide. Now perhaps if you'd like to continue, Miss Beckenham. Oh, no! No. No, um... I believe that is a matter for counsel. I'm so sorry, my lord. My waters have broken. Where's Robin? He's on his way. [ Screams ]Ow! I need Robin. If anything goes wrong and Robin's not here, - I'll take it out on you. - That's okay. You'll never forgive me. Yes, of course I will. - I'll say terrible, horrible things about you. - That's all right. About your laughable sex life with Graham. About your obsession with Jack... and your squalid attempt to get off with him in the cricket changing room. [ Bell Tolling ] My lord, I'm so sorry I'm late. Never mind about that. What's the verdict? It's a little girl.[ All Exclaim ] [ Vehicle Approaching ] This is where Mr. Burton claims to have been standing... when he witnessed the events in question. [ Judge Continues ] Now the purpose of this visit... is to decide which version you believe... his or the defendant's. - This is ridiculous. - [ Sighs ] Blame your client. All right, you two. "Oh, please, I'm begging you. Begging." "I can't.It's wrong." [ Judge ] Get on with it. [ Shouting ] "I love you. I adore you. You're everything to me." "Stop. Don't make me do it." Yes, well, that doesn't sound like bonking to me. Therefore, I think whether you believe Mrs. Burton... is a matter of doubt. Thank you, Miss Beckenham, Mr. Sullivan. [ All Chattering ] [ Horn Blows ] [ Kate On TV, Indistinct ]Dad, what are you doing with the washing machine? There comes a time in every man's life... when he needs to put down some roots. Yeah, yeah. I won't be around forever, you know. I know, Dad. And I realize it’s my sacred duty... to continue the Sullivan line. But right now, I'm trying to win a case. She's beautiful. Who? Your opposing counsel. Think so? I do. And, um, I feel that... What do you think? Since when did you care about my opinion? Wear the aqua with the lilac. It brings out the contrast. [ Reporters Chattering ]How are you feeling, Mr. Burton? Fine, thank you. What do you think your chances? [ Jack ]Your father was a remarkable man, wasn't he? Yes. Decorated soldier, successful businessman, writer, painter, sportsman. He was accomplished, certainly. "Accomplished"? I'd say he was a man who chose to live his life to the full. Rubbish! He was a frail, confused old man... whom she made behave like a fool. Isn't that part of being in love? It's not rational. It's not sensible. It's not logical. That's what makes it love.[ Gerald ] If you say so. I do say so, and I say this. Love concentrates the mind wonderfully. It makes you think about what really matters to you in this life. That's why your father sat down and hand-wrote a new will. That's not true. I think it is. It may not be fair, but then love doesn't deal in fairness. Nor does lust or stupidity. Or envy or anger or greed... all of which you are consumed by, Mr. Burton. No further questions, Your Honor. [ Reporters Chattering ]Miss Beckenham! Miss Beckenham. Any comment? How's it going so far? [ Overlapping Questions ] Mrs. Burton, are you happy with today's developments in court? Yes, I am. I'm very happy. Do you think you're gonna win? I think so. I hope so.

Tell him I've gone out with Mike. I'd say Miss Beckenham's explanations left me none the wiser. [ Kate ] I'm not surprised, but at least he’s better informed. My lord, my learned friend seems to believe... if she asks the same question a variety of different ways, she'll somehow get the answer she wants. My lord, my client is entitled to a full exploration of the facts. Full exploration, by all means. Let's not make it an archaeological dig.[ Laughter ] Now, now, Mr. Sullivan. She must be allowed to develop her line in peace. [ Whispering ] Humbug. I agree. [ Jack ] Is learned counsel simply going to ramble on? No. Do you want one? We've all made love, even my learned friend. Thanks. May I remind my learned counsel... that my sex life is not the issue in this case. [ Jack ] Thank God for that. We'd all die of boredom. That is so typical of my learned friend’s entire approach to this case. If the law is on your side, you bang the law. If the facts are on your side, you bang the facts. If neither is on your side, you bang the table! And that is what he has been doing for the last 10 minutes. - I protest, my lord! - Objection! Now, now, you two. You're like a couple of ferrets in a bag. [ Spectators Laughing ] [ Kate ]Jack, look. Thanks. Owe you one. And furthermore, Mr. Justice Tomlin... was forced to intervene during the outburst... between Mr. Sullivan and Miss Beckenham. At one point, the judge remarked... that the case was becoming more like a spat between two lovers... than a reasoned argument between professionals. Both counsel vigorously denied this to be the case, each accusing the other of starting it. [ Laughing ] At this point, Mr. Justice Tomlin turned to the jury... and said, "Here we go again." And there was general laughter. The case continues tomorrow. This is Nicola Kent outside the Royal Courts of Justice. [ Kate ]Mrs. Burton, you say that you were completely in love with your late husband. I still am. Would you like to tell us what that feels like? Feels like? Yes. What does it feel like for a 21-year-old girl... to fall head-over-heels in love with a man... perhaps older than her grandfather? [ Scoffs ] Age has nothing to do with it. It's something that just happens. Could you please address your answers to the court... and stop playing to the gallery? Oh, so sorry, my lady. My learned friend. [ Laughing ] Okay. You all want to know? Fine. Fine, I'll tell you. It's a feeling of... of happiness. It doesn't go away... the knowledge that you'll be waking up next to this person... for the rest of your life. But you knew that you wouldn’t be waking up next to this person... for the rest of your life because he was nearing the end of his life. Mirella, perhaps you could tell us... what truly motivated your love for Mr. Burton. Objection, my lord. Objection sustained. Did your world explode every time he walked into the room? Yes. Did your skin tingle and your pulse race whenever he touched you? [ Gasps ] Yes. And when he kissed you, did you feel transported to another place, a higher consciousness? Oh, I did. Really? Because from where I'm standing, all I can see is a doddery old man... pathetically trying to cling onto the last vestiges of his powers. Oh, you're very cruel. No. You’re very cruel. You fooled an old man into believing that you cared for him, that you loved him. You took the most wonderful emotion a human being can feel... and you twisted it. You perverted it for your own avaricious ends. No. I did love him, and he loved me too. Oh, Mrs. Burton. There's not a shred of evidence to prove that this old man... felt anything other than confusion, delusion and fear. That is a lie! You're trying to make something that was precious... and special and wonderful... seem mean and cheap and cynical. Those are your words, not mine. Oh! It's so typical. You're so typically English, aren't you? You twist my words and emotions around. You're too cold at heart to actually experience them. That's not only a supposition, it's also irrelevant. [ Exclaims, Gasps ] You can just kiss my ass! It's all right, Kate.[ Shouting ] I'll not have this behavior in my court! Mrs. Burton. Mrs. Burton, you are in contempt! This isn't a court! It's a lynching! A lynching! Security! Mrs. Burton! I've seen animals treated better than this! - I loved my husband! - [ Mouthing Words ] My husband... I loved him! - I loved him with all my heart! - Order in the court! [ Gasping ] Miss Beckenham! Miss Beckenham! Any comment? Um, I think my client feels that the jury has seen through Mrs. Burton, and no amount of tears will wash that away. Can we expect a verdict tomorrow? Yes, I hope the jury will decide tomorrow. Kate, would you come round to the house this evening? We need to talk. Yeah? Okay.Thanks. [ Reporters Chattering ] [ Cell Phone Ringing ]Oops. [ Beeps ]Hello. Oh. Hi, Graham.

Members of the jury, I'm sure my learned friend will tell you how strange love is, how it plays to no rules and obeys no laws... and how it can happen to anyone, however unsuited they are. And I accept that this is a wonderful idea. It's a romantic idea.[ Zipper Unzips ] But that's just the problem, because that's all it is... an idea, a sentiment, a fantasy. It's not real. So let us deal with the real world. My client respected and loved his father. We say what has happened is wrong. We say that, in the real world, we must not reward fraudsters like Mrs. Burton... who use cheap words and perfunctory sex... to confuse and beguile a vulnerable old man. We say deliver justice to Mr. Burton... and give him his due. Members of the jury, I know I can trust you to be realistic with your judgment. Thank you. [ Judge ]Mr. Sullivan. My lord, I'd like to read some letters out to the court. My lord, I protest. What letters? [ Judge ] Yes, Mr. Sullivan. Perhaps you'd care to enlighten us. They are love letters from the late Mr. Burton to his wife. I'm sorry, but my learned friend cannot start introducing... new pieces of evidence at this late stage. - Well, Mr. Sullivan? - I would crave the court's indulgence. These letters only came to my attention this morning. Surely the court is not going to believe that. My lord, my learned friend has made great play of the fact... that there is no evidence to prove that my client and her husband were in love. Now that I have this evidence, she seeks to exclude it... on technical and procedural grounds. Either she's interested in justice or she's not. Which is it? Very well. I will allow these letters. [ Whispering ] You've got to do something. I can't, Gerald. I'm sorry. There's a legal maxim involved.

"I know that my life changed the day I met you... and that yours will change when I have gone." [ Burton's Voice ] ...have gone. Rest on the branch of my family tree. Enjoy the golden leaves of the autumn of my life. The girl who kept me warm in my final winter. Humor her, my loving wife... "who all the pain will fall to... when I am dead and gone."

And I told him about me and Steve, and he was so sweet. You know I need a little bit of stability in my life. Graham's someone l could rely on. Yeah, right.

[ Chattering ] Hold it right there. I can't believe you just did that. Did what? Gave me those letters, let me win the case. Why would I do something completely unprofessional like that? Because you believe in love. What? That's why you lost the case. You are a romantic. I did not lose the case. What are you talking about? Of course you did. No, no, no, no. I allowed you to win. I gave you the crucial piece of evidence. Without that, you had nothing. Wait a minute. I didn't need those letters. The jury were behind me all the way. Oh, come on.
