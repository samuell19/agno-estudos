This is where she did it. Right here in this room. The dorms were different back then, but the showers have always been the same. She ran a tap over her wrist, and then sliced it open with a razor. Then she lay her head back and drowned in her blood. They say her heart stopped beating at exactly three 3:13 A.M. Yvonne, what time is it? 3:12, one minute till. I don't believe any of this. Nothing's gonna happen. Well, kerrie, we'll know soon enough, won't we? It's exactly 3:13... Now. Are you ready? Edelvine ghost, rise up to us. Edelvine ghost, rise up to us. Edelvine ghost, rise up to us. Aw, what's the matter, kerrie? Forget the words? It doesn't matter anyway. It should still work for you all. She's supposed to appear behind you. Do you see anyone else in the mirror? See? Told you it wasn't real. It's just... did you guys hear that? Hey. Is somebody there? Alice? Don't. Now let's get out of here, please. funny. Which one of you guys did this? oh, my god! You guys fell for it completely. You guys are fucking assholes. Oh, come on, ros, even you can admit that was a good one. Oh, it was totally worth it. You were in on this, too, Bethany? It was Bethany's whole idea. Well, I mean, Alice came up with all the good parts. Well, partially I did, at least. Hey, so, where did kerrie go anyway? who's there? what now, Alice? Another dumb prank? No, that wasn't us. Right. I'm going to bed. You know what? I bet you're half right. Kerrie's screwing with us. She figured it out, and now she's just trying to get back at us. Come on. Kerrie? Are you okay in there? Oh, my god. “What? Oh, my god. Call... call an ambulance. Camille meadows. I see you've been at the top of our wait list for some time. You'll face a challenge since our classes are already underway. As one of the higher-ranked academies in the country, our climate can be quite competitive, especially among seniors like yourself. Even girls who entered as freshmen can sometimes find the stress of their last semester to be too much. I've worked very hard to be where I am right now, Mrs. Landry. That's good to hear. It's fortunate that a space has opened up for you here at edelvine. Yes. May I ask what happened? A girl here died? That's correct, I'm afraid. A terrible accident. Uh, one of our students slipped and fell from her window. The poor thing. Tragic. Well, then, I'll have helina, our student aide, show you to your room. You sure you don't need any help? I got it. Supper's in the dining hall at 7:00. You're gonna want to be on time. The tables can be a bit cliquish, but I'm sure you'll figure it out. Curfew's every night by 10:00, so make sure you're back in your room, in case Mrs. Landry decides to check. All that's in your orientation pocket, but it can be a lot to digest, especially considering I'm sure you already have a ton of catch-up work to do. This is your room. The girl who died... This was her room? Yeah. Kerrie Riley. She lived here. All the other rooms are full. But, um, hey, why don't you come find me in the study lounge once you've finished unpacking? We could go over your class schedule together. I'd really appreciate that. perfect. Hey, this is our table. Scram. - Your table? - Uh, yeah. My name's Camille meadows. I'm new here. I didn't ask, because I don't care. This 1s our table, and everybody knows that. Move. - No, I'm good here. - You're really not. Look, um, I get that you're new here, so you don't know us yet, but you really don't want to get on our bad side. Why's that? You guys seem so nice. Um, Camille. Let's go sit somewhere else. Oh, helina's already made friends with the retarded new girl. Why am I not surprised? Shut up, Yvonne. I'm just... Hey. What's going on here? The new girl wants to sit at our table. It's true. It's good conversation. Sure. I mean, we do have an extra chair now, don't we? And you already took kerrie's spot in school, so you might as well take her study lounge seat, too. Thanks, Alice, but it's fine. We'll just go sit somewhere else. So... What's your name? Camille. Well, I'm Alice. And you've already met lenora and Yvonne. This is Bethany. And over here... oops. Oh, my god. I am so sorry. Looks like you're gonna have to go get changed. Go on, get the fuck out of here. stop! stop that immediately! Ugh! All of you to my office. This instant. Are you certain you don't want to tell me who started this fight? It was just a little misunderstanding. I can't say you're off to the best start here, Ms. meadows. I hope you don't make me regret our decision to enroll you. Now, unless one of you girls tells me who was responsible for this altercation, I'm afraid I will have no choice but to punish you all. Fine, then. You're dismissed. Tomorrow's a new day. You fucking joking? Hi. I got a maintenance request for this room. - Just one moment, please. - That's okay. I'll, uh... No problem. So, you're the guy around here who fixes stuff? Yeah, I guess that's me. Janitor, handyman, et cetera. Uh, really just those two. So, you put a request in the maintenance box yeah, that light keeps flickering. Or at least it was last night. I'm new here. Yeah, I heard. Uh, nice to meet you. My name's Trevor. Camille. On. It must be the ghost again. No, this building's supposed to be haunted, you know? Isn't every old school building supposed to be haunted? Yeah, each school probably does have its own stories, but this one especially used to freak me out when I was a kid. You grew up around here? I did. You've undoubtedly met my mother, Mrs. Landry. Your mom's the head mistress”? Mm-hmm. Yeah, she moved here to start teaching when I was 5. All my babysitters growing up were students, so I know all the best edelvine ghost stories. L, um... I've got to go to class. So 'll just let you... Yeah, no problem. Is everything else okay? Um, I think the window might be loose. I kind of felt a little draft last night. Okay. I'll take a look at it. Uh, I meant... Oh, that's just... - it's just an accident. - Well, be careful out there. Let me know if you need anything else. In the Noh drama style, women were barred from participation onstage. Their lead roles were acted out by male performers wearing masks, not entirely unlike those that you each designed for yourselves. Camille, I was hoping you could tell us the name of the first acknowledged female performer in english theater. I'm not sure. Margaret Hughes, who took the stage on December 8, 1660. This was in your reading. I understand it will take some time for you to catch up with the rest of the class, but it might help to keep your eyes forward while I am speaking. Now, before we finish today, as you recall, last semester, you each submitted essays to the Ivy gate fellowship competition. I am very proud to announce that one of our own students, Bethany, has won first place, with a prize of a $250,000 college scholarship. - You didn't tell me that. - Her winning essay will be featured in the next issue of the edelvine gazette. And I suggest you all read it to learn from her example. Class is dismissed. As for those of you with detention, Mrs. Landry has asked that you meet her in the library. in order to make our entire storage collection searchable online, a good deal of archiving and scanning will have to be done. And I have decided that you will all have detention each and every day until this project is completed to my satisfaction. I know you girls are dealing with a lot right now, but we do not tolerate any physical altercations here at edelvine. If you can all manage to work together as a team, I'm sure you'll get through this quickly. This is gonna take forever. Thanks a bunch, new girl. Her name is Camille. And also, how is any of this her fault? - You and Alice started it. - I shouldn't even be here. I didn't do anything. Shut up, Bethany. You just got a quarter-million- dollar scholarship, so you can stop freaking out about your transcript. Whereas I have a recital next week - I should be practicing for. - Okay, well, you know what? I think we all should've gotten a pass this semester 'cause of kerrie. Okay, I don't mean to be harsh, but aren't you supposed to get an automatic 4.0 if your friend dives out a window? I think that's only if you're roommates. As much as I'd love to spend my last semester listening to our complain, I suggest we put all our differences aside for now, and like Mrs. Landry said, get to work. Agreed? I can start looking for those books in storage. If someone shows me where that is. Yeah, I'll come with you. Um, okay, next one is 115.25. Okay, I'm gonna go take these up front. Um, you happy to start on the next shelf? Yeah. helina? Wow. Well, if you can't have fun in detention, when can you have fun? Hilarious. Yeah, you like? We made masks of our faces in theater tech. I did such a good job. Can you even tell I'm wearing it? Oh. oh, hi, helina. We were just having fun with your new girlfriend. You know, one of these days, you two are gonna mess with the wrong person. Maybe. Not today, though. Oh, no. Are you mad at us, helina? Oh! Boo-hoo! Sorry about them. I'd say they're better once you get to know them, but they're not really. If anything, they've gotten worse since, um... Since kerrie died. Did you know her well? Yeah, we used to be close. My first year here, but, um... We... we grew apart. Kerrie started hanging out with Alice and the others, and then she just didn't have time for me anymore. I'm sorry not your fault. What happened, exactly? I'm sorry. No one's told me. Some people think it was an accident. I heard a rumor that her parents want to reopen the police investigation. What do you think? I think it's easier to believe almost anything other than that someone we were close to was in pain and we didn't notice. So, I-l don't know. Guess we'll never really know for sure. What if I told you there's a way we can find out? What are you talking about? Come, I'll show you. So, we've been talking about doing something like this anyway, and then Bethany found this ritual online. It's in Latin. So, you're gonna do a seance. In here. To contact your friend. This is really fucked up. What is your problem, helina? If it doesn't work, it doesn't work. Worst-case scenario, nothing happens, right? And I mean, don't you want to know why kerrie did what she did? I'm in. Why not? Sounds weird. Besides, I'm not working in here while you all take a break. Okay, fine. I guess if you're all really doing this... Grab a chair, then. Where's, uh... what's her name? Oh, lenora said she wasn't feeling great, so we shouldn't wait for her. There's someone hiding in that corner. - How... how did you... - They're trying to scare us. Just play it cool. So, is this what you all do for fun here? To be fair, we don't have a ton of options. Okay, then. Fine. How does it work? Well, first, you need a planchette, like a writing tool. Alice had a great idea for that. Neat, huh? Okay, so, we've got to concentrate our energy and maintain contact with the, um, planchette here. You guys ready? Is that it? So, what happens now? Wait, I guess. For how long? Wait. Okay, I... Who's doing that? "Me. N okay. Spirit, is there anything you want to tell us? Hold on. This is... Shh! Ros. "Ghost is real." What... what is it talking about? Oh, come on. You didn't seriously think this would scare us, did you? Quiet, helina. We're not doing this. This is too weird. No, wait. We shouldn't break contact. Seriously? Yeah. We should keep going, right? Spirit, with whom am I speaking? Kerrie. Is it actually her? - You all really are sick. - What the fuck is going on? I can't believe that even you would sink this low for a joke. Okay, what... what's that supposed to mean? W-who is going to kill us? "She is." W-who is she, kerrie? Who do you mean? - "Her?" - She's talking in circles. Maybe being a ghost is confusing. "She is here." I... So, what was that in there? It seems like you should tell us. It was supposed to be a joke. We were gonna move the planchette around, draw a pentagram with the lipstick, and then lenora was gonna jump out and scare you. Would have been really funny. Yeah, it would have. But that wasn't us. I honestly figured it was one of you two who was doing it at first. What, you really expect me to believe that we just talked to kerrie's spirit? I don't know. I really did read that incantation. On the site where I got the ritual, it said that you could only contact the spirits of people who died somewhere nearby. We really did the summoning, too. The edelvine ghost, that night with kerrie... We said the words at the right time. The edelvine ghost? It's just an old legend. Some girl supposedly killed herself in the dorms years ago. Story goes, if you call to her, she appears, and then... - Then you die. - Yeah, but it's not real. And, I mean, no one's stupid enough to actually try it. On. The night kerrie died, it really was supposed to be a joke. Then she ran to her room, and that was the last time any of us saw her alive. Hey, so, I honestly couldn't hear or see anything from over in the corner. Can somebody tell me what happened? Are you okay? I guess. I mean, that had to just be an awful fucking joke, right? Maybe. They seemed pretty Sincere. Yeah, they're good at that. It's the same joke they played the night that kerrie died? I just know I don't trust any of them. no idea how I meet these guys. Last guy who messaged me just wanted pictures of my feet. Uh, I'll just catch up with you guys in a bit. - Okay? - Are you sure? Yeah, it's cool. What the. .? Is somebody there? Okay, come on, if this is somebody playing a joke, it's really not funny. Fuck... Camille? Um, yeah”? Come in. Hey, um, I printed those renaissance notes I was telling you about. Oh, thank you. That's really... Super helpful. Thanks. Helina? Do you mind me asking, the girl who lived here, kerrie... What was she like? Are you worried your room is haunted now? I don't know. My grandmother used to say that if someone dies in a really horrible, like, bad way, the energy imprints on the surroundings. And if you're sensitive, you can pick up on it, like playing back a recording. Look, even if kerrie was here in some way, she... Kerrie was a good person. Okay. Thanks. And a tendu, close. Shape the arm, and in. Degage, degage, pique, and close. Pas de cheval, and in. And side, and in. And back, and in. And seven, and eight. And a-one, and a-two. Balance, and four. And five and six, and developpé. Chassé, grand jeté. Yes? What? No. No, she isn't. Hm. That's all for today. Good work, everyone. Alice, Bethany, Yvonne, rosalind, Camille... After you've changed, please come see me in my office. Camille, just one moment, please. Your transcripts say you undertook ballet at Brighton. Is that accurate? Of course. Huh. I'm sorry. I... I didn't sleep very well last night. And I have cramps. Ah. I truly hope to see some improvement from you shortly. Now go get dressed with your friends. They're not my friends. So, you're telling me that none of you have seen or heard from lenora since supper last evening? No, she wasn't at lunch or in class. And she didn't say anything about perhaps traveling somewhere, anything like that? I've been texting her all day, but I think her phone is off. And I went to her room before lunch, but her door's locked. Yes, a staff member checked lenora's room this morning when she wasn't in class. Almost all of her personal items are missing. We've spoken with her parents. They're trying to locate a young man she's become acquainted with online. Wait, you think lenora ran away from school? She would never do that, Mrs. Landry. I mean, definitely not without telling us. Which is exactly why I've invited you all here. I can assure you that any information given to me will be passed along in confidence. Her parents just want to know she's okay. So do we. Yeah. This doesn't even... Mrs. Landry, we honestly don't know anything. But I don't think lenora would just take off like that. I can see that we're getting nowhere. But please, if any of you girls should suddenly recall anything at all regarding this matter, please let me know. You're dismissed. Why are old people so stupid? Your brain cells die after you turn 30. I read that. There's no way lenora just bailed on us. Mrs. Landry said all her stuff was packed and gone. That's just not possible. Mrs. Landry's son, Trevor, he's like the handyman around here, right? Would he have a key to her room? I guess so. What are you doing? Texting him. How do you have his number? - He gave it to me. - Well, that's just impossible. Because he doesn't talk to us students, like, ever. great. He's gonna meet me in the dorm. What's got you playing detective? You don't even know lenora. Why do you care what's happened to her? I don't. But whatever it is, I don't want it to happen to me. Come with us. Or don't. Up to you. So, when you said you wanted me to meet you here, that was kind of like a plural "you," huh? Sorry. It's important. Well, it better be. Could get in trouble for this, you know? We won't tell anyone. We just want to see in her room. Her suitcase is gone. Yeah, I assume that's the kind of clue they'd look for. Seems like she packed in a hurry. Her room's always kind of like this. There's a hidden space behind the top drawer, in case you get a room search. You didn't see this. I'm not even here. I don't think she would leave without this, would she? Can I see that? Well, we should probably get out of here, so if you're all finished... Yeah, I guess. Lenora made her bed? The police are on their way. They've told me that they'll have the substance on lenora's bed analyzed to determine if there's any cause for real concern. Cause for real concern? Mrs. Landry, our friend's disappeared, and there's a cross drawn in blood on her bed. As I said, Bethany, the police are on their way, and I'm sure they'll take this quite seriously. L, for one, just hope this isn't a waste of their time. To me, this appears to be exactly the sort of prank lenora and you girls love to play. - We wouldn't... - We shall see. As for you, Trevor, we'll discuss this matter later. Wait for me at home. Whatever's going on here, I'm sure there's no need to impress upon you how bad it would be for rumors to circulate. If I hear any gossip regarding this matter, I will know its source. The police will be here shortly, and I will apprise you of their findings, but if this turns out to be one of your jokes... To that point, shouldn't you all currently be in detention? This is it. I think I found her. Alicia Kane, daughter of Noah and Ethel Kane. Born February 24, 1982, Gridley, Illinois. Died October 13, 1998, at edelvine girls academy. Funeral service will be held... Is that it? They won't say suicide in obituaries. I wouldn't expect any more details. How do we know it's her? We don't. But, um, I did an obituary search online, and this was the only listing I could find for a student who died here at edelvine. I mean, aside from kerrie. 1998, right? - So, that's the edelvine ghost? - Wait, look at her necklace. It's the same cross. That's her, but... Now what do we do? Better hurry, ros. Past 10:00. hey, someone's still in here! Assholes. Shit. excuse me, please, everyone. As some of you may have heard, I have tragic news. One of your classmates, rosalind Carlisle, passed away tonight. I've just spoken to the coroner, and it would seem that she somehow fell in the shower. For now, I'll ask you all to please return to your rooms. Hey, Camille, are you in there? Hey, um, il just heard the awful news about rosalind, and I wanted to, um... J-just check and make sure you're okay. Thanks. Yeah, I'll be fine. Are you sure? I... I have some Xanax, if you need anything. I-I've just been taking them to sleep since... Lately. No. Thanks. Okay. Um... Good night, then. Hey, um, do you want to hang out here for a while? Rosalind. It doesn't make any sense. How so? For her to fall in the shower. I mean, I know stuff like that happens, but, like, only to really old people, right? Maybe I do believe in ghosts. There have been times in here when I felt like someone was watching me, but there was no one there. You know? You're kind of freaking me out. Sorry. Me too. I think I'm pretty high. Hang on. I want to give you something. Camille, you didn't have to. Okay. What is it? keep it. If anything scares you, hit it in the skull. Don't you need it? No, I've got other stuff. Okay. Um... Thank you, Camille. No, mom, I'm fine. I'm just... We're all just really upset. Ros was... No, no, I don't... I don't need you and dad to come here. I just wanted to hear your voice. No, it won't affect my grades. I'll study, mom, I promise. Yes. I need to go to bed now, okay? I'm really tired. You too. Okay, good night, mom. Good night, Mr. bear. wait, what? She was in my room. Check the closet. O-okay. What's going on in here? We don't know. We just got here. She... she was right over there. Tell me exactly what happened, Bethany. I... I heard a voice in my room, and it was the edelvine ghost looking right at me. And I threw my lamp at her... The edelvine ghost. Not that nonsense again. Think logically, Bethany. Where were you when you saw this ghost? You were asleep in bed. I wasn't asleep. I'd just turned out the light. Bethany, you've had a bad dream. It's entirely understandable under the circumstances. I-I was wide awake. I swear. Everyone return to your rooms. I know this has been a terrible evening, but you need to get some rest. You can stay in my room tonight, Bethany. That's okay, right, Mrs. Landry? Yes, fine. Just for tonight. Helina, what are you doing on this hall after curfew? I-I was just making sure that Camille was okay. What are you doing here, Mrs. Landry? Rosalind's mother asked me to pack up some of her things. Her family will be here tomorrow, and I've offered to help. Now, all of you, back to your rooms. I just need to pack a bag, Yvonne. I really think we need to tell someone what's going on. Tell them what? That we conjured a ghost and now it's killing us? No one will believe li. Well, I'm not sure / believe it. Whatever was in Bethany's room, she scared it off. I just... don't understand that. I guess it's difficult to say why ghosts do what they do. Are you two high? Where's Alice? I haven't seen her tonight. I don't know. I guess she slept through everything. Um, we shouldn't wake her up now. I'll tell her in the morning. Okay. Be careful. You too, I guess. great, you're finally here. We're gonna try and contact rosalind. What, right now? We should do it when her spirit might be near. She could have a message for us. If you don't want to, fine. Okay, so should we should all focus our thoughts on rosalind. fuck off. rosalind? Is that you? Do you have a question for her? Rosalind, hey. We miss you. Rosalind, how did you die? What happened? "Murder." Did the edelvine ghost kill you? What does she mean? Rosalind, who killed you? Was it... Camille? What the fuck? This is fucking bullshit. One of you is doing something to... Camille! Wait. Wait! Maybe ros was saying something else! Seemed pretty fucking clear. Are you fucking nuts? Stay away from me. Get the fuck away from us. - We should tell someone. - Tell them what? Look, I'm sorry, Camille. I admit, I don't know what's going on here. And if I'm wrong, then I'll apologize. But in the meantime, I'm texting my friend back home and I'm telling her that if anything bad happens to me, Camille meadows did it. Yeah, good idea. I'm gonna text my brother. Text the FBI for all I care. I didn't touch rosalind. Why would I kill her? You got into a fight with her. I got into a fight with you. Is that a threat? you should text someone, too, Yvonne. Maybe we should call the police, leave an anonymous tip. That way, we don't have to explain, just in case. Yeah, that's a good idea. W-where are you going? - I need to go to practice. - Right now? Yeah, I-I just want to think about some things. I'll catch up with you guys later. J because baby's gone j j and the train won't come back j j until I've cleaned up my act and my style j j the country is clean, and with sheer irreverence j j I'll take penance, I do it so well and the way j j that the friends of the heroes can tell j j 1 do it so good j j so good j j ah, ah, ah, ah j j ah, ah, ah j J in high Eve snow j ji'il call & who's in here? You? Go away. You're not supposed to be here anymore. You're not alive. you're not supposed to be here. My room is definitely haunted. Can I sleep with you tonight? Um, yeah, sure. Thanks. Yeah. No problem. I took a couple pills, so I'm probably gonna pass out soon. Cool? What? What the fuck, Yvonne? Yvonne? Where the hell are you? Lenora? What the. .? Yvonne, what the fuck? She'll scream. No one can hear us back here. Scream all you want. Fine. Suit yourself. There's not much need for masks anymore. I like wearing it. You two... Killed kerrie? Kerrie? Yeah. Yeah, and rosalind. And Yvonne. And lenora. Fuck this. oh, yeah. She's dead, too. Technically, uh, I killed them. I-it's true. Kerrie? Are you okay in there? Trevor knows how to make crawl spaces in these buildings. He's been at it for years. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Call an... call an ambulance! Why? Did you hate them all that much? Yes, I did. But no, I only did it because I had to. I honestly never expected that scholarship essay to win. I didn't have time to write my own, so I just copied one of kerrie's depressing stories, just retyped it. When I found out it actually won, I thought I was fucked. Not only would I lose the scholarship, but I'd be expelled for plagiarism. My whole life gone. Unless... The problem was, once kerrie was dead, I realized I had to kill the others, too, because if they actually bothered to read it once it was published, they'd know it was kerrie's. They could put it all together. So I just had to keep them distracted. Enter the edelvine ghost. The funny thing about those pranks we used to play is that the girls were actually very superstitious. So I moved the planchette. I put a magnet in my phone case for the big stuff. And if I had been caught, I would have laughed it off. But no one did. And after that, no one was thinking clearly about anything. Trevor had already helped me there before we even met. Didn't you, babe? Alicia Kane. She used to babysit me when I was a kid. She was a real bitch. When I was 12, I snuck into her room just to scare her. She really freaked out. So I hit her with my hammer. Then it wasn't too hard to drag her to the bathroom, cut her wrists. I think my mom might've guessed. I've been more careful since then. It was just a dream. When we found that picture of her wearing that necklace, Trevor had the idea to put the blood on lenora's bed. Not many girls would appreciate someone with a unique mentality like Trevor. We've had to keep our love secret since my freshman year. But not much longer. Freshman year? So you were 14. Gross. Can I kill her now? Not just yet. It's for the medical examiner. While I'm here, I might as well take this. Do you think I didn't see your shoulders moving? Come on, it's amateur hour. Use this to kill Alice. More evidence. god must truly be on my side. Right when I was trying to figure out how I was gonna pull this off, the weird new girl shows up, picks a fight publicly with all the victims. With Alice and Yvonne's text messages about you, plus the evidence we'll plant in your room, I don't think the police are gonna look too closely at this. I mean, helina might not buy it. But when she commits suicide in a day or two, everyone will understand. It's just more tragedy. If you touch helina... You'll what? Be dead? this has been tremendously satisfying, but it's time to wrap it up. Go ahead, babe. Alice first. what? Oh, you're so fucked. Hey, since you decided to frame me for a series of murders, did you bother to look me up at all? I did. And you're not on social media, which is weird... But I bet you did find a Camille meadows, though, right? Lives in Florida, gets good grades. Went to Brighton for ballet. You're not you. Hey, I'm a little lost here. Can somebody loop me in? I don't get it. Why? I came to this school... To pay off a debt. And how's that going? Could be worse. Where's the breaker? By the back door. Stay here. Hey, Trevor. Last chance. Untie me, and maybe you can go to hospital instead of prison. Yeah, you know, my mother sent me to therapy a few times. I always got along fine with the therapists. Good listeners. No, thanks. I like it out here. I'm supposed to kill her first. Some forensics thing Bethany's got figured out. But... You know, I bet if I cut you now, she'd make it work. She always does. Hold on. Please don't do this. Hit him again. Good. Untie me. Are you okay? I am now. How'd you find us? I-I'll tell you later. You're hurt. I'm fine. Did you call the police? No, I left my phone in my room. Is she... is she dead? No, she's just knocked out. Help me untie her. Okay. We're gonna have to carry her. Through the library. Hey, Walt. Where you girls going? Fucking useless. you can't run from me. You shouldn't have killed my friend. Kerrie. Hi, Alice. What happened? Bethany and Trevor killed everyone. So, there... There wasn't a ghost? No, I think there is a ghost. The ghost just didn't kill your friends. You're... you're alive? Careful. You have a concussion. You know, I think we all do. But can you walk? Is... is Bethany... She's dead. I'm gonna need you both to go back to the dorm and call the police. Wait, you're not coming with us? Trevor's still back there. I'll tie him up and wait here for the cops to come. I'll see you when they get here, okay? You had to kill Bethany, huh? Literally the only girl I ever got along with. There's nowhere to escape to. I already locked the back door. Doesn't matter if your friends bring help. No one will get here... In time. hey. You under there? aah! Aah! My leg. It's broken. Should've killed you earlier. Guess I'll be going to that loony bin, after all. Maybe my mom can pull a few strings, get me out in a couple years. how many friends did you have growing up, Trevor? I don't know. I just had one. Whoa! I thought you might try something like this. You killed him, didn't you? Of course. Alice told me what she heard. You... you did this all for kerrie. Kerrie and I grew up together. I owed her a lot. She killed herself. I wanted to know why. I called the police. They're gonna want to talk to you. Well, I might be hard to find. I'm not Camille meadows, helina. I just used that name to get in here. Now I'm done. Gonna find another name for a while. So, I'm sorry, but... I'm afraid you'll have to explain things for me. What, so that's just it? You're leaving? I mean, w-what am I supposed to tell everyone? Tell them whatever you want, helina. I don't care. Then how will I be able to reach you? I mean... If I wanted to. I'll find you. but I really have to go now.
