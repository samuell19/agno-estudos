Elizabeth! Are you alright? Elizabeth? Elizabeth! Mrs. Childers, check her pulse. Up it 20 percent. No... Up 20 percent. Elizabeth, listen. We're going to try this again. I need you to tell me why you started the fires. Elizabeth! I know you can hear me. Why did you start the fires? Nurse Childers... ...give her a sedative. Elizabeth! You have to stop! Stop please! Hi. Hi! Go ahead and give us your name, age, and where you're from. I'm Chris Mitchel, I'm 27 years old, and I'm originally from Spokane, WA. Hi, my name is Callie Brooks, I'm 25, and I'm from San Diego, CA. Um, Angelina Becker, and... I'm 23. I'm from Costa Mesa, CA. I think that people deserve... ...a realistic portrayal of what actually goes on with the paranormal. I would love to actually go in there and see for myself you know, and not read about it. Shit! Shit, shit, shit... Try the front door! I think that the premise of the show is great. And I'd love to be a part of it. Fuck! Come on! Did you fucking see that? Did you see that? What the fuck was that?! Chris! Chris... - Fuck! - Shh, shh... It's okay, it's okay. That's ok? Are you fucking out of your mind? Shh! Calm down, calm down, calm down. Calm down, okay? It's gonna be fine. We're gonna be fine, I promise. Fine my ass! She just got whipped into nothing! Nothing! I know! This is a bad dream, this is a bad dream... Come on. Ok, what the fuck are we doing? Do you remember anything? ...we'll break for it. Yes. We're gonna go straight for the window. - Please be careful. - Stay close! Go, go, go! Hey! Stop! Shit! Is that a good thing or a bad thing? What? What's what? Oh My God! What are you doing? I'm filming. I'm a cameraman. It's what I do. Okay, but you're supposed to film the cast. Are we gonna be waiting for that much longer here? I don't know! We're just waiting on Chris, and Callie, and Angelina. Mmm. Hey Andrew! How we doing with all the uh... ...high tech nerd gear stuff? I think we're pretty much all set, man. Groovy. You don't have to film this. I'm filming everything, buddy. What is the hardest part of shooting a shitty, cheesy, low rent, ridiculous reality show? I'd say the hardest part of my job, is getting everyone else to do theirs. You look very pretty on camera, by the way. Oh our first actor's here! Yeah, I'm not late, am I? No! You're the first one here. Ah, I'm excited. This is... uh, this is it, huh? Yeah! We got the whole R.V. here and everything if you- Oh that thing is awesome! - Yeah! Go hang out. - Chris right? Yes! - Hey, Jeff. - Jeff, nice to meet you man. I'm excited to be working with ya. So with cameras, we got some static cams, we got tripods all loaded up. We got some extension chords and lights for the nighttime stuff. Yeah, great, great, great. Good. Hello ladies! Hey Jeff. This is Jeff. - Hi. Angelina? - Yeah. - Hi Angelina. - What's up? I was just telling her I think the trip is gonna be pretty awesome. Angelina, you want to say anything to the camera now? Uh, yeah, not, no- Not so much. Not yet. - Well we got a shy one! - We do have a shy one. Oh, hey Chris! Why don't you put all that back where you found it? For a sec. - Yeah! - I'm trying to load everything up. I'll teach it all to you later, I promise. - Cool. - It's exciting! Yeah, I think it's gonna b- - How long is this drive Becka? It's about... Nine hours isn't it? Nine, ten hours. Yeah. Well we better get going. What we waiting for now? Hi! I'm Callie! I'm so sorry I'm late. Hi Becka! Hi! Nice to see you. Let's hug it out. Yeah, nice to see you. Thanks for coming. My roommate dropped me off and we got lost, and we got lost and everything... - Totally fine. Totally fine. - I'm so sorry. - Is everybody here? - Yes! But it's all good. It's all good. Let's get your stuff in the car. - Hi Callie, I'm Jeff. - Hi Jeff! - We're off! Woo-hoo! - We're off! Here, step up in front of this, um... ...uh let me get the waterfall back here a little bit. And try not to get hit by a car. Yeah, ha, that'd be good. So did you ever do, um, like one of these shows before? Like reality shows? Um, I've never done, I've never shot a rea-Woah! Yeah, I did shoot a reality show actually... I did shoot one before. I did like some, uh, pet shot. Celebrity pet show. Oh? Was that cool? But it's not really what I want to be doing. Course. Well what do you want to be doing? Uh, well... I wanna... - Films? - Be a cinematographer. Yeah. But gotta start somewhere. What're you guys filming? Oh we're just getting him used to the camera a little bit. - Hello Becka! - Hello. Yeah, she's good with... I don't know what to tell. Am I suppose to... Am I suppose to look at or am I suppose to be like... You just gotta talk into the camera, when he's doing the show This is good cause then you're gonna be more used to it as we're going through the hospital. Yeah absolutely - So I just told him tha- - Isn't this gorgeous? Look at like, the sun coming up through the clouds. Oh my gosh, how pretty. Can you see that in the camera? Yeah, we're picking it up! Oh that's awesome. Think this will be a really great experience, so... I think so too. I think like, if it gets picked up, you know like... ...we can go have a bunch of these seasons and... I know! Go to different, like, really... yeah. Check that place out. I hate being that guy who has like... a line of cars behind him, trying to get around. Okay, so I kind of want you guys to talk about... What you know. I mean, you know about Ettersberg Hospital, right? You've done a lot of research on it, you're really into it. So I kind of want you guys just to talk about what you know. The back story of it. If you know any... Just kind of what you're going into this with. Of course, yeah. So um, it was originally used to house railroad workers in 1921 when it was built. In 1924 it was converted to a hospital. Um, it was used to house tuberculosis patients on the upper floors, and the bottom floors are where they kept the children of the tuberculosis patients. Sort of, so they were quarantined... ...from um, the infected patients. It was there that the boiler room caught fire in 1924. And um, ended up burning three girls alive. Uh, in the, in the basement, and that's one of the rooms that we definitely have access to during, the, um, the tour that Jim Bindle will be taking us on. And, uh, no investigative team has ever been there before. So it's really f- - And now actually, it's known to be one of the most haunted places to ever... like.... Like on record. I don't know. I'm a bit more of a skeptic of the group here. You know, I've seen the photos and I mean, yeah, it looks kind of creepy and spooky but I just, I don't, I don't agree that it's haunted. I want you guys to talk about whether you think, um... Whether you think that they could actually cause physical harm to people. I believe that, yes, ghosts are capable of causing harm. They bridge a plane where they're able to actually touch physical objects. Poltergeist being a perfect example of that. They can-people report cupboards closing, doors opening up and shutting in haunted houses, um... but not all ghosts necessarily are something to be feared. The guardian... ...is a very common archetype for ghosts. And it actually helps people out in a lot of cases. People report Um... That they've seen a loved one. Um, that, that, th- They've been pushed out of the way just at the last second before falling down a flight of stairs in their own home. Or um, that they've been pushed out of the way of a car, oncoming. It's... - Not just... - See I like that. I would be open to um, experiencing, experiencing that versus... being afraid of all of it, you know? Like anything, there's good and bad you know. Awesome, ok. - We'll take that. - Was that good? That was good! That was really good, guys. ...It gets them used to talking to the cameras, you know what I mean? Hey! Yeah, get this, get this on record. This is a flaming piece of shit. Jeff! Stop. No, no, no, no, no! Okay listen, we're shooting this because it gets them used to the cameras. It gets them used to talking, it gets them comfortable with the ide- They're insane people! I know! But that's what they do. This is what they're in to, Jeff. This, this is them. We don't know about it because we're not into the paranormal. But they do. Is that tri-rasp-Oh yes! Yes, I'm totally getting these. I like these. I don't like the.. there's just something about the color that looks like it's kind of how I- - Oh what's that for? - Got a little play toy for you? - It's for my little daughter. - Really? - Yeah she likes these. - You have a daughter? - Yeah. Yeah, I have a two year old. I didn't know that! That's awesome! Hey Jeff! If you see... they're supposed to have a really good plum stand up here. If you have like... If you see it, can you stop? - Plum stand? - Yeah. How do you know that there's even a plum stand up here? - Research man. - Research? - Yeah. - You're researching plum stands. Well, I wasn't for specifically plum stands but it was in my research. It was in your research. Yeah, it's like, really well known. You're a fuckin' scientist aren't ya? You're not comin' Callie? Where? I can see the lake from here. It's beautiful. Ettersberg is a very small town and now it's kinda dead. I mean, there's a lot of just local people, that live there, that's been there for-like forever. Um... Um, it was a... mining town? It was used for logging, and then there was a - railroad town before hand. - Yeah. Yeah, and essentially the hospital is kind of a metaphor for it because... This town had a booming economy, and then the corporations came in, exploited them of their resources, and then moved on. The people that remain, are... essentially the people that didn't move on with the corporations. What are you guys doing? I'm just meeting my new husband. Wow, he's cute. - Hey Becka... um... - Huh? Callie's not feeling great so she's just... ...being Callie. Alright! Hopefully she feels better when we get to the hospital. Yeah, she's in the back of the R.V. so... Okay, we're here! Finally. Let's get this tour done. - Oh cool! Andrew! - Do you guys hear that? - Let's do an intro. - Sounds like something dying. Shhh! Come on, it's okay. Calm down, calm down. Listen, we're fine. It's okay! We're supposed to get through this, I realize that now. Everyone's gonna belie- Alright, that's enough. - Andrew! - I'm out of here! - We're gonna be fi- - I'm out of here! This is Chris Mitchel. I'm here with my investigative team and we've just arrived at the Ettersberg Hospital in the remote region of the Northern California wilderness. This hospital, though it has quite a historic lore in many paranormal circles, has never been fully explored. Until now. We're waiting for caretaker Jim Bindle to arrive and give us a tour of thi-the historic property. - Hi Mr. Bindle! - There you are. - Hi. - I was waiting on the other side. I didn't know... - Oh yeah, we didn't... - Chris Mitchel. Nice to meet you. We didn't know which door. Hi, I'm Becka Lassiter. We just wanted to say thank you so much for letting us t- You don't have to thank me. People have been trying to get in here for years and years. I guess cause the owner just died, they probably decided to let you in. - Yeah. Yeah. Well we re- - We do appreciate it. They're gonna demolish this building in a month anyway. - You know? - Yeah. It's a shame. Well we do appreciate it. If you could just... Well let's go on in. You wanna? A quick tour, yeah. That'd be awesome. When was the last time that you noticed someone was here. That you saw lights, or... or... uh, someone that had possibly broken in. Well since you asked me that it's probably been last spring. When I was driving by, and I saw a light. I stopped and took a look, and came back. I don't come in here at night. I just don't do it anymore. Hey, Jim, can you tell us a little bit about that, um, the three little girls story? ... With the fire? Well... I'd say that's when everything started happening. That's when all the st-stories started, I suppose. Yeah. It's a really colorful story. During the WWII they turned this place into a VA hospital. And that's when all the... experimental stuff was happening? The- This is really important for our viewers. Jim! Rumor has it, that in the 40's and 50's this hospital, when it was a VA hospital, was used for experimental testing. - Uh, for a polio vaccine. - Is that true? Well I don't know anything about the experimental stuff. But I think the vaccine part is true. I was just a young boy then, of course, but uh... The word is they were doing the vaccines and the vaccines didn't work out too well. A lot of people got depressed, and... There was one really sad case though. A young, young boy, 19 or 20 years old. He kind of uh, he kind of cut up this nurse that was working here. Then he slit his wrists. Oh wow. It happened in these very rooms. A lot of tortured souls still remain here. Uh, well, I don't know about that either. But it's certainly a lot of history in this building. You guys seem to know an awful lot about this. You did research on this building? We're, yeah, we're really into those things. So um... ...we try to read about it as much as we can and this place is just, it's a huge, huge deal. I mean a lot of people would die to be here. Die! But um... Sorry. I'm not really sure what to believe yet. I'm feeling a little uneasy because I've never... ...this is my first time hearing all of these stories. You know? Chris and Angelina have obviously done research. And this is my first time. So um, I'm feeling uneasy. I'm not really sure... what to believe... I'll have to continue and figure it out. This place is on it's last legs, that's for sure. - Not very structurally sound. - Wow! - Holy crap! - This place is awesome! I heard about this place. Nice room, huh? That's the Chapel. What happened here? After that boy jumped out the window, they stopped using this place as a hospital. Along about that time the logging industry was really big and they started, uh... boarding loggers in here. And uh, they did that for a long time. But there was a really bad winter in '67 I think it was. And the place got all banked in and the loggers were all cut off from the outside world. They all took shelter in here. Eventually all the power went out, and uh, so did they. They froze to death, and that's the story we were talking about the other day. It's where... It's where they resorted to cannibalism. I'm sorry what? - It's true. - No! - Yes! - Come on! Wait, wait, wait, Jeff. Stop. I can't help it. Sorry, sorry. I want you to go ahead and just start fr- This is a fucking real story! I know! Good, just start with the cannibalism thing. Stop. You guys, seriously. Now according to my research, um... I - Fucking... - Um... - One second. Yeah. - Do you need a second? Jim, is it true that the loggers in here had to resort to cannibalism because they were cut off from outside... I don't know about that. I think that's one of them, them old urban legends. What I do know is they were cut off for weeks up here, they didn't have very much food, and when the food ran out so did they. They all died. Makes sense. Okay. Oh, Jim! Would you mind if I... open it up? Go right ahead. What is this place? Shit. Wow. This is sick. Are you sure it's ok that we go in here? Mm-hmm. What is that used for? That's the boiler. Holy crap. I'm here with Mr. Jim Bindle down in the boiler room. Which is one of the lowest levels of the Ettersberg Hospital. This boiler room caught fire, uh, in 1924. And ended up trapping three young girls, who ended up burning to death. We're in here right now, and it's complete darkness. You can't... ...see anything without the aid of a flashlight or an IR... ...tools. Um, Jim, how often would you say you come down here? Since the boiler doesn't work there's no reason to come down here. You can't turn anything on. And it's musty, and there's critters down here. And yeah, it doesn't feel too good. I don't come down here very often. Callie what are you feeling? Um... well now I'm thinking about the critters. Watch your step everybody. Did somebody get cremated back here? Ew. There's hand prints! It's definitely a, it's a boiler, so it's... these are just ashes from the, from the machine. Oh this is incredible guys. Feel this. Look, look, look. This entire room is just freezing cold. Do I want to? Look, don't touch it. Just respect it ok? Don't, just don't... Make sure not to... But can you feel the heat coming off? It's really warm over here. Oh my God, it is! Wow. Jim, can you tell us a little bit about this? What exactly is this? Do you think it might be... Well I don't know much about it. There's a- - Oh my God! - Callie come on! Are you serious? What just happened? Can you get a leash for her or something? What happened? She put some of the ash on me. You kidding me? Uh, Mr. Bindle, can you go take that again? Whatever you were saying? We're sorry. We don't mean to be disrespectful. Nah, I wasn't saying nothin' that I knew. I just heard, that uh... There's no mortuaries in town and this place was a hospital. So when people died... you can draw your own conclusions. I don't know what happened to them. So people were actually cremated on the premises? I didn't say that! I just said they died, and there's no place else to take 'em. Alright guys. Um, that was great. Andrew, Jeff, let's go set up the cameras. Um, for tonight. Do not do that again! What's that? Oh, I'm just gonna have Jeff and Andrew go set up some cameras. Out here, for our investigation tonight. Tonight? How long do you intend to stay here? Oh! We're staying... overnight. No... No, nobody ever told me you were staying overnight. I can't let you in here overnight. - What do you... - That's what we're supposed to do. It's a paranormal investigation. It's okay guys! I'll work it out. Nobody told me nothin' so... We shouldn't have this conversation with the cast... Yeah. Go um... Go scope the area out there... - We have to talk to him about this. - I will. We'll get it worked out. We'll figure it out. We'll make a phone call. Alright guys. Um... No, the original agreement was for us to stay overnight. This is just the tour to see where we're gonna set up. My executive set it all up. Well they can't do it by themselves. They got to get permission from somebody. And nobody told me. Everything is all set up. We were planning on staying here the night. Well little lady, don't tell me everything's all set up if nobody talked to me. Nobody said nothin' about anybody stayin' overnight. Are they still in the office right now? Uh, I... um... Yeah, I guess I'll make... What if we just stay here and you stay with us? No I'm not staying here at night. I got animals to feed and things to do at my place. I can't be staying here at night. Okay... well, um... They just wanted me to come over here and open the place up so you could have a look at it, then you were gonna leave. That's what I was told. We can't get... I mean... You guys promised us, like some good shit. This is not, like... really? A fuckin' tour? Hey Brian, it's Becka. I really need you to call me back. Cause the caretaker's not letting us in the hospital. So... I was told everything was set up. So we need to figure this out ASAP. Call me back. So what's...? - We just wait? - Yeah! I mean, I called him. I just left him a message. - We just wait? - Yeah, I- What else do we do? - What happened? - We don't have any other choices. If we wait until morning, then it's not gonna - fucking matter! - We're not gonna wait until morning, Chris. Ok? We'll figure it out. We have to be there at night! We just can't do it during the day time, ok? Why are you telling me this? I'm the producer! Okay, okay... Then produce, and do something! - Produce something! - Chris! Dude. Enough, enough. Just chill out. - I know, I know. - Okay? Fuck. I love this camera. What are you doing with my camera? That shit's expensive! I know, I'm... This is just so cool. That's your card, don't look at it yet. - Okay. - Yours, mine. Okay, you have to bet. If you think you've got the higher card than your opponent. - What? - Ah! Cheater! Did you lick the same freaking card? - Callie! - Not the same card every time. - You gotta change the card. - What is she doing? I haven't seen her for a while. Alright. Um... So I just got off the phone with my boss back in L.A. And we either... ...shoot tomorrow morning. And shoot all day. Or... ...we... ...turn around and go back to L.A. tonight. So we can't go in tonight? - We can't go in tonight? - No. That's not gonna be a good show. You're not gonna get picked up. Ok. Um... You're saying that we go home? So either way you don- - Okay, well... You're not really giving me any options. Those are our options. - Those are the only... - No! There's other options. - What do you mean? - That we go in tonight. - Chris, we can- - We're not going in tonight. - Why not?! - We can't break in to th- Cause we're not going in tonight! Why can't we? Half those windows are broken already. Yeah, but like, that doesn't mean we can just break into a building! That's illegal, Chris. No, look, come on! There's homeless people, there's no security, there's no freaking alarm. There's nothing! We absolutely can. The place is abandoned, so... They're leveling this thing in a month, anyway! No one's gonna care. And we drove like nine freaking hours. - You guys, we can- - We can't just turn around! Stop. We can't do it. We have insurance to worry about. Insurance! If that's what you're worried about, well if you're worried about insurance, I'll sign a waiver. I'll sign one too. Yeah. Let's, I mean, we can't we can't do a show... I want to actually see stuff and we're... ...talking about the go- - Okay, um... You want a show, this is how it has to be done. Jeff? What do you... we can't break in to a hospital. I mean, if they'll sign a waiver. No! I don't care, waiver or no waiver, do you know how much can go wrong? Yeah, but what's the other option. We go home? Gotta shoot something. Well I don't know about you guys, but I'm in. So, if you're gonna come with me. Jeff, you down - to shoot with me? Andy? - What's going on man? - Oh, God... Andy. - Wanna make a show? - We're going! - Just go get Callie and come on. - Let's go. - Where is Callie? We have to see stuff! That's what you want. I know that! I don't know what I want. I don't know what I'm doing. - Oh my God. - You know you want to. - Uh... - You want to waste nine hours in th- Yeah? Callie said she'd sign the waiver. I guess we're going. Yes! Okay! Go get shit, I'll go get my shoes, and here's your big boy's camera. We're gonna need you guys to carry some of this stuff in for us. We're now on the bottom floor of the Ettersberg Hospital. We've just broken in. Our cameraman Jeff was kind enough to break one of the - locks down for us. - No, Chris... We can't say that we've broken in. Uh... We're now in the basement of the Ettersberg Hospital, we found an open door in the back of the building. We're gonna explore, and look for a base camp. Jeff, slow down. Shhh... - Shit! - Watch it. - There's glass here. - Glass on the floor. - Hey Andrew! - Yeah? We've just got to get a room that we can use for some of the... for some of the gear. Alright, I'll follow you. Oh, this is so cool. It's a lot different at night, isn't it? Won't we get in trouble in here... - It's fine. - How you guys doing? Where are we gonna set up? Yeah, this one will work here. If one of us has to go back out, we can run one of these wires back to the R.V. so we can get some power up in here. Alright. - We need batteries for the flashlights. - We'll set up. We need lights in here, we'll get the camera stuff out... Oh! Goody, goody. Got it. Should I just keep it rolling? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wow, this looks good. We've just snuck in to the Ettersberg Hospital. Against the owner's wishes. I'm leading my investigative team now down to the basement where we're gonna use infrared sensors and night vision in order to continue our investigation. That's such an odd thing to be excited about. What? Ghost stuff? Yeah, ghosts. I mean, I can't imagine it's like fun to... ...think about. Is everything set up? Fun to think about? I don't know if Chris is ever really thinking. Not a sign of light, or life. It looks like this room has been flooded somehow. A pipe burst, perhaps. There's... aw that's cool. And old, old desk. Rooted down to the ground. That Callie girl is so fucking loud. Just let him do what he does. They wanna believe him, and Angelina wants to believe so bad, so... they'll believe. And all we gotta do is ju- Was it really hard to keep a straight face? Just.... It was so hard not to laugh. - He was so serious, bu- - Yeah, dude. He is serious. He is serious. Seriously douchey. Alright, so I've got a couple... - What is that? - It's an incubator. - It looks like it's like a... - For babies when they're born. ...something for rats. Rats don't go in there. Chickens is what you're thinking of. - Baby chickens. - Oh. It's just crazy to think that this at one time.. Wait, I want to take this chair to the other room so I can sit while they set up. We're in one of the hospital rooms right now. Well there's nowhere to sit. Oh shit! Oh shit! Jesus Christ! Why'd you touch that? Oh holy shit! Oh my God! Oh my God. Callie! Jesus Christ! Oh my God, I hit myself in the mouth with my freaking flashlight. Let me see. Holy hell. Ow. - Let me see. Look. - It's probably not serious. You okay? If our R.V. battery goes out, we have... ...no light. Except for our flashlights. Then we use our flashlights. Come on, let's get this stuff. Alright. Come on Andrew! No, like even lower. You want them to be kind of uniform though. - Like, to give the sam- - Hey, this isn't cameraman by committee here, guys. This is fine. Thank you for your help, though, Chris. Do you want me to stand...? There's some serious readings going on right now. Maybe it is too high. Like, what if it was shooting, like angled up a little bit? - No, this is fine. - Would it be creepy? Would it be creepy? Would it be creepy? Creepy? My team and I are now in the process of setting up different IR lights and cameras in order to record nonstop for the rest of the night. How's it look? God, this room is great. Alright, we're good! I know that Chris is pretty much running this, but I need you to do... more. Like I know you're the skeptic of the group here and you don't believe in all this stuff, but... - Okay. - I kind of need more from you. Yeah. Okay, yes, I want you to, yes, exactly. I want you to kind of look like you're... ...investigating a little. Like, oh, this is kind of creepy... I don't know what to think and... ...there's all these hospital beds everywhere. These like incubators for babies, and then like random blood that looks like it was just like... ...slaughtered something right on there. I don't like it in here at all. Alright. You know what, let's just go find Chris. We're now investigating in the morgue. In an area like this, where so many people have... ...seen their end, it's definitely a hot bed for paranormal activity. I have here one of the many tools we use here on this show called a laser grid. And what it does is... ...Jeff you get this? - Perfect. - Ooh! It omits different light sources so that if there's anything passing in front of it, it will leave a shadow. i.e. a spectre, or some type of phantom. It would give off a shape. Now often times that shape could be an orb, it could be humanoid, or otherwise. But, i.e. it develops a shadow in front of it. Sort of like a fisherman's net. Now, you won't see this most of the time because It's not reservable to an, to an infrared - What was that? It's not reservable to inf- - What was that? Look, I'm seriously worried about this show! - Like, this is on my shoulders, Jeff. - I understand. - Oh boy. - What? Talk about production value. There we go. Boy, Chris is gonna go off on that! Like, what about, what about Callie? - What about Callie? - Well... You hear her, it ju- - Honestly, I don't think it matters. I mean... Chris is gonna do his thing, and... If she wants to... Audition for Baywatch or whatever, it doesn't make any difference as long a- - Yeah, but like we need this too look real though. We can't just have her... ...like "Oh my God, my camera time!" We're gonna have to cut out half of everything she says. That's what post-production is for! Hey Jeff, let me ask you, Why are some of them purple and some of them green? Purple and green? Yeah. The.. the, uh, [stammers The color of the... cams. Cause they were all out of pink and rainbow. Asshole. This is Chris Mitchel, I've broken apart from the group to... ...investigate on my own. Oh, this is cool. This is awesome. What is that? Wow. It's all wet in here. It seems maybe like a pipe burst or something. Now the entire floor is wet. Look, I don't know what's gonna happen okay, but we're already in here, let-let's just roll these fucking cameras, get this thing done. Who knows? My God, it might work out! What do you mean it might? It better! What do we got here? Huh. Wow, there's something in this room. This room is good. No, it's too big. We need a good room. We need this to work, Jeff. What? The show or the room? The... both. Cause if we have a good room, we can just set up some good gags, and we'll... make it good. What about this room? We're gonna do the flashlight here, ok? We're gonna start with it off... Don't... ok. Yeah, um... Do we have to do this? - I mean... - Yes. - Alright. - We need... okay. So you're gonna start that off, you're gonna say, you know "If you're here, go ahead and turn it on." Or whatever it is, ok? Turn it on... We'll get our gag. Make it real. It is... what do you mean - make it real? - Oh, ok. Go ahead. We're down here in the basement of the hospital, and this room in particular has an incredibly cold feeling to it, so we decided to step in. And what appears to be a very old dentist's chair... Uh, we're now gonna ask the spirits, if they can hear us, if they'll show us a sign of their existence. Okay. We feel you in here. We acknowledge your presence. And we respect it. If you're in here... Please give us a sign, by turning off this flashlight. Just wait, wait, wa- Just wait a second. Alright. Turn it off. Wow. My team and I are making our way deeper in to the hospital. There's a... strange feeling to this room, almost like a dizziness. Uh, a very uncomfortable feeling in our stomach. A moment ago we heard a sound... ...and we're now finding our way in here to ask the spirits... If they acknowledge our presence. If they welcome us. Then can they show us a sign, by moving something in this room... Woah, woah, look at that! What was that? Do people actually buy this shit? I know. Like obviously yes, we can see the string. Ha, ha, th-but... We'll remove that in post. Okay, for this one, I want to see a shadow of some sort. Okay, just... - Just.. just walk through. - Like really fast. He's scared. Chris, you're in the shot. Well we're supposed to be investigating, what... Chris, I have to see the gag. Okay, do it again. - Go ahead Andrew! - Are we scared? - No... - He looks like a killer! What was that? - What was that? - Did you hear that? We're now in complete darkness as we move deeper and deeper into the basement of the Ettersberg Hospital. Where are we? Can we walk through this? Is this water, or is it like dirt, or... - It's water. - Oh shit. You guys! This place is not supposed to have any power. - The light is flickering. - Oh my God... Where? Right here, there's a light flickering. Did you see this light? Yo guys, you gotta check this out. There's three desks down here. Wow. There are three desks. I'm not even kidding. You guys, oh my God. - Oh shit. Alright. - Sorry. No! Turn off the light. Hey, turn off the flashlight. We don't use flashlights unless it's an emergency. This is insane. Look on the floor. There are prints. Tiny little handprints. This is crazy. There's the stairs. Did you hear that? Oh, it's incredible. Look! Guys, one of the signs of paranormal activity is disrupting electrical items. This thing is actually freaking out right now and it's a fully charged battery. We just charged this. What the hell was that? There's a crib. On you-on your left. Shit, that is- You alright? Yes! Sorry... shit. There's an incredible amount of heat over there, and this entire room is freezing. It's... ...still hot. I don't... Really unusual. Seriously. Be careful. There's definitely like... there's different feeling here. You guys can all agree to that. There's just... It really feels like you're in a vice. And it's like... been pressured. I don't know. The air is like, thicker. It's really hard to breathe down here. And the smell is definitely, definitely getting stronger. The feeling is... yeah. There's like a chill. Like a certain chill. You're really cognizant of what you're hearing. Because a lot of times it's not just smells, there's also phantom sounds. So you could hear something like music, or you'd hear laughing or crying or something like that. We're looking for some... ...sign. Some ack- acknowledgement of the existence of spirits down here, okay? Chris we need more gags. I know. What are we doing now? Okay, so for this to work we have to do another gag, um... Let's do something about the girls disappearing. I got it. Okay. Uh, Becka, um... Yes? Can you... can you um... Can you scream? Can you like-have like a muffled scream? Right, scream for me. - Are you being serious? - Yes I'm being serious. Scream. Hey Angelina, can you just take your camera... Sorry, I know. So I can hear what it... That's fine. Okay fine, um... Hide, we're gonna be investigating this room, and... Um, I want you to go around. I want you to count to 15... Wait, hold on, hold on, So now he's directing the gags? - Yeah... I don't... - Wait, no, no, listen, listen. This is gonna work. If you guys wanna do this, you said you would do it my way. - Okay, we'll get it done - Stop yelling. - Fine - Relax, okay, okay, okay. Okay, listen. We need more gags for the show. So I told Chris, since he does this kind of thing, he could think of something. This is a good one, if it doesn't work then... then it doesn't work. If it doesn't work then we don't use it. ...going downhill quickly. If this doesn't work then we don't use it, okay. That's fine, alright. Hey, look. ...whatever works. Okay, will you... will you do that? Yeah. Can we do it today, because like, really guys. Count to 20, and then scream, okay? And we're gonna pretend like we're investigating this room. And then we're gonna hear it, okay? We'll react to it. Jeff make sure you have my reaction on it, okay? Yeah. - Okay? - I'm just... - Alright. - Okay, 20. Oh my God. Let's find some ghosts. Come play with us. There's certain telltale signs and indications that there's paranormal activity in the area. Often times it could be something like a smell. You smell some perfume, or, if the deceased was a cigar smoker, you'll smell something similar to that. A lot of times it's sounds. You'll hear music on loop. Um, screams, crying, especially if children were involved. Uh, a lot of times an area with paranormal activity is cold because the spirits need energy, so they're gonna pull energy from that particular area. They're gonna pull the warmth from that area. This is one of those areas right now, it's incredibly cold in here. What is that? Becka. Becka! - Becka? - Where'd she go? Becka? ...taking forever. - She there? - I don't know, she's gone. What do you mean she's gone? - She's not there. - I don't know, she's not here. - Um... - Seriously? Maybe she went to the bathroom or something? I don't know. She's hiding out. Becka! Maybe she went back to the R.V or something? Maybe. Yeah. I don't know. Well I'll just call her. I have my cell phone. Jeff, come here. Did she say anything to you? Like.. What like she was gonna...? Well shit, I don't have service down here, so... We talked about doing gags for you guys for the show, to get you all, you know, fired up and... get you all in a panic, so, yeah, it's possible. I don't wanna be left out of the loop, man. Oh, she's good. She's really good. Why don't we just split up and uh... look around. Meet back here, and if we see her, holler. Okay, um. Jeff and Angelina, you guys go this way, Um, Callie, Andy, let's go. Let's meet up here I n a couple of minutes, okay? If you guys hear anything... Yeah, we'll shout. Yell. Don't go too far. You guys, she's probably over there. Becka? Where did she go? Becka! I swear she's gonna like, jump out and... and scare us or something. I'm like scared to go by all these doors. - Uh, Angelina, why don't you... - Which way? Why don't you go down this way, and I'll go down this hallway. This place is like a maze. It'd be easier to... round her up that way. Alright, um, five minutes here. If you hear Becka just scream alright? I'll hear you over there. - Scream, okay. - Scream. Becka! Do you know how to turn it on? Yeah. Alright then. Becka! Good? We'll continue our search for Becka, our producer. So far, no sign. This is so frickin' incredible. People are gonna frickin' die. We're in base camp, now, where we have cameras set up on almost every single corner of this hospital. If anything moves in here, we'll catch it. We're now waiting for our producer, Becka. Who went disappearing about 45 minutes ago. And, a splinter group went searching for her. We couldn't find her. Hopefully our comrades have had better luck. Becka? What do you think of this place? - Creepy. - I don't know, I... I don't know what's going on. Like, I... I don't know where she went. I mean, she's the one producing the show. Like, I'm not sure what to think. Callie I can promise you one thing: Becka is fine, okay? Well this place is dark, and scary, and it's the middle of the night. And we've been here forever, like, I just... Believe me, it's all gonna get resolved. Jeff and Angelina have probably already found her by now. Becka? Becka? Jeff! Boo. Shit. Thanks for that. It's scary down there. Really? Cause we haven't noticed. Yeah. Andy, turn on the camera, man. You guys find her? - Hey, no, did you? - Did you find her? No, we didn't find her. I could have sworn she was here. You gotta be kidding me. Oh shit. Jeff, level with us, man. She's playing a trick on us right now, she's doing a gag? Dude, I... She had to have said something. Not that she told me. What are you looking at me like that for? Because you guys were in on it together. She's obviously not getting what she wants... I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. - I'm not in on anything together. - Fine. I don't know why you think I know what the fuck is going on I'm a fucking cameraman. I'm just hired to shoot you guys and run around. These guys don't believe this to begin with anyway, so- No shit I don't believe in it. Can I talk to you for a second? Okay, I wanna know what's going on with Becka. Put that-put the camera down for a second. Stop recording for a second. Are you fucking kidding me? No, I'm not kidding you. Alright dude, what's up. I wanna know where Becka is, and I wanna know what you're doing with her. I fucking told you, man. What are you talking about? I don't believe you. If you don't stop fucking around this show's gonna fail. Think that's gonna look good for your reel? Alright, dude, you wanna know the truth? Yes! You really wanna know the truth? Yeah. The truth is, is that a unicorn flew in here, and took... - Jesus fucking Christ. - ...Becka away. I saw it dude. It was fucking unbelievable. - You're fucking unbelievable. - I got the footage on- You're fucking unbelievable. Nothing's fucking serious with you. Fucking tell me where she is. Hey! I'm fucking serious! Tell me where she is! You really wanna know? Here's the thing. Dude, relax. We don't wanna tell the other castmates. We knew that you have the intensity to do this thing, But, the other two are fuckin' wildcards. Becka's fucking trippin' because she's not sure if she's gonna get a performance out of those two. She's trying to pull some stops out get you guys fuckin' freaked out. But you can fuckin'- You can play it off and, you know, like... You know, you don't know shit. But, let the fuckin' girls think... Now we should just sit and... contemplate something for a little while. Are you gonna go missing, too? Maybe. Possibly. Gather up the equipment, let's go. So, what are we doing? Are we finding Becka? Are we filming the show? We're filming the show, Andrew. Yeah, let's film it. Okay. She'll turn up. No, not this one. It's not this one. It's not this one. Earlier in our tour, today with Caretaker Jim Bindle, he mentioned that vagrants over the past several decades have been coming in and out of the hospital walls. This room, littered with graffiti, is obvious evidence of these squatters. Callie. As the skeptic of the group, what does it feel like to be in the rooms with such obvious negative energy? I don't know, Chris. I mean, just... because there's some writing on the wall, doesn't mean it's possessed. I mean... Obviously whoever wrote this was... deeply disturbed or insanely bored, but... Wow. Even in the presence of such obvious negative energy, Some skeptics still refuse to acknowledge the supernatural. Let's move on. Angelina, seriously? Are you ever gonna stop being a jackass? This room's awesome. This is so intense. I think it's the room Jim was talking about on the tour. The one where the nurse was killed by one of the patients. Oh that's right. It's almost like a maternity ward, it's a... recovery room or something. This is fant-this is amazing. Do you feel that? How like, if you just, close your eyes and take it in for a second, you'll, you'll definitely get what I'm talking about. Okay, I'll try. I don't feel anything. Jeff, um, we're gonna go in here and we're gonna film, um... me explaining some of the equipment and stuff, talk about the IR talk about the laser grid and everything. Uh... Angelina, can you come with us? And Jeff you stay out here, and get us like, coming out, yeah. We'll get like, the laser grid up against the far wall, like give a scope... Angelina come shoot this. This is so cool, you'll love it. Jeez forget ghosthunter, you're a straight producer now. Well, it would be, it-it, someone's gotta do it. I'm, no I'm with ya. I'm with ya, okay, alright. - Will you please stay out here? - Yeah. Thank you. You set? Uh yeah, I'm all good out here. Okay, cool. So... Ooh, there's so many spiderwebs. Hold on, a second. Earlier tonight, we heard a humming. Coming from above us. Very unusual because this building, according to the caretaker Jim Bindle, hasn't had power for the past 15 years. This is one of the many tools that we use in order to to find specters... Alright. Before you go out, do you have a vague light, you know? You're exploring. He's gonna capture you guys coming out. Let's get the grid coming out. Ready? Careful. Watch your... Jeff! This is his camera. Jeff! Jeff. - The heck? - What the fuck? Jeff! Jeff, you totally dropped this camera man! This is super expensive! I knew it. Fuck! Are you kidding me right now? Becka and him are both together. I guarantee it, right now. There just trying to get something for the show. Jeff! They're just trying to scare us. Yes, I am positive. Jeff, it's not funny. How can you get anything for the show if his camera's here. Because there's 15 cameras set up all throughout this place. Can I have my flashlight back please? I only saw him with one. That one, yeah, exactly. - But he's got like... - Jeff! Andrew he's with Becka, come on! No he's not with Becka, I would have known. He would have told me something about that. Twenty bucks he goes mixing next. They're both in on it. Are you in on this, Andrew? Why would you say that, dude? No I'm not in on this, I'm not... enjoying this at all. They're just trying to get good television. That's all they're doing, they're trying to sell the pilot. Well this sucks. And I'm over it. Yeah, okay. Jeff! Come on! Not funny! Guys, look, look, look, look. I don't wanna play this game anymore, Jesus Christ. Calm down. Hey, calm down. Calm down. This isn't funny. I'm not doing the show until we find them, okay? We're gonna keep looking for them, okay? But I'm telling you right now I know exactly what they're doing. I don't know exactly what they're doing. I should know exactly what they're doing. That's the problem, man. They're leaving you in the dark just like us so you look just as scared as us, okay? Are you fucking with us or not? - No! - Please tell us the truth now. It doesn't serve anybody if we just run around here not filming and not getting what we came here to do. We need to just keep investigating... Why are you so concerned with filming? Let's just get the fuck out of here. Because that's what we're here for, Callie, okay? You wanna be an actress? I thought you didn't believe in this anyways. I fucking hate you. Flashlight. Alright, so what's the plan now. You seem to know everything. We keep exploring. Jeff! They're gonna come out, don't worry, when we least expect it. And we'll get a scare and we'll be laughing about it later. Don't worry about it. Come on. Wait guys. Here, guys. What, where are we going? Down here? Have you been here? I don't know. You guys, I just heard something. I didn't hear anything, let's go. I swear I just- Callie! Callie! Oh my God! Callie! Grab her!

We're gonna be fine. She just got ripped into nothing. Nothing! Come on. Come on. Come on. Where the fuck are we going? Do you remember anything? As soon as they open the door we're gonna break for it. Yes. We're gonna go straight for the window. - Ok. Please be careful. - Just stay close. Go, go, go. Shit! Go! Oh, shit! Is that a good thing or a bad thing? There's no lights. What is that? What? What's what? That's not good. Don't move. - Oh my God! - Oh shit! Shit! Shit! Okay, go!! Don't run away from me, bitches!

Breath. Look at me. Look at me. Breath. - This isn't helping. - Shh! I know it's not helping. It doesn't matter, okay? We can't do anything. Alright? There's nothing we can do right now. We just have to stay calm. Okay? We're out of power, we're at their mercy right now. Okay? Just... don't give in, but don't fucking, just don't panic. Alright? If we're meant to get out, we'll get out. I have an idea. What are you doing? We have to get to the first floor, so we can get out. - Are you crazy? - Come on, come on. - Are you sure? - Yes.
