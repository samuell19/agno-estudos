Trees Grow on the Stones Too (Dragens Fange) It's been a long time. A long time ago. More than a thousand years ago, when there still was no Russia and no Norway but there were lands on which people lived and died, whose descendants will call themselves Russians and Norwegians. "Times change, customs and traditions change, also faith and way of thinking, but the hearts of men at all times remain the same ... " Norwegian writer Sigrid Undset Kuksha! Kuksha! Kuksha! Kuksha, throw a piece! A bear sacked the board. No bees, no honey. Go home. I'm with you. You're no helper to me. Tell mother that I won't return without an elk. Go on. Poor seed. Grandfather, give me. Kuksha! He's gone on the hunt. On the hunt. Why did he take the girl with him? She went by herself. Have you seen it? That's no mischief, he is the sole man we have he carries all our hope. Much strength is needed to kill an elk. And how to get strong from these roots? You can not. There will be nothing to sow. We'll die. Dont worry, dear, don't worry. We survived through the winter, and now maybe Kuksha ... ... will find something. Quick, here it is. Here! This way. How did you beat it? You are not wounded? Let me through. Oh, you look at that, look how he beat him. He skillfully coped with a noose, eh? - Do not cry, you have to rejoice. - I rejoice You are our benefactor. He inherited his father's knack. Well done. Well, now we won't hunger. Normans! Normans! Normans! Mom, Normans! I found her under the bench. She bites like a wolverine. Eynar, ask her where her relatives are. Tell me where are all the people? She won't say, Sigurd had frightened her. I'll force her. Wait, Sigurd! In the hearth is fire, they are somewhere close. Do not cry, no one will hurt you. Where is your father? I asked about her father. - Is she mocking us? - No, that's a grave. Your father was killed? Normans! Run, Normans! Normans! Get away all! I can handle him myself. Kuksha! I will slowly kill you. I will slaughter you with your knife. Wait, Sigurd. He doesn't understand. He'll die. He raised a hand at a Viking. Drop it! He will be useful to us. Get him up. Here were Danes. They killed all the men. I thought so. We have nothing to do here. Thorir! We found some corn. Leave it to them. Otherwise, they will die. Let go of them! Hold him! You lost a good slave. He could be a good warrior but a slave - is unlikely. Have you lost something there? Well, come here. Well, come on. Now you won't die from hunger. I will help you drown. I'm in no hurry. Don't get a rupture. Do not interfere. Sigurd will kill him. No, it won't be easy to take off his skin. Fish will be fed. He drowned? What happened? Look, there he is. Take him alive. Catch up to us when you get some rest. Bring him to the boat. Kuksha! Kuksha! Kuksha! Where did he come from? I'll throw that shit overboard. Do not argue with the gods, Sigurd. Odin sent us this young man alive. The Sea God did not want him to drown. Nor thy sword, nor the sea mouth could bite him. He will bring us luck. Look. 8 days we were at the oars, but now the gods sent us a breeze. This is a sign. Sigurd will not touch him. No one will touch him. He is a free man. Get ready to sail. Great is the warrior, who fell down but is on his feet again. Kuksha! Kuksha! Good thing you did not stop him. Do you see him? Land. Land! These are probably the snake islands. Without him we would have passed by. It would be hard on us without trink water. My father used to tell about these islands. No one had luck anchoring here. Our luck is before us. Gods are guarding him. Not for nothing we survived the storm. Take it. Eat. Get dressed. Do not grieve, you still would have died in these desert areas. Or you would get captured by the Danes who killed your father. Stay away from the coast, Sigurd! Thorir says that you will bring us luck. What is it? This is resin. We will repair the ship ashore. Ship on the starboard side! Hold the oars! Dressed in black. These are Danes, I guess. Kar, replace me. These are Danes! Row back! No, wait, no one will say that we ran away. If they attack, they'll get to know the bites of our swords. Give back my knife. He asks for his knife to fight those who killed his father. Well, now we will certainly win. Another ship. We fell into a trap. Let them try to attack us. Today will be a lot of work. Who is your leader? I am, Thorir. With me is Eynar, the son of my dead brother Ring. And who are you? I'm Utley. With me is my brother Atsur. You can choose: either to go to the shore and give us all the goods or we'll cut down all of you. Only the Danes are in such hurry over other man's prey. You do not like to fight, Utley? Odin will decide who wins. Go! Go! Get ready for battle. Take the weapons. Remove the oars. You will pay dearly for that. Remove the oars. Cut the ropes. Cut it! Protect the foreigner. Sigurd! Thorir! The pig got caught in a net. Surrender! Board the ship! What are you doing? You'll burn the ship. Look what he thought out. He must die. Kill him! Help them! Go! He's mine. Should have left at least gold. Stop it! Atsur! You wanted to kill me basely, but killed Eynar instread, try to kill me in a fair fight. I feel sorry for you, you will not be able to make a song about this battle. I will help you meet your brother by Odin. Give me a shield. Now we are on equal footing. Watch out! You were and remained a bastard. - Take the knife, Thorir! - Don't interfere! No one should say that I killed you unarmed, take the sword. Thorir! I present to you this ship! Now you'll be a rider on the death's horse. Hi Utley. Thanks, Sigurd. He saved your life. You don't understand me. And you helped us. I did what you asked Thorir. I lit the sacred fire. Sigurd his bravery earned the right to send on their final journey our fallen warriors. They go into another world. With rich gifts. To continue to live in the country of Odin. I will let you go. You will tell everyone about the death of Eynar the wise and the Danish konungs Utley and Atsur. We heard about your dignity, and now we have seen it. I'll return your ship. Once we shorten it by a head. Thorir let us go and gives us a ship. Go to the ship. We are sailing for two years. This young warrior accompanied us against his will. But in the battle he earned the right to be among us. He will replace Eynar. I will make him a Viking. From now on you are Eynar. Eynar the lucky. Thorir's son. I'm giving you Eynar's sword. At dawn we'll go further to the north. There, where trees grow on the stones. The Vikings are coming! The ship is on a fjord! Run to the coast! It's Thorir with his retinue. They were long absent. One winter and two summers. They probably want to winter here again. It is strange that he recognized her. She was still a child. And now she's ready to become a wife. I was a puppy when I gave it to you. He's probably forgotten me. What a beautiful bracelet you have. This is nothing. The ship is heavily loaded. We can host them all? They did not come empty-handed. We have to prepare the tables if they want to spend the winter here. Let's wait and see. I salute you, Thorir. We are happy to see you. I also salute you, Tyra. It feels good to step on the homeland. Your beard turned gray. And you are as beautiful as before. I don't see Olaf, your husband. His was wounded by a bear during the hunt. He will be glad if you visit him. We would like to spend the winter here, but if ... You know Olaf, we are always happy to receive you. And where is your nephew? Eynar died. He is by Odin. But I have avenged him. Erwin asks who that stranger is. We took him in Gаrdаrike. Now he is my stepson. Come on, he's calling you. Why does Olaf not meet us? Maybe he wanted us to have passed by? I named him Eynar in honor of my nephew. He helped us in the last battle. I gave him the nickname the Lucky one. You must be tired. Be our guests. The campaign is over, we stay here. Madam. Bring on the tables all that we have do no hide anything. Help me. Sigurd comes with a gift for everyone. Leave it here. From where is this wooden noggin? Tell us. It's no short story. Kuksha! Well, listen up. I took this wooden head off the Utley's boat. I won't be sipping sea water anymore. But Utley will sip plenty. I sent him to the seabed. From now on his sword is mine. Sigurd likes to boast. Bath is ready, Thorir. Thank you, Tyra, you always know what we need most. Olaf is calling you, Thorir. It will get up to meet you at the banquet. He also wants to see Eynar the lucky. See you at the feast, Thorir. The musicians there. All set? You have always been hospitable, Olaf. Here you have our gifts. Kwan. He gave her a kwan. Thank you, Thorir. Thank you. Come on, come on. It's time to sleep. Here, give it to Harald. Take it, it's yours. I know Slavic. Here are all our gifts, you will distribute them, Olaf. Guttorm will give you our gifts in return. But first Olaf wants to meet the foreigner. Everyone has heard about him, because glory is always with those who have luck in battle. This is Eynar the happy from Gardarike. He is the adopted son of Thorir. Olaf thinks that he will bring us luck as well. And we will peacefully spend the winter together. Give the horn to our guest. Your mind is far away, stranger. Get back. Be happy with us. Now, I want to drink for Thorir and his valiant warriors. Let them always spend the winter with us. And let them have as much catch as much can be loaded on the boat, but only so that it wouldn't sink. What do you think? Remember, there was a sign, and the witch said: "With the rising luck will come". She was not mistaken. She also said, that this would be the last good luck in my life. You will pass on the luck to your son when you die Harald will get your power and he will need warriors. His friends, not his slaves. An alien bird may be more loyal than others. Have you noticed how he looked at Signy? Yes, but this is not news. He also looked at her like that before. Who? Sigurd. I'm talking about Eynar. I never liked Sigurd. I promised Sigurd that Signy will become his wife. You don't understand. Harald and Eynar should get to know each other. Think about it. And remember, I'm talking about Eynar, no wonder he was nicknamed the lucky one. Gods have sent him to us. He should stay here. Nothing left. They didn't leave anything even for the dog. Thorir, Tyra is calling you. Guttorm is now the main man here. Yes, so it seems. The cold came. We went ashore in time. Welcome! You're still alive, bald man? I wonder when you'll take me to Rome. I don't mind. Where is your youngster? He stayed there. He's not feeling well. Was the horn too large for him? It will be better, Thorir, if Guttorm will teach Eynar. He will help him learn the language. Together with Harald they will be teached the use of arms. Olaf wants them to friends. He can already speak a little bit. But Olaf's will is law to me. I recognize you, Thorir. You have always been faithful to friendship. As the older brother I forbid you to touch him. Go to your Sigurd. Here, take your knife. And now we'll tie you up. Fighting with girls, Harald? Here, I have prepared the swords. That's right. Come on, let's try it. Take the shield. Take it. Begin. That's enough. I've already killed him. Help him. You're in a hurry, Harald, We won't understand what he is good at. Calmly. Well, Eynar. Give it to him, Harald! Do not forget that you are a Viking, Eynar! He fights not by the rules. Courage is not enough to become a true warrior. You need skill. Sigurd, come here. Give me a stick. Show him the art of defense, Sigurd. Attack. Surrender, Sigurd. Cowards! Let's go. What is kwan? Kwan? Kwan is very rare root. It smells good and protects from illnesses. The most precious gift for women. More precious than gold. What did he say? He said Sigurd wants to take Signy as his wife. Only power can give a man gold, women and fame. That's my sword. Eynar's sword - my sword. Why is it here? You came to us with peace. Therefore, your weapons are here. Just in case. Sigurd's chain-mail. Sigurd is a berserk. And what is a "bersek"? "Bersek" ia a warrior, who is protected by the Gods. - So, why does he need a mail? - Just in case. My father was a blacksmith. Can you forge armor? No chain-mail. A sword? I can try it. Trees Grow on the Stones Too (Dragens Fange) Episode two Go to the boat, watch the fire. Want to run away. And where to? There's nowhere to run. I also ran away when I was young. I've seen a lot of countries. I'm a slave from childhood. And let me tell you, slavery is the same everywhere. It's not bad here. How do you know my language? Me? I know about seven languages. And seven dialects. Only they do not care. For them I'm just a baldy. But I had a name. How were you called? Levius. And I was called me Kuksha. Their gods don't need to know this. Otherwise they will turn their backs on you. For them you are Eynar. Eynar the lucky. But you aren't lucky? You're also a slave. I am not a slave. I'm the son of Thorir. I know, I know. But they'll never let you go. They believe that you bring happiness. Still, I will run away. I must return home. This cap was given me in Holmgard, that is in New Town, by a good man. It's always with me now. It keeps my bald head warm. Say Levius, where is my home? In that direction. But you can't go there by foot. Nobody has ever succeeded in that. Still, I will leave this place. Then your mother will never see you again. I'll go away. Where is Eynar? He is up there. Listen to the old Levius, hold on to Thorir. He'll go again to Gardarike and you can go with him. That's great. Show me one more time. Look, like this. She is everywhere. How come Sigurd let you go? He is not my husband yet. Are you afraid of him? Don't be afraid. He is hunting. Give back the knife. He spoke. Give me the knife! Try and take it away! Well, come here. The bear was caught. You like it there? I'll help you. Well, get up. I'll close your grave so that you can celebrate the wedding in another world. Don't joke, Harald. He doesn't understand you either way. Come over here. Go up. What about Signy? Leave her alone. She'll get out. You sit there. Go away. The she-wolf Signy. Let her sit. She keeps interfering in our affairs. Harald, why did you call her a she-wolf? A she-wolf? That year, when Signy disappeared, was very hungry. Girls were carried off into the woods. There was no food. But Signy ran away on her own. The witch Ingrid saved her. The witch said that she was brought by a wolf. Since then people call Signy a she-wolf. I said she will get out by herself. Let him try and harm us. It's true that he brings luck. In these forests weren't that many partridges before. Have you seen the dog? No. Don't worry. Signy won't tell him. One squad isn't enough to go to Rome. Rognar took Paris with one squad. Paris is a village. Rome is Rome. - Do you want to go to Rome? - I want to. But first I want to eat well. You will soon get married, you'll get roped and stay here. The bald man said that Rome is very rich. I won't get roped, I'm not a bull. Thorir won't go to Rome. He wants to go to Gardarike. There he will trade rather than fight. And where is Thorir? He was called by Olaf. - Olaf is very ill. - The witch came, I've seen her. I am, I am asking ... ... I am asking you, Thorir. I thought that I'll get up to collect tribute from my subjects. You'll have to replace me. Take half of ... ... my men. And go. I advise you to take Sigurd with you. Take Sigurd with you. I intended ... Sigurd listens to you. Who knows what he may do in your absence. I intended to take Eynar with me. Eynar will stay here. I heard that Harald befriended Eynar. Is it true, Guttorm? It is true. Give him the sword. If you'll go to Rome, Thorir will go too. Thorir doesn't need me. He has Eynar the lucky. I'll go with you. Your father won't allow it. Then I'll run away. He'll forgive me when I'll be back with booty and glory. He hasn't left yet but has already returned. What if you get lost on the way where we spend the winter? You could borrow a boat from your father and take half of the men with you. I'll get the ship and run away. And you Sigurd, if you won't go with me, I will not give you Signy in marriage. What did he say? Wipe off the snot first. And you, Lucky, If you dare touch Signy, then I'll break your neck. We will soon go collect the tribute. Sigurd will come with me. Choose 20 men. Will Eynar also come? No. He will stay here. It's the will of Olaf. His last will. Had a big catch? Yes, there was a lot of fish today. Yes, I see it. Here, take it. Gather the rest of the fish in the boat. Would Olaf still be alive, he would be pleased, Harald. Yes, my father was a good fisherman and hunter. It is a pity that he didn't take me with him to Odin. But I will faithfully serve you as well. What do you mean "didn't take you with him to Odin"? When they bury a master, his slaves are buried with him. "Fingir" - the finger. Arm. Lips. Signy. I'm very grateful to you that Harald and Eynar became such friends. Did you see the sword which Eynar forged? He is a good swordsmith. He would become a good slave. It would be a pity to sacrifice him If Olaf wanted to take him into his grave. He would never be a slave. Did you notice that Eynar and Signy ... Yes, that's good. Now he is doesn't want to leave with Thorir. Harald should not disturb them. If Sigurd learns of it, he will kill him. Thorir will be able to defend his adoptee. Don't worry about Sigurd. Just as by us. What did you say? At home. What do you think all the time? I know. You do want to return home. How do you know my name? The baldy told you. Don't think badly of him I won't tell anyone. I locked it. Are you satisfied? - Do you have brothers? - Only small ones. It's a pity. If they were adults you would return home, gather a retinue, they would become warriors, and you the konung. You would travel, and I would see you again. Signy. Don't go. I want you to stay here forever. Someone awaits you there? No. No. Yes. They are waiting for me. My mother, my little sisters and brothers. I often dream of them. I wish I could come to you in your dreams. Look! A sign! Sigurd has returned. Signy! Come back! She thought that Sigurd came back. It was me who let the dog out. Take a comb and comb his hair. Come over here. I will gather a squad and go to Rome. My father is by Odin. I'll become a konung, and you'll come with me. No. I'll go with Thorir, my foster father. You're not a slave, you can go with whoever you want. I'll talk to Thorir when he returns. No, do not. You don't want to stay here? I can't. He wants Sigurd to stay here. He is afraid of him. Do you want to go with Thorir but not me? It is you who is afraid of Sigurd. Do not interfere when men are talking! Adult men have nothing to do in girls' room. Come. Give me my clothes. This is a temple. Here we make sacrifices to the gods. Great Odin, look. When men mix their blood, they become brothers. We are now brothers. Brothers. Yes. This is our secret. Yours and mine. Your insult - my insult. Now Sigurd is our common enemy. He wants to marry Signy and become the konung. But he won't get her. Signy will be your wife. When we return from Rome, she will be standing on the shore ... Thorir has returned with tribute. Aren't you afraid, Signy? Not when I'm with you, Sigurd. Thank you and your warriors, Thorir. All ours is also yours. I want to talk about Eynar. He and Harald are friends now. Guttorm taught them swordcraft. Now you can talk with your son. I want Eynar to stay. It seems that he likes forgin more than traveling. People from Gardarike don't like to fight. They are proud and courageous. And patient. But if they get angry, I wouldn't want to have them as enemies. They don't have the main thing, that makes a man a Viking. Desire for power and a sense of revenge. You're right. They are not vindictive. Listen Thorir, would you like intermarry with us? Intermarry? I noticed that Eynar and Signy ... You forget that Signy has to become the wife of Sigurd. Olaf promised that. Now he is with Odin. If Sigurd hears of it, he will kill Eynar. Sigurd will go with you. He is a Viking. His life means traveling, his house is the boat. He will take revenge. I thought you were not afraid of your own warriors. Let this be our secret. Think about it, Thorir. I'll think about it. Show me. How funny. Did you make it for me? Show me what he has done. Yes, your place in the smithy. Here is a real gift. Give me your hand, Signy. Let's go. You have to give gold to women. You're in a hurry to die. We'll get rid of Sigurd, then his gold will be ours. Signy will kiss the marks of your feet. We'll take a potion from the witch Ingrid, to make Sigurd fall asleep and never wake up. No Harald, no potion. We are brothers. Your insult is my insult. This must be resolved in a fair fight. Should Sigurd die with a sword in his hands, he will be feasting by Odin. Sigurd is not worth it. Wait here. I'll call you. Oh, you found what I was looking for. Here you are, Eynar the lucky. I heard about you from Signy. She still comes here? If it is true that you bring people luck, maybe you can help the poor Ingrid. By curing her. I'll give you a potion, Harald. Although you don't want to say what you need it for. You're stepping on a dangerous path. You want to kill a big beast. Look. You see the dragon? He can change his shape. Become light, darkness, water and fire. At night he devours the sun, and in the day he devours the moon and the stars. We all are the captives of the dragon: children and elders, lord and servant. Because of him we crave for power, wealth and glory. Only a few can resist him. I have what you are asking. Take the potion. Be careful. You're young and can become easy prey for the dragon. The potion will come into force by spring during the feast of the Idises. I helped you for Signy's sake. Now go, I'm tired. Eynar brings happiness, hold to him. Go on. Come over here. Thorir wants to test him. This is Thorir's crowning strike. Enough! Enough! Now I don't have to worry about you. You can go. Will you come with me or stay here? No. I don't want to stay here. And if we aren't going to Gardarike? A Viking doesn't have a home. His home is the boat, his life are travels. Guttorm did really make you a Viking. I see that Signy avoids you. She is with Sigurd all the time. I don't care. You should not quarrel with Sigurd. Be careful. You should not blindly trust nice promises. Women are sneaky. They are blinded by the gold and glory. We will soon go on a long jouney. Snowdrop. Snowdrop. We call them "snow bells". What is it? Go to sleep. What's with you? See to the sail. Well, we lived through the winter. A good year. No one died from hunger. Fasten it well! No one was taken to the woods. It would be bad after Olaf's death if you weren't here. After all, you brought Eynar the lucky. He will probably go with you? - Why do you need to know that? - Me? No reason. He is a great master. This is what we needed. Well done, Eynar. Go away. - Take the ax and help. - I will give you the ax. Come with me. Take and carry the nails to them. I knew you would forget about your home. But I know how to keep secrets, I said nothing to Thorir. he doesn't know that you stay here. You will marry Signy. Well, you make a good pair. Look, slave ... And now even you speak to me as a lord. Is that all you wanted to tell me? Signy sent me. She wants to meet you. She said: "If he won't believe you, show him this". I knew you would come. Come on, they could spot us. - I'm not afraid. - But I am. You don't believe me anymore? You're not right for me. You are with him all the time. I'm afraid. I don't want him to kill you. Do not be angry. I beg you, don't go. I will come back, Signy. Don't leave. Don't leave. I'll marry you, and you'll become Harald's real brother. How do you know that we are brothers? I know that you were by Ingrid and that everything will be decided tomorrow. Then nobody will be able to separate us. You want it too, do you? Yes, I want it, Signy. I want to be with you, then I'm happy. But nothing will be decided tomorrow. You don't know Harald. He will do it. He can't. You replaced the potion? You want me to become Sigurd's wife? No, but it must be solved in a fight. You put your honor above. Don't torment me, Signy. We will always be together. Let the gods decide. It's you, Eynar. Good. It got cold. Put more firewood. With your help Gutbrant, and with yours Selva, we have get rid of Sigurd. When Sigurd leaves the feast, you need to pick a fight with him. He will be unarmed. Do you understand? But if he ... Sigurd is coming. It is me, Tyra. I'm long waiting for Olaf's will to be fulfilled. You forgot about our inconsolable grief, Sigurd. Olaf's bed is still warm. We found it hard to think of something else. I want to make sure before I leave that you haven't forgotten about the promise. We wanted to wait until the feast of Idises. Harald is here. Tomorrow during the feast Harald will announce your engagement. Today I'm going to kill the biggest deer in the mountains. See you at the banquet. From now on you will sleep here, Harald. You gotta start to rule. While you're young, you must obey Guttorm. He is older and wiser than you. I hand him your fate. Tomorrow during the feast, as the eldest in the family, you'll replace your father and fulfill his will. You'll announce the engagement of Sigurd and Signy. The rest lies in the hands of the gods. Let it be so, Harald. You still know little about people. They want the glory and power. He who dominates often hurts other people. But fame still accompanies him. You're not supposed to be a toy in their hands. Promise me you won't leave me. And you don't leave me as well, Thorir. All right. For some reason I don't see Sigurd. He's on the hunt. As the eldest male in the family of Olaf I declare: Signy and Sigurd are engaged! Quietly, Signy. Give Sigurd the horn. Go. To quench his thirst a traveler has little time. A lying wolf won't tear up the prey, a sleeping one won't break the enemy. This horn I drink to the glorious Olaf who was able to keep his word. Catch her Sigurd if you can. I'll catch up. The witch fooled us. Stay aside, Signy! Don't, Sigurd! Speak, Thorir. - A murder. - Who was killed? Selva. Gutbrant is wounded. Who is the murderer? Sigurd. He was unarmed. He snatched the sword from Gutbrant. Sigurd has violated the law of hospitality. He is a guest and has no right to raise a sword. Who pulled the sword from the corpse? Gutbrant. He must take revenge. They refuse to give the arms of Sigurd. Sigurd is outlawed. We'll blow the horn and he will go down to the shore. We won't be able to spend winters here anymore. No one came to see us off. That's Harald. You see, he has honored us. I wonder what he wants? Probably wants to wish us bon voyage. It's a pity Thorir that you are leaving earlier than scheduled, but you see, we have carried out the law of hospitality. It's unfortunate what happened. We are also saddened, Harald. You must hand over Sigurd to us. I do not know where he is. Guttorm with a squad is searching for him. I can give you a ransom. I wouldn't want to part as enemies. Gutbrant must take revenge. Thorir, may I look how you prepare the boat for sail? Also, Einar, Signy is waiting for you in the farmstead. She probably wants to say goodbye. I'm going, Thorir? Go. But be careful. We won't sail without you. Show him what he wants to see. They are looking for Sigurd. He doesn't believe me. Otar, guard Eynar. - Einar went to the house. - Good. Show me what you have in the hold. No need to resist. Give us your weapon. I'm here! Don't forget, we need him alive. Drive him to the barn. Kuksha! Why have you betrayed me? Why did you call me? You she-wolf! Lock him in the armory. Don't worry, Signy. He doesn't understand his own happiness. Now he will always be here with you. You're probably glad Signy? Thorir and Sigurd will leave, and then you can celebrate the wedding with whom you want. I'll kill you, baldy. No need to kill me, Signy. I'll do whatever you ask me. Ride towards Guttorm, he must return quickly. We need to be a lot in numbers. I'm riding to Guttorm. You run to the bank and explain all to Harald. - Well, have you seen all? - Thank you, Thorir. Are you satisfied? Yes. But you have to give us Sigurd. That's the law. I know the law. Well, what is it? Good thing you locked the dog. You can't go in. You must be tired after the fight. Would you like some mead? It's good to be a vigilante. It's better than a slave. I knew you would like it. I'm so glad that you caught Eynar. To your health, Signy. Now he will forever remain with us. What happened? Wait Thorir. You probably want more. Quickly. Kuksha. I hate you. Hurry Levius, and remember what you must tell Thorir. I have a good memory. Farewell, Kuksha. And don't forget the bald man. I'm sorry Thorir, but it turned out like I thought. Eynar decided to stay here. It seems that Signy persuaded him. When you return from your trip, we'll celebrate the wedding of Eynar and Signy. So, you can leave. Well, yes, because you're sure that Sigurd isn't on board. Yes, I'm sure. I want to be sure as well. Let Eynar himself tell us his intentions. He is my adopted son. Yes, but you forced him to leave his home. All right. I will ask him to come. - And if he doesn't want to? - We'll find him. We'll bring him by force. Maybe he's telling the truth. A woman is a woman. No, we'll wait. Eynar didn't go alone. - Where are we running, Signy? - You still don't believe me, Eynar? Wait, Levius! Come here! Where were you going? Tell the truth. I wanted to say goodbye. Why did you come here? Tell the truth! You won't tell. After me. Come. Go on by yourself. Go! I must return home, Signy. Thorir, you'll still hear my good news. Signy isn't to blame for what happened to Eynar. She released him. Blow the horn, and he will come ashore at the Cape. Do not leave without Eynar. I am ... ... no slave ... ... anymore. I am ... ... Levius. Harald defiled his sword. This is Signy's work. The dog. It will follow their track. Take it. Ingrid gave it to me. The one wearing it won't hurt any weapon, and he will always find his way home. I'm glad I met you. Don't forget me. I'll be back, Signy. I'll come back to you. You won't come back. You will become the konung of Gardariki. Many will follow you. You will have many sons and one daughter. She will be your favorite. Promise me that you'll give her this necklace. Do not go away. I beg you. Don't go, I'll die without you. Why must you leave? Good-bye. Forgive me, Signy. No, you forgive me. Leave. The lucky Kuksha. What will happen to you? They won't touch me. Go! Go! You've got to go. Go! Why are you running away from me? The very fate has brought us here. You saved me during the feast. No, not me. Eynar saved you. Are you crazy? You will still be my wife. You will never be my husband. Odin gave me this right, and I'll kill anyone who gets in my way. Me too? What do you mean? I'll never be your wife. I wanted Kuksha, Eynar the lucky. What are you waiting for? Coward. Coward. Coward. We'll be back someday.
