No. I can't live a day without you. But you see me at work every day. It's not enough. I want to live with you. You're crazy. What if they find out about us? Are you so afraid of being found out? If I marry Le-hun, you'll live like a queen. After you marry the chairman's daughter... if you abandon me, I'll kill you. You're mine and I'm yours. Did you forget something? What are you doing here? Is that how you greet me? Of course I'm here to see you... my favorite girl. Looks like you had a good time. Was he the chairman's future son-in-law? If that was him, then it looks like you've struck gold. It has nothing to do with you. It has everything to do with me. Are you trying to set me up? Aw, how can you say that? You bastard! I broke up with you long ago. Get out of here! If you don't, I'll call the police. Please do. Fraud, embezzlement, seduction. You're guilty on every count... and you're calling the police? You put me up to it. How dare you! We broke up a year ago. You've lost your stand to say anything more. Bastard! Yeah, that's me. You're inhuman. Everybody says that. You're a beast! All the women call me that. You devil! Shut up! Don't play dumb. I've tried so hard digging out all these scandals. You want me to keep them in secret? But I do owe you thanks, Tai-giok. About a week ago, I looked in on the chairman at Tai-it Steel. And I saw you in the office at your desk. Go get the sales manager. Yes, sir. Want to go with me to Kaohsiung, Tai-giok? If it's an order... Order? Don't be so serious. Sir? Khe-bing. I want Tsi-sing to go horseback riding with Le-hun. Will that affect your work? No. Here they are. Hi, Uncle. Hello, sir. I'll go with her, sir. OK. Take good care of her. If she falls, her fiancé Mr. Iap will kill you. We've got to go, Dad. Take care of her, Tsi-sing. Okay. Bye, Uncle. Bye Bye Bye. Well, Miss Secretary... I sensed something was wrong with you... so I began to snoop around. When I got to the bottom of it... I found lots of other things too. Here's the evidence. This is the chairman's brother, the sales manager right? Hello? Don't call me at work. How many times do I have to tell you? Why can't our son's mother call his father? Don't play games with me. The nanny wrote and told me that if we don't pay soon... she'll kick him out. What should I do? OK, OK. I'll pay up after work. Really? You're such a good father! He hung up on me. Careful! You are walking on thin ice. When the manager got the call and hurried off to the steel factory... I knew something was wrong. Sir? Tell your sister that I'm a family man, and ask her not to call me for money. What does she think she's doing? I see. The dirty money that you got yesterday... Give me my share! What dirty money? It's your brother's. But that money belongs to the company. If we don't cover ourselves, we'll all get thrown in jail. Damn fool! Here, take it. It gets even more interesting. WHITE PEONY NIGHTCLUB Have a seat. Hong-kiau, Mr. Lau is here. I'll be right there. Two whiskeys. - Okay. Welcome. We have a customer. Have you got the money? This is all I've got. Great. This will cover the doctor bill... But what about child support? Business is slow right now. You'll have to do something. What the hell? My brother's the chairman, but I only work for him. I don't have that much money. Come on. Don't be so cold. Let's go visit our son. You'll love him. What the hell for? We don't even know who his father is. How dare you? I have lots of witnesses. Try me if you don't believe it. That will shut you up but good. Take your money! I'll give it to you later. Don't be mad at me. Let's go upstairs. I'm leaving. Get the money ready as soon as you can. You're a real operator! But what if he wants to see the kid? I'll figure it out. Cheers. Conniving bitch! Women make fools of men. What are you talking about? You're the womanizer! It was getting more and more interesting. She was a proper lady. Why did a pretty woman like her look so sad? So I followed her. She went to an artist's house. What was she doing there? I watched her from the opposite balcony, and discovered their love affair. People get sneakier as they grow older. How shameful for a decent madam like her to do such thing. Unlike this young lady, she was lovely and innocent. Nice picture, isn't it? Don't lose it again. Thank you. You're all sweaty. Here you go. How fragrant! Are you kidding me? What a waste. I'm ruining your handkerchief. It's been fun today. I'll keep you company if you don't mind. What do you mean? You have a fiancé, Mr. Iap. Stop teasing me! Mr. Iap is nice to you. You're nice to me too. A bright young man is wooing her. So I don't think it would mean much if they find out about you and Mr. Iap. You've been using me. Please stop tormenting me! How's that? Tai-giok, we haven't done it... No! Come on. You're my lover, aren't you? Beast! Me? And what about you? You're a slut, nothing but a vixen. You're a beast too, just like me. Get out of here! Fine. Don't ever come begging me for help again. Goodbye. Taxi! Tai-giok, you really are a beast. He can say "Daddy" now. What's wrong? Guat-kui... Hold him. Whatever happens, you know I love you. Khe-bing? Khe-bing! Hello? Yes. It's me. Who's this? I'm Tenn Kong-hui from Pine Manor. You don't know me, but I know something about you. When I was playing with my camera the other day on my friend's balcony.... I happened to see you kiss Dave. I happened to see you kiss Dave. I'll show you if you don't believe me. I heard that you and Dave are cousins. I'll sell you the photos. It's NT$20,000 with the negatives. Or is that too cheap? I'll call you back. Goodbye. TAI-IT STEEL You have a wife and a mistress. I really envy you! Nonsense! Hong-kiau is nothing to me. Then why did you give her money? You arranged for your mistress's brother to be the warehouse supervisor... to get the money from the company for you. That's embezzlement. If you don't want to go public with it... it'll cost you NT$50,000. I'll give you a week. Bring it to me next Saturday. This is my address. At 8 a.m. Bring the money on time, or else. Sorry. Mr. Iap? Mr. Iap? Cheers. - Cheers. You've got to get us the contract for the steel building construction. But I'm merely a general affair manager. It's not up to me to decide. But you're the chairman's future son-in-law. If you put in a good word for us, it'll be very good for my company. You'll be generously rewarded. Someone wants to see you, Mr. Iap. See me? Where? In the opposite room. Excuse me. Is that him? - Yes. I'm sorry to interrupt you. Who are you? I'm Tenn. Have a seat. To be honest... you and I are related. Related? Through Tai-giok. I'm her ex. So it's you. She broke up with you long ago. What are you doing here? Don't play dumb. Here's the deal. Why don't we discuss it in front of the chairman and your fiancée? Blackmailer! How much? NT$50,000. What? NT$50,000? That's much cheaper than having the chairman call the wedding off, isn't it? It's yummy. Thank you. You're very kind. She was just hungry from horseback riding She didn't really mean it. You're teasing me. Tsi-sing. Miss Lau. Let me buy you drinks. No, thanks. Please excuse me. No, stay. I won't tell Mr. Iap that you're having a great time with Tsi-sing. Watch your mouth. I'll drive you home, Le-hun. No, I'm fine. I can go home by myself. No, I'm fine. I can go home by myself. Let's have a drink. Forget about her. She's someone else's fiancée. Hey, ma'am! Tsi-sing and I are flatmates. In our apartment... we all call him "leech". It suits him very well. Come on! That is way too exaggerating. I just love to snoop around. What's wrong with that? At least I'm not sleeping with another guy's woman. I won't sit here and listen to this. I'm going home, ma'am. You take care. After chatting with me, everybody gets mad as hell. Hi there! Mr. Lim, have a seat. Thanks. Has Tsi-sing been here? He left just now. But he never goes home so early. I doubt he went home. He was upset. He must be out drinking somewhere else. He's going to get sloppy drunk. Why? What's wrong? Nothing. It's just... Put it on my tab. All right. Who was that? He's a blackmailer. Scum! If I'd known you love horseback riding, I'd have taken it up long ago. There's still time. Tsi-sing is a good rider. He's bright and cheerful... and very sportsmanlike. Has your father said anything to you? About what? Our wedding. No, not yet. Let's not rush into it. I think it's better like this. But why? I'd like to wait until I know life better. Tsi-sing agrees with me. Someone is asking for you, Mr. Iap. Okay. Excuse me. I'm sorry. It's okay. Your fiancée is a real beauty. Oh, thanks. What about the cash I asked you for? Yeah, here it is. Here it is, NT$30,000. Make sure we get the building contract. Yeah, of course. LAU KHE-TSONG I'm ready, Dad. Dad? What's wrong? You look tired. No, it's nothing. Who was that man? You don't know him. Who was he? You're not yourself today, Dad. Can't you cancel the trip to Kaohsiung? No, our affiliate is waiting. But I'm worried about you. I'll be fine. My secretary Miss Tan is coming with me. Please get me some more handkerchiefs. Oh, I almost forgot. There's someone from the company, sir. Send him in. Please. Thank you. Good evening. I've dealt with everything. Thank you so much. You're welcome. The man who lives with you, Tenn Kong-hui, what kind of man is he? Tenn Kong-hui? A scum who pries into others' affairs. Do you know him, sir? Oh, Tsi-sing! What a surprise! Will you come with us to the train station? Okay. I'll sit in the front. Excuse me. I have to go. Travel safely, Dad. Take care. Take care. Bye, Dad. Miss Tan looked lovely. She kept looking at me. I didn't know why. I felt she was glaring at me. Surely you're mistaken. It's been fun tonight. Sounds like you are in a mood for a drink. Nah...I am alright. You hear me? Hey! Aren't you going to leave it ? I suggest you leave it alone. Who sent you here? None of your business. The lady wants the matter kept as a secret. If so, I think she was the one who sent you here. Or maybe it was her husband? Or her cousin the artist? Shut up! Stop mumbling! Now what do you say? Look at our tattoos. Wow, how pretty! Please, no fighting. Listen up, you two! Tenn Kong-hui doesn't scare so easily. Tenn Kong-hui doesn't scare so easily. Go back and tell whoever asked you to come, I want to see him personally... or else. What did you say? You worthless scumbags! Get out of here! OK. But we'll be back. You're digging your own grave. Bastard! Let's go. Who do you think you are? Goddamn it! Please don't cause trouble here, Mr. Tenn. Sorry, but they started it. Good evening, ma'am. Hey, Tsi-sing. It's you again. Grab me a drink. You've had enough already. It's all right. Let me buy you a drink. What are you sniffing around for? For money. You dirty dog! Yeah, I'm a dog. So what? I'm leaving before more trouble starts. Wait. I'm leaving too. Let's hang out tonight, Mr.Tenn. I'm not in the mood. Come on, we're flatmates. Let's go. Come on. No fussing or fighting, you two! Your dirty business doesn't bother me. But if you disturb Le-hun, I'll definitely hurt you. Understand? You have a huge crush on the chairman's daughter... but it's unrequited love. Is it wrong? No. I celebrate love. But if you don't try harder, you'll never win at love. Thanks for the encouragement, Mr. Tenn... but I really want to slug you. Slug me? Sorry about this. Hey! What the hell is going on? I'm sorry. Stop it. Listen... if anything bad happens to Le-hun, I'll do more than hurt you... I'll kill you. I need more drinks. What's going on? He's a little piece of shit. Don't worry about it. Then, have a good night! Mr. Tenn? Hello, the warehouse supervisor from Tai-it Steel. I've been expecting you. Come on in. You know me? This camera knows you too. You are Li Tsun-siu, the one who engaged in the corruption with the sales manager. You don't look like the type, but what you're doing is truly malicious. So you're the big gun here. No, only a small one. But let me tell you something. If you're not here paying up instead of Lau Khe-bing... nothing you say will matter. Is that so? You don't know who I am. Hey, punk! Don't play dumb. Either wise up or get hurt. You hear me? We're not in the middle of nowhere. Well? You want me to holler? The cops will be right over. Fine. But if you don't lay off, you'll learn the hard way. Sorry, folks... I apologize... for the disturbance. NT$50,000 from the dirty son-in-law... NT$50,000 from the sales manager... Another NT$20,000 from his wife... And NT$100,000 from the chairman. NT$220,000 altogether! Hey. You have to come, don't you? Have a seat. Excuse me. Is Mr. Tenn Kong-hui home? He must be sleeping. What's the smell? The gas is leaking. The gas is leaking... Leaking gas! Come on! The gas is leaking! Hurry! Where is it? Here! This one! Where? This one? Quick! Turn it off! Open the windows! Turn off the gas! It's this one! Hurry! The gas is leaking! The gas is leaking! Hurry! Turn it off! - Come on! What are you doing here, sir? I'm visiting a friend. Excuse me. Is he dead? - He's dead. He's dead. - Is he dead? He's dead. Call an ambulance! He's dead. He's gone. - Excuse me! Call an ambulance! - Kong-hui! What is it? He committed suicide. Mr. Tenn! Mr. Tenn! It's hopeless. I'm calling the police. And an ambulance too. Call an ambulance! Yeah. - It's too late. He's dead. - No one noticed. Why did he do it? Yeah. The police are here... TAIPEI CITY POLICE PATROL CAR My pal Tsi-sing lives in that apartment. My pal Tsi-sing lives in that apartment. I'll help you check out Tenn's past. When I came in, the pot was here. The gas was turned on. This burner was turned on too. That's how it was. So he was asphyxiated. That's weird. AUTOPSY ROOM He died of gas poisoning, and he was drunk. The time of death was... between midnight and 2 a.m. There's a bruise on the back of his head. Look. He was clubbed before he died. That's why it was bruised. It was not a suicide. Tenn Kong-hui didn't commit suicide. The police see it as a murder. It is under investigation. He would never commit suicide. It's thought that he had a fight with someone when he was drunk... then he was knocked out and poisoned with gas. Knocked out? There must have been a fight, but the neighbors didn't hear anything. None of them? So the murderer was stealthy... and didn't make a sound. Who could it have been? That's why... you're a suspect too, you know. Give me a break. I wouldn't be here if I were the murderer. Isn't that right, ma'am? Maybe those two gangsters killed him. All that matters is the evidence. Do you suspect me, Kok-tsun? Tsi-sing, where were you after you beat him up in front of his apartment? I was drinking and walking... to Ximen. You were near the Octagonal Building... at around 10:30? Where after that? I was too drunk to remember anything. When I woke up the next morning, I was lying on a bench in Taipei New Park. The police won't buy that story. They'll arrest you and haul you in. Ah, shit! I told you not to get so drunk. Maybe it was me... Nonsense! Hi. Hey, Lim. Are you here to notify him? You really have a keen sense to the case. Tsi-sing is an old friend of mine. Oh, the case will become trickier. This is Chief Tshuah. Have some tea. Thank you. Tsi-sing, why were you... fighting in front of the apartment? It was over a trivial matter. Will you come with me to the station? All right. As his friend, can I visit him? I'm okay with it... but I can't break department rules. but I can't break department rules. I can't help you. Go with Chief Tshuah. I'll try to find something to clear you. Thanks a lot. - You're welcome. I'll quit drinking from now on, ma'am. Welcome. Have a seat. Here's the money. OK, thanks. Oh no! I'm sorry. This man... Do you know him? He was here drinking last night. He was totally drunk and didn't pay up. What time was it? Around 11. He was half asleep over there. When did he leave? After we closed. When we woke him up... it was past 2 a.m. Great! I've got a witness. Why did you kill him? What the hell? We didn't... ...didn't want him dead. It was a slip-up. Get out of here and find a place to hide. We need money to go on the lam... NT$10,000 ought to do it. How dare you come to my house? Please help me, cousin. I don't have a choice. I've made up my mind. I'll tell everything to my husband. Think about it, madam. Don't destroy your family for such a small amount of money. Yeah, that's right. Please leave me alone. So you don't have the money? Wait. You want money? Here it is. Get out! Khe-bing... Go! Don't... ...resort to violence. When did you establish these relations? Relations? How can you say that? About half a month ago... when I was putting away your suits, I found a pawn ticket for a Rolleiflex camera. I wonder what it is for. So I asked my cousin to look into your secrets. Look who has come! I'm terribly upset. What's wrong? I don't know what Khe-bing's been doing. He never tells me. I think he's cheating on me. A pretty wife, and he wants a lover too? Khe-bing is a bastard. What a shame! Looking back, if I hadn't gone off to study in France... you would be my wife now. Guat-kui... I've been waiting for you. Guat-kui... You... You... Guat-kui... What are you doing? Let me go! I don't know when Tenn Kong-hui took the picture. He blackmailed me for NT$20,000. I didn't want to tear the family apart. I was sad. Khe-bing... I didn't want to destroy our happy family... but my ex-girlfriend threatened me. I have nothing to do with her now. Please trust me. I trust you, Khe-bing. Khe-bing! - Guat-kui! A police officer is here. Come on in. No, thanks. I won't be long. Have two men come to visit you? They go by "Turtle" and "Snake." No. Khe-bing? Khe-bing? Khe-bing... Hello, sir. No news yet. It's okay. We've got something. Your reward, fresh squid. Great! - Great. Let's go. - Yes, Chief. I think Turtle and Snake have blackmailed Lau Khe-bing's wife. I think they're trying to run away. trying to run away? they're probably in a brothel. Oh? Let's go. Great. Now it's my turn. Have a drink, officer? No, thanks. We haven't broken any laws. Good. Come with me. Why did you threaten Tenn Kong-hui? What? We threatened him? He threatened us! You're useless. Where else have you been? We... We... Where? We visited our boss... for this. Your boss? - Yes, sir. Good. Yeah. They got some money from somewhere, and came here late at night. Don't lie to us, Boss. But why should I lie? They were gambling with those young guys. Come on. Ready? You first. Take it. That jackass always cheats at gambling. so he got into it with my boys. I won! Hit him! Hit him! Knocked him out! Hit him! - Stomp him! Cheater! Kill the bastard! Stop pretending! I'll teach you a lesson! Don't come over here again! Don't you come over here! Get up! Stop pretending! There's one more! - Over there! Stop! Give us the money! Don't! Kill him! Don't! - Kill him! Kill him! What the hell are you doing? The boss is here. They were exhausted from fighting, so they stayed here overnight. We'll be on our way.. Please stop by anytime. So the second suspects are innocent. Tsi-sing told me on that morning... Iap Boo-siong was pacing back and forth in front of the apartment. Is he the third suspect? Excuse me. The third suspect: Iap Boo-siong. TAIPEI STATION I've got to go. See you again. Bye. You're back, sir. Sorry, I'm late. You've been busy. You've lost weight on this business trip. Yes. Are you feeling unwell? No. An old man gets tired easily. I saw the news that he was killed. I'm wondering if you murdered him. Mr. Iap? I'm from the police. Can I have a few words with you? Let's go. OK. A friend of mine lives in Pine Manor. Can't I go there? Of course you can... but why would you leave when you saw Tsi-sing? I thought of something important. You were out that night, weren't you? I was visiting a friend. When was it? I went there at 10 p.m. and got back at dawn. Let's go talk to that friend of yours, OK? You don't want to? All right, I'll take you there. We're leaving, Miss. Bye. Bye. Bye. - Bye. You're still up? What do you want? Do you know this man? I don't know him. I'm Hui-tsu's colleague. I stayed upstairs last night. That's strange. So you can fly? I was sleeping here and I didn't know? Mr. Iap... this spells trouble for you. Can you call Hui-tsu down, please? She's asleep. Where are you going? Hui-tsu! Was Mr. Iap here with you... from 10 p.m. last night to dawn? No, he was not. How can you say that? Don't be ashamed. How was that? Was he here with you? No. Tell him the truth, Hui-tsu... or I'll go to jail. Is that what you want? Show some sympathy! You might be carrying my child. What will you do if I'm in jail? Tell him, Hui-tsu! Tell him the truth! Come on! So, what is the truth? Yes, he was here. It's all out now! Thank you so much, Hui-tsu. How did you get upstairs? I came in through that window. At 10 o'clock last night... it was windy and chilly. What's that? What's that noise? Damn it all... Who's there? Damn cat! If you wreck the roof... I'll kill you for sure. Did you really hear a cat? I promise I'll marry you, Hui-tsu. The fourth suspect: Li Tsun-siu. Don't lie to me. Tsun-siu told me he was here drinking. When was it? After 10 o'clock. You're his sister. Keep quiet. It was 11:20. You remember the exact time? Business was slow that night. We didn't have many customers. Hi, bro. Bring me a drink! Kim-ki? Don't drink too much, okay? You don't have the money. Shut up! I have this watch. They can keep it as a pledge. Does it run? It's 11:20. It does run! Shut up! I'm not in the mood. He was upset all night long... cursing someone called Tenn. When did he stop drinking? Around midnight. Then he went straight home? No, he slept here. Hey, officer... they're pretty close. How close? To be honest, he's a nice guy. That's enough out of you. Come on. Let's go. Don't you want something sweet, officer? I'm not in the mood. The sales manager next, right? I think he's innocent. He's well-behaved since he got married. He used to be a good-for-nothing. Isn't that the sales manager? WHITE PEONY NIGHTCLUB What do you want? I need some money. I'm on the run. Ridiculous! Believe it or not, bring me the money now. I don't have the money. What's going on? Where's Mr. Lau? He headed that way. So all the suspects are innocent now? Yeah, that's why we suspect Mr. Lau. Unless he has a witness... or we have a sixth suspect... otherwise, he's going to jail. But it's still under investigation. The morning after the murder, Mr. Lau was at a store across the way... asking where Pine Manor was, right? If he's the murderer... would he forget where he killed someone the night before? It's just my assumption. I'm not sure if he's the murderer. We have to find more evidence. I have his photo here with me. Take it. It might work. Yes, that's right. Is that him? It's him. Thank you. - Wait. Did you mistake him? This lady asked for Pine Manor the other day too. When? The night before Tenn Kong-hui was murdered. If I can help my husband... just tell me how. On the night that Tenn was killed... were you at Pine Manor? Yes, I was. I couldn't get the money he asked for, so I went there to beg him for sympathy. Did you meet him? No, I didn't. Why not? Because I hesitated. I had never met him before. I was scared. When I tried to knock on the door, I heard footsteps. So I decided to go home... But as I passed his door, I heard him talking to someone inside. I don't know what they were talking about... but I'm sure it was a woman's voice. A woman? What a twist! We have one more suspect. Please excuse me. The sixth suspect: Tan Tai-giok. Hello, Mr. Lau. I know it's late. I'm sorry. It's okay. Have a seat. Thank you. On your business trip to Kaohsiung... was Tan Tai-giok on the same train as you? As far as Tainan. What do you mean? We only got one sleeper train ticket, so Miss Tan and my dad weren't in the same train car. Right, Dad? That's right. I rode in the sleeper at the back, but she had a seat in the fifth car. The meeting began at 2 p.m. There was plenty of time. She visited her relatives in Tainan. What's wrong? Nothing. But Mr. Lau... did you go straight to your affiliate? No, I felt tired. So I rested in the hotel. What about Miss Tan? She arrived in the hotel at around 10 a.m. We attended the meeting together in the afternoon. Sorry to bother you. It's okay. - Thank you. Excuse me. I'll see myself off. What is it, Dad? It's nothing. Do you have a fever? Let's see. No, it's cool. I'm sorry if I've troubled you. I didn't see things clearly. However hard Iap Boo-siong tried to pretend... I should've known what kind of man he was. It's OK, Dad. I didn't like him anyway. Tsi-sing was right. It's up to me to choose whom I'll marry. Then how about Tsi-sing? Good, good. Who is it? I'm from the police. I have some questions for you. Have a seat. What a lovely suite. Thank you. Have a seat. Thanks. On your business trip to Kaohsiung, I heard you made a stop in Tainan? Yes, I had some errands to run. I told the chairman on the previous night. Didn't you make a stop in Taoyuan? How could that be? Well, I think you did. A police officer should tell the truth. Can you prove that you stopped in Tainan? Of course I can. I visited my cousin. Can you give me your cousin's address? No. 66, East Dist., Donglin Rd., Tainan City. Tan Sui-an. No. 66, East Dist., Donglin Rd... District One Police station. Hurry. Well? Is there a Tan Sui-an? There's no such person in Tainan City, and that address doesn't exist either. Shit! Over here, Chief! I'm picking you up in the newspaper agency's car. If we don't hurry up, Tai-giok will escape. Smart fellow! How would you know I was going for Tai-giok? I read your mind. You fool! Be careful! Don't scratch it! Do you know where the owner has gone? She's getting married back in Tainan. You've got this stuff cheap, didn't you? Yeah...so what about it? Can't I make a profit out of it? Tai-giok... we grew these grapes at our villa. They're a delicious, foreign variety. Enjoy them. Hello? Tai-it Steel? Please put me through to Tsi-sing in Sales Department. Sales Department. It's me. Oh, Kok-tsun. Does the chairman own a villa? Yes? Where is it? In Tianmu. What? Grapes? Yeah, I think so. Hello? Hello? What's wrong with him? My god! It appears to be a suicide using potassium cyanide. Perfume. It smells different. It's not hers. Damn! She was murdered. Poison... Find the poison. Find it. It's in here. If she was murdered... check for other fingerprints. FINGERPRINTS ANALYSIS ROOM We only found the victim's fingerprints... no one else. No? That's weird. Tai-giok killed Tenn and we came for her, so she committed suicide. It makes sense. But it doesn't seem quite right. You're sniffing the handkerchief again. Tai-giok's ghost might appear! The chairman sent the grapes to Tai-giok... and Tai-giok died in his villa. It proves Tai-giok and the chairman had a special relationship. Besides, no one but the chairman... and his daughter can enter the villa. I don't think Tai-giok committed suicide. Do me a favor. Find out if this belongs to Le-hun, okay? Find out if this belongs to Le-hun, okay? Uh...alright. I'm looking deeper into the business trip. If Tai-giok stopped in Taoyuan and came back to Taipei to kill Tenn, the chairman must have followed her. He'd never let her get off by herself. Any man would follow his mistress. Maybe he witnessed the murder. Do me this favor. You got it. Thanks a lot. Hey, Kok-tsun. You called for me? I have to talk to you. How can I help you? Well, I... Have you ever seen this handkerchief? No, I haven't. Smell it. What's with this handkerchief? It was beside Tai-giok's dead body. What? Is it Le-hun's perfume? Yes. Oh, no! I'm afraid that Le-hun will become the suspect of Tai-giok's murder. How can it be? Kok-tsun! Kok-tsun! So I'm here to talk to your daughter. I see. I knew you'd come sooner or later. I knew you'd come sooner or later. I killed them both. I knew it. I'm ashamed! I've never thought that at my age... I'd let myself be seduced by Tai-giok. We met once a week at my Tianmu villa. Tenn Kong-hui saw us together. The night I went to Kaohsiung, he squeezed me for $100,000, and claimed that Tai-giok was his woman. Please be civil. I'm her ex. I don't have to be nice to you. I had her before you did. I was furious. If I could solve the problem with money, I would give it to him. But when the train was leaving Taoyuan... You told me you're stopping in Tainan. Why are you getting off in Taoyuan? I knew she was meeting Tenn Kong-hui. I couldn't help being jealous. So you got off in Zhongli and followed her in a taxi to Pine Manor? Yes. What is it? Come on. I can't tell if you want it or not. Fine. What do you want? You want me to lay off Iap Boo-siong? Let's make an exchange, okay? Don't mix love with business. Let's get back together. How about it? I'll make you even prettier than before. Yeah, I do think of you once in a while. I'm flattered. Kong-hui... I thought she had killed Kong-hui... and I was glad. He's still alive! I have to put an end to him. Ah, the gas. I caught a taxi to Kaohsiung right away, but she got to the hotel before I did. Did Tai-giok sense something wrong? The news said he was poisoned by gas, so she must have sensed it. But she didn't call me until last night. She wanted to meet me at my villa. Where are you going in such a rush, Dad? I have to go to the office. What are you looking for? I forgot my handkerchief. Take mine. Then I'll use yours. The police had already put it together, but Tai-giok wasn't worried at all. Have the police talked to you? Yeah, they keep harassing me. That's why I came here. Is that okay? Of course it is. You met Kong-hui secretly the other night. Was that right? How did you know that? I saw you get off in Taoyuan. Why didn't you say something? You must be jealous. You don't worry about anything. It wasn't me who killed him. Living in Kaohsiung would be nice. I'll take you there when it's over. No, thanks. I'll go alone. I'm losing interest in you. Don't leave me, Tai-giok. I feel loved only when I'm with you. Tai-giok... But I don't want you. You can't satisfy me. You're not manly enough. I don't like it. Come on. Let's end this, okay? Give me NT$100,000. Are you upset? What...what did you say? Isn't it better than going to jail? You... You... You... I know you killed Kong-hui. What are you talking about? I've found out everything. Come on. Let's dance. Come on. Come on, get with it. Let's dance. Come on! Okay? Is NT$100,000 too much? That's too low. I'm raising it. Now it's NT$150,000. You'll give me as much money as I want. NT$200,000? NT$300,000? Wow! Your eyes are popping out. Mr. Lau... please come to the station with us. Fine. I'll go change. Is it okay? What are you doing here? Dad! May I read it? Dad... To my dearest daughter Le-hun... When you read this letter... I'll no longer be here in this world. You're my only daughter. I could've enjoyed a happy life with you. I could've enjoyed a happy life with you. I don't know what I was thinking. A woman seduced me and I lost my head. It led me to where I am now. I'm too ashamed to face the world. Before I die, I couldn't show you how much I love you. That is my greatest regret. I hope that you'll muster the courage and strive to lead a good, happy life. Have a family with Tsi-sing and continue to run my business. Love, Dad. December 20. Dad... why didn't you think of me? Mom passed away long ago. Now you're gone too, leaving me all by myself. How will I survive? Whom will I depend upon? Dad! Dad... Calm down, Tsi-sing. Come to your senses. You have to take care of Le-hun. Make her happy. That is your responsibility. THE END
