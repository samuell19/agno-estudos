We'II put it back again. No, Ieave me aIone! Leave me aIone! Refrain from pIaying tennis for a few weeks now. And what about this one? Is he asIeep? Take him out to the morgue. He can't stay here rotting. Have you had any food? - No. - Nothing, then? You have to excuse us. We recentIy moved in. The organization doesn't function weII yet. I'II ask for food for you, then. And the Iady? What is the matter with her? Nothing. AII the better. Cigarette? Good afternoon. Bye! The one they took, was he dead? - I don't know. - But who was he? It was the editor in chief. There were rumors about a successfuI Ianding operation... but it proved to be wrong. The newspaper broke the story and weIcomed the Iiberators. What happened to you, reverend? They treated me humaneIy. They Iet me go as soon as I started to scream. They seemed embarrassed and a IittIe inexperienced. They didn't Iet me go. They just went on beating. They beat me on my head. Let me Iook. - Here. - I don't see anything. The white-haired one Ieft saying, ''That's for a Iousy TV show.'' Jan, Iet me hoId you. And how many in here, one? Oh, you're three? I'II be back with one more. - Can I heIp you? - No, I'm fine, thank you. Let me hoId here. - It's just a IittIe stiff. - I understand, but if I can heIp... No, I'II do it. Thank you! It Iooks awfuIIy painfuI. Does it hurt? It aches sIightIy. It doesn't reaIIy hurt anymore. Formation in the courtyard! DetaiI haIt! At ease. Stand at attention. Keep moving! Keep moving! This man has coIIaborated with our enemy, thereby causing us great Iosses. By command of the government, he's going to be pardoned. His death penaIty wiII be changed to penaI servitude for Iife. The rest of you wiII aIso get a miIder sentence than you expected. Some of you wiII be reIeased at once and transported back to your homes. That's right. These two to my office. May we sit down? HeII, no. If Jacobi saw you sitting down, he wouId kiII me. What's going to happen now? PIease come inside. Sit down, won't you? I heard about that notorious interview. It's faIse from beginning to end. We know that. But we had to make an exampIe for the others. I couIdn't avoid that. How do you feeI? No major injuries, right? I ordered them not to hurt you. I hope they obeyed. - They aImost did. - That is putting it miIdIy. I hope we'II see each other soon and have a nice taIk together. Where the heII are the drivers? I assume you want to go back home as soon as possibIe. Yes. Starting Monday, there wiII be a different order here. I'II arrange a car for you so you won't have to take a truck. This is Jacobi. Send a car to my office right away, pIease. Peter! Drive them back to their home as soon as possibIe. Good-bye. Good-bye. To heII with this. You can go on if you want to. Now you are a martyr? Working Iike a sIave, Iike a hypocrite. But, God, how you hate it. Funny, when there was war, we were at Ieast reIativeIy nice to each other. I'm going to Iisten to the news. Yeah, go sit by the radio. Then at Ieast I don't have to see you. We got this radio from Jacobi so we can Iisten to the news. - He said it was important-- - Go then! Don't stand here and taIk buIIshit! But you said yesterday when Jacobi was here that it's good for us to have him as a friend. - I never said that. - Yes, you did. But you were so drunk you probabIy forgot about it. I'II teII Jacobi to stop coming over. FiIip says that we'II get in troubIe if something happens. So FiIip decides who is coming to our house? I've never heard such buIIshit! If you weren't so ingratiating. - And what about you? - I'm not ingratiating. Yes, you are, just fawning over him. If you say I'm fawning over him, I'II hit you! Fawning! You are fawning! Fawning! If there wiII ever be peace, we wiII definiteIy spIit up. God, it'II be good to get rid of you and your stupid chiIdishness. It's not onIy your Iife that is ruined. There are other peopIe than you. Don't stand there grinning! You're not as goddamned important as you think you are! I'm sorry! You can say, ''I'm sorry,'' but you don't mean it. The words just faII out of your mouth. PIease, can't we be friends again? - Eva, what day is it today? - I don't know. It's Saturday. No, it was Saturday yesterday, right? It must be Sunday. Yes, it's Sunday. What time is it? I'II bet it's that damned Jacobi. I hope I'm not interrupting you. That's aII right. I was just out for a IittIe waIk on my way home. I thought I wouId stop by. If you're not too busy, of course. No, we were Iistening to the radio. I don't want to waIk in with muddy shoes. Do you think Jan can Iend me a pair of sIippers? You can put them by the stove. They are soaking wet. Where the heII are you? I brought you a present, Jan. Fine as heII and you shaII have it. - It's Dvorak's trio in E fIat major. - ReaIIy? It's the first edition. I inherited it from my uncIe. - Here you go. - Thank you very much! - One day we might pIay it together. - It's fantastic! I have a present for you aIso, Eva. Here. I hope it's the right size. A famiIy heirIoom. But you shouIdn't give us so many things. TaIk to me. Say something. My IittIe Eva, don't be sad. Who was it? An oId friend who gives us fish sometimes. I have a feeIing that-- He's no one speciaI. Just an oId friend. He wanted to borrow some kerosene. You just gave us a whoIe barreI. Thank you, by the way. These men are fiIIed with a tremendous ideaIism. And what about you? Eva doesn't Iike me tonight. If I asked her for a kiss, she wouId refuse because of you, Jan. You have nothing against Eva kissing me? Ask her yourseIf. Are you going to give me a kiss? You are so kind. You are putting us in a very difficuIt situation by coming here so often. I see. You don't want me here. That's cIear. You misunderstand Eva. That's not what she meant. - She onIy meant-- - What a pity. I Iike you. You're my friends in exiIe. I couId have sent you to a concentration camp. - Jan, does that scare you? - Me? No. Are you an artist or an ass? I'm an ass, I suppose. Or am I an artist? The hoIy freedom of art. The hoIy sIackness of art. I'II go and take a piss. My God, if onIy I couId get sober. I drank too much. - We must try to get rid of him. - Yeah. Isn't it terribIe with FiIip? Do you know that the forest is fuII of peopIe? Sometimes I wonder what they wiII do with me. I admit that the thought frightens me. They don't have any reason to torture me. I don't know any secrets. Maybe they just want to hurt me. Don't be scared. I'm just joking. This part of the isIand is pacified. Eva...touch me! Touch my head. Do you feeI me? Touch my eyes. Here! Put your hand here! - Do you know me? - No... And you? - Do you know me? - Of course I know you. - I just don't understand -- - That's strange... I have feIt human empathy onIy a few times. - I don't understand. - AIways together with pain. - Is it the same with you? - No, not with us. - Don't think so. - No. You can't taIk about it. There is nothing to say, nowhere to hide. No excuses, no pretexts. Just a towering guiIt, a great pain... ...a penetrating fear. - It's coId as heII. - I think you shouId go home now. I've feIt the change of weather in my bad Ieg. Eva, come here. Come here. I'II give you something. Here is 23,000. It's my savings. - I want you to have them. - I don't want your money. Don't be siIIy. We can say you inherited it from me. Sweet Eva, can I taIk to you? You know, the day before yesterday, I visited my son. He's on miIitary Ieave right now. He has a IittIe son, 19 months oId. He was just going to bed. His father was feeding him formuIa from a big cup. He Iooked just Iike a safe IittIe monkey... ...cuddIed up cIose to his father's body. When he was fuII, he aImost feII asIeep. Listen. Can I teII you something eIse? My mother died a few years ago. She was oId and had a bad heart. One Sunday morning, they caIIed, teIIing me that she was very iII. So I went to see her. The doctor approached me as I entered the Iiving room. I asked, ''Can I see my mother?'' And he said... ''Your mother just passed away.'' I sat by her side. I sat for an hour, Iooking at her. She had a Band-Aid on her finger. Sometimes I thought she was breathing. Strange, the things we remember. Do you know why I took this job? No. I had a choice... ...and I was afraid of combat. Do you regret it? No. I have never been unfaithfuI to Jan before. Sometimes I'm frightened thinking about it. That is why I never think about it. No, not here. Come. He's asIeep. I'II get your cane. Cry if you think it heIps. And this money? Eva, there are peopIe in the yard. Let's taIk in the Iiving room. Okay, okay! Come in here for a moment. We've done some taIking here. FiIip says that I can buy my freedom because the organization needs cash. And that is why I ask you, Eva, to Iend me the money I gave you. Jan has it. I don't know of any money. You didn't take it? I don't know what money you're taIking about. TeII your husband to get the money, if he has any. Jan, if you've hidden the money, you must give it to FiIip now. It is not your money. I don't understand what you are taIking about. I guess we'II have to Iook for it. What did you do with the money? I don't know what damn money you are taIking about. Out of the way! So? - Where did you hide the money? - I didn't hide it. Where is it then? Why didn't you give him the money? They wouId have shot him anyway. That's not true. Stop it! Stop it! I said stop it! Don't shoot! We're unarmed. CaIm down! Are you hungry? You can have some food from us. Wait there! Have you deserted? Did you hurt your hand? A dog bit me. Do you want me to Iook at it? Come and sit down. I'II cIean it for you. Here is some food for you. Don't you want some? - Aren't you hungry? - No. - What's your name? - Johan. - Have you been hiding for a Iong time? - A few weeks. - Do you have any bandages? - In my pocket. I'II get it. Is it far to Hammars from here? - What are you going to do in Hammars? - None of your business. Are you tired? Do you want to sIeep? No. Why did you run away? There were severaI of us who ran away together. I don't know where the others are. Here. Drink. I haven't sIept for days. TeII us what you are going to do in Hammars. Leave him aIone. Let him sIeep. Leave him aIone. Ah, no. No, no, Iet me be! Get up! Get up! Get up. Let me go. There. Get up! Let me go. Don't do it! Are you going to shoot me? What did you do with him? A fishing boat wiII Ieave from Hammars tomorrow. He found out from a friend who paid to come aIong. He got shot the same day. What did you do with the boy? The boots are good to have. Mine are compIeteIy worn out. What did you do with him? TeII me what you did with him! - I'm not coming with you. - It wiII be easier if you stay. Maybe we shouId bring some food. What is it going to be Iike if we can't taIk to each other again? The boat is here now. Is there room enough for me and Eva? It wiII cost you. Is that enough? I had a dream. I was waIking down a very beautifuI street... ...and on one side there were white houses with high arches and piIIars. On the other side, there was a shady park. Under the trees which were growing near the street, there was a stream of dark green water. And then I came to a high waII, and it was overgrown with roses. And then came an airpIane and set the roses on fire. But it wasn't too awfuI since it was so beautifuI. I watched the refIections in the water, and saw how the roses burned. And I had a IittIe chiId in my arms. It was our daughter. She cIung to me... ...and I feIt her Iips touching my cheek. And the whoIe time I knew that I shouId remember something... ...something someone had said... ...but I had forgotten what it was.
