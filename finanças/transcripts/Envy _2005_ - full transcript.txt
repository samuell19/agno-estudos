Look, this man is under protective custody. He's gonna be moved as soon as his condition is stabilized. Can I talk to you outside for just a second? Please. [TV in background] - [TV] Good morning, this is Rochelle Mann for Channel Six News. We have a developing story from northwest Detroit where three unidentified African American males and one African American female were shot during the early morning hours in what is being called a grisly home invasion. Hospital officials report that one of the victims is in a coma with little to no chance of recovery. Detroit police do not have any suspects in custody at this time but do believe that the shooting was a drug related robbery gone bad. We will bring you the full story as well as the condition of the victims live today at 12 noon. - Baby don't you want to get dressed at least? - Not right now, baby. Can a nigga get a little time to himself? Close the door behind you. - Oh you want me to close your door? - Yeah. - I'll close your door. - Thank you. [sobbing] - Everything gonna be all right. It gonna be all right, ma. Everything gonna be all right. - Hey, could you use some help? - Man y'all tripping. I can walk. - Oh really? Then we're making progress. Thanks, I'll take it from here. - Man. I thought I was dreaming or hallucinating. That was you earlier, huh? - Yeah. Now its time to get you up out of here. You ready? - Up out of here? Where we going? - A safe place where you can recover. - What's the catch? - Look we have a long ride up there. We can talk about this on the way, AJ. - Can I have a minute to think about it? - Okay, you have 20 minutes. Make up your mind. I'll be in the cafeteria. - All right. - Was it worth it? This is it, Alvin. This is your opportunity to start on a new direction. - A new direction? What by being a punk? - No by doing something positive with your life. - Ma, you don't understand. Look I love the streets. I love the respect I get when I walk in the clubs or when I pull up in my new car. My people envy me - Do they envy you now, all shot up laying in the hospital? What's wrong with you? You have to make a decision, Alvin. If you go back to the streets, I'm not going to support you anymore. [birds chirping] - Are you sure you're ready to try some of my cooking? - Hell yeah. Shit I'm tired of being fed through a straw. - All right, here it is. - Nah, nah. I'ma eat it in there. Hold on. [groaning] fuck it, man. - What's wrong, are you okay? - Yeah I'm cool. Hand me some of them weights over there. Now you know I'm gonna need more weights than that. - Don't you think you're trying a little too much too fast? - Tommie, just hand me the weights. - Okay. Okay, AJ, wait stop. Look, I'm not gonna let you kill yourself, okay? I'm not gonna stand here and watch you kill yourself. You got to take things slow. I'm going to bed. [somber reflective music] - You know the industry territory? - Yeah. - That's you now. You have 10 soldiers reporting to you. All you got to do is supply and collect, collect, collect... You got to do what they can't do, what they aint got the heart to do. - Nigga, I did what you aint had the heart to do, motherfucker, motherfucker... - That aint heart, killing niggas we love. - I brought your motherfucking ass in this game and I'll take you out, nigga. Get the fuck out my office, man. - Its like that? - Get the fuck out, fuck out, fuck out... [somber reflective music] - Talking about some hoes. Niggas can't use no cell phones in the wilderness and shit, motherfuckers got to run out to the outhouse and use cans with the strings and shit to talk to the motherfucker. - Get this blunt rolled up real quick. - Where your hoe man? What time we at man? What time does business come in here and strip? [laughing] - Shit. Damn, that was really funny. - Fake ass pimp with no hoes, nigga. - Hey but on the real, word in the streets, your ass is dead, nigga. - Oh yeah? - For real. - Yeah look, I'ma be ready to make moves real soon. - Oh fo sho? - Fo sho, my nigga. Its time. Its time to take over the whole operation but I need y'all to do a couple things with me first, aight? - Slay me, my nigga. - I need y'all to pledge y'all loyalty back to Caesar. - You're tripping. - No listen, listen. He'll put you back on because my soldiers will follow you. Understand, y'all gonna be followed so y'all got to do all that necessary shit to prove you're down. You feel me? And once they loosen up, once y'all back in, I need y'all to find out everything y'all can about the operation, especially that nigga Rio. Can you handle that? - That's a done deal, baby. Got you, got you. - Roll up. - AJ? - Yeah. - I know you're not going back, are you? I wish you could be here for me, Alvin. - I got to go, Tommie. - When am I testifying? - What I'm supposed to do? Lay my life on the witness protection program? For real? I didn't get no degree at Michigan State. I got my degree on the streets. All I know how to be is a street nigga. - Can't you forget about the money? - Its not about the money, Tommie. - What is it about? - Its about the respect I get on the streets. Its about the look in people's eye when I pull up and drop like two Gs without blinking. Niggas envy me. - Envy? - Yeah that's right, envy. - They won't envy your ass when you're dead. Or locked up. - Hey. - What's up, baby? - How you feel? - Aight. - Sure? Maybe you should see him. - What? - Go see your cousin, Caesar. - You're right, I should go see him. - You know you didn't mean for it to go down like this. What's wrong with going to see him? - You trying to gas me up. - Well? - I'll go see him. Say how you doing. - You promise? - Yeah. - Okay. [people chattering] - Hi, how you folks doing tonight? Would you like anything else with your entrees? Well just call me if you need anything. - Hey yo, C. I need to holler at you, man. - State your business. - Look, C. I'ma cut to the chase, man.

You know if a nigga gets out of line, you know, we got to straighten his ass out. Straight up. You know what I'm saying? - Fo sho, you know we do, nigga. - So all these niggas missing is a little bit of leadership. I'm that nigga to give it to em. - Why are you looking like that? - No reason. I just thought your son took care of you. - Don't come around here acting all high and mighty and shit just because I ask you for some money. Your son is selling rocks like the rest of em. - Alvin learned his lesson. - You don't know? You don't know, do you? AJ's back in business. That's right. All those years you spent telling me if it was my son, I'd do this, or I'd do that. Well?
