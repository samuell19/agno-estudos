Here we are. Belinda, I am .. - Don't say anything. Goodnight, dear. Belinda. Where have you been? Where have you been? It is after half past ten. Goodnight, aunt Esther. It is getting late. Yes. By George, yes. It is a quarter to eleven. I wonder what can have happened to Bob. He ought to be back by this time. Good evening, Jenkins. - Good evening, Mr Melford. Is the family still up? - Yes, sir. Lord Farrington and Mrs Melford are in there, sir. Thank you. Hello, darling. - Hello, Rosamond. Evening, guvnor. Hello, my boy. How was the cinema? Oh, fair. Isn't it your bedtime, dear? I suppose it is. Goodnight Rosamond, my dear. Goodnight, dear. Darling, this is much more than I expected. And it is much more than you deserve, of course. A millstone. That is what I am, darling. A millstone round your neck. I've never seen on with such dimples. Or such blue eyes. - Nevertheless. That is what you married. - Nonsense. You mustn't talk like that. You mustn't even think like that. Jenkins, have someone take Mike to the kennels, will you. Certainly, Mr Barrow. - Thank you. Hello, Edward. Will you join me in a nightcap? - Thanks. I will, yes. I am sorry to see you leave us, Edward. I had begun to look on you as one of the family. Meaning I have stayed that long? Meaning I like you that much. Coming from you, that means a lot to me. Hello, Tubbs. - Hello, Bob. I looked for you after dinner. I wanted to take you into town. Yes? I was in my room working. Then I decided to take a walk. Some writers tell me they get ideas that way. I never seem to get anything but .. Wet feet. Sorry I missed you. Yes. Too bad, isn't it. What do you think? Of course it is very flattering that you'd want my help, darling. But I don't know why. I don't know anything about novels. It is a woman's point of view I want, you see. It is one that's got me stuck. You see, the situation is this. There is a girl and a man. And the man's wife. That is not very new, is it? No novel is new. It is the treatment of it that counts. It so happens that in this situation .. The man's wife is an invalid. So naturally, the man turns to the girl, who is very lovely. I'm sure I can't be of any help to you on this, Tubbs. If I were writing for the cheap magazines I'd fill it full of .. Jealousy and excitement and whoop-de-do. But unfortunately. These people are ladies and gentlemen. It is the girl I am worried about. I don't know how to handle her. What kind of a girl is she? I mean .. does she love the man or .. Or you think she's just an adventuress? - Oh no. She is a grand person. Grand. Whether she loves the man or not I haven't been able to decide. I should think if she is the sort of person you said she was. She must love the man very much. Yes. Of course. Yes, she must. There are several roads the story could take. Of course, the man could leave his wife and elope with the girl. But in that case I'm afraid the broken-hearted shadow of the wife .. Would always be between them and they would never be happy. Tubbs, I don't want to talk about your story. Then on the other hand, of course. The girl might break with the man and go away. It would be tough on her. And tough on the man. And on the wife if the man was too miserable. I don't see any solution. But I hate to see three characters I love in a situation like this. Why don't you give it up then? Oh, let's forget it. I've got an idea. Why don't you write a story that can have a happy ending? No. It's started and it has got to finish. I would like to know what is going to happen though. I suppose it depends on .. What the girl decides to do. Yes. Of course it does. What are you going to do, Linda? I don't know. Tubbs, dear. I don't know. What would you do? If I knew I would tell you. I wouldn't ask you. Hmm. My father would know, wouldn't he. - Yes. Oliver might know. I will go to him. I'll leave for Naples tomorrow. Linda. Linda, I have found it. It is the most valuable document .. I have ever discovered. Come here, Linda. It is more beautiful I think .. Than even the great Dionysus Argos in the Vatican. It extends you see. From the 9th verse of The Aeneid. Down to the bottom of the book. No modern hand would have the patience to do such work. These moderns who are in such a hurry to get .. They know not where. But you are not listening. No, father. - What is it? Oliver. We have always been good friends, haven't we. Yes, Linda. I mean. We have been close. No trace of misunderstanding at all. I sometimes think I have kept you too close to me. Burying you in my books and .. In my work. Why, even during that one little holiday I let you take in England. I caught myself being out of sorts. Because you weren't here to help me. I like to be with you. I can talk to you. Not to anyone else. I've never been able to talk to anyone but you. That is my fault. I have taught you to depend on me. Instead of relying on yourself. It is not just your training. It is because .. Well, you see, I .. I am the sort of person who .. Who can't wear her thoughts on her tongue. I know that. But Linda dear. Every person must learn to face realities. Unafraid and alone. I like it the way it's been, Oliver. I've had had you. And you are all I've needed. I wonder. I have always known I could come to you with anything. With a cut finger or .. Then it is something more serious this time, Linda? I'm afraid so. Oliver. I have got a problem I can't solve. I know you can tell me what to do. I .. Oliver. Father. Father, what is it? Oliver! Do you remember this? No. No. I don't think I do. Rome. September. Three years ago. Oh yes. A rainy afternoon. - Yes. When Oliver found this in a little second-hand shop. He got so excited he forgot his umbrella. Dear Oliver. He was so sweet. He adored you. He said you were the most evolved man he'd ever met. I would rather have that than the Nobel prize. We did have fun that time, didn't we. Yes. Didn't we. Remember the view of the bay from your window? I never want to see that bay again. You must get over that. It is much too beautiful to be made a bogey of. I don't want to think of it even. Darling, if you remember something that connects you with an unbearable moment. You must take it out and look at it. Even though it is agony at the time. Because if you don't, it will assume ridiculous proportions. And that's a bit of no good to anybody. You're talking like a psychoanalyst. - Never mind what I am talking like. You tell me about the Bay of Naples. Come on, don't be a coward. Well. It was that first morning when I got back from England. As I started to talk to him I went over to the window. I had never seen the bay look so beautiful. Shimmering blue. And lazy smoke in the distance. The little dancing boats with coloured sails. Heaven on earth. Before I could .. I could ask him what I had come to ask him. Or he could answer me. I turned around and .. I saw him. Later, after the doctor had been there. I looked out again. Everything was just the same. Only the little boats had moved farther on. And Oliver was dead. Is it ..? Are you getting any better? Missing him, you mean? - Yes. I was. Or I thought I was. Now it is worse than ever. Why? Because I am a complete and utter idiot. And he was the only person in the world who would understand. How about me? I am a pretty good understander. You are a darling. What's especially the matter today, Linda? You've been in a sort-of trance ever since morning. Come on. Don't be afraid. Tubbs, it is awfully stuffy in here. Yes. It's full of the things you won't say. Come on. Let's go outside. - Will you answer me three questions? What is this, a game? Why did you go to Leicester this morning .. Instead of coming for a nice walk in the fields? Alright. I'll try again. Where did you go after you left me? What did you do with yourself all morning? I went into a bar and had three beers. Then I came outside and sat in the car and wished I'd had only two. Why didn't you go for a nice walk? I'm the one that is asking the questions. Why did you act so strangely when you came back from town, huh? You are in the wrong profession, my lad. You were cut out for a Crown Prosecutor. I am on your side. Tubbs, I am terribly sorry. You will have to go away. - Why? Because I feel rather odd. I think I have to lie down for a bit. I'll ring up the castle. About this time the Rothman's doctor should be there. No. No, I don't want to see him. I believe he's a very good doctor. Of course, if you'd rather have another? I don't want to see any doctor. You can't go on like this. We've got to find out what is the matter with you. I know what is the matter with me. Don't you? Yes. I think I do. Do you think you are still in love with him? I think so. I .. I am so mixed up. My sweet, you will have to be very brave. Because I am sure really loves Rosamond. I believe I knew that. Then you mustn't feel bitter about Rosamond. It is so ironic. What? How she would envy you. She'd give anything in the world to have a baby and she never will. I never heard the Revered in better form. Come in, Alison. We'll have some tea. Hello. How do you do. Miss Dodd. May I introduce Mr Barrow. The famous writer? Yes. How marvellous of you to know it. - I didn't. Esther has told me all about you. Not all, I hope. - Well .. Belinda. You promised to get these books out of the way today. And here, you haven't even unpacked these cases. Let alone the two in the hall. I am sorry, aunt Esther. We got to talking and .. I advised her to let them be disposed of in Sorrento. But she insisted of having them sent here. At considerable expense to me. They are very valuable books, Miss Warren. I doubt it. My poor brother was exceedingly gullible. I don't want to talk ill of the dead. But I must say, I wish he had saved the money he spent on them. And left it to Linda instead. If I may .. - Tubbs, don't. Come, Alice. As I can't find room in my own downstairs. We will have tea in my bedroom. It is so nice to have met you. So refreshing to have met you. A charming person, isn't she. Makes me yearn for the gallows. I know. Still, I suppose it is rather trying to be .. Landed with an uncongenial penniless niece. How she and your father came from the same stock I cannot understand. It destroys my faith in heredity. Oh, well. I've got an idea. About me or the books? You. And I wouldn't be surprised if it turned out to be brilliant. What is it? - Well now .. I can't tell you yet. Too vague. Well, it had better be brilliant or I won't be able to .. - Shush. Shush. I am thinking. Now Tubbs, what are you up to? Napoleon Bonaparte Tubbs. Has decided on a plan of campaign. You idiot. I think it's really wonderful of Lady Farrington. And sending the car to fetch us and everything. And to think it was that nice Mr Barrow who arranged it. If you and he are such great friends .. Why didn't he have you invited too? I have no idea. He probably had his reasons. Well, be sure to put out the lights when you go out. I will, aunt Esther. Goodnight. - Goodnight. [ Whistle ] Tubbs! What are you doing here? - I was over there disguised as a tree. Belinda, you are going to have to come to a decision rather rapidly. It is all going to seem impossible and fantastic to you at first. But I want you to be unusually wise and recognise it as a brilliant solution. See? Now, I can't keep him waiting any longer. Who? - I forgot about this. Can you tell me what this is all about? Put it in a decanter. Bring it in with 2 glasses. What is it? - Port. And keep it for a while because it is probably upset by being swished about. Tubbs! [ Door knocks ] Linda, I want you to meet Lord Farrington. This is a very dear friend of mine, Belinda Warren. How do you do, Lord Farrington. It's nice of you to allow to me to pay you such an extremely .. Shall we say, informal, visit. Not at all. It's nice of you to .. Now, I'm going to rush out in the night. - Tubbs, you're not going to leave us? What time shall I return for you? - I leave that entirely to you, Edward. You have an excellent sense of turning up the right moment. Thank you, Edward. Goodnight Linda, and remember what I told you. Won't you come in please? Thank you. You know, I never realized before that Tubbs real name is Edward. He tells me I am the only person who ever uses it. Although it happens to be my own name, I like it. Would you sit down? - Thank you. I .. I expect you find life in an English village rather dull. After living so much abroad. You were in Italy last year, weren't you? Yes. Sorrento. Lord Farrington. May I offer you a glass of .. What I am quite sure is your own port. Hmm? What? Our mutual friend brought it in a medicine bottle. I suppose to lubricate this interview. I hope it isn't mean of me to tell on him. Not in the least. I am vastly entertained. At the idea of Edward purloining my own port. For my unsuspecting enjoyment. If indeed it is my port. Yes. That is the '78. Taste it. It is wonderful wine. Thank you. It is good, isn't it. It's sort-of warm and kindly. - Yes. Do you know. I can't help feeling vastly amused .. At the idea of my trying to pass this off as belonging to my aunt. Yes. I understand from Edward that you know my son. Yes. I wish he had introduced us earlier. That is very kind. I should like you to have met Rosamond, his wife. But I am afraid that is too late now. She is a very rare person. I think you would have been friends. I am sorry she is so ill. Do you really mean that? - Of course. I shall ask you to prove that to me. Lord Farrington. May I ask the reason for your coming here? Yes. Miss Warren. I want you to go away from here. Preferably to London until the spring. Early in May I should like you to sail for America. I understand you lived there with your father at one time. Yes. He taught at Harvard. With your qualifications and a little influence. You would soon find suitable employment. No. No, it isn't possible. Why, I couldn't even get there. From the moment you leave this house. Until you are securely established you become my responsibility. Lord Farrington. If I am being bought off .. I don't think you understand. I don't think you quite realize .. - I am sure I do, my dear. And you are not being bought off. Although I suppose in a way you are. Because you have it in your power .. To give me something I want more than anything in the world. What? My grandchild. Oh no. No, I couldn't. I won't. You haven't any right. My dear. You don't stand on firm enough moral ground .. To be able to say "I will do this or I will not do that". You have committed a wrong. A terrible wrong. And for that you are to be blamed. If you're here to talk of blame .. - And my son is to be blamed too. Equally with you. You are neither of you children to be lightly forgiven. I am not asking forgiveness. There are certain moral codes. That hold our civilisation together. Decencies that must be preserved. If marriage and family and all the rest of our civilised ideals .. Are not to come tumbling about our ears. Codes, decencies, ideals! A pack of words. Superior, intolerant words. What do they have to do with anything that's real? With feelings? No. No. You are right, Lord Farrington. I know that you are a fine man. If you say these things are true. Then they must be. Oliver would have said the same. Oliver? My father. My dear. I know that broken rules carry their own penalty. You will suffer yours in your heart all the days of your life. Do you think I would suffer any less if I gave up? No. No, you can't ask me to do it. No-one need ever know. You've planned this perfectly, haven't you? How about Bob's wife? She already knows. I've seen to it that he told her. Whether she ever forgives him .. I cannot say. Nor does it matter. Does she know about me? That is .. Who I am. - Not yet. Would it distress you if she did? Oh, yes. Somehow, I don't think I could bear that. Very well then, We will make that part of our agreement. We have made no agreement. Now, Lord Farrington. Would you please go. Why do you suddenly ask me to go? - Because I am so tired. Or is it because you are afraid you may come to see my point of view? Your point of view is easy to see. What about mine? What exactly is it? I didn't know until now. I suppose I have been too frightened and worried. To really think clearly. But just now when you asked me to give up my child. This suddenly stopped being just mess I've got to get myself out of. It is a life that I am responsible for. And I am sure you don't realize the weight of that responsibility. People can be cruel. Your position would not be an enviable one. I am not afraid. Perhaps not for yourself. But what about the child? I am offering it a home and a name. The succession to a title. And the fortune that rightfully belongs to Bob's child. A family tradition of character and honour. A father and a mother. What are you offering? I am offering it .. What? Why? Where would you live? Not in this house. Not in this village. You have no money. Where would you go? With the best intentions in the world, what can you give your child but misery? Don't fight me in this. Or you will reproach yourself all your life. I don't know. I .. I can't tell. Go away as I've suggested and start a new life. Forget this episode altogether. And give me your solemn word of honour. Never to mention this business to a living soul. You say all this as though it were easy. - Oh no. It will not be easy. If. If I were to agree. Are you sure that she would be kind? Absolutely, certain. I .. I cannot decide now. I am so tired. Perhaps in the morning. - Of course. I do hope your answer will be the right one. So do I. Goodbye, my dear. I hope you will see your way to doing what I ask. But whatever happens. I should like to think that you remember me as I shall always remember you. With kindness. Thank you, my dear. Thank you, sir. Goodnight, madam. - Goodnight. Well, here you are, Mrs Green. - Yes. Here I am. You must be very tired. I'll go on and leave you alone. No, don't go. - No? London terrifies me. I feel so strange and .. Just a little lonely. Nonsense. You mustn't be lonely. Look. I'll call on you from time to time. In a beard. So people will think I am Mr Green. Huh? Won't they think it a little odd that you are not living here? I shall be an explorer. Then you won't be able to call very often, will you? Yes. Because I shall be doing a small job of exploring quite near home. So I can drop in to see the little woman from time to time whenever I want to. Tubbs. - What? Tubbs, have I made the right decision? Certainly. It is the only rational, intelligent thing you could do. Now, chin up darling and all that sort of nonsense. I'm frightened. Of nothing. Here is an amusing idea. Suppose after all, everything is settled and it should turn out to be a girl? That would be pretty dreadful wouldn't it? From now on you must think of nothing but little boys. I am to have had my picture taken in rompers with a scooter. And you must sleep with it under your pillow. Come on. Not even a smile? It is not funny, Tubbs. It is ghastly serious. Oh, come darling. Come. Here we are. It's very nice of you Lord Farrington to come all this way to see me off. I couldn't let you leave without expressing my gratitude to you. I hope you will be happy. I am sure you have done the right thing. I hope so. Goodbye, darling. I am awfully proud of you, Linda. I am beginning to think that you are a very evolved young lady. Take care of yourself. - I will. You take care of .. Goodbye. Well. I could do with a drink myself. How about you? Yes, yes. You dropped this. Thank you. Were you leaving so much behind? Enough. Too bad. You know, it is different with me. I am going home. New York. Not much of a place to visit but it's certainly a great little place to live. My name is Jim Baker in case you are interested. Well. Even if you are not interested it is still Jim Baker. There's a thing about leaving things behind. You never know what comes up ahead to meet you. That is why I like getting on ships. You know, ships are friendly. People meet. I .. I've heard of friendships made on ship that lasted a lifetime. Of course now, mind. Usually they don't. It's usually just a couple of dizzy whirls around the moonlit deck and .. Fare thee well. But. That is only if people want it to be that way. If they don't .. Well, even if one of them doesn't. And he is a particularly stubborn fellow. Why, you can never tell what might happen. Don't you think so? What? I am sorry. I'm afraid I wasn't listening. Well, then I'll begin again. I was saying that my name is Jim Baker. That's if you're interested. Even if you are not interested it's still Jim Baker. I was saying that .. Ships are very friendly things. No, Jenkins. Not so high. Nothing but the lower shelves for these. The lower shelves, Your Lordship? Yes. Here, I think. But The History of England. It has been here since .. Remove The History of England. Remove The History of England? Yes. I said remove The History of England. And .. and Shakespeare too? I don't think he is likely to be offended. Very good, Milord. You see, all these volumes. Will one day belong to my grandson. I am sure the friend who sent them to me, had that in mind. It will be some time before the young master will be reading extensively. It will be not long before he comes stumbling about in here exploring. I want these to be where he can reach them. Let him make castles with them if he wants to. I want him to grow up with them as friends. Books can be the truest friends of all, Jenkins. If you only get to know them young enough. Yes. I have heard that said, Milord. But my taste in friends runs to those .. Who you can lift a glass of ale with. Well go to it, Jenkins. - Yes, Milord. - Hurry up. It's kind of you to trouble to come here to accept my thanks, Miss Warren. No trouble, Lord Farrington. - On the contrary. I would have come down to you. But my physician is getting to be such a decrepit old wreck. That he constantly frets over the state of my health. This is really a remarkable collection of very fine books. I hope you will help me to convey to Linda how touched I am with her gift. May I pour you a cup of tea? - Thank you. The books belonged to my dear brother. I was dumbfounded when her letter came with instructions to give them to you. Probably, Linda had her reasons. I mean, I didn't know you were so well acquainted. What our acquaintance lacked in age it made up for in understanding. I wonder what can be keeping Edward with that boy. [ Banging noises ] That would be Edward now. You are in for a spanking, old boy. But let's take it like little men, eh? Giddy-up for me. Go on. Edward. Come along, my boy. Look at that beautiful child. You precious little darling. Come to me, darling. Won't you? Come to me. He is not allowed to do that. I am bringing him up to be a woman-hater. Well. How do you like him? He is adorable. No-one could mistake whose family he came from. Isn't that right, Alice? It certainly is. He is the very image of his father. Not at all. He looks exactly like his mother. Anyone could see that. - Yes. I suppose almost anyone could. How is dear Mrs Melford? Very remarkably improved. Now, you run along old son. And find yourself some mischief. Having a child was just what she needed I am sure. Yes, yes. Indeed. Have you heard from Linda lately? If one letter in two years can be called .. Hearing from a person. Well, how is she? What does she say? As little as possible in as few words as possible. It was plain her only purpose in writing .. Was to instruct me to turn over Oliver's books to Lord Farrington. But don't forget the cheque, dear. Oh yes. She did enclose a cheque. For, as she phrased it, my kindness to her. As if money could repay care and affection. Didn't she say anything about herself? Well she mentioned quite casually indeed that she'd been married for some months. Oh .. I am so happy for her. To some American, named James Baker. A very wealthy American. But as for inviting her dear father's only sister to visit her. Or even asking that I write to her. Oh no. Not our little Linda. You mustn't condemn her so readily. You don't know what may have been in her heart and thoughts. Lord Farrington. I was not born yesterday. And I flatter myself I know a thing or two about human nature. It is perfectly obvious to me. That Linda has become very uppish. Just because she has been lucky enough to marry well enough. To have everything to make her happy. Everything? - Yes. Everything. Well, you are her aunt. You ought to know. Have some more tea? No thank you. He was at the Sterns last week. I'll admit he is beautiful. Even off the screen. Katie was in a panic over him all weekend. Announcing to anyone who would listen, that here was a man at last .. That she would give up home and family and even a good name for. I told her that she reminded me of congress. Always trying to spend something that she hadn't got anymore. Darling, the latest bulletin from the front. Our host just swallowed his 900th yawn. No, it is early. - It's after three. Already? Suppose we refuse to leave. Then what? There is always the Persian Room. How about it, Bill? No. My husband is a working man. - Bill, what time is the ride tomorrow? Harry, I forgot. I promised Mildred to help her buy a coat. If I don't go with her she'll end up looking like an alley-cat with mange. See you at Harvey's for cocktails? I'll try to make it but I promised the Masons also. The opening anyway. - Rather. Goodnight. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Oh Bill and Jim, you are not leaving? I am afraid so, Ethel. It was lovely. Thank you Bill. I was a nice having you. Goodnight, Mrs Hayle. Thanks for a lovely evening. Come on, Bill. You're not going? When you leave the party it is all over. According to my husband, when I leave the party it has been over for hours. Goodnight. - Goodnight, dear. Boo. You looked beautiful this morning, Bill. Oh Jim, I've done it again, haven't I. After all my good resolutions. I am sorry, darling. Bill. What are you after? What do you mean? - All this mad scramble. This merry-go-round. I like to keep busy if that is what you mean. It won't do. You know Bill, if the greyhounds at a racetrack ever caught the rabbit. They wouldn't find him quite as juicy as they think. Or would they? It would all be a lot clearer my darling if you didn't talk in parables. Well, it isn't clear because .. Well, because it is all complicated. I mean. Well, you've been pretty happy since we were married, haven't you Bill? Of course .. you know I have. Well, there are times when I know darned well that you are miserable. Well, darling. Happiness isn't a chronic state. Even the best of us gets depressed at times. Yes. But there is usually a reason for it. Robert. For heaven's sakes be careful. He missed it by a mile. If I must die I don't want to be in a smash-up. You see, Bill. You're living on your nerves. You can't last much longer that way. I'd last a lot longer if you gave me a chauffeur who could drive. Oh darling, I am sorry. Don't let me get started again. Nothing. What you need is sleep. Weeks of it. Yes, I know that. - You never sleep very well. How do you know? I sometimes hear you in the night. Do I make that much noise? You did last night. You must have had a nightmare or something. You yelled out and .. And started jabbering to yourself. - What did I say? I don't know. Just mumbled. [ Buzzer ] I am sorry. I must have fallen asleep. My fault. I forgot my key again. Bring me a pitcher of hot milk, will you grace. Where is Johnson? Johnson rushed to the hospital. They're expecting a baby. Really? Well, isn't that something. I hope his wife is alright. We'll have to order a new uniform for Johnson now. His chest will pop the buttons off the old ones. Some people have all the luck, don't they. Meaning which? Don't you know? Jim. Jim. Yes. Do you wish you hadn't married me? What do you think? Quite honestly, I don't know. Do you suppose I am the kind of man who would chase a girl the way I chased you? And keep after her to marry her the way I did you .. And then turn around and wish I hadn't done it? I wouldn't blame you. I loved you and I wanted you and I made up my mind to get you. And you did. No. What? I love you more than ever. And we are married. But I haven't got you. You know it, Bill. Sometimes you wander off in your thoughts to .. heaven knows where. You won't even let me help you back. And I sometimes think you almost hate me when I try. Jim, don't. Sometimes we're not even on the same star. I can't get within a million miles of you. Darling, I .. I hate to think that I have made you so unhappy. It's only once in a while. I never mean to be unkind to you. You are not, darling. You have been wonderful to me. I guess that is why I can't stand it when .. Oh .. when you walk out on me. [ Door knocks ] That's Grace. Let her in, will you. Don't you let it happen again, young lady. Or else take me with you. Thanks, Grace. I'll tend to it. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Here we are. Jim .. try to put up with me. Just remember how much I love you and .. I need a good tonic or something. I must be run down. - Here. I hope this puts me to sleep. You need more than this, Bill. What you need is a sea voyage. I can't leave you. - You won't have to. It looks as if I'll have to make a trip. - Really? How is that? Perfect. Where to? - England. England. - Uhuh. It is business but I won't be tied up all the time. I thought we could get a car and you could show me around a bit. If it didn't bore you too much. No. No, of course it wouldn't. Only .. Only what? It will be rather rough this time of year, won't it? You know, I'm not a very good sailor. Well, I can take care of you. I took care of you once. Yes. It is terribly sweet of you to think of taking me. Oh .. but you don't care about going? It isn't that, darling. You see, I .. Alright then. I get you. You just don't want to go. Darling. You don't understand. I'd adore to go with you. More than anything else in the whole world. I just wish you weren't going to England. That's all. I'm sorry, but that is where I have to go. You say I don't understand. Then why don't you make me understand? I can't. You said you didn't care. That you didn't want to know. I don't. But I thought perhaps it might make you feel better. There is nothing really to tell anyway. If you can't think a good reason for not going then you are darned well going. Jim. - I mean it. Maybe a sea breeze can knock the nonsense out of your head. It's not nonsense. No? All the moods you've been having lately? Everybody has moods. Yes, darling, but not like yours. Now, you've got to snap out of it. A trip is the thing. - Jim, don't go on and on. You give me a good reason .. - Can you give me a good reason? Yes I can. Listen, Bill. I don't give a rats for this mysterious past of yours. But I do care a heck of a lot about our future. And as far as I can see it is heading straight for the rocks. Now, don't you think you should change your mind? Of course. I am terribly sorry. I was so stupid. I will go anywhere you like. It doesn't matter to me a bit. I can see that. You might have said goodbye. Before you walked out on me again. Oh. I beg your pardon, madam. I am sorry. You take it, won't you. Please. Yes, you have it. - Thank you. Floors please. - Sixteen. Floor please, sir? Six. Teen. 16th floor, sir. 16C ..? Hello, Johnson. Mrs Baker expects me. - Yes, Miss. Mister Baker expects me. Yes indeed, sir. Will you both wait here, please. My dear, we seem destined to meet. Apparently. - Yes. But who are we to argue against fate? - Such a pregnant question. Who are we? Me, I am Florence Cudahy. - My name is Barrow. I know you. - You do? You are a G-man, You follow people. - Yes, but .. Only as a recreation you know. I write. As little as possible. By profession I am a taxpayer. - Well, aren't we all? Yes. Only unfortunately though I never seem to pay quite the right amount. That's why I am here you see. To make use of Mr Baker's fine legal mind. Just one of the great army of those who have to be helped with their income tax. I am afraid so, yes. What are you? Well, I hate to tell you. - Oh no. My dear young man, is that the kind of a mind you have? Definitely, yes. Then you will be disappointed to know that I am only a doctor. You, a doctor? Want a feel? No. And don't start telling me your symptoms. As a matter of fact, now I am in New York .. I've had an odd sensation in my elbow. - Oh, a coffee drinker? You guessed it. This gentleman to see you and Dr Cudahy for madam. Alright. Who is the man? - A friend of Wolf's. An Englishman in a jam with the income tax people. Couldn't he see you at the office? It's a Sunday. Well, he made such a point of coming here today, I .. I couldn't very well get out of seeing him. I'll be right back. Tell Florence I will be right down. What is the matter with her? - Who? Lynn .. the person you call "Bill". Nothing. She is swell. Yes? Then why are you here? You need to be one of the medical ethics committee .. For me to discuss the health of my patient with a stranger. Come now, none of us are perfect. You are entirely too smart. Hello, Jim. Hello, Florence. Bill will be right down. Sorry to keep you waiting. Perfectly alright. Actually, I had a delightful time. Do you two know each other? - Now we do. Intimately. Bill. - Yes? Want me to come up? - No. I'm coming along. Can we get down to business, Mr Barrow? - Very good of you to trouble to see me. No thanks. We'll go in the library. You will pardon me, Bones? With pleasure, you tax evader. Forgive me for keeping you waiting. I'm not sure that I will. - I don't do it very often, do I. No-one does it very often. Not even you. How have you been? - Not too good. You are smoking too much, Bill. Come over here and relax. Yes. If I can. You can alright. Now let's see. Ah, you are all tightened up back here. Keep right on doing that. It is lovely. - Nerves. I can't sleep. That's too bad. - It's driving me crazy. You trying that hot milk I suggested? - I've tried everything, Florence. Hot milk. Counting sheep. Jim won't let me take tablets. Good for Jim. What you need is more exercise. Twice around the reservoir every day. I'd have to have a dog for that. A husband is a good substitute. I'll send someone round to give you a good rub each night. That'll fix you up. No. No, it isn't quite as simple as all that. Come on, Bill. Tell me. What is wrong? I am worried about Jim. Jim? Why? I haven't been very nice to him lately. That's up to you, isn't it? It's ghastly to know that you are being rotten to someone that you love. This morning. Every morning. I am absolutely foul to him. Simply because he's so cheerful and healthy and I'm just ahead of insanity. I don't know what to do, Florence. I feel as though I were knee deep in quicksand. Well. It is a little out of my province, Bill. Why not see a good psychoanalyst? No. He'll dig it out for you. - No. Nothing would induce me to do that. It is only an idea. - Well, it is a bad idea. Now, we simply add schedules A,B,C,D and E. And subtract schedule F, the deduction of a claim with items 1, 13, 17, and 18. Also, the deduction under the schedule A and B. Do you follow me? - No. No, I lost you early in the alphabet. Where you took F from C, D and E. Why didn't the supreme court do a thing about that when they abolished the NRA? I am sure a lot of people would be grateful. Cigarette? - No thanks. No. Oh. That reminds me. I think I left my own cigarette case in the other room. So I've got to get it now or I will leave it behind. I'll catch up with you when I return. Bill, I'm ready to give you a tonic. Excuse me, I think I left my cigarette case. Ah, here it is. Tubbs. Linda! Tubbs, it can't be. Tubbs, darling. Yes, it must be Tubbs. How did you get in here? - He followed me. But how ..? I know. You are the income tax man. Imagine find him for the income tax. Bones, would you mind going away somewhere for about five minutes? Where to? No, don't tell me. You might help Mr Baker doctor my tax report. Alright, five minutes. But remember I haven't got all day. Come right over here, darling. Sit down and tell me all about yourself. You tell me about yourself. Why didn't you write? Too much to tell. - Or no inclination to tell it? Edward and I worried about you. You are a heartless little brat to drop people out of your life like that. Not even answering my letters. You can tell Edward I am quite, quite happy. Tell Edward? Didn't you know? He isn't ..? Last winter. Heart. Oh. I am dreadfully sorry. Edward thought a great deal about you. Particularly after you sent the books. So, finally I made up my mind to come over here and track you down by myself. Whether you liked it or not. I went into all sorts of fantastic plottings. Getting introduced to your husband by a friend. Asking his advice about my income tax. I could apply for a job as a detective. I read in The Times the other day. That Lord and Lady Farrington are in town. Yes. If Lord Farrington is here .. With Bob and Rosamond. They are over here to look after Bob's American interests. Which haven't been so interesting lately. They are sailing back with me late tomorrow night. We've had a marvellous time. Rosamond is much stronger and .. - Do you mind not speaking of her here. Do you mind. Why? Nobody here knows, do they? Of course not. I'd just rather you didn't. That's all. There must be one or two things you'd like to know about. One in particular. No, thanks. There is nothing. Tell me more about you. Why are you really here? Seeing publishers and what is known as "negotiating" about a play. That sounds beautifully successful. Why not ask me what you really want to know? There isn't anything I want to know. Did you sell your play? You are not really interested in my play. You are just avoiding issues. You are dying to ask me about him. Why don't you? Tubbs, please. Why don't you? - For heaven's sake. Why don't you? I daren't. Ah, that is more like it. Why don't you dare? Because I have got a new life here with someone I love. I want to make him happy. I never can do that if thoughts keep creeping in about .. How are you going to stop them? Just by shutting them out of my mind. That's all. That is what I am trying to do. That is what I have got to do. It doesn't seem like an awfully good idea to me. Well it is the only way. I know that. Well, it might work. But if you're not interested in little Edward .. Not interested? What do you think it is like to feel there is .. A part of you that you know nothing about? Don't you think I long to see him? To hear all about him. How tall he is. What he likes to eat. Whether he looks like me. He does a little. The eyes, I think. - No, no. Don't. Well, there you are. Playing that ostrich game. It is no good burying bogeys. They just creep up out of their graves again. Why don't you talk to me, huh? Have a good cry. It will make you feel better. Tubbs, I don't think you realize. Suppose it didn't make me feel better? Suppose I went all to pieces? And that is what I am afraid of. Don't you see? I might give the whole thing away. Oh, darling. Thanks for bothering about me. - Don't mention it. You had better go and fix your face. It is all over my coat. Alright. Linda. - Yes? Do you remember the Bay of Naples? That was entirely different, Tubbs. Mr Barrow. - Bones, don't do that. Will you tell me something. - Yes, but don't do that again. I just heard you call her Linda. - Uhuh. That doesn't Bill object to that? - Why should she? Well, I did it once and the explosion just about blew the roof off. I never discuss my patients with strangers. Even perfect ones. Look. Clean me up a little bit, will you. I've got a dozen patients waiting already. Yes. Well you can stay away from them and give them a chance to recover. Thank you. Thank you. Well, all I need now is your signature. Dear fellow, you mean I let you do all the figuring alone? I managed. What about a drink? - Just enough to oil up my elbow. Yes. And Florence? - No thanks. Did you find your cigarette case? - Yes I did, thanks. I found an old friend at the same time. Who, Florence? - No. Your wife. Really? Yes. I knew her before her father died. Really? - Yes. Two whiskey sodas. - Yes, sir. Good for Bill to meet an English friend. The first one since we've been married. Oh yes? - Yes. Linda has always been very sensitive about places where she has been unhappy. She ought to make that trip to England with you. It's the one place she should go. She should see people from there too. She mustn't keep everything to fester in her mind. I wish I knew what to do to help her get over it. It makes me feel like an awful flop .. To know she has something on her mind and I can't fix it for her. I wonder if you and Mrs Baker would join me for dinner tomorrow night. I should imagine we'd be delighted. - Bones can come too. I am game if the evening dress still holds together. Bones in an evening dress, huh? - A quaint notion, isn't it. No. Now that I look at you I think it might be very intriguing. Don't be nice to me. I cannot bear it. Well, Jim. Are you going to be able to keep my friend out of jail? Just by the skin of his teeth I think. - Isn't it a shame. He's asked us to have dinner with him tomorrow evening. - Splendid. I'm coming too. I thought we might meet in the Curzon bar about 8:30. If that is agreeable to you. - It would be a bar. It is sweet of you, Tubbs. Not at all. I think you are going to enjoy it. Come, Bones. Here's your aspirin tablet. We've must get on to our next patient. I am sure he said 8:30. - Tubbs is always late. Would you like a cocktail while we wait? - No thanks. Not now. Waiter. One dry Martini, please. - Yes, sir. See him? - No. I was just looking at nothing. Thinking, I guess. - Yes. Must have been big thoughts. I do wish he would hurry. Why did he ask us to meet him here? Have you seen a ghost? No. I haven't. I thought I saw someone. - Oh? Someone we know? No. That is, I thought it was but I was mistaken. Shall we wait outside? - Outside? Why? The smoke and noise. It's hot. Waiter. Your order, madam. - Will you open a window. My husband is English. He's uncomfortable in this. He is sitting in a draft. Don't do it, man. She is pulling your leg. Yes, sir. Tell me, what made you come by for me? - Pure chivalry. I thought that was dead. - Not in my family it isn't. It comes down from father to son. And I happened to be at a cocktail party practically next door to where you live. So it seemed the obvious thing to do. And how did you find out where I lived? - Ah, the telephone book. Ah, you read. - Right. You know, there is some nasty motive lurking behind all this. Bones, have you never heard of love? - Yes. I've heard of Santa Claus too. Neither of them every came down my chimney. This is love. - Oh, you thrill me. Besides, I might need the protection of your strong arm later in the evening. I knew there was something. What are you up to? Don't give me that dark, suspicious look. I am only giving a party. You'll be grateful to me for introducing you to nobility. Nobility? The other guests. Lord and Lady Farrington. Does Bill know them? She lived practically next door to them in England. What are you are plotting against Bill? You know, you're arousing my great mother heart. Well, of course I am only an amateur compared to you. But I have the great advantage of knowing what is the matter with her. Ah. In that case I guess I will just have to have confidence in you. It's what this world needs. Girls like you to have more confidence in men like me. Well, here we go. Hello Florence. - Hello Mr Barrow. Here already? - Been waiting for you. I am awfully sorry. I hope .. Glad to see you. - How do you do. Linda, you look lovely tonight. Thank you, dear. - Lovely. Where are the others? What others? Didn't I tell you? Sorry. Careless of me not to mention it. I invited some friends to join us. You don't mind? Of course not. That's fine. - How many friends? Just .. two. They are very nice people from home. Lord and Lady Farrington. He is in Parliament. Well, we will be delighted to meet them, won't we Bill. Oh. There they are over there. I will go and bring them over. Take me home, Jim. What? I said, take me home. - Why? Because I asked. Isn't that enough? But you can't do that. You can't break up a party for no reason. Without any reason? That is funny. Well, what is your reason? Alright then. Certainly. We'll stay. We'll stay and we'll all have a very, very pleasant evening. I thought we were dining alone with you, old man. Practically alone. Only 2 or 3 other people. Darling, what difference does it make? They are probably delightful people. What's the matter? - Nothing, but can't a man be surprised? Of course a man can be surprised. Certainly he can. The family physician, Dr Cudahy. Lady Farrington. How do you do. Mrs Baker - Lady Farrington. How do you do. - Delighted. I hope you two are going to be great friends. Here's the man who kept me out of jail. All England owes you gratitude. Yours will be enough. Lord Farrington - Mrs Baker. I think we met a long time ago. Oh, yes. How are you? Very well, thank you. Mr Baker - Lord Farrington. How do you do. - How do you do. Bob - this is Bones. How do you do. You must be utterly exhausted after all that introducing. Jim, I think I'll have a cocktail now. - Yes. A corking idea. Let's all go to the bar and have one there. Hold my hand. I have a hunch I ought to ring your neck. Do one or the other but do something. Here we are. - Thanks. Belinda, what will you have? A Martini. - A Martini, yes. Bones? I never drink. You'd better have something now. It's good for what ails you. Just this once then. Martini. Purely medicinal. - Indeed, yes. But I hope I get a slight kick out of it as well. Rosamond? - Dry sherry please. Bob, what will you have? - A Scotch and soda. Jim? - Same with plain water. I'll have an old fashioned. You know, the kind with whiskey is it. Can you make me a double just like that? - I think I can, madam. You know, as yet nobody has mentioned the very nicest thing about New York. Everyone has been so kind. Kind? Here? Yes. People have made us feel so welcome. I mean as though they were really glad to see us. I can't imagine anyone not being pleased to see you. Thank you, darling. Better take it easy, Bill. Why? You think I'll get drunk and shock the aristocracy? At least you might try to be polite. Then again I might not. Mrs Baker. Haven't I met you before somewhere? No. I don't think so. Funny. I thought I had. You wish to order dinner, sir? - I ordered it by telephone. Mr Barrow. Yes, sir. Very well, sir. Perhaps you remind me of someone. Perhaps. There is something about the brow. I wonder who it could be. It might be almost anybody, darling. All sorts of people have brows these days, you know. Go away, Tubbs. I am very curious about this "Tubbs" business. It isn't your real name is it? No. I acquired it at an early age. Something to do with my shape I believe. Well, it certainly hasn't now. - You are too kind. Why are all children so fat? - Edward isn't. What? He used to be. - He never was. Fat as a pig. You see from the angry tigress attitude, that Edward is heir to Lord Farrington. And very proud we are of him too. It might be national babies week. Did you bring him with you? Yes, indeed. He wouldn't hear of our coming without him. Well, go on. Out with the vanity. - I wouldn't if I were you, darling. Why not? Nobody's interested in photos of other people's babies. Edward is nothing to be ashamed of. - I'd like to see it if I may. Well, you see inside on the mirror there is a picture. And whenever I feel particularly depressed I just open it and .. And there is Edward looking out at me. What lovely eyes. - And it looks exactly like him. I'd like to show it to Bill if I may. - Do. I'll bring it right back. - Alright. Are you sure you want to bothered with it, Mrs Baker? Yes. Thank you. Isn't that the cutest kid? Look at the way he is resting on his elbows. He is charming. He's the loveliest child I've ever seen. - Most people think so too. I am sure they do. Let me see it again, will you. It is a beautiful child. Billy. Lady Farrington. Don't you think we have the most beautiful bars here in America? Yes. Quite. That is what I often say we need in England. More attractive bars. Of course, we have nice ones too. See, Americans think over there it is a bar, a barmaid and a pitcher of ale. Silly, isn't it. Dinner is served, Mr Barrow. Not a moment too soon. I am starved. Jim, take in Lady Farrington, will you. - Pleasure. Bones, I fall to you. - Ever fall for anybody? Are you asking for the story of my life? - I wouldn't dare. It is an open book. - I don't read that kind of literature. Bob, will you take in Mrs Baker? Linda, I .. I am frightfully sorry. I mean I .. Will you take this to your wife please. Has it been wretched misery for you? What do you think? I don't suppose it will help you to know but .. It has for me. Let's go in to dinner, shall we. Care to dance, Bill? - Yes. Wonderful dancers, weren't they. - I didn't think you saw them. You were watching me all the time. - Was I? You looked like you'd just removed the cellophane to see what you actually got. You got me wrong. How much have you thought about my trip? I am sailing in a week on The Empress. They say she is a beautiful boat. - Uhuh. I don't suppose it's any use in selling you a trip. Is there? I don't think it is a very good moment. - Well, it is as good as any. Listen, Bill. As long as you won't come with me. I want you to do some serious thinking while I am gone. What about? - About you and me. You know, there is something terribly wrong with us. And you are the only one who knows what it is. I need you to make up your mind if it's a thing that can be put right because .. Well, because otherwise .. - For heaven's sake let's not talk here. We've got to. It has meant too much to me to sit by now and watch it rust away. I want to go back to the table, Jim. I know you will excuse me. Goodnight. It has been a pleasure. I'll call you in the morning, Florence. But Bill, where are you going? I will be back in a moment. Mrs Baker. Oh, you should represent America in the Olympics. I hope you forgive my strange behaviour. As a matter of fact, I suddenly felt quite ill. I could not let you go without a chat. I want to talk to you if you don't mind. I am not in a very talkative mood. - Please. It is very important. Let's sit down over there, shall we? Let the others wonder what has become of us. Alright. I wanted to tell you how tremendously glad I am to have met you. That's nice of you. It has been delightful. It has been more than that to me. Has it? - Yes. The end of conjecture. Rather a blessed release. I don't think I quite .. - Forgive me. My conviction is so clear and definite I felt we may dispense with preliminaries. You don't want to keep on pretending, do you? I still don't understand. - Perhaps I ought to ask you. So, from my point of view it isn't necessary. Still, it will give you a chance to shut me up if you want to. It .. It is you. Isn't it? Yes. You don't like me very well, do you? Like you? I hate you. Yes. Of course. Why shouldn't you? I've thought of you in your fine castle with your husband and your son. Your son? You didn't bear him. You didn't suffer to have him. Well, you couldn't even .. Why should I be talking to you like this? You probably hated me just as much as I have you. No. A little at first. And Bob more than you. I tried not to. I kept saying to myself, I am civilised woman. This cannot make any difference. But it did. You can make your mind say those things but never make yourself believe them. Something was gone. It was a long time before I could begin loving him again. Almost as long as it took me to know my .. son. But of course. You don't know Edward. You can't understand. My dear, you don't realize what you did for me. You gave me something I could never otherwise have had. The happiness I had never dared to hope for. I have felt so guilty. You have? Why? I have been tremendously happy. And all at your expense. It must have been dreadful for you. How did you know about it? About me, I mean. The likeness, I suppose. One or two other little things. Bob's embarrassment. The way you looked at the picture. Wouldn't you like to come upstairs and see Edward? No! No, I couldn't. - My dear. You must. He is big for his age, isn't he. Yes. He is going to be a tall man. What does he do? If he had his own way he'd spend most of his time riding in his pony cart. I hope he has a nice, quiet pony. You needn't worry. He is not afraid. Is he brave? Yes. I think he is about most things. He can't bear loud noises. I don't think he'll ever want to be a soldier. I am glad. Aren't you? He looks so sweet. Mr Barrow, what do you think about tall buildings and beautiful girls? I hadn't noticed the tall buildings. How about a spot of brandy? Bones? Thank you very much. But of course. Has he a rocking horse? Why, no. I don't know why. He has almost everything else. Oliver. My father. Used to always give me books. I suppose it was for the best but I always wanted a rocking horse. Would you like to send him one? May I? Well, I can't think if a nicer present for a third birthday. Can you? You are so kind. I do wish we could be friends. And see a lot each other, I mean. It is funny that our greatest bond makes that impossible. Isn't it? I .. I am terribly happy that .. That you are his mother. I do hope you will be happier. Happier than I deserve, probably. You have taken a great weight off my heart. Of courses, I .. I can never be quite .. But now I know. I will never have to worry about him again. It's such a pleasant evening. - Uhuh. I feel as if I've been sitting on top of a volcano. I hope you are satisfied. - With you as a dancer? Delighted. And as a doctor? - Oh, I don't know. A darned cheek, I call it. Interfering with my patient. - Your patient? I like that. All you do is look after her health. I performed what I hope was a successful major operation on her state of mind. Do you mind? - It's a relief, old boy. Thanks for nothing. What am I going to do, Florence? About Bill? - Yes. We had a sweet little row this evening. It gets me down but the trouble is .. - You are crazy about her. Yes. - No. The trouble is you are altogether too nice to her. Maybe that is my trouble. Take a tip from the family physician. You've tolerated this nonsense too long. What should I do, sock her on the jaw? - A swell idea. You mean, literally? - And figuratively. And if you will take advice from someone who knows nothing about anything. Tonight, after we've all said our goodnights, you will talk to her. And you will tell her what you think. Now, really. A nice evening. - Yes, very. I'm afraid we really must say goodnight. I still have some packing to do. Let us know if you come to New York again. I certainly will. Goodbye Rosamond. Goodbye, my dear. I will write to you. I wish you would. Goodbye. - Goodbye. I'll see you on the dock. - Righto. Let us know if you ever get abroad, won't you. Yes. We'll do that. Goodnight. - Goodbye. I wonder you had the nerve to look me in the face. Why? It's not such a bad face. Oh, darling. Thanks for saving my sanity. - The bogey gone? Turned into something lovely. Like the Bay of Naples? Bye, Tubbs. - Bye, darling. I hope you have a lovely trip. And I hope you're seasick all the way. Thanks for a very unusual evening. - Not at all. I'll see you in the next fiscal year, old chum. Can we give you a lift? No, we'll give you a lift. The car is near here. No. I want to walk. Let's go home by the park. I guess we will walk. - Good idea, Bill. Perhaps it will make you sleep tonight. - I'll sleep. She will. Taxi, please. Goodbye. - Goodnight. Come on. I've got things to say to you. Haven't you talked enough? - Uhuh. I wish we didn't have to go home just as we've begun to meet such nice people. What did you and Mrs Baker find to talk about so long? Oh, nothing very much. Just getting to know each other. Where did you meet her before? - In England. Well, you know, dear. People do meet in England. I forgot to tell you something tonight. What? I love you very dearly. Thank you very much. Fancy you having friends like that. I am quite a fellow when you get to know me. You'll make a great mistake if you let me get on that boat alone tonight. I'll spend a miserable life if I don't. Imagine listening to your prattle until I die. A girl like you ought to jump at the chance of a man like me. Now, you had better think it over. I'll spend the night in meditation. What a way to spend a night. While you're meditating I will be passing out of your life. Well I'll be passing out anyway. Then you will need a doctor. How soon can you pack? I am already packed. Driver, hurry! We've got a lot of things to do and we are catching a boat. Well? Smile. I was certainly ashamed of you tonight. - Were you? The way you acted. 0h, Jim. What do you suppose the Farringtons thought? Lots of things. - I'll bet they did. I am sorry. Well, that is the last straw. I'm through. It's finished, over with. Yes, thank heaven. What did you say? The trouble. Nonsense. All my bad behaviour. It has ended. I am never going to walk out on you again. Do you expect me to believe that? - It's true. We'll see about that. But I will tell you one thing. I'm going down to the steamship company tomorrow morning to buy another ticket. I hope they haven't sold out since this afternoon. It will be awfully lonely following you on another boat. Yes .. eh, what? It really would be. And furthermore. Wherever I go from now on you are going with me. Alright, dear. Unless I am too busy bringing up the children. Yes. I think I'm going crazy. Darling, don't do that. Not just when I've gotten sane again. You know. That Florence Cudahy is a brainy woman. What makes you say that? - Well, never mind. Tell me. It is something she told me. Some advice she gave me. About us? - Yes. I begin to understand. And to think. That after all the fretting and worrying I have done about you and me. All it needed was for me to get a little tough. Yes, dearest. That is all that was needed. Hmm. [ Whistling ] -(-Ro-S-)-
