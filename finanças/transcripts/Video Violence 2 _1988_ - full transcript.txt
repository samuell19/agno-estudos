Oh boy! Evan, have a heart! Evan! Evan! for christsake, Evan! Evan, Evan, yeah! yeah boy [sniffs] and still, there is no relief in sight from the ninety degree heat wave and the unrelenting humidity it is doubtful that we will see a break much before next week on the local front this cable network as well as others across the country have been deluged with letters the past few weeks both in anger and in praise regarding the pirate broadcasts of something called the Howard and Eli show, for those of you unaware of this phenomenon, it appears that some electronics wiz has found a way to scramble the satelite signals of this and other cable stations across the country and the world for all we know, in order to substitute their own programming, and what a program it is Howard and Eli, two very strange individuals purport to be talk show hosts and they preview and review what are apparently homemade snuff videos. No one thus far can figure out where the show emanates from or whether or not the video shown are real or just the work of some very good special effects experts, but regardless the show is quite controversial, and also quite a hit. Local authorities are working diligently to find the base of operations and the FBI is investigating the reality of the aleged "splatter videos" the FCC wants it known that it does not take lightly to this sort of flagrant disregard of cable regulations meanwhile, it appears that there are as many viewers who are in love with the show as those who are horrified by it. and this announcer finds it particularly frightening that many viewers write to ask where they can send in their own, home grown video violence, the managers of this cable station want to make it very clear that the Howard and Eli Show is the work of outlaws and has nothing to do whatsoever what? Really? well ladies and gentleman, it appears that the boys are at it again, it seems we are losing some of our signal strength, apparently they are breaking in as I speak, so I guess if you have a strong stomach and you're curious, stay tuned to this channel for what apparently will be a broadcast of the Howard and Eli Show, if however you faint at the sight of blood I suggest you change the channel now this is channel 35 cable news network signing off for tonight. [music plays] warm up your chainsaws and sharpen your knives, it's time for those gurus of gore! Yes... it's the Howard and Eli Show! [audience shouting] Tonight's homemade splatter videos include another visit to the zany video studios, a home made electric chair, and the succulent segment on violent young college women. Plus a special treat when we bring on a live guest actress! So let's go to our very own madcap murderers, Howard and Eli! [applause] [music] Good evening ladies and gentlemen, welcome to WGOR, and the Howard and Eli Show. And now tonight's hosts, Eli! thank's Howard! How's everybody doing tonight? Great, great. You know a funny thing happened to me last week. I was out hunting with my buddy Lester, when out from behind a tree jumps this beautiful babe, buck-ass naked I went up to her and I says "are you game?" She goes "Sure" so Lester shot her! [laughter and applause] Now for you Howard, what's red and green and goes 120 miles per hour? What's red and green and goes 120 miles an hour? I don't know A frog in a blender! [laughter and applause] One more, one more. What's black and white and red all over and can't get through a revolving door? what's black and white and can't get through a revolver door? Do you know that one Gordo? I, I don't know. No what is it? A nun with a spear through her head! [laughter] I see Gordon liked that one, you know Gordon our musical maniac [applause] you sound hot tonight Gord! [laughter] you know a lot of people don't know this about Gordon, but he was once heavily involved in politics, he had to give it up because the opposition found too many skeletons in his closet, real ones! [laughter] one of them was his old girlfriend one day she goes "Oh Gordon, you kill me" so he did! [laughter] I tell you though, it was probably the best thing he ever did remember her she was such a nag, I remember I was over for dinner one time and she starts up "Gordon, Gordon I hate my brother's guts." Remember what you said to her? "Shut up and eat what I put in front of you." [laughter] and another time I was over and she started again "Gordon, Gordon, I'm tired of running around in circles" and Gordon goes "ah shut up before I nail your other foot to the floor!" [laughter and applause] some women, you just can't satisfy them. Die hard batteries or not, I tell you. But hey seriously we got a great show for you tonight, so stay tuned. We'll be right back Do it Gord! [music plays] [music plays] [christmas music] "For Joey, love Mom." Looking for that special gift for that hard to please child? a Wilber! You got me a Wilber!

[laughter] [applause] [music plays] WGOR Hi! I'm a retired police officer in my spare time I like to dabble in electrical devices I'm pretty good with things like VCRs the one thing I wanted to see when I was a cop was a good old electrocution, I wanted to see somebody fry but they abolished capital punishment here in oh is it ok to say where we are? well they abolished the death penalty here so what I did was to make me my own electric chair now I won't bore you with all those technical aspects, but suffice it to say I got a 220 line running into this suckerp[laughter] well that'll fry a fricken elephant if I can get that son of a bitch into this chair here, well why don't I introduce you all to my wife, Millie! hi! I'm Millie, I helped to build this beauty and I helped to capture this criminal who's gonna fry in a few minutes, so, what I did was to get all dressed up with my best jewels dripping from me and walked down the worst street in the city and within minutes what do you know? Up comes junior here with a knife, and well I just maced his ass and we drugged him up and we brough him home. Instant justice! now if this damn contraption will work good at all we'll have a pretty good video for the show, are you ready honey? yeah just about, just give me a minute to get this nice and tight yeah, well I guess that just about does it ok sonny! the verdicts in, the jury finds you guilty! as charged, and I sentence you to die! in this homemade hotseat [laughter] well honey, how many volts do you think we oughta give him!? how the hell do I know? Try some low volts and keep goosing it until it bursts that sounds like a good idea to me, well here goes! [Laughter] [electric sounds and laughter] It ain't doing it, it ain't doing it we gotta do something, needs more juice or something it ain't working! come on, come on oh! Now goose it up honey! goose it up! Goose it up now! look at that son of a bitch jump! more more! alright put it up to full! wow! wooo! that's gonna do it! [laughter] well! Howard and Eli how'd you like that one! [music plays] Well that certainly was quite impressive the act incredible and while the execution was a bit sloppy, it does warrant repeated viewing I concur Howard, I particularly like the wife oh yeah she exhibited a certain Je ne sais pas which I found very refreshing, I really like to see more of her in the future, speaking of which, I'd like to point out to our audience that we gave Debbie here a little something to put on because we know there are children watching so Debbie tell us, what did you think of the video? [muffled screams] not talking eh? well why don't you just life your fingers to designate how many stars four fingers being the best It seems she has no opinion, perhaps we can persuade her Eli if we have to how about the old puppet on a vein schtick right you are Eli, we have those surgical scissors? certainly! the first cut is yours ah thank you sir, you're a true gentleman [laughter] Hey Howard What? Oh right! you got it now? wait a minute, uh yeah ok now I just put the scissor in right there it goes, ah [screaming] [screaming] Ah there we go [laughter and screaming] Now let's see, we got a clean cut here Ow there we go [laughter and screaming] oh god [laughter] let's see, let's see how many fingers she gives it now Eli!

Action. [music plays] [music plays] WGOR [laughter] I think we should take care of this bitch here [groans] [laughter] I don't think she's going anywhere now [groans] Howard and Eli, they are fantastic I love these guys [Laughter] [disgust and laughter] she loves it Oh my god [laughter] let's cut this one up in pieces that poor girl [screaming] she loves it this is my favorite here [laughter] you need more of that I swallowed my gum boy that was a great scene shhh, I wanna hear what Howard and Eli have to say Stupendous! One of the most ten best! Man the fear on her face when she realized that that guy was gonna bash her in the skull with that statue of Gandhi man that was worth a million bucks! I myself was partial to the partial nudity of course she had a great set of [laughter] do you believe these guys? you're one of those ladies men Eli thanks Howard [laughter] boy those guys are really funny this the best thing that appeared on cable since Fraggle Rock the videos are great those two idiots are hysterical come on, I disagree. Those guys are chauvinists and what really bothers me is that it's always some guy hunting down and splattering some totally helpless half undressed female I'd like to see it change for once oh yeah, well put your money where your mouth is I bet you wouldn't have the guts to kill someone that girl had the guts and they're all over the floor I'm serious, I'll bet Bonnie she wouldn't have the guts to pull off a senseless gorey murder, well Bonnie? alright, I'm game. What do you have in mind? shut up, I'm hungry wanna order a pizza? there you have it, let's order a pizza and when the kid gets here, we'll videotape ourselves a little splatter film, only this time we'll rip the shit out of some innocent and unsuspecting pizza boy you're serious aren't you? sure I'm serious we can probably even show the damn thing on the Howard and Eli Show, I'm getting all hot and bothered just thinking about it! well I guess we could do as good a job as these guy, and it'd be a lot more scary and exciting, I'm game well Bonnie old chum, my bet still stands, you in or out? well what would we do with the body? depends on how we kill him, if we chop him up we could take the pieces and wrap them up in freezer wrap and bring them to the conservation center of recycling that sounds like Lerner and Lowe I think thats Leopold and Loeb dickhead you're right so how are we gonna kill him? let's cut his pecker off you really are one sick puppy aren't you? ok, what do you suggest? Certainly we have to rape him. depends on what he looks like chauvinist well let's start out by calling him and get the son of a bitch in here I'll call a place in the next town just to play it safe do you really want to go through with this? you bet your ass, this could be the most fun we've had in years and it'll probably top the crap they've been showing on the Howard and Eli Show did you see the one where they coated the girl with dog food and threw her into the pound with all those strays, the cameraman couldn't even keep the camera steady and there were no closeups, it stunk they promised they'd be here withing 15 minutes or we'd get 3 dollars off the price what kind of pies did you get, I'm starving I got two large, one with mushrooms and peppers and one with anchovies and meatballs you guys are retarded, how could you think of food at a time like this? oh I'm so hungry that if the pizza boy looks half as good as the pie I'll eat him you're disgusting you know it, ok now when he gets here let me lead the action, but I need the total participation of both of you are you in or out? you bet okay YES!

That's what keeps people coming in here to sample my speciality. And now onto our program, folks it is my pleasure to introduce to you a new time saving user friendly and FUN to operate gadget that no one should be without you see, to fully appreciate the slice and dicer you need a live body, preferably female and one that will co-operate and now the slice and dicer, it slices and dices it shatters and splatters, and it's so simple to operate all you do is put the item to be chopped in the moldable slot line it up just right and push down hard and quickly! well Otto it needs a few refinements however uh, each finger did slice is uniformly sliced and the palm is still in tact [humming] and perfect for the famous finger sandwich [laughter] and when it is perfected the slice and dicer will cut through nails make mince meat of bones and still stay sharp cut after cut after cut, our next item is for the vampire in all of you, the drac-o-matic you need to have your subject in an upright position which means tie her to a chair or suspend her arms from the ceiling or have your assitant help you Now the blood dispense will work in almost any part of the body but if you hit a major artery you run the risk of too strong a flow so I try a flesh part, like the tush or the chest! [laughs] Deli Dicks homemade all nature lemonade, no preservatives! will render your victim semi-conscious, euphoric and very co-operative, and now the drac-o-matic, find your mark in one of the Poconos uh polka dots. notice how, notice how easily it slides into the muscles now once everything is set, get yourself a class adjust the flow turn her on and fill her up!

I wonder if you can guess who this is let me give you a hint, my wife and I used to live in New York my husband used to run a movie theater. I used to work for a big legal firm we moved into your town a little over a year ago, and became very close friends. got any ideas yet or do you need some more clues? well how about, a 1978 green dodson B210, do you remember what it looked like from the back of a stolen back renegade? they gotta be fucking kidding us remember a kid by the name of Rick Carlson? Boy it must have been some job to try and carry his body out through the door in the back of my Video Studio Jesus Christ, we cut them up into 6900 pieces what kind of shit is this? [laughter] I bet you two guys think you cut us up into a thousand little tiny pieces, well look again holy shit! yes fellows, it took quite a lot of work to patch us back together again but between the finest surgeons and plastic surgeons we're here to tell the tale and what a tale it is don't forget, we know everything we can name names, we know about Reggie Hawd. and we know about the Sheriff that was pretty funny, him pretending not to know how to run a VCR, he had me fooled and when I think of what I really ate when I ordered that bologna at the deli, I wanna die Now the question is, what do we do about it all? my instinct is to turn you all over to the authorities I mean afterall we know where you all live we know where your studio is, we know who mudered who and where all the bodies are buried and if you think that you can destroy all of the evidence I just want you to consider the possibility that we've already talked and the FBI is on it's way over to you right now but I think I've talked my wife out of that plan I mean afterall to me it's an eye for an eye and considering what you did to mine, I think we'll go with plan B in Plan B, we burst into your television studio and do exactly what you did to us [panicked yells] Alright sleaze bags! you fat tub of shit, freeze right where you are!
