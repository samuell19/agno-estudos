THE FILM THAT TRIUMPHED AT THE 20TH VENICE FILM FESTIVAL AND WON THE GOLDEN LION and THE PRIX DE L'OFFICE CATHOLIQUE INTERNATIONAL DU CINEMATOGRAPHE Our women love us no more Because we wear black shirts DESERTERS AND THOSE EVADING CONSCRIPTION WILL BE EXECUTED THERE AREN'T ENOUGH RUINS TO BURY ALL THE BRAVE ANYONE CAUGHT CARRYING UNAUTHORIZED FIREARMS... WILL BE EXECUTED ON THE SPOT - Is the curfew over? - Yes, it's 6:10. We're lucky it's cloudy again today. They can't bomb us so easily when it's cloudy. It's our turn. WE WILL WIN Come here! Didn't you hear us? There's no point shouting. If he doesn't speak German, he can't understand. Excuse me, sir. Is there a phone nearby? All the bars are closed now. Do you have a flat? For the fourth time. We have no more spares. There's a tire shop just around the corner. Really? Thank you. He says there's a tire shop just around the corner. Another nail planted by the partisans? Get the spare tire. Cigarette? - Thanks. Thanks. Turn right at the first corner. Recht. Thanks. Thanks. - From Genoa? - Naples. Ah, Naples. This time last year I was in Naples, at the Hotel Vesuvio. I'd open my windows and have the sea before me, with Mergellina and Posillipo on one side, Capri and Sorrento on the other. - And Auntie Teresa down below. - Right. We were sorry to leave Naples. We'd come to really love it. Your fellow townspeople, on the other hand, were pleased to see us leave. They started shooting at us out of sheer joy. Actually, I'm from Sora, between Naples and Rome. So in actual fact, I feel more Roman than Neapolitan. The Romans don't care for us much either. - Are you based in Rome? - Not anymore. I'm in Milan now. - Do you like it? - Not at all. The weather's awful, and the people are hostile and rebellious. You Italians don't like this war much. We don't like wars in general. This is a just and therefore necessary war. Don't you agree? Yes, but not everyone shares my view. Exactly. And that creates some very awkward situations. - May I be of help? - No, thanks. I should be getting to work now. Thank you, Mr... Grimaldi. I'm an engineer. Colonel M?ller. I hope we meet again. I hope so too. - What time is it? - It's only 6:00. Go back to sleep. Were you out gambling again? Don't worry. We'll talk later. Did anyone call? - Did you lose again? - I asked you a question. How would I know? Ask Maria. - Maria. - Who is it? It's me. Did anyone call? Yes. That lawyer, Mr. Borghesio, called twice. - No one else? - No. - Oh, yes - Mrs. Camelli. - Cantelli. What did she want? She said, "Tell the colonel that my brother's been released." She sends her regards and thanks. - Released? Are you sure? Yes, she said he's back home. Released! I don't understand these Germans. - Shall I make some coffee? - No, go back to sleep. Oh, and a package arrived. I put it in the dining room. THIS PACKAGE IS FOR MY FATHER. I HOPE YOU'LL GET IT TO HIM. Salami again. They already cut off the electricity. Valeria, I'm in trouble. You have to help me. What do you want? Give me something I can pawn. Just for a few days. You had a wad of big bills last night. I'm an unlucky bastard. Borghesio gave me 100,000 lira for his son, and I gambled it all. I wanted to round up the 50,000 I was owed, and it was supposed to be my night. I'd lost the night before, so last night I should've won. That damn bastard jinxed me and won the whole thing. It was an awful night. Only God knows what I've been through! I'm taking these risks for you too. You think I don't feel responsible having a woman like you? That I don't feel bad not giving you the life you deserve? You've said that for three months. I know it by heart. You can't charm me anymore. Hello? My dear Mr. Borghesio. No, you're not disturbing me. I'm an early bird. News? Things are looking up. What was that? Did the order come through? No, not yet. But everything will be sorted out this morning. I know. I understand your concern. But don't despair. Go ahead and tell your wife. Tell the poor woman everything will be all right. You have to trust me. I've taken this matter to heart. I don't even sleep nights. I've spoken to him. It will be resolved today, come what may. Don't worry. Don't worry. Valeria, this is a matter of life and death. I must give that stingy German the 50,000 I owe him before noon or he'll send Mr. Borghesio's son to Germany. What's that to me? Give me something I can pawn just for two days - You already made off with my emerald earrings. I'll get them back, I swear. Don't you believe me? - No. - Don't be so cruel. I swear I won't gamble anymore. - Do what you like. I'm leaving anyway. - Where are you going? Turin. I got a job at a radio station. - Doing what? - Singing, you fool! Dancing and acting. I'll start living at last! You don't realize that these are wretched times, full of danger. But I'll do anything. I've got some irons in the fire. I'm organizing some shows for the armed forces. When the war ends, I'll put you on stage in revues. All your friends will envy you. You've made lots of promises. Can I help it if all my assets are down south? "Down south" again! I'm not sure the south even exists anymore. Well? Well, what? If you'd just lend me your necklace and bracelet - And my ring and brooch too? I said no! It's no use insisting. Why don't you pawn this ring you gave me? The one with the oriental sapphire. Take it. Try pawning that. Think I didn't know it was fake? Idiot! The man who can trick Valeria hasn't been born yet. I never said a word because I'm a lady. Doria? You can go in. - Is Sergeant Major Hageman in? - He's busy, but you can go in. - May I? - Come in. But give me just a moment. He was arrested three weeks ago outside San Giorgio. The prison in Marassi sent me here. - His name? - Canevari, Alberto. - Check on that, please. - Right away. Canevari, Alberto. He's the communist who was executed last week. No, he's not a communist. My husband's not involved in politics. I swear on my little girl's life. She said he was arrested with communists. But if he's honest and not involved in politics, he'll be released. - But when? - That's not my decision. May I visit him and take him some clean clothes? You'll have to ask the warden. Thank you. - Excuse me, please. - Wait. I'm busy. - Ladies first. - Well? We're looking for Lieutenant Michele Fassio. He was arrested in Savona last Thursday. - Are you family? - I'm his wife. I'm his mother. My son's never been involved in politics. He fought in Africa and Albania and received a silver medal. You said Michele Fassio? Please, Miss Sieglinde. Lieutenant Michele Fassio, son of Angelo and Matilde Masuero, born in Varigotti on the June 8, 1916? Yes. Lieutenant Fassio was arrested for being a member of the armed brigades that attack our troops and oppose the legitimate government of the Italian Social Republic. That's not true! He stayed at his father's villa after the 8th of September. When he was supposed to report for military service. An Italian officer doesn't need to be told his duty. Calm down, Carla. The gentleman was simply saying that Michele should have reported. You must understand: They're just boys. So much has happened. He was upset by it all. These are difficult times for everyone. It calls for understanding on both sides. The propaganda of hate maddens the soul. But don't lose hope. Our German friends are nearly always very understanding. Let's go, Mother. I told you we could hope for nothing from these people. She's a fiery one! - Coffee, Colonel? - Real coffee, yes. But if it's like last time - - It is. All right. Thanks. You're always very kind, miss. I saw Mr. Borghesio. - Well? He couldn't raise the money, but he gave me something much more valuable. An oriental sapphire set in platinum. That's of no use to me. I said 50,000, and that's that. - But this is worth much more. - I want the money. - Precious stones are a good investment. - But money can't be traced. - A sapphire is a sapphire. - I want the money. Don't be stubborn. Where would I get it? It's simple. If that ring is worth more than 50,000 lira, sell it and keep the rest. But it's a shame. I wanted you to have it. You'll marry one day, won't you? "One day..." So much could happen before then. Here's your coffee. So we're agreed then. Always at your service. Thanks for everything, Sergeant Major. Good-bye. Shall we help Mrs. Fassio? No, it's a lost cause, and I don't like that woman. I do. Remember: I'll be waiting tomorrow morning. I'll be here. Ladies, I'll be waiting in that bar. I have good news. Please sit down. Have a seat. I am Colonel Grimaldi. The Gospel says, "Judge not, lest ye be judged." Don't be fooled by appearances, ma'am. I told you my name, but don't ask why I'm friends with the Germans. These blue stripes show I served my country with loyalty and honor. Our country that's so scorned and downtrodden. Three coffees - real ones. - Neapolitan style? - Yes. Forgive me for approaching you so abruptly, but these are dangerous times. I'll get to the point. I must be discreet about certain matters, just as you must be about others. I trust I've made myself clear. I mean that, given the circumstances, we must exercise a certain discretion. Listen, Colonel, let's be very clear. If you can help my husband, just tell me how. - Carla! - Let's get to the crux of it. You asked me if I can help your husband. I'm saying, "Within the limits of my capacity." But whether true or false, the accusations are very serious. Someone's waiting for me - a case very related to yours. I hope I've been of some small help to him. We Italians must help each other, despite the hatred. Excuse me. I'll be right back. He seems like a good person. You can relax. Your son won't be sent away. Thank you for all you've done, and all you will do. But do you think he'll be released? We can't expect too much. Let's just be glad he's not leaving. Then we'll see about the rest. I have a little business proposal. - Go ahead. Two ladies are in financial trouble and need to sell a family heirloom. An oriental sapphire. Very nice. A marvelous stone. Only 50,000 lira. 50,000? Where would I get that? To raise the 100,000 lira I gave you, I had to mortgage my house on very unfavorable terms. I can imagine. But I can show it to someone else. No, don't bother. Good-bye, sir. - Thank you so much. - Don't worry. Forgive me. You haven't drunk your coffee? It's the real stuff. We always drink real coffee at home. We have tons of it. Don't mind her. She's beside herself. Don't abandon us. Don't worry. Colonel, if there's anything you need - You think Michele will be freed because his father's rich, but what about all the others they've arrested? Will you pay for them all? - Leave it to me. Where can I find you? Call us. The name is Fassio. 86386. Fassio... 86386. Very good. I hope to have news about your son soon. Thank you. Good-bye. No news from the front at Anzio. An enemy bomber was destroyed by our fighters. Two Italian planes are missing. This has been the news... Hello, Mrs. Pina. I have a bargain for you, an oriental sapphire. It was my mother's. One of a kind. Just 100,000 lira. It's lovely, but I can't. You can give me part now and the rest later. I'd love to, but I can't. These are hard times. Let's say 50,000 now, and you cancel my tab. You mustn't tempt me. I really can't. I managed to find some meat. Hello. What's going on? Just a little business matter. Bye, Michele. Good-bye. It's a real bargain. An oriental sapphire. Just look at it. I thought of you. - It's beautiful. - 80,000 lira. It's lovely, but I'm not interested. I'm sorry, but no. - You're sure? - I'm sorry. It is very beautiful though. It's a bargain. An oriental sapphire. It belongs to a Jewish woman. She has to sell. She'll take 70,000 lira. - No, thanks. I'm not interested. We're closed until 2:00. I'm a friend of Miss Olga's. Open up, please. - She's eating. - Tell her it's an old friend. Who is it? Olga, it's me. Emanuele! How did you find me? I ran into a friend of yours the other day - Evelina. The other day? She left three weeks ago. I wanted to come earlier, but I've been so busy. I can imagine. So why have you come now? I'm so happy to see you. I thought you'd feel the same. Really? - I see I was wrong. - That's right. You were wrong. - Good-bye, then. - Olga, it's getting cold. - Madam Vera! - Emanuele! What a surprise! How are you? What brings you to Genoa? The house in Livorno was bombed, so I was sent here. Why didn't you tell me Emanuele was here? Have you eaten? - Not really. - Join us for lunch. - I don't want to impose. Don't be silly. Come on. We have to catch up. I haven't seen you in years! Do you mind? Me? She's the boss. All right, then. Come with me. Let him sit down. Olga! - Hello, ladies. - Serve the food, please. What have you been up to? Where have you been? Here and there. Sometimes up, sometimes down. Right. Sometimes up, sometimes down. But you're looking good, Madam Vera. - Oh, I get by. - How's business? Not good. With the curfew at 9:00 and everyone so worried - I know. What about you? Apart from gambling. I've given that up... more or less. I'm an honest man now. You don't say! - I buy and sell jewels. - Like you used to. No, not like that. I sell these now. How beautiful! Let me see. It's lovely. Let me see. It's magnificent. It's an oriental sapphire. It's a good time to buy. People need to sell things. The lira's losing value, but not precious stones. It's beautiful, but what does it cost? Not much. 50,000 lira. It belongs to the wife of a big shot. Her husband stayed down in Sicily. - But 50,000 lira - - I'll buy it. - You? - Won't you sell it to me? But Madam Vera and this lady here liked it. - If Olga likes it - - I'll give you a check. Don't you trust me? - It's not that. What then? Has it been long since you saw her? - Yes. - Since Livorno? Yes. Then we went on to La Spezia... She's changed so much. She's always moody and argumentative. If I didn't love her like a sister - You want Madam Vera to sign it too? Excuse me. Emanuele! Come in here. If Madame Vera or one of the girls had bought it, you'd have taken the money. So why not from me? Why did you give me a check when you knew it was fake? Here's 30,000 lira. It's all I have. Will it do? Why are you doing this for me? I don't know. Or maybe I do. You hurt me so bad, but we had happy days together too. The only happy days of my life. I live in the memory of those days. No! Go away! Go away... and never come back. Ladies, come to the salon. 10,000 in the bank. Place your bets. Once again... - Bank. - No bets. Card. Card. The bank has nine. Good for the bank. It's baccarat. 19,500. Place your bets. - Bank. - No bets. The bank has eight. There's still a bank. Here's your money. Take it. Don't worry. It's nothing. Send this message: "The piano tuner has arrived." Stop or I'll shoot! I thought I could trust you, but I was wrong. You know how important it was to get Della Rovere alive. What good is a dead body to us? I gave you precise orders. - I passed them on. - That's not good enough! You should have checked they were carried out correctly. We didn't know where he'd make land. I couldn't be everywhere. You're great at excuses, but you haven't learned to obey me. A brave soldier was killed like a small-time criminal. If he hadn't died like that, he'd have died some similar way. What do you mean? We could have exchanged him for one of our generals held by the partisans. We could have held him hostage. What you did is unforgivable. I want no more mistakes. Bury the bodies of Della Rovere and his accomplice far from Genoa. They must be unidentifiable. And the troops responsible are to be sent to the Eastern front. Yes, sir! Spread the word that we've arrested Della Rovere. Yes, sir. Something has to happen. Someone will try to come to his aid. You can go. May I? Hello? Hello? I'd like to speak to Mrs. Fassio. Speaking. This is Colonel Grimaldi. Don't cry. I have good news. I've taken your case to heart. Really? You must be strong. This isn't an orthodox procedure. What are you saying? I know a fellow who's unfortunately - but also luckily for us - very greedy. Really? All right. I'll meet you in the same caf?. See you soon. Sorry I'm late. My call must have surprised you. - Not at all. I mean, you probably didn't expect me to call so soon. But ever since I left you and your mother-in-law yesterday, I've thought of nothing but how I could help you. I got to work and called all my contacts. I'm not boasting, but I know a lot of people. And so? And so? Well, it's not simple. It'll take time. And lots of money. You have no idea how greedy these Germans are. I can imagine. Here's 100,000 lira. Will that do for now? Of course. I'll deliver it right away. You wait here. I hope to bring you good news. Don't despair, ma'am. Have faith. Have faith in my friendship. - Where's the phone? - On the right. ROOM NO. 25 One moment, Colonel, and I'm all yours. Good morning. Colonel, what a surprise! What brings you to these unpleasant surroundings? Anything wrong? Yes, unfortunately. Yesterday you said this war was just and therefore necessary, and I said I agreed but that not everyone shared my view. Remember? Yes. Well, a young relative - distant, on my mother's side - is a scoundrel who doesn't share my view. His father's a famous jurist. His mother was born a noblewoman. He's descended from Garibaldi's men, but he didn't hear the call of duty. He didn't respond to his country's call, and he let himself get nabbed - I mean, he was arrested. He's to be deported to Germany. Quite rightly, of course. Why didn't he choose to fight with us? He'd have been freed immediately. - Why? - Yes, why? - You want to know? - I'm curious. Out of pride! That boy has a monstrous sense of pride! He took after his great-grandfather. And he said, "If I fight alongside our German colleagues, it may look like I'm doing it to avoid the concentration camps. I don't want our brave German colleagues to think I'm a coward." - I'll see what I can do. - Can you speak to Captain Schrantz? I don't need to speak to anyone, my dear man. Come with me. This way. - What's the man's name? - Vittorio Borghesio. Get me Vittorio Borghesio's information. This says that in addition to being a deserter, he was involved in illegal activities. If we believed everything the police said - My dear man, I am the police. Well, if all policemen were like you - I don't care for flattery. This Borghesio is to remain in Genoa. He's on the transfer list. - Take him off the list. - Yes, sir. The problem's resolved. He stays here. Happy? You're lucky you're able to do some good! It doesn't happen often, unfortunately. I'll give his poor parents the news. Let me thank you and bless you on their behalf. I don't like thanks or blessings. I hope you'll come by again. - I will. And thank you, Colonel. I've got good news! I just need to make a call. I'll be right back. Mr. Borghesio, please. It's the colonel. Mr. Borghesio? Victory! No, not Vittorio. Or rather, yes - victory for Vittorio. He won't be leaving, and he may be released. I'll tell you when I see you. Let your wife know the good news. No, I don't like thanks or blessings. See you soon, my friend. Madam, your husband's fine. The path is long and complicated, but it leads to freedom. My husband is already free, my dear colonel. He was shot yesterday behind the Staglieno cemetery. Shot? - Then why are we - - Yes, why indeed? - Come with us. - There must be some horrible mistake! How long have you known this man? I met him three or four months ago. I was performing in revues in Mondov?. I'm a serious actress, but times are hard and you have to make do. And if you're talented, even revues - - Try to be brief. How did you meet this man? I told you, in Mondov?. I was going home with some friends after a show. We'd been out late to dinner, and that damn curfew had started. A patrol car wanted to arrest us, and the colonel intervened. - What colonel? - Him. Why, are you a colonel too? Later... I'll explain later. - Right. Go on. - He took us to our hotel. - Then? Well, one thing led to another. He made me leave my job. - Go on. - He brought me to Genoa. He promised me the world. "Once the south is freed..." What's his line of business? Tell me the truth, for your own good. I only know he got lots of phone calls, and he had a lot of visitors with packages. Containing what? Clothes, food... a lot of salami. I ate so much salami that I broke out in a rash. Look! The lady can go. That way. Bring them in. Do you know this man? Why don't you answer him? Why don't you tell him you know me? I have nothing to hide. Colonel, let me explain. Maybe I was wrong - I was wrong - but for a good reason. It started with Mrs. De Dominicis. Step forward, ma'am. She lives upstairs from me. She was distraught one day on the stairs. Her son had been arrested. Faced with a mother's anguish, what else could I do? I said, "I'll try and help." Isn't that right, ma'am? - Yes. Then the others came to me. I was overwhelmed with their requests, their problems and suffering. What else could I do? I tried to help, but it was never enough! First they wanted to find their loved ones, then to send letters, and then the packages started. Then they wanted me to keep them from being sent to Germany, and then even get them released. What should I have done? Tell me. Put yourself in my shoes. I tried to help. Then I learned the terrible truth. That they slept ten to a cell, standing up like horses, that they were beaten and tortured and packed into sealed trains headed for Mauthausen. And I kept quiet. I didn't have the heart to tell them. Would you have rather I told you? No! Better to let them hope. Only I knew the truth. - Let them go. - Yes, sir. You're all free to go. Come with me. Now tell me what you prefer. You can be tried as a colonel for sabotaging German war regulations and corrupting German officers. Or you can simply be Emanuele Bardone, son of the late Luigi and Teresa Camarano, born in Sorrento on May 3, 1894, and be charged with fraud and impersonating an officer. Is that a choice? In the first case, I'd be shot. In the second, I'd get three years at most. "Impersonating an officer" is a joke. Article 498 provides for a fine of 1,000 to 10,000 lira. It's Article 310 that's a bit troublesome regarding crimes committed during wartime. But this blessed war has to end one day, and there'll be an amnesty like last time. You were an officer in the cavalry. You were expelled from the army for debt and embezzlement. Then you were convicted four times for fraud, swindling the disabled, possession and dealing of drugs, and even bigamy! If you'd stayed in the army, you could be wearing a real colonel's uniform today. Maybe even a general's. Hageman, Bardone's accomplice, has confessed. What? Sergeant Major Walter Hageman has confessed. Then punish him accordingly. Here. Listen, I want to help you. Despite everything, I like you. - May I say something? - Go ahead. I like you too, despite everything. Bardone, I have a proposal for you. Of course Della Rovere had a marvelous career! He married a general's daughter. His aunt, Marquise Barrino, died in 1928, leaving him sole heir. He's suspected of being a Mason, and his uncle is a monsignor. These types make me laugh. I'm a self-made man. Listen, these notes mention that he speaks fluent English, French and German. I know a few words of French. "Place your bets, gentlemen." "All bets have been placed." All bets have been placed, eh? You know the cause of all my troubles? Gambling. I always lose. What's worse, I pay. And I've never cheated. I hope I won't be the first to find otherwise. This is no game we're playing, Colonel. Heil Hitler, Lieutenant Colonel. Come on. Get me the senior squad leader. What if someone here in San Vittore recognizes me? I doubt it. Common criminals aren't mixed in with political prisoners. I didn't mean them. I was talking about the guards and chaplains. They often get transferred from one prison to another. Chaplains aren't allowed in the political sector. I don't trust priests. They're all spies. What about the others? Right. If anything should happen, call me right away. May God help us. Hold this prisoner, but don't register him. No fingerprints and no photographs. Keep him under surveillance and in isolation. Make sure you treat him with the utmost respect. - Yes, sir. - All right, then. Come with me. Follow me. I may not see you again, so I'll thank you now for all the kindness you've shown me in this embarrassing situation. Any German officer would have done the same. I should like to believe you. Give my regards to Field Marshal Kesselring when you see him. Tell him that just because we're now on different sides doesn't mean I admire or respect him less. I will, Mr... Follow me, please. Who's come in, the Shah of Persia? - Where? - Basso Piave. - When? - July, 1918. The Battle of the Solstice. What unit? - 131st Avellino Brigade. Great soldiers. Well done. Will you set up my bed? - I'll call the attendant. - Take good care of him. - All right. Water, sir! Banchelli, come out here. - Set up his bed. - Help me. Don't bother, sir. I'll get someone else. Cold, huh? If you're staying here a while, ask for a different cell. The ground floor is really damp. Thanks for the tip. May I? My name's Aristide Banchelli. - Of the cotton family? - I wish! I'm just a poor typesetter. - Have you been here long? - Eight months. Are you involved in politics? We're all involved in politics here. - General Della Rovere. - I'll be damned! Sorry. You've come from outside. How are things going? - Help him set up the bed. - All right. - Where are my things? - In the storeroom, sir. - But I need them. - Tell me what you need. My slippers, my pajamas, some shirts and my wool scarf. And my toiletries. - I'll bring them, sir. General Della Rovere's here! He's with Badoglio, from the south! General Della Rovere's here! D-E-L-L-A... R-O... V-E... R-E. - Della Rovere! - Wait. P-U... Ah, one of Badoglio's men! IT'S ALL OVER FOR YOUR SON MARIO. LIFE IS A JOKE. THE CURSED ENEMY IS GOING TO EXECUTE ME. HOLD YOUR HEAD UP HIGH. YOUR SON NEVER TREMBLED. MY NAME IS RUTILIO CASTELLINI. TO WHOMEVER READS THIS: PLEASE INFORM MY FAMILY THAT I HAVE BEEN EXECUTED. GIVE MY LOVE TO EVERYONE. GOOD-BYE, MY DARLING! I'D NEVER HAVE THOUGHT DYING WOULD BE SO EASY. The things you asked for, sir. Please have a look and then sign, please. Who were these condemned men? Young men working with the partisans in the hills. - Were they all shot? - All four of them. - Were the families informed? - Yes, by the chaplain. - Who's the chaplain? - Don Luigi Gavino. But the Germans won't allow him into this wing. - Savona, I didn't say a word. - Neither did I. This is Calandrino, seventh company. Anyone there? Calandrino, Vendetta's brother. See you outside. General Della Rovere! General Della Rovere! Can you hear me? Good evening, general. My brother was a radio telegraph operator with you in Africa. Micheluzzi, Fausto. You remember him? General! General Della Rovere, do you remember my brother? Yes, I remember him. General, talk facing the door, or your voice gets garbled. Yes, I remember him. General, when are they coming? The Americans are taking their time! Antonio! I didn't see you outside. - I fell down the stairs. - Did you hurt yourself? - Yes. Sir, I'm Lieutenant Carlo Maria Mida. And I'm Deputy Chief Carlo Frassinetti. We were arrested in La Spezia by the Germans and convicted. At your service, sir. I'm General Della Rovere. Be strong, boys! - Good evening. - Where's Fabrizio? He's coming on the 5:10 train. Come with me. - Any news? - He was taken to San Vittore today, accompanied by Colonel M?ller. He didn't go through registration. He's in block 5 on the ground floor, cell 39. - We're sure it's him? - Of course. And so are the Germans. - How did they recognize him? - They were expecting him. - They have spies everywhere. - That doesn't surprise me. They were our allies 10 months ago. - Mussolini's allies! That doesn't change anything. We should have freed him on the trip from Genoa to Milan. - He might have gotten killed. - We have to contact him. It won't be easy. The guards we know have been transferred. Still, we have to contact him at all costs. What's taking Fabrizio? The station's just 10 minutes away. - Maybe he had to walk. - Annamaria's meeting him on her bike. - Maybe he never left Cernobbio. - He'd have let us know. - It's late. - Here's Annamaria now. Here's Annamaria. - Where's Fabrizio? - He was arrested. - Where? - Near Piazza Castello. We were caught in a raid. He tried to escape, but his bike got stuck in the streetcar tracks and he fell. The fascists locked him up in a truck with some other poor souls. Were there many prisoners? About 80, three trucks full. - You know where they took them? - No. I followed the trucks. I saw a bag fall from the one Fabrizio was in. No one else noticed. I grabbed it and came here. - Good work. They probably took them to the Cantore barracks, like usual. We'll know soon. Two in a row: first the general, then Fabrizio. But they were out to get the general. They got Fabrizio by accident. They don't know it yet. No one knows him. At worst he'll go to a work camp. We can easily free him. He could be set free tonight. His papers are in order. Let's hope so, but we should expect the worst. First of all, we have to find him. Then we must track every movement in those barracks. Who's in charge of that sector? - Virgilio. He's a smart boy, but tell him to be careful. Let's go. You go on ahead. - What is it? - Six new prisoners for you. Send them up. Why'd they bring you here at this hour? My name's Pietro Valeri. We were caught in a raid. They brought nine of us here. I don't know why. What are they doing this late? - Wait. I'll help you. - Thanks. Don't worry. They'll bring everything. What's going on? Nine new prisoners, caught in a raid. Who are they? Watch out! Here you are. My dear Bardone, you have the chance to earn what I promised you: freedom and a reward. Nine men were brought to San Vittore last night. I know. So I heard, and so I was told. One of them is called Fabrizio. That's the code name for the leader of the resistance. We're sure Fabrizio is one of them. You must identify him. - Me? General Della Rovere's first task when he arrived must have been to meet Fabrizio to coordinate the partisans' war plans. Fate destined you to meet here. Yes, but... how will I recognize him? Don't worry. He'll identify himself. And when he does, you want me to denounce him? You only have to tell me who he is. In Genoa you told me I was to be a decoy for the ducks. Now you want me to be the rifle too. For this duty, you'll receive one million lira and a safe-conduct to Switzerland. Your task will be even easier. Two of the nine men will be freed immediately. They really are who they claim to be: government officials. So you'll have just seven men to choose from. Take him back to his cell. Soup. I'm the barber too. If you need me, my name's Banchelli. Thanks. I hope it won't be necessary. I'm here by mistake. Soup. Requests! What do you need? - Two packs of cigarettes. - What about you? - Some soap. Good morning, sir. Good morning, my friend. Coffee for you. - Real coffee? - Yes, from the warden. He wanted to come in person, but he's not allowed in the political sector. The Germans don't trust even him. - Do they trust you? - No. But they need us. There's not many of them, so if you need anything - I could use a barber. Is that possible? Of course. I'll call Banchelli. - Good morning, General. - Good morning. You're the barber too? - If you trust me. I do. I hope you won't be sorry. I don't do this often. May I? I'll take that. Did you sleep well, sir? Yes. - Is your bed soft? - Not bad. Our beds are like planks. But I don't care. I sleep less, but I live more. The German military court has sentenced me to death. They say I blew up a munitions train. But it seems they've forgotten about me. I've been waiting to be executed for three months. Sorry. Maybe they can't find another barber. Sorry. "The wind blows from the west." When did you get this? This morning. From whom? From whom? The barber, a certain Banchelli. Damn it! I know the one. He'd rather die than talk. What should I do? Calm down. Reply with another note. Tell him you don't trust him. Force Fabrizio to reveal himself. Write back, "Let's wait for the wind to die down." Give the note to Banchelli and wait. Open up! Open up! Open up! Open up! Go ahead! Drop your bombs! I'm not scared! Open up! Open up! We have to quiet them down! We have to calm the men down! Open up! Friends... this is General Della Rovere. Show some dignity and self-control! Act like men! Show these swine that you're not scared of dying. They should be scared! Every bomb that falls brings them closer to the end and brings us closer to freedom. My wife visited me, the poor woman. She brought our son along. He's grown so much. A handsome boy, and not just because he's mine. What'll happen to them? I won't see them again. Don't throw it so high! Let the others in! - There are six of them. - Good. Stop! Get going! Go on! How can a man who's spent so many years in prison not even send a note without getting caught? Now our plan's ruined. I'll have to make Banchelli talk. I hate doing these things. Put him in solitary. - Yes, sir. Come in. Have a seat. - Cigarette? - No, thanks. My dear Banchelli, you've been sentenced to death. Your days are numbered. I'm offering you a chance to save yourself. General Della Rovere admitted that he gave you a note. This one here. Tell me who it was for, and you'll have my word: I'll have your death sentence reduced to 30 years in prison. And we both know that the war won't last that long. But I know nothing, sir. Someone gave me the note when I came in from the yard. Yes, and you hid it in your shoe. I was going to give it back to the general. Banchelli, you're no idiot, and neither am I! I know the note wasn't for you. The general was using you to get it to someone else. Who? Who knows? He didn't tell me. Why don't you ask him? Why are you all so stubborn? You know we have ways of making you talk! You know that! - I know. But even you can't force a man to tell you what he doesn't know. Colonel, I have a wife and son. I saw them today. I'm all they've got. Don't you think I'd tell you if I knew? I'm asking you for the last time. Don't force me to use methods that go against my principles. I wish I could, believe me. Let's go, Banchelli. Come in. Countess Della Rovere is here. - Where? - She's waiting outside. Show her in. Colonel M?ller? That's me. Have a seat, Countess. You must be surprised to see me. In a certain sense. His Eminence advised me to come to you. He said you would understand and help me. Within the limits of my duty, of course. But let me ask you something. Our sources assured us that you and your children were in Switzerland. I must deduce that you have returned to Italy. Don't worry. I won't charge you with illegal reentry. I was just asking to pay tribute to your courage and devotion. I'm just doing what I have to. I haven't come to plead on my husband's behalf. That would be useless, and my husband wouldn't approve. I've only come out of my hope and desire to see him, if only for a few moments. Believe me, I'm very sorry that I cannot fulfill your request. But prisoners aren't allowed visitors during the inquiry period. I didn't ask for a visit, but just to see him for a few moments. Countess, I understand how you feel, and I'll prove it. You may see your husband, and even talk to him. But think about it first. General Della Rovere has been arrested on serious charges. He's calm and serene, behaving like the soldier he is, I can assure you. You know what gives him strength and courage? Knowing not only that he's done his duty as a soldier, but also that his loved ones are safe and far away. So I ask you, do you think seeing you for a few moments behind a screen, seeing you worried and in risk of danger, will be of comfort to him? Or rather would it have a negative effect on his morale? I speak to you as a friend. I have the deepest admiration and regard for the general, and I regret that this war has placed us on opposite sides. Follow my advice and don't visit him. It would upset him greatly, I'm sure. Let him think you're safe with his children. Write him a letter if you'd like. I'll tell him that His Eminence gave it to me. His Eminence will forgive this small lie. I give you my word that it won't be opened. Perhaps you're right. If you'd like, you could send him some clothes and something to eat. The food here is unfortunately... just what it is. Thank you. Banchelli! Damn them! General, I didn't say a word, but I don't know if I can hold out again. It was terrible. Why didn't you talk? Why should you pay for someone else? General... God! I don't know what I'm saying anymore! General... do you know who Fabrizio is? Drink some of this. Banchelli, have some soup. You'll feel better. Banchelli killed himself! Banchelli's dead! Open up! I want to speak to Colonel M?ller! Banchelli's dead! It's all your fault! If you hadn't been so stupid, they wouldn't have found the note, and we'd know who Fabrizio is now! Instead we have another dead man on our hands! Now go! I'm not going back out there. By now everyone knows that Banchelli was tortured, that he killed himself. They won't believe I'm General Della Rovere. They'll kill me! The guards themselves might kill me! They're on their side! No such thing will happen. You'll be welcomed back as a victim... and a hero. Take him away. They tortured General Della Rovere! They tortured General Della Rovere! Murderers! Murderers! There's a letter and a package for you, sir. A letter for me? Open it. There's a picture - must be your wife and children. What does it say? I can't make it out. You read it. It's from Geneva. "Dear Gianni, I hope these few words reach you. Our consul told me of your arrest. I've told the boys. They were very good. They didn't cry. I didn't cry either. We read the letter you wrote after the 8th of September, and we remember your words: 'When you don't know which path to take, choose the hardest one.' The boys are fine. They're doing well at school. I'm proud of them. At all times, in every situation, whatever may happen, we'll be worthy of you, my darling. We pray for you and hold you in our thoughts and hearts. God cannot permit that we never see each other again. The boys and I send you all our love. Bianca Maria." Show me the picture. They're handsome boys, sir. They killed the fascist party secretary in Milan. Oh, God! What'll happen to us? They killed the party secretary in Milan. They killed the party secretary in Milan. - Camerata Gaetano D'Accosta. - Present among us! We must carry out a massive house-by-house search. Milan is a working city. Dragnets and deportations would disturb its productive rhythm. We can't allow our best men to be ambushed in the heart of Milan. The partisan war is a reality. Reprisals only make the situation worse. So you want us to do nothing and wait to be killed? If it were German soldiers, you'd think differently. Perhaps it's not thinking that's called for. I've informed the high command on the southwest front, the Wehrmacht high command, and the F?hrer's headquarters. I'm awaiting orders. Colonel M?ller's office, Senior Lieutenant Haftig speaking. Yes, right away. Colonel, it's the Wehrmacht high command. Colonel M?ller speaking. Thank you. Good morning, Field Marshal. Yes, I understand. He doesn't agree. He says reprisals have the opposite effect. He'll carry out orders. Draw up a list of 20 men. Next to each man's name write his race, occupation, offense, and sentence. Yes, sir. The execution will be tomorrow at dawn in the prison courtyard. Good-bye, Colonel. Good-bye. The list is ready, sir. Would you like to see it? - Why are there only five Jews? - The others were deported yesterday. There are only women and children left. Add General Della Rovere to the list, and the nine men we arrested yesterday. But they're in pretrial custody. Just do as I say. Here's the list. But there are ten names here. Remove Oliviero Scotti. He was released yesterday. Colonel M?ller's office. The archbishop's office, sir. I'm afraid the colonel's not here. If they're really taking us to Germany, why didn't they say to bring our things? But you're not being investigated. This is just a routine check. - They're verifying our identity. - That's what I said. Damn it, we've been here another night! Admit it: You were starting to get worried, but no one wanted to say it. They're sending us to work. I say they're sending us to Germany. Then they'd have said to bring our things, but they didn't. That means we'll be coming back soon. - Even the general's here. - So we're not going to Germany. Why? Can't he work too? The Germans don't give a damn about Italian generals. Right? Maybe it's to work on some railway or road around here. They must need laborers after all the bombings. And you're not under investigation. General, you have to do something. What can I do? I told you, but you wouldn't believe me. We're being sent to work. We thought they were killing 10 of us for the one fascist killed. But now there's 20 of us. The general couldn't care less about us. Don't you get it? He's a hero. We're here because of him and the other would-be heroes among you. You could have been spared, but not you! You thought you'd win the war by dropping a few bombs and killing eight Germans? Well, I'm not to blame. I didn't do anything! It's a general's duty to be a hero. That's what you're paid for. In fact, I paid you. I happen to be a taxpayer. You needn't take it so hard. We'll work a few days and - No, I didn't do anything! Open up! I want out! You should be ashamed. Why? Because I don't want to die? I didn't do anything! - Neither did we. - But you're Jews. - That's right. Don't get worked up. You say you did nothing - It's true. I did nothing. That's the problem. You did nothing. Why not? The world's been at war for five years. Millions have died. Hundreds of cities have been leveled. And you did nothing. You should have done something, taken one side or the other. You wanted to be in the midst of it all and do nothing but worry about your business. In fact, you told me you made handsome profits while others were dying. Very convenient! Now I see why you don't want to be executed without having done anything. - What did you do? - Not much. But I did my duty, because that's what matters: doing your duty no matter what happens. If everyone had done that, maybe we wouldn't be here. My Jewish brothers... there's no hope for us now. Let us pray to God. Our Father who art in heaven... Who'd have thought we'd meet in here? I waited a long time for the piano tuner to arrive. I wouldn't say I'm a bank clerk, but I'm not much better. I was never a soldier, but I found myself in charge of thousands of men. I was able to bear such an enormous responsibility because I believed I was fighting for a better world. Will we live to see it? Will others? I think so. Excuse me, General. I want to send my wife a message, but there's no pen or paper. I want to ask her to forgive me for having abandoned her, for leaving her and my children alone. I want to ask forgiveness for making her suffer and tell her to be strong. I want to tell her I've always loved her and the children, even if I couldn't show it... and to get my money back from the mechanic, and that I gave the bike to Giulia's brother. She should get it back and sell it for a good price. And when better times come, she should take the children to see my parents. They've never met their grandparents. Piperno, Samuele. Ontani, Mario. Albertini, Luciano. Sinigallia, Leone. Pasquali, Antonio. Cohen, Davide. Marconi, Paolo. Leggi, Abele. Funaro, Davide. Di Castro, Giuseppe. Giovanni Braccioforte Della Rovere. Go ahead. Well? Did he talk? Do you know who he is? - Who? - What do you mean? Fabrizio. Is he one of them? He must have talked to you. During a night like this, a man confides in his companions. How would you know? Have you ever spent a night like this? Did he talk or didn't he? Do you know who he is? Do you have a pencil, Colonel? Please deliver these few words to Countess Della Rovere. Open up. Open up! MY LAST THOUGHTS ARE WITH YOU. LONG LIVE ITALY. Bardone! Open up. Look! What are you doing? They're going to die! Gentlemen, in these final moments, we remember our families, our country, and His Majesty the King. Long live Italy! We made a mistake, sir. Ten men were supposed to be executed. The mistake was mine, Lieutenant. All mine. Grant them eternal rest, O Lord, and may everlasting light shine upon them. May they rest in peace, amen. Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Lord. Lord, hear my voice. Let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.
