VILLAVICENCIO and MIKE DE LEON producers: SIMON ONGPIN, MA. ROSARIO N. SANTOS executive producer: ROLANDO S. ATIENZA direction: MIKE DE LEON Sunday, November Dad, can we talk about-- About what? About Noel and I. About who? Noel, my colleague at the bank. What about him? We're getting married. You're only 25 years young. Why are you in a hurry? How about the board exam? I'd never pass the exam. What kind of answer is that? I've already thought this through. I'm pregnant. For how many months? Two months already. Are you sure? So this is where everything ends up. [conversing in Ilocano] What does this Noel Manalansan do? He's a co-worker in our section. What does he do?! Credit Investigator. Credit Investigator, huh. What is it?! Can he even support you? Go to sleep. Sunday, November I'm not sure if there are any other fathers out there like Dad I don't even want to meet one, if there's any. For how long do I have to endure this house? How did it happen? How did what happen? How did it happen? How did you get pregnant? Dad, what kind of question is that? I took care of you. Watched over you. - I gave you everything- - Don't you worry, Dad. Noel's a good person. Tell Noel that I need to talk to him I will. Thanks, Dad. Here's the lady, whose hips are wiggly Headless, but her mouth's open. Eyeless, but she's blinded by the light. Do you know the answer to that riddle? You don't know? I'm afraid not. This. Headless, and all-mouth It has no eyes, but is afraid of the light. Ever touched one of these? Try it. - What? Are you afraid? - No, sir. Here, touch it. It's clean. It's not the same as the ones that grow in your intestines. You know, once you're retired... ...you still need to get busy. - How old are you, by the way? - 26. You're still young. It will be a while before you grow your own worms. What are you thinking about? Nothing. Really? Maybe you were thinking that I'm going mad because I grow worms. Not really. I actually read in the paper... that you may earn lots from earthworms. Oh, your wage will never match. These cost 30 pesos per kilo. More expensive than meat. I earn better here than when I was in police service. Where do you sell those? From where are the Manalansans? We're from Bulacan. - Are you ready for the married life? - Yes. I think I'm ready. Mila and I will sort it out. You're smaller than my daughter, right? Why did you do that? What, sir? I don't like how you hasten and hurry my daughter. You're lucky. Of all of Mila's suitors you are the only one who is invited in this house. A lot has taken interest to her... ...but no one ever set foot in here. I thank you for that, sir. When will your parents meet with us? It's up to you, sir. Whenever you want. Mid-November We thought Noel was an only child. No, he isn't, Our eldest, Pete, is currently in Saudi. What does he do there? An engineer overseeing a government housing project. And how was life there? He said, it's sad but the pay is good. - I told him... - One more? No thanks but I'm good with this one. You know, a lot of prohibitions comes with age Give Noel some. - How old are you, by the way? - 51. You're still young. I'm six years older than you. I'm retired for 2 years already, Pasay Police Force. But, you only look like 40. Beer helps with it. And a little exercise. You don't get much exercise in your line of work, do you? It is the brain that gets honed in teaching. - Am I right? - Yes. About the kids... Here's the thing. I'm not sure why are they in a hurry. But, it's already there, there's nothing for us to do. When do you plan to get married? We're thinking, maybe December 8. - What day is it? - A Tuesday, sir. Why don't you have it on a Sunday? or a Saturday? Weekdays are difficult. December 8 is good. Feast of the Immaculate Concep- -cion. That's the reason why we chose that day. Alright. December 8, it is. Just do it at night. Just so your workmates could attend. And also our relatives from the province. Marriage only happens once... ..so let's not try to make my daughter's marriage embarrassing, am I right, sir? Take Col. Diaz as your Godfather. Pasay City Police's Superintendent. He'd never say no to me. Also, Ex-Mayor Cristobal, Mila's baptism Godfather. He'd never refuse too. - As for the Godmothers-- - My Aunt... Dr. Celestino from Makati And also, our boss, Ms. Olivares. Alright. - When's the party? - We still haven't planned it yet. We only plan to invite a few friends and close relatives. Pick a good place. It's for dinner. Don't you worry on what you'd spend. It only happens once. And also not to be embarrassing with the relatives. Can you give out 10,000 pesos? 10,000 pesos? It's our family's tradition to give out... ...sab-ong Dowry. What he meant was, the dowry's 10,000 pesos. If ours is the male, we will be the one giving out. It just so happen that the bride is ours. I understand. Might also be the case with you and Dely before, right? You know... It's not me who wanted this. Please forgive my father's rudeness. Maybe he just can't accept that I'm getting married. It's okay. Don't worry. That's how traditions are. It's embarrassing. We're going. Don't worry. I got this. Are you mad at me? Dad, I'm tired. Did I do something wrong? It's all for you. What do you want to happen? For the marriage of my only daughter to look pitiful? Don't worry. Noel has already agreed. We have a saying... What is precious cannot be easily acquired. One needs to struggle for it. Then you should have raised my price! Why did you only ask for 10,000? It's not the value of sab-ong that is important. Then, why do you need to burden Noel? Where is he going to get that money? What are they going to say? You don't understand me. It's easy to get money. That's the least of Noel's problem. [Conversing in Ilocano] Maybe it's a sin... ...but I don't feel any love for my father. If you've known my father like I did, you will understand. He's awfully strict. He always use his only child as reason. I'm getting married soon, but dad still accompanies me to work. Once, I intentionally made him wait. Noel and I got out of the bank late. Good evening. I know he was hurt and I was glad. But he won't let himself be a loser. As if he does not care of whatever Noel thinks of him. He thinks that it's his right as my father to know everything that's happening. He always tag-along back when we were preparing for the wedding. Back at the Municipal office... he said that we'd be prioritized since people there knew him. At the church, he said he wanted to talk to the priest. We even asked his preference for the design of the invitation cards. I feel that as I am moving away from my father... ...the more that Noel gets closer to me. I want to help him save up for the 10,000 dowry. But my father takes hold of my money. It's a good thing the bank lent Noel some money. There's hope. Thanks to Ms. Olivares... ...my application is now at the main office. She'll follow-up on the loan's release. I'm ashamed. We're merely starting but you're already in-debt. Once we're married... you're going to share my debt. When we were invited at Noel's home... ...he proudly showed the room where we'll be staying. I know, my father was not happy of what he's heard. I know what he was thinking. His only child is leaving him. The dinner at Noel's home was quiet. Father's really got a twisted mind. Our wedding's next week. I still can't imagine what my new life is going to be. I hope, everything will turn out fine. Tuesday, December 8. Why don't we dance? Yours. Dad. Dad. What's wrong? Her blood pressure strike up again. She's tired. We better head home. Why don't we let her rest a bit? You don't need to leave so early. This is a rare occasion. We can't stay. We have to leave. - Then, we'll accompany you. - No need! Just take care of the guests and relatives. Dad? What just happened? We're heading out. Just follow us later. Don't lock up yet, we're heading out soon. - But the Mister's ordered me to lock up. - What? We're spending the night here. Why? Mom's not feeling well. I need to take care of her. But your father's there. Go take our clothes from the car. How about our hotel reservation? Just cancel it. What really is going on here? Noel, my mother's sick. If you still want us to leave, then go tell them yourself. Good evening. What time is it? Dress up. It's already lunch. I did not wake you up for breakfast. You seem to be having a nice sleep. What happened to you last night? I went crazy waiting here. I fell asleep beside mom. They didn't bother waking me up. I'm sorry, Noel. I'm only doing this for mom. - Let's not go out yet. - Someone might come in. But, we're already married. Don't shout. They might think that we are arguing. We'll, it's their fault anyway. All right. I'll take a shower. Where's the wash room? The door on the right, outside this room. Why isn't there any lock in this door? It got broken. We haven't replaced it yet. We're really sorry about this, Noel. I hope you understand. Dely insisted for Mila to massage her nape. She complains about pain all over her body. That's the problem with hens... ...they can't stop cuckling. Your honeymoon got ruined. That's alright. It's always honeymoon for you, young ones, am I right? Yes. Then spend some good time. - Why don't you go out? - We are going out. Where are you going? At our home. Onyang, I'll take care of it. Why did you bring that here? Mom, can we talk? - If it's about last night... - Why didn't you oppose him? You know that I can't go against him. What are you planning for us? Mom, how are you feeling? I'm better. Thanks to Mila. We're going home. If that's fine with you. Oh, go on. You don't need to worry about me. Just remind Onyang about my medicines. So, when you get back later, you'd have nothing to worry about. That's right. Noel, There's a favor that I'd want to tell you. What is it? Can you stay here for a few more days? If that is fine with you, of course. I don't know... I'm used to having Mila take care of me whenever I get sick. Mom, it is embarrassing to ask Noel. It's fine with me. Thanks for your understanding. Go on on your way while it is still early. We'll be on our way. Say goodbye also to your Father. Why did you agree? What do you want me to say? She's begging. You should have made up a reason not to agree. Why didn't you do it? She's your mother after all. - It should have been you. - Why me? - You're the man between us. Enough of this. We shouldn't be fighting. It's okay. It's just for a few days, right? When are you two moving here? Maybe around Friday. How are your in-laws? They're doing fine. However... Mila's father. I can't guess what's running in his head. I know what you mean. But I think that's better. As early as now, you should learn how live with them. - You spoke with Dad? - No one's picking up. They might be asleep already. I guess. I'll leave the car. We'll just ride a cab. Up to you. Good evening, Dad. Do you know what time is it? We had dinner at Noel's. Mila's been calling but no one's picking up. Leave your excuses for tomorrow. We'll just check how mom's doing. No need. She's sleeping already. Mila, the Mister is calling for you. We're coming. What are your plans for today? We plan to see a movie. - What? - Pardon? - What movie? Anything that's up. I'll take you there. No need. We'll just take a cab. It's just another expense. Cabs are expensive. [Greeting in Ilocano] That is why kids these days think in the way they are. See here, they don't watch anything other than crime... ...sex. There's murder everywhere. It's only natural that they'll imitate what they see. I handled a case before. A married couple who violently fought each other. Blood on the couch. There's blood on the floor. One night, the woman stabbed the man in his leg. The other day, it's the man who stabbed his partner on her sides. Goodness. The woman walked to the Hospital. Why didn't you arrested them then? These rascals do not want to file a case against each other. There's this one night when what happened was extreme. All the neighbors crowded the streets. Screaming. Saying there are people who are killing each other. What I did, is to break down their apartment's door. You wouldn't believe what I saw. What was it? Hey. You're not drunk yet. Drink up! No thanks. Mila do not seem to feel well. I think, I'll settle her for the night. Get used to it. It's a phase in pregnancy. Go rest to your room. Leave your husband with me. Dad. I'll go ahead too. It's just a little pain. No need to panic. You're so weak-willed. You won't last in the police force. I don't understand what my daughter saw in you. Wanna know what happened to that couple? Who? The husband is cowling by the fridge, petrified. Scared of his wife as she approach him with a knife. Believe me. It is only then that I saw that kind of knife. Holy Fuck it's as long as a human arm. Hey.. Drink up, it's getting warm. What are you two planning? We're not staying long. Does your father know? What is it that he wants? He'll just ruin our lives. I'm worrying for Noel. Why would your father do that? He loves you. All of these are for you. He only thinks of himself. But he always gives you what you want, right? Mom, why don't you stop him? What can I do? Would he even listen to me? He might listen to you. But last night... We just did not understand each other. You know him when he's drunk. What ever it is that you're planning... Don't surprise your father. He'll be hurt. Especially now that he's waiting for your child. Are you sure that's all you're eating? This is fine. We're not sure what you feel. Why don't we consult a doctor? I'll just take some rest. Do you think we can go home tomorrow? Your mother seems fine now. Let's see. What do you mean? When I get better. It is now you who's sick. I don't know. Our plan's all ruined. What does she say? - Nothing. - What do you mean? Aren't you talking about it? We talk about it. But we're getting nowhere. Her fear of her father's on a different level. Everybody's scared. The mother. The helper. I don't know what I got myself into. I think even I am scared. Why are you scared? I don't know. Was it because he was police? Find a place of your own. It's hard living with in-laws. Remember my brother? John. Same issues. They moved to Los Baños. It's only then that they resolved their issues. It's easy to say. - Alright, Brother. Take it easy. - Thanks brother. Dude. What happened? - Can I stay here tonight? - Come in. Where's Mila? She's upstairs. But please ask the Mister first. He might get angry at me. - Where's he? - With the pigs. [Speaking in Ilocano] He's Ernie. Right. I remember him. You were the best man, right? - Yes. - What's up? I want to talk to Mila. So why do you need to tell me? She's your wife. And you're not a visitor here. Onyang told me to. [Speaking in Ilocano] Go ahead. I still have lots to do. I'll be quick. What happened to you last night? I feel like a fool knocking outside to no avail. Don't tell me you were asleep. The lights are on in your father's room when I arrived. When I knocked, he switched them off. Why is that? You know that we have a curfew here. Fuck, what is this? A police camp? I called, and nobody answered. - Sorry Noel. - Can't you even pick the goddamn phone up? - Dad have rules. - Is "Dad" all you can fucking say? - Noel. - Are you all chained to him? Do you need his approval on everything that you do? You're already married, Mila. - I'm your husband. - Calm down, Noel. They might hear you. Who will hear me? Your dad? Tell me! Tell me! Your dad? Dad?! Fuck this house! Let's move out, Mila. - It will be hard, Noel. - Why? - Dad wants us to live here. - What do you want? What if I disagree? What's wrong with living here? What's wrong? Look around. We're married but we can't do what we want. You're all chained here. You, your mom, and Onyang. I'll leave it up to you... ...if you want to get locked in here. Go waste your lives here. Dadong! Sit down. I'm still in-charge of this house. And what I want is for Mila to stay here. I can't force you if you do not want it here. - What is it that you argued with Mila? - It's nothing. She's just sulking. Is it about the two of you moving in here? No, it isn't. Probably just pregnancy woes. That's a bad start. It's less than a week that you got married. I'll take care of it. We're probably still just adjusting. Don't prolong it. Nothing will come out of this. Approach her first. I will. When will you return to work? This monday. Don't report in yet. What do you want? You meddle with everything that I do. You imbecile. Does a Noel Manalansan live here? - Yes, why? - Please give this to him. - What are these? - His clothes. What happened? It's nothing. Seems like your situation is getting worse. No, we're fine. Are you going to church? Later this afternoon. Tell this to the weak of heart... Be brave, and not be afraid. Here's your vengeful God ready to avenge you. He is ready to redeem you. So in that way... The blind's eye will open. The deaf's ears will open wide. The cripple will jump like the deer. And the mute will shout for joy. Noel! How's married life? Still trembling with excitement. Wait up. - Have you talked to Mila? - Not yet, why? - She called. - What about? She talked with Ms. Olivares. She asked for an extension for her leave. It's my second consultation with Dr. Trinidad. She said that the baby's shape's already formed. His head's formed and the body's 2.5 cm long. It's smaller than my fingers. The doctor also said that in the coming days... The baby's fingers will form. Three hundred. You should have given this to me instead. Your Ilocano-thriftiness is showing, Sarge. Well, you know him. His days are never complete without swindling anyone Who's swindling here? Who are you kidding? We all came from the same cut. Are there any cops without a side job? There's that straight cop, Capt. Reyes. Got promoted easily. Fool. He's sucking with the bureaucracy. Be like him if you want to get promoted. Is this clean? Of course, Sarge. Where is this from? Confiscated at Divisoria. Illegal possession. And the dude was also high. So I have him choose a case. What now, Sarge? Is it a deal? Hello. Good evening, Dad. Can I talk to Mila? - Noel. - Mila? Aren't you asleep? Yes, back at the clinic. - Why? What's wrong? - I can't take it anymore, Noel. - Help me escape. - How? Find a way. I'm coming with you. You sure about this? How about your father? - There's nothing-- - Mila? Mila? Is it Noel? Are you telling Dad? You're telling him? What will happen if I do that? Mom, I'm coming with Noel. Can't you help us? You can live here. Why do you have to leave? You know the reason why. What reason? It's Dad. I will never forgive him. What really happened? Mom, it's not my fault. He forced me to do it. Believe me. I never wanted any of it. And I don't want it to happen again. I don't know anymore what to think. Do you really want me to narrate in detail? You're also at fault. Why me? You left me to Dad. You're blaming me now? Don't you remember? I'm the only one who took care of you as a kid. We were always together. Always talking. I know everything that's happening to you. But why is it when you grow up You became more distant. As if I'm not here. You got closer to your father. I feel like a slave in my own house. Mom. You're jealous? You thought I love him? I'm more afraid of him than you are. I've never been happy in this house. Why are we like this? We live together in fear. How can you endure this? When you're not born yet... I tried to run from him. But nothing happened. I have nowhere to go. I can't do nothing. I went back to him. Since then, I followed him blindly. Do you also want me to be the same? Let's help each other. Let's escape. He can't stop you. You're not even married. He has nothing on you. Why don't you come with us? With Noel? It's not that easy. I've already decided. Don't worry. I won't tell your father your plans. Take care. Tuesday, December 15. Mom. Mom. Wait up. - Is Mila there? - Leave. - I'll just tell her you dropped by. - I need to speak with her. - Just make a call. - Mom. - I'm sorry I can't help you. - Mom. [ Conversing in Ilocano] Dad! Dad! Dad! - Dad! - Mila. - Take me to the hospital. - What's the matter? - Just take me. - Take me to the hospital. - Onyang! [Conversing in Ilocano] 100/70. You're fine. It's just normal. Maybe you're just excited. You're fine. Just continue taking your meds. Thanks! - Is something wrong? - Doc, a phone call. Just a sec. - Can I use your phone? - Go ahead. Phone's right there. - Noel? - Mila? Where are you? - Near the hospital. I escaped. I don't know what to do. Wait for me. Will be there in 30. Dad might find me here. Sir, please wait outside. Who was that?\ I don't know. Probably Mrs. Manalansan's husband. Then why isn't she here when I got back? I don't know. Onyang! [Conversing in Ilocano] The Lord is the truth. Those sinners betray the word of god. Because we were told to be humble... It is better for you to stay in the province. - Where to? - At my brother's in Los Baños. - What do you think? - Anywhere's fine. Domeng! Come out of there! - What's the matter? - Get your boss! - Who? - Noel! He's not here. I know he's there! Get him out! Noel! Bring out my daughter! [In Ilocano] It's embarrassing. We're such a hassle to you. Don't think of it. I told you, this place is ours. I'm sorry the place is too small. Don't be. We're thankful that we can run somewhere. Don't think of it. Cynthia and I also eloped. We know what you're going through. [In Ilocano] I apologize and please understand Dadong. He was just shocked. Mila is our only child after all. Our helper told us that he was shouting pointing his gun to her. He got angry at Mila. Perhaps too angry. Whatever it is that happened I'm apologize in behalf. Don't worry about it. Just tell him that it's better... ...that we talk about the children. Do you know where they are? No. Here's what we're going to do. We'll pay the deposit for the house. Then we'll ask for a recommendation from Ms. Olivares. We might find work here. How is she going to recommend us? We still have an outstanding loan. We're going to pay them soon. We will not run from them. It's embarrassing to you. If it's not for me, none of these would have happened. Don't be hard on yourself. You should blame... We should blame your father. Why is he like that? I don't know myself. I don't know what to say to you. Why's he mad at me? I'm nothing but honest with you. He's hard to comprehend.. You know that already. Was he hurting you? What happened to us is for the better. We can now live for ourselves. No one will meddle anymore. Why do things need to reach this point? Is it wrong for a father to worry for his child? - They are already married. - Mila's still my daughter. They want to live on their own. I admit my mistakes. This is all new to me. Imagine if it's you who has a sole daughter... ...you wouldn't also just give him to anyone. Maybe, I just don't know Noel enough. I understand. I know they might not understand me. But if they just place their feet on my shoes. Have you made your mind? We like it better here. More peaceful. How about your work? It would be a waste to just leave. We'll ask our manager for a recommendation. It would be easier for us that way. I don't know. But life here in Los Baños is hard. We only get by because my line is in Agriculture. I think we're lucky. We just found a place. It's small, but it's fine. Does he know where we are? I never said. I want to talk to you first. What do you want us to do? Why don't you go back to Manila first and talk to Mila's dad? He looks like he's sorry. It's up to you if you want to live here. Just talk to him first. We're going to be late. Mila. Go ahead. I'll be with you. You're just dreaming. A nightmare, perhaps? Maybe, there's a reason why people die. I once took Dad's gun from his room. Then, I face the mirror. Pointed the gun in my head. Just standing there. Why did you do that? There were times that I can't bear my loneliness. Why do you speak like that? You just got involved in my problems. It's better if we never got married. Dad never wanted me to get married, he only approved because I'm pregnant. Let's talk with him. Do you want us to be like this forever? Look at you. You're away, but you think of him. Let's put an end to this. Hail Mary full of Grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed are thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus. Holy Mary Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Saturday, December 19. - Good evening! - Good evening! - How are you? - Well... - The problem's fixed now? - Thank God. The kids? They're upstairs. Probably still ashamed of facing you. Christmas! It's christmas once again! May love reign us all. Christmas is here. Let us sing. Of beautiful songs. Because our Lord is full of love. When Christ was born. Three wise men went to visit. Each of them has brought special gifts. Let's lead a new life in the coming new year. For our land to be joyful. Please sit down. We're sorry for what happened. I'm the one who needs to apologize. Life is difficult without you, kids. Thanks. So, what's your plan? We're going to rent an apartment. It will be a waste. Why don't you just save the money? Live here... Accompany your father. That is the plan... ...while we're still looking for a place. When are you getting your things? Maybe later. You still have clothes to wear? We bought some. Please visit us from time to time. You won't forget us, would you? In christmas... - Let's have dinner at my home. - Sure! It's a good idea for us families to be together this Christmas. Thank you! For bringing back our children. When will you let me read it? When am I going to read your diary? There are things here that's just for me. That's the reason why. So, when? When, what? When can I read it? When I'm dead. Sunday, December 20. - Noel? - Dad? - Can I talk to Mila? Just a sec. Mila. Your dad. - Mila? - Dad? - Come here. Your mom's sick again. She's wants you. Can you drop by even for a moment? Dad, please. Leave us alone. What is it that you want from us? Come here. Right now. What does he want? He wants me to come. He said Mom's sick again. I thought we had an understanding? He's not going to leave us alone. Are you coming? Why are you even thinking of going? This needs to stop. Do you really need to go tonight? We won't be long. - You're eating dinner here? - We'll be back soon. - We'll be on our way. - Alright. Please don't leave. That's enough Mom. We can take care of ourselves. We talked about this already. - You don't understand me. - Everything's clear. You can't stop us no matter what. Your dad will not take this lightly. - He's out of his mind. - I've known for long! You don't understand. I want to help. But he's out of his mind. Mila. Noel. Listen to me. I'm begging you. Please don't leave. We've made up our minds. There's nothing you can do. Nothing will come out of this. Stay here for a while. He's not going to let you. I don't care anymore even if you rot with him in this house. Dad. We're leaving. I'm begging you, Mila. Don't leave. Don't leave me. Mila! I have a right to the child. Leave me alone! You don't have a right to my child. You don't!
