[lion growling] [music playing] Today, we'll be talking about the lion. On the edge of every lion territory, you'll find bachelor lions. Usually dirty, starving, and alone, these single lions lack the skills to survive. In many ways, they want the same things we all want. When you're alone in the wild, it's a struggle. They kill. They eat. And they have sex, lots of sex. And when these lonely, pathetic beasts bump into each other in the wild, they fight. But on rare occasions, the smart ones make a different choice. A deal is struck, a deal that will change their [ECHOING] lives forever. [music playing] Look at little jeep. You ready? Yeah. Come on. [whistles] [metal clanking] Tick tock, son. I hate it when you do that. Tick tock, Mark. You got to move. Where's your bag? Shit. Get it. Your tools are outside. That's a surefire way to get busted. I know. Let's go. What's it now? I got a new job. Where? You know that coffee shop I'm always at? They hired me. They gave me a... You know, a job. [chuckles] You're gonna be serving coffee? Maybe. I don't know. I guess. Like a waitress? If that's what you want to do. This is what I do. I never went to Yale. I can't throw a football, can't use a computer. But if you need a part for an Escalade, I can get it in... 30 seconds, I know. It's your thing, all right? You're good at it. But that's the thing. I need to find out what my thing is, you know? Yeah, obviously it's serving coffee. No, it's not serving coffee. I mean, everybody has some talent, right? You know what? I got some money. And I want you to have it. Dad, I'll be fine. - I want you to have the money. - I'll figure it out. You're gonna be a barista? [police sirens approaching] No, I'm not gonna... [tires screeching] Shit! Meet me around the back. [music playing] All right, you take off that way. Just keep running. What about you? Don't worry about me. Go. Go, go! [YELLING] There he goes, officer. He's getting away! Yeah, I'm the one that called you. I saw this suspicious guy. Stop right there there. Freeze! Right there! Come on, freeze. [music playing] Here you go. [phone ringing] Hello? Hey, son. They got me. I'm in jail. You ratted me out, dad. I didn't rat you out. It's called a diversion. You know what? I gotta go. [music playing] Wait, May. May, wait, hold up. May, can't we talk about this? There's nothing to talk about. You're not the kind of guy I'm looking for. That doesn't make any sense. I told you, it's over. You know what? I think this will be better for you than me. Lance Barber's Pool of Talent? What? May, are you serious right now? Hey, look, all right, I'm just... May, May... fine, I get it. You don't want to go out with me. Can you at least do me the courtesy and tell me why? You sit at that coffee shop every day, complaining about your life. But you don't do anything about it. You have no goals, no ambitions. You don't have one single thing that makes you even remotely interesting. You're nothing. Welcome back, dream catchers. I'm your host, Evelyn Ross. And I am so excited, because I will be going to the Hotel Angeleno and meeting with top Hollywood agent Lance Barber. Yeah? Lance, your guest just arrived. He's going to introduce me to some amazing young talent as they prepare for this Friday's hot new showcase. So be sure to tune in next week. And until then, don't quit your day dream. [music playing] Zane! Fan? Are you a fan or what? Yeah. Ladies and gentlemen, Evelyn Ross from Dream Catchers. Guys. Hi. Yeah, they're not... that's my game development team. I told them to get some sign. And then they brought their computers out to the pool. Have you thought about the story you're going to do? I've given it a lot of thought. Looks like there's no shortage of material. Yeah, welcome to my Pool of Talent. Everybody I sign stays here. And they collaborate on projects. They meet each other. And of course, under my expert tutelage, they blossom. And of course, Friday at the showcase, you'll help me make one of them a star. Cut the bullshit, Lance. Is there a star here or not? You mean besides me? It's always about you, isn't it? Hold on one second. Um, hey, Zane, Zane. Yeah? Do me a favor. Take this up to room 304. Sure. And take Miss Ross to her room, OK. It would be my pleasure. Just show her to the room. Don't tell her your life story. I got it, yeah. When I was 9, my mom just sort of left. Wow. Yeah, you know, I get Christmas cards from her and stuff. It's just like I forget what she looks like, you know? It's really sad. Yeah, super sad. This one's you. Oh. Right here. Nice. Yeah. Well, thank you for walking me up. Yeah, no problem. If you need me, I'm just downstairs in the underground penthouse thing. They are renovating my suite. Oh. So... Well, cool. Well, I know where to find you. Yeah, you know where to find me. All right, take care. Let me guess, you're an actress. I'm not an actress. I'm actually an entertainment reporter for Dream Catchers. Dream Catchers. Oh, that's cool. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Most of the people who stay here, they're... They're signed to Lance Barber. That's why I'm here. I am going to do a story on Lance Barber's Pool of Talent. Oh, cool, yeah, yeah, yeah. They're having this party downstairs, like, this, like, networking thing. If you want, I could, like, come... you know, I could show you around, or I'd take you. Well, I was sort of already planning on going. So I will be down there. Maybe I'll see you there. Cool. I just got to run this to a model. OK. I'll just be running around. You have fun with the models. Cool. [hums] [knocks] MYA CASSEL: [FROM BEHIND DOOR] What's up? Yeah, I'm coming. Yeah, so I'll just meet you down by the pool later. - Hey, Mya. - Hey. Got your script for you. My script is here. I got to go. - Come on. - OK. I've been waiting for this moment. Yeah. You know how I feel about you. Everyone knows how I feel about you. Let's stop pretending. Stop pretending. Oh, you know I'm just acting, right? Yeah. Yeah, I know that. Ew! Oh, shit. Get out! Oh, so unprofessional. Are you alone? Do you find yourself wishing you had support, friends, family, anyone who really cared about you at all? No. It's a sad sight. Perhaps you're a bachelor lion, hmm? [music playing] Hey, Evelyn. Oh, hey Zane. Are you going to the elevator? Yeah, I was I was planning on it. Yeah, I got you. I'll walk you down. So let me guess, you are a writer? No. Struggling actor? No, I'm a struggling handyman. OK. What else do you do? I like to dance. I'm a huge gamer, level 80 Wizard on Wizard World. Actually, I meant... Hey, asshole, how many times have I told you not to fuck with my equipment, huh? I love animals. Hey, you're lucky you're with your lady friend, or else I'd put both of my paws in your grill, fool. What is his deal? No, it's my buddy Jimbo. Hey, guy. Hey, Jimbo. The next time you fuck with my equipment, I'm gonna wheelbarrow your ass and break both of your arms. OK. Don't fuck with my equipment. OK. Fucker! Wow. Sorry. He's kind of a dick. Yeah, total asshole. Yeah. By the way, my mom left us too, growing up. [elevator dings] [man yelling] Yeah, get your hands up. Everybody's hands up. Yeah, it's, like, always like this. Quite the party. Hi. I'm ready for an interview anytime. - Hi. - Hi. Hi. It's so nice to meet you. You can dance? Can we dance for you? Hold on just a second. Shoot, I'm gonna have to take this. But I'll talk to you guys in a little bit. Just a second. Hello? I can have that to you in about an hour, maybe. No, I won't fuck it up. I promise. Sounds good. Fuck what up? Oh, I had a little bit of bad luck on my last piece. My boss is sort of a hard ass. Yeah. I have to pick one of these assholes. Do you want to hear something silly? I'm a little intimidated by the people here. Well, you shouldn't be. I deal with people like this all the time. This isn't special. This is 15 minutes of fame. And you have nothing to worry about anyway. Thank you. Oh, there's Lance. I gotta go talk to him. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. You going to be OK? Yes, yeah. I'm just kidding. I'm not really intimidated by the people. - I'm good. - OK. Yes, I'm good. That's what I was looking for. Yeah. Hi, there you are. Hi. I need you to be useful as well as ornamental, my dear. I'm gonna introduce you to some of my talent. I just want you to meet everybody. [music playing] [lion growling] Hey. Is something broken? Hi, how are you? Do you mind if I hang out? This is a networking party for the talent. Yeah, that's what I wanted to talk to you about. OK. Really? Don't talk to anybody else. Lance, I want you to see something. Leonard, in a bit, in a bit, in a bit. Sit. Yeah. What can I do for you? Do you mind if I get one of those. Yeah, but don't touch the IPAs. They're for the guests. Yeah. OK, make it quick. I want you to represent me. Represent you? Yeah. You're the fucking janitor. What am I supposed to do, put you and your brushes on America's Got Toilets? Lance, I know I'm talented, man. I just don't... like, I don't know what it is yet. That's adorable, but I'm not your mother. I represent stars. That's how I make a living. Can I show you something? See that guy right there? That's Banana Peel Boy. He's got over 20 million hits on YouTube. He's going to be on Kimmel tonight. Unless you have a talent I can monetize, I can't help you. Have another beer. Guys, make sure you get a card. [laughter] That's uh... that's funny. How are you guys? Great. I just booked a beer commercial. Wow. I'm working on an album with Jay-Z. What do you do? Is Lance your agent? I'm not his agent. He's the janitor. Well, I mean, I'm not just the janitor. I do more than... I'm not just a janitor. Yo, who's the asshole? That's Lance barber. He's a talent agent. My boy, did your own agent just cock block you? Not his agent. He's the janitor. I'm the fucking janitor around here, man. How'd you get in this party? I'm mingling, bro. I work here. I can go wherever the fuck I want to go. Yo, calm down, dude. Calm down, all right? I'm just making conversation. Jesus. Shit, dude. I'm sorry. Just, like, I know I can do what they're doing. And I know I'm talented, you know? Like... you know, dude, I got an idea. Hmm? Why don't I say, like, I'm an actor, and you're like a writer? A writer? Like films and stuff? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And you're a writer. And like, you just cast me in this new movie that you're shooting. All right. - It's dope, dude. - What's it called? I don't know. You're the writer. [fake laughs] That's great. That's a great character. It gives me a lot to play with. Yeah. What do you do? I'm an actor. Oh, I write stuff, yeah. He's a writer. He just cast me in this new movie that he wrote. I did, yeah. Huge. Great part, great part. So you're the director? Yes. No. Yes. Yes, this one, I'm... I'm gonna direct. As well... Because... He writes, he directs. The other ones we've done before, I didn't direct, because I didn't want to do it. So I wanted to focus on the... - Right. - I'm not... Huge. We can probably get you a part. - Yeah. - What was your name again? I directed one as well. No, we should... you should. I'm also a producer. I do production as well. Dude, really? Come on. How am I supposed to know... How am I supposed to know that I want to direct too? Dude, every writer wants to... You can't just keep making these... direct, dude. Are you guys straight? Straight? Do you suck dick? Yes, oh, yeah. No, no, we don't. No, we're straight, yeah. Yeah. Yes, we're straight. Well, how about a little menage? Nicki Minaj? A three-way? - Yeah. - Yeah, no... He knows. He knows what you mean. For sure, that's easy. Yeah, you want to do that now? Yeah, right now. Yeah? Cool. Yeah, let's see. That was easy. Ew, dude, what a slut? Yeah, well, guess what that slut just offered to have sex with us. So come on. No, what? Fuck no, dude. Are you kidding me? That's... like, at the same time? It's called a three way, one, two, three. Let's go. Dude, I don't even know you, bro. Well, it's a good think you're not fucking me, huh. You're fucking her. I don't know her either. Hey, one sec. Like, what are the ground rules? There's no, like, manual for this kind of thing, OK? Just get in there and do it, all right? Ever seen a porn? Pretty much like that. No, bro, gross. Like, I don't want your balls slapping my knees or something. That's not how it... ew. Like touching each other and stuff. Fine, fine, fair enough, fine. How about this? I go low, you go high. That seems pretty fair. All right, but don't look at me, you know? Obviously, no eye contact. Oh, yo, one more thing. I swear to god. What? I have a hooded wagon. You have a what? I'm not circumcised. I don't want to freak out or get caught off guard. I actually appreciate you telling me that. Thank you. Yeah. [music playing] Over here. What are you doing? Take your pants off. Yeah, sure. [moans suggestively] Don't grab me. Oh, god. Oh, yeah. What is she doing? Oh, yes! I don't know. I guess she's starting without us. Is that normal? How am I supposed to know. I thought you said you did this before. [knocking on door] Hey, Charlotte, you in there? What the fuck! - Oh, shit! - I didn't... You're fucking my girlfriend? Yeah, like you fucked that voiceover actress. I told you, I didn't fuck her. I'm going to beat you. Just listen... Hey, don't you see what's going on here, dude? We were lured in here, OK, by this... This attractive young lady for no other reason than to make you jealous, hey? Now, I for one, am appalled by this behavior. So if you don't mind, you're standing on my pants. Thank you. You're welcome. You all right? This is so humiliating. I have to live here. Thanks for taking the punch, man. You didn't have to do that. Yeah. All right, well, I guess I'll see you around, man. Mark? Yeah? You have a job? I got fired this morning. Do you have a girlfriend, family, you know, a brother or sister? No. Parents? My dad's in prison. Why? I want you to see something. ALFRED BROWNBERRY: Usually dirty, starving, and alone, these single lions lack the skills to survive. But when these lonely, pathetic beasts bump into each other in the wild, they fight. But on rare occasions, the smart ones make a different choice A deal is struck, a deal that will change their lives forever. What do you think? What do I think about what? You and I, bachelor lions, helping each other? How could I possibly help you? I'm thinking you move in. You know, I don't have all the details worked out. But it just feels right. What does? What feels right, man? That if you have a friend that you can rely on and you could trust, that everything else will just follow. Yeah, I don't know. Mark, why not? Why not? I don't know? Because it's weird, man. I barely know you. That's the point. It's like we're two dudes who can start fresh, you know? There's no bad blood. Yeah, thanks, man. But you know what? I work better alone. Yeah, I can see you're really killing it. You know, whatever, man. It's fine. It's a dumb idea anyways. See you around. [elevator dings] You OK? Uh, yeah, just trying to think of something. Sometimes it helps to think out loud. OK. My new friend who I just met asked me to move in. It's a big step in a relationship. Oh, no, it's not that type of relationship. It's a guy. Then what's the big deal? I don't know. He thinks we can help each other out and stuff. How so? Just in general, I guess, you know, get our shit together. So you don't have your shit together? No, not exactly. OK, I'm ready. Are you interviewing with him too. No, we were just talking. I think you should move in with him. What have you got to lose, right? [music playing] SINGER: [SINGING] Try and try and try to be elusive. Why, oh, why... [electronic beeping] Dude, what the shit? Shit! You scared me. I scared you? Man, what are you doing? I'm sorry. Get out. I'm stealing this car. Dude, I live in this car, OK? Really? That's pretty sad, man? Could you, like, steal another car? I could. But my guy wants this one. So just get out. The keys are in my pocket. Oh, I don't need the keys. These cars are a cinch. You just got to pop the ignition. Piece of cake. How'd you do that so quick? I know, it's a gift. Well, now you should really get out. Can I at least have my wallet. It's in the glove compartment. Dude, come on. Two bucks? Yeah. Keep it. Just get out. Yeah, going. Hurry up. I don't have all day. [tires screeching] [music playing] ALFRED BROWNBERRY: When you're alone in the wild, sometimes you simply run out of choices. A decision must be made. Your survival depends on it. [knocking] Hey. What's up, bro? Well, dude, I... You know, I thought about it. And I'm in. Thought about what? I mean, you know, your idea, dude, bachelor lions, living together, that whole thing. Dude, I was just, like, spit-balling, you know? Oh, yeah. All right, cool, all right. Mark, I'm just kidding, man. Get in here. Just put your stuff, you know, wherever. Just in here, jamming. [plays drums badly] Yo, you want a beer? Yeah. You're not allowed to spin it. You can spin it all you want. No you do not. - Well... - It's illegal. It's not illegal. Watch me spin it. All right. Let's go, my turn. Dude, stop, dude. Yo, this is my game. Yeah? Well, why you lose at it so much, huh? Boom! That's how you do it. Woo! Touchdown, baby. That's my boy. Bro, you get to play this all the time, right? I just got here. Fuck, you know what? Fuck off. Boom, beat your level. What the fuck? [music playing] [engine revving] Grandma, hi. Hey. What's up? Hey, hand me that pot up there. That's a pan. Give me the pot next to it. There you go. Thank you. So I don't have any money for you. Grandma, I do not want your money. Thank you, though. Came to come check up on you. You going to spend the night? I made up the guest room for you. No, I can't stay. I got work early. And I got a new roommate. Hey, have you heard from mom? No, she won't call me. She owes me money. Well I'm just worried about her. Honey, can you go to the store for me? Go get you cigarettes? Please. Yes. I love you Love you. [music playing] Yo. Wow, finally out of fucking bed, dude. You need a hand or something? Yeah, I could use your help. Come on. Thanks. That's nice. Grab a can. Do you know who Vincent van Gogh is? Yeah, the painter. Right. So he's like the greatest painter of all time, right? Van Gogh died thinking that he totally sucked, because he didn't have anybody to tell him how great he was. So you know, he needed a friend, yeah? Yeah, Mark, but to make this work, dude, we need a total commitment. We need to hang out all the time. Sure. We help each other get jobs. No, careers. And we help each other get girls, tons of girls. And Mark, we always, always have each other's backs. Yeah, dude, I got it. All right, put your number in my phone. OK. Boom. All, right now we're GPS buddies. You know where I am. And I always know where you are. Hi, Dream Catchers. I'm Evelyn Ross. And today I'm here with Mya Cassell. Hi, Mya. Thank you for joining us. Thank you for having me. I understand that you are participating in some groundbreaking training. I've actually been doing ratchet training. Is there anything that you're working on that you could share with us? So it would go something like, girl, who did you hair, because I need to know so I will never go there, OK? That was a read, honey. I like it. It's very practical. I feel like I could use that in my everyday life. 'Sup, Cheryl? Zane. Thank you. Hey, what's up, ladies? What up? What the hell was that? Am I invisible or something? Hell yeah, bro. Girls are interested in the pool guy or the guy with the pool guy. Wow, OK. We need to change that right away. Yeah, bro, we got a lot to do. First, though, I got to find my car. Your car? Yeah, somebody stole my car. Shit, dude, did you call the cops? No, dude. They won't do anything about it. I got to find it myself. Sounds dangerous. Maybe. I'm in. Yeah? Yeah, man. We're brothers. But after that, you gotta do something that I choose. Done. Bachelor lions swear. Yeah, dude. [whistling] Asshole! The pool looks a little dingy. Yeah, Jimbo, I just got to put chlorine in it. I'm about to take a swim. Do it now, dickhead. Shit. Who the fuck is that. That's Jimbo, man. He fucks with everybody. I'll be right back. Wait, wait. Come on. Where are you going? ALFRED BROWNBERRY: When taking over a new territory, the first step is to establish dominance. Vanquish your rivals. In other words, someone is going to get pummeled. Yo. Who the fuck are you? Come here! What the fuck? Come here. Come back. [lion roaring] Get him. Get him, bro. [grunting] You're done, motherfucker. Oh, shit. You remember, next time you mess with Zane, you mess with me too. That's right, dickhead. [lion growling] Motherfuckers. Mark, where are we going? We're going to the police station, man. Just go straight. Myers, through the door, please. It's really cold in here. Who the hell is this? It's my buddy Zane. What's up? Get out of here. This doesn't concern you. I changed my mind. About what? You said you got some money, right? $20,000. Well, I lost my job. I need it. You still have that car? Why? Well, it's in the car. Of course it is. The car was stolen. What? Last night. Some guy broke in and stole the car, fucking real professional too. That must be one of Maurice's guys. Your car's at the chop shop. - You know where that is. - What's it matter, man. You know if the car's at the chop shop, - the money's already gone. - Hid it in the spare tire. They won't find it. It's all yours. You mean ours. No, Mark. I'm going to be going away for a long time. You're gonna be on your own, son. Listen, you know what? I'm really sorry I haven't been a better father to you. I'm sorry for all those times I yelled at you and told you you were worthless. Sorry for urinating on you. OK, that was an accident. No, it wasn't. You know the other night, we were talking, and you said, some people just have to find the talent, you know, something special about them? Yeah. I've given that a lot of thought. Some people are just nothing. That's it. They're just nothing, son. You know, they're just average Joes. They're going to spend their life pushing a broom around. And that's fine. You're talking about me. I'm just saying, maybe you won't find that special thing about you. Everybody has something. You think these guys in here are some kind of special secret geniuses? No, trust me, they're worthless. You know what? I bet you that half these guys wouldn't even be here if they actually had somebody who fucking believed in them. [music playing] What if he's right, man? What if we're just two guys with nothing special? He's wrong, Mark. I'm not smart, Zane. You know, sometimes I go downtown and just sit down at lunch and listen to all the businesspeople talking about stuff. And dude, I have no idea what they're saying. They're businesspeople. They make stuff up to sound smart. Yeah, I guess. My dad, man, he's just always been disappointed in me. One time in the fifth grade, I got beat up by a girl. Well, you know, like a big, strong girl. My dad just shook his head and walked away. In high school I got beat up by the tambourine player. I don't think I can help you, man. I'm telling you, dude, I got a temper, all right? I'm moody. I can't keep friends. I'm too clean. I snore. I know. All right. What are we going to do? I don't know, but whatever it is, we're going to do it together. Tambourine player? Yeah, tambourine player. Damn. Sorry about that. Yeah, it was pretty bad. Take it easy on this ride back, man. My nuts are killing me. [music playing] Thanks so much. [music playing] [singing in spanish] Dude, these are so good. You got to try these. Yo, I've been meaning to tell you something. What? My dad, he left me some money. How much money? $20,000. Yeah, right. Bro, your dad left you $20,000? Yeah. What's wrong, man? I'm thinking, man, what we could do with all that money. Dude, you and I, we'll spend it together. No. Mark are you serious? Bachelor lion swear. Yo, bachelor lion swear. What? Mark, are you fucking... $20,000? Dude come here. Look over there. Those girls are totally checking us out. New bachelor lion rule, we never pass up hot chicks. Make a move. All right. Watch this. Hey excuse, me, ladies, I just wanted to say hi. I'm Mark. This is my boy Zane. What up? Check it out. We're about to go down this alley to go steal his car back. You want to know why? Because we're badasses. OK, I think it's time to go. Nice to meet you guys. You girls should stay here, because it's about to get dangerous. Zane. Yeah. All right, take this. You bring your beanie? No, I didn't bring a beanie. You didn't tell me to bring a beanie. Come on. Yo, so how dangerous are these guys? I don't know. Like compared to what? Like an alligator, skydiving. Yo, I actually hear that skydiving's, like, super safe. So they're more dangerous than an alligator and less dangerous than skydiving? Yeah, something that. Yo, all right. Here's the chop shop. Come on. Hey come on, run. Hey, yo, give me the bolt cutters. Here. Just give me the bag. OK. All right. [chain rattling] [music playing] Shh, come on. Yeah, there it is. Come on. Yes. Yo, are you living in this car? Yeah, so what? So when they stole it, you didn't have a choice. You had to come live with me. Yeah, man, but you know, I also believe in what you're doing, all right. [police sirens approaching] Right, right, yeah, what we're doing. That's what I said. [crashing] Shit! Dude, get down, get down. Leave the car. Let's get out of here. Thief, show me some hands! [gunshots] Mark, get us out of here, dude. [tires screeching] Mark, go let, go left. Turn left! We're the threat, motherfuckers! Woo! Shit! Oh, yes. What the fuck? So where is it? He said it was in the spare tire. Wow, man. Oh, man. Oh, my god. Mark, are you serious? [music playing] SINGER: [SINGING] I know what we do is not right. But we gotta make it to the top, right? I cannot promise you I will not fight. So until they catch me at the top, like... Everybody has something. The problem is, people don't spend enough time trying to figure out what it is, you know? I think that's what I want to do. I want to find out what my talent is. When it's my turn, you promised, remember? Yeah, OK. So what do you think your talent is? I don't know. What about you? Don't laugh, OK? Mm-hmm. I hear beats in my head. Like, no matter what I'm doing, I'm just kind of putting a beat to it. Dude, that's dope. Have you ever laid down a beat before? No. We should do that tomorrow and put it on the internet. See if it gets a bunch of hits. Yeah, OK, cool. We'll go see my friend Henderson. He's a guru. Wait, what's a guru? [music playing] The lions will seek out older, more experienced lions. They must choose wisely. [music playing] Excellent, yes. Now what? Yes, good placement. Ah, yeah, yeah. Yes, nice touch. Hmm, no, no, no, that's too much. No, not too much. Don't ever question a sushi master. Don't do it. [kettle whistling] The sushi master is very unhappy with you. Zane. Henderson. What's up, buddy? How are you? I'm doing well. This is my friend Mark. Hey, Mark. You guys hungry? Want to grab a table or something? Man, always. But we have something to talk to you about. All right. An idea that we have. Oh, I like ideas. You know what? That's my delivery truck. Help me unload. I want to hear your idea. I was telling my friend that you knew a long time ago that you wanted to be a sushi chef. Thanks, Jamie. That's right. I had a vision. I saw my entire future in my head. I was at a baseball game at Dodger Stadium. Hideo Nomu was pitching. And they were giving out free sushi, right? There was something about that seaweed wrapped in raw tuna that just blew my mind. Later that evening when I was sitting on the toilet, I had this image in my head. It was of me becoming a sushi master. See, Mark and I want to find our talent. Now the search begins right here, OK? But then you got to... You got to branch out. You got to step out of your comfort zone. If you want, maybe I can get you some free classes at the art school. I still know a guy there. Yeah, man. That's a great place for us to start. The art school? Yeah. I'll call him right now. Henderson, thank you. Yeah, thanks, man. Good seeing you. All right. Take care. Don't be a stranger. MAURICE: David, David, I gave you $20K, and you didn't deliver the car. And your sun, he broke into my place. Wrecked the place, took his car back. He did? Oh, yeah. You sure it was Mark? Yeah. Oh, yeah, it was your son. Who's watching the place anyway? How'd that kid... how'd that kid get the car? MAURICE: You should see what the place looks like, like a fucking wrecking ball, he did. I'll tell you something, David. I'm going to kill your son. Whoa, Maurice. Settle down, man. MAURICE: Do you understand that? That's my son. I'll get you the car back. I'm going to kill your son. Do you know where the fuck I am right now? What are you looking at? Fuck you, David. [music playing] Hi. Hey. Can I help you? We're here to see James. Are you students here? Not yet. We're going to be. Oh, what's your major? Major? What are you studying? Oh, we don't know yet. Come on, I'll help you find James. OK, you guys can take a seat on the couch. Follow me. OK. [music playing] Hey. Yeah. Thank you, mon cherie. My friend Henderson told us to come see you. You mean the sushi master? Yes. Yeah, he told me that you two would come searching for me. He also told me that you'd like to embark on a journey together. I once embarked on a journey with someone I trusted. Is this guy for real? This is the real deal, bro. This guy is... Shh. Sit here. What? [slam] [music playing] Before we begin, I want to share with you boys the immortal words of Howard Klein. Close your eyes. [holding musical note] Close your eyes, please. Just close your eyes. Close your eyes. [holding musical note] Now I want you to remove your cloak, as if doing so is removing your inhibitions. Your shirts will be fine. Dude, what are you doing? No, we just need to skip that part. [clears throat] [holding musical note] I want you to see a door. Turn the doorknob. Open the door. And walk through it into freedom, bright light, and complete acceptance. How long is this going to take for us to find our talent? It could take months, maybe years. Years? Wait, wait, hold on a second. You're sure there's not something we can find in like, I don't know, a week? All right, you know what? You boys, you're not ready for this. No, we're ready. No, you're not ready for this. - No, I promise, we're ready. - You're not ready for this. Mark. You're like little babies. Babies? Babies. And you've tasted the breast milk. And you like the breast milk. But you don't know where the breast milk comes from. So unless the breast is literally put into your mouth, - you're not going to get fed. - Mark. I don't even know what that means. - Mark, damn! - Well, what does that mean? It means... about... you put the breast milk in your mouth. What it means is that I've set you up for some classes. And when those classes are done, you can come back. And we'll try again. [singing bowl rings] Namaste. Huh? It's get out of my office. No problem. [music playing] Wow. [music playing] We should go in this class. Yeah. Excuse me, gentlemen. Are you in this class? Exactly. Please remove yourself now. [music playing] Five and six and eight. One, two, three, and four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, and three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Hey, that's Barbara. Who? You know, the girl that ignored you by the pool. Five, six, seven eight. One, two... Wow, these guys are really good. She's waving at me. I know. Yeah. Hey, Zane. Yeah, hi. What are you guys doing here? We're students here. Really? What are you guys taking? Painting. Theater. Lots of stuff. Lots of stuff, classes. Well, I'll see you guys later at the hotel? Yeah. Awesome, bye. Bye. Dude, I think James is right, man. We have no idea what we're doing. I know, man. We've got to start exploring. You know what? I know exactly where to start. Come on. [music playing] Hey, we're looking for Melvin. Yeah, he's waiting for you. Cool. [music playing] Oh, come in, young brother. Hey, what's up, man? How you been, man? Brother, how you doing? Hey, hold up. Who the fuck is this? Yo, he's cool man. It's my boy Zane. All right, man. Have a seat right there. Hey, how's your pops? Looks like he's... he's going away for a long time. Damn, can't say that I'm surprised, man. Hey, did I ever tell you about that time that we stole the school bus? A school bus? Yeah, we didn't know it had kids on it. And it was all fucked up. Anyway, man, what can I help you with? Ah, so here's the thing. I keep hearing these beats in my head. Just like, you know, [beat boxes].. And I was hoping you would help me turn them into like a track or something. Yeah, it's like a rap track. Yeah. What do you play? Well, I don't actually, you know, play any instruments. So what am I recording? You're just going to, like, record what Mark hears in his head. And you're going to lay it down, you know? Do y'all have any money? Yeah, we have money. Yeah, dude. All right, because I'm agnostic. My faith is a little shattered. So you're going to have to show me. Dude, we got. What is it, probably, like, $10, $12 grand. OK, my man. Get in the booths. Let's make magic happen, baby. All right, young blood. Let's hear it. Yeah, Mark, just like... Just let him hear what you hear in your head, you know? All right, I know this one I keep hearing. It's kind of cool. It's kind of like... it goes like, [beat boxes] All right. OK. [beat boxes] This is dope, bro. I mean, you know how to, like, warp it or something down there? Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's dope, dude. Dude, exactly. You know, then take it down to like hold. And bump, bump. Dude, hold that one out. Yeah, just like that. Yes! [beat playing] Lance? Hey, got a minute? No, I've got a show in two days. And I got four clients about to walk off a feature. What do you want? I really need to talk to you. You want a cup of coffee? I would love some coffee. Cream, sugar, roofies? I just spoke to my producer. And I ran all of my ideas past her. I talked about all of the people that you've introduced me to and all of the storylines that I've come up with. And she hates all of it. I'm serious. She says it's a bunch of vapid kids that are trying to get famous. OK, Evelyn, a bunch of vapid kids trying to be famous as a show I could sell tomorrow. These kids are not vapid. They work very hard. She's an Instagram star that takes pictures of her butt for a living. Yeah, she works three minutes a week. And she makes $4 million a year. You see these two girls? You know what they were doing last night? ' They started in Justin's new video. They moved here a week ago, and now they're hot. Well, good for them. Good for them. We've heard this story before. My producer needs something that's unusual. This was never about these kids trying to get famous. This story is about me making them famous. I've got millions of eyes. I can make or break any of these discovery clients of yours. But what I don't have is a story right now. So maybe you could work with me, because I would like to make this all OK. You promised me a story. And more importantly, you promised not to waste my time. Maybe there's an angle I missed. I just don't have my story yet. ALFRED BROWNBERRY: Inevitably, young bachelor lions challenge each other in dangerous and risky duels. [engines revving] [music playing] All right, let's go. ALFRED BROWNBERRY: These battles are a necessary test of wills. Eventually, one of the lions emerges victorious. The other is clearly the loser. What the heck was that? Oh, come on, dude. It's what guys do. What a day, man. Mark. Yo, that beat was sick. So sick. I had no idea I could do that. Yeah, man, I've just got a couple of things I got to do. So I'll catch you up the stairs. No, dude, I'll give you a hand. Really? Hey, Zane, hi. Hey. What's up, Barbara? How was class, you guys? Great. Yeah. You were awesome in that dance thing earlier. Oh, thanks. Yeah, we saw a naked lady today. You guys want to sit with us? You can sit right there. Yeah. Oh, there's beers in the cooler too. Yeah, dope, we love a good beer. You guys are students in the art school? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Hmm. ALFRED BROWNBERRY: When the females accept you into the pride, it's a triumph for any lion. Well done, young bachelor, well done. [music playing] [SINGING] Oh, oh. You guys should come to the show on Friday. Yeah, but isn't that for, like, artists? Well, you guys are enrolled in art school. Oh, yeah. True. You know, this whole time I thought you were the pool guy. Pool guy. [SINGING] Always winding, road. But I'll be with you along it, I know. This mile leads to lots of places. But I'll forever find yours out of all these faces. [music playing] SINGER: [SINGING] It won't be easy now. It won't make any sense. Don't let it keep passing you by. You'll find your way somehow, out of the emptiness. You're not a comet in the sky. And when your fears come crashing down, down, your in the everlasting now, now. Who's that? This girl that I met. I can't stop thinking about her. Oh. She's amazing. Hey, Zane, dance class auditions are happening right now you. Want to come join? Yeah, that would be cool. Awesome. Huh, Mark? No, I'm OK. You guys go ahead. Remember what Henderson said. We got to step outside of our comfort zone. All right, let's go. Come on. It'll be fun. Let's do it. All right, guys. Let's do it. Mark and Zane, this is a new combo. It's a little bit tough. But just hop in line here. And we'll see what we can do. Is everybody ready? OK, great. Let's go. Five, six, seven, eight. Go one and two, three and four, five, six, seven, hit eight. One, two, three, four, five, and six, seven, eight. Chug, chug, two, three, four, turn five, and six, seven, eight. Swoop one. Good. Snap it. What is the second? Zane. Yeah? Hey, yeah, good job, OK, all right. - That was good. - That was pretty good. Yeah, yeah. OK, guys, let's do it again. Full... full out, OK? Playback. Did you want me to do it? Not this time. Just then, OK? Sorry. [music playing] A little more rehearsal time or something. Maybe we should talk about some other classes. That was good. You really hit that last part. But I feel like we should... I just feel like... come on. No, it's cool. It's like that whole little bit of... Zane. Like that... what's that? Like, this thing is kind of fun. I've never taken an acting class in my life, first of all. I've always felt that my talent is... It's organic. It's a gift, right? It would be corrupted by any sort of professional sort of training or whatever. So for instance, like, I see that you're looking at my stubble. So I might lean in. And then I'd be like, would you like to lick my stubble? Oh, god, I'm going to have to pass, Carl. No, no, no, no. It's not Carl. That's... I'm in character. But you see what I'm saying? I'm like focused in character. You didn't even know. This happens to my co-stars all the time. I am really impressed, Carl. You didn't know. That was fantastic. Cool, good. You should be. I mean, so am I, frankly. Where's your Oscar? That's what I want to know. Right, right, it's over there by my drink by the pool. Why don't you come by and get me one or share one? I'll see you around. Looking good, red. Thank you. Jesus. Would you just hang here a second? I'll be right back. Where you going? Chick just waved to me. I'm going to go say hi. Her name's Evelyn, dude. And she's waving at me. Hey, guys. What you doing? Just chilling. Just got back from class. Nice, well, you have a drink with me? Awesome, thanks. Here, I'll get these. Thank you. So what, you guys, like, know each other? Oh, Ev and I? Yeah, we go way back, huh? Ev, that's funny. You want hear something hilarious? What's up? I think I'm screwed. How come? Yeah, how come? Well, you know how I said my producer was sort of a hard ass? I sort of fucked up my last story. And I kind of need a story really bad. I need a good one. Hey, come here. Look, don't worry about it, OK? Zane and I will help you out in any way we can, all right? ALFRED BROWNBERRY: There comes a time when the bachelor lion's bond will be tested. In different circumstances, this image would cause an immediate attack. Steady, deep breaths, young lion. Mark, can I talk to you for a second? Um, hey, would you just hang on a sec? Yeah. I'll be right back. Dude, what's up? Why do you have to be so charming, Mark? What? Batting your puppy dog eyes at Evelyn, dude? Dude, I'm just trying to help her. No, you're not. You're rubbing her hand like you're trying to get a fucking genie out of it. Calm, down, all right? I really like her, Mark, like a lot, bro. The minute that I met her, I knew we were meant to be together. Have you ever felt that before? Yeah. OK, well, that's what I feel with Evelyn, bro. I feel sparks. Sparks? Yes, dude, like a deep connection. I hate to break it to you, bro. But you might have felt a little more than she did. What's that supposed to mean? I'm just saying, the other night, you know when - we almost got our asses kicked? - Yeah. I ran into her by the elevator. And dude, she was all over me. Did you get her number? No, but... Well, eh! Doesn't count, bro. If you didn't get her number, it doesn't count. OK, well, did you get her number? No, but I know her room number, because I live here. Guess what, so do I. Oh, that could change really quickly, bro. ALFRED BROWNBERRY: Well, well, well. Lions fighting over a female. Didn't see that coming. Do you believe in what we're doing, Mark? Like this is the most important thing to me, bro. Dude, yeah. And it's actually working, all right? So let's not screw it up. I know. All right, well, there's only one solution. We have the both drop Evelyn. Just drop her? Yes, that's it. Like, we can be nice to her, because I don't want to hurt her feelings. But that's as far as it goes. So you're willing to just completely let her go? Yeah, as long as you're going to do the same. Yeah, sure. Bachelor lion swear. Come on, dude. I'm in this with you, 100%. All right. Shit, she's been watching us the whole time, hasn't she? Yeah. What do we do? We should just walk away. Just walk away? Yeah, just walk away. What... god, that is so awkward. [grunting] Hey. Oh, hey. What happened out there? Oh, nothing. Yeah, we just needed to talk is all. Well, you forced me to drink an entire pitcher of margaritas by myself. Sorry about that. OK. I was wondering if I could ask you a favor. Yeah. Yeah, what's up? Well, I was hoping I could maybe ask you to come over to my place for dinner and I could run a few ideas past you. Um... What's wrong? Oh, nothing. Yeah, just... just ideas and stuff? Ideas. Sure, yeah. I have to warn you, I am a pretty terrible cook. All right. You have been warned. ALFRED BROWNBERRY: Hmm, looks like it's mating season. [bell rings] Shit. Hey. I thought you weren't coming. Yeah, well. Yeah, sure. You want a beer? Yes, please. So you moved in with Zane, right? Yeah. Have you managed to get your shit together yet? Working on it. Well, I think it's great what you're doing. I'm sure it's really great for Zane. You know, it's actually really good for both of us. We're both helping each other out, yeah. Well, I love it. I think you guys are totally different. Are we? Absolutely. I mean, everybody else that lives here, they all want something, you know? They want me to do a piece on them. Yeah, we kind of just... I don't know. Just figuring it out. In fact, Zane, he got us into these art classes. And I laid down my first music beat, which is pretty cool. Amazing. You should let me hear it sometime. It sounds like you guys are really close. I'm sorry for staring, but you are even more attractive in person than on your show. I've seen it. That's embarrassing. I'm glad... I'm glad you think so, because you're going to spend the night here tonight. I can't. What? Really, I can't do that. Wait, you're serious? Yeah, I am actually being serious. This doesn't do anything for you? It's not that, trust me. Oh, my god. I just realized that you and Zane are gay. What? No, we're not gay. We're bachelor lions, OK? What? I'm sorry. It's what Zane calls it. But it's when you... You're going into this type of relationship with someone where you just help each other out with everything. But you still sleep together, right? No. Well, then what's the ultimate goal? To help each other find, like, our one true talents. Wow, bachelor lions. Yeah. I like it. ALFRED BROWNBERRY: Sooner or later, one of the lions gives into primal urges. The bond is broken. What happens next? Anger, betrayal, and violence. SINGER: [SINGING] We were invincible. We could never die. And all the world could rise against us. And we'd dare to fight. [music playing] Catch myself before I fall. See through all the reasons we are letting go. Even if this day won't come. Yeah, do that again. I like it. Yeah. Henderson. Hey, man. Are in a tub? Yes. I'm meditating. Dude, I need you, man. I'm in a dark place. I've been betrayed. You know what? I'll call you back, OK? Just give me 20 minutes. I feel like doing something horrible, dude. Zane, don't do anything. SINGER: [SINGING]... invincible, if we could know the day. And all the world could rise against us. And we'd dare to fight. Who the fuck are you? I'm Zane. And I know where you can find Mark. SINGER: [singing] We could never fall. So with a head full of fire, we'd be invincible. [music playing] Sound guys, set guys, pick your battles. You're stepping on each other. And we're on a time crunch. I need more metal trusses. This looks like the enchantment under the sea dance. - You got it. - Hi. Hey. Isn't this amazing? Wow. You'll sit here. Whoever you choose the interview will be right here. I need two more of those. Look, we need to talk. Did you find your story? Yes, but it's not what you want. You promised me. I know, but I found something better, Lance. It's happening right under your nose. And this involves me how? Hollywood's top agent finds a new method of discovering talent. Sexy. Go on. You sign two guys off the street. And then you nurture them and support them as they search for their one true talent. That's strong. But how do... oh, my god. Don't tell me, Zane? Yes and his friend Mark. What they're doing is incredible. It could inspire other people to find their one special talent. You think they have special talent? I do. It's about... it's about passion. And it's about dreams. It's not about followers or being famous. The story's got heart. What do you need from me? Hi, Dream Catchers. I'm your host Evelyn Ross. And I have spent the last week at the Hotel Angeleno, meeting with Hollywood talent agent Lance Barber's Pool of Talent. For the last two years, I've been on a quest to find something unique and different, the same feeling that I got when I was on the hunt for this job at Dream Catchers. And I think that is why you're really going to love these two young men that I'm going to introduce you to. So here we go, Dream Catchers. It's time for the journey of a lifetime. Dude, where have you been? I've been calling you nonstop. About what, bro? About this, man. Look around. What is all this? It's for us. Dude, Evelyn hooked it up. You slept with her, didn't you? What? I saw you, man. No. I saw both of you. No, man, I'm telling you, we didn't... Hey, guys. What do you think Zane. Oh, it's amazing. You're just full of surprises. Guys, sit down. Look, I want you to know that I believe in you guys. I could've given this spot to any of my clients. But instead, I'm giving the opportunity of a lifetime to my janitor and his new best friend. He's not my friend. I hate you. Focus. All right, guys. You OK? Yeah, we're good. Mm-hmm. You're not nervous are you? No. Well, I'm gonna take the lead. And we will just keep it nice and loose. I'm as loose as a goose. Let's start by telling our viewers how you guys met. Mark talked me into a threesome. What he... what he means is, you know, like a threesome, we were really forced to trust each other right from the get go. Yeah, trust, that's critical in the bachelor lion code, isn't it, Mark? Yeah. So whose idea was it to move in together? Zane's, it was his idea, you know? And honestly, we've been on this just wild, awesome journey ever since. Brilliant. Have you hit any obstacles so far? Oh, let's see. Our first real obstacle would be you. Excuse me. I've loved you ever since the minute that I met you. Oh, shit. And he can't keep his hands off you. I'm telling you, we didn't do anything. You slept with her, Mark. I know you did. No, we kissed. Dude, you promised not to see her. Come on, man. You agreed not to see me? Mark, you slept with her. You're so full of shit. Man, I'm telling you the truth. Let's just... No, no, no. You betrayed me. So guess what, bro, I betrayed you. Yeah, well, what are you even talking about, huh? Now we're even. Did you get all that? Oh, my god. That was brilliant. [music playing] [engine rumbling] Grandma? [music playing] Look at you. You're so big. Mom, you're a painter? Mom, these are beautiful. That one I made for you. Do you remember? Which one? The one in the middle. No, I don't. Why did you stop? After a while, I just lost interest. I had to work. And I don't know, maybe I got a little lazy. Can I ask you something? You know, everybody on earth has a talent. What's mine? What? Zane, you have so much talent. Yeah, like what? When you were six years old, you'd run around our whole neighborhood just knocking on everybody's door, checking to make sure that no one was sick. I remember that. And when I'd get home from work, you'd sit down at the end of my bed, just rubbing my feet. So what you're saying is that I'm a nice guy, and that's my talent? How am I supposed to make money at being a nice guy? Zane, if that's what you think you're talents for, you're wrong. I mean, we all need to make money to pay bills, yeah. But you use your gifts and your talents that God gave you to make people happy. I mean, that's what they're for. And you do that. Oh, man. What is it? It's my friend. Mom, I got to go. OK. I love you. Bye, love you. I promise you, man. My dad said it was... It was his money, OK? I wouldn't... I wouldn't do that to you. MAURICE: Stop a sec, all right? Wait, wait. [whistles] Daisy, cut... Cut the shit, cut it. Go on, yes. Maurice, man, I just wanted to get my car back, all right? Please, wait, sit down. Sit down, Mark, all right? We talk. Let's talk. Sit down nice. I didn't know it was your money. My dad said it was his. I just wanted to get my car back. You want some tea? No. I just wanted to get my car back. I didn't. You know me, man. I wouldn't have disrespected you like that. I didn't know that. Well, you know, I appreciate that you come here, OK? Thank you. To show up like this, it took courage. But I have something for you to do, all right? Look, this is a Scaglietti all right, Ferrari 612, 2006. Now, you bring this car to me, Mark, and we're good. We're good. I forget good all. No, Maurice. How about I pay you, like... I don't know, like a payment plan or something, you know? I don't know, $500 a month. Like a payment plan. I'm serious. You want payment plan, like I'm a banker? Listen, how about they fuck you in the ass? How about I fuck you in the ass? You want this? Bring me this car the we good. Two fucking hours, bring the car, fucking punk. Wait, don't move. Don't move. Stay there. Stay right there. Don't move. Smile, Mark, so I can send this to your father. The last picture of his son. [music playing] Mark, how did you find me? We're GPS buddies, remember? Would you please get out of here, huh? I'm probably going to jail tonight. Why are you doing this? If I don't steal that car well, Maurice is going to kill me, all right? Mark, I'm sorry. We're still bachelor lions. No, we're not. Well, we're still friends. Don't do this, Mark. Would you just shut the fuck up? Your whole bachelor lion thing, man, is not real, OK? And guess what, I have to live in the real world. All right, well, you want to give up on yourself? Go right ahead. But I believe in you. I'm serious man, do not... Do not start with that, OK? When you say stuff like that to the guys like me, it gives us false hope. Yeah, yeah, it's like it's like telling somebody that they won the lottery. That's not cool. Just face the facts. I'm... I'm nothing, all right? And I got to live with that every day, all right? So just let me be. OK, good. But I'm not letting you take this car. - Give me that back. - No. I'm serious. Give me that fucking back right now. Dude, I will fight you. You want to fight me right now? - Yes, I will fight you. - Are you kidding? Did you just... What the fuck is this? That's what you are? You're nothing? Do you want to fight me right now? Wow, you gotta be fucking kidding me. Get the fuck out the car. You got to be some dumb motherfuckers. Y'all trying to steal from Beat Master G? Who? The hardcore gangsta rapper. OK. Man, get the fuck inside. OK, OK. Brother, we just met, bachelor lions. You're a bastard lion. Man, shut the fuck up, and sit down. What the fuck were you two thinking? Nobody steals from Beat Master G. You know what the irony is? We don't even want the damn car. He spends $5 G's a month for that motherfucker. He can't afford that shit. He hasn't had a hit record in five years. But we couldn't let punks like you get away with shit like that. Right. It wouldn't feel right. Yo, let me pistol whip these fools right now. No, fuck no, because I'm not getting blood all over my carpet. Yo, just real quick, I did not want to steal that car, all right? I don't even like stealing cars. I'm not that good at it. No, you've gotta be fucking kidding me. You not listening to this shit, are you? G, back in the day, you would have beat these motherfuckers upside the head with a hammer. Man, take this gun, shoot these crackers. And let's get drunk. We don't have do any of that. Time to die, motherfuckers. You don't fuck with the Beat Master G. Wait, wait, wait. What the fuck is this? What is this? Yeah, dude, that's his beat. That's his beat. It was made for a rapper. - It's dope, dude. - A beat? These motherfuckers... Y'all making rap music? Dude, it's dope. [music playing] Damn. Shit. I like this. Ooh, that's that fire, man. Yo, y'all motherfuckers made this. Yo, I don't know what brought you two here. But I'm taking that. Yeah. Really? Yeah, yes. Dude, go for it, man. Yo, what we going to do about the car? Who gives a fuck about that car, man? Shit, I've got a suggestion. I say we take that song and let these motherfuckers take the car. I mean, shit, it's insured any fucking way. Yeah. You two are some lucky motherfuckers. We're so lucky. Thank you so much. Yo, I do have one quick question for you, though. You're Beat Master G's manager, right? Yeah, so what? [engine revving] We good? Better than good. Why don't we partner? No, thanks. I already got a partner. [music playing] I love you, buddy. I love you too. [laughs] Hi, Dream Catchers. I'm your host Evelyn Ross. And tonight I have a question for you. What are you doing right now? Do you love what you're doing? Look, I am going to be honest with you. I've had a wonderful week. And I've met a lot of very, very sweet people. And I wish them all well. But I wasn't finding anything that I hadn't seen before. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for being here. Two of my newest artists, Mark Myers and Zane Daniels have a very big surprise for you tonight. So let them hear how excited you are. Hey, what's up, motherfuckers? Yo, I'm Zane. This is my boy Mark. And it is my pleasure to introduce to you our boy, Beat Master G! [cheers] One, two, three, drop. [mark's beat plays] [SINGING] I'm mobbing with a low key strut. Feeling like '88 in a seven-odd cut. Searching for a check, on a mission. Give it up. When you see me on gas, trip. Bitch nigga, what? Never satisfied solidified since a pup. Bust rhymes, bust nines, fuck minds. Now, that's a surefire way of getting fucked up. Back when the homies rolled a glass house. All I'm trying to do is build a million dollar cut, break minds off, and don't say nothing. Dude, Beast Master G just rapping to our beat. Are you kidding me? How in the hell did you make that happen? Oh, my god, you wouldn't believe it. I'm seriously impressed. Evelyn, I am so sorry. It's OK. You think we could start fresh. Cheers to that. Friends? Maybe you could get your friend a beer. Oh, my god, yes. - Yes, oh, my gosh. - Let's go. A beer. Are we going to finish that interview? Are you sure you want to? Yeah. We posted a few seconds of your argument. People loved it. You got over a million hits already. What? Are you serious? Well, that's worth something. Here's what we want to do. We want To. Cover your journey for a year. Evelyn will follow your every step and report to our viewers on Dream Catcher. Is that OK with you guys? - Yeah. - Yeah. I think we're cool with that. OK, so Mark, we want to focus on you and make it your story. Oh, but you know, but it's our story. It's not just me. Trust me, we've been doing this a long time. If you let us do our job, you'll do very well. Oh, man, Mark, that's cool, man. No, it's not cool. It's bachelor lions, all right? It's you and I. You know, it's both of us or nothing. I think it's stronger with both. Then get in the chairs, both of you. Come on, dude. OK, let's try this again. So what did you think the first time you met Mark and Zane? OK, well, at first, we didn't go wrong. But you know, now, we're... We're a crew. I mean, I spin records for them. So how do you think Mark and Zane are going to do? I think they're going to do really well. They're both really talented. And he doesn't know yet, but I kind of have a thing for Zane. So you both know Mark and Zane? Yeah, it was kind of weird. When Zane was just the janitor, we didn't really talk to him. But now they're both really cool. We would totally sleep with either one of them. Well done, young lions. Well done! SINGER: Because I'm about that, about that. [music playing] Hello, James. You're finally ready? We are. Yeah, we really are. I would like to begin your journey by sharing with you the immortal words of Howard Klein. Close your eyes. [dissonant chanting] The journey begins by removing your cloaks to free your inhibitions. All right, dude, seriously, we're not going to take our clothes off. It's getting a little weird now. That's just weird. OK. [dissonant chanting] You see a doorway. I want you to open the door and walk through that doorway. You begin your search. And you feel warmth, bright light, and complete acceptance. I feel it. I really feel it. Yeah, what now, though? What now? I don't know. SINGER: [SINGING] As long as he's got the heart of a lion, beat of a drum, fear of the hunter in his blood. Witch doctor is trying to smite you. So take the medicine that he gives you. Heart of a lion, beat of the drum... Must choose wisely. What's your name? [laughter] Where were we, my little golden chopstick fortune cookie, huh? You want to know what my fortune says? It says nuts are in my future. [grunting] Sorry. [laughter] What, what? Silence, you impudent fool! [laughter] Shit. No! It's my bird. It is my sex toy. It is not yours. Are you alone? Do you find yourself wishing you had support, friends, family, anyone at all that really cares about you? No! It's a sad sight. Perhaps you're a bachelor lion! [laughter] [music playing] NIK AMMAR: [SINGING] The turn of the night. Hush, little dove till the time's right. Oh, oh, you can run all you like. I'll give you some room to hide out and borrow some time. Sleep it off, lay down for charged up for a for a fight. Welcome to Hollywood. Hollywood. Where the fame is only 15 seconds.
