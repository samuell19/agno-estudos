PISAJ Hello, kid! Yes, you. Are you Aunt Bua's niece? - Are you completely alone now? - I don't have anyone anymore. Why didn't anyone tell me? They all said that we'd better not talk about it. And you live far away from us, here in the big city of Bangkok. We didn't want to bother you with it. They sent you here! All right! Don't worry about it! Noi will show you your room. Don't worry! She's always very direct. That doesn't mean anything. Don't worry! Do you already know what work you have to do? I'm supposed to help in the household and work as a nanny. - Which child is it? - It's Arm, Mr. Tong's son. Really? My cousin Tong already has a son of his own? And where is Tong now? No idea. Apparently he lives with a woman in the south. But he leaves his son with the grandmother. I can''t understand that. Come on, let's go up! Arm! What are you doing here? Getting water. And what are you doing here? I want to introduce you to someone. This is your relative Oui. Did you hear about her? Did he have a nanny before me? Yes, there was one. But she didn't stay long. Come! Arm! Oui now sleeps in your room. Are you happy? You'll probably have to tidy up the room first. But surely you know that. That's how we ghosts are. Some can see us. As a ghost, I can show you how to haunt! And you show me how to get into strange galaxies with the computer! Noi, wait! What's up there? A room for the workers. Everyone thinks I'm dead, but I just died. Well, may I live with you? Which wardrobe is yours? The one with the stickers. - Fine, then I'll take the other one. - You can't! And why not? Nobody may open that cupboard. But where should I put my clothes then? That's your problem! So that's it, then. - What's in the closet? - It's haunted! There are ghosts in it. - Well, let's see... - No! You'll have to be patient. He's a real nuisance. Is one box enough? Can I have two? Hey, Mai! Get another box for the kid! Daeng, thatâ€™s a job for you! Don't always send others! I asked you. Why always me? Let's give you a good advice. Don't get involved with him! He has strange friends. They broke in here once. Bua caught them. There was a big fuss! They had to repair a lot. Mostly the window and the door. That wasn't cheap. But he didn't steal anything, did he? I don't trust him. What are you looking at? Daeng, why are you standing around? Go back to work! Leave him in peace! When you're gossiping, then do it quietly! None of your business. Who is this? - Bua's niece. Any questions? - No, no more questions. I'll clean the upstairs now. See you tonight! I won't stay overnight. We'll see us tomorrow. Don't you live here? No, almost no one is here at night. Who else is there? That's for sure the cat again. Does nobody live up there? Did you see anyone? Arm! Is it okay for her to sleep with you? Yes. Arm, please eat the liver! I don't want there to be anything left. I don't like it. Eat or should I feed you? I like to take another piece. No! I didn't ask you. Liver is very healthy for the blood. Are you afraid of ghosts? That's a stupid question. There are ghosts here. They haunt around at night. - I don't believe that. - Why not? I have never seen any. So please don't tell nonsense! Then watch it! As soon as it gets dark in the house, they come out! You're watching too much TV. Help me with the dishes! - Arm, what is it? - Hush! - What's happening? - Stop talking! Stop doing that! It's too late for such jokes. - It's time for bed, go! - You are afraid. - For what? - For the evil spirits! Arm, listen to me! There are no ghosts in this world. And if any do exist, then we should see them. You're an expert on ghosts. Why would they be here in the house? - I know why. - Tell me! When someone dies, his spirit doesn't always go away. He stays close to us. The spirits observe us when we sleep or when we are alone. No matter where we go, they're there, especially in the dark. If they want to tell us something, they even try to talk. You have to listen carefully. - Were you scared? - Stop the nonsense! It's enough! And now off to bed, or I'll go to Aunt Bua! Tattle! I'm not afraid. Not afraid? And what was that during supper? Okay, I'm going to bed. Be nice to me, otherwise you'll end up like Sudjai! Who is Sudjai? Oh, and something else! Some spirits don't know that they're already dead. You have to ignore them, otherwise you'll encounter them again and again. Go to bed, Arm! Arm, you're obviously still not in bed. Arm! That really goes too far! If you don't come out of the bathroom, I'll lock you in there. Arm? Don't worry! I can handle you too. Tranquilizers The government has decided to punish drug offenses harder. The new law provides for life imprisonment and even capital punishment. The Prime Minister believes that the drug problem... can be banished from the country within a month. Get out! I have to change the tire. - Will it take long? - No, help me! - Go! Take Oui and hide! - Come, sweetheart! Quick, darling! - What happened? - My car broke down. - Can we help you? - No, that's not necessary. I live nearby. - We can fix it. - Don't worry about it! - It's no big deal. - Oh no. Many thanks! - That's a nice car. - But still it has a flat. Well, come out! Come! Oui! Run away! Flee, sweetheart! Arm, what are you doing? - Why don't you go to the bathroom? - It's dark in the bathroom. - But the light works. - No, it flickers. - Come, I'll go in! - No, then you'll see my... Your willy doesn't interest me at all. Go on, go to the bathroom! No, it's too dark. - There's nothing. Come on! - I don't need to anymore. - Then wash your hands! - No! I don't want to. - Come on! - I'm scared. - Come on, you're a nuisance! - It is too dark! - Otherwise I'll tell Aunt Bua! - I don't care! What's going on here? What's this shouting in the middle of the night? The light in the bathroom is broken. Arm is afraid to go in there. Oh no! Now he's wetting his pants again. - Oui, clean everything up! - Yes. - Give it to me! - No! How else can I dry you off, wise guy! I don't want to! I won't look. Don't be so stubborn! What are you staring at? Leave it! I can do it alone. Go out! Why did you scream like that? It was your fault that Aunt Bua came out. You should thank me for protecting you. Or else Aunt Bua would have picked at you again. Let's be friends! Come on, say yes! Are we friends now? Yes? At least you have survived the first night. But you still have many nights ahead of you. Be nice to me, then nothing can happen to you! - If not then... - Okay, I'll be nice to you. Come, let's be friends! If we're good friends, then I'll always help you. You better watch yourself! Sleep now and don't snore! Oui! You look tired. Didn't you sleep well last night? No, but I couldn't fall asleep for a long time. Why? What happened? Well, last night... Arm has... He peed in the bedroom. - He didn't want to go to the bathroom, right? - How do you know? Djai has often locked him in the bathroom. Now he is obviously afraid of it. Who is Djai? Arm also mentioned her yesterday. She was once Arm's nanny. Her real name was Sudjai. She was here for a few weeks and found that Arm was way too naughty. When the boss wasn't there, she often beat him. When the boss found out, she immediately fired the woman. - How would you know? - I just know. Honestly, I also think Arm is very naughty. I would also have him... Stop it! You'll scare Oui with your talk. Boys are sometimes naughty. That's just normal. He would be nice if I were his nanny. And why, Mai? If Bua's grumpy grandson was naughty, then I would... I'm going. I have to do something. - Oui, clean up the Buddha room! - Yes, sure. Where is Aunt Bua going? Every Friday the boss goes to the funeral pavilion. What's she doing there? She lends spirits her body. I don't know which spirits. It started when her husband died and her son suddenly moved away. She went to a medium and became one herself over time. Many people come to her. She has already helped many people with her abilities. Aeo's husband disappeared and she went to Bua for advice. At that time, an Indian spirit got into the boss's body. Aeo asked where her husband was. He is home already! Aeo searched everywhere in the house. Then she turned on the tap. Her husband got mixed up with gangsters from the district. Is that true? What's she like when there's a spirit in her body? It's really scary. One doesn't recognize the boss at all. She speaks with a different voice. - You're making that up, aren't you? - No, my friend told me. I believe her. Aunt Bua is scary even in normal condition. But with a spirit in her body? Does she also do such incantations here? I don't know. We'll talk again tomorrow. I've finished work now. If it interests you, ask Arm about it. After all he's with her every day. Good luck! Arm! Your grandmother... Um... Never mind! Crap! You distracted me. I just wanted to ask if you're already hungry. Okay, then I'll continue to clean the Buddha room and cook later. Arm. Arm. You left me alone. I'm sorry! I didn't know what that was. Come on, let's go to the room! Quick, get out of there! Come on! What are you doing down there? You didn't finish the Buddha room, right? No, I... Can I continue tomorrow? No, clean the room now! You're really dawdling too much. Get used to it! To things like today? - Sometimes it's even scarier. - Please stop! - Was it better last night? - Yes sure. We're friends now. You sound quite shaky. You're hiding something, Oui! No, I slept fine. Aunt Bua! I have cleaned the first three floors now. Should I continue on the fourth floor? No need. Nobody lives up there. It's so hot up there that you can barely breathe. That's why the workers moved someplace else. Why would you want to live up there? There's enough space in Arm's room! There you go! Why don't you tell her there are ghosts up there? Don't talk such nonsense! Do you want to scare her? No, don't worry! Just tell me! Oh, there are spirits up there who serve our boss. - They like to show themselves to the residents. - Such nonsense! You're probably too much alone at night. Hurry up, I want my pay! Wrong, Mai! Don't take yourself as an example. I'm almost never alone at night. I didn't miss a day at work. So no cuts, understood? Come on, we toss for it! Now we play another game: Number 14, the tank game. Hey, Arm! Let me go! Let me go! What is this? There's nothing there. Arm! Who's at the door? Who do you want to live with then? Maybe with Aunt Pai or Aunt Djit. I don't care. If you could live there, they wouldn't have sent you here. There are many dead. Your parents are not the only victims. The same thing could happen to you if you leave here. Be sensible and stay here! The workers certainly talk to you about ghosts. But tell me honestly, what would be worse for you: A ghost or a bad person? I was afraid that you would go away. Are you hungry? I'd like to make you something to eat. Do you know where she went? Why didn't she say anything? Do you know where Aunt Bua hid the spare key? No, maybe there is none. And we can't go shopping. Maybe she'll be right back. Hey, what are you doing there? You look like monkeys in the zoo. Aunt Bua accidentally locked us in. Please call Noi! Alright! Hello, Noi! Hello! It's me, Mai. I also have a cell phone now. Where are you right now? In Srisaket! Fine! Noi is having a bad day. Why didn't you tell her we are trapped here? She wouldn't come all the way here for that! Ask her if there is a spare key! Now listen! It costs me 12 baht a minute. Are you paying me that maybe? Listen, we can't get out, but we're very hungry. Surely you understand that. Can you get us something? What do I get for this? I take fried meat with rice. What do you want, Arm? I don't care. Then two rice with meat! But please wait a moment! Go to the pharmacy and get me these pills. - The change is for you. - Okay! Now it's 15:55. I'll be back in half an hour. Where have you been so long? The shops in the area were all closed. What could I do? I had to run forever and then pay with a hundred! - You could have called here! - I tried that several times. - You're just screwing with me. - That is not true. The phone didn't ring here. I did call. No idea why it didn't ring! Here, look! Hang on a minute! What is this? My credit is almost gone. Look, I just asked you to help. Is that too much? There could be burglars! What if something happens to me or Arm? What! If they wanted that, they would have already done it. The house is so remote that nobody would have heard you anyway. If something happens to us, then you are the prime suspect. Besides, you'd be guilty for not helping! I beg your pardon? I can't believe this. You're an ungrateful brat! Then just be scared! Bye! - Someone's in the house. - Are you sure? Arm, there're even several. We should call the police. They are not people. They are also looking for a way out like us. But my grandma is not there. People could harm us. Monsters can harm us too. It's best we pretend that they're not there! They're not people, believe me! I've experienced something like this before. You know what's going on with this house. Let's go upstairs and see if they are human or spirits! Arm, take this! Come on, let's go downstairs! Please! They are human. Oui? Arm? How did you get in here? There is someone in the house. In that room! Are you sure? Yes, I saw them myself. Hello! Is that you, Daeng? I'm in the print shop. Look, if Maeo and Tor are home! No, I've no time. Yes. I really saw them. They probably fled. - Are you really sure? - I'm sure. - How did you get in? - It's easy to get in here. - What's up with him? - He's just messed up. Do you still want to get out? I could help you now. Yes, let's go! You! What's the cupboard doing here? Arm, what's wrong? That wasn't me. Then who was it? Friends of Sudjai. It really wasn't the kid. How do you know that they were Sudjai's friends? Because... You shouldn't tell such nonsense if you don't know. They were certainly people. I am being followed for a long time. They want to kill me. You understand, kill me. Now calm down! You have no idea! They killed my parents. And now it's my turn. They're afraid of me going to the police. Theyâ€™re here in the house! Did you take your pills? My pills... Sorry! I bought them and forgot to give them to you. Shit, I must have dropped them upstairs while on the phone. They are tranquilizers. I take them so I don't see things that are just in my imagination. Arm, I'm sorry. Probably there's nobody in the house but us. I'm feeling bad and I suppose you're not feeling well either. Then I'm the only one who seems to be doing well. And now? Do we get your pills or are we going to get out of here now? I think we better get the pills. Do you want to grill spirits with it? I need it for Oui if she goes mental again. Well then, good luck! You said earlier that someone moved the cupboard away, right? She's starting to lose it again. Better shock her! Is Sutdaji still in this house? Is she up in the room? Everyone said that nobody is upstairs. But Sutdaji is here in the house. Is she a human or not? Do you finally believe me? I'm not crazy. They'll get out any a moment. - What's going on here? - Hide! Quick! - What room is this? - The Buddha room. But where are the statues? No idea! Did I really bring you here? Come, Arm! Let's play! Mai, read that to me! I can't do it anymore. - I don't understand a word of it. - Oh no! Please save me from the evil spirits! Can ghosts harm you? Say, are you living under a rock? They can take your soul. Then your body is lifeless and I'll be in trouble. In what kind of shit did I get involved? Grandmother! Grandmother! Grandmother! The boss is back. No more ghosts! - How do we get you out of here? - You have to distract her. Otherwise I'll end up in jail. I'm more afraid of her than the ghosts. Grandmother! Grandmother! Grandmother! Grandmother! Aunt Bua, are you back? I have to ask you something. What do you want to ask? It's about this house. I think that strange things are happening here. I don't know how to describe it. Say what you're thinking! Well it seems like there are dangerous creatures here. I'm not sure. But I think it's haunted. What on earth are you talking about? First come to your senses! We'll talk about it tomorrow. Think about what you're saying! Aunt Bua, Aunt Bua... Wait, Aunt Bua! We made you an evening drink with a lot of lemon. Arm, be quiet! Arm is in the bathroom washing himself. What happened to the door? Save me from the evil spirits! Save me from the evil spirits! I had to go to this room... But it was locked and so... - Did you want to steal from me? - No, what makes you say that? I know for sure that Arm is not in the bathroom. He never hides in the bathroom when he's scared. Get out of my way! Please save me! Get out of my way! You can't! No! Please listen to me! I thought someone broke into the house. We looked around everywhere if anyone was there. Honestly, we looked in every room. Mai came by and helped us. Arm said that they are Sudjai's friends. What did Arm say? Arm said it was his nanny Sutdaji whom you sent away. Arm. I didn't know what Arm meant when he said that Sutdaji is upstairs. He says Sutdaji is not human. But then what is she, aunt? I'm in the closet. Please open up! Sutdaji is a monster who wants to take my grandson. Aunt, what's wrong with you? I am not your aunt but the house spirit! You were too curious. Now you'll pay for that. Relax! Please take a tranquilizer! Shut up! Don't challenge me, you unlucky wretch! You are to blame for your parents' misfortunes. And now it is here too! I'll kill you. If you are so powerful, tell me who killed my parents. And where's the murderer now? You foul mouth! I don't waste my power on the likes of you. Admit that you don't know! Impudence! Die! Arm, do you see someone? No, nobody. Oh no! Oui, there at the door! No, I'm just imagining it. Oui, help me! The bolt is stuck. What now? Arm, shut the door! - What should I do with the cable? - Tie it to the window! Go on, up there somewhere! Quick! Lean against the door! Hurry, hurry! Why are you helping this toad, Arm? Oui, what's wrong with you? This can't go on, Arm. I really need my pills. Otherwise I don't know what's real and what I imagine. I'll distract Aunt Bua and you bring me the medicine. Or do you want to distract her? Ignore the spirits! You said that to me, too. Then they can't hurt you. Yes, they can. These scars are not from my grandmother. Let's go out together! Okay? I want the evil spirits to leave me alone. Please, let the evil spirits leave me alone. Please leave me alone! Please, let the evil spirits leave me alone. Shit! Who's calling now? Oui! Oui! All because of you! Please save me from the evil spirits! Eat the liver! Help your father, my son! Get me out of here! Here, your pills! What do we do with the boss? Shall we call the police? Yes, sure. I'd better leave. Otherwise I'll be arrested for sure. Good! Then hurry up! We should call a doctor, maybe he can save Grandma. Arm, give me the iron bar! You go first! No! Go ahead! Come on, decide! There she is! - No, not in there! - We do have to get in there. Where are they? Please don't harm us! Mai, what are you doing there? Open up! I said, open up! Hurry up! Quick! Arm, quick! Go on, hurry! Open up! Come on, open up! What's happening? At home, there is not only us. - Do you believe me? - Who else is there? Stop! Will you stop? - Let go, you stupid cow! - Excuse me? My grandma said that this wasn't Sutdaji, but a monster. Grandmother knew she had to leave as soon as possible. Grandmother said if we don't kill her then she will kill us. Eat the liver! But she was still there. At night she always tormented me. She scared me when Grandmother wasn't there. She was looking for a way out of the house. Because she couldn't find it, she hurt me. As soon as Grandmother returned, she disappeared quickly. My grandmother has always protected me. If Grandmother hadn't been there that night, then... She saved my life. The psychologists say that Arm is obviously prone to hallucinations. He shows the same symptoms that are also in your file. But the story is true. We didn't lie to you. When did you last visit the doctor? I don't understand. I'll show you something. Your aunt died at 6 PM in an accident. How am I supposed to believe you? We investigated the crime scene and you have nothing to fear. But we have to keep the young man here for questioning. We assume that he broke in. If you stick to your statement, then you'll also be in trouble. What did he say? Well, burglary. If I hadn't broken in, you would be dead. Those cops! Mai, listen! Aunt Bua had a bad accident. I didn't want to kill her. Believe me, the cupboard toppled... No, Mai! She already died yesterday at 6 PM. It was a serious car accident. Look, here it is! That's impossible! Nobody believes us here. We have to lie to the police. Otherwise, Arm and I will end up in a mental hospital. It always hits me! And only because you don't want to be crazy. Don't worry! I'll get you help. Okay, but hurry up! I don't like it here. - Where are you going now? - To visit Arm in the hospital. Say hello from me! Oui, do you think that someone still wants to kill you? Do you see the man standing there? There's nobody there. I'm leaving now. Thank you again! The number of dead after the adoption of the new drug law... has now risen to 2670, but they are just the small fish. The big fish are still escaping the long arm of the law. In addition, it is criticized that many are shot by accident. The opposition criticizes the tactics as deception before the elections. We are still miles away from a solution to the drug problem.
