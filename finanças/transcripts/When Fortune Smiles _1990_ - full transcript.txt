How could you give everything to my sister? Dad, give it to me, I'm your son! Give it to me, Dad. What now? What are you looking at? Dad, give it to me. Change the will in my favor. -Dad, give it to me. -Amitabha! Give it to me! Change it for me, Dad! Don't act like that! Dad, do you want to die comfortably? I'm your eldest son! How can you give everything to my sister? It's just not fair! Damn you! Who would be the chief mourner at your funeral? Dad, change it. Change it now! Give him an injection! Miss, give him an injection. He is suffering badly. Give him an injection. Wipe off my sweat! Honey, aren't you afraid to be cursed for this? One more word and I'll chop you to pieces! How many times did I tell you not to chew gum? And you're still chewing? Stop chewing! Spit it out! I've swallowed it. -Second Master. -What is going on? -Good thing you came. -Upstairs-- Stop talking. Sir, Uncle is here. Go away! Don't come any closer, Second Master. Sign it! Uncle, don't come any closer. Are you all right, brother? Throw that brat out! Get out, you unfilial brat! Don't ever come back to the Chao household! Well, you did it, Uncle! Brother. Master, a woman must stick with the man she marries. I have to follow my husband. Uncle, I must leave. Brother. Hurry up and get Fei Fei back from France to inherit my business. Even though I haven't seen her for over 10 years, but I'll treat her as my own daughter. Don't worry. Give this will to her when she finds a husband. That's my last wish. Fei Fei... Brother! Take it. Master. Don't be sad. Arrange the funeral. I'll take charge here. Go and get some rest. Dad, if Fei Fei doesn't return, Uncle's legacy would be ours and we'll be rich. Don't you feel ashamed? Go and pack some clothes. We'll live here for the time being. We'll give it to Fei Fei when she returns. Don't even think about it! Sir, we're rich! Go back and pack! Don't cry. Just spit it out. My wife has a lover. So you have a lascivious wife? Yes. Lascivious Wife, Horny Woman, Level III Lewdness, Indecent Obscene, Incredible Lechery. You sound like a film buff. You know all the movie titles. It's because my wife has cheated on me. Nice to meet you. I've come to ask you to seduce my wife. We private investigators enforce justice and punish bad guys. We don't sell ourselves. Seduce my wife and let me catch her in the act, so I don't have to pay alimony for the divorce. Isn't that wonderful? Show me your hand. Press the button to decide my life's happiness. Press it. Press the button. Wait. Why did you choose me when there are so many private investigators in Hong Kong? Because I checked and you're the best-looking guy. What did you say? Say it again. You're the... The last word. Guy. Best-looking guy. You're the best-looking guy. It's a deal. Stop gambling if you win. Go away! That's your wife? Yes. My fate is in your hands, pretty boy. Leave first. Hold on. Do you want it? Yes. Good? Yes? Is that a yes or no? What does good mean? Do you want it or not? I want it. -Eight. -Eight. It burst. Will you light these for me? Two of Hearts. That's the best, right? Two of Spades. I win. Sir, you lost again. Damn you! It's only a game, damn it. So what? Sir, don't get agitated. It's bad for your health. Don't be agitated? My dad's so stubborn! We've swallowed the meat, but we were forced to spit it out. How can I not be mad? Sir, your dad is stubborn, but you are clever. Steal the will before Fei Fei returns and add your name to it. Then we're good. To hell with you! What a lousy gimmick! Steal the will and add my name on it. How do I steal it? Sir, someone is playing tricks out there. Hey, you. Do you like to suck? You like sucking so much? You enjoy it? Which finger don't you want? I want all of them. This is for taking fingerprints, this is for poking someone, this is for cursing, this is for wearing a wedding ring. What about the little finger? That's for picking the nose. For picking shit off your nose? Okay, since you like these things so much, pass urine on him. My boss is not in a good mood today. He asked me to pass urine on you to please him. Open your mouth wide. Don't! Your intention is to make your boss happy. -Just let me cheer him up. -Wait! If you can make me laugh, I'll let you go. But what happens if you can't? I'll eat shit. Okay, let go of him. A monkey was the only survivor in a plane crash. People asked the monkey, "What were the passengers doing before the plane crashed?" The monkey said... What were the flight attendants doing? The monkey said... What was the pilot doing? What were you doing then? Then they asked, "What were the passengers doing when the plane crashed?" "What were the flight attendants doing?" "What was the pilot doing?" "What were you doing then?" Is it okay? You call that a joke? It's not funny! What's this? A clip. -And this? -A cup. What if this "hee hee" is clipped onto this "ha ha"? A clip is a clip, a cup is a cup. What's with the "hee hee ha ha"? That's right, "hee hee ha ha." You laughed. Don't play with words, scum! Do you know that I'm waiting for you Do you know that I'm waiting for you Fuck you! I won't cry if I can laugh Fuck you! You're unimportant to me Fuck you! My talent and IQ are both excellent My originality and imagination May scare you Both Wan and Gat are equally important Eat shit if you won't laugh! Scum, don't think only you can do it. Don't follow him. Run! Where are you running to? Sir, you laughed. You laughed several times. Okay, I won't let talented people go. Steal something for me and I'll pay you 100,000 dollars. Steal the governor's purse? Steal my uncle's will! Steal it and add my name to it. Would that work? If I say it works, it works. -What do you think? -Yes. -Yes? -Really, yes. -Really? -Yes. Darling, what is he doing? I don't know. -You don't? -No. It's none of my business, it's really none of... That third party really is tough. It's you, Detective Wong. I'm fine, right? Yes, it's all right. I have something to discuss with you. Are you interested in stealing the third party's jewelry for vengeance? What for? I'm all right. Yes, but I want vengeance. Won't you help me, pretty boy? Say that again. -Pretty boy. -When, where, what should I bring and wear? -Is it nice? -Not bad. Your boyfriend's here. Billy, wait for me. I won't be long. Don't you mind that I'm a garbage collector, Billy? No. Haven't you got your pay, Rubbish Fung? Yes. I got 4,000 dollars for throwing rubbish. And 750 dollars for collecting tin cans. Show me. I was lucky today. I found 5 dollars from the garbage heap. Billy, let's make a wish. Okay. I wish I don't have to be a garbage collector anymore. I wish I were rich and have lots of beautiful dresses. And have a guy who adores me. Into the ocean, you go! What's wrong, Billy? I don't want a garbage lady, but I don't mind getting her money. Drink mouthfuls of water and sober up. You're heartless. I can't swim... You're good. You managed to find someone who looks so alike! Good job! Hey. You're a pervert! He's trying to rape me! You're a pervert! Miss, he... Look, is it pretty? Don't you like it? Am I dreaming? Pinch yourself and you'll see. Do you want to have lots of beautiful dresses and money? I'm a garbage lady. If you listen to me, you'll be a rich lady from now on. You'll live a comfortable life and have anything you want. -No, I don't do those things. I-- -You don't have to do anything. Just play the role of my sister. -Is that all? -Yes. -Do I get to wear beautiful dresses? -Dozens of them. -Do I get to spend money? -A hundred thousand dollars. A hundred thousand dollars? For the rest of my life? A hundred thousand dollars daily. A hundred thousand dollars per day! If one tin can is ten cents, then 100,000 dollars is... One million tin cans! Who changed my clothes? Was it you? Was it you? You've seen everything. How can I live? I don't want that! Damn garbage lady, stop nagging! Do as my boss says. You can insult a garbage lady, but you can't offend a rich lady. Isn't that right, my sister? What do I need to do to act as your sister? Help me steal a will. A will? Aren't we overdoing it? We're only picking her up from the airport. The whole family doesn't need to go. Dad, we haven't seen her for over ten years. The more the merrier. Second Master, Young Master. I have no idea what you're up to. Come on. Go to the airport. Hurry, we're out of time! Get going! Young Master, I'm sweeping the floor. All of us are going. -You're very nimble. -Yes, that's right. Do it as if you're moving to a new house. Damn! That means steal as you like. Okay. Let's proceed separately. I'll go first. Hey. Hey, pretty boy. Sir, your uncle's here. Stand by. Stand by. Wear the earrings. They're so heavy. Can you hear me? Do you have to be so loud? Remember. You're a rich mistress, not a garbage lady. -Understand? -Yes. Don't pick your nose! You saw that? Go. How do you drive? Get out! Lung. Fei Fei. Fei Fei? That is your uncle. Greet him. -Uncle. -Fei Fei. Uncle. -Why did your flight arrive so early? -Yes. Ms. Chao, do you still remember me? She was your nanny. Your nanny. No! She was the nanny who brought you up. She brought you up. No. Why did you find such a stupid woman? -Nanny. -Nanny. Fei Fei, let's go home. You must be tired. Dad, don't go back first. Why? Why? Dad. We were supposed to meet Fei Fei at the airport. It's not merry enough if we don't meet her there. Let's go to the airport and meet you again. Get in. Be careful. My earring! Why should we trouble ourselves? We've already picked her up. Why should we go to the airport? Don't mind him. Get in. No, I'll come again some other day. See? You've scared Fei Fei. Don't mind him. Get in. What kind of walkie-talkie did you buy? Sir, your sister's flight has arrived. -Go and pick her up. -Yes. Drive. It's so good to be rich. I'll take that. You've gone too far. Are you for real? Stop messing around. Are you kidding me? How did you do this? -Let's-- -We're home. We're all here. They're all back. Get up quickly, it's no joke. Hurry up! The whole family is back. Why are you being so loud? Fei Fei, come in. What an idiot! Ms. Chao, have some tea. Ms. Chao, towels for you. It's nice to see her again. Ms. Chao has become more beautiful. Yes, she's different from before. Thief! Thief! I'm so afraid. Thief! What happened? -Second Master, there's a thief! -A thief? Where? Quiet! Tell me. Where's the thief? Second Master, there's a thief on the second floor. The second floor? I'm scared. Where's the thief? He's upstairs. Call the police then. Hold on. What are you doing? You're acting strangely. You can't fool me. You're bold. You've come here to steal. Second Master, I know him. Who? Speak up. I... Her. Me? Yes, I told you I know her. Do you know why... I risked ruining my reputation to dress this way? -It was all because of you. -Me? We haven't met for years. Don't tell me that you can't recognize me. -You're-- -What? You don't recognize me? Bye then. Hold on. Let's settle this clearly. Fei Fei, do you know him? -I-- -Quiet! Aren't you Vincent Han? Come here. Aren't you Vincent Han? Yes, I am. You know, I didn't do it on purpose. You didn't do it on purpose? Poor me who've been secretly in love with you since I was ten. Now, in order to see her, I have to play a thief. If I'm a thief, who's she? A heart-stealing thief! Sir, I'm heart-broken. I'll get going. Vincent Han, come here. I don't get what youngsters nowadays are up to. -Go and get some rest. -Yes. Give it to me. Give it to you? -Aren't you Vincent Han? -I am. Give it to me now. -Now? -If not now, when? Hey. You expect me to give it to you when there's a crowd outside? That would be hard. How am I going to survive tonight if you don't give it to me? Come on, give it to me. -You're really horny. -Horny? Give it to me. There's a crowd outside. We can't make love here no matter what. -Stay away. Be smarter. -Gosh. -How will we face them afterwards? They... -Oh, no. Never mind. So you really know-- -I do know you. I told you. -Right. It's been a long time. You're much thinner now. Yes. -And you've gotten hornier. -Yes. Give me a call when you have time. No, call me when you have time. Fei Fei. Yes? Now, you don't need me to... Let's go out and talk. Where's the will? What? I told you to steal the will. This is my dad's Birth Certificate. I didn't tell you because you flared up that day. You can't steal the will and add a name on it. How can that work? What then? My uncle's properties will go to Fei Fei. What should I do? If your sister marries me and I become your dad's son-in-law, her money will become our money. What do you think? Good idea! How did you know Fei Fei? I don't know her, but I think I look like her ex. Can you see the toilet bowl walking on the street? What do you think? Me? No, I'm seeing things. -I'll see a doctor tomorrow. -You should quickly go. Cut the act. Work hard on it! It's so perplexing. It's perplexing to the head! Right. My head's stuck. Think of something. We have to do it the hard way. -How? -Break it. Don't move. No, it's ear-splitting! Maybe I shouldn't use the hammer. Let's try this. No! No? What about this? -A bit better. -Really? Here I come, once and for all. -Okay. -Bear with it. Problem solved. Are you sure? Do it again. Sorry, it's my fault. Let me help you. What are you doing? It's still stuck. I think this is heaven's will. Heaven's will? What are you talking about? They want you to be a Spittoon Superman. Spittoon Superman? What should I do? A superman's okay, but I want to be a pretty boy, not a spittoon. Listen. Calm down! Don't cry. -A spittoon can be pretty too. -How? This way, not only can you go to the hospital, you can even see the governor. Really? Sure! Is the hat a bit too low? No. Am I really good-looking? No one's better looking than you. Let's go and see a doctor. Four. I'm going to be rich! What a treat! Good morning, Ms. Chao. Why do you have so many tin cans? The butterfly is so beautiful. Is it difficult to catch? No, it's not too hard. I'm crazy. I'm Chao Fei Fei. I'm not Rubbish Fung, I'm Chao Fei Fei. Rubbish Fung. Bitch, you're trying to get away from me. Let go. I didn't. I didn't try to get away from you. Why didn't you contact me last night? I dropped my earring. Don't play any tricks. What about my dad's will? I fell asleep because I was too tired. Damn it! You scum! I told you not to come back. -What happened? -Nothing. Get out! Hey. Can't I come back to see my sister? Fei Fei doesn't have a bad brother like you. He tried to steal the family assets and drove your dad to death. Fei Fei, don't you always listen to me? Fei Fei, don't listen to him. Fei Fei. -Who shall I listen to? -Me. Sir. Uncle, I'll listen to you from now on. And live a good life here. I won't listen to you anymore. Damn you, Rubbish-- You're good, Fei Fei. -Eat some porridge. -Thank you. Fei Fei, do you have a boyfriend in France? I don't know. Don't be shy. Get married if you do. So that you can inherit your dad's assets sooner. What assets? The jewelry business that's worth billions. Then I've done my part. Fei Fei, does that man who came yesterday really like you? Does he? Maybe. Ms. Chao. I caught the butterfly. Thank you. -Dad. -Yes? That man yesterday is quite nice. He's knowledgeable and good in martial arts. He's well-educated and good in fighting. How do you know? He told me. Do as I tell you. Why didn't you say I'm good at eating, shopping, watching movies, giving massages, hairstyling and doing nails? I specialize in all those. How about mixed martial arts? More or less. Go to the ring then. Where are you going? Don't be afraid, I know them. Come here. Get up. Stop pretending. Do you get it now? No. I'm afraid I'll be the best among them. Come on. Don't worry about it. Come on! Grandma bent and raised her leg. The pretty girl looks at the mirror. She looks left and right. The Thunderbolt, the Invincible Wheel. Now, the Whirlwind Kick. -Dad, let's ask him to go for coffee. -Grandma bent and raised her leg. The pretty girl looks at the mirror. She looks left and right. -Bill. -The Thunderbolt, the Invincible Wheel. Look, the Tiger Kick. Hey, what are you doing? Again. Look, the Tiger... He's with my dad. He's easy to handle. -You must win. -What? That doesn't count. It was just an act. I'm done. I'll call it a day. Again? I've got AIDS. Mind if I lick you? We're neighbors. I live in a village behind your dad's. Village? -In the village behind-- -Village again. -I live behind your village. -Village? I mean I'm your biological brother. I'm your son! Again? Ask your mom if you don't believe it, creep! Go to hell! You hit me no matter what I say. Do you think you're all that? Was I born to be beaten by you? Left hook punch. Left hook punch. Left hook punch, again. Left hook... It's the right discus, creep! Arrange a dinner at home when he's free. What? You asked him to come for dinner tonight? Yes, he's smart. I'll check him out for you. One more thing. He wants me to give you this letter. Uncle, I've been in France too long, I can't read Chinese. Will you read it for me? Okay. "Ms. Chao Fei Fei, I'm like a lone raft at sea, waiting for you to salvage me. You are love's executioner. I'm willing to die for you. Even if you suck my blood dry, I'm ready to be your slave if you want me to. Just say, 'Come.'" What? He has come? Uncle, I'm going upstairs first. Fei Fei, be careful. Did you get hurt? Are you all right? Please come in and have a seat. Make yourself comfortable. Have some tea. Please have some tea. Again, please have some tea. Please have some tea again. You're good, sir, but this is no longer the trend nowadays. Is that so? Please have some tea. Thank you. I heard you studied Psychology in the UK. Yes, Dad. He's so smart. What's Psychology? Do you normally flush the toilet after using it or use it after flushing? Flush after using it, of course. Is it too rash to flush it half way? I don't know. Let's make an experiment. Relax your body. Keep your head still. Move your eyes to the ceiling slowly. -Are you looking at it? -Yes, is this right? Do you feel fatigue in your eyeballs? Yes, a little. It means you have neurasthenia. Let's do another experiment. Let's hold out our hands, a bit farther. Normally when we jack off... I should say masturbate. Too much masturbation makes the palm black. Did you know that? Sir, your son uses the right hand to do it. And this is psychology. Am I right? He's made a fool of you, idiot. Is that funny? Sir, just now you looked at both hands. It means you normally use both to do it-- All right. Dad, I don't do it that way. I do it like you. What? Sit farther away. Take your seat. By the way, since when did you know each other? Never mind, let's have a drink. -How about I-- -I should test you. Do you remember when we first met? Yes, of course. But I prefer to forget the past. I'm sorry. Just like when I played a thief that day, I don't-- All right. That's fine. Fei Fei. I can hardly recognize you now since you've been in France for ten years. Really? I can hardly recognize myself too. Let's just forget the past. Let's start all over again. -Let's start from scratch. -Let's toast. -Cheers! -Cheers! This is not bad, Vincent. Yes, Fei Fei. And this is nice too, Vincent. Yes, Fei Fei. This is my favorite. This one? -Don't you like it? It's nice. -No. -What is it? How come? How strange. -Yes. -It's you. -It's you. Wait a moment. Since I got stuck that day with the spittoon and couldn't see anything, I've taken an interest in goggles. Have you? Excuse me, I have a friend with me. -I'll-- -Sure, go ahead. Do I look handsome today? You look okay, but maybe a bit dirty in the butt. Because I think you forgot to wipe... Right? Take the whole packet. Today's painting exhibition was great. I felt like something was lacking. -Really? -There's a taxi, let me hail it. What? -Do you want to have a fight? -Fight! -You want to fight us? -You're taking our taxi? Let's beat him up! Ms. Chao. The car's over here. I've forgotten we've got a car. Don't be silly. It wasn't your fault. It was my fault. Don't be silly. She looks like her. Ms. Chao, this is our Sales Manager, Mr. Yao. Welcome back to Hong Kong. -He's our Personnel Manager, Mr. Chou. -Nice to meet you. Hi, Ms. Chao. How do you do? Ms. Chao, I'm Simon, the Financial Officer. I'll let you guys talk. Your dad also talked about you a lot before he passed away. I think you'll be a charming boss. Do you want to have a drink, Rubbish Fung? So it's you, Rubbish Fung. Why didn't you tell me you're rich? What is he doing? I don't know him. Hey, are you a gatecrasher? I'm sorry. Is it out of line if the Financial Officer asks his boss to dinner? Is it? No. I don't want to dance anymore. Why are you so late? Am I in your way? Fei Fei. The company would like you to make a speech. What? What should I say? Hi, I'm Simon Lo, the Financial Officer. Simon Lo, nice to meet you. I'm Vincent Han. They say you've wooed her for over ten years. And you played a thief lately to see her. Right? Yes. I can't stand the smell of matches. Me, too, I can't stand the smell of gas. Hopefully, everyone would cooperate and clean the office with the broom and dustpan. What a good metaphor. Anyone who performs poorly will get laid off. That's right. If you go to the landfill, you'll see that rubbish is actually useful. This biscuit tin, for instance, can be used as a flower pot. And these wrappers and newspapers can be sold for eight dollars a catty. If the company recycles these, it will serve both purposes and hit two birds with one stone. Everybody will be happy. It will please the garbage collectors too. These tin cans are ten cents each. They're very useful. Take them. Now, you can't deny you're Rubbish Fung. That's all. Rubbish Fung. Don't run! You're a rich mistress from Paris. Didn't you come from the landfill? What do you want? What do I want? You're rich now. You don't even know me. -Let me touch you. -Stop. Stop? Okay, I'll shout! Don't. I'm poor. You know what to do. I'll give you all these. Give me a kiss, okay? I'll shout if you turn me down. Come on! -A kiss? -A kiss. Isn't it mouth to mouth? Come on, mouth to mouth. What do you want? What did he do? What happened? It's you again? You assaulted my girlfriend? You're taking advantage of her? You're making advances? You're making advances? Fei Fei, don't worry because I'm here. Ms. Chao, don't worry because I'm here too. Where did you get that? Great, but I see that you've killed someone. What? He's dead? Wake up. You can't die so easily. Don't scare me. -What happened? -Sir, he killed someone. -"Killed someone"? -"Killed someone"? Don't be afraid. What are you saying? Take him away. If I came earlier, this might not have happened. You won't blame me, right? No... She... won't. Our... mistress... won't... get... angry... so... easily... I said... Are we out of fuel? Let's fill the tanks. No... we... have... We... must... get out. Thank you. Ms. Chao. What happened? Last night while walking by the shore I met a really pretty girl She stared at me with those beautiful eyes And gave me a pretty smile She got me to cruise around with her I called her Fei Fei And she was so happy I called her Fei Fei Any tin cans? Yes. Be careful. You're nimble for your age. Great! If I pick tin cans for a living, will you still want to get to know me? Yes. I called you Fei Fei and you were so happy Last night while walking by the shore I met a really pretty girl She stared at me with those beautiful eyes And gave me a pretty smile I'll get going. -I'm sorry, Second Master. -She's not back yet. What should we do? It's... my fault. All right. Uncle. The mistress is back. Ms. Chao, where have you been the whole night? We were worried. Where have you been? Don't ask her, Nanny. I get what youngsters do. Go to bed. You all didn't sleep the whole night. Fei Fei, sit down. Let's chat. Uncle, I'm sorry to keep you waiting all night. It's fine. Is that boy okay, Fei Fei? Do you like him or not? Silence means yes. -Can I make arrangements for you? -Uncle, I-- Don't be shy. I'll arrange it for you. Am I good, Fei Fei? My uncle wants us to get married. Do you want to? You decide. Well, let me speak theoretically. If I were an impostor, would you kick me into the sea? I've been kicked into the sea once. Stop! Stay down! Follow them! What's the matter? Stop or I'll finish you off. -Why is this happening? -I don't know. -Take the wheel. -I don't know how to do it! Help! Don't! Go! Hurry and jump! Help! Help! You're trying to escape? -Give it back to me! -Quiet! "I'm like a lone raft at sea, waiting for you to salvage me." A lone raft? Burn that lone raft for me! Don't, I beg you! Don't? You betrayed me. You won't listen to me? I will. -You really will? -I'll listen to you. If so, take this packet to Uncle for me. What is it? An elixir that makes you bleed and die within five seconds. Don't, I beg you! Don't! Fine! Feed them to that lone raft! No! Give it to me! Let's see who you'd like to feed it to. Ms. Chao, do you want some tea? Let me do it. That won't be necessary. -Let me do it. -I can do it. Sam, let me do it. Ms. Chao, we embroidered this for your wedding. It's beautiful, isn't it? Is it beautiful? Have some tea, Ms. Chao. I made it for Uncle. I'll bring another cup for Second Master. It's from the mistress. Fei Fei's so nice. I wanted to have tea. Uncle, don't drink it. Why? This cup of tea is mine. Fei Fei, come here. I have nothing to give you but this bracelet. I kept it for over 10 years. Take it as your wedding gift. Uncle, don't drink it! Is it yours too? You're like your dad, who fought over everything with me. What's wrong, silly girl? It's only thunder. With me here, you have nothing to fear. Uncle, don't die! Why would I die so fast? I must attend your wedding. -Are you all right? -What's wrong? I'll take you as my own daughter from now on. What? What? -No one will know if you keep it a secret! -What? No one will know if you keep it a secret! You're trying to escape? Don't run! Here's more. You're trying to mess around with me? Stop at the MTR station, please. -MTR station? -Go! Bye, Ms. Chao. Fei Fei. How did you manage to get away? Let's not talk about that. Tell me now. What's going on? Tell me. I was born and raised here and I collected garbage here. Excuse me! Please make way. Don't be in my way. You think you're all that since you're rich? You don't own this place. Fatty Lan. Why come here when it's pouring. She's crazy. Now, no one knows you were a garbage lady. You're now a rich mistress. You can't go back, nor can I. Listen, I'm also an impostor. I conspired with Chao's son to seduce you to get money. Then that letter... That's unimportant. Just bear in mind that the riches in that place are real. Understand? Your feelings for me are fake? No. There's no real or fake thing in this world. If we can get real money, we can live a real life, right? It's a good opportunity that came from heaven. We must not miss that opportunity. Mr. Vincent Han, do you take Ms. Chao Fei Fei as your wife and fulfill your duties as a husband? I do. Ms. Chao Fei Fei, do you take Mr. Vincent as your husband and fulfill your duties as a wife? I do. Okay. From now on, you're the legal heirs to the Chao Jewelry Enterprise. Wait, she's an impostor! My uncle conspired with her for my dad's money. She's not my sister. They're swindlers. Stop that nonsense! Don't spread rumors! You don't believe me? Ask her! Fei Fei, is that true? Yes, I'm an imposter. I'm not Chao Fei Fei. Sorry, Mr. Chao. It's all-- -Shut it. Let's go to the police station. -Go! -It's none of my business. -You're trying to escape? Go! -What? -Go! I'll go by myself. You're swindlers! No wonder the company accounts don't reconcile. The company will stop operations temporarily to check our losses. Go back to audit the books. Yes. -You heard him. Let me check everything. -Yes. Uncle, it's your day of reckoning. Wei, I don't know what you're up to. Don't be smug, the will in your hand says that you don't get anything. Thanks for reminding me. This will? Look at this will! Don't tear it! There's no will. There's nothing in my way now. -That will is fake. -That will is fake. Let me out. Let go! I'll deal with you very soon. -Sir, I'll head back to the office. -Okay. Sir, the ship is here. Why are you here? I didn't get anything when I was with you. Look at me now. You traitor! Beat him up! Take them all to the station for statements. Mr. Chao, are you all right? Why didn't you tell me she was fake? You tried to betray me and get my money? Are you blaming me now? You don't even recognize your own cousin. How dare you say that? Shut it and let's try to get out of here instead. You want to get out? -Any ideas? -None yet. Use your head. What? Do you think I'm stupid? -Stop that lousy gimmick. -There's no need to poke me. Haven't you had enough last time? I can't take it anymore. You keep on poking me. Come on! Dad, how do you feel? Get wood and kerosene. Burn the house! -Are you out of your mind? -Stay away! Wait. This is a Chao family affair. It has nothing to do with them. Okay, I'm begging you. Let them go first. You're begging me? Did you hear that? My uncle is begging me. I didn't hear you clearly. Say that again! -Wei. -Master Wei. Okay. Master Wei! Show your sincerity. What do you want? Get on your knees and bow to me three times. Are you going to do it? If you can't, just shut it! Set the fire! Okay, I'll kneel! Dad, don't! Let me! Master Wei, I beg you... Stay away! You're still young. How are you going to face people? -Listen! -Stay away! Dad, you're old. You shouldn't do it. Stay away! Dad! Dad! Lick it, lick it clean! Lick it clean, come on! Come on! I hate the word lick the most and you said it so many times. This is ridiculous! Let's die together then! -Look. -Give me a hand. -You're so cruel. -Help me. -Let go! -Sock him! -Come on. -Sock him! Let go! Harder! Give me back my shoe! Give it back. Nobody wants it. Sir, it's done. Sir, the ship is waiting. Okay. Hey, have a family reunion, you bastards. Set the fire! -Hey. -What are you doing? Open up! Let us go! Fei Fei. Are you for real? -Don't do this. Let us go. -No, I'm begging you. I was joking. I'll buy you new shoes! Don't do this! This way. Help me! What are you doing? What? Madam, come on. Get on board. I don't want to die! Damn you, garbage lady! It's all your fault! You've ruined our whole family! -I'll kill you! -It's not my fault! -What are you doing? -I'll strangle you to death! Don't do it! -Are you out of your mind? -Stop. Here's burlap cloth. Get it wet and cover your face. Where do we find water? Think of something. -Give it to me! -What are you doing? -Give it to me! -Give it back to me! Give it back to me! What's this? Pee yourself. Why would you take that from me? What? Come on, fuck! Pee! Do you want to die together? Come on! Vincent, give me some. -Can't you do it yourself? -This thing's good for nothing! Sock it then! I can't get anything from it either way! You didn't discipline it well. Help me. Beat it and it will come out. Ask your dad for it. That's right. My dad. Go! Goodbye! Stay away! Dad, give me some urine. Dad, urinate for me. Lung, see you in the next life. Stay away! Vincent, see you in the next life. Dad, why is it so yellow? I have UTI. Whatever. Would you tell me the truth before you die? It won't do any good. Have you been intimate with that girl? Which one? That one standing over there earlier. She did this and this. What? Like this and that! Vital statistics! That's the code to the lock. Her vital statistics! -What are they? -What? Vital statistics. 28-29-38. I didn't ask for yours, Hipsy. I'm asking for that girl's statistics. -Wei's wife? -Yes. I think it should be 34-34-34. No, it didn't work. Girls know better. 40-20-40. Hey, could she be so shapely? -Try it! -Try it! Take a chance! -It worked! -Thank God, we're saved! Go! Be careful, Dad! Let me help you. Take care, Dad! There's water. Fei Fei, help me untie it. We're saved! Yes, great! Fei Fei, I'm sorry. I couldn't stop that bastard from seizing your dad's money. Mr. Chao, I've never done one good deed in all my life. Let me help you now. -You're in charge here. -Me? Oh, no. I forgot the most important thing. What is it? No way. -Cheers! -Cheers! What happened? Sir, let me go out and check. Go out quickly. Someone poured gasoline on the ship. Bad news, sir! You're still alive, you bastard! Hey, let's talk about this. Throw down that case of jewels when I count to five. Otherwise, you'll die. One... Okay! I'll give it to you! You two go down. Yes! I'll give it to you! Give it to him! Wait. Here it is. You didn't die from the fire. You're lucky. Now, I'll dump you to sea. Let's see if you'll die. Dump him to the sea to drown him! Wait. Stay away! I don't mind dying, but I have one last demand. What is it? Can you let me take two oxygen tanks? That's funny. I have no oxygen tank. I'll give you an oxygen mask. Hey, what are you doing? Help. Okay! Hey, who are you dealing with? It's serious. They're... So you won't help me, pretty boy? Let's go! Okay! That's what they did. -You've handled it? -Yes. Let me help you. -Be careful! -It's messy. What now? -We have fish guns. -Fish guns? When we get inside, let's hold them back and shout, "Freeze!" Then take the gems and jump into the sea through the window. Understand? Yes. -Everyone... -Everyone... You handled it? -Oh, no. -Yes. What now? Hurl a wine bottle at his head later then proceed as planned. -Let's drink. -Cheers! -Sir, we've handled it! -Yes. Hey, let's sail! -Okay. -I'm really excited today. Cheers! Have a drink. Get them! Catch! Break through the window! I'm stuck! I'm stuck! Let go! I'm stuck! Let go. It's not stuck. Finish him off for me! Pretty boy, I've been looking for you. Don't run if you have guts! I'll find you later. Okay, let's not waste time. Let's have a one-on-one, okay? Those not involved, get lost! You kicked me? Everyone, I'll go ahead. You're smart! Again? Have a bursting buoy. Explode! Come on! Get bigger. Explode! Cover me! Rubber Superman. How this did happen? Do I look good? You missed. The Centipede Bounce. And again. The Centipede Bounce. Again. Are you done bouncing? Are you done with them? -We haven't gotten the gems. -Hey. I've seen you so many times. You're always stuck. Darling, take me with you. Duck and make it snappy! -Darling, don't leave me behind. -Let go! -Darling, take me with you! -Get lost! Darling, don't go! Don't go! Stop! Don't kill me. He wants you to kneel down. Lick my toe! -Go! -Go! Go! You brat! Let's see if you dare to make trouble again. I won't do it again, Dad. Actually, we should thank Vincent Han. -That's right. -Uncle. We're rushing back to the office for a meeting. Get in. By the way, have you seen them lately? No, Dad. Fung. Look, the rich mistress is back to collect garbage. There are many cans here. Do you want them? Should a rich person collect tin cans? Mistress. Cham Fen Dou from Shek Tong Tsui is looking for you. Are you interested? Don't be a spendthrift. I copied from Reader's Digest the whole night. Let's have a drink. Where? The top spots, of course, like The Regent or Shangri-La. Otherwise, how would it fit you? The painting here is not bad. -This one is not bad. -It's nice. This is nice too. Cham Fen Dou is coming to see you tonight. You're going to be rich! What did you say? What? Do you want to get beaten up? -Wheel Fists! -Wheel Fists!
