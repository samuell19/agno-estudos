Pooja who? The manager? Come on! You're giving the employer the status of an employee? This is the limit! Thanks to her, so many poor guys have found jobs Take my case. Hadn't she put in a word for me to her father, the employer... could we have been chatting in this posh, air-conditioned office? What a shame! You're making my head swim with rubbish That girl has made a sucker out of you She got rid of you the other day and snatched your job. That's it! What does that mean? - l mean, she's just... an executive manager. Nothing else! Which means, the boss isn't dear papa at all? Chopra, the old fossil, is a rotten old fig! And he's still a bachelor! You mean Pooja didn't recommend me at all? My dear naive boy! Recommend you? She's been cutting you out all the way! Really? So she took me for a ride! - Yes. And took me all over Delhi! - Oh yes!

Let her come. l'll show her l'll teach her such a lesson, she'll never think of conning anyone again Do come My word! Sit down. Why're you standing? - How can l sit in your presence? You have done so much for me You took my destiny into your hands and made my life You've recommended me to your Papa at the breakfast table! l do that very often. - ln a flying Mercedes car... you weren't thinking about yourself. You thought of me lnstead of the Executive Manager, you made me the General Manager! You're such a great person. lt's amazing, Poojaji! Would you like to have some tea? - Tea...? What...? You dare make a fool out of me? Shiv? Call me ''Sir'' ! Poojaji! l went about worshipping you. And you kept making a fool out of me! The pampered daughter of the dear Papa... you're a sympathiser of the poor and recommend them, don't you? You played around with me! You conned me the first time we met... and walked away with my job! And as if that wasn't enough... you polished off fancy delicacies with your brother at the 5-star hotel! Like a madman, l went around Delhi looking for you... and you were sitting in the theater, watching the latest movie! And l still got laddoos made for a stone-hearted girl like you! With clarified-butter! So tell me now, Poojaji... what am l to do with you? Must l kill you? Or let you go?

This diamond-watch is terribly expensive So l was scared. - l was looking for you too l wondered how l would return to you, what is yours Shiv, may we return her thing to her? l've got my precious watch! Listen to me, okay... Hear me out, Pooja. - What's there to say or listen to? Maybe you're making a mistake, Pooja. Maybe it's something else... Shiv could explain only if you're prepared to listen, isn't it? What will he explain to me? l've met the girl... he spent the whole night with! l'll never forgive him! Whatever happens, l'm not going back to him! Enough! You break your relationship for every little thing? You're willing to walk out of your house for nothing? This isn't how you go through life. Marriage is no child-play... that you blow a thing like this out of proportion, Pooja Listen to the truth, if you must. Shiv called us to the fair... to prepare for a surprise birthday party for you l insisted on sitting on the giant-wheel and the poor man agreed Our misfortune! The giant-wheel broke down... and we had to spend an entire night in it! When we got down, Shiv requested us not to tell you... that he had spent the night sitting with another girl He said Pooja wouldn't be able to take it. And he was right too! He was right. You have done just what he expected you to do! lf you have any sense, go back to your husband... seek his forgiveness and bring him around! Not at all Pooja does not need to seek my forgiveness She need not apologise to me. lt's enough that she loves me so much And yes, she has a very unique way of loving me And this is what l'm crazy about l know it, Pooja. More than the amount of anguish you cause me... you feel tormented yourself. More than you make me ache... you ache too All this, only because you love me so much But l have loved you too, Pooja l have loved you too ''l'm your love, my heart beats for you...'' ''do always be with me'' ''l'm your love, my heart beats for you...'' ''do always be with me'' ''Should you have any grouse against me...'' ''do always tell me'' ''l have loved you too, my love'' ''Yes, l have loved you too'' ''l'm your love, my heart beats for you...'' ''do always be with me'' ''Should you have any grouse against me...''

''do always tell me'' ''You're as mischievious as a madman...'' ''but l know the truth about your heart'' ''Don't you understand what the climes tell us...?'' ''We can't do on our own anymore'' ''Don't take such a deep breath, be not so naughty...'' ''don't be stubborn'' ''Should you have any grouse against me...''

You know l'm here for the conference. lt's only till this evening l'll be back in a jiffy. Go shopping till then Eat and go to sleep. And dream of me You're the one who's giving me a surprise. lt must be... 5 years since college and when we last met, right? Really? ls it so long already? Pooja, this is Meghna. We studied together in college Know what, Pooja? Shiv was the most handsome guy in college his studies and sports. But now that l see you, l must say... he does have a great choice. You're the one he finally chose Don't believe her, Pooja. Meghna was a brilliant student too She always had a way with words What are you doing in Switzerland? - l came on business ln fact, l must leave now or l'll get late You're put up at this hotel, right? Why don't we have dinner together? So tonight will be an amazing night l'm glad you like some girl at least Hurry up and go now. And come back soon Come on, you've got to get ready What's up, Meghna? - My car has broken down Where have you to go? - To Geneva. To attend a seminar Life sure is a co-incidence! l have a conference in Geneva too Come, l'll give you a ride How about my return? - l've got to return to the hotel too We'll come back together You can talk to me in Hindi. l'm an lndian, Madam Do you have a bigger model of that beautiful house? l want a bigger one. Not right now. You can have it tomorrow. All right then. l'll give you an advance now and pick it up tomorrow At what time tomorrow? - 10:00 a.m. Sharp Namaste. - Namaste Absent-minded professor! You're still forgetful ls your work over? - Yes. And yours? Yes. Shall we leave now? - Let's return. Rouge Mont lt'll take us 3 or 4 hours l still can't believe how absent minded you are. You haven't changed Looks like there's a problem Shiv! How much time will it take? 7 or 8 hours? l'll freeze to death in the car! Ask him if there is a place we can spend time at l suggest l ring up Pooja and tell her that we're held up here The phone had to disconnect now! What happened? - The line got disconnected Let me try and make that call. You go and change lf something happens to you, your wife is going to kill me ''Where have we landed...?'' Why're you laughing? - Why? Look at you! You look crazy! l mean... you look like a mad gypsy! Remember when you played mad gypsy? - l did? When? ln college, of course! Have you forgotten? How we danced during that inter-collegiate competition You aren't to be blamed for what happened, Shiv What happened between us was just an accident You mustn't think l will interfere in your life, Shiv... or that l will pose any difficulty for you And why must you hold only yourself responsible? l played an equal part in it Shiv, l want this to remain a secret between you and me So l'm leaving We will never meet again We will never meet again Not a thought for me! Do you have any defense for the mistake you have made? Will you ever be able to alleviate the agony you have caused to me? Will you ever...? Let me ask you. Had l made the mistake you have made... would you ever have forgiven me? Answer me! Would you forgive me? Do you have an answer...? Speak up! You don't, do you? You can't! You can't have an answer for such a grave sin! There can be no pardon You and l cannot live under the same roof anymore We can't spend our lives together anymore! l will never forgive you! The faith and trust l had in you... You must regret your mistake all your life You must pay a price for betraying my trust l want Divorce Divorce! ''Yes, l have loved you too'' lt's like this, Pooja. You've been through so much, if you think of it But you've been through nothing, if you don't think about it You have been courageous in taking this step Maybe you've done the right thing by not staying with your brother You haven't made your problems the cause of their worry Problems and sorrows are all part of life So why shouldn't a woman face them... move forward, and shape her own destiny? You don't have to tell anyone here that you were married Or that you have had a divorce You know how people view a woman who has been divorced But this is the city of Mumbai in which you have arrived Nobody here cares for the past lives of others People come here to start life afresh There's no saying when and where you will come across a messiah Neha, l couldn't even dream of finding a nice friend like you so soon Now that you're with me, l will surely find a way So be courageous.

Pooja, can't you forget all that? Must you give me such a big punishment for something so trivial? So trivial? You call it trivial? What didn't l do for you? l changed the course of my life! When a woman gives up everything for her man... she nurtures the relationship with sincerity, devotion and desires l honoured every vow l took with you But you forgot the vow of fidelity you had taken with me You had sworn to remain loyal, you had sworn to be faithful By breaking the sacred vows, you have deceived not only me... you have betrayed God too! You are a sinner! And you must be punished for your sins! Really? So what do you want? What punishment do you want to give me? Do you want me to be hanged? l admit, l have made a mistake Pooja But my home was shattered too You gave me a divorce and severed your relationship with me But you didn't give me even one opportunity to explain l didn't say a word then, Pooja... because l thought you were very angry And your anger was justified But you're still as angry and obstinate as ever You have no place for me in your heart One mistake, even God forgives So go and seek forgiveness from God! l can't forgive you.

Save my skin! You want me to sing? - Yes So everybody else runs away? - Oh no Ask one of the guests, producer One of them must undoubtedly have feeling in his voice Why don't you sing, Sardarji? - No! The bride will run away! No, we don't want a song in Tamil May l suggest something, Mr Raj? - Go ahead The manager has an amazing voice lf his song doesn't make your wedding greater, nothing will Where is he? - Who's that? But where is he...? Shiv saheb! Here he is Yes? ls everything okay? Yes, everything is okay, but... your secrets are being exposed Pardon me?

Something... that will make me, my guests and my bride... just sway! We must remember nothing except you! What? Me? Yes, you. Know what they call someone who stands by you in such times?

''may you always be happy. l pray for you'' ''l have been in love too'' ''Yes, l have also been in love'' ''Yes, l have been in love'' ''Yes, l have also been in love'' Pooja, come... l'm here to take you along The guests are waiting for you downstairs l have kept my promise l have no complaints or regrets l face no dilemma... that you're leaving Your bridegroom has sent me with so much of love, to fetch you As his best man. As his best friend Something like this must never have happened before Perhaps this is the first time ever... that a man is getting his wife married to someone else lt isn't a nice thing to happen To punish you, l have punished myself Why didn't l forgive you? Despite the love l had for you... why did l deny myself? What am l to do, Shiv? What am l to do? The sacred fire around which we took the vows... now chars my heart! lt won't let me erase your name lt won't let your name be erased Pooja, Raj is waiting for us downstairs His guests are waiting for us. We must go now Come on You knew Shiv and didn't even tell me? You knew each other... and l didn't even get to know? ls he the man you were married to? ls he the man you have never been able to forget? So he's the one you loved with all your heart He's the one you wanted to punish, and ended up punishing yourself This story began between the two of you Will you decide its conclusion now? Or must l do it? l'm told it's difficult for lovers to get together As far as l know and feel... l think the two of you are made for each other What is right and what is wrong, what's true and what's not... who ought to be punished, who should be forgiven...? mere mortals like us can not decide But yes, if there is anything that can decide it... it's the vows you take to remain together for seven lifetimes And every vow you take together. Which you can't forget so easily lt's true, Pooja. That's just why you couldn't move any further Your eyes could never see the truth behind the norms You can't love anyone but Shiv Pooja, signatures on a piece of paper don't make or break relationships The name you write on your heart... you can never erase in a lifetime And there's just one name in your heart. Shiv's When you severed your relationship... there was no one to stop you or reason with you And see where it has taken the two of you Only the fortunate ones have someone to lead you by hand l'll show you the way ou could never understand l'll restore for good, this relationship that had broken l hope you had a comfortable stay and a successful conference What are you doing here? You're the one who's surprising me! lt's seven years since we last met Seven years? We studied together in college He was always busy with his studies and sports Now that l see you, l realise that he had a great eye for women He reserved it for you l'm here for a conference You will eat, won't you? Shall we go?
