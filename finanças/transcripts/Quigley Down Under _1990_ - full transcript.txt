I OUGHTA WASH YOUR MOUTH OUT WITH SOAP IF I HAD SOME. LADY, YOU ARE ABOUT A HALF A BUBBLE OFF OF PLUMB. AND THAT'S FOR SURE AND FOR CERTAIN. JUST BECAUSE THE ROAD IS ROCKY DOESN'T MEAN YOUR SPIRITS SHOULD GET ROCKY, TOO. WHEN DO WE GET TO MARSTON'S RANCH? WE'VE BEEN ON HIS BLOODY LAND FOR THE LAST 2 DAYS. HEY! THINGS SEEM DIFFERENT HERE. THEY SAY GOD MADE AUSTRALIA LAST DON'T YOU KNOW? AFTER HE GOT TIRED OF MAKING EVERYTHING ELSE THE SAME. WELL, I SEEN SOME PRETTY COUNTRY, THAT'S FOR CERTAIN. WHAT ARE YOU DOING SO FAR FROM HOME? THERE HASN'T BEEN ANYONE ELSE BUT YOU. YOU KNOW THAT, DON'T YOU? YOU CAN TAKE ME IF YOU WANT TO, ROY. GOD ALMIGHTY, LADY. GO TO SLEEP. LOOK AT THAT, MATE. WHOO-HOO! WAIT TILL YOU SEE WHAT WE'VE GOT FOR YOU, O'FLYNN. MATTHEW QUIGLEY. ELLIOTT MARSTON. WELCOME TO AUSTRALIA. WELL, SIR, YOUR MEN ALREADY WELCOMED ME. COOGAN, MR. QUIGLEY'S LUGGAGE, TAKE IT TO THE LODGE. MR. MARSTON, YOU SAID YOU'D PAY ME $50 IN GOLD COIN JUST FOR SHOWING UP. YOU DON'T WASTE MUCH TIME. I SPENT 3 MONTHS ON A BOAT JUST GETTING HERE. YOU INTRIGUED ME, MR. QUIGLEY. 21 MEN ANSWERED MY ADVERTISEMENT FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD. CANADA, INDIA, ENGLAND. THEY JUST WROTE LETTERS. BUT YOU HAD A WAY WITH WORDS. MY ADVERTISEMENT SIMPLY STATED THAT I WANTED TO HIRE THE FINEST LONG-DISTANCE MARKSMAN IN THE WORLD. HAVE I? AAH. THE LEGENDARY SHARP. YOU KNOW YOUR WEAPONS. IT'S A LEVER-ACTION BREECHLOADER. USUAL BARREL LENGTH IS 30 INCHES. THIS ONE HAS AN EXTRA 4. IT'S CONVERTED TO USE A SPECIAL .45 CALIBER, 110-GRAIN METAL CARTRIDGE WITH A 540-GRAIN PAPER PATCHED BULLET. IT'S FITTED WITH DOUBLE-SET TRIGGERS AND A VERNIER SIGHT. IT'S MARKED UP TO 1,200 YARDS. THIS ONE SHOOTS A MIGHT FURTHER. AN EXPERIMENTAL WEAPON WITH EXPERIMENTAL AMMUNITION. YOU COULD CALL IT THAT. LET'S EXPERIMENT. WHITEY, TAKE THAT BUCKET AND RIDE OUT UNTIL I SIGNAL. TELL ME WHEN YOU WANT HIM TO STOP. YOUR MAN ABLE TO HIT SOMETHING THAT FAR AWAY? I DON'T KNOW HIM. I NEVER SAW HIM BEFORE. HE'D HAVE TO BE A GOOD SHOT, ALL RIGHT. 'BOUT THERE'LL DO. BULLSHIT. ARE YOU QUITE CERTAIN, MR. QUIGLEY THAT YOU WOULDN'T LIKE THE BUCKET A BIT CLOSER? OH! JESUS CHRIST! QUITE CERTAIN. TOLD YOU. ONLY MY ROY COULD HIT A COYOTE FROM THAT DISTANCE. VERY IMPRESSIVE. YOU'RE HIRED. WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME FOR A MINUTE? THERE'S SOME BUSINESS I HAVE TO ATTEND TO. YOU MIGHT FIND THIS INTERESTING. NICE SHOOTING, ROY. MR. MARSTON. I THINK THERE'S BEEN A MISTAKE. THE ONE THEY CALL "CRAZY CORA"? GRR. I'D APPRECIATE IT IF YOUR MEN WOULD LEAVE HER ALONE TILL YOU AND I HAVE A CHANCE TO TALK. WHATEVER YOU WANT. YOU ARE DESERTERS FROM HER MAJESTY'S ARMED FORCES. THE PENALTY FOR YOUR CRIME IS DEATH. PLUS, YOU WERE CAUGHT ON MY LAND. I COULD HAVE YOU SHOT FOR TRESPASSING. YOU LET US STAY HERE, GOVERNOR, WE'LL SERVE YOU PROPER. BETTER THAN THIS CONVICT SCUM YOU'VE GOT. WELL, UNFORTUNATELY YOUR COMMANDING OFFICER MAJOR ASHLEY-PITT AND I, HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING. AND SO I'M AFRAID YOU'LL BE SENT BACK TO FACE THE FIRING PARTY. BUT I SEE NO REASON WHY YOU SHOULD BE TRUSSED UP LIKE ANIMALS. MR. DOBKIN. THIS IS MY PREFERRED WEAPON, MR. QUIGLEY. DO JOIN ME FOR DINNER. YOU GOTTA ADMIT THE YANK'S A GOOD SHOT WITH A LONG RIFLE. SURE. BUT YOU GIVE ME A WEAPON LIKE THAT AND I COULD BEAT HIM WITH MY EYES SHUT. EASY TO SAY, O'FLYNN BUT YOU'VE GOT A LOT TO LEARN. I'VE GOT A LOT TO LEARN? WELL, LOOK AT YOU, THEN, DOBKIN. YOU BEEN HERE 12 YEARS AND ALL YOU'VE GOT TO SHOW FOR IT IS COLD MUTTON. HE'S IN GETTING A FANCY DINNER. HUH? YOU WERE ACTUALLY IN DODGE CITY? WILLIAM HICKOK MUST HAVE BEEN THERE. OH, SPENT A NIGHT THERE ONCE. I WAS PRETTY TIRED. DODGE CITY'S A NICE PLACE TO GET SOME SLEEP. YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE ARMY REVOLVER, MR. QUIGLEY? WELL, SIR. I NEVER HAD MUCH USE FOR ONE. IT'S A RECENT INVENTION OF YOUR COUNTRYMAN, COLONEL COLT. GOD CREATED ALL MEN. THEY SAY SAM COLT MADE THEM EQUAL... MORE OR LESS. HA HA HA. YOU SEE, THAT'S WHAT I LIKE ABOUT YOU AMERICANS. YOU'RE PEOPLE OF ACTION, NOT WORDS. THAT MINT JELLY ON YOUR LAMB... IS MY OWN CREATION. I'M A STUDENT OF YOUR AMERICAN WEST. I'VE READ A GREAT DEAL ABOUT IT. TELL ME ABOUT DINGOES. 10 POUNDS A MONTH SHOOTING WILD DOGS SEEMS LIKE A WHOLE LOT FOR NOT MUCH. BESIDES, YOU'VE GOT ENOUGH MEN AND GUNS OUTSIDE TO KILL EVERY DINGO WITHIN 10 MILES OF HERE. UNLESS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT DESERTERS. DID YOU KNOW THAT YOUR AMERICAN INDIAN IS A RACE THAT HAS NO WORD FOR "WHEEL"? NO CONCEPT OF FARMING, NO UNDERSTANDING OF LAND OWNERSHIP. IS THAT A FACT? FROM WHAT I HEAR YOU FOUND A SOLUTION TO THAT PROBLEM IN YOUR COUNTRY. I GUESS THAT DEPENDS ON WHETHER YOU'RE AN INDIAN OR NOT. YOU SEE, IN MANY WAYS OUR 2 NATIONS ARE QUITE SIMILAR. WE BOTH BROUGHT CIVILIZATION TO THE STONE AGE. UNFORTUNATELY, IN THIS COUNTRY WE HAVE FAILED IN ONE REGARD. WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DOMESTICATE THE MOST BACKWARD PEOPLE IN THE WORLD: THE AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINE. DON'T MIND HIM, HE'S HARMLESS. MY PARENTS WERE SLAUGHTERED BY ABORIGINES, MR. QUIGLEY. THEY ATTACKED SO FAST MY MOTHER WAS FOUND DEAD STILL HOLDING HER SEWING. NOWADAYS, THEY BUTCHER OUR SHEEP AND CATTLE. HER MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT ALLOWS THE LOCAL SETTLERS TO DEAL WITH THE MATTER THEIR OWN WAY. THIS OFFICIAL POLICY IS CALLED "PACIFICATION BY FORCE." BUT THE REAL ISSUE IS THAT PRIMITIVE AS THEY ARE THE ABORIGINES HAVE LEARNED TO KEEP OUT OF OUR RIFLE RANGE. WHICH BRINGS US TO YOU MR. QUIGLEY. WHAT THE HELL? NOW STAY RIGHT WHERE YOU WERE. NO MAN KNOCKS ME OUT OF MY OWN HOUSE. WELL DON'T JUST STAND THERE, GET HIM. HAS HE GOT THE RIFLE WITH HIM? HE KEEPS IT RIGHT BESIDE HIM. I SAID GET HIM! HE'S JUST SITTING IN THERE WITH THAT BIG GUN. KEEP DOWN. KELLY, UP THERE. CARVER, TAKE THE SIDE. RUFFY, AROUND THE BACK. FANCY AMERICAN, HEY? HE'S REAL FANCY, EH? KICK HIM IN THE BACK! THAT'S IT! HA HA. LEAVE ROY ALONE! UGH! GET HER OFF ME! AHH! AHH! THROW HIM IN THE WAGON HAUL HIM 2 DAYS FROM HERE AND DUMP HIM. LET AUSTRALIA KILL HIM. AND THE CRAZY WOMAN, TOO! FORGOT THE GOLD. WHAT DID HE SAY? YOU FORGOT THE GOLD. MARSTON. WELL, HE PAID HIM IN GOLD. HE'S RIGHT. LEAVE US SOME WATER AND YOU CAN HAVE THE GOLD. I CAN HAVE THE GOLD ANYWAY. THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT YOU'D SAY. UGH! HYAH! HYAH! UNH! UHH! HYAH! HYAH! HYAH! HYAH! UH. I WISH PEOPLE WOULD QUIT HITTING ME ON THE HEAD. DON'T WORRY. ON A NEW JOB IT'S QUITE COMMON FOR THINGS NOT TO GO WELL AT FIRST. HEH HEH. HA HA HA. HA HA HA. WE SHOULD... WHAT? I REMEMBER ONCE MY GRANDDADDY TOLD ME ABOUT HOW WHEN YOU'RE LOST IN THE DESERT YOU SHOULD SLEEP DURING THE DAY AND WALK AT NIGHT. YOUR GRANDDADDY TELL YOU THAT? HE ALSO TELL YOU WE'LL DIE IN THE DESERT WITHOUT THOSE HORSES? WELL, WHAT GOOD ARE HORSES IF WE DIE FIRST? ONCE IN A WHILE SHE ACTUALLY MAKES A LITTLE SENSE. WHAT DID YOU SAY, ROY? NEVER MIND. UNH! UNH! GOOD MORNING, MAJOR. MARSTON. WHAT CAN I GET FOR YOU? SOME REFRESHMENT? THAT'S VERY KIND, SIR. I'D BE OBLIGED IF YOU WOULD IDENTIFY FOR ME 2 DEAD BODIES. 2 MEN ABSCONDED. BUT I IMAGINE THIS IS A COUPLE OF NEWCOMERS WHO WANDERED OFF TOGETHER RECENTLY. A MAN AND A WOMAN? NAH. 2 MEN. ONE OF THEM STABBED AND ONE SHOT THROUGH THE HEAD. COOGAN AND MILLER. WELL, IT WOULD APPEAR THE MAN AND WOMAN ARE STILL MISSING. YES, IT WOULD, WOULDN'T IT? OH, DON'T WORRY, MAJOR. I HAVE NO DOUBT I'LL FIND THEM. ♪ ♪ ♪ HEY, LADY. YOU OKAY? THINK SO. WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO TO US? I RECKON THEY ALREADY DONE IT. THEY GAVE US WATER. BUT THAT DON'T MAKE SENSE. THEY LET ME KEEP IT WHEN EVERY WHITE MAN WITH A RIFLE IS TRYING TO KILL THEM. EXCEPT YOU. WELL, THEY DON'T KNOW THAT. DON'T THEY? SOMETHING TELLS ME YOU AND I WERE ON THE SHADY SIDE OF DEAD. THIS IS A SPECIAL PLACE. BET THEY USED MAGIC ON US. THAT OLD MAN OVER THERE LOOKS LIKE HE'S SOME KIND OF CHIEF OR MEDICINE MAN OR SOMETHING. WHAT'S THIS? THAT. MORE THAN LIKELY SOMETHING THAT CAME OUT OF THE SOUTH END OF A NORTHBOUND KANGAROO. YOU MEAN KANGAROO SHIT? VERY KIND. YOU THINK THEY'RE SAFE TO EAT? YOU GOT A BETTER IDEA? MUCH OBLIGED. GO ON. I DON'T EAT THINGS THAT ARE STILL MOVING. YOU GOING TO SHOOT IT FIRST? MMM. YO? YO? YO? YO! YO! YO! WATER? MEGMA. MEGMA? NOW, I'LL HELP YOU CUT THIS... THIS STRIP OUT OF THIS BIG PIECE OF KANGAROO. THERE WE GO. TAKE IT. MY WORK. HERE. OVER LIKE THAT. SWING YOUR ARM. ROLL YOUR WRIST. SEE, YOU GOTTA KEEP THAT LOOP OPEN. SEE HOW THAT LOOP STAYS OPEN? AND YOU LOOK AT WHAT YOU'RE THROWING AT, SWING THE ROPE, AND THROW RIGHT AT IT. THEN YOU JUST PULL HIM IN. ♪ 'NIGHT. YOU JUST WAIT TILL YOU TRY THIS. BUT YOU GOT TO GUESS WHAT IT IS. THAT LITTLE GIRL IS SO DARLING. SHE SURE IS. NOT AS DARLING AS ROY JR. AW, GOD ALMIGHTY, LADY, NOT ANOTHER ROY. WELL, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT MY STOMACH THINKS MY THROAT'S BEEN CUT. ROY WAS HUNTING SAGE HENS WHEN THE COMANCHES CAME. I GRABBED THE BABY AND A PISTOL AND I... HID IN THE ROOT CELLAR OUT BACK. AND THE INDIANS TORE UP OUR SOD HOUSE AND I WAS REAL QUIET BUT THEN THE BABY STARTED CRYING. I TRIED TO SHUSH HIM AND SUCKLE HIM BUT HE JUST WOULDN'T STOP. ONE COMANCHE, I REMEMBER, HE ACTED REAL DRUNK AND WORE MY GREEN APRON. HE MUST HAVE HEARD SOMETHING. HE STARTED HOLLERING AND COMING CLOSER. SO I PUT MY HAND GENTLE-LIKE OVER MY BABY'S MOUTH. "DON'T CRY. "DADDY WILL BE HOME SOON." THE INDIANS FOUND US, BUT THEY JUST LAUGHED. THEY WERE JUST DRUNK. THEY DIDN'T WANT TO HURT ANYBODY. THEY RODE AWAY AND AT SUNDOWN, ROY CAME HOME, BUT I WAS STILL AFRAID TO COME OUT OF THE CELLAR. I WAS AFRAID OF WHAT HE'D DO WHEN HE SAW I SMOTHERED OUR SON. I OUGHT TO FIND SOME WAY TO MEND THIS PETTICOAT. LOOK AT THAT. ROY. HE JUST BURIED THE BABY PUT ME IN THE WAGON AND WE WENT 70 MILES TO GALVESTON WITHOUT STOPPING. HE NEVER SAID A WORD. PUT ME ON THE FIRST SHIP HE FOUND. IT WAS HEADED TO AUSTRALIA. AND HE SAID, "DON'T WANT NO WOMAN "THAT WOULD KILL MY SON TO SAVE HERSELF." AND HE TURNED AND HE WALKED AWAY AND HE NEVER LOOKED BACK. I KNOW 'CAUSE I WATCHED TO SEE IF HE WOULD. THIS THING IS JUST FALLING APART. IT'S JUST... I'M TIRED. DON'T EXACTLY TALK YOUR EAR OFF SAYING GOODBYE, DO THEY? THE JOHNSONS ARE ALWAYS LIKE THAT. WHAT? REMEMBER THE CHURCH SOCIAL LAST YEAR? THEY ATE EVERYBODY'S JAMS AND PIES AND LEFT WITHOUT SAYING A WORD. WELL, IT'S YOUR OWN FAULT FOR INVITING THEM AGAIN THIS YEAR. WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT? THAT'S WHY. GOD, NO. NO! DON'T! STAY BACK! NO! OVER THERE! NO! NO! SHIT. NO! OF ALL THE DAMN FOOL THINGS I EVER DID SEE. YOU TRYING TO GET YOUR HEAD BLOWN OFF? ANYONE WHO BELIEVES IN MAGIC IS CRAZY. DON'T BE RUNNING OFF LIKE THAT. I COULD'VE USED SOME HELP UP THERE, YOU KNOW. WELL, I GOT MY RIG BACK. BUT NO SADDLEBAGS, WHICH MEANS I CAN'T MAKE MY RELOAD. WE GOT 1 HORSE AND 2 CANTEENS. A RIDER GOT AWAY, WHICH MEANS MARSTON WILL KNOW WHERE WE ARE. YEAH, AND WE DON'T. I'M COLD. YOU GOT THE BLANKET. WELL, MAYBE WE COULD SHARE IT TONIGHT. THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT. IF WE DO, THERE WILL BE SOMETHING I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT. WHEN SUMMER COMES, LET'S DRAG UP SOME WOOD FOR A REAL CABIN. 'CAUSE, ROY, SOD WALLS... MATTHEW. MATTHEW QUIGLEY. I AIN'T SHARING MY BED TILL I'M CERTAIN YOU KNOW WHO'S IN IT. NOW, SAY IT. IF WE HAD A WOOD CABIN, WE COULD GET GLASS WINDOWS. WE'LL SEE. SEA'S GOT TO BE WEST AND THAT'S HOW WE'RE HEADED, BUT SURE WOULDN'T KNOW IT. OW! HELL! DID YOU SEE THAT? I SURE DID. BIGGEST ANT I EVER DID SEE. WHAT'S MY NAME TODAY? MATTHEW QUIGLEY, SAME AS ON THE OTHER DAY. HOW'S ABOUT YOU AND ME TAKING OFF ALL OUR CLOTHES AND GOING SWIMMING? WHAT ARE YOU, CRAZY? THERE AIN'T NO WATER. WHY, SHAME ON YOU. WELL, YOU...

OH, BY THE WAY, YOU'RE FIRED. THIS AIN'T DODGE CITY AND YOU AIN'T BILL HICKOK. SAID I NEVER HAD MUCH USE FOR ONE. NEVER SAID I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO USE IT. SOMEWHAT THE WORSE FOR WEAR. THIS APPEARS TO BE QUIGLEY. I THINK YOU HAVE A LOT TO EXPLAIN, SIR, NOT THAT IT WILL DO YOU ANY GOOD. SERGEANT. "IN PURSUANCE OF A WARRANT, "DULY ATTESTED BY A JUSTICE OF THE PEACE, "YOU ARE HEREBY CHARGED "WITH NUMEROUS AND SERIOUS CRIMES, "INCLUDING MURDER..." IN SHORT, THIS PAPERWORK SAYS WE CAN HANG YOU. I AIN'T GOING TO SWING ON NO GALLOWS. WELL, YOU CAN ALWAYS BE SHOT ON THE WAY TO YOUR TRIAL, WHILE TRYING TO ESCAPE, OF COURSE. OR YOU CAN DIE RIGHT HERE, BEARING ARMS AGAINST THE ARMY OF HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN. WELL, THE DECISION... WHEN'S THE NEXT BOAT LEAVING? FOR EUROPE OR THE AMERICAS? AMERICA. LET'S SEE HERE. WELL, I'VE GOT ONE LEAVING THIS AFTERNOON FOR SAN FRANCISCO. AND YOUR NAME, SIR? NAME? ROY. ROY COBB. HOW MANY? 2. I GOT SOMETHING I WANT TO SAY TO YOU. WELL, I GOT A COUPLE OF THINGS I WANT TO SAY TO YOU, TOO. REMEMBER ONCE YOU TOLD ME, BEFORE YOU'D MAKE LOVE TO ME, I HAD TO SAY 2 WORDS? WHAT'S THAT? MATTHEW QUIGLEY.
