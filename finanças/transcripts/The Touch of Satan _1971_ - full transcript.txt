(crickets chirping) (cowbell ringing) (suspenseful music) - Oh that dirty old trick works every time. Oh my. Oh! Come on girl. Don't stop now. I've already missed my tea. Come on now, come on. Whew, must be getting old. Mercy, if you'd come in like the rest of 'em there wouldn't be all of this chasing. Oh, I can tell by the look in your eye you like all of the fussing. Well just stand there like a good girl. Now what did I do with that darn pitchfork? I know I left it in here someplace. (cries out softly) Alright, who's in here? Is that you, Robert? You're supposed to be in bed, you little rascal. Now whoever you are, you better come out here. (dramatic music) (groaning) (cries out) (laughing) - I guess we shouldn't laugh about it. He might have been hurt. - Oh no, he's hard as a rock. - Anybody want anymore coffee? I'll heat it up. - No thanks, not for me. I'm going in to watch the late news and go to bed. - Me either. (banging) - [Luther] Pete's sake, what is that? What's going on out there? Lucinda! Get her in here! (sobbing) - [Molly] Oh my god, what is it, what's the matter? - What happened, what have you done? - It's alright. Stop it. - Oh look at the blood. - I'll take her upstairs. (babbling) Come on dear, come on. - He's done it again. - Oh we don't know. - [Melissa] Don't we? - [Luther] Oh it's been years! - And before that nine and before that and-- - Oh please, Melissa. - I've gotta do something. This torment can't last forever. - You know that it can. - No. There's a way. (dramatic music) - Nice looking town you've got here. - Yeah, well don't let that fool you none. More going on here than meets the eye. - No kidding, like what? - Like murder, brother, like murder. - Murder? - Yessiree bob. Farmer down the road got killed in his barn by a pitchfork. Happened a little over a week ago. - They catch the guy yet? - No. For my money they won't either. That'll be $6 even. See the way I got it figured, this job was done by one of them fromacidal maniacs. And we ain't got none of them around here. Stamps? - No thanks. (honking) - Yep, long gone by now. They won't catch him until he kills again. - Hope you're right. Nobody needs, what did you call him? - Fromacidal maniac. - Yeah well nobody needs a fromacidal maniac hanging around. - Yeah. (laughing) (mysterious music) (splashing) (laughing) - This your pond? - Belongs to my father. - Oh, does your father mind if people skip rocks across his pond? - I don't think he's ever mentioned it. - Oh. Do you want half a sandwich? - No. But don't let me stop you. That your car? - Mm hmm. - Pretty car. - Thanks. What's your name? - Melissa Strickland. - Mine's Jodie. Jodie Lee Thompson. Only I don't care for the Lee very much. - Hello. - Hi. (soda can pops and fizzes) - What are you doing down by our pond, Jodie? - Lunch. - You on a journey? - Yes, I guess so. I'm not going anyplace special. You're pretty, you know that? - Yes, I guess so. - [Jodie] I bet you have nine boyfriends. - No. - Six. - No! None. - You're putting me on, how come? - Well, it's just that we live on a farm. - It's none of my business anyway. What kind of a farm? - We grow walnuts mostly. - Walnuts, huh? Well I've never been on a walnut ranch. (mysterious music) What's the matter? - Nothing. I was just wondering, would you like to come up and see it? - The ranch? Why? - Well you said you'd never been on one and since you're not going anyplace special-- - Add to my general fund of knowledge, hmm? Well will you give me a walnut? - Yes. Maybe two. - Well you can't beat that, let's go. (roosters crowing) - Mother! This is Jodie. - Hello. - [Melissa] He's just passing through, Mama. - Hello Jodie. Supper'll be ready directly. You look like you could do with something besides a chili dog for a change. - Well you're right about that. - Sit right over there. - Thank you. - Melissa go get your father and tell him we've got company. She's a pretty girl, isn't she? - Yes ma'am she is. - Where'd she find you? - Down by the pond. - By the pond? (roosters crowing) - What is it? - We have company for supper. - Company, who? - Nobody you know, just a boy I met down by the pond. - A boy you met? You brought him to the house? - Yes I did, he's nice. I just wanna talk to him, that's all. - Melissa, you don't have the right. - The right? The right to what, to talk to someone? Now don't get so excited, he's just passing through. He'll be gone soon. - Is that all there is to it? Is it? You didn't call him, did you? (mysterious music) - No. I tell you, it's alright. - What about Lucinda? - She can eat in her room, now come on up to the house. And be nice to him. - So you're just passing through. - [Jodie] Yes ma'am. - Daddy, this is Jodie Thompson. - Hello Jodie. - How do you do? - You hungry? I could eat a horse! - Yeah, I guess I could too. - [Luther] Good, we'll have a drink on that. - Now Jodie, there won't be any hard feelings if you don't want any of that. - Oh bosh! You'll love this stuff! Best darn cider in the whole country. (laughs) I make it myself. I put peanuts in it. Smooths out the taste. Man that's good! Mm! Supper ready? - Just about. Wash up everybody. - So I may stay in San Francisco for a while or I might go all the way down to LA. I've got a friend there who says he can get me a job. - Do you enjoy traveling around the country like this, Jodie? - Yes ma'am. You know there's so much to see. And I've met a lot of really nice people. Just like you folks. And may I say that that was just about the best dinner I've had since I left home. - Well thank you. Thank you very much. - You know there's something else I've learned as I've been bumming around the country. People are pretty much the same, after you get the know them anyway. Maine or Texas, it doesn't seem to make any difference. I think that's encouraging, don't you? - Yeah. Yeah I guess you're right. Tell me Jodie. You think you'll ever stop bumming around? - Sure I will, Mr. Strickland, as soon as the excitement wears off. Or I find something I really want. You know I gave a lot of thought to this before I did it. I just didn't jump up and run. - Well it sounds like you know what you're about, son. Hey. How about another little drink of my cider? - No thank you. Besides I've got to get back on the road. - No, why don't you wait until morning? (mysterious music) The highway's gonna be foggy tonight. - Melissa, if Jodie wants to leave we really shouldn't try to keep him. - Yes Melissa. If he has to get to San Francisco... - Well I'm in no hurry, I just don't want to strain your hospitality. - Don't be silly, it's no strain. And besides, we've got a spare room. You can be off first thing in the morning. - Well I hate to be any more trouble. - It's no trouble at all. Is it, Mother? - Of course not. I'll fix up the sewing room. - I'll go with you in case you need any help. - Well I sure appreciate it. - Don't say anything more about it. You and I can pick up the dishes and then we'll go for a walk. - Do you like living out here like this in the country? - I suppose so. It's the only way I've ever lived. - Didn't you ever wanna do something different? - Like what? - Oh, I don't know, just something different. - Not everyone can be like you, you know. You're lucky. - Yeah, yeah I guess I am. - What's it like? - What? - Being able to do exactly what you wanna do every single day? - It's exciting. - Exciting. - Yes, why do you think I turned down your road today? - Why did you? (gentle music) - 'Cause I wanted to see what was at the other end. And I got lucky because you were there. - This is where the fish lives. - Why did you run? - Felt like it. I really wanted to fly but I couldn't do that so I ran. Tell me about yourself. Who you are, all of that. - Well, my father's a Russian count. And when the Bolsheviks came in-- - Stop it. - You don't believe that? - No. - Well it could be true. - Stop it. - Okay. My father's a lawyer. And he wants me to be a lawyer too. I told him I didn't know yet, that I wanted to go out and poke around the country for a while. So he gave me the car, 300 bucks, and a handshake and here I am. - Do you let him know what you're doing? - Sure I do, I think he'd like to be with me. - He sounds like a nice man. - Yes, he's a very nice man. (gentle music) You know I like you. I did right away. You like me too, don't you? Don't you? - Uh huh. - Ah. Funny, isn't it? I wonder what causes a thing like that. - [Melissa] Maybe I hexed you. - You mean put the whammy on me? - Maybe. - Nope, not me. - Will you stay here a few days? - Huh? - Stay here with me. (laughs) - Well-- - I'm lonely, Jodie. I need someone to talk to. To share things with. Just for a few days. - I was going to be in San Fran... What about your folks? - Oh Jodie. (laughs) - You know what I mean, would they mind? - No. - Alright. (laughs) - Oh, do you know how long it's been since I felt this good? - Must be at least 50 years. - Let's get up first thing in the morning, we can have the whole day together. (laughing) What's so funny? - You. You are. Come on, let's go. (suspenseful music) (clamoring on television) - Did you have a nice walk? - Yes ma'am. Goodnight. - That's your room. - Bang on my door in the morning? - At six o'clock? - Sure, why not? - Okay. (mysterious music) (squeaking) - Must go away. - Who are you? - Go. (knocking) - Who is it? - It's me. Got to talk to you. - What's the matter? - Is there anybody else in this house that I don't know about? - Lucinda. - She came right in my room and scared the hell out of me. - I'm sorry she frightened you, Jodie. But you mustn't pay any attention to her. She's an old woman and she likes to wander around the house. It won't happen again. - Who is she? - She's my great-grandmother. - What happened to her face? - She was badly burned when she was a young girl. That's why she doesn't go out very much, because of her face. Go back to bed. She was just curious. I'll go talk to her. - Okay. Why did she say go away? - She's afraid of strangers. - She wasn't afraid to come into my room without knocking. - She's an old lady, Jodie! I'm sorry. Go back to bed. - Okay. Goodnight. - Goodnight. (mysterious music) You frightened my friend Jodie. Now listen. You must stay in your room. - Brush, brush. - Do you understand? You must stay in your room. Molly or Luther must have made a mistake and forgot to lock your door. Now if you want me to be nice to you, you must stay in your room even if the door is unlocked. I'm gonna lock the door now. Do you understand? - No Melissa, no, no. - No. - No Melissa. - It's late. You have to go to sleep now. - Melissa. - Tomorrow I'll take you for an extra long walk. - No Melissa no. No Melissa. No Melissa. - Goodnight. My sister. (mysterious music) - No, Melissa, no. (chainsaw rumbling) (goats bleating) - Gotta feed the rabbits now. Empty this first. - He doesn't show any signs of leaving, does he? - He'd better leave. (roosters crowing) - Oh come on. Simmer down. He might be the right one. - Molly. Molly it's taking such a terrible chance. - Don't you think she deserves the chance? Look Luther. You've got to see a little more of Melissa's side of it. Look at all those years. The torment she's had. I think she's doing the right thing. And I think we oughta help her. Look if that boy's not the right one, she'll know it. - What else are we going to do today, hmm? - Would you mind driving me to town so I can go to the store? - Sure. - I'll go change and tell them we're leaving. Meet me at the car. - Okay. - I asked Jodie to stay a few days and he agreed. - We figured you would. - Jodie's gonna drive me to the store. - [Luther] Does she know everything we need? - [Molly] Yes. - I said Jodie's agreed to stay a few days. - [Luther] We heard you the first time. - And it's alright with you? - No it's not alright with me, but it's your decision, not mine. - That means a great deal to me, Luther. (roosters crowing) Thank you. - Go to the store. Melissa. What are you gonna tell him? - I dunno. I'll have to wait and see. (mysterious music) - Ready to go? - Yeah, let's go. (doorbell rings) - Well, hello Mr. Mason. - Howdy Mrs. Strickland. Luther around? - I believe he's around in the back. - You mind if I wander back there? - Of course not. - Thank you ma'am. - [Molly] There's not anything wrong, I hope. - Oh no Mrs. Strickland, I just wanna chew the fat with Luther for a while. I'll be seeing you. - Well hello John, what brings you out this way? - Oh, nothing much, just kinda poking around. - Sit down, take a load off. (roosters crowing) - Thank you. Luther, doesn't the back of your place butt up against Old Man Larson's property? - It sure does. You still working on that Larson business? - Harris Tomley's still got his wind up. Thinks if we can break this thing he'll be reelected sheriff for the next 20 years. Damn fool. He's running around over in Newport like he thought he was J. Edgar Hoover. - How can I help? - You mind if I just take a look around your place? (goats bleating) - [Luther] Course not. What are you looking for? - Hell, I don't know. Ain't found nothing yet. Not even a suspicious-looking cow chip. Looks like whoever killed the old man went up in a puff of smoke. - I see. So you don't have any idea at all who might have done this. - Nope, nothing. That's why we're all just out poking around. Guess the sheriff hopes we'll find a signed confession just laying in the grass. - Well help yourself to my place, John. Take all the time you want. - Thanks a lot, Luther. I appreciate that. - Listen. You get through poking around come on up to the house, we'll have a touch of my cider. - I knew you were gonna say that, Luther. But if Sheriff Tomley finds out I was drinking your cider I may have to start working for a living. Thanks anyway Luther, I'll see you in town. - Two, three? (laughing) (bell rings) - Morning Mr. Gentry. - Hello Melissa. (murmuring) - What's the matter with these people? You'd think we had the plague or something. - It's not you, it's just me. They always behave that way. - Well why? - They say in this town that I'm a witch. (scoffs) - A witch? Here. - See what I mean? - Why do they think you're a witch? - Because I am. - Oh, stop it. - You don't believe me, ask 'em. (cash register rings) - Thank you, Melissa. - You're welcome. (murmuring) - Zap! - Young whippersnappers. - Where's he from? - Why'd you do that? - Serves 'em right. - You just made it worse doing a silly thing like that. - I'm sorry Melissa but that sort of thing bugs me. - Come on, let's go. (mysterious music) - You really do believe you are a witch, don't you? - Yes. - There's no such thing as witches. I mean real witches. - Real witches. - Yeah, you know. The kind they burn. What's the matter? - Would you like to see where I do my witchcraft? - Yeah, I guess so. - Okay, I'll show you where to turn. (gentle music) This is it. - It doesn't look very forbidding. - Why should it be forbidding? - Well if this is where you do your witchcraft. Just what kind of witchcraft do you do, huh? (laughs) - Oh I witch the birds into singing and the sun into coming out, making everything look the way it looks. - You're a very lovely witch. - Come on. (laughs) (suspenseful music) Take a look inside. ("Amazing Grace" instrumental) Go on in. - Your own place. Come in here and shut the door and leave the world out there somewhere. - [Melissa] Do you like to turn off the world sometimes? - No. No, I'm afraid I might miss something. You do though, don't you? - Yes. Sometimes. - Well? - Well what? - Do some witch things. - What would you like me to do? - Make me disappear. (laughs) - I wouldn't like to do that. - Make somebody appear then. (laughing) - Hello there. - Is Lucinda out again? She wandered into Jodie's room last night, scared him half to death. - We'll help you look for her. - No, you stay here. Stay here. Have a good time. - Poor Lucinda. I'm the only one she feels comfortable with. Except her doll. - Mm. It's sad, really is. What's in the chest? - I'll show you. (birds chirping) - [Jodie] What's the matter? - I'm not sure. Will you take me home please? - Sure. - Unit one, this is unit four, over. Unit one, this is unit four, over. (suspenseful music) Unit one or unit three, do you read? - [Doll] Mama, mama! (groaning) (shouting) - Lucinda! Lucinda! Be calm. Be calm. (crying) (roosters crowing) - Melissa. (babbling) (retching) Melissa. - Go inside with Molly, go ahead, go on. Go on. (retching) (roosters crowing) (whooshing) - Molly! Molly get on out here! Molly, where are you? Molly! (engine rumbling) Molly, where are you? Molly, will you get out here? Molly! Molly, where are you, come here! Molly, for goodness sakes! Is Lucinda locked up in her room? - [Molly] Yes, I locked it. - Alright now look I've got to get good strong lock for that room so she can't get out again. Now I want you to follow me in the pickup truck and for Pete's sake drive carefully, we don't wanna be stopped. - [Molly] Alright, where are the keys? - [Luther] The keys are in the truck. - [Molly] What about Melissa? - [Luther] Oh we can't worry about Melissa now! Hurry up now, follow me and be careful! (mysterious music) - [Jodie] Why do you think I turned down your road today? - [Melissa] Why did you? - [Jodie] Because I wanted to see what was at the other end and I got lucky because you were there. - [Melissa] They say in this town that I'm a witch. - [Attendant] They won't find him til they kills again. - [Melissa] She doesn't go out much because of her face. Will you stay with me a few days? Stay here with me. I'm lonely, Jodie. I'm lonely, Jodie. I need someone to talk to. I need someone to talk to. To share things with, just for a few days. - What are they going to do about me? - I don't know. Will you stay here until tomorrow? - I don't seem to have any choice. - Luther'll unlock that as soon as he gets back. - He trust me not to run off? - He'll do what I say. Believe me. - Listen, that old woman, the way she-- - Just give us until tomorrow. Please? - And what good will that do? It won't change anything. - Maybe I can find a way for you to understand. - Oh I understand. I understand enough to know that if you'd gone to that sheriff 10 days ago, that deputy would still be alive. She killed that farmer too, didn't she? Didn't she? It's wrong, Melissa. Luther and Molly and you are wrong. - We're cursed. - No. - We are cursed. - You believe that? You really do believe it. - Yes. - If I stay until tomorrow will you go away with me? - Where? - To the sheriff, and then after that away from here. Maybe back to Austin with me. - I can never leave them. - Why? Why Melissa? - What happens to my family is my responsibility. - And why not Luther? It's his family. - You saw Lucinda this afternoon, she barely knows Molly or Luther or anyone exists but me. I saved her. I'm the only one that can reach her. - I don't understand. - Then stay. Just one more day. - Alright. - I'll find a way. - You really do believe there's some, some devil out there? - Oh yes. - I suppose that makes it true. - It is true. - You're just like those people in the store. They believe you're a witch so it's true for them. Well I don't, so you're not. - I'm possessed by the devil. - There's no such thing. - I heard his voice. - No. There is no devil. (suspenseful music) (explosions booming) (door shuts) (wind whistling) (dramatic music) - [Crowd] Burn the witch, burn the witch, burn the witch, burn the witch, burn the witch, burn the witch, burn the witch, burn the witch. - The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor. A dreadful sound is in his ears. In prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him. What is it, child? - Thought I heard something. - Pay attention to the word of God. Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out and the spark of his fire shall not shine. The light shall be dark in his tabernacle and his candle shall be put out with him. - Listen. - [David] Sit back, Lucinda. - They're coming for me. - Calm yourself, sit back. The steps of his strength shall be straightened and his own council cast him down. - [Crowd] Burn the witch, burn the witch-- - For he's cast... - Burn the witch, burn the witch, burn the witch, burn the witch, burn the witch, burn the witch. - For he's cast... - Burn the witch, burn the witch. - Into our net... - Burn the witch, burn the witch, burn the witch, burn the witch, burn the witch, burn the witch, burn the witch. - What is it, David? - Burn the witch, burn the witch, burn the witch, burn the witch, burn the witch, burn the witch. - Papa, what is it? - Burn the witch, burn the witch, burn the witch, burn the witch. - I don't know yet. Take your mother to the back of the house and I'll see what this is about. - [Crowd] Burn the witch, burn the witch, burn the witch, burn the witch. - [David] Good evening, Mr. Keitel. - Mr. Strickland. - What can I do for you? - Ah, Mrs. Loucasta lost her youngun tonight. Only three years old. - I'm sorry to hear that. - Kester Hagen here lost three head of cow tonight and his wife is down sick. - I'm sorry. - It's the plague. - I understand. - The plague has hit near everybody here, David Strickland, but it ain't hit you. Now how do you explain that? - I can only assume that it's God's will. (gasping) - Don't talk to us about God, David Strickland, there's a witch in that house and we aim to have her. - There is no witch in that house. Go on home! - We'll not go home until we get what we come for your daughter is a witch and she's put a hex on us! - [Crowd] Yeah! - That's a damn fool thing to say, Mr. Keitel. Go on home! I'll talk to you tomorrow down at Ben Proctor's store. - [Mr. Keitel] There'll be no talk, we'll have the witch. - Over my dead body! - So be it. (muttering) Come on! - [David] Lucinda, run! (crashing) (screaming) Damn you! Damn you! Oh run Lucinda! - [Lucinda] Oh don't, please don't! No, help, no, you're hurting me! Let go of me! - She hasn't done anything! (screaming) Please! - No, let me down from here, no! Please untie me, let me go! - She hasn't done anything wrong! No, no, no, no! - Help me, let me down from here! - [Melissa] No, let her go! - Oh no, you're making a mistake! Help me, help me Melissa! No, no, oh you're hurting my arms. - [Melissa] No, no! - [Lucinda] Please you're hurting me! - Send her to hell. - Burn the witch.

I felt him inside me. - It's not true. - Face it. I've had to. Do you think I like it? Do you think I've enjoyed all these years with the devil's spirit inside me?
