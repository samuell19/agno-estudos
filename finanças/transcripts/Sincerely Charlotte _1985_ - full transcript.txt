You're the best, you know. Really. - Bernard isn't here? - No. He called, he's not coming. Bummer, he promised! - Come on, Charlotte, I'll buy you a drink. - No, I want to go. Charlotte! Hello, you've reached Bernard Vannier, I'm not available. Please leave a message after the tone. Up you go. You're coming with me to the door, OK? Are you OK? When are you back? Tonight. Are you working all day? All day. Freddy, get in now. Go see mummy. Follow him. It's been four years. Four years and two months. Oh, it's so complicated. Thanks. Drink. I didn't choose anything. - What are you doing? - I'm ready. - We're going back. - It's time. - Shall we go? - Yes, I'm coming. I'm coming at a wrong time. Go, it doesn't matter. I'll be another hour. Can you wait for me here? Yes. Do you want your jacket? No, keep it. I'll be back straightaway. Don't move, Charlie. The lady left. Did she say where she was going? No, she just said you had to pay for the brandies. It's 24 francs. Thanks. Freddy, I told you a thousand times not to play with the violin. Give it to me. Don't tell him off, Mathieu. He's very gifted. - You'll break his vocation. - Food's ready. Mum, can you look after Freddy? Did he break it? - No, but he shouldn't play with it. - You shouldn't leave it here. - Freddy eats the same as us? - Of course. By the way, Mathieu, I forgot to tell you. Someone called you earlier, a woman. She was crying on the phone. She wouldn't say her name. - Ah! - Oh, shit. - Wait, I'll help you. - Leave it. - What time did she call? - At five. - You don't know who it could be? - No. I'm taking this to the workshop, I'll be right back. - Shall I serve you? - Yes, thanks. There was nothing, no electricity, no water... Excuse me. I remembered there was an entrance through the garage. You can't stay here, Charlie. We'll go in and tell Christine that... No, please. There's no need. Tomorrow I'll be gone. Christine is your wife? Yes. If she sees me, we'll have to explain. I can't, I'm too tired. OK, I brought you some food. Thanks, but I'm not hungry. Really? So, aspirin, valium, Temesta. Temesta. What happened to you? It's Bernard. We had a fight and I ran away. I don't want him to find me. I didn't even have money to go to a hotel. Thanks. Are you happy to see me again? Hardly. What do you mean? Not really. It brings back strange memories. We had nice ones. Yes, at first, then there were bad ones. Really bad ones, you know. When you left. Mathieu. Kiss me. Just to say good night. Go to sleep now. It's the best thing to do. Are you sure you don't want to come? They'll be disappointed. There's no one to pick up balls? Don't be silly. - Christine. - Yes? I wanted to tell you that... Mathieu, when you'll be married to Mummy... can I call you Dad? Yes. Come on. What did you want to tell me? I don't remember, it wasn't important. - See you tonight - Bye. Come on. Dear Mathieu... Dear Mathieu, thanks for everything. Sorry if I bothered you. Farewell or see you soon, who knows? Charlotte. Hi. Hello. - Would you like some coffee? - Yes. How long have you been with Christine? Two years. And what does she do? She's a maths teacher. Oh, shit, we're out of gas. It doesn't matter. Funny, your streak of hair. Do you like it? It looks like blood. Do you have a job? I tried some things. Now I sing. Really? Do you remember the Night and Day? You played there. Yes, of course. I sang there, it went down really well. Well done. What's wrong? Nothing, I'm stifling. Give it to me. Did you tell Christine about me? When? Now? No, I mean, generally speaking. Of course. We spent six years together. I'm very happy with Christine. And yet when you left, I almost died. It's strange to want to die for a girl who doesn't love you. Who's this? Shit, it's my student. You're all teachers in the family. It's contagious. Come on, let's hide you. Get in there. Non, at the back. Don't move, OK? Hello, Sir. Hello, Marie-Cécile. Did you practice well this week? I tried to learn the first movement by heart, but it was hard. OK, let's listen to it. Did anything fall? No, it's the cat. Do you have a cat? It's stifling in here, let's go to the big house. It will be cooler. I'm fine here, I'm not hot. I'm stifling. Come on, hurry up. It's funny how you like to contradict. It's not that, but we were fine... Very good, Marie-Cécile. See you next Sunday. - But I didn't play the allegro. - Yes, but it's twelve. It's not twelve, it ten to. OK, the allegro then. You're starting to snoop around. First symptom of a speedy recovery. I'm not snooping around, I'm sorting out. Look. 19 years old, 19 and three quarters, 20, 21, 22 and a half. It's funny that you kept all this. I threw them away. You don't say! Except this one. We were so cute. I couldn't tear it up. Can you give it to me? You already have it. I won't go back there. She was married to a pilot. - Fighter pilot? - No, airline. Handsome guy, a hunk. A cliché. Banging a stewardess at every stopover. After two years, she got fed up. She left when Freddy was born. I love Freddy. If I had a kid, I wish he was like him. Is this today's paper? You're not interested in what I'm saying? I am, I'm captivated. Carry on. Do you love Christine? I do. It's great then. At first, I was fascinated by him. He was very bright. He knew how to entertain me. I had fun with him. And little by little, I realised he was strange. I had the feeling he was lying. And I was staying. Maybe out of curiosity. People who resist you exert an attraction. And then... I wanted to sing. He didn't care. He didn't care about anything that could happen to me. Is that why you left? What am I going to do now? I left everything. I have no more passport, no money. - Go back and get them. - No. It's too dangerous, if he sees me. What can he do? He won't kill you. - You want me to come with you? - Definitely not! Don't look at me. I know you by heart. No, I have changed. You could think I'm less pretty. OK, I'll wait for you in the living room. You've reached Bernard Vannier, I'm not available. Please leave a message... What are you doing? Nothing, I'm coming down. Don't touch me. You know I'm bad. Go away. Charlotte, go away. Get out of here, I don't want to see you again! - I need money. - I'll give you some. THE REVENGE OF HUMANOIDS "None of them will emerge victorious, "but the fight will leave them both greatly affected." And that's it. See you tomorrow. - Sleep well. - No, I don't want to. Yes, you do. Come on. See you tomorrow. Good night. You really want to go to the movies tonight? - Why, are you tired? - A bit, yes. You've done nothing all day and you're beat. I played tennis in the heat and I'm feeling great. - You're a woman. - What's that got to do with it? - Good evening, Irène. - Good evening. Freddy's already asleep, you can watch TV. If you're hungry, have a look in the fridge. - All right. - Have a nice evening. - Goodbye. - Bye. Let's go. What are you doing? Mummy doesn't like it when you rummage through her things. No, I'm throwing things away. These are ugly, you understand? So your mummy told me to throw them in the bin. Come on, go back to bed. What's your name? I'm E.T.'s big sister. Really? Of course! But it's a secret. You shouldn't tell anyone that you saw me. Promised? Promised. Come on. Sleep now. - Bye, my darling. Give me a kiss. - Bye. Why did the lady say that your things were ugly? Forget about all this. Be nice at school. It's strange that the dog didn't bark. You know that he loves burglars. See you tonight. - Hello. - Hello. How are you? Hello. I'll pick them up at 4:30, OK? Good. Wait for me two minutes, I'll be right back. - Hi, Christine! - Hi, Marie. What were you doing in the house last night? I was bored. I rummaged about to entertain myself. I found this in her office... Charlotte, I'm fed up with your stories! You should have taken me to a hotel. You'll have your money tonight. You won't stay here five minutes more, OK? Great. Christine starts teaching at 11. Don't show up before that. Promised. I'm off. Be good, OK? Good as gold. I don't understand why they took that fan. - Good morning. - Hello. Excuse me, but I forgot my sheet music upstairs yesterday. In the workshop. That's OK, I'll go with you. Are you sure you forgot it upstairs? I'd like to, but it will be hard. I need to practise. You don't like to work? Yes, but... it won't be easy. DEAR MATHIEU, THANKS FOR EVERYTHING. SORRY IF I BOTHERED YOU. FAREWELL OR SEE YOU SOON, WHO KNOWS? CHARLOTTE DEATH OF THE WRITER BERNARD VANNIER Charlie. A 1,000 francs capital is deposited on a 5% annual interest account. A 1,000 francs capital is deposited... Excuse me a moment. What are you doing here? Can I talk to you right now? It's not really a right time but... Wait for me over there. I'm going out just a moment. Start working and no bedlam! What is it? Did you go into the workshop? - Marie-Cécile forgot her music sheets. - Did you notice anything strange? Non, nothing at all. Are you sure? What is it, Mathieu? Nothing, I lost some important things. I was wondering if you had seen them. And that's why you're bothering me in a middle of a class? I don't know what you're hiding from me, but it must be cumbersome. I hope you're having fun at least. We never knew what he was doing exactly. He said he was a journalist, that he wrote thrillers. Did Charlotte seem happy with him? At first, yes. But... they were arguing a lot lately. That is, when he came here, because we weren't seeing him often. You see, Charlotte... she used to stay there for hours, drinking alone. So one day, I told her to sing. I thought that it would do her good. She's gifted. Isn't she? I can't believe he just died like this. If you have news from Charlotte, call me. You're here? Yes, I have all these left to mark. - You must be hungry. - You bet. There's some stuff in the fridge. Marie's car was stolen. - By whom? - We don't know. Maybe E.T.'s big sister? Why don't you talk to me, Mathieu? One day or another, I'll know anyway. So it's best if you tell me yourself. Even if it's really bad. So? It's Charlotte. But you think it's her? Killing a man. Do you realise what it is to kill a man? If she'd done it, you would have seen in on her face. I don't know if I really looked at her. She didn't tell me he was dead. We didn't even talk much. Did you sleep with her? No. I'M THINKING ABOUT YOU, AND ANYWAY, DON'T FORGET I LOVE YOU. SEE YOU LATER, CHRISTINE PS: I FINISH CLASSES AT 5:00 Now at your newsagent, Marie-Claire Fashion Special. Hello? Is that you? Yes. Where are you? In Chinon. But I ran out of gas. I'm scared, Mathieu. Am I supposed to take care of you? You call and I come? This time it won't work, Charlotte. I'm fed up. Can you bring me some money? Where are you? In Chinon, as I said. Near Tours. There's a train leaving at 18:00. I'll wait for you at the station. Change at Saint-Pierre-des-Corps. There's someone at the door. Don't move. Just at the right time! You could have called. Hello? Hello? Shit! The chick took off? You're funny, you know? So? She called, she's 300 km away from Paris, with no money. Are you going to help her? I can't let her down. Of course. - She's alone, Christine. - Stop. Will you come back soon? Don't worry. Get off! Go! What do you think? I look like her, don't I? This way, I can use her passport. - Did she notice I took it? - Not yet. You don't like it? If it's tacky, it's not my fault. I took what looked best. I stole the wig in a shop. It took me all afternoon. Why didn't you tell me he was dead? Oh, Mathieu, I was so scared. I was so scared. We haven't been living together for a while. We were arguing too much, it became impossible. - Where did you stay? - Anywhere. At hotels. But I was always going back eventually. I was still hoping it would get better. On Friday, he promised he'd come and see me sing. He didn't come. I was furious. I left the club. I wanted to be alone. I hung around in Paris part of the night. Then I decided to call him. - We had to talk. - ... reached Bernard Vannier... I got the answerphone. I thought he was out. So I went up. In fact he was here with some chick, an American girl. Did you know her? No, why? You should find her. She may have things to tell. I don't even know her name. Keep on. I got very angry. I threw the American girl out and I got it off my chest. All the lies, the deceits, the mysteries, and me, always alone. He tried to calm me down. But I went crazy, I don't know what went over me. I yelled, I called him names. And I took off. I walked for a long time to snap out of it. Around 3 AM, I was beat. I only had one thing in mind, to sleep. So I went back to his place. And it was horrible. He was dead. There was blood everywhere. And a gun next to him. You believe me, don't you, Mathieu? It's true you know, I didn't kill him. Even if you're lying, I prefer to believe you. It smells nice. It smells of freedom. I'll pay you back. I'm going to work. A singer, in Spain, it could work. Are you tired? No, I'm thinking. We could investigate by ourselves. We could find the American girl or friends of his. No, we don't make the grade. Bernard had shady dealings, you know... It would be very dangerous. After all, they killed him. But don't worry, I have a plan. Tomorrow, we'll go to the station after abandoning the car that I borrowed. We'll take the train, each in different directions. I'll cross the border. And you'll go back to Christine. And we'll forget each other very quickly, you'll see. What if I left with you? What for? I don't love you anymore. Don't worry, I don't love you either. The lady boss liked us. We could have left without paying. - What's the point? - None. Just for fun. Give me the keys. Are you driving? It's a stolen car. Precisely, it's exciting. Stories to tell my grand-children when I'm old. "When I was young, I drove a stolen car." "No way! I'm telling you, my boy!" Leave it. It brings back memories. Not to you? Here's what it reminds me. Goodbye. Farewell. And thank you. For everything. Hello, children. Hello. - Are you having fun? - Yes. - What's your name? - Freddy. - And you? - Émilie. - It's your little brother? - Yes. Come, Freddy. We'll play a game. Look. - Do you know this man? - Yeah. - And you, Émilie? - Yes. - What's his name? - Mathieu. Is it your dad? No, it's Mathieu. Does he live here? - Yes, but he's not here. - Ah, he's not here. - And the lady, do you know who it is? - No. What do you want? Leave the children alone. Good afternoon, ma'am. Police. Miss? Come on, wake up. - How is he? - Groggy. With everything we gave him... What about her? I don't understand. It's impossible to wake her up. Poor thing. She must have been so scared. As long as she's sleeping, she's not talking bullshit. Very clever. Unlike you. Everything you say is intelligent. Stop it! Wake up. We've slept enough. Leave me alone. We can't stay here. Wake up. Come on. Make an effort. Let's go, the cops will come soon. - Ouch! - Shhh! - Does it hurt? - Slowly. Yes, it hurts! Come on. Here, put this on. They must have drugged me. - Does it hurt a lot? - I feel groggy. In your right pocket, there's a bit of money. Give it to me, thanks. Where are you going? To phone Christine. She has to come and pick you up. If I let you do it, you'll blunder again. Don't be stupid, you're hurt. How can we get out of this? Come to Paris with me and we'll find a good lawyer. I'll spend 20 years in jail for a guy who put me through hell. No. - We have nothing to do together. - If it was true, you wouldn't be back. Okay. Okay. - Hello? - Christine. - Is that you? - Yes, we had a problem. - A car accident. - Is it bad? The car is ruined and I broke my arm. I understand. I'm at the hospital, I'm coming out. They found a picture of you at the apartment of the guy who died. They're sure it's her. They want to hear your statement. - I can't come back now. - Then when? Two or three days maybe, I don't know. - What are you going to do? - She wants to go to Spain. Spain? But she accuses herself acting like that. She has to come back, Mathieu. I don't know if she's innocent, but she has to go to a safe place. You're really taking risks. She has to be protected. She's lost, you know. Like a child. They're all crazy. We haven't found the fastest one. The further I am from her, the happier. She's the one who wanted to live in Lyons. Personally, I love the sea. The seaside. The waves. Huh? The salty air, it's invigorating. Don't you think? It's really invigorating, yeah. Mind you, I could have asked a divorce, if I wanted to. Because 20 years of marriage are 20 years of hell. Hard, huh? - May I? - Please do. Although we don't have children. I wanted some, but at first. She didn't, she can't stand kids. She has all the flaws in the world. When I think about it, she really is a cow. But I keep her. Because I got used to it. I take it easy. Because, with another one, watch out. It would be adventures on every street corner. I'm a sales rep, not an explorer. Don't you hear a strange noise? - Oh? - We have a flat tyre, no? No! No, look. Wait, yes! I can't see very well, but there's smoke! - It smells of burnt rubber. - Yeah. Doesn't it? Sorry, Jojo. Hey! Are you crazy! My car! Come back! My car! Here, find a way to go back on Highway 10. - I think it's behind us. - I thought so. Hey! My car! Oh, no! Oh my! Damn. My car, it's mine. I can't believe it. It only happens to me. Me! It only happens to me. Hey! Oh, no! I can't believe it! Are you nuts! My car! A sales rep in joke articles, that's a job for me. "The Big Surprise." Ah! Blimey. So... I'm looking for a pair of trousers. Wait. - There's a tie already. - Look, the whole works. You look great. Again! No, be easy on the artist. The artist will die soon because his arm hurts a lot. Look. It's not nice. We have to find a doctor, or you'll get an infection. I'd feel terrible if they had to cut your arm. - Poor Mathieu. - So you're not that mean, are you? What do you think? Oh, that feels good! We could have a swim. - No, come look after me. - You don't think so? Come and look after me. So. We've loved each other for years and I never shaved you. Depends what you mean. Bastard! Careful, I can defend myself. No, that's enough. So don't say anything stupid. It's an adorable creature, but he was constantly living under a threat. Help! If you're not happy, go back to your wife. - Alright. - No, stop! I'm not finished. - I don't find Christine attractive. - Ah! She's a bit too... bland. A bit like a Golden. See what I mean? No one asked your opinion. It's my Golden, not yours. That's very true. Why did you come back? And why do you love me? Do you know the story of the monkey who was in love with a banana? No. So what? He was going to see his shrink, he paid him, and the next day, he was going back to see his banana. Yes? What if we didn't leave each other this time? Huh? That's your kamikaze side talking. Is it here? Oh! Hurry up, go, quick! Hurry! What are you waiting for? I don't want him to see me. Hurry up! You can sit up, we're on the road now. - Did you steal it from him? - Better than that! I told him fibs. Single mum, alone in life, sick child at the hospital. It always works. On top of that, he was Dutch. He didn't understand a thing. Why did you follow him into the truck? Because he didn't have any money on him, darling. I'm glad I succeeded. It's good, isn't it? Put your indicator on. We're going to get some gas. Didn't you accept a little deal instead? How does this thing open? That's it. Can you answer me? A little deal? What do you mean? What can you do to a guy in a car for 300 francs? - Do you have an idea? - You're mad! You're really mad. Wouldn't you be able of that? That's it, take it out on me. You've always taken me for a whore, it's your fantasy. Keep it if you want, but get it into your head that I never had sex for money. Tonight is a first then. You're really annoying. It's not your arm that's the most affected. What's wrong? Oh, shit. Cops. What shall we do? Stop? Non, you're mad. Go on, step on it! I must have hurt him real bad. Don't worry, he's already on his feet. They're coming, hurry up! I'm scared! Hail Mary, you're the best of all women. What's next? Can you see the path on the right? - I think so. - Turn off the headlights. - Oh, no! - Turn off the headlights! Slow down, we're going to turn. - Oh, no! - Careful! I can't hear anything, they didn't follow us. What do we do? - We walk. - Are you crazy? - If we drive, they'll catch us. - Do you think so? Definitely. Come on, let's go. There's a village not far, I saw a sign. It will take us one hour tops. - Come on! - My feet already hurt! Hello. Hello? It's me. Charlotte. - Where's Mathieu? - He's here, he's sleeping. He's not very well, he has fever. We've had troubles. We had to give up the car. Where are you? In a hotel in Barbezieux. It's near Angoulême. Christine, I... What? We need some money because... - Could you send us some? - How? A money order. At the post office, we'd get it straightaway. How much do you need? I don't know, whatever you can. Hello? Hello? Yes! Would you do that? I'm really not doing it for you. Of course. So tell Mathieu that... No, don't tell him anything. And don't thank me. There's no need. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. You don't have your ID papers, I can't do anything. At least tell me if the money's here. It's the rules, I can't tell you anything. Do me a favour, it's important. PARIS: THE MYSTERIOUS DEATH OF WRITER BERNARD VANNIER BERNARD VANNIER'S MISTRESS IS MISSING - They must have arrived last night. - I don't think so. Oh, Christine, what a surprise! It's nice of you to come, Michel will be delighted. Did you have a nice trip? It's great, the weather's beautiful. We booked you a room at the hotel. Why did you come? Last night, just after hanging up, I thought that... you wouldn't be able to get the money without ID. I didn't know how to contact you. My only clue was Barbezieux. So I took the minibus and here I am. I've already been to two hotels. I didn't have any cash at home, but if there's a bank... You're definitely bold. I suppose that it's a compliment in these circumstances. Yes. Well, thanks. Thanks again. I'll pay you back as soon as I can. It doesn't matter, I'm giving it to you. I'm going to hit the road now. I've left my son with my parents and I don't want to arrive late. You haven't slept. It doesn't matter, I'll drink coffee. You don't want to take a shower? No, I think I'd rather not enter this hotel. Put them away. And buy yourself some clothes. A hospital gown isn't very discrete. Ah! I was forgetting the main thing. In your situation, staying in a hotel is becoming... So here. It's my parents' house. They bought it not long ago. We... We were planning to spend holidays there with Mathieu. I made an itinerary. It's in the Landes, near a lake. You'll see, it's very pretty. And Spain is just 100 km from there. - I didn't kill Bernard. - I'm not the one you should convince. Well, Mathieu protects you and... I protect him, that's all. He'Il come back. He's very fond of you and Freddy. Don't overdo it, please. Let me know what you decide. Because I'm the one the police are questioning. Christine! She didn't want to see you. "Bernard Vannier's mistress is missing." This little dress I found is really cute. It's really cute. Red! It's a change. This one is nice too. It holds the road very nicely. Low consumption. You know what? I'm going for a pee. - Wait for me, don't move. - I'm staying here. Careful. Oh my God! It's really scary. Mathieu! - Yeah? - Look, the sea! It's beautiful! Up you go! Wait! Careful! I love you, Charlotte. Attention, platform number four, the train to Dax, Bayonne, Hendaye and Irun is about to leave. Please close the doors. Well done. Here. BERNARD VANNIER'S MISTRESS IS MISSING - I'd be scared if I were you. - Why? You're travelling with public enemy number one. I'm scared. - Where are we going? - Wait. - There a quiet little space there. - Yay! "I think I love you, you know. "I'll take my broom and bucket and I'll work hard to succeed..." Mahieu Stéphanie. It's a nice name, Stéphanie. - 22 years old. - Ah, unusable. Why? 22 years, you could be her mother. Idiot. It can always be useful. And for me, how do we do? Don't worry, I won't let you down. Look. He winked at me. It must be that way. Let's do some shopping. There's probably nothing in the house. Yeah, good idea. GROCERY Emilio! - Do you call that a grocery? - Can we have some bread. No, it makes you bloated. I'll give you some crispbread. Hello. Hola. Buenas tardes. Here are the soaps. If you take two, I'll give you a comb as a present. Well... And a nail file. - In that case, OK. - Congratulations! I'm putting them here. I'm going to get the comb. Here's the comb. Thank you. It's strange. Fernando is early, isn't he? No, he said he was coming back. I'm going. - He's a friend of my wife. - Really? Yes, he's a kind of caballero sirviente. A devoted admirer. How are you? What is he saying? "You go with older women thinking they're faithful, "and when you wake up, you're a cuckold anyway." How much do I owe you? I'll count. He's from Spain? Yes, Miss. He drives there every day. One way, then return. So we do each other favours. - It doesn't hurt? - No. Sure? It must be here. I hope so. I'm exhausted, my feet hurt. And I need a pee. It's true. Imagine, we go in and the police is there. Don't be silly. Don't go in! Another little kiss before we die. Do you think he sees us? Who? Bernard. If God does his job well, he'll have a ringside seat. Lying under the bolster. Stop, it freaks me out. Come. Mathieu. I killed him. It's true, we were arguing all the time. I often went to sleep in a hotel. Alone, quiet. On Friday, he promised he'd come to hear me sing. He didn't come. I don't know why, but it destroyed me. So I called. And I got the answerphone. I went upstairs. The house was empty. I waited. I looked through his things. There was nothing compromising. I knew it. I often rummaged through. But that night, opening a drawer, I found a gun wrapped up in a cloth. I had never seen any in my life. I didn't even know he had one. That's when he came in with the American girl. Of course, we had a fight. I threw the girl out. She left straightaway. She didn't insist. We kept on calling each other names, then we fought. We were mad. Mad. I took the gun on the table, he tried to take it from me, the gun just went off. Well, I think so. He fell. Can you imagine? I killed him. I was capable of that. And then, as a robot, I did what I had seen in the movies. Wipe off the gun, tidy up, shut the apartment. Then I went to yours, the only person who could help me. And when I saw you, I... It's over, Charlie. The lady is served. Did you sleep a little? Yeah. Eat, you have to fuel up. The hardest part next, we'll leave very soon. Tonight. Here. I love you. - Even after last night? - Specially. Because now, I have the feeling that... I mean, what's his name... it's a bit because of me that you... It was an accident, Mathieu. Well, let's say that I feel accomplice to an accident. I have the right to, no? Well. It's not getting any better. Here. I didn't find many things. You are a size 4, aren't you? Clothes. There you go. - You OK? - Yes... You're not reading? I know what it says. So... - And then... - And then? And then, it's nice here. It feels like we're on an island. There on the mainland, everybody is running around. Here, time has stopped. Which day are we? Hm, Friday. I'm a little baby and you're rocking me. You're rocking me. We could take a boat and we'd go over there, at the end of the horizon. What's over there? America. Next summer, we'll go to America together. OK? Ah, Freddy! You're so heavy! Oh, blimey! You've grown up! In three days, I don't think so. Come here, Freddy. - Hello. - Hello. We took a plane and a taxi. I had to see you. Alone, I can't cope anymore. Let's go and have a coffee. A man like this, he has a beard. Let me see. You lost your tooth. - Did the tooth fairy come? - Yes. Are you going back to Paris with us? No, listen, you'll have to be very nice with Mummy. Because you know, Freddy, maybe we won't see each other again. Well, not for a while. I'm going to have to leave. But I'll think about you all the time. A witness came forward. An old neighbour. Her window gives on the terrace of the apartment where... Anyway, she thinks she saw you. If you're innocent, you have to come back otherwise... What is it, my darling? He thinks you look like E.T.'s big sister. You're very observant, that's good. What does it mean, "observant"? Christine, I have to talk to you. But not in front of them. Come. Can I leave him with you for a moment? So? She decided, she wants to cross the border. And you? Are you leaving with her? Yeah. And the cops? You can tell them the truth. Did she confess? - No! It doesn't matter. - I was sure. Tell them I ran away with her so that... - So that I go to jail for complicity! - No, you're not at risk. You are a stranger to that story. A stranger, yes. You found the right word. Excuse me. It's crazy. You're leaving me for a girl you've known forever, who gave you a hard time and maybe killed a man! I don't understand. Something pushes me towards her, I can't explain it. I feel responsible, I feel that without me, she... Maybe you love her. Simple as that. Come on. Now that we've made the little boat, sit here. Wait for me, I'll go get a basin to make it float. - OK? - OK. You can't drop everything in five minutes. And Freddy, did you think about him? Let's go back, they're waiting for us. You already don't want to talk to me? But words won't change anything, you know that. Kiss me then. Kiss me. - Freddy? - Charlotte? Where's Charlotte? Over there. Did she go? She left you all alone? Yes, because I'm playing. She has nerve. We leave Freddy with her, and when we turn our backs... Look what she gave me. The lady is nice. It's pretty, it's shiny. Where is she? Are you still here? The lady said you were in Paris. Where is she? Did you see her? In the truck with Fernando. They talked and he took her. Where? I don't know! Where the sun shines. So she dumped you? TWO YEARS LATER... It's the third one. Are you sure? Come on Freddy, please. - I'll call on Saturday, late afternoon. - Late afternoon, yes. - I'll be at the beach. - Around six. Get on the train. Come on. - OK. - Get off, quick! I know him, he's my cousin, Matteo. Hello, cousin! It's my husband. Hello, are how you? Hello. Hello, cousin. Are you OK? I'm fine, yeah. I'll write you! - Do you still live at the same address? - Yeah. - Did you marry Christine? - Yes. I told you so. - Where are you going? - To Spain. Where do you live? What?
