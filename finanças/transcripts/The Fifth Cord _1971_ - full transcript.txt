'I am going to commit murder. 'I am going to kill another human being. 'How easy it is to say. 'Already I feel like a criminal. 'I've been thinking it over for weeks, 'but now that I have given voice to my evil intention, 'I feel comfortably relaxed. 'Perhaps the deed itself will be an anti-climax, 'but I think not. 'Already I can imagine the excitement. 'The thrill. 'The pleasure I will experience as I stalk my victim. 'How much effort is required to strangle? 'Perhaps a knife would be better? 'No. 'I want to feel the trembling flesh in my hands 'as I squeeze the life out of the body. 'What if there's a struggle and the victim escapes? 'I must think of a way to avoid that. 'There must be no mistakes.' Helene! Helene! Happy New Year! - This is Isabel. - Congratulations. Good luck! - Thanks. Et bonne ann?e! - Thank you. ' Happy New Year! ' Happy New Year! - Night! - Happy New Year! Happy New Year, Helene. Sincerely. You always did like jokes in bad taste, didn't you? Don't think I was trying to offend you. It wasn't a joke. You're not keeping your part of the bargain. Or have you forgotten? When I drink, I forget a lot of things. - It makes life much easier. - I haven't been drinking. Too bad. You really should sometimes. Good night. Goodbye, Andrea. Good night. Are you going out? - This is where we say good night. - I'll pick you up for dinner. I'd like that. Take me home, please. It gives me the creeps here. Ah! Walter! Walter! - Telephone... - I hear it! - Why don't you answer it? - Because you told me not to. Ever. It's the third time they've called. - You might have woken me up. - I couldn't. You were dead to the world. - How long have you been here? - All night. I waited for hours. When you finally showed up, you were in no condition to do anything. In fact, I even had to undress you. - You always liked undressing me. - Not when you're drunk. - Why don't you make me some coffee? - Am I your part-time mistress or maid? One of these days, I just might resign. - Where would you find a better position? - Don't worry. I'll find one. Or maybe you've just had enough of me. Hm? Look, if that's it, just tell me and... Happy New Year. Here we go again. 'Is that you, Bild? Where the hell have you been hiding?' - I had the phone unplugged. What's up? - 'You're not in the office, that's what. 'Now get your ass down here. And make it quick.' - Happy New Year, Mr. Bild. - Same to you. Take care, love. It's not your day. CHIEF EDITOR Late last night, in the tunnel. Now they've got him at the hospital. I sent Vogel. You'd have done better to send the nightwatchman. You said he was found by a young couple, hmm? Yes. You get down there and see if you can work up a feature. - All right. - Happy New Year to you, too. Right. - Well? - It's all there. I was just going to call it in for the late edition. "In the early hours of this morning John Lubbock, an English supply teacher "at the Group International School, was the victim of a brutal assault, "while..." - A little bit inaccurate, isn't it? - Why? In the first place, John Lubbock isn't English. He's Australian. Then the Group, like all these language schools, doesn't have a permanent staff or supply teachers. They are coming and going all the time, from all over the world. It's like a hotel. I'll see you in the office. I've already told you - visitors are forbidden. And that includes reporters. - Just a glance. - It's quite impossible, I'm sorry. - Can I help you, Mr. Bild? - Good morning, Doctor. Nobody can see Mr. Lubbock for now. The police were very definite about that. How is he? He has a fracture of the fourth cervical vertebra and is suffering from shock. Any news, Inspector? Assault with intent to rob, for the moment. You think I could have a few words with the couple who saved him? Those two are important witnesses. I won't print a word that would prejudice your investigation. The girl doesn't live far from the tunnel. Her name is Giulia Soavi. - And the boy? - You should know him. He's Walter Auer. He's got a sister called Lu. She's a friend of yours, isn't she? Oh, by the way, we might have to have a few words with you, too. I was one of the last people to see Lubbock last night. I understand. I am at your disposal. - Miss Giulia Soavi? - I've already told the police all I know! - So, go ask them! - Why can't I ask you? You're a lousy reporter. You don't think I couldn't have a friendly little chat? No! And for all I care, you can go to hell! Get out of here! I'll call my father! Lu? Lu? "'Dear Andrea, I'll be away until Tuesday. "'I was broke, so I took some money from the usual place. Have fun, Lu. '"PS, if you want to get laid, go ahead. You know it doesn't bother me."' - Who is it? - 'Andrea Bild. Remember him?' - What do you want? - 'I beg your pardon. 'I guess I was a mess at the dance.' You were. I accept your apology. Have you got the fire going? It's too cold down here. I'm catching pneumonia. 'I'm working.' Just for a moment, I promise you. I won't disturb you. Tony's grown a lot. The sofas are new. So is that painting. And I never did like this table. I never liked this face, either. I only want Tony to remember he has a father. And you, a very rich ex-husband. We haven't been through the divorce, yet, though I haven't seen him for months. - You wear glasses now. - Only when I work. A lot of changes in a year. It's bad for you not to make love, you know. When you've been drinking, you're impossible. Now please would you tell me what you came for? Tony doesn't approve of the prickles on your face. All right, what can I tell you about John Lubbock? - Everything you know. - Well, he's Australian, from Sydney. He's 26. Like me, he teaches at the Group, but only since October. He's quite good, actually. He's quiet, shy, introverted. Goes to concerts quite often. An excellent tennis player. Almost fanatical about it. - Shouldn't you be taking notes? - I have a memory like an elephant. - Are you friends? - No. Just canoscenti, the Italians say. It's not easy to get close to John. Poor John. He's really started off the new year well. - First Isabel, and now this. - Isabel Lancia? Yes, in person. I wouldn't want you to quote me, but... I got the impression he's flipped over her. A juvenile crush, nothing more, of course. But he's been living every second of it. And now it looks as though Isabel is marrying Edouard Vermont, his best friend. He realized at the party. A terrible blow for him. I didn't notice anything. - I'm not surprised. You were drunk. - As usual. Go on, say it. - You won't offend me. - John will never let it show. He's too proud to. Yes? Some water. The crutches. Please. - Oh, Richard, sleep in here. - Not tonight. I'm very tired. Oh, please. - Please. - Tomorrow. - No, don't answer it. - I have to. Yes? Yes. Where? Very well. I'll come at once. I have to go on a call. I won't be long. Richard! Come back! Richard? Is that you, Richard? Richard? Ah! Oh, God. Where is it? Where is it? The telephone... Where's the telephone? Richard! Richard! Richard! Richard! - What was the motive, Inspector? - Was she sexually assaulted? - Did you find a murder weapon? - Inspector, can you give us a statement? She was strangled and thrown down the stairs. - Having a nice morning, Inspector? - You're here, too, Bild? Come with me. At about 11 o'clock, Dr. Binni received a telephone call. An urgent summons, which turned out to be a hoax. A hoax? Whoever telephoned gave a non-existent address. Who discovered her? Dr. Binni himself when he returned. It was the manservant's night off, so she was alone in the house. Huh? Call Haller. He should be at home. Get him on the other line. I'll hold on. Mm-hm. Um... you were one of Dr. Binni's patients, too, if I'm not mistaken. Yeah, that's right. Is it true the front door was never locked at night? Yes, he used to leave prescriptions here for his patients after the clinic was closed. - Did you know his wife? - Not very well. Mm-hm. I see. Who's the man sitting next to Binni here? That's Edouard Vermont. He teaches French at the Group School. So, according to the statement you gave us, John Lubbock announced that... that he was going to walk home. Who heard him or could have heard him, beside yourself? Well, I'd been drinking quite a lot that evening. However, if I'm not mistaken... Let me drop you off. It's no trouble, John. No, thanks. You're very kind, Helene, but I prefer to walk. All right, Isabel, can we go? Helene, keep all those resolutions, eh? - Happy New Year! - Bye, Andrea. - Nobody else? - No, I don't think so. Oh, yes, Dr. Binni was there, too. Please understand, this is only a formality, but what did you do after the party? Frankly, I don't remember. I haven't got an alibi, if that's what you want to know. Like I told you before, I had too much to drink. I wonder if our friend Binni didn't invent the telephone call. Hm. That's rather a dangerous theory. Anyway, Dr. Binni has a sound alibi. At the moment of the crime, he was visiting a friend. May I know the name? Edouard Vermont. Does that young lady, Miss Lu Auer, live with you? - Not always. - Yesterday evening, what did you do? - Stayed home and watched television. - Was the young lady with you? No. I have nothing else to tell you. If you'll excuse me, I have to get back to the paper. But don't you want to know any more? So you can write about it? Just like in the Lubbock case, Inspector. Exactly. It was found with the body of Sofia Binni. - However, there is a slight variation. - One finger has been cut off. It might be a way of saying... ...that there are four more crimes on the books. Hello? Dr. Binni, please. Don't bother to express your sympathy. Poor Sofia was a living corpse these past two years. It would be sheer hypocrisy on my part to pretend I was greatly pained by her passing away. However, I am glad you wanted to see me. I'd like to be certain you haven't been misinformed. I know the kind of cheap stories you reporters print. To tell the truth, I received orders not to interview you. Let's not beat about the bush. What do you want to know? One simple detail. That voice on the telephone... was it a man or a woman? It was extremely muffled. Rather flat and toneless. Affected by laryngitis, I should say. So, you couldn't tell whether it was a man or a woman? Whoever it was, it's clear the murderer knew how to get into my house. After all, it's very easy. The front door's never locked. - Do you suspect anyone? - No. - Nothing missing from the house? - Not a thing. It's always possible it was a madman. What do you think? No murderer is completely sane. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go. One last question. What was the address you were told on the phone? - Via Bruxelles. - Number? - Eleven. It doesn't exist. - You thought you'd taken it down wrong? - Exactly. There was no way of checking. - So you visited a friend. Edouard Vermont lives quite close to Via Bruxelles, doesn't he?. I see you're well informed. Goodbye, Mr. Bild. - Well, well. - Surprise. - I thought you'd found another position. - No. Here I am. Back at the same old stand. Are you sure you haven't come to get your severance pay? I was dying to see you. It happens sometimes. Where have you been all this while? Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies. I was at home studying. I have a history exam on Thursday. Didn't I tell you? What's wrong? I telephoned your house. Your mother said she hadn't seen you in over a month. You're a lying little whore! What kind of dump do you come from? Your mother doesn't take care of you. Your father's gathering mold in a state home for the aged. And you play tramp in one sports car after another. - Was it a red sports car? - A Triumph. That car just happens to belong to my brother Walter, you idiot! Ever since you've been playing detective, you can't get anything right! You really have been a laugh! You're pathetic. What does your brother do? He... he races. He's a racing driver. Didn't you know? Where are you going? Lu? Lu? Lu! Lu... You are playing games on me, eh? Come here, you! Ah! Come here, you bitch! Come here, you coward! Are you on the sports desk of your paper? I just want to talk to you, if you've got a moment to spare. Why? What do you do all day when you're not engaged in a race? Is that important? Everything is important for a reporter. For example, what did you do all day last Tuesday? There was a Formula race at Brel. I came in second. And there was the usual party afterwards. Why do you ask? Were you very late coming back? About ten the next morning. I stayed with friends, if that's what you want to know. Even if I don't understand why. That'll do for me. Thank you very much, and good luck. I'd like to speak to Dr. Binni. Yes. Is that you, Richard? This is Walter. Come in. I knew you'd get around to looking me up, sooner or later. I read your latest article. Sometimes you reporters are much more perceptive than the police. There is one point on which I don't... Excuse me. This place makes me nervous. Do you mind if we go outside? - What were you going to say? - Oh, yes. Like the police, you also seem to be convinced that my attacker merely intended to rob me. I don't agree, Andrea. He intended to kill me. - Like it did Sofia Binni. - You knew her quite well, didn't you? Not really, but I felt sorry for her, even if she wasn't particularly pleasant. I hope that whoever it is, is satisfied with having reduced me to this. After all, he could always turn up again to give me the coup de bloody grace! It sounds morbid, but somebody is playing games with me on the phone now. It rings at the most unlikely times, usually the middle of the night. - I answer and there's nobody there. - Have you informed the police? What's the point? I tried to get the number changed, but that takes time. The best defense, I suppose, is to unplug it. Here we are. This is where I live. Can I offer you a drink? Hello? 'Is that you, Mr. Bild?' Yes, who is speaking? 'Let's just say a friend. 'Someone who wants to keep you out of trouble. 'If I were you, I'd stop asking all those questions. 'If you don't, you are going to be very sorry, Mr. Bild.' 'Tuesday, March 29th. 'Now that I have had time to savor the memory of my first success, 'I find that it has lived up to all expectations, 'even if, I must admit, I had hoped for greater appreciation. 'There has been a conspiracy of silence on the part of the press 'and the police. Sic transit gloria mundi. 'People must be made to realize that I am someone to be reckoned with. 'I will strike again! 'There is something profound, even divine, 'in being able in one second 'to transform a member of the human race into inanimate matter. 'Forever.' Andrea! Darling! Well, are you going to tell me what my horoscope says? It says that the boss is looking for you. And that your future's not so bright. - Want me to ask the stars what to do? - I think it's too late! I'm sorry, Andrea. I have no choice. I'm obliged to take you off the story. - But I don't understand. - Haller telephoned me. - He pointed out that you were... - On the list of suspects. Not exactly. Yes? Everything's ready, sir. They're waiting for you. Thank you. Then I don't see any reason why I should step aside in such a big thing as this! - If I'm not mistaken. - And if I'm not mistaken? I'm the one who decides things around here. So let me repeat: you've been pulled off the story. - Did you know I was off the story? - Ah, Bild... I was going to send you over to cover the bankers' convention. You make me puke! The lot of you! Vogel may take your crap, but not me. You think I don't know Dr. Binni is a big shareholder in this rag? And then he came into a quarter of a million when his wife died. All right, so what? Don't shout! You always were stupid! Haven't you realized yet that your crazy, non-conformist ideas don't go around here? You're not the man you were, Bild. I thought there was some good in you, boy, but then you hit the bottle. All you're good for now is dragging your ass in this cesspool of a newspaper! Is that so? You listen to me. I may have become a piece of shit, but you are what you were when you started, a bastard who has sold his soul. I warn you, you'll pay for this! You're home late tonight. There was a meeting at the school. What's the matter? Anything wrong? I felt I wanted to talk to somebody. Good bye. I'm in bad shape. Don't you give a damn? Let's sit in my car. You've been arguing again with Traversi, I suppose. - I could kill him. - Is it that bad? Have you asked yourself why? Maybe because he reminds me of my father. He's a cheap, slimy worm. And you're afraid you're going to end up just like him. You really can't stand me, can you? Why don't you leave the paper? You told me once you wanted to freelance, see the world. And you said you'd come along. Tony must be awake. I have to go. I'll call you. Travers?.! "O Lord, we beseech thee, thy mercy, "that she who prayed that thy will might be done "may not receive punishment for the misdeeds, "but that even as here below the true faith united her to the ranks of the faithful, "so in Heaven, by thy mercy, she may have fellowship with the choirs of angels. "Eternal rest grant unto her, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon her. "May she rest in peace. "May her soul and the souls of all the faithful departed, "through the mercy of God, rest in peace. Amen." - I must talk to you. Please, ring me. - Isabel! Isabel! I believe the autopsy, but we found a glove beside the body. Two fingers are missing this time. - Where were you yesterday evening? - I went to see Mrs. Volta. - What time was that? - About 10:00 or 10:30pm, I think. How long were you together? About half an hour, then I went home to bed. Miss Auer was not there this time, either, if that's what you want to know. We have an attempted murder and two murders. In all three instances, you were one of the few people who knew all the victims. Funny coincidence, isn't it? Especially since you have no alibi in any of these three cases. - I know. - Still, we haven't decided to formulate charges against you... for the moment. You're very kind. Could I just inquire how you knew I had a fight with Traversi? We received an anonymous telephone call this morning. And was it a man or a woman? A man. What are you thinking? I have been mulling over your theory that someone could take advantage of a situation like this and could quite happily bump off someone else, leave a glove at the scene of the crime and use our murderer as a scapegoat. My theory could be applied to the Traversi case, right? Why not? Who would want to get rid of Traversi? Well, you had a good motive. Now poor Traversi's gone, who will be the next editor? You. That'll be the day. I have crazy, non-conformist ideas and I'm a drunk, remember? No, Traversi's murderer made those calls to me and the police. Somebody who knew about my troubles in the office. He was trying to frame me. - Who did know about your troubles? - The whole building. I was very loud. - Look who's there, Tony! - Mamma, Andrea! Tony! I've been watching those two outside. You can tell they're police a mile away. - Huh! They're my guardian angels. - I know. They kept me at the damn station all morning. They wanted to know how long I know you, when I see you, if I knew Traversi. God, they're such bores! How did you make out? Had a little fun, led them up the garden path. God, I hate cops! Well, why don't you ask me why I'm back? Why should I? It's nothing new. - I'm not coming here again. - I've heard that before. Oh, Andrea, you're hopeless, but this time I mean it. Mm-hm. I've got some news. I'm getting married. Who's the lucky man? Oh, you don't know him. His name is Frank Gray. What would Frank say if he knew about us? - Nothing. - It wouldn't bother him, hmm? He's always known. But it'll be different when we're married. We both want children. We're both crazy about children. I won't be seeing you again, Andrea. - And you're not even angry? - Why should I be angry? Well, I do see you're not wasting any time. A little while ago, somebody called Isabel Lancia telephoned. - What did she say? - She wanted to see you urgently. She's expecting you at nine at the Grand Hotel. I wrote down her room number over there. - Is your car out back? - Yes. Give me your keys and leave these lights on. I'll take you. I'm going anyway. Then we will leave now through the courtyard. Wait for me. I won't be long. Miss Lancia? Miss Lancia! That didn't take very long. Stay with me tonight. For the last time. 'The minister announced that the topics of discussion at the meetings 'would be the balance of payments and the current monetary crisis. 'Police were called to a well-known hotel in the capital late this evening 'when Isabel Lancia, daughter of Carl Lancia, the well-known shipbuilder, 'was found dead in the bathroom of her suite. 'A police spokesman said Miss Lancia's body was discovered by Edouard Vermont, 'fiance of the victim. They were to have married later in the year. 'The same spokesman added that the case was being treated as murder, 'but was made no comment when asked 'there's any connection between Miss Lancia's death...' What time did you come home last night? Why don't you ask those two idiots you've got hanging around my door? And the young lady, was she with you? Yes, from 7 o'clock yesterday evening, Inspector. - You did me a great favor. Why? - I wanted to give you a farewell present. Aren't you going to ask me if it was I who killed her? That's your business. - What are you going to do? - Pack my bags. This business is beginning to make me nervous. I've given in my notice at the school. I'm going back to Sydney. Whoever sent you this seems quite sure that you know who he is. Nevertheless, he still goes to the trouble of sending me an anonymous letter, instead of coming straight to the point as he did with the others. Funny, isn't it? No, you can keep it. Print it. Give it to the police. Whatever you like. And, you know, in case it may help you with your investigations, there is one detail that might interest you. There was no stamp on the envelope. It was put directly into the school mailbox. - When are you going to leave? - Some time this week. Now that Isabel is dead, there's no reason for me to stay here any longer. I understand. Nothing matters to me anymore. Absolutely nothing. Good bye. - Where's Giulia? - Oh, It's too early for her. - But I'm here and I know the same tricks. - Another time. - Thanks. - Get lost! Anyone in? Is anyone there? What the hell do you want? I'll call the police! We'll see who calls the police. I'll run you in for corruption and exploitation of minors, and anything else I can find on the way. I want to know everything! Especially what you didn't tell the police. I don't know anything. - Maybe this will help you to remember. - You'll pay for this. Who was it who attacked John Lubbock in the tunnel? - You saw him. I know you did! - I don't know. I don't know! I swear, I'll kill you! Who was it? Who? Giulia's father. Old Soavi. Don't try to be smart. You know that I can check, huh? It's the truth. Giulia said she'd leave me if I told the police. And of course you prefer to keep the girl. Huh? It was like having money in the bank. Right? And Dr. Binni, was he only paying you for your performances? Huh? Answer me! No. Not just for that. Giulia's father, it was his idea. - You were blackmailing him? - Yes, and Vermont, too. But Soavi has nothing to do with any of those murders. I know he's a dirty old man, but he's not a murderer. Why are you so sure of it? Because he works for Hoffer Transport every Tuesday. He takes a truck up north and he doesn't come back until late Wednesday night. What does that prove? Dr. Binni's wife and Isabel Lancia were both murdered on a Tuesday. It was early on Wednesday that Soavi himself was arrested. Huh? How does that fit in with this trucking business you're telling me about? Last Tuesday, there was a strike at Hoffer Transport. He didn't leave, but he didn't kill Giulia either, even though he was spying on her. Well, what is it you want? To tell you frankly I'm prepared to publish everything I know in another paper. What was your relationship with Giulia Soavi? - Who's Giulia Soavi? - The girl who was killed last night. - I've never met her in my life. - Not even at your little private parties? What on earth are you talking about? You must be mad. All right, I'll be frank, too. If you insist on continuing this inquiry of yours, fine, go ahead. Perhaps I'll show you once and for all that I have nothing at all to fear, either from you or the police. Now please go! I have patients to see. Mr. Vermont, please. Is that you, Edouard? I've got to talk to you. There's not a moment to lose. - Are you really going to publish this? - Yes, it's coming out tomorrow. I thought Dr. Binni was a nice little man. You think he's the murderer, don't you? I don't know, yet. - Will your husband be there? - No, I'm going to see my lawyer. - Charles and I only argue. - Over Tony, I suppose? Over the terms of the divorce. Until everything is settled, I can't live my own life. You're not listening, are you? There's something similar about these murders, but I can't put my finger on it. Well, in my humble opinion, I think Vermont's the fly in the ointment. See you tonight. - When will you be back? - At 9:00pm. At least I hope to be, but it's Tuesday, so I might be late. Your horoscope lady said it's not my day. The Black Maria would have made this seem more complete. Do you want another alibi? - I haven't got one. - I know. Look, Inspector, you've had men following me for a long time, so you know I didn't kill anybody. If you lock me up now, I'll have a perfect alibi when the last finger gets cut off that glove. If you give me time to get my facts straight, I'm pretty sure I can find your murderer for you. What have you got to lose? You've got four murders on your hands and your investigation isn't getting anywhere. Why don't you tell what you know and let us follow through? It's quicker if I work alone. I see. Does your scoop mean so much to you? Doesn't yours, Inspector? You have to build a career in the police, too, I believe. Dr. Binni's wife and Isabel Lancia were both murdered on a Tuesday. At least I hope to be, but it's Tuesday, so I might be late. Your horoscope lady said it's not my day. 'Monday, January 1st. 'John Lubbock, born March 23rd, brutally attacked.

I'm coming on the next plane. - Did you have supper? - 'Yes, I watched television, too. - 'Then I went to bed.' - Now you go back to bed, darling. - And let me speak to Elsa. - Elsa's not here. She went to the airport to meet you like you said in the telephone call. - Who telephoned? - I don't know. Somebody. Elsa said the dentist called, too, for tomorrow. - Tony... - 'Yes, Mamma?'

'Not with Isabel Lancia, but with Edouard Vermont. 'For Lubbock, Isabel was a femme fatale, 'who had seduced a reluctant Vermont away from him, 'and therefore she had to be punished. 'By committing five murders, he thought he could hide his real motive. 'I called Dr. Binni last night.

'The little boy may be innocent, but I will save him from being thrust 'into this world of injustice and violence. 'I hope Helene will understand.' And this is how he did the telephone effect.
