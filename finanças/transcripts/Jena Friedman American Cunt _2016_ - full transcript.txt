[music] Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together and give some love and energy to Jena Friedman. [applause and cheering] Thank you guys. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you guys so much for coming out to American Cunt [applause and cheering] Thank you. I've done this show quite a bit and when I first wrote it I didn't realize what an offensive word it is. American. [laughter] It's such an offensive word in every other country that I've done this show, American is a more offensive word. In the UK, cunt is a term of endearment. But here it's a very loaded word. But why, we have such a beautiful literary tradition with the word cunt. Shakespeare used the word cunt, Chaucer, James Joyce, D.H. Lawrence, Samuel Beckett, so many great men... [laughter] ..throughout history have used the word cunt, and I'm sure women would have too, if we were taught how to read. [laughter] I have no allegiance to the word cunt, I'm not trying to reclaim it, I don't identify as a cunt. If anything I identify as a New Yorker, any New Yorkers in the house? [cheering] Awesome. For those of you who aren't we are I guess Like a level of cunt. Just 'cause of what it takes to live here, it's so hard. The other night I got my first up-skirt photo of the season. I was walking on Broadway, a guy came up behind, snapped a photo up my skirt, and it happened so fast by the time I realized What he had done he was halfway down the block And I just wanted to scream at him but I couldn't think of what to say Other than, pay me. [laughter] 80 bucks. Or venmo. In my 20's I would have chased him down but now I just want to get paid [laughter] About a year ago, the place across the street from where I used to live exploded. The Super was syphoning gas, the whole building went up in flames, the place I used to get foot massagees burnt to the ground. I say massagees because he was a hand-job place. But they gave the best foot massages because they were so happy it wasn't a dick. [laughter] They still did it like this but they were so happy my foot was not a dick, you know, I was so happy, My foot, we were all just, you know, life's little joys. But I was lamenting the loss of this place to a friend of mine who told me about a massage parlor his friend went to. And his friend was lying on the table getting a massage and he got a boner and the masseuse saw it and she said do you want a wank and he was like, yeah a little. So then she leaves and he's just lying on the table with an erection for like ten minutes waiting for her to come back, And finally she does and she says, are you finished? [laughter] It's like, what a feminist hand-job place. I hope she charged for that time. Feminism. It's so trendy now and it scares me. And the one person who laughs at the word feminism. The least funny word you could say onstage. It's so trendy now and it scares me when words become trendy because I think They become more open to corruption and like, there's so many new flavors of feminism It's just hard to keep up, there's sex positive feminism, which if you don't know is a really cool term For women who love anal. [laughter] Male feminists, are there any male feminists in the audience? [applause] Thank you, I love you guys, I love male feminists, I just wish you could support us Without having to take credit for it. Love male feminists. I'm getting older now, I feel great though, I still fit into my 9/11 jeans. I never forget how good I looked in those, the weapons of mass seduction. These aren't those, don't get weird, These are from, I think, Katrina. They're still wet. I have all these questions about getting older as a female Like, how am I supposed to catch cabs once I become invisible? [laughter] I know we shouldn't make fun of women over 60, there could be some here, but how would we know? You can't see them. I was just in Los Angeles pitching a script. It's kind of like the Sixth Sense But about a man who sees women over 60 as attractive, and they were all like, too high concept. What's a woman over 60 and it's like, oh LA, ah. We have them in New York it's just hard to tell Because of what New York City does to all women, the wear and tear, the elements that get thrown in our faces, bodily fluids and like air conditioning unit jiz that gets, all of it just after a certain point all just makes us look like we eat out of a trash can. [laughter] Women are my target demo, we just don't know it yet 'cause we're taught to hate each other. But I think we can be best friends, as long as we don't have the same color hair. Be like Tina and Amy hosting the Golden Globes. And I think we need to do a better job At supporting each other. That's what I'm talking about, like right ladies? [applause and cheering] Thank you, thank you. I think we need to do a better job At supporting each other 'cause we suck at it And I realized this after last year's London Marathon, there is a runner, her name is Kiran Gandhi, she ran the whole marathon while on her period, with no tampon or pad or anything. I think she was trying to raise awareness about periods. It's like half the population already kind of gets it But you be you. I support you Kiran. She got a lot of shit for that. But I think as women, and men, we need to get behind her. Not literally 'cause that would be a mess but, I think she's onto something. Like if we want workplace equality we can't just lean in, we have to bleed out. Seriously, seriously, if you walk into your boss' office with blood on your person, you might get that raise. You'll definitely get that office. He'll be like, take it, ugh, I'm out of here. I think the best way to age gracefully as a woman is to have been born a man. [laughter] Which brings me to Caitlin Jenner. She is fair game now that she's come out in support of Ted Cruz I want to be PC when I talk about Caitlin, Like is it not politically correct to assume Caitlin might be a bad driver, if it was Bruce who committed vehicular manslaughter. Not Caitlin, God forbid no, but Bruce Jenner, a lot of people don't recall, Bruce Jenner ran over a 69 year old woman and was never prosecuted. In his defense, he might not have seen her. [laughter] We have one of our first openly trans female athletes and her name is Fallon Fox and she is an MMA fighter and she's killing it. 'Cause she's beating up women. [laughter] Hey I support her, I support you Fallon, I support her, it takes ball... it takes a lot of courage to do what she's doing, I support you Fallon, my only question is, could you have picked any other sport? Literally, every other sport doesn't involve attacking women and like, I'm insensitive, and it's not like she was an MMA fighter and then transitioned. No, she transitioned and was like, what will I be great at? [laughter] I don't want to be insensitive, but maybe that's who I am. Maybe I'm an insensitive person trapped in a woman's body. It's so hard to talk about gender identity with sensitivity and nuance so we just don't. We just don't even talk about it. What we're doing though is we're like, Canceling shows and silencing people. Mount Holyoake, a woman's college, Mount Holyoake recently canceled a performance Of The Vagina Monologues because they felt the term vagina was too narrow a view of what it means to be a woman and I'm like, it stretches, but also. [laughter] Don't make me, don't make me defend The Vagina Monologues. What a shitty show. I spent a decade as a comedian working my butt off to not say vagina onstage, but now that it's being taken away from me I'm like, vagina. It's so hard to talk about this stuff And I blame the estrogen supplements. I'm not talking about transwomen. I'm not talking about transwomen, I'm talking about myself, a cisgender woman. Take it or take it, better than the other C word. I was on the pill for two weeks in my twenties. And it made me bat shit insane. Estrogen makes all women, cis and trans, insane. It doesn't make us kill people like testosterone. [laughter] It doesn't make us punch a wall 'cause we stubbed our toe you fucking mammals. But it makes us all a little nuts. And I think the larger issue is I've always had the privilege to never have to question my own gender identity. So now that I am, I guess that there Is another option besides being a woman I'll take it. Gender neutral, gender fluid, two spear, whatever that is can probably drive in Saudi Arabia. On the bright side, I don't think There's any better time or place to be a woman than in the global north in 2016. But then I think about the American South and it breaks my heart, but it's also my favorite portion of the show [laughter] The abortion portion. The abortion portion. I have so many abortion jokes. Hey they just keep writing themselves, But I think the best thing about abortion jokes is that no one tries to steal them. They are like the unwanted children of jokes. And I don't think abortion is even a political issue as much as it is a branding issue. In Texas for example, if instead of abortion If we just called it fetus hunting. They would be so excited to take the kids to Planned Parenthood and go fetus hunting on the weekends. Same with Florida, if we called abortion early retirement, done and done you know? Alabama. I have one for every state. If in Alabama if we called abortion the death penalty, the whole state would vote for it. The whole state would vote for it. Alabama's state bird is the electric chair. Is anyone here from Alabama? It's a trick question, they don't fund public transit so it's very hard to leave. It's very hard to get out. There's a war on women going on in our country. Planned Parenthood's getting attacked left and right getting accused of selling baby parts, it's like, please, first of all they're not baby parts it's fetal tissue And second of all, they're not selling them, they're practically giving them away. [laughter] I get in a lot of trouble for my abortion jokes. After Antonin Scalia passed away I took to Twitter, because that's how I grieve, and I Tweeted, now that's what I call a late-term abortion. It was too soon, it was lightning fast but. I got a lot of shit for that, a lot of people Tweeting at me, telling me they wish I had been aborted. Yeah. And it just warmed my heart. Because at least they're coming around. [laughter] Thank you. [applause] Thank you. It's like if you want me to have been aborted maybe the zygote Of a pregnant teen isn't so far behind. What bothers me most about abortion laws in the states is that they are not based on science. In Virginia for example, if you want to get an abobo in. [laughter] Do you guys call it an abobo? No one does. If you want to get an abobo in Virginia, they make you get an ultrasound they show you a photo of the fetus, and then they send you away to deliberate on it For like 24 hours or 48 or 72 until it's crowning. Where's the science to that? Where's the science that says showing me a photo of my fetus is going to make me want to keep it, they're not cuddly. It's like Republican lawmakers, and I should say Right Wing lawmakers Because by the time this special airs That Party may no longer exist but. [laughter] Right Wing lawmakers. Conservative lawmakers. If you want me to keep a child, I respect your choice to not resect mine, but at least sell me on it. Don't show me a photo of a fetus, Show me a photo of something that resonates, Like maybe a photo of myself in 60 years trying to walk down a flight of stairs alone. [laughter] Any moms in the audience? [applause] Thank you for coming out and abandoning your kids, thank you. Thank you moms. I love moms. I'm such a fangirl of moms. When I was young I'd just follow one around All the time in a van. Love moms. Especially single moms, single moms are like, so Indy. They're so DIY. [laughter] Working moms, oh working moms are so bad ass, it's like saying Chai tea, two words that mean the same thing. [laughter] My friend just had a kid and I asked her how it went and she said, to tell you the truth Jena, He almost gave me a vaganus. I was like, what's a...? What? That's a thing, it's called a four 30 tear, a child can literally rip you a new asshole. We don't know about this cause if we did we'd become extinct. But a child can literally rip you a new asshole and then, you have to love it? And if you leave it in a car for two minutes You can go to jail, that's so messed up. I've never been to jail, 'cause I'm smart. Just kidding, it's 'cause I'm white. [laughter] I hope you're not clapping 'cause you're white. It's so hard for a white woman in 2016 to go to jail that we have a TV show about the one time it happened. It's hard to get a TV show, sometimes It feels like you literally have to have two heads to get a TV show in America. Have you guys seen that show, Abby and Brittany, on TLC? For those of you who don't know TLC Is like a modern-day Ripley's Believe It or Not. And there's a show, Abby and Brittany, About conjoined twins, two heads, one body, if they'd called it that it would have gotten cancelled. It wasn't actually cancelled it was postponed indefinitely because you can't exploit people and then cancel them, It's kind of bad PR. But the reason I bring up Brittany and Abby Is because they're the most confident women I've ever seen. If I had two heads I'd be very insecure, I'd probably just grow my hair really long And take turns hiding in it. But they are out there, living life to the fullest, they're going on dates, they're turning down men, they make me want to have two heads, just as a writer, to have someone to bounce ideas off of. [laughter] To have someone around who knows me and gets me And could give me good life advice. Like, Jena, stop dating jerks. But would jerks even date me if I had two heads? Probably not. It's like a pretty nice guy move. A jerk might like, fuck both my mouths And not take me to brunch. [laughter] Jerks. Brittany and Abby are the most confident women I've ever seen in my life and I think they hold the key to how we need to raise all girls, to instill within the the confidence to be able to handle whatever life throws at them, we need to raise our girls as if they were born with multiple heads. Looks don't matter, what counts is up here. But we don't do that, what do we do? We give our girls Barbies, we give our daughters Barbies. Now we have Barbies without thigh gaps. Mattel recently issued a new line of Barbies without thigh gaps, it's like come on, if you have a chubby daughter don't give her chubby Barbie, strap her to a treadmill and make her chase it. It's not a fat joke. It's not a fat joke, it's just a window into how I was raised. Worse case scenario she ends up a comedian. But we don't do that, we give boys action figures you know, and it's like we're never going to achieve equality As long as boys get action figures and girls get like, sedentary sex dolls without holes. [laughter] It's so weird how we market to girls and women, like I was walking down the street the other day And this guy came up to me, and he said I never do this, but I think you're cute and I'd like to get your number. And he wasn't really my type but I didn't want to discourage his romantic gesture, So I said how about my email? And he was like, no, your number or nothing, and I was like, nothing dude, like I don't even know you, and so he just walked away. And I was like what type of person Would only want my phone number and not my email? And then it occurred to me, a telemarketer. Okay, even if that guy wasn't a telemarketer, I would not put it past any company in 2016 to just hire random dudes to chat up women on the street, get our phone numbers and all of a sudden you have like a text popping up From Brian that's really just like an ad for Nussa yogurt. And then next thing you know, the guy you've been sleeping with for three months is really just part of Nestle's street team trying to get you pregnant so that you'll buy their infant formula. So ladies, practice safe sex so that Nestle doesn't creep into your womb. [laughter] This joke has been brought to you by Trust Issues. They're real and I have them. I was talking to a male comedian recently. Oh, now we're all quiet. Shush. What did he have to say? I was talking to a male comedian recently, He said I feel so bad for women it seems so hard to be you guys you guys will just drop everything If you meet someone you love, you'll just drop your careers for love. He's not entirely wrong, I have female friends who have put their careers on pause to start a family, 'cause in America we don't have paid leave, but men aren't that different. You guys might not drop your careers for love, but you'll fuck it up for a sex crime. [laughter] Which brings me to Cosby. I don't want to joke about Bill Cosby because to this day he remains one of my favorite anesthesiologists. Everyone's always like, Bill Cosby's such a great storyteller, It's like, we see that now, but also a pretty exceptional anesthesiologist. I mean that many women, to be able to put that many women to sleep and make sure that they woke up without any med school, without any training. Some of you might be thinking did they all wake up? I don't know, that's not for a comedian to figure out, But if any of you work for the news, get on it. I'm not a statistician but they probably didn't all wake up. [laughter] People don't like jokes about dead people, okay now. Part of me wonders is it too late to joke about Bill Cosby 'cause he's been in the news for so long, but he keeps being in the news 'cause women Keep coming out in pairs, like we go to the bathroom, accusing him of rape, and women are going to keep coming out Because it's very scary for women to come out and admit to the world That they were born before 1980 [laughter] I don't even tell people my age anymore, I just say I'm younger than the amount of women Cosby's raped. Which puts me under 60, who's counting? He blocked me on Twitter. Whoa. >> Thanks, he blocked me on Twitter recently, I was upset about it, it actually made me a little sad, I took it personally But I was like, don't take it personally, You know blocking women, silencing women is just his version of foreplay Silencing women is Bill Cosby's version of foreplay. I want to take this moment to thank the guys In the audience for not silencing me, for not blocking me, for being here. Men, thank you for being here, thank you for listening to me guys, Give yourselves a round of applause, just the men. [applause] Just the men, you can do it, come on men. Men thank you so much for listening to me. I know I only have a couple of years left. I love men. One of my best friends is a man I love men, I try to date you guys, and you're so bad at it because you're so sensitive. You guys are so fragile, you're like little butterflies of testosterone. I want to start dating women but I'm not attracted to women So how do I go about that? Do I just start with men shorter than me? Look that was not in the show originally, That joke was not in the show, but then I got some reviewers saying, you know she's edgy, she pulls no punches, and I was like, you want to know what's edgy? Not AIDs, rape, Ebola, abortion taking about men shorter than me. 'Cause that is the last frontier. You do not joke about short men You do not joke about short men A., 'cause that's who runs shit [laughter] And B., I look to the women for support and you can't laugh 'cause that's who you're here with. Those are the keepers. Those are the keepers and look, don't feel bad for short guys okay? Boohoo. Being born with the will to succeed. I actually don't see gender okay? I don't see gender. Once it's below my eye line I just, I don't see it. But I hear gender a lot, especially now that the election's coming up, I hear gender so much. Part of the reason I like the word cunt is because there's no male equivalent to the word cunt, but it's not even the worst of the words. Bitch is way worse than cunt, because if you call someone a cunt It's on you or using that language, If you call someone a bitch, she's a bitch. Right, I mean she's probably a bitch. And the one word that's worse than bitch is, any guesses? >> Slut. >> Crazy. >> Dyke. >> Thank you. [laughter] Someone said it, someone's homophobic, no. Crazy. Crazy is the worst word you can call a woman because it's just dismissive, it mutes her, it denies that bitch a voice. Men will call women crazy for the silliest things, like if we text too much. Men call women crazy if we text too much. But then men can chop off heads and blow up entire cities and what do we call them? Terrorists. A state. Is anyone in here from ISIS? [laughter] It seems very hard to be a woman in ISIS. Just the lack of leadership positons. Very little upward mobility. If you want to blow yourself up as a Jihadista, or Jihadette, I don't know the PC term. I don't know the PC term for female Jihadist but, if you want to blow yourself up as a Jihadista, you have to get permission from a man. That's real, there's a glass burka... in pieces. I know some of you are thinking that would make it see-through but just go with it. It seems very hard for them. After the Paris attacks there was a Jihadian who was blown up, the French police were looking for her cousin, they knocked on her door, they said we know your boyfriend's in there. She said, he's not my boyfriend and then she was blown up. Her last words were, he's not my boyfriend. I was like, sing it sister but. The New York Post, bastion of journalism, covered her the next day, and they actually called her a skank. The headline was, Skanky Suicide Bomber used to be Selfie-talking Party Animal. They took pictures of her partying from her Facebook page and posted them online, they said her nickname was Cowgirl 'cause all the guys used to ride her, they slut-shamed a terrorist. The one woman you could call crazy and get away with it, uh, women cannot have it all. [laughter] As a person I get it, she sucked, I get it. But, as a feminist, I find it kind of problematic. Cat's out of the bag, I'm a feminist, I support equality, I know it's kind of edgy but I support equality. What I don't support are people who just duck out of that conversation Because they're not feminists, rather they are humanists. Sorry I'm not going to weigh on feminism because I'm a humanist, it's like really? Really? I'll be a humanist when we're being chased by machines. [laughter] It's the same people who are like, all lives matter. First of all they don't. [laughter] Second of all they won't until black lives matter, why is that not okay to you, why can't black lives matter? It's like, I'll give you all lives are getting shot, hashtag, it's not as catchy. But all lives are getting shot. Everybody's getting shot, everybody short of NRA lobbyist are getting shot, there are so many mass shootings in 2016 we should just start calling them shootings, it's like why waste words when we don't have time on our side? But when you hear about a shooting, You can pretty much assume it involves a butt load of people, we'll just call those shootings everything else we'll call niche shootings. Niche, niche, niche shootings. Niche shootings. Niche shootings. Artisanal shootings. Single origin. Locally grown. Probably involved an improv tea And a musket in Brooklyn shootings. I'm very optimistic about gun control though. I am very hopeful for the state of gun control in our country, and what gives me hope is the LGBTQ movement, the gay rights movement, because that movement, in just such a short amount of time, has shifted our consciousness in such a progressive, wonderful direction, and I think it's because we all have empathy for that cause, we all know someone who's gay, we've all loved someone who's bi. [laughter] We all know someone who's gay, we've all loved someone who's bi. We all have understanding of that struggle, we have empathy for that cause. So in terms of gun control it's just going to take A little bit of time for us to all know someone who's been shot. I give it a couple of months. But I have hope. The reason I'm even talking about guns Is because guns are a woman's issue. Where there are more guns, more women die, guns are the second most dangerous thing You could have in a house, the only thing more dangerous than guns, men. 67 percent of murders are caused by guns, 90 percent of murders are caused by men. Come on you guys. Look I'm not anti-men, I just think we need a little men control. [applause and cheering] Help us out. Not all men hashtag, not all men. Just need a little men control, maybe spike your Axe body spray with Oxytocin. Just some commonsense regulations. Not all men, hashtag not all men. Just some men. Some loaded men. Loaded men can be very dangerous or, men who want you to think they're loaded which Is why they don't release their tax returns. [cheering] On that note. How are you guys feeling watching America slip into fascism? You guys okay? Is anyone here voting for Trump It's a free country. It won't be. It won't be if he wins. Remember when it was funny? Remember when Donald Trump was funny, Just saying his name was a punchline? All the Tweets, all the jokes. Comparing him to Hitler like, Donald Trump's got nothing on Hitler. Donald Trump's nothing like Hitler, what's Trump ever done to support female directors? And then we started to see that he's kind of like Hitler, people are saluting him like Hitler, he's Tweeting out anti-Semitic propaganda like Hitler, the only difference is that like Hitler served in his military. [laughter] Noise. Best heckle ever. The scariest thing about Trump isn't that he might win, it's that in a way he already has. He has shifted us so far to crazy. He's exposed a vulnerability in our nation that hasn't been exposed since 9/11. Callback. [laughter] He has exposed a vulnerability in our nation that we haven't seen since 9/11. I'm not comparing him to Bin Laden. Well. When you think about it, both did use their daddy's money to fuck up New York's skyline. [applause and cheering] I don't want to talk about Trump too much Because he's a narcissist and I think the best way to defeat a narcissist is to just ignore them. If New York dating has taught me anything. That was just like women groaning, uh. I think the best way to get rid of a narcissist is to just ignore them. But I will say this. If any of you, or anybody watching on Fios if any of you are planning to vote for Donald Trump, when you step into that booth on November 9th. [laughter] When you step into that booth on Wednesday, November 9th. Write that down. Trump supporters, Wednesday, November 9th, when you step into that booth, just think, do you really want somebody so impulsive To have the nuclear codes, because if he has them we all will, They'll just be T-R-U-M-P. And look I don't blame Trump, narcissism is a medical disorder, I don't blame him, I blame the media for using him as click bait, I blame us for not taking him seriously, I blame the GOP, Paul Ryan, Marco Rubio, Satan. By Satan I just mean Ted Cruz but. I'm afraid to say his name three times. Because he might appear. I'm afraid to say Ted Cruz's name three times because he might show up and we have, we're at capacity. Ted Cruz hasn't gone away, he just dropped out to prepare for 2020, like he'll be back they always are, He'll show up when you least expect it like in the shower. But part of me is like, should not be joking about Cruz Because when we joke about them we normalize them and we push them into the mainstream And then they corrupt the mainstream, So it's like should we not be joking about Cruz, Should we not be calling him the Zodiac Killer? That's a person you're talking about. Don't compare him to Ted Cruz. I would actually, I would vote for the Zodiac Killer over Ted Cruz. 'Cause he's never tried to shut down the government. The worst thing about Ted Cruz is that now, I never thought I'd say this, but he is more likable than Trump. I don't know how that happened but I look at Ted Cruz and I'm like, that guy stands for something. That guy's principled. Sure his principles are hastening the Apocalypse So he can get back home to Hell but at least it's something. Trump is way scarier than Cruz because we like Trump, Trump is a reflection of what we value in 2016, Cruz doesn't have one. But. Cruz doesn't have a reflection. But, Trump is a reflection of what we value, we value celebrity, we listen to actors, people paid to say other people's words are who we listen to. Screw Amnesty International, what does Anne Hathaway have to say about the decriminalization of sex work? She should know, 'cause she played a prostitute in Les Mis? No. And look, I like Anne Hathaway, I mean she's a brunette so, she's cool but, celebrities are worse and like, reality stars are worse because they don't have skills, I'm like, I don't want to shit on Kim Kardashian. Unless she pays me. [laughter] I don't want to shit on Kim or Kortney or Khloe Or Kylie or Caitlin or. Or Kendall or. Or Rob. Or Rob but, we're choking on them. We are choking on them, every time you read about a Kardashian, Every time you see a Kardashian on TV, Boko Haram can kidnap another Nigerian girl because there's no political will to stop them Because we're all just Googling Kim's ass. I don't hate. It's like, ha-ha, where's the joke? Ha-ha. Bring back our girls 'cause they're still missing, ha-ha. Hashtag they're still missing but, I don't hate actors or celebrities or, I just think they're destroying America. They are. They actually are if you think about it. When did America start to decline? When the middleclass eroded. Which was when? And I should be careful with rhetorical questions 'cause guys just answer. [laughter] America started to fall when the middleclass eroded, when we started giving tax breaks to the rich hoping that they would trickle down to the poor. The year was 1980, when we elected an actor to be President of the United States of America and thanks to Reaganomics and a trail of poverty and disenfranchisement it left in its place, a golden-haired hydra has just blown up the whole party. I'm thinking about this a lot more now Because I have a niece and I have a nephew. And I am terrified as to the America and the world that they are going to inherit, And we didn't even get to global warming. [laughter] I'm terrified as to the world that they're going to inherit, More my niece 'cause my nephew he's a little white dude, You can just like drop them on their heads And they end up President Bush. But with my niece, you have to be so careful with little girls how we talk to them. It's not okay to tell little girls that they're cute. It's not PC to tell them that they're cute, We're supposed to tell them that they're smart. But my niece is three months old, I don't know if she's smart. [laughter] What if she's an idiot? But I tell her that she's smart and she grows up to have a false sense of confidence, That is way more dangerous than an eating disorder. I would rather a hundred girls grow up to be women with low self-esteem than just one grow up to be Sarah Palin. [laughter] Thanks. And I can't even call her a cunt anymore 'cause she's no longer threatening. But there was a point in American history where Sarah Palin was almost a heartbeat away from being President of the United States, and if that is not a warning sign to what's going on now, or a sign of a broken system, I don't know what is. And I think part of the reason our system's broken, besides the fact that democracy's an illusion, is that what it takes to get elected Is the opposite of what it take to be a good leader. What it takes to get elected is likability. What it takes to be a good leader is being a... Cunt. Bingo. What it takes to get elected is likability, What it takes to be a good leader is being a cunt. Which brings me to Hillary. [cheering and applause] The one C word more offensive to half of America than cunt is Clinton and that's not even her real last name. The one C word more offensive to half of America than cunt is Clinton. Really quickly let's just talk about cunt. Let's just talk, let's just talk you guys, let's just talk about cunt for a second. What is a cunt? It's just that part all women, cisgender women have. It's the birth canal, but also the locust of female pleasure, be it sexual or Presidential. I'm not a biologist. And why are we so afraid of cunt, We're so afraid, it's like, is it because we all have PTSD Because they were the first place we escaped from. They're not going to suck us back in. And now with Hillary, America hates Hillary, America hates Hillary Clinton. It's not 'cause she's a woman, right guys? [laughter] It's not 'cause she's a woman right ladies? Guys, ladies. Why is it though? It's because she's insincere, inauthentic, boring. What was that? >> Her voice. Her voice. Unlikeable. She lies. She's a liar, shrill. Sellout. >> Sellout, all right, all right. America has more words for why we hate Hillary than Inuits have for snow. But it's not 'cause she's a woman right? It's not 'cause she's a woman. If you ask people why they hate her, They'll tell you it's cause she's a bitch or a cunt before they will ever tell you it's because she's a woman. So maybe we'll never know. [laughter] If only there was a way we could gauge America's misogyny. You'd have to construct a social experiment. Just go with me. If you could have Hillary run against the worst candidate known to mankind, so racist and so a threat to national security that even remotely moderate racists wouldn't vote for him, if you could get that guy to run against Hillary, then, and only then, would you really get a sense of what percent of America would rather see a Tweeting asteroid crash into our democracy than a woman lead it. [applause] Thank you. This is all just hypothetical. Wishful thinking. A girl can dream. Not too much. Not too much. Full disclosure, politics aside I love Hillary. I love Hillary Clinton. I love her like I love Lady Macbeth, I just. I love her, like whatever unlikable female protagonist Netflix throws my way, I love Hillary Clinton. And we give her a hard time, we all have skeletons in our emails. Who hasn't killed a friend? She's been accused of killing 50 people and she's still standing, I mean come on, for no other reason that's pretty impressive. And, okay, I felt the Bern too okay? Love Bernie too, I felt the Bern And then I just started drinking cranberry juice And peeing after sex and it went away. But I liked Bernie Sanders a lot as well, and if Bernie had been a young, idealistic Senator from Illinois And it was 2008, I would have totally voted for him. But we've already had hope and change. Now it's time for Hillary. [laughter] That should be her slogan. We've already had hope and change, now it's time for Hillary. Give uninspired a chance. Sign up for Hillary. Instead her slogan is, I'm With Her. She's not a rape victim. Well, she might be. One in six but. Hillary's slogan should just be come on you guys. Am I the man or not? I don't know why I like her so much, It's not 'cause she's already been President. For those of you who thought Bill was President, Uh, not after '98. He was in the doghouse, she was running that ship. I think I like her because I have brand loyalty to Hillary Clinton, she's the brand that I grew up with, She reminds me of the Tampax tampons in my mom's bathroom, those rayon-laded 1980s version of feminism. Shoulder pads for your vagina. The feminine hygiene product for a man's world. Never tested in a lab. Hillary's tampons, whereas Bernie's the diva cup. I know a lot of the guys in here might not know what that is. It's okay, not everything has to be explained to you. [cheering and applause] Hillary's tampon's, Bernie's a diva cup, He may be better for the environment, he may be better for my body, but at the end of the day, I don't want to get blood on my hands. And I think that's what will happen If we don't all get behind not-Trump. Bernie supporters, I'm just guessing by the beards Just call her not-Trump, just call her not-Trump. I'm sorry, I get it, Bernie did a lot of great things for this election, pushing Hillary's politics to the left, I mean so with the wind, But he did a lot of really great things. He did a lot of really great things and now it's time to just let him rest in peace. And I don't mean to talk about Bernie like he's dead. It's not 2018. Feel the Bern. Some of my dear friends feel so upset They're not voting in this election. And it kills me, because Bernie or bust people Fall into two categories, dear friends of mine, and people who bike on the sidewalk. Please stop biking on the sidewalk, you're going to get us all killed. Just get in the bike lane like everybody else. I'm sorry people still drive cars, I'm sorry that every lane isn't a bike lane, I wish every lane were a bike lane But that shit takes time. When a fiery psychopath is about to light our democracy on fire just bite the bullet and give our daughters hope. [laughter] Please. Just think about it, she's been through so much. She's older now, she's wiser now, she has so much experience, she's been through multiple wars. I'm talking about America. Who better to lead her through the twilight of her global supremacy than Hillary Clinton? Or any woman over 60. Any remotely progressive woman over 60. Just think about it strategically, diplomatically, Think about all the meetings they'd be able to eavesdrop on. If no one could see them. Women over 60 should run the world. Or not. I don't even know why I'm thinking about this. It's not like I vote. I'm actually not even political [laughter] I just pretend to be so that people will think I'm young. Because nothing makes you look younger than thinking you can make a difference. [applause and cheering] Thank you guys so much. [music] [music]
