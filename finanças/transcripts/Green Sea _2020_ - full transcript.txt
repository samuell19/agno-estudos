Do you know how to cook? They are looking for a cook. Can I help you? Don't get scared. Good evening. Are you lost? Can I help you? Oh… So, you're here for the job. It's here. Come on in. You'll be cooking simple food for a few steady customers from the neighborhood. His name is Legend. And I am Roula, short for Harris. We introduced ourselves. And you are? Anna. Anna what? Papadopoulou. PAPADOPOULOU COOKIES Well, Anna… I'll pay you 300 euros a month, plus board and lodging. For foreign women, it's important. No rent to pay. Not much, but still much for me. It's okay. Let's start tomorrow and see how it goes. Do you live near here? -Shall I call you a taxi? -No. See you tomorrow. Come. Come! There! You just have to fry these. What about a salad? Who needs a salad here? You only had to fry meatballs! I didn't ask for Peking duck! Anyway, are you a cook or not? I am. Fuck your new players, man! We will meet on Sunday at the game. We'll kick your asses! Nikitas, look! Don't push, you cabman! Get in line! -Where's the ketchup? -I'll get it for you. Serves you right, thief! -This is really yummy. -God sent her. Is it any good? As good as the four goals we scored last Sunday. One more. One is not enough. -It's stuck on my tooth. -Okay, but you'll push my meatballs. He loves rock music and soccer, but he's a nice guy. Just looking at it, it is to die for. Order your own, you starving bastard! Roula! -Get me a portion too. -For me too. Three more portions. -Where did you find the new cook? -Trade secret. -Why do you hide her from us? -He wants her for himself. Here's to the new cook. Roula's cooks are all lousy. That's how it is when you're stingy. Out. No music in here. I said, out. Get out of here, please. Are you nuts? What's your problem with that poor kid, man? He murdered Beethoven's "Fur Elise." You get it? My compliments to the chef. Let me introduce myself. I'm Nikitas the Doctor. I can fix whatever breaks. Electronics, mechanics, plumbing… Your name? Anna. -Anna? -Anna. So, the Beckham of the kitchen, the Bob Marley of meatballs. Would you make me French fries with eggs? Doctor, out! Come on, Annie, my grandma used to make it in Symi. And I'll fix anything for you. The perfect meatball. Spearmint and ouzo. They ate everything but the tables. Where did you learn to cook so well? Where did you work before? In a restaurant. Which one? The Bicycle. The one on Koumoundourou Waterfront? The one with fish and seafood, right? Bicycle, my ass! You think I'm such a jerk? Who the hell are you? I don't know. You don't know what? I don't remember. I don't know who I am. I was at the hospital. Pure honey… So delicious. A great fasting dish. Won't you finish your bean soup? It's a shame, Andreas. I am from Tyrnavos. A proper meal must always have some meat, eggs or cheese. She's a first class cook, so far. Last night, my late wife came to my dreams, complaining that I forgot her. I hadn't seen her for a year. But the potatoes of the new cook awakened my dead wife's jealousy. Where is she from? She's my cousin. Since when do you have a cousin, Roula? -Let's see her. Bring her out. -Bring her out. -Some Georgian cook again. -Make us sausage rolls. They'll eat me alive. Come out, they want to see you. We'll give her an award… Come on, cousin dear. Try some bean soup at least. A ghost might come to you as it did with Thomas. She's swamped right now. Some other time. Sit down. Sit. I've never seen you eat. I only eat bread and cheese. I've lost my sense of taste. How can you cook then? I remember how to cook. Can you taste, at least, salty, sweet and sour? And bitter. It's always there. Why did you send that kid away? Because I hate music and musicians. I was a young promising guitarist, with a scholarship for Vienna. -But I fell in love-- -Nothing works in here. Where did you find this? In the cupboard. Nice. You're both photogenic. From Bach to oriental tunes in bouzouki joints and country fairs. So many years, I enjoyed nothing. Living in cheap B&Bs and underground joints. Meanwhile, my mother had died. I had no idea… All those wasted years… Until he dumped me. So, I'd lost both lover and dope. Sometimes, it's better not to remember. At least I still have my grandma's tavern and Legend. Good night. -So delicious. -Awesome, right? Just like we used to eat it at home. -Just like Maro, right? -She must give you a haircut. Wow, it's very good. Stew, anyone? I want to talk to the cook. -She's very busy. -I have to talk to her. That's how we used to cook it at home. Every first Sunday of the month. We were poor, but with that stew I'd forget all my worries. It gave me strength. That's the way we cooked it. With thick noodles. God bless you, girl. They eat your food and remember. Don't you worry. Keep eating. Good morning. -What's wrong? -I wanted to get out, but it was locked. Right, that Bulgarian cook left with the keys, to get back at me. I'll have another set made. Why did you remove the cover? It's better like this. It doesn't work. Pastry sheets… There's some in the fridge. Wild greens… You'll find them across the street. There's a farmers' market today. Here. Here, come on. Go out and get some fresh air. It'll do you good. Fresh greens. What's up, Andreas? How are you doing? -Wow! Is it working? -No, it's broken. I can fix it for you. No. I can't eat it. It's too bitter. Like poison. Another shitty cook. When I was a kid, I'd pick up greens from graveyards, and eat them raw. I've been through a lot. I lost my grandparents during the occupation. I never met my parents. They died in exile. Communism, the biggest bullshit of the 21st century. Many people fell for it. What's wrong, son? I came from my country to Greece, on foot. -On foot? -Yes. In Evros River, my brother and three friends… dead… Mine field… Blown up in the air… Blood everywhere. The bill, please. For me and Ismael. It's all on me. You said all greens go with feta cheese and onion. You knew it was bitter. Eat it now. I said, eat it. Eat it! So, you can't stand bitter greens either? Why did you do that? Don't you feel sorry for them? Why should I? They eat my food and remember. I remember nothing. If this joint fails, I'll be on the street again. You didn't even think of me. You only think of yourself. I want my life back. Kyriakos Hadjiemmanuel, ex iconographer, now a painter. Harris Anastasiou. Ex musician, now a tavern owner. And this is Anna, a cook and now a cousin of mine. The kind young lady introduced herself. How can I help you, sir? I would love to paint the Garden of Eden, and the front sign. He'll have to stay here for a few days. Forget it. It's hard to find the tavern without a sign. -Where will he paint? Where will he sleep? -I eat like a bird. I can sleep on three chairs in a row. -We have a couch. -And I am a very quick painter. -Meaning? -Within a week, I'll deliver the work. Mr. Roula is known for his hospitality. And I won't be alone. Please. Well, you'll be tidying up your stuff before lunch time. By the end of next week, your work and my hospitality will be over. Is that clear? Anna, I bought you a new apron and some clothes. Here. Thanks. Follow me. Your tea. The Green Sea… The Egyptians never dared to sail it. And out of it, the Garden of Eden will emerge. The key for the front door. And don't forget to lock it. Thank you. You've already started to drip paint. I am sorry. You are right. Wash your brushes in the yard, okay? What are you thinking about? What to cook tomorrow. Make a Green Sea. Spinach with cuttlefish and peppers. Light, healthy and tasty. Who's the lucky one? Two portions left. -Back to the lunchbox again. -It's Maro. She gets mad when I return with a full lunchbox. She thinks that I fancy your cousin. Get me a beer. That's on me. Thanks. Good, huh? -That's on me. -Thank you. He's in high spirits, that cheapo. Your brushes in the yard, not here. Where did you paint before coming here? I haven't painted in two years. I wasn't allowed to paint at the nursing home. They said that the colors smelled. So, I took my brushes and got out of there. I hope they will not look for me. Do you know how incredibly sad I was there, Miss Anna? Then take your time to finish the painting. Aren't you fine here? It's too high for an orange tree. Perhaps a cherry tree would be better… Welcome. -Why are you here? -I heard you have an amazing cook. She's your cousin? Yes. Where is Andreas? He took the twins to the doctor. -What's on the menu today? -Pork loin with honey and prunes. -Anything else? -That's all we have. -Two portions. -No, I'm not hungry. You're just skin and bones. At the hair salon, she couldn't hold her brush. It fell on the client. What will you drink? -A Coke. -Zero? Zero. And a beer for me. A regular beer. Anna, we got caught up in a storm. The hairdresser and her assistant are here. Maro, Andreas' wife with her assistant. Fix two very special portions. -What's wrong with you? -Nothing. Do you want to tell me something? Your bubble gum… I can smell it from here. Is it strawberry? So yummy. You're not going to eat it? It's at least 800 calories. Roula, tell your cousin I want a word with her. Congratulations. Where did you learn to cook so well? At her father's. He had a tavern. Where? Some other time. She's busy now. Come. I worried for nothing. She's not much of a woman. How old do you think she is? I bet she's over 45. -I don't know, Mrs. Maro. -Come on. Go to bed, my child. You don't sleep much either. Sleeping is a waste of time for an old man. But you need sleep. Sleep wipes off what torments the mind. My mind is just empty. Sleep will fill it up again. So go to bed, my child, and have some rest. Good morning. Chef, can you make a special dessert for Stathis? He's got the blues because of the hairdresser. -And he's still a virgin. -I don't know how to make desserts. No love stories here. "That which is done out of love is always beyond good and evil." Hey, why don't you go back to your work? Go now. -The seamstress has PMS. -Don't call him that. I don't like it. Anna, have a look. "The future of nations depends on their dietary habits." "The animals devour, the human beings eat." "But only the intellects know how to eat." It was my grandma's. I had it in the trailer. Impossible with these ancient "okas" and "drammes." I'll buy you a new recipe book. Don't you like the clothes I bought for you? I'll wear them. ANNA ASPIOTI, GREEN SEA 44,000 COPIES It was one of her typical reactions of her cowardice and weakness. She had heard about the Egyptians' fear in the vast Green Sea. The Egyptians were skilled sailors along the Nile. They never dared to sail in the open sea. ANNA ASPIOTI GREEN SEA It's noon. Pack up. The colors are still damp, the inspiration immense. It would be a pity to stop now. The old man is impossible. He paints something, then he erases it. It's hopeless. It's his trick. He just wants to spend the winter here. He is not bothering anyone. Hey, artist, let me tell you something. Paint a fountain under the sycamore tree. -To remind me of my village. -There's no bell on the church. You, Picasso, get me on my moped, not next to it. -Hey, look. I'm like my grandma. -You took after her. Come, let's have a raki together. I can't, son. My heart is weak. -Come on now. -To the Garden of Eden. Bottoms up. Bottoms up, my dear artist. Shame on you. Leave Grandpa alone. What are you doing to him? You morons! Are you nuts? What's all this? How did you pay? I took some money from the box. I didn't spend that much. Give it back, all of it. Now. Keep it from the wages you owe me. -I've never left the kitchen, and-- -Say no more. You pop up in the night like a ghost. You do whatever you like, you're ungrateful. So, starting tomorrow, I do the menu and the shopping. Otherwise, there's the door. Don't forget to leave the keys, like that Bulgarian cook. You won't be missed. -Mr. Roula… -Keep out of this. Anna, I am so sorry… Come on, you ace in cooking. It was a misunderstanding. I didn't mean it. Kyriakos begs you to come back to the Garden of Eden. Whatever you say, from now on. Alright? -Did you fix it? -I plugged it in and it worked. The seamstress was fooling us… I'm sorry. -Here. -Thanks. I had a hard time fixing it, but it's brand new now. -Do you want a drink? -A scotch, please. -We don't have any. -Then some raki… And two glasses. Where's Grandpa? He went to buy some colors. Sit down. Come on… I can't drink alone. You smoke? I didn't know that. I have to go. The game is about to start, my buddies are waiting for me. It goes with your eyes. It was an obedient child. It repressed passions and dreams and buried them deep inside. But passions and dreams take revenge. Anna. -I just had some honey. -So what? I was on a balcony full of blooming daisies. Suddenly, a man approached and kissed me. Who was he? He had no face. I liked the taste of his kiss. I don't know how it is… to fall in love. Forget it. It sucks. Annie, aren't we having a good time here? You got all this place at your feet. It's a jungle out there. Honey pie from Sifnos. Thank you. Here. At least 65 calories per bite. -Just a little bit. -I gained 800 grams this week. Do you know how long I had to wait to kiss Eleni? She was too shy. But I did it, one day. Nothing spectacular. It was in a pastry cafe. Over a custard pie. You know, I had the time of my life in Sifnos. In Sifnos? When? With whom? You don't need to know everything. Why? Are you hiding things from me? -Give me a break. I was with Rena. -What a chick. You lady-killer. You can't do that. The spice of passion. Come on, Maro! Great, Mrs. Maro. Music is forbidden here. I am a hotshot and I do whatever I like! Cut it out! If I didn't have the hair business, we would be starving. Chili with Greek sausages. It's not a Mexican dish. They almost burnt the place down. Enough with your bullshit! From now on, we decide on the menu together. Are you okay? He would turn 75 today. He died before celebrating his birthday. I wanted to honor him with an exotic menu. How will we bury him like this? He didn't have any decent clothes. -It's not important anymore. -It is. He won't travel in rags. He'll go like a gentleman. Get in. You might find something decent for Kyriakos. What do you need all this for? How can you sleep in here? Find something for him. God rest his soul. -Ismael, cheers. -Cheers. Grandpa was such a talent. He painted me just like I am. Look at Roula. He even painted the dog. What about you? Did he forget you? -What's wrong? -Roula. What is it? -Where is Roula? -No idea. In the trailer. -Roula. -Where are you going? GREEN SEA Next summer, we'll set the tables by the sea. I'll need an assistant. Here. Kyriakos' watch is nice. It suits you. And how are you? I see things, but I don't know if it's real or my imagination. I have no memory, a child with a grown-up's mind. That's good. I got used to being here. But I'd like to go out, have a drink, dance… go for a walk… I'll close and we go wherever you like. I can't. I have other plans. Cheers, Roula! Cheers, everyone. Here's to Olympiacos F.C.! To Anna! Cheers, Anna! Congrats, Anna. You're a great cook. I had so much fun. Thank you. -Can you give me your number? -I don't have a phone. You are the first woman asking me to take her to the fair in wintertime. I am that woman. What's here? The castle of ghosts? -Number 4. -Four. Anna. What's wrong? Some water… I'm not feeling well. I'm thirsty. Let's go out. The sea will make you feel much better. No… I can't live without the sea. I can. I lost my father in the sea. He was only 40. Good morning. Where were you all night? I was worried sick, and you were fucking. What's your problem? Are you jealous? Of whom? That low-class disposable jerk? -It's lunch time and nothing is ready yet. -Go away. The best omelet ever. Just the way I like it. No ham nor cheese, nothing. -Perfect. -Very good. Roula, you're really lucky. She's the best. The Green Sea… The Egyptians never dared to sail in it. Anna Aspioti, born in Syros, studied literature and cultural anthropology. Her acclaimed novels have been translated in many languages. We are home. GREEN SEA Hello. At last. The book is almost out. Where are you? -Did you finish the book? -No. What have you been doing? Cooking. Ideas? No, I had an adventure, a nightmare. I must tell you all about it, I'm coming over. Anna, I'm really busy right now. I'll call you tomorrow, okay? Bye now. Open up. We're hungry. -He fucked up again. -Let's go to have some souvlaki. Let's go, guys. Can I have a glass of raki, please? CAFÉ -Let's go somewhere else. -It's nice here. -A cappuccino. -Only Greek coffee. He is paranoid. Horrible. How did you survive? The cooking every day, all that routine, helped me. Come on now. I was busy all day long, sleeping like a log at night. I had forgotten that I couldn't remember. You are still in shock… But you're strong enough to get over it. Unbelievable… Everyone knows you, no one is looking for you. Not even your best friend. I thought you were somewhere writing your book. Your book. The assignment. Thrillers set in exotic places sell well and help readers to forget their misery. -I can't finish it. -Anna, don't think too much of this. Wrap it up, and then write about your adventure. An amnesiac writer… cooking for workers and truck drivers. A genuine best seller. I can't. It's like exposing your own family. What are you doing there? A JOURNEY IN HONG KONG FISH TAVERN
