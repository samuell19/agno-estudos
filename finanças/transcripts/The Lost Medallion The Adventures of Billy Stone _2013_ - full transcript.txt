CAN I JUST LEAVE THEM ON THE TABLE? OH, THANK YOU, DANIEL. THAT'S FINE. CAN YOU STAY FOR A WHILE? I'M ACTUALLY ON MY WAY TO SEE THE GAME AT THE STADIUM. THE PLAYOFFS? YEAH. RIGHT BEHIND THE DIG-OUT. WELL, LOOK AT YOU. [CHUCKLES] HOW ARE YOU? I'M GOOD. I SEE A FEW KIDS I'VE NOT SEEN BEFORE. YEAH, WE BROUGHT THREE MORE IN FROM OTHER FOSTER HOMES. MY HEART JUST GOES OUT TO THEM. IT'S NEVER EASY FOR THEM TO ADJUST. THAT'S BILLY OVER THERE, UNDER THE TREE. HARDLY EVER SAYS A WORD. AND THEN THERE'S ALLIE, LITTLE GIRL WITH THE RED HAIR. SO INSECURE. SHE SAID TO ME THE OTHER DAY "DO YOU THINK GOD EVER MAKES PEOPLE BY ACCIDENT." [SIGHS] I JUST WANTED TO MELT. AND THEN, THAT'S HUKO, THE BOY IN THE BLUE. WE'VE HAD A LITTLE TROUBLE WITH HIM. HE LIKES TO BE KING AROUND HERE. I'M GONNA KNOCK HOME RUN ON THAT BOY, BE RIGHT BACK. HUKO! HUKO, GIVE ME THE BAT. ARE YOU HERE TO TELL US A STORY? A STORY? WE ALWAYS HEAR STORIES ON TUESDAY. I'M SORRY, DANIEL. LISA, MS. JESSIE ISN'T FEELING WELL TODAY, SHE'LL BE HERE NEXT WEEK, OKAY? WILL YOU TELL US ONE? UM, I DON'T THINK MY STORY'D BE AS GOOD AS MS. JESSIE'S. OH, WELL, THAT'S OK. COME ON, COME ON, COME ON EVERYONE! COME ON, COME ON, IT'S STORY TIME. IT'S STORY TIME! YEAH! AWESOME! ARE YOU SURE YOU HAVE TIME? UM, A LITTLE TIME, YES. A STORY, NO. HEY, GET OUT OF MY SEAT. OK, STORY TIME, HUKO COOL IT, WALKING STICK, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DANIEL, I'M GONNA GO FIX THEIR SNACKS WHILE YOU TELL THE STORY. OK. SO, WHAT KIND OF STORY IS THIS? TELL A SCARY ONE! NO, TELL A FUNNY ONE! JUST DON'T MAKE IT BORING. WHY WOULD IT BE BORING? IT'S NOT GONNA BE BORING, IT'S GONNA BE FUNNY. OK, I'VE GOT A STORY. IT'S A LITTLE BIT SCARY, IT'S A LITTLE BIT FUNNY, AND IT'S GOT A LOT OF ACTION. YES! THIS STORY IS CALLED, "THE LOST MEDALLION". COOL! SO, WHAT'S A MEDALLION? ISN'T THAT LIKE A BIG PIECE OF FRUIT. NO-THAT'S A MELON. OH. A MEDALLION IS SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL THAT YOU PUT AROUND YOUR NECK. LIKE A GOLD MEDAL. YES, LIKE A GOLD MEDAL, BUT THIS ONE, WAS MAGICAL. NOW THIS STORY HAS THREE VERY SPECIAL KIDS IN IT. THE FIRST, IS A YOUNG PRINCE NAMED HUKO. HEY, THAT'S MY NAME! THE SECOND WAS A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL NAMED ALLIE. AND THE THIRD WAS A CLEVER BOY NAMED BILLY. HEY, THAT BOY OVER THERE IS NAMED BILLY. HEY, IS YOUR NAME REALLY BILLY? YOU MAY WANNA COME HEAR THIS STORY. HE DOESN'T TALK A LOT. I DON'T THINK HE'S VERY SMART. WELL, I KNOW A LOT OF SMART PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY QUIET. AND I KNOW SOME PEOPLE WHO TALK TOO MUCH EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT VERY SMART. YEAH, YOU TALK ALL THE TIME. OK, NOW LISTEN UP. OUR STORY BEGINS A LONG, LONG TIME AGO, ON A FAR, FAR AWAY ISLAND. A KIND-HEARTED KING MELTED DOWN HIS CROWN AND SHAPED IT INTO A MEDALLION WITH A SPECIAL STONE IN THE MIDDLE. THE KING DID THIS TO SHOW HIS PEOPLE THAT EVERYBODY WAS IMPORTANT, AND THAT NO ONE PERSON WAS BORN GREATER THAN ANOTHER. BECAUSE OF THIS HUMBLE ACT, THE MEDALLION TOOK ON SPECIAL POWERS, GRANTING WISHES TO THE PURE IN HEART. WITH THIS POWERFUL MEDALLION, THE KING USED IT TO GROW CROPS FROM BARREN SOIL. HE SAVED HIS PEOPLE FROM DEADLY STORMS. THE KING EVEN PROTECTED HIS VILLAGE FROM AN EVIL WARLORD'S INVADING ARMIES. BUT ONE DAY, THE KING'S PRIDEFUL SON, HUKO, TOOK THE MEDALLION AND LOST THE STONE, CAUSING IT TO LOSE ITS POWER. WITHOUT THE POWER OF THE STONE TO PROTECT THE ISLAND, THE EVIL WARLORD COBRA, CONQUERED THE PEACEFUL PEOPLE. BUT JUST BEFORE HE SEIZED THE MEDALLION, THE GOOD KING RESCUED IT, AND ESCAPED. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [AMBIENT NATURE SOUNDS] [MUSIC] [POW!] WHERE IS IT? [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [POW!] (YOUNG GIRL) DID THE KING DIE? (DANIEL - STORYTELLER) YES. (YOUNG BOY) WHAT ABOUT THE MEDALLION? (DANIEL - STORYTELLER) WELL, THE MEDALLION STAYED HIDDEN FOR A LONG TIME. NO ONE FOUND IT, EVEN THOUGH MANY PEOPLE LOOKED FOR IT. AND THAT BRINGS US TO THE NEXT PART OF THE STORY, AND A YOUNG BOY NAMED BILLY. [MUSIC] I WANT YOU OUT OF HERE. I SAID I WANT YOU OFF THIS SITE, RIGHT NOW. LET ME HELP YOU. YOU CAN'T HELP. I CAN CLEAN TOOLS, TAKE NOTES, GET COFFEE, DIG HOLES. YOU'RE TOO YOUNG FOR THIS KIND OF WORK. I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU NEED. PROMISE? YEAH, I PROMISE. GO HOME. BUT DAD, THERE'S NO ONE THERE. AH, YOU KNOW, WE COULD USE AN ARCHEOLOGIST LIKE YOU ON OUR TEAM. COBB APPRECIATES YOUR TALENTS WHILE CERTAIN OTHERS DO NOT. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? GIVE ME THAT. GET LOST YOU LITTLE BRAT! WHAT DO YOU THINK, MR. COBB? OUR FAMILIES HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR THE MEDALLION FOR GENERATIONS. BUT THIS KID, HE'S ONTO SOMETHING. KEEP AN EYE ON HIM. NOT TO WORRY, WE COME FROM A LONG LINE OF TRACKERS. [MUSIC] [SPLASH!] OH... HEY, YOU KNOW, YOU WEREN'T CREATED TO FLY, AT LEAST NOT LIKE THAT. YOU KNOW, FROM THAT HEIGHT, AT YOUR WEIGHT, YOU'D NEED AT LEAST FOUR-AND-A-HALF TIMES MORE SURFACE AREA. WHERE'D YOU GET THAT IDEA? IT'S AMAZING WHAT YOU CAN FIND IN A BOOK. YOU SHOULD OPEN ONE SOMETIME. WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR CAN'T BE FOUND IN A BOOK. DID YOU GET KICKED OUT AGAIN? YEAH. MY DAD'S NEVER GONNA LET ME JOIN HIM. WELL, DID YOU FIND ANYTHING INTERESTING? NOTHING... YET... BUT SOMEDAY THE ENTIRE WORLD WILL BE CHANGED WHEN I FIND THE MEDALLION. WHEN WE FIND THE MEDALLION. AND SO, THE SPIDER SEES THE FLY. [MUSIC] WELL, SEE YOU TOMORROW. BYE. HEY, I ALMOST FORGOT, I FOUND THIS AT A USED BOOKSTORE. IT'S SOME KIND OF ANTIQUARIAN JOURNAL ABOUT OUR ISLAND. A WHAT JOURNAL? AN OLD JOURNAL. YOU SHOULD GIVE IT A READ, YOU MIGHT FIND SOMETHING KIND OF INTERESTING. SEE YA. HEY, HOW WAS SCHOOL TODAY. [MUSIC] DAD, YOU OKAY? IT'S OVER BILLY. WHAT'S OVER? COBB SHUT ME DOWN. YOU OWE THE BANK, NOT HIM. HE IS THE BANK, BILLY. HE NOW OWNS EVERYTHING NOW, INCLUDING THE DIG SITE. I GIVE UP. NO DAD YOU CAN'T GIVE UP! WE CAN'T GIVE UP. I'VE LOST EVERYTHING FOR WHAT? FOR SOME NON-EXISTENT MEDALLION. YOU KNOW MOM WOULD TELL YOU THAT IT EXISTS. IT'S IN THE GROUND SOMEWHERE, I CAN FEEL IT, I KNOW IT. EVERYTHING THAT HAS EVER MEANT ANYTHING TO ME. IT'S ALL BURIED IN THE GROUND. [MUSIC] BILLY, I WANT YOU TO HAVE THIS. IT'S BEEN IN MY FAMILY FOR A LONG TIME. AND I KNOW, IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE MUCH, BUT THERE IS SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL ABOUT IT. I LOVE YOU, HONEY. HE'S READING A BOOK. RIGHT, WELL, WE SLEEP NOT, TILL THIS MISSION BE COMPLETE. [NOISES] [WHACK!] [SCREAMING] WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?? I WAS GONNA ASK YOU THAT! I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU. I'M GONNA RUN AWAY. WHAT? WHY? I WANT TO FIND MY MOM. YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE SHE IS. I KNOW WHERE SHE ISN'T, THE ORPHANAGE. READ ANYTHING INTERESTING? NO, I HAVEN'T EVEN READ IT YET. LISTEN, PROMISE ME THAT YOU WON'T RUN AWAY AND WE'LL READ IT TOGETHER. READ THIS ONE, JUNE 18TH, 1827. ENTRY BY MOHEYA, SHE'S THE ONE WHO WROTE THIS JOURNAL. "HIS EYES ARE FILLED WITH THE PASSION OF WAVES "ON A SUMMER DAY, HIS ARMS ARE AS STRONG AS THE MOUNTAINS." THERE'S NO WAY, I'M READING THIS ROMANTIC STUFF. TRY THIS ONE. "ROCKS FELL FROM THE ANGRY FACE OF THE MOUNTAINS, FILLING OUR VALLEY WITH SADNESS..." WE LL? WE LL WHAT? IT'S JUST A BUNCH OF GUSHY POETRY. DON'T YOU SEE IT? "ROCKS FELL"? SHE'S TALKING ABOUT AN EARTHQUAKE! EXACTLY. NOW, THIS IS WHERE YOU SAY "I SEE THE VALUE OF BOOKS NOW". "WHAT ONCE WAS A SHORT WALK, BECAME A VERY LONG ONE." WE LL? WE LL WHAT? THE EARTHQUAKE MOVED IT. THE EARTHQUAKE MOVED THE MEDALLION? NOT THE MEDALLION, THE RIVER. HERE... YEAH, I SEE IT. [CHUCKLES] DEJO. DEJO! [BOTH SCREAM] DAD'S BEEN LOOKING ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE RIVER! DON'T GO WITHOUT ME, OK? BILLY, WHY WON'T YOU JUST BUY ONE OF THOSE? I MEAN LOOK AT IT, IT'S HALF BROKEN! BECAUSE, THEY'RE MORE FUN TO MAKE. I THINK THIS IS THE PATH HE CAME DOWN. WELL, LOGICALLY, YES. [BEEP, BEEP, BEEP, LONG BEEP] [MUSIC] I SWEAR, IF I FIND ONE MORE SPOON- YOU'LL PROBABLY FIND THAT ONE AGAIN. [BEEP, BEEP, BEEP] [BEEP, BEEP, BEEP... LONG BEEP] KEEP LOOKING BUFFOONS! FIND THAT MEDALLION OR ELSE! NO TIME TO REST, KEEP LOOKING! OK, LETS GO. HEY! I THINK I FOUND SOMETHING! OVER HERE! [BEEP, BEEP, BEEP] [LONG BEEP] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [GUSTS OF WIND] KING KIELI'S EMBLEM. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] WE FOUND IT! YEAH. OH, JUST WAIT TILL MY DAD SEES THIS. A SERENDIPITOUS DAY, IS IT NOT? I BELIEVE YOU HAVE WHAT IS OURS. MAY WE GIVE YOU A RIDE INTO TOWN? COME ON, ALLIE! SEIZE THEM! GET BACK HERE! [DRAMATIC MUSIC] GET BACK HERE! [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [SCREAMS] GET BACK HERE! HALT! STOP!

[DRAMATIC MUSIC] GO BILLY GO! GO BILLY GO! [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [CRASH!] [EXPLOSION!] WOW, I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE LOOK ON YOUR DAD'S FACE, HE'S GONNA BE SO EXCITED! I KNOW! OH, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. BILLY, WHAT IS THAT? OH MY GOSH! THE STONE! IT REALLY IS SPECIAL! ALLIE, COME ON, LETS GO SHOW MY DAD! WAIT, YOU SHOULD PUT IT ON! YOU SHOULD SURPRISE HIM! YEAH! [DRAMATIC MUSIC] 'TIS GOOD FOR A FAMILY TO BE TOGETHER. GAVE US A GOOD CHASE. JUST GIVE ME THE MEDALLION. NO! HE DOESN'T HAVE THE MEDALLION- DAD - HE'S JUST A KID. I'M THE ARCHEOLOGIST HERE. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] (YOUNG GIRL) DID THE BAD GUYS TAKE THE MEDALLION FROM BILLY? WELL, I'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU. I WOULDN'T HAVE SHOWN IT TO THEM. I WOULD HAVE KEPT IT HIDDEN. (YOUNG GIRL) BUT HE WANTED TO SHOW IT TO HIS DAD. (YOUNG BOY) BUT IF THE BAD GUYS TAKE IT FROM HIM, IT DOESN'T MATTER. I WOULD HAVE KEPT IT FOR MYSELF. (YOUNG GIL) WHAT HAPPENED? WERE THEY CAPTURED? WHO GOT THE MEDALLION? WELL, THINGS DIDN'T LOOK GOOD FOR BILLY AND ALLIE. EVERYONE SAW THE MEDALLION, AND THE BAD GUYS WANTED IT. BUT NO ONE WAS READY FOR WHAT HAPPENED NEXT. ONE OF THE THUGS LOOKED AT BILLY AND SAID... "COME ON KID, GIVE IT HERE." NO! YOU'RE GOING TO WISH YOU'D GIVEN IT TO US. YOU KNOW WHAT I WISH? I WISH THAT THIS WHOLE MESS HAD NEVER HAPPENED! WHAT JUST HAPPENED? IT WORKS. WHERE ARE WE? NOT WHERE: WHEN. ALLIE, I THINK WE'RE BACK IN TIME. BILLY, I KNOW THAT THIS MAY LOOK GOOD, BUT THIS IS REALLY NOT GOOD. RELAX. WHAT COULD GO WRONG? OH, I DON'T KNOW, WHAT DO YOU THINK?! LETS GO. [AMBIENT SOUNDS WITH MUSIC] ALLIE, ALLIE LOOK! WE'RE SEEING THE VILLAGE THAT MY DAD HAS BEEN DIGGING UP ALL THESE YEARS. WISH US BACK! RIG HT NOW! MAKE WAY FOR THE GREAT HUKO. HEY THERE. AW, HE'S SO CUTE. HE'S SO CUTE! WHO ARE YOU? I'M BILLY, AND THIS IS ALLIE. HI. [GIGGLES] YOUR ROBE HAS TEETH. THE MEDALLION! AT LAST! OUR MEDALLION HAS BEEN RETURNED BY OUR NEW KING! [APPLAUSE] I AM KING! I AM KING! PLEASE STAY FOR DINNER, OUR MOST HONORED RADIANCE. ME, AN "HONORED RADIANCE"? REALLY? I'M SORRY, WE REALLY, REALLY HAVE TO GET BACK... WE'RE STAYING! [APPLAUSE] WE'RE STAYING. [MUSIC WITH CELEBRATORY SOUNDS] I WANT MY THRONE BACK. NOW! LET ME THINK ABOUT THAT. HMM... I DON'T THINK SO. YOU'RE NO KING. THEY THINK I AM. OH, THANK YOU. AH...[IN DISGUST] ARE YOU GONNA EAT THOSE? ALL YOURS. AH...[IN DISGUST] [MUSIC] THANK YOU FOR RETURNING THE SYMBOL OF OUR WORTH. THE MUSIC IN OUR HEARTS PLAY AGAIN. MOHEA, YOU MUST NOT SPEAK DIRECTLY TO OUR GUEST. SOME OF US NEVER LEARNED THE TRUE MEANING OF THE ROYAL MEDALLION. UH, WAIT. YOU' RE MOHEA? I LOVE YOUR WRITINGS. I DON'T WRITE. TRUST ME, YOU WILL. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] THE MEDALLION HAS BEEN FOUND MY LORD. WHERE? A STRANGER BROUGHT IT TO THEM, AND NOW HE'S THE KING. I AM THEIR KING. THEY DON'T KNOW THAT. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] PREPARE MY OUTRIGGERS. YES, MY LORD. YOU ARE VERY KIND. AND YOU ARE VERY BEAUTIFUL. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] I KNOW THE MEDALLION BROUGHT YOU HERE, GIVE IT TO ME. I AM HUKO, SON OF KING KIELI! IT SHOULD ONLY BE WORN BY THE ISLAND'S RIGHTFUL KING. YOU KNOW, I'M BEGINNING TO THINK THE MEDALLION WANTS ME TO BE KING. MAYBE BECAUSE I WON'T LOSE IT. WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT. IN MY GREAT MERCY I WILL FORGIVE YOU. COME ON ALLIE, LETS GO BACK TO MY VILLAGE. GIVE ME THE MEDALLION. NO. IT'S MINE! I DON'T THINK SO! I LOST MY FATHER OVER IT. SO DID I! STOP IT OK! JUST STOP FIGHTING! THIS IS A KING? YOU HAVE SOMETHING I WANT. I BANISH YOU! STOP OR SHE DIES! I TOLD YOU JUST TO WISH US BACK! LET HER GO AND I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU. FIRST THE MEDALLION. JUMP! [DRAMATIC MUSIC] I WISH YOU DEAD! [MUSIC] BRING US BACK MORE SLAVES. YES, MY LORD. WHERE ARE MY TRACKERS? TRACKERS! BRING ME THEIR DEAD BODIES. WITH HEARTY DISPATCH, MY LORD. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] WE DID IT YOU GUYS! YOU GUYS WE'RE ALIVE! WE'RE ALIVE! WE HAVE TO GO AFTER THE MEDALLION. WE GO TO COBRA'S ISLAND. WE TAKE BACK THE MEDALLION. AND HOW EXACTLY DO WE DO THAT? THERE'S ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR OF US AND, LIKE, AN ENTIRE ARMY OF THEM. WHO DO YOU THINK YOU'RE TALKING TO? A SPOILED BRAT. HE'S RIGHT... NOT THAT YOU'RE A SPOILED BRAT, BUT THAT WE CAN'T DO THIS ALONE. THE ONLY CHANCE WE HAVE IS WITH FALEAKA. NO ONE'S SEEN HIM SINCE MY FATHER'S DEATH. WELL MY FATHER AND I HAVE BEEN TO HIS HUT MANY TIMES. I'M GOING TO FIND OUT WHAT WE SHOULD DO. KING COBRA, KING COBRA, KING COBRA, KING COBRA, KING COBRA. [CHANTING] NOW YOU ARE TRULY INVINCIBLE MY LORD. [MUSIC] FALEAKA LIVES UP THERE. FIRST ONE TO THE TOP IS KING. YOU DIDN'T SAY GO! HE DIDN'T EVEN SAY GO! HEY YOU GUYS! YOU GUYS! THERE'S A PATH OVER HERE! COME ON, ANUI. [MUSIC] I AM KING BECAUSE MY HAND TOUCHED FIRST. HAND DOESN'T COUNT. IT HAS TO BE A FOOT. I WON, I'M KING. LOOK FALEAKA DOESN'T LIVE HERE. HE'S DEAD. (DANIEL - STORYTELLER) AFTER ALMOST LOSING THEIR LIVES, BILLY KNEW THAT THEIR ONLY HOPE TO REGAIN THE MEDALLION WAS TO GET HELP FROM THE WISEST MAN THAT LIVED ON THE ISLAND AT THAT TIME. AN OLD MAN NAMED FALEAKA, WHO LIVED IN A SECRET PLACE AWAY FROM THE VILLAGE. COME ON. [MUSIC] [KNOCK ON DOOR] [PARROT SPEAKS] "COME ON IN." FALEAKA... FALEAKA... WE NEED YOUR HELP TO... TO REGAIN THE MEDALLION. LEAVE! GO BACK TO THE VILLAGE. BUT WE NEED YOUR HELP. I WILL NOT HELP SOMEONE TO THEIR DEATH. LOOK AT HIM. HE CAN'T HELP US. MY DAD WOULD HAVE WANTED ME TO COME TO YOU FOR YOUR WISDOM. WE'RE GOING AFTER THE MEDALLION. WITH OR WITH OUR YOUR HELP. [LAUGHTER] WELL I GUESS IT IS BETTER TO FIGHT LIKE TIGERS THAN TO LIVE LIKE KITTY CAT. I LIKE YOU, I USED TO BE LIKE YOU. ONCE UPON A TIME. I'LL HELP YOU. BEHOLD! THE WAY TO DEFEAT THE COBRA. ALLIE, I WANT YOU TO MAKE YOUR PINEAPPLE EXPLODE. EXPLODE? HOW? THAT IS FOR YOU TO DECIDE. THAT IS FOR YOU TO DECIDE. THINK CAREFULLY. [BANG!] IT WORKED! ANUI, I WANT YOU TO SPLIT YOUR PINEAPPLE INTO TWO PARTS. MAKE ONE HALF OF IT TASTE AS GOOD AS YOU CAN, AND THE OTHER HALF TASTE AS BAD AS YOU CAN. [BURP, GAGGING, THROWS UP] THAT'S DISGUSTING. HUKO, I WANT YOU TO CUT THIS PINEAPPLE INTO ONE HUNDRED PIECES. EACH PIECE THE SAME SIZE. WHAT ABOUT BILLY? IT'S UP IN THE TREE. WAY UP THERE, GET ME THAT PINEAPPLE. [GRUNTING] WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THESE STUPID PIECES? SERVE YOUR FRIENDS. OK, FIRST OF ALL, THEY'RE NOT MY FRIENDS. AND SECOND, I AM SUPPOSED TO BE SERVED. I AM KING. A VERY WISE MAN ONCE SAID, "A TRUE GREAT KING WILL FIND THE COURAGE TO SERVE OTHERS" WHAT FOOL SAID THAT? YOUR FATHER. NOW, EVERYTHING HAS A PURPOSE AND A DESIGN. I... I HEAR VOICES. NO, NOT IN MY HEAD, IN MY EARS. WE MUST GET TO THE BOATS. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] GET ME DOWN THERE! NOW WHAT DO WE DO BILLY? WHAT DO YOU MEAN NOW WHAT? WE STAY AND FIGHT! WE DON'T HAVE ANY WEAPONS. OR WE CAN JUST WAIT FOR THEM TO JUST THROW US OFF THE CLIFF. ANUI, YOU'RE BRILLIANT. HUKO, YOU GO GRAB THOSE VINES, ANUI AND ALLIE, YOU TWO GO GRAB THOSE ONES. [MUSIC] WE HAVE TO GET DOWN THERE! GET DOWN THERE! GET-ME-DOWN-THERE! [MUSIC] [EXCITED SCREAMS] HOLD ON TIGHT GUYS! [EXCITED SCREAMS] YAY, LET'S DO THAT AGAIN. I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT WORKED. DO YOU HAVE ANY ROYAL BLOOD IN YOU? I DON'T KNOW. I'M AN ORPHAN, BUT, YOU KNOW, I COULD DO SOME RESEARCH. IF YOU WERE ROYAL, YOU WOULD KNOW. I COULD GO TO THE LIBRARY. THEY'VE GOT TONS OF BOOKS THERE THAT HAVE INFORMATION... YOU WOULD KNOW. YOU KNOW, I DO KNOW THIS... YOU'RE A JERK. NO, I'M NOT. WHAT'S A JERK? YOU HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE BETTER THAN US. I AM. I AM A KING. THAT'S JUST A TITLE. WHAT'S UNDER THAT SKIN OF YOURS? SOMEONE VERY SPECIAL. YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT. BECAUSE IF YOU DID, YOU WOULD TREAT EVERYONE JUST AS SPECIAL. SOME OF US LEARN FASTER THAN OTHERS. [CHUCKLES] I ORDAIN MY ENEMIES TO DIE. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] I WISH FOR THAT ISLAND... PLEASE, MY LORD. MY MEN. I DECREE FOR THAT ISLAND TO BE DESTROYED BY FIRE FROM THE SKY. [SCREAMS] NO. ADVISOR! I WANT MY ADVISOR! WHY WON'T THE MEDALLION WORK FOR ME? WHY!? THE MOON. IT IS NOT YET FULL. I DON'T BELIEVE YOU. IT NEEDS TO REST SQUARELY ON YOUR NECK. TELL ME THE TRUTH AND I WILL DO YOU NO HARM. THE MEDALLION ONLY WORKS ON A KIND HEART. ARE YOU SAYING MY HEART IS NOT KIND? [DRAMATIC MUSIC] WHY WOULD YOU SAY A THING LIKE THAT? BRING ME A NEW ADVISOR. STOP. ANSWER THIS AND YOU WILL KNOW BETTER HOW TO DEFEAT THE COBRA. IT'S NEVER SEEN, BUT ALWAYS FELT. IT'S COLD, SOMETIMES MELTS. STRENGTH AND POWER FOUND INSIDE. WHERE WORTH AND PURPOSE BOTH RESIDE. COME. YOU'VE LED US RIGHT TO COBRA'S WARRIORS. AND TO THEIR BOATS. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE, LETS GO. GET IN THE BOAT, GET IN THE BOAT. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] HERE THEY COME. HURRY! PADDLE, PADDLE! I'M GOING AS FAST AS I CAN. PADDLE BILLY! GO, GO, GO, GO, GO, FASTER GO. PADDLE, PADDLE. PADDLE COME ON! THEY'RE CATCHING UP, COME ON! [WHOAH, WHOAH, UH, UH...] [CHUCKLES] GOOD WORK BILLY, THEY'RE SINKING. [CHUCKLES] HOW COULD YOU LET THEM ESCAPE! DO YOU KNOW WHAT COBRA'S GONNA DO TO US? DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S GONNA DO TO US? I'M AN IDIOT. I'M AN IDIOT! THAT'S THE FIRST CORRECT THING YOU'VE SAID ALL DAY. [FRUSTRATED GROAN] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] HEY GUYS! THANK YOU, ALLIE, FOR WAITING UP FOR AN OLD MAN. TELL ME ABOUT BILLY'S FAMILY. WELL HE JUST LOST HIS MOM TO CANCER, AND HE'S LOST HIS DAD TO HER DREAM, FINDING THE MEDALLION. WHAT ABOUT YOUR FAMILY? IT'S NOT MUCH OF A FAMILY. MY MOTHER TOLD ME EVERY DAY OF MY LIFE THAT I WAS AN ACCIDENT. BEFORE SHE LEFT ME AT THE ORPHANAGE. ALLIE, YOU MAY HAVE BEEN AN ACCIDENT TO YOUR MOTHER, BUT YOU WERE NO ACCIDENT TO GOD. HE CREATED YOU FULL OF MEANING. [MUSIC] ANUI, COME ON! [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [CRYING] THEY ARE NOT DEAD. NOW'S THE TIME FOR TIGER'S COURAGE, OK? WE GO FIND THEM, COME. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] THIS IS HUMILIATING. YEAH? WELL NOW YOU KNOW HOW IT FEELS TO BOW. WHAT SHOULD WE DO NOW, SMART ONE? HIDE. ALLIE. LIKE A TIGER, NOT A KITTY CAT. OK, OK. I HAVE A PLAN. (ALLIE) HEY YOU GUYS. YOU GUYS. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [FUNNY SOUNDS] [POP, POP, POP!] ALLIE! I ALMOST GOT IT. ALLIE LOOK OUT! ALLIE! I KNOW! COME on GUYS, LET'S so, so, so, so, COME on LETS so! OH, I'M A HELPLESS OLD MAN. PLEASE FORGIVE ME. [GRUNTS AND YELLS] [POW!] [FUNNY NOISES] [GRUNTS AND YELLS] [POW!] COME ON. WAIT. I HAVE BEEN WITH YOU FOR A WHILE NOW, AND YOUR STRENGTHS ARE EASY TO SEE. MY FATHER NEVER SAW THEM. HE DID, BUT HE WAS PROBABLY TOO PREOCCUPIED TO TELL YOU. I THOUGHT THAT WHEN I FOUND THE MEDALLION, I WOULD FIND MEANING. BILLY, YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT SOMETIMES WHAT YOU ARE SEEKING IS ALREADY INSIDE YOU. BANG! [UGH!] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [POW!] WHY WOULD YOU DIE FOR ME? BECAUSE A GREAT KING ONCE DIED FOR ME. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] (YOUNG GIRL) FALEAKA DIED? (DANIEL - STORYTELLER) YES. FALEAKA DIED. HE STEPPED IN FRONT OF THE ARROW THAT WOULD HAVE KILLED BILLY. HE DEMONSTRATED THE GREATEST KIND OF LOVE... GIVING YOUR LIFE FOR SOMEONE ELSE. I DON'T THINK I COULD DO THAT. NOT MANY PEOPLE WOULD. IT TAKES A LOT OF LOVE AND A LOT OF COURAGE TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT. (YOUNG GIRL) WHAT DID THEY DO? DID THEY GIVE UP? (YOUNG BOY) NO. THEY CAN'T GIVE UP OR IT WOULD BE A CRUMMY STORY. (YOUNG GIRL) 1 WOULD GIVE UP. I DON'T THINK THEY CAN FIGHT AN ENTIRE ARMY. THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE THE MEDALLION. WHAT ABOUT FALEAKA? DID THEY BURY HIM? THEY DID BURY HIM, AND THEY CRIED FOR A WHILE, AND THEN DECIDED THAT THEY NEEDED A PLAN. [MUSIC] SO NOW WHAT DO WE DO BILLY? WE WORK TOGETHER AS ONE. AND WE CARRY OUT WHAT I THINK WAS FELEAKA'S PLAN. NORTH OF HERE ARE CAVES LEADING TO COBRA'S LAIR, WE GO IN AT NIGHT AND WE TAKE BACK THE MEDALLION. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] TOMORROW WE DESTROY THAT WHICH IS WEAK AND WORTHLESS. CHEERS! TONIGHT... WE FEAST. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] HUKO, ANUI GO BACK AND GET THOSE VINES FROM THE WALL THERE, REMEMBER? [DRAMATIC MUSIC] GUARDS! GO, GO! I'LL MEET YOU WHERE WE CAME IN. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] WHO ARE YOU TO CHALLENGE ME? YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A WORM, HMM? [POW!] WHERE IS HE? IN THE CELL. YOU MUST MAKE HIM YOUR FRIEND. HE'S MY ENEMY. BUT AS A FRIEND, HE WILL GIVE YOU HIS HEART. AS YOUR NEW ADVISOR, I TELL YOU, WITH HIS HEART, YOU WILL GAIN THE WORLD. [SNAKE HISSES] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] DEADLY. DID YOU SLEEP WELL, MY FRIEND? I'M NOT YOUR FRIEND. BUT YOUR ARE IN NEED OF FRIENDS. I ALREADY HAVE FRIENDS. NO. YOU HAD FRIENDS. THEY SET OFF A TRAP LAST NIGHT. THEY WERE KILLED. I'M SO SORRY. [MUSIC] (YOUNG GIRL) WERE HIS FRIENDS REALLY DEAD? (YOUNG GIRL) NO! THEY CAN'T BE DEAD! BILLY NEEDS THEM! (DANIEL - STORYTELLER) IT DID LOOK HOPELESS FOR BILLY. HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. BUT THE STORY ISN'T OVER YET. LATER THAT NIGHT, COBRA BROUGHT BILLY TO HIS DINING HALL, WHERE HE HAD A GREAT FEAST PREPARED. AND BILLY WOULD SOON LEARN WHAT COBRA WAS REALLY AFTER. WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? I WANT YOU TO HELP ME MAKE THE MEDALLION WORK. YOU NEED MY HEART. YES. SO TOGETHER WE CAN SHARE IN ITS POWER. AND YOU WILL BE- SPECIAL. FALEAKA! BILLY. I DIDN'T GET THE MEDALLION. IT WAS NEVER ABOUT THE MEDALLION. IT WAS ALWAYS ABOUT THIS. [HEARS RATTLING SOUNDS] WILL YOU HELP ME, MY FRIEND? NO! THEN YOUR DEATH WILL PRECEDE THE MEDALLIONS DESTRUCTION. OH, BY THE WAY, YOUR FRIENDS ARE NOT REALLY DEAD BUT THEY WILL BE SOON. AS WILL YOU. (YOUNG BOY) 1 KNEW THEY WEREN'T DEAD. 1 KNEW IT THE WHOLE TIME. (DANIEL - STORYTELLER) THEY WEREN'T DEAD, BUT THEY WERE IN TROUBLE. FOR DEEP BELOW COBRA'S FORTRESS, THEY WERE FORCED TO WORK IN THE HOT DUNGEON, WHERE THE GUARDS WOULD WHIP ANYONE THEY CHOSE. [MUSIC] ALLIE! YOU'RE OK. AND SO ARE YOU. ANUI SAVED US AGAIN. GET DOWN! [SCREAMS] ALLIE, IT'S ALL ABOUT OUR HEARTS! THAT'S THE ANSWER TO THE RIDDLE. OUR HEARTS "WHERE WORTH AND PURPOSE BOTH RESIDE." BUT HOW CAN WE FIGHT COBRA WITH OUR HEARTS? EACH OF US HAS OUR OWN PURPOSE. THINK PINEAPPLE. HERE'S WHAT I THINK FALEAKA HAD IN MIND. YOU KNOW HOW YOU MADE YOUR PINEAPPLE EXPLODE? WE'LL TEACH THE OTHER WOMEN HOW TO DO THE SAME. AND THEN HAVE ANUI MAKE A POTION THAT CAUSES ALL OF COBRA'S GUARDS TO FALL ASLEEP. AFTER THAT, HAVE HUKO SERVE THEM. COBRA WANTS YOU. COBRA!, COBRA!, COBRA!, COBRA!, COBRA!, COBRA! TONIGHT, WE DESTROY OUR ENEMIES! [CHEERS] [MUSIC] NO! [CHEERS] [MUSIC] GO, GO, GO, GO, GO! STOP! GET HIM! [MUSIC] [SCREAMS] SOMEBODY HELP! GET OUT OF MY WAY. [MUSIC] [SCREAMING] COME WITH ME! [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [RUMBLING NOISES] DO YOU THINK YOU CAN TAKE THE MEDALLION FROM ME? I DON'T NEED THE MEDALLION. WELL, IF YOU DON'T NEED IT, I'LL TAKE THAT STONE OFF YOUR HANDS IN EXCHANGE FOR THE GIRL. DON'T DO IT BILLY, YOU NEED TO STOP ALL THIS! ALL RIGHT, FINE! I'LL GIVE YOU THE STONE, BUT FIRST, YOU GIVE ME ALLIE. FIRST THE STONE. [MUSIC] THE REAL STONE. COME AND GET IT. [MUSIC AND FIGHTING SOUNDS] AH! [MUSIC] BILLY! BILLY! LET GO OF THE MEDALLION. I WON'T LET IT GO! PLEASE, PLEASE JUST LET GO. YOU'RE SLIPPING. [MUSIC] NO! AAAAAH! ALLIE! ALLIE! HE WASN'T KIND. (DANIEL-STORYTELLER) BILLY AND HIS FRIENDS HAD FOUGHT VALIANTLY ALONG SIDE THE VILLAGERS, AND BECAUSE OF THEIR COURAGE, COBRA WAS DEFEATED. THE NEXT NIGHT, THE VILLAGERS THREW A BIG CELEBRATION, WITH MORE FOOD THAN BILLY HAD EVER SEEN. [MUSIC] YOU KNOW WE'RE HERE FOR GOOD RIGHT? I'VE GOT AN IDEA. WE DIDN'T FIND THIS FOR ANOTHER 200 YEARS. HOW DID YOU KNOW IT'D BE HERE? FALEAKA'S WALKING STICK. I MEAN I BROUGHT HIS BACK AND HE STILL HAD HIS. YOU KEEP IT. IT'S WHAT YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN LOOKING FOR. I'VE ALWAYS HAD WHAT I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR. IT WAS JUST... BURIED INSIDE OF ME. I'LL LEAVE THE MEDALLION HERE FOR YOU. THANK YOU. FOR SAVING OUR ISLAND. [MUSIC] OK, LET'S GO SAVE MY DAD. [MUSIC] READY? [MUSIC] I WISH THEM BACK TO WHERE THEY BELONG. [AH, OOOH UH...] BILLY! PLEASE TELL ME THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO SHOW ME WITH THAT STICK! I THOUGHT THEY WERE PART OF COBRA'S GANG. WHO'S? WHAT GANG? YOUNG MAN. I ASSURE YOU 'TIS NOT OPEN SEASON ON ARCHEOLOGISTS. I AM SO SORRY. I THINK WE MIGHT HAVE CHANGED A FEW THINGS BILLY. DAD, I THINK I KNOW WHERE YOU CAN FIND THE MEDALLION. [MUSIC] KING HUGO'S EMBLEM. [MUSIC] (DANIEL - STORYTELLER) BILLY'S DAD WAS GRATEFUL TO HAVE FOUND THE MEDALLION, BUT REALIZED THAT THE GREATER TREASURE WAS HAVING BILLY AS A SON. AS FOR THE KIDS; PRINCE HUKO DISCOVERED THAT GREATNESS COMES WHEN YOU LOVE AND SERVE OTHERS. AND HE HELPED HIS PEOPLE BY PUTTING THEM ABOVE HIMSELF. AND ALLIE, SHE LEARNED THAT NO ONE IS AN ACCIDENT TO GOD, AND THAT HE HAS AN INCREDIBLE PURPOSE FOR EVERYONE, EVEN BRAVE LITTLE GIRLS. AND BILLY. BILLY LEARNED THAT HIS GREATEST VALUE CAME FROM GOD. AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING HE COULD EVER DO, WAS TO TRUST HIS HEART TO THE ONE WHO CREATED IT. MY HEART IS MY MEDALLION. YOU ARE A VERY SMART BOY. DON'T EVER FORGET THAT GOD LOVES YOU, MORE THAN YOU COULD EVER KNOW. THANK YOU, DANIEL. THAT WAS QUITE A STORY. WHERE DID YOU GET IT? BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I JUST MADE IT UP AS I WENT ALONG. WELL IT WAS PERFECT. I JUST HATE THAT YOU MISSED YOUR GAME, THOUGH. I DON'T. THIS DID MORE FOR ME THAN ANY GAME EVER COULD. DON'T EVER GIVE UP ON THEM. I NEVER GAVE UP ON YOU, DID I DANNY, WHEN YOU WERE HERE? NO, YOU DIDN'T. DON'T STAY AWAY SO LONG OKAY? IF MS. JESSIE EVER CAN'T MAKE IT TUESDAY, CALL ME. OK. THANK YOU FOR LOVING ME ALL THOSE YEARS. ISN'T THAT WHY WE'RE HERE?
