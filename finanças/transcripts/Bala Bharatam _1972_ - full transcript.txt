The great king. . . .the victorious Panduraja. . . . is entering the courtyard. . . .after defeating the enemies. Salutations, brother. - May God bless you ! I am happy to receive you after your victory in the battlefield. . . . but I can't accept your salutations. What's my offence? - When the head of the dynasty. . . . Bheeshma is here, how can you salute me. . . . before saluting him? - He hasn't done anything wrong. Do not doubt Panduraju's propriety. Dhrutarastra, you are the king of this kingdom. And we are all your servants. You deserve the first salutations. Though I am the king, you are the head of this kingdom. . . .and brother uses his talent. I am just a fortunate person to be in your company. Brother, you are undermining your strength. Your physical strength is matchless. Your intelligence is as high as the mountains. If you had eyes the rival kings wouldn't have dared. . . .to come in front of you. God did injustice to you. You are right. Your words are true, brother. Brother Vidhura, how are you? I hope your worshipping and ceremonies for the deity. . . .are going on without any obstacles. Gods are pleased with Vidhura's devotion. . . .and a blessing for the world. - Blessing? Who knows how happy Gods are with Vidhura's devotion ! Brother-in-law Shakuni is right here? I didn't see you This person is not that important. The brother-in-law of the king gets more respect. . . .than the king. Enough. This is the courtyard. You can't laugh here. Panduraja, your wives' are eagerly waiting for you. . . . in the palace. Welcome to the palace. Accept my salutations. We welcome the victorious king. Wives' reception is vital for me. But it's our tradition to gift the wives'. . . .who wait for the kings in the palace. Here they are. I am presenting these ornaments. . . .to the queens of this kingdom. Kunti, you accept that box. It's not me. There's another person. . . .who should get the first gift. Am I right, sister? - Yes. Queen Gandhari is reverend for us. You must present the first gift to her. - Alright. You must present the first gift to her. - Alright. . . is quite important in a family. Present these ornaments along with my salutations. . . .to sister-in-law. I can't see anything. Why are you giving this blind woman. . . .those ornaments? - It's for our happiness, sister. Flower emits fragrance not for itself, but for others. A flower and you both provide us with happiness. Sister, shall we adorn the elder sister with these ornaments. . . .and serve her? - You shouldn't serve me, sisters. . . . but you should serve your husband who returned. . . .after a long battle. Brother-in-law might be eagerly waiting for you. . . .as he has been away from you for a long time. Am I right? You must go to him immediately. Sister, your wish is our command. We shall go now. Satyasena. Satyasena. - Yes, sister-in-law. Have you seen her! Have you seen Kunti's magnanimity! It's our good fortune to have her in this family. No! It's our misfortune. From distance even the mountains appear smooth. But sister, the filth in the heart is not visible to eyes. Brother, why do you have so much ill-will for others! Those who cannot see others happy. . . .are digging their own graves. I know that. But still I have been telling you since. . . .a long time that you shouldn't show your generosity. . . .where it is not needed. Sister, danger is approaching your husband and you. Panduraju is conspiring against your husband. Bheeshma has made the younger brother. . . .the king of this kingdom even when the elder brother is alive. Brother, stop throwing muck on their righteousness. Great. You have tied blindfold on your eyes. . . .as your husband is blind. Now you want to shut your ears as well, sister? Hear and see everything. Then you will understand the real nature of Bheeshma. Enough ! How can you make such baseless accusations on him! He's a man of integrity. And Panduraju is a great human being. And Kunti reveres me. Himadri is an epitome of a human being. Those who point fingers at them. . . .will be given death-penalty? It's only for your welfare that I left my kingdom. . . .and came here with my wife. All I think about is your welfare. All I want is your happiness. I can do anything for that. I won't stop even if you stop me. Aghori, what is your canon ball saying? Abracadabra. See this. He is entering the forest to fight the monster. If he enters the forest there's a threat to his life. Panduraja, for your crime of being my enemy. . . .you will be destroyed by me. Do you have to ring the bell to present gifts? What's the problem that you are facing ! Ours lives are in danger, lord. There's a major threat to our lives. We are unable to live peacefully in the forest, lord. The wild animals are entering our provinces. . . .and preying on our children. Please hunt that beast and save our lives, lord. Brother, if you permit me I will go to the forest today itself. . . .and rescue these people. - You need not go, brother. Yes, you returned from the battlefield yesterday. You need not leave again today. Don't leave your queens for a few days. Forgive me, lord. We shouldn't get the scar. . . .on the reputation of this kingdom that when the lives. . . .of your people are in trouble the royal family. . . . is enjoying the company of their queens. I think Panduraju should go to the forest. . . .and rescue these people. Now it's up to you to take the decision. What brother-in-law Shakuni said is right. I don't want to hamper the reputation of this kingdom. Give me your permission to go to the forest. We cannot do anything that hampers the reputation. . . .of this kingdom. You may go to the forest. You may go. You may go. - Bless me, lord. ''You naughty beloved, you mischievous beloved. '' ''Stop your mischief. '' ''I will reveal all your secrets. I will tell everything about you. '' ''I will reveal all your secrets. I will tell everything about you. '' ''You naughty beloved, you mischievous beloved. '' ''Stop your mischief. '' ''I will reveal all your secrets. I will tell everything about you. '' ''I will reveal all your secrets. I will tell everything about you. '' ''You married me in presence of fire-god. '' ''Now you brought the other woman home. '' ''Even Gods have two wives. '' ''Even Gods have two wives. '' ''What's wrong if your husband has two wives, O sister?'' ''O my beloved one. O my dear one. '' ''Why are you screaming at me, O girl?'' ''Maharaja can hear you. He can punish me. '' ''Maharaja can hear you. He can punish me. '' ''You cast an evil eye on him. '' ''Your trapped this kid. '' ''Your trapped this kid. '' ''I didn't call him to me. '' ''You are a shameless girl. '' ''Get out of our lives. '' ''O my beloved one. O my dear one. '' ''Why are you screaming at me, O girl?'' ''Maharaja can hear you. He can punish me. '' ''Maharaja can hear you. He can punish me. '' ''Follow me if you love me. '' ''If you love me, come to me. '' ''Come to me. - Come to me. '' ''Come to me. - Come to me. '' ''Why can't you live like queen Kunti and queen Himadri?'' ''Why can't you live like queen Kunti and queen Himadri?'' ''Learn something from them. Live in peace like them. '' ''O my beloved one. O my dear one. '' ''Why do you fight all the times?'' ''Let's sing and dance and salute the king and queens. '' ''Let's sing and dance and salute the king and queens. '' ''Let's sing and dance and salute the king and queens. '' ''Let's sing and dance and salute the king and queens. '' ''Let's sing and dance and salute the king and queens. '' Performer. Hey, come here. Take it. You gave me your chain for my performance? May God give you 100 years! Great. Doing charity comes naturally to everyone. . . . in this kingdom. Who is that kid? He's our son, lord. Son, may you prosper in life. Take this. Great. So you only donate, but don' t accept anything. - Yes. Athiratha, what's the name of this child? We named him Vashusaina. But everyone calls him Karna. Why so? - May be because he was born with the armor. How do you know that, queen? It's clearly visible, lord. He got this armor with birth. . . . but it's not an artificial one. The motherhood inside me is making me hug this child. Come to me, son. Won't you come to me? Go to her, son. I am like your mother. Come to me, son. You are not my mother. She's my mother. You are right. She's the one got this boon. Son, not just those who gave birth to you, but even those. . . .who see you once in their lifetime are fortunate ones. Son, give me a chance to take you into my arms. . . .for a moment and pamper you. Son, come to me once. My son starts crying when he is with strangers. Please forgive me, queen. Athiratha, you may go now. Someone rightly said that we shouldn't let. . . .childless women hold our children. She has cast an evil eye on my child. Radha. - I cast off the evil eye from him. She's an evil woman. She's an evil woman. She can be the queen of this kingdom. . . . but she can't take away my child from me. Radha, that's wrong. - Yes. It's wrong. Separating a mother from her child is wrong. How would she understand my pain ! You too won't understand how much a mother. . . .suffers when the child is crying. Radha, you can't forget the truth because of your love. We don't know who gave birth to this child. We got him at the banks of a river. Lord, I touch your feet and beg you. . . . please do not talk about that incident ever again. My Karna is my life. No matter whoever has given birth to him. . . .I won't let her come close to him. ''The saint was pleased by her service and. . '' ''. .gave her a boon that she would have children any time she wishes. '' ''She wanted to see. . '' ''. . if that saint meant his words. '' ''She prayered the lord. . '' ''. .and lord prestended her with a child. '' ''She couldn't enjoy the bliss of motherhood. . '' ''. .and was scared of the harsh world. '' ''With the fear of world. . '' ''. .she left her son in the Ganges. '' ''She left her son. . '' ''. .and wept for him every living moment. '' Dear, wise people ignore what fools say. You shouldn't be upset that someone else's child. . . .didn't come to you. I am not upset about that. I am upset that God didn't give me a child like him. Do not worry, queen. You will have a child after we leave the forest. We will have a big family. With God's wishes our house will be filled with babies. Come, dear. Dear, due to my worries I forgot to tell you this. You are about to go to hunting early in the morning. Go and take rest. Lord. - You arrogant king, you preyed on innocent people. With your arrogance you predated. . . .on two saints who renounced from the world. I curse you that you will die. . . .the moment you make love with your life. No. Can't I get rid of this curse, saint? Will my race end with me? - No. Years ago a hunter separated a pair of birds. Valmiki saw that and cursed that hunter. . . .and then Ramayana was born from his grief. Your merciless act can write history. Do not worry. I will die only if I come close to you. If I take renouncement from the worldly pleasures. . . .you won't become widows. Death can't come close to me if I become a saint. Atiratha. You take my armory back to the capital. Inform the elders that I have taken renouncement. . . .along with my wives. How unfortunate! What have we done wrong ! Why has God given this punishment to Panduraja. . . .at this age! He should've been ruling this kingdom. . . . but now he is leading his life in the jungle. - Oh lord ! Why has God done this to Kunti's life? Why has God done this to Himadri? Why did they get such harsh punishment? Sister, you shouldn't get upset when you should celebrate. You should be happy that Kunti and Himadri. . . .will be childless all their lives. My wish will come true when you will give birth to a son. All my efforts will bear fruits then. You got lord Shiva's boon at a young age. Offer prayers to lord and ask him a boon. . . .to give you 100 children, sister. Kulekrusha, what's the rush? Where are you going? You are a saint. First you stopped me. . . .and then you are asking me where I am going. Don't you know that Gandhari is about to be pregnant? I know that. And I also know that you are about to be born. . . .from her womb as her eldest son. Then why are you asking me even after knowing that? Mother earth will have to earn a huge burden now. Hail lord Narayana ! Hail lord Narayana ! ''O lord on the seven-headed serpent. '' ''O incomprehensible being ! '' ''O destroyer of the demons. '' ''It's time you get up and destroy the demons. . '' ''. .and save your beautiful world. '' ''Get up from your sleep! '' Narada, what's the reason for your turbulence? It's natural. If the demon takes birth on earth. . . . before the birth of your incarnation. . . .then what will happen to earth ! Did he leave to take birth from Gandhari's womb? She's a faithful wife. He can't enter inside her so easily. He will enter into her womb sooner or later. If you don't take an incarnation mother earth. . . .can't take his burden. In Dwapara age those who were about to be born. . Many of them have taken birth. The demons, the destroyers, everyone. . The demons have taken birth and their destroyers. . . . have also reached the earth. Mother earth is waiting for your arrival. Innocent Naradha, you are omniscient. You have already seen who is killing whom. What's the use if I take birth on earth before Pandavas? Narayana ! Narayana ! How will Panduraju have children ! He is cursed, isn't he? His wife Kunti has a boon. Remind it to them and do a favor on world. Definitely. ''Lord Narayana, your deeds are incomprehensible. '' ''With your blessings Bharatam has taken birth. '' ''Bharatam has taken birth. '' ''Lord Narayana, your deeds are incomprehensible. '' ''With your blessings Bharatam has taken birth. '' ''Bharatam has taken birth.

'' Krishna, you performed magical tricks in Repalli. . . .and deceived the people. . . .of your province till now. Uncle, you sent Putana to kill me. . . .and I killed her in return. It showed my courage. Stealing things from people's houses. . . . is not mischief, but it's crime. Sending your soldiers to kill. . . .the innocent saints is not called bravery. Looking after cattle is not courage. Who is the culprit who is tormenting his sister? Krishna, you won't be alive for too long. Kansa, your atrocities will be put to an end now. Uncle. Uncle Kamsa. I'm here. Here. No, here. I'm here. No, I'm above your head. Salutations to master Tandipalli. - God bless you ! Balarama. Krishna. Follow your master. . . .and learn all the arts. - As you say, father. Master, our mobile pupilage is ready to leave. Kuchela, you have been dreaming of meeting. . . . Sri Krishna since a long time. Krishna. - Kuchela. Krishna, I am so fortunate to see you. I am blessed. Kuchela. Vasudeva, can we go now? - Father, bless us. Mother, can we go now? Let us go, son. Queen. Queen. - Lord. Queen, come into my arms. You are cursed, lord. - Queen. You are cursed, lord. - Queen. Queen. Queen. - Lord. Queen. Queen. Queen ! Lord ! Sister. - Sister. Sister, it's not my fault. I reminded him of the curse. I tried my best to stop him. I tried my best to save our husband's life, but. . But. . Lord. Lord. O lord ! Why did you leave us alone? Who will look after our children, lord? Will they become fatherless so early in their lives! O lord ! Lord, it's a wife's dharma to foll ow her husband to heaven. Sister, call the priest. Make the arrangements for my departure with my husband. Sister, it's not you, but I'm the one who should go with him. I am of reason behind of his death. I can't stay alive, lord. I don't have the strength to bring up our kids. You are the elder one. You have to take that responsibility. Sister, if not for me, you will at least have to live for our kids. I am begging you. Please give me your blessings. Sister. Mother. Mother. Mother. Mother. Sister Dushala ! Whom are you getting ready to worship? You are about to worship this prince? Prince? You don't even have a moustache. . . .and you want the kingdom. You didn't even get the prince's throne. . . .and you want me to worship you? It's an insult to me. Uncle Shakuni. - Nephew. You said that you would make me the king. . . . no matter whoever becomes the hurdle in my path. . . .and today this enemy of mine is making fun of me. And you are silent about it? What you said is reasonable, but it's not advisable. . . .to rush into things. If we rush into things now we will have to pay for it later. You will never succeed in your plans. Arrogant girl, you dared to insult our uncle? I will punish you with this mace. Satyasena. Satyasena. Take me to the reception chamber right now. - Sister. So that you could give reception to Kunti? Yes, brother. - Sister, it's wrong on your part. Your son is about to be enthroned as the prince. . . .and you are going to receive Kunti. . . .and her sons who had a doubtful birth. As soon as those tribal people step into this kingdom. . . .your son will lose his throne and you will be left with. . . .endless sorrows. - Brother. Brother. Is that what would happen? I won't let it happen. I won't even let a fly harm my nephew. It's true. It's true. - Your words are so comforting. Satyasena. Satyasena. We are not going to the courtyard. Sister, that's not right. In politics the left hand. . . .shouldn't know what the right hand does. You must shower her with love from outside. . . . but conspire against her from inside. Go. Sister. Kunti. - Sister. Kunti. Come, sister. Salutations to the king. Son, when the head of this family Bheeshma is there. . . .why did you salute me first? - Lord, you are the king. . . .and we are servants. You must receive. . . .the first salutations. A flower starts spreading fragrance as soon as it's born. He got all the great qualities of his father Panduraja. God bless you. Dhrutarastra, have you seen. . . .Yudhistar's manners! Suyodhana, you must learn. . . .such good manners from your brother. I need not learn anything from others. Suyodhana, if you don't know the way to talk in courtyard. . . .you should better keep quiet. The prince knows the etiquette of the court. So you already became the king? Dharmaraja was born before you. He's elder than you. He's the elder of this dynasty. He will be the successor of this kingdom. He will become the future king. - I won't accept it. Even if you don't accept it that is what will happen. It's wrong. The one who returned from the forest. . . .will get the throne and the one who was born. . . . in the capital will be dethroned? I can't tolerate it. It doesn't matter if you can tolerate it or not. . . . but as per dharma Dharmaraja will be seated. . . .on prince's throne. - What! He will become the future king? We don't know when he was born, where he was born. . . .and to whom he was born, and you call him. . . .the eldest of the kids? - Shakuni ! You can shut my mouth, but you can't shut the mouth. . . .of this world. Before the birth of these children. . . .I heard that Panduraju was cursed. . . .that he would die if goes close to his wives. Then how were they born? Who will believe it if you say he is the father of these children? Who will accept it if that child gets this kingdom! An illegitimate child can't become the future king? The eldest of the Kauravas deserves to get that throne. Suyodhana will be the future king of this kingdom. What's this quake? What does this inauspicious sign means? This is not new for us. The moment your eldest son. . . . Suyodhana was born, there vultures celebrated. And today when you are thinking of making him the king. . . .foxes are howling and the earth is quaking. If you observe these inauspicious signs. . . . it seems that your son will be the destroy of this dynasty. Yes. If you denounce him immediately. . . . it will save this family from destruction. We need not punish anyone. Let there me atonements and religious vows. . . .to get rid of this auspicious signs. It would be appropriate if my sons. . . .and Panduraja's sons live together. That's what is good for this family. Didn't you hear what happened in the courtyard. . . .today? They are saying that my son is the destroyer. . . .of this family, and that when he was born. . . .vultures were celebrating, and that today. . . .the foxes were howling. That this kingdom. . . .will be in safe hands if it's given to your son. Then why do they need us here? I will hand you over the comforts of kingdom. . . .and I will go to live forest with my sons. - Sister. Had I known that we would be hurting you so much. . . .we wouldn't have returned to Hastinapur. The women of the royal family can't go to live in the forest. . . .due to the issues in the royal court. Sister, I swear that as long as I am alive. . . .you will the king's mother. Sister, your blessings are very important for my sons and me. Sister, I know your nature. I can give you my blessings only if you assure me. . . .that you will keep your sons in your control. . . .and that the differences between the cousin. . . .won't lead to drastic consequences. Sister, I want you to live happily for hundred years. I too want Kauravas and Pandavas. . . .to live harmoniously. Suyodhana, dare to stop me. It's against the rules. It's against the rules. Shutting the nose is against the rules. You will get the punishment for doing this mistake. You can't play for some time. - Who are you to punish me! Questioning the umpire is another mistake. Get out of the line of play immediately. I won't move. - But still you will have to go. How arrogant! The hand that is raised on my brother. . . .will have to break into pieces. Oh God ! Brother-in-law. Brother-in-law. I am your uncle Shakuni's son. Leave me. Mother. Mother. Mother. Mother. Mother. - What happened? How did this happen? He broke my leg. That evil Bheema twisted my head and immersed me. . . . in the water. . And. . Oh God ! Bheema bashed all of us, brother. You must have done something. That's why he bashed you up. - Sister. You shouldn't take the enemy's side. Mother, we haven't done anything wrong. I warned to behave themselves. . . . in front of the future king of this kingdom. That's all. And he bashed you up for such a simple matter? Oh God ! Oh God ! That Bheema wanted to kill my sons. This can't his idea. It's Kunti who must've instigated him. Satyasena, come. We will decide it right now. . . . if Kunti or I will stay in Hastinapur. Mother, I taught them a lesson. Now those hundred brothers won't trouble us. It's wrong, son. They gave us a shelter to live here. Do not forget that we are orphans. Promise me that you won't repeat such a thing again. Mother. - Promise me, son. Alright, mother. You are asking me to control my anger? I cannot bear it anymore. I will have to get that Bheema thrown out of this province. Just out of the province? You think small. Sister, throwing him out. . . .of this province won't solve the problem. Is that possible! Do you have some other solution. . . .to get rid of that demon? - Yes, there is. There is even a single for the snake-bite. Sister. if you do as I say we will get rid of the problem. . . .called Bheema. - Tell me. Tell me what I will have to do. Brother Akrura, I didn't know that kids' mischief. . . .will create differences among the elders. I try my best to keep my children in control. . . . but there is some fight or other with their cousins. Because of their differences with their cousins. . . .I fear how the future will turn out to be. This is something that is deeply troubling me. God is there for those who don't have anyone. Sri Krishna is the lord visible to everyone. His grace is eternal. In Repalli, in Mathura, you will find this statue in every house. This is the statue everyone's worshipping. Be his devotee and worship him. Sister Kunti. - Sister. You came here? I would have come to your chamber. . . . had you called me there. - Those who apologize. . . .should go to those whom they beg for forgiveness. Your sons and you must forgive us. What are you saying, sister! You are elder than me. How can you apologize to us! Because mother gets the punishment. . . .for the kids' mistakes. Suyodhana misbehaved on the playground. I told him that he should apologize. He listened to me and came here to apologize. Son. Suoyodhana. Brother, forgive me. Bheema, you will forgive me, won't you? Suyodhana, I forgot what happened a long time ago. Let bygones be bygones. I hope that the affection towards each other. . . .stays there forever. - I too want the same. Sister, my children want to go to the forest and also eat there. Will you send your children as well? - Sure. Dharmaja, go there with your brothers. - Ok, mother. ''There will be a feast. There will be celebrations. '' ''We will have lunch in the forest. '' ''There will be a feast. There will be celebrations. '' ''We will have lunch in the forest. '' ''There are garelu.

I can eat as much as you hundred brothers would eat. Is that so! - You bet. - I bet you. Dushyasana, divide the food in two parts. Bheema will eat one part and the rest of us. . . .will eat the other part. - Alright. Come, Dushyasana. Bheema, this is yours and this is ours. I will see how much you can eat. - O yes, you can see. Ok, then, come. Suyodhana, this is poison. None of us should eat these dishes. Now get going. It's so tasty. This is how dishes should be prepared. You are praising it so much. Is it that tasty! - Yes. Taste it. No, brother. - Brother, he's a greedy fellow. Let him have some. Brother Bheema is not giving him. . . . poison, is he? Brother Bheema, give him some. Take it. - Bheema, did you forget the bet? You said that you would eat as much as we would eat. Yes, I won't give you even a single grain. The lunch is over. - Hail lord Shankar. Hail lord Mahadev! - Hail lord Mahadev! Suyodhana, I heard that these days. . . .a festival going on in Repalli and Mathura. What's that? - Everyone is hailing Krishna's name. Alright. We shall also follow them. Brother, we shall also do it. Govinda ! Govinda ! - Govinda ! Govinda ! What happened? Brother Bheema. . Brother Bheema. . Brother Bheema. . Brother Bheema what? - He is. . He is. . He is in deep slumber. He's still alive? Uncle, did you mix poison or something else? - Poison? Shut your mouth. Suyodhana, nothing has gone out of limits. This is the right opportunity.

I can drink as many glasses you can provide. You already drank seven pots of juice. You are trying to drink one more? Bheema, till now no one couldn't drink. . . .one complete pot. You drank eight pots. If you drink more than that you might faint. That's enough, son. My head is spinning. Everything looks so strange. Mother. Aunt, I brought milk. You will have to drink some at least for me. No, dear. No. I don't want anything till get my Bheema back. Snake. Snake. Snake. Snake. Snake. Snake. Arjun, do not harm it, son. Mother Kunti, your son is safe in the Nagalok( snake-world). My son is alive? My son is safe. Yes. Do not worry at all. Your so n will be back in a while. Dharmaja ! Arjuna ! Bheema is alive. Nakula. Sahadeva. Your brother Bheema is fine. Dushala, your brother will be back soon. Krishna, you answer my prayers. You rescued me, Krishna. Grandfather. - Bheema. Grandfather, you are all so small? Yes, son. Everyone is small in front of you. You drank eight pots of snake-nectar and gained. . . .the strength of 8,000 elephants and that size. Great. Bheema, if you look so big at this age. . . .evil eyes will fall on you and it will be harmful to you. Grandfather, what's the solution now? Do not worry. I am giving you the boon that you can. . Bheema, come back to your normal size. Hail Kaka Aryaka ! Hail Kaka Aryaka ! Hail Kaka Aryaka ! Grandfather, mother will be very happy. . . .when she will see the divine powers I got. - Yes, son. If you permit me I shall go home now. Alright, son. Your mother is worried about you. You shall go now. Mother, Bheema is here. Bheema is here? Bheema is here? Mother. - Bheema - Mother. Bheema - Mother. You are back, son? You are back. Son, I was so worried when you went missing. You scared me, son. You really scared me. Do not cry, mother. Do not cry. Mother, look how many diamonds I brought. I will worship your feet with these, mother. Son. Bheema. Mother, I drank snake-nectar in Nagalok( snake-world). . . .and got huge strength, mother. With this power I will destroy all my enemies, mother. Son, do not rush into anything. No, mother. We shouldn't forgive them. That day they mixed poison in my food during the feast in the forest. . . .and tied me with ropes and threw me in the lake. Who told you so, son ! And also, who would believe these words? Your great grandfather king Aryaka. . . .told me in the Nagalok. King Aryaka? - Yes, mother. He said that. . Don't tell anyone about it, son. - Mother! Yes. You must behave as if nothing happened. What are you saying, mother! You want me to hide the truth? You shouldn't. No one can hide the truth. No one can. Kunti, you are a woman of great integrity. But if we don't curb the sins there can be. . . .disastrous consequences. If we can't mould a plant. . . .then we can never mould it when it becomes a tree. The culprits must be found and punished. Vidhura, call for a royal meeting tomorrow morning. Dhrutarastra, you have to take come harsh decisions. . . . in the courtyard today. First of all decide that you will take some tough decisions. . . .and we hear what happened. - As you say. Everything is quite surprising to me. I can't believe that my son Suyodhana. . . .can do such a thing. I can't believe it. I can't believe it. Dhrutarastra, emotional attachments in courtyard. . . . lead to drastic consequences. It's your dharma to forgot your blood ties. . . .and punish the culprit. This can't just be the deed of the kids. . . . but there might be some elders' evil intentions behind it. That's why the culprits must get the punishment. I am unable to understand it. You pass the verdict. Alright. Suyodhana, what did you during the feast in the forest? Why aren't you saying anything ! Don't you have words to explain your evil deeds? It's injustice. Even before passing the verdict. . . .you cannot call his deeds evil deeds. Suyodhana, do not be scared. Tell him as it is. So you already told him what to say. Dhrutarastra, Shakuni will spoil your son. Be careful. Why is this gathering called ! To talk about what happened or to predict what will happen? Both are important, Shakuni. Suyodhana, tell us what you did that day. I tried to do a good deed and I am accused of this crime. I don't know anything. - You don't know anything? First you commit crimes and then you lie in the court? Tell me the truth. - Lord. Lord. Lord, will you punish my son with the sword? Have mercy on me and don't destroy my legacy. Dhrutarastra, it's because of you and to save your legacy. . . .I took the oath to stay unmarried all my life. . . .and not to have children, so that you can sit on this throne. . . .and be the king of Hastinapur. It's only to save your legacy that I am staying here. . . . in this kingdom and looking after the daily affairs. . . .of this kingdom. It's only for you that I got your father remarried. . . .with king Kashi's daughter. I made you the king of this kingdom. . . .only to save your legacy, but not to ruin it. Dhrutarastra, as much as I protect you. . . .I will punish your sinful, immoral sons. If he accepts his evil deed I will forgive Suyodhana. Suyodhana, he never goes back on his word. Touch his feet and tell him the truth. Save your life and my life, son. Save our lives. Tell me the truth. - Alright, it was a mistake. Mistake? Is searching for poison purposely a mistake? Is mixing it in Bheema's food a mistake? Or tying him and throwing him in a lake. . . .to hide your evil deed a sin? What's a mistake? Tell me. How unfortunate! I can't see this. I can't see this. Suyodhana, do not have any doubts. Tell him the truth. Yes, I searched for poison to kill Bheema. I mixed in his food. - Did you get this idea. . . .or did someone asked you to do this? No one told me to do this. I conspired against Bheema as he is stronger than me. It's my mistake. Forgive me. Don't touch my feet. Touch Bheema's feet. Bheema, forgive my mistake. - Suyodhana, elders forgive us. But it's not me. Because of you I was able to drink snake-nectar. . . .and gained immense strength. For that I thank you. Suyodhana, Dharmaja is the eldest of you all. . . .and he's the one who has the rights to forgive you. Give him a hug and say you will live harmoniously. . . .and play together and never fight again. Brother. - Suyodhana, you need not say anything. From today onwards we are 105 brothers. 'Offense. Offense. It's an insult. ' 'Instead of leading such life it would be far better to die. ' 'It would be far better to die. ' Suyodhana. Suyodhana. - Leave me. Leave me. Suyodhana, it's the way of the wise to kill oneself. . . .every time there is a trouble. You need not die till I am there with you. I felt really proud of you when you hid the truth. . . . in faced the insult in the courtroom. I am proud of you. If possible I will make you the emperor of this kingdom. Pandavas might have respect in this kingdom. . . . but we have the power of these numbers. See this. Suyodhana, ask me for a number. Do not doubt. You can see what the result will be. Six. Three. Have you seen this! These dices will get you the throne. My dices will come to your rescue. Gandhara-kumara ! I know why you came to Hastinapur. . . .and why you settled at this place forever. In the past when all your men were dead. . . .you took rescue in the homes of the poor. Shakuni, I can see the evil behind those eyes. Even if this kid hides the truth about your involvement. . . . in Bheema's poisoning, this old man knows it. I didn't want to kill you in the courtroom. . . .and hurt your sister and brother-in-law. Your intelligence is higher than the sky. Couldn't you understand such a simple matter? You want me to believe it? Shakuni, keep on thing in mind that I can't bear it. . . . if you try to destroy the kingdom I have built. . . . right in front of my eyes. Suyodhana, you must befriend kids of your age. Go. Go and play with your brothers. Enjoy the songs and dance of your sister. Go. Go! ''O Krishna ! O Krishna ! You are our lord. '' ''You are the supreme lord. You are the dharma. '' ''O Krishna ! O Krishna ! You are our lord. '' ''You are the supreme lord. You are the dharma. '' ''Gods and demons. . '' ''. .searched for the ocean of milk. '' ''Gods and demons searched for the ocean of milk. '' ''Then nectar was born and everyone got greedy. '' ''What did you do then?'' ''He took the form of a lady and that grace and that aura. . '' ''. .and smiled mischievously. '' ''What else have you done?'' ''You distributed the nectar among the deserving ones. '' ''And you gave a big zero to the arrogant ones. '' ''O Krishna ! O Krishna ! You are our lord. '' ''You are the supreme lord. You are the dharma. '' ''A demon was proud of conquering Indra's kingdom. '' ''To destroy his arrogance, lord Hari turned into a dwarf. '' ''Lord Hari went to him and asked him for three feet land. '' ''And he destroyed Shukra's eye who tried to be a hurdle on his path. '' ''He destroyed his eye. '' ''And then grew in size. - And then?'' ''And then he covered earth with one feet. . '' ''. .and covered sky with another feet. . '' ''. .and then with the third feet he crushed Bali into hell. '' ''O Krishna ! O Krishna ! You are our lord. '' ''You are the supreme lord. You are the dharma. '' ''Brothers, did you hear. . '' ''. .the tales of young Krishna?'' ''If there is no envy and jealousy. . '' ''. .everyone's life will be beautiful. '' ''If we don't listen to others, we will live in peace. '' ''If brothers live together, everyone will be happy. '' ''And if God is there with us, then our lives will become heaven. '' ''O Krishna ! O Krishna ! You are our lord. '' ''You are the supreme lord. You are the dharma. '' ''You are the dharma. '' ''You are the dharma. '' Oh ! It's too deep. What shall we do now? Bheema is the reason behind all this. What was the need throw you so much force? Do you want me to throw it like a skinny guy like you? Ok, wait. There is no need to fight. First of all let us find a way to take it out. It's too deep. How do we take it out? We have to tie someone with a rope and put him inside it. You are right. Viluka will be apt for us. He's very light. We can pull him easily. Oh God ! Leave me. I won't get into the well. Viluka, do not get scared. I'm here. I will hold the rope tight. - And where's the rope? Let's use the bands on our bodies. . . .and tie them. It will be as long as we want. Bring your bands. Viluka is running away. Hold him. - Oh God ! Oh God ! No. No. I will die. Leave me. Leave me. Leave me. I'm scared. I'm scared. Leave me. Leave me. Stop it. Stop it. What's going on over there! Why are you throwing that kid into the well? You came here like God. They are throwing me. . . . into the well to take out the ball. Please help me. Is there no other way to take out the ball? You look like princes. Haven't your master taught you archery? Salutations to the saint, but what is the relation. . . . between archery and the ball. He who is good at archery can do anything. Anything is possible for him. See this. Brother-in-law, what a great talent! Saint Krupacharya, who is this great saint? He's my brother-in-law saint Dhronacharya. Brother-in-law. - Brother-in-law. - Brother. How are you, sister? - What shall I tell you, brother! Your brother has acquired mastery in archery. . . . but we still have problems in earning for a survival. We don't even have enough means to buy milk for our son. . . .and here we are wandering all over the world. A master archer is such a poor state? Had he gone to any kingdom he would've been received. . . .with open arms! - But it's not in his nature. . . .to go to someone to ask for something. Even when he went to the great saint Parasurama. . . . he accepted fruits that he offered him. . . . but he couldn't tell him about his dire financial condition. You are saint Parasurama's disciple? He's my master as well. Dhroncharya, thus we become brothers. Fellow-disciples. Do not say no to us and kindly come to our kingdom. . . .and teach our princes the art of archery. Do not think too much about it, brother-in-law. I have taught them all the arts that I knew. Now you must teach them archery. Please accept Bheeshma's offer. - Alright. There's nothing more pleasurable in this world. . . .than teaching. I would be happy to teach. . . .the deserving kids. - We are happy. Disciples, first of all I need to test your present skills. Look there. There's a bird on that tree. I want you to take aim on the right eye of that bird. Suyodhana. Take aim at the bird's eye. Can you see the tree? - Yes, I can see the tree. Can you see the branch? - I can see the branch. . . .and I can also see the sky. The bird? - What are these questions, master? My parents can't see, but I can see very well. You can? I don't think so. Suyodhana, he who doesn't obey his master. . . .can never be a good student. You can't leave this art. Go away. Bheema. - Yes, master. Can you see the bird? - Yes, master. I can see the bird. Branch? - I can also see the branch, master. Bird? - I can see it very well, master. Bheema, you can't master the art of archery. Go away. As you order, master. Arjuna. Can you see the tree? - No. Branch? - No. Bird? - No. Then what's visible to you? Bird's right eye is visible to me, master. - Then hit the bird. Disciples, did you know it now how to take your aim? You must also take aim like Arjun. Salutations, my lord. Salutations. My son is dying to learn archery from you. Kindly make him your disciple. - Who are you? My name is Vasadi Singari. In my village I am known as Hiranyadamyu. . . .and my son is known as Ekalavya. You are the right teacher for him. I am sorry, but you are from a lower caste. It's against dharma to teach you archery. Master, my son came here with lot of hope. Kindly do not break his dreams. I cannot help you. I cannot teach someone against dharma. Lord, I came here with many dreams. I cannot think anyone else as my teacher. Have mercy on me and teach me archery. I beg you. Kindly do not say no. I cannot go against dharma. I cannot teach you. Master, I treated you as my teacher. I will make your statue and worship you. . . .and learn archery on my own. Give me your blessings, lord. Alright. You can do that. Fulfill your wish. Great, my son. Today you made me proud. Nakula. Sahadeva. Remove the fire. What's that sound in the darkness? Forgive me, lord. I am trying to achieve mastery. . . . in the art of hitting the target in the dark. - Great. Great. How did you think of it, son? Once at night during dinnertime. . . .the candles went off, and since I saw the dishes. . . .that were there on the leaf I could eat in the dark. And I realized that we can hit the target even in the dark. Great, Arjuna. Great. Your dexterity is matchless. I will teach you everything that I have learnt. There won't be a better archer than you in this world. It's my oath. Duryodhana, you cannot hit a person below his waist. . . . in the mace-war. It's against rules. Keep that in mind. Alright, master. Duryodhana, it's wrong. You did it intentionally this time. It is unpardonable. How can it be wrong when I did it for self-defense, master! You are arguing with me. It's wrong. I am saying this for your welfare. If you do such kind of immoral things. . . . it will be harmful to you in future. That's sufficient for today. In the mace-war Bheema has beaten up my son mercilessly. There are wounds all over his body. You said that that arrogant Bheema. . . . is as strong as Naga. How will my son fight him! I wonder what will happen to my son. Do not worry, sister. If Bheema has as much strength as Naga. . . .we will get Suyodhana as tougher body. I made arrangements for that. You need not worry anymore. Aghori. Queen Gandhari, take Amruta-Varshini's blessings. Aghori, explain it to her how the prince's body. . . .will become as hard as iron. Abracadabra. Here are those invaluable leaves and roots. On the festive day, at mid-night. . . .while worshiping mother Amruta-Varshini. . . .you have to crush these roots and leaves and with your hands. . . .you have to apply that extract on each part of your son's body. . . .and his body will become iron-hard. I am blessed. - Sister, tomorrow it's an auspicious day. You can perform this vow tomorrow itself. It's my responsibility to bring Suyodhana here. Welcome, saint Valmiki. Your arrival has made our monastery auspicious. Our disciples are also blessed. They got an opportunity. . . .to showcase their talent in front of you. Today my wishes have come true. I wanted to see all these disciples together. He is my chief disciple Balarama. He is Sudhama. People call him Kuchela. Accept our salutations. - Give us your blessings. Please accept it as a gift from us. - I am pleased to receive it. Dharmaja, take it. Share it with your brothers. Saint. Vayu-nandana( son of wind-God), greetings! Cousin, you recognized me even before. . . .I could introduce myself! We don't need introductions from sun and moon. Arjuna. - Cousin. Son of mother Devaki. - I am very pleased. I am pleased that you are a mace-fighter. Suyodhana. Master ordered us to share this fruit among ourselves. Brother, make two halves of this fruit. We'll get one half and the Kauravas will get the other half. What are you saying ! The five of you will get one piece each. . . .and the rest of the fruit will be ours. - No. - Yes. Krishna, come here. You already started creating differences between them. What have I done, brother? - Today you are making them. . . .fight for a fruit, tomorrow you will make them fight. . . .for the kingdom. - No, brother. Do not make such baseless accusations on me. Krishna, I know you very well. Suyodhana, you know how it feels to get beaten up by me. If you trouble me, I will bash you up again. Bheema, you shouldn't fight with your brother. Suyodhana, you can have this fruit. If you want to give us, you can give us a share. Krishna, you are the father, mother, guru, god. . . .and everything for my children. It's your responsibilities to look after them. That's my dharma. You can live peacefully. May I go now? Hail Mother Amruta-varshini ! Satyasena. Satyasena. - Yes, sister-in-law. Is it not mid-night yet? Hasn't the auspicious moment arrived yet? No, sister-in-law. There still some time left. Is Suyodhana here? Is he getting ready? - Yes, he is. Look, Satyasena. No one other than Suyodhana. . . .can come here. Go and close the gates. - Alright, sister-in-law. Aunt Gandhari, accept Krishna's salutations. It's Krishna? - Yes. - Welcome, son. You came here after a long time, but I'm not in a position. . . .to give you a good reception. I am in the middle of the vow. Aunt, you need not worry about the reception. It's enough if you are happy to see me here. By the way, what's that vow about? It's a ladies' vow, son. Krishna. - Yes, aunt. I heard that you have a great understanding. . . .about the political affairs of the kingdom. Son, the envious world might tell you some lies. . . .about my son. I want you to help my spotless sons. . . .when they are in trouble. I am always on the side of dharma, aunt. Sister-in-law, the auspicious time is passing by. She is right. You should complete your vow. Shall I go now? Satyasena. - Sister-in-law. Did he leave? - Yes. Close that door and call Suyodhana. Go. Brother. Brother. What's this! Why did you remove your clothes? Dushala, what are you doing here? This is my chamber. What are you doing here? Suyodhana, come fast. - Go there. The auspicious time is passing by. - Suyodhana. Son, from today onwards your body will become as hard as iron. Even if the mountains crush you, you won't die. Bheema has great strength. He won't be able to do anything now. After touching your body. . . . his mace will be broken into pieces. What's this! I ordered you to come here. . . . removing all your clothes. - You are right. But I felt ashamed to remove all my clothes. . . . in front of that Dushala. - O lord ! What have I done wrong in my vow! Will your thighs always be weak? How unfortunate! Greetings. Offer my salutations. . . .to the king of Gandhara. - O Krishna ! Your greetings have won my heart. I learnt greetings people from you. Goodbye. I never knew that my own daughter will be our enemy. How can she do such a thing ! There she is. She's coming here with uncle. Dushala ! Why are you shouting at me! What have I done wrong? You can't do anything worse. - You came to the chamber. . . .and stood in front of me. - You had spoilt all my wishes. What are you saying, sister! In order to avoid such mishap. . . .I felt her with me all day long. Now I understood it. This is Krishna's conspiracy. Saint Dhronacharya, your reception is great. Shall we go now? Balarama, where is Krishna? Krishna. Arjuna, you must be the best in this art form. - Alright, cousin. I will be the best in archery. Foolish cousin, a better archer is there in this forest itself. Take your master's permission and go to hunting. You will know it on your own. Lift it. Lift it. Stop there. This is our province. To hunt here you need to take our permission first. Who are you? This is our kingdom. We will do whatever we wish. I just warned you, if you still don't listen to me. . What will you do? If you don't stop talking we will hunt you. Is that so! Fire. Fire. Master. Master. Help! Help! Master. Master. Help! Help! Fire. Fire. Arjuna, use the rain-arrow and put off that fire. Fire. Fire. - Hail the master! Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Rain. Rain. Master, give me your blessings. Ekalavya, it's you? From which master did you achieve. . . .such proficiency in archery? The master who taught you has taught me these skills. Saint Dhrona is my master. - It's me? I taught you the archery? - Yes, lord. Yes. I built your statue and treated it as my master. I worshiped you day and night. You always kept whispering your invaluable guidance. . . . in my ears. 'There won't be a better archer than you in this world. ' 'It's my oath. ' Master, it's only because I built your statue and worshipped it. . . .that I mastered the art of archery. Kindly come to my house and honor it. It's an auspicious day. My master came to my province. Today it's a festive day. Today it's celebration time. Everyone come here. ''Here it is. Here it is. '' ''Here it is. Here it is. The festive season is here. '' ''My master is here. '' ''My master came to our province. It's a delight for the eyes. '' ''He came here for the first time. He is my master. '' ''He came here for the first time. He is my master. '' ''I shall bring the Ganges here and wash his feet. '' ''I shall bring the Ganges here and wash his feet. '' ''I will blow the drums. I will ring the bells. '' ''I will blow the drums. I will ring the bells. I will blow the conches. '' ''I will garland him. I will garland him. '' ''Here it is. Here it is. The festive season is here. '' ''He's the greatest master. No one is as good as he is. '' ''I learn everything from him. '' ''There is no such person in this world. '' ''We shall worship him one by one. '' ''We shall worship him one by one. '' ''We shall offer him our lives. '' ''Here it is. Here it is. The festive season is here. '' ''My master is here. '' ''My master came to our province. It's a delight for the eyes. '' Master, this is your disciple. This is our land. And these are our men. Tell me what I shall offer you. I will give you. You won't go back on your word after I ask you, right? Master, if your disciple goes back on his word. . . . it will be an insult to you. And your disciple will never let you down. Then cut your right thumb and give it to me as my fee. Is that all? I will offer it to you from the bottom of my heart. I will give it to you right now. Saint. This is not right on your part. Asking for his thumb is like asking for his head. After teaching him the art do not waste it. You can ask for anything else. Take my finger. Take my land. Take my reputation. I will offer you everything that I have, saint. I will offer you my tears. Have mercy on my son. Have mercy on him. Father, you are the one who told me. . . .that one should not go back on his word. . . .and death would be better than doing that. If your son doesn't offer him what he asked for. . . . it will bring defame to you. I cannot let you down, father. I have to fulfill master's wish. Wipe out your tears and bring a smile on your face. . . .and help me offer him my finger. Yes, son. Yes. You are my son. You will never say no. You will never say no. I might not know why you asked for such a thing. . . .why you become so merciless. . . . but lord definitely knows it. You will definitely bear the consequences. Why did you do such a thing ! Why did you bring such a scar on your spotless life! I never knew that you would behave so ruthlessly. Fate is the most ruthless. There is a strong reason behind every action of a human. It's God's wish. Even the best of the human beings. . . .can't go against their destiny. Do not worry about my deed. Witness the great talent of my disciples. Come with me. The future king of this kingdom. . . .the eldest son of the dynasty, queen Kunti's son Dharmaja. . . . is about to showcase his skills. He has already crowned Dharmaja as the king. It's just his love for him, sister. Dharmaja. Now Bheema and Suyodhana will participate. . . . in the mace-fight. Bheema. Suyodhana. Suyodhana, great! Great, brother! Who's winning? - Sister, it's not a battle. It's just to showcase their skills. There is no question of winning or losing. That's not possible. When two people are fighting. . . .only one person can win the fight. Save yourself, Bheema. I will break your hands. I will break your head. They are baying for each other's blood. Ashwadhama, go there and stop them. - Stop it. Stop it. Master ordered you to stop the fight. Stop it. I am punishing you for not listening. . . .to your master's order. Get out of the field. Now the great archer Arjuna will showcase. . . . his archery skills. Arjuna. What happened? What happened? My son has set fire with his archery skills. Hail Arjuna ! - What happened now? Arjuna put off the flames with the rain-arrow. I am proud of Arjuna's archery skills. There is no better archer in this world. No. There is one. If you give me a chance I will prove it to everyone. . . .that I am a better archer than Arjuna. Who is your master? - Which master teaches the birds flying. . . .the fishes swimming? Who is the master of the flowers. . . .which emit fragrance and the volcanic mountains? God is the master of all the living beings. He is my master. Great. First he created clouds and then he dispersed them. Saint, do you accept it now that I am better. . . .than your disciple? Give us your permission. . . .to fight each other and showcase our skills. Give him a chance. - Give him a chance. Why are you silent, saint? - I know the meaning. . . .of the saint's silence. Karna, princes fight. . . .only with the equals, but they don't fight with others. It's against their dharma. You can tell which caste and tribe you belong to. . . .and then you can fight Arjuna. Why are you silent? It's injustice. To save Arjuna from him. . . .the saints are shielding Arjuna with this excuse. Saint Krupa, he who is born in high caste. . . .and he who has courage and army is called a king. Father. Father, I heard that there is no king in Anga territory. I beg you to make Karna the king of Anga. . . . let him give a fair chance to showcase his skills. What do you say? - Giving someone a fair chance. . . .to showcase his skills is not wrong. Give him your permission. Right now, at this stage I am making. . . . Karna the king of Anga. Hail king Karna of Anga ! Hail king Karna of Anga ! Hail king Karna of Anga ! Arjuna, I, the king of Anga am challenging you to fight me. If you have the courage to fight me, you can step forward. So you think you are a king? You are challenging me? You got pride as soon as you got the crown? Your pride will also disappear like the disappearing sun. The sun is setting. We shall stop it here today. Aswadhama, ask them to blow the final horn. Karna, from today onwards we are friends. Our friendship shall survive forever. How can I forget you who rescued me at the right time. . . .and made me the king ! I will offer my life, skills, fame and everything to you. I swear on the Sun-God. Salutations to the king. Mother, my friend Karna, the king of Anga. . . . is offering you salutations. Give him your blessings. Salutations, mother. - You fame may raise manifold, son. Son. Karna. Come here, son. Take your mother's blessings. - What! My enemy's mother is blessings me? If sons fight each other people will accuse the mother. . . .of improper upbringing, son. I want everyone to live happily. May you lead a happy life, son. Mother. King of Anga, come with me. We shall go now. Radha. Cast off the evil eye from your son as soon as you go home. Definitely. Mother, your son won the battle. . . .and you are shedding tears? These are the tears of happiness, son. Stop the chariot. What's this? - There are the presents for the master. We were waiting for these. Give it to us. Not to you, but your Bheeshma said that. . . . Dharmaja should present them to your master. . . .on behalf of all the disciples. Has grandfather become mad? When the future king of this kingdom is here. . . .why did he ask that Dharmaja to go this honor! Pandavas are surviving here on our mercy. Brothers, get hold of the presents. How arrogant! He dared to go against grandfather's order! They will regret it later. You stay calm. Master, accept these diamonds, these ornaments. . . .this wealth as fee and give this courageous prince. . . .and his brothers your blessings. . . . before we leave this place. Where are the Pandavas? - They are the poor. . . .who cannot give you any presents. They must be. . . .ashamed of themselves and must have left this place. . . .without informing anyone. - I know Pandavas well. They will never step out of this place. . . .without their master's permission. May your fame increase manifold ! Arjuna, you are your master's favorite disciple. Why are you so upset? - That's the reason, mother. Master said that there will not be a better disciple than me. But Ekalavya gave him the invaluable fee. . . .and left me far behind, mother. We are unable to understand what we should. . . . present our master as fee. I cannot tell you what he wants, but there is something. . . .that has made him upset since a long time. What is that? - When Ashwadhama was an infant. . . .our condition was so bad that we couldn't even afford. . . .a glass of milk and I couldn't bear this poverty. Your master and Panchala's king got education together. . . .from the same master. He said that he can even give half of his kingdom. . . . if your master ever needs it. I reminded your master of that word and sent him to that king. Then. . I am king Dhrupata whose fame is spread. . . .across the world. And you will tell me what I should do? You came here to ask me for help? You will get nothing. You arrogant king, you will definitely get punished. . . .for this insult. Then you will learn what you've done wrong. I assure you of that. He couldn't punish him till now. And he is suffering from that pain. Father, your son returned after mastering all the arts. . . .and offering you his salutations. Mother, I returned after offering. . . .the invaluable presents to my master. Suyodhana, where are the Pandavas? Didn't you all offer the presents together? They didn't come with us. We waited for them. . . . but when they didn't come we gave away the presents. . . .and came back. Our soldiers said that they went out of this kingdom. Master, this is what you wanted since a long time. We took your revenge as the fee. Please accept our fee and give us your blessings. Arjuna, today my teaching has borne fruits. Who is he? You are the same king. . . .who fame is spread across the world? Are you king Dhrupata? You are lying at the feet of a poor man? Friend Dhronacharya, forgive me. I became arrogant because of my throne. Forgive me. - Arjuna, untie him. Hail the master! King Dhrupada, though I regret that you were. . . . brought to our kingdom in this manner I am happy. . . .that your childhood friendship has renewed. Lord Bheeshma, I am happy that I got an opportunity. . . .to see you, even though it's in these circumstances. King of Panchala, my grandchildren. . . . imprisoned you only to take their master's revenge. . . . but they don't have any personal enmity against you. Arjuna. - Grandfather. Ask him forgiveness. - Forgive me, king. Son, your dynasty who got you as a son. . . .and my friend Dhronacharya who got you as his disciple. . . .are blessed. Son, I wish I had a son like you. I would've been blessed. You are right. They met in the battlefield. . . . but still you can take him your home as your son-in-law. Pitamaha, am I that fortunate. I need to pray lord to get a son-in-law like Arjuna. Friend, start praying to get such a blessing. Arjuna, your fee is matchless. No disciple can give better fee to his master, son. Master, I wonder what fee my cousin Krishna. . . . is about to give his master. How is he who dared to call me. . . .the God of death ! Who wants to get death-penalty! Who is that arrogant fellow! Yamadharamraja( God of death ), enough of it. You are insulting the lord who incarnated. . . .for the prosperity of the world? You can see my brother's greatness. . . . if you open your eyes and see him. Lord, what's the reason behind your arrival. Send my master's son back with me whom you brought here. ''Lord, how is possible to send back a human being who has already died. '' ''Is it possible for the rivers to go back to. . . .their origins after meeting the ocean?'' ''This is the law of nature. '' ''O lord, how shall I break this law?'' ''Dharma, death and lives occur according to my wish. '' ''What I do is dharma ! '' ''To serve my master on planet earth. . '' ''. .I have to save my master's son. '' ''Send back my master's son. '' As you wish, lord. Sandeep Kumara. Sandeep Kumara, your parents are waiting for you. We shall go now. May I take your leave now? Master, here is your son. Father. - Son. Father. - Son. Father. - You are back, son. You are back. Dear. Dear, our son is back. Krishna and Balarama brought him back. Son. - Mother. Son. - Mother. Son. Son. Krishna. Balarama. I wonder how we shall thank you. . . .and how we will repay your debt. Krishna. Balarama. I am blessed to be your master. May all your wishes come true. . . .and may your name be famous till eternity. True. True. How true it is. This sight is a boon to eyes. Today it's a festive day. Human and God both achieved great victories. . . .on the same day, and offered fee to their masters. . . . in the same way. Human being also offered fee to his master? Narada, what are you talking about? Arjuna defeated and imprisoned. . . .the might king Dhrupada and made him touch. . . . his master's feet and beg for forgiveness. What's the benefit in destroying. . . .others' arrogance, Narada ! One should be able to. . . . kill the arrogance and envy of the near and dear ones. Near and dear ones? Now I understood it. Now I understood it. . .and Gandhari's envy, right? - Not just that. . . . but if you offer prayers to lord, it will make your life prosperous. I understood it. You are ordering me. . . .to start a new chapter in this act. I will fulfill your wish. I shall go now. Hail lord Narayana ! Hail lord Narayana ! My sons cannot become as famous as those Pandavas? Do not worry, queen. How can we expect more fruits by putting less effort! I am ready to put any effort for my sons' welfare. I am ready to perform any vow. If someone tells me which vow to perform. . Hail lord Narayana ! Hail lord Narayana ! - Who's that? Saint Narayana ! Please be seated. You came here on hearing my grief. Saint, tell me which vow I shall perform. . . .for my son's fame and welfare. There's a great elephant called Iravatam. The mother who worships that elephant gets her sons' welfare. Iravatam vow? What's the procedure of that vow? This vow was started by Mother Gauri in Kailasham. That's why this vow is also known as Gaja Gauri vow. You need to get the Iravatam and roam the entire province on that elephant. . .and you have to give the holy offerings. . . .to hundred mothers who have sons. How will Iravatam come down to earth? This vow seems to be a difficult one. If you want great fruits you will have to take great efforts. . . .for that. The saints and ancestors knew that we humans. . . . might face difficultly in performing these vows. . . .so they gave some concessions. They said it every now and then. . . .that if we don't get gold we can use silver. . . . if we don't get silver, we can use bronze. . . . if we don't get bronze, we can use mud. If you can't get Iravatam, then build him replica with mud. . . .and worship it. - What! How can one make a mud-elephant. . . .walk in the kingdom? - You don't know that? We can fix wheels to it. - She is right. I will get the elephant build tomorrow itself. You can't build it. - You are right. If uncle touches it the elephant will become inauspicious. That's not the thing, dear. When you build. . . .the mud-elephant, it must be done by sons. That's why they say that any mother can perform this vow. . . . if she has sons. - Great. So aunt Kunti can also perform this vow. Dushala, you stay quiet. Saint, tell us an auspicious moment. . . .to build the mud-elephant. The next Hasta-star is an auspicious day. Get the mud on that day and build the elephant. How difficult is that! We are hundred brothers. We will get the mud and build the replica of Iravatam. May God bless you ! - Saint, you must stay here. . . .and oversee this vow. - I will be here. But it's the Lord who makes everything possible. Hail lord Narayana ! Hail lord Narayana ! ''It's great, elder cousin. '' ''It's great, younger cousin. '' ''We never saw this miracle before. '' ''You are matchless. '' ''It's great, elder cousin. '' ''It's great, younger cousin. '' ''You are hundred brothers. '' ''You are thunders. '' ''You are hundred brothers. '' ''You are thunders. '' ''You brought the mud. . '' ''. .and built the elephant. '' ''. .and built the elephant. '' ''You are brave. You are courageous. '' ''It's great, elder cousin. '' ''It's great, younger cousin. '' ''Your mother expressed a wish and you are fulfilling it. '' ''A mother can't ask for more. '' ''A mother can't ask for more. '' ''This is not a lie. But such people won't be born again and again. '' ''It's great, elder cousin. '' ''It's great, younger cousin. '' ''There are drums, there are colors. There are colorful umbrellas. '' ''There are drums, there are colors. There are colorful umbrellas. '' ''The entire province is filled with green leaves. '' ''I offer my salutations. '' ''The entire province is filled with green leaves. '' ''I offer my salutations. '' ''It's a festive season all around. Everyone is celebrating. '' ''It's great, elder cousin. '' ''It's great, younger cousin. '' ''We never saw this miracle before. '' ''You are matchless. '' Mother, won't give you the holy offering to aunt Kunti? To that widow? No. But I heard that it doesn't matter if the lady is a widow. . . .and that anyone who has sons can accept this holy offering. You don't know anything. Keep quiet. Mother, why didn't they stop it in front of our house? Why didn't you get the holy offering? Radha, take the holy offering. Mother, you are giving me the holy offering? Yes, Radha. You are valiant Karna's son. Take it. - I accept it, queen. Mother, aunt Gandhari has given the holy offerings. . . .to Karna's mother. Why did she ignore you? - It's alright, son. I can't tolerate it. We must teach them a lesson. It took them 100 brothers to build that elephant. I can build that elephant single-handedly. - Son. Bheema. Hail grandfather Aryaka ! Brother Bheema ! Bheema. Bheema. - Do not get scared. I am throwing the mud-pieces on the shore. Be careful. What are you doing here! Go away. We won't leave. - Will you leave or not? Uncle, eat this. My hunger is quenched a long ago, nephew. Defaming Pandavas fills our stomach. Have it. Mother, brother Bheema has grown so big. He is throwing the mud-pieces and destroying everything. Yes, mother. You must come. - Let's go, son. Bheema, you are destroying everything. Calm down, son. Calm down. Son. Bheema. Son, don't bring me the defame. . . .that my son is destroying the kingdom. Mother, no. This is for your vow. We brothers will build the mud-elephant. Our mother will perform the vow with a mud-elephant? We will bring the Iravatam. Come down. Is that possible? - Yes, it is possible. Nothing is impossible for human being. You come down first of all. Iravatam is in the heaven. How will we get it? It's not difficult. We will send an epistle to lord Indra. . . .to send Iravatam. - I will send that epistle. I will bring down Iravatam. I will make mother perform the vow. You come down first. Come down, son. - Hail grandfather Aryaka ! Where did this arrow come from? It seems that that arrow came from earth. Master, please read it. This is Arjuna's message to the king of heaven. My mother wished to perform Iravatam's vow. Kindly send your elephant. I will send your another message. . . .after we receive Iravatam. How can Devendra send his elephant to planet earth ! How arrogant is he! We must teach him a lesson for this misdeed. Dharmaraja, do not be upset. You saw it just now. No human being could send a message to heaven. . . .with his arrow. Devendra, that human is none. . . . but one of the lord's incarnations. He's a human being. But still we have to think about it, Indra. Even if he's a human being or a God. . . . he won't get that elephant. But do not forget that Arjuna is your son. I can't have any mercy on him just because he is my son. If he is that powerful ask him to come here. . . .and defeat it and take it with him. Master, send our message to him. Lord Indra sent his wishes to Arjuna. Didn't he send Iravatam? - He said that he would send. . . .Iravatam if you send your man to heaven. Now it's up to you. I will build a ladder to heaven with my arrows. And I will go to heaven and bring Iravam here. May your wish come true! ''The human being is magnificent. '' ''The human being is magnificent. '' ''He is strong. He is determination. '' ''The human being is magnificent. '' ''There is no stopping him if he walks on the righteous path. '' ''A human can even make the God come down to earth. '' ''The human being is magnificent. '' ''The human being is magnificent. '' ''Baghiratha who brought Ganges to earth is a human being. '' ''Dhruva who turned into a star is also a human being. '' ''Saint Vishwamitra is also a saint. '' ''All these achievers are humans. '' ''The human being is magnificent. '' ''The human being is magnificent. '' ''He crossed the planets and the stars. '' ''He crossed the planets and the stars. '' ''He reached the end of the sky. '' ''The Chandralok( world of moon-god) and the Devendralok. . '' ''He can touch the Chandralok and the Devendralok. . '' ''. .and come back to earth. '' ''The human being is magnificent. '' ''He is strong. He is determination. '' ''The human being is magnificent. '' ''The human being is magnificent. '' Salutations the lord of heaven. . . .from Pandavas and Kunti's third son. As per your wish my brother sent me here. Send Iravatam with me. Son, Iravatam is very powerful. Everyone can't tame it. And you are just a kid. If you have the strength to tame it. . . .I do not have any objection. What do you say? I am pleased with your generosity. Karma, Bheema must have reached heaven by now. You have to destroy the ladder. . . .so that he could never return to earth. Burn that ladder with one of your arrows. It's not the right thing to do on our part. It's against dharma. - I don't care if it's against dharma. I accepted you as my best friend. That day you made a promise in front of everyone. Will you go back on your word now? Do not worry, Suyodhana. Do not worry. I will do anything that you ask for. Even if the world says that it's against dharma. . . .I will bear that disgrace for your sake. Karna, that's what true friendship is. Do not wait further. Shakuni. You didn't quit your evilness yet. You won't get forgiveness after corrupting children's minds. Karna, you dared to commit such crimes. . . .for the sake of friendship. Is that why you won. . . . Sun-god's heart and learnt your skills from him? This friendship might lead to your destruction. I must punish these evil forces. Imprison them. Dharmaja. Arjuna. Do not be scared. Dharma always wins. Our Bheema can come back to earth with God's blessings. Mother. - Bheema. Bheema. Son. Hail grandfather Aryaka ! Bheema. Bheema. Bheema. I will send Iravatam with you. Come down. Come down. Hail grandfather Aryaka ! O great Bheema, I am pleased. Your valor is matchless. I will send Iravatam with you today itself. Your mother can perform the Iravatam vow. . . .without any hurdle. Iravatam. Go to planet earth with Bheema. . . .and help them perform the vow. Narada, you are the one who suggested them. . . .to perform this vow. You go there and oversee the vow. Meghadoota, take them to planet earth. Hail lord Narayana ! Hail lord Narayana ! Hail Bheema ! Hail the Pandavas! Hail Bheema ! Hail the Pandavas! Hail Mother Kunti ! Hail the Pandavas! Hail Mother Kunti ! Hail the Pandavas! Hail Bheema ! Hail the Pandavas! Suyodhana. Suyodhana. Iravatam is here. The vow is being performed in a grand way. A vow is being performed. You too go with them. Go. Hail Mother Kunti ! Hail the Pandavas! Man proposes and god disposes. I had so many dreams to make my sons. . . .greater than Kunti's son. All my dreams have crashed. Pandavas are succeeding and my son faced disgrace. And my envy is the reason behind everything. Hail Mother Kunti ! Hail the Pandavas! Hail Mother Kunti ! Hail the Pandavas! Is Kunti coming to our place? No. Why would she come here! She won't come here. I insulted Kunti without giving her the holy offering. I don't deserve to get the holy offering from her. I must get punished. - Mother. Mother. Aunt came here to give you the holy offering. To me? No, Dushala. I am not that fortunate. What are you saying, sister! With you blessings I decided to perform the Iravatam vow. Whom else will I give the holy offering, sister? Please accept it. The holy offering? You brought it for me? - Yes, it's for you. Accept it, queen Gandhari. Who is that? Is it saint Naradha? Are you helping her perform the vow? - Yes, queen. I told you that day itself that it's the Lord. . . .who makes everything possible. He just made me a messenger and helped your sister perform the vow. You are right. How can I get the great saint's help. . . .after bringing a mud-elephant for the vow! Sister Kunti, you are really very fortunate. You gave birth to great sons. With their help you are performing the vow. . . .and getting fame and goodwill for them. We too have sons. We have 100 sons. But they are of no use. Parents' responsibilities are not over. . . .just after giving birth to kids. You must also show them the right path. Only then will you get sweet fruits. You can follow Kunti for that. - You are right. I got jealous and greedy. I wanted my son. . . .to become the king and turned into an immoral person. Father-in-law, forgive me. At least from now onwards I will try to lead. . . .a life without committing any mistakes. Give me the holy offering, sister. Sister, may your sons get all the fame and happiness. . . . in the world and you may lead a peaceful life. I am blessed. Dharmaja, come here and take your aunt's blessings. Aunt, I am offering you my salutations. . . .along with my brother. - God bless you. God bless you. Dharmaja. - Yes, aunt. You are the most suitable person for the king's throne. You will definitely get the crown sooner or later. May that wish come true. I am so fortunate. Grandfather, I have a small request on this occasion. Why don't you release brother Suyodhana. . . .and uncle Shakuni from the prison? Definitely. Definitely. - Hail lord Narayana ! Krishna, it's all because of your blessings.
