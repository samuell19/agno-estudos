UNDER THE FIG TREE There you go! Here, take your dummy. There you go. Hurry up, girls! Don't dawdle, we'll be late. Come on! Mind your feet! This car isn't a dump! - I can't believe this! - No! Put your seatbelt on. You won't let me go round the car. I can't take this anymore! Baste it, baste it now! - Could you come here, Nathalie? - Coming. I shouldn't get mad but I need your help with this. Do you understand? I need your help. I need your help to do this. Is that so hard to understand? Hey! Don't slow down! - Are you focused, Louis? - Yes, Chef. I should take the strawberry cake off the menu. No one orders it. The boss said I would no longer have an assistant in July. The director would like to see you. He's doing this on purpose! We're in a rush here! This isn't the time, we're opening soon. I know there are only 10 covers. What do you want me to do? Revive the global economy? - We could talk calmly. - I am calm! You hired me three years ago so I could cook traditional food, for which I have won a Michelin star! Precisely, I don't want to lose our star. My star! I talked to Pierre, he's happy to go to the "White Inn". They need an assistant. You can still cook with your own style, with a woman specialised in fusion cuisine. You know fusion cuisine? Of course, chemistry and natural products. - Chemistry? - Nitrogen and colouring. Well, it's new. - It's special but... - I like new. And I love special. But where's the fusion between my stew and my eels? I'm only asking you to try. Sandrine Levier would be your assistant. - You'd agree on a menu together. - What are we doing in here? Why doesn't it ever work for me? It'd go faster if you'd look in your pockets. I forgot my goulash! Yum! We should really take that trip to your homeland. I'm not so keen on it anymore. I'd rather just keep my memories in my head. When I left Hungary with Piotr, we knew we'd never go back. During his lessons, he'd show us pictures of him as a dancer and play us Hungarian songs to relax us during tests. How long were you married for? 42 years. It was so hard when we first arrived in Belgium. The passion between us almost disappeared. But when love is at stake, you have to hold on for dear life, or you'll drown. What about you? Sticking with sea metaphors, I don't want to drown, spend three years recovering and take another plunge. After two marriages and two divorces, raising my kid alone, wonderful and disastrous affairs, and after almost 50 years of good and faithful service, I should be able to have fun too. Isn't that my right? - What about Bernard? - It's over with him. He keeps calling and you just run away. It's not over. But I was still hungry! What's with all the pills in the bin? I tidied up my medicine cabinet. That's good. I told you, I'm not negotiating! Do as I say! Put your tights on now! - No! I hate them! - There you go, love. It's like this every day! - Every single day! - Come on! I don't want to! - I don't have time for this. - I don't want to! - No! - I don't have time. - Dad, stop! - Grab your schoolbag. Stop it! There you go! Let's put your little hat on. I said get your bag! What now? I can't believe this. She's burning up with fever. She's going to explode! I will be the one who explodes. Hi Annick, this is Christophe. Are you home? I have a very important meeting. There you go, honey. Here, thank you so much! Here's the doctor's number. If you make it sound bad, he'll come. You're the best ex ever! - Hi, Annick. - Hi, honey. Bye! Hi, how are you? Crap... Crap, I gave her the dry-cleaner's number. It looks like a pigeon took a crap on you. No, it's just some throw-up. A bit of throw-up from... Can I smoke one more? Go on then. When the girl near the radiator faints, we'll take her table and I'll undress. To make it up to you, I'll meet this Madam Irma. I'm sure she could help you if you weren't so judgmental. What could really help me would be to be slightly more free. Last night, I was supposed to spend the evening with a girl I really liked. Agathe had invited two friends over and they were all yelling. Aurélie almost drowned Zoé in the bathtub. While I was resuscitating her... my fiancée asked Agathe's friend how many kids I had. She found it funny when she said eight. When I got back to the living-room with champagne, my new fiancée was already an ex. She was gone and I drank champagne, alone in front of Shrek 2. I'm sure it'd calm you to talk to Selma. But I am calm. As calm as a Belgian politician. Sorry for being so romantic, for believing in meeting someone. I'm sure Madam Irma would agree with that. I still can't believe that Sandra went to Canada and left the girls behind. She didn't abandon them. She sees them every six weeks. It might be better than a mother who works 15 hours a day and weekends. For years, I only saw my daughter in the mornings. I'm sure there are tons of girls longing for you at work. Eight are married, one is completely crazy, and one's a knockout but sleeps with everyone. Thanks a lot! Excuse me, Miss, may I? How long have I known you? 15 years? I remember the first time I met you in Bernard's office. He said: "This is my new assistant." I liked you right away. And you're the one I kept. Right, ruining all my suits crying on my shoulder after all your fights with Bernard... You know he's back in Brussels? Don't you want to give him a second chance? A seventh, you mean? No. My happiness won't depend on a man's love anymore. One thing's certain, us two are by ourselves. Bye. Hi Ninon, it's Mum. Have you had dinner already? Is it already 9 pm? Right, well then... Go to bed then, never mind. Roger. Roger! MUM, IF I DON'T SEE YOU IN THE MORNING, COULD YOU SIGN MY TEST? DAD ALWAYS FORGETS! The lover from the past keeps coming up. Forget about him and look to the future. You're a medium! I'm no medium. You've picked this card three times. Forget about it. Can I have some juice? Sure, help yourself. I have an idea for you. You could eat in a nice restaurant twice a week, and then read cards for 10 euros. I did the math. With weekends, you could make 250 euros. I've never made money out of this. I do it to help people. Right. But your fridge is empty and you've had the same coat for years. When was the last time you went to the seaside? I went once, that's what matters. Try it once. You'll still be helping people if you make money. What if I don't see anything? It happens. - Say what you feel. - And if I don't feel anything? Then give back the money. I'll have to dress up. Yes, a little. Do you have some jewels? In the meantime, I'm taking you shopping. I always put it on when I go out. Don't forget the pepper. Are you painting the kitchen blue? No, it's my sauce for the rabbit. Of course. These are my suggestions for the menu. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Please excuse me. How am I supposed to serve my venison and mushrooms, with nitrogen chestnuts, black seaweed sorbet and blue rabbit. The 28-euro fusion cuisine, I leave to you. I can't manage between charity work and my job at the bank. I woke up at 6 am to go to the retirement home. Speaking of which, how's your mum? Don't even ask. I haven't had time to see her for a month. She should be in one of the homes you visit. You'd see her more often. Very funny! I think Roger met somebody else. In Lille. Are you sure? Well, all the signs are there. I watch him falling in love. He's on a diet, he bought five new shirts, he's wearing a watch a "client" offered him. It looks like Brad Pitt's watch on TV. I've been there. The next step... - He'll start going to the gym. - Done. What are you going to do? I don't have time to think about it. Both are risky. If you throw him out, you'll be alone, like me and the girls. If you wait until he breaks up with her, he'll come back but he'll put on 30 pounds. He'll be on antidepressants with you picking up the pieces. - Hi, Ninon. - Hi! Do you want a home or a steak? Both. Make yourself at home, princess. Where does child abuse start for you? We can count bruises if you want. I know you are the social services. You bitch! I'm hungry. Didn't you get some sausage? I'm tired of sausages. Some kids don't even... I know, I know... Our teacher saw "Romeo and Juliet" in the theatre. She read us bits of it. Is Daddy home? No, he's staying in Lille. Again? It's hard work being a salesman. Later, when I'm a singer, I'll only sing love songs. Mum? Mum! What? Don't yell. Do you believe in great love? Everyone does. Does everyone have a great love? No. Not everyone. It'll be the first time in 30 years I'll be free and that's when you leave. Mum, this school is a once in a lifetime chance. It means that after a few years, I'll speak both fluent English and Chinese. With that on my resume, I'll get any job. Do you want to see pictures of the flat? It's in a very nice area of Shanghai. You'll come visit. Maybe you'll find the man of your life there. Could I be a geisha? That's in Japan. Don't you start with this too. I don't want a man. You don't want one, you want plenty. Cheers to that! - Hi, how are you? - I'm fine. The boss wanted to see you as soon as you got here. It's a good thing I'm on time. - Would you like a coffee? - No. Hi. What's with you all? Did you get fired? Isn't that... How are you? Just one minute. Hi. - Hello! - That was my third! How do I look? Is it "cool", like young people say? Maybe a tiny bit less. May I? Very nice, I'll leave you to it. Excuse me. She isn't supposed to spend hours with each client. Why is she crying? Those are tears of joy. I told her, her husband would come back this week. Coming back for good! I'm telling you, if he comes back, I'll kill myself. I understand you. Number four. Number four? That's me. If someone told me five... No, two years ago, that I'd end up unemployed and a stay-at-home dad... And that I would run away from a blue rabbit. What are your plans this summer? Don't even ask. Sandra's taking the girls at the end of August. I have to be careful with money. You know what we'll do? We'll take a break. - Take stock, see the big picture. - Right. And how would we do that? One of my aunts is broke and she has this gorgeous house. She wants to rent it. It has everything we need. Trees in the garden, a pool for the girls, corners to read in the shade. Isn't that a brilliant idea? What do you think? I think it's wonderful. What are you doing? - I'm going home to call her. - Already? Don't you want to stay for dinner? I saw what's in your fridge. I'll go home and make myself an omelette. Hi Annick, it's Christophe. Are you home? Thank you. Just go! - What difference does it make? - What do we do with her? For God's sake! Is it serious? Is it that serious? Where is she? Come in. How long have you known? It's been about a year. You lost precious time. The doctor said with treatment... Let him talk. I don't want their poison. If I have to go, I want it to be gentle. Do you understand? Do you understand? Now, I'll ask you two things. Don't hold back your sobs, you're choking. But don't ever cry like this in front of me again. Because I, I'm planning on smiling until the end. What's the second thing? There's a girl who comes see me at the restaurant, almost every week. I don't even make her pay. She'll panic if she doesn't see me there. A real little soldier. Her car is full of bin bags. And her little girl... She forgets her at the butcher's. Call me if she's still delirious. Give me her number. Time's flying, it'll soon be summer. That's what Selma always tells me. Have you known her for a long time? 30 years. Her husband was my history teacher. She's my ray of light. She won't die, will she? She will. At the hospital? No. I've rented a house for the summer, I'll take her with me. What are you doing this summer? You'll be comfortable here. Won't you? The view is so beautiful. But my bed is facing the wall. When is your friend Christophe arriving here? I've stopped waiting for men to help me... with things like this. So much for the alcove! It's the sky that matters. I can't believe we're using the chimney in July. There should be sun when Christophe and the girls get here. I looked at the cards for Christophe earlier. Emotionally, you're the same. He runs after what you lost. It's the same fear. It's not fear, I don't want to make the same mistake again. I know what's waiting for me if I go back to Bernard. We never know what's ahead of us. You have to forget about the past otherwise you can't go forward. Every day... Is a new page to write, I know. You told me a hundred times. I don't understand men. At 30 years old, when you need them, they run, and 20 years later, when you don't, they still run away. It's normal. They're scared of having it all or nothing. I have something to tell you. Frivolity at your age is suspicious. I hope you won't mind the kids. Tell me one thing, what did the doctor tell you exactly? How could he know exactly? Nathalie... He said by the end of the summer. Maybe autumn. No. That's what he said. And I say no. I want to die here, from the vines to the sky. It's not for you to decide. You'll see. Nathalie! - There's a pool! - Great! Hope you didn't forget the skis. How is she? Very well for someone who's going to die by the end of the summer. By the end of the summer? Did you tell the girls? Yes. I didn't sleep for days, but they took it very well. Tell me one thing, will she stay here until the end? Until the end! Here you go. - Isn't it beautiful? - It is! Selma asked me one thing. I know, I told the girls to be quiet. On the contrary, no catlike stealth, no soft music and no whispering, she hates it. Alright. That's for the best. I hope you brought your coats. Yes. Where's the old lady who's going to die? Here she is! - Alright, your turn. - No! There are holes in your hat. It's like me, still pretty but not on every level. I can lend you a swimsuit. It's too late for me. My heart might still be 20, but that's where it stops. That's your opinion. Joëlle arrives tomorrow. Won't it be strange? We don't know her, what's she like? She seems to be shy and stubborn, a bit lost too, her marriage is ending, she has problems with her daughter... I used to swim like Esther Williams. Have a go Madam Irma, I won't watch. Precisely. When she's stuck at work and her daughter doesn't have keys, she sends her to the butcher and forgets her there. Poor kid. And you're laughing? Come on, it's no child abuse. How do you know? - Hello. - Hi. Are these your bags? Nathalie told me you have a daughter? Yes. She preferred to stay with her girl friend. What about your husband? The same. "Give your heart Give your life If he were the one, don't be afraid of happiness Give, give, give your life Are you here with your family? Enjoy this! There are plenty like this one. Don't worry, I like kids. You live like a queen here! I know! You should see the sunset! The gold on the hill, I take it all in. You took the phone on holiday too? Are you hiding your pills? Of course! I'm not going to die surrounded by tubes and flasks. - Are you taking them? - The ones for the pain, yes. Not the ones that knock you out. I want to die with my eyes open. Come on! Come here. Let me warn you. I won't read you the cards nor use my pendulum. Why not? You don't need cards to know if you still love Roger. That's not the point... It's the point precisely. Nathalie offered you to bring Ninon... She didn't want to come! I was only asking! Drinks are ready! We're coming! They're not even waiting for me. Agathe, will you come play? - What are you doing? - Christophe! - Yes? - Where's Nathalie? She went shopping. What the hell am I doing here? She could leave her alone. Here's a gift! It's not my birthday. Well, since this is my last chance of having one... It's ridiculous! It'd suit Zoé better. I'll go change it. No way! It's my hat. It's way too small, you look like Chaplin! Can I have your old hat? Of course, here's your inheritance. You look very pretty. It's thanks to you. Shall we take a walk? I'd love to. What would you like for dinner? Well... I don't know, I like everything. Do you want me to cook? Do you cook? Well, yes... I can fix a couple of things. Mostly spaghetti. Won't it be too heavy? No, it's fine by me. As long as I don't touch a pan. Would you like some bread, honey? Are you hungry? - It's good. - I can't believe this. Everything's burnt in the pan. If we get what's on the walls and ceiling, we might have a starter. Shouldn't we put her to bed? She likes sleeping with people around. Just like when we were kids. Do you remember how nice it was to fall asleep on the living-room sofa... the loud music, all the adults talking... Lulled by the wonderful feeling that nothing bad could ever happen to you. Are you sure we shouldn't put her to bed? She likes throwing up with people around. Christophe! My friend! My wonderful friend! Could you carry me to my room? I can't do it alone. I won't manage it with dignity. I can't believe this! Joëlle, help me! The skin is really important. It's one of the few things that never changes. It's like the smell of your body... or a smile. If I understand you correctly, with Piotr... With Piotr, we made love many, many times. Getting older isn't all that bad after all. What do you mean? We learn how to take a break from it all. I can't take a break. They need me. In retirement homes, there's less staff in the summer. So this time of year, there are 20 old women outside the elevator, waiting in their wheelchair. If you pass by two hours later... they're still there waiting, or calling for help. One has her head bent forward. Just thinking about it... No! I can't take a break. Hello? Hello? Yes, I'm always here for you. Are Selma and Christophe still walking around? - What can they be talking about? - Sex! We ate all the peanuts. There's some crisps on the table. That's is a sauce that... That looks like a sauce. Champagne then? Screw you. She didn't get my drawing. She says it represents death. What did you draw? A woman with open arms at her children. Yes! - We can tell. - It's a beautiful drawing. Nathalie! Can you go? - She's calling you. - But she wants you. Right, to tell me off. She said I was a drip earlier. An idealistic drip! There's nobody more realistic than I am! If you think that waiting for a woman with Mother Teresa's soul and Angelina Jolie's body is realistic... By the way, did you tell Joëlle her pasta was good? Yes. Are you sure? I even said "delicious". Nathalie! I'm coming beautiful, I'm coming. Bravo, bravo girls! So you'd rather stay at your friend's? Yes, I told you I was tired but... Next week then? Yes. Well actually... It's because I miss you. I hear someone calling you, go on honey. Kisses. Ninon... Ninon! I take care of others and my family is leaving me. They're not leaving. They want proof of your love. You have to insist, that's what she wants. Was my pasta really that good? It could have used some garlic. Maybe a bit of sugar in the tomatoes for the acidity. I would have added some thyme too. The pasta was slightly overcooked. But apart from that, it really was delicious. Don't forget to put on the breaks to take her out of the chair. - Bye, Selma. - Thank you. Crap. Isn't he wonderful? Perfect. He's just perfect. I want to sit under the fig tree. I talked to Roger. We're going in circles. He doesn't want to lose either of us. I don't want him to cheat on me, but I'm worried he'll come back. - I miss Ninon. - Make her come here. Alright, go get my cards. We'll try to find out what Roger has in mind. Thank you. Shit! What's going on? I lost my phone. It can't be far, you had it last night. I know, that's what worries me. - I'm looking everywhere. - I can see that. Have you seen my phone? Girls, have you been playing with my phone? No, I swear! Really? You don't seem so sure. That's enough. I hate people who always suspect kids. I'm not suspecting, I'm asking. Calm down now. You won't ruin everyone's day for some stupid phone. This stupid phone holds all my contacts, numbers I don't have anywhere. That's too bad! Mister Perfect, as long as you look at me like I killed my kids, you shut your mouth! I'll go get Selma, she'll help me find it with her pendulum. Her pendulum never found anyone. I forbid you from waking her. You're on her back enough as it is. She asked me to stay and that's what annoys you. What annoys us, as you say, is you telling her your problems. We should be here for her. Because you're here for her? What would you have done without us? Without a job, a boyfriend, a daughter? I could ask you the same thing. Let me tell you, I see 45-year-old women like you all the time. What do you mean? Left behind by everyone, in the soup kitchen at 60. You're right, it's much better to be 30. To give yourself a clean conscience. Forget your daughter at the butcher's. You both made your point. Enough now. Stop acting hysterical. You should stop with the sexist remarks. It's typical of a man shitting his pants around women. Why did you say that? You made it worse. - You'd call me a coward otherwise. - I don't want her... Let her live her relationship with Selma. Selma can take care of herself. Stop trying to control everything, Nathalie! It had been a while. Sorry, I thought this was how you take care of people. When we yell at each other like that, we get told off. - What's with all the noise? - I lost my phone. Some good news at last. I guess you know some numbers by heart. I don't actually. What about Ninon, your mother, Roger? Yes, of course. Everything's fine. Well. The fridge is empty, the girls didn't eat, Selma's thirsty, and I don't control anything anymore. Excuse me, madam. The veal mignon with morels. The snail pastry. The monkfish medallion with a green pea coulis. Enjoy your meal. Gevrey-Chambertin, Les Cazetiers wine from 1996. Madam? I'm so distracted. Where are the toilets? They're this way. Don't use so much heat with the cod. Where did she go? We removed the drip this morning. She felt like skipping school. One last time. We should look at the list she read out the other day. What list? A list of all the things she'd like to do one last time. - I didn't know. - She wrote it last week. I helped her. Alright then, I'm listening. Watch "The Bridges of Madison County" again. Sleep beneath the stars and be cold in the tent. Watch Mikhail Baryshnikov dance. Rest her head on a man's shoulder. Eat nutella one last time. Pray in His house. Where's the nearest church? We could have driven you, why did you scare us like that? Look at the reflection on the river. It's beautiful. It's just water. You don't know how to look. It is beautiful. You hypocrite! What time is it? It's 8 pm. - Ninon! - When is her train arriving? 8:12 pm. It's 8:04 pm exactly. No! I can't make her wait again. No, you won't be late. Let's go girls. On your list, didn't you have "drive at 130 miles per hour down the highway"? Come on in. The new girl, how nice! Take a seat. How are they doing downstairs? They're making long faces. Well, that's quite normal for my mum. She was looking forward to seeing you, you know. Really? I think they're worried about you. They just don't get it. I'll end on a high note thanks to them. It's like in movies or in books. Do you see? The end is always the most important part. You want to be a singer? Will you sing for me? I promise! So? The druid carries some kind of bag on his back. It's not his schoolbag. It's his energy. Where's your energy then? Nathalie! Nathalie! Nathalie! A giant shit fell on Selma's shoulder! It's no shit, it's a fig. Go fetch a towel in the kitchen. Agathe, come and help me. - Are you alright? - Yes. She looks better. No, I received her test results today. It's getting worse. Smile at the little birdie! Stop it! Just go on second-hand dvd dot com. You'll find it there. Baryshnikov. Is it how you spell it? Yes, but enter the address. - This is Baryshnikov. - Yes. In "White Nights". I told you to go on this website, you'll find it there. Go ahead. - But... - What are you doing? But... Second-hand dvd dot com... Nothing. It doesn't exist. Try again. Well, try... Look at this. Isn't it beautiful? That was Baryshnikov but I've lost him. He's there. Wait, here he is. - He did 11 spins. - 11 spins! Look at him. - Is he with a dancer? - This is beautiful. I'm going. Would you be a sweetheart and bring me some fresh water? In a wine glass. You know, the pink ones. It's done! - Thank you. - Anything else, princess? - Something sweet maybe? - No. You've made him a different man. He's making progress. Something bothers me. Aren't you simpering a bit with men? "In a wine glass, you know, the pink ones." There's no simpering. It's a way to show them we couldn't live without them. They don't come up with the idea of being nice by themselves. Perhaps in the past. You should try it once. Christophe, would you be... A sweetheart. Would you be a sweetheart and bring me some water with mint? Don't you have legs? It only works if you're dying. Would you like some ice-cubes with it? Yes! Did Nathalie ask you to buy Tramadol? Yes, she had two very bad nights. She looks fine during the day. The doctor will put her on the drip again. - Would you like a coffee? - Sure. When she gets worse, I don't know if I... I'm scared of being a coward. She's also scared sometimes. I'm always scared. Who has made you happiest these past few years? You did. And when I'm gone? I'll find something. Every day is a new page to write. You should think about it beforehand. You'll never be happy by yourself. Never. No kidding! "We're nothing without love We're nothing In silk and velvet he was sleeping in nice sheets. But don't forget" I never heard anyone sing so out of tune! One, two, three, four, five, six. I already bought the Gare de Lyon. Okay. Wait, the rent... Do you need a third player? No, we're fine as we are. Wait, here. Four! One, two, three, four. That's my street. - It's no big deal. - Listen, Ninon. I might be the worse mother on earth, but if you blow me off you can go back to your friend's. Really? Can I go back? I have a ticket not to pay anything. So that's seven. One, two, three... It's a miracle that it's on TV today. I had put it on my list: Watch "The Bridges of Madison County" again. Will you cry? Every time when he hangs the necklace on the rear-view mirror. Every time! I always hope she'll open the car door. That she'll throw herself into his arms to find shelter. We don't necessarily find shelter in a man's arms. Except maybe for you and Piotr. If you think 40 years of love means 40 years of happiness... I hated Piotr as much as I loved him. We infuriated each other, as much as we loved each other. See, she should open the car door! We recover from the mistakes we've made. But what we missed out... we can't ever get over. If you're referring to Bernard, I'll turn off the TV. Now? Now, just before the scene with the necklace. Why are you all so scared of living. I'm not scared of living, I don't want to get hurt again. It's the same thing. Go with the others, I'd rather cry alone. Is Selma going to die today? I'm hungry! No. It won't be today. - Yes! - This was nice. - I don't know what it was. - My turn. - Bastard! Wait a minute. - Did you see this one? Come on! Don't play with your food. It seems everyone's having a good time! - Excuse me? - Why not, after all? It's true. We're smiling, waiting for death. Pretending this is normal. But today it's Selma and tomorrow you, me and us! No kidding! I never thought of that. Don't you think we're scared too? Do you think we sleep with a smile on our face? Why don't we ever talk about it then? Because she's old? - Life's taking its course? - Shut up. She could be 17 or 95, it's the same to me. I don't want her to die. We're just trying to accept it. I just hate that word. I'm out of here! Where are you going? Not far, where do you think? I have something for you. Baryshnikov! Thank you! It's getting chilly. Shall I take you upstairs, princess? Yes, please. - Are you practicing? - They're Selma's card. Can you teach me? Cut the deck. Give her time. After Sandra left, I had a hard time with the girls. It didn't happen just like that. Really? I thought it came naturally to you. An instinct for people who always say the right words and do the right things. Come on, you were just 17. Even at the hospital, I couldn't hold her properly. I couldn't nurse her. She always intimidated me. Tell her that. You should use it more often. - What? - Your smile. It's very cute. I can't remember the last time I danced. There's a very bad club not far from here... Really? You're a knockout! I know I am! Did you see the guy with the glasses at the bar? Wasn't he cute? You should go back, he was staring at you. Do you really want one more? - I don't know... - I know. What? I want to be in love. She didn't mention Roger, did she? - She didn't mention Roger. - No, she didn't. What are they doing now? We haven't gone shopping for a long time. Really? - Yes. - This is ugly. Not great... Let's look at glasses. Show me. No... No! No. And these? Better. I saw a shop with phones. - You could buy a new one. - A new what? I've done everything for her to have a good night. You should be prepared. It shouldn't be long now. - Which one of you is Nathalie? - I am. Follow me, please. She asked me to give you this. You should give it back once she's gone. Concerning the paperwork, are you family members? - Well, we... - Yes. Very well, thank you. Goodbye. I can't! I know what you'll say. What else could I tell you? You'll never forgive yourself if you don't see her again. Are you okay? Now she's saying: "Mummy and Daddy love you, it won't change a thing." Yes, I think... She made up her mind. She'll look for a flat for her and Ninon in September. Everything's fine then. "My little darling, once I'm gone, read this letter and pass it on to Christophe and Joëlle. I'm telling the same thing to the three of you, so I only wrote one. Sleep well. Selma." Come on in. Right on time! I need a little hug. It's hard being the only man here. "The Vines Restaurant, The Exquisite Bar." That's a city girl's fantasy, you wouldn't last a year. I went to an inn the other day, they are selling. It was pretty nice. Beautiful kitchen, very charming. What will I miss from the city? Traffic in the morning? Do you know my life's tragedy? No one ever worries about me. Except maybe Selma. Do you know what I discovered? I made my own little list. What do I really want today? Bernard came third on the list. Just after losing six pounds. Exactly. Make love to him again. Fight with him again. Cry because of him. We never know what's coming. It's time for Madam Irma to go. We're starting to talk like her. You're right. Can I have that hug or do I need to simper? What are you thinking about? What I want the most is to meet a woman who looks at me like Selma does. Do you know what I do when I'm really scared? I pretend she's already dead. I talk about her in the past tense. I think of all the incredible moments we shared together. I get lost in them. "She used to do this." "She used to say this." This little blanket of memories will keep me warm. I'm already getting used to using it. You see... you already know how to do it. I'm not worried about you. I hate old people! Careful! Selma's TV is broken. You're the only one able to fix it. We can't leave her without a TV. - Go, Daddy. - Alright, alright. Here you go. Hello! You didn't touch it, did you? Christophe! Do you picture me on my knees behind the TV? Playing with the wires? There you go, I found the problem. It's fixed! Already? - I'm good. - You should come back tomorrow. - To double-check. - That'd be better, indeed. You don't look too bad. What were you expecting? Can I ask you something? Of course. - Are you scared? - No. I will finally know. The woman for you is waiting somewhere. But look carefully. Fate quite often comes to us with its face hidden. How do you know all this, old witch? I prefer "princess". How do you know all this, princess? You can tell me, I fixed the TV. Because I looked carefully. No need to break your radio, I'll come back. I didn't know it could be like this. The vines have changed colour. I think it's normal. The summer's passing by. The apple trees will wither soon. Change is slowly taking place. My little ones. I called work and people from the associations. I'll only go back in September. That's great. I understood that I was the one who needed them. Should she still be sleeping at 11 am? What's the weather like today? Heavy and grey. Big black clouds, just the way you like them. One last lie-in... Enjoy it, it's 11 am. Aurélie is bringing your toast today. Tell her to add some nutella. I called Bernard. I'm scared but I'll give it a shot. Good. How are you girls? We're fine. I'd like to talk to you. Go get Joëlle. I'd like you to promise me something. Anything you want. Wait until we know. The day after I'm gone... I would like... I'd like you to sleep in late. Then I'd like you to have a cheerful lunch. Of course, we'll feel like laughing! It happens! Once, after a funeral, I slipped on a crisp. Shall we let Selma speak? Of course. After lunch... I want you to take a nap under the fig tree. Is that it? That's it. We promise. - Not yet. - Shall I add another garland? Yes. No! It fell! - How is it going, girls? - Fine! Will Selma come downstairs? Yes, she'll come downstairs. She'll put on a nice dress. Can you give me a garland? We recognise your style. With candles all over it, it'll look just fine. Crap, I forgot the candles. There must be some in the house. They won't all fit on this. We'll manage. We'll need three cakes to fit them all on! Sorry, that wasn't funny. We need an ambulance. Selma has lost consciousness. This is an emergency, we're at 115 Allée des Bleuets... It's for a lady here. Number 115. Thanks. They'll be 10 minutes. What's wrong with Selma? What about Nathalie's birthday? We'll celebrate her birthday. Christophe, take the candles, the champagne and the glasses. Ninon, I want to tell you something. I'll ask the neighbour to look after the girls. - We're with her. - It's after 9 pm. - I can't. - She needs us. - Visiting hours are over. - Make an exception, please. Alright, you have 15 minutes. - Promise me. - I promise. - Thank you so much. - Follow me. - We have 15 minutes. - Okay. We're here for you. Surprise! Here. Here you go. Bravo! And the candles? Candles! Wait... I thought it was better than nothing. Blow on it. - What's going on? - I don't know what happened. - Ninon? - Yes. Sing the song I taught you. Let us not think about anything The current sweeps us away On my ship Bursting from the dock Perhaps love might be on board Let us love each other tonight without dreaming About what tomorrow might bring Going with the flow No promise is made. We only speak lies when standing on the ground Your face looks sad And it makes me think of unripe fruit Far away from the sun Which gives them their warm colour Under my lip, touched by the waves and the wind I want to see it turn purple Just like when the sun is rising SUBTITLES: RED BEE FRANCE
