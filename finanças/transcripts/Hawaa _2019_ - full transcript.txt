Not even one among the people trying to kill each other here... ...has enmity with the others They don't even know each other But destiny has driven them to this dead end The reason for that is... they say one has to pay for their own sins. This is a word from the days of Tretha Yuga But someone else would keep paying for one's sins This is the steady truth of Kaliyuga Chiluveru Lavkumar. Charlie in short cut... His entire family shifted to Australia when he was 10 years old Within 10 months... [bang] his mom and dad died in an accident Leaving behind Charlie and his 7 year elder sister Chitra as orphans They had nothing other than VISAs in hand at such a small age They didn't know what to do All their kith and kin didn't help them So, at a tender age, Charlie started shoplifting, conning people, betting, credit Card business and such small crimes. Ten years passed... Chitra was married to a businessman When they were thinking everything would be happy from then on... Charlie's brother-in-law was cheated and sent to jail by his partners for money Charlie and Chitra became orphans once again. But this time... Chitra's daughter Honey was along with them Right then... he got a sure information about a match fixing in coming up Melbourne horse race Charlie had got such news earlier too. But, he never took them seriously But this time, we can see him boozing thining he has to take it up. You've guzzled so many Pitchers! Seems like you're rocking! What's the matter? You asked to come urgently? Dark horse number 7? Dark horse in horse racing is like match fixing in cricket The amount of betting that goes into Cricket world cup held once in four years is nothing before what goes into Melbourne Horce Race Cup that happens every year This two miles race course has changed the lives of many. How depends on their betting method There are many reasons to win a race The form of the horse, its weight, distance being run, it's trainers, the jockey riding it and that race course... The betting takes place on the analysis of all these But the one and only machine changing all these, is match fixing Dark Horse [horse neighs] A horse, which has no records till date... changes its game exactly 10 seconds before the course ends and bags the cup... That is the dark horse... [horse neighs] Shall we bet 3 to 4 hundred dollars? Damn! Always 300 and 400. Is that all? Not so. It needs to change. It all needs to change The we'll add 100 more and it'll be 500 round, what do you say? [spits] Ok, you say it At once, as much for me, you, Divi, sister and brother in law to get set... 100 thousand Dollars What the screw! Where do we have so much amount dude? Should the amount be right in hands? Ok, even if its in the bank. Looks like you've decided on something, say that Isn't it enough if the token is generated? Hey, to generate it, if not in hand, we should at least have it in the card! Isn't it enough if we have the card details to generate that token? What? Mithun Krishna... AK. Mikey He joined 2 years back in a bar run by gangster Bijli Bhai Being reliable, he gained confidence at Bijli and became his personal So much that he even maintains Bijli's bank accounts too Yes, its you... We have no money. But use Bijli's card and generate the token After winning it gets 5 times and comes into our pockets, simple What if we lose and it doesn't come? No way, trust me. It will come No dude, you and your 420 ideas. I neither need you or your drink, go... Hey, Mikey... Stop dude Hey, one such idea changes the life. Don't you know? Hey, how many times did I get dark horse information? Say how many times? -About two times -Did that go wrong anytime? -No -Ain't it? Luck doesn't come even once for unlucky guys like us But, this is the third time for us Shall we use this chance or let go? But, my fear is all about that Bijli fellow. If something goes wrong, our asses gets axed You know it, right? Bijli Bhai! Bad ass Bijli! Well known address in Australia for illegal works What he plans, How he does, When he does, by whom he gets that done... Never says these to anyone including his own brother Tillu If he takes up any contract, one should fix that its concretely done I keep watching this show when I'm in stress To relax...

Ok, I'll do it myself These are the 5 Million Dollars details taken from Max These are the details of what is invested in shares and lost These are... the details of the amount taken saying to get NOC from mayor And this is for your enjoyment... Giving Natasha a car and flat... Details of what you absconded without clearing All these roamed around you from six months, got tired and... Came to me. They even offered 10% commission I couldn't refuse that So, I'm giving you time of seven days So, you clear all this amount within that time and... and make sure not to have any discomfort from us... I wish so... -What? -Yes Jai Hind! I forgot something.Yes, I remembered You don't forget... Seven days Seven days... Mayor Mahalaxmi... Took an oath to stop the increasing crime syndicate in Sydney Putting check to many illegal activities, she became a target to all the criminals She came earlier than yesterday You taking care of me and me taking care of you in between us... It ended long back Why? Did you forget? To doubt even now. I've got no illegal affair like you Stop this... Anger and on me... I come just an hour late and you get so much of pain And you... Every day with Natasha. Damn! Have you ever thought of what I go through? And by the way, I'm the mayor of the city I've so much of work and not like you Still, what did I say now? No idea what... You say a lot... and the result of all these mistakes by you... -These can't go with me -But listen to me Will you stop it? This isn't right? The relation between you and me in between the four walls is broken And I don't care about this at all But, if you do any dirty thing outside -But I. -I won't leave you -You take care -Maha... Huh! I... Huh... We kidnapped your wife. If this goes to the Police... Be careful We're a very dangerous gang. Our people would always be observing you What Sir, when I gave seven days time you came within seven hours If I knew about this, I'd have asked 5% more commission -Have you seen money movie -What? -It came in some TV -Yes, I watched -But not in TV but in a theatre in India -Oh I saw just a bit -It was good -Yes, it'd be good, Director did great Not the director. That... Jayasudha... Natural actress. Super actor -Not direction or acting Bijli -Then? That beard one in it. -JD? -Yes, JD Kidnaps Jayasudha, right? That one That episode is good After watching that scene, I got an idea from that I felt that idea would clear all my problems So, you mean to kidnap even your wife? It's tension if we kidnap She's a Mayor and special Police, investigation, Government, enquiry and many problems... So... So? Want to kill I thought well Bijli. I'm the Mayor's husband for name sake. But am unable to do anything It's all debts and tensions. I'm going crazy Added when people like you come and threaten, I feel like dying And what if she dies... Her money is mine, property is mine, insurance money is mine... And if I get the Mayor seat with sympathy? Then power is mine and authority is mine But killing Mayor means... Not this 5% or 10% Bijli. If you do this, 50% of what I get is yours What do you say? -50% -Yes Don't forget Bijli, work should be done in three days -Yo Alex -Hey Bijli What's up?

What did he say and what did you not believe? He said that the doors of heaven are open and an angel has walked to earth. What? He said that the doors of heaven are open and an angel has walked to earth. I didn't believe. But I had to believe after seeing you. I didn't ask you to repeat the same in Telugu.

I forgot myself and this is your magic" "A dream making me greed like a thought in my thoughts" "Don't hide in the skies and come down to me" "Hey cloud, you are my address" "Come to me like a rain" "Hey cloud, you are my address" "Come to me like a rain" "Hey cloud, you are my address" -"Come to me like a rain" -Charlie. You are an Australian. Why did you love me instead of loving some Australian girl? What's so special about me? Huh? Come on, tell me. If you were an Australian girl, she'd have left me long back. Don't worry. I'll be with you forever. -I love you -Love you too. -I think we are getting late. -Yeah, let's go. [police siren] -Charlie! It's Police! -Police? -What's he now? -What if he sees this guy in the boot? Hell! -Charlie, what shall we do now? -I'm thinking the same. Huh! -Charlie, he's approaching... -You don't get tensed and make me tense. Will anyone be without getting tensed or giving tension in this situation? Please do something, Charlie. What? Why you're speeding? I just got this thought. It'll be tougher to escape if they catch, right? Australian Police vehicles aren't capable enough. You don't worry and I'll take care [sighs] [police siren] Shucks! Pull over the car! -What shall we do now? -I'm thinking the same. -Do something, do something. -Yes. [music from radio] [speaking in walkie talkie] -Hello officer. -You didn't hear my siren? Music was too loud, I couldn't hear. -I need to see your papers. -Papers? Papers! Papers it seems. -Just a minute, look in that dashboard. -What? Just a second. Just these, officer! -Yeah! And who's Harry? -That's my friend. Where're you guys headed? -Melbourne. -Perth. That is, first we're going to Perth, and then to Sydney from there we'll head back to Melbourne. It's just that. Isn't it? -Yes. -That's it, officer. Officer, can we go? [sighs] Let's go. You shouldn't have told him! [gasps] -Yes, officer. -I need to check your boot. -Boot? -Boot? [music muted voice] Yes, copy that! [police siren] EDI in 15 minutes, just finalizing a vehicle stop and check. It's clean, you're good to go ahead. What's it? -Isn't he in the boot? -He can hear, let's see after he leaves. -What the! Damn! -What? He should be in this. -Where did he go? -How did he escape? He should be in this, right? -How did he escape? Damn! [coughing] Have some water. Sorry, this is all because of me I'm extremely sorry. -How many times will you say? You didn't do for yourself, right? Still, why do we talk about the past? Let's look into what needs to happen. If you were an Australian girl, she'd have left me long back. Oh no! God damn! Who's this guy doing something behind the car? What do I know? Huh! Damn! Damn! I should've taken the money at least. [phone beeping] Oh damn! This battery! Urgh! My darling Natasha! Come on! Supre! [television playing] You're watching a movie? Many things are being known by watching movies these days, baby. Cheers. When are you going to divorce your wife? It's a loss for me if I give divorce. -Hmm. -Hmm. Thus, I'm killing her. -But how're you going to do that? -Let me tell you about my plan. [music muted voice] [phone ringing] -Yes, brother. -What happened? We might reach there by an hour. Call me after reaching there and killing. Alright, brother. Hey! Drive fast. [music muted voice] "The entire life is a game" "You play your own game" "Let the air flow" "Let the air flow" "Let the air flow" "Let the air flow" "Competing with yourself and defeating yourself" "Move like a tide falling and rising again" "And cross the shores" "Who would be what for the others?" "Who'd be left behind at the end?" "Spend this moment by knowing that" "No one remembers if it was right or wrong" "It's the winner who dominates all" "Competing with yourself and defeating yourself" "Brother, leave behind the fear and step forward" "The entire life is a game" "You play your own game" "The entire life is a game" You play this game "Let the air flow" "Let the air flow" "Let the air flow" [blowing whistle] Natasha! [blowing whistle] Urgh! Is it the Champaign effect? I can't control Supre! At once, remember that you are an Indian. Yes, there you go Supre. Oh! [urinating] [panting] Hey, I can't do it any more. How long should we still push this? Hey! -What? -There's a car over there. But there isn't anybody in that. That guy is urinating there. Hey, I've a super plan. By the time he's back finishing it, we can start that car and go. -Are you sure? -Yeah, Let's go. -Alright. -Yeah. It's been so long urinating in such a place. -Come... -It's a great pleasure. Get in. -Hey! -Start the vehicle... -Even I'm trying to start it. -Do it. -Where is the key? Look there. -There is no key. Hmm. Who the 'F' are you guys? Get the hell out of here, junkies. What the hell are you doing in my car? Do you know who I am? Get out of here, junkies! Huh? What're you looking at? Do you want to fight? Come on, come! Hey! [groans] Now you come! [groans] I like it! Catch him! -Catch that fellow. -Give me the key. [groans] Where is the key? That's not the key... [groans] Where is the key? [panting] My wife is the mayor, idiots. I'll see how far can you go? If I make a call, within one mile you cover...! What are you seeing rascals? Catch that fellow. -Hey, you filthy junkies! -Shut up, idiot. Push him, push. -Excuse me, washroom! -That way. Thank you. -You go and come, I'll wait. -Hmm. -Divi. -Hmm. Do you want something? -No, nothing. Just water. -Ok. [thud] [gasps] -What's wrong, dude? -I think tire got punctured. [sighs] Why did the tire got punctured at this moment? Looks like there's some gas station there, go there. Okay, brother. [tyres screeching] Bloody hell! Shucks! Damn, I thought only one tire got punctured but it's two. -Two? -Two tires got punctured. -Don't you have a spare? -We do have it. -Then give it. -But there's just one spare. Put the puncture to that second one instead of staring at my face. Okay... -You are always into food! -Where are you heading, bro? -I'm going to the bathroom, will you join? -No, you go on! -Are you done? -Yes, done. -Let's go. -Hmm. Call him dude. [muffed groans] Stop it, you... -What? -He is in petrol pump, take left... -Slow! Slow! Slow! -Yeah! Okay... -Stop it man! -Wait, I am stopping it! He'll go inside to pay and we'll take the car and leave. -Okay, done. -Be ready. Will you eat brother? Go idiot! Always into eating. Don't you have any other work? -So, you don't need? -Get lost! Rascal... Hey, Charlie! [gasps] Damn! It's Tillu. Divi, let's go quick, get in the car. Come on. Hey Charlie, stop there man! Ah! Divi, fast! Come fast. Oh no, how did you fall so, brother? [tires screeching] Hey, stop idiot. Stop! [groans] Hey, start the vehicle. Tires are removed, how can we start the vehicle? -Huh! What shall we do now? -Shall we call brother? No need. Yeah, let's ask him for his car, come on. Boss, will you give us your car for once. We'll give it back. No way! No boss, even our car is here and we'll be back again. -Go away man, F**K off! -Argh! He doesn't seem to give dude, come on. Will you give it now or die? [pistol cocking] Guns don't kill people, bullets do. -What did he do man? -Don't know, I didn't understood anything. Ah! Ah! Hey! -Ah! -Hey! [groans] [groans] Come fast... Come fast man! Come on move. Get in. [whistles] Get in man! You and your tricks. Get in! Drive! F**K off! [pistol fire] [pistol fire] Yes, you're right mate. Guns don't kill people, bullets do. [pistol reloading] [pistol fire] [tires screeching] Damn! Argh! [shouts] Who're you all idiots? You play with me? [screwdriver splashes] [groans] [knife splashes] [phone rings] Mobile: Excuse me boss... You have a text message! [groans] Karma... is a bitch! -What's this dude? -What do I know? -Maybe it's my brother. -Yes dude. -He'd have killed if he got this. -Yes, true dude. Still, why do we need this? See now, look here. Look... -I saw. -Okay... -There's nothing. -Huh? Where's it man? -F**K! Where's the material dude? -No idea dude. -It should be right here, right? -How do I know dude? I'm not asking you, it's just an expression idiot! -Damn! -Damn! -Where's it man? -It should be right here, when we took? [tires screeching] How much more time, man? They're on the move. It takes an hour to get there. Bloody Ganjas! -Damn! Go quick. -Okay, boss. Damn! -Where's he? -He got missed out. Don't you have shame? What are those wounds? Did he hit and go? He doesn't have that much. He ran away seeing us. -Then, who hit you? -Uh! Uh! Don't know. What? Don't know? That is, we don't know who he is. How did you get hit by a stranger? [sighs] You messed him without knowing and he scratched all over. Okay, move... Where are you going guys? -Both: Car is over there...? -Then what's this? A bullock cart? -Get in! -Move guys. [bird screeching] Finally, got you. Hey... Charlie... -This guy, damn! -"Where'll you escape my dear..." -"Where'll you go?" -Where did he come from again? Divi, I'm here right? He should overtake me to reach you. You don't get tensed and I'll take care. [gasps] -Charlie, gun... -To hell with the life... Argh! Damn! Why did it stop, BMW just for name sake... Argh! -Why is he not coming? -Shall I ask him to come? Is it a joke? I'm already in tension here. What? My hand is paining badly, will you please take off your hand? Thanks... -What? -Sorry for everything. I'll kill you, if you say this again. You're the best thing that happened in my life, Divi. [scoffs] I know. [tires screeching] Hey Charlie, stop it. Stop! Stop the car man! Bijili Bhai... Laddu! [pistol fire] [voice muted] Hey! He caught in the morning when I came from my flat. Nothing happened to you, right? -He shot in the leg, dude. -Damn... You can have your dirty discussions even after stopping the car. What do you say? [tires screeching] [tires screeching] -Boss. -Yes? -Ganjas are in the next line. -Oh, F**K you... [laughs] Go fast... [tires screeching] -F**K! Move, who are you all? -"Where'll you run away Ganja guys..." [car honks] "The cheaters who fell in my sight" -Stop the horn! -Move... Stop the horn man! -Move! -Who's this fellow? I don't know boss. I think, he's the one giving idea to Ganjas. How could you think so? Yep! If you know Chess, you too will think the same. -Move... -Can you just... -try talking... -Blocking the way... Move... Hey, what should I talk? He has a gun in hands can't you see? I said move... [lighter clicks] Hey, though I knew you are a cheat and even when he said no, how many times did I help you? -Did I help you or not? -You did Bhai. Then, how could you cheat me? How? Actually, I didn't think to cheat Bhai. You didn't think but it happened. He said the same story already and you're saying it again. That is what happened boss and how can we say something else? You don't talk in between, waste fellow. No... [groans] Still, you got your money... why don't you let us go, Bijili sir? Is it? [pistol loading] [gasps] What else? If you wish to listen, there's yet another interesting story Bhai. [groans] What's that, idiot? There's so much money you can't expect in that car. Take that and at least let go Divi, Bhai. Yes boss, at least her... What's that? After giving so much amount he should leave all and why only me? -Who is she? -No idea brother. We can't believe this guy. You go and check, guys. Okay brother... Come here. Money... [pistol fires] Brother! By the time one bullet is out from your gun, total magazine will be into his head. Drop it! Drop the gun! Where is the material? [shouting] [pistol fires] [pistol fire] [gasps] [groans] Hey, Charlie! Hey! [groans] [groans] You, rascal! Hey! [groans] [groans] [groans] [panting] Why did you stop? [spray hisses] [groans] Hey! [groans] -Hey! -Ah! -Charlie, are you okay? -Hey, get up! You're alright? [panting] Take it! [pistol reloads] I did a mistake and I agree. I gave your money back. Leave us now. If you say no and still follow us, your death will come hunting you this time. -What do you say? What do you say? -Hey! Go man! Go man! Go! [panting] Brother! [coughs] What brother, why did you leave him so? How can one be without excusing, when a gun is placed on the face and said sorry? Hey, though we lost at one place we got back at the other place. -What? -Money. -We don't need anything which is not ours. -What do you mean? Don't know whether one idea changes life or not! But one small mistake! Will teach great lesson for life. Still! No problem if I get a punishment for my mistake! But even to you who are mine! Uh! Uh! It's hard for the heart dude. How do we give back the money? He'd come searching for us and then we'll return both his car and money. But, he'd kill once he sees us, right? Any idiot would understand if said in a proper way. That Bijili came to kill us. Didn't he change and forgive us? Same way! Damn! What is he? [tires screeching] -Why did he die? -Who is he? The money we have with us belongs to him. And now it's ours. Here brother, your money! [car engine starts] [doorbell rings] [door latch rattles] Who is it honey? Don't know mom, someone left a bag here. -Who is it mom? -It's Charlie. [chuckles] [phone rings] I see you happy Charlie. I didn't do anything for sister till date. Though the money we gave isn't ours, brother-in-law gets a bail with that and sister feels happy. [chuckles] Yes, I'm happy. Hey, look in the front! [tires screeching] -Hey, who are you, dude? -Call me Charlie. Give your number and we'll call. You rascal! Go! What the hell? Hey you! -Come on give me the money. -Hey, give me the money all the money. -Drop the dollars in this bag. -Give me. Give me I say. -Drop the dollars I want them, come on. -Hurry up! Hurry! Hurry up! -Give me in this bag right now! -Come on! Give me, fast! Give me. [coins clinks] -What is it man? -What is this dude? Give more. Give more. You said heâ€™ll have huge money, right? What do I know man? -I thought so and what shall I do? -You bastard, always the same dialogue. At least there aren't even 10 dollars. We expected so much. Let's at least take this. Hey, next time keep it full. -To hell with the life. Else I'll kill you. What's that, man? Charlie sent the amount he lost in betting. Ashika, that way! That way! [laughs] Hey! -Hey! Ashu! -Hey! [laughs] Ashu! Hey, got you! [laughs] I got you. Hey! -Yeah! I got you! -Hey! Got you! I got you.
