Oh, fuck. Whoo! Shit. I still can't believe he fucking fought back like that. Can't believe you shot him. Hope it was worth it. Did you check? How much is it? Is it enough? - Hold on a sec, damn it. - Well, it's gotta be more than we need. - Has to be. - Maybe about 20K. Old Billy Boy's definitely snakin' from the top. I told you he had it coming. Ah... All right. We gotta get to the border tonight. When they find that body in the morning, they're gonna come looking for us. Straight to Mexico. Yeah. Straight to Mexico. Think we'll have enough for that beach house? Keep dreaming. Oh, come on. Something right on the sand. Okay, right on it. I gotta learn to surf. You got a lot to learn, buddy. You're born, you go to school, get a job, get married, and you're supposed to do one thing after the other. And in the end, you get what you want. I don't know what you want me to say, Rich. Best laid plans and all that. Well, thanks for getting me a job at the clinic. Oh, of course. You know, I know it's not big city hospital. It's not as exciting, but... it's enough to get you and Jan back on your feet. Yeah. He threw away his entire career. Took one mistake and let 'em beat him with it. Jan... All of that work for nothing. He didn't even fight it. He meant well, even if he didn't show it right. Yeah. I'm gonna start on Biology next week. I'm just waiting on the textbooks. I can't have Riley falling too far behind. It's only things, stuff. You can buy new stuff. A new house. Thank you for letting us stay here. Just a few more months. Our home is your home. Man, you really need a lawyer for this stuff, Rich. Can't afford a lawyer. What does Dad have to say about that? He sees it as a personal insult. Mm. Thanks, sis. - Hey, thanks for the beer. - Mm. Hey, Pops. Listen, I just wanted to thank you for letting us stay at your place. And I wanted to let you know that I finished the last of the papers. So... What do you want me to say, Rich? "Congratulations"? You fucked up. You act like I had a choice. What was I supposed to do? Take it to court, drag it out for years? I couldn't put my family through that. Suppose I was one of your patients? - Oh, Dad, come on! - Just suppose. Just stitch me up. There's a 50/50 chance that I'll pull through. But what do you tell me? I'd tell you to fight. Yeah. Right. But that is not always the answer, you know? Sometimes you gotta know when you've lost. I lost. Spoken like someone who is just used to being a loser. It's funny how your version of winning always has you at the front and your family somewhere else. I won't do that to mine. - And now, the piece de resistance. - Oh, my God. - Authentic vegetarian lasagna. - I'm starving. - Oh, thank you. - I got the recipe off the internet. If it mattered to you so much, why didn't you say something? I said we should have got a lawyer. Frank, it's okay. Don't worry, Riley. Your granddaddy and I used to argue all the time. Didn't we, honey? These things pass. Come here. Have something to eat. Rich, I love you, but I need to know that you're still in this, that I am not doing this on my own. Hey... Hey, you're not... You're not. You're not. Because if I am, then maybe I should be on my own. Jan. It's hot as balls out here. I wanna get to the state line by midnight. Put some money on two, all right? Hey... what are you doing? Hey, hey, hey, relax. Jesus... Fucking money everywhere. - Are you crazy? - Relax. - It's not going anywhere. - Jesus. And don't forget my beer. God! Idiot. Lookin' for something? Just checking the merchandise. Everything okay with you, bud? Yeah... bud. Hey, you one of the Granger boys? Who's asking? I... I went to school with your brother. He was a good kid. Uh, it's a shame what happened. - Pump number two. - That... that all? Yeah, you got a shitter? Out back. Oh, fuck. - Jamie! - Hey, stay there! Stay there, and flank the bastard. - What the hell are you doing? - I don't know, it was... It was a spur of the moment kinda thing. I couldn't pass it up. Please! I have a baby! Jamie, what about the cameras? Relax, they're not on. The cops are on the way! Your dumb ass didn't get anywhere near that alarm! Throw down your gun and come out! We'll tape you and the girl up, and we'll go! We'll get out of here. You'll never see us again. I give you my word. No fucking way, scumbags! All right, no more fucking around, asshole. Come out now, or I'm gonna kill this bitch. You have five seconds! - Five... - I have a baby! Please! Jamie, don't do this. - Please. I won't tell anybody. - Four! I won't tell anybody. Please, just let me go home. - Three! - Just let me go home, please. - Two! Come on, asshole. - I won't tell anybody. He's not gonna do it. You want her kid growing up without a mom? - Jamie, don't do this. - Please. One. - Jamie... - Sons of bitches! Motherfuckers! Jesus Christ, Jamie! What'd you do? I don't know. I just saw the register and the cash. - I thought we could... - I meant the girl! Goddamn! I didn't mean for it to get all fucked up. I just thought we could get the money. Just shut up! Oh, fuck. Oh, shit. Come over here. Oh, shit, I'm so sorry. Oh, I'm so sorry. - Help me up. - Oh, fuck. Okay, help me up. Oh... You know, quail season's coming. You wanna go hunting? Um, hell yeah. I mean, yes. Your dad was your age when I took him. I remember. Can I go, Mom? Please? The joys of having a former sheriff as your father. I'm sure Frank will take good care of her. Well, I can't promise she's gonna shoot straight. Unless talent skips a generation. Excuse me, I wasn't that bad. You know that. Learned from the best. That's true. Rich, it's the clinic. Alice says they need you now. And duty calls. Eat your greens, Riley. I'm dying, Jamie. I'm fuckin' dying. No, don't even say it. That bullet, it just... It just hit your leg. It's-it's... It must've hit something important. What do we do? We gotta get as far away as possible. We have until dawn until they find the store. Once that happens, they're gonna set up roadblocks, and we're fucked. You really think they'd go to all that trouble? They're gonna be looking for us. They're gonna be looking for us hard after what you did. You don't have to stay on it like that. I said I'm sorry. - Oh, I need a doctor. - Fuck. No. No, those hospital bitches will report it. I got a plan. I think that we should... we should just keep going and... Just keep driving. Just keep driving. Thanks for coming in on such short notice. Here to the rescue. Hey, hey, be careful. Just hang on, bro. Two weeks from now, we're gonna be laughing about this. ...I've ever been through. God, there was so much bleeding. So much! He... It's actually a miracle he didn't die the moment he hit the ground. We induced a coma... I'm sorry, sir. We're closed for the day. If it's an emergency, you have to head into the city. - Took like six hours. - You saved his life. Well, he was one of the lucky ones. Look, Rich, I know you don't wanna hear this, but you can still make a difference here. Uh, I gotta get going. Is that him? Yeah, that's him. Fucking brilliant, Matty! This is gonna work. I can feel it. That last line, I won't get another chance. - Just hang on, bro, you hear me? - Yeah. Just hang on. I haven't seen a house for miles. What'd you go and get Grizzly Adams for a doctor? This is perfect. Isolated, remote, no one else around. We got lucky. You did good. You did real good. Yeah. Right there. He's turning. Not longer until he falls asleep. Did you ever wonder? About? How we did. We did the best we could. We weren't perfect, but no one is. Well, tell that to your son. Sweetheart... Oh, baby, I could've done much better. Rich does not need a lecture. He needs you to listen, to be there. He knows I am. It wouldn't hurt to tell him every now and then. I listen to... Why do you always have to be right? What would you do without me? Oh, I can't even remember where my socks are without you. - Oh, please. - Baby... - I love you. - I can't live without you. Hey. Yeah? I've been thinking about everything. We're talking about it. Look, we only have to stay here until the end of summer. And we'll put some money away. I'll open my own practice. And I'll fix this, I promise. But you and Riley... mean the world to me. It's time. All right. We're gonna do this one clean. Just tie 'em up, that's it. You got it? Hey. No killing. Yeah, well, what if they run? Then you knock 'em down. You got it? Hey! Hey, I wanna hear you say it. No fucking killing. I got you, bro. Oh, shit. Was that...? Stay here. Matty! Hey, Matty! Matty, help! Matty! Help me, Matt! Matty, help! Matty! No. I'm sorry. Jamie... What'd I fucking tell you? What'd I tell you? Dad? I swear, it was a fucking accident. No. It was not a fucking accident. She just fucking walked in the back, and I reacted. I... I didn't mean to. It's okay. I swear. Please. Oh, shit, the doc. - Guys are breaking in. - What? The line's dead. Riley! Jan, Jan, stay... Jan. - Riley. - Mom. Baby, you gotta run, okay? Don't ask any questions. We just have to... Mom! Mom! Get out of my house. My brother already has your wife and kid. I won't hurt 'em. I give you my word. But you pull that trigger, there's no guarantee what my brother might do. Good choice. That's all of 'em. Phones have shit reception. But I grabbed these just in case. Do it. I don't wanna take any chances. Bring me the doc. No, leave him alone! Mom, are we gonna be okay? Where's Grandma? It's gonna be okay. Where's my mom? It was an accident. No. No... We're not here to hurt anyone. And we're not gonna steal anything. Then why? I'm bleeding to death, and I need somebody to plug this leak, and you're a doctor. Not that kind of a doctor. Meaning what? I haven't seen the inside of a leg in ten years. I can't help you. You're a lying piece of shit. I heard you at the clinic. He was talking about stitches and swelling and surgery. You know what you're doing. I don't operate on legs. You're gonna have to find someone else. There's no time. Whatever you were before, tonight you're a leg surgeon, Doc. I'll need equipment. Um, like what? A knife? A scalpel. Uh, I'm gonna need clamps, a suturing kit. Where can we get 'em? Back at the clinic. What the fuck did you just say? We're not going back there. It's the only way. Jamie. Yeah, Matty. Bring me his wife. Wait! There might be a box of tools in a box. Uh, just old college tools in one of the barns. Let me go check. You know, I don't know if you're lying or not, and I don't really care, but if you're playing some kinda trick, and I die, you're gonna be stuck on this farm with my brother... and he already killed Grandma. What do you think he's gonna do to the rest of you? And you brought him here. Jamie... get him out of here. You don't have to be afraid. I'm not gonna hurt you. It was all a mistake before. Mistake? I never wanted to hurt anyone. Without your son, I'm gonna die. I've been with scum like you my whole life. You're all the same. No. You got us all wrong. Trust me. It's in one of those. We get what we came for, and we're gone. We used to live in a house like this. Wasn't this big, though. It was just us and Dad. I coulda left. Coulda gone to college. But I stayed. I was always there for him. You find it yet? Give me a minute. Faster, Doc. I killed a guy, you know. What are you yapping about? You asked me why I was on this farm. There was a car accident. Guy came in. I cut when I should've stitched or stitched when I should've cut. I don't even know. His family sued in civil court, and I lost everything. Yeah? Just remember... you fuck up with my brother, and it's gonna cost you a lot more than a lawsuit. Now let's fucking go! No. Just stop. - Please, don't. - Uh-huh. You know, I could've fought it. I probably would've won. The truth... is that they were right. I fucked up. I deserved to lose. No one understands. Wife doesn't understand, but I do. Now here I am, working at a clinic. Routine stuff nowadays, just basic. They don't even trust me with the kids. They don't trust me with anything. You really sure that you want me operating on your brother? No, I'm not. But I guess we're both fucking unlucky tonight. You done? Good fucking boy. Now let's go. Let's fucking go. - Ah, shit. - What the fuck? He didn't mean it. He'll be good. Then we just get out of here. Everything will be okay. We just need to get to the border. Let's just... Let's get to the border. Get up! Grab the shit! Uh-huh. Fuck... I think someone's coming. - Oh, Matty. - Dad. Jan, Riley, Dad, you okay? Hey. How you doing? It's gonna be all right. We got the stuff. Don't do anything else they say. You understand? Okay. I'm gonna get us out of this, okay? Listen, we have to take control. I've seen how these things end. No, you don't worry about them. Just get better. I'll take care of it. No killing. No killing. You just rest easy, bro. You're operating, Doc. Now! I'll get us out of this. Now, I'm gonna need some help. Would you grab my wife? Not a chance. When I start cutting into your brother, you're gonna have to hold him down as hard as you can. So as I said, my wife. You're a doctor, right? You swore an oath? You have to help my brother. If he dies... that's against your oath, right? Fine. Your wife. You... Looks like you're up, old man. Oh. You're a tough son of a bitch, huh? Used to be the big dog in town. Yeah. Bet you got a hard-on for me after I killed your wife. Sure you'd like to dance with me if I gave you the chance. Just give me five minutes alone. Take your fucking head off. Oh! Yeah? Yeah? Yeah, that's what I fucking thought. I'm gonna untie you now, and you better fucking behave, you hear me? Better fucking behave. Just walk. Listen, I don't have any fucking cuffs for you. Don't try anything. Take it easy. If my brother dies, I'm gonna kill you. I'm gonna kill your daughter, I'm gonna kill your wife, and I'm gonna kill your fucking dad. All right. When I start cutting, bite on this. I need you to hold him down as best as you can. - Got it? - Yeah. Okay. Dad, grab his ankles. - On three. - Okay. All right. One... two. Hey, hey, hey! Hey, you're fucking killing him! Hey! - Hold him. - Fuck! Hold him. It's okay. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. It's okay... Doing fine. All right. Okay. It's the femoral artery. I got it, I got it. - Ah, yes. - Fuck. Oh, fuck. It's all right. Hey, come on. Grab his foot, hold on. Concentrate. - Okay, fuck. - Got it? Okay! Fuck! All right. It's gonna be all right. It's all right. Hang on, hang on. All right. All right, we got it. The bleeding's stopped. We're good? Nah, I still gotta sew him up. Clamp's just holding him together for now. He'll die like this. Oh, fuck. I told you. Oh, fuck. Shit! Kill my wife? Dad! Riley, try to untie me. Rich, are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Can you get free? We're working on it. Riley? Good job, baby. - Rich. - The phone. Oh, no. Drop it... or I'll kill him. Drop it. You're finishing the operation! Stay still. Hey! - Mom? - Yeah, Riley? Are you okay? Did he hurt you? No. Oh... Dad! Rich, where's Frank? Come on. He went to go get help. Look, I want you to take Riley, I want you to get out to the back shed. Lock yourselves in. Do not come out. Oh, I know Dad's got a gun somewhere else on this farm. I'm gonna go find it and draw that bastard out. - What if he... - Hey, hey, hey. Lock yourselves in. Do not come out no matter what. Hear me? I'm gonna come for you. I promise. All right, go, go, go. Go, go, go now. Oh, fuck, Matty. Hey, hey, Matty. Hey. Can you please wake up, huh? Please. I need you, brother. I need you. - Uh, Jamie... - Hey! Hey. Did... did it work? No? - Oh, fuck. - Oh, my... No. I counted to three. I'm so sorry. The doc, he, uh... He got the best of me. They're-they're all gone, I... No, hey, no, no. Don't, don't. Stop, stop. Don't. Hey, don't, don't. Don't, don't. Hey, hey. I will make this right, okay? - Yeah? You just rest. - Yeah. Okay, I'll take care of it. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look at me, look at me. Going to Mexico, okay? The beach house, remember? - Yeah. - Yeah. We're going no matter what. No matter what. No matter what. Jamie. Yeah, yeah, what? Tell me. What is it? No more killing. I'm not gonna let you die. I promise you. I promise. - Okay. - Okay? Yeah. We got this. We did the best we could. Rachel. Stay with me, stay with me. Okay, come over here. Oof... Okay. Oh, my God. What were you thinking? You shot the doc? It wasn't that bad. Just clipped him in the shoulder. Oh, Jesus Christ, Jamie. Just... just tell me what to do, Matty. Tell me how to make it right. Leg up. Come on. - I got it. - No, no, no. Here, here, got it. Easy, easy. Down right here. Right here, right here. Hey, hey. Hey. Can't... I... You cannot die. Do you understand me? It hurts like hell, right? Right, you can do this. Do you hear me? - Okay. - Just tell me how to fix you. - Come on. - Okay. What do I do? Nah, nah, nah, nah, no. Come on, stay with me. I need to, uh... Need to get this shirt off... - You should lift the shirt off. - Okay. Ah! Just... just stop! Stop, stop, stop, stop! - Jesus, stop. - All right. Okay. Some peroxide, a sewing kit. Talc and a mirror. - All right. - Oh, my... - Okay. Cut the shirt off. - All right. All right. Oh, oh. All right, all right, be done in a minute. I'll be done in a minute. Here we go. All right. Okay. Now what? Gimme the mirror, I need the mirror. Here. Gimme that. All right, what? Just tell me what to do. Gimme the mirror. Gimme the mirror. All right, and...? Peroxide? Yes? I got an exit wound. I gotta sew it up. Peroxide, peroxide, peroxide, go. - All right, all right. - Thread a needle. All right. All right, what do I do? - All right, gimme the needle. - All right, you got it? Hold the mirror. Hold the mirror. - Okay. - Yes? Steady, steady. Okay. All right, all right. Christ. Oh, fuck. What are you doing? Maybe just... I could just finish or... No, Jamie. The doc, he was... He said he was almost done, so maybe I could... There's not enough time. I can barely move. Come here. It's okay. It's all gonna be okay. Okay. Oh. Stay warm. Thanks, Pops. I always wondered what it felt like. All right. What do you need, Matty? - Oh, right. - Hey. Jamie... God, fuck. Jamie, Jamie. I'm gonna go find the doc. His wife, his kid. That'll make him come out of hiding. It has to. - It's over. It's over. - No. Listen to me. Listen. Take the money. Take the money and leave. Take-take the car, the money, and go to the border. Okay? You'll be safe. - What did I tell you? - What? I'm not leaving. I'm never gonna leave you. Jamie... I'm gonna make this right. I'm gonna make this right. No, Jamie. You just hold on. You just hold on. Oh, Jamie. Rich. Hey. Hey, man, Rich. Wake up. Doc? I know you're in there. Come on, Doc. You fuck-up. You're making this harder than it has to be. Don't, don't. I'm not gonna fight him. You were right. I put myself first. I want you to know that I was always proud of you. Always. Okay? So proud. So smart. So much smarter than I ever was. Sorry I was such a hard-ass bastard. Dad... You raise that kid right. Do a better job with her than I did with you. Dad... What are you gonna do? I'm gonna get his attention. Thanks, Pop. Come on! Yeah, come on! Fucker, huh? Come on! Fucking get you! Ah, Christ! Come on! Fuck. Don't move. - Mom, I'm scared. - I know. Baby, go around that corner. Okay, don't make a sound. Rich? Is that you? Jan? Jan. Riley... Riley, she okay? - She's okay. - She okay? Okay. I love you, Jan. I'm sorry. - I love you. - Oh. I swear, I'm gonna get us out of here, okay? I will. Oh, babe. No matter what happens, I love you. Okay. I'm gonna get us out of here. I'm gonna get us out of here, okay? You got my word. Rich! Rich. Rich. - Wake up. - Shit! Jan? You're finishing the surgery. Do you hear me? Jamie. Jamie. Come. Jamie. Oh, Jamie, why... why didn't you leave? Oh, Jamie, why didn't you leave? I told you. I'm never gonna leave you. I'm never gonna leave you. Never. - Leave. - No. No. We're going to Mexico together, remember? Like you said. We're getting a house on the beach, and I'm gonna learn to surf, too. - That was... - Yeah, you promised. - You promised me, Matty. - Oh, Jesus, just leave. - Leave, leave. - No, you just don't worry. I'm-I'm gonna fix this. We should've never come here. Should've never come. I shouldn't have let you kill that girl. I shouldn't... Don't worry, Matty. Don't worry. It's gonna be all right. The doc is gonna fix you up. You'll see. Jamie. Yeah, Matty. Drag the wife out of the room. Yeah. Yeah, whatever you want. And get the doc, so we can get this over with. - No, no, no! - Jan! - Don't touch her! Jan! - Rich! You got one more operation, Doc. Come on. - What are my odds? - Uh, honestly, if I operate without blood transfusions, I... I don't know what your blood pressure is, but it's not looking good. He'll live. You understand? Let's get it over with, Doc. Ahem. Jamie... Come on, come on. Come on, come on. Hey, Matty? Matty? - Matty, Matty. Matty, Matty... - Shit, shit, shit, shit. - Come on! - Shh. Breathe. Breathe! Come on, man! Come on! You got this. Get up! - Come on. - Stand up! Do something! Help him. Come on! - Come on! - No! Please, God. I'm sorry. You're sorry? You're sorry?! You fucking... You're sorry? Come on, come on, just take it easy. Take it easy, come on. Get out of here now. But Rich. Jan, wait. Motherfucker! His chances were never that good anyway. Take it easy. Fuck you! Fucker... Goddamn it. Fuck! - Fuck! - Jan, run! Go! Hey! Going to Mexico, okay? The beach house, remember? Yeah. We're going, no matter what. No matter what. This is for my mom. Riley! - Mom? - Riley! Rich. Oh, Jan. Mom! Dad! Hey, baby girl. Oh.
