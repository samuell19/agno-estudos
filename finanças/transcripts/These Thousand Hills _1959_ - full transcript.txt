That's what the fella in jail said. How do you think all those big ranches got started? Honest? - How did they? - By stealing horses. Yeah, a fella down in Gold Creek once showed me how. All you need is a jackknife or a hot iron, and you just change the brand. There must be a way to get rich without stealing. That's what the fella in the poorhouse said. Come on, Lat. It's your watch. - What time is it? - Midnight. Won't be long now. Good-bye, cows. Hello, Fort Brock. "What's yours?" they'll ask. And I'll say, "Light, dark or a redhead." Did you ever hunt wolves? - Why? - I was listening to Chico talk. He made a thousand dollars in one winter, just out of wolf hides. That's a hard way to make a living. Is there an easy way? I ain't afraid of hard work. I just don't want to die poor. You lived poor, is that it? My old man owned a ranch along the Willamette. Went broke. Hard times. That's all I remember. I don't want to end up like he did. A failure, hiding behind the Bible, pretending money isn't important. - Hate the old man? - Naw, I... Pa just couldn't look a fact in the face. That's all. Me, I'm different. I'm gonna get me a ranch... and I'm gonna make it work, no matter what. How about it, Tom? Just one winter huntin' wolves... and we'll have more and quicker money than six months on the trail. You kill a buffalo, then you poison the meat with strychnine. Then you wait till the wolf that feeds on it dies of the cramps. Mm-mmm. It's quick money, kid, but it's dirtier. - What's dirty about it? - Not me. I ain't gonna spend a winter freezing my tail.

We wasn't doing anything— Just— just kissing maybe. There stood Pa in the doorway. And there was this buggy whip up on the wall. Well— I— I didn't mind for myself so much, but... h-he kept whipping her too. And she was crying and dodging around. Now, every time there's a girl— any girl— I...

Sit down. Rest that hat. What can I do for you, Evans? Well, I don't have a job right now and— and I'm out of money... and a bank loans money, doesn't it? That's right. A bank loans money. There's also work for anybody who's out of it. Well, uh, I'm not after a job, Mr. Conrad. - What are you after? - Ranching. Sheep or cattle? - Cattle. - Hmm. - They call sheep the golden hoof. - I like cattle. - Have you got a ranch in mind? - Yep. Along the Tansy River. It's good high grass, and high grass is fat grass. Could I see you for a moment, Uncle? Oh, excuse me. I... Not just now, honey. In a few minutes. I'll wait outside. I don't want to keep you from anything important. It's all right. She's my niece. You know, Evans, a bank isn't a racetrack. We can't afford to back gamblers. Well, why not? You gamble all the time, don't you... on weather and grass and— and the price of cattle? I'm asking for a loan as a start on something solid. - As a stake. - I'm sorry, Evans. It's too much of a risk. You get yourself some security— A piece of land... a deed, something to put up— Then we'll talk about a loan. Meanwhile, I will be very glad to back any horse you race. Thanks. For nothin'. - Is my uncle free now? - Free? There ain't nothing free in this bank. Lat? - Can I get you a cup of coffee? - No. What's the matter? Nothing's the matter. I've been drinking. I went to the bank to ask for a loan... for a stake on a ranch... but they don't loan you money at a bank unless you got money. So I've been drinkin'.

But what if I go broke like my old man? Not you, Lat. Maybe I'm just doing it to keep you with me. ♪♪ ♪♪ Well, there it is, Mr. Conrad. It's good fat grass, just like I said. And I'm gonna put it all under fence. Fence? Why, there'll be free grazing land in Montana longer than you'll ever live. That's what they said in Eastern Oregon a while back. You know, people say that cattle do fine here. They say that natural pasture is enough, even in the winter. But it isn't. Because cows get poor in the winter. And too many of 'em die off. And the calves are born spindly. And the beef weighs less. And someday, who knows, we may even have a cold stretch here like you never saw. And then come springtime, all them cows will be dead that you lent money on. - Go on. - Well, my idea is... I'm gonna grow hay here, and I'll store it up in my barn during the summer months... and come winter, I'll hand-feed it to my cattle. Fences, hay and homestead. - In Montana? - That's what I see coming. $2,000 won't buy many cows. Be enough to get me started, and that's all I need. The bank will match whatever you've paid for the land. Thanks. A straight business proposition. Interest, one percent a month. That rate makes figuring easy. Well, you're never gonna regret this, Mr. Conrad. Oh, one point. I make it as an older man. You can take it or leave it. Too many young fellas start out ambitious. Somewhere they leave that ambition in a saloon... or a fancy boudoir. Evans is a good name back home. I'm out to make it mean something here. Fine. Did you get what you wanted this time, Mr. Evans? Yes, Miss Joyce. "For every beast of the forest is mine... and the cattle upon a thousand hills." Why not? Come into the bank. We'll draw up the papers. Hiya. Yippee! We're in business, boy! - Meaning what? - The loan, you mutton-head! We got the money for the cows! - Whoo-hoo! - Well, I'll be. Yeah, but, Lat, I got nothin' to put in the pot. - The chips is all yours. - Eh, we're partners, ain't we? What do I have to do, knock that into your thick skull? Whoo! You and me's runnin' this ranch together. And maybe we'll have Whitey and Carmichael workin' with us too... if they want jobs. Ain't nobody ever wanted me for a partner before. Ahh. Well, like I said, you'd live to die rich, didn't I? Didn't I, huh? Come and get it! Come and get it! There ain't much! - Dressed for a buryin'? - No, dinner. - In town? - I ain't gonna eat it out in the brush. - Where's Tom? - He rode in last night to see Jen. - Whiskey's gone. - I'll get you a bottle. Whitey, I think you'd better take a look at the cows in the south pasture. They might drift into the fence. You know, it's a wonder to me a cow ever lived till you got here. A lot of 'em didn't. Well, Mr. Evans. - And dressed fancy. - Hello, Jehu. - Party somewhere? - At the hotel. I'm invited to dinner by the Conrads. I hear the winter busted nearly everybody but you, Evans. - Did it? - Half my herd's gone. And I got horses missing. - Stolen? - Looks like it. If you're thinkin' of sellin' what's left of your herd, I'm lookin' for some more head. Ain't that pressin' your luck, Evans? It's either me or the auctioneer. Besides, you said once my luck wouldn't last. Maybe we both ain't waited long enough to tell. See me after roundup. I might listen to your price. - Hello, Mr. Strain. - Oh, hello, Mr. Evans. - I got some mail for you. - Good. - There you are. - Thank you. - A bottle of whiskey. - Mm-hmm. - Cash. - Your credit's good. Not for whiskey. - Howdy, Lat. Mr. Strain. - Hello, Tom. - Tom. - Can I have a couple of scoops of flour? - You bet ya. - Taking up baking, Tom? Not me. Callie. Yeah, she's baking you a cake. Oh, Lat, uh, what time will I tell Callie you'll be over? Tonight, after supper. Here you are. Two bits. - Thank you. - Thank you. Oh, Lat, there's something else I got to tell you. - Yeah? - Yeah. Well, you see, we want you should stand up with us. - What? - Well, you and Callie, that is. - Stand up? - Yeah. Well, Jen and me, we're gonna get hitched. You to her? Well, she says I'm good enough. - Tom. - We're gonna make it proper. If old Brother Vaughn's in town, we're gonna have him tie the knot. Oh, I know I ain't got nothin', exceptin' our partnership. And— And Jen— well, she ain't never saved a dime, but... Well, I figure between us... Well, we got each other, and— and that's a pretty good hand to draw to. And what she's been? Well, I ain't so pure myself. Neither are you. Neither is nobody. Now, I asked you a question, Lat. You gonna stand up with us? We'd like it the best in the world. Tom, she's a tramp. Wife or not, she'll always be known as that. Well, uh— Pious, ain't you, huh? A hunk of land, a banker's hello and nobody's respectable enough for you, huh? Well, whose money got you started?

Very well. - A penny for your thoughts. - There. Oh. Two bits in this country. - Two bits? - A quarter. Oh. Are your thoughts worth a whole quarter? I was just thinking how my pa used to say grace. - At home? - Yeah. I'm holding a service tonight, Brother Evans. New faces delight the Lord. Well, uh, I was reared in the church. - Praise be. And you see that he don't backslide, sister. I wish I could talk to a jury the way Brother Vaughn hammers at us sinners. Three things a town needs: a good preacher... a good lawyer and a good school. We've got two. In order to have a good school, you have to have a board. I'd like to see you serve on that school board, Lat. - Me? - You, my son. Well, uh, I'm not much educated. "Much" is a relative word. Anybody smart enough to triple his herd as quick as you have is educated enough. Think it over. But I'll tell you one thing: A man starts in with property... then if he's the right man, he serves on the school board. And after that, who knows? I've known some me to go on to the state legislature and even further. Lat? You gonna ask a gentleman in for a drink? The house is fresh out of liquor. - If it's Evans you're expectin', don't. - Why? Well, they serve mighty long dinners over at the Conrads'. Besides, she's a pretty girl, that Miss Joyce. Tidy, educated. Been to college and all that. Looks like I'm the only one with a real sweet tooth tonight. You know how it is. When a man ain't had somethin' sweet for a long time... he gets to cravin' it. - Particular with your kisses? - I am tonight. Oh, stop it. Let me go! With my compliments. - Two bits for your thoughts. - Hmm? Oh. Well, I was thinking of buyin' some more cows. Oh. After this winter, a lot of men'll have to sell if they can. It doesn't seem fair. I don't make the weather, Joyce. Don't hold it against me for being prepared. Oh, Lat, I don't hold anything against you. Maybe I got a right to sit pretty. You don't sit long enough to be pretty. - So I'm ugly? - As a mud fence. I happen to like mud fences. Well, here we are— home. Good night, Lat. When am I gonna see you again? Mmm? - It depends. - On what? Oh, on your reputation. You know, I don't know very much about you. What would you like to know? Oh, well, for instance, um, do you gamble at cards? All the time. And use the Lord's name in vain? - Often. - And break the Sabbath? Cows don't know when it's Sunday. Well, when you're on the school board, you'll have to educate your cows. It was a lovely evening, Lat. I'll be home whenever you call. Callie? Callie? Lat! Lat! Lat! Hey! What's the matter? Can't I be happy to see you? Not so happy you cry. I'm sorry I'm late. I... I was invited to dinner by Mr. Conrad. Who was there? Conrad and his niece... and Link Gorham, the lawyer... and Brother Vaughn. You liked that, didn't you? I guess so. Yeah. Yes, I did. But there are a lot of things I don't like, Callie. Like what? Like... the way things are. The- The way I am. - For comin' here? - I wanted to see you, or I wouldn't have come. But to come here from dinner with all those important people. Mr. Conrad thinks I ought to run for office someday. He thinks I ought to start with the school board maybe. Are you goin' to? I told them I'd think about it. You'll be a good one. I don't know about that. But I... I wanted to tell you. You're the one that's on the way up, Lat. I owe my start to you. But you gotta finish by yourself. That's what you're tryin' to tell me, isn't it, Lat? If I could only do something for you. Oh, there's nothing you can do for me. What you want is a starched wife and a starched home... and a starched reputation, and I'm spoiling your chances of getting it. You just keep on being nice to bankers and their nieces, and you'll get what you want. - Stop it! - Stop what? There's nothing to stop. Everything goes on till it ends. That's all. Maybe you're right. Maybe that is what I want. I never lied to you, Callie. But I'll always be grateful. Men and their gratitude! Don't you worry about me! You just keep climbing, and you'll get there! - The only place you and I ever got was right— - Don't... That bother you?

You missin' any? - I watch my stock close. - Sure. Any idea who's doin' the rustlin'? We know one thing: They're cabined up north in the breaks. - We're gonna jump 'em. - When? Dawn. That's why we're here. We're lookin' for you to come along. Up there in the breaks, huh? What makes you so sure they're guilty? There are no innocent men in the breaks. - I don't like it, Frank. - Why? You'll be gunnin' for everything in sight. - That stick in your craw? - A little. What do you want, Evans, a vote from the Bible class? Easy, Jehu. Lat knows all we're doin' is protectin' our property. That's his side of the fence too. And he ain't big enough yet to go it alone. It's our horses now. Tomorrow it'll be yours. All I'm saying is wait. - For what? - Evidence. And then let Sheriff Slade handle it. Slade says the breaks are over the line— Out of his jurisdiction. Did they wait for the sheriff over at Gold Creek? They shot 'em up. "Vigilante" is just a polite name for "murderer," Jehu. You know, Lat, Jehu, me, other ranchers... we swing a lot of votes in this territory. Now, wait a minute. I'll tell you what. I'll make you a promise. We ride out to the breaks... No shootin' unless they shoot first... And when we're sure, we'll bring 'em in for Slade to throw into the lockup. - Fair enough? - Who you speakin' for? Brice Walker, McLean, the Swede, all of us that's goin'. - All right. I'm in. - I knew you'd see it our way, Evans. We're only doin' what a man's got to do to protect his own. Ride over to my place before dawn. Lat, what is it? It's nothing. A little trouble over at Chenault's place. I have to ride over there before dawn. Oh. You're pretty any hour of the day. Do you know that? Oh, Lat. You're so thin. You work too hard. You haven't an ounce of flesh on your bones. ♪ Work, for the night is comin' ♪ ♪ Rest comes sure and soon ♪♪ Not that kind. What about this kind? You thinking? I was just thinkin' about somethin' my pa used to read from the Bible. "A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband." What part of the Bible is that from? From Proverbs. Lat? Are you asleep? Cabin's ahead, to the right. We'll go up on foot. Ride closer, and a horse'll whinny. - How does the cabin set? - Facing us— south. One door in front, and no place else for 'em to make a break. Leave Gunderson with the horses. - But I shoot good. - Stay with the horses. Here's a spot for you to angle off. Be careful, Lat. Now, come on outta there! No more! Don't shoot! We come out! No! No, no, no, no! Mon dieu! No, have pity, huh? Have pity! Save your prayers! You'll need 'em in hell! - Tom! - You're all here, huh? Includin' the senator. All the groundhogs, the water hogs and the natural-born hogs. Talk big or go beggin' like your friend. We got a cure for both. Anyone in there? Yeah, Bigsbee, shot through the face. McLean, have a look. Saves hangin'. Now, Mac, look inside. Give me that rope. Make it good, Jehu. I don't wanna hang on the wrong knot. Tie his hands. Wait a minute! Wait a minute! You gave a promise, Frank— no hangin'. We're takin' him to the sheriff if he's guilty. - If? - Let's hear what he's got to say. - We know he's guilty. - Shut up! Tom, what about them horses in the corral? Well, they got four legs, ain't they, Senator? - They're stolen. - We're givin' you a chance, Ping. - Talk up if you're innocent. - Innocent? Well, that depends on who the jury is. I'll tell you a couple of things I ain't guilty of. I ain't prayed on Sunday. Bought cows cheap on Monday. I ain't broke my word. I ain't climbed up high on somebody else's back... or thought of myself better than another man. I ain't double-crossed a friend or made a little tin god out of money. Sure, I'm innocent. I'm as innocent as you. Or ain't you boys innocent? Like he says. It's Bigsbee... shot through the face, and the cabin's full of branding irons. Are you satisfied now? Here. Throw this rope over that branch. Bring up a horse. Guilty or not, you ain't hangin' him, Jehu. The agreement was we take him in for the sheriff... and he stands trial, and that's the way it's gonna be! - You takin' him in, Senator? - That's right. - Brice. - Yeah? Cover Evans. You never intended to take him in, did you, Jehu? We're cleaning out these hills once and for all. You comin' along guarantees you won't open your mouth to the law. Move. Brice, I'm afraid you're gonna have to use that gun. Now, Lat, he told us himself them broncs were stolen. He's entitled to a trial. That's what the law says. Hey, Lat. Hey! Neck's broke. Let's get out of here. I'll go on into town. You sure you're gonna be all right? - Yeah. - There ain't no need to go blamin' yourself. No, it's just like Tom said: "Plowboy to rancher and rancher to president." Maybe I'll make it yet. Lat, I waited all day. At Chenault's they said you'd ridden off into the hills. Frank's wife said she thought you'd gone hunting. That's right. We— We went hunting. When I came back, there was a note for you under the door. Who is Callie? She's a... girl I used to know. Well, the note says she needs you. - Isn't that what it says? - Yeah. Well, is she accustomed to sending you notes when she's in trouble? - She has a right to. - The right? Were you in love with her? What's past is past. Oh, of course. - When did you meet her? - When I first came to Fort Brock. - Not at a church social, I imagine. - No, not at a church social. Oh, you were lonesome. A lonesome cowboy, and she was kind to you. - More than that. - More? Five years ago, she lent me the money she had saved up to get this ranch started. I see. Then I'm indebted to her, too, aren't I? For everything? L at, if you go into town and see her... I won't be here when you get back. Now, Joyce, I love you. What's past is past. But I've been takin' a good long look at myself today... and I don't like what I've seen. I don't like what I've become. That's why I have to go into town. You still love her. You know I don't. But I owe Callie somethin'. I owe her the right to call on me when she needs help. Oh, how can I believe you? Why should you want to see her now if you haven't been seeing her? How do I know there haven't been other notes on other occasions? You'll just have to believe me. Come in, Mr. Lat. I've been waiting. - Where is she? - Upstairs. She didn't write that note, Mr. Lat. I wrote it. - You? - She ain't got nobody else but you to turn to, Mr. Lat. She's got Jehu. I'm out other life now. Mr.Jehu— He's just trash. He come here early this afternoon, and he was feelin' ugly. Him and Miss Callie was in the parlor here, drinkin'. She's been drinkin' bad, Miss Callie. Won't stop for nobody. I was outside on the back steps just gettin' a little air... when I heard Mr.Jehu cursin'... so I run in, and he's beatin' her. She's up there with the door closed, and she won't come down. She ain't made a sound up there. Ain't nothin' to blame anybody for. Just maybe it would be better if she left this town... 'cause it ain't brought her nothin' but bad luck. Callie? Callie, I wanna talk to you. You didn't have to come all the way down here to get my vote. Don't worry. I'll vote for you come election day. Happy said that Jehu hit you. Sure he did. Why not? Callie, open the door. He said they— They hung Tom Ping. - Did they? - Yes. - Were you there? - Yes. - And I said Jehu was a liar. - Callie... - He didn't like being called a liar. - Callie, open the door! Callie! - Where you goin'? - To find Jehu. Don't. You don't owe me anything. You paid off the loan. Lat, what happens to me doesn't matter. After Jehu, it'll be some other man. I'm not worth risking anything for. Go home where you belong. No, Callie. I... I can't go home yet. Evenin', Lat. - Reckon we're gonna have some rain? - Maybe. They tell me up in Helena they got the streets all paved. - Is that right? - That's what they say. Got an opry house, too, and gaslights. Sure gonna be a different life for you and the missus. You'll be up there with the high and the mighty. I'll never forget the first time you rode into Fort Brock. You and that fella from Texas. What was his name? - Butler. - Yeah, Butler. Yeah. - And all you owned was a horse. - That's right. Well, a fella has to make up his mind what he wants... and just go right out and get it. That's all that counts— Gettin' there. That's what folks in this town admire you for, Lat. You got there. So I'm a success. Is that it, George? That's it. People don't go around admirin' failures. There's too many of 'em. And don't you worry none about my vote. It's as good as cast and in the ballot box. Night, Lat. Good night, George. - Where you going? - In there. - I have something to settle with Jehu. - Don't be a fool. Joyce is at my place with the boy. Come home with me. That woman isn't worth whatever you're thinking of doing. - Isn't she? - No woman other kind is. It's hopeless to think you can do anything for her. You'll only be ruining your own life. If she's in trouble, give her some money. Money? That fixes everything, doesn't it? You're a man with a future... but if you go in there, your political chances are finished. All you'll accomplish is your own destruction. Maybe. For the last time, Lat, come home with me. No. Howdy, Senator. Just lookin' for a sucker. Take a hand? What's the game? Stud. Deal me in. Pour the senator a drink, Swede. Not out of that bottle. Something wrong with my whiskey, Senator? I don't drink out of the same bottle with a man who beats up women. - King high. - Open for a five. I'll call. Senator? I'm in. Is that your own money, Senator... or a tramp's dowry? - Deal me out. - Me too. Swede, pour the senator a drink... out of that bottle. Come on! Hit him! Stop it! Stop this! Stop it! Oh! No! Oh, stop! Whoo! Oh, Lord! Oh! Get him good! Come on! I'm trying to understand. I guess I need educating, like your cows. Only with me, it might take a little longer. I told Link Gorham I'm gonna testify at Callie's trial. - It's not gonna be pleasant. - Will it help her? Link thinks it will. - Will it be the truth? - Yes. Then you testify. You're cold.
