His story hasn't changed? Almost to the word. I'd like to hear it from him. Okay, but he's gonna tell you exactly- - I'd still like to hear it from him. Okay. Hey Willie, how are we today? I'd like to hear about your camping trip. We're here to help, but you need to tell us exactly what happened. Ask the others. We have their versions.

We're gonna get the guys together. We're gonna get drunk. You know, maybe play "truth or dare". No talk of divorce, lawyers. None of that bullshit, man. No worries. Doctor's orders. Will, you're a foot doctor. A podiatrist is the correct term. Thanks. And that's still a doctor. A doctor who smokes cigarettes. It's a little bit like a dentist with bad teeth, right? Dentists get paid more than me. But don't worry about that, I'm quittin'. Been talkin' about quitting since we were in high school. Yeah? Well there something about hangin' out with you guys just brings it outta me. Here you go. That's you. Hey, check this out. What? All right. Three, two. Here it comes. - There you go. - Thank you. Have a good one. Oh my god. Dawson, is that Cooper Dunn? The Cooper Dunn? In the goddamn flesh. Slick Willie. Didn't you go and grow up, huh? Still overdressin' I see though. You look like a scientologist. Yeah, you should join. It might help your career. Been too long, Coop. Hey, maybe for you losers. Time flies when you're livin' the dream, lemme tell you. Oh, the dream. The dream. I heard you moved back home. Well that's just a temporary blip on the radar. All right. Ya got it? Yup. How you doin'? All right. So where's the leechster at, huh? Somethin' came up back at home. Said he's gonna meet us at the spot. All right, yeah. Classic leech. Is he still livin' in his ma's basement? Well not 'til he has enough of that lake house, you know? He's a children's book author now. Shut up. This is it, boys. Our destiny awaits. 1,500 miles of uninhabited wilderness. Oh, check this out. Thank you, Melanie. Are you kiddin' me? Not bad, right? I'm talkin' about your luggage. Oh, I know. I'm not. All right, let's go. One, two, three. Got it? We got it. Yup. There we go. That's not bad. - Even. - I got it. All right, all right. You got it. - Too soon, man. - Okay. Doin' all right, Coop? Yeah. I'm good. Yeah, we'll be fuckin' there soon. All right, over there. We better parallel park when we're there. Yeah, bro. All right, will. That was a very interesting move. Oh, doesn't get better than that. You got that? - Yup. - Dawson. Will! I got it, c'mon. Put your hand on there. Jesus Christ, buddy. You gotta just jump over there, bro. Hold on. All right. Dawson! All right. Where you at, Coop? Need some help? I'm kidding. Wait up! Richie, Jack. Oh boy, look at these guys. Oh gosh and Cooper Dunn! Lieutenant man himself. Magic legs and who're you supposed to be again? I always say a cross between Waldo and the brawny man. Oh, really? 'Cause I say you can all go fuck yourselves. Oh, shots fired. Oh, look at you! You made it. 'Sup, man? How are ya? Bring it in. - How you doin'? - Come here. Yeah, now we're talkin'. - It's good to see you. - What's going on, man? How are ya? Good, good, good. - You good? - Yeah. For crying out loud. Will, I hear you're some sort of foot doctor now. Yeah, somethin' like that. It's called a podiatrist. Finally put that foot fetish to good use, huh? Finally put that- - shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up! Hey, get me a beer. Shut up. You want me to carve you a pizza? You're a real piece of work. You're a real piece of work, this guy. Jackson, which one of these tents for me, pal? Nah, Jack. This is incredible. Thank you for setting it up, man. Appreciate it. Though Richie here did most of the work. Most? Yeah, try all. Two tours in Afghanistan and I didn't have to lug around as much shit as this guy made me. He just sits down here relaxin' drinkin' a beer. He's got me climbin' trees, danglin' off limbs and put his fuckin' star camera up in the sky just relaxing on vacation. He is on it. Bring it in. Look, this was last night. That my friends is the milky way. You should see it when we display this in the shop. It puts customers in like serious trance. Wow. Well that is fucking great, copernicus. But can we get back to tents now? 'Cause I wanna be as far as I possibly can from all of you, especially Dawson. Now that I remember how loud he snores. 'Cause I need my fuckin' beauty sleep. Hey, you ever get tired of being you, Coop? No. Fuck it. Why? You're way out there, Mr. Bigshot, okay? That's Willie. That's Dawson. That's me and Richie over here. Oh fuck. And then lastly hey, speak of the devil. What's up, motherfuckers? Aww, dammit. Oh, what's the matter? What, you didn't think I'd make it? You have been known, leech. Bullshit. Look, you wouldn't have made it if you'd been through what I just went through. I mean shit, first my publicist calls me, right? She's on the phone with me for four hours talkin' my ear off. I'm like, "oh my god, you're stressed out." So I go to stop, pull over and get a beer, right? Go to pay for the beer, lost my fuckin' wallet. Jesus Christ. I don't even wanna tell you what I had to do to negotiate these bad boys. Seriously, another story, another time. Shit's fucked. Anyway, I get on the highway, right? Cruisin' and making good time. All of a sudden I'm drivin', boom! Fuckin' 25 point buck comes outta fuckin' nowhere. I'm like. "Get out the fuckin' way, baby!" Skiddin', get off to the side. Turn the car off. Stalls, dead. Won't start. I'm fucked. You ever try hitchhikin' with a fuckin' canoe on your back? Shit is real, bro. Wow. You know, I work with liars all day long and that is grade-a bullshit. Are you fuckin' insane? No, man. It happened. We know you had to make your bed, give that hot mom a little foot rub. Fuck you, man. I'm not the foot doctor here. Podiatrist! Goddammit. Oh yeah, it is podiatrist. What's up, man? - What up, Richie? - Dude. Those tents are fully-loaded. I appreciate this. And they got everything you need. Now we're talkin', man. Hey, any chance you got cell towers in these tents? No, man. Great. Our fans are not gonna like that. I'm sure all three of 'em will survive. At least they're not fuckin' four years old. So what? Who needs cell towers when you have this? Oh shit. That's my shit right there. Motherfuckin' Jack. It's like "Friday the 13th" and studio 54. Dude, is everything a movie reference? Hey, you remember how to use this? You know, it's a little "field of dreams". But what the heck? That's what I'm sayin'. That's strike two. That's it right there. Fuckin' a, man. Do you remember Mae Darnell? Oh god, who can forget? Cans out to here, am I right? Dude, you're the creepiest man. Who fuckin' says can? No, he's right. She worked at Hooters for a couple years back home. And awkward as that shit was, I went. I fuckin' made that to sit behind home plate and fuckin' go crazy. Everyone at Dawson's game, you remember that? She'd go fuckin' nuts every time you pitched. I always thought she was gonna get with him over anybody. Oh dude. Well you know, Cooper fuckin' cock-blocked me. She put her pants down. I said, "hey, what's goin' on?" Let him have sex with one girl. Gentlemen, if I may. To the good old days and reliving them one drunken weekend at a time. Yeah. And to Dawson and all his relentless attempts getting us here. - Somebody remembered. - Yeah, right. Strength in unity. Unity in strength! Oh god. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Cooper, what's goin' on? You're not joining us. Are you gonna in the spirit or what? Hollywood. Look, I cheers. It's cool. Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool! All right, fuckin' just shut the fuck up. Unity in strength. What're you lookin' at? Oh shit! What's up, yo? What's up? What's goin' on, dude? Glad you made it, man. Hey, what's going on, girl? - Hey. - You look beautiful. Hi. Okay, cool. Yo, you guys. You remember the wizard, right? No. But you might remember me. Did we sleep together in high school? In your dreams. That's unlikely. I just have far too much sex in real life to ever dream about it. Oh. Hysterical. Hey, I'm Dawson. Yeah, yo and that's Vera and fauna. Hi. So yo, why don't you guys get set up, right? And when you come back, we got some beers right here with your names on it. Cool. Right on. Rock and roll. Fuckin' the wizard, man. That guy's so fuckin' cool I can't stand it. Awesome. Are you fucking kidding me? The fucking wizard? The fuck? Guys, the wizard's cool, man. It wasn't part of the plan, leech. I don't want no strangers eating our food and drinkin' all our beer. What the hell are you thinkin'? I took time off of work to hang out with you guys, not some party crashers. First of all, okay? The wizard doesn't crash parties, all right? He is the party. Plus yo, he's got this shop on main street now called puff, puff glass. I've never seen so many buds. The whole fuckin' backroom is like- - I don't care if he owns the Warner brothers, man. Get him out of here. Hey, you're awfully quiet over there, Dawson. You have an opinion? You shoulda asked us first. Well what the fuck am I supposed to do, huh? I can't just ask him to up and leave. Sure you can. Just fuckin' ask him. Dude, they just got here. It's about to be dark out soon. Oh, you're worried about their safety. They're like the fuckin' manson family. Oh, Jesus. You know what I say? I say leech get the fuck outta here and he takes him with him. - I second that. - The fuck? Oh, fuck that. Fuck that, dude. You should go. - Yeah, leech. - What the fuck? Dude. What do you fuckin' want, man? The fuck is wrong with you? Guys. You're gettin' aggressive and shit. Guys. Hey, we're not sending them away or leech, all right? We waited for too long to get back here. So as unfortunate as this situation is, we're gonna find a silver lining. Silver lining. Well if I may, the sausage fest is gettin' a little rough on the eyes and the one kinda has a little bit of a Christina ricci thing goin' on. That's what I'm talkin' about. That was part of my plan all along. I guess we were always better when we had somethin' to compete over. All right, then it's settled. We just make the best outta this. Tomorrow, we're sendin' them on their way. - Cool. - All right? - Cool. - All right. But if that asshole even enters my airspace, takin' him down. Please, dude. This shit's gonna be so much more badass now. You're fuckin' welcome all of you. I'm gonna need a few more beers. - More beer. - I'll take one, Jack. Grab some beers, baby. You're welcome for real. Yeah 'cause that means you have tourette's for some odd reason. Well you know what didn't make sense? I remember you always talked about joining the military. I didn't think you'd actually do it. Hey man, they recruit like mad. Promise you an education you don't have time for afterwards if you don't die of course. Well it can't be any worse than the medical field, huh Willie? I mean how many lawsuits you up to now, man? 10? You made double digits? Look. Look, man. The thing to do now is to sue a doctor, okay? Everybody thinks webmd is smarter than me. It don't take much. Well I'm gonna go kill myself. You really don't remember me? No. Well a lotta people remember you, Mr. Ace on the mound. Rumor is you bought a farm and settled down with a woman real quick. And I'm still married for now at least. I remember you. You remember girls you never slept with? Didn't you have like one successful TV show 10 years ago? I heard no one'll cast you because you're such a dickbag now. You know, variety can go fuck themselves. And for your information, I'm in the works right now with a fuckin' whale. Have you heard of Martin scorsese? That's amazing. Dead mobster #4 is the perfect role for you. Whatever. I don't entertain criticism from Helena bonham Carter wannabes. Sure you don't. Wow. Right on, man. Hey man. You know what, man? I know it's more mainstream, but I still feel shady. This coming from the guy who used to put video cameras in the girls' locker room. There's no evidence that that was me. You know they say pot won't kill you? Well it did once. And when I came back, my life was changed forever. I was there. This will enlighten you in many, many ways. Is that right? Oh shit. Holy shit. - Oh. - I know, right? Right? ♪ Headin' out towards the moon ♪ Holy shit. Now if I may be so bold as to suggest. This'll really get this night goin'. What is that? Potion 80. All your favorite psychotropic effects rolled into one little piece of glorious heaven. This shit is no joke, man. But there's like virtually no hangover the next morning. Did you make that yourself, man? I learned it from the ancient druids of stonehenge. They used to take it annually on the winter solstice. When I died, I visited the akashic records. There, you could learn anything and everything about human history, like even how to craft these. You're welcome. You'll thank me later. Pass it down. Pass it down. Psss it down. Hell yes. Dawson, c'mon, man. Yo, seriously this shit is like nothing you've ever experienced before. Would I ever steer you wrong? Guys, strength in unity.

Fuck. What the hell happened last night, man? That's an interesting question. Dawson, what's goin' on, man? What? It's bad. It's bad. What? Dawson. Dawson. Maybe he's passed out. No. Fuck you, dude. Fuck you, dude. You don't know. This ain't cuttin' off somebody's bunions, man. This is his fuckin' life. I'm a doctor, leech. I know a dead body when I see one. No. Bullshit, man! Bullshit! Oh fuck, dude. Oh fuck. How the hell'd this happened? He fell, man. Why'd you have to put his tent so close to the fuckin' edge for? I didn't roll him out of it, did I? - Fuck you. - Guys, does it really matter? We need to get help. Jack, do you have reception? The boosters only reach so far. We're literally in the middle of fucking nowhere. I still can't believe he's dead. He's fuckin' dead. What the fuck? So what now? I'm gonna go find the girls and that fucking wizard. He's right. Maybe he'll tell us what the fuck happened last night. Willie? You knew then, didn't you? Didn't you? All right, easy. Go ahead, Willie. Continue. I only brought enough for me. I'm not playing mom to you man boys. Where are the others? I was wondering the same thing about you a minute ago, as in I have no idea. What happened last night? A lotta shit happened last night. Luckily, only some of it was homoerotic. Listen, chick. We're done with your attitude. Easy, Richie. She obviously has no idea. No idea about what? He looks so small from here. What are you, five? So what are we gonna do now? We need help. No shit. I mean we get help, Richie. Well we can't just leave him here. There's like bears and vultures and shit. Vultures? Dude, this isn't the fuckin' Sahara. No, he's right. We should drag him up here or somethin'. No, we shouldn't do that. No, will. We should. No man left behind. Look, man. We're not gonna move any bodies until the cops come over here and sort all this out. What is there to sort out? He fell from a steep-ass cliff. I mean you checked his vitals, right? He's gone, man. You don't think it was an accident. I don't work in forensics. I just think we all don't know what happened after a certain point, so we should all just figure all that out before we start movin' bodies. What the hell are you tryin' to say, man? Spit it out! He doesn't have one broken bone, man. Not one broken bone, not one scrape on his whole body. There's no way he fell down this cliff. He's got a huge fucking gash on his head. A gash? You think you're gonna fall down a cliff and just get a gash? So wait, wait, wait. What are you tryin' to say, man, that one of us killed Coop? No. It's not possible. Not possible. None of us could've killed Coop. But that fucking wizard. I knew that guy's a piece of shit the minute he arrived. Hey, you don't know him. He wouldn't hurt a fly. She's right, dude. He wouldn't. Yeah, so don't go accusing people who aren't here to defend themselves. - Or you'll do what? - Hey, hey, hey. Easy, easy. Hey, hey. Once we get the cops here, they're gonna sort it all out. No way, man. No way. We're not goin' to the cops. I got a family. I got a business, man. We're not doin' that shit. What are we gonna say: "Hey Mr. Policeman," we had a huge party last night, did a bunch of drugs and now one of our friends is dead"? Yeah. Yeah, that's exactly what we're gonna say. Are you serious? I'm fucking nervous, man. When I'm nervous, you'll tolerate your own alcoholism when you admit it exists. Have another cigarette. We need to send someone to get the cops immediately. Nobody leaves. We need everyone here when that wizard bastard gets back. We'll get the truth out of him then. Richie, will you fuckin' listen to yourself, man? First of all, he didn't do shit. How the fuck do you know that? Because he wouldn't hurt anyone. Yeah, says his groupie. Where were you last night? And come to think of it, where were you this morning when Dawson was yellin' for everyone? I don't have to explain myself to you, little man. Okay, bitch. That's it. Enough, enough. Hey, this is insane. How am I the only one who knows that we need to get the police? Because fucking Cooper was murdered, Dawson, and someone here last night did it. And if we don't figure out who, the cops are gonna put us all away. Don't you get it? Yeah. Yeah, he's right, Dawson. We're all accomplices right now. I can't have my name tainted by somethin' like this. You? Try explaining this to a wife and two kids, man. Fuck. On the other hand, how long do we plan to sleuth around here? 'Cause we did a serious number on our food and water supply last night. Long as it takes, Jack. I mean we don't even know where he ran off to yet. We need all the information before we start including outsiders. I'm with Dawson, man. I say we call the cops, let them figure this shit out. All right, well let's take a vote then. No. It's not necessary, Richie. We just send one person and it's settled. It's all of us or none of us, Dawson. We decide as a group like we've always done. If you wanna leave, if you wanna stay. Hey will, let's go, man. Go on, will. You don't count, just us. Fuck you. What's it gonna be, Jack? Strength in unity. Unity in strength. All right. We stay, but we better get some answers right now. How the hell we supposed to do that? Follow me. So bruises on his wrists, neck. Signs of a struggle. Obviously a gash on his hand. Yeah, fist didn't do that. There must be a murder weapon. Willie. If someone used a weapon, they're not just gonna drop it right by the body. They're gonna dump it in the lake. Right. Well you're assigning logic to an illogical act. Whoever did this wasn't thinking clearly. Guys? Look at this. Seems like fuckin' blood all over it. I'll be damned. God, now we know. Blunt force trauma to the head. Dude, don't fuckin'. That's fucked up. Now the laceration is on the left side of his head. So whoever did this probably swung righty. Yeah, that's really useful 'cause we're all right-handed. Doesn't tell us anything. If we don't remember what happened last night, then we gotta find a motive. Yeah, we do. Gotta find a motive. So what's the last thing that you remember? I don't remember shit. Look, we gotta piece it together, all right? Hold on, it's comin' back to me. That other chick was all over Coop last night. They had some weird love/hate shit goin' on, man. Oh shit. She went back into his tent. At the end of the night, that's the last time I saw her. Yeah, me too. Hey, Vera and I just work together, all right? Why are you lookin' at me? Do I have to keep sayin' it? This is fucking crazy. Is it? 'Cause right now it all seems to add up. - Oh really? - Yes. Okay, sure. You know what? Let's jump on the crazy train for just a minute. Let's just say that the wizard drugged all of us so that he could send Vera to kill Coop for what, some kinda fuckin' fanboy fascination that he had? Sure, that makes sense. Then oh, what? They all wake up the next morning and take off. So if that's the case, you know what? Why don't we all just sit around here and wait? Do you really think if his crazy conspiracy is true that they're just gonna stroll back into camp? What's the story, morning glories? Where the fuck were you? What business is it of yours? Maybe Vera and I were off enjoyin' the sunrise on the water. Maybe we're engaged in a passionate cunnilingus along the slippery shore. Or maybe fuck off. Whoa, easy. Richie, Richie. You better put a muzzle on your dog, man. I don't do hostility. Yeah? You seemed pretty fuckin' okay though last night. The fuck are you talking about? Stay outta this, elvira. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - Chill, chill, chill, chill. Look, bros. Last night was a barrel of laughs, but this is seriously a toxic vibe. And frankly, I'm just not interested. Fauna, let's go. You gonna stop him? I'm more inclined to go with him at this point. Cooper's dad, man. That's unfortunate. See ya. - Fuck this shit. - Hey, wait. I told you I don't do hostility, man! Said don't fuckin' touch me. Fuckin' murderer. Was your friend shot? I didn't think so. Wouldn't hurt a fly, huh guys? Hey wiz, put that shit away, man. We don't need this gettin' outta hand. What do you mean, like your friend here already did? No, I put this away and he tries to torture me into some confession that I don't got like this Guantanamo bay. No fuckin' way. At least help us, man. Like tell us what happened last night. I know about as much as you do. And you? I fucked your popstar friend so hard he cried. Said he never had a woman like me in his entire life. I was so disgusted I just went back to my tent. Damn. Easy, Vera. The man's dead. I mean you asked her what happened. She's tellin' you. Shit, I remember hearin' that last night. Squealin' like a pig. Him. And the crying. Also him. Then she left. She's tellin' the truth, man. So I think, gentlemen, our little carousel here's reached its end. That still doesn't account for you. And probably never will. I could stay here all day and explain myself, but you dumb fuckin' jocks would probably still not believe me. Even though it's pretty obvious to me which one killed your friend. Strength in unity, my men. Fauna. We'll tell the police about you. Your drugs and your shady disappearance this morning. I don't think you'll be doin' any of that. My rap sheet doesn't need any more additions especially this little clusterfuck. If you want my advice and believe me, I think you do. I'd make a pact to never speak of this again. And I'd weigh that body down with the biggest rocks that you could find and I'd drop him in the depths of that lake. Toodles. Man, you can't go yet. Ooh. I said don't fuckin' touch me. Fuck! Oh shit. Richie, get off him, dude. Dude, stop! Get off of him! Just stop! What the fuck did you do? You motherfucker! All right, Richie. That's enough. That's enough. Come on. That's it. You fuckin' fuckin' fuck! Fuck, fuck! So it was Richie Valentino that killed them. He didn't mean to kill anybody. He was in Afghanistan and they pushed him over the edge. But you knew then that wizard and Vera did not kill Cooper. Go ahead and tell us what happened next. Richie wasn't the same after that. Fuck! Shit. I'm dead! Real great weekend, guys. Really fuckin' fun gettin' the gang back together. Hey guys, listen. We can make a strong case for self-defense. The wizard, he killed Cooper. No no no. And then the wizard pulled a gun out. He didn't kill Cooper, all right? But that fuckin' lunatic did kill both of my friends. He was protecting his friends. Your peaceful cult leader put a gun to my head. Yeah because you accosted him. Are you fuckin' serious right now? Yes! But a fuckin' tarp on 'em? They're dead! I shoulda gone right when I saw Coop's body. Then we would've suspected you. Who cares? The cops would be here. This wouldn't even be happening. Where do you think you're going? Home! Nobody leaves! Get her, Jack. Get her! Yo, she didn't do anything. That's super fucked up. Nothing has changed! Nobody leaves 'til we figure this out. You just killed two innocent people. What the fuck is there to figure out? We voted to stay. Nobody's goin' anywhere until we come up with some answers. I didn't vote on shit. So with all due respect, fuck off! Don't let her leave, Jack. Get the fuck off of me! Get the fuck off of me! Richie. Now come on, man. What the hell you think you're doin'? She can't go! - Richie. - Fuck! Gimme your hands. Hands! Gimme your hands. No! Fuckin' hold 'em, hold 'em. Keep 'em there. Keep 'em there. Keep 'em there. Hold her, hold her. I got her. I got her. I got her. You're better than this. Jack. Listen, man. Jack, this doesn't make any sense, man. She will bolt the first chance she gets, Dawson. I'm sorry. We're not goin' to the police. Not just for Richie's sake. Your farm? Gone. Willie's practice, gone. My family, my business. It's all gone. The only thing that we can do is stick together. No one needs to check in with the real world 'til after the weekend, right? So nobody leaves until we figured this out. The fuck? Real nice group of friends you got here. So what, we're just collecting wood now, pretending like everything's okay? We're just gonna do whatever Richie wants us to do? How are we gonna get outta this? Dawson, we gotta find out what happened with Cooper, man. Someone's not tellin' us somethin'. Are you talkin' about fauna? Naw, man. I'm not talkin' about just fauna, not just her. You just said it yourself. If the wizard killed Coop, then rich didn't do anything wrong. Did you see what he did to his face? And that's not normal. That's PTSD. No, it's not PTSD. I keep thinkin' about it. What reason did the wizard have to kill Cooper? Wizard had no reason to want Cooper dead. What, do you think one of us did? Okay. Here you go. You gotta eat somethin'. Yeah? You're just as bad as them, you know? By letting them do this. I'm not. It's the same as if you did it yourself. All right. I'll be back. We need to talk, guys. What the fuck is there left to talk about? I'm done starving to death. We're gonna leave. We're gonna get the cops. We already voted on that. Great. We're gonna vote again. Nothing's changed. If anything, we have more reason to stay and figure this out. Could we please just fuckin' go to sleep and talk about this tomorrow? Are you fuckin' kiddin' me? What if one of us dies in the morning? What are you talking about? I'm talkin' about the wizard obviously not killing Cooper. You think that guy overpowered him? The guy had a gun, right? You think he woulda used it? Vera, her story, that alibi. That checks out. Whoever killed Cooper is right here. No fuck that, dude. Fuck that. We've known each other our whole lives. Not her. We don't know her. You're gonna leave fauna outta this, all right? I know her and she had no reason to kill Coop or anybody. Now somebody here had a motive. So we gotta look at ourselves and ask the honest questions: Which one of us is capable of committing murder? I am a United States marine. We don't kill our own. A sick fuck. Lay off Richie. He's been through enough, man. Spare me the dad routine, you alcoholic fuck. Fuck you, leech. Fuck you. You come out here late and you fuckin' bring the wizard. You back his drugs and you probably fuckin' killed Coop, got us all fucked up to make it look like an accident. That's not a motive, you fuckin' moron. And you were the one who was always jealous of Coop. So jealous that you filmed him in the shower, you sick fuck. Okay. First thing, nobody complained about that then, right? Second, filming the beautiful female form and killing your fuckin' friend is like apples to oranges. If anybody was jealous of Coop's women, it was fuckin' Dawson. Dawson? Mae Darnell was just the tip of the pussy iceberg. Jesus. Claire, Danielle and busty orbin. I wouldn't be surprised if Coop flew back from Hollywood just to fuck Dawson's wife. You better not fuckin' say Ashley's name! Hey, hey! I swear I will fuck you up! Jack, Jack, Jack. You're not helping. You're not helping, Jack. You're not so fuckin' clean yourself, fuckin' Mr. Malpractice. Yeah, no shit. Willie, how do you kill a patient by rubbing cream on fungus all day? I don't need to explain shit to you. Because drunkenly hanging up speakers and lights, that shit doesn't even compare to the first day of medical school. Hey, what day of medical school do they teach you how to gas patients to death, man? Oh Jesus, Jack. Why would you say that, man? - What day is that? - Hit him, Willie. - You gonna fuckin' hit me? - Hit him. He deserves to be fuckin' hit. Hit me, bitch. Fuckin' hit me. Right in the face. - Just fuckin' hit me. - Fuck you, leech! No, fuck you! It was wizard, so everybody shut the fuck up. Yeah, okay. Hey you know, sleepin' on it probably isn't the worst idea right now, you know? Jesus, why are my ideas only good when they come outta one of your fuckin' mouths? Strength in unity, huh? You should probably get some sleep, man. You need it more than any of us. Stayed awake for 72 hours straight on tour. I'll keep watch. Yeah you know, but you're not on tour anymore. The third day, it was his family. Everyone always thinks you're in this battlefield in the middle of nowhere, but really you're in a quiet village. When you walk down the streets, you see the villagers who haven't fled yet and you wonder which of 'em's gonna shoot you in the back. Okay, but you don't have to go back there right now, Richie. There's gunfire everywhere. Bombs. Heard a buddy cry out once and I whipped around and fired. It was a mother holding her baby. Fuckin' newborn. It's over now, Richie. It's okay. Except it isn't, Dawson. So I'll keep watch. Goodnight. Richie? Richie. You couldn't sleep either. You know, before we got out here, I thought my life was ending. Because of Ashley? Yeah. And then all this. You have your problems at home. They just seem so I don't know, insurmountable. But you're alive, you're healthy. You know? Just gives you some perspective. You know, if this is what it takes, I don't want it. And divorce, bills, endless work, losin' baseball games. I mean that shit all has a silver lining. What's the silver lining here? I love you, man. Love you too, man. Goodnight, Dawson. All right. Dawson! - Dawson! - Dawson! Dawson, get up! - Wake up, man. - Get up, man! What? What's wrong? We shouldn't have slept on it. What happened? Where's fauna? The bodies. That's only the half of it, man. Coop's body's gone. No, that's bullshit. It's gone, man. - Come on. - It's not there anymore! Come on, dude. Let's go. Come on. No, no. Richie. Richie! Richie! - Richie! - Richie! What'd you do, ritchie? Richie, where'd you go? Yo, somethin' is seriously wrong with this. You don't think he killed her, do you? No, man. He didn't just fuckin' kill a woman for no reason. What if he had a reason? Oh, we gotta find him right now. All right, well he didn't go far. Yeah, especially if he's draggin' dead bodies around. Leech, shut the fuck up, man. What? Am I gonna be the only one who says it? We can't just keep ignoring the glaring evidence 'cause we used to fuckin' hang out together. That's my best friend that you're talkin' about. And we're gonna split up. Cover more ground that way, all right? - I call you. - All right. No, you can't just call him. What're you saying? Bullshit. I know you two are gonna try to buddy up as always. I'm not gettin' stuck with psychopath's friend over there. - What your mouth, leech. - What if they're in on it? What if they're fuckin' in on it? You know what then? Then your dead body will give us way more information than your alive one has. Leech and I, we're goin' this way. Go! You guys circle back that way. Let's go, move! Oh man, I'm tellin' you, Jack. Jack, watch your fuckin' step. Jack, you gotta hear me out, man. Jack. Fuck. What, man? Talk to me. I could really use a drink right now, man. Jack, you need some water. Cut the Dr. will shit for a minute and talk to me like a friend. Talk to me like a fuckin' friend, man. Okay. You really think Richie did all this? I don't know. I don't know, man. Guys, over here! No. Richie? We just found him. He won't listen to us, man. Richie, what the hell are you doin', man? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh shit. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Dawson, Dawson. No, man. He's gone, bro. He's gone. Look at him. I've seen these signs before. We can't help him. Good. Good 'cause I'm not goin' anywhere near that fuckin' lunatic. Richie. Richie. Hey. It's me, Dawson. Hey, you remember that semi-final game against point? Yeah, man. The meat of that lineup was bigger than our dads. I kept shakin' off your signs and you thought I was doin' it just to piss you off. But really I was just afraid to throw them anything. Richie, I swear. Man if you hadn't been talkin' in their ear that whole game, those guys would've put up 20 on me. Instead you threw a three-hitter. Well that was your framing. The ump was callin' them at the shins. It's all gone wrong, Dawson. I know, Richie. But we're gonna get through this like everything. Yeah, he's right, Richie. There's nothin' that we can't overcome. I'm trained to shoot first, protect each other and then do. And you're not there anymore, Richie. You're with us now. You guys got families, businesses. Me, I got nothin'. You're with us, Richie. You got us, man. I killed 'em, Dawson. I killed them both. Lock me up forever. But I didn't kill Coop. I loved him, just like I love all of you. Richie. We love you too, man. We love you too. Come on. Let's go back to the camp. Get the good news. Let's get the hell outta here. No, no! Fuck, man. Richie, what the fuck? Say it was me. All of it. What? No. Richie, Richie. Wait. No, don't! No, don't! - Fuck. - Richie, wait! Richie! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. So Richie wanted to take the fall for you. Jesus. We knew he didn't kill Cooper. We all knew that. And soon you were gonna find out that you were right. Maybe the wizard was right. Maybe we should just leave and say the others went off and never came back. I mean we're in the middle of nowhere, right? So what are the odds that somebody's gonna find the bodies? I'd say pretty good, leech. Considering we told everybody that we're comin' to stillwater for the reunion. Bodies don't just fuckin' disappear. Do you guys think he killed her? I mean he said, "I killed them both," but he never said anything about fauna. Doesn't mean anything. Traumatic events can often trigger repression of memory. He could've done it and just blocked it out of his mind. Does it fucking matter? He's gone. Coop's gone. Shut the fuck up for five minutes so I can mourn the loss of my friend. Man, what a fuckin' idiot. What a fucking idiot. Which one of us are you talkin' about specifically? Do you think anyone's gonna believe that Richie tied a rope around his neck and then he jumps off a cliff with a bag of rocks in the same spot as all the other bodies? That'll look like we killed him and the others and tried to hide the evidence. Richie pinned this whole thing on us. That's what he fuckin' did. That idiot. He was tryin' to save us. Don't go around talkin' shit about Richie. It was stupid and it was fuckin' idiotic! All of it! He shoulda died in Afghanistan! He fucking- - Jack! Oh Jesus. Yo, chill! Get off of him. Get off of him. Ow. Fuck. Get off of him. - Chill, chill. - It's over. Done, we're done, we're done. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. When did this flip over? We'll know soon enough. Holy shit. It saw everything. The fuck? You slept with her? Why didn't you tell us? It's none of your business. Shit, it's Coop. What the fuck? What the fuck is this? Why were you yellin' at Cooper? Dawson. It's personal. Yeah, this whole thing's pretty fuckin' personal, don't you think? Hey! C'mon, get him, Willie. Wait, Dawson, wait! Dawson, why you runnin', man? Get him. Why you runnin', Dawson? Guys, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Just wait, just fuckin' wait. Wait. Just wait! Leave him alone! He fuckin' killed Coop. Everything that's happened is his fuckin' fault. Strength in unity. Unity of fuckin' strength. He's gonna go for the canoes. Dawson! Dawson, wait! Dawson, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, Dawson. Don't do anything stupid, Willie. Come on, you know I didn't do it. I know, man. I know. Dawson, I cannot convince those guys or my own brother. If you take off, they're gonna think you did this. Think about it. It's too far gone, Willie. You know there's nothing I can say to change their minds. - Dawson. - We shoulda gone to the fuckin' police! No one else had to die, Willie. Dawson, just listen to me. Dawson, just wait. Yo guys, wait! Fuck! Fuck, no! No! Wait. - I didn't do it. - Wait. Jesus, Jack. Would you let him speak? There's nothin' left for him to say. Dawson please, man. You gotta tell us right now what happened between you and Cooper. The truth, right now. Cooper was fuckin' my wife, all right? Ever since he came back home, he's been fuckin' my wife. When did you find out? Just that night. Look, I knew she was cheatin' on me, but I didn't know. I didn't know it was him. He got drunk and as always, he just couldn't shut his mouth. And you waited 'til now to tell us? I didn't wanna believe it. I didn't wanna. Coop's supposed to be my friend. And you fuckin' killed him. Ow, goddammit! - Jack! - Enough! Stop! Why, so he can tell us even more lies? No, I call bullshit. He's the one who set this whole trip up. I bet he knew that Cooper and ash were havin' an affair before we even got out here. Wait a second. When I went back to my tent, you knew Richie was out of it. Do you know where she went? What? You know where she is, don't you? My canoe's gone. He let her go. He fuckin' let her go. You made us believe Richie killed her, you motherfucker. You sent her to the cops? What are you tryin' to do, man? You tryin' to set us all up? What the fuck, man? What the fuck? You are fucking disgusting. And if I'm goin' down, I am taking you with me. Last fuckin' chance, Dawson. Last chance, man. Why does it matter? You made up your mind. Matters to me. Tell me right now. What happened? She was my whole fuckin' life, man. And Coop. Coop, he just takes and takes and doesn't think about anyone. Strength in unity? That son of a bitch didn't care about us. And you, you brought the perfect scapegoat, man. But Richie, fuckin' Richie. No, we could've put it on the wizard and nobody would've cared. But he had to lose his fuckin' mind, huh? You with your fuckin' camera. Why don't you just delete that shit, huh? Let sleeping dogs lie. No. No, you're gonna chase me down. You're gonna break my fuckin' leg. Yeah. Defending a wife-stealing homewrecker and a drug lord and a psychopath, yeah? No. Fuck you guys. Fuck Richie. Do it. Fuckin' dare you, do it. Huh? Watchin'. I'll be waitin' for you fuckers in hell. Do it. Fuckin' goddammit! Fucker! Goddammit! I'm sorry, Willie. I know this is tough on you. What happened after Dawson Walker died? Is that really important? Yes. Yes, it is. I'd argue it's the most important event of all, will. So what happened? Out with it. Oh, come on. I don't think this is- shut up. What happened before the boat reached the shore, will? What happened before the boat reached the shore? I don't remember. Yes, you do. Yes, you do, will. You can reach for it. I hope I'm not interrupting. Gentlemen, what the fuck happened last night? You wouldn't fuckin' believe what happened to me. I don't even know where to fuckin' begin. So don't tell me you pussies fuckin' forgot about me. Dawson! Look at this, guys. Fuck did you guys do? No. No, no. You're fuckin' with my head. But I'm gonna tell you another story, one that starts with a misdiagnosis. A misdiagnosis that doesn't take into account the pulse-slowing drugs from the night before. One that misreads a laceration for foul play. Slow down. You're gonna lose him. Maybe he needs a push. According to Cooper Dunn- - I needed time to cool off. You know, for Dawson to cool off. Just fucked up as I was, I knew I had to get away from him. So I went down to the lake alone. I started hitting pine cones with a stick. I don't know, I guess I missed one and fell. But the next thing I know, I'm wakin' up on the ground. My head is fucking throbbing. I'm not sure if I'm still high on drugs or if I'm just hung over. And I only thought I was out for couple hours tops. I had no idea I was out for the whole day. I meant to head back to camp, took a wrong turn. And next thing I know, I'm fucking lost at night in these deep-ass woods. So I sat down to rest then passed out. Next mornin', I wake up then I found 'em and I wish I hadn't. I don't understand. Lemme spell it out for you. There was no foul play. Since Cooper was ever killed, Dawson never confessed, did he? Did he, Willy? I didn't do it. I didn't kill Cooper. You're a liar! You're a liar! Willie! You're a liar! - Willie, stop. - You're a fuckin' liar! Will, stop, man. - Tell me the truth! - Fuckin' let him go. - You're a liar! - Willie, stop! You're my best fuckin' friend and you fuckin' lied to me! You're supposed to be my fuckin' friend. You're supposed to tell me the truth. No. You said so yourself. A traumatic event can trigger repression of memories. It can block out your own malicious deeds. Will, sooner or later, you're gonna have to accept what you did. Next. What do you think? Do I think he believes his own story? Maybe. I mean it's possible he's made up an alternate version of reality to protect himself from his own actions. Yeah. And maybe he's faking. He's intelligent enough to know what's at stake here. And living out your days in a psych ward? Hell of a lot better than state prison. God and if he is, he's a good fuckin' actor.
