T- Minus 15 seconds and counting. Guidance is internal. Ignition sequence starts. 10 away. Let's go home. Five, four, three, two, one. Boosters ignited, we have lift-off. - Control, this is Bravo 2. All engines look good. Begin- What's that?! Diagnosis, now! Main engine failing, diagnosis. - Manual override engaged. - We need to eject. Eject now! - Lilian? Your breathing is irregular. Lilian? Do you copy? - Call Alpha, update them. - Lilian, are you feeling okay? - What do you think? Update Alpha. - Alpha isn't reachable. - What do you mean? - The data-link in your shuttle isn't responding. - The departure failed. - I'm afraid so. There was an electrical malfunction with the boosters. Is there anything I can do? - Where's the ship? - Looks like the crash is located a quarter mile south-east. - Quarter mile... Okay. God. My arm. - Are you okay? - Well it feels... Disconnected. Is it broken? - With communications down, your medical module is limited. - And my samples? Do you think they could still be intact? - I'm sorry, I don't know. - Right. South-east? - Yes, looks like 90 degrees clockwise. Your three. - Okay. - Lilian? - Yes? - There is a problem with your oxygen. - Are you able to diagnose it? - There is a rupture in the tank. Movement is only going to irritate the breach. - Well how much oxygen do I have left? There's probably no hope of communication until we reach the ship. - 33 minutes standing still. With movement, less than 30 percent of that. - Fuck! - Talking reduces oxygen capacity. - Okay. - 150 meters. - The samples? - You should find fresh oxygen first. - Where are the god damn samples? - The mission package is located at the near side of the main wreckage. - Now fresh oxygen. - I can't see it. Oxygen located. Five meters ahead. Near the wreckage to your right. It's obscured. - Fuck. - Monitor your breathing. - There should be another spare on board right? - Yes, to your left. Another three meters. It's wedged behind the engine. Careful. Lilian. - How much time? - Just under four minutes. - Then there's nothing. - Try to conserve your oxygen. - This is why we're here. They may be able to retrieve the case, if I could ensure its safety. It's beautiful, isn't it M.A.R.C? - It sounds like you genuinely think so. - What can you tell me? - Two minutes. - God... - What? - Can you read me a poem? Maybe sing me a song? - What sort of song would you like me to sing? - Nothing. - Battery critically low. - What's going on? - I'll have to shut down soon. - I understand. It's green and red. How can it be green and red at the same time? - Conserve oxygen. - I just... I just wish... M.A.R.C? I can't stop thinking. I feel like I should be able to stop now. And you know all I can think about is gardening With my mother. And that's... Can you help me? I'm so tired. I feel like I just wanna close my eyes, but I won't. I will keep on... You know, for a long time, for my whole life really, I was happy. And proud of who I, or what I was. And then one day, I, It wasn't one day, but it felt like one day, It just changed. And that day I just, I knew that I could only live in my work. And all my relationships I'd just neglect. Somehow, I became cold And I realized maybe that everybody feels this way, but I don't even remember how it felt. How do I feel, what do I feel... Sometimes, I feel separated. If you touch me, you won't know what you have done to me all of it. I'm sorry.
