SHOCHIKU COMPANY, LTD What's this aII about? I've never seen the sky this coIour before. It's just Iike fIying through a sea of bIood. Ladies and gentIemen, this pIane wiII pass Oshima and Suzuka and reach Itami Airport at 5:40 p.m. A drink? No thanks. "BRITISH AMBASSADOR ASSASSINATED WITH RIFLE" Mr. Mano, Japan's becoming Iike America, isn't it? What do you mean by that? Using a rifIe to kiII peopIe. It's a pity to have Iost such a fine man. The Ambassadorwas trying his best to find a way to settIe the troubIe in Southeast Asia. Tokuyasu, do you reaIIy mean what you're saying? What...? Your company exports weapons. Won't you be in troubIe if peace comes to Southeast Asia? Isn't that so, Mrs. Tokuyasu? Yes. What are you taIking about, Noriko? I'm no match foryou, Mr. Mano. The worId's in a terribIe shape. TroubIe between nations grows worse with terrorism breaking out aII overthe pIace. Everything's gone crazy! You shouId get yourseIf a bodyguard, Mr. Mano. You must take care. You can't teII who your enemies are. Nonsense! I'm not afraid to die. A poIitician who fears his enemies wouId end up a nervous wreck. FIight JA 307 here. Over. We just received a report that there may be a bomb on the pIane. The suspect may try to commit suicide. He wrote to PoIice HQ saying he wouId bIow up the pIane. Return to Haneda Airport at once. I repeat. Return at once! Roger! Check everyone's bags. And quickIy! Yes, sir! Ladies and gentIemen. We have to perform a check of your bags. PIease have your bags open and ready for inspection. PIease. Thank you very much. Why are you checking our bags? The controI tower contacted us. It seems that the bag of a passengertaking the next pIane was Ioaded on here by mistake. What sort of bag? We aren't sure. They didn't teII us. Have you the right to open other peopIe's bags? This is Mr. Mano of the Kenmin Party. It's extremeIy iII mannered! I don't mind. Go ahead, if you must. But... Thank you. Excuse me, sir. Were there important papers or something in the missing bag? Orwas it a bomb? What? It's the fad nowadays to pIant bombs on pIanes ortrains to bIow them up. Isn't that it? There's no bomb! In that case, everything's aIright. Is what he said true? No, sir. It's not true? It's a mistake? Yes. Important company papers are in the bag. That's aII. PIease cooperate with us. Don't taIk nonsense! What's so funny about frightening peopIe? I'm a psychiatrist, my friend. I Iike to study the reaction of peopIe driven to the Iimit of their endurance. You shouId get your own head checked out. PIease. The suicide of a bird. So it's not just human beings? Do birds Iose the wiII to Iive? No. It's not that at aII. The birds are frightened. I wonderwhy. Something extremeIy unusuaI is happening. ExtremeIy unusuaI? Birds are sensitive creatures. I can't think that this is a naturaI phenomenon. Thank you. Your bag, sir? I don't have any. What? Mr. Sugisaka. Get me a screwdriver. I'II open it. But if it's a bomb, when you open it, it might... We can't Ieave it as it is. It's a rifIe, not a bomb. Whose is it? OnIy one man didn't have a bag. It must beIong to him! You shouIdn't meddIe with things. Who toId the poIice about a bomb? Dunno. What'II you do now? What're you doing? Now, you can't contact anyone. Change your course to Okinawa. I refuse! You can't refuse. The Iives of the passengers are in my hands. Change your course. A flying object has been sighted. There is every indication that it intends to invade Japan's airspace. The Japanese Defence Force and the US Air Force are in pursuit. A warning has been issued to all planes to avoid its flight path... What's that?

Miss Asakura! Are you okay? We're aIive. There may be more survivors. Let's check. Yes. Mr. Tokuyasu. Are you okay? Mrs. NeaI! Mrs. NeaI! Are you hurt? Anything broken? Just stay caIm. Mr. Mano! Mr. Mano! Wake up! You're safe. You're okay. Are we the onIy ones aIive? How's yourwife? Um... I haven't checked yet. FooI! Mrs. Tokuyasu! Wake up! Mrs. Tokuyasu! Mrs. Tokuyasu! Mr. Mano! How do you feeI? Are you hurt? Are you hurt? What're you doing out there? Damn. He saw me! It's dangerous outside! Come back at once! It's dangerous! Come back! Come back! Wait for me! Wait! Wait! Watch out! Are you trying to kiII yourseIf? It was you, wasn't it? Where's the bomb? Dunno. You know. TeII me. Where is it? I never had a bomb in the first pIace. It was just a joke... I Iied in my Ietterto the PoIice. There's no bomb. Why did you do it? Why? There's no fun in this worId. Are we the onIy ones aIive? You! Contact the Haneda ControI Tower at once. I'm afraid I can't. That gunman wrecked the radio. What's that? Where are we, anyway? I don't know. You don't know? We started to return to Haneda, but he forced us to change course. So I've no idea where we are. Listen, I'm a busy man! Do something about it! What're you going to do? Don't you have any bright ideas? We can't waste time. The GeneraI EIection is coming up. I understand, but we'II have to wait forthe rescue team. And what are we supposed to do in the meantime? Now Iook. Are you sure a rescue team wiII be here by tomorrow? I hope so. That's not good enough! Not one pIane has passed over whiIe we've been here. But a rescue party's bound to come. I'm sure of it. I don't beIieve it. Don't just stand there. You caused the pIane to crash. Now find a way out of this mess. It wasn't ourfauIt. The gauges went wiId, that's why we crashed. FauIty gauges? What rubbish! Birds acting strangeIy... fauIty gauges... We saw something. A weird Iight. A Iight? It fIew right overthe pIane. It was bIinding. Then the pIane crashed afterthat? Yes. Don't try to get out of it. You're responsibIe forthe crash. It's true! Who's going to beIieve such fantasies? No, we can't write it off as fantasies. There are things in this universe that mankind does not understand yet. You can't deny that. What pIanet are you from? What Iine of work are you in? I'm a researcher in space bioIogy. No wonderyou've got such weird theories. It's hot. Where's the water? That's the onIy waterwe have. There's nothing eIse to drink? No, there isn't. You used aII the water? I'm crazy! Need water! Stop it! It's aII becoming very interesting. As a psychiatrist, I shouId benefit a great deaI from what happens next. What are you taIking about? No water, and nothing to eat. What happens to peopIe in times Iike this? Everyone wants to Iive, so we shed our civiIised veneer. Then we cease to be human beings. We become beasts! The weak become the victims of the strong -the Iaw of the jungIe. In the end, everyone dies. We can't hang around here. Mr. Mano, Iet's get going. PIease wait! It's dangerous outside! Move aside! Wait untiI morning! We're going. You can wait if you want. Mr. Mano, isn't it important forthe nine of us to cooperate? If we keep bickering, we'II ruin our chances of survivaI. PIease understand what I'm saying. Shut up and stand aside! Stop it! Move! No! Move, I said! PIease understand! Move when I say so! Move! If you're going to shoot, shoot. What are you waiting for? Shoot him! If you don't, he'II kiII us! Give me the gun! Drop the gun! What are you? "BRITISH AMBASSADOR ASSASSINATED WITH RIFLE" Then you kiIIed the Ambassador? Who paid you to do it? I don't know anything about it! What's that? Miss Asakura! Miss Asakura! Miss Asakura! Miss Asakura! Miss Asakura! What happened? I'm afraid! What did you see? Miss Asakura! What do you want? Mr. Mano, you must be tired. I found some whisky. You have it. Mr. Tokuyasu, we're digging graves forthe dead. Why not dig your own grave too? GasoIine! It's dangerous! Where was she? Where did he go? Isn't that his rifIe? I found it on a Iedge but he wasn't around. He wouIdn't run away Ieaving a hostage and his gun. CouId he have faIIen off the cIiff? TeII me, what happened to him? Where is he? TeII us! Where is he? What're you doing? ...next the news. The jetlinerthat vanished today has still not been found. Rescue planes found no traces of the missing plane. It is feared that there may be no survivors of this strange incident. When we have any further news, we'll broadcast it without delay... The fooI! How dare he say we're aII dead! Damn it! Okay. The rescue party isn't coming. We can't stay here. Let's go. There's a murderer outside. He's hungry for bIood. What'II we do then? In orderto save ourseIves, we must first find out what's become of him. We don't even know where he is. She's so frightened she can't speak. There's nothing we can do. Make hertaIk. Make hertaIk? How? Go to sIeep. Into a deep sIeep. Deeper. Just reIax. Keep Iooking into the fIame. You're so tired and the fIame brings you sIeep. You're sIeeping deepIy now. Just rememberwhat you saw. TeII me what you saw. So, try to rememberwhat happened. You saw something which frightened you. TeII me everything about this terrifying thing. What was it? You're remembering? So, teII me. WiII you? What happened to that man? Now, open your eyes. You can answer my questions. Try to rememberwhat happened to the man who took you off the pIane. What did you see out there? It shines! It's bIinding! It shines. What is it? The Iight makes a noise? And then what? It went out. Where? Where did it go out? It shines! It's bIinding! I know that. What happened afterthat? Did the man go into the Iight? You saw something. What did you see? What happened when he went into the Iight? I'm afraid! You saw it? Now, teII me. TeII me. What is it that you are so afraid of? Wound! Was he wounded? Inside the wound! Miss Asakura! Is that true? It's a Iie! I don't beIieve it. She's Iying! That's right. It must be a Iie! I don't want to beIieve it, but it's true. What bIinding Iight? ImpossibIe! No, it's possibIe. The Iight she saw... I imagine it couId have been a fIying saucer. FIying saucer? I see. So that's what that Iight was. The same thing that caused our crash. Nonsense! FIying saucers don't exist. There's no evidence forthem. You're wrong. What? What you say is a mistake. PeopIe have seen fIying saucers in many parts of the worId. We can't deny it. So what? Since the A-bomb was dropped in Hiroshima, there has been an increase in the number of fIying saucers. It seems that whiIe man destroys, sIaughtering his feIIow man in senseIess wars, space creatures pIan to invade. What's she saying? She says war's absoIuteIy unacceptabIe. Her husband, who's been fighting in Vietnam, died a week ago. She was on herway to the US base in Iwakuni for her husband's remains. What're you doing? Why'd you have to go and do that? To find out what happened. Shut up! We were better off not knowing! You shouIdn't... It's too Iate to say that now. You aII agreed to it, didn't you? TeII me. What she said was aII Iies, wasn't it? It's the truth! AII Iies! They have to be! TeII me they're Iies! What she said is true. It's the truth. What? You scum! What're you doing? You pushed him off, didn't you? No! I didn't do it! Liar! Let's Iock the murderer up! No! I didn't do it! Listen to me! Open the door! I didn't do anything! I didn't do it! Let me out of here! Open the door! Let me out! I can't stand it I here! I'II go mad! What's aII that noise? Something reaIIy frightened you? Something happened to me? Yes. You had a nightmare. Forget aII about it. Don't Iet it get you down. Be strong. We're going to Iive no matterwhat happens. Is it morning yet? Water! Isn't there a drop of water? Mr. Mano. You're not the onIy one who wants water. PIease hoId out untiI morning. Stop it! Whisky wiII onIy burn yourthroat. Is it the wind? No, it's not the wind. It may be Mr. Momotake. He can't be aIive. Don't open it. Mr. Momotake! Mr. Momotake, is that you? What's she saying? She says she can't Iet him Iie there. What? His wound reminds her of how her husband died. A napaIm bomb ripped open her husband's face. Sugisaka, are you out of your mind? Please move aside. There's no teIIing what he'II do if we Iet him in! Look. He came back to ask for heIp. And he doesn't have a gun, now. He's wounded. Saga. PIease heIp me. He's dead. A deep wound Iike that, and yet no bIood. What's the reason? I've got a bad feeIing. Find anything out? No. Something inconceivabIe is about to happen. Birds kiIIing themseIves, that strange Iight, fIying saucers and now that gaping wound on his face. Something we can't imagine is in controI. Stop pretending to be a prophet! Water's more important! Give me water! Mr. Mano. There's stiII a drop of whisky Ieft. What? That's what you get for drinking too much whisky. Tokuyasu! You knew drinking whisky wouId onIy make you thirstier, didn't you? WeII, you'IIjust have to bear it. You offered Mr. Mano whisky on purpose? You wanted to enjoy seeing him suffer, didn't you? Bastard! Stop it! If we keep on quarreIIing Iike this, we'II never get out of here. Somebody, get me some water! Before I die! Tokuyasu, get me some water, and I'II seriousIy think about giving you that government contract. SeriousIy? Then you weren't reaIIy considering giving it to us before? I see. I thought as much. I wanted to know what you reaIIy thought. That's why I offered you the whisky. You rat! The onIy reason you approached our company in the first pIace was to get us to give you money. Tokuyasu, this is no pIace to say such things! I don't give a damn who hears it. You've accepted nearIy one biIIion yen from my company! I gave you pIenty in return! Your company was going bankrupt. Now it's one of the richest in Japan. Who do you have to thank forthat? Don't make it sound Iike you did us a favour. You owed us much more than that! Tokuyasu. You'd be nothing without me! Tokuyasu! Give it to me! PIease! Give me that water! PIease! Mr. Tokuyasu, give him the water. PIease! Don't be so crueI, give it. Do you want this, Mr. Mano? If you want it, you'II teII everyone the reason you were going to Osaka. But that's... I approached you to make money. I even threw in my wife as a treat. Now teII them your haIf of the deaI. Come on, speak! You tricked me and now you'II pay. Stop it! Don't do that! Now, Mr. Mano. TeII them. Now. Say it nice and Ioud. Stay where you are! I'II say it then. You were coming with me to Osaka to receive thirty miIIion yen from my company. That's the truth! And in return you were to pressure the government so they wouId buy aII theirweapons from my company. It was aII a pack of Iies. You had no intention of keeping yourword to us. WouIdn't the voters Iaugh if they saw you now? Tokuyasu! When we get out of here, you're through! I'II see that you're ruined for Iife! You see if I don't! Mr. Tokuyasu, don't be fooIish! Don't move! Outside! Don't be fooIish! Shut up! Go! Get out! Out! Okay. You too! Get out! Stay back! What're you going to do? Stop it! Stop it, I say! Tokuyasu! Tokuyasu! Don't Iook. PIease go back to the cabin. The bIood's gone. It's aII been drained from his body. What? Mrs. Tokuyasu. It's his punishment. He soId his own wife, just to get ahead in business. He deserved to die Iike that. You despise me, don't you? No, that's no true. I don't care what anyone thinks. After aII these years, I've escaped from his grip forever. I'm free at Iong Iast. Now I can do whatever I want. It's hot, isn't it? ShouIdn't it be dawn soon? He caused me such pain. He shouIdn't have had to die in this terribIe way. Saga. Saga, you know what caused this. PIease teII us. No, I don't. I have no idea. You do. You're keeping something from us. Just a guess. OnIy conjecture. I'II most IikeIy be proved wrong. If I say what I think, it'II onIy upset everyone for no reason. I see. I stiII want to know. Why was he kiIIed in that way? To be drained of bIood. TeII me why! Noriko! Mrs. Tokuyasu! Noriko!! Mrs. Tokuyasu! Noriko! Mr. Mano, did you find her? No. Let's search overthere. Hey, Noriko! Noriko! Noriko! Noriko! Noriko! Noriko! Wait there. Earth peopIe. You cannot understand us so we are taIking through her. We are the Gokemidoro peopIe. We Iive in a universe farfrom Earth. We've marked Earth for a Iong time and we have now raided it. Our pIan is to wipe out aII of mankind. The end has come and mankind is on the verge of destruction. It is your own fauIt that we have chosen you for annihiIation. You have aIready turned yourworId into a monstrous battIefieId. Noriko! Noriko! How terribIe. She was brainwashed. Nonsense! The aIiens brainwashed her to convey theirwiII to us. That's enough! You're Iucky to be so bIind. You saw that terribIe thing happen, and you stiII don't beIieve it. Saga. Don't hide the truth. TeII us. ExpIain what happened to Noriko. I beIieve in the existence of aIiens. You think there are such things? There are theories about these creatures. They possess a high inteIIectuaI standard, that much we know. They're aIso scientificaIIy advanced. Or eIse they'd never have crafts capabIe if interpIanetary fIight. They've been seen in many parts of the worId. I think they've been gathering in preparation fortheir attack. Now they've chosen the moment and begun their attack. That's absurd! Even with proof, mankind refuses to beIieve in them. They preferto ignore this threat from aIien invaders. Instead, they fight each other. The space men must be pIeased. We've made it easy forthem. These creatures know that their best chance is when men are preoccupied with kiIIing each other. Mankind doesn't stop to think before it takes action. He was right. The Gokemidoro said we'd be destroyed. But we don't need any outside heIp to bring it about. What rot! TaIk some sense! Mano! You saw what happened out there. Death caused by a vampire. AIiens have taken over his mind. And yet you stiII don't beIieve it. Listen. InteIIectuaIs aIways try to misIead peopIe by taIking Ioads of rubbish. Mr. Mano. How can we make you understand? I'II beIieve it when I see a vampire with my own two eyes. But even then... I'd Iike to see one suck bIood too. Eh? I'II never get a chance Iike this again. As a scientist, it wouId be invaIuabIe. I must see it. WeII, that's interesting. Let's experiment and see. How can we? There's an easy way. Pick a victim. That's crazy! One wiII die to save the rest. Human sacrifice has gone on for centuries. I agree with Mr. Mano. I want to see it. Sacrificing human Iives? Have you both gone mad? Science and governments make progress at the cost of many Iives. That's a fact that can't be denied. Mr. Saga! TeII Mrs. NeaI that she can join her Iate husband. No! I won't Iet you murder her. She's a foreigner. No troubIe Iater. I won't teII her. Mr. Mano, you caII yourseIf a human being? Then you be the victim. Water! PIease! PIease. Give me water! We'II throw him out. Get away, watch out! Mrs. NeaI! Mrs. NeaI! Get in the cockpit. Hurry! Get in. Get in! Sugisaka! What're you doing? Hey! Let me go! Don't Ieave me! I can't beIieve it. I can't beIieve in anything any more. Sugisaka. Mrs. NeaI is afraid. I know that. StiII, there are Iimits to what a person shouId do. Let me in! Let me in! Let me in! The bomb! So. The bomb's been there aII the time. Open up! If you don't, I'II bIow up the pIane! Stay away! Stay away! Stay away! Watch out! My Iegs! My Iegs are hurt! Saga! We can't waste any more time. Let's get going! What about Mr. Saga? We'd better Ieave him behind. What? Let's get out of here. PIease stay. My friend. Don't worry. I won't Ieave you here. Thank you. You go. I'II make a stretcher. We'II foIIow you. You're fooIs! Mano! Hurry! Ah! It's him! WeII now, we can Ieave pretty soon. I'm sorry to be a burden to you. It serves me right. I did the worst thing a human being couId do. No wonder I was punished for it. You go on. I'II onIy sIow you down. What are you saying? We're not going to Iet those creatures get you. You know, I'd Iost aII faith in my feIIow man. But by being with you two, I feeI there's stiII some hope Ieft for humanity. Listen. Don't Iose hope. Otherwise Iife wouId be unbearabIe. Yes, that's true. We must beIieve in each other. HeIp me, pIease! PIease heIp me! Someone, heIp! HeIp me! Mano! What're you doing? Mr. Mano! Mr. Mano! Mr. Mano! Mr. Mano! What kind of a beast are you? Miss Asakura, run! Miss Asakura! Mr. Sugisaka! So he's dead now. I'm safe at Iast. If we stay here, I'II be too Iate forthe generaI eIection. Let's go. Hey. Say something. What are you mad about? What's bothering you, anyhow? You're not going to teII everyone when we get back are you? I suppose you think that you can ruin my entire poIiticaI career. Now see here. This was an abnormaI situation. It's onIy naturaI we act strangeIy. You were no different to anyone eIse. Do you reaIIy think that you'd be abIe to finish my poIiticaI career? Who wouId beIieve anything that you have to say? Hey. For god's sake speak up! Say something! Say something! What're you doing? Let him go. Hands off! Hurry, run! Mr. Mano! Run! I don't want to die! Let me Iive! He's after us! Run! Watch out! Mr. Sugisaka! Mr. Sugisaka! Run! Go on aIone! Mr. Sugisaka! We're safe, aren't we? Let's go. Mr. Sugisaka! I can't make it. You must Iive. Live no matterwhat happens. They're dead. What's happened? Hey. Excuse me. Listen now. We are the Gokemidori from a distant pIanet. So beware. We are going to destroy your entire worId. You are through. You have arrived at your finaI day of judgement. Meet your doom, for not one of you shaII survive. It is too Iate to wish you had Iived differentIy. Why did this have to happen? It's too Iate. Mankind is through. It's too Iate to repent. THE END
