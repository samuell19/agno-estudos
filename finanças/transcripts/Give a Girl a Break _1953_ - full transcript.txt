Give the dogs a break. They've only had the part two days. Come on, Mustard. Turn around. Turn around. Mustard, turn around. 'Please, anybody that's in the sketches' 'will you please go down to the smoking room. Please!' - That's all. Just five yachts. - Five will be enough? No, no, that's for Ms. Hallson. Yo! 'Please, Ruth, Delmira, Joe, let's go.' Anybody in the sketches, please, down to the smoking room. Oh, Mr. Belney. Mr. Sturgis, here's your lunch. Put it there, and get Janet Hallson. - Okay. - Now. Ted, Ted, this is terrible. Where are the girls? Leo, this is Janet Hallson's big entrance. I want just the one girl, and all the rest boys. - It'll be great. - Wonderful! Ted, for Janet's entrance, I've got the full orchestra. Violins, flutes, oboes, brass, timpani, drums. Leo, it should be absolutely silent. Just the hand claps. - It will be sensational. - You're absolutely right. Now, we'll build this into a big climax. The guys all spread out and disappear, and there she is. Well, where is she? She's in the dressing room and Mr. Jordan would like to speak to you. Uh-oh. Take ten minutes. Get some cigarettes, Bob. Yes. Well.. I'm afraid that if we want to keep our star an apology is in order. - For what? - Does it matter? No. Janet, may we come in? Ted Sturgis is here. He'd like to apologize. Wouldn't you, Ted? I finish a number and what happens? Does he say anything? Oh, no. It's okay. Okay! Clear the stage. Let's get on with the next. Not a word to me, the star of the show. - Treats me like a chorus girl. - Janet, I know that... I've worked with the biggest people in the business! I don't have to take this. I've got managers begging me. This morning they called me from London, give me anything I like. We know that, Janet. We know. And Ted feels terribly that you should be upset even for a minute. Does he? Look, Janet, I couldn't be sorrier. I wouldn't have this happen for the world. I think you're a great artist. You-you're great. Just great. The way it is, the number was great. Honey, I got a show to put on. Just got so many weeks, no time to stop and palaver over people. Palaver? Listen to him! This Johnny-come-lately! This, oh.. He goes, or I go. Make up your mind. Janet, don't talk like that. No one is going to go. Oh, no? Fanny! Now wait a minute. A contract is a contract. Sue me. Linda Marlick. She'd be perfect. Wonderful voice. Magnificent personality. She can dance rings around the others. Doesn't know her left foot from her right. Calls herself a dancer. It's embarrassing to watch her. Besides, she's rehearsing down the street already. Anybody that's any good is set this late in the season. Ted, how about your ex-partner? She can really dance. 'It'd be a big story, the two of you together again.' How about her? She's out of the business. She quit. Maybe she's ready to come back. Why not give her a try? I tell you, she quit. Hey, how about Hollywood? There ought to be a star out there. You could fly out. Hey, do you know what I think, Mr. Sturgis? - Bobby, go for coffee, will ya? - Yes, sir. - Listen, do we need a star? - Of course, we need a star. - Who says so? - That's what I wanna know. This town's jumping with talented kids. Someone unafraid to work, who I didn't have to palaver over. - That word again. - I'd make you a star. You'd have a name to put up in lights after the show opened. I saw a girl three weeks ago. If we could get... - We haven't time for auditions. - Just give me 24 hours. You're not gonna get any star before then. Just give me 24 hours and I guarantee I'll come up with something. Or phone the agents. Get the newspapers to lend us a story. You're crazy. Give this to the newspapers you'll be swamped with girls. That's exactly what I want. If I could think of this girl's name. I want you to call the newspapers. Give them this item.

Uh, now as you can see, it'll be quite impossible for Ted Sturgis and myself to see all of you dance. However, we do want to be completely fair. But if you're not both a dancer and a singer you're just wasting my time and your time. What do they want? Jane Powell and Nero rolled into one? ..any professional experience will you dropout? Thought they're gonna give a girl a break. Now, that'll be the day. ...both ballet and tap.. Just get in line, and I-I'll be with you in just a minute. - Hey, where you going? - I haven't got a chance. - How can you say that? - Well... Matter of fact, if you ask me you got the best chance of 'em all. I have? I got it. Look, you wait right here. I'm gonna tell Ted about ya. But you don't know anything about me. Well, maybe we could take that up later. - Don't run away on me, now. - No, I won't. Look at them. Ever see such beautiful girls? Yeah, but have they got talent? Only important thing in the world. If a girl's got talent, she need not be good looking. She could be real ugly. - Not in this show, she can't. - You said it. - Oh, Mr. Sturgis... - Bob, go for cigarettes. - But, Mr. Sturgis... - And get Bremlick. Tell him to call or come. No rehearsals, costume fittings. Yes, sir. But there's a girl here, a wonderful girl. Just see her, I'm sure... - Later, Bobby, later. - Thanks. And now, there's one. Third from the right. That's my girl! That's her! Excuse me. What's your name? - Joanna Moss. - That's it! I want you to meet Mr. Sturgis. I saw your recital. It was wonderful. But I couldn't remember your name. I looked in all the back papers. Watch out. Ted, this is Miss Moss. The one with the recital. How are you? I told him about the wonderful reviews. The Times said, "It was sheer enchantment..." - That was the Tribune. - That was the Tribune. The Times said, "It was the dawn of a new era in the art of the dance." I still owe $475 on it. It was worth. After all, a dancer can't dance in a vacuum. Can she? Wouldn't you like me to show you my... No, no, I-I really... I have plenty of time. I came prepared to... No no, please. I-I have all these other girls. Won't you give me a chance? Yes. Not right now. I want you to meet Mr. Jordan. - Come upstairs to my office? - Thank you. Uh, Oh, Miss Moss, your, uh, your slip is showing. Ted, didn't I tell you she was exactly what we're looking for. I'll take her up. Huh? There she is, Mrs. Sturgis. Well, an awful little girl, for such a big part. How much experience have you had? Well, I-I haven't had any. Well, that's-that's just what's so wonderful, you see. She's not one of those, those tired faces you've seen around in musicals and nightclubs. I'm sorry. I was afraid, but Mr. Daler told me he telephoned you and you... - Jim Daler? - Yes. You must be little Suzy Doolittle. Why didn't you say so? I want Mr. Jordan to meet you. Will you wait upstairs in my office? You better make it Mr. Jordan's outer office. Thank you. Thank you. You know what I think? I think... She's exactly what we're looking for. Yeah. Sorry to keep you waiting. It just got through. Have I still got a chance? You certainly have. I've just had a 152 no's. I'll be with you in a minute. I've got to see Mr. Jordan. Sorry to keep you waiting. Gotta see Mr. Jordan. - Be with you in a minute. - It's in the bag. 'You'll have four numbers.. Oh, Ted.' 'Isn't this a wonderful surprise?' 'Miss Corlane said she's ready to work again.' 'I was telling her about the numbers you've worked out.' Madelyn, we should find another spot for you in the middle of the second act. Don't you think so? Did you tell Ms. Corlane we're opening in three weeks. That's pretty short notice for anyone who's been out of the business so long. I've never stopped working, not for a day. You only have to look at it to see that. Okay, then she'd care to audition for us tomorrow? - Ted, aren't you being silly? - The others are doing it. I'm perfectly willing to audition. After all, it's been a long time since Mr. Sturgis has seen my work. When do you want me? - I'm calling them at 10:00. - 10:00? 10:00 it is. Thank you very much for remembering me. Oh, this way please. - See you tomorrow. - I'll be right with you. Ted, can't we forget about the other girls? Isn't she exactly what we want? Those kids've been knocking themselves out for this chance. They worked, slaved, starved. What's she been doing for two years? Having herself a good time! Alright, alright. We'll see all three. Ted, you're a doll! I'll tell Joanna. I'll tell Suzy. Well, goodbye. Don't have to say good luck. You don't need it. Your name's gonna be right up there. And I'm gonna be the proudest manager in New York. - Goodbye. - Thank you. You don't have to worry about the others. Take my word for it. Keep your fingers crossed for me. I will. I'll keep my fingers crossed and my eyes crossed and my heart crossed. Besides, it's not necessary. It's in the bag. - Do you really think so? - I know so. Ted and Felix, the boys, they always trust my judgment. It's too good to be true. Bye. - Don't forget our date? - As if I could. Bye. Now don't be nervous about tomorrow. They haven't got a chance. You're gonna win it hands down. - If only I could believe that. - But I'm telling you you are. I've got a little say around here, you know. I'm telling you you've got the part. Oh, I can never thank you enough. Oh, Ted, about Madelyn Corlane I didn't mean to spring her on you that way. Oh, that's okay. Whatever happened between you two? Oh, I guess it was the same old thing, Felix. I, uh, wouldn't palaver over her, and, uh she found somebody who would. She seemed very anxious to work. Didn't you think so? Did she know I was gonna do the show? Yes. Mr. Sturgis, Mr. Belney would like to see you. Did she know it before she came? Yeah, she knew it before she came. Hmm. Come on. Ted, you've done it again. You said you'll come up with something good and you certainly did. We're in business. Listen to this one. Leo, we're in trouble. You know we haven't got Janet Hallson anymore. You know we've to write new songs, new dialogues new sketches, new orchestrations, new costume.. We've to paint a new sign in front of the theatre. Teddy, it's a cinch. Listen to this one. Leo. We'll never make it. We'll never make it. Hmm? Oh, uh. Wait a minute. This is show business. There's nothing you can't do in show business.

We'll go to the studio, and get Mr. Daler to work out something for your audition. Well, hurry, Suzy. Hurry, Suzy, don't waste time. I can't go now. I have a date. A date? I have to change my dress because I'm meeting him at 5:00. Who is this boy? Oh, he's not a boy, mother. He's a man. A very important man in Mr. Jordan's office. And I'm meeting him at the corner drug store. Oh! Suzy. You want to break your mother's heart? Oh, mum, this is so crazy. I'm old enough to have a date. The greatest opportunity in your life. And all you can think about is the date. Is this what I quarreled with your father for? That I gave up an eight room house for? Golly! Other girls go out with boys. You're not like other girls. You have a gift. It's time enough to think about boys when you're 25 or 30. Twenty-five? I'll be dead by then. Well, if you won't think about me, think about Mr. Daler. For two years he's given you lessons free. Absolutely free, so you could get a chance like this and pay him back. You talk as if I were giving up dancing. I'm gonna do my best to get that part tomorrow. Only way you're getting it is to work. Now, this afternoon we're going to work and work. And we're not going to think about anything else. Then, maybe tonight? Tonight we do our manicure, our hair. We have a light supper, a hot bath and a good massage and we're in bed by 10:00. Alright. Alright, but you know it's gonna happen, don't you? We're gonna be an old maid. Burton! Burton! Burton! Burton! Burton, are you in there? Peter! Oh, Peter! Peter, have you seen my husband? I've gotta get hold of him. - Has anything happened? - I've got a job, I think. - You have? - I'm gonna be in a Jordan show. - Where could Burton be? - Do they need a pianist? Margo! - Margo, have you seen Burton? - No. I'm gonna be in the Jordan show. You know Leo Belney, the famous composer? He's mad about my work. Burton! Oh, I'm looking for my husband. I've gotta get a hold of him. I saw him leave about an hour ago. Do you know where he was going? It must have been important. He was wearing his tie. I gonna star in a Broadway revue. They're writing a ballet especially for me. Isn't it wonderful? What about your job at the store? - Oh, I gave it up. - You think I could get it? Burton! - Darling. Darling. - Hi. Where you been? I tried to get you at the store. - Listen to what happened. - Have I got news for you! ...compose a song, and he's mad about my work. You're not listening. I'll be the head of the music department at a university. I guess you didn't hear me. I'm gonna be the star. The star of a Broadway show! I've been with the trustees, they liked me. They'll give me a free hand. I'll teach composition, conducting. In Gooseneck, Minnesota. - Gooseneck? It's not Gooseneck. - Hmph. It's a perfectly good town of 80,000 people. The way you talk, you'd think there's no place but New York. For an artist, there's no other place. Oh, baby, you haven't heard the whole proposition. They're giving us a house. We'll live like human beings. Why, we'll even have a kitchen. I'm not leaving here. You have no right to ask me. Ask you? Joanie, what's gotten into you? Isn't this the chance we've both been waiting for? What about my chance? I have a career, too. Well, seems to me that teaching kids is a lot more important than hopping around on your toes in a Broadway show. Since we no longer have a language in which we can communicate it would be intolerable to be confined in this small space with you. Now, where're you going? Home, to my folks, in Montclair. Oh? Well, I'll save you the trouble. I'll go home to mine. In the Bronx. I, uh.. I forgot my tie. Have you, uh.. Have you seen my tie? No. Oh! Now, what are we fighting for? Maybe neither of us will get the job. Hi, darling. I'm sticky. I've been doing my daily dozen. You forgot your costume for the party tonight. I went to the shop to pick mine up. They said you didn't come in for your fitting. - I'm sorry, I forgot. - You better try it right away. They're keeping a fitter in case there's something to do. I thought maybe I wouldn't go tonight. We don't have to stay. If the party's dull, we go someplace else. Anson, what would you say if I told you I want to go back on the stage? I went to see about a job today. Madelyn. Forget the theatre. Marry me. Marry me, and we'll go abroad. There's so many places I want to take you. So many things to see. I told them I'd audition tomorrow. They asked you to audition? Like any beginner? Everyone does it nowadays. What's the show? If you don't mind, I'd, I'd rather not say. Well, it's bad luck to talk about a job till it's settled. Darling, don't do this. If they really wanted you, they wouldn't ask you to audition. You'd go there and put yourself on a par with the others. It doesn't do any good. It does you harm. Suppose they tell you no. Don't subject yourself to this humiliation. You're pretty discouraging. I don't want you to be hurt. Now, you're tired. Sleep for an hour, I'll pick you up at 9:00. Oh, Mr. Sturgis? Your cigarettes. You don't think you'd be needing me anymore tonight, do you? Not tonight, Bobby. Well, then, if you don't mind, I got a date. With a girl "who's exactly the girl we're looking for"? Yeah. Would it be alright if I told her what you said? I mean... that she might be it. Tell her she's got the same chances as the other two. I know. Other one. Miss Corlane? Well, she's backed out, she left word with Mr. Jordan. Why? Did she say why? No, just that she thanked him and that she wouldn't be there tomorrow. Oh, that's fine. That's great! I've worked out new routines for her, and now she's quit again. - Well, uh.. - I should have know. As long as you won't be needing me.. ...like I said, I got a date. So long. - Suzy, wha... - Shh-h. Wha-what happened? I held a stool at the drugstore for you for an hour and a half. I might as well be a prisoner. My mother wouldn't let me come. I feel terrible about you waiting there alone but there wasn't anything else to do. Ah, it doesn't matter. One night doesn't matter when I'm gonna see you every night from now on. Come on, you've worked enough. Oh, I have to go home. Mother's making dinner for me. I-I'm sorry I cant ask you. Oh, that's okay. I had five banana splits. The guy behind the counter kept, kept looking at me kinda funny so I had to keep ordering. Come on, get your things, I'll walk you home. I know the perfect way to go. - What way is that? - Slowly. Well, Suzy, there it is. That's exactly what I was trying to explain to the boys down at the theater. I don't know. If they just listen to me more often they wouldn't get themselves into those jams. If anybody back home had told me I'd be out walking with a theatrical man, well.. Where is back home, Suzy? Monroe City, Missouri. Where are you from? - Oh, Dickinson, Montana. - Golly! Funny thing, you know. I've been kinda figuring this out. Got it pretty well figured. Almost everybody in New York City comes from someplace else. You know what I mean? Now, back home it's different, see. They don't come to Dickinson they're there because well, they're born there. You know what I mean? I never thought about that. You know what? I'll bet, I'll bet you could walk around New York City for one hour, one hour.. ...and you could find somebody from every state in the union every country in the world. You know what I mean? Right here. Can you imagine? Suzy.. ...you don't know how wonderful it is to meet someone like you. Someone I can... converse with. That's the way I feel, too. Everything's so crazy nowadays that there's so many things I'd like to ask you. Thing's I couldn't talk to my mother about.

Okay, I won't stay a minute, I wanted to tell you you're not giving up that audition tomorrow morning. - No? - No. So be at the theater at 10:00 sharp. Really, this is a little ridiculous. Don't give yourself any airs. I know you well, remember? Madelyn Newspickle. You were a butterfly in Miss Caxley's annual recital. The pride of Tulsa. You're very merry all of a sudden. Quite a change. I was mad as a wet hen, when I walked in the office this morning and saw you sitting there cool as a cucumber. Condescending to honor the theater with your presence. But when I heard you so sweet and penitent I said to myself, maybe there's some good in her after all. Let's give the poor little girl a break. Please, will you go? I'm not gonna audition tomorrow, and that's final. Madelyn, look, if it's me I promise you... Oh, you flatter yourself. It has nothing to do with you. What was it? What made you change your mind? It was a silly impulse, and I though better of it. Began to think those rehearsals all day, all night the work. The hours, for what? I'm perfectly happy as I am. Don't try to kid me. Why have you kept on practicing? Why have you kept at it day after day? So you could go to a fancy dress ball? I know you. This kind of thing isn't your dish. You belong in the theater. You need the theater as much as it need you. What's the use, Ted? You know I haven't got a chance. Ah. Now we're getting down to it, ah? You're scared. Don't you know you can dance circles around those kids. You just have to keep dancing, and dancing, and dancing. Got the jitters, that's all. The best dancer I ever knew. Come on give me your hand. One, two, three, four. Left, right, left. That's it. Now, come on, let's go. Let it go. One, two, double it. A one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, go. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One and two, three, four. What's the matter? You're tired already? Charming. Charming. I'll expect you tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock. And don't let anybody talk you out of it. Especially Prince Charming. Well, that was quite an exhibition. If you don't mind, Anson, I'd rather not go tonight. I've never asked anything of you before, Madelyn. This is one thing I think I have a right to ask. I couldn't bear it if you went back into the theater. I couldn't be a stage door Johnny. Madelyn, did you hear? Yes, I heard. Well, what are you gonna do? I don't know, Anson. I just don't know. Good morning. - How are you? - Hi. - Hi. - You all set? - Suzy? - Huh? I said, are you all set? - Well, I'm dying of fright. - There's no sense in that. That's what I say. Oh, this is my mother. Thought it was. How are you, Mrs. Doolittle? Bobby'll show you your dressing room. - He will? - Come on. - Good luck. - Oh, thank you. You look wonderful! - You think so? - Just wonderful! Oh, there you are Mrs. Doolittle. Good morning. You know, Ted, I used to act just like that Bobby. - Attentive, eager... - Good morning. I'm not late am I? There was a subway jam. No, there's plenty of time. Bob will show you a dressing room... I'll take her. - Good luck. - Oh, thank you. There's nothing to be frightened about. I'll be there pulling for you. Don't get excited, don't get nervous. Just take it easy, relax. I mustn't. I can't relax for a minute Not for a second. You'll be a dead duck. Go in, and knock 'em for a loop. Good luck. - Well, thanks. - Come on, Ted. 'No use waiting. If she isn't here, she isn't coming.' Come on, Ted. Well, you came. I wasn't sure. Yes I came. I haven't slept a wink, but I'm here. I'll put you on last, so you won't have to rush. It would be better to get it over with quickly. Don't talk that way. Just remember what I said last night. - Good luck. - Thanks. Bravo. - House lights, Bob. - House light. And please, I'd like to see all three girls on stage. Well, Miss Moss, Miss Doolittle. If you please. Mr. Jordan would like to see you. Right over there. It's in the bag. I wanna to thank you for giving me the chance to see your work. 'You're fine performers, all of you.' My problem is that I need only one of you. 'And that is a problem.' 'Which one?' You're all so good, you'd all be an asset to the show. Before I decide, I must consult the others. When we reach a decision, I'll phone you. Mr. Jordan, you'll phone either way? Either way, and thank you. - 'Thank you.' - 'Thank you.' Oh, Mr. Jordan, forgive me. But the telephone's in the hall and sometimes there's some confusion. So when you telephone, would you ask for Mrs. Bradshaw? - That's my married name. - Your married name? - You're married? - Yes, I thought you knew. No... no. Oh, dear. - Tough luck, Romeo. - I still think she's the best. - Bob Dowdy. - 'Coming.' Felix, listen. How can you have any doubts? There's no question about it, Madelyn's our girl. I would have settled for her yesterday, but now. Well, maybe I sound disloyal to Madelyn but, I don't know. They're all three so good. You can't beat the Moss girl. She's okay for me too, and little Suzy Doolittle. She's wonderful, I'm willing to settle for Suzy right now. - Bob, go for coffee, will you? - Wow! Yes, sir. Hey, wait, wait. May I have a word with the future Broadway star. Oh, is it true? Didn't take me long to convince them of that. - Thank you! - You boy! Mr. Jordan's waiting for me to get back. We gotta get busy on our plans. I'll see you soon as the conference is over. What did I tell you. Isn't he wonderful? Oh, wait till I tell your father. I don't agree with you. Felix, listen to me. If I thought Madelyn wasn't good or better than two years ago. - I wouldn't be yelling. - Joanna Moss has got something. It's getting over and above the rest. She's got style, intelligence. She's great for modern dance, but what about the comedy stuff? I'll write new ones. I can write for Joanna Moss. The only one who can do it all 'who can handle all the dances is Madelyn.' 'Madelyn.' We've only got three weeks. I want a professional. Know what I think Mr. Sturgis... I know, I know, Suzy Doolittle. I've got to have a professional. Somebody who can pick it up fast and who knows routines. And that's just what you'll get, routine performance. Stop it! I've had all that I can stand. We're not getting anywhere. I'm going out. Now, think this thing over. Make up your minds. Come to some kind of a decision. Somebody's gotta compromise. ♪ Give a girl a break ♪ ♪ Give a girl a break ♪ ♪ Give my girl a break ♪♪ 'Suzy hailed as sensation.'

Ted. Well, have you come to a decision? Who's it going to be? There's just one way to settle this. We've been at this for eight hours now and no one has budged. So, we're going to write each girls name on a piece of paper. We're going to put all three names in a hat. We're going to draw out one and that is going to be the girl. You understand? - Alright. - Okay. Here. Operator, please, can't you get Monroe City? I've got to talk to Mr. Doolittle. It's my father and he's.. Just a minute. She's asking if we'll accept a call. - Someone's trying to get us. - I suppose so. Tell her to keep trying to get your father. Okay. Alright, operator. Hello, Suzy, this is Felix Jordan speaking. It's Felix Jordan. I called to tell you that after hours of exhaustive discussion I regret to say that we've decided to use someone else. I understand. Thank you for calling, Mr. Jordan. Goodbye. I didn't get the part after all. That boy said it was all settled. How could he? How could he? I'll never get the job. Never. There's only one man the composer was going for. - Then, the day he.. - Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Go on, honey. I'm listening. He found out I was married. Found out? Say, what's going on around here? Well, I knew he liked me, but I thought it was for my art. As one artist to another. Ah, there's your call. Go on, answer it. Oh, I can't. I'd cry. You answer it. Hello. Oh, yes, Mr. Jordan. No, this is Mr. Bradshaw, her husband. She asked me to take a message. A-ha.. Right. I'll tell her. Oh, I knew it. I knew it. Oh, what's the matter with you? You got the part. I got it? I got it? Isn't it wonderful? Isn't it marvelous? You see, it was my art he liked. I'm not gonna take your answer as final Madelyn. - Even if you get the part... - There's no even, if. They've got to take me. They need someone who can jump in there fast. Those girls can't do it. They haven't had the experience. Alright then. When do you get the part? You may still decide that you made a mistake... Hello, he..hello, daddy. Look, daddy. Daddy, listen... That's the door. Would you get it? Hello, daddy, I'm crazy to hear all about it but I'm expecting a terribly important phone call. - Can I call you back? - Oh. - Come in. - Thanks. 'I... I wanted to talk to you.' It's bad news. Yes, you didn't get it. 'It had nothing to do with your audition.' You were fine, fine, but afterward Well, I know it sounds ridiculous but.. We put all three names in a hat and we drew. I just wanted to say I-I did everything I could. It's alright. I'm sure you did. - I can't tell you how much I... - 'Who got the part?' - Joanna Moss. - She's lovely. 'Madelyn.' It was good of you, Ted, to come and tell me instead of telephoning. I know how busy you are bu-but it really doesn't matter. The whole thing was a silly impulse. It doesn't matter, one way or the other. Good bye, Ted. Good luck. I'm sorry. Truly sorry. I can't say you didn't warn me. I'll call you later. 'You're very sweet, Anson, but I'm afraid I won't be here.' I'm going away. 'Where?' Where all dancers go when they're washed up. Home. Back home and open up a dancing school. Brag to all the little monsters what a glorious and happy career I've had. Goodbye, Anson. Okay, here we go. Now, we got four counts for nothing. You come in, in the first count of eight. Alright? And one, two, three, four. One, two, three, four, five, six seven, eight. Two, two, three, four, five, six seven, eight. Two, two, three, four, five, six seven, eight. Take up the curtain. Hold it! hold it! What is this? Where is Joanna Moss? - Where is she, Bobby? - I called her, Mr. Jordan. - Well, where is she? - She's in the dressing room. She's crying and she won't come out. Don't look at me. I've been milk and honey. Take ten minutes. Joanna, do you realize that you're holding up an entire company, 87 people. Time and overtime? - You alright, Joanna? - He's walking out on me. Darling, I'm doing no such thing. This is a fine time to pull a stunt, upsetting the girl. - Goodbye, baby. - Oh, no. Look, why don't you postpone this scene for another time? Because I've a train to catch. I'm due in Minnesota on Monday. Now, darling. It'll only be for a couple of weeks. - Then you can join me. - What do you mean? This show isn't gonna fold. It'll be a hit. You'll could get another husband but you won't get this part. - Why, you cheap... - No, no, no, hold it. We're all very tired and nervous. Let's forget this and get back to rehearsal. No. I've changed my mind. - She's coming with me. - Oh, darling. Well, there's a little matter of contract. Joanna has a run-of-the-play contract. She's gotta to go on. You've all been terribly sweet. You too, Mr. Belney. But it wouldn't be really worthwhile. You see, I'm gonna have a little act of God. Mr. Bradshaw, I ought to punch you right in the nose. Listen, Suzy. I got the... Do I have to keep telling you? - I never want to see you again. - Listen, Suzy, please... You lied to me. Unforgivable lie. - Ah, Suzy, could I help if... - I'm not listening to you. The job is yours. Joanna quit. She's gonna have a baby. - I don't believe a word. - What's he saying? - Is it true? Has she left? - I'm telling you. - Joanna's out and Suzy's in. - I am? You have to be at the theater early tomorrow morning. - Goodbye. - Oh, Suzy, isn't it wonder... Oh, Suzy, I've got to admit it. He's a lovely boy. A man, mother. A man. Oh, Suzy. Mr. Sturgis, anything I can do for you? Bobby, where have you been? Call the papers. Have them get the photographers in the morning. Madelyn's gonna jump into the part. You know what that means? Corlane and Sturgis are back together again. Oh, baby. Now, we're really in business. Boom, boom, ba-boom. I see, you heard the news, eh? Well, cheer up. It's not as bad as all that. I don't know. The way I feel now, my life is over. I might just walk out and never to be heard of again. That's right. A man can't take it. That girl Joanna throwing away a chance like that. A chance to sing my song, dance my music. I tell you, this is the end. I'm through with women. - I am through. - Yeah? I'm through with Suzy. - It's all over between us. - No, when did that happen? Any minute now. But at least one of us is happy. Ted. Ted is positively delirious. He's walking on air. I... couldn't find her. She's gone. Apartments closed up, no forwarding address. No nothing. Nobody knows where she is. No kidding. I guess, you win. Go tell your girl she's got the part. I don't need to. I already told her. I'll tell her again. ♪ Applause applause ♪ ♪ We like applause because ♪ ♪ It means we made a striking ♪ ♪ As the audience is liking us ♪ ♪ Our work demands ♪ ♪ You don't sit on your hands ♪ ♪ And if the hands commend us ♪ ♪ You send us ♪ ♪ We live we thrive ♪ ♪ You keep us all alive ♪ ♪ With bravo and bravissimo ♪ ♪ We're dead if it's pianissimo ♪ ♪ Art work is work ♪ ♪ Is work we never shirk ♪ ♪ In a happy land of tinsel and Gods ♪ ♪ Because ♪ ♪ We like applause ♪ ♪ Whether you're a cymbal ringer ♪ ♪ Or a crooner ♪ ♪ Or a singer ♪ ♪ Or monologist ♪ ♪ Ventriloquist ♪ ♪ Or a dog act ♪ ♪ Or a magician ♪ ♪ Or a musical for musician ♪ ♪ Or an ingenue ♪ ♪ Organist who is hot ♪ ♪ Whether you play Punchinello ♪ ♪ Little evil ♪ ♪ Or a fellow ♪ ♪ Having heard the call you've given all you've got ♪ ♪ And what better reward for a trooper ♪ ♪ Than the star we consider super ♪ ♪ Applause applause ♪ ♪ Vociferous applause ♪ ♪ From orchestra to gallery could mean a raise in salary ♪ ♪ Give up give in ♪ ♪ Be noisy like a kid ♪ ♪ The manager the artist ♪ ♪ Are boys ♪ ♪ We're going out of town ♪ ♪ Because we cannot run away ♪ ♪ We earn applause along the way ♪ ♪ If we come through give credit where it's due ♪ ♪ Let the major theaters operate ♪ ♪ Because ♪ ♪ Because ♪ ♪ Because ♪ ♪ Because we like applause ♪ ♪ Bravo bravo bravissimo ♪ ♪ Bravo bravo bravissimo ♪ ♪ Bravo hurray bravo hurray bravissimo hurray ♪ ♪ Bravo hurray bravo hurray bravissimo hurray ♪ ♪ Bravo hurray bravo hurray bravissimo hurray ♪ ♪ Bravo hurray bravo hurray bravissimo hurray ♪ ♪ Bravo hurray bravo hurray bravissimo hurray ♪ ♪ Because because ♪ ♪ Because we like applause ♪♪ - Suzy. - Bobby. Papa. Momma. Oh, Ted. This is my father, Ted. You should be a very proud man. - She's wonderful. - Thank you. Ted, where.. - Darling, you were wonderful. - Truly, truly remarkable. Ted... Ted. Maddy. Maddy, where have you been? I've been worried about you. We wanted you for the show. Oh no. Suzy, was wonderful. But not as wonderful as you would have been. Why did you disappear that way? Why did you run away? I wanted to find out something... and I did. It wasn't the stage I wanted to come back to. - It was you. - Oh, Maddy, Maddy.
