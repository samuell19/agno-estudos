My name is Ever Wong... ...and this is Chagrin Falls, Ohio, maybe the most uneventful suburb to exist. My parents immigrated here from Taiwan 22 years ago. This is them. Cute, right? Twenty-one years ago, they had me. Wait, hold on. That's better. I don't think they made it out of that hospital before planning every single moment of my existence. The center of their world. I don't really like being the center of anything, though. Maybe because when you look like this in a town that looks like this, attention seems to find you. But all this planning was for one purpose... Ever Wong, MD. Now that I'm heading to med school, I thought I'd finally have a break. But instead, my parents decided to send me to summer school... in Taiwan. ♪ Feel like I just woke up From a two-year nap ♪ ♪ Everything's been So strange ♪ ♪ But I woke up Now I'm finally back ♪ ♪ Feeling myself And seeing things ♪ ♪ I never used to notice ♪ ♪ Life don't look So hopeless now ♪ ♪ I'm clicking my heels And I'm skipping my feet ♪ ♪ Everything seems so new ♪ ♪ It's like I'm me ♪ ♪ But with a whole new piece ♪ ♪ Never thought I'd come through ♪ ♪ But now I know That all the dark times ♪ ♪ Only make the light shine ♪ The school is called the Taiwan Study Tour in Huwei. An intensive eight-week program filled with immersive language and history classes. Hey! Take it in, people. Taipei will be your home for the next eight weeks. I'm not sure if you're still on the plane, but this place sucks without you. And promise me you'll find time to rehearse. Hi. Hi. Counselor Mei-Hwa asked me to introduce myself to you because you're by yourself and not talking to anyone. Oh, um, uh, okay. I'm Ever. I'm Sophie Ha, like "ha-ha." What's that? It's nothing. Do you go to college? Um, yes. What are you studying? Oh, I-- I'm at Dartmouth for Computer Science. It wasn't my top choice, but, you know, an Ivy is an Ivy, right? So, where are you from? See, I'm from New York City. Actually, I grew up in New Jersey. Went to high school there after my parents divorced, which, I know, makes me tragically less interesting. So I just tell everyone I'm from New York City. So, are you excited for the summer? See any guys you like? Do you not like to talk? Um, I-- I'm at a four-year pre-med program in Chagrin Falls, Ohio. And, you know, I don't really know if "excited" is the right word. I haven't really-- Oh. Oh, okay. You're not excited to be here? This is obviously your first time coming to Huwei. Yeah, uh, where I grew up, I only knew, like, three other Asian kids. My, my parents wanted me to come, so I could see... Oh, my God. Boy Wonder. Boy Wonder? Are you like one of those manga geeks? Uh-- No, no. That's not my thing. That, that guy sitting over there, that's Rick Woo. Uh-huh? Like, the Rick Woo. He's been on the cover of the World Journal at least ten times. I have read every article about him. He's a piano prodigy. He also won the National Spelling Bee at age nine. Wow, this boy's the real deal. Sounds like someone has a crush. - Ever! - No, no, no. My mom... There's another feature on Rick Woo in the World Journal. ...has been obsessed with him since, like, forever. Looks like he's studying at Yale. Economics. Oh, and he's the star of a football team. Mm-hm. And so handsome. He's her ideal child, and she is constantly comparing me to him. You know, if anything, Rick Woo is the bane of my existence. He's my cousin. You're... You're messing with me. No, we are very much related. ♪ Oh, yeah, it's Taipei ♪ If this trip was attracting Boy Wonder-level talent, this program was gonna to be a lot. ♪ I feel like I can't take it ♪ You okay? Come on. Yeah. The-- the bag was stuck. Yeah, I saw that. Oh, no! I got it. Really, it's okay. I... No, don't worry. I got you. Rick! This is Ever. She's a big fan. What? No, no, no. I-- I am not a fan. She calls you Wonder Boy and talks about you all the time with her mom. Hey, you should ask Ever out. I mean, you're single, and she struggles with social skills and making friends and stuff like that. It's perfect. That's-- That's not-- I'm not-- I'm not actually-- He used to date this girl, Jenna. She's a model. But, of course, you would probably know that, being an obsessed super fan. You know, Ever is pre-med. So that's at least something. The Dragon is still here? Mm-hm. The what? The headmistress of Huwei. Head misery of Huwei. I thought she was going to retire last year. What is she saying? She just wants us to check in for registration. I-- I don't understand. If you two already speak Mandarin, why did your parents make you come? No one made us. Why would someone choose to spend their summer taking classes? I mean, it's Loveboat. Loveboat? I'm already lost. Why does everyone look so... This isn't the '90s, Ever. Everyone knows Asians are cool now. And this isn't summer school. This is Loveboat. See, you keep saying that, but I don't know what it means. Follow me. Parents send their kids here because they think it's a cultural program. But we're all here because we know what it really is. One big party. If it isn't Mr. Yale Superstar. All right, Stanford. Hey, what up? I'm David. - Ever. - Hi. - Hi. - Sophie, right? It's me, Spencer. Uh, we met in Forensics Nationals. Oh, hey! Hey, Rick, we're going to sign up for the bo staff. You in? Hell yeah, 100%. Let's do it. Catch you later, Ever. Bye... Rick. Okay, Boy Wonder wasn't the intense hyper-genius I expected. In fact, none of this was. I'm Sophie Ha, like "ha-ha." And this is Ever. Wong. Like... "Wong." Okay. Sophie and Ever. And you two want to room together? That could be fun. If this isn't summer school, why'd they give us so many books? You won't need them. Hey! Hold up! Stop! Wait, wait, wait! Okay, I think I know why they call it Loveboat. Surprise! What is it? You are going to Taipei. Tai-- Taipei? Like Taiwan? You leave Saturday. Wait, like this this Saturday? Yeah. We see how hard you've been studying and preparing for your medical school We want to give you something special, as a reward. Sometimes, we put too much pressure on you to follow in your father's footsteps. We know that, so... You have your whole life to work. But now you're just 21 years old, and we think you deserve to have some fun. Which is why we're sending you to Huwei. Think about it, it's going to be the perfect summer. Eight weeks of Mandarin, calligraphy, and Chinese medicine. And it's a highly competitive program to get into. Learning the language will look great on your resume. I think you're going to love it here. Don't worry, I'm gonna make sure you get the full Loveboat experience. Now be honest, what do you think of this dress? Oh, it-- it looks great. I know. So, why'd you fly halfway around the world if you don't even want to be here? It was my parents' idea. I get that. Everyone comes here because of their parents. At least the first time. I mean, it's not like I don't want to be here. It's just, I was really hoping that I'd get into this dance company. Fun. I love to dance. A group of us are going to hit up the clubs later tonight. You want to come? Oh, that's-- that's all right. I think I'm just gonna... - take it easy tonight. - Suit yourself. But maybe another night? Oh, don't worry. There'll be plenty of other nights. Don't wait up. The only place I've ever been able to shut off all the pressures of med school and just be myself is dance. When I'm moving, it's like... all the expectations melt away. I got offered an audition for a dance company in New York this summer. It's a long shot, but if I get accepted, I'd finally have the guts to tell my parents I want to hold off on med school and pursue it. Except now, I'm stuck in Huwei, with nowhere to rehearse or record my audition. ♪ Free your eyes Of what you see ♪ ♪ You know the secrets ♪ ♪ We told ♪ ♪ Remember the heartache ♪ ♪ They wrote ♪ ♪ I won't tell anything I know ♪ ♪ Underneath all the pain Endures ♪ ♪ Is gold ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Is gold ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Is gold ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Is gold ♪ That was good. How long have you been up there? Longer than you. I didn't mean to scare you. You didn't scare me. I just-- I-- I didn't think that there was going to be someone, like, on the roof, lurking in the shadows. Yeah, neither did I. I wasn't lurking, I was-- Twirling. That's not what I was... Don't be embarrassed. You're good. In a pirouette kind of way. You, you know what a pirouette is? Of course. Don't you? I'm Xavier. Ever. Ever do what? No, no, my-- My name is Ever. Forever Ever? So, what are you doing here anyways? You filming a TikTok or something? No. You just like to dance on rooftops? I was just... clearing my head. Yes, I like to dance. Yeah, I... I gotta go, but... Well... you have a good night, Forever Ever. Ev, how's Taiwan? Couldn't wait one day? You should have just smuggled yourself here in my suitcase. I can't help it. I'm miserable without you. All right, well, guess who's here. Boy Wonder. The gorgeous guy from the newspapers you save? My mom saves them. You know, I bet she knew that he'd be here. Maybe this is her delusional attempt at setting us up. Your mom is so extra. But also, he's hot. Are you gonna ask him out? Like I said, I have been here for one day, Megan. Maybe this trip is your chance to let loose for a change. Live a little. I mean... there was also this boy I met up on the rooftop when I was dancing. What? You were dancing with a boy on a rooftop? It must be that Spotify playlist I made you. It was nothing, Megan. I was just practicing my audition. I'm so glad you're still gonna to film that. How long do you have? I checked their website. I have seven weeks. Oh, that's good. I just have to find a studio, or someplace to practice my routine. Taipei's a huge city. There's got to be somewhere you could go. Yeah. Maybe. Hold on, I'll call you later. Keep me posted. Hey. Check this out. And don't forget, the student with the best dishes will be featured at our end-of-summer festival. What's the end-of-summer festival? Pretty much what it sounds like. They do it on the grounds outside. Lots of parents come. The whole entire neighborhood, really. Yeah, there's music, dancing, showing off shit we made, and basically everything we learned this summer. Dancing? Yeah, it's a whole thing. This is amazing. Mr. Woo, you can do it all. It's nothing, really. Wow. What are you always writing in there? Oh, it's just-- It's something that I do. Plan things. It keeps me accountable. Hm. Well, maybe you should add "have fun" to the list. Easy for you to say. You have things like ribbon dancing and fan-throwing classes. I'm signed up for all of the stupid stuff. Which is why you need to have some fun. And I mean outside of class. Oh, my God, yeah. Like going out clubbing - and hanging with the locals. - Exactly. Okay, what outfits did you bring? Um... Uh-- This. I guess I'm not really the "going out" type. Come on, Ever. You're telling me you're not gonna party while you're here? Not even once? Never? Never-Ever? Good one. Good one. Girl, you have to come. Well, actually, I was going to meet up with someone. Okay, well, that's a good start. But you're going to come clubbing after, right? Oh. Dragon coming in hot. Uh, what? I will repeat in English, so that I'm crystal clear. The curfew is 10 p.m. sharp, and that you are all to be in your rooms. No. I know, just don't listen to her. You are here to learn and experience your cultural heritage, not to go around the city doing whatever you please. Ten p.m., lights out. This is such bullshit. Yeah. Literally. Clubs don't even open till 10:00. Exactly. So, a little bit about my mom's sister, Auntie Shu. She's the coolest, craziest, artiest woman I've ever known. She spent her entire youth traveling around the world, all so she could find herself. She's awesome. She's everything I wish I could be. But unfortunately, everything I'm not. Where are you going? Out. What? What-- what about curfew? Hey, Ever, remember that crazy fun night when you followed the rules? Um... No. Exactly, because no one ever remembers those nights. - See you. - Okay, maybe Sophie and Auntie Shu had a point. Time to finally break some rules. Wait. Let me come with you. No, no. So they get to enjoy Loveboat and we don't? What now? It's cool. We got another way out. How are we supposed to get down there? Yo, check it out. Cabs. They knew we'd sneak out. Taipei coming in clutch. Surprised you're here. Sophie told me you weren't coming. Ooh. You think they saw us? I don't think so. Sorry. I wasn't complaining. What? Got to say, a week ago, I didn't think I was going to be in Taiwan sneaking out with-- Wonder Boy? I think that's... That's what you call me, right? Actually, it's Boy Wonder. Hm. I prefer Wonder Boy. What are you guys doing? Sorry, I just- I didn't expect to see people lurking in the shadows. Oh, it's all good. See? Yo, what's going on? Security guard. Oh, I can distract him. Who the hell is this guy? Xavier. Who the hell are you? Did you invite him? Looks like he's inviting himself. Hey, so where are we going? I know a spot, if you guys are down. All right, man, you don't have to act like a hero. Who's acting? Hey! Big man! Come on, come on, come on. Hey! The counselors. He needs help. Is that Never-Ever? Hey! ♪ They said "It's rocking When you're done" ♪ ♪ "You wanna do it all over again" ♪ He's always our hookup. He's my guy. Hey, hey. Where's Ever? I-- I don't know. Stop! COUNSELOR MEI-HWA Hey! Girl, why are you just standing there? Get in. That was insane. Taipei, baby. Let's go! ♪ You know I've got to go ♪ ♪ You know I've got to go ♪ ♪ Oh, Lord You know I've got to go ♪ ♪ You know I've got to go ♪ Okay, so I've got four spots lined up, including Xavier's. Excited, Ever? Oh, um, sorry. I-- I actually I have to get dropped off somewhere first. Oh, right. Your mystery meetup. Maybe I can catch up with you later? Okay. You sure you're good going alone? I mean, it's a new city and there's a lot of... people. I think I'll be all right. Thanks. Wow. This... This city is just... Incredible. Yeah. Check this out. Okay. ♪ I was looking for a place For answers ♪ ♪ I was looking for some Feeling for me ♪ ♪ But I didn't know What I really needed ♪ ♪ Till you came And you found it in me ♪ Oh, um, no, it's-- it's me, Auntie Shu. Ever? Your niece. That doesn't make any sense. Why would my niece be delivering food? I'm... not. You don't have my chili tofu? No. Then go out and get some. Go. Go. Oh. Okay. Yeah, I can-- Oh, my God. I'm joking. You have your mom's terrible sense of humor. Come here! Hi! It's good to see you, kiddo! Oh, my goodness, what are you doing here? But, really, I am starving. I hope it gets here soon. Do you like vegan food? Yeah. Yes, okay, good. Oh, thanks. I love all of the, um, art. So, you run a gallery? Eh, sorta. It's like an, um... artisan co-op. Bunch of local artists all share this space as a workshop, gallery, retail store. Whatever. It's all of ours. I just happen to own it. Do you live here alone? Yes. I never wanted to get married. That was your mom's thing. I wanted to travel, paint, own lots of cats. I don't have cats. None that are alive, anyway. So, Ever, why are you here? Right, yeah, I'm taking classes with the Youth Taiwan Study Tour. Mm-hm. Loveboat. Yeah. My parents thought it'd be a good idea for me to learn about some culture. Can't learn culture in a classroom. Culture is like the music at a Gezai opera. Getting lost in a back alley. Somebody biting into a moon cake. Two bodies touching on the dance floor. That, girlfriend... is culture. Don't get me wrong, I was delighted to get your call. But I didn't even know you were in Taipei. I came here because I need to ask you a favor. Ah! It's not much, but there's room to move, and the lighting is good during the day. Oh, she's beautiful. I had fun painting her. I didn't know you were a dancer. I got a callback. There's this dance company in New York. I may never get a chance like this again. I'm guessing your parents don't know about this callback either. My parents want me to become a doctor. Oh. Yeah. They would be heartbroken if I threw it all away just to dance. Yeah? What about your heart? Okay. Does the room work? Totally. Good. It'll be nice to see you around here. But in the meantime, get out, enjoy the city, and for God's sake, child, learn some culture. ♪ We're living in a blue sky ♪ ♪ We chase away The dark clouds ♪ ♪ Diamond castles In our eyes ♪ ♪ The beautiful shimmers out ♪ ♪ The lights gleam In technicolor ♪ ♪ Oh-oh, oh-oh ♪ ♪ We wrap around Our chrome hearts ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh ♪ ♪ The sun only makes it better ♪ ♪ Oh-oh, oh-oh ♪ ♪ We're not afraid Of who we are ♪ ♪ I'm climbing higher Higher, higher ♪ ♪ I'm getting lighter Lighter, lighter ♪ What-- What is it?

Just try it. Yeah. Thank you. Mm. Oh, yeah. That's good. You pick next one. That one? Look at that. This is amazing. You know, I have no idea what this is, but it's amazing. Right? So, why, why are you here? Why weren't you at the club? You know, I may or may not have followed you. I know. I get it, I get it. Like, you would have been fine, but I just had to make sure you were safe. Okay, so, that's why you followed me? Yeah. Okay, well, then I should be thanking you. I'm having a great time. Ready? Yeah. Is that a tomato? Mm-hm. So, that's a plum. I promise you it is not as bad as it smells. No, don't make me. Please. Just give it a little bite. Little bite. There you go. Yup. It's good. I like it. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, that's nice. I like this one. Wow. How much is that? It's like, it's like ten bucks. Come on, I got it. Hey, Rick. What are you doing here? Uh, we're just... grabbing a bite to eat. Nice. We're gonna meet up with the others. You want to come? Should be fun. Rain check? Uh, yeah, how about tomorrow at 6:00? Okay, what, like-- like a dinner? No, like a... like a date. Okay. Okay. I can't say I thought this trip would lead to a date with Boy Wonder. But he was definitely different than I expected. Hey. Did you sleep out here last night? Yeah. Stupid key card wouldn't work. That's because that's our room. Oh... That's funny. Mm. Ever, you have a secret admirer. What? No, it could just be someone being nice. People don't draw other people in beautiful, pensive poses unless they're madly in love with them. Okay, whoever did this is totally into you and would die for you. Hi. I bet it's Spencer. Wait, no, he can't draw for shit. Ooh. Maybe Benji. He goes to RISD. Oh, my God, it's totally Benji. He's kind of cute. I think he's allergic to everything. I think that's adorable. Dad, Japanese or English. You know I can't speak Mandarin. Why do you think you sent me here? Ever Wong! Ever-- Drag... I mean, Miss... How are you? Li Han told me he saw you running around the campus last night. Hi, headmistress. Oh, loving the cardigan today. He must be mistaken about my roomie here because we were together all last night, working on Ever's Mandarin. Go ahead, Ever. Show her. Uh... Oh, thank you. You know, I'm pretty sure my parents spent their life savings to send me here, so if I got expelled for sneaking out or lying... disappointment wouldn't even begin to describe it. No problem. I mean, what are friends for, right? Xavier's dad's here. He lives in Taipei. He must have gotten in trouble too. His family is super loaded. Okay, I heard that his mom is a Danish supermodel, and his dad is half-Japanese, half-Taiwanese, which is probably why he's here. How do you know all of this? Definitely not from the World Journal. Well, it sounds like somebody has a crush. Um. Obviously. We had such a moment last night. Could you tell? Like, there were definitely sparks. I would kill just to have the chance to have my heart broken by him. All right, maybe tonight we could-- Whoa! Tonight? No, no, no. It's so early in the summer. So? People don't date the first person they hook up with here. Now, we have to play the slow game. It's called Loveboat for a reason. Oh, hey. Hey, is everything all right down there? We saw-- Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was just my dad. Nothing new. What's going on with you two? Well, Ever was just wondering why it's called Loveboat. Oh, you haven't heard the story? Well, let me tell you the story of Loveboat. So, the program started for college students to learn about Taiwanese culture, right? Well, one year, I think back in the '70s, a big typhoon hit Taipei. Two students got trapped in the storm. And they were trying to get back to Huwei. The water was rising fast. But they managed to find a rowboat, and they climbed in. Taipei got completely flooded. It was actually really bad. But those two stayed safe in a little rowboat. And on that day, in that little rowboat, those two fell in love. So, Loveboat. Since then, it's been a little bit less about learning and more about love. I mean, even parents push their kids to come here, hoping that they find someone to marry. Oh, my God, that story is so freaking cute. Especially the way that you told it. Well, that's probably because I made it up. What? You got Chinese, you got Japanese, you got Spanish, you got Dutch periods of rule, so that when you take one of these dumplings and you put it in your mouth, you got all that history, and it's just... Am I mansplaining right now? I'm sorry. No, no, no. And these, um... These little wooden stick things, what are... What are these? I don't know. Beats me. I'm sorry, I just-- I love food. And I get excited when I talk about it. No, it's cute. And, I mean, yeah, you do know a lot about food. You should, like, run a restaurant or something. That is literally my dream. Really? Yeah. Okay, then why don't you do it? Cook? Yes! I'm sorry, do you want my mother to die out of pure disappointment? I mean, if it's what you want to do. Are your parents supportive or something? You know, actually, yeah. Yeah, tell me about that. Yeah. As long as I become, you know, some kind of surgeon and win a Nobel Prize or something, they'd be... supportive. Practical. Why not do both? Ooh. You ready? Okay. I will take this one. This is really good. I know. Know what the crazy thing is? You forgot the ginger. It gets better? I'm gonna make this one for you. Okay. You got to put it on the spoon. A little bit of ginger. That's a lot a bit of ginger. Just... just eat it. Just eat it. Here we are. This is one of my favorite spots. I can see why. Do you still have family in Taipei? Yup. My Aunt Claire. You know, my dad, he used to be a doctor here in Taipei. When they found out they were pregnant with me... he quit his job and they moved to the U.S. He couldn't afford to go through residency again, so now he works at the pharmacy in the hospital where I intern. Whenever I see him there, I remember how much he gave up for me. So, yeah, I get what you said earlier. It feels selfish to want to do what you want when your family has done all the hard work for you. Yeah. Yeah, my mom wanted me to study finance. My dad wanted me to play football. So as a family, we came together and compromised, and... now I'm just doing both. Can we just forget about real life and have fun this summer? Oh, my God! Ever! Look how-- I know. That's a nice smile. It's good, right? Look at the dimple. There's a dimple. No, I don't wanna see you. I wanna see him. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Full body. Oh. He works out. Hey! Ever, come help me with this. We're mopping? Mm-mm. We're painting. Your life is so cool. It has its moments. What is it, child? Out with it. I just... I don't know what I want. Right now in life, it feels like I'm torn between two of everything. Two cultures. Two languages. Two career paths. I feel like I should try to figure out my life for myself, you know, like you did. You traveled the world and focused on art, and look at where you are. This place is awesome. It's awesome, yes. But look at your mother. She went to university. She met a nice doctor. She had a nice family. And she moved to the one place where you can build something from nothing. Ohio. She didn't follow her dreams. You know, maybe you were her dream. She looks so happy. Do you know why I named this place meng die? It means "butterfly dream." See, there was this old philosopher, and one night, he dreamt that he was a butterfly. And when he woke up, he was just a man again. But because that dream, it felt so real, he wondered if he was a man who was dreaming of being a butterfly, or if he was, in fact, a butterfly who was now dreaming of being a man. Do you understand why I'm telling you this, Ever? Sometimes we're torn between two dreams. No. Meng die reminds me never to take life too seriously. Here's the thing, Ever. You worry so much about the life that you want, you never take the time to appreciate the life that you have. Your turn. What? Me? No! I don't know how to do this. Yeah, you're not supposed to. Catch. Oh, sorry! Go on, take it. Okay. Don't think. Have fun. Oh! Auntie Shu was right. Okay, see? There you go. I just needed to try and enjoy the moment. So for the first time in my life, that's exactly what I did. You're literally glowing, and I'm covered in spilled matcha. I hate you, but I love you. Ever, do you have cello now? How's the Mandarin now? It's getting a lot better. How many Chinese words can you write, huh? A-- A lot. How's school over there? Yeah, got to go. Love you. Bye-bye! Bye. Rise and shine. Mm. Want some caffeine? Mm-hm. Yeah? Lots of cream, lots of sugar. Oh, I'm exhausted. Yeah, that'll happen when you go out every night of the week. How did you even get in here? Your door was open. Not unlocked. Just open. Mm. Yeah, lucky no creeps got in here. I wouldn't be so sure. All right, let's get up. Come on, let's go for a hike! Earthquake! No! No. No! Come on! Oh, my God, the mosquitoes here. Oh, my God, wait, wait, wait, don't step on it. I'm okay for now. Feels like you're dying. You know, I'm not gonna make it. Just go on without me. Please. Just, please. You okay? Yeah. Soph, I promise, the view from the top is so much better. But I'm already enjoying this view. No, seriously, I'll catch up in two seconds. You two cuties go. Go on without me. - You sure? - Yeah. Yeah. Please. Phew. So, how's it going with you two? What, Sophie? We're cool. She's cool. I like her. Yeah. What about you and Wonder Boy? Rick? We're good. So, how's dance going? Have you sent in your audition? Uh, I think I'm gonna record it tomorrow. Yeah, I kind of put it off till the last minute 'cause, you know. I don't know. Tell me. I've worked really hard to be good enough, but... what if I'm not? Well, what if you are? Hey! Hey. Is everything okay? Sorry, I'm just, kind of in my head, I guess. What's wrong? My Aunt Claire is having a party tomorrow night, and she is strongly encouraging that Sophie and I show up, put on our clean faces, and make her look good in front of her high-society friends. I take it you don't want to go. My family is just still really bitter that I broke up with Jenna. And, if you can imagine, they like her better than they like me. Can... can I ask you something? Why did you end things? We just had absolutely nothing in common. Yeah. Yeah, no, I-- I get that. It's important. Hey... Come with me to the party. You're asking me to go to a party where your family's gonna be there wishing I was your ex-girlfriend the whole time. Did I mention that there would be free food and drinks? And... I'll be there. You know. Okay. I'll think about it. Come on. Really? Wait, slow down! Wow. Hey, guys! I finally made it. Ever. I have a surprise for you. I figure since you're going to a fancy event with this boy who you say is just a friend who's a boy who's not your boyfriend... you might like this. Oh, my God. Really? Yeah. Thank you, Auntie Shu. It's beautiful. You're welcome. Hey, everyone's taking off. Can you lock up when you leave? Yeah, no problem. Oh, the typhoon's not supposed to hit the city, but be sure to shut the windows. Okay. Of course. Good luck with the dance! And remember, meng die. After everything I had experienced this summer, I was finally ready for my audition. But what I wasn't expecting was how truly good it felt to just be... me. Oh, shit. I'll see you later. Okay. Okay, see you. Oh, my God. You look absolutely... perfect. Wow. I'm sorry I'm so late. Oh, that's okay. Let's grab you something to drink. Cheers. I can't believe how amazing this party is. That is my Aunt Claire for you. She throws this party every year. and no storm's gonna stop her. How about I introduce you? Okay. Aunt Claire. Uncle David. Hi. Hello. Good to see you. Uh, this is Ever, my date. Hello, dear. Are you enjoying the party? Oh, absolutely. It's really lovely. So, how did you meet Frederick? Oh, Rick? I feel like I've known him my whole life, thanks to the World Journal. Oh, so you're a fan of his? Oh, God, no. You know, to be honest with you, I've always really sort of hated him. We met at Huwei. Ever is learning calligraphy. Trying to. Oh, my goodness. Jenna! You came! Jenna? Jenna, like your ex? Welcome. What is she doing here? She was in Taipei, and so we decided to invite her to the party. I can see that. Rick. Hi. Hey. Come here. It's, um... It's really good to see you. You too. You look great. Thank you. You too. This is Ever. - Jenna. Hi. - Hi. I love your dress. Thank you. We were so sorry to hear about you two splitting up. Jenna... Ever is graduating soon too, and she's going to be studying medicine at Case Western Reserve. And her father is a very successful doctor in the States. Internal medicine, right? Was a doctor. Yeah, when we moved to America, he had to give up his practice, and he works in a pharmacy now. But, I'm currently in the process of auditioning for a dance company. Dance? How lovely. We must mingle. Jenna... Oh, Frederick, let's chat later. Okay. Nice to meet you... Ever. Yes. Hey! You have met my husband. Ever. What was that? I didn't know she was gonna be here. No, I'm not talking about her. I mean like my dad and med school. I'm sorry, okay? It's just, I'm really, really nervous. I mean, you could see it. My family is complicated. And I just... I just needed, like, some kind of buffer. Is that why I'm here? I'm just-- I'm a buffer? No, no, no. It's just... I just don't want to give them anything else to criticize me about. Like my dad working in a pharmacy? Oh, my God, such a shit show. Mm. Bringing Xavier? Huge mistake. He just told Uncle Michael he wants to travel around and live in a van for a year. Why would he say something like that? Because it's the truth. I swear, it's like he gets off on making a fool of himself. We're done. I'm so over it. Wait, where are you going? Suddenly I'm not in the party mood. Here. You can finish that. Ever. What are you doing here? I saw you leave the party early. They're kind of intense, huh? Yeah. Rick was making me out to be someone that I'm not. Yeah, I hear you. Sophie was parading me around, gushing about my father's business. Talking about how close him and I are, which is complete bullshit. My father avoids me because I don't follow his rules and be whoever he wants me to be. I guess we both got used tonight. I just... I feel so stupid in this dress right now. Well... For what it's worth, I think you look great. And... if you want to talk about stupid... what about me trying out your dance moves? It's not bad. Actually, it's more of a like... ♪ You've seen my red as blue ♪ ♪ I don't belong In your universe ♪ Okay. Okay. I'm coming. There it is. Yeah. Whoa.

We're both full of surprises. Wait. Those sketches. They're from you? Sorry. Ever, are you okay? Yeah. The typhoon hit the city hard. There is no power, so we are gathering here. Okay. I was so worried when we got back and you weren't here. I made it back. I'm fine. Can we... Yeah? Listen, I... I am so sorry... about how I treated you in front of my family. How I acted... has nothing to do with you. Okay? I care about you so much. What's going on? It's the typhoon. It's bad. The city's flooding. Parents are worried, and... they want us to leave as soon as the storm passes. They want me and Sophie out of Taipei. You're leaving? I-- I'm sorry. I wish things could be different. I wish tonight was different. Me too. Because when I'm with you, I am... more me than I've ever been. Oh, my God. No. Auntie Shu? Auntie Shu? Ever! Oh! I'm so glad you're okay. We tried calling you all night. Your parents were worried sick. Auntie Shu, your-- your gallery. Everything is ruined. I know. I know. I'm so sorry. I left the windows open. I was just-- I was in such a hurry to get out, and I just-- I forgot. It's gonna be okay. It'll be all right. Hey. You need to talk to your mother. Come on. She's worried. - Hello? - Hello? Baba! It's Ever! Ever! Ever. Is she okay? Your father and I were watching the news. Are you safe? I'm fine. But Auntie Shu... Do you have any idea how many people we have called? And you never told us you've been visiting Auntie Shu. Sorry, I-- I... And now you're dancing? She told you? She didn't tell us anything. We got a call from some man, and he was talking about a... Dancing audition. A, uh, A dance audition. He couldn't reach you. What did he say? What aren't you telling us? Stop, Mom, just-- just tell me what he said. He said you should try again next year. That's it? What is this all about? It's nothing. I, um... Don't be worried about me, okay? I'm okay. Okay. Bye. A typhoon had come, and all it brought was chaos in every way. Here, let me help. Thanks. How you holding up? You know, I'm doing all right. The storm really did a number on this place. I hope they don't still expect us to put on that festival. I heard it was canceled. Yeah. Hey, um, I'm sorry about the other night. Yeah, me too. I just really like hanging out with you. Same. I really screwed things up. With my parents. My aunt's gallery. I even got rejected from that dance company. That sucks, Ever. I'm sorry. Actually... I'm kind of relieved. I think I was trying so hard to make it work in dance because I thought, you know, if I could just do that, I'd convince my parents that I can be whatever I want, instead of what they expect me to be. I get that. You do? Oh, yeah. I stopped trying to become someone else a long time ago. I really messed things up. Well, being a guy who screws up a lot... it's never too late to make things right. Auntie Shu. This place looks like it could use some help. I have an idea. There you go. Let me help. Let me help. You okay? You got it? All right.

And as we finished preparing our own Loveboat festival... I started to feel that way about my life too. And the irony was my realization that not everything needed to be clear. The key was having the courage to leap into the unknown. I can't believe you pulled it off. Don't jinx it. I haven't pulled it off yet. Either way, you made the festival happen. Come on. I have a surprise for you. Mom! Dad! Ever. It's wonderful to see you, Ever. What, what are you doing here? We heard what you're up to, and your Auntie Shu says we should come see for ourselves. What I've been up to? Um, can we talk for a minute? Yeah. Sure. I'm really glad that the both of you are here. There's something that I've been meaning to tell you. I haven't been completely honest with you. I don't want to go to med school. You don't? But you're applying for all the programs. I only did that because I thought that's what you wanted. I auditioned to the dance company without telling you because I was afraid that you would disapprove. But, I mean, being here with these people... it's made me realize that... I'm still figuring out what I want. ♪ Is it painted on my face? ♪ ♪ 'Cause you won't look away ♪ ♪ I've put up a barricade ♪ ♪ All my life ♪ ♪ Life ♪ ♪ I hide ♪ ♪ I feel vulnerable ♪ As we made our way onto the stage, I didn't care about a dance company or med school. I cared about helping Auntie Shu, and the artists whose work was damaged by the storm. We'd like to welcome you to the first official Loveboat festival. And the person who put this all together, Ever Wong. ♪ I'm not scared at all ♪ This performance is a love letter to a place that I never knew before eight weeks ago. Now... it's part of me. It's called... I cared about everyone from Loveboat getting to celebrate the culture and the history we spent the entire summer immersing ourselves in. I cared about my parents getting to see me feeling more alive than I ever had in my life. ♪ Every day ♪ ♪ And night ♪ ♪ When I close my eyes ♪ ♪ I'm not scared at all ♪ It was then that everything in the universe finally came together.

Sophie! I can't believe you came! Obviously. I wouldn't miss it. Oh, and this is Jeremy. We met at a typhoon beach clean-up. He's in a band. My family's furious, but whatever. They even had four songs written about them. Uh, five, actually. The new one just sort of came to me. Hello, it's nice to meet you, Jeremy. Yeah. Um... Cool dance thingy. I second that. It was a very cool dance... thingy. We'll catch you later. Okay. Come on, Jer. I want to hear the new song. They're cute. I give it a week. No. Full album, at least. Ever, what you're doing here is really amazing. Congrats. You should be proud. Thank you. And thank you for showing up. It really does mean a lot. What, are you kidding me? I had to see Girl Wonder in action. Well, you know, I look forward to seeing Boy Wonder in this year's edition of the World Journal. Actually, I was hoping not to be Boy Wonder in the World Journal this year. Don't be a stranger. Oh, no, don't worry. I won't. My mom made me keep your contact for "networking purposes." So... Ah. Okay, don't act like you didn't already add me to your favorites. Shut up! One dance number wasn't enough? Hi. I just can't believe you'd do that. What? Dance without me. So... what now, Forever-Ever? I... haven't really thought much beyond that point. Well, I think it's off to a great start. Really? Yeah? Mm-hm. You know, it's... It's actually kind of nice not having it all figured out.
