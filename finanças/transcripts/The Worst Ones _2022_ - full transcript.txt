So... what do I have to do? There's nothing complicated, you'll see. We'll ask you a few questions, just getting to know you, yeah? And... just feel at ease to speak the way you usually do. Like with your buddies. After that we'll do a bit of improvisation. Is that okay with you? Hey, guys, get outta here! Are you two years old or what? Sorry, I'll shut the other door. Sorry. - We were just... - Okay? We're really behind, so can we stay during the lunch break? - I understand if it's too awkward. - Yes, of course, no problem. - Take your time. - Thanks. Thank you! - Did you hurt yourself? - A bit, but it's okay. So, you've just got out? - You must be happy. - Yeah, of course. You did three months, is that right? What happened? Driving without a license, hit-and-run with aggravating circumstances... But you cheered things up for me. - Really? You're pleased? - Yeah. I didn't know who you were that first time in the yard. Then they told me you were going to make a movie or something, and that you'd noticed me. I didn't believe it at first. Wait, sorry. This is great, but let's do it in order, so we leave nothing out, yeah? - Can you tell us your name? - Jessy. - Your age? - Seventeen. This brother and sister live with their gran. And the sister gets pregnant, but she's only 15. Her little brother really struggles with this. He's afraid of being abandoned again, you see? Does that sound tricky for you? No. Are you just auditioning the local kids? Yes, mostly children from the Picasso neighborhood. But not only, because... Bless you! Because... that's where we'll be filming this summer. You've been well informed! No. I just know about Sofiane, Liana and Ryan. Yes. Sounds like you're only taking the worst ones. What do you mean, "the worst ones"? Yes, I'm looking for children who haven't had very easy lives. Because in the movie the story isn't very easy. So, you have to imagine yourself in it. Do you have brothers and sisters? Yes, five. And what do your parents do? My dad works at Sofranor and my mom doesn't work. - What's Sofranor? - A shrimp factory. Tell me, Maylis, how do you feel about being here, now, having this audition? Is it scary? No, I don't care. It's just being in front of a camera. Sometimes I don't like being looked at. Why? I feel like they're laughing at me. Lily, do you have a boyfriend? No, I just broke up. The guy we saw you kissing in the club where we found you? No! He was so fugly! I had this boyfriend, Eddy. But I couldn't have any pals, any guy pals, I couldn't talk to my besties, I couldn't go out... One day he took my phone and wiped all my contacts. Snap, Facebook, Messenger, TikTok, Insta... I couldn't believe it, I was like: "What the hell?" He didn't get that what he was doing was wrong. So I ended it. I'm not a dog you lock up in a cage. It was tricky getting hold of you. You gave us the runaround. Didn't you want to come to the audition? I don't like making movies. - Really? - Have you already done it, then? Once, at school, someone asked me to go for an audition in Boulogne-sur-Mer, for a movie, and I said: "No, I don't like it." So why have you come this time, buddy? My sister wanted me to. And you live with your sister, right? Yeah. Since this year. And your mom? I see her sometimes. You can get up if you want, Ryan. You don't have to talk sitting down. Okay. Would you like to tell me the sort of things you like doing? Playing on my games console. GTA5. What does that involve? You do missions, capture people, and kill them. You seemed really angry when we saw you in the schoolyard. What happened? He was looking for a fight. Who? Esteban Holaind. He said: "Your mom's a whore." That made you angry? Is that the worst insult? Yes, you don't say stuff about people's moms. I don't do nothing, they rile me up, then they say I've been fighting. They shouldn't try it on with me. I used to get in lots of fights at school too. Apart from that, is school okay? No. I don't like it. - What don't you like? - Class. And studying. Who was the man sitting next to you on the bench in the school corridor? My LSA. What's an LSA? - A learning... - A learning support assistant. And what does he do? He helps me study and concentrate. Do you listen to music? Do you like music? - There must be something. - Yes. - Rémy. - No, really? Yeah. In my foster family I didn't like him, but now I do. I listened to him a lot, and now I like him. I like Rémy too. Tell me, Ryan. Do you ever feel sad? No? You've never in your life felt sad? You've never cried? No. - You must have when you were little. - Yes, when I was little, of course. But I've never cried since. And why do you think you never cry? Because I never hurt. THE WORST ONES My baby, my love... Okay, that's good, don't cut. Nobody move. We'll just do that again, that contact. Ryan, can you relax your face a bit? It's as if you're wary, as if Lily scares you. On the contrary, she's comforting you, buddy. And Lily, don't overdo it with his face. Be gentler, just brush it. It's okay. We've got lots and lots of options, Ryan. Don't worry about it. Go to Maylis. Cut. Okay, we've cut. Change the setting. Romain? Up to the bedroom. In, what, twenty minutes? Yeah, twenty minutes. Twenty minutes to set up. Let's go! Cat got your tongue? Want me to clear all the kids away from the entrance? No, thanks. - Are you sure? - Thanks. Okay. - An excellent actor! - My baby! Thank you so much for the house. It's the perfect setting. Thanks. Well, I'd better get back. Kiss-kiss! Why are you here, Jessy? You're not filming today. "Hello, how are you?" "Very well, thank you!" Ryan, we need you now. What is your job, really? Mister, take him, he's a great actor! He can puke on command, he's crazy! He won't disappoint you, please take him! Go on, puke! Gimme five... ha, got you! Take him! Mr. Belgian! Please! - Take him! - See you. At least give him a chance! He's run off. Bye, Mr. Belgian! You know... in the six days of filming you've made great progress. I'm impressed. Magnificent! Ryan, just ride your bike past this wall. Action! Slowly. Cut! Wait, wait! Ryan! Lily, can you come after your smoke, so I can take your mic off? Was it less scratchy this time? Yeah. The tape I used was no good. Victor, where's the DT48? Next to the magic arm. Lily, can you come here, please? Coming! There. Coming! Shit! Can you take your tummy off? Yeah. All right, honey? Yeah. In a minute. - It's not too tight? - No. - That feels good, eh? - Yeah. My stuff is? There it is. Thanks. Want one? Did you enjoy it today? I'm enjoying it anyway. That looks great! Put your hands down. Don't you like this cream? Is this your bedroom? Yeah. - It's cool. - Bye, everyone! See you tomorrow. See you. Okay? Yo. Okay, nipper? Lily? Yeah. - Okay? - Fine. I just got in. Did you go to the city hall for my papers? Yeah, they're on the chest by the front door. Yes, my boy! Are you cold? Thanks, sweetie. Where have you been? Filming. You were there today? Yeah. Was it good? Really good. "Fuck your mom, the fat cow!" No. "Don't you get it? Fuck you!" Shit! Really bad language. I hope you don't talk like that at school. "Your sister's a slut. She doesn't even know who the brat's dad is." Really! And you... Come on, concentrate! "I'm gonna fuck you up!" Hang on. Just before that, you forgot... "On my mom's life..." "On my mom's life, I swear I'll take you apart!" No, it's not that. "Get outta here, loser!" "And with your old..." Yes. - No. - Yes. I can say it how I like. - Then why did he write it like this? - In my own words, he said. In my own words. Make an effort, please. "Doesn't your mom get it?" Shit, it's a fucking pain! Don't talk like that, Ryan. It's a pain for me too, helping you. Come on, you do it really well. Come on, sweetie. You're really believable, anyway. Stop it. Stop banging. You know what, Ryan? Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Ryan, look at me. Let's play that game. Where you say panier, piano, as quickly as possible. You do it. Come on, quickly! Faster, faster, faster! Handsome boy! Me handsome! Gimme five! Get outta here, stinky! 2 years 2 months 5 days u been gone my brother. Time passes so quickly... and as every day I cant stop thinking about you and how u fought for 10 long months against that fucking disease. SCHEDULE FOR JULY 19 2021 Sound Consume more, you'll live less PICKPOCKET PRESIDENT. WATCH YOUR PENSION. You have 3 new messages! Cooey, okay? Cam? - All right? - Yeah, and you? You from Coquelle? - Yeah, and you? - Boulogne-sur-Mer. What are you doing? Nothing. I'm going to bed soon. Can I come with you? Come on. You're up for it! Wanna show me some of your body? - And you? - You can touch yourself. Go ahead. - Wesh Lily 62? - Yeah, that's me. You look young. You're beautiful. Okay, Mom? Hello, sweetheart. All right, Ryan? Okay, Mélodie? Good. And the kids? Good. Hello, Mrs. Ducroy. Shall we? Yes, hello. The last catch-up was six months ago, which was more or less, Ryan, when you went to live with your sister. Mélodie, can you tell us how it's going? Well... better and better, I think. His school grades are still bad. But with the LSA that'll change, I think. I hope it's the same one next term. As for his behavior at home, I think he's a bit calmer. I think he's happy with us, it gives him boundaries. Stop it! Be careful, Mélodie. Be careful what you say. She didn't give birth to him. You can see that. I think me and Ryan need to get back together. Okay, life hasn't been a bed of roses, I have my weaknesses... but you can't accuse me of any serious wrongdoing. There wasn't any abuse. Nothing serious. Also, I gave my authorization for him to make that movie. Now we can move forward. Right, Ryan? Right, my love? Our job, Mrs. Ducroy, is first to evaluate his needs. We must take our time, but the aim is for you to reassume your role as his mom. The aim? The aim is for him to come home. He has to understand that he only has one mom. Okay? And that she's not perfect. We have to stress that it's an evolving process. There is more communication now. And, Ma'am, we do understand that you want... to see more of him. But what we can see is that the situation is still too fragile. I don't think that Ryan is ready yet, that he's in the right state, to move fully back in with his mom. There have been too many missteps, it's too sudden. And, Ryan, you have to be careful about your outbursts. You can be angry, but don't you think you should learn to control it? Well, Ryan? Ryan, do you want to go back to live with your mom? Yes. Yes, I'd like to. There! What sort of music do you like? Well... Do you want to put something you like on? Here. Shit! Sorry. Sorry, I've only just passed my test. I'm still learning. Shit, that freaked me out! Driving's a nightmare. Do you want to learn? I dunno. Maybe. Lily! I've got my head up my ass! I couldn't wake up. My alarm didn't go off. You got a smoke? Thanks. Cut! Cut! You have to make an effort. Come on, concentrate! This is a very important scene. Your sister's pregnant, she's not taking care of you, and everyone in the school is insulting her, calling her a slut. You're not just angry, you're raging! Do you understand? That's what I want to see, real rage. You can do it. Come on. We can't waste 15 minutes getting ready again for every take! Maylis! Be ready when I give you the sign. To say your line. Judith, help her, there! Everyone ready, please! Action! You're smiling! Eye to eye! Don't tell me to fuck off, I'll kill you! Ryan, come here. Forget the lines, they're no good. Insult each other with your own words. - Okay. - Yeah, okay? - Say to him: "Your mom's a whore." - Okay. Tell him that: "Your mom's a whore." Say: "Your mom's a whore." Your sister's knocked up. - You son of a bitch. - Beat it! - Your mom's a whore! - Huh, hobo? Fuck you! Shit... Son of a bitch! Diss my mom again and I'll show you. - Fucker! - Bastard! - I'm gonna fuck you up! - Fucking fag! - What you doing? - Leave him! Leave him to me! Go for it! - Son of a bitch! - Go! You're dead! Go for it! What you trying to do? Do him, fuck him up! Go on, fight! Wait, wait! Okay, that's enough! Mathieu, the boom. Stop it now! Gently, gently. Calm down. It's okay, calm down. Calm down. Let's put him down. Get back. It's okay, buddy. Shit, the state I'm in! Okay, little bro'? Fuck! Shit! Ryan, you were smiling! Stop smiling! When you're being attacked, don't smile, okay? It's not a joke! We need you. No one cares about this movie. Can I take your mic off? Wait, I'll take this off. You were tough, buddy. Lily? Remember that if your mic's still on, I hear everything. Especially when you fart coming out of the canteen. I'm kidding. You scared me! Anyway, I don't fart. Judith, what's this mess? Sort out these extras. Boom operator is a dangerous job. Sorry, I'm coming! See you later. See you later. Rémy here Telling you the truth My rhymes are for thinking about After school we'd get our ball... Can I? Yeah, go ahead. After school you'd be on your balcony Watching your pals, though your mom said no After school we'd have throwing battles And if we broke a window we'd run away laughing Remember back then, on the street Not given any shit if you played ball I preferred the street to a palace Because you learned adult stuff before you grew up Now here, in the north If the cops come by, protect your head... Sit up, pussycat. You respect those who respected you as a kid I'm 20, I'll teach you about life With balls and some craziness, you can take flight I remember I had nothing Seeing the cops rounding us up This is Réminem telling you about your struggles Cos we share this same bitch of a life Yo, homies! Why are you here? Me and Lily are doing the sex scene. My little hottie! I hope you've shaved, I don't wanna beat through the bush! You're a killer! Sit down, sit down! And calm down! Lily, I'm not hungry. Want my banana? Judith, hang on. - What's the movie's name? - Pissing into the North Wind. On my mother's life, what a lame title! That sucks! It's a proverb from northern France. Pissing into the north wind or arguing with your boss, you lose. Yeah, my gran always used to say that. There, see! She believed me, the loser! - What a loser! - Loser! Shut your trap! Don't confuse Lily with the sluts you usually screw. Shut your dyke mouth! I don't remember asking for your opinion. Well, I'm telling you anyway. Micro dick! One day I had a party at home, she came, and she left her sweater. I thought: "Well!" And I smelled it. It had a crazy effect on me. Every day after, I needed to smell it. I couldn't understand it, I thought: "You've got a problem, pal!" I didn't realize, you see? I didn't realize that I was falling in love. I just kept on smelling her sweater for weeks, like a jerk. There. - Didn't you see her again? - Yes, I did. I wasn't wrong about that smell. That's why I'm telling you. After that, she was my whole life for three years. I gave her back her sweater, we made love, and it was... miraculous. It was like there'd been a void inside me, and all of a sudden it was inhabited. It was filled with her. Why did it end? Because I wanted her to save me, I think. That's not how it works. - How old were you when you met her? - 22. Your first screw at 22? Yeah, all right! No, I'm not a fast mover. First time at 22, first movie at 54. Anyway, I'm telling you my life story, but... it's so you'll understand what we must try to find together. What happens when you first fall in love. The thrill, the emotion, the heart beating wildly... The heart... - The heart beating wildly? What's that? - Jessy. - Have you ever been in love? - Me? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It was a long time ago. She made me suffer. It was the first time I got laid. That I made love. Do you want to tell us a bit more, or not? It was two years ago. Her name was Shirine, the cousin of a local girl. Everyone wanted some of that. So when I got her, everyone was mad. They were all jealous. So that put pressure on her, and she dumped me. And you? Never done it. What are you laughing at? I've never done it, I said. I haven't, end of! They all think I'm a slut because I made out with boys in 8th grade. That's all they remember. Once you're a slut here, you're always a slut. It's just that I was in a bad way last year, and I did stupid things. Look into each other's eyes while saying nothing. Remain concentrated until I end the exercise. Can you do that? That's all. Try to dive into the other's eyes, and to merge your face into theirs. Mentally. That's it. That's it. Get into your movie character, and I'll ask you questions. - Okay. - That's all. All right? All right. How long have the two of you been together? Three months, approximately. Where did you meet? At the ice rink. Who made the first move? - She came onto me first. - What? It was you! She said: "You on Snapchat?" Then she asked for my number. And then... Then I called him. Can you tell me a bit about the first time you made love? Was it... How was it? It wasn't bad. What do you mean, "not bad"? No, it was good, it was done well. Do you live together? Soon, I hope. The thing is, I'm doing time, and... she's pregnant. Congratulations! For the baby, not prison. - Thanks. - Thank you, thank you. Do you daydream about getting out of prison? What'll happen? Well... I'll take him in my arms, I'll hug him really tight, and tell him that I missed him. And that it was really tough without him. That I thought about him all the time. And that I love him. And you, Jessy. What do you like most about her? Are you serious? You don't know? Stop taking so long! Yes! I know, I know. It's when she does that, she has that thingy there. She has that thingy there when she smiles. That makes me melt. - The dimple? - Yeah. Hello. Hi, Maylis. Are you okay? Yeah. I'm sorry, but Maylis doesn't want to carry on. Meaning? She doesn't want to carry on with the movie. I'm sorry, but she wants to stop. You want to stop filming? Yeah. But, you know... there are two weeks to go, with scenes in which you appear. You remember that? There are two scenes with other family members, and I don't have any lines. But we don't care that you don't have any lines, Maylis. That's got nothing to do with it. You're part of the scene. Your presence is important, you're Ryan and Lily's sister. And you're there with them. You're really important to the story. It's not up to you to decide. Do you understand? Now I... - I'll have to change the story. - That's not true. I'm really disappointed too. But I can't force her. I have to respect her decision. I don't understand, Maylis. Everything was going so well. Why? Why are you doing this? I don't like it. Thank you. Bye. Lily! Come and talk, I'm not gonna eat you. They pay for everything? That's dope, cushy! You're being brainwashed, sis', don't listen to gossip. - You get presents, right? - Presents? You seen any? - And money? - Money? Yeah, money. I'm working for it. - What are you being paid for? - Acting in the movie. This movie that's all about lowlifes? And you're happy doing that? You're a real piece of work! Why do you say that? Can't you see it's shit? You take all the parking spaces, pissing everyone off. My old lady couldn't find a space. Where's the respect? There isn't any! Do you agree? Is it right? LOL! They think they own the place. Yeah, whatever, I don't give a shit! Little brother! Come here a sec. - What? - Are you afraid? Don't worry, I just want to check something. The resemblance! He looks just like your brother, brought back to life! Give me your phone. A family photo. You fat bitch, stop messing with me! Don't take it badly. Stop it! It's for when you're a star, I can sell your photo. - I'll fuck you up, you fat slut! - Are you serious? You've busted my phone, you fucking scumbag! Go get yourself a life, you bitch! Shut up! Hobo, bumming money off everyone! You're pathetic! Your brother died and all you do is suck cocks! Don't you mention my little brother! Can anyone beside your mom come for you? You'll have to wait, then. I can't. Why? - I'm filming. - Then you shouldn't have hurt that girl. Bitch. Sorry? What? Here, I bought you some smokes. You're the best! Can I? Yeah, go ahead. Does it bother you? Excuse me. - Okay, guys? - Yeah. Yeah? Look, we'll start with just a kiss. Just that. It'll be a close-up of your faces. We'll start nice and calm, so that you can gradually ease into it, yeah? Take off your robes, please. - Totally off? - Yeah. Lily. You can keep your bra on, but drop the straps down, please. There, thanks. Above all, if anything at all feels wrong, you must absolutely speak up. Okay? The crew don't need to be here, so we're clearing the set. That'll be better. Manu, shall we go? Get into position. Lie on your sides. There. A bit closer. Yes, yes, closer, Lily. Closer than that. You can... yeah. Tangle your legs together, it'll help you get closer. Dive into each other's eyes. Concentrate. Action! - What do we do? - Kiss. Okay. Lily, maybe it's you who takes the initiative to kiss. Cut! Okay. We'll carry on like that, but... it's a bit too shy, a bit distant, at the moment. Lily, can you come here a second, please? Cut! I don't know. Let yourselves go a bit. Jessy, it's like you've never touched a girl before. In real life, the two of you are really full of life, very carnal. And you can do much better, I know you can. You've had much harder things to do, from the very start. Come on! What I'd like from you, Lily, is to hear your breathing. I'm not asking you to squeal. It's just... intimate. It's small, it's the dawning of pleasure. You see? It's... You see? No more than that. You see? Sexy. No more than that. Let's do it again. Okay? Do you want some water? Get outta here, bro'! This fucking fag keeps looking at my ass! Move! Move! That's out of line. You're the one out of line! You think I'm a fag too? Move! I'm outta here. Asshole! We'll discuss that later. You don't disrespect anyone on this movie set. We'll clear the set a bit more. There are too many people here. Just one person on sound, and one on the camera, please. Victor, go. Give Camille the boom. Please, out you go. From the top. Clapperboard. Get into position. Try not to make any noise, just the breathing. There. Great. Jessy. Jessy, wait! Is he for real? Coming for a drink at the hotel? - With you all? - Yeah. You bet! - Totally! - I'll tell you when we're going. You can stop working now. I haven't finished yet. Gabriel invited me to come for a drink. That's really nice. At the hotel. - Great. - Yeah. The worst thing is, this fag is a great actor! Hi. Hi, beautiful. Well done, you were really great. What do you want? A ruby Leffe. A ruby Leffe and a glass of red, please. Do you have vanilla ice cream and whipped cream? Yeah. Great. Let's go over there, where it's a bit quieter. Yeah, okay, if you like. When a shoot ends, it can be really tough after. You miss the people. We're not there yet, but... Don't worry, I've been through worse. No, but I'm telling you, it's a funny feeling. But it's quite normal, okay? Just be aware of that. It won't just be you who's miserable. It might be over, but you still exist... I really love it, you know? - Yeah? - Yeah. Acting and all that. - Really? - I love it! - Really? - Yeah. I'm sorry that I'm a bit harsh at times. It drives me mad when you don't give 100%. You really have a talent. I don't know if you realize, but not everyone can act like that. That was awkward with Jessy. - Earlier? - Yeah. I don't know if Clovis looked at his butt, but I doubt it. At the same time, he looks so gay. He has that way about him. He is, yes, but... I knew it, I'd rumbled him! That doesn't mean he ogles every man, and especially not a 17-year-old. It's up to them what they do. It's not my first. I had this pal in 8th grade whose mom was a dyke. She was really nice. I don't see her anymore. You know, actually... I want to tell you something... and you'll get the money to make your movie with. I got it for 600,000, including all the renovation. And the editing... Try the suburbs. Shall I take you home, Lily? Here. What was that about you breaking someone's nose? What, that stupid fucking bitch? I see the prosecutor in three weeks, he'll lecture me, end of! That's what happened last time. Do you get in a lot of fights? Yeah. Last year, after Kenzo died, I was out of control. I just didn't know what to do. But I don't even regret all the things I did. I just wanted to die. It was that or killing myself. You really thought about killing yourself? It was just that I didn't understand, why him and not me, you see? And I still don't understand it. And it... it fries my brain cells, you see? What sort of things did you do? I can't get a picture. I was hanging out with these guys, and, I dunno, I felt I was in love with two of them. Well, with one, mostly. I blew them in the school bathroom. I did it two or three times. And the rumor got out. People found out, and that stuck. - Did you want to or did you feel forced? - Yeah! Yeah, I wanted to. I wanted to do it. I'm asking because... when I was eleven, I was sexually assaulted by a friend's older brother, who was sixteen. I didn't realize at the time that that wasn't right. It was abuse. Really? You didn't realize? No, sometimes it's not obvious. You don't say no, you think it's a game, but deep down you know you're being forced. That's why I asked, because... you should really speak out... All these fucking mosquitoes! Do you think he really heard me from my mic? Who? Victor? - Yeah. - No, it was a joke. Why? Did you say stuff he shouldn't hear? No. No, I dunno. What's wrong? You're acting weird. No, but... you'll make fun of me. About what? - What? - I really have the hots for Victor. No! Remember when we were outside, talking? He joined us, and I couldn't listen to you anymore. I thought you must have realized. What? That's crazy! No, I didn't realize, I swear. I asked him if he'd get my phone for me. And he said: "I'd go to the ends of the earth for you!" I think maybe he does like me. Have you given some thought about what you want to do next year? Yeah, maybe acting. I love it. It's not easy, you know? Just because you've been in one movie... You're talented, for sure, but it's a real jungle. No worries, I'm a star! Where there's a will there's a way. I'll go to Paris and annihilate them! And I'll come see you. Totally! I don't have a big place, but I'll make you a nice cozy bed. - You'll like my neighborhood. - I can't wait. I gotta take a piss. I'm starving! I need to eat. Yeah, I'm really hungry too. I've got some little buns and Nutella. Oh, yeah, you're fantastic! Fucking awesome! Take care Fight, Kenzo! Sorry. - See you tomorrow, sweetie. - See you tomorrow. Kiss-kiss! In memory of our little angel Kenzo horribly taken from us by cancer Well, he had a good night, apart from headaches between 4 and 5 a.m. His saturation is good, they'll keep an eye on that. And thanks to Wenzou for this present. It really relaxes Kenzo. And it's really beautiful. The brand is Kidom. You can order them online. I've put the link under the video. Kiss-kiss! Thank you, thank you, thank you! You can't imagine how much he wanted that. So thanks to Laurie and David of the Picasso neighborhood group. Thanks also for all your care, all your notes, all your presents, all your messages. We keep going thanks to you! That fucking fag was there, staring at my ass! Then whatsizname, Gabriel, started dissing me. I should have fucked him up. For sure, I swear. Did the girl do okay? Lily? Yeah, she was in her element. Cock! I feel sorry for her. Everyone disses her, but she's a good kid. She's got no self-respect. I saw her this time, she was with Karim. Heels this high, a skirt up to her pussy, and a top like in strips, you know? Whether we're in jeans or a dress, we get called whores. Even in warm-ups you'd call her a slut. Do I have to spell it out? Karim, Dylan, Corentin, she's soiled! She's had a hard life. And it's her life, not yours, okay? You know what? The other night, Lily was having a drink with that movie guy. I saw them through the window, I swear. He's a big pervert! Is he screwing her? Shut up, guys, you don't know nothing! Hello. Can I come in? Hi, Jessy. You just turn up like that? Yes, I took the liberty. I'm sorry. I tried calling Mélodie, but... - I didn't see. - There was no answer. Here. I brought you this. What's that? For the Rémy gig. Pleased? Yeah. Well, I'll be going. - Have a nice evening. - Bye. Do you get off on filming a 16-year-old girl's ass? Right, right... Jessy, haven't you explained? - Get your fucking shit outta here! - Jessy, please, no! Get the fuck out! Jessy, not here! I don't wanna see you here! The guy's a flake! Fuck! Son of a bitch! There are kids here! He don't know who he's dealing with. What do you think? Is Gabriel a good guy or not? I dunno. You don't have to keep making the movie. Only do it for yourself, okay? Not for anyone else. I just want what's best for you. I know. Why do you get so angry all the time? It's always shaking. In my body. Shaking? Yeah. It's like my body's shaking inside all the time. Jessy: Were u at gabriel's hotel? Watch your reputation Lily: watch what ur saying how dare u talk to me like that? Fuck your mothers all of you spying on me you bastards You say we're spying? LOL! Just own up to what ur doing No one gives a shit If you wish to, close your eyes. Take a moment to accept yourself. What is your inner weather like? How do you feel? Rainy? Sunny? Cold? Warm? Humid? Windy? Breathe in deeply through the nose, then breathe out through the mouth. Okay, buddy? - Here they are! - Hello, Jean-Christophe. How are you? So, Monday's the big day? Well, what I want to say is that I'd like to thank... to thank very warmly everyone who's brought a pigeon, to be in the movie. Thank you, everyone. Thank you! All of you, have a drink on me! Véronique, this is Gabriel and the kid from the movie. - Véro, my wife. - Hello. - What can I get you? - An orange juice. - And you? - A local beer? It took some doing, 4,000 pigeons. It's quite a... - It'll be beautiful when they're let go. - Yeah, I think so. Here. Thank you. Cheers. - You're making a movie? That's good. - Yeah, yeah. It's not easy, but it's great. What's it about? A little boy, who's like you with pigeons. And I play the little boy. Keeping pigeons is his passion. And at the end he runs away from his sister's place. He runs away? Is it for TV or movie theaters? Theaters. That's fantastic. Well, let's hope so. Are you into pigeons? No, but I'm Flemish, so I have great respect for the sport. It's important to us. Yes, I hear a bit of an accent. A bit? It's very clear! Yeah. Yes, the Belgians are known for it. They're a great nation for pigeons. They used to be, anyway. A bit less nowadays, that's to be expected. But we in the north of France are here to beat you! These are for transporting them, as I was telling you. We note the numbers on the pigeon boxes, to see which ones are racing. We'll put them in the truck, and let them go on Monday. Simple! Is Mémère here? She's here, big fat Mémère. Look. Here she is. I'll grab her for you. There, look. Get a good grip. Like that. That's good, son. That's good. In any case, she won't fly away. She's only here for her male. It's the widowhood system. Do you remember? I explained that to you. I don't remember. I take the female away from the male, and show her to him just before the race. So that he'll hurry back to her? Exactly. He's thinking: "I have to get laid, I have to get laid!" She was struggling. Do you know what you want? Go crazy, huh. Whatever you want. Taco, chicken tenders, fries, and Hannibal sauce. You know, Ryan, I don't know what they said happened during the scene with Jessy and Lily, but I assure you that... I don't care, I wasn't there. I apologize, sorry. I'm exhausted, that's all. How are things at home? Does your sister take good care of you? Is it nice there? It's what I wanted, anyway. And your mom? Would you like to see more of her? She says she's better now. She wants to see me all the time. She wants me back. Are you mad at her? I don't really know her. And your dad? I never see him because he left my mom... when I was a baby. After that, she was in hospital a lot, because of the problems in her head. But also, I think I was too difficult to take care of. You know that I, well... it's not the same, not at all, in fact, but my mom... writes books and is very respected. But all she cares about is her work. And a mother who's never there... leaves blemishes. Whoever you are, wherever you're born... What are blemishes? Catastrophes. It creates a void. It stops you loving yourself. Do you tell your sister you don't want to see your mom? Not much. Trust in your feelings. Be angry when you have to be angry. You know how to do that. And cry when you need to cry. I don't cry. PIGEON KEEPERS OF SAINT-OMER Forget that it's a nightmare. For once you're not afraid of your gran. We have to get this in one take. Not two. We have no choice, buddy. So concentrate. It'll be... Come on. I trust you. Wait, wait. Ryan! Remember not to move when the pigeons are released. Don't disperse them. Like a statue. That's good, buddy. Hello, everyone! Do you hear me? We're rolling. Do we have sound? Yes, we have sound. Action! Cut! We really had a hard time getting the permit to film out there. I don't know if they were scared of all the pigeons. I don't think people are very enthusiastic about the movie you're making. Why? You know, the local charities, the social workers, and the councillors are all working hard to change the 'hood's image. And what you're doing here is stigmatizing it. So, yeah, some people are angry. Put yourself in our shoes. When you work here, you see that it's a lovely place, that the people are just like you, that they have their dreams... The girls in the gymnastics team are the best in the region. It'd be better to show them than hoodlums. I don't know if you realize, but they were picked from hundreds of children. So we're showing the treasures of the neighborhood, in a way. Yeah, but when you watch that, it looks like the Picasso neighborhood is just people struggling with poverty. That's not a good image. When we went to hold auditions in the schools, the guy at the board of education wouldn't let us. He said: "No, you can't." He wrote, in black and white: "Such children exist but you don't have to show them." - That's not nice. - Well, if... What you're telling me is sort of the same thing. No, we're not saying that. But what we're doing, day after day, is trying to lift the neighborhood up, favoring a better social mix, which means not discouraging more well-off people from moving here. But when you surf on the stereotypes, that's exactly what happens. Why didn't you use real actors? It's like a news report or something. And you only picked hoodlums. Bad seeds. Sorry, Graziella, but your kids aren't angels. Cheers, girls! Cheers! To Picasso! This is me and Mom's favorite! Bastard! You see what I mean? I don't know, but, you know, sometimes... Well, it depends. Well, I'm not exactly sure. I'm hesitating a bit. I'm in love with you. I'm... deeply in love with you. Really, you too? I got carried away! Okay? I'm in love with you. I'm thirty-two, Lily. Yeah, I know. I don't care. Sorry, but I'm not in love with you. Do you understand? Yeah, I understand. No, you don't understand. Where there's life there's hope! I wrote you a letter. Yeah? I want to read it to you. Can you listen? Hold on. I'm not sure it's a good idea. But I'll... I'll take it, and I'll read it, okay? Can we just make a promise? We don't talk about this again. Don't ask me what I thought. Okay? So embarrassing. No. Yes. No. It's fine, don't worry. I'm embarrassed too. - You sure blew me off there! - No, I didn't. It's... Dear Victor, I want to share my feelings with you. I can't stop thinking about you, the look in your eyes, your smile, your voice... You're the first person I've ever felt myself with. It's the first time I've ever wanted to be with someone. My heart beats wildly. When I go to sleep, I imagine that you're holding me and kissing me. When I realized you could hear me on the mic, I tried sending you messages. Did you get them? Did you hear me? I get the feeling you did. When I lost my brother, I thought I'd never have a positive emotion again. I was alive but lost. Since the shoot and meeting you, I've felt that it's possible again. All the guys I met before you were worthless losers. You see things differently, and I feel that you really understand me. Thank you for supporting me and telling me I was strong. When you're far from me, and I'm alone in my bubble, you're the only one in my heart. Seeking happiness, it ain't no dream The place in my heart is blocked by hate It's a jungle A last ray of sunshine on the plains All my life I've tried not to do bad... You having a good time? You can live a good life Breaking the chains! I live for tomorrow, fingers crossed Where's my lucky star? I'm stuck, wait for me Don't worry, it's gonna be okay I live for tomorrow, fingers crossed Where's my lucky star? I'm stuck, wait for me I live for tomorrow, fingers crossed Where's my lucky star? I'm stuck, wait for me... One more time! Why did you do it? Are you trying to hurt me? You know what it does to my tummy? Do you want me to miscarry? - Don't you want to be here for the birth? - I'm not your baby's father. You keep telling me that you love me. "I love you, I love you, I love you." You love me, but you don't care. You're always talking about your own problems. I didn't want to see you anymore. You're not there for me, I'm not there for you. I thought you were dead. Do you get that? I thought my little brother was dead. I love you. I love you too. I love you. See? I did the emotion! I did it. Romane dedicates this film to Irène.
