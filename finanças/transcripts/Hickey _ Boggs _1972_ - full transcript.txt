[HUMMING NOISE] [ANNOUNCEMENTS ON PA] [PEOPLE CHATTERING] [COINS CLINKING] Madre de Dios. Protect us now. [CAR HORN HONKING] [AUDIENCE CHEERING ON TV] TV ANNOUNCER: Laird seems to be taking most of those blows on his shoulders and elbows. Perkins appears to be pulling his left a bit. He just might have hurt that hand back in round two. If you joined us late, Perkins was down in round two for an eight count. [BELL CLANGING ON TV] And there's the end of round six. [SIGHS] [CLEARS THROAT] Did you pay the phone? [SIGHS] I gotta borrow. Against what? Well, my house is clear. [LAUGHS]Almost. No chance. Not that house. It's a good house.It's a terrific house. You promised me you'd find somebody. I said I would try. I gotta get rid of that house. Well, why don't you give it to somebody? I tried and the guy said maybe if I'd throw in my car. Had enough ready for the phone bill or the answering service? It's a good house.But not both. Now we can get a message. [STAMMERING] Incoming still works. What if we want to call out, you know? Return a message or something? Got an appointment in the morning. What's it about? It's not about anything so far. Just an appointment. Well... You can keep it, can't you? Yeah. Yeah. I'm going in the tank tonight, I think. Yeah. BALLARD: You know the Pittsburgh deal? The one we put in the dry file? BRILL: The one that disappeared? Yeah. Well, last night, Bernie and I were having dinner, and a guy waltzes over to the table. And drops this right in my lap. It's the woman. Quemando's woman. She's put one of those out to every fence in town. Like calling cards. She's trying to sell our bread. [ACCOUNTANT TAPPING ON CALCULATOR] There's no mistake? No. Not yet. Let's get some soldiers. Mr. Hickey or Mr. Boggs? Hickey. Mr. Boggs won't be joining us? Mr. Boggs is in the office this morning. How can we help you, Mr. Rice? [CHILDREN CHATTERING] [RINGING] Hello. Yeah. Sure. Right. No, you call Monte, then we'll get Fatboy. Right. Nick? Can I call my Mom? Sure, honey. It ought to be delicately done. It's been some time since I've seen her. Just to find her is all that's really necessary. I don't want you to contact her, you understand? [CHILDREN LAUGHING] She might shy away. Discretion. You know the sort of thing, I mean. Just find out where she is and let you know. Precisely. [CAR HONKING] Jack?Yeah? I'm taking the GTO, the special. Monte? The keys are atop the visor. You understand this may take some time. Well, not too very long, I trust. That leaves the question of money. Two hundred a day plus expenses. I see. Doing your bit for inflation. It was just a joke. Very well. My answering service number is on one of those pieces of paper. Call when you have something to report. Five hundred dollars. As an advance. A demonstration of my sincerity. Is that sufficient? I think so, Mr. Rice. Well... Arrivederci,Mr. Hickey. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] We'll be talking to you. [SWINGS SQUEAKING] [MAN LAUGHING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [PEOPLE CHATTERING] [DOOR CLOSES] HICKEY: We're working. I'm glad to hear it. I hate to bother you. It's all right, just wanted to take a minute. See this girl? What, does she put out? HICKEY: She's business, dummy. Mary Jane Bower. Yeah. Tell me about her.Some little sweet lips by the name of Rice wants us to find her. What for? A romantic connection. A switch-hitting Sweet Lips, huh? Yeah, well don't make fun of the client. We got a five bill retainer. Do you think money turns my head around? [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] [DOORBELL BUZZING] Farrow, Swope and what's this last one? Kay Mundo. That's Spanish I think. When was the last time Rice saw Mary Jane? Three weeks ago. I'll see Farrow. You look up Tina Swope. They were friends a few years ago. Rice don't like them anymore. He just wants Mary Jane. Well, it's his money. Yeah, well some of it's gonna be ours. Now, look, whenever you talk to any of these turkeys, Rice doesn't want you to mention his name. How's Nyona? Nyona who? They're lovely. Thank you. [DOORBELL BUZZING] WOMAN: Whatever it is, I don't want any, and neither does he. His shades are still down, he isn't even awake yet. You con-men are all alike. [DOORBELL BUZZING] [POLICE RADIO CHATTERING] PAPADAKIS: Who is he? Well, you could start by saying "hello." Hello. How's the public servant? I don't have time. Who is he? I think his name is Farrow. What were you doing here? Skip tracing a girl. He's a lead. By checking the mailbox I determined that Mr. Farrow lived at Apartment 1338A. Therefore using my uncanny reasoning ability, I then proceeded up the stairs to Apartment 1338A. SHAW: No goddamn jokes. Note to stenographer, strike Hickey's last remark and my comment. Just tell it straight. [MUSIC PLAYING ON TV] Anything? Oh, Tina Swope hadn't seen Mary Jane in a long time. Years. They used to go with a couple of brothers named Quemando. Mary Jane's boyfriend went to the can for armed robbery. A tough way to make a buck. So we'll go see the other Mr. Quemando tomorrow. Yeah.Okay. What about Farrow? He caught a bullet sandwich. What do you mean, he's dead?Yes, I found him. Were you gonna tell me about it? Well, by looking at the mailbox, I determined that Mr. Clifton Farrow lived in Apartment 1338A. What happened? Guy got blown up.Robbery? Doesn't look like it. He just opened up his door and got paid off. Who's got the paper? Most of it's on your desk. Shaw's still got Al Hickey's transcript. He found him.Who's Hickey? He used to be with the Hollenbeck Division. [WATER RUNNING] [TOILET FLUSHING] Hi. That's not funny, goddamn it. Your sense of humor is pathetic. God damn you. Don't stand there, throw me a towel. Quit gawking. Get outta here. Wait in the other room. I almost had a heart attack. You think everything you do is so cute. It's just a way of saying... Just wait in the other room. [COINS CLINKING] You feel better? What do you want? I want to see you. First time in three weeks. I've been working very hard. On who? [LAUGHS] Come on, honey, loosen up, will you? Now, look, I really don't like this. You walk in here like you live here. You live in Coxman Heaven now. You threw me out. I gotta stay someplace. With every hooker in town. You and that fag partner, you must be very happy together. [SIGHS] Look, I'm really ticked off about this, and you're not gonna smile at it. You want me to leave? Yes. Okay. I'll give you another chance. Not tonight. It's not free. You've got to earn it. Spare me the drama. [DOOR CLOSING] RICE: A woman named Tina Swope, although she's been inactive recently. A man named Bledsoe. There's a good possibility there. My former partner, Clifton Farrow, whom I know for a fact has been negotiating with this person, this woman. You must be very careful of him. Must we?Is that everybody? Not too many sources on the West Coast are capable of really huge transactions. How much is involved actually? Anyway, that is everyone who fences currency or buys currency in this area. Bernie, I've got a houseful of people. Charmaine is gonna kill me. I could call these people for you and suggest [TELEPHONE BUZZING]they refuse to do business with this woman. You want to pick this up? And you never heard of Mary Jane Bower? Not until now, no. I'm sorry. But, if I do... Excuse me. If I can be of any further help. We've taken up enough of your time already, Mr. uh... Good night, Mr. Rice. Thank you so much for your honesty. He's lying. I know. Doesn't matter yet. Get on this. Now. Tonight. [WATER RUNNING] [WOMAN GARGLING] [WATER DRAINING] [LIGHT SWITCH CLICKING] [RUBBING TOOTHBRUSH] [DOOR CLOSES] [SIGHS] [POLICE RADIO CHATTERING] No, no. BOGGS: If it's missing, it had to be reported stolen. I've got a report to make. Oh, here it is. Here, see? Well, a key is still a key, ma'am, and nothing else until it opens something. I'll have run it through regular lock tests. I'll have it back to you this afternoon, tomorrow at latest. If there has been a misunderstanding, and I hope that's all it is, it's my responsibility to get to the bottom of it. One less sports fan. [POLICE RADIO CHATTERING] Well, she's a nice lady. She's a little confused, that's all. When you release the apartment, would you give us a call. I'd like to look around, just on the off chance, you know, uh... We've got a job to do, too, okay? Yeah, right. Be sure you return the key now. Yeah, I just need some more sugar. [EXCLAIMS] Anything?No. The flower shop's closed. May I have a chili dog, please? Two. Three. Make it four and two cokes. Found this at Farrow's. Ellery Queen. I found those, too. Mother... Shame to turn 'em in. [CHUCKLES] Yeah. Let's call Rice first. I did. He checked his service off this morning. Closed the account. There's no forwarding number. Let's eat first. PAPADAKIS: Under the drainpipe, huh? Yeah, in the kitchen. You know any of these names?BOGGS: Nope. Hickey?HICKEY: We can't do all your work for you. How did you get in? Walked. The apartment is off limits. HICKEY: Well, cut the crap out, just say thank you. We would have found it. Yeah, sure, any month now. Just trying to help you boys out. All right, okay, my ears are bleeding. Check it out. Run it through. Have them put a jerk in it. Right. Get right on that, will you kid? Yeah, let us know if any thing comes up. [POLICE RADIO CHATTERING] Did you make a copy of that note? It's in my pocket.Papadakis will be ahead us this one. I hate giving those guys anything. Yeah, but if we didn't, he'd have us bare-hineyed and no license. We're only looking for Mary Jane. Yeah, I know, but still. [MACHINES GRINDING] [SHOUTING] [MEN CHATTERING] [DOOR CLOSING] Can I help you gentlemen? Mr. Quemando. That's right. We're private investigators, Mr. Quemando. That mean you're not real cops? [MAN LAUGHING] We're looking for Mary Jane Bower. You seen her? We're just looking for her. There's no trouble. I haven't seen her in five years, maybe more. I just sell flowers. [MARY JANE SOBBING] Looks like we got no Mary Jane and no client. HICKEY: This is what you copied off Farrow's note? It's three names. Addresses on the back. [COUGHS] These guys look like they mean it. Let's check out this address. [CAR ENGINE STARTING] [GRUNTS] Tell us where she is. [GROANING] [GLASS SHATTERING] [BABY CRYING] [PIANO PLAYING] Hold on a second. [ELEVATOR DOOR OPENING] Place is rented to a Marie Florida or Floreda. Nobody's seen her in a few days. Fourth floor, rear. You turned on the personality. [CHUCKLES]Yeah. [EXHALES]And 50 big ones. The cops were here this afternoon. Nobody home. They'll be back. Yeah. I see you got your money's worth. Yeah, if any heat shows up, she's gonna buzz us. Yeah, I hope so, for $50. Not many clothes. A girl of slender means. [PHONE RINGING] Yes. Yes, thank you. It's three guys. They're already on this floor. [DRAWER CLOSING] [GLASS BREAKING] [MOUTHING] [DOOR CLICKING] [CUTLERY CRASHING] Here! Behave! [CRASHING] [SCREAMING] [CRASHING] [WOMAN SCREAMING] Goddamn, son-of-a-bitch! [METALLIC CLANKING] Frank, will you come on. [CAR ENGINE STARTING] My God! [PEOPLE SHOUTING] [EXHALES] Good morning.Hello, firebug. Anything? We got a registered letter. Well, that looks like good news. No, not really. Rice has given us the gas. He's taken us off salary. Maybe Rice has found Mary Jane. It doesn't say that. I think he got scared off. I like your style. What the hell else we got to do? Now look, I'll go back and see the florist, you stay on Rice. See if you can run him down. You're gonna wear that? Al. Did you ever kill anybody? In the United States. Because I know you mean it and everything, but, I know these guys better than I know you. They're soldiers, that's all. No questions, no time to ask, no talk. Cops are worse and less predictable. If you pull a gun, you gotta be ready to kill somebody. I'm telling you it's better to run. You finished? You want to tell Papadakis about last night? Well... [DOOR CLOSES] Yes sir, I like your style. [WOMAN CHATTERING ON PA] You got a location on Papadakis? Well, get him back. No, this is the real thing. Bob. Put out a call. Bring in Al Hickey and Frank Boggs. No, not an arrest. [POLICE RADIO CHATTERING] What the hell is going on here? This money is so hot, It'll burn a hole in the side walk. Two people dead. Six dead in Pittsburgh. Every time something comes up, you two are part of the woodwork. Now, I want it all. Don't strain your windpipe. I'm warning you, don't play around. Now who's playing around? We brought the money in. What the hell were you doing heeled? An ounce of prevention. We got a license or not? So far. Well, what do you need? What about the florist? It's a lead from Rice. Two leads, two dead men. We live in troubled times. That's right, there's a lot of social unrest. You find Rice? That's the next thing. We haven't either. Well, what about Pittsburgh? Last winter, Federal Reserve Bank, three guards killed, three torpedoes killed, driver got away with a sack of money. Big bills. Over 400,000. Driver got shot full of holes. They didn't find the money or his girlfriend. What was her name?SHAW: We don't know that. Is there a reward for this? Twenty-five thousand. I want to go over this from the top. Anything you need. [MAN CHATTERING ON TV] Mary Jane can't get rid of that dough. The bills are too big, can't spend it. Don't bother with that now, we're going to the game tomorrow. Farrow was a bagman. She was trying to unload that dough at knock down rate... I said we're going to the game, now relax and enjoy this good... What game? Rams, Falcons. Oh, football... I favor the Rams myself. I thought the game was a sell out. It is. We're looking for Mary Jane Bower, not Roman Gabriel. Twenty-five thousand dollars. What kind of odds do you want? On the Rams? On Mary Jane being at the ballgame. [MAN SHOUTS] FOOTBALL PLAYER: Hut, two... [FOOTBALL PLAYERS GRUNTING] [WHISTLE BLOWING] [CROWD CHEERING] [ANNOUNCEMENT ON PA] [FOOTBALL PLAYERS SHOUTING] [REFEREE BLOWING WHISTLE] [CROWD CHEERING] I thought she'd show today. Try to make a hit. Let me see that.Hmm, oh. Farrow had the same thing written beside his phone. "Rams, Falcons, plus one." And these seats.Plus one what? Whoever they are hitting on, I guess. Plus one day? [SIGHING] What, tomorrow? [EXCLAIMS] I don't know. Well, they'd have to set a time. The ticket could key it. Game time. These seats. Plus one day.Yeah, well. [RINGING] Hello. Oh, Christ no, I don't wanna talk. I wanna sleep. You only seem to remember my phone number at bedtime. Had to work at a football game. Well, you should have taken me. Sure, anything we gotta do, we can do at the ballpark. [ANNOUNCEMENTS ON PA] [CAR ENGINE STARTING] Let me see that again. [BOGGS SIGHS] There's only two people in a buyoff like this. Three's dangerous. Why the third seat? What is this? Nothing.Well, it says "Edith." She's got a new phone. You seeing her again? I quit paying her the alimony and she's broke. She needs help. Well, what happened to the boyfriend with the big house in Westwood? Whatever it was, it happened yesterday. She was still there the night before. Well, maybe she found a bigger... Guy with a bigger house. No. She's been asking for her old job back. So, he threw her out. Gee, I wonder why. All right. [BANGING] MONTE: This the only wagon? Okay. And let's not lose this one, eh? [CAR ENGINE REVVING] [LAUGHS] What? My house was too small. Yeah, I know, you told me. Hey! All right, Chief. [GUNS FIRING] [TIRES SCREECHING] [PEOPLE CHATTERING] [SIRENS WAILING] How are we supposed to explain this? To the Rams? The cops. I'll think of something. [PHONE RINGING] Thank you, sir.Good luck, sir. Soon as you can, right. Thank you. [BALLARD WHISTLING] We picked up a bonus. They didn't get the girl? The girl didn't show. The soldiers nailed a buy-off. They burned up the bagman so, there's still no way to find out who she's dealing with. [SIGHING] I don't wanna lose her. Keep pushing. Right. It's messy, but we have no choice. It belongs to us. The original stake was ours. If I can't stick to a principle, I can't believe in anything. Right. Boggs saw the note by Farrow's phone. We figured it might lead to Mary Jane. We figured Mary Jane might have had an appointment with Farrow. Why didn't you call us in? Cause it was a long shot. How did the torpedoes find out about it? They beat it out of Quemando. What the hell is this? You know, they know and we don't? You shoot up the Coliseum, blow off a hit. A bagman's dead, bodies lying all over LA. You two bums made a grandstand play. Well, you should have been out there backing us up. You had Farrow's note. Come off it. You two held out on us. You know it and we know it. Charging us? I'd like to.If I come up with anything else, I'll push you both so hard, you'll be sweating silver bullets. You hear me? Yeah, we got ears. [EXHALES] If they tie us to the hotel, we're done. Yeah. We're gonna find that bitch before they do. Shoe salesman, short order cook. A lot of jobs open for ambitious young men. Let me see Farrow's note. I want to check those other two names. Philip Bledsoe, Elena Cole and in parenthesis, a "Mr. Leroy." Just names, just names. Then we start with the phone book. We gotta find that bitch. Well, that's so when you grow up you'll know a lot of stuff. And besides, what are you gonna do all day when the kids are back in school? [LAUGHS] No, I don't need a secretary, but if I ever need one, you're it. [DOORBELL RINGING] [DOOR OPENING] My name is Boggs. Uh, I'd like to see Mrs. Cole. Elena Cole. Could you tell me what you want? I want to talk about Clifton Farrow and Mary Jane Bower. Would you mind waiting here, please. No, you must have had a tooth under there. Sure. You had to have a tooth under there. Sure, everybody knows that. More teeth, more bread. Well, you could knock 'em out with a stick or you could get a pair of pliers. [CHUCKLES] You're welcome, sweetheart. I love you, too. Except I can't say it cause it's embarrassing. Will you ask your Mom to call me? Yes. Please be good. All right, hang up, dear. All right, bye, bye. [PHONE RINGING] Hello. Step this way please. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Boggs? Now, what kind of name is that, brother? Irish. Black Irish? Mostly. All right. Lester. Get him a chair. Be at home. Ah, go ahead, be at home. Now, what can I do for you? Okay? All lined up for the corner. Right? Keep loose there. Atta girl. Now. She wants to do business. When? Tonight. Call the troops. You're taking things pretty calm. Yeah. Anything happen? I couldn't find Bledsoe. Uh, I ran down Mrs. Cole. What's her story? Civil rights nut, women's lib. No kids, widow. Up north at the moment trying to retake Alcatraz. Costs a lot of bread. Enough to keep Mr. Leroy and a houseful of folks. [SIGHS] What about him? He's the leader of his people. Oh, man. And where is he leading these lucky people? Up La Brea from Watts to Bel Air. Leroy. Bald? Wears sunglasses in the house? Yeah. Yeah. Heavyweight. Ghetto superstar. Anyway. BOGGS: Anyway nothing. Farrow did some decorating of some kind for Mrs. Cole. Nobody ever heard of Mary Jane. So, we're cooked. [COUGHS] We got nowhere to go. No client. No suspect, no leads. No clues, nothing. HICKEY: Anyway, you'll never guess who called. Who? Mary Jane. She wants to see us tonight. Said she's scared and wants to give up. If we help her, why then, we can get the reward. I'll be goddamned. Right. But she lies a lot. How the hell did she get our number? Could only come from Sweet Lips. So... [TOILET FLUSHING]He's found her, all right. Black community is not trying to become something new. [CHUCKLES] Is in fact still basically white in its behavior, psychologically. That's why my leader, our leader, keeps saying over and over again that black power cannot be jealous of white power. It has to be sick of it. It has to know... Four car spaces behind the green ball plot 32. The start of the eighth inning. The back seat of the blue Thunderbird. Yes my dear, she will be there. A punto,as they say. Exactly. It worked. All her sources have been frightened away by the stupid monsters. They're not stupid. She has to do business with us, at our price. Tonight. I told you I can do it. She's desperate, that nasty bitch. Desperate, nasty bitches are dangerous, brother. It will work. I'm sending Phillip. In drag. [AUDIENCE CHEERING] [ANNOUNCEMENTS ON PA] That's the top of the eighth. Hey. That's her. [GUN COCKING] Go. Hello. Mary Jane? Hold it. [GUNS FIRING] [SCREAMS] Shut that door! Shut the door, you idiot. [TIRES SCREECHING] BOGGS: Five hundred cars in the lot, and the bastards blow up mine. Well, tit for tat. Some Mary Jane. What?It's Bledsoe. The guy we couldn't find. I gotta get a bigger gun, I can't hit nothing. How we gonna explain this one? Well, this time, we need a lawyer. [SIRENS WAILING] That bitch set us up. [PHONE RINGING] Yeah. [COUGHS] Wait. Wait a minute, wait a minute. [BABY CRYING]What are you talking about? PAPADAKIS: The Katzenjammer kids, they just blew up Dodger Stadium. Another bagman's dead. This time we got the money. No girl. They missed the torpedoes. What's their excuse? Hickey claims he got a call from the girl. She said she wouldn't show if they called us in. I want them busted. Withholding evidence, abetting felonious conduct. And burn them. Put a stake up both of them. [BABY CRYING]Now, I'll call Sacramento tonight, set a hearing, suspend their licenses, break 'em, put 'em away. Mmm-hmm. BOGGS: We gave 'em every piece, but we could have kept that two grand. We turned it in and we went to the police department. LAWYER: Well, how about giving me some evidence I can use? BOGGS: Well, if you'd get it thrown out. [LAUGHING] Thrown out? BOGGS: What the hell do we pay you for anyway? LAWYER: They've got you by the biscuits. Pull some strings or something. Trump something up, can't you? I'm a lawyer, not a magician. HICKEY: We're gonna have to stand trial? Unless they drop the charges. I don't know. [TOILET FLUSHING] What? It's time to get out. Out of what? There's nothing left of this profession, Frank. It's all over. It's not about anything. LAWYER: Well, he's right. No such thing as a private investigator anymore. With the legislation coming out of Sacramento the last couple of years, you guys are nothing but process servers. It's not about anything. BOGGS: Yeah, it is. It's about 400 grand. Well, we gotta find that bitch. They've really got you up against it. Yeah. Well, that's what's known as pushing, they're pushing. What are you gonna do? Just have to push back and keep going. I'll come to your place after work. Uh, you will? [LAUGHS] I'll wait for you. Yeah, that's nice. Yeah. Things are looking up. You call them soldiers. You call them soldiers. They missed. Two cars blown to goddamn hell. They missed. Outgunned by two pencil necks. Tell me, how could they? Explain it. I want to hear how they missed. What is it? Dumbness? Yellow? [R AND B MUSIC PLAYING] What the hell do you come in here for? The music. [LAUGHS] I think they got your beer. [PAPER CRACKLING] Come on, let's buy you a car. [GRUNTS] First you're gonna sell my house and now you're gonna buy me a car. I'm gonna buy you a goddamn car if you lay off about the house. It was a good house. Was. It still is. At least it's not falling off a cliff. Well, where's your word, so you can get the insurance for it? Ah, it's too late, it ran out. Look. Everybody in this town is about to burn us up. You can't go bad on me now. Frank, don't you get it? Our pictures are in all the newspapers. They are going to bury us. One side or the other. Edith is here. Edith is here. She'll be on in a minute and then we'll go. I thought she was barred from here? Guy owed me a favor.

She figures whichever one of us is dead, she's better off. She sacrificed two bagmen. That means she's got somebody to sell it to. Can you see? [SIGHS] Mary Jane had a big deal with the florist's brother. The one in jail, he's at Chino. I'm going down there tomorrow morning, poke around. You're still short one car. Yeah, I'll work something out. What about you? I'll start with the house at the beach. Last go round.That's right. Can you see? How does it run? Terrific. I'll take it. [GUN COCKING] [PHONE RINGING] Yeah. Yeah, listen, the torpedoes hit my place. Pulled it apart. They may be on their way to see you. They weren't after anything, not really. It's not a good job. They got a kick out of it, like revenge. They've already been here. [EXCLAIMS] Goddamn college boys, in the middle of the night, we're gonna clean house. BALLARD: He walked in. He says he wants to come home. I think he's right. But I also think he owes us a lot of interest. I think he owes us another bonus. QUEMANDO: They said, we have to go through with it. The deal with Rice and the black man. [SIGHS] What are you doing here? [INAUDIBLE] Nyona's not here. She's dead and you killed her. And I don't want you around this child ever again. You're a rotten... [INAUDIBLE] I know from the moment you walked into this house two years ago that you're a rotten, low down, son-of-a-bitch. And I mean it. I don't ever want to see your face again. Ever again. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] [PEOPLE LAUGHING] Is it all set? Yep. Good. No more misses. No more mistakes. All right. [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING] You all right? Good. I've been to Chino. Quemando got out, on parole, day before yesterday. A woman met him. She signed in as Mary Florida Quemando. Wife. Bingo. I got their address from the parole officer. So, okay, we're in business. Let's go get 'em. I know you want the torpedoes. We find the woman, they're gonna be close. Oh, look goddammit, they're not coming in here. [CHUCKLES] It's a chance. It's a chance. Okay, you quit. Fine. Just lay down and roll over right here. It's a nice place for you to do it. At least we're not going to be thirsty. Bob. Let's have one. Right here please. Because I'm joining my friend and partner. [BLOWING SMOKE] [CHUCKLING] "Oh, Frank. "Frank, you can't go bad on me now. "They're gonna bury us "just because you can't get this dumb, "stupid, pitiful bitch out of your guts." Look who's talking. You just sit there 'cause I'm gonna go get them. I want that 25. You can sit there for a long time, but you can't bring her back. And you can't make up for what you missed. All... Only thing you can do is goddamn try to even it up. Make it right. Now I'm going out there and I'm gonna get 'em. So... [KNOCKING ON DOOR] [GROANING] [GUN COCKING] Now you tell me where she is. Tell me where she is or I'm gonna kill you. [GUN COCKING] BOGGS: He will. Don't be depressed. You got nothing to cry about. It's very difficult to run a $400,000 caper from a prison cell. You did pretty good. You still got Mary Jane. She must be a heck of a woman. Killed Farrow for you cause he wanted a bigger bite, ran the whole show till you got out. She's one hell of a woman. Course you'll both be indicted, but it's too shaky, they won't make it stick. So... Maybe you'll still get home. He's telling you things could be a whole lot worse. Think about it. Mr. Rice, say hello to Mr. Boggs. Mr. Rice. Mr. Leroy. Say hello to Mr. Hickey. It really fell off the cliff, huh? That's a shame, but my partner has a hell of a deal for you. Terrific house, fine neighborhood. [CAR DOOR OPENING] You listen to him. You just do what Mr. Hickey tells you. I'm gonna do everything just as it was set up. [CAR DOORS CLOSING]Okay?
