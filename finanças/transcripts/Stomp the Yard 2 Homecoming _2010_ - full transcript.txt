Hey, Chance, I may need you to work tonight. I can't, my line is up tonight. I told you that. Not that you listen. Look... ...I'm moving into the Theta house, and so is Wynn. Boy, you move around more than a brother at a Klan rally. Just moved back in and you're moving out already. It's not like that. I'm just moving right down the street. Whatever. I'm here to stay this time, so don't you go trying to get rid of me. Look, Pop, just hear me out, okay? I really wanna do this. I joined a team. - I'm putting them moves to use. - Sounds like a distraction. You promised when you came home your focus would be education. It is. That's what I'm trying to tell you.

Face it, Dane, you're gonna lose. You're gonna lose huge. Yeah. It's been two years. When you graduate, they're gonna remember you as a failure. Yo, Taz. Taz. - What you gonna beat us with, man? - Hey. - Hold your line. - Threats? Yeah, Chance, hold your line. That's your new mascot, right? Is that who that is? Oh, the Rock Star, huh?

Theta Nu. I love this! Show-stopping. I can't wait to win one of these bad boys on Sunday. Whoa, whoa, whoa, man. Put this thing down. We gonna have one soon enough, kid. - Yes, yes, yes. - Soon enough. - Yo, I'm not so sure. - What? There's a reason why we haven't won one since then. Mus were better tonight. I mean, they had some hot moves, man. They did. If we don't step our game up, we're gonna get destroyed on Sunday. We can say goodbye to the scholarship and the money. Don't know about y'all, but I could use it. Tuition is crazy, but no way we're gonna get Dane to change the routine. But why not? Why not? I mean, think about it. Theta's been doing the same routine since before I left Truth last year. - I can come up with something better. - Really, Chance? Really? We just got the frat. We just got in-- Hey, Roy, what's going on, man? We just got into the frat. You wanna rock the boat? Come on, man, that's not a good look. It's not. It's not. One thing's for sure, we're gonna lose if you keep stepping on my feet. Man, forget all of that. Tell Nikki to hook us up with her sorors. - Pass the ball. Pass the ball. - No. I'll be right back. - Come on, stop being greedy. - Jeez. Theta what? - Theta Nu. - Theta Nu. - What's up, baby? - Come here, baby. I can't stick around... ...because I gotta check on the floats for homecoming. But I wanted to say congratulations. You were amazing. Well, I do what I can do. All right, all right, don't get all gassed. I'll see you later, right? Of course. Okay. - Let's go. - All right. Hey, can I talk to you for a second? What's up? What happened at the pep rally earlier was unacceptable. And I think you know that. I wasn't gonna stand back and watch Taz disrespect us. But what you did was disrespectful to me and to the frat. Look, Chance, you're a Theta now, and we expect a lot more from you. Believe me, nobody wants to outdo Taz more than I do. You let me handle him. Understand? My man. - Fellas, keep form. - All right. I wanna hear it. I wanna hear it. Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? That's all you got? - I'm trying. - Not trying hard enough. We have until Sunday, you guys, to get that routine together. Okay? Or we're gonna lose. Is that what you want? - We're gonna lose anyway. - I'm sorry, you say something? I didn't hear you. You got something to say? Do you have something to say, Neo? - The Mus were dope the other night. - I don't give a damn about the Mus. If you have a point, damn it, you better make it. Look, a few of us was thinking that maybe... ...we should step our game up a little bit. - We doing the stuff from last year. - So now what? - Maybe I should just show you. - Yeah, maybe you should. Dane. Dane, we don't got time for this, man. No, no, be cool, boy. Let the boy have the floor. Let's see what he's made of. All right. We could still incorporate the same moves from our last routine... ...but it doesn't hurt to have a ace up our sleeves. For those of you who wanna incorporate Chance's choreography... ...into the routine, raise your hands. Looks like you guys better get started. - Yeah, thank you. All right. - Oh, yeah. You gonna put our fate in the hands of a Neo? I'll be damned if I let Taz win this. Maybe he can give us the edge that we need. That's all I'm saying. I hope you're right. Yes, yes, yes. Show me what you got there, man. That's it. I didn't call a break. You got a routine, you better show it. - All right. - So let's go, let's go. - Morning, Terry. - Hey, Shorty. - Chance in yet? - Course not. One more time. Wynn, stay with me. Remember that right leg. All right, y'all, one more time. Daredevil, I see you. Right leg. - One more time. All right, come on. - No, no, no. That's enough, that's enough. Yo, so good job. I admit it still needs a little bit of work. Don't think this gets you off the hook. Still have community service this afternoon. On homecoming weekend? Come on. - Thought it was all about stepping? - And girls. Learn to step, get as many girls as you want. Come on, let's go. I'll see y'all later. - Yo, what time is it? - It's 11:00. Damn. I gotta go. - Good morning, come on in. - Good morning. Janice. All right. Nice to see you. Good morning. Come in. I don't even wanna hear it. Come on. Get ready. Dad, practice ran over. I'm sorry. - Dad, I said I was sorry. - Look, Chance, I don't wanna hear it. I already told you how important this weekend is, didn't I? Just get ready. - Here you go. - Thank you. You guys enjoy. Chance, my office, now. Sit down. Look... ...you didn't re-enroll in Truth just to slack off. Slack off? I'm here every day trying to help you out. I'm entering the show so I can win scholarship money. That frat is not a priority. Look... ...when your mom died... ...you ran out of here with no money and no plan. You left me to handle this restaurant. Now that you're back home, I wanna see you take some responsibility... ...to see this thing through. I'm not trying to run your life. I've always tried to be supportive of you. Now I need you to be supportive of me. - Pi. - Delta. Pi Delta Mu step. I gotta admit, man, your girl is getting it in right now, Chance. She looking kind of fly too. All these fly honeys here, and you gotta check out my girl. What's the matter, man? You worried about all this big Wynn? Don't do that. And I'm good. I ain't worried about nothing. - Come on. - Maybe you should, dude. - Home-wrecker, 7 o'clock. - Hi. Man, you better run. We are the Pi Delta Mus, and not only are we smart and beautiful... ...we also know how to get down and dirty. My girls are about to show you something y'all need to see. - Pi Delta Mu step. - Chance. Pi Delta Mu step. Pi Delta Mu step. Aren't you happy to see me? Slow it down. Come on. - Get it, girls. - She's cuter than last year. - Is it serious? - What do you want, Brenda? I don't know. You're just kind of on my mind. I never got a chance to explain myself. Hey, hey, hey. It's been a year. Why now? Because it's not the same without you. I kind of miss you and me. You know... ...me and you did have some good times. Wasn't all easy sailing. You see, when I needed you the most... ...you wasn't even there. Too busy hooking up with Taz to notice. I deserve that. I do. But when your mom died, you shut me out. And then you transferred schools in Florida. What was I supposed to do? You know, you're a real piece of work. Everybody makes mistakes, Chance. Same number, right? - Hey, babe. - Hey. - Did you see us? - You guys did good. - Yeah? - Yeah. - How good? - Real good. - Proud? - Real proud. Let's go, baby. Okay. Could you just drop me at the stadium? I gotta check on some stuff for the game. Of course. I was on the way to Ashby anyway. Ashby? For what? I got a little community-service gig. All the Neos have to do it. Look at you, getting involved. I thought you were too cool for that. Chance. Yo, man, watch it. - What's wrong? - Nothing. - Nothing? You almost ran a stop sign. - Look, relax, okay? I'm just a little nervous, baby. That's it. Okay? Now, let's get out of here. If I'm late, I have to hear from Dane. I must say, man, the way you got at Dane this morning... ...that was kind of gangster, man. Now you're just gonna have to follow through. - What's that supposed to mean? - You got Dane to change the routine. That's big. Just think about it. If we win on Sunday, oh, we be living legends, man. Well, well... ...if it isn't the Thetas' new mascot and his sidekick, Old Yeller. I know you ain't talking with all that possum around your neck. You know what? Your jokes could use an upgrade. They're getting kind of old. Yeah, kind of like them dance steps you do. You spit a good game at the rally, but I hope you can back that up. Last night was just a taste of what I'm bringing. When it's all said and done... ...we'll see who walks away with the trophy and the money. Me. Trophy on one arm and your girl on the next. Because she'll realize you're a sucker, kind of like Brenda did. It sucks, but these things happen, you know? - You see that? - Yeah. You talking about that Brenda? Oh, wait, wait. - Now, that sucks. - Hey. - It ain't worth it. - That sucks. It does. Sucks. Now we gonna get back to work. You fellas have a good day. Hey, you gonna help us clean up? Come on, we need all the help we can get. Come on. It's homecoming weekend. Truth University, make some noise. Yeah. Can't see me. Can't see me. Can't see me. Wow, all right, all right, all right. Okay. Yo. We got some bumping and grinding going on down there. Somebody is trying to get some homecoming nookie. What are you doing? Come on, man. Yo, Chance. You had a lot of mouth earlier. Ready to back up that trash you were talking? Yo, yo, yo, you guys really wanna do this right now? Oh, my bad. I mean, he was just bragging pretty hard. I just figured he might need a chance to warm up. - Is that right? - Yeah, that's right. We got nothing to prove. We good here. - Come on, let's get a drink. - Yeah, I figured as much, man. But, you know, whenever you're ready to let the dog off the leash.... - I think I'm ready now. - Chance. - No, no, no. Let's go. - Yeah. You're gonna do this now? Hold up. I'm seeing an impromptu battle jumping off. Theta versus Mus. Keep it peaceful. This is homecoming, y'all. This is homecoming, remember? Hey, yo. Yo. Hey, yo, chill. - Hey, man. - Hey, watch out. - Yo, this ain't over. - Damn right, you sorry-ass loser. - Get off. - What's wrong with you? - I mean, come on. - Man. Give me my hat. Where my keys at? - Don't look over here. - Sorry, my bad. Chance, what are you trying to prove? God, you are killing me. Check it out. We all have to be on that stage Sunday. Take your revenge out there. Get in the car. I left my sweater inside. Honey, did you see how they was dancing at that party? - This day, I can't even deal. - Really. Why you didn't tell me my eyebrows was looking crazy? I need serious tweezing. - It's Wynn. - Serious tweezing, honey. Look your phone ain't here, all right? What was your deal earlier, man? It'd be nice if you'd think of the frat... ...before you show how to make us all look crazy. - Honey, what is it? - Text from Brenda. Oh, hell, no, Nikki. - Like, for real, call her right now. - Rena, I'm not gonna call her. - One more time. - Your phone is not here. - And I promise this is it. - Yo, your girl's outside. You found my phone. That's why you my-- What's wrong? Who were you tonight? - Because it's not the Chance I know. - Look, I know. And I'm sorry. I guess it's true what they say. You never really know a person, huh? I mean, baby, it's really not that serious, okay? I-- Chance, you told me you were over Brenda. Look, how many times do I have to tell you? I'm not thinking about that girl. I want nothing to do with her. I saw the texts, Chance. You're saying you went through my phone? - You lied to me. - I didn't lie to you. Brenda pushed up on me. And I told her-- Told her what, Chance? You told her no? Or maybe? Know what? - Maybe I'm not good enough for you. - Don't-- No, no, no. Because ever since day one, you never trusted me. Don't you dare. Don't you dare turn this around on me, because this is about you. Your inability to make a decision about what you want. You're the new hot thing on campus and everybody wants a piece, right? Well, I refuse to play second fiddle to any girl. I'm sorry. Look, I don't know what else to say. - Hello? - You busy? No. Why? I was thinking we could have that conversation. in person. - Where's Taz? - Where's Nikki? I'm outside. Don't you ever wonder what that would be like? If you hadn't left? It's a party, y'all. Not me. What's up, playboy? Let me holler at you for a minute. - Yeah, what's up? - I was looking for Chance. He's not here. You think I'm playing with you, partner? Well, this here be Theta property. I think you got the wrong house. I said, I think you got the wrong house. I get it. Get him. - Yo, I got your back. - Man, don't-- Yo, what? Dane, come on, man. - Come on. - Let's go! Come on, dude. - I said, let's go! - Let's get out of here. Oh, my God. What's up? You all right? Come on, baby, talk to me. Talk to me, baby. Ty, go in the house, go in the house. Get some help. What's the matter? I can't do this. - This ain't right. - You know what? You can... ...because it is right... ...and easy. I already know... ...everything you like. Hello? Dane? Hold on, so y'all telling me they tried us right on our front yard? Y'all know how lame that makes us look? - Yo, what the--? - Ain't no way-- Whoa, yo! Guys, cool out. Let me think this through. What happened? Yo, Wynn, you okay? Yeah, I'm all right. I'm on my way to the hospital now. I sure hope that doctor's cute. These guys came to the house looking for you. You have any idea who they were? How the hell would I know? I wasn't here. Really? Because they came asking for you by name. Why the hell would somebody wanna come after you? Man, I don't know. But it could've been anybody. - Probably one of Taz's boys. - These cats were straight hood. - Straight up. - Yeah. Yeah, he lied about it, but I kind of think you overreacted a little bit. You know Brenda. I honestly think she's just chasing after him. - Well, he's not running. - That don't mean he did anything. Come on. You seen her at that party the other night. She was jocking him kind of hard. And I'm letting you know now... ...it ain't the first time and won't be the last. Why'd he lie if he wasn't doing anything wrong? Because he's a man, sweet cakes. That's just what men do. All right, look. Give it some time... ...see how the weekend goes, and he'll come around. I trust you. Cheers. Yo, Rock Star. - All right? - Yeah, fine. You should see him, though, you know? What's up? Have to tell you something. Couple of weeks ago, I got hustled at a dance battle. Now they're gunning for me. Are you trying to tell me that this... ...is because of you? So why didn't you say anything? I don't know. I guess-- I guess I was scared to get kicked off the team. I really, really needed to win this competition. Are you serious? That's what you're worried about? I mean, you've always been kind of selfish, but this is ridiculous. Something about you changed. My whole life has changed. Ever since my mom died, I-- Don't put this on your mother. Don't. Everything has always been about Chance Harris. And it's been that way since we were little. I'm your boy, Chance. You should've come to me. - Hey. - Hey, girl. So I heard there was, like, a huge fight at the Theta house last night. The little dude you was dancing with at the club last night, where he at? Do I know you? I really thought you college boys was a little bit smarter than that. - Answer the damn question. - What you want with him? - Anybody hurt? - Wynn got himself beat up. It really ain't none of your business. But let's just say he owe me. - What about Chance? - I don't know. You like catfish? What are you doing here? I thought you should be home resting up. And miss my first game as a Theta? Come on, man. I thought it'd be nice if my best homey would roll with me. Plus it's hard for a handicapped brother. I couldn't get one honey. Just one honey to just help your boy out, I swear. - Still ain't got that boy laid yet? - Oh, really, Shorty? Really? That's what we're doing? It's not that simple. Don't ruin your homecoming weekend pining over some guy. - It screams desperation. - You're the one that has me worried. You told me something happened to him. Don't worry about Chance. He's fine. - Excuse me? - He's fine. It's a good thing he wasn't at the house when the fight went down. - And how do you know that? - Because he was with me. Why you let that girl get to you? She get her life making people miserable. - She's doing a good job. - That's not the point. Damn, man, you came kind of deep this year. Ladies. Man, look, can you please hold up, man? I could use some help. This is not cool. Hey. Nikki, baby. - I wanna talk to you. - No. Don't ''baby'' me. Congratulations, you finally made a choice. Nikki. Nikki! Can I help you? - We're looking for Chance. - What you want with him? - Go back and see if he in the back. - Y'all can't go there. - Move, lady. - He's not here. - I'm gonna have to ask y'all to leave. - He's not here. This place is filthy. I think you guys should clean it up. - Yo, what's going on here? - Chance. You all right? Go outside. Go outside. Yo, you came after my people, dawg. - That shit wasn't necessary. - Actually, I came for you. - Where's my money, Chance? - Look, I don't owe you no money. I told you that. You know this. You played in the streets. You made the bet. So either you have my money... ...or you don't. Hey, hey, hey! All right, all right. Give me till Sunday after the competition. I'll get you your money. - Think that's good enough? - Just give me till Sunday. Now, hold on, hold on, hold on. Let him go. So let me ask you a question. What makes you think you can win? Look, just trust me, I got this. Word on campus is the Mus are gonna win. That's who I got my money on. Is y'all betting on a stepping? But now you're talking about messing all that up. Tomorrow the Thetas better lose. You don't have a choice, fish boy. Let's go. - Are you all right, Chance? - I'm okay, I'm okay. I'm good. What happened? My place is ruined. - I'm gonna fix this. - Fix what? - I got into trouble. - Trouble? - Dance battle. These guys hustled me. - You know these people? - Yes. - What did you get into? - Trouble. - You have to do with this? Yes. I'm trying to tell you-- - What are you trying to tell me? - You never listen. That's why I don't come to you. I said I'll fix it, I'm gonna. You're gonna fix what? What are you gonna fix, Chance? What are you gonna fix? Yo, Thetas, look who I found. DJ! - DJ. - DJ. Theta! What's up, man? Good to see you. - Good to see you, brother. - Yo, I'm glad you made it. - Hey, what's up, Neo? That's my chair. - That's a legend right there. - What you been up to? - Man, working, man. Struggling, striving, grinding. - You know, you know. - Oh, yeah. Chance. Look who fell through. - DJ? - Last time I checked. - What's up? - What you doing here? Came to check you out, make sure Dane's preserving the legacy. Come on, you know I'm holding it down. Yeah, and I'm holding down your mama, so we good. - You too? - Me too. Seriously, man, I'm excited to see you on Sunday. My man Chance, he helped us freak the routine for Sunday's competition. - Gonna be hot. - That's what I like to hear. Actually, that's what I wanna talk to you guys about. Yo, what you talking about? A few weeks ago, I got hustled at a dance battle, 5 grand. So everything that happened last night was because of me. They're gonna come after me if I don't throw the competition. Look, I never meant to get you guys involved in this mess, and I'm sorry. Especially to you, Wynn. And you never thought to say something before? - Maybe we could've done something. - Like what? Pay them off? Fight them? No, I'm good. - Handle it myself. - You don't have that choice, Chance. Wynn is hurt, and we're supposed to go out and lose to save your ass? No. I never intended on throwing the competition. I understand how important this competition is to you. Chance, it's not about me. It's about the team. I can see how much damage I've caused here. I've done more harm than good. - Maybe I should just quit. - We don't need him. Never did. Listen, we changed the entire routine because of you. There's no way you can do this to us. Dane, tell him he doesn't have to leave. I got it. Rock Star, hold up. Now, emotions are clearly high right now. So I gotta let the brother do what he's gotta do, period. It's another day. And y'all are still family. That's what matters. - Theta what? - Theta Nu. There it is. Keep your head up, brother. All right, y'all. - DJ, be good, man. - Peace out. - Yo. - All right. Figured I'd find you here. I caught Wynn and Dane on their way to practice. They told me everything. I came to see if you were okay. I'm good. Well, why aren't you at practice? Because I just can't do the competition right now. What you mean is you don't want to do this right now. I really do care about you. And I'm not the only one. But that doesn't seem to mean anything to you. - Come on, Nikki. That's not even fair. - Not fair is turning your back... - ...on people that believed in you. - I don't wanna lose you, okay? - I don't wanna lose you. - Then don't. Come on, y'all, check up, check up, check up. Now, I know a lot has happened in the last couple days. We can't worry about that now. We worry about who's here. Don't worry about who's not. Who's on this roof, that's what's important. I'm gonna tell you right now, this competition still matters. Now, I'm hard on you guys because I want you to be the best. I need you guys to focus. I'm talking about razor-blade-precision focus, you understand? We Thetas. So let's get it. Roy, take us home. Yeah. Gonna make you proud, man. Make you proud. Let's go. Do it. I like what I'm seeing, dawgs. Top row, let that beast out, let's go. Yeah. I want it in the bag. We are the heart of the party, TNT. Smashing all you brothers with a beat. Okay. What up, Atlanta?

I know I was pretty hard on you last night, but we all make mistakes. Part of being a man is owning up to your mistakes. I didn't know how to be there for you. The only thing I knew how to do was work, and that's what I did. And I was wrong. I don't ever wanna push you away again. You have the right to choose your own path whether I like it or not. And I need you to know and feel comfortable to come to me... ...with whatever you need. You're all I have left. That's exactly why I came back. I belong here, and I ain't going anywhere. Not again. I still got so much to fix. I gotta pay these guys, make things up to Nikki. - I don't even know where to start. - You might start with that competition. Since when do you care about the competition? I don't care about the competition. I care about my son. Do you care enough to come watch me? Yeah. All right, y'all. Put your hands together. Make some noise for Truth University's own... ...Mu Gamma Xi. Yeah! - All right! - Mu Gamma Xi! M-U G-A-M-M-A X-I, step. Mu Gamma. Mu Gamma Xi. Mu Gamma. Mu Gamma Xi. M-U Gamma Xi. M-U Gamma Xi.

But you guys have a choice. You can go out there and give them exactly what they expect... ...for the Thetas to lose again... ...or you can look to the man next to you... ...and you can decide as a team... ...that you're gonna prove them wrong, show them what happens... ...when you give up, when you sleep on this fraternity... ...when you forget who we are, what this pledge stands for... ...what this brotherhood is all about. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Definitely. - Yeah. Each one of you has to decide that you want this so bad... ...that you're so hungry... ...that nothing's gonna stand in your way. If there's one thing I know about this team, it's that we fight. - Yes, sir. - Definitely. - We fight. - Yeah. - Damn right. - Yes, we do. - When the chips are down, we fight. - Yeah. When the deck is stacked against us, we fight. - Yeah. - Every step of the journey... ...till we don't got a ounce of fight left. That's right. If you can stand together, right here, right now, as a family... ...ain't nothing stopping us. If you can have enough courage to look past what's wrong... ...to see the value in what's right... ...win or lose, we win. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. Now, can we go out there and show them the strength... ...of the future legacy... ...that is Theta Nu Theta Fraternity Incorporated? - Can we do that? - Yes, sir! - Can we be victorious? - Yes, we can! - Theta what? - Theta Nu! - Theta what? - Theta Nu! - Theta what? - Theta Nu!

Me tearing up that restaurant didn't send a strong enough message. Now I'm gonna have to hurt somebody. Couldn't lose the competition for my team, man. Now, what I will do... ...is give you the money I owe with the winnings. Chance, do I look like a fool? - Let's go, man. Come on. - Yo, wait up. Hold up, hold up. Yo, dude, this here's college. We don't get down like that. He told me what happened. Take what he offers and keep moving. Seriously, grown folks talking. Why don't you mind your business? No, he is my business. If you think you're going anywhere with Chance... ...you're gonna have to hurt all of us. You're gonna meet me tomorrow with the 5 grand you owe me. But if I have to find you again... ...I don't care if Obama's on your pledge line. I'll handle that, partner. Do you hear me? Let's go. Good evening, gentlemen. - Y'all didn't have to do that. - Are you crazy? I told you yesterday, regardless of what happens, we're brothers. - We got your back. - Ain't going nowhere. - For life. - All right? Hey, what can I say, man? When I'm wrong, I say I'm wrong. I expect you to represent while you're here at Truth. Even if you are a Theta. - You know what I'm saying. - One big thing we're forgetting. We won! Who's the man? Who's the man? Who's the man? Thetas, Thetas. We're repping Thetas. Thetas: Thetas. Thetas, Thetas. We're repping! Improved By: anutta
