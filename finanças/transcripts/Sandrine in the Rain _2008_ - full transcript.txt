Hello? Hi, honey. How are you? I'm fine. The count? Yes, I tracked him down. In a derelict factory with some down-and-outs. I'll go talk to him tonight. It'll do mom a world of good to see him again. Of course I won't tell the doctors! I'll try and convince him to go back to the clinic. I think it's best for him too. You're crazy! I can't take mom with me. They'd never allow it. Just trust me, okay? What are you up to? Are you okay? You're always so secretive. Why don't you try to come here? Mom needs you too. And I really miss you. Okay... big kiss. Bye, honey. Take care. I'll call you soon. Goodbye. Out of the way! Move! - Go back! - Fire! Bastards! Turn round! - Cover me! - Go! Hi! - Already up? - Yes. - Aren't you on the afternoon shift? - I wanted to have breakfast with you. - How do you feel? - Fine. First day of a life of bliss. - Happy? - Yes. At least I won't be scared when the phone rings at night. You know... I hope you'll spend every night with me from now on. What are you doing later? Going back to my place. - I've got a ton of laundry to do. - Scrub-a-dub-dub... I'll take you to the movies tonight. - Can I come in? - Sure. - Want one? - No, I've given up smoking. - And just coffee on its own... - No cigarettes, no coffee. - You're at the end of your tether? - I'm surviving. Are you bothered about what they wrote in the papers? I'm fine, at the moment. Well... If you get off reasonably early, Rita's made lasagne. With all due respect to Rita's lasagne, I'm taking Giuliana to the movies tonight. I just talked to her. She said if you wanted to... I haven't taken her out in ages... Eight thirty. You know it wasn't your fault. Here we are. At last... Are you talking to me? Can I help you? You have to really be careful of kids these days. They don't joke around, they're well organized. Everyone talks about the Russian mafia, but... ...the problem are the Albanians. Leave Leonardo alone! Work's all you talk about! - Coffee? - Yes. Vincenzo's convinced everyone think like he does. He's shocked if people have different opinions. - Leonardo needs to relax. - Yes, maybe. - Sugar? - Two, thanks. You don't know how many Serpicos I've seen do an about-face... ...and end up in some department office in Rome. How come you're always so well informed? Been checking up on me? I know you want to run away. But it won't help you forget what happened. I only believe in the possibilities we create on a day to day basis. We build our futures in the here and now. What's going on? Nothing. Do you two think I'm stupid or what? I just asked for... - I got some info. - About what? About a transfer, but don't worry. Where are they sending you? Nowhere, I just looked into it. - Don't get worked up. - To Rome? Our hero... has put himself in line for one of those offers that can't be refused. Cut it out! What a drag! That's the last time I'll eat at your brother's. He'll never change. He feels guilty because he left me to fend for myself. We grew up in a hurry, you know what happened. But it never occurred to you that I might want a change too, did it? - Okay, you agree with him. - No, I didn't say that. But I understand why he acts like that. - Why didn't you tell me about Rome? - I wanted to. You know I can't stand it here. What about me? Let's take one step at a time. - You know I can't live without you. - No, you take me for granted. When were you going to tell me? "Great news, honey: they're sending me to Rome!" "We'll get used to it, we'll visit each other on alternate weekends." Like a couple of teenagers! - Will you open the door? - Go for a walk. And let me know if you feel like screwing this weekend. Where were you this afternoon? I was out! When I call you, you've got to answer right away. - Right away! - Cut it out, give me a break. I've had enough, I'm sick of you. I'm sick of you! It's none of your fucking business, I can do what I want. Slut! I'm a slut? Keep out of this! - Get your hands off me! - You're a bitch! Leave me alone, you shit! Hey, that's enough! Don't touch me! Cool it! It's okay, everything's fine. Everything's fine. Are you deaf? - Keep your fucking nose out. - I'm a police officer, be careful. Oh yeah? Is that okay for you? He's not a bad guy... It's just that sometimes we don't... we don't see eye to eye. - If you've got problems... - You can fix them for me. You can report him if you want. Fine. I'm cold. Yeah, I know, it's chilly. Take me back to your place. You've got somewhere, right? - Here we are. What's your name? - Sandrine. - Hello, Mr. Palombo. Your mail. - Thanks. - It's coming down hard, huh? - Yes. Well, here we are. It's a bit bare. I don't like clutter. - Hot in here, isn't it? - Yes. I'll put on some music. Fine. It's... Cuban music. How about a glass of white wine? So, there is something in this place... Yeah, something. Did you know that empty houses create spirals of compressed energy? And that we're surrounded by energy? There's even energy between us. We... create energy vibrations that join together and intertwine. Objects are important because they transform energy. So if you live in an empty house for a long time, the vibrations have nowhere to go. They come back to you. That's why you get sick or go a little crazy. Great! What's up? What's the matter? What's wrong? It's okay. Don't worry... Get out of the way! Hey, wait! Where are you going? You confuse me. And that's bad. That girl was 22 years old! Stop it! You didn't see her. I know, it was an accident. She just happened to be there. I just don't know what to think anymore. I can't sleep, can't eat. With Giuliana... I don't know. I just don't understand... - Are those papers ready? - Yes, sir. - I wanted to tell you... - Go ahead. I have to talk to him. Well? Sit down. I took care of everything. The robbery is a closed case. Listen... I need your total commitment to the job. I wouldn't know what to do with you behind some desk. I'm sorry about the other night. You know I love my sister as much as you do. And I'm really happy... that you two are an item. So mind your own fucking business and leave her in peace. Watch your language, I'm still your superior... I'm taking a vacation. - Good evening, Silvano. - Good evening, Mr. Palombo. - Do you have the spare keys? - Here they are. - I'll bring them right back. - Keep them. Goodnight. Who's Giuliana? Who is this? Have you forgotten about me? I asked who Giuliana is. My girlfriend. How did you get my number? Palombo: your surname's on the buzzer. I know the street number... and you're in the phonebook. Okay, where are you? What do you care? You think you can just do what you like? Call me, vanish... then reappear all of a sudden? I wanted to ask you something. Okay. Can we meet up? Actually... I don't think it's convenient for you just now. Don't worry about me. Tell me where you are. It's too late, you'd better let Giuliana in. - Who is it? - Me. You don't answer the buzzer, the phone's engaged, your cell phone's off. Come on, come up. What were you doing? I was in the bathroom and I had music on, sorry. Who was on the phone? It was... Luigi, he's coming to lunch tomorrow. What's up? I don't know. You don't know... what? What? He's a lucky guy to have a woman like you. You're beautiful, smart, a great cook... Thanks... So? When are you getting married? - What did I say? - Nothing, sorry. I got detergent in my eye. Well? That's the best I could do. - I don't usually eat lunch. - Thanks for saving my ass. - What about this girl you mentioned? - Shut up, Giuliana will hear... Yeah... but is she hot? She's weird. She's weird. She's young. How did you meet her? - Hello? - Hi. - Can we meet up tomorrow? - Where? The same bar as last time. - When? - The afternoon. 4 o'clock. - Who was it? - The office. Come on, tell me where you hid the cigarettes. I thought you'd stood me up. Sorry... - ...for being late. - It's okay. Well? Why did you call me? Who are you? What do you do? What do you want from me? Sometimes I feel like I'm slipping. And there's nothing I can do to stop myself. I spent the whole night thinking about you. Don't touch me. You've got a girlfriend. And you want to take another woman to bed. That's not true. You're falling in love with me. I needed to see you. I know. You don't know who brought us together. Right? Tell me. What is it? That was the first thing I wanted to do. - Hold it! - Listen, you bastard! I wanted to see who you were, how you lived. You really deserve the shitty life you've got! I said hold it. Listen to me, you little bitch. I don't know what the fuck you're on about. Are you mad? Why did you spit at me? Leave me alone or I'll scream. You like making men suffer? Is that your game? You want to play? All right. Leave me alone or you'll be sorry. You can take your medals and shove them up your ass, Mr. Palombo. Is something wrong? I met a girl. And? I met her in the park. Did you screw her? Hello? It's Luigi, sorry to bother you. - I've got some news. - I see. - Meet me at the bar. - Okay, see you later. - What is it? - I got a load on someone. - Her, right? - Come on Giuliana! I know you. I can sense things. Every time you lie to me, my heart beats faster. Want to talk about this all night? Okay, I think about her. Actually, I'm obsessed with her. But not for the reason you think. - So what is the reason? - Can't we just drop it? Try to explain. - You mean the world to me. - What do you want me to tell you? The truth. I just want to know the truth. Okay, nothing happened. It's a girl I'm investigating, I can't say anymore. Can we try to take it easy? Well? The car's registered to a certain Carolina Castellini. She's in a clinic out of town. But that's not all. Prepare yourself. Who is it? Leonardo. You know why I'm here, right? Well done. You finally worked it out. It's my job. This was her place. She was my sister. I want to know what she said to you. Her last words. Nothing. She didn't say anything. I stopped living that day. At least we've got something in common. What's up? What are you doing? No... - Wait, wait... - I know... We can't, we can't do it. Sorry to interrupt, but there are most suitable places for that. Get off, show me your papers. Ehy, Sandrine... So? What are you, deaf? - Is the lady feeling sick? - Didn't you recognize him? It's Palombo. Good morning, dr. Palombo. Hard day, uh? That's enough. Sorry doctor, but I must report that. Did you enjoy the show? Now leave us alone, get out. We didn't do anything wrong, okay? Do you have nothing else to do, for Christ's sake? Fuck off! Fuck off! Fuck! Did you see their faces? I'm telling you, they'll tell everything to their nice wives. You're not normal. Why? Do you like normality? They know me, those cops work with me. Do you get it? You don't get it, uh? Monsieur Palombo is angry. This is as far as I go. Over there, on the left. Stop here. Where are you going? Why are you going there? You ask too many questions. Learn to keep quiet. Just think that every time you see me will be the last. Because it could be. It really could be the last. If you follow me, you risk screwing everything up. Good evening! - You look gorgeous. - Really? Remember, he's still a cop. - It's personal. - You'd better sort it out. I will. - Does he live here? - Yes. He's one of the richest men in the area. - Well? - Hi. What's going on? What do you mean? You can explain while we're walking. Do you do these things out of guilt? We're men, you can talk frankly. The girl from Via Goito's sister is an old acquaintance of ours. Are you listening? Guess who came to dinner last night? I even had to stick up for you. But I asked myself: why? Why the hell am I bothering? I'm doing this for my sister. If it was up to me, it'd be a different story. Is that clear? Leave Giuliana out of this. Don't get her involved. - I spoke to the superintendent. - I know. Next time you go whoring, find a more secluded spot. Is she that beautiful? More beautiful than me? You want a life that I can't give you. Why, what's yours like? I don't know. I don't want to be mean... you don't deserve that. You just wanted to get laid. There was more to it than that. I don't know... there's something about her... A fear... a need... It doesn't have anything to do with love. There are some things I just can't understand. Lousy bastard! You took me for a ride! Traitor! You cheated on me! Okay, listen... It's nothing... Wake up. Coffee? What are you doing here? How did you get in? I stole your keys the first time I came here. Home would be the best place to kill you. I want you to meet someone. This is my mother. Everything okay? This is Leonardo. He loves me, mom. Leonardo killed Martine. Not on purpose, it was an accident. And now he loves me. I've forgiven him. You never talk to me. You never tell me what I ought to do. You're all I've got, mom. You should take care of me. My father's a secretary at the French embassy. They get transferred every 2 or 3 years. I haven't seen him for years. He's got another family now. My mom came back because she was born here. Then she got sick. Sometimes the body stops listening, like a pig-headed teenager. She fell in love with a man in the clinic. Weird... but nice. He thinks he's a count. He escaped a month ago but my mom didn't manage it. They got her as soon as she left the clinic. Martine found him, he's here in town. He's living with some down and outs. Can't you sleep? Looks like you can't either. I want a beautiful dress, all in white. I'd like to make my mom happy. Will you help me? Yes. Quick, come on! Let's go! There's so much stuff! - That's my beer! - Don't push! Come here! Mom! This is my mother, Carolina. I'm Sandrine. This is my boyfriend, Leonardo. - Are you the groom? - Yes. I'm an actress. People kept asking me when I was buying wine... beer... ...first in Peoria, then in Chicago, Denver, Frisco, New York... wherever I was, how come I ended up like this? And when all this started. I told everyone... with a silk dress... and the promise of marriage from a man... who was very rich. Bravo! Congratulations! For breakfast, I'd like croissants and Hungarian tea... ...and just a little sugar on the side, please. My respects to this magnificent gathering! Hey, it's the count! It's a small world, your Excellency. The world is grey, the world is blue, in my head there's always you. And I wonder how many other women! Good evening! What are you doing here, my little Sandrine? Look who I've brought to see you. You're beautiful! They've been in love for a long time. Well. Count! I want you to marry us. I wanted her to be here. - Me? - Yes. - Where's the groom? - Darling, come here... - Your Excellency... - The cigarette... I'll do it very simply. Love each other always, by the sea and in the mountains. Through all the seasons: autumn, winter, spring, summer. I now pronounce you man and wife. Kiss the bride. That's enough. Let's leave them. They can't stay here. No? No. We have to take them back. Mom... we're here, wake up. Miss Bonnet, you're very irresponsible! Can't you see I'm married? I'm Mrs. Palombo now. Your mother has to take medication at regular times. You put her in danger. Oh, you're back too! You know what? My mother's much better now. He loves her, okay? - You can't do as you please. - Okay. You're right. You're agreeing with this shit? I'll ignore that remark, because maybe you should be in here too. Your mother's condition is probably hereditary. Lousy bastard. You threaten people, kill them. I'll kill you! I'll report you! Stop it! You shit! Leave me alone, okay! Fuck off! We've been looking for you for over a month, Count. Come inside. We have to go. What's up? Why are you so quiet? Fuck off. What have I done wrong? I want to be alone. Get lost. Did you hear me? Get out of here, beat it! Go back to your shitty little life. Get someone else to pick up after you and wipe your ass! Scram! - Come down. - What the hell are you doing? - Come down. - What is it? We have to talk. Come down! Okay, for fuck's sake! - Come down! - Okay, take it easy. - Don't cause a scene here. - Well? - What? - You know what I'm talking about. - I don't think I do. - Giuliana! What about Giuliana? I'll ruin you. You won't mess up my sister's life again. Call her and say sorry. It's over with Giuliana. Sure, when it suits you. You're a mean, lousy... you took her for a ride. Well, I'll tell you this: it's over and it's over for you too. I swear on my kid's lives that I'll get you sent to the back of beyond to clean up shit! Hello? It's Sandrine. Listen to me, I want to get this straight. I don't want to see you again. Don't call me again. Was it your whore? Well done! Good. Well? How did it go? - It's all here. - Perfect. - This is the last time. - Are you nuts? Did that fucking cop make you go soft in the head? I can't believe you're in love with that dickhead! - Well, Sandrine? - Vincent... - Yes. - Don't go after him. - He loves me. - He loves you? Don't ever say that again! He loves you! And I don't, for fuck's sake? Who takes care of you? Him? I promised to help you kill him and I'll keep my promises. Always! - I've forgiven him. - You really piss me off! You've fallen in love with him. Are you going to live with him? Have kids? Is that what you'll do? Have kids? Is it? How long do you think we could keep this up? Forget what I make you do, dammit! I love you. I want what's best for you, so you're staying with me. Can't you see how close we are? Can't you see we're like one person? If you see that shit one more time, I'll kill him. You just see if I don't! You just see! Why have you stopped here? What do you want? It'll be summer soon. What's it like being unemployed? It's okay... How did you end up in this mess? Damn it! I bend over backwards to help you and you're still worried about her? You're thinking with her pussy, not with your brain. It's a good job she's vanished. And you know why? You know why? We found a dead man in a car with his brain splattered all over the place. We found out that he set up a sex and drugs ring to blackmail businessmen who have a thing for young girls. It's a big deal. Your little French girl's involved too. They found a video. Want to see it? Are you listening to me, dammit? - I don't know where she is! - What the hell's got into you? Forget her! They'll call you in, you could end up inside! They'll ask questions. Well? I don't know what to do, don't ask me. - Hello? - It's me. - Who's speaking? - It's me. I can't hear you... Sandrine? - Yes, Sandrine. - I can't hear you. - I don't have much time. - Wait! - Where are you? I'll come over. - I'm at the Hotel Quattro Venti. Wait! Shit! Good morning. I'm Mr. Palombo. I'm looking for Miss Bonnot. I'm sorry, Miss Bonnot checked out. What do you mean? She left a message for you. Obviously I haven't read it. - She gave it to you? - Yes. "I love you, but I can't drag you into this situation." "Goodbye." I don't get it, she says she loves me and then she dumps me. In this lousy hotel. What are these guys looking at? I heard her make a call from over there. If I remember rightly, she said... It means, see you tomorrow night. Yeah. Is that all? - How do you know where she went? - She asked me to call this number. A woman answered and she said... Sainte Marie-la-Mer. - And she gave you this. - Yes. Hello? I'd like to speak to Sandrine, please. - Who's speaking? - A friend. She's not here, she left last night. What? She left? Yes, she went to see her father in Paris. - When will she be back? - This afternoon. - I don't know which bus. - You don't know which what? I don't know which bus she'll be on. Who are you? Thanks, I'll go to the bus terminal. She'll be back sooner or later. Excuse me, I'd like to know... what time the bus gets in from Paris. Just a second. Here's the timetable. Thanks. - Are there anymore? - Yes, sir. - Do you know where they stop? - Yes, Chemins des Macrus square. - Thanks. - Don't mention it. Bye. Excuse me, are these the only passengers? Yes, if no one threw themselves out of the window. - Are there more buses from Paris? - Sure, it's a regular service. - Do they all stop here? - Yes, every two hours. Thanks. Excuse me, I'm waiting for a passenger from Paris... If they aren't here now, they're not coming. Hello, it's me again. - She isn't back, is she? - No. She called to say she wouldn't be back. She wouldn't be back... Hello? I'm pregnant. I went to Paris because I wanted to see my father. But then I realised that I never want to see him again. I want to erase him from my life. He's a stranger to me. He can't help me. I really took you for a ride! I've taken everyone in my life for a ride! I want to be with you. - You're not the father. - It doesn't matter. Everything comes to an end. And you eventually get bored with what doesn't. Love only lasts forever in books. And the characters are made up. They don't have souls. I want this baby. It'll need a father to love it too. You think you could be the one? I'd like to know where you are and what you're doing. I'd like to know what you're like, if I already met you. Or if we just brushed against each other some time. I'd like to know if we'll meet and when. If it'll be too late or just in time. We'll meet without realizing how much we mattered to each other. I'll recognise you right away. I'll just need to look in your eyes to realize it's you. But right now... where are you? And are you there? Subtitles: Laser S. Film s.r.l. - Rome
