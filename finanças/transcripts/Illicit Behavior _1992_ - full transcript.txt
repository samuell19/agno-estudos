I MANAGED TO GET US AN APPOINTMENT WITH DR. HALPERIN. HE CAN SEE US AT 10:00. MELISSA, YOU KNOW I DON'T LIKE SHRINKS. LEAVE ME ALONE. MIKE, HE'S HELPED ME A LOT, AND I WISH YOU WOULD COME WITH ME TO SEE HIM. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. I'M UP. OK. GET UP. IT'S A QUARTER TO 9:00. WE GOT TO GO. I'M UP! WHAT TIME IS IT? QUARTER TO 9:00. [MUMBLING] OH, WALKER. IMPECCABLE TIMING. THIS IS MARTIN ERLICH OF THE A.C.L.U. HE WANTS TO HAVE A WORD WITH YOU. I'LL HAVE TO CHECK MY CALENDAR. HOW ABOUT RIGHT NOW, DETECTIVE? I DON'T HAVE THE TIME. UH, CAPTAIN, CAN I SPEAK TO YOU A SECOND? CAPTAIN BROOKS, THIS IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF INSOLENCE AND LACK OF RESPECT FOR THE A.C.L.U. THAT CASTS A BLACK CLOUD OVER THIS DEPARTMENT. IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'VE GOT A PARTNER FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE OVER AT COUNTY. SO, EXCUSE ME VERY MUCH IF I DON'T HAVE THE INCLINATION TO DISCUSS THE SIXTH AMENDMENT WITH YOU. LET ME CHECK ON MY OFFICER AT THE HOSPITAL, I PROMISE HE'LL CALL YOU, MARTIN. I KNOW YOU'RE HURTING ABOUT GIBBY, BUT CUTTING NEW ASSHOLES WITH THE A.C.L.U. GUYS IS NOT EXACTLY IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE DEPARTMENT NOWADAYS. I'M SORRY, CAPTAIN. YOU KNOW, THE LAST THING I NEEDED THIS MORNING WAS SOME WEASEL IN MY FACE, LECTURING ME ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF PSYCHO KILLERS. MAYBE HE'S HAVING A FIELD DAY WITH THIS MADDOX FIASCO. EVERY OTHER DAY, SOME PERP IS ON THE TUBE, MAKING A CASE FOR POLICE BRUTALITY. ALL I KNOW IS GIBBY'S ON LIFE SUPPORT. HIS WIFE IS WORRIED ABOUT HER NEXT DIME. WHAT'S THIS? GIBBY'S DISABILITY PAPERS. I'D APPRECIATE YOUR PROCESSING THEM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. HIS NAME IS YARNELL. HE'S WITH VICE. MIKE YARNELL? YOU KNOW HIM? WE PARTNERED OUT OF THE ACADEMY. GOOD COP. HE WAS INVOLVED IN A SHOOTING THE OTHER NIGHT. REVIEW BOARD BUMPED HIM OVER TO US. REPORT SAYS HERE THAT THE SUSPECT HAD A STRAIGHT RAZOR. YEAH. FAMILY MAN. FATHER OF 6. NO PRIORS. HIS WIFE GOT YOUR FRIEND THE A.C.L.U. INVOLVED. THIS LOOKS OPEN AND SHUT TO ME. WELL, WALK IT THROUGH, JUST THE SAME, AND CLOSE IT BY THE BOOK. TAKE CARE OF THOSE FOR ME? I WILL. THANKS. WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME ALL THE QUESTIONS? DID YOU FORGET THAT SHE'S THE ONE WITH THE PROBLEM? HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT IT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH OUR FINDING A SOLUTION. AH. HEH. WELL, HOW DO YOU THINK I FEEL ABOUT IT? I MEAN--I MEAN, HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT IT? MIKE, NOBODY'S BLAMING YOU. NOT MELISSA, NOT ME. THEN, WHY AM I CATCHING ALL THE FLAK? I MEAN, YOU REALLY WANT MY OPINION? HUH? I THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH HER FATHER. HE PASSED AWAY 2 WEEKS AGO, AND EVER SINCE THEN, IT'S LIKE COMING HOME TO SYBIL. AND I DON'T KNOW WHO THE HELL'S GOING TO BE THERE. MELISSA, AT OUR LAST SESSION, YOU BEGAN TO TELL ME ABOUT THE DEATH OF YOUR FATHER. THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MY FATHER. WELL, THEN WHAT? MIKE, PLEASE. THEN WHAT? MELISSA, GO AHEAD. STATE IT AT YOUR OWN PACE. IT HAS TO DO WITH MY BROTHER. WE HAD PROBLEMS SINCE WE WERE KIDS. AFTER MY FATHER GOT SICK, MY BROTHER FARRELL... HE CAME BACK TO... TO TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS, AND TO TAKE CARE OF MY DAD. MY FATHER OWNED A NIGHT CLUB BAR. ANYWAY... [SIGHS] FARRELL CAME BACK. AND I HAD GOTTEN HIM OUT OF MY MIND, THROUGH ALL THESE YEARS. AND NOW HE'S BACK. HE'S BACK HERE IN THE SAME CITY. AND EVERY TIME THE PHONE RINGS, OR THERE'S A KNOCK AT THE DOOR... I LOSE IT. I JUST WANT HIM OUT OF MY LIFE. WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER TELL ME ABOUT THIS, MELISSA? WELL, WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR BROTHER? NOTHING. CHRIST. IT'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND, MIKE? NO. I JUST WANT TO FORGET IT. FORGET WHAT? WHAT'S THE SOURCE OF YOUR PROBLEM WITH YOUR BROTHER? I CAN'T TELL YOU. PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME TELL YOU. MELISSA... YOU CALLED ME. NOW, WHY DID YOU MAKE THE CALL, UNLESS YOU WANTED TO TELL SOMEONE? BECAUSE HE MADE ME DO IT. DO WHAT? HE-- HE WOULD SNEAK INTO MY ROOM ALMOST EVERY NIGHT. I WOULDN'T LOOK AT HIM. I COULDN'T. HIS HANDS... HIS HANDS WERE ALWAYS SWEATY. HOT. AND HE HAD THIS SMELL. THEN HE MADE ME DO THESE THINGS. THESE HORRIBLE... DIRTY...THINGS. MELISSA, HOW COME YOU NEVER TOLD ME ABOUT THIS? HOW COME? HOW COME? MIKE, WHAT COULD YOU HAVE DONE? WHAT COULD YOU HAVE DONE? BILL TANNER? MATT WALKER. PLEASE SIT DOWN. HOW'S YOUR HAND? I GOT 88 STITCHES HOLDING IT TOGETHER. OTHER THAN THAT, IT'S FINE. SO, WHY IS I.A.D. SO INTERESTED IN WHAT HAPPENED THE OTHER NIGHT? IT'S ROUTINE. JUST PROCEDURE. NOBODY'S INTERESTED IN HURTING A GOOD COP DOING HIS JOB. THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW. TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED TUESDAY NIGHT. IT'S ALL THERE IN THE REPORT. DIDN'T YOU READ IT? LOOK, BILL... YOU KNOW THE DEPARTMENT IS UNDER THE MICROSCOPE LATELY ABOUT THIS EXCESSIVE FORCE. WE GOT TO GO BY THE BOOK, SO I'D APPRECIATE THE HELP. GO AHEAD. IT'S VERY SIMPLE. I WENT TO CUFF THE SON OF A BITCH. HE COMES AFTER ME WITH A RAZOR. YARNELL SHOOTS HIM. THAT'S IT. HOW LONG HAVE YOU AND YARNELL BEEN PARTNERS? JEEZ, I DON'T KNOW. WHAT? 5 YEARS? HE HAS THREE 181s IN THE PAST 18 MONTHS, AND YOU BACKED HIM UP EVERY TIME. WHAT ARE YOU IMPLYING? THAT I LIED ON THE REPORT? DOES THIS LOOK LIKE I'M LYING? I'M NOT IMPLYING ANYTHING. I'M INTERESTED IN THE MENTAL CONDITION OF YOUR PARTNER. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THE MENTAL CONDITION OF MY PARTNER. HE HAS A HISTORY OF USING EXCESSIVE FORCE. EXCESSIVE FORCE. YOU KNOW, THEY JUMP ON US FOR THE SLIGHTEST AMOUNT OF BULLSHIT. WE'RE OUT THERE EVERY NIGHT, DEALING WITH THESE FUCKING ANIMALS. WHEN A COP TRIES TO PROTECT HIMSELF, NOBODY WANTS TO HEAR ABOUT IT. WHO DO WE GO TO WHEN WE HAVE A PROBLEM? WHEN YOU'RE BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE... A COP ONLY HAS HIS PARTNER TO DEPEND ON. THAT'S RIGHT. YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D LIKE TO ADD? I THINK I SAID EVERYTHING. THANKS. THANK YOU. DON'T. WHAT EXACTLY DID THAT SON OF A BITCH DO TO YOU, ANYWAY? WHY DO YOU WANT TO KNOW? BECAUSE IT'S TEARING US APART, THAT'S WHY. I'M SORRY I EVER BROUGHT IT UP. HOW COME YOU NEVER TALKED TO ME ABOUT IT? WHAT COULD YOU CHANGE NOW, MIKE? WHAT COULD YOU DO ABOUT IT? MRS. YARNELL? YES. MATT WALKER. I.A.D. I'D LIKE TO SPEAK WITH YOUR HUSBAND. IS HE EXPECTING YOU? NOT EXACTLY. WELL, HE'S STILL SLEEPING. IT'S IMPORTANT, MA'AM. I DON'T REALLY FEEL COMFORTABLE ABOUT WAKING HIM UP RIGHT NOW. HE'S REALLY TIRED. YEAH. SOMETHING I CAN HELP YOU WITH? HOW YOU DOING, MIKE? OH, SHIT. DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE THE SAME WALKER WITH I.A.D. BEEN A LONG TIME. YEAH. HONEY, MATT AND ME-- WE USED TO WORK TOGETHER WHEN WE WERE HOT SHOTS OUT OF THE ACADEMY. REALLY? YEAH. HE'S COME A LONG WAY. MADE HIS STRIPES CRAWLING UP OTHER COPS' ASSES. AIN'T THAT RIGHT, MATT? I DIDN'T DRIVE ALL THE WAY OUT HERE TO GIVE YOU GRIEF, SO LIGHTEN UP, ALL RIGHT? I TAKE A FEW DAYS OFF SICK, I.A.D. SHOWS UP ON MY FUCKING DOORSTEP? HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO FEEL? NOBODY AT I.A.D. WANTS TO HURT YOU. I JUST WANT TO SPEND A FEW MINUTES WITH YOU, ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS. EVERYTHING I HAD TO SAY WAS IN MY REPORT. TANNER'LL BACK ME UP 100%. YOU'RE RIGHT. TANNER BACKS YOU UP. BUT WE NEED TO HEAR YOUR VERSION OF WHAT HAPPENED. CLOSE THIS OUT. YOU WANT TO TALK TO ME? YOU DO IT TO ME WHEN I'M ON THE CLOCK, NOT IN MY HOME. YOU'RE AGGRAVATING A SIMPLE PROCEDURAL MATTER, MIKE. MIKE, I THINK YOU SHOULD TALK TO HIM. GET IN THE HOUSE. HONEY, HE'S RIGHT. JUST GET IN THE HOUSE! OK. ONLY TRYING TO HELP. YEAH, RIGHT. WE KNOW THIS GUY YARNELL? P.A.: DR. DAVIS, TELEPHONE. WELL, HE'S, UH... HE WORKS HOLLYWOOD VICE. AND WE CAUGHT HIS PACKAGE THE DAY AFTER YOU WENT DOWN. HE AND HIS PARTNER, THEY WERE INVOLVED IN A... SHOOTING OF A RAPE PERP. HE HAD A RAZOR. POOR FUCKING PERP. PERP'S WIFE GOT THE A.C.L.U. INVOLVED. CLAIMS EXCESSIVE FORCE. YOU KNOW. THAT BULLSHIT. ANYWAY, THE ISSUING TEAM KICKED THE BALL DOWN TO US. I CHECK IT OUT. YARNELL'S GOT 3 PRIOR 181s. HE'S NOT COOPERATING. WHAT ABOUT THE PARTNER? HE TOOK 88 STITCHES FROM THE RAZOR. WHEW. SOUNDS PRETTY OPEN AND SHUT TO ME. THIS GUY YARNELL MAYBE HAVE A HARD-ON FOR YOU FOR SOME REASON? NO. BUT HE'S GOT A HARD-ON FOR ANYONE CONNECTED WITH I.A.D. YOU KNOW HOW THAT IS. HE'S A GOOD COP, GIB. HE'S HURTING. AND THAT'S A CRASH AND BURN IN THE MAKING, UNLESS HE GETS SOME HELP. WHY DON'T YOU RECOMMEND IT? HEY... IF COPS DON'T HELP COPS, WHO THE HELL ELSE WILL? YOU TOOK THE WORDS RIGHT OUT OF MY MOUTH, GIBBY. JUST TAKE IT EASY, WILL YOU? THIS GUY'S RUINING MY LIFE. YOU WANT ME TO TAKE IT EASY? COME BACK AT 7:00. WE'RE CLOSED. WE'RE LOOKING FOR FARRELL. I'M FARRELL. WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU? CLASSY LITTLE PLACE. ALL EXCEPT FOR THE PIECE OF SHIT WHO OWNS IT. WHY DON'T YOU GUYS TAKE OFF AND LET ME GET BACK TO WORK? YOU KNOW, IT MAKES ME SICK JUST BEING IN HERE WITH YOU? GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE. I'M CALLING THE COPS. WE ARE THE COPS. YOU'RE MELISSA'S HUSBAND. THAT'S RIGHT. SHE TOLD ME ALL ABOUT YOU, TOO. OH, YEAH? WELL, GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE. HEY. NOW, YOU KEEP THAT HORSE COCK OUT OF MY FACE. I SAID GET OUT OF HERE! DON'T! DON'T. DON'T PROVOKE ME. COME HERE! COME HERE! YOU'RE GOING TO CLOSE DOWN, AND STAY THE FUCK OUT OF MY LIFE! YOU HEAR ME? I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT. YOU LISTENING TO ME? LET ME SHOW YOU, YOU SON OF A BITCH! YOU REALIZE WHAT YOU DID TO ME? DO YOU HEAR ME? I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE HE DOESN'T-- I KNOW. I'M ASKING. THAT'S ALL. YOU GODDAMNED NASTY CREEP! I'M ALL RIGHT! WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU? I'M ALL RIGHT! YOU SON OF A BITCH! I WANT YOU OUT OF HERE! DROP THAT GUN! WHAT? ARE YOU GOING TO SHOOT ME? WHATEVER MELISSA TOLD YOU, SHE'S LYING. DROP IT! YOU AIN'T GOT THE BALLS TO SHOOT A COP. DON'T MAKE ME DO THIS. DROP THAT FUCKING GUN! LOOK AT YOU. YOU'RE SHAKING ALL OVER. YOU CAN'T COME IN HERE AND HASSLE ME. AND THEY'LL TAKE AWAY YOUR BADGE. MY BADGE? YOU MOTHER-- [GUNSHOT] [GROANING] OH, SHIT. SHIT. [RASPING] BILL... OH, SHIT. BILL... BILL, HE SHOT HIMSELF. HE SHOT HIMSELF! YOU HEAR ME? HE SHOT HIMSELF! CAPTAIN... I RECOMMEND THAT WE PUT YARNELL THROUGH A SERIES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING. A GOOD COP. HE DESERVES HELP. YOU'RE GOING TO NEED A LOT OF HELP. HE JUST KILLED A GUY. AND CATCH THIS. THE VICTIM WAS HIS WIFE'S BROTHER. [CRYING] GOD. [MOANS] JUST GET HOME? MELISSA, I HAVE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. MMM. WHAT TIME DID YOU GET OFF WORK? THAT TURD FARRELL-- HE'S DEAD. IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. I JUST WENT THERE TO TALK TO HIM. HE PULLED OUT A GUN, AND WHEN I WENT TO TAKE IT AWAY... HE'S DEAD? I SWEAR TO GOD IT WAS AN ACCIDENT, MELISSA. I JUST WENT THERE TO SCARE HIM, SO HE'D STOP HASSLING YOU. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. BELIEVE ME, MELISSA, PLEASE. NO. PLEASE DON'T HATE ME. NO. [SOBBING] YOU'RE ALL I GOT LEFT IN THIS WORLD. I NEED YOU. TOUCH ME. BE WITH ME. BE WITH ME. YOU HATE ME. THIS IS BULLSHIT, CAPTAIN. YOU TAKE AWAY MY BADGE, YOU MAKE ME LOOK GUILTY. UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE, YOUR HOME WILL BE YOUR REGULAR DUTY ASSIGNMENT, DURING YOUR REGULARLY SCHEDULED WATCHES. EACH DAY, YOU WILL STAY IN CONTACT WITH YOUR WATCH COMMANDER, AND INFORM HIM OF ANY CHANGE IN LOCATION, DUE TO OFFICIAL BUSINESS. HEH. LIKE THE SHRINK? YEAH. STANDARD DEPARTMENTAL PROCEDURE. YEAH, WELL, THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY RIGHT BEFORE THEY NAIL YOUR ASS TO THE WALL, CAPTAIN. WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON? WHAT'S HE DOING AT MY DESK? HEY! NO. I'M ALL RIGHT. I'M ALL RIGHT.

AND WE COMMIT HIS BODY TO THE GROUND. EARTH TO EARTH. ASHES TO ASHES. DUST TO DUST. THE LORD BLESS HIM AND KEEP HIM. THE LORD MAKE HIS FACE TO SHINE UPON HIM, AND BE GRACIOUS UNTO HIM. THE LORD LIFT UP HIS COUNTENANCE UPON HIM, AND GIVE HIM PEACE. AMEN. All: AMEN. THE LORD BE WITH YOU. WITH THY SPIRIT, LET US PRAY. Woman: BEAUTIFUL SERVICE, FATHER. Man: THANK YOU, FATHER. THAT WAS VERY NICE. YOU GOT SOME NERVE SHOWING UP HERE TO HARASS ME. Mike: YOU JUST REMEMBER WHAT I SAID, WALKER, HUH? [IMITATES GUNSHOT] I WAS JUST SAYING HELLO. [ENGINE STARTS] Gibson: ALL RIGHT.

WELL, DOC, CAN YOU TELL ME HOW MAYBE HER BROTHER FITS INTO THE SCENARIO. AGAIN, I'M SORRY. THAT WOULD BE A VIOLATION OF DOCTOR/PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY. YOU KNOW, DOC, UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW, THERE ARE LIMITS TO DOCTOR/PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY. I'M WELL AWARE OF THE LAW, LIEUTENANT, AND BELIEVE ME, IF AN OVERT THREAT HAD BEEN MADE IN MY PRESENCE, I WOULD'VE FOLLOWED THE LAW. [SIGHS] YOU KNOW, GIB... SOMETIMES I FEEL... LIFE IS LIKE... WINNING THE LOTTERY WHERE... THE JACKPOT IS A ONE-WAY TICKET DOWN THE HERSHEY TRAIL. I KNOW YOU, WALKER. YOU'RE THE KIND OF COP WHO PULLS LONG HOURS SO HE DON'T HAVE TO GO HOME AT NIGHT. WHEN YOU DO GO HOME, THERE'S NOTHING THERE EXCEPT CHICKEN POT PIES AND LATE-NIGHT MOVIES. YOU SLEEP WITH THE LIGHTS ON, YOU CAN'T WAIT TILL MORNING ROLLS AROUND. THAT WAY YOU DON'T HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF, IS THIS WHAT IT ALL COMES DOWN TO? WHERE'D I MISS OUT? WHERE'D I MAKE A WRONG TURN? WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME? I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU WHAT ANY COP WOULD TELL YOU. YOU GET INVOLVED IN A DOMESTIC SITUATION, YOU END UP WITH YOUR BALLS ROLLED UP REAL TIGHT. [RAIN FALLING] [DOOR CLOSES] [DOOR CLOSES] OHH. DAMN IT.

YOU KNOW WHAT'S INSIDE YOUR HEART. WHY CAN'T I HAVE A SIMPLE LIFE? YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR SOMEBODY ELSE'S SINS. I KNOW, BUT I FEEL GUILTY. I FEEL GUILTY BECAUSE I CAN'T GET YOU OUT OF MY MIND. I CAN'T. [SIGHS] IS THAT WRONG? [DOORBELL RINGS] [DOORBELL RINGS] YEAH? UH, IS MELISSA HERE? YEAH, SURE, COME ON IN. UH, WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO AHEAD AND WAIT IN THE LIVING ROOM? I'LL TELL HER YOU'RE HERE. SURE. MELISSA? MELISSA? I WAS WRONG. SHE'S NOT HERE. I'M SORRY. WELL, WILL TELL HER THAT CHARLENE LERNOUX IS TRYING TO GET IN TOUCH WITH HER? LERNOUX? I'M MELISSA'S EX-SISTER-IN-LAW. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, SISTER-IN-LAW? I WAS MARRIED TO FARRELL. 5 YEARS I'VE BEEN MARRIED TO MELISSA... AND NEVER ONCE DID SHE MENTION TO ME SHE HAD A SISTER-IN-LAW. I CAN BELIEVE THAT. WHEN I WAS MARRIED TO FARRELL, SHE JUST IGNORED ME. I THINK IT WAS HER WAY OF GETTING BACK AT HIM. HEH. AFTER WHAT THAT PERVERT DID TO HER, CAN YOU BLAME HER? WHAT DID HE DO TO HER? WELL, IT SEEMS THAT WHEN THEY WERE GROWING UP, UH, HE USED TO MOLEST HER. [CHUCKLES] WHAT, THIS IS FUNNY? OH, THAT'S THE BEST ONE YET. WHAT, YOU THINK I'M KIDDING? MELISSA WAS ALWAYS TELLING LIES ON FARRELL. AND SHE WAS ALWAYS GETTING CAUGHT IN THEM, TOO. I DON'T BELIEVE THIS. MELISSA HATED FARRELL. SO WHAT? SHE HATED HIM. BIG DEAL! I'M NOT HERE TO CAUSE ANY TROUBLE. GOOD. ALL I WANT IS MY SHARE OF THE MONEY. MONEY? WHAT MONEY? DIDN'T MELISSA TELL YOU? SHE OWNS THE BAR NOW. THAT WAS HER BROTHER'S BAR. THAT'S NOT MELISSA'S. BUT FARRELL'S DYING DROPPED IT RIGHT IN HER LAP. LOOK IT--WHEN THEIR DADDY DIED, HE LEFT THE BUSINESS TO FARRELL, BUT HE LEFT THE LAND THAT IT WAS ON TO MELISSA. AS LONG AS FARRELL KEPT THAT BAR OPEN, MELISSA COULDN'T SELL OFF A SPOONFUL OF THE DIRT. UH, HOW MUCH IS THIS LAND WORTH? AROUND $2 MILLION. I'M FINDING THIS KIND OF HARD TO BELIEVE. I'VE GOT A COPY OF THE WILL WITH ME. RIGHT HERE ON PAPER. EVERYTHING REVERTS DIRECTLY TO MELISSA. YOU'RE BOTH MILLIONAIRES. [SIGHS] WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE? ALL I WANT IS THAT MY KIDS DON'T GO WITHOUT. WHAT WAS RIGHTFULLY THEIR FATHER'S OUGHT TO GO TO THEM. TWICE BEFORE, I'VE TRIED TO BROACH THE SUBJECT WITH MELISSA, BUT SHE KEEPS RUNNING OFF SOMEWHERE TO MEET WITH THAT COP. WHAT COP? [WHISPERING] Hi. HI. I BROUGHT YOU SOME COFFEE. REALLY? MILK, ONE SUGAR. THAT'S ALL? I NEED MORE SUGAR. A LOT MORE. [TIRES SCREECH] WALKER! OPEN THIS FUCKING DOOR! MELISSA, I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE! MELISSA! YOU BITCH! YOU SET ME UP! YOU SET ME UP! COME ON! [GUNSHOT] [GRUNTS SOFTLY] YOU... DAMN SON OF A BITCH. [EXHALES] WHO AM I SPEAKING TO, PLEASE? SAL, THIS IS LIEUTENANT WALKER. CAN I SPEAK TO CAPTAIN BROOKS? THANKS. HELLO, CAPTAIN. UH... NO, SIR. THERE'S, UH-- I NEED AN O.S.I. TEAM AND A CORONER AT MY HOUSE. THERE'S BEEN AN INCIDENT. [SIGHS] NO, SIR, I'M OK. [SIGHS] WELL, UH... YARNELL MADE GOOD ON HIS THREAT, SIR. YES. THANK YOU. MELISSA... HEY. HE WAS GONNA KILL US. MELISSA... WE HAVE TO GET DRESSED. UNDERSTAND? HE WAS GONNA KILL YOU. [PANTING] COME ON. ALL RIGHT, SWEETHEART. COME ON. LOOK... WE CAN TAKE CARE OF THIS 2 WAYS. EITHER HE IS GONNA PUT YOU THROUGH THE RINGER OR I CAN... I CAN FUDGE YOU THROUGH. HOW? YARNELL THREATENED ME THE OTHER DAY AT THE PRECINCT IN FRONT OF A FEW MEN. I COULD SAY IT WAS SELF DEFENSE. MATT, I'M SCARED. ALL RIGHT, LOOK... WE HAVE TO HURRY, OK? 'CAUSE THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY. WE'VE GOT TO HURRY. YOU'VE GOT TO GET DRESSED AND GO HOME. WHEN THE POLICE COME TO TELL YOU, YOU'VE GOT TO BREAK DOWN. YOU WERE NEVER HERE. GO. [TIRES SCREECHING] [MEN TALKING QUIETLY] Man: I DON'T KNOW. THE TELEVISION WAS ON. [CAR DOOR OPENS] [CAR DOOR CLOSES] [KNOCK ON DOOR] MATTHEW. HI. I'M SORRY FOR STOPPING BY. I... TRIED CALLING. THE MACHINE WAS ON. YOU OK? TANNER WAS HERE. HE'S NOT HANDLING IT TOO WELL. OH. CAN I COME IN? I DON'T THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA RIGHT NOW. JUST FOR 5 MINUTES. NO, MATT, I'M SUPPOSED TO BE AT THE UNDERTAKER'S. WELL, I WANT TO EXPLAIN WHAT WENT DOWN IN THE INVESTIGATION. LOOK, I DON'T HAVE THE TIME RIGHT NOW. I THOUGHT IF ANYONE COULD UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH, IT WOULD BE YOU. BUT I CAN SEE YOU'RE JUST TOO CONCERNED WITH YOURSELF. THAT'S NOT TRUE. THIS WHOLE THING IS TO PROTECT YOU. I'M SORRY, MATT. I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA THAT WE SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN. HEH. I PUT MY WHOLE CAREER ON THE LINE FOR YOU. I WAS VULNERABLE. I CAME TO YOU FOR HELP. I DIDN'T WANT MIKE DEAD. WELL, NEITHER DID I. YOU KNOW? I MEAN, YOU WERE THE ONE WHO SHOT HIM, REMEMBER? IT WAS YOUR HOUSE... YOUR GUN. YOU LIED ABOUT YOUR INVOLVEMENT WITH THE VICTIM'S WIFE. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO EXPLAIN THAT? HUH? [SIGHS] WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? I'M SAYING THAT IT'S OVER BETWEEN US, MATT. IT'S OVER. OH, MELISSA-- GOOD-BYE, MATT. MELISSA-- WHO WAS IT? MY COMPETITION? DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH. WHAT DID HE WANT? GUESS. HEH. HE'S NOT GONNA BE A PROBLEM, IS HE? I DON'T THINK SO. YOU SHOULD BE GLAD I CAN'T GET UP AND KICK YOUR ASS TO SUNDAY. LOOK AT YOU. YOU'RE A GODDAMN HIGH SCHOOL KID WITH AN ACHING HEART. IT'S NOT THAT, GIB. I FUCKED UP, MAN. EACH TIME THE O.S.I. WALKED ME THROUGH THE GODDAMN SCENE, I WAS CHOKING ON THE FUCKING LIES I HAD TO FEED THEM. SORRY. YARNELL'S VOICE... KEEPS NAGGING AT ME. SHE'S DOING IT AGAIN. I FEEL IT IN MY GUT. OH, BULLSHIT. YOU'RE FEELING SO GUILTY ABOUT POKING THIS GUY'S WIFE YOU'RE BEGINNING TO SEE CONSPIRACIES IN YOUR CEREAL. YOU'RE LETTING YOUR ACHING HEART AND YOUR COCK-EYED DINGUS LEAD YOU AROUND. JUST LOSE THIS THING. I WISH I COULD. I KEEP...THINKING... YARNELL WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY IF I DIDN'T-- BUT YOU DID. YOU GOT INVOLVED IN A DOMESTIC SITUATION THAT COULD ONLY END IN DISASTER. DUST IT OFF AND GO BACK TO WORK. WELL... PAPPY KNOWS BEST. WALKER. WALKER! YOU ALL RIGHT? YEAH. THE O.S.I. REPORT CAME DOWN. IT'S OK. AFTER I GAVE MY STATEMENT, IT WAS A LOCK. YOU KNEW THAT.

I THINK SHE IS GOING TO TRY TO KILL ME. WHERE'D YOU GET THIS? WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT WAS A BIRTHDAY PRESENT? DO YOU REALLY EXPECT ME TO USE THIS? IF WE MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A BREAK-IN, WHO WILL KNOW THE DIFFERENCE? COME ON. IF WE MOVE NOW, WE'LL STILL HAVE TIME. WE'LL BEAT THEM TO THE PUNCH. AND I KNOW JUST THE MAN WHO SHOULD HAVE A PIECE OF THE ACTION. WHO? BILL TANNER. HE WAS YARNELL'S PARTNER. I WANT HIM TO KNOW THE TRUTH. Man, on machine: THIS IS BILL TANNER. LEAVE YOUR MESSAGE. [BEEP] Matt: BILL... UH, THIS IS MATT WALKER. I HAVE SOME IMPORTANT INFORMATION. PLEASE MEET ME AT FARRELL'S CLUB. YOU HAVE THE CROWBAR? RIGHT HERE. WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED, DON'T PANIC.

ARE YOU OK? YEAH. [DOOR OPENS] WE GOTTA CALL AN O.S.I TEAM. MOVE AWAY FROM THERE AND DROP THE GUN. WHAT, ARE YOU DEAF? MOVE AWAY FROM THERE AND DROP THE GUN! YOU DROP IT. Bill: DON'T YOU MOVE! I THOUGHT YOU AND YARNELL WERE FRIENDS. LIFE GETS COMPLICATED. YEAH... 2 MILLION PLUS. NO WONDER. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? TELL HIM. IT SAYS SO IN THE WILL. SHOOT HIM. SHUT UP. WITH THEM OUT OF THE PICTURE, WE CAN HAVE IT JUST THE WAY WE WANT IT. I SAID SHUT UP! TELL HIM WHO YOUR BOYFRIEND IS, MELISSA. [CHUCKLES] NOBODY. I ALREADY TOLD YOU THAT. YOU'RE A LIAR. I USED HIM. I HAD TO USE HIM TO GET HER OUT OF THE WAY. YEAH. THAT'S RIGHT. SHE USED HIM. SHE USED ALL OF US. TELL HIM, MELISSA. [CHUCKLING] HE'S LYING. TELL HIM. TELL HIM! Matt: LOOKING BACK ON IT ALL, I GUESS THINGS ENDED UP THE WAY THEY WERE MEANT TO. CHARLENE SOLD THE BAR. AT LEAST HER KIDS ARE TAKEN CARE OF NOW. GIBBY WENT AHEAD WITH HIS RETIREMENT. HE'S DOING FINE. MY DAUGHTER FINALLY CAME TO VISIT. WE HAD A GREAT TIME. OTHER THAN THAT, THINGS ARE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME. YOU KNOW, I HAVE THIS FEELING I USED TO GET WHEN I WAS A KID. I KEEP THINKING SOMETHING'S GOT TO CHANGE. IT'S LIKE GIBBY SAID. I KEEP WONDERING IF THIS IS ALL THERE IS. MAYBE I'LL FIND OUT. MAYBE TOMORROW.
