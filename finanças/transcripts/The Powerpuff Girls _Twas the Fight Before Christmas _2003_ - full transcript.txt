Sugar, spice, and everything nice These were the ingredients chosen To create the perfect little girls But Professor Utonium accidentally Added an extra ingredient to the concoction-- Chemical X Thus, The Powerpuff Girls were born Using their ultra-super powers Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup Have dedicated their lives to fighting crime And the forces of evil! Narrator: 'Twas the city of Townsville, and all through the town, All the townsfolk are stirring as snow's falling down. It's bitter and freezing in the dead of December, But there's reason for joy, if you can remember. For it's this time of year that our story unfolds, When our hearts are the warmest, despite all the cold. Yes, it is Christmas, just two days before, And all through the town, none can wait anymore... For the timely arrival of one certain fat guy... Who brings us all goodies from out of the sky. Full of anticipation are these urban folks, None more so than the students at old Pokey Oaks. Ms. Keane: Thank you, Billy. Well, thank you, Kristen. Thank you, Clara. Santa doll: Ho ho ho! Ho ho ho! Ho ho ho! Christmas time is in a few days, fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Santa'll give me lots of toys, yay, fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Buttercup: Bubbles! I'm trying to concentrate! Bubbles: I'm only trying to spread some Christmas cheer. Buttercup: Well, can it! I'm busy. Blossom: Doing what? Buttercup: Writing my wish list for Santa. Bubbles: Are you crazy? You're only giving him two days to prepare - and that's even if he gets it on time! Buttercup: Oh, yeah? When did you send yours, smarty-pants? Bubbles: December 26. Buttercup: Hah! That's after Christmas. Bubbles: December 26, last year. (raspberry.) Buttercup: Oh, no! What if I don't get my official Red Raider carbine-action two- hundred-shot range-model air rifle? Princess Morebucks: Hah! Who would want a stupid old BB gun? Girls: (Gasps) Princess! Princess: Besides, you'll shoot your eye out. Since my daddy buys me anything I want, I only have one thing on my list for Santa: to be a Powerpuff Girl! Blossom: Don't hold your breath, Princess. Princess: What?! Why? Bubbles: Because Santa has his own list, and he checks it twice. It says who's naughty and who's nice. Princess: So? Bubbles: Duh! You're naughty. Princess: (Gasps) Nuh-uh! Blossom: Yeah-huh. Princess: Nuh-uh! Buttercup: Yeah-huh. Princess: Nuh-uh! Bubbles: Yeah-huh! Princess: Prove it! Blossom: You bought the city and legalized crime! Buttercup: You hired Mojo to try and destroy us! Bubbles: You gave us a bomb for our birthday! Buttercup: You teamed up with three felons and went on a crime spree! Bubbles: You tricked our friend Robin into stealing, and then you tattled on her! Blossom: You're a spoiled brat who's greedy and jealous, and you don't care who you step on to get what you want! Princess: And your point is...? Girls: (sigh) Blossom: The point, Princess, is that you better change your ways, or all you're ever gonna get from Santa is a big fat lump of coal in your stocking. Santa doll: Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho (kick) Kids: Cheering Ms. Keane: Okay, kids...ooh! Hold your horses. Kids: Cheering Ms. Keane: Bye-bye now. Merry Christmas. Happy holidays. Be nice for Santa. Ms. Keane: Remember: he's watching you. Ms. Keane: Ooh! (suspenceful music) Princess: Spoiled?! Greedy?! Bratty?! Naughty?! Naughty?! Driver! Do you know what those rotten awful Powerpuffs said to me today? Princess: They said I was naughty! Can you believe that? Driver: (coughs) Princess: Me? Naughty? I'm not naughty, am I? Driver: Well, uh...I'll...oops! Seems my finger has slipped. Whew. That was close. (telephone ring) Princess: (over phone) Well? You didn't answer my question! Driver: (imitating static) You're-you're-you're breaking up!...I'm going through a...unnel...alk...late... Princess: (pounding the glass) No, we're not! I'm in the car, you twit! Princess: Servant, tell me. Do you think that I'm naughty? Princess: WELL? Servant: (stammering) I think my...biscuits are burning. Princess: Nanny! Nanny: Yes? Sweetheart? Princess: Am I naughty? Nanny: Time for bed! Lights out. Princess: Wait! I need another pillow! Fine! I'll just go get it myself! Princess: Naughty, huh? I'll show you who's naughty! Princess: And all these years I thought that coal in my stocking came from Daddy's coal mine! Princess: Who does that blimp think he is, denying me presents? Princess: Oh! Well, this time I am gonna be a Powerpuff Girl! And I'm sure not gonna let some elf with a weight problem stop me! Princess: Hah! Well, I'll show him - and I'll show those Powerpukes who's naughty and who's nice! Narrator: She entered her jet, to her man gave a yell, And away Princess went, with a plot, I can tell. Princess: To the North Pole! And step on it! Narrator: And left no one aware of the web she would weave... Not even the girls, preparing for Christmas Eve. Blossom: Okay. On the count of three. One...two...three! Bubbles, Buttercup: I win! I get to put the star on the tree! Blossom: I don't think so. Buttercup: Aw, man! Bubbles: No fair! Blossom: Okay, Professor! Professor: Here we go! (Chuckles) Girls, Professor: Ooooh! Girls, Professor: Awwww... Girls, Professor: Ooooh! Awwww... Girls: (Gasps) Awwww... Professor: (moaning) Not again! Professor: Every year it's the same darn thing. I can make three little kids out of seasoning, but I can't get these lights to work! Narrator: Ahh, Professor, get to it. You fix up those lights. Everything must be perfect on this most happy of nights. Townspeople: (to the tune of "Deck the Halls") Public domain Christmas songs, fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Narrator: A night so many people throughout the whole city... Share with brother and sister, Mom, Dad, puppy, and kitty. Narrator: And all of the younguns are waiting with glee, Thinking only of morn and what's under that tree. Narrator: And not just the children, the teenagers too. Narrator: Chuck wants a football. Narrator: Kathleen, a tattoo. The grownups as well have gifts that they crave. Ms. Keane only wishes for Mitch to behave. Narrator: A My Little Horsey with combable hair... Is on the top of the list of our honorable Mayor. Narrator: Ms. Bellum longs for a facial made of sea salt and moss... To ease stress she endures from her ridiculous boss. Narrator: And even those foes with hearts full of spite... Also eagerly await the gifts they'll get tonight. Narrator: And beyond the boundaries of this particular town, More hoping and wishing can be found all around. Narrator: The whole world's fallen under the Santa Claus spell. And on this eve of all eves, their hearts start to swell. From Paraguay to Paree, from Tucson to Timbuktu, The world's children are hoping their dreams will come true. Narrator: But these dreams are about to be foiled... By an evil young girl who's nothing but spoiled. (spy music) Princess: Stupid snow! Stupid floor! Princess: Ahhh! Ho ho ho! (Approching Elf Voices) Fat elf: And I said, "If you want a wooden duck whittled, that there is your man." Thin elf: The man can whittle. Fat elf: Oh, he sure can. Whittle, whittle, whittle, whittle, whittle. (spy music) Princess: (yelp) Princess: Now, if I were a big fat bearded oaf... ...where would I keep a stupid list? Princess: "Nice. Agatha Aarons, Arnold Adams..." Princess: (raspberries) "Bubbles, Blossom, Buttercup"? "Mitch Mitchelson"?! You gotta be kidding me! "Zachary Zimmerman." Where's my name? (Angry sigh) (angry yell) (suspenceful music) (gasps) Princess: "Naughty." "Princess Morebucks." (maniacal Laughter) Narrator: She spoke not a word; she had finished her work, And took leave of her lie with a satisfied smirk. Narrator: Meanwhile, three children we know are heading to bed... With thoughts of the morning and what lies ahead. Narrator: The girls drift off to sleep, their hopes at their heights, While their dad is downstairs, still working on the lights. Narrator: But there's yet one more little girl filled with anticipation, Not for worldwide rejoicing, but her plot's activation. Narrator: An evil gleam in her eye, this little redhead... Is the sole one aware there is something to dread. Narrator: She knows that these fools, content in their sleep, Will, because of her, awaken and weep. For tomorrow, the world is in for a big huge surprise... Not candy and presents, but Christmas' demise! (roof creaking) (sleighbells) Bubbles: (giggling) Girls! Girls! Girls! Wake up! I heard Santa! He's been here! Bubbles: (giggling) Professor: (snoring) Bubbles: (Gasps) I know I heard him. Bubbles: What? The stockings! Bubbles: (Gasps) No! Bubbles: No, no, no, no! ...Noooo! Bubbles: WAKE UP! Buttercup: Yay! Presents! Let's go, baby! Bubbles: No! Blossom: Whoo-hoo! Bubbles: But wait! Buttercup: What the heck? Blossom: Santa hasn't even been here yet! Bubbles: Yeah-huh. I heard reindeer on the roof. Buttercup: Oh, yeah? Then where are all the presents? Bubbles: That's what I've been trying to tell you! THERE ARE NO PRESENTS! Blossom, Buttercup: What?!? Bubbles: (rapid fire) Listen, okay, okay. Me and Octi were dancing with pirates in a pond, when a man in a gorilla suit started yelling. So I woke up, and then I heard Santa on the roof. And I tried to wake you up, but I couldn't, 'cause you wouldn't wake up. So I went down the hallway, and the Professor was snoring... ...so I came downstairs to see what Santa left... ...even though I know I'm not supposed to. But there weren't any presents under the tree, just ornaments hanging! Like that cute little shoveling-snowman one, which is really my favorite because it's funny that a snowman would be shoveling snow, when he's made of snow! (giggles) So then I looked in my stocking, but there wasn't candy. Instead, there was coal! Can you believe it? Coal! In my stocking! Which is just ridiculous, 'cause why would Santa give me coal? So I looked in your stockings, and there was coal there too! So I looked next door, and they didn't have any gifts either! Only coal in their stockings, and all the other kids on the block! Blossom: (angrily) You went through other kids' stockings? Bubbles: No! I saw through the houses. Duh! X-ray vision! Blossom: Bubbles, you should know better. Buttercup: No wonder you got coal in your stocking. Bubbles: (snarling) I already had coal in my stocking before I looked at the other kids' stockings! Buttercup: Oh, really? Then why don't me and Blossom have coal in our stockings? Bubbles: You do! Blossom: Me? Buttercup: You gotta be kidding. Blossom: Really? Buttercup: Nuh-uh. (Gasps) Blossom: Buttercup I can understand, but...me? Buttercup: (incensed) Hey! Bubbles: See? Blossom: This can't be right. Buttercup: Um...yeah! Bubbles: It-it was a mistake. He must not have checked his list twice like he's supposed to. Blossom: We better find Santa and set this straight. Ho... Bubbles: ...ho... Buttercup: ...ho! Girls: Let's go! (giggles) Princess: Hello, Powerpuffs! I've come to deliver you your Christmas present: A fourth and more powerful member of your team! Princess: Me! Princess! Girls: What?! Princess: That's right! You can't deny me any longer! Santa realized that I was the only truly nice kid in the whole world and that you were naughty for not giving me what I want! Princess: So now every kid in the world gets coal! And I get what I've always deserved: To be a Powerpuff Girl! Buttercup: This is so wrong! Blossom: How could Santa believe that Princess is nice? Bubbles: Excuse me? How could Santa believe that I am naughty? Buttercup: 'Cause you snooped on other people's presents! Bubbles: Look. I already told you, I only looked 'cause we didn't have any presents, so I wanted to see if any other kids had any presents. Blossom: Enough chatter, girls. We better find Santa and fast. Princess: Oh, no, you don't. I knew you conceited little ingrates wouldn't be able to accept the fact that Santa thinks you're naughty. Princess: But I'm not gonna let you brats ruin my Christmas. Buttercup: Forget it, Princess. We're so gonna tell Santa on you! Princess: Not if I tell on you first. Bubbles: We didn't do anything? Princess: Oh, yeah? "Oh, Santa Claus, as the only nice child in the whole world, I felt it was my duty to warn you about the three naughty girls who were so angry you gave them coal..." "...that they're coming to destroy your workshop and ruin Christmas forever." Oh, Santa... ( laughter echoing) Bubbles: Oh! Yaa! Buttercup: Bubbles! Blossom: She'll catch up. We can't let Princess get ahead of us. Buttercup: Ow! Quit it! Ow! Quit it! Ow! Quit it! Buttercup: QUIT IT!!! Princess: Thanks, Einstein! Blossom: (sarcastically) Good job, Buttercup. Bubbles: Yeah, nice one. Buttercup: Oh, shut up! Princess: Out of the park! Two down... Blossom: Ha! Payback! Princess: Thanks, Einstein! Princess: No fair! Princess: No fair! Princess: (drawn-out) NO FAIR! Princess: Cool it, girls! Princess: Hey! How'd you like my stocking stuffer? Buttercup: Stuff that! I can't believe that worked. Narrator: More rapid than eagles, the coursers they came, And they screamed and they shouted and called each other names. But in a toymaker's shop way up ahead, A jolly old elf was filled up with dread. Narrator: This one Christmas Eve weighed great on his soul, Back from his night of delivering coal. Santa: (angrily) Ho ho ho! What's with all the crashing and the smashing, and the smashing and the crashing? Huh? I'm out delivering coal all night long, and I come home to the Smashing-and-Crashing Gang? Bubbles: But-- Santa: Uh-uh! No buts! I ain't listenin' to no buts from some no-good naughty kids! And no no-good little naughty kids are gonna tell me what's what! Santa: 'Cause guess what? Santa: ANSWER ME!!! Blossom: (nervously) Uh... Santa: That's right! First time, first time it's ever happened. Every last little no-good, good-for-nothin' kid in the stinkin' world was naughty! Santa: Naughty! Naughty! Naughty little kids the world over! Except for one. One nice sweet little girl. Buttercup: You're wrong! Santa: (angrily) Oh, I am, huh?! Well, I's gots the list, baby. Santa: Check it! Princess: Yeah! Check it! Santa: Yeah! A million bazillion good-for-nothin's on this list! And one little itty bitty, perfect little angel over here. Princess: Nyah! Bubbles: That's not right! Maybe you didn't check the list twice! Buttercup: Yeah! Princess is the naughtiest kid ever! Blossom: She must've snuck up here and switched the lists! Princess: Nuh-uh! Santa, don't listen to them! They're just jealous 'cause they got coal. Princess: They're jealous 'cause I'm nicer, I'm smarter, and I'm prettier, and I'm better than them - so they wouldn't let me be a Powerpuff Girl. That makes them naughty! Santa: You mean, the Powerpuff Girls? Not the same Powerpuff Girls who are always helping people and saving the day and being really good? I mean, really good? Santa: Yeah, yeah. See, that explains all the flying and floating and stuff. Princess: Ahem! But I should be a Powerpuff Girl! Me! Not them! Me! My daddy says I'm better! My daddy says I'm the best! And if you're too much of a fatheaded fathead to see that, I'll tell my daddy! Princess: And he'll come and build a parking lot over this cheap little arts- and-crafts popsicle stand of yours! Got it?! Princess: So, you better give me whatever I want for Christmas... ...'cause my daddy says I get whatever I want, whenever I want it! And if that means all of those lousy, worthless, second-rate, bargain-basement brats in the world don't get anything for Christmas, then that's just the way it's gonna have to be! Princess: 'Cause I am better than them! And it says so right here! Princess: So put that in your pipe and smoke it, Santa Clod! Santa: LIST, SCHMIST! (tearing paper) I don't need no stinkin' list tellin' me who's naughty and who's nice! Santa: You know why? 'Cause I'm Santa Claus! Check it! Princess... Santa: ...You have gone and worked my last nerve! Princess: Ow! Ow! Santa: I have no other choice. You are so rotten, so despicable, so naughty... I'm putting you on the... Santa: ...Permanent Naughty Plaque! Santa: (imitating dramatic horns) Bum-bum-bummm! Princess: (Gasps) Princess: (screams) You can't do that! I'm telling my daddy! Princess: (Gasps) (Screams) Princess: (in distance) NO FAIR! Buttercup: Wow, Santa! We didn't know you could give kids superpowers for Christmas. Santa: Eh. No one's ever asked. Blossom: Santa, it's almost morning! What about all the nice children who got coal? Santa: It's all right, girls. (cracking knuckles) I've pulled rush jobs before. All it takes is... Santa: Oh! Bubbles: (small voice) All those poor boys and girls. Santa: Hundreds of years of perfect attendance. Santa: (sobbing) A couple of close calls...but we've always made it. But now... ...I'm ruined. (bell tolls) Santa: Powerpuff Girls, with your streaks so bright, won't you deliver the Christmas gifts tonight? Blossom: We'd be honored, Santa, and we'll do our best. Santa: (wearily) Good, 'cause my head's killing me. Narrator: So all 'round the world the Powerpuffs flew, With a sack full of toys and a giggle or two. Girls: (giggles) They knew that their job was to fly through the skies... And deliver the gifts before the sun should arise. They spoke not a word, but took care of their deed, Delivering gifts at a breakneck speed. Narrator: Their streaks ribboned the sky, their swiftness severe. They'd have sure been the envy of eight certain reindeer. In and out of all chimneys, each and every abode, Gift by gift, they completed the task they were bestowed. Dollies and race cars, horseys, choo-choos, and blocks, Teddy bears! Puppy dogs! (less enthused) Underwear and socks. All these items slipped under every child's tree, Arranged rather nicely by these super girls three. Narrator: They were making good time, even though they were rookies, So they stopped once or twice to have milk and some cookies. Narrator: Then at last they were done - whew! - just before dawn. So they sped back to Townsville, to home with a yawn. Narrator: They entered their room, for the wear no less worn, And snuggled into bed to await Christmas morn. Professor: Girls! Wake up! Wake up! It's Christmas! It's Christmas! He came! Santa came! Professor: Come on, come on! Let's go open the presents, come on, let's go, let's go, let's go! I think somebody might have gotten that new atom splitter they've been eyeing! Professor: Come on, come on, come on, come on! (giggles.) Bubbles: Professor, it's too early! Blossom: We'll open presents later. Buttercup: Go back to bed! Bubbles: Wait a minute. Blossom: What are we saying? Buttercup: Who cares if we're tired? Girls: It's Christmas! Girls: Presents! (happy chatter, mixed with the sound of wrapping paper being torn off) Narrator: Now all the nice kids of the world won't get stiffed. They'll look on with pure joy at every wrapped gift. So paper's torn open and ribbon unfurls, 'Cause Christmas was saved... ...thanks to the Powerpuff Girls!
