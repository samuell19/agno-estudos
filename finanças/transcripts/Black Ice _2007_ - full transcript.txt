My love. Thank you. One, two, three, four... We're not buying anything! Come in. Hi, Krista. Look at your cheeks, brother. Are we interrupting something? Go, Joonas! So, where?s the birthday girl? Sorry everyone, took me a while. - It's okay. Happy birthday, Saara darling. Welcome to the club. - Thanks. Happy birthday! - Hold on, I'd like to give a speech. Saara, I know you think my speeches are boring, which they are. I'm not going to start babbling banalities - like that I have ten more years to come up with a better speech - for your 30th birthday. No, seriously. Saara, you're a wonderful woman and I love you. Cheers. Happy birthday to you... What do you think about this, Ilkka? It says five on the packet, and there are... Three left. How many are there missing? - Two. I totally agree. Do you know where the missing ones are, Leo? Will you tell her or shall I? Okay, I'll start. Kettunen got an idea to test the strength of a scale model - by running some water through it at high pressure. He figured the model wouldn't hold five liters of water. It would end up on the office floor and we'd have to build a new model. So we decided to put a condom inside the scale model - attach it to a hose with self-vulcanizing tape - and run some water in to it at high pressure. So we did - and then we checked the structures of the scale model. We turned it on to its side and poured the water into the sink. The model was intact, the floor was dry. Kettunen said it was amazing no one had thought about that before. Yeah. - We should patent the idea. Will you put that away, or should we leave? Why? Leo and I are putting up a circus. Uncle Leo will be... Peter Pan-Pants down and I'll be the clown. Don't freak out now. - Freak out? Freak out? Who teaches you those words? A pre-schooler? You play doctor together, don't you? Excuse me. I don't have any balloons. Luxurious. Let's give Daddy a trophy. What have you been up to? I'm really pissed off right now. Silence is not enough for me. Name? Tell me her name. What name? - Her name. I could tell you I've been screwing some woman, but I haven't. I just want you to be honest. Well, Kettunen thought that... For the last time, there is no one. Jesus. He probably had some one-time fling at one of their idiotic parties. That's all. I think I can forgive that. After all, Leo is not a compulsive liar. Do you know anything about this, Lea? If someone has been fooling around over there, it's Ilkka. Thrilled to be admired by adolescent girls - who are awestruck when these self-important seniors go on about - "imitating functionalism" and "richness of detail"... Doctor Laakso, an emergency section. Probably a ruptured placenta. The mother's lost a lot of blood. According to her husband, she fell down the stairs. Order four bags of red cells and two for backup. How far along was she? - 26 weeks. These things happen. Thanks to you, at least the baby is alive. Leo Laakso. Hi, honey. I've had a shitty day. Will you be home soon? I have to take a look at a diploma work here at school. Can you reschedule? I'd like to talk to you. It'll take me a couple of hours. - Well, try. I need you to. I'll see what I can do. - Okay. Bye. Bye. - Bye. Call me. You're amazing. See you tonight! Tuuli Students' home pages You haven't got a dobok yet? Do you have a receipt for payment? 180 centimeters. There should be ten centimeters extra. The locker room is over there. Welcome. Welcome to the beginner's class. This is Komu, my assistant. Okay, let's run around the hall. Keep going. Pick a partner of your own size, and we'll practice. From the side of your ear. Aim all the way. Haven't you got a partner? I can do it with you. Try to follow my rhythm. Okay, that's it for today. I have to admit I'm pissed off. Thanks for helping me out. - What do you do besides that? I'm a student. - Is that so? I'm supposed to graduate in spring. - That's great. Hi, honey. I'm sitting in a car. My bike was nicked from the front of the gym. How should I know? Some fucking psychopath. Yes? Oh. Bummer. So, when will I see you? Wait, Leo. I'm glad you called. You saved my day. Bye. What do you do? I'm a psycho...logist. It's a really interesting field. You're always learning new things and no two days are alike. Please take that lane. I could buy you a beer for the annoyance. I have some things to do. - Some other time then. Thanks for the ride. - Yeah. Hey... Do I owe you anything? - No, no. Well... I'm Tuuli. Crista... with a C. Stretch in a couple of hours, or you'll be sore. See you at the gym. Where have you been? I've been trying to call you, but you don't answer. I canceled all my appointments. I've been worried sick about you. Weren't we supposed to talk? Hey, this is getting cold. So? What do you want to talk about? I'm moving out. At least for a while. Uh, what for? Have you met someone? Hey, look at me. I want to know where we are. I want to know who I am and who you are. Negative, thank God. I'm starving. Take a wider stance. Good. Breathe in through the nose and out of your mouth. Good. Crista? Crista? Yeah? - Will you join us? Where? - Out to party. How aware are you of the fact that you're a titman? You're a classic titman. - I'm not! Nothing wrong with that, just admit it. Look at me and say: "Hi, I'm Komu and I'm a titman." He's always checking out your ass at the gym. Can a guy be an assman and a titman at the same time? Yes, he can. He's quite fuckable. Do you have a family? I got divorced. Just recently. Another round, please. With ice? - Crista! After-party! May I see your ID? Welcome. Who wants a beer? - I do. Are you alright? - Yeah. One of them too. No, don't take a picture. I'm not very photogenic. Hi. - Hi. Come in. Is this your diploma work? - Yeah, it'll never be finished. It's great. You're talented. That's my boyfriend. - So you drew his morning hard-on. Extra centimeters on his weenie, to make him happy. Where is he now? Probably with his wife. How long have you been dating? Almost a year now. Doesn't that kind of a situation bother you at all? I love him. That bothers me a little. Come in. Have you had a party? He was in my bedroom with Crista. Right. Hi. - I'm sorry I left like that. I had to see a client. It's good you called. We have a situation. Would you tell this paranoid guy where you spent the night? Leo Laakso. Hi. Crista Ericsson. - Well, hi. Tuuli just has an over-active imagination. That's alright. Thanks. Bye. Hi. I'm hung-over and horny. Shit... Don't. So young and so cautious. You need something... transparent, like glass bricks. And high, narrow windows. Just spice it up generously. You have six more months. Your ass is transparent. Look at that, an old man hanging round the school. This is a student of mine. Yeah, Leo and I just fucked under the table. Do you have marital problems? I happen to have a night off. No... I have a bit of an identity crisis going on. Looking for a direction... Yeah, I'm Ilkka. Tuuli Tikkanen, hi. - This idiot's business associate. Leo, by the way, we should go to the construction site. They've screwed up with the air-conditioning. We should do something about it. Why don't I just... Shall I close the door? - You do that. I don't want my wife to think - that we're separating because of another woman. Those lies of yours are contagious. I'll get sick soon. Do you have time to go for a glass of wine? No, I'm busy. Leo! Which hand are you using? You know, down like this... - Right. Gratz. Crista Ericsson. Congratulations. Saara, are you seeing someone? Saara! Tell me details. Is he single? Where did you find him? How old is he? "A bit younger". What else did my sister say? They have a lot to talk about, they get along great. About what? PlayStation? - You should know. I wouldn't be in this mess - if you hadn't stuttered with that story. You think Saara would believe something like that? I'll get the blame and I've done nothing. - Yes you have. Is it more acceptable to yearn for some distant crush for years - than to fuck a little sometimes? What did you say? To fuck a little sometimes. To fuck a little? - To fuck a little. How do you fuck a little, by keeping still? You go to your daughter's skating practices... It's figure skating. - Sorry. Just so you can stalk her friend's mum. That coach... She has a clear view of... You know where your view is? Of the coach's ass. I haven't been messing around with her. Look me in the eye. You have thought about it. Come on! - It's the actions that count. "It's the actions"... Okay, I'll fuck her for you - so you, Saara and Lea can lay the blame on me. You, an innocent existentialist... You're a sexistentialist whose morals are hanging down there. That's insulting - no matter how much you disguise it as a truth. If you want more problems, go ahead and "fuck a little". "Disguise it as a truth"... Leo, is your brain frozen? I've known Saara as long as I've known you. Saara is a great woman. Smart. Unless you want to lose her, you have to tell her the truth. Wipe the slate clean. Apologize, and hope for the best. To love. - Yeah. Where did you meet? At our school's fancy dress ball. He met his wife there too. What's his wife like? Beautiful. Have you met her? - I saw them together once. Leo has always cheated on her. He had another woman when they got engaged. And the next time Leo cheated, they were married. And the next time he cheated, they built a house. Their relationship goes forward according to Leo's affairs. He can do whatever he wants. His wife gets to play a martyr. Does the wife know about you? She must know. On some level. At least I hope so. What makes these so tight? My dear ex-husband, L... Peter. How do you really feel about that? How do I really feel? I feel... Very awful. I've spent too much time thinking how to kill my ex's girlfriend. How to hurt her. I want her gone. I want her never to have existed. I want to cut her open. Destroy her. Where shall we dump the body? There. Lovely. It's Peter. Let me tell him... - No. Hi, I have a guest. I can't talk right now... - Peter! No one you know. We're going to a bar, so... Peter! We're going to a bar! - None of your business anymore. We'll pickup men and screw around... One day Peter will realize you're an amazing woman. My battery is out. Can I borrow your phone? Thanks. Directory enquiries, how may I help you? The number for Saara Laakso, Espoo. We have one in Kirkkonummi. - That's right. Put me through. Are you out of your mind? - I know how to handle this. I'm a psychologist and a grown woman, for God's sake. Saara Laakso. Please leave a message. - A machine. I'm your ex-husband's girlfriend's best friend- and I have something to tell you. I know exactly what kind of a person you are. You're a pathetic, middle-class, bourgeois control freak. Stay away from Leo or you're going to die. There, that's it. You're my friend, or so I assume. I'm not your client. This is what you've hoped for, isn't it? Is this Crista some kind of an idiot? What do you want? I have to go and settle this thing now. I need to think. What about the party? Go away. Tuuli... Good afternoon. Tuuli Tikkanen? ...best friend and I have something to tell you. I know exactly what kind of a person you are. You're a pathetic, middle-class, bourgeois control freak. Stay away from Leo or you're going to die. The call was made from your cell phone. - Yep. Guilty. Who is this "best friend"? - That's me. Doesn't sound like you. Do you really want to take the sole responsibility for this? Alright. Doctor Laakso has filed for a restraining order. You're not to go within 100 meters of Doctor Laakso's home. 30 meters of the door of her workplace. You're not to contact Laakso nor the members of her family- by phone, letter or e-mail. May I use Morse code? Take your hair off your ears. Turn your head. Don't let her in the hospital. There's a restraining order. What's so special about her? Elasticity? Rectal penetration? You look gorgeous. I'll bring you a big jar of lubricant from work - if you tell me what the hell goes on in your head. I've missed you like crazy. You've been having an affair for a year. A year! Hi. Wait a second, I'll find a better place to talk. Just a moment. Why haven't you come to the gym? - I've had other things. I kind of miss you. - Really? Well? Leo dumped me. Did he? Can we go for a beer or something? We'll see. I'll try to come over. I'm pretty busy for the next couple of weeks. You don't smoke anymore. - No. You told my sister this guy, this Jore, is a bit younger than you. Yeah, 29. - God dammit! What do you want? What do I want? I want someone who's not me-me-me all the time. My engagements, my deadline. I want someone I can trust. Someone to talk to about my feelings. Do you have feelings for him? - We laugh at the same things. I'm absolutely never going to see that chick again. Leo, you spend time with her. You make love to her. She's your fucking girlfriend and you call her a chick. Tell me... What magic trick would you try to make me trust you again? Saara, I love you. I want to be together. I want to have a baby with you. Listen to yourself. I want to take care of it, and you. - Why don't I believe you? Come home. - How could I? How could I live from day to day? Tell me. I love you, but I don't know what to do about that. Come home. Are you going to talk to that Jore? I'll talk to him face to face. Don't worry, honey. It's so great to see you. Tuuli... - Come in. Tuuli, I came to apologize. It's not your fault. This is about... About Peter. We got back together. What happened? - Well, we... We had a talk. I guess we'll give it a try. Tuuli, I'd like to stay friends with you. No matter what happens. What are you fretting about, woman? You're the only person I trust. I won't have this! Where are you going? Today is my and Leo's anniversary. I don't want to go alone. Can you come with me? - No. Crista... I need you. I must go and talk to him. - You have nothing to say to him. I'm afraid that I may be pregnant. How late are you? - Maybe three weeks. What are you going to do if you're pregnant? Hell, I don't know! Oh goodness... I spilled my drink. On my hands. Luckily my dress was saved. Look what a fucking moron! Komu, would you fuck off? Hell, his wife is here. - Let's leave, you have straining order. She'll kill you. Trust me, I know her profile. - No! Hey! Hey! - Hey. It's me. Howdy-ho. - Well, hello. Are you buying a sleigh or garden gnomes this time? Excuse me? - Are you a fucking pervert?! Is it okay with you that last week your husband was seeing me - and tonight he's hitting on little girls? Are you talking about my husband? - Fuck, yeah! Really? - Fucking really. Well... thank you. Let me shake your hand. Thank you for having the energy to fuck my husband. He's been that much better at home. Thank you. No problem. What ever tickles your fancy. In case you didn't know, we have two children. Take me away from here. Show me the girl and we'll go talk to her! Don't yell at me! - Calm down. Don't. It's so insulting you didn't tell her we have two children. Doesn't matter what I say... Do you want me to lie? Where are we going? I have a surprise for you. Wake up. We're here. We're here. Come in. Oh well, I need to pee anyway. Crista! I dropped it in there. Oh fuck, I'm such a monkey! Sorry, I'll get you a new one. You could feel with your fingers if your cervix is dilated. That's how you fucking find out. - What? Wow, what a place. When I was a student, I lived upstairs in number six. You told me that already, old man. No I didn't. Old man... You're lovely. You're truly lovely. But you know what? I need to go now. What a shame. Honestly, we have a lot of booze. Come on. We never run out of booze. Crista? What are you doing? - Did you fall asleep? Can I take a shower? - Yeah, go ahead. You were supposed to talk to him. Now you've brought him to our house. Well? Positive. - Hell, no! I don't get to father your baby, but some goddamn Jore does? Are you trying to get back at me for something? Saara, I love you. Do you? - I do. If you do this to me, you'll destroy everything. Leo, wait! Come back, you idiot! What are you doing here? Are you okay? - Yes. Then you can walk home. I'll go this way. I need to see Doctor Laakso. - Okay. Looks like she's not here today. - Right. I'd like a termination of pregnancy. Whichever doctor is fine. Okay. This is a shitty hospital. Let's start. Knee up, hip forward, turn the support leg. Hade, can you show us? Let me have it. Take off your protectors and get the knives. I need to talk to you, about Leo. Make a formation. Hi. Is Tuuli here? - No, I don't know any Tuuli. Hi. Hi. Where's your idiot business associate? Where... Oh hell. Sit down. Tuuli... Doctor Laakso, please. - Do you have an appointment? I have terrible pain in my lower belly. - Okay. Name and date of birth? Crista... Ericsson. April 11th, 1978. Wait in the clinic lobby. On the sixth floor and to the right. What are you looking for? I don't have time to explain. - Do you have a problem? An STD? This is psychosomatic. - Funny. Where'd you come up with that? An emergency section, probably a ruptured placenta. Can you tell me how far along you are? Can you tell me? 26 weeks. Do you know this patient? Crista. Saara. Everything good...
