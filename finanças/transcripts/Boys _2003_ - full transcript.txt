You can't speak in English, she'll never fall for you. You look like an eunuch. Will she fall for you? I'll smash you all. You are treating her like other girls. I'm making a sincere effort. - Look at him. I'll go. Don't get tensed. Come. Let's show our talents. Who ever succeeds, she becomes his. Others must simply walk out, okay? Okay. Pour. I'll can only piss in it. It's empty. Munna, lets make him the scape goat. Hello sir, I'm Munna.- What? Munna.- Its okay. Where did you buy this shirt? I stole it from next door. Can't you see? Allen Solly, Rs.1400. It is superb.- Thanks. - Match box please. Thank you sir. Can I borrow a cigarette? Do you have the habit smoking only borrowed cigarettes? Do you borrow everything from others? You seem to be joking. I'll become serious all of a sudden. Is this chilly chicken? - I don't know. Give me a piece. I'll give it back when I get mine. The entire plate is just like a piece for you. Eat. You drink, but you don't have a ponch. I don't take beer, only hot drinks. That is the reason. What are you doing sir? This will remove the gas & other impurities. Our body will remain fit & fine. We can shit with ease in the morning. You seem to have toiled hard in your life. You know lot of things. Are you guys falling for the same girl? Great sir. How did you find out? Can I have a peg? Hey, get me a 1/2 bottle of liquor, eggs & chicken. Buddy, an OTMP. What do you mean by OTMP? M.P. means "Mangalam Padarathu'. (scape goat) What does OT mean? O means ..., T means 'Eat'". ...eat the scape goat. We call it as OB. O means the same. B means fool. Are you boys ogling at the same girl?- Yes sir. It will never work out. Approach her one by one. Be brave...be humble... Be soft... Just look into her eyes & talk. Buddy, we are going tomorrow and express our love. Boys, love is... He's starting to lecture us. Let's escape. Mangalam sir, nice meeting you. Bye. What's it? You made me scape goat & ate well. And when I was about to pour out my feelings, you guys are trying to escape, aren't you? I won't leave you. Better allow me pour out my feelings. Or else vomit everything which you ate for free from me. Pour out your feelings. Bring 1/2 bottle of liquor. Even I loved a girl from my heart & soul. Did she die?- No. She is dead in my heart. This is too much. Then I was unemployed. I thought of marrying her after getting a job. So I asked for 1 year's time. - Did you get a job?- I did. In Hosur, Faizalabad, Dubai... Even in America. But, since I would have been separated from her, I let go all those opportunities. Why? I even got offers of night shift jobs in this city. But, because I won't be able to see her in the evening, I didn't avail those opportunities too. - I can understand. You were hoping to get a job on her lap. Wow! This is immortal love. 1 year passed. One day all of a sudden, she said that a groom from America has been fixed for her. She married him & flew to America.- Then? Then what? Beard, liquor, railway track, noose... I got over all those desperation & now, I've a good job in ICICI Bank. To forget that slot, I drink once everyday. ...once every week, do you apply oil on your navel? If I inform Manickam, he'll bring a moll. A moll a week to forget my lover girl. Sir, can you please give us Manickam's phone number? I'll smash you if you utter his name. You are small boys, don't ruin yourselves. Not for us. But for our friends.- Social service? I too got his number giving the same excuse. Look, this is his visiting card. It contains his pager no, cell no & e-mail id. He's going to open a website next week. Who has started the bike? Sorry sir, Kumar has vomited. Vomited! He has vomited everything. This will be the result if you mix different brands. Though I change brands for every peg. I'm always under control.- Hey Kumar, give us a treat?- For what? For vomiting. Who's that? Even Mangalam sir has vomited. It seems to the original product. That's why it didn't suit me.- Sir, kerchief. No need. I've an attached napkin. That's all.- Sir, lime. - No thanks. If you could kindly move this bureau, I'll take rest. Good night boys. I've been to this place before. - This is your mansion. Careful. Cut(pay) the auto charges. The auto looks good. Why do you want to cut it? You have made me look like Shakeela (actress). Do you want an umbrella? I'm wearing a rain coat. I drank more to forget that slot. How come? Bottom half is getting a relief all of a sudden? Sir, your wallet. I like all you 10 boys. This is my card. Whenever you need help, just call me. I'll come. That girl... Tomorrow... Don't forget. Okay, sir. I wish you all the best for your love. Thank you, Mangalam sir. - Good night Mangalam sir.

You always find fault with him. Wow! My parents are out of station. Kumar, go & buy beer. Let's heal our wounded hearts with Kalyani beer. Why Kalyani beer? Why don't we bring Kalyani(girl) here? How? We got a phone number from Mangalam sir. Let's phone & bring a beautiful moll. We might get AIDS. There is a cap(condom) for that. No, it's wrong. If we get married, we shouldn't...

She co-operated very well. What a moll! What's this? My baby's diaper. Was that your baby?- Yes. Why? Do you want only a virgin? Sorry. She was amazed. She never let me go. She admired my body. She said she will charge nothing for me. Instead, she is read to give me money. I have a doubt? - What is it? Legally this is a crime, isn't it?- Yes. Will the police catch us?- Yes.

Don't disappoint the boys. Don't wear a helmet on your heart? Don't try to stop us in the name of friendship. You won't lose your virginity if you fall in love. Don't treat girls as chewing gum. Don't try to live in my heart. Love is ancient, don't try to dig it. Don't gift a red rose in friendship. Do the thing that you like to do. Do let me win your heart. Let me never stop & let me start. All I want to do is win your heart. Oh! Love is full of pain get lost. Love is just a strain. I don't want to love. Love is not a game... Friendship means RAC, think & confirm your love to me. Friendship means full safety there is no guarantee in love. Yeah, I can clearly see dating is a fantasy. Useless fellows! Girl you know you got me thinking all about you. And I really wanna know if you love me too. Will you let me know because my heart is true. Babe when I see your face I wanna to be with you. Mere smiling is not friendship.

Do you have to remove your mustache too. Who is mad now? You or her? - Perfectly normal. I've read in a psychology book. Only if we do such thrilling acts some girls will like you. Buddy, you're a great one for love. After Adam it's only you. Shall we cover you? She we run along with you holding newspapers on all 4 sides. No, that's cheating. Simple buddy. Cover your back & front with your hands & run. If I do that, it's like hiding my love. Better apply odomos cream on your body. Mosquitoes might bite you. - Idiot! I feel that they are trying to fool you. Oh don't fast, just come. What's it going to be? I'm so sure you'll enjoy yourself.- Is it? You said something now. Look there if there were to fool me, will they come? Why did you bring me here? - You're going to watch a super scene. Look over there. I'll be waiting with the bike on the opposite side. All the best. Hey Munna. Hem Sampatha, have you planned some thing silly? Just watch the fun. Hey, what non-sense... Oh god! My god! I can't believe it. Harini, I did it... I'll do anything for you. Oh! My dress! Hey lorry please stop. stop.. Are you running for world place? - My dress...Lorry stop. What the hell is this? Sorry Harini. I told him that you'll love him if he does such a thing. I just said it for fun. I never thought he will do that, but... Hey, my dress...please Hey stop...please... shit! Buddy, get on the bike. - Move fast. Start the bike, Jue. Boy, what's the time? - I don't have a watch. Start the bike oh! You've nothing on shit! Juju, police...- Get down & push the bike. Go fast.- Stop... - Be careful. Go fast, Juju.- Yes I'm he's behind us. It's the wrong side...go... Driving on the wrong side you rouge. He's behind us go. Take left. Go fast.- Idiot. Have you informed your house? Don't you've any sense? Come on look at him. Go fast, Juju please. Go fast. You sons of the god of death, die somewhere else. You bastard! Catch him. he has capsized my auto. What's all this? If didn't have any sense. where was yours? Is mount road a cricket ground for him to run nude? Sorry sir, we know it was wrong. Somehow get Munna out on bail. Sampatha, he's my friend. Make arrangement to pay the fine. I'll pay that. A charitable case Didn't I buy you half a pack of cigarette? What's this? If your girl friend asks you to jump before a train, Will you jump?- I won't. Why?- I want to live. Tell the court what had happened? Cry & tell them that you did it unwittingly. Doesn't she have any sense? - Don't scold her. Sentimental, are you?- Did they beat you black & blue? Give us a treat once you come out. Look at him? You've given your name as Kunjappan. Though this name suits this case, I doubt whether this is your real name? You've been accused of running nude on Mount road. Do you accept the crime? Why did you do that? My friend laid a bet with me for Rs 1000. I did it for that.- Don't you've any sense. You're a student, aren't you? Are you parents sending you to college for this? Don't you know what you should bet on? Bet to get centum in mathematics. Bet to win in a tennis match. Irresponsible idiots! You'll reform only when you're punished severely. Considering boy's future... - Hey shut up. Do you know the damage done by him? Considering the younger generation... Will they punish him severely? - Yes they are going to hang him, get lost. He is an irresponsible boy. Under IPC section 294 A & Tamilnadu's amendment to it, for running nude in a public place, I order him to pay Rs. 1000 as fine, and imprisonment of 1 day in Saidapet sub-jail. And sign a good conduct bond for 1 year. Are you not coming to the class? - I'm not interested, you go. Are you happy now? Do you know Munna was arrested by the police? He was beaten up in the station, he was fined Rs 1000 & awarded 1 day's imprisonment. He never revealed the truth in the court. Because he felt that it will spoil your name & your future. Atleast now realize that he loves you. It's his cell. Sorry Munna. I swear it wasn't my idea at all. Sampatha played the prank with you. Okay Harini tell me what should I do now? Munna- Harini. Really? Harini...stop... Yes... I jumped & the sky broke into pieces, my feet became a bird, flowers bloomed on the tip of my fingers, my eyebrows slipped down to became my mustache, I bathed in the tears of joy. - All my teeth smiled. Like an ant, I walked carrying a sugar candy, like a leaf, I started to float on water, the moment you expressed your love, I saw God... And my heart blew like the wind. Lightnings have started to pass though my nerves. There's moon in my entire body. When he rubbed against the moon, I broke into stars. A seed fell in my heart. And it has spread its branches all over my head. I was like an undisturbed pond. I become dry the moment a frog jumped into it. Has the sand turned into sugar? Has the sea turned into drinking water? Has the shore been covered with your foot prints? Has the wave been filled with your smile? When papers flew around me they turned into a book of poetry. When the rainbow brushed against me. Even the crow turned into a peacock? I need to take a photo copy. By the way, I'm Hari. I want to take a photocopy of this. - Your hand! Yes. In the beginning, even the owner tried to take a photocopy of his face. But it never came out well. Who's your owner? - It's me. Look at this. It's my son who ran nude. Do you know who inspired my son to make the entire state to laugh at him? It was your daughter. What nonsense?- Your daughter seems to love my son. Hey you're talking non-sense. Your daughter went to jail & wrote an edict on his hand. This fool hasn't washed his hand for the past 2 days. And is eating & cleaning... with the same hand. And he is roaming, keeping his hand like this! Is it true, Harini?- Yes. How dare you?- We'll settle this later. Tell us who is loving whom. We'll settle it through dialogue. Always sitting on that low wall, shaking their legs, smoking, and ogling at the girls who pass by. Now they're boozing in the name of treat. Are you drinking?- No mom. Sir, I'm a grocery merchant. He refuses to sit on the cash counter even for 2 hrs. But he sits on the low wall all day. He's not in good company. This buffalo sits in the toilet for 1172 hr. Ask him what he does? - Daddy please... He reads sex books.- Why are you insulting me? How dare you talk against me? Sir...please uncle... You want be able to bear, if I hit you.- Hit me! Listen to me.- Please forget it. Sit down...Relax.- Krishna, what's all this? Our honour is vanishing into thin air. Moreover, they are dating now. - What's that? They have started this recently. Boys & girls go to beach, hotel, disquothe on bikes, eat all non-sense. They'll hug each other & kiss. Finally, they will come back like lumps of shit. This is too much! We girls are not like that. Mummy, we have ice cream drink Coke & chat together. Keep quiet idiot. We are ready to do whatever you want us to do. We must control their arrogance. Excuse me can I say something? Advise them. It is you whom I must advise. How can your children be blamed? If people around them smoke they'll also smoke. If they see people drinking, they will also feel like drinking. Why? When they see a girl on the street, At this age, they must fall in love. It's natural. No one can stop that. Do you call this as advise? Do we have to lock them in our homes? How is that possible? What's being telecast on the T.V all day? Take a look. In the Mid- Night Masala, after spinning the top, & putting it on the omelet, They're now pouring honey & playing with grapes on the navel. Can't they watch Discovery & Animal Planet channels? I show you, watch. Shit!- It's no better. Two giraffes are romancing. Switch off the TV & take the newspapers. Why do you need Ramba (Actress) for pump set advertisement? Why do you need Mumtaz (Actress) for the cover story of Abdul kalam? You can find an actress half naked on the middle page of any magazines. Look at the drawings used for stories. All drawings have low hip & low neck. Sex in everything. Then how can you expect the boys to be resolute. Then do you want us to ignore them? I'm trying to explain to you that this is common & natural at this age. See, nobody is perfect. Everyone has learnt through mistakes. Leave them, don't torture them. Stop it. Who is he? He's simply blabbering & you're simply listening to him. She's Renuka. I loved & married her while I was studying. What happened? There was resistance from both the sides. We lost our parent's support. My studies got disrupted in the middle. Because of my hasty decision & incomplete studies, I got a server job & later, a child too. I thought of finding a better job, or at least come up in life by doing some business. But I had to stick to my job for Milk powder & a square meal. Till now, I am unable to come up in life. I take loan after 20th of every month. This is all because of love. - He's cent percent right. Even I was in the same boat. But I didn't commit the mistake he committed. If we love & marry at the age when we should be studying, our studies will get interrupted & future will be ruined. So I sacrificed love. Now I'm a customs officer, & we're living luxuriously. I'm able to buy anything that my daughter asks for. It's all because I sacrificed my love. Now tell me, what should he become? A waiter like me or get settled in life like them. Parents who lost their carriers because of love or like the, parents who sacrificed their love for their careers. But I? I've lost both & I'm boozing. Munna, they are also right. Your parents struggle so hard to educate you. Forget about love for some time. Press the pause button for everything. And concentrate on your studies. Your friend has told you, hasn't he? Have you understood? Hereafter no one should meet one another. If the college gets over at 4 'O' clock you must come home by 4.30. Or else no food for you. Let them starve. Don't open the door if they come late. If they talk against you, stop giving them pocket money. If you sit on the low wall, or if you ogle at the girls who pass by. Then, don't come back home. If my son comes to your house, slipper him. If you have a dog set it on him. Girls! this applies to you too. Stop roaming with your boy friends, Stop talking on phone for hours together. Stop sending e-mails from today. Even when the puppies at home are given meat & milk, when they grow up they will run after a street dog. You too! I feel disgusted to see you. Why have you come so soon? - Our professor has died. Oh no!- Half a day leave. You go & sleep, I'm going to study. No. Krishna, are you writing a love letter. Sex story about Malgova aunty. - Come & read. When the aunt was busy cooking, Cockroach got into her jacket. Krishna! she screamed. What do you eat? Food or shit? All of you get out. Even after advising you so much didn't you get any sense? He got spoiled because of you. - Hey, come here. Rascal, show me. Malgova aunty! How dare you write sex stories? - Don't hit my boy. You scoundrel! Are you a legitimate child? You've given birth to a very good child! My hand is paining after beating him. You senseless buffalo. Bring kerosene. I'll pour that on him & I'll torch him. Let him die. Give me 1 kg. mutton. - Put this bulb too. Can I make a phone call? He went to buy mutton. he hasn't come yet. ...I see you, I feel you. That's how I know you...go on. If I don't see you for even a second, I feel like dying. Die, you scoundrel. I told you to by mutton, but you seem to be romancing with this girl. Hey, don't you have any sense? Have they sent you to study or to go round the city? Aunty, mind your words. Or else do you want my son to arrange a room & a bed? Mom, please calm down why are you shouting at her. I'll slipper you if I see you with my son again, I'll hand you over to the police for compelling my son to indulge in prostitution. Get lost you..."Golty". - What did you say? You bastard! It's all because of you. You bastard! It's because of you I had to listen to her abuses. Wait. I'll teach you a lesson. Hey you scoundrel stop...stop stop I'll kill you. You buffalo you rouge! Hey, I had told you not to come here. I came here to study, is it wrong? Can't you study at home? - What's bothering you? Don't I have that much of independence? - I know why you're sitting here. You think those dogs will come here, isn't it? Only one dog has come. - Whom are you calling a dog? I was referring to me. Go...Go home. You idiot! If I see you here again I'll shoot you like a crow. Whom did you call a dog? Stop, the college got over by 4.30. Why are you late? - Special class. KPS informed me that you don't have a special class. Please don't insult me, daddy. - Insult. That's my personal thing! One good boys can have personal things. Who's she? Your mother? Daddy please... No daddy, please... Take your hands off... - Please daddy stop it. Come here.- Sir. - Read this. My dear porcupine. Thorns that pierced into my heart when you hugged me last time, couple of then are still stuck in my heart. Without seeing you, it's like bathing in acid. And wiping with sand paper. And sleeping on a bed of thorns. Blood seems to flow like sweat. It pains even when breeze blows. Why are you parents like this? I don't know whether you'll hammer a nail on your father's bald head. Or stick your mother's plait to it, Meet me at any cost. I want to kiss you from top to bottom. Will you hammer a nail on your parent's heads? You call yourselves students. Drink the urine of my students. Let me see whether you'll reform or not after that. Unusually, you went to the ration shop to buy rice. Are you writing a letter with the grains of rice? Pick up all the grains. - Daddy...Please... ME TOO! shit. Pick them up. Don't leave a single grain. Why are you looking man? Look here & pick up the grains. Why you beating him? - You keep quiet. Renu, do you know what your son has done? Shit! Who has made this place dirty? Who else other than Rasathi. He was writing a letter spilling the grains on the road. Oh my god! Rice.- He has picked them up. Don't give him food for 1 week. - Have you started that again? He must starve, only then he'll reform. A symbolic love! No daddy. Daddy.- Go away. Daddy...Daddy. Let her study in America after her studies are over, we'll conduct the marriage there itself. You're interested aren't you? Sister, even after 6 divorces they are ready to accept. Just writing on the hand. It doesn't matter to me.- Thanks. Where are you going? - To the next room. Do I need to take your permission for that too? Come & sign on this.- What's this? U.S visa application. - Why all of a sudden? Hereafter, you're going to study there. Harish has come to take you there. - My semester exams. are due in November. Just sign. Forget about the semester. Do you have any plan to elope? My god! What's happening? My god! earth quake! All of you run. Go out. It measured 6 on Richter scale. What do you mean by that? - It is like the 1/2 feet scale. Mercury will be present in it and it shows the measure. Don't bluff. Richter scale means seismographic logarithmic scale. That's what I said. Harini, if has been very long since we met. 10 years. Munna, we must do something. I'm unable to live without you. - Me too. They're planning to send me abroad. Oh god? Where?- America. They asked me to sign the visa papers. God triggered the earthquake. - Thank god! How are you? What mistake have we commit? Why are we being punished so severely? I feel like leaving the house. - Yes. I'm afraid they might separate us. - Lets get out. Boys & girls, come here tomorrow morning at 5 a.m. We are going to Tirupathi. - Why? Munna weds Harini. Look, she's trying his best to feel shy. Only today, she looks like a girl. Come & stand here. Today, a rich man is conducting that. It's an auspicious day. Haven't your parents come? He's our father, mother & everything. Oh no! Why are you falling at my feet? - Bless us. May you grow in future & lead a happy life. Go that side. May you live long! I'll make a move.- Go. You've to perform couple of secret marriages. You're absolutely right. Children, when is your marriage? When I get a better groom... Wait. If my parents search for a groom. we'll marry. I'll be the broker for that too, right? What's wrong with you? I'm scared. You go to America, marry your mother's brother. And cry thinking about Munna. Or is this better? Why are you crying? I'm scared. How am I going to support her? In every marriage, people come, wish & go away. We'll be with you. Don't be scared. - Come on cheer up. Mangalam sir... Treat sir. In Tirupathi? Lord Venkat will thrash all of us. Vegetarian meals for everyone I'll sponsor that too. Have we come home?- Home? For your information, You have eloped from your homes. - That's what I told you. Don't fall on me. It seems he'll make me come to Tirupathi again. Mr.Muthukarruppan is my family friend. - Shut up. Oh god! Police. Get down. All of you, get down. We got them sir. Police will thrash us if they catch us. I advised him many times but see what he had done? Bless us.- Blessings! You scoundrel. Why are you shouting at him after allowing your daughter to roam freely? Hey shut up, idiot. He is responsible for all this. Hey, leave my shirt. They are Mafia, Lashkar-e-toiba, Jaise-e-Mohammed. Hey, you shut up. Sir, is it the right age for them to get married? Doesn't have a fully grown mustache also. I have shaved it off. - Hey, shut up. Why did you get married hurriedly while still studying? They forced marriage on us. They know we love each other. If they had promised to get us married after our studies, We wouldn't have rushed to marry. They house arrested & tortured us by not letting to meet each other. They tried to separate us. So, we got married. This is not a marriage at all. File an abduction & kidnapping case on him & put him behind bars for 6 years. Send my daughter home. Look, if they cross 18 yrs, they've the right to take their own decisions. Nobody can stop them. According to law, this marriage is valid. Never, no way. He is her future husband. - Yeah. He lives in America. Ask him to stay there only. - Shut up. She is going to do M.S. there. All the arrangements have been made. With whose consent did you arrange? We needn't ask anybody's consent. We are your parents. I am her husband. I will slipper you. Wait, I will talk to him.- Shut up. Hunger will bring him back to us. Hey, they are married, let them go to the hell. You come. Ask them to take Munna & Harini to their home, then we will come. It is their family problem. How can I interfere? This concerns our friendship. We will not come. We are going to stay together. We are going to help Munna & Harini. You will help. How can they earn their livelihood? They are penniless fellows. They never washed even a hanky at home. Now a days, even a note book costs Rs.60. An Economics book costs Rs.600. A semester fees is more than Rs.6000. When education is so costly, How can they manage it without parental support? In a rush of blood they did it. Please forgive and accept them. Don't spoil their lives with your anger, sir. I must kill you first. You're responsible for all this. If you say anything further, I will not remain a human. Will you develop 2 horns? What is this, sir? Be like a parent. Why are you turning into a dinosaur? Hey, get lost.- Go that side. Why son? Where will you stay if you go out? How will you study? What will you do for food? We told you many times the difficulties we had faced. Don't go son. Hey, why are you begging him? I'm cursing, you'll never come up in life. Watch, you are going to be on streets. How can you say that if we fall in love, we will never come up in life. You say that you had lost your life because of love. They say that only if we sacrifice love, we can come up in life. Why? Can't we succeed in love as well as in life? We will succeed in both and prove it you. Excellent man, you said the latest though it was late. Come lets go.- They are going to come up in life. Everything had happened all of sudden. I can make you stay in my mansion. But ladies are strictly prohibited there. Any 2 of you can come, lets manage. - No sir, we will stay together. I want to make you all stay in my house. But problems will arise. Sorry Harini...- It's okay. Oh, have you already let it to a mouse family? How is the place? Is this enough? - It is enough, we can fold our legs sleep. We will manage it. Don't make noise. Sneak in after everyone has slept, and leave before they get up, okay? Thank you Teju.- It's okay. Tomorrow, I will ask Dandapani to find another house. Simultaneously, I will find part time jobs for you all. Keep this for your expenses. Give me Rs.50 to buy a pint of liquor. We will meet tomorrow, call me on phone, okay? Bye, good night.- Bye sir. Happy first night.- Hey, go guys. We have a seat in the car, and we have hands... Let use our hands as pillow and sleep. Munna, as we are married, it is very easy to cross limits. But all this is important now. Think over it. Do we need pregnancy, delivery, Johnson baby powder... Spend time on it. Or after studying, passing our exams, and reaching a high status. Shall we have it then? Is there non-vegetarian then? - Only vegetarian. Not even an egg? - Only seeing is permitted. When you hide in my dreams. I see you, I feel you. That's how I know you... Teju, come here. Hey Porcupine, what is it? I feel very thirsty.- Oh God. Take it. Oh God! Hey, get lost. Teju, what is that noise? - Rat, grandpa. A flat for my future wife. ...flat, car, A/C, fridge. Buy all this for her & then get married. I had built castles in air. Now look, motor room, grease stains on the cheeks. I have used T.V., Fridge, etc., Happiness isn't in them. But I wish to be with the one I love most. There isn't any happiness beyond that. We can happily run our family even on the garbage. Who is that? Who is she? Who is that? Does love expect this and that. Or does it expect heart? Doesn't young crows sleep on thorns? Doesn't a rose plant grow on garbage? Roof of a coconut shell is enough for our love to flourish. I don't want the ash of gold. But, water is enough. Hey come on. If we fall in love, we can turn even junk shop into Kolar gold fields. If love enters through cracks & crevices, it will turn it into a flute. Wow! With leaves of plants. Lets make a cot out of it. Lets live happily even after like a lamp in the faceless bottle. Lets stick on like a leech to dream & live happily. Like a flying feather of a insect. Lets live by swinging. Lets become earth worms in the slush. We are 2 beetles inside a rotten mango. Buddy, my girl must be waiting, I will go. Okay buddy. Lets meet in Sathyam Theatre. Its getting late. Okay bye... How many litres? Fill the tank dear. Do you have to suffer like this? You must be doing study Ms. Wearing a clown's dress in a petrol bunk, you're dispensing 2T oil. Lube oil. Why do you have to suffer like this? Why are you so adamant? Even now, you can get into the car leaving everything behind. Why did you name me Harini, father? That is... I know father. Your lover's name is Harini. You are unable to forget her. Still you've her letters, kerchiefs, key chain, photo, a strand of hair also. You have kept them safely inside your books. I have seen you looking at them often. You are cheating yourself that you have tasted success in your life. I don't wish to marry somebody and name my son as Munna. Madam, here. - Here is your balance. Keep the change. - No, I am getting my pay. Take it. Complimentary. Has any one else also dead? One is on the verge of death in the Kavarai street nearby. That person will die tomorrow. I will inform you. Okay, what is your address? Krishna, Loyola college, 2nd BBA. Thanks.- Oh student! I am making my livelihood from somebody's death. Are you prepared to do any job? - I will do it. No salary...but you will get variety of food, 3 times a day. Is it okay? That is enough for the present. Take... Hold them. If you go straight you will find Madhava Perumal temple. They will offer hot tamarind rice there. Red chilies, dhal, ground nuts, all these ingredients are added. It will be very tasty. You get that in these 2 vessels. You have it from one and I will have it from the other. Okay.- Leave your bag & go. If you run away my vessels. That's why. He has come. Sit down. Have it. O Lord Muruga! Oh God! Hey, get up. ...its time. Take these...hold this... Where is my diary? What day is today? Saturday. If you go to Anjaneyar temple in Ashok Nagar now. They will offer curd rice with ginger & curry leaves and Vadais. Get them in these 2 vessels. One for you and one for me. Go fast...it may get over. Wow! What do you want? Give me Rs.103 He is unnecessarily shouting at me. Give me the balance. Greetings sir. - I will double it next month. What did I ask you to get?- Beer. I know that. I had asked you to get 5000 brand. But you have brought Kalyani brand. Call your boss. What happened sir? How many years I have been drinking beer in this hotel? Did I ever drink any brand other than 50007 Foolish boy. Hey, did you give him Kalyani brand? I don't know.- Don't know. Look at his ugly face. Go that side. Sir, don't get angry. Hey Sudalai, change it quickly. New boy, unknowingly he had done it. - Ask him to come fast. Don't hit me. Brother, don't mistake me for hitting you. He is my regular customer. He spends Rs.500 everyday here. Hey, get a Biriyani for him. Even my father never beat me till now. More than the beating, its insult affecting me. Have it. Forget it. If you want, hit me back. - Oh no! After having it, comb your hair properly and do your duty. Yes 2. 1,2. I have cut your shell. Your vadai is for me. Saravana Bhavan Time:7.30. Brother, hold this. Who's that breaking the queue? Come in a line. - Come in the queue and take it. Oh have you come? It hasn't become cold, right? Eat contently. Hello, I'm asking you ignorantly. Is this a job? You are staying put in one place and eating. You are a boss and I'm your worker. Okay, why should I get it for you? What if I take and eat it alone? There lies the trick. If you go tomorrow to that place, you'll not get anything. What they'll offer in which temple and on which day. I'm maintaining a complete record of that. When they'll offer vadai in Ayodhya Mandapam, when a politician will provide free meals, when AR. Rehman will provide free biriyani. When will they provide non-vegetarian food in Vijaykanth's office. Raincoat, umbrella, iron box, tailoring machine, spectacles for blind. Only I'll know when they'll give all this on which day and where. Did you see this? I'm maintaining a detailed schedule for 365 days. This information is my principle. I'm not giving you food. But information. Information is wealth. Why are we going all over the places and working hard? Only for this, right? Information! What's your name? - Kannaiyyan Annaveri Kannaiyyan. Hey watch man, Nimmi is barking, isn't it? Take it out for a stroll. My fate. I've to water the plants. Buy vegetables. Get the blouses ironed. I've to dig the garbage and I've to take the dog out. Hey stupid dog, come on... Are you going to pass urine or not? Hey doggy, are you suffering from constipation? Why are you troubling me? Idiot, come on do it. Are you irritating me? Wait idiot. Success. It downloaded 10 days stock at once. Hey idiot, you are ill-treating an animal. Are you a human? I'll complain to the SPCA and get you arrested. You are fired. Run away. Kumar, where's your income? I've bought food for all us from my income. One plate costs Rs.15. My share is Rs.90. There's no side dish also. I can smell sacred ash also. Hey, he has visited temples and brought them. Did you beg? Don't insult me like that. He brought whatever he could afford. He has made a contribution, hasn't he? Whatever it is, we must eat, don't we? We've saved our food expenses. - Sorry buddy. Listen boys. Our earnings are sufficient only for our daily existence. Pizza delivery, petrol pump, wine shop. That can't sustain our education. It'll not be sufficient for books, semester fees or for anything. We've to earn much more. Shall we run a Idli shop? - Fast foods! They will buy on credit, rowdies will also trouble us. We've to bribe the police. Do we need all this? Why don't we start a chit fund? Buddy, how about browsing centre, snow bowling... Look, he's starving but still trying to show off. Be practical. Hand made greetings, stuffed dolls, bouquet shops... Shall we start something like that? Hey, shall we start pickle business? You'll never give up that middle class mentality. Harini, I've an idea. Iyappan is the only way out for all this. Who's he? Is Iyappan your friend? - It's God. I saw when I was waiting on the temple stage. There was a cassette shop next to it. Lord Iyappan's cassettes were selling like hot cakes. 25 cassettes in half an hour. Devotees are just lapping up anything on Lord Iyappan. Shall we also start a cassette retail shop? No, let's release a Iyappan songs cassette. One cassette sells at Rs.30. After deducting our expenses, we can get Rs.15. Even if we sell 1000 cassettes, we can make Rs.15,000. Hey, you too have brain, boy. Information is wealth. But, who'll write the song? - Who else? Poet Munnasamy. Harini will sing. Munna too sings. We'll add “Samy' as chorus here & there. Juju, you are the key board player. Krishna, for a change you must be alive. Bob, you're the guitarist. How can 1? I learnt just to impress girls, that's all. Can I play up to the grade of releasing cassettes? Hey, the shoddy cassettes I had heard, I'm sure we can do much better than those. Song isn't important, devotion. Okay. Investment? We've one remedy for all our crisis, Mangalam sir. Any one interested to buy my bike? To release a devotional cassette, they've made me to walk. If they achieve success, that will be great. Mount...mount... Holy Sabarimala Mount. A mount thronged by millions of devotees. Where stones & thorns on the path are flower beds to the devotees. Stop it boys. You too dance with a turkey towel. You too have joined the bandwagon of film tunes. Think differently. Don't you want to think differently? Harini, sing this. Lord...lord...it's a day a new devotee is scaling the holy mount. It's too westernized. Make it Indian. Lord, it's a day a new devotee is scaling the holy mount. I'm a black shirt wearing theist. Harini, is the scale 57 - It's 6...okay Harini. Yes. Hey, don't rush, maintain the tempo. Our Lord Iyappa! It's a day a new devotee is scaling the holy mount. I'm a black shirt wearing theist. Son of King of... This holy mount is his abode. Our Lord Iyappa! Excellent! A lord who cured his mother's disease with tiger's milk. A merciful lord who gives bountiful to his faithful. We've come seeking refuge in you, Lord. Stones & thorns are a bed of flowers. Who's that? Who's that singing out of tune with the chorus? Hey, Spring haired boy, move away & sing. Give me the new devotional cassette on Iyappa by Boys. Give me also a Boys cassette. Come sir, listen to the devotional songs once. If you wear it once... You take in these 2 carriers. One for you and one for me...now go. I seek refuge in you, Lord Iyappa. Hey, get up every one. I was suspecting what's this noise every night from the motor room. I must beat Teju. Crooks! Get out. If you ever come back home, I'll break your limbs. You are married, aren't you? - Yes sir. Take your commission. Not just homes, I can arrange anything you name it. Can you arrange this girl for me? My slippers will get worn out. - You go, sister. Is it right to speak like this at this age? Go upstairs. Buddy! Fantastic place to enjoy drinks. Why do we traditionally boil milk in a new home? You can even brew spurious liquor. But, Police will arrest you. Didn't you both pay examination fees? Your names are in list of defaulters. Gone. If we don't pay before 10th, we can't take examinations. Whatever we had, we paid as advance for home. What to do now? Don't worry. There are 108 Goddesses. If we release one cassette for one Goddess. We can finish our studies. Goddess Mariamma! Come & bless me. Out...I said get out. A song apt for madam. - Silence. Thank you. Friend! Me? Your cassette on Iyappa was very good. Congratulations. Thanks.- Next? Goddess Mariamma. It's off season now. Oh! What about our fees then? We are planning to stage a social awakening drama. Can you compose a song for us? Will you pay for it? If we don't pay fee by 10th, they'll not allow us to take examinations. Who's refusing, tell me. Let's burn down the college. How much do you want? - Rs.50,000. Agreed.- Really? But the message must be revolutionary. What type of message? It must be like the poor questioning the rich, like general people questioning the Ministers. I can do it. - It must be hard hitting. Like your despotism will come down with our bullets? Only then the drama will be effective. - We can create wonder. Take the advance. Keep the song ready. We'll meet you in your house tonight. My address...No.18, Sivan koil... - I know. I'll take leave now. He has agreed. Ask Jeeva to keep Rs.50,000 ready. We'll meet them tonight. Is politics a refuge for criminals? Can tax money get scared with dangers? Can you get a free loin cloth hereafter? Will it be distributed in PDS? Fantastic comrade. It's spitting fire. Munna, isn't this line little strong? It'll behead the leaders. We'll not get into trouble, will we? Just words. He wants much stronger. Hear this. This group will never spare them... Are their heads fertilizer for this roots? This Govt. will be burnt down. A new political dawn will break. Our freedom is a question mark? Down with this government. Communal fanaticism is ruling roost here. Peace is down & beaten. Let's awake and unmask them. Communal violence has erupted. Non-violence is in distress. New generation will taken on head on with them. It will behead the poisonous politician. That's it. Let's go. Round up everyone. Down with despotism. Catch him. I'm not able to concentrate on studies. I'm into the mood always. Just a little bit of non-vegetarian. If you want, I'll follow safety measures. I am really excited. Please...please. Buddy, he's begging. We are married, I say. Okay, just for today. Let every one sleep. I'll go to the shop. Kumar, Police. Where's Jeeva?- Who is Jeeva? Who printed this pamphlet? Where have you hidden the rifles stolen from the police station? Are you printing counterfeit notes? Smuggling brown sugar?- No Heroin?- No Who are you? Suicide squad or RDX? Are you from PWG? Majumdar group?- No sir. Or from Narayana Reddy group? - No sir. I'm Nattukottai Chettair. Who wrote the lines about beheading leaders?- We wrote. Who wrote this Government will be reduced to ashes? Its me. Arrest them. We were paid for this like Iyappa cassette. We composed for them. We are in no way connected to them.- Shut up. We want to make a phone call to our friend Mangalam sir. We must consult our Lawyer Sampath. No lawyers, no explanations. You've been arrested under POTA act. Go this side. Come this side. Go. Go man...go. Come...come... Why are you looking back? Go. Pick pocket? Eve-teasing? Drug peddling? You look like young innocent boys. What did you do?- We sang a song. Did they arrest you for singing? Yes. Okay, sing a song for us. We are not in a mood to sing. Smoke this, your pain will go up in smoke with it. Pandian of Sowcarpet Cross wearing Peter. We dreamed of becoming another legendary Ambani. Now we are a group branded as criminals. Oh! Central Jail? Look at our plight. Oh Big, fat mosquito, don't bite my lover. She was like an angle, I've reduced her to jail bird. All I gave her is exile in the name of marriage. My heart is getting crushed like a lime under a road roller. A rose is writhing with pain lonely in a butcher's shop. Sir, where's the toilet? Enough of your bath. Come on get going. Is there water in the tank or not? Who took a bath now without leaving a drop of water? Go man. Come fast. Come in a queue. Don't you like it? Come. Come fast. 44,48, .51... You are wanted in the roll-call. Are you sleeping here? Get up...get up. What happened? Don't cry. You memories kept me alive, Harini. - I almost died without seeing you. Hey Krishna!- Mangalam sir. Where did you go away? They refused to tell me even the place you were. Bloody crooks! Only after the chief was arrested, court ordered your release finding you are not connected with them. That too after a great deal of pleas with Home Secretary. We don't have energy to say even thanks. First buy us a tea. Come. So many covers? All of us have got letters. As decided by the college management & the board, for having contacts with terrorists, for singing anti-national songs, we are forced to expel you from the college. Gone...everything is gone. She'll become a doctor, he'll become a fashion designer, he'll become an MBA graduate, we all dreamed of reaching the top with education. All our dreams are shattered. We had challenged our parents about succeeding in life. All our lives are ruined. Why are you lamenting like a house in mourning? We bore all these difficulties for our education. We did all odd jobs, sang, went to jail. Who told you that stopping your studies will close doors to the future. Education is the only career. There'll be a talent hidden inside every man. If you identify and work hard on it. You can make the world to turn back & see you. What talent do we have sir? You've music in you. Do you want us to go to jail again? Why do want to cut such albums? Cut a pop album. When everyone was dishing out the same creepy music. With good arrangements in your devotional cassette, putting percussions to good use, with good lyrics, you had made that album very interesting. That's why it topped the charts. You gave shivers to the Govt. with your revolutionary cassette. Youth & freshness is your plus point. Then, shall we cut an album tomorrow? We can cut a paper, not an album. You must work hard for it. You can't become a scholar overnight. First, let's meet Sony. I don't think Tamil Pop albums will sell. A few albums had an average sale of 5000 copies. In Hindi Dater Mehendi, Alisha Chinoy, Adnan Sami, Sukhwinder have good sale. That market is very huge. Don't say like that sir. If you decide, you can create market.- How? Any one is popular by singing in films? Did you compose music to any film? Listen to this Iyappan Devotional songs. These cheap road stuff will not do. Sony is an international company. If you've time, will you listen to one song? I don't have time for that...No. Sir please...- I'm sorry. Sir, please...- It's impossible. Please sir...please sir. Please sir...please sir. Please give us identity, sir. Please sir...please sir. Help us to make our dream come true. Can't our fingers beat a rhythm on the moon? Won't we create a musical typhoon when our fingers play on lightning? Hail Lord Rama/! We are birds singing light music. You are our sanctuary. Give it man.- Leave it. Leave it man. You said your grandpa died and... Give it. I have to go. Get out of my place. Watchman, come here...come here. Go out...go out. It's good shot. Hit fours, sixes & centuries. Go to the town. Boys of tomorrow are here. My salutations. Let's talk it with our music. Let's receive awards from Dr. Abdul Kalam. Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta. Let's charm with our music. London, Melbourne, Atlanta, will stand to applaud us. Hey Man, watch. We are an army. Break the old rules and jump the fence. Break the rules.- Oh yeah! They say it's wrong if we wear a earring. They say it's wrong if we dye our hair with colors. They say it's wrong if we tattoo our bodies. They say it's wrong if we go out with friends. They say it's wrong if we wear a ring on our navel. They say it's wrong if we wear tight pant. They say no to pedicure, Manicure, waxing & treading. They say it's wrong to drink rum. They say it's wrong to get up at 9 AM. They say it's wrong to laugh heartily. They say it's wrong to stretch our limbs. If we are complacent, they'll say anything. Break the rules.- Oh yeah! They say it's wrong to steal examination fee. They say it's wrong to play cricket during examination time. They say it's wrong to come home late. They say it's wrong to watch FTV. They say it's wrong if we admire Hrithik Roshan. They say it's wrong to gossip on phone. They say it's wrong to stand on the terrace. They say it's wrong to counter argue. They say it's wrong if we girls & boys meet. They say it's wrong if girls meet girls & boys meet boys also. They say it's wrong if we sit or stand. You've talent. Freshness in your voice. I like it very much. Particularly the girl's voice. I will give you a month's time. Come back with 10 songs composed with concept. If they are good, let's go for recording. Sign this agreement. Give them an advance of Rs.1,00,000.- Okay. Buddy, treat.- Shut up man. On whose name shall I make the cheque? Make it on Boys. Who are you?- Me? He's Manager of Boys troupe. Your name? I'm Mangalam...no Sundaram. Nice meeting you. Hi! All the best. What type of Album shall we do? Hip Hop Trans. Techno. Jungle beats, buddy. Bhangra. No, folk is the best. We can fill in with any word and say it's music. Don't create music. Transfer it from your life. Biriyani is ready. What's this all of a sudden? I'm going to break everything. Harini please? It's just Beer, it is just like butter milk. Shouldn't we celebrate the occasion? Just only once. You need a reason to drink. You'll drink even on festival days also. Harini, one half-boil please. - Please Harini. You will never reform. - Please, Harini. Cheers. Buddy, I'm very happy. We must share a drink like this together even achieving success. We must buy a 5-bed room flat & stay together. Forget about 5 bed room flat. Give me the account for the Rs.500 I gave you. I spent it on Beer & other things. What's the price of Beer, Munna? - Just Rs.60. 5 beers will be Rs.300. Rs.30 for eggs. Where's the balance of Rs.1707? Bisleri mixed in Beer costs Rs.170. You all are frauds. Where is the balance of Rs.300 after buying chicken? Come on tell her, she's asking account. I spent it. - How did you spend it? I forgot.- I will tell you. Trying to fix me. Literary expenses Rs.300. What's the Krishna? Are you so cheap? You are devastated for this. He has written sex stories with a central character Malgoa Aunty. Dirty fellow. He'll go to Ranganathan street in the evenings. He'll target aunties. What's this man? You are saying as if you all are saints. Didn't you all enjoy rubbing against women? Harini, we 5 go together. We ogle and caress together. Not only that we all together had sex with a girl. They are behaving as if they are saints.- Shut up. First it was me, next that guy, next he. Then, he.- Shut up. In his house only. What was her name? Wasn't it Rani? Hey, don't blabber.- Am I? Getting impressed with you, didn't she say it's free for you anytime. Krishna, you are going to get from me. Will you beat me for telling the truth? Didn't you do it 3 times? Eve if you beat me, I'll tell the truth. Are you trying to fix me? Come on, get up. Didn't she say your future wife is very lucky? Harini, Rani gave a certificate long back that you are lucky. Munna, stop. Is it true what Krishna has told? It's drunken blabber. Did you bring a girl to your home or not? Nothing had happened as you are thinking, Harini. Was it true or not?- It's true. But, I didn't commit any mistake. Why didn't you tell me about this earlier? Nothing happened then to tell you. You didn't have sex with her? I swear on you, no. Krishna said 3 times. Fearing they'll make fun of me, I lied. Don't lie. What did she say while leaving? She said my future wife is very lucky. You cheat. I hate you. She didn't mean in that sense. When I say truth now, it looks like a lie. I didn't even touch her finger also. Just played a drama. How beautifully you are lying! I left everything and followed you like a goat. Nothing of that sort had happened. I followed you where ever you took me. Sleeping on floor, eating whatever we got to eat, went to jail also. How could you hide such a big fraud? Get out. - No. You are also just like others. There's nothing special in it. You are a garbage. You are a pig. Street dog. Harini, don't go... Trust me. ...stop Harini. Don't touch me.- Harini stop. I didn't commit any mistake. Don't go Harini. The moment love broke. It's the moment it turned into a hell. Don't go, Harini. Heart is melting in fire. Why did you come back? Mother, please believe me. I'll never go back to him. I'll accept all your conditions. Please let me in, please. I have come back as I had left home. Why is it still in your neck? Throw it out & enter. Sorry Munna. I'm not a human at all. Scold me, beat me or throw me out from the running car. Go man. We are also at fault. We shouldn't have irritated you. We shouldn't have drank. We shouldn't have called Rani. Which Rani? Cat eyes, with a baby in arms. You too came with her to my house. Oh that group of tenements in Mambalam. I have forgotten her real name also. A new girl from Cuddapah has come. Are you interested? She's much better than her. We are not here for that. His wife has left him after knowing about Rani. But, they didn't commit any mistake. They can unite only if Rani comes and tell his wife the truth. We never keep any girl with us for more than 2 months. We change hands. Don't know who's her pimp now and where she might be now? Don't know where she might be Calcutta, Bombay, Dubai or joined politics? If you get any information about her. Contact me on my cell phone, okay? Okay sir. - Right. Sir, when will you come for that Cuddapah girl? I will...a family is broken here. And you are worried about Cuddapah girl. Leave me alone. Yes.- We want to meet Harini. He has dropped in from America at the right moment. Who is it, Harish?- Boys. Isn't he like a character coming on Zee T.V. Aunty, what had happened was... Enough of spoiling her life. She has thrown out the auspicious thread. It'll be some where there only. Pick it up & leave the place. Don't ever again interfere in her life. Aunty... please open the door. Harish, call the police. Are you playing fool? Such a big opportunity. You are behaving so irresponsibly. I offered you the contract for her voice only. There's a lilt & silken touch in that girl's voice. A magic is created when her voice joins these boys' voices. This contract stands if that girl sings. Or else return the advance money. I'll issue a notice. Jeni, next visitor.- Sir please... Sir please! Aunty, I'm Sampada speaking. Can you please give the phone to Harini? Did those bloody dogs ask you to make the call? Don't ever call again. She doesn't need your friendship any more. If you still try to call her... Please move. Where's our Kumar? Where's Kumar? Where is Kumar, sir? Look there, in the emergency ward. Who is the driver? - Look there, that man. What the hell are you driving? How could you run over our friend? Bloody, I will kill you. - Leave him. Why are you getting angry on the driver? Are we responsible if any one slips and falls traveling on foot board? He traveled on foot board chasing a girl. He moved forward yelling Rani. He slipped and his leg stuck into the tire, and you've come to beat the driver. Get lost. Kumar, what's this? What happened?- Look at us. Wake up boy. If you die, I'll kill you. Doctor, do something. Press him, inject something. Get up... Get up or else I'll beat you. Please Kumar... Oh God! My son... Where's he? What happened to him? His body is drenched in blood. What happened to you, son? Nothing has happened to him, isn't it? Isn't he fine? Nothing has happened to him, isn't it? What did the doctor say? Uncle, Kumar has left us. You have unjustly killed my son taking him along with you. I told you many times not to join this group. You never bothered to care. Did I give birth to you to see this day? Can you give back his life? You have unjustly killed my son for your better life. Harini, one minute. Do you know why Kumar died? He saw the prostitute traveling in that bus. He wanted to bring her to you to tell the truth, and wished to unite you with Munna. He traveled on the foot board & got crushed under the bus. You've seen, haven't you? Come, let's go. Is it the age to die, my son? They are taking away my son. No... We had committed a grave mistake. We should've followed our parents' advice. What did I achieve marrying after running away from home? Harini has left me. We've lost Kumar also. Why should I live now? I've not only spoiled my life, I've spoiled your lives too. I am a zero. You go back to your homes. I don't want to lose you too. That's all, curtains down. End card has been shown. Boys are greatest losers. Instead of talking a mad, it's better you kill us. All four of us will die. -3 of us. Hey Harini, come out. Come out, I say. Come out. Will you come out or not? What's happening? Who's that?- Hey, come out. Hey, move away.- Come out. Move away.- Come out. Why are you throwing stone? Go...go away. Don't throw stone. Our friends walked out of their homes for us. They stayed with us through difficulties for our sake only. Kumar lost his life to unite us. It isn't important whether we come together again or not. Atleast our friends must succeed. They must succeed in love & career. Their future hinges on the completion of this album. We must do something for all their help. Sing at least for them. Okay, Harini will sing for the last time. On one condition. Munna must put a signature. Divorce by mutual consent. What? Divorce by mutual consent. Sign at the places marked by an 'X'. She will come. Munna, stop.- Munna, don't sign it.- No way. No need, come let's go. Isn't there anyone else to replace her? Let's make Muniyamma to sing. Sir, my friends future is more important than my life. Munna, no. We don't need a future with a price. Let at least one good thing happen. I've been doing fine. Before we get to the actual show. Ladies & gentleman, the latest sensation. Boys from Chennai. - Here they are to sing. The secret of success. Say "Sa' Say 'Re' Say 'Ga" Say "'May' What? Think differently. That's what we say. Oh my god! Music. Think differently. That's what we say. It's a part of luck, loss & labour Add a part of devotion, hope & talent. All put together is secret of success. This is our own brand of music. It's music born in tortures. To be a star. We show you how. Reach for the skies. And never...never give it up. We'll freak it, just kick it. Pain is the secret of success. We are the Boys. Sitting on street corner walls & gossiping. It's a time of happy days, friend. Desiring for success at adolescent age, we failed miserably. We took the wrong route to find the right route. Mistakes are the secret of success. We ran away to discover this world. I realized to toil for her. Love is the secret of success. Here we come, here we coming' yeah we coming up with something and you know we are bringing it to number one. Full of fun and together coming it let faster, yeah you know we're number one. Will you get a chance often. Will it announce and come? Grab it... Seize the day. We fight, toil hard, lose... but I'm sure. Secret to success. Short cut to success. It's honesty...it's honesty only. Honesty is the secret of success. What a great song! Now, to present the next award...Hariharan. Best Album of the year. Secret of Success... Goes to Boys. Congrats. Congratulations. Best male singer goes to Munna... Congratulations boy. Best lyric writer Munna. Best female singer, Harini. Congrats.- Thanks. Bob Galy. - It's our Babu Kalyan. Best new group...Boys. The man behind these 9 awards is our friend Kumar. But, he's not alive to share these moments of joy & triumph. He was responsible for the formation the group Boys. His devotional songs cassette idea, grew up to cut an pop album. We wouldn't be here today, if he wasn't with us. Kumar, you are in our breath, you're in our music. You'll not die till this music is there. You live forever. You live in our hearts. We are there for Kumar's family. There's one more person in our life. Who found the hidden talent in us and made us to identify ourselves. His name other than our Manager Mangalam sir. We are not going to thank him. We don't want to thank and make him a stranger. He's our God father. We love you Mangalam sir. We love you forever. With half baked knowledge, and half hearted approach in writing poetry. Love made me to write good poetry. For every artist, his lover is the first audience. The move to impress her turns into creativity. I was nothing, my Harini turned me into a poet. I must thank her. Because, today she's my wife. Tomorrow ex-wife. Tomorrow we are going to get divorced. Munna, take divorce and come fast, I'll marry you. No need to marry. I'll become your concubine. Are you going to marry him after talking divorce?- Yeah. When are you getting married? - Tomorrow. Family court's main objective in India is not divorce. It's bringing together. This is the last chance given by law. Do you agree for the divorce? It's my mistake to call a prostitute. But, I didn't have any sex with her. And I don't want to justify my mistake. A mistake is a mistake. And if it deserves the punishment of divorce from my wife. I accept it with regret. What do you say? What had happened wasn't a marriage? It was a mistake committed without knowing it's seriousness. We wish their separation. My brother has come from America to marry her. And it's good for my daughter's future also. Who said that? Jeni, I think it's call from Canada, attend to it. I'll call you later. I'm getting another call. Hello, I'm not able to hear properly. Who's that on the line? Swiss madam. Missing dates? Consult a doctor immediately. Oh! You mean program dates. Don't worry, I'll take care. Let's give her another 6 months time. What's this Mr.Justice? You're stretching it. Both have signed the papers, haven't they? Grant them divorce. We have many commitments. Hordes of girls are waiting in queue. Look here, girls photos are flooding in e-mail from all over the world. Grant them divorce sir. I'll pass judgment after the recess. Attender, bring some water. You've got many girls photos from different places, Punjabi, Gujarati, Kashmiri, Singapore, London, America, Australia, Canada... You've got one from Pakistan also. Each one is as ravishing as the other. Select one quickly. Each one is competing against other to charm you. Look at her. Isn't she like Kareena from side angle? Look! This girl is good. She's young. And sexy too. I like this girl very much. Settle this one for me. I thought & you selected her. Super selection. You make an ideal couple. Made for each other. I'll ask her to send her horoscope on SMS immediately. Can't you smell something burning? Is it wire or wife? Hey, will you marry again? Do you need another girl? Bloody dog. Hey, why are you behaving like a possessed one?- Get lost man. Rascal, you got us married. Are you planning for another marriage? I'll kill you. You tell me, bloody dog. Do you want a young girl? Is she sexy? What's this? This is too much, behave yourself. This is a problem between me and my husband. Don't interfere. Show your power on your husband. Hey you! Harini...cool...control yourself. Harini, listen to me. Where are you running away? Stop...Listen to me. Where are you running away? Will you go for another girl? Ghost, devil, Pig. - What are they doing? They are desilting. This game of live. Mr.Judge is coming. Give way please. Harini, listen to me. Are they fighting here also? Then, granting them divorce is the best judgment. Sir, you've misunderstood them. This is different type of fighting. They are holding each other's hairs. Yes sir, out of love. Have they come together?- Yes. How?-Possessiveness. She left him on hearing some lady had sex with him. She has come back on learning he's looking for a new bride. To unite them at least in the final moments. I incited jealousy in her. It has worked out very well. Then, what about those photos? They are for replacing Harini as a singer. She got enraged thinking it's for marriage. To sing?- Yes, Harini. Listen. Did you contemplate on replacing me as the group's singer? You dog...you rascal... you cheat... Listen to me. Harini, leave me. Why are you pushing me down? Don't come near me. Get down, elephant. Go man... What sort of a kiss is this? They say adjournment isn't it? This is it.
