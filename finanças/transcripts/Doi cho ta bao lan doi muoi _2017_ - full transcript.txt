WEDDING When I was a kid, I always dreamt of having a romantic wedding with my prince charming. And finally, that day came. But... Hold on! Do you really want to marry a woman who pulls your pants down in front of the whole company? It's all your fault! You tormented me all these years. What I care about is that I lost a friend! That is more painful than losing anything in the world. Stop! Enough of all the accusations. I don't deserve your friendship. Let it be! We've been friends since we were toddlers. They cared about me and hung around with me all the time. But... I was really slow sometimes. We had four rings with an 'infinity' shape. One each, promising to be friends forever, never be apart. Besides, we had a secret base. This wooden house. Actually, Bich Chau's dad built it for her so that she could play around in it. But then, she let us join her. Ah, who is Bich Chau? I forgot to introduce you. This is Bich Chau; the non-stop dancing girl. Bich Chau, 25 years old, our sugar mommy. She belongs to the legendary "Rich kids" gang. Big house, important dad. Her dream is to go swimming everywhere but she can't swim. People always think that Chau is a model but actually, she's not that tall... Only her assets are infinite. She's now managing her family's chandelier business. She's our financial supporter. She's also the one who comes up with the most brilliant ideas but most of her ideas are not doable. Chau has a very supportive right-hand man, and also a left-hand one. Sometimes even legs. Basically, when she's with Khang; her assistant and also boyfriend, she doesn't need hands or legs. This is Lan Anh, our leader. She's brave, quirky and majestic at the same time. She loves rock. She dreams of being a tattoo artist. But after she failed a tattoo design contest, she's become a librarian as her mother wished. This is Hoang, Lan Anh's boyfriend. He's very good to her. She always complains about him, but I find him pretty okay. That's why I need you. What else do I need you for? Uhm... I can read you a poem. LAN ANH'S BOYFRIEND POET, DAYDREAMER, CHEESY You're like a butterfly at noon. Gracefully flapping... to my heart. Please, just stop! This is Tan, the only man in our group. He's straight, likes the color pink and loves barbie dolls. Tan has a regret... that he lost his most favorite doll. PINK DOLLS He's now the manager of a doll store that he inherited from his mom. And this is his girlfriend, Quyen, a female scientist. Tan! I heard that you cancelled this order? She likes making bombs, and really loves Tan. Tan always said that it would be better if she wasn't interested in bombs. This is one of the most unique dolls. I won't sell it. Let me tell you something. If you keep doing this, there won't be any customers. I think you should turn this place into a showroom instead of a store. Don't worry! Nobody can resist the stuff in my shop. It's not going to fail. Finally, this is me, My Phuong. I love Lam Truong and hate scallops. I have no family, so they are my everything. I'll do whatever they say. That's friendship. I ended up tearing my dress once because of them. They bowed down to me then. Also, that time Lan Anh tore an arm of my teddy bear apart She said that was cool. I trusted her completely, so all of my teddy bears had only one arm left. I don't know why whenever I liked someone, I would fall and pull their pants down. I like red the most. They said wearing two pairs of red panties would bring me luck. With this lucky charm, I decided to confess my love to... my handsome boss, Hoang Tu MY PHUONG'S BOSS HANDSOME, SUPER COOL I've had bad luck my whole life! Because you're clumsy. Moreover, you're so obsessed with guys. Are you... Are you truly my best friends? Don't cry. Don't cry. Stop teasing, Phuong! Poor her! Why am I not feeling anything? -Her face is so funny. -Agree! You girls, please stop! You shouldn't do that. Phuong has been our best friend since we were kids. We have to support her, help her and embrace her! Why do you tease her? Poor her! Okay, okay, I surrender. Okay... Phuong, tell us the rest. Look at her! After that, I had to pack up and leave, -while my colleagues -She's out of her mind! were talking behind my back. I couldn't even look at him afterwards! Tell me! Why did you guys prompt me to do that? Boss is here! There's something called the "young lady curse"... It's about 100 rejections. What do you mean? According to the "young lady curse," if someone has her love rejected 100 times, she will be alone forever. Really? Really? Yes. That story is in the Young Lady Curse book. -Tenth floor, fifth shelf, then... -I listened to you guys! I wore two pairs of panties! What? Did we tell you to wear two? -Yes! -Don't tell me... that you're wearing two pairs of red panties now? Of course! You don't believe me? Here, I will show you! No! No! It's okay. Leave them there, don't take them out, okay? It only works when you leave them there. You're so dumb, listening to Chau. Because Chau often picks on Phuong. I just wanted to prank her. You guys made fun of the love of my life. BOSS: ARE YOU CRAZY? Oh my God! What did I do? I LOVE YOU! I LOVE YOU! I LOVE YOU! I lost my job. I lost my face. Best friends are useless! And I even got the forever alone curse. Dear God, am I that unlucky? Phuong... Is she dead? Is it because of the curse I mentioned? Are you crazy? Why did she go for a walk at noon and get struck by lightning? What are you doing? Why are you so dumb? Stop overreacting! It was just a lightning hit! That was the biggest lightning in the last 50 years! You're dumb too. What do we do now? We don't know if she's dead or not. Phuong. Silence! Please calm down guys! Although this is a tough case, she's still lucky... The patient is now in a deep coma but she will recover very soon. However... we need to do something on her face, so you guys can recognize each other. If you are her family, please read this carefully. And sign here for us. It's fine now. Silent! Do not make any noise! All you have to do is to keep talking to her. To stimulate her brain. Why? To speed up her recovery. Understand? Understand? Understand? Under... Hey! How are you today? How do you feel? I brought flowers to make you look better. You look so pathetic laying down like this. I will protect you more. I'm sorry. When we were five, I... I accidentally used the dirty cloth to wash your face. When we were ten, I gave you the wrong answers for Math. I will not let you be disadvantaged. Smile at me, Phuong. Hello? -When? -This morning. Who is this? Stop? Close your eyes guys! Look carefully! Two, three! She's Phuong? Why is she so beautiful? There's something wrong with her face, right? I think she looks a little bit dull. I told you that it'd be hard to recognize her. I never say the wrong thing. She's very lucky having good friends like you guys. Let me see. Face plastic surgery: Broken cheekbone, broken chin, whole face burnt. Total expense is 725 million VND. 200 million prepaid. There's still 525 million due, you want to pay in cash or by bank transfer? 525 million Dong? Why is it so much? Wait! Why did you do that without our permission? Calm down! Here! Look at it carefully! These are your signatures! You signed while you were crying and making such a hullabaloo! So weird. There's nothing weird here because that's the truth. But don't worry, life is very fair. It's not just you guys who can't recognize her, she can't recognize you either. You mean My Phuong lost her memory? Yes. Reverse memory loss caused by a hard crash during a lightning hit. But don't worry, what is lost can fully recover. You can remind her of some impressive stories and she will get her memory back faster. Who are you guys? My Phuong. Do you know me? I'm Thanh Tan. This is Bich Chau. That's Lan Anh. We've been best friends since childhood. We also have the same rings. This is mine, Bich Chau's, Lan Anh's and this is yours. Here you go. Do you recognize it? I don't understand. You don't understand? Let me say it again. You remember now, right? Here! Remember this dress? This is your favorite dress. I have never seen a ragged dress like this before in my life. You still keep it, which means you really like it. Why does this dress have such a big rip? This is because it got stuck when you jumped over the fence as a kid. I did something that dangerous? -It was Bich Chau-- -Hey! In the past, you were very clumsy. You used to do things like that. This bear is so lovely. -Get it! -This? -Yes. -Here, take it. It only has one arm? It has one arm because Lan Anh-- Life is very impermanent. What's lost is found and what's found is lost. Easy. You got it? Okay. Come here. I'm sure you will remember this. Look at this picture. We took this picture when we took you to ask to assist Lam Truong. Lam Truong! Lam Truong! Lam Truong! Are you okay, kid? I... I... What's your name? My name is... My Phuong. My friend wants to be your assistant. So we came here to... I agree, but it would be better if you wait for a few years. This will suit you more when you're an adult. -Do you agree? -Yes. Should we take a picture now? -Yay, yay! -Take a picture for us. Come here. Remember? Is it true that this is my house? Of course. Why do I feel so strange? I think we have to remind her of something more impressive. I got this! -That ultimate event! -Wow! What is that? The rare time that you took a guy home. -When? -Really? That time... Don't look at her, close your eyes. Step aside, let me see it. I don't see anything. You are a very special girl! Let me see, I can't see anything. -Step aside! -Let me see! Why are you here? It's still funny even now. Remember now? -You were mad at us for nearly a month. -She's so extra! -Hey, she remembers it. -Do you? I... I used to come here, right? Yes, we used to meet up here when we were kids. This is where we made our toughest decisions. -And all the plans-- -Just stop! Stop talking about your plans! It's so annoying! -You... -Let's go. What are you doing? These four dolls represent the four of us. So cute! This is... That is our wish box. Look at this! I want to open a tattoo store. I want to open thousands of Pink Homes across the country. I'm going to travel to every ocean in the world. You don't have the money? Really? I'm the one who paid for your plastic surgery. My hundreds of millions of VND are on your face! So... It's because I almost drowned one time, so I'm a little scared. "I want to open a tattoo shop." Are you also... No! It's just... I'm not that skillful. What is Pink Home? Pink Home contains the beautiful pieces of our childhood, the wishes of our youth, the memories of families. It is a doll store. You don't have enough money or lack of skills? No. Actually... Even my most beloved doll... I couldn't keep it. A dog dragged it away. So how can I manage thousands of dolls? "I want to have a true love, get married and then have babies." I used to be on the shelf? No, no, no! -Because you were-- -Unlucky! -I figured it out! -Same here. You have another plan? Keep it! No! I mean, I know how to get My Phuong's memory back. How? Let's take a look! Before she lost her memory, what was the most important thing for her? -Food? -Bullshit! So what was it? It was a man! More exactly, it was love! Just think! From then till now, she cared most about love. But she also failed the most at love. That's why... If we help her to get over that fear of love in the past, maybe she will remember everything. Are you sure? What a long and complicated way to say that! Because my genius mind is beyond all the simple things. Oh, my god! All of them are married, some even have babies. What are you doing, Tan? I'm looking at 99 guys who refused Phuong to help her get over her broken heart. This is when she got hurt by her most handsome boyfriend. What about this time? Not long ago. That's when she got rejected by every strange guy she confessed to but she kept trying to ask a new one out. Result? She starved herself for several days. So tragic! Another time, she got refused by a guy selling sponge cakes. But everyone's married now. There's just one guy who hasn't got a wife... He has a boyfriend. So bad! So... We have to try every single way we can, right? If we decide to do that... we won't have to look far. He's right in front of our eyes, has brand new pain and he's still single. But I don't know if he has a boyfriend or a girlfriend. -Hoang Tu? -Bingo! Who is Hoang Tu? He's the one whose pants were recently pulled down by... With whom you confessed, but failed. He's your handsome boss. HOW TO CHASE HOANG TU Done! In short, you have to be gorgeous every time you show up. That's not a hard thing to do now. Right! Thanks to my money. What we have to do now is to get her job back. It's so easy! Phuong's very smart. Just apply and she'll pass. Do I have to do all of this? Of course! You have to believe me! I will make your memory come back. Plus, we will get you the handsome boss. To make up for your days of being picked on by us. Listen to us if you want to succeed. Step one, first impression. Of course, beauty. Enter the company with pride and confidence. To draw attention, you should-- Yes. Trip lightly, then turn around, smile, and keep going. Who is that girl, Ms. Loan? Ah... She's the new employee. She got a big contract within a week at our company. Her name is My Phuong. My Phuong? Step two, prove yourself. Use all knowledge and skills which have never been used before. Especially, always look busy. From job to job, contract after contract. However, just one message from the boss can get you show up immediately. Help me! We're here. Why was I summoned here while I was gaming at home? And I was at work. What do you need me for? -What happened? -Here. God! Hey! I've got an idea! Where are the documents? You're here with no documents? Ma'am, here they are. Hurry up, it's late! -I'm brilliant, right? -Yes. Yes. The most important thing is, if the boss is a straight man, he will look back and smile at you. THE GIRL OF CEO REVEALED All will be successful, thanks to me. I remember someone said my plans were bullshit. But did My Phuong remember anything? Right, Phuong! Have you remembered anything yet? What? Not yet? Take it easy. It's just the first step. So what are we going to do next? Our next step is... We are going to make Hoang Tu confess his love to My Phuong. -Yeah! -Let me see! Not as beautiful as me. I think we should give her a makeover. Makeover? We're the ones needing a makeover. I agree! Like this morning... We had to deliver her documents from place to place in the hot weather. A dog chased me and I almost got bitten. She always has to look gorgeous. How can she go outside to deliver those documents, right? We have to help her because we're good friends. When she's finally succeeded, we will make her pay for that. How about... just ignoring me! I feel like I wasn't so good in the past, it's okay to remember nothing. Seeing you guys this miserable is so uncomfortable. I don't need it. Hey, hey, stay right there! What are you talking about? We must get your memory back. That's all we have to do. And I can't get used to your new look. These two always live an easy life -letting them suffer a bit is okay, right? -No. You, get away! What a "good" friend! Hey, turn around! Time for makeover! Let's check the face! Great surgery. Check the lower parts! At least they're still... The same. You're good! Look at yours! Same! Why don't you ask me out? Are you free later? Nope. Hello! Ah, okay! I've booked two tickets. Let's see it today! Really? Hello Of course, I'm free. On my way. Wait a sec! Hello? You stay here. I have to go. See you later! I have to say My Phuong looks so stylish these days. Even more than me. Ha ha, come on. Who made her like this? I come with you guys all the time and am starting to look feminine like you guys. Should we have different nail colors to be more stylish? I'll have red nails. Hey guys, Why...? She remembers.... She likes red. Every time we hang around together like this I miss our childhood so much. Yeah, me too. I miss it every day. What was I like as a child? Back then, you were... very stubborn and fierce. We had to listen to you all the time. Hey, are you sure? She was-- Stubborn. Fierce. Ah, yeah! You were our leader. I don't need to know how I look now. I just need you to stand by me forever, that's enough. It doesn't matter if you remember or not. The most important thing is we're friends, forever friends. Our friendship is infinite like our rings. But I think it's just a part of your brain being out of battery. Actually, in your subconscious, you always have us. Of course! The delay will affect our company, don't you know? I don't care. I want your contract within two days. Understand? Okay. -Are you blind? -Sorry, boss. You hit her but not even a sorry. And you blame her? Do you think you're God? You have nothing to say? Don't think that I didn't notice stuff when I was on the phone. I'm... sorry for what I said yesterday. But... Go on! Maybe it was just an act of anger for you, but someone may have gotten hurt. Let's dress up for Phuong's company party! Phuong! -That looks nice! -Ooh! So beautiful! Not bad! You seem over excited for a plus one! All she is today is thanks to me, okay? Thanks to me also! Let try it on! The dress you're wearing looks... good on you. Just that? I... I don't know... how to compliment a beautiful girl. But... I will try! I want you to meet someone tomorrow. Hi, grandma! I just got home! I thought you didn't like this shabby house and no longer wanted to come back? Come on, don't tease me, grandma! Let me introduce you, this is my girlfriend! Step three: Get close to his relatives. The boss has a powerful, yet picky grandmother, but she has a weakness, which is her puppy. If you want to reach her, you only need to help her find the dog if it goes astray. Oh, my god! -Good choice! Lovely! -Hi grandma! Hello, sweetheart! You're so gorgeous! Can you make me as beautiful as you please? Bich Chau didn't say anything about this girl. You're beautiful enough! Not that! She thinks that her parents left her because she's not pretty. Poor little girl! Please sit here, grandma! Grandma! Who's that little girl? She is Tu's daughter. What? Oh, my god! Ha ha, you're pretty but so easy to fool. I'm just kidding! It was in a charity trip to some charity school... You know? Orphanage. I saw her there. It was like an instant bond. She's never started a conversation with anyone. She likes you! It's okay. It's just me! I'm Phuong. Are you okay? Get up! Can you be my friend? Ta da! You girls are so close, huh? We're friends. Thank you for embracing her. Because I know what it means to be alone. I see myself in her sometimes. Trying to do everything so that my parents will show up. I want to thank you for everything. Don't go anywhere! Cheers! Let's celebrate because My Phuong is not single anymore! Congratulations! Our Phuong... is the happiest girl in the world now! She found her true love! Totally different from the last times. She broke the "young lady curse"! But... what a pity! Still remember nothing? Don't worry, there's still me! Take it easy! She's about to remember. Get over it! What's important today is we have to give it all! -Cheer-- -Stop! Stop cheering! My hand's tired. Just drink! It's just a cheers. Why so difficult? I'm sorry for letting you down. I really don't want to. But... I'm happy now, I truly am. I'm totally joyful! You know what? Seeing you happy is making me happy too. I've never seen you happy like this. Good for you. Is that a happy face? -Yes. Happy. I'm happy, very happy. -Oh God! What about your love life? Don't you know that Tan is still waiting for his prince charming? Hey, that's ridiculous! I may not look it but I'm 100% straight! -I love princess too. -Unbelievable! But my princess is just busy making bombs and dynamite. Explosions everywhere! Maybe you guys are not afraid but I'm tired of it! Of all the men in the world Tan is the only one who cares about poems and bow ties? I think if I ever marry him, I don't know who'll be the husband. Probably me. I can't stand it like this, I'm so bored Stop! Don't mention it. Drink! Come on, your girlfriend is still so good. My boyfriend is... My boyfriend is just like a girl. He says 'yes' to everything, does everything I tell him to. He might even turn himself into a chair if I ask him to. What kind of man is that? A man... has to be strong. He needs his own opinions. Hello! Hi, babe! Why did you ask me out? You still think... I don't have my own opinions? I don't deserve to be your man. Why? I realized... the man you need is not me. What? Becoming a scientist... is my biggest dream. If you cannot accept that, I don't want to force you. So... It's best for both of us... Let's break up! Let's break up! Let's break up! How can three of us get dumped at the same time? Exactly. It's so weird. Let's think back... When did you guys say that? And in front of whom? That's impossible. I also hope it's just a wild guess. Don't you see since we took Phuong home from the hospital she's become so strange? It seems like in the past I wasn't that good. It's okay to remember nothing. I'll have red nails. If she's pretending to lose her memory and cheating on me, I'll tell Hoang Tu everything about her. Let's see how she handles that. We're so kind to her. Stop being so aggressive! It's all just wild speculation. Tan's right! It's just a wild guess. To see if it's true or not, we'll have to do something. What are you guys talking about? -We're saying that-- -Nothing! Hey, as we're all here. Let's go traveling. Travel? Yes. We haven't gone anywhere for a long time. Let's go! Go traveling. What is it, grandma? This is what you call traveling? You didn't read Lan Anh's text, did you? We're backpacking. That's it. Be careful! Two, three! Oh, my God! What the heck? -Unbelievable! -Are you out of your mind? Your style's still the same although you've lost your memory. It's beautiful! What are you wearing? What is it? A T-shirt. Why are you wearing a T-shirt inside your swimsuit? Because it shows off my belly. -Oh, God! -You're too much! I think you should go back to your room. We'll go alone. Hey! -Where are you going? -What are you doing? Are you crazy? It's horrible! You can't wear like this! -You! Make her change the outfits! -Okay! Let's change your clothes! So terrible! Let's go swimming! No! Put me down! Stop! She's afraid of water. My Phuong? You remember something, right? How do you know that? Uhm... She told me when we were in the treehouse. No! Stop it! Hi, everyone! Where did you come from? Why are you here? I miss you! Cheers! We must drink hard tonight because it's our last night in this love beach. And we have to congratulate My Phuong. She's getting married real soon, right? Cheers! How about you guys? He's gone! I let him go! Who am I? He said we were so different then he broke up with me. I'm the worst! I feel like I don't deserve anyone. Maybe it is better... better for her. Stop it! Eat, Phuong! Your favorite food! Medium rare scallops. Are you guys not eating? See that? You're so cruel! Why did you do that? She was always allergic to scallops. Why did you guys force her to eat all those foods? You tried everything that she's scared of. I don't think that she's pretending. Even if she's pretending... for a long time she's had to suffer a lot. The fact that she's now happy and beautiful, we can accept it, can't we? -Hi, miss, please follow me. -Phuong! Phuong! I'll take care of your purse. Just enjoy, okay? Phuong, try to enjoy it before you're a beautiful bride. I'll go now. Admittedly, My Phuong looks more beautiful day by day. She's totally different. Nothing like before. That's good for her. It's her phone. Pick it up! It must be Tu. -Right? -Hello It's Tan. Phuong's gone to the spa. No, you can't. The groom cannot see the bride today. You're not allowed to see her. Okay, I got it. Okay. What did he say? Hey! Stop! -Give it to me. -Why? -For what? -Just give me. Let me see... If they have any hot pics or videos? You're becoming increasingly perverted every day, Bich Chau. So then, don't look at it, okay? Okay... Promise? Oh! A lot of selfies. Oh, God. There's kissing photos. Why take photos while kissing? Let's see if there's videos. Oh, God! Here! Hey! SECRET FILE -What's that? -"Secret file"? We shouldn't see it, right? Let's ignore it! Oops, I just clicked it open. Want to see? But my princess... My princess is just busy making bombs and dynamite. Maybe you guys are not afraid but I'm tired of it! Talking about feminine, nobody can beat Hoang. Hey! Do not do anything stupid! -What do you mean? -Uhm... because... No matter what, she's going to get married tomorrow. No matter what... She's suffered a lot since she was a kid. -No matter what... -Stop! Your "no matter what" is annoying me! Okay! I won't tell Hoang Tu. I really love her. No matter what happened, I won't-- Especially you! Don't go and ruin her wedding! Who said I'd ruin her wedding? I don't care. Promise? Not a problem. I promise! I promise I won't ruin her wedding or destroy it, okay? Why are you looking at me? Okay, I promise! I won't tell Tu anything, okay? Okay, tomorrow, I'll give her another chance. If I don't say anything, I am not Bich Chau anymore! How can you take advantage of my intelligence? Can I keep calm tomorrow? What are you doing? It's late. Why are you still standing there? No way! It's my lucky charm! What are you looking for? Tell us then we'll help you. The red panties. Why did you put them here? Don't you know that I've been looking for them? Are you...? Let me tell you this. My Phuong is a liar. She lied to me. She lied to you. She had plastic surgery. You! You can't marry that kind of girl. It's time to go. Special thanks to the family of both bride and groom for being here today to bless our bride and groom. Stop! I have something to say. I'm sorry. I won't marry you. What did you say? You guys have something to say to me, right? Of course! I have something to say to the bride... who is also the best friend that we shared our childhood with. She's the one we loved the most. The one I'm willing to sacrifice everything for. And she's also the one... who has been lying to us the whole time. She's the one who stabbed us in the back. I helped her to find her love. How can you be this cruel to us? Can you settle this later? We're helping you. Helping me? Do you really want to marry a woman who pulled your pants down in front of the whole company? What did you say? That My Phuong and this My Phuong are the same person. She had plastic surgery. Didn't she tell you that? I don't care if you're ugly or beautiful. I don't care if you treated us badly. Do you know what I really care about? All I care about is that I just lost a best friend. That is even more painful than losing anything else in the world. We're sorry that... we made fun of you sometimes. But don't you... don't you feel our love for you? You blamed me for lying? You think you're better than me? What you did to each other... Do you dare to tell? During my time in hospital, I heard a lot of interesting things. I really regret it. You won't tell him, will you? I know you're a good girl. You told me all the bad things you did to me but never dared to say to my face. Say it! Admit that you're the one who stole Tan's doll and let the dog drag it away. What? You can't admit that? Was it you who made me blame myself for all those years? Stop playing the victim! Who was the one that made Lan Anh fail the tattoo design contest? She doesn't even dare to walk out of that stupid library to follow her dream? Why does it have anything to do with Tan? I'm sorry. I took your painting out to see it and tore it apart by mistake. I drew another one and put it back. -You? -And who was the one that made Bich Chau almost drown, which makes her now scared of even water in the pool? That wasn't an accident? I was just.... I didn't mean to... I just wanted to tease you. Teasing? Yes. I had plastic surgery. I pretended that I lost my memory. I sent the file to your lovers. So what? You obviously said that you didn't need them. You didn't even need the ones who love you the most. I was just helping you to get rid of who you think didn't deserve you. As for me... I've always walked behind you, been made fun of, had to do everything you said. That's enough! You were always handsome and beautiful, happy and loved. How could you know what I felt? Okay! This outburst is enough! I don't deserve your friendship. Let it be! Phuong! You're not like that. I'm sorry... I'm still as ugly as before. Please go! After everything was brought to light, I realized that those misunderstandings were just so minor. There is something that you can't get back after losing it. I hear that Lan Anh is strong enough to live as her true self and make her of being a tattoo artist come true. Thanh Tan is opening more and more Pink Home stores. He's getting more into his business. He has finally overcome his obsession with the lost doll. Bich Chau is no longer relying on Khang. She's used her wisdom in the development of her company. All of us seem to have found out who we really were and we tell ourselves that we are still fine without friends. Until one day, we get an invitation to a crossroads. None of us know where we are heading to, but I know we all keep hope inside. Tan, say it! Start now. How can you let a man talk first? I don't know what to say! Oh, God! -Just say it. -I'm nervous. -Bich Chau, you first. -No! You! -You're talking the most! -Okay, let me begin. What was that? Someone just suddenly got married. It's a good thing. Why are you crying? I'm not! I think that from now, every time we go drinking together there won't be all four of us. We have to split the bill three ways. Each of us has to pay more. But they usually make me pay all of it. Because you're rich. Promise me... Promise me that you will never forget us again. And thank you... for giving me an honored position. Although it's so wrong, but thank you for letting me be your bridesmaid. I told you that if you were still single at 30 I would marry you. But you're going to marry long before that. -Say! -Be my witness. There are only two left. If they're still single at 30, I'll marry them both. -Oh dear! -Stop! I don't need you! Okay. Now is your turn. I... I love all of you. But I love you most. Because you're the most pathetic girl. I'll cry If I say anything else. -I can't say anymore. -I think that's enough. -It's enough. -Cut this scene, please. You have to let us watch it back. If you can, just cut it. I made this video to surprise you on our wedding day. Unfortunately, it couldn't be aired that day. This is the video I recorded of you. My life has... no family, not any siblings. I'm very lucky to have you as best friends. I always imagine and wish that someday, when we get old, we'll feed each other, and scrub each other's backs. Staying together until we lose all our teeth. But I'm really afraid that one day... we'll no longer stay with each other. I think, no matter how everything changes, even if I change, I'll never forget all of you. If we have a next life, I think, I'm willing to exchange anything to have this friendship again. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Sorry, you guys! I'm sorry. Friendship is like other kinds of relationship. There will be ups and downs. There will be times that you love them and times that you hate them. But every time we feel like that, just think of the time you've spent together. Everybody has to go through the feeling of losing a best friend, right? Nobody loves or hates anybody forever. Later when we get older, memory is the thing that always remains. So, if you're still mad at your friend... just call them and tell them sorry. Apologize for allowing you to become like that. Apologizing means really embracing the relationship. There aren't any perfect relationships! Just never let go of our hands, no matter what happens. And what we need is to keep our promise to stay together, never be apart, isn't it? That's my story... a girl who totally fails in life. My only success is that I've spent my youth with the friends that I love the most.
