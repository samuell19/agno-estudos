TIME TO LOVE Screenplay Director of Photography - I'm glad you thought about coming to the Island, Meral. We'll have a beautiful weekend. - I like the Island in Fall. - Do you have a security guard at your place? - No, we don't. - I think there's someone in the house. - Strange. I don't get it. It's not possible. - I'm afraid to go and look. I won't leave here. - Me neither. - I'll do it then. - I'm no burglar. - What are you doing here? - Nothing. - How often do you come here? - Everyday. It's been a year. - So, what do you do here? - Do you want to leave? - Yes. - I have friends downstairs. I assume you don't want to be seen. - Yes. - You may leave if you want. I have one more question. Who are you? What do you do? - I'm a house painter. I decorate houses. I'm working in Mr. Ahmet's manor now. Last year we worked here. - Allright, you may go if you want to. - So you saw the girl on the picture at last. Is she as beautiful as in her picture? - She is indeed. Much beautiful than her picture. What's gonna happen next? You cannot go there comfortably anymore. - You don't think they will spend the whole winter here, Will they? - She discovered that you're in love with her picture, didn't she? - May be she did, I don't know. - (Ovid - The Art of Love) - Welcome. you must be Miss Meral. - I'm looking for Halil. - He went to the market to buy couple of things. Today we're going to have our lunch here. He'll be here in a minute. - Nice colors you've picked. - We also did interior decoration for your place. That's when he fell in love with your picture. - He fell in love with my picture? How do you possibly fall in love with a picture? Is there anyone Who can fall in love with a picture nowadays? - It's like in fairy tales. Look missy. I say things only once. Things that I truly believe in. Halil fell in love with you a year ago. Madly in love. I bet he's going to the greenhouse. - Why do you go and watch my picture for months? Aren't you gonna answer me? Or do you afraid of telling the truth? - Whatever you wanna know, I'm sure Mustafa told you already. - I want you to say it. I have a right to know something that relates me, I suppose. - No, it does not relate you, at all. What's between me and your picture is none of your business. I'm in love with your picture. - Yes but it is MY picture that you're in love with. So here I am. I'm here to listen to what you'll say. - You're not your picture. It belongs to my world. I know your picture, not you. Perhaps you'll destroy all of my good thoughts. - Your behaviours are based on a certain fear. - Yes they are. It is a fear I bear in order to keep what I love, forever. What would have happened if I was in love with you instead of your picture? Possibly you wouldn't have looked at me, not even once. Perhaps you'd have made fun of my love. But your picture... It looks friendly at me. With kindness. So it will forever. - I want to look at you too. - No, do not step in between me and your picture. I don't want you. I'm in love with your picture only. - You didn't hear me coming, just like the first day. I wouldn't wanna disturn you again, but I couldn't help it. I want to talk to you for a while. But show some understanding this time. Hey let's not talk here, let's go out. - I though you wouldn't come back after you brought the picture. - I wasn't going to. I wasn't but you see it didn't work. - A relationship of two people is a good thing. - Why do you avoid relationships that transcend friendship? - If you mean "love", I'll say nothing in this world is able to transcend friendship. - Then your feelings for me are beyond love. - No, I'm not in love with you. - Nonsense, being in love with my picture is being in love with me. I've been thinking of what you've said. You are afraid of confessing your love to me. - How can I possible confess something that does not exist? Why don't you want to understand? I'm in love with your picture and that's it. - You loved my picture on my absence. Here I am now. I am the essence of that picture. From now on, we will share this love with each other. Half of it belongs to me. - Do you think it's so easy to build a friendship, to preserve it? I've spent a long time with your picture. I remember our first day as if it was yesterday. Suddenly I saw a face, staring at me with kindness, with love. My clothes were shappy, I was dirty, my beard was long. I couldn't believe it. I was afraid to look again, in case I might not find that humane look this time. Hardly I looked at it for the second time. There was still kindness and love in your eyes. At last, I've found my constant. Your picture was looking right through me, seeing myself within me. We spent cold winter nights together in that empty manor. It kept on looking at me with love and kindness. Many times I touched its face, kissed its eyes, fondled its hair. - There is love in my eyes too. I, as well, see yourself within you. From now on, I am going to love you. It's me now. - No, no I don't want you. Do not get into my life. You'd destroy it mercilessly. Your picture is a part of me, let me love it only. Don't love me. I don't want to hold your hands. You'd take them away from me. I love your picture! and I will, until I die! - Even YOU don't understand me, how could a stranger like her do? - First of all, don't call her a stranger. She's the person you're in love with. As for me not understanding you, I'd say you're completely wrong about this issue. That's what I know, that's what I say. - Did I ask her to come that day? If she hadn't caught me staring at her picture, she wouldn't have known I exist today. No, I don't love her. I love her picture. I couldn't make her understand that; and now you don't get it either. - Very well, but is she to blame just because she caught you staring at her picture? Then you shouldn't have fallen in love with her picture. Since she knows everything now and wants to share this love with you, you're bound to do that. - How can I share something that doesn't belong to her? My love belongs to me only, it's mine. - You're wrong. This isn't right. This is egoistic. You should go at once and apologize to her. - I don't apologize to anyone. - Suit yourself. However, you can't treat her that way just because she returned your love. I, Mustafa the Dervish, cannot ascribe such a behavior to my friend. - "I always thought that people cannot fall in love for real. Your passion for my picture destroyed my beliefs. Now I'm in love with you. It's the only thing I could do for the extent of your love. Perhaps I was living behind my picture. But you didn't try to see me at all. But whether you want it or not, I exist, Halil. I am the girl in that picture and I love you. You taught me how to be alone and brave in love. Hereafter, I will do my best to be like you." - So that's the whole story Basar. After all, I'm in love too. - How can you say these things to me? How can you tell me that you love another man? Am I not the man you love? - No you're not Basar. We were close but I never told you that I love you. - May be you don't love me, but still we had a relationship. For the sake of that, you shouldn't have told me that. - So you want me to deceive you? I can't do such thing. I say the truth directly. - You're still under the influence of what happened on the Island. Falling in love with a picture is a good trick indeed. That's why you're like that. Don't be a child Meral. You cannot love a man like him. He's not your class. - Actually he is the human to be loved, Basar. But Halil isn't aware of my love. To him, I hardly exist. - You are contaminated by this madness. Listen, let's spend some time together for couple of days, then you'll forget that man. - I cannot forget Halil, Basar. He's not a man like that. - You'll never know. Just stick with me and you'll see. Shake off your pain, and then we'll talk it over. - Let's see if we're gonna like our new working place. Good times on the Island are gone now. Every job I finish makes me sad, Halil. The pain after a lost relationship falls down on me like poison. And that's exactly how I feel after I complete a job. Find that girl, Halil; or you'll suffer a lot. To me you are a bad person Halil and you will be, unless you seek for her. - I'd like to see Miss Meral. - Missy is not home, she went out with her friends. - Where did she go? - I guess they went to the Shooting Gallery in Maslak. Her friends came and picked her up. Why would you like to see her? - It's just business. - So are you having fun Meral? - It's hopeless. Stop trying to entertain me. I cannot forget Halil. I wish it was him in front of me, not you. My whole life is filled with Halil now. I'm in love with him Basar. - Halil! - I came here to see you, but I don't want to now. That's all. - Please stop, don't go. It's not my world that you see now. Don't get it wrong. I didn't come here to have fun. - You don't have to explain. Just, let me go. - For months I've waited for you. - I want to go. - Take me with you. - I'll go alone. - So this is your last word? - Yes. - All right then, go. But know that I won't be in your life anymore. - Halil! Let me go! Get out of my way! You rascal! Murderer! Get out! Murderer! Let me go! Halil! I'm telling you for the last time. Stop the car or I'll jump. - How can I leave you out in the cold? Are you crazy? Come to your senses, will you! - I said stop, or else... - Fine, you don't wanna get in, but at least put on your shoes. I said put them on! Aah, enough with this foolishness. You'll get sick. - I said get out of here. Get the hell out of here! I don't wanna see you. - So be it! - My goodness, what's that woman doing out there? - Could you stop please, I want to get off. - Don't ever leave me Halil. You don't only if you don't want to. My place is here with you. Go to my father, do whatever, but don't leave me. - I liked you a lot young man. You can be a good husband for my daughther. Who knows, may be you'll have beautiful kids. You're both young, beautiful and healthy. They say people who love each other have more beautiful kids. You're very good looking. Eh, my daughther is pretty. What else is there to say. My girl has picked a good husband for her. I don't like custom made marriages. My daughther will marry whoever she wants to. I don't care about wealth, poverty or career. As a father, I merely want my daughther's happiness. It's also my duty as a father, to support my girl and my son-in-law, financially. That's all I'd say about it. So, do I sound like a traditional father? OK, there's another side of it though. Look son, Meral is a rich girl. She hasn't experienced hardship in this world. I mean, she's spoilt. She doesn't know what poverty is. Yes, on a Fall day on the Island, on a weekend trip, in an empty house, she can see a man who is in love with her picture, and love him back. This is such a romantic and pleasant adventure. But soon, Meral's behaviors will change according to her financial status. Do you understand? Don't get me wrong. I just wouldn't want to see this beautiful dream of yours collapse. - I liked your father a lot Meral. He has nothing to do with it. I've decided myself. - This decision means death to me. But I won't ask you to change your mind. - I love you more than any man could ever love a woman. I want to keep it that way. That's all. - Who the hell are you to marry Meral? Answer me. I came here to ask you this. You insolent bastard! What a shameless man you are! After your trick of falling in love with the picture, now you wanna marry her. Perhaps you haven't taken enough beating. I'll beat you myself this time. I am going to marry Meral. She won't marry an unworthy beggar like you. How dare you went to see her father?! I'll kick your ass if I see you looking at her again! Talk to me bastard! Talk to me you animal! - Meral Ilter is getting married. Bergin Uzgerk designed the magnificient bridal dress. Ah this world! This rotten world! I won't let you get away with it! I won't! The End
