Thought you were gonna give up that refined sugar. - I am. - When? - Any day now. - Yeah? Bad for your vocal cords. Body, mind, spirit, remember? I bought a little machine for making demos. Yeah? I bet you're good. What makes you say that? Intuition. All right, well, I'll see you later, Jake. Okay. See you later, honey.

Pip. - What the fuck is a Pip? - Why you gotta curse so much? You know, like Gladys Knight and the Pips. Like this: Huh. Check this out! - Oh, come on! - Stop it. Yeah. Break it. Uh-uh. Don't do that right now. Dont't do that. - Oh, the spin? - What? - Wait a minute. Oh stop. - You're gonna blow the whistle? Oh! Come on. I'm gonna look it up right now. Man, I'm looking this up. Look... - Yo, so which one were you? - The one on the right. - Hey, do it again! - Yo, that's not him right there. Man, that's him with an Afro. - He's bald. - So he had a wig on. - That's gone, yo. - That's him. ♪ Get it ♪ ♪ I am sharper than a razor ♪ Damn, girl! Bring it over here now! Hey, Jake.

Thanks. - He ever catch it? - Hm? - The fish. - Oh, yeah. Yes. Yeah, he did. It's a happy ending- Well, not exactly. Old man tied the fish to the side of the boat, had to row back to shore, the fish bled in the water, sharks came, and ate the whole fish till there was nothing left. - That's just kind of a waste, isn't it? - No, depends upon how you look at it. The old man met his greatest adversary just when he thought that part of his life was over. He saw himself in the fish. Came to... Came to respect it the more it fought. Why didn't he just let the fish go? The old man's gotta be the old man. Fish gotta be the fish. Gotta be who you are in this world, right? No matter what. You've got a client. I don't want to. What?

Listen, hey, come, sit down. Sit. Sit. Sit. Okay. - Come on, sit down. - All right. Are you sure I'm not interrupting anything? Yeah. So? I don't know. You know, I just kind of felt like a quiet voice. Before it all goes crazy. Okay. I'm Teri. Bob. Ow. - It's good. - You know, you don't look like a Bob. Oh, yeah? Thank you. You look like a Robert. Robert reads books like this, and Bob watches TV. My real name's Alina. What happened to your face? Something stupid. Look, it's not professional. Just tell me what you think, okay? Oh, wow. Alina the singer. You and I know what I really am. I think you can be anything you wanna be. Maybe in your world, Robert. - Doesn't really happen that way in mine. - Change your world. - There's no ring. - Hm? - On your wedding finger, there's no ring. - No. No Mrs. Robert at home? No. Was there ever? Once. Did you break her heart? She broke mine. You know, I see a lot of widowed guys. Something in your eyes. You know, it's not sad. It's just kind of, lost, you know? You always read books? My wife did. She, uh... She was working her way through the 100 Books Everybody Should Read. She made it to 97, so I figured I... I give it a shot. And one day we'd have something to talk about when we get together. - Wow, a hundred books. - Yeah. - Holy moly. - Heh, heh. - How many have you read, Robert? - Ninety-one. Sorry, this damn thing. Ninety-one books, though. - You're almost done. - Almost. - What are you gonna do after that? - Take singing lessons. Then I'm gonna open a donut factory. - Heh-heh-heh. - Yeah. What? Why you laughing? - You know, I love being up at this hour. - Yeah? Yeah. You know, everything's so dark. It makes everything seem possible again. Yeah, me, I can't sleep at night. Yeah, well, I get to hear your stories. What's your new one about? Oh, it's about a guy who thinks he's a knight in shining armor. The only thing is, he lives in a world where knights don't exist anymore. Kind of sounds like my world. Heh. I'm just up the block. I'm gonna grab a cab or something. Thank you for the quiet voice, Robert. You are very welcome, Alina. Yeah. - Catch you around, all right? - Good night. Shit. See you. What did you do, huh? What did you do to that customer? Slavi, he hit me. Alright. Who the fuck do you think you are? Hm? It's all right. Understand. It's all right, Robert. Let's talk about you not answering my calls. Bitch! Should we give him a card? This girl, she's no good. Call this number. I send you another one. Better. Don't be shy. Make the call. Understand. Coffee? We need more sugar out here. I heard she's at the ICU at Shawmuts. Someone beat her up real good. Dr. Paley to ICU. Dr. Paley to ICU, please. Dr. Mark to the pharmacy. Dr. Mark to the pharmacy, please. Alina. You'll be okay, Alina. You'll be okay. Oh. Watch it. Don't worry, don't worry about it. - It's okay. It's okay. - Here you go. - I can...I can. It's fine. Thank you. - Got it. How's she doing? Alina. How's she doing? - Who are you? - Just a friend. A guy hit her. And she hit him back. A guy called Slavi. So Slavi made example of her. They do that. They burned one girl's face with battery acid. Keep her around as a reminder for the rest of us. They brought Teri over very young. Think she got to the point where, she thought her life could be her's one day. Slavi reminded her it never would be. He said he'd cut her throat next time. He said a whore who fucks and can't talk might be worth twice as much. You and I know what I really am. It's something in your eyes. Change your world. Anything you wanna be. He said he'd cut her throat next time. Why is that piece of shit in my parking space? Hi, Slavi. - Are they upstairs? - Yes. Tevi. You collect from that fuck, Dmitri? Yes. He asked for forgiveness. Forgiveness? I told him. What am I, Jesus Christ? Ha-ha-ha. You lost, dedushka? - How the fuck did he get up here? - I don't know. Should I get rid of him? No. I'm here for that girl. You gave me that a couple of nights ago. We give out lots of cards. You still can't get it up, dedushka? I'm here about a certain girl. She got beat up pretty bad. I'm thinking that maybe you have wrong address, dedushka. This girl, she have name? Her name's Alina. Alina? Mm-mm. Ah... No, it doesn't ring a bell. But whoever she is, I'm sure she must know how to suck the cock. Uh... Okay. Um... Look, I understand. These girls that you, uh... That you represent. I understand it's like they're an investment, so, um... I can give you $9800. It's cash. You're wanting to give me $9000? Ninety-eight hundred. Cash. - For what? - Her freedom. - Uh-huh. - Heh, heh. Can you believe this guy? This guy gonna give me $9000 for one single piece of pussy. Ah, must be Ferrari pussy. You fucking Americans think you can come into my place of business and just buy whatever you want. Beautiful Russian girls, no problem, just throw down this bullshit money. You fucking insult me. Ha-ha-ha. I'm just fucking with you, man. But you got very big balls coming in here. I like that. So, $9000 for the troublemaker. One month. That's it. Why, you think this is one-time payment? I make this off this girl in two weeks. That girl is still child. I still can sell her as virgin, huh? This makes prime earner for good while. Take your fucking money and go back to your house and jerk yourself off 9800 times, and then you come crawling back here and talk to me, huh? She'll be used up by then for sure. Maybe then I will let you have her for nothing. Hm? Okay. You're okay, dedushka? Bye-bye. You know amerikantsy. You forget something? Sixteen seconds. One one-thousand, two one-thousand, three one-thousand. Eight one-thousand. Understand? Twenty-eight minus 9, 19. Nineteen. Your heart's beating three times the normal rate. Because you're losing so much blood. About 30 seconds, your body's gonna shut down and you're gonna suffocate. Alina, the girl you beat half to death, her life is going to go on. Yours is gonna end right here, on this funky floor over $9800. You should have taken the money. Who are you? Twenty-six one-thousand, 27 one-thousand, 28 one-thousand. I'm sorry. Mr. McCall, it's lunchtime. Mr. McCall. Lunchtime. You test tomorrow and you're eating that salty stuff? These are for you. Open it. I made the weight. Tomorrow, I'm gonna ace that test Mr. McCall. Thanks to you. - What happened? - Uh... Hit it on something stupid. In what investigators are calling a gangland-style execution, five men were killed at some point last night in an office above this restaurant. Police sources have said the killings have all the earmarks of a turf war between rival factions. Names are not yet being released... How's it going? - How you doing, sir? - Morgan Pederson. I know who you are. Get in the car. Take me to the murder scene. We figured two, maybe three, guys killed them all that quickly. If it was a power play, no one saw it coming. None of our informants heard about this going down. Security system's harddrive was taken so we're blind in here. All we know is, at 11:17, a waiter goes up with a tray of food, finds them dead. I want images from every security camera within a six-block radius. If you have any trouble, call that number, and it will be taken care of. Phones charged and on. I tend to call at odd hours. Now, if you could drive me to my residence. Hey, wait a second, Mr. Sunshine. Um... What do I look like to you? A fucking chauffeur? This is our town. You're a fucking guest. Let me apologize for my conduct. It was a long flight on short notice, and I like to focus, to work quickly. The deaths of Mr. Pushkin's men have interrupted his operations here. Imports, movements of goods, have all ceased. That's unacceptable. I'm the one Mr. Pushkin calls in when people like you fucked up. - I'm accountable now. - Mm. Listen pal. I don't like your tone... You have taken Mr. Pushkin's money for years. Money that comes with conditions. Non-negotiable conditions. Problem you're having with me is you still think you matter. You don't. I am all that matters. And so we're clear: I'm not here to say "please." I'm here to tell you what to do. Be ready for business. We open tomorrow. Brian, you seen Ralphie? Supposed to be taking that security guard test after work. - Called in and quit. - Quit? No notice either. Kids, right? We're closed. - Mr. McCall. - Ralphie. Heard you quit today. I got worried. Uh... Oh, uh, my mom had a little accident here last night. There was a fire. - I see. - So I'm gonna help out around here now. Okay. - We have a lot of work to do. - Okay. - Yeah, so... - Need some help? Yeah, if you're not doing anything, that'd be, that'd be awesome. - Helping you. - Eh-ha-ha. Listen Teddy, I already check this out. The Irish are clean on this one. They had nothing to do with it, huh? Come on, what are you going to do? You gonna sit down with all these guys? - I'm telling you. - Yes, I understand. Duly noted. Listen, huh? Do me a favor, all right? Whatever you do, don't call him "Little John," okay? Frank, why you working for these fucking Russians? My money not good enough? - John, you know I got respect for your business. - Mr. Looney. You understand why I'm compelled to make this visit. I don't know shit about what went down or who you should be out looking for. If I wanna take over anything, I'd fucking do it. There'd be nothing left to you people. So maybe, you just don't understand who the fuck I am. John. Easy, huh? Don't "easy," Frank. Shut the fuck up! Fucking flipperhead. See, I hate you fucking Russians. You're all crazy and you're arrogant. Now, the Irish, we came here for a piece of the American dream. You people come over here to steal it, so fuck all of you. Well, Mr. Looney, I appreciate your candor. It's refreshing, and let me understand that you're not smart enough to have done this. - The fuck? - Which brings me to my next issue. We pay you 15 percent to do business here. The additional 10 percent you steal, we ignore. We anticipated it, as you people are such clichés. And the fact that you're a rat to the Feds is also tolerable, Little John. - What the fuck? - What we will not tolerate is getting nothing for our money: no information, no protection, no assurances. You understand, Little Johnny? - Who the fuck do you think you are coming down here- - Who I am, or what I am? Who I am is complicated. What I am is easier. I'm a threat. - I alter outcomes. - Throw this motherf... Unh! Whoa, doctor! Call a doctor. Unbelievable! It's Napoli in the clutch! Holy cow! Oh, fuck! A tie game. Unbelievable! That ball was absolutely massacred by Mike Napoli. A home run by Napoli. - Can things change in an instant. - They certainly can. This game was over before this half-inning started. It is certainly over now! Six to five, Boston over New York... Hey! Hey! Hey. This is my town. Do you understand me? This is my home. You cannot run around like a fucking wild animal. What the fuck was that? It's a message. It says, "I'm here." What really happened in there, Ralphie? Faulty wire or something. We both know that's not true. - I'm sorry I wasted your time Mr. McCall. - Hey, you didn't waste my time. Don't worry about it. My mom doesn't have much except this place and... You know when stuff like this happens, I just gotta put everything on hold for a while... and help her out, you know. What was I thinking. I wasn't gonna pass the security guard test anyway. Was there anything unusually strange about Slavi before he was murdered? Did he mention a name perhaps? Agitated about something? Slavi never did his business in front of the girls. Tevi handled us. We can't locate one of the other girls from Slavi's stable. Teri. - You know her? - No. - Where we might find her? - No. Sorry. I didn't know her that well. Was my message received, Teddy? Yes, Mr. Pushkin. All of our associates... Irish, Italians, Armenians. Are all denying any knowledge or involvement. We cannot show weakness. I need this wrapped up quickly. It will be. Of course, don't worry. Good. Now enough of what you don't know. Tell me what you do know. Well, I'm still sifting through things, but the killings were spontaneous. Whoever did this specialized in killing. I've rarely seen skills like this. I don't think it's someone we've encountered before. Whoever it is, just find him, Teddy. I'm talking over a million barrels, this delivery. - Understand? - It will all be well. I'll take care of it. When you do, be loud about it. I don't want this happening again. Of course. Come on. Stuff it in. See that? That son of a bitch. - Yeah. - Come on. - We're closed. Get out. - Let's go. Time to go. Nice to see you. See? You pay on time, no more problems. - Ha-ha-ha. - All right, let's go. Mamacita, you need to clean the grease. - It'll cause a fire. - That's a good accent. We'll see you next week. - Come on, let's go to the Banana and get a blowie. - Hey, officers. Whoa, put the light down. What's up? - I'd like to report a crime. - Really? Call 911. Come on. Let's get out of here. Fuck that guy. - Yah, I should have shot that motherfucker. - Yeh, take it easy. - How did you get this job? - I blew the commissioner. Why waste city services when I got two corrupt cops right in front of me? - It's that guy. - This fucking guy? - Yeah. - Back up. How'd you get that fucking number? - Wasn't hard. - Yeah? - Neither is this. - Ask the lady down the street. The one who had the fire. Same thing could happen to you with your whole fucking family in it. - Open it. - You pay like everybody else. How many copies? One. Yeah, you must have a death wish, pal. What the fuck do you want, huh? Huh? Those people you took the money from, - maybe you should give it back. - Ha-ha-ha. Why would we do that? That would be in the best interest of everyone involved. - Really? - Yeah. Well, maybe our best interest is to tie a cinder block around your waist and throw you in the fucking Mystic, huh? Let's do that. It's a good idea. You're supposed to stand for something, punk. Fuck. Protect and serve. Uphold the law. Justice. Remember? Who the fuck are you? Tomorrow you'll have returned all the money you extorted from those people. You will tell them it will never happen again. You do that, and this video will never be seen. You don't, and a half an hour later you'll watch the uncut version on every news outlet in the area. Now, I'm offering you a chance to do the right thing. Take it. That fucking hurt more than the beating. Mr. McCall. Are you done standing around or what? All the other girls have... claimed that you were very close to Teri. Huh? You lied to me about that. It's pretty. When did you last talk to her? - Over a week ago. - Mm-hm. I went to the hospital. I saw her there. Did anyone else visit her? Yes. - A man. - A man? - Customer? - No. A nice man. A black man. He wanted to know what happened to her. His name? He didn't say. And your friend, Teri? No one saw her after she left the hospital. After what they did to her. - And you contacted her? - No. No one saw her. Look at me. Are you telling me the truth? - You telling me the truth? - Yes - You telling me the truth? - Yes. - You telling me the truth? - Yes. - Telling me the truth? - Yes. Would you like some water? Moisten your throat. Thank you. Sweet. My angel. - Hm? Yes. - Please. Please. - So beautiful. So beautiful. - Please, please, Teddy. Please, Teddy. - But so deceitful. - Please. Please don't. - So fucking deceitful. - Please don't. You're... You're hurting me! Please stop. Let's go, Home Mart! - Let's go! - Keep it going, Home Mart! Here we go. Oh, oh, oh! I got it! I got it! I got it! Yeah! Yeah! There you go! Way to go, Bobby! There's no place like Home Mart. Yeah. Oh! - I see you! - Ralphie, bravo! You passed your test! Looking good, man. Hey, did they give you a gun? What the hell he call us in here for? Maybe he's finally done chasing his own tail you know. - He needs to go home. - Waste of fucking time. Yeah, that sounds about right. I matched the arrival and departure times.. of everyone going in and out of the restaurant. And I discovered a curious. This person walks in the front door several minutes after Slavi arrived, but never comes out. - Alright. - Yah, thanks. - Alright. Jenny, Jenny, Jenny. Can you do a quick card refund for me when you are done. - Gentleman's in a hurry. - Open that fucking register. Move, move. Empty the register. Now. Go ahead, open this thing up. Tell this bitch to fucking move it. Open the register up right now. Move. All of it. Give me all of it. Come on. Move, move, move, move, move. - That ring too. Give me that ring. - No. - Give me that fucking ring, I said. - Please. It was my mother's. Fuck your mother. Give me that ring. - Take it off. - It was my mother's. Shh. I don't care. Give me the fucking ring. - Please. - It's okay, Jenny. You okay? Yeah. Heh, ya, listen. Police said the guy's done four like this. Shot a guy over in Somerville a month ago or so. It's only money. - You okay? - Hey, Ralphie. Yah, still a little freaked out. Well, if you need anything, let me know. Thanks, Ralphie. Oh, my God. My ring. - Mr. McCall. Sorry to bother you. - Yeah. We're looking into a homicide that occurred two weeks ago. Five dead. Russian restaurant. Oh yah, I heard about it on TV. I happened to be there that night. - Oh, you were? - Yah. - You wouldn't be here if I wasn't. - That's right. We're just checking to see if any of the patrons remembered anything suspicious that night. Not that I recall. May I ask why you dined at that particular restaurant? I like pirozhki. There's five authentic Russian restaurants within walking distance of your apartment. - Hm. I assume they all serve pirozhki. Wow. I was meeting a friend. It was her idea. - Then I guess I should talk... - Sheila... Sheila Saunders. But she won't be any help. She wasn't there. Her daughter had a fever. - Didn't stay long? - I didn't check my watch. I see. Well, thanks for your cooperation. - Very welcome. - Tell me, do you know this girl? Yeah, I don't know... I don't remember where it from. What happened to her? - She fell down and broke her neck. - Did she? I'll be in touch. Don't you wanna leave me your card, officer? In case I remember anything? That's what you policemen usually do, right? Must have given them all out. How'd you find me? I paid cash. We didn't have a reservation. How'd you find me? - Well, that's what we do, Mr. McCall. - We who? - We find people we need to find. - We who? Everything about him is wrong. And his military history? No. Keep digging. This is what we have on Ronald McCall so far: College-educated. Works a straight 40 at the Home Mart. Bank statements, tax returns, all jive. Looks pretty normal. All lies. Fabricated. We need to take him cleanly. Alive. A place without cameras, no witnesses. A man with his skills, I want to know who he really is. I want to know who he's working for. How you doing? Give me a coffee, please. An egg sandwich too. On a roll. No cheese, please. You got it. I'll be back in a minute. Is it just you, or are we waiting for someone else? I'm sorry. What? Your hands. If you really work the power lines, now your hands wouldn't look like that. I know we gotta be waiting for somebody else. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. Motherfucker. Hands where I can see them. We're gonna take a little walk across the street. Me and you, Black Denali. Here we go. What the fuck? You vary from these instructions and I'm gonna kill you, you understand? All right. Stand up. What the fuck is this? Masters, let's go. No witnesses. What's going on out there? What the fuck? Let's go. Shh. What the hell is this guy doing? Remar, you got A side. Front, follow. You got C. I got B. Alive. Yeah, yeah, alive. I'm on it. Motherfucker. Motherfucker suckered me. Goddamn it. Shit. Pederson, check the closets, the kitchen, and the back porch. Closet's empty. - Nothing on the back porch. - Fucking guy. Lives like a monk. Man, this guy's got a lot of fuckin' books. Remar, stop fucking around. Check the computer. This place is way too clean, boss. Something doesn't feel right. We've got an empty script. "Meclizine." It's used for airsickness. A bunch of travel items purchased three days ago. Bought an open-ended plane ticket to Mexico two days ago. Leaves Logan 10 A.M. tomorrow. Guy knew this was coming. - He's on the running. - Let's get someone down at the airport. - He is not going anywhere. - Wait, what are you talking about? He's watching us. What do you wanna do? Find him, or I will bring people who can. If you've come for my help, I can't give you any. - I understand. - Do you? Just came for tea. Just, uh... Robert, I have very little influence these days. I'm not at the Agency anymore. I consult on a few things. That's it. Susan, I just need to know who this man is. Who is he to you? That's why I'm here, trying to find out. Tell me what's going on. Please. You had a nice funeral, in case you were wondering. You know, when they told Susan you were dead, she couldn't comprehend it. She said, "Oh, no. Not Robert." And not from something as trivial as a car bomb." That you're alive is a big relief. But it didn't come as a complete surprise to her. We used to talk about you over the years, you know and she said if anyone could have figured a way out, a way to walk away from it all, for good, you know, like a real fresh start, it would have been... you. You didn't take out five pimps, Robert. You took out the East Coast hub of Vladimir Pushkin. Pushkin. Mm-hm. He is similar to the other oligarchs who jumped in bed with the Russian mafia, only he funds everything: Gasoline, weapons, girls, you name it. He's built an intricate network on both U.S. coasts that are incredibly well-insulated. His money and political ties make him untouchable. Your friend here is who Pushkin sends when he's got a problem. Teddy Rensen. Real name, Nicolai ltchenko. Skill set honed in Spetsnaz. He's formidable and smart. Ran a wing of the secret police for years. Went private when the Union fell. Basically, he's a sociopath with a business card. Mm. Thank you, darling. You know these two? Uh... Boston P.D. Probably on Pushkin's payroll, I assume. Three years. Detective Remar and Detective Pederson. Only now they're dead. They found them yesterday in the trunk of their car in the precinct parking lot. Suffocated. Testicles blown off and shoved down their throats. Classic Russian mob hit. Teddy's work. Third one, Detective Masters hasn't shown up for work in several days. Robert, I don't have to tell you what happens next. He won't stop until he kills you and anyone you care about. Didn't sleep a wink, did you? Hey. Mm. Robert, that girl, Alina... Why? I couldn't tell you why it mattered. Why what they did to her, that mattered to me so much. One day somebody does something unspeakable to someone else to... someone you hardly knew, and you... - do something about it because you can. - Mm. - Because it's who you are? - Hm? - Mm. Who you've always been? Sometimes we... we make the wrong choices to get to the right place. Mm. I know a part of you died when Vivian did. But not the part she loved the most. Go be him. Yep. Don't forget to say goodbye. Good bye. Everything all right? Were you able to help him? He didn't come for help. He came for permission. Fuck. What the fuck? Testing one, two, three, four. Pushkin. I need to know everything: Who, what, when, where, why. Before you tell me you're not gonna talk... You can go fuck yourself, you know that? You're gonna give me what I need. Or not. You're such a fuck. Why don't you get out of here and go fuck yourself, you fucking motherfucker. You know who the fuck you're dealing with, huh? I am a cop, you moron! I swear to God, I'll fuck... Okay. Open it. Open the fucking wind... Huh? - I'm Boston P.D. - I don't have a lot of time. Which means you don't have any. Look, you are in a lot of trouble. Just let me go. Just let me go. I'm gonna let you go. I'm gonna let you go. I'll be back. No! Motherfucker! Wait. Wait! Wait! We're here to see Andri. Hey, Andri. Listen, this location's been compromised. You got to get all your shit out of here. You gotta truck it all the fuck out. The fuck I'm going to do that. And who's this fucking piece of shit? Pushkin made the call. I'm just the... new guy. - Pushkin. - Pushkin. I... Pushkin's fucking money. What the fuck you give a fuck, Andri, huh? Is that a Heckler Koch? - This? - Yeah. What is he saying? I don't fucking... - Can I see it? - Oh, you want to see my gun? Uh, yes and no. - No. - Oh, fuck! All right, all right, all right! Whoa, whoa, whoa! You're so fucking nuts! Fuck! All right. Everybody settle down. Frank tells me you're the man, Andri. Yeah? He says your guys are incredibly loyal toward you. They'll do anything you say. So if you tell them to put their guns down, lay down on the floor with their hands behind their back. They'll do that, won't they? Indulge me, Andri. Tell them to lay down. There you go. Thank you very much. There you go. Mr. Pushkin thanks you very much. We're going out of business. Closing down shop. Mr. Pushkin thanks you very much. There you are sweetheart. Here you go. You're welcome. Please accept these parting gifts on behalf of Mr. Pushkin. There you go. Three, two... Look at that, perfect... one. Thank you. Thank you, sweetheart. Right around to the right. Call it in. - Boston P.D. - Detective Frank Masters. I am 10-13 at 155 Warren Street, rear entrance. Repeat. Detective Frank Masters, 10-13, 155 Warren Street, rear entrance. - Anything else I can do for you? - You tell me, Frank. I know you got an escape plan. Where do you keep it? Heh. Yeah? What's your fucking escape plan, huh? Not about me. It's about you right now. Where do you keep it? You know fuck you, you motherfucker. You have fucked me so fucking bad! - You did this! You motherfucker. - Do you hear yourself? You did it to this badge, Frank. You disrespected this badge. You understand me? Fuck you, you motherfucker. I got nothing, all right? I got fucking nothing. You hear me. I got fucking nothing because of you! You think they're not coming for you, you think you're not fucking next? - I am a fucking dead man! - Well, do something about it, Frank. You don't know who the fuck these people are! I'm a fucking dead man. I won't last a fucking week. Then do the right thing. Motherfu... Do the right thing, Frank. Police officer for 22 years, I know you didn't get this far and not have an out. - Where do you keep it? - I was a fucking good cop. I was. I understand. Do the right thing. Do it for the good cops, Frank. Where do you keep it? Just let me know when you're done, detective. This guy here. He was cuffed to the pipes back here, 200,000 in the trunk of his car. Recording of the whole deal with these guys on the seat. Crazy right. And that was tacked to his jacket. That's not the best part. We're on scene for the duration. - Get IDs on all those guys. - Check this out. Holy shit! Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Who's gonna fucking count this? We've searched the city. No sign of him. McCall has disappeared. Mr. Pushkin has been notified. My men will find him. Good. I got to piss. He's not coming back. Had enough? You certainly have my attention. Because I can keep going. Brick by brick. Dollar by dollar. Body by body. Or... you can call your boss and tell him to shut down his operation. Tonight. - That's not much of an offer. - That's the only one you're gonna get. When you pray for rain, you gotta deal with the mud too. When you look at me, what do you see? Hm? The answer's nothing. I have no feelings about you one way or the other. You're like... Like lint or a bottle cap. You're just a thing to remove. I knew a Russian police captain back in the day. He told me about a case he worked on. Can't remember the guy's name. He was a famous scholar, lived in Moscow. He was a humanitarian, an author. Anyway, he decided to share his abundance with someone less fortunate. And even though he had five beautiful children, he opened his home to a sixth. An orphan, 12-year-old boy. Kid had been pounded by the system from an early age. Troubled. Prone to violence. A lost cause. - Stop me if you know this one. - Oh, no. Carry on. Okay. So this good man opened his home to this boy. And when the boy stole from him, this good man loved him anyway. When the boy failed in school, this good man showed understanding and Patience. When the boy lied and cheated and clawed and fought, this good man showed compassion and love. Until the boy, who had never felt anything like being wanted or loved, he finally did. The man had broken through. By all accounts, it was a miracle. One week later, intruders broke into the man's house. Killed the man and his wife in bed. They said some small things were stolen, things a child might steal. No one knows for sure. The man's children were sent off to live with relatives. The boy, the orphan, shipped back to hell. Just when he finally had a chance at life, it was snatched away by two bullets. - It's a well-known story. - Mm. They ever catch who did it? Did they? Maybe they didn't look in the right place. Sometimes the answer's right in front of you. I think the boy killed them. Yah, I think the boy did it. I think the boy was scared that his foster parents would wake up one day and realize he wasn't worth it, like all the others had. And he couldn't bear the thought that this man, this good man would do that to him. Would throw him away... like a piece of lint or a bottle cap. So... he decided not to find out. What do you think, Nicolai? You think you know me? You strike me as a sentimental man, Mr. McCall. That's surprising. I... I don't possess that chip. I never could understand what comes from feeling that way except weakness. The men I killed, your men, I gave them a chance. They made their decision. I'm giving you the opportunity to make yours. - Thank you. - You're welcome. You let me know... when you decide. Of course. I've done some bad things in my life, Nicolai. Things I'm not proud of. I promised someone that I loved very much that I would never go back to being that person. But for you... I'm gonna make an exception. You asked me what I saw when I looked at you. What do you see when you look at me? FBI. How can I direct your call? Agent Mosley, please. - Agent Mosley. - Heard you found some money today. Who is this? Concerned citizen. Check your personal e-mail. Make sure you're sitting down when you do. He hit my tankers. And you tell me not to worry? That you'll take care of things? Only I've been further embarrassed. I have a new team. It's simply a matter of time. You're out of time. New York had to shut down. Nothing is moving. My calls aren't being answered. I've lost tens of millions today alone. It will all be well. Stop the bleeding, or don't come back. Go fuck yourself. - Yes? - Mr. McCall. Nicolai. - Your life for theirs. - Whose? You'll want to answer that. - Yes? - Mr. McCall? - Ralphie? - They came into the store when we were closing and they have guns. - Who's with you? - Jenny, Brian, Jay, and Marcus. What's going on? Wait... Oh, my God. No. My men there will kill them in 30 minutes. Unless you're here in 29. You know the place. You can still smell the burning gasoline in the air. He's close. Get ready. Here comes the bus. Just checking on you, sentimental man. - Yeah? - You willing to die for your friends? Are you? When you see him, shoot him. The bus is empty. Kill one. Kill one of them. You wanna be first? - Where is that coming from? - I don't know. I don't know! They're gonna kill Ralphie, yo. They're gonna fucking kill him. ♪ Too much for the man ♪ ♪ He couldn't make it ♪ - Stop.
