(dramatic music) (dog whining) (happy music) (dog whining) (loud ticking) (children shouting) (school bell rings) - All right, class, turn in your assignments. Did you do your homework, Denis? (scary music) - My dog ate it? (woman sighs) My dog ate it. (loud whoosh) My dog ate it. (loud whoosh) (dog whimpers) (loud chirping) (crow caws) (loud gunshot) (sighs) Did you turn off the alarm? - If that woman doesn't stop shooting off her gun anymore I think I'm gonna shoot her! - [Denis] I'm gonna miss my train. - Probably should've gotten up earlier. - I've got a deployment today, I might be home late. - As long as you're home in time to deal with your mother. - [Chuck] From NBR in Washington, I'm Chuck Sears. The national unemployment rate continues to hold steady according to a government report issued today, despite economic signs of recovery. (happy music) (chiming bells) The latter category of workers remain unemployed the longest. - Can I get six, seven breakfast tacos? Do they all come with egg? - Anything you want. - One of the guys in the office is a vegetarian. - [Renata] We have bean. - Do vegetarians eat egg? - [Renata] Some do, some don't. - I'll take three, no, four potato and egg, two egg and bacon, and two bean, ah, wait, Marty doesn't like bacon, make that one without. - Four potato, two bacon, two bean? - Egg. - Four potato and egg, one bacon and egg, one egg without bacon, two bean, do you want egg on the bean? - Just bean, oh, and an egg with cheese. - Nine tacos. 13.86. (loud car honk) (train bell rings) (train honks) (train revs loudly) (loud screech) (telephone rings) - Hey. Big day today? I brought reinforcements. (happy music) - Yeah, this is great. - Thanks. - Uhm, got something for you in my office. (loud buzzing) - Milosz has been working on tonight's party all week, we're grill and steaks, you don't need to bring anything. Swimsuit optional. - Ah, I'm not gonna make it, Denis. Could you close the door? - I thought you were gonna be in my volleyball team. We nailed them last time. (phone rings) - Uhm, Denis, we've got a situation here in the office. - I worked out the interface problem, figured it out last night. - We needed it yesterday. - [Denis] The deadline is today. - The client called over an hour ago. Denis, where were you? - Milosz turned off the alarm, what can I do? (Marty sighs) - This just isn't gonna work out. - What do you mean? - [Marty] Things have changed here in the office. - I didn't miss the, I didn't miss the deadline. - No, but you're not keeping up with the workforce. - I'm getting the job done. - It takes you twice as long. - I'll have the deployment finished today. - Diane is taking over the project at this point. - What? I've already done all the work. It's almost ready to go. - This isn't a good fit for you anymore. (phone rings) (Denis exhales loudly) - What do you want me to work on instead? (Marty sighs) - Why don't you take some time to look at your long range goals. Take Milosz on a vacation, when was the last you took a cruise? - I have vacation scheduled next month. - Well I'll be sure to add all your vacation time into your package. - My package? - God, Denis, don't be dense. You're terminated. I need you to fill out some paperwork for me. - I'm fired? Marty, what am I supposed to do? (loud chirping) (dog whimpers) (dog barks) - Robert, come here (claps palms), hiss. - Go away, shu. - [Woman] Sorry about that. - It's okay. (scary music) - I'll handle this. (loud whoosh) (maniacal laughing) (crow caws) - [Julie] From NBR News in Washington, I'm Julie Taylor. Despite economic indicators showing an end to the recession, workers 45 and older continue to be out of work and are falling into a new class of terminally unemployed. Analysts say those who find work are less likely to be hired at wages comparable to their previous employment. (door is shut loudly) - Hey. You finished work early. - You could say that. - (mumbles) guests, take that out to the pool. (men laughing) (water splashes) - [Man] Yay! - [Denis] Hey, Mom. - There's my desk jockey. Get your platform launched? - Deployed. - Whatever you call it. - Your mother-in-law's a trip, when is she going home again? - I can stay up for a while. - Keep your shorts on, she's going home soon. - How'd it go at work? - Not good. - Yeah, what happened? - I was canned. - What? - Why didn't you tell me? - You were busy. - [Mary] You were fired? - I don't think our neighbor heard you. - What did Marty say? - Came from above, nothing he could do about it. - That's what's happening in this global economy, pretty soon, everyone will be out of a job. - They can hire these college kids cheaper. It was a cost thing. - [Mary] Talk to his boss. - It's a done deal. - (sighs) The problem with your generation is that don't have to fight for anything, everything's just handed to you. - And the problem with your generation is you think you're experience is the same as ours, you worked and made decent money, we got screwed. - Somebody getting screwed? - Not till she goes home. (men laugh) - I think you should still go back Monday and talk to someone. - What does it matter? The decision is final. - You guys have it so easy. Now, look, you should try holding a full-time job and raise children at the same time. - Milosz doesn't want children. - Ha, maybe you're not doin' right. - Maybe we're just not doing it. - If you had children, you wouldn't have time to think about your life. I never did. Who has time to think when you're trying to change diapers all the time? At least get a dog. - I didn't know you were into diaper play. - Time to be home, Mom. - Oh, I can stay up a while. - No really, Mom, time to turn in. - All right. I know you boys want to play, I'll leave it to you. - Thanks, Mom, you're the best. - I, I'm gonna leave the baskets here, could you bring them next week to the house? - You okay? - Yeah, I just got up too quickly. Use protection. - We have lots of sunscreen. (men laughing) - That's not what I mean. (loud chirping) - [Milosz] Good night. Are you sure you could drive home? All right. - Why did you do that? - To help the environment. - 60 seconds of your plasma burns more energy than this thing does in an entire year. - Every kilowatt counts. (Denis sighs) (sighs) What are you gonna do now? - Beats me. - We don't have to stay here, we could sell and move. - [Denis] The economy sucks everywhere. - We could move to Durango. - And do what? Albuquerque? - Ugly. Chama. - Ugly and we can't afford it. - Well, we could always go to L.A., you could get a job there. - How can I afford to pay for us to live in L.A.? Even if we sold this place, we couldn't afford a down payment. - [Milosz] We could grow our own food. - You can't even grow a tomato. It's not the end of the world, I still bring home the bacon. - Oh, so this is about me not having an outside job. - You know I support your writing efforts. - Blogging. - Blogging. - Not that supportive. - Don't walk out in the middle of a conversation, I hate when you do that. - You're toasted. - I'm trying to talk to you. - It won't matter. You're gonna do what you're gonna do anyway. It's like living with a Buddhist. I have no idea what's going on with you. - [Denis] I'm talking to you now. (Milosz gargles) - When's the last time we had sex? - You're not interested. - Valentine's. I've been in that bed every night since. - So this is about sex? (Milosz sighs) - No. This is about you not being interested. Forget it. You're tired. - No, let's get it out. - I don't think we should say anything we might regret later. I'm going to bed. (angrily rips off clothes) Good night. - [Denis] Night. (loud chirping) (crow caws) (rifle is cocked loudly) (loud gunshot) I'm gonna get a paper. - Paper? - To look for jobs. (Milosz chuckles) - It's been a while since you've looked for jobs. Everything's online now, it's all online. - Well, I'll be back. (dogs barking) (broom sweeps loudly) I'm looking for a dog. - Picked up two this morning, what's it look like? - I'm not sure. I was thinking maybe a small dog. - You don't know what it looks like? - Can I see a few before I decide? - Oh, I thought you lost one. Uhm, we got a bunch to choose from. - I don't know what kind of dog I want. I used to have a Beagle. What breed is that? - Mutt. (chain-link fence clinks) - Hm, is that bad? - Well, some think it is, others think it's better. - Hm, do you think it might be a Beagle? - Mostly mutt. - [Denis] Looks like Beagle. - Well, there's probably some Beagle involved somewhere in the past. - Hm, haven't had a dog since I was a kid. It was a Beagle. - This is a good dog. - I better think about it. (ominous music) - Well, don't think too long. (happy goofy music) It's time to play pick your doggy. Do you like doggy one? Dog number two? Dog number three? Or what's behind door number four? (crowd cheers) - I'm not sure. - Which will be? Number one? Number two? (dog barks) Number three? Or the mystery dog (door creaks), number four? - I'm not sure. - Time, it's running out. - I'm not sure. - Make your decision, this is-- (loud wheel clicking) - [Crowd] Your last chance! (loud gunshots) - Jesus! No, that's not at you, it's my nutso neighbor shooting off her guns again. Oh, she's a paramilitary bulldyke. Any war's a good war as long as she can watch it on TV. (bottle opener clicks) Yeah. Well we're just here because of Denis' mom. No, he wanted to be near her like a good mama's boy, but I'm the one that ends up talking to her all the time. After she dies, we're getting out of this heat. (chuckles) No, she's too feisty to die. I'll probably be shot by the gun freak next door. (door clangs loudly) Oh, Denis is home, I gotta go, see you tomorrow. Wear yourself out? - Was good. (Milosz chuckles) - I sent your mom a birthday card. - Oh, I should've done that. (Milosz sniffs loudly) - Man, you reek. Go take a shower. (loud buzzing) - Have you seen the paintbrush? - I haven't moved it. What are you doing? - It's a dog house. - Is Mary getting a dog? - I was thinking we could. - We don't have the money for a dog. - It's not that much. - Are you coming? - No, I got stuff to do. - This is important, we've gotta show them they can't get away with it. - You don't need me. - Have a nice day. See you tonight. - [Denis] Bye. What the fuck? - [Man] It's gotta get down (mumbles). - Excuse me. I'm looking for the right brush. - What will you be painting. - A dog house. - Hm, this one will work. - What about this one? - That'll work too. - But you think this one is better? (telephone rings) - You could use a roller, it would go faster. - I hadn't thought about that. (loud applause) (car horn honks) - Oh. - Oh, hey. - Hey. - This is really great, no? - I'm back. - Yeah. - Which brings me to the second mode of civil disobedience. At the time we have the right to raise our issues beyond (speaker is drowned out by loud rustling). (dogs barking) - Excuse me, where's the dog I was looking at? - Which one? - [Denis] The Beagle. - Oh, it's not here anymore. - Was it adopted? - No. - [Denis] Where is it? - It's not here. - Did it get loose? - No. - I'm here to adopt it. - Sir, we had to put the dog down. - What do you mean? That was my dog. - Well you should've adopted him when you came in. - I wasn't sure then, I'm sure now. I'm gonna take it home. - [Woman] Sir, the dog's been euthanized. - I was just looking at it, it was in this cage. - We needed the cage, we pick up a lot of puppies this time a year. - But that was my dog. - I'm sorry, sir. - You killed it? What was wrong with it? - I told you, we needed the cage. - But that was going to be my dog. - Well, you know, the world keeps on spinnin'. (paint drips loudly) (dog whimpers) (intense music) (loud gunshots) (Denis screams) (woman laughs maniacally) (Denis screams) Here, little doggy, you're gonna get it! (dog whimpers) (Denis screams) (loud gunshots) (dog cries) (loud chirping) - I'm home. - Hi. - How was your day? - Fine. - How's your dog house coming? - Meet anyone? - Yes. - They killed the dog I was gonna adopt. I went back to the pound to get my dog and they'd euthanized it. (Milosz sighs) - Wow. That's what happens when you take so long to figure out what you want, something dies. (telephone rings) (loud energetic music) - Hi, Mom. - [Mary] How's the job search? - Fine. - [Mary] Any interviews? - First one is tomorrow, but I don't know. - What? - I'm not sure I wanna work for this company. I mean, do I wanna do the same thing I have been all these years, or should I branch out into development? - I don't doubt, don't ask me these things, I'm terrible with these decisions. What does Milosz think? - He's wrapped up with his protest stuff. - I'd hate for you to make a bad decision. - Yeah, I know, I'm just not sure. - Well, it's a tough market. - Not with my skills. I'll probably get hired with the first interview. I have a master's in Computer Technology and 19 years experience. I enjoy working alone in a quiet environment. (chuckles) You won't need to train me. I'm a late night person. I studied a lot of this in college, so I'm sure I could figure it out. I'm a real team player, big offices are where I do best. Could I get some training for that? Isn't this a pyramid scheme? - No, no, no, no, no, it's an investment opportunity. - I'm sure I can find my high school diploma, (people talking loudly in the background) if you need it. - I don't think you're qualified. Besides, you're like really old. Be like my dad working here. Creep me out. - You're lucky getting fired. - Right. - I hate driving into town every day, spending too much money on lousy lunches, fighting the traffic back home. (sighs) I don't have any time to do anything, you've got your whole day to do whatever you want. - Whatever I want, I don't know what that is. - If my boss gave me the axe, I'd start my own business. Work from home. The money's in consulting now. I could work in my underwear if I wanted, 'cause nobody would be watching. - It's not a bad idea. I've got it. - [Milosz] You've got what? - Do we have any signboard? - [Milosz] There's some in the garage. - This is the best thing that could've happened to me. I'm gonna consult. - With who? - Not who, what. - Okay. So what? - Other businesses. I don't know why I didn't think of this a long time ago. - Aren't there a lot of other business consultants in the city? - That's why this is so good. I'll be doing it from home, no more commuting. And we'll get to see each other more. - That would be good. If it works. - Of course it will. I'm an expert with this. (Milosz sighs) (birds singing) (intense violin music) - Good night. - (kissing smack) Good night. Do you think we should paint the house? (loud keyboard typing) - Why would we paint the house? - Feng Shui colors maybe? Couldn't hurt. - Let's put red flowers out in front, it's the same thing. - How are your parents doing? - They're fine. - Didn't you say they were going back to Poland? - At the end of the summer. - We should go, I'd love to meet your relatives. - Yeah, I'd rather visit my father's side in Palermo. - Italy would be good. - Why don't you ask your mom to buy us tickets? - I should ask her. - Okay. - Would it be better to go in early fall or should we wait till Christmas? - (sighs) Look, I gotta finish this. - Yeah, okay, I got stuff to do anyway. (railroad crossing alarm rings) (train screeches) - [Man] Stand clear of the door. (loud chiming) (train horn honks) (train revs loudly) (loud chirping) (rifle is cocked loudly) (loud gunshot) (telephone rings) - Hi, Mom. I'm in the middle of paying bills. - If you come up short, let me know. (Denis sighs) - I got it covered. - Don't feel ashamed to ask. - Bingo, I have bingo! - Ah, Mom, I gotta go, Milosz is calling me. - Denis, this is my second bingo tonight. (speaks quietly) Hello? - Not so easy to work from home, is it? - Can't believe no one has called. - Just takes time. - This is stupid, I shouldn't be doing this. - It's what you said you wanted to do. - I don't know what I wanna do, okay? (loud chirping) (Milosz slams vacuum cleaner) - [Milosz] Are you gonna get up? - Can you let me sleep another five minutes? - Denis, you've been in bed for 12 hours. - I'm tired. - Yeah, well (slams vacuum cleaner) I've gotta vacuum. (vacuum cleaner engine buzzes) - All right, all right. Can't that wait? - Until when? Till you get another job? - I live here too, you know. This is also my house. - Good, then you vacuum. - That's not our deal. - You're right, our deal was that you make the money and I clean the house. Well now I'm bringing in the money, so you can help the house. - Fine, you want me to vacuum, I'll vacuum. You want me to dust? I'll dust (toys clink on floor). Why do we have all this shit? (toy thuds) (toys break on floor) - [Milosz] What the fuck are you doing? - You want me to do the dishes? - Not if you're gonna break them. - I can if I want to. (ping-pong balls click on floor) I can do anything I want, I worked 20 fucking years to pay for all this crap. I paid for it. I worked like a fucking dog for those people, most treated me like shit! 20 years and all I've got for it is this? This? Now that I'm home all the time, you act like I'm in the way. Well get over it, I'm the reason you're here. - I don't act like you're in my way. - Yes, you do, the way you smirk at me when I go to the fridge, the way you scowl when I'm on the phone. - Yeah, all right Mr. I-Am-An-Expert, you're a pain in the ass. I get as half as much done around here with you hanging around all the time, messing things up, asking me what I'm doing, coming up with harebrained ideas about painting the house and going on trips to Europe, and what with that whole old thing about building a dog house. You're so scattered you don't know what you're doing. Why don't you just figure out what the fuck you're gonna do, and do it. (sighs) (dogs barking) - Which one is next? - What? - Which dog are you gonna kill next? - Calm down, partner. This is the way it is. - Whichever dog you're killing next, I want to adopt. - Look, we don't ever wanna put an animal down, but we can't keep them indefinitely. - You can't just kill them, that's against animal cruelty laws or something. - Letting them breed like rabbits is animal cruelty. We get stuck with the litter. I mean at least we can place the puppies, but these dogs are too old to be adopted. - I'll take this one. - Well, you'll need to go to the office and fill out paperwork. - What's gonna happen to the other dog? - Next time someone reports a stray litter of puppies, we'll need to use the space. - What's gonna happen to this dog? - We'll need the space. - I'll take it, too. - Two dog? - Yep, both. (telephone rings) - Okay. - Hey, I've got a surprise. - Saint Thomas Hospital just called, your mom's in emergency. - What happened? - [Nurse Juan] She blacked out at the library. - Did she break anything? - The doctor still has to look at the X-rays, but from the way she's moving, I don't think so. - Then why is she here? - She displayed symptoms of stroke. - Good, you've come to take me home. - How you doin', Mom? - This is ridiculous, I'm fine. I don't understand why they brought me here to begin with. - [Denis] Mom, they want to test to see if you had a stroke. - Am I drooling? Do I look like I've had a stroke? Let's get out of here. - Just let them run a couple of tests. - This is just a lot of nonsense to collect insurance money. I'm fine, look at me. I asked you to take the baskets to the house, I mean it's not like (dogs whimper) I can really use them here. - I couldn't leave them in the car (Mary gasps). - Oh my goodness! - Oh. - Where did you get them, oh (laughs)? - The pound. You said I should get a dog. - Oh, oh my goodness, oh, hello, oh. Well, what is your name? - I haven't named them yet. Here, let me put him back. - No, no, no, you don't want to go back in that basket, do you? No, you don't. - Mom, you might have another stroke. - I did not have a stroke! I just fell down, because I probably didn't have enough breakfast. - Well, they're gonna make sure. - Oh, you're just as cute as you can be. Do I look like an old woman? - It's not an age thing. - Do I look like an old woman? Look, there's your daddy, there's your daddy, but you like your grandma better, don't you? Yes, you do, yes, you do. - Okay, okay. - Okay, so take a picture, get your cellphone. Come on, take a picture with grandma. Come on, take a picture with grandma. Don't you wanna take a picture with grandma? Come here, come here, chi, chi, chi, chi, chi, come here, yes, yes. - All right, ready? - So come on, look, look at grandma, look, look, look over to your daddy. (laughs) Oh you're so cute, yes you are. - Oh, listen, I was in the pound when I got the call and I rushed over, I couldn't leave them in the car. - That's against hospital regulations. - I know, here, let me take them back right now. - No! They stay. I'm the patient, right? And I'm supposed to be feeling better, well, I'm feeling better already. So the dogs stay. - Your blood pressure is lower than when you came in. Don't let the doctor see it. - Thank you. So, you can take them home when you take me home. - I'm afraid you'll be here overnight. - But I'm fine, really. - The doctor's keeping you for observation. You might've had a transient ischemic attack, it's not a stroke, but it has the same symptoms. - See, I told you I didn't have a stroke. - We don't know that for sure yet. If you wanna stay a while longer, that's fine. - [Denis] Thanks. - Mom. - Hello, Milosz (kissing smack). Look, both of you are making such a big deal out of this. - Well I came as soon as I could. Are, are these yours? - They're ours. I adopted them. - You got two dogs? - I had to get them, they were gonna be put down. - Can you keep them in the garage? - These are lapdogs. - (scoffs) These are dogs on drugs. - I wanted them (rubs floor). - Another one of your projects, and in two months who is gonna be taking care of 'em? - The consulting hasn't worked out yet. So it's only been a few weeks, they say it takes years for a business to succeed. - You are under a great deal of pressure. - And you're not helping. - I'm trying to, Denis! Bringing dogs into the house won't. - Well it couldn't hurt, I saved their lives. (calm music) - Good morning. How are you? Good, I'mma just take your blood pressure, okay? Real quick. Give me your arm. Thank you (speaks quietly). - [Denis] Hey, Mom. - Oh, good, you're here to take me home? - I have to ask the doctor. - What do they know? I saw her for two minutes this morning, she barely looked at me. She had a flock of know-nothing interns following her around. To think they're the doctors of our future. They probably couldn't get a Band-Aid out of a paper wrapper. I'd get better care in a Third World country! - Next time you black out, we'll airlift you to Ethiopia. - I didn't black out, I just fell. (Denis sighs) Where are my grandchildren? - You don't have grandchildren. - Bring them to me. - This attack made you delusional. - You know what I'm talking about. - I can't. - Do you think I'm gonna lay around here in the hospital all day and not see my grandchildren? - Well, family visits often help patients recover. - See? - It's against the rules. - You didn't get rid of them, did you? You didn't give them away? - No, I didn't give them away. - Go get 'em. - Mom, I have a job interview this afternoon. - Oh, good, then they can stay with me. - I'm not supposed to. - Do something nice for your mother for once (sighs). - Oh, please. All right, guys, come on. Come on, come on, I'm running late, we gotta go, into the basket, okay? Be good dogs, into the baskets, come on, come on, come on. Come on, please, I'm running late, come on, guys. There we go, there we go. Come on, please. No, you all okay? There we go. Okay, let's go, we're gonna visit grandma, you ready? Okay, here you go, there you go, here's a treat for you. All right, let's go, guys. Okay, ready? Let's go deliver to Mom, oh, come on, good boy. Ready? - Congratulations, Denis. You got the job. - That's great. - You're gonna be the company's liaison with our clients, the go-to guy, the public face of our company. - [Denis] I'm excited. - I just have to meet with two more people, before I can officially offer (telephone rings) it to you. - Who do you need to meet with? - That's just two other candidates I'm interviewing, it's really just a formality. - If I've already got the job, why do you need to interview them? - Well, Denis, you know, I've got to cross the t's. I'll let you know by the end of the week. - Thanks. - Denis? - Yeah. - (sighs) Do you have dogs by any chance? - Yeah, just picked them up at the pound, should've done it a long time ago. - It's terrific. (sighs) - Ah, he's a little fire hydrant this one. - He just can't control it, that's all. He's my little fire plug, yes he is, you're my little fire plug. Can't control himself, isn't that right, you're just a fire plug, yes you are. - I got it. - You got it? - He said I'll be the company's representative at all their client meetings. - When do you start? - He'll send me the details. - So is it a cut and pay? - This is better than my last job. The pay's a small cut, but in time I'll be up for a raise and the annual bonus will make a big difference. Mom, it's 100 degrees out, you're not gonna put that on. - Yes, but it'll be winter and we don't want his binky to get cold, do we? No. - Mom, they're dogs, they can take it. - (gasps) Don't say that in front of my grandchildren. - Aren't you taking it a little too far? - We should get a picture, use your cellphone. - Ready? - Look. - She pays more attention to the dogs than me. - I know the feeling. - No, tell me how you really feel. - "How was your day today, Milosz?" Oh, it was great, thanks for asking. "What you do?" Oh, not much, just organize a massive political rally on the Capitol steps, got interviewed by The Times, did the laundry, cleaned up after Fire Plug, twice, picked up your mother and the dogs at the hospital, brought them here, entertained them till you got home, late, oh, and the water pitcher shattered because our psycho neighbor did a 21 fucking gun salute and I dropped it. - I had big news. - And I'm happy for you. (sighs) I really am, but in your revelry can you just take a moment to pay attention to me? - Can we talk about something other than peak oil or environmental doom and gloom? - I do not talk about doom and gloom. - Yes you do. Every conversation leads back to some conspiracy about the end of the world. We're running out, okay, we get it, everybody gets it. We may not talk about it every waking minute, but we know. Shit. What the fuck? - What is it? - I don't fucking believe this. I didn't get the job. He told me I had it, we had a handshake deal (Milosz sighs). "Thank you for meeting with me, "we're going in a different direction." - Yeah, well, that's corporate America. - What am I gonna tell Mom? - That you didn't get the job. - She's gonna go nuts. - She didn't care so much when you told her you got it, I don't think she's gonna get excited when you tell her you don't. - She'll make a big deal about it, like all the other mistakes I've made. - You didn't make a mistake, they hired someone else. - Getting this place, leaving state to go to college, buying that car. Getting these dogs is probably the first thing that she thinks I did right. - Ha. (slams books shut) (loud chirping) (crow caws) - It's my life, not hers, I'm not gonna put up with anymore, she likes the dogs so much, she can get her own dogs. (crow caws) (dogs barking) - We're not open to the public right now. - I'm here to adopt another dog. - Come back tomorrow. - What are you doing with that dog? - They give each other diseases if the cages get overcrowded. I can't keep the pens clean as it is. - I'll take it. What's wrong with it? - Other than being old, nothin'. We have three other dogs no one wants. - I'll take 'em. All four. (rifle is cocked loudly) (loud gunshot) I've got a surprise for you. - What? - You're gonna love this. - What is it? - Surprise! (dogs barking) - You! - My goodness. Where did all of these dogs come from? (dogs whimper) - Oh. - The pound. - Well, you're not gonna adopt all of these? - No. - Oh. - Because we got them for you. - For me? No, now, no, no, no. What am I gonna do with all these dogs? Stop that. - You love dogs so much. - Well, I loved yours so much because they were yours and I didn't have to feed them. - You have the giant yard, they'll love it (intense music) at your place. - I don't have (mumbles) for these dogs. - Are you okay? - Mom? She's having an attack. (Mary mumbles) - Can you hear me? - Yeah, I need an ambulance. (ambulance sirens wailing) (sad music) (life support machines beeping) Have you found out anything yet? - The doctor will come in and talk to you. - How long till she comes out of it? - She had a blood clot causing severe blockage, it's too early to know. Can I get you a chair? - Nah, I'll just sit right here. I did this to her. This was my fault. - You didn't do anything to her. She had a stroke. She coulda had it when she was at home and no one was around. At least the paramedics were able to get to her when they did. She's gonna be fine. - I shouldn't have gotten her the dogs. - (chuckles) She loves those dogs. It was a funny joke, you really got me going, I, I, I thought you were serious. When you have to take 'em back? - They aren't going back. - We can't afford to keep those dogs. - What do you want me to do with them? - It doesn't matter. (intense music) Hey, what are you doing? - Which one? Which one? - Have you gone crazy? - [Denis] Which one can't we afford? - Stop it. - You can't! - Why not? I take 'em back to the pound, they'll kill 'em. They'll kill all of 'em. - Stop it. - Which one? - Stop it. They can stay. For now. (Denis slams rifle down) - I'm going back to the hospital. - Good, I'll fix us something to eat. You have time to take a shower. - I don't want to. I need you. (dogs barking) Don't give up on me. (optimistic piano music) (life support machine beeps) - We've run a battery of tests and she has total necrosis of the cerebral neurons. - What are you talking about? - The blood clot deprived her brain of oxygen for an extended period. There is no longer any brain function. - Are you, are you saying she's brain dead? - Yes. - What if the tests are wrong? What if there's been a mistake? - We'll need you to fill out some paperwork to discontinue life support. (sad music) (loud chirping) (crow caws) - Your dogs are barking a lot. - Sorry about that, they're dogs. - At least they don't wake you up at 6:00 a.m. every morning. - Sorry to hear about your mother. - She's in a coma, they don't know if she'll get better. - My son was on life support for a long time. His body grew weak, till I didn't recognized my son anymore. (sad music) - I didn't know. - They gave me this flag, they could keep the damn thing if they'd just give me my son back. - That's you, yes it is, with Grandma. (Milosz sighs) (dog breathes rapidly) This is really hard. - I know, baby, I know. Come on, you always gotta be the center of attention. (sad music) - Mom really took to him. - I know, baby, I know. - I have to make the right decision. - Denis, she's gone. - They say some people wake up from comas 20 years later. - She's not sleeping. She's left. (Denis sobs) - I can't just, it feels so abrupt. - (sighs) I know. What will be will be. - I just wanna turn back the clock. Oh my god (Milosz laughs). - Oh, one more trite saying and I'm gonna get out. - Into every life, a little rain must fall (both laugh). - Oh, no wonder people say that shit. It's true. (Denis cries) (life support machine beeps) - Mom, it's me. I don't know if you can hear me or not. I've tried so hard. For once, you're gonna have to trust me on this. - She got a kick out of you bringing in dogs. - Yeah. - Made her really happy. - Yeah, yeah. Is there paperwork I need to sign? (kissing smack) (intense music) (loud slap) (scary music) Mom? - Oh, Jesus. - Are you real? - What do you think? - We just buried you. - I'm proud of you. You made the right decision. - Do what I had to do. - That's my boy. Now, Denis, don't waste the money I left you. Do something good with it. - Yeah, okay, I will. - Okay, the next time you call me, put on some clothes, I am your mother. - Did I call you? - I'll always be with you. - Mom? - [Milosz] Denis? - Did you see her? - See who? - She was right over there, I was just talking to her. - Okay, honey. I'll fix us some supper. (sighs) - I think Erin and Jesse are back together. - Yeah, they both look great. - I don't know how many times (chuckles) they've broken up. - Yeah, with their history it's more like they take relationship vacations. - I couldn't handle breaking up with you. - Let's don't. - Deal. (dog whimpers) - Especially (chuckles) now that we have such a big family to take care of (laughs). - Yeah, (chuckles) this is a lot. - [Milosz] Hey, we eat off those plates. - I'll wash the plate. - It's uncouth. (dogs sniff loudly) (laughs) Well, at least they haven't lost their appetite. - [Denis] No. - Do we have to keep all of them? I mean, isn't there somebody somewhere that wants one? - I saw someone giving away dogs next to the coffee shop. I could try that. - There you go. - But I'd wanna make sure they go to good homes. - They're dogs, how good of a home does it have to be? - Better than Mom's. (Milosz chuckles) - What you got? - A dog. - Oh, is it a puppy? - Ah, a little bit older. - Ah, well we're gonna get her a puppy on her next birthday. - Oh, this dog would be better than a puppy. He's already housebroken and very gentle. A puppy will tear up your furniture, be too rough with your kid. - Well, it is kinda cute. - He's a doggy (Grandma Morgan and Denis chuckles)! - What are you asking for it? - He's free to a good home. - Oh, well, can't you keep it? - He belonged to a family member who just passed. - No, I'm sorry. Well I certainly didn't come here to get a dog. - I want it. - Ah now (chuckles), what are you gonna do with it when you get tired of playing with it? - I'm gonna give it back! (Grandma Morgan laughs) - Now we couldn't do that. We'd never find this guy again. We could just let it go in the woods. - On the other hand, maybe this isn't the right dog for you. - No, we'll take it off your hands. - No, really, why don't you wait till she's a bit older? - I don't know if I like you telling me how to raise my granddaughter. - Oh, I wasn't doing that. - I mean, what do you think, I'm an unfit grandmother? I guess you think you're just like her father, and you think I'm gonna let her watch too much TV. - No, really, really, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you, this is not the right dog for you, okay? - I'll bet you're a perfect father. I bet you have all the answers. - I didn't mean to offend you, sorry. (Grandma Morgan scoffs) (dogs barking) Those dogs I took last week. My mother died. - Oh, hey, I'm sorry. - Yeah, it was quite a shock. Those dogs were for her. I don't need them now, I was hoping I can bring them back. - Oh, boy, no, no, no, really, I'd rather you didn't. - I know you have a lot of animals here, but I can't take care of them. - New county policy, any dog that's here than more than a week gets gassed. I mean, you can leave 'em here, but I'm gonna have to put him down. - You're kidding. A week? - If the country commissioner had it his way, he wouldn't even let us keep 'em overnight. - [Denis] Why? - Budget costs, cost to feed 'em. - That's worse than before. - Yeah, and you know what? I can't do anything about it. This isn't why I took this job, I mean, I have two dozen animals to destroy. - Not anymore you don't. - Where did these dogs come from? You left with four, you came back with, how many are there? - We've already got six, what's another 20? - We cannot take care of every dog in the county. - Yes, we can. And we will. The county can't keep 'em anymore. We're their only chance. - [Milosz] Let 'em take 'em to another shelter. - It's tough all over. We have the land, I have the time. I'm doing it. I'd like your help. - They're gonna eat us out of house and home. - I have an idea. I was thinking that since me bringing dogs always made my mom feel better, then maybe other patients would enjoy a visit from a dog while they're here. - [Nurse Juan] I don't think the doctors would go for it. - Go for what? - Oh, when my mom was here, I used to bring in a dog to make her feel better. I was thinking that maybe other patients would benefit from that as well. - Dog therapy, they're doing it at some of the major institutions. - They are? Well, I'm caring for a group of dogs that we rescued from a pound. These will be very gentle with children or seniors. - Studies have shown significant benefits. So long as the dogs are clean, there's no harm. - I think there's a policy regarding animals. - How can you guarantee they won't bite? - These are very loving. - We can get the Patient Care Committee to address it. - [Denis] I brought one with me. - Aww. I'll talk to the board of directors. The only problem is the hospital doesn't have funds for this sort of thing. - But I know someone who does. - [Marty] Have you heard from Dr. Obacher? (telephone rings) - No, no, not today. - Denis. Hey, it's a. Well, how are you doin'? - Great. Getting canned by you is the best thing that coulda happen. - Oh. How? - You felt a little guilty about doing it, didn't you, Marty? - Well, no, I didn't-- - Now you could make it up to me. See this dog? - [Marty] Yeah. - The animal shelter's about to kill it unless someone steps for it to keep it alive. - Well, why doesn't somebody just adopt the dog? - Do you want a dog? - (chuckles) Oh, I see where this is going. Well, I, you know, I would love to, but you know, we can't have dogs in my place. - But you can be its corporate sponsor? - [Marty] Corporate sponsor? Never heard of a corporate sponsor for a dog. - Lucky for you this is a hospital therapy dog. She visits children stricken with terminal illness. Okay, imagine what it's like to see this little girl with tubes in her arms, barely breathing, suddenly jump for joy when this dog comes into her room. And the parents, the parents are in tears to see their little girl so happy. It's an experience they never forget. With tears in their eyes and camera in hand they see the company logo on the bandana around the dog's neck, "This therapy animal sponsored by." Would you like the name of the company there? (dogs barking) - How much? (happy music) - Come on, you guys. Come on, go away, go away. (sewing machine clicks) Go outside, go outside. (dog whining) - That didn't hurt, did it? (speaks quietly) (dog whimpers) - What? You want some of this? You want some of this? (laughs) Here you go. Just don't tell your father. - Hey (laughs). Daddy's home. - [Man] Growing, if President Grimes will be tried, get something (mumbles). (speaker is drowned out by music) (dogs barking) - Hey. - [Denis] Do you have any I need to take? - All of 'em, county's shutting this place down. - You're kidding? - No, since you started taking all the dogs I was gonna euthanize, the county thinks we no longer have an overpopulation problem, so they cut my job. - Are they nuts? - It's all politics. I guess it's just as well. I mean, I took this position to help animals, not kill 'em. - I need someone to do hospital visitations while I recruit volunteers. Come work for me. - Hospital visitations? - Yeah. And we need to start a campaign to convince people to fix their pets, stop the out of control breeding. - Good luck with that. - See what you think of this. - [Woman] Awesome. (beautiful piano music) - I love you, Son. - Nasturtium's for patriotism, red poppy's for consolation. (enthusiatic applause) - It's my pleasure to present the highest honor and recognition of civic pride, for taking action with no second thoughts and jumping in to save I don't know how many animals, and bring joy to I don't know how many people, I'm deeply honored (chuckles), (audience laughs) and they're happy to present this award to you, Denis. (enthusiastic applause) (Denis is drowned out by applause) (audience laughs) - Thank you. - You're welcome. - I really didn't expect this. A lot of people helped and I wanna thank you all. You've been really wonderful, I couldn't have done this without you. But there's one person who made this all possible, someone who I never got the chance to thank, someone who watched over me, someone who is a real angel for me. Didn't always agree with me and I didn't always do the right thing, but I owe everything in my life to you. (audience laughs) - [Woman] Come on. (audience applauds) - Thank you, Milosz. (Denis is drowned out by applause) And we're gonna need your help to watch over the ranch because we're taking a three week vacation to Italy. (Milosz laughs) I already bought the tickets, (speaker is drowned out by applause) Thank you. (happy music) (men cheer) (man mumbles) - Waterfall! - Waterfall! - Waterfall! - Waterfall! - Denis. (men scream) (man laughs) (speakers are drowned out by music)
