Oh, street survival. Street survival, that's what it's all about. Being a skateboarder isn't just about going skateboarding, it's all the other things around it as well. 80%, 90% of skateboarding is not skateboarding, generally, most of the time. Certain cities in America and Australia have already banned skateboarding from their streets. They are dangerous. I think people in the UK are quite intimidated by groups of people in, you know, hoodies. But skaters aren't like that, you know. We're going out to skate and use the city in a different way. We're bringing life to the spaces that are pretty dead. A lot of people just didn't understand it because it's not national, it's not put in front like football or rugby. Now skateboarding has been announced to make its debut as an Olympic sport at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The skateboarders they have chosen on the UK team, how different their styles are, are completely right. These are the best skateboarders in the country right now. You skate, you come home, you eat dinner, you go skate at 10 or 11, skate till, like, three in the morning. They were like, "You can't just skate your way through life." With the Olympic thing, they're now, like, super-ecstatic about that. I just think that's funny, 'cause to a skateboarder, it's not proper, it's kind of the reverse. The general consensus right now is that the Olympics will have quite a negative effect on skateboarding as a whole. When I found out about the Olympics, I was scared that the Olympics, they would, like, divide skateboarding and take the soul out of skateboarding. On a global stage, the UK's still a little bit behind. In the UK, skating definitely has its own identity. Skateboarding in the UK is, like, just very loose, very aggressive. We don't have athlete aspects in our skateboarding. People were like, "Oh, you were in California? Why... Why would you move back?" you know? If you see the weather forecast and you see it's raining for the next four days, it's like your heart sinks a little bit and you're like, "Oh." We are not in California. Hello. Beckett, cup of tea! Changes pitch with the water as well. Brilliant. The little things, eh? Beckett, your tea will go cold. Poor tea. I'll have to drink it. When you find skateboarding, it just fills you with excitement. Everything, like the smell of skate stickers and magazines. One of the really exciting things about skateboarding is just, like, flow. You lose everything. It's like you're losing your ego, you know? You're not thinking about anything, you're just doing these things and that's, like, a really beautiful state to be in. I don't know that I was the best at meeting people, or just, like, feeling comfortable in social situations, but it's given me, like, something solid within me that makes me able to deal with those things so I can be comfortable. I've learned every lesson in my adult life, and most of my childhood, from skateboarding. Yeah, it's weird, it's like you're floating, but it's a bit... It's fast as well, it's... Especially as a kid, you just feel invincible and then, as you get a bit older, you start to realize, you know, you're not invincible, but then, it's like, you know, you can push your body to crazy limits, do insane tricks and stuff like that, and skateboarding is endlessly creative. That's why it never gets boring. Skateboarding is definitely self-love. Uh, it's a banjo and I've been playing it for, like, three years, more or less. But, yeah, it's really fun. It's, kind of, one of the things I'm glad I discovered, 'cause it helped me, like, find a bit of time to spend doing something that wasn't skating and wasn't as physical. But still gave you the same sort of satisfaction and outlet. I love skating 'cause it's all I ever really wanted to do. Yeah, when I saw someone on a skateboard for the first time, I was like, "I really wanna do that." And they weren't even standing on it. They were just rolling across on their belly. It just looked really fun. When I first moved in here, I didn't wanna end up, like, having to, like, clear up my brother's shit and clear up my own stuff upstairs. So I ended up moving into the cupboard as a result of that, when I was, like, 16 or something. And it was quite cozy, it was really nice. This is what it looks like now. But now it's just storage again. So, yeah, that's that. I had, like, a... like, a Japanese futon mattress. it was really... It was, like, perfect shape for it. It had a light as well, but I, like, kicked it out... actually kicked it off the wall in my sleep at one point. It's all fucked now. To be fair, I mean, like, the area I lived in was right next to an estate called Monkwick and that place has always been pretty sketchy. Especially, like, skateboarding down a street like that. You can, like, bump into people and they did not like you, like, skateboarding there, even if they were kids, they'd just heckle you or try throw something at you sometimes. Like, how you conduct yourself in town on a night out is very important. And you learn that very quickly, like, growing up skating. It's not just drinking, but loads of other things, like judging people's character and all sorts of different ways to avoid getting yourself into trouble. I think the hardest challenge at first was, like, money. Not having the ability to get a board when you needed it. But I'd get one for my birthday and skate that until it was absolutely not even really recognizable as a skateboard anymore. Here's Sam Beckett, he's sitting in 11th place trying to best that 48. Got the bronze medal last year, so he has been on the podium... I didn't know that I was gonna be a professional skateboarder. I guess the dream is that you can make money doing what you like, that you get to skate forever. I am part of the Tony Hawk Pro Skater generation, like, those games had blown up. - Let's go. - What? I think what really kicked it off was, like, just the UK vert scene. There were older dudes that had, like, a really good community of vert skaters. And that is the end of the session. Over to the rollerbladers. I didn't feel like I was trying to go somewhere with it, we were just really just doing it a lot. Like, we were just going skating all the time. And there was, like, certain brands that were looking to sponsor people and I was in the right place at the right time and it was, like... gained momentum like that. Did that! I was pretty much 18 when I moved to California. So, it's, like, coming up on ten years that I've had a base out there and stuff. Basically, I hurt my knee at a mini-ramp contest and I figured if I wasn't gonna be skating for the next nine months, I would want to be back in the UK, like, where I'm from and my friends and family. Because all the people that I know in California kind of skate, and it's, like, if you're not skating, it's quite hard. Like, I've been traveling constantly for that time, you know, like... constantly going to events, constantly being in the States. And, I think, before I hurt my knee, I realized I hadn't been in one place for more than, like, a month or two months at a time. The life that someone like Sam lives is... looks quite glorious, doesn't it? And he gets to travel everywhere all the time and skate all these incredible places. I don't really make much money skating. So, I have to have a normal job. But at the same time, like, I'm still in Nottingham 'cause I've traveled so much and that's made me appreciate my hometown and appreciate that, you know, life is pretty similar all over the world, no matter where you are. There's some trophies. All crap really. Just on the shelves. They are, uh... Nepalese festival flags. We were in Nepal and India. We went with a skate charity called Skate Nepal. Went to visit the skate communities there and we helped them out. Yeah, they put these up around Nepal when the festivals are on. Guess they're a good omen. But, yeah, I'm very grateful for traveling and having a home and being able to balance the two. And, yeah, maintain a relationship and stuff. Like, I love having my house here with Chloe, it's the best thing ever. Yeah, all that stuff is very important... as well. Done. Now, skateboarding will be making its first appearance as an Olympic sport. Skateboarding today is a multi-billion dollar sport, now headed to the 2020 Summer Olympics. What this is is an opportunity for the sport of skateboarding to grow around the world and for us to communicate and engage with skateboarders around the world. Once skateboarding was announced in Tokyo, we spoke with UK Sport and they said, "What do we have out there, what do we have?" And all we really kind of had at the time was the knowledge that Sam Beckett had won an X-Games gold in vert and he had skills and the ability to do really well. We looked at Alex deCunha, who had been traveling Europe, skating in all these different skate comps and getting really good results. The other two that were really noticeably traveling and going to events and doing really amazing tricks were Alex and Jordan, Alex Hallford and Jordan Thackeray. Of course, with Skateboard GB, we were able to get them some money to help them travel to the events and also their own team manager to help deliver that. Whoa! So, the role as team manager, it was quite unknown what it would mean. When you get to this level of skateboarding, like, mentorship and guidance and support and looking after your people is just a massive part of it. Sam Beckett was an interesting character to try and, like, be involved with. He'd done so much in skateboarding, I thought, how can I help somebody who's won a gold medal at the X-Games, or had basically been the first person to do a 540 in the country, how do you help someone like that? Like, it's not about... it's not just about technical things, it's not just about, like, say, data or spreadsheets or... or trying to teach somebody how to do a trick, it's just by caring, just be there for them in the way they need you to be. Can we get Alex or Sam or Jordan better physio support, can we get them better mental health support and how will that actually enable their lifestyles and actually how will it help them grow as people, not just as Olympic skateboarders. We're just trying to get a bit more funding to help us with practicing for the events, 'cause, you know, there's not really any bowls in the country that are of that level, so, it does make it a bit difficult for keeping up with some of the other dudes, 'cause they go home and they've got ten bowls to choose from that are as big and as gnarly as the qualifying events. The only reason me and Alex and Sam have got anywhere with skateboarding is 'cause we've left the UK and traveled around to other places. Where did skateboarding come from? When did skateboarding arrive in England? How? Skateboarding, you know, really started out in California on the back of surfing. It was this thing that was created because a lot of the surfers were waiting for waves. Someone had the brilliant idea of, like, trying to emulate the surf moves on the street. People that were out there visiting would then bring skateboards back to families and then, like, certain kids would get these skateboards and try and skate. That was the beginning of skateboards coming into England. So, it was like this new thing, everybody was investing in skateboarding. Like, the UK, like, Sports England, or whatever it was at the time, it became this huge, you know, like, craze. And then the BBC got hold of it. The Southbank, with its worldwide reputation for pioneering in the arts, introduces a new kind of art form, but one definitely more suited to the outside rather than in. They called it skateboarding, and it's the nation's fastest growing craze amongst the youngsters. And then it was crazy. It ended up in all kinds of shops. Booths were selling skateboards. Any little shop was cashing in on this skateboarding, you know, fad thing. Skate parks were built in the '70s here in the UK, off the back of, you know, having this huge explosion in the media and it being really popular. The skateboarders of Luton queued for hours today, all keen to be the first to demonstrate the latest attraction of an open-air swimming pool in winter. The pool manager said to me that they'd been racking their brains for years to think of a way of using the pool in winter. And what do you all think of it? - It's fantastic. - Really good. It's gonna improve our skateboarding a lot. To give you an idea of how big skateboarding was in those days, you could afford a five-story building that was dedicated to skateboarding opposite Harrods. So, I got a job there. On a more ambitious note, promoters from America have been here too. They're anxious to encourage skateboarding in as many countries as possible so that it'll become an Olympic sport. A consideration which could help put pressure on the British sports promoter to provide facilities and training for our obvious skateboarding talent. We're at Spit and Sawdust in Cardiff. And we're having a little session on the brand-new vert ramp. They did a fundraiser on the ramp, like, uh... about a month or two ago, to try and get it built, and people chipped in really, really quickly, got it built. Come up out of nowhere, more or less. Yeah, it's gotta be like the quickest, I've seen, like, from when they were like, "Oh, we want to get a vert ramp," to having all the money for it, and it being up. Only took them, like, ten days to put it up, so... This is the closest I've ever lived to a vert ramp in the UK. Which is pretty good. It's still about five hours away from where I live. Yeah, I do miss the lifestyle that I was living in America. We've got a good crew that do skate here. Seeing, like, how stoked they are on seeing their improvement has actually give me loads of motivation and energy, although the level's quite different to being in the States. Going to the States, where people do it every day, and then you can skate with people every day on, like, amazing ramps, it's really much easier to get to a level, you know? Whereas, then here, if you're like... if you don't have a good crew and you're waiting for people to finish work and they go, like, once a week, or twice a week, it's, like, you're not really gonna improve so much, you know? And I've probably, like, lost a load of stuff as well, from living in the UK, like, not skating every day. But now, it's like... I feel like it's coming back a bit. For sure, bruv. - Yeah. - Sam's back with it. It's coming back a little bit, yeah. Yeah, definitely. It's like, you've just got to remember, yeah, these are the best skateboarders in the country right now. When I got asked to be part of the team and travel to all these events, and see these places, and hopefully try and inspire people, I couldn't really say no, when the... Yeah. Yeah, it's just, uh... just got to happen, so you've got to go with the flow, haven't you? And, uh... Oof, playing the guitar? It's just like a "why not?" kind of thing. You know, like, the opportunity's there, and especially with the crew of people that are doing it right now, like, Alex, Jordan, myself, they're, like, my friends, and to get to go and travel with those guys was kind of the biggest draw for me. Next up, we've got Alex Hallford, his magic. Skateboarders from across the world will go through a qualification process, travel around the world to different countries, try and secure points, basically, so they can get to the Olympic Games. Yeah, he is one of the funded skateboarders by UK Sport's Aspiration Fund. He is really looking to try and qualify for Tokyo. Oh, my word, that was incredible. The qualifying process is pretty nuts. They've just got... yeah, as many events as they can squeeze in and they're kind of all getting ranked on the Olympic... on the Olympic... What would you call, like, scoreboard, shall we call it? - Oh, he's... - That was amazing. He is stoked on that. So, 80 people can qualify for the Olympic Games in Tokyo, 40 women and 40 men, across two disciplines. So, we've got park and street. I mean, we did just see there, Ben, 347 points. Oh, damn, a clear leader. So, for it to be in the Olympics is kind of, like, it's a question mark in my mind. It's about how are you gonna go about judging something properly with a category and a criteria for skateboarders? It's, uh... it's something that's, uh... it's basically putting skateboarding into a box. It's not like a race, or like, a point scoring competition, like that, not on its own actual nature anyway, it's not like football or basketball or pool or anything like that. You don't go to a skate park and say, "Oh, yeah, this is the winner of today. This is the winner of the session." It's not like that. It's like, who's having the most fun, is pretty much the winner at the end of the day. Pretty much everything that I've seen come out of it with me involved, is like, "This guy's dream to be in the Olympics." And it's like, people want a good story, you know, they want, like, the struggle of some kid from wherever to do this thing, and... From my point of view, it's never been something I really took seriously. And even when it was, like, becoming a real thing, I still didn't take it seriously. 'Cause I'd been skating vert my whole life, really. It wasn't vert that was gonna be in the Olympics, so, even now, I'm, like, trying to do these contests for park, which is cool, 'cause I like skating that stuff, but I've never competed in it, really. Although Sam can do some of the biggest tricks on a vert ramp, or he can do some of the best spins or flips or whatever he does, he just knows how to ride transitions, he knows how to move around a park or a ramp. He had skills that were very transferable to park, because in the bowl, there would be a vert aspect to it. Vert skateboarding's when you're skateboarding a ramp the size of your house, park skateboarding is, like, skating, like, wavy transitions and just, kind of trying to maintain a flow. It's more like a navigational sort of skateboarding, trying to find your way around different obstacles. Over the, sort of, different eras, skateboarding has changed quite a bit. Because that first one, was very much still surf based. Was sidewalk surfing, and pools and skate park simulating pools. Within the world of organized skateboarding, there were these, you know, attempts to introduce into skateboarding or layer onto it, things that could be measured. Slalom was quite a thing at first. It tended to go down a bit and become a lot more niche. And then there was freestyle which in that era tended to be regarded as, I don't know, quite fiddly. But, it's like, more using the flat ground and doing various tricks and turns and spins, you know, a lot of people used to spin, you know, like crazy. And then there were some very strange anomalies, like high jump. Which was very Olympic. And then you'd jump off your board and jump over this thing, and land back on your board. And then there was this downhill skating. People that used to ride down really steep hills in parks, and they had these big gloves and they would do, sort of, S-slides around corners and stuff like that with the gloves on. And then you've got your full pipe skateboarding. So, it's lots of kick, turn, kick, turn, kick, turn. And little airs, little early grab airs and things. And in the '80s, the full pipe then started to become half pipe with flat ground because it was too quick, so someone decided it's too quick to just keep going like that, so let's extend the flat bottom and it gave you time to, you know, catch your breath, you know, relax your muscle for a moment and then pump. You know, so then that changed everything, and that, sort of, then became vert skateboarding. And then we see another transition which is the vert stuff starts to change a little bit, as in mini-ramps appeared. Which suddenly make the whole thing much more accessible and this very much coincides with the beginning of the new boom. When ollies started to happen, that then changed everything, you know? Because it was, like, doing things without using your hands. You could just use your feet to get off the ground, whereas before you'd grab the board and you'd hop, you know, if you could find any kind of kick, you know, any kind of bank or anything like that, you'd get air. Then street skating, sort of, blew up from there. Street, for me, was just absolutely magical, because that really blew it all wide-open, that everybody could do it, everywhere. I think it became a bit diverse, I think, certainly geographically. Still not gender-diverse, it was still largely male at that point. Skateboarding is now a part of the Olympics. And we never ever thought it would be. I don't know how it's gonna work, you know, in terms of skating for countries, uniforms and all these things. This is a whole weird world that we've stepped into. Some of the other countries, they have pretty strict, like, regimes as to what the kids are doing and how they're training and how they're treated, you know, by their managers and stuff at these events which is, like, quite a hard thing to see. But you can see, like, how that would happen in gymnastics or whatever. It's crazy that a lot of the teams show up in uniforms already at hotels and stuff like that. You see them all fully rock up with, like, Chile or USA or something written on there. Yeah, it's crazy. You see a lot of team managers that have, like, flags with them and stuff like this. In those early days, it was not a healthy lifestyle thing. And the competition aspect of it, I feel, although there were lots of events and contests, which were actually just more seen as a way of focus, semi-social, almost, you know, the notion that somebody would actively train or weight train or do something of that type didn't sit well with that culture. Like, not taking care of your body was almost, like, promoted to a skateboarder for a long time. Some of the lifestyles people lead are definitely not... don't have longevity to them, you know? A lot of the time when you stood on top of a ramp, even though you're having fun with all your mates, you're having some sort of internal mental battle with yourself about how to get yourself to do a trick that you haven't done before. And it takes a long time to be able to learn how to zone your head out completely. I still can't do it every time, it takes a lot for me to be able to do it. That's why I used to drink and skate a lot, because your brain turns off when you drink. So, I'm skating and I've got more confidence because I'm not thinking as much, but through not thinking, I'm able to do stuff I can't even do. But then also, you're drunk, so when it goes wrong, you're not aware that it's gone wrong, so your reflexes aren't up, so you'll just wipe yourself on the floor and won't protect yourself properly, so I had to stop doing that as regularly. I mean, we all know there's benefits of, like, being healthy and fit. Like, it doesn't matter what part of life... whatever you do, whatever sport or just general day to day... the healthier you are, the better off you're gonna be, we all know that. I think the thing with skateboarding is that we haven't ever really trained on the side, your skateboarding is your training. I don't know, for me, I couldn't just be an athlete or something like that, I need more in my life. I actually have never really taken my body seriously. I eat pretty good, and I'm quite into, like, trying to stay healthy and looking after my body, but really, like, there's people that are, like, athletes, they're actually doing that all the time, you know? Like, it's becoming very, very athletic, the way people are doing their tricks now. Everyone's going as high as they can, as long as they can on the grind, and as fast as they can. And jumping, like, as far as they can on the gaps. Yeah, it's becoming more taxing on your body as a result of that. All right, man. They've not had people telling them what they needed to do, or having to be part of a club or had to do any of these things. I'm also conscious that they're adults, I don't want to... I'm not gonna try and call them every day to make sure everyone's all right. It really is about everybody's personal journey. Whatever they want to achieve, it's up to them. I have a role where sometimes you have to try and make those sort of things happen and, like say, hopefully, if I can add value to their journey, then they can help add some value to mine. Sometimes, you can feel quite lonely in the role, and that presents challenges. We don't have much money, that is the truth of it. I personally feel a sense of guilt, even though maybe it shouldn't come from me, in a sense that I want to do everything I can to help these guys, and I don't mean just to reach the Olympics, but to have a good, positive skateboarding experience along the road. And that's difficult when you've not got much to work with. I wasn't quite sure what the best way of supporting the team was with not much resource. It kind of comes back to trying to be a good person, and just caring about the people you work with. And if you do that well, I think you earn their respect. There's a new generation of skateboarders that may approach it slightly different to the ones before. Yeah, Olympics has definitely changed, like, how skateboarders are thinking of themselves. So now we actually have these opportunities to... to be called athletes. It's the essential part. The stretch! Just, like, stretch your back a little bit more. Yeah, that's it, that's it, I think that's it, you've got it. And that's why he's the TM. You can stretch anywhere. You can stretch at home, you can stretch at the skate park. Stretch in the shower. - Stretching's for everybody. - Everybody. I do want to keep myself in the best shape I can so I can be at my peak when I'm skateboarding. So, there's a lot of training. But, as far as it goes right now, it's kind of just based on me trying to eat a bit healthier, go for runs every now and then. I've never drank or done any stuff like that anyway. So, that stuff is not a problem for me whatsoever. The other skateboarders on Instagram, you see, like, their countries have provided them with, like, personal trainers and things like that. Right now, it's kind of just all on me, if I want to do that. So, I am a street skateboarder. I like all the technical sort of skateboarding with, like, the flip tricks, and, like, the spins. Stairs and rails and things like that. I like to try do tricks that happen almost as quick as possible, like, I like to try and give myself fast feet so I can land and do a trick or do a trick into a trick and do something else straightaway and just kind of mess about a bit like that, I suppose, rather than, like, the bowl skaters where they'll do the high airs and things like that, which looks amazingly fun, but I can't do any of that stuff, really. I've been skateboarding since I was six years old, so it's always been a part of my life, like, I don't really remember anything before skateboarding. Even, like, going to school, everyone always knew I was that skater kid. It used to be a thing, like finish school, run home, quick time, get changed and, like, straight out skating to the Buszy, meet all my friends there. And we'd just be out for hours every single day. Growing up in Milton Keynes, has definitely affected, like, the way I skate because my local place to skate is ledges and nothing but ledges. So, not only do we have the Buszy for that, all of our street spots, more ledges. We have stairs, and, like, handrails too, just not as many, and some of them, like, are a bit sketchy, so they're not, like, the best to learn at. The guy who got me into skateboarding, his name's Lee Blackwell. Ooh! Little Alex, as I still call him, he'll always be little Alex, I don't think he'll grow anymore. I first met him, we were on one of the Eastpak Transition tours with the Death guys. And we stopped off in a place called Milton Keynes. In the city center in Milton Keynes, they had, like, a ramp set up, like, a half-pipe. Him and his dad, just so happens they were walking through, and I was trying to launch out of the barrier, do, like, my attention-seeking bit, and, out of the mini-ramp over the barrier, and they just walked past, and I pretty much nearly killed him, nearly squashed him. And I just remember, like, being six-year-old me was like, "I wanna do that." And Alex was so taken back by it that him and his dad decided to start following us around the tour. They met us at some of the spots. And we put him on the ramp, got him on a board, and that was it, he just took off from there. Alex hasn't put a board down since, he was the most quietest little boy in the world as well, you couldn't say anything to him. He was just... Yeah, he was so timid. And now he's just turned into, not only an incredible skateboarder, but, just a great human being. Like, he's a real cool kid. Yeah, so, we have some certificates for when I did Guinness World Record shows. Alex is the youngest individual to attempt a record here on Guinness World Records Smashed. In three, two, one... Go! So the one on the left is the most no comply flips in a minute, which is, like, a trick I used to do a lot when I was younger. It's like, you flick the board into your hand and literally flip it with your hand. I got 56 in a minute, somehow. Which I was pretty surprised with myself. Tonight, Alex, you did 56. A new Guinness World Record. The other two are the most for... the most kick flips in 30 seconds, and then the most kick flips in a minute. You know, they're just super random things, like, got an email, like, "Yo, do you want to come be on our show again? Come to China, come to some place," I was like, "Let's do it." So, I think, right now, I'm ranked... I think I'm 30th in the world. But then there's also a thing of each country can have a maximum of three people, so say there's... I don't know, say there's, like, seven Americans above me in the list, only three of them actually count. So, on that list, I think I'm 22nd or something like that, so, I need to step it up a little bit and, hopefully, there's a good chance of making it through. Oh, yeah, Jordan, where are we going? Oh, we're going Brazil, baby. Yeah! The boys in Brazil! It was all very last minute. We were all, kind of, thrown in to the deep-end. Not through anybody's fault, that's just how it played out. We've got the funding and we've gone ahead and done what we can. I really enjoy traveling with Jordan and Alex. And, actually, this trip was the first time I actually spent time with Alex deCunha. And he was super sound. Everyone was super sound. Everyone was grateful to be there. Smile, Jordan. Hello, mate. Nobody's skated it yet, not a lick. Checking the coping, seems to be in order. Go on, go on. Top of the world, Jordan! Come on, brah. I think that, from a lot of people I talk to, they think, you must be going to these Olympic qualification events, they're probably not very much like skateboarding. And, actually, it's not really the case. Obviously, there's got to be a certain level of infrastructure and process in place because you're trying to get through a lot of people in a competition. There's sometimes over a hundred people entering a competition. They've got a lot of work to do to make sure that that can happen over a small period of time. But, the reality of it is, is that it's still just a bunch of skateboarders at a skateboard event going skateboarding. Next up, from Great Britain, run number two, we got Sam Beckett. You know, I'm going to these events, I want to be true to me, but I also want to do my best. I'm gonna take an international plane ride across the world, I'm not going just to, like, waste it. Adjusting to the 45 seconds has been tricky. For most of the qualifying events, we've had two 45 second runs and a minute and a half is not very long to express yourself. Your individuality needs to be part of it, 'cause that is part of skateboarding. If you're just doing the same thing as everybody else, you lose your kind of creative flair and your own direction with it. I wouldn't want Olympic qualifying to do that to me. From Great Britain, Jordan Thackeray. I always have, like, an idea of what I want to do. And then the moment my name gets called out, everything just falls out of my head. The majority of the people that make it to the semis and the finals, they can all do 540s but then it's for an audience to watch that, they're being desensitized to, like, the harder shit, just because everyone's doing it. It's more impressive to me because I know what it entails, but I'll do something that's not even that hard, but something that no one's really seen before and that will get me a similar sort of mark to something that's, like, physically way more demanding. The stuff I do, it's more like precision sort of things, so my foot needs to be in the complete right position, I need to, as I pop, I need to flick the board right to then catch it with my other foot and have my other foot ready to land exactly how I want it. There's a lot to think about. In all honesty, I don't think my style of skating really fits into the format. I don't necessarily think I'm well adapted to just doing loads and loads of tricks and runs to get better scores. If I want to do better, I should probably switch that up. To be honest, I don't know what my chances are like. If I do well in the next few events, then it's possible. Anything's possible. My first reaction to skateboarding going into the Olympics was like, "Oh, great, here we go again, it's another thing that skateboarding's gonna sell out to and sell off to." And I thought it was gonna be a really bad thing. The general consensus right now is that the Olympics will have quite a negative effect on skateboarding as a whole. I have my discrepancies about it. I think it's gonna struggle with so many rules, regulations. And also, there's gonna be a lot more pressure. It's not just about the act of skateboarding. Like, we all love going skateboarding and doing it, but it's so much more than that. If we can find a balance between being included in this Olympic world, but also retain our integrity, our culture, our values, our beliefs. There's just so many beautiful things about skating that... Yeah, normal people wouldn't know, like all the community stuff, like, you know, I can take my board to any country in the world and meet a skater and we're best mates. He'll show me his city just like if he was... I bumped into someone here, and, you know, it's like that kind of thing that, you know, when you find out about when you're properly a part of it. It's like a universal understanding between each other, that, like, you're a skateboarder, I'm a skateboarder, I've got your back and you've got my back. I am slightly worried about this new generation of skateboarders being exposed to enough skateboard culture. Boxing Day, 1977, is the day skateboarding died. Nobody was buying skateboards in the run-up to that, it wasn't a Christmas present. But as soon as it, sort of, died out in the public eye, and then it wasn't in all those shops and it wasn't, like, on TV and it wasn't in the newspapers anymore, people just had this, like, negative response to skateboarding. It's the same old story. People are always scared of things they don't really understand or know. There was this period which a lot of us refer to as the Dark Ages, there was no funding available for the one thing we believed we really needed, which was places to skate. The British skate scene, at that point, was very, sort of... very gritty, very sort of homemade, very much cobbled together out of everything that you could buy. The passion was so strong that we would do anything to skate. You know, like, literally do anything. The amount of times that we'd set fire to the floor, 'cause we'd worked that one out, like, this is the way to dry out a skate park, is to get some petrol and sprinkle it everywhere and set fire to it, literally, it will burn all the water out. So, we had all these techniques, but to the outside world, it looked like chaos. So, the Southbank is located in, like, the center of London, by the Royal Festival Pier. And somewhere in the '70s, people discovered it. 'Cause, as skateboarders, we're always looking for the perfect spot. Do the five again. And when you went to Southbank, it had it all. Because it's full of banks, just like, perfect angled banks, super smooth, 'cause it's undercover. For some reason, they really started to discourage us from skating there. And, a lot of the times, you'd turn up on the Saturday, and it's a sunny day, and you'd turn up there, and it'd be wet. I think they worked out, by watching us, that, like, when it's wet, it's not good for us to skate, and we'd slip out and fall. So, there's always been a sort of, ongoing battle, really, us and them. The punks and the skateboarders shared the same kind of, like, you know, animosity from the public. As did people of color. In terms of the public and what the government thought of all of these people. We were all in the same group. I remember, Waterloo Bridge we'd get chased, you'd have to be really careful when you got off the bus to get down into the skate area because they were like, "Oh, skateboarders," and they'd start chasing you with bats. With skateboarding at that time, it was like do or die. It was like, either you were gonna dedicate your life to skateboarding and deal with all the stick that you get from everyone, or you're gonna give into it and stop skating. And you're pressured, because everyone's like, "You should be playing football," you know, you should be doing all these other sports that they understand, and it's like, you have to really decide for yourself what you wanna do. Yeah, beautiful day, you could actually take your clothes off and sunbathe if you wanted to. It's that warm. We're close to the sun, aren't we? This is my first time on the mountain. - Is it? - No. Beautiful, we've done a bit of snowboarding. Jordan has learned to snowboard, which is awesome. Picked it up pretty quick, a few slams along the way. Skateboarding event, not snowboarding event. Don't be fooled. Air is a bit thin. We just did, uh, 700 push-ups. Just a bit of altitude training. I literally just ran up to the top of the mountain and then kind of skipped back down. Yeah, just altitude training. You can tell a lot by... about, like, conditions of forests and conditions of mountains and air conditions by different lichens that grow. This fungi is growing nicely on this rock. And there's usually two parts. And they, uh... Snowball. When they reproduce, they reproduce... they don't reproduce more lichens, they reproduce fungi and algae. Get him! So, uh, you know, then they have to find each other out and then... form something else... Basically. We are in the middle of the Swiss Alps. But, yeah, the format's really good, team contest, it's a bit more social, it's a bit more, uh... a bit more, I dunno, just fun, I guess. Not so serious. This is definitely kind of an adult contest, shall we say. There's a fair bit of drinking and a fair bit of camaraderie. Hello. I mean, this thing is just about getting everyone together and the team thing is meant to, like, take some pressure off it being a contest type thing, and it's much more about being with your friends, having fun, doing stuff together. The Lovenskate crew got a fancy apartment. Our friend Skinny had a fight with the lamp that was hanging a bit too low for his liking. So... I don't know. People just get drunk, don't they, and... piss on each other and that kind of weird stuff. He literally picked up Nico's board and fucking threw it at the window with aggression. And then he was like, "Do you think it'll smash?" I think we've confirmed that it will not. See, that's why I'm in that hotel, 'cause... my team's loose. They throw boards at windows. Uh, yeah, I'm gonna actually go and skate. LAAX, are you ready for Lovenskate? Skateboarding's heavily psychological. Makes me anxious, though, skating in front of people, you know, like when it's time to rip. I think for me, it's more the microphone. Soon as your hear someone say your name on the microphone, like, "uh!" You know, the crowd wants to watch people going nuts and showing off. Weird situation, because you're, like, you wouldn't skate like that, you know, if you were just having a session. I think it's 'cause if you go to a skate park and start showing off instantly, it's gonna bum out the people that are around that aren't the same ability as you. Like, I've definitely had sessions with people where you're really vibing on it, and then you have sessions with people when they're trying to show you something and you're, like, couldn't care less, you know? And there's a difference between sharing a session with someone or making them watch you do your shit. You've got to kill it without showing that you're killing it. Judging skateboarding is, um... is pretty hard, because it's a personal thing. 'Cause skateboarding is for everybody different. So, I like more the funny tricks, you know, like, I'd say more playing around and original things. Maybe other guys more like, "Yeah, I like these big, high airs." Alex, Alex, Alex! It was super quick, caught me off guard. I knew instantly that I'd done something. Like, I just felt it snap, you know? Uh, came home, had, like, two days chilling at home and I was, like, I'm 100% sure something's broken, 'cause I was, like, playing with my leg and it was, like, crunching, you know? So... That was the color of my foot. Pretty impressive color. Went to hospital, got an X-ray, obvious fracture in my fibula, and I'd torn some ligaments. Got my MRI checked out and then they were like, yeah, you definitely need surgery, had surgery the next day. I was in a boot for, like, five, six weeks. So, we're here at Bath University in the Sports Village. The EIS, has got a center here, English Institute of Sport. I just got out of the boot last week and Skateboard GB have kind of, like, helped me out with getting in with these guys to rehab from this injury that I've had. I mean, this is a completely new thing for me as a skateboarder. And for, I think, with Skateboard GB, they want to, um... give us the opportunity, you know, to get... to get healthy and learn, you know, and to recover from an injury, so although, like, it was a bad time to have an injury... terrible timing, um... Like, this whole process has been a really interesting learning curve and I think, for them, it's been important too, to, kind of, like, make these connections with, like, these kind of things that aren't... we don't normally associate skateboarding with. It's so much easier when you've got a little distance to go to, like, have the crutches, you know? Like, I can go pretty fast on these things. Um... But, yeah, like, my walking speed is... is pretty slow, you what I mean? Makes you, um... think about your steps, you know, like, there's a mindful... ness required like, just to walk, which is quite nice. I mean, it's... it's not nice, but I'm seeing the positive side to it. I've been sitting around for two months over Christmas, and I'm kind of like, "Shit, there's a lot of work to do if you wanna be... healthy, or, you know, an athlete or whatever. I don't know. There's a lot to be done. And I think, like, seeing these people working at this kind of level makes me realize, like, you know, how much you can be doing as opposed to, like... how much I have been doing, maybe. I don't know. They've been really helpful and friendly. Which isn't always, like, the kind of treatment that you get as a skateboarder. Yeah, obviously, we wouldn't be getting this kind of help and treatment if we weren't trying to qualify for the Olympics. The last year and a half, I was chatting about it before, have been, like, really difficult for me, like injuries and personal stuff. Just been focusing on my, like, mental health and wellbeing and fitness and stuff, and it's been really positive. Here we go. How's it going? Yeah, it's like a big playground, I guess. Yeah, we just started setting up this space as a place to do whatever creative thing it is that I want to do. When I'm not skating or when the weather's not good or whatever, it's quite hard to have a bit of a purpose, so it's nice to have, like, a space. There's a bunch of different stuff that I can, like, do at home, you know, I'm, like, working on range of motion stuff. Like, I can pretty much do it anywhere, like, I've got, like... 'cause I don't have much range of motion in my ankles, so it's just, like, increasing that motion. I've basically got this list of things that I've got to do. Some of them are pretty like, basic, so I've just got to do them throughout the day, like standing on one leg. 'Cause, like, I've got no muscle, like, control firing in my leg, so, I'm like... Just standing on one leg is quite difficult at the minute. Everyone's injured. Like, that's just how it is. Being a skateboarder, you subject yourself to living with pain for, pretty much, forever. Over the years, I've managed to fracture my wrists and... like, my knee went really weird this year, like, it just stopped working and took months and months to put the strength back on it to be able to pump again. My hips are pretty bust, actually, I've got, like, these horrible lumps everywhere now, where I've, like, repeatedly hit the... the flesh until it's, like, turned into a swollen ball that's gone solid. And because of that, I've got, like, bone fragments missing in my hips, that's what they said when they X-rayed me. A lot of skaters end up changing their tricks based around how injured they are. People are skating in completely different ways to the ways they did just simply because they can't afford to slam in that way by trying those sorts of tricks, so they learn different stuff that doesn't put them in the same danger. Still puts them in danger though, so eventually they get wrecked and have to change it again. There's not really ever been, like... thought of as necessary for skaters to be given medical care and stuff by their sponsors, that's not normally a requirement. Well, in anything I've experienced, anyway. Skateboarding is getting into the Olympics, and we don't necessarily know what it is that we're getting into, you know? It's all new for everyone involved. It'll be interesting to know, like, who is benefiting from it? Like, who's making the money off skating being in the Olympics? 'Cause there's all kinds of people coming into skating that weren't there a few years ago. I've not thought too much about it. Not that I don't care, but... it just is, isn't it? Where does the money come from? Where does it go? I don't see any of it. Skaters are completely replaceable in this industry, as well. It's, like, if you don't want to jump down that thing, or you don't want to do, like, kill yourself trying to do something, some kid will do it for free. Like, some kid will do it for some shoes, you know? If you're not skating to your 100% ability, you know some little kid down the street is gonna be, like, chasing your tails behind you, wanting that sponsor, wanting the money, and wanting that pressure. It changes over time, for sure, like what people expect of you, and especially if you're getting paid more money by someone, then they expect certain things from you. All of that stuff comes internally, I think. You know, it's very rare that there's some guy at one of your sponsors, like, your team manager's, like, "You're just not doing enough, you're just not, like... we haven't had enough pictures of you." Like, yeah, it happens. But now you've got these big brands involved, it all becomes very political, and becomes really serious, and it's like, wait a minute, we're talking about the act of riding a skateboard, there's no agency that represents skateboarders, in terms of dealing with contracts from massive corporations. We don't want this added pressure, you know? But it feels like getting sponsored now is quite a lot of pressure. Um, but, yeah, many brands have come and gone, you know, and got involved with skateboarding and then got out. And then in the Dark Ages, skateboarding was so uncool, it was unreal. It was the definition of something that went out. If you somebody wearing Vans, you looked up and knew that you would... Expected to recognize the face, because they were into skating, nobody else was. The re-emergence of skateboarding was beginning before Back to the Future. It gets popular, you know, all the waves, you know, every single wave, it's always the same. It gets popular and then certain other brands outside of skateboarding, that don't understand it, try and get involved in it. Try to make a bit of money, you know? Like, the resurgence of like Puma States, for instance, and Adidas Gazelles, it was because of skateboarders. They cost nothing. That was why we bought them, because they were cheap. And then the brand saw, like, how everyone was wearing them. And then they were like, "Oh, let's sponsor some skaters." Then Tony Hawk's Pro Skater is going around and it's blowing up the spot, and everybody's looking at skateboarding again, and then X-Games started, and then that blew up the spot as well. The whole skate look and all this stuff became very cool. We've always been doing this. Like, you know, we're here, we're the skaters. You know, the ones that you spat on when we were skating, you know, the ones that you chased, the ones that you'd swear at. The ones that you'd call the police on. You know what I mean, the ones you'd try and beat up on. We're the same people, you know, but now, it's like, "Oh, skateboarding's cool." The idea of being a pro skater seems wicked, you know? You get to skate all your life and you get paid, and that's cool. But then, that's not... realistically what it is, it's like, you get paid because the company can market you to other people. Like, realistically, skaters that are sponsored, they just advertise for a company. Like, the skate industry is a cool game, you know, it's about who's cool, who do people want to be like, who can companies parcel up their image and sell it to younger people? You can be a really good skateboarder and win lots of competitions, or make the best video parts, but it's, like, if people don't wanna be like that person, then it doesn't really work, you know, for companies. I think that has been one of the hardest things for me to come to terms with in skating, is that, like, uh... I guess, like... Maybe it's this thing that I've created in my head. But, it does feel like I'm not someone that, uh... is cool, necessarily. Like, I'm not someone that is, like... maybe setting trends or anything like that, I just... spent a lot of time skating, you know? I've definitely had some anxieties of, like, whether I'm still relevant or good enough to do this stuff. When skateboarding consumes you, or, like, is such a big part of your life, it's kind of hard to realize that there's more to life than skateboarding. And that there are certain things that don't necessarily get into, when you're not in one place for long enough, like building up a community or relationships and that kind of stuff that comes in too, and I think, realistically, like, if you're gonna do this sponsored skating thing, it's at the time when you would have been going to university and finishing school and that stuff, so that stuff kind of goes out the window. The option is either you, like, kill it so hard that you're set for life from skating, which is, like, not a good option, 'cause skating doesn't owe you anything, I think people really have to realize that. Skateboarding isn't everything, and one day, you might actually end up on the back end of skateboarding. You might just end up skateboarding for fun. And you've got to realize after that, if you don't make it as big as what you expect to in the world, you might have to take up a normal job. Face, like, everyday life, like normal people. Not just, like, skateboarders, but young men in general, like, I know people know... Yeah, there is an awareness that young men have, like, a... uh, particularly, have a hard time. Yeah, I guess the pressures aren't just there in skateboarding either. I think they're there in, like, a lot of the more extreme sports as they're now calling them. Obviously, we've recently lost one of the best skateboarders, as far as I'm concerned, and who was like a little brother for me, and a son and a brother to many others. It was weird, 'cause I don't think either of us were particularly, like, felt, like, very solid at that time. Meet up in the morning, just, like, go to Wetherspoons for breakfast, like, a cheap breakfast. I could definitely feel what he was feeling, you know, like, I heard him say it multiple times. He was just like, "I wish I had a... just a regular job. 'Cause all my mates that work, they seem to really enjoy, like, skating." He sort of felt like being a sponsored skateboarder had taken certain things away from him, like, just the ability to have, like, a girlfriend or something, or, like, that kind of stuff, because it's really hard for a lot of people to deal with a relationship that the person's, like, away every other week. Depends who you've got around you as well, doesn't it? Like, if you're... you know, for me, I'm in my hometown now, and I've got all my friends and lovely people around, but, you know, when you've moved to London or something like that and you're... you know, you might not have people around that you can really talk to, 'cause you don't know them that well. I realized that, like, the people that mean the most to you, just to see them twice a year is, like, for brief interactions, isn't really... You know, there's something missing there. This is the first, like, solid place I've had to live in a really long time. I think in the back of your mind, you just think everything's all right. You don't think of things like that at all. Like, we're just going skateboarding, everything's cool, everything's good. All right, we have our bad days and... Where you can't skate and you might go home and that's it, you leave it at that. But, uh, we just don't communicate in that sort of sense. As much as we're close as skateboarders, that's it, we're close as skateboarders. We don't really talk about each other's lives outside of that and everything, you just don't think to. You know, I think that's where it needs to change, we need to look in on each other more. Yeah, it's hard for anyone to tell someone... how to live their life, though, isn't it? It's, like, you have to kind of realize these things for yourself, otherwise, you know, you're not gonna respond to someone ordering you to do something different or... But, yeah, you have to be open yourself as well, isn't it? I think, with skateboarding being in the Olympics now, if they're gonna make it so mainstream, and I think this goes for a lot of skateboard brands now as well, you need to start looking at your skateboarders... off of the board, not just on the board. You need to start looking after them. Seeing how they are, calling up, you know, "How are you? How's your day going?" and everything like that. Just check in. Make sure that they're in a mentally stable place. Because if they're not, like, we've seen over the years, we're losing good skateboarders. Um, and I think all of that sort of thing can be avoided. If we just... Yeah. We've just gotta talk to each other. As our breaking story this evening, a third person has tested positive in the UK for corona virus. Experts say they are now not optimistic that the virus can be contained. The number people who have died now stands at almost 4,000. From tonight, you can go outside for only one form of exercise a day. All gatherings of more than two people are banned. In light of the ongoing pandemic, the IOC has announced the postponement of the 2020 Olympic Games. The government's advice is clear: you must stay at home. The camera on there, is it good quality? It doesn't look that great. Let me just make a cup of tea. Fucking virus stuff, yeah, it's really strange. When the virus thing started, I, uh, I moved to Flo, spent my time at the park, living on my own, which has been very strange as well. You know, I've lived in house shares with friends and all that jazz and never ever lived, like, fully on my own. Yeah, me and Chloe have kind of stopped seeing each other for a bit. We're still mates, but it's like, yeah, we're giving each other some space, but... Uh, it's all so much happened. Like, the days before lockdown, it was mad. Yeah, I moved into my mate Nick's house, and at this point, like, I was pretty fucking depressed. I'd been like, you know, didn't have my home, I didn't have, you know, I wasn't with Chloe. Fucking half eight, I wake up and I'm just instantly crying. Like, fucking tripping. Brush the tears off, right, let's go to the fucking gnarly spot to shoot a photo. Can you see it at all? It's like a fucking Victorian lock on a canal. Sorry, I should stop swearing. Crazy place. Anyway, I'm at the top, I'm looking down, I'm like, "Right, okay, fuckin'... it's gonna be gnarly, but you can... you've got this, no problem. Just don't hit the little fucking thing at the bottom that's tie... that you tie the bloody boats to." Pretty focused, I'm on it. Sort of channeling all this fucking sorrow. So, anyway, hit the thing, fly through the air, bounce, I'm falling into the lock, so I basically... I nearly fucking die... horrendously bad, and I'm just like, adrenaline's on a mad high, and then I, sort of, like, start realizing my hand's absolutely fucked, like, covered in blood, cut up everywhere. I'm kind of losing it a bit after that, like, for the next, sort of, 15 minutes I'm lying around at the lock just fucking in pain, sort of trying to refocus and think about, yeah, if it's worth it, kind of losing it, and, basically, I don't think I'm gonna do it, it's fuckin'... you know, I'm destroyed. So, then, uh... then, a fucking boat ends up pulling into the lock, if I'm gonna do it, it's now or never, like, it has to be now, 'cause, yeah, it's do or die. And, yeah, I fuckin' just pull it in, and ride it out and survive. They showed me the footage and then I just burst into tears at the side of the canal for an hour. Unfortunately, what's happened is that Covid's come around and it's affected skateboarding the same way as it's affected everyone. I suppose, once everything started to be canceled, there was a lot of discussion on whether Tokyo would happen. And then, yeah, looking out for the guys, working out for the team, where... where they might go next. So, pretty much every skate event for the year has been canceled. 'Cause I was still recovering from my ankle surgery, it was exactly what I needed. I guess I was worried about a lot of peoples' mental health. There's a lot of people out there that are spending a lot more time by themselves than they're used to. One of my favorite parts about living in the van has to be the bed situation. Because I'm currently parked facing the, uh... facing the east, yeah, of course, it's the east. I'm currently parked facing the east, the sun rises directly behind me. And, yeah, it's beautiful. Some nights, I sleep with the doors open and get woken by the sun, and just... Yeah, it's just lovely chillin' in here with the doors open, and, yeah, it's amazing, yeah. Get to go to sleep with the stars and, yeah, it's pretty, uh... pretty surreal sometimes. The kind of design feature that I was most proud of being able to move the bed all the way into a sofa, a single bed all the way to here, and be a double, and then, just means in the daytime, I've got all this space to run around, I can... If it's raining I can do yoga. You do worry that it's all gonna burn to the ground. Then you'll have nothing. Bedroom, living room, kitchen. In a small space. Where are my teabags? Ah, there. Having one arm is annoying. It's just so easy living in a space like this. You just don't have to worry about anything. Yeah. In a general sense, it's been a roller coaster of emotions. Yeah, I was very excited at the idea of living on the road and stuff like that. My hand was forced a little bit, but, yeah, it has been incredible. When the lockdown started, um, the park needed looking after and, yeah, I just thought that, you know, it was safe place to park my van on private land, I wouldn't get hassled from the police. I do love this place, and I figured while I'm not doing anything else, it'd be nice to put some time in here. It has been very nice. But when you're locked down trying to go through... all this other shit, just relationships and house troubles, and... yeah, the whole world stopping, and... A bit too much to handle. - Morning. - Hello. Here you go, mate. Nice knife. Ooh, Minirig. Minirig, bro. Should we get some tunes on? That's the wrong hand for that. Um, yeah, there's still lots of stuff to do. Still got to tile around the, uh... round the hob there. Fix the little holes and have a... There's another bench that goes along the back wall there where all the shoes are. And that's... I'm currently building a toilet in that. A compost toilet. So, might sound a bit gross, but there's no smell with them in there. Yeah, they're really, really good. Why everybody is not composting their feces, I do not know, because, yeah, we wouldn't need fertilizer, you know, chemical fertilizers anymore. There's definitely enough shit to go around. Am I right, Beckett? No opinion. I think it's amazing that Alex has got his place. Like, he lives here and he works here and stuff. But then I was kind of thinking, he did just spend two months here by himself. Skating's not that much fun if you can't share it with other people, so... probably wasn't as idyllic as it seemed. I have some lovely friends who are prepared to help me with my emotions. Yeah, he's all right, I'd say I'd put him up there. Top, uh... yeah, top friend of the month, for sure. Friend of the month? No, I'm joking. No, yeah, he's a good mate. Comrade in arms. With the whole deal with the Olympics, everything became a lot more relaxed and you could just skate because you wanted to, there was nothing to gain from anything you were doing other than, like, the feeling of landing it, or, like, just doing it. Hanging out with your mates. And it made me realize how much stress it puts on your mind. It is definitely not as relaxed as I was trying to make it. Even though I, like, convinced myself that there's no pressure and I don't care about really what happens. Don't even care if I do well or not. You still have, like, a pressure underneath. I've talked about it with Jordan, it's, like, this summer skateboarding's been more for me than it ever has been. I haven't had to go to events, or... There's been a lot less pressure to do certain things. The motivation is just the fact that it's completely, like... my thing. I think going back to how it feels when you're a child, and you're just skating just to do it, just to, like, connect with the activity of just doing it. And I realize that there's only the moment that you're doing it that really is important. Skating just seems to be the thing that makes me feel most alive, I guess. It's a good internal battle with yourself. Oh, skateboarding clothes. I've been filming for the next Lovenskate video, and we also spent a month filming a homage to Cheese & Crackers, called Tea and Biscuits. Over decade later, and they are still paying homage to Cheese & Crackers. That's how heavy that shit was. Two of the lightest item snacks carry that much weight for this long that they're still trying to compete with it. Jordan Thackeray made a mockery of that closet to Narnia ramp that they have in the middle of somewhere. I don't know if there's LSD in that tea, boy, but these boys' brains is open. I love it. That was, uh... that was an adventure. We were... Jordan stayed at my house for a month, and we, uh... Yeah, we came and did night shifts in this very bowl that I'm sat in now. Yeah, it all worked out really well, actually. It starts off with a little intro and there's a portal through into the magic world of mini-ramp skating, you know? Yeah, when times get hard, skateboarding is a great escape. I just, uh, definitely use it to switch off, sometimes, from the rest of the world. So, you're completely, like, in that one moment. And it's, like, not something that many things bring out of you. That sort of ability, to be away from reality completely, 'cause you're so focused on what you're doing in the present time. It was intense, you know, night shifts, working at the shop in the day, and then going home for dinner and then coming straight here till three in the morning. Yeah, every night, we'd go to Flo at about ten o'clock, and set up the little world that we made. It was grueling, the cold, you know? It's like a refrigerator in here in the winter, so, you know, having, uh... having Jordan live at my house for a month... pretty intense, probably didn't help my relationship with Chloe, either. Yeah, it's good. I like that fact that it's got cooler and everyone's stoked on that now. And, uh, it's nice to see the progress with it. But yeah, there's definitely something to be said about the connection you have when you're like, well, back when I was a kid anyway, with, like, the other people that did skate, 'cause it was just such a rare, special thing. Oh, hello, darling. I'm good, man, nice to see you. I just walked past your house, I was like, "This is where I used to fucking..." Nah, I didn't say hello. Just talked shit about... Georgia, Jordan. - Hi, lovely to meet you. - Hiya. She is excited, she's heard all about you. I'll come over for a tea, probably, later on, or something, if you want. - It'd be fucking lovely to say hello. - Pop over. Later, bro. Take care. - Good to see you. - Yeah, you too. - Take care, guys. - Lovely to see you as well. Have a good one. That's my mate Callum. We used to walk to school together, like, every day or scooter slash skateboard and all that shit. But, yeah, he'd always let me keep my board in his house when I wasn't allowed to skate by Mum. My mum was just worried for my health and safety, really, I think. Didn't want me getting influenced by, like, drugs and, like, just the bad stigma that came with skating when I was a kid, it wasn't cool. Like, everything that I've done over my life that's been kind of reckless with my body, I've been like, I know this is bad, but I'm gonna, like, wait until later on to experience the consequences and it doesn't matter 'cause I'm having fun. That's all decided to come and bite me in the ass all at the same time, in the same period of time. Which is weird, but, like, I didn't realize that that was how it went. But apparently, that's how it goes for me. So, yeah, this year, I've had to deal with a lot of different shit going on that's not really as fun as it was. And it's funny how it can just suddenly switch. And you're like, "Oh, gotta fuckin' deal with this now. Shit. Probably should have chilled out on that thing that my friends told me to chill out on." So, they pulled five of these calcified pearls out of my hip, that was this one here, that's the bit that they pulled it out of. And then this bit here, they sliced it open and they... they got rid of some scar tissue and they punched tiny little holes in the actual muscle that runs from your ass round there, down to your leg to release the pressure that was caused by them. So, basically, it's your body saying, like, "Stop, I need a break." I've got to do a lot of exercise, I've got like, fuckin', 18 exercises I've got to do, more or less every day. And as you can see, today I have done none of them. And then a couple of them are stretches. I have to do this weird crab walk as well, which I'm not gonna show you. The sponsors have been a big help with getting me fixed, I literally wouldn't have been able to do it without them. Welcome! This is my little house. My humble little house. Morning, Chloe. Oh, it's such a beautiful day, we're so lucky. Yeah, there it is. Three mugs. In the last week, maybe, we've smashed, oh, loads of mugs. Loads of plates. That can't be binned. We should pull the curtain for dramatic effect right now. This is our separation barrier. This stops us from fighting. It is chilly. Are you gonna hold my hand? Hold my hand. Yeah, we spent a lot of time together this year. This like the most, yeah. The most time ever. Yeah, it's been nice. And there's definitely no looking back at the moment, is there? Yeah, lots of new adventures. It's kind of like getting to know each other again, getting to know how to live together again. Yeah, true. Yeah, that's definitely a good way of looking at it. So much time for each other. I cuddle too tight. I don't normally get to see the seasons, to be honest, like, when I'm traveling or away. I just found these little, like, little waxcaps, orange waxcaps of sorts. But, like, in this zone, I dunno, there's just... the forest floor's like covered in mushrooms, everywhere you go, like, there's fungi, there's tiny little guys, like just down here. And then... It's kind of like, I don't know, the more you, like... stop and look around, like... it's mind-blowing how much stuff there is. But, you know, they're like... they're just like tiny little fungi, breaking down, like... breaking down all the leaf litter and twigs that fall and, yeah, so it, like, rots everything down and then you have, like, a really fertile topsoil. Little signs in nature to what's going on and it's like a little puzzle to piece together what's happening and the more you look at stuff, you realize the more there is to look at. And I kind of like that, you know, you've been walking around, I don't know, in forests and out in the countryside forever and just then you realize, like, under your feet, like, everything's happening. The more you learn, like, you realize there's so much to learn and you can, like, spend your whole life learning about stuff, and I would like to, you know? Especially after being injured, the act of skating has become, like, richer to me. Like, when I'm doing it, it means a lot more to me. Skateboarding has given me everything, and it has given me the opportunity to become who I am, you know? And I'm grateful for that. It's such a positive thing. It's fun, it's there for you and your friends, like, keep it like that. Just go out and skate and that's enough, you know? Whoa. Check this place out. This shot that you get at living, or whatever, it's, like, the most important thing wherever that kind of leads might not be the same as where I've come from, but I think, like, I'm just following what's gonna be enjoyable for me. Life's an adventure and it feels good to just be out. I think skateboarding's in good hands because the core is still very much involved. No matter what happens with the Olympics and all that sort of stuff, the underground of skateboarding, that's still gonna be the same. I wouldn't even say it divides people because once you're actually skating, everyone has their different lifestyles, but if you're at the skate park, everyone's together, just skating. People just don't like change and people are always afraid that something's gonna be taken away from them. I don't think anyone's taking skating away from anyone, you know? We are pretty fluid, you know, and things do change and, like, we've all got our own version of it. It's fine, like, as long as you get to pass that on, or show other people that, or share it with other people. What we've seen is a huge rise in participation in skateboarding, with a huge part of that being girls. The wave of popularity this time round could differ from before, it could, potentially, be more sustainable. I think we've got more facilities, we've got more infrastructure. There is more accessibility for kids now. Some of those stereotypes around skateboarding that were there before, with those barriers coming down a little bit. Oh, thank God you've got a helmet on! If you agree with the Olympics or not, I don't think it's gonna really affect your day-to-day. You're the guy skating the curb down the road, that's not gonna affect you. We're trying to do more than just go to the Olympics. This is about inspiring people to go skateboarding or to maybe find something that they didn't have or know about before. The opportunity to be able to pick something up, a bit of wood and leave your house and basically go and explore wherever you're gonna go and skate, is incredible. Well, there you go, man.
