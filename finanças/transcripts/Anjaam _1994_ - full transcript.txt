Subtitle made by Grace For your information the temperature outside.. ..is 32 degrees Celsius. On behalf of Air India, captain Prem Kumar and the other employees.. ..I bid farewell to you. I hope your journey was pleasant. Thank you. Shivani, you'll be coming today afternoon, won't you? Where? - Don't you remember? We have to go to Kavita's birthday party in the evening. Yes. I'll go home and see. - Why? If sister's health is fine, I'll come. - Okay. The rose sapling you'd given me earlier.. ..had many beautiful flowers blooming from it. Here. - Thank you. What are you doing? - I am taking the money. Don't do that. There's no money for my medicine. So what can I do about that? I don't have money for the races and you're worrying.. ..about your medicines. I've told you so many times. If you run the shop from home you don't get many customers. If you set up shop on a footpath, you'll see. All the plants will be sold in one day. You'll get your medicines and my problem will be solved too. I'm not well. You should think of something. I always think that's why I bet on the races. Just let me get the jackpot, and all the worries will be over. I'll have you operated. Brother in law. - Yes. Aren't you ashamed? Sister is ill and you want to bet on the races. What do you care if I bet or buy a horse? Don't lecture me, I'm already stressed. What stress do you have? I have a lot of stress in my head. It's been 6 months since my horse last won and I have to take care of the expenses. Household expenses, and your sister's medicine. Yes, you're the only one in the house that works. All the others just sit and eat. The bitch stands in my house and mocks me. I pay for your expenses too. My expenses? - Yes. I give you 2,000 Rs every month. Every month. Wow! Today is the 10th of the month. Where is my money? I was on a flight. And don't talk to me like that. If you feel offended... why don't you take the money out and throw it in my face. Here you are. And bring sister's medicine. You're telling me as if had also given me the money for the medicine. This is for the household expenses. If I buy the medicine, how will I pay the bills? And the grocieries? That's ok. Now I'll buy the medicine and win the jackpot too. He doesn't think of anything but the races. It's about these races all the time. Sister, why don't you make him understand? What should I make him understand? This is my destiny now. Don't blame destiny, sister. The truth is that one wrong step ruins a person's whole life. Salim, serve me my drink. - Shivani, let's cut the cake. - Sure. Salim, please bring the cake. Yes, madam. I like this number very much. Hi. My name is Vijay Agnihotri. You probably don't know... ..all the girls that here.. ..they come here thinking that I'll dance with them. But today, I have decided to give you this opportunity. Please come. Go to hell. We'll go there too but.. Get me some candles. - Quick! A very happy birthday to you. It's not my birthday. - Okay. A very happy birthday to you. - Not my birthday. Excuse me. 'Happy birthday to me.' What insolence is this? - Insolence? I thought that it isn't your birthday. It isn't her birthday too, so I thought that... I'll celebrate my birthday. You have some too. It's so good. 'Happy birthday to me.' - Mr. Vijay Agnihotri. Are you sure that it's your birthday today? - Yes. 'Happy birthday to you.' 'Happy birthday to you.' Thank you. Thank you very much. But that crazy guy mustn't have eaten a cake like that ever. - Yes. With his eyes, nose.. ..and even the ears. - Oh yes! 'Happy birthday to you.' Stop it! Stop it! - The cake was very good. Good night. Idiot! Hell! Damn it! Oh! 'The poor drummer's in a mess.' 'His drum got busted in the middle of the market.' 'He has been ruined.' 'Pray to God!' 'Pray to God!' What happened after that? When I reached there, the car was still burning. The three shops near it were burning too. Inspector Arjun Singh. Do you know what the cost of that car was? Even if you sell the burnt car as it is.. ..the shopkeepers can get new shops from it. But what about the report they've written? I don't know anything. Here give this to the shopkeepers. And this? You keep it. Vijay. This display of money that you always do. I don't like it at all. Mummy. A person shows what he has. Just look at him now. Inspector Arjun Singh. He had this uniform, which gave him enough strength to come here. And we have money... Which gives us power to shut this officer and the shop owner's mouth. Well, Mother. I'm going to the office. - Inspector? - Let's go. See you later. Mr. Saxena, what's all this? Amongst them, there isn't a single girl.. ..who can become a model of this company. Looking at these ugly faces, it seems that.. ..India has become devoid of beauty. But, sir, they're the famous models of today. I do not want a famous model, but a beautiful model. I want her. I want her. I want this girl. Sir, this is the advertisement of an airlines. Their models are air hostesses. And they don't work for outside companies. Money can make people do everything, Mr. Saxena. I want her address. Shivani, have tea. Thanks. Hello. Good morning. You? So you at least recognized me. How can I forget your face? Now you won't forget my name either. Vijay Agnihotri is my name. I'm the sole owner of Agnihotri Industries. But why did you take the trouble of coming here? To give you some good news. I've chosen you as the model for the new product of my company. So you've decided that I'll model? Yes. Mr. Vijay Agnihotri, I'm not interested. Then you must be interested in earning money? These are just pieces of paper for me. But they've such power and attraction. They can turn any no into a yes. Is it? - Yes! And if you think they're not enough, I can give you double than that. Are you so conceited about your wealth? Not conceited. I'm proud. Just as you're proud of your beauty. And you've come to set a price for my beauty? Well, you can assume that. But I want your answer. I don't have a better answer than this. I'd realized that you were a spoilt rich brat that day. But today I've learnt that you're insolent and big-headed too. Please get out of here. Fool! Sir, whom are you speaking to? She's crazy. What does she know what wealth is? She has turned Lady Luck away. You seem stupid. But you're intelligent. Sir, I'm very smart. You want a model for your company, won't you? What's the problem with me? I just have some buck teeth. But that's not a problem these days. Give me Rs.10000. I will rectify my teeth tomorrow itself. I can rectify your teeth without giving any advance. Doing good is worthless these days. Vijay, the details of my meeting with Star Exports in London.. ..are in this file. Read it. I'll read on the flight, Mother. This deal's very good. But it should be done on our terms. Don't worry, Mother. Whatever I do, I do it on my terms. Good. All the best. Bye. - Bye. 'All passengers. Attention please.' 'Proceed for the security check.' Excuse me. - Yes? Where's this crew going? They're going to Dubai by Air India flight 102. Okay, then please change my London ticket to Dubai. - Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir. This isn't an Air India ticket. I cannot change it. Okay. Then give me an Air India ticket to Dubai. Yes sir? Hi! You? - Yes, me. What are you doing here? I've come here to play cricket. Madam, this flight is going to Dubai. So I'm going to Dubai too. I need a drink. Could I get one? Sure. Yes sir? The drink should be more intoxicating than your eyes. Yes? - It should be spicy like your tongue. More intoxicating than my eyes. Spicier than my tongue. Saltier than me. Your drink, sir. Thank you. It's very good. Did you like it? It isn't possible that I didn't like it. You made it with so much love for me. Really, it's very good. Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure. Very nice. Yes sir? I want another drink like this. Exactly like this? No, this one didn't have enough salt. Greetings. - Thank you. Thank you. 'Air India announces the departure of flight AI 746 to Mumbai.' 'All passengers are requested to proceed for security check.' 'Thank you.' Please fasten your seat belt, sir. - Yes. Please fasten your seat belt, madam. - Yes. Hello. You? You've come once again? Why? Did I commit any crime? You came to Dubai on this flight two hours ago. And you're going to Mumbai now? Is there a rule in your airlines.. ..that the one who comes on a flight cannot return by the same one? Please come. I'll show you your seat. - Thank you. Fasten your seatbelt, please. Excuse me, sit down, we are experiencing bad weather. - Shut up! Didn't you hear the weather is bad? Sit down. You stay quite and sit. Have a seat, when the weather is better I'll make you a drink. I don't drink anyone's made drink. Now keep quiet and stay out of my way. What are you doing? You just dropped everything! - Oh, shut up. Who are you to stop me if a break a bottle or a glass? You...air hostess. You're here as a servant. So stay like one. You are so rude. Don't you know how to take to a lady? Maybe you're rich in your house. You bought a ticket, not us. We are here to serve you, not to take your rude behaviour. Apologize to her. Apologize to her! I'm sorry. And now sit down quietly. - I'm sorry. Sit down. Miss Shivani. Miss Shivani. Miss Shivani. Miss Shivani, I'm wounded. - Let me see. Keep quiet! It's just a small scratch. Get the first aid kit. Just keep quiet! - Keep quiet, my foot! If a person is wounded won't he scream? Careful, what are you doing? - Shut up! Now what? Miss Shivani, what kind of bandage is this? See, it has come off. Please put it on. I'm losing blood, I'll die. Please. Do you have any problems now? - No. Right. Have a nice flight. "I've a problem." "I've lost my heart." "I've a problem." "I've lost my heart." "Nobody is searching for it." "I've a problem." "I've lost my heart." "Nobody is searching for it." "Nobody tells me where I should report this." "Should I cry or laugh? "What should I do?" "Should I cry or laugh? "What should I do?" "I've a problem." "I've lost my heart." "Nobody is searching for it." "Nobody tells me where I should report this." "Should I cry or laugh? "What should I do?" "Should I cry or laugh? "What should I do?" "The one who comes in my dreams." "When will she come in my arms?" "For how long will she make me yearn like this?" "The one who comes in my dreams." "When will she come in my arms?" "For how long will she make me yearn like this?" "Wherever I turn and see." "I can just see her." "My path, my journey, she is my destination." "This weather is crazy, my desires are aroused." "Should I cry or laugh?" "What should I do?" Madam, Mr. Bhatia is selling the factory in Delhi. We'll be profited if we buy it. Okay. But I'll have to speak to Vijay. He'll return after a week from London. - Mother. Vijay, have you gone crazy? "I shouldn't cross the limits of craziness." "How shall I show her, her face in my eyes?" "I shouldn't cross the limits of craziness." "How shall I show her, her face in my eyes?" "She's the most beautiful, there's nobody like her." "Oh my God! Her attitude is lethal." "I don't know what high this is." "Should I laugh or cry?" "What should I do?" "I've a problem. I've lost my heart." "Nobody is searching for it." "I've a problem. I've lost my heart." "Nobody is searching for it." "Where should I go and report this?" "Nobody tells me anything." "Should I laugh or cry?" "What should I do?" "Should I laugh or cry?" "What should I do?" That's enough! Who's that girl? Do you remember I used to sing a poem in childhood? - Yes. 'There's a star in the sky far away.' 'I like that star.' 'Give me the star I like.' 'Mother, give me that star.' You can say that I've got that star. Now what if that star comes as the daughter-in-law of this house? All my wishes in life will be fulfilled. But that girl must be having a name too. She does. Shivani. I'll call the priest tomorrow and look for an auspicious date. Thank you, mummy. It is.. Jackpot. Greetings. Mr. Vijay, you? Mother? Greetings, Mother. What was the need for this gift? Well, when you've brought it, I'll keep it. What's going on, Mohanlal? Well Shivani's getting married. Yes. If you ask me, Mother, I don't like this alliance. The boy is a pilot. He flies planes. Now if something happens to the plane up there.. ..he'll go up there and here.. Oh, Mother! Mr. Vijay! 'There's a star far away in the sky.' 'I like it.' 'Give me what I like.' 'Mother, give me that star.' 'Mother, give me that star.' 'Mother, give me that star.' Forget Shivani. Time is the greatest salve. It heals all wounds. Slowly, everything will be okay. I've an idea. Go to London for some days. You'll get a break from this. I'll check in. I'll call you every day. I want to see my son laugh as before. Oh, Mr. Vijay, you? Greetings, Mother. Where are you going? - London. Where are you going? Me? Why are you joking? Where can I go? It's a big deal that I've reached the airport. Shivani is going with her husband. To New York. He has been posted there for 4 years. There. They are going. I'll go. Take care of yourself. I'll leave. Bye. What's this file regarding? We've a contract with Star Exports, London for 5 years. It will be finished this year. - These are the renewal papers? - Yes. Good. Thank you, Mr. Saxena. Madam, we need Mr. Vijay's signatures on these papers too. He's not here. Where has he gone? Hunting. What do I tell you, Mr. Saxena? Vijay has changed so much in these 4 years. I don't know why he's so angry with life. Madam, why don't you get him married? Everything will be all right. That's what I want too. Maybe he'll love life after marriage. Hari Singh. - Yes, sir? There's a deer in the car outside. You people cook and eat it up. Yes, very good. Vijay, why do you kill innocent animals? I like it. It's great fun. Anyway stay at home tonight. Mr. Sharma and his daughter are coming over for dinner. Tonight I've to attend police commissioner's party. It's very important for me to go. It's also very important to meet Mr. Sharma. Because he's going to America tomorrow. And I've talked to them about your marriage. That's why you must meet his daughter. I have told you many times that I don't want to get married. So why do you keep talking to people about that? I don't want to hear anything. Go to the party if you want to. But come back home quickly. Hello, Mr. Vijay. Welcome. - How are you, sir? Fine. If you hadn't come, I would've been angry. I've arranged this party only for you. - Thank you. Otherwise, you know, I'm marrying my daughter off in Delhi. Mr. Commissioner. How are you sir? Hello, Ashok. Welcome. - Yes. Meet him. He's Mr. Vijay Agnihotri. Mr. Ashok Chopra. Hello, Mr. Vijay. How are you? I'm very happy to see you. Ashok, where's Shivani? Shivani must be with Geeta. - She's not there. She must be somewhere around. - Okay. "She was an 18-year-old virgin." "She had hidden her face behind a veil." "She was an 18-year-old virgin." "She had hidden her face behind a veil." "She was trapped in a field of gram." "There was a theft in the field of gram." "He held her wrist first.." "..and then he pressed her finger." "He held her wrist first.." "..and then he pressed her finger." "There was a fight in the field of gram." "There was a theft in the field of gram." "There are many hunters waiting for me." "They are the stealers of youth." "There are many hunters waiting for me." "They are the stealers of youth." "I called out in vain." "I was expecting someone." "I was expecting someone." "She was young and veiled." "She was young and veiled." "She was wearing bangles." "The bangle broke in the field of gram." "There was a fight in the field of gram." "Oh God! Do not look at me." "How do I tell the story to everyone?" "Oh God! Do not look at me." "How do I tell the story to everyone?" "About all that happened with me?" "Nobody came to help me." "Nobody came to help me."

We just have to catch the flight. - Thank you. We won't be able to sleep. But, dear, you just get accustomed to waiting. Vijay comes back very soon. I don't know, today.. - Mother. Here he is. Vijay, you're very late. Yes, Mother. I got late. Too late. Okay, come downstairs now. Vijay, he's Mr. Sharma, and his daughter, Seema. Seema. You want to marry me? Vijay. - Yes? Can you sing? Then sing. 'She was an 18-year-old virgin.' Vijay. What's all this? Do you know how to dance? Dance just like this. "There was a fight in the field of gram." "There was a theft in the field of gram." Vijay! You won't understand, Mother. You'll never understand. 'There was a star in the sky.' 'I like it.' 'Give me what I like.' 'Mother, give me the star.' Okay? And look.. Tell all your friends to come to your birthday party. Okay, Mother. Mother, shall I call my teacher? Yes, call her. - Pinky. Pinky. Come on quickly. Rinku's mother has come to take you to school. Come on. Hi, Radha. - Hello, Shivani. Where's Rinku? - In the car. Sister-in-law, I'll get the kids from school in the evening. Okay. Bye, Mother. - Bye. Come on. Bye. - Bye. Where are you going? Shall we have one? Let me go. I'm late. I've to reach the hospital. This is what I don't understand. You quit your air-hostess' job after marriage. So what's the need for this social service.. ..in the hospital for the disabled? You go on the flight. Pinky goes to school. I'm bored at home all alone. But I'm not working there for money. Ashok, the joy of serving those disabled.. ..is the greatest in the world. They're humans, but nature has played a horrible joke on them. Look at them closely. What do they lack? Only their brains cannot control their bodies. They also want to laugh and talk like others. But they are unable to. They just look at people with quite eyes. There's just one medicine for that. Love and sympathy. Vicky, how are you? Just a minute. Look. Chocolate. When I had started working here, he couldn't even move. Look at him now. He's so active. If he's loved like this, he'll start walking in some days. Ashok, God has given me a life. If I can give them a life with that.. ..I'll consider myself very fortunate. Shivani, please come to my office. - Yes, coming. Okay, Shivani, I'll leave now. I'll come in the evening to pick you. No. No need for that. You take Pinky to the cake shop in the evening. And don't forget to get balloons and masks for the children. Okay? You don't worry about me. I'll come. Okay. What? - Where are you going? Shall we have one? Go. For the jackpot in the second race, horse number 9. Mohanlal. Oh sir, you? God himself in a pauper's house. Come please. Have a seat. Mohanlal. I want Shivani's address. Shivani, sir? You still haven't forgotten Shivani? I mean she's married now. She didn't agree for modelling earlier. Why would she agree now? You want a model, don't you? A girl? I'll wear a sari. Women do have buck teeth. Shut up! I want Shivani's address. For this amount of money, not only Shivani's address.. ..I'll get her to you. Ashok. Someone call my Ashok. Ashok. Shivani. Shivani. What happened? - Ashok. Someone stole her 'Mangalsutra' (Wedding necklace). Please take her home. She's very scared. Thank you. - Please go. Come on. What are you doing? I'm taking care of the envelopes. Amazing! What if they're lost? There's no one except you who will take them. Don't you speak such rubbish to me. Where are you? You? Do you remember me? Vijay Agnihotri. Yes, I remember. I remember. Can I ask you something? Are you still like that or have you changed for the better? Believe me. I'm still exactly like that. Sir. My master, how are you? I'm fine. - What made you come here? I want to meet Mr. Ashok Chopra. He's inside. Come in, please come. Let's go. - Come. Whose birthday is it? - Shivani's daughter's. Shivani's daughter's? - Yes. I'm sorry, I didn't know or I'd have brought a gift for the kid. Please don't worry. This watch is very good for a gift. Here, give it to the child. Yes, I'll give it right away. - Oh! What's this? He gave me a gift. - Here. No, please keep it. - Yes, keep it. Such expensive gifts aren't given to children. Take this. You'll never change. - Mr. Vijay. Please come. How are you? - Fine. Thanks, yesterday night you saved Shivani.. I've come to you for something important right now. - Yes? You must be aware that a new airline is being launched. Blue Bird. - Yes I'm the owner of that company. And I wish you to be the general manager of that company. Me? - Yes. And see I don't have much time. So I want you to say yes or no, right now. Mr. Vijay, your offer is very good. But I should know some terms and conditions too. I'll send you a copy of the agreement. Actually, I'm going to Mauritius right now on flight. Doesn't matter, I'll give it to Shivani. I'm sorry, but tomorrow I'm going to Mauritius too. Yes. Okay. I'll fax the copy of the agreement to Mauritius. That's okay. All right? - I'll leave, Mr. Ashok. Mr. Vijay, have some cake. Some other time. Bye. - Sure? Bye. - Bye. Okay. What are you doing? I know him very well. He's crazy. Shivani, his offer is very good. Mummy, dad. Come quickly for the cake cutting. Yes. - Come on. Shall we have one? - Shut up! Come on. Shivani, when are you returning from Mauritius? I'll come by next Tuesday. - Okay. - That... Shivani! Just a minute. He's the one who attacked you, right? Yes. - Mrs. Shivani.. ..this is yours. Thank you. Just a minute, Shivani. Hit him. What? - Yes. He attacked you, right? He should be punished. Right? I've got my 'Mangalsutra'. And the punishment.. The police will punish him. I.. You'll punish him. The thing is.. ..he should know what the result of attacking Shivani is. Isn't it? Stop it! Arjun Singh. - Yes? Did I do anything wrong? No. It's very difficult to understand these women. Come on. That was bad. Really. I didn't know that Vijay was such a bad man. Does anyone hit a thief? If I were him.. ..I would've brought that thief home, fed him.. ..and I would have told him.. ..what was the need to take such a big risk for a 'Mangalsutra'? You should've asked Shivani. - You think this is a joke? Don't be angry, have this ice cream. You'll fast for your husband's life tomorrow. If you stay hungry today and eat something tomorrow, I'll die. Eat it. - Stupid. But remember what I say, Ashok. One day you'll find out that Vijay is crazy. I don't know anything. I want the publicity of the airlines ready by next week. But, sir, the time.. - I don't have time. I want to launch my airlines quickly. It isn't an easy task to launch an airline. You need someone knowledgeable to handle it too. Mr. Saxena, you take care of your work. And as far as handling the airlines is concerned.. ..I have that person. I'm famished. My throat is dry with thirst. When will the moon rise? I'm telling you, fasting abroad is useless. God is in India. He doesn't have a passport that he'll come here.. ..and accept your fasting. You're always kidding. I'm hungry. Okay, tell me. If you break your fast looking at this foreign moon.. ..will God accept your fast? Yes! Idea! They're showing a film related to this on the cable in the hotel. You break your fast watching it. Very funny. - Okay, I'll call Pinky in Mumbai. If you see the moon, call me, okay? Okay. Where did this moon go? It comes out everyday. Where is it stuck today? Come out. It has come out. Ashok! Ashok. See the moon has come out. Wait there. I want to see your face after the moon. Ashok. - Coming. Shivani. Why did Vijay come here? - But what's the matter? The vessel fell from my hands as soon as I saw him. Do you know how inauspicious that is? Ashok, what is he doing here? I'm sorry, Ashok. I disturbed you by coming here. No, what are you saying? Actually, you know that women are so superstitious. The vessel fell from her hands. You tell me. What is it? Ashok, you know.. ..there's very little time left for the launch of my airline. So I thought that if I wait for you to sign the agreement.. ..it will take 5-6 days more. I thought it would be better if I came to Mauritius.. ..and got you to sign the agreement. So nice of you. - Here it is. Please read it properly. Actually, Ashok, I've decided on a salary of Rs.100,000 a month. Do you think it's good enough? Rs.100,000? Read it properly, it must be Rs.1000. It is Rs.100,000. Then surely there must be some clause in the contract.. ..due to which you'll end up with only Rs.1000. Which crazy man are you dealing with? If you ask me, tear the agreement and throw it away. You're amazing, Shivani! Why are you after that man? I don't understand why you get irritated with him. I hate that man's face. - Okay, done. I'll tell him not to show you his face. - Yes. Shall we go? To read the agreement? I don't want to read. You read it. As you wish. Hello, Shivani. Shivani, I'm making Ashok the general manager of my airline. Are you happy? No. - Why? You asked me whether I'm happy or not, I told you I'm not. Now I don't need to answer every question of yours. Shivani, what's your problem with me anyway? Tell me. I'll get rid of it. Your problem is beyond any solution. There's a cure for every disease. There are hospitals for the physically disabled. Mental asylums for the mentally challenged. But there are no asylums for stupid people. You are stupid. How did you find that out? Stupid people don't need an introduction. They prove their stupidity with their actions. And you prove it whenever you speak. Okay, I'm stupid. At least you thought that I am something. But I'll tell you something else about myself too. I'm very adamant also. And there's no asylum for the adamant either. Wow! Your aim is great. Yes and you are an expert archer. You'll hit bull's eye thrice, won't you? Want to bet? You will lose. I never lose, Shivani. "Whenever I see you, my heart beats." "Whenever I see you, my heart beats." "A fire is ignited in my bosom." "It is ignited." "A fire is ignited in my bosom." "Some spark flares up." "Whenever I see you, my heart beats." "Whenever I see you, my heart beats." "My mind's on a high with the softness of your lips." "My memory rises with the softness of your lips." "What kind of yearning is this, beloved?" "My whole body burns." "Whenever I see you, I yearn." "Whenever I see you, I yearn." "The monsoon of your tresses showers sweetness." "The aroma of your love, clouds my senses." "The monsoon of your tresses showers sweetness." "The aroma of your love, clouds my senses." "I swear to you, my steps are faltering." "There is a high." "Whenever I see you, I yearn." "Whenever I see you, I yearn." "Your stylish gait." "Your stylish gait." "You make me crave." "Whenever I see you, my heart beats." "Whenever I see you, I yearn." Nowadays my brains don't work. On which favourite horse.. Come on. 'Why are we at your place?' 'Why are we at your place?' 'The one who is famous, he is actually infamous.' 'Why are we at your place?' What is it? Stop it! Stop what? I haven't even begun anything and you say stop it! Not here! Go out! Get out! Have I come here to reside? I'll stay with you. As your mistress, your love. Come on. - What are you doing? 'These black eyes, these buck teeth.' What rubbish are you talking? Get out! 'When I saw you, cruel one.' 'I was scared.' Give me money. - Out. What money? - Give me the money for Diwali. It's not Diwali. Okay, give me for Holi. - Holi is gone. You'll not get any money. - You had a child, right? Give me. Child? I don't have a child. Why? Are you impotent? - What nonsense! Get out of here. Get back. Come on, we will leave from here. What will this loser give us? He drinks country liquor. Get out! You! Wait! Why did you go into my room? - We went to look for the child. To look for the child? Show me. This. The child. You show me your hand too. This! You'd come to steal. I'll call the police right now. Please don't call the police. No? - No, please. Take it off. I will not take it off. - Not this. Take off this necklace. Take off this necklace. - This is mine. Shut up! Take it out even if it is your father's. We've come to the wrong house. He is a bigger thief than us. Here you are. You've taken everything. What's the matter? Someone was watching us. There is no one here, you must be wrong. Ashok. You are locking such a nice house? This is Mumbai. Anyone can break the lock and get in. Then we'll have to keep going to the courts. It's better that I live here. Brother, come on. Don't we have to wait for Shanti? Sister said that she'll pick Shivani from the clinic.. ..and come to the new apartment. Come on. Oh, Shivani! What are you doing? I'll do it. Come on, Sister. - Wow! What a wonderful apartment. It is better than the old apartment. We'll stay here from tomorrow. - You shut up! Yes, Ashok. We went to the doctor. Really? - There's some good news for you. What? You're going to become a father. - What? One more. Come here. - Let me talk. You keep speaking rubbish. Please keep quiet! Okay, Ashok. We'll leave now. Take care of Shivani. - Where will we go? It's such a huge house, they'll get scared. We'll stay here. Come on. - Listen to me. Ashok. I'll pick up Pinky and go home. Both of you come there, okay? - Okay. Bye. Sweetheart! Our son is so lucky for us. I got such a huge house, such a nice job and so much joy. I love you, baby. How do you know it will be a son? Is it? You're asking me? Come here. I'll ask and tell you right now. Hello, child, I'm your father here. What did you say? Just a minute. Your son is telling me to take care of his mother until he arrives.. ..and give her a lot of love. Oh, Mr. Vijay! You? - I'm extremely sorry. I shouldn't have come here without informing you. No, it's okay. Actually, I thought that I'd come here and ask you.. ..how do you find the new house? Do you wish for anything else? No, it's just perfect. - I am glad. And these publicity designs are ready too. Please go through them. - Oh, my God! That was quick, I must say. I believe that you'll like them a lot. Mr. Vijay, Shivani's picture? Yes! You didn't like it? But why Shivani's photograph? Actually I'd seen Ms. Shivani's photograph in.. ..an advertisement before. So I thought.. - Shut up! How dare you use my photograph? I'm sorry. I will change it if you don't like it. Get lost from here! I said get out of here! Get out! - Shivani, what insolence is this? How dare he use my photograph? It's a design, not a photograph. And he's saying that he'll change it. We'll not stay in this house. - What nonsense are you talking? You'll have to leave the job. Where will we get such a salary from? Yes, you'll have to leave the job. - Don't shout, Shivani. I'll shout. I will. I'll scream. What will I do if I leave this job? Where will I get such a salary? What do you lack? What will you do with so much money? I earn the money for you, Pinky and the child who'll be born soon. You want money? Leave this job. I'll earn the money. Shivani. I'm leaving this house. Shivani. Wait. If you leave, don't come back to this house again. Just don't come back. You hit Shivani? You hit Shivani? What are you doing here? You hit? You hit Shivani? - Mr. Vijay, this is my personal matter. You don't interfere. And please get out of here. You hit Shivani? I said get out! Out! You hit Shivani? - Out! You hit Shivani? - Get out! You hit Shivani? - Get out! You hit Shivani? - Get out, I said! You hit Shivani? - Yes, I hit her! Why? Why did you hit her? Why? Why did you hit her? Why? Tell me. Why did you hit her? Why? Why did you hit her? Why? Why did you hit Shivani? As you said, Mr. Ashok didn't have any enemies. Then there could be just one reason behind the attack. Robbery. Someone came into the house to rob. And he tried to stop him. And that's why he was injured. I shouldn't have left him alone. I shouldn't have. - Mrs. Chopra. Yes, Doctor. Mr. Ashok is unconscious. He'll have to be kept on oxygen till tomorrow. One of you can stay with him. Okay. I'll leave now. Tell me as soon as he regains consciousness. I've to take his statement. Thank you, Inspector. - It's all right. Sister, you go home, Pinky is alone. Come tomorrow morning. Okay. - Yes. Shivani. Please go away from here. Shivani, there's no one in this world... who hasn't made a mistake. But the one who corrects his mistake is smart. I have brought these papers. Just sign them. What kind of papers? Divorce papers. I've spoken to the lawyer. You sign these. And then marry me. What did you say? Are you insane? Have you gone crazy? Yes. I've gone crazy. Your love has made me crazy. Go away from here right now. Get out of here! He doesn't value you, Shivani. He has hit you. Forget him. And marry me. What do you think? I'll divorce Ashok and marry a wretch like you? He has given you two pence worth of vermilion.. ..so will you always be his? Vijay Agnihotri! Marriage must be a joke for you. But marriage is priceless for a woman. Try to understand, Shivani, forget Ashok. Marry me. A woman marries only once. With vows around the sacred fire.. ..a husband and wife form an unbreakable bond. Nobody can break that bond. Nobody can break it. Even God won't forgive you for the cheap words.. ..that you've said to me today. Aren't you ashamed to speak to a married woman like this? I'm married, Vijay Agnihotri! I'm married. And now? No! Ashok. Ashok. No! Doctor. What happened? Doctor. Please help. Doctor. Save my Ashok. Please help me. Save my Ashok. 'Give me what I like.' 'Mother, give me that star.' Sir, the inspector wishes to meet you. Tell me, Inspector. - Mr. Vijay. You know Mr. Ashok Chopra. Yes. - He is no more. And his wife says that you've killed him. What are you talking about, Inspector? I would kill him? Vijay. What's going on? Mother, Ashok Chopra is dead. What? - Yes. And he has come to tell me that Shivani has accused me of his death. But why? - That is what I am telling him. Why would I be Ashok's enemy? In fact, we'll suffer the greatest loss with Ashok's death. My new airline is about to be launched. And I was totally depending on poor Ashok. But Ms. Shivani tells us that.. ..you were in Nanavati hospital at 11 o' clock at night. What time did you say it was? - 11 o' clock. 11 o' clock? - Yes. But from 9 to around 12.30.. ..I was having dinner with an officer from your department. Which officer? - Inspector Arjun Singh. He's lying. I'm telling you the truth. Vijay Agnihotri has killed my husband. But, Mrs. Chopra. According to the post mortem report your husband has had.. ..a natural death. He has had a natural death because of suffocation. That's what I'm telling you. He couldn't breathe because Vijay had taken off.. ..the oxygen pipe from his mouth. Shut up! Once she says that there has been a murder. Then she says that the oxygen pipe was taken off. Sir, I have told you earlier too. Vijay Agnihotri was having dinner.. ..with me at my place when her husband died. Now you tell me, sir. A person is having dinner at my place.. ..and at the same time, he murders someone at the hospital? Is it possible? I'm telling you the truth. Vijay Agnihotri has killed my husband. Why don't you believe me? I swear on my child. He has killed my husband. I beg you. Give me justice. Give me justice. She's just acting, sir. Give me justice. I believe, Arjun Singh, that.. ..Vijay Agnihotri was having dinner with you at that time. But why is Shivani naming him repeatedly? She won't benefit by taking your name or mine. What do you mean? Sir, I know this woman very well. She had an affair with Vijay even after marriage. She asked Vijay for money all the time. And Vijay gave her money. Vijay stopped giving her money a few days ago. She thought that this is a good chance. Vijay will give her millions to save his dignity. Did you understand the story now? - Oh, I see. Sir, forget these women. Come on, we'll have something. Vijay, you were saved this time because of me. But whatever you did was not right. If I wasn't here.. Can I tell you something? - Yes? Forget Shivani. Today you have said it. But don't say this ever again. I have loved only one girl in my life. And her name is Shivani. Shivani will never be yours, Vijay. Do you know, Arjun Singh? When I was in school as a kid, there was a girl in my class. She had a very beautiful glass doll. Just like this. I liked it a lot. And I asked her for it repeatedly. But she didn't give it to me. Do you know what I did? Pinky, I'll get new toys for you everyday. But you will call me father and not uncle, okay? But you're not my father. No, child. I'm your father now. Pinky, come here. Murderer! Killer! How dare you enter my house? Get lost from here! Don't be angry. I've brought something for you. I.. See, you wanted vermilion, right? Here. Marry me. Wretch! You had said that it was priceless for a married woman. Marry again, Shivani. This white sari doesn't look good on your body. Do you know the meaning of this white sari? This sari shows the sanctity of a marriage. This is not a white sari. It is the jewel of a widow. But you cannot spend all your life with this jewel. Because one needs support to survive in this life. I have the memories of my husband with me. And I have my children. All this is enough to spend one lifetime. But I cannot see you as a widow, Shivani. I love you a lot. This is not love, this is your lust. What did you say? Lust? - Yes, lust. No! Don't say that. Please don't say that. Shivani, my love is true. Don't insult my love. Just say once that you love me too. I hate you. Shivani, just say once that you love me too. I said get lost from here. Just say that you love me too. I curse you. You'll writhe and die. Just say that you love me too. Say you love me. Say it. Say you love me. Say it. Say you love me. Say it. Say you love me. Say it. Say you love me once. Say it. Say it. Say it, Shivani. Shivani. I beg of you, Shivani. Just once. Say that you love me only once. Just once. Please. Juhu Police Station? I am speaking from block number 18, 7th road. Someone is about to be killed here. Please come soon. No! No! No! No! What happened? Shivani Chopra tried to kill me. I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything. Please tell me in which court is Shivani Chopra's case? Just a minute. Shivani Chopra. Court number 2. - Number 2. Constable, put me in a proper place. I'm telling you. May you be ruined! He's a thief! A very big thief! I got 2 years, you're going to get 5. You steal from guests in the house. I curse you! May you be ruined! Shut up! Handcuff him. What are you staring at? Yes, handcuff us. Are we going to come out? We don't have anything to hide. 'Try hiding it. But the secret can't be hidden.' 'The face reveals what's in the heart.' Shut up! Where are his papers? What is his name? Did you forget? Champa Chameli. Send a drum in this time or else we get bored. You didn't even send a pair of scissors last time. Our life is nothing without drums. - Shut up. Sir, this is a very romantic case. Should I put him in a male prison or a female prison? The name is Champa Chameli so the women jail is fine. What am I going to do there? They won't even let me clap. I'll get bored all alone. Okay, take her to the male prison. - What male prison? What are you saying? I'll be alone with so many men. What if I'm raped? I'm a virgin, untouched. Got it? Where do you want to go? Sir, can I take her home? - Please let him take me home, sir. Yes, he won't get bored and I'll be under the law as well. - Shut up. This is a mistake, if anything happens inside you'll be responsible. I won't spare you. - Champa, my friend. I cannot live without you. My sister. Take us with you. My love is always with all of you. It's just a matter of 2 years. Shut up. And listen. Whether it is betrothal, marriage, Holi Diwali, or birth.. ..keep a proper account of them all. I'll come and take my share. Understood? Come on. Bye. - Bye. Constable. - Yes? Hold me. When I reached the bungalow, Vijay Agnihotri was badly wounded. And Shivani Chopra had a dagger in her hand. You can go now. My Lord. I want to tell the court. All crimes are linked to the story of the criminal's past life. I ask the court permission to present Vijay Agnihotri. Permission granted. I'll speak the truth. And nothing but the truth. Mr. Vijay Agnihotri, do you know the woman standing there? Yes, she's Mrs. Shivani Chopra; Mr. Ashok Chopra's wife. Since when do you know her? Since the last 5-6 years. Mr. Agnihotri, what was so special about Ashok that.. ..you made him the general manager of your airlines.. ..though he was just a pilot? I did it because Shivani asked me to. What was your relationship with Shivani.. ..that you gave Ashok such a big job on her request? Shivani and I had a physical relationship. Vijay Agnihotri! Don't lie so much that lie itself is ashamed. So, Mr. Vijay Agnihotri. Will you tell the court.. ..why then, did Shivani try to kill you? Sir, sometimes a person makes a mistake due to his youth. And he has to pay for it later. Even I'd committed such a mistake. I had physical relations with an immoral woman. That day when I reached Shivani's place at her request.. ..she had vermillion in her hands. She told me to marry her right away. How could I marry her? The one who had a physical relationship with me.. ..despite being married.. ..could have a physical relationship with.. ..anyone after marriage. Such women cannot be with just one man, sir. I refused marriage. And she picked the dagger.. ..and attacked me. You wretch! You're lying! I won't spare you - Order! Order! I'll kill you! Considering the witnesses' statements and the evidence.. ..this court concludes that the accused.. ..Shivani Chopra attacked Vijay Agnihotri with intent to kill. This court sentences Shivani Chopra.. ..to 3 years rigorous imprisonment under section 307. No, sir! Please! Please don't do that. I didn't commit any crime. I'm innocent. I beg you! You're not punishing me, but my innocent daughter. That unfortunate one doesn't have a father. Now please don't take her mother from her too. A mother is begging you for mercy for her daughter. Don't punish my daughter. Please don't punish my daughter. Aunty, where's mummy? She'll come. Shivani has been sentenced to 3 years. What? - 3 years! Mummy. Mummy, take me in your arms. Please take me in your arms, mummy. Why don't you speak to me, mummy? Mummy, what is this? Aunty, what has mummy worn? Mummy, hold me. Mummy, speak to me. Mummy. Mummy, don't leave me. Mummy, don't leave me. Mummy, don't leave me. Mummy, don't leave me. Mummy, don't leave me. I will come with you too. Mummy, wait! Mummy, I will come with you. Mummy.. Mummy, don't leave me and go. Mummy, please come back. Please come back. Stand right here. You look very innocent. But I know you're not. You've been foolin' around with your lover? You damn prostitute! You look me in the eye? I'll rip your eyes out and put them in your hands. Do not scream! Listen to one thing. In this prison no one can even breath without my permission. If you try anything wrong, do you see this stick? It's very strong. Take off your clothes. I told you to take off your clothes. No. Won't you take them off? Won't take them off? Wretch! You did not feel any shame taking them off for your lover! Don't cry. There's nobody here to have pity on these tears. What have you been arrested for? For something I didn't do. That's women's destiny. Look at me. My mother-in-law and husband tried to burn and kill me for dowry. I tried to save myself. And while doing that.. And while doing that my mother-in-law burned and died. I was sentenced to life imprisonment. God has given us women the power to tolerate such injustice. Not God, but a man has written this fate for me. He killed my husband in my presence. He.. He accused me and proved me immoral in court. I kept shouting but nobody heard me. The jingle of money rendered law deaf too. Why? What was my fault? What was the fault of my child? Why was she separated from her mother? What was her fault? Where's your daughter? With my sister. Here child. Have milk. Yes! Give her milk. It's her father's money, isn't it? Yes, child. Have it. Eat a lot also. Eat this house. Your father has left all this. What are you saying? I'm right. Somehow I manage to collect money for alcohol. And you treat her to milk? Who'll pay for all this? Her mother? What are you doing? Give me the chain back. - I won't. I was worried about her expenses till today. Now selling this chain will give me peace. You should be ashamed of yourself. - Shut up! I'll slap you. And you shut up! I'll hit you so hard that you'll join your father. She just keeps crying all the time. Tell her to be silent. Tell her. Take her away. Shit! All my high has gone. You spared time for this charity show. We're grateful to you. We can collect a lot of money for the earthquake victims. Yes. We've invited India's famous dancer Ms. Rupali for this program. Please come. Ms. Rupali charges Rs. 100,000 per show. But she's doing this charity show for free. Very good. When will the show begin? It will begin right away. - Please. "I've brought earrings, anklets, attitude and pepper." "I've brought earrings, anklets, attitude and pepper." "I've come from Kolhapur!" "I've come from Kolhapur!" "Earrings, anklets, attitude." "I've brought earrings, anklets, attitude and pepper." "I've brought earrings, anklets, attitude and pepper." "I've come from Kolhapur!" "I've come from Kolhapur!" "Like a sweet-looking dagger, a spicy areca nut, that's my attitude." "Like a sweet-looking dagger, a spicy areca nut, that's my attitude." "All the Romeos have an eye for me." "I'm scared." "Someone might go crazy." "I stay silent." "Some story might begin." "Nobody believes, nobody knows." "What I've hidden in my drape." "I've come from Kolhapur!" "I've come from Kolhapur!" "I've a small waist, I've doe eyes." "I'm young and beautiful." "I've a small waist, I've doe eyes." "I am young and beautiful." "My fair body has the aroma of flowers." "When I speak." "People get floored." "When I dance." "It's like a dagger piercing the heart." "The lovers have gone crazy." "Whenever I've let my drape slip." "I've come from Kolhapur!" "I've come from Kolhapur!" "Earrings, anklets and attitude." "I've brought earrings, anklets, attitude and pepper." "I've come from Kolhapur!" "I've come from Kolhapur!" Mother, you want me to marry? What? With whom? I want to marry this girl. Mummy. - Pinky. How's my Pinky? Uncle took my chain at night. Sister, is brother-in-law no longer human? He has become worse than a beast. Didn't his hands tremble while pulling the.. ..chain off this poor girl? Never mind. I'll give you a new chain. Really? Tell me. Do you trouble aunty? No. Do you have your food every night? - Yes. And do you have milk everyday? - No. Why? - Because you don't come home. I'll come, child. I'll come very soon. Mother, you come home today. You're not at home and neither is father. I don't like it there. Mother, where has father gone? Child, father was flying a plane in the sky. He ran out of fuel. So he landed his plane in another world. It's a strange world. There are a lot of good toys there. There's a singing doll. There's a bear who dances. There's a monkey who plays with the kids. Father said.. He'll return soon with lots of toys for Pinky. If father doesn't come then I'll go to him. Come on, the visiting hours are over. Come on. Come on, child. Go home with aunty. - No Come. - Go. Mummy. Mummy. Don't be adamant. - Go! I want to be with you. - Leave me. No, I want to go to mummy. Mummy. Mummy. Mummy. Mummy. Bless you. Come, Rupali, I'll introduce you to the guests. Mother, I want to change Rupali's name. - What? From today, her name will be Shivani. Come on. Quickly. Come on, quickly. Where are they taking us? It seems some political leader is here again. A politician? In this prison? This prison often turns into a brothel at night. For the leaders who are the keepers of the law. Come on! Come on quickly. I'm telling you, sir, there's a new girl, Shivani Chopra. You take her. She'll be perfect for you. Jailer, you are a woman, you cannot understand men. Once, even with you, I.. I'll choose nicely today. Sir? - Yes? Shivani Chopra. She's good. What happened, Shivani? I am pregnant. What? My husband's last memory is growing within me. Wait a minute, sir. Shivani, I'll kill you. - Please don't hit her. Hurry up and take a girl so that I can wash my face. This girl will do? I do not care, bring her. No, jailor, no! - Come on. No, jailor, no! Do you hold on to me, wretch? Who do you think you are? Stop screaming! Shut up! Come on. No, jailor. - Why are you shouting? Who will hear your screams here? I'll kill you. Shut up! No. No. Shut your mouth, bastard! I will not leave you, shut up! What are you doing? - I'll skin you. Leave Pinky! - Why should I? Should I love her? I'll kill her. Her mother is gone. She has left her with me. We've lost our reputation. I can't face people in the city. People say that I've kept a killer's daughter in my house. She won't stay here. Throw her out of the house. I say throw her out. Shut up! She won't go anywhere. She'll stay right here. You're shouting at me in my house. After all, you're that killer's sister, aren't you? You get lost from here too. - No! Both of you, out of my house. - Where will I go? Go and sit on the footpath. You'll get good alms with this child in your lap. And if the alms are not enough, sell yourself. Don't come back to this house or I'll break your limbs. Get lost. Evil. I'll see. Let me go. What is this, Jailor? You've shifted me four times in two months. From the male prison to the female prison and vice versa. Do you know it's such a problem for me? You'd just put me in the male prison, right? Then why did you put me back in the female prison? What's all this? Shut up! Take off your clothes. What? What did you say? - Wear these clothes. I'll go and change later. Listen. How much are you paid here? - What? What's your salary? Remuneration? - Why? Why? Must be getting around Rs.5000. I earn that much everyday. I have an idea. When I get released from here, you come with me. I'll keep you in my group. You look like one of us, come on. Shut up and get out. Think about it. If you join my group, you will enjoy. 'There is one beautiful girl.' 'To many who want it, to whom shall I give this heart?' 'Your trousers are sexy, your belt is sexy.' 'Your shirt sexy, your cap is sexy.' 'You...are sexy.' 'Your stick is sexy.' 'Sexy.' Stupid! Nisha, how are you? How can a woman who's been a victim of lust be? Come on. I've begun to hate those guardians of the society.. ..who swear by righteousness in the day.. ..and rape innocent women at night. But this won't continue in this prison now. Nobody can stop what is happening. I'll stop it. I've written a letter to the home ministry against the jailor. Shivani, what did you do? What if the jailor finds out? Nobody will find out anything, why are you scared? Shivani, someone has come to see you. Go, Shivani. Shivani. You? Come on, at least you recognize me. How can I forget you? This prison life. This widowhood. These are your gifts. You can marry once again. You can be free of this prison life. Just once. Just say once that you love me. Forget this lifetime. I'll never say it in any lifetime. The same anger, the same pride. Shivani, I thought that the prison life must've softened you up. But, no. You haven't changed. Do you know why I've come here? Wretches like you have a fetish. Of heaping insults over injuries. It's obvious that this fetish has brought you here? Not a fetish. But love. Your love has brought me here, Shivani. Do you remember, I'd told you.. ..that I destroy whatever I cannot get? I've destroyed you. And now I'm marrying. This is the card. And I've given the woman I'm marrying, your name. Shivani. You can pacify yourself by giving some other girl my name. But in reality, this name will become a wound in your life. It'll make you realize repeatedly that you couldn't.. ..win against Shivani. You've lost. You have lost, Vijay Agnihotri. Are you Shivani Chopra? Yes. But why have I been called here? Your sister and daughter have met with an accident. Accident! How did it happen? The owner of Agnihotri industries. Mr. Vijay Agnihotri's car crashed into them. Vijay Agnihotri. No, inspector. This can't be an accident. He has deliberately.. This is an accident. Because Vijay Agnihotri is injured in it too. You don't know him. I know him very well, he is a wretch. Look, Inspector, I've told you that my wife had a 'Mangalsutra'. Where's it? I'm a very bad man. If I don't get the 'Mangalsutra', I'll complain.. ..against you to the CBI. Do you know what was the cost of that 'Mangalsutra'? It cost Rs.15,000. Move. - You didn't get it. Where are you taking this dead body? She had earrings too. Let's see if they're still there. Yes, they're there. Where's my daughter? Please come with me. Come, please recognize your daughter. No! She's not my daughter. She's not my daughter. Inspector, my daughter is very mischievous. She won't just lie like this. She cannot be silent like this either. She's very mischievous. She's someone else's child. And you say that she's my daughter. She's someone else's child. I'm her mother. Won't I recognize her? It's a mistake. She had promised me. No! No! No! No! No! Shivani. What are you doing? - Let me go. Are you crazy? - Let me die. There's nothing left in my life. There was just one child. Shivani. What are you doing? Come to your senses. Come to your senses, Shivani. Let me die, Nisha. Let me die, Nisha. No, Shivani. You'll have to live. If not for yourself, then for your child. He's the last memory of your husband. Shivani, night doesn't exist forever. After every night comes a morning. Yes. You're right. A ray of hope exists in my dark life. My child. The child who's listening to every scream of his mother. Nisha, I beg to God that I should have a son. And he should burn those people alive.. ..who've set his mother's life afire. What did you say? Champa is not here. I met sister in this jail three days ago. Did you shifted her to the men's jail again? I was shifted here again. - Sister. I am glad you came here. I have gone crazy. How many times will I be shifted from this jail to the other jail? Not even an honest cop has been transferred so many times. I won't forgive you. I'll make a rebellion. I'll become a minister. I'll run for the elections. I will make an army. I'll go to Delhi. I will become a leader. Sister, have you become a leader in jail? In jail I found out... that people become leaders when they leave. Sister, do eunuchs become political leaders? There are many, but they do not tell us. I'll become the most important leader. When I'll have the power, in the first place I'll dismiss her from her position! Shut up! Constables. Arrest her. I have some urgent work. Lock her in the dungeon. 'These black eyes, these rotten cheeks.' I won't spare you. May you be ruined! May you rot in hell! The home ministry has complained against you. That you torture innocent women in prison. And force them into the flesh trade. Who has complained? There's one snake in your prison. I'm not proceeding against you.. ..because I want you to teach that woman a lesson.. ..she'll never forget in her life. Trample that snake. Just tell me her name. Shivani Chopra. You wretched woman. You dare to complain against me. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I won't spare you. I'll kill you. Do not hit me. I am pregnant. Oh yes? Are you pregnant? Yes. Whose child is it? My husband's. Your husband's or your lover's? My husband's. Sheila. - Yes ma'am. Hold her hands. - No! No. No. Are you going to have a child? Did you complain against me, right? Did you complain against me? Did you complain against me? Did you complain against me? I'll kill you. I won't spare you, wretch. I won't spare you. Have all of you seen? If anyone dares to raise their voice against me.. ..then this will be the consequence. Take her away and lock her in the dungeon. Come on. Shivani's complaint helped me somehow. I got a man like you. Today I found out why rich and powerful people want you. Well, tell me, what did you do to Shivani? I taught her such a lesson that... she won't complain again... she won't be able to think about me. I left her squeezed like a lemon. Shivani what has happened? - Don't cry, Nisha. Look into my eyes. Not a single tear. Like dried blood, tears have dried up in my eyes. Wipe these tears off. They make women weak. Do you know, Nisha? Why women are being tortured? Because they tolerate injustice. But the world doesn't know that.. ..the tolerance limits of a woman are like earth. It tolerates every injustice. But when her rage erupts like a volcano.. ..she destroys everyone. The world has seen the woman as a mother, a daughter and a sister. But not as the Goddess of Death. The prisoners are holding a night-long prayer meeting in prison. Wow! They commit sins first and then look for redemption. Shall I stop it? - No. I can't do that. It's about religion. But all of you keep an eye on them. Nobody should escape from there with this excuse. And that Shivani. Send her to me. Some of my special guests are arriving. Say hail to the true court! - Hail! Once again, say hail to the true court! - Hail! Louder! Hail to the true court! - Hail! Shivani, madam has called you to the office. O Goddess on the tiger! - Hail! O Goddess with the light! - Hail! O Goddess with power! - Hail! Say hail to the true court! - Hail! Once again, say hail to the true court! - Hail! May I come in? Come in, Shivani. Do you know why I've called you here? Yes, I know that. Many a times, people like you call their own death. Did you forget the lesson I taught you? No. I remember it well. I remember that I begged. But you killed the last memory of my husband. You turned my womb into my child's grave. I remember everything. But I'll teach you a lesson today that you'll never remember. Because to remember, a person needs to live. And you won't live. I will.. - Don't shout. You said that.. ..nobody can breathe without your permission in this prison? Your breaths will beg for my permission today. Do you sell women, you wretch? This uniform of the law doesn't suit you. Take it off! Take it off! "The flame of revenge burns." "When she goes to take revenge." "The flame of revenge burns." "When she goes to take revenge." "When the avenger is a woman." "She becomes the goddess of Death!" "The flame of revenge burns." "When she goes to take revenge." "When the avenger is a woman." "She becomes the goddess of Death!" "The flame of revenge burns." "When she goes to take revenge." "Justice should reign, sin shouldn't survive!" "She won't spare the sinners." "Won't hurt the innocent." "She's neither scared of law nor consequences." "When the avenger is a woman." "She becomes the goddess of Death!" "The fire of revenge is burning." "When she goes to take revenge." I know you've killed the jailor. You have done it. Enough, Inspector. She hasn't killed the jailor. She was with us at the prayer meeting that night. Arjun Singh. The commissioner has called you to the prison office. Inspector, you were right. I've killed the jailor. But you cannot hurt me. Just like I couldn't prove that Vijay Agnihotri killed my husband.. ..you cannot prove that I've killed the jailor. Go, Arjun Singh. The commissioner is calling you. Come on, Thunderbird. Come on. Come on, Thunderbird. Come on. Go! Thunderbird. Come on. My jackpot. I've won the jackpot. Shivani. You're being released today. But where will you go from here? Nisha.. ..the city you see outside these prison walls isn't a city. It's a battlefield. And I must fight a righteous war on this battlefield. Shivani, what will you do? I'll meet my brother-in-law. I'm rich. Those three were unfortunate. As soon as they went, I became a millionaire. What have you come here for? Go, get lost from here. Neither your sister nor your daughter live here. They're dead. That's why I've come. When no relative of mine is alive, why should you stay alive? You'll have to die too. Who will kill me? You? Yes. I'll kill you. Have you gone crazy? Yes. I've gone crazy. The one who has been rendered a widow.. ..the one whose womb has become barren.. ..the one who has lost everything.. ..is sure to go crazy. You wretch, why are you closing the door? "Whether there are strong winds or a storm." "Even if her life is in trouble." "She accomplishes the task that she has set out to do." "The one who hasn't been defeated by God. How can she get defeated by humans?" "She becomes the goddess of Death!" "When the avenger is a woman." "The flame of revenge burns." "When she goes to take revenge." It hurts a lot, doesn't it? That same pain you gave to my sister... my daughter...and me. Please forgive me. Forgive me, forgive your brother-in-law. l'm doing what l have to do... by sending you to my sister. You chased wealth all your life like a hungry dog, didn't you? Here, eat it. No. - Eat it. No. - Eat it. Eat it, eat it! Eat it! Eat it. "The flame of revenge burns." "When she goes to take revenge." From the state in which Mohanlal's dead body was found.. ..it's clear that the killer just wanted to kill Mohanlal. The killer didn't take any money despite so much of it being around. Another important thing. The killer didn't use any weapon in committing the murder. Deshpande, find out if Mohanlal's sister-in-law.. ..Shivani Chopra has been released from prison or not. Nobody from that girl's or woman's house came forward. So the police cremated them. The child was small, so she was buried. Where? - There. That's the child's grave. 'Mother, if father doesn't come I'll go to father.' I knew your love would bring you to your child. Move your leg, Arjun Singh. My daughter sleeps here. Don't worry. I'll have you sleep here too. Near her. I'll hit you so badly today.. ..that you'll never forget Arjun Singh's name. As it is, it isn't easy to forget the name of beasts. "When she takes the sword in her hands." "She either kills or gets killed." "In the cold, dark night." "She becomes thunder in rains." "She guards womanhood." "She doesn't fear anyone." "When the woman takes revenge." "She becomes the Goddess of death." "The flame of revenge burns." "When she goes to take revenge." Whom do you want to meet? Vijay Agnihotri. There's no Vijay Agnihotri here. Mr. Akash Chand lives here. But he used to live here. I don't know. We reside here since 2 years. Doctor, I've no one in this life now. I've decided.. ..that I'll spend my whole life serving helpless.. ..and disabled people. This is the decision of my life. You can join from today if you wish. But, Doctor, I don't want to live in this city. Because there are memories in this city.. ..which I can't forget even if I wish to. I can understand. I've an idea. A new sanatorium has opened in Tikamgarh. Why don't you go there? Thank you. - Speak to Dr. Kapoor there. I'll tell him about you. Yes, please? I want to see Dr. Kapoor. That's me, tell me. I'm Shivani. Yes, Dr Bhandari told me about you. Come. I've arranged your stay in the quarters behind. Doctor, when was this sanatorium set up? Around 2 years ago. There's a very big industrialist, Mrs. Padma Agnihotri. This sanatorium works because of her donation. Mrs. Padma Agnihotri? Is she the one who used to live in Mumbai a few years ago? - Yes. And her son Vijay? Yes, they've shifted here now. Their bungalow is nearby. Madam is out most of the time. Vijay lives here. Just wait here. "The flame of revenge burns." "When she goes to take revenge." Vijay is in this state because of a car accident. We haven't left anything lacking in his treatment. Not only Indian, we've spoken to renowned doctors around the world. But it's been useless. He's a hopeless case. There's just one way out. If someone treats him with love and creates confidence in him.. ..it's possible that he'd start wishing to live. And he gets cured. Doctor. Give me the responsibility of Vijay Agnihotri's care. Driver, stop the car. Dr. Kapoor. - Madam, you? When did you return from London? How is my son? Can I give you good news, madam? I think your son will be cured very soon. Really? Yes, madam. There's a new social worker. And with the love and care that she's giving Vijay, I'm sure that.. ..Vijay will be cured very soon. I wish to meet that woman. "After many years I've remembered something." "After many years I've remembered something." "I cannot spend my days or nights without you." "I cannot spend my days or nights without you." "My youth came to know about love." "My youth burns, you set it on fire." "My youth came to know about love." "My youth burns, you set it on fire." "I swear beloved, I'll make you yearn." "I'll calm the fire. I'll take you in my arms." "After many years I've remembered something." "After many years I've remembered something." "I cannot spend my days or nights without you." "I cannot spend my days or nights without you." "Today the weather is so good." "My youth is not in my control now." "Today the weather is so good." "My youth is not in my control now." "I'll settle you in the shadow of my tresses." "Wait. What's the hurry, I'll come to you." "After many years I have remembered something." "After many years I have remembered something." "I cannot spend my days or nights without you." "I cannot spend my days or nights without you." "I cannot spend my days or nights without you." "I cannot spend my days or nights without you." Shivani Chopra? Do you know her, madam? Very nicely. You two-timing, immoral woman. You tried to trap my son in your lust even when you were married. And you killed your husband. I know this cure is a farce. You want to kill my son. Let me go. Wait, Doctor. Come out, Agnihotri. Come out yourself. Tell your mother that I'm not immoral. This is your test. Come out. Come on, Vijay. Come out. Come on. Come on, Vijay Agnihotri. Come out. Come. Come on. Come on, Vijay. Are you all right? Shivani. Shivani. Do you know what my mother thinks? She thinks you've done me a favor by giving me a new life. She's so innocent. She doesn't understand that the favor was not done to me.. ..but to yourself. All the roads of your life are closed. There is just one way left, which comes to me. You're all alone, Shivani. And no woman can live all alone. Just say once that you love me. I'm ready to marry you even today. Shivani, you've given me this life. It's my duty to give you a new life. Just once.. Just say once, that you love me. Shivani! Yes, Vijay Agnihotri. I gave you a new life.. ..so that I can snatch it once again. If a woman is an ocean of love and pity.. ..then she can be a fire of hatred too. A small spark can turn anyone into ashes. If as a mother a woman can give life, then in her ferocious form she can take life too. "She becomes Goddess Durga and Goddess Kali." "She kills anyone who challenges her." "She's a storm in the night." "She is the boon of power." Remember how brutally you killed my husband. How you separated my child from me. How you ruined my life. I've been nursing this wound for so long. Your death today is the cure for my wound. Shivani, if you wanted to kill me why did you give me a new life? I was disabled, I was helpless. You could've killed me easily. Yes I could have. But what would I tell God? That I killed a helpless, disabled person? Killing a disabled person is a big sin. And killing a demon like you is a virtue. Shivani, say that you love me. Let me go! "She becomes Goddess Durga and Goddess Kali." I won't let you go, Shivani. If I die, you'll have to die with me. My life is not as necessary as your death. "The one who challenges women will turn into ashes." "The woman knows how to take revenge." "She becomes the Goddess of Death." "The fire of revenge burns."
