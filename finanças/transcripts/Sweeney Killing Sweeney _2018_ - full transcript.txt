- And now, your headliner for this evening is a local comedy legend. How about a nice round of applause for the Character King of Boston comedy, Sweeney? - Thank you, thank you. Wow. Wow. It's great to be here. I know what you're thinking. If anybody knows anything about comedy it's the Chinese. Listen, I'm from Charleston, all my friends are dead. - You're hilarious. I mean, it's so funny I can't even remember all the jokes. - Thanks, what's your name again? - Justin. - Justin. You sounded older on the phone. - That was my Dad. I figured it'd be easier if he called instead of me. - Oh, what is this, school newspaper? - No, it's a homework assignment. - History? - No, it's English class. I have to write a paper about a local celebrity. - Local celebrity, I see. Hey, did ya ever see this guy sweeping the streets? My name's Jimmy Yannel. I'm the shovel man on Wednesdays and Sundays. I'm the broom man Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays. You need a broom man and a shovel man in order to sweep the streets. Wait a minute. There's a lot of local celebrities. Why did you pick me? Because? - Well... - You wanna be-- - Well, I'm thinking about doing some standup comedy. - Standup comedy. - Myself. - Right. - Wanna read some of my jokes? - Oh, yeah. I'd love to read your jokes. Not now, not while I'm eating, but Jesus, that'd be great. So, I used to live in the People's Republic of Cambridge. Neighbors who talked like this. "You know, okay, so I am totally against global warming. "I voted against global warming. "Everything is melting. "The glaciers are melting, the ice caps are melting, "the polar bears are actually melting. "Hello?" - So, how'd you start doing comedy? - Read that, will ya? I don't have my glasses. - You can't be what you want until you accept who you are. - Makes no sense. Lin? These fortunes, they make no sense. - It's all bullshit. - I love him. Lin saw me the first time I was on stage. - It's all bullshit! - So, did you get an agent when you started comedy? - An agent? No. We didn't get an agent. We played places like this. Chinese restaurants, bars, clubs, funeral parlors. Did you ever bomb in a funeral parlor? That is local comedy. My name is Mary Ellen McCarthy. I'm a Dorchester mother, and I've always said, "As long as my kids are happy. "Whatever they wanna do, as long as they're happy. "My daughter's a hooker. "God love her, she's got a pimp "that dresses her very beautifully. "My son, he's in his last year at Walpole. "Not the high school, the prison." - So, what advice do you have for someone starting out? - You want advice? Okay. Do drugs, go to rehab, get off the drugs, talk about it on TV. - Drugs? - Drugs. It's a joke. It's comedy. It's like the Joker in Batman. You know what I mean? Wait 'til they get a load of me. - Uh, yeah. You must really love doing comedy, then, huh? - Comedy? It's a curse. It's like a love/hate relationship. - Sounds like my parents. They're getting divorced. - Oh. Well, that's too bad. - So, one last question. Are you happy? - Am I happy? What's that got to do with anything? You know every neighborhood has got one of these guys here. Huh? Are you shittin' me? Are you shittin' me? You gotta be shittin' me. You can't shit a shitter. So I go to the doctor's the other day. He told me I gotta cut down on the beers in the waitin' room. Happy? Happy? What's that got to do with anything? Happy? Yeah, I'm happy. Course I'm happy. - Well, wouldn't you rather be in L.A. starring in your own sitcom or maybe your own movie? - No, no. Look, they told me when I started, don't do local material. You'll get stuck. Let me ask you something. You tell me, is the stomach of success or failure? - It's a big stomach. - All right, look, I'm gonna tell you something. I'm gonna have my own cable special in L.A. - Really? That's so cool. - Yeah, don't go blabbin' it. It's gonna be happenin'. Don't blab it. - Can I tell my Science Club? - No. Nobody. Don't tell, no. - You're the funniest fuckin' guy ever, Sweeney. - Thank you. - Funniest fuckin' guy ever! - What a tribute, huh? Coming from her? Do you know what that means to me as an artist? - Do you think you could come to my classroom and talk about comedy? It'd be awesome. I'd get an A, for sure. - There gonna be kids there? - Yeah, it's a classroom. - No, I can't. I don't like kids, I hate kids. - No, thank you. - I can't do it, I hate kids. Look, it's nothing personal. It's just, I got nothing to say to 'em. - Did I mention my parents are getting divorced? - All right, I'll come to your class. - Really? Yeah, I'll come to your class. - That's so awesome! Thanks so much, Sweeney! - Oh yeah, great, great. See ya later. - That's my dad. I gotta go. - Okay, yeah, go. Go, see ya. - Okay, bye. - Bye. - You're like all those other guys. Probably got a little hussy in your car. Yeah. Oh. Hey?

I think they're goin' for squatter's rights. - Have you heard from Gene? - Don't worry about Gene. He'll call. - All right, well you gotta get me outta this commercial. - Why, what's the problem? - It's too high. - It's not too high. - It's too high! What do you mean, it's not too high?

We love the fall because then we turn into all these beautiful colors. But leaves never leave. They go into your gutter, then they clog your gutter. That's when you need The Gutter Guys.

Are you fucking shitting me? Heather? She's only been doing it six months and she sucks. - Yeah, that doesn't matter. She's got the look and everybody loves-- - Well, it matters to me. I got integrity. Remember when we saw Richard Pryor? He set the bar high. We were going for somethin'. - Said the man in the leaf costume. - Fuck it. Fuck Gene, fuck the audition. I'm not doin' it. - All right, Sweeney, Sweeney, Sweeney, hold on. Let's be honest with each other. You're not gonna get many more chances like this. I know it sucks, I really do. You know. But even if you don't get the cable special, you'll always be the Character King. No one can take that away from ya. - Yeah, Character King with no characters. All right, I'll think about it. But you have gotta get me outta this before I kill myself. First time I had sex, it was in the backseat of my boyfriend's father's car. With my boyfriend's father, yeah. Sex, do not enjoy sex. It is for procreation only. Read the label. If you don't look at it as procreation, if you look at it as pleasure, you will go to hell. Yeah. - You were really funny. - Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank thank you. Support local comedy. Otherwise, I have to mug ya. Hey, goodnight. Thank you very much. Who's there? ♪ Well, if only they had checked to see ♪ ♪ He mighta opened up his heart ♪ - Hey, what should I do? - You know the shit I've been through. They didn't even want me auditionin' for TV. One fuckin' swear and it was all over. Thank fuckin' god for cable! But you know what? You can't let it worry ya. Come on, we're almost there. Keep up. - Jesus Christ, was that eight flights? - Yep, come on, almost done. - I know. Are we doin' flight for one of these charity's things? We're climbin' for restless legs or we're climbin' for irritable bowels or erectile disfunction? - Okay, Sweeney. This is gonna make the hike all worthwhile. Yes, indeed. - Wow, I was wondering what we were doin'. - Come on over here and help me out. Make yourself useful. Pull up that shade, but don't pull it all the way up. - Not all the way. - Nope. Ah, a little bit more. That's perfect right there. Atta boy. Listen, if there's one thing I learned in this business, you gotta do what makes you happy. Sure, I had the broads, the booze, the drugs, the movies, the TV show, but you know what really made me happy? - All of it. - Absolutely. - You better believe it. - But at the end of the day, I was doin' what I wanted to do and that's the key. See, Sweeney, comedy is introspection. Everybody knows that. Whether you're lookin' for the perfect punchline or the perfect comeback, what we all basically are lookin' for is approval. Comedy comes from within. If it doesn't manage to finish on the outside, nobody's laughin'. You wanna know what to do? Look in there. And let me look in here. Oh, you're new. Oh, oh. Oh, Gladys is back. You musta got your hip fixed. Oh, look at you. That's my little bundle. Don't you judge me, Sweeney. Don't you fuckin' dare judge me! - I'm not judgin' ya. I just don't feel comfortable while you're doin' this. - Oh, get out. Get out! Oh, oh, oh. Is that a downward dog for daddy? Yeah. Oh! Stretch up, reach the sun. Reach for the, oh yes, yes! That's my Gladys. Oh. Yeah. - Grateful Dead's one of the greatest bands of all time, never had a number one hit. "Friend of the Devil," it's a great song, but is it better than "Shake It Off?" Yeah, I think so. But just because it didn't make it to number one, that shouldn't matter. - I'm not sure I can follow this. - Being true to yourself is what matters, unless what you seek changes the truth. Then maybe it's the real truth that you seek. - Yeah, I can see that. Sort of. - 'Scuse me? - What? - Can I get my sausage already? - "Get my sausage?" Can you hold on one second, please? My friend needs some advice over here. Let me talk to him for one second. Why don't you take out your phone, check your fuckin' Instant Dick account there, Leather Lips? - All right, Nick, I can come back later. - No, no! Sweeney, it's all right! Some people are just rude! That'll be four bucks, sir. - I already paid for it. - Okay, here you go. Uncircumcised, just the way you like 'em. - I agree with you about the Dead, though. - Oh, thank Christ, I can sleep tonight. Don't pander. It's not becoming on you. Next! - I sucked in Little League. My teammates used to shout, "No batter, "no batter, no batter" when I was at bat. My girlfriend dumped me. Yeah, she threw all my stuff out onto the sidewalk and I live at home. My cat sheds tears. Thank you, good night. - Tough set, huh? - Yeah. - You okay? - I don't know, man. That sucked. - It really did. Jesus, wow, they hated you. And I can't blame 'em. You know the guy in the back who yelled out, "You suck?" - Yeah, I think. - Yeah, that was me. I'm kidding. These are jokes! Come on! You got good stuff. You'll be all right. Just stick with it. If you stick with it, you'll be miserable like me. But you gotta stick with it. - All right, come on, Sweeney. We're waitin' for ya. Let's go eat. - That's Lily. She's a human dark cloud. - Oh, come on. - You all right? - Yeah, thanks Sweeney. - So, it's an all-girls college. 200 girls sittin' there lookin' at me. You know what my openin' line was? I don't think I brought enough condoms. Killed. - Anyway, what were you saying? - If I do the characters, Gene's gonna give the show to Heather. - I think you owe it to yourself to drop the characters. You don't need to do them. - Really? - I did a benefit for a church. There were nuns in the crowd. Priest comes up to me before the show, blesses me, then tells me no bad language. You know what my opening line was? How the fuck is everybody? Killed. Then I did the joke about how my penis looks like my grandmother. You know that bit. Killed. I got nuns doubled over with laughter. They don't even know what a penis is. I didn't compromise. - It's not compromising, Frank. It's an adjustment. It's okay to adjust. - Let me remind you, when I first moved here, all I heard was Sweeney, Sweeney, Sweeney, like you were the only comic that mattered. Now, the guys you started with, they moved on. Sitcoms, movies, talk shows. But you're still here, you're still doin' it. You know why? 'Cause you're the Character King. Why would you fuck with that? - Okay, so what do you think I should do, Lily? - By the way, I saw Heather totally fuckin' kill the other night. Now, she's got two things goin' for her. Every woman in the audience wants to be her, and every guy wants to fuck her. And she's funny. I heard she's movin' to L.A. I think she's gonna be famous. What? - I don't know, Jonathan. I'm at a crossroads. I feel like my whole life hangs in the balance. - You do understand Sweeney that I'm not really a therapist? I'm still gonna have to charge you. - This could be my last chance to do something really big. - See, I think you have to remember that life is not about last chances. But having said that, I see what you mean. Sometimes in our work, as in life, the lines between comfort and love are blurred. And sometimes, we need a challenge in order to grow as a person. It might be painful, but change is what you need. - Huh. That makes sense. - I'm so glad it makes sense to you because I don't have a fuckin' clue. - Oh. You know what? That's what I need. I need a challenge. I need to shake things up. Yeah. Thank you, Jonathan. - Sure. Oh, hey Nicole, did I ever tell you that my uncle used to be a prominent judge in New York City? And now, he's a wino living in Central Park, but out of respect, people still say, "May I approach the bench?" I think that's sweet. - Hey, not for nothin', how come we're doin' this when you're right over there? - For me, it's technology, I love it. And it seems like it's more sanitary this way. - Okay, they just wanna reshoot the end where you almost fell off the ladder. - George, I made up my mind. - That's great. Go change behind the tree. - I'm gonna do the audition. I'm gonna drop the characters and then do the audition. - Ah, that's just great. It's fantastic. - I feel good about it. - I got a really good feelin' about this. - Me too, me too. - Now, would you go behind the tree? - Hey Sweeney! - Yeah. - I just wanted to say we really love your stuff. - Great. - I have a Gutter Guys hat just for you. - Thank you. I'm good, but thank you. - Sweeney? Oh, don't worry about him. He'll be fine. He's just got a lot on his mind, that's all. It's gonna be great. Let me just say that. He loves gutters. He talks about gutters all day. Just gutters, gutters, gutters, all day long. Can't get enough. Sometimes I will go home, I'll be tryin' to get some rest, he'll call me up, "Could we talk more about gutters?" And I go, "Come on, enough with the gutters for today." He was in a band called the Downspouts. Can you believe that? It's gonna be great. I'll go get him and we'll take care of this. You guys just stay there and keep doin'... Huge fan of gutters. Huge. - So I travel. Went to San Francisco recently. Got my nipples pierced. Don't worry, they caught the guy. That's my time. Thank you, good night. - Oh, Heather Chase, folks. Let her know. Wow! Heather's gonna be auditionin' for her own comedy special, so she'll be back. Let's wish her luck. - Nice set, Heather. - Thanks. Oh, you mean the show. - I guess it's down to me and you for this cable special. You must be nervous? - I don't get nervous, Sweeney. I get ready. And I am gonna nail that audition and get the special. - Huh, pretty sure of yourself. Why's that? - Well, I have something that you don't have. - Something I don't have? Tits. - No. Balls. - So, I'm outta practice pickin' up women. My line used to be, I'd say to a woman, "Listen, when you're done vomiting, can I get your number?" I went to the bar. These two women, they'll talkin' about a three way. I'm thinkin', "Jesus, I can't even get into a rotary. "How do you merge? "Which car goes in first?" You guys have been a great crowd. Thank you. Jimmy? - You've gotta call the police, get these punks off the street. - I saw who did it. - Then you should definitely call the police. - It was Jimmy. - Who's Jimmy? - Jimmy, you know. - Who the hell is that? - Jimmy, from my act. Jimmy. - You're Jimmy from your act. - No, it was Jimmy. - Right. And you're Jimmy. So you mean he looked like you? - No, no, no, no. It was Jimmy. It was Jimmy. He had a broomstick. - Why are we whispering? - It was Jimmy. - What the hell are we talkin' about? - Jimmy! - What happened to your head? - I cut it shavin'. - Oh. That sucks. - Yeah. - I can't wait to shave. - Mm. - So, you're still comin' to my class, right? - Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah. I'm comin' to your class. - Hey. - Hi. - Hi. - Sweeney, this is Carla Fisher. - Ah, wow. - Hi. - This your girlfriend? I underestimated you. - Uh, my mother. - Oh, your mother. Nice to meet you. - Thank you. I've heard a lot about you. - My mom's a documentary film maker. - Okay. The Happy Guy. - I would love it if you could watch it. - It won first place at the North Dakota Film Festival. - And I sent it to Sundance, fingers crossed. - Yes! It's about a guy who lives under a bridge with a lot of pigeons. - Ah, nature movie. - Well, also they actually poop on him so much, he dies from poop poison. - You can die from that? - Well, he had other health issues. But listen, let me get to the point. I think you would make an amazing subject for a documentary. - Really? - Yeah, yeah. I like stories about people that have fallen between the cracks. They're lost in No Man's Land. They get-- - Pooped on. - Pooped on sometimes. Not pooped on, but overlooked. - Wait, wait, wait, wait! Justin, I appreciate what you're tryin' to do, but I didn't fall through any cracks. I don't live under a bridge. What am I, some kind of freak show? - No, of course not. - What am I, the Elephant Man? - Who? - Listen, listen. I'm trying to help you. - How? By makin' me into some kind of loser? - How about a documentary about your life up on the big screen? - I don't know. No. - Come on, you have the story Sweeney that film festivals love. This could open all kinds of doors for you. Movies and television. Local comedy legend finally gets his shot at the big time. Is he gonna get the comedy special that propels him to Hollywood, or is he gonna, will he... - Is he gonna, will he what? - You tell me. - Who's the Elephant Man? - You don't have to raise your hand. - Oh hey, did ya enjoy your time? Make sure you take a card. Or a pen. So I've got my number on it. Take a mint. No, believe me, take a mint. - George, George? Where'd you go? - Oh, yeah, a documentary. No, no. Sweeney, couldn't be happier. That's great. No, terrific. - Oh yeah, that's what I said. I jumped all over it. No brainer. - All right, all right, I gotta go. All right, thanks. All right, bye. - So, I thought the show went pretty well. - You did great. - Thank you, you too. - I thought that your new stuff was great. - Oh, I appreciate that. - I thought it did. - Yeah. - Oh, anyway, so this woman comes up to me after my set, and she goes, "Why do you talk about your vagina so much?" I'm like, "Because I don't have a dick." Right? - So, what do you think of Sweeney? - Oh, Sweeney's great. I've only been doin' comedy a few years, but he's got me gigs. I've opened for him a few times. He's very helpful. - Are you wearing a bra? - Justin! - Hey, Sweeney. How ya doin'? So, last year, Sweeney and I did an overnight corporate gig up in northern Minn. You know, where everyone's related and share each other's teeth. We drove down together. Long drive, but we had fun. Show went great. I opened. Sweeney closed. Then we went back to the motel and that's when things got weird. So, we were sitting on the bed. One thing leads to another. And the next thing you know, we're talking about how much we got paid for the gig. That was a mistake, I know. Turns out we were getting paid the same. Sweeney was pissed. He thought he should be getting paid more. But I'm a good comic, too. I think he's jealous. In fact, I know he is. He should be. - So, did you and Sweeney... Were you a couple? - Me and Sweeney? Sex? No. No. - Are you wearing a bra? - Justin. - Are you wearing a brain? - Wait, wait. You gave Heather the Gutter Guys commercial? Are you managing her now? - No, I'm not managing her now. Technically. They needed somebody, she's hot right now. You didn't wanna do it. Remember that part. Yeah, I... Yeah, no. Hang on a second. I'm dealing with people that just stepped out of an IKEA catalog. Yeah, hasn't changed in nine hours. It's still oil heat. They were experimenting with the fire from a dragon. But the food costs were just too high. - Are you gonna film everything? - It's a documentary. I'm documenting. - Look, I'm done with this. It's just business. You gotta understand. - Good morning. - Yeah, what can I get for you? - I want a breakfast sandwich. I don't want it on a croissant. I want it on an English muffin, no cheese. - No cheese? - No cheese. - How about American? - No cheese. Are you gonna get this? You're texting. - I'm not texting, I'm Tweeting. You want cheddar? - I do not want cheese. Are you still Tweeting? - No, now I'm actually texting. But I have a good memory. I'll be right back. - Hey, Sweeney. Wake up and smell the powder, you back-stabbin' son of a bitch. - Here's your sprinkle donut. No cheese, just cheddar. - Are you fucking shitting me? - It's not a bullet wound. This is a scratch. They're completely different. Bullets leave holes. - It was Fitzy. It was Fitzy. - Oh, no! No, no. We're not doin' this again. - That was Fitzy. He tried to kill me. - Come on, first it was Jimmy, now it's Fitzy. What are you trying to tell me? That somehow, through some kinda magical spell or an alternative universe, the fictitious characters you've created for your own act, they've somehow come to life and they're trying to kill you? - Yes. - No, no, you're not doin' this. You're tryin' to sabotage the audition because you're afraid. - Look, I'm not afraid of an audition. - Yeah, maybe not the audition. But you're afraid of what you might find out, which is being Character King doesn't mean that much. That came out wrong. I'm sorry, I didn't mean that, Sweeney. I didn't. - It's okay, it's okay. That's it. I throw them out of my act, then they try to kill me. - You ever stop to think, Sweeney, that maybe there's a bookie or a jealous husband, maybe an ex-girlfriend, somebody real, might wanna see ya dead? - They all wanna see me dead. That's not what I'm talkin' about. The fictitious ones are the ones who are tryin' to actually do it! - Okay, you know what you need? - What? - You need a real shower, and I need to get us some coffee. Stop playin' with that. - Sweeney, my man! It's Justin. Just toon. Thinking about using that for my stage name. Uh, you're still comin' to my class, right bro? I'm almost done with my assignment. My dad's gonna proof it, make a few changes. I think you'll like it. I'm at my mom's. Call me back. Okay, bro. Brosky. Later on. - Ah, that's funny. George? You back? Mother fuckin'! Fuckin' Jesus, mother fuckin'! What the fuck is goin' on around here? Stay away from me, you old hag! Oh, not you, June. It's just someone's tryin' to kill me. Hey, say hi to Sal. - Was that Mary Ellen that just ran past? - Yeah. - She's even uglier as a real person. - I heard that. You're no box a chocolates yourself! - Now I'm takin' shit from a fictional character? Yeah nah, it's nothing big. You were lucky this time. - Maybe I should kill them. - Look, don't do anything stupid. If somethin' happens to them, doesn't summin' happen to you? - I don't know. I don't know how this works. - Okay, first thing we gotta do is cancel that audition. - Oh, no. That's exactly what they want. - Okay, listen, I got a cousin. He's got a place down the Cape. You go down tomorrow, you sit by the ocean, relax. Breathe some salt air. It'll clear your head. - It's gonna take more than salt air to get rid of these freaks. - Comics have a natural self-destructive nature. Why else would we get on stage in the first place? Other than to get laid. The thing is it's our subconscious that will do all sorts of things to protect us. Which begs the question, what are you afraid of? - I don't know. Failure. Success. Everything in between. - What about bees? I have this profound fear of all flying insects, but especially bees and the North American Wasp. In fact, I used to see a behavioral therapist and she had a tiny waist, and I end up thinking one day, "Well, how do I know that she's not with them? "Not their queen?" Anyway, the first week, she puts me alone in a room with three or four dead bees. And then a week later, six or seven live bees. And then I come back the next month and I'm alone in a room with a dead horse's head. I mean the head of a dead horse. I have to assume it was dead. And I don't like to beat a dead horse, but it's not the worst thing I've ever done. - He was amazing, really. He had no family, no friends, but he claimed that he was happy living under that bridge. Gees, the guy had a master's degree. He did not have to be under there, but he wanted to be true to himself. And I guess I felt a connection to him. To his passion. - Well, with all due respect, the guy's an idiot. - This might sound cold, but I don't know if I would've won that award if it wasn't for him dying. The dying is what really made that movie special. - Hmm. Now I had always heard that bird shit was lucky. - Guess not. Are you all right? - I gotta go. I gotta get outta here. - Whoa, what is it? - I gotta get outta here. - Talk to me. - It's hard to explain. The characters in my act have come to life. - They've come to life. - That's not the crazy part. The crazy part is they're trying to kill me. - What? - Well, they've already attacked me. My hand, my face. They've attacked me. - Okay, time out. So you're telling me that the imaginary characters from your act are trying to kill you? - Yeah. - What? Oh, my god, they're alive! - They're alive. They're like the living dead, except they were never alive. - Why didn't you tell me about his before? - I thought I was just going crazy. - For god's sakes, film festivals love stories like this. This could get me the Pom d'Or at Cannes. - Yeah, well it could get me killed. - Where's my camera? Can you tell me your name? - 'Course I can, I've known him for years. Oh, you want me to say it? Jimmy Yannel. I work for the Water and Sewer Department. - Can you tell me a little about yourself? - I just did. - I love to knit. I knitted a scarf, mittens. Right now, I'm knittin' a bathing suit. - So, are you upset with Sweeney? - Yes, I am. He throws us out of his act. He moves to Hollywood, what do I get? Nothin'. Knit one, pearl two. Nothin'. - Sweeney? Totally self-centered. Fascist, misogynist, xenophobic. Me? I'm riding a Nomad bike. I've got it right in the back of my Hummer. I'm doing a 60 minute bike ride to save the endangered mosquito. That's a bee. Don't even go there. - Are you married? Do you have a girlfriend? - No, I do not. But in 1974, I kissed Marie Akarelli on the lips for one full hour, and I can still taste her beautiful Marlboro breath. - I've been in Sweeney's act for 20 years. It's like a prison sentence, but without the prison sex. - Why do I wanna kill Sweeney? Well, let me tell ya, sweetheart. Maybe 'cause I can't stand the son of a bitch. Maybe because he's got no balls. Now, is that clear enough for ya, or would you like to spray Windex on it? - What the fuck? What do you want? - It's not what we want, Sweeney. It's what you want. - You want to leave us behind. - Hey listen, I just wanna grow, okay? - Grow? - How much taller do you wanna be? - Look at all this sand! I better start sweepin' now, even though it's not a Monday or a Tuesday. - If you would just like put us back in your act, Sweeney, we would like, just like disappear. - Look, I can't put you back in my act. If I put you back in my act, then I won't go to Hollywood, I won't get the cable special. - My frickin' heart bleeds for ya. - I'm tellin' your mother, Sweeney. - So much goddamn sand! - Look, it's not you, it's me. I love you guys. Come on, we had a lot of great times together, but it's over. Let it go! - I guess that's it then. - Okay, like goodbye? - Yeah, it's over. Let's kill 'im. Come on, Sweeney! Put 'em up, put up your dukes! - Put up my dukes? - Kill 'im, Fitzy. - 'Scuse me, rude to leave before we kill you. - Jesus, Mary and Joseph. - Now I know how a baby seal feels. - He's dead. I told him buckle your helmet. - Holy shit! You killed Marshall. - I didn't kill 'im. He fell. - He must be on crack. - Let's kill Sweeney, then we go somewhere else to bury the body. - Kick him in the balls, if you can find 'em. - Now it's your turn to die, Sweeney. All life started in the ocean, and you're gonna die in it. - Wait a minute. That's it. I created you all. All those nights on stage, all those shows. I created you. You don't get rid of me, I get rid of you. - He is on crack. - This is over. I want you outta my life, I want you outta my act. I don't wanna be a local celebrity anymore. I wanna be a big time celebrity. I wanna go to Hollywood. I wanna get a sitcom. I wanna get a cable special. Shit, I wanna get cable. I wanna be on the Celebrity Family Feud, the Pyramid. I wanna dance with the fuckin' stars! - Sweet Mary and Joseph, he has lost his freakin' mind. - I don't want you people anymore. I want you outta my life. Go back to where you came from. I want you gone for good. - That's what you want? - Yeah! That's what I want. You're outta my life. You're outta my act. Go away. It is over. - Sweeney kicked us out. What are you gonna do?

Comedy's like a curse. It's not that easy to just get rid of it. - So what happens if you don't get the comedy special? - Life goes on. I will always be able to put food on the table. Dishes, hoo, that's another thing. I've worked hard to establish a reputation locally, so I'm just-- Hold on. - Sweeney, it's me, yeah. I got you a gig for tonight. Yeah, it's not much money, it's two hours away. Some PTO thing. But at least it'll get you away for the night. You want it? - Sure. I gotta go, sorry. - Where? - I gotta gig. - Oh, well, I'll come. - No, it's not a gig gig. It's a shit gig. It's a two-hour drive. - Great. - Great? - Yeah. - Really? - Mm-hm. So, is this how you get most of your work? Last minute? - No. Yeah, well, sometimes. Sometimes, yeah. So Justin is with the dad tonight? - Yeah. - Divorce. Now that has gotta be tough. - Well, it's not easy. - Yeah. What happened? Did he cheat on ya? - No, of course not. - Oh, you cheated on him? - No. We just... - Ah. You grew apart. - No. We just didn't grow, period. So what about you, Sweeney? Do you have a significant other? Have you ever been engaged, married, divorced? - Let's just say mistakes were made. In July, I'm running a 100-yard dash for premature ejaculators. A little history of the race. It began as a marathon. And it became a half marathon, and then... Because they're premat... Do you ever get outta the house? You're the comedian on a cruise ship and people come up to you and say, "Oh, you stay "on the ship?" Oh, no. I swim next to the ship. And then when we're 150 miles out in the shark-infested water, they scoop me up, they dry me off, I tell a few stupid jokes, then they throw me overboard. Then I gotta swim back to catch my plane for the big gig here. This is Carla. She's a film maker. She's got a documentary, won a bunch of awards. Check it out. This okay? - Oh yeah, yeah. I'm fine. Thank you, so much. Good night. - I'm not goin' to bed. I'm gonna sit up and watch you sleep. - I don't know if I've ever told you this but I think you're really talented. - No, you have not told me that. Thank you. - Did you always know that you wanted to be a comedian? - I don't know. Yeah, well, I always made people laugh. It's like school, family, jobs. But bein' normal, now that's different. Phew, that's the challenge. - Well, you're kind of normal. - Well, I don't feel that way lately. So that's why I like to get on stage. I get on stage, I feel comfortable. But I don't really know if that's what I wanna do. - Well, I was just wondering, Sweeney, if maybe you wanna do this? - Yeah, that's what I wanna do. - Hey. You runnin' out on me? - Oh, no I didn't wanna wake you up. Yeah, I'm goin' out to get some coffee and bagels. - Mm. Do you want me to just make something here? - Sure. Do you have any food on you? - No. - I don't have any food. I don't have any food. I'll get some bagels. - Okay. Hey, do you happen to know where my pants are? - Your pants? - My pants. - Oh, I sold 'em on eBay. - Not again. - No, here they are. I didn't think you'd mind. - Thank you, Sweeney. - Sweeney! - Oh my god, it's Justin. I don't want him to see me here. - Justin, what are you doin' here? - You were supposed to come to my class. - Oh, shit! I forgot. - I had to tell my teacher you were dead, that you died in a hot air balloon accident. - Dead? Hot air? Are you shitting me? A hot air balloon? - I thought we were buddies. You let me down, you're a jerk. - I'm sorry. - Here's my stupid assignment. I thought you'd wanna read it. I don't want it any more. - Wow. - My dad's waiting. - Justin? Justin? I'll make it up to ya! Shit. - Hey, I'm sorry, Sweeney. He didn't mean it. Now I'll talk to him. - I think I'm quittin' the real estate business. Once you get this cable special, I think I'll be able to quit. - Are you sure you don't wanna sit down and eat that? - No, my doctor says I should be gettin' more exercise. - Do you wanna hear summin' crazy? - I have heard a lot of crazy things lately. - I think I'm fallin' for Carla. - Really? That's good. I like her. - Hey, no moves. You know how you are with the ladies. No moves. - My hands are full already. I wouldn't move on your move. Who taught you the moves? - You did, you're right. - I taught you my moves, now you use my moves. I would never use my moves against your moves. - Okay, I got it. Thank you. So, I went to the Museum of Fine Arts. First of all, some of the paintings are as old as the people that work there. But the art, it's abstract. So I'm lookin' at this one painting, just for like an hour and half, I'm saying, "Is it a man? "Is it a woman?" And that was just the bathroom. - Sweeney, you killed it! - Nice job, Sweeney. - Good set, Sweeney. - Thank you, thank you, thank you. - And you didn't even have to use your crutches. I mean characters. - You my friend are ready for this audition. I can see it in your eyes. - Please don't look in my eyes. - And you haven't heard from your you know who's? - No, I told you, they are gone. - Okay. This is gonna be a defining moment for you. Every comic has a defining moment. Mine was when I quit. Oh, I love comedy. It just wasn't for me. So I guess I live vicariously through Sweeney now. The recognition, the one-night stands. The 15%. - So, has Sweeney ever had a steady girlfriend? - Ah, not as long as I've known him. All his girlfriends have been unsteady. Can I ask you a question? - Sure. - Do you rent or own? - So, my mother still sends me money in the mail, which is weird because I'm 31 years old. And we live together. My mother had me when she was 17 years old. A junior in high school. My father was older. He was a senior. He was 70. - So do you have any pre-show rituals that you go through? - Sometimes I like to sit undisturbed, quiet, without talking. - Hey! - Hey Gene! - Hey, George, George! Sit down, sit down. How are you, baby? How's the real estate business? - Ah, it's good, it's good. - Really? I hear real estate sucks! - Yeah, it does. Hey, how's that beautiful wife of yours? - Oh! That broad's leavin' me. - That slut. She lookin' for a condo? - Oh, look it there. This guy, this guy! I love this guy! - Sweeney. Are you kidding, Sweeney. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sweeney, Sweeney, it's of course. My mind went blank for a second. A couple of cocktails, and you know. Oh, look who's it. Hey, Heather! How are ya, baby? - Hi, Gene! - Oh, how are you, sweetie pie? - It's so good to see you. - Oh, you look great. Doesn't she look great, huh? - Hey, what about my hug? - Ah. That guy! I love that guy! Is it? Funny guy. Come on. Gonna go on. Come on, I can't wait to see your set. I'll see ya later. Funny guy. I like that guy. - Am I that forgettable. - Oh, he just couldn't think of your name. Sometimes I can't think of your name. - My mother's only 59 and she's already starting to lose it. You know what I mean? She keeps forgetting things. She called me up the other day and asked me what an orgasm was. And I was like, "Mom, it's that euphoric feeling "that you get whenever Dad leaves the house." - I'm gonna do about five minutes between you and Heather. Okay? - Yeah, don't introduce me as the Character King. - Yeah, yeah, whatever you want Sweeney. - I used to work in an office. Constant sexual harassment. Of course, most of it was coming from me. Hey, Kevin, you look a little tired. Late night? You and the misses gettin' it on? What's your favorite position? Mine? Watching. Anyway, you people have cheered me up. Thank you very much. Good night. - Great fucking set, Heather. That new joke totally killed. - Good set. - Thanks. I left a few laughs out there for ya. - Give it up for Heather Chase, ladies and gentlemen. Let her know! Heather Chase! Very sexy. Very sexy Heather Chase. But my girlfriend, not sexy. No, not sexy at all! Listen, she farts when she has sex. At least that's what her father says. All right, on that note, ladies and gentlemen, your final performer for the evening. He's a local legend. Please give it up for Boston's Character King! Sweeney! - I told you not to say that. - Yeah, yeah, whatever you need, Sweeney. - Hey, how are you? Good to see you. How ya doin'? You look great. I know what you're thinkin', but I am not as old as I look. I did a lot of drugs in high school. Last week. I eat meat. Let me put it in another way. I hate fucking vegans. I like to get up early in the morning. I work out for an hour, that way, I get it over with for the whole year. Hey, can you be a little more careful with my career? This is a big audition. - I'm just tryin' to make a livin'. - Oh, shit! - Oh, man. Is he gonna be okay? - I don't know. Give me a shot of anything. - Okay, anyway, this guy comes up to me in the subway, he says to me, "Give me a buck and a half or I'll touch ya." So, I let him touch me. I'm a lonely guy. - Coming through, coming through, come on. Pick up the feet, pick up your feet. Coming through, coming through. This won't take long, funny man. Coming through. - Jesus, I need a shovel man. You can't sweep a street without a broom and a shovel. This is a five-man job. I'm doin' all five jobs. - Hey, why don't you say somethin'? - Hey, what's your problem, pal? You see what I gotta deal with, huh? All right, what were we talkin' about? - You were talkin' about your miserable life. - Oh, shit. - Why don't you talk about how you treat your friends, clown? Huh? - Hey, fuck you! - Fuck you! Oh, that's clever. Jesus Christ. Where's my pen? How long did it take ya to write that one? Wow, Shakespeare got nothin' on you. James Joyce. My god, he's green with freakin' envy. - All right. That's been my time.

Yeah, it's George. - I know. - Yeah, I talked to Gene today. He was a little hung over. But basically, he really liked ya. He knows you're funny. He knew the crowd was tired. He's seen ya kill before. He's a pretty sharp guy. They're givin' the special to Heather. I got a gig for ya. It's at a Crusty Pizza. Three-hour drive and there's a free slice in it. - No. - Hey? Do you wanna go outside and get some fresh air? - Hey, can you turn that camera off? - It is off. - Wow, you wanted me to fail. - What? - For your stupid movie. That's how it works. - What are you talking about? - You said it yourself. The other movie, the guy who lives under the bridge, if he doesn't die, the movie doesn't work. If I don't bomb, this movie doesn't work. - Oh, my god! Are you blaming me? - I'm not blaming anyone. I'm just saying, you wanted me to fail. - Wow! You know what, pal? I'm not one of your imaginary characters that's trying to kill you. I'm actually trying to help you. - You're trying to help me? - Yes. - By making me look like a loser? - You know what, Sweeney, there is somebody that you can blame. - Oh. Steven. - Sweeney. - What are you doin' out here? - Lookin' for my dog. - You have a dog? Hey listen, now that you're here, I'm goin' though all this stuff. This woman just walked out on me, I'm bombin' on stage, I want you to give me some advice. - My advice to you is to stop thinkin'. You're thinkin' too much. You take all this information, everyone, all this infinite amount of information. The brain has no end. It'll take everything in. You need to stop new information, take the information that's already in your head, meaning your whole life, and then push it to the side. You need to have no information. You need to have a blank. Not just nothin' for a little while. - Blank? - Blank, nothin' in your head at all. A few seconds here, a few seconds there. It all adds up. To me, I do it. It adds up to about 15 minutes a year where I have nothin' in my head. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, 15 minutes a year? - Yes. - I need help now. I want your advice now! - That's the perfect example of what I'm talkin' about. You're analyzing a year, now, 15 minutes. You see all the thinking you just did. You think too much. You need to have nothin'. Believe me, if I didn't do it, I would be insane. It works. Freddy? - Steven, you don't have a dog, do you? - Here, Freddy! Freddy? Freddy? - Sweeney? Open up. Come on, man, we gotta talk. Do I smell gas? - Bombing sucks. So I've heard. I'm kidding. We've all been there. But if you bomb, you move on. If you keep bombing, you move on to another career. - You bomb, you move on! You bomb, you move on! Hi, I found some pizza. - You found it? - I thought you had your head in the oven. - What do you want, Frank? - I gotta show you somethin'. You are gonna shit. You want some pizza first? - Oh, my god. - Yeah. - Sweepin' shit on the street is a lot like life. Especially if you're life is sweepin' shit on the street. - He's not even funny. - Wait. There's more. - When I was young, I used to love to listen to the Beatles. Not the band, insects. Now, for music, I loved Frank Sinatra. Oh, god, when he would sing "My Way," I'd say, "You can have your way with my way, "and I can go both ways." Yeah. - Funny stuff. - Huh? - No bullshit. - You're not gonna believe it. There's more. - More? - Watch. - Jesus, god. - I went to Catholic school with the nuns. I was talkin', they suspended me for three days, from the freakin' ceilin'. - Go back to where you came from. You ruined my audition, you're not gonna ruin my life. Get out. - I got news for ya, Sweeney. You already kicked us outta your life, 'member? You kicked us out, now we're kickin' you out. - You ready, Fitzy? - Sure, sweetheart. She wants a few tips on comedy. - Wait a minute, you don't kick me out. You don't exist without me. - That's the funny thing about this magical shit. It's unpredictable. Come on, baby. - Here's somethin'. 10 years ago, according to Geraldo Rivera, three Buddhist monks from a novel came to life while he was doin' a story in Tibet. - Yeah, but did they try to kill 'im? - It says here, yeah. Even the monks hate Geraldo. - Maybe that's what I should do. Maybe I should try to kill my characters. - You serious? - It's not a bad idea. They don't exist anyway, right? - Sweeney? Don't do anything stupid. - Listen, there's nothin' I can do about it. My hands are tied. They want Heather, they don't want you. - Listen to me, just ask them again. Ask them-- - I've asked them a million times. She's doin' a good job. Her stock is up. They want her. They don't want you anymore! - You my manager? - Of course. - You're fired. - Come on, Sweeney, 30 years. Sweeney? - Thanks for meetin' me. - You're late. What do you want? - I want to apologize. - Okay. - Are we gonna finish the documentary or what? - I'm sorry, did I miss the apology? - I'm sorry. Are we gonna finish the documentary? - No. I think we need to put that on hold. I've got other projects that I'm working on, so-- - Okay, so you're gonna walk away for no reason. - No reason? Right. - Hey, did you ever see this guy sweepin' the streets? Real loser. I know the bit, Frank. It just wouldn't come out. - I knew a guy in Cleveland. Always forgot his act. - I didn't forget my act, Frank. It just wouldn't come out. Something prevented it from coming out. I didn't forget the bit, Frank. - 30 years of comedy down the drain. - What are ya gonna do, Sweeney? You gotta do somethin', but what? - There's nothing he can do. It's over! - He can sweep. Come on, Sweeney, get up and sweep, sweep, sweep. Sweep! - I gotta kill 'em. Die, you piece of shit! - You gotta wake up pretty late to fool me, expecially on a Wednesday. - Where did he go? ♪ There is a big ♪ - Quarters!

Speakin' of kill, did I tell about this gig I did in Kingston the other night. I fuckin' killed. And I ordered a latte. - All right! Ladies and gentlemen, this next comedian is going to be filming her own comedy special. So without any further adieu, give it up for the very funny, the very sexy Heather Chase! - Wow, what a great crowd! Thank you. It's great to be here. Yeah, so I'm getting a network special. Thank you, thank you. It's really exciting, and I didn't even have to blow anyone to get it. But I did anyway. I'm superstitious like that. - So, this is your new project? Filming Heather? - I'm working. - Look, I said I was sorry. What else do you want me to say? - Well, for starters, how 'bout not blaming me for your failures. - I'm not blaming... Gene! Gene, I am so glad you are still here. - I gotta go. I gotta go to the bathroom. - Gene, Gene, Gene? Gene, listen. Gene? - What? - I apologize for the set the other night, for the audition. It was an off night. Give me another shot. Let me do another set. - You already had your chance. I gotta pee. Leave me alone! - Gene, I have been waiting 30 years for this! - I've been waitin' 10 minutes to pee! Get out of my face! - Gene, just five minutes! Just give me a set, five minutes? - Oh, my god, leave me alone! - Oh, it was them! They ruined it! They ruined it! - Oh, my god! What is wrong with you? Will you get outta my face? God, I hate this fucking job. - Thank you so much. You've been a great crowd. Thank you. Thank you. - I gotta talk. I don't know. Did I bring this on myself? Did I sabotage my own audition? Am I crazy? - I have a test for crazy. Stay with me here. It's the end of your life and God is standing in front of you. Little guy. And he says, "Sweeney, you've had a good life. "Now you can either come with me and live in eternal bliss "or you can live your life over again knowing "what you now know." Which would you choose? - Oh, I'd live my life over again. - You are fucking crazy. - I can't live with the idea of my characters runnin' loose out there. - Well, exactly. The longer your characters are out there, the less you will come to matter. - Huh. What? - So I've heard. - Wait a minute. You did this! Somehow, you made my characters come to life. - Sweeney, come on, me? Okay, you're right. I did it. - Now, it makes sense. You're the one who told me to drop the characters from my act. - I never said that. All I said was you needed to challenge yourself. - How'd you do it? - I can't explain it. Let's just say, in the world of animation you can pick up a few tricks. You needed a challenge, I provided one. - Okay, fine. You made them come to life, now you get rid of them. - I'm afraid it doesn't work that way. Actually, Sweeney, I'm lying about that. I'm not afraid. - Okay, what am I supposed to do? I lost the comedy special, I pushed my friends away and there's a bunch a mes out there tryin' to ruin my life. - Let me ask you something, Sweeney. What is it that makes you happy? - Ugh! Not this, not now! Happy. - Well, the trick is to let life be the journey. But let happiness, and this is important, let happiness be your shoes. - Oh, that is good. What the hell does it mean? - I have no idea.

Huh. He wears his celebrity status like a suit of armor. Nearly impenetrable. Scratched and scarred with mementos of where he's been and reminders of where he still wants to go. Huh. On stage, Sweeney is a long head at home, ready to do battle. The conquistador, hmm, in the center of the spotlight, hurling jokes like canon fire as he slays another crowd, another night, another show, another triumph in the monarch of the Character King. Conquistador. Justin, your little shit, you're a good writer. Wow. Not bad. - Were you gonna litter? - Give me that! What the fuck? What are you guys doin' to me? - You got nothin' to live for, Sweeney. - Get away from me, you crazy fuckin' creatures! Get away! Get the fuck away from me! You fuckin' crazy fucks! Get away! - Don't push him over so quick! I wanna get in a few more touches. - This make you feel good? You want it, then take it. Enjoy, Sweeney. - Oh, life. Life! Ugh. Life. Life. Life. Life. Life. Life. Life. I know what makes me happy! Killing! - You're not talkin' about me? - No! Killing! On stage! Comedy makes me happy! Being the Character King makes me happy! Impressin' some high school kid makes me happy! My life makes me happy! - You see for me, it's that second cup of coffee. - I gotta go. I know exactly what I gotta do. Jimmy? James Monroe Yannel? I wanna talk to you. I was wrong. I shouldn't a kicked you outta my act. If I go to Hollywood, it'll be with you guys! - You missed a spot. You don't know what you're doin'. You don't know how to sweep. - Jimmy, I always liked you. You were the first alcoholic I ever did. Jimmy, listen. How would you like to get laid in my act? - Laid? Really? - Jimmy Yannel on a date. - Not on a Monday or a Tuesday. - You're gonna be a funny bit. Hey, sorry for the whole school thing. - Whatever. - So, what are you doin'? You got another project you're doin'? - I had to find a new comic to write about. - Hmm. Heather? - No, her. - Beat it, perv. - No wait, Mary Ellen, I wanna talk to ya. - I got nothin' to say to you. - I want you back. Come on, Mary Ellen, I need ya. - Forget it, Sweeney. - Okay, fine. Have you met the new woman in my act, Margaret O'Sullivan? Oh, my god, Sweeney was right. You are a whore. - Who are you callin' a tramp, you tramp? - Another. - Why should I trust you? - Because I gave you life. Come back to the act. - Well, if you're gonna be a beggar, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. - Where'd she go? What did you do? - She's back where she belongs. - Oh great. Now I have to find someone else to write about. - Don't worry about it. You'll find someone. - Shut up, Sweeney. My dad's here. - Oh, god, my dogs are barkin'. Hey Justin? Come on, I wanna meet your dad. - You gotta wear the suit. You are Heather are like Mr. And Mrs. Leaf. - Right. How would you like to snap my twig? - Let's just do this. I got a flight to catch. - Fitzy? Me and you gotta talk. - Come on, Fitzy! We don't got time for this! - It'll only take a second. - I know why you're here, Sweeney. You wanna get rid of me, but you don't have the balls to do it. That's what I thought. - Come on, Fitzy. - Hold your horses. - Fitzy, wait. - You son of a bitch. - I don't want that shit in my documentary. - Wait, wait! Fitzy! I didn't come here to kill you. I came here to bring you home. If keepin' you out of my act means I won't go to Hollywood then so be it. I love ya, man. Come on. This makes me happy. - That makes me happy. See ya around, Sweeney. - Jesus, Sweeney, you all right? - Terrific. Hey, I'm sorry I fired you. - Oh, don't worry about it. - I do worry about it. You're a good friend. Hey, take this number. This is a guy lookin' for a condo. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - Hey! Hey, can I get a little help up here? - You okay? - Yeah, oh. Hey, I'm sorry. - Yeah. - No, no. No excuses.

No, that's great. Okay, thanks. Holy shit! - What? - I made the sale! - Wow! - Your ex is gonna take that condo. - No way! Oh, my god. He wanted to be closer to Justin. - This is so great. Thanks, Sweeney. - Ah. - Yeah, no, I gotta go make money. - All right. - That was really nice. - Well he deserved it after everything I've put him through. I guess I gotta go. See ya around. - Wait. Are we gonna finish this movie, or what? - Oh. - Thanks for comin', Sweeney. - Oh, no problem, I owed it to you. - I'll tell me teacher you're here. This is gonna be awesome. - Hey, Justin. - Oh, hey Laura, hey. - I'm really lookin' forward to your guest speaker today. - Yeah, cool cool. - See you in class? - Yeah, yeah, I'll be there. Bye. - See ya in class. - I'll see you inside. - I love you, sweetie. - Good kid. - Yeah, he is. So speaking of kids Sweeney, what are you gonna say to them? - Wow. Here's what I'm gonna say. After all the sacrifices, victories, the defeats, one day you're gonna wake up, you're gonna look in the mirror and you're gonna say, "Am I happy? "Am I really happy?" My mother used to say if you find a job you love, you'll never work a day in your life, and she lived by that. She got fired from every job she ever had 'cause she never showed up. Not my point. The point is talent without hard work is nothing. Talent without hard work is like you're wearin' a beautiful suit, but you have skid marks on your underwears. Talent is like a seed. You have to water it with hard work. So what are you gonna do? Are you gonna do the hard work? Are you gonna change those underwears? So when you look in the mirror, don't ask yourself how much money did I make. Ask yourself how much of a difference did I make. Don't ask yourself how rich you are. Ask yourself how much did I share. Don't ask yourself how much more is there to do. Ask yourself what more can I do? Then, when you look in the mirror, you are not gonna have to ask yourself if you're happy because you'll already know the answer. - That was beautiful. - Well, it's everything I ever learned from life and freakin' fortune cookies. Shall we? - Yes, definitely. - Sweeney! They want you! They want you! - Who wants me? - Gene. Heather broke her leg in like six different places. She's gonna be in a cast for months. They need someone to fly to L.A. right now. - What about my act? - You still can't do the characters. - Well, even though he bombed and beat up Gene? - Oh, Gene was hammered most of the night. Plus, he knows Sweeney's funny. Plus, they're desperate. Plus, they need somebody right away or they're gonna get somebody else. Plus, you've been working for this your whole life. - So what's it gonna be Sweeney? - See, this is what I'm talkin' about. It's a curse. - What? What are ya talkin' about? - It's not a curse. It's a choice. It's a choice I made a long time ago. I'm glad I did. - But does this mean that you're-- - I'm not goin'! - Have you lost what's left of your mind? - You're gonna turn down the TV special? - Yeah, and I'm okay with it. I'm happy. This is where I belong. Come on! I don't wanna disappoint Justin again. Oh yeah, do you wanna go to dinner with me tonight? - Yeah, I'd like that, but I-- - Yeah, great great great. It is never too late to be what you might have been. George Eliot. Oh, real name was Mary Ann Evans, but that's another story. George! Where's the car? - But I thought you were happy being the Character King? - I am, but this is my own freakin' special! George! Hey, do you wanna go to L.A. with me? - Sure. - All right. - Yes! - Sweeney? - Oh, shit! - You suck, Sweeney! - You suck, Sweeney! - George!
