Ah, good morning, Mr. Parsh. Good morning. Oh, Mr. Parsh, just a moment, please. Twenty-five cents, sir. Identification is my object, Mr. Slidell. Not amusement. But, you're... you're a private detective, sir, not a lawman with the privileges of a public servant. Twenty-five cents, please, sir. Well, you never got that close to them when they was alive, did you, Mr. Detective? How long did you hound these poor creatures, Parsh? Somethin' like five years, wasn't it? It sure is too bad you couldn't have been in on the kill. You'd have got a real pleasure out of seein' them out there in the dust. A-kickin' and a-screamin'... Whoa. Whoa. You stay here, Rose. Good morning, Miss Holly. Miss Rose. There's no need to ask any more questions, Mr. Detective. That's right, Holly. No more need for any questions. Just want to offer my condolences. Just leave us be. That's all. There's bound to be a certain amount of prejudice, miss. You and your sisters may need help. If we need any help, Mr. Parsh, you'd be the last man I'd ask. You sure put him in his place, Miss Holly. I've come for Paul and Uncle Grux. Well now, they're... they're all boxed and ready, Holly, child, but I don't see any special reason for hurryin'. You know, funerals come pretty expensive these days. And I thought, well, you might wanna defray expenses a little. And if I could help, why, I sure would like to. Well, I could do a lot of things for you. They suffered sorely, and was greatly put on. But the good Lord has seen their tribulations and forgiven 'em their sins. Please don't. I only wish to comfort you, my dear. Just as your Pa in heaven is gonna get comfort in the thought of all his loyal friends payin' their last respects in hard-earned cash. Will you shut up? Why, you little whelp. Don't you think I know what you and your sisters are as well as who you are? Is it a bigger sin to make a profit from dead bodies or livin' ones? Huh? Is it? Don't you come near me. Don't you touch me again. Regular old fire-eatin' Dalton, ain't you, Holly? And gettin' prettier and sinfuller by the minute. Put down that fork. No. Come on. You shouldn't have looked, Rose. Giddap! Trouble? No, just busted a trace. We'll have it patched up in a minute. Nothing to be alarmed about, ladies. You know, as much as I admire a maidenly reserve, dear ladies, aren't we carrying things a little bit too far? After all, we've been on the trail together now... Don't you find it stuffy in here, Sister? Oh, not especially. Whoa, whoa. There it is, baby. Holly, I'm scared. I've been on the run for the past seven years and I'm still not over being scared. I guess if I wasn't scared, I'd be tired. I don't like feeling scared, Holly. You'll get used to it. First time's always the worst. Better get in, ma'am, we're all set. It's such a nice day. Would you mind if I rode up there? I guess not. Way station's only 2 miles down the road. Giddap. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Howdy, ladies. Howdy. Didn't know there was anybody in drivin' distance of this station. Where did you say you come from? From back there. Is the westbound due soon? Eh, due now. She's never more than 15 minutes late. Er, whereabouts you say you come from? You better get the stuff out of the back before it gets forgotten in the rush. Yes, ma'am. Holly. Yeah? I think I'm gonna be sick. Come on over here. Too much heat? Homesick, most likely. She the one catchin' the stage? Could we get a drink? Er, whiskey or coffee? Water. She's just a baby. Can't you stop calling me a baby? Sure. Just as soon as you prove you're not. Now pull yourself together. Going to Denver, miss? Yes, sir. I won't be far from there myself. A little mining town called Dry Creek. Did you ever hear of it? Why, yes. I... I believe I read something in the papers. Wasn't gold discovered there? A month ago. Turned Dry Creek into a regular boom town. Are you, uh, a miner, sir? Well, hardly. No, I'm a businessman. I expect to open my own private enterprise in Dry Creek. Uh, permit me to introduce myself. Grey's the name, W.T. Grey. How do you do, sir. I'm Miss Denton. It's a pleasure, miss. May I say a rare pleasure? Thank you, sir. This is much less awkward. Do you mind? I suppose not, sir. Whoa. Ho. Whoa. Giddap. Ha! Er, little arrangement we got. To make sure it's safe to bring the stage on in. Can't be too careful nowadays. Especially when you're carrying gold. Hurry up, Dick. Bring them fresh horses in. Whoa. Whoa. All right, up with the hands, wrangler, unless you want a buttonhole in the back of that vest. Drop the rifle. Drop it. Too bad you had to try that, driver. You're a long way from a doctor. It's a holdup. Yes, sir. Toss down the strongbox. Marigold, watch over that stable boy. And stampede that team. Watch that that gambler, honey. He's slick. Stay back, mister. Now don't worry, miss. I have a great respect for ladies. Especially those with revolvers. Don't you want anything from me? Not even a kiss? You know, it's an old robber custom to steal a kiss. I'm asking you polite, Mr. Grey. Just don't try anything. Hold it. Just getting my watch, miss. This watch was a gift from my mother. I, uh, I feel sure that she'd want you to have it. Don't keep at me, mister. I don't want to shoot. Columbine. Get back up on that seat. All right, back up, wrangler. All right. Take it away, driver. The nearest telegraph is 25 miles away, so don't spare the horses. Giddap. Marigold, keep an eye on this wrangler. Come on, kid, get over here. Hurry it up. Care to try pickin' it up, wrangler? Stop it, Rose. We're getting out of here. What's the matter, honey? Been livin' too much alone? I bet you just tickle the girls to death with those whiskers, don't you? Hurry up with those horses, Columbine. Holly! Holly! You stick to the road. We're going back over the hill to see if anyone's picked up our trail. Right, Rose. Marigold, you take the dresses around to the shed and put them in the trunk. And I'll get to work on this box. Oh, it's you. Who's that? My sisters. Holly? And my sisters from back east. They'll be staying with us for a while. Gosh, I didn't know you had more sisters. Am I gonna have to meet them, too? Later. Ever see anything come off slicker? Regular old mail-order robbery, huh? So this is our humble home. Well, what did you expect for $10 a month, a plantation? Oh, who cares? A week from now we'll be in a first-class suite at the Denver Palace. Honey, you'll be lucky if you can afford a second-rate stall in a livery stable. Take a look. Is that all? All $148 of it in small change. Oh, no. What went wrong, Rose? I don't know. I watched that bank every day for a month. The payroll left on that stagecoach every week at the same time. Well, don't look at me. It's not my fault. Oh, we're not blaming you, Rose. On the other hand, you can't expect three rousing cheers. All the planning and writing letters, and the risk we took. And for what? Stop it, Rose. All these months I've been dreaming of California. Got so I could even smell orange blossoms currying a horse. Well, you can't expect jackpots in every game, honey. And you can't expect to be a lady, either. So stop dreaming and face up to it. You're a Dalton. I gave up those silly girl dreams a long time ago. But I'm not you, Holly. I didn't kill a man and run away. Don't you dare talk to your sister like that after all she's done for you. Easy, Rose. Anything special on your mind, honey? You just speak right out. You'll never stop thinking I should've given myself up and faced trial, is that it? And just what kind of a chance do you think a Dalton would've had in court, huh? I don't know. It's never been tried. That's dangerous kind of thinkin', Sis. It's even worse than dreamin'. I just didn't know you felt this way, Columbine. You've always been willing enough to go along with Rose and me before. All I've ever heard is how us Daltons won't ever get a chance to live within the law. I just don't think all people are that unfair, that's all. We'd sure hate to have you find out the way Holly and I had to do when you and Marigold were back in that fine school. Just how do you think we kept you there, huh? You're one of us, Columbine. You were born that way. You'll never be allowed to change. I don't believe it. And what do you figure on doing? I don't know. I wouldn't know where to go, what to do. I know what I'm gonna do, Columbine. I'm gonna get married. Married? It's kind of a sudden decision, isn't it, baby? When did all this happen? Just now. Back there. Joe? Who's Joe? He's a kid from the next farm. I rented this place from his father. How do you like that for a kid sister? Only been here a month and she gets herself proposed to. But a month is plenty of time for two people to fall in love. There wasn't much else for a sweet young girl of 16 to do. I'm not against the love part. Sooner or later it happens to all of us. But do you have to get married now? That's the way Joe wants it. Well, if that's the way he wants it, so do I. And what's wrong with marriage? I'd do the same thing if given half the chance. You go right ahead, Marigold. Thank you, Columbine. Baby, have you told him who you are? Oh, no, Holly. I haven't given you away. You know I wouldn't do a thing like that. I'm not thinking about us. I'm thinking about you, when he finds out you're a Dalton. I just won't tell him. He just won't have to know, that's all. Oh, yes, he will. And you'll tell him, all right, some night when you're lying there quiet with him there beside you. Oh, you'll tell him all right. And what'll he think of you then? Hey, it's Joe. Joe! Hey, Joe, wait. Joe, wait. Wait, Joe. Wait! Wait! Follow that kid. He'll scare up a posse. Oh, baby. Baby. It's okay, it's okay. Here. Sit down. Please don't cry. He wasn't worth it. Nothing is worth it but us. The family. We're all we've got. It'll never be any different. At least not until we get someplace where nobody knows us. Maybe we can go to California, like Columbine's always saying. Maybe there we'll have a chance. Glad to see you're back with the clan, Sis. Maybe you'll believe your elders next time they give you advice. Well, might as well put him out of his misery. No, no. I won't tell anybody. I swear I won't. Stop the teasing, Rose. Killin' him would give me a certain amount of pleasure. But you just go ahead and truss him up good. We'll be over the hill and far away by the time his old man finds him. You sure about that, mister? Well, frankly, I couldn't swear to anything. As far as I know they were men disguised as women. That was no man sittin' next to me. No, sir. Guess I can recognize a female member of the fair sex when I see 'em. You, uh, you can remember that far back, sir? They were nothin' but dirty, trigger-happy, little tramps. They were hussies. Shameless, good-for-nothing hussies. And I see no cause to stand up for them. Takes a hussy to know a hussy. # Oh, you can't trust a man # # 'Cause a man will lie # # But a gun stays beside you # # Till the day you die # # Oh, the birch and the aspen # # And the tall black pine # # With their roots in the mountain # # All the woods are mine # # But a man is a wanderer # # And his heart will roam # # But the birch and the aspen # # And the pine stay home # # Oh, the moon will romance me # # And the wind stroke my hair # # And the birds sing a love song # # But I know they don't care # # Oh, a man is a cheater # # With his triflin' ways # # But a gun's always faithful # # 'Cause a gun never strays # # Oh, you can't trust a man # # 'Cause a man will lie # # But a gun stays beside you # # Till the day you die # # Oh, a campfire will warm me # # And the sun kiss my cheek # # And the rain will caress me # # But it's true love I seek # # Oh, a man is unfaithful # # He will lead you to strife # # But a gun is my true love # # Yes, a gun is my life # # Oh, you can't trust a man # # 'Cause a man will lie # # But a gun stays beside you # # Till the day you die # # Oh, you can't trust a man # # 'Cause a man will lie # # But a gun stays beside you # # Till the day you die # Well, what'll we do now? No sense rushing head-long into nowhere. We ought to be thinkin' about another job. Any ideas? How about that new mining town out toward Denver? Dry Creek? Dry Creek. That's not bad. Dry Creek's fine with me. Should be plenty of cash and dust in a boom town. Then Dry Creek it is. For a look, anyway. You and Columbine clean up. Baby and me will bed down the horses. Baby sister's takin' the bust-up hard. A few more years, she'll toughen up. I don't think so. She'll never be like you and Holly. She'd better start trying. And you, too. You're so hard, Rose. Were things that bad for you and Holly? Were they really? There are things you can't talk about, not even to your sisters. Bad things you have to do. After a while you get to like 'em and it's easier that way. That man on the coach, Rose. Why did you call him a gambler? Because that's what he is. Don't tell me you're still thinkin' about him. What makes you so sure? He was introduced to me the last time he was in Dallas. He's Illinois Grey. Oh, honey, don't think about him. They tell me he plays women just like he plays poker. Riffle, shuffle, fast cut, big deal, the sky's the limit. Then all of a sudden you're lying there in the discards. So stop dreaming about him. You'll never see him again, anyway. He's in his office. Alone? There's a cashier. He's for you. Thanks. But what's the rush? We've only been here two days. The longer we stay, the more witnesses we meet. That livery man's already putting out feelers. If there were any likelier town, we wouldn't be here. So let's get going and get out. Is everybody clear? Right. You move in in one minute. Columbine follows in four. And I'll come around back in the alley as soon as you're ready. No shooting. And we should be back in camp with Marigold before the town spooks. Then over the hill. Ready, Sis? The man in? Uh, yes, sir. Oh, you startled me. Guilty conscience, Sewell? You're up and around early, Illinois. Yeah, there's nothing like the fresh, crisp air of morning for collections. Your IOUs, sir, from last night's game. Come to a little over $6,000, I believe. $6,000? You must've added wrong. You're not only a thief and a liar, Sewell, but you're a hypocrite. That's about the one kind of critter I can't abide. Why, all right, Illinois, I... I'll pay. I'll pay. Y-You'll get your money all right. When? Tonight. Now. I don't have that much. You're even a poor hypocrite, Sewell. You know, when you tell a lie, your Adam's apple starts to bob. Now, you got enough in that kick to pay off the Indian war debt. Shell out. That belongs to depositors, not to me. You know that. Look, I'll borrow it privately. I'll have it by tonight. Please? All right. Tonight. Don't try to sit in on one of my games again. Don't worry about me. No, sir. I've had my lesson. Well, good. Any time that I can cure a man of the pernicious habit of gambling, I feel that my own life has not been a total waste. Good day, sir. Would you please announce me to the manager? My name is Rose Duval. Wouldn't I do, Miss Duval? This is a private matter. Well, then in that case I... I don't think he'd mind. Go on in. Thank you. Yes? Am I disturbing you, sir? Why, no. No, not at all. Uh, come in. Have a chair here. That's right. Well, uh, now what can I do for you? Well, sir... Well, the beautiful bandit. Uh-uh. You don't get away this time. And no guns, please. Not again. I never meant to keep it. Can I please go now? Go where? I just found you. And you me. Don't make fun with me, sir. You know what I am. You and three other women held up a stagecoach. So what? You have to make your way on the frontier. It's more honorable than some others. And a lot braver. You've been on my mind. I'm not letting you slip away again. I must go. Please. What's so important compared to you and me? I have an appointment. I... I'm seeing a gentleman about work. Well, a job would keep you around for a while, wouldn't it? Give us a chance to get better acquainted. I don't know how to take you, sir. Name's Illinois Grey. Gambler. Not very moral, not very brave. But I don't welsh and I don't squeal. I'm my own law and my own man. I don't hold myself above you or you me. Now, who is it you're seeing? I know everyone in town. Maybe I can help. But I don't want to be a bother. It's no bother. I insist. Who is it? I forgot his name. Well, where then? Along the street here? Yes, it... it's just down there. But I don't want to put you out. We could meet later. Come. You show me the place. It's a fine day for good deeds and this will be my second before noon. After all, a woman in a bank... They have lady cashiers in Kansas City. The men seem to like it. Well, I'm sure I'd like to see you stay myself. Oh. I'll tell you what, my dear. Suppose I speak to some of my friends. Would you? Really? That would be just wonderful. But in the meantime, sir, a girl has to eat. If I could just have a small advance. Oh, just enough for a meal. Well, I think we can manage that. Stand where you are, Sewell. And keep your hands in plain sight. You'd better sit down, Sewell, before you fall down. You'll be working in no time. This old goat owes me 6,000 favors. I wish you wouldn't. Oh, I wouldn't go in there now, Mr. Grey. He's busy. See? There's no hurry. We could walk around the square. There's no need to do that. Come on. Why did you have to be so stubborn, Mr. Grey? You must be lucky at cards, gambler. You sure don't have it with women. I sure don't. Mr. Sewell? Men never learn. They always keep trying. Help! Help! Murder! Help, help! That's everything, girls. Let's go. Beat it, girls, I'll take care of the gambler. What're you gonna do? We can't leave him standing around in good health. And I know you don't have the stomach for it. Rose, you couldn't. I didn't invite him to be a witness. But not in cold blood. It's the only way. Hurry. No. Let's go, Columbine. Come on. No. Come on, Columbine, out. In here, Marshal. If it weren't for this, you'd be dead. Doc said the bullet glanced off the watch, ran through your side just under the skin. You'll be ridin' a horse in a week. Seems like an appropriate time to say something profound. Like about the big dealer up there who works in such mysterious ways. Feel strong enough to talk about the holdup? Yes, but not so inclined. Just one thing. How many were there? Three. Cashier says two women were in there with you and Sewell. They let somebody in the back door? I guess that's the way it happened. I wasn't conscious very long. Ah, that'll be enough for now. Got to get a posse together. See you later. Whoa, whoa. We're in luck. We spend all day playing the fox and win, that's not luck, that's old Dalton know-how. Okay, baby, get down and let the animals cool. We got a breather, anyway. Better than $6,000 in the saddlebags and I never felt dirtier or poorer. Hang on. It's gonna get worse before it gets better. Those two mopers don't help any. Just how long are we gonna keep the crepe hanging on the doors, girls? Don't start that again. We're all right, Holly. It's just we're tired, that's all. Well, so am I and so is Rose. But, gee, at least we look up, we crack a joke once in a while to help things along. Don't preach to me, preach to her. She needs it more than me. Rose did what she had to do. It was a piece of rotten bad luck, but it was them or us. Them or us, was it? Sure, it was them or us once we started the job, but did we have to start it in the first place? Wait a minute, who suggested Dry Creek? You, not us. You had to see that gambler again. If I only knew then what I know now. Don't you understand? Those men are dead because we started it. We started killing them when we planned that robbery. We started killing them long before that, Columbine. We started killing 'em when we were born. When we were born Daltons. You're wrong. You're the one that does the killing. Not me, not Marigold. It's you. And you. But mostly it's Rose. You're crazy. You, you kill like other women love. Stop talking about your own flesh and blood like that, do you hear me? After all I've done for you. I've raised you like a mother, sacrificed and sweated for you. Do we always have to shout and scream and fight? Why can't we just talk like other families? Peaceful and... and polite. If you don't stop it I'm gonna kill myself, you hear me? Baby, I'm sorry. Oh, it's all right, baby. Come on, honey, don't cry. Allow me to introduce myself, Mr. Grey. I'm Hiram Parsh, Continental Detective Service. So, how do you do, Mr. Parsh? I'd like to talk to you about that robbery, if you'd care to join me. Oh, I was just leaving town. Then I'll be brief. I'm looking for Holly Dalton. Never met the lady. She murdered a mortician several years ago and eluded the law. I was taken off of the case until we had reason to believe that she'd rejoined her three sisters. They formed a band and robbed a train near Joplin, Missouri. How interesting. I have further reason to believe that this case and the stage robbery last month in Eastern Colorado were perpetrated by them. Veritable Amazons, aren't they? Unless my memory fails me, sir, you were a victim of that stage robbery, too. Well, uh, innocent bystander would be a more precise description, sir. If you can enlighten me in any way, Mr. Gray, you'd actually be doing those girls a favor. Especially the younger ones. Come now, Mr. Parsh, you're a detective, not a father. Two of those girls are not yet beyond reform, sir. But they will be if they continue their present mode of life. As far as I know, the bank safe was robbed by one beautiful woman and two others who may very well be female impersonators. One of the impersonators did the shooting. Now, if you'll excuse me, sir. Learn anything? No. Didn't think you would. Mr. Grey impresses me as a man of rather secretive character. Would it be possible that he's a confederate of those girls? You detectives. You'd suspicion your own mothers. If necessary, yes. Ah, let me buy you one for the road, Mr. Parsh. It'd be a pleasure. Hi, honey. Come here. Hey, what's the idea? Sit down. Why you... - Hey. - Hey. Fellas, the alley's for horseplay. Deputy, let 'em finish their siesta in the jailhouse. Thank you, Mr. Grey. Welcome to Tombstone. Well, thank you, Mr. St. Ives. It's been a long time. Abilene, was it? Yes. What brings you so far west? Livelihood, among other things. The mines have been flooded out, a lot of cattle cash around. It doesn't look like it from here. Nickel-ante boys. The big games are played privately. Strictly cash and lots of it. I'm expecting to locate some friends with cash in a very few hours. Let me know when you want an introduction. I'm always around. Thanks. George, buy Mr. Grey a drink. Put it on my tab. What's the specialty of the house, George? Well, that'd be a New Orleans Fizz, Mr. Grey. My hometown. I'll have it and drink to better days. Hi, Doc. Winning? Rose. I never believed in miracles, Holly, but this sure shakes my lack of faith. We can't run. He'd be on us like a cat. Stay close to me. Well, good evening, ladies. It isn't often that we meet in an atmosphere so casual and relaxed, is it? Here, you recognize the signature? You followed us. Yeah. And it wasn't easy. But then they say it takes a thief to, uh... Pardon the presumption, ladies, I could hardly qualify in your class. Even though I may be a kindred spirit in larceny. Let's dump it right here, Illinois, where we can all see it. What do you want? $6,000. To buy your silence? It would help. The man you killed owed it to me. So it's mine by right of law, vague as that concept may be to you. There was only $6,000 in that safe. How touching. Oh, George, uh, pen and paper, please. Yes, sir. I can almost hear the wheels spinning in those devious and terrifying minds. You're probably desperate enough to try killing me right here. But here or there, you're a cinch to try. Thank you, George. So I will here and now prepare my last will and testament, leaving the legacy of what I know to my good friend, Sheriff St. Ives. In the event of my sudden demise, he'll know exactly who to apprehend and why. Do I make myself clear? You are a very clever man, Mr. Grey. We're mere women, putty in your hands. Yeah, well, just show up at 6:00. With the money. Now get away from me. George. Those two lovely ladies that just left, what do they call themselves? You mean you... you don't know them? That's beside the point, George. What do they call themselves? Alice Anderson and Louise Barton. Their address? Well, they live with a couple of other girls, it's out on the end of Fourth Street. White front house with red shutters and a little porch. I heard you were in town, Miss Columbine. I had to come by to thank you. Thank me? For your reluctance in having me shot. Oh, and for returning this in time. It saved my life. May I speak to you alone? Ever since that day in the coach, nothing's had much meaning. Even after what you know? You're no thief. I'll change all that. But you don't even know me. Not even my true name. You're Columbine Dalton. You have three sisters, two of them wanted for murder. Who told you that? A detective told me what I didn't already know. Parsh? Well, that could be the name. What does it matter who? It's the law. And it's closing in. Then we must leave. I... I've got to warn my sisters... No. No. I came to warn you, not them. You mean you'll take me away? Yes. You hate this. This running, hiding. Admit it. What are you trying to tell me? You haven't killed anyone. You couldn't, not even in self-defense, I know that. If you've stolen it's only because you've been driven to it. Made to do it out of some twisted family loyalty. But leave them now, Columbine, before it's too late. Before they drag you down with them. For your sake, for mine, make the break now. Leave my own sisters? This is the only way, it's the only reasonable way. But to go on as you're going, you can't last much longer. The only possible end is prison or death. Leave my own sisters when the... the law is closing' in? For a man I... I've only met twice? Columbine, listen to me. Let me go! You must listen to me! I've been dreaming, but I'm awake now, Mr. Grey. Holly was right. There are people like us and there are people like you. Oh, Columbine... Let me go! Here's some more hot water. You'll feel better, Columbine. You know what Holly says, a good hot bath washes away more than dirt. Whoa, whoa. Here are Holly and Rose now. Hand me the towel, will you, Marigold, please? Oh. Hi, girls. Hello, Rose. Hi. Hi. That gambler was here. We've seen him. What was he doing here? He wanted me to go away with him, that's all. The dirty rat, and after we promised him the money. Money? Claims the $6,000 we got in Dry Creek. And if he doesn't get it, he squeals. Oh, poor Columbine. You thought he loved you. Are you satisfied now where you stand? Where we all stand? I'm sorry, Holly. I thought you were just being selfish, that you didn't really care about us. I was so wrong. Well, I'm glad you see it. Oh, save it, Holly. What'll we do about the gambler? Let's leave, now. With his money? Why not? It's gambling money. He didn't earn it. He's not so honest, either. Listen, sure as you're born he'll have a posse on our heels. Look, if we're gonna breeze out of here, let's get out with some real money in our kicks. Oh, now, wait a minute, Rose. I mean it. Remember that game St. Ives was talking about? The one that goes on in the private room over the saloon? Where the game never stops? Where there's never less than $25,000 in the room? You believe that? There's a deputy at the door at all times. St. Ives guards the game personally at night. Would he be guarding chicken feed? Don't talk crazy, Rose. How could we ever hope to get into that room? Through our friend, the gambler. Look, as soon as we give him back his money he heads straight for the game. The money's his price of admission. It can very well be ours. It's worth it. I don't see it, Rose. How? Did you mean what you said about the gambler, honey? 'Cause it'll all depend on you. I hate him. Is that what you wanna hear? That's it. Oh, but look, Rose, even if we took the game, how could we ever hope to get out of town? Stampede all the saddled horses in the street. What then? Steal fresh mounts on our way to the border. Border? California'll have to wait. Mexico means safety. We'll come back when it all blows over. Hey, the border's less than a day's hard ride. We could do it. Sure we could. Let's lay it out. Right. Now, here's what we'll do. I'm Hiram Parsh. He's got a loose shoe. Can you tighten it? Another round of stud? Okay. All right. Let's ante 50 this time. Okay. And a three. A six. Another six, a five and a deuce for the dealer. Town's folded up early. I wonder what happened to the good old days? Fun and frolic around the clock. I'll take your hardware, sir. The others can take your money. Oh, good evening, sir. Would you care to sit in? Yep. Don't mind. Playing a little five-card stud. Everything's clear. I'm out. I'll stay. I'll bet $50. Well, let's call that $50. Make it $150 better. Good evening, ma'am. I must see Mr. Grey, it's urgent. With him? I can well imagine. I'll call. There's a lady to see you, Mr. Grey. Excuse me, gents. Hey, hold it a minute. Company. They told me you were here. I must talk to you. Can you wait till after this hand? May I wait here, please? I'm awfully glad you changed your mind. It's the only way. Your bet first. Yeah, yeah. Let's make it... I'll call. Okay. I'll see it. What do you do, Fred? I'll raise you $250. You're gonna like these. By me. Pass. I'll call, $200 more. I'll stay. You're sure dressed fit to kill, Alice. Where you going? Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies. Is my sister in there? Your sister? Yeah. I don't want any trouble. No trouble. I just want to tell her something. Hands up, everybody, and no funny business. All right, everybody freeze. Long as nobody tries to be a hero, the operation will be painless. Stand up, face the wall. Gather in the harvest, honey. Ready. You go first. You promised, Rose. Don't worry about me. Get out. Holly, don't let her. Illinois and St. Ives know us too well. It has to be. Let's not argue. Get out. If you pull that trigger, Rose, I'll kill you. I swear it, I'll kill you myself. Leave it, Rose. Do as she says. Come on. Come on, boys. You just got a new lease on life, gents, so don't break it by moving. Robbery, robbery! Robbery! Robbery, get those... Robbery! Stop those horses! Baby's shot. Rose, damn it! Holly. Columbine, you must bring her back to me. I've got to tell her I'm sorry. She must forgive me. Surrender, Rose! Never, you dirty, rotten... Got her. You forgive me, don't you? You don't hate me? Oh, Holly, don't talk like that. Holly. Holly! Holly! I want you to give yourself up. Is that you, Mr. Parsh? Yes, Holly. I'm so tired. I want to go home. I'm so scared and tired. Won't but somebody please take me home? Sure, Holly. Sure, we'll take you home. Well, I guess it's just in the nature of some people. Always have to make their point the hard way.
