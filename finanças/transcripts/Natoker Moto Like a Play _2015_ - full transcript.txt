Sorry I didn’t know. Sorry - No, no What’s the news ? After watching your Antigone, Sabita Singha has written... An amazing poem in the 'Daily Poetry' magazine Where did it go ? Here it is Let me read it Under the feet of a 17 year old girl, Can the world not fall once... just once... Just the entire world Not a faceless woman in a herd, But a woman of strength though breastless, stomachless... Dragged by the extra strong shoulders that stand straight defying adversity Extraordinary ! There is an ordinary decision that needs to be taken I would tell you, if you’d concentrate Should I ? I have translated Edward Albee’s ‘Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf’... I’d like to start rehearsals from next month Sir, what is the subject ? Human relations Oh ! Wow ! Read the play to us first Then we could take a decision And Antigone just got staged After directing Antigone, do I still need to read the play ? Don't you have faith in me? Amit Sir is right Let’s hear the play, then we can take a decision And Amit Sir read us his adaptation of... Tolstoy’s ‘The Power of Darkness’, just the other day Let that be staged first Then we can think about yours What do you say, Amit Sir ? - Idiot It’s a novel by Dostoyevsky I thought of adapting it We never had an ego clash We shared a sort of mutual respect Wow ! Beautifully said Mutual respect I need to tell my wife this She’s really… Where were you on the day of the incident ? In college Why ? Routine question It seems that your admiration for Amit Sir has increased No It’s the same as it was on the first day And yes, Amit Sir is my theatre teacher My on stage performance is completely his doing Good Under the feet of a 17 year old girl, Can the world not fall once... just once... Just the entire world Don’t stare like that Because Amit Sir said you quit your job, you sold your jewellery and gave money to the group What else did Amit Sir ask for Kheya ? So she used to write a diary ? Beautiful handwriting What a talented person… She has written regularly for so many years Did she never return to Prasad’s house ?

At first we had cheated the shot I mean she jumps from the first floor level of the launch...

Minority ? We are all a minority Kheya I mean those who do theatre We were so in the past, and will continue to be so in the future A minority Sorry Please don’t mind Actually I don’t like it anymore What will I live for ?

What happened Amit ? What happened ? This is Radio Akashbani, Kolkata You were listening to Instrumental Music Rabindra sangeet tunes were being played on the guitar by Botuk Nandy Today's play is ‘Nodeer Protik’ (The River’s Symbol) Written by Abinash Sen Solo-acting by Kheya Chakraborty Directed by Sabita Singha Are you listening ? Tell me Turn up the radio a bit - I’m coming Nodeer Protik We’ll all go together to that stream of water To the hidden stream of pride... In the sand, where we can find the water of salvation With that I shall fill our hands I have crossed the forests, Deep and dark... I have crossed the deserts, To come to the oasis I have skipped over the mountains, To come to this plain I’ll have my fill of golden water, Here’s the full moon… The group can’t only run on what you say We are losing 15 thousand rupees a month on running Rongopeeth We all have jobs, we can’t do 20 shows a month And ever since Kheya left us, we’ve had to do alternate casting for every play ‘Power of Darkness’, at this point is impossible What does that mean ? One man toiled to create this group and now does he have no importance to you all ? No, no I find logic in what Prasad Sir is saying Yes you find logic in everything that Prasad Sir says Don’t you talk to Priyabrata like that ! Don’t shout ! You can’t win arguments by screaming ! Learn to respect your seniors ! Don’t tell me all that ! We can’t do theatre all month ! We have families ! Don’t we ? You don’t love theatre Theatre ! Why do you do films ? Natokar is synonymous with Amitesh An individual is greater than the group ? - That’s the way it is ! Individuals stand out ! Let’s not mock democracy through these meetings ! Just say that "Power of Darkness" won’t happen ! Don’t talk rubbish ! Is that what was said ? Rubbish ! Don’t create an argument - You are creating the argument ! You didn’t let us do the touring theatre You prevented Rongopeeth All this is true He was not wrong Who wants to perform under my direction ? Raise your hands Minority Democracy Correct Kheya was right Power of Darkness Evil and good I won’t come to Natokar anymore I don't want to be with people like you anymore Evil and good Evil and good Evil... What’s wrong ? Won’t you eat ? Roma, some accidents may be suicides But every suicide, is actually murder No, no, no There is no link between Kheya's death and Amitesh's separation from the group He wants to do the play in his own way So let him No, no, my theatrical vision wasn’t matching his Do you’ll want to make news out of this ? No please don’t involve me in this No, no, Mr.Hazarika this is not Sweden This is a German theatre project No. I had told you Ok. I’ll call you later Ok...ok Come in Sit I’m Ditipriya I know. Priyabrata told me We are adapting Brecht's ‘The Good Woman of Setzuan' It’ll be nice to have you on board So have you read the script, the original text ? Yes, I have - Good, good This production has been done here before... But I didn’t like it so I’m doing it anew You are the main character You’ve been outside Kolkata for a long time... I hope your Bengali hasn’t deserted you No, no I have acted in Bengali plays at Delhi Very good I am redesigning the play I just heard, the other day riding the waves You have touched the deep blue sea and the horizon I just heard, the other day along the briny shores You have wandered a thousand thousand miles I have, never been to the sea neither glided on the blue Nor ever caught a glimpse of flying seagull's wings Whenever you go next to immerse in the seas, Do take me along, please Will you take me along? Say...Will you...? I just heard, the other day you, you and you together Had a meeting of a so formed council And on the same day, you debated many riddles And had raised more than a few unspoken words Why this eternal grind, saying same things so many a time And living for yourself, holding yourself tight Imagine, if there is no Love to be found, only loneliness, Be so profound, where do I go to find my peace? Where do I go? I have heard that you still care to dream Still care to write, and still sing songs from your soul Still You think about life and death, the eternal circle And your Love still blooms in lush red Roses I have brought my wrecked heart, this deserted soul With wide open arms, I’ve come begging before you It’s just isolation in the void of my eyes, Ain’t no dreams in my sleepy nights So, to catch up on a dream... I have undone my eyes... I have come to you, with arms open wide To catch up on a dream, I have undone my eyes
