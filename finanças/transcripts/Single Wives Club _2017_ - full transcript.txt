Divorce does not exist in my culture. It was the most difficult thing I've ever done. I had to bury my husband only a couple of days after my son was born. [sighs] Ending my marriage at 25 wasn't part of the fairy tale that little girls dream of. I idolized my husband. I had him on a pedestal and there is nothing I would not have done for that man so I was absolutely devastated... when it all fell apart. [Fifi] These four women have all been married before and now, they're looking for love second time around. [Sunnie] Putting my heart on the line is really daunting and I'm definitely not prepared to have another failed marriage. [Sheridan] The whole dating scene scares me. I need to put myself out there now. [Fifi] Over the next four weeks, they'll all join forces and be guided by the world's best dating expert, Matthew Hussey. I've had the privilege of coaching top female CEOs, people like Tyra Banks and Eva Longoria are fans of my work. [Fifi] He'll take them right back to dating basics. [Matthew] People always ask me where are the great men? They're everywhere. You just don't know how to meet them. Matt, I can pick up. I can't keep 'em. [Fifi] He'll give them tips on how to text. [Sunnie] When's the right time to message back? It doesn't matter. - [Sunnie] It doesn't matter? - [gasps] It doesn't matter? [Fifi] And advice on how to impress. [Matthew] A date is a trailer for the movie that is you. So if someone's not enjoying the trailer, they're never gonna watch the whole movie. [Fifi] But today's world of dating is harder than ever. Can we just sort this out now? No, we can't shake before you have told me what we're sorting out. I am telling you to be quiet. Oh! Matt, this is bullshit. What am I doing here? You look pissed off. I am pissed off. You know what I'm like. In fact, I am that far from going home. [Fifi] They've all had their hearts broken. You don't walk into your wedding day thinking this is gonna end. Oh, I can't do it. [sobs] [Nikki] Everything is freaking me out. [sniffs] I just want my old life back. [Fifi] And now it's time to find Mr. Right. [Sheridan] I can't tell you how many sleepless nights I've had and red wines thinking about this. Wing woman! I am madly in love. There are secrets to getting your happily ever after. This is it. [all] Whoo! Wanna know what they are? [laughter] [Fifi] Today marks the beginning of a modern suburban fairy tale and it all begins here in this house. Our single wives will live under the same roof for the next four weeks, and first to arrive is Indian divorcee, Sunnie. [Sunnie] I got married very young. I thought at the time the love of my life. Unfortunately, after a year of living together and integrating with the family, it just... it just didn't work. This is beautiful. Ever since then, I have been looking for Mr. Right. Hopefully he is out there. [Sunnie] My marriage was not what I expected it to be. He was very traditional and that made a big impact on how we viewed things. My divorce was really upsetting for my family. Like, divorce doesn't really exist. You just push through and you make things work. That's the... that's the way they're brought up. I was just a kid, so I think it definitely made me grow up. I know that life's not all rainbows but... definitely want the happily ever after. Yeah, absolutely. [Sheridan] My first marriage resulted in two beautiful children and we were married for just over 11 years but we just fell out of love. Hi! Hello. How cool is this house? Oh, it's amazing. Hi, I'm Sunnie. - Nice to meet you. Sheridan. - Hello. I'm Sheridan. [Sheridan] Then I met my second husband. - How cool is this? - It's beautiful. It is actually stunning. [Sheridan] Is anyone else here? We were married for 18 months and he made me feel like a princess right up until everything started to unravel. Well, what does that mean? Circumstances beyond my control - is probably the best way of putting it. - OK, OK, fair enough. [Sheridan] He was emotionally unfaithful to me and then I felt like the fattest, ugliest person in the world. Which is horrible. [sniffles] So who are you hoping to meet? The man of my dreams. Do you think they exist? Well, I hope so. - Yeah, it will be interesting to see. - Yeah. [Sheridan] I don't need help attracting a man. I just need help attracting the right man. It's cougar town for me. - Really? - I get the 20-somethings - and I don't know why. - How old are you? - Uh, 41. - OK. Oh, you don't look 41. No, I know. [Emma] I really do think I did the right thing by getting divorced because I got married really young. I was 20 and a big part of that was my church upbringing. You didn't live with your partner until you were married. You didn't have sex until you were married. Rules, rules, rules, rules, rules. And it was probably about 12 months after we had gotten married, living normal life together that I realized I wasn't in love with him. [all] Hi! How are you? Hi. I'm Sunnie. Nice to meet you. - I'm Emma, lovely to meet you. - Hi, Emma. [Sunnie] Lovely to meet you. - Oh, I am so excited about meeting you. - I'm Sheridan. Hi, Sheridan. I'm Emma. The day I left my marriage was full of mixed emotions. I knew I was breaking his heart and I didn't want to do that. How crazy is that? This is home. The way I live my life now, it's not religious like that at all. So I felt this incredible sense of freedom. Hello. [all] Hello! Hi, how are you? How are you going? - I'm good. I'm Nikki. - You look amazing. You all look amazing. - Sheridan. - [Nikki] Sheridan, lovely to meet you. - Hello. I'm Emma. - Hi, Emma, lovely to meet you. - You, too. - Hi, I'm Sunnie. Nikki. Sunnie, lovely to meet you. You guys are all gorgeous. - So do you! - [Sunnie] So do you! [Emma] So, Nikki, what's your story, babe? You're divorced? Ah, no, I am actually originally widowed. Yeah. - Oh, wow! - OK, what happened? It was a long time ago. Um, about nine years ago. We were very close in high school. Well, the marriage didn't end. Our journey ended. He was actually tragically killed in an accident. Uh, a motorbike accident. You were on the motorbike as well? No. No. I was actually heavily pregnant at the time. And, uh, the stress caused me to go into early labor. He was born four days after he passed away. - Oh, my God. - [Sheridan] Oh, my God. [Nikki] It's supposed to be the happiest time of your life having a child. But having a death, a birth, a funeral in one week... sort of puts a bit of a spin on... on that. Oh, babe. [Sunnie] You are so brave. I wouldn't say that, believe me. If you met me six years ago. Oh! [Nikki] You know, it was... It's time for me to move on and find somebody that's for me. Yeah. [Sunnie] I just want to do this. [Nikki] Oh, that's so lovely. [Sunnie sniffles] Oh, wow. [Fifi] All our ladies are here in the search for a more promising future and the path ahead won't be traveled alone. Oh! [all scream and laugh] [Fifi] I'll be here to hold their hand every step of the way. Hello. Oh, my God. How are you? [Fifi] Over the next four weeks under expert guidance, our ladies will master the art of dating. - Nice to meet you. - [Fifi] Hi, Sheridan. They'll meet men... So, welcome! ...date men... How are you all feeling? ...and with any luck, find a special someone to share their life with. So we just met, you know, each other and it's a huge deal. This is a big deal because it's so brave of you. Honestly, I commend you all because you're all coming for the same reason. You've been married before and now you're... you're very bravely putting yourself forward for a second chance at love. And it all starts right now. Get ready because very shortly, you're going to be meeting the best relationship coach on the planet. He's amazing. His name is Matthew Hussey. [gasps] Yes! Matthew Hussey. He is amazing. Oh, my God. I'm a subscriber. He is like king. He is a good one. He is the one you turn to. He is amazing. Love life strategist Matthew Hussey! [woman] Matthew Hussey is the world's leading expert in attraction and love and he has coached over 19 million women. I have spent the last ten years of my life working with women all over the world. I wrote a book called Get The Guy that became a New York Times best seller. We're going to have a date, all right? Oh, my gosh, we're doing a date! I've had the privilege of coaching top female CEOs. People like Tyra Banks and Eva Longoria are fans of my work. What I do is about giving people practical advice that they can act on today so that when you find the man of your dreams, when you find that amazing relationship, you're ready for it. I can't believe we are meeting Matthew Hussey. I am just going to be star struck. It will be interesting to have someone like him pick up on what we're doing wrong. [Matthew] I'm here to help four incredible women find love again. It's like angels pissing on your ears really, the way he talks. They've all been brought together by one common link. They have all been married before. They developed a relationship and made a pact with someone that they thought would last forever and it didn't. [gasps and giggles] Hello! What they're gonna learn is that in going out there and doing that again... [screams] Stop it! ...it's not about finding your fairy tale. Oh! Wow! It's about creating your fairy tale. In my house you're just Hussey. You are just Hussey in our house. - I like it! - Hello. Each one of these women is about to do that. Well, basically, I need all the help I can get, really. OK. Meeting the guys isn't always difficult and even the first date or two is OK. But it is sort of after that that it just, it all falls apart. How about yourself? So, I have no problem meeting men at all. Street corners, Coles, which is a supermarket in Australia, I have no problems, right? But I attract the ones that are on the rebound or I have started to become the cougar out of my friends. Inadvertently, and I don't know why. These are the perils of being an attractive person. It's a hard life, isn't it? - [Matthew] It's people keep calling. But I would like to find someone normal. Taller than me, a certain body shape and I'll know within 30 seconds. If I don't want to rip their knickers off, it's not happening. Interesting. - Straight away. - All right. Look, ultimately, life doesn't hand us a fairy tale, right? We have to create our fairy tale. - Yeah. - [Matthew] Right? So, what we're going to do today is something that is actually going to kick-start everything. I am curious to know if I gave you 100 guys, how many of them do you think you would be attracted to? - It's tough though, right? - A couple. It might be 20 that you are attracted to and that would be probably very optimistic. - Yes. - And of that 20, how many could you not just be attracted to, seriously date, but you could actually see yourself spending the rest of your life with? - One. Well, maybe zero. - Optimistically zero. Not many. How long is it going to take you on those numbers to meet someone you could actually spend your life with? This is hard. It could take you a lifetime or more. You would need to live five lifetimes. Yeah. So today, you're not just going to go on one date... you're going to go on ten dates. - Ten dates? - Ten? - Ten dates today? - [Sunnie] What, each? [Nikki] Dating ten men in one day, yeah, look, I'm a bit overwhelmed. Each of you are going to go on ten quick dates. OK. [Sunnie] It's a lot. Like, there's ten. Yeah, it's scary. [Fifi] That's right, ladies, ten dates each. That's 40 eligible, single men, right here, looking for the perfect woman. [Sheridan] Ha, your face. - They're here? - Yeah, they're here, babe. - [Sheridan] Oh, my goodness. - Far out. I'm looking for someone who is loving, caring, funny, that I'll get along with for the rest of my life. I just want to find true love. Is that so hard? Very excited and looking forward to the conversation... and also nervous as shit. Ahh! All right, guys, good luck. [Emma] Thank you. [laughter] [Fifi] These four women who've all been married before and are looking to find true love a second time around. [Sheridan] I've had two failed marriages so I need to find the right man for the next time. [Fifi] To get them started, our ladies have been matched with ten different men each. They will date them now and then re-connect later tonight when everyone will come together for a singles mixer. Hi. - How are you? - Great! Game on. They have started. [Fifi] And joining me to watch on and share his secret tips on dating is love expert, Matthew Hussey. Hello. Everyone always asks the question "Why didn't I get the call back after the date?" Well, we might actually see why. [Fifi] He will observe the girls... So why are you here? [Fifi] ...and tell them where they're going wrong. This is me throwing them straight in the deep end. Because although I intend to do a lot of work on their confidence, it's also about competence. How well we actually date and they have a crash course today in dating. [Fifi] Single mum Nikki is today dreaming of a fresh start. After losing her husband in a motorbike accident nine years ago, she's now ready to fall in love again. [Nikki] I'm sick and tired of being the victim. Everybody seems to have looked at me all these years as this poor girl who lost her husband so young and had a child four days later. I don't want to be that person any more. That's beyond me now. I am not that victim. Definitely time to put it behind me and just move forward. [Fifi] She's here chasing a second shot at her happily ever after. - Hey, how you going? - Hello, how are you? - James, lovely to meet you. - James. - I am Nikki. Nice to meet you. - Awesome. [Fifi] But she's been a long time out of the dating game. Tell me, you, you're here. - I'm here. - You're here. - You're here, too. - I am. So why are you here? Oh, look, I'm here because... Why am I here? It's not easy, right? Meeting new guys and doing it under these circumstances. It's tough. What else? Tell me, we don't have much time unfortunately. Hopefully Nikki is just getting warmed up right now. - [man] G'day. How are you going? - Hello, how are you? - What's your name? - Uh, Chris, sorry, nice to meet ya. You've been married before? - No. No. No marriage. No kids. - Nothing? It's a fairly intense question for minute three. [Fifi] She dropped it like a hand grenade. [Matthew] It is like a bit intense. I don't know if relationship history is that important right now. Yeah, you're right. I've got a little boy. He's nine. All right. Oh, that's cool. Nine-year-old's great. He'd be doing motor cross now. He'd be old enough for doing motor cross now. Motor cross, what is that? Motor cross? Motorbikes, racing, track racing. Oh! Yeah, no. It's funny you say that. Uh, his father actually passed away on a motor bike, so... Oh. Sorry. No, that is why I won't let him on one but... He loves them. My poor son. But I've got a huge fear of them. For obvious reasons. The fact that she is saying on a first date that her husband passed away is not a huge deal. It is a part of her life. But if she right now is ready to move on and meet people then that doesn't need to affect the mood of the date. Yeah. - And that was it. - [Chris] That was it. There is a lot of real amazing dudes here tonight that will blow me out of the water, so... - [Nikki laughs] - Very nice to meet ya. - Great to meet you. You take care. - You too. - See ya later. - [Chris] See ya later. Thank you. - Thank you. See ya. - [Chris] Bye. [Nikki] Somebody give me a break. Somebody give me a break. She does look like she's on the verge of tears. I feel like I want to go and give her a big hug. Finding their way back into the dating world is tough for all our single wives. And Emma is no exception. [Emma] I know that I got married way too young and I think about the girl that I was when I was 20 and genuinely wanted to do my best but I can look back now and really look at my face and just see my inner self going, "Oh, this isn't quite right" and that I wasn't in love with him. [Fifi] That fateful decision ended in divorce three years ago. Since then she's struggled to find love again. [Emma] I think I'm single because, look, I can be hard to handle. Like, I'm a big personality, so... [laughs] but that comes from, you know, having been in a marriage and it hasn't worked out and I do not want to go through it again. So I want to make sure that the guy I settle down with that he's the one. [Fifi] And could that "one" be 34-year-old Brad? - [Emma] Hello! - Hi! - Nice to meet you. - I'm Emma. - Nice to meet you. - Lovely to meet you. - What's your name? - Brad. Brad! - Great to meet you, Brad. - Likewise. - How are you feeling? - I'm nervous. - Nervous? - Yeah a little bit nervous. Don't be nervous. What's your relationship history? Uh, three in, say, the last 15 years, three relationships, all long. Longish. Do you know why they ended? Like, what happened? Do you know, like, self-reflection? [Matthew] We're on a first date talking about dating. Do you know what I mean? Like, it's a bit too on the nose. Have you been dating? Yeah, I've been on some dates. Yeah, so what are you looking for in a woman? In a relationship? Um... [Matthew] Asking question after question, not necessarily giving anything back. 'Cause what creates a connection is you say something and then I get vulnerable and I contribute. I learned something from every relationship. In what way? She's not doing that. As soon as he has answered, she asks another question. It's an interview. So what do you think you did wrong then, if you can see your part in the break up? What are we doing? 'Cause I think when you've been hurt, you... you just want to know. Like, are you a jerk? - I'm divorced and... - Yeah? ...it wasn't easy. Have you been heartbroken? Like, are you bitter about women? You know, you just, if you, you just want to know. - Lovely to meet you. - Likewise. Thanks for coming. [Emma] I don't think there was a connection and he didn't ask a lot of questions to me but he's a nice guy. But see, this is the thing with my ex-husband and I. Lovely guy, beautiful man but no connection. And not going there again. See ya. [Fifi] Here to prevent history repeating itself... [Emma] Oh, hello. Found my way over to you on these rocks here. [Fifi] ...is Matthew with some dating tips. [Emma] Thank God, you're here. I'm surprised. Oh! All right, talk to me. They don't ask questions. Hmm. And I feel like I really need a guy, who in this kind of scenario, is confident and can talk. So... what you're saying is exactly what I picked up on. - That you're going into interview mode. - Yeah, I am. You can ask a question but when he gives his answer, even if he doesn't say, "What about you?" I want you to give your answer. Sure. OK. Like, there's talking and there is connecting. [clicks tongue] I like that. And lastly, I want us to stop talking about dating - and relationships. - Oh, really? - Yes! - But I want to know! You've just known this man for three minutes! Yeah, but I want to know. Like, I want to know what he's busted up... You can't learn that in, like, the second twenty minutes? OK. Right now, here is all you need to know. "Do you and I have fun together?" Yeah. OK, don't rush it. - Yes. - OK. Thanks. Hug it out? - OK, have fun. - OK, thanks. - I'll see you in a bit. - All right. All right. I'll see if I can... OK, OK. I'm feeling good. What Matthew's picked up from these dates I did notice some of it. Um, some of it I didn't though. Um, obviously he's the expert. I'm not. So, um, I can hear where he's coming from though. I can see what he's saying. So I'm willing to listen, you know? Willing to learn. How about Sheridan? [Fifi] Sheridan has been married twice, but it's the breakdown of her most recent marriage that has left the deepest scars. [Sheridan] One of the reasons my marriage ended was because of trust issues. And I don't believe that our marriage was based on the truth. There are other people and influences involved. So now if there's any sort of twinge with me that someone isn't right, I'd cut it off pretty quick. I feel like Sheridan is gonna be very hard to find somebody for. - I think so. I think so. - Hmm. [Fifi] And first to go under the microscope... - [Sheridan] Hi. - Hey, how are you? [Fifi] ...is 34-year-old Welsh born Chris. - How are you? - I'm Sheridan. Oh, an accent! Yeah, I'm Welsh. Ah, what brings you to Australia? Yeah, I'm a citizen. So I've been here for thirteen years. - Yeah. - I remember the day I went to do my citizenship thing - and we all sing the national anthem. - Yeah, the national anthem. And because I'm so patriotic about being Welsh, I had to mime it. Oh, it pissed me off when he said that. But you became an Aussie. That really pissed me off. Yeah, but I will always be Welsh though. Yeah, that's a... That's a contentious issue. I could feel my blood start to bubble over. Well, I think I have got to move on to my next person now. Oh, do you? All right. Cool. I think she's just called time. Thank you for coming. No problem. [Matthew] I think that's hasty. She could have still just had an interesting interaction with the guy. - Enjoy your day. - See ya, doll. I think he'd be awesome for someone that was pretty vanilla. Ooh! But not for me. - Hi. - [man] How are you? - Nice to meet you. - Great to meet you, too. Hi! Oh another accent. Uh, no. Aussie. No? Oh, you sound like there was a slight accent there. Why am I being set up with all the short people? - Mwah. - Really good. That's a nice shirt. It suits you. Well, thanks. [Sheridan] It's like Danny DeVitos, they're all coming up to my boobs. - Nice to meet you. - Hi, lovely to meet you. - How are you going? - Well, thank you. - Well, thank you. Take a seat. - Good, good, good. And I'm very big on teeth. Sheridan is massively dismissive. I'm a firefighter. That's my career. Up here, they don't seem to do much though. - They kind of lift weights and... - Oh, we're always doing something. ...drive around in a truck in a circle. - She'll cut dates short. - Mm-hmm. - I should let you go. - Sure. - I think there's a time limit. - Yeah, yeah. She has no poker face. - Thank you for coming today. - Thank you. [Matthew] I also think she'd want the benefit of the doubt from somebody else. - Yes. - You know? She's not prepared to give anyone else the benefit of the doubt. [Sheridan] My second husband was unfaithful to me emotionally and so there's really no flexibility in my way of thinking when it comes to men. Great. Well, I'd like to get your phone number. Well, I think we're doing a mixer later, aren't we? - OK. - And that's when we'll do that point. What is she thinking? He's perfect! - That's what I was... yeah, anyway. - [Sheridan] I think that's what we do. - I think that's the process. - OK. Poor guy. - [Sheridan] So I'll see you later on... - All right. ...at the, um, at the mixer. There's something more under the surface with Sheridan. I don't believe that she's just... - [Fifi] Mm-hmm. - ...like, a vacuous person. I think there is something going on underneath it. Thank you. That's making her quite guarded. Are you free for a date? I'm running out. Hi. [Fifi] Four women who've all been married before are making their way through ten dates each. [Sheridan] You, too. - Uh. - [Nikki] Dating ten men in one day, I've never done such a thing. - I'm Emma. - Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. [Fifi] In the hope of choosing one lucky guy to date tomorrow. - Not a problem. - [Sunnie] I'm quite nervous. Like there's ten, boom, boom, boom, boom. Like, it's a lot. [Fifi] And watching on to share his dating tips... is love expert, Matthew Hussey. [Matthew] If you look at what dating is, right? It's meeting new people... Hi, lovely to meet you. [Matthew] ...with the hope. That one of those new people will turn into something more. - [Sheridan] Sorry, what was your name? - Adrian, sorry. - Hi, Adrian. - Yeah, yeah. - How are you? - Yeah, great thanks. Most of us either put on a fake version of ourselves or we just hold back completely and get shy and introverted. How embarrassing. This is so nerve wracking. If they don't show the best version of themselves, they're not going to get the call anyway. So I want them to actually put themselves on the line today. - [man] Hi, Sunnie. - Hi, how are you going? - Nice to meet ya. - Nice to meet you, too. - What was your name? - Matt. Well, Matt, that is really easy, isn't it? Sunnie's hard. [Fifi] Born from parents of an arranged marriage, Indian divorcee, Sunnie, is under cultural pressure when it comes to finding Mr. Right. [Sunnie] Divorce is not a normal thing in our culture. It's kind of a bit of a shame thing, so in terms of my family, letting them down was what was killing me but I definitely want to fall in love. I want to be head over heels. I don't want to get in an arranged marriage, I want the right one. [Fifi] But that right one hasn't been easy to find. - Where are you from? - From Sydney. I never get any attention. Maybe I'm not flirtatious enough. I feel like you're a tradie. - I am, yes. - Yeah, what do you do? - I'm a carpenter. - Yep, cool. [Fifi] Sunnie's a little confused about where she's going wrong. I honestly don't know. I don't know. I'm a farm girl. - Yeah? - But we don't have animals, we have veggies at the moment. We had orchards, grapes, - and stuff as well. - OK, yep, yep. So my parents are farmers. I'm born in New Zealand. I moved to Australia when I was seven to Melbourne. - I live in Melbourne now. - Yeah, OK. I am an accountant, my background. But I am an EA, which is an executive assistant. Feel the pace of it? You know how quickly, like, things... Yeah. It's quite staccato, too. Yes, exactly. - Life is really fast paced at work. - Yeah. - Hands on. - Yeah. A million miles an hour. Pace, pace, pace, pace. Just, like, ramp it up! And what else? What else can I know about you? What's your normal type? Um... There's no point wasting... [Matthew] It's amazing how much - impact of a date you control... - Mm. ...if you slow down and control your breathing. OK, so I am an accountant but I am an EA at the moment. So I am an assistant to the director of a real estate company. - OK. - So I am doing a bit of sales, a bit of HR, a bit of PR, a bit of social media, a bit of like random stuff. Are you a surfer because you're on the northern beaches? - Yeah. I am actually. - OK, yeah, yeah. But not so much anymore. I live in the city these days. - Yeah, yeah. - Um... If I'm listening... - Yeah. - Really listening to you, I don't go, "Yeah." - Yeah. - "Yeah." - Yeah. - "Yeah." "Yeah." I listen. Yeah. I sit here and I go... "Mmm." [laughs] All right, it was lovely to meet you, too. - Awesome. Lovely to meet you. - Thank you so much. - Thank you. - No worries. While Sunnie's on her own, I actually want to go and talk to her about this, - the pacing. - I think that's a great idea. I will be back. - How's it been so far? - OK. Because there's two things I noticed about you. What? OK. OK, tell me what they are. When somebody else is speaking, you're jumping in saying "OK." - OK. - "OK." - OK. - "OK." - Kind of like what I'm doing now? - Exactly! Isn't that good, 'cause I'm interested? But you can do it in a different way. - OK. - So... - Oh, I'm doing it! - Right. See what I'm saying? Right. OK, so what should I be doing? So if you're talking to me, I'm just gonna listen for a moment. - And nod. - Mm-hmm. OK. And now I say something and you really feel like I've listened. And even the fact that you're not saying "OK" right now is making you so much sexier. Really? That was hard for you just then, wasn't it? It was so hard! I could see your face because you're trying not to say it, but I promise you, when you do that, all of a sudden the person feels like you're actually listening. Then when you're talking, what I want you to do is slow everything down. - OK. - So that when you speak, it's like a different rhythm to it. - Right. - It's just breaking the habit. All right. Ready to go back out there? Yes. - Good luck. - Thank you. I'll see you in a bit. [Fifi] Keen to put Matthew's advice into action... I'm pretty active. I like to play touch football. [Fifi] ...Sunnie keeps a lid on it. See how she's not doing the "OK" thing anymore. [Fifi] Yes, she stopped it. [Matthew] Look how much sexier she looks, by the way, not doing that. Um, we used to live together. Oh, they're gonna get married, I can tell. [Fifi] Emma is also ready to put Matthew's dating tips to the test with her next date, 31-year-old Ryan. [Ryan] People call me "Knobsy" for a nickname, which is sort of short for my last name, Knobbs. I haven't really had a steady girlfriend for a couple of years but I'd like to find a nice, spontaneous, bubbly kind of girl so hopefully, she could be the future Mrs. Knobbs and hopefully we will crack on together. What are you looking for? Oh, just a girl who is just spontaneous, - cool... - Yeah! A kind of out there kind of girl... That can hold a conversation. - Ah, absolutely, yeah. - Boss you around. That kind of thing? Just what you are doing right here. Pretty much. [Fifi] Emma's advice from Matthew was to attempt forming a connection by stopping herself from asking question after question. [Emma] I think there was a connection with Ryan, I don't know why. The heart wants what the heart wants, you know? What do you do? I'm doing communications, international relations, and then I'm working casual as a lifeguard and a baker as well. So you're a lifeguard? So you could save me? I could have my life, you know... Easy. Consider it done. ...dream beach moment where the handsome lifeguard comes and saves me. [Fifi] There's such a difference. Getting her off the Q and A. - This is a whole different woman. - [Matthew] Yeah. Or you might just want to let me drown. - No. No way. - You might be like, "Ah, I'm sick of her!" [Matthew] I was saying this to Emma. There's a difference between talking and connecting. Well, I've done a couple of saves. It's the best feeling when you save someone. Them actually connecting now is creating much more energy. - It's nice to be a hero, isn't it? - Oh, yeah. It's not a real big hero... - No, you are hero. - It's a good deed. I'll take that. - Stop trying to be humble. - OK. [Sheridan] He's coming, isn't he? You're not gonna let me down. [Fifi] After rejecting every man she's dated so far... He's coming. I know he's coming. [Fifi] ...Sheridan is trying to believe the right guy is around the corner. [sing-songy] Kill me. - Hello! - [man] Hello. Hello, nice to meet you. Very nice to meet you. - I'm Sheridan. - Hello, Sheridan. Chad. Look at your eyes! I can't. Sheridan's interesting because when she wants to try, she actually comes across really well. [Sheridan] Aren't they incredible? - I'm not sure. - They're so blue. [Matthew] But there's an edge that comes out when she thinks the guy isn't right that actually comes across kind of mean. Accent? - Yeah, I'm from New York originally. - Yeah? Does she like him? [Sheridan] And what brought you here originally? Um, originally came playing water polo. Wow! I was a little bit worried about the hat that he may be bald underneath, but I could see lots of hair so I'm hoping that's a good sign. I used to play water polo all through school. State. - Did ya? OK. - Yeah, yeah, the whole way through. She likes him. She really likes Chad, Matthew. Do you still do a bit of sport now? Nup. None? I love that the one guy she's liked is called Chad. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. [Sheridan] You can tell he is quite fit. - [Chad] OK. - Yeah. He is taller. So he's quite attractive to me. Well, hopefully I'll see you later on at the mixer. Yeah, that's it. Very nice to meet you. It's really good. Thanks, Chad. I love your name, too. It's very American. - It is, isn't it, yeah? - Chad. I'm a big believer in serendipity. Yeah, I know a few Chads. Do you? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a cool name. So it may be a match made in heaven. OK, yeah. Well, Sheridan, - it was very nice to meet you. - It was very lovely to meet you. - I'll see you again. - I'll see you later on. Nice to meet you. Finally. Finally. Finally. Absolutely not against seeing her again. Uh, there's a mixer tonight. We got one. Certainly another conversation's required. [Fifi] With Sheridan sorted for now... Matt's decided to give Nikki some dating advice. - Hello. - Hello, hello. How are you? - Good, how are you? - I'm good. How's it going? [sighs] I think the hardest thing is just trying to make conversation with somebody so quickly. Trying to get to know what they're all about in, you know, eight minutes. Even if the guy opposite you isn't a great conversationalist, the only thing that matters is - what are they into and what are you into? - Yeah. Talk about things you care about. Like what are you into? I'm into MMA. I'm into mixed martial arts. - Really? - Yeah. - You do it yourself? - Yeah. My family has been into it all their life. Really? And, um, I've taken it up pretty recently, so, yeah, I'm very passionate about it. So, OK, check this out. That was a conversation. That was a conversation because you know how to make it a conversation. You're, like, you're normal. But you also gave me information about you. Ditch the small talk and then make it your mission to find out what they care about. - Oh... - All right. - Have fun with it. - Thank you! And practice. Even if you don't like the guy, just practice. Great advice. Absolutely great advice. - All right, go for it. - God, you're great. Thank you. So, I'm going to try that out and see how... see how it pans out for me. See if I do, uh, do him proud. Hopefully he's watching. I told her to talk about stuff she actually cares about. - Hello. - [man] Hello. - How are you? What was your name? - How are you doing? I'm Kiel. Kiel, lovely to meet you. I'm Nikki. Lady in red. How are you doing? Lady in red, yes. - Are you having a nice day? - You have got some muscles on you. Wow. What's going on there? - Um, well, yeah, I love to workout so... - Yeah. - I'm all about fitness, so... - That's awesome. Yeah, so, I do a bit of MMA. Do you, really? There it is. Do you like the boxing? The kickboxing? The jujitsu? Yeah, I think the Brazilian jujitsu side of things is my favorite. I think because you get to throw people around more than anything. Ooh! I think she likes him! And I think he likes her. Are you into MMA? Are you into fights? - Not really? - I like to do a bit of boxing. - A bit of boxing, yeah? - Um, basically anything - just to keep fit so yeah, so... - Yeah. I can tell. Those biceps. I can tell as well. Can you? Oh, yay! See how much warmer she is, like, giving energy. Well, if she sticks with him, they'll be engaged in three months. - They are perfect for each other. - They will be happy forever. I'm super excited about Nikki. Oh, yay! [Kiel] A few emotions going around in my head at the moment. Um... Well, look, it was lovely going on this date with you and, uh, look, I'd like to get to know you a bit more so... [Nikki] A bit nerve racking today but, um... I'm sure I'll see you in the future at some point. Yeah, definitely. Great to meet you, too, Kiel. - OK. - You take care. I'll see you soon. Hot. Like stupid hot. - Yeah? - You look gorgeous by the way. Oh, you're awesome. Thank you. So do you. Oh, yeah. He was the only guy that said I look beautiful. Like, out of the lot. You know why? Because he's hot, and he's nice and he's, yeah, he's just, yeah. Lady in red. [Fifi] After an intense day of dating... [laughter] [Emma] Come on, girls, embrace the experience. [Fifi] ...our ladies have one last challenge ahead. Girls, you did so well! I'm so proud of you. - Really? - [Fifi] Yes, you were amazing. How was it? - [Sunnie] Crazy. - Nerve racking. - Traumatic. - Absolutely. - It was full on. - Full on. Overwhelming. You're about to go on a mixer with these very same guys. Are we all together? You're all together. And you're gonna get a chance to meet everybody. This is like a club, for me, so this is my hunting ground. So I love that everyone is together. So here is what I am going to teach you tonight. You don't have to go and do the hunting but you could be approachable. One thing I saw today is like, "Ah, I don't like him, he's not my type," and in kind of an immediate dismissal. I don't want you to do that. If you can meet everybody, then you can meet anybody. Last thing... I want you to exchange numbers if you like someone. OK? Now if he doesn't ask, you can do it one easy way and that's just to say, "You seem really fun, we should catch up sometime." That's it. [Fifi] OK, so, girls, we're all set. Taken on all the advice. So remember to exchange numbers because tomorrow you are lining up a date with someone you connected with tonight. So you gotta get in there and make it count, OK? [Sunnie] I don't know how to pick up at a bar. This is really daunting. [Nikki] I have no idea how I am going to be. - So good luck! - Have fun. - Thanks, guys! - Thank you! Bye. I think the others may be a little intimidated by it, but the more the merrier. Hi, guys. [Fifi] Four ladies who've all been married before are on the hunt for a second chance at finding Mr. Right. Nice to see you. - I'm Matt. - Hi, Matt, lovely to meet you. Hello. CJ. [Fifi] And right now, they have one hour to work a room full of men... Nice to meet you. I am not going to remember this many names but lovely to meet you all. [Fifi] And exchange numbers with any guy they'd like to date tomorrow. - Adrian. What was your name? - [Mitch] Mitch. [Fifi] And once again, I'll be Matt's wing woman watching their every move. ...until we find potential husbands. So, Matthew, if you were walking into this room with all these guys, would you have a plan of attack if you were one of these girls? I mean, firstly, don't get stuck with people for too long. How old are you? Oh, you didn't reveal your age. Oh! Man, come on. So, it's good to have a conversation, build some rapport and then move on. - So I'm 41. - Sorry, say again? - Forty-one. I don't look it, I know. - You are hot for 41. Absolutely. It's because I don't eat inflammatory foods. [Matthew] Women have been taught that it is not their job to make the first move, so so many women hold back and I wish they wouldn't because they can make the first move. They can walk over to the guy. That's what I want them to do tonight. - Lovely to meet you. - How's it going, all right? Hey, Kiel. How are you? - How are you doing? - Good, how are you? Oh, here she goes. Nikki. [Fifi] Earlier today, Nikki had eyes for one man only. [Kiel] You having a nice day? You've got some muscles on you. Wow. What's going on there? Kiel is hot. Like stupid hot. [Fifi] And luckily for Nikki, Mr. Hot, Hot, Hot wants to cool down on the balcony. So they've taken themselves outside. This is good, Matthew. If I was to ask you now, favorite movie of all time? Super Troopers. [sighs] Oh, my God. We're so going to get along. [Fifi] She looks very interested. Yeah, yeah, she does. - [both] And the eye contact. - [Matthew] Yeah, the eye contact. Yeah, meeting people like yourself, like physically attracted to you and then actually having a connection with you in the first eight minutes. I didn't have that with anyone really. - Really? - Yeah. I would like to give you my number or do I take your number? Well, whatever you like. We can exchange numbers. I got his number, yay. Thank you. Lovely chatting. You, too. He's awesome. He's a really, really lovely guy. Down to earth and I am looking forward to actually properly going on a, on a date with him so, yay. Hi, I'm back. - Hey! - Hello! [Fifi] With Nikki bagging the first digits of the night... the competition steps up as Sunnie follows suit. It was really nice to meet you though before. - Yeah, it was. - Sweet! [Fifi] During her dates, she sparked interest from three different men. I love someone that's a communicator. [Fifi] Oh, Sunnie is getting a number. She's getting Matt's number. [Fifi] And Matt's move hasn't gone unnoticed by Sunnie's other admirers, Peter and Tom. Oh, you're good? OK. - Nice to meet you. See you, Sunnie. - See you later. - Take care. - [Peter] Tag. So that's Peter and he's wheeled his way over - to have a chat with her. - Not easily done. [Fifi] No! [Tim] Hey, you guys. Sorry to interrupt. [Fifi] Oh, look, now Tom's interrupted. Could I just have a chat to you afterwards? Sure I will come there. Don't worry. No worries. Sorry, mate. All good. All good. These guys are just swooping in. Do you want to do the number thing? Yeah, let's do that. To be honest with you, it's very rare a guy will come up to me. - Thanks, have a good night. See ya. - Thank you, man. [Fifi] Across the room, self-confessed cougar Sheridan, is on the prowl. For some reason, I attract the 20-somethings. So you're looking for a relationship then or... Yeah, yeah but not with someone that is 24. [Fifi] Earlier today, Sheridan proved hard to please. [Sheridan] Why am I being set up with all the short people? They're all coming up to my boobs. I should let you go. - I have a bit of a time limit. - Sure. Yeah. - Oh, do you? All right. - [Sheridan] Yeah! Yeah, no. I'm feeling bullshit at this time. [man] Hey, hey. It will be interesting to see whether Sheridan has a wake up moment during this whole process. I hope so. So now you're like my second husband because that is one of the reasons why we split. No, Sheridan is not going to have anyone from this mixer. [Matthew] I think she's going to struggle. Oh, you haven't met. So none of you have met and this is awkward now. No one really stood out to me as having any sort of enthusiasm. [Matthew] If she is not careful, tomorrow she'll be Billy no mates and the rest of them - will all have a date, yeah. - [Fifi] All these numbers. Did you meet any guys you kind of liked? [Emma] How are you? I'm Emma. Nice to meet you. Lovely to meet you. [Fifi] Four single wives getting back into the dating game have been set a mission by my right-hand man, love expert, Matthew Hussey. How do you want to play this? So... [Fifi] They need to exchange numbers with guys they like for a date tomorrow. This is me. This is my number. - Oh. OK. - I've saved it under me. [Fifi] And so far the girls have been proving that Matt's mission is not impossible. OK, let's see how Emma's going. And I was being very polite. [Fifi] Emma was divorced three years ago and being rusty in the dating game, is uneasy hosting some fierce male rivalry. Just pop over there and, uh, we'll chat later. No, it's OK, I can, we can all chat. Don't worry, boys, there is plenty to go around. It's all right. [Emma] They're confident. Like, they were just straight in, which I'm not used to. - What's happening inside? - Sorry, lads, let's go. - OK. I'm being taken. - [man 1] Give the boy a clap. - Oh, look at this guy. - Oh, look. [Fifi] He's taking her away on their own. - [man 1] Yeah, well, bro! - [man 2] Good, man. There was something about Chris. I felt really safe. - Chris. - I'm Emma. Lovely to meet you. [Fifi] Emma met Chris earlier. So what's your relationship history? [Fifi] But up until now, he hadn't made an impression. Um... So... I feel like there's more to know about you. There's a lot more to know about me. They look like a little potential couple there talking in the corner. I feel like you should maybe grab my number. I love every time you, like, you just jump ten steps. Locked and loaded. I want these girls to find their next husband. This has been really, really great catching up. - I'll text soon. - That'd be great. [Fifi] With the night drawing to a close, it looks like Sheridan has had a change of heart. Hello! Oh, Sheridan's on the move. Hello. [Fifi] She's tracked down American heartthrob, Chad. So I'd love to get your number if I can? - Sure. - Your face! The awkwardness of the whole thing is not lost on me. I dunno, I can't text you. - Why? - I don't have a mobile phone. - [man] He's off the grid. - I am a little bit... So my numbers to me are, like, a little different. It starts with a nine. I have never met an adult with no mobile phone. In fact, I haven't met anyone over 14 with no mobile phone. I can't believe you don't have a mobile. - Well, you can believe it. - [Sheridan] That's incredible. Really off the grid. You're like Bear Grylls. Yeah, kinda. I believe that Sheridan would want somebody who is generous and kind. - Nice to meet you. - And you. And I don't think she is showing enough of those things with men. We need to get in touch with what she likes about people again because it's too transactional. But there's something more under the surface with Sheridan. I think there is something going on that's making her quite guarded. [Fifi] After a big night, our ladies wake to their first day in their new home together and with dates to be organized, luckily, the messages are flowing in. And Nikki is pleased to discover that Kiel, the only man she had eyes for, feels the same way. Thank you. Lovely chatting. [Nikki] Oh, it was nice. It was a nice feeling to get a message from him so, um, yeah, we'll see what happens. "Hey, Sunnie, I just wanted to say hi and that it was awesome meeting you yesterday I had a nice time chatting." [Fifi] Sunnie's responding to Tom but after swapping numbers with two other guys, Peter... - So do you want to do the number thing? - Yeah, let's do that. [Fifi] ...and Matt... - OK. - Sorted. [Fifi] ...she's yet to decide who to date later today. Hmm. [Fifi] Meanwhile, Emma is also torn between men. She's been messaging knight in shining armor, Chris. - I'm being taken. - [man] Give the boy a clap. [Fifi] And larger than life, Knobsy. - Can I get your number? - Yeah. What are you going to write it on? - Your hand? - My hand. No, that is definitely her number. Something different. Old school. [Fifi] But for twice-divorced Sheridan, last night's events proved fruitless. [Sheridan] I haven't got any messages this morning and I'm OK with that because I would have cut them off anyway. There was no chemistry. There was no electricity. There was no rip your clothes off. There was nothing with anyone and that's what I need with my personality or it's just never going to happen. [Fifi] Having been married twice before, she's no stranger to the feeling of falling in love. [Sheridan] I was absolutely besotted with my ex-husband. I thought he walked on water. It never entered my mind that it wasn't going to last. [Fifi] After what he witnessed yesterday, Matthew suspects that Sheridan is still harboring the past. I want to get time with her to get to understand her better because there's a lot going on there. Hello. Hello, how are you? I'm good. What I've seen in Sheridan so far is someone who's put up a lot of walls and whatever has happened to Sheridan is responsible for some of the behaviors that I am seeing right now. Well, I'm glad we get some time to ourself. Mm? I've noticed vulnerability is a challenge for you. Yes. Very much so. Getting vulnerable is a challenge. And what I would love to understand is more about where that comes from for you. For me, it's more... So stepping into the ring with dating, no problems. It's further down the track that the... push starts. Sorry. It's OK. And I know I do it. [sighs] And I know I have to stop doing it. But I don't think it's always been there. When you say you don't think it's always been there, you think it started when? Probably six weeks into my second marriage. Mm-hmm. When my self-esteem was destroyed. [sobs] What happened six weeks in? [Matthew] Today I am going to ask Sheridan about her past. I want to understand her marriage and the consequences of that for her emotionally. 'Cause it's gonna tell me so much about why she is where she is today. Probably six weeks into my second marriage, my self-esteem was destroyed. [sobs] What happened six weeks in? I found things that were going on, but behind my back. But, um, what it did to me... I looked at myself and thought I wasn't good enough... and that if I was good enough, he wouldn't have done it. Yeah. And then it just kept going. I kept finding out more and more things as time went on. And I kept digging because I couldn't stop myself and I should have. [sniffles] But it's still very hard because I think as a female, we're very hard on ourselves. And we tend to blame ourselves for everything that goes wrong. And I adored him. There was nothing I wouldn't have done for him. I didn't want it to end. Yeah. And I would have ignored everything. This person is supposed to safe guard the most precious thing you have between each other, which is your trust. Yeah. And when someone breaks that bond, it rocks the core. I don't think I've ever recovered from that. Right. So as soon as I get close to someone, I then think they're going to do it to me again, so I start to... to push and I know I do. - Yeah. - But it's just that ingrained, I may as well end it now because they'll end it eventually once they see the real me and they'll go for someone else behind my back again. Yeah. This is the you I was expecting to meet, by the way. Hello. The sad, crying one? No, no, the real one. The vulnerable one. Not the you that is talking about how these... these people are all too short or this person is not... You know, got enough money, or this or that. Like I am watching you judge people left, right and center at the same time as being terrified of being judged. But it's a defense, right? So you deciding what this is going to mean now will shape the rest of your life. And ultimately, the person who is worthy of you, they will only find you if you give your all. So you giving your all is the beacon that shows the best men where you are. So, as you go forward now and my mission to you is just to decide for yourself, OK, let's create a symbol of you moving on. It's your way of saying, "I'm done." Yeah. I'm done. Life's too short. I'm done. Can you think of anything that is a symbol of you saying, "Enough is enough? I'm moving on?" [Fifi] Next time, it's first dates for our single wives. Hi! This would have to be the best first date you've ever been on. [Fifi] But when put under the microscope... [Matthew] We're going to go through these dates and break them down. Oh, no. [Fifi] ...emotions run high. The truth is you don't know me. It's freaking me out. [screaming] [Fifi] Then an evening lesson on how to pick up... - [Emma] Hello. - [Sheridan] Hello, boys. [Fifi] ...takes a shocking turn. [Sheridan] What? [Fifi] ...with the arrival of an unexpected guest. Seven billion people on this planet and you have to date the friend of your ex.
