Stand by! Enjoy the party, it's 1906. And... action! Step back, please. It's over there. Cut! Come on, one more... "Una más! That's Spanish for number one. Quicker on the sticks for this one. Why do you want me to generalize? Now I'm content. In five minutes, I'll be furious. and in ten minutes I'm content again. It changes like that. You know that. Tell me one more thing, you're gonna be shooting a new scene tonight... -Yeah. -What are the main ideas of the scene? One main idea. Just to shoot it. Just to shoot it... Just to finish... It's in the script. What matters... It's not an important scene. It's not a very important scene... it shows... shows a world into which Evelyn Nesbit enters after Harry K. Thaw has been sentenced to a mental asylum. She is surrounded by sleazy agents and managers. They are dragging her into a different world. Away from the younger brother. I want to know the meaning. The inner meaning. Essence? Charm... Charm, music, the girl... That's not the inner meaning. That’s not the meaning... the inner... that cannot escape from this shot... - Is it exclusively the story? - Yes Yes. I think so. That way it’s impossible... you’re not a story director, - But why... - You're an auteur director... Why didn't you say so before the shooting! I could have improved it. Now it's too late. Now I have to film what's in the script. This is the worst time to talk theoretically. Absolutely worst time to speak theoretically. It’s always the same! We speak later... Surely you know what your intention is. No, not during the shooting. All you are concentrating on... But you must know what you want. You always have to be aware of what is important and what is not. Or you'd lose consciousness of continuity. Consciousness of continuities. Because at the outset, it is necessary to be conscious of the continuities, whether they are negative or positive. It is necessary to take account of parallel actions. and to be aware of tradition. These things provide an overall view. embracing a wide horizon. Play! Play! Play! Cut! Something's strange. We start with you hitting the strings. You come here, you say "Play!" and you stay there. Here. You stay there. When they are playing, very slowly, you turn around and move forward. OK? After completing his studies in Prague in the 1960s, Milos Forman became the major representative of the Czechoslovak New Wave. with films like The Ace of Spades, Loves of a Blonde, and Fireman's Ball. The success of his films catapulted him into the arms of Carlo Ponti. But the stronghold quickly loosened when it became evident that Milos's mind could be neither kneeded or crushed. His strong will did not even break when he encountered foreign toughness. One more. Ready! Milos, I have to call my waiters before you yell background for Mike. Stand by! Talking. And... the first waiter. Mike. Play! Play! Play! You couldn't hear him? That took him three times to yell "Play!". Once you hear play, you turn around and react. Mike, go again. Get ready! There was only a slight crack in him that allowed him to understand the surrounding world around him that much more quickly. Quiet please! Quiet! You guys are enjoying the conversation, the band members. You are looking and talking. The first waiter enters! Michael. Play! Play! Play! Once again. No, you have to stop... at this very spot, right here. You have to stop... Can't go so far, right? Once again. OK, back it up. Who is Milos Forman, in fact? Czech or American? Czech-American? Or American-Czech? First waiter! Is it possible to uproot someone? What sources inspire his work? Play! Life is surrounded by death... Youth, love, and everything else is etched on a surface of failure. It is perhaps the initial source of our inspiration. Do you have dreams, Milos? I have only two subjects of daydreaming I guess. When you try to fall asleep, you want your mind to to be in a happy mood You dream about women and... of what... you're doing right now. In the sense that you are doing it well. What influences you? Everything... Everything. The whole thing. But what it was exactly, I don't know really. How can you say what has had the strongest influence on yourself and your life? I think the strongest influence, is the genes that we bring to this planet. Our mother and father give you your strongest influence in the genes. Hasn't the greatest milestone been having been orphaned after your parents died? What do I know? That's how I feel. I can't... I think it was important when I found myself... being by myself at the age of whatever, 10. I have to deal with situations at an age when you are very perceptive to learn... Where we are very open to every new experience. I had to deal with things that normally you face later on. I don't know... Have you had any influences, ideals, desires... Something that shocked you, a person who is dear to you? A director, for instance? I believe that the influence of art, in general... on a young person who's just out of puberty, in these very fragile years, I think is enormous. It can put you... on a path... It's not necessarily great art... which does it to you... It was a book, which I never heard of again, "Plavčíci kapitána Bontekoea" which made me discover a world of fantasy. I just loved it. I couldn't wait to run home to live in the world of this book. I was very sad, when it was over. I was begging God to make me forget the book so I could read it again with the same discoveries as if I didn't know anything. Then later, I must say, it's very strange, I discovered with great excitement the lectures of Dr František Dvořák, who taught art history. He was talking about paintings and... why... and what distinguished the Italian renaissance school from the Flemish... It was... I spent hours going through galleries and art books on my own just being excited by this teacher. Who has influenced you most in cinema? I guess it was Charlie Chaplin. I was so impressed by his power over me. Because I would come in a theatre, in a cinema, and all of a sudden, here I am, laughing or crying, exactly as he is dictating. This power over me fascinated me. I wanted to exercise the same power over people, sitting in the movie house. Any time, I was laughing so hard so much that I couldn't see anything I was crying with laughter. How did he do it? How does Milos Forman captivate moviegoers? Let's just shoot the beginning. Then continue just as written. Then we'll film these two. This one, this one and this one. What do we have to do to make them talk? They know what we want. Why don't we just to get that Conklin? I know where he lives. It keeps us in people's minds... While they are here, let's move them around a bit. They will be in front and we can see them all. Mara will be here and we will have to change everything. In that case, I'll have to rewrite it. Just for these two shots. Can you show me the beginning. Open it in front of your face. Do exactly as I did it. In front of your face. And turn the page. Nothing in here. You got anything? Who's next? Do you have anything? Guess who it is. It says here that the bombs, if it's related, were planted by a deranged man. Who is a bad actor for you? A bad actor... A bad actor, is the one you don't believe. But that doesn't mean they're bad. They're just not persuasive. Might not be their fault. Just get him. Let's do that. I'm not finished yet. I know where he lives. Yeah, why don't we do that? All three of you should... Yes, why don't we do that? Once you shoot, you don't care... what's wrong. Show me again the beginning. Let's do the whole thing again just before he closes the newspaper. I just want to... Nothing here. You got anything? No, nothing. Wait a minute. Says here that the bombings, if it's related, were the work of deranged madmen. They don't take us seriously. What have we got to do before they are willing to talk? They know what we want. Why don't we don't just... go get Conklin, just get him? I see thousands and thousands of actors. Even for tiny, little parts, I do readings. I can't take a chance that an actor will be bad, not because he's a bad actor, but because he is wrongly cast by me, which is very possible. I've seen so many wonderful actors act badly because of they were wrongly cast. I don't know what it is. Why you can be wonderful in a part and bad in another. Why some can be good all the time or some just once in a lifetime. Acting is a total mystery to me. Something I admire enormously. It's wonderful that somebody is able to do this to me. And I am very angry when somebody can't do it to me. Someone who is pretentious or too mechanical or you see through it. I get angry because... I feel betrayed. I'm here, I want to believe your story and all I see, is some kind of bravura, some kind of mechanics, and I get angry. What other kinds of experience did you with other directors before? There were nothing like what I do with Milos, especially film. Doing film with Milos, it was... it's still, because we still have one day to go, something I know I won't have too many more times. I don't think I'll get a chance to meet another director like Milos because he has... a tremendous sense of what is universal. He understands the whole human idea. ...the total idea of humanity, he understands it all He gives me confidence... ...that I'll never forget. I can't forget it. Other directors will tell you: do this and do that. But he just: Wait, no, no, no. So, you stand there and you say: "Damn... what should I do?" They don't give you any idea. "What are we doing? What's it about?" I don't know. I don't know. So we're discovering it together. Making... discoveries. But it's necessary... How do you say it? For the ship to have a captain. There's always a captain. and the others are the ones who work. Needless to say, there is a direction. Here at the Chelsea Hotel right now I am here out of pure nostalgia, because I was staying here when I came for my first time on a private visit to the United States. Then I lived here for two years, when I didn't have any money. I feel sentimental about the fact that for a year I didn't pay my rent and nobody said a word. These things make you feel something very personal about the hotel. My first Christmas... away from home, away from my country, I spent it here, in practically the same room. I was absolutely alone... and I playing with the television set. And suddenly, I think it was on Channel 9 or Channel 11, I found out that they were showing a burning fireplace, nothing else. I was lying in the bed, I had a bottle of champagne, and a little caviar, and I was watching for hours a fireplace on the television. And I was feeling so sorry for myself, I was so sad. I loved it. Happiness doesn't exist. Happiness is too abstract. I so much look forward to something that will make me happy and the moment I have it, I'm disappointed. The way I got it gave me much more excitement, much more happiness than the goal when you get there. I guess for me, to be free to pursue your happiness is the ultimate happiness. For you, happiness is not peace. Happiness... is the road to happiness. Tranquility... is wonderful for resting. You can't keep moving and running all the time. You need calm, you need to stop. But that's good to rest. But everybody wants to be tranquil, at peace. Because everybody needs to rest. Because everybody... needs to rest. So you're saying that, the peace everyone is searching for is also a search for death? It could be death. No, that doesn't mean it's... It doesn't mean death. It just means you're resting. You're gathering strength, gathering power, gathering thoughts. You're getting ready for a new trip. Can you tell me who you are? I am consciously avoiding analyzing myself. Because I have a horror... not to become one of these self-indulgent self-inverted people who constantly analyzes and talks about himself. It is not really important if you are like that or not. We have been raised to think and question who we are. We were taught it even while in school. I know that when I came to school, and I was studying I was so much overwhelmed by everything I saw, all these films, paintings and literature. My natural tendency was to copy. I was stealing everywhere because I wanted to be like that. I wanted to be like that filmmaker, I wanted to be like that filmmaker... I wanted to be like that writer. Slowly, you find out... that it's good that it will provoke or inspire you... but in the end, you end up... as somebody who is doing a bad imitation of someone else's work. The only way, is to try to find what you want to say, what you want to express. How you feel. Even if you are taking the risk that it will be bad, it will be boring, and that it will not interest anybody, you have to try that. So, what did you learn? Vera, I... I don't know what I learned about myself. I learned about myself that I enjoy what I do, that I enjoy telling stories. But what it means, in what you are doing, I don't know. I need to know if you know what you want. What is your position on life, on living? I don't know. I think that these questions, are like masturbation in cold water. Of course I know what I want... I want... You can say: I know it or I don't know it. I'll tell you, I know that I have nothing to do and I would love to make a movie. All I want is to find a book, a script. And I am reading and reading... until one day I find I find a story and I am excited, I can't stop reading that book. I want to do that book. Why? Because I was not bored. That's the only reason. I want to do this film... Why don't you want to know the reason you want this or that particular book? I don't care. I don't... You have a thinking brain, don’t you? One should always ask why! Everybody wants to know... But of course. "Ragtime", when I read "Ragtime", It's a wonderful story which is about something which I... I like to talk about, it's about man's pride. It's about man's... fight for dignity, for something which we all... These are the premises! But on the other hand, you have the same ideas in another work which is totally boring. It's not the idea which count, it's a combination of idea and its execution. That's what's important. It's not the idea itself, not the execution itself. You can have a brilliant book, and you finish reading and you say: "So what?" On the other hand, you can have a wonderful idea... and it's so boring how it is written and how it is told. Then who cares? It's always a combination. How can you connect with things, if you don't want to analyze anything, if you don't want to know yourself? I think that the knowledge about myself, which I get without wanting it, is enough to depress me, you know. So, why should I even work on this kind of self-destruction? Well... at least you’d know the truth. I thought you were looking for it. Alright, are we ready? We can start moving a little earlier. Here we go. Stand by! Full of vim, full of vigour. Background action first. Stand by, background action. Michael! Quickly, play! Play! Forward, forward! Evelyn, look at that! Stop, stop now. Hold it. Same positions. You should stop, touch... Underneath this... Under the chandelier. All of you. And you all, come forward. Don't be shy! Come on in! You are all looking at the statue. Applauding, applauding, admiring... Being happy... Now, Tommy... We're pulling back with this guy. He will take us over there. From that moment, you see all these people running, you slowly pan and start to follow... The only thing we will have to fix is... You'll see what will happen... They should be coming down a little early, Evelyn and her entourage. So as these people cross over... they gotta be at the door, instead of the steps... too far back... Now you have to go down faster and faster. You push the people who are in your way. Until they move. Push them! And how about the guys that are coming in with them? Do you want them to take a picture? One up there and one in here? Huh? A couple of guys are coming down with them. One guy stops here and the other one here. Do you want them to do it like this? Yeah, it can be. Yeah, it can be right now... That's alright. Now... What do we do about the music? We might have some stuff underneath it. No, we'll do it without music. We only record the sound. Yeah. Now, Mike... Mike... we will only play the music in the rehearsal now. We will not play the music. You'll have to cue them. One more rehearsal. Let me see one. First positions. Silencio! Let's go. Everybody quiet! That's a live sale over there, I want walking, talking, drinking. Well, it seems to me that the most important thing is to serve the idea, the story with the adequate filmic way. Which means, I don't think there exists one formula for the specificities of film language. I don't think it exists. Every story dictates a different way how to express it how to tell it. Well... there are a number of specific filmic means... Name some of them. There is no theoretical answer to this question because every scene, every story, every... mood in the film, asks for its own specific expression. But cinema is an audiovisual system. What do you think is the most... let's say... which way suits you best? Tell me. There are so many possibilities. Sensitive material, in colour, good stereo music, a good editor... What does auteur cinema mean then? Author cinema is... a normal cinema where a director is involved from the beginning to the end. That's author's cinema, regardless if you want it or not. Even if you are doing the most conventional commercial, whatever, type of films. Once you are involved as a director, from the beginning, of the writing of the script to the final stages of editing and mix, it's an author film. What is it to 'think through film'? One doesn't think through film. Why not? It's entirely up to you how you make use of the language of film to express your attitude about a thing. That is happening every time, even if you are doing the most conventional movie. I don't think that's... I think that's the normal process. Whatever you are saying, whatever story you are telling, you have... basically some kind of emotional relation to that story. And these emotions will come across, must come across, regardless... if you want it or not. But you adapt somebody else's material. Does that mean you identify with it? Look. Every... material is foreign. We are not born with these ideas. Our ideas are based on what we have lived, what we have read, what we saw on the screen or in the theatre... what we heard. It all comes from the outside to our... little thing. They are all foreign. I don't make distinguish my material and foreign materials. It is all foreign and it is all mine, the moment I decide to deal with the material. So, by accepting someone's material you're expressing yourself. Because you know... I found out that I can't function as a writer in a country and in a language where I didn't spend my childhood and teenage years. I can't do it. I don't feel safe enough. I have to rely on on material written by people who digested the experience of childhood in this country. But... it would be a bad service to any of these books or plays if I just illustrated them. I have to treat this material as they treat their original material. Regardless of whether it is their own experience or something else. For example, "Ragtime". "Ragtime" is basically based on historical facts that E. L. Doctorow read about or heard about. It is also based on, or inspired by a novel by Heinrich von Kleist, "Michael Kohlhaas". But he took this material and made his own vision from it. Here I have "Ragtime", his book, and his version became for me a material for my own vision. What is the difference between his conception of it and yours? There is no difference I'm trying to stay faithful to the spirit of the book. The concept of the book, it is literature. You can't... This is a film. Are you trying to experiment? If I experiment? In what sense? Experiment in the sense of searching, in the sense of probing. Do you feel the need to say things again in a different, inimitable way? In your very own, unique voice? What makes you decide to delve into a risky project with an uncertain outcome? A topic you're not sure if you can to master. Do you understand what I'm saying? You never have any certainties. You always experiment. Of course, you don't want to repeat what you saw yesterday on TV or in a film. Of course, you have the ambition to find another way. It's not a question of being original at all costs. Not at all. No, not at any price... If I did certain things or I saw certain things, which I love and I like them, I'll do them again and again. But when I'm not happy with what I'm planning, what I'm thinking about, then I try to find another way. That won't be so boring... dull, as what I've seen or done before. Then you try to look for new ways and possibilities. But it's not a question of speculation. Yes, I know that, but as filmmakers we are trying to find a way that's not boring. Once I've said something, it's boring. Not necessary. There are things you know... which you like and excite you again and again. Background. Hello, hello! Background. And... Mike! Quickly, play, play! That's my girl over there! Look at that! Here, you are here. Suddenly, she's moving here. So the best spot to photograph her is here. Every photographer wants to be here. But the scribes go in... If we get back here, but the scribes are coming in... No, the scribes shouldn't come in, these are your photographers and you want them to have pictures for your newspaper articles. You will not get them if you just stand like this. Opposite is good. You are trying to make it clear they should be photographed. You should be in there taking your photographs... And you, be much more aggressive. You have to clear it. You get in there and start saying... Place your leg like the statue. This hand, this hand. Look, look! You check if you are like the statue. Go on your toe. Yeah! There you go, good, now stay! Here I want to see some movement. And we are trying to get the best frame, right? The inspiration for "Ragtime", was the house I lived in, which was built in that period, in 1906. I was staring at the wall one day, wondering what I was going to write. I started to write about the wall, then the house. And what things must have been like when the house was built. As the author of the book from which he is making a film, from which the film is derived from, it was in my interest in seeing to it that... the film has some fidelity to the ideas and the spirit of the book. And Milos... has his own independence, as an artist, to think about. And he would rather not have... - I'm pretty sure - my point of view, my proprietary point of view to deal with. He has said to me: "Why don't you grant me as filmmaker the same freedom to deal with your book as a source that you grant yourself when you write the book in the first place?" My answer to that is that I grant you all the freedom you want, Just don't call it "Ragtime". It's not just a question of of what's already in your head and what you can on paper. But also how you are able to provoke each other and inspire each other. I remember when I was ready to start "Hair", the movie, Michael came and I asked him if I had read "Hair", if I knew the music and the play. He said yes. "So what do you think? "How do you think this movie should be done?" His answer was "I have no fucking idea." At that moment, I understood that this is a good starting point, we can start from there. That's great. Then we sit down and say, "All right. "So, now... "who opens the door and what does he or she say?" So you bonded over sharing doubts. It's like anything. Something unites people, that we try to explain afterwards. And it's pointless. You either enjoy being with somebody or you don't. We don't know why, You can't explain it. It's just that way. And it's a lot of fun. I think there is one thing that's important that... we share, a certain kind of, emotional attitude towards situations and people. It's important to find out. It's something that you really have to find out. It's not that you can tell him: "Do it like this or do it like that." And "Feel this way". You either feel that way or not. What I mean is, you have to get to find out if this character we both like emotionally, we feel compassion for the same people, hatred for the same people, we feel... am I right? Yeah, yeah. It would probably be difficult to collaborate if this character has all my compassion and love and he loathed him. If he thinks that I... I think that's probably... Except sometimes I know, I'm sure that it's very good that Sometimes the material that you want to work on or that I like, you won't think much of it, or I won't think much of it, and you have to justify it... It's sometimes good that we have to challenge each other before we really know for sure that we do feel good in it. There are often times when that we each have our own idea. I'll tell you one thing that's Really important. You have to have... the confidence and trust to make terrible mistakes and to be wrong. That is very critical in a collaboration. If you know you can be stupid in front of a person and say anything when you're in trouble for an idea, without having to defend it and look intelligent, you can just be stupid, that's very important. There must be ideological goals that you identify with. What did you find interesting in "Ragtime"? From this point of view, she is interested in what interested you in "Ragtime". Well first of all, I must be very superficial, I don't become interested in something for ethical... I'm not interested in working on a story for ethical reasons. If it's an unethical story, I don't like it. But that's rare. What usually attracts me in the end, it's not some deep ethical... I'm not a moral writer. These things don't excite me, the moral truth in something. At least, not in the first instance. Maybe when you start working on it, it begin to excite me a little more. But in "Ragtime", I liked the period it was set in. I liked something about all the different stories it was trying to tell in different ways. It was almost... For film, if the material brings you plot, or something to build a good plot and good characters. For me, that was what was very attractive in "Ragtime", the book. Because... it's not... It's so intriguing to be able to build a plot and characters. It was so... You open a conflict here and suddenly it becomes a different conflict. Then you open... a character. And you lead one character to meet another one. Then the 3rd character takes you away. And still, how to feel the same kind of tension and suspense for that character, without feeling betrayed that another character dropped out of the story. That kind of thing makes you... So, if you mean... if there was something in the way he wrote his sentences... For instance, Doctorow is a very conscious writer, he knows exactly what he's doing. And he found a kind of prose to write the book with, It's not the prose he has written his other books with. It's specific to this one. It's a set of of short "jazzy" sentences. He was thinking about ragtime music, he tried to find equivalent prose. If you are saying, "Do I as a writer, "try to find a way to make a film that reflects the ragtime feeling of the sentences?, Then no, I don't know how to do that. It may have been something that interested Doctorow in finding sentences. But it's not one of the things that would excite me much in finding out how to turn it into a screenplay. I'll tell you... it was dictated by the book. I wanted, consciously, for the film to have the same flavour, a very free way to tell stories which interlock, in which the characters are coming out of nowhere and disappearing into nowhere and yet you feel they are essential and important for something which was either before or which is coming later So that nothing is arbitrary, everything makes sense at the end of the film. And still you have the feeling of having seen a saga, a mosaic, not just one situation-story So I had this in mind. It's not that... You see, I like that kind of story for films. I don't know if... This was something I tried unsuccessfully in "Fireman's Ball" Which doesn't have a central character at all. "Ragtime" still finally, about halfway through the film, suddenly one or two characters emerge as the leading characters. Which "Fireman's Ball" doesn't have at all. It was a failure but it's something I like, I like very much, Because it's... as unpredictable and full of contradictions as life itself. But, what do you do in order not to simply illustrate the book? You don't have a formula! You don't have a formula for how to attack this problem. If you had a formula, it wouldn't be difficult make wonderful films out of any book. That's not true. Creative intent doesn't equal success. You are right. It doesn't mean that that if you have a formula that it'll be successful in the end. That's true I think it's dangerous to have any formula at all, because then you are really... doing something in cold blood because a formula is something, it's almost mathematical. Then you decide, alright, we'll decide to attack it with this or that formula then it is lifeless what you are doing. It would be fulfilling some kind... You always work intuitively? No, it's never like that. You start with intuition, but the moment you write down your first sentence, you're already setting up rules for yourself. If you write this sentence, the next one can't be any other sentence but this one. The moment you start working, you are setting rules and formulas for yourself. It's always a symbiosis, or... Of course it's always a symbiosis. but you can only get as much out of it as you invest into it. Surely you don't destroy something simply by knowing more about it. Look, let me give you an example of what I am talking about. I was aware... that I have, because... After a while, when you tell stories with certain characters, you can't suddenly stop to show what's everything that's around. I was aware that, if I had a place, a space, a film space, to show a certain kind of period, and places, and people, and different places, and different people, and give the flavour of the whole, this is right at the beginning of the film. How to do it? We open the film with newsreels to which Coalhouse Walker, in the moviehouse, playing, accompanying on the piano. One of the last newsreels will take us into the real story because it deals with the unveiling of the nude statue which was a big scandal in the period nineteen-something in New York, when it was on public display very high above the city but still, but it was still a nude woman. Look, I'm asking you about the mechanics of directing, not the dramaturgy. How can you... how can you work... to get underneath the surface? To reveal the sense of things. And not only their surface. How do I know? I am trying! I'm trying. I only know that the first important thing how to get things across is to cast well. Cast people that the audience will believe that they are these people To cast actors who are alive enough their face, their eyes... That they can express things so that you can see what is happening behind their eyes, behind their flesh itself, behind their skin. If you have that, then you know that you have to cover it in a certain way, so that you give the actor the chance to give you as much... observation of their behaviour, faces, so that, when you put it together in a certain way it comes across, what's behind it. It's not just... learned dialogues where only the words make sense, but also the faces, the behaviour, the mood, the light... You have to believe in yourself, believe in the people you work with, and you choose, of course. And you have to believe that you're taking a risk. There is no guarantee. Do you know what the final form will be yet? I am superstitious. And I don't want to talk about the film until it's finished. I'm just superstitious. You're not sure of the outcome? I'm never sure of the result. I'm not sure about it now, and I never will be sure about it. I can't judge it, I can't see it. You've got some rice on your chin. But that's a professional question, the most important one. To know the initial premise and what it will become... at the end. It’s about the process of... How do you say “grasp”? - "Grasp"? - The process... To grab hold of it. To own the idea. I'm too stupid to talk about this. No, it's true. You must be a narcissist. But why? When you discuss film as such, or the meaning of things... We must talk about the meaning of things. Listen, if I tell you, "Yes, this story which attracted me "because it deals with men's pride and the desire for tolerance", what does that mean? I just want to know the difference between the first idea and the outcome. Rather than discussing ideas, go see the film, they're there. If I wanted to discuss it, I wouldn't make a movie about it. What? Why would I talk simply about the plot? Just watch it and you'll find out. But I'm making a movie about you, and would like to know what were you you were looking for in the beginning. I want to know what you want, who you are. And if you behave like that, that’s the only thing I’ll have. I'm in the worst person to tell you who I am. If you say 'I refuse', that says something about you, too. I'm so much scared to sound so intelligent, and smart and pretentious. What if the movie is a piece of shit? This little piggy goes to market. This little piggy is going home. This little piggy has roast beef. And this piggy goes wee-wee-wee all the way to the bank! - That's it. - That's it. All the way to the bank, that's what he does. That was very good. But you need to push it more. You have to start out laughing. When you say, "this one... and this one... "and blah, blah, blah", you start laughing. "This little piggy..." It must be full of life. Yes, you're right. I like it... when a director leads me through very contradictory emotions that I will attribute to life on the screen, not to the director. The moment I see the director talking to me, I am out. I lose emotions. I don't feel any emotional contact with the screen. Do you lose emotion even when you read? Reading a book, is literature, we know that someone... it's a stream of subjective thoughts, that someone is telling you. But a film, because of the nature of photography, it's objective. Of course it is. It forces you to see something. Yes, but that's the game that I love, when it's hidden. When I don't see it. Because what appears on the screen, on the photograph, everything is real. The trees, they are real trees. Yes, but what about the editing? That's what I'm saying. ...after editing, you have broken it, deformed it. I know. But I like it best when a filmmaker does it to me without me being aware it. I like the impact of the game he plays with me. But I don't like to see through it. Yes, I know it, it’s your love... things with the story... You're in agreement with the audience on that, they like stories, too. But the viewer is not your your only criterion. Your goals must be higher. than the wishes of the viewers. But I am a partner. I don't want it to be like a student at school listening preaching... I don't like that. ...when someone wants to know something, it means he is a student? Of course. Then I'll go to school. So, everyone should keep on learning till the end of times, huh? First of all, it's good that the character is the guy who goes for the first time. I'll make him act like he's a pro. Well, it depends.. It's up to you. Milos Forman shares his experiences at Columbia University another harvest is germinating in Czechoslovakia. Let's hope his offspring. will not linger in the shadow of their father. If you want to do a funny observation of human behaviour, I think this is the right basis. You’re often criticised due to your humour being based on ridicule. That's a very relative question, when you laugh with someone, you're laughing at... You know... I don't make... I don't make those kinds of distinctions. You can't really laugh at anybody you like You always laugh with him, even if you make him look ridiculous. I would never joke with someone with someone I don't like. I would never joke at the expense of someone... I don't like. I can really laugh only at the expense of people I like. I can... I can stand better than anyone else, if they like me, that they tell me what they want. And it's true. I can't stand it if I know that this person dislikes me. That's petty, I guess. I should be able to stand that, I suppose. I just about understand you. One of the most important laws of nature is balance. And that is very often mistaken. Because... when things lean to one side, and they're in danger of falling, you have to push in the other direction. While it's unpopular because the whole trend is to go the other way. You might be considered a rebel, or as an opponent, you know, to the established system or the established trend. That's bullshit. It's not true. You're doing a good service because you're trying to maintain the balance. You know what I'm talking about? I know what you mean. Engagement doesn't always get a warm reception, even if it's compassion for reality. When you think about it, you don't feel compassion with institutions. You feel compassion with individuals. Compassion... I don't have compassion for institutions. I have compassion for individuals. So, it's a person who deserves our compassion. If an individual of individual lives, happiness, well-being, are threatened by another individual, that is a good conflict and I'm not saying that it's worth it to talk about that but it's a much more touching conflict if it's between an individual and an institution. Regardless, if it it's society in general or the school, the office, the government, whatever... There, when a person gets into a conflict with an institution, there I feel I feel a very strong compassion. Because I know that this individual needs my compassion. And the compassion of all of us because through this compassion, we protect ourselves. I think this is that's the major conflict in human existence. For we are individuals and all, we struggle for our independence and our freedom as individuals. On the other hand, we need institutions to be able to live. So, we create institutions but every institution, by its nature, after a while, starts to dominate us, to own us. And in that moment, starts the most dramatic conflict, I guess... since the beginning of mankind and it will last forever. I guess this is what you call... the social meaning of what we are doing. That's your answer as to why you make movies? All I can say is, is that I'm trying to do things my own way. Which I admire, which excited me, and inspires me and provoke me, as a student, as a spectator, until today, done by other people. Which... I am fascinated by the contradictions of life. I am fascinated by the ambiguity of things. Where, next to each other live tenderness and cruelty, sadness and joy, wisdom and silliness, It fascinates me... than in one person, one story, one time, these things are there, if you look from a certain angle. It's silly, it's cruel. It's materialistic, it's dry. And if you look at the same thing from another angle, it becomes tender, poetic. It's very wise. And it's beautiful. And because I can never figure it out myself how these things happen, That keeps me talking about them. Each of us has been placed before a different task. And each of us sees our mission from a different angle. We are different from each other in our beliefs, our interests and in our opinions. But there is no difference that can make us forget our common and fundamental desire, our thirst for evolution and liberty. I don't need a happy ending, but I need a catharsis. I need to feel that tragedy is not in vain. Because I believe in it. I believe that even if I never find the meaning of life, or that it has some meaning And I don't care if I find the meaning or not. I just want to believe it does. That's all. I know that we are not immortal. But I just don't want to live with the idea that I am going to die at any moment and that nothing make sense. I love it here. This pair... comes every year. Last year they had 11 little ones, The year before that, they only had 6. It's incredible because they arrived about three weeks ago. They're... walking around, flying. And then they'll disappear. And one day they will come back with the little ones behind them. And if you try to find out where they are hatching, nobody knows. Nobody can find out. That's why I had to put this thing there, in the middle of the water so that the little ones can sleep on the wood thing in the water. Otherwise, they wouldn't stay here. They have to be protected in the night from the fox. You know? I saw several times, all the family the geese family, sitting there, on that wooden box, with the fox walking around here. Watching each other. The role of art, is to express meaning, rhythm, And the terrible beauty of life. The awakening of sympathies and of human solidarity. For it is these qualities, hand in hand, that fend off all that is lowly, egotistical and condemnable. Subs by mammame
