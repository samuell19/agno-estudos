[clock chimes] Just what I needed to make me a well man. [exhales] Terry Evans, if you ever do that again, I'll... ...I'll chloroform you, so help me! Uh-uh, remember it is the duty of a nurse to give a man the kind of medicine he needs to make him well. It's not the medicine I object to, it's the method of application. Oh, very well, I think I can stand another dose. Let's have a demonstration of your method. You may proceed with the treatment, nurse. [man] I'm afraid your case is hopeless, Dr. Evans. Uh, oh, hello, Doctor Maynard. I... I thought you were at the hospital. Well, I, uh, I got through sooner than I expected. [chuckling] I came back to take care of a few things. I see. Well, if you can postpone taking care of them for a few minutes... ...I'd like to see both you and Miss Drake in my office. Yes, sir. Fred and I have been checking the blood supply record. It's happened again. You mean there's more of it missing? Twelve pints. I can't understand it. Why would anybody want to steal blood? I don't know, but I'm going to report the matter to the police in the morning. And Fred, I want you to put a lock on that refrigerator. Yes, sir. Well, I guess that's all. Oh, Terry? Yes, sir. I'm going to let you handle that MacDonald case by yourself. By myself? That's a pretty delicate operation. Have you any doubt about performing it? No, sir. Neither have I. Thank you, sir. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Goodnight, sir. - Goodnight, Doctor. - Goodnight, Terry. I didn't hear you enter. What can I do for you? My wants are simple, Dr. Maynard, very simple... ...blood. Blood? That's a strange request. I'm a strange man, Doctor. Don't you remember me? Your face is familiar... ...but I can't place you. Your choice of words is ironic, Doctor. Five years ago you placed me... ...in the Brookdale Mental Institute! I wasn't insane, but who'd listen to me after Rufus Maynard, the great brain specialist, had given his learned opinion? You still don't recognize me? My card. Murks! Ormand Murks! I see that refreshes your memory. Takes you back four years, doesn't it? To the night Dr. Garland, the house physician, rushed me here from the institute. [thunder] It's no use. I can't understand it, except for a pathological brain disorder, he seems physically sound. He was physically sound, in perfect health. [thunder] It doesn't make sense. There are a lot of things about Murks that don't make sense. For example, why did he continually ask for blood transfusions? It was a fixation with him and the main reason I had him committed to your institution. He seems to feel that periodic transfusions would guarantee him a kind of immortality. Do you think there's anything in it? Nonsense. [thunder] I can't help thinking that Murks kept hidden some phase of his case history. Perhaps the autopsy will... Impossible. He must have had a premonition of his death. Just this morning he gave instructions to have his body turned over to his brother for burial in the family mausoleum, on their estate at Greenwood Knoll. Well, then, I guess the case is closed. [thunder] But, you were wrong, Doctor, the case was not closed. But, I saw your body. I examined you. You were dead! Unfortunately, one who has confined his studies to the problems of the living is not in a position to judge. To you death is merely an absence of life. There is no intermediate stage. But, that is where we disagree. For I have discovered a world in between... A world of living death. In my former profession, death was an everyday occurrence to me. I began to wonder... would it be possible for a man to appear to be dead, and still be alive? The thought fascinated me. It became an obsession. I gave up everything to find the answer. And at last... ...I found it... ...in a land of voodoo rites and devil potions, where your profession has no place. The Valley of the Zombies! You seem skeptical, Doctor. [laughs] So was I, until I tried it. Perhaps... ...if you... No? Well, I don't blame you. For once you've taken it, there's only one thing that will counteract its effect. Blood! So it was you who have been stealing it? Indirectly, yes. And now I'm here for some more! Quickly... there's no time to lose! Of course, of course, I'll, I'll phone the hospital at once and have them... Hospital? And have my affliction publicized in the newspapers and medical journals, to be exhibited as some strange monstrosity before an amphitheater of prying experimentalists? Never! But I have no blood your type here. You wouldn't lie to me. You can see for yourself! The supply is in the treatment room. Then, I'll have to take yours. I happen to know we're the same type. You will have the pleasure of contributing to the cause of science, and I'll have the satisfaction I've been waiting for so long! [choking] [clock chimes] Ormand! So my dear brother has finally gotten around to thinking about me. Why are you here? Why shouldn't I be, when you failed me? I haven't failed you. Dr. Maynard was becoming suspicious. I had to wait for an opportunity, but you'd have got it tonight. Would I? And where would you get it? There's none of my type here! This is your type. I put it in this container to fool Dr. Maynard. [chuckles] Wh... why, what's so funny? I was just thinking how well you fooled him. Dr. Maynard! What have you done to him? Need you ask? When I agreed to help, you gave me your word there'd be none of this! When I need blood, I must have it. But not this way! Any way. All right, then I'm through. For years I've sacrificed everything for you. I've taken one job after another, stealing like a common thief, but I'm not going to do it any longer! Give me the police. I'd think twice if I were you, dear brother. Remember, you're implicated in this also. I'll tell them you kept me under a hypnotic spell. For four years? So they don't believe me. I don't care. I'm not going to be a party to murder! I'll put you back in the grave where you belong! [man over phone] Police Department, hello? Hello? Police Department. Police Department. Police Department! Police Department! Hello?! [hangs up] You're going to put me in my grave? [car approaching] What do you suppose he was doing? Well, he wasn't diggin' potatoes. I'd better call headquarters. Car 60 calling headquarters. [man over police radio] Go ahead Car 60. This is Tiny. We're at the old Greenwood Knoll Cemetery. We just surprised a guy trying to plant a stiff. It looks like a job for the coroner. R-P-C. Okay, stand by. [police siren] [Tiny] The fellow over at the gas station heard the guy diggin' and called us. When we got here he took it on the I am. [detective 1] Did you take a look around? [cop] Yeah, but it was no dice in this jungle. [detective 1] What kind of a guy was he? [Tiny] Tall, kinda skinny, wore a long black coat and hat. We were too far away to see his face. Well, it wasn't robbery because here's his billfold with money in it. "Rufus Maynard, M.D., 1609 Terminal Building." Hey, I've heard of him. He's a big brain specialist. Have you figured out yet what killed him, Doc? Strangulation by somebody with a pair of strong hands. [detective 1] How long has he been dead? I can't tell. What's the matter, is it a secret? The body has been expertly embalmed. Embalmed?! That's the work of an undertaker, isn't it? [medical examiner] Yes, but anyone with a knowledge of medicine could do it. Well, this is something to work on. Let's go over to Dr. Maynard's office and see if we can pick up a clue that will lead us to this peculiar party that has a passion for pickling. [clock chimes] [whispering] Wait a minute! [whispering] What is it? There's a body on the table. - Maybe they... - Shhh! [screams] Susan, what's... What is this, a holdup? No, we're detectives from the homicide bureau. Who are you? I'm Dr. Evans. Who are you and what are you doing on this table? I was taking a nap while the doctor was working. I'm Susan Drake. I... It's a funny place to take a nap, isn't it? Not so bad, I often use it. Oh, you come here quite often, huh? Yes, I do. I'm one of the doctor's nurses. Look, why all the questions? How'd you get in here? What's this all about? Are you sure you don't know? Know what? When did you see Dr. Maynard last? Why, about eight o'clock when we left the office. Who is "we"? Miss Drake, Fred Mays, the chemist and myself. Is there anything wrong with Dr. Maynard? Nothing a little strangling and a shot of embalming fluid didn't cure. You don't mean he's dead? Oh, no! Oh, yes! We found his body about an hour ago in the old Greenwood Knoll Cemetery. You said he was embalmed? Yes... and professionally! And a man in a black overcoat was trying to bury him. Did you catch him? No, but we will. Where did you go when you left here at eight o'clock? Why, Miss Drake and I went to the Community Hospital. I have a patient there in critical condition. Where did you go from there and what time? Miss Drake's home for dinner about eight-forty-five, I'd say came back here about ten. I had some tests to make. You know where I can find this Fred Mays? He lives at the Eastern Hotel. Have you any idea who killed Dr. Maynard? Not the slightest. Thanks a lot, Doc. We'll be seeing you later. Goodnight. - Goodnight. - [Susan] Goodnight. Terry, I think those detectives suspect us. Naturally, it's their business to suspect everyone until they find the murderer. Doctor Maynard... I can't believe it. Yeah, it's quite a jolt. You know, I was wondering if there could be any connection between his death and the missing blood. Whoever stole that blood could have come back here to steal some more and been surprised by Dr. Maynard. Let's see if any more is missing. Everyone seemed to like Dr. Maynard so, I can't imagine who'd want to kill him. [Susan screams] Oh! It's Fred! Give me a hand, Susan. What's the matter? A nurse afraid of a body? No, I, I just don't care for the way it was presented. Remind me not to look in my icebox when I get home. He's been embalmed too. First Dr. Maynard, now Fred. Who's going to be next, Terry? That's what I'm wondering. We'd better call the police. No, wait a minute. Let's not be in a hurry about this. I think... I had a hunch it would pay us to drop back here. If this guy sits up and screams, I'll turn in my badge. - [Susan] No! No! - [detective 1] Yes! - [detective 2] Yes! - [Susan] No! - [detective 1] Yes! - No! No, no, no, no, no, for the millionth time, no! I had nothing to do with killing Dr. Maynard, Fred Mays or anybody else. You're more stubborn than my wife! Questioning you is like riding a merry-go-round all night. You wind up where you start. You mean the ride's over? Not by a jugful. [all whispering] Hey! Where do you think you are? I know where I wish you were! I could go for some of that coffee, myself. Not until you say "yes". All right, yes! - Yes what? - Yes, I'd like some coffee! Well, you can quit your stalling now, sister, and tell us the truth. Your boyfriend's just confessed. He has! Yes, we have it all down here in black and white. Is that so? Well, whatever Dr. Evans says he did, I helped him. You're pretty smart, aren't you! Bring him in! Well, well, good morning, nurse. And how are all your patients? A little frayed, I'm afraid. - Uh-huh... - Listen, you two... ...suspicion of murder is a pretty serious charge, and we're going to hold you two until we... [door opening] Get anything out of them? No, not yet, but we will. The motive is a natural. She's his girl, he was Dr. Maynard's associate. He bumped off the doctor to take over his rich clientele. The chemist was wise, so they bumped him off, too. They've been in custody since midnight, haven't they? Twelve-fifteen. Well, release 'em. But, Chief! You... This isn't for publication, the body of a cab driver, neatly embalmed, was just found in his taxi cab at the corner of 3rd and Witmore. Another one? But, that's nothing to let 'em loose on. They probably put 'em there themselves. That's it! They hired the guy to drive 'em over to the graveyard, then they bumped 'em off so he wouldn't talk, and then they parked his car. The cab was left there less than an hour ago. Yeah, but they could have had an accomplice, couldn't they? That's why I say, let 'em go. Oh... I just convinced the Inspector that you were innocent. You can go now. Go? But you just said... I said you can go! But, I don't understand! You just said that... Look, I've been arguin' with you for eight hours and I'm tired of it! Either you go, or I will! Isn't it too bad, we were just beginning to enjoy it here, too. Come on, Susan. Well, goodbye, gentlemen. If you ever need a shot of embalming fluid, uh, come up and see me sometime. You know a man has to be in jail before he appreciates what it means to open doors for himself. You said it. I'm certainly glad they're through with us. I'm not so sure they are. Why? The police are not freeing suspects in an unsolved murder case without a good reason. It might be a trick on their part to give us a little more rope, before they hang us with it! You mean, unless they find the killer, we're the most likely candidates to succeed? Mm-hm, that's the general idea, so it behooves us to do everything in our power to clear ourselves. [taps receiver] Well, fine. What's the matter? I wanted to call the hospital and the phone's dead. Dying is getting to be a habit around here. Hey! No wonder, the cord's broken. It's been pulled out. How do you suppose that happened? Well, it could've happened in a struggle. Nothing else seems to be disturbed. Well, it was no accident because the ends were stuck neatly back into the bell box. What's this record card doing in the waste basket? "Ormand Murks, Nature of disorder: Abnormal pressure on the fourth ventricle resulting in manic-depressive insanity." "Committed to Brookdale Mental Institute October 18th, 1939." Hey, maybe he's the murderer, an escaped lunatic. "Died: Ju... died June 12th, 1941!" For a minute I thought we had something there. So did I. It must've fallen off the desk. I'll put it back in the file. Terry! Listen to this! "Body interred in mausoleum on family estate at Greenwood Knoll." Well, once they're dead, what difference does it make where they put them? But that graveyard where Dr. Maynard was found is at Greenwood Knoll. Hey, that's right! Maybe this card has something to do with the case after all. We have to go to the hospital right now, but when we're through, we are going to pay a little visit to the Murks' estate! Oh, no we are not! This is something for the police to handle. Why, the police'll laugh at evidence like this. Don't forget, we're number one on their hate parade. But Terry, I'm no good at playing detective, I scare too easily. Oh! [laughs] Ah... see what I mean! Yes. [radio playing] I still think we should let the police handle this. If we go prowling around some strange place, we're liable to get in trouble. And we're liable to solve the mystery, too! You know, I think you're a frustrated detective. I am. When I was a kid, it was my great ambition. I saved up a 150 bottle caps once, to get a badge. Now, we'll see whether I've missed my calling. Heaven help me! [man to broadcast a special bulletin. Dr. Lucifer Garland, staff psychiatrist at the Brookdale Mental Institute, has disappeared under strange circumstances... Dr. Garland? If anyone has any knowledge of his whereabouts, please get in touch with the police department at once. Dr. Garland is 51... - I was talking with him only yesterday! ...of medium height, dark hair and weighs 160 pounds. When last seen, he was wearing a dark suit, white shirt, blue tie, black shoes and socks. We repeat, please communicate with the police department immediately if you have any information concerning Dr. Garland"s whereabouts. There's a connection between all this somewhere. [Radio music resumes] And it's not a good one either. Look, Susan, when we get there you'd better drop me off and go on back to town. And leave you alone? Well, there's no telling what I might run into. Well, we'll run into it together. You might need help, and I'm good at screaming. Well, there's the Greenwood Knoll gas station. We'd better drive in there and find out where the Murks place is. Well, there doesn't seem to be anybody around. There's a man under that car. Ah... Good evening. [louder] Good evening! Gas station's closed. I, uh, I don't want any gas, just a little information. Could you tell me where the old Murks estate is? Murks estate? There's no one livin' there, hasn't been for five years. Well, uh, if you don't mind, I'd still like to know where it is. Interested in buyin'? Yes, yes. It's on the street back of the gas station, adjoinin' the cemetery. Turn off's about half a mile up the road. It's easy to miss, better leave your car here and cut through the lot. Okay, thanks. Well, you still want to go? No, but I'm going. All right. Well, this is it. Shall we go calling? I'm really not in the mood. Locked... Maybe we can't get in, I hope. There's a pedestrian gate. [squeaks] My dear. How about some of that flashlight? No, no, nothing doing. If there's anything in there, we want to sneak up on it. Unless it sneaks up on us first. What are you... What are you going this way for, the house is over there. - A good detective always... - Shhh! [whispering] A good detective always cases the joint first. What did you say? He always looks the ground over first so he won't fall in a trap. - Ohhhh! - Oh, Terry! I'm all right, give me a hand. Oh! Well, that's one way of finding traps! Yeah, it must be a compost pit, where they make fertilizer. You better watch your step or they'll be making fertilizer out of you. Yeah, uh... Listen... - I heard something. - It's my heart pounding. It came from over there somewhere. Stay close to me. If I get any closer, we'll both be wearing the same shoes. [cow moos] [both scream] Just a cow. Probably scared it as much as it scared us. If we did, some farmer's going to get curdled milk in the morning. Uh, nice bossy. What's this place? I don't know. M-U-R-K-S, Murks. Must be the mausoleum where the Murks family is interred. Yeah, let's have a look. - No, Terry! - Why not? We're not on a fossil hunt, we're supposed to be looking for a murderer. Afraid of skeletons, eh? Coward! I don't see how you ever became a nurse. Well, I can't help it if I'm allergic to them. I don't even like a skeleton key. Oh, brother! [Susan] That one's empty! So's that one! Well, there's room for another gruesome twosome. Uh-oh... somebody's been in here and recently! Look at those footprints in the dust. [Susan] I'm not anxious to put mine alongside of them. Let's go! [Terry] "Ormand Murks, 1887, 1941." Hey, this crypt hasn't been sealed! What are you gonna do?! Well, as long as we've come this far, I'm gonna say "hello" to Mr. Murks. Well, you can say "hello" but I'm saying "goodbye!" [screaming] Terry! Terry! Terry! Why, that veil's very becoming to you. Oh! Take it off! Afraid of a few cobwebs... It's not the cobwebs, it's the spiders in them. There, that's the best I can do. Now look, hold this, will ya? And stay put. [Susan] It's empty. Yeah... Looks like the tenant has broken his lease. Susan, do you suppose it's possible that Murks isn't really dead? How could that be? We saw the record. Maybe Dr. Maynard was mistaken. Say for example, that Murks was in a sort of cataleptic state which only simulated death. It's happened before, you know. But the embalming would... How do we know he was embalmed? His brother claimed the body. He might have been in on the deception. The first thing you know you'll be saying he's a zombie! Well, there aren't supposed to be such things, but... [door closing] Terry! The door! Somebody's got us right where they want us! Now, don't let your imagination run away with you, after all doors have closed by themselves. Well, it doesn't take any imagination to know we're going to suffocate unless we get out of this place in a hurry. Will you please stop talking, you're burning up all the oxygen. Susan, stand over here a minute. Well, that didn't work. I thought maybe I could shoot the lock off. Well, what's next, Mr. Detective? Or do you realize now you didn't miss your calling! Go ahead, I deserve it for dragging you into this. But, believe me if we get out of this, we're going to make a beeline for home. There... Look out. [crash] Oh! Darling, you're wonderful! Now, lets play bee and buzz away from here. What do you mean, quit now? I certainly do! We're just getting warmed up. Well, I don't care to get any warmer! I've had enough for one night. I'm not going another step! This was your... ...idea in the first place. Terry, wait for me! Here, hold this, Susan. Aww, it's no use! I've got to get something to pry with. Hey... the door's open! Banging on the window must've jarred it open. I've got a feeling somebody opened it... ...a cold, clammy feeling! If I had your imagination, I'd write stories. And if I had your nerve, I'd head for that front gate by myself and not wait for you! All right, all right, shhh! [Susan] This must've been some sort of a... a reception room. Yeah. I wonder what kind of business Murks was in. Empty. What do I smell? Disinfectant? Formaldehyde. Embalming fluid! Could be. Locked! Also locked! Well, this one isn't and I'm keeping it open! Here's the answer to the business he was in. An undertaking establishment! So Murks was an undertaker, huh? This place gives me the creeps! Please, Terry, let's go before I become a fit subject for one of those pine boxes myself! Oh! [Terry] It's Dr. Garland! That explains the smell of the embalming fluid. This is horrible, Terry! Yeah, it's time we called the police. It's over time. Come on! You're so right! [screams] Terry, are you hurt? No, not much. Then, why don't you get up? I'm looking for my gun and flashlight. Help me find 'em! Never mind them, let's find the police. Terry... Huh? You administer the anesthetic when I grab him. Oh, can't we just run? Shhhh! Get ready! Nice work, nurse, now we'll have a look at him. [Susan] Oh! It's Blair, the detective. Well, where did he come from? Ah, you two get around, don't you? Who is it this time? Blair! Keep 'em covered, Tiny. He's only been knocked unconscious. It's Hendricks, Blair, you're okay. Did you get his number? Nobody ran over you. You were cold-cocked with a club. So we caught up with you two at last, huh? And are we glad. You're just the men we want to see. I didn't get that impression over at Clark Drive. - Clark Drive? - Now, don't act innocent! You two knew we were tailing you and you gave us the slip. It was only a lucky break when we found your car over at the gas station. Why that's ridiculous. We didn't know you were... We can argue about that later, Susan. Right now there are more important things. Do you know who we found in the house? No! But do you know who we found in your car over at the gas station? The station attendant, and dead! [Terry and Susan] Dead? Yes and embalmed! Now, who did you find? Dr. Garland in the same condition. Tiny, call up the gas station and tell 'em to send over the other police car. You two show us Dr. Garland. Calling Car 63, 63. Calling Car 63. [man over police radio] 63 answering, can't you hear me? I can now, this transmitting button sticks. We picked up the guy and girl over at the old house near the graveyard. Blair says for you to come over as soon as you can, okay? This thing is stuck for sure now. If any calls come from headquarters, be sure and take 'em down. We can't do nothin' but broadcast on this set. Huh, nice cozy little hideout you've got here. It's not our hideout, tonight's the first time we ever saw this place and I wish I couldn't even say that! This was the embalming room. The body's right there. Right where? Well, it was right there not ten minutes ago! Well, maybe he got tired of waiting and went out to get a short beer. This is no gag! Murks must have taken it away. Murks? Who's Murks? He's an insane man, criminally insane. This is his place. We learned about it from Dr. Maynard's records. We think he's the one who's been committing all the murders. Yeah, go on. He died four years ago at the Brookdale Mental Institute. Died four years... he died four years ago. She means he died according to the records, but he's not really dead, because his coffin's empty. Look, I know this sounds crazy, but... No, no, no, it's perfectly logical. - He died four years ago... - Yes. -...but he's not really dead... - No. ...because his coffin is empty? - That's right! - Just a minute! So help me, I know one crazy guy there won't be any doubt about. His coffin's in the mausoleum right now. If you'll go out there with me, I'll prove it to you. I've always been a sucker for a sleigh ride. Let's go. Wait a minute. Hey, Tiny, you stay here with her and put the bracelets on her so she won't start to play hide and seek with you. - Hey, what's up? - You stay in front of us! This is really unnecessary, you know. I wouldn't try to get out of your sight in this place for a dozen pair of nylons! I'm just carrying out orders, lady. [footsteps] Who's upstairs? I wish I didn't know! [footsteps] He's coming down the backstairs! [footsteps] He's in the embalming room! Shhhh! [screams] Oh! Is this joint haunted? [Tiny] Come out from behind that screen! Come on! Oh, you won't, eh? [thud] Did... did you get him? [gasps] Yes, I got him! Terry! I'm afraid your liberty's rather restricted without... ...this key. [hysterically] Terry! [Blair] I thought you said this coffin was empty! It is, I mean, it was. Well anyhow, that's not Murks, it's Dr. Garland. Dr. Garland! Dark hair, dark clothes, white shirt, blue tie, black... I think it is! Let's get back to the house! We'll throw a police cordon out and comb the place with a fine-tooth comb. - Where's Tiny? - Where's Susan? Hey, Tiny, where are you? Susan! [groan] What's that? What's the matter with you? I heard a noise in there, I thought he was hidin' behind the screen. He was behind a coffin. Where's Miss Drake? She's handcuffed to that cabinet over there. Murks! We've gotta find them before he... We'll search the house first. [car starting] Wait! That's my car! Be careful, he's got my gun! There it goes! [Blair] Here, someone stole my car, go and get 'em! - They have their lights on? - Yes. I don't see their tail lights in front of us. Which way? It's anybody's guess. Maybe they didn't even come this far. They might've pulled off the road and stopped. I know how to find out! Their radio's gone haywire and they're broadcasting all the time. We can pick 'em up on this one. [car motor] That's their motor and they're not standing still! Now, if we could just tell which road they're on. Yeah, that's where we're stymied. [crossing bell] What's that? [crossing bell] Sounds like a railroad crossing bell. - [train whistle] - It is! Hear the train? [crossing bell] They're on Clark Drive! Step on it! [static] What could be makin' that noise? Some kind of inference. It could be that big electric power station on Valley Drive. So far, so good. Yeah, but we haven't gained on 'em very much. [traffic noises] Ah, that's what I was afraid of. He's in the downtown traffic. No chance of telling what street he's on now. [clock chimes] That's the tower clock on the terminal building. [clock chimes] [motor stops] And he stopped his motor! He's going back to your office. [clock chimes] Tiny, you stay here. Joe, you come with us and watch the front. Susan! Susan! Have you gone mad? [Susan] Drop those guns! Drop them! Mad because she helps me? No, my dear doctor, she's not mad. Unfortunately, some of my recent blood donors have been the wrong type, so I had to take advantage of your facilities, and your nurse very kindly assisted me. Now, if you gentlemen will step to one side, we will take our... departure. Thank you. After you my dear. Susan! Save your breath, Doctor, she's no longer your nurse... ...she's mine! [shots] He's headed for the roof. I'll go up the stairs. No! Susan! Susan, what's the matter with you? [Murks] She's hypnotized, Doctor... ...and she's going to stay that way! As for you... ...let her have that gun. Now, my dear, you may shoot him. [gunshot] Susan... Susan! Terry! You're all right now, darling. Oh, I feel like I've been dreaming. Well, I'm glad you woke up when you did. - I think I need a drink. - I think I need one, too. Let's get a Zombie. Zombie, oh! [chuckles]
