Yeah, Nandu uncle. I reached London. I like my room. City is beautifully decorated with lights, as it is Christmas. I’ll start working from tomorrow. By the way, what is your friend’s restaurant name? Okay! Amara, right! See you, uncle. Bye. Greetings! Under an appeasing moonlight in London, Here’s a beautiful song to indulge you. Oh, yeah! Bass! Keys. “Today is a new dawn” “My world awakens and sparkles” “Loneliness along the way” “Accompanied with stars” Mother earth never slumbers” Yeah! “This is my place I am this way” “How can I ever sleep? Eyes don’t slumber” “That’s my identity No one’s like me” “My eyes don’t snooze in waiting” “Brightness is filled around” “Moon shines bright at night” “Everyday I see may pass away like this” “Dawn and dusk get friendly with me” “A beautiful smiles on lips” “Words takes us along a mellow path” “Let there be sleep or no sleep at all” “A melody in the air” “A pure joy in the heart” “Let this life move on happily” Hey? Sorry? [SNORTING] On my first day, even I saw everything so amusingly. I cook soups and starters here. You’re new to this hotel, right? It’ll take some time to adjust. Yeah! It is a 5-star rated restaurant. Oh! He’s Mr. Finger Bowl! Hi. Hi. Good morning, head chef! Do your work. There are three rules in the kitchen. Rule Number 1! Bags, Purse, Wallet, Mobile, and ego aren't allowed in here. Put them here in the locker before entering. Rule Number 2! Usually, one chef cooks in the kitchen, and others eat. But here, everyone cooks for themselves. So, there are no complications or complaints. Yeah! What is rule number 3? Follow Mr. Rajesh! He’s a great chef here. Oh! Who is Rajesh? That’s me. Follow! What the hell is happening here? Do you know what time it is? It is 7 o'clock now! Who’s that? The tail! He treats himself as superior. But, he’s our senior. He is the only one in this kitchen who has seen the head chef cook. What do you mean? Doesn't the head chef cook? Uh-huh. He used to, some 15 years ago. But, we all still follow his recipes. Hey! Do you dance? That is? I keep getting muscle spasms often. What? Muscle spasms! Oh! I have to be a little careful around him. Does that girl have a bad memory? Why is she washing her hands again and again? By now, she has already washed her hands three-four times. She has OCD. She cannot be stable if everything around isn’t clean. From all that washing even the prints in her hands have faded It is 7.25! It would be 8 in 30 minutes. What should I do? Who’s that? Sir! I am cutting vegetables. Go, sir. I love you. Hey! Get rid of that clock. Keeps checking the clock every half hour and kills us Cleopatra! Please give me a neck massage. I have pain. Fresh fish! Coconut for garnishing! [GIGGLING] What? Fresh meat! Nandu’s nephew right? Yes, chef. I’m Dev. Tara. Gavin! Hmm. [GULP] You have access only to the kitchen. The door is not in good condition here. They said they would repair it in a week. Follow up with them. Use the door carefully until then. Open it and place this wedge in the gap. Otherwise, you will get stuck inside. The emergency button doesn’t work either. What should I cook here? Please tell me. What you’re here to do, is not cooking. It’s cleaning. Cleaning uh? It has been a month since I joined. I myself haven’t got any chance to cook yet. First, you need to work on cutting, cleaning, and sorting. You shouldn’t do anything but cook breakfast for yourself. I’d share the head chef recipes sometimes. You can practice at home. Be careful! That’s a sacred thing for us. Hey? [SNORTS] What’s this? I keep getting muscle spasms often. Sorry. [BANGING] Has everyone understood? -Chef! It is really nice. It’s a match! Stop slacking off and get back in here. Why do you shout, man? Silly idiot! Do you think we’re deaf? Kindly get lost. Stupid fellow. Okay? Get inside. Come on. Come on. Let’s go. [INDISTINCT VOICES] Careful! Hey? What are you doing? Hey! Hmm. Dev! Hey?Hey! Dev. Be careful. I keep getting?MUSCLE SPASMS Sorry. Often! Sorry? Sorry! Dev! It’s time to cook breakfast. Look for a subtle change in the texture. That’s when you add ginger. Feel the aroma. What? Doesn’t the Chef eat? We haven’t seen him eating till now. Is it? What about tasting before service? You’ll see. Butter Chicken and Rumali Roti for Table 4! Hyderabadi Biryani! There’s something wrong with it. Are you doing it again? Of course! He would toss it off again if I don’t do it again He turns his face like this if it’s good. Then, the dish goes out for service. Hey, finger bowl! Get me corn flour. How did you know by the way? Leave it. Service! Gone! Okay. Yay! Enjoy! Have you had this problem since childhood? No, this got launched around 5 years back I heard that you have insomnia too. Can't you sleep at night? That is? Hey? Tom? Hey! Good looking, isn’t she? What are you doing? Tara also came in through head chef’s recommendation. If he comes to know that you like her, he’d sniff and smash you like a dish. No chance? What? Smashing? Staring at Tara? What else? Nothing! Come with me. I’ll show you around London. London? I didn’t mean what you think it is. The real London. It’ll be amazing. Come. This vehicle doesn’t work for us. Let’s walk. The tissue is a big issue here. I was uncomfortable at the beginning. You should never trust the weather and women here. They will cheat us. Tara is a bit different. Be careful with her. Okay? Okay? She’s a devotee of head chef. She is like a modern Hanuman to her Rama. If the head chef recipe says, add 3 mustard seeds. She’d put exactly 3. Even if one seed were to fall in, by mistake, she’d go mad [SCREAMS] She came here a month ago. She spends all her time with a watch and sanitizers. OCD! Oh! I wonder how her husband would stand her. [GIGGLES] How about the girl who’d marry you? Let’s go. It started drizzling man. Hey, bro! Look there. That’s a night market. It is quite famous. Our head chef is the reason why it is famous. Everyone started going here once they found out the head chef was visiting that place. And with that, it became super famous. Is our head chef that famous? Yeah. Of course! He explored the world 20 years ago. He tasted different cuisines. Finally, he started his restaurant. Then, he became a chef. He never looked back after that. You know what? He even got a Michelin star. Why does our head chef look so moody then? What’s the problem? He’s always like that. Don’t mind him. Be it any dish, he’d tell all the ingredients just by looking. His wife and daughter left him 15 years back. He gave up everything ever since then. He gave up cooking and the joy of it. But, he couldn’t let them off his mind. That’s why he named the restaurant after his daughter. Amara! Sad, isn’t it? What the hell are you doing? Get back to work! You always scold me. I have the noblest face here and you always blame me. No! It's okay. Come here. You'll be alright. Get back to work, okay? Ms. Tara! [SCREAMS] Quick!!! How can he say whether the food is tasty or not by just looking at it? A lot of food is wasted every day. Mind your own work and leave. He was?he is?and he’ll always be one of the best chefs in the world. Tara! Oh! Whatever it is, will it be as good as we make it? It’s a 20-year old recipe! Shall we eat, brother? (Imitating a famous Telugu actor) Chicken Biryani for table no.5! Make it quick. Hey! What are you doing? Nothing, Ms. Tara! It'll be better if we just make a few corrections. Who are you to decide that? Do you know how long Tom has been working here? He knows all the chef's recipes. You need to correct yourself first. Then, you can correct these recipes. Ms. Tara! These recipes we make aren’t actually the chef’s recipes. The recipe includes all the ingredients needed. But it doesn't say what to add and how long to cook them. Maybe that’s why, the chef gets angry and tosses the food around. Hey! Those recipes would come out well if we make it just the way he wants it. Hey! Go tell the chef that you’ve put some random shit in it. Otherwise, he’d toss it off. Ms. Tara! Go. Service! Service! Service! Service! Service! Service! Dev! It’s delicious. Hey! Save some for me. Dev, this is fantastic You are a star. Hey! Are you okay? No?I’m okay? Yeah?okay! Guys! Come on. Chicken Soup to table no.4! Hey, Dev! Can you get me some chicken broth from Paul? Okay. Dev! Are you okay? I was worried that something bad happened to you. Please take care. I’m Okay. Hey. Hey, Dev! Hey! Go! Go. [SHUDDERING] Service! Thank you. Wow! Fantastic! See the reaction. Now you're officially the Chef of this kitchen. -Dev! Mind-blowing. Awesome. Ms. Tara? You look angry. Have I done something wrong? And if I have, I’m sorry. Hi. 1?2?3?4?5! Chef! You’re new here, right? How do you know about this place? Rajesh showed it to me. He said you’d come here often. Are you going to eat THAT? Come. Better things are there! For you? You know, one day Nandu called me and said to hire you in my kitchen. And I said it wouldn't be possible because I had enough staff already. You know what he said? Hmm? He said it would be the biggest loss for my kitchen if I didn’t. Chef! Can I ask you something? Don’t take me wrong. Hmm. Why did you give up cooking? Amara! How’s the chicken? Fantastic. Actually, this is a Turkish chicken. But it wasn't this good even when I had tasted it in Turkey. It is their?secret family recipe. Can’t we cook it? No? But that’s the beauty of it. Some things are better left untouched! See you tomorrow. Bye, chef. Ginger, garlic, poppy seeds, desiccated coconut, black cumin, Nutmeg, Cloves, Soya sauce, Cardamom! Tom! Tom. Tom! Tom! Tom! I just wanted to get in first. I know that you don’t eat anything in the morning. But, today? Just this day? Please have this. The Turkish Chicken that we had yesterday, chef. The color wasn’t a match. So, I added some food color to it. I'm expecting Dev to get a Michelin star too. Chef. Eggs. What is he doing? Something new! He keeps adding things without looking. That's how he is. Write it down quickly. It is a new recipe. He knows Telugu? You won’t get it another time. Shut up and write quickly. Okay. Bro... Head chef! He's cooking exactly like how Dev cooks. I’ll see you tomorrow, guys. Merry Christmas! Oh, god! I can't believe that it's already Christmas. Merry Christmas! What? Open the door. Open the door! Anybody there? Open the door! Sandy! Rajesh! Somebody, please open the door. Haven’t I told you that the door gets jammed? Did you not place the wedge? Useless fellow! You’re not good at anything. Open the door! Hello! Somebody, please help. Tom! Rajesh! Oh, God! Hello! Are you guys there? Hello! Somebody open the door. Anybody there? Anybody! [QUIVERING]: Hello! Help! Hello! Help. Is anybody there? Tom. Someone open the door! Help? Hello! Rajesh! Hello! Please. Tom. Hello. Open the door. [QUIVERING] Hello. [QUIVERING] Hello! How did you do it? In hot water... I just added whatever I could get my hands on. How? Spring onions? Yeah. How much? Whatever I got in my hand. And next? Ginger! How much? This much. 1?2?3?4?5 Maybe two more! What the hell! How, Dev? How do you do this? How can you add without measuring? I got used to it, Ms. Tara. Ms. Tara! Sorry. My hand just moved automatically. What’s wrong with you, Dev? Sorry, Ms. Tara. It happened unintentionally. No! I’m talking about this. And you! Your spasms! What happened to you? It has been like this for the past 5 years. You talk to someone at times. You gesture as if there’s someone beside you. Was I talking? No. In fact when the storage room door jammed, you looked away and asked ‘what’! What? Hmm? What’s happening? Did I talk? No. Dev! Don’t lie. What’s your problem? Tell me. Your expression says it all. Will you tell me or not? Tell me, Dev. I... -Tell me! I had a childhood friend. We grew up together. 5 years ago... She died. And even though she is dead, I can see her. She talks to me. All of this happens to me because of her. Is she here now? Yeah. She is beautiful, isn’t she? Maya! We lived like two souls in a single heart. She’s filled in the most part of my world. I’ve never known a world without her. Our parents are family friends. We were neighbors. When I was 5? Maya. Maya. Get up. What? Hush. Calm down, dear. Maya. Okay? Don’t cry. Okay? Okay, sleep. Did Maya come? They both are sleeping. So comfortably! She cries if I take her. She went back to sleep as soon as he hugged her. Don’t worry. Let her sleep here. I’ll take care. Eat a little. Just one. Eat. Eat. Eat, dear. Eat this. Wait. I’ll be back. She eats only if I cook. I learned cooking for her. She has changed my ways of cooking. The thing she loved the most? Desserts. One more. Okay. Bye? Okay. I’ll see you in the morning. Don’t forget. Yeah! Maya! You go, mom. I’ll sleep here. Maya! Maya! Come. I won’t come. I said come. I’ll slap you. I won’t come, mom. Come. I won’t come. I said come. Hey! Come. Deva! Mom! I won’t come. Hey! Come here? Akbar bhai! Good morning. Good morning. 4 teas for me, please! And Vada too. Okay, dear. Your breakfast is ready! Thank you. Bye? Bye? No one takes responsibility. I wanted to make this the safest zone in India. But, none of you work properly. They want salaries on time. See... Aunty! Good morning. Good morning. How are you able to wake up early in the morning every day? I’ll deduct salaries from next time. - On a day like this? How can I not wake up? I wish your friend does the same. Okay. This is for you. I’ll go and wake him up. Do you understand? Dev! Wake up.

Hi, darlings! Nandu uncle! Hi, uncle. What’s special today? Ancho Salmon! Shall we eat? Eating fish so damn early in the morning! Serve me Sambar. Dev! This is delicious. Your place isn’t here. There's a friend of mine in the UK. Michelin star chef! - I’ll get more. Wait. You'd gain a good experience if you work for him. Okay. First do a course on hotel management, We’ll do what’s needed after. You’ll become a great chef, Dev. Shut up, Nandu. How can he cook like a woman? What’s with man and woman there? It’s not just that. Can’t he find a good job. Why do he think about catering and hotel management? Have you ever taste his dishes? No need. Maya. Just one bite! Maya. Ogling at a random girl uh, Rascal? Hey! Your dad will come through one day. That’s not needed. He let’s us be as we are now, that’s enough. No? There’s more in life You can be so much happier I think you’re wasting your life. After a while, your dad or no one will be around. Everyone will leave someday. And then, when you look back to see the life you lived, You’ll wonder if you lived for yourself or for everyone else. It won’t be good. Whoever leaves, you’ll be here with me right? I won’t. Only you’ll be there for yourself Don’t change the topic. Wake up early in the morning. Enjoy the sunrise. Smile. Cook what you like. Eat till your stomach’s full.

Was it your plan to do business, To take care of the family, Forget how to smile And drink yourself to sleep every night? Okay. I’ll go and wake Dev up. Whatever it is, will it be as good as how we make it? That? What is that? Scrambled eggs. It is easy to make, mom. What next? Add pepper and oregano to give it some Italian flavor. This is one of our regular egg dishes. By adding fancy things the dish is named ‘Scrambled eggs!’. Can I taste it? This is so good, my son. Do you want to pursue hotel management? Yeah. Go for it. Do whatever you want. Go wherever you want. But, promise me that you’d always be happy. I am sorry, boy. You reminded me of my mom’s cooking. What are you saying, dad? Sorry.

How can only you see Maya when no one else can? But? But, this is enough for me Dev! He is crazy. Let’s leave. I’m not saying this for you This is for Maya. The more you believe she’s here. the more you talk to her, the more you get attached to her, the more you cling on to her soul. Weep until you realize she’s no more. Grieve! Let her leave. Cry! For her peace, you need to let her go. Listen, Dev! You’ve grown up together. - Look at me. Look at me. - But, she’s no more. See! - You miss her. That’s the only reason. Dev. There is a treatment for this. - See, Dev. I’ll prescribe medicines. - Look at me. You don’t worry. - Dev. You’ll be alright, Dev. - Dev. You’ll be alright. Dev. Deva. Devu. Deva. Look at me, Dev. Look at me. They said that the seizures and insomnia were the side effects To the treatments They gave me sleeping pills. But, even those didn’t work. The truth is?Maya has always been with me. She gets on me, plays with me. She jumps and tickles me. She’s there. It’s only me who ignores her and behaves like she isn’t. Oh no? Am I dead? Why have you killed me? Why have you killed me? Oh no? Even now, she’s shocked to know that she is dead. She is crying. Oh no? She is laughing at me. Do I look insane? Only now you make sense. She’s a good girl. A little arrogant, but good girl. Are you feeling cold? I searched for it, but couldn’t find anything to cover. That’s fine, Dev. Hey! She has OCD. Let it be. Dev! So have you not slept at all for 5 years? Dev. Devu. Deva. Okay. Tell me something about Maya. [MAYA, DEV]: What about Maya? What does Maya like? What do you like about her? Maya! “You’re the only one I need when I am weary” “All the weariness shall disappear” “My rigidity vanishes in a flash” “My heart that listens to your voice knows no thoughts” “Dreams are mysterious” “You’re my dream story” “The world around fades” “My heart gleams” “In your magical trance” “In your magical trance” “The world around me changes” “Like a endless smear” “In your magical trance” “In your magical trance” I want to eat something. Will you cook something for me? Dessert? She’s copying me. She’s copying me. I guess she likes you. Did you see it? She copied me. What should I cook? Cook whatever Maya likes. What are you doing? Isn’t it good? Do something a bit more romantic. Add some strawberries and all. When you look at it, it’ll look all romantic! The best part is the strawberries. Teach me how to cook like you, Dev. Is everything okay? Something is missing. Exactly! That’s when we improvise. Do you remember everything you smelt earlier? Hmm? Hmm. Guess what would be good added to this? Garlic! Perfect. This is my cooking. I’ll go get some wine. What’s your favorite color? White and green! How about you? Red and black! Favorite music? Raja sir. Same here. 90’s-Rahman too! Yeah. Food? Italian. And Indian-Chinese when I’m bored. How about you? Ghee Spicy Crepe! Idli with gravy! Steamed Ragi with Chicken curry! Ulavacharu Biryani! My list is lengthy. Nice. Did you work somewhere earlier? Not much! I worked at Taj Deccan in Hyderabad. I worked for a few months at Novotel in Vizag. That means you’re quite experienced. And you? This is my first job. Is it? I got here through some recommendation. I know. I heard that you're related to the head chef. Do you love the beach? I’m full. Yeah! I’m full too. Thanks. Huh? Just? thanks. She’s getting emotional. Ask her something. She’ll tell you the truth. What should I ask? Hmm? Ask her about her mother. Try it. Your mother? Mother? Ask about her father. Father? Father? What about my father? Goal! Don’t take me wrong. What do your parents do? My parents got separated when I was 8. Didn’t I tell you that she would tell you the truth? Mom took me far away from my dad. So far away that she even changed the name he gave me. I feel proud whenever I hear things about him. But now, I feel sad that he isn’t doing all that. I want to see him turn back to what he was earlier. That’s why I fought with my mom and came here. Searching for my father Searching for him and? Did you find him? Almost! Why do you cook? Dad used to cook a dish when I was young. Gold-crusted fish it was called! It’s the best thing ever. My favorite dish. I want to taste that dish. Maybe, I started cooking to taste that. I somehow feel that I may taste it again, if I just keep cooking like him. That’s it. Amara? Hey! Dev Dev! I am sorry. I don’t know what happened to me. You go? You go, Dev. Dev! I am sorry. Dev! I am sorry. Hey, Dev. I’ll get another bottle of wine. Devu... Deva... Deva... Deva...Deva... Ugh! ['Mandapeta Malakpeta ' song from 'Premikudu' playing] “My life is twitchy” “My heart is scarce” “What sort of magic is this?” “Not even a moment is steady” “Time never ends” “Sliding into my dreams” “What sort of happiness is this?” “My heart senses it This moment is special” “Happiness can’t be expressed” “It feels more like heaven” “My hearts feels light” “You got me into this trance” “My heart’s desire is limitless” “You are my new world” “I realized today” “true senses in my heart” “What sort of mystery is this?” “Everything is unveiled” “Seasons are six” “But, there’s one more now” “This loneliness? has many shades” “My happiness is boundless” “Moments of togetherness begins” “My hearts feels light” “You got me into this trance” “My heart’s desire is limitless” “You are my new world” “My hearts feels light” “You got me into this trance” “My heart’s desire is limitless” “You are my new world” ['Mandapeta Malakpeta' song continues playing] Stop it! Whoa! Dev! Dev? Dev? Dev? Dev. Dev! Dev. Dev. Dev! Tara. Dev. Dev? Dev! Don’t die. Dev! Don’t die. Don’t die. Dev? Dev. Dev. Dev! What happened? Oh, God! Dev. Dev! Get up. Get up, Dev. Dev! Dev! Don’t die. Dev! I’ll kill you if you die on me, Rascal! Dev. Dev! Don’t die. Dev! Hello. Don’t die? “Like those gusty waves” “Like a shining light” “I’m always there with you” “Your life is mine” “A moment feels like ages” “My senses become still” “I live along with your memories” “Your existence is my breath” “You are that bright smile” “My dreams never end” “You remain forever” “Listen! This is our life!” Hello. What? Get up, Dev! Don’t die. Get up. Don’t die. Don’t die. Don’t die. Don’t die. Maya. Maya! I spoke with the doctor. Dev has had a cardiac arrest due to overexertion. He’s in a critical condition. If this goes on, he can get another attack. So, he should eat less. He should exercise more. He should reduce weight. Most importantly, he should sleep well. I mean?I don’t know if you saw. Everyone from the kitchen came to see Dev. He has? He has good friends around him now. You! I am sorry, Maya. Dev would sleep happily only if you leave. I understood a lot about Dev just in one night. I want to know more. I’ll replace you in his life. Please, Maya. Dev should live. And for that to happen, you should leave. And? And I promise I’ll take care of him. I’ll take care of him just like how you did. We got stuck in the storage room. We couldn’t open the door. How is Dev? He’s out of danger. He has insomnia. Doctors said some sound sleep would help They said he’d be fine within 2 days. How about you? I? I am doing well, chef. I’ll come back to work today. You stay with Dev. Take care of him. What’s that, chef? Is it for me? Did you prepare it, chef? This is good for your heart. I made it for the first time in 15 years. Gold-crusted fish! My Amara’s favorite! I remembered her and felt like cooking. Tara! Try it. What happened? Is it good? [SOBBING] Is everything okay? You take care. You can take leave for a few days. You too! Let me know when you’re ready. It’s already late. It is 8 now. Call me if you need any help. Dad. Did you call me? No. Let’s meet in the kitchen at 5 o’clock. I need to talk. Have you found your father? Almost! Are you scared? No no? This isn’t the right place. So, I paused. I’ll probably find him this evening. What else? How was gold-crusted fish? Does it still taste the same? It was perfect. I’ll cook it for you tomorrow. Okay. How are you feeling now? Dev. Sleep, Dev. Sleep! Try to sleep. You know that I cannot sleep, don’t you? Try! Maya.
