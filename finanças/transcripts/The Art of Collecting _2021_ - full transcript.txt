MAN: I've been collecting Wizard of Oz memorabilia MAN: I've been collecting Wizard of Oz memorabilia since I was a child. since I was a child. I think at times I have been a little bit embarrassed of my collecting, but when I became an artist, it made a lot of sense. WOMAN: I'm a bit of a storyteller. I use domestic objects, given my family's history of being domestics or slaves. I often feel like when opportunities come my way, it's a bit of a sign from the ancestors. WOMAN 2: I'm a bowerbird. I'm looking for shiny things and pretty things. I love taking a container that is mass-produced and then giving it that love, the attention, that care. WOMAN 3: It's very interesting, the way materials come to me. WOMAN 3: It's very interesting, It's a strange mixture between It's a strange mixture between accepting what the universe gives you and then having intention and going out and finding things. And I love the power of things I find on the street. WOMAN 4: My collecting is like an uncontrollable obsession WOMAN 4: My collecting that will never end. that will never end. It's like a relief, that will never end. It's like a relief, coming into this house It's like a relief, and seeing all the beautiful things, and seeing all the beautiful things, forgetting about the outside world. You could say that other people's trash is my pleasure. When I was five, I watched The Wizard of Oz with my grandmother, When I was five, I watched and it was the first time and it was the first time I really looked at the world as an artist. So this is probably my most treasured item, So this is probably my VHS set, The Wizard of Oz, my VHS set, The Wizard of Oz, illustrated by yours truly in 1992. (CHUCKLES) I watched it so many times. The Cowardly Lion was the character that I felt most like. I really was pretty afraid of the world. This is terrifying. Look at those eyelashes. It's a Christmas decoration. I've got this incredible card set that was made in London I've got this incredible card set that was made in London the year the film came out. I really love the colours of these. I think at times I have been a little bit embarrassed I think at times I have been a little bit embarrassed of my collecting, but when I became an artist, it made a lot of sense. but when I became an artist, This is the inspiration for my work. This is the inspiration for my work. The work that I make is very much centred on working with people. Definitely, I was influenced by vaudeville, which The Wizard of Oz is very much influenced by. The idea of clowning is a big part of the film. And that, I feel, is maybe my role in society, a little bit. This morning, David and Teena are launching their brand new fragrance, This morning, David and Teena are Teena's Bathtime, Eau de Wet Dogge. Teena's Bathtime, Eau de Wet Dogge. Welcome, David and Teena. Good morning. Good morning, everybody. When it comes to perfume, nobody knows better than Teena. Teena and I really pursued joy and to entertain ourselves, to make ourselves laugh and others laugh too, along the way. And Teena is my Toto. She is quite a muse to me. I've learnt a lot from her. Come on, Teena. So I'm really like in the thick of renovating this house. I collect so many things and I've never really put them out. Mom and Dad looking like munchkins. My parents divorced when I was five and I ended up spending a lot of my time with my grandmother. So my grandmother got me these. They were very expensive. Poor Grandma. She was only on a pension and... (CHUCKLES) ..I just had to have them. I think I wouldn't be an artist if it wasn't for my grandma. I was able to really be shown what it is to use your imagination. This is a picture of Babcha and me. she would call me her 'syn', which in Ukrainian actually means son. My grandmother passed away around ten years ago, My grandmother passed away and the house is still there. and the house is still there. I always remember her and the house is still there. I always remember her leaning on that gate. She had this belief that if you were up at a certain hour, She had this belief that if you were if your lights were on, if your lights were on, the police would come knocking at your door. So I have really strong memories of the house being in pitch black, but the colours from the TV set would pierce through the blinds and it would look like fireworks were going on inside. My grandma, she wasn't Jewish, but she was taken away from her family in the Ukraine at 16 and forced to work in Nazi labour camps, and forced to work where I think she was sewing. where I think she was sewing. She never saw her family ever again. She carried the War with her all the time, that experience, and I do believe in intergenerational trauma and I really link it to watching the film The Wizard of Oz, because it provided a visceral escape from our reality. So, this the Baum Bugle. The Baum Bugle is the newsletter from the International Wizard of Oz Club that I've been a member of since five. I remember going to a Wizard of Oz convention in Chattanooga, which is where L. Frank Baum was born, which is where who wrote the book. who wrote the book. Went to the soundstage where they filmed Munchkinland. I was quite disturbed by a lot of things that I found out, like when the snow starts falling in the poppy field, that's actually asbestos. I think what I found most difficult about going on this big trip I think what I found most difficult was that I met people that had was that I met people that had a really strong relationship to The Wizard of Oz and I was like, "No, this is my Oz!" You know, when you confront a fantasy and then you kind of walk through it and in it, you can't go back to it because that spell has been broken. I didn't watch the film for a long time, I didn't watch the film but I just stumbled upon it on TV but I just stumbled upon it on TV and I watched it again and it soothed me. The film has always been there to kind of nurture me. I hope that it will always be with me. I often wonder why my grandmother encouraged my love for The Wizard of Oz so much, and I think she could relate to what I was doing. I was kind of, you know, escaping into Oz. I think that I make work to give people the opportunity I think that I make work to escape with me. to escape with me. Why not spend your time in a place, you know, that you've created Why not spend your time in a place, and that you've made up? and that you've made up? I like sharing that with everybody. There's no place like home. I'm a Wiradjuri-Irish-German artist. I live on Bundjalung country, just out of Lismore. I use different materials, depending on the story, I use different materials, so I'm a bit of a storyteller. so I'm a bit of a storyteller. I get most of my materials to make my art from the tip. I love the thrill of the hunt. Hey there, daughter. I like things that are broken and crusty and rusty. Look at that. Aren't they gorgeous? Little bit of an eyeball, you never know when you need an eyeball. Little bit of an eyeball, you never Loved them, as a kid. Loved them, as a kid. I often use those in my collage. I use domestic objects, given my family's history I use domestic objects, given my family's history of being domestics, or slaves, given my family's history which is probably more appropriate. which is probably more appropriate. Anything with any Indigenous story behind it. I'm kind of between projects at the moment. And often I like to prepare collage items. When I was small, I'd cut things and stick things When I was small, and that hasn't really left me. and that hasn't really left me. I ended up getting into the National Art School. I was so obsessive and compulsive about making work... ..I soon found that I couldn't afford paint. So I started to pick up different collage material on the streets of Darlinghurst. It was practical and it was financially-based. I have the justification that I collect things to my work, I have the justification which is true, which is true, but I do have to monitor myself which is true, but I do have to monitor myself and my obsessions. It was my birthday. I found this little box and it said Happy Birthday, I found this little box and I opened it. and I opened it. So they're my captain cook whiskey bottles. So they're my captain cook It was a perfect object It was a perfect object to make a series about the introduction of alcohol. Indigenous people weren't often paid with money, but they were paid with alcohol. So sometimes those objects come, you know, I kind of know straightaway that I want to use it to tell a particular story. After John Howard came into power, I went to the tip and found After John Howard came into power, I went to the tip and found that crusty old Australian flag I went to the tip and found that somebody threw out. that somebody threw out. I found a great uncomfortability with people celebrating Australia Day. So I hand-stitched black crosses over the whole flag So I hand-stitched black crosses to represent Indigenous people to represent Indigenous people that had been murdered in the Frontier Wars. When I was younger, I collected any kind of deity that I thought might protect me. The Virgin Mary, she knows pain, but the Black Madonna kind of knows the ultimate suffering. The very prominent calling I have had is to tell women stories, for the women in my family who didn't have a chance for the women in my family to talk about what happened to them. to talk about what happened to them. You know, they were silenced. My great grandmother, Mary Anderson, was removed and placed into care as a domestic. Well, not care. You can't call it care, but she was a domestic. I've made a lot of work for Mary and a lot of other women in her position. and a lot of other women This is one of five workhorses. This is one of five workhorses. They're very brutal works, talking about brutal history. Often indigenous women didn't just work through the day, Often indigenous women didn't they were used of a night as well. they were used of a night as well. A few years ago now, I wanted to move away from the dark female stories that I was telling about abuse, and I heard about Con Colleano, who was born in Lismore, and was a world-famous tightrope walker. He was an Aboriginal, but he never promoted that because it wasn't safe. That's quite similar to my story. My grandmother would always say, "Stay out of the sun. "Say you're Italian." In my exhibition, A Dickensian Sideshow, I was hoping to celebrate the Indigenous people in circuses, I was hoping to celebrate but I've also unpacked the dark side, but I've also unpacked the dark side, a truth that doesn't often get told in this country. Some of these golliwogs I'd been collecting... ..I kind of feel like I'm reclaiming and protecting these not-so-Kosher objects and giving them a story in a different context with my work. So I guess looking at the history of circus, it was hard not to look at the human zoos. These ones are kind of like how Indigenous women These ones are kind of like how Indigenous women were seen as prizes and trophies. I often feel like when opportunities come my way, it's a bit of a sign from the ancestors it's a bit of a sign that the story needs to be told. that the story needs to be told. That calling has been incredibly healing for me. That calling has been It's been really important, It's been really important, to shed any residue of intergenerational trauma, to shed any residue of my own trauma, my own trauma, and have a voice. My whole life is about being an artist. My whole life I'm a bowerbird. I'm a bowerbird. I'm looking for shiny things and pretty things. The PET bottles have an exquisite shine that I think is mesmerising. I don't take every bottle. I just want the ones that are beautiful to me. I do fight the impulse to just keep everything. My collection would be found, collected, given, My collection would be converted and stolen. converted and stolen. I was so obsessed with plastic. I love taking a container that is mass-produced and then giving it that love, that attention, that care. I want to make something beautiful out of it and bring out the best of what that form is. My art is a clumsy attempt to do what I think the vessel would like to have done to it. I really wanted to make art. It was just a compulsion. And going to art school, allowed that to blossom. I was making art. I was living on the dole. Garbage is ubiquitous. It's all around us. And this was the material that was available. Part of the work that I do in my practice Part of the work that is making what I want to own. is making what I want to own. And I made a car because I couldn't afford a car. So it was like in art, I can make a representation of what I desire. I'm interested in mimicry and making fakes and replicas. I'll put the blue willow pattern on found objects and all sorts of things. It's quite difficult to do 'cause it's very small, It's quite difficult to do but I like that challenge. but I like that challenge. The originators of willow pattern comes from Britain. It was like this fake story put onto this mass-produced China. I definitely have a sickness around objects, and I think my mother had that. When I was very little, she collected broken windscreen glass and she put it in a glass vase. She saw the beauty in that and I saw her enjoy that beauty. If I don't have it on display, I don't know it exists. If I don't have it on display, This is my rhinoceros collection. This is my rhinoceros collection. Cigarette-end papers, I'm still working with. Cigarette-end papers, My Mona Lisa, quite small collection. My Mona Lisa, quite small collection. Don't they look, precious? I don't actively go out buying sewing kits or anything, I don't actively go out they just sort of come to me. they just sort of come to me. When you look really hard, you realise that the faces When you look really hard, you realise that the faces are all based on one face, you realise that the faces but they're all a bit different. but they're all a bit different. These are printers' boxes, and you have to find things that fit into it. I'm not even a big fan of Mickey Mouse, I'm not even a big fan but it's like the hoarder in me. but it's like the hoarder in me. I'm like, "Yep, I'll take that." With my envelopes, when I get something sent to me, With my envelopes, I'd pull my name off, I'd pull my name off, because I didn't want my name going into the bin. Once you start collecting something and it grows, it looks really good. Each bottle has one way of going better than the others, Each bottle has one way where the paint has fallen, where the paint has fallen, so there's optimum viewing areas. And they look better in a bundle. I love when I display the works that people will identify. That's the Coca-Cola bottle or Dinamo liquid! So they feel a bit of themselves in the display. It's a signature almost of each person. Art is around us and beauty is around us. If you have the eyes to look at it. I really think the role of an artist is to mirror back the society that they live in. If I can encourage people to perhaps use a little less packaging, If I can encourage people to perhaps that's a great bonus. that's a great bonus. It's very interesting, the way materials come to me. It's a strange mixture between accepting what the universe gives you and then having intention and going out and finding things. And I love the power of things I find on the street. They have sort of a magnetic pull for me. I wish I could collect lots and lots of stuff, I wish I could collect but I try and focus my collections but I try and focus my collections to things that relate to music that will end up in artwork. Fly On The Wall is one of my favourite AC DC shirts, from 1985. When I was a teenager, should I have been so fortunate to have a band shirt, should I have been so fortunate I would treasure it I would treasure it and be really upset I would treasure it and be really upset if it got a little stain on it. And now, you know, I just buy them bulk with eBay and I cut out the As and the Cs and the Ds, obviously, and then sometimes I make my own letters and then they go off into the world and have their own lives. So essentially now I collect and let go. So, I grew up in Maitland in the Hunter Valley. I mean, the things I was interested in were music and art. And I used to go to Newcastle, catch the train to Newcastle when I was allowed to when I was older. This is from a Crowded House concert at the Civic Theatre or the Workers Club. That's Neil Finn. And then this is afterwards. That's me with the setlist. And then New FM came to Newcastle. And so that's where I heard AC/DC and all the kind of And so that's where I heard AC/DC and all the kind of Aussie rock'n'roll and all the kind of that I totally fell in love with. that I totally fell in love with. The thing I love about the album covers is they're all the same, but different. 'Cause they've all had a different life. And then when you put them all together, it's like a fabric quilt that's been stitched together. it's like a fabric quilt This one's really cool. This one's really cool. It's got the marks where someone's coloured in with texta It's got the marks where someone's coloured in with texta everywhere it got scuffed. someone's coloured in with texta And some of them are really cool And some of them are really cool 'cause they've got shopping lists or they smell like cigarettes. And you can really feel all the energy and all the parties that these albums have played alongside to. I think a lot of Australian artwork seeks to look international. But I think when we have our own vernacular, But I think when we it's more interesting. it's more interesting. That's why I wanted to remake the Long Way To The Top AC/DC film clip, because it's like a bona fide piece of Australian culture because it's like a bona fide piece and it's just as great as, you know, and it's just as great as, you know, a Russell Drysdale painting, to me. Boom! Take that, Drysdale. I've often said that I would have loved to have been a rock star, but at the same time I've got a leaning, or a predisposition to a monastic life and I would have loved to have been a nun. And so I think a studio life as an artist is this perfect balance between being extroverted and having exhibitions and having quiet, contemplative time where you get to be with yourself. Rock Gate is a Shinto shrine made out of Marshall amps. Shinto shrines traditionally mark the threshold between the profane world and the sacred world. When I go to concerts, I feel like I'm in that sacred world. You're just connected to something greater than yourself. These are some of my concert tickets. Yeah Yeah Yeahs, when I saw them in Paris. These are some of my concert tickets. Yeah Yeah Yeahs, when I saw them in Paris. AC/DC ticket. when I saw them in Paris. AC/DC ticket. Dolly Parton, absolute goddess. Dolly Parton, absolute goddess. Backstage passes to Cold Chisel Backstage passes to Cold Chisel when I was 16, I went to Japan Backstage passes to Cold Chisel when I was 16, I went to Japan on exchange for a couple of weeks and it was just absolutely life-changing, and just saw that there was this OTHER reality. Because of the history of Shintoism, they worship the spirit and energy of inanimate objects. And that's something that's really entered into my work. I like using symbols that already have a place in popular consciousness. You know what a smile means, or you know what a tear coming out of an eye means. When I was making The Wake, I was looking at haniwa, which are Japanese terracotta funerary spirits designed to guard the tombs of the deceased. And I made them after I lost a baby. And I made them And so, in a very real sense, And so, in a very real sense, they were these vessels that I could hold in my arms. And so they all had their own spirit and energy. One thing my Buddhist studies have really helped me with One thing my Buddhist studies is to be present to anything. is to be present to anything. You can have different relationships to what I would call more difficult states and find peace and maybe even joy within them. I like to harness the energy of anything that's offered to me. So whether it's an emotional state, a major life threshold, something that presents itself on the street, like a stool, I just try and let it all get processed in my art practice and then send them back out into the world in that flow. This is my dressing room and my wig room. Oh, that one's really disgusting. I don't wear these. I'm not that crazy. I don't wear these. This one's a find. This one's a find. It's a Raquel Welch original from her Raquel Welch wig line. Her wig is actually the best of all of them. She's like an evil queen. I've always collected - always - even as a kid. I guess you could say that other people's trash is my pleasure. I guess you could say that It's very rare that you find It's very rare that you find anything worthwhile It's very rare that you find anything worthwhile in op shops these days. But I'm always on the lookout for things that make me laugh But I'm always on the lookout or give me ideas. or give me ideas. The weirder, the better. Oh, my God, I don't remember what's in here. When I saw this thing, I'm like, "I'm going to rip that off," because I'm obsessed with tissue box holders. because I'm obsessed with I made this one over here. I made this one over here. This thing's a whoopee cushion that I made as a ring cushion for our wedding. My art practice is whatever takes my fancy, really. my main focus is embroidery and applique. This is Joan Crawford recovering from plastic surgery, as a quilt. These quilts were representations of my ideas of heaven, hell and purgatory. This is something really cool. Look at this thing. It's a nun. MAN: Oh, it is too. I thought was a sailor. Look at this thing. It's a nun. MAN: Oh, it is too. I thought was a sailor. Oh. But it's a nun. Oh. But it's a nun. No, it's a nun. Looks like she's dead. No, it's a nun. Looks like she's dead. No, it's a nun. The more amateur, the better. The more amateur, the better. This one's beautiful. They just look like little universes. See, there's room up here. Oh, my God. Look at that. It's beautiful. So the way I like to arrange my books is mainly in relation to each other - you know, Truman Capote will be up next to Gore Vidal you know, Truman Capote 'cause they were rivals, 'cause they were rivals, or he'll be next to Harper Lee because they were really good friends. The worst way that I've seen people display their books is colour-coded. How are you going to find that thing? It's so stupid. How are you going to find that thing? Anyway... Anyway... This is going to be tricky 'cause I've got to pull it out and the books are, like, mmm...really heavy. Young people probably don't even know who the hell Phyllis Diller is, Young people probably don't even but she's the queen of comedy. but she's the queen of comedy. What inspired me to make my own wig room, What inspired me 'cause she had a room 'cause she had a room And my favourite wig is this one here, which is like a frumpy housewife in curlers. This guy here is a taxidermied lizard that my bestie gave me. He needs cheering up because he looks really sad. He needs cheering up So I'm putting him in drag. So I'm putting him in drag. A lot of my obsessive making for sure had something to do with my upbringing. We came here in '84 as refugees from El Salvador. There was a civil war happening there and it was very brutal. My dad was very involved in the resistance. My parents sheltered us from a lot of things. So I was very, very shy and I just sort of stuck to myself. It definitely fostered that creativity I had in me. My way of dreaming was through having little things and treasures. I'm really also into president portraits, like this one here. It's JFK, but what I really love about him is that it looks nothing like him. but what I really love about him He looks like a bulldog. He looks like a bulldog. Amy Sedaris has this really great saying which I think of often, "Personality fee is that you give your bond over "Personality fee is that you give "and then you just kiss it goodbye, "and then you just kiss it goodbye, "and that means you can do whatever you like to the house "and that means you can do "and live the way you want to live." "and live the way you want to live." I think that's perfect. So this here is my wedding dress. And the monkey's wearing it now. I get to see it every day, hung up on this glamorous monkey. My dream dress was never white. It was always going to be a celebration dress and something really over-the-top and grand. We did the first song, 'cause we're, like, obsessed with karaoke. We did the first song, 'cause We killed it. We killed it. I think the next time I wear it will be in my casket when I'm dead. I think the next time I wear it (LAUGHS) (LAUGHS) (CORK POPS) Ooh! Are you making drinks? Yeah. Sexy lady. Cheers. My collecting is like an uncontrollable obsession My collecting is like that will never end. that will never end. I never stop thinking about it. It's like a relief, coming into this house and seeing all the beautiful things, coming into this house forgetting about the outside world. forgetting about the outside world. It's sort of a haven, for sure. Captions by Red Bee Media Copyright Australian Broadcasting Corporation
