Hey, I'd like to know if you need life insurance. - Who is this? - [Ned On Phone] Is this you, Mr. X? You know I used to sit next to you in music class. I played the trombone - No idea. - [Ned On Phone] just like you. Ned the Neddy, you don't remember? - Aw, sorta.

Well God is gonna give you seven days to learn your lesson. - Why would God do that? - [James On Phone] You're not a nice person, Mr. X. I guess what we're saying is, we're concerned about your life, Mr. X. Keep in mind, you can do whatever you want. Death, you'll just be reborn again on the next day. But remember, after seven days, your time is up. - I have to change my ways, huh? - [James On Phone] And remember, after seven days, God will judge your heart. Be ready, Mr. X. Be ready. - [Mr. X Voiceover] This is some crazy shit. I can't tell anyone this. They'll think I'm crazy. Maybe it was just a dream. Tonight I do a $100,000 drug deal. Only problem is, I don't have all the money needed to complete the deal. I got about 50,000, but still, I need another 50,000 by tonight.

It was getting too easy, the money was coming too fast. I'm still tryina figure out why they did PJ like that. Rest in peace, my guy. Just as fast as they here, now they gone. (birds tweeting) An associate of mine tipped me out to a $50,000 gold-plated engagement ring snatch-up. All I had to do was act like I was breaking into the house, and grabbed the ring located in the bathroom. Easy enough, right? Yeah, it would be a stolen fully insured ring that my associate would collect the insurance money, and I could pawn the ring off for 60,000.

Here's Matt Dundee, featuring Yuck Mouth, with "Rap Gang Lin, Dope Gang Boom." - [Mr. X] One thing I've learned in life, God can put us through some major life trials. Hm. We have to find a better way to solve our problems. (phone ringing) We gotta start loving ourselves, before God can love us. But most importantly, man I gotta find another way. That's for sure. Wait a minute, that gives me an idea. Make sure you buy that powerball ticket today. (distorted electronic and rap music) The year is 1999. And they told me, it could take seven years to get there. It was the deal that NASA didn't do, they're finally coming. The world rising. This is so messed up. 1999, they say the world's gonna end at midnight. They won't be able to see the whole world. So essentially, they can be back. It's a slow death. (Voice becomes too distorted and drowned out by music) Just become another slave planet, on Mars. They told me to sleep as much as I can. And don't use too much energy. They launched the pod via fusion. And I was amazed. The oxygen is recycled. Imagine that. Amazing what you can do with aluminum foil. But the biggest problem was weight, because once you launch into space, everything is weightless. But how could they supply me with enough food and water? Hm, emergency. Just add water to the food. It was light and easy. I wasn't really expending energy. So I could make the food last longer. How do I poop? Very carefully. And sometimes the pooper gets full. Release the carpin. As far as floating around like an astronaut, they fixed that, there's artificial gravity. Other than that, it's a enjoy the ride kind of thing. They tell me to keep a daily video journal. Speaking of that, where are they? Who is that, right? No one knows. But they all fact like they do. (sighs) It was a hard pill to swallow. You know, to accept the life sentence in prison. I don't like to talk about it much. But I do have company with me. Well, it's a smartphone and commander. It's guiding me the ways to Mars. When I get there if I do, I'm supposed to leave Morse code on the planet. I guess that's how they know I've landed and it's possible. I don't really trust that it's just a test mission. And there's nothing of value on Mars. There has to be some kind of resource on Mars for humans. I know I shouldn't have done what I did. I read most of my days in prison. Anything I could get my hands on. I was a sponge for knowledge. She didn't deserve what she got. My wife, well, ex-wife. She wanted nothing more than to have a family of kids. I just couldn't provide her with that. Crime and punishment. On Earth, it's simple. You do the crime, you do the time. Yeah, they say Mars, you can't live on it 'cause of the temperatures being so cold. But I do wonder. I wonder about the idea, of some sun reflectors. Pure. Look at ways to reflect sun on the planet Mars. Was it was real anyways? Life, love? All that and a bag of chips. After the third month out here, I pretty much just gave up on it. Horrible idea actually. Shave even, trimming less so. I mean what was the point? Look good for myself? Naw. Naw. I don't know. It's a hard pill to swallow. You know that you're about to die in a few hours. But at least you're not gonna die without purpose. I mean you'll die with a struggle, tryin' to stay alive, how to figure out a new way. (sighs) I don't know. It's still a rough card to be dealt. It's like how it swings on this one. I could just get a couple of hours of sleep. 47 hours of sleep. This cannot be happening right now. Stay calm, stay calm. You got this. Stop. (suspenseful electronic music)
