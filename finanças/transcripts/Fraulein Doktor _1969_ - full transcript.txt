FRAULEIN DOCTOR They are there... calm down boy Stay where you are! Stay where you are! Do not move! The third one is probably there, the dogs found it. Take ten men and bring him! You. come with me! Come on, search, search! This, here, look. Look at this, Mr Lieutenant... your pants He's changed his clothes. Yes, he's a crafty fellow. It could be disguised as anything. Bring him over and we'll report to the colonel. SCOTLAND Alright gentlemen. We knew when they were coming, and when they were going... but we don't know why... We are a bridge team. We came to play bridge... And the third man, what was he for? Was it a reserve? If one of us catches a cold... he takes over. And if they both catch a cold? Ah...he is a very good player and he can play for both of us... Now Shell, once again, why have you come here? To serve our country. Germany will gain nothing if England he puts them against a wall and shoots them as spies As an example for other German "tourists". We are brothers and it would not be a bad example Do you know Meyer? We play a very unique role here. Ten men on one side and one man on the other... It's not very sporty. Not much It's called the wall game. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name... Squad... Halt! ...so it will be on earth as it is in heaven... A cigarette? ...and forgive our debts, just as we forgive our... and lead us not into temptation and deliver us from all evil... wrong... amen forgive them sir. Amen! Right, right! Front row, knee to the ground! Squad... Charge! Aim! Live Germany! ¡Fuego! Go see! Meyer... You'll talk to save yourself from going to that wall tomorrow morning. So Mr. Colonel, will all the rifles be loaded with blanks? Exactly sergeant, and no one should know it, not even the officer in charge, just you and me. Not even the pastor, sir? The pastor will read your prayer as usual. Is it clear? Yes sir! Continue... Good evening. Right, right! Front row, knee to the ground! Squad... Charge! Have mercy on me, oh Lord! Wash away my sins with great love of mercy. Wash me away my wickedness, and cleanse me of my sin. Aim! Is a woman! Don't shoot! Do not shoot Weapons to the shoulder! Here you go. What was your mission? Matar a Kitchener. That? Assassinate Marshal Kitchener? Shooting guard! It was not a decent time to die. The eyebrows a little smaller. I would certainly like to meet this girl. His main feature is his hair, vividly red. Scapa Flow is a war zone keep your passes handy! Now this Kitchener assassination plan. I told him I don't know anything. Meyer...all the rifles in the platoon were loaded with blanks. You've been a poor fool A simple trick was enough to make you betray your country. I know British military laws, Colonel. You have no authority to execute a spy without a civil trial. You are right, in civil law. Say goodbye to your friend. He will have the trial in London. Schell, I'm sorry for the trick I played on you. I admire your courage, you are a brave man You have put his spirit before his body. And you, Mr., put intelligence before the soul. I despise them both. What do you want now? A revolver with a single bullet? Not commit suicide, Colonel. I'm just a poor man. Oh I understand! Let's start from the beginning, will you? This plot to assassinate Kitchener? How will it be done?... With a rifle?... With a bomb? On the street? Or at the Scapa Flow pier? Are you alone, honey? You. will you receive visitors? ...men? Why do you ask? Room number seven. And no sailors. He didn't wash the sheets with sailors' filth... That watch shop, on the other block. What time does it open? I do not have a watch. I have never used your services. - And the luggage? - Will come tomorrow There is still nothing of the "Clockmaker" Colonel Mathesius, it's Aberdeen from Hamburg... "Agents Meyer and Schell, you have been arrested. of "Doktor" there is no news." "Schell executed. Meyer spoke. Stop" Keep calling the Watchmaker! The submarine is now in great danger. Cancel the operation. Allow me, General Metzler. If you let Lord Kitchener go to Russia and help raise the demoralized armies of the tsar. Germany will have a new threat from the east. And we will compromise the actions of Lenin, whom we have elected in Russia... to unleash the revolution. How will the Kitchener murder be possible now? It's possible, because I put our best agent on the Kitchener mission. and she is an amazing actress. Actress? Sir, have you sent a woman to Scapa Flow? - And why not? She has more imagination, precision and courage that any man, in any situation She only has two weak points, humanity and is somewhat addicted to morphine Do you trust a morphine addict? Not yet a slave to morphine... Who is this woman? She gave you the poison gas. It will give me the way to kill Kitchener What are we going to see? Human corpses floating in the water, like a new "floating mine" Just seven miles from Scapa Flow, the world's most dangerous waters. She took the bodies from a hospital morgue. leaving them where they have the opportunity to continue serving their country, revealing the course of the currents the English press took the story and turned it their way, as Fraulein Doktor predicted ...and told them where and when the mysterious corpses appeared... and several days, the front pages of the newspapers put: "Mutiny and massacre on German warship". That's this woman! Enough! Now that we've been able to calculate ocean currents... It only remains to know the time, the day and the ship in which Kitchener will travel. Surely, your Fraulein Doktor will give us details of the ship and the date and time. If Meyer "sang" everything, it's very likely that Fraulein Doktor will be arrested in Scapa Flow But Meyer knew nothing of the "watchmaker" CERRADO Private Entrance WATCHMAKER "I have served Germany for 20 years. I can't go on any longer..." "...But you will not hang me because I will do you that courtesy..." I bring things from Hampshire. Show me your ID card. What's wrong with you dear? I wait for my boy he's with Kitchener You will never be able to see it, HMS "Hampshire" is heavily guarded. Laundry for the Hampshire, it's for the officers. Yes I know. MACPERSON LAUNDRY UP TO DATE Well, we know the color of her hair and the color of her eyes. and the exact measurement of his feet. That's not enough... Come on! oh Who doesn't have a job, huh? Well, let's see, don't despair, you'll wait at least two weeks. I have to attend to the navy. - Can't it be faster? My boyfriend is a sailor on the ship Hampshire. The Hampshire sails this week, you know. Look, what do I care? Everyone wants their clothes washed and back on the same day. Miss, let me help you wait for me outside... Wait a minute. What is your room? There's no need. And what do you care? Are you a policeman? Yes I am. Give me the three shillings - I don't care about that... What's your name? Do not do that! Let's talk first, I speak better when my head is unloaded. My boyfriend can come He doesn't come, no. Hey! Let me do it, you'll break it for me. Don't worry, I'll make you a nice present. Do you want this dress? I will say that it disappeared when they washed it You are so sweet. I am your land man and he is from the sea. The movement of the port is assured... You won't think I'm too easy! No, I like you. Call the colonel, tell him that the measurement is exactly the same... Well, I don't know anything...! I can't get it off my mind Think about what you want, but don't talk. Well anyway, I like to misbehave... ¡So!, ¡So! She's got a maid's suitcase in a duchess's dress, she's a complicated woman Mrs. tell us everything this woman told you from the moment you entered this house. He said he needed to fix his watch and he asked me when the watch shop here opened. You are truly extraordinary... What time will we meet? At 10.30? I have another meeting in the evening. You won't go... cancel it and you'll see me. He will go ashore. For three days I have been bringing clean and dirty clothes to and from HMS Hampshire. Can't you see? My last delivery is at four o'clock It doesn't take a genius to understand that... the Hampshire will set sail at 19 o'clock...with the tide Do you know who is on board? TRUE? He's no king, but he's bigger... he's Kitchener. Oh, come on! Do you know where I would have sent him if I were the king? Are you sure they'll be out today? Yes, sure. The laundry knows more than the coast guards. Take him downstairs. Morphine... Sirs, this is a very important matter, this woman must be stopped as soon as possible. She has a black skirt, black shoes and a black woolen shawl. She wears a pink shirt and black shoes, and a black woolen shawl. It's the sign we've been waiting for. It's her. Let's go pick it up. Welcome to Germany Fraulein Doktor At 19:00 sharp on HMS "Hampshire," Kitchener will be on board I am very concerned Lord Kitchener, Please reconsider your decision please postpone the trip, we will have bad weather tonight The intelligence service reported that there are alarming news that they are about to make an attempt on his life in Scapa Flow. We'll stay below the surface of the eastern channel at 19:55 we will drop a series of the first mines, then we'll add six more every two minutes. They will be in the Hampshire area between 8:35 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. We intercepted the same message, Captain Munster. "The Admiralty routinely searches for mines. The eastern channel is cleared of mines." Weird... a routine message repeated three times? Repeated to fool us. The "Hampshire" will not pass through the eastern channel They use the west channel only for the ferries going to the islands. What is our position now? We must follow the original plan! And place the mines in an empty water field? No! If he "Hampshire" does not come to us we must go to "Hampshire". The sea gets rough, we may need the devil's help, if we go there we will consume 4 h. made out of fuel. Do it captain! deal with the devil The Hampshire is going to be on the west channel Maximum speed Course 800 I would have preferred Kitchener not to be on board. You didn't listen to my advice Me neither. He said he won't be intimidated by a woman Come on, we can't do anything else! Fifth tanda! Sixth tanda! Smoke is seen at 32 degrees south at Marwick Head It's HMS "Hampshire" - When will she be over the mine? In a few minutes... Course? 4° north-northwest. The target's speed is 20 knots and continues to increase. The one of the wind is 27. Allow me, I must observe the target. 15 meters below. It's over the mines now. No! I refuse to believe it! Explosion in the boiler room Caused by a storm at sea? An excuse for a national disaster. I don't agree with any of this! In that ship 700 men drowned, But one of them was killed! Kitchener was my responsibility. I am the real responsible! And you too Meyer! Because you spoke too late. If you had spoken an hour earlier, he might still be alive...! Now you will tell me everything you know about that woman. How do you sit, how you walk, strengths and weaknesses? All! And that morphine capsule? What does it mean? Morphine? What morphine? I don't know anything about morphine... Need a better description. look it up So you son of a bitch lied to me! Look Colonel, you have two options. Hang me or pay me in gold! If you pay, I'll tell you everything you want to know. I have to find that woman And I'm going to do it even if it takes the rest of my life. If you want money, it will be paid But don't forget if you betray me your life is in my hands. Excuse me colonel. Do you have a cigarette, by any chance? Thank you thank you very much! Do you know the formula for the new French poison gas? That? Do you mean that she was that servant in Dr. Saforet's house? Yeah In experiment #70, the rats were alive for three minutes, and the dogs five I'm going to keep experimenting on a new combination... ...with the same elements. Breakfast, Jeanette! That's all for now, Mathilde. Good morning, ma'am. Clean it again Jeanette - I'm sorry, ma'am. Please bring another. - Yes ma'am O Jeanette. What are you doing? Dusting, ma'am. what a wonderful fire I'm so exhausted Jeanette, could you take my boots off? Oh, of course! Gracias. This is wonderful... Tell me, did someone brush your hair? - No ma'am Let me do it No, ma'am! Yeah. Jeanette. When did you...? When did you first have...? When she was sixteen years old, Mrs. I can't believe it...it's mine! Yes, It's yours Why is he so sweet to me? - Because I like you Can? Sure We will be friends... very friends... I'm sorry I didn't want to wake you... lie down with me Why do you do that horrible job? Do you want the Germans to conquer Paris, my dear? How did you start? used to make perfumes before the war. Perfumes are better than gases You cannot understand that I must protect France... Let me show you what I do in the lab... ...then you will understand. Good morning, ma'am. Good morning Can we start And now the gas. Add the new ingredient, the 100 cubic cm look at those rats they collapsed at 43 seconds they are finished... The dogs dance until 47 seconds. I have been successful. Gas burns the skin and gas masks won't do any good ¡Jeanette! What happens? Keep calm Please What are you going to do when you finish your formula? You will see. I did wrong, I was wrong when I showed it to you. I'm sorry. I don't want to see everything you do It's so horrible! Jeanette, don't you understand? after 3 years of work, I was finally able to get the formula. I'm sorry. I'm sorry Do you want to go back to sleep? I still have to work, I'll be back soon. And so, the formula ended in Germany. The gas was so dangerous that neither party used it. Not yet... Meyer you will go find Fräulein Doktor. And it will kill her! kill her? Mathesius will never believe that I could escape from here. that problem... leave it to me. More chloroform. The bullet went through - No Dr., please wait Do not give any medicine. Brutality is not part of the treatment methods. If he touches that wound, this man will certainly die. You are not going to be "captured", my friend fled on the beach... ...although wounded, so he couldn't complete his mission Lieutenant Rommer. The Homeland is proud and for me, it is an honor Sergeant, we are very grateful. This will always remind you, what your father was... Do I have to decorate this woman? I believe protocol requires it so, Mr. I must admit Fraulein that your bravery deserves to be recognized. but Lord Kitchener was a friend of mine, so I can't be happy about his death. and I can't give you my congratulations... My conscience prevents me May I know why you made me come, Colonel? To teach you a new way to kill You don't know German counterintelligence, we have nothing to learn Fortunately, you found your spirit, that will help you Morphine, some irresponsible doctors prescribe it as a pain reliever. It is for pain that kills and allows the patient to sleep. I, who am a conscientious doctor, invented a formula So that, when the substance is consumed in liquid form... a morphine addict falls asleep... forever Works great mixed with champagne Meyer. What will happen to me? The heart beats slower, but does not stop. Come on man drink now, you must know what you are going to feel... Is it good French? - Try it Oh my God! If you had morphine in your system, you would die in an hour. It's worrying. He only has to worry that Fräulein Doktor and this poison are together. BERLIN A magnificent fugue, Meyer. Tell me again, when did you get your wound? Excuse me sir. I prefer not to talk about it, remembering it is too painful for me. what courage my brave And Schell... did he die bravely? No sir, I told you that Schell fought valiantly... on the beach. Sure, Schell ended up against a wall. Obviously after having spoken. Schell spoke? According to our records, someone spoke. Really? Franz. Look up our man's report in British intelligence. Yes sir. Thank you, colonel. Congratulations Colonel and my compliments for the efficiency of the organization How else could I return...? I'm in your command - Thank you, Meyer. Your first duty will be to follow Colonel Foreman's instructions... You. do you want me to kill her? The morphine has rendered her completely useless to us... You will invite Fräulein Doktor to dinner and you will offer him champagne The sinking of HMS Hampshire has made you more beautiful. So you think? We are leaving now? Thank you Frieda, good evening. - Good evening, Mrs. Aim, fire! They are war heroes will fall at their posts We are the villains and we die ingloriously. Yet we live better - Let's celebrate for that life Your champagne sir... It is a very rare vintage - Thank you. The grapes for this wine will no longer grow again. Our cannons have destroyed their roots and our gas has burned their leaves. We made this wine something very, very rare. you were kind to ask Tell me your name... "Miss Doctor." I don't deserve your trust? It's a lovely place, isn't it? I know you think I'm corrupt. But you, however, have gone further than anyone bringing new and terrible weapons. It is my duty for love of my country. But now we know that it has consumed you And you know it too. What do you mean by that? - Because I've been watching you... And I have seen a terrible loneliness And what is more important, You couldn't pretend with me. You have made your imagination fly. - You know it's not true Because I have seen your loneliness And that's why I love you. I love you, you must believe me - Nobody can love me... What prevents you from leaving this job? Please, please come with me now. We have no obligation We can go to Switzerland immediately. Then I would be responsible for you making me a coward You must finish your work... Come on, pour me some of your champagne. He toasted to you... and I thank you. If you forgive me... I feel a little dizzy... I forgot my wallet... Cover your face! Patriotism is always well rewarded. ...earth to earth, and ashes to their ashes Jesus Christ, our Savior, will call us on the last day... Fräulein Doktor is buried. Now go to London and collect them... "For the German Intelligence Center Meyer returned to England..." "It is imperative to follow their movements and report" Mathesius. Welcome Lady. Here is a replica of the entrance to the Belgian HQ These figures represent the men who are always on guard... Everything is reproduced exactly to real scale. A Sergeant Major... Here are the messengers... Current photographs of the castle three sentinels This is General Peronne's office British and French counter-intelligence have believed in his death. then they won't look for her and she can work freely again... Where are the volunteers? Bring them in! We have selected nine, they all speak French and Flemish I'm afraid you sound too German boy, I'm sorry Thanks, Lieutenant. walk to the window please... It is almost imperceptible but the Belgians have a particular way of walking. I'm sorry. We only need four. You all have a spirit of courage and patriotism. A team of doctors awaits you downstairs ...with orders to prepare their corpses for a certain use Who keeps volunteering? You guys can go Yes, you can go, you're fired Your name - Lieutenant Hans Ruppert Tenant Ernst Wiechert. Tenant Wilhelm von Oberdorf. Lieutenant Otto Latemar. Lieutenant Oberdoff, why didn't you volunteer? I didn't volunteer, because it would be stupid. if I offered to die blindly, without knowing why, ...it would be absurd and meaningless. And you Lieutenant? I asked myself, what use are corpses, that they speak flamenco...? Please sit down! On the 21st of next month, General Ludendorff the biggest offensive of the war is about to start... ...to break the enemies before the new American Army arrives On the 2nd day of the offensive his duty is to infiltrate at the Belgian General Headquarters, wearing Belgian uniforms One of you will enter this room, he will open the safe, find and copy the documents he finds: Western front defense plans Fräulein Doktor will keep General Péronne in your room for 20 minutes. 20 minutes that should be used to the maximum And that can cost them their lives, which, you have generously offered. Meanwhile, they will learn to walk in this house blindfolded. Count your money. I don't doubt English honesty Did you see his face? I saw her dead in a bed, covered by a sheet They uncovered him, and I saw his dead face. But you should have tried to see her in her coffin. Look Colonel, all the French, Germans and Belgians they know that Fraulein Doktor is dead. Yes, but here is... there is something that is not clear. Or is it too light, I'm not sure what it is... I saw her dead in the morgue. She wasn't breathing and she wasn't moving... Dead. I want you to inform me of each initiative, project, sign or suspicion of what German intelligence is doing in Europe. Nothing, however insignificant it may seem, should... Wait a minute, Mayer! I want to see that all the diplomatic reports be intercepted... day and night. ¿Me explained well? MADRID Your Excellency, it is a great pleasure to represent my country, Chile. ...he was introduced by an esteemed citizen Mrs. Lucía de Velasco. Doña Lucía...the Belgian ambassador. Thank you Mr Ambassador. Welcome to Madrid, Mrs. Lucia You have been extraordinarily kind to donate a train to Belgium for the Red Cross And offer to manage it - It's a pleasure... Doña Lucia the Spanish director of the Red Cross, the Duke of Castile... excuse me Come my dear, I will introduce you to the women who will go with you. First our beloved Marquesa de Vado, who was in charge of training the staff. I'm sure we'll understand each other, Mrs. Lucia. Thank you marquise... Doña Elena de Rivas who has a medical degree. Doña Lucia for the first time I will give it an appropriate use and we are very grateful for it Charming young lady! - Yes it is. Ladies Julia de Alvareda and Clara de Castillo. I met his cousin Felice, the photos he has don't do the original justice... It's very kind of you to say that. General Peronne has telegraphed and will personally thank you for your generosity It would be an honor to meet you Ambassador, I will welcome you when you visit us. A clue, just a little clue, is what I'm groping in the wind for. But what will it mean? - What should it mean? A large sum of money has been transferred from Berlin to Zurich, via Madrid. They are going to buy Spanish onions. Colonel Mathesius signed the order Stewart, get me three travel tickets. To Spain, sir? No no.. It is a neutral country I have no power, better go to France, near the border. It's 9.05, Mrs. Lucia, you told me to remind you, thank you. You can go. I'll be with you in a moment. We lost Lieutenant Latemar. Thank you ladies, you have progressed very well in your practices Now Doña Elena will teach you the use of morphine Morphine may be the only merciful thing they can give As you will see, there will be no clean deaths like the ones you know in hospitals The horrors of war are hard to imagine, the screams of pain. They will bring you men with destroyed bodies and you will only be able to give them this. According to you, none of those women on board the train are under suspicion. We will investigate the families of each one: - Marquesa de Vara, Rivas, Lara, Velasco, Castilla, Alvareda. Each name is from noble families of Spain...

We have stopped the Germans! You'll be home soon. He will, in fact, be home soon... Ah, Dona Lucia! - Welcome, General. O marquise. Even on such a dark day, there is a ray of sun that illuminates it I can't deny that these are gloomy days. Germans are everywhere and if they are lucky enough to have the wind turn, they will use gas. They have a lot. Once them, once us. Ah!... the flowers of Spain, oh! It's a pity I can't stay. General Peronne, it is very nice of you to visit us here. Would you like to have a glass of wine with us, General? Here... Oh, just a minute, Doña Lucia - Thank you. They say the wind will calm down I smell the bad smell of gas. Are we going to be safe from the gas? Chilean wine, excellence!

Let's continue the inspection, General. The sound of the cannons tells me that I have to go, Lucia You. wanted to talk to me lieutenant? My Company Chief told me that he will stop by and give you his regards, Mr. Captain Leopold Perrier. How is my friend's leg? come on You're leaving the hospital next week, Mr. I am happy.

The Americans! Now the Germans will have real difficulties. Let's hope this is the end of the war. Is this American aid? They're very few. They are just the first. All of America is behind them. We and the Germans are all tired fighters. But they just started Attention! They don't shoot. It's Ruppert. God help them, we can't. It's time to go...

Meyer, come on face her... no it's not her Take a good look at her face, and this time make sure she's not dead. This is ridiculous, you paid me, and I killed her. He's crazy, there's no point in him continuing to lie. Fraulein Doctor. You will go to England arrested in my custody. You will be taken to court. If found guilty, Do you know the punishment that awaits you? You are wrong, I am not going to follow you I'm sorry, but you are a German agent and you will come with me. High! High! No! No! Miss Doctor. His Excellency, General von Ludendorff wishes to congratulate you personally. Fin
