Are you tired? You promised me, Dad. You'd help me to do my homework. Otherwise, my teacher will scold me. Are you listening to me? Dad. Dad. Dad? One, two, three... That's not cool, Dad. I told you. I'll be right where you are on the count to three. One, two, three. I can go to school tomorrow, right, Dad? Not yet. The doctor said that you need to stay at home for a few days more for observation. If so, I'll fall behind. Semester exams are coming. It's okay. I'll borrow your friends' notes. You can catch up. You promised! If I fail this time, it's on you. I know. I promise. Now close your eyes. Okay. - Happy birthday, Sweetie. - Thank you, Daddy. Yes, Nam? Hurry, go back to the factory. Something's up. Faster. What makes you so slow? Wait, hold up! - Phuong, they're damaging our mats. - All you need to do is bring them outside. - Why are you guys so slow? - Oh, my God, the mats! - I failed to stop them. - Hey, over here. Hey. - Mrs. Tu! - What? The resort corporation ordered these mats months ago. They just haven't picked them up yet. Once they complete their purchase, I'll pay you back right away. - I promise. - I'm a grown-up. I am no kid for you to fool. Who would go to a resort to sleep on a mat? They aren't for sleeping. They'll use them to decorate the ceilings or walls. Mrs. Tu, please take pity on me. Please wait until the end of this month. If I can't make it, you can do whatever you want. Please give me one last chance. Mrs. Tu. I'm begging you. Okay. I'll give you one last chance. But keep your word and stop getting on my nerves. - Yes, ma'am. - Quit it, you guys. Return those mats and leave. What should we do now, Phuong? Tell our people to bring the mats inside - in case of rain. - Yes. Dad, fire! Fire! Fire! It's out! It's out! Nam is the only smoker here. How many times did I remind you that you should go outside to smoke? Can't you see how flammable this place is? I'm sorry, Phuong. The landlady scared the life out of me, so I forgot this. I promise it won't happen again. I asked you to call our friends to help with my wife's death anniversary. How was it? I'm sorry, Phuong. Hey, An. Can you come over at lunchtime to help me with the death anniversary? Shoot! I lost track of time. Please tell others to come early, too. I know. I got you. MAT-WEAVING VILLAGE, SEDGE-DYEING VILLAGE - You've finished early today, huh? - I have a death anniversary to attend. What are you staring at, you lout? Every single time! You always get an eyeful. They're right in front of my eyes. How can I avoid them? Try to wear them backward next time. What's up? Don't tell me that you want to borrow my money again. Is money everything to you? Today is Phuong's wife's death anniversary. He asked me to help him. Then why aren't you there already? I've just come back home. See? Gotta wash myself first. Hey! Dang! Your wife's looking sharp, bro. Stop bullshitting. Hurry up. Why did you come home so early? I need to attend Phuong's wife's death anniversary. Sorry, honey. Hi, sisters. Another new item. This is a work skirt. It's 200,000 VND. Anyone who orders up to two items today will get free shipping. Now, I have to end this livestream. My hubby is home early. So I have to cook for him. Message me if you'd like to order something. Bye-bye. Thanks so much, y'all. Honey, do you have time today? I need a ride to the hospital. What? What happened to you, love? Prenatal check-up. - What? - I'm pregnant. Prenatal check-up? You're pregnant? You're full of soap. Don't come near me. It doesn't matter! You're pregnant! Am I going to be a dad? Hey! This skirt is sold. Don't. Who cares? I'll buy it! I'm going to be a dad! I'm going to be a dad! Wait for me. I'll finish showering, go to the death anniversary, I'll take you for prenatal check-up. I'm going to be a dad! Mom, Dad, I'm home. Why are you home so early today? I have some errands to run today. Dad, why don't you try these herbs? I got it from a new apothecary. Another new place? But my back pain didn't ease up at all. Dad, if you want to get rid of it, you have to take a break. Nothing helps if you work like this every day. I've already told you. Automatic factories are down to their last cent. You're still working nonstop. If we hadn't done it, how could we raise someone like you? Go wash yourself, then we'll have lunch. - Come on. - Beat it. Hello? - Make sure you drop by Phuong's house. - All right. Okay. - Why don't you try your luck today? - I'm dead broke. - You're always broke! - Don't mess around. Only 20 million VND left. Let me bring you tomorrow. - Take off your ring. - Let me call my wife. She'll bring money straight away. - No, I want it now. - It's quick. Chill, bro. I'll pay later. Look, she is calling me. - Hurry up. I'll go weigh the chickens. - All right. Give me a sec. Hello? Why do you keep giving me surprises, Loc? Enough is enough. You even take my tontine now? You troublemaker scum, Loc. Oh, please, it's for the death anniversary. Whose? Your grandad? You go to a hundred death anniversaries a week, everyone here must have died. Keep it down. You give me a bad name. You still have a name? I'll trash your party. Come home now! Hello? Bring me the money quickly. Hurry. They're waiting. Hey, he's making off! Hey! - Hey! - Hey! You fatso! - Eat this! - Ouch! - Fatso! - Ouch! Oh, shit! It hurts. He's not going to stop. Why do you keep telling him to stop? Have a drink. If they refuse to sell the house next to yours, I'll handle them. Khanh, help me. I saw a guy just stopped here. Where is he? To whom are you asking? I'm asking you! Where are you hiding him? Help... Help! Help... Help... Help! Help! What're you looking at? Didn't your mother teach you how to behave at someone's house? Hello. I'm at the market. Where is it? Yeah. I'm with Big Boy. Right away? Okay. Hey! I won't let this slide. Let's resume, shall we? If you wish to expand your site, open a smithy first. Keep slamming it day by day, your old neighbors will have no choice but to settle it with a small price. - I like your method. Okay. - Let's do it. - Thank you. Okay. - Thank you, mister. Yes. Why haven't you left? - I'm afraid they're still around. - Why did you still gamble? Go wash yourself, then get going to Phuong's. Yes. Gosh, I thought I was the first to come. But Loan even got here before me. He is only by himself. And I live next door. I just want to give him a hand. How can Phuong hold his ground against someone as capable as you? By the way, why don't you take this chance to light an incense and ask Ly for a blessing? She must have known by now. Why do you two still keep it a secret? Then you can make an announcement to both families. - Am I right, Mrs. Bay? - Truly. Happy birthday, happy birthday Happy birthday to you Yeah. Have a wish. - Okay. Blow out the candles. - That's right. - Happy birthday, sweetheart. - Yes, Dad. - Please enjoy yourselves. - Thank you. Hi! - Dig in, you guys! - Thank you very much. - Cheers! - Cheers! I didn't say it because I sell insurance. That is my sincere advice, man. Having an insurance is beneficial. Just like me, I've bought one. If one day I end up losing my ability to work, my wife will get my insurance money. I can't even put bread on the table, let alone insurance. I mean it, man. Buy one. If you die, your wife will cash out billions. - Watch your mouth. - I'm here. - Let's drink. - Cheers! Phuong, how's business these days? Just so-so. See? It's good that we decided to quit early. Or else, we'd be famished. No one's in mat business these days. You're talking like it's nothing. As if switching careers will make you rich easily. Our folks are still making mats. Without markets, how can they keep going? Let's leave it aside. - Hey, cheers. - Cheers I still have to thank you for the time we worked together. - Is anyone up for iced tea? - Here. - I'll have some. - Please buy me a lottery ticket. Jeez, go away. Can't you see we're partying? Hey, hey. Why do you sell lottery tickets instead of going to school? Move along, kids. We're drinking here. You two, come here. I'll buy for you. You're already out on the street to make a living at this age. How is today? Is it good? No, sir. It sucked. Slow day, eh? All right, I'll buy you 20 tickets. Hey, count for her. - I'll do it! - Thank you, sir. Girls, make sure to tell Ut to feed you properly. - You two are too skinny. - Yes, sir. - Here you go. - Thank you, sir. Good luck to you. Wonderful. - Here, two for each of you. - Thank you. I simply bought them just for luck. - Usually, I'd buy a whole stack every day. - Okay, thank you. I also have something for you guys. How can we split one ticket? This is VNP's digital lottery. One ticket can grant you several billion, even hundreds of billions. - Really? - If I'm lucky, I'll make you guys have a new life. Jeez, that's great! Take a good look. These numbers are your birthdays. See? That line looks great. How can you remember all of our birthdays? He used to be our boss. He paid us. Of course, he'd remember. Right. Question, guys. Whose birthday is the 10th? King of the sea? - Bingo. - 16th... Gotta be me. The Cock God. 18th. - Me. - You're the king of perverts. 20th. The real estate tycoon. Number 9. The insurance boss. King of insurance. And the 28th? The Mat Father. The final boss. His memory is nearly as sharp as Phuong's. Clearly. But he forgets his debts. - Clearly. - Clearly. Hey, you're about to keep it? What if you spend it all on cockfighting after winning? - Come on. Cheers. - Cheers. Hey, friends As time flies Bittersweet memories still linger And we're undoubtedly together Side by side, we have no fear Hey, friends, no need to hide I'll always be here To share your ups and downs No matter where our lives take us Always in our hearts You and I are friends forever We sing better and better every time. Clearly. Phuong. The bracelet looks nice. Where did you buy it? I wear it for feng shui. It costs nothing. I can give it to you. No. My wife loves earrings with marbles. But I don't know where to buy them. Ah, I see. I'll buy you a pair this afternoon. I feel for An, you know. He works his ass off day by day, yet his wife acts all slutty at home. - That stings! - How would you know? - What're you talking about? - How wouldn't I? In her livestream the other day, she was like, "Hi guys, check out my new line of lightening cream. Take a look." - That's airing your dirty laundry. - Why did you keep watching if you hate it? He even has a Top Fan badge. My wife and I give our all so we could purchase a small property. We can't be adrift on a boat forever. Anyway, I'll leave after this shot. It's just a joke. Why are you so serious, An? No. I have to take my wife to a prenatal check-up. - What? - Holy cow! - Prenatal check-up? - You're going to have a baby? - Wonderful! - Wonderful! Dang! Congratulations. Are you sure it's yours? Hey! You should talk less to be less impolite. - Let's cheer. Then allow me to leave. - Okay. - Good news. - Congrats. Congrats. - Have fun, you guys. - Hey, jeez. You can do a prenatal check-up any day. I promised her. I'll be busy in the next few days. I might not be able to go. Three shots for coming, - seven for leaving. - That's the rule. - How can he ride if he's wasted? - Then don't leave. Exactly. - Okay. Seven shots, right? - Yup. - One. - One. That's two. Three. You rock. Four. Five. And six. - Six. - An. Last shot. The last shot. The seventh. I'll take it. Phuong. What's with you? Why are you still forcing him when he's this drunk? That was six. He can't see straight anymore. He can't see straight anymore. - You can't drink. - Clearly. Only one more left. Easy-peasy. - Last one. - Cheers! - That's cool. - Have fun, y'all. Don't worry, Phuong. It's nothing. Walk him out. - Stand straight. - Bye-bye. Tell your wife I said hi. It's okay, Phuong. I'm good. - Whose scooter is blocking the way? - That's Loc's. Stay there. Back to the Delta, the mother riverland... I'm off. Let me give you a ride. That's all right. It's okay. Go inside and have fun with them. I'm off. - Be careful. - I know. Let me tell you About the red, green, purple, and yellow... Oh, about the sedge mat craft That has rooted the people here For hundreds of years, by the Hau River, Despite the hardship They are determined To preserve their traditions Even when their breath is fading I still smile Lying on their mothers' mats Woo. That's good. Hello? What? - What? - An crashed into a truck! - What? - How is he? Where is he? - In the hospital. - Let's go. - They got him to the hospital. - Phat, wait for me. Take a taxi! Do you want to die? It's a scooter crash! Hey, how's An? We're sorry. Why do you keep asking him to drink? He comes home wasted every time. Are you satisfied now? Well, today is Phuong's wife's death anniversary. I don't care whose anniversary it is! You always have excuses. If not a wedding, then a death anniversary or a birthday. Go ahead if you all are too idle. Why do you have to ask him to go with you? Now this happens. Let us apologize. - Doctor. - Doctor... Doctor, how is my husband? We're sorry. - Lien! - Lien. Please try to calm down. You still need to claim him. Doctor, please save my husband. - Please, doctor... - Lien. Lien. - Get off of me. - Lien! Are you happy now? - Give me back my An. Give him back. - Lien. We're sorry. Give An back! Where's An? Please calm down. Go away! I don't want to see any of you! An! An, honey... An... Why was it such a bad luck? Life and death are predestined. He left us so fast. He didn't look ill-fated, though. If only he had bought my insurance, his family would have gotten billions now. If he hadn't guzzled those seven shots, he would still be alive. - Yeah. - What did you just say? It's not that, Khanh. I meant he shouldn't drink if it was too much for him. What took you so long? I promised to buy An a pair of earrings for his wife. Now I don't know how to give them to her. You're so considerate. You even had her name carved. Next year, we'll have two death anniversaries on the same date. I wonder how we would split to attend them both. Phuong, have breakfast after you've done. Loan, isn't it? I'm coming. I've heated your leftovers from yesterday. Have some, then attend An's funeral. An's wife has cut ties with us. She doesn't want to see anyone. You can pay him a visit later. And don't blame yourself too much. How's your mat business? Well... What're you doing, Mai? Let's have breakfast. I'm doing my literature homework. You can finish it later. Let's eat first. Be good. Listen to her, Mai. Come over here and have breakfast. Okay. But please help me do my literature homework, Dad. It's super hard. I know. Your teacher told you to take a few days off. You can submit it later. Uncle, please buy me a lottery ticket. - Do you have VNP tracker booklet? - No, sir. Their results are shown online. RESULT VNP LOTTERY COMPANY RESULT Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Why honking? It's not like we can move. Can't you see we're all stuck? What're you honking for? I'm two hours late for my bride. Who are you to be impatient here? I'm sorry. My horn is broken. Good Lord! Just sell the house. I can't live here anymore! Honey, is the meal ready? Wow, that's yummy! Give me a sec. I can eat anything. No research needed. Hey, you shouldn't say that. Pregnant woman has a strict diet. You need something that is good for both you and the baby. Hey, what are you doing? What if you spend it all on cockfighting after winning? An, you keep it. Keep it safe. Before An was gone, he asked me to buy these for you. Lien, why did you bury him so hastily? We haven't bid our farewell. The monk said our signs were incompatible. I had to bury him immediately. Otherwise, bad things would keep happening. Poor him. He worked his ass off all his life, yet he had to wear the same outfit from the accident day to the grave. What did you say? How about his phone? Did you bury it, too? I'm sorry. Hello? - Nam. - It's okay. It's too dangerous, Nam. - I can do it. - Get out. Hurry! Come on! Oh, Lord! Poor Phuong. His whole fortune is in flames! - It's too dangerous! - I'm the owner. - Phuong! - What are you extinguishing? - Phuong! Phuong! - It's too dangerous! It's too dangerous! Let's find out if anyone is still inside. Oh, my God, please save us. Oh, no. Everyone's mats are still inside. And we haven't paid them yet. How could you, Nam? I told you to quit smoking so many times. But you didn't listen. It happened. With such misfortune, nothing we could do. Let's start from scratch again. Phuong... I'm sorry! PHAT IS CALLING PHAT IS CALLING Oh, my God, to the cemetery at this hour? Why don't we go in the morning? Are you out of your mind? Do you want to be spotted? But just thinking about it makes my hair stand on end, let alone exhuming his grave. Loc is right. I don't think this is right. What has gotten into you? What if tomorrow people find out that there are hundreds of billions beneath it? What would happen? Wait, wait. If we actually do it, should we tell Lien? Are you insane? What if she doesn't allow us? Do you want to offer those 130 billion to the dead? Let me tell you this. Even your whole life, your family, your relatives, and even all of ours, still may not be able to make such amount of money. I get it. But whenever I think about exhuming An's body... Please, Toan, I beg you! - "I beg you!" - Ouch! Stay at home if you're so scared. Forensic scientists have been doing the same thing. No one complained about it. Just stop. Look at you. Who doesn't love money? But listen to me, you don't have to sell your soul for it. Exhumation is a criminal act. Think about it. What would happen if the police show up while we are digging his grave and handcuff us all? How many years will we spend in prison for this? You two are still single, so it isn't that bad. But my wife is expecting. I don't want my kid to be fatherless. - We've gotten this far without much money. - Being rich might not make you happy. - Phuong? - But being poor is certainly miserable. I do know this is wrong. But think about it. This is our money. We don't steal from anyone. We do it because we have no other choice. How about this? To ease our minds, after finding the ticket, let's ask Lien to go with us so that she can collect An's sum. That would make amends for this act. What do you think? You have a point. But please consider this. An was our best friend. He passed away not long ago. If we dig the ground and exhume him like that, how can he rest in peace? Not to mention his wife, Lien. How would she think about her husband's best friends digging him up like that? She wouldn't forgive us. This is extremely degenerated. I will not go along. Shut up. Go home if you don't want to go. I don't want to hear any more words from someone like you. Look. You're getting on my nerves. Don't regret it if you stay out of it. Let's go. Hey. What if I follow you guys, but I only stand guard outside? Screw you! Hey. Khanh! Phat, since you don't go, can you give me your share? Loc, are you in or not? - Yes, I am. - And you, if anyone knows about this tomorrow, it's on you. Since I'm not involved, can I take half my share? - Drive. - Hey! Who the hell he thinks he is? Hey! HERE LIES MR. NGUYEN THANH AN I'm sorry. Please bless us to find the ticket. I promise I'll build you a new house. We truly apologize, An. Please forgive me. I'll help you realize your dream, An. You go first for luck, Loc. What? There's no luck in this. If you're familiar with it, go ahead. Loser. DINH YEN CEMETERY Hurry up! Daybreak is coming. You guys do it! God, I won't do it! Gosh, why is it raining at this time? If you're a holy one, An, please bless us with the ticket. We promise to give your share to your family. We'll rebuild your grave properly, An. Loc. Loc. - What are you sitting there for? - Keep it down! Please, Toan. I beg you. I'll do anything you say. I'll die right here if I see his corpse. Shit. If you don't dig, you don't get your share. Big brother, - let me do it. - Can you do it? Yes. My leg! Were you blind, Loc? I almost lost my leg! I'm sorry. - Give it back. - Let me. - Stop. - I can do it. - Don't. - You take a break. Stop it! I don't want to die here. I'm sorry. Move aside now. Why did you drink that much? You scold me even if I do it or not. It's impossible to please you! I see it! Come on. Stronger. Stronger. Come on! The lid is cracked! You got it? I touched it. We'll be damned if it's wet. - Find something to cover it. - Loc. Loc, find something to cover it. I can't take it. Just lift the lid. Quick! Okay. - One, two, three. Up! - One, two, three. Up! An! An. An! An. Have you seen it? - Have you seen it yet, Phuong? - Have you seen it? - Got it. Yes, I did. - You did? Let's go over there. - Take it easy. - Slow, slow, slow. - Careful. - Careful, Phuong. Slow, slow, slow. Let me take a look. I'll give you some light. This is it. The ticket will be soaked. What are you doing? Damn you! Since there was an unspoken understanding Our friendship carries our dreams So we can gaze at a brighter tomorrow To pen our life stories, my friends... - 136,8 billion. - 136 billion. - Divided by six. - By six. How much that makes? - We'll have 22,8 billion each. - Shut up. It's only five. - What? - What do you mean? What? Do you think it's a cakewalk to find this ticket? Phat had a chance to join, but he refused. So he lost his share. We gotta put our feet down so no feelings get hurt afterward. What do you think? I don't think so. It will be very awkward when we meet him. Then we vote. Raise your hand if you agree not to give Phat his share. All right. If you're scared, blame it all on us. Also, you fat ass jerk! We broke our necks digging, and you sat there drinking. You only deserve to get half your share. What are you saying, Khanh? What right do you have to take half my share? I bought wine and incense to make offerings to An. - You offered yourself first. - And you! Your drunken ass almost plowed through my head. Cut it out. Don't push him. At 8:00 a.m. sharp tomorrow, gather at my house. We'll go to An's to light him an incense. Then we will ask Lien to go with us. - Cover the ticker, or it will get wet. - No, it won't. Shut up. Loc, you listen to me carefully. Watch your yabbering mouth! If everybody knows, it'll be troublesome. Get it? Yes. There's so much going on lately. I'm lucky to have you to look after Mai. I don't know how I can manage by myself. Well, don't mention it. Mai is such a lovely girl. I see her as my own daughter. Dad, are you up? Mai! Dad? Dad. Not this one. Dad? Are you up? Dad? Dad! Ms. Loan? When did you come? Why didn't you wake me up? I came very early, Mai. I've been tidying up your father's room. It's messy. My dad will scold me if I button like that. Yeah. I was in a hurry this morning. Dad, wake up! Give my blanket back. Come on, Dad. You need to help me with my homework. Check, please. It's still early. He said to meet at eight. Why the rush? Go inside and wake him up. What if he oversleeps? Why are you so hasty with your life? You've waited whole morning but can't give it ten minutes more? Then who came to my house at 5:00 a.m. and woke me up? It's Khanh. He asked me to do it. Good girl. Finish up so you can take your medicine. You can only go back to school once you're better. - Okay. - Why are you getting hot again? Your sickness is unpredictable. Get well soon, and I'll take you to the beach this summer, okay? Wow. That's cool! - Phuong! - Hey! Are you up, Phuong? - Phuong, are you up? Phuong? - Here. I'm afraid you might oversleep. These offerings are good enough for him, aren't they? Why is it docked here today? It was at the end of the road last time. Maybe they didn't let her dock there anymore. He is somehow so lucky. He can change the view regularly. Keep your voice down. She's still mourning. Lien isn't home? What's the matter? Oh, God. Khanh, take a look! - What? What's wrong? - Let's go. Leave. Come on. - I didn't get to film it. - What for? Shit. How on earth can she do that? Why didn't you let me call that bitch out? Ignore her. How can I? I'm hopping mad for An. She does it, knowing his grave is still fresh. Leave it. It has nothing to do with you. What? Didn't you see her the other day? How she howled and ran us down? She acted as if she loved him truly. She must have cuckolded him way back. What a slut! I don't get it. I think you should be thankful for that guy. What? - Can't you see? - What do you mean? It means we can ignore his share. What's wrong with you? We made an oath in front of his grave. Tell me, if An was still alive, seeing how his wife was cheating on him, would he give her 20 billion VND? Answer me. So we divide 136,8 billion by four, don't we? That's right. Right my ass! The deal is that you only receive half of your share. You would burn all of that sum in gambling anyway. Then, just like An's wife, your wife will cheat on you. - Let us keep it. - You're way out of line, Khanh. What did you just say? - Stop. - Khanh. You go with Toan. And you come with me. Where are the drinks? - I threw them away. - What? Why? You! What the fuck? Stop it. Stop. - Just ignore him. - Go buy us new drinks. Iced coffee for me. Okay. What do you want, Toan? Anything. - Khanh? - What? - What do you have? - Something cool. Hey, what is Phuong doing? Follow him! Bittersweet memories still linger And we're undoubtedly together Side by side, we have no fear... Try to call him. - Did he pick up? - No. He didn't pick up? He turned it off. Fuck! Does he want it all for himself? Not happening. Don't lose him. The number you have dialed is not in service. HAI GA IS CALLING He doesn't like you. Go find him. Khanh, I'm listening. - What happened to Mai? - Hey. She was so joyful this morning, then suddenly she came down with a fever. Her lips turned blue. She couldn't breathe. Out of panic, I brought her here. - Who are Mai's family? - I am. She has a severe case of pneumonia. Fortunately, she was treated in time. Her condition is now steady. But we still need to keep a close watch on her. Meanwhile, you can finish her admission procedure. Stay here with your friends. Let me handle it, so you can look after her. How is Mai, Phuong? Where are our drinks, Loc? I threw them. Do you think money grows on trees and you can do whatever you want? Where is my change? It was 500,000 VND. Do you think a motorbike taxi is free? - Let him have it. It isn't much. - I would if he asked. He took it out only after I asked. Of course, it isn't much. But I'm extremely annoyed by such behavior. If you're so great, why didn't you go? You always sound so condescending. It wasn't that much money. - Stingy! - What did you say? Stop. Don't, Khanh. And you, take this money to buy him something cool to mollify him. Go. Don't mind him, Khanh. Why do you have to be bothered by this? What is the plan now, Phuong? Let Mai get better first. Then we collect the prize. I think you should collect the money first. You can bring her to the big city or even overseas for treatment. - That might give her a better chance. - Khanh has a point. But I need to wait for the diagnosis. The coolest drink they have here is herbal tea. Phuong. Here. Here's the change. You give it back when there isn't much. Why give back to me when it's more? Stop. We're in hospital. When I have the money, I'll pay you back ten times this. Hello? Hey. Thank you. Phuong. Phuong. What's wrong? Shit! Please give me five bottles. This one? Give me a sec. - Hey, beautiful. - Five bottles. Lend me some money for gasoline. You're giving me more trouble. Lend it to me, and I'll pay you back ten times. Ten times? You're giving me another surprise or what? You don't even have a penny. Talking about ten times. It's 50,000. Let me tell you something. Once I become a billionaire, don't be on your knees asking for money. You become a billionaire? As if. You only bring me trouble. - It's 10,000. Know your limit. - I'll have a pack of biscuits. Hey, the change. Hey, Loc! - I'll pay you back tomorrow. - Holy hell, Loc, that's my tontine! Don't you dare hide, scum! - I am not. - Then why didn't you pick up the phone? Because I didn't have the money. But I'll pay you back this afternoon. With interest. - Take his money. Search him. - Where's the money? Here. This is for the interest rate days ago. Take the money, but give the ticket back. You have no money, yet you bought a lottery. Give it back. I'll clear 10,000 for you. Give me back my ticket, you dogs! Who do you call "dogs," dog? You dare to trash-talk me? What did you say? Do you want me to rip this ticket off? - I dare you! Ouch! - Shut up! My 136 billion VND! Check the result. VNP LOTTERY COMPANY - RESULT Shit. I only ripped off my parking ticket. That was close! Give it back! Are you crazy? Huh? - They took our ticket! - Hey! - Run! - Run! - You bastard! - Hey! Run quickly! - Hey! - Stop right there! - Hey! - Hai Ga! - Stop! - Hey! This way. - Why do you always run after me? - Why are you scolding me? - This way. - Shit! It's a dead end! If you dare to come here, I'll end you! Give me back my ticket. Ouch! You will go to jail if you strangle me. Where's the ticket? I don't have it. Hai Ga has it. Where are they, Loc? Where is the ticket? - Hey! - Damn you! Hey! Go check that big lottery ticket vendor over there. Such a good fortune! Hello. Have you seen this guy dropping by here? Oh, my God! You really hit the jackpot? - You did! Congratulations, billionaire! - Yeah. Thank you! No wonder you're glowing in aura! I've directed him to another vendor. I don't have enough money. To where? - To the... - To where? Come on. How can I have hundreds of billions here? If you wish to receive the prize, you have to go to their headquarter in the city. They have money there. - The city? - Yes. Dang, I have never visited the city before. You can go there to receive the money and visit the place. They want to take my ticket. Don't tell them I'm here. Hey, why are you hiding in my house? Oh, my God! Here. This one. Ma'am, have you seen anyone coming to claim the jackpot? Yes. Where is he now? He's gone. He came to collect the prize. But I don't have enough money. So I told him to go to the city. - Why didn't you say so? - You didn't ask! Go. Let's go! - Handsome but rude. - I'm sorry. Hey, they're gone. Whose scooter is blocking the way? That's Loc's. Khanh, Toan. You're going to get a huge amount of cash. Be careful, okay? Yes, ma'am. Thank you. I'm off. - Loc! - Go, go! Loc, stop! Stop! Oh God, please help him escape. - Hey! - Hey! Stop! Ouch. Ouch! Get away! You stop right there! Hey, hey! You want to ruin this place or something? No, sir! No, no. We're after that guy. He's a robber! We're sorry! Sorry! It's 170,000 for 20 kg. Plus 150,000 for that pile. So, 320,000 in total. Okay, sir. That's heavy. I'll leave them here, okay? Hey, why don't you leave them over there? Can you help me with that? Oh my God! I'm done! Thang! Thang! It's not me. He fell down by himself. You can't ride like a thief on the run in an alley. - Serve him right. - Help him, or he'll die. Loc. Loc, wake up. ALL FOR YOUR HEALTH TAM TRI DONG THAP Why are you always bringing me troubles, Loc? Why do you keep giving me surprises, Loc? Why were you rushing like that? You should have taken it slow? Or were you checking out girls? I know you so well! But you're still lucky. The doctor said that you would have lost your willy if the injury was 2 cm lower. Your friends brought you here. You should thank them later. I need to go to the city for a day or two. Let me know when there's something urgent. Okay. Is something wrong? I will tell you later. Hello. Have you purchased any health insurance for your daughter? - Not yet. - In her current condition, she needs to be hospitalized at least up to two weeks. The estimated treatment cost would be around 100 million VND. I want to inform you in advance for preparation. Now excuse me. Hello, ma'am, have you seen my husband? He's giving me another surprise! Whoa, what a kick! It seems we're going to have a frisky tot. Who do you think whom he would take after? - Stop it. - Phat. Hey, Loc. Come in. - Hello Loc. - Trinh. It's been a while. How're you doing? I'm good. Please come in. When will he be delivered? The doctor said his due date will be next month. How about you and Yen? Any good news? Not yet. Just stay here and chat with Phat. I'll bring you guys something to drink. Please, don't be too formal. I don't need a drink. Of course we have to be formal. We're supposed to have warm welcome for the billionaire. Take a seat, Mr. Billionaire. What brings you here, Mr. Billionaire? You've already gotten your share, haven't you? I have no share. Not even one penny. - But that's ridiculous. Is it true? - You gotta speak up for me, Phat. How can I? You end up like this even though you join them from the beginning. I wasn't even there. How can I help? - Oh my! - See? I have to get out of the hospital in this condition to see you. What happened to you? Long story. Another time. Now, if you do not speak up for me, they'll collect all of the money for themselves. My family is peaceful. Please don't involve me in this. In fact, we're doing fine without that money. Now please leave. There's no way I can help you. Phat, please! I know you're well-off without that money. But not me. If I don't pay off my debt, I won't be able to make it. Please save me, Phat! Khanh made us vote. But they overwhelmed me by three. That's why I need you. With Lien. There will be also three of us. Please save me, Phat. You greedy bastards, sort it out yourselves. - I have my own business to attend to. - Don't leave me hanging! Please leave. Your wife is pregnant, Phat. I wonder if she can cope knowing such terrible news. Does she know you're having an affair with Lien? What kind of bullshit are you talking about? I'm not the only witness. Our whole gang saw it from the outside, too. What are you talking about? Khanh? - Is it okay to let Phuong keep the ticket? - It's his, so he should keep it. Besides, Phuong will not do anything behind our back. He's coming. - Are you guys done? - Toan. What took you so long? How's Mai? - She's all right. - Yeah? Lien is calling. What now? Ignore her. It's too late for her. Maybe she's into you. I wonder why she isn't interested in me as well. Let's go. Yuck, Loc's blood is all over the place. How can I sit there? Lien keeps calling. Just pick up the phone to see what she wants to say. Hi, Lien. Phuong? Haven't you heard? - What? - Your lottery ticket hits the jackpot! How do you know? - Phuong. - Lien? How can you win with such bizarre line of numbers? These are the birthdays of the six of us. If I win, I'll share the money equally to everyone. We can all be happy. - Well... - Are you at home? I can drop by your house. Mine is just a few minutes from yours. I'm not home. What's the matter, anyway? You know, An has just passed away. We're also knees deep in debt. We barely scraped by. Can you take pity on me and give me An's share? No, we can't. We'll have to divide it by four then. Hey Lien, it's Khanh. Try to think before opening your mouth. I have never met a woman as wicked and treacherous as you. What rights do you have to take that money? Khanh. You're a grown man. Please choose your words properly. What do you mean by properly? Lien, Khanh has softened his punch significantly. You're an unredeemable whore and you ask for respect? An has just laid down and his grave is still fresh, and you took another guy home, had sex right in front of his altar. So what rights do you really have? Wait? Khanh, who the hell is talking to me? It's Toan. No wonder. Well, that is my personal right. Who the hell are you to tell me what to do? Or you're pissed because you can't have me? Fuck you! Enough. Stop fighting! Well, but Lien, we don't even know where the ticket is at the moment. I don't think this is mistaken. I don't care whose it is before that. What I only care is that you guys are stealing my husband's fortune. Khanh! What? Are you going to hit me? We apologize. Get ready to travel with us. Stop scrubbing. It stinks. It's not like we're going on a tour. Just do it casually. Will you able to stand it during the whole way to the city? We have to wait for Lien anyway. Let him clean. Funny you say it. What if there's someone else arrives before her? Hey! Hello, brothers. I'm glad I made it in time. Well, you all dress up smartly for our big prize today. You're all here. Are you guys actually planning to go without me? Geez. So much for the word "brothers" after all of this. What horseshit are you talking about? You shrugged it off at the beginning. Now what are you asking for? When did I shrug it? I don't shrug off money, Khanh. I simply did not wish to doing bad deed with you guys. Hey. What are you implying? You had your chance. What are you blaming us for? I don't blame you guys. I just think you are all assholes. What did you just say? Huh? Relax. Why are you so high-strung? Hey. Look. If I didn't take those stabs for you guys back then, could you still be able to stand here and talk to me? Mats, everyone. No! DINH YEN MAT MARKET - Move away. - Move. Go away! Mats, everyone. - How can I help you? - Have you paid your protection racket? - What's up, Phuong? - Ignore them. Hey. - What do you want? - Have you paid for this space? We didn't have to pay before. This time is different. Got a problem with that? - Any problems? - Get off my face. You bold shit. What are you doing? Phuong... - Phat! - Phat! Phat! Phat! Phat! Phat! I was just testing you guys. I don't need the money anyway. Stop bickering. We should divide the prize equally to everyone here. If not, we'll see no end of this. All right. But how does he deserve it after all the messes he caused? Why not? He has the right, too. He only did that because you guys constantly pushed him over the edge. Now, to be fair, raise your hand if you agree that Loc deserves his share. You are not allowed to join. I think we should divide it equally to everyone. Yeah. Hey, friends, as time flies Bittersweet memories still linger And we're undoubtedly together Side by side, we have no fear Hey, friends, no need to hide I'll always be here To share your ups and downs No matter where our lives take us Always in our hearts You and I are friends forever Our weather-worn friendship Has shown us... Phuong, can you make it less bumpy for me? It's the road. Not me. Or maybe can you please change the song? It sounds hurt. We've just started. How can we reach the city? Are you guys thirsty? We can have a short break. I'll buy you guys some drinks. What would you like to drink, Lien? I'll ask Loc to buy for you. I'm not thirsty. Thank you. I've slept enough. Dang! What? Phuong. Can you drop by any kind of pharmacy? I need to buy some medicines and bandages. It's so bumpy, I think my stitches are all torn. Where can I find a pharmacy on this road? If you are not well, find a place to rest and carry on tomorrow. You're such a bother, Loc. If you didn't feel like going, stay at home. why did you follow us? Am I not allowed to groan now? Don't be too harsh. Yeah. Or else he will die. Here. I only have these. See if you can use any of them. But they aren't expired, are they? I'm standing next to you. You can speak softly. Right! These things aren't expired, are they? Why did you talk so loud? I don't know. I bought them a really long time ago. But are they safe? Just give it a try. If you feel itchy... just take it out. Here. Your room keys. This one has a single bed. This one has two. The single bed. Go wash yourself, then head over to have some porridge. My hostel is under renovation. You startled me. But it has been pouring down, so I've been managed all by myself. There's not much, so I hope you don't mind. - Yes. - There's some wine in the cabinet. Help yourself. You pay for whatever you drink. - Yes. - Uncle. Is it okay if we set things off early tomorrow? No problem. I'm an early riser. Yes. Allow me to go to bed. Just down this way. Call me if you need anything. - Thank you, sir. - Let's eat. I'm famished. His ears are as deaf as a post, yet he wants us to call him anytime. How is it possible? Won't you get troubles from the poultry? I heard a fresh wound would itch like crazy once you eat chicken. Jeez, rather than die from starving. This feast is missing something. Wine, isn't it? It is. - Khanh. - What? We have to leave early tomorrow. - We haven't celebrated, you know? - Yeah. A little fun won't hurt anyone. This round is to celebrate us becoming billionaires tomorrow. Two, three, cheers! Khanh, please don't force anyone to binge drink. You! Why don't you try it, Lien? Uncle's wine is quite good. Have a taste. No. I can't drink. "No. I can't drink." Every woman says the same thing. But once they party, they outdrink all the men. Yeah. Just to warm yourself. Have a drink. - You're doing great. - Is it good? - Good, right? - Pretty good, isn't it? Ew! It's gross. I don't understand why you guys are obsessed with this horrible drink. May I have a photo? I forgot to take one with An the other day. Let's take a photo. Hey. - Look here. Where're you looking at? - One, two... Lien, Lien. Lien, Lien. Smile. Ready? One, two, three... Okay. Thank you everyone. Wait. Hold up. Don't put it away. Use your phone to record everyone's thoughts. After receiving such a large sum of money, what will they do? I'll let you go first. Speak. Hello, everyone. I'm Phat. If I have a large sum of money, I'll take my wife and children on a trip across Vietnam. And, especially, I will open a big insurance agency. Lien. Your turn. It's your turn. Speak your mind. I don't know. Why don't you know? Just like An, he dreamed about building a house on land. How about you? What do you like? Speak. I'll film. Please excuse me. What's wrong, Lien? Lien. We'll make do with what we have. Cheers! - Cheers. - Cheers! Cheers! Have a drink, then I'll tell you my billionaire dream. Okay. Your turn. I dream... I can find a gorgeous wife with a big titties, skin as white as pomelo blossoms, and fat ass. You just want a wife for public display? You nuts! My mom told me women with big butts could give birth easily. All right. Congratulations to your big butt. - Cheers! - Cheers. I'll pay off all my debt. Then, I'll build a chicken farm. And every time I'm bored, I can host a cockfight by myself. Sounds perfect, yeah? Stop bullshitting. You only do that so you could gamble at every whim. Am I right? Lien? Lien. Who is it? I'm Toan. What's the matter? I only had a few drinks, and now I'm experiencing stomach pain. - Can you lend me your medicated oil? - Medicated oil? Give me a second. Who's that? What are you doing? Who made you sad? Get off me, Toan! What're you doing? I do nothing. Are you crazy? Hey! Help! Help me! Get off me! Help me! Help me! Your turn, Khanh. - Huh? Me? - Yeah. I'd like to start an ecotourism business. Welcoming all... Please, Toan! Please let me go! Toan! What are you doing, Toan? Are you out of your mind? Did the alcohol have the best of you? Lien, it's okay. She isn't worth your defending! Shit! You defiled Lien. What're you doing? What are you doing, Toan? Here, shoot me. Make sure it looks good. Come on. Please don't yell at me if it looks bad, big brother. I'll buy the storage that I'm renting. I want our village to keep developing the traditional mats weaving craft like the old days. Guys, please stop fighting! What is that? Oh my God! Toan! Toan! - What happened to you, Toan! - Toan! Wake up, Toan! Toan! Toan. Toan. Phuong. He's dead. Please forgive me, Toan. I beg you. I... I didn't mean to kill him. Toan. I didn't do this on purpose. You have to believe me! I didn't kill anyone. I just wanted to protect Lien. If you don't believe, you can ask her. What should we do now? I don't want to be arrested, Phuong. My wife is expecting a child. I still have a family, Phuong. Please, I beg all of you. Don't call the police. Phuong! But he's dead. - I beg you. - We cannot go along with this, Phat. I beg you! I'm so sorry. Please do not report me to the police. But we can't conceal this. Khanh! I know. I know, Khanh! I will never let you guys get involved in this. I will take on all of the responsibilities. You will not be involved. Don't worry about it. Just don't let anyone else know about this. Please don't let anyone else know about this. After dealing with Toan... I'm going to quit. I won't join in anymore. I won't join in claiming the money. I will give you all of my share.

Can you let me sleep with you tonight? What? Open up, Phuong. Khanh. Why do you guys sleep so early? Get up and drink with me, Phuong. Phuong. I can't drink anymore, Khanh. You get up! Get up! I'm injured, Khanh. I drank a lot already. I've reached my limit. Ask Phuong, please. I'm tired. And we need to leave early tomorrow. Such a nuisance inviting you two. Whatever. Loc... do not dare to look down on me. You're worse than nothing. Jeez, I haven't done anything to you at all, Khanh. If you're drunk, please go to bed, Khanh. You're drunk. Get some sleep. And you. Don't think you are in the clear. Right. You're holding the ticket. You are the big shot now. It doesn't matter who holds it. Oh, yeah? Give it to me, then. I'll keep it. I will, tomorrow, once you're sober. Phuong is right, Khanh. You're drunk now. What if you rip it off by accident? Shut the fuck up! You two look down on me, don't you? I can't stand you like this, Khanh. You're always like that. Every single time you're drunk, you are out of control. You said I am out of control? Who was the one forcing An to binge drink? Who? You mean I was the one... Who pushed An to his death? That I murdered my friend? Weren't you? How could he die by accident if you didn't force him to drink seven rounds straight? Go back. Sleep. Where are you? It doesn't look good, Phuong. Khanh! Khanh, Khanh! - Khanh! - Khanh! EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, STAFF ONLY Family members please stay outside. I'm not doing well, Phuong. Is that your blood or his? The stitches are all torn. - Loc! - Sir, are you okay? Sir? - Hello, sir. - Hello, sir. Yes. - Hello, sir. - Hello, sir. Please go this way. Hello, sir. Welcome you to our company. I believe today is your lucky day. Yes, thank you. First, please allow us to check your ticket. Please don't worry. Aside from us, we even have security cameras capturing this appraisal. Please give us your signature on this handover record. Now, allow me to appraise it. LOTTO DRAW RESULT Congratulations, sir, you've won the jackpot with the total amount of 136 billion and 800 million VND. Yes. Thank you. However, you are subjected to 10% of your personal income tax. - I'm aware of that. - Next step I'll carry out an in-depth appraisal through the microscope. - Please wait a moment. - Okay. I'm sorry, sir. Your ticket has a problem. What's wrong with my ticket? Calm down, sir. Please take a look at the screen. This is clearly number 3. Yet it was redrawn to look like number 8. I've bought this from a lottery vendor. How can it be a fraud? I do not imply that the ticket is a fraud. It was indeed printed by our company. However, it was tampered with. Hence, it is not valid. How can it be? Please check it again carefully. You have observed the whole appraisal process. We also have witnesses and camera footages. And I can guarantee this ticket wasn't tampered with. Please check it again for me! I understand your feelings. However, I simply follow our protocols. Please sit down. Please stay calm. If you don't cooperate, we won't be able to come up with any solutions. This is ridiculous! - Please return to your seat. - I bought this ticket myself. But are you certain that you always keep it by your side since purchasing? We will temporarily seal off this ticket. Phuong, get up. You've been lying around like this for days. You'll eventually get sick. Get up and have breakfast with me. We still need to pay Mai a visit. Get up. I know. I have never seen you like this. Mai has recovered. She's waiting for you in the hospital. In the past couple of days, your employees and everyone else constantly asked for their payment. I didn't know what to do. Have you had any plans for our business? My aunt has business in Thailand. I shared with her our goal to develop mat weaving crafts. After hearing that, she was so thrilled about it. She would keep an eye out for potential partners for us. Really? Thank you. Hi. Mai! - Dad! - Baby girl. When can I go back home, dad? When you're fully recovered. But I am, dad. You need to eat more. That's how you get well. Yes, dad. By the way, please take a look at the draft of my literature homework, dad. - Did you write it yourself? - Yes. Good girl. Okay. Have some porridge. I'll read it. I tried to help. But Mai didn't want to. She wanted to do it by herself. Oh, my. It's hot. Be careful. Don't forget to read it, dad. Let me know if it's okay. So that I can rewrite it if needed. I'm late for submission already. I know. You keep reminding me. I promise I'll read it. I'll just leave you two alone. I need to take care of some business. I'll make lunch and bring it over. - Thank you. - You must come back quickly to hang out with me, miss Loan. I know. - Bye bye, miss Loan. - Bye. How you fawn upon her. It's time for our daily assessing. Family members, please wait outside. Yes. Be good. Let the doctors do their work. I'll head to the canteen to buy a notebook and a pen for you. Then you can write and submit your homework to your teacher. Yes, dad. - Bye bye, baby girl. - Bye bye, dad. Are you mad at me because I went to the city without telling you first? It was so urgent that I couldn't inform you in time. I didn't mean anything by it. Please, stop crying. If you keep crying, our baby will be born ugly. - 10,000 VND. - What do you want to buy? - I'll have two pens, too. - My God! It is unbelievable! The jackpot was 140 billion VND! That is mind-blowing! It's VNP digital lottery. Don't you know? If I won that much, I wouldn't know what to do. I can spend it for you, if you don't know. But how can anyone be so lucky? Don't you trust me? I'll show you on my phone. Let me see. At VNP headquarter this morning, the jackpot ceremony was held to give the prize to the lucky customer who bought the line of number: 10-16-18-20-27-28. With the total amount of the jackpot is 136 billion and 800 million VND. If only Lottery God blesses me with just a hundred billion VND, my life would already be completed. - I'm here, big brother. - Loc. When you took my ticket, did anyone else get a hold of it? Only Hai Ga. But you saw it yourself, Phuong. Anyway, how much each of us would get? Nobody gets anything. Our ticket was swapped. Why was it swapped? Who could have done such evil thing? Uncle. They can only swap your ticket after they buy something similar. The girl who stood next to me and talked to me do you remember her, uncle? Right, right. I do remember. It was a woman. Which number did she buy? Daughter, when is my birthday? Do you remember? - Right... - She looks so stunned. She is still young, yet she can't remember her father's birthday. So how can I remember what number that woman bought? How do we know who is the culprit? What is it? No. It wasn't me. Huh? Isn't it? This. Yeah. You want to see this, don't you? Here. What are you rubbing it for? Oh, zooming in, right? Do you want to zoom in? Jeez, you gotta speak up. Here. What is it, Khanh? Khanh? Do you have anything else to explain? I was the one who go there to claim the prize. I'm sorry for fooling you guys. But it's not like what you think. On the day An passed away, I followed through to claim him home. Who's there? Phat? An kept a lottery ticket of our gang. And it hits the jackpot. The prize is more than 130 billion VND! This is it. Now, you have to keep this between us. If you agree, we'll split the money in half. Is it okay? What? Think, Lien. You and your husband worked yourselves to the bone for years for almost nothing. This is an once-a-life-time opportunity to escape poverty. And it is also An's wish. But... But what? I think it's fine. But what if the others also come to speed? How can we explain to them? Simply say you are not aware of it and you have disposed of his clothes. Good Lord! But that's a lot of money. Can they easily accept our excuse? Certainly not. We are no fools, Lien. You took your husband to the hospital. You were also the one who buried him. How could you not notice his phone's bulge in his pants when changing his clothes? - That's right. - Even if you get the money, how can we spend it? Where's the money? There's only one way to pull this off. We swap it with the exact look-alike ticket, then we blame the vendor. What? - Swap the ticket? - Yes. I did buy a ticket. And it looks exactly the same. The only difference is the last number which is 23. My birthday. I know how to handle this. You can proceed with An's burial. In the gang, An and I were the closest to each other. Now he's gone, I'll look after you on his behalf. Listen to me, don't be dismayed. It's okay. From now on, I'll give you a hand. So you can have a better life. You need to allow yourself to take in all the good things in life. What are you doing, Phat? He took his chance when I was in shock and fragile... He defiled me. But he did something even more unimaginable. He filmed it and used the footage to threaten me. Many, many times. Finally, he demanded that I transferred all of the lottery money to him. He left me only a few billions, which is already worth a fortune to me. Then he forced me to move away. Do you have anything else to say? That's funny. You invited me here so that you could draw this outrageous story? And you should take a step back, Lien. I have a family. You can't conjure up such a lie against me. Why don't you believe me, Phuong? Am I really that bad? Right? Still denying it? Look. This is the bank invoice showing the transaction between you and Lien. Lien transferred the money that she owed me, is that wrong? Was that illegal? Was it? Is there anything else you want to talk? If not, please don't ever bother me again. So long. Toan. Phuong! Wait for me, Phuong! Phuong, Phuong! Phuong, stop! Phuong! Phuong! Lower your window. Lower your window, please, Phuong. Can we discuss this? I was wrong back then. I'm sorry. Please don't take it out on me. Please forgive all the stupid things I've said to you. - Miss, may I ask? - What's wrong, dear? Where is the canteen, miss? Go down this hallway, then down the stairs. - Thank you, miss. - Okay. Thank you for trusting and using our bank's services. Phuong, if you still have mercy on me, can you just allow me to have half my share? - Hello, miss. - Hi, dear. - Hi. - Yes? - Have you seen where Mai went? - I think she went looking for her dad.

At the moment, the child has entered a deep coma caused by a severe head injury, in addition to her previous unstable health condition. Please, doctor, you have to save my daughter at all costs. I can pay for whatever is necessary. Doctor. Please save her! Please, doctor! Please save my daughter! Please! We always spare no effort. No matter how much money you have, it won't help her current situation. Mai could no longer wait, so she went looking for you. When I came, I couldn't catch her in time. I'm sorry. When she was unconscious, she kept repeating one, two, and three... until she completely passed out. Have you read her literature homework? Don't forget to help me with my literature homework, dad. I know. Please take a look at the draft of my literature homework, dad. - Did you write it yourself? - Yes. - Okay, I'll read it. Happy? - Yeah. My mother passed away early, so my dad is also my mom. Although he's super busy, he always cares for me, loves me, and looks after me every day. I like to think of my daddy as a fairy godfather. Because whenever I need, he always appears after I close my eyes and count to three. But my daddy broke his promise again. He promised to go home early to have dinner with me. He promised to play tic-tac-toe with me. He promised not to lie to me. He promised to take me out. - You've promised, dad. - I promise. I know. You promised that you would never cry. But... even when you break your promises a hundred or thousand times, I still love you. Because I'm very lucky to have a daddy like you. I promise to study hard so you'll be happy. Phuong. Khanh. I'm sorry. The fault is mine as well.

Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! He has never been away this long. - Even when he is, he still informs us. - Yes. Loan, thank you for taking care of us all this time. I have to leave for a while. And I don't know when I can return. Please look after Mai and my home for me. Have something. He will come back eventually. Hello. Toan asked me to deliver this to you two. And he won't be able to return. You... Oh my God, honey! The mat business is my life career. Please keep it afloat. I will do my best to come back soon. Can you wash the dishes without breaking any of them? How can you ever be a billionaire? Are you crazy? What's wrong? You wanna give me another surprise this early, Loc? Pick your jaws up from the floor! I promised to be your fairy godfather, but I couldn't. It's too difficult to be fairy godfather. I'm sorry, my sweetie. You have to go to work. Then I will stop counting to three. I will count to a hundred! Is that okay? Even if you don't have me, you should still try to listen to Miss Loan, okay? Yes, daddy. Recently, the court has sentenced the defendant Le Quan Phat to three years in prison for the crime of involuntary manslaughter. However, due to the defendant's severe illness, the execution of the prison sentence has been postponed until his health has been recovered. Defendants Nguyen Thanh Phuong, Le Van Loc and Huynh Van Khanh were charged with graves desecration. In light of the fact that these offenders admitted their guilt willingly and were willing to accept responsibility for their actions, the trial panel decided to sentence each defendant to one year of non-custodial reform.
