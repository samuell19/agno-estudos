But I'm still gonna see you tonight, right? Yes, you will, honey. Oh, good. You're still here. Hi, honey. I thought you went to the gym. I bought a cake. Oh. Well, that's nice. Yeah, well, except it isn't really 'cause they messed it up. They misspelled my name. Who can't spell "Sue?" - Hello. - Hey, Sue. Where's Karl? He's in the den. You want me to get him? No, no, I'm just calling to remind him about the loan. Okay. The station goes under, I'm on your couch, Sue. Okay. But did you call about anything else? What else would I be calling about? Well, just think about it. What day is today? Tuesday? Na... Nancy, you should come over for dinner tonight. I don't eat dinner anymore. I'm on the air in 15 minutes. I gotta go. You are important.

And I'm here to here to help. So, what's your story? I'm Gloria Michaels, and I'm on your side. In heartbreaking news, 13-year-old Emma Rose is still missing. Her parents spoke at a news conference this morning. I know that my Emma is out there. And I know that I'm gonna see her again. Emma, we love you. I can't wait for you to come home. There you are. We have everything ready for you, okay. Come on home to Mommy and Daddy. - Sue. - We love you. We love you so much, Emma Rose. Sorry. Hello? Hi, this is Sue at Sidewinder Safety Tubs. My colleague had to step away for a moment. I look forward to solving your problems. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking to? Go fuck yourself. Okay. What did you just put in your back pocket? Are you stealing from us? No. What? Oh, Rita. Rita! - Honey. - Mm. Remember how we agreed that you wouldn't scream my name unless you were dying or receiving pleasure. You see that little felon you hired? He's stealing from us. I am not. I... I swear I am not. I saw you put the phone in your pocket. My crappy old phone. Looks like one of these brand new phones sealed in a box, and tied up in security wire. Honey bear, it appears you were wrong and should apologize. Oh, look at that. I gotta tow. See you at supper. - All right. - Hey, Rita, listen, I really do appreciate this job. - I know. - And I swear I do not steal... anymore. But listen, it's okay if you still wanna commit crimes every now and then. No, I don't. I do not. But if you ever need a partner for one of your crime jobs, promise you'll consider me. What? No! Oh, what, you think I'm too old? Huh? I'm robbing people every day in here. Look how much I'm charging for this shit. Uh, I appreciate the offer, Rita, but when Jonelle got pregnant, I swore that I'd quit. I'm about to be a daddy. And I figure it's time I stop stealing stuff and start being a model citizen. There is nothing exciting about being a model citizen. I mean, we do the same boring shit every day, - and then you die. - Hmm. I mean, it's really sad that young girls can't leave their homes anymore without some sick pervert snatching them up. It's a crazy world. Oh, did you say something? Yes, I did. I said it's a crazy world. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear Janet Happy birth... ♪ Bonjour. La Femme Aimée. Hi. I would like to make a dinner reservation for two people tonight. We have a table for two at 8:30. Gosh, that's awfully late. Do you have anything... - No. - Okay. That-that's fine. The name is-is Buttons. Sue Buttons. Sue Buttons. - Yes. - Okay, got it. I hear your place is very swanky... We have you down for 8:30. Okay. You cannot be here. You get us Karl, you get to retire. Wasn't that the deal, Petey? Well, it sure was. And I hooked you up with Karl, so... We went to the bank today, Petey. And guess what? Karl doesn't work there anymore. Well, that is weird because he should... Have a seat. We treated you okay, Petey. - Yeah. - We gave you work, paid you well. And after all the kindness we showed you, you wanna leave us. Come on, Mina. But you said you had a money guy. You remember that, right, Petey? My dad is not a patient man when it comes to his money. - So where's Karl? - I don't know. He switched branches! He's at the Stanlow Bank on Clark and Forth. It took one minute to sell out your brother? One minute? Let him go! Or I'll shoot you in the face with this gun. What, are you gonna blow off my big toe? No, your face. Okay, well, right now you're at my kneecap. You gonna kneecap me? That's my vagina. You gonna shoot me in the vagina? No, I respect that area. Yeah, you respect that area? Rita! It's not nice to point guns at people. Let's go. Obviously, this has been a very frustrating morning. - This is my frustrated face. - Okay. And I don't want to be frustrated anymore. - Yeah. - So do us a favor, and don't tell Karl we're coming. 'Cause I'd hate to come back if he disappears again. Sure! Did you see that? Yeah, are you okay? You're bleeding. I can't believe I was in a street fight! - I feel so alive! - All right, calm down. This is not a game. And where'd you get a gun? I found it in the Whole Foods parking lot. Looks good on me, right? Hi. How can I help you two today? Hi, we're looking for Karl. Are you currently banking with us? Because if not, I'd be happy to help you set up some new accounts. We're looking for Karl. All right. Well, listen, if you need a loan, or if you have any other financial questions, my name's Steve, and numbers are my thing. We're looking for Karl. Oh, okay. Well... Ow. Okay. Well, he's just, uh... Just down over there. Just... He's the third office from the left, so... Good grip there. We're not happy, Karl. Hey. I didn't see you come in. I was just looking for something in the trash. A receipt. You changed branches. Yeah. Didn't I tell you? I, uh... I sent you an e-mail. Must've gone to your spam folder. Would you rather have one eye, or one ear? I don't want to do this anymore. I could lose my job. I could go to jail! Three million. Jesus! I can't wash all this! I swallowed my tooth! He swallowed his tooth. Let's see. Oh, dear. Clean accounts by tomorrow. Karl, I'm sorry to barge into your place of work... but you are taking me to dinner tonight. You are not working late, because it's my birthday. Answer your damn phone, Petey. Petey, I don't know how, they... they found me at the new bank. I can't do this anymore. The money is not worth this shit! Karl, you forgot my birthday, and I forgive you. But you are taking me to dinner. Oh, I thought you forgot. Oh, Sue, you ruined the surprise. You ruined it. It's okay. I can act surprised. I can act surprised. Oh, honey, I love the flowers! Thank you so much. I love them. Where are we off to, stud? What in the world? Honey, hurry up! Hey, baby. Oh, I been waiting for you for too long. Coming to get ya. - Hurry up. - Oh, look at you. I got you some flowers. I'm gonna stick those flowers in a vase right here. I am strong. I'm important... I'm important... I'm strong... Hello, dear. Would you like a room? I actually lost my key. My husband and I are in room 14. It's my birthday. And he got me flowers. Men just don't give flowers like they should. Not your husband, though. A true gentlemen. Here you go. Happy birthday, sweetie. Thank you. Get in there! Come on! Work! Deeper. Harder! Karl! - Karl. - Sue? Oh, my God! Karl! Oh, God! - Oh, my God! - Stop it! Stop! Stop it! No, please! I have kids! I have kids. What is your name? - Leah... - Leah. Can you put your tit away? - My tit... my tit. - Put it away. Thank you. Karl... is he okay? Is he okay? Karl... Karl? No, Leah, he's dead. Oh, my God! Oh, my... Stop it! You stop it! I am important. I am strong. I am enough. - Don't you think so, Leah? - Yes. I think so, too. But I don't think Karl thought so, but look at him now. I'm not gonna say anything. Oh, really, that your vagina killed my husband? I don't imagine you will. No, I didn't... Stop it! I'm sorry I hit you. But I'm gonna take care of everything, okay? So here's what I need you to do. I want you to go. Go? Yeah, go on. Get your things and go. I'll take care of it all. Don't forget your bra. Karl, you forgot my birthday. I need to cancel a dinner reservation for two tonight under the name Buttons. My husband isn't feeling well, so we won't be able to make it. Thank you. Karl, what am I gonna do with you? The search continues for 13-year-old Emma Rose who disappeared last... You have been through a month of hell and unspeakable heartbreak, and now the entire world is behind you. How has the local community been? The love they've shown to us is truly remarkable. The letters of encouragement, and people have brought us food. Thank you to Yuba County. Thank you, America. You matter, and your story matters. I'm here to help. I'm Gloria Michaels, and I'm on your side. Coming up next, a Channel Five exclusive. An interview with the obstetrician who delivered Emma Rose. Please... Help me! My husband is missing! Excuse me. Officer? Officer? I need to fill out... - Have a seat. - I'm sorry. Okay. Excuse me... Don't you fucking touch me. Okay, wait a minute. Lawrence, come back here. Yes, ma'am. I don't know Hello, Detective Harris. We got a busload of teen assholes coming in. Will you take him to booking for me? All right, come on daddy's boy, - let's go to jail. - Detective... I'm sorry, how much longer? I... Harris. Detective. I-I need to fill out a missing person report. Okay, well, miss, I don't handle that. But my husband, Karl, he's missing! Well, when was the last time you saw him? Yesterday. All right, so, in situations like this, we recommend checking in with family and friends first. I can't tell you how many times, husbands that go out of town for the weekend, and they don't tell their wives. - But I... - Harris, our bus is here. - Shit. Already? - Yeah. - I know he... - Hey, let me go, huh? Hey, let me go! Who are you? Ma'am, you need to leave. Hey! Hey! Let's go! - What are you gonna do, lady? - Harris! The Gloria Michaels Show.

I am going to report on no other story but yours until we bring Emma Rose back home. A commitment to you. And Emma. (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING Here again is your heartbreaking... Shut up! ...because of how long it's been, but I know that my Emma... Fucking shut up! Shut... I swear to God, Lennie, if I don't get an interview with the Roses. I will lose my shit! Karl! You forgot to put in my loan application! Oh, my God. Sue, what happened? Someone, um, destroyed my house. Do you know who? Sue. Sue? - Oh, Lord. Hey, hey. - I don't... Okay, all right. Oh, boy. Okay. Where's Karl? - He's gone. - What? I woke up this morning and... I think someone took him. Who would take Karl? Uh... - Sue? - I, uh... Okay, did-did... did you call the police? I went... I went to the police, but they wouldn't help. Are you serious? Well, um, do... do you know who maybe would've taken him? I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know! I don't know what to do. The police said wait 48 hours. Maybe he, you know, went out of the town for the weekend. But-but just look at this place. - Look at it! - Uh-huh. Something bad happened. I need people to be looking for Karl now, but nobody knows he's missing, so how can anybody find him if they don't know he's missing? Sue... Let me help you. How? Have you seen the Emma Rose story? Is that the missing girl? Yes. I can do that... for you. I can get the public aware, so they are looking for him just like they are with Emma. Sh-should we go a bigger news station? Like Gloria Michaels? No, Sue. No, we shouldn't. Because they wouldn't give you the attention that you deserve. But I will. Because you're my sister. I'll take care of all of this. - Okay? Okay. - Okay. Hey, Lennie. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just get the crew together. Now. Nancy, we could get in a lot of trouble for this. We'll call the police after we get the shot, okay. - Okay. - Okay. - Ready? - Mm-hm. Great, great, great. Hey. Hi, Sue. Hi. You're gonna do great. - Thank you. - Yeah. You, uh... You sad? Yes. Yeah, you are, aren't you? You feel like crying? Yes. Okay, okay. You should... Okay. Okay, roll. Let's roll. Let's roll. We got it. One, one. One-two, one-two, one-two. Two, one... Local banker Karl Buttons, abducted from his home in what appears to be a violent struggle. Karl's wife, Sue Buttons, woke up early this morning to find her kitchen destroyed and her husband missing. Local police have yet to respond to the incident. Sue... - Hey, babe. - Petey, Karl's in trouble. - What's wrong? - Turn on Channel Two News. Rita, turn the TV's to Channel Two. If you have any information... Do you know these broads? ...on the disappearance of Karl Buttons... Oh, shit, they kidnapped my brother. - Should I get my gun? - Where we'll be... I'll get my gun! Oh, it's go time! Sue, is there anything you want to say to the people? I know you're out there, Karl. I know I'll see you again. Ooh. Okay... This is Nancy Livingston for KTV Two News. You can cut. Sue, you did great. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. - Here they come. - Mm! What the fuck is all this? What the fuck is all what? You say something? Hell nah. Mm... Nancy. KTV Two News. We know. - This is Officer Jones. - Nancy. Mrs. Buttons, uh, usually, in a missing person case people call the police before they call the media. She tried. I was... Mmm-hmm. Uh, may we look around, please? It's just right through here. When was the last time you saw your husband? - Yesterday morning. - Mm. Where's your kitchen? Oh, um, sorry, it's just right though here. Okay. Now be careful, watch your step. It looks like there was some kind of a struggle. I mean, with all this stuff thrown about. That's how I knew something bad had happened. But you said missing, not abducted. What? Oh, I got it from here, thank you. Thank you. Uh, you said missing. This morning at the station, you didn't... you didn't mention a struggle. Well, I tried to tell you. But then all those teenagers came in, and then no one would listen to me. - Hm. - When did you realize your husband was missing? This morning. When I woke up, I realized Karl hadn't come home last night. And then I came down and saw the kitchen and the great room and-and... - And I knew something was wrong. - Mm. You didn't notice the kitchen or the great room last night? No. I... Well, it was my birthday, and we had dinner reservations at La Femme Aimée. That swanky new French restaurant downtown. But I was exhausted when I got home, so I went upstairs to close my eyes for a minute and do some affirmations, and I knew something was wrong 'cause Karl never woke me. And I came downstairs, and then I saw this, and Karl was gone. What'd you say? - "Affirmations?" - Yeah. "You are worthy, you are loved, you are special." Uh, can you think of anyone that that might want to harm your husband? Oh, my goodness, no. I mean, I-I don't think so. Karl was such a sweet man. Why would anyone take him? This is a photo of me and Karl in case you need it for all the press conferences and whatnot. Okay. Great. Yeah, we will do everything we can to find him. Can I get coffee or...? No, no, no. I only take my coffee in the morning. Hey. You see how she kept talking about him in the past tense? She's a little weird, but that woman is definitely not a criminal mastermind. Yeah. What did you do with my brother, man? No bodyguard today, huh, Petey? Fuck! I swear I didn't mean any disrespect. Ow, ow, you guys are so scary. I would never do anything to mess with you. You know this. Thank you. Guys, listen, I know Karl messed up, but he's real sorry, you know, and it's not gonna happen again. So, why don't you just let him go, please? What the fuck are you talking about? Come on. Karl's missing. I know you got him. He's okay, right? You didn't hurt him or anything. Um, we don't... Oh, come on, just tell me what you want. What do you want? What do you want?! Twenty grand. Where am I gonna get 20 grand? That's a personal Petey problem. So, tick-tock. Goddamnit. Looks like I'm about to make some easy cash. We don't have Karl. So? So, where is he? And where's your daddy's money? Whoa. Whoa! Whoa. People don't fear you. He took my money because he thinks he can get away with it. He thinks he can get away with it because he doesn't fear you. Mina, I can't trust you to handle my business if people don't fear you. She's just a girl. I expected more from you. Hey! Oh, hey! Well, hello. Good to see you two again. Steve, Stanlow Banker of the Year. Actually, uh, Karl's not in right now. Hey! Well, I think you two should leave. I'm calling security. Oh, my God. Please, I live with my mother, okay? She's very sick. I have to give her medication. I bathe her. You bathe your... Shut up! - Please don't kill me. - I should. Imagining you bathing your old ass mother. The soap and everything... Nasty. What do you... What would you like? What do you want? Was any money deposited into any of these accounts yesterday? I'd be happy to check account balances for you. Thank you for choosing Stanlow Community Bank for your banking needs. So it would appear that all of these accounts are empty. He took the money. You wouldn't happen to have any idea where your colleague Karl is, would you? No. Uh, he didn't come in for work today. Uh... So, I... I don't know. He's a new team member at this branch, so I'm not too familiar with his schedule yet. What? Uh, no recent activity on any of Karl's credit cards. Last purchase he made was a bouquet of flowers. He buys a bouquet of flowers. He's forcibly taken from his kitchen. Well, where are the flowers? Maybe the kidnappers took them. - Stop it. - Okay. Or maybe he never made it back home. Knock, knock. We got a body. - Karl? - No. But the body was found in his office. - Shit. - Yeah. Here's the surveillance footage you requested. And screenshots with all the people who Steve was last seen with. Missing banker Karl and dead banker Steve. There are a lot of bad things happening to the bankers at your bank. And this is the picture you give me? We've never had any trouble here. So, updating the surveillance system wasn't cost effective. Let's see if Steve agrees. Come in here. Hey, Steve, do you agree? Nope. Steve doesn't agree. Because Steve is dead! And this shitty image won't help us catch the people who killed him! I'm sorry. Don't apologize to me. Apologize to Steve. Come here. He can't hear you from there. I'm sorry, Steve. You matter. Your story is important. Miss Michaels. May I help you? My name is Sue Buttons. And I want to give you an exclusive story to play on the news. Well, you can drop off any potential stories at the front desk. I'd love to talk with you. You can drop off any potential stories at the front desk. It's a missing person story. Is it a missing child? No, it's my husband. Karl Buttons. My assistant will take your story and your information. If you follow me up to the front I can take your information. Thirteen-year-old Emma Rose is... Emma Rose. What? She's the reason my husband is missing. Karl figured out who took Emma Rose. He was gonna tell the police, and I think that's why he was taken. I think if you help me find Karl... we'll find Emma. And you're sure he said the name Emma Rose? Yes. That morning, he made me breakfast, and while we were eating he said, "I know who took Emma Rose." Why didn't you immediately call the police? I didn't think anything of it. I... I don't watch TV, so I hadn't heard about poor Emma Rose. I only heard her name when I was in your station today, and that's when I put two and two together. Even if you didn't know who Emma Rose was, if one of my husbands says to me he knows who took somebody, anybody, you better believe I'm gonna ask questions. I know, and I-I so wish I had, but you-you have to understand, Gloria, my husband... He's a... conspiracy theorist. He's always saying things like he knows who killed JonBenét Ramsey and he knows who kidnapped Natalee Holloway. Is there a link. between the disappearance of Sue's husband Karl, and the disappearance of 13-year-old Emma Rose. Uh, ma'am. Do you know if a Peter Buttons works here? Are you stealing from me? Hey... Hey, Rita. This ain't what it looks like. Um... After all I did for you? Are you stealing from me? Rita, Rita... Rita! Fuck you! Oh! Fuck you. But real talk, - you stealing from me? - Hmm. Hey, Rita! The police is here. Looking for the felon. Shit. What? What did I tell you? What's going on back here? - Nothing. - Uh, nothing. Nothing. You tell the officers he'll be right out. Come on, Rita, you called the cops? Look, I am sorry, but I need money to pay Karl's ransom. And I was gonna pay you back. I swear. Hey, I'm no rat. Then why are they here? Have you committed any other crimes lately? Can I help you? - Peter Buttons? - Yeah, Petey. We're here about Karl. His wife reported him missing. Yes. Yeah, uh, I saw that on the news. Well, when was the last time you spoke to Karl? Um, I want to say a week or two. - You know... - Mm. Which is it? You want to say it, or you're saying it? I'm saying it. Okay, okay. You and Karl close? Well, yeah, he's... He's my brother, so... But you haven't talked to him in a week or two? Well, no, I've-I've been busy with work, and I'm having twins. Can you think of someone who might want to harm your brother? No. No, no. Is there anything else? 'Cause I do... I gotta get back to work. Well, we're trying to find your brother. Yeah, of course. Whoa, check this out. Somebody turn that up! I know, and I so wish I had, but you have to understand, Gloria, my husband... He's a conspiracy theorist. He's always saying things like he knows who killed JonBenét Ramsey, and he knows who kidnapped Natalee Holloway. Well, it looks like we won't need to hold that press conference. When was the last time you talked to your sister-in-law? Sue's... Well, she's kinda quiet. We don't talk that much. He knew something. Give me a call if you remember anything else. ...between the disappearance of Sue's husband Karl... - Last thing. - Yes? What was Karl's favorite conspiracy theory? What? Call me if you hear something, all right? Okay. Congratulations on those twins! - Thank you very much. - It's a lot of work. Sure is. Hey, kid, sorry about your brother getting kidnapped. I can't believe the same people who took Emma Rose also took your brother. I mean, what a crazy coincidence. No, Rita. Mina and Ray have taken Karl hostage and are holding him for ransom, okay. Oh, yeah, that makes more sense. Where am I gonna get 20 grand? I guess we gonna have to steal it. Fuck. Roberta? Janet? Hey. We saw you on Gloria Michaels. I'm so sorry about Karl. So sorry. You're not alone. So not. I made you chicken tetrazzini. I know it's hard, but you have to remember to eat. Yummy. Poor thing. So brave. Sue. Hi, Jonelle. Oh, my goodness. When did this happen? Hello in there. I'm your Aunt Sue. You know, I never heard Karl talk about JonBenét Ramsey, Natalee Holloway. Why Emma Rose? Oh... Well, you and Petey don't visit us much, so it's not surprising that we don't know what's happening in each other's lives. Did Karl walk out on you? Excuse me? Karl isn't the guy who gets kidnapped because he cracked a missing girl case. He's the guy who runs off on his wife and disappears to start a new life. And if your husband of 30 years just up and walks out on you one day, I can understand faking a kidnapping to save face. Better a missing husband than a deadbeat one, right? If anything ever happened to Petey... - Mm-hmm. - ...I would be supporting you through the worst moment in your life. But I suppose we have different ideas on what it means to be family. Petey is my family. Okay. And he has finally gotten his life together. He is on a good path and I refuse to let this throw him off. If this whole kidnapping thing is fake, then, Sue, you need to come clean. You're hormonal, so I'll forgive the insult. You matter, and your story matters. If you are just joining us, I am here with Sue Buttons. Is there a link between the disappearance of Sue's husband Karl, and the disappearance... ...of 13-year-old Emma Rose? And you're sure you heard him say the name Emma Rose? How could you do this to me? - What? - You gave the story to Gloria Michaels? Sue, this was my story. Nancy, my husband is missing. This isn't just a story. Unbelievable. How are you holding up? - I'm okay. - Mm. My friend Janet made this for me. - Well, that's nice. - Mm-hm. That was nice of her. Is there anything I can do to help? I'm just happy you're here. Oh. Sue, of course. Do you remember when you were little and you would hold my hand when I would walk you to school? And you would squeeze it so tight whenever we walked by a dog because you were sure they were all out to get you. And then one day I was dropping you off, and Shelley Davis said, "Your big sister is not pretty." And you said, "Yeah, she's just my half-sister." And then you stopped holding my hand. Hello? Yes, this is Sue Buttons. ...Emma Rose. Why didn't you immediately call the police? I didn't think anything of it. I... Tomorrow's fine with me. I don't watch TV, so I hadn't heard about poor Emma Rose. I only heard her name when I was in your station today, and that's when I... I put two and two together. Even if you didn't know who Emma Rose... Hey, Sue. Didn't you know who Emma Rose was? What? Before you went to Gloria Michaels, when you and I were together, you called her "the missing girl." That was Emma Rose's parents on the phone. Wow. Wait, what... What did they want? They-they want to meet me... to talk. Okay, I know what to do. We're-we're gonna do a joint interview while there's still buzz about a possible connection between Karl and Emma. I... I don't know. Sue, the media is your best friend right now. The bigger the story, the bigger the chances of finding Karl and Emma. Okay. Yes! Ooh! Yes, yes, yes! Okay, I'm gonna do the whole thing, and we're gonna solve this together. Go ahead! Go, Petey! Come on, Petey, let's go! Ooh, I'm a criminal! Oh, man! Shh! Stop making sounds! We're gonna be dead if you don't shut up! - Come on, Petey! - Stop saying my name! Whoo! I feel so alive! Let's do it again, Petey! Hi, there. Hi. What can I get you? I want a new TV. Do I know you from somewhere? You look very familiar. I'm Sue. Sue-Sue Buttons. Oh, my God, yes! Oh, bless your heart. Your husband Karl was kidnapped. That's right. I want to make love to this bag of bling. We should keep some for our ladies. Deb would have sex with me so hard if I gave her a diamond. No, come on. You can't keep the shit you steal. That's how they catch you, okay? Karl and I would watch TV together every morning, and our TV was destroyed during the abduction. And I just want something to go back to normal. Do you think I'm crazy? Oh, no. Not at all. I can't imagine what you're going through. I tell you, if anybody ever hurt my Rita, I would stab 'em right in the heart. Now let's get you a TV. Okay. Okay. This looks like at least 20 grand, right? So I'll set a drop, I'll give them the jewels, I'll get Karl. Everything will be back to normal in the end. Just put that shit away, please. Petey? Order's going out. Shit, it's Sue. What is she doing here? Have you talked to her yet? What do you want me to say? "Hey, it's been awhile. By the way, I'm the reason your husband got kidnapped. Well, I wouldn't lead with that. But you can tell her we're handling things. Poor thing looks so sad on TV. Just put that shit away, please. I'm gonna get you some hard sex too, Petey. Hey, Sue! Peter, what are you doing here? I work here now. Let me give you a hand. I got it. How are you holding up with everything, huh? Not great. - I'm gonna get Karl back. - What? How? I mean... Do you know where he is? No, I don't know where he is. Or who took him or why or anything. - Do you know anything? - No, I don't know anything. Me neither. I don't know anything. But I just want you to know that I am... handling it. I'm gonna get Karl back. Hey! Uh, we're looking for Karl. Karl is missing. Oh. Do you have any idea where he's gone missing to? No. Who-who-who are you? You don't know where Karl is? No. Are you sure? Yes. Where'd you get the money, uh, to buy this? I used, uh, my credit card. I got a five percent discount. You can... You can have it. Please. Come on in here. We want to find Karl. Me, too. Do you, um... want us to help you find Karl? What? Yes. All right. We'll help you find Karl. Are you afraid? Yes. Yes. All right... And you'll call us if you hear from Karl, right? Okay. - Hey. - Look at me. - How you holding up? - I'm good. You seem a little, uh, jumpy. Donna, she's fine. She looks great. She's fine. Thank you. Bye-bye. We're gonna do this together, okay? - Lennie! Get the damn door! - Okay, okay. I don't want to do this anymore. No, no, no, no. Sue, Sue. Don't do this to me. Not now, Sue. Sue, you said that Karl knew who took Emma. Listen, we'll get to all of that when-when the cameras are rolling. Why don't you mic 'em, Lennie, okay? Thank you. Sue, hi. Are you gonna be on the news again today? Who's that? I don't know, but she fine as hell. Quality Times Motel. Ring a bell? Sue? Are you okay? She's an old friend. Yes. I'll be right back. Excuse me. No, Sue. I'm begging you. Sue, I'm begging you... I said I'll be right back! I'll be back. I'm sorry. Can we just talk outside a minute? I'd love that. Okay. - What are you doing here? - Where's the money? What money? Maybe I go on the news, too. Tell them what really happened to Karl. - No, no, no. - Get your hands off me. I can tell everyone about Karl. - So don't fuck with me! - Hey! I'm sorry, but I'm sure you're forgetting that you don't know anything about Karl. Maybe I go to the police. Don't you forget, I'm doing you a favor. Or do you want the world and your kids to know it was your poisonous vagina that killed my husband. I don't think you do. So, as I said, you know nothing about Karl. I don't have any kids. My husband does, but fun fact, I don't care what his kids think. I will tell your husband. Go right ahead. He's away on business, but I can give you his number. You can tell him how you caught us cheating, how Karl died, how you did something with his body, and then reported him missing. I'll get a divorce, and you'll go to jail. I am important. I am strong. I am enough! Don't you think so, Sue? I want that money. I swear these White bitches are crazy. Hi, Mina. This is Sue. I think I know someone who can help you find Karl. Her name is Leah. And she drives a white Mercedes. License plate one-three-Y... ...Quebec, Tango, three. Detective Harris. - Hey. - Hi. How are you? Have you had a break in the case? Not yet. I'm just checking in. I'm sick with worry, but I'm holding up okay. I mean, the community has been really supportive. Yeah. Who's the lady you were talking to? An old friend. That didn't look like a friendly conversation. Well, she hasn't made the time to show her support like others have. My friend Janet, she made me a casserole. Oh, I love a casserole. I shouldn't have snapped at her. It's just, I can't expect everyone to drop their lives and rush to my aid because my husband is missing. Yeah. So listen, do you have any new information for me? Hm? Or am I gonna have to find it out on the news tonight - with the rest of the world? - Oh. Nothing new, unfortunately. We're just doing everything we can to raise awareness. I-I should probably get back inside, but thank you for stopping by, Detective Harris. When did you eat the cake? I'm sorry? You said you didn't have time to celebrate your birthday that night, and when you woke up, Karl was gone, so... When did you eat the cake? I... You know... I guess Karl must've snuck a piece before he was taken. Detective Harris... Please find my husband, and bring him home. I just want my husband back. I'll do all I can, all right, Mrs. Buttons? Thank you, Detective. Mr. and Mrs. Rose, please! - What's going on? - We can't do this. We just want our little girl back. They lost their nerve waiting on you. I needed this interview! I'm sorry, but Detective Harris came by to check in. We can still do the interview. No, we can't. We can't do the interview without the Roses. The Roses were the hook! No one wants to watch just you! Sue, Sue! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. That was... That was really stupid of me to say. Listen, let's just... Let's just do the interview, okay? No. It's okay. I think it would be best for me to do my interviews with Gloria Michaels anyway. She'll reach a larger audience... for Karl. Fuck. Thank you for coming. I won't be filming today. So, you can let yourselves out. Thank you. You are powerful. You are strong. You don't need the Roses. I just had... Where's the "W"? Upside-down. It looks like... Apparently, a ransom note was sent to the wife of Karl Buttons demanding $50,000 for his return. Karl was reported missing yesterday morning by his wife, Sue. Who are you, Leah Norton? - No, thank you for calling. - Okay. - Thanks so much. - Yeah. Yeah, I got The numbers came in from the bank. Missing banker Karl's been up to no good. He's been laundering money through the bank for months now. And this was taken the day Karl went missing. - Hm. - The guys that killed Steve definitely met with Karl the day he disappeared. All right, I don't need a gold star, but I think we can both admit this is a major break. - Harris. - Oh, hey, Captain Riggins. Have you been following Sue Buttons? Sitting outside her house? I've been working my case. By harassing the victim's wife? Her sister's a reporter. We do not need more bad press. Okay... Captain. She canceled dinner reservations the night that Karl disappeared. Who cancels dinner plans unless you know your husband isn't gonna be there? And-and then there's the cake. Cake and dinner reservations? That's your evidence? - Captain... - Officer Jones, do you share Detective Harris' feeling? Well, I definitely think Mrs. Buttons is strange. But, no, I don't think she has anything to do with her husband's disappearance. Right now, our strongest lead is the bank. Karl was laundering money, and he's somehow connected to these men that we believe killed Steve Perkins. And that is actual evidence. - Sue... - Stand down, Harris. Or you're off the case. Captain Riggins, your wife is here to see you. Fuck. Look, right now, I just think we need to focus on the bank and see where it goes. I am the senior officer on this case, okay. You back me up! Petey. Hey, Rita. I can see the bag. Are you trying to sneak off to this ransom drop without me? I thought we were partners. Look, they told me to come alone, all right. Everyone knows that you're supposed to pretend to go alone but actually bring backup to wait nearby in case something goes down. That's ransom drop 101. Look, I can close up while... No! Rita! You're not coming! This is not a game. - Fine. - All right. You're not coming. Well, at least take my gun. No. I'm not taking a gun. You mean to tell me you gonna go to a ransom drop - with no backup and no gun? - Yeah. What a dumbass. Police! Ms. Norton? Anybody home? Hey. Where's your mama, little baby? Huh? She in here? Jesus Christ. Well, that's a lot of dicks. Ugh! Quality Times Motel? Well, you're a dirty girl, aren't you, Ms. Norton. We don't got time for this. Took you long enough. I'm sorry. We were just about to go kill Karl. - Oh, no. Don't do that. - You got the money? Yeah, right here. What the fuck is this? That's gotta be worth at least 20 grand. - Probably more. - Is that an opal? Yes, ma'am. It's the best I could do on such short notice. - All right. - Please. You know what? I'm feeling hospitable. I'll take it. So you're gonna let Karl go now? Obviously. Yeah. That-that's how ransom works. You know what ransom is, right? I do know how it works and what it means. Thank you. Easiest 20 grand I have ever made. Now maybe you can focus on getting your daddy's millions back. Can you, uh, not kill my vibe? It's a good day. It's a good day. Don't you think it's a good day? No? That's too bad. 'Cause I'm having a really good day. Hey, Dad. I got a present for you. It's the mistress. The wife put us onto her. Please, tell Sue I'm sorry. Where's Karl? I won't tell anyone about Karl. I promise. What do you know about Karl?! I don't know anything! Wait, wait, wait! What do you want me to say? I will say whatever you want me to say! Please. Cut off her fingers. No! Wait! Wait! Holy, holy, holy shit! Why are you doing this? We don't have any money. Karl was actually kidnapped. - Please, let him go. - He was actually kidnapped. No, don't touch me! Don't touch me! No! Just tie her to the chair. Thank you for coming, I... It means a lot to me. I'm so sorry. I'm so... I'm weak with exhaustion, and I need to go inside and pray. Mmm. Look how they capture the emotion. Please continue to pray for Karl. Thank you. What does she want? Answer this door! Yes, Detective Harris? Where is she? Who? I saw you arguing with her, and now she's gone. Where is she? I don't know what you're talking about. You need to come down to the station with me. Am I under arrest? Then I am not going down to the police station with you. - Turn around. - What? Put your hands behind your back. I'm detaining you for questioning in the disappearing of Karl Buttons and Leah Norton. You're gonna regret this, Detective Harris. - Oh, yeah? Fuck you. - Ow. Okay. Sue, I'm real sorry. I forgot your birthday. That was really shitty of me. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Oh, my purse. Aren't you gonna read me my rights? You have the right to shut the fuck up. - These are really pinching. - Good. - Ow, ow, ow, ow! - Just get inside. Hello. Hey. Lennie, did you get the video I sent you? In the two seconds since you sent it to me? No. All right, hold on. Let me look. You have the right to shut the fuck up. - Oh, my God. - Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! - Why was Sue arrested? - Do what I say, and tip off Gloria Michaels. Wait, you-you wanna give away our lead? Just do it. - Load up. - Right now? We're eating lunch. Load up! Do your damn job. They told me they let him go. I told you, you should've brought my gun. You can't go to a ransom drop without a gun. - They lied! - Bad guys lie, Petey. Rain is wet. Shit stinks. What else is obvious? All right, that's it. I'm going to the police. You can't do that. I should've gone to them in the first place. Well, yeah, you should, but you didn't. And if you go to the police now, they're gonna have a lot of questions. Like, where'd you get the 20,000 to pay the first ransom? Well, I can't just do nothing, Rita. I never said we were gonna do nothing. - Hmm? - An eye for an eye, Petey. An eye for an eye. Can you step out of the way, honey? Let's set up right here. We'll need you to clear. Oh, my God. That's fucking Gloria Michaels. You know what, I get it. He was cheating on you. With Leah. But you knew that. You knew that You're the kind of woman, you could accept an affair. Well, until you couldn't. It was your birthday, and he bought flowers for some other bitch. I'da killed him too. I woulda grabbed him by his baby dick, got my gun, and I woulda shot him up the piss hole. What is this shit? Channel Five? Damn news people. Detective Harris, why did you arrest Sue Buttons? Do you think she had something to do with the disappearance of her husband, Karl. Gloria, I don't... I don't know why this is happening to me. I've done nothing wrong. Help me, Ms. Michaels. Miss Buttons... Please, Ms. Michaels, help me. Detective Harris, what charges is she facing? Would you stay off my ass, Reggie? Jesus! Harris! - Harris! - No. - What are you doing? - No! Okay. Now tell me what happened the night of your birthday. I think every station was there. You said you fell asleep as soon as you got home. Yes. But I know you called La Femme Aimée, and you canceled your dinner reservation later that night. Oh, uh, yes. I must have called before I fell asleep. Then why'd you cancel your dinner reservations? I suppose because we weren't having dinner anymore. When we questioned you, you said, "It was my birthday, and we had dinner reservations. But I must have fallen asleep, because then it was morning and I knew something was wrong because Karl never woke me. Yes. But now you're saying you weren't going to dinner. - So which is it? - What? Well, were you going to dinner or weren't you going to dinner? Mrs. Buttons? You're-you're trying to confuse me. Truth is never confusing. My husband is missing. There are no cameras in here, Sue. I don't want to talk to you. This is... This is harassment. Harris! Captain, I'm in the middle - of an interrogation. - Now. I told you to stand down! Captain, uh... I have her. Just give me 20 minutes. I've got Gloria fucking Michaels on our doorstep. She-she killed her husband and Leah Norton. - Who? - Leah Norton. I saw her arguing with her in the yard yesterday. And-and-and I traced her license plates, I went to her house, and she's gone. Her car is in the driveway. Her stove is on. The-the purse, the keys, everything. It's there, but she's gone. And I think she was having an affair with Karl. I think Sue found out, and I think that she's done something with her. Does she have a dog? Is it possible she was walking her dog, or buying milk, or any other fucking thing, minding her own goddamn business, while you were performing an illegal and unauthorized search of her home?! - Captain... - You are off the case. No, Captain, she killed her husband! Mrs. Buttons. I have your purse. I know I'm right, Jones. I think you believe you're right. When your partner believes they're right... you trust it. Good luck. Fuck, Petey. Scream and you're dead. I'll make a brief statement. Mrs. Buttons is not, and has never been, considered a suspect in her husband's disappearance. Captain Riggins, why was Sue brought into your station in handcuffs? This has all been a misunderstanding. Now, we don't wanna hurt you. Well, you're gonna die tonight! - You're gonna die tonight! - You're gonna die tonight! - Nobody's dying tonight! - You're gonna die! - Just... - Hey, hey, hey, hey! We're just gonna call the boss. Make an even exchange. So everybody just chill out! Yeah, yeah. Chill out! Or I'll chill you out. You're not gonna do shit, old lady. - Holy shit! - Oh, my fucking ear! - You shot my fucking ear off! - Oh, shit! Take this. Talk to him. - I'll keep her quiet. - I'm... We have your daughter. - Mina? - Release your hostage. Mina! Or we will kill her. Oh, I'm gonna rip your fucking throat... Next time, it's gonna be your face! Goddamnit. I gotta go. Jonelle. - What you mean you gotta go? - I gotta go. Jonelle's in labor! Would you mind if I held onto this? Yes! I do mind! Okay. You know, you are right. This belongs to you. This is yours... Who do you work for? - What? - Her people have Mina. What? No! I don't have any people. I... Where's my daughter? Who do you work for?! What are you doing? No! Where is my daughter? It was Sue! Karl's wife! She killed Karl, and she took your money. - Sue has my money? - There was a bag full of money! Karl said it was three million dollars. And she has my daughter? Karl's idiot brother, Petey. Mina told him we had Karl. I should have stopped her. I told you I don't have people! I have kids! I have kids! Please! Me, too. - Jonelle! Hey! - Hey. Hey. I'm here. You okay? Let's go! I made eggplant parm. Wait. What is going on? You said you were in labor. Oh, yeah. I lied. - What? - I lied. Sit down, baby. We should really eat this before it gets cold. Jesus Christ, Jo, what's... Now we're both liars. Now, what do you mean by that? What do I mean by that? Fucking Rita. Petey, get out! Okay, wait. Please. Listen, you can have me, the babies, homemade eggplant parm, or you can have your stealing and your secrets, and your scary bad guys, - but you can't have both. - They have Karl! - What? - Ray and Mina kidnapped Karl, and I needed the money to pay his ransom. Baby, they have my brother. And they wouldn't if it weren't for me. I care about you. I care about the twins. I care about our family. I don't care about Karl. Petey, what do you care about? You have reached Rita's cellular phone. Please leave a message. Hey, Rita. Give me a call back when you get this, I think... It's time we went to the police. So in a shootout, do you look at what you're shooting at, or do you just close your eyes and hope you hit something? Oh, I gotta... Don't move. Next time, try saving me before they shoot my fucking ear off! We gotta take care of Petey. Your daddy wants you to go home. - I'm gonna take care of Petey. - Fuck no! You've caused enough problems for one day. Go home. - No! - Stay here if you want. You're not coming with me. Stop being dumb, dude. Put that out. Don't worry, I won't set us on fire. Grow up. Why? Rita... My Rita. Shut it. All this trouble for 20 grand. How could she think I could do such terrible things? I'll give you a ride home. Oh, no, it's okay. My sister's here. Captain Riggins? Thank you. You came for me. Yeah, of course. Sue... I knew the captain would let you go once Gloria Michaels arrived. Why are we stopping? What are you doing? What happened to Karl? I know. Sue, if you did something, I can help you. - What? - But I need to know what happened. I need to know everything. Wow. Wow. You know, you're-you're a real piece of work, Nancy. You were miked. What are you talking about? - Where's the money? - What money? Maybe I go on TV, too. Tell them what really happened to Karl. - No, no, no, no, no. - Get your hands off me. I found this when I was going through the audio. I can tell everyone about Karl. So don't fuck with me! You must be mistaken. Fucking damn it. Sue, please. - Let me go! - Sue. Sue! Sue, where are you going? Why are you doing this to me? Because I want to help you! I don't need you to tell my story! I don't want to tell your story! I just want to be your sister! We can still fix this. Sue, but first, you gotta stop talking to the press. Oh. There it is. There what is? You're mad because I didn't invite you to my press conference. Oh, my God, Sue. This is serious. - You can go to jail for this. - You're jealous because everyone's paying attention to me now. You're jealous because I'm the more popular sister now. Oh, my God, do you hear how crazy you sound? I hope a dog bites you in the face. Real nice. Sue. Sue. Oh, my God! Open the door! Nancy, go away! Real nice, Sue. Open the fucking door! Please, I want to help you. Nancy, please, just go away. Come on. Hi, Nancy. Why don't you stay? Where's my money? What money? You mistake me for a patient man. I will ask you once more, and you will not make the same mistake. Karl took my money, where is it? Sue... Sue, tell him the truth. Karl's missing. I... Shut up! Shut up! - Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! - Fuck! - Wait! Wait! - Shut up! Wait! I'll tell you where Karl is! I know where he is! I'll tell you. My sister has nothing to do with this. You leave her out of it. You hear me? Oh, fuck! Please, just let her go, and I'll tell you. - Oh, my God! - Please, just let her go. Sue... I'm so sorry, Nancy. Harris. You following me? Yeah. Just hang on. Hey. Look... I haven't had your back. And I'm sorry. Look, I trust your instincts as... I ain't got time for apologies. Officer Jones. You coming? Get out. Shovel. - Where? - It's over there. Go. Would you two like a room? No, um, we're here about an investigation. - Oh. - Do you recognize any of these people? Oh, goodness. I'm not too good with faces. Not like my Charlie was. Why, he could remember a face from way, way... Okay. So this would've been from three nights ago. Let me see. Well, if you say they were here, then I suppose I must have seen them. Sorry, Harris. Yeah. Can I see your security footage? Security footage? Oh, goodness, yeah. This is not funny. Rita, call me back. What do I always say? - Maybe you should just go. - "Batter matters." I don't know, something isn't right. - ...it's all about the egg. - I know. See how deep-yellow these yolks are? I'm gonna be straight with you. The paler the egg yolk, the better the chances are that egg came from a chicken who was cooped up. I'm sorry. Maybe we just don't get to be normal. Let me go find Rita. I'll be right back. Okay. I will. Be right back. Okay. Oh, my... Shit! Baby, please pick up. He's not quite one year old, and he weighs about 24 pounds. Which makes handling this adorable puppy... No, charge. It comes with the couch. TVs. You gotta eat. No credit, no... Baby, pick up! I'm fucking pregnant! Asshole! We're gonna have twins! And we're gonna get married! And we're gonna be happy! Look. That's Sue! - We got her! - No, you got her. Fuck yeah, I did! - Come on. Let's go. - All right. Hey, pretty girl! We got her! Thank you, ma'am. - Thank you so much. - Yeah. My goodness, you... Y'all have a good night. - Have a good night. - Yeah, you too. Bye-bye. That's a murder investigation. - All right, I'll see you there. - Okay. Hey. Come on. Jonelle! Baby! Hey. Hey, hey, hey. We're gonna get out of here. We are gonna move away, and we are gonna be happy. I promise you. Come here... You could be famous as the man who found Karl Buttons. We could... we could be on the news together. The bag. Oh, my God. I... I didn't know. Back in the hole. I-I can help you. I can... I can tell your story. Wouldn't you like that? No thanks. No, no, no! No! Please, don't! - Police! - Drop it! - Drop your fucking gun! - Drop your weapon! - Jones! - I'm sorry. Don't move! Drop your shovel. Drop your shovel! Please, I... I'm sorry about your partner. Get on your fucking knees, and put your hands above your head! I... You saved me. I'm gonna tell them you saved me at the... at the next press conference. No more press conferences for you, Sue! No, no, no... No, no. No, no, no, no. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't mean for any of this to happen. I didn't. I'll tell everyone that you saved me, and you'll be famous and no one will forget you. Fuck you. My story matters. I am enough. I am confident. My life is unfolding beautifully. This is Channel Five with breaking news. Thirteen-year-old Emma Rose was found alive and well today at a bus stop in Miami, Florida. Her relieved family says she had apparently run away from home. It was a weekend of horror for Sue Buttons. A weekend of chaos and loss. A weekend many of us in her position would not have survived. But you did survive. And you had the courage to share your story. A year ago, I lived through the worst three days of my life. I lost my husband. I thought my life was over. But through my daily affirmations, I was able to find my inner strength to keep going. And I wanted to give that power to others. So I wrote a book. A New York Times best-selling book. Take Your Life Back. America, I'd like you to meet my friend, Sue Buttons. Hello, America. It's nice to meet you. Now, you have a quote on the cover of this book that says, "If you make them see you, they will finally look." Tell me about that. That's right. That quote is so special to me. It came to me in a dream. Dreams are so important. I'm writing a book. I made that decision right now. It's called Dreamscape. - I love it. - It's like escaping. - Yes. That's lovely. - Yeah. I'm gonna say this right here and now. I think I have another book in me. So perhaps we can go on a book tour together. - Oh... - I haven't thought of my title yet. It might be Continue Taking Your Life... Back? Oh, yes, of course. Of course. Back. Take Your Life Back. Continue Taking Your Life Back. You're so brave.
