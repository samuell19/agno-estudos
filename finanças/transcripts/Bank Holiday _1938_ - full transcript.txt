Subtitles by Nostromo Mr. Howard? Wouldn't it be better if you went home? No I'd rather wait. There's no further news yet - How long will it be? - Not for some time, I'm afraid. I'd rather wait. -Can I get you a cup of tea? -No thanks. Nurse Would you.. Would you give my wife a message? Of course. What do you want me to say? Would you tell her that... Just give her my love That's all I suppose you have fellows like me often Making exactly the same fuss - It must happen every day. - Yes But they don't all try to burn down the hospital I am terribly sorry! I do hope it hasn't left a mark. You know,Mr Howard, I love nursing your wife And she's told me such a lot about you I hope it hasn't been too bad. - Well, not too bad. - What did she say? That you work too hard and you smoke too much. But you never know which is your own toothbrush You must come and see us when it's all over. You'll be able to laugh at me of making such a fool of myself I shan't laugh at you. I can just imagine how you feel Are you married? No - Engaged? - Yes. At least... - So you know all about being in love? - Oh yes. I suppose I'm old-fashioned I still think it's the most important thing in life. And the only sane thing I mean when it's real,not that sort of thing you read about. Yes, I think that too But perhaps we are not old enough to know. Perhaps when we're old and Grey, we'll be disillusioned. No,I don't think so. Besides, I feel old and Grey now And you soon will be if you go on worrying like this. We'll need Dr. Connor. -Yes,Doctor -Will you get him at once,do you? Nurse,will you roll the patient to the theater,we have to operate. Sorry. He brought you some flowers. And he asked me to give you his love. I'm glad you expected anything I mean,you weren't disappointed? Not a bit.He's awfully nice, isn't he? Perhaps I exaggerated by telling you he was so good looking But well I think he's pretty good looking - Don't you? - Yes, quite good looking Now, Mrs. Howard, come on. It's not so bad really -What chances she's got Doctor? - Very little I'm afraid Child will be all right though. I'm sorry for the husband. Yes,why do not you knock off? You want to get away,don't you? Yes, but I must see the case through. Where are you going for the holiday? Oh,only to Bexborough. - With the family? - No, just with friends. Oh,the same friend that waits for you every evening? Yes, doctor, exactly the same. I don't understand you young people nowadays. - Why do not you get married? - It's not easy you know what my salary is. - Sure that's the young man's worry - His isn't much better. - What does he do? - He works in an office. Besides we both have to help at home. Well I suppose you know your own business best After all, we can't wait forever. Besides you never know what is going to happen in the world nowadays You got to try to be happy while you can. I'm afraid we were born 20 years too early, sister. Speak for yourself, Doctor.

We'll stay right where we are But you'll be caught if the inspector comes round Listen Do you think I would take you a third on an occasion like this? Darling, I wish you would inform me and not pushing me about Sorry. Did you actually get first class tickets,darling? I thought it would be please you - I don't know wherever I do any wrong - No,Geoff,it was sweet of you. - Don't be bad tempered. What's the matter? - It's not me,Cath,it's you. You have not been the bit of yourselves since the moment we first met And I thought after hanging about all that time for you You would not even kiss me properly,until I asked you too. Oh, Geoff, I did it. It's all turning out so different from what I expected. You don't seem a bit thrilled or pleased that we are going together at last I know,Geoff, but the case upset me. The girl died. I am sorry. I ought to caught knowledge about something like that I suppose I'm selfish, but you know how it is, Cath. I've been looking forward for this for months now I don't know about you but I have thought of anything else for weeks past I saved up every penny so we could stay somewhere decent, because I want to give you a really grand time, Cath. Gosh,I'm happy to be alone with you. Just think The whole weekend to forget the hospital, the office and everything. Just to think of our two souls Now it worries me that the work at the hospital is so hard for you. I think it's marvelous the way you stick it.But I promise... Cath, you're not listening. Just only in my world. I heard every word you said. You were thinking of something else. No I wasn't I didn't half had a business with mother and dad. I told them that I was going camping with a chap from the office. They believed you? I think so. Except just as I was at the door dad said it was funny to go camping with these clothes - You think they suspected? - Who cares anyway? Would they get a shock if they could see me at that biggest hotel in Bexborough tonight. Geoff,you haven't yet told me when you stayed in a big hotel before? Are you sure it wasn't with some girl I haven't heard about? My word of honor. I might be the only chap in the office who has done etcetera Really? Cath, I did not mean it like that. It's just that I'm so worked up about everything Do you think that you are doing this for me? Geoff,what on earth are you talking about? - I wouldn't come if I didn't want to. - I know. But when I think what people would say about you... Do you mind what they say? It's not for me to mind if you don't Geoff,we been over these scores of times. You know my opinion. You know I think we're justified Of course, when... when two people love each other Cath, you do love me? What's that? Is Nurse Catherine there? Just a minute - Hello. - Nurse Catherine. I want to accept your offer after all. You're right. It is impossible for me to stay in the flat alone Nurse Catherine left some time ago. I am sorry. And so you see, he left it on the table. You never told me anything about the husband before - Yes, I did. - You didn't You said it was a difficult case and the girl died. Don't be silly,Geoff.Of course I told you. - What do you want to keep the lighter for? - I don't want to keep it. I just put it in my bag so I can give it back to him So that you could meet him again? Send it back then You really are being ridiculous,Geoff. Don't spoil everything by quarreling,please Now you've got to stop thinking about this darn case. You'll never make a good nurse until you realize you got to take these things as all part of the business I'm not going to spoil the holiday by quarreling All right, I'll try not to think of it any more - No,not try, promise. - Promised, then. That's the girl,Cath Now everything is going to go to be OK and we are going to have a marvelous time - Geoff,did you book at the hotel ? - No - Aren't you to have? - Oh,no,not at a place like the Grand. Besides, Bexborough won't be as full as all that Aren't we not to unpack and walk down to the hall(?) and listen to the band shall we? Look, Geoff!There's the Grand. It's all right, is it? No no.Wait for the commissioner - How much is that? - Half crown, sir. Thank you. Do I call you over? I don't know. You said you've been to a big hotel before. -Cath -Hm We ought to pretend we're married. Geoff, I haven't got a ring. I've got one.The third finger of the left hand,isn't it?

Daddy is coming! What I say is,dear,you should never have let your fiance know that you cared. Don't be silly, Milly. What are you talking about? It's what Aunt Mabel advises in Betty's Own. A girl should never let a man know she cares for him... until after the marriage. It is a cheat,isn't it? You wait until Jack sees my picture in the papers. "Miss England, Doreen Richards." He'd wish he hadn't left me in such a hurry then. That's right. You just you show him If I do win, Mill...,oh but I must I feel like somebody. I now think Jack has made me feel like nobody. Doreen, you? Nobody? Well,if you are a nobody, every ? can not be Thank you dear You know, Mill, when he sent me that letter saying everything was over I said to myself,I said "There's only one thing to be done." "I must pretend I never met him." Doreen, you're wonderful! You are much to good for any man, that's what it is Still I think I'd rather be jilted by a nice boy... than never to had a nice boy at all Poor old Mill, haven't you ever had a man's arms around you? Well,dear,don't tell anyone,I'm telling you I haven't. Of course I'd thought about it a lot and imagined it. I don't suppose I ever shall,no really Poor old Mill. Phew!It's hot. I think we'd better go. They want to close and we haven't got our rooms yet. Our parcels! I'm terrified I leave my swimming suit somewhere. - I could not compete without it. - Supposing you did! - How are your feet now,dear? -Lovely, I can't feel them at all. I think it will be romantic, don't you Cath? Just you and I. What are you laughing at? I am so sorry. Cheer up, Geoff It may not be a room in the Grand, but at least it is facing the sea. - Hey, what's the idea? - What's the matter? - That man insulted me. - Who did ? - He did - What him?

Pleasant dreams I hope you get run over in them To you...Touch you? Doreen, did you dream anything last night? I did. What? I dreamt that I woke up and such a good looking soldier got his arms right behind me. And I've always wondered what it felt like. What was it like? Oh,darling,it was like being in a lovely hot bath with cold water running down your back. That's nothing. Doreen, don't say anything. I've got the funny feeling that it really did happen Do you think so? No, it must have been that Benedictine we had last night. No, Doreen. I'm sure he's lying still next to me. Go on, Mill.Don't be so soft - We'll have a look and see - No you. - No you. - No you. It's your business?Have a look All right.I will. You're quite right,dear. It was a dream! I hope so!

Arthur Give me a hand with the kiddies while I get into my beach pajamas,will you? -Hello, where has he gone? -I've gone to breakfast at McCarter's. "If not there, I'll be at the bank stand" "If not there, I'll be at the pier." "After that, I'll probably be in the Queen's Arms." Just like him. You'll have to give me a hand to pack this all up.
