Pickled in time like gherkins in a jar. Mistress Rani, the Time Tunnel is ready to receive its first guests. Proceed. Fated to wander a dismal corner of the universe for twenty years; helpless, paralysed. It'll drive them insane. 4th DOCTOR: Mayday, mayday. This is an urgent message for all the Doctors. It's vitally important that you listen to me for once. Our whole existence is being threatened by a renegade Time Lord known only as the Rani. She hates me. She even hates children. Two of my earlier selves have already been snared in her vicious trap. The grumpy one and the flautist too. She wants to put us out of action. Lock us away in a dreary backwater of London' East End. Trapped in a time-loop in perpetuity and her evil is all around us. I can hear the heart beat of a killer. She's out there somewhere. We must be on our guard and we must stop her before she destroys all of our other selves. Good luck, my dears. A Cyberman, and a Time Lord from Gallifrey. One more specimen is needed, an Earthling. The menagerie is almost complete. Time is literally of the essence. The Doctor's remaining incarnations are teetering on the edge of a precipice. You're obsessed. Don't forget what we came here for. The Doctor's remaining incarnations are teetering on the edge of a precipice. You're obsessed. Don't forget what we came here for. Earthlings pose no threat to my technology, imbecile. It's the Doctor I want out of the way. Interception in five seconds, Rani. Although I will miss the challenge. Three... two... one... Activate. 7th DOCTOR: Oh, to be in China now that November's here. When was the last time you had that junk heap in for an MOT, professor? 7th DOCTOR: Don't be cynical, Ace. The instruments are just a little erratic, that's all. Great Wall of China? Looks more like the Cutty Sark to me. 7th DOCTOR: Mm... and not a soul in sight. 1973... I didn't set the coordinates on 1973! Oi! Is anybody there? 7th DOCTOR: If I didn't know better, I could be convinced that someone has deliberately taken us off course. Ace, what are you doing? Here, you're not the Doctor. 6th DOCTOR: Yes I am, Ace. We seem to have slipped a groove in time. Where have all these people come from? And where are we? Hey, professor, look at this! What do you mean, discount? This year's been bad enough as it is without you giving things away. Don't worry about it, all right? I tell you, they're going to be all the rage in 1994. What's happening? 3rd DOCTOR: Change. You, me, everything. It's as though someone is rooting through my personal time stream. But what on Earth for? 3rd DOCTOR: Earth. Yes. Excuse me, my good woman, but what year is this? Oi, you come back! 'Ere, he's just nicked an orange! Shouldn't your Martin be looking after the stall? 'E's never 'ere when you want him. I wish my Arthur was still alive. What do you think you're doing? Stop messing the goods about. Do you want to buy something or not? 3rd DOCTOR: Well considering the quality of everything you have, madam, I would say that your prices are rather expensive. I see flares are back in fashion. Yeah, everything from the last century seems to be having a comeback. 3rd DOCTOR: Last century? What year is this? Oh, don't you start. There's enough oddballs around here as it is. 3rd DOCTOR: Madam, what year is this? 2013. Yeah, I can remember exactly where I was when Kennedy was assassinated. But don't tell Arthur! How long ago was that, then? Well, it'll be about ten years. NO! Ian, will you behave! Who are you? 6th DOCTOR: Precisely. I am the Doctor. No you're not! You're nothing like my grandfather. 6th DOCTOR: I feel as though I'm being pulled backwards through time and my companions are being drawn back with me. Ian! Barbara! Where are the others? 6th DOCTOR: The inrush of time zones is designed to seal us all together. Well, my skin's been great since I started using all over sun block. I think it's right it's the law. Law? Since when? Where've you been hiding then? Hi, I thought you'd be involved somewhere along the line. 3rd DOCTOR: What we're seeing here, Sarah, is the work of a genius. An expert in time distortion. A time traveller, maybe, and an ingenious operator. Well then, we must get back to the TARDIS, Doctor. 3rd DOCTOR: It's the other side of the river. You know, we seem to be flitting around in some sort of 20 year time loop; 1973... ... 1993, 2013. 3rd DOCTOR: Yes, well, time distortion of this nature requires an exact localised focus. Well, why this street market in London? 3rd DOCTOR: This isn't the focus, Sarah. Blundering fools, they're getting too near the truth. Release the specimens. Feeding time at the zoo? 5th DOCTOR: And the companions went in two by two. This isn't Noah's Ark, Doctor. 5th DOCTOR: Maybe it is. When I say 'run', run. RUN! Look, you've got to clear the streets. You're in terrible danger! What's your game? You've got to get away from here! 'Ere, who says? If you start shoving me around, you'll know about it. 5th DOCTOR: It's no good, they're in different time zones. To them we're strangers. Have you any idea where we're going? Doctor, where's the TARDIS? 5th DOCTOR: Twenty years back and 3 miles away. Come on! You can't escape, Doctor. Say "goodbye", Doctors. You're all going on a long journey. A very long journey. 5th DOCTOR: The Rani. I take back what I said about an ingenious operator being behind these time jumps. What's going on, Doctor? Who else could master such a difficult operation. Back to my TARDIS! What are you doing? Why bother trying to summon up you remaining selves? I've weakened you. 3rd DOCTOR: I've got a few tricks up my sleeve yet, madam. It's time for you to start losing. You, Earth female, come here. 3rd DOCTOR: No Liz, you mustn't. Leave this to me. I'll take my chances. What are you doing? Leave her alone. Doctor, come on. Quickly! 3rd DOCTOR: Mike, thank you very much. Get me to the TARDIS as quick as possible. 3rd DOCTOR: Brigadier! Come on Doctor, not far now. I'm finding it difficult to keep up with all of you these days, Doctor. 6th DOCTOR: Some other time eh, Brigadier? Alas there's no time for pleasantries. I must find my young friend. We'll speak soon, old chap. To all of you, I hope. I now have everything I want apart from one Earthling. My menagerie is almost complete. Prepare to rematerialise at the centre of the Earth time meridian, Greenwich. I though you said you'd locked it? I did. Someone must have broken in. What's going on here? Oi, you! What's your game? Well you won't find him here. He lives at number one Albert Square, over there. I suggest you leave. Have you seen the Doctor? Yeah, Doctor Legg is the only doctor round here, love. Doctor who? Well, I've seen them thrown out of the VIC., but never dragged in. 3rd DOCTOR: I should be taking it easy, not bounding around like some megaluthian slime skimmer. Who was that terrible woman? 3rd DOCTOR: It's the Rani. Her handiwork is behind all this confusion in time and now her control is beginning to break down. Ah good, there's the TARDIS. Come on Victoria... 7th DOCTOR: The Rani's TARDIS. Doctor! 7th DOCTOR: I see she let you go. Not before she cloned me. She's got a menagerie of clones in there. 7th DOCTOR: She's attempting to transfer a massive time tunnel through the Greenwich Meridian. She has a computer in there with genetic codes and brain prints of every living creature in the entire cosmos. 7th DOCTOR: With it evolution is hers to control. 7th DOCTOR: Except... what form were you in when she cloned you? Now think, it's very important. Romana. 7th DOCTOR: The Time Lady. That means there are two time brains in the Rani's computer. It'll overload. Thirty seconds to computer achieving full power status, mistress. Excellent. 7th DOCTOR: Hold this. Twenty-five seconds, master. 7th DOCTOR: I'm trying to overload the Rani's computer, enhance the power of the time tunnel to pull her TARDIS in and not me. I assume it's not as easy as it sounds? 7th DOCTOR: Of course not. Twenty seconds... 7th DOCTOR: I must try and free my other incarnations. Join me... 3th DOCTOR: We must now. 5th DOCTOR: We must succeed. 6th DOCTOR: Precisely. 4th DOCTOR: Good luck. 5 seconds... 7th DOCTOR: K9, activate the converter. 3... 2... 7th DOCTOR: ...1... Here goes... What did you do to her? 7th DOCTOR: Well, there were two time brains in her computer and I used it to propel her into the trap set for me. So now your other selves are all free? 7th DOCTOR: Certainly I, I mean we, are difficult to get rid of.
