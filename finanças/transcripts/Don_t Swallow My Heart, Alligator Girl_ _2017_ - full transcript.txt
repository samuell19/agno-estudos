ON THE BRAZIL-PARAGUAY BORDER, MOTORBIKE GANGS RACE ON THE HIGHWAYS, CROSSING MEMORIES OF THE WAR BETWEEN THESE COUNTRIES, WHEN BRAZIL KILLED 600,000 PARAGUAYANS AND CONQUERED PART OF ITS TERRITORY. NOW THE SOLDIERS ARE GONE, BUT CONFLICTS BETWEEN BRAZILIAN FARMERS AND SMALL GUARANI RESISTANCE GROUPS STILL COVER THE APA RIVER'S BANKS IN BLOOD. IN THIS LAND HAUNTED BY THE PAST, A BRAZILIAN BOY AND A PARAGUAYAN GIRL WILL LIVE AN IMPOSSIBLE LOVE AND REMEMBER THE GUARANI NAME OF THE BLOODIEST OF BATTLES: ÑANDIPÁ! "TOGETHER WE REACH THE END" Basano! Basano! Basano! Basano! Come back! Stupid Brazilian boy! You can't swim in my river without my permission. I'm Basano, the Tattooed, Queen of Apa River. You know what? You can shove your stupid wooden sword. Everything here is mine! My necklace... Joca? Joca! Get out of the water. What happened, man? Are you crazy? -Where is the girl? -You're hurt! Get out of there. What was that? Your heart sleeps in the bottom of the Apa River. Amidst the sounds of war, motorcycles and alligators. Where my people were killed and my culture was buried between memories and fear. And I walked carrying history with me mixed to my body and my blood of a Guarani warrior. And you? You continued to call my name in the fog, talking about a love that would make me forget everything. You are such a bad boy You go out with all the girls -You don't know how to love -No, I don't... Good evening, Mr. Wayne. Good evening, Clark Kent. I thought you would be hungry, sir. I was. Has she left? Yeah. I don't like sleeping with women. I'd rather wake up alone. I can only stand my brother's snoring. Yeah, right. You're the one who snores. -Me? -You really do. I think it's mom. She sleeps all day. It's been ten years since she left dad and we came to this shithole. You don't remember, but I do. I like it here. You like it because of your Indian girl. That jaguar that scratches you. What was her name? It's a funny name... What was the jaguar's name? I thought you liked it here. Because of your gang. Mom doesn't know what to say and says bullshit. We love parties, having fun, speed and motorbikes. "Gang" sounds like I'm a criminal. Is that what you think? Do you think I'm a criminal? What a stupid Bruce Wayne I've got! Look here. Pay attention. Pay attention. Look at me. Before this bug stops breathing, your wild little jaguar of an Indian girl will have forgotten you. She might even fall in love with you, but she'll leave you. Don't die. -All cool? -Cool. Hey, animal! You're late, man! -How are you, bro? -Cool. Hey. Sorry about the time, Telecath. I had an issue with my mom. Shut up, get me a beer and come back here. Hey, prince! Won't you say hi to your pals? Hey, man! I'll leave you guys alone. My mother is not well, chief. She's on strong medication and I look after my brother. Sorry. So you spent the whole night watching TV with sick mom and baby brother? Is that why you're so late? What's that, Indian? I knew it. What? You have woman smell on you. Maybe it's my mom. Did you know Lucia has a magic nose? What did you tell him? Alberto called me, asking, "Where is my Laurita?" So you've decided to fuck the enemy's girlfriend right one day before the race? Do you know what you deserve? You deserve a round of applause! This is what you deserve! -Congrats! -Way to go! You almost gave me a heart attack. Go to hell, bro! Since when do you have a heart, my prince? Let's go! Leave the guy alone! Let's win the race and beat those losers! -Let's go! -Now you must win the race! Let's go, Calendar Gang! Let's get the Paraguayans! C'mon! Guarani Republic! -Fuck you! -Guarani Republic! Motherfucking Paraguayan! Shitty Paraguayan! Bad dreams, João Carlos? About your shitty father again? No. Then the girl... The tattooed one? Is she still haunting you? Is that Indian girl still there, inside your head? When I go to sleep, I see her. When I open my eyes, I see her. When I draw in my notebook, I draw her. When I get in the shower, I see images of her. Come here. Come, give me a kiss. I've told you you should not come here. I don't want anything with anyone, Alberto. We don't have anything now, but we will, soon. I will break up with Laurita and we'll be together. I got it in a bet with my friends. And you? Did you have luck in the bike race? I lost. Brazilians are cheaters. Your boyfriend's brother was there. He is a good pilot. The "prince". I don't have a boyfriend, Alberto! I don't have anybody. Basano! I was only joking. Hey, girl... Open the door! I am your older cousin. I saw dead bodies in the river. Paraguayans like us. Guaranis like us. Why? Calm down, girl. This is a land of heartless men, you can't help it. Are you ok, Mr. Clark? I am perfecto, señor Wayne. Just perfect! Champion! Champion! I won. And that blood on your hand? You don't remember when we used to hunt jaguars in dad's farm. But I do. Now get out, João Carlos. I want to take a shower. Move it, João Carlos! Go to school, João Carlos. It's time for you to go to school and study. Become a real person. Go, João Carlos. Close the door. Come on in, Joca. You're late. Come on! It was one of the most violent wars in South American history. It's informally called "the Crying War" or "War of Tears", as many of the defeated soldiers returned covered not only in blood, but also in tears. It was one of the cruelest wars in the world and the most violent in Latin American history. Many stories claim the soldiers were not very patriotic, because the government promised them plenty of money and lands. Among the stories of soldiers and former slaves who enlisted to be given a different life, there is the story of a man who survived by hiding under the corpses of allies. He covered his body in blood. Then, at night, he stole a Paraguayan horse and returned to Brazil a rich man... João Carlos! Don't be mad at him, teacher. He's lost his heart. Joca? Am I dead? Are you sure you'll go in the river? I need to find my lucky necklace. My father gave it to me. -Aren't there any alligators? -Of course not! You never know... -Joca? -Joca? Joca, get out of there. -Joca! -Joca! -Joca! -Joca! -I think I've found something. -What? Get out of there. It's dangerous. Joca? Holy shit! Bring it closer. Joca... What's that? Over there! We need to talk, boy. About Laurita? I was just having fun. What's the matter? Come here. Move. All the girls get out of here! Go! Out! Lucia stays. Turn that off! Shit. -February? -Here! -March? -Here. -April? -Ready! -May? -Ready! -July? -Here. -August? -I'm here. -September? -Here. -October? -I'm here. -November? -Here. And you, December? Here. I didn't choose you to be by my side because of your beautiful smiles. I chose you because you are real men. And real men understand that what we do is poetry. Gasoline and music. It's our love for the wind. It's our prayer. Amen. In the name of the Lord. -June? -Here, Telecath. Come here. What the hell is that, June? It stinks! -Look at that! -I will ask only once. Who is the hijo de puta who is killing the fucking Paraguayans and throwing their bodies in my Apa River? He is eating blood. I can taste Brazilian blood mixed with the blood of this poor bastard! If you don't do as I say, do you know what we'll become? A bunch of animals! We are gods! Above me, only the angels! Handsome boy. Laurita's perfume is strange. It smells of earth and blood, doesn't it? You don't need to lie to me. God can hear you. I won't tell anybody. Ok? Telecath doesn't need to know. Don't worry. "Handsome boy." Go. Wait for me there. Mr. Wayne, you've been drinking. -Yes. -I can see that. I'm the man of the house now. The "man of the house"? Great. It's bedtime for the man of the house. You're not my father. -My father's a cheating bastard. -Watch it. -And you're a ghost... -Stop it, kid. Go to bed, kid. I'll protect everyone. I'll conquer my queen, so nobody will die. Got it? Got it? Got it. Now let's go to bed. Let's go, Batman. Come, let's go to bed. Let go. -Hold. Give me this sword. -Let go of me. -Want mom to wake up? -You're not my dad. Come, lay down. What's the matter, king? Sir Lancelot. So you beat your brother now? Ten peasants have disappeared in our region in the last 6 months. There's talk of a suicide wave, but only God knows for sure what is happening on our border. Our dear Apa River has witnessed so much during the war, and now holds the bodies of a civil battle. Go away, Brazilian boy. She will not talk to you! -Go away! -Go! What are you doing here? I found something important. It will stop the war. It's beautiful. Now it's mine. Joca, come here. Basano! My love... Come back. What's this about love? I am not your love. I'm nobody's love. You smell like flowers and shampoo. You are a very rich boy, but your head is empty, you know? You guys, come with us. You, come with me. Here, you dogs, I will tell you once again: Everything you are disgusts me. The new shoes, the white teeth, and your stupid idea of defeating me. I am Basano, the Tattooed. Give up your heart, give up your dignity and give up your victory. Let go of us. Don't do this. Leave it there. Now you are alone on my side of the river. Next time, I will kill you with my own hands in the Apa River's waters. Got it? Come with me. I'm sorry. Quiet, everybody! Shut up, everyone. Finally we have another shot against the Calendar Gang. Bunch of cowards. Good evening, Alberto. How is it on the other side? Do your boys know you're Paraguayan? That your mother was a wild Guarani girl just like mine? Remember Fernando? He's my best partner. December, right? Always last. How is your father doing? Cesar... "The emperor". Stop! Enough! Get out of here! Enough. Quiet. I need five racers! The rest can wait with Lucia. You'll use my bike tonight. Why? Your bike is the best one. I can feel something odd in the air. I don't know what it is. But it's something new. Don't worry, my prince. God is the machine. Let's go Calendar! Let's show them! Guarani Republic! -Come back, Paraguayan bastard! -Guarani Republic! Guarani Republic! Tele... You'll be all right. Shut up. Shut up, my prince. Why? Why me? Because when you walk by, I can see rays of yellow light. Like in the stories my father used to tell me. See how stupid you are? I am a 14-year-old girl. I know more about life than you'll know at 80. Your brother is the enemy. You, too. Me? Basano? Come back! I don't know how to go back. Tell me where you live. Basano! Do you want me to forget my people and language, and go live with you on the other side? Do you want me to forget who I am? No. I love the alligator girl. I love the jaguar girl. I love... Everyone is crazy looking for you. Let's go. Hop on. I don't wanna go with you. Things changed last night. You'll have to learn to listen. You're no longer a child. Let's go. Let's go! Come up! What is it, Fernando? What's the matter? The matter is the end of the world, Mr. Wayne. The end of all we know began in the goddamn Apa River. ...Mr. Wayne. Rumors about former Paraguayan guerrillas hiding in our city were not confirmed... Fernando. Whose motorcycle is that? What happened to yours? Fernando, listen to me. -I don't want any problems. -It's what's left of my best friend. My only friend in this shithole city. This! What were you thinking? That you would come and go like a jaguar, leaving traces everywhere, and I would never ask? What about the news? Do you think I don't worry? -Talk. You can't pretend I'm not here. -Yes, I can. No, you can't. Break whatever if you want! You hear me? You can burn this house down. -I can. It's my house. -So do it! -Because my life is just beginning. -I know. And the people will regret what they said about me and Telecath. Fernando... -Let go. -Listen to me. Stay here. Light a candle for your friend. -Acting like a mother now? -I am one. Yeah? What kind of mother won't even feed a kid? Look at that kid! I'm the one who looks after him. -Respect me! -There's no food, because you left your husband ten years ago -and won't get up! -A man with no respect... -High on meds! -...is not worthy! -Don't touch me. -Show some respect! -Don't you touch me! -I can touch you whenever I want! I am your mother! Where have I lost you boys? How did your father's eyes come to my son's face? Border police is still investigating the death of the mechanic Sebastian Gamarra, known as Telecath, in a mysterious accident last night on the road leading to Caracol. A soy truck abandoned on the road seems to have caused the accident. All the paths All the roads to travel But you're not here A new life to live A new story to tell Your absence is the love you left in me December... I was thinking back there... How weird that your bike malfunctioned just when Telecath rode it, don't you think? The gang is saying that your bike was acting funny that day. So? Say something, asshole! You don't know what you're saying. Don't call me asshole. So you don't know? When an Indian is killed, the newspapers call it an accident. Or suicide. Or say a ghost killed them. White people should learn what memory is. -What the hell? -What's with you, Indian? Did you eat shit, Indian? Do you have the guts to say the names of the Paraguayans you killed? Do you have the guts to say why Sebastian is dead? Do you? Talk, December! -Hey, calm down, man. -Easy! Take it easy, man! Can you smell my jacket? This blood smell? -It's Telecath's blood. -Let her go, December. While you were making up stories, I went there and brought his body back. While they wept and were grossed out. -Come on, December! -Step back! Step back! -Step back! -Stop! -Shitty little Indian... -Easy! -You're a bunch of cowards! -Calm down, man! You hear me? You lying bastard. Phony Brad Pitt. Son of a bitch! -Are you crazy? -Are you turning him against us? -Are you afraid of him? -No one is afraid. Are you all afraid of him? No more Indian bullshit. Cowards. Bunch of sissies. What's up? I see you passing by sometimes. Where have you been? Alone in the river. Swimming and thinking of the things I've seen. You're cute when you lie, Basano. You've heard the news? Haven't you? They will come for us. There is no way back. Are you with me? Tell me, Basano. Are we on the same side? If not, you shouldn't stay. Go. Go away! Don't come back. For the last time. Are you with me? Basano! Basano! Yes. Hey, kid. -How are you? -Fine, you? Here. Shoot there. Not the cow. Do you remember all of this? -Used to be bigger, right? -Yes. I mean, the bushes. It was all bush. You used to come here a lot. Your mother brought you here. We need to talk, dad. Yeah. It's weird to hear you calling me dad. I'm here in this farm, all alone. It's lonely and quiet all year round. And then this big ape arrives and calls me "dad". I have to leave. I can't stay in this state anymore. Can't go to the city either. I can't keep covering up your mess. I have to leave. For a second, I thought I'd seen a spark of anger in your eyes. But I was wrong. You're still the same, mama's little child. Pussy. One day, all of this will be yours. Yours and João Carlos'. How is he doing? Is the little one fine? He thinks he's in love. I finally gave the last of your mother's stuff to the employees. Piling up old trash is for dirty river curves, right? You, your mom and your brother are nothing but old trash in my life. Hey, kid... Do you know what's eating you? What's making you look like a toad with a sealed mouth? You know? It's because you didn't finish what you had to do. Do it for us. Then you can go wherever you want. Telecath... His name was Sebastian, but we used to call him Telecath. I'm angry at what they did to him. But in fact I feel guilty. Guilty? I didn't protect this paradise for you to give it away to a handful of Indians, blacks or Paraguayans because of guilt. Smell your hands. Smell your hands and tell me what you want to do! They smell of blood. But not human blood. It's animal blood. Right, dad? Animal blood. And animals must be killed. You will guide my boy, Mago. He will need you. Be careful. And while your coward brother was hiding, his motorcycle gang started to vanish from the city. I will not die today. I will not die today. I will not die. Amidst stories of accidents, assaults and suicides. The ghosts of war came back amidst smoke and empty lands, looking again for the anger hiding in our eyes. Meanwhile, you dreamed about a gesture of love that would change our world forever. Guarani Republic! Guarani Republic! I will not die. -I am happy. -We are happy! Mysterious fires still haunt the farmers between the cities of Maracaju and Bela Vista. Some Brazilian farmers claim that a group of Guaranis from Paraguay is behind this. Brazilian authorities are concerned, because violence in the region seemed to be under control... Eat. To get strong. And go after her. Isn't that the plan? What if I can't forget her? What if she never likes me? Then there's only one solution: killing yourself to kill the love. Or we can kill the Indian girl. Wait here, Basano. What is it? Do you need something? -No. -So? -I want to talk to her. -Not with her. Go away. Go! Leave! Go! Go! Go! Get out of here! Go! Can you go? No. You must go. Please, go. -No. -Leave! Please, go! Just a second. He may have something to tell us. Want to tell us something? Say it! Say it! Leave him. Let's go. Come back! Let's have a beer! Hey buddy, hang out with us. Wait a second. Long time. I thought you have forgotten me. It's been 300 hours. You still smell of bad shampoo. Sorry. It's ok, I like it. But now I'm 15. I'm a woman now. I can't play with you anymore. Here. I know you came for it. It's yours. Take it. No. I was looking for you. We need to talk. You want that kiss, right? Tell me where your brother Fernando "December" is hiding, and I'll give you your heart back. My dear Brazilian. Basano, come here. What's up? If I could tell you where he is, would you promise never to touch me again? If I tell you where the last Brazilian is hiding, do you promise never to look for me again? My warrior... My little queen of the Apa River. I've got news, chief. The "prince" is still in the region. He will come and we will be ready. Son! What are you doing? Joca! Stop! What's the matter? Why are you doing this? Joca! Stop, son! Joca! Stop! Stop it, son! Stop it! What is it? What's the matter? What's the matter? She tricked me. Look at me. What happened to you, son? What did you do? Look at me, son. Don't worry, mom. I'll save him. Mr. Clark? They've found you, right? Fernando? She tricked me. My Indian girl betrayed me. We can try to escape. But this dust sticks to us. To our boots and our lungs. Red dust... It even comes out of our nose when we breathe. And in these flat lands, there's nowhere to hide. Go in there and find happiness. It's either them or you. Go in there and be happy. Very happy. What have I become? This is your big day, kid. I'll come back. Fernando! Hey, handsome. Did you miss me? I thought you'd never come. We were waiting for you. I should have killed you before. But Telecath really liked you. I can say the same. Do it, Indian. Finish it. Why hurry, my prince? "We are gods..." "Above us, only the angels." "Gods..." Alberto... The boys are back. At the bridge. Does Joca know that his brother is dead? "Onward until defeat. Always." Go away, Brazilian boys! She doesn't like you anymore! Go away! What are you doing here? Are you crazy? Do you want to die? Today, here, again, we came to be defeated by you. Basano, the Tatooed, queen of the Apa River, queen of my heart and my soul. We are here for the last time, for our last defeat. To get that second kiss I deserve. To save the honor of my family, my people, and my brother. Attack! -Joca, don't... -Come on! -There are many of them. -Attack! For the last time! Let's go! Time would pass and you would leave. And you would be 30 years old... 40 years old... 50 years old... 100 years old. But all the progress, money, or trips to the stars would not matter. And all the gold, silver, and immense cities would not matter. You would continue following me in the shadows. Tied to the legs of this female Guarani warrior. Held forever in the waters of my Apa River. Like a soldier who would never go back home. Like a soldier eaten by the teeth of his own memories. You would dream about me and wake up alone in the big city night. And once again, you'd call my name and remember my face. Did I lose? Did I lose again? My silly Brazilian... Your heart was always yours. But now, it's mine. This is called an ambush. You've lost your brother, but now I am free. João Carlos... My enemy. My love. Basano... Did you say my name? You called me João Carlos. Everything will be ok. I will talk to Fernando. I'll tell him that we're together, ok? Basano?
