Subtitles by explosiveskull Do you think it's gonna sell out? What? Fright Fest. Well, which movie looked best to you? Uhm, I don't know. Well, there Kamarimanku. There's Camp Blood. Full Moon Silver Bullet. Or Bride of the Living Dead. The horror movie. Two, please. Fright Fest! Alright, so you have to have an opinion on this. Fast zombies or slow zombies? I don't know, fast? No, fast zombies are a total abomination. You lose all nuance. If you think about it, zombies are the total metaphor for... So we're locked in here all night? Yeah, if you can handle it. Greetings my bloody talon. Welcome to Fright Fest. I have hand picked four tremulous tales to invade your cinemaplex tonight. These four distinct tastes of terror will run throughout the night. If the first taste isn't enough, go back for seconds, thirds, fourths. This is a buffet of blood. Gorge yourself on gore! But, it's not for the faint of heart. At any point you find the horrors too much, you'll find a chicken exit located just left of the screen. Darach? Darach? Christ, Sarah, what? I heard something downstairs. Chicken exit, really? I have never taken the chicken exit. Wow, you must be so proud. Go back to sleep, it's the rock. No, Darach. Darach! Please, go back to sleep. I have a massive headache. Turn off the bloody light. Darach? Sarah? I'm inspector O'Connor. Yes? I was hoping to ask Sarah some questions. She already explained everything to the other police officers. Yes. Sarah, I was told that you heard someone in the room with your husband before you found him. A scream? It was a woman, wailing. Like a, something like nails on a chalkboard or something. This noise, it came from the bedroom? Yeah. Did you see this woman? She wasn't in there. Did you see anyone entering or leaving the house? No. You think I'm crazy. I believe you heard something, but events like this can cloud your mind. These bottles, they from last night? Yeah, that's enough, leave us, please. She needs to rest. Look, I'll call you if we find out anything unusual about your husband's death, and we'll get that comb you found analyzed. If you think of anything, call me. Hey, I made you some tea, and cleaned a little. Did you get rest last night? A bit. Good. Sarah, why don't you come and stay with us for a while? I think being amongst people in the city will do you good. Thanks, but I think I need some time alone. Okay. You know, last night I kept thinking about something that happened a few days ago. Darach came back from the walking the fields a few days ago, and he was... Drunk out of his mind, but terrified. He said he saw a woman there screaming, then she disappeared. And that it was some ghost that haunts his family or something... Banshee. You know it? It's a story my mom told me as a child. Well, what is it? It's a kid's story. Tell me. Well... There's this legend about a woman called a banshee, who would haunt some of the Irish families. And she would wait forever in the field for her husband to return from the sea. Well, according to the legend, people who would hear her wail, would have a family member die that night. And people who saw her would die themselves. Darach would have seen this banshee. No, Sarah, it's a ghost story. There's no such thing as a banshee. Well, then what do you think what I heard? You said you heard a rumble. And a scream! It could have been Darach. He had a heart attack. He was only 29. And an alcoholic. Out. Look, Sarah... Please leave. This is where you saw her? Right there. Did you get a good look at her? She was quite far away, but she had a white dress covered in blood and long hair. She just disappeared? I know how it sounds, but you should know what I saw. Sarah, I wanna believe you, but... You know about the banshee? Yes. When I got the call about your husband, about the scream you heard, I've heard about that before. Long time ago. When I was a boy, my father claimed our family was one of the Irish families cursed by a pagan witch, the banshee. My father said he heard the wail the night before my uncle passed away. I thought he was mad. And uh... Do you believe me? I don't know what I believe. We'll do some research into the banshee. It's all I can promise for now. Thanks. And did you find anything on the comb? Nothing. Sarah, are you alright? Yeah, just some sleep. Sarah? It's Inspector O'Connor. I think the banshee's in the house. What? I'm on my way, listen. I did some research on the banshee, you need to hear this. Apparently, the legend is based on a woman who lived in the 1600s, who was nicknamed the Banshee. She sacrificed her husband in some ritual and claimed he went off to sea. What happened to her? The villagers found her blood stained dress. She was burned at the stake as a witch. The villagers believed she imprinted her evil in her silver comb. Sarah, there's more. It's not what you think. Sarah? Sarah? Sarah, what's going on? Sarah? Sarah? She's gone. Sarah, are you alright? She's gone. I defeated her, I burned her comb. Sarah, what comb? Comb. I wanted to tell you on the phone. The story about the witch, the banshee... They're not real. I saw her in the house. - Sarah... - She... It's a delusion. She's not real? These stories about fairies and witches, they're just inspiration for your mind. People have been telling stories about the banshee since the 1600s. But it's all in your mind. I don't understand. Sarah, you're not well. The banshee is a warning from your body. Come on, let me make you a cup of tea. No, I think that I need some rest. This sucks, I'm leaving! Really? Right at the good part, too. Shit! Come on, Frankie, get it together, Jesus. Hey, you alright? Yup, I'm fine. What happened, you get spooked? I mean, you could have left. Remember the whole chicken exit? You're my ride. I'm fine, what's next? Full Moon just started in theater five? Perfect! Alright. You guys are always at the same night. What, alright! Two for two, okay, here you go, thank you. One, please. Hi Sir, one, alright, there you go. Alright all the way to the left. Hey sir, how can I help you? There you go. Use the door right down there. - Hi, what can I do for you... - One, please. One, gotcha, there you go, enjoy your show. One, please. Sorry kid, it's a private screening, invitation only. I have a note from my dad. Cute kid, but I can't let you in. Come back tomorrow for the screening of frozen. The horror movie on the ski slope? No. Enjoy the show! For you, Sir? I'd like a rack of ribs and some chicken. Okay, we just ran out of ribs, but I can bring that chicken out to you in about a minute. And for you, Sir? Skittles. There's a back door over here. Come on, Brandy, you really wanna see a crappy movie? You're both chickenshits. I'm missing Vampire Diaries. Here it is! Shouldn't you be minding the concession stand? We just ran out of meat! Did you check the freezer? Of course, I did! We're out, I'm telling you, it's gone! 10 minutes to sundown. I know, and I'm starving! I told you to eat before you got here! I've got a litter to feed! Ah! What? Ah, just that looks amazing! See ya, losers! And let's lock her up. Hey, let us in! Later losers! You suck and I hope you get caught! Dad will get her out of trouble, he always does. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome! Welcome to oh, hey, hey, hey! We're thrilled to have you with us! Before us the famous cult classic film, Foaming at the Mouth Part Two.

What's the matter, little girl? It's not gonna be that bad? They'll kill you real fast, we promise. Why didn't you just let me in? I had a note from my dad. Oh, that's right, a note from your dad. How could I forget? Please allow my daughter, Brianne, to see the movie Foaming at the Mouth Two. If you don't let her, you'll regret it. Hey pal, what'd we miss? Just the standards, full moons, owls and a guy with a monstrous secret. Awesome. Hey buddy, you okay? I think we should go. Run! - Shit! - Seriously? It's literally locked. Oh, my God! We gotta hide! Stop that! Stop what? What you're doing. Oh, you mean, this? What time is it? 4:30. I have to leave pretty soon. Sun comes up at 6:30. My wife's plane doesn't get here til 5:30. I'm not worried about your wife. What does she do again? She works for the Ciph Room. Sounds boring. Yeah, it is, she's always taking trips, leaving me here to take care of the kids. You don't have kids. It's what I call the dogs. Divorce her. I can't. Can't? Not yet anyway. It's too much money involved. You don't need money anymore, my dear. No fucking way! Quick, get in the closet! Oh, come on! Do it! Everything alright? Yeah, you're home early. Yeah, I took an earlier flight, thought I'd surprise you. Well, you did. Good. What time did you go to bed? Oh, about 12:30. Really? It's pretty early. Who's in the closet? What? Do you think I'm stupid, Ronald? Calm down sweetie, okay? I will. Just let me check one more thing first. Jesus Christ! Hah, how about that? You're crazy. Well, I have two bullets left. I can use one on you and one on myself. No, I'll just use both on you. No wait! God, you're heavy. I gotta hand it to you, Ronald. You had me fooled for at least a month. How long did you think it would take me? Out every night, nowhere to be seen during the day. I called your work last week. They said you just stopped showing up. Schmuck. I guess this means you won't have to divorce me. No pre-nup, either. Well, now that you're dead, I can be honest. I never took that trip to Atlanta. I just waited for you and that whore in the back to make it to our bed. Well, my bed actually. I'm the one who paid for it. Where'd you find the bimbo, anyway? I followed her around, but couldn't find where she lived. Probably homeless. Way to aim high, Ron. I spent the last 10 years defending you. Do you even know what I went through? My father kept telling me, don't marry that man, he'll only hurt you. But did I listen? No. I just kept telling everyone, you don't know the real Ron. Oh, it's just so disgusting. I hate you, Ronald. I hate everything about you. I'm glad that you're dead. Time to dump the garbage. Remember this spot, Ron? We used to stay up all night and watch the sun come up. Hmm. Wow, S&M, charming. What the hell? Huh, that's what I thought. Oh, shit. Ronald! Ronald, where are you, honey? What the fuck is this? Elaine! I'm sorry about what I said. I don't hate you! I'm just uh, disappointed. Yeah, that's it, I'm just... Disappointed and hurt? Elaine. Sweety. Alright, alright, you wanna divorce? I'll give you a divorce. Ron, dear? Shit. Hah, spare! I'll miss watching the sun come up. You'll get used to it. Did you finish, Elaine? Actually, I had a better idea. She'll turn just before sunrise. Figured she'd like to see it again. Just for old time's sake. Payback for putting four bullet holes in me. Goodbye, dear. You know, it never really was about the money. It was about spending the rest of my life with someone as lifeless as you. Hurry up, we have less than 30 minutes! You were great back there. Thanks, sweety. So were you. Ma'am, you okay? Cutting it pretty close. Drive faster. This is as fast as this piece of shit goes, sweety. What the hell are you doing? I don't know. It must have got a flat or something. Shit, keep driving. If I keep driving, it's gonna make things worse. There's a spare in the back. What's taking so long? I thought I saw something. Open the door! - Shit! - What? It's in Elaine's purse at the bottom of the river! What about the house keys? Well, she had them. Shit! Don't you know the combination? It's not working! It's been changed! Elaine, open the door! Who's lifeless now, schmuck? So we just stay in here all night? I don't know, I just, I need some time to think. Okay. So do you do this for all of your first dates, or am I special? What take them to horror movies? No, save them from werewolves and J-horror cliches. What? You like me. Do not. It's okay, I'm pretty cool. Yeah, you're okay, when you're not being a diva. Excuse me? You know what, all my attention's on you now. So don't screw this up, lover boy, pressure's on. Did you hear that? Yeah, hang on. Jesus Christ, it's Michael Martin. Michael Martin was in Slumber Party Slaying. The killer in Camp Blood is Norman Ferris. I think I love you. I know. Finch, Finch! Norman Ferris, no defense. Finch! Is that supposed to work? Man, I don't know, he drowned in the movie! God, you're such a geek! No, I'm not! So Jack, you said your parents left just before I got here? They do that a lot, huh? Just leave you here alone in this big old house by yourself? I'm not alone. You're just like all the other sitters. No one ever believes me. Hey, hey, take it easy. I believe you, it's just a little unusual, is all. It's cool. It's just I don't normally take jobs by text message. I like to talk to the parents first. That way I know what rules to break. I don't know about you, but I like to eat and watch TV at the same time. But, but we're not supposed to. Mom always says that when... Well, she isn't here, is she? So it'll be our little secret. Plus there's a pirates versus ninjas movie on. Yay! You see this, you pirate bitches? Uh, somebody save me! Don't you see it will never end? Pirate killing ninja, ninja killing pirate. It'll never stop. No, no it won't. Not unless I kill every last one of them. He's just a peasant. The poor sheath can hide this steel. I've got your back, pirate. What was that? There's too many of them! You and Julia get out of here! Jack! Hey, Jack! You guys have a cat or dog or something, you forgot to tell me about? Ninjas and pirates, it's a new generation. Then what was that? I don't know. Probably the monsters. The monsters? The monsters in my room. You have monsters in your room? Yeah, I'm sure that's it, monsters. Just one more story, please? Jack, you've had just one more story about seven or eight times already. It's time for bed, little buddy. Aw, my other sitters always read me more stories. Hey speaking of, how many other sitters have you had? You make it sound like no one sticks around very long. Come on, Sarah, just one more story. This one's my favorite. Look, you don't want to go to bed, I get that. Is it the dark you're scared of? I can leave the light on. No, no, don't let the light in, okay, promise? Okay, okay, take it easy. But think of it this way, if the light's on, the monsters are too scared to come out, alright? They always come out, always. Oh. That little monkey. Jack! Jack! Don't make me come up... There. That's weird. Jack, I thought I told you to... It wasn't me, it was the monsters. And what monsters would that be? But they, they were... Jack, there are so such thing as monsters, and there will be no more playing, got it? It's bed time, buddy. Now sweet dreams. No one ever believes me. That is it, mister! You are going to be in so much... They're real! The monsters! I told you. Jack, I gotta get you out of here! Oh, they're not going to get me. They're trying to get away from me. I like them, they're mine. I won't ever let them leave. Jack! It's not them, it's me. I'm the monster. The monster you're so scared of. No! It can't be! It's like Dawn of the Dead here. Kinda yeah, with like tweaking out zombies. No, like real 1978 lumbering Romero zombies. Well, I guess it's time for the chicken exit. Do you think we could push through? We're gonna have to before they come fully to. You're kidding. That's our only way out. Okay. Well, I'm not really sure how I'm gonna top this for a second date. Second date? Well yeah, I mean, I kinda wanna take you out again, if you want to. I had fun! And I guess you could say I saved your ass in there, so I feel like you owe me. I owe you? Okay, one condition, no movies. Do you hear something? Subtitles by explosiveskull
