You're right, Crandall. You caught me. They're your mother's panties. Tell her thanks for the good times! Hey, Tully. Hey, where are my cigarettes? Your cigarettes? You stole my fucking cigarettes. I resent that baseless accusation. Cut the shit. I have no cigarettes now. And Briggs says you suddenly had five of them to trade for a skin mag. I don't indulge in pornography. I get enough of the real thing. Especially with Crandall's mom! Hey, Kountze. Ten dollars for this? Looks more like a nickel bag. Don't buy that, Harriman. He's ripping you off. -Plus, it's ditch weed. -Fuck you, Tully. This shit's premium weed, all right? And unlike you, I'm stuck here. It's got to last me through Christmas. Take pity on him, Harriman.

Luck of the Irish. I thought this was your year. It was. I told Woodrup my mother has lupus. Does she? I don't know. Probably. We don't talk about those things. So, who got stuck with it? Who do you think? That poor walleyed bastard. Rémy Martin. Louis XIII. Christmas gift from the Board of Trustees. Oh, how generous of them. Thank you again for doing this, Hunham. I wouldn't have asked if it weren't an emergency. Oh, Mr. Endicott's mother, right. What a tragedy. It's not as though you had plans to leave campus anyway. And, of course, there's a nice little bonus in it for you. Well... "Non nobis solum nati sumus," I suppose. "Not for ourselves alone are we born." I'm guessing that's Cicero. Cicero, yes. Very good, Hardy. You remembered. There'll be just four boys holding over this year. Mm-hmm. Oh, yes. I know a couple of these reprobates. Let's be a little more elastic in our assessment, shall we? It's hard enough for them to be away from home on the holidays. Latitude is the last thing these boys need. Paul, at your core, you're an excellent teacher, but your approach to the students is rather traditional. This school was founded in 1797. I thought tradition was our stock in trade. -Then let's call it hidebound. -Ah. You know, unwavering, resistant to... Yes, yes, yes, I know what "hidebound" means. Uh, I get it. You're still angry that I failed Jordan Osgood. Senator Osgood was very upset when Princeton rescinded Jordan's acceptance, yes. And I've continued to have to deal with the fallout. Hardy, are we really supposed to let these boys just skate by as long as Daddy builds a new gymnasium? Of course not. That's not who we are. But we can't be ignorant to politics. That boy is too dumb to pour piss out of a boot. A genuine troglodyte. Jesus Christ, Paul. He was a legacy and the son of one of our biggest donors. Ever think his dad might be expecting a little consideration for his dollar? And he got it -- a first-class education for his son. Oh, come on, Hardy. As Dr. Greene used to say, "Our one true purpose is to produce young men of good character." I don't care what Dr. Greene used to say. "And we cannot sacrifice our integrity on the altar of their entitlement." I'm just trying to instill basic academic discipline. That's my job. Isn't it yours? It was. Until I became headmaster and saw that it's not so simple to keep the damn school afloat. I begged you, begged you to give the kid a C minus. No. There are instructors here who will do that. I am not one of them. Here's the manual and a full set of keys. Everything you need to know is in there. Your only task is to ensure the boys' absolute safety and good condition. And at least pretend to be a human being. Please. It's Christmas. Fuck this half-day bullshit. Where the hell is Walleye? He's probably jerking off in the Cobb salad. -Why would he do that? -Because he's Walleye. Who knows what that foul-smelling freak does? But you went straight to the Cobb salad. I mean, do you know something? Because I eat that Cobb salad. Salve, gentlemen. Your final exams. Hmm. I can tell by your faces that many of you are shocked at the outcome. I, on the other hand, am not, because I have had the misfortune of teaching you this semester. And even with my ocular limitations, I witnessed firsthand your glazed, uncomprehending expressions. Sir, I don't understand. That's glaringly apparent. No, it's... I can't fail this class. Oh, don't sell yourself short, Mr. Kountze. I truly believe that you can. I'm supposed to go to Cornell. Unlikely. Please, sir. My dad's going to flip out. All right. All right. Uh, in the spirit of the season, I suppose the most constructive way of dealing with your shortcomings is to offer a makeup exam. You'll all get a second run at this after break. Of course, it will not be the same exam. You will now be responsible for new material as well. Your grade will be an average of the two. Please open your books to chapter six. The Peloponnesian War, gentlemen. You've already met Pericles. Now prepare yourselves to meet Demosthenes. No offense, sir, but is this really the best time to be starting a new chapter? I mean, we all appreciate the, uh, makeup exam gesture, but our families are here. You know, most teachers have already canceled class. We have chapel in 40 minutes, then we're out of here. -Mm. -I mean, our heads are elsewhere. And where exactly is your head, Mr. Tully? Um, I don't know. St. Kitts. Yes, indeed. I see you've brought your valise. Spot-on, sir. It's just that it's been a really exhausting semester. Getting into new material now right before break? Honestly, it's a little absurd. Sir. Well, I would hate to be absurd. So let's just scuttle the whole thing, shall we, and let the original grades stand. Uh, excuse me, sir. I think, uh, we all liked the first option better. What'd you say the guy's name was? Uh, Demosthe-who? Of course, I still expect you to be familiar with chapter six upon your return, so pack those textbooks, boys. And if displeased, take it up with your champion -- Mr. Tully. Dismissed. I got us out early, didn't I? ♪ Born thy people to deliver ♪ ♪ Born a child and yet a king ♪ ♪ Born to reign in us forever ♪ ♪ Now thy gracious kingdom bring. ♪ Please be seated. Welcome, Barton students, faculty and parents. I know you're all anxious to start the holidays. I can see the boys shifting in their seats. But before we release you to your bountiful tables and the blessings of family, let us pray for those less fortunate than we. Let us remember the poor and the helpless, the cold, the hungry and the oppressed. Extra reading over vacation and no makeup test? Are you fucking kidding me? Nice work, anus. Can you not talk, please? I'm trying to pray. You better pray I don't catch you alone, because I will full-on nut-punch you. Tone it down. - Jesus can hear you. - ...and all those who know not the loving kindness of God. Sorry to hear about your mother, Endicott. What? Oh. Yes. Thank you. Yeah. We're all pulling for her. ...and your grace. And finally, let us pray for the soul of Curtis Lamb, Barton class of 1969. Just this year, Curtis gave his life valiantly in the service of his country. And let us once again extend our deepest condolences to one of the most cherished members of the Barton family, his mother Mary. Mary, we remember Curtis as such an outstanding and promising young man, and we know this holiday season will be especially difficult without him. Please know that we accompany you in your grief. May the all-powerful God who protected Abraham when he left his native land protect all our brave soldiers until they are delivered safely home to us. We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen. Amen. I wish you all a very Merry Christmas. Or, as the case may be, a very Happy Hanukkah. Congressman, Merry Christmas to you. Merry Christmas, everyone. Merry Christmas. Hey. Good to see you. Nice to see you. Merry Christmas. Angus Tully. You have a phone call. You're telling me this now? Sweetheart, listen. I know it's last minute, and I am... I'm absolutely heartbroken, but could you please see your way to staying at school over break just this once? Stanley has been working so hard, and-and we've had no time for a honeymoon. You guys have been married since July. You've had all these months. Something's always come up. I know it's a lot to ask, but you know how lonely I've been. I've been lonely too. And what about Boston? You promised on the way we'd spend some time in Boston. Angus, listen to me. This is our new family, okay? I know you miss your father-- I do, too-- but there's someone new in my life. It's just this once, darling. We'll be together at spring break, and we'll have the whole summer. Fuck the summer, and fuck Stanley. Angus. Are you kidding me? I'm just supposed to stay here? Mom, please don't do this. Please. I suspect that, like me, this is not how you wanted to spend your holidays, but such are the vicissitudes of life. And as Barton men, we learn to confront our challenges with heads held high and with a spirit of courage and good fellowship. Uh, in strict accordance with the dictates of the manual, of course. Mr. Tully, are you joining us as well? What happened to St. Kitts? Something came up. So, for the next two weeks, we will be following a standard school schedule... Sir? Uh, sir, we're on vacation. ...which means we will be taking our meals together, and you will observe regular hours of study. Study? Are you kidding me? The Peloponnesian War awaits, Mr. Kountze. You and Mr. Tully. The rest of you can get a jump on the next semester. It'll pay off. You'll see. We're already holding over, and now we're being punished for it? You will be afforded limited windows for recreation and supervised physical activity. The gym's not even open yet. Yeah, they've only lacquered half the floor. Fresh air will do you good. It's like 15 degrees outside. And the Romans bathed naked in the freezing Tiber. Adversity builds character, Mr. Tully. Uh, speaking of which, the school will be cutting heat to dormitories and faculty housing, so we'll all be bunking in the infirmary. Oh, God. Geez. This is the most bullshit ever. If we have to stay, why'd we have to draw Walleye? Uh, you know he used to be a student, right? Yeah, that's why he knows how to inflict maximum pain on us, the sadistic fuck. At least we didn't draw Decker. He'd be perving all over us. Hey, guys, hold up for a second. Want one? No. I got something else. Give me that. Hey, don't smoke that out here. I don't want to get busted by Walleye. Don't be such a pussy. I'm not a pussy. I just don't want to end up at Fork Union paying for your mistake. Teddy Kountze. Jason Smith. Yeah, I know who you are. Want to hit this? Uh, yeah. You got a great arm, man. Yeah, well, it's just football. So, how'd you get stuck holding over? I'm supposed to be skiing with my folks up at Haystack, but my dad put his foot down, said I can't come home unless I cut my hair. So why don't you just cut your hair? Civil disobedience, man. Yeah, right. No, he's cool. It's just a battle of wills. Still, I was kind of hoping he'd cave first, because the powder up at Haystack is so sweet right now. What about you, Mr. Moto? Why are you here? Uh, no. Uh, my name is Ye-Joon. Uh, my family is in Korea, and they think it's too far for me to travel alone. I figured it was because your rickshaw was broken. Uh, what-what's a rickshaw? You're an asshole, Kountze. Your mind's a cesspool and a shallow one at that. Who's the asshole, Tully? You're the one who blew up history. Hey. What's your story, man? Alex Ollerman. I'm here because my parents are on a mission in Paraguay. We're LDS. Mormons, right? Don't you guys wear some kind of like magic underwear? That's a common misconception. Actually, it's called a temple garment, and we're only supposed to wear it when we... Hey, what's up with the townies? Hey, what are you doing with our Christmas tree? The school sold it back to us. Scotch pine, still fresh. Yeah, we're going to put it back on the lot. We do it every year. This is the most bullshit ever. Hello, Mary. Mr. Hunham. I heard you got stuck with babysitting duty this year. How'd you manage that? Oh, I don't know. I suppose I failed someone who richly deserved it. Oh, the Osgood kid? Yeah, he was a real asshole. Rich and dumb. Popular combination around here. It's a plague. Uh, and you? You'll be here, too? All by my lonesome. My little sister Peggy and her husband invited me to go visit them at Roxbury, but I feel like it's too soon. Like Curtis will think that I'm abandoning him. You know, this is the last place that my baby and I were together, -not including the bus station. -Yeah. Well, I look forward to your fine cooking. Oh, no, no. Don't do that. All we've got is whatever is in that walk-in. No new deliveries till January. Hmm. You mind if I, um... -You want some of that? -Mm. - All right. - Thank you. -You know this is a necessity. -Oh, yes. ♪ WABC ♪ ♪ Top 100 of the year. ♪ Now 17.

Give me my goddamn picture. Hey, what's your problem, Tully? You homesick? Huh? Gonna cry? Little boy misses his mommy? Fuck you, Kountze. Why are you even here, anyway? Where's your family? We're renovating our house, all right? It's all torn up. They're storing the tools and stuff in my room. That's what they told you? It's winter, idiot. Nobody renovates their house in the winter. Your parents don't want you around because you're a fucking insecure sociopath. Hey, take it easy, guys. A what? I mean, who'd want you for a son? That's why you grind everybody, because deep down you know you're an asshole. Plus, academically, you're a disaster. I mean, if I were your parents, I'd never want you home again. The only tool in your room is you. Bitch. - Come on! Come on! - Hey, hey, hey! All right, all right. Break it up. Break it up. Break it up. They weren't fighting. I see. And who started it -- the not fighting? Hmm? Mr. Tully, perhaps you could shed some light on the subject. Mr. Kountze? Mr. Smith? Mr. Ollerman? Mr. Park? All right, then, uh, we'll do it like the Roman legions. Absent a confession, one man's sin is every man's suffering. For every minute the truth is withheld, you will all receive a detention. And I thought all the Nazis were hiding in Argentina. Stifle it, Tully. Now, uh, in the first of said detentions, you will clean the library, top to bottom. Scraping the underside of the desks, which are caked with snot and gum and all manner of ancient, unspeakable proteins. Ah, on your hands and knees, down in the dust, breathing in the dead skin of generations of students and desiccated cockroach assholes. It was Kountze! Kountze started it. Bravo, Mr. Ollerman. Bravo. Lovely. Thank you, Mary. Didn't we already have this for lunch? And it was crappy then. Consider yourselves lucky. During the Third Punic campaign, 149 to 146 BC, the Romans laid siege to Carthage for three entire years. By the time it ended, the Carthaginians were reduced to eating sand and drinking their own urine. Hence the term "punitive." Uh... Mary? Maybe you would, uh... maybe you would care to join us? No, I'm all right. Thank you. I mean, I know she's sad about her son and everything, but still, she's getting paid to do a job, and she should do it well, right? But I guess, no matter how bad a cook she is, now they can never fire her. Will you shut up! You have no idea what that woman has been thr... You know, Mr. Kountze, for most people, life is like a henhouse ladder. Shitty and short. You were born lucky. Maybe someday, you entitled little degenerates will appreciate that.

She hates him. Oh. How long were you married? I was engaged to Curtis's father. -Mm. -But he died before I gave birth. Harold. He worked in the shipyard. And one day, they was carrying this big, uh, cargo pallet, and the cable snapped. Hit him right across the head. They were good men. Both of them. And neither of them made it to 25. My baby wasn't even 20. I'm so sorry. I took this job when Curtis was small because I wanted to ensure that he was going to have a good education. -You know he flourished here. -Yes. No, he was a great kid. -I had him one semester. -Mm-hmm. Very insightful. Mm-hmm. He hated you. He said you were a real asshole. Well, uh, like I said... sharp kid. Insightful. He had his heart set on Swarthmore. And he had the grades, but I didn't have the money. Even with financial aid, it wasn't enough. So, when he got called up and no student deferment, off he went. Do you know what he said to me? He said, "Hey, Ma, look at the upside. When I get discharged, I can go to college on the GI Bill." College. And here we are. With my Curtis in the cold ground and those boys safe and warm in their beds. It's like you said. How'd you say it? "Life is like a henhouse ladder." That's right.

We have this prescription. Percodan. Okay. Uh, give me a couple minutes. Thank you. Look, you said, if Woodrup finds out, you're screwed, so now he won't find out. What happens if your parents inquire? Never gonna happen. Trust me. Okay, then. This all remains entre nous. Got it? You know what entre nous means? Oui, monsieur. Now you owe me. Owe you? Oh, do not try to leverage me, Mr. Tully. All I'm looking for is a little thank-you that I did something nice for you. That's all. Think I'll start with a beer. How about you? Don't be ridiculous, Mr. Tully. Get your cheeseburger. -They've got Miller High Life. -Mm. -The champagne of beers. -Oh. Okay, you ready to order? Oh! Miss Crane. As I live and breathe. What-what... what are you doing here? Oh. Hi, guys. Yeah, I always pick up a little extra work over Thanksgiving and Christmas. Ah. Well, um, this is Mr. Tully. Oh, sure. I know you. Angus Tully. We met outside Dr. Woodrup's office. I was wrongly accused of blowing up a toilet. I didn't know about the wrongly part. Um, he'll have a cheeseburger. Okay. And a Miller High Life, please. Uh, no, you will not. Where do you stand on Miller High Life, Miss Crane? Well, like they say, it's the champagne of beers. - And she's a professional. - Okay. Okay, one cheeseburger. - And a Coke. - Okay. I will have a cheeseburger as well. Two cheeseburgers. -And a Jim Beam on the rocks. -Oh. Okay. Please. Okay. You got it, guys. Thank you. Hmm. Ouch. You two have chemistry. Okay. That's the Percodan talking. I don't know, seeing her like this, I think she's pretty attractive. Listen, you hormonal vulgarian, that woman deserves your respect, not your erotic speculation. Well, may I at least go to the bathroom? Sir? You mean the pay phone? -Okay. -Ah. A Coke... -and a double Jim. -Oh. I charged you for a single. Thank you. -Chin-chin. -Mm-hmm. So, how'd you get stuck holding over? I thought it was Mr. Endicott's year. No, I know. Uh, I'm being punished. Yeah, Dr. Woodrup is, um... A pompous ass with a dictator complex? Oops. Um... Uh, what I meant to say was, uh, well, he's a lovely compassionate educator with a really groovy beard. Yeah. You know, I've had a lot of former students ascend to positions of authority. He's the only one I've ever had to report to. -He was your student? -Oh, yes. My first year teaching, and he was an asshole even then. Oh. Well, listen, if you and Angus are really all alone up there, I'm having a little Christmas Eve party. In case, you know, you guys want to stop by. ♪ Oh, my sweetness ♪ ♪ Means you'll meet me in the hallway ♪ ♪ Twice on the pipe ♪ ♪ Means you ain't gonna show ♪ ♪ If you look out your window tonight... ♪ Sorry, kid.

Because I don't want to shoot the other fucking machine. -I want to use this one. -Fuck! Thanks for fucking up my mojo. Hey, Kenny, you're up. Bullshit. I put my dime down. I'm up next.

You want me to take your dime? Like it's, uh... like it's charity? No. What I meant was... we could play together. Yeah, you could be my left arm. The fuck did you just say to me? -Hey! -Mr. Hunham? Mm, yes? -Mr. Hunham, can we go, please? -Why? Uh, I've just been called a fancy little prick. -Hey! Why'd you run off? -We should go. We were just talking to you. Don't they teach you manners at that school? - No, no, no. No, no. - Kenneth! Kenneth, leave him alone. They just came in for some food. Kenneth. Kenneth. Is that right? Uh, I don't doubt he did something to offend you. It's his specialty.

That's one way to look at it. Hey. Catch. How many boys do you know have had their hands blown off? Barton boys don't go to Vietnam. No, they go to Yale or Dartmouth or Cornell, whether they deserve to or not. -Except for Curtis Lamb. -Except for Curtis Lamb. Were you ever in the military? Yes. I tried to enlist in '41, but was rejected. I have to get in over there. They made me an air raid warden. Gave me a whistle and everything. Helmet, armband. Yeah. Before we get going, can I be candid with you? Mm-hmm. You smell. Like fish. And it's really noticeable towards the end of the day. I can even smell it on your coat. Mind if I crack the window? Trimethylaminuria. Huh? Trimethylaminuria. Means my body can't break down trimethylamine. That's the smell. And, uh, yes, more toward the end of the day. Wow. -Your whole life? -Mm-hmm. No wonder you're afraid of women. I am not afraid of women. -Jesus H. Christ. -Sorry. I shouldn't have said anything. Dr. Gertler says I don't always give consideration to my audience. Ah. And who is Dr. Gertler? -My shrink. -Hmm. Has Dr. Gertler ever tried a good, swift kick in the ass? Okay, all right, now your turn. -Hmm. -Go ahead. Tell me something about me. -Something negative. -Something negative about you? Sure. Just one thing. Just one? Why'd you two miss dinner last night? Oh, we went into town on some, uh, school-related business. And you couldn't call? Sorry. Good morning, everybody. -Hi, Danny. -Good morning. You can go on in and fix yourself a plate. Mm, I just saw something funny. I walked into the gym, and someone had vomited in there. You don't say. I don't know anything about that. Yeah. Me, neither. No, uh, I'll look into that right away. Thank you. Mm-hmm. I see how it is. You're out your mind. I appreciate you pitching in. No, no, I should be thanking you. This is very therapeutic. Try it when you're stuck serving 300 little shits, and all they do is complain. Then you tell me how therapeutic it is. Well, fair enough. Mary. Speaking of. Oh, brownies? God, yes. I want all of these. Ah-ah. Just take one. The rest is for the Christmas party tonight. What Christmas party? There's a Christmas party? Yeah, at Miss Crane's house. I'm only going to go for a little bit. Show my face and say I was there. You know, Miss Crane said she invited you too. I want to go to the party. She didn't mean it. We were just making small talk. If you don't want to go, don't go. I'll take him. Mary can take me. No, that's not how it works. You're under my supervision. Okay, maybe it's fine for you to sit around here and read books all day, but I'm losing my goddamn mind. - Jesus! - Hey! Watch your mouth, young man. Not on Christmas Eve. You see? I can't trust him in a social situation. Mr. Hunham, if you're too chickenshit to go to this party, then just say that. -But don't fuck it up for the little asshole. -Mm. What's wrong with you? It's just a party. - What are you afraid of? - I don't know. Shit. Now you got me nervous. Mm. Yeah. -Oh, hi. -Oh, hi. - Oh, you made it. Welcome. - Yes. Hi. Aw. I am so glad you're here. We're happy to be here. Where should I put these? Um, oh. Those, I'll be putting on my bedside table. Oh! You're a wicked woman. -You have no idea. -Oh! Certainly a lot of people here. Yeah, yeah.

Out of the oven and all the trimmings. My mom always just orders in from Delmonico's. Well, she's got the right idea. Next year I'm ordering in from Delmonico's. Anyway, thank you, Mary. You're welcome. I'd like to propose a toast. To my two unlikely companions on this snowy island and to our absent friends and family. And I realize that none of us is here because he wants to be. So if there's any way that I could make the holidays a little cheerier for either one of you, just say the word. Okay. I want to go to Boston. Boston? Why? Why not? I want a real Christmas. I want to go ice-skating. I want to see a real Christmas tree with real ornaments, not that stupid thing. - You said it was nice. - It is nice. Come on, let's get out of here. I want a real holiday. We're not going to Boston. It's out of the question. You told the boy "anything," so take the kid to Boston. Mary, we're not allowed to leave campus or the immediate environs. I suppose we could call it a field trip. Uh, field trips would fall under the ambit of additional academic pursuits. There's even a fund set aside for additional academic pursuits. Mm-hmm. I'll go pack. I'm gonna need you to take me to Roxbury. Mm-hmm. All right. - Here we are. - Hmm. Boy, that's an awful lot of stairs. -Probably icy too. -Mm. Mr. Tully. Right. Um... Mary, can I help you with your bags? Yes, please. Hmm. Mm. Hey, be careful with the box. Yeah. You know, you're more than welcome to a room at the hotel. We've got the money. Are you out of your mind? I need a break from you two and all your damn bickering. Besides, I'm looking forward to visiting my little sister. She's pregnant. Oh, that's wonderful. -Yeah. -Oh. -Mr. Hunham. Mr. Hunham. -Oh, I'm sorry. My hands sweat. It's hyperhidrosis. Sorry. - Oh. - Hey, Mary! One more flight up. One more flight up. Yep. So, you two are going to be all right? Yes, the little monster will be well under control. - Mary! - Oh. Hi! -Bye. -Bye. Bye, Mary. Uh-uh. Where are you going? -I was... -You're not done yet. You have to help me up there. -Yeah, sure thing. -Come on. Hmm. Hey there, handsome. You got a cigarette? Nope. Sorry, I smoke a pipe. How about a date, then? You want a date? No, thank you. -Oh, come on. -Mm-mm-mm. Let's go somewhere warm. Go ahead. - I can wait here. - See? He can wait here, read some books. He doesn't mind if daddy gets a little candy cane. Thank you, but I never really liked candy canes. Plus, I'm prediabetic. You know, if you do want a little candy cane, I won't tell anyone. Mr. Tully, for most people, sex is 99% friction and one percent goodwill. Call me old-fashioned, but I place value on physical intimacy. So should you. You've never had sex, have you? Believe it or not, Mr. Tully, there was a time when the fire in my loins burned white hot. You're full of shit. No, the details would curl your toes. Okay, we're finally getting to the good stuff. Let's hear. Maybe when you're eighteen. Curl your toes! Are we almost done? What's your hurry? I thought you liked antiquity. In class, maybe, but I never think about it unless I need to. Ah. Ah, well, here. What do you see? I don't know. A bunch of pottery. Mm. Look at that one. - Candy cane. - Yes. There's nothing new in human experience, Mr. Tully. Each generation thinks it invented debauchery or suffering or rebellion, but man's every impulse and appetite from the disgusting to the sublime is on display right here all around you. So, before you dismiss something as boring or irrelevant, remember, if you truly want to understand the present or yourself, you must begin in the past. You see, history is not simply the study of the past. It is an explanation of the present. See, when you say it that way and throw in some pornography, it's a lot easier to understand. Okay. You should try doing more of that in class and less yelling. You know, most of the kids dislike you. Pretty much hate you. Teachers too.

Is that you? It's Hugh. Hugh Cavanaugh. Ah, yes. Of course. Wow. Hugh Cavanaugh. Wow. Oh, how are you, Hugh? Oh, God, what's it been, 30 years? Um... Um, this-this is, uh... this is my wife Karen. Honey, this is Paul Hunham. -We went to Harvard together. -Hi, Paul. Yes, we did. Yes, we did. Uh, wow. Uh, what have you been up to, Hugh? - Uh, still in the area? - Oh, yes. Yes. I-I'm still in Boston. Cambridge. -Harvard. -Well... He just got tenure. Statistics. -Oh, Karen. -He won't blow his own horn. -I have to blow it for him. -Okay. Well, uh, what about you, Paul? Oh, still teaching. We have that in common. Uh, history, ancient history. - That's great. - Yes. That's great. Where? Oh, um, abroad, mostly. On fellowships, privately funded fellowships. Universities and private academies. Mostly fellowships, you know. I'm currently posted in, um, Antwerp. Uh, just back here for the holidays. Ah. So, uh, is this your son? -Well, um... -I'm his nephew, Leonard. Nice to meet you, Leonard. And he's writing a book right now. Um, tell him about your book, Uncle Paul. My book. It's not a book, really. Uh, more of a monograph. -It's nothing special. -Don't be so modest. It's about, uh, cameras, right? Ancient cameras? - Oh. - Yes. No, what he means, of course, is the camera obscura. You know, the optical and astronomical tool that dates back to the time of, um, Anaxagoras. Tell him the title, Uncle Paul. He's not interested, Leonard. Sure, I am. Light and Magic in the Ancient World. Okay, well, um... Paul, I'm just so glad you landed on your feet. You look swell. You too. So swell. And, uh, we'll keep an eye out for your book. -Won't we, honey? -Yeah. -Merry Christmas, Paul. -Merry Christmas. -Bye, Leonard. -Merry Christmas. What the fuck just happened? I thought Barton men don't lie. Don't get me wrong, that was fun, but you just lied through your teeth. What I say during a private conversation is none of your goddamn business. You are not to judge me. It wasn't a private conversation. The wife and I were there. And I helped you. Why did he ask if you landed on your feet? What is this, Nuremberg? -Jesus. -You're the hard-ass constantly telling everybody not to lie and going on and on about the honor code. There was an incident when I was at Harvard with my roommate. And? He accused me of copying from his senior thesis. Plagiarizing. Ah. -Well, did you? -No, he stole from me. But that blue-blooded prick's family had allies on the faculty. I mean, their last name is on a library, for Christ's sake. So he accused me in order to sanitize his treachery and, uh, they threw me out. Wait, so you got kicked out of Harvard for cheating? No, I got kicked out of Harvard for hitting him. You hit him? What, like punched him out? No, I hit him with a car. Ah. You got kicked out of Harvard for hitting a guy with a car? By accident. Pint of Jim Beam, please. But he broke three ribs, which was technically his fault because he shouldn't have been in the road. Two dollars, please. Also, he shat himself. Which was the greater indignity. Here you go, killer. So Mr. Hunham never even graduated college? - Mm. - Holy shit. You didn't finish up somewhere else? Who else knows? Well, Dr. Greene knew. Only Dr. Greene. He always believed in me, so he gave me a job. Adjunct faculty, zero respect and even less pay. So nobody batted an eye, and I've been at the school ever since. Are you ashamed at how things turned out? Not at all. I'm proud of my work. I love history. I love Barton. Barton is my life. I don't know what I would do without Barton. Why'd you lie to that guy? Because I knew he'd relish the fact that I'm a washout and never left my own high school, and he'd probably repeat that story to everybody we used to know, so I figured he's not entitled to my story. I am. Yeah. Yeah, fuck that guy. Yeah, exactly. Fuck that guy. "Statistics." But, now, you'll keep this quiet, right? No one is to know. I mean no one, Angus. Entre nous, sir. Entre nous. "Ancient cameras." Where the hell did you come up with that? Just trying to keep you on your toes, sir. Get up, kid. It's daylight in the swamp. I ordered breakfast. Great. Oh, you dropped something. Uh, those are my vitamins. Librium. Yeah, it's just, uh, something I'm supposed to take for low energy. You mean depression? Is that rye toast? How'd you know I like rye toast? All right. This way. Let go lightly. -Ah. -You're too rigid. See? -You're welcome. -Not bad. You're a pretty good teacher, kid. Too bad everybody dislikes you. Pretty much hates you. But you must know that, right? Touché, sir. Touché. -By the way... -Yeah? ...what eye do you aim with, anyway? Ah. You know, I've been meaning to ask. When we're talking, which one should I look at? Sometimes I look at one, but then I think I'm wrong, so I look at the other. Yes, everybody does that. So, which eye is it? People don't understand. This isn't tenpin. No, this is much harder. All these tenpin assholes coming in here like they're slumming it. The hell with them. Yeah. Fuck 'em. Excuse me. Here's something I bet you didn't know. Your uniform, festive as it is, is historically inaccurate. Saint Nicholas of Myra was actually a fourth-century Greek Bishop from what is now Turkey. So, uh, a robe and sandals would be closer to the mark. Yeah, but I guess that would be impractical given the weather and all the silly but lucrative mythology about Santa and elves and reindeer and chimneys and whatnot. What can you do? As Democritus said, "O kósmos alloíosis, o víos ypólipsis." "World is decay. Life is perception." My son. To see you again causes my heart to soar like a hawk. Grandfather, I brought you this present. Is this the hat I used to own? Except grown softer... You know, this is not only amusing, uh, but for a movie, it's a fairly accurate depiction of life among the Cheyenne. -Shh! -Fuck off. I saw you in a dream. -I'm gonna go use the bathroom. -Mm-hmm. You were drinking from a spring that came from the long nose of an animal. I did not recognize the animal. Alongside his nose, he grew two horns. ...and smoked on this matter, and my decision is... Little Big Man has returned. Hey! Hey! No. Out. Get out. I just need to do something. I was going to come back. Or meet you at the hotel. It won't take long. It's nothing bad. Just get out, you conniving little shit. Were you planning this the whole time? Just counting the minutes until I turned my back? I wasn't running away. There's just something I need to do before we go back to school. Please. You could come with me. Just come with me, okay? Come with you where? To see my dad. Your dad? That's what this is about? Why didn't you just ask me? Because, of course, we can visit a cemetery. Excuse me. Hi. I'm here to see Thomas Tully. Right in here. Over here. Look who's here to see you. Hi, Dad. Hello, sweetheart. You want to go sit down for a little? Oh. Come on. Be seated right here. There you go. All right. I missed you. I've missed you a lot. A whole lot. You know, I'm still at school. At Barton. And it's, uh... it's Christmastime now, so I thought you might like a visit. Guess what. I'm... I'm actually keeping my grades up. I-I consistently get the highest grades in the class in ancient civ. I'm... I'm pretty much third or fourth in precalc. And I'm in the chess club too. But I don't really like the other kids. And in the spring, I think I want to try tennis. Just JV, and probably only doubles, if the coach could just forget about my, uh... Anyway, it's not important. Listen. I, uh... I have to tell you something. I think they're putting something in my food. He used to be fine. He was better than fine. He was great. He was my dad. Then about four years ago, he... started acting strange. Erratic, forgetful, saying all this weird shit. My mom took him to a bunch of doctors, and they put him on medication. But that just made it worse. He got more confused. Then he got angry. And then he got... physical. That was it. That was the last straw. They put him away. And she divorced him... without him even realizing it. That's why she wants a whole new life. And it's easy to just stash me away in boarding school. Like half of us are just stashed away there. And I get it. She never has to look at me. Because maybe when she looks at me, she... -she sees him. -No, no, no, no, no. That can't be true. She... You're her son. Maybe she's right. I can't keep it together. I lie. I steal. I piss people off. I don't have any friends, real friends. I'll probably get kicked out of Barton too. And when I do, it'll be my own fault. Get sent to Fork Union and maybe to you-know-where. And nobody will care. The funny thing is... I wanted to see him so bad this whole time. But I also didn't, you know? Because I'm afraid that's what's going to happen to me one day. No, Angus, Angus. Angus, listen. You're not your father. How do you know? Because no one is his own father. I'm not my dad. No matter how hard he tried to beat that idea into me. I find the world a bitter and complicated place, and it seems to feel the same way about me. I think you and I have this in common. But don't get me wrong, you have your challenges. You're erratic and belligerent and a gigantic pain in the balls, but you're not your father. You're your own man. Man, no. You're just a kid. You're just beginning. And you're smart. You've got time to turn things around. Yes, I know the Greeks had the idea that, uh, the steps you take to avoid your fate are the very steps that lead you to it, but that's just a literary conceit. In real life, your history does not have to dictate your destiny... Oh. There's Mary. Can you not tell Mary or anybody? Uh... Entre nous. This whole goddamned trip is entre nous. -Stand up. -What? Stand up for the lady, you boor. You cretin. - Mary. - Well, hello. Hi. Sorry I'm late. Oh, we're just happy to see you. Madame, the menu. Oh. Thank you. Hello, ma'am. Would you like a cocktail to start? Oh, no, I'll just take a cup of tea. Oh, come on. Have a cocktail. No, no, no. A cup of tea is fine. I've eaten already. And you gentlemen, did you save room for dessert? - Hmm. - Hey, what's that? That's our signature dessert. - Cherries jubilee. - Mmm. That sounds great. Bring the young vandal here cherries jubilee. I'm afraid I can't. The dish contains brandy. Same deal with the bananas Foster. -Yeah, but doesn't the alcohol just burn off? -Mm. It's still against the rules, ma'am. -Fine. -Oh. I'll order the cherries jubilee. We can share it. Mm. I can't allow that, either. Can we say it's his birthday? It's my birthday. Well, happy birthday, young man. Let's get you a slice of cake or some other age-appropriate dessert. Christ on a crutch. What kind of a fascist hash foundry are you running here? Uh, excuse me, ma'am. Do you, by chance, have cherries? Yes. Great. And do you have ice cream? - Yes. - Fantastic. Can we please get cherries and ice cream to go? And the check. Right away. -Bitch. -Mm. And a little James Beam. All right. Go ahead. Ooh. Presto. Cherries jubilee. Ooh. -Shouldn't it just go out? -Okay. Oh, shit. Shit. -How much alcohol did you put on there? -Oh! It's hot. It's very hot. Oh! But now just listen to them. They see the ball and... Man, I sure do wish we had some noisemakers. Mm-hmm. I've got a noisemaker. Where the hell did you get that? I don't know. Found it. Well, you're not deploying that in here. You know, you weren't this uptight in Boston. Oh. Danny, where do you stand on indoor fireworks? About as far away as I can. - That's very wise. - Ten, nine... Oh, we're gonna miss it. Come on. -Up on your feet. -...eight, seven... Up on your feet. Up on your feet. -...six, five, four... -Five, four... Three, two, one. -Happy New Year! -Happy New Year! Yes. ♪ Should old acquaintance be forgot... ♪ Congratulations, Mr. Tully. -Congratulations, Danny. -Thank you. Mary, congratulations. Now, as I say, we're not deploying this in here. No. We're going to light this sucker off in the kitchen. -What? -What? All right. Come. -Come, come, come. -Come on, man. -For real? -This is coming with me. ♪ For auld lang syne ♪ ♪ My dear ♪ ♪ For auld lang syne. ♪ There's too much paprika. Why'd you put in all that paprika? Follow the recipe. Now you have to add in another cup of water. What's wrong with you? Come on, ladies! Hey, Kountze. Does... does it hurt? Fuck yeah, it hurts. Glare off the slopes, man, burned me to a crisp. You think that's funny, Tully? No, man. Just glad you had a good vacation. Welcome back, you snarling Visigoths. I trust you all enjoyed a refreshing holiday. Oh, hello, Mr. Kountze. Or should I say Icarus? Fly a little too close to the sun, did we? Huh? Yeah. Uh, all right. Now, along with your skiing and swimming, I hope you found time to enlighten yourselves about the Peloponnesian War and its implications for today. Just to check, we're going to start with a short pop quiz on the reading... ...before we retake the final from last semester. Omnia ex scrineis praeter stilum. Excuse me, Mr. Hunham? Oh, Miss Crane. Lydia. Uh, come in. Happy New Year. Oh, same to you. Happy New Year. Forgive me. I'm a clod. I never called to thank you for inviting the boy and me to your party. And Mary. It meant a lot. Oh, you're so welcome. It was fun. Um, Dr. Woodrup is asking to see you. He says it's urgent. Oh. Mr. Hunham, meet Judy and Stanley Clotfelter. Angus Tully's mother and father. -Stepfather. -Hello. Good morning. They've brought something very important to my attention. We understand you took Angus to Boston over the holidays. I explained to Mr. Clotfelter that you went on a field trip for academic reasons. That's right. A field trip? Yes. Uh, as per my instructions in the manual, it fell within the ambit of my responsibility. Well, if it was a school trip, then how do you explain this? The people at the sanitarium confiscated it from my ex-husband. Apparently, Angus had given it to him. My mom and Stanley are here. Lydia told me. I think I'm going to get kicked out. That means military school. Angus knows he's not supposed to visit his father. He suffers from debilitating mental illness. Paranoid schizophrenia, early-onset dementia. And Angus's visit created an expectation. Now Tom wants to come home, which is... clearly impossible. They tried to tell him, and he just... He got violent. He tried to brain one of the orderlies with this goddamned thing. You people know the boy has a discipline problem. Paul, the Clotfelters want to withdraw Angus from Barton and enroll him at Fork Union Military Academy. Set him straight once and for all. He could do a lot worse than a career in the military. Stanley. Look, Angus has defied me lots of times about a lot of things, including this. So, however he manipulated your sympathies or slipped the leash, just tell us. It was my idea. No, uh, uh, he didn't, uh, trick me or slip the leash. No, I took him to see his father. In fact, I convinced him to do so. This is a family matter, and you had no right to interfere. - I don't give a shit. - What? - Hunham. - I said I don't give a shit. You two were unreachable. He was all alone at Christmas. I thought the kid should see his father. Do you understand what you've done? I have to move Tom now. It was hard even finding a facility that would take him, and now I have to move him. And that is deeply unfortunate, but why compound the misery by ruining the boy? I have just spent two solid weeks with him. He is a pain in the ass, sure, but he's also very smart. Brilliant, I don't know, but very smart. You must know that. He's got enormous potential. It would be devastating if you pulled him out now. You did this to yourself, Hunham, not me. -I want you to remember that. -Mm. Hardy, I have known you since you were a boy, so I think I have the requisite experience and insight to aver that you are and always have been penis cancer in human form. It's this one. This is the one you should look at. Angus, step inside, please. -Oh. -Hello. Hello. I missed you at breakfast. I was, uh... I was busy. So did you decide where you're going to go? Yes and no. Um, first, I'm going to stash my stuff at a friend's in Syracuse, and then... I don't know. Maybe I'll start in Carthage. I was hoping you were going to say that. Mm. For your monograph. I don't know, Mary. There's a lot of empty pages in here. Yeah, well, that's your problem, man. All you got to do is write one word after another. Can't be that hard, can it? Oh... What about you? What about me what? Oh, no, I'm not going anywhere. Mm-mm. I'm not like you. I like having a job. Plus, I'm saving up for college. My sister's baby. Ah. What is the word from Penny? -Peggy. -Peggy. Only that if it's a boy... ...his middle name is going to be Curtis. I heard he got booted for eating feces. What? Apparently he got caught in the locker room. Hand in the commode, burgling turds. That's not what I heard. What did you hear? Doesn't matter. Either way, he's history. Fucker taught history, now is history. Right, Tully? Hi. Oh, hi. Look, uh... I don't know what you said to my mom and Stanley, Woodrup, but... all I know is I'm not getting kicked out and, uh, you got fired. Well, I just told the truth. Mostly. Barton man. Barton man. Fifth period. You know, it's, uh... it's only PE. Maybe I could skip. We could head over to The Winning Ticket. Grab a burger and a beer. Ah. Miller High Life, no doubt. You never give up, do you? Well, they already fired you, so I figured it was worth a shot. Your logic is flawless, but, uh, no. Keep your head up, all right? You can do this. Yeah, I was gonna tell you the same thing. See ya. See ya. ♪ Crying ♪ ♪ Crying never did nobody no good no how ♪ ♪ That's why I ♪ ♪ I don't cry ♪ ♪ That's why I ♪ ♪ I don't cry ♪ ♪ Laughing ♪ ♪ Laughing sometimes does somebody some good somehow ♪ ♪ That's why I ♪ ♪ I'm laughing now ♪ ♪ That's why I ♪ ♪ I'm laughing now ♪ ♪ Loving ♪ ♪ Loving never did me ♪ ♪ No good no how ♪ ♪ No how ♪ ♪ That's why I ♪ ♪ Can't love you now ♪ ♪ That's why I ♪ ♪ Can't love you now ♪ ♪ Lying ♪ ♪ Lying never did nobody no good no how ♪ ♪ No how ♪ ♪ So why am I ♪ ♪ Lying now? ♪ ♪ So why am I ♪ ♪ Lying now? ♪
