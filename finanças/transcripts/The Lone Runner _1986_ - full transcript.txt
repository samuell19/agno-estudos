[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] -Father? -Hmm? Why have we come to a place that's so empty? Oh my dear. Don't worry about it. We're not going to come out and live in the middle of the desert. I've made enough money to retire in comfort. And our new house will be just as nice as the old one. ANALISA: But I still don't understand. Why aren't there any people here? Well, I mean, I don't know I'm afraid. Perhaps, Ms. Gunn might know. Do you know, Ms. Gunn? Know what, Mr. Summerking? Analisa wants to know why there are no people in the middle of the desert. [CHUCKLES] Oh, but there are. There are a lot of people. Only you can't see them because they're all hiding. [GASPS] Hiding? Oh, where? Everywhere, everywhere. Behind the rocks and under the sand, they're all around us. Really, Ms. Gunn. Why do you stuff the child's mind -with such nonsense? -Oh, Mr. Hodson, you may be an excellent butler, but I would beg you not to interfere with my education of Analisa. My information comes from an impeccable source. As I was saying, now, these people that live under the sand are a tribe called Malakuts. Their leader is a wild fanatic man known as Skorm and his assistant, his name Nimbus. The Malakuts are very wicked men. ANALISA: Ms. Gunn, is everybody in the desert wicked? Oh, no, no, no, no, no, there are many tribes around here. Some are bad and some are very gentle and kind like the Beriwents they go around looking everywhere for water. And they have a friend who helps them. Our hero. Our wonderful man called Lone Runner. He is a dashing, strong, brave figure. Oh, so noble and generous of heart. He would come and help anybody in trouble. [HORSE NEIGHS] MAN: Who are you? What do you want? MISHA: I'm Misha. MAN: Out of the way. Out of the way I say. Just one second. [HORSE NEIGHS] MISHA: Hey. [CHUCKLES] Welcome to my humble emporium. What can poor Misha for you today? I have goods suited to everyone's fancy. What, what about a toy or a trinket for the young lady, eh? Or, or a nice shawl for your lovely wife? [LAUGHS] I have an excellent extractor of cactus and camel dung, perfect for soothing tired joints. Oh, no. We don't want anything at the moment, thank you. Can you just move that beast out of the way? Is he a Malakut, Ms. Gunn? Once and for all, Analisa. These Mali--what's its. Are mere figment -of someone's imagination. -Oh. HODSON: They simply do not exist. Is that clear? -[GASPS] -[GASPS] The Malakuts. The Malakuts? The Malakuts? The Malakuts? We got to get out of here. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] [SCREAMS] Get out of here. Leave us alone. GUNN: Get your leg off of me. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAMS] Get out of here. GUNN: Get out! ANALISA: Don't touch me! [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] Lord heavens. What we'll be come about? Ms. Gunn, Ms. Gunn, where is he? Where is The Lone Runner? [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [EXPLOSION] [HORSE NEIGHS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [GRUNTS] Ms. Gunn, it's The Lone Runner. [GASPS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [GRUNTING] [SCREAMS] [HORSE NEIGHS] [GASPS] Are you really The Lone Runner? GUNN: Of course, he is. You're The Lone Runner, aren't you? My name's Garrett. Well, Mr. Garrett, whoever you are we can't thank you enough. Can I offer a reward? I have wealth to share, a sovereigns, a hundred sovereigns. Ten sovereigns. But you just saved three lives. -Ten sovereigns... -Ten sovereigns. Very well, if you insist. I'll get my sovereigns. I got it. SUMMERKING: Oh, thank you, Analisa. The diamonds? They're, they're, they're gone. They've been stolen. Oh. GARRETT: Well, well, if it isn't my old friend Misha. Hmm. What a pleasant surprise. Uh-hmm. You wouldn't happen to know anything about those diamonds, would you? No, no. I bet you'd like to help us find them. [MUMBLES] Good. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [HORSE NEIGHS] [HORSES GALLOPING] MAN: The money. Here it is. Get her tomorrow when she goes riding. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] Good morning. I hope you're right about this. It could be a hell of a risk. If I'm right, I'm rich. And if I'm wrong, nothing ventured, nothing gained. Come on. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] [HORSES GALLOPING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [GROANS] No. No. No. Let me go. [GROANS] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] You worry too much, Garrett. [CHUCKLES] It's amazing to me nobody's tried it sooner. I told you, the stories about those diamonds could just be made up. No one's ever seen them. Listen to me. I haven't spent the last two years of my life in this godforsaken desert to end up as a caretaker, the diamonds are there. It's a sure thing. Hiyah! Hiyah! WOMAN: Mr. Emerick, Mr. Emerick, Master Summerking wants to see you. EMERICK: Hiyah! Hiyah! [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Ho. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Emerick, they've taken my daughter. See what they want. I'll standby any agreement you make but just get her back. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] MASOUD: Ho. I have decided. I want 50, no, 100 gold sovereigns. You, the man in black, we will meet in three days' time in the north desert, place known as Angel's Bluff. Come alone or I'll give the girl to my men and I shall feed what's left of her to the vultures. [LAUGHS] Yes. I think a hundred gold sovereigns is a fair price. [LAUGHS] Ho! Ho! Ha! Ha! Ho, ha, ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! You don't think they'll hurt her? Masoud's a thief, not a murder, besides if Summerking has those diamonds, nothing is going to keep me from getting them. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] MAN: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [HORSE NEIGHS] MAN: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] MAN: Just need water. We need water. We need water. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Water. The water. The water. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [HORSE NEIGHING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [EXPLOSION] [CAMEL GROWLS] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] You want the rope, you take the rope, my dear. Normally it is 200 dirhams but for you not two hundred, not one hundred, not fifty, but six dirhams and you have the rope for nothing, my dear. You cut me free and we be even, eh? Three weeks ago, I sold them this [INDISTINCT]. They said, "Is it the rain god?" I said, "Could be, could be." A [INDISTINCT] means many things to many people. And in desert it don't rain and they do this to me. What do I know about rain gods, eh? You take the knife, you take the knife, you cut me down, we'll be friends, I make a great meal, you cut me down. Take the knife, my dear. You have that knife there as a present, my dear. Do you want me to do this gift to you? They say I'd cheat, I'm not a cheat, I don't cheat. No, not me. What are you looking at? Uh, I see one of my humble wares desirable. I'll cut your hands off your stinking desert rat when I get that from you. Stop! Come back! Come back! A deal is a deal. Come back! All right. You win. No. No. Stop. Don't give that to the boy. Cut me down. Cut me down. Stop. Come back. All right. You win. I know something that will interest you. You cut me down and I'll tell you all right. All right. You win. Summerking's daughter, Analisa, has been kidnapped, all right? [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] MISHA: Now cut me down. A deal is a deal, isn't it? I don't give out gifts, the ropes, the knives, the bow and arrows, that's 950 dirhams. You owe me, and no discounts! SUMMERKING: Something really has to be done and done very, very quickly. It's important. All right. Go. Emerick, you know Mr. Faqua. Uh-huh. Well? This man Masoud is a lunatic. But is Analisa all right? What does he want? EMERICK: I'm sure she'll be alright if we give him what he wants, but I don't know what that is. He said he wanted diamonds. I offered him the gold sovereigns but he kept screaming diamonds, I want the diamonds, all the diamonds. Do you know what he means by that, sir? I guess it was only a question of time before my family would get done in by their fortune. Unbelievable. SUMMERKING: Yes, they are beautiful, one thousand in all. And I was fooling myself all this time that nobody knew. But I guess the best thing to do is to take the diamonds and head right out. No. Wait. As Mr. Summerking's banker, I must advise the need for some sort of insurance. EMERICK: Of course Mr. Faqua. You're right. Give me one hundred, no but-- Give me two hundred gold sovereigns as a show of good faith for Masoud, a sort of deposit. There's an abandoned marsh three miles from here. I don't understand. EMERICK: Send the man there to wait. Perhaps it might be you, Mr. Faqua. I will have Masoud accompany me while I bring Analisa to the tower. Then, you and he... can wait with her while I come for the diamonds. I don't think he'll accept this. EMERICK: Of course, he will. I think that for a thousand diamonds, there's very little a man wouldn't do. FAQUA: If I may suggest Mr. Summerking and I agree on some signal from when I see Analisa's all right. EMERICK: Yes. An excellent idea. Anything but just get Analisa back. EMERICK: I assure you Mr. Summerking. I will stop at nothing. Now, with your permission, I'll take the gold and be on my way. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] So you actually saw the diamonds? All one thousand of them. This is easier than we hope. We're really going to do this? Just consider it done. We both better get some rest. It's at least two days ride to Angel's Bluff. Feel lucky? [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Nothing is going to stop us now. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] All right. It's all right. Yeah. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Go see, go see. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] I'll give it to you if you open the lock. Open the lock. Open the lock please. No, wait. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Hmm. It will take more than this to buy your freedom. My father will hang you in the Bedouin. Think about it. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [WIND HOWLING] -SKORM: Are you ready, men? -[INDISTINCT CHATTER] -SKORM: Ready to attack? -[INDISTINCT CHATTER] SKORM: Remember, I want Summerking's daughter alive. Nimbus, I heard everything. We were under the sand. When Masoud met Summerking's men. And that stupid Bedouin didn't know that the girl's father has diamonds, one thousands of them, all he wanted was only gold sovereigns. So we'll attack Masoud's camp tonight and we'll get that girl, because it will make us all rich. Do you realize what that means? We'll be tremendously rich. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [WIND HOWLING] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [LAUGHTER] Eat. No. [HORSE GALLOPING] [GRUNTS] [LAUGHTER] [TRIBAL MUSIC PLAYING] Kill them all. Move it. [GRUNTS] [CROW SQUAWKING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] You will eat. [SCREAMS] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Silence. Silence. Tomorrow we're all rich. Rich. Rich. Rich. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [LAUGHTER] Silence, silence. Cheers to the bitch who will make us rich. [TRIBAL MUSIC PLAYING] [GROANS] [GROANS] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] I can't wait to put my hands on those diamonds. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [CHOKING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [GROANS] [SNORING] ANALISA: Garrett, The Lone Runner. This is the second time you've saved my life. You know when I was a child I used to dream of being saved by you again. But why did you do it? Why did you save me? For the money? Don't you ever talk? I can ride. I'm sure you can. [WHISTLES] [HORSE NEIGHING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Where are you taking me Garrett? Where do you wanna go? I have a friend waiting for me at Angel's Bluff. Someone will pay for this. Whoever it is will surely go to the appointment at Angel's Bluff. Angel's Bluff. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAMING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] What happened to Masoud? Why didn't he come himself? If you mean the Bedouin... he's dead. Dead? What happened to him? It means he's dead Emerick, I'm in no particular mood to mourn the fact. Garrett here saved my life, give him something for his trouble and take me home. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] ANALISA: The Malakuts. -Hiyah! -Hiyah! After them! [SUSPENSE MUSIC PLAYING] [GROANS] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] SKORM: So, you stole the girl from me. Now where are the diamonds? EMERICK: What diamond? I don't know what you're talking about. [WHIPPING] [GROANS] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] How much will you give me for this beautiful bracelet? Hey. Where did you get this? A fair trade, it's mine. Tell me where you got it? The Malakuts, it was a fair trade. Don't take it, it's mine. Stop him, he's a thief. Stop him! 2000 for the bracelet and you'll never get a discount from me. You throw my hospitality in my face with your pin-sized minds you think you can outwit me? I am Skorm the Malakut, I am king, leader, big boss. You'll not be harmed if you stay with us. But first we must get to like each other. Get away from her you stinking pig. You, I'll break you. You stole her because you didn't wanna pay. I know what your game is. What are you talking about? Do you know what happens to someone who cheats a Malakut? Have you the slightest idea? I will show you. Nimbus. Proceed. [LAUGHS] SKORM: It worked. It worked. It worked. It worked. It worked. It worked. It worked. It worked. It worked. -Look. -What is it? It could be a bag of gold. Gold? Hey. Bring it to me. Don't open it. You hear? Just hand it to me. I'll open it myself. -Gold. -Oh. This is a good omen. Gold. Gold. The gods are with us. [LAUGHS] We're going to be rich. We're going to be rich. Rich. Yes, dear friends. Slowly. Slowly. There's enough for all of you. This is only the beginning. A taste of what's going to come. -Skorm! -SKORM: Huh? After them! [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Halt. [EXPLOSIONS] Forward. [EXPLOSIONS] We'll need this. We should get an early start in the morning. Where you heading? I thought I'd tag along with you. That's a good idea. Maybe we'll finally get home. Don't worry about it. We'll be fine from here. But I would like to pay you for your trouble. You don't owe me anything. I just wanna make sure you both get home safe and sound. [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] Where is he? -Who? -Your friend. The stranger. That's who. He's gone. Is that worrying you a lot? No. What worries me is who is and what he wants. How do we know he isn't one of the kidnappers? If you don't know, Emerick, how should I know? EMERICK: Oh, really? And what exactly is that supposed to mean? Now, you listen to me. Don't forget my father is paying you. So from now on, I'll give you the orders. Now... will you please take me home? But this time, we'll take the road that I tell you. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [EXPLOSIONS] Tell me about it. Let me out of here. Stakes must be pretty higher for a man to risk murder. You're crazy. Maybe. EMERICK: No. Wait. Listen. Maybe we could make a deal. Bet on it. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] -SKORM: Where's the girl? -She's gone. What do you mean gone? Back to the camp. -No wait. -I said back to the camp. EMERICK: No. No. Wait. No. Hurry up. EMERICK: She's with Garrett, and you need me to get to her. Now, let me out of here and I'll make a deal with you. I'll make a deal you. -No. -Okay. Are you ready? No. Don't. No. Surprise. Do you really wanna get the girl? Hmm? Well, there's a way but we'll have to do it together. You know how to use this? -Uh-hmm. -Stay out of sight. Garrett. Good luck. Thanks. [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] [EXPLOSION] Right there. After them. Leave me alone. Up there. [EXPLOSIONS] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] There he is. Watch this. Hello, Garrett. It's so nice to see you again. Where is Analisa, huh? Now, you're my prisoner. And you're going to die. You are so incredibly stupid. Incredibly stupid? -EMERICK: Yes. -Me? We have to find out where the girl is before the poison kills him. So what are you standing around for? -Find her. -Go. And, now, where is she? Hmm? Where is she? [GROANS] You're not gonna tell me, are you? I wanna know. Where is she? I knew you were trouble the minute I laid my eyes on you. What do we do with him? He's history. I'll find the girl, and I'll bring her back here myself. [GROWLS] EMERICK: Nimbus... don't forget, keep everyone out of sight. [HORSE NEIGHS] EMERICK: Hyah. Hyah. I don't like him. I'll fix him. Bring him back. [HORSES NEIGH] [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] [HORSE SNORTS] [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAMS] [GROANS] [WIND BLOWING] [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAMS] [BAT SHRIEKS] [SCREAMS] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] ANALISA: Let go of me, you filthy slimes. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] MISHA: [CHUCKLES] Well, look who's here? My old friend. What happened to you, eh? [LAUGHS] You don't look very good. I need your camel. Sure. What have you got to trade, huh? [GROANS] [COUGHS] Your life if you're lucky. EMERICK: What are you doing? Leave her alone, you fools. Don't you understand? Summerking will never let us have the diamonds. So the girl must not be harmed. Release her. Stop. SKORM: All right. We leave at dawn. No tricks, otherwise... [MAKES SOUND] We'll just cut your throats and forget the whole thing. He doesn't trust you. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [HORSE TROTTING] [HORSE NEIGHS] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] When you look at me, you might think I am a philosopher. You would be wrong. [LAUGHS] When I was at school, my teacher simply say to me, "Misha, you should,"-- but that is another story. You are not the sort of person who would take a poor man's camel and give him nothing in return, are you? Are you? Probably you'll give me... Seven percent. Seven percent? Are you crazy? You take my camel and my gold. Fifty percent. Oh, you make a joke. Yes. You make a joke. [LAUGHS] I am laughing. Do you hear me? All right. Forty percent. My final, final offer, 25%, and that's final. All right. All right. Ten percent. [CRIES] It's a deal. Ten percent of what? [HORSES TROTTING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [GRUNTING] [GROANING] Hey, look at those horses. MAN: Yeah. But where are the men? MAN: I don't know. They must have been attacked. MAN: By who? ANALISA: What are you doing? Keep away from me. GARRETT: Be quiet. It's me. -Garrett. -Go back there and look for them. ANALISA: Hurry. [MAN GROANS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Whoa. The girl's escaping. [MAN GROANS] Go on after her. Come on. [MAN GRUNTS] ANALISA: Let go off me. You scum. [GRUNTS] Now, where do you think you're going? Home. I think we should all go home. NIMBUS: Shouldn't we wait for Skorm? EMERICK: Hmm, It won't be necessary. I'm sure he'll find his way. All right. Let's go. [ANALISA GRUNTING] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [MAN GRUNTS] [SKORM CHUCKLES] Well, well, well. The Lone Runner. [CHUCKLES] Invulnerable, huh? Hmm? Well then, let's see. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [GRUNTING] [CHUCKLING] [GROANS] [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] EMERICK: Whoa. [HORSE NEIGHS] EMERICK: All right. Move to your positions and stay out of sight. Let's go. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [HORSE NEIGHS] Mr. Farquhar. ANALISA: Hyah. Get her, damn it. Hyah. [HORSE NEIGHS] [HORSES GALLOPING] [GASPS] [GROANS] EMERICK: No. You idiot. -[MAN GROANS] -EMERICK: I needed him alive. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS] [ANALISA GRUNTING] EMERICK: Make no mistake about this. From here on out, you do exactly what I say or you'll never see the diamonds. Understand me? And you, Analisa... what am I gonna do with you, hmm? [SPITS] I can't believe it. I treated this man as my son. How could he betray me like this? What a fool I am. Do you know I even thought of him as a possible husband for my daughter? Can you explain it? The diamonds. SUMMERKING: He must be exposed as a scoundrel. He must be shown for what he is. He will pay for this. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [HORSE SNORTS] [LAUGHTER] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -[ANALISA GRUNTS] -[MAN GROANS] GARRETT: Hello, boys? [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] ANALISA: What are you doing? We have to get there before Emerick or my father will give him the diamonds. [MISHA GROANS] You think we could try shaking hands sometimes instead? Good evening, madam. -[COUGHS] -GARRETT: There's something I'd like for you to do. Oh, no. [GROANS] Ten percent. Ten percent of what? [GROANS] I trust you. I trust you. SUMMERKING: Emerick. Oh, it's good to see you. And it's good to see you, sir. Hmm, who is this? This... is my good friend. The one who planned all this. I don't understand. What are you doing? Don't worry. You'll get your diamonds as soon as we get Analisa. That's right. MAN: Where are you going? You can't go in there. MISHA: Get out of my way. What is that? I don't wanna be disturbed. -MAN: What's happening here? -MISHA: Get out of my way. Hurry. The diamonds. MISHA: Let go of me. -They have Analisa. -MISHA: Let go of me, I say. MAN: [INDISTINCT] MISHA: Get out of here. Get out of my way. -Hurry. -MISHA: I said get out of my way. Get out of here. I too am a busy man. Where do you want this rug here? All right. [GRUNTS] There's a girl in this rug. Hello, Emerick. Analisa. The game's over. ANALISA: Garrett, watch out. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [HORSE NEIGHS] EMERICK: Hyah. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [GROWLS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Analisa, thank God you're all right. [GROWLS] [GRUNTING] [GROANING] It's been a pleasure doing business with you. [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] [HORSE NEIGHS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [MAKES SOUND] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Water. Water. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] No, no, no. [HORSE SNORTS] Diamonds. The diamonds. The diamonds. [HORSE NEIGHS] EMERICK: The diamonds. My diamonds! Will we ever see him again? Oh, I'm sure. He's a friend. A good, good friend. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Ten percent of what? Maybe a gold mine. It could be a... maybe 10% of a palm tree or it's coconut. It might be 10% of a [INDISTINCT]. I'd be making genuine [INDISTINCT] overnight, oh, that would be wonderful. My God, it's him. No, don't look. Delilah, pretend you haven't seen him. No, don't look. [CHUCKLES] [GASPS] My 10%. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING]
