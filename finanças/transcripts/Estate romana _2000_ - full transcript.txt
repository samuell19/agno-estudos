Be careful of the sun, it can hurt you I'm always afraid of the sun on my skin I think it burns you It's bad... but we are the ones who made it bad It seems like one of those spiders who first wove a beautiful web and then got angry Yes, we must move slowly because he's very angry Not only is the sun angry, the waters are angry as well Fire is angry, the earth is angry The wind is the most angry of all - The wind is furious at times - Furious, yes... I'm waiting for what it must tell me Tell me if there is something I can defend myself from One thing only: Fear. Defend yourself from fear but don't be afraid of fear. If you're afraid of fear you're done for already I understand In order to rid yourself of everything else let yourself be invaded by love. - So, it's a loss then - It's a discovery. I mean... if you lose autonomy, you acquire liberty. - There's little liberty here - Very little, that's true - Too many concepts - It's too full. - There is liberty here - Yes, there is some liberty here One can breathe, as you said before True, there's some liberty in nature We cannot have the liberty that we desire until we allow ourselves to taken by that liberty And that is only love It's six thirty in the morning I thought you'd call at least You're right. I'm sorry I didn't tell you It's changed - What's changed? - Rome So have you, so has this house The problem is what I'm going to do now My assistant, Cerasella, will be here in a few hours You'll want to sleep well We'll go in there, you on the couch and me over here No, it makes me nervous You won't want this room. Come over here I'll put a big note on the door and tell my assistant to come later Take off your shoes or stay as you like. I'll see you later. Salvatore! Peppe is on the phone Wake up! It's Peppe, the set designer I never get any sleep around here, what is it... Hello? Oh hi Peppe, Yes, I was working I still can't do it this afternoon, Peppe... I'm still trying to finish Earth All the other planets are done, only Earth is left I still need another day or two of serious work on it What did he say? He wants the set the day after tomorrow Rossella, my landlady, arrived this morning too I owe her four or five months in back rent That's a lot! I'm really counting on this thing with Peppe We should be collecting a nice bunch of cash Ulisse... it's me, Rossella That's nice. You recognized me In flesh and blood. I want to see you I have to speak to you. It's important Very different. It's a project on life I'd like to, but I'm leaving You called just as I was leaving We have an exhibition in Terracina I'll be back in a few weeks, we can meet at the theatre then Alright, I'll call in a few weeks then 'Bye Rossella, see you then I'd like to speak to David I see. He's not there? I'm his friend Rossella Who? No, Tronchi is the owner here Simone? I came back... How are you? - Where are you? - I'm very close by Here? Near the studio? Where... where are you coming from? Where were you? On the moon... Just what we needed, you on the moon too! I'll be there in ten minutes No, come tomorrow... I'm busy, I'm working now I'm two steps away from you Make it four in the other direction. See you tomorrow Rome is a big place, you can't come here, alright? Why do you piss me off so much? I'll see you tomorrow In the evening, when the Botanical Garden is closed I see... You understand... Take care, goodbye It doesn't hold the line here - Come out - I don't know how to do it Go hold it open Keep going How many are there? Three! - I can't see you from here - Keep going, I'm here Where? What are you doing over there? Come here No, you have to hold it open from the other side - Here! - It's full of wires... This is Rossella... she owns this house - She's come to Rome for a few days - My hands are dirty She's working. She's come to Rome to see some, what can I say... and so on She said she's leaving, she's going on a trip - A trip? - I don't know - Where? - I don't know - It's too liquid - It's too liquid No, it's true It's not solid. It's not a real thing. It's a shadow Is it a shadow? I'll take you for ice cream. Would you like that? Can you see all these lights? I thought I saw a shadow - What shadow? - It was behind you - I'm the invisible little girl! - Wait... go on. And now I'll get you Come here, I got you all dirty No, you didn't get me dirty... Yes, I'm all dirty! Monica, I asked you to be quiet Your mother-in-law is here. She wants the baby - Is she downstairs? - She called from there When did you do this? Let me see You're just fine. Come on Sorry we're late, I was finishing some work As usual. What is it? She was fine until two minutes ago - Simone? - Who is this? It's Rossella - Did you want to come by? - Yes Bring me some cigarettes - Do you have money with you? - Yes I'll see you soon. 'Bye What's the rush? No problem! I'm only twenty minutes late I have to go to Capannelle, we have to pick up Rosellina Go on, go even slower Come on, Monica, stop pushing me I'm late I came for... so I wouldn't die There's always time to die... and then what? I came to be reborn. I'm not able to do it Say the truth, it's useless to play around with words Why do you think I came, because I love you - I see, but what else? - I also came to understand how much distance or how much closeness there is and if their meeting points are still similar You always speak of the same things, distance and closeness We have to be more concrete This thing has filled our heads with chatter Tell me what you want or you'll piss me off How is it possible, you're the only person who pisses me off! I'd like to do some theatre. Together - You want to do theatre - Not sadistic theatre What are you talking about? What kind of play is there, a text you could still do The text would be... reality. That's the only one to do But this reality is escaping us from everywhere We don't know which part to grab it from, as if to say... we miss it... that extra spark of fantasy That thing... a transverseness... That's all words and they're old, used and re-used. Transversal... sure Ester, it's Monica. Can you send Rosellina downstairs? She's not ready yet I told you I have to take her some place, it's after 6, I'm already late... Come upstairs, I have to speak to you Let me in Wait, Salvatore is coming up too Who gave you that dress? Is it new? Did you give it to her? I have to talk to you, come here We're in a hurry. Tell me what it is - Where are you going? - I have things to do 5 minutes, for a coffee It's already 6:30, I told you I'd come for her at 6 It's 6:30. Excuse me, Salvatore... You were supposed to take her home - I don't understand. - You never understand what I say You're never clear. Tell me what you mean I know you stay out late, you take the baby with you Did you hire a private investigator? Who told you I stay out late every night? I don't understand why you question everything I do That's enough! You just have to pull that down You just pull down his pants, okay? I know what kind of work you do And I don't like the baby staying out until 2 a.m. She's always with adults, she has no playmates She has lots of friends, she's not a lonely kid! I think a mother knows what to do better than a grandmother I don't like you telling me what to do with Rosellina You're her grandmother, not her mother. I try to be nice to you I'm not rich and the fact that I have to work - means that I... - No, wait... I try to be nice, but you criticize everything I do Her hair isn't cut, you don't like her clothes I earn an honest living. Let's get out of here before... You know what I think And you know what I think. We're different, that's all I agree, but we're talking about my granddaughter She's my daughter, why do you say she's uncared for? You just say she's your daughter You're not capable of raising a daughter, understand? - What? - You're unable to raise her That's enough, I'm sick of this You're incapable of being a mother I'm going to talk to Paolo and get a lawyer involved I'll do my best to take her away from you. I don't like it You absolutely can't do what you're saying and I'm not interested in what you like or not! Are you the one to decide if I can be a mother? Who the fuck are you? I'm going to talk to my son, because you can't... Good, talk to him, it's about time! You're getting like an old man. I'm bored I'm 20 years old. I need to live, to go out go to the movies, to the theatre without the stress of you on top of me You want to keep me here in this disgusting place! I don't like it. I want to live like a young person I'm not looking for another guy I want to live. Is that so hard? Don't you think... - Daniel, I need two minutes... - Let me work! Be nice, you gave us five minutes We'll finish the girl first, and then... I have to finish something first - Should I continue? - Yes Daniel has to leave for five minutes, right? No, I have to set these lights - Let us finish with her - You can't now - But I told you... - Very good I want to give you some advice, it may help you The way you stand is important you either stay still... or you move Something of a rhythm can be of help to you It's the way in which you stand still or the way that you move that has importance More... more importance - Are you an actress? - Yes Excuse me, Daniel, can we have 5 minutes? - Who is she? - I don't know It's a look towards... like looking ahead - Ahead in what sense? - In a distance, as if there were a horizon. Don't look at the audience, only in some moments... Straight ahead, in the distance Pardon? More... It's the sense of importance you can have when you're still and to look in the distance, not at the audience as if there were a horizon before you - What is she saying to her? - I don't know To look ahead, far in the distance I don't know who she is - Can I help... - No, I was looking for... - Tell me - I was looking for Ulisse We're all looking for him. We never know if he'll come - Would you mind if I looked around? - No, don't worry Sorry, Camilla. There's always a bit of chaos here ...Nobody. The farmers are too rough and monotonous And the intellectuals are difficult to understand As far as our friends They are mean and never see beyond their own noses - They're stupid - What part is this? It's Astrud's monologue from "Uncle Vanya" That's beautiful - They have no emotions... - It's not easy - That depends... - When does the play open? I have to do the audition now - A bit higher - Raise it a bit We'll try this right now Is there any of that left? May I have a small one? I'm going to sit down You can imagine how strange it was I already knew Monica, I'd seen her before She lived in my neighbourhood in Naples - Was she pretty? - She was attractive She wasn't really beautiful She's prettier now, she used to be particular because she wasn't like anyone else People would get off the train and then she'd walk by She was fourteen years old and had long braids She walked like a dancer, I was sure she was a dancer Then by chance I met her in Rome 10 years later through some Neapolitan friends, here in Rome, - She was looking for work - When was her daughter born? The baby had already been born when I met her She was already two or three years old - Have you ever slept with her? - Not really... Yes, we have something platonic but we can't seem to have anything concrete... Help her if you can Anything you can give her is worth it Monica can lift herself with your help Otherwise, she'll be overwhelmed A little bit of help can make people become important She's sweet. She's not negative It's like throwing a ball over a wall of silence You can feel help when the ball is given to you It makes you feel reborn, you find yourself again That is what life is I've always wondered what's behind the counter? Behind the counter? - It's prettier out front - Are you sure? Will that be all? It's as good as you are, as warm as my heart Come on! That's my secret, okay? Do you have a piece of paper? You deserve to be reported for excessive beauty! - Is everyone so nice in Formia? - Aren't they nice in Rome? - They're nice - Nobody's a fool here - You're from Naples? - Yes Did you drink your tequila? Did you drink your tequila? What's all the talk? This place is a lousy environment - Why? - Your mother-in-law is right You're working, right? You get too friendly with people You don't even know what's happening What's wrong with you? What was wrong with them? I feel strange, you're right You are strange, what's the matter? I mean, this is my job, right? What should I be doing? If he asks for a tequila, should I not give it to him? Rosellina is fast asleep Let's go to sleep too. Goodnight - Goodnight - Bye, take care Do you want? Let's go Do you want to see? You want me naked? I'm not crazy! I was joking! Fuck off! Hey guys! I want to see people! Do you understand? What do you want, to live or die? Can't you hear me? - What is it? - I made something Is everything ready? Call Monica tell her to come here Monica, do you want to eat? Something really stinks. That must be cheese - It stinks, get it out of here - What are you looking at me for? - Don't you like this? - I don't like shrimps - They're delicious! - I'm vegetarian - Are they raw? - Taste them - I can't - They're no good - You put something on them - Lemon No, there's some kind of strange oil on them - There's no oil - There's only lemon The oil is over there if you want some - That stuff makes me sick - You're too fixated on this It's not bad for you I take this sort of thing as a provocation - Really? - I take it as provocation You make lunch out of this crap? Basil leaves like this? You put this on a table? - You can put it over there - A joke is one thing. But this... is really disgusting! Those shrimp can make you sick! They're all mushy! Shrimp is a choice dish! Come on, she likes them Shrimp isn't made like that! Never! What do you care how they're made, you never eat shrimp - Why are you making a fuss? - Don't start with me Shrimp shouldn't be drowned and thrown on a dish You make them with pasta, or fried or baked Even if they're no good, they should be presented well! I didn't know what you'd like, and I made them this way... You don't give raw stuff to normal people! You give people some pasta, not raw stuff like that! I'm afraid to use the stove I'm going to get some water It's not her fault, she did everything... You went too far, she's really embarrassed I know, I'm being infantile, you know... What are you doing? Did you buy potato chips? Help! - Can we fit? - Of course How nice to see you! What, are you leaving? - Is there one of those meetings going on? - Yes, they're always so enjoyable Rossella, how nice to see you, it's been so long Where are you going? This is wonderful, you'll like it, you'll see The only way to respond to the administration is to show them we're not totally against the foreigners We are respectful of the law, a law which mistreats our businesspeople, our citizens, everyone so why should they be able to evade that? We're now losing one of the biggest businesses in the area And that will signify that seven families will be reduced to poverty They won't be hired by the Chinese community which is ruining our commercial activities I'd like to say just a word I want to thank you sincerely. This meeting for the market in Piazza Vittorio is very important because the piazza is reminiscent, an essence of Rome There is one thing I'd like to say firmly If we put on these demonstrations with arrogance and violence, we will lose The arguments are right but I think we should be calmer and with a goal in mind a goal you can reach and fight for, because we must always fight They're coming to Europe because they want to live in a democratic society, a well to do society - What are you talking about? - The Chinese people I'm saying there are Romans eating out of garbage bins, is that well to do? I think that for the first time Rome has to accept this phenomenon that has been happening for about... - three or four years now - What? Maybe for you My experience says it's been sixteen years! This is a sort of breakdown of that power... of Christianity... before Constantine... No, when... The Church's material and spiritual power are divided... What year was Constantine? - 700... - 784. You're off by four centuries! You're saying things that happened four centuries later! Not four years, but four centuries! Constantine's Edict refering to the problem you mentioned was in 313, about the passage and constitution of power... Professor, we're deciding on our demonstration! We have to have a large public demonstration That's what we have to do, am I right? But it can't be that a few stray dogs show up, no! We have to bring 10,000 people into the street! - How do you get those masses? - I'll tell you how! - It's not hard to gather them - Oh yes it is! - Wait just a minute! - You push them to it! No! We just need each and everyone of you to convince ten people. Ten and ten and ten... And we'll have 10,000 people! Do you all agree? - Oh, you're here - Are you leaving already? This has to be washed Can't you see there's a mess in here? This wasn't done well, it was just passed over This should be transparent. Do you see transparence? If you want them transparent you have to get a sponge and make them transparent - Can't you do that? - No, I have to leave - Where do you have to go? - To work, it's 6 o'clock This job of yours is creating disasters You're out until 4 at night and when you get here these are the consequences. This work isn't done well What should I tell this guy when he comes tomorrow? Why didn't you do any work on it yourself? I don't understand how you can come here at the end of a day and criticize a job I've been doing since 9 a.m. I've done three of them. Where were you? You're a mature person, take care of yourself I am mature and that's why I asked where you were I've been here since this morning while you took a walk Generally in life, if you want something done well you have to give it a minimum of care But seeing as you don't care for things you want... Just once in your life, can't you take on responsibility? I have to take on responsibility? We've worked hard, don't you want it to turn out well? Or do I have to stay here and sacrifice? Sacrifice? You go out walking and that's a sacrifice? I have two jobs and that's no sacrifice Are you a baby that can't understand these things? Is my relationship to you as an adult or as a baby? You don't seem very adult, right now you're an asshole! Should I come and get you tonight or not? No, thank you Don't worry about it, this job is secondary! It's secondary to you, Salvatore I have a nice surprise for you I don't know about this... That's no good, you're half naked Put on a normal dress, that's not a dress - I'll wear the black one - That one is pretty - Will there be a lot of people? - No, not many This one? Yes, wear that, it's perfect for tonight Maybe this one. I don't know what to wear It's not a formal evening It's Giancarlino's party, he's doing a show on the 5th floor Just put anything on, don't get so obsessive Just put anything on and we'll go Is this alright? I told you it's fine, this isn't such a big deal Just wear anything you want I'm doing something important now I have to turn in this work tomorrow I can't think about such silliness Salvatore, should I wear make-up? - Yes, you look good in make-up - Alright, I'll wear some ...They'll all be out here standing still on the terrace I'll tell you when to take a break and when to sing I'll say who should be singing. I'll be the orchestra conductor Play a nice low toned, soft backround for example Theatre bores me, it's like life It's not that you have to throw yourself from the 5th floor But you have to live life! Therefore you have to live theatre which means life! Shakespeare taught us this, so that means to die! So if someone does theatre he must die! It's late... I thought I'd impress you, I guess not... Sure you did, it was really negative The doorbell is ringing. There are people at the door Hey Beppe, how are you? I'm fine. You look good, very sexy. This is Alex Do you see what a masterpiece I've done? It's beautiful, I like it a very much Look at the beautiful Earth I've done for you God didn't make it this perfect, look at that I like it. Are you sure it rotates? Of course! It's just right for the dancers to lie on top - Lie on top? - It will be spectacular Let's take it down. Will you give me a hand? Listen, don't you want to see the other planets? Here... what is this? This... you can't see that from the stage What does that mean? This isn't finished! - I have to finish that part - Finish? You're overreacting, what's the matter? - I said you can't see that, right Alex? - No, of course you can see it Right, Alex. What do you mean I'm overreacting? You were supposed to finish three months ago I came today to pick it up, I have a show tonight. - Look! Where's the rest? - The planets? Are they finished at least? I have to tell you I think you're overreacting What overreaction? - I worked on this for two months - Look at this crap you've done for me Look at the earth, you did half desert and half water - Who could do a planet like that for you? - Okay, that's not so bad an effect Let me see if it's transparent Go behind with this handkerchief for a second Let me if we can see your hand behind there - You're being obsessive - Obsessive! It was your job! Let's see that hand - No, you can't see anything - No, not like that... - That's just great! - Were you supposed to see? Yes. Salvatore knew that too Then he says the dancers have to interact with it Salvatore, what should we do? That has to be finished This one, Alex was right when he said you can see the brushstrokes, it's a mess The globe is half sea and half desert, right? Didn't you have a globe, even something a kid would use? Salvatore, look at me What happened? What's wrong with him? - With who? - Salvatore I'll make it all sea up here on the top now - That will make him happy! - Should I make some coffee? No, stay there. Talk to him, keep him calm If he wants some coffee, make him some I'll make it all ocean - It's hot - It's very hot today There's a strange sensation of... sand in your throat, sometimes this air is... - It's hot - Mostly at this time of day. The air is sticky You can't breathe Careful, hold it tight, don't crush it now! Lift it... Let it down slowly Don't bump it It makes a strange sound Move so we can get it through It won't pass Move it back - And now? - Take down the door Now... we'll get it through You're bringing really negative energy here - I thought you took the measurements well - You took the measurements Me, personally? What was I thinking when I gave him this show We're murdering this globe, does that seem normal to you? Push it slowly! It has to get out Don't treat the earth that way! - Wait - What are we waiting for? Can I tell you something? I made that world... Push! My hands are full of paint Be careful, it will roll away! Gently! Go gently! I don't understand, what did you say? What did she say? I didn't understand her Salvatore, excuse me Come on, nothing will happen! - How much does he owe you? - A couple of million lire Aren't you going to ask for it? They're leaving What money, it's all broken I gave you an advance, the work is crap and the world broke! You paid small change! Aren't you paying for the others? If the artist can't measure, it's not our fault! You're taking everything and not paying? - Keep your hands off! - You keep your hands off! You owe us two million lire! Two million lire! This world is a mess! You took two months to build this crap! But we worked for two months on this! You're taking it and won't pay? - Won't you say anything? - Money for what? Do this yourself, who the fuck are you? I don't want to give you this earth, it's mine! Fuck you! Don't let me see you anymore, I'll make you see real Martians Go! Go do your shows! Star Wars! Hey, is that yours? - Why? - Are you selling it? This is an artwork, it's going to a gallery Are you selling it or not? Will you sell it? - I might - How much do you want? 3 million lire, minimum Do you have cash on you, how do you want to buy it? How you have your money, in briks? - No, I've already had enough trouble - We'll go to my bank, I'll give it to you today But you have to deliver it 3 million, but delivered this morning Let's do it. Let's go to my bank and I'll pay you for it Excuse me, sir We have to unload our stuff - We'll just unload this first - Look, it's almost here Yes, but just a second... You're acting like you own the street! Be quiet, I'm talking to him! Calm down, I'll take care of this Just a minute, move over! Yes, we're taking it down You could help us, thanks - My truck is here - Who are you pushing! He's acting like he owns the street! The car cannot stay here What happened? We got into a mess with the Chinese, people got hit Listen, is there anyone near the car? Is there anyone near the car? Excuse me, why can't you go there? The Chinese are there It's full of Chinese. Bring the car here! - Why are you there? - Stop asking questions! Get the fucking car! You know what? Let's all go to the beach I have a friend who owns a beach establishment Let's leave this earth, it's getting heavy Aren't you going to sell it? If he comes for it and pays... If not, I'll give it to him - You'll give it to him? - What can we do with this Earth? It's carrying negative energy anyway We worked on it for two months! - What do you care! - What do I care? I need the money, Salvatore My job at the bar isn't all that much help Did you think you'd get rich from this set building? No, but I thought two months work would bring some money You shouldn't think such petty things You're too... Look, money will show up When? I'm not... I want to know when I'll get some money Don't worry, money will show up somehow Do we want to do something? You can't do anything here anymore. Damn It's too much, I'll try to read it - A piano plays in the... - Why do you talk like that? Speak up! - Sorry - You need more grit You have to grab the words The sound, you have to grip it A piano plays during a pause in the meal... the silence of the sleepy street is covered in B flat Come on, be pissed off! ...like a scaled fish. The appearance is brown with swollen bronchials, breathing putrid August air Open your mouth! In the burning cavern of the throat A broken piece of coolness, the green so beautiful - Turns... oh fuck! - Come on, keep going! You can't read anymore, where have you been? Did you take a trip around the world? To do what? To unlearn the little that you knew before Statues. Augusto, Traiano and other things... Let me understand what you're saying. I can't understand - White on white - White on white White on white Just as Casimir in the ruins, used to dream What is the advantage of all this work to man? Where he toiled beneath the sun? Answer me! - Wait - Use your voice! Come on! - Choose another piece! - I, the most mortal passer-by Skip the words, go from one verse to the next And so we slept, hugging a Leica to imprint dreams on the lens and recognize ourselves in a photograph awakening with a longer life Where are the Mecs beach houses? No? Nobody knows them I don't know exactly. Go to the corner go straight and ask up ahead near the sea Excuse me, Mecs beach houses? - Mecs Village - You have to turn back - Excuse me! - Young man! - Where is Mecs? - What? - Mecs, Mecs beach club - Mecs beach establishment - Mecs, let me see... - You have to take a V position with your hand on the aluminium bar I understand, it burns damn it! Wet it with those... Wet my face I don't feel well I feel bad inside here! Mecs, the establishment in Torvajanica Mecs, is down... Go to the end of the road and then turn left Then you go... ls it a place where they do a lot of music? Music, young people dancing... It's a modern place Have you asked anywhere else? They know them all down there You just have to ask for it and they'll know it Why is that thing on your car? Just forget about it I do fashion shots too, I do these things I'd like to photograph with the world, this one for example It's sewn shut! Corrado! You piece of shit! Open this fucking thing! It's boiling in here! You were saying, it's a perturbance... - That's to say... - The greenhouse effect The greenhouse effect Why? I remember until a few years back, it was better By August there was a breeze - She's pretty - She's a really complex person That girl has nice skin, doesn't she? She's very complex, you have no idea how much Instead of a head, she has problems There is a feeling between us in the end There's something that binds us but you know how these moody people are She's one way in the morning and another in the afternoon In the evening... She doesn't express her sexuality Do you see the problem? She doesn't express sexuality Every night A different woman every day Sure, but it's awful. In the day you say, not today... But then you see them dancing at night You smell this perfume of sensuality... And then I hate myself in the morning So don't worry about this sexuality thing I'm probably in worse shape than you But how do you do it, get a girl every night... You maybe do it with two, three... But I feel empty inside, Salvatore You don't appreciate the privilege you have You're crying tears over your good luck Look at what I've become. I used to be a stud When I went dancing at the clubs, I was some kind of guy This set design I'm doing now, who made me do it? I was a lawyer, I lived like a gentleman Then I threw myself into this fucking art world Why the fuck didn't I come to the beach before? I was tormented in that fucking city Are you always in town? Fool! I was born by the sea, we come from the water I'm realizing all of that now! See you later! What's the matter? - What's wrong? - Please, call a doctor Stay calm, don't move Hold her head Do you have any metabolic disease? Diabetes? Has she taken anything? We were dancing a little Maybe we got too hot in the sun - I'm better - Feeling better already? - Go slowly, Rossella! - Stay down a little more - Where are you going later? - That depends on you I have no idea Wait a minute You're leaving soon, what are you doing later? I don't know, we came to get you... If I stay late, will you take Rosellina? Why, what do you have to do? I just think I'll be late, do you understand? I don't want her staying here until two in the morning In case she gets sleepy, you know... You told me to come for you, why are you staying? I said to come see me, now I'm asking you to take her home - Why are you staying here? - I have to finish work! Did you find another American gigolo? Me? I'm working You're demented! What an asshole Why did you come here, to bust balls or what? Let's put on your shoes Put the shoes on! You can't go with no shoes Put on your shoes Let me see those feet - Rossella! Ciao, how are you? - And you? I'm okay I guess Who's this? Is she your daughter? She's so pretty! God, she's wonderful! She's prettier than you! - Much prettier than me - Even prettier than me! You're looking well You're not doing so well. It's better that way What can you do when you're doing well? There's no goalie, no penalty! There's only tension of waiting for a penalty when you're ill When you're feeling good, it's not there - That's not good - Not being ill doesn't mean that you're well, it just not being ill It's not being ill - That's a difficult reality - I haven't seen you for a long time - I'm seeing you now - What are you up to? - I'm very chaste - Very... Casta Diva? Can I tell you something? Me... how do I seem to you? You have beautiful eyes No, stop kidding around! - You have beautiful eyes! - Come on! - What's making you sad? - It's not confessable All my sadnesses are very confessable But I don't feel like it! Have you ever taken a tram in your life? Always! The number 30 tram... It can save your life! If you don't like the 30, the number 31 is fantastic! Better than psychoanalysis! Dear Rossella... You're still a curly haired girl What's the matter? She said she'd be back in about an hour and a half Monica? Are you waiting for her? Go to sleep, don't worry Aren't you sleepy? You haven't slept at all I called the police because he feels sick We did artificial respiration, but he's not responding Didn't he say he wasn't feeling well? Did he have any symptoms before... Well? Miss, try to remember if he took anything Any medicine, any narcotics at all, the situation is very serious I don't remember Do you know if he has cardiac problems, diabetes? God! I don't know He looked just fine and then he suddenly turned all white He scared me because he wasn't able to speak, but... That's when you called us? Then I called you and I called him too, but... So about twenty minutes had passed since he'd felt ill I don't know. Twenty minutes, half an hour He never answered me That's why I'm telling you the situation isn't... You said it's serious, but you won't say what's wrong We drank, that's not so strange after someone works all day I'm coming. Excuse me, I'll be right back What happened to him? What's happening? Wait, stay in here No, I want to go see what's going on, wait
