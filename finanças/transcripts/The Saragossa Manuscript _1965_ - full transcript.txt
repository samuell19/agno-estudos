ZRF "Kamera" presents a movie based on a novel by Jan Potocki. THE SARAGOSSA MANUSCRIPT Screenplay: Starring: Music: Cinematography: Directed by: We're being surrounded! Fire! Fire! Attack! Follow me! Wait! Follow... You're my prisoner. Do not resist. Hey! Can you hear me? I'll be right with you. I'll just finish looking through these fine prints. Forgot about the enemy? Continue the pursuit. That's interesting. Very. I wish I knew Spanish. That's about my grandfather. Count Olavidez, who had not yet brought settlers to the Sierra... Captain! Captain! We're being surrounded. What do we do? Close the door! It's drafty in here! Where was I? Here. To the Sierra Morena mountains. That steep mountain range dividing Andalusia from La Mancha was then a refuge of highwaymen and Gyp... Merci, Gypsies who allegedly feasted on the bodies of murdered travelers. - Will we make it before nightfall? - Before nightfall? Three days is not enough to cross those mountains. What about the lodgings? The night falls early. Even if we find an inn, it will be deserted. For the ghosts force the owners out and once a ghost gets attached to a place... Then what? Then it's better to keep quiet about it. Once you wander here you should prepare for the worst. Your ghosts don't scare me. I can deal with them. Senor, listen to Mosquito. Saddle the mules and follow me. And make haste! Do not go any further, Senor, invisible hands of demons push people down the abyss. They have hooves instead of feet. - Let us go towards Estremadura. - The views are nicer there. We shall go straight ahead and stop here by the oaks where we shall eat our provisions. Then, we shall spend the night at Venta Quemada, where we shall stock up on food and prepare to cross the mountains. And after three more days, tired but happy from achieving our goal we shall triumphantly enter Castille. Nothing will change that plan. He will be the end of us. If the King Don Philip V graced me with the rank of a captain of the Walloon Guard, it lies upon my honor to find the shortest way to Madrid. Young Senor, the king might have graced you with your rank but reason did not grace your head with its presence. I'm thirsty. - It's unwise to drink water after eating fruits. - Where is the muleteer? - I don't like this. - Senor... He ran away with provisions. Do not say that, Senor! Evil spirits abducted poor Mosquito! He ran away! He ran away! Damn bastard! I never liked his cunning eyes! Oh, why didn't I listen to brother Hieronymus de la Trinidad, the holy monk and preacher? He always said that officers of the Walloon Guard were heretics. Shut up, you fool! I will catch him and break his bones, if it turns out that he chickened out. By Saint Aparisot, do not leave me alone in this place, Senor. - Then you go! - No, sir. I will not. We're not done talking! Mosquito! He ran away. Two foreign ladies who are guests at this inn invite you to dinner. Kindly follow me, Senor. Noble Senor, thank you for gracing this modest feast with your presence. Satisfy your hunger, nobelSefi0L You probably haven't eaten since this morning. Our meeting surprises you? My name is Emina. This is my sister, Zibelda. We live in Tunis but come from Grenada where our relatives still secretly profess the faith of our fathers. Our journey is a secret of great importance which we want to entrust to your honesty. We expected that, noble Senor. I sat by your side to tell you the story of our family. Listen carefully. Do you carry a lover's portrait inside this locket? It's a gift from my mother containing a piece of a true relict. That scares you? Only evil spirits fear holy relics. Be not surprised with my sister, we are Muslims. It saddens us that our closest relative professes a strange fate. I'm your relative? Me? Your mother is a Gomelez. Just like we are. Never heard of it! Might you be mistaken, dear ladies? No. I promised to tell you the story of our ancestors, but I should probably start with my own. Sit here. We've been waiting for you. If fear made you choose another route, we would have lost any respect we have for you. You flatter me. But I never deviate from the chosen direction. And my courage concerns you how? - You concern us. - Me? You may be less flattered when you find out that we've never encountered a man before. My sister tells the truth. We had no brothers and, having spent our lives in a seraglio we had no idea about your sex. Nature, however, graced us with an inclination to love and so we fell for each other. This is getting interesting. We love each other deeply. Seeing that, our mother promised us that we would either remain virgins or be married to the same man. Her promise reassured us a little. The head of the family agreed to our marrying one man providing that he is a Gomelez. - And that's me? - Yes. We found that thought most attractive. But my religion, the holy dogmas of my faith... - Don't you like us, Alphonse? - But I do... We're not nice enough? Oh, but you are. You are. It's almost dawn. The hours are too dear to be wasted on empty words. We cannot become your wives unless... ...you accept the law of the Prophet. But you'll be allowed to see us in your dreams. Providing you keep our existence secret. Do you agree? Pass me the goblet. Remember your promise. Oh, dear cousin... Why can't you be Muslim? How happy would I be if seeing you... ...on Emma's bosom... I could also call myself your wife. Follow me, my son. Woe betide him who in his pernicious obduracy refuses to confess his faults. Do not spend the night outside. And beware of all temptations for God raised his right hand. I'll obey you, father, but first of all my stomach demands some food. Think how to save your soul and leave your bodily needs to me. Strange things were happening last night. Did you stay at the abandoned inn? I was in Venta Quemada but I have my reasons not to talk about it. Satan tempts us all the time. Beware of his hubris, my son. Oh, yes... Beware of Satan. Your courage surprises me. Who are you, young man? Who brought you UP? Do you believe in ghosts? Not at all. Don't threat, he's a madman that I'm trying to exorcise. Pacheco, Pacheco. In the name of Our Lord I order you to take the goats to the mountain. Behold the example of Satan's reign over this wretched land. I spare him no time in hope that he'll be saved. He's been making great progress recently. - Does he milk those goats? - He does. Appease my curiosity, my son. I asked about your life. You honor me, Father, so I'll tell you everything. My family had more illustrious men than money. My father, a colonel of the Walloon Guard, was an extremely gentle and truly honorable nobleman. As I am van Worden! You'll pay for this, you rascal! A horse! Get me a horse! What are you waiting for, cowards?! This will end badly. Senor, would you kindly spare me a moment. - Take a seat. - In private. Senor, I do not have the pleasure of your acquaintance. You shall have one in a moment, Senor. Senor... After you. After you. Your carriage, Senor, overtook mine. There's something insulting about that and I'd like, Senor, to hear your excuse. Senor, I believe it wasn't my carriage that overtook yours, but yours was so slow that it was left behind. I admit you're right. It's a shame, however, that you failed to observe that before I drew my sword. Senor, I understand you perfectly. Forgive me, Senor, for taking up your time. Don't mention it. - May I? - Of course, Senor. Do excuse me, Senor, but the meat might still be warm. Water... Why did he order his carriage to be chopped up? He would be much more comfortable now. Once it was overtaken, he couldn't stand to look at it. - Water... - I would have sold it. Such a lord never sells, only destroys. All my fortune... All my fortune for a sip of water... Hear that? You'd be rich if you had water. He's gone crazy with these duels. When your master likes to collect wounds you have to be prepared for everything. Damn it! I would damn my soul for a drop of water. I invited you, Senors, to my wedding. All of you with whom I had the pleasure of crossing my sword and whom I did not kill. You've come to celebrate with me, now proffer me some advice. In this letter, the Mayor of Boullon urges me to come at once to take over my ancestors' castle in the Ardennes. Should I then abandon my service to the King, or leave the inheritance to its own devices? Take a vote. And I shall follow your advice. Kindly hurry up, Senors, or the meat will get cold. Farewell to my King and master, farewell to sunny Spain. And you are all invited to a feast at my new castle. ' Let's - Who s gOing to pay? It's a loss! I'll go bankrupt. Away, away, away! For Senorita! Follow me! Follow the newlyweds! There is no place like our sunny Spain. Olé! It was a stupid idea. Never again will I sing a serenade for the most beautiful Senorita. - Be quiet! - You're right. It's not the same. I do not envy the newlyweds. Long live the newlyweds! I wish your son a speedy return to Spain. My lady, our son shall be called Alphonse. Senors, feast and celebrate. As a true Spaniard, I must fulfill my duties to the end. To the end! To the end! My lady, this rain brings to mind the siege of Lerida, when I spent three weeks up to my waist in water. Those were the days. I was famous for my courage back then. And exactly nine months later, I came into this world. You've told it beautifully, my son. It's obvious that your father is a man of honor. Did you inherit this virtue from him? Officers of the Walloon Guard do not brag, father. Before you move on to your own story, I'll call Pacheco to bring you fresh milk. I'd rather tell you right away. Being brought up away from my family home was to prepare me for the life of a nobleman. She took out a golden key... The lid sprung open and a skeleton jumped out. I drew my sword but the skeleton ripped out its left arm and, using it as a weapon, attacked me fiercely. I defended myself bravely when another skeleton appeared. It ripped off the rib of the first one and hit me on the head with all its might. Welcome, my son. So many years... So many years... My dear boy. You haven't forgotten God's alphabet, have you, my son? Or my teachings? I have not. I've learned diligently, master. Show us, son. Show us. Perfect. Perfect. My dear Urraca, leave to men what is manly. The time has come, my son, for me to show you the unfailing thrust. It's extremely difficult but once you've mastered its secret you will become the best among swordsmen. En garde! Dear Urraca, I have fought one hundred and thirty... Yes, one hundred and thirty duels. It's time to share my experience. Allez! - I failed. Again. - You were the best among swordsmen. You can console yourself that Alphonse will proudly take your place. Go to the fatherland, son. Spain is the most wonderful country in the world. I will do my best to make you a captain of the Walloon Guard. So I came to this part of the world and last night... Dear son, your story is very engaging. I see that you received a thorough education. But since you spent last night at Venta Quemada... What was I saying? Oh yes... I'm afraid you might have been haunted by two hanged men. I wouldn't want you to suffer the faith of poor Pacheco. I am not afraid, my father. My mother warned me you could once encounter madmen here, but not anymore. You haven't seen the terrifying form of a madman whose eye was plucked out by devils? Pacheco! His story may be the way to save your soul. I will order him to begin. Pacheco, Pacheco. In the name of Our Lord I order you to tell your story to our kind guest. I was born in Cordova, where my father led a wealthy life. You can skip that part, Pacheco. His mother died three years ago and his father decided to marry a certain young widow. Camilla de Tormes. After the wedding in Seville my father returned home with his wife and her sister, lnezilla. My dearest wife, my lady, I've bought mules for your carriage. And for you, beautiful lnezilla, a sapphire ring. You are the best husband, my lord, and brother-in-law. Inezilla is overjoyed. Aren't you, lnezilla? Thank you with all my heart. Don't eat fruit, lnezilla. You know it's not good for you. I'm glad you're both happy. Camilla, as usual after dinner, we would like to hear your song. Oh yes, sing for us, Camilla. Come with me, sister. We'll fetch the instruments. I beg you, father. Let me marry beautiful lnezilla. We'll move to Madrid and start a wonderful life there. Don't even think of it, son. Firstly, it is not fitting for a son to be his father's brother-in-law. Secondly, church laws forbid such unions. I love her, father. More than life. And thirdly, I don't want you to marry lnezilla. Don't worry, Pacheco. Don't worry. If your father won't let you marry my sister there is nothing stopping you from becoming her lover. My lady, lnezilla is an angel of chastity. How could l...? Leave that to me, Pacheco. My sister will listen to my plea uttered with pain in my heart. Pacheco, Pacheco... Who can resist you? Cut it short, Pacheco. Get to the part where your father left for Madrid taking his wife and her sister. The days without lnezilla were unbearable. I missed her and I suffered. Manuela! - Venta Quemada? - You are to wait there, Senor. The Sierra Mountains are infested with bands of robbers. It's much calmer there since two of the cruellest bandits were hanged - -the Zoto brothers. - Is lnezilla accompanying my father? - She is, Senor. No sense in lingering, then. Inezilla... We shall never part again. Can we wine and dine here? And spend the night? In the name of Saint Parasitus, do not do it, Senor. You don't have clean sheets? I have enough to host a royal court, Senor. - So? - Ghosts wander here at night. Ghosts... Even we spend nights in a nearby village. It's horrible here at night. My friend, we'll sleep with ghosts. If this is your will, Senor... But allow me and my wife to leave the inn for the night. I'll make sure ghosts don't steal anything. Where do you think you're going? I'm afraid to play with the ghosts, Senor. So get out with them, you fool. Pacheco, it's time. Your father is asleep and lnezilla is waiting for you. Come. Come, come. Everything is going well. Just look. - It really does. - I'll let you know when it's time. Pacheco, Pacheco! We're waiting for you. Inezilla, do you really desire a lover? You two will be lovers but I'll never leave you. Kiss her. İntensely. You love lnezilla and I love you. She will refuse you nothing but you must remember my terms. What do you think, my son? I think you'd be afraid in such circumstances. A nobleman fears nothing. If so, let Pacheco continue with the story. Maybe I'll hear some interesting details. Pacheco, Pacheco! In the name of Our Lord I order you to go on. Half dead, I escaped from the gallows and I wandered in the wilderness all day. I know what you want to say. Had I been here earlier a great feast would await me but now... Exactly. Ghosts wander here at night. And you spend every night in a nearby village. Then allow me, Senor, to leave you alone now. Were a nobleman from Cordova and two ladies staying here last night? Try to remember, a nobleman from Cordova. Your dinner is on the stove, Senor. On the stove... Let us sit by you. Pacheco... we're so cold... Pacheco, let us hug you... Leave me alone, Satan! You chase us away? Come, sister. Let's start the fire. What say you, my son? I see you're convinced of Satan's power. It's late. I won't offer you a place here. Pacheco's screams would keep you awake. Go to the chapel. - The chapel? - The chapel. But there I will hear his screams as well. - They are terrifying. - Son, I know what I'm saying. To the chapel, then. A peaceful sleep awaits you there. Kneel at the altar, confess your sins, do your penance. - The evil can still be averted. - I don't remember committing any sins. Unless in my sleep. - Who's here? - We're cold. It's us. Your lovers. Go back to your gallows. I want to sleep. You mock us, for you're in a chapel. - Come to us to the cemetery. - I'm at your service. But tomorrow. I can see you are quite jumpy, my son. Not that I'm surprised. Dark forces of hell were frolicking here last night. Goats were bleating. Devils like to take different forms, my son. Somehow they don't touch me, father. I can see you still have hope. Though I'm not certain it can last. It can. I do not wish to detain you any longer before your journey. In two days you will have crossed the Sierra Morena. You will find provisions fastened to your saddle. Tell me, father. Which is the shortest way to Madrid? I've never been to Madrid, my son. I do know, however, that the way leads over... there. Thank you, father. Remember, my son, God has raised his right hand. - Senor Alphonse van Worden? - Yes, the captain of the Walloon Guard. In that case I arrest you in the name of the Holy Inquisition. Surrender your sword, Senor. Senors! Gentlemen! I'm a nobleman! He's an extremely noisy sinner, my lord. Hopefully, he's as talkative when he faces the Holy Tribunal. Amen. Our system dictates that the culprit should accuse himself. Such a confession, though a little forced, has its good sides. Especially, if the culprit kindly names his accomplices. Do you know two African princesses? Your silence can only worsen your situation. I see I'll have to lead you to the righteous path. Let us then begin the first trial. Soon, you'll faint. But salt and spirit will bring you round. Let us then begin the second trial. - Alphonse, Alphonse! - What? Where? You are saved, Alphonse. Senor Zoto comes to your rescue. - My darling Alphonse. - Alphonse. Dear cousin, you have shown extraordinary courage. No time for kisses. We must be far away before the guards arrive. This is Senor Zoto. Senor Alphonse, it's an honor to introduce my brothers: Chico... Mono and Chico. How can that be, Zeke'? '(our brewers were hanged! You heard well, Senor. But as you can see they're both healthy and strong. I saw it with my own eyes! You saw two shepherds hanged to put the locals at ease. I am very happy... Don't mention it. We have our horses to thank. I'm glad you came to. And may luck never leave you, Senor. We are being surrounded! Chico, cover our retreat! To horses everyone! Where is my sword?! Watch it. Carefully. Beware you all! Strike harder. Kiss me. Now me. Oh, how happy I am. Are you glad to see us, cousin? Cousin, thatjewel disgusts us. And it prevents us from loving you deeply. Are you happy, cousin? I am. Though I have to admit that the night we spent together did not end quite so pleasantly. Blame us for the pleasures. It wasn't as pleasant in the morning. Let's not talk about it any more. This is a string of our hair and a talisman by which to remember us. Talisman... It's a mistake to think that you can only love one woman. I have fallen for both of you equally. My heart perceives you as one. - Take our faith. - You would take the throne in Tunis. Seraglios, gardens, fountains... Let's not talk about kingdoms under the sun. We are in the abyss bordering on hell. How dare you stay in the company of women of the Gomelez blood? - Cousin, you are lost! - Forgive us! Either you will die, disgracefully beheaded with that axe and your body will be hanged by the Zoto brothers for vultures and devils to feast upon, or... But the Zoto brothers... or you'll empty that goblet at one gulp! Father, you'd do the same for your honor. What an unpleasant misunderstanding. Evil spirits take so many forms that it's impossible to fathom. Senor here? You're too young for a cabalist. Although, you as well have a rope around your neck. Don't let it bother you. You are courageous, that much I know. But you lack experience. Your name is Alphonse. Your mother is a Gomelez and you're a captain in the Walloon Guard. Let us quickly abandon that sorry place. Then we shall think what to do next. My name is Alphonse van Worden. That's obvious. I can see, Senor, that your strength has left you. This miraculous drink should quickly set you up. No. No more miraculous drinks for me. Where are you headed, Senor? - To Madrid. - That's excellent. On our way, we can stop at a place where I've left a lavish feast. Not miraculous. Lavish. And now listen. The books of Nach-su-chani conceal the wisdom of Chaldean knowledge. While the lines of Shir-ha-shi-rim hide the purest beauty of poetry. In Hebrew every letter is a number, every word a wise combination, every sentence a terrible formula which, if pronounced with appropriate aspiration and accents, can easily move mountains and dry up rivers. You know well that Adonai created the world with a word... Last night I was a victim of a nastyjoke here. Let's go in. - My horse! Unbelievable. - And mine. - I don't understand... - A horse always follows its master. It is fortunate that devils don't need to eat. Good, isn't it? What is? Nothing, Senor. Just asking. I'm glad I can feed you. And what is that? I believe, Senor, that it belongs to you. So you spent the night at this inn. I was here but I do not intend to talk about it. A wonderful night... despite everything. - Despite what? - I also gave my word. - To whom? - To two beautiful ladies. And don't ask, Senor, about anything else. Let's get going. It's still a long way to Madrid. Senor, do you know the shortest way? Yes, that way. That's where the Holy Inquisition captured me. You're right. It's better to avoid their ambush. Don't you know any other way? Cabalists have no problems finding their way. We'll go around that place and get on the road to Madrid. In the books of Sefer Zohar, especially Sifra di-Tsni'uta, we get to know Sefirot, the depth of ten elements constituting the unity of deity. And this lets us get to the power controlling the pandemoniac world. Must you keep repeating incomprehensible words? They make the trip more interesting while controlling nightmares and demons, among which we distinguish Hungarian and Polish vampires which are nothing but corpses leaving their graves to suck on human blood. And the Spanish ones, which... Help! I arrest you in the name of the Holy Inquisition. Surrender your sword. Do not resist, Alphonse van Worden! I'm Don Pedro Velézquez! Are you mad, gentlemen? That's right... That's not him. So who is he? Don Pedro, as he said. He looked quite similar. - Why are you hanging around here, Senor? - I thought that roads are open to all! Senor bandits! There is no road here. Get out of here! Van Worden must have chosen a different route. Or maybe he returned to Venta Quemada? I was told he was coming here. You do not seem willing to apologize for your mistake. - Stop bothering me! Get away from here! - If so, please accept my apologies, Senors. A thorn. And nothing to remove it with! Bad luck! No place to hide. Naturally, to check the situation. - Senor Alphonse van Worden? - That's me. Ride no further, Senor. Some uneducated thugs are waiting for you there. The Inquisition? Indeed. And that surprises me. What's the Inquisition doing here? And they didn't recognize, Senor, that you are not van Worden? Apparently they didn't, since they attacked me. At least that's what logic tells us. Unbelievable. What now? You'll come, Senor, to my castle which is but a few miles from here. You have a castle nearby? - You haven't mentioned that, Senor. - A sign of commendable modesty. - And what if they find me? - They cannot enter my castle. We'll take the shortest route. If I also could count on your hospitality, Senor, I'd have a chance for a peaceful night. Knowing Senor cabalist he will not refuse a shelter. - Of course, I won't. - Thank you, Senor. I'll have time to ponder upon what's happened to me. Thinking of such matters may lead unqualified minds to madness. When used wisely, the human mind is capable of accepting anything. THE END OF PART ONE
