Zebraman! Zebraman! Zebraman! Zebraman! Uh...I am now standing in front of the home of Zebraman. Excuse me. Alright everyone, look right over this way. Look at all these cameras. Not only from Japan, but from all over the world. Proof that everyone is focused on Zebraman. The sudden attack by the extraterrestrial beings. The battle between the unidentified aliens and Zebraman, who bravely took them down single-handedly. And through his actions, saved the Earth and all its people. Oh...sorry, sorry... A mere school teacher Zebraman, previously an elementary school class year head teacher, became the world's hero overnight. Black and White, Baby! And now, one month later the worldwide hero Zebraman is still living quietly in this modest home. There he is! He's here! Zebraman is making his entrance. He seems to be in his pajamas. Unfortunately not in his Zebra costume. Right now one leg after the other Zebraman is taking the garbage out. I wonder if we'll hear him say his catchphrase today! Your "Black and White, baby!" catchphrase has apparently been chosen for an award. Will you be attending the award ceremony? No. There's no sign of your family... They went out. It's a little hard to hear you. Please speak up. They went out! It seems like you haven't been going to work recently. Isn't it enough already? Uh...could you look into the camera and pose for us? - Pose? - Yeah, a pose. Please, give us a "Black and White, baby!" Right...right here... Alright everyone, back up! Yeah, back up, back up. OK, shhhh.... Could you do it once more for everyone watching "Sunday Japon"? Huh? Asano-san? Asano-san! Asano-san! Asano-san! Zebraman! Zebraman! Zebraman! Zebraman! Asano-san! Asano-san! I can't do it. I couldn't hear you. A little louder please. I can't transform. I'm not Zebraman anymore. I'm telling you the truth. It was a one time thing that'll never happen again. No, it was just a dream. I can't believe it. No, I don't want to believe it. More than saving the world the countless human lives lost. Just thinking about how their families must feel... And at the same time I'm watched 24 hours a day by the mass media and the police I lost my family and my job. I just want to be left in peace. Please, just let me go! No way... Now you understand, right? It isn't over yet. How boring, throw on the black and white. This is Zebra City, a town of instinct. If you're a man, live a little. This is Zebra City, anything goes. When your viewpoint is the back the front is the back. When your viewpoint is black White is black. 5 minutes, only 5 minutes I want to feel refreshed. Dye it all zebra stripe. I am the Zebra Queen. I like zebra stripe. I am the Zebra Queen. I'll even paint your grave zebra stripe. I'm not scared, bring it on. This is Zebra City. I am the law. On or off, make it clear. It's zebra time, anything goes. When your viewpoint is evil, good is evil. When your viewpoint is female male is female. 5 minutes, only 5 minutes. I want to feel refreshed. Dye it all zebra stripe. I am the Zebra Queen. I like zebra stripe. I am the Zebra Queen. I'll paint the Diet building zebra stipe. 5 minutes, only 5 minutes. I wanna feel refreshed. Dye it all zebra stripe. I am the Zebra Queen. I like zebra stripe. I am the Zebra Queen. Dye it all zebra stripe. I am the Zebra Queen. I like zebra stripe. I am the Zebra Queen. I'll even paint your grave zebra stripe. No! No! No no no! No! No! What is this!? What is this!? This... People of the world, let's decide what's good or bad. cigarettes good or bad? National Pension is it good or bad? God damn it. We've got an emergency! This one's real bad! Let us through! Look out! It's an emergency! This one's an emergency. I'll look at him when it's his turn. Please line up in the hallway. I said it's an emergency, Asano. That means you need to look at him right away! If...if you don't look at him right away, he's gonna die right away! He was shot! How many times? Including his arm and his chest, over 100 times. And his bones are broken in 13 places. He's already dead. No I'm not. W..what the!? I said, "No I'm not." Teach... Huh? Teach? My homeroom teacher from elementary school. No... head teacher of that class year. Y...your teacher? In the gubernatoral elections two years ago, Aihara Kozou won, and Tokyo changed it's name to Zebra City. The 23 districts of Tokyo plus Musashino City and West Tokyo and the neighboring prefectures Saitama and Chiba as well as Kanagawa were all joined together. And an agressive urban planning strategy was pushed forward. Zebra City is a model city for experimental political reform. One of these reforms is Zebra Time Asano, he's not listening to you at all. That's because he's in a coma. Is he going to die? A normal person would have instantly died. So he's not normal, huh... Waaah, he came back to life! So, what's this Zebra time? And he was listening! He...he really isn't normal. Everyday at 5:00 AM and PM for 5 minutes, in other words, 10 minutes a day, it becomes OK for a police officer to shoot a citizen. Th...that's not all. For those with power, all criminal acts during Zebra Time will be forgiven. Administration of illegal drugs by doctors, abusive behavior towards their patients. Congressmen are untouchable. Burglary, assault, gang rape Unbelievable. It's just a city of crime, huh. That's not true. After the introduction of Zebra Time, the crime rate dropped to less than half. It is said that Zebra City is the most secure city in the world. Why? Variety. Good and evil. As the words state, we will accept our dual nature as human beings and build up a society run effectively through variety. Up until now all laws and ordinances were created from the viewpoint of good. And because of that our repressed evil side exploded and crime ran rampant. Aihara! Therefore, I have created new ordinances while recognizing the existence of evil. Next year, 17 American states will introduce Zebra Time according to correspondence I have received from the White House. Bullshit! All that happens is the weak are eliminated. I heard some kind of song. Some horrible cacophonous noise. It's gotta be ZebraQ. Zebra Q? Zebra Queen, Yui Aihara. The governor's daughter. The poster girl for Zebra City. It's pretty erotic, huh... Can't get much more erotic than this. Black and White, Baby. Zebra! Black and White... baby... Oww! - Ouch. - Please relax. It's just a stimulant. Wow... Not really relaxing. Heheh, a joke. Just an anesthetic. Wait, anesthetic... That's what you use before surgery, isn't it? I want to be a doctor. W...want to... You mean you're not a doctor!? I'm just a nurse. Huh? It's better than dying in a Zebra City hospital. We're lucky to be safe here. And we've got friends here. F...friends..? These guys? Just like you, they're victims of Zebra Time. I carried them here. There are many who came by themselves looking for help as well. But the majority of them I snuck into Zebra City to rescue. I don't remember asking you to. I'm a volunteer, damn it. Besides, the more people you have when the time comes... That time won't come. I don't believe in violence. Please don't speak of my beloved family as if they were soldiers. This is your family? Living in this world, we've all gotta work together to survive. So, Teach, where have you been for the last 15 years? What have you been up to? Teach? It seems this guy was your student. It's me, Asano, from Yachiyo Elementary School, class 3-1. By the way, I'm Ichiba. I'm in charge of rehabilitation. I'm a teacher? Huh? Oh...sorry. I don't remember. No, it's not just you. I don't remember anything. I mean, the last thing I remember was being on the streets. Sleeping on the streets. 15 years... I don't have any memories of sleeping that long. Amnesia... Are you serious? Zebraman... One more time, like before. Catch the light. The light is like power. Lift your chin. Touch your chest like this. A little lower. Yeah, like that. OK. Yeah. Like that. Close your eyes. Eyes closed. Yeah, like that. What's wrong Yui? You look upset. That time of the month? I not your puppet, Daddy. Misaki Mika. Pisses me off. Oh, this, huh? Come on, it's no big deal. You were number one for forty weeks. You'll hit number one again next time. Such an eyesore But you can understand how she feels, can't you Yui? Niimi, shut it off. There's always America. You may be able to make your American debut at the same time we introduce Zebra Time over there. Daddy, is it really OK if your Yui isn't number one? My cousin joined the police this spring. Huh? If he were to kill her during Zebra Time, there would be no incident. Just a thought. Good idea. Can it be done? No. we couldn't. It wouldn't be right. Are you Misaki? You know, the singer? Oh...yeah. Y...you're really cute. I'm a big fan. Could I have an autograph? Yeah, of course. Hmmmm... Such a nice person. Huh? Pisses me off. Yui-chan? Such a cute, nice girl. So young, and yet so level-headed. She really encouraged me to give it my all. I pray for her happiness in the next world. I'd like to dedictate this next song to Mika. Now feel the surge of the beat, the signal to get the crowd raging. You'll never get the chance to escape again. My time to shine, better luck next time. Deeply Close By Deeply Close By Even as dark eyes beckon Strongly Far Away Strongly Far Away A forced smile, are you serious? Blackout. Find someone, expose your soul No more hiding it all away Wrap up the lonliness set to break you Pay attention to the lingering memories Overflowing Tell me what these tears mean. The desolate horizon There is still no sign The value's shed, end of night Time to mystify Deeply Close Damn, she's erotic. No, she's more than erotic, she's dirty. Can I change it? Of course not, damn it. I'm watching. I just...I can't take this stuff. I mean, I physiologically can't handle it. The more this girl sings and dances I feel like I get weaker and weaker. At this rate, I'll never get better. Alright, you wanna watch a DVD? Which one? Mine. This one. I used to be an actor like this. An action star. Ze...bra...man? It's Zebraman! Huh? You don't know it? Hero of the people. He saved the Earth from an alien invasion. Ohh...sorry, sorry, sorry. You lost your memory, huh. How many years ago was this? 15 years ago. Anyway, watch it, it'll get your spirits up. It's so fun! Alright! Huh? Zebraman! Here I come, Alien! Don't you dare stand behind me! Huh? Zebra Kick! What the hell is this? You understand, right? It isn't over yet. Zebraman. Not over? How many times do I need to tell you? There's too much white. For me it needs more black. This one too. And this one. No...I thought this one looked pretty good on you. Do me a favor, don't stand behind me. Yui-san. You're on in five minutes. In that five minutes, countless people were killed again today. Useless, powerless lives have been erased. Doesn't it just turn you on? I... I understand your feelings completely. Hey, Niimi. Can I ask you something? 15 years ago the green aliens fed off the humans in the hopes of conquering Earth. And the one responsible for thwarting them was Zebraman. The clean up of ground zero cost the Defense Agency immensely. But the one responsible for the supervision of the recovery efforts was Aihara Kouzo. In other words, the current governor. Aihara found a girl. A girl with the green alien parasite inside of her. And that girl? She ran away. And the task of tracking her down is YOUR job. And when I find her? We begin the alien breeding process. Breeding? And then, the world... Don't be so reckless. Neither of you is to do anything. The miniskirts and I will take care of her capture. And when she's caught? She will be eliminated. She's too dangerous. You don't understand the horror of the extraterrestrial parasites. Of course I do. At least as well as you do. Oh, you're already on the last episode? Oh, he lost an ear... That's Yoshitaka, the monster controlled by the boss character, Yoshio. It was a real pain. The writer was slacking on the job. As long as Zebraman was still alive, the show couldn't end. The last episode was my idea. He would absorb the alien inside his body. Zebraman! Absorb? How? He'd eat him. Eat him? Zebra Sword! Are you serious? Yeah. Completely serious. Oh! He really ate him. That's a hero! Sacrificing himself. Huh? He's dead? Oi, what are you doing? Hey! Stop it! Hey! What the hell are you doing? Teach... You showed him this? Yeah, I did. Idiot. Who are you calling idiot? Re...respect your elders! It takes time to cure amnesia. If you rush it, it could have the reverse effect. I have no idea what you're talking about. Be more clear! Teach is Zebraman. I'M Zebraman! No, the real one! The one that fought the aliens and saved the world. I can't go along with Asano's plan. He's got no sense of crisis. So, a vigilante group? Yeah. I've been going out to save the victims of Zebra Time for that reason. Gathering all the best men for a full on assault of Zebra City. Preparing for that day. An assault on Zebra City? Will that day really come? Yeah. The day will come when good and bad will be decided. If we wish to protect the peace, we need to do so with violence. But Asano said he's against violence. Yeah, but... Sumire! Again? Careful! That girl, her name's Sumire? Sumire... I'm not really sure. Just like us, a victim of Zebra Time. She doesn't talk. She spends every day destroying the plants she grew herself. It's such a shame. Well then...about time for lunch, huh. Do you like flowers? Huh? They just looked like they hadn't been watered in a while. It doesn't matter. I'm just gonna break 'em anyway. Oh? Just now... you talked, didn't you? Yeah. You CAN talk. That's great, isn't it, Sumire-chan? I just didn't feel like talking. And my name's not Sumire. Oh... Well then, what is it? I don't want to say. Oh... OK. Anyway, look, you can always replant them. And then the next time, some beautiful flowers may grow. Yeah. What? Nothing... Just feel like I've met you before somewhere. Sorry, sorry, it's probably just a mistake. Old man, you were a teacher, right? Heh, seems that way. Dr. Asano's teacher. So the doctor's teacher, right? Yeah. That's right. Huh!? I...feel like I've met you before too. Zebraman? W...who? Let me touch you. Touch my hand. Huh? Touch my hand. Stop! What's wrong, Yui? AAAAGGGHH! What the hell!? Don't let go! Hold on tighter! Don't look! Ah! Wh...what the? Zebraman. Ze... Zebraman? Oh... Me? I...I'm Zebraman? But... You're white. Unbelievable. What are you? I don't know. But I'm definitely not normal. Just look at me. I mean... I'm 25. Huh!? T...twe...twe...twenty five? I just stopped growing... I was imprisoned. Because of my abilities. Some bad guys want to use them for evil. Evil? Help me. Help you? I know where the alien is. What? Yokohama City, Yachiyo District, East 1-3-23 That's pretty specific. The House of the White Horse. Yachiyo District, huh? Looks like we can't use Zebra Time. I told you, stay out of this! That bastard... He's alive. Daddy. Teach! Did your memory come back? I don't understand. But...she's calling. She? She's... Aihara Yui is me. Myself. Huh? You're a fan? I just want to settle this. You're not Zebraman! You're just a teacher. Nothing but a modest, serious teacher. He's white... Asano-san. Do me a favor. Protect your family. You're my family too. I... I have something I need to do. What time is it? 5:02 PM I've seen your face somewhere before. I'm the governor...of Zebra City. It's me, Aihara Kouzo. Did the governor look like this? I'm the one who created Zebra Time. I'm only joking. I know. Enough fooling around! Stop! Aaagh, STOP! St..stop... Please...stop! Ugh...I beg you, please stop! You guys...he...help me... What is this...? I made you... I made you... You're my creation! Breaking news. Governor Aihara has been assassinated by an unknown assailant. The government has announced the merging of the Yachiyo District of Yokohama City into Zebra City. In accordance, starting at 5:00 tomorrow morning Zebra Time will be introduced in Yachiyo. Huh? In a few minutes, Yui-san will hold a press conference. Everyone, please get ready to leave here. Huh? You're gonna run? There's no more time. This isn't a joke! Why do we need to leave this place? There's no time to argue. We need to evacuate immediately. Asano! I promised Teach. It's up to me to protect my family. My way. Alright then, me too. And I'll do it my way. That's awfully quick. Vigilantes! Gear up and meet me at the White Horse Bridge! Yeah! Let's go! Please tell us how the decision was made to merge Yachiyo this time. It was the will of my dead father, Kouzo. As a member of the Defense Agency he discovered evidence of an alien survivor living in Yachiyo, and he began his own investigation. What kind of investigation? Please don't worry about it. We are proud to have the Zebra Police, the biggest force in the world watching out for everyone's safety. This merger was done to eliminate the alien. Enough with the show! He's finally here. Get that man! Go on, say it. Show us your true colors. What are you? If you won't say it, I'll say it for you. You are me. YOU are ME. After him! Get him! The famous singer Yui Aihara was confronted by a stalker at her press conference. He was shouting things like "I am Yui Aihara. Yui is me." He is currently being pursued. Let's go! Full-on assault! According to the investigation, he was building a cult in Yachiyo. As a devotee to the House of the White Horse, there is a possibility that he was also involved in the assassination of Governor Aihara. Zebra City has begun a criminal investigation of the group. Is everyone here? Is there still anyone not here yet? Sumire-chan's not here! Alright everyone, show no fear! Let's show them the results of our training! Yeah! There you are. Come on, let's go. No! The old man, Zebraman, is gonna come save me. This is an announcement for your leader! Release your hostage and surrender! What do you mean, hostage? I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to you Asano! Come down here! Stay inside! Leave this to me! Maybe you didn't hear me. Leave this to the big fish. Ichiba! Ichiba-san! Ichiba-san! "Ichiba-san" huh? Just once more it would be nice to be called "Zebraman" again. Zebraman? That's right. The genuine article. Zebraman! Oh yeah, now I remember. I used to watch you on TV as a kid. I'm honored. Would you like to shake my hand? Ichiba-san. No you don't! Stay right here, OK? Zebraman! Zebraman! Zebraman! Zebraman! You're not going anywhere. Little girl. What is this? What are you saying she's done? This girl has an alien parasite inside her. What did you say? If you get in the way, it's obstruction of justice, you'll be killed and tossed aside. Huh? How strange. That was pretty cool. And now for the conclusion. Teach... Enough wasting time. You don't get it, do you, old man? There is nothing that a Japanese spirit cannot cut. I've come to finish things. Zebraman. Don't be so hasty. Let me refresh your memory. Take a look. You understand, right? It's not over yet, Zebraman. The reason you can't transform into Zebraman is because there is some doubt in your soul. Doubt? The fact that you saved humanity from crisis is the truth. However, there were countless people sacrificed to achieve it. Because of that you're suffering from feelings of guilt. You're frightened by your own ferocity. - Kishida Miho! - Yes? So tired... Switch over to fully automatic rotation. Yes, sir. Please stop... There are good people and there are bad people. There is white and there is black. That's Zebraman. Stop...enough already! Let's separate black from white. Using centrifugal force. Hey! What was that last thing? Wait. What do you mean? Centrifugal force? I... was put in a centrifuge. And then? Then? Like I said, we're gonna separate the black and white. With centrifugal force. The black and white inside of you. In other words, separate good from evil. Huh? This room was created using the newest advances in engineering. An ultrahigh-speed centrifuge. It was created to reach up to 8000 rotations per second. Using this centrifuge a person will be separated into black and white, good and evil. So basically, a person will be split into two? Exactly. By centrifugal force, right? Exactly. No way. It can't be possible. Have you tested it? What are you saying? Hey. Hello? HEY! This is the test right now. WHAT!? N...NOW! The switch! Throw the switch! Yeah, that's it! From morning till night, 18 hours a day at 8000 revolutions per second, over and over again for five years, and then? You were... I was... born. Stop! Turn it off! It worked. Black and white were successfully separated! I have no need for you. You're just the cast-off shell. Success! And it's female. It's a girl! A bigger chest would be good. And a tighter ass. Yeah, tighter, tighter... Gorgeous... Smell's so nice. That was me. Are you serious? I'm your black side. Liberated from your bullshit sense of justice and morals. As it were... your evil turned solid. Zebra City and Zebra Time, you were responsible for everything, huh? That's right, it was me. In other words, you're responsible through Aihara Kouzo. I never thought you'd still be alive. The day after I was born you were discarded. Discarded? But, you're still alive. The cast-off shell. And what's more, you were with the alien. What do you mean "She escaped."? I'm very sorry! What does this mean daddy? I can't transform either? Calm down Yui. Are you saying I can't become Zebrawoman? Find her! Find her and bring her back at once! It's so horrible... To have been locked up in this small body all this time. There's no reason to be so sad. This doesn't concern you. Tell me. What is your plan? Introduce Zebra Time all over the world, get rid of all the weak, useless, unneccessary people, and bring upon world peace. Unneccessary people? Guys like you. With friends, family, Weak social creatures who can't live without relying on others. Is that what peace means to you? Do you really believe that? Haha, that's right. And to do it I'm going resurrect this one. Breed the aliens and throw the world into panic. Then, when I defeat those aliens the world will choose me, Zebrawoman, as their new hero. Enough bullshit. Don't you dare stand behind me! Black zebra! It's not cool to just throw your cigarette butt on the ground. I love this. This is great. I'm gonna kill you slowly! I'll protect you Yui. Niimi... I'll take care of this. Why? If it's for you, I'm willing to die. How annoying. Huh? This mushy stuff really annoys me. Sumire-chan! Stay away! It's all my fault. If it wasn't for me... No, you're wrong. It's not your fault. You've done everything you could to keep the alien sealed away. Doctor, thank you. Sumire-chan! Are you alright? Where's Sumire-chan? Black Zebra took her... What about Ichiba? He took everyone to a safe location. Where are you going? To Zebra City, where else? People of the world, today, the Defense Agency, in cooperation with the excellent police force of Zebra City, have successfully captured the alien parasite. Sumire-chan... The alien parasite that threatened all of humanity is living inside the body of this little girl, And through it's elimination it will bring about peace. The time of world peace that we've been striving for is getting closer by the moment. And now, the ambassador of peace! Zebra Queen! Zebra Queen! Zebra Queen! Zebra Queen! Zebra Queen! Zebra Queen! Zebra Queen! Zebra Queen! Black and White, Baby! Stop! Alright, come on out! No! You can't let it out! Come on. Come out already! Teach! Here, take over! The cast-off trash! What are you here for!? Enough! Switch it over to fully automatic rotation! Yes, ma'am. We can't just let this happen. What a disgusting creature you are. I wish you'd just die. Do you want to know why I won't die? Enough. It's because you're still living. Enough! All this stuff about you being me, it makes me want to vomit! Well, if you really insist on me being you, here goes. Worked to the bone for petty wages Students, coworkers, PTA, hell, even my family, constantly putting me down. Constantly with the laughing. Day by day, watering the flowers, wasting life away. That's who you are. Enough! So tedious and boring. To be connected with this boring little nothing of a man Me... I am nothing like you! Here it comes! Please! Let me through! Please! Excuse me! It's him... The boss from the last episode. Ichiba-san! Are you alright, Ichiba-san? Teach! Sumire-chan! It looks good on you. You make a good nanny. More! Destroy it all! Bastard! Ichiba-san! Who do you think you're messing with? Hey, hey, are you alright? Zebraman... B...black AND white... Huh? Go win this. Ichiba-san! Yes? Huh..? What!? Niimi... I... since I was a kid... I've always hated leaving things undone. I told you, didn't I? I would die for you... You are amazing... Moron... Damn you. What's this? What the hell is this? Turn it black. I'm gonna turn it all black! Enough, Yui! That's enough. Shut up! I'll take him down...become a god! Let go. Fusion. What!? We need to join up. The only way to defeat him is for us to merge together. Quit screwing around! I hate you! I'm not happy about it either. But you are my other self. A part of me. You understand, don't you, Yui? Complete Black Complete White, these things don't exist. I won't allow myself to turn away from reality anymore. I mean, I am 25. You still have tears left to cry. Now, it's time for us to become one. Really? Zebraman! Zebra Beam! He's absorbed the power and is growing! Ichiba-san, how did the climax of the last episode turn out? The last episode? How did he take down the alien? Oh, that's right. No, no, there's no way... If you do that, you'll... I've got to, don't I? No, you can't! Asano-san. Can I ask you one question? If I finish this, can it really bring people happiness? Teach! Teach, it's no use! It's too big! No black and white this time but I got a'ROUND' to finishing it. Teach... That was too damn cool! If you truly believe If I truly believe Dreams come true. Zebraman! Zebraman! Zebraman! Zebraman! Zebraman! Zebraman! Zebraman! Zebraman! Zebraman! Zebraman! Zebraman! Zebraman! Zebraman! Teach! Thanks. Now feel the surge of the beat, the signal to get the crowd raging.
