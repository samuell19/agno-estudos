[ Modest Mouse's "Float On" playing ] ♪♪ [ Train horn blows ] ♪♪ ♪♪ - ♪ And we'll all float on okay ♪ ♪ And we'll all float on alright ♪ ♪ Already, we'll all float on alright ♪ - The last few weeks have been an emotional time. I know it has been for me and Ciara, and our hearts are hurting. - We keep faith at the center of our family, especially during difficult times such as the ones we're currently facing. We praise that we learn how to love, we learn how to communicate, and we learn how to unite to become stronger through the process. - We're talking a lot here at home, having difficult conversations with our friends, our teammates, and family. We're talking about how we can make a change for our kids to have a better future for America, how we strengthen our communities through direct actions, how we treat one another with love, respect, and care, but also understanding. - The global pandemic opened our eyes to a world in which it was imperative we come together and support our fellow humans in need. And as our world was beginning to find its new normal, a light has been shone on the harsh realities of hundreds of years of oppression. - And once again, we find ourselves uniting together in support of black lives, not just here in America, but globally. And one thing is true... One person can't fix it all. We have to work together to fight injustices. This is going to be a long climb up that mountain towards change. We need to push forward, to do better. This is why we love Washington. We know how to get things done. And right now, we can make a change. We mustmake a change. So let's start tonight and do everything in love. - That's what the "All In Washington Concert for COVID-19 Relief" is all about. We're coming together to raise spirits and money that will provide financial assistance to our most vulnerable and affected citizens. That means food to families in need, help with healthcare and housing costs. In addition, under the leadership of some amazing black women, the All In Washington organizers have created the Black Future Co-Op Fund, which will be led by black leaders in Washington state. Black people are disproportionately affected by COVID-19, partially due to systemic failure and disparities that are related to structural racism. Tonight's event will help bring resources to our black communities who are in most need of this support. - This is a chance to do some real good. Right now, through a special Washington concert, and you can direct your donation to the Black Future Co-Op Fund. - So let's kick it off with four generations of Seattle hip-hop, performing together for the first time ever.

Bill Nye here, longtime Pacific Northwest resident, and I'm gonna talk about how Washington state is going to beat the COVID-19 virus. We're gonna beat it with data, with science. So, here's how we've done as well as we've done so far. First of all, we locked down. This makes a huge difference, because people aren't outside transmitting the virus to people around them. See, here's the thing... You can get sick with the COVID-19 virus, get infected, and not even know it without having any symptoms for several days. This is what makes this virus so dangerous. The second thing we did is we kept our physical distance, our social distance. And this makes a big difference because the main way this virus is transmitted is through particles in the air. And that's why we all got to wear our masks. You don't need to take your mask off to have a conversation. And you got to not expose your nose. If your nose is exposed, you might as well be spitting on people. So, wear your mask. - "All In Washington Concert for COVID Relief," because nobody gets it done better than Washington. - Hey, Washington. It's your friend Allen Stone here, born and raised in Chewelah, Washington. You know, my favorite part about Washington is the music. Quincy Jones learned how to play horn here. He bumped into Ray Charles down at the clubs in Seattle, and they came up together. Soundgarden, Nirvana, Pearl Jam. But tonight wouldn't be complete unless we paid tribute to the main himself, the one who owned Garfield High, who wear a purple boa and orange striped pants, and he set the entire world on fire with his guitar. The man I'm talking about is Mr. James Marshall Hendrix. Here to perform James' classic "All Along the Watchtower," The Black Tones. ♪♪ - ♪ There must be some kind of way outta here ♪ ♪ Said the joker to the thief ♪ ♪ There's too much confusion, yeah ♪ ♪ I can't get no relief ♪ ♪ Business men, they... they drink my wine ♪ ♪ Plowmen dig my earth ♪ ♪ None will level on the line ♪ ♪ Nobody offered his word, yeah ♪ ♪♪ ♪ No reason to get excited ♪ ♪ The thief, he kindly spoke ♪ ♪ There are many here among us, yeah ♪ ♪ Who feel that life is but a joke ♪ ♪ But, uh, but you and I, we've been through that ♪ ♪ And this is not our fate ♪ ♪ So let us stop talkin' falsely now, yeah ♪ ♪ The hour's getting late, hey ♪ ♪ Hey ♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ - Hi. My name is Tatum Dahl. I got COVID-19 in late March, kind of early April. I had a fever. I had chills. I felt really fatigued. And while I was worried about myself, I was more worried about the people close to me, like my father, who had pre-existing conditions. And I'd done a lot of reading and was worried about some of those long-term effects that I've heard about... complications for people that have had COVID and recovered along the line. It sounds like those effects can be pretty concerning. We passed the days in self-isolation for another 15 days after a positive test, and we just listened to Brandi Carlile albums, and I binge-watched "Friends" at night, and it made the days go by faster. It really did. - Hello. - Stop. - Hi, Tatum. - Hi, Monica. [ Laughs ] - You were home, You quarantined. You were watching "Friends," and I've actually been watching "Friends" during this quarantine, too, because... - No way! No way. - Yeah. Heard your story because I've been quarantining with two friends here that, uh, both of them got COVID, as well. One was asymptomatic, and his husband went to the hospital... ventilator, kidneys shut down, the whole thing. He was in the hospital for 18 days. It's just crazy how it affects different people... - Differently. 100%. My little sister was pretty much completely asymptomatic, and once we got our test results back, and she was positive, thank God we've been taking this seriously all along, or she could've really affected a lot of people negatively without even knowing it, and it was kind of a scary realization to come to. - Did your dad... You said he has asthma? - Yeah, he has asthma. - But he got through it and didn't have to go to the hospital? He was able to... That's so good. - He was able to recover at home. At the beginning of like February, I remember being like, "Okay, this is a real thing. I pray to God that my dad of all people doesn't get this, 'cause I know that it would affect him." And he's okay now, so... - On the other side of it. Wow. - Yeah. Wow. - I'm so happy to meet you. - [ Chuckles ] - Thanks for telling your story. That's so important. Thank you so much for doing that. I'm not from Washington, but I have a friend who is from Washington, and she happens to be quarantining with her whole band. So maybe we can get her to play a song. Let's see. - Let's do it. I'm down. [ Laughs ] - Brandi? - Thank you, Courtney. Thank you so much for your intro. We're not gonna do "The Joke" tonight because you own that song now. You've already out-shone us on it, so we're going to do a different song. -2, 3, 4. ♪♪ - ♪ All of these lines across my face ♪ ♪ Tell you the story of who I am ♪ ♪ So many stories of where I've been ♪ ♪ And how I got to where I am ♪ ♪ But these stories don't mean anything ♪ ♪ When you've got no one to tell them to ♪ ♪ It's true ♪ ♪ I was made for you ♪ ♪♪ ♪ I climbed across the mountaintops ♪ ♪ Swam all across the ocean blue ♪ ♪ I crossed all the lines, and I broke all the rules ♪ ♪ But, baby, I broke them all for you ♪ ♪ Oh, because even when I was flat broke ♪ ♪ You made me feel like a million bucks ♪ ♪ You do, oh, and I was made for you ♪ Go. ♪ And, ooh ♪ ♪ And ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ And ooh, o-ooh ♪ ♪ And ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Ohh ♪ ♪ Ohh, ohh, ohh ♪ ♪♪ ♪ You see the smile that's on my mouth ♪ ♪ It's hiding the words that don't come out ♪ ♪ And all of my friends who think I am blessed ♪ ♪ They don't know my head is a mess ♪ ♪ No, they don't know who I really am ♪ ♪ And they don't know what I've been through like you do ♪ ♪ And I was made for you ♪ ♪♪ ♪ And all of these lines across my face ♪ ♪ Tell you the story of who I am ♪ ♪ So many stories of where I've been ♪ ♪ And how I got to where I am ♪ ♪ Oh, but these stories don't mean anything ♪ ♪ When you've got no one to tell them to ♪ ♪ It's true ♪ ♪ I was made for you ♪ ♪ Oh, yeah, well, it's true ♪ ♪ That I was made ♪ ♪ For you ♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ - On Friday, February 28th, I received a call that we had our first coronavirus-positive patient in our intensive care unit at EvergreenHealth in Kirkland, and I remember feeling that pit in my stomach. And as that weekend progressed, it was almost as if a huge tidal wave was coming across our hospital. I knew our lives were going to change. - [ Crying ] It's hard for the family, and it's hard for us nurses 'cause we take care of the patient, but we also care for the families. It's really rough, but we're making it through. - I know that nursing is my calling, but I never thought that I was training to become an ICU nurse for a pandemic. - Oftentimes, they're fine, and then the next second, they're not. It can be really, really scary. - I had a patient who spoke Spanish, and throughout the time that I had him, I always made sure that I told him, you know, "Keep on going, echale ganas," and cheered him on. - I was feeling all sorts of just heartbreak, and here is my 89-year-old grandpa, and there I was, in the room taking care of my grandpa, and all the rooms surrounding him, people were dying. - There was a husband and wife. He was hospitalized with us, and she was hospitalized at another local hospital. She died. The family asked us to FaceTime so that he could see her. [ Crying ] And then he said this most beautiful eulogy, and part of it was that, "I'll never see you again," and, you know, remembering their life and how beautiful she was and how smart she was and just wishing her goodbye. - Our team is unbreakable. We cannot do it without working together. I've never experienced anything like it, and I doubt I will again. I'm really proud of Washington. - Everything the community has done by staying home, by wearing masks, has allowed us to not only take care of the patients that we had in the best way but make sure that any patient will get whatever resource they need for the chance to get better. - Hi, everybody. I hope this finds you and your loved ones safe. As these are incredibly difficult times, tonight, I will do something I rarely do... be sincere. I told my wife about this approach, and she asked, "Does this mean you'll be sincere all the time from now on? Because that would be wonderful." And I put my hand on her shoulder, and I said, "I don't know. Ask me tomorrow." So, in all sincerity, tonight, we have to come together to honor all the work that's been done to quell this virus in Washington state and continue to do some good. There are still those deeply affected by this virus who need help. - Hi, I'm Mimi Jung from "KING 5," and I want to send my love to everyone in my hometown of Puyallup right now, which many of you know is where the rest of Washington goes for those amazing fair scones. I am so proud to be a part of this event which is bringing so many wonderful people together to keep Washington strong. Now, what is the All In Washington Fund, and how does it work? All In Washington is a collective of community organizations, non-profits, and the United Way, along with the help of local companies and foundations which help raise funds for the most vulnerable in this state. They're helping thousands of Washingtonians struggling with food insecurities. They're helping to keep our kids fed, especially those who are on free and reduced lunch programs. And they're providing funding to all of the food banks across our state through the Washington Food Fund. And along with food insecurities, these funds will go to helping workers all across this state, including those who are undocumented. All donations will be matched dollar-for-dollar by Jeff Bezos. - Nationwide, black people continue to disproportionately... - Disproportionately... - Disproportionately... - Contract COVID-19 and to die from the virus. - And die from the virus. - We represent 14% of the U.S. population, yet we make up 30% of the COVID cases. - The Black Future Co-Op Fund was designed by black women, dynamic black women, and it is a long-term commitment supporting grassroots organizations to legacy organizations like the Urban League. - The purpose of the Black Future Co-Op Fund is to acknowledge the harm that systemic racism has done to the black community in Washington state. - With an intentional focus on the future of children and families. Black folks just have not had an opportunity to generate wealth. We can see that through gentrification. We can see that through the wealth gap in Washington, specifically in King County. It is an echo of what folks are fighting for on the streets, and it is a long-term commitment to the future of black Washingtonians that have often been unseen. - The Black Future Co-Op Fund will support community-based programs like Career Bridge. - Because of COVID and with everything going on, I feel like these programs are a good experience for people that don't have jobs or food on the table, a roof over their head. Whoever is willing to actually get into these programs, I feel like it's a good opportunity. - There were a few shelters... I don't know the exact names... that were housing 18-to 24-year-olds that were going to close because of COVID-19. And in about two weeks, we were able to clear out a basement, get it up to fire code. - We set up an emergency shelter for young people experiencing homelessness. It was important for us to not just offer them shelter but offer them a pathway to self-sufficiency. And while they are there being safe, they offer the Career Bridge class. - We need to make sure we are building our workforce post-pandemic. - Welcome to Career Bridge, ingenious, creative young people. Are you ready to learn something new? Now's that time. We're not into barriers. We're not into people who reject us. We're into using our minds to get ahead and create opportunities. If you've never taken the time to do an inventory on your skill set, now's that time. - Oh, yeah, he's excellent teacher, really, better than any other teacher I've had in the past. They're nice people, and if you need anything, they'll provide it for you. If you ask for help, they'll help you in any way they can. But if they can't help you, they'll give you suggestions on how you could do it to try to help yourself. - All of my children were born in Washington state. ♪♪ I love this place. ♪ Don't give up, I know you can see ♪ ♪ All the world and the mess that we're making ♪ ♪ Can't give up and hope God will intercede ♪ ♪ So come on back ♪ ♪ Imagine that we could get it together ♪ ♪ Stand up for what we need to be ♪ ♪ 'Cause crime won't save or feed a hungry child ♪ ♪ Can't lay down and wait for some miracle to change things ♪ ♪ So lift up your eyes, lift up your heart ♪ ♪ Singing, mercy, will we overcome this? ♪ ♪ Oh, one by one, could we turn it around? ♪ ♪ Maybe carry on just a little bit longer ♪ ♪ I want to give you ♪ ♪ I want to give you what you need ♪ ♪ Me and you and you and you ♪ ♪ We just want to be free, yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ But you see, all the world is just as we've made it ♪ ♪ And until we got a new world ♪ ♪ We got to say that love is not a whisper or a weakness ♪ ♪ No, love is strong ♪ ♪ So we got to get together, yeah ♪ ♪ Gotta get, we gotta get, we gotta get ♪ ♪ Till there is no reason to fight ♪ ♪ Mercy, will we overcome this? ♪ ♪ Or have we gone too far to turn it around? ♪ ♪ Do we ask too much to be a little bit stronger? ♪ ♪ I want to give you ♪ ♪ I want to give you what you ♪ ♪ Mercy, what will become of us? ♪ ♪ Oh, one by one, could we turn it around? ♪ ♪ Maybe carry on just a little bit longer ♪ ♪ I want to give you ♪ ♪ I want to give you what you need ♪ ♪♪ ♪ So lift up your eyes ♪ ♪ Lift up your heart ♪ Thank you.

We've got about a billion pounds of processing potatoes that are still in storage that have no home. Today, we've got a great assortment of products. We've got 100,000 pounds of potatoes from Washington-grown farms, and we believe, at this time, we're serving 55,000 people at week, plus a newly vulnerable wave of individuals who are seeking assistance, many for the first time, as unemployment in our region really skyrockets. An additional 800,000 Washingtonians are at risk of hunger as a result of the response to the coronavirus. We've conducted distributions at this site for the last two weeks. We have run out of food at every distribution. - My husband, he's a truck driver, and his employment was pretty steady.

You know, the people, you can tell, really, really need it, and it's brought the community together. - We thought, with all of these people that have lost their jobs, we wanted to help. - I just want to say that there's a lot of good happening in Spokane. - Hey, Washington, I'm Edouardo Jordan, chef and owner of Junebaby, Salare, and Lucinda Grain Bar in Seattle. In these challenging times, it's important that we support each other. And by giving tonight, you're doing three critical things. One, you're supporting the farmers that have been so good to us over the years. Two, you're supporting small businesses. And three, you're making a bigger, brighter future for people in black and brown communities, and I thank you. - Okay.

Best dessert at a bake sale. - Salmon-skin pie or bark? - I vote bear turds. - Nobody even wants to eat it. - Hold on, you guys. What are you guys talking about? Like, no one should be throwing a bake sale right now. It's not safe. And it's especially not safe with giant, hairy, carnivorous Bigfoots. Big... Big... - It's Sasquatches. - Sasquatches.

Jay and I want to thank you for watching tonight, and supporting All In Washington. - You know, we've really been doing some noble work here in Washington the last few weeks. We've bent the COVID curve down. Now we're gonna bend the arc of justice up. We will continue to speak up against police violence. We know we need independent investigations for justice in our law-enforcement community. You know, there's a lot to be proud of our state, and we are certainly proud of what we're doing tonight, making sure that people can eat, that they can get services, and to end the inequities of our society. Thanks for being part of All In Washington. - We also want to thank you for continuing in the fight against COVID-19 by wearing your mask and physically distancing when in public so we can safely reopen. - "All In Washington Concert for COVID Relief," because nobody gets it done better than Washington. - For more than 40 years, we've called Washington state home. This is a challenging time for our community. As COVID-19 impacts all of us, we're also reckoning with the effects of systemic racism on members of the African-American and black community. We have to do better.

I have been attempting to support small businesses during this pandemic by ordering from local restaurants or retail stores... basically anywhere that offers takeout or delivery, because every order really does help. I'm also really trying to support black-owned businesses, and you can, too. Hit up Ezell's Famous Chicken, The Comfort Zone, or Junebaby, just to name a few. P.S., Junebaby actually will ship you their famous cornbread mix and jam. So, if you can, shop local, support your community, and always, always, always wear a face mask when you go and pick your stuff up. - Tacoma is a very tight-knit community... a lot of hardworking individuals, a lot of independent business owners. And it's pretty extraordinary, actually. The Red Hot shut down March 16th. I think worrying about our staff and, you know, their wellbeing has probably been the toughest hurdle. - Initially when we closed down, it was a staff of 28, but we've been a staff of 3 since March 31st. - We're a restaurant. We're a pub. We're an art gallery, a music venue.

We're all trying to do whatever we possibly can to stay somewhat in business. - Having funds coming in is amazing.

Just hearing the word "miracle," I didn't realize how close I was to death. It's been hard to pinpoint exactly where I contracted the virus. Friday, March 13th, I had a fever, went to urgent care. They decided that I needed to go to the E.R. My respiratory wasn't looking very good. My lungs were filled with pneumonia. I just couldn't get my oxygen levels up. They said, "We're gonna have to put you on the ventilator." - I didn't actually find out that he was going on the ventilator till about two minutes before. I had no time to prepare our kids, letting them know that Dad would be alone, because Ryan... we couldn't be at the hospital with Ryan. It was tough, 'cause we just didn't know if we'd talk to him again. - It was almost like a movie. I was just a wreck. All the wires and the tubes and everything that was coming off the ventilator and other machines. We were able to get a phone in there. My family would read to me. They would put 8, 12 hours in. - It was hard to get over the sound of the ventilator. If they were in there doing breathing treatments on him, he would start coughing, which was really hard for us to hear. - They were just so positive. That additional support really helped me get through. April 17th, I was discharged from the hospital.

And as a member of the black community, we're disproportionately affected by COVID-19. And as someone with asthma, ensuring I have accurate information about the disease has been vital. That's why I was so proud to learn that a kid from my home state built and launched a COVID-tracking website that almost every country in the world is using to trace the spread of the virus. And just a couple weeks ago, he used that same technology to build a website to help protesters track and donate to the Black Lives Matter movement. It's pretty incredible, right?

I was afraid to ask for help because there's such a stigma around being homeless. And then I ended up getting connected with a case manager at New Horizons, and she was able to show me that everybody needs help sometimes. - COVID-19 has terrorized the homeless community. With the closing of businesses and libraries, families have nowhere to go in and use the bathroom or even wash their hands. - A lot of programs that usually help with housing or clothes. So it put a halt on a lot of people trying to get into homes. - People really don't know what you've been through unless you really get to know them. I came here with my mom. They actually help you try to get where you're going and find you a job and housing. They want you to be successful in life. - Once I saw that, I wanted it for myself, and then I started working really hard, and we've just gone up together from there. - The Mary's Place shelter in The Regrade provided by our Amazon family has been our saving grace. It was available to us right at the start of this COVID-19 pandemic. And as we had to create more space for social distancing, this became our safe haven. The homelessness crisis won't go away on its own. It will take all of us to help and serve and love our neighbors. There are over 12,000 people living outside, unsheltered, in our community, and all of them just wanting the same things that we all have... the ability to stay home and to stay safe.
