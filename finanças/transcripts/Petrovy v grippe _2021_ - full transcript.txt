A film by Kirill Serebrennikov Your ticket? Based on the novel by Aleksey Salnikov Nothing to show me? Pay the fare then. Come on, pay the fare. What are you looking at? Gawking at me! What if I'm Snow Maiden? What if I melt? Take a seat. Nobody ever gives up their seat for the disabled. Look at them, staring out the windows. Sit down! Don't stand on that leg of yours. Thanks, but... Have a seat, you look cancerous. - What? - You've got cancer. It's just the flu. Fares, please. We used to get free vouchers to a sanatorium every year. It was for the good of the people. And now where are we? Old Gorby sold us out, Yeltsin pissed it away. then Berezovsky got rid of him, appointed these guys, and now what? Stinking immigrants everywhere. I mean, just look! The place is swarming with Tajiks. There used to be true friendship among nations, but now, it's the Tajiks and Jews who actually rule this country. The Jews got all of the Party's gold reserves, and only they hold power. All those currently holding power should be shot! All of them! Come here! Come on, you pussy! You pussy, move it! Here! Move, you pussy. Here he is, Pops! Help us out, kid. Guys, form a line! Here, I'll show you. Here's the safety, the bolt, and the trigger. Get to it. Come on, get out! Quick! Move! Move! What's going on? Walk straight ahead, move! Keep moving. Come on! Move! What's going on? This is illegal! We demand a trial! No talking allowed. No talking allowed. Get ready! Fire! Give me that back. Good job. PETROV'S FLU Cheer up! Get off already! Beware of the non-closing doors! Let's see your pass, then! - I'm joking. - Yeah, alright. Have a seat here. Oh, thank you! Such a good girl. - How old are you? - I'm nine. Nine? Did you know that in India and Afghanistan, girls can be married off at seven years old? Can you imagine that? You could've been married for two years by now, been screwing your husband for two years already. You might even have... cheated on him. All of you... bitches are the same. What's all this? WE ARE ALL EQUAL TO ZERO Jerk! What a rotten pig. In olden times, people like him were respected, considered blessed. People used to go to them for advice. But look how it is now... They can say anything on TV, but speak your mind here... Why did he grab him? The old man wasn't hurting anyone. Should've just left him. That asshole dragged him out... What, 'cause of that little bitch? What did he say wrong? Wasn't hurting anyone. Just sitting there... Didn't even go one stop. Look at him, throwing an elderly person off... What did he do wrong? What if he kicked you off like that? What's up? Why did we stop? What's going on? Ladies and gentlemen, please keep calm! This is an FSB special operation. Petrov, please get off. Mr. or Mrs. Petrov? I'm Mrs. Petrov. My maiden name is Kondratieva. No, not you. I'm Mrs. Petrov! It's me, Mrs. Petrov! We need Mr. Petrov. Oh, there he is by the window. Don't look so surprised. Or do you want a "Pretty please"? Here's to getting away with things, just like the FSB! Don't go spilling anything. Careful back there! Have a drink with us. Just half a glass. Let's celebrate! I'll join you once I've got the stiff sorted. Come on, he's not going anywhere! Besides, who'd stop a dead wagon? Alright. Igor, could persuade the dead. You guys are quite the designers. They're all a bit like me at our funeral home. One's a singer, kicked out of the conservatory for drunkenness. Another's a writer. And there's an artist. The writer is actually a poet. A robust old dude, quite hard-headed. He also runs a poetry club in the library. Must be where my wife works. She feels sorry for the people who go to his weekly meetings. Says she wants to lock them in and burn it down, to end their suffering. So you're married? Divorced. The light's green. Is there really a corpse in here? Or did you just say that to scare me? Take a look. It's, like... a corpse in a suit. Some guy. Igor... It's fine! I wouldn't mind if someone kept me in this world a little longer. Back in Soviet times, when I was at Naval College, I won the silver medal in boxing in Estonia. Drink to that! Here's to New Year! You sure it's OK that we kidnapped a body and are kinda desecrating it? Won't we be prosecuted? Long as they don't kill us. I'm with you, it stinks of corpse here. You guys get some fresh air. Wait! Stop! Son of a bitch! What an asshole! Damn asshole... Asshole. So, you work at a funeral home? Heh, no. Just bumped into... a guy I know. What have we got here? I'll catch a breath. You do that. Button up! You're awful sweaty. - Flu. - Gimme a cig... Guess I should be going home, too. What are you gonna do at home? Die alone? My son might visit... - Or my wife. - But you're divorced! You won't be getting any visitors. Oh, and give me your cell number. Don't have one. Don't want me calling you, huh? You could say that. It's one thing to run into you, but I'm not sure I wanna keep in touch. I'm not all that clingy. Hey, Vitya, that you? It's me, Igor. A buddy and I want to drop by, to discuss your thesis. Alright, your doctorate, then! Busy doing what, exactly? Vitya, that's ridiculous. What work could you possibly have? This guy's sick, he wants to see you, and you're claiming "work"? Is she at least cute? Don't just stare. I'm talking to you! Can you even hear me? First it was the Marquis de Sade, then prison camps. So what? Now it's books on gynecology. Why do you care? - Just observing. - It's none of your business. Mrs. Petrova... Nurlanesad Fatkhi... Fatkhiakhmetovna. QUIET Freakin' immigrants, acting like savages... Us Russians will soon go extinct. What happened, Alina? Bumped into something. THEY ARE AMONG US Gynecology! Kirill, Yuliy... ...not a single book, not even Gogol! Quiet! Let go of... Excuse me, can we take the sofa for our club? To put it on the podium. Keep your hands off the sofa! I told you so. The poets complain that it's like a Communist Party meeting. They'll be fine. Do you like it? Nice pattern. Is the draft bothering anybody? All OK? First of all, we are the hosts here, aren't we? Sorry, my dear. Please meet today's guests. Welcome. KEEP SILENT Vsevolod, Yuliy, and Kirill. Irina! When it's over, lock the door, leave the key with security. The sofa! My husband and I conceived our two elder kids on that sofa. Oh, the things it's witnessed! Irina Aktsibush! It's a sort of anthem. Whales inch their way out of the seas they were born in For everywhere is their home They're told, "Avoid sands, buoys, and nets!" But they're like: "Who gives a fuck?" It's such a pleasure to see their graceful movements Causing so many waves It's a pleasure to see how Amid all this mess And all those waves The whales look sleek as bottles or satin-sided moles Or it's a pleasure to see that they know That beauty is not that It's in the knowledge that the sea Is bounded by the shore, and yet never ends Whales inch their way out of the seas they were born in For everywhere is their home Bravo! "Little white books "and little red books "Lined the bookshelves of my childhood "A library of modern science fiction "But they're all trashed by careless bastards "I'd toss and turn in bed all night "Dreaming "of flying my spaceship "through the stars "To fly between black holes "Now I sit on my ass, "on a cheap stool "And know I'll never conquer Mars..." "...The gate we enter foaming at the mouth "Or rather not, for they've washed us like corpses..." "Here we can see the twigs of the burning bush..." "But there's no devil here to help us out. "So hold on to your crew "or faint. "The crew I mean "are our fathers and their fathers. But they are liars, these adults!" Why do you write such long poems? Let's say a hundred years ago, someone wrote a poem: "Oh sky, oh sky, I shall dream of you "It could not be that you've gone utterly blind "And the day burned up like a blank page a little smoke and a little ash." He has conveyed his message in just a few words. It's simple: it means you've never read a long poem. I have short poems, too! Four lines! "This morning, by the beer tent "I thought I glimpsed her slit "Am I overwrought? Or has my conscience gone to shit?" - Hi. - Are you home? Yes. - So you're back from school? - Yes. - Did you get hit by a car? - No! - Attacked by a psycho? - No! Are you playing? Will you be home soon? I don't know. There's the poetry club tonight. - How did the math test go? - I got a C. Come in! OK, first you do your homework, then you can play and watch TV. Excuse me, could I use your phone to call the police, please? Just one comment about the length of the poem and then he pounced on her! Fuck such poets! You piece of shit! May I? Do mop up the blood. It makes me queasy. Do you box? Oh, that, no. I just saw it in the movies. It just kind of happened. Some asshole spent all night by your balcony Howling his serenade at full volume You poured seven liters of dish water down from above And cursed him out, the crappy troubadour... He kinda said no. But who the hell cares? What if he just doesn't open? We'll just keep knocking till he does. Doesn't the stink of onion give you a headache? You got Cipollino's corpse here somewhere? You give me a headache. Vitya, are you still mad about last time? And about the time before that, too! And it was in moving northwards, that all was lost. What do we believe in now? Exactly! The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. That means Jupiter, Hercules and Mercury as one entity. And if we go even further back, Zeus, Hercules, and Hermes. We just adapted the stories, rejected some of the myths, and suddenly, we're not pagans. But in fact we still are! Victor Mikhailovich! I'm afraid you might have a stroke in your religious ecstasy. All these patron saints of this or that is sheer paganism. They could have saved all their effort! Let 'em keep on praying to their Ancient Greek and Roman gods! We need to make peace with the Arabs and live in our own way! My neighbors are assholes. Their damn dog goes "woof-woof". Woof-woof what? Woof-woof what? At full moon, the bitch howls. Piece of shit! When there's no moon, it paces around rattling its chain. Patrolling! I don't get what's with that chain! Did they have it custom-made to rattle away that loud? Can we smoke in here? No! We can argue it, but it's all pointless. That's the way the system is, Igor! The system! The election system discredited itself long ago. There's no guarantee that the elected person will do as promised. We need a different way. A different way. We need a lottery, a random choice of citizen. There's no guarantee people won't get elected just because they have a good PR manag-- Quit smoking! You're coughing your lungs up! So we don't elect the ones who can rule the country but those who want to rule! Let's go! Come on! Everything revolves around power. With lottery elections, there'd be no point controlling the media, buying votes... Snow Maiden! - Are you real? - Yes, I am. And you have a fever. Voting should take place at the end of the presidential term. If they're satisfied with the president, he retires. If they aren't, he goes to jail! The presidential term should be the sacred duty of protecting one's country. Every school kid should know that one day they may be president. To think that the majority cannot make a mistake, isn't it utopian? Democracy assumes that truth lies in the arithmetic average. But this is wrong! Do you have aspirin or paracetamol? Just a sec. Modern democracy is based on an unrealistic, hypothetical voter. Here! Take my sister, for instance. She's a nightmare, not a voter. She's completely nuts. Got knocked up and treated like dirt back in Nevyansk. Mom was paralyzed after a binge, then died. All while I was in the army. She managed to get a degree through distance learning, and fled to Australia with her son when the USSR collapsed. I still have no idea how. We keep in touch via email. She says that Australia is a Nevyansk-like continent. And she still claims there's nothing better than our birch trees. Is she the voter to aim for? Vitya! Are you nuts? This aspirin was made in 1977. Do you know what effect it has? We're about to find out. And who are you to criticize me? A doctor, perhaps? It's all the way from Nevyansk. I have stocks of it. It's worked for me, all my life! Look, I'm just... the local guardian spirit... Well, no more drinks for the guardian spirit. Read this! Holder: Artyukhin, Dmitrievich Egor, Sys... No, read the first letters only. H-A-D-E-S. Hades. You see? Hades. Hades is done. Can I have some? Yekaterinburgers were treated to a natural phenomenon today. when a vertical rainbow was visible at dawn. The columns of colored light are an optical illusion. Eye witnesses claimed it looked like the northern lights. but this phenomenon, known as a "halo", is closer to a rainbow. Suspended in the atmosphere, ice crystals create the effect... - Lights! - It's as dark as a cave. Turn it off! Your homework. - Have you done it? - Yes. - All of it? - Yes. Again? Stay right there. Or no more games for you. - Fed the turtle? - Yes. Take the bags to the kitchen. Now to the crime news. A body was found with multiple stabs... Mind the eggs! The deceased, Stepan N., 48. worked in security at School No. 2. The murder happened in the afternoon. The neighbors didn't hear or see anything. How did you discover the body? I came home from work. He was just lying there, covered in blood. My God! What's wrong with this world? People stabbed in broad daylight! Did you know the deceased? Not really. He lived alone. He was quite grumpy. Apparently he worked in security. Are all four-eyes so unimaginative? Miracles no longer exist For those who don't believe in them Even kids know the Boogeyman isn't real But fairytales live on everywhere Why don't you read a book? Those games only make you dumb. Darn it! I bought you a yogurt. How many times do I have to tell you not eat raw food, especially meat? We cook it to kill all the bacteria. You had that coming! Put it under cold water. We'll stick a band aid on when it stops bleeding. Science holds the answer to all The Snow Maiden lives in a fairytale Rockets fly towards the stars And flying carpets exist, too I'm so tired after work, and you don't give a damn! What if I'd cut deeper? We'd need an ambulance because of your stupidity! Go get a band aid. - Where are they? - The first-aid kit, where else? Where's the kit? HADES IT'S TIME TO LEAVE Where's the editorial office? This here is HADES. The editorial office is that way. I've written a work of genius. Do read it. Come back in a week. Better still, give us a call. - What? - It'd be better if you called. "The Three Graces are on the lawn, the Harpies by the deli. "The change in the ecumene is marked by M for Metro "The entrance to Hades is closer. On the last day of creation..." Excuse me. I brought my manuscript in last week. I don't remember, I'm sorry. The novel with the pink cover. I mostly work with poetry, not prose. It's about an 8 year-old girl. Dance! Let's go out and talk. What's your name? Seryozha. - You mean, Sergei? - Yes. Seryozha, Sergei... Basically, your stories are not... They have... No, they're not worth it... They are secondary. They are... Secondary means they're kind of derivative. Actually, one story... One story you wrote. The one where the heroine is talking to her classmate, right? And all of a sudden she tucks her... Skirt! She tucks her skirt into her pantyhose. After her gym class. So what was that? What did you want to say with that? Are you saying she liked that boy? Are you planning to stay with us? She liked the boy and liked talking to him and that's why she wasn't aware of... how she tucks... her skirt... - In her pantyhose. - Right. It's a very, very good story. You need more stories like that. I have another one. You have more good stories. Like the one where the mother... of the protagonist... She goes kind of... She doesn't let her husband out of the apartment. She's afraid he might take out the trash, and come back late and drunk. She knows that's what'll happen. It's also a very good and plausible story. So what shall I do? We at the magazine, and indeed the university, have a literary workshop. You should attend the meetings. But literature is so personal. Seryozha! Personal? Then why are you here? HADES IT'S TIME TO LEAVE So? What did they say? I'll become a writer anyway! And a great one at that. Where's the editorial office? - That way. - Thank you. But I'll only become famous after I die. Let's go. ALAS And our hearts are still aflame Aflame because friendship is what matters most Sorry. Our years pass by... "Attend the workshop", he said! I've never heard of great authors appearing from literary workshops. One day in Spring At the beginning of the month of May Grunting, groaning, dust, euphoria YESTERDAY I WANTED TO DIE, BUT TODAY I FEEL KINDA FINE Dimon! Dimon! Want a beer? Sure. Do you have a lot to do today? Not really. Oil change, replace the cylinders, install the drive shaft. They brought in a van making weird noises. Could be the transmission or the clutch. That'll take forever. Let's give it to Pashka. He turned it down. They're busy stripping a motor. I told the guy we'd do it, but tomorrow. I don't like working at the rear end. You're so dirty, all covered in oil. Let's go wash you. There you go. Come on. I'll wash your back. Bring it on! What the hell! Why do you even think it's about you? It's just sort of you. - How does it end? - The mechanic that "you" are in love with, is seduced by another guy. And "you" realize that... you've been deserted and that you're worthless. Why the hell am I worthless? It's not you, damn it! JESAS, RUSIA, VODKA Not you, OK? - It's a shock-novel. - Nice shock-novel. See? Whatever. Send the draft to a decent publication, they'll read it and realize what kind of an author they lost. To be honest, though... he's right, of course. I don't have enough life experience to write novels. Who needs a life like that? Hush! Come on then, Petrov, when will you help me with the suicide? How about after the weekend? I need to visit Gran in the country, to check the gas. There's nothing wrong with the gas. Come on in. Now, look here. This is a letter to a girl who used to like my poems. Here's the script, and copies. Make more copies and send them to the magazines, in 40 days' time. I can't, the Xerox is out of order. What did I do to make you hate me so much? I'm written up as a pathetic fag, you're glorified as a famous writer, loved by all. What is this crap about me being jealous? The novel isn't about you. It's not about you. OK, it's a little about you. But really it's about human wretchedness. People who can't recognize genius. You're so primitive, Petrov! You should be honored, being his prototype. People will compare the character with the real person. Being wretched scum is an honor? But we're surrounded by scum! No, seriously. You tell yourself that a mechanic is somehow... But you draw comic books, and it justifies your existence. But it doesn't. It doesn't at all. Look, you don't even realize how wretched you look. Nice one! I've never hidden my views! What shocked you, I don't get it? I'm not even trying to escape this. Because there's no way out. None! Because what's next? In a couple of years I'd have a wife, a bunch of kids. It would stink of potties, piss, and food here. I'd have to schlepp to a country house. Meet the wife's family. What else? A wedding with its stupid traditions and drunken guests. The registry office, with that woman reciting all those pompous cliches. Snotty-nosed kids with diarrhea! See, I know for sure that with that kind of burden, I'd quit writing. Quit and turn into my moronic father. An asshole drinking in secret, demanding fresh bread every day. And who cares that I have to spend an eternity in line? Even as a kid I was fucking sick of queuing with old hags screeching, "No more than two loaves per person!" I actually have work tomorrow. I get it's important for you to speak your mind. But give me a break! Are you gonna die or not? Yeah, sure, I am. Just wanted to tie up some loose ends. Explain myself. You're the procrastinator. You're scared. Of course. I'm just a dumb bastard, like everyone else. That's why your lofty goals scare me. Because your death would be pointless. Both your life and death are pointless. And my suicide is the proof that I'm right. Got it? I got it. Let's go, then. So... Here. Look. My suicide notes. The basic one. This one's "Nobody's to blame" and... I wrote several. Here, explanations for my parents and everyone else. Don't really need a note. They'll all be impressed, for sure. There's a lot here for my mother. - Why drag her into it? - Because. She married that asshole. Put up with him. Yet he constantly oppressed me! I also explain where I got the gun. - Where? - My father's stash. Back when he was in the army, he used to convoy prisoners. He stole a gun when he got discharged... and a magazine. TODAY'S SHITTY AND SO ARE YOU So what do I have to do? Just press my finger. Piece of cake, as usual. Are you sure? "Is that your final answer?" Do it. Couldn't believe my eyes. Never seen anything like it. And then I look up, and there he is, walking off! Are you guys drunk? No, sober. I don't drink. I opened the coffin but it was empty. No one in there. I've worked here ten years, and never saw a dead man walk away... I guess I'll sleep over at Grandma's. I'm beginning to feel sick too. I don't want to kill you guys... I mean, by spreading it. Done your homework? Let's see your progress report. Couldn't you wait till the New Year? Take sick leave, of course. I don't want to be sick over the holidays thanks to you! Stay home with the flu. - Is your son sick? - Not yet. So he's next, and you'll take more sick leave. He's old enough to stay home alone. Fine, stay in bed. One time, in spring At the beginning of May Grunting, groaning Dust and euphoria The trams traveled the streets Going somewhere to die Up ahead, engines roar As cars fly along Dirty, stinking cars The trees cried SCREW IT And wailed As the tires roared flicking up shit Special knives are a con. Sure, you can cut trees or chop wood with them. But to whack someone, you don't need nothing special. You don't need knives or guns, or any of that crap. Just keep a screwdriver on you. Just a couple stabs in the kisser. Fares, please! No need for 10 stabs to the heart and stomach. That's obviously the work of a psycho, or a chick. Couple times is enough. Fares, please! Don't just sit there! If you can't pay, get off at the next stop, got it? Drunk bum. Fares, please! Two tickets, please. Why did you just shove those tickets at me so rudely? What on earth was that? Guess you haven't gotten any in a while! Neither with the opposite sex, nor with your own? Maybe you've never gotten any? What? Take a look at that whore of yours! Hasn't lover-boy here got enough for a taxi? I hope he can at least afford rubbers! Or else you'll bring your little bastards on my bus. You rude cow! Kolya, stop the bus! Kolya, I said stop the bus! I can't fucking stop here! We won't get off! We paid the fare. Why should we get off? Here. These young men will get you off! What's it got to do with us? Kolya, stop! Everyone off, the bus terminates here. Then we want a refund! Suck it! Gena, don't you mess with her! What the frick! Get on with it! It's not exactly summer! Bunch of fuckers! Good, done. Here, take your change. You do know these are for passengers with children? Has everybody paid the fare? Do you even know the feeling of shame? Don't you see, my son is the future of humanity? The planet's last hope? His chakra is open. And he has a blue aura. Most people, like you, have a white aura. But his aura is blue. He can already read, write, count to 1000, and backwards. Knows some German and English. He was diagnosed with a heart defect, but it's a lie. They do it on purpose. An old village woman cured him ages ago. He won the first prize in a kids' literature competition, but the jury was bribed. They said I wrote the poem. But I don't write poems, you see? You look sick. Sit down. Has everyone paid the fare? He can heal people, and predict the future. Are you in pain? He can heal you. I got abducted by aliens when I was pregnant. They say they're gray, but in fact they're blue, like this bus. He was also abducted several times. You see, I told you. Hey, Kolya! We have some fare jumpers here. Enough of that. Breathe normally. You won't be going to school, anyway. Another breath. Everyone's getting fevers. It's no surprise during a flu outbreak. What can we do to ease the fever? Isn't it abnormal that it's so high all day? Getting sick is abnormal. EXIT TO REALITY! Try placing a cold compress on his forehead. We can't just keep giving him meds. Is he sick? Go to your room. Go on, last thing you need's a draft. Is that clear? It's not our first sickness. Everybody knows so much these days, reading up on the internet. Some still feed their kids cheap aspirin, though there's plenty of good medicines that kids love. This granny recently used rubbing alcohol on a child's skin. Resulted in alcoholic intoxication. Careful, you'll break it! This is ridiculous. So don't go listening to grannies in the family. We don't have any. Wow, you stink. Been drinking and sleeping in a morgue? Well, almost. It's kinda silly... Igor... Oh, Igor again? Is he even a real person? Or is he your imaginary friend? That's my coat washing. No whites in there? Or it'll end up like the last time. You should have thrown that awful coat away. It loses color every wash, and takes ages to dry. It looks good on me. It might look good, but it's no good. It's too thin, it's like wearing a sweater. I guess you're not hungry. No. I'll feed off my meds. We used to have this regular guy. Ordinary, nondescript type. First, he read all the works of de Sade, then everything on concentration camps, and I wondered what next. Guess what? He comes back and asks for a book... on gynecology. So? He could have his reasons. I ran into him in a book store and saw him leafing through an illustrated Kama Sutra. So if women started disappearing, we could be sure he was the psycho. So what about him? He got killed. I saw it on the news, can you imagine? He worked in security. I told you to be careful! Dad, have you finished that comic book about a boy who was abducted by aliens? No, I haven't. Will you go to sleep? Go on, bed, now! Would you look at that face, Petrov! Come on, quick! Big cities Built to last You took daddy's books again. Won't he get mad? Come on. Look! Look at this guy, on his rocket. Do you like it? Haven't drowned, I hope? Don't whistle, it's bad luck. Only those with no ear for music shouldn't whistle indoors. That's why you shouldn't whistle. Open your mouth. What're you doing? I'm reminded that happiness exists I know it's time the garden blossomed "Life gives us new challenges that require intensive study." Put them on right. We'll manage without you. Like a ballet dancer. On your head. - It's itchy. - It's a good top. It's not itchy, don't be a baby! Looks like a hockey jersey. It won't feel itchy outside when it's cold. Again! Right, enough of that. Go put your stuff away. Sail away, my friend, sail away Go, my friend, go Give me your hand. Won't you guys be late? No, we won't. Stand up straight. Give me your foot. You'll break the zip. Let me. Easy. - Let me. - OK, but don't break it again! - When did I ever? - That time! Are you taking Prince Charming to the ball? Yeah... Wait, did you bring a costume? - We didn't. - All damn night sewing sequins on her dress. Seryozha! The ships sail away Further and further from land To move freely Up against the sky As they travel the sea I'm reminded that happiness exists I know it's time the garden blossomed But where are the people The thousands of weapons They're terrifying to count I got hold of some green bananas. I've left them to ripen. My husband ate three when I wasn't looking! He got gas canisters to make soda. Seryozha will love it with berry juice. That's interesting nail polish. I bought it on vacation last summer, from Gypsies. - Unusual. - Do you like my hair? I saw that Brylska woman with it, in my calendar. I watched Autumn Marathon with Leonov and a real foreign actor. I heard about it on Kinopanorama. How did you get your vacation? I got a voucher from the trade union. Lovely resort with mud baths. - Mud baths are disgusting. - I just loved it. He needs onion juice and hot milk. The New Year party! Forget the damn party! You wanna go wrapped in a blanket? But I wanna go! Even if the fever subsides, you're not allowed. It might make things worse. Don't cry. I'll take you if your fever drops. What if it doesn't? Finish my costume anyway, I'll wear it to the school party. Don't rush me, there's time. First there is, then there isn't, then you're busy. Stop whining! This is all your fault! Let me. Is it true that when a murderer dies, the ghosts of everyone he killed gather at his bed? Who told you that nonsense? Grandma. Enough of that. No idea. I haven't killed anyone, and haven't died yet, either. So I haven't been able to check it. It's all tall tales. Even if they do, so what? Will they sue him? 103.1 F! - Am I better? - You are! - Call an ambulance? - No, not the hospital! Nobody is going to hospital! Hello, what's your emergency? So look, our kid has quite a fever. Could you come over? We send a crew in case of emergency only. Well, it's kinda serious. The kid's fever is over 103 degrees. He doesn't feel very well. I also have quite a fever, and don't feel very well. What caused the fever? The flu? What else could have caused it? Number of reasons, like sepsis, for instance. - Sure it's the flu? - I guess so. Is he conscious? Yes. Any seizures, diarrhea, or vomit? Guess not. What do you mean "you guess"? Don't you look after him? Where even are you? How can you not know if he's had seizures or diarrhea? Look, "I guess" is just a way of speaking. He hasn't had diarrhea, vomiting, or seizures. So don't call us unless it happens. They'll float to the top in half an hour. What about aspirin instead of paracetamol? You're not meant to give it to kids. Though aspirin was OK when I was a kid. No harm done, I guess. We don't have any aspirin. I can go to the pharmacy. We all know how that'll end. You'll be gone 2 hours, or maybe even 2 days. You can go, then. Aren't you worried about me going alone at night? Let's go together. What if something happens to him? So, what do you suggest? I found a pill in your pocket while I was doing laundry, was it aspirin? Guess so. Where did I put it? Maybe in here... It is aspirin, but it's ancient. It's probably as old as me. Like, it's from the '70s. You had one yesterday, you're OK. It was the day before yesterday. And I had a lot of stuff that day, like tea. aspirin, there might have been some vodka. It might have neutralized the aspirin. Let's give it to him and see. Then we can decide about the pharmacy. Where did I put it? I was cooking when you called, so I had to rush off. I shoved it in my purse. Why did you send him to me mid-week? The library was going to have a New Year party, but it got canceled. I'd already sent him here, so I decided to stay home. Worked out a treat, huh? Look, if you're getting some, say so. Whatever. Well of course, I put it here. Where else... Come on. Wow, it's still so high. Shit, he's hot. Hey, buddy, wake up, come on! Can you hear me? Wake up! Can you hear me? Hold on! I said hold on! Hey, watch out! There are pedestrians here! Get lost, asshole! You hear me? Get moving! What the...? Help! Help! Can you hear me? Give me your hand. Come on. Wait for me here, OK? Look at that snowflake. Look at her! She's gorgeous! Ready, cosmonaut? Look after the little boy, now. His eyelashes are really long. Even longer than mine. Parents of little rabbits, please... Let's try in there. Why do the dogs upset you? Will you be extending the call? I don't think so. I've had enough... Hello, maybe you know where we can find a costume? Don't know. I don't work here. Don't worry, Mom, I'll be fine. You're so rude. Who can I ask about costumes? What costumes? I don't work here. For a chat on the phone, you do work here, but when I ask for help, turns out you don't. I want to see your boss! It's his day off. So who's in charge? The lover-boy who hired you here? Try the secretary or the deputy director, 2nd floor. Got it. Seryozha! Come on, let's go! That cow! Be gone! Leave us alone! Well, well, who've we got here? It's a hockey player! Hello! Come here! Looks like you've lost your helmet! Did you lose it fighting with the Canadians? For the smallest kid, the biggest present! There you are! Now, off you go. Say thank you! Oh no, it's fallen apart! All together, let's summon her! Snow Maiden! Snow Maiden! Where have you been all this time, Snow Maiden? Hello, dear Grandfather Frost! One, two, three... Let's light up the tree! I guess someone didn't chant. Without you, light up it can't! Hey you, hockey player without a helmet. Let's light the tree up. Say it. Come on, say it! So? Say it. Let's light up the tree... Vasya, turn it on. Shine, magic celebratory lights! Look how big it is! What's so special about this year? You're a bit hot. Are you real? Yes, I am real. You have a fever. We thank the Party for our new schools and parks! Thank you for the great party, too! Seryozha, give him a wave! - You are sick! - Don't care! - It'll get worse! - It won't! Pull these tricks on your dad, it won't work with me! Yes, it will! No! I don't want you to end up with pneumonia! I won't! I'll send you to hospital. You'll spend New Year there! Do you hear me? You brat. You hate me! I'll go live with dad! What? You think daddy's the good one? And I'm bad? - Yes, you are! - Oh, I see. Because I don't let you harm yourself, or do whatever you want, it means I'm bad. Great, got it! Glad we cleared that up. You're still not going anywhere. I am! - No, you're not! - Yes, I am! You're not. - I won't let you go. - I will go! No, you won't. Listen here, you're not going anywhere, no matter what your beloved daddy does. Are you seriously taking him? Stop it. At least take his temperature. We'll get him in the car and go. What's the problem? It's not like waiting for the bus. He won't inhale any cold air. But he'll infect the others! Probably won't, I guess. His fever's gone, look. Just sort of dropped away. I'm so sick of you both! We're gonna be late. Hurry up! Come on, we're gonna be late! Don't worry, we'll get there. Sure we will. We should've left earlier. Screw the coat check. Just take your stuff off here. I'll wait for you here. Or should I wait in the car? It takes ages to get out, especially if you lose your ticket. Got your phone? Want me to go with you? Make sure they're nice to you. Your phone! Shall I go with you or wait in the car? What would you prefer? Are you alright? I guess so. Why? Something up? He forgot to take his sneakers. Is he wearing his boots indoors? I don't recall him taking his sneakers. Or is he in his gym slippers? It's way too cold for them! He put his sneakers in his coat pockets. Did you feel his forehead? Has his fever gone up? He was OK, I guess. He was looking fine. He's unavailable. He must have turned his phone off. I guess they were all told to. - It's theater after all. - Fine. Whatever. That suit of yours won't fool me. My husband wears them, too. He's all serious for his staff, but really he's just a kid. Pathetic, isn't it? I mean, he disappears during the day. He could just say he's seeing someone else... Just try telling a wife that! No, really, it's all I ask. Like hell! Come on, I get it. He's 45 already, can't be easy. 45 is a great age. He's still young. He's full of pathetic excuses, you know? What's worse, he doesn't even try to hide that he loves another, who's waiting for him down under. You mean she's dead? As good as. In Australia. - What about Australia? - She lives there. I wish I lived there. You men are like little boys. Instead of telling me the truth, you peddle made-up stories. What's the point in the truth? When I do tell it, I get an earful. Well-deserved. Mine's the same. He just makes up stupid lies. One time he claimed he was drinking with the cops for 2 days. It happens. Just now he claims they drove around in a hearse with a corpse in it. What? Says he bumped into an old friend, they got a ride in a hearse, and drank all night. - With the corpse? - Oh, nobody missed it. - How come? - They just didn't. He says... his friend got drunk and blacked out, so they wanted to swap bodies, so his friend would wake up in the coffin and get scared as f... - Cool. - There he is! That was fast! Off you go, and forget the funny story. ...the truly cold, who does not yet know what true faith is, always hopes to acquire it, but one warmed by it through baptism, who then, through laziness, went cold... What's with you? You get upset? You upset us, leaving like that. You were wrong to leave without saying goodbye. What? My wife been telling you about me? Have you met her? She's pissed with me. But apart from me, who else wants her? Her daughter isn't mine. Who else would want a deserted woman? I used to have a woman who loved me. But she left. She didn't want to ruin my life. This one doesn't love me, yet still lives with me. You humans are so complicated. - And you're what, an alien? - Yeah. I'm sterile. I mean, not 100% sterile. I've a one-in-a-million chance of getting a woman pregnant. Doctors... can't help. And then... I finally managed to get a woman pregnant. But it was the wrong one. I know. Your wife said you're in love with another. And you don't try to hide it. Did she? She goes into that much detail with strangers? It's easier with strangers. You're boring. Gimme the pillow. What for? We'll smother him. Then what? Then we'll throw him out. Wait, someone's calling. Hello? You asshole! Where did you drive off to? I told you to come here. Get him in there. There we go. You know what? We should put him into the coffin. Why? It'll give him a kickstart in the morning, when he wakes up from the cold. Fuck that. Too much fuss. Enough! Victor Mikhailovich! Otherwise he'll puke and choke on his own vomit. It happens often. Enough! Wait... Where do you think you're going? Let's get him in the front. Let go! Let fuckin' go! Put him in the front. I'll do anything for a good guy, see? As long as he lives. Wait! Buckled him up? Yes. Fuck it... Where's the body? Where the fuck is the body? Where is it? Shit! Shitting hell! I went to a New Year's party once... and the Snow Maiden took my hand. Her hand was really cold. As if she were a real Snow Maiden. What do you want? I can't... What can't you? You can't just be a grown up? Just act like a grown up, that's it! Go on! Go wash your hair, and enough of the drama! What are you talking about? I've had it up to here with you! I look at you And I lose myself Oh, wonderful life I dreamt of you once before So come back to my dreams again Young, our flame is blue We sweat and burn above the water You spit through your teeth Disfigured, you rest, content Oh, wonderful life Teach me to burn brighter You'll tear my head from my shoulders You'll burn me alive on the spot Oh, wonderful life I have something to tell you But better still, teach me to be quiet Good evening. Aren't you cold? Was belting out serenades to you And you, looking out from above With a Gioconda smile I'm Yura. Romeo in love A shaggy-haired good-looker Is peeping so devotedly Through rowan berry clusters While a blue trolleybus Quietly honks its horn The last one. come at random Just like in Okudzhava's song Oh, blue trolleybus! Take me to space Good evening. Before it's too late Blue trolleybus Before it's too late Take all of us to space Romeo with his messy hair Is standing under the balcony While poets are passing by like shadows And the blue trolleybus Jumps along joyfully And the blue trolleybus Takes them to space Orchestras play, heroes leave, While underwear and pantyhose Are thrown into the air Belonging to some Excited red-headed girl Who dreams at night Of meeting a dolphin HOW DO WE LIVE ON? Blue trolleybus Take me to space Before it's too late Take all of us to space Thank you. Well? Another one? "Remember this moment. "Remember the wild rose bush. "Remember the mark it left on your shoulder. "I will forever be your poet. "And I'll forever be your lover! And... nothing else." You're scaring people. Do you like Asadov's poetry? Not really. Then you don't know him. "Now this noisy, hot day is over "The boulevard is unusually quiet "And I can see the full moon hover "In the sky like a giant lost kite "All "the windows and doors "are ajar "Someone's strumming a guitar "A yellow carpet appears on the road "At the bright flash of a street lamp flicking on "A girl flees from the light "Disappearing into the night "And all that she left behind echoing in the summer air "Were her joyous cries of... Yes!" You're quite the actor. Where did you say you're from? Nevyansk. I see. It's a small town. I see. Do your parents live there? Only my mother. And my brother. I see. So, what does your mother do? She's a cleaner. She is very much like you. I see. So, what's the plan? We were going to the movies. I meant your life plan. Sasha and I will get married. Is bread not on the menu? And then we'll move back to Nevyansk. Right, Sasha? He'll run an acting class. I could teach English to kids. I see. Got it? What was that about Nevyansk? You suggest we stay here? Your mom will eat me alive. But there, you'll be treated like a king. Because you're an actor, you don't drink or smoke. You don't know my mom. She's the purest, kindest person I know. I'm sure you'll get along. I don't want anyone telling me how to treat my husband, or how to raise my child. - Sasha! - Yes, Mom? Come here. I'm coming. Every young athlete owes his success to the pros, take weight lifters... Yes, I'm fine with that. Shall I turn it down? Alright. See you tomorrow. - Strange... - Your fiancé? No, someone looking for an English tutor for a kid. Do you need a sweater? I have one. Did they specifically ask for me? Yes. He asked for Marina from Room 405. Sounds weird. It could be a psycho, be careful. Be very careful! Irina Vitalievna. Have you heard? People get stabbed in parks, strangled in elevators... Irina Vitalievna! Can I make a call, please? No, you can't! - Please. - No. This isn't a damned phone booth! Get out of here! Do you have any idea how he got the dorm phone number? It's fishy. - Why can she use it and not me? - Because! This is the workers' quarters. Good job, Igor. I didn't expect you to be such a fast learner. And your parents live here, too? Yes. You can tell them I appreciate the determination and diligence. What, theirs? No, yours. Sorry, I got distracted. My brother is 17 too, but you look way older than him. He doesn't even shave yet, but look at your stubble. It runs in the family. You look like an adult. Igor... Igor... - Can I come inside you? - Sure. Hello. - The dancers will be here shortly. - Got it. After graduation I'll stage The Seagull. Lordy, nobody'll let you. You'll do a piece on steelworkers. I have an incredible insight... Gera! - Hello. - Jell-O! Kids won't believe this joke of an axe. What am I meant to... We'll work it out. There is nothing complicated about this role. There's nothing Hamlet-like or Seagully in it. You make your entrance, say a couple of lines. I'll write them down, we'll practice. Just smile and that's it. I don't much like children. They'll figure out that I'm a fake Snow Maiden. Well, I don't like them myself. All they want is candy and presents. Just get them to ask for the Christmas tree to light up. I'll do the rest. Alright? Alright. Well, let's begin! We have a new Snow Maiden. Enough smoking. Let's get to it. We'll start with me, Grandfather Frost, my entrance. Here I am! Hello... Come on, everyone! Sasha, where is my costume? Give me my staff. Where's my costume? Put it all where it belongs. It's unprofessional. I'm Gera, the Snowman. But I have no costume. That's one shitty snowman! Bastards didn't even make me one. I'm the bear, Georgiy. Chill, bro. Come on. There's meant to be a log hut, a magic TV, a tree. All this here will be in the hall. Natalya is the witch. She made a stupid joke about Jews. Not funny! They didn't let her use the hut in rehearsal, there's some dance class after us. No artistic talent at all! - Natalya Dmitrievna. - What, Gera? You'll die before marriage! Let's go. Hello there, our laden Snow Maiden. My god, is she mute, too? Then our secrets are safe. Come bone some herring. Gera, my axe! They can go do correction work! That's right! Come on, bear, join us! Take the witch with you! And here is my granddaughter! Snow Maiden! I'm Snow Maiden. My granddaughter! Hello, kiddies! Oh, magic celebratory lights, shine! Bye. Sorry. So what are you going to do? I don't know. Abortion, I guess. Why don't you keep it? Oh, no... He and I are very different. And his parents are weird. His mother's just like mine. Forever saying "I see". Hello. Can I get the key to Room 16, please? - Here you are! - Thank you. They might like a grandchild. Not from this "provincial". My family won't be happy either. My mother says that children are for your old age. To take care of us? Take care of myself, thanks. Door! You are so gorgeous! Oh, those dark eyebrows. You can go, sweetie! - Dang it, Snowflakes! - Oh, here we go... Get away from my bag. Now! I said move! - Natalya Dmitrievna. - What? Damn it! How am I to work with the kids, if they eat all the candy? They are children too, Sasha! They're mares! The higher-ups don't like how the snowflakes look like prostitutes. They aren't snowflakes, they're a snowstorm. Should've locked your bag in a safe in your private dressing room, instead of leaving it lying around. The bear had a rummage, too. Don't drag me into it. We'll need something tasty to have with this port after the party. Sasha's quite the asshole, I mean, honestly! His own dressing room to "get into the role"! We know what he gets into. Well, the boss is his aunt. Sasha! What? I need to tell you something. What? It's just between the two of us. Stay here! I don't want you to get me wrong. I don't know how to tell you... It's very serious. I know you won't say no. Give me the key so I can call Mom long distance. Here you go. But don't talk long, or my aunt will kill me. I see. Hello. Long distance call, please. What can I say? It is what it is, nothing you can do about it. I'm cleaning the town hall today. Sunday's off 'cause of a New Year party. They've got all those... - Marina, can you you hear me? - Yes, I can. All those paper streamers, crackers. Bucket loads to clear up! And then there's all that snow. How am I to... Mom, how's Victor? Rude is what he is. I asked him nicely yesterday to get me a painkiller for my headache. He took six rubles and bought aspirin. Just out of spite. Six rubles of it, Marina! But I just don't get how they could sell so much to a teenager! Is there no control on what they sell? What if he wanted to harm himself in some way? He really got 6 rubles' worth? Yes! Six rubles! You can live off that kind of money! You'll have enough aspirin for a lifetime. Mom, I wanted to... Quite enough for my lifetime, I won't last long with children like these. Mom, what's wrong? Our idiotic neighbors have got dogs. There isn't enough food for people. They should have adopted an orphan! Why do the dogs upset you? I can't sleep because of them. They howl endlessly... Do you know how early I get up? Do you know? Marina, can you hear me? They keep telling me I'm a bad cleaner, that I look terrible, I'm no good at work, or this or that, it's all my fault. Whatever it is, it's my fault! The neighbors and their dogs blame me, my kids and my bosses blame me. They say they're about to fire me. About to fire me! They can't flipping fire a single mother! Will you be extending the call? I don't think so. I've had enough. Hello, maybe you know where we can find a costume? Don't know. I don't work here. Don't worry, Mom, I'll be fine. It'll be better once he goes to college. He'll leave me, just like you. He'll leave me. Just like you! Mom... You're so rude. Who can I ask about costumes? I don't know. I don't work here. For a chat on the phone, you do work here, but when I ask for help, turns out you don't. I want to see your boss! It's his day off. So who's in charge? The lover-boy who hired you here? Try the secretary or the deputy director, 2nd floor. Got it. Seryozha! Come on. Let's go. That cow! Mom, not you. Mom? Hello? Snow Maiden! Marina, come on. There she is, my dear granddaughter! Snow Maiden! Where have you been all this time, Snow Maiden? Hello, Grandfather Frost. Hello! Let's hold hands, little snowflakes. And light up the tree! Let's form a magic circle... One, two, three! Let's light up the Christmas tree! Why doesn't it light up? It's because you need to say the magic words to Grandfather Frost! Thank you! You're welcome. One, two, three! Let's light up the tree! Oh no, it's not working! I guess someone didn't chant. Without you, light up it can't! Speak up, hockey player without a helmet! Let's light the tree up. Say it. Come on, say it! Let's light up the tree. Well... Vasya, turn it on. Shine, oh magic celebratory lights! So, children... You're a bit hot. What important event will our elder brothers and sisters celebrate this year? Let's dance in a circle, come on. Correct! Hear that, Granddaughter? The anniversary of the revolution. 60 years of Soviet rule. What? Are you real? Yes, I am. You have a fever. And when is Pioneers' Day? The 19th of May! Good job, children! Everyone gets an A+! And tell me, Granddaughter, what else can we do to make this celebration even better? Well, for that, we have... We have to perform our fina... The clock on the Kremlin tower The clock on the Kremlin tower Has slowed right down The New Year will continue And the old year will pass on The New Year will continue its magical count down Let's see our kids smile And welcome the coming year Oh, Christmas tree, shine brightly! We thank the Party for our new schools and parks! An abortion... Screw this, I'm getting an abortion. Thank you for the fruits of autumn For the morning alarm bell For the smoke from our camp fires For the good grades we got this winter We salute the outgoing year And welcome the New Year! Happy New Year! Be happy in the New Year! Strange event right here in town, at New Year. A horror story with a happy ending. First, the grieving family lost the dead body. then the deceased returned home, in rude health. Well, he was in the coffin, like a dead man should be. But then I saw the coffin was open. And it was empty. I couldn't believe my *** eyes. In 10 years working here, I've never seen a dead man get up. So I get out, and see him *** walking to the bus stop. And I'm like, "Oi, ya bastard, get back in!" But he's like, "No, I'm going home." "You're *** not!" He's like, "But it's New Year!" First, Nikolay and I thought it was a joke. When we realized the deceased had actually come back to life. we took him home, because he refused to get into the hearse. It's true. In an underground pod hotel A wailing ripens in a ruined mouth As if somewhere a window's crying That's my forebear turning over A gray steam writhes above a tomb A corpse sits on his heels Feeling out of sorts Shake the sleep out of unused muscles Run like a mouse from the graveyard At dawn, to the dragonfly march In a hunchbacked sky the stars like goosebumps Blow on your hands, pray in the dark Get close to the window Hitch a ride in a stinking car A corpse's heart beats in the twilight The sweat's so thick you can spread it on bread Glands twist out black mince A worm-ridden heart Sings its revenge Veins swell in a phantom dick it stiffens, ready for action Like a burp of sealing foam Balls droop over the headboard Dropping in drips, Other people's thighs Scoffing, downing glasses Lie, fool around, smash dishes That is, screw this life like a bitch Fall takes off its rotten wig The sunsetting sun chews on cured meat The city's rolled up in a ball like a cat And disappeared with some swindlers My daughter sleeps A piece of me Chewing on her mother's warm nipple Drinking buddies yell outside A finger harasses the doorbell Click goes the lock Corpse on your doorstep The speckled cosmos hangs above The corpse on your doorstep's welcome Lumps of sugar swirl in a cup The black soils will froth up The corpse will replace me everywhere The corpse will screw my wife Snort coke, smoke weed It'll lose its mind in empty hotels Force out words in a boiler room club Dance, throwing around scraps of phrases The maggots in the corpse eyes stare The crowd swarms like woodlice Chunks of skin peel off the face Teeth like the keys of a piano Groups of corpses in condemned buildings Make a plan, split the loot This party of the dead marches in time A parliamentarian gets wet in a pit The army of the dead sings terror Corpses run street checkpoints The corpses smooch in the windows In an underground pod hotel A wailing ripens in a ruined mouth The last coffin opens its mouth wide The last corpse leaves its coffin Icons of corpses on dashboards Corpse porn in 3D glasses Their children hang out at the mall Shadow of a corpse across your face Fares, please!
