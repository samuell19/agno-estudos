Are you sure you are okay? I am Mara Villanueva Castro. Thirty-five years old. Filipino. Single? Married? I am married to a lunatic. Lunatic. Crazy. Insane. Deranged, mad, unhinged, got a screw loose, not in his right mind, a maniac. Sorry. I'm really sorry. I'm in a hurry. Giorgi. - Joachim, how are you? - Good. Everything okay here? We have a little problem but that's normal so we'll sort it out. Jean Pierre wanted to give you this. You know I love the wines from your vineyard. May I? Sure. It was supposed to be two bottles but the other one broke on the way here. Why, what happened? Mara, can you bring us some bread? Yes, Giorgi. Coming. Hey, I want you to meet Mara. Our new staff. And she's from the Philippines, too. Thank you, Mara. This is Joachim. Joachim, this is Mara. How are you, Mara? So you're also Filipino. Hi. So, what happened to the other bottle? Nothing. I was clumsy. I dropped it on the way here. No worries. Things happen. Excuse me. - I have to go back to the kitchen. - Sure Mara. Thank you. To unexpected moments and expected consequences. - Cheers! - Yes. Joachim. From the restaurant. Giorgi's friend. - You broke my wine bottle-- - Yes, I remember. Why are you here? You dropped this. Thank you. I live on the fifth floor. Small world. You broke my wine bottle exactly when I was heading to your workplace, and you happen to live here. I'm really sorry... about the wine. That's fine. There's a lot of wine here. I'll replace your bottle. I have one inside. No need. Please. I feel guilty. Make me a coffee instead. When I let him into my house, I also let him into my life. What is it? You don't do this back home? So... how long have you been here? In this apartment or in Georgia? Both. Five years in Georgia. In this apartment, a year. You've been here for three months? How did you know? Giorgi. Right. Have you been around? Not much. I started work as soon as I got here, so I haven't been to a lot of places. Want me to take you around? Huh? Are you afraid of me? No. Why? Should I be scared? I like your hair. Why do I like you? Who are you? Do you still go home to the Philippines? Rarely. What do you do here? I have a business. What kind? Drugs. Kidding. Wine. Seriously, you make wine? Do you own a vineyard? Ten years ago, I lived in the US. I met Georgian guys who were also into wine. So... after five years in the US, they convinced me to move here. They hired me. Now, I have a share in the business here. All's well. So far, so good, my lady. This is such a beautiful place. Are there Filipinos here? Just a few. There used to be 50 of us. Now there are around 30. That few? Do you know all of them? I met them once, but I don't really socialize. Why? I just avoid that sort of thing. Filipinos? Socializing. Not just with Filipinos. Kartlis Deda, the Mother of Georgia. On her left hand is a bowl of grapes to welcome friends upon their arrival. On her right, she holds a sword in case she must confront enemies. Nice. What then? Grapes or sword? Huh? Do you welcome me with grapes or a sword? My lady, what's your story? Just trying out my luck here. What you earn here, you can easily earn in the Philippines. Why choose to work in Georgia? No particular reason, just-- Where are your parents? Siblings? Which part of the Philippines are you from? And why is your hair red? You don't have to answer all of my questions. Why ask then? So you'll know I'm not interested in all of your answers. If you don't answer, it's fine. I'm single. Are you? Yes? "Yes"? Yes. What now? Grapes or sword? Grapes? "Grapes?" Or "Grapes." With a question mark or a period? Grapes. Period. Got you! So many questions. I don’t understand, but he draws me closer. He draws me closer to him. Two shots of chacha, please. Chacha dances on your throat. It's strong. No one refuses a drink in Georgia. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Sopo and Misho, who will perform a Kartuli dance accompanied by our musicians. Do you know this dance? The man stares at the woman. He stares at her like she's the only woman in the world. And the woman never looks at the man. She keeps her head down throughout the dance. What does that mean? It means... that, even in love, a man's respect for the woman remains great. The man's body won't touch the woman, though he's close to her. Have you been tied up? I'll tie you up. Stop it. You can take it. Now, I love you. So, what happened next? We fell in love. I quit a long time ago. Never say die, don't quit. But if I don't quit, I will die. You want to die? Sometimes. You've seriously thought about it? Well, I don't smoke that often. Happy one month! What? We have been together for a month. Do we still need validation? Not really. It just feels so fast. Do we need to slow down? We're not kids. We don't know much about each other. Mara, we don't build our relationship based on memories from our past. We don't need the past, right? What we have now is what matters. What we have. It's not about how long. As long as I am yours, you are mine. Two lost souls. He needed me. I needed him. We were meant for each other. That's what I knew. That's what I felt. Oh, shit! Joachim, what's wrong? We ran over a woman. Joachim, no one was there. A girl in uniform crossed the road. We ran her over! What? Joachim, calm down. There was nobody. Joachim, are you okay? Joachim. Thank you, Mara. Let's have dinner. He was different. But I still fell for him. Okay. Happy three months! What's wrong? Nothing. Feels like I've been with you for years. But there's so much we don't know about each other. What else do we need to learn about each other? Joachim, remember our one-month anniversary? When you thought you ran over a girl. You were so scared. Wouldn't you be scared if you thought you ran over someone? Did I kill anyone? Let's get married. Marriage this soon? It's only been three months. Why rush into marriage? So what? We're really into each other. Why wait? That's a bad joke. Then let me be serious. Will you? What's that? It's an imaginary ring. Then my answer is an imaginary yes. - Let's do it. - What are you talking about? Let's do it. Seriously? Let's do it. Wow, I can't believe we're actually doing this. Is this for real? This is real. Where are we going? - To the City of Love. - Huh? In Sighnaghi, we can get married any time of the day. You can't escape me anymore. You're really crazy. Sometimes, being crazy is the best feeling. Joachim, please answer. Do you take Mara as your wife, promise to love her and be faithful to her? Yes. Mara, do you take Joachim as your husband, promise to love him and be faithful to him? Yes. With this answer, you confirm once again your decision and promise that your family will be based on love and faithfulness. Good evening. Thank you for coming. I offer you the best Georgian red wine from Pheasant's Tears Winery. For my wife. What now? Already want a divorce? Maybe tomorrow. It's a bit late. What's this for? It's pretty. If you don't like the wine, you pour it there. In wine tastings, you get to try ten different types of wine. What a waste. Wine is so expensive. Why would you throw it away? Such a Filipino! Fine, let's drink everything. This is where we'll live. Why? Why not? You don't want to live in the City of Love? One of my Georgian business partners has a house here. The basement has a cellar where he stores all the homemade wine. We can get drunk every day. We don't ever have to leave. We'll just stay in bed and finish all the wine. Mara... we're married now. I'll take care of you. We're family, the two of us. Joachim. Sorry, sorry. Fuck! Joachim, just let it go. Let's leave. Why are you so clumsy? Joachim, I'm sorry. Okay? Let me. Fuck! You're so sloppy. Joachim, are you all right? Joachim. Mara, I'm sorry. It's okay. Stop. Mara, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, Mara. It's okay, Joachim. I'm so sorry. Joachim, it's okay. Joachim, stop. That's enough. Did you know wine was discovered in Georgia? He's a little different. Unpredictable. But I can see myself in him. He's very vulnerable. He needs me. We need each other. Mara, do you have any relatives? Parents, siblings? None. None? They're all dead. I'm sorry. He's my only family. He is what I call the home I've been longing for such a long time. He is my life. Joachim. You're having a nightmare. She's here. Who? She's here. I can hear her. I hear nothing, Joachim. Calm down. I will get your medicine. Joachim. Why did you do that? Did I scare you? Why are you angry? You haven't cooked. I'll cook then. What do you want? Scrambled or sunny side up? Joachim. Or bread? Or you want rice? Joachim. - I made an appointment. - I don't want to. No, this is a different therapist. Can't we try? You have to face reality. What reality? That the things you see aren't real. The girl wearing a uniform. Fuck! You're just saying that because you don't see her. She's here. She wants to scare us. Mara, please listen. Fuck! Why? Why, Joachim? What did you do to that girl? Mara! Joachim. I saw her. Who? The girl in the uniform. She's in the basement, in the wine cellar. Joachim, please stop. I will show you. She's there, Mara. You have to believe me! She's here. The girl. I chased her. I locked her in the basement. Joachim, please sit for a while. Calm down. The keys. I need to find the key so you'll believe that what I see is real. The key was here. Joachim. Do you hear that? Mara, she escaped. She got out. She got out. Fuck, she escaped. Joachim. She's here. Don't leave me, Joachim. Who are you? Help me, Joachim. Who are you? Joachim. There's nobody. Please look at me. Stop haunting me! Stop! This is Mara, your wife. I'm your wife. Mara, I don't know what to do anymore. Mara, forgive me. We went to Telavi. Stayed at the caretaker's house of Joachim and his partner's vineyard. I was hoping to... make a fresh start. But I was wrong. Last night was the worst. I tried to stop him but he was too strong. I had to hide and run away to escape from him. I don't know where he is now. Help me. I want my husband back. You want him back? But you said he is crazy. Everyone is. We all have our dark side. I want my husband back even if he kills me So, Joachim. Can you tell me something about yourself? Joachim Castro Thirty-five years old Filipino I have been living in Georgia for five years. I know that already. It's all here. Maybe you can start by telling me something about your life, that I do not know yet I am married to a lunatic. Yeah, but I think you should really change it. It tastes wonderful but I just don't- I don't know. There's just something about- I'm sorry, mister. Are you Filipino? Huh? You're Filipino. Mister, I'm really sorry. I'm in a hurry. I'll replace your wine... One day. I'm really sorry. Giorgi. - Joachim. - Hello, what's up? Hi. Hi. Look, I'm so sorry. I broke the other bottle on my way here. Oh, what happened? Someone accidently bumped into me and I dropped the wine. She said sorry though. She? Yes, "she." Was she pretty? Oh, come on, Giorgi. Listen, I'm just trying to be helpful here. The past five years you've been here, you've never dated anyone. So I'm going to hook you up this time. Okay Giorgi, thank you. But I'm not interested. I really have to go. I'll be back next week. Oh no! Before you go I want you to meet someone. She's our new staff. And she's Filipina. - Mara. - Yes? And she's so pretty and hot. Mara, I want you to meet Joachim. Long Live! You guys know each other? - No. - Yes. No? Nice to meet you. Same here. Sorry, I have to go back to the kitchen. Sure, Mara. Yeah, thank you. Isn't she hot, man? Oh my God, Giorgi. I really have to go. See you next week. All right. All right. I have them. You dropped them. Did you follow me? I live upstairs. You live here? I just moved in. I was surprised when you entered the building. Anything else? Huh? Any more questions? You ask questions like an investigator. Sorry. Want to have coffee? Huh? At my place. Or maybe your place? So we won't have to go up. My place is messy. Is that okay? It's fine? Okay. May I smoke here? I've already quit. Good for you. I'm not a quitter. I never say die. But if I don't quit, I'll die. When did you move here? Three months ago. Have you been around? When I arrived, I started work immediately. That's why I haven't been to many places. Take me around. What? Are you afraid of me? Should I be scared? I like your hair. They told me that, when your hair is red in Georgia, people ignore you. They lied. Why do you say that? It didn't work on you. You quit smoking, and you're still out of breath? I haven't been here for a while. Wow. Why did you choose Georgia? Why not? What you earn here, you can easily earn in the Philippines. No reason. Just checking out if the air is fresher here. Just want to be in a new place. Do you have friends? I like being alone. But maybe... I can have one. Are you afraid of dying? You're scared. Why not admit it? I'm not. Well, if you're scared, you're scared. If you've done something wrong, admit it. Wow. That's deep. I got your back. Two shots of chacha please. What is it? Want to get drunk? That's strong. Ever been tied up? Huh? Stop pretending. I will tie you up. Mara, stop! You're strangling me! Now, I love you. So Joachim, about this bondage or rope tying... Have you done this before? We fell in love. I told you I didn't want to. Stop fooling around. Fine, let me take a drag. There. I thought you said... "You'll die if you don't quit." You want to die? Sometimes. Seriously? Sometimes? You've thought about it? I only smoke sometimes. Oh! You'll get us into an accident. Happy anniversary. What is it? We've been together for a month. It's like... it happened so fast. Hey! Know what? It doesn't matter how long. What matters is that I'm yours... and you are mine. We ran over a girl! - Check on her! - Hold on. I will. Just a second. Calm down. Just breathe. Calm down. Okay? Just wait. Are you all right? Huh? Are you crying? How about you? Are you okay? Why? What happened? Mara. You kept screaming, "We ran over a girl!" Did we? No. What's the problem? Let's go. I'm hungry. Happy three months! Do you ever forget anything? Never, especially not those who owe me. What do I owe you? I will marry you. I will marry you. Will you marry me? Yes. - But it seems-- - You don't want to? Of course, I do. Then let's get married. Let's go to Sighnaghi. Are you crazy? That moment when you're crazy, you have to seize it. What is it? She's here. She's here. Mara, you're having nightmares again. Joachim, she's here. She's here Joachim. Help. She's here! Calm down. Help me! Calm down. I'll get your medicine. Why did you do that, Mara? Why are you mad? It's still early. What is this? You didn't cook? Pears, are you kidding me? What is it? Joachim, what happened this time? What is it? Nothing. Joachim, you need a checkup. If you don't like that therapist, we can look for another one. Join me? Huh? Let's get checked together. Jerk! You're the one with a problem, not me! Please help my wife. She's getting worse everyday. She's seeing things that are not there. Doctor, I don't want to lose her. She's my life. Okay, Joachim. Don't worry. We will fix everything. I'm sorry, I have to go. My wife is waiting for me outside. I will schedule another appointment for you this week. Also, please don't forget to take your medicine. It will help you calm down. Okay, Doctor. Hi. Have you seen my wife? She had an appointment before me. She was just sitting right there. I'm sorry, I did not see her leave. Okay. Thank you. Mara. Mara! Mara! Mara. Does it suit me? Mara, hold on. Mara. Have you eaten? I cooked. Mara, hold on. Joachim, you should eat. Mara, sit down. Please. Did you take your medicine? Joachim. Mara. Mara, please. I am not Mara! Joachim. Joachim, she's here. Can you hear her? Joachim, she's here. Who are you? Mara. Can you hear her? Who are you? Who are you? I don't know you! Leave me alone! - Joachim, she's here. - Mara, hold on. - She is here. - Mara. Mara. Who are you? Mara! Where are you? Show yourself! Who are you? Leave! Who are you? You know me. I am Ana, and I am a lunatic. I'm drinking alone now? - I've had too much to drink. - A little more. We have to finish this. You didn't drink. Sir, you're getting me drunk. Can I tie you up again? You're making a habit of it. Come on. I don't want to. But I love you. Let's do it. What are you doing? It's fine. Don't take a video of me. Don't. One. Sorry, sorry. Watch it. Joachim. Ana? Mara. Look at Ana. Isn't that Ana? She's a slut. What happened to her? She wasted her scholarship. There she is. Keep quiet. Mara! Mara! Mara! Isn't she the one they're watching? What are you projecting? Class, what are you watching? Ana... Mara! Mara! Mara! Mara! Mara! I'm so exhausted. Who is she? Why is she messing with us? You should rest. Tomorrow, we're going to Telavi. To our vineyard. We'll have a vacation. I want this to stop, Joachim. Help me. Please. Please. Okay. Joachim. Joachim. Please help me. There's nothing we can do. It's the school's decision, not mine. - But you took that video. - Didn't you want it too? Who lost that phone anyway? I will lose my scholarship. I can't afford this school. And you're my only family here. Anyway, I don't want to go back to this place. What about me? You think I can help you? I will lose my job. I could get jailed for this. Then let's leave. You're not making any sense! Why? - But you told me you loved me. - That wasn't true! Who are you? What happened? The answer to the question is another question. I loved you, but I did not know you. You're an asshole. You just used me, you piece of shit. I'll get you fired! I'll put you behind bars! You piece of shit! I'll put you behind bars! I'll put you behind bars! Go ahead! Do it! Ana. Hello, friend! Hello, Luka! How are you? Sorry for disturbing you. Thank you for letting me stay here. You own these vineyards. Why thank me? Are you okay? This will calm you down. Cheers. Cheers. Where's my wife? She was just here. We spoke. She went to the shop. It's important you take your medicine, that you take it on time. You'll be fine. Medicine? She told me you're unwell, that you decided to get some fresh air. What did she say to you? That you see things and hear strange sounds. That's not true. It's she who's sick. Come on, let's not talk about that. Everyone has a right to some craziness. Let's drink now. To an abundant harvest and to happy love! - Cheers. - Cheers! Let's drink to that. Ana. Ana. Ana, you have not been in school for a week. Where have you been? Why are you such a mess? You better go with Mr. Castro. He will take you home. Ana, let's talk. All right. Let's talk about how you used me. Didn't you say that you loved me? Why? Are you scared? Are you afraid they'll find out you took that video? It means he... Ana. Ana, what are you doing? Ana. Ana, stop. Ana! She's mad. Asshole! She's crazy. What's going on? Ana is having a mental breakdown. What she's saying is not true. Have you taken your medicine? Mara. Don't leave me, Joachim. Joachim. Mara! Mara! Mara! Joachim. Stop it! Don't take a video of me. Don't do it. Mara. Joachim. Hello. - Where are you? - Help me. Mara. - She's here, Joachim. - Where are you? Mara! Mara, where are you? I'm right here, Joachim. You just don't recognize me. But you, I know you very well. Because I researched that plate number. Hello. I was the one who called earlier. Sir, the plate number I mentioned, can you please-- Hello? Hello? Why can't you let go of what has long been dead and buried? I'm not holding onto them. I'm holding onto justice. It's been five years. Five years since you got into that accident with Mom and Dad. It was an accident. No one wanted it to happen. You've forgotten about them. It takes one event to change you. Saba! Saba. What's up? Why didn't you go up? I couldn't. My friend's father lives here. And? He's a policeman. Okay. These drugs are dangerous. Be careful. Thank you, Saba. If I need more, I'll meet you in Tbilisi. I have your number. When are you leaving? Today. Okay, see you in Tbilisi. Mara! Mara. This is my niece's number. And this is the restaurant where you'll work. Thank you, Elene! Mina told me there is a Joachim who visits her boss at the restaurant every Monday. Got it? Please give this to Mina. I hope you find the guy you're looking for. Thank you. Bye. Hey, Giorgi. How are you? I'm fine. It is extra cold today. I will see you later, okay? Giorgi, I really think we should change the flavor of this thing. Yes, you just have to change it. And the pricing-- Sorry. Are you Filipino? Huh? You're Filipino. Sorry, I'm really in a hurry. It takes one event for you to do things you couldn't before. Help me, Joachim. Help me, Joachim. Mara. - What is it? - Do you hear that? Joachim. What? - Help me. - It came from here. - Can't you hear it? - Joachim. Your attacks are getting worse. We'll go to a therapist tomorrow. I'll go with you. Doctor, please help my husband. He is actually outside right now. He's been having hallucinations the past few weeks. I will do everything that I can. He actually thinks I am having therapy now. He is accusing me of having hallucinations. Maybe I can invite you for a session too. No. I don't need help. He is the one hallucinating. Okay. But maybe we can talk, after your husband. No. I am sorry but I have to go. It takes one event to make it easier for you to tell lies. Mara. It takes one event for you to start fooling another person. Mara! Mara! Mara! - Fantastic! - Mara! Help me, Joachim. Joachim! Help me, Joachim. Mara. Joachim. Hello. - Where are you? - Help me. She's here, Joachim. Mara, where are you? Hello! Mara! Mara, where are you? Hello! Joachim. Mara. Mara. - Joachim. - Mara. Mara. - Joachim. - Mara. Joachim, help me. Help me, Joachim. Joachim, help me. You told me you loved me. Ana. Joachim, help me! Mara! Joachim! Don't leave me. Help me. Ana. Joachim! Joachim! Joachim. I have been suffering. It's me, Mara. Help me. Mara. Ana won't leave us in peace. Joachim. What is happening to you? Don't leave me, Joachim. Stop! That's enough! Didn't you tell me you loved me? Ana, forgive me! I was a coward! I regret everything! I didn't know better then! I'm sorry, Ana. Forgive me. Too late. You killed my sister. Joachim. Fuck! My husband is lost! My husband is lost. My husband is lost. Please help me find him. I am married to a lunatic. Mara. Your husband is here. He was here before you. He confessed everything. I am Ana, and I am a lunatic. That's what they say. When is it crazy to fall in love? When is it crazy to trust someone? Where were you when I needed my sister to answer my questions? Where were you when I wanted to be heard but no one would listen? I had no one else but you, but you made me feel alone. You abandoned me. It's too late. I'm exhausted. I still care for you, Mara. Only you held onto delayed justice. I hope you still choose to live in the end. Choose to forgive. Do you know who suffers the most? The ones left behind... because we look for answers to questions... for which the answers are also questions. Mara, forgive me. Forgive me, Mara. Grapes... or sword? Huh? Fuck you!
