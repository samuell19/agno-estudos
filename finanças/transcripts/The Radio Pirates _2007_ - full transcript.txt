THE RADIO PIRATES You're listening to Country FM 99.9. For those who are a little bit country! Now you should see the view. This view, I have not seen in a long time, Karl Jonathan. I thought it was mostly rural land here. It was, 20 years ago. I just wanted out of here. Out to see the world. But you saw Mom instead? You, you see the big house on top there? The wooden building? It is our house. Villa Grannesv?gen Mann. Hold on. Welcome to Skjelleruten Here we fit on You This is Radio Skjelleruten with our morning broadcast ... -Where did the music go? -My name is John Jansen. John Jansen? Who is this jerk? I remind you of the meeting in the square today, at exactly 3 pm. I expect a large attendance, with many important issues on the agenda. But first, a little music. Hey, Hey! Where's my music?! What is going on here now? Damn! Is not it nice with these quiet Sunday morning where we ... A little music ... Dad. Dad! The road has run out! I think I overshot a bit. Yes, what do you think, Karl Jonathan? - Is not it great? - It's a hovel! I cannot stay here. I refuse! -Two coats of paint and we're set. -painting? What about demolition? It'd be much easier! You must see the potential. This place is fantastic. I grew up here. -I understand why Mom wouldn't come. -Enough! No one forced you to be here! You could've stayed in the city with your mother, if that was what you wanted. Enough with the attitude, then! This will work out. Why is there a hole in our garden? That's not a hole. That's a swimming pool. Your grandfather died before he managed to finish it. Fucking shit! Dad! Can I have this? Yes, just take it. It is yours. Damn! Okay ... See what I did? I found your weak point and used it against you. Take a minute, you two. Remember that this just sparring. -Hello? -Hey, kiddo. How's it going? It's fine here, Mom. The house needs just paint and it will be great. Can I talk with your dad, He will not talk in the mobile phone. He believes he has cauliflower ears from it. You know how Dad is. Hey, girls! Take it easy! -When are you coming? -We've talked about this, Karl Jonathan. I have to look to the club, but I promise to come visit. Are you there? You ... But I want you to be here, now! Karl Jonathan? Karl Jonathan? Are you there? Karl Jonathan ... Have you seen the box with the food? I have not eaten since breakfast. I must have something to eat soon. You ... Where's your rabbit? Where are you? We must have something to eat! Come back! Stop! We should have it for dinner! Karl Jonathan! Karl Jonathan! I'm was just kidding! We will not have him for dinner! If you do not stop now, I'll call your mom! First I would like to thank for so many from Skjelleruten for showing up. It is an essential part of our community. The first issue is the helmet, and helmet use. Use of a helmet can be the difference between life and death. Of being able to walk or having to use a wheelchair. The proposal we are starting with, is more use of the helmet - -in the schoolyard. As I understand it, no one is against this proposal. Jonathan! Now stop! Stop, damn it! Little Shit! -What are you doing? Stop! -We must catch the rabbit. Is there anyone who has seen a small boy on a bike cart? You mean the one that just stormed past here, without a helmet? -Yes. -So this is the man - -which barrelled through Skjelleruten this morning. Without regard to noise, safety, security, -- - And littered our streets with canned food. Hi, Johan Grannesv?gen Mann. I own the big house at the top of the hill. Here it is actually not recommended to run around with tools. And axes are to be kept in the sheath when not in use. Sorry. We have quite a lot to talk about, Mr. Grannesv?gen Mann. Maybe your rabbit ran into the woods. Help me look? Piece of gum if you do. In Skjelleruten we are not allowed to chew gum. We are not allowed to run either. And in the schoolyard in the morning you must have on your helmet. And if you are caught doing something wrong, you get a dot. When you have 10 dots, you have to wear the safety suit for a week. -Tyggirei no tape a! -Welcome to the Skjelleruten. -Is it you who live in the old house? -Yes. Villa Grannesv?gen Mann. -Why'd you move here? -Our hamburger joint went bust. Mom owns a boxing gym. So was my dad was mad at mom because she would not use the money to help. That's why we moved here. Since my dad grew up here. -Why'd you not stay with your mother? -Dad has never managed without me. I also had to move here because my parents were fighting. I'm staying with Aunt Claudia. She is easy going. It smells like smoke. -Who are those guys? -It is Konrad & Odin's band. -They look quite dangerous. -I don't like band life. -Now you have to go on without me. -Come on, Konrad! Here's your new vocalist! Yes, we eat it! I don't think they'll eat what he fixes willingly. By Odin's true and pure name, now I'm pissed! Take him! If you catch the little bastard, I'll consider joining the band. Come on, get him! -Where did you learn to throw like that? -Stick ball. I love pitching. It's the only time I can play with others without getting a dot. Hurry! They're coming! -We're running the wrong way! -We're getting away at least. We lost them? I think that, given ... All right. Then I do not rejoin the band, guys. -What is this place? -Maybe it's a radio station? Wow. A pirate radio. Looks like they left in a hurry. This is a message to all kids out there, from ... Skjelleruten Security! In the schoolyard in the morning everyone should wear their helmet! Then bang your head against each other and test if the helmet is strong! You've got a great talent for radio. Too bad no one heard you. Imagine if we could have our own pirate radio. We could have been the deadly radio pirates. So scary and dangerous that no one dares to turn off the radio. Wow! Hi, Aunt Claudia. -Hey, precious. - You're a little late. - Yes. I met Karl Jonathan. That is, he hit me with the bike. And then I forgot the time completely. Well, it can be that way when you're hitting each other. Hey, Karl Jonathan. Hi. Why do you pick flowers in the middle of the night? Yes, if you pick the flowers in the middle at night, they last longer. The moon pulls up lots of juice in the stems so they are quite stiff. If you can get the flowers to stand a long time, -- -it promises a great love. It was nice to meet you, Karl Jonathan. Good night! -You promise to take good care of him? -Yes, of course. Night. -Are you aware of what time it is? -I forgot my way completely. If you had not run away with the rabbit, would you be in bed long ago. You're the one who said I shouldn't always blindly obey authority. -What have you done with the rabbit now? -it's on vacation. It is not nice to eat animals that have names, you know. That's fine. I got our food back from a crazy nut in a wheelchair, Jansen. He told me that they have annexed our land into the community. So the house is now in the town. -Does that mean we have to move? -Not if we follow the rules. We must build wheelchair ramp and secure all dangerous and sharp corner of the house. We must secure everything the site against all possible dangers. It's completely insane! Can they do that? -Yes. It seems so. We have a week. If we are to finish, so please help me, Karl Jonathan. But there are some bright spots. I know how to make money. -Chinese cabbage. -Chinese cabbage? -We plant Chinese cabbage in the garden here. -Chinese cabbage, here in the garden? -Are you sure? -I am sure. After a lifetime in the burger industry, I know - -how much people eat Chinese cabbage in this country here, that is. They eat more Chinese cabbage than in China! -Now you must go to bed. -I need a helmet for school. Why? Yes, I'll see what I find in the attic. Go to bed. Sleep well! "Grannesv?gen Mann's Chinese cabbage" ... Are you excited? And away with ... Villa Grannesv?gen Mann. The country's largest and finest Homes for wheelchair users ... With all the luxury that money can buy. For use by those who are willing to pay. And the top floor ... Where the two of us will live, dear. John, that's all we have talked about and planned, and ... I'm so happy I could sick up. I wish that we could move in tomorrow. They have only one week. They can never be finished. And the wheelchair association have said yes? They have supported us with 30 million. That's nothing compared to all you've done for them. You are a wonderful man, John Jansen. But first of all we must get rid of Villa Grannesv?gen Mann. And when people first move in, they can be ... ... difficult to get rid of. (Why run when you can walk safely?) This is the ... Neat! Do you understand what this means? We have our own radio! Can't you ride a bike? Everyone under 13 must use training wheels. If not ... Tyggirei us a tape! It can't be like that! What is this? Enough with this nonsense! This is completely unacceptable behavior! Enough, Children! -Yes, it's Jansen. -There you are! yes! You must come to school immediately. The children will not listen to me! -It is chaos, you must come. -Calm down. I'm coming. Enough with this nonsense! Stand in formation in front of me! Now! Last night we had a little unfortunate event here in Skjelleruten. A pirate radio, sent out a message that you should test their helmets. This is wrong! You know that safety and security is for everyone. Understand? Young Mr. Grannesv?gen Mann. I doubt that helmet is approved. This is not a carnival. You have to follow our rules, like everyone else. Is that understood? This is our new student Karl Grannesv?gen Jonathan Mann. Since you are new in Skjelleruten, you shall have a security sponsor. Tjerand! We have a point system. You get a dot if you do not behave. You get 10 dots, you have to wear this safety suit for a week. That was the starting dot. To help you understand the consequences of what you do. Now you can go and sit down. Yes,we expect that Karl Jonathan shall learn his place. And hang your bag on the desk. Yes, when you can get your books, we shall go through the lessons from last ... We're broadcasting again tonight. And it's Radio Skjelleruten with our pleasant evening, sending, -- -hopefully for you at home, who possess and hopefully - -enjoying you with a little common sense. We will discuss ... Hello? This is Radio Skjelleruten. We ... This is a message to all kids at Skjelleruten from The Radio Pirates! Remember, you have 10 dots to go on. The Radio Pirates recommends using 8 One dot that is worth a try, is to climb a tree. It is also good for the view. Should someone get 10 dots, the security suit is not so bad. Today's request of Skjelleruten Security is ... Forget the rules! Take chances and be Cool! You've heard from The Radio Pirates! The world's most dangerous radio station! Damn! Yes, this is Radio Skjelleruten. We were interrupted by a pirate broadcast. We will summon law enforcement at soon as possible to come and stop these pirates. First, some soft music. You've reached Karl Jonathan's voicemail. Leave a message. Are you going to help plant, or just going to lie there? Well then, no petting! -He looks pretty angry out there. -Mom says he is like a lemming. And he is just as red and even angrier. So, Jansen, you're here? We've come to look at security here, as agreed. This is Mats Coat, the housing authority's lawyer. Good day, Mr. Grannesv?gen Mann. You do not like the post, I see. Just crap. Bills and advertisements. Letters from debt collectors. Yes, what do you have? Is not bad, that. You wanted a look at standards and safety. Yes, of course. With pleasure. All is secured in accordance to the housing policies. You must change the sign, Mr. Grannesv?gen Mann. This street was called "Rotten Apple" before you ate your first one, Jansen. Housing authority decision. -What will you live on, Grannesv?gen Mann? -Chinese cabbage. -Chinese cabbage? -The stuff grows 20 cm per week. I have reasonably good relations in the hamburger business, so ... Yes, I hope it is very good relationships you have. They're so awful. We must do something. Time to be radio pirates again. Now? How did it go at Grannesv?gen Mann? Not so good. He has done everything we asked for. But do not worry. It will work out. He owes a lot of money. So he moved to Skjelleruten. We buy his debt. As such, He owes us money. He has received a number of warnings, but the fool does not read them. In a week we'll have Villa Grannesv?gen Mann. And then we can do as we want. Thank goodness. But now I have to get ready for my broadcast. Of course. I'll play a serenade for you. I have written it himself. What do you think? -This will stir things up. -Yes, but it's worth it. Besides, no one knows who The Radio Pirates are. Are you ready? We're back! The Radio Pirates! The world's most dangerous radio station. Tonight a rap! And this will be a superhit! "A sour voice we wanna forget" "John Jansen won't give you a chance!" "A sour voice we wanna forget!" "John Jansen won't give you a chance!" "Here we live, it's too much peace. Everyone else gets the dots! " "Tyggirei no tape! This place is flipped" "A sour voice we wanna forget" "John Jansen won't give you a chance!" "John Jansen - we don't like the dance!" -You have heard The Radio Pirates. -The world's most dangerous radio station. Thank you for the evening, and remember to rap the rest of the week. Are you listening? The night is silent like a shooting star. Do you see the Big Dipper? Do you see the star that's almost gone? It died many years ago. And when we're older, Big Dipper will be missing a corner. We'll be Big Dipper's old friends. See that?! Make a wish. -What'd you wish? -I can't say. Let's lay down, so I can stretch out my back. -Do you have a bad back? -It runs in the family. Mom always says that Dad is missing a spine. Are we best friends? -Of course we are. -More than best friends. -More? What do you mean? We are Super Best Friends. Hi! Cool rap from the radio pirates. Yes, really good ... Shall we take it from the beginning? "Sour voice, you just wanna forget." "John Jansen won't give you a chance!" Karl Jonathan! What are you doing? -Have you gone completely crazy? -Nobody knows anything! -You are going to give us away! -Keep it down. You'll be a radio pirate by yourself 0if you don't wise up. Are you chicken? What else do you call it? You do not need to call me anything. Super Best Friends like you ... You can be a radio pirate by yourself from now on. Sisseline ... Come in! How can I help you? I think I know who the radio pirate is. -Oh? ... -Karl Grannesv?gen Jonathan Mann. Why do you think it's him? He is the only one who says "Tyggirei no tape". I did not hear very much on the broadcast, but it was what they said. Tyggirei no tape ... Tjerand ... You will get your reward. But first of all, I have a small task for you. What do you think? "Grannesv?gen Mann's Chinese cabbage. So good that you pass out. " -Yes, it is great ... -What is it with you? Where is Sisseline? Do not know. Safe at home, I guess. -Are you not friends anymore? -Seems not. You, I heard a very funny thing on the radio today. There was a rap - -which was about Jansen. "A sour guy! You must ... " I can not remember how it went. Have you heard it? Yes. It is very funny. Do you think Mom will come visit soon? I do not think she knows where we live, myself. Do not think she'll find it. -Do you miss her, or what? -Yes. A little. A lot, actually. I miss her too a little. When I get up to speed selling cabbage, shall we go to town and visit her? Yes ... And don't pout so. You might catch bird shit on that lip. Yes, we have a truck available. - Brilliant - Is this urgent?. -Yes, of course it's urgent. -Exactly, I understand. We want to get rid of these radio pirates as soon as possible. They have become a major burden and a real problem for us. No problem. We will send an truck immediately. It's like a burning feeling under the soles of my feet. It must mean something important will happen. -What then? -A large black knight. -A great journey and much love. -Love is crap. Okay .. Are you in love yourself? Yes, you must be. It catches you when you least expect it. -I am not in love! -Heartache won't kill you. It's when one suffers that a person learns who they really are. I'm going out. Sisseline ... Maybe take Toball for a walk afterwards. You are listening to The Radio Pirates. The world's most dangerous radio station. This evening will be dancing! All Kids -- Dance til you get blisters!! -Who? -Hi! It is Torslem. -Torslem? -Yes .... -What is it? -You must turn on the radio right away! -They're playing your song. -Which radio? On FM 99.9. You may think this is funny, but I don't! By Odin, the black ... -Do you have something? -There! Hello, This is the tracking service. We have a signal, yes! -Yes, that's brilliant news. -Yes, what do you want us to do? Locate them and stop them from sending immediately. I said, locate them and stop them from broadcasting -- immediately! -The signals are weaker and weaker. -This is the only road! Okay, Aunt Claudia? Sisseline, see him? It's like a black knight. It's Dervar Konrad. He is not the best, exactly. So striking! Yes, it is urgent. The truck is down in a big hole and a crane is needed. This is a very difficult ... Jansen, yes. -Where? -What? -Where is the damn album? -It's not me. There are radio pirates. They overpower our broadcasts. They broadcast from the woods. But it's over tomorrow. I'm demolishing the radio pirate's house in the morning. At 5 pm it is quite, quite over. Hi. -Hey you. -Hi. You ... You are so black. You cheeky runt! Konrad! This is my radio station! My music! -What are you doing here? -I'm broadcasting radio. Then you've made your last radio broadcast! The song was never played. Should never have been played! Why not? Does it have to do with the lady in the picture? It was a tribute to her. And then she left me so ... ... so I just left it all behind. Forever. Scram! You'll get your punishment tomorrow when they demolish your house. At 5 pm? Who will? Jansen. But Dad doesn't know anything about it! You must help us! Scram! Hi! Yes, I have with me two contracts. 5 million, as agreed. Then we will both sign. This is yours. Two copies. Sign here. I've got a unanimous authorization from the housing cooperative. Where we want to get house of Grannesv?gen Mann, -- -replaced with Wheelchair Palace. The demolition can not take place until after 5 pm Then the housing cooperative duly owns the house and its furnishings. Yes, fantastic. This means that at 5 pm we can tear down Villa Grannesv?gen Mann? Yes. If the former owner or his son is not present... In which case, we must call the police. Yes. Do you have a phone number for this Mr. Grannesv?gen Mann? Yes, yes, of course. -Yes? -Am I speaking with Johan Grannesv?gen Mann? -That's right. -Yes, wonderful. I'm calling from ?kern fruit and vegetables. I hear you have Chinese cabbage that will be for sale. Yes. Yes, it's really good Chinese cabbage. -Premium. -Yes, correct. So good!

You can let your self out? I'll be broadcasting. "Karl Jonathan, happy birthday!" "Have gone to town to sell Chinese cabbage..." "Next time you stay over with Sisseline, you need to tell me first." Karl Jonathan! Karl Jonathan! Karl Jonathan! Karl Jonathan ... What happened? -Who did this? -Don't know. He jumped me and never said a word. We must hurry! Jansen will tear Villa Grannesv?gen Mann at 5 pm! -Can he do that? -He thinks he can do whatever he wants. We must tell my father about Grannesv?gen Mann. -He has gone to sell Chinese cabbage. -He's doesn't have a phone! Thank you. I got it! We can talk to my dad via radio. He always listens to the radio in the car! We can't get in there. What do we do? Sunroof is open! Hurry! It's already 4 pm! Important message to my dad! You must come home now!

Five, fur ... Three ... Two ... One ... -Jansen, you fucking pest! -Good try, Mr. Grannesv?gen Mann. You are unfortunately a little too late. Borettslaget has purchased your debt. You owe us 1.5 million kroner. The deadline expired at 5 pm. I do not have the money right now, but as soon as I sell Chinese cabbage ... Chinese cabbage? We will tear it down now. Today. Please leave. You are on the authority's property. -This is my childhood home ... -Calm down! We can solve this, can't we? If everyone is a little reasonable. Let them pay the debt! Only if housing authority leader, John Jansen, agrees. And so does he ... No. Go ahead with the demolition. Now! Now! -Jansen has fooled you all! -Bullshit! Continue demolition! No! Stop! My God! But ... John ..? This ... This can be explained. This ... This, Sleiva ... I may need a lawyer in the near future. -It is a miracle! -John! John! Wait for me!
