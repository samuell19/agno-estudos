Hey, We are here. Hello... Right... Where is your husband? He is on a business trip. You don't even cry... Go play with other kids. Get yourself together. She didn't pass away suddenly, did she? We should buy Kimchi from now on... Sangjun only eats his granny's Kimchi... Sounds funny but I can't even remember the taste of Kimchi my ex-wife used to make. Now I will forget the taste of her Kimchi, too... 'Now!' 'Go back to your real shape!' 'Crow Card!' What are you listening? Are you on a school holiday? Yes, you've, grown... Well, yes, I've grown tall 30cm this year. Remember I am your older brother. We are on the same grade but I am a year older than you. I was taller... Not anymore. Hey, do you have a boyfriend? No... My girlfriend has the same name as you. Hwang Do-Yeon Her nick name is also Whangdo like you. Funny, huh! I heard no one was there when she died... but apparently she died in asleep. Well that' nice at least. Come! Look, this is my father. Where is my mum's... This is Auntie?s wedding, right? She is really pretty.. How come you look so different from your mum? I am so sorry Thanks for coming. Go eat and take a rest. I am ok When was your husband coming? Shall we talk outside awhile? I heard you'd been promoted. That's excellent. Well done! doing everything... When we were kids, you taught me how to ride a bike... remember? I still have a scar on my knee. You were not a quick learner. When I was falling over... I knew a few seconds before that I was falling over. Ah, I am going to fall over... and then I fell over. I knew it would end like that with him as well. What are you talking about? Can I have a cigarette? I got divorced a while ago... You... how come you didn't even consult with me before... I didn't want to make you worried... I am sorry. What about him? What is he doing? Even though, he didn't even show up? Just living apart from me would make him happy enough. I will wait for you, I miss you. Please give me a ring, I am so worried about you. Ah... damn it. Don't hold it too hard. keep the balance. Relax. Is pedaling a bit too hard? Get off. I will get the gear lower for you. Try again I will learn it next time. You idiot! Should have braked. I did... Let me see. damn! grazed a lot! Pretty.! 'OK here is an OX quiz.' 'Heungboojeon was originated from Bang-ii tale.' 'Right, Park Ji-Sun was a bit quicker.' - 'The answer is?' - 'The answer is O.' 'O is correct.' 'The proposed word for Set A is Execution' 'and for Set B is Keyboard.' 'What will you choose?' 'I will have Keyboard.' 'Ok then, First question of Set B,' 'here you are.' 'Within one octave of the piano,' 'which keys are more? white keys? or black keys?' Can you go call your mum? Surprised? It's so boring. Let's go to the school. Now? Isn't it exciting? I am scared... That's why it is more exciting. Are you cold? hurts! I can't. It's too tight... It's ready. Who was the man, yesterday? He is from my work. Then why did you send him back? You don't need to know... Did you have an affair? Is it why you got divorced? What if I said yes? And what if I said no, will you still believe me? I tried fortune telling with names of mine and my girlfriend's and it said our love is destined. You and I are cousins so that's quite right, isn't it? Do you really believe that? You think I ruined your life, right? And you still think your wife did that because of me, huh? And you think mum died alone in this rural town because of me! Anyway we will forget everything. What... What? Have I ever seen you crying? Did you cry you fell off the bike? Do-Yeon, I am going to piss in my pants! Mum, I got on my period. Stay here. I will tell you about it more when we get home. 'Ministry of Agriculture has announced that' 'if there is any doubt of bird flu,' 'all the chickens and ducks' 'should get buried without confirming.' 'Today there were several reports of bird flu suspicions' 'from seven different cities including Naju in Jeonam.' 'I am on a farm in Jeonam Muan' 'where five hundred ducklings have been buried.' 'A number of civil officers are' 'working hard to get the ducklings from a coop.' 'Those ducklings' 'have not yet found the possibility of bird flu but...' Hi! Are you going to work now? I will come by later! It's raining and no customers. It's terrible today and all the coffee is left. He is growing day by day. Isn't he? he is so heavy now and I can't cuddle him too long anymore. Is it good? having a baby, I don't know. Sometimes yeah, but more often it's no... Actually I don't want to tell you that it is better without any kids, But to be honest, It is better to have. It looks like a destiny in some way. I am destined to have a baby because I kept getting pregnant even though I got abortions so many times. You are just not like that. Tell you what. He disappeared. He packed all and ran away. I didn't do it... Don't you see that? Why did you do it on the floor when you have a pot! You did it on purpose to drive me crazy. I know it. You did the same thing when you were normal. You... didn't like to see me happy. you are still doing it on purpose... I know that! I am hungry. Give me food. I am not hungry yet! Give me food. Give me food~ I am hungry, Give me food! I am hungry! Hello, anybody here! Give me food! Rice... Rice! Give me food! Rice! Give me food! What is it about? I am sorry to say but it is mandatory to bury all since these areas are infected. It is so quick. I am so sorry. I've got nothing to say. I win! Give me food now quickly! Hello? Hello? Irye Irye... Cheer up... It's hard for me too but... Cheer up, Irye. You should go home. Jinyoung might have been awake. Jinyoung... Here comes mummy! Mum... Mum... Mu... Mum... Mum, Mum... Mum... What else can you do? If you let your daughter adopted then you could also legally immigrate. The result is everything... not the way of doing it. There is also a nice man to marry.... Do it right. Don't make any trouble like last time. Damn it, I don't know. How can I tell him? - I am off now - Ah, OK... good bye Your mum will get married to a nice Korean man and you should have a good life with new parents. You could meet her later, of course. Your new parents will send you a beauty school. You could learn haircut skills and open your own beauty shop. That's good, isn't it? Welcome Sujin. You must have had a long journey. Hello. Here Please take a good care of Sujin. I lost three kids in an accident. Don't worry, I will look after her as my own daughter. Yes? Go prepare dinner! Ah, Yes You do well in the kitchen. It's difficult to move around for her so... You should look after all the housework now. Yes... Where are you going? Eat some food before you go out. I am ok For god's sake... Only grandson is so useless... Come over here. What do you think? isn't it great? This is the treasure of our village. People in Seoul have them as a pet. It's a kind of trend... and guys eat gurb powder. Hi Who is this? My daughter. From China. Not much to do here. Try not to touch those stag beetles. They die early if they get stressed out. Those horns look cool aren't they? Those are for protecting family... but in this cage they have a plenty of food so they only use them when they fight for female... the female die right after laying eggs... How old are you? Seventeen You got used to it now. Do you have your period on time? I am not so regular... Let's go and see a doctor with me... Honestly, there was one before you. Hey, I am here. You... Have you heard about my mum? She is good. Do you know where she is? Somewhere in Busan... Don't worry, she is living happily with a new family. Is it twins? That looks quite huge as first one. That might be better. You could sell one and raise one... isn't it? The money is twice... Whang, watch your fucking mouth. Ah... yes I am going into town so clean up the farm during the day. Have some breakfast. I don't want it. I don't need dinner. Oh! Thank you... It's time for them flying. Wow, like birds They are actually nocturnal but the female fly more at night. Yes... Yes...
