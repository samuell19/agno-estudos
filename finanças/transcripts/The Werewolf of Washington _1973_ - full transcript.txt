- [Jack] That it could happen in America. That it could happen now. That it could ever happen to me. (suspenseful music) Jack Whittier Whittier is my name. Maybe you remember my byline. I was the youngest member of the Washington Press Corps. It's fastest rising star. One of the best and brightest as we used to say. Before so much blood passed under those pretty Potomac bridges. I was having an affair with the president's daughter and I wanted out, without hurting her feelings or frankly, my career. So I had my paper reassign me to our bureau in Budapest. Somehow the President heard I was banished for been too pro administration and he offered me a job, which I couldn't refuse. Which is where the terrible events that were to destroy my career and my life begin. - [Giselle] I bought it, it's silhouette. I found it in a little shop. I didn't think there were such thing left. - What's it for? - [Giselle] You mean, you don't know? (birds singing) - [Jack] Honest to God, Giselle, I'll have you leave Washington within six weeks. I'll get you a visa. I'll get you a job. - [Giselle] I don't want a job. A job with who. The FBI? - [Jack] Stop it, Giselle, now will you come on? (car engine humming) (car horn hooting) (tires screeching) (crickets chirping) Hey, fella, what do you think you're doing? You trying to get somebody killed? You rammed me right into the tree. What are you doing, standing here, right in the middle of the road? What are you psyched or something? What's the matter, can't you speak English? Giselle, will you get back in the car, I gotta make it to the airport. (car door slamming) (car engine sputtering) (car door slamming) I'm sorry, sir. I just, I lost my temper. But my car won't start and I have to catch a plane. That's very important. Do you know, is there a gas station around or someone that could help me? (bike bashing) Hey... It won't start. Hey, mister! I really need help! How do you say... (speaking in foreign language) Come on. (speaking in foreign language) Now please, the only I'm asking you is because my car crashed because of him. Now could you just give me a little help, please? (speaking in foreign language) I'm dying to hear this one. - She said, if we want to leave, then leave. - Then leave, we can't leave! Goddammit! I told him my car is stuck. (speaking in foreign language) It's over there by the-- (yelling in foreign language) Listen, it's because of him, its all his fault. He ran me off the road. (car door slamming) - [Giselle] Come on. - [Jack] What are you afraid of, we don't have to go anywhere. It cost me 15 hundred million dollar for the man of the year. (car engine roaring) What are you looking at? Were you looking at Giselle? Not you. (Jack yelling) Hey, what's the matter with you? Hey, come on and check it, will ya? (crickets chirping) There's gotta be a house down that road where I can get a phone. Just wait for me here, Giselle. Leave the headlights on, okay. - [Giselle] Okay. (car door slamming) (wolf howling) (suspenseful music) - [Man] There, there. - Over there? - Yes. - All right, fine. Is it far? - Yes. - Long distance? It's far? - Yes, yes, it is far. - How far? - Not too much. - Oh, good, I can walk. - No, not tonight, come in. - Do you know what time? The departure schedule of the train? - The moon, moon. Come in. - What the? - Not tonight, please. - No, thank you, I'm in a hurry. - Come in, come in. - What are you afraid of? (door banging) Giselle? Giselle? (wolf howling) (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (crickets chirping) Giselle? (wolf howling) (dramatic music) (wolf growling) (wolf yelping) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) - And so, it must have been a wolf. We could find no corpse. - Oh, come on. I killed a man and I killed him with this thing. - You said it was an accident, my boy. - I was an accident. But are you gonna take my word for it? Aren't you going to detain me? - The Inspector has already looked, his car and his driver. - What's going on here? This country is crawling with bureaucrats. Where are they? Why aren't the here questioning us? - [Giselle] Jack, they are willing to let go us. Let's go. - What are you trying to cover up? Is the White House behind this? - The what house? - The White House. - It isn't him, don't even know what are you saying. (train whistle blowing) (speaking in foreign language) - What'd she say? - [Giselle] She says, you are feverish. It was after one. - I'm afraid I must ask you to leave the area at once. I tell you again, no one has been reported missing. No corpse has been found. If you continue to make a nuisance of yourself, I shall have you locked up. - How come you speak English? Huh? (car engine chugging) (crickets chirping) That was your son that I killed, wasn't it? (speaking in foreign language) - Yes, that was her son. - And you don't even care that I killed him? (speaking in foreign language) - She says, you didn't kill him. You released him. He needed to die. He longed to rest. - Because of the communist? Secret police? (speaking in foreign language) - The pentagram. - Because of the sign of the the pentagram. - Ah, the Pentagon is behind all of this. - The pentagram. The mark of the beast. This. - Oh, that's just a bunch of insanity. (speaking in foreign language) - Whoever is bitten by a werewolf and live, becomes a werewolf himself. - Oh, bull. Find out who she's working for. (speaking in foreign language) - The wolf bit you, didn't he? - Yes, dammit. (speaking in foreign language) (suspenseful music) - [Jack] Wear this charm over your heart always. And remember, a werewolf can only be killed with a silver bullet or a stick with a silver handle. (speaking in foreign language) - [Jack] Heaven help you, my son. (dramatic music) (gentle music) (toilet flushing) (door knocking) - [Woman] Jack? The President wants to see you. He's in my bedroom. (guests chattering) - We worked for everything we had. And you know, we had a deed from the King of England for our property in Maryland. And now Larnies kids want to come and they wanna give it to the communist, just give it. Isn't the right, Maurice? I mean, you agree with me, don't you, honey? Well, Vaughn, aren't you going to do something about it? - We're gonna change the constitution. - Oh, thank heaven. Well, I meant to say, you should rewrite it. And I think I have a few points... (door knocking) - Jack, come in, come in. Good to see you, Jack. - Mr. President. - Yeah, you're looking fine, just fine. Ur, settle it any way you want to. Just make sure it doesn't fall back on my lap or the Attorney Generals. How was your flight, Jack? - I mean, I think Washington is going to be quite a come-down in many ways. I'm gonna have to sell my stock. - Even though you're my Press Aid, your job will deal mainly with the Justice Department. The Attorney General is just too honest for his own good. Need to help restore his image with the press. And also deal with the Captree nomination. Especially the Captree nomination. Have you met Mrs. Captree? - It doesn't matter, if Elliot looses the nomination, we'll just be mighty happy to stay home and make money, won't we? (group laughing) - [Jack] No, sir. - She's gonna be a problem. How do you tell a man to dump his wife for the good of his country? (President chuckling) Well, anyway. I want to restore some balance in the court. With a Southerner, we could give them a sense of belonging down there. Goddammit, you know what that means, Jack? - I think I do, sir, yes. - Now, that's all the speech I have for now. But we'll talk some more later. Have you seen Marion yet? I don't understand you young people. She's seeing a nice young man nowadays. You should get to know him. He's a psychiatrist. A Naval psychiatrist. I think you'd like him. - And Senator Bod, does not represent the people of Maryland. (gasps) Hello there, Mr. President. You know, I was just telling the Attorney General here that Senator Bob, oh, he makes me so sick. I just can't stand it. - Mrs. Captree, I'm sure your husband doesn't even feel that strongly about it. - [Mr. Captree] Why, thank you, Mr. President. - Jack, you see the kind of problems we have here. Judge, I want you to meet Jack Whittier the new Assistant Press Secretary. - [Mr. Captree] How do you do? - And Mrs. Captree. - Oh, is he the Jewish young man that you hired to muzzle me? (Mrs. Captree laughing) - No, I'm afraid. - Oh, well, you look smart. - [President] I'm going to excuse myself now. - You sleep tight now, Mr. President. - [President] Oh, Marion. - Hello, Jack. - My, that Marion's such a lovely girl. Did the Washington Times really send you to Siberia, socking the truth to them, Mr. Whittier? - It was Hungary. - What? - Hung-- - Come on, Margie. I think it's time we left for home too. - Oh, no, Eliot honey. Well, why don't you run along like you always do. I'm sure this nice young man will see me home. Won't you, honey? - Certainly, Ma'am. (suspenseful music) (gentle music) I think your father's a cross between Abraham Lincoln and Jesus Christ. - I'm engaged to be married, Jack. - Already? To that psychiatrist guy? (suspenseful music) (gentle music) Mrs. Captree, are you ready-- - Oh, I'm just having one for the road. Oh. You know, anytime you have people marching in the streets, you're just catering to a revolution. You know what my husband says? Well, my husband said many times that he actually prefers some of the Russian communist. The liberal communists in this country. What's the matter with my hand? - Huh? Oh, nothing. (gentle music) - Goodness, my, Jack. You're just a devil, aren't ya? (suspenseful music) - [Salmon] Hi, good evening, hiya. I thought I'd come over and say good evening to you. - Well, hi. - Commander Salmon. Why don't you come in and talk to me sometime, Jack? We'll have a talk. - All right, sure. - Now, where were we? Where were we? We were saying something about... (suspenseful music) (Mrs. Captree humming) (animal growling) (Mrs. Captree humming) (animal growling) (Mrs. Captree screaming) - I watched the damn thing myself, they didn't have a, they didn't even have a station break. And this prejudice hostile critic as the commentator they put on, right after the President's address about Captree. Well, I have the networks work, they're gonna bury this guy someplace. - [Jack] What do you mean? - Give him the ax, drop it. - [Jack] You're kidding? - No, the President is fed up with this guy's facial expressions and gestures. We've got some friends there. It's the other networks I'm worried about. Here, take a look at the speech the Vice President is gonna read tomorrow night. (woman screaming) (hand slapping) We are going to war against the networks, Jack. We're going to win back the minds and hearts of the American people. And we have got to have Captree on that court to win the fight or we're in trouble. Hell, you understand that. Hey, look, Jack, there's a line in there, we had trouble with, something about the views of a small group, the small, how does small strike you? That's a little soft. What would you call your compatriots at the press if you wanted to be, you know, more flashy? - Ur... Let's see. Well at their worst coterie of impudent snobs (laughs). Or nobody really-- - That's good. No, that's great. We'll use it. - [Jack] You're kidding? - No, it's just what we want. Look, the man told me to give you a draft of the speech and listen to your suggestions on it. Now I know why. I want you to spice it up a bit, huh? - Well, I don't know. I mean, I wouldn't use that line I just suggested. - Why not? That is exactly what we want. (telephone ringing) Not now! Yeah. My God. What's this country coming to? Mrs. Captree was just found dead. Guts ripped open. (woman screaming) (gentle music) - How have you been? I guess I asked that last night. - Yeah, I guess you did. Gee, I hadn't been in the White House in a long time. - Well, not everyone get to see all of the White House, Jack. - Well, I'm supposed to meet with your father. - It's really awful about Mrs. Captree, isn't it? And those shoes they found, that's weird. - Shoes? Giselle, um, Marion... The President's waiting for me. I better not keep him. - Hasn't Judge Captree asked that his nomination be withdrawn because of this horrible tragedy? - I've asked him not to make that request. Frankly, I don't want his name withdrawn. The current permissive trends continue in this country. I'm worried about national anarchy. Andrea, you and I, we don't see eye to eye about most things. Never asked me to support and I've never received it. (suspenseful music) But if your paper could change its position, it would swing the nomination for him. - I'll think about it, Mr. President. - Good. I'm sorry to have kept you here so late. Oh, by the way, I have asked the FCC to act as quickly as possible to file that application. No matter what position you take. After all I do owe you a favor. If you hadn't banished Jack here to Budapest, well, I wouldn't have a new Assistant Press Secretary. Oh, evening, darling. - Mr. President, we didn't banish Jack, I begged him to stay here. Didn't I, Jack? He requested the transfer for personal reasons and he's welcome to come back anytime. - Thank you. (suspenseful music) - Jack? - Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. I have to go, Mr. President, I'll see you tomorrow. - I'll leave with Jack. - No! - Jack, um-- - No, I mean I'll stay here with you, Mr. President. - I'll help you get over, Mr. President. I may surprise you. - Oh, thank you, Andrea. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, Jack. Goodnight, Marion. - Jack, Jack? Jack, I think I could be a friend, Jack. If you could just accept that. I'd like to be. You don't look well, Jack. (door slamming) Jack? - [Jack] Don't wait for me there, Marion. Wait for me in your room. Go away, now! (wolf howling) (door rattling) - Jack? (door rattling) Jack? (car engine humming) - [Andrea] Hello? Hello? (werewolf growling) (werewolf panting) (werewolf growling) (woman screaming) (dramatic music) (tires screeching) - Says it's a werewolf. - A weird wolf? - A werewolf. Werewolf. Can you imagine what happened if the press gets a hold of that? I think the kid did themself. - He looks like he could sever a jugular. - Well, I don't think the kid did it. - Now, maybe he did do it. His obvious hatred of female authority figures. The expression he keeps using, mother. Now it fits the pattern of the crimes. Prominent middle aged women found near National Monuments. - [Jack] Well, I don't think the kid did it. - You're the whiz kid. You keep it from the press. - Hi, how are ya? Could you just tell me exactly what you saw? - Look with just all this figure running away. - A figure running away? Was it a man or a woman, was it light or dark. Well, was it light or dark? - It was too dark to tell. - The figure was dark, wasn't it? This figure was dark? - All right, it was dark, it was very dark. - Debbie, Debbie, just be cool. - A black man? - No, it was a werewolf, you racist pig. - Oh, just one minute-- - Now, don't point your finger at me. - Who you talking to? - I'm not lying. - Take it easy, take it easy. - Look, we didn't do anything. - Take it easy. Now, could you kids tell me something more detail about this running figure? - It was hairy. It walked funny. - Uh-huh? - The Panthers. - [Jack] How do you know it's the Panthers? - I know it! Book 'em. - Book 'em? Wait a minute, what for? - Narcotics. - Oh no. Now wait a minute, now listen. (Jack whispering) Where you kids staying? - At the Chevrolet Hilton. - The what? (woman laughing) - Big bus on the mall. - I'm just trying to help you. We're going to assign an FBI agent to keep you under surveillance or else we're gonna have to lock you up. - Oh, wow, man. - Thank you. - [Jack] Huh? - You stay with 'em. - Well, sir, do you have any leads, I mean, this is the second murder of a national known figure in two days. Are you sure you have enough manpower to trap the killer? I mean, your boys seem to be busy with the networks. - Let me tell you something. None of this would've happened if you people didn't support the very elements in our society that did this. - Easy, easy, don't let them get to you. - How do you know that we support the elements when you don't have one single lead? - We do have a suspect. And an indictment is imminent. - Sir, I must insist that you stop talking to these people. - Does imminent mean today, tomorrow or indefinitely, sir? - Imminent means tomorrow morning, nine o'clock. - I'm sorry, sir-- - And won't you bleeding hearts be surprised? - He doesn't have one indictment. He's too busy investigating us. - You see, see! Jack? Jack? (suspenseful music) - [President] This is another one of our washrooms. I don't suppose you asked about anything this convenient on this level. - No, sir. (man laughing) - I guess not. I understand that the three of you are cooped up on one of these for how long is that? - It's about two weeks all together, sir. - Two weeks. - Sir, you mind if I? - Oh, no, no, you go right ahead. - Oh, this thing doesn't work. - Huh? Oh, let me give you a hand. (door rattling) Oh, that's strange. - That's all right, sir, I'll use this one. - No, no, no, that's not the point. (door banging) That's odd? (door banging) Nobody in there. (door banging) I'll just reach down under it and get the latch for you. - Sir, I'll do in just a second. - No, no, no, no. (anxious music) (door banging) You just go about your business. (door banging) I'll get the janitor to look at that. (toilet flushing) You know, it's odd, we had one of you fellas up on the moon, but when it comes to fix an old latch like that, we're just all thumbs. Oh, good, there's a Remington I wanna show you out here, that Blackwoods gave to me a few years back. (door thumping) (door clicking) Oh, just hold it there. Don't wanna forget this. Two weeks. The three. - [Astronaut] Two weeks. (door thumping) (dramatic music) - [Jack] God. - I can only give you a minute, but I'd like you to stay and see the Senator. - Mr. President, I'm not feeling very well. Do you think you might want to find someone to replace me. - You mean, right now? Well, sure, go ahead, take a nap, Jack. - No, I mean, generally, sir. - Come on, Jack, you're doing a fine job. You're indispensable to me. I need you to now more than ever. - It's about those shoes, sir. - Shoes? - Yeah. - What shoes? Jack, would you please stop scratching the palms of your hands? It's just not manly. - It's about the murders, sir. I don't believe that the Panthers did them. - Oh, there hasn't been a murder since we put a guard of that black boy. - But the moon has arisen yet. Put a guard on me. (radio commentator speaking) - Damn that mob out there. (hand banging) Now look, Jack. What is the meaning of this? That speech you wrote last night was just great. The networks, they don't know what hit them. And it's all because of you. I wanna assign you full-time to writing speeches for the Vice President. - Mr. President... I think I'm... I think I'm a... (door clicking) I think I'm a werewolf. - The Senator, Mr. President. - What? - The Senator. - Speak up, goddammit, I can't hear you. - The Senator, Mr. President. - Oh, send her in. - [Commentator] Throw it up for grabs, as he threw it up, that... (T.V. clicking) - Now, Jack, we all get disturbed at some time or another over some damn little thing. But I won't hear of you leaving the team till you've had a chat with Commander Salmon. All right? - Mr. President? Hello? - Oh, Joan, it's good to see you. Come in, come in. - I'm a murderer. (suspenseful music) I killed someone last night. Dr. Salmon, do you believe that a man can change into an animal? - An animal? - Have you ever heard of the mark of the beast? - What? - There's a curse on me. I was bitten by a wolf. Only it wasn't a wolf. - Only, it wasn't a wolf. - It was a werewolf. And now, when the full moon rises, I change into an animal with only one desire. The desire to kill. - [Dr. Salmon] Oh, Jack, really, werewolf. Thank you. - Well, what about my blackouts? And my scar, and my finger? And what about those shoes? - I think you're in trouble, Jack, but not the kind of trouble you're think you're in. - What about my seeing the sign of a pentagram? - Well, sometimes we see our conflicts in terms of political symbols. - Well, what's politics gotta do with this. - Well, what does the Pentagon have to do with it? - The pentagram. - Gentlemen, - The five-pointed star. - [Waiter] Are you ready to order dinner now? - Doctor, would you come to the bathroom with me? - [Waiter] Later, sir. - Please. Come with me to the bathroom. - [Dr. Salmon] Later. - Would you, please? - What for? - I must show you something. - Show me here. - It's on my chest. - All right. Jack, I don't wanna talk about your symptoms now but they're not very hard to explain. Now you feel guilty because you were with both of these women when they were killed. - You know think that in itself is strange? - And you have the feeling that you could've done something to stop it. Coupled with guilt feelings for having murderous-- - [Jack] Well, look at this. - Guilt feelings for having murderous wishes towards these women over evil reasons for both of which you want to be punished. - Will you look at this. - So? - I saw this in the palm of each of my victims. - Jack, I want to help you. - Well then, lock me up. - Come over to the hospital tomorrow and we'll talk it over. - But someone's gonna die tonight! - [Man] Will you two faggots, shut up! - Now, Jack, I cannot help you unless you really want me to help you. Now remember what I told you. - Jack Whittier on the line for Cliff Napes. Cliff? Jack, fine. A little favor. Now looked, who would I talk to over there to find out if someone from Budapest is a red dart? Maybe Chinese. G-I-S-E-L-L-E, Frennik, F-R-E-N-N-I-K. French Romanian, about 30. Correspondent for the Budapest House Oregon. (telephone ringing) Jack Whittier? Hi, angel. Dr. Salmon? Yes I did. (Jack sighing) But now he has me thinking that whatever was bothering me was all in my mind. (suspenseful music) No, no. Oh, no, that's just between me and my analyst. (dramatic music) Yeah, I'm fitting all the pieces together. I'm beginning to think that while I was in Budapest, I was brainwashed or something. Yeah, to cover up so political activities here. (suspenseful music) It's some issues. No. What? You want to come over here? Tonight? (Jack chuckling) I just hope your secret service man never publishes a book. Why, sure, sure, come over. I don't know, maybe you'd better not. (Jack sobbing) Oh, god, please, don't let me go through this again. (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (werewolf growling) (werewolf panting) (glass shattering) - [Woman] Hey, we're going for a walk. - Good idea, let's go. - Oh, man, without you, you know, we wanna make it. You know what I mean, don't you, make it? Do it. - We got small steps. - No, man, we wanna take a walk. Could you stay behind you, you know like 100 paces? - No, seriously, I wanna make a phone call, mister, ur... - Murphy, Randy Murphy. - I'm gonna go call Sally, okay? - Yeah, man. (coin jingling) - Information? Yeah. Randy Murphy, he's somewhere in Georgetown, I think. Yeah. Right. Thank you. (coin jingling) (telephone dialing) Hello, Mrs. Murphy? This the werewolf of Washington. (woman growling) I know just what you want. (woman growling) - Are they in or? - No, no. I left a message, they'll be back later. (suspenseful music) - [Man] Well, are you ready to go? Look, come on, let's... (werewolf growling) (woman screaming) - [Woman] Why are you taking pictures? (werewolf growling) (woman screaming) Please! (werewolf growling) (woman screaming) (werewolf growling) (werewolf growling) (woman screaming) (woman sobbing) (dramatic music) (woman screaming) (werewolf growling) (woman screaming) (werewolf growling) (gun firing) (werewolf growling) (gun firing) (woman sobbing) - Mr. President? - Mr. President? - Ladies and gentlemen, before I answer your questions I would like to make a brief announcement. I have called this conference because of the mass hysteria and now tragedy surrounding a case that we're all very much aware of. Aware of. Today, I'm pleased to announce the indictment of... (President coughing) Secondly, the anarchist must be punished. And thirdly-- - [Reporter] I think he's messing it up. - We must have Captree on the Supreme Court. If he so threatens of people, they will stop at nothing. (President coughing) Questions? - [Reporters] Mr. President? - Mr. President? - Yes? - Sir, is it true that the same black man you are holding for murder, was himself brutally attacked last night? - No, I didn't point at you. I was pointing at her. Her. - Mr. President? The Vice President made a speech last night, I was wondering if he would comment on it. - Yes, I'm glad you asked that question. I would like to make one thing perfectly clear. (chair thumping) The Vice President does not clear his speeches with me. (President laughing) - [Reporters] Mr. President? - Is the conference over? - No. I just had to leave. - You know, I tried calling you last night after you hung up. Where were you? (suspenseful music) - [Jack] Did you? Where was I? I don't know. - I'm sorry to interrupt, but the colored... The black kid died. - I don't care what it is your going through, son. Commander Salmon assures me that you're problems will not interfere with your job, and that's good enough for me. - But I don't think Dr. Salmon-- - Wait, wait. Wait, Jack, wait. (bowling ball rumbling) (President laughing) Ah, look at that. Now, Jack. - Sir. - I don't care what this gypsy lady told you. Commander Salmon tells me that in your case, or let me say that in this case, the existence of a werewolf has not been verified. So how could you be a werewolf? - Well, sir-- - Where's the ball? Where's the damn ball? - Sir? - Take off your shoes, or get in gutter. - [Jack] I've gotta let you know a little secret. - You know this is not, but I get frightened too. (President groaning) I like you, Jack. I really do. Here, like the son I never had. I see a lot of myself in you. I see you going places, Jack and I'd like to be part of it. There it is, coming up down there. - [Jack] Mr. President, tonight when the moon is full-- - Tonight when the moon is full. Got a hold of yourself, boy. (President muttering) You're just going through a crisis. I know about crisis. You run from this one, you run into the next one. Jack, where did you go to school? - University of Chicago, sir. - You play any ball there? - Just four-ball handball, sir. They didn't have varsity sports. - I swear, there's nothing wrong with four-ball handball. Here, here, listen, I want you to take a ball. I want you to bowl a few balls with me. Go on, take a ball and go over to that alleyway, over there. Just pick it up and step over there, that's it. Jack, I want you to watch this. Watch me, Jack. - Yes. - Watch me. Here we go. (bowling ball rumbling) (pins crashing) (President laughing) Look at that shot. Go ahead, you take a shot, go ahead, go ahead. (suspenseful music) Go ahead, come on, take a shot. This morning vote for Senate, let me have the man I want in the Supreme Court. You think I don't care about that, huh? Do you? Take your position, come on. Get up the line there, that's it. (Jack sighing) Now, I can show you how to have a good time. Time for testing and soul searching. I'll strike out at my enemy, swiftly and boldly. Maybe even tonight. Play, boy. Jack? - Yes. - Throw the ball. - I'm sorry. - No, not like that. Here, look, get down. On your knees. On your knees, on your knees. Bend your knees. - Yes, sir. - Ah, that's it. Now we have the ball back and we're just gonna let it rip down the ally. Right, that's it, get the ball, right there. Get your hands down there. - Yes. - And when you get the ball like this, let it whiz, let it go. You think I'll run from a battle? Jack, will you throw the ball, throw the ball down there. - Yes, sir. - I went to, shoot now. (drowned out by sighing) miss the target completely. Oh, son, only a few of us left in the boat now. Got to stick together and play for one another. I believe in you, Jack. I want you to believe in me. I promise to stand by you in this crisis, Jack, if you'll promise me that you'll stand by yourself. Jack, throw the ball, for Christ sake. - I can't, sir. - Why, sure you can, just throw it. - No, I can't, I've been trying to tell you. - Jack, what kind of a man are you, anyway? - I've been trying to tell you, sir. The first thing happens, my fingers start to swell before the moon rises. And now my fingers are stuck in the ball, I can't get it off. - Okay, Jack. I have a meeting in the War Room, please. - I can't go. - Jack, look, Commander Salmon will be there, everybody will be fine. - I'm stuck in the ball! - Give me that goddam ball. Pull! (men grunting) Nothing wrong with that ball. Nothing at all. - [Military Man] You see, these pilots load up their planes with bombs flying 'em anywhere that you want, drop 'em anywhere they want, without any authorization. They're so damn incorrigible. And then it drops in our lap. And we don't hear about it, till we read it in the papers. Well, I'm fed up with been a nice entire country. - The entire country is talking about sex, murders and wash and weird-wolf. This is just what the papers have been waiting for. Did you see this article this morning Times? Articles like that are appearing in every newspaper in every city, in the country. - [Military Man] I think we oughta crucify 'em. - [Attorney General] The networks, they can't even control their own people anymore. That circus of hippies outside the White House is getting bigger and bigger and bigger. (Military Men chattering) - Congress is threatening you with impeachment proceedings. I am afraid of complete civil disorder. My recommendation is that we declare martial law. (camera snapping) Put a curfew on the whole city. (camera snapping) And bring the army in on this. (camera snapping) - [Military Man] The army? - I think we should hold off on that. Gentlemen? Gentlemen, I'd like to come directly to the point. I would like to be able to announce the withdrawal of all troops totally and immediately in Southeast Asia but frankly, I'm afraid of the reaction from the lunatic right. General Dorocha, excuse me, General, Admiral. Admiral Dorocha, you are a politically astute tactician, well aware of the tensions on the home front. What could I do to keep those casualties here and abroad while I speed up truth, ur, troop withdrawals. - Sir, if we can make this one last quick thrust into his sanctuaries covered by reactive, protracted reconnaissance. An active radiative-- - Radiation. - [Admiral] Reconnaissance. - [Harry] What did I miss? - [President] Try to stay awake over there, Harry. - [Harry] Yes, sir. - A protective reactive reconnaissance an active-- - Okay, let's do it. - But, sir? - Huh? - [Attorney General] Don't you think we should notify Congress? - What about Congress? What do you think, Jack? Jack? (suspenseful music) Now, goddammit, let's, well let's just ignore them. Gentlemen, our credit is at stake. (dramatic music) Throughout the world. No, I will not be found wanting in this nuclear age. (men applauding) Just one more thing, gentlemen. About our plan to recognize red China. (men laughing) - Oh, Mr. President. - [Military Man] He's very cuter, isn't he? (President chuckling) (suspenseful music) (President muttering) Jack, what the hell time is it? Jack? Jack? Jack? Gentlemen, would you please excuse the boy. He hasn't been feeling too well recently. (motors humming) He's probably gone to the dispensary. (President laughing) (motors humming) (dramatic music) (gun firing) (werewolf sniffing) - Wait, wait. (werewolf sniffing) Wait! Wait! What is your name? What? What is your name? You have a name. What is your name? Tell me your name? What is your name? (werewolf snorting) (doctor chuckling) Are you real? Are you really real? (birds singing) (anxious music) - [Jack] My name is Whittier. I called earlier about some silver bullets. No, I want them with powder and tonight. All right, $500, I don't care. No, they don't have to be ballistically perfect. Well can you make one by tonight? All right, then send you one. (camera reel clicking) (projector clicking) - [President] Well if bullets won't stop it, maybe we can get it with the tank or a flame-thrower. - I don't want him destroyed under any circumstances. Don't you realize how important it is to our programs? You must issue the order that he be taken alive. - It's interesting, Dr. Kiss about the programs. Just what the hell are our scientific programs? - [Dr. Kiss] I haven't any more time for this. I have my own work to tend to. - [President] Well, it's pretty much the law. Word leaks out that there was a werewolf running around, I mean, we can't kill it. - [Dr. Kiss] Well, then, just don't let it. Only you and I have seen this. Let's keep all the people off the streets tonight and we'll handle it. - [President] I don't know about that, I'm up to my neck in this Asian policy stuff. And then the two students out in Ohio. - [Dr. Kiss] I respectfully submit, sir, that is your problem. - Oh, Dr. Kiss? (door knocking) Dr. Kiss? Dr. Kiss, what do you think of my Southeast Asian policy? Dr. Kiss? Oh. - Okay, Mrs. Captree. The publisher, the black kid, the guard at the Pentagon last night and this is the same shape as a scar on my shoulder. But just one night, could fill in the shape of the five pointed star. Another murder tonight at Watergate, my apartment. - And there's no doubt about it, the shoes we found at the Pentagon are his. - [Jack] And the shirt. - And the shirt. - If I can just catch a plane tomorrow, I'll have the full month to find that old gypsy woman before the full moon rises again. And Doctor, I know you... You can find a way to tell the president so that there won't be this search for me tonight or an investigation. (anxious music) But you have to lock me up tonight. - All right, I'm convinced. We'll lock you up. We can't let the press know about this. We can't let anybody know about it. - Yeah. There's no doubt the press would seize on your personal tragedy to discredit the President. - Well, frankly I don't even want him to know. He's got enough on his mind already. - Jack, I'm sorry about this. - Could you tell... - Marion? All right, I'll tell her. - I even think I'm might be able to get some rest tonight, knowing I'm chained up. Let's go. What's that? - It's a time lapse camera, Jack. Presumably it'll go on during the transformation. If you are what you say you are, we owe it to science to make a record of it. Oh and the president wants a copy for his new library. - Oh, Captain Salmon, would you turn on a television for me? I'd like to watch the President's addressed tonight. - [Announcer] Still angry over the-- - I have to leave soon, Jack, but I'll be back after the addresses is over. - I can't believe I have to go through another night of this agony. Captain Salmon, you see that cane? The cane right by the television set. Pick it up. Pick it up. And hit me with it. Hit me with it on the head. Kill me. I'm just a violent beast and I'm better off dead. I'm better off dead. - Jack? - I'm better off dead. Kill me, will ya? - Pull yourself together, Jack. Now there's nothing to whimper about. I guess this station will do, he's gonna be on all the stations. All right, Jack, I'll be back after the address. (anxious music) (clock ticking) (clock clicking) - Oh my god. - Marion? - Who did this to you, Jack? - No one did anything to me, Marion. Will you get outta here? - Are you insane? Who did this to you? - Marion, will you leave my chains alone? - Did you do this to yourself? - No, just leave 'em alone, Marion. Goddammit. Will you get outta here. Out, out! - Will you please stop barking at me. (Jack sobbing) Now, please stop that nonsense. - It's not nonsense, Marion. Please, will you leave before anything happens to you? - No, I'm not going to leave, of course not. In fact, I'm spending the night here. - What! - [Marion] So that you can see, this is all in your mind. - Oh, Marion, get the hell outta here! - [Marion] Don't worry, I'll leave your chain on. What's that? - Marion, just next to the T.V., there's a gun here, you see it? All right, it's loaded. Now if anything happens to me. If I change, that's the only thing that can keep me from killing someone else. - Oh, Jack, stop it. - Marion, if you insist on staying here, you could at least do that for me. Keep it with you at all times. Now you can do that for me, can't you, Marion? You can at least do that? (Jack sighing) (gentle music) (telephone ringing) Oh, don't answer it. - Hello. It's daddy. - Mr. President? - [President] Hi, Jack, I know I gave you a few days off, but it's just that the Press Secretary is ill, and I need you there. Well, I guess it's my most important address ever. I'm announcing a arms limitation agreement with the Chinese foreign minister. And I just don't want the public to think that it's a cover for the curfew I'm imposing upon Washington tonight. I don't wanna sound like a little boy who cried wolf. You know what I mean, Jack? What? Jack, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to insist. Yep, well, I've already sent a chopper over there to pick you up. Chopper. Yeah, heli-chopper, you know. (helicopter blades thumping) - [Jack] Mr. President, isn't that your helicopter over there? - [President] They're all by helicopters, Jack. - [Jack] Oh. (Mr. President laughing) - Hi, Solly, how you doing? Sit over there. Jack, sit over there. Well, this is a special occasion, Mister Prime Minister. It's the first time we've ever interrupted our nations television broadcasting for an unannounced press conference. Isn't that right, Jack? - [Prime Minister] I understand it comes at a very good time. Is it true that everybody in Washington is afraid of a werewolf? - Werewolf? (President laughing) No, no, I haven't heard that story. - [Prime Minister] Oh, is that so? (engine revving) I read a report of it in one of Hanoi papers. It sounded like a case of mass hysteria. (men laughing) - It sounds like an amusing report, Mr. Prime Minister. Jack, would you look into that? Jack? A werewolf (chuckles). (helicopter blades thumping) Jack? I haven't read any of those kind of papers. A werewolf. Now, Mr. Foreign Prime Minister, sir. We will introduce you to the nation and then I will come on next with-- - Hey. (speaking in foreign language) - No, Mr. Prime Minister, we are going to introduce you first to the nation. Oh, let's... (speaking in foreign language) Let's see, how do you say that in Chinese. Oh. (speaking in foreign language) You'll be the grabber, see. You'll get the people and then, then that'll raise a certain amount of speculation, Mr. Prime Minister and then I'll come on and that'll give the people what they've been waiting for. Do you understand? I come on. I come on. Mr. Prime minister, you're not listening. Mr. Prime Minister? (speaking in foreign language) Do you understand, Mr. Prime Minister? - [Prime Minister] I don't understand at all. - Then I come on and I-- - I'm not talking about this. Hey, this is not the thing I want. I don't want him here. - What? Just leave Jack out of this, you just talk to me for a moment. What I'm talking about, Mr. Prime Minister-- - [Prime Minister] Let's talk about this first, I don't wanna see him here. - Mr. Prime Minister, please pay attention here for just a moment. Jack, Jack, will you pay attention too? Goddammit. (speaking in foreign language) - You think it joke? Or is it war? - Oh, no, no. (speaking in foreign language) - It's no joke, Mr. Prime Minister. No war, of course. (yelling in foreign language) - Hey, Jack, please just help me out a little bit, will ya? (speaking in foreign language) You know? (speaking in foreign language) - What, I don't understand what you said. - Jack, Jack. - But, I do know what you're talking about. - Jack, Jack, would you pay just a little attention over here, Jack. - No, Jack. This is hi-jack! Hi-jack! - No, no. - Hi-jack! - No, no, there's no hijack, Mr. Prime Minister. No, no, hijack. (speaking in foreign language) You go before the nation-- - No more. No more (speaking in foreign language). I go! (speaking in foreign language) (suspenseful music) I go, I go. - No, no, don't get off here. No, no, don't get off here. We have to land, sir. Land, land. Now, Jack, how do you say land? Oh, Jack, will you please try to pay some attention over here. Mr. Prime Minister, after we announce you... (werewolf growling) (anxious music) Jack, you were right. It is you! (Prime Minister yelling) - Jack! Down, boy. (werewolf growling) Down, Jack. No, don't shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot. Don't, don't harm the dog. Jack, down, Jack. (dramatic music) (werewolf growling) Listen to your president talking here. Now, sit, boy, sit! Heel, Jack. Heel. (werewolf growling) Solly, Solly! Solly, get this plane outta the sky. Ah, Solly! (President yelling) (werewolf growling) (dramatic music) (men yelling) - Don't shoot, don't shoot. Get him, get him. (werewolf growling) (gun firing) I said, don't shoot! Medic, get a doctor over here, quick. All right, all right, keep back. He may be the President, but he's still a human being. - It was Jack Whittier. - My god. Marion. (President panting) - I just wanted to make one thing perfectly clear. Just, just... I said, so sorry. (werewolf howling) - Jack? Jack, is that you? (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (Marion screaming) (werewolf growling) (crockery shattering) (Marion sobbing) (Marion screaming) (werewolf growling) (werewolf howling) (gun firing) (werewolf groaning) (dramatic music) (Marion sobbing) (Marion screaming) - [Attorney General] Marion? (sorrowful music) (Marion sobbing) - [Salmon] It's all right, it's all right. (suspenseful music) - Oh, good god. It was Whittier. - Oh, Jack! - Al? - Jack, I didn't know. - Get Marion outta here. - Jack! - [Attorney General] I don't want press to know she's here. (Marion sobbing) - [Marion] Jack! Jack, Jack! Jack! - Now if this gets out. - What gets out, General? He's changed back. Who's to say any of us saw what we saw. - An autopsy, we'll have an autopsy. No, no, no, my mind, it's playing tricks on me. Listen, we'll give him a hero's burial. He became... He came between a sniper's bullet and the President's daughter. - Yeah. - You trace this gun, find out who the owner is. No, no bury it, bury it, bury it with last year's nerve gas. - The President's going to be all right. He just has a little bite on the neck. - Thank God. Al? Tell Marion her father is gonna be... Oh, nevermind. Well, you guys won't have Jack Whittier to kick around anymore. (werewolves howling) (anxious music) - [President] My fellow Americans. This is your President speaking to you from the White House. First, I want to thank you for your letters and telegrams offering me your best wishes during my recent illness. Secondly, I know I can count on your support as I lash out against the enemies of America, both in the press, as well as the Senate, Republicans as well as Democrats, white as well as black, who have circulated the vicious rumors holding members of my administration responsible for the recent and tragic deaths of just a few of my political opponents. At night, I roam the silent empty corridors of this great house, wrestling with my conscience. And I've come to this conclusion. If I'm to prevent our enemies from destroying not me but the very office of the presidency, I must have your support. And so... And so... And so... (werewolf growling) And so... (werewolf growling) (werewolf howling) (suspenseful music) - [Jack] That it could happen in America. That it could happen now. That it could ever happen to me. Jack Whittier Whittier is my name. Maybe you remember my byline. I was the youngest member of the Washington Press Corps. It's fastest rising star. One of the best and brightest as we used to say. Before so much blood passed under those pretty Potomac bridges. I was having an affair with the president's daughter and I wanted out, without hurting her feelings or frankly, my career. So I had my paper reassign me to our bureau in Budapest. Somehow the President heard I was banished for been too pro administration and he offered me a job, which I couldn't refuse. Which is where the terrible events that were to destroy my career and my life begin. - [Giselle] I bought it, it's silhouette. I found it in a little shop. I didn't think there were such thing left. - What's it for? - [Giselle] You mean, you don't know? (birds singing) - [Jack] Honest to God, Giselle, I'll have you leave Washington within six weeks. I'll get you a visa. I'll get you a job. - [Giselle] I don't want a job. A job with who. The FBI? - [Jack] Stop it, Giselle, now will you come on? (car engine humming) (car horn hooting) (tires screeching) (crickets chirping) Hey, fella, what do you think you're doing? You trying to get somebody killed? You rammed me right into the tree. What are you doing, standing here, right in the middle of the road? What are you psyched or something? What's the matter, can't you speak English? Giselle, will you get back in the car, I gotta make it to the airport. (car door slamming) (car engine sputtering) (car door slamming) I'm sorry, sir. I just, I lost my temper. But my car won't start and I have to catch a plane. That's very important. Do you know, is there a gas station around or someone that could help me? (bike bashing) Hey... It won't start. Hey, mister! I really need help! How do you say... (speaking in foreign language) Come on. (speaking in foreign language) Now please, the only I'm asking you is because my car crashed because of him. Now could you just give me a little help, please? (speaking in foreign language) I'm dying to hear this one. - She said, if we want to leave, then leave. - Then leave, we can't leave! Goddammit! I told him my car is stuck. (speaking in foreign language) It's over there by the-- (yelling in foreign language) Listen, it's because of him, its all his fault. He ran me off the road. (car door slamming) - [Giselle] Come on. - [Jack] What are you afraid of, we don't have to go anywhere. It cost me 15 hundred million dollar for the man of the year. (car engine roaring) What are you looking at? Were you looking at Giselle? Not you. (Jack yelling) Hey, what's the matter with you? Hey, come on and check it, will ya? (crickets chirping) There's gotta be a house down that road where I can get a phone. Just wait for me here, Giselle. Leave the headlights on, okay. - [Giselle] Okay. (car door slamming) (wolf howling) (suspenseful music) - [Man] There, there. - Over there? - Yes. - All right, fine. Is it far? - Yes. - Long distance? It's far? - Yes, yes, it is far. - How far? - Not too much. - Oh, good, I can walk. - No, not tonight, come in. - Do you know what time? The departure schedule of the train? - The moon, moon. Come in. - What the? - Not tonight, please. - No, thank you, I'm in a hurry. - Come in, come in. - What are you afraid of? (door banging) Giselle? Giselle? (wolf howling) (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (crickets chirping) Giselle? (wolf howling) (dramatic music) (wolf growling) (wolf yelping) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) - And so, it must have been a wolf. We could find no corpse. - Oh, come on. I killed a man and I killed him with this thing. - You said it was an accident, my boy. - I was an accident. But are you gonna take my word for it? Aren't you going to detain me? - The Inspector has already looked, his car and his driver. - What's going on here? This country is crawling with bureaucrats. Where are they? Why aren't the here questioning us? - [Giselle] Jack, they are willing to let go us. Let's go. - What are you trying to cover up? Is the White House behind this? - The what house? - The White House. - It isn't him, don't even know what are you saying. (train whistle blowing) (speaking in foreign language) - What'd she say? - [Giselle] She says, you are feverish. It was after one. - I'm afraid I must ask you to leave the area at once. I tell you again, no one has been reported missing. No corpse has been found. If you continue to make a nuisance of yourself, I shall have you locked up. - How come you speak English? Huh? (car engine chugging) (crickets chirping) That was your son that I killed, wasn't it? (speaking in foreign language) - Yes, that was her son. - And you don't even care that I killed him? (speaking in foreign language) - She says, you didn't kill him. You released him. He needed to die. He longed to rest. - Because of the communist? Secret police? (speaking in foreign language) - The pentagram. - Because of the sign of the the pentagram. - Ah, the Pentagon is behind all of this. - The pentagram. The mark of the beast. This. - Oh, that's just a bunch of insanity. (speaking in foreign language) - Whoever is bitten by a werewolf and live, becomes a werewolf himself. - Oh, bull. Find out who she's working for. (speaking in foreign language) - The wolf bit you, didn't he? - Yes, dammit. (speaking in foreign language) (suspenseful music) - [Jack] Wear this charm over your heart always. And remember, a werewolf can only be killed with a silver bullet or a stick with a silver handle. (speaking in foreign language) - [Jack] Heaven help you, my son. (gentle music) (toilet flushing) (door knocking) - [Woman] Jack? The President wants to see you. He's in my bedroom. (guests chattering) - We worked for everything we had. And you know, we had a deed from the King of England for our property in Maryland. And now Larnies kids want to come and they wanna give it to the communist, just give it. Isn't the right, Maurice? I mean, you agree with me, don't you, honey? Well, Vaughn, aren't you going to do something about it? - We're gonna change the constitution. - Oh, thank heaven. Well, I meant to say, you should rewrite it. And I think I have a few points... (door knocking) - Jack, come in, come in. Good to see you, Jack. - Mr. President. - Yeah, you're looking fine, just fine. Ur, settle it any way you want to. Just make sure it doesn't fall back on my lap or the Attorney Generals. How was your flight, Jack? - I mean, I think Washington is going to be quite a come-down in many ways. I'm gonna have to sell my stock. - Even though you're my Press Aid, your job will deal mainly with the Justice Department. The Attorney General is just too honest for his own good. Need to help restore his image with the press. And also deal with the Captree nomination. Especially the Captree nomination. Have you met Mrs. Captree? - It doesn't matter, if Elliot looses the nomination, we'll just be mighty happy to stay home and make money, won't we? (group laughing) - [Jack] No, sir. - She's gonna be a problem. How do you tell a man to dump his wife for the good of his country? (President chuckling) Well, anyway. I want to restore some balance in the court. With a Southerner, we could give them a sense of belonging down there. Goddammit, you know what that means, Jack? - I think I do, sir, yes. - Now, that's all the speech I have for now. But we'll talk some more later. Have you seen Marion yet? I don't understand you young people. She's seeing a nice young man nowadays. You should get to know him. He's a phychiatrist. A Naval psychiatrist. I think you'd like him. - And Senator Bod, does not represent the people of Maryland. (gasps) Hello there, Mr. President. You know, I was just telling the Attorney General here that Senator Bob, oh, he makes me so sick. I just can't stand it. - Mrs. Captree, I'm sure your husband doesn't even feel that strongly about it. - [Mr. Captree] Why, thank you, Mr. President. - Jack, you see the kind of problems we have here. Judge, I want you to meet Jack Whittier the new Assistant Press Secretary. - [Mr. Captree] How do you do? - And Mrs. Captree. - Oh, is he the Jewish young man that you hired to muzzle me? (Mrs. Captree laughing) - No, I'm afraid. - Oh, well, you look smart. - [President] I'm going to excuse myself now. - You sleep tight now, Mr. President. - [President] Oh, Marion. - Hello, Jack. - My, that Marion's such a lovely girl. Did the Washington Times really send you to Siberia, socking the truth to them, Mr. Whittier? - It was Hungary. - What? - Hung-- - Come on, Margie. I think it's time we left for home too. - Oh, no, Eliot honey. Well, why don't you run along like you always do. I'm sure this nice young man will see me home. Won't you, honey? - Certainly, Ma'am. (suspenseful music) (gentle music) I think your father's a cross between Abraham Lincoln and Jesus Christ. - I'm engaged to be married, Jack. - Already? To that psychiatrist guy? (suspenseful music) (gentle music) Mrs. Captree, are you ready-- - Oh, I'm just having one for the road. Oh. You know, anytime you have people marching in the streets, you're just catering to a revolution. You know what my husband says? Well, my husband said many times that he actually prefers some of the Russian communist. The liberal communists in this country. What's the matter with my hand? - Huh? Oh, nothing. (gentle music) - Goodness, my, Jack. You're just a devil, aren't ya? (suspenseful music) - [Salmon] Hi, good evening, hiya. I thought I'd come over and say good evening to you. - Well, hi. - Commander Salmon. Why don't you come in and talk to me sometime, Jack? We'll have a talk. - All right, sure. - Now, where were we? Where were we? We were saying something about... (suspenseful music) (Mrs. Captree humming) (animal growling) (Mrs. Captree humming) (animal growling) (Mrs. Captree screaming) - I watched the damn thing myself, they didn't have a, they didn't even have a station break. And this prejudice hostile critic as the commentator they put on, right after the President's address about Captree. Well, I have the networks work, they're gonna bury this guy someplace. - [Jack] What do you mean? - Give him the ax, drop it. - [Jack] You're kidding? - No, the President is fed up with this guy's facial expressions and gestures. We've got some friends there. It's the other networks I'm worried about. Here, take a look at the speech the Vice President is gonna read tomorrow night. (woman screaming) (hand slapping) We are going to war against the networks, Jack. We're going to win back the minds and hearts of the American people. And we have got to have Captree on that court to win the fight or we're in trouble. Hell, you understand that. Hey, look, Jack, there's a line in there, we had trouble with, something about the views of a small group, the small, how does small strike you? That's a little soft. What would you call your compatriots at the press if you wanted to be, you know, more flashy? - Ur... Let's see. Well at their worst coterie of impudent snobs (laughs). Or nobody really-- - That's good. No, that's great. We'll use it. - [Jack] You're kidding? - No, it's just what we want. Look, the man told me to give you a draft of the speech and listen to your suggestions on it. Now I know why. I want you to spice it up a bit, huh? - Well, I don't know. I mean, I wouldn't use that line I just suggested. - Why not? That is exactly what we want. (telephone ringing) Not now! Yeah. My God. What's this country coming to? Mrs. Captree was just found dead. Guts ripped open. (woman screaming) (gentle music) - How have you been? I guess I asked that last night. - Yeah, I guess you did. Gee, I hadn't been in the White House in a long time. - Well, not everyone get to see all of the White House, Jack. - Well, I'm supposed to meet with your father. - It's really awful about Mrs. Captree, isn't it? And those shoes they found, that's weird. - Shoes? Giselle, um, Marion... The President's waiting for me. I better not keep him. - Hasn't Judge Captree asked that his nomination be withdrawn because of this horrible tragedy? - I've asked him not to make that request. Frankly, I don't want his name withdrawn. The current permissive trends continue in this country. I'm worried about national anarchy. Andrea, you and I, we don't see eye to eye about most things. Never asked me to support and I've never received it. (suspenseful music) But if your paper could change its position, it would swing the nomination for him. - I'll think about it, Mr. President. - Good. I'm sorry to have kept you here so late. Oh, by the way, I have asked the FCC to act as quickly as possible to file that application. No matter what position you take. After all I do owe you a favor. If you hadn't banished Jack here to Budapest, well, I wouldn't have a new Assistant Press Secretary. Oh, evening, darling. - Mr. President, we didn't banish Jack, I begged him to stay here. Didn't I, Jack? He requested the transfer for personal reasons and he's welcome to come back anytime. - Thank you. (suspenseful music) - Jack? - Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. I have to go, Mr. President, I'll see you tomorrow. - I'll leave with Jack. - No! - Jack, um-- - No, I mean I'll stay here with you, Mr. President. - I'll help you get over, Mr. President. I may surprise you. - Oh, thank you, Andrea. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, Jack. Goodnight, Marion. - Jack, Jack? Jack, I think I could be a friend, Jack. If you could just accept that. I'd like to be. You don't look well, Jack. (door slamming) Jack? - [Jack] Don't wait for me there, Marion. Wait for me in your room. Go away, now! (wolf howling) (door rattling) - Jack? (door rattling) Jack? (car engine humming) - [Andrea] Hello? Hello? (werewolf growling) (werewolf panting) (werewolf growling) (woman screaming) (dramatic music) (tires screeching) - Says it's a werewolf. - A weird wolf? - A werewolf. Werewolf. Can you imagine what happened if the press gets a hold of that? I think the kid did themself. - He looks like he could sever a jugular. - Well, I don't think the kid did it. - Now, maybe he did do it. His obvious hatred of female authority figures. The expression he keeps using, mother. Now it fits the pattern of the crimes. Prominent middle aged women found near National Monuments. - [Jack] Well, I don't think the kid did it. - You're the whiz kid. You keep it from the press. - Hi, how are ya? Could you just tell me exactly what you saw? - Look with just all this figure running away. - A figure running away? Was it a man or a woman, was it light or dark. Well, was it light or dark? - It was too dark to tell. - The figure was dark, wasn't it? This figure was dark? - All right, it was dark, it was very dark. - Debbie, Debbie, just be cool. - A black man? - No, it was a werewolf, you racist pig. - Oh, just one minute-- - Now, don't point your finger at me. - Who you talking to? - I'm not lying. - Take it easy, take it easy. - Look, we didn't do anything. - Take it easy. Now, could you kids tell me something more detail about this running figure? - It was hairy. It walked funny. - Uh-huh? - The Panthers. - [Jack] How do you know it's the Panthers? - I know it! Book 'em. - Book 'em? Wait a minute, what for? - Narcotics. - Oh no. Now wait a minute, now listen. (Jack whispering) Where you kids staying? - At the Chevrolet Hilton. - The what? (woman laughing) - Big bus on the mall. - I'm just trying to help you. We're going to assign an FBI agent to keep you under surveillance or else we're gonna have to lock you up. - Oh, wow, man. - Thank you. - [Jack] Huh? - You stay with 'em. - Well, sir, do you have any leads, I mean, this is the second murder of a national known figure in two days. Are you sure you have enough manpower to trap the killer? I mean, your boys seem to be busy with the networks. - Let me tell you something. None of this would've happened if you people didn't support the very elements in our society that did this. - Easy, easy, don't let them get to you. - How do you know that we support the elements when you don't have one single lead? - We do have a suspect. And an indictment is imminent. - Sir, I must insist that you stop talking to these people. - Does imminent mean today, tomorrow or indefinitely, sir? - Imminent means tomorrow morning, nine o'clock. - I'm sorry, sir-- - And won't you bleeding hearts be surprised? - He doesn't have one indictment. He's too busy investigating us. - You see, see! Jack? Jack? (suspenseful music) - [President] This is another one of our washrooms. I don't suppose you asked about anything this convenient on this level. - No, sir. (man laughing) - I guess not. I understand that the three of you are cooped up on one of these for how long is that? - It's about two weeks all together, sir. - Two weeks. - Sir, you mind if I? - Oh, no, no, you go right ahead. - Oh, this thing doesn't work. - Huh? Oh, let me give you a hand. (door rattling) Oh, that's strange. - That's all right, sir, I'll use this one. - No, no, no, that's not the point. (door banging) That's odd? (door banging) Nobody in there. (door banging) I'll just reach down under it and get the latch for you. - Sir, I'll do in just a second. - No, no, no, no. (anxious music) (door banging) You just go about your business. (door banging) I'll get the janitor to look at that. (toilet flushing) You know, it's odd, we had one of you fellas up on the moon, but when it comes to fix an old latch like that, we're just all thumbs. Oh, good, there's a Remington I wanna show you out here, that Blackwoods gave to me a few years back. (door thumping) (door clicking) Oh, just hold it there. Don't wanna forget this. Two weeks. The three. - [Astronaut] Two weeks. (door thumping) (dramatic music) - [Jack] God. - I can only give you a minute, but I'd like you to stay and see the Senator. - Mr. President, I'm not feeling very well. Do you think you might want to find someone to replace me. - You mean, right now? Well, sure, go ahead, take a nap, Jack. - No, I mean, generally, sir. - Come on, Jack, you're doing a fine job. You're indispensable to me. I need you to now more than ever. - It's about those shoes, sir. - Shoes? - Yeah. - What shoes? Jack, would you please stop scratching the palms of your hands? It's just not manly. - It's about the murders, sir. I don't believe that the Panthers did them. - Oh, there hasn't been a murder since we put a guard of that black boy. - But the moon has arisen yet. Put a guard on me. (radio commentator speaking) - Damn that mob out there. (hand banging) Now look, Jack. What is the meaning of this? That speech you wrote last night was just great. The networks, they don't know what hit them. And it's all because of you. I wanna assign you full-time to writing speeches for the Vice President. - Mr. President... I think I'm... I think I'm a... (door clicking) I think I'm a werewolf. - The Senator, Mr. President. - What? - The Senator. - Speak up, goddammit, I can't hear you. - The Senator, Mr. President. - Oh, send her in. - [Commentator] Throw it up for grabs, as he threw it up, that... (T.V. clicking) - Now, Jack, we all get disturbed at some time or another over some damn little thing. But I won't hear of you leaving the team till you've had a chat with Commander Salmon. All right? - Mr. President? Hello? - Oh, Joan, it's good to see you. Come in, come in. - I'm a murderer. (suspenseful music) I killed someone last night. Dr. Salmon, do you believe that a man can change into an animal? - An animal? - Have you ever heard of the mark of the beast? - What? - There's a curse on me. I was bitten by a wolf. Only it wasn't a wolf. - Only, it wasn't a wolf. - It was a werewolf. And now, when the full moon rises, I change into an animal with only one desire. The desire to kill. - [Dr. Salmon] Oh, Jack, really, werewolf. Thank you. - Well, what about my blackouts? And my scar, and my finger? And what about those shoes? - I think you're in trouble, Jack, but not the kind of trouble you're think you're in. - What about my seeing the sign of a pentagram? - Well, sometimes we see our conflicts in terms of political symbols. - Well, what's politics gotta do with this. - Well, what does the Pentagon have to do with it? - The pentagram. - Gentlemen. - The five-pointed star. - [Waiter] Are you ready to order dinner now? - Doctor, would you come to the bathroom with me? - [Waiter] Later, sir. - Please. Come with me to the bathroom. - [Dr. Salmon] Later. - Would you, please? - What for? - I must show you something. - Show me here. - It's on my chest. - All right. Jack, I don't wanna talk about your symptoms now but they're not very hard to explain. Now you feel guilty because you were with both of these women when they were killed. - You know think that in itself is strange? - And you have the feeling that you could've done something to stop it. Coupled with guilt feelings for having murderous-- - [Jack] Well, look at this. - Guilt feelings for having murderous wishes towards these women over evil reasons for both of which you want to be punished. - Will you look at this. - So? - I saw this in the palm of each of my victims. - Jack, I want to help you. - Well then, lock me up. - Come over to the hospital tomorrow and we'll talk it over. - But someone's gonna die tonight! - [Man] Will you two faggots, shut up! - Now, Jack, I cannot help you unless you really want me to help you. Now remember what I told you. - Jack Whittier on the line for Cliff Napes. Cliff? Jack, fine. A little favor. Now looked, who would I talk to over there to find out if someone from Budapest is a red dart? Maybe Chinese. G-I-S-E-L-L-E, Frennik, F-R-E-N-N-I-K. French Romanian, about 30. Correspondent for the Budapest House Oregon. (telephone ringing) Jack Whittier? Hi, angel. Dr. Salmon? Yes I did. (Jack sighing) But now he has me thinking that whatever was bothering me was all in my mind. (suspenseful music) No, no. Oh, no, that's just between me and my analyst. (dramatic music) Yeah, I'm fitting all the pieces together. I'm beginning to think that while I was in Budapest, I was brainwashed or something. Yeah, to cover up so political activities here. (suspenseful music) It's some issues. No. What? You want to come over here? Tonight? (Jack chuckling) I just hope your secret service man never publishes a book. Why, sure, sure, come over. I don't know, maybe you'd better not. (Jack sobbing) Oh, god, please, don't let me go through this again. (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (werewolf growling) (werewolf panting) (glass shattering) - [Woman] Hey, we're going for a walk. - Good idea, let's go. - Oh, man, without you, you know, we wanna make it. You know what I mean, don't you, make it? Do it. - We got small steps. - No, man, we wanna take a walk. Could you stay behind you, you know like 100 paces? - No, seriously, I wanna make a phone call, mister, ur... - Murphy, Randy Murphy. - I'm gonna go call Sally, okay? - Yeah, man. (coin jingling) - Information? Yeah. Randy Murphy, he's somewhere in Georgetown, I think. Yeah. Right. Thank you. (coin jingling) (telephone dialing) Hello, Mrs. Murphy? This the werewolf of Washington. (woman growling) I know just what you want. (woman growling) - Are they in or? - No, no. I left a message, they'll be back later. (suspenseful music) - [Man] Well, are you ready to go? Look, come on, let's... (werewolf growling) (woman screaming) - [Woman] Why are you taking pictures? (werewolf growling) (woman screaming) Please! (werewolf growling) (woman screaming) (werewolf growling) (werewolf growling) (woman screaming) (woman screaming) (werewolf growling) (woman screaming) (werewolf growling) (gun firing) (werewolf growling) (gun firing) (woman sobbing) - Mr. President? - Mr. President? - Ladies and gentlemen, before I answer your questions I would like to make a brief announcement. I have called this conference because of the mass hysteria and now tragedy surrounding a case that we're all very much aware of. Aware of. Today, I'm pleased to announce the indictment of... (President coughing) Secondly, the anarchist must be punished. And thirdly-- - [Reporter] I think he's messing it up. - We must have Captree on the Supreme Court. If he so threatens of people, they will stop at nothing. (President coughing) Questions? - [Reporters] Mr. President? - Mr. President? - Yes? - Sir, is it true that the same black man you are holding for murder, was himself brutally attacked last night? - No, I didn't point at you. I was pointing at her. Her. - Mr. President? The Vice President made a speech last night, I was wondering if he would comment on it. - Yes, I'm glad you asked that question. I would like to make one thing perfectly clear. (chair thumping) The Vice President does not clear his speeches with me. (President laughing) - [Reporters] Mr. President? - Is the conference over? - No. I just had to leave. - You know, I tried calling you last night after you hung up. Where were you? (suspenseful music) - [Jack] Did you? Where was I? I don't know. - I'm sorry to interrupt, but the colored... The black kid died. - I don't care what it is your going through, son. Commander Salmon assures me that you're problems will not interfere with your job, and that's good enough for me. - But I don't think Dr. Salmon-- - Wait, wait. Wait, Jack, wait. (bowling ball rumbling) (President laughing) Ah, look at that. Now, Jack. - Sir. - I don't care what this gypsy lady told you. Commander Salmon tells me that in your case, or let me say that in this case, the existence of a werewolf has not been verified. So how could you be a werewolf? - Well, sir-- - Where's the ball? Where's the damn ball? - Sir? - Take off your shoes, or get in gutter. - [Jack] I've gotta let you know a little secret. - You know this is not, but I get frightened too. (President groaning) I like you, Jack. I really do. Here, like the son I never had. I see a lot of myself in you. I see you going places, Jack and I'd like to be part of it. There it is, coming up down there. - [Jack] Mr. President, tonight when the moon is full-- - Tonight when the moon is full. Got a hold of yourself, boy. (President muttering) You're just going through a crisis. I know about crisis. You run from this one, you run into the next one. Jack, where did you go to school? - University of Chicago, sir. - You play any ball there? - Just four-ball handball, sir. They didn't have varsity sports. - I swear, there's nothing wrong with four-ball handball. Here, here, listen, I want you to take a ball. I want you to bowl a few balls with me. Go on, take a ball and go over to that alleyway, over there. Just pick it up and step over there, that's it. Jack, I want you to watch this. Watch me, Jack. - Yes. - Watch me. Here we go. (bowling ball rumbling) (pins crashing) (President laughing) Look at that shot. Go ahead, you take a shot, go ahead, go ahead. (suspenseful music) Go ahead, come on, take a shot. This morning vote for Senate, let me have the man I want in the Supreme Court. You think I don't care about that, huh? Do you? Take your position, come on. Get up the line there, that's it. (Jack sighing) Now, I can show you how to have a good time. Time for testing and soul searching. I'll strike out at my enemy, swiftly and boldly. Maybe even tonight. Play, boy. Jack? - Yes. - Throw the ball. - I'm sorry. - No, not like that. Here, look, get down. On your knees. On your knees, on your knees. Bend your knees. - Yes, sir. - Ah, that's it. Now we have the ball back and we're just gonna let it rip down the ally. Right, that's it, get the ball, right there. Get your hands down there. - Yes. - And when you get the ball like this, let it whiz, let it go. You think I'll run from a battle? Jack, will you throw the ball, throw the ball down there. - Yes, sir. - I went to, shoot now. (drowned out by sighing) miss the target completely. Oh, son, only a few of us left in the boat now. Got to stick together and play for one another. I believe in you, Jack. I want you to believe in me. I promise to stand by you in this crisis, Jack, if you'll promise me that you'll stand by yourself. Jack, throw the ball, for Christ sake. - I can't, sir. - Why, sure you can, just throw it. - No, I can't, I've been trying to tell you. - Jack, what kind of a man are you, anyway? - I've been trying to tell you, sir. The first thing happens, my fingers start to swell before the moon rises. And now my fingers are stuck in the ball, I can't get it off. - Okay, Jack. I have a meeting in the War Room, please. - I can't go. - Jack, look, Commander Salmon will be there, everybody will be fine. - I'm stuck in the ball! - Give me that goddam ball. Pull! (men grunting) Nothing wrong with that ball. Nothing at all. - [Military Man] You see, these pilots load up their planes with bombs flying 'em anywhere that you want, drop 'em anywhere they want, without any authorization. They're so damn incorrigible. And then it drops in our lap. And we don't hear about it, till we read it in the papers. Well, I'm fed up with been a nice entire country. - The entire country is talking about sex, murders and wash and weird-wolf. This is just what the papers have been waiting for. Did you see this article this morning Times? Articles like that are appearing in every newspaper in every city, in the country. - [Military Man] I think we oughta crucify 'em. - [Attorney General] The networks, they can't even control their own people anymore. That circus of hippies outside the White House is getting bigger and bigger and bigger. (Military Men chattering) - Congress is threatening you with impeachment proceedings. I am afraid of complete civil disorder. My recommendation is that we declare martial law. (camera snapping) Put a curfew on the whole city. (camera snapping) And bring the army in on this. (camera snapping) - [Military Man] The army? - I think we should hold off on that. Gentlemen? Gentlemen, I'd like to come directly to the point. I would like to be able to announce the withdrawal of all troops totally and immediately in Southeast Asia but frankly, I'm afraid of the reaction from the lunatic right. General Dorocha, excuse me, General, Admiral. Admiral Dorocha, you are a politically astute tactician, well aware of the tensions on the home front. What could I do to keep those casualties here and abroad while I speed up truth, ur, troop withdrawals. - Sir, if we can make this one last quick thrust into his sanctuaries covered by reactive, protracted reconnaissance. An active radiative-- - Radiation. - [Admiral] Reconnaissance. - [Harry] What did I miss? - [President] Try to stay awake over there, Harry. - [Harry] Yes, sir. - A protective reactive reconnaissance an active-- - Okay, let's do it. - But, sir? - Huh? - [Attorney General] Don't you think we should notify Congress? - What about Congress? What do you think, Jack? Jack? (suspenseful music) Now, goddammit, let's, well let's just ignore them. Gentlemen, our credit is at stake. (dramatic music) Throughout the world. No, I will not be found wanting in this nuclear age. (men applauding) Just one more thing, gentlemen. About our plan to recognize red China. (men laughing) - Oh, Mr. President. - [Military Man] He's very cuter, isn't he? (President chuckling) (suspenseful music) (President muttering) Jack, what the hell time is it? Jack? Jack? Jack? Gentlemen, would you please excuse the boy. He hasn't been feeling too well recently. (motors humming) He's probably gone to the dispensary. (President laughing) (motors humming) (dramatic music) (gun firing) (werewolf sniffing) - Wait, wait. (werewolf sniffing) Wait! Wait! What is your name? What? What is your name? You have a name. What is your name? Tell me your name? What is your name? (werewolf snorting) (doctor chuckling) Are you real? Are you really real? (birds singing) (anxious music) - [Jack] My name is Whittier. I called earlier about some silver bullets. No, I want them with powder and tonight. All right, $500, I don't care. No, they don't have to be ballistically perfect. Well can you make one by tonight? All right, then send you one. (camera reel clicking) (projector clicking) - [President] Well if bullets won't stop it, maybe we can get it with the tank or a flame-thrower. - I don't want him destroyed under any circumstances. Don't you realize how important it is to our programs? You must issue the order that he be taken alive. - It's interesting, Dr. Kiss about the programs. Just what the hell are our scientific programs? - [Dr. Kiss] I haven't any more time for this. I have my own work to tend to. - [President] Well, it's pretty much the law. Word leaks out that there was a werewolf running around, I mean, we can't kill it. - [Dr. Kiss] Well, then, just don't let it. Only you and I have seen this. Let's keep all the people off the streets tonight and we'll handle it. - [President] I don't know about that, I'm up to my neck in this Asian policy stuff. And then the two students out in Ohio. - [Dr. Kiss] I respectfully submit, sir, that is your problem. - Oh, Dr. Kiss? (door knocking) Dr. Kiss? Dr. Kiss, what do you think of my Southeast Asian policy? Dr. Kiss? Oh. - Okay, Mrs. Captree. The publisher, the black kid, the guard at the Pentagon last night and this is the same shape as a scar on my shoulder. But just one night, could fill in the shape of the five pointed star. Another murder tonight at Watergate, my apartment. - And there's no doubt about it, the shoes we found at the Pentagon are his. - [Jack] And the shirt. - And the shirt. - If I can just catch a plane tomorrow, I'll have the full month to find that old gypsy woman before the full moon rises again. And Doctor, I know you... You can find a way to tell the president so that there won't be this search for me tonight or an investigation. (anxious music) But you have to lock me up tonight. - All right, I'm convinced. We'll lock you up. We can't let the press know about this. We can't let anybody know about it. - Yeah. There's no doubt the press would seize on your personal tragedy to discredit the President. - Well, frankly I don't even want him to know. He's got enough on his mind already. - Jack, I'm sorry about this. - Could you tell... - Marion? All right, I'll tell her. - I even think I'm might be able to get some rest tonight, knowing I'm chained up. Let's go. What's that? - It's a time lapse camera, Jack. Presumably it'll go on during the transformation. If you are what you say you are, we owe it to science to make a record of it. Oh and the president wants a copy for his new library. - Oh, Captain Salmon, would you turn on a television for me? I'd like to watch the President's addressed tonight. - [Announcer] Still angry over the-- - I have to leave soon, Jack, but I'll be back after the addresses is over. - I can't believe I have to go through another night of this agony. Captain Salmon, you see that cane? The cane right by the television set. Pick it up. Pick it up. And hit me with it. Hit me with it on the head. Kill me. I'm just a violent beast and I'm better off dead. I'm better off dead. - Jack? - I'm better off dead. Kill me, will ya? - Pull yourself together, Jack. Now there's nothing to whimper about. I guess this station will do, he's gonna be on all the stations. All right, Jack, I'll be back after the address. (anxious music) (clock ticking) (clock clicking) - Oh my god. - Marion? - Who did this to you, Jack? - No one did anything to me, Marion. Will you get outta here? - Are you insane? Who did this to you? - Marion, will you leave my chains alone? - Did you do this to yourself? - No, just leave 'em alone, Marion. Goddammit. Will you get outta here. Out, out! - Will you please stop barking at me. (Jack sobbing) Now, please stop that nonsense. - It's not nonsense, Marion. Please, will you leave before anything happens to you? - No, I'm not going to leave, of course not. In fact, I'm spending the night here. - What! - [Marion] So that you can see, this is all in your mind. - Oh, Marion, get the hell outta here! - [Marion] Don't worry, I'll leave your chain on. What's that? - Marion, just next to the T.V., there's a gun here, you see it? All right, it's loaded. Now if anything happens to me. If I change, that's the only thing that can keep me from killing someone else. - Oh, Jack, stop it. - Marion, if you insist on staying here, you could at least do that for me. Keep it with you at all times. Now you can do that for me, can't you, Marion? You can at least do that? (Jack sighing) (gentle music) (telephone ringing) Oh, don't answer it. - Hello. It's daddy. - Mr. President? - [President] Hi, Jack, I know I gave you a few days off, but it's just that the Press Secretary is ill, and I need you there. Well, I guess it's my most important address ever. I'm announcing a arms limitation agreement with the Chinese foreign minister. And I just don't want the public to think that it's a cover for the curfew I'm imposing upon Washington tonight. I don't wanna sound like a little boy who cried wolf. You know what I mean, Jack? What? Jack, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to insist. Yep, well, I've already sent a chopper over there to pick you up. Chopper. Yeah, heli-chopper, you know. (helicopter blades thumping) - [Jack] Mr. President, isn't that your helicopter over there? - [President] They're all by helicopters, Jack. - [Jack] Oh. (Mr. President laughing) - Hi, Solly, how you doing? Sit over there. Jack, sit over there. Well, this is a special occasion, Mister Prime Minister. It's the first time we've ever interrupted our nations television broadcasting for an unannounced press conference. Isn't that right, Jack? - [Prime Minister] I understand it comes at a very good time. Is it true that everybody in Washington is afraid of a werewolf? - Werewolf? (President laughing) No, no, I haven't heard that story. - [Prime Minister] Oh, is that so? (engine revving) I read a report of it in one of Hanoi papers. It sounded like a case of mass hysteria. (men laughing) - It sounds like an amusing report, Mr. Prime Minister. Jack, would you look into that? Jack? A werewolf (chuckles). (helicopter blades thumping) Jack? I haven't read any of those kind of papers. A werewolf. Now, Mr. Foreign Prime Minister, sir. We will introduce you to the nation and then I will come on next with-- - Hey. (speaking in foreign language) - No, Mr. Prime Minister, we are going to introduce you first to the nation. Oh, let's... (speaking in foreign language) Let's see, how do you say that in Chinese. Oh. (speaking in foreign language) You'll be the grabber, see. You'll get the people and then, then that'll raise a certain amount of speculation, Mr. Prime Minister and then I'll come on and that'll give the people what they've been waiting for. Do you understand? I come on. I come on. Mr. Prime minister, you're not listening. Mr. Prime Minister? (speaking in foreign language) Do you understand, Mr. Prime Minister? - [Prime Minister] I don't understand at all. - Then I come on and I-- - I'm not talking about this. Hey, this is not the thing I want. I don't want him here. - What? Just leave Jack out of this, you just talk to me for a moment. What I'm talking about, Mr. Prime Minister-- - [Prime Minister] Let's talk about this first, I don't wanna see him here. - Mr. Prime Minister, please pay attention here for just a moment. Jack, Jack, will you pay attention too? Goddammit. (speaking in foreign language) - You think it joke? Or is it war? - Oh, no, no. (speaking in foreign language) - It's no joke, Mr. Prime Minister. No war, of course. (yelling in foreign language) - Hey, Jack, please just help me out a little bit, will ya? (speaking in foreign language) You know? (speaking in foreign language) - What, I don't understand what you said. - Jack, Jack. - But, I do know what you're talking about. - Jack, Jack, would you pay just a little attention over here, Jack. - No, Jack. This is hi-jack! Hi-jack! - No, no. - Hi-jack! - No, no, there's no hijack, Mr. Prime Minister. No, no, hijack. (speaking in foreign language) You go before the nation-- - No more. No more (speaking in foreign language). I go! (speaking in foreign language) (suspenseful music) I go, I go. - No, no, don't get off here. No, no, don't get off here. We have to land, sir. Land, land. Now, Jack, how do you say land? Oh, Jack, will you please try to pay some attention over here. Mr. Prime Minister, after we announce you... (werewolf growling) (anxious music) Jack, you were right. It is you! (Prime Minister yelling) - Jack! Down, boy. (werewolf growling) Down, Jack. No, don't shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot. Don't, don't harm the dog. Jack, down, Jack. (dramatic music) (werewolf growling) Listen to your president talking here. Now, sit, boy, sit! Heel, Jack. Heel. (werewolf growling) Solly, Solly! Solly, get this plane outta the sky. Ah, Solly! (President yelling) (werewolf growling) (dramatic music) (men yelling) - Don't shoot, don't shoot. Get him, get him. (werewolf growling) (gun firing) I said, don't shoot! Medic, get a doctor over here, quick. All right, all right, keep back. He may be the President, but he's still a human being. - It was Jack Whittier. - My god. Marion. (President panting) - I just wanted to make one thing perfectly clear. Just, just... I said, so sorry. (werewolf howling) - Jack? Jack, is that you? (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (Marion screaming) (werewolf growling) (crockery shattering) (Marion sobbing) (Marion screaming) (werewolf growling) (werewolf howling) (gun firing) (werewolf groaning) (dramatic music) (Marion sobbing) (Marion screaming) - [Attorney General] Marion? (sorrowful music) (Marion sobbing) - [Salmon] It's all right, it's all right. (suspenseful music) - Oh, good god. It was Whittier. - Oh, Jack! - Al? - Jack, I didn't know. - Get Marion outta here. - Jack! - [Attorney General] I don't want press to know she's here. (Marion sobbing) - [Marion] Jack! Jack, Jack! Jack! - Now if this gets out. - What gets out, General? He's changed back. Who's to say any of us saw what we saw. - An autopsy, we'll have an autopsy. No, no, no, my mind, it's playing tricks on me. Listen, we'll give him a hero's burial. He became... He came between a sniper's bullet and the President's daughter. - Yeah. - You trace this gun, find out who the owner is. No, no bury it, bury it, bury it with last year's nerve gas. - The President's going to be all right. He just has a little bite on the neck. - Thank God. Al? Tell Marion her father is gonna be... Oh, nevermind. Well, you guys won't have Jack Whittier to kick around anymore. (werewolves howling) (anxious music) - [President] My fellow Americans. This is your President speaking to you from the White House. First, I want to thank you for your letters and telegrams offering me your best wishes during my recent illness. Secondly, I know I can count on your support as I lash out against the enemies of America, both in the press, as well as the Senate, Republicans as well as Democrats, white as well as black, who have circulated the vicious rumors holding members of my administration responsible for the recent and tragic deaths of just a few of my political opponents. At night, I roam the silent empty corridors of this great house, wrestling with my conscience. And I've come to this conclusion. If I'm to prevent our enemies from destroying not me but the very office of the presidency, I must have your support. And so... And so... And so... (werewolf growling) And so... (werewolf growling) (werewolf howling)
