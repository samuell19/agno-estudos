On the first centenary of the unification of Italy, Cineriz, Tempo Film and Galatea dedicate this film by Roberto Rossellini to the living memory of Giuseppe Garibaldi and his legendary Thousand. Come on, come on, young troops! Come all, our banners in the wind Come all with iron, come all with fire Come all with Italia's name in your heart Begone from Italy! Begone, O foreigner! Tombs open, the dead rise up Our martyrs all arise! The sword in their fist, laurels in their hair The flame and name of Italia in their heart: Come on, come on, young troops! Come all, our banners in the wind Come all with iron, come all with fire Come all with the name of Italia in your heart Begone from Italy! Begone, O foreigner! In 1860, Italy was divided into eight states. The Kingdom of Sardinia comprised Sardinia, Piemonte and Liguria, and had its capital in Turin. The previous year, under the treaty of Villafranca, it had annexed Lombardy, stretching as far as Peschiera and Mincio. The Kingdom of Sardinia, with the constitutional king Vittorio Emanuele ll and the prime minister Count Camillo Benso di Cavour, was joined by Emilia-Romagna after the insurrection of 1859. Austria still dominated the Veneto. The republic of San Marino was independent. The grand duchies of Parma, Lucca and Tuscany had voted in March in favor of annexation to the Kingdom of Sardinia. The Papal State included Lazio, Umbria and Marche, its capital was Rome, and the reigning Pope was Pius IX. The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies included Campania, Abruzzo Molise, Apulia, Calabria and Sicily. Its king was the Bourbon, Francesco II, and its capital was Naples. A cry against the absurd frontiers which divided our land and made the children of the same language strangers to each other after 60 years of heroic struggles, became a single voice in this glorious year. All Sicily was filled with the thrill Of liberty. By the early hours of 4 April, 1860, a group of conspirators had gathered in Palermo at the convent of La Gancia, waiting till sun up and the signal to begin the revolution. - What time is it? - You've got a watch. - 5:08am. - What time is dawn? The deacon will give the go-ahead at sunlight. I know! Listen. He's coming. - The convent is surrounded! - How? - Yes, surrounded! - But by whom? - Police, soldiers! - Let's stay here, it's safe. What about those in Ballard and Sant'Anna who are waiting for the signal to revolt? - What shall we do? - Let's get out of here. You go ring the bell, we'll try to get out! The piazza is small. If we surprise the soldiers, we'll reach the streets, and start the revolt. - Let's go! - Let's go! Close the trap door. The flag. Hurry. - Go with him to the bell tower. Hurry. - This way. Come, quick. The bells! The flag! Make ready! - They're here! - Fire at will! Fire! Attention! About turn! First squad, make ready! Take aim! Fire! I'm not dead, I have a right to grace. - I'm not dead, I have a right to grace! - Here's your grace! A few days later in Genoa, April 15, 1860, Giuseppe Garibaldi knocked on the door of Carlo Augusto Vecchi, at the Villa Spinola in Quarto, with the following words: "I come to you, just as Christ sought refuge, because I have nowhere to lay my head." Here we are, Villa Spinola. - How much? - One carlino. - Here. - Thanks. - Here. - Let's go. Open up! Halt. Who were the people who brought you? I don't know. - Where did you find them? - At the station. One was an officer. OK, go ahead. - Here we are, I've brought him to you. - Oh, my dear Bandi! - Welcome. - Happy to see you, General. - Hello, Nino. - Hello. Gusmaroli will have told you why I had you come. - No. - Take a seat. I was in a café in Alessandria when he came over and said, "The General wants you right now." Before I could get my things, he dragged me to the station, put me on the first train, and here I am. - May I? - Please do. You're still in contact with your friends in Siena? Yes, sure. You need to go back there and get a group together. Follow the Chiana valley to the border, taking the town of Pieve along the way. Then approach Perugia and see if they can raise support from the surrounding area. Yes. It's a big task, and I can't spare you any supplies or money to do it. But General, doing this without arms or money is... Are the people committed to the cause or not? If they're really committed, sticks alone will be enough. Sure, if you were fronting the orchestra. - You don't want to go. - You go! I don't want people saying that I failed Garibaldi out of sheer vainglory. Goddamned Tuscans! Slack-ass cowards! Don't get upset, it's only Bixio. He loses his temper easily. Besides, for the time being, we should confine our attention to the matter in hand. - We'll talk about it tomorrow. - Yes General, but... And you can give me the addresses you have then. Tonight, you'll be OK sleeping on the sofa. I should go back to Alessandria, really. If I'm not at the barracks tomorrow, they'll put me under arrest. Don't worry. You're coming with me. - Know where we're going? - No, General. We're going to Sicily. Sicily? Palermo is uprising. The whole island will join the revolution. The Bourbon kingdom is falling apart. Besides, all roads lead to Rome, don't they? But the one going through Sicily isn't the shortest. And it's not even the easiest one. Good night. Sorry I can't offer you anything better. Good night, General. - Can I turn out the light? - Go ahead, General. - Yes, General? - It's late. Be so kind as to make some coffee. Everything you need is there. - Did you sleep well, General? - Yes, thank you. - You must have been uncomfortable. - No, I wasn't in fact. I need to call Fruscianti. We'll go for a walk in the hills. My doctor recommended steam baths for me. And we'll also have to ask Fruscianti to go through my son's clothes for something that fits you. You'd better take off that uniform, if you don't want to attract attention. Yes, General. As you command, General. - General! - What is it, Bixio? La Farina's arrived from Turin. General! General! General, Crispi's back from Milan as well. - Rifles? - Nothing. Nothing. The governor of Milan - what's his name - Massimo d'Azeglio has requisitioned all the weapons from the Rifle Foundation. Crispi, didn't the Minister of the Interior intervene and stop it happening? Yes, but without Cavour's approval behind it, there was no intervention. And Cavour isn't in Turin. It smells fishy to me. - La Farina's waiting. - A good man! - When did he arrive? - Half hour ago. He'll throw a spanner in the works. We'll go, with or without rifles. - We'll speak with a strong voice. - Rifles or not, we go just the same! - Sure, we go just the same! - I read Rosolino Pilo's letters! Whether it's true, what Crispi and La Masa said, whether the revolution in Sicily has been crushed or not, we go just the same! Yes, right. You may leave now. Send in La Farina to me. - Good morning, signor La Farina. - Good morning, signor Garibaldi. - I was sent here... - You'll recall... If you don't, may I remind you that on April 8 I was granted an audience with the King and asked for the Bergamo brigade to respond to our Sicilian brothers' cry for help. And remember, the King was in favor of the expedition and my request. But two days later, he changed his mind. I know who made him change, and so do you. - I'm here to resolve the situation. - I don't doubt it'll be resolved! But I'd like it to be resolved clearly and not ambiguously. - I'm sorry, would you like some? - No, thank you. I've never deluded myself that suddenly, by virtue of the Holy Spirit, Cavour, Mazzini, Garibaldi Vittorio Emanuele and Pius IX would become closely allied to make Italy one. But I'm firmly convinced that, as things stand, we either assist the operation in Sicily without obstruction from the Piedmontese government, or we do it against its will! - Do you mean to threaten civil war? - The situation itself is threatening! Then I'm here to tell you that if it's really impossible to revoke the requisition of the weapons from the Rifle Foundation, you can rely on our help! But this help, for obvious reasons, can't be government help. The guns of the National Target Association, where I am the secretary... Tell me frankly, can they be called rifles or just bayonet handles? Come in. A coded telegram, from Malta. - You've decoded it? - Yes. Read it out. "Total failure in the province and city of Palermo. "Many refugees, picked up by English ships, are now in Malta. "Take no action." The Target Shooting Association rifles are at your disposal. It's not possible! To hell with it! To hell! Goodbye, signor Garibaldi. Come in. Who is it? Look... Look at this telegram. Sorry, if I'm so... "insurrection defeated in Palermo. Continues in the province. Fabrizi." Crispi, what did you wire to Fabrizi? And when? I sent this on the 29th, "Clarify your last message. "Your receipt of batch 171 that's the supplies for Sicily, "seems to be in doubt, from what you say in letter 56." 56 indicates Messina. "Lacking allocation, 136," 136 means 'send', "sacks, grain and, if you agree, 113," which means money "for 19 next." 19 is Rosolino Pilo. So let's leave. Let's leave right away! You, Nino, should run and contact Rubattino Ships' agent to get the steamboats. Assemble the men. Fate is on our side, we'll embark tomorrow. - At Quarto? - At Quarto. Go, Nino! Fellow Italians. The Sicilians are fighting the enemies of Italy for Italy! Fellow Italians, it's every citizen's duty to help them with your words, with your gold, your weapons, and above all, with your actions! A host of valiant men, who have fought alongside me for our country, are now marching to the rescue. Italy knows these men, they're the ones who show up when the hour of danger sounds. Good and generous companions, who have sworn their lives to their fatherland, defending it with their last drop of blood, hoping for no other reward than a pure conscience! "Italy and Vittorio Emanuele," they cried, crossing the Ticino. "Italy and Vittorio Emanuele" shall echo in the fiery caves of the Mongibello! At this fateful war cry thundering from the Gran Sasso to the Tarpeo, the worm-eaten throne of tyranny will collapse, and will rise up as a single man the courageous descendants of the Sicilian Vespers! So to arms! Let us end, once and for all, the miseries of so many centuries! We'll show the world it wasn't a lie that generations of Romans lived on this land! Viva Garibaldi! Excuse me, I have an urgent press report. - I was first, signora. - Go ahead. A moment, please. Listen to this telegram, "Times, London: "Garibaldi embarked tonight from Quarto with a thousand volunteers "on two steamships seized by Bixio from Rubattino STOP "It appears the General wants to sail to Sicily STOP "Enormous emotions in political and consular circles STOP "Details follow." Go get the other dispatches. GARIBALDI EMBARKS FROM QUARTO WITH 1000 VOLUNTEERS GARIBALDI LANDS AT MARSALA GENERAL LANDI, COMMANDER OF ROYAL TROOPS, HEADS TO CALATAFIMI TO CRUSH THE GUERRILLAS LANDED IN SICILY Have the superintendent come in. The superintendent apologizes, but the doctor has forbidden him to go out. Come in. Put the luggage in the General's room. - Have the officials come in. - Yes, sir. So, dear mayor, what's being said about these conspirators? Who knows where these outlaws are! In Marsala, maybe? Major Sforza, 10th regiment. I come this morning from Trapani. In Palermo I received the order to join Your Excellency to march forward against the guerrillas disembarked in Marsala. 'Forward', but where, major? Do you have any precise news where they are? According to my information they're moving inland through Santa Ninfa and Corleone. My sources say that they've regrouped at Cascina Fardella. Impossible, colonel, I passed through there yesterday. I assure you, there was no sign of Garibaldi. According to some rumors, he might be in Marsala. Let's just say we have conflicting news reports. - May we have the Captain of Arms come in? - Yes, willingly. One can't make the decision to march forward without reliable information about the enemy and his strength. I'm sure you too have news of the conspirators. Yes, sir. Captain of Arms Natale Scimeni from Calatafimi. At your command. I come to share my intelligence with Your Excellency. The guerillas disembarked in Marsala at about midday on May 11. This we know! It's a band of a thousand men, for the most part civilians. There are some with strange uniforms, but they're civilians. Well, they're under the command of a certain Gallubardo or Garubardo - one doesn't know exactly. Oh, one knows, one knows. Garibaldi! Your Excellency knows about him, then. Don't bother about what I know, tell me what you know. They're badly armed, that much is certain. They've got two medium-sized cannons and a large one that's even older. They've put them on carts they stole in Marsala and they're struggling to drag them along. Yes, sir. Last night they slept in Rampingallo, on Baron Mistretta's estate. His nephew is called Antonino Forte, Your Excellency... and don't worry, I'll find him when the time's right, that traitor! The nephew's supplied them with rations that they carry with them. - Where are they now? - On the road to Salemi. - And how do you know? - Your Excellency does me wrong! See, Excellency? This is the place. Adamo! Adamo! Garibaldi's in Salemi! Call everyone, go to the mill and make the flour disappear. Quick! Tuflddu! Tuflddu! - Here I am, what is it? - To the mill, quick! I'm joining Garibaldi in Salemi. Peppuzzo! - To the mill! - Be quick! The farmers have united in armed bands. They've put themselves under the command of that lot of traitors. I mean, Sant'Anna, Coppola, Moncada, Curatolo... They've all signed up, Your Excellency. All of them. But I'll take care of them! True, the Baron La Masa may be prowling around Santa Ninfa, but I, your very humble servant, have contacts I can trust everywhere. I understand. Country mafia. No sir! The mafia's in league with the liberals, with the treacherous barons, and with the brigands! That's why my business is suffering. Thank you for the information. Keep your eyes and ears open. - You can go. - Yes, Your Excellency! If Garibaldi wants to march on Palermo, he only has one road, the one which passes through Calatafimi. We'll be there in Calatafimi. - It's an optimal defensive position. - Defensive? Yes, that's what I said: defensive! We hold the road that the enemy has to take. If Garibaldi wants to pass there, it's he who has to attack, with all the risks involved. Permit me, General, why must we put ourselves on defense against a gang of peasants? You know what the public spirit is? Especially the workers. I'm told they're excessively enthusiastic. We have to confirm tomorrow that Garibaldi is in Salemi, and find out in advance when he starts moving. You can go, too. Later we'll decide what to do. - Come on! - Quick! Don't waste time! Come on! - Walk! - Go on! The police! Don't tell me you knew nothing about the farmers' plan to sack the mill! I'm a soldier, not a policeman, but I should have you shot! And you too, Father! You too! We have enough priests and friars inciting rebellion against His Majesty! A fine religion you teach the people! We don't have to answer to you, signor General, for our teachings. In this field of business, I only accept observations, from my bishop. I understand. Soon you'll be quoting me St. Thomas on the legitimacy of assassinating tyrants. - Right? - No need to quote it, since you know it. From today, you'll have to answer if the troops lack flour! You can go. - Have the Captain of Arms enter. - Yes, sir. Your Excellency, the guerrillas have left Salemi and are approaching Vita. - You're sure? - In the early hours of the morning, my men saw the movement of arms between Salemi and Vita. There, General, that's the road to Palermo. Two kilometers ahead is the turn-off for Trapani, then the road goes on to Alcamo, Partinico, Monreale and Palermo. Where we are is called Terralunga. See, up there beyond the hill. Yes, yes! Up there, where your men are. There in the distance, the town that you see is Calatafimi, where General Landi's troops arrived last night. - Are there many of them? - Oh, yes. A lot. Pass me the binoculars. - Who are they? - Civilians and farmers. They sensed the coming battle and fled. Where are those thousand men everyone promised? The people are watching and waiting before taking sides. Patience, you'll see, it'll be fine. For the people to rise up and follow us, we have to show them we can fight. The world befriends the courageous and the lucky. In Genoa, didn't they tell us Pilo and Corrao controlled half the island? So they said. - They've done what they could. - General, look there. The Bourbons are moving out of Calatafimi to meet us. See? They'll take up position on that hill, Pianto Romano, and control the road to Palermo and Trapani. Your choice is to charge up the mountain. Pianto Romano, the hill's name is a good sign - "Roman cry." Where the Romans cried, the tyrants of the world, it's certain we'll laugh, as enemies of the tyrants. Let's go. That sweet image Puts my spirits at ease and suggests A serene and splendid vision Of what the future holds for us Take a step forward, delight of my heart! At 16, I took a husband Take a step forward, delight of my heart! At 17, I broke up Take a step forward, delight of my heart! Look, General, I said the Bourbons would occupy Pianto Romano, didn't I? And there they are. Was I right? Beautiful troops. And how well they maneuver! What time is it? Have our boys eat, while there's time. Menotti, see to it. - Eat. Pass the word! - Eat. Eat, pass the word! Boys, it's time to eat. - Eat! - Give me a piece of bread. What are they doing, eating? Looks like they came for an outing. We'll make them lose their appetite! We'll enlarge their stomach, we'll put a hole in it! - We'll give them a digestive! - Crazy! What people! Adventurers! I've only bread, cheese and olives. Very good, thanks. - Anyone have some salt? - Yes, General. - Here. - Bravo. How good this Sicilian bread is! They sure have good trumpets! - Let's make them hear ours. Where's mine? - Here, General. General, I explored the zone. The hill is unpassable. Those terraces are extremely hard to climb. You really want to fight there? Yes, I do. You don't understand, Bixio. The terrain is hard, which will prevent the enemy from deploying their biggest asset- their artillery. And then, Bixio... Remember that we're here to make Italy or die. Tiroli, come here, make those people hear my alarm clock. Now, my friends, let's thrash these guys. General, should I call back that idiot? Let him do what he has a mind to. It's noon exactly. No one is to fire without my order! Shooting from afar is a sign of fear. - Viva I'ltalia! - Can't you keep still a moment! Long live the King! Look what's coming! Let's go! Giuseppe Garibaldi! Don't be taken in by my cassock, I tell you, truly, it's more solid than your armor. And don't mistake this cross, it'll flare up amid the enemy more terrible than your scimitar. Bless you. Attack! With bayonets! My carriage! Did you communicate to Major Sforza my order to scour the countryside, - but not to make contact with the enemy? - Yes, your Excellence. And so what's he doing? Let's go. Major, they fight like devils! We need reinforcements. Calm down, let them wear themselves out. I'll order the counterattack. Viva Garibaldi! Send a messenger to General Landi asking for reinforcements immediately. What have you done, you're crazy? I said face the enemy calmly! Get back in line! Take a breath, and do exactly what I tell you! General, they've taken our lovely banner from Montevideo. That's nothing. Be calm, boys. Hurry, reinforce that position! Fire! Fire! Shoot accurately! Shoot well, calmly! Don't waste ammunition. Major Sforza sends you this banner, taken from the enemy. He says to inform you that the commander of the Italians was killed. He asks for ammunition and reinforcements. What? He's taken the banner, killed Garibaldi, and needs reinforcements? Trumpeter, sound the attack. One two. One two. One two. Forward, boys! Fire! Ready, Bandi? That group, down there! You from Bergamo, on my right, fire calmly. Aim well! Come on, boys, come on! Help! My Lady of Mount Carmel, help me! Holy virgin, help! Ah, help me. Brother, don't cry so much, it can hurt you. Have patience like me. My God, protect me from this Piedmontese! Don't kill me like a dog! I'm God's creature, too. Give me a priest, I want a priest! Take a breath, relax! One more dash and it's done! General, look! The Sicilians are coming down the mountain to give us a hand! Good. Stay calm. Sorry, I've nothing else to leave you. Go away, stupid! You think I'm your priest or the bishop of Nola? Relax, take this lemon. It'll relieve your thirst. Brothers of Italy Italy has awoken! Brothers of Italy Italy has awoken! With the helmet of Scipio She's bound her head! Boys, Garibaldi told Bixio that here we make Italy or we die! Viva I 'Italia! Viva I'Italia! Viva I'Italia! Viva Garibaldi! Have you seen, Giuseppe Garibaldi, what we could do? Well done! - They're going away. - Defeated. - Excuse me, is Garibaldi among you? - Here he is. The church is full of wounded from the Bourbon army. They're gravely wounded, show them your pity. What pity are you talking about? These are men, like us? They are Italians, our brothers! Thanks. Come. - Viva Garibaldi! - Viva I'Italia! Thanks. Bravo, boys, you fought well. My knee! Mama! Help... Please take good care of these wounded and tell them they'll be free to go home or to fight with us. And they're free even to rejoin their regiments and fight against us again. No! What are you doing? What has tyranny reduced you to? I'm just a man who eats and drinks like you. Let's kiss like this, on the cheek. We're brothers, we're equal. If I remember right, the temple of Segesta is near here. You remember your classical studies, huh? - Segesta's not far, is it? - It's near. - If you want, we'll take you. - Mount, let's go. - Here we are! - Good thing, I was getting saddle sore. Come on! Let's go. Look what they built here! Stop, old man! Belandi! Let me drink, too. Come drink! It's wine from Etna! Wine that breaks your legs! How is it possible that people capable of such greatness were reduced to such misery? Garibaldo, help us! The partisans attacked Landi's column retreating from Calatafimi. And look what the Bourbons did - looting and slaughtering! - Take care of this woman. - Help, Garibaldi! General Mechel is advancing from Monreale. Rosolino Pilo was killed at the Renna pass. The Bourbons have 20,000 men in Palermo! 40,000! 40,000! When Mechel left Monreale he had 8,000 soldiers! Bavarians! Swiss! So, what shall we do? Let's go inland to the mountains and start a revolt. No, we have to get to Palermo. - The road's blocked. - I know, but we have to get to Palermo. - La Masa's waiting for us in Gibilrossa. - True. Orsini, take the main Corleone road with the artillery, supplies and wounded. - And us? - If Mechel is hoodwinked by this, we'll go on from Gibilrossa to Palermo. The General! Viva Garibaldi! - Dear General! - La Masa, how's it going? The trick worked well! Look what the Palermo papers published this morning. "The troops of General Mechel "have put Garibaldi's guerrillas to flight on the Corleone road. "The adventurers are dispersing in the mountains. "The criminals who, when Garibaldi's bandits arrived, "united with them and created anarchy and thuggery, "will be punished as an example. "The government of His Majesty the King guarantees the restoration of order "as the population wishes." Now, General, I'm sure we'll see the end of the tyranny and hypocrisy that calls oppression, "liberty"; and bullying, "justice"; contempt, "love"; conscience, "defeatism". Let's hope, dear La Masa. And now, Bixio, to Palermo! To Palermo or to hell, General. The garibaldeschi! The garibaldeschi! Arm yourselves! Arm yourselves! The garibaldeschi! The garibaldeschi! Throw stuff down for the barricades! - Hurry up! - Throw down more! Everyone help! - Mattresses! - Come on! - Everything! Right now! - To the barricades! I'm a French journalist. Can you tell me where Captain Cairoli was wounded? I don't know, I think at the Alberghesca. I know Missori and Captain Dazza exploded a bomb in the middle of a barricade. Right over there, at the Alberghesca. The Neapolitans, then, had to cease fire. - At your command, General. - Carry on. - Want to drink, Garubaldo? - No, thanks, dear. Have you deployed men to control the entrance to the castle? - Yes, General. - O, my friend! What a beautiful surprise to find you here! You know my friend, Alexandre Dumas? The author of "The Three Musketeers". - Have you got a safe-conduct pass? - Here, signed by the major. Gusmaroli, make a new pass for this illustrious poet. Date it and write, "Let the holder pass freely throughout Sicily "as an illustrious man and my intimate friend, Alexandre Dumas." Add, "I'll be grateful to anyone who shows him kindness." - Keep going! Move! - Scoundrels! Halt! Who are you? I'm a French journalist and he's English. Here are our passes. Is it true that at the Alberghesca there are some 800 deaths among the inhabitants? Ah, I don't know. Can I help with anything, signorina? We learned that, the morning of the 27th, some Neapolitan soldiers found a family composed of a mother, a father and a girl. They killed the mother and father, and a corporal grabbed the daughter, called Giovannina Splendore, - and carried her away as booty. - I don't know about these things, but I do know many others which no one knows, because they're very secret. Want to come to my house, tonight? Come to me. See the street? Not the first or second or third, but the fourth on the right. I think it's number 11. - I'm quartered there. - OK. A stretcher, hurry! Viva I 'Italia! We need to put them up against the wall. They entered a hospice, raped all the women, shut the doors and burned it down! Stop, I'm in command! Stop, or you'll deal with me! - What are you doing? - Your Excellency, we're convicts, we suffered in the Bourbon jails. Arrest them, then we'll see what they did. - And you? - Colonel Bixio, I know your fame. I know your reputation, you're a hero. Thank you. Signor General, the Bourbon negotiators are arriving. To avenge our fatherland That's what we want! General, the Bourbon negotiators are here. Have them come in. In God's hands, signori. - Please, be comfortable. - Thanks. Sit down. - After you. - Please. Gusmaroli... Go. So, to what do I owe the honor of your visit? Signor Garibaldi, we want to put an honorable end to so much suffering. That's just what we propose. Sorry, but I can only offer my cigars. Bad cigars from Nice. But such is war. - Thanks, I don't smoke. - Thanks, neither do I. So... General, don't you think it's time this ended? I can't deny, signor Garibaldi, that these things, fights, barricades, blood, don't suit anybody. - We crave for it to cease. - Well, it's up to you. I have full powers to negotiate a truce. If we conclude one, I'll depart for Naples and lay out the conditions to His Majesty the King. I'll ask him for his exact orders. General, if we might, so to speak, arrange conditions that are honorable and discreet, I'm sure, indeed, we could come to some agreement. I'm persuaded that with God's help and with calm and soothed spirits... Very good. For my part, we could draw up a truce right now. - Propose your conditions. - They're already written. Read, Colonel. That drinking water be restored immediately to the castle. - This is what we ask. - OK, granted. That doctors be sent to the castle for the sick and wounded. With all my heart! - Prisoners be exchanged immediately. - Certainly. Please. Thanks. - Thanks. - Yes. And you must release the hostages taken by General Laura in Palermo, who are held in the castle. For the hostages, I don't have power to negotiate, but I assure you on my honor, General, that they're very well treated. I'm certain His Majesty will set them free as soon as I see him in Naples. Moreover, you must vacate the city immediately! - But... - Listen! These are my conditions. Vacate the city, withdraw the troops from the castle, and I consent to your forming a camp on Mount Pellegrino. Agreed? Agreed. The war of liberation continued. From Palermo, Garibaldi pushed toward Milazzo and the strait of Messina. Viva I 'Italia! The coasts of Calabria appeared at last before the eyes of the Italian liberation fighters in all their blazing beauty. Would Garibaldi be able to cross that piece of sea? Would he find the military force and political initiative to launch his men against all the difficulties, despite the plots concocted to cause his effort to fail? Just a short stretch of sea, the strait of Messina, separated the advanced point of the revolution from the Bourbon fortifications of the castello of Scilla. The flame of liberty on the road to Naples. - Look, the General! - Yes, it's Garibaldi! We completed the voyage from Palermo to Messina in 32 hours. At Milazzo, the weather was filthy. I sent a longboat for news and learned that Garibaldi, and you too, had left two days before for Messina. The victory of Milazzo still seems a miracle to me. Bosco had 5,000 men and I don't know how much artillery. Two field batteries and about 30 guns in the walls. Marvelous. Logically, the Messina garrison also surrendered without a fight. In Milazzo the Bourbons had armed men, all to their advantage. Now they say we attacked them with 10,000 men, powerfully armed. - With those two big cannon of ours! - How great, the General! But not an equally great politician. What I fear is that, when there's truce, politics will peep out also among us. - Some want to kill the campaign. - They plot to keep us here. And some Sicilians want immediate union with Piedmont. - The General's gloomy and pensive. - As well he might be! But I'm sure he won't listen to his overly prudent advisers. Sure. He won't want to break off halfway through achieving the goal of his life! But who's that? Indeed, who's that? Here we are. Come in, please. Who's he? He behaves like an officer in civilian clothes. Please. I've the honor to consign to you these letters from His Majesty. Shh! Quiet. Give me something to drink, my throat's dry. Who is he? - Vittorio Emanuele's aid. - Ah! - Do you know what His Majesty asks me? - He asks you not to cross the strait. You know he wasn't able to approve your expedition. He wants to distance himself from it. - He's a good man, Vittorio Emanuele. - You've gone from victory to victory. It's known what grave dangers you've run. His Majesty, in Turin, told me his concern for the difficulties of landing on the Calabrian coast. Francesco ll still has a powerful army and the Neapolitan fleet is intact. I don't hide the difficulties from myself, but when a people want liberty, no amount of soldiers are enough! His Majesty has written to you as king, but I believe I can tell you that if you disobey him because duties to Italy force you to... I've always said Vittorio Emanuele is a very good man. Too bad he's so badly surrounded. Thanks. Tell him... I'll give you my reply to His Majesty. Gusmaroli! Gusmaroli! ' See you! " Go! - What happened? - We'd like to know. Menotti, go to your father. Try to find out, so we can understand. Explain our feelings to him. - Yes, go. - Yes, I'm going. Come in. - What is it, Menotti? - Nothing. Nothing, Father. When are we going to Calabria? - When? - Yes, when? Father, this is what our men are asking, they're languishing. - A few bits of sea, and Italy! - I know! But they're well fortified. The artillery's ready, 20,000 men are waiting for us! Yes, we know. And crossing the strait means carrying the flame of revolution into continental Europe. Did you know that Napoleon Ill has asked the English navy to help them block us in Sicily? So we have to act quick, before... I know, I know. But I don't think England will go along with this request. It's true waiting's full of perils, but I have other worries. I cannot lead my men and all of you to a massacre! Father, we're ready to risk everything! The Sicilians want immediate union with Piedmont to secure the liberty that's been captured. Yes, I know. If annexation is proclaimed, Cavour will immediately send the Piedmontese army to Palermo. And then what would become of Italy? - If you don't dare to do it, who will? - Yes, I know we have to try! How heavy it is, my son, to carry all these responsibilities. So? So... this is the answer that I've prepared for Vittorio Emanuele. "Sire, Your Majesty knows "with how much affection and reverence I am filled for your person "and how much I long to obey you. "Yet you must understand in what embarrassment it would place me today "to have a passive attitude in face of the people of the Neapolitan continent "whom I've been obliged to hold back for some time "and whom I promised immediate support. "Italy would call me to account for my passivity "and would claim immense damages. "On termination of my mission, I shall depose at the feet of Your Majesty "the authority which circumstances have conferred on me "and I shall be very fortunate to obey for the rest of my life." Have this letter delivered to Litta Modignani in Messina. Father... My young friend, is Musolino certain the conspirators will let us in - at the gates of the Scilla fortress? - Yes. - And if the thing doesn't succeed? - We'd at least have gotten the Bourbon forces to flow toward Soilla or up the Aspromonte, where we could withdraw, while you, farther south... - And you're ready to try? - Yes, General. I can cross the strait tonight. During the night, a storm caught the young Calabrese. Anxiously, he struggled against the fury of the elements. Dawn surprised him still far from the coasts of Calabria, which he reached by swimming, so as not to be spotted by the Bourbon lookouts. He knew the conspirators in Calabria were waiting for him anxious to move into action. The revolt was spreading even into Bourbon ranks. Rosa! - Rosa, you know who I am. - No, I don't know. - You mean to say you've never seen me? - No, never. - I'm the son of Baron Plutino. - I don't want to know. Rosa! I have to contact someone in town. At least your father. - So someone will know I'm here. - He will know. - You should tell him... - I know what to tell him. Rosa... - Cover yourself! - Ah, yes. I've done it. Covered myself. Hide here. Scilla's full of soldiers and police. Everyone in town knows you were with Gallubardo. - So you do know who I am? - No. I've never seen you. I'll go see my father and you wait here. I've never seen you. And I know what I'm saying. Baron Plutino's son is on the beach at Fiumare Alta. - I saw him and said I'd tell you. - Ah. And so? Get my hooded cloak, the fraternity one, and take it to him. At five o'clock, it's the San Rocco procession. - Understand? - Yes. Don't let the habit be seen. I won't let it be seen. - San Rocco, make your miracle happen! - Make a miracle happen. Shh! Come in. Last one close the door. Come inside. Come on. Master of Ceremonies... - ls everyone ready? - Everyone. - Are we happy to convene the meeting? - Very happy. Brothers and companions, I humbly declare this session open. Grace and favor. - As you were. - Grace and favor. Master of Ceremonies, with words of humility, your brother and companion asks you to form a circle. Right away. Sit down. The Society of the brothers of Montalbano is at your disposal, Bellintrino. - I thank you and all the society. - Grace and favor. Brothers, 250 men sent by Garibaldi will cross the strait to seize the fort. Garibaldi is counting on us. Brothers, we must help him. And we shall help him! - Who will come with me to the mountain? - Him. We'll make a big fire up there. It's the signal for those on the other side to depart. - When they land... - One moment. Beach, town, coast are guarded. They're on their guard. There are soldiers and police everywhere. Yes, we know. As soon as the Garibaldini land and engage in combat, our men in the fort will have to open the way for them. The Calabrese conspirators will take the fort. With its artillery, we'll protect the landing of the majority of Garibaldi's forces. Let's go. One moment. Go through the garden, over the wall. He'll show you the safest way. Come on. Let's go. Take care, eh? Go on. Good night. Let's go. A girl on duty mustn't have ears! We're ready, the men are blocking the streets. So? - Can we begin, Commander? - Let's begin! Open up in the name of the law! Open! - What do you want? - Shut up you! - What have you done to my father? - Silence! - Luigi Spezzano, come with us! - Why, what have I done? Who wears the beard, sooner or later ends up in jail. Quick, get my shawl. Go on, take him away! - Don't leave the baby alone. - Where are you going? "A girl on duty mustn't have ears," and don't I know it! But if she didn't, there'd be trouble. Rosa! Shush, don't cry! Who goes there? - Take arms! - Who goes there? Viva I 'Italia! Forward! Farther south, Garibaldi, aboard two steamboats, passed into Calabria with the majority of his forces and carried out a surprise attack on the Bourbons. Forward, march! I see horses advancing! They're red shirts. - Ready? - Attention. - Attention, boys! - Ready? Yes, yes! They've been practicing "The Garubaldo Hymn." Greetings, hero. The city awaits you in celebration. You come to liberate us from the Bourbon tyranny and we cry with faith, ”Viva I'Italia! Viva Garubaldo!” The beautiful sight of these exceptional men, fills my heart with songs that I want to sing - lots of songs. They're simple and true, taken from here and there, written without any pretense, yet they speak from the heart. The city is in celebration! It awaits you, General Garubaldo! Thanks, thanks. Viva I 'Italia! Run, Garibaldi's coming! Garibaldi's arrived! - Space! Space! - Back! - Garibaldi, we want justice! - Make way! Silence! - Back! Enough! - Look what the Bourbon soldiers have done! - They've robbed all our things! - They've stolen our cows! Enough! Keep silent! You unworthy sons of Italy, give back what you stole! We don't want to consider you defeated enemies, we want to have you in our ranks, to call you brothers, to have you as companions in great and glorious battles! We want to go home! We don't want to fight more! Me too! I want to go home! - I have three children! - Enough! Shame on you, men without faith! I'd rather you were enemies than to see you as cowards! We'd treat you like brothers and you oblige us to treat you as defeated! Bandi, Sirtori, Gusmaroli, Menotti, take charge of these men. Confiscate their arms, ammunition, horses, mules! Return the stolen goods to their owners. Those who want to fight for a united Italy united and for liberty are welcome to join our ranks as brothers! The others, whom we could keep prisoners, let them go home instead! Go! We're not afraid of cowards. Let them go home to tell of the generosity of the strong! Meanwhile in Naples, King Francesco II prepared to abandon the palace and withdraw to Gaeta. - Your Majesty. - Thank you. You see, I'm leaving to keep the promise to save Naples from the horrors of the war. Our Don Peppino is at the door. I shall never forget your fidelity to me. And wanting you to cherish that memory, I've named you knights of San Gennaro. Don Libb, watch your neck! Sire, I'll do everything possible not to lose my head. Don Miché, I congratulate you. You've served your country very well. I'm conscious of having served Your Majesty as well. Had you done me the honor of listening to my counsels, you would not find yourself in this position. You dream of Italy and Vittorio Emanuele, but alas, you'll be unhappy. Our vision is short-sighted. The future is known only to God. May Your Majesty leave in peace and be sure that your fellow citizens shall not forget that Your Majesty, by his withdrawal, spared the city the horrors of civil war. - Let's hope so. - Her Majesty the Queen! Gentlemen, we'll meet again formally on the Volturno. We'll be back soon, it's not goodbye. - How sad to be leaving. - Let's put on a brave face. I thank you in the name of Italians and all humanity for the sublime act which today you perform. For good reason you're right to rejoice on this day, when the tyranny that weighed on us now ends and a new era of liberty begins. I thank you for this reception, not for me, but in the name of the unified Italy which you are building through your cooperation. It's not just Italy that thanks you, but the whole of Europe! O bravo, Bandi! Finally you're in Naples, too! Yes sir, General! See what I'm reduced to? I'm suffocating in paper. In war all goes well, at least as long as you're winning. Here everything goes badly, even if you try to do well. You've no idea what I brought upon myself by naming that poor Dumas superintendent of museums. One has to have patience! Let's forget about it. But go change, I see you need to. I need a thousand years to change skin. I feel ashamed to be dressed like this in such a beautiful city. - It's a capital, decorum is called for. - I'll do my best. They tell me everywhere in Naples people are selling Garibaldi uniforms. True? Yes, so I've been told. I need one too. - So go and come back quick, I need you. - As you command. - Do you have red shirts? - No. Who told you to make them like that? Who knew how you Garibaldini dressed? We had to invent. Shirts like this. We don't have any. Look farther on, maybe you'll find them. - Let's go, Menotti. - Good day. - Did you hear? - What? The Piedmontese troops under Generals Fanti and Cialdini have crossed the borders of the Papal States. We were just talking about it. It's clear they're heading for the Neapolitan states. - Certainly. - What does that mean? Cavour wants to come straighten us out? This could prevent us marching on Rome and Venice. What will happen? Will we be forced into civil war? Cavour hates us, he's in sight of his goal and will knock down any obstacle in his way. He doesn't want to be second to anyone. I'm sure our leader, who'd give anything to avoid civil war, will take Cavour into account. And pressure is building on the Volturna, with Francesco H's army. You'll see it increase now. The Bourbon line is solid from Caiazzo to Castel Volturno, their advance posts are three miles from Caserta, the cavalry patrols much closer. They'll try an offensive to take back Naples, and won't hang around for Vittorio Emanuele. That's why those faithful to Cavour, like Agostino Depretis, who's been imposed as deputy dictator of Sicily, demand the annexation of the island to Vittorio Emanuele, without waiting for Garibaldi to complete his project. We expect the worst. I'm telling you, I fear for Garibaldi's life. Anything's possible. Getting rid of him suits the Bourbons, Cavour, Austria, Napoleon. Everyone! We must keep our eyes open. Who's there? Someone's asking for you. Bring him in. - Major Bandi? - I am. - Take this letter which is for you. - Thank you. See him out. What is it? A letter from Mazzini addressed to me. He's come to Naples. When did he arrive? Yesterday or today. He just got here. This is not entirely good. Imagine how dangerous it'll look to anyone wanting annexation to Piedmont! Or to those who shout up and down at any mention of annexation. Should I wake the general? He's hardly slept two hours, let him rest. I don't think he'll thank you when you announce this 'good' news. Band“. Band“.! Come in. Sorry, did I ask you to wake me at 3:00? - Yes, General. - Fine. Good night. - General... - What? Would you like to know who's arrived in Naples? Mazzini! Right. He's just sent me this letter. I will go at dawn to the Caserta front. I'm sure the Bourbons are preparing to attack us. If it turns out to be nothing serious, I'll come back to Naples early afternoon. Tell Mazzini... Tell him I'll greet him as a brother ought to greet a brother. As you command, signor General! It's been 10 years! I really didn't believe anyone could raise Sicily with just a thousand men. You've demonstrated the contrary. I was wrong and am happy I can tell you so, with all humility. But I'm certain I'm not wrong today, in reminding you that without Rome there can't be unity. Because Rome is the only, the true capital of Italy. - Now Rome matters. - Yes, Rome. The most moving, most precious, most stimulating dream of my life, and it always has been. But Cavour... Do you wish to forget that with 1000 men you conquered a kingdom? And that you really have it in your hands to offer it to Vittorio Emanuele? Do you realize what you represent for Italians? Today you are omnipotent. Ask the King firmly for the removal of Cavour. I already have. Just two weeks ago I wrote to the King, and related for the first time the outrageous deeds perpetrated by Cavour, Farini, and their friends. And I added, "Today as we approach the expansion of the great Italian drama, "I must implore Your Majesty, "for the sake of the holy cause of the unity of Italy, "to remove these individuals." Good. And then? In response, the Piedmontese troops were ordered to cross the Marche to bring us under their control. Did you ever think you'd see the King's army invade the Papal States, fight the papists at Castelfidardo, or bombard Ancona from land and sea? I didn't, that's for sure. When I heard, I was as happy as I always am when someone does something against the enemies of Italy. But let's not hide the fact that the Piedmontese are coming south with the intention of blocking the road to Rome. It's the price Cavour pays Napoleon Ill. But we can't abandon Rome and Venice to the Pope and the Austrians at a time when all the liberal minds of Europe await Italy's contribution. I know, I know. Cavour is basing his plans on the consolidation of the monarchy, not on the expansion of democracy. He wants to put the banner of Italian unity back into Piedmonte's hands. He wants to wipe out the myth of Garibaldi, the people's hero, which casts a shadow on the figure of the King. Of his King. A few nights ago, I heard someone scream, "Viva Italy unity, death to Mazzini!" As if I were the enemy of Italian unity. Indeed. I don't know what the immediate future holds for us, but one thing must be clear from now on: even if circumstances force us to put off the liberation of Rome and Venice, no one can call it a renunciation, but only a conscious, though bitter, sacrifice for the unity and peace of Italians! - Certainly. Civil war, never! - Don't forget, dear Mazzini, that Piedmont is the sole Italian state with an organized military force, and that I liberated the south with the cry, "ltaly and Vittorio Emanuele!" But Rome matters! Rome matters! We'll need a miracle at Volturno. Dear Garibaldi, you've delivered a mortal blow to the Bourbon army from Marsala to Naples. You can't doubt now that there will be a decisive victory. The soldiers rallied round Francesco ll, beyond the Volturno, are the best part of the Bourbon army. They're more than 50,000. They're the most faithful, the most expert. Fanaticized by their officers and chaplains. The King has issued a proclamation promising the troops freedom to pillage if Naples is liberated on his birthday, the day after tomorrow. The situation is critical. I can't and mustn't hide it from you. I only have 20,000 badly armed men. Half of them will be facing enemy fire for the first time. Until yesterday I could count on surprise, today that's no longer the case. Our first pitched battle awaits us. If they manage to break through, Naples is lost. See there, General, a mass of troops are forming in Capua. - We should bombard the city. - Bombard it with a civilian population? Better to lose a battle! Don't fire back! Watch out down there! Hooray for Italian unity! Lieutenant! Lieutenant! Attack! Push back those bastards! Bixio, where's Bixio? Down there, General. You all right? It's nothing, General. The horse is dead, that's all. Get back up, Bixio, I need you! My horse! My horse! Fire! Fire! My friend and brother in arms, Vecchi, has sent me a letter for Garibaldi in Turin. "Friends and admirers congratulate you on the great victory at Volturno "and exhort you to write yourselves to Vittorio Emanuele to come to Naples. "Don't wait until the King arrives. "Take the initiative and send an open telegram to the King in Ancona. "Then make official contact with him in person. "That way, you'll triumph over your enemies, and no one will be in any doubt "that the King's sudden presence was desired." This letter's clearly dictated by Cavour! But here in Naples discord and agitation reign. And who's the cause of it? The same ones who don't want us to march on Rome and Venice! Who didn't want to have us go to Sicily, or cross the strait and chase away Francesco ll! They want to march on Naples to take control of Garibaldi. They consider us a nest of red republicans and socialist demagogues! And they want to throw us into the sea. I've said it before, the truth is that Cavour, doesn't want to be second to anyone. Cavour has always been urging Vittorio Emanuele to cut ties with Garibaldi. He wants him to occupy Naples. They want to take over the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies that we, thanks to the genius of our leader, have conquered. - We'll march on Rome! Viva Garibaldi! - Viva Garibaldi! Signori! Signori! Menotti! Hate, envy, jealousy don't matter. Our sight must always be directed to the unity of Italy. The battle of the Volturno was a defensive battle, not offensive. It saved Naples from the return of the Bourbons, but didn't destroy the Neapolitan army, which is still 40,000 strong between Capua and Gaeta. Also Mazzini urges me, pushes me, to make a run to Rome my very first goal upon entering Naples. But how can I abandon the Neapolitan army? Gentlemen, we shall go to Rome, but take our time doing it. It's impossible right now. For the greater good of Italy. I've signed the following decree. "Italy and Vittorio Emanuele. "To fill a vow dear to the entire nation, "I, the dictator, decree: "The Two Sicilies, which to Italian blood owe their ransom, "are part of Italy one and indivisible, "with its constitutional King Vittorio Emanuele and his descendants. "I shall depose into the King's hand, on his arrival, "the dictatorship conferred on me by the nation. "The deputy dictators are charged with execution of the present decree. "Giuseppe Garibaldi." Let's see what time it is. You who are young, go up the road to see what's happening. I'm quite anxious to meet Vittorio Emanuele. Who knows, surely by now he can't be far away. Coming from Venafro, he'd certainly have spent the night in Presenzano. Isn't it humid this morning? With my rheumatism. See? See how humid it is? - General. - What is it? Listen. General, he's coming back. Don't you hear the trumpet sounding far away? General, the King's coming. I saw the Piedmontese on horses. I heard trumpets. Quick, mount up! I salute the first King of Italy! Thank you. How are you, dear Garibaldi? Fine, Your Majesty. And you? Very good. Sire, when I landed on Sicilian soil and assumed the dictatorship, I did so in your name. I fulfill, today, my heart's vow. I hand over to you power over millions of Italians, tormented till a few months ago by a savage despotism. Thank you. Viva the King of Italy! Here's Vittorio Emanuele, our King! King of Italy! Viva Garibaldi, Viva Garibaldi! Francesco ll, with the soldiers that remain to him, is preparing for battle, once again, at Garigliano. I ask Your Majesty, for the honor of the first clash, for my men and for me! You've been fighting a long time, it's my turn now. Your troops are tired, mine are fresh. Place yourselves with the reserves. Viva Garibaldi! Viva Garibaldi! Viva! We salute you, General! Might I have some cold water? Certainly, General Garibaldi. It's an honor for us! If you'll permit me, I'd like to offer you something. Here, eat this, it's fresh. For you too. Put it here, Don Peppi! They told me that now we have to place ourselves with the reserves. After consigning to Vittorio Emanuele ll the kingdom he had liberated from the Bourbons, Garibaldi went back to his island, Caprera. Viva the General! Viva Italy united! Viva I'Italia! Viva Garibaldi! We'll meet again... in Rome! Brothers of Italy Italy has awoken With the helmet of Scipio She's bound her head Where is Victory? Let her bow down For God created her slave of Rome Brothers of Italy Italy has awoken With the helmet of Scipio she's bound her head Where is Victory? Let her bow down For God created her slave of Rome Let's band together We're ready to die, we're ready to die Italy has called Let's band together We're ready to die, we're ready to die Italy has called! Yes! Brothers of Italy Italy has awoken With the helmet of Scipio She's bound her head Where is Victory? Let her bow down For God created her slave of Rome
