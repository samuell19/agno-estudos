Rafe. Rafe. You'll do it, rafe? You gave me your word. I'll do it. I ain't afraid of dyin'. What's that you told me? "'Tis a poor thing to fear the inevitable." Right. Who said it? Someone who wasn't dyin'. That's good advice, but hard to follow. 'Scuse me. The hell you doing, covington? You don't open the captain's door without permission. You sure as hell don't cross that threshold. I'm gonna beat you within an inch of your life for what you did to charles rodney. Charles rodney got what he deserved. Rafe, come on. We gotta get goin'. There's cape mendocino coming up. We've got to cast off. That'll do it, huh? Mutiny. Mutiny. What's the tariff on that? Hangin'. I reckon we better not get caught. You're turned out like a rooster for the harvest fair. One lousy shirt. He runs off and leaves a chest full of gold. - The rest wasn't back wages. - So what? * No maid i've seen * * like the fair colleen * * that i met in the country down * get a little target practice here. You shoot 'em with that, you're just gonna make 'em angry. One's all we need. They're just buffalo. Well, they'll be gone soon enough. Gone? They're thick as flies on a bull's ass. Ten years from now, they'll be nothin' but a memory. A frenchman, a german and an irishman went to a saloon and order whiskeys. The drinks arrive, and there's a fly in each one. Frenchman says, "mon dieu! I can't drink this." And the german flicks the fly out of the whiskey and drinks it down. The irishman grabs the fly, he turns it upside down and he says, "spit it out!" "Spit it out!" How long you figurin' on stayin'? Long as it takes. You, j.t.? Long as it takes. I owe it to charlie. How about you, leprechaun? Thanks to our honest friend here, i'm still a little short on funds. Those gold mines in montana are still callin' my name. 'Tis kindly i'm thankin' you. Well, i hope you find your pot of gold, rock. May the apple of your eye see only good, and may god make smooth the path before you. See you in wyoming for christmas goose. Is this the rodney spread? Forty thousand acres charlie purchased from the sioux chief red cloud. Well, it ain't heaven, but it's near enough. Sighs] close as we're likely to get. Boy, that mrs. Rodney, she sure ain't much of a housekeeper, is she? You get started here, j.t. i'll be back. What can i get for you, friend? I'd like to order some supplies. Ten pounds each of bacon, beans, flour and coffee. A pound each of sugar, salt, jerky. And some rollin' tobacco. A long ride or a long stay? That the new centennial model? Yes, sir. Winchester's first big-bore lever gun. That carbine's 45-60, got a case-colored receiver and factory engraved. - Special order? - Uh-huh. But the, uh, customer died before it came in. Thirty-two dollars. Fella must've come into some money. "Moonlight sonata." You don't look like a man who knows beethoven. I don't. My mother used to play that. Really? Don't i look like a man who had a mother? I guess i was condescending. You were. I read somewhere beethoven used to wear his clothes... till they came apart and fell off his body. You can read. Another surprise. Even write a word or two-- short ones. A wit. It's rare in these parts. Rare as sassy women, i expect. And i suppose you prefer your women ignorant and docile. Yes, ma'am. Well, you're amusing enough, mr.-- rafe covington, ma'am. Ann rodney. Mr. Covington? Mrs. Rodney, your husband sent me here. My husband has been dead for more than a year. You must be mistaken. I must be. Where can i get a drink? Bruce barkow's saloon, the national. I'll, uh, pick up those supplies in a day or two, thank you. Ma'am. Sir. Well, he sure is an interesting fellow. He could use a bath. What'll it be? What are my options? I got whiskey, whiskey and-- whiskey. Catch on fast. To charles rodney. May he rest in peace. Amen. Yes, sir. Good man. Sheriff moncrieff. Also justice of the peace. Both of which are in short supply in these parts. Rafe covington. Obliged. I haven't heard rodney's name... spoken around here for some time. Sad end. Well, those sioux raidin' parties... frequent that wind river trail. Did you catch 'em? No, sir. Never even found poor charlie's body. Bastards carried him off like a bunch of crows. I seen it all. I'm sorry to hear that. Why? Must've been upsettin' for you. Giddap! Go now! You want the postman, the barber or the undertaker? Barber. Should've figured. A new face in town... ain't likely to have mail just yet. Well, the barber... is in. Shave and a bath. Uh, shave first. No sense gettin' blood all over a clean body. It ain't polite to follow people around. Joe. Wylie. I'm joe gill. Suit yourself, young fella. I used to work for charles rodney, he was a hell of a good man. Yes, he was. I kinda wish i'd been with him on that trip. Thing just might've turned out different. Where was he goin'? Wasn't goin' anywhere. He was comin' back from san francisco. Business. 'Scuse me. That awful day on the wind river trail, how big was that sioux raidin' party? I don't recall. Five. Six maybe. What was rodney wearin'? What was he wearin'? You heard me. What damn difference does that make? That was a year ago. No difference, you bein' a liar and all. Say that again. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. No need for hostilities here. We're all friends. Come on, snake. Snake! Go on, get outta here. Sorry about that, mr. Covington. Why are you apologizin'? Didn't wanna give you the idea this was an unfriendly town, i guess. I'm, uh, bruce barkow. Well, i love a friendly town. Believe i'm stayin'. Good. That's good. This ain't over, boy. No, it's not. Can i ride along with ya? Do i have a choice? Seem to be lookin' for a lot of trouble, mr. Covington. Not particularly. Oh, yeah? Well, that fella you braced back there in town, snake corville. And? And i ain't never seen nobody brace him and walk away from him. Charles rodney wasn't killed by a sioux raidin' party. Well, if the indians didn't kill him, mr. Covington, how'd he die? Oh, that's how. Whoa, son. You speak sioux? How'd you know? It's a gift. Say somethin' friendly. Easy, easy, easy. It's gonna be all right. It's all right. Great heavens. - We'd better get outta here. - We'll set her leg. It's broke. That ain't no run-of-the-mill indian girl. You see that mark on her? She's the chief's daughter, and we better go. Cut some splints, joe. They catch us here with her, they'll skin us and make jerky out of us... and hang us on the nearest sycamore. Easy. Shh, shh, shh. Well, thank you kindly. You rounded up our missin' stray. Rope her, brother luke. 'Scuse me. Get your own damn squaw. We cut that one out for ourselves. You wanna take her, you're welcome to try. But your brother's gonna have a tough time... pullin' on that hog leg while it's still lashed down. Luke, is my colt lashed down? Yep. Well, you still can't take down the three of us. Maybe not. Maybe so. Enjoy my squaw, mister. We'll meet again. Well, you might turn out to be useful. Are you this way always? 'Cause if you are, i'm gonna end this association. And why's that? Hell, look at ya. First day in the valley, you rile every hard case in wyoming. To say nothin' about that war party over there. Well, it's a gift. It's a wonder to me you lived much past ten years old. Squaw-nappin'. Now... that's about as bad a thing as you can do. That old man in the lead, that's red cloud. And looks to me... like he's got a pretty good grouch on. What the hell's the right word for "leg"? Tell him we're friends of charles rodney. Rodney's dead. I promised him i'd keep his property safe. He says since you helped his daughter... and you're charles rodney's friend, you may go. Much obliged. Let's just ease on outta here. That's true what you said about lookin' after charlie's ranch? It is. Well, hell. That's the best news i've heard in a year. Hyah! Easy. How'd you know he was just gonna do that? It's a gift. It's a gift. Guess today wasn't my day to die. Well, hell. Day ain't over yet. For you, ann. Bruce, you know i can't accept it. Oh, of course you can. Nothing's too good for my fiancee. I wish you wouldn't use that word. I would love to replace it with "wife." Bruce-- i'm a patient man, but my heart's in a hurry. Charlie's gone, ann. He was a good man and he loved you, but that's the past. And you're my future? If it pleases you. Excuse me, mr. Barkow, uh-- i told you not to disturb me. They had a run-in with that covington fella too. He took me and luke's property too. I don't want to hear it. I don't want to know about it! Just take care of it. Sorry, ann. Bruce, i can't pay the mortgage again this month. There just aren't enough schoolchildren. Ann, there will be. Someday... this little town is gonna be a magnificent city. I'm gonna run it. I want you there by my side. I always thought charlie had valuable property in san francisco. So did i. I loaned him that money in good faith. Foreclosure wouldn't be right. Maybe i should just let the ranch go. Do you know a man named rafe covington? Yes. Yes. I met him today. He said charlie sent him. A hell of a mess around here, but it used to be neat and tidy. Lookie here. This kid's killed this critter twice. If you want it rare, there's a bunch of 'em runnin' around outside. Why don't you go take a bite of one? Mind your elders, boy. You know, i've been around this place a long time. I was here till barkow moved mrs. Rodney to town, and then he run me off. - Why'd she listen to him? - She's alone, she's scared. He's got manners and smells nice. Besides that, he wants this ranch. - He wants it somethin' fierce. - Why's he want this place? - I don't know. - Maybe he wants mrs. Rodney fierce. - Maybe. - Maybe both. Is it christmas yet? You don't look rich. Maybe rich stopped mattering. Maybe charlie mattered more. Maybe this gourmet cookin' appealed to me. Brendan mullaney. "Rock" to me mates. Joe gill. Pleased to meet you, joe. Welcome here to crazy woman ranch. - Come on, my boys. - Heya! Come on, boys. Hyah! Hyah! Whoa! Hey! Hyah! Yah! Hyah! Hyah! Herd 'em, joe! Oh, boy. - Better slow down, young fella. - What difference does it make? Well, see, if you take your time, you get a more harmonious outcome. Here, let me show you, son. See, really all you need to do-- and you don't need to kill yourself doin' it-- is take a couple of licks this way, a couple that way, cross the heel, you pretty much got it. I'm gonna pick up those supplies. I should do that, rafe. Nope. I'll go. He'll go. You're full of surprises, mr. Covington. Mrs. Rodney. No. I'll get it. Spend a lot of time in church? Well, it's a good place to think. Care to tell me what you're thinking about? Ma'am? 'Scuse me. Your husband wasn't killed a year ago. No? No, ma'am. He died in my arms six weeks ago. Morning, mr. Covington. Mr. Barkow. Ann? Ready for our ride? - Have i interrupted something? - No, bruce. Mr. Covington was just leaving. Yes, ma'am. I'll be at the ranch. What ranch would that be? Rodney place. You're letting him stay at your ranch? Certainly not. Then he's trespassing. We'll get sheriff moncrieff. Bruce, he said that charlie died in his arms six weeks ago. Why would he say that? Ann, he wants something from you. For a ranch like yours, most men would shake hands with the devil. Come on! Come on, girls! Go on! Hup! That won't wash off in the rain. Let him up, boys. Ain't it a beautiful part of the world, mr. Covington? I'm glad you're here. And for me, hell, it's good to be home. You bet. Old hennessey's dyin' of the tuberculosis, so the missus sends for the priest to give him the last rites. So the priest arrives at the deathbed and says, "hennessey, do you renounce satan?" "No," says hennessey, "i do not." "You do not?" Says the priest. "No," says hennessey. "A man in my condition can't afford to make any enemies." Well, we've made a few. It won't be long, they'll be tryin' to run us outta here. If i couldn't hear you breathing, i would have thought that you had expired. This waitin' is affectin' my strategy. Well, i do hope that that strategy don't include plans for that queen, 'cause she's gone. - No more irish jokes. - No. I like 'em. There are two bulls at the top of a hill in county mara. The young bull says to the old bull-- would it help if i give you back your queen? That's a boy. - Mrs. Rodney? - Hello, joe. Seein' you here brings back good memories. For me as well. I thought the place would've been more run-down. It was. Howdy, ma'am. John thomas langston. - Mr. Langston. - Nice to see ya. Rock mullaney. Pleased to meet you, ma'am. Will you excuse us, please, gentlemen? Go on, pup. Cut a trail. Go on. Mr. Covington, when my husband died, i turned my back on this ranch, and i haven't set foot on it since. It wasn't easy for me to come out here today. I appreciate that. But what you said disturbed me. Who are you? And why are you doing this? Mrs. Rodney, your late husband was my friend. - I'm keepin' half my promise to him. - What do you mean by half? I gave charlie my word... i'd look after this place. And you. My husband asked you to look after me? Yes, ma'am. My husband never mentioned you to me, mr. Covington. I don't believe you. I can't. Oh, well. I met charlie in san francisco. My father was stationed there in the navy. Charlie was a businessman. Real estate and shipping. But this was his dream. I came along because i loved him. It was gonna be such an adventure. Then our daughter died at four months. Cholera. And then charlie. Tamed me right down. I shouldn't have come out here. I don't belong here. Don't you? No. Charlie loved this ranch. He talked about it all the time. But i believe what he loved most... was you. Enjoy your stay here, mr. Covington. It'll be short. Afternoon, gentlemen. Pee wee. What'll it be? Whiskey with a whiskey chaser. Yours is on the house, mr. Covington. - Two bits apiece for the rest of you. - Why's his on the house? I always stand a man his last round. Ah, we just got here, lad. Mike taggart says he'll kill him next time he sees him. Figured that. Taggart comes in, you might wanna buy him a drink. Another wee dram. You got a problem where i hang my hat, don't send a woman to deliver the message. I won't. Any message you get from me will be crystal clear. Stay away from ann rodney. Whoa. Slow down there. Take your time. Get a more harmonious outcome. God invented the whiskey to keep the irish from ruling the world. You're very persistent, aren't you? Mrs. Rodney, hear me out. If you want me to, i'll go. I met your husband on a freighter out of san francisco. I was workin' my way down the coast. He was shanghaied. And he told me he sold off his holdings in san francisco... to pay off the mortgage on your ranch, so he celebrated. He got drunk, got robbed and ended up aboard our ship, and when the-- when he tried to escape, the captain beat him to death. That was six weeks ago. Do you have any proof of this? Just my word. Pardon the intrusion, ma'am. Mr. Covington? Just let me think. Thank you, ma'am. Mike taggart's callin' you out. Covington! I want you. And my gun ain't lashed down now. Mr. Thompson, did charles rodney order that '76? Yes, sir, he did. How's my credit? Covington! Come here. Where you goin', covington? I'm gonna blow you outta them fancy boots. Now you calm down, taggart, and you'll get a more harmonious outcome. Besides, you really oughta thank me. Thank you? For what? For the fact that you're wearin' your hair. That was red cloud's daughter you poached. I don't know what you're talkin' about. Then we got no quarrel, have we? Aah! Bastard killed my brother. He'll do the same to you. Go to kansas. Find bo dorn. Bring him back here. Bo dorn don't like bein' brought. Likes bein' paid. Whoo! That was some shootin'! Wasn't shootin'. That was killin'. Thank you, li. It's overcooked, stupid. I'm sorry, mr. Barkow. Cook it again. Cook it again, now! Well, why did taggart confront mr. Covington, bruce? It's not delicate. Neither am i. Shortly after he arrived, rafe covington attempted to rape a squaw. Mike taggart caught him and freed the squaw, but covington got away. And naturally, being a man of impeccable character, taggart felt it necessary to avenge the squaw's honor. Yeah. Something like that. Thank you, pee wee. It looks marvelous. Special for you, miss ann. Bruce, he said charlie died aboard a ship. He sold his san francisco holdings to pay off the mortgage on the ranch. But he was robbed and shanghaied. Well, perhaps he wants to acquire a lovely ranch... and the lovely lady that goes with it. Isn't that what you want? Ann. I love you. There were no holdings. No one was shanghaied. Charlie died on the trail home. The prime requisite of charlatans is their ability to fake sincerity. One, two, three! Up! Go on up there! You have got to be-- maybe the dumb bastard thought it was water and wanted to have hisself a bath. This isn't the only fine creature here that should be wanting a bath. You can say that again. Dumb right bastard. Let it go, joe. Let it go. There you go. There you go. Go on. Up. - What is that stuff? - The boys here are covered in petroleum. What's "tapolian"? It's an oil. They make kerosene out of it. And asphalt for pavin' the streets. - Is it worth anything? - It's worth more than enough to pay off the mortgage. - Howdy, gents. - Hello, walter. Sheriff, you're sittin' in my rocking chair. - That's what it is for. - It's for people i invite to sit in it. Walter, you ain't invited. - I wanna know your version of them shootings. - Self-defense. That's it? Yes, sir. Well, there's some folks around here who says different. - Well, they're not bein' truthful. - You son of a bitch. Mr. Taggart, i'm sorry about your brother, but i gave him every chance to walk away. Are you gonna arrest him or not? Not today, luke. What else you come for, walter? You are trespassing illegally on this property. You can leave freely... or in irons. It's your choice. Ann rodney owns this spread. I'll get off it when she says. Well, i'm the mortgage holder. And i am telling you you have three days to clear out. It appears you already got that mortgage money, barkow. Prove it. I believe i will. Sheriff moncrieff? Well, there is a rather large outstanding balance on this, mr. Covington. Three days, mr. Covington. You had no right to do that. Did you put flowers on taralee's grave? - No. - He did. Have i not devoted myself to protecting you and your interests? Yes. Been at your beck and call? Yes. Come over in the middle of the night... to chase away nightmares and spiders? It was a very big spider. Could have put a saddle on it. In three days, if rafe covington has not vacated crazy woman, i will kick him off... by whatever means necessary. One question, bruce. Is the ranch still mine? Of course. Then i'll decide who's welcome to stay on it. - Why you shoot that old evans, joe? - Well, it's got 28 bullets. And i ain't a very good shot. I'm goin' to town. Syl. Apparently, right and wrong don't mean a thing to you. Mr. Gill, once covington leaves the ranch, you're welcome to stay on. No, sir. Your talk's just as cheap as your liquor. What'll it be? I got whiskey, whiskey and-- that'll be one dollar. Sir? One time he killed three fellas, cut their heads off, hung 'em above the pawn shop... right by the sign that said, "money to loan." Then he's havin' supper with a guy one time. Chased him down the end of main street, killed him, skinned him, nailed his hide to the barn door. He's tougher than the back wall of a shootin' gallery. And that, boys, is bo dorn. Sounds like one scary fella. He does, doesn't he? Well, maybe he's just passin' through. Nope. See, he don't leave kansas unless he's on his way to kill somebody. - I'm bettin' that somebody is you, boss. - No bet. So you're gonna go to town and face this bo dorn fella... just to keep a promise to charlie. Ah, come on now, joe. There's more to this than real estate. What are you laughin' at? Oh, i'm just reading the signs, rafe. And the tracks is fresh. 'Bout 115 pounds, answers to the name of ann. She plays nice piano. "Above them all the archangel: "but his face deep scars of thunder had entrenched, "and care sat on his faded cheeks, "but under brows of dauntless courage... "and considerate pride waiting revenge: "cruel his eye, but cast signs of remorse and passion to behold--" "i feel the link of nature draw me; "flesh of flesh, bone of my bone thou art... and from thy state of mine shall never be parted bliss or woe." I always liked poetry. Never could understand it. Really? I was hopin' you could help. Well, seeing as though it's such a beautiful day, why don't we all go play outside? The last time i saw you, you were busy killing men. And all to honor your word to my dead husband. You were part of the promise. Yes, i was. Rafe. What sort of a name is that? Short for raphael. The archangel, sent by providence to guide and to guard, to heal and to save. That raphael? My mother was a god-fearin' woman. And she taught you beethoven and milton. After a fashion. She sent me to the jesuits. To be a priest. Yes, ma'am. The lord works in mysterious ways. Tell me, how does a man go from the jesuits to-- couldn't get the knack of turnin' the other cheek. Every time you finish talking, you get on your horse and ride away. Why is that? Well, that's an interesting question, considerin' you've been tryin' to get rid of me ever since i hit town. Well, maybe i've changed my mind. - Well, that'd be nice. - I don't wanna lose my ranch. You won't. I appreciate your respect for my husband's memory, mr. Covington. - And your promise to him. - It's a promise i'm plannin' to keep. Afternoon, mr. Dorn. You mind steppin' outside to smoke that? Can't abide the devil weed. I'll be, uh, out here. Let's get down to business, barkow. That, uh-- that 500 i already sent you? That's just a down payment. There'll be 500 more once covington's gone. Well, for that amount of money, i wouldn't waste time nor lead. - So how much do you want? - I've been lookin' to relocate. Kansas is a tad too civilized to suit me. Now, the rodney spread, well, might suit me just right. I've been workin' on that over a year. What, schemin' and trippin' over your spurs? You should have let me just shoot ol' charlie and be done with it. But that was too easy. "Let the sea take him." That suited your fine hand a bit better. It was a good plan. I just didn't figure on covington. What kind of dinosaur upends his whole life to keep a promise to a dead man? Well, it don't matter. You want me to make that dinosaur extinct, we're equal partners. Take it or leave it. It ain't all that bad. I could just kill you and keep the bitch and her patch of dirt all to myself. Good evening, ann. It's a little late for a visit, bruce. Just in time, actually. The white satin dress, i think. - The one i bought you? - What about it? I'd like you to wear it, tomorrow. To our wedding. Did i miss something? Or did another ann rodney agree to marry you? Do you want me on bended knee, ann? Okay, here i am. Marry me, ann. Bruce, please get up. - What's come over you? - Love. Love. And love demands an answer. I'm-- i'm not ready. You better damn well... get ready. Or what? Or-- just do as i say. I was run off this place once. No more. - I'm stayin'. - Well, i'm with you, rafe. If it wasn't for charlie on that boat, i'd have thrown myself overboard. He kept fightin', no matter what. He never gave up. Neither will i. My whole life i never had roots deeper than topsoil. I believe i'm stayin'. What are you gonna do? Take him down, flush him out. Either way, your problem's solved. Breakfast, ann? Oh, that'd be lovely, gene. Push the rest of the strays into the west canyon. No later than noon. You won't like it there. Whoo-hoo! Andale! Them boys won't make much fun of these when i serve 'em up. Go on. Find your mama. Don't look like much. But it's damn near priceless. That's oil, ma'am. Is this what bruce is after? One of the things. And what are you after? One of the things. Are you after the oil? No, ma'am. Get her home, boys. That's a boys. Whoo-whoo! Bruce has hired a killer. A man named bo dorn. Well, he had to hire somebody. Do you know dorn? - Know of. - Can he-- kill me? Yes. Do you care? You know i do. Well, maybe you should say it. Well, maybe i should show it. Can he? Nobody ever has. Go. Please. Aw, kid. No! It's starting. What's starting, ann? Trouble. You're wrong, darling. Trouble isn't starting. It's ending. I thought i told you to put on that satin dress. I know the truth, and i believe rafe. Well, i'm not exactly dressed to the nines myself. Guess it'll be come-as-you-are. Shall we? Shall we what? Walk arm in arm down the aisle. You've lost your mind. There's no way-- bruce, please. Did you say something? Gene! Let me go! Oh! Somebody help me! What in the world-- gather the dearly beloved together, your honor. We're getting married. I'll never marry you! Oh, my! - Sheriff. - You gents remove your hats. If anybody here objects to this union, let him speak now or forever hold his peace. I object. Barkow. You're the big man in this town, but this ain't right. Let her go. Yes. Let her go. Now, bruce, don't you think-- pee wee, get back behind the bar where you belong. I said let her go. My, oh, my, oh, my, you're so brave today, but it's so... badly misguided. Proceed, your honor. Do you, bruce barkow, take ann rodney to be your lawful wedded wife? I do. Do you, ann rodney, take bruce barkow to be your lawful wedded husband? I do not-- yes. She does. By the power vested in me... by the territorial authority of wyoming, i now pronounce you man and wife. - You may kiss the bride. - No! Not my finest hour. Aah! Let me go! We can't let this continue. Well, there's not a whole lot we can do. Oh, yes, there is. We can stop being afraid. They'll kill us, melissa. We'll continue this later... when you've calmed down a touch. May the road rise to meet you. May the wind be always at your back. May the warm sun shine on your face... and the soft rain fall on your feet. And until we meet again, may god hold you in the palm of his hands. And may you be three days in heaven before the devil knows you're dead. Amen. How many, you figure? Only three. Where are you going? Just be ready. How do you know he's gonna be there? That's where i'd be. I'm not a very good rifle shot. Aw, hell. The undertaker is in. Hyah! - Hoo-aww! - Yah! Come on! Come on! Hold on, joe! - It's a first for me, joe. - What's that? I've never had to fight my way into a saloon before. How many? Five. Rafe, there's something i need to tell you. Miss rodney might be in there. Barkow, he sort of forced her to marry him yesterday. What? They got married. I heard you. Barkow! You still hiding behind that woman? That's my wife you're talking about! - Send her out! - You come and get her! Hello, walter. Aw, what the hell. We're low on cartridges. Melissa, thank god. Come on, dear. We have to be very careful. Joe! You shot me. Just when things were going so well for you. And... may the best man win. No, no, no! The other arm! My hat. My hat. I did something, melissa. Yes, gene, you did.
