You can have this house. I'll go and live somewhere else. You can come back here to live. You're being pushy, as usual. Don't expect me to thank you. I know you're afraid of this house. Murderer. Ken Ogata Saki Takaoka Shota Matsuda Hana Sugiura Eiji Okuda Screenplay by Sakura Momoyama Yukiko Yamamuro Cinematography by Hirokazu Ishii Music by Hibiki Inamoto Hello. My name is Yasuda. Is the caretaker around? I've been waiting for you. I'm in charge of the apartments. Come inside. You've come a long way. Nagoya maybe a bit warmer than it is here. Five boxes arrived containing your things. I put them in your room. Mrs. Yokoyama, this is your new neighbor, Mr. Yasuda. How do you do? Come in. Step inside. Coming. "She is no longer the young woman she once was." "She is quite lost, anxious and lonely..." "Hey, you! Hey, Angel! Hey, blue sky! Matsutaro." Koji, take my shoes off! Can't you do it yourself? The bar's closed already. This isn't the bar. It's your home. Koji. Get the hell out of here! Koji, what are you waiting for? "Yasuda" Hello. Hi, there. What are you looking at? He ain't her husband. It's her jobless boyfriend. He's just one of the men she's had. She's supposed to work at a bar, but who knows... When she moved in, she was still with her husband. Things began to fall apart when they had the kid. Mr. Yokoyama seemed to love the kid though, but he walked out on her a couple of years ago. Would you mind handing me those? See the seedlings? There. Thanks. The kid doesn't even go to kindergarten. I don't understand parents nowadays. Stupid. Die. What do you want? Uh, hello. I told you not to suck your thumb! "Family Crisis, over 32,000 child abuse consultations" Akiko! Don't! The daughter of a school principal does not shoplift! Aren't you capable of raising her? What kind of mother are you? Don't! Don't hurt her, please! Harvesting the vegetables already? What! Isn't it obvious? That brat from upstairs pulled them out. Mrs. Yokoyama? Mrs. Yokoyama? I told you already. Don't touch my money! But honey... I really need some money. Get your hands off that! Give it back to me! This is the last time. Give it back! Give it back to me now! Let go of it! I'll pay you back. Pay me back now then! Stop whining! Shut up! Ouch... Give it back to me. Let go of me. I'm sorry. Forgive me. I'm so sorry, forgive me. I don't know what to do anymore. You have to forgive me please. Mom. Stop it, Mom! Mother! Don't apologize to this man. You were watching me, weren't you? He took everything away from me. I can't go to work with my face like this. Could you lend me some money? Call the police. I'll testify that he is violent and dangerous. It's a criminal offense and you're a victim. What are you saying? If you want something in exchange for money, I'll make you an offer. Please stop. Stop it. Can't even get it up. Old man! It's not what you think! It's not what it seemed. It's not... What's this? How about we draw some cute animals? See? Isn't it nice that I'm drawing with you? Nobody ever took care of me like this. In ten years, you'll be a good-looking woman. Don't get turned on by a kid! You're not innocent either! Stop that! Stop it! You're killing her! Stop... Stop it! She'll die! Let go of her! Just for a little bit. Don't sleep there. It's not good for you. You'll catch a cold. I guess your Mom isn't coming home tonight. She's not coming home. Oh, well, I'll tuck you in. Did she hurt you again? Poor thing. You poor, poor thing. Come back, brat! Come out. You can't hide. What are you? Wait! Where the hell are you, brat? Poor little one... We have to make a grave. Put it in. This one has passed away. Let's pray for it so it goes to heaven. Wait right here. I'll be right back. Wait for me. Do you want to go back home? Or do you want to come with me? Where the sky is blue... Where cotton candy clouds float... and a white bird soars in the sky. What shall we have? Macaroni? Hamburg steak? They have a kids menu too. I want a melon cake. A melon cake. They don't have it. How about a Hamburg steak? Melon cake! Are you ready to order? Two Hamburg steaks. Two Hamburg steaks. Do you want a set? Yes, please. Do you want rice or bread? Rice, please. Two sets with rice. Let me take your menus away. I haven't even asked your name. My name is Matsutaro Yasuda. What's yours? Brat. No, your name... Brat! Here are your Hamburg steak sets. What's wrong? Pain. What? Pain! Does your stomach hurt? What the... Why don't you take a bath? Brat, to the bath. Your feet are dirty and you smell. Not until you take a bath. Behave or I'll leave you behind. Don't touch me! You shit! Don't touch me! What is it? Do you need to go to the toilet? Sachi. Sachi. Oh, so you're Sachi. You're little Sachi. Are you going to leave me? Of course I won't. We made a promise. We're going to find a blue sky, and a white bird. Really? Yes. Are you Koji Mizuguchi? Yes. When did she disappear? He says that it was at midnight. I was at work so I don't know. I was out cold. I'd been drinking so I don't remember... Are you two married? No... What happened to your head? I... I tripped and fell. I was drunk. It's nothing serious. Why did it take you two days to report her missing? This isn't the first time she's run away. We haven't had a ransom call or anything. Is there anyone she would turn to? I don't know. She's too strange to make friends. Where does she usually play? I don't know. Has anything changed lately? What was she wearing then? Don't you know anything about your own child? Don't tell me what I should know about my kid. Mind your own business! You're the police. Go and look for her! Find the kidnapper. Don't waste our tax money! Would you call her a mother? If she doesn't turn up by morning, we'll start looking. Yes, sir. Do you want to try? I'll show you how. Your turn. Aren't you hungry? How much for two? 500 yen each. There you go. Sachi! Sachi. You must be starving. Here you go. You said you wouldn't leave me! Sorry. It's my fault. I'm sorry. The building's too old. Nobody wants to move in. They are thinking of building something else here. Rooms 203 and 204 are unoccupied. Since when? Half a year ago... Maybe a year. You want to look inside? No, we don't need to. Mrs. Yokoyama left a while ago. Come in. He's a decent man. Used to be a school principal in a big city. Abe. Take a look at 203 and 204. Just in case. Alright. Follow me. The man who lived here was divorced. His wife left him. He lived here with his son, but they left half a year ago. "Hey, you! Hey, Angel!" "Hey, blue sky! Matsutaro." I didn't know what to do! That was an illegal entry! Illegal? That old lady wouldn't have any idea about the law. You're missing the point. Abe, do you understand? Detective Iwai. It's got to be the boyfriend. The neighbors heard his drunken raving that night. Sachi, the 5-year-old missing girl. She used to go to daycare. They had a school play. What do you want? Mom. What are you talking about? Give me more! More! I don't know what you're saying! The play was called, "Angel's Pants." She was looking forward to it. Angel's Pants... On a perfect laundry day An angel washed her underpants She finished washing them They were nice and clean So she hung the pants to dry and took a little nap Suddenly a breeze blew across the sky Blowing away the angel's pants Like white petals spiraling down The angel's pants flew out of her life Enough already! When are you going to stop? The play's over already! Are you hungry? I'll be back with some bread. Wait here. Check this out! This is classic. "A Night with an Enchantress and Magic!" They must be joking. "Enchantment guaranteed!" Cool wings. Can you open it? The next train's coming. Aren't you getting on? You weren't sleeping. Why did you lie? I didn't want to be a suspect. I was really concerned about the kid. She disappeared into the night all alone. So you went after her, yelling. Listen, Detective... I'm a victim, too. I'm listening. I was attacked out of blue! I was looking for her and... And there he was... What do you call it? He's disguised as one of those... Like a... A ninja! It was a ninja! That's right. Ninja? Yeah, a ninja clubbed me with a bamboo stick. With a stick this long. I'm serious. Can I take a look there? Look at this. Use these. Thank you. A strange night. A strange old man. A strange girl with wings. What can this be? Is this a horror story? I wonder if it's ready. Thanks. What's wrong? Not hungry? Have a bite. It'll warm you up. Pain. She doesn't like it hot. Right? She isn't your granddaughter. Am I right? Where are you two going? It's none of your business. Can I come with you? I've got nowhere else to go. I have a little money on me. Did you run away? How about telling me your name? You haven't told me your name either. I'm Wataru. Matsutaro Yasuda. Matsutaro, is it? Nice to be acquainted with you, Matsutaro. Do you feel nervous around me? Don't be. I'm totally harmless. I wouldn't hurt anyone. I've never made my parents cry. They must be worried about you now. Are you a school teacher or something? Don't talk like that. Isn't Japan peaceful? Everywhere else, there are wars, poverty and people dying. But here I am, eating potatoes. Something's not quite right. I grew up overseas. I'm Japanese but called a foreigner. I could never really fit in here. I mean, in school or society. My Japanese is weird. And my parents... It sounds cool to be a foreigner but the truth is... Do you know Zambia? Sure. It's in Africa. What you don't know... is that lots of people die everyday in Zambia. Because of poverty, AIDS etc. The average life expectancy is 33. You wake up and see dead bodies in the street. So I withdrew. I wouldn't leave the house. So, my parents bought me a monkey. It was so tiny. It would only eat out of my hand. We slept together. We had baths together. I loved him so much. But I had to leave him behind when we came back to Japan. It was against some treaty. I was totally devastated. I cried my eyes out. I've never cried so much in my whole life. For me? Acorn. Thank you. So where's the younger officer today? He's not here because this isn't police business. I wanted to talk to you in private. What do you want to talk about? About the kid? Don't you think you are a bit too indifferent? You gave birth to her. You have an obligation... to take care of her and to nurture her. Nurture? How? You're the mother. Don't you love her? Love? You must have had it easy, Detective. Here's your order. Only happy people are able to speak like you. My parents gave birth to me, only to neglect me. You don't know how to hold a baby if you've never been held. I'm bringing her up the way that I was brought up. Slow down! Going faster! Oh, no! It's too fast. What about this? It's my lucky charm. I got this in Africa. I need to pee. I'll take her. Where is the toilet? Behind the curtains. Let's go. Funny, isn't it? I have to thank you. You put a smile on Sachi's face. What's that? Why do you have such a thing? I got it in Africa. Diplomatic immunity. They don't check the luggage. I'm lying. You can get one from the Internet these days or from gangs. That's not my question. Why do you have it? No reason. Is it real? I've never used it. Do you want to give it a try? What are you doing? I'll keep this for you. I can't stay with somebody who has a dangerous secret. Give it to me. Don't you have a dangerous secret? Give it to me, or we go our separate ways. You fool! Be quiet. The hotel staff will complain. So you do have a secret. Do you think so? You didn't write your name on it. You're sneaky. You talk like a Superhero but... Wataru. What's wrong? The goldfish. The goldfish? What happened? What is it? It's not well... One of the goldfish is sick. May Buddha help its soul... Is it going to die? Why? Every living thing eventually dies. When we die, we go some place. Everything? Anything alive. Where do we go? When we die, we'll go to some place... where there's nothing. And where there's nobody else. Nobody? Right. Nobody. It's a big empty void and nobody is there. All alone. Wataru. You're scaring her. I'm only joking. Sometimes you're inconsiderate. You have an attitude problem. Shut up, old man! Don't bully him! I'm sorry. Sorry, it's my fault. Wataru, come with me. We'll look for a blue sky together. Where pink cotton candy clouds float... Come with me. Where are you going? Go back to sleep. I'm coming too! Sleep. I'll be right back. What is it? See? I found a bigger acorn than the one I gave Wataru. Wataru. Wataru, look! I found a bigger acorn! Wataru. It hurts! Don't go so fast! Fool! You're an idiot! You had many years of life ahead. So many things you could've done! Then why? Why? How could you kill yourself with a smile on your face? Let's make a grave because Wataru is dead. This is Wataru. Grandpa, let's go. Have a good life. Suicide? We don't know that for sure yet. That's right. The girl and Yasuda were seen here. She's okay. But Yasuda might be connected to another criminal case. Get a warrant for Matsutaro Yasuda. Too bad. You are a month too late for mushrooms. It's really disappointing. She would have enjoyed to see mushrooms. News on the missing 5-year-old in Aichi prefecture. The police have a suspect, a man who lived next door. He disappeared at the same time as the girl indicating his involvement. A nationwide manhunt is underway. Don't touch it. It'll interfere with his driving. Give it to me. I want it back! No. We don't want to bother the driver. It's alright. There should be a cartoon on. It's mine! It's mine! Hello. What can I do for you? And you are? Detective Iwai. And you? I'm Matsutaro Yasuda. It's Yasuda! Mr. Yasuda. You're okay. We've been worried about you. How's the girl? She is fine. Can you put her on the phone? I'm calling to ask a favor. I'm turning myself in. I'll return the child unharmed. So just let me have 3 more days. Or even 2 more days. Mr. Yasuda. The child is fine. I'll return her safely. So please. Let me tell you... I know. What I'm doing is unlawful. Then give it up now. Stop dragging her around on your criminal escapade. She might get psychologically scarred. I contacted your daughter. She didn't tell me anything. Maybe... she doesn't know anything. Maybe she's protecting you. I'm looking for redemption for my past sins. I have to do this. Don't involve others. She lived in hell! Nobody ever treated her nicely. Not even her own mother! She used to hide in the garbage with her ears covered! Was I supposed to leave her there? You're the police, investigate. Who's the real criminal here. Where is he calling from? From a payphone in Miyoshi-cho. We'll block off the town limits and nearby main roads. Let's move. Sachi, let's go. We came here because you wouldn't talk on the phone. On the day your father disappeared he called you here. We have a record of that. We'd appreciate any information that you could give us. I know nothing. A little girl's life is depending on this. I didn't speak with him. He's your father. Am I supposed to believe that? I went through a lot to forget what he did. It took 20 long years. Finally, I got my life back. We have no relationship. Thank you. "Dear Akiko." "I'm writing to you from my sojourn in the mountains." "The first trip I've made in decades." "The autumn leaves are brilliant yellow and red." "I've been made aware of things I've neglected for many years." "I'm afraid I'm a pathetic man." "They say people have several trips that reflect the journey of their lives." "But... this is the first trip of that sort I've ever had." "Right now... when I look back at my life I despise myself, I'm disgusted by my insights." "I'm ashamed of myself for not having talked to you like a good father would have." "I'll continue traveling." "Until I see the blue sky." "I'm with your mother, too." Omega watch, circa 1950s. You've been taking good care of it. I need to see some kind of identification to lend you money. Isn't there anything you can do? I would if I could but rules are rules. Okay, then. I'll keep this and the pen for awhile. I won't officially pawn them. How about 10,000 yen? Thank you so much. You must be cold. Let's get something nice and hot. Sachi? Say, "Ah." Good girl. She has a cold. I usually wouldn't treat a patient without medical insurance but... I'll give her something to reduce her temperature. Keep her warm. Take lots of fluid. We're finished. You're a good girl. You're okay now. Grandpa. Do you love me? I love you, Sachi. Come on. Could you stop the bus? My grandchild has to go to the toilet. It's Yasuda! Sachi, we can do it. Yasuda! Get him! I would say that the mountains... in the background are the Japan Alps. Are you sure? Do you have any other photos? This is all I've got. It's a sure thing. Yasuda and the girl with wings were seen a few hours ago. I'll call for back-up units. Not so fast. If they went up the mountain, they'll have to come down. Let's wait. What is this case we're on? What do you mean by that question? I don't know for sure anymore. Is this really a kidnapping case? Kidnapping is kidnapping. Those wings... The wings on the girl's back. When I saw her running with those wings... I felt like I should just let them go. Everybody's lost. The girl's mother, Mayumi. Her boyfriend, Mizuguchi. They need somebody like Yasuda. Even Yasuda himself. Grandpa... thank you. POLICE HEADQUARTERS Sachi, listen very carefully. I have to... I have to go to... What's wrong, Grandpa? Nothing. Sachi. Let's go. Where are we going, Grandpa? Sorry... Let's go. Where are we going? Don't cry. Stop crying. Don't cry, Grandpa. Don't cry. Grandpa, don't cry. Stop crying. Stop crying. Don't... I'll be with you. So don't cry. Sachi. I'm home.
