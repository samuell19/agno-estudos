Give yourself up, Webb. We have you boxed in. Give yourself up. Thank you, Mrs. Kingsley. My pleasure, Mr. Webb. I know it's critical, sir. We're searching Kingsley's office now, Mr. Waverly. I wanna check through every one of these files later myself. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Do you have any idea what this is? Don't touch it. I know it's critical, sir. I'll keep you informed. Yes, sir. They've just arrived. You're on immediate reassignment. And I can do without being spellbound by your recent adventures. We know you've established that THRUSH used the refugee committee as a front. and you failed to capture Webb. In that case we can dispense with the formality of a written report? Now, look, Kuryakin. Cut out the cracks. Robert Kingsley has disappeared. Kingsley used to be a field operative. 'He used to be in the field like you.' Now, he is number four man here in Hong Kong. Every scrap of information we gather passes through his hands and he has vanished. Any documents go with him? We're checking, Solo. I'd have already told you if I knew. What did you find? Sir...a capsule. It gave off kind of a vapor. What are you talking about? Are you, are you alright? Yes, sir, I am now, but.. ...we just stood there, the secretary and after we took a sniff of that stuff.. ...and it was the strangest.. What's strange? What are you talking about? Mr. Grant, for about a minute.. ...we just stood there.. ...conscious, perfectly alright except it was like.. ...waiting for someone to tell us what we should do. Then it wore off and I came here to report to you. Show me this capsule? I wish I could, sir, but it evaporated. That's right, sir. Did it leave any residue? We'll check that out. That's your assignment. 'Robert Kingsley...find him.' - 'Mrs. Kingsley?' - Yes. We're from UNCLE and we'd like to have a word with you about... What's happened? Is is Robert? - Uh.. - Come in. - Please, come in. - Thank you. Thank you. Well, please, tell me, what is it? Mrs. Kingsley, you're husband has disappeared. It can't be. He's not in that kind of work anymore. It's true, Mrs. Kingsley. I don't believe it. There must be some mistake. I'm afraid not. Now, do you have any idea any information at all where.. But you people know far more about Robert than I do. I only happen to be married to him. UNCLE is his way of life. I understand how you must feel but, uh.. He has a desk job now. How can he disappear? Mrs. Kingsley, can you recall anything that he did, anything at all. Anything that he did, anything that he said that could help us? How? He never discussed his work with me. He wasn't supposed to, you know that. He seemed happy and content. How can I help you? Oh. You always ask the wives. The last people who know anything about the real lives of men like Robert. Did he ever say anything about a capsule that we found in his desk? No. No, nothing. Mrs. Kingsley.. 'Yes?' 'Seven, seven, seven.' Over and over, I.. I don't understand. What does it mean? Solo here. Another disappearance, Mr. Solo. Dr. Kurt Erikson of Berlin. 'Europe's most distinguished chemist.' 'His file was missing from our Hong Kong office.' 'Presumably with Kingsley.' 'Mr. Kingsley?' I'm Dr. Erikson. Dr. Erikson. Doctor, I'm honored by your presence here and your collaboration. Thank you. Sit down, doctor. Mr. Kingsley.. ...this is an historic moment. Ironically so. For history as the world knows it will soon end. You do have it with you, doctor? To look at this.. ...the world's future on a scrap of paper. 'We can change mankind's personality.' Mold it to any shape we want. Steer it in any direction with this. And we will. Oh, excuse me, Dr. Erikson, your daughter. 'You said you wanted to bring your daughter with you.' Have we kept her waiting outside? No. Anna will be coming on a separate plane. That's a wise precaution, doctor. She should be leaving Berlin any moment now. Please, don't make me explain, okay? Where are you going? I'm leaving Berlin. That's all I can tell you. Please. I didn't expect it so soon. Well, I didn't expect it at all. I'm sorry, I have to go. But I'll be back. Believe me, I will be back. 'Look, I came all the way from America to be with you.' Y-you and your father on, on our vacation. Steve, do you think that I want to leave you? Well, then don't. This is ridiculous. I love you. No, the time to take over the Kingsley project is now.. ...at it's inception. Mr. Veeth is absolutely right. We can't delay until the last minute. Take over, supervise, control from the beginning. I'm in command here. Directly responsible to THRUSH Central.. ...only. And I say no. Mr. Webb, you don't seem to realize that once Kingsley presses that button, THRUSH and everything else on Earth is in his pocket. We must take over now. Suppose we do.. ...and Kingsley's team of geniuses simply refuses to work for us. We'll have control, alright. I have one hundred million dollars worth of equipment which we have paid for.. ...but cannot operate without them. Force them. No, I will not take that chance. We let Kingsley and company lay the ground work then we move in. Mr. Veeth, Miss Carla, that is my strategy. The same strategy that nearly got you caught by Solo and Kuryakin? Why not ask Mrs. Kingsley? 'She knows her husband.' 'If she agrees, will you take over?' I have already stated my position. Besides I need not remind you that Mrs. Kingsley is doing her part. Thanks to her, THRUSH is in on a scheme which will give it control of the world...forever. And I see no reason to burden her with additional problems. Why not let Mrs. Kingsley speak for herself? Mr. Webb and I have work to do. It's hot in here. 'Erikson's daughter Anna has also left Berlin.' 'You have their description, sir?' 'We're transmitting light beam photos right now.' 'And I do have a lead.' 'A girl answering Anna Erikson's descriptions ' 'is aboard Air East Flight 137' 'due to arrive at Hong Kong 1800 hours local time.' 'That's her. Anna Erikson. Alright, lads, cast off! Taxi, gentleman? Taxi? We just spotted the ship, sir. Well, that's something. 'What do you think you're doing?' I'm shooting down that helicopter, sir. Helicopter? What helicopter? That one over there. What's going on here? Who the devil are you? This is an illegal, unregistered, armed ship. We're from UNCLE. We have reason to believe you have 'Dr. Robert Kingsley, Dr. Kurt Erikson' 'and Anna Erikson on board.' 'We'd like to talk to them.' 'I don't carry passengers.' 'Then what do you carry that you have to' 'protect with a machine gun?' You committed an act of piracy. I have the right to defend my ship against pirates! Who are these men, captain? Anna Erikson, we'd like to talk to your father and Dr. Robert Kingsley. But I don't know where my father is. And the only Mr. Kingsley I know of is an English lyric poet long since dead. Then why are you on the ship? The only fact worth a penny, worth a cold gin is you're aboard my ship unlawfully UNCLE or no UNCLE. You are from UNCLE? UNCLE and so is Kingsley. I don't believe you. I don't either, Fraulein. A couple of born liars if I ever saw one. Now, don't you worry, your pretty little head. Why don't you pop off and.. ...play some kuffle ball or something. Alright, lads, take 'em! - Father, I have to... - Later, dear. Later. Later! Please come, please. 'THRUSH Central to Hong Kong.' 'Robert Kingsley and Dr. Erikson are safely on their way' 'to operational headquarters Himalayas.' 'Due to arrive at 0900.' Mrs. Kingsley, I hope your husband appreciates what you're doing for him. He will, Mr. Webb.. ...until he finds out who's supplying me. It's bright in here. 'THRUSH Central to Hong Kong.' 'General Harmon has been successfully recruited' 'as Kingsley's security chief.' 'and is departing for Himalayan base at 1200.' 'There is no comment. General has nothing to say.' 'No comments. No comments.' 'No comments. No comments.' 'The general has nothing to say. Nothing to say.' 'Are you leaving the country, general?' General, you must have something to say, general.. 'The general has no comment. No comment.' - No comment. - That's enough! That's enough! 'Are you leaving this country, general?' 'No comments, no comments.' General! General! General! - Hey! Whoa! - Hey, what's going on? Ten-hut! Men, when you were selected to serve me you took a personal oath of loyalty. I now invoke that pledge of unquestioning obedience. You are no longer in the service of the country we've just left. You are an elite security force. The last soldiers this world will ever see. Military history ends with you. Do your duty. See to it that it ends gloriously. Captain Gelser will give you the details and your new uniforms. Sounds very quite. I'll take a look around. See anything below? Nothing. 'Nothing on deck either.' I'll take a look up for it. Completely deserted. A touch of the Mary Celeste. Helicopter's been sabotaged. Is your communicator gone too? Fortunately, I have something up my sleeve. How do I inject dignity into the word "Help?" You don't. You swallow your pride and hope Mr. Waverly sends out a seaplane. 'Open Channel D, please.' A seaplane? Of course, gentleman. That's what I'm here for. Sir, Jan Vanovech an electronics expert has disappeared from Prague, Czechoslovakia. But before it disappeared.. ...a music box of his was stolen. A music box? Thank you for bringing it. You're very welcome, Dr. Vanovech. Now, tell me, what do you think? Mr. Kingsley, there was no need for you to kidnap me. If you had told me of your plan, if you had invited me 'I would have come running to help you achieve it.' Gentleman, I'm with you every inch of the way. Then...welcome to the purple. 'THRUSH Central to Hong Kong.' 'Electronics division reports.' 'Jan Vanovech kidnapped in Prague' 'according to plan at 0600.' 'Repeat.' 'Electronics division reports.' 'Jan Vanovech kidnapped in Prague' 'according to plan at 0600.' You had your way long enough, Webb. Now, it's going to be our way. THRUSH is going to take over Kingsley's installations 'and you are through.' And what will THRUSH Central say about this, Mr. Veeth? They'll thank us. 'THRUSH Central to Hong Kong.' 'Propaganda division reports.' 'Public relations expert Mr. Mackie kidnapped in London' 'according to plan at 0500.' 'THRUSH Central to Hong Kong.' 'Personnel division reports.' 'Dr. Naomi Fisher kidnapped in Tel Aviv' 'according to plan at 0700.' It's cold in here. But why Paul Mackie? Why would anyone want to kidnap a public relations man? And why take his desk calendar? No doubt for the same reason they took a musical box from Vaskovech. Sir.. ...another disappearance, sir. Dr. Naomi Fisher, from Tel Aviv. What does she do? She's the world's leading expert on food production. What was stolen of hers? An empty briefcase. 'What are we supposed to do?' 'Check every petty theft in the world?' Hey, what are you doing in here? Hey! Hey! Call the police! Hey, hey, hey. Call the police! '"Motiveless theft.' '"Police were baffled today by the strange theft' '"of a family photograph from the home' '"of Professor David Garrow' "166 Denslow Ave, Los Angeles. "Dr. Garrow, the world's most celebrated geneticist "was equally astonished. "I can't imagine the burglar's motive," he said." Another trivial theft from a VIP. Whose son was vacationing with Dr. Erikson and his daughter Anna. Fits the pattern. Quite, Mr. Solo. And which is gonna be our task to alter. Doing so is going to be highly dangerous, gentlemen. To you...and to Professor David Garrow. David, for heaven's sake, what's the hurry? We've got plenty of time. Darling, what's the matter? You always used to look forward to attending these conferences. I'm looking forward to this one. Then what is it? Is there anything else wrong? No, it's just that I don't like going away and leaving you two alone. Particularly after what happened to the house the other night. - We'll be alright, dad. - Well, maybe you will. - When are you gonna realize... - Look, when are you gonna... Oh, now, boys, please. Stop it. Now, we're all on edge. I know how worried you are about Anna's disappearance. And, David, I know you're.. Let's all try to relax, please. 'Announcing the arrival of flight 13 from London.' 'Gate 4. Flight 13 now arriving from London at Gate 4.' 'Passengers on Flight 128' 'the conference special, may now board at Gate 27.' 'Flight 128, the conference special is now loading' 'at Gate 27.' I wonder who that could be. I'll be right back. 'Please board now at Gate 27.' 'Will all passengers holding tickets for flight 128' 'the conference special, please report to Gate 27.' Hello? 'Hello, Hello.' 'Hello!' 'Hello?' Hello? 'Passengers on flight 128, the conference special' 'may now board at Gate 27.' 'Flight 128, the conference special is now loading' 'at Gate 27.' Dad, dad.. Get a doctor and an ambulance. Don't move him! Don't move him until you get a doctor and an ambulance. Steven, are you alright? Don't move. Somebody please get a doctor. Somebody's already gone for a doctor. I'm alright. Thank God. Where's dad? - What happened to dad? - Now be quiet, be quiet. 'Will Professor David Garrow' 'please report to Gate 27.' 'Flight 128, the conference special' 'is now in its final boarding stage.' Open Channel D. Yes, Mr. Solo. We were right, sir. Professor Garrow's been taken. We didn't interfere. Then proceed as planned. So you knew and still you persuaded my father to walk into a trap? Yes, Mr. Garrow. Your father has a small transmitter sewn into his clothing. 'Mr. Solo is following a signal from that transmitter' 'in another plane at this very moment.' Mr. Kuryakin, my husband is a scientist not a law enforcement agent. I can't believe that he would agree to being taken away. He is also a very brave man, Mrs. Garrow. And maybe very dead by now. Now no one's heard from the others who've disappeared. Hasn't it occurred to you that some nut may be murdering them? We discussed that with your father, Mr. Garrow. It's for you. Steven, open it, please. Why? Why? Blood money? Is it blood money, Mr. Kuryakin? 'I see.' 'Maintain watch.' It's the radar report. The UNCLE plane is still following. And there's...nothing else we can do? Casualties are inevitable, sir. Deal with it, general. It's the only way I guess. 'Missile defense unit.' We're 80 miles west of our last reported position and still over the Himalayas. Instead of snow there, uh.. We're under attack! I don't see any planes, it must be missiles. Alice.. Steve? No, professor. You are not at home in Los Angeles. Who are you? What.. What is this place? Why have you been brought here? Professor...I'm your new employer. I'm deeply concerned that your working condition should be familiar to you. 'Hence this, uh, detailed' 'painstaking reproduction of your office.' Ah.. As for your family, I shall send them $5000 every month. 'The first payment's already been made.' What's this all about? Professor.. ...you complete the team. You, I and five others we comprise the seven intellectual wonders of the world. Oh, it's quite simple, professor. You and your associates will help me to alter the course of destiny. And there by save the world from self-destruction. We are going to control in every way. In every detail.. ...the mind of every human being on Earth. Mr. Kuryakin's plane has taken off, sir. To look for Mr. Solo. He'll transfer to a helicopter when he reaches the crash area. 'Mr. Kuryakin.' I figured UNCLE could use some help looking for my father. I'm in. I will not work with you on this...unholy project. Professor Garrow. Professor, the homing device you carried has been discovered. The UNCLE plane following you, destroyed. Now forget all thought of rescue and devote your mind to this great task. The answer is still no. Not even to ensure the safety of your wife and son? Desert and bare mountains up here in the Himalayas? It's unusual. Legend has it, this is a rather unusual part of the world. That's no legend. It's Mr. Solo's plane. He must be dead. Listen, if you don't have anything positive to say why don't you just keep quiet? Open Channel D, please. Open Channel D. It's not working for some reason. Hey, look. There's more of it. Come on! Napoleon Solo, I could use a man like him. A spy by any name gets shot. No, general. That won't be necessary now. Mr. Kingsley you had me join this enterprise as your chief of security. If you insist on disregarding my advice.. Wiping out the opposition is no achievement, general. Any Brut with a gun can do that. No, I want him. I want him to approve of my plan. I could convince him. If you keep dangerous UNCLE agents alive to.. ...debate with them 'you're going to endanger this entire project.' Other UNCLE agents will follow him. We will assess each case if and when it arises, general. Missile defense unit. Yes, general. I want a saturation radar check over a 25 mile radius. Immediately, sir. Destroy anything that shows up. - Anything. - 'Yes, sir.' Could be his jacket. Well, that proves we're on the right track at least. Who was in that one, general? We don't know. It was necessary no matter who was in it. 'I couldn't risk that aircraft finding us.' 'You know I couldn't risk that?' You were an UNCLE agent, you've killed before when necessary. General, it was because I had to kill that I brought all this about, to create a world in which... Why do you think I'm here? To play soldier? Kill for the sake of it? I want that new world, too. That's why I'll protect this.. this splinter of that world from sabotage and invasion. Now, you must let me do my job no matter who dies. General, you are a strange mixture. You pursue a merciful ideal.. ...mercilessly. I'll take that as a compliment. 'THRUSH Central to Hong Kong.' 'Transportation center.' 'This is our final report.' 'The last cargo including drugs' 'to immobilize the defense force' 'is now within 100 miles of the Kingsley installation.' 'Repeat. This is our final report.' 'The last cargo including drugs' 'to immobilize the defense force' 'is now within 100 miles of the Kingsley installation.' Thank you. Mr. Webb will be happy to hear that. This is Mrs. Kingsley. Congratulations to all of you for a job well done. Now all we have to do is wait. Relax. Out. We've made it. You've had a pleasant rest, Mr. Solo. And a very pleasant awakening.. ...so far. Come with us if you please. Father, you must tell me what's going on. I cannot tell you anything now, please! 'I have work to do, I have meetings to attend to.' I just saw one of those UNCLE agents under guard. Why? That's not your concern, darling. Not your concern or mine. Concern? Father, do you realize that he's being kept a prisoner? Why? You know, your duty to me is obedience. You've been on confidential missions with me before.. ...without worrying me with questions. - Never one like this. - Please, don't question me now. - Please! - Never one like this. This one is different. This time I had to leave someone. Someone that.. ...I'm very fond of. I had to leave him without any explanation to come here because you told me so. I had to leave Steve Garrow. He must think I'm crazy. And now I feel as though I'm just never gonna see him again. And if that's the case I feel I have a right to know why or go back to him. You can't do that. I cannot tell you anything now. And you cannot go back. You intend, you seriously intend to make the whole world think and act the way you want it to? That's correct, Mr. Solo. By blanketing it with a docility gas Dr. Erikson has developed. 'The capsule you say you found in my office' was only a small sample. Mr. Solo, please consider, you and I, we have fought the seemingly endless battle against evil. Don't you see that this way, my way.. ...the battle ends once and for all in favor of good? It's a blasphemy. Your plan denies humanity its freedom.. ...to find its own way to better times. Walk out. 'Walk out. Kingsley can't operate without you.' 'You're the experts.' Solo, I'm a soldier. I realize just about every ambition of my profession except its abolition. Which is something I've prayed for from the.. ...time I saw my first battlefield casualty. Now, I for one.. ...am not going to walk out on the world's one chance to cleanse itself from the filth of war. You're not alone in craving peace, general. But your method of achieving... The method is certain. Peace assured forever by one radio broadcast from here ordering it. One...straight.. ...order. So you see, Mr. Solo no one's going to walk out. Professor Garrow you're a geneticist. Your life work is the biological improvement of man. Will you pervert that science into the creation of a.. ...of a generation of robots? Don't you realize that you're involved... I realize my wife and son will suffer.. ...if I don't cooperate. Please, I beg of you. Think over carefully, everything you've heard. Reconsider your conventional moral objections.. '...and join us' leading the new world. Let there be eight wonders. In your new world, Kingsley there won't be any wonder. 'Ten-hut!' - Sergeant, take the prisoner. - 'Yes, sir.' Follow me. You have been declared.. ...infiltrators and potential saboteurs. By virtue of the military authority vested in me.. ...I sentence you to immediate execution. Death by shooting. Captain Gelser. Ready. Aim! Steve! 'Fire!' Dad! That's my father! Dad! That's my father! Dad! Dad! He's dead. I can't...tell you how much I regret this. I can. General, I want him kept under custody in his father's quarters. Guard him, but don't harm him. 'Sergeant, take the prisoner.' Steve. Steve! 'What happened?' Steve, what happened? Steve! Stay away from me, you're with them! - Steve! - Stay here, now. You can't do anything, now. - Steve! - Stay here. The same goes for Solo and Kuryakin, general. Under guard in guest quarters until I send for them. - But, Kingsley.. - In guest quarters! - Captain Gelser. - Sir? Return the prisoners to their quarters. 'Take the prisoners to their quarters.' You're tying my hands. There'll be no more discussions, general. There'll be no more shootings. No more drum-head courts martial. 'No more killings. Is that absolutely clear?' - But... - No more! Dr. Erikson.. Dr. Erikson, how soon.. ...can we launch the gas? Well, I.. I've been thinking in terms of weeks. 'There's so many, uh..' ...technical details to take care of. Our schedule.. It's UNCLE's schedule that worries me. Agents dropping out of the sky. They've located our installation. 'Who knows what they're planning right now?' We need time. We cannot do this thing overnight. Dr. Erikson, we must expedite the attack. Gas UNCLE into obedience like everyone else. What's to happen to the prisoners? Nothing to young Garrow. 'I owe that much to his father.' And Solo and Kuryakin? 'May I suggest, Mr. Kingsley' that they be the first.. ...to go under the docility gas. Alright, general. 'Get them ready for the test chamber, now.' And the rest of the world.. ...within hours. Hours, Robert? 'That's right, darling.' 'As soon as Erikson's preparations are completed.' Now don't ask me any questions, please. Just believe me, this change of plan is essential. Alright, Robert. Whatever you say. 'Now, hurry, darling.' I will, Robert. And, Margitta.. ...I think of you every minute. Me too, darling. I haven't left the apartment in days waiting for your call. I love you. Goodbye, Robert. Why? Why has he advanced the attack time? Makes no difference. No difference? We'll never get the members of THRUSH Central to the installation on time. They'll be.. Gassed. Like everyone else. We go ahead exactly as planned. Only we do it sooner.. ...and without THRUSH Central. Just.. ...you and I? Just you and I. - Steve? - Get out. Steve, you have to listen to me. Get out of here. Steve, I'm not with those other people, you can... Get out of here! I'm not with those people, Steve! No! No! Well, then why did they let you come in here? Why did they let you have the run of the place? 'Cause right now, they're much more human than you are. Steve, don't you understand I wanna be with you? Oh, fine, you're with me. You're with me right here full of sympathy. Well, no flowers, by request! Just get out and leave me alone! You don't know what they're planning to do, Steve. Kingsley and the others... Kingsley and others killed my father! I wish my father was dead now so you wouldn't have to be.. ...part in this terrible plan. I'm telling the truth. Please, believe me. Oh, Steve.. Steve, your friends.. They're planning to give your friends some kind of gas. Everything is ready. Thank you, doctor. Send for Solo and Kuryakin. Captain Gelser.. Here. I took it out of my father's office. I don't know what good it's gonna do against all of them. Steve, there's a building at the end of the complex. It has all kinds of windows around it, and.. ...I think it could.. ...be some kind of control room. Can we get in? No. I know one thing.. ...I'd rather die than live in Kingsley's kind of world. So would I. Let's try. Let me out! Help! Drop it! Turn around. Wh-what happened? I don't know. Mr. Solo, Mr. Kuryakin you ought to be vanguard. Within hours, the world's millions will follow you into eternal and profitable obedience. Steve! Steve! Hand me a grenade. Erikson, stop that thing! Stop that thing! You've gotta stop it. I can't. It's irreversible. 'They've gotta be drugged.' Let's get to the airfield. Why don't you come out? I have not been told to. There's our friend, Mr. Webb. And poor, distraught, Mrs. Kingsley. Drugged. Every single one of General Harmon's men. And the closed-circuit television system has been sabotaged according to plan. May I congratulate you, major? You and your missile force comprise an excellent fifth column. Most complex engineering feat in history functioning perfectly and a television tube blows. Solo and Kuryakin have got to be stopped. Don't worry about it. They'll be taken. Start your power build up, Dr. Erikson. My wife will be here in a minute. Dr. Fisher. Dr. Vanovech. Mr. Mackie. It's time to go to our stations. Our moment is near. My deepest thanks to all of you. Robert, there's been trouble. Yes, but everything's alright now. Now that you're here. Robert.. ...you must meet your financial backer. Mr. Webb. Mr. Webb. You have financed the future of mankind. It was a bargain, Mr. Kingsley. Come, we must meet Dr. Erikson. He'll show you everything. 'That's our one chance.' Take the plane and use the concealed rockets. Use the jeeps. Drop them. Oh, yes, indeed. The gas does work, we know that. The general.. '...he was exposed to it quite by accident.' 'Look at him.' 'A perfect picture of docility.' 'The citizen of the new world already at peace.' I find all this quite fascinating, Mr. Kingsley. But, Dr. Erikson.. ...how does the equipment work? Of course, Mr. Webb. You see, when those seven tubes are completely filled.. '...these red strip lights will begin' 'to flash on simultaneously.' And that means that our power system is.. ...fully operative. Then we'll release this lever 'which will release the gas' by radio control, all over the world. And then? And then, Mr. Webb, every human being 'on Earth will be...' Ours. That's right. Ours. Thanks to THRUSH. 'Don't look so startled, Robert.' Where else do you think I raised a $100 million? An overdraft at a drive-in bank. - Margitta? - You're a fool, Robert. A sick fool. It all began when you started thinking you could save the human race. Well, you can't. Humanity is dirt. And it always will be. Believe me, I know. No, Margitta, you're wrong. I have the gun, and that proves I'm right. That's the reality of power. Poor Robert. You never understood that. You never learned that people don't want to be enlightened. They only respect the threat of the whip.. ...wielded by a master. And you were never a master, Robert. Margitta, for the love of God put that gun down! General, kill them! Margitta. Margitta? Margitta! Kingsley, the pressure is nearing maximum. ...must have went through. If they get by our men, they'll control it. We must speed up the power. Doctor, this is regulator. - We've got to... - That's the regulator! - We've got to.. - Don't do that! We've gotta make a direct hit on the operation's room, otherwise.. Otherwise a lot of innocent people get killed. - Doctor... - That's our only chance. We'll be blown to bits. Don't...do that! - 'It's done.' - 'We'll be blown to bits.' Give me that back! Give me back that key! If you're not prepared to risk your life for the plan then get out! Take the general with you. Get out! General, follow me. Better circle again. Now. Let's head for the airport. Mr. Solo, you and I we have fought the seemingly endless battle against evil. Don't you see that this way, my way ...the battle ends, once and for all in favor of good? Good job, gentlemen. Kingsley sincerely believed history would accept the same of him, sir. Quite, Mr. Solo. Quite. We will board the plane now, general.
