MIDAQ ALLEY MIDAQ ALLEY I'll lead with the Double Six. The Duke of Veragua. Damn! I'll play my double. Those who double on the first move... The Triple. This is a game for mutes. The check for table one, Mr. Ru. The change is 20, right? Twenty-one, Mr. Ru. You don't let one damn peso get away. Block you with my five. Shit partner! Watch what you're doing! I pass. "You pass the abyss of my sorrow like a moonbeam over the seas." For the Whistle... the Blonde. For the Blonde... the Whistle. Well, I'll bend to your Whistle like Mr. Ru does. Come on, Abel! This guy in Tijuana can smuggle us across in a blink. With no immigration bullshit. What do you say? - Your turn. - I'm talking to you. - Play! - Answer me. I told you I don't want to leave, Chava. What for? You're going to spend your life cutting hair for those assholes? Bullshit, man. What do you mean? I'll have my own hair salon. Your turn. "My life winds down, and yours just begins. Harder to leap across the hedgerows than to fill the sea with moon glow. You pass the abyss of my sorrow..." Enough bullshit, Ubaldo. Pay attention! It's not bullshit. It's Amado Nervo. Amado Nervous, my ass! You see? Damn you, Ubaldo. I pass. Are you going to spend all day goofing off? It's Sunday, Dad. We work Sundays too! Why the fuck not? I work all week to feed you. You think money grows on trees? Let's go, man! Where are the rum bottles? Tomorrow, Dad! Don't you... Don't answer me like that or I'll kick your ass. Damn it, I told you already! I'm warning you. I'm sick and tired of you two! Always together! You even go to the bathroom together! People will think you're a couple of queers. You hear me? That's what you look like! Queers! Mr. Ru, what a fuss! What's your problem? I told you one was with soda. Get your orders straight, asshole! I'm also fucking fed up with you! Go on! Mr. Ru, that's no way to talk to a son, much less in public. I can't stand him anymore. Like the poet said... How did Amado Nervous say it, Ubaldo? "In this world we're all asses who bray. Some more male, others more gay." Okay, now it's my turn. See why I want to go, Abel? - Why, Chavita? - See how he gets? Oh, come on, all parents are the same. What do you know? You don't have any. That's how they are. This is it. It's all you need to make it there. - What's this? - Basic English, fool. Use it. I'm on Book Two. "Boo Too"! Give me a break. - No, Chavita, I'm not into this. - What? - What's up, Chava? - What's up? You're not going home to crash, are you? I thought we were gonna go with Toña. Some other day. Okay, get the joint. My dad really upset you. I don't have any. But you do. Reginito, the smart ass. That's why I love you. Did you let it out to Almita? Not yet. You're such brown trash. If you don't clean up your act fast... you'll blow it. She aims high. It's a matter of reaching her. - How, man? - By flying. Then fly, bastard. And here's the King to round out the good omens. See you around. The answer to your question is yes. That's great, Mrs. Cata. We're finished, Susanita. - Bye. - Bye, Susanita. - Will you hand me my box? - Oh, I almost forgot it. See you later. And don't forget our second session. - No. Bye, Mrs. Cata. - Bye, Susanita. She's hot, red hot. God! Still flirting with him? - With who? - "With who." Never fall in love with a beggar. They're just as much work. Woman! I'm home. I'm starving. Has Chava arrived? Where's Chava? Eusebia! Darn! Didn't you hear me? Chava went to Toluca to get the liquor. He'll be back tomorrow. He'll be back tomorrow. He promised me he'd help out at the bar. I hope so. Who did you invite to dinner? Nobody. You and I are going to have an intimate dinner. Where are you going dressed like that? A carnival, or what? I bought this dress yesterday. Don't you like it? Yes, it looks good on you. Rutilio, do you know what today is? No, I don't remember. It's our anniversary. What anniversary are you talking about? We've been married 30 years. So we're going to have a great dinner. Your favorite: avocado soup and beef in pipián sauce. But first, a surprise. Close your eyes. What a bitch. Your anniversary gift. Open it. - Do you like it? - Yes. It's nice. We'll have a nice imported white wine with dinner. It's chilling in the fridge. And then... we'll just see what happens. Honey... you just take it easy. I'll take care of everything. Shit... I just lost my appetite. Did you notice my new nightgown? Yes, I did. Rutilio? Rutilio? What do you want? Remember when I got pregnant with the girls? And with your favorite son? Just look how he turned out. He'll behave himself. He told me so. We'll see how long he keeps his promise, the lazybones. Rutilio? Do you remember what you did to get me pregnant? You enjoyed it so. Calm down. Come on, Rutilio. But, woman, we're too old for that now. Why? It's been so long since you touched me. Come on. Well... all right. Come on. Oh, baby! Hung over again, asshole? Get back here! You dirty drunk. Good morning, Mr. Rutilio. Asshole. But you'll come back, son of a bitch. Damn alcohol. - What did you need, ma'am? - Beefsteaks. - How many? - One kilo. So, where is the barber? Over there! Abel! Get to work, you lazy bum. Sorry, Mr. Ru. - Did I keep you waiting? - It's okay. Just a trim. Get the gray hairs especially. I want to look younger, if that's possible. Of course, Mr. Ru. Slow down, you've got all the time in the world. Today is my day off. - Is Chava taking care of the bar? - Yes. I can't trust Güicho. I can only take my days off when Chava works. You deserve them, Mr. Ru. So, you're Almita's boyfriend. I've had my eye on you. Her boyfriend, boyfriend... Well, not quite yet. Why not? Almita should be very happy with you. You're better looking than she is. Don't say that, Mr. Rutilio. Of course you are. Listen, Abel, women are very difficult indeed. At my age, one gets bored and tired of them. They become intolerable. That's when you have to look for other things. New ways to be happy... New interests, new feelings, new emotions... You understand me, don't you, Abel? Sure do, Mr. Ru. - Good morning. - Good morning. We're at your service. Thank you. I'd like to see some socks like the ones in the window. They're imported, Italian. We have them on sale. They come in a variety of colors and designs. You can select them. I see you have good taste. Why not select a half dozen for me? The ones you like best. I'd select these, these... and some with designs. - How's that? - Whatever you say. Do you have any underpants? Briefs or boxers? I don't know. Which do you find more comfortable? I prefer briefs. They fit better. Okay. You never told me if we're going out. - You ran off. - Mr. Ru was waiting. Can't you even say good-bye? I'm sorry, Almita. I'm sorry. Here, let me help you. So, are we going to the park? We can get there early, rent a rowboat, go to the zoo. You're so tacky. - See you tomorrow. - Get some rest. Young man. We meet again. What a coincidence. - How are you, sir? - Fine. Going to rest? Going home? Do you live far? Alone? In Portales, with my mother. - I take the subway. - I'll go with you. - Don't trouble yourself, sir. - Don't call me "sir." My name is Rutilio. It's an awful name, I know. My friends call me Mr. Ru. What's your name? Jaime Paredes. My friends call me Jimmy. You're an intelligent and educated boy. Jimmy, anytime you like, or when you get off work, stop by my bar. Los Reyes Antiguos. It's nearby, in MIDAQ Alley. Have a drink and we can chat. I'll go next week. Oh, look! - A little gift. - I can't accept it, really. You can. It's the socks. You picked them out as if they were for yourself. I can't accept them. Don't say that. Take them as a sign of our friendship. Okay. Thank you. - Bye. - I'll wait for you. Don't forget, Los Reyes Antiguos. Here in MIDAQ Alley. "Oh, Kempis, Kempis, sterile ascetic, feeble ascetic..." "You hurt me bad. I've been sick for a long time." You lose your rook. "And it is because of the book you wrote." Come on, play, stinking poet. Mr. Ru, someone lost this. - You stole the money, didn't you? - Don't insult me. Someone's here to see you. Jimmy! What a surprise! Come in! I thought you'd never come. You said one week. Well, my mom got sick. I'm so sorry. But come in. I have an exquisite Spanish brandy. - Anything you like. - You choose. I'll give you something sensational. Look at Mr. Ru. What did I tell you? "Oh, Kempis, Kempis, sterile ascetic..." I'm back, Dad. I'll stay and close up. No, I'll stay. Run along. You were going to the movies. Yes, but I'll close up. Take the night off. Need any money? No. "I kissed those lips which a kiss invited. The golden braids, the big eyes. Not remembering everything fades away." Ubaldo. What are you doing here, Eusebia? What's the matter? I'm living a terrible tragedy. Tragedies are things of Sophocles. Come in, please. Who told you? I still don't understand. Everyone knows. He's shameless. And in public. Please calm down. Chava, his own son, saw him in the bar with that... young boy. He says he goes there every night. Haven't you noticed? Well, yes... But it's nothing more than friendship. Don't play dumb, Ubaldo. That's not friendship. Then let's call it... platonic love. What's that? It comes from Plato. Platonic love, an ideal love. Nonphysical. Nonphysical? Nonsense, Ubaldo. It's called queering, here and in China. Queering! What a disgrace. How shameful for me and the children, Ubaldo. Don't cry, Eusebia. I'll talk to him, and that should take care of it. No, it won't. Yes, it will. I promise you. I swear it. Good evening, Güicho. We're not serving, poet. It's closing time. I must speak to Rutilio. Isn't he in? He's in the back. In the warehouse. Which warehouse? Around back. He's busy. You know who with. I must speak... Excuse me. Thank you. ...with you, Rutilio. Yes? This thing that's going on... can't continue! - What's going on? - This! This young boy. Your wife is beside herself, and with good reason. "This sin of sodomy," says Dante... Listen, fucking philosopher. Neither you nor that whore has any right to interfere. Damn it! It's my life, and I'll do what I fucking feel like. No! Dante says so! Mind your own business. If I screw Jimmy, Güicho, Fidel or whomever, it's just my pleasure! These are Dante's judgments! Dante and you can go fuck your mother! That, or I'll fuck you both! Who needs this. - No, please, don't hit me! - Bitch! - Why did you tell him? - I'm sorry! Fucking woman, I'm going to kick your ass! This will teach you, bitch! No, please! - Five. - Five? Shampoo, please. Wait, wait. My turn. Easy now. Does it feel nice? You son of a bitch! Stay away! You're going to kill him! Leave him! You'll kill him! Look what you did! Jimmy! Abel! Abel, damn it! Come here, man! Come, damn it! Don't fuck me, Chava! I gotta talk to you, man. - You know what happened? - No. What? I messed up bad, man. Stand up for me. Son of a bitch. - Did you kill him or what? - I have no idea. I left. I've been hiding all day. What will you do? Let's go to Tijuana. It's time to start a new fife. Can't you see Alma's crazy about me? She fell for me. It won't last, pal. If you really want her, you'll need lots of cash. To marry her, you'll have to come back with bucks. You go! You're running. Why me? I have no choice. But come with me. Going alone sucks. With two of us, it's no hassle. No, Chava. No. Don't do this to me, Abel. Don't screw me up. Did he die? You'd like that, wouldn't you? It would make you happy. No, he didn't die. Just a cracked skull. The Red Cross will release him tomorrow. That's God's will. But I'll break his neck, that fucking son of yours. If he shows his face, he'll see who I really am. I'll have that asshole in jail! Chava's gone. He better not try and hide, or it'll be worse for him. And tell your daughters not to help him or I'll come looking for them too. He ran away to the States. Sure, he did. He went with Abel. They both left. You're lying, bitch. Chava's never coming back. He told me. My son... You lost him, Rutilio. You lost him. You'll never see him again. Never! That's not true. Chava, my son... My only son. Damn son of a bitch! Asshole! Chava! My son left us alone, woman. He left us alone! Goddamn son of a bitch! Murderer! Damn shit you created! Chava! My dearest son, woman! He left. He left us alone. I'll lead with the Double Six. The Duke of Veragua. Damn! I'll play my double. Those who double on the first move... - The Triple. - The Triple? Double for the Triple. This is a game for mutes. Susanita, come in. Make yourself comfortable. Let me have your things. Remind me later. I can be so absentminded. Which do you prefer? Spanish deck or tarot? For the first session, we'll use the Spanish deck. Turn off that radio. Can't you see I have work? - Oh, Mom. Who is it? - Who else? Susanita. - I'm afraid, Mrs. Cata. - No, you're doing fine. Like this? Show me your left hand. Now, repeat... For me. For my home. And for what may happen. Very good. Your hand again. I'm so nervous, Mrs. Cata. You must relax. Concentrate. Love keeps no secrets from the cards. Don't cross your legs, please, Susanita. - Do you mind if I smoke? - Not at all, Mrs. Cata. - A cigarette? - I don't smoke, thank you. Bye, sweet Alma. One moment, Mr. Macario. I'll be right back. - Almita! - Hey, man, I'm in a hurry. Why won't you talk to me? What do you want? I don't even know you. Remember 15 years ago? We got married at the fair. I was dumb and silly. Wearing panties all frilly. You cheap smart aleck! Move! Here, so we can start a new friendship. - What is it? - A poster for your collection. I stole it from the video store. Nice, isn't it? I can't be carrying it around. I'll take it to your house, and we can talk a while. My mother doesn't like you, Abel. I don't either. And then? No, sister, he was trembling. He couldn't open his fly. And then? Well, to be honest, he behaved very well. But what did he do to you? How does it feel? Well, nice, Almita. What do you mean, nice? Nice, how? Just nice. It's something you can't miss. At your age, you can't still be a virgin. How embarrassing. Seriously, I'd be embarrassed. I don't have anybody to do it with. And the boy you told me about? No, he's serious. It's not like you'll marry him. What's the big deal? Screw him for a while, and then find someone better. Is he handsome at least? Kind of. As good sons go, he's a good son. Fucking lazy, but he's my only son, Fidel. I'll leave everything to him. My daughters? Let their husbands care for them. You love him a lot, don't you? Chava, I mean... Yes, even if he doesn't realize what his father does for him. He's helping out at the bar, isn't he? Sort of. One day yes, the next day no. Almita. Come in, Almita. - What do you like? - I'm just looking, Mr. Fidel. That's why, feel free. What caught your eye? Those. They're real pretty. They go with the necklace. It's from Pakistan, from a shipment I just received. - Let's see how it looks. - Mr. Fidel, don't bother. For God's sake, child. - Good day, Mr. Ru. - Almita. - How's your mom? - Fine. Has she really been reading the cards for Susanita? Yes. Tell her to charge a lot to that greedy old spinster. Here, try it on. No charge for that. Oh, no, Mr. Fidel. It's made for a pretty girl like you. Okay, let's see. It shines on you. It looks lovely. It really is beautiful. But for me...? Not even in my dreams. Have the barber guy buy it for you. She's not for him. Come on, Rutilio. Alma needs a real man. With experience. Thanks for your trouble, Mr. Fidel. It's a pleasure, beautiful. - Bye, Mr. Ru. - Bye, Almita. Man, she is developing into something else. - What? - This thing has stones. See why I wanted to take you to the park. But I don't like to eat there. And it's too far. Chava wants me to go to the States with him, but I don't want to. Maybe he's right. - They say you make lots of money. - No. I saw a barbershop for lease in Portales. It's small, but clean. Well-equipped. I can quickly turn it into a beauty parlor. Sure, with what? I have some savings. I'm going to talk to Zacarias. - Who? - Zacarias, the beggar king. That filthy old man won't help you. I'll give it a try. Maybe I'll make him my partner. Abel, you're crazy. I'm trying to tell you that I won't just stand with my arms crossed. I'm going to struggle, to improve myself. I want to offer you more security. Hold it right there! We are just getting to know each other. I've known you all my life. Ever since I wore frilly pink panties. Since then. Abel... - I want to ask you a question. - Whatever you want. Are you a virgin? What? Are you a virgin? Have you ever slept with women? Why do you ask? To get to know you. Weren't you saying? Well, yes... I have certain experience. Tell me. - It's not worth it. - Oh, come on. I only love one woman. You. How about a movie? - We didn't plan on that. - It just occurred to me. How about it? If it's a nice picture, yes. I brought you a gift. It's really neat! Put it on me. Now can I say you're my girlfriend? No, man. Not yet. I'm home. See anything new? Mr. Fidel just sent them over to me. Can you believe it? They're expensive. Here, zip me up. I'm off to thank him right away. I always suspected he wasn't indifferent, but... He's such a fine and educated man. I just never thought... Since your father died, he's had his eyes on me. Eusebia always said so. But me... - How do I look? - Very nice. I think maybe I shouldn't wear them, right? No, too daring. Now what's missing? Why not use the ones you always wear? Right, the pearls. They're more discreet. If I'm a little late, don't worry. If Susanita shows up, tell her I'll see her another day. Almita? Would you mind if I got married again? Wish me luck. I only came to thank you. You shouldn't have bothered. Please, Catalina, don't mention it. The jewels are very fine. I noticed. I'm so glad you appreciate them. I appreciate them very much. You see, the other day, Almita stopped by here... She liked them so much... Well, I dared to send them as a gift for her. I'd like to speak frankly with you, once and for all. But, do me a favor, have a seat. How about a coffee, a sweet sherry? - A glass of port? - No, no, thank you. I'll get to the point, Catalina. You know that I am a respectable widower. I'm convinced I can, and should, remake my life. I'm well set economically, and don't doubt I can be... an exemplary husband for your daughter Alma. Cata? Cata, is anything the matter? Eusebia. Oh, Cata. Catita. Oh, Eusebia. And here's the good one, partner. Come on, my poet, this isn't chess. - Change for table three. - Get it yourself, man. That doesn't mean a thing. Did you at least touch her breasts or her ass? Damn, Chava, don't be an ass. - What? - Almita's respectable. Almita respectable, man? They're all the same. Don't give me that crap. We're going to the movies this afternoon. That's your chance. Güicho, let's have another round! I'm buying. As my friend said, "Close with a double blank and never lose." Closed. Add up, fuckers! More than 20 here. We blanked them again! They're pissing in their pants. Mr. Fidel, we're no good. Unlucky at games, lucky at love. Could be, dirty old man. Damn poet, you don't have any air left for one verse. One last round. To get even. Look who just showed up. The queen parties tonight! Okay, sixes lead. Do you have it? - Right here. - Come on then. "If you tell me, 'Come, ' and I drop everything, I won't even turn back my lover there to see. Let me hear it loudly above the din..." Come now, man, and push the sword in! What's the matter, poet? Don't get nervous. Fill the glasses. You always bring them half empty. Bye, sugar pie! Who's that guy? Do you know him? Fucking queer. I'm looking for a guy named Abel. Thank you. Hello. What's up, baby? Are you Abel? Glad to meet you. I'm Alma's friend. Guess what? She won't be able to go to the movies. Why, is she sick? Yes, real sick. No, seriously, her mother sent her on an errand. That's all I came to say. Bye. Who's that girl? You've got to introduce me. She's Alma's friend. What a foursome we'll make. - What happened? - Done. What did he say? Nothing, no problem. He'll just take another girl. No, seriously, he said... What did he say? He didn't say a thing. He just had this dumb look. Poor guy, Maru. That wasn't nice. No, you have to do that so they'll get excited. Do you know what movie we're going to see? All the films at the Savoy are pure sex. Really wild. Look, sister, what a hunk. - Let's ask him for a ride. - You're nuts! Don't start. There's the cab. Hi! - Let's sit in the front. - I don't want to go with you. Come on, let's go. So, did you find a partner? The good stuff. - How much? - Ten pesos each. Export quality. Take care. Got you! Pot, isn't it? Yes. Come on. Let it go. Exhale. You'll pass out. Let it out now. Leave me alone. Not like that, silly. If you smoke, I can too. Not like that. Pass it over. It'll hit you real hard. Great. That's what I want. To feel... To feel you, Abel. I want to feel you, Abel. What's your problem? I'm giving myself to you, and you really... This is not the way, Almita. Not like this. I really like you, Abel. Then why not tell me you love me? Abel! - What? - Come here. I'll be right back. Chava's in deep trouble. I won't be long. Open up. You're crazy, Abel. What's the matter? - I'm sorry, I want to speak to you. - The last I remember, you left me on the roof waiting. Chava had a fight with his dad. He has to leave for the States right now. And I'm going with him. You're what? I'm going to the other side. I'll never do anything here. I didn't get the lease on the barbershop. I'll be a nobody, like you said. I need money to marry you. Mom will overhear. I love you more than anything in the world, Alma. It doesn't seem so. You're leaving. I swear it won't be more than a year. I have to wait a year! Please tell me it's all right. As soon as I'm back, we'll get married. Look, you're wearing the bracelet. Wait. Something to remember me by. Tell me you'll wait. All my life, Abel. May God bless you. You didn't even screw him before he left? What a weird guy. He had you ready, and he leaves? He's gotta be gay. Seriously, he's weird. No. He left because of me. Because he really loves me. They never come back. They catch a gringa and you never see them again. I don't think so. He's not that way. You were falling for him. I have to forget him. I have to forget him. With the old man. It's the only way. There, you look a little older, a bit more serious. The earrings and necklace make you shine. You're lovely, dear. Mature men have that advantage. They don't waste time. They don't come to play. - But you liked Fidel, Mom. - Don't be silly. You told me. How punctual! - Come in, Mr. Fidel. Welcome. - Thank you. Almita, you're lovely. Good evening, Mr. Fidel. Forget this "Mr." stuff. Fidel, just plain Fidel. I took the liberty of bringing some gifts for Almita. Would you be so kind... Let's see what you think. How nice! See if you like what's in this box. Mr. Fidel! So much stuff. You're a splendid man. She really needed them so, the poor thing. Sit down, please. Make yourself at home. Would you like a liqueur? No, Catalina, I'm fine. I'll just leave you two to talk. The dress is lovely. A cup of coffee, Mr. Fidel? All right. - Sugar? - No, no. No sugar. The diabetes. I'm sure we'll get along very well. I only want to make you happy. To please you. What do you like? The opera? The theater? The symphony? The ballet? Movies, Mr. Fidel. These are wonderful. I like the bow on this one. And the train... - Very elegant, isn't it? - Yes. This is the one! She'd look divine in it. Do you like it, Almita? Do you? Enough said. Almita? I'll total it. You're adding too many points. Adding points... Come on. My pen, damn it. Güicho. Find my pen. The gold one. - It's not here, Mr. Ru. - Look for it! It's there! Looks like they plucked you. I'll pluck you too. I'm really revved up, Rutilio. Almita brings you luck, Fidelito. The fucking barber took off running. No cock, that little queer. - You're really going to marry Almita? - In two weeks! Don't play dumb. You're all invited to one hell of a wedding reception! Your turn, Rutilio. - Don't be sad. Your son will be back. - Don't mention that asshole! I miss the poet's verses. What happened to him? He picked a fight with Mr. Ru here. I don't want to see that jerk in my bar. I'll break his jaw! - Why? - What's it to you? What an attitude, Rutilio. You'll both make up at my wedding, you'll see. Forget it, Fidel! I might even kick your ass too. Pass! The ass-kicker here, with all due respect, Mr. Ru, is me. And I'll do it with this domino. I'll go out with a bang, and I close the game. What a move! Fidel! What's the matter, Fidel? What's the matter, Fidel! - Get a doctor! - Wait, the tie! "Who knows in which hidden and hostile abyss... your beating white wings are overturned? Who knows in which murky and deserted spaces? Oh, Father of the living, where go the dead? Where go the dead, Lord? Where?" Straight to fucking hell, poet! Where else? What did Fidel leave Alma? Not a dime. Everything was left in the children's names. There they are. God spare me! He left her dressed up with nowhere to go. Poor too, which is worse. Look at your mother. She's so sad. She's probably the only one who's really sorry. Doesn't it bother you? Who is he? I don't know. He's really handsome. Isn't he the one in the car when we... I need some fresh air. - I'll go with you. - No, wait here. Sad? You were going to marry him. He died. "When dead buy the farm, we the living party on." - As my mother said. - Why are you spying on me? I'm not spying. I'm looking for you. Because I like you. What are you doing, Almita? - Do you want to have dinner with us? - No, I already ate. Okay. Good night. Good night. I'd like to talk to you in a quieter place. - Have dinner with me. - I can't. Don't be afraid of me. I only want to talk. I'm not afraid of you. I just can't. Why? - Good night, Almita. - Good night, Agapito. Alma, child, open the door. Can't you see I'm working? It's a phone call for you. Long distance. For me? From the United States. Hello? Abel, is that you? Hello! Speak louder. I can't hear you. Where are you? Houston? Where's that? I miss you too. Yes, I love you too. You just can't talk about marriage from far away. I told you, I miss you. Yes, I'll wait. Hello? Abel? Hello? I think we got cut off. Hello? That's too bad. Well, that's that. He's doing fine. Thank God. Thank God. He wants to come back and marry me. That's so exciting, Almita. So exciting! So, then...? - I'll pay you later. - Don't worry. - Have fun. - Thanks, Susanita. - What's up, Almita? - Hey, Almita. You're looking so cute. - Are you ready? - I'll tell my mom we're leaving. No, get in. It's late. What a bummer, I lost. Damn weak horse. Which won, sweetheart? This one? - Seven? - Seven! Seven, Seven... You won? You won! I told you, all I need is some luck. I'll give it to you, and I'll tell you how. You're so sweet. - You deserve better. - Fernando says, "Superb." He'll call later. Here, collect this for the girl. You're lucky. Let yourself go. Loosen your body. Close your eyes. Alma, life has so much to offer you. Money... Love... What are you thinking about? About what you're saying. I'm dreaming. Here is where the dream comes true. Thanks. - Was your dinner good? - Yes, it was delicious. I want to tell you something but don't laugh. I've never been in such an elegant place before. These are the kind of places you deserve. Not that awful neighborhood where you live. But that's my world. A girl like you can aspire to much more. Like what? You could be a model, or a film star, something big. You know about those things? Here's my card. Call me anytime. Won't we see each other anymore? We can see each other as often as you like. What's important is that you never lose trust in me. No, José Luis, not at all. You've been so good to me. Cheers. To your beauty. Cheers. - Going out again? - With Maru, Mom. A letter from Abel arrived this morning. Ever since Fidel died, I've been thinking a lot about you and Abel. You hated him. I can be very foolish. Abel is the best man for you. Really. Not some old rich guy. Or a swinger like the one you've been seeing. No. A good man. Someone who loves you... Mom, I'll be home late. Don't wait up. - You live here with your parents? - No, I live alone. In this huge house? Only in part of it really. In my apartment. The rest of it I share with friends. I'll open it. This is my little empire. A place awaiting a queen. What are those noises? My friends. Real party people. José Luis. What's the matter? No, I'm busy. Yes, so tell me. What else? That's a shitty thing to do! No, I didn't order that! A lot of passion, isn't it? Curiosity killed the cat. This is not a decent house, José Luis. Alma, you're all that matters to me. This is a whorehouse. No, Alma, you're wrong. Whores are butterflies who work in the streets. Hookers screw in cheap hotels. You know them. They're from your part of town. The women of this house are called courtesans. They are elegant ladies. They have experience, they have money, clothes, cars. They own homes. They have position. You deceived me, fucker. You deceived me. You shameless bastard, you lied to me, fucker! You're here of your own free will. Because you want me, honey. Let me go! - You can leave anytime. - Well, then, right now! The chauffeur downstairs can give you a ride. I don't need him. You'll be back, Alma. Never. Never! You know the world I offer you is marvelous. What an hour to come home! My heart's been in my throat! Girl! Answer me, child! I'm not picking in the fields anymore. It was awful. A countryman got me a job at a barbershop. They tried me out, and they liked my work. I should make good money to come back and marry you. That's all I think about. Marrying you, and loving you very much. My whole life long. In my room at nights, I spend hours looking at your photo, thinking you love me too, and that you'll wait. Almita, are you coming to mass? I'm so glad to see you here. Young people no longer stop by church. It's so comforting. God gives us such peace when we visit Him. Come in. Are you a virgin? No. Mrs. Cata... What happened? I searched the Red Cross, the police station, Maru's... And her friends too. Nobody knows a thing. I made some calls too. Güicho knows a policeman. Maybe he can help. It's been two days, Susanita. I just don't know who else to ask. I'll lead with the Double Six. The Duke of Veragua. Damn! I'll play my double. Those who double on the first move... The Triple. The Triple? Double for the Triple. - This is a game for mutes. - I didn't say anything. Now you only owe me for last month. I told you I'll give it to you next week. Fine, Mrs. Flor. But please, no later than that. No. Bye. Mrs. Cata. Not this month. You'll have to wait. It's not about the rent. Don't worry. I want to talk to you. It's something personal. All right, tell me. I'm embarrassed to tell you. Why? I've had such strange dreams. - Like nightmares? - Nothing like that. I dream about a man who is pursuing me. He looks me over. Then, he touches me. Does it mean anything? I don't know. I'd have to ask the cards. Do you think the cards can help me? The cards will reveal all. Is it expensive? May I? Let's see... Two sessions. One month of rent. No, Mrs. Cata, it's too expensive. Oh, for God's sake. - Could we do it now? - Surely, Susanita. Feel free, come in. The place is a mess, but make yourself at home. For me. For my home. And for what may happen. Very good. Again, let's see your left hand. I'm so nervous, Mrs. Cata. You must relax. Concentrate. Love keeps no secrets from the cards. Don't cross your legs, please, Susanita. - Do you mind if I smoke? - Not at all. - A cigarette? - I don't smoke, thank you. All right, let's see what we have here. Of course, the Ace of Coins, very important, a good sign. It means good fortune. The Horse of Swords. A man approaching you at a gallop. Are you a Virgo, Susanita? You know I never married, but when I was younger, well, the boy from the dry cleaner's and I... - When is your birthday? - June 8. Gemini! Of course. See how the Ace of Coins shines upon the Horse. - Did you see? - Yes. What does the Joker mean? It's not a Joker. It's the Jack of Clubs. A good sign. And here's the King to round out the good omens. It's very clear. Very clear. There is a man about to appear in you life. With good intentions? With passionate intentions. - Oh, Mrs. Cata. - You'll see, I'm not lying. Son of a bitch! Fucking water tank! What's the matter, Chava? "What's the matter"? There's not a single drop of water! If you want to wash up, I have a shower at my place. Feel free to use it. If I don't have water, you don't either, right? Right. Listen, Chava. - What? - Who are you for? What do you mean? Which soccer team? America or Guadalajara? Someone gave me two tickets for the classic game. Would you like to come with me? Susanita... I have to work at my dad's bar. Too bad. - Maybe next time. - Sure. - Hey, Chava. - What is it? Haven't your admirers told you how handsome you've become? - Oh, come on. - No, really. You fucking pig! Oh, you horny woman! - That's how I like you. - I'll tell Macario, asshole! Tell him. If God knows, might as well tell everyone else. I'll turn you in to the police. I'll tell them about you. You'll be mine, even if you don't want to, honey. - I'll put you in jail, asshole. - Get mad. It turns me on. Fuck you! Drop dead, you son of a bitch! Get out of here, asshole! The answer to your question is... yes. The tarot tells me the same thing. A man is just about to come into your fife. - Could it be true? - The cards don't lie. Fine, if you give me my rent receipt, we'll be even. Of course, it's right here. - Listen, Mrs. Cata... - Yes? Could it be Chava? - Who? - Chava, Mr. Ru's son. I just feel he looks at me with a certain passion. He's so low-class. All he thinks about is going to the US. I hope he does, and that he takes that barber who's always sniffing after Almita. Mrs. Cata, how does one find a man? Well, leave it to fate. And if fate takes too long? I'm not a young woman. Well, a magic prince isn't in a hurry. The truth is, Chava looks a lot like the man in my dreams. I wouldn't know. - Bye, Mrs. Cata. - Okay, Susanita. - Take care. - Thank you. - You're 20 pesos short. - The cop raised the payoff. Are you trying to fool me? I own that fucking cop. The mayor doesn't want fire-eaters in the street. Pay your fee or you don't work my territory again! Heard me? Now I got nothing. Then get to work. Look, here's the kid. No, he looks too healthy. Don't feed him till you're done working. Make him hungry so people feel pity for him. This shawl has to be filthy. This is serious, professional work. Understood? I told you to change the shawl. It gets worse every day. Look, only 150 pesos. Who is it? - Chava! - Susanita! - What's going on? - You have to save my life! I'm begging you. I heard your father is looking for you. He's furious, Chava. I have to go to Tijuana, but I'm broke. I have no one. Please. - What happened? - Please don't ask. I'll pay you back. It's a matter of life or death. How much do you need? 3,000 pesos. New pesos? Please, Susanita. I'll pay you back double. I don't have that much. I'll do whatever you like, anything. All right, Chava. Let me see. Damn cold. Shit! This bar isn't profitable anymore. I'll close it. We paid for the beer and two months of gas. Hold it. These totals are wrong. We're 200 pesos short. Do you think I'm an idiot or what? Look here, stupid. This should be seven, not five. You didn't think I'd notice, right? Always the same shit. There must be a mistake, Mr. Ru. Mistake? So where do you have the cash, asshole? Wait, sir. Something happened. You're robbing me, Güicho. I've known it all along. You can deduct it from my paycheck, Mr. Rutilio. Of course I will, jackass! What did you think? And if I catch you again, I'll put you in jail. Now, get out! You abandoned the bar! No, I didn't. My cousin stayed. - What? - My cousin. He's worse than you. Get out, and leave that! How will I finish? I don't give a shit how. Now, get out! Stupid! My God! Watch where you're going! Don't you have eyes? Look at my flowerpot. - I'm sorry. I'll pay for it. - I just bought it. Where did you get hurt? Silly. Let me help you. Don't be stubborn. Can't you see you can't walk? What a mess! All right, sit down. I'll take your shoes off so you can put your feet up. - I'll pay for it, lady. - That doesn't matter now. - It hurts a lot? - Yeah. - I'll give you a massage. - Don't trouble yourself. Take off your pants. Tell me if it hurts. Yes. Just a little. Does your leg hurt too? A little. Is that any better? Here, bend it a bit. How old are you? Twenty-six. So young. Do you feel any better? Yes. A lot. I'd never been in Mr. Ru's bar before. Do you like it? I like knowing where you work. I'm almost done, Susanita. Hey, Güicho. Don't call me Susanita. Susana... makes me feel more like a woman. I'll finish up. - Do you always close this early? - No. I told the clients I was going to fumigate so I ran them out early. To see me? I'm wearing a new dress. Where will you take me dancing? Right here. How original. Yes, isn't it? Do you like me, Güicho? If anything about me bothers you, let me know. Well, your teeth. Who would Mr. Fidel have left all his money to? To his children. Poor Almita. But she's going out with some boy, right? Those beatings Mrs. Flor gives Macario are really... Open wide, Susanita. Just look at your teeth. Your mouth is a mess. When will my new teeth be ready, Doc? - When do you need them? - For my wedding. When is it? As soon as Güicho's parents arrive from Guaymas. In about a month and a half. - That long? - Hold on. Rinse! Hello? Yes, it's me. Zacarias! Glad you called. I need to speak with you. Things are getting too hot. I'll see you there. Don't let me down. Will my teeth be fine, Doc? You'll look like a film star, Susanita. What do you see in Susanita? She's so ugly. - But she's very nice. - She's real crazy. - Watch she doesn't die like Fidel. - Don't worry, Mr. Ru. I'm just saying. So will you keep working for me? Sure, Mr. Ru. As long as you don't mind. Why would I mind, man? Didn't I show you the business? You're my right hand, right? Thank you, Mr. Ru. And you're getting nice and soft. It's about time. - What's up, Mr. Ru? - Nothing yet... but it will. - What did that cop tell you? - It's getting hot. There are a lot of claims against us. - What? - Beat it. Damn you, Güicho, get out of here! The investigation comes from the top, asshole. That ass wants more money. - How much did he ask for? - Double. Shit, we'll just have to pay him to lay off of us. Don't you think the snitch could be the fire-eater? That jerk doesn't have the balls. That fucking bitch. What, what? Fucking Zacarias, I think you know something. Don't play dumb. Long live the bride and groom! A kiss! A kiss! How about a dance, Florecita? Get away from me, or I'll spit on you, asshole. - Let's leave. - It's the cops, run for it, man! Freeze, assholes! THE RETURN FOR SALE FOR RENT Isn't that Chava? Hi, Chava! What a surprise! Where have you been hiding? Need a hand? Leave them there, pal. How's it going? - How much do I owe you? - Forty-five. What's up, Mr. Macario? How's the meat business? This is my wife and my little son. - See you later. - Sure. Chava, my son! Come, let's go with my mom. Chava... my son. I'm so happy to see you. - How are you? - Fine, son. Mom, this is Tina. And Rutilito. I'm a grandmother, Cata! The first year was tough. And then we began to make our way. I even had a job in San Diego. But the damn border patrol sent us back. I tried to cross a few times, but the gringos make it hard. So, we just hang around the border with no money. - Didn't Abel go with you? - No, Catita. We split up after a while. He took off to Houston. He disappeared. Almita disappeared too. Almita? - Really? - Yes, she did. A lot has gone on since you left. I got married. You, married, Susanita? That's great! I thought something was different. - Those aren't your teeth. - No, they're new. They look very good. Thank you. This child has to rest now. Take him to my room, Mom. Go with her, Tina. Don't be afraid. We'll live here. No, Chava. First you have to speak to your father. Why? He can't still be mad. - No more dominoes? - No way. Fidel died. Zacarias and Doc are in jail. And the poet hasn't been around here since you left. Guess what? I got married. - To whom? - To Susanita. You married Susanita! She got you young and stupid. Stupid, maybe, but now I'm your father's right-hand man. Careful! Your father. Dad. I'm back, Dad. I brought you whiskey. Your favorite kind. This was Abel's room. Remember? It's very dirty, but you can stay until you find something better. Thank you. It smells really bad, Chava. Don't give me a hard time, damn it! I'll show my dad. I can make it without his help. Get settled. I'll let you be. Excuse me. Don't screw me up! I haven't yet thanked you for treating us so well. And don't think I've forgot the money you lent me. I'll pay you every last cent as soon as I can. Forget it, Chava. You already paid me. No, Susanita. You opened love's doors to me. Thank you, Susanita. What are you doing here? I don't want you in my house. Out! Damn it! What a lack of respect! This is all I needed. - What's this racket? - Old nag! I said I didn't want to see your fucking son or his bitch here. Shut up! You'll wake the baby. Get that scum out or I'll toss it into the trash. Rutilio, how dare you be so shameful! You'll see! You have a very nasty grandfather. Look, Rutilio, his nose and forehead are just like yours. - Lies. - Yes, it's true. Rutilito. Know what they named him? Rutilio. Hold him, don't be afraid. What a beautiful boy. Chava, congratulations! You did well. - Give him to me. - What a boy you have. - Give him to me! - Leave him. - You don't want me here. - You'll hurt him. Chava, please! - I'm his grandfather, Chava. - Give it to him, Chava. Mrs. Cata? Looking for Mrs. Cata? No one's there. She'll be back tonight. Do you want to leave a message? I know you. Aren't you Alma's friend? What do you know about her? Nothing. I just came by to visit Mrs. Cata. Well... Don't you remember me? I'm Chava, Abel's friend. We met at the bar. Yes, I remember. - All right, I'm leaving. - I'll go with you. I can find my way out. I'll be right back. Take the suitcase. It can't miss. With this potion, our lady Saint Anne got pregnant. She was an old lady. Who? Our lady Saint Anne, the Holy Virgin's mother. It won't make me sick like the other one? No. It's the results that count. Drink it all down. Susanita, a serenade! It's very bitter. Mrs. Cata. I came back. Susanita, I came back. Tell Alma to come out. Oh, Abelito. - What do I tell him? - Tell him. Oh, Abelito... Alma... disappeared. This pot is great, buddy. Have some. What a bitch! How can she say she just disappeared? For a daughter, you'd even look in hell. Chill out. She looked for her. I swear, she did. Sure, I can tell. How did it go for you on the other side? Like shit. Well, at least you earned good money. Don't bust my ass! All I want is to find Alma. Don't mess with me. Where is she? Where do I look for her? Maybe she had an accident. Maybe she's dead. She's not dead. No way. What? How do you know? Wait. How do you know? - Do you remember Maru? - Who? Maru. Alma's friend, asshole. I ran into her one day. You can imagine... Don't go, Chava! What did she say? What? You won't like it, Abel. Forget that woman. Why won't I like it? Why? What do you know? She became a whore, asshole! A professional whore, man. Shit, I said you weren't going to like it. So I told Doc, the first thing we do when we get out of this filthy jail is have a round of dominoes with our buddies. Nobody inside played? Inside, there's only time to break your ass. How would Amado Nervous put it, Ubaldo? "I only found the long nights of my pain. You hadn't promised me nights of fun and game." Fun and games from now on. We're all together again. You're here now. I guess Mr. Ru forgave you. You must be getting it on with him! "I loved. I was loved. The sun caressed my face." Shit, poet, you never change. What's the matter with the barber? He's so drunk, he doesn't know his name. No, he suffers from love. Whores. Whores! My woman too, to tell you the truth. And you know with whom? With that idiot I put in jail, who's back out again. She betrayed me. When I loved her most, she betrayed me. Get Abel out. He's too drunk. Hurry up! Abel. Let's go, buddy. Come on now. Look at yourself. You knew, man, and you didn't tell me. It hurts seeing you like this. - You're a good friend. - That's enough, asshole. You know... You know, Chava. Don't be so thickheaded. I don't know anything. Even if she is a whore... I want to see her. She has to tell me face-to-face. I'll come back tomorrow when you're sober. No, don't leave, man. Help me! Take me to where she is. When you went to Tijuana, I stood up for you. I went with you because you asked me. It won't do any good to see her. You'll only feel worse. Listen, everyone. This is boring, very sad. Kika and Beba are going to do a little number dedicated to all the handsome gents here tonight. All right, action! Lucia, what will you play? Everybody, get happy! Damn, man, look at that ass. I would screw her. There you go, Colombia's finest. So, are we going to dance tonight? What are you doing here? Sit down. We can talk here. Why did you do this to me? Answer me. You left when I needed you most. So, it was easier for you to become a whore? No, it wasn't easy. I was silly, blind. But I love you so much, Abel. I've always loved you. Sure, I can see that. You don't understand. What don't I understand? What life is all about. Or, like Mom says, destiny. I worked like a mule to earn some money. To return for you. To... To marry you. You promised you'd wait. I remember very well. I was always thinking about you too. Every day. Every hour. What are you doing here? Who is this fucker, Karina? He's a friend, José Luis. A friend of yours? Well, he can't be here. Toño. Please, José Luis. Get the shit out of here! Wait, Abel! This whore belongs to me, asshole! - Please go, Abel. - I didn't hear you, shithead! Leave! Bitch, you don't have friends. You don't have anything. Nothing. You have no clothes, no earrings. You have no name, Karina, you idiot. You hear me? Look at me. You don't have friends or family. You have nothing. You only have me. José Luis. José Luis is all you have. We already talked about this. It's not the first time. You've been stealing from me since we got married. My mother required an operation. I needed money. Why didn't you ask? I thought I could pay you back from my savings. - I don't believe you, Güicho. - I swear. I don't believe you at all. You'd better leave here. Here, here it is. You're shameful. Get out! Get out! You've never understood anything! You're a pig! I'm sorry. - Leave! - Don't be so hard. Don't be so hard. Don't be so hard. What's up, man? I came for you. Maru is having a party at her house. It's late, but we may still get there in time. You need a distraction, man. Forget all that. I can't. Where are you going? Don't tell me you're going to see that bitch. Are you nuts? What's the matter with you? Forget her. Listen to me, as a friend, as a brother. Then I'm going with you. This is my affair, Chava. All mine. - No, I've never tried it. - You'll like it. Abel, no! No! No, please! I beg you! Let me have him, boss. Let me have him, boss. Chicken shit! I warned you, asshole! Nothing happened. Sit down. Nothing happened. Calm down. Take this. Nothing happened. Calm down. I'm okay, don't worry. I'll go for a cab. Don't leave. Stay a while. I'll get you to a hospital, and you'll get better. So we can get married. In your white dress... and your bridal veil. All our neighbors will see us together. And they'll see you smile at me. Yes, my love. All of them will see how much you really love me. - Yes, my love. - Everyone. - Everyone. - Everyone. Everyone.
