Breakfast sandwich in the microwave. You know, mom? One day I'm gonna own a restaurant and make bank, so you don't have to work at your crappy job. Not before I beat the casino, then I'll support your college education and you won't have to go to your crappy job. Is that clock right? Six a.m. Ooh mom. Time to get up. Oh. Oh, well I guess you're already up. Celia, some privacy please? Excuse me, I am your stepmother now. You have to call me mom. Okay, you know what, Celia? Mom. Mom. Okay, this is really awkward. Honey, there's nothing awkward about this. Sex is a very natural thing. Would you like a little lotion? What? I know what kinda lotion you need. You need the cocoa butter. Yeah, sure. You're disgusting. Oi. Get up, get up. Wake up. Time to go to work. What're you doing? Why am I wet? Damn, bro! He was a humble man who inherited millions when his father passed away. Now he's moving mountains with tacos. Bruce? Well you know before I thought I had it all, but I didn't have a community that I belonged to and well now I do. He's building a fleet of taco trucks just for love and tacos. Yeah, you know what? You know what? I mean I got somethin' to say. Before I had an addiction, you know? I was what you would call. Perlumptuous. No, it's perlumptuous. I was into ladies with really big lumps everywhere, you know? So this one time, I was at this jaina, you know? We got down, a little crazy. And then you know, she come back at me an hour later. She's talkin' about she pregnant. But I did what any real man would do, you know? I booked it and then I changed my beeper number and then that's when I found Bruce. Bruce changed my life, dawg. Great. Hey, you have a heart of gold, dawg. C'mere, c'mere. No no. No, I said never touch me, okay? Now I gave you a job, that's enough. - Thank you. - Gimme a taco, eh? - Nope. - Thank you for sharing. Sorry, fellas. Well anyway, I'm a very hands-on person. So with each new truck that I open up, I'm right there working with the workers making sure everything's tip-top. And I have a philosophy. Yes? And that is that you need to give cholos jobs, not drugs. You give them tacos, not guns. You need to give them hope, not hip-hop. Bruce took all my anger and rage and he channeled 'em to cooking. That's great. You know, he taught me skills on how to handle pressure or without hurting people. Hey, mom. These guys, they're my bathos. I love them. Wait, wait a minute. Which one of you took my wallet? Which one of you guys took my? They didn't. They didn't take my wallet. That's the kinda fun racial humor we have down here at Taco Ghando.

We will grow all over Southern California. Which means each and every one of you, especially Smokes has an opportunity to become a manager or assistant manager in a Taco Dollar establishment. Wow, first manager. Then hey, president. I don't eman to break your heart but no way in hell. Now also I found out through our many connections that we have a surprise visit from the health inspector today. How'd you find that out? I asked him. We used to work together in medical clearances in porn. Now listen people, I wanna have As. Screw the Cs. I can't see Indians selling tacos. Don't they do casinos? He's a 7/11 Indian, you idiot. Okay, no Cs. What's so wrong with Cs anyway? I averaged Cs in high school. Look at me now, I'm doin' great. You know, if we get anything that is less than an A, I will give you all pink slips.

We eliminated the church that was sellin' the tacos and we got rid of the gang that was selling the cookies. The Girl Scouts? Bunch of little girls, they screamed a lot? Yeah, that's the ones. Well anyway, they're gone. But Taco Ghando knows that in this environment to survive, you have to crush the competition and that's just what we're gonna do. And our competition is right across the street, Taco Dollar. And by the time we're done with them, their dollar will be devalued like the Mexican peso. 'Cause the peso is what you guys use for money. It's pathetic. But to get you goin', I have some incentives if we make our projections for this quarter. Incentives and bonuses work for me.

You gonna interview me when my taco shop gets really big and famous? I will interview you. Looks like Charlie's in the wire. Hi, welcome to Taco Ghando. I'm Bruce. First time here? - Yeah. - Great. Taco Ghando, what a great name. Why? Oh, well I did wanna name it Taco Gandhi. But some guy up in Berkeley already registered the name, so Taco Ghando. But I love Gandhi and I think he's one of the best guys who's ever died. Oh, you like my logo? Yeah, I have a foundation community-oriented. I'm tryin' to give at-risk youth a second chance, you know? I don't think that's a youth. I know he has three and he owes child support. Just one second, okay? Hey Spider, back to work. We have new customers here. Now the big long-term plan is to have a fleet of taco trucks throughout Southern California. Here we grow again. That's a McDonald's slogan. No, it's not. - No, it's not. - What I think... Yeah, but it doesn't matter. I said it first. I was in the bar when I said it, so I'm willing to go to court to prove it. So do you have any lingua? Yes, marinated cows on your own special sauce. Guapo Loco. You better be manning that grill, bathos. Hey, would you guys like some free t-shirts? How 'bout that?

You're a violent people, that's why I hired you. Didn't you guys come over here? Yeah, don't blame us, you know? 'Cause you couldn't handle it. No, I'm talkin' about the taco truck. Oh. - Yeah yeah yeah. - Okay. All right, get your arm off me please. Oh, did you guys have a nice little visit? Oh wow, t-shirts. Gill, they can't even park there. Why are you worried? I'm worried because food is a battle and I'm a general and a good general always worries. I played a general once. I made a camel cry. Now it looked like I was drillin' for oil the whole time. You know what I'm sayin'? Did it in one take. One. I'll never look at a camel the same way ever. Mighty Mac, Quesadilla, start scrubbin'. I wanna get an A. Call me, boss? I talked about that roach coach across the way. Oh, they can't park that thing there. No, I called the cops. They can park there. But you can't have a taco truck parked within 50 feet of a restaurant. Yeah, in our city. If they parked in another city. They found a legal loophole. - Uh-uh. - Yeah. That smells good. New recipe? No, it's our competition. Uh-uh. Mm-hmm. Try it. - Mmm. - You see what I'm sayin'? It's good. They got a secret recipe. I'm gonna have a secret recipe. We need a secret recipe. We need a secret recipe like now. What do we have here, couple of Mexican food connoisseurs or corporate spies? You had your employees spying on me. What? I really hate spies. Oh, I'm sorry. Very rude. Have you met Mad Dog Tony? His name's not Mad Dog Tony. That's Gerardo. He used to work for me. Too bad I fired him 'cause he took too many toilet paper rolls and ketchup. That guy? That's Spider. He used to be my ex-fry cook. Yeah, but I had to fire him too. You know why? Because he never washed his hands. I called him Mr. E. coli. Remember me? I remember you. You never called me back. I remember you. El Guapo Loco. So pretty it hurts. He's a male model. Never made it. I've done some runway ad print work. Yeah, for three years in prison. Okay, well now they work for me and we have a terrific location just across the street from you. So Mad Dog Tony, why don't you go ahead and just mark your territory? What? What the hell is he doing? Damn. Really somethin' else, huh? Honey, you need to drink more water. My god, it's like "Secretariat." That's for firin' me. That's a good dog, Mad Dog. So now that I have your attention, just wanna let you know that we are at war with Taco Dollar and the war will end when we close you down. Back to base, cholos. What the hell? Where's the backup? 'Bout to clean this place! Calm down, remember your pressure. God. Smokes, grow some balls please. Sorry, Gill. Stop eatin' my food. He pissed on my foot. This is war and they fired the first shot. Now Mad Dog Tony has the power right there in his hands. What the hell is that? I stole it from a military lab. I used to be a custodian. I call it Ebola. Chemical warfare, my amigos. Go ahead, release it. And it's still funny. Hey, Old School. What's happenin'? When a girl's married, which finger is the ring finger? Well traditionally the wedding band is worn on the left hand. The vena amoris was said to be directly connected to the heart, a symbol of love on the left side of the body. Left hand. Learn all that in prison? I read an encyclopedia back to front, front to back, back to front and I learned to make a great Merlot outta raisins and a toilet bowl. Thanks, Old School. Anytime, homie. 'Sup, Oscar? Whoa, what happened to you? My brother hit me. Hey, Mighty Mac. Yo, what's up, Smokes? C'mere. Damn, Oscar. Dude, who got a hold of you, Chris Brown? Did you hit him? Yeah, but it was an accident.

Well just for a little lunch, I bought this really delicious dish. It's called a Cemita and it's bomb. Eat, rest. The dinner crowd is gonna kick your ass. You gotta eat something. Okay, let's see what you can cook up. So what's up with the guy who mumbles all the time? What's his deal? Mugres, he used to be a luchador. What? Mexican wrestler. His name was Omar Goverde. If he had the suit on and the mask, you'd probably recognize him. So did he get messed up in the ring? No, motorcycle accident. No helmet. Oh. A lotta people like make up reasons as to how he got messed up. Some claim it was drugs. That's even more messed up. Not really. I mean they pay him to come speak at high schools. A drug counselor comes and tells the kids how drugs messed up Mugres. And then he speaks and it scares the hell outta the kids. It's really funny. So is that his girlfriend? Oh, Amber? No, I don't know. Mmm, oh my god. That's a good torta. Oh, it's not a torta. It's called a Cemita. So good. It's from Mojacar. That's where my grandma was both. You really like my Cemita?

Yeah? Oh no, it's the investors. Is this love that I'm feeling? Just feel it. - Is this love? - Ooh. You like it. Sorry, the investors are here. - Ooh, already? - Yeah. Osvaldo, I'll be right back. Okay. What the hell? Son? Oh, you guys already know each other. What? Did you just call Smokes son? Hold that thought. What's up, man? So we hangin' out? No, I'm not gay. The hell? You think I'm gay? You're the queer, you want me. Besides, what's wrong with you wanting me? You're the one that wants to hook up. Relax Sox, okay? I think I'm havin'... You're the one hitting up on me. You're like bi-cholo curious, I can tell. Bi-cholo what? Tank tops turn you on, eh? Mr. Singh. Malcolm X. Ladies, sit. Sweetie, that's Arabic. I'm Indian. It's like getting a Mexican and a Cuban mixed up. Somebody is bound to get offended. I am so sorry. I didn't mean to offend. Look, I Indian and I did enjoy the movie "Dances with Wolves." So I just wanted to let you know, I'm Sue. Got Indian in my family, see? I got good hair. Where do I begin? First of all, lemme guess store-bought. Well it's from India. I have an eye for hair. I think that that is Filipino. You got gypped. Shut up. Rogelio. Don't call me that. Calm down, son. Would you quit with this son crap? Don't call me that! Hey, show a little respect to your father, okay? These are my wives and associates. Okay, let's just start over. I'm sorry. I'm Eve, the manager and I welcome you all to our profitable taco establishment. They don't talk to strangers. You think you're somethin', son? Think you're a gangster rat? You're messin' with the wrong cheese. Where's Gill? Oh, well he's talking to the health inspector right now. Oh, there's a health inspector here. Nothing to worry about. No need at all. Just a routine health inspection. This rat's messin' with my head, man. You want some of this? As a matter of fact. Die, die! In fact, there's a matter of... We're so healthy around here. Zagat gave us a prize. I'm quite familiar with Zagat, but I didn't know that they were giving away prizes. You didn't know Zagat gave? You of all people didn't know Zagat gave prizes. - They don't. - It's about the zig-Zagat prize. Susie! Could you please bring this gentleman and his lovely wives some of our award-winnin' tacos? You walk out on my mom and now you're tryin' to date my boss like you're some kinda catch? You know what? I think I'm gonna go. You're good at that. You know, I think you owe me a little respect. Oh man, dude. Are you okay? Dude, he infected me, man. Probably have like rabies or bubonic plague, scabies, man. HPV. Listen to yourself, man okay? The HPV, that's the human papillomavirus. It's an STD. You mean I have to wear a condom for the rest of my life when I have sex, man? I'm gonna kill that rat, dude. No, relax! He infected and humiliated me, Mac. Just like my last girlfriend. It's okay, buddy. Come here. It's okay. We'll get him. We'll get him. It's okay, it's okay. I'm here. Thank you, Eve. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you. All right, bye bye now. - Hi. - How are you? Good, how are you? Oh, a polite one. That's a change. What do you know about respect? I might be your father, but I'm not afraid of kickin' your ass. Bring it on! You Americans are so funny. But are you really American? Where are you from? Do you wanna get married? No. How are your hips? Good, good. Not too wide. Good. You know what? You definitely needed a father figure, you spoiled punk. Have a seat. Come back anytime. Shut up. Eat. I hate you! Stop, Smokes! What the? - Smokes. - Whoa whoa whoa. Now I'm happy. Your mother walked out on me. What, why? Look, I loved your mother, all right? She's not perfect. She has a gambling problem. That's why she left me. Just get the hell out of here. You know nothing about her. Excuse me, Eve. This doesn't affect us, does it? You lowlife wannabe! - It's not my fault! - No no no. Break it up! Stop it! Calm the hell down! The hell is goin' on? Fightin' with customers? Are they complainin' about my cooking? I'll explain later. Please don't fire my son. Your son? He's your dad? Yeah, he walked out on me. I tried to contact your mother again. I tried to make things right. I hope one day you can find the truth, hope you can forgive me. Oh yeah and this is for the cheap shot. Hope you can forgive me for that too. Osvaldo. Where's she goin'? Eve's been dating Smokes' dad. They've kinda been dating online. We've been sexting. We've never actually done it. We send each other buttnaked pictures, that's all. Gill, I'm sorry I lost it, man. You can't fire me. My mom. Calm down, I'm not gonna fire you. Gill. You okay? Just my ulcer. C'mon, I got medicine. C'mon, c'mon. All right, all right. Ow. Are you okay? You need to lay off them tortillas. Damn. What happened to you? They wouldn't let us sell our DVDs at that raggedy lunch truck. What, so they beat Mugres up? And they took our merchandise. Wanna get back at those a-holes? Hell yeah. Let's open up a can of whoop ass. You two an item? What? Oh, you guys are homo homies. It's cool. I'll leave. I'm not a homewrecker. Actually as a matter of fact, yes. Q and I are homo homies, right Q? - Yeah. - Yeah. I'm sorry, Sox. I didn't mean to give you the wrong idea. It's cool. I'll leave then. All right, buddy. But first, kiss. I'm sorry, what? You heard me, foo! - But. - But nothin'. Kiss her, man. I'ma jump over this counter and beat both of y'all down. You're gonna kiss or I'll tear you guys apart. Like a kiss on the cheek? Am I the guy or the girl? If you two go out, I wanna see proof. Kiss. Are you bein' for real right now? Yeah, come on, man. We don't want trouble. All right, I'm the guy. Whatever, dude. Yeah. What in the hell's goin' on? Shh. They're kissing. I should've never let them work the night shift together. Don't look. No no no. Those two need a room. I'm not against their lifestyle. I went to British boarding school after all. But I wanted a family-style restaurant. Mr. Singh, we just need one day to regroup. Oh Gill, you need more than regrouping. Yes. Yes, sir. Kiss him again with some lingua. Tongue? You know he like it. ♪ Whoa ♪ Oh, you missed a button. No, made you look. Kidding. It's a little joke. It's Indian humor Go. Can I get you three of our world-famous wet tacos? Why not? Quesadilla, three wet tacos! ♪ Here comes happiness ♪ What's a wet taco? Taco wet would be, you know? What? Well the taco resembles in many respects. ♪ Here comes happiness ♪ Is it safe for children? No, no. Well children come from there. There, foo. That didn't hurt. I knew you weren't gay. You shoulda just told me. ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ There goes loneliness ♪ - Not a word. - Shh. Ah, I remember London. All right, let's see. We got workers viciously injured by a rat, that's not good. Brie not thrown in the trash. Two men kissing at the counter, not good but not illegal. That cholo's wearin' a hairnet. That's good, but he does not work here. Is that all? It's very serious. I could shut you down. Will you? No, I'm gonna give you one more chance, Gill. One last shot, all right? Now I'm gonna leave you here, go to a nice clean restaurant, have lunch in a place that not gonna gimme botulism and then I will return. And when I do return, if I find that this place is 1/2 as bad as it is right now, then I will have to shut you down. Tellin' you, this has gotta be the unsafest restaurant that I have ever visited. No wonder this place is so friggin' empty. Gill, are you okay? No, nothing's okay. That damn taco truck's takin' my customers. It's empty. Operation: This is pussy. The hell is that? I got it at a Siamese cat fighting ring. Really? Yeah, it's not as popular as dog fights in Bangkok, but it's growing. Watch your fingers. Nice. Dog Bite. Go get 'em, Dog Bite. - Oh oh. - Yeah yeah. That is a fight! That did it, man. That thing is nasty! See? It's a head of a cat looks like that, eww. He's wearin' it like a mask! He's wearin' it. It's like Hannibal Lecter. Hey, somethin' smells weird. Spider, go check around and make sure nobody's smoking the Mota. Guys don't know what it's like to be in charge of a big business like that. You gotta stay on top all the time. Damn rats! We're gonna need a bigger cat. Recycle that, homie. What the hell? Did Osvaldo do that to you? No. No, it was a rave from the grease wagon. Oh, it's like that. Okay here, look. Stop the swelling. Man up. Thank you. Just wish it wasn't punch-Smokes-in-the-face day. Aww sweetie, I'm sorry. If you don't mind me asking, when was the last time you actually saw him? Who, my supposed dad? I think at a little league game when I was nine. He was hiding in the bleachers, but I knew he was there. Hiding? Fair. What? Looks like Thug Life went Tupac. Oh my god, I spent a lotta money on that cat. I bought it from Michael VicK's cousin and that's half pitbull. I. Gill, you okay? No. Do I look okay, you idiot? I'll get a doctor. I'll get a doctor. It's on, it's on. I'm too young to die. I got so much to live for. I got my own fuck it list. No, Gill. You're not gonna die, 'kay? I'll call 9-1-1. Smokes, promise me you won't screw things up. What? I don't screw things up. Smokes, look after our new investors. So stressed out. - God. - Yeah, Gill. I promise. Don't gimme mouth-to-mouth resuscitation or try to revive me. I have an open sore. You have an open sore in your mouth? No, not in my mouth. So you could even give me mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. That's okay. C'mon. I've never. I don't know, help. Someone. Someone save my life now. Come on. Watch it, I'll die. Okay. - Don't screw it up. - This is wrong. Where's the ambulance? It's this damn hood. This damn hood! Probably drive myself to the hospital. Smokes? Smokes. I'm right here. Thanks for giving me the mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. You got soft lips. So. You think Gill will be okay? Yeah, I hope so. You actually got into a fight and didn't get fired? Yeah, it was with my dad. Luckily, Gill had a bad relationship with his dad too. Right. Did you fight in front of Susie? Yeah, why? Well it's either gonna make you look like a real tough guy or a dysfunctional lowlife with deep-seeded issues. Cheers. What're you doin' this weekend? Looking for a second job. I have to pay for school. Thought you'd be with your boyfriend or somethin'. I don't have a boyfriend. Cool. Not cool that you don't have a boyfriend because you should. You need a manly... You deserve a boyfriend because you're so pretty. I'm just gonna go back here. All right. Sorry 'bout your father. I swear I didn't know, but I broke it off with him anyway. Why, because he's a dick? No because you're my boy. Your dad's not a dick. He's actually a nice guy and he says he loves you. He said that? Man, of course. He's a good guy. And between me and you, I think he deserved what he got. So you gonna see him again? Nah. When it comes to love, I'm like the Clippers: a born loser. Well the Clippers don't lose all the time. Yeah? Well they never won the championship and I say the championship is marriage. Smokes, it's like my life is just passin' me by. I don't wanna be a Clipper. I don't wanna be a Clipper all the time. Well who does? I'd rather be a Laker, but they can lose too. What are you making? Some poop juice. Are you aware that your dad is the first man I have ever dated in my entire life that didn't have a criminal record? Do you even get it? Yeah, well just poop on that. Why do I always screw up? I don't get it. A bunny. We heard about Gill. We didn't want this to get out of hand. But Gill represents the old way, the old mom and pop shops. He's regular mail versus email. He's DVDs versus downloads. He's 8-tracks versus MP3s. What's 8-track? Think my primo's from 8-track. Shh. I think we might have a problem here. What if there is, ese? What are you gonna do about it? Nothing? I was just posing a hypothetical question. Don't waste our time with hypotheticals. Okay. Because I'm the real deal, okay? I am the new way. I'm corporate. I'm not pathetic. But we're gonna give you a break, okay? A truce, just 'til Gill gets back. We don't need a break. Yeah, we had a break like 23 minutes ago. Besides you know, this is gonna beat your tacos any day. This is our new secret recipe, just try it. We'll see 'bout that. Not bad. What's in it? Special marinated beef. Is that whole whack of mole? So chocolate taste. Hint of pine nuts in there maybe. You know, mole's been around since the Aztec days. That's why they lost the war. But you, you could be a leader. You got executive written all over you. Now I know you're loyal to Gill, but things change. I mean you never know what's gonna happen. Maybe there's a grease fire, Gill's not here. That could be bad and I know you know about fires, Smokes. Right back there, big stack of newspapers. Propane tank, boom! "Mommy, I'm burning." Not my problem. You know what, your taco? Nothin' special. Guackenmole went out last year. Read the trades. Okay, a quick question about them. Is there cheese in the taco? 'Cause I'm lactose intolerant. There is? Okay, well. Ow. Okay, here I go. I can make it. I can't make it. I'm not gonna make it. Oh god. Hey boss, you all right? No, I don't know what was in that taco, but I got it comin' out both ends. Careful, my appendix might be in there. You messed with the wrong gringo. Bring the bucket back. So what're you doin' after work? I'm leavin' early today. I gonna visit my mama's grave. Yeah, she died on this very day five years ago. I was a prick when she died. Sorry, man. You goin' alone? I'm the only one left, pal. Don't you have a girlfriend? There's not a lotta women who wanna go out with an ex-convict workin' the grill. That's not true. You're a great guy. You served your time. Actually, I got out early 'cause the state was broke. You were innocent, right? No, I was guilty as hell. I just hope nobody ever runs my DNA. Okay, so, then you load the roll and then press. You press this button. Correct, yeah. Sorry it's not rocket science, Miss 4.0. No, it's not. That's the register. Perfect. Can I have a word with you? 'Course. Be right back. All right so my mother raised me alone, but she never gave up on herself dating. She dated lots of good guys and some married ones, but don't give up on love. ♪ In my heart ♪ Thank you for that, Smokes. Hey, Taco Dollar. We're here to kill. What are you, the ghetto ghostbusters? No, ratbusters and we have a killer strategy. Say hello to my little friend. Hello. Mm-hmm, hola. What? We're gonna smoke that motha out. Hey, Q man. I didn't roll that thing for just a rat, okay? Why don't you pass it over here? A little more. Yeah. So as I was sayin', I got a friend who runs a dirty diaper cleanin' service, so we took a turn in dirty diapers and put it under that lunch truck. Nice. And then we blew all four tires on that psycho white boy's roach coach and now it's a doo-doo mobile. You're kidding me. It was probably those guys from Taco Ghando who gave you guys that plague. What're you talkin' about? I saw those cholos in the back of the store with a shoebox, a big Shaq-foot rat-size shoebox. Q, did you just hear that? I knew it was those guys. Taco Ghando. Hey Eddie, what's up? Hey baby. Ooh, I am so sorry about your mom. I'm not cryin' over mom. I'm cryin' over onions. Sure. Mmm. Kickin'. That's good right there, Mugres. Man. This guy ODed I can't believe it. Hey, Q. Hey. Leave me alone, abuela. I'm not touching myself. Hey man, I'm paranoid and all hungry. Dude, he's done. Look it, look it. That rat's got my cheese, man. He's got munchies too, dude. Come on, just let me give you a ride home after work. Okay, I will take you up on that offer. Any news on Gill? Oh yes, I talked to his doctor. Just needs to rest and be stress-free. Stress-free. He better stay away from here. He suffered a minor cardiac infarction. A mini fart? A mini heart attack. Listen, guys. I gotta go crunch some numbers and then give Gill a call and tell him everything is running smoothly. You're kickin' ass in here, Old School. Shit. Thank you. The health inspector is here. Old School, keep him entertained. Mac, Q, catch that damn rat. Number 34, your order's ready. C'mon, let's go. Mommy, did he say rat? Bacteria in lemon slices. Yes. - Your dirty ice. - Mm-hmm. That foodborne bacteria. That's your biggest challenge. Man, you are so right and it's very difficult to detect. You know, you should be doin' my job. You know a lot about bacteria and E. coli. And the neurovirus. That is one contagious beast. You've got that right. Hey, guys. Is Gill here? No. All right, well he does not need to be here. I'm gonna go ahead and start right here in the kitchen. Anything I can assist with? Tell you what, you can call my boss. There's a job waitin' for you. That is great. I'm a convicted felon. That is a great opportunity for me. Thank you. You don't say. - Yeah. - Gimme that. All right. Die, rat! How's the kitchen looking, Mr. Holmes? Were those gunshots? No. No no, I'm sure it's just the door jamming. You need to check that door. Yeah, excuse me. Q, what the hell? It's that rat, man. He's in my head, man. He's messin' with my mind, dude. And he's in my head. He's messin' with my mind, dude. Told you I see him everywhere, man. He winked at me. You're supposed to be watching him. He's in my head and everything. He's messin' with my mind, dude. Q, gimme the gun. It's that rat, man. Q, gimme the gun. In my head. You're supposed to be watching him. Where did you even get this? It's that rat, man. You know, you people love our drama. Whoa, okay. Everybody just relax, all right? Everything's under control. Okay, now it all makes sene. The health inspector is in cahoots with Taco Dollar? Shameful. No, sir. I shut you down because I found diapers and other toxicities under your mobile taco shop. Okay, well I'll have you know that I was set up. By whom? By them. Excuse you? Taco Ghando is full of shit! Yeah! That's right. Okay. Little guy, you just started a battle that you can't win. So what's gonna happen? World War Tres, boop. Cracker, please. Hey. Not you, sir. Not you. I'm talkin' to the cracker with the bald head. Hey, I'll fight. I know the art of Kama Sutra. I can screw a woman so good that she'll fight for me, eh? I need goddesses like that. Oh, hell no. You ain't all that. I'm not fighting. - Let's go. - Hurry up! Yeah. Payback means comeback for El Moco Verde. Moco Verde? Yeah, he was big in. Amber, Susie, Eve, can you go outside please? Hell no. - No. - No! Honey, I'm not goin' nowhere. Forget that. I'm throwin' down with these mighty maricon asses. And I can hold my own. Damn, impressive. I have balls and so should you. Well I have balls. Really? 'Cause you've been tryin' to ask me out all day. Well if I make it out alive, do you wanna go out sometime? Even though I don't cook, I'm independent and lookin' to be educated? Especially because of that. ♪ Yes, you know ♪ Say hello to my big friends. Gill, what the hell? I knew it'd come to this, so I brought two of my buddies from the biz. But they're women. Not quite yet. They're just one little procedure away from it. Bill, Tony, let's kick some ass. Okay, are you the captain of this ship? Dude, we didn't wanna start anything with you. Okay look, I can either end my competition one way or another. Son, is this still a bad time? Can someone please get my mother outta here? I'm here for you, ese. Thank you. I just need to prove to you that I'm here for more than sex. Wow, okay. There's people here. Not in my puedes. No, no puedes. Shh. Si, se puedes. Don't judge. What's going on? They're tryin' to fight your son and close my establishment. These putos want to rumble? I fight crazy. They used to call the sad girl back in the day. Gill, you have a bad heart. You can't fight. I'm okay. It was just a reaction to Viagra. It's very common. If it doesn't go down in four hours, call a doctor. Let's go. El ca-vay-oh. Okay, beaner. What'd you say? I said let's go ahead and settle this, beaner. No no no no. I hate you. It's a race riot. Oh, man. Protect my glasses. Ooh, ow. You gon' call me back next time? Gon' call me back? No. I said no! Mine, private! Did you guys see that? El Moco Verde is back. Maybe it's time for you to train again. I'ma call Don King. Well maybe, just maybe. Oh my god, Gill. You can't walk? No no, I'm just tired and hung over. I was partying in Vegas. Porn convention. Twins my back out. Well no tacos, no investors. We're done. Gill. Look who the rat dragged back in. No, look. Look, I wanna call a truce. Well it's a little late for that now. We're both closed down, all right? We're just fighting over our little bits of turf like a couple of gangs, but their gangs are fighting over food. But similar to gangs, we're fighting. I one time fought over some pork chops. Sorry. My point is nobody won. What do you guys do? Just never goes on. Mijo. I won. I won, I won. Oh hell yeah, I knew it. I lost for so many years and finally I won the biggest poker tournament in Carson. What's this? Your money. This is 10 times more than what I gave you. I have a little tiny gambling problem. But what about your job? I haven't had a job in 10 years. I'm a professional gambler and I made it big thanks to your investment. And now I'm investing in you, mijo. But you told me that you quit gambling. I lied. You need to loosen up. Open up the taco shop you always dreamed of, Smokey. I have an idea. Gill, if we combine our resources, change the men who deliver, we could make a killing. Sellin' tacos? No. Selling more than tacos. Hold up, so you guys are back in business? Yeah! Yeah. Okay then, I'm gonna crush you like so many dirty cucarachas. Wow, okay? The truce is off. Your mama. Your mother as well. From the desert to the sea, The most powerful name in local news. Rogelio Osorio known in his barrio as Smokes is a smart young entrepreneur who knew that there was more to life than selling tacos. Everybody sells tacos. We wanted something special. And the owner of taco shop, Gill Travalio Ramirez, was thinking the same thing. We needed somethin' special. And talkin' about special, you're special. I'd love to work with you.
