Hello New York! I'm Bobby Rydell. And I'm glad to be here. Thank you all for coming to see us tonight. It's Saturday night in the Copa! We think that we're gonna have a great time tonight. We're gonna do our best to make sure of that. As always a very special thanks to Mr. Jules Podell for having us out. Let's get started. Hello sweetheart. Here is my coat. And you see this here hat? I want you to guard it with your life. - It was a gift from my mother. - Yes, Mr. Loscudo. Yeah. That's for you. Thank you sir. Joey! - Hey Carmine! How are you pal? - Good to see you. Oh thank you! That's unnecessary. Come on! Let's go. On the album. I saw this kid Bobby Rydell two and a half years ago in South Philly. Nobody knew who he was. They know now. Hey! Gimme Loscudo's hat. - But he said to guard it... - I know, I heard. Give it to me. A'right? Tony Lip! You put your hands on me, you punk? Do yourself a favor. Go home with your friends. You don't tell me where to go! Do you know who I am?! I'm goin' back in there! You tell Jules Lipobdell. If I don't get my hat I'm gonna burn this joint down. I swear to God it's gonna turn up. Really? You tell that fat Jew bastard I don't get my hat I'll burn Copa down! I'm gonna have to go back to driving garbage trucks. Jesus Christ! Screw those! He's out of his mind. We earned our money tonight. Lip, I thought you were gonna kill that guy. Yeah! Better him than me. So... What are you gonna do while we're closed? I don't know. Maybe go work at my Uncle's pizza joint. - You? - I'm gonna drink for 2 months. Take me home, Lip. See you Carmine. - No! You shouldn't. That shouldn't happen. - I don't wanna be a... My hat! Heard it was missing, so I looked into it. - I wanted to kill that broad. - No. No. Wasn't her fault. Who had the balls to clip Joey's hat? - Don't worry about it, I took care of him. - Yeah! I hope you gave him some beating. Here. Take this. Put it in your kick. No. No thanks. It was a pleasure, Mr. Loscudo. Bullshit! Take it. And from now on, you don't call me Mr Loscude, ya hear me? I'm your pal Joey. Good morning. Good night! - Come on, Roger! Hit one out! - Johnny quite! You're gonna jinx it. Hey Johnny, think you can yell a little louder? - Maris is up. - Yeah, so am I now. What the hell are you guys doing here? We came over to give Dolores company. Come on! Come on Roger! Please! - I'll walk you out. - Sure. When did you get back to these board games? Come on! Thank you so much! We got it! We got it! Yeah! Do it again. Let's do it again. Come on baby! No! Tony, go get dressed. We're gonna eat. Alright! No game seven. No game seven. From thy bounty through Christ our Lord, Amen. And if anyone hears of a job for Tony, let us know. - Dolor! Please. - What? - What happened? Did you get fired? - No. No, The Copa's closing for repairs. So he just needs something for a couple months. All the people he knows, he'll find something in no time. Oh. He had a great job at the sanitation department. You shouldn't have punched out the foreman. He shouldn't have woke me up. That's Tony. I'm tellin' you, this is gonna be the easiest fifty - bucks you ever gonna made. - Yeah we'll see. Hey! There they are. Hi Johnny. - Tony! - Hey Paulie. How you doing? I'm good. I'm good. So, Johnny here tells me you ate forty-eight White Castle burgers all in one sitting. Cheese burgers. - You tell them Frankie. - I don't believe you. What do I care if you believe me? Hey Gorman. - What's the record here for Hotdogs? - Eighteen. Fat Paulie. - Why wasn't Lip in on that contest? - What contest? I was hungry. Bet's simple. Half a C-note. - Most hotdogs in an hour wins. - With toppings. What the hell you weigh? - Two sixty. - Aaaaay. Your left ass weighs two sixty. May my mother-in-law drop dead on the spot if I'm lyin'. - Alright. You're up. - Good. Pick it up Lip! The baby elephant just hit nineteen! Let's go Lip! Let's go. Come on. You are embarrassing. You're embarrassing your son. He's killing you. - Hey Nicky. You do your homework? - Yep. Good. - Where have you been? - Gorman's. I'm making dinner! Fat Paulie bet me fifty bucks he could eat more hot dogs than me. He knocked off twenty four. Guy's an animal. Are you crazy? You lost fifty dollars? Dolores. Please. I ate twenty six. You're so lucky. You know that? Rent is due on Monday. You're gonna get that? Yeah? Hey Lip. Some guy called over here, a doctor. He's looking for a driver. - You interested? - Yeah. They're interviewing guys tomorrow afternoon. The address is... Eight eighty one, 7th avenue, two fifteen. Hey! - Excuse me. - We're not open right now. But you're welcome to buy tickets to tonight's performance. Nah. That's not it. I think I got the wrong address. But is there a doctor's office in here? A doctor's office? - Dr Shirley. You have the correct address. Dr Shirley lives upstairs, above the hall. How you doing? I'm here for the driver job. Tony Lip. No Tony Lip. No it should be on there. No... Um... - I have a Tony Val... Valle... - Vallelonga. Yeah, that's me. - Fill it out while you wait. - What? Fill it out while you wait. Have a seat. Mr. Vallelonga, sorry to keep you waiting. I'm Dr. Donald Shirley. - Tony. - Yes. Please sit down. Some place you got in here. Them horns real? Elephant tusks. Yes. What about that? That a molar? - A what? - A molar. Like a Shark tooth? Tiger's maybe. It was a gift. I thought, I thought I was going to a office. They said a doctor needed a driver. That's all they told you? - Yeah. - Actually, it's a bit more complicated than that. Have you ever driven professionally before? Sanitation. Garbage trucks. Plus I drive my boss home at night. But I can drive anything. Limos, tow trucks. Snow palms, whatever. I see. What other experience do you have? I worked a lot of joints. The Wagon Wheel, Peppermint Lounge, Copa - In what capacity? - What do you mean? - What did you do there? - Ah... Public relations. Well, first of all, Tony, I'm not a medical doctor. I'm a musician. - You mean like songs? - Yes. I'm about to embark on a concert tour, the majority of which will be down South. - Atlantic city? - No. The deep south. First we're starting in the Midwest, but then we're taking a hard left. Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, and on down through the Delta. Do you foresee any issues in working for a black man? No! No no. Just the other day me and the wife had a couple of colored guys over at the house. For drinks. Hmm. I see, you're married. Yeah. Two kids. I am not sure this is the proper job for a married man. Why, we bringing broads? My point is, you'll be gone for eight straight weeks, no breaks, right up until Christmas. You're quite sure you can leave your family for that long? Depends on what you're paying. A hundred dollars a week, plus room and board. But let me be crystal clear... I'm not just hiring a chauffeur. I need someone who can handle my itinerary. Be a personal assistant. I need a valet. I need someone who can launder my clothes, shine my shoes... Good luck, Doc. Tony. I had my record label ask around town to find me the right man. Your name came up more than once. You've impressed several people with your... innate ability to handle trouble. And that is why I called and inquired about your availability. OK, here is the deal. I got no problem being on a road with you. But I ain't no butler. I ain't ironing no shirts, and I'm not polishing nobody's shoes. You need someone to get you from point A to point B? You need someone to make sure there's no problems along the way... And believe me you in the deep South there's gonna be problems. So if you want me, it's a buck and a quarter a week. Or go hire the little Chink that just pranced out of here, see how far you get. Well, Mr. Vallelonga. Thank you for stopping by. Hey Bobby. Give me a Rheingold. Ice cold. Mr Tony. Augie asking about you. - Come on, I'm dying of thirst over here! - Shut up. I'm talking. - When? - Now. He in his box. Tony Lip. What the hell happened at the Copa? I heard you split a guy's face open. That guy you hit. Mickey Charon. Charlie the Hand's crew. Guess he shoulda known better. Hand asked me to look into it. I spoke to Podell. Whole thing was a... over a piece of ass, right? Yeah. Beef like that should never happen inside the club. They were out of line. So we squashed it. You looking to earn a little extra scharole? I can keep you busy while the Copa's down. What I gotta do? Things... Appreciate it, but I'm gonna spend some time with the family. Don't be stupid. You make yourself a few extra bucks, buy something nice for that pretty little your wife of yours. Nah, I'm good. I'm flushed right now. Here's fifty. Pay me sixty by New Year, you get it back. Hey Lip. Everything OK? What? You got beak trouble Charlie? Mind your business. So come on. Dying to hear what happened with the doctor interview? He ain't a real doctor, he's a piano player. But I don't understand, why'd they say that he was a doctor? I don't know. I think he's like a doctor of piano-playing or something. You can be that? I guess. He lives on top of Carnegie Hall. You shoulda seen this place, Dee. It was filled with statues and all kinds of fancy crap. And he was sitting on top of a friggin' throne all dressed up like the king of the jungle bunnies. He's colored? - Then you wouldn't last a week with him. - For right money, I would. Yeah. Oh. Look. Uh... Really? OK. OK. Hold on a sec. It's Dr Shirley. The Piano guy, he wants to talk to you. - Me? - Yeah. What? No! Come here. Take it. Just talk. Hello. Good morning, Doctor, it's nice to talk to you. Yes, that is a long time... It is. Yes. I'm sure. Thank you for calling... Bye now. What did he say? He wanted to know if I'd be okay with him taking my husband away from his family for two months. He said he'd pay you what you asked for. - Hey! - Uh huh? It's good money. We need it. I can't be eatin' twenty six hot dogs every day. I know. I told him it was okay for you to go. Alright. Hey look. Here's the first half of your pay. You're gonna get the rest when the tour's over. - I gotta get paid every week. - Sorry, that's not how the record company does it. We gotta have some guarantee you're gonna finish the job. Why wouldn't I finish the job? I took it, didn't I? Well, then we got nothing to worry about. Here's the deal, Mr. Vallelonga. OK! It's your job to get Don to all his tour dates on time. Now if he misses any shows, - you're not getting your back-end. - He's not gonna miss any show. Good. Oh, you're gonna need this. Now this is the book I was telling you about. Sometimes you guys are staying in the same hotel, sometimes you're not. - Oh yeah, I do... - Yeah, don't let me down. Let's go. - Is this the new one? - Yeah. The record company rented it. - Nice huh. - Beautiful. So what my sister have to say about you being gone for three weeks? Eight weeks. Ten-to-one, you slap this moolie out, you come home in under a month. - Hi boys. - Say goodbye to your father. Frankie, Nicky, come here. - Hi, will you be good boys? - Uh huh. - Listen to your mother? - Uh huh. Alright, give me a kiss. I'm counting on you on this. - Don't go too far. - We won't. - Did you go to the A-A-A for the maps? - Yes, no. I mean the record company gave me maps and the itinerary and this thing. The Negro Motorist Green-Book? Yeah it lists all places coloreds can stay down south. Like, you know, traveling while black. Traveling while black? Yeah. If you're black and you gotta travel for some reason. They had a special book for that? I guess. Did you pack the iron? - I ain't lugging no iron, Dee. - How're you gonna press your pants? I'll put 'em under the mattress. I want you to write me a letter - every chance you get. - I can't write letters. - Yes, you can. - I can't write. - Take you five minutes. Promise me. - It's embarrassing. They ain't gonna be no good. It's a lot cheaper than calling long distance, Tony. Promise me you're gonna write. I promise. Here... Put this in the bank today. It's half my pay. Oh, here is a couple of sandwiches for you and Dr. Shirley. Thanks. - Be careful. - I will. - I love you. - I love you too, baby. You better be home for Christmas or don't come home at all! I got it pop. I got it. Hey! I'm Tony. The driver. Bum a smoke? Thanks. So, you're with the band? Oleg. Cello. George. Bass. And we're not a band, we're a trio. Oh, a trio? Right. - Good morning. - Good morning. Thank you, Amit. Have a wonderful trip, Sir. Tony, the first thing I'd like you to do, when we arrive in the city, is check the piano where I'm playing, make sure it's a Steinway as per my contract. And can you see to it that there is a bottle of Cutty Sark in my room every night. Every night? Well if you ever need any help with that... I won't. Ten-and-two on the wheel, please. Hey Doc. I noticed on the itinerary thing, last show's on the 23rd December. - Right? - Birmingham, yes. It's a Christmas show. So, any way we could maybe hit the road early next morning so we could be home in time for Christmas Eve? We'll see. Appreciate it. Could you put out the cigarette please? Why? I can't breath back here. What are you talking about? Smoke's going into my lungs. I'm doing all the work here. Thank you. What are you looking at? - You speak German, huh? - That was Russian. Yeah, I was stationed in Germany in the army. I can pick up a little bit of what you're saying there. Watch out for them Krauts. They're all snakes. Kennedy shoulda bombed 'em when he had the chance. Plus now them Cuban bastards. Ain't they supposed to be following us? They have the itinerary. As long as they get to the show on time, I am not worried about it and neither should you. I ain't worried about nothing. Fact, when you see me worried, you'll know. - You'll know if I'm worried. - Tony. How about some quite time? Sure. It's amazing you said that. How about some quite time? Dolores, my wife, she used to say that all time, well not all the time, but you know... She says it when I come off from work some time, you know, she's been with the kids all that day. And she would say, Tony... How about some quite time? Exactly like how you said it. It means... amazing. How was that? Salty. Have you ever considered becoming a food critic? No... Not really. Why? Is there money in it? I'm just saying, you have a marvelous way with words when describing food. SALTY! So vivid. One can almost taste it. I'm saying it's salty. And salt's cheating. Any cook can make things salty. But to make it taste good without the salt, with just the other flavors that's the trick. We should really get going soon if we expect to get to Pittsburgh by dinner. When I was in the army I knew a guy from Pittsburgh except he called it Tits-burgh he said all the women there have huge tits. That's absurd. Why would women in Pittsburgh have larger breasts than, say, women in New York? Guess we'll find out, huh? You know, when you first hired me my wife went out bought one of your records, one about the orphans. Orphans? Yeah. Cover had a bunch of kids sitting around a campfire? Orpheus. Yeah. Orpheus in the Underworld. It's based on a French Opera. And those weren't children on the cover. Those were demon in the bowels of hell. No shit. Must have been naughty kids. - What are you doing? - I gotta take a leak. Doc. - Here? Now? - You want me to piss my pants? Oh hey Doc, good afternoon. Take this for any incidentals we may need. If you want to buy something, you don't have to ask, just keep the receipt please. When it runs low let me know. Oh, thanks. One more thing. We will be attending many events before and after the concerts interacting with some of the wealthiest and most highly-educated people in the country. It is my feeling that your diction however charming it may be in the tri-state area, could use some finessing. You mean diction, like in what way? Like in the only way the word is ever used. Okay. Your intonation, inflection, your choice of words. I got my own problems, now I gotta worry about what people think about the way I talk? There are simple techniques I can teach you that are quite effective. I can help you. I don't need no goddamn help. People don't like the way I talk, they can go take a shit. - The profanity is another issue. - A fanabla, why you breaking my balls? Because you can do better. Mr Vallelonga. Which brings me to one more point as the guest of honor, I will be introduced when entering these intimate events. You will be introduced as well. In my humble opinion Vallelonga may be difficult to pronounce. So, I was thinking... Valle would be more appropriate. Tony Valle. Short and sweet. Nah! If they got a problem with Vallelonga, they can call me Tony Lip. These are genteel people. Tony Lip might be a little... worldly for them. Well, then it's Tony Vallelonga. All these high-class people, so much smarter than me, with their intelligence and speaking abilities, you're telling me they can't pronounce my name? They don't like it, they can shove it up their ass, I'll just wait outside. That sound compromised. Ladies and gentlemen, tonight we are privileged to present a great American artist. He gave his first public performance at the age of three. At age eighteen, at Arthur Fiedler's invitation, our guest made his concert debut with the Boston Pops. He holds Doctorates in Psychology, in Music, and in the Liturgical Arts and he had performed at the White House twice in the past fourteen months. He is a true virtuoso. Virtuoso... that's Italian. Means he's really good. So Ladies and gentleman, please welcome The Don Shirley Trio! Hey, it's your dice, I'm just having a lucky night. Tony. Boss man's calling. He ain't my boss. I work for the record company. I work for the record company too. Come on man! Give us a chance to win back our loot! I'm sorry, fellas, duty calls! Duty calls? Look man, my duty is getting my money back. I've been looking for you. Yeah sorry. The guys were having a little game. Next time you need extra money, you just ask me. More fun winning it. Then what if you lost? Craps and cards, I don't lose, Doc. I don't lose. So stooping down in the gravel pitching dice for pocket change makes you a winner? What are you giving me shit for? Everybody was doing it. They didn't have a choice whether to be inside or out. You did. And wipe off your knees, you have dirt on them. Dear Dolores... How are you? I am fine... I'm eating real good, hamburgers mostly so don't worry about me not eating good. I saw Dr. Shirley play the piano. Tonight. He doesn't play like a colored guy. He plays like Liberace but better. He's like a genius I think. When I look at him in the rear-view mirror, I can tell he's always thinking about stuff in his head. I guess that's what geniuses do. But it don't look fun to be that smart. I miss you very very much. - Who is this? - Who? On the radio? Lil' Richard. Really? That's Little Richard? Yeah. Think you could play something like this, Doc? I don't know. Sounds very complicated. Ain't that right. So where did this “Tony the Lip” moniker come from? It's not Tony the Lip. It's Tony Lip. One word. I got it when I was a kid. Because my friends said I was the best bullshit artist in the Bronx. - Why are you smiling? - What do you mean? It doesn't bother you that your friends, the people closest to you, consider you a liar? Who said liar? I said bullshit artist. - Then what's the difference? - Cause I don't lie. Ever. I'm just good at talking people into, you know, doing things they don't wanna do. By bulletin 'em. And you're proud of that? Well it got me this job. Wait a minute. You're full of shit! You never heard of Chubby Checker? Of course I've heard of him, I just never heard his music before. But I like this. This is nice. He's got a silky voice... very smooth. This is what everybody is dancing to now. Eyes on the road Tony. You know this song? - I don't think so. No. - How could you not know this music? Aretha Frank. Chubby Checker, Lil' Richard, Sam Cooke. Come on Doc, these are your people! - You want anything? I'm gonna pack smoke. - No thank you. Nice turn Mike, what he makes it up? Snatch an apple Doc. Before we pull out Tony, we need to have a talk. - Yeah? - Oleg told me what you did. What I do? You stole a jade stone from the store. - No I didn't. - He watched you do it. I didn't steal no stone. You picked it up and you put it in your pocket. I picked up a rock up off the ground. I didn't steal from the box. Now why would you pick up a rock off the ground? I don't know. 'Cause that ain't stealing. Just a regular rock. And why would you want a regular rock? To have. - For luck maybe. - A lucky rock. - Yeah. - Let me see it. Take it back and pay for it. I told you that Kraut was a sneak. Rats me out for something I didn't even do. Pay for the stone, Tony, you'll feel better. I feel fine. And I ain't paying for no regular rock I found in the dirt. Do not drive, Mr. Vallelonga. Put it back. - You feel better? - No. If you'd like, Tony, I would happily buy you that stone. Don't bother. You took all the fun out of it. Excuse me, Sir. - I'm with the band. - You're all set up. - This isn't the piano, right? - That's it. It ain't a Steinway. So what? Dr. Shirley only plays on Steinway-brand pianos. It's in his written contract. - Who's Dr. Shirley? - Dr. Shirley... the Don Shirley Trio? They're playing tonight. - Does it really matter? - Yeah, it does, to this contract. Come on man, these coons can play on anything you put in front of them. But it's a piece of shit. And there is garbage in there. - So, take it out. - What'd you say? You heard me. Hey, you got 2-3 hours. Just get a clean Steinway in here. - There ain't no Steinway on campus. - Not my problem. I bet there is not two Steinway in the whole state of Indiana. I guess you better move your ass then. Who do you think you're talking to, grease ball? Dear Dolores... This morning I had steak and eggs. For breakfast. The band has been playing at very ritzy joints. Dr. Shirley and I are getting along pretty good, but sometimes I think he gets sad and that's why he drinks too much. I never knew how very beautiful this country was. Now that I'm seeing it I know. You wouldn't believe how beautiful nature is, it is as beautiful as they say. And the traffic out here in the country is nothing, which is fine by me. “Right now I'm eating spaghetti and meatballs in a diner that tastes like ketchup on Chinese noodles. “We are heading down south now... I will write you another letter when we get down south. I love you. - Your husband Tony. P.S. - Kiss the kids for me. You got any family, Doc? - Not really. - Not really? Either you do or you don't. It's a long story, Tony. What, we're in a hurry now? Let's hear it. I have a brother somewhere. We used to get together once in a while... but it got more and more difficult to stay in touch. Curse of being a musician I guess. Always on the road like a carnival worker. Or a criminal. Took quite a toll on my marriage as well. - You're married? - Was. June, good person. Terrible grammar, but a kind soul. - You'll quite like her. - June? Like month? Unfortunately, I couldn't do a husband act and a concert pianist act. Couldn't seem to manage both worlds. Kentucky Fried Chicken. In Kentucky! When's that ever gonna happen?! - Hey, you want some? - I'm fine. Thank you Tony. I think this is the best Kentucky Fried Chicken I ever had. But I guess it's fresher down here, right? I don't think I've ever met anyone with your appetite. No, I bought the bucket so you could have some. I've never had fried chicken in my life. Who you bulletin? You people love the fried chicken, the grits, the colored greens I love it, too. The negro cooks used to make it all time when I was in the army. You have a very narrow assessment of me, Tony. Yeah right? I'm good. No, you're not good, you're bad. I'm saying, just because other Negros enjoy certain types of music, it doesn't mean I have to. Nor do we all have to eat the same kind food. Wait a minute. If you said all guineas like pizza and spaghetti and meatballs - I'm not gonna get insulted. - Well, you're missing the point. For you to make the assumption that every Negro... - Hey, you want some or not? - No. Here. Come on. - Tell me that don't smell good? - It smells okay I prefer not to get grease on my blanket. Ooh, I'm gonna get grease on my blankie. Come on, have a piece. It ain't gonna kill ya. Come on. Take it easy. - No. - Take it. - I'm gonna throw it in the back. - Don't you dare. - Then you better take it. - How? Do you have plates? Or utensils? Bah fongool! Eat it with your hands, - that's how you're supposed to. - I can't do that. Eat it. Come on. Take it. I gotta drive. Ten and two on the wheels. Take it. Take it. Come on. There you go. - I can't do this Tony. - Eat the goddamn thing. Jesus. What, no good? Just seems... so unsanitary. Who gives a shit? Just relax and enjoy it. My father used to say, whatever you do, do it a hundred percent. When you work, work, when you laugh, laugh, when you eat, eat like it's your last meal. You want another piece? Here, have a breast. Delicious. Take it. There you go. What do we do about the bones? We do this. This is what we do. There you go. What's the big deal with that? Squirrels will eat it anyway. This can't be right. Says right here. Cozy as your own home. Place looks like my ass. This is the place. Square one please. - Just this one? - Thank you. Hey... Uh... If you need anything, I'll be right up the street at the Easton Inn. Thank you Tony. - Hey Floyd, we ready? - Tulley, I can't play, my problem. Hey, fancy-pants, you wanna play? - I beg your pardon. - Come on brother, we short in men. I... I'd rather not. What, you too high and mighty? He's just afraid of getting that butler uniform all that dusty! I'm just... I'm on my way out to meet a friend. Yeah, thanks for nothing? - Floyd, come on man. - Shut your ass up man, leave me alone. Vacation without aggravation. Delightful dinners for particular people. - Yeah? - Get up! It's George. Get up. Tony come on. Hurry up! Dr. Shirley's in trouble. I went out for a drink, I walk into this bar, and Dr Shirley's in there getting bounced around! I didn't want to leave him, but I didn't know what to do! Who let him out of his cage? And they put that little tie on him too? Who you are dressed out? Get your hands off him. What in the good goddamn we got here, fellas? Hand him over, we walk out, won't be a problem. I just wanted a drink Tony. Hey, I told you, we'll leave. Not a big deal. Come on. He ain't going nowhere, we need a Brillo pad to wash them dishes with. Listen assholes, do yourself a favor and let him go. Now! Say it nice. I just said it nice. This boy's gonna get what he's got coming to him. And you... you ain't got no say! Maybe. But, whatever happens here, I'm gonna put a bullet right in the middle of your thick skull. He ain't got no gun, Ray. He's fulla shit. What if he ain't? Well, I sure ain't. And I ain't about to let this come to pass in my place. Let the spook go. Let him go. Come on. Get him outta here. I want these Yankees off from my property. - Go home. - Come on George, go, go. Go home. You out of your mind? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to put you in that position. Wait, wait, wait! You wanna throw up again? I'm OK. Hones to God Doc, I don't understand you. You could have drunk here. You got a whole bottle. - I just needed some air. - Air? Do you know where you are? Does the geography really matter? - What? - If I was in a bar... in your neighborhood, would... the conversation be any different? From now on you don't go nowhere without me. Nowhere! - Got it? - I understand. - Where is your room? - Tony. What? Do you really have a gun? 'Course not. Doc, where's your goddamn room? - There it is. - Come on. Over there? Let me get you to bed Doc. You got a big show tomorrow night. C'mon. Louisville. Thank you for your warm hospitality! Thank you. - Don't be lazy Tony, enunciate. - I ain't. - Betty bought a bit of better butter. - Betty bought. Betty bought... butter... Who says that? Butter uh... you have to start somewhere Tony. A singer does vocal exercises, an athlete warms up, before they rehearse. Athletes practice, they don't rehearse. Ah, shit! Ladies and gentlemen, our very special guest from the far north... Don Shirley! Accompanying Mr. Shirley, the members of his trio... Oleg Malakhov, George Dyer, and his associate, Tony Vallla... Valleg... Valle... Valley... lohnja. This is my lovely wife Margaret. If you gentlemen don't mind, I'm going to steal Donnie away for some introductions. - What's that? - Pimiento-cheese sandwich, sir. Yeah, I'll try that one. Sorry! Not for me. Earlier this week, we asked our help what Mr. Shirley might like for supper. So the boys in the kitchen whipped up a special menu in honor of our guest. Gentlemen. Home cooked fried chicken. There you go. Bring them in. Serve it up hot. Thank you. We return after a brief intermission. - Excuse me, Don. Lovely work in there. - Why! Thank you! Are you looking for the commode? Here, let me help you. Right out there 'fore that pine. I'd prefer not to use that. Well, don't be silly, Don. It looks a lot worse from the outside. And I'd suppose you'd know from experience. What? Never had any complains. Well, I could return to my motel and use the facilities there. But... that would take at least a half an hour. We don't mind waiting. Why don't I just pull over... You can piss in the woods? Animals go in the woods. But it's gonna be at least twenty minutes if I gotta go all the way back to your motel. So let's just get there so I can go back and finish the show. See, that's the difference between you and me. - I'd have zero problem goin' in the woods. - I'm well aware. Why you sore at me? I don't make the rules down here. No? Then who does? Oh! you saying just 'cause I'm white and they're white? You know, that's a very prejudice thing you just said there. A very prejudice thing. I got more in common with the hymies at Second Avenue Deli than I do with these hillbilly pricks down here. - Eyes on the road. - You always say that when - you don't like what I'm saying. - Eyes on the road! I don't get it. How does he smile and shake their hands like that? If they tried to pull that outhouse shit on me, I'd piss right on their living room floor. Don't do that. We have many concert dates left. Yeah... So...? You realize we are contractually obliged to perform them? Of course I do. You don't play, we don't get paid. What's your point? Ugly circumstances are going to happen again. - So control yourself. - Don't lecture me, you rat. Dr. Shirley could've stayed up north getting rear-end kissed at Park Avenue parties for three times money but he asked for this. Why? What on God's green earth are you doing? A letter. Looks more like a piecemeal ransom note. May I? Dear, Dolores... D-E-A-R, this isn't animal. I'm meeting all the highly leading citizens of the town. People that use big words, all of them but you know me, I get by, I'm a good bullshitter. Two “t”s in “bullshitter.” As I'm writing this letter, I'm eating potato chips and I'm starting to get thirsty. I washed my socks and dried them on the TV. - I should have brung the iron. - You know this is pathetic right? Tell me what you're trying to say. - You know, how I miss her and shit. - You didn't say that. But do it in a manner that no one else has ever done it before. And without the profanity. Something like... Put this down. - Dear Dolores... - Oh God no! D-E-A-R, Dolores. When-I-think-of-you... I'm-reminded of-the-beautiful plains of Iowa. What planes? The plains. P-L-A-I-N-S. Those big fields we saw. Yeah, those were nice. PLAINS. Which what they call big fields around here. Tony, no expounding. - A what? - Just write what I say. - I'm good. - The distance between us is breaking my spirit... between us... My time and experiences without you are meaningless to me. Falling in love with you was the easiest thing I have ever done. Falling... in love... with you... is very fucking romantic. It was the easiest thing I have ever done. Nothing matters to me but you. And everyday I am alive, I'm aware of this. I loved you the day I met you, I love you today... And I will love you to rest of my life. - So can I put the “P.S., kiss the kids”? - A P.S.? Yeah, like a the end. That's like clanging a cowbell at the end of Shostakovitch's 7th. Right... So that's good? It's perfect Tony. Everybody talks about Willie Maze, 1954, wasn't even the greatest catcher in the polo grounds. That was Joe, 1936, 2nd game at world series, final out, 500 feet... Do you like that Doc? - That's a handsome suit. - Sharp. Guy looks just like you. He does? Oh... Size-wise. Yeah! He's about a forty two. Why don't you try on that? What, you gotta wear a tuxedo on stage every night? You could mix it up a little back. Now, see how that looks on you. We got plenty of time. I'll be right back. - How you doing? - May I help you sir? Yeah. We wanna try on that beautiful Grey suit in the window. - You got it in a 42? - Of course. - That's the one. - Dressing room's in the back, sir. Thank you. That'll be just a moment. Take your time Doc, I'll check out some ties for you. Uh, excuse me, you're not allowed to try that on. I beg your pardon? If you would like to purchase it first, we'll be happy to tailor it to your needs. I see. Yeah? F me. Hey officer, I got a call about Dr. Shirley. Come on. His friends hate her. Thank you. Give the guy a towel, for Chrissakes? - You the lawyer? - No. Well you should call one. We're taking your Auntie in. For what? Manager caught him and the other guy... Can't we get the cuffs off him, let him put his pants on? We talk about this? Sure we could. But we ain't. OK, look, we're out of here tomorrow morning... you'll never see us again. There's gotta be something due to work this out. What if, uh, you let him go, and I give you something to thank you? - You bribing us? - No. Hell no. A gift. - A thank you. - What kind of thank you? Like... a donation to the police force. To you guys. Whatever you want. You like suits? I was walking through your nice town today, and I seen a store that was selling suits. Primo suits. What if... as a thank you... a donation... I buy you each a suit? You get all dressed up, you take the wife out for dinner. I mean... Guys like you, you work hard, you deserve it. They were wrong for the way they treated me, and you rewarded them. I was hired to get you from one show to the next. How I do it shouldn't matter to you. - I just wish you hadn't paid them off. - I did what I had to do. You know, if this got out it would kill your career. OK. Tony. I need you to stop it with your phony altruism and concern for my career. What the hell does that mean? You were only thinking about yourself back there because you know if I miss a show, it comes out of your pocket book. Of course I don't want you to miss a show, you ungrateful bastard! You think I'm doing this for my health? Tonight I saved your ass, so show a little appreciation... Maybe? Besides, I told you never to go nowhere without me! I assumed you would want this to be the exception. Want me to get some makeup or something before the show? No I'm fine. - You sure? Bruise kindda shrugs. - I said I'm fine. Okay. Tony Lip? Dominic. The hell you guys doing here? Brooklyn sent us down... take care of a few things. I am working here. Sorry Doc, they are some friends from New York. Hey, you get Dr Shirley's luggage? Alright. Called his room. He'll be down in a minute. - Hey Doc. - Where are you off to? Just going downstairs. To have a drink. Tony... I think you're doing a wonderful job. So... I would like to formally offer you the position of my road manager. With the title... also comes more responsibility but that also means a raise in pay. No. No. No, thanks. I mean, we agreed on a hundred and twenty-five a week, plus expenses. That's our deal. Right? I ain't goin' nowhere, Doc. I was just goin' down to tell 'em. Tony... I'm sorry about last night. Don't worry about it. I been working nightclubs in the New York city my whole life... I know it's... complicated world. So, where'd you learn how to play like that? My mother. Your mother... Really? She taught me how to play in an old spinet. Soon as I could walk. Travel around the Florida panhandle... Put on my little shows and perishes in halls... Fortunately a man who had seen me play arranged for me to study at the Leningrad Conservatory of Music. I was the first Negro ever accepted there. So that's where they taught you all them songs you play? Actually, I was trained to play classical music. Brahms, Franz Liszt, Beethoven, Chopin... it's all I ever wanted to play. But I was persuaded by my record company to pursue a career in popular music instead. They insisted that audiences would never accept a negro pianist on the classical stage. Wanted to turn me into just another “colored entertainer.” You know the guy who... smoking while he's playing, sets a glass of whiskey on his piano and then he complains because he's not respected like Arthur Rubinstein. You don't see Arthur Rubenstein putting a glass of whiskey on his piano. I don't know... I think if you stuck to that classic stuff it would've been a big mistake. A mistake? Performing the music I trained my entire life to play? Trained? What are you, a seal? People love what you do. Anyone can sound like Beethoven or Joe Pan or them other guys you said. But your music, what you do... Only you can do that. Thank you Tony. But... not everyone can play Chopin... not like I can. The trees have shed their leafy clothing and their colors have faded to grays and browns. I saw a millions of trees all dusted with snow just like out of a fairy tale. Oh, he's so expressive. Gotta admit, Lip's letters... - They are not bad. - Oh well! It's in the family. They say our great, great, great grandfather helped Da Vinci with the Sixteen Chapel. You mean Michelangelo? Right. What is Michelangelo have to do with writing letters? - I'm just saying, we're an arty family. - I would count the hours... minutes... and seconds... until you are in my arms. Love you, Tony. P.S. KISS THE KIDS. - John. - Yeah? I want a letter. Yeah, as soon as you make a meal. Eyes on the road. Tony. Alright everybody! Let's give a finest Louisiana welcome to Don Shirley and the Don Shirley Trio! Your mother's ass... piece of shit. Hell's this guy doing? Son of a bitch. License and papers? Am I glad to see you. We had a turn off from main road... and uh, now we're lost. - Step out of the car. - What I do? Out of the car. Why you on this road? I told you, we had to make a detour and we got lost. And why you driving him? He's my boss. He can't be out here at night. This is a sundown town. What's that? - Get him out of the car. Check his I.D. - Come on, it's pouring rain sir. I can just get it right here through the window. Get him out of the car! - Come on. - Get out now! Get out! You got ID? How you say this last name? Vallelonga. 'Hell kind of name is that? It's Italian. Oh, now I see. That's why you driving him around. You half a nigger yourself. Hands in the air, now, now! Excuse me. Excuse me, sirs. I understand why my associate is being held, but what exactly am I being charged with? You seem like reasonable men. Perhaps you could let me out so that we could discuss the situation further? Just put the apple butter away, boy. You ain't goin' nowhere no time soon. - You cannot hold me without cause! - Well I got cause. 'Cause you let the sun set on your black ass! I want to speak to my lawyer, I want my call! This is a flagrant violation of my rights! You know... He does have... rights. Give the negro his goddamn phone call. You happy? You know a lawyer? Call him. As my mother always said, “What kind of brand new fool are you?!” Look at them over there. Take a good look at the officer you hit. Look at him. He's over there having a grand old time, chatting up his pals enjoying a nice cup of coffee. And where are you? In here, with me, who did nothing. Yet I'm the one who's pays the price. I'm the one who's gonna miss the Birmingham show. Hey, I'm losing a lot of money, too, if you don't play Birmingham. So that little temper tantrum... was it worth it? You don't win with violence, Tony, you win when you maintain your dignity. Dignity always prevails. And tonight, because of you, we did not. I wouldn't touch that mattress Doc. No sir. No. No I'm not sir. Yes, sir, he's right here, yes sir. - Yes sir. - Give me. Chief Pratt... who's this? Bull-oney. Yes sir. I can hear it now, Governor. No sir, I'm sorry. But, of course I recognize your voice. Sir... You saying the boy we got locked up called who? Oh, and he called you? No sir, but an officer was assaulted in the line of... No, no, I don't want no National Guard coming down here, neither, sir. Yes, Governor, immediately. Good night to you and the missus. - Get them out. - What?! - Cut 'em goddamn loose. - That dago-wop hit me! You keep your goddamn job? Then you do what I goddamn tell you to do, when I goddamn tell you to do it. Now I'm telling you to get 'em the goddamn out. Who the hell did you call? Bobby Kennedy just saved our asses! Maddon... How great is that?! It's not great. It's not great at Al, it's humiliating. 'The hell you talking about? We were screwed, now we ain't. And I just put the Attorney General of the United - States in an incredibly awkward position. - So what? That's what the guy gets paid for. What else he got to do? That man and his brother are trying to change this country, that's what else he's got to do! Now he thinks I'm some kind of... Calling from some backwoods swamp jail, asking to attenuate assault charges... who does that? Garbage, that's who. You shouldn't have hit him. I didn't like the way he was treating you, making you stand out in the rain like that. Please, you hit him because of what he called you. I've had to endure that kind of talk my entire life, you should be able to take it for at least one night. What, I can't get mad at that stuff he was saying 'cause I ain't black? - Christ, I'm blacker than you. - Excuse me? You don't know shit about your own people! What they eat, how they talk, how they live. You don't even know who Lil' Richard is! Oh so knowing who Little Richard is makes you blacker than me? Oh Tony, I wish you could hear yourself sometimes - you wouldn't talk so damn much. - Bullshit. I know exactly who I am. I'm the guy who's lived on the same neighborhood in the Bronx my entire life, with my mother, my father, my brother, and now my wife and kids. That's it, that's who I am. I'm the asshole who's gotta hustle every goddamn day to put food out on table. You? Mr. Big Shot? You live on top of a castle traveling around the world doing concerts for rich people... I live on the streets, you sit on a throne so yeah, my world is way more blacker than yours! Pull over. - What? - Pull over. - I ain't pulling over! - Stop the car Tony! What? What are you doing?! Doc, what the hell are you doing? Doc, get back in the car. Yes, I live in a castle! Tony. Alone! And rich white people pay me to play piano for them, because it makes them feel cultured. But as soon as I step off that stage I go right back to being just another nigger to them. Because that is their true culture. And I suffer that slight alone, because I'm not accepted by my own people, because I'm not like them either! So if I'm not black enough, and if I'm not white enough, and if I'm not man enough, then tell me Tony, what am I?! I need some sleep. A'right. I'll stop by the next place we see and I'll sneak you into my room. No. No. I refuse to stay in an establishment where I'm not welcome. Yeah. OK. Tony, do you have to smoke everywhere? I didn't know it would bother you. Should have told me. All you gotta do, is say the word Doc. You do realize you'd be home before that letter arrives? Yeah, I know. Just thought of bringing it with me. Save on the stamps. A'right, Tony. Give it here, I'll fix it. No offense, Doc, but I think I got the hang of it now. Dear Dolores. Sometimes you remind me of a house. A house with beautiful lights on it where everyone happy inside. Yes, Tony! You go it. Thanks. Doc, thanks for helping me with the letters. - You're really good at writing them. - My pleasure Tony. You know, when you get home, maybe you should write one to your brother? He knows where I am if he ever wants to reconnect. If... I wouldn't wait. You know... the world's full of lonely people afraid to make the first move. You know Doc, something's been eating at me this whole trip. That Tittsburgh was a major disappointment. I didn't notice any difference at all. Did you? Good night Tony. - Good Evening. Welcome. - Welcome. Come on in. Welcome Mr Shirley. Graham Kindell, I'm the general manager. It is a pleasure to meet you. Thank you, Mr. Kindell. This is Mr. Tony Vallelonga. - Nice to meet you, Tony. - How you doing? Let's keep the car right here on our guest of honor spot. Right this way, gentlemen. - How was your drive up? - Oh it's wonderful. Good to hear, good to hear. As you can imagine our Christmas show is the biggest show of the year and we are so happy to have you here Mr Shirley. So, if you need anything... anything t'all... you let me know. - Oh thank you. - Now, here we are... I got about an hour before show time. Any questions? Where's the restaurant? Well, you continue down the hall here, Tony, to the right, across the lobby. - Good luck! Break a leg. - Thank you. He said we've got an hour. You must be starving Doc. Go ahead, I'll meet you there. May we join you? Get in. - Cocktail, gentlemen? - I'm good. - 3 shots Vodka. - Whoa! Last show. Cold war over. Time for truce. - Is Dr Shirley in his dressing room? - Yeah. More like a broom closet. Tell you, I don't know why he puts up with that shit. Six years ago, in 1956, Nat King Cole was invited to perform at the Municipal Auditorium here in Birmingham. Mr. Cole was the first negro asked to play at a white establishment in this city. As soon as he started playing, a group of men attacked him for playing white people's music. They pulled him off stage beat him badly. Jesus Christ! You asked once why Dr. Shirley does this? I tell you. Because genius is not enough. It takes courage to change people's hearts. Thanks. Thank you. - I understand but... - What's going on? This gentleman says that I'm not permitted dine here. No, you don't understand, he's playing tonight, he's the main event. I'm sorry. But it's the policy of the restaurant. - Everything all right? - No, it's not all right. This guy is saying Dr Shirley can't eat here. Well, I apologize, but these are... longstanding traditions. Club rules. I'm sure you understand. No. I do not understand. I'm sorry. Wait a minute, are you tellin' me the bozos in his band, and these people that came here to see him play, they can eat here, but the star of the show, spot of honor, he can't. I'm afraid not. Well he's gotta eat, I mean he's gotta have dinner. I tell you what. Why don't we bring something to his dressing room, huh? John, show him the menu. No. I'm not eating in that storage room. Okay... if you'd prefer, there's a very popular establishment right down the road, the Orange Bird, they'd be happy to feed you. Doc, come here. One second just. C'mon, maybe that place is better anyway. The dinner rolls here are like rocks. Let's just go over... just go and come back. It's the last show. Bottom of the knife. Let's just get it over with and we can go home and get away from these pricks. Ah, there you go, the fish is wonderful tonight. Either I eat in this room, or I'm not performing tonight. May I have a word with you? Mr. Villanueva, you have to talk sense to Mr. Shirley. Please make him understand we're not insulting him personally, this is just the way things are done down here. Yeah, well he's not from down here. Just ask him to be reasonable. I got 400 guests in there who expect to be entertained tonight. And Dr. Shirley expects to eat tonight. Why can't you just make an exception this one time? Lemme tell you a story. You ever hear of the Boston Celtics basketball club? Yeah, those boys came through here a couple years ago on a barnstorming tour. Now, seeing as they were World Champions of the league and all, we were tickled to have 'em eat here, we rolled out the welcome wagon. So do you know what table their big coon ate at that night? - No. - I don't either. But it wasn't one of ours. Now let's cut the bullshit. Tell me what it's gonna take. Say one hundred dollars and you get your boy to play? You think you can buy me? With all due respect, sir, but you wouldn't be in a job like this if you couldn't be bought. Stop! Tony. It's alright. I'll play. If you want me to. Let's get the fuck outta here. What do you mean, let's get outta here? Where the hell do you think you're going? Don, don't do this! Now you signed a contract. And I know you're the kind of man who honors a contract! You got a show to do, mister! You turn yourself around. Right now goddammit! Right now! This is why you people don't work down here, cause you're unreliable. You hear me? I shipped that goddamn Steinway in from Atlanta for you. Tony. Are you hungry? Does Betty like butter? - You a cop? - Do I look Irish? - What you want, baby? - Two Cutty's, neat. Whatever your specialty is, we'll take it. Two orange birds! I like what you did back there, Doc. You stood up for yourself. It's like your friend the President says “Ask not your country what you could do for it, ask what you do for yourself.” So, darlin', what you do, all dressed up like that? Nothing particularly important. Shouldn't judge a man by his clothes. He's only the greatest piano player in the world. That right? You good? - Don't be shy, Doc. Tell her who you are. - Don't tell me nothing, show me. Man... That's how you break a peak. Oh, that was a good time, I do that once a month for free. - You're unbelievable. - Hey Tony. I bet if we leave right now, we can make it. - Make what? - Christmas Eve. In New York city. Don't ever flash a wad of cash in a bar. I knew you had a gun! It's getting bad Doc. Yes. It's a shame we don't have something to protect us on our journey. Oh I know, why don't you put your lucky rock up on the dash, Tony? C'mon Tony, we need all the help we can get. Thank you. I feel safer already. You're a prick, you know that? Ah, shit! Goddamn cops. - What are you doing out here? - We're trying to get to New York. - Is there a problem, Officer? - Yeah. I noticed your car was tilting to the left. Looks like your back tire's flat. Ah! Keep it moving, keep it moving. OK. Be careful gentlemen. - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! Thanks officer. Weather advisory warning this Christmas Eve, as a major snowstorm is hitting the eastern seaboard with the severest weather in eastern Pennsylvania, northern New Jersey and the five boroughs. Travelers are advised to stay off the Jersey Turnpike... A'right. That's it. We're done. I'm pulling us into the next motel. - Keep going as long as you can go Tony. - I can't keep my eyes open. I'm getting hypnotized here. I think my brain's gonna explode. Hey... we gave it a shot Doc. What you gonna do? Alright, the table is set, ladies and gentlemen. Don't run in the house. Tony. Tony, wake up. - You alright? - You're home, get inside. Goodnight. Wait, wait, come up, meet my family...? Merry Christmas Tony. Merry Christmas! Look who it is, Shakespeare's home! I made it back! Tony, God bless you! - You hungry? - I'm starving. - Welcome home, Dr. Shirley. - Thank you, Amit. I turned down your bed, sir. Shall I unpack your luggage now? No, no, please. Go home to your family. Thank you sir. - Merry Christmas Sir. - Merry Christmas! Come on. You never kissed me like that. A'right, relax. So Tony, you alright? You seem a little quite. Yeah, nah, I'm just tired. Long trip. You take care of that thing? - Thanks. - Yeah, you owe me 75 bucks. Seventy five? Charlie said sixty. I'm doing this for free? Hey, Tony, tell us about the trip. You're gone 2 months. Yeah. So how was he, the tootsune? He get on your nerves? Don't call him that. Alright. Tony, you should have seen the day last week when little Frankie climbed upon the TV. I took a picture of him. He was so cute. He was so funny up there. What are you nuts, Dee? With all the tubes back there, he could've got electrocuted! - Charlie? - Hey Lip. Johnny invited me. - Well, come on in. - You remember Marie? Hey Marie! Charlie, you actually came? I was kidding? With the wife too? - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, hello! What a surprise! Everybody. Charlie from the pawn shop! Doc! Welcome! - Hey, everybody... - Stop it, stop it. This is Dr Donald Shirley. Merry Christmas. Well, come on, make some room! Get the man a plate! - Hello! - You must be Dolores. - Welcome! - Buon Natale. Thank you for sharing your husband with me. Thank you for helping him with the letters. Subtitled by CLARITY.
