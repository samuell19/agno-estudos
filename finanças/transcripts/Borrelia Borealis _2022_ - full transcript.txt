As the global pandemic rages on, deaths in the United States have reached an all time high, crossing the 2 million mark. Tensions are high in Washington today as lawmakers attempt to tighten up a more coordinated national response. As the Southern California Vincent Fire overtakes Malibu and the West Hills, residents fear the upcoming aggressive and historically unpredictable Santa Ana Winds will blow sparks, igniting other parts of Los Angeles. The White House doctors today said that immunocompromised people, those with cancer, autoimmune disorders, and the elderly, must be extra careful as we enter the second wave. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi, it's good to see you. Oh, it's great to see you Beth. So, how was your weekend? What did you guys do? Oh, you know, we had a quiet weekend here, just a couple of movies. I expect just, you know, the same thing as everyone else, but we tried to layer in some, like, active time too, - and went on a couple of walks. - Yeah. No, like the garden, the garden that you guys, you guys planted a garden, you... your, um... your husband, I saw on Facebook. He was, like, posting, like, when you and your daughter like digging up, like, you know, soil and like planting tomatoes, like, oh, my God. What a great guy he must be. Like, he is so handsome. Oh, you are... Well, you're both lucky. You're both very attractive people. You're lucky to have each other. I'm alone. Thank you. Thanks Beth. What about the walks? Have you been taking any walks Beth? No, if I got coughed on, like, I would die, so I don't... I don't want to go outside. I... I can't see straight sometimes. And, like, I don't, um... It feels like someone's shaking me and then it's like, everything kind of goes blurry. But, I mean, it doesn't last very long, but I just, like, I just don't feel very stable. I feel like I'm not doing anything else, but trying to get better and I'm not getting better. It is traumatic, in some ways, in order to change the system around, and it's changed the way it's functioning, but it is necessary to do this for a more prolonged lasting wellness. My brain and my body are not... connected. The things we do experience, and the... the trauma that... that affects us, that it does affect, and it does translate into the body. You were bitten by a tick at the age of ten. You want your life back. You want your life back. I never had a life, though. I never had a life to get back. I want to start my life because I've had this for 25 years. So it's like I... I don't even have a jumping off point yet. Unfortunately, back then, there really were no Lyme literate doctors. It wasn't a part of our vocabulary. Look at it like this, Beth. Early childhood trauma loads the gun for chronic conditions. Auto immune diseases like Lyme pull the trigger. Functional whole body medicine has come a long way. That's why we treat the body and the mind. You can't have one without the other. How has it been going talking with your parents? Have you confronted them yet? I believe you that this is hard and this is not something I take lightly. We've tried years of antibiotics, vegan, Paleo, talk therapy and EDMR, support groups, biofeedback and float tanks. Nothing has brought your inflammation levels down. Nothing. Not confronting your parents, it's making you sicker, Beth. There's a house on a street by the sea... with faded blue shingles, weathered to gray. It's lights burning bright, but never for me. I have a question for you. If you knew then, when you were punishing me, when you were... when you were hitting me with a belt and the switch, if you knew then that it would make me grow up to be someone... who does this... every day, multiple times a day, would you still do it? Would you still do it? I just want to know. I have no self-esteem. And I don't know if that was just by design. Like, I don't know if you guys... you guys did all that so... so you would break me down and I wouldn't have my own identity and I would just follow your very strict rules. I don't... I don't know if that was the desired effect. Maybe it was. Well, we all know I... I couldn't... I couldn't follow those rules. I think that everything that you guys did to me when I was a kid, I stuffed down so deep... until one day my body just let it all go. And now we're here. Who is this person? Eddie. Eddie. You want to talk so bad? Hi, is this Beth? - Yeah! - It's me, Eddie. We have a date tonight, I think. There's like 50 Beth Cs on here, shit! Huh? I'm supposed to... I'm supposed to be on this date, a video date, uh, pandemic style. Is this like some kind of troll thing? No, I made a mistake. Honest mistake, okay. I was chatting with this girl on one of those free dating apps. Mixed bag, you know? Maybe I was meant to call you by accident. Huh? You believe in fate? Ooh, okay, yeah, I... I see. So like, you're just like some, like, internet scam artist. No. No. We could all use a friend right now. I don't have anybody to talk to. - I was supposed to be out on a date... - Clearly. And I wouldn't mind talking to someone and... and I... I mean, if you don't mind, I... I'd like to chat a little bit. You know, I didn't mean to interrupt what was go... I... I didn't mean anything like that. I'm trying to... I'm kind of nervous. I don't go on... on too many dates... Oh, you don't say? Oh, you're still here? Are you okay? I am not having a good day. So, I'm really sorry that I... No, no, I'm... I'm sorry, I clearly interrupted. And, um... Which was not my intention at all. Listen, I mean, I don't know how long this has lasted already, but, I mean, we've come this far, so, hey, why don't... Hi, I'm... I'm Eddie, and, uh, it's... it's nice to meet you. Um, I'll extend my hand to you. - There... There you go. - Okay. - Okay. - So now we know each other. I'm... I'm from... I'm from New England. New England. Are you a fisherman? I do a little bit of fishing. - Yeah? - I used to fish, I don't... Like lobsters and shit? I love to eat lobsters. There it is. You get the lobsters, you get the lobsters from the boats. - Lobsters. - I eat a lot of lobsters. I can't have shellfish, man. You're allergic to shellfish? No, I'm not allergic, but I have... So I have Lyme disease, and like, there's all this shit you can't eat. Like, I can't eat fucking anything. Like, I can't have anything that comes in a shell. I can't have beef. I can't have coffee. I can't have peppermint. I can't have the cheese. Oh, I'd fucking give my life for one of those Cheddar Bay Biscuits. You... You have really pretty eyes. You're flirting with me, aren't you? Well, I have to say I'm out of practice, so, uh, I'm... I'm glad it's going well so far. Oh... oh, no. But I will say, I... I want to know more about your wall because your apartment looks amazing. So, like, what other cool stuff do you got going on in there? So you, like, want to get to know me a little bit? You wanna... You like genuinely want to know who I am. I'm enjoying talking to you. Um, yeah, I... I like you... I like you too. Like you're... you're pretty cool. But remember, this isn't a date. This is definitely not a date. It's just a... It's just a conversation of friends. Right? I'm a little... I'm... I'm up past my bedtime, I'm a little tired. So, maybe, um... Maybe I'll just, like, show you the bedroom real fast. - All right, okay. - But it's gonna be a platonic bed situation with no boobs. - No boobs! - And nothing... No funny business. Well, I'll let you in on a little secret. - I brought protection. - Ohh! I don't even want to know what that means. Did you get it? Because, I mean, we're... It's a video chat, right? So, like, you can't get hepatitis like this. That's right. It's very safe, you know, it's... How'd you sleep last night? Mm, pretty good, actually. All right, would it be weird to ask you on a date tonight? I was gonna ask you on a date. Now we're doing the traditional gender role thing. Yes, yes, I say yes to a date with you. I'll even let you pay if you're worried about the patriarchy. - How about it? - Toots! I wanted you to call me Toots there. It's a balance. How about it, Toots? Yes, I will pick you up around six, nine, your time? Perfect, it's a date. I'll see you then, pretty lady. See you then, stud. Frustration in major cities this week as the homeless flood the streets with nowhere left to turn, many recently evicted due to the financial burden of the pandemic. Mayors are struggling to contain the virus with so many displaced people and no federal assistance. Those dying of the deadly virus this year are dying alone, a new study shows. Doesn't that sound strange to you at all? He accidentally video called you? I don't know if that's strange. I mean, people are doing video calls all the time, right? - Like people... - Yes, with people that they know, established people in their lives. Not with strangers with no last names and no proof of who they are or where they're from - or what they're doing... - He's in New England. - He lives in New England. - New England? - Yeah. - Oh... So no specific state, no specific city. What does he do? He... What is his history like? - He... - Is he a felon? That's not fair. You have no... You have no idea. You know what I do know, Beth? I know that I've received your blood tests, and right now, your inflammation levels are... are 20 times the level of the average person, which could cause many problems, including a potential stroke. And right now is the time where we need to focus more than ever on you and your health and your wellness so we can attempt to bring this inflammation down. You're not here with me. You're not going through this. You don't know what it feels like. You know, you... you have your life. You get to have your life with your family and your house and your garden that you planted. And like... When am I gonna have that? You're telling me I have to be, like, completely well before I even think about something like that? No, I'm not saying not at all. I'm saying right now, your focus just has to be on you, for you, about you. I don't want to live there. I can't live there, so... Not facing... yourself head on, I believe at this time and this state of your diagnosis is the thing that is... holding us back. Well, you know, you scare me when you say that I could just at any moment stroke out or fucking keel over from a heart attack. Do you know how much that scares me when you say shit like that? It does, it is scary. That's why I can't play... That's why we can't play these games. That's why we can't... we can't afford to spend time or energy or focus on anything else because it is scary, Beth. The virus has mutated and is even more deadly than previously assumed. They advise continuing to shelter in place until conditions improve. The president today said that he is withholding federal aid to the Democrat or blue led states of California, Oregon, and Washington during this violent fire season, that so far has claimed the lives of dozens and the homes of hundreds. Beth, I had a thought. If talking to those chairs in therapy isn't working for you, try something else. A letter maybe, an email, maybe even a video. Do what works for you. Hey, Mom and Dad. Just saying hi. I'm supposed to talk to you. I'm trying to talk to you. I don't know... I don't really know what I'm doing. You would probably think this is crazy, huh? I mean, I think it's crazy. I miss you. It really sucks that you both died. Right back to back. Couldn't stagger it for me? No, it's all right. Okay, good talk. H... My God, are you okay? - I'm fine. - Are you okay? - No, I'm fine. - Get a drink. Do you want to get something to drink? No, I just... No, I have a something in my throat, I'm fine. Oh, hi. - Hi. - Hi! Hi, how are you? No, I just have a Lyme cough sometimes. It's like a dry cough. It came at a really bad moment. Wow, uh, that's a... that's a hell of an entrance you made. Hi. God, you look beautiful. Well, you look very sexy. You look really hot. You look super... You're, um... - In my sweater? - Yeah. - That where I was going. - Sexual. I was going for the, uh, sexy fisherman. Have you been looking at my Pornhub account? You know my type? - Ooh... - Is that it? Is that what comes up in your queue, - sexy fishermen? - Sexy fishermen. I'm a little nervous, I'm a little... I'm nervous too. I feel like I'm kind of sweating already and I...- Sorry, I shouldn't have even have said that. No that's okay, human sweat. I'm sweating. Yeah, well, I mean, I would imagine it's hot there. Yeah, it is, and I'm wearing Spanx. Well, I, um... I... I got you flowers. Oh, my gosh. - That is so... - Yeah. Wow. Geez. That is like really... I wish you could smell them. They, uh... They smell pretty good. I... I don't... I don't know what... I don't know what the other shit is. Well, I like that shit. I wanted to make this night perfect. And I... I thought, you know, uh... if I was seeing you face to face, I would... I would give you flowers, um... 'cause you deserve them. Yeah. Here... Here you go. Thank you. What was your dream job when you were a kid? Probably this. Exactly this. Looking at you. I wish I could kiss you right now. Yeah? I just wish I could... Oh... I wish I was right there with you and I was just able to give you a kiss. I don't know, here I am saying I want to kiss you, I don't even... I don't really know your... your last name. And I'm asking for a kiss. What is your last name? Do you have a middle name? Um... Wh... Why... Why do you want to know my last name? Oh, I... I don't. I mean, I was just... I was saying just because I asked... I asked to kiss you. I said... You know, I don't even... It's kind of weird. You know, you feel like if you... if you were on a date and you were leading up to that moment of kissing, that you would, I don't know, at that point, you probably would've known each other's names. - And I just... - Yeah. Just thought it was interesting that I don't know your last name. You're trying to like... Like, are you... You want to take my identity or, like, find out all my passwords or... - Because, um... - No. There's a lot of, you know, there's a lot of scams. There's a lot of scams out there and... and I have been very open and honest with you. - You know my entire life story. - A scam? No, I... You know my entire life story. What... What do you... I've taken you around my apartment, you know pretty much where I live. I took you in the shower with me. You've seen my body. You know things about me. And now I'm afraid that maybe we've just been doing this a little too much, a little too fast. Look, I'm not some... some kind of creep, I just... I just find it, um... It's not a scam. - I just didn't know your... - I want to believe that, I really want to believe that, but now I'm afraid because, you know, I... I came... You know, I even told you last night because I'm an idiot. I'm so fucking stupid. I told you, last night... What are you talking about? I got inheritance from my parents when they died. It wasn't much but you know, I just openly gave you that information - and, and you want my money. - I just wanted to know your... I just asked your name. I didn't... I didn't say I even wanted to know it, I just said I don't know your name. And I... I put... I put myself out there, I just... Where are you right now? You... Look, you've seen my entire apartment. I've... I've shown you everything. You're just in front of this blue wall. Where are you? Are you, like, in the... a basement or are you in prison? Oh, do you... do you have a wife? Is that what this is? Are you hiding? Are you cheating from your wife? You got kids upstairs. Is this just some, like, little project for you? I'm just, like, some stupid girl across the country that you can chat with and feel good about yourself. Look, I can't... I can't do this. I can't do this and I'm sorry. I'm sorry, did not mean anything by it. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Don't go, don't go. - I'm sorry. - Please don't go! Please don't go. Fuck. Why do you always do this? Why do you always do this? Fuck, fuck, fuck. Why do you always gotta be like her? Such a fucking idiot. Hi. Hi. I am so sorry. I am so, so, so, so, so sorry. I did not... I did not mean to do that the way that it came out and I... I know... I know you're a good guy and I'm just... I'm just a paranoid loser - that doesn't understand. - Stop, stop, stop, just stop. Just stop, please, please, please just stop. You're right. I haven't been honest. I'm sorry. I... I... I just... I just... I just... I need to say... I just need... I need to say... I need to say it. I need to... I need to... I need to tell you who I am. I just need to be honest. - Okay. - I just need you to listen. I just... I just need you to listen to me. Can you do that for me? Can you... Can you please just listen to me? - Please? - Yeah. Yeah, I'll listen. My name is Eddie. I live in Rhode Island. I live with my mother. I've battled alcoholism... many years. My wife... she left me two years ago... because of a car accident. And now I'm in a wheelchair. I'm embarrassed. I'm 40 years old and I live here with my mother. Things... Things aren't as bad as one would think. You know, I mean, we actually have a pretty good relationship, but for two years, I really had no connection with anyone. I tried to make better choices, I tried. But I drank. I drank a lot. I made bad choices. I lost control, we hit a curb and that was it. I was... I woke... I woke up... I woke up in the hospital a few days later. I had no use of my legs. They said my wife survived... but I never saw her again. You have to understand, this... this connection, I... I haven't felt like this in a long time. But when I saw you... When I saw you... and you picked up that phone, it was something there that pulled me in. You were in need, I was in need. It felt right, it feels so right. It feels right. I don't want anything from you. I don't want anything. No... No money, no social security numbers, nothing like that. I want a friend. I want more than a friend, I want that connection. But I understand that I... That I haven't been honest. I'm a product of my own problems, my own vices. I'm two years sober. I'm clearheaded. - Okay. - But I'm disabled. I have nothing but this... this is room and this chair and a mother who... who loves me unconditionally. You... You have given me... hope. Beth, see... I'm sorry that I brought this on you. And... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. My... My n... My name... is, um, Beth May Connell. I want to touch you. I want to touch you so bad. I can't wait. I can't wait till the end of this pandemic. I can't wait. We shouldn't have to wait. What if... what if there was a way I could be there with you? - How? - In your dreams. I would like that. You promise? I promise that I'll see you in your dreams. Goodnight. Goodnight, Eddie. Okay, okay, okay, so you have to understand, like, he literally, like, in the dream, it was like his face. He went... went down, okay? He went way down, all right? - Oh, yeah. - And I don't usually like that. Like, I don't usually... I mean, it's been, like, years. Like I don't... I am not usually a fan of that, but oh... Oh, my God. I have never in my life, I have never had an orgasm with a guy. You know this. You know this. - I know, I know. - I've come close. I feel like I usually just fake it until, you know, so it can just be over. It was like... He had like a magic... He stayed down there for, like, 90 minutes. It was like a... a Geyser is what it was. Okay, does this person actually have a job or does he just, you know, I don't know. - Um... - He's a clam digger all the time. I don't understand. Clam digger he is. Thank you for that dated reference. Um... I'm gay, I don't do the vagina thing so... - It's okay. - It's a clam, right? It's a clam. Let me preface this by saying... - You have an answer. - Yes, I have an answer, - but it's not an answer... - You're stalling- That you are going to approve of. So I need you to know... I need you to be kind, because this is... this is a little bit sensitive, all right? And I care about this person. I like this person. - He's a good person. - Uh-huh. He lives in Rhode Island in his mother's basement. - Shut the fuck up. - Because he's a recovering alcoholic. And he got into a car crash because of the alcohol and almost killed himself and his wife. His wife survived, he survived, but he is paralyzed now. What part is paralyzed, just, his face? No, his, like, he can't walk. He's in a wheelchair, but it's like from the waist down so... yeah. Does his dick work? I mean, I think it works but he... but he can't feel it. - Oh, God, Beth... - So... - I know. - Don't do this. Don't do this. - I know, I know. - Don't do this. You need to end it now. You've only known him for five minutes. It needs to... No, come on, come on, come on, no, no. I like him, I like him. I know, I know on paper... Of course you do, of course you do. It doesn't sound good on paper. He's a special brand of fixer-upper, and, uh, that's very on brand for you. - Thank you. - So I'm gonna need you to just like completely cut ties with this guy. - No! - Oh, my God. You have a tendency to build things up in your mind and it ne-heh-ever works out that way. But maybe that's time it will. You need to find someone stable. That's what I'm saying. - I mean, I think he's stable... - I don't think that... - What's this guy's name? - Eddie. Eddie. Fisherman Eddie. I mean, I don't even really know if he was a fisherman. He just mentioned it. And he has that accent, you know? So it's like... He sounds like a fi... It doesn't matter. Fishermen Eddie in his mom's basement in his wheelchair is really gonna give you the stability you need. What is so wrong with talking to a nice man who listens to me and likes talking to me back? He like... He likes my personality. He likes the way I look. He compliments me all the time. I don't know. What's so wrong with that? I don't want to see you do this again. I guess I don't see what's wrong in indulging in a little bit of fantasy when the world is fucking ending. It's a fantasy. - It's a... - I'm just saying that we're not kids anymore and you have to start thinking about your future. Anyway, it doesn't matter. And I don't care that he doesn't have any money, and I don't care that he lives with his mother. I don't care that he doesn't have full use of his body. - I don't care. - Well, I don't... I'm not saying that you shouldn't be with someone because they don't have full use of their body. It's just, with you it's just one more thing... - Is what I'm saying. - I know. I know. Yeah, it's like you usually date broken men, and this time you've really outdone yourself. I just want you to be happy that I had, like, a gushing female ejaculation experience for the first time in my life. - Wash your sheets. - Okay. - All right. - Aye, aye! So explain to me again what really, like, what these... these stretches do or like what, what's the... Oh, okay. I gotta ask you. I... I just, I... I can't... I can't control it. I... I can't hide it anymore. So I just gotta ask you, uh... Did you enjoy last night? - Uh... - Last night, in your dreams? Did you enjoy last night? Um... Because I got to tell you, I enjoyed it so much. Did you enjoy the way I used my mouth? And it was like fireworks. Come on, I know you... you... You were a screamer. You were a screamer and I gotta tell you, I mean... I gotta be honest. It got... It got... It got a little messy, but I'm okay with that. Oh, my God! Oh, my God. - Um... what? - I want to do it again. - Mm-hm. - And I just wanna... - Yeah. - I just want to make you feel good. Oh, my God. - Okay. - I promised you I was going to see you last night. And I kept my promise. It sounds pretty fucking crazy, but it... it was real. And I made it happen. You need to... You need to explain what is happening right now, because, um, if you were in my bed last night, that's a little hard for me to... I don't really understand the mechanics of that. Have you ever heard of astral projection? No. Astral projection is an intentional out of body experience. Sometimes, when we sleep, our consciousness leaves our body to go live in a rich dream world on its own, detaching from the body. Ancient civilizations have been documenting this for thousands of centuries. You know those dreams that you wake up from and you could swear that there was something hauntingly real about them? It not only found like a fully formed idea, but... but a fully formed world. That feeling of falling you get sometimes right before you drift off happens totally by accident. That is what astral projection is. Only instead of waiting for it to happen by chance in a random dream, we can control it. We can manifest the places we want to go to and leave our bodies down below. So our consciousness can travel through the spiritual planes. I know this sounds absolutely crazy, but you have to believe me. I think we can do it together, Beth. Last night, I concentrated really hard on what your room looks like. The dimensions, what you might feel like, your soft skin. I set an intention to make it to you... and somehow it worked. I was in your room. I've never done this with another person before. Beth, we can get you there too. In the astral, we're free. I can dance with you. I can feel things. You'd be free of disease, move without pain. I visited your dream because you gave me permission to, but if you try to astral project yourself and actually meet me there, you would be able to participate with me. You wouldn't be half asleep and just waiting for things to happen. You would be able to control them with me. I use the rope method. You lie flat on your back and you visualize a rope suspended from the ceiling. It comes down, and you pull yourself out of your body. Now, your mind has to be clear. Focus on where you want to go, what and who you want to see. You'll feel vibration. You take that rope when it's offered, and you climb out. I found astral projection in my darkest hour, I was ready to check out, honestly. I was close. When I discovered this... That was not a magic carpet ride. I realized that we were so much more than our physical composition. We could run, fly... make love. God... Beth. We are simply souls floating by the sea of night in the ether and we have the ability to become more compassionate and perceptive to the worlds and the people that surround us. Life is just a story that we tell ourselves, right? I want you to feel what I feel. To have agency over your body. It doesn't always work so well sometimes. Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad. I can't sleep. Nothing new there, huh? I met someone, a man. And I love him, and, uh... I guess that's why I'm trying to talk to you guys now, like I'm supposed to. I'm supposed to talk to you guys, I'm supposed to talk about these things, hash these things out. and, uh... Did you know? Did you know? 'Cause I think you knew. I think that deep down somewhere in there, you knew. You knew... what was happening with the next door neighbor. I think you knew. And you sent me like a lamb to the slaughter. Did you know? Did you know? Did you know? So... I get to Rhode Island and I find you there... and you are... waiting for me. Yeah. And I get up close... and I let you kiss me... and I kiss you back. Yeah. And then... I'm gonna get up on top of you, okay? - Uh-huh. - And I'm gonna wrap my legs around you in your chair, and then I'm gonna move in, and then... I... But I have to... I... I just, um... I feel like I'm being dishonest with you. Um... I haven't really figured out how to tell you this. This is not the right time, clearly, but, um, I have to just say this. Um... I was raped by my... by my neighbor, by my next door neighbor, um, when I was 11 until I was about 15. And, um... But... But I thought that... I kind of thought we were in a relationship at the time. I thought he was my boyfriend, but he was an adult. And it's like... There was nobody there. No one gave a shit, I don't know. I... I didn't realize that I wasn't in control of it. And so then I just kind of stopped doing anything altogether. And now I just kinda don't know what the fuck I'm doing. And I don't know... I don't know how to feel good. And I don't know how to make you feel good. And I don't know how to... I don't know... I just don't know how to do this emotional sexual intimacy. I get... I get it, I get it. You... You don't have to go any further. I, uh... Beth, um... First off, I'm sor... I'm sorry that you had to experience that. Fuck! That's fucked. Uh, and thank you for your honesty. I know that that's... I can't imagine that that's easy to... to have lived with up until this point and to even sit here and... and tell... tell somebody. - So... - It's just not sexy. It's like we're trying to do all these sexy things and I'm just... I'm in my head, and I can't stop thinking about it and I... It makes sense, it makes sense. I mean, it makes sense that you would be in your head Fuck. I mean, something that traumatic. I get it, I get it. And I... I... I appreciate you, you know, trying to go there with me, but I don't... I don't want... I just... I want you to be comfortable with me and to be y... to be real. Be that... that person that is comfortable with with yourself and just... Fuck. If it's just... If this is what we have, if it's just talking with each other, that's... It's fine. I'll see you in the astral. I don't know, man, I mean, yeah, you can come visit me in the astral and that's wonderful for me. I mean, Jesus, that's done more for me than I think you'll ever really understand, um, but I can't participate with you. I'm not... I can't get there myself, and I don't think I ever will be able to. We keep trying, and I keep falling off my bed and freaking out, and I can't... I can't do it. I don't know if I'm ever gonna be able to do it. Listen, it's all right, it's all right. We... We will get you there. You will get there, Beth, I promise. I just... I'm sad a lot and this is just really, um... It's bumming me out, I guess, a little bit. Well, if it's any consolation, I don't have a fucking clue what I'm doing. But you look like it. Look at you. You're like a sex god, you're just... I just want to eat you up. Stop it. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Stop calling me. Beth? What? Beth, oh, God. Beth I've been trying you. I've been trying to call you, and I haven't heard from you. Are you there? Are you okay? We've missed several appointments. Oh, shit! Um... yes, I'm good. Um, I'm sorry, I meant to hang up. I didn't mean to pick up, um, I'm sleepy. What's going on? How long have you had that cough Beth? Will you just, like, calm down please? Your energy is just, like, it's like... - Ugh, it's so hot in here. - What are those? - Are th- - What? What are those lesions on your neck and chest? Beth. - What do you... - Are those Bartonella rashes that I'm seeing on the camera? Um... no, I don't think they're Bart... um... They look like lesions, Beth. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, no. It's not a rash. Oh my God, Dr. Kensington, this is not a rush. Do you see this? This is proof. They're hickey's. They're hickeys! - Oh, my God! - Is someone there with you? Yeah, well, sometimes, sometimes. You remember my... my boyfriend, my boyfriend, the guy, Eddie? So we started doing this astral projection and I wasn't able to do it for like the longest time. And I didn't think I was gonna be able to do it because I've been so traumatized and apparently, I can't meditate, but apparently... apparently I'm over it because we... we had sex last night. We had sex. We had sex in the astral. We astral planed, we projected. We projected to a plane above ours. It was amazing! I could move. I could move my entire body. I was moving back and forth, I was... My hips were doing things I didn't even think it was possible to do. I just... I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I know this sounds really crazy... - Beth... - But I love him so much! Please, I need you to listen to me very carefully. As your doctor, as a medical professional, and as you're my friend... You're my friend? I want you to listen to me. I think that it's time that we consider some other alternatives, including bringing in a psychiatrist. I need you to understand how dangerous a position that you're in right now. You should be happy. I'm getting laid, finally! I thought that you had died. It is... It is... It is shocking to me that you would throw away our progress. You know me, Beth. You know... Well, you know what we've been together and how we've worked together to fight this terrible disease. And right now this disease is overtaking your body and overtaking her mind, and I think we need to change our treatment plan, okay? - I'm listening. - You're not being yourself. - And I think the best thing for us... - No, I am being myself. - Is to make a pivot... - No, no... - And look at some other psychiatric options--This is who I am. Dr. Kensington, you don't understand. I'm not some good girl. I'm not some studious, open the book, do what I'm told. I'm finally alive and I am gonna follow that. I'm gonna follow that. I know it sounds crazy. I don't even care, I don't care, I don't care. I'm not going to some fucking mental institution. I'm not gonna go to... And you know what? I love you, I love you, you're so pretty, and you're so good at your job, and I just love everything about you. That's not what I need from you, I... But I think our time... I think our time is past. - I think that we're over... - No, no, no. I have to go. I need you to listen to me. - I have to go, bye. - I need you to trust me. Goodbye, goodbye! Yes! Ha, ha! There's a house on a street - by the sea. - By the sea. With faded blue shingles, weathered to gray. It's lights burning bright, - but never for me. - But never for me. - Ready to be wowed? - You're gonna show me... Yeah. - Watch! - Wow. Whoever wins the fourth card gets all those cards. Fuck! Shit! What was your father like? He was a good man. He was Canadian. He always told me growing up, if things got real bad here, I should claim my birthright up north. If things get worse, I might have to. You want to come with me to Canada at the end of the world? I'll be there. Do you ever get scared? You know, the virus? Yeah. All the time. It doesn't stop. I want... deep dish. You know? You ever had deep dish? How deep? I got you. - Are you kidding me? - Oh! Ooh! I gotta you! That's what I mean when you can't... You can't fuck with this. Fuckin' won it all. Fuckin' queen of the cards. Boom! What was your mother like? Bury your brightness, my shiny sweet pea. I can't talk about my mother. Would you like to see my boob? How about that? When you were a kid, did you think it would be like this? I thought it'd be worse. We're so far away from each other, Beth. Why don't we just stay up here a little while longer? I love you. It's your long lost friend. The same friend that missed going to the Tony Awards Live because you broke your fucking ankle. Remember that? Wasn't that fun? Maybe you can call me back now. Okay. Hey Beth, I know that we're not seeing each other anymore, but this is a friendly reminder to do your exercises today. Take care of yourself, Beth. It works if you work it. I saw this woman with really big sunglasses today and it made me think of the time that you stabbed yourself in the eye. That was such a good time. Um... But call me back and we can talk about it. Hey, Eddie. Oh, my God, last night. Anyway, I... I tried to video call you today and you weren't online and all of my texts are saying they're not delivered. I guess I'm a little bit worried. Give me a call back. I love you. Bye. Eddie. Eddie. Pick up. Please pick up. Okay, okay, okay. Ow, ow, ow. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hey, Eddie. It's me, um, just checking in. I, um... I fell and I hurt myself pretty bad, and, uh, I guess I'm a little freaked out. I've never lost time like that and, um... I don't know, maybe it's time I start, uh, listening to my doctor. Maybe it's time I actually start doing this work. Um... so I guess I just wanted to say hi, and, uh... just let you know that I'm, uh... I'm... I'm doing better, I'm feeling better, I'm feeling stronger and, um... I really miss you, and, uh... if this is... if this is it, I... I don't know what happened. I don't know... I don't know what's going on with you, but, uh, if this is it, I just want you to know that I love you a lot, and I'm really grateful to have met you. Turn that heat up to make a personal sauna, to sweat your toxins out. It's easy and you can do it at home. Did you know that your skin is your biggest organ? If you're feeling sluggish or if you just want to boost your immune system in these frightening times we're living in, you need to sweat out all the things that bog you down. It's time to detox, girl. You'll be so glad you did. Hi. Hi, where... where were you? I was so worried. You're... Oh, God. What's wrong? What happened? My mother's dead. She died. I've been drinking. Oh. They came over in these... these hazmat suits. Fucking hazmat suits. They came over, and they told me I had to go into another room. They... They plastic off, you know, all plastic all over all the doors and the kitchen. And then I wasn't able to... I couldn't even see them take her out. They put her in a bag and they took her and they told me, unfortunately, they have to burn the body because of this virus and that they can't risk it. They can't put... They can't put her in a place where this... That they were gonna cremate her. That's it. It's just fuckin' burn her up. I can't... I can't even have a fucking funeral. They're gonna burn her up. That's what they told on me. It's not like we got family or anything. I mean, it was just... It was just her and I. I know it's really fucked up right now, and I don't know, really know what to say that isn't gonna... sound like some kind of... manufactured Hallmark greeting. I just need... I need for you to feel it because I know that that's what the drinking was. You were... You were trying not to feel. That's... something I think that's pretty natural to feel, you don't want to feel this. It's the most horrible feeling in the world. But I want to thank you for reaching out to me. Um, and I don't want you to feel ashamed, but I do need for you to feel it. And you can feel it. You can feel it here with me. I'm gonna feel it right along with you. And you do have something to live for. All right? And... you can't disappear like that again on me, all right? - I promise. - You can't do that. I was so ashamed, I... But you don't have to be ashamed. Can you come here? Can... Can you... Can you come here to Rhode Island? Can you... Can you be here with me? I... I need you. Can you get here physically, can you come to me? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I... I can't, um... I can't fly, uh, that'd be too dangerous for me, um... Yeah, no, no, no you can't. But... But... But I can drive, I can drive. I mean, I could... I could leave tonight. I will literally pack a bag right now and I will come. - You can drive here? - Yes, I can dr... - You can come? - Yes, yes, I've done it before. I used to live on the East Coast. I've done this drive. I know what it's... I know what it takes and I know the fastest routes. I could literally leave in the next hour. I have the map, I have GPS. I have a full tank of gas and I have money. I can get there to you. Okay? Let's do this. It's been long enough and this is an emergency. Wait, wait, Beth, Beth, Beth. The borders are shut. No, they're not. What do you mean? The borders, the borders, the borders to here are shut. - How do you... - They're patrolling the borders, I... I... They can't do that. That can't be true. That's not American. What? Are you serious? I can't... I can't get... I can't get out of here. I couldn't even... I couldn't come see you, even if I could get out of here. I couldn't... I couldn't see you because the bor... - I'll drive past it. - I couldn't get to California. I'll get a ticket. They can arrest me. I'm gonna wear a fucking mask. I'm gonna wear gloves. I'm gonna wear a face shield and I will bust past it. They can't stop me. What are they gonna do? Are they gonna arrest me? - Eddie? - I don't know, I don't... I don't know. I mean, if it's the National Guard, if it's... I mean, what are they... I don't know. They're keeping people out. Could they fire on you? I don't know. I can't risk... I can't risk that. I can't... Fuck! I can't risk that. I can't risk you coming here and having... It wouldn't be safe for you to travel alone, Having to go through borders to get here, if every border is shut down. You can't come down here. So what are we gonna do then, though? 'Cause... Then what? I... What are... Just wait it out? Just keep waiting it out? I can't... Okay, that's what we'll do. If that's what we have to do, that's what we have to do. We'll wait it out, then, we'll wait it out. It won't... They can't keep the borders shut that long. They... They can't, they can't. They can't do that. This won't last. I just want to get out of here. I want to get out of here. I don't want to be here anymore. Okay. I just want to get out, I want to go. I want to get away. I gotta get out. I mean, we need a fresh start, right? We need, we need to... A fresh start, yeah, where the air is clean, somewhere away from... away from cities and all this... Somewhere remote, somewhere where we could... where we could just be you and me and we... - I gotta get out. - Okay. I gotta get out of here. We'll... We'll do it, we will. We just have to wait a little while longer. But it won't be that long, I promise. I will be there, I promise. I just don't know when. I just need you here, Beth. I need you with me. I just want to be with you. I just... I just... I want to get away from this. And I want to be with you. I just want to get out of here. Just please, just hold on a little while longer, all right? We're gonna do this. I don't know how, but we're gonna do this. Okay, so, um... what do you... what do you think about, uh... Everybody deserves a funeral. Grow safe in the dark. Let feelings fly free. Where lights once burned bright, but never for me. At the house... on the street by the sea. What about some of the stretches? Have you... Have you been able to sorta move a little? Just little stretches, like little... just stretch your deltoids and your... I know it's not... It's the blood flow. Yeah, honestly, just... just moving a little bit every day makes such a difference for your head. I mean, honestly, I... I used to not be one of those people, but I... but I kind of get it a little bit better now. Just sort of, you know, just stretching and just... I don't know, I just want you to keep your circulation up. We just gotta keep moving, we just have to keep... I know, I know it hurts. I'm sure everything hurts. I wish I was there. Will you meet me in the astral? Um... I need... I need an escape from this right now. I... I need... I need... - And it's been a while. - Yeah. I could really use some time. Time to not... not really be in my head down here. Of course I will, um... - I'll do that. - You will? Yeah, no, I want to, I... I really... I want to. It's been a long time and I just want to see you smile again. So I just... Yeah, I'll meet you there. So where do you want to go? Beth? Where are you? Beth? Can you here me? I'm here. Can't you see me? You have to wake up now. It's no good here. Please. Beth, open your eyes now. Please, Beth, open your eyes. Beth? Beth, where are you? Beth? Come on, snap out of it, Beth? Beth, come back to me, I'm right here. Follow my voice too get out. I'm right here. What was that? What was that? What? What? Talk to me, talk to me. What... What... What were you talking about? What was that? - Are you okay? - No. I was in... I saw... I saw... - What is it? - I was seeing things, I was seeing some really bad things. There were... there were people... there were people, they were shouting, there were shadows. And it was... it was... it was... it was... it was just darkness. And there was blood and I couldn't breathe. And there was blood in my throat and I was throwing it up. I don't know where you were. I could hear you, but you weren't there. I couldn't find you. I couldn't find where you were. I mean... Oh, God, Beth, you're safe, you're safe, you're here, you're here. I was injured and I was... there was... there was so much blood but then I got back - and it was okay, and... - I saw them. I said I saw them too. What's happening? I was afraid of this. I thought we had pushed past it. I was... Pushed past what, Eddie? There... There... There are risks. I thought that this was just some fun meditation stuff. I'm really confused and I'm really scared. I didn't... I thought we were okay. I thought we were okay. Our mind... Our mind wants our body back. I don't want to live in this fantasy anymore. Okay? I feel like it's the end of the world. Hey, Mom. I remember. Now. I remember you choking me. I remember not being able to breathe, feeling like my body was on fire. I remember you telling me how much you hated grandma 'cause she would dump all of your breast milk. I even went to live with her for a while. I was too young, I don't... I don't really remember all the details, but I do remember that. Why would... Why would someone dump breast milk? It's 'cause you were drinking, 'cause you... you didn't know how to cope. I know that you smoked with me when you were pregnant and you drank with me, and you needed it for your nerves. I know that 'cause nobody ever helped you, 'cause your dad hit you... 'cause you were raped. 'Cause you lost people that you cared about. And I think that you carry that around with you. And I think that you wanted a baby so bad because you wanted pure love, and you got that but I was sick. I was just a sick kid. And I think that that was probably really overwhelming for you. And I think that with all the trauma that you endured, and I think that with all... all the abuse, the genetic predisposition for depression, anxiety, all these things, I think you were mentally ill. I think there was a diagnosis in there, but nobody... They let you down, Mom. And then you lost your mind and you died. And that's not fair. And I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Mom. But I just need to say it, that I do remember. I remember now and I think that you had postpartum depression. You just didn't know how to cope with... With me. And so you hurt me. You hurt me before dad hurt me. Before anybody else hurt me. Before I became just a magnet... for dysfunction. And tragedy. And I look at my life and I just think... God, so much wasted time... hurting, feeling like this. And then I think back, and God, this is how you must've felt your entire fucking life. And it's unbearable. I don't know how you did it. I know you did the best that you could. And I know that you stored that trauma and that dysfunction in your body... and then you gave it to me. And you probably got it from your folks, and then their folks and then their folks. And I've just been giving it to myself. But I don't want to do that anymore. I need to be done with this. I'm really sorry that all of that happened to you. And I know that you loved me. I know that. I loved you too, I still love you, Mom. And I just want you to know... that it's okay. It's okay now. You're safe now. But I'm done with this. Okay. Okay. Firefighters are being flown in from various other states today to help combat the ever-growing Vincent Fire, now spread to many parts of Central and Northern California. The Governor has declared a state of emergency. In breaking news, federal troops, the National Guard and secret police are being deployed into major cities across America, effective immediately. Military tanks have been deployed and reports state that local law enforcement is cooperating with the commanders... ...who now have total and absolute control. What does this mean for the American people? The military can arrest civilians for no stated reason, thus suspending habeas corpus. Civil liberties such as the right to free speech and protection from unreasonable search and seizure is suspended. The speaker says this... Hi. Oh, my God. I've been trying to get a hold of you. I don't know if you've seen the news. This is absolutely fucking crazy. Hi. Hi. Why do you... You look like you are sick. No. You look like you have a fever. You look... you look feverish. I got a little bit of a fever, all right? I'm not gonna lie to you. I'm just sweating a little, that's all. It's humid here. So it's okay. Yeah, it's... it's... it's... it's okay. Are you sure that you... actually want to be with me? I'll need help with things, it's not always going to be... you know, romantic. I know... I know it hurts and I know that it's hard. It's... It's... it's hard to breathe, but it says... it says that if you can just kind of, like, lean forward and... and just kind of, like, hit your... like, I think it means that, you know, if I were there, I would do it. It's like, if... you kind of got to, like, pound on your chest a little bit just to kind of like loosen up the mucus because it's... it's just settling and you can't move and you have to move, but I know you can't move. I get moody. It can get dark, and I don't want you to see that. There's a house on a street by the sea. Hi. Hi.
