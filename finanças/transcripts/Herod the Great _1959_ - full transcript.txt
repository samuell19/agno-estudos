Hear Ye!, men and women of Jerusalem! Here the sentence of the grand Sanhedrin, which has judged guilty of blasphemy and rebellion Amir, son of Zachary. And Zochar, son of Eli. Herod!, our great sovereign by the will of god, King of Judea has just and deserved punishments for their crimes, orders that they shall be hanged upon stakes until they shall both be dead!. Orders that they shall be exposed for two days... -Let me through... ...My son... Mother... Move on!. -My son is innocent, you must believe me... ...Have pity... Water... I'll get you some my son... Will you let me take this?, please. -Yes. Give him this water for pity's sake. -There's no pity for those who've offended our king!. -Herod has murdered that man because he called Herod a murderer!. Return to your work now... Where are the others?, who won the battle?. -Where are our sons?. Dead, imprisoned or on the run. Aaron, what news?. -Not now. I am the commander of the stronghold, I demand an answer!. And I am the commander of the king's royal guard, I answer only to the king!. Defeat or victory?. -Aaron's face does not speak of victory. Well then, is it the end of Herod?. -Silence!. We must be ready... for anything. My King... I understand, Aaron... Defeat. With how many men have you returned?. A mere handful of your royal guard. And my Idumean cavalry?. My mercenaries?. And the Thracians, the Arabs?. They were wiped out. And my ships?. All sunk. Off Actium. But I swear to you they fought valorously and bravely. And they would surely have held out longer if Antony's men had not given in and taken to flight. Antony was doomed from the moment he met Cleopatra. My King, she was the only one who was faithful to him to the end. The end... -He had no other choice but suicide. Who loses, must pay... And I have lost with the others. Listen to my people Lift your voices in thanks to God!, to him who has not abandoned us!. Listen to them. They can do nothing else but curse and pray!. They are all wild dogs. Lunatic rebels, exalted and deceived!. They will soon feel the fist of Rome!. But while I live, they will all know that Herod is their King. While you live, did you say?. No one will ever see me in chains Aaron. I alone will decide the time, and the manner of my own end. There is only one thing that makes life worth living, to fight for something and for someone. -For what?, is not my kingdom in ruins?. And for whom... ...I am alone. Go Aaron. -My King... Go... Farewell, My King. Orders of the King. No one may enter his chamber. But I can see my father. -No. No one may see him. My father has not asked for me?. -No. I see... He asked for that woman and her son. You're here, alive!. Sarah, you must warn the Queen at once. Only she can save him, run to her and tell her to go to the King immediately. It's a matter of life or death. Hurry!. Well?. -They were the usual marketplace scribes Miriam. -No brother, they were different voices. Something must have happened. -My Queen!. Aaron ordered me to come to you, it's a question of life or death for the King!. Mother, what has happened to my husband?. -It's the end of him Miriam. Antony has been defeated. -God's mercy!. Miriam!... don't go to him!. My Queen, Aaron said that nobody was to pass. -Open. What are you doing here!?. I have come... -To say goodbye!?. Because my place is at your side. Thank you, Miriam. But now I must be alone. And soon, before nightfall, you will be alone. There will be great rejoicing, and prayers of thanksgiving. The whole city is waiting. Do you think that I do not know it?!. They are all out there, in the corridors, the streets, the squares. Waiting... All asking one another, is he still alive?. -Don't talk like that. It is not the first time that fate is against you. You must fight, fight back!. Why are you saying this?. Because I love you. Three years ago, when you forced me to be your wife, I hated you. Your power frightened me. But then your love lit mine so much, that I don't know which flame burns more. Your heart is good I know it. It's other peoples hate that made you who you are. Do not leave me. You must live!. But if you have decided, take me with you!. If only I could believe you... -You must. If I could... -You could!. Then they would not triumph over me. Let's flee together. To the desert, the mountains, where no Roman soldier will ever find us. Miriam, it will be as King or not at all!. You were born a Queen, and you shall remain so. This Octavian is not destiny, he is not a man. -What will you do?. I will live!. Oh, it's you is it. -Shame on you, always looking at yourself. Wait a moment. Why do you always hurry away?. I don't want my mother to see us talking together, she doesn't like you. Does she comb your hair like a girl?, it's disgusting. I'm going now. -If you think you're King it's too soon. I don't understand. Your mother would. You're always playing games with words. What is it you really want?. -I want to know. Tell me if this is clear enough for you: Herod is finished. Either he'll commit suicide or they'll kill him. But... you're speaking of your own father. -He's always despised me. Perhaps because my mother was not noble like your sister. So, I ask myself what will happen to Antipater when the new King shall be Daniel. Have you already decided my fate?. With your wickedness... -Wickedness?. It's my skin Daniel, my skin... Trumpets!. -What does it mean?. Today, is a day of mourning. The army has been defeated. Many men will not return to their homes. We exalt their valour. They have fought for their King. The war has been lost. And it is my duty to think of the welfare of my people... with different means from the arms which we no longer have. And it is for this reason that I have decided to go to Rhodes. To pay homage... to the new master of the world, the victorious Octavian. I see among you many anxious faces, and the concern you must have. But nobody speaks, where are my counsellors. Sameas. You who were proclaimed the interpreter of the law. You were summoned here... today were you not?. Why do you ask me?, generally you prefer to listen only to your astrologers. Nabutzar!. What do your planets say today?. Do they speak ill for me?. I am sorry my great King, but it is so. You should not go. I will not listen to predictions. Ezra!. A ceremony will be held today at sunset for my safe journey. And thus every day until I return, do you understand?. Yes my King. Aaron, we leave at sunrise. Choose the escort. Depend upon me. Taris. My King?. -The troops will be drawn up for my... departure, and the square will be filled with cheering crowds!. You shall be obeyed. Miriam... and Taris. During my absence, see to it that the snakes among us stay in their dens. Or... when I return, I will change the colour of this room to red!. This won't be a pleasant journey Olem. That's the reason I asked the honour of being a part of the King's escort. Very well. You will go with us. Till tomorrow. -I thank you Aaron. What is it Sarah?. -You've just come home and now you're leaving again. You make me the most unhappy wife in all the world. Herod needs me at his side. And you know I owe him everything. If it weren't for him I would still be a petty chief in the desert of Dumea. My father met his death beside Herod in a battle against the Arabs. The King willed that I should go up in the palace as one of his family. I too owe him everything. But how can I ever forget that my own father was killed because of the King!?. He was a soldier!. -And you too are a soldier. And I fear that Herod, will tear you from me too. Dear Sarah, that will never happen. When I think of tomorrow... -Don't think of it. Now I have you in my arms... Smile at me. How lovely you are. My love... Why do you look so troubled?. I have been looking at you, and, it seems to me that you were surrounded by other men and they were asking you ''Is it possible that you could have loved such a monster?''. And you said let's not speak of him anymore. What are you saying?. It was as though I had ceased to exist. Life still went on. You were still living. And you said to them.. ''I never loved him''. ''It is finished now, I want to live to forget him''. Only a moment ago, I was lying in your arms. Did you feel my heart?. Did you feel the way it was beating?. Do you think it was lying to you?. Perhaps you were thinking, I must sweeten the last hours of this man. Every thought of yours is poisoned by suspicion, but you must trust me, I'm... your wife. -You are so beautiful, the most powerful men in the world would throw their kingdoms at your feet. What a magnificent prize you will be for the victor. They will forgive... ...you that you were Herod's wife... Other men will hold you in their arms. Is your faith in me, so miserable?. -Your blood is young. It will want to live and will revolt at the thought of a dead man. You must not say such things. You told me that you have hopes, and I also have hopes. You told me that you will come back and I know you will. Nothing can cast this thought from my mind. Is your anxiety then so little?. -My confidence is so great. God will not part us. -Then if I ask you,... will you promise me, that if I should... It is time. We must leave eachother. -What do you want me to do?... ...Ask me. Ask me. Nothing my love, nothing. It was madness. But if there is no madness, there is no love. Taris, what does this mean?. They have shut themselves up in their houses. To get them out will require a massacre. If you order me to... -Perhaps I will!. When I return. Now we do not have the time. May the Lord go with you my King. May the Lord prevent your return. You have never come into this room before. You are wrong. I used to live here once. When my family reigned over Judea. It was our family. -I often wonder if you remember the... blood you bare, everyone does. The family of heroes, that's how we're known to... the people. Because through the centuries we have dedicated our lives to them... And now this chosen people of the Lord must bare the domination of a proconsul of pagan Rome. -No proconsul will ever dominate our land. Don't you think that Herod will return then?. Or at least, that he has made secret agreements with Octavian?. He's always been a master of double dealing, hasn't he?. As far as double dealing goes mother, I know someone else who is also a master. I was filled with joy when I saw you here, I needed a word of comfort... But you just came to make me suffer. What is it that binds you to that Idumean barbarian then?. Your marriage... to him was an insult to our name. He has humiliated you, he's contaminated you, You ought to hate him!. It's not love... It's nothing but the senses. He has bound you to him, you fill me with disgust, my daughter!. -You cannot admit that I love him. And you also cannot admit that I love the son that he gave to me. Look at him. Since he came into this world you never came to see him!. For you he is Herod's child, that is his fault. He has a face that is so sweet. So tiny, and fragile. Like all other children,... but to you he is Herod's child!. If Daniel were King the people would be spared the shame of a Roman proconsul. I've come to you to know if you would be opposed to the project. I am only awaiting his return. What a sad thing that mother and daughter, should be so divided. Go no further!, the Romans are killing everybody!. My King, what do you intend to do now?. I shall go on as I have planned, to Rhodes. You Aaron, will return to the palace. My King, allow me to go with you. I know that you are loyal and brave, and it is for this reason that I have... chosen you, for a task. -As you order. Aaron if I shall not return from Rhodes... -My King... If I said... I should not return... I do not want to be alone, after my death. I want her to be with me. She whom I love. She who you love... -Swear that you will obey me!. I swear it. I want you to go back to the palace, and stay by her, and protect her. While I live. But if the news should arrive... -Yes my King?. She must not even suspect my order. Do you understand?. I understand. Did he give you a message for me?. -He ordered me to stay close to you, and to protect you. Depriving himself of his most valiant and loyal man, it's strange. How was he when you left him?. Despairing?. Herod knows how to confront best in me. I would love to have his strength. I wonder when he will come back. By now he should nearing the island of Rhodes. Answer me Aaron, and be sincere. What do you think will happen at Rhodes?. Do you think he will return?. -He will return. I wish it as much as you. If any news arrives, advise me at once. Rest assured that I will my Queen. -You may go now Aaron, you must be very... tired. Why do you think he has returned?. Herod has sent us his strong right arm. His keen and watchful eye, his very shadow. Like Herod, Aaron is Idumean. A race which has brought misfortune to our land. Let us hope it will bring misfortune to Aaron also. And so Cleopatra... Queen of Egypt... Took her own life, by causing an asp to bite her. The gods, venerable fathers of us all, have will that she shall not follow in chains, I... Commander Claudius!... Hail Octavian. On the coast of Africa near Actium Herod has been taken... prisoner with some one hundred armed men. Where were they headed?. -Here. If it's true as they say that... Herod is a madman, this is certain proof of it. He has asked to see you, he wishes to speak to you. He probably wishes to beg for clemency. I cannot be clement with a man who has deployed his mercenaries on the side... of the traitor Antony. -What shall we do with him then?. Bring him before me. I want to know him, I shall measure the pride of one who calls himself..Herod the Great. Be careful of him Octavian. Herod is very clever at the use of the treacherous weapon of deceit. He's very shrude. I have crushed other serpents, surely more poisonous than he. You will wait before concluding my message to the senate. Perhaps we may... also add that my triumphal chariot in Rome will be followed in chains by the King of Judea... Herod the Great. Who saw you enter?. -Only my servant. Continue. -He was chained as I have told you, as soon as he dismounted from his horse. Then he was dragged in the dust like... a slave who has been condemned to death. The commander then ordered him to... be lashed. The people covered him with spittle and insults. Well, and then?. I thought it best not to stay long since the soldiers of our King's escort... had already been taken prisoner. You will soon hear confirmation of the execution of Herod. The news has already arrived Olem. -How?. You have brought it. -I?. Would you like to become commander of the guards?. Do as I tell you and you will. I will obey you my Queen. And after he was bound with heavy chains he was dragged into the presence of... Octavian. But he was already a corpse when he got there from the numerous... wounds he had received from the soldiers and the rabble along the way. I myself saw a Roman centurion plunge his sword into his back. Then, he is dead. Herod's body was devoured by dogs outside the city wall. If the Romans find our country torn by disorders they will impose the... proconsul upon us. We must avoid this absolutely, Or it will mean the end of our independence. That must never come to pass, let Daniel be the new King. Agreed. But let us not forget there are still many who are faithful to our tyrant. People bound to him by blood and self-interest. They will be our enemies. We must strike them down before they can act!. I am with you. Daniel as King, is just. My father was a monster. I will tell it to the people. I will tell it to them before all of you!. No one could do it better than I can. You can trust me. I am with you. I am with you!. Answer me!. What are we to do with him?. He'll get what he deserves. He is not dangerous. Aaron is dangerous. He must be eliminated. I approve. Tonight. It's your concern. You are his friend. Aaron save me!. The soldiers have completely surrounded the palace,... there's no way for me to escape. -What's the matter with you?. There's no hope for me. My father is dead. What!?. Yes!. -You are lying... You are lying!. No!, they want to kill me too!. I saw it in their faces, they've condemned me... to death just because I am his son. -Who came back with this news!?. I don't want to die Aaron!, I want to live!. You must help me!. Olem. Is it true?. Is Herod dead?. -Yes. I must speak with you... I wanted to go and kneel before Octavian and entreat him to deliver me the... remains of the King, for an honorable entombment in Jerusalem. But I feared for my own life!. I confess it... By disguising myself in these clothes I was able to escape. To die like that. A great King. So great that even destiny itself seemed to be subject to him. How much he would have regretted not falling in battle. We served him faithfully to the very end. I must serve him even beyond the end. What did you say?. He gave me an order. Have you gone mad!?. Have pity!. Have pity!. -Pity!?. You, my closest friend. Why!?. They ordered me.. to do it. Aaron, what's happened?. He was my friend. And he tried to murder me. The palace is in great turmoil. Is it true what they say about the King?. It's true. Go back to your chamber. -And you?. There is something I have to do. Listen to me Aaron. There will be a new King, new factions will command in... the palace. Don't set yourself against them. Go back to your chamber I told you!. And don't leave it again. Take the baby. Any news?. Yes my Queen. Dead!?. I should have stopped him!. He shouldn't have gone!. It's all my fault!. I can't live without him!. Aaron, I employ you. Kill me... Kill me.. do as I tell you. Kill me!. I cannot. It is what he himself ordered me to do, but I cannot. He!?. I have always obeyed my King. When he has wished it I have killed for him with these very hands. But now, you no. You must go on living!. This is what he wanted?. What has been cannot be changed. Now you must find new strength. Think only of the present and the future. Of the future?. -Yes, for your son. It is for him that... you must live. To see him grown up and sitting upon the throne of his father. One day you are sure to be proud of him. Now you must think of the life of... your son!. -What are you saying?. There are vultures on the point of breaking out of the palace. There... will be plenty of bloodshed and your son will be sacrificed for reasons of state! Does this not move you!?. -My baby!. Who?!, my mother?. It is she who is behind the plotting. And even if she did try to save him... others would prevent her. Forget about Herod, and about yourself.. If you... really love your baby. Idiot. Aaron was quicker than he was. Now he'll arouse his guards. -Aaron and all his guard have fled... from the palace with the Queen. I would have preferred to see Aaron in his place. Here is Herod, the Great. Why are his eyes shut?. -Seven days in the dark Octavian. Bring him here. Seven days in the dark, you can stand, you can sleep. But without water... Do you want water?. I want to talk to you. What do you hope to obtain?. You are now my prisoner. If you had captured me Octavian, then I should expect to be killed. But I... came here of my own free will. Do you think that will soften your fate?. -Yes, because I have the right. The vanquished have no rights!. But a King, who comes himself to the enemy camp, and presents himself to the victor, has to be listened to. Not out of generosity, but for your own good. Do you think Octavian should learn the arts of war from you!?. No... Victorious Octavian, but the politics and life of these oriental countries,... especially where my Judea is concerned, you will find that it is not like... other countries. You're astute and ready with your words Herod. But Rome has no interest in speeches. It is interested in faithful allies in... those regions where its frontiers are threatened. In Judea, cunning and experience serve better. These were my weapons. Who will collect your taxes?. No one has been able to collect them from that people, except Herod. Why then seek a new man when you already have one, who can be useful to you. If you replace me, you will have to send many legions which you need elsewhere. Must I forget that you put your entire forces in the field against me!?. That you were faithful to Antony to the very end!?. Yes!, I was faithful. And this from a Roman is the greatest tribute you could pay me.. Do not think of whom I was a friend. Think of how I was a friend, and I will be the same to you too. -Your friendship shifts easily from... vanquished to victor like a chariot in the circus racing from one turning... post to the other. You're very astute Herod. But if you try your shrewdness against the forces of justice, it will have no effect upon me!. As your arms had no effect upon Rome. Take this man away!. Well executed Gaius Octavian, he will stand as an example to the other petty sovereigns who think of rebelling against Rome, along the coast of Asia. I haven't decided what is to be his fate. Whether he will follow in chains my triumph in Rome, or remain on this coast as a perennial warning of our strength, and greatness. He deserves only one fate. Death!. Let us leave it to the Gods to enlighten us. I give no consideration to my personal sympathies Claudius... But only to the future of the empire. Galan is back!. What news do you bring from Jerusalem? -They're preparing for Daniel's coronation How long will it take to unite all tribes?. It won't be possible until the next full moon, many are... We must convene. Send messengers to Idumea, tell them to announce signals that can contact those farthest away. We'll leave tonight, I'll come with you. The Queen!. My Queen, we must attack Jerusalem. The crown belongs to you and your son. I don't wish to fight my mother and brother. You are our Queen, we need your orders, not requests. As long as we have an army, no one will terrorize you. Thus are the rules of war, defeat or be defeated. It is much better to entrust your destiny with arms rather than the compassion of others. It is up to you. Godspeed. Allow me to come with you. -No, you must return to Jerusalem... We need you there. -I don't want to leave you again. We cannot only think about ourselves Sarah. Yes, you're right. -Farewell, and take care. For the moment they're preoccupied with the others... ...But they'll soon come for me. They know I haven't left the palace, they'll find me and kill me. -I hope not. If they learn of the fact that I've hidden you here, I shall be killed as well. It's a great shame your father is no longer here, while he was with us things weren't that bad. Now I'll have to return to my country. Who could it be?. They've come for me!. Who is it?. It's me, Mohab. He's only a slave. -Mohab?... I don't trust him, he may have betrayed us. There are soldiers everywhere, if you leave here now you'll likely be killed. Maybe he can leave tonight. -Probably, the entire city is rejoicing and there will be great confusion. I can't take it anymore... ...They'll find me. -Have faith, the stars shine bright for you. I know your stars well. If your father had believed in them, he would still be alive. It is written: I have cried to the Lord for a long time,.. And he has listened to my cry. And he has drawn me out of the quagmire of despond and placed my feet upon the firm rock. Daniel!. Remember these words, And may your reign be as a rock, for the glory of the Lord and of Israel, may you be an example of virtue. To the end that the mire which covers this throne through the guilt of an impious King, shall be washed away. Look!. The Romans! The Romans are here!. Here!?. -Yes, marching towards the palace. Go on with the coronation. Hurry, you must act quickly. Ezra, accompany him to the throne. Place the crown upon his head. Proclaim him the new King of Judea!. For the glory of the Lord of Israel... What's going on, a feast perhaps?. Claudius, you will find many strange things about this country. They do not perform on the stage as they do in Rome and Greece, here they recite their parts in palaces!. And the characters are not played by actors, they are real. An ambitious Queen mother!, a traitor general. I was faithful to you my King, as long as I believed you were alive. And all are gathered here, to perform a comedy. A crowning ceremony. What did you say?!. The sad news of your death.. came to our ears.. as a grievous thing for us all my King. Where is the Queen!?. Where is Aaron!?. You thought that I was dead!?. -Yes my King, Olem brought back this terrible news to us. By order of Octavian Augustus, Emperor of the Romans, Herod is King of Judea. To him, the people and all of you here owe absolute obedience. Father!, oh father you're alive!. -Yes, yes, I have returned. I had to hide myself, it's as much a miracle that I am alive as it is you've come back. -Tell me, where is the Queen?. Kill them father, avenge yourself!. -Where!... Answer me, where is she, where's Aaron?. -I asked for his help but he refused it, he only thought of protecting her!. -I'm asking you, where is the Queen. What has happened to my wife!?. -She's fled. Fled!?. -With him. Then she is safe. Where did she head?. -Ask Sarah. Father!, kill them father!. Kill them!. My King. Where is Aaron?. Well answer me woman, you must know. I know. -Is the Queen with him?, is she safe?. Yes. Come then, show me where they are. Only now do I feel alive... Now that I hold you in my arms... Smell your perfume... Nothing else exists now. The expectation of death... The distance.. Longing for you... And the terror that I might have lost you. This moment makes up for everything. Speak to me. -You're here. You've come back, I thank God. -Oh no, it was not your God who saved Herod, he saved himself!. Why do you look at me like this?. Something has changed. Changed?. -In you. If you had loved me, how could you have thought.. decided, how could you have ordered.. Where is Aaron?. -Gathering together the men who are still faithful to you. Because Herod is thought dead. And so that his son may be able to reign. Do you not ask me why?, why he did not do it?... I don't know.. I only know that I could not order someone to go and kill the one person I loved. Do you not understand Miriam?. Do you not understand what my love is for you?. When you were ill two years ago you almost died, I was determined then that if your illness should take you from me.. that I would not continue without you, without you.. there would be nothing. Is it so strange then that I should demand the same from you?. But you did not demand it!. In stead you put an assassin at my side, and it was only through his mercy, that you did not find my grave on your return. Did you even think of your son?, Aaron did!. Aaron!... Not only did he reveal what he should have kept to himself but now he has made you my enemy!. -Enemy?, me?. Oh Miriam!, forget my madness!... I have returned to you,.. and you have not even given me a smile. Ah!, what a joy it is to be home again Claudius!,... among my people. I know that you are homesick for your Rome, but we will do our best to make your stay with us a pleasant one, to make this evening unforgettable. Friends!, let us show our guest from Rome that peace, joy and happiness reign in Herod's palace. You will find Claudius, that my people are retiscent to show their emotions, when they are overcome with joy. Wine!. Let us drink to the new peace of Rome!. The peace of Rome who has eliminated their enemies,... To Claudius Severus!, a strong wine, which can overcome the dryness of stones. And now, for some of my other favourite wines,... To Alessandra, the pride of Israel. The noble representative of a most noble blood. I do not drink as you know. -But for once, you must drink. And for my friends, the wines that they most deserve. Taris, a rock of unshakable faithfulness. For you, the same.. And Sameas. For you a wine that is cool and limpid, like wisdom. And if you should find it somewhat bitter, then blame my wisdom. For there is always something bitter in it. What is the matter, are you ill?. Herod.. -I said drink!. Toast the health of your King!. Are you all afraid to drink my wine?. Your fear has given you away.. My King!, little prince Daniel, there, in the pool!. Is he dead?. Yes. No!, he can't be dead!.. Open your eyes! Listen to me!.. Speak to me!. How unfortunate.. You murderer!. I can understand your sorrow Alessandra. -Abomination!. I knew it!, I felt it!... It was you who had him killed!. You!. He did not know how to swim!, he must have fallen in while playing. Be quiet!.. I despise you!. How dare you!, he is the King!. -Let her be!. She is his mother,.. Unfortunate Daniel.. You had your whole life before you, you could have aspired to great things. Your blood gave you the right. I wish that he be buried as a King!. With full honours, exactly as would have been given to Herod. If Herod... ...had died. Don't touch him!. -Mother.. You're not my daughter!, you are not Daniel's sister!. You are only the woman of that murderer!, you are his accomplice!. Mother what are you saying!?. -Don't try to win me with false tears!,.. revenge your brother!, you must kill him and free us from that monster!. My son!.. My dear son!... I implore you, give me an answer to this! -The King does not answer to anyone!. The King no, but my husband yes. Say only a word, a single word to take this terrible thought from my mind. Say it was an accident!. -I already said that it was!. Look at me!. Tell me again, now!. Answer me this question Miriam,.. Which is the dearer to you, your brother's life or mine!?. Supposing you had... to choose... -Nobody can demand such a choice!. Very well then let us suppose that the brother intended to kill the husband!, what then!?. -This is your answer then!, you had... him killed!. -Listen to what I am saying!. Let us suppose.. A King who is surrounded by enemies, reads in everyone's eyes lies, hatred, treachery.. His throne and his life are in danger, and in the middle of this rising tide a brother... The Queen's brother... This King what should he do?. Should he not forestall his enemies and strike first!. You revenged yourself on a poor young boy!. As a Queen and as a wife you should have replied that was has been done could not have been avoided!. -I hated those who hated you!, the... courtiers betraying you, the Pharisees inciting the people, and even those who came by night and soiled the palace walls with insults!. I even made an enemy of my mother!, for you!. Because... Because I loved you. There is room for weakness in this world. One must strike first, or be destroyed. Perhaps your enemies are no better than you. Perhaps they don't have the right to hate you. But I don't have the right to love you. Something is dead in me now, you killed it. No, you must not talk like this.. You do not know what you are saying. It is because of what has happened that now you say things that you do not mean. Later you will understand... Miriam... It was said that Daniel looked like me. That he had my face, and my eyes. Do you still want to embrace me?. -Do not speak of him anymore!. Leave me!, let me go!. But I need you. -Herod needs nobody. Then go!. Join my enemies!. -The only real enemy you have is... you yourself!. What are you doing here?. I heard you... And you dare to admit it!?. -Is it strange I should give thought to my father?., That I should worry if his honour is betrayed?... And suffer, when I realize that though he's strong with others, he's a weakling before his wife. -Get out of here!. How true it is that every man shapes his ruin with his own hands. Antipater... You are twisted and malicious. If you something to say then say it or go. Have you no trust in me?. -Not much, but go on. You would only consider it malice, I would gain nothing but your anger. Just speak!. When they thought you were dead they wanted to crown another King. Maybe your wife when she thought you were dead.. -What?. Yes, it could be.. I'll break your neck!... How dare you insinuate such a thing!. Tell me the truth or I'll break you in two!. Let me go!.. You're right!, I take back everything I said!. Who is the man?!. Who is he!?. The man?... Just think about it for a moment. Who is there here in the palace who is young enough, who's aspect is vigorous, and slightly vulgar as women like. Do you want his name?. You already know father. Aaron!. -You said it. The most faithful... -They're always the ones. What else do you know?. -That they were together, they escaped together and they lived together both day and night. If you observe well, there's something between them.. Like a communion of thoughts. -I want facts!. You ask too much. In their intimate moments naturally I was not there. If you have lied to me... It's much more dangerous to tell you the truth. At night I was finally able to sleep a little, it was so wonderful... I dreamed of my Daniel. Do you recall how he was as a baby with his long hair hanging down on his... shoulders?... The baby has just waked up my Queen. Don't cry mother, please. Sarah!, what has happened to you!?. Aaron has disappeared, and they've appointed a new commander of the royal guard.. I'm afraid my Queen!, I'm afraid!. -You should inquire of the new commander. I have asked him but he wouldn't answer me. Nobody will tell me anything, you must help me my Queen. Only you can ask the King where he is. I cannot. But it's a question of Aaron's life!, if he has fallen into disgrace.. you know what will happen to him. -In disgrace?. But it's impossible... He was Herod's best friend. They are the ones that tyrants strike down first!. Forgive my boldness, but I can't stand it anymore I'm going mad!. He is everything to me!. Don't cry Sarah, I will help you. Wait for me. Mother please, take care of the baby. Your orders have been faithfully executed my King. Aaron and the commander Circa have been put in chains. Don't tell me, tell the hangmen. Ah, you could not have come at a better moment. Allow me to present to you our new commander of the guards, the valorous and faithful Ephraim. -My sword and my life are dedicated to... your cause. Well spoken Ephraim. The Queen appreciates your.. good intentions. You may go now. I did not think that I should see you again after all the days and nights you have kept away from me. -What have you done with your best friend?. My best friend?, everyone here is a friend. -You understood me very well, I am speaking about Aaron. Oh.. Aaron. For some time now you have avoided me as if I were some plague, and now at last I see you again. Why is it I wonder?. Could it be perhaps that you are curious to know what has happened to Aaron?. But you are frail, you are shaking. Why are you afraid?... For him?... Could it be that you are afraid something has happened to him?. What have you done to him?!. You want to see him?... Very well then.. Come with me. Where are you taking me?. -Be patient!. Now you can look at him!. Why are you wasting time?. -The man has fainted my King. Let him know that we are here. -Vinegar!. Look at me!. Do you recognize me!?. Herod. -Your King!. No... Not any.. longer. You were ambitious, my little Idumean. Gathering together the desert tribes, for what!?. To steal the throne for her perhaps!?, and for yourself!. No doubt you thought in your miserable little mind, 'why not be daring aswell?'. 'Did not Herod meet with success in the same venture?, and his courage and... his greatness have in me too!'. What a pathetic and pale imitation. A jackal!,... disguised as a lion. Look at yourself then and tell me who's King!. Aaron... I can let you die quickly,... or I can keep you alive so that you may curse the woman that brought you into this world. It depends on how you answer this question... How long has all this been going on between you?. When did it start!?. Torture him again!. No!. -When did it start?!. How long have you two made Herod your fool?. Continue!. -My King, this way he will die. I said continue!. -No!, have mercy!. I want the truth!. -None of it's true!, none of it!. Swear it to me!. -I swear it!. Then prove it!. -What can I do?!. Kill him yourself and I will believe you!. -But he's innocent!. He will be buried with full honours!. -But this is terrible!. His life for our love!, that is what I demand!. It is the only proof you can give me!, the only proof that I will believe!. Ah!.. Because you love him!, ahh.. Take her away!. Again!, the vinegar!. Is it possible.. that he has always truly been like this. He's always been possessed of the devil. Only you would never believe it. He was not always like this, when we married, he wasn't like this. My poor Sarah... If I knew by confessing Aaron would be safe, I would have confessed what I never committed, even in my thoughts. -I can't bear it any more!, there must be some way. Flight. -What are you saying?, is it possible?. Do you know?. Tell me I implore you. In the next change of the guard there will be men we can trust. The only faith of the guards, is their fear of the master. Why should they risk their lives for Aarons?. Not for Aaron, nor me, nor you. But for something that is worth the risk, gold. He's right, men will always sell themselves for gold. We must at least try. Only as I've already told you my Queen, the recompense must be equal to the risk. I unfortunately possess nothing, my father hardly allows me enough to clothe me. You my Queen are rich with treasures, that necklace alone. I don't know what's in your thoughts,... but I know I must try to save Aaron. Have faith in me, I promise Aaron will be saved, and I will keep my word. You may go now Sarah. My beloved. -Sarah. Now you'll be free again, they're going to carry you out of here and place here the body of Samir's. -Is he dead?. Yes, tortured to death. We must hurry!. Come, I'll help you. Give me the reward you promised me now!. Here it is, it's worth much more than what you deserve. It's all done as you wished my Lord. -And the guard?. He has been payed. -You did not mention my name?. Oh no!. -I know that I can trust you, you may go. Sleep my baby,... Sleep. I don't want to see you anymore, go away. Forgive me, for what I have done to you... I have struck you, marked you.. Forgive me. I cannot sleep.. I.. cannot rest. I have been thinking of many things, of you, of my son... My son... -You're mad!, what are you thinking!?. What shall I do... Aaron did not confess. He will die before a single word will pass his lips against you. And you say nothing?,... You hold within your hands my peace of mind and you do not want to speak?. You do not want to listen!. I rule a mob of slaves but it is I who am the slave, yes, your slave if you want it. Is it not possible again, that you feel as I feel?. After all our happiness?. Again?... All that's happened seems so far away. It seems as if.. it happened to other people... Not to you and me. -But it was to you and me!. And it could still be so again if you want it. I will forgive everything!, if you are willing to be with me again. I will forget all that you have done!. -I pray God to enlighten you. I am not speaking of Gods!, I am speaking of ourselves, you must humble yourself. Ask my forgiveness,... and then we will start afresh, our love, ..everything. You have insulted me like a courtesan, and now you want to treat me like one. I ask you for the last time. No!, never!. Aah, get out of my sight!. -I know you don't want to listen to... me father, but Aaron has escaped. -What!?. He's no longer in prison. What are you talking about!?. Someone must have bribed his guards. Who has bribed them?. -Come with me father. You sent for me to come to you, what is it Miriam?. It's horrible!, I have married a monster!, and now God is punishing me!, what can... I do mother!?. -Calm yourself my daughter calm yourself. Sit down here and tell me all that has happened. The child, my baby. I'm frightened, he looked at him in such a strange way, and... he was saying strange words, as if he doubted that it was his child. Do you... realize what that means?. If he thinks that it is not his, he might even kill him!. Yes, he is capable of it. -You must help me!. Take the baby, leave the palace and Jerusalem, and go where nobody can find you, save the baby!. -Very well... My poor daughter. Who gave you this?. Speak up man!, it is the King who questioned you!. Mohab, the old household slave. When I discovered it was Mohab he tried to kill me, I had to kill him in self defense. Get rid of him. -To the executioner!. Have pity!, pity!. I gave her this,... when I returned from Egypt. It's all clear. Yes, all is clear now. Tomorrow night we will be at my home my Queen, in Bethlehem. Go and tell me if you see someone coming. Remember, he must live like all other children, it's the only way for him to... be safe. -No one will know he's the son of the King. Take good care of him, he is so sweet and so delicate. I know very well what it means to have children. If God wishes, after this storm has passed, I will let you know. May the Lord protect you my child. -Wait!... who knows if I will ever see him again. -The guards my Queen!, they're coming here!. One guard, stay here at the door. You two, come with me. Orders of the great and noble King Herod, from this moment on you are a prisoner, you may not leave these chambers for any reason and no one may visit you. Tomorrow at the third hour you'll be conducted before the grand Sanhedrin, in order to be judged. Constituting the high priests of Sanhedrin, only a complete and humble admission of guilt will inspire clemency. Your majesty the Queen, you are now before your judges. You are my judges, yes, but you are also being judged. Do you not recognize the legitimacy of this tribunal?. I recognize a more important judgment. -This is your judgment!. I can barely see you, and your voices sound weak to me. God is my only judge, he knows that cowardice and falsehood may help me to survive, but the life I would live would be despicable. You are accused of adultery. -I am before you because of my fidelity. Do you admit aiding the prisoners escape?. I admit. He was your companion in sin, do you admit?. You must answer, did you commit sin with him?. No. -Why then did you help him escape?. He was imprisoned unjustly, just as I am before you unjustly. To escape justice is to contempt justice. Justice,.. innocent, and he was still killed. 'Thou shalt not kill', said the Lord to Moses. -'Thou shalt not commit adultery' said the Lord to Moses, but I see you have neglected that commandment woman. You sent for me father?. -Well, what is happening?. The judges know they must render justice to you. But why are they taking so long?. -The woman is clever, she talks well. Well go back then and tell them to hurry this business!. Slave!, slave!. -My King. Look out there up in the sky!, tell me what do you see.. Tell me!. A miracle. Nabutzar!. Great King. What does it mean, this sign?!. According to my science or according to the superstition of the Judeans?. It is to you that I put this question!. Nabutzar you know very well that tonight will be decided the fate of the woman who has been my wife!. This celestial sign is a warning perhaps!. Or an omen!,.. Answer me!. Great King it is truly a sign of justice. An admonition to your enemies, an... announcement of glory for you. Even if the false prophets pretend that this... comet you see in the sky signifies the coming of the messiah, the new King of Judea. My fortunes are reflected in the heavens. I need not have feared otherwise, now all the people of Israel will see and... understand that the stars protect Herod. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Did she admit to her guilt?. -No my King. She did not confess?. Then,... then she did not ask for mercy?. Not for herself, but for those who are passing judgment upon her. She had no word then?,... for the man she had offended. Nothing?. For the King she had betrayed!. What is your judgment?. Ezra the judgment!. The great Sanhedrin has found the Queen guilty of adultery as accused. She did not ask for mercy?. It is not human... She will show her hatred of me, till the end. Father, you must decide the punishment. She is an adulteress!,... the law shall be upheld!. She shall be stoned to death. She shall be,... stoned to death. Tomorrow at sunset?. What did you say?. -I asked you if the execution is to... take place tomorrow at sunset. Yes. One day I will sit upon this throne, and reign over the people of Israel. Sarah, it's terrible. Herod has condemned the Queen to death. She is to be stoned today at sunset. Move your arm a little, that's right. Does it hurt?. Not much. You have nursed me well,... do you have any news of the Queen?. I've heard nothing. -Then I must go and... No, not yet!. Do you love her Aaron?. Destiny and inexorably mingled our lives. -Answer me do you love her?. No,... It isn't love as you understand it Sarah,... Everything that could ever pertain to the nobility of a woman, she possesses. The purity, the grace, the gentleness. One look from her is enough, and one of her smiles to recompense any man for the greatest sacrifices. Herod does not deserve her, he has been unjust. That is why I feel it my duty to defend her, and to save her. Sarah, what is it?. I'll have to tell you then.. No one can save the Queen now, no one. Why not?!. Today.. at sunset.. she's to be stoned. No!,... and you knew about this?!. I was jealous!, I didn't want you to risk your life trying to save her!. You mustn't go!. I love you I couldn't bear to lose you!. Detestable tyrant!, so he has even gone to this vileness!, I won't allow him... to commit such an infamous act!. -He's a giant Aaron he will crush you!. An eye for an eye!, that's what he taught me!. Aaron don't leave me!. -Let me go!.. Let me go!. Don't leave me alone Aaron!... Each of you will take command of his own men, the condemned woman will be... conducted from her cell, across the square to the wall outside the Eastern gate. It's the King's order. In the square, there will be many people. Many!, and outside the wall there'll... be still more. I require of you that there are to be no incidents, everything must be carried out to perfection. Taris. Has she asked for me?. No my King. Taris if she should do so,... if she should confess.. If she begs for mercy,... even at the last minute,... you understand you... -Yes. In that case I will suspend... the execution. -Yes you must, you must stop the execution. Promise me Taris,... that you will stay with her. Promise me. I will my King. Go then. Father a man has just been arrested, you are spreading rebellion among the people,... telling a fantastic tale about a miracle, that the messiah has been born and a... new King shall reign Judea. A new King?. Fetch him here. He claims that he has seen it. What is this you have supposed to have seen?. Well?. Him. We were grazing our flock near Bethlehem, I and my sons. Suddenly as night had started to fall, a great star in the heavens illumined... the valley, where there was an old stable. My sons became frightened, but I seeing the great multitude who was going in that direction said, 'Let us go too.' As we drew near the place, I saw upon the faces of those who had arrived before... us.. How shall I say it,... It was peace. It was joy, and in my heart I felt that same peace that same... joy.. I looked into the stable, and I saw a man, and a woman. And then under straw, a little one who had just been born. And kneeling before him, three Kings dressed in robes alike I had never seen. Three Kings were adoring the newly born babe. I looked at my sons, who knelt... down, then I knelt down too. I knew that I had begun weeping, the people all about me were saying, 'It... is he, it is the messiah!, the new King of Judea!, hallelujah!'. Enough!. Ephraim... Take your men, go to this Bethlehem, and kill all the newborn, all of them!. It shall be done. If you will confess your guilt, you will be saved. You must decide. People of Jerusalem, you must carry out the sentence, it is the law!. The Sanhedrin has condemned her as an adulteress. Carry out the sentence!. Is she dead?. -Herod has committed his most atrocious... crime. Where is the Queen?. I wish to see her, where is she?. -At the old wall, don't go!, you won't... recognize her. Miriam... No!, no light!. -Father!, what's the matter?!. She was innocent... Now I know it. Now that she is dead. I thought that she was no longer mine.. She was innocent and now she has punished me.. Miriam!... Father!,... Antipater... You knew she was innocent!. -No!. Yes!.. You knew it!. -No father!. It is you who has done all this!, you serpent!. It is you who has killed her!. -I only acted for your sake!, for your... honour against those who hated you!.. No father!. You did it!. -No!. You jackal!. Why did you do it!?. Die!. Die!, you jackal!. Miriam!. My son!. Where is my son?, my little one. Where is he?. Slaves!. The King's calling you!. Answer me!. Where is Miriam?!. Who are you!?. You dare to take my place!?, answer me!. Who are you?, the messiah?. Guards!, take him away!, put him in chains!. Take him to the stake!,.. I am King!,.. I.. Herod!, the King of the Jews!. Blood!. Who has put blood on my throne!?. Who?!... Blood... Everywhere!. Blood!.. everywhere!.. Help me Miriam!.. save me!.. There must be a place in the world, for love, rather than hate.
