The 24th of August, 1936. Angel Beach, California. USA. The world, the universe. Angel Beach. Happy birthday, Daisy Clover. I'm 15 today but I won't let it go to my head. I'm still the same happy, adjusted, polite, young lady. People say I'm quite sophisticated for my age. That's only skin deep. Underneath the veneer... I'll bet my simple, healthy instincts against yours any day. Look, Mrs. Clover, were there any distinguishing marks? I never heard of a distinguishin' mark. It's anything special about a person like a scar or a missing tooth. Where you been? You had your breakfast? - Yeah. - This your daughter? Well, it's not my mother. Mr. Clover never lost a tooth. Your mother called us to report the sad news about your father. Does Mr. Clover often fail to come home? It's too long ago to remember. I haven't seen him in seven years. You waited seven years to report your husband's disappearance? I only started to miss him this morning. Human nature. Photographs never did him justice but he looked exactly like this. Okay, Mrs. Clover, you've had your fun. Yeah. Well, I certainly have not. He's got a button missing. Hey, how long has your mother been like this? - Like what? - Like that. The dealer's been a little moody since Mr. Clover took a powder, that's all. - The dealer? - The old chap. I call her the dealer 'cause she plays a lotta cards. Well, that's no way to live. Ah, live and let live. What do you do for money? Mr. Clover left us some government bonds. And some gold cufflinks by mistake. What was your father's profession? - He invented things. - What things? Oh, like musical earrings, you know? Got the idea from cowbells. That one never caught on. I'd better figure out what kind of report to make. Hey, wait. Listen, take my advice and drop the whole thing. It's no good askin' Daisy questions. She doesn't remember as well as I do. The cards are givin' me nothin' but trouble this mornin'. Hey, old chap? After all this time, you really want that old joker back? Maybe I do, maybe I don't. It's none of his business. Some people got no imagination! Yeah. Milton! - Hey! - You stinking sneak! You stinking sneak! How's business? Like to buy me out? My folks get back from Hawaii tomorrow! You said that yesterday. I forgot about the time belt. Hey, you gotta come down to the store and see that Victorian brass bedstead we got. It's fantastic. I can see it when your folks get back. - You said that yesterday. - Daisy, dear. When can I expect my Myrna Loy? - Oh, she just came in. - Oh. Milton, why don't you keep busy in the summer vacation like I do? Get your mind off of it. I helped my father move furniture around the store for a whole month. But it didn't take my mind off of it. Nothing takes my mind off of it. Here she is. You know, even our handwriting's the same. - Thanks, Daisy. - Okay. "I Got It Bad and That Ain't Good." Daisy... Oh! You sing? What's the matter with you? You wanna be a singer or somethin'? What's the matter with wanting to be a singer or something? Don't you wanna be anything? I'm gonna be kept by some rich older dame. It happens if you're good at it. Then get to work. - Ow! - Daisy. What are you doin' in there? I'm fryin' up fish burgers. I got beans and hot chocolate, too. It's my birthday and I want a party, damn it. Stay off those four letter words. There's too many of them around. Try and concentrate. It's my birthday. You take an awful lot for granted. Well, the 24th of August has always been my birthday. - That's your story. - You got a better one? I have never heard of such a thing. What? Your sister, Gloria oughta be ashamed of herself. If it's your birthday, she's forgot it. Well, I certainly intend to forget hers. Oh, the hell with Gloria's birthday! - It's my birthday. - Yeah, well... Come on, old chap. Pull yourself together, huh? Try to get in a party mood. We're gonna eat and cut up. We'll... we'll take a walk along the beach. We'll treat ourselves to a sweet sherry or two. Maybe we'll call up Gloria and give her the bird, okay? Hey, old chap? Hey! Your mother just drew the ace of spades. Her number may be up. I'll let you know. One. Two. Three. Four... five. - Close the door. - Huh? Close that door! Something is very wrong. There's a hearse outside. And I got an insulting telegram. Who from? Some smart aleck askin' me to present myself for an interview. I never give interviews. - Where's the telegram? - I threw it away. No point keepin' trash like that around. Daisy, I wish you'd send that hearse away. Hey! Hey, you! I'll be right out! Wait! Try and concentrate. I got somethin' to explain. I can sing. I open up my mouth and a song comes out. You oughta be in school. Try and concentrate. I got an appointment with Mr. Raymond Swan, see? They said in the newspapers that he was runnin' this talent contest. So, I recorded my voice, and I sent it to him. Who is this joker, some cop? No, it's got nothin' to do with the cops! It's Mr. Raymond Swan. It's the movies. Oh, I never go to them. That hearse is still outside. Go away. Go away! It's goin' away, old chap. With me in it! You shouldn't accept rides from strangers. They take you to a foreign country. They leave... Hi. I know, but I'm late. You never hear from 'em again. There oughta be a law against it. Wish me luck. I'm gonna make a noise in the world! Send me a postcard... if you get there. Follow me. What's your name? Daisy Clover. What do you want to see me about? I thought you wanted to see me. You sent me a telegram and a limousine. I sent you a record with my voice on it. Who taught you to sing? No one. You take your hand away from your face. All right, tell me why you sing. Why shouldn't I? Don't you know it's bad for ya? - Huh? - Oh, yes. Singers breathe out more air than they breathe in. Especially when they sing loud like you. They get too much carbon dioxide in their system. It makes them jittery, they start seeing things. I can't see anything. I didn't ask you that. I asked you why you sing. My mother says this world's a garbage dump. And we're just the flies it attracts. Maybe she's right. But when I sing, the smell doesn't seem so bad. Don't like your hair. I think she looks charming. Wonderful eyes. Ray, won't you turn off that horrible light? - This is my wife, miss, uh? - Clover. My name's Melora. Did you come here all by yourself? I call that very brave. Well, my mother's a little bit under the weather today. Tell me about the rest of your family. My father took a powder. So did my sister, Gloria. She went off and married some guy in real estate. Stand up for Mrs. Swan, please. Smile. Thank you, dear.

Everything smells of beans around here. Where can we go for coffee, hm? Brazil. Well, Miss Clover. I'd like to, uh, meet your mother. 'Kay. Daisy, send 'em all away. Do as your mother says. Sorry to have troubled you, Mrs. Clover. You can settle everything with Mrs. Goslett here. Settle what? You're a minor, you can't sign contracts. Sister's been asked to represent your interests. You kill me. All right, Miss Clover. You report to work next week. Mm-hm. Incredible as it may seem, I'm gonna make something out of you. - What? - Money. There's a certain mixture of orphan and clown that always packs 'em in. It's got a dirty face, heart of gold... and it sings. It doesn't smoke, or bite its fingernails, or cut its hair without permission. It becomes America's Little Valentine. And it goes to the top of the tree. Oh! Whoa! We're on fire! Oh! Help! Help! - Mother needs help. - No. Help. Help. - No, no, baby, you can't. - Let me go! - Mother was always... - Let me go! Daisy, you can't go in there. - No, no, no! - Let me go! No, baby, sister is “lust hacking out for you. Please. Ugh! Come on out of there, old chap! Come on out! Come out! Mother! Let me go! She may have fallen asleep! - She'll wake up, come on! - Come on out! Daisy? Hey, gettin' pretty hot in there, huh? They're ready for you now, Miss Clover. Come over here, Daisy. Sit down. Mrs. Goslett? Now, now, baby, y-you've gotta face facts. Our mother set fire to her own house. So she needs special attention in a special place. - Uh, right, Harry? - Right. I-I mean, a-a mother, who, well, plays cards all day just isn't seriously on the job. I-i-it's not that we think she's completely loco, kid. It's just that she'd be happier in an institution. Not an institution, a... - a special place. Mm? - Right. - You can't do it. - Well, it's been done. I read a magazine article. And it said as long as you can concentrate, your mind is still okay. Look, our mother can't concentrate. The dealer's no trouble! She can make coffee, she heats up beans, and she can read the newspaper headlines. Look, the law's on my side. And I've signed the papers. - You creep! - Look, I know... - Harry! Harry! - Rotten, stupid, garbage can! - Dirty rotten garbage! - Harry! Stop! Garbage can! Dirty garbage! Garbage! Garbage! Garbage! Now, now, now, now, there, dear. Now. Now, now, dear. Oh, dear. Now, now, now, now. Your sister's right, Daisy. She has absolutely full legal grounds for committing Mrs. Clover. You're going to be very famous very soon. Oh, you're gonna be news. People will wanna know everything about you. They'll shine bright lights in all your dark corners. Sometimes they'll praise, flatter you. Sometimes they'll be very cruel. That'll hurt. Now, think of the pain... if they tell about your mother. - And they will. They will. - And they will. - They will, unless we protect her. - They will, unless she's officially dead. It's all right, buttercup, you can come in now. Gloria is your legal guardian. You're coming to live with us, kid. Daisy... when I was 12, my father died, my mother went off to Europe and I had to live with some hateful cousins. Seemed like the end of the world, but I got over it. In just a few years, I had the rest of my life to do as I wanted. And plenty of money to do it with. Hm? So will you.

All right, Daisy. Once more, straight through. We hear the picture's great, you're a sensation. Come on, come on, "It's the most exciting moment of my..." It's the most exciting moment of my life. Who're your favorite motion picture stars? Fred Astaire and Myrna Loy. Stand up, stand up. Tell me why. They have elegance and poise. I wish they'd been my parents. Who are your parents? My father died in a train crash when I was nine. And what about your mother? What about your mother? - She died, uh, last year. - What? I didn't hear you. My mother died too, last year. Oh, I'm so sorry. W-W-What was she like? What do you remember most about your mother? Oh, come on, Daisy. Come on. Your mother loved music. Her last wish was to - hear you sing once more. - Hear me sing once more. Right, kill the choir and dim the lights in exactly one minute. Now, come let them adore you, dear. On Christmas Eve... wise men always follow a star. Stars light up the world and shine all the way into men's hearts. And from time to time a miracle occurs. A new star appears in the sky. We see it a long way off, very small but very bright. We watch it move up there and take its place beside the other constellations. Now, this Yuletide... I'm inviting you, in motion picture theaters all over the world... to join with me. Look up with me... and celebrate...

Bravo! The world has met Daisy Clover. Now... Daisy Clover meets the world. I persuaded Ray to cut down your numbers with the choir, if it's any comfort to you at all. I'm sure it's a comfort to the choir. So, just "God Rest You, Merry" and "Holy Night." "Good King Wenceslas" is out, dear. Perfect. Hideously perfect. You've got time for a nap if you like, dear. Bedroom's through there. It'll all be over soon. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world. B-but don't worry. And we meet... in the castle of lost souls. In the land of the Black Swan. Otherwise known as the Prince of Darkness. Welcome, little captive to the waterfall of sweet dreams. Melora says it washes all her cares away but I, I need stronger stuff. As one fallen angel to another, would you care to get drunk? - Yeah. - What on? Sweet sherry. Ah! There was a young lady named Cherry who used to get swacked on sweet sherry. And when they said... Uh, when they said, what? What? Well, what? Help me. Help me, when they... - Um. - W-what? When they said what? - Um... - "Do you think, uh, it's a sensible drink?" That's good. She replied... "Not very." You always go to parties like that? I've got a show to do. You have a sh...? Hm. Unholy order. Daisy Clover? U-uh. That's your real name? - Yeah. - Sure? Yeah. It's the one thing about me they haven't changed. It's the one thing about me they have. Your real name isn't Wade Lewis? No, no, it isn't. It's Lewis Wade. They took a poll and decided that it was sexier the other way around. Well, but that's, uh, that's not your problem, of course. - What? - Sex. It's not your image at all. Don't... oh... no, don't be insulted. I just mean that you're being peddled for something else. You're Miss Huckleberry Finn. Clean, sharp as a whistle. That's it. That's what it is. God rest, God rest you merry ladies and gentlemen. Let nothing you dismay. Unto us a child star is born. Littlest dipper on its Swanny Way. Shine on, shine on, orphan star, into the hearts and the minds of men, who cares or wonders what you really are? Swan, the father, has done it again! What's the matter? My father just died. He had the golden touch. Did you ever hear of the Slumber-Rite mattress? Hm? No. Well, it's a big moneymaker. What am I gonna do with it? I, uh, I never had to worry about a place to sleep. My mother's supposed to be dead. Actually, they put her away. Merry Christmas, dear heart. Everything's for you, except the yellow roses. - Who are they for? - Your crazy mother. Shall we cutout? 'Good evening, Wade.' Wade always hides at parties. I never caught him stealing before. Well, nothing you'll miss, dear heart. How do you know what I miss? Has he made his speech about the Prince of Darkness yet? - What's next? - Guess. Uh. A dirty joke? - No. - A getaway? - Nope. - Very good at getaways. No, I've hidden, and I've stolen... and now I'm ready to drive Daisy home. She's scheduled to sing with the choir. Well, have a black mass instead. Drive carefully. Farewell! Poor, rich... lovely, lonely lady. Miss Clover, there's someone here to see your aunt. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Mr. Wade Lewis, sir. I'm your most devoted fan. Merry Christmas, Mrs. Clover. Though we've never met, I've heard a great deal about you. I'm inviting you to a party. Let's open the sweet sherry, dear heart. Try and concentrate, old chap. Get in a party mood. She's right. She's got nothing to celebrate. - Christ died for you. - Thank you, what's your name? I... I'm not allowed to say. - May I call you Dolores? - Oh, no. No, no, wait, wait, you remind me of a poem called "Dolores." 0 wise among women, and wisest, Our Lady of Pain. - Oh, Merry Christmas. - Merry Christm... Oh, d-don't, don't go, Dolores. Come and share our feast. I, uh, I think Dolores could use a little of that wine. - Champagne? - Thank you. Luncheon is now being served, Mrs. Clover. Last call. Here. We're not celebrating anything. Lights have just gone up. Applause. It seems to go on forever. Thousands of faces... looking up at us. Uh-huh. Ah, ah, ah! Hold it, hold it. Just a little longer. Little longer. That's it. Now, don't hang your head. Well, I want a big happy smile. Come on, we're at the party now, come on, a big, big, big smile. Big, big, big smile. Bigger, bigger. Bigger, bigger, bigger. That's it. - Like it? - Adorable. Open it. First-aid premiere kit, dear. For a growing girl. All right, the limousine will pick you up at your dressing room. Uh, just a moment, Daisy. I hear Wade Lewis paid a visit to your mother. Quite a few nurses' hearts fluttered. There are certain risks which must never be taken. Daisy... from now on, I can't allow you to see her anymore. Now, don't forget. Big, happy smile. Oh, Miss Clover? Something for your memory book. I agree. Come on. It's not much, but it's home. Easy. Up! Up! Down. I won the Battle of Fredericksburg today. Single-handedly, ahead of schedule. And I need a drink. Just in time for your premiere. Thank you very much. And that, ladies and gentlemen, was Miss Joan Crawford. Always charming and lovely, always gracious. And here comes, uh, I think this is the producer. Yes, it is. Mr. Raymond Swan and his lovely wife. Now, Daisy Clover will be in their party too. She's scheduled to be in their car. No, I don't see her. Uh, excuse me, may I... Maybe I can get a little closer to the car. No, she wasn't in that car. Well, uh, perhaps she's scheduled to be - in another car. Uh... - Cold? Pardon me, just a moment. I'll see if I can't find out from the producer. Uh, excuse me, Mr. Swan. Can you tell me... Oh, he walked straight on in, I guess he couldn't hear me and I don't blame him. There's a tremendous amount of noise going on here as our radio audience can certainly hear. And I suppose he just didn't hear me. Uh, I think this may be Daisy now. The crowd is really beginning to roar. No, it isn't. It's Jean Harlow and Mr. Clark Gable. And would you just listen to that sound, the sound of love. Oh, the crowd is really going mad at this point and I don't blame them, I've never seen so many celebrities and luminaries here on Hollywood Boulevard. But where is Daisy? Where did Daisy go... She's right here, folks. Right here. The little lady's right here. ...she shows up, we'll certain... America's Little Valentine, Miss Clover. - Miss Clover, Miss Clover. - Yes? Uh, there are millions of girls out there in Radioland who are just dying to hear the secret of your success. Um, excuse me. Testing, everything's... Miss Clover, would you mind telling me what your secret unfulfilled ambition is before you get completely stoned? - To get completely stoned. - Ah, I see. Does America's Little Valentine have anything else on her mind except drinking? - Yeah. - Yes. A-and what is that, Miss Clover? She wants to drive a garbage truck. Sh... she... Why? So she can dump a hundred stinking tons of it on Mr. Raymond Swan! Do you know you're a crazy, monstrous child. You are. Streaking through life like a hare with the hounds after you. And they are after you, dear heart, you know? I've checked with the airport, sir. - Mr. Lewis went to New York. - Mm-hm. Shall I find out where he's staying? Hm, would you? Good morning, Daisy. Tear that up, please. What is it? The past. Tear it up. Future. It's worth a lot more money. Well, don't thank me. See that her sister signs it this afternoon. Yes, sir. Well, the picture was a triumph. And you're going to the top of the tree. No question. You want to know what it's like up there, the top of the tree? Like most high places, the air is... very good. It gets lonely at times, but we learn how to deal with that. We learn how to look beyond personal disappointment. I've been lucky. I found Melora. I'm sure you'll find someone... someday. In the meantime, fame does have its obligations. We wouldn't want the newspapers telling us how America's Little Valentine... lost her shoe. That's all. Miss Clover, you'll find your shoes on my desk. And now in response to the millions of Daisy Clover fans, Raymond Swan presents The Daisy Clover Story. The Clover name is a part of the glorious history of these United States, recorded among those courageous pioneers who braved the hardships and dangers of the great trek West to become the builders of the New World. Daisy's ancestors settled in San Francisco. Her great-grandmother sang with the Calhoun Repertory Company. Until she lost her voice in that city's tragic earthquake. Some years later, Daisy's grandparents moved South to a small town called Hollywood. Where a young industry dared to prove to the world what motion pictures could do. Grandpa Clover gambled his future in the rich oil fields of Southern California, where he won, and then lost a fortune. Daisy was born in this simple house. A happy child, destined too soon to know hardship and loneliness. Her father died when she was nine. Life became a constant struggle. Her only escape was to sing, to sing and to dream that some day a miracle would happen. And it did, the day Mr. Raymond Swan played a recording of her voice.

Dear heart... didn't you get my postcard? I wrote you one. Didn't get it. Didn't send it. What'd it say? Nymph, in thy orisons. Be all my sins remembered. What's "orisons?" Prayers. Well, then, why didn't you say so? It's from Hamlet. Oh. Well, I wouldn't have got it if you had sent it. Miss Clover... try these. Here. They were all for you. "London. Happy birthday, Daisy." Where is this? That is Vienna. The Danube. It's not very blue. "Merry Christmas." Mexico City. "Happy New Year. Knoxville, Tennessee.“ What were you doing there? "Missed a train. Miss you too." Then why the hell did you go away? Never look a gift horse in the mouth, dear heart. I came back. You see? Everything's wiped away. They're only asked for croquet. I think we're in for a trickier game. What's it called? It's called "Do What The Man Says." - What? - Well, what's he gonna say? He's gonna say, "Leave my little star alone." But don't worry. You're not expected to play. - Why? - Why? Because you don't like the game. Come on. So good of you to have invited us. Good of you to come. I don't believe that you've met Miss Clover. Miss Clover, this is Mrs. Swan, Mr. Swan. - Miss Clover, sit down, please. - Thank you. Mr. Swan is in the brow-beating business, dear heart. - Booze is over there, Wade. - Right. Whoop! Uh... I... Sorry. Did you want anything while I was up? - No, thank you. - No. Sir? No, thank you. I could have you arrested. U-uh... What... what charge would you have in mind? Oh, America's Little Valentine just happens to be jailbait. - Bad publicity. - Not for you. All right, I'll play along. I'm cynical. I'm irresponsible, dear heart. I stop at nothing. No, you're just insecure, like most actors. Isn't that the truth? What is it, that makes us... rich, successful, and unhappy? God knows. Your private life is no concern of mine. But Daisy's career is. - Good business. - Yes. Now look here, if you hurt her, you hurt her work, and I won't allow that. What makes you think I want to hurt Daisy? Well, you do have a problem. She's in love with you. No, but that's no problem. No problem at all. I asked her to marry me this morning. Well, I can hardly stand the suspense. What did she say? Do you wanna tell the man what you said? What did you say? Yes. Yes! I'm truly happy for you both. Baines? Baines. - Open the champagne, please. - Yes, Baines. Yes, Baines, a little champagne for all. It is festive, isn't it? Festive indeed. Well, I must say, I hardly expected quite such a switch. Nothing I said forced you into it or anything? Nothing you said could force me out of it. Uh, shall we have the wedding here, Ray? It's a good idea. And it hasn't even had its first screen kiss. Baines, press release. Today, Sunday, 17th of October... Hey. Where are we? - Jawbone. - What? - Jawbone. - Where's that? Five miles north of Big Snake. Shut up, Buckeye. Arizona. Jawbone. The hour before the dawn. Fifteen. Oh, would, uh, you get the bags, please? They're in the back. I'm gonna learn how to cook. And not just your fish burgers and hot chocolate. Real gourmet muck. From now on, that's it. Goodbye, America's Little Valentine. Hello, Mrs. Wade Lewis. Hello, Mr. Wade Lewis. Actor, drinker, ah, rich boy. Husband. Fool. He left a couple of hours ago. - Well, what'd he say? - Nothin'. Could I have your autograph? You're not Myrna Loy. Mrs. Swan was feeling tired. She took a sleeping pill. Mr. Swan is meeting with your lawyer. He'll see you in the morning. Is there anything you need, Mrs. Lewis? I knew he'd do it. I knew he'd leave you. I knew it. I love him. I'm crazy about him. You poor little jerk. Uh... You want a pill? I took a pill. They think she's got a headache. She hasn't! She's got a heartache! Take me back to my room. Please? Melora's been hurt. I wonder where he's gone. So many places, so many people. So many beds, so many lovers. - Melora, here's your room. - He never sleeps alone. - Needs company. - Here. I... I cut myself when Wade left me. It still hurts sometimes. - You like to cut yourself? - No. - You like to get drunk? - No. - I know, you need a good laugh. - Melora. Hello, long distance, please. Mr. Wade Lewis. Very long distance. Melora, come on. Let's... Hello? Hello. How wonderful to hear your voice. Of course I know you're not Wade. You're the new number. Good luck, dear. What? No, no message. I just called to say, uh... have as much fun as I did. That's the new lover. I didn't get his name, but he sounds charming. Your husband never could resist a charming boy. All the good women and all the good men who tried to put Wade back together again. Age, sex... doesn't matter. They take him to heart, he takes them to bed. Tsk. But, then, like any... lost cause, they can't give him up. They've just got to carry on about true love, new life, deep understanding. Oh. Then one day, they wake up... alone. She... didn't stand a chance. I told Melora she didn't stand a chance. I told her what would happen. It happened. Oh, then she cut her wrists and... blamed me. It appears I lack the finer points. But Wade, oh, boy! He's got 'em all. Thousands of girls sit watching him in dark movie houses... go home and they dream about him in dark, little bedrooms. Thousands of wives wish their husbands were exactly like him. Isn't that something? I mean, you can't help admiring the man. I just signed him for three more pictures. Hm. What are you going to do? He's in New York. He'll be back. Couple of weeks. I'll see you don't run into ea... each other. You're blaming me too, aren't you? Oh. You know, if... Listen, if I'd warned you, if I'd said, "Wade isn't your true love, he's... you're just the best fun he ever had." You'd have called it a wicked lie. And then Wade would have said, uh... "Prince of Darkness stops at nothing, dear heart" and, uh, you'd have eloped immediately. It's over, Daisy. All over. I've got you the best divorce lawyer in town. So, sleep it off. Take a long, deep sleep. Sandman's orders. At least you know all about love. Hm? All about love. Just nothing. Lost cause. Just like your husband. Who needs it? Don't go yet. Don't go away.

Very good, Daisy. Miss Clover? Mr. Swan is expecting you in his office at 6:30. Goodnight, Miss Clover. Listen, old chap. You see, it's... it's the middle of the night... and I honestly believe in... in nothing. And I wonder if that's any way to live. Old chap? Come on, talk to me. Please, come on. Old chap? Morning, Daisy. Morning, Daisy. - You look great. - Thanks. - Coffee? - Thank you. Daisy, I've marked the parts we have to redo. Right here and down here. Come on, gentlemen, let's not keep the star waiting. Are those phones patched in? Yeah, we checked it. - I've checked it. - Well, check mine. Will you give us a level please, Daisy? - One, two, three, four. - Fine. Like to try a run-through first. - Let's do it. - Feeling brave today. All right, Daisy, let's go for a take.

Medical profession is certainly pushing ”ifs" and "buts," they're expensive and I don't need any more. Look here. If she's sane, cure her. If she's mad, certify her. I want her cured so I can finish my picture or certified so I can collect insurance. Miss Clover is not certifiable. Then she's sane and she'd better get up. All right, get that idiot sister out and we'll start again. Time's up, Mrs. Goslett. She needs me. Mr. Swan's orders. Famous young lady. You know you're still getting a hundred letters a day? Mm-hm, everyone misses the Little Valentine. I can't understand why. Everybody's begging her to get out of bed and finish the picture. Isn't it wonderful to have loyal friends who want to help you? You're as sound as a roach. - Fresh as a daisy. - What're you holding out for? Don't you think you'd enjoy getting... Trust me, Daisy. If there's a problem... I can solve it. I always have. All right, come on now, come on now. Try and concentrate, hmm? The world is holding its breath... because my little street Arab holds hers. Isn't that something? The world identifies with you... bonehead. I didn't come before, dear. I haven't been feeling very well. I'm not an angry or jealous person. I only hope he's... he's what you need. Ray, I mean. Now, why don't you get up, finish the picture, and take a long exciting trip? We... We could go around the world together, if you like. Try and hang on, anyway. Like me. Dear heart. Yellow roses. Sweet sherry. Can't stop singing. World's still a garbage dump. I don't blame you for holding out, of course. The hounds are still after you. But, um... won't you join me back in the limelight, little Lady of Pain? Then mayn't I pronounce you officially alive. I want to talk to Miss Clover alone. Don't you think the Little Valentine's been bluffing long enough? Missed me? Open your eyes. Talk. Speak. Well, say something. My hair's going gray. My gray-haired teenager. Welcome back. All right, here's the schedule. I'm dismissing your nurse. And I'm giving you exactly one hour to get dressed, bathed, perfume... all by yourself. I want you ready when I come back. Ready to give the devil his dues? So it's beginning to feel a little chipper, asking to play rough again, eh? Listen. I'm dismissing your nurse anyway. You'll get up, or you'll lie here and you'll starve and if you starve I'll sue you. We're legally in business for five years and you're legally fit to work. Still not rough enough? Like to play again? All right. You don't cost me money, you make it! Picture's a big investment, I want it finished. Afterwards... I don't care what happens to you. There's more where you came from. I'll just write you off. Nurse? So we're up. Doesn't it feel good? Sorry to barge in like this, but I forgot my book. Hello? Oh! Here it is. Miss Clover, I have a favor to ask you for my sister. She's your greatest fan and she's just dying for your autograph. Thank you, Miss Clover. - Goodbye. - Bye. Walter Baines here, Mr. Swan's expecting you at 7:00 in the morning. I'll send a car. Miss Clover? Are you disconnected? Ow! Agh! Here's the situation. I'm pushing 17, and I'm, uh, America's Little Valentine. I've been married for one day. Then I got insulted and divorced. The Prince of Darkness took me in his arms and I almost gave myself the works. But I haven't let it go to my head. I'm still the same happy, adjusted, polite young lady. And I'll bet my simple, healthy instincts against yours... any day. Hey, what happened back there? Someone declared war.
