LAST SCREENING - Good evening. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Good evening, Mr. Paul. - Hello, Sylvain. - So the cinema's closing? - Of course not. - I heard it was. - You were misinformed. Good, then. What happened? Don't ask. I fell off a ladder organizing my bookshelves. - You read too much, Mr. Paul. - Yes. - Goodnight, Sylvain. - Goodnight. Here's the theater. - I'll need the blueprints. - I'll fax them when I get home. We'll tear down that wall to build the store's main aisle. That might work, yes. - How many seats? - 196. I bought it in '78. It was an old jazz club. I spent a bundle. I had it all redone. - It's beautiful. - Yes, but not profitable. Shall we continue the tour? When would you start renovations? As soon as possible. Once we've signed. These old wine cellars were used for storage. I haven't been down here in ages. What is all this junk? It's my press material. You'll have to get rid of it. Do you realize we're closing in 3 days? It's spacious, too. Perfect for a stockroom. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Found work, Sylvain? - Yes. See that the distributors get their prints back. One ticket for "French Cancan," please. The film began a half-hour ago. A half-hour ago? It was scheduled for 6:30. No, 6 o'clock. The showtimes are posted. But I came all the way from Macon to see it! The film screens every day. Come back tomorrow. No way, I'm going in. Ma'am! That's 6 euros. 6 euros? It's already started! You could let me in since it's your mistake. It's not my mistake, ma'am. It's a misprint. Fine, I'll pay then... 6 euros? - Yes, 6 euros. - Okay. Here. - Thank you. - Don't mention it! - Your ticket. - I wouldn't recommend you. - Goodbye. - Enjoy. It's Sylvain Tarnier, manager of the Empire. The times for "French Cancan" are wrong. It's at 6 and 10, daily. What are you talking about? No, we're not closing. Yes. It's the same schedule next week. That's it. Goodbye. Miss? Miss? We're closed. Sorry. I lost my earring. They were my grandmother's. - Sure you had them on? - Yes. I don't see anything. Don't worry, I'll let you know if they turn up. Thanks. It's a pity I fell asleep. Yes, it's a pity. It's a beautiful print. The original colors were restored. It's because of the rehearsals. We worked all night. - You're an actress? - I'm making my debut. It's my first play. Come back and see it. I run it every day. If I find the time. 6 and 10 pm, every day. You'll find the time. I'll try. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. I think I'm lost. I was told it would be easier here. So far it's worse. I sold a grand total of two rings today. Is the cinema doing well? You're not very talkative. And I talk too much. - What's your name anyway? - Sylvain. I'm Dominique. This is my van. It has all the modern conveniences. Even beer. Want one? Yes. I knew you'd be generous. Your eyes don't lie. Is that you Mr. Paul? How are you? "French Cancan"! I saw it 4 times in a row back in the days of continuous showings. - You weren't around to see that. - No. Gabin and Renoir meet again. Do I look like a Prince Charming? All that matters is what I create. Know what that is? You, her, and her. There were others. And there'll be others. What you or I want, do you think that counts? It's what they want that counts. All that counts is what they want. Our responsibility is to the audience. - Know why I don't want you to go? - Not the angry patrons. Screw them. It's 'cause we're losing a trouper. And because, hell, I thought you were one of us. - Hello. - Hi, Manon. This is Mr. Paul. - Hello. - Delighted. - Has it started? - No, you're just in time. - May I? - Go right in. Go ahead. Refresh your memory. I still think he's cynical. He makes Nini choose between her lover and the cabaret. Yes, but for him... everything must be sacrificed for the stage. For that, he uses her love for him. It's just a means. For him, there's something greater. Greater than love, greater than life: the stage. And he'll sacrifice everything for it. Even his love for Nini. You don't agree. No. Little waif, I feel your hand Looking for mine I feel your chest and your slender waist, I forget my pain... Nineteen sixty-three. 1963. "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg." Good night. 'Night. It's been 6 years since we tied the knot You fathered my kids and that means a lot Ever since we met on the dance floor I've loved you more and more But tonight I want to take off my apron And put my prom dress on Your recliner, the paper cigarettes and TV Forget them tonight, remember me Take me dancing tonight Cheek to cheek in the moonlight Make me feel like a queen Like the night you took me when I was seventeen Take me dancing tonight Let's flirt beneath the moonlight Whisper shyly, "Michèle, I love you," My heart has stayed true All that matters to you is football and your friends And I feel like you only see me as the mother of your children I'm not asking for flowers every day Just show your love in little ways. Tonight I want to be with the man I miss To stay out late and kiss you Your recliner, the paper, cigarettes and TV Forget them, remember me Take me dancing tonight Cheek to cheek in the moonlight Make me feel like a queen Like the night you took me when I was seventeen Take me dancing tonight Let's flirt beneath the moonlight Whisper shyly, "Michèle, I love you," Do you go there often? No, it was my first time. I'm a regular. I like to sing. I'm exhausted. I can't wait to see my kids. - Got any kids? - No. How old are you? - 31. - You've still got time. I have two. A little one and a big one. Two girls. It's tough with the big one. Especially when I work nights... I never know what they're up to. That'll be 14 euros. Can you wait 5 minutes? I'm not sure if my mother's home. Okay, but make it quick. I feel your hand looking for mine I feel your chest and slender waist I forget my pain I detect on your lips That you must be sick Like a malnourished kid And in your caress I feel a drunkenness That overwhelms me The steps of Montmartre Are steep for the lonely But the windmill wings Keep lovers safe But now it's raining The moon is waning And the Princess, too Under the moonless sky, I cry and cry My dream vanishes So she's not home? What now? It's late. I'll take you to town, but I'm not going any further. We don't have all night. What's wrong with you? Say something! This is absurd! You dragged me out here. Now make a decision! Shut up! Shut up! Hello? Hello, Mr. Martel. No, I haven't noticed any messengers. I've seen no one at all. Yes. Yes, I know the cinema is closed. Yes, I have! Yes, I've started cleaning up. Because you have my word. - Here you are. - Thanks. Evening, sir. Two tickets, please. Thank you. Hello. I brought you a poster for my play. Got a minute? I have to start the film. I'll wait at the cafe. Come by afterwards. Don't you need it? No, it's for you. Don't you think they're pretty? No. - You don't like them? - They're ugly. I think they're pretty. - Who gave them to you? - None of your business. - I'm telling dad. - No you're not! The man from yesterday gave them to you. You're a liar. You're supposed to rip off the earring. Start again. Don't you think they're pretty? No. - You don't like them? - They're ugly. I think they're pretty. - Who gave them to you? - None of your business. I'm telling dad! No you're not! We've been rehearsing all week! The audition's in an hour. - I'm tired. - Tired? Tired? We've been rehearsing the whole goddamn week! Start again and concentrate! Concentrate and let's go! - I'm telling dad! - No you're not! The man from yesterday gave them to you. You're a liar. Finally! We're gonna be okay. Finally, we're gonna be okay. I'm proud. I'm proud. You did good. You'll be like them. One day. You're still here! The owner gave me the key. I have to finish measuring. The blueprints show an extra room downstairs I missed. There is no extra room. Yes, there is. Look. You can't go down there, it's my home. - Mr. Martel said I could. - So bring Mr. Martel. I have no time to lose. It's my home! See? One ticket, please. Here. I hope it's not black and white. You'll find out, Mina. Will you sing me a song? Let's see... what song can I sing you? Monday morning The Emperor, his wife and the Prince Came to my house to shake my hand Since I'd gone out to play the Prince was heard to say If we may We'll come back Tuesday Tuesday morning the Emperor, his wife and the Prince Came to my house to shake my hand Since I'd gone out to play the Prince was heard to say If we may We'll come back Wednesday - Did I scare you? - No. Liar! Usually customers aren't allowed in here. I wanted to invite you to my dress rehearsal. What about the cinema? You spend your life in the cinema. Abandon it, for once. At least see the last act. It's Martel for the third time. What the hell's going on? The distributor... You're one of them. You're one of them! Theseus, I cannot hear you and keep silent. I must repair the wrong he has suffered: your son was innocent. Unhappy father! And I condemned him on your word. Think you such cruelty can be excused? These moments are dear to me. Hear me, Theseus! 'Twas I who... cast an eye of incestuous passion. on your chaste and dutiful son. Heaven in my bosom kindled baleful fire and vile Oenone's cunning did the rest. She feared Hippolytus, knowing my madness, would make my horrible passion known. She took advantage of my weakness and hastened to accuse him first. Seeking to shun my wrath, she sought too mild a punishment beneath the waves. The sword would have cut my destiny short, but instead I heeded the cry of my slandered innocence. I took a longer path to death in order to confess my sins to you. You really liked it? Yes, very much. I had to use a lot of aging makeup to look the part. Did I overdo it? Not at all. You missed a spot. New earrings? You don't recognize them? I wore them on stage. You'd have to be seriously disturbed to do something like that, no? Mommy? Mommy? Sylvain? Sylvain! Sylvain. No. What's wrong? Mommy. Alex, you're better than the rest of us. Neither better nor worse. I'm just different. In the jungle, animals live in families, in clans. Mixing is punishable by death. I trespassed but made it out alive. I'm a lucky guy. You have a way with words. Would you do me a big favor? - A favor, me? - Yes. Before I leave, give me fake memories of my life in Paris. Move over, please. I can't see, sir. - Still quitting? - Are you crazy? - Would you like to be on stage? - Oh, yes! THE END English subtitles by baaab
