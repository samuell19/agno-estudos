Concentrate, Arturo. We're almost finished Your honesty is important in ensuring the accuracy of the test results. Yes. What is your favourite dish? Honey, are you sure we need to do this? Arturo, we keep postponing this Come on, answer. It's important. All our friends did it too Yeah? But are you sure? Why are we trusting this app? Again? I don't want to end up like my parents, who spent their whole lives fighting. With this app, we can find out if we're really made for each other. - Really? - Ever since Happy Lovers came out, Divorces have decreased by 77%. I'll repeat the question What is your favourite dish? Calm down, eh? We were just talking... Alright, um... Cacio e pepe... ... and lasagne Oh, hang on, not crispy on top. Not. Crispy. On. Top Think of a colour Blue Favourite singer? Nina Simone Good, now our algorithm will process your answers along with Lisa's Relax I'm sorry, but you're couples' compatibility score is negative. Ah... It's just a little game Come on darlings, put these on. They're all waiting on you for the choreography Just give us a minute A minute? Come on, life is short. Come here... Come on, Lisa Attention, guys I don't care! Maybe I shouldn't have said blue... What? I said, maybe I shouldn't have said blue I don't even like blue Look at how you're dressed How cool is this party, guys? We would have been cancelled for dressing like this when we were young! ♪ Cut the grain! Yes, yes ♪ ♪ Shoot the resistance fighter! ♪ Long live pussy! We just sat there watching, like a bunch of assholes - It's a tragedy - What is? - Lisa broke up with me - Why? She said it showed that we've got problems. And she said it Just when we were about to move in together All I'm saying is, we would know ourselves if we're in love or not. We don't need an app to tell us that I know, I know. It's the trend these days People think that if an app doesn't tell you, you can't be together Arturo, you need to be patient. Yeah, patience... I get it, but I'm getting old... I'm looking to the future. I want to start a family, I don't have time to waste Ok, I get it, but this is the face I've got... Excuse me There's a problem with the... He's here - Who's that? - It's Giammarresi... [HEAD OF STAFF] Giammarresi... I've closed the door So we can have a little privacy. It's just the two of us You must be happy -Really? -Yeah! Without you, we would have never been able to make this transition Your algorithm has helped us eliminate pockets of unproductiveness which were unnecessary to the company Sorry... If I haven't misunderstood, you're telling me that the algorithm I introduced has decided That I'm unnecessary? Is that what you're saying? Giammarresi Do you know who we have to thank for the defeat of the nazis? Winston Churchill And despite this, in the July 1945 election, the British people... Did not renew their faith in him But today, why do we -- you and I -- remember Winston Churchill? Why? For that defeat of his? Or for his victory? It's history It's history Gentlemen, It's crucial that we immediately deploy this algorithm, which will finally allow us to cut out useless and cumbersome procedures which are costing us time and above all, money Work smarter, not harder What am I supposed to do now? Come on, you'll pick yourself back up soon enough Antonio... ... I need a salary It's time to find something new that wil... I don't think you understand... I lost everything... ... I spent everything on Lisa How? Keeping up with her and her friends, all the dinners, trips... "Experiences" They're nothing like us. They're on a higher level Your chair, please Young man, the chair. Maybe you could leave the chair, for my replacement? We're going to put the coffee machine there FindAManager.it Name... Arturo... Surname... Giammarresi ... Age... Come on, come on, come on... No, come on! HouseOfJob.it... Age... My god... What a country... Ah, there it is! The English one works straight away Higher, higher higher... And just like that, I've wasted a whole morning... Good morning. It seems that there's a problem with your system, because I can insert my name and surname... But when I try to enter my age, it stops at forty. And I can't enter my own age. Do you understand? And that would be...? Forty-eight I dunno, maybe there's a virus or something Please stay on the line, I'll check right away Thank you very much I've found the problem, sir. Our algorithm doesn't account for it. Doesn't account for what? The algorithm doesn't account for forty-eight years of age as an option I'm sorry, it "doesn't account" for it? What's someone over forty supposed to do? I'm sorry, but as I said, the algorithm doesn't account for it I get it's an algorithm, but you're there, and you can read my resume. Does an experience of over twenty years count for anything, or not? Eh? Hello? Hello? Do you need anything else, sir? Hi, I'm John Fuuber... Hi Is anyone there? Welcome to Fuuber. How can I help you? Hi, I'm here for a job interview Your name, please? Giammarresi... Arturo Giammarresi Let me check... -In the meantime, please have a seat -Thanks [German] Oh, I'm sorry.

Who even is this guy? Nina Simone wasn't actually her real name. She's actually called Eunice Kathleen Waymon Yeah, yeah, Nina Simone was a tribute to a French actress called Simone Signoret We're wrong to call her "Nina Simone" in fact We should pronounce it as the French do - Nina Simohn - Simohn - Because French is more "mohn" - Simohn And I wonder how you can go around living with two names? It's hard, right? Am I boring you? No, no, no, actually... - So then let's talk about where Nina Simone was born Yes Where do you think she was born?

It's been a rough day Excuse me Have a nice evening We'll talk later - Arturo? I just wanted to clear up... There's nothing to clear up, relax I've been thinking about when you said that we all need somebody... who listens to us, who understands us I wasn't convinced at the start, but then I thought that maybe the algorithm is right. It read inside me, and maybe... Jean-Pierre really is the person I need right now I'm very happy for you. Just remember... You need to renew your subscription Bye Arturo, you've performed is below average Your rating is very low Very far from a satisfactory result If I don't receive any more orders, how am I supposed to improve my rating?

It hasn't been launched in Italy yet It's called "Fuuber Infinity" With this, you'll be able to improve your position Are you interested? Am I interested? Yes It's time to rest Breaktime over!

Now if you'll excuse me, I have to sleep Who is it? Fuuber has arrived Fourth floor And? How's this "Fuuber Infinity" thing going? You know, I thought it it would be worse. Don't get me wrong, it's hard, but doable When you first told me about it, I was thinking "Will he manage it?"... Arturo. What are you doing over there? I'm here But you were here before What are you doing over there? I'm here Mrs Slater... I was also kind of skeptical, but actually... You have to adjust to this pattern of waking, sleeping, waking, sleeping, but you get used to it It's time for a break Yes? Pizza. There we go. Thank you, goodbye Anna, let's go.

They're fake... ephemeral As soon as you turn your phone off, there's nothing left No. No, no. I thought so too, but it's not like that. It's not like that, understand? What do you mean? They're real They're projections of real people. They exist They're in Mumbai, but they exist. They have feelings, passions... They have shitty jobs, just like us Oh shit Why? What did you do? Huh? What did you do? Nothing. I haven't done anything Maybe I opened myself up a bit more than usual But that's normal, it's normal. We open ourselves, it's normal I might have done something a bit more extravagant than usual Such as? Nothing... Nothing, nothing, nothing... You have a dark side... nothing... What am I supposed to do? I'm a professor of philology of novels. What do they do? - Exactly, what do they do? - What do they do? What do they do? Ok, well... Here's what happened Let's try to forget this No, no, no. I won't forget. I'll go over there to her, and I'll get her And I'll bring her here. The problem is she's in a tower... in Mumbai. What am I supposed to do? But I will go. I'll find a way. I don't know how, but... It's not easy But I will go I would love to help you, but your rating is low You have too many crying little Fuubers You're not exactly a reliable client. What are we supposed to do? I know, but it's just a phase It's not just a phase. You're not even answering to the orders being sent to you Yes, but that's because I've decided to change career, do you understand? That's why I need your financial help, to get through this transitional period I understand, we care about satisfying our customers and developing a human connection. We're one of the few banks that still has branches - Exactly - But the problem is the algorithm It blocks our operations. My hands are tied The algorithm... Arturo, I might have found the solution to your problems Fuuber Tower is looking for window cleaners Yes. And? And if you get the job, you can get into the tower, and see Stella How's that going to work? They're auctioning it. I've been trying to get it all morning, but there's someone who keeps undercutting me - How much are they bidding? - Nine euros Nine euros an hour is good. That's better than delivering for Fuuber - No, it's per day - Per day? Crazy... - Oh well. Bid eight - Eight? Yeah, it won't make a difference anyway - Bastard - Bastard - Immediately... - Yeah, immediately Six - Six? - Six. Do it And now? - Bastard! - Goddamn bastard It's automatic... Bid four and a half. Four and a half Four and a half, I want to see what he'll do - Bastard! - STOP! STOP IT! STOP! Do three and a half - Three and a half? - Three and a half. Let's have a look - He doesn't even wait! - Look at this goddamn bastard! Look at this guy! One ninety-nine! One-ninety nine, go on. Let's try one ninety-nine - Bastard! - Look at him! Look at hiim! - Goddamn it! - It's not a person, it's an algorithm! Someone wrote an algorithm to keep undercutting us! It's making me so fucking mad! - Just to mess with us! - It's not over yet - No, it's already over - No, it's not over! - It's always the same! - Look! Look! Take that! And that! And another one! Look! I got it, I got it! - How much? - Five euros. I'm paying for it - Good - Yeah, it's good I think that this government initiative is excellent I've been waiting for a reform like this for some time. As a citizen, I'd like to say "Thank you, minister. Well done, captain. Carry on" Send message - Good morning - Good morning! Sorry, weren't you a hater? Yes, but now I'm also working as a lover Because I needed a side hustle for my side hustle's side hustle Also because I renewed my Fuuber Friends subscription Listen, thanks for the ticket. I can't imagine how much it cost you Don't worry about it. It's a low-low-cost flight Low-low-cost? Yeah, it's the low-cost's low-cost offering - Well, thanks anyway - Don't mention it You ugly, piece of shit whore. And what about the gulags? Send message It's time for the turnover. You're supposed to be hanging - What? - Yes, you booked an alternating seat The first half of your journey is seated, and the second half on your feet It's the lady's turn to sit now Standing for for hours? What were you expecting? It's a low-low-cost No, no, no. I can't come. You know what it's like here, it's a massacre They make you work around the clock, there's no sense of day or night Jean-Pierre... These people, they want you to always be available. Yes Jean-Pierre? Arturo, Raffaello's friend, I don't know if you... Oh, Arturo! What are you doing here? It's a long story, and kind of hard to tell Sorry, just one moment. Honey, listen. I'll call you back later, alright? - Bye - May I? Of course I'm looking for Stella Stella? Stella, my ideal Fuuber Friend Her name's not Stella No, her name is Flora. Her real name is Flora - Flora - Yes At work here, we use a different name A stage name, just like film actors - My name isn't Jean-Pierre, you know - It's not? No. My name is Gianpiero. Gianpiero Clementucci Originally... - I was a surveyor - Really? I administered condominiums. And I was highly sought-after Yes. But then they decided to entrust everything to a piece of software I totally understand At the end of the day, this is a decent job Apart from the isolation... The rhythm is all over the place... But... It's a good compromise, isn't it? You're right. In the end, we all do what we need to to get by Yes, yes. I say the same thing all the time To exist here... But Arturo... It's not right The thing is, you see... Maybe tomorrow, things could be worse than this And later worse, and worse And when this happens... ... because it will happen... Arturo... We, who watched things grow worse and worse We're going to ask ourselves, "what did we do to stop it?". And do you know what we'll say? What? We just sat there watching, like a bunch of assholes I'm sorry, I got a bit carried away there... I was a trade unionist, when I was younger - Ah, the unions - Yeah, the unions. A bit nostalgic... But let's talk about you. Did you meet Flora yet? I don't know where to begin looking, if I'm honest I'll take you. Gianpiero will take you. Come on, let's go! This here is where we work The holograms are made here, and are then broadcasted to subscribers around the world Everything OK? You feeling energized? - Alright, let's go - Extraordinary No. The truth is that you're cheating on me! But they're... That happens too... I know her She's the one with the necklace What necklace? A strange guy, he gave her a necklace Good night Federico, it's been an exhausting day I'll leave you with your favourite song There she is... The person you're looking for You're insane What did I do? We never finished our conversation, remember? What's wrong with your head? It's a woolen hat, for my migraines You were saying: "I ..." "I ..." No, this is impossible I can't believe you've done this It's just a woolen hat. It's not like I killed somebody "I ..." You have no idea how many times I've wished you were by my side Me too, Stella I never said it because I was scared. I thought you would judge me Me too, Flora I love you Really? I love you too, Stella You're even more beautiful in real life - Listen, we should leave because... - Shh Where are we going? I can't leave this place I signed a sixteen-month contract for constant availability I physically can't leave, OK? I can't OK, but what is this, a prison? It's worse. It's worse And besides, even if there was a way out of here My life would be a disaster I wouldn't be able to get a loan, or a job, or rent a house And Fuuber would destroy my reputation I would have nothing left And what do I have? I don't have money. I don't have a salary I paid to have this job I don't have security or credibility I don't have a reputation anymore I don't have any faith or hope I don't even have a bike, because it got stolen I have nothing at all But I still have my head My arms, my legs, and my heart And I have you All of this, is mine And I'm not giving it up And you shouldn't give it up either We just sat there watching, like a bunch of assholes
