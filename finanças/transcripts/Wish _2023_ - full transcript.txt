(GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING) NARRATOR: Once upon a time, there was a young man who believed there was nothing more important than a wish. Not just any wish, of course. The one that drives your heart. The one that makes you who you are. But he also understood just how impossible it can be to make that wish come true. How easily dreams can be destroyed. And so, he set out to do something about it. He studied the magic of the world tirelessly and became a mighty sorcerer, able to protect from harm or ill will, any wish given to him, and for the good and the worthy, even grant that wish. The sorcerer didn't know if the world would want his gift. But he and his loyal wife found the most perfect island deep in the Mediterranean Sea. And there they built a kingdom like no other, where anyone, any family, no matter where they came from, were welcome. Can this boat go any faster? (MAN GAGS) NARRATOR: And to their joy, people came, settled there from far and wide, gave their wish and appreciation for his protection, and with the very real hope it could one day be granted. (GOAT BLEATS) And everyone agrees there is no one more deserving... - (GOAT BLEATING) - than my grandfather. (BLEATS) - A most loving... - (BLEATS) - (QUICKLY) ...and handsome... - (BLEATS) man who turns 100 years old today. Oh, that's it? - Now you're done talking? - (BLEATS) Valentino's never done talking. (CHUCKLES) If only we could understand you. (BLEATS DISAPPOINTEDLY) The King has called a wish ceremony today! - (LAUGHS) - Oh! Oh. Oh! This is it! No, it can't be a coincidence the King is calling a wish ceremony on your birthday. Putt, putt, putt, and knock on wood. Tonight's your night, Saba. I can feel it. Asha, let's bake a cake. Oh! (INHALES SHARPLY) Uh... - (HESITANTLY) No. - But I love cake. I mean, I... I can't. - I'm giving a tour and then... - Hmm. Um, I'm helping. I'm helping Dahlia. - Yeah. So, eh... (CHUCKLES) - SABINO: Hmm. - Why'd you say it like that? - Like what? What are you up to? What makes you think that I'm up to something? Because I know your pauses. I'm maturing. My pauses are changing. Asha! Can't talk now, I'm gonna be late. - (BLEATS) - Oh. I'll see you at the wish ceremony. SABINO: Oh, I wouldn't miss it. I've got a good feeling about it! (PLEASANT MUSIC PLAYING) I'm here! I'm here. I'm here. Whew! Just one second.

You're welcome to stay and watch. - BOY: I love food! - Enjoy. WOMAN: This is amazing! MAN 1: I want to live here. MAN 2: So do I. WOMAN 2: I'm never leaving. WOMAN 3: This is delicious! - Help me! - Huh? Best friend and honorary doctor of all things rational, my interview is in one hour, and I'm so nervous I think I'm going to explode. - (VALENTINO BLEATS) - Interview. What interview? - Dahlia? - (CHUCKLES) You mean the interview with our velvety sweet buttercream of a king. Oh, please don't say it like that. My best friend, the King's apprentice. I'll be famous. I have forgotten how to talk. I have no words. Is my mouth drooping? I feel like it's drooping. (TRILLS LIPS) Quick, ask me an interview question. Okay, Asha, what's your weakness? Weakness? Um... I get irrational when I'm nervous. No, no. You care too much. I do? Wait. Is that a weakness? That's why it's perfect. You're welcome. - Just relax. - (BREATHES DEEPLY) You're surrounded by friends. (SNORING) (SNIFFING) (GASPS) Cookies? - ALL: Cookies. - I like cookies. - Me first. - Look out. GABO: Out of my way! BOY: Yes, yes, yes. DARIO: Cookies. Give me the cookies. - SIMON: Out of the way! - Slow down. - Move over. Okay, okay. - I love cookies. - Safi, they're lemon. - Oh, no. (INHALES) - Yes. - (SNEEZES) Ugh! Life is so unfair. - Take mine. - (GASPS) Bazeema, where did you come from? Hi. (CHUCKLES) Oh, take mine, too. I can't eat. Oh, right. Your interview with the King. Hey, look at me. Don't worry. We'll be here for you when you fail. Gabo. Oh, there are the cookies. Oh, Safi sneezed on those. Oh, thanks. OTHERS: Ew. Anyway. Not that I blame you for trying to cheat the system. What? I'm not trying to cheat at anything. (CHUCKLES) Come on. Everyone knows the racket. The King's apprentices get their wishes granted, and usually their family's wishes, too. - Uh... - Not always. - ALL: Mm-mm. - Ooh. - Maybe always. - ALL: Mm-hmm. Wait, isn't your Saba turning 100 today and still waiting? - Ignore him. - GABO: Bah-bah-bah-bah-bah! Not to mention the fact that you're also turning 18. - Happy birthday. - In a few months... not today. And when you give your wish to the King, you don't wanna have to end up like Simon here, do you? Huh? What's wrong with Simon here? It's... I don't know. You're kind of boring now. No offense. Have I become boring? Do... Do you all think that? - Achoo. - No, not boring. - Just... - Calmer. Oh. Oh, Simon, don't worry. You're still you, and I bet you'll get your wish granted really soon. Unlike your poor old Saba who's still waiting... - (BLOWS) - (COUGHING) (COUGHS, CLEARS THROAT) - The Queen. - (GROUP GASPS) - Your Majesty. - Queen Amaya. Oh, my goodness. Asha, the King is ready for you. Now? Am I late? I thought I... You're fine. - The last interview... - (DOOR OPENS) - It was a disaster! (SOBBING) - (OBJECTS CLATTERING) finished early. Shall we? Oh, okay, I'm ready. I am so not ready. You're fine. Just don't touch anything. Don't forget to curtsy, - and tell him I love him. - What? I'm kidding. Do not tell him that. (CHUCKLES) Great. Thank you. Thank you so much. Bye. Don't get your hopes up. - (VALENTINO BLEATS) - (GABO GRUNTS) - (BLEATS) - (GABO HUFFS) QUEEN AMAYA: The apprentice should always keep the fire going because the King likes his tea hot. - Uh-huh. - He also likes to talk. - Quite a bit. - (CHUCKLES) - Feel free to just listen. - Oh, I'm a good listener. Some items might seem strange, but why a sorcerer needs what a sorcerer needs - is not your concern. - Right. And above all, do not expect to see the wishes. - Don't even ask. - Yes, ma'am. I mean, I won't, Your Majesty. I'm rooting for you, Asha. - You are? - Mm-hmm. Oh, thank you, ma'am. But... why? Well, I see the way you look out for others. It's clear how much you love this kingdom and its people. Well, of course. That kind of generosity has always been the true essence of Rosas. (CHUCKLES COYLY) Now, are you ready to meet the King? Oh, I hope so. (CHUCKLES) (SIGHS HEAVILY) (ASHA GASPS) - (ENCHANTING MUSIC PLAYING) - Wow. (CHUCKLES) He'll be right with you. I'm going to check on the ceremony. Oh, okay. Um... Bye. (SNIFFS) (ASHA SIGHS IN AWE) Huh. "Fire Magic, "History of Spells." Whoa! - Huh. Oh! - No, no. No, no. (CHUCKLES) Asha, that book is forbidden. Oh. Hi. I was just, um... - (CRACKLING) - (SHRIEKS) What's happening? Well, I put a spell on the... (CLEARS THROAT) on the glass. Well, I just thought the etchings were pretty. Yes, but the book... - the book is dangerous. - Ow! Then why have it? A king must be prepared for everything. Hold on. Hold still, hold still. (CHUCKLING) - (ASHA EXCLAIMING) - Oop! Don't move, I got it. ASHA: No, no. - (ASHA GRUNTING) - (KING MAGNIFICO CHUCKLES) - A bit of exercise. - Shoo, shoo. Shoo, shoo, shoo. - Um, are you okay? - Shoo, shoo. (GRUNTS) No. I... (FUMBLES) I mean, yes. And I understand if you want me to leave and never show my face again. Oh, please, let's not overreact. You're here. You've certainly got my attention. So, go ahead. Tell me why you think you should be my apprentice. Okay, well... (CHUCKLES, CLEARS THROAT) I care too much. Okay, that's interesting. It's my weakness. Figured I might as well get through all the bad stuff right up front. Fair enough. And your strengths? Glad you asked. I'm a quick learner and a hard worker, and I help well. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) And I'm young, so I'm malleable, but not too young - so that I'm too malleable. - Ah. Oh, and I like to draw. Is this anything? Uh... What am I looking at? - It's a goat. - Oh! - It's hopping. - Certainly. - See? - Oh, again. - It's hopping. - That is a unique talent. Do we call that a talent? Oh, well, it's just something my father taught me. I think I remember your father. - Really? - He was a philosopher, wasn't he? Always talking about the stars. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) We used to climb that tree on the high ridge, where it becomes just you and the stars. You know, he'd say, "The stars are there to guide us, "to inspire us, "to remind us to believe in possibility." Well, even when he was sick, he'd take me out at night to dream. All I dreamed about was him getting better. How old were you when he passed? Twelve. That's not fair, is it? When I was young, I too suffered great loss. I... I didn't know that. I'm sorry. KING MAGNIFICO: My entire family. Our lands were destroyed by selfish, greedy thieves. Hmm, if only I'd known magic then. (INHALES DEEPLY) You see, I founded this kingdom so there would be a place where everyone is safe. Asha, no one should ever have to see their dreams destroyed before their eyes. No one should have to live their life feeling the pain of that loss every day. And that's why I do what I do. And that's why I want to work for you. Mm-hmm. Come with me. (GASPS SOFTLY) (GASPS) You're one of the very few I have ever invited in here. But if I'm to trust you, I need to know you understand just how important they are. "They"? The wishes of Rosas. (ASHA GASPING) (ASHA CHUCKLES) You can feel them, already, can't you? They are everything. Oh, I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that. - (GROANS SOFTLY) - No, no, that's it. They are everything. I didn't expect them to be so... alive. - (BOTH CHUCKLE) - Yes. You see, people think wishes are just ideas. But no, no, they are a part of your heart. The very best part.

What do you say? (FAINT DREAMY MUSIC PLAYING) Asha? It's my Saba Sabino's wish. It's his birthday today, and he's 100 years old. That's impressive. Your Majesty... (SIGHS) would you maybe consider granting his wish tonight? Well, that was fast, wasn't it? (CHUCKLES) (GROANS) You know, most people wait a few months, even a year, before they start asking me for things. I'm so sorry. - I did not mean to... - No, no, it's okay. It's okay. Here, let me see the wish. It is a beautiful wish. Beautiful. - Mm. - (INAUDIBLE) But, unfortunately, it's too dangerous. Dangerous? Your Saba longs to create something to inspire the next generation. Great wish but too vague. Create what? A rebellious mob, perhaps? To inspire them to... to do what? Uh, destroy Rosas, maybe? My Saba would never do anything to hurt anyone. - You think that. - I know that. Well, you're young. You don't know anything, really. Whereas it is my responsibility to only grant the wishes I am sure are good for Rosas. So, most of these wishes will never be granted? Yet I still protect them like all the others. Can't you just give them back instead? Excuse me? The wishes you're not going to grant, you could just give them back. Then, I don't know, the people can try to pursue them themselves? You know, if they're dangerous, then they can be stopped, but if they're not... You've completely missed the point. People come here because they know they can't make their own dreams come true. The journey's too hard. It is too unfair. They give their wishes to me, willingly, and I make it so they forget their worries. You make it so they forget the most beautiful part of themselves. And they don't know what they're missing. But you do. And now I do. It's not fair. My Saba is good. The people of Rosas are good. They deserve more than... (LOUDLY) I decide what everyone deserves! (DOOR OPENS) Mi Rey? Sorry to interrupt. But it's time for the ceremony. Is it, my love? Hmm. Seat Asha with you on the main stage. Oh, no. No, no. It's okay. I insist. - (FANFARE MUSIC PLAYING) - (CHEERS AND LAUGHTER) (GRUNTS) (CROWD CHEERING) Are you ready, Rosas? (CROWD CHEERS) Another beautiful night in my kingdom. So good to see you. Good to be seen. First things first. We have two new citizens ready to give their wishes. (CROWD CHEERS) Helena, Esteban, you're going to be very happy here, I promise you. Now make a wish and hold it in your heart. (HOPEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) - (CROWD CHEERING) - (BOTH GASP) It's a real weight off, isn't it? MAN 1: Forget without regret. Whoo! KING MAGNIFICO: Okay then, who is ready to have their wish granted? MAN 2: Grant my wish! Over here! Now, I have been challenged today to take a chance and try something new. Thank you, Asha. And it is with clarity and an open heart full of love that I grant today's wish to someone who has very patiently - waited long enough. - WOMAN: It has to be Sabino. - Sania Osman. - (CROWD CHEERING) Where is Sania? There she is. - Come on up. - He said, "Sania"? It's me? It's me. It's me! Coming through, thank you. It's just so exciting! - Sania Osman... - (CHUCKLES EXCITEDLY) I mean it when I say it truly is my great pleasure to grant your heart's desire to sew the most beautiful dresses in all the land! My wish has come true. - Poor Saba. - He's waited so long. See, never, ever get your hopes up. - KING MAGNIFICO: Asha. - (GASPS) Obviously, I will not be offering you the position as my apprentice. But... But don't worry, I will still protect your Saba's wish and your mother's, forever. (TRIUMPHANT MUSIC PLAYING) - Mi Rey? - Now that went well, don't you think? Are you hungry? (SABINO SIGHS) (VALENTINO BLEATS) (SIGHS) Come now, we don't waste food. Dig in and enjoy. You're right, Saba. (CHUCKLES) We should be looking at the bright side. Asha, you got to the final few being considered for the most prestigious position in the kingdom. And Saba, there's always next time. - Cheers to that. - (CHUCKLES) Asha? Saba, I need to tell you something. Tell me what, child? I don't think, um, your wish... - will ever be granted. - What? Why would you say such a thing? Because the King told me so. He said it's too dangerous to grant. My wish is dangerous? No. That's the thing. I don't think it is at all. You... You saw it? I did. And you should know what it is. No. No. Don't say anything. But it's so, so beautiful. Well, clearly Magnifico feels otherwise, so... Saba, what gives him the right to decide? He... He is the King and he has made everything possible for us. If you had seen them, if you had felt them like I did, you would understand. It's not just yours, Saba. There are so many wondrous, powerful wishes that will never be granted, - just floating there... - Asha? Asha! - Helpless. - Sit down, calm down. I can't! I can't just sit here with you, Saba, knowing your incredible wish - and not tell you. - Then don't. What? You are excused from the table. Saba? Why? Why would you want me to know a wish that can never be? But I didn't... But it's your wish. Are you trying to break my heart, child? - No. No. - (SABINO BREATHES HEAVILY) I... I would never, ever try... (CRYING) I'm sorry. - Asha! - (VALENTINO BLEATS) Asha!

(LAUGHING) I wished for more for us, for my family, and for... Oh. No, no, no, no. Not in, like, a selfish way. I just want their wishes to have a chance. - (SQUEAKS EXCITEDLY) - But, um... Look, see, King Magnifico has their wishes in the castle, captured in these ball-like, bubbly things that are very beautiful but very locked up, and he'll never give them back. What... What are you doing? Careful. My mother was shaved for that yarn! (HOPEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) ASHA: Yes, that's the castle. - (SQUEAKS) - You mean, we take them back ourselves? (MAGIC RINGING) But if we take them, isn't that stealing? I mean, we can't... Right, they don't belong to him, do they? Well, okay, but... Whoa! Wait, wait! Slow down. We need a plan! (GRUNTS) Ha-ha! Meant to do that. I'm coming! Bye-bye! (GROANING FRUSTRATEDLY) What was it? What was it? Who could have commanded it? Why is there nothing? Mi Rey, what has happened here? I don't know who we're dealing with, and these books are useless! (SIGHS) Just breathe. (GROANS) Do not tell me to breathe. Everything... Everything I do is to make sure that never happens again. And when you're threatened, you do not breathe. You focus. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) (GASPS) To summon such light would demand a spell so powerful... No, you yourself say, "Forbidden magic is not the way." A king must be prepared to do anything to protect his kingdom. (SOFT WHOOSHING) (SIGHS) First, you must protect yourself. That's what I'm doing. Not like this. We know nothing of these pages. You command great magic. But with this book, I fear it commanding you. Please, put that book down. (SOFT CRACKLE) (BOTH SIGH) If you want answers about the light, I suggest you look to your people. - They love you. - I know. They would do anything for you. KING MAGNIFICO: Of course they would. You are their handsomest, most beloved king. You're right. - I am a handsome king. - (CHUCKLES) Oh, my love, excellent advice. Rosas is so lucky to have you. As am I. (SIGHS IN RELIEF) Everything is fine. - (ASHA GRUNTING) - (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Can you stop squiggling, please? You're drawing attention. Hi. Hello. - You know, I'm just gonna... - (MAN GASPS) - CHILD: What's in the bag? - (CROWD EXCLAIMS) (ASHA PANTING) (SOLDIER YAWNS) (DOOR CREAKING) - (EXHALES) Okay. - (CHICKENS CLUCKING) You can come out now. - (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYS) - Oh. Are those pajamas? Ah! Thank you. I feel seen. (BLOWS) Okay, focus. I need to talk to Dahlia. There has to be a way to sneak into the King's study. (OBJECTS CLATTERING) (SQUEALS) Without anyone seeing you. Yes, yes. I'm way ahead of you. Star may alarm the masses. - Much like a talking goat. - What? Which is why you're both staying here. - (STAR SQUEAKS) - With the chickens? Did you see what just came out of that one's... I'll be right back. Stay quiet. (STAR SQUEAKS) - (GABO SCOFFS) - HAL: Come on. Even you have to admit, Gabo, that light last night felt amazing. (CHUCKLES) It was probably a curse. - Cookies. - Cookies. No! This batch is for the King! (LAUGHS) A squirrel just said "Good morning" to me. I have no response to that. I didn't either. Right? I mean, what do you say to a squirrel? - (TAKES DEEP BREATH) - (MUFFLED WHOOSH) (GASPS) (CHICKENS CLUCKING) Oh! I really have to watch where I'm going. You touch 'em, you wash 'em. - It was an accident. - (GABO SHRIEKS) How? How do you always do that? (CHUCKLES COYLY) Hey, how are you and your poor Saba this morning? - Oh, uh, coping. - Hmm. And curious. How do the kitchens get food up to the King? Oh, um, the formal servers bring his meals to the dining room. - (MUFFLED WHOOSHING) - (VALENTINO LAUGHS) (LAUGHING LOUDLY) So, what about when the King eats in his study? - What? - Who brings it then? Well, his study is off-limits. (CLEARS THROAT) (SOFTLY) Details are known to only a select few. Including you? - No comment. - (GASPS) - VALENTINO: Ladies, please. - Who is in there? I don't hear anything. Dahlia, if you know a secret way into the King's study, you have to tell me. Why? What is going on with you? - (SNEEZES) - Whoa! Wait, wait, wait, wait. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) What are you doing? I... I gotta collect eggs. No! I mean, let me. I'll do it for you. Nah, that's okay, Asha. But your allergies! All that sneezing. That can't be good for you. Are you trying to take the chickens away from me? You know Safi loves those chickens. - I do. - Are you okay, Asha? Something's up with you. - What are you hiding? - Oh! Nothing. VALENTINO: Life is to be lived! And nobody. - What is going on in there? - Why are you all sweaty? You can tell us anything. Move or we break the door down! No, no, no, no. Fine. Fine! (SIGHS) Last night, after everything happened, I made a wish... on a star. What are you, five? And the star answered. - (LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING) - (CHICKENS CLUCK RHYTHMICALLY) That's it, ladies. Your wings can't fly but your voices can! (CHICKEN BEATBOXING) (CHICKENS WHOOPING) (RHYTHMIC CLUCKING CONTINUES) Okay, ladies, big finish! (CHICKENS CLUCKING OUTRO) - (MUSIC ENDS) - (ALL GASPING) - (SAFI INHALES SHARPLY) - (ASHA CHUCKLES) - (STAR SQUEAKS) - (DARIO CHUCKLES) These are my friends. - (STAR SQUEAKS) - Oh! (LAUGHING) This is objectively impossible. - (CHUCKLING) - (SAFI SNEEZES) (LAUGHS) - (CHUCKLES) - (STAR SHRIEKS) What? Why am I making you sad? - (STAR SQUEAKS) - Oh. Simon's 18. He's already given his wish to the King. Huh. I can't remember what I lost. - (STAR SQUEAKS) - Oh. GABO: Don't accept it. (SHRIEKS) No. Stay away. No, no, no, no! Am I the only one who realizes this is gonna end very badly? Not if everyone keeps quiet about Star. Magic is forbidden by anyone other than Magnifico, (SHRIEKING) who is also the only one authorized (SHRIEKS) to grant wishes. Self-authorized. Wait. Does Star grant wishes? No, but I think it wants to help me pursue mine. Like a fairy godmother. Life is not a fairytale. - Whoa! - (CHICKEN CLUCKING) What did you wish for? No, you know what? (BABBLING) Don't tell us. I want no part of this. (FANFARE PLAYING IN DISTANCE) That's the King's call to assemble. Uh... Please, Magnifico can't know about Star. And I promise, my wish won't harm or affect any of you. Or Rosas. (STAR SQUEAKS) That's a big promise, Asha. But we trust you. Don't we, Bazee... Where did she go? - How does she do that? - (SAFI SNIFFLES) It's okay. We won't tell anyone, Asha. Right. (WHISPERS) About the chickens. We got you. Right, Gabo? I don't squeal. - What are you not telling me? - Okay. Okay. Yesterday, I kind of challenged the King. - What? - It's, uh, complicated. - And? - (GROANS SOFTLY) Dahlia, what would you do if you found out the wishes of those you love with all your heart will never be granted? You mean your Saba's wish. And, thanks to me, my mother's. (SIGHS) I'm here to get their wishes, so I can give them back to them. You're here to steal from the King? It's not stealing. The wishes don't belong to him. And you can't just - ask Magnifico for them back? - (SIGHS) I think I've ruined my chances of asking Magnifico for anything. This is how we get food to the King's study. (CHUCKLES DELIGHTFULLY) - (CHUCKLES) - It's perfect. (GRUNTS) - A new way to climb! - Okay, look out! - We can't fit. Ugh! - Backing up. Are you sure about this? Magnifico could come back any time. And that's why you're gonna stall him. Please and thank you, best friend ever? How am I supposed to stall a king? You'll think of something. You're a genius! (GASPS) - Ooh. To the left. - Let's go up! I have to reach the pulley-thing. And we ride! I'm sorry, that was right in your ear. (FANFARE CONTINUES PLAYING) - I can't believe that light last night. - That light was amazing... Like nothing I've ever seen. KING MAGNIFICO: Quiet, quiet, quiet! I know you are all wondering about that little light - last night. - (CROWD CHEERING) A light I did not command or condone! - (CHEERING SUBSIDES) - MAN 1: Yeah! - MAN 2: What? - It was magic, though quite clumsy and amateurish. It was also completely forbidden. There is a traitor - amongst us... - (CROWD GASPING) who defied the law. They used magic to put you all at risk! - (CROWD EXCLAIMS) - But don't worry, they are no match for me. And I assure you, - when caught... - (GASPS) they will be punished severely. DAHLIA: (SOFTLY) Asha. - (MUFFLED GRUNTING) - VALENTINO: You are awfully slow at this. - (BELL JINGLES) - ASHA: Shh! I think we're here. VALENTINO: Adventure awaits right outside this door! - ASHA: Let's go. - (RATTLING) - Oh, no. - (RATTLING) No, no, no, no, no. It's locked. VALENTINO: I'll ram it. - (THUD) - (VALENTINO GROANS) It hurts without horns. ASHA: What are you doing? (WHOOSHING) Star, please don't break anything. VALENTINO: Yes, but don't hold back. (BOING) ASHA: What's happening? VALENTINO: Just go all out. Throw magic dust everywhere! It'll be fine. BOTH: Yes! (GASP) - ASHA: No! - (VALENTINO SCREAMS) - (EXPLODES) - (ASHA GASPS) KING MAGNIFICO: Rosas needs you. Any information would be most helpful. And I know you will never, ever let me down. - Thank you. - (CROWD CHEERING) - (MAJESTIC MUSIC PLAYS) - (GASPS) DAHLIA: Your Majesty, wait! Please! - (MUSIC FADES OUT) - Um... (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Yes, go on. Ahem. Okay. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Hi. Hi. Uh... Hi, I'm Dahlia. (CHUCKLES) I make your Magnifico cookies. Fantastic. What can I do for you, Dahlia? (CHUCKLING) Oh. Thank you for asking. (CLEARS THROAT) You said any information would be helpful. - Uh-huh. - But pragmatically speaking, what qualifies? Evidentiary? - How about circumstantial? - (SIGHS) First hand? Ooh, second hand? - What about hunches? - Oh! Sure. How about hunches? Yes, any. Any information about who or what caused the light would be helpful. So, yes, hunch. Hunch away. You said it was amateur magic, but how come you don't know - how they did it? - What? Perhaps you could define "amateur"? - This is about what you know. - (CROWD MURMURING) (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) It is about your safety, and most importantly, the safety of your wishes. Um, do you mean our wishes aren't safe? - Of course they're safe! - (CROWD GASPING) (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) - (ASHA GRUNTS) - (BLOWING) (LAUGHS) Good as new. Whew. Hope he didn't need those. - (STAR SQUEAKS) - (GASPS) Right, the wishes. That's actually a door, and Magnifico waved his hand and it just... (MIMICS WHOOSHING) Okay, how about this? Nothing? Or this? This? Or this? (GROANS FRUSTRATEDLY) - (DUST CHIMES) - (STAR SQUEAKS) - Yes! - VALENTINO: You got it! - Teamwork! - (VALENTINO LAUGHS) (ENTHRALLING MUSIC PLAYING) (SQUEAKING EXCITEDLY) (GIGGLES) (SQUEAKING IN DELIGHT) Star, I'm glad you are having fun, but you have to focus. Please, find my Saba's and mother's wishes as fast as you can! (SQUEALS) - (STAR GASPS) - (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS) How do we know our wishes are safe? We never see them. Why can't we see them? Why is that a rule? And why can't we remember them? One question at a time. Since we're asking, what if we want to change our wish? Good point, wishes can change. Let's form a line, everyone will get a turn. MAN 1: You know what'd comfort us? - Another wish ceremony. - Yeah. It would make us all feel so much better. WOMAN: Please, Your Majesty! MAN 2: We could do it now! No! Not now! Bad timing! CROWD: (CHANTING) Wishes, wishes, wishes! - (LOUDLY) Silence! - (CROWD GOES QUIET) Is that all you can think about? A Wish Granting Ceremony? (NERVOUSLY) Mm-hmm. (BREATHES HEAVILY) Fine. Whoever identifies the traitor, your wish will be granted! - (CROWD CHEERING) - What? But hear this! Anyone who helps the traitor, anyone who lets me down, your wish will never be granted! (CROWD EXCLAIMS AND MURMURS) DAHLIA: Wait! Your Majesty... Enough! How brazenly they question me! They only question you because you make them feel safe enough to do so. I'll be with the wishes. Disturb me with nothing but good news. - (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) - (GROANING FRUSTRATEDLY) (GROANS ANGRILY) (SINGING)♪ I can't help it ♪ ♪ if mirrors love my face ♪ ♪ It's genetics ♪ ♪ Yeah, I got these ♪ ♪ genes from outer space ♪ ♪ Peep the name, I'm magnificent ♪ ♪ I put the "I" in omnipotent ♪ ♪ I'm passionate, I'm not petulant ♪ Someone praise me for my benevolence (CLEARS THROAT) Just look (CHUCKLES) ♪ I'd give the clothes ♪ ♪ off Benito's back ♪ ♪ If you really needed that ♪ ♪ I'd be the first ♪ ♪ one to volunteer ♪ ♪ - Henry ♪ - (HENRY GRUNTS) ♪ If your home were to crumble ♪ ♪ Or if you were in trouble ♪ - (CHEERS) ♪ - I let you live here for free ♪ ♪ And I don't even charge you rent ♪ ♪ I clean up all your messes ♪ ♪ And I'm always there ♪ ♪ when you need to vent ♪ ♪ I give and give ♪ ♪ and give and give ♪ (CHUCKLING) ♪ You'd think ♪ ♪ they'd all be content ♪ ♪ And all I really want ♪ ♪ is just a little respect ♪ ♪ And this is the thanks I get ♪ MALE CHORUS: ♪ Dah dah dah dah ♪ ♪ Dah dah dah dah dah dah dah ♪ ♪ This is the thanks I get ♪ ♪ Dah dah dah dah Dah ♪ ♪ dah dah dah dah dah dah ♪ ♪ And this is the thanks I get ♪ ♪ Dah dah dah dah Dah ♪ ♪ dah dah dah dah dah dah ♪ ♪ And this is the thanks I get ♪ ♪ Dah dah dah dah Dah ♪ ♪ dah dah dah dah dah dah ♪ ♪ You're so brilliant ♪ ♪ Oh, that's the ♪ ♪ least you could say ♪ ♪ There's more, admit it ♪ ♪ You're cute and strong ♪ ♪ And bold and brave Thanks! ♪ ♪ See this kingdom, I built it up ♪ ♪ And you still complain? ♪ ♪ Ungrateful much? ♪ Mmm, are you sure that you're not the prob? ♪ I'd love to see you ♪ ♪ try and do my job ♪ ♪ Oh-ho! ♪ ♪ I granted 14 wishes last year ♪ ♪ Come on, that's a high percent ♪ ♪ And now you're ♪ ♪ questioning your king? ♪ ♪ The disrespect I just underwent ♪ ♪ You know, I always got your back ♪ ♪ Yeah, really though, ♪ ♪ it's no sweat ♪ ♪ Since the day you were born ♪ ♪ and the day that we met ♪ ♪ - And this is the thanks ♪ ♪ I get - Dah dah dah dah ♪ ♪ - Dah dah dah dah dah ♪ ♪ dah dah - (STAR YELPS) ♪ ♪ This is the thanks I get ♪ ♪ Dah dah dah dah Dah ♪ ♪ dah dah dah dah dah dah ♪ ♪ And this is the thanks I get ♪ ♪ Dah dah dah dah Dah ♪ ♪ dah dah dah dah dah dah ♪ ♪ And this is the thanks I get ♪ ♪ Dah dah dah dah Dah ♪ ♪ dah dah dah dah dah dah ♪ ♪ I didn't wanna do this I ♪ ♪ swore I'd never do this ♪ ♪ But I'm hypnotized by ♪ ♪ how these pages flip ♪ ♪ 'Cause I refuse to ♪ ♪ have my power stripped ♪ ♪ A potion, a spell, ♪ ♪ a summon, a curse? ♪ ♪ Anything to make ♪ ♪ that light reverse ♪ ♪ To this book I don't ♪ ♪ want to be tethered ♪ ♪ But desperate times call ♪ ♪ for desperate measures ♪ (TRILLS LIPS) Where was I?

Because, like all goats, I believe the greater the challenge we are willing to face, - the greater the life we live. - Uh... Oh, whoa! Saba, I know you said you didn't want to know a wish that could never be. But now, you can make it be. SABINO: It's so simple, so pure. Asha, I know you think you're doing a good thing, but... I should never have given Magnifico my wish. This... (BREATHING HEAVILY) This belongs to me. (SIGHS IN RELIEF) (WHOOSHING) (CHUCKLES) (EXHALES SHARPLY, CHUCKLES) Saba... Oh, Asha, I may never actually inspire anybody, but now at least I have the chance to try. I'm going back for your wish next, Mama. - (DOOR OPENS) - (BOTH GASP) - (DOOR CREAKS) - (BOTH GASP) That's right, Asha. You've been turned in. Where is it? Where is the star? There's nothing here for you! How did you do it, huh? What sorcery did you use? I know no sorcery. You ripped a star from the sky and used it to steal from me. ASHA: The wishes don't belong to you. You were never going to grant my Saba's wish. And he deserves to have it back. - They all deserve... - I told you, I decide what they deserve. Please, Your Majesty. She made a mistake. She won't do it again. Oh, I know she won't. Does this feel familiar, - Sakina? - (GASPS) My wish. Yes, your wish that you gave to me for safekeeping, because we all know what happens to wishes out in this... this real world. (CHUCKLES) - They get crushed. - (GASPS) - (SHATTERS) - (MOANING IN PAIN) - Mama! - Sakina. No! Ooh, what is this? (GASPS) What a gift. All this time, I've protected the wishes not knowing the power they yield. I feel as if I can do... anything. (GASPS) (SQUEAKS) The star. (GASPS) I must have it. (SAKINA BREATHING HEAVILY) - (ASHA GRUNTS) - (GROANS) Let's go! Now! GUARD 1: What is that? GUARD 2: Hey! - (WHOOSHING) - (GUARDS GRUNTING) - GUARD 2: Is this yarn? - Hurry, hurry. From one domesticated animal to another, help us! (WHINNYING) - (SAKINA MOANS) - ASHA: Careful. That's it, Sakina. Hold on! - VALENTINO: Whoa... - (HORSE WHINNIES) (TENSE MUSIC PLAYING) We've run out of land. There's a boat. Hurry. Go, return to your stables. - If anyone asks, play dumb. - (HORSES NICKER) - I say we head for the islet. - (SAKINA GROANS) It's closest. - We can hide there. - (ASHA GRUNTING) Oh, thank you. - (SAKINA MOANS) - Mama? My heart knows this feeling. This is grief. Oh, I didn't mean for this to happen. (SIGHS) (SIGHS) I know, baby. I was foolish to think I could change anything. I should never have wished. (BREATHES SHAKILY) (ASHA SIGHS) It's true. My wish has ruined everything for my family. And now everyone in Rosas is at risk because of me. (GROANS SOFTLY) Oh, Asha, no. Everyone is at risk because of Magnifico. Our dear Rosas. Your father's heart would break for what we now know. (MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (SIGHS) I know what you're thinking because I'm thinking it, too. - I love you both very much. - What is going on? - When you get to the islet... - SABINO: Asha. - Stay hidden from view. - SAKINA: What are you doing? I have to stop him. - No! - It's too dangerous! I started this. I have to finish it... - (SAKINA GASPS) - for everyone. - Asha! - No! - (ASHA GRUNTS) - I cannot swim! (SAKINA GASPS) Perfect. - Shark! - ASHA: What? No, no. I... I have not seen a shark. I'm just practicing. (SINISTER MUSIC PLAYING) To harness a star... Ooh, a staff. A staff of such power, even the night will bow to my command. (LAUGHS MALICIOUSLY) Perfect. One branch of mountain ash bathed in Tollen's potion. Molten iron for strength, copper for a strike. And most important, the power cast from the innocent hearts of three. You dared to question me and all that I do for you. You don't deserve to be granted. But, through me, you may serve a greater purpose. (ALL SHATTER) - (GASPING) - My love. Such sadness. (GASPS, GRUNTS) (GASPS, MOANS) (DRAMATIC CHORAL MUSIC PLAYING) (LAUGHING MALICIOUSLY) Yes! (LAUGHS) Yes! (LAUGHS) Yes! Amaya, darling, come! Come! (LAUGHING) You're just in time to meet my new toy! (QUEEN AMAYA GASPS) Now, that is power. Am I glowing? I feel as if I am. Yes? How could you? You know the ways of forbidden magic are... Unappreciated. Much like I am by my own people. By that girl. She did this. She pulled a star from the sky to destroy everything I've built. Asha? No, she only wanted her family's wishes back. (GASPS) Do you side with the traitor, Amaya? No. No. You know I would never side with a traitor of Rosas. (GRUNTS) I have believed in you from the moment we met. We built this kingdom together. There is nothing more important than that. Wonderful. Now, let's go set the stage. I'm on the hunt! (LAUGHING) (PLAYING FANFARE) (CROWD MURMURING) (STAR SQUEAKS) You know, all of this is just a bump in the road. A gigantically, humongous bump. (STAR SQUEAKS) We have to find Dahlia and the others. All I see are feet. Look at these poor people! Asha stole and destroyed their wishes. She must pay! They say her family's gone missing. I bet she killed them. This whole thing feels wrong. - (CROWD GASPING) - (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (CROWD EXCLAIMING) (ALL GASPING) (PEOPLE SCREAMING) (LAUGHS) Your faces! (LAUGHS) It's okay. You're okay. - It's just a play on light. - (CROWD CHEERING) You know I love you, Rosas. (SIGHS) The Queen looks scared. - (MOUSE SQUEAKING) - (KING MAGNIFICO CHUCKLES) KING MAGNIFICO: Okay, okay, enough play. (STAR SQUEAKS) I think we're thinking the same thing - again. - (DING) W-W-Wait, discreetly! You are all probably wondering why you are here. Yes, there's a savage teenager running around with a star, destroying wishes. But... guess who bravely came forward and identified her. Give a big cheer for - Simon O'Donohue! - (CROWD CHEERING) - (GROUP GASPS) - Simon? (CHUCKLING) I know, I know! Tell me, I was as surprised as you all. Our sleepy little Simon here. - No need to be nervous, Simon. - (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Be proud! Show us your joy! - Your Majesty? - Oh, my. I know, a talking mouse, but don't panic. I'm very clean, and I have an important message for you. (CLEARS THROAT) "You once said, 'Generosity is the true essence of Rosas.' "I can see your fear, "but Rosas needs your help now. "Love, Asha." The "love" part was my idea. (CHUCKLES) Okay. Bye. So, my dear Simon, are you ready to see your wish? (GASPS) To be the King's most valiant, courageous, and loyal knight! Just not a loyal friend. It is my great pleasure to grant you your heart's desire. (CROWD GASPING) (GASPING) - (SIMON GRUNTS) - (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) (CHUCKLING) (GRUNTS, GROANS) (ALL GASPING) (BOTH GRUNT) (SIMON GROANS) (HEROIC MUSIC PLAYS) Long live the King! - CROWD: Long live the King! - (GASPS) (CHUCKLES) Oh, isn't that wonderful? There are six more traitors, Your Majesty. Dahlia, Gabo, Dario, Safi, Hal and Bazeema. Find them, so they may pay for their betrayal. Find Asha, so you may be rewarded. But most importantly, find me that star, so I will have the power to grant all of your wishes! (CROWD CHEERING) (ASHA PANTING) (TENSE MUSIC PLAYING) (GASPS) It's a dead end. A dead end with un-sanded mahogany. (CHUCKLES) - (WOOD SNAPS) - (SHRIEKS) Oh! Good find, Valentino. My butt found it. GABO: Whoa! So, this is where you go when you sneak off, huh, Bazeema? Thanks for keeping it all to yourself. Introverts deserve sanctuary. (CHUCKLES) I'm happy for you. (CHUCKLES) We're safe here. No, we're not safe anywhere. We're fugitives, thanks to Asha. She said she just wanted her family to have their wishes back. Oh, and you believed her? - It's the truth, Gabo. - (GASPS) - (GASPS) Hide! - GABO: We're all gonna die! Oh! Hey, Asha. (GRUNTS) Please say you didn't destroy... - (GROUP GASPS) - those people's wishes? Of course I didn't. It was Magnifico. (SCOFFS) Likely story. Wait, the King was acting awfully, awfully... (INHALES) Awful. Simon looked like he was in pain. GABO: Yeah, right before he snitched on us. (SNEEZES) We're doomed! Not if we fight.

He is intent on capturing Star. He wants to take all of your energy for himself. Then Star needs to leave, like, right now. No, no. If anyone's leaving, it's gonna be you. Star won't go until those wishes are free. Does that mean you have a plan? - (STAR SQUEAKS) - Of course we have a plan. KING MAGNIFICO: Oh! Fantasyland in the sky, huh? - How about Neverland? - (SHATTERS) The perfect nanny for your horrible children? Poppin' this one! - (SHATTERS) - (LAUGHING) Oh! True love, how sweet. - (SHATTERS) - (GRUNTS) So much for true love. (GRUNTS) - (LAUGHING) - QUEEN AMAYA: Mi Rey! Asha and Star have been spotted in the forest. Is that so? How fortunate. (BREATHES SHAKILY) Shall we gather the citizens, so they can see you capture her? Oh, we've been gathering them a lot lately, don't you think? - I, um... - Oh, I'm kidding! - (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) - Sound the trumpets, Amaya. I'll bring back the girl and the star! (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS) Okay. We must work quickly. (LOUDLY) And quietly! I'll lead Magnifico as far away as possible. And as soon as he leaves the castle, you go help the others free the wishes. - (SQUEAKS) - (ASHA GRUNTS) I know, okay? (CHUCKLES) I'm worried, too. - (SQUEAKS) - Wait. What are you doing? Oh, a stick. - (DING) - Okay. What do I do with this? Oh! Ha! It's magic. - Thank you. - (HORSE WHINNIES) You have to go. Go now. Okay. I can do this. (GRUNTS) What? (GRUNTS) (GROANS) Come on, come on, come on, pl... (SHRIEKS) Okay. (PANTING) Good luck, Asha! (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) - (GRUNTS) - (HORSE WHINNIES) Challenge accepted. - (GRUNTS) - (HORSE WHINNIES) SAFI: Wow. HAL: Hi. - BAZEEMA: Whoa! - (HAL GASPS) Through the heart we understand the world. - Oh, look, hot drinks. - Nah-uh-uh. - (STAR SQUEAKS) - Star! You're here! Oh, thank goodness! This is it, everyone. First we open the roof, and then Star returns the wishes. The Queen said we need to look for giant pulleys. Maybe these pulleys? Start climbing! As my mother always said, "If someone falls, "leave them!" (GRUNTS) No, buddy, we're not doing that. You can come back 'cause I... I hate heights. - (ALL EXCLAIM) - Oh, nice! - (ALL LAUGHING) - HAL: And away we go! SAFI: Wow. GABO: Oh, this is high. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (GRUNTS) (HORSE WHINNIES) (BREATHES SHARPLY, GRUNTS) (WHOOSHING) (CHUCKLES SHEEPISHLY) - (GROWLS) - (HORSE WHINNIES) (GRUNTS) Here. Obsidian oil for protection from the pages. This reads like a recipe book for the foul and the savage. Look for anything on how to break his staff, bind his magic, or at the very least, break the hold it has on him. - (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) - (ASHA PANTING) (YELPING SOFTLY) (GRUNTS) I don't get you at all! - (ALL STRAINING) - (PULLEY CREAKING) It won't move! I'm trying my hardest. Hey, Dario, buddy! It's called a pulley for a reason! This is no time for riddles! Come on. It's as obvious as my baby beard. You must pull together. On my count. One. Two. - Nine zillyboo. - (GASPS) Twenty alphabet. - Wait, what? - (SIGHS) I... I can't count. Now! (ALL GRUNT) That's it. Give it all you've got! (STRAINING, GRUNTS) - (ALL STRAINING) - (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) - (STAR GRUNTS) - GABO: No! Oh, he's become practically untouchable. No metal can break his staff. No spell can bind his magic. And no one can bring him back from this. "Embrace forbidden magic just once, "and you commit to it for eternity." - (GRUNTS) - (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (ASHA GRUNTING WEAKLY) Whoa! I can't turn, I can't turn, I can't turn! Whoa, I can't stop staring. Work for me, stick. Oh! (GRUNTS) STAG: Oh, dear. - (HORSE WHINNIES) - (ASHA YELLING SHAKILY) (GRUNTS FRUSTRATEDLY) - We need more weight! - Hmm. Well, it's not falling if you jump.

(ALL LAUGHING IN DELIGHT) MAN 1: Are those our wishes? MAN 2: They must be. WOMAN: Oh, the wishes are free. The wishes. She's freeing them. Our girl. Come on. Saba, you're 100 years old. But my will is strong. Yeah-ha! (CHUCKLES) They did it! - (HORSE WHINNIES) - (SHRIEKS, GRUNTING) - (KING MAGNIFICO GRUNTS) - No! (PANTING) (KING MAGNIFICO CHUCKLES) It doesn't matter. You're too late. Asha, Magnifico's never too late. Simon? (GASPS) Star! (PANTING) - (GRUNTS, LAUGHS) - (GRUNTS) You really think you can take me? (SIMON SCREAMING) (SIMON GASPING) - (GROWLS) - ASHA: Thanks, John! Any time, Asha! (SHRIEKS) - Please don't hurt me. - (LAUGHS) It's not me you should be afraid of. - Boom! - (SCREAMING) (SCREAMING CONTINUES IN DISTANCE) (CROWD GASPING IN AWE) (ALL LAUGHING HAPPILY) (CAPTIVATING MUSIC PLAYING) - (BOOM) - (STAR SQUEAKS) (PANTING) Star! Hyah! (CROWD EXCLAIMING) (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING) (CHUCKLES) Surprise. (GRUNTS SOFTLY) (MUFFLED WHOOSHING) (CHUCKLING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) Good evening, Rosas! (KING MAGNIFICO'S VOICE ECHOING) (CHUCKLES) Wow, the stars are out tonight. Oh, except for you. You're trapped now, aren't you? (CHUCKLES) But you see, what can I say? I really, really don't like being betrayed. - (CROWD GASPING) - It is you who betrays your people! Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope. I've had enough of you. - (GASPS, GRUNTS) - (CROWD EXCLAIMS) HAL: Your Majesty! Your little trick didn't work, Amaya. I still got what I wanted. What's this? The wishes aren't yours to free. They are mine! Now, bow down to your king! Star, get away from there! (GRUNTS) - No! (GRUNTS) - (CROWD EXCLAIMS) Asha! (ASHA YELPING) Well, hello, Asha. So glad you could join us. How's the whole "taking your wish into your own hands" working out for you? - Oh, wait. - (GRUNTING) I don't actually care. - (CLINKING) - Hello, there. - Let's do this! - Star! (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING) - (GASPS) - (STAR SQUEAKS) No! (CROWD EXCLAIMS) Yes. (WHIMPERS) (LAUGHS) Mirrors, mirrors on the wall, who is the handsomest? Me! No! - I win. - (CROWD GASPING) (SIGHS) Wishes really do come true. You don't deserve Star! I told you, I decide! (ASHA GRUNTS) - (GRUNTS, LAUGHS) - (ASHA GROANS) - (CONTINUES LAUGHING) - (PANTING) - Oh! No, you don't! - (GROANS WEAKLY) There will be no wishing on stars ever again! (TENSE MUSIC PLAYING) In fact, there will be no more hope, no more dreams, and no escape. (LAUGHING MALICIOUSLY) - (PANICKED SHOUTING) - MAN: Run! (GRUNTS) (GASPING) KING MAGNIFICO: No chance to rise up. - No one to tell any tales. - (PEOPLE GRUNTING) No one to challenge me ever again! (GRUNTING WEAKLY) You... are... nothing!
