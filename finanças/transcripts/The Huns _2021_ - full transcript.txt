[thunder rumbling] - [Narrator] Revenge is only the very beginning. [dramatic music] Savage tribes fought brutal wars over their lands, and it seemed never ending. They were cruel people and called themselves Hunu, they were also nomads who never stayed put. They took whatever they wanted whenever they wanted and never relented. - Abhar, tie her up so she doesn't run away, and be sure to make it tight. [horse neighs] - Listen, and I'll tell you a story of yore, be sure to pay attention. It all began one day, many moons back, when the cold wind was blowing. I remember it very well, how could I not? Strong warriors sat next to the fire to warm themselves. I look at the fire even now. It tells only the truth. This is a very long story. I think the time has come for me to tell it to you. I hope you will understand. On that night it all happened this way as I know it. - I'll say that I'm as hungry today as a pack of wild dogs. - [Man] Yeah, me too. [men giggling] - It was a very fast and glorious fight today, that's how it should be. - Now, it's time to celebrate our victory. We'll pay our respect to the dead for the cause. [men chanting] - It seems like the younger one lost control of his axe today. If it wasn't for whores, no one would stop it. - That's for sure - [Man] Tanai, are you sure this one is your brother? - [Man 2] He is so stupid that he had better wise up. - [Man] And he knows you should be. - You should be the youngest. - Yeah, junior, he brought such shame on himself. - Do I amuse you or something? What, no more laughing. [man gasping] - What are you gonna do with your big mouth now? [man gasping] You'll dare to say those things behind my back. What, now you got nothing to say to me. You're a bunch of cowards. Got nothing to say? Go away, everyone. Who do you think you're looking at, my brother? Look at this dirt you see before you. Tomorrow she'll burn at the stake. Yes, that is the fate that awaits her. We go. That's good. That's very good. [thunder rumbles] Hey. Who goes there? Answer me. Come out. Reveal yourself to me. Sky, why are you playing with me? I can feel you. Sky, you know what I'm up to. I know there's no fooling you, Sky. I can't hide it from you. my brother, he will be injured, oh, such a plan, my plan. Can you hear that? Sky, guide my path, talk to me because I've been waiting for this day for such a long time. You already know how I want to get into my enemy's den at night. In every winter, I continue to stretch out my hands, yes, and out towards you to look for an answer but why are you silent again? You must give me these answers. Come on, answer me. Show me your good graces. Say something, tell me anything. Say something, tell me anything. Just gimme a sign. So here I am, I'm like a wounded wolf. Have I gone mad speaking to myself? Very well. [Tanai shouts] You are the last member of your clan. So the question is, what do you think I should do with you? Well, speak up, answer me. - Tanai, the chief of the guard was killed. He was killed by our people. It's true, it was your brother. I don't trust him, I don't. [dramatic music] - Remember, you hadn't been born yet. The cold winds began to blow. Prey for everyone became scarce and something had to be done about it. The darkness tells what happened next. Near the fire and the ashes. [door creaking] [crickets chirping] - What are you doing? - I'm trying to free you'd If you let me. - What will your brother say? - He's not my brother. - Are you sure? But he'll never forgive you. - You're free now, you can leave - But what are we supposed to do now? - We need to move quickly. Hurry up, let's go. Let's go, hurry up. Come on, hurry up. Come on, hurry up, I said. Let's go. - Oh, but what happened next? You ask me, sitting there a story about revenge it's deep in our nature to act and react in spite of the sky. And this is a tale of revenge and spite. It's true that everyone always wants to be in charge. Always. Everyone thinks that they are the strongest, but how can that even be possible? However, this may not always be the case. Go and fetch me that stone girl. It has great power. [suspenseful music] - They were just here. Let's get them! [ritual music] [foxes howling] [dramatic music] [men chanting] - Tanai, all our horsemen are killed, they're all gone. I saw it myself, but I managed to escape. - Tell me what happened. - Your brother is with her, but he is unconscious. - Explain yourself, how is that possible? - She killed them all, everyone. - Yet you stand before me. Unharmed without a scratch. Tell me why didn't she kill you too, coward? Let him go. He can still be useful to us. We all make mistakes in this life, but you can thank me for sparing the pathetic one you have. Will you be grateful to your gods if I let you go? Go now as if nothing happened. Get out now, I want you to prepare for battle. I'll show everyone what war actually is. [Hora grunting] - You could have left by now, why did you stay here? - I can decide for myself. You need not worry. [suspenseful music] - We must hurry. - Show me where. Show me the wound. It can get much worse over time. We should get going. - No, wait, I must rest. - Let's go. - You see, no man had been this far before and the vast plains were covered with grass. They kept on their journey without stopping. No one could know anything about it or how it could end up and what awaited the cautious fugitives. The best trackers were sent after them, though being careful not to be seen. They easily found their food. However, Kile was badly injured. Tanai wounded him quite severely. Wild horses are as fast as the forceful wind. It's very similar to wind in the step. Many wounds never completely heal, they just keep on bleeding and always leave a scar. Nobody knows exactly how they survived but power is inside us, always. The sky gives us the strength to understand nature itself. We must remember to always listen to the sky. This is life as we know it. Life is always much more important than death, for the sky will always be waiting. So now you understand everything. - We have to move on, it's time to go. [Kile grunting] This is the place, we've arrived. - Strangers, on guard, take cover. - They won't shoot, don't worry. It is forbidden. These archers here are said to be the best. [water running] - Look. Well, speak up then. - I am Kile, banished by my brother. I am the son of Ramire of the Step. - And who are you? - My name is Hora. - I know this one very well, daughter of her father. I would kill your father if he were here. Tell me immediately why you're here. Well, why are you here? - My father Asgad, he's been dead a long time. - No, I'm far too old to believe in any of this nonsense, for that, I will send you to your ancestors for this lie you tell me - Enough of that Kot, can't you see they are injured. Besides, you know the law of the Step very well. - Let me decide their fate, you just stay out of it, you hear me? - No Kot, our law clearly says, it says that everyone has the right to be under the protection of the Sky for five moons. You know this already Kot and they are our guests now. - You're very lucky. - You know, the law of the Step is the same for all. And the law of the Step applies, especially to you. I have made my decision, now get them out of here, Kot. - I'll be sure to keep my eye out for you. You will show yourself. [dramatic music] [Kile grunting] [dramatic music] - Ekna, tell me what do you see in the flame of the fire now? - I'm looking at the flames now, as I'm looking, I see a vivid illustration here. Kile is in the darkness. Yes, he is on a thin path leading to nowhere. Meanwhile, though his fire sees him and burns at the same time. Just like a snake, just like a snake, but nobody sees his path. It's covered with such darkness. The wound is much too serious. - Is that all? I demand that you explain to me what this wound means, Ekna? - Naturally, I know you've taken the hard path for yourself. There is fear lurking in your darkness, but there is another path ahead of death itself. You must remember that everyone on has their own path, never forget that. We must never forget that. We must listen to the quiet that currently surrounds us. Yes, listen to the quiet for it has the answers to all your fears. Only the sky reveals the rays. - Ekna, yes, of course, I saw the sky revealing its mystery at dawn. - Yes, now I know what answer to give you, my answer is that you have to decide what you want by yourself. Just feel it as it comes to you. But know that death is always near those who actively desire it. It is just like those who happen to treat it like a mother treats her child, yes. Like a mother treats her child. Not only are you leading yourself into a trap, but you also see nothing but death itself while falling into that very trap. I hope you think about it when looking at the fire. It always speaks the truth no matter what, and it always reveals the path. - Go now. [thunder rumbling] [fire crackling] - I see you, oh, I see you wise Kai Rakmana. And yet during the long never ending winters we all realize just how important it is to maintain the balance of life. And soon we will all be able to unite together for it will bring peace to all the clans which means that in due time everyone can join us. Let's recognize all this is thanks to Kai Rakmana. And as a token of my appreciation, I will make a gift. These are stones and there are no such stones in the lands of Kai Rakmana. They carry the knowledge of the whole entire earth. And on my land, we always listen to wise advice. Look at these stones here. They're unique. And so pure. These stones are absolutely worthy. In fact, I'd say they are like you. These stones are worthy of Kai Rakmana. And more, let me make you a personal gift as a sign of genuine friendship as proof. Look at these. These are war mountain furs and they sparkle. They're color sparkled brightly in the sun. They're a gift, you see, worthy of a queen. Accept my gift, please. - I accept your gift. - I acknowledge this [ritual music] - I want to get out of here now. [ritual music] [man speaking in foreign language] [Hora moaning] [man speaking in foreign language] - Are you awake? - I've been awake for some time. Today's the duel. - And do you think they'll leave anyone alive - By the law of the Step, the winner will be able to leave the camp. - This was destined to happen, we cannot change anything - After all, we've had five moons. - I understand, but you can leave now. - I can always make my own decisions. I decide for myself - We will surely die - In that case, we'll each go our separate ways - As you wish [dramatic music] - Many winters will pass until I see you. I appreciate what you've done for us. On behalf of the Hunu tribe, I thank you for the opportunity to pass through your lands. We will not forget this. Good bye. [horse neighs] [Kahn groans] [suspenseful music] [arrows whooshing] [woman groans] - There is the law of the Step and this particular law says the following: "You can't kill an unarmed man inside the camp on a whim and you can't kill him if he's already badly wounded." It's known that only on the fifth moon, can he be called out for his offense, that is what's fair. - I Kogan the son of Harran is now demanding death. - His blood must spill. - His blood must spill for Kan. - His blood spelled. - Death, death. - That's right! His blood shall wet the earth. [horse neighs] [water running] - Oh, they're already here. It looks like we're talking now. Filthy scum. Greetings to you today. Is that really you, Kai Rakmana? - You think you can just come in here and act like you own the place. - I'm guessing that you are Kot who'd better keep quiet if he knows what's good for him. - If I were you I'd think long and hard before you say something in my presence. - Oh, then should we turn to the skies for judgment on this decision, and before speaking out of turn? You should know that I have the right of blood to call my brother out in a duel. After that, I have no problem killing this girl like a vile jackal. It seems to me that you all have forgotten the law of the Step. You should know this already Kot that only I and no one else in all the land own the life of my brother and the life of this fugitive here, Kai Rakmana. I will have you know, this girl killed two of my warriors and now she pretends to be weak. - You're the one who let jackals into your home. - What jackal are you talking about exactly? Are you talking about the one that cut the throats of my two strongest warriors? That must be the one that you mean. Only a huntress acts this way. - Don't say that, she can't even hold the bow correctly. - No, but I'm certain she's not who she says that she is. Does not one of you believe me? You're buying what this girl has to say? - Tanai, you will stop now, there's only one Kai Rakmana. And these here are my lands. The only one who decides here is me. - You're wrong, and you have lost all your power. Once you started arranging things you shouldn't have with the men from the north and by trading with them. You're no queen. She is a fool, Kot. - So what's going to happen to us now? - It was destined by the Sky. - It was dusted by the Sky - That may be, but we must avenge the death of Kahn. We really need to attack, tomorrow is the duel. - So be it, there will be a fight. - We must get our revenge. - So then we'll get revenge. - You know, I wasn't always like this, time has passed for all of us. Somewhere in the past, there is another version of me. I felt like I was speaking to the Sky at all hours of the day. You see back then I had so much power, so much power. So many things remain hidden in the night. They can't be understood. These things are not revealed to everyone. [man grunting] - I see you. - I came to see you as you had asked. - You came to see me just like I asked you to. - What was so important that you called me so urgently? - I can really feel these stone. Now I know what's hidden. It has been shown to me. I see a hand here. She's with us here. You are where the wind of Step is. This hand you feel is what holds a baby. And that means that the Sky will give a new life. It's inevitable. I think you need to choose a husband. Oh yes, it's imperative, no doubt about it, Tanai. - But that's impossible. - Hear my words. You heard me, didn't you? - Okay, so let him prove himself in a duel. I will give him that opportunity. - I'm grateful that you decided to be wise and to listen to me, Kai Rakmana. - Go ahead, you may speak. - Considering we're from two incredibly great clans it would be beneficial for us to unite with you. - Oh, so you have made a decision for me already then Tanai? - You should have a strong man by your side to protect you. - I require time to think. - I'll win the fight and I will kill my brother. Then I will be able to stay here with you. - It is your choice, you know - With confidence, my warriors catch pray better than Kahn. They can also offer a lot more too. - But as you know, my clan has its own laws. - Tomorrow I can announce my offer for all to hear. - You should worry about the duel first then we can see what you offer. - You must agree to what I'm saying because it will bring peace to both our clans. - You don't make decisions in my house. - We can bring the two clans together, what do you say? One United clan, there will be more hunting grounds and fur. I promise you that, I guarantee tomorrow's fight will decide everything, you will see. - The result of the fight will decide everything. - I hope for the sake of the clans you'll make the right decision tomorrow. I await the news. - As I already mentioned before, people do what they want. They kill on the spot leaving their hearts thoroughly empty. It's a dark time for everyone. Revenge turns their minds black and leads absolutely nowhere. Lies are unpredictable. After all, it's always empty. [dramatic music] [man speaking in foreign language] [ritual music] [man speaking in foreign language] [man speaking in foreign language] - Before this Sky tonight I announce the very beginning of our clan's duel. Everyone prepare yourselves, we'll all drink fiery grapes, we'll all drink them now. [suspenseful music] - I hate everyone here who's before us, they destroyed my clan. - I've decided who's going to choose first. It's going to be Kile. - Kile of the Step will now make his choice. - Very well, I pick Tanai. - Now we swear on blood, it is life for life. - It's my turn, and I pick you Kot. - So be it, I will tear you apart like prey. You will taste death by my sword. Get up! [suspenseful music] [warriors chanting] [dramatic music] [indistinct chatter] [weapons clanging] - Get her! [dramatic suspenseful music] [women screaming] [fighters grunting] - Are you ready to die now, Kot? [fighters grunting] Anything goes and war isn't fair. I'm taking this because it's rightfully mine. Don't you dare die on me not until I let you die, you hear me? This is my revenge. You are going to feel what I feel, I promise. This is how it ends for you. - Hello there sister. I served tonight for over two years. What was all this for anyway? - Don't you see? They're all dead. Aren't they? Now it is your time to die. It just so happens that I'm afraid to keep a jackal like you around. [dramatic music] - I look at you before me as a reflection of your mother, but fear not your time will come. You already know though, don't you? Your mother is horror. Everything will begin to change. Soon you will lead nations. Come over here now and take this sword from me.
