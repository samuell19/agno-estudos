Previously on "Bear Grylls Survival School," Azriel showedhis star potential, helping to raise morale in camp. Strong stomachs were needed for my lunchtime challenge, with live mealworms on the menu. Oh, I-- oh. Asthe Welsh heavens opened, Alana and Savannah achievedthe near impossible, making a fire from scratch-- High five. I know, yeah. --helping the girls' team take a 2, 1 lead over the boys. Well done, girls. And the team completed survival training, inpreparation for a grueling two day expedition. Next time you do it, it's for real. I'm Bear Grylls. And when I was growing up, all of this was my playground. I want to find out if kidstoday have got what it takes to abandon their mobilephones and survive for two weeks out here in the wild. Woo! Watch out! You made it. You made it. I really don't want to do this. Dig deep, finish strong. Oh! Welcome to "Bear Grylls Survival School." BEAR GRYLLS Coming up-- Oh, pff-- --I create a stink. You haven't lived until you've had a sniff of somebody's boiling pee. Leaping into the unknown-- It is a sheer drop into the abyss. --andsurvival school gets very real. Listen, this is aproper survival situation. Over the next twodays, the young survivors are going to be an awfullylong way from their base camp. Right out in the wild, they're going to have to be resourceful, positive, and determined, as well as dealing withthe infamous Welsh weather. But before they set out, I want to demonstrate how theycan make use of almost anything in a survival situation. OK, come and jump up on the bank up here. Even their wee. OK, listen in. Tonight you guys are going to be living off military ration packs, OK, which is a food that soldiers eat. They come in these littlefoil pouches, like this. And it is good to go. Literally, you can eat it straight like that. But you guys are lucky, because what you're going to do is use what soldiers also use-- they use a bag like this to heat this food up. OK, now this is super clever. You'd think you need fire to heat this up, but this bag actually does it for you. It's totally flameless, this. So you open it up, like that. Inside is a little heat pack. You add some water to it, or something wet, this will get really, really hot. Roll it up. In about 10 minutes, a good hot meal. What's the problem with putting water in here? You waste it. You waste it, because itmixes with that heat pack, contaminates the water, so you waste water. And what's the most vitalresource in the wild? Water. Water, OK. We can also use-- Wee. Wee, OK. And the good thing is about putting in here, it's not gonna contaminate the food, because that's totally sealed. Clever? Yes. OK. I'll do the first one. I'm not weeing in a bag, I'll tell you that now. - I'm gonna wee. - Yeah, but you-- We know you will. There we go. OK, so now that will startto react with that heat pack. Look, it's already happening. See that? Whoa. OK, this gets mega hot. We wrap it up. Oh, I can already smell that. Oh, pff-- - Oh, what's it smell like?- No. Smell that? I can smell it. OK, there are two problems with this. One is that it smells terrible. The second problem is, you've got to put your hand in afterwardsto get the food out. Bwa! - Oh. But the good thing about this, while this is getting really hot, you keepit moving around, squishing around, heating up all thatfood, with the pee in it, with the heat pack, you can sit down. If you've got wet feet at the end of the day, sit down like this-- Keep your feet warm. And then you have to hold it. You don't burn your fingers, and it gets your feet nice and toasty. And you wait for your dinner to cook. 10 minutes, that'll be ready. Come, have a smell of that. No, thank you. Oh. Minging. That actually makes me want to gag. No, you have to smell it. It smells terrible. You haven't lived until you've had a sniff of somebody's boiling pee. And even though it smells a bit now, it's gonna be a lot better thanhaving cold military rations. Not many people can saythat they've met Bear Grylls and smelled his boiling pee. BEAR GRYLLS The team set off into the Welsh hillson their two day expedition. There'll be no letup as they face mountains, mines, and atough night out in the wild. But their first challengeis a navigation exercise. And if they're going to survive, they must locate their food rations. Out there, hidden, is food for everyone. I wonder which team is gonnaget closer to the food. Girls versus boys. Come on, boys, we need to do this. OK, and I'm gonna help you out by giving you a little button compass. Threedays into survival school, the girls are one up inthe team of the day vote. And the boys are determined tocatch up during the expedition. Think we're pretty confident. We need to kind of win this, because we can't let the girls beat us. OK, guys. We've got four or five legs. First checkpoint is an easy one. South 100 meters. Let's go, team, come on! Let's go. BEAR GRYLLS The team have to navigate via seriesof different locations. Guys, wait up. By counting their steps, they can work out how far they have traveled. But if they're not really accurate, they'll end up a long way from their dinner. Guys, come here. 50 meters southwest. After just one stage, the two teams are alreadyat different points. So is it that way? It's that way. Let's go, come on. And they head off in different directions. I think we're right, compared to the boys. Yeah, we're not looking at the boys, because we're focusing on ourselves. 125 meters northwest. Maths is key here. 16 plus 63, so, like, 79. I wish I'd listenedmore in my maths classes. At each stage, the girls carefully plan their route, while the boys seem more interested in just charging off. Who's got the compass, lads? They should be following you, then. So it's all here, that'slike, a rough average. Yeah, it is. Yeah. OK, hopefully this is right. This is it, the last leg! Northeast 50 meters. I'm thinking it's down there. Should we look in the tree? See the trees that are separated from the rest? Yeah. BEAR GRYLLS The girls are getting really close to the food, which is hidden behind the mound. But the boys are way off track. The girls are a lot further away. Unless we heard it wrong. Both teams have reached the point where they thinkthe rations should be. The girls are just metersaway, but are unable to see the food behind the rocks. But from the boys' distant position, they catch a glimpse of the ration boxes and make a break for it. Guys, guys! Guys, guys! Unfortunately, fellas, youwere over 100 meters away from the correct position. Girls, you were 10 meters awayfrom the correct position. The girls win the challenge, but the boys feel they shouldhave been declared the winners. We won that so fairly, right. Like, exactly. You're not gonna-- if you'regoing in one direction, and you see where you wantto go, you're not gonna say, oh, now I've lost now, becausel'm not where my direction. We hadn't even finished walking. Exactly. We spotted it first. Stupid. Caramel flavor hot chocolate drink powder. Wait, wait, wait, how-- Kieron is furious. And when the camera turns away, he throws Scott's compass into the lake. Nah, we've got to share it with the boys. It's not fair. - Yeah. No. They're still a part of our team. Wait, guys, guys, guys. Melon mango and pineapple parfaits. I love mangoes! But they're still a part of the team. They're still a part of the team, it's not fair. - We never said we weren't--- Yeah, we weren't saying that. I did. OK, guys, that's the end of the challenge. Girls, you're the winners. Now, boys, let's make this clear. This wasn't a challenge just to find the food. It was a test of your micro navigation skills that you've just learned. Because you were so farwrong, you looked and saw the food over 100 meters away. That's not what the challenge was. Not to find the food. --right next to the food. That's not what the challenge was. It was to test your micro navigation skills. You lost. Do you know what, though? It's not the losing that bothers me. It's the nature in which you've lost. OK, you're really bad losers. We want to share our food with you. Despite the boys' behavior, the girls are still willing to split the rations. Just take it. There's loads of-- Sometimes you just needto just swallow your pride, Kieron. Thanks, guys. To cheer you up, read that. Like, read what's in it, it's so nice. Just one thing before we go, please. The two compasses I gave you, can I have them back, please? Mine fell out of my pocket. Thank you. Fell out of my pocket. I'm disappointed. Kieron is not owning up to Scott. OK, no problem. He said whoever got to the food first wins, and we got to it first. I'm surprised and concerned by the boys' behavior. Being competitive is great. We all need a little bit of pushing, and something to keep our edge. But that's very differentfrom being a bad loser. And that isn't good, especially in a tight group, and on an expedition in tough environments. So this is something the leaders and me are going to be working on hard to getrid of at the end of survival school. As I feared, the bad weather has set in, big time. But it won't be a problemfor the next challenge. The team are heading underground. I'm really excited, like, tosee what it's gonna be like. It's gonna be smelly and all of that. But for one survivor, it's her worst nightmare. I don't want to do it at all. I'm just kind of, like, nervous about this one. I'm really claustrophobic. Just take it a step at a time. Like, don't worry about what will be ahead. Worry about what you're doing at the moment. Yeah, but look at that. That could collapse at any point in time. It won't The disused slate mine is nearly half a miledeep, and fraught with danger. Guys, listen up. This is when it gets serious. OK? If that happens in the mine, itwill take hours to be rescued. For Savannah, it doesn't get any harder than this. With a phobia of smallspaces, just entering the mine will be an achievement. Do you think you can do it? No. Look at them, over there. You're a part of that team. You will be fine. Savannah bravely decides to give it a go. Three, two, one! OK, slowly walking in. As they head into the 150-year-old mine, Savannah is immediately faced with a small, dark passageway. To test their teamwork and bottle, their first challenge is tofind their way down the tunnel in complete darkness. I now need your head torches. Give them to me in your hand. I'd rather go home, turn yourself right round. - No you wouldn't. - Savannah. I really would. I really-- You take that off, and your mom will be the proudest in the world. Come on, you can do it. Yeah, I know! Yes. Yeah, Savannah, yes. Sav, you can do this. You can do it. Without their head torches, they can see absolutely nothing. But with infrared cameras, wecan follow what they're doing. It's fine, look. Close your eyes for 30seconds, and then open them. Deprived of sight, they must rely on each other to make it along the slippery path. We're doing it as a team. We can do this, OK, all together. Everyone in a line. Just go slow. Just go slow, Sav. With Kieron's help, Savannah is forcing herselffurther into the mine. Count to ten, deep breaths. Andthe whole team make it safely to the end of the first tunnel, where their head torches are waiting. Now it's time to shed some light on this. Yes, thank you. Savannah really impressed me then. We came into the entrance of the cave, and she was really scared. We've had a couple of fits of crying, but she's crossed her first hurdle. Trust me, come on. Guys, oh. I'm really pleased to see the change in Kieron. It's largely thanks to him thatSavannah is fighting her fears. See, that's fine, isn't it? Theyhead even deeper into the mine, and the going is getting morehazardous as they're forced to edge around sheer drops. Be careful of your footing. Lots and lots of debris fall down, OK. I'm not keen, because I don't like heights. Oh. Don't look back. Don't look down. Look forward. Look where you're going. Keep going, Adam. Fantastic. Well done, Adam! I just hate, like, drops like that. It's just high-- high upthings, it's absolutely hell. Oh. I'm a bit worried, because we've gone so far down the cave. Atthe very bottom of the descent they'll face a unique challengewhich will test their courage to the very limit. What is that? This is the final challenge. You are going to be takinga leap into the unknown. No way. It is a sheer drop into the abyss. It'sthe ultimate leap of faith, into pitch black. What you need to do-- --screw it. --is be confident, and step out, and trust that you'll be fine. Guys, good luck. No, I'm going back. Sav, you can do it. No, no, come on, come on, come on. Sav-- I'm not-- I'm not gonna do this one. Savannah, come on. Savannah has done incredibly well to get so deep into the mine, but this may be a step too far. So far, yeah, you've saidyou can't do everything. - Yeah, but where-- - But you've done it. You've done it. So why-- why is this stopping you? Take hold with two handsand a positive jump, OK? What does that say? Survival school. You're learning to get over your fears, and that's what it's all about. Ready to go? Yeah. Two, one, go. Yeah! She's down. It was very scary andnerve-racking at the start. But now I've done it, I'm justglad I'm safe on the ground. A little bit of wee might come out. I was actually excited, but nowl'm kind of nervous about this. But you only live once, do it.- Go. Another one down. Azriel, buddy, you're up. Go for it. Man's up in it. Go on. Whoa! Catch me. Oh, I'm a bit more nervousthan I would have thought. Three, two, one. No point in going back. Carry on. Come on, you can do it. Kieron leaves Savannah to make up her mind. OK. Let's go. Whoa! That was just the mostamazingingist thing ever. I tried shouting something, but I had that much adrenaline, my voice just wouldn't work. BEAR GRYLLS Savannah has taken a momentous decision. Remember, you don't jump. Don't lean back. Just a good, positive step. Go on to the edge. Right? OK. Oh my god. That was awesome. That was awesome. That was awesome. What did she say? That was one of the best things I've done in a long time. I'm so happy I did that. It feels unreal. I just knocked the fear out of me. I mean, I feel I could justjump off the end of the world. And that is exactly what survival school is all about. Total respect to Savannah, and to Kieron for helping her overcome a real phobia. They emerge into torrential rain. And their high spirits soonplummet when they see where they'll be spending the night. It's the ruins of a buildinghalfway up a mountain, with no roof or windows. Conditions are so bad, the leaders have rigged a makeshift shelter. All inside of the shelter. I'm still caught into mine. Could you, Kev? We're cold. We are soaking wet. Our shoes are soaking wet. Our socks are wet.- Come on, girls, keep positive. Our feet are really wet, as well. Yeah, stay positive, girls. Yeah, well I'm telling them the situation, so-- OK. Anyway, and then there's no fire. No, it's too wet-- But we're all trying tostay positive, especially us. The shelter still need securing properly, and the team are forgetting their training. Before we do anything, priorities of survival. What's the first one? - Fire. - No. - Protection. Protection. The shelter's been done for you, but look at it. There's actually still some elements coming in. But rather than improve the shelter, some of the boysseem more interested in moaning about their situation. Look at that. Look at it, it hasn't evengot a door, or anything. People annoy me, and they'reall, oh yeah, I'm so positive. I don't care. That's you, cool. Stay positive. Everyone's just moaning and-- And then they're going, I'm not quitting, but I don't want to do this. Oh, just-- just get on with it. It's just like, chill out. Yeah, it's raining. We're wet. We're cold. It's not exactly cheer-- Yeah, but we-- we don't have another choice. This is it. With a storm moving in, and winds are already gustingup to 40 miles an hour, Scott is forced to intervene. All right, guys, listen. Az, turn around. In case you don't understandthe severity of the situation, we're high on the mountain, it's pouring down with rain, it's cold, and someone's gonnago down with hypothermia. This is a proper survivalsituation at the moment. If you don't listen to me, do what I say, someone's gonna get hurt. We've got to work as a team. Yes. So these big bags, you want to push them against the rear and the side to block the wind coming in, OK? Start working. Let's go, guys, come on, come on. Spread them all the way along, let's go. Bailey, pass that bag down to-- Don't stand up, lads. You'll break the shelter, lads. Bailey, put all these bags outside. With the bags in place, the next priority is food. It's imperative in these sort of conditions you get a hot meal inside you. Do you recognize these? Oh no, mate. Oh no. You'll do them. There's one for you. - Pass them down. Pass them down, one each. Tear it across here. Read the writing first, so you're looking at them the right way. That's it. Should be like that, now. I've ripped through instructions a bit, but I'm just gonna wing it. I'm just gonna copy everyone else. Come on then, crew. I'm not hungry. I've got potatoes. I'm starving. Basically, you're gonna pee in this bag, and then there's a thing that reacts with water, and it makes it boiling hot. I'll go do it over here. Whilstthe boys get down to business, the girls aren't so keen. I'm not reaching in pee. It's just-- and then-- and it'll be all dripping, and I don't have no, like, tissue, or anything. I bet I'll miss the bag. That would be literally me. I bet I wouldn't and I'djust get it all over my hand. Oh, that's minging. Oh, man. Great, put it on the floor. Put it on the floor. Don't drop it. That's it. There it goes. Oh, my pee stinks worse than Bear Grylls'. It's pretty disgusting, butit's not gonna touch the food. And I'm gonna get a hot meal at the end of it, so I'm not bothered, really. I don't want to do this, but I'm really hungry. Should we get some toilet roll, guys? It's not so much peeing in the bag. It's the fact that we'regonna eat what's in the bag. Even if it's in another bag, it's just gross. BEAR GRYLLS The girls have decided to waste fresh water, rather than use their wee. Girls, I have to say you've won the challenge in the navigation, but you'vedefinitely lost the challenge for wee in the bag. I'll give you some fresh water, though. Thank you. - Thank you. - It stinks. Get a whiff of this-- look. Ew. With everyone organized and well fed, the team have turned their fortunes around. I would recommend peeing ina bag in a survival situation to eat some warm food. Honestly, it's the nicestthing in the world. This stuff's amazing. I don't even mind peeing in abag if the taste is this good. It's nice, isn't it? I told you. What did I say to you? You've never had a real hot chocolate? - What did I say to you? - But you've never-- - What did I say to you? - But you've never-- - What did I say? - You've never-- Zip. What was that? It's great. But oneboy is still struggling to cope with the realities of survival. Don't want to eat anything. I don't want to have anything. I'm just cold and wet. I don't want to be outhere when it's like this. Yeah, if it was warmer, but the wind is so strong, and the rain, I just hate it. Charlie, you're just taking it too far. You just need to get on with it. People find differentthings hard, lots of people are struggling for different reasons. It's called survival school. You kind of have to realize that you're going to be doing stuff that's hard, and that you don't actually like. Charlie has separated himself from the group. I just like getting my own time, sometimes, just letting myself think. I just don't want to be around people. That just gets annoying sometimes. I don't want to give up, but I just don't want to stay here tonight. I know. I just guess it's a bitharder to cope with this. I can't do it anymore. This is gonna be the toughest night the team have ever faced. I can't wait to go to sleep. Get in your bags. Time is running now. There's a rock right there. It's perfect, then. No, it's really-- I don't know where Alana's gone. I'm on the toilet. Don't come out here! That's where Alana's gone. Conditions like these can make or break individuals. I want these zips done up, right up to your neck and shoulders. BEAR GRYLLS I'm hoping the team will come out all the stronger-- Goodnight, everybody. BEAR GRYLLS --if they can make it through the night. Next time on "Bear Grylls Survival School," drama on a dangerous mountain. And gossip spreads around camp. Kieron likes Maria. I didn't say I didn't.
