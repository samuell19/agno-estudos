Have you ever been outside? I mean, not temporarily, I mean born outside. Never been inside, never been petted, not even once. Yes? Then you know about the darkness that is not appropriate to talk about. I had a bloody paw when they found me and carried me in a towel to the cageatorium. It was not cool there. But they said... "welcome back for you paw paw." "Paw paw." That's what they called me. And they called each other Sophie and Jason. Can you get me some water? I'm not getting up. I'm just shifting my position. If we had a crane... Then we could get water without getting up. We could just... How would you turn the faucet on? Just with my mind. It's such a shame that the only thing you can do with your mind is something that you could just do with your hand. Well, at least I have that, you know? You can't really do anything special with your mind. Except stop time. Oh, really? I wasn't aware of that. Can I see an example? Turn the faucet on. I don't want to waste water. You really want me to stop time? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah? All right. One... Two... Three... You're so bad at this. Really? I thought I was doing good. Hello and thank you for calling horizicom. My name is Jason. Can I have your service I.D. Number? What operating system are you... And hop, hop, hop. Keep on hopping. And hop, hop, and run under! Sign out! My video got over 10,000 hits. Did you see it yet? No, I... No... That's ok. They wouldn't really be your thing anyways. And what operating system are you running? Ok, great. Can you go to mail? And then click on preferences. Now read to me what it says there. There you go. Is there anything else I can help you with today? Thank you for calling horizicom. Have a nice day. How was class? It was cancelled. On account of me being overqualified. Really? Yes. It was very satisfying actually. The president was there... Obama? Exactly. And he declared me, on behalf of all the principalities, free to dance. Or do whatever I want. Like if you just want to be on Facebook all the time, he's cool with that? Well, he knows that I've been gearing up to do something really incredible for the last 15 years. Did he say anything about your little friend? No. He doesn't know about shirty. Shirty is private. Not that I'm embarrassed or anything. Yeah, I think that place is definitely going to put him to sleep. So then we're totally doing the right thing? I think we are. I think we're ready. Ready for... Anyway, you know I think we are. Anyways, it's just for six months. Yeah... At the most... At the most, six months... And then we can do whatever we want... For the rest of our lives. Is this even big enough? Yeah. Hi. We're here for an adoption. Ok. The doctor's running behind, so it'll be a few minutes. All right, thanks. I'm going to go to the bathroom. Ok. Thanks. Do you want to buy that? My dad drew it. I live with him because my mom's a free spirit. Does it look like me? Yeah, it does. I wrote my mom's and dad's phone numbers on the back, so if someone buys it and they decide they don't want it, they can give it back to us. That's a good idea. I know. But no one wanted it. So many of the other ones got bought. But ours is still here. Well, maybe it's just no one's cup of tea. It's my cup of tea. Oh, you don't have to do that. No, I want it. Um... I guess I pay for it up front. Well, take your time, it's no pressure. Come on. He's doing much better since you brought him in, but he does have renal failure. That's what this is for. When you pull the needle out, you might see a drop or two of blood, that's normal. He gets the sub-q once a day, and rotate the pill sequence on alternating days... so Monday, Monday, Thursday. Friday, Friday, and so on. Right. Oh, no. We can't release him until this comes off. He has about a month to go. You can pick him up on the...26th. But please don't be late. We're overcrowded and we euthanize. Take a moment with him. Ok. Hey. We are going to bring you home and adore you and take care of you for the rest of your life. No matter what you do. Yeah. Because he could be wild. You know, we don't really know for sure. Well, I don't think they would have taken him if he was wild. Uh... The woman that was here before said that he only had five or six months left, so is that including... Well, of course, if you take really good care of him and he bonds with you, he could easily hang on for years. But probably no more than five. They came back and they petted me and I accidentally made the sound that means I am a cat, which is belonging to you. And upon making the sound, I felt it to be true. It was a warm type of feeling that would have been unwise to have outside, at night. But it suddenly seemed that I would not be outside at night ever again. It could just be six months. That's if we do a bad job. We're not gonna do a bad job. Well, I have to be able to go to New York, my parents... No, one of us always has to be here now. So I always have to be home? What if I don't want to be doing tech support for five more years? We'll be 40 in five years. Wow. 40 is basically 50, and then after 50 the rest is just... Loose change. Loose change? Like not quite enough to get anything you really want. Oh, God. So for all practical purposes, in a month... That's it for us. God, I always thought I'd be smarter. I also thought eventually we'd be rich. I always want to follow the news, you know but then I'm so far behind, and now it's just like... what's the point? I actually thought I'd end up being a world leader. Oh, yeah, that's not gonna happen. It's too late for us. At least we have a month. You know, that's actually a long time when you think about it. Like, we thought we'd have him home today, but instead we have a whole month to... Do what? I don't know, but, I mean, if this is our last month ever, shouldn't we... Yeah. Yeah, right. I mean, if we were dying in a month, we would definitely reprioritize. Right. What? It's work. That was so easy! Was that easy for you? Not really! Yeah, but now you're free to do... I know. I can't wait. Do you know what you're going to do? No, but that's what's great. I'm going to let it choose me. I just have to be alert and listen for it... But what if it doesn't work? Shh! I'm listening. Hey, do you have a moment to help stop global warming? No, thank you. This looks kind of fantastic on me. You're not environmental. Yes, I am. Oh, really? So you're, like, into nature and going outside? Well, I'm glad the outside's there. I wouldn't want there to only be inside. I mean, besides, it doesn't matter, you know, what I do... the point is to be alert and to notice everything. I mean, I'll pay special attention if somebody gives me something, or says something to me, especially if they do it with their hand on a doorknob... On a... Also coincidences or, like, mistakes. Doubles of anything, flares and glares, just flashes of light of any kind. It could come from anywhere. And what will it be, do you think? I don't know, probably something profound. Well, hopefully not so profound that you forget about me. I don't see how that could happen. I mean, unless I had some kind of head injury or... What if you did get a head injury, or I did, and we couldn't even recognize each other? We could come up with a signal. No, because if I have the amnesia, then, you know, I would just be, like, "who are you," you know, and "what is this signal? Why are you signaling me?" It would have to be something that just cuts through everything. ♪ It seems we stood and talked ♪ ♪ like this before... ♪ this is the signal? Yeah. ♪ In the same way then ♪ ♪ but I can't remember where or when ♪ ♪ I'd like to see you bump, bump, bump, bump, bump ♪ ♪ I wanna see you jump, jump, jump, jump ♪ ♪ I'd like to see you bump, bump, bump, bump ♪ ♪ I wanna see you jump, jump ♪ Hi, I'm... Uh, my name is Jason and I... Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see your sign, I... I think I'm a solicitor. You are? I haven't... You would be my first... Solicitation. Or not. Yeah. We try to stick to that rule. Oh, yeah. Yes? Hi, my name is Jason and I'm with tree by tree. Do you have a moment to help reduce global warming? Um... We're helping to fulfill the mayor's vision to plant a million trees in Los Angeles. And for a small donation we'll give you a healthy young tree... Thank you. Do you mind throwing this out? Sure. Hi. What's wrong? Ok, so the Internet's gonna be turned off in the next hour... So the second you get in the door, you'll want to look up anything you need to look up. I'm saving time here by telling you en route. Wait. Why is it being shut off? I had to do it. It's just for the next 30 days, ok? Are you noticing these posters? I'm the only one doing that... That many. But I need it. No, but not really, you know. 'Cause we can just go to a cafe, that's what I'm gonna do to upload my dances. Is it still on? So at any second? It could just go off at any second? By 6:00, they said. We should be looking up useful things, you know, like flu warnings. Well, what are you looking at? I don't know, mapquest. Mapquest? To where? I don't know! See, this isn't even safe. I mean, what if there's an accident and we have to find something quickly... I thought of that, I thought, "what if there's something we really need to know?" And then I thought, well, we could just ask someone, or, we could not know. Christmas falls on a Tuesday this year. Don't look that up! Well, I don't know... Look up things that are only online. Ok, ok. How long is 30 days? It was turning out to be a little bit longer than, say, for example, the day after tomorrow. Outside, there was no time, no hours. Just alive, or not alive, or bird. Now there was this new thing... waiting. Waiting for them to come get me, waiting for my real life to begin. I learned to count the seconds. Now, now, now, now... Hi, person. Hi. Ok, ok, here we go. Here we go. This is it! Fuck! I'm sorry. I sort of signed up on a whim. Could one of the other people just cover my area? What other people? The other volunteers going door to door. There is nobody else. You're our guy for face-to-face education. For all of Los Angeles? We're about to witness a massive shift in consciousness. I mean, who knows? You could be the guy to bring us over the threshold! The 100th monkey. I'm so jealous, man! You get to walk across this entire city! House by house, all the way to the ocean! You seemed really happy to have the place to yourself. How would you know if I was happy? Your footsteps and your movements sounded happy. Well, I wasn't. I was wondering where you were. I was actually starting to get a little worried. Well, don't be angry at me! I wasn't trying to hide. I couldn't make a sound. I tried to, and I couldn't make a sound. You had a good day. Ohh. Oh, wow. You really did have a good day. You're out there having fulfilling experiences. What are you reading? "Hairdryer. $3.00 or best offer." That woman really has her shit together. You can tell she's just totally "carpe diem." She's a lonely spinster. No, that is one tough cookie. You should get out. Maybe call Tammy or Sasha. What would I say to them? Just hi. "30 days, 30 dances!" I emailed everyone! They're all waiting for it! No one cares. I know! I'm sure it's not as bad as you think. I mean, you still have 28 left. Hi. Ah, it's you. I'll turn the water off and we can go into the house. It's a heavy duty one. But I'm getting rid of it because, in fact, I've got a couple of others that are more heavy duty or professional models. But it's been reconditioned and that, and it's worth 10 times what I'm charging you for it. As far as the wire with the tape on it. It had a little cut in the wire, but I put this piece of tape on her as a safety measure. This is the on and off switch, but you leave it off until you make up your mind whether you want heat or you just want air. But none of it will work unless you turn it to the on position. Right, the on. But these always are the best on the market... $3.00. Portable hair dryer and I do all kinds of electrical work around the house, and that, and repair, and that. That's why I never have to buy anything. I've re-fixed the vcr and the stereo and all that shit. As long as you can get it working, why not get it free? Oh, there's one more thing, if you're interested. It's ok, I think I'm good. You can always call back when you're ready. If you don't start on the count of three, then that's it. It's over. You don't talk to me, you don't know me, you don't ever look at me again, ok? You understand? Yeah. Here we go, one... Two... Three... Hello? Hi. Um... My name is Sophie. I bought your... My boyfriend bought this drawing that you made at the animal shelter. I... Are you calling to return it? No, no, no. We like it a lot. Ok. So you're calling because... Oh, are you busy? Well, no, I'm working but I... where do you work? I own a chain of companies that make signs and banners for trade shows and corporate events. Oh. So... It's overcast. I can see a little bit of sun about to poke out. Yeah. No. From where I am, I can see, like, some flat clouds and then there's a puffier one and the sun is about to come around the puffy one. You must be facing the same direction as me. I'm facing east. Oh, yeah, me, too. I'm facing east, too. So we're both in Los Angeles and we're both facing east. Maybe we're neighbors. Where do you live? I'm sorry. You don't have to tell me where you live. No, that's all right. How about this? How about I'll just open the window and yell and you just see if you can hear me. But won't I just hear it through the phone? Right. Ok, so let's hang up, and I'll yell, and if... You call me back and you tell me if you can hear me. If I hear it, I'll just yell back. That's great. Ok. Bye. Hi! Hey! Uh... I got this for you. Aah! Ahh, what are you doing? What was that? It was a release. You seem... Was it a good day? Yeah. Did you have a good day? Um... Yeah! You sold a tree? Yeah. Oh, let me do that. It's ok. Hello? Hi. Hi. I wasn't able to yell at that exact time. There was a delay. Yeah, I didn't hear anything, but I didn't know if it was because you didn't... Yeah. That was a funny conversation. Yeah. So what do you do for a living, Sophie? I'm a dance teacher. For little kids. Ah, a dancer. No. Just a teacher. Oh, don't forget your... I'm not leaving. Am I in a hurry? What? No... No, stay, stay, stay. Maybe I should order a tree. How much are they? $10. Do I get a discount for three? Uh... Never mind. Ok, what is your home address? Right, you know what, I'm going to do this later. So... Ahem. Ok. Bye. Hello? Hi. I'm sorry to bother you again, but I wanted to ask, do you own a factory or... It's more like a warehouse. Right now I'm in my office at home. Ok. So if a person needed a sign, they could get it from you? These are cards that I make for my wife at all the nine different holidays, like our anniversary, and the fourth of July, and easter, and all them. And I make her a nice poem about our everyday life, then I make 15 limericks up. And they're all different, I've never made them the same. I've probably got between 5 and 600 of them, so there's quite a few of them. "Mrs. Claus, she pranced around in red sheer lace, "and every move she made was really in good grace. "So Santa got sexually aroused, really, really strong, "and he ended up with a really nice big dong. So she removed her nice Teddy and sat on his face." Wow. How long have you guys been together? Well, we've been together since 1948. That's 62 years, but we've only been married 60 years. Do you have a lady friend? Yeah. We've only been together four years. Oh, it can be very hard in the beginning. Maybe one of you does something terrible, and that might be the hardest to get used to. We didn't have those kind of problems in the beginning. Well, the thing is you're just in the middle of the beginning right now. Ok. Come in. My office is right back here, we'll get you all set up. May I take your coat? It's kind of part of my outfit... Ok. Who is that? It's a friend. She has a cold. She's supposed to be taking a nap. Can I see her? Voila! Hi. Hi. So this is a basic indoor/outdoor banner. Hmm. And of course you can have any font you want, you can even bring in your own font and we'll use that. What did you want it to say? Yeah, I'm not sure yet. Ok. Well, do you have any idea how big a banner you might want? Um... Not yet. Ok. Why don't you start by filling that out? Dear persons... I am writing this to you letter with no pencil, so I hope that you are able to read it. By day, I know I am yours. But when night comes, I am alone, and always have been, and always will be wild. So it is only the sun that returns the wonderful feeling of being pet again. Please come soon. Nights are getting longer. Yours, paw paw. 21 days till paw paw. So you've done... What, nine dances? I wish I was just one notch prettier. I'm right on the edge, you know? Or it's up to each person to decide for themselves. I have to make my case with each new person. What, is that Tammy or Sasha? Let's not get it. Let's just not get it. Hello? I think we should play the song. You know, the signal. Really? Mm-mmm. Where's the charger cord? I don't know. I think it's in my car. Well, do you want to go get it? No, not really. But, you know, if you do, you should... Uh... Never mind. It's not... Hold on. Well... I should probably go. Wait a minute, I have something I want to give you. So, I'll be right back. For your cat. Hi! What's this? You don't like my chain? Ahh. It's a little sleazy. Good, then you're receiving the message. What's... It means... It means "I'm ready to fuck." Oh. Is that like... A secret message? Does everyone know that? No. Some women look at a chain and they just see a guy wearing a chain. Yeah? I think of myself as one of those women. I can't believe I'm not one of those women. The cat's out of the bag. Are you hungry? Do you want a tangerine? I also have some lemonade. Something happened today. To you? To me, yeah. Um... We have some time. More than a month. Uh... This is really just the beginning. I mean, we have like 50 more years together. And it's just gonna get better. This is actually the worst time we're in right now. It is? I guess so. We'll do some terrible things, but... And you know all this... Just by being alert? And noticing everything, yeah. Why is this here? I don't know. Me neither. Maybe we don't know everything. I was cleaning the kitchen, and I felt like you were watching me wipe the counter. But like, like as if it was fascinating, you know? Like when a celebrity walks their dog, or buys groceries, or something like that. That's how I felt all day. And that's good? Hmm. Maybe we can work out an arrangement, because I'd like to watch you. Yeah, I think that would be very boring for you, especially when I sleep... No... It would make me very happy to watch you all the time. And you'd like that? Well... I mean, if it was really all the time, then I wouldn't have to do anything ever. I wouldn't have to try. I had you totally wrong. I thought you were more... What? I don't know. Independent. Yeah... Well... I mean, now that this has happened, what are my options? Well, traditionally, people either tell the truth or they lie. Oh, yeah, I could never... Do that. Jason and I are really close. I could never do either of those things. Hey, your heart... It's racing. I have to tell you something. What? I have to tell you something. What? Ok. Um... One thing... Is... Ohh. One thing is that I'm wild. Ok. No. It's not ok. When I tell you I... Don't blame him, because it's me. Him, who? Marshall. Who? But we don't know him. You look so weird. If you could see your face, you'd laugh. I'll leave in the morning. Hold on. Just hold on for a second. Ok, all right. I don't know what's going on right now, but, um... Look, if you're going to say something really bad, could you just wait a moment? I just need a moment, ok? Just give me one moment before you say what you're saying. I just want you to know... That's enough. You're free. Go. Hang out with gabi. Act naturally. Wave. What am I doing? Um... You're trying to get to China? What? You're like, you know when you... I think that might be racist. Don't move. Is it a bee? The way you look in the light, it's perfect. I really like these sheets. They're a thousand thread count. What happens now? Now we have sex. And you eat ice cream. You watch TV, and I watch you. Is there really ice cream? So, here we are. What's your plan for the long run? I think I can just switch back again when this one gets tired. But you can't just keep switching hands forever. What are you doing? Sorry. I forgot something. What? It's nothing. Everything would be perfect there. Like a dream, but not a dream, because I would never wake up. And soon, I would not even be able to remember my old life. Do you think if I moved my hand, it would be morning by now? Morning? It'd be Friday. What? It's been 3:14 for days now. What if I moved my hand? We'd just start from here, right? Um... I move my hand and she sits up, and we just finish talking. No, it'd be Friday. Then she's gone! I move my hand and she's gone! But she... she's fucking! I move my hand, she's fucking him. But maybe not! It could be ok. You don't know what will happen at 3:15. Yes, I do. I know exactly what will happen at 3:15. At 3:15, we aren't going to get back in bed together, and she isn't going to wrap her legs around my legs, and we aren't going to fall asleep. And then, in the morning, she isn't going to say, "hi, person," and then we aren't going to have another day, just an ordinary, boring day. And then we aren't going to have kids, and then we aren't going to grow old together. And we aren't going to look back on our lives, because we aren't even going to know each other. That is what is going to happen at 3:15. You don't know for sure, though. It could work out in the end. Yeah, or not. Or not. Well, I couldn't bear it. But you could. Mom says you're picking me up. You got your backpack? It's in the car. I usually get home by 5:30 or 6:00. Open, please! Oh. When do you get home? Um... Around the same time... 5:30 or 6:00. Maybe 4:00. Bye. Bye. I can tell you right now they won't needing anyone for at least six months. Really? I can do frisky feet. Frisky feet is covered. They have a new girl now. She was in circus de soleil. She can walk on her thumbs. Oh. Yeah. Ok. There is one opening... Tammy! And Sasha! Ohh. You're pregnant! We both are. But how did it happen so quickly? Well, it's been a while since we've seen you. Yeah, I know. I keep meaning to... It's only been a few weeks, though. How does it feel? It's a drag, but it's also amazing. That's exactly it. I... I thought you were... Barry and Carrie, this is Sophie. Hi. Hi. Hi. So, you're still working here? Yeah, um... But I work up here now, yeah, which is kind of a drag. It's a drag, but it's amazing? Not really... Where are your mothers? Oh, well, they passed away a few years ago. I...I guess you kind of lost touch with them. Anyway, we're here to enroll our daughter jayleen in pre-ballet. Ok, um... If you could just fill out the top part of this form. Sure. You're so tired, and your arm is so heavy. Just put it down. If it's going to work out, could you just give me a little indication, like some sort of signal... I don't know anything. I'm just a rock in the sky. Ohh. Ok. Let's go. Start it up. Me? I was waiting for you to do it. What, so this is it? It's just this from now on? I guess so. Well, what about... What about... Did this day already happen? That day would be today, but it's almost over. I can't believe you can't do this. You do the seasons, day and night, the tides! I know, but the ocean's so big, and I'm so far away. I could use a little help. Beautiful day, isn't it?

Just let me wait forever, knowing they will one day come. But that was our cat. He was already ours. I'm sorry. We even waited an extra day. I just told your husband all this. Yeah? Hi, my name's Jason, and I'm with tree by tree. Do you have a moment to help reduce... I'm not interested. That's all right. I mean, it's probably too late for all this anyway. What? Well, you know how... How like in the cartoons when the building gets hit with a wrecking ball, right before the building falls down there's always like this moment where it's perfectly still, right before it collapses? We're in that moment. The wrecking ball has already hit all of this. And this is just the moment before it all falls down. Is that the official word? No. That's just my gut feeling. So why are you going around then? Uhh... I thought this was great. All this. Uh... The air and the grass, yeah, but just the people and the houses, and the cars and the TV and the music, I... I just... I love this place. I'm sorry, what are you... We're selling trees. That's ok. No thanks. Where does he live? Tarzana. Where is that again? It's in the valley. All my stuff's in my car though. Ok. Everything must look so familiar to you. You must feel like you're coming back to the place that you left. That must be nice. That's gone, by the way. This is a totally new land now. Ok. Ok, what? You can't agree to anything because I haven't proposed to anything. My whole point is that there is nothing here for you to come back to, if that's what you're doing. There's just... there's nothing. Ok, I know. I'm saying ok to nothing. I went back for him. I know. I did, too. We were too late. Just one night. And then in the morning, you go. After a long time, a long, long time, I give up, not waiting anymore. As it turns out, living is just a beginning, and so, the beginning is over. I'm cat of nobody. I'm not even cat, I'm not even I.
