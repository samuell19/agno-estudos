The Whale. A little bit more. Go. Monica! -Hello Alice. Did you bring what I wanted? -Of course. Sorry, I'm always late. A glass of fernet. How much? -300 Lire. I'll be finished in a few minutes. It's always breaking. -It's been hit so hard. I'm not bothered about it, I only come here to see you. Get out of here! I haven't seen you all week. I've got a lot of work. Don't be upset... A gift from the company. Company? -If you say so! Goodbye, beautiful. Just make up an excuse, who cares? -You could say you were with me. No, on Sunday I have to....! Go. Go! Holy cow... There's a roadblock. Stay calm, I'll deal with it. The documents for the van, please. Here. Drivers license. Here. It's not your van? -It belongs to the company. You were speeding. -It was a slow tractor...! That's how accidents happen. -Look, if I'm late it'll be worse. I've got to issue this fine. How much? -5000 Lire. Your documents. Your copy. Can I go now? -You're free to go. A woman? -Close the doors. Know how they treat you in hospital? It's not nice, believe me. It's a sad day when you end up in the hands of the doctors. Get the things from the van. What about him? He's a good kid. The doctor says our baby has a swelling in the ear... She could go deaf... It's complicated and expensive, I really don't need this now. Okay, I'll talk to a friend of mine in admissions. If not for me, then for my wife, you tell her I can't come home. Relax, in eight days you'll be back in your own bed. What the hell are you doing? Do you want to break everything? It's all fragile. Damn it! She'll hear us... Don't be stupid. Just one small thing. What about this? Put it under the sink. Put the watch in there as well. Paolo, if you want, I'll see your wife and calm her down. Via Milazo 25. See you soon. Carletto? -Gino? That you? Yes, Everything okay? -Everything's okay. Problems? -None. You're still here. -Yes... We were promised an advance. There's 500,000, be careful. We are. What's she doing? Eating? She's eaten. She's upset. Go have a look. -I'm going. You've got to watch her, I'm not doing everything. Where's she going? She's a fish in a net, what do fish do in nets? Have it your way. What do you want? Nothing... I need to go toilet. How can I? Something wrong? -No, why? I'm responsible for both of you and I don't want any trouble. Close the door. Listen carefully... All we have to do now is wait, nothing more... There's no risk, unless you bring it on yourselves... These are the pills... Give her two, three times a day. No more than two pills... If you give her too many it'll mess her up. What if she gets excited? -calm her down, that's why I pay you. Here. This is what she needs to write. I brought your Barberra. You're going to write a letter... To your family. Good. Write... 'Dear father...' Come on, write it. 'Dear father, I am well.'... 'I hope to see you soon.' Write! 'I hope to see you soon...' '...but my life is in your hands.' Come on! '...but my life is in your hands.' Continue! '...in your hands.' Hurry... Write it down! Your signature. Any trouble? -No. Good. Did you go to my house? -Yes, the kid's a lot better... ...she'll be out of hospital soon. My wife might need cash? Now? -Yes. I'll try and get an advance, then I can take the cash to your wife... Not tonight though, I need to deal with the letter. What do you want? My shoulders hurt... I can't stay like this. Turn around. Put your head down against the cushion. Don't move. What did she want? Nothing... Her back was hurting so I tied her hands up in front. We can't destroy her. It's your business. Where are you going now? I'm always alone here. I'm going to see my daughter. When are you coming back? This afternoon, maybe tomorrow. What do you care? The little girl? -She was discharged earlier. Good evening. -Good evening. Good evening Theresa. -Hi Paolo, how's your daughter? She's back home. I brought her medicine. -You should've come earlier... The doctor said one after every meal but she's just eaten... We'll wait till midnight. I'd have gone to the pharmacy but I don't like leaving her alone. Is there anything to eat? -Yes, minstrone... Want me to warm it up? -I'll eat it cold. I was thinking... -What? You went to Boscone for the machines. -I didn't go to Boscone. Why not? -They don't need the revision. All those customers and they don't need the revision? Maybe they called someone else, or their machines don't break anymore? What do you care? -I say it for you, you'll lose clients. She's asleep. Come on... Don't be like that... ...she'll recover. It's not only her. -What is it? This life... You're always away. -I have to work. Is there anything else to eat? -Yes, I've got two tins. More tins! -What's that meant to mean? Look, I'm not hungry. Don't be like that, relax. I've got something going on... What is it? -The usual, what else? Cigarettes? -Yes, cigarettes... Contraband, respectable people do it too. But this is low risk... It's a favour for a friend. As soon as I collect I'll take you both to Aguelia. You me and the kid to Aguelia, every night in a pizzerria... Pizzerria? No, I'll take you both to restaurants. Let's go next door. We'll wake her. We'll make a noise. -Let's go next door. She's asleep! Let's go over there. Let me go and clean up. -Stay here a while longer. Now what is it? You're here so little and I'm always thinking of you. We've got time... They've still got another year of work, and Brazil is far away. He's my husband... What will I tell him? What'll we say? We'll tell him what happened... When someone has a wife like you, and a child to support... It's better to find work closer to home. Six. Twenty two Eight. Fourteen. I win. 200,000? -200,000. Another game? -Yes. Make it 300,000? -Okay. Reset the scores. I've finished. Drink. -More? No. Come on. -It hurts, I'm nauseous. My face is burning, you're poisoning me. You must take them. -Throw the pills away. Don't get close to her... We're not joking around. You've got it good here, all day on your backside... You're not taking any risks. This isn't a job for someone with a family. Then why does your wife boss you around? Go easy on the pepper. -What's happening? No one tells me! They're trying to pay less; don't have the cash; need more time. We'll make them pay... ...even if we have to kill her. Avanzini, Gino. -Hello. The commissioner want a word. -Right now? You got an appointment? -No, but... this guy's a champion. I don't meet someone like him everyday. So? We're half way, at least let us play to ninety? Come on Gino, let's go. I'm sorry, I'll be back soon. -Don't worry. Let's go. Alice, calm down. Now you're in trouble as well. Don't play smart with me, idiot! Are you really going to tell them you saw my face?... It'll come back to you, we'll still get our cash! Whore... You're a whore and you'll sleep with anyone! Nice letters! -They're from my boyfriend, why? How many boyfriends have you got? One, two, three... Did you enjoy the other night? While you were sleeping. -Was it you? Who did you think it was? -I was scared it was one of them. Your name's Alice, like the fish... Yes, like a... like a fish! What's this? Reginus Orca. -What? I like men's shirts, it belongs to Umberto, a friend of mine. One of these guys from the letters? Avanzini, Gino... This time you're really in it. It's a passion commissioner, I've told the brigadier... I'd play for fun, but they don't play unless I bet. Forget billiards, sit down. I don't care about your games... Where were you on Saturday, the sixth? Two weeks ago. Don't remember? I'll tell you: You were seen in Via. Gerbito That's absurd, I haven't been there for two months! I work, I don't go for walks. -But you knew the Maltese? Did you know him or not? -Yes... Why? -Don't you read the papers?... They've been talking about it for the last two weeks... They found him dead in his apartment on Via. Gerbito. Tuesday the sixth, and at 09:30 you were there! Tuesday the sixth? -Yes. 09:30 in the morning? -Yes. Impossible, I was working. I start at 08:00... Tuesday the sixth... Yes, I on the Beccha bridge... I was stopped by the police for speeding, I was delivering a bike. They fined me... Here it is... Look, commissioner. Can I smoke? No... You can go. Accompany this gentleman. Don't leave the area. -Okay. Since when did he work? -Is he really linked to the murder? Wake up man! -I do know he lost at billiards. On Beccha bridge? We're going for a little drive. -I'll tell uniform then. No, don't tell them. We'll do this alone. Get down and be quiet. May I have a cigarette? Smoke it. -I've always smoked... I lost the desire after taking all those pills... They're strong. -I don't have anymore. Aren't you going to light it? So you stole my lighter as well! -So what? I had a pack of Marlboros, I'd rather smoke them than this crap. I like them. You can keep the lighter as a memento. Hi, Paolo. -Ciao, Vittorio Is it all there? -If I say it's under I'll lose. I also have my clientel, what do I tell them? They'd realise how little I earn on this. Luckily I have other plans. -Tell Gino to lay low. He only thinks of billiards, I'm not dumb, I've got a family. I stink... I stink, I stink... If I don't wash I could die. The shower's broken, little water. -It's better than nothing... Let me use the bathroom, take me next door. Don't try anything stupid. -What do you mean... You're not even crazy, besides, you can watch me... ...Or do I make you sick? Come on, start walking. You never bath. It's freezing. Look at these hands! Come on, pass me the soap. Do you sunbathe naked? -On the boat, always. Sometimes we do too, but it's just the men, the women don't. You're from Calabria, how long have you been in the North. Not long. How come you're just a ruffian? -Who's a rufffian? Here in the north there's never enough money. That's why you ended up working for them. -What do you care? I don't... I really don't. But... -But what?! You're different to the other guy, the one who made me write the letter. Why should I be like him? We aren't brothers. Is it yours? -Yes. I'll wear it then. Were you sleeping? -No. Spaghetti and rice for a month. -A month! Don't let it get to you, I'm just talking. Just talking? Easy for you to say, you come and go as you please... I'm busting my balls, understood? -Be quiet, she might hear you. So what if she can! -What does that mean? They're messing us around, everyday it's a different excuse... Do they even have the money? -Of course, it's a matter of days. I'm going to the city tomorrow. -You're not going anywhere. Why not? Gino's in charge. -Gino can't move, I'm in charge. What happened to him? Has he been caught? Wake up! If he got caught we wouldn't be here talking. Gino's committed some small crime. -Well then? Well then... He's laying low, it's better for all of us. What about us? -Nothing changes for us... They substituted Gino for Vittorio. It's a matter of days, they'll pay up. Who is it? -I'm Paolo Torineri. Why did you come here? -It was my decision... No one is giving me any orders. -You have your orders, get back. I told you from the start, I've got family... ...We had a deal. It was only meant to last three days... What do I tell my wife now? -Tell her to mind her own business. If I'm out all night she might come looking for me. Then leave other people's wives alone. If you want out, then go. I don't want out, but now there's two of us the kid's getting angry. Hey Carletto, move from there. -I know, I know... We've got to finish cleaning. And Vittorio? -I met him yesterday. You'll see him again tomorrow morning. I'll leave it on the football. What does 'orchi nus' mean? -'Orchinus'... Like Moby Dick, a giant whale, they're very powerful. Is this game really interesting? -You bet! I've supported Juventus for 10 years, it's a great side. What's wrong? Tell me. You have to ask? I feel like an animal trapped in here. I've always treated you well. It's not my fault if...- -You mean it's my fault?! No, but... -But? Your father isn't paying! Has he got the money or not? -I'm not his accoutant... My father is... -Your father? Doesn't he love you? -Of course he does... ...We play tennis, go boating. Well then? -He's not my real father... I'm someone else's daughter, my real father's a famous writer. My mother told me, my dad probably doesn't even know. Will you kill me if they don't pay? -What are you saying? Are you capable of killing me? -Me! You can trust me... We're friends, right? -Don't talk rubbish. It's the truth... I swear it's the truth. I... I'm sure nothing will happen to you. I washed your clothes. Tinned meat again? It makes me sick! Come on, eat it. You're not very well organised. -What's that meant to mean? It means; nothing works in here anymore... They're just using you. They've gone to collect the ransom. -Yeah, right. They're using you and you know it, first one disappears, then another... The older ones always cheat, they'll rip you off as well, you'll see. How much did they promise you? My part. -You believed them? If they starve you like this now, think of what they'll do later. Whose side are you on? -Yours, you should know that. Let's escape together? -What are you saying? Who's going to stop us? You can trust me... We'll say they blackmailed you and we were prisoners together... You planned to escape but you were waiting for the right time. You'll make a fortune! -And they'll kill me. How? If they catch them. -Who'll catch them? They'll get us allright, but the guys up top, they'll never get them... Besides, they've been good to me. The life I lead, I could be killed at any moment. Forget it then... If you give me a glass of wine I might be able to eat this shit. Not drinking? Come on. Are you leaving? Lina? Lina? There's no more coffee. If they aren't back in 2 days; we'll escape together. Another two days? Tomorrow. Michele Torrisi, come out with your hands up! Come out with your hands up. -If you shout I'll kill you. Michele, where are you going? -Shut up! Don't do anything stupid, think about what you're doing. We'll give you five minutes. We know you're in there, surrender. Don't make it worse for yourself. We are giving you five minutes. I have to hide it, if they find it they'll shoot me. What's wrong? Don't worry, nothing will happen to you. Just tell them the truth... ...I've always helped you and we care for each other! Alice, I didn't know it was a kidnapping, I'm on probation... They'll give me two years, then we'll find each other. I've never seen you before, I don't even know who you are! Take this chain off my feet! -Have you gone mad? You evil scum bastard! I said take these chains off! Do as I say, come on! -Come out with your hands up. Alice, I really care for you... No! You go over there, the others come with me. Don't worry. It's all over, we'll take you home. Where's the key? The key to the lock? -He had it in his pocket. Him. -Hurry. This is hers. -Later, call an ambulance. He wanted to kill me, he came at me with the gun... I defended myself and it went off. -You haven't killed anyone... You haven't killed anyone. We shot him from the corridor... When he jumped, we shot him. I shot him, understand? I shot him. Let's go home now. Can you walk? Subtitled by a Jawa for Cinemageddon.
