Shamrock was incredible mounted on the back of Dynamite .. 46 seconds. In my opinion, it’s 45 seconds longer than any man who’s tried before. And if that weren't enough, And did more. Shooting with his two revolvers, hit all shots riding 50 yards. From what I heard, Shamrock made you look like a bunch of kids. He just knows how to show off. He would be worthless on the plain. His aim wouldn't work. And if there is a real shooting, it goes in the other direction. Aren't you saying that because you came in second, Tex? Madam, I would say that if you came in last. Shamrock is not worth the gunpowder he would use to blow it up. What do you say, Shamrock? We must? Nevermind. What did I tell you? Forget it. Let's have a drink. I don't want to drink. Why doesn't someone ask Shamrock, why does your gun have marks? He didn't even kill a rattlesnake. Go ahead. Withdraw. Why don't you do that? I'm not close to my gun. They're robbing the bank! Wait, guys. I think they ran away. You can get out of there. They left. He thinks he's brave, guys, but when... Still second best, huh, Tex? Relax, guys. It's Tex. Good job, guys. But it's a shame about Shorty. Yes. Well, that makes our part a lot bigger. There's your part, Tex. Now that I have it, I feel like I'm going to enjoy it. - I'll see you in two weeks. - Not so fast, Tex. - We have to do an extraction. - Extraction? What you mean? - Larabie's diligence, will send a large shipment of gold by Lawless. - Gold is what we will extract. - I understand what you mean. - Do you have a match? - It came from afar by a match. Well, you never know when you're going to make a fire. - Where you go? - That's with the horse. Where do you think you're going? I think my horse had the same idea as yours. I don't know where we're going, but I'll bet there. It is difficult to try to remember a man's name and not be able. I have him on the tip of my tongue, but I can't say it. It seems that I can improve if I can remember. You might be able to fix me. Can't remember anything that happened to you before the Navajos found you? That's right. The Navajos raised me, until I'm old enough to live alone. I later found out that this weapon belonged to my father. And that he was a famous deputy. What he doesn't understand is what he did at the age of six, in the middle of the desert with your father's gun. Yes. I just know that my parents and a son, who should have been me, left Fort Bridge on a Sunday morning, and were never seen again. Only that. But one day, I will remember what happened, between the departure of my family and the Indians meeting me. Go up and take the stagecoach to hiding. This will avoid the burden of carrying the gold. - Why did you run away from us? - They got Pat, didn't they? We couldn't have done anything. Furthermore, there may be more of them on the way. Hey, Lucky, this driver is seriously injured. Well, guys, don't stand still. Take him inside. What is the problem? Have you never seen a girl before? Yes ma'am. Oftentimes. - On the shoulder, huh? - Yes. Take it easy. - Support me. - That's right. I got him. Take it easy. - You better come in and help. - No, Lucky. I better drive. I have to get my horse. This will stop the bleeding until we reach the city. You were wonderful. If I hadn't shown up, we would be dead. It wasn't just me. My friend jumped on the stage. - Is your friend always shy like that? - Good... Usually when you're around a beautiful woman. I understand. What did they say they were called? We didn't say. My name is Lucky Hayden. My friend's name is Shamrock Ellison. The famous fitter and sniper. Now, if your friend is that good, is able to appoint you as a delegate, as soon as we get to the city. - What makes you think that? - Why will I make this happen. - What happened? - Attempted assault. - The driver was shot. - Call the doctor, quickly. - Ann, honey, are you okay? - Yes, father, I am. If it weren't for the two of them, I don't know what would have happened. Especially Mr. Ellison. He made a wonderful leap on top of the stage. That's great. I think I better go home now, dear. I'm going. I have a business to do. Okay, dad. Have a good time, gentlemen. And remember what I said about the delegate vacancy. What is this business about the delegate vacancy? Is nothing. She just said that this city, needs a new delegate. I think I know what my daughter meant. It's not a bad idea. Not even. Well, see you later, gentlemen. Hello, doctor. Looks like you got another memory, Clark. It was the most incredible thing I've ever seen. You should have seen how he hit that thug. And he still jumped on the stage. Hello, Deacon. It is better to send some of the boys back and get the body. I'll take care of that, Clark. The point is, things have gotten worse since you left, dear. That's what I've been trying to tell you, Dad. This city needs two men like Mr. Ellison and his friend. Maybe I'm right. I'm going for a walk around town. What for, Daddy? You said we need a new delegate, didn't you? - Yes, but... - I know what you're thinking. But I promise I won't drink. I swear to God. I've been a good boy since I left. You can ask anyone in town. Okay, Dad. But be careful. I'll be back as soon as we get a new delegate and an assistant. Good night dear. You must have heard of him. What is he called again? Shamrock Ellison. He is the greatest fighter in Arizona. - Have you heard of Billy The Kid? - Who hasn't heard? Let me tell you something. Billy The Kid left Texas because I heard that Shamrock Ellison had moved to Arizona. - He must be terrifying. - And that's not all. Black Bart surrendered as soon as he heard that Shamrock Ellison, had moved to California. Serve me. Deacon... found someone capable of taking on the delegate vacancy? From what I heard tonight, I think we have our man. IT IS? Who? Follow me. Forgive me for the intrusion, sir, but you can tell us, where to find your friend, Shamrock Ellison? Of course. In the hotel. Thank you sir. Hey, Colonel, you are a persuasive man. What do you think about going to talk to him? It will be a pleasure. Hey, what's going on? We're looking to make your friend Lawless's deputy. - No. - Yes. Serve me another one. I'll have a brandy. In between. Now, Colonel. I wasn't expecting you. Sit down. - Can I keep your hat? - Thanks. - How's Miss. Annie? - Very well, thank you. I don't know how to put it. I suppose you would call me, "one-man welcome committee". Deacon asked me to ask you if I would accept the honorable position of Lawless City Sheriff. I... I appreciate the honor, but I'm afraid I will have to refuse. Your partner was telling us about your achievements. In fact, he said that you would stay at Lawless, and we would be proud of that. Your kindness, Colonel, but I'm afraid my partner, confused our plans. We will leave for Utah in the morning. I'm sorry to hear that. I thank you for saving my daughter's life, and the Expresso safe. - I'm happy to help. - I'll see you again, Mr. Ellison. - Where did you get this gun? - She belonged to my father. Why? Was he called Sam Ellison? The notorious border delegate? That's right. Did you know him? I hope you enjoy your trip to Utah. It is a great place for you to go. It is with great pleasure that on behalf of my partner, and countryman, Shamrock Ellison, I accept this great honor in your honor. Also, as you did with Jesse James from Kansas, Shamrock will expel all outlaws from the state of Arizona. - I propose... - Just a moment, Lucky. - What are you trying to say... - Congratulations, Chief. Congratulations. Let's go guys! Let's give three cheers to Lawless's new deputy. Wait a minute! There must be a mistake. There is no mistake, my boy. Here you see several citizens from the city of Lawless. By unanimous vote, we decided that the American government, should appoint you as the new delegate. This badge belonged to David DuLong, who died the other day in premature death, while protecting the line of due diligence. He will give you the authority you need until the government gives you a new one. Look here, guys. I am not qualified to be a delegate. Isn't the man who scared Billy The Kid qualified? And when did you expel all those thieves from Oklahoma? - Yes. - Listen to me, please. That man who claims to be my partner, is the biggest liar that ever lived. I've never killed anyone in my life. That is not what the driver told us this afternoon. Modesty is a quality of all great men, but it’s unnecessary at the moment. You will have to give me a chance to think about it. - I'll let you know tomorrow morning. - This is fair. Well, Dad, it didn't take long. What is the problem? Didn't he take the job? It is better than not. What is wrong? He's the son of the man who killed my brother. - Did he murder you? - That's right. He took advantage of being a law enforcement officer. Bob was a careless boy. He may have shot around town, but he never hit anyone. But, Dad, I'm sure Shamrock... That's enough, Ann. Let me shake your hand, delegate. I am proud to meet you. My friend. Now... That's right. I did it for your own good. This is the best thing that could happen to you. It would be easier if you left me in my corner alone. You are not in this alone. If you want to know, I'll be your new helper. It's for you, delegate. "No delegate survived Lawless after sunset. I give until tomorrow night to leave. The cat." The cat. This looks familiar. I seem to know that name. I feel like everyone will know this in the city in the morning. - Looks like you're under arrest, right? - Yes. I am stuck. When the judge asked his age, he said he was 29. The judge said, "You will be 41 when you leave." - Deacon. - Good morning, Shamrock. If you haven't changed your mind, you've got a new delegate. Now, my boy. Yes sir. I will accept the job on one condition. Which one? Let Lucky Hayden appoint you as deputy. Whatever you say, delegate. Line up at the bar, guys. The drink is on me. Come on, delegate. Serve them, waiter. I see that the band of Gato will have work from now on. I heard that the new delegate is the best sniper on this side of the Mississippi. Who is this Cat? What's he like? We know as much as you, delegate. Nobody saw him. As soon as we think we take care of him, another one appears and takes his place. We only know that he is a cruel killer. I think we would like to meet you, wouldn't we? Yes. What is so funny? Am I wrong or did you say he is the new delegate? That's right. Come have a drink. It looks like we came to a safe little town, doesn't it? We'd better leave before that deputy scares me off. - Strange, you're insulting him. - That's right, sir. That was my intention. And this cowardly delegate he doesn't even have the courage to open his mouth and defend himself. - Did you hear that? - Who is this stranger? I think you owe me an apology. I want to see you make me, delegate. I suggest you don't serve. After all, this only leads to bloodshed. He is right. We would only waste good men. - What do you say strange? - Sure. I am willing to keep it for now. I never really liked to shoot hares. Well, guys, why don't we pick up where we left off? Sure. Let's have a drink. I still say that he is the bravest delegate I have ever met. The way he behaved facing the evil element. I pay. I hear there's only room for one more mark on his dad's gun. And he's saving it for someone special. I know what you mean. And I think he's being a fool. The greatest gunmen have tried to defeat the Cat. They're all dead. I don't know, the Cat hasn't faced him yet. If you were a gambling man. I would bet on the sheriff. - I raise, Brooks. - Maybe yes. what am i doing and how did it start? I think I can afford it. I'm saying. I can't go on like this. You doing all the work that I should do, and me getting thanks. Stop worrying. You will end up facing the Cat. Well, I think it's too late to give up now. The sooner you realize this, the better it will be for you. Are you sure this Cat guy will show up? He will be here. How many? Two. Three. I was told that the deputy saved a place in his gun, to someone special. They're talking about you, Cat. I thought they were gunmen. You look like children playing with guns. I'm doing my best. This is not good enough. I want you to take care of that man. - That must be easy, sir. - Who are you? My name is Tex. He brought me. What makes you think it will be easy to kill the deputy? I've known him for a long time. If you want to know, the sheriff is the one who has done all the work. Get rid of him and your problems will be over. Your job will be to take care of both. It's fine with me, but I charge a lot. You will be satisfied. Now, let's talk about business. - The next shipment of gold. - We already thought about it. We're going to town tonight and we'll have the Colonel drink. When the old man starts talking... Well, gentlemen, I think I drank enough tonight. Come on, old man, be social. We are not always in town. Well, you’re good company. - Let's sit and be accommodated. - This is a good idea. Tell me, Ann. Why doesn't your dad like me? Do not like? I did not notice. - He forbade me to come here. - He'll get over it. But it would help if he gave up the post of delegate. What's wrong with me being the delegate? My father thinks peacekeepers are just gunmen, hiding behind badges. - Someone has to do this. - I wish it wasn't you. I would hate to see you become a murderer, shooting others just because the law says it's right. Believe me, Ann. I would give up if I could. And if I could, I suppose it would go away? That depends. By the way, did you see my father tonight? He's... he's in the saloon. - Drinking? - I'm afraid so. I'm so worried about him. I wonder if... I will go there and see if I can get someone to send him home. - Good night, Ann. - Good night. You don't think I know what I'm talking about, huh? I can show you enough gold to scare you. You've been talking like that for years. Do you think I'm lying, huh? Well, it's coming from the mine to the Expresso office tonight. Look! Don't tell anyone that. Because only I know that. - And the deputy? - I don't say anything to him. I don't even speak to the deputy. You forget to drink, old man. I thought you were a friend of the deputy. What gave you that idea? He's been seen with his daughter, hasn't he? I told him to stay away from Ann. This is funny. I would swear I saw you heading towards your house when we arrived. - What do you say, Dick? - It was the deputy. - There is no doubt about it. - He can't do this to me. I'll take care of him. I will expel you from this city. Just a minute, old man. Don't you want a gun? I don't need a gun. I have that, don't I? I heard that deputy likes to shoot. You better take this to protect yourself. Hey, where are you going? Here, Colonel. Give me that gun. You can hurt someone. Leave me alone. I'm going to hunt a coyote. - But it is not in condition. - Leave him alone. He won't hurt anyone. It's all right. Go straight home to lie down. Sleep well. - Ellison. - Why don't you keep that gun before it accidentally fires? It won't be an accident when it is fired. I'll teach you not to mess with my daughter. Draw your weapon. You are letting the whiskey speak for you, Colonel. I will give you what your father gave my brother. Wait, Colonel. I don't want a problem. I told you to draw your gun, Ellison. Hit the gun in his hand. That was a dirty trick. Shoot a helpless old man. I aimed at his gun. I can't be wrong. You shoot badly. Hit him in the chest. Let's put it on that table. So, when I aimed at the Colonel's gun, I took a step to the side. It must have been when someone shot me, missed and hit the colonel. What makes you think he was trying to hit you? There are many men in this city who would like to shoot me. Thanks to you. Besides everything else, I was accused of shooting an old man. It is the Expresso office. This is your chance to show how to shoot. Let's go guys. We got it. Lucky? Lucky! Lucky, I'm better now. I remembered my parents. The Cat ambushed us. He murdered them both. I was scared so I hid in the cart. The Cat didn't see me. Lucky, is your injury serious? I'm not well. Only my ammo is gone. I had to do something while they were shooting at me, so I lay on the floor. Now, you... Go get them, Shamrock. Set up, men. I will form a possession. Me and Tex are going to the hideout. while the rest go to the rocks and attract possession. Where are the rest of the men? They took the other way to attract possession. We brought the gold. Good job, guys. Good job. That's right. And we work hard too. I want my share double. So, our friend from Texas is full of ideas. Brave man, huh? You better be careful or you won't get anything. What I mean is: we wait for the morning, do we take the gold and hide? That's a good idea, Tex. For you. But I personally like it here and I will stay. Right. Go there! They're coming quickly. We will protect ourselves on these rocks. Watch out, guys! Spread out! So, are you the Cat? I suppose you don't remember me after 20 years. Don't be so scared, Deacon. I will give you more chance than you gave my parents. At least, you will have a trial. Hands up. Where's the gold? Dick and Tex took it to the hideout. - Where is the hideout? - Rim Far Canyon. Well, delegate, and I'm serious, delegate, it looks like you didn't need help after all. Nobody deceives old Lucky. I knew he was the Cat. Say "meow" to him, Deacon. He's the Cat. That's what I said? That's what I said. It is the first time I made a mistake. So it was Cat that killed my brother? I think I was wrong about you, Shamrock. Forget it, Colonel. I'm sorry for having to go to Utah. I always wanted to see what the State of Utah is like. You know, from the way you arrested Cat and his gang, I wouldn't be surprised if you were elected governor. - Governor? Did you say "governor"? Yes. So Shamrock Ellison is the right man. I'll never forget when Sam Houston called Shamrock, to help you in the battle of the Poplar. And when he shot Buffalo Bill while hunting buffalo. There he was, completely surrounded... Wait a minute, Lucky. That was nothing. Tell them about the time I helped George Washington. George Washington? Sure. There they were. George Washington said, to Shamrock Ellison: "Shamy, my boy. We can win this... " I don't think I know what I'm saying. Translation Editing and Synchronization by WesternKasa / GM NOV2020
