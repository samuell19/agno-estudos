Lunch break! Come on! Are you already tired, Kaliman? FIREFLIES You're early, Aladdin. When did you arrive to Veracruz? You're not having a good time? Where do you want to go? He says Greece or Turkey. That's far. It'll cost you a lot of money. But, lot of money... How much? Thirty. Wow. He says he can give us seven, and pay the rest with work. No, I'm too tired. Yeah, since earlier today. Who's gonna be there? No, I'm sure it'll be fun, but... Hey, you didn't tell me about your test... What happened? How was it? You have to take it again? I know. Because you didn't study! Hold on a sec. Hello. You came back. Your room! Give me a second. Yeah... It's already been cleaned. No, pay me tomorrow. Tomorrow... You can pay me. Thank you. Are you alright? - Go ahead. - Goodnight. Hey... Yeah, a guest... The leaves on the ground are all dry. The tree I can see from my window... it seems to be naked. Just like I am here naked... waiting for you... Waiting for you to come back to me. But I know that you will never come back around here. You've always done what you wanted. And I'm here, like before... But worse. I don't understand the meaning of everything that's happening. It's as if I don't exist anymore. What are you watching, uncle? So early in the morning? It's awful. That's why you never go out anymore. The trucks were abandoned on the road, and the bodies were spread out on the pavement, and the authorities did not move them. The Chief Prosecutor... Here. How about a beer? Forget the beer. Drink your coffee. Seven of the bodies have been identified through Plataforma Mexico... All of them had a criminal record. What is going on in Veracruz? The governor Javier Duarte, doesn't like people to talk about the insecurity, or to question the increase of violence in the state, but something is taking place, and the authorities have to... We will all have fun! Like every year, we will be waiting for you! Carnival is here! The most exciting Carnival in the world! In two weeks... Dancing and games... Carnival is here! Fun for the whole family! Costumes and dancing! Don't miss it! Carnival is here! Come on! We are waiting for you... Hello... Hessam? Hello... Hi... I'm glad you got my message. What time is it over there? Why can't I see your video? Give me a second to try it... The connection here is awful... Seems you've forgotten that. It's been so long. Where did you disappear to? Why are you so agitated? I'm right here. Here. How are you, my dear? Are you okay? I've been thinking about you a lot. - I miss you. - Why don't... Why don't you answer any of my messages? My phone... oh, my phone, forget it. I think about you every day. You know that. Tell me what you are up to. Nothing. Tell me. Really? You really want to know? Nothing. I've been worried about you. And I still am, but you don't... Hello? Okay. Don't be angry. I can't see you worked up like that. Okay? I just want us to be able to talk. Are you enjoying it there? What do you do? Just working hard. That's all. Come on! Don't lie. What do you think I'm doing out here? I don't know, but I don't believe that you are just working. You don't tell me anything about your life there. How would I know? Hello? - Hello? - Hello. Are you listening to me? - Yes, I heard you! - So? So, you want me to tell you that I go out with other guys? Damn you, Hessam. Are you still there, in that port? Yeah. Is it far from Mexico City? They say it's really fun there. I don't know. I wank to stay here, close to the boats. Why the boats? I'm trying to get back to Turkey. Have you gone crazy? Why? What's wrong with you? You don't like it there? You're not happy there either? Don't start again with that! You're always the same. You make me feel bad all the time. You have no idea what my life has been like here. What I've been through these last few months. Hello? Hello. What are you doing? Give me that. Move over. There you go. Hit it. This city is hot, you get me? Hot! You can get stuck here easily, you get me? Where are you from, homey? Where? Oh, like Iraq. No... I don't know it. A cousin of mine from Los Angeles... he went to Iraq. The fucking Americans took him there as a soldier, and he stayed... He got killed there, homey. Killed, you get me? Killed, dead. My buddy... he's from Honduras. Veracruz... you like it? Anything is better than the shit we left behind, no? Anyway, I'm not staying here. I have a buddy waiting for me there. That's where I'm going. What's up with you? Where are you going? You have to think about where you're going, homey. If not, you may end up staying here... Veracruz, this fucking place is like a black hole, you get me? He's crazy, man. It's ready! What did you make? Your favorite. Seafood soup. Delicious. Will you open the beer? How did you prepare it? With octopus or clams? With clams, my mom's recipe. Your mom was an expert. How is it? Good. Have you heard? What? It seems like Ernesto is coming. What? Maybe it's just gossip. And who told you this gossip? I can't remember. So why are you telling me? It doesn't affect me anymore. Don't you feel like seeing him? What for? Anyway, nobody told me. Why are you looking at me like that? Don't be so difficult. For me, it's all over. He could be dead. What difference does it make? - What's up? - Hey. Give me one. Damn it, Rosy. Why didn't you tell me anything? About what? About Ernesto. Oh, that. He called a few days ago. I didn't even have time to tell you. Why is he coming back? What do I know? My mom talked to him. I don't want to see him. Then don't. He's an asshole. When does he arrive? In a few days. Next week. I don't know. Fucking hell! Forget him! You don't need him. I didn't think it would affect me like this. I wasn't expecting it. What's that? Fuck it... It's nothing! Fuck, Rosy! Again? Don't say anything to my mom, okay? What the fuck? How can you stay with that guy? I don't give a shit. I'm gonna tell her. Don't do anything stupid! Anyway, I'm leaving soon... To Cancun? Yeah, man. I have it all planned. What the hell will you do there? There's lots of places where I can dance. And besides... The men there are more classy. Not like the shit here. They're all the same. You'll see. Hurry up, little thing... You're up next. See you soon. And just try to forget about my brother. You should've seen that guy... I have to go, but I already paid you in full... - Bye. - See you later. - Hello You're going to pay? How many days? You'll leave when it's time, no? I'm a bad teacher. I don't have any patience. Nope. What for? The photo? That one? He is my great grandfather. You know? Great grandfather? Oh, he was from Lebanon. From your part of the world. Lebanon? He arrived here very young. Then he married a Mexican woman.. From Veracruz, and then stayed here. Alright. But, only a little. A little. A little. Well... It's a deal. Bye. Hey, dawg. See you around, Cuyo. - What's up? - What's up with what? A beer or something. I can't, man. Gotta do something. - See you in a bit, dawg. - Ok, man. Alright, dude. Hey, dude! What are you up to now? What will you do? It's a good hour, dude. Don't you want to go to the beach? Go for a swim, dawg? Come on. Come on, Ramin! Just to cool down a bit. What happened to you, homey? Those are some mad scars! What do you mean, nothing? Whoa! “El reclusorio”, homey. Yes, "reclusorio”. In your country? In Iran? Whoa... Why did they lock you up, homey? Look. Look, homey. Touch it. Touch it. Look, I have them here, there... I'm full of them. You see? I have them all over. Touch it. When they initiated me... They hit me hard in the head, you get me? So hard that they left me unconscious. When I woke up, I was part of something. You get me, homey? I was part of the family. But two years later, my own brothers betrayed me, homey. They betrayed me and filled me with lead all over and left me to die. What do I know, homey? Those jerks said that I was working for the police. It was a lie, you get me? I almost died, but I got up. And you know what? I like these scars, homey. I like these scars because they tell my story. These scars give us personality, homey. If God wills, I'll be showing everyone that I'm out of this shit, you get me? I'm a person who can have a new life. Let's go. What? You have a phone call. Why didn't you answer? It's too early. Who is it? It's Ernesto. Tell him I'm not here. I already told him you're home. Then tell him that I'm in the shower. Wait, I'm coming. Yes? Hello. When did you get back? No, everything is fine. Yeah. Today? I'm very busy today. No, he rarely goes out. But at what time? Of course I remember where it is. I'll try to make it. Alright. Yeah. Same to you. Goodbye. How do you say, "My name is Ramin"? Name... is... Ramin My name is Ramin. Then I could say... What will you do today? Damn it. I go... to the center... for buying. To shop. Now you can ask me... And you Leti, what is doing today? No, it's "what will you do today”? What will you do today? I have to go somewhere. Where? My boyfriend... My ex-boyfriend... came back. You know? From the USA. Okay... I'll say something in English... I don't know what he came back for. He left for a long time. And never called me. Sure you don't want to come? I have nothing to talk about with those people. It wouldn't kill you to go out a bit. You're pretty. You look nice. Surely you'll come home late. Oh, come on. No... I'll come home early. Enjoy yourself. See you later. Be careful I can't remember where it was. - Here's some tortillas. - Thanks, mom. Come on, have some meat! - What was the name of that place Rosy? - Where? Over by Hotel Mocambo, where we would swim as kids. I don't remember. It was a place with rides and games... but not like the ones today. - What's up, sista? - Hey... Yeah, older. Tell them how it went when you came back, son. When I was on my way back the guy said... “Senor, is this all you are taking?” Yeah, but if I had more stuff, would you let me through quicker or what? And that's what you used to fuck? What's so funny over there? Let's hear the joke. What's wrong, Brian? He's tired... Take him to the room 50 he can sleep. Why me? Tell mom to do it. Damn lazy girl. Right? Another beer? Something stronger, no? Follow me. Look at that boat, homey. I already have my plan to cross the border, homey. It's not easy to cross the border, dude. You need a guide, you get me? So? Where will you go? I won't stay in Los Angeles. I'm going further north. Up to Canada, you get me? I'm gonna be a construction worker; start another life. Have a real job. Oh yeah? So? Why are you here, homey? Are you crazy, dawg? You're lost! You're crazy, dawg! I'll start calling you Christopher Columbus! Sit down. You're insane, dawg. Here, no one looks behind them. Here, everything is forward, moving ahead. All those guys, they are looking ahead. What are you thinking? I have nothing here. None of us has anything. That's why I left, why I'm here, why I'm moving forward. I'm not going back. Go. I are not... ...ready? Can you give to me... .time more? No, it's I “am” not ready. Remember? And... "Can you give me more time?” For example... What will you do tomorrow? What's wrong? I want... to leave. Where? Cheers. Cheers. Do you like it? It's Danzén. My uncle was really good... Professional. And here in the hotel... The competition in Veracruz. C'mon. Come on. I'll teach you. I'm not so good but... You have to make a square. Like this. Hold me tight, ok? Really good. Now turn. And here... It's so hot... Let's try again. You only move the hips. Don't move this part. I look at the horizon. And you look over there. But, not with a zombie face. Just normal. Hey, I want to leave. Then go. - Ramin? -I don't know. What's up? How are you? Hey. What's up? What are you doing? Nothing. Can I talk to you? Sure. I'm going back. To where? To Texas. Thanks for coming to let me know. Brian will stay here. Really? It's too much for me right now. I need to put my life in order. And his mom? It's complicated. Okay, wow... I don't want to know. Who will take care of him? Rosy, I guess. Oh really? You think so? I wouldn't count on that. Anyway, I'll send them money each month. I don't give a shit what you do with your life, Ernesto. You've changed so much, man. And why does Rosy have to take care of your mess? That's between me and my family. So why are you telling me about it? Good luck over there. Take care. I have to go. Did you like it, Ramén? Yes, a lot. It's Ramin, uncle. I know... But, I will call him Ramon. You don't mind, do you? You want some? No, thanks. Well, I'm going to watch TV. Good night. Rest. Thank you for dinner. It's nothing. You're going out? Thanks a lot. Good night. Hey dude. C'mon, dawg. I have my ride... everything's ready. What's wrong, brother? Be happy, dawg. You're also gonna leave... to Turkey, or who knows where. Well, you're free to do what you want, homey. What's wrong with you, dude? Come on. Relax already. C'mon, have a drink. To smoke. Do you have another one? What's up with you, homey? You're not gonna say anything or what? Cat got your tongue or what? I don't want you to go. What? It's gonna be okay. You're my friend. What's wrong with you? Fucking faggot. What's up, homey? Whoa... You live comfortably, homey. Let's see. Let me see it. Why not? Let me look at it, homey. You wrote all this, homey? It's strange... what does it say? Let's see. You wrote this? Whoa, dude. Who is this? Your brother, or what? Here you go. You don't want it? I told you I'm not a faggot. Fucking faggot! What did you think? Don't look at me! Don't look at me! What do you want? I told you I'm not a faggot. This used to be a prison. First, it was a fortress. To keep the pirates out. You like it? Yes. What are you saying? You're crazy! - Are you sure? - Yes! All these boats are the same, Ramin. Gosh! I don't believe you... Everything okay? It's your first Carnival! Enjoy it! Hey, throw a coin, and I'll get it. Throw 2 coin and make a wish... Five or 10 pesos. Over here. Five or 10 pesos, throw it. I'll get it... throw it. Here it is... Thanks!
