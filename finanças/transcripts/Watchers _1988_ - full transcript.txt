Updating tonight's lead story, let's go back to Banodyne Laboratories and Dan O'Dowd. As you know, Bob, the explosion was enormous. That, coupled with the intense fire that followed, virtually destroyed the whole lab. Any word on what caused the explosion, Dan? Nothing as yet, but it is speculated here that... it was due to some faulty wiring... in a room containing cleaning materials. Dan, it's known that Banodyne has conducted... classified biological research for the National Security Organization in the past. Any reason for our viewers to be concerned? No, Bob, none whatsoever. The N.S.O. has issued a statement... assuring us that the fire poses no health hazard to the public-- that although the research animals which were kept here have been destroyed, absolutely no toxic elements or radioactivity... have been released into the atmosphere. Who escaped? What makes you think anything lived through that? You called me. If you wanted to know who blew the place up, you would've got Phelan or Davis. You called me because I know Banodyne. - G-H-3. - The dog? Of course. He would've smelled the explosives. And one of the Oxcoms. Number 7. Always the bad seed. Cliff Soams is our local agent. Keep him on a need-to-know basis. The dog still transmitting? Yes. Are the Oxcom and the dog still telepathically linked? On a bio-frequency that only the Oxcom can receive. We have a maximum of 72 hours before the Oxcom kills the dog... and anyone with it. You know, whoever blew up Banodyne did you a big favor. This Oxcom project's been a total disaster. Disaster? No. Behind schedule, over budget, results we never expected, but certainly not a disaster. Imagine 20 Oxcoms in the field... tracking their prey ceaselessly, gorging on their quarry, growing stronger with every kill, drawn by a dog that insinuates itself into the enemy's camp. An innocent dog-- Yeah, well, that's a nice scenario. But there's one big problem. The Oxcoms keep killin' the dogs. There are defects. We'll solve them on the next go-round. You just find them and bring them back. What if they don't wanna come back? Do your job. Travis! I'm sorry. I'm sorry! I-I know. It was very immature of me. I agree. I agree with you. I'll make it up to you. I will. Help me. I can't get it undone. What is that? My dad. Again? Again. Yes. You have to go. You have to go. I love you. Bye. Damn it, girl! What are you doin' out here? Sorry, Dad. I heard the horses and came out. Uh-huh. That boy ain't out here again, is he? What boy? The Cornwell boy. It's Cornell. Uh-huh. That's the one. No, Daddy, I'm just checking the horses. I'm gonna get Nell some sweet feed to calm her down. Well, do that, then get back in the house. You got school tomorrow. - Tomorrow's Saturday. - Yeah, right. Well-- Hi, Nell. Hi, baby. Back. Good girl. Travis? What are you doing now, Travis? My dad could come back. Travis? You were right. You are immature. Oh, shit! Hmm? Hey, come on. Come on. Out of my truck. Where did you come from? Now what are you doing? Damn. Look, come on. Look, I don't have a driver's license. This isn't gonna look that good-- me standing out here all alone... talking to a dog. Come on. Move in. Hey, you know, you are one pushy dog. Yeah, well, I guess you're hungry. Yeah, go ahead. Eat 'em. This is pretty ridiculous, don't you think? - What? - Well, if this thing is as vicious as you say it is, what the hell are we gonna do with it once we find it? - Throw a net over it? - Maybe. Agent Johnson, call for you, sir. Thanks, Donnie. Johnson here. Right. That was Washington. Let's go. They haven't taken the head yet. There were a whole bunch of really strange footprints around it. I don't think we're gonna find the eyes. Keep it down, Porter. Poor child. Her mom died last year. Now her dad. You know, when Fish and Game wanted to reintroduce the grizzly in this area, most of these ranchers were dead against it. I wrote a letter. Didn't do no good. You can't tell the government anything. I don't think this was a grizzly, Sheriff. This thing has Sasquatch written all over it. Sasquatch? You know-- the Abominable Snowman. Porter, when are you gonna grow up? There ain't no Tooth Fairy, there ain't no Santa Claus, and there ain't no Sasquatch. Well, why would a grizzly rip a man's eyes out? Who the hell's this? How you doin'? Lem Johnson, National Security Organization. This is Cliff Soams. N.S.O.? Who called you? Uh-huh. Excuse me. Can I have a look at that, please? Okay. Thank you. Is she a witness? Yeah. She's his daughter. Cliff? Get her to a hospital and arrange security. Hold on a minute. You just can't walk in here and take over. Sheriff, if you check, I think you'll find some instructions from your governor. Now, I'm gonna need all the cooperation I can get. Lem? Excuse me. Hey, watch those footprints. You don't mess up my crime scene. Come take a look at this. That the Oxcom? Yeah. And that's our dog. Look, this would never work out. I gotta let you go. My mom would never let me keep ya. Besides, I'm all out of snacks. Except for a, uh-- a candy bar in the glove compartment. What are you, a circus dog? Wait. Do you want me to unwrap it for you? Okay. No problem. I'll split it with you, okay? I just want a little, little bite. Little bite. It's really-- It's mine. You're really cute. Nice bed, huh? This is my dad's. Yeah. You like it? Yeah. Okay. You sleep here tonight, okay? Good night. No. Come here. Come here. Come here. Look, my mom will never let me keep you. So, just till I can figure something out, stay here, okay? Okay? All right. Stay. Good night. Hey. Thanks for wakin' me up. Wait a second! What are you doing? How'd you get in here? Travis? My mom! She can't find you here! Honey, can I come in? Mom, now, I know that I shouldn't have driven the truck yesterday. I don't wanna talk to you about the truck. Look, Mom, I already know how to drive. Just because I don't have my license-- I have to talk to you about something. I just got a phone call... about Tracey. There's been an accident. An accident? Yeah. She's in the hospital. Sorry, folks. You can't go in there. Is this where Tracey Keeshan is? There's no visitors allowed up here. Why is that? - I wanna see my girlfriend. - I can't allow that. Couldn't we just see her for a moment? You see, the kids are very close. - Hey! Come on. - Hey, where is she? Come on! Who are you? I'm Tracey's boyfriend. I was with her last night. Well, I can see why you'd be concerned then. We had to move her to another facility for observation. I don't know what's going on here, but I'm sure that Tracey could use her friends right now. Where is she? She's okay. She's suffering from shock. We've had to sedate her. Are you people doctors? Look, we'd be more than happy to let you know when Tracey's well enough to have visitors. - Get off, man! - Now, why don't you just give us... your name, address and phone number, and we'll get back to you. Those guys had guns under their coats. Come on. Why would they have guns? 'Cause they're not doctors. Well, they didn't say they were doctors. They got Tracey. They said that. Isn't this getting just a little weird to you, Mom? I mean, it is to me. That was them right there. Well, what do you want me to do, follow them? No. This is where they kept them. Any word on the device that triggered the explosion? No, and I doubt there ever will be. The people that did the job were top notch. Jesus. Look at those bones. Oxcom 18-- outside experimental combat mammal. There were seven. Now there's only one. Well, it's kind of nice to know that in the future, though there may still be wars, we won't have to fight them. Well, that's progress, isn't it? It's gonna be kind of hard to catch the one that got away. The ultimate predator. We've just gotta be smarter than it is. How smart is this thing? How smart's a crazy person? I almost forgot about you, Furface. Now, I got big problems. I mean, stuff that dogs don't understand. Okay, I'm sorry. You do understand, okay? Travis? Who are you talking to? Him. - I was talking to him, Mom. - I don't understand. What's this? Oh. It's, uh-- It's a dog. Yeah, I see that, Travis. It's a golden retriever. He's also filthy. And he doesn't belong here. No, thank you. I don't wanna shake a paw. Look, Mom, I mean, he's really sensitive, and he is also the smartest dog that I have ever seen. Honey, if he is so smart, he can find his way home. No, I don't think he can find his way home, because I found him in the back of my truck on the way home from Tracey's. We can't keep him, Travis. I have to work. You have to go to school. Who's gonna look after him? Look, Ma, he can take care of himself. All right, just watch, okay? All right, Furface, there's a pack of hot dogs in the-- in the refrigerator, and if you go down there and you get them, you can have one. Watch. Come on. And you thought I was lying to you, Ma. That hurts. You know, I usually don't bathe my friends, Furface. I mean, I consider you more of a friend than a dog. You don't mind if I call you a dog, do you? Nah. I mean, you look like a dog, you smell like a dog. I mean-- Okay, you're definitely a dog. It's just weird is all. I mean, it's like you can understand everything we say. I'm worried about Tracey. I know they have her somewhere. Wanna help me find her? You do? Yeah? All right. Cool. We'll be like, uh-- We'll be like the Delta Force. Yeah. You know, my dad was in Delta Force. Taught me some real cool tricks. Well, I haven't seen him since my mom and him split up. What's this? G-H-3? Is that your name? G-H-3. G-H-3. It's-- It's a code. It's a code. You're a research animal. That's why you're so smart. What's in this ear? Nothing. This tape was made during Banodyne's recent tests... on Oxcom 7. Oxcom 7 remains obsessed with killing the dog and removing its ocular orbs, a situation witnessed in the deaths of both... G-H-1 and G-H-2. The project team hoped that they would see a dramatic lessening... of the Oxcom's pathological hatred of G-H-3. This the one that got out? Uh-huh. The most advanced of the Oxcoms. The most successful gene weave. Whether that hatred was caused by sibling rivalry... and jealousy over the affection the dogs received from staff, or a DNA crossover in the symbiotic bonding process... as the geneticists believed, the treatment failed. The third phase of the St. Francis project has achieved-- The Oxcom and the dog, they're like brothers. How do you mean? They share genetic material that was used in their creation-- the Oxcom, the dog and a third experiment. Was the Oxcom's hate for the dog a mistake? Yes. Totally. No one knows why... he ended up absolutely hating the dog. The dog was like a homing device, the creature, a search-and-destroy missile. It would've been the perfect weapon had it worked. Born of fire. Consumed in flames. Oh, here it is. I'm gonna call the paper. I'll put in an ad and find out who this guy belongs to. I don't believe it. It, um, looks like he doesn't like where he belongs, Mom. How did he do that? It's almost like he understands everything we're saying. He-He does understand everything we're saying. All right, um, for "yes," bark once, and for "no" bark twice. Do you understand? - See? - Okay. If you're so smart-- Let's see. Tell me, which one is a deer? Very lucky. Is this a deer? Right. No. Is it a house? No. All right. Is this George Washington? No. Is it Abraham Lincoln? I rest my case. Can you tell me the Gettysberg Address? Come on, Mom. Look, he's a genius. I have to keep him. Honey, if he's a genius, he's obviously very valuable. He belongs to somebody. No, obviously he does not belong to anybody, or he wouldn't have just hopped in the back of my truck when I was at Tracey's, right? You know what happened at Tracey's, don't you? Do you-- Do you know where Tracey is? Now they messed up my fish. Damn kids. Come out of my bus! I'll kick their butts this time. Come out of there! Hey, just a minute. Where do you think you're going? School, Mom. Where else? School? With the dog? You're taking the dog to school? Yeah, right. I wanna show the guys how smart he is. Travis, dogs aren't allowed in school. All right, Mom, look. I'm not going to school. I have to find Tracey. You're not going to look for Tracey. Look, Ma, Furface can help me. Travis, I'm sure Tracey's all right. The people at the hospital wouldn't let anything happen to her. Ma, the people at the hospital had guns. I don't care what you think they had. Now put the dog in your room and get to class. And don't think you can wait till I drive off and then go where you please. I'm gonna call you at school, and if you're not there Furface goes. You know, I'm really disappointed in you, Mom. I really am. What's up, dude? Hey, what's happenin'? Sorry to hear about Tracey's dad. Is she all right? I don't know, man. They won't let me see her. That's weird. Hey, man, we're going up to Dalberg's bus to bug him for a while. Yeah. I can't take one more day of that computer class. Teacher's a real dweeb. Wanna come? Uh, no, thanks, guys. I got enough problems as it is. - I'm just gonna go to class. - All right, man. See you later. Catch you guys later, huh? Take it easy. Come on, piggy! Sweat a little! Get a haircut, goof! Think of it as exercise. Burn off some of that baby fat. Positive to positive, negative to negative. 'Round and 'round and 'round she goes. Where she stop-- Ow. Fuck! Well, blimey. There is a Santa Claus after all. Hello. Hi. Is Mrs. Cornell here, please? What, you mean Nora? No, no, she's not in. Uh, Ted Hockney. I'm taking care of her appliances, if you know what I mean, mate. Is Travis here? No, he's just off to school. I wanna talk to him about his girlfriend. Tracey Keeshan. Yeah, I heard about that. It's a tragedy, eh? Tragedy. What's the world coming to? You want a cuppa? Well, uh, you want me to tell him somethin'? No. I'll come back. Just tell him I dropped in. Does Travis have a dog? No, no pets. He had a snake once, but Travis let it go. He's a good lad. Hates to see anything suffer. Nice talkin' to you. Yeah, sure. All right. Did anyone see you? Well, I guess so. Really? Ahhh. Isn't he cute? - Should we let him in? - Sure. Why not? Hey, pooch. Hey, pooch. Anderson. Good. Brooks. Class! Brooks. Hmm. Very good work, Miss Brooks. Yes. I wish everyone in the class... would have done as well as Miss Brooks here. Very nice work. Very nice. Thank you, Miss Brooks. Thank you, sir. Cornell. Are you all right, Travis? You seem a little distracted. Oh, no, I'm fine. I hope you take my class seriously, young man. Sure. Of course I do, sir. Good. Thank you. You idiot! Get down! What are you trying to do, get me in trouble? - Haskell? Holy shit! Did you type that? Travis! You stay after school! What the hell is goin' on? Maybe old man Dalberg got busted for all that weed he was growin'. Aah! Aah! Willie, check for tire tracks. Hey, let's get out of here before someone sees us. Yeah, good idea, man. The eyes are gone, just like at Bill Keeshan's. Yo, Johnson, I want a word with ya. Of course, Sheriff. What happened? Well, I thought I'd ask you that question. Two murders occur in my district, and the N.S.O. appears. Now what's goin' on? Naturally, our information's classified, Sheriff. We'll know more once we've run some tests. But, uh, I'd like to offer any N.S.O. assistance you might need to track down leads. Don't patronize me. I don't know what the N.S.O. has to hide, but this is my county, my responsibility. Look, Sheriff, we've both got jobs to do. Now let's try and stay out of each other's way. You guys shouldn't leave me behind like that. You're gonna hang with us, you gotta learn to keep up. - Hey, it's gettin' late. - So? - So maybe we should go. - No, maybe you should go. It's not like we wouldn't be able to catch up to ya. Go ahead, man! Go ahead, piggy! We'll give you a ten-second head start! One thousand one, one thousand two, one thousand three, one thousand four! We lied, piggy! Here we come! Ha-ha! We're gonna get you, man! Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Run, piggy! Where'd he go? This way, man. Come on. Shit! What the hell was that? Go, piggy! Go! Look behind us, man! Go, piggy! Get out of the forest! It's after us! Go! Go, piggy! Come on, man! Move it! Faster, piggy! Get out of the woods, man! Go to the right, man! Yes! You stay there. Here, sir. Wow. This is better than usual work. Uh, yeah, thanks. The dog helped a little. Hmm. "Danger N.S.O." What kind of danger is N.S.O., Furface? I mean, look, they're not dangerous. They're part of the government. Where'd you learn how to type? Travis? Travis, is that you? Sheriff's office. It's the maintenance man here at the school! What-- You're the maintenance man? What's go-- That's right, the high school. Look, I'm in the basement at the high school. There's a big problem out here. There's something terrible goin' on! There's hollerin' and screamin' and-- Just hold on now. Take it easy. It's like someone's bein'-- Hello? Hello? Hello? What is it? Maintenance man over at the high school. He was screamin'. If it's important, he'll call back. Let's go. Downstairs! Porter! Porter! Five gruesome murders and the disappearance of three teenagers... in the last 48 hours have the people of this quiet town-- We're not gonna be able to keep a lid on it this time. Look at that-- all the newspapers, TV, radio out here. Look, we'll leak it through the usual rumor mill. What, a bear? No, a psycho killer. It'll make the whole official "No comment" much easier. How can you have no-- You! My partner's dead! She's had her eyes ripped out... because we didn't know what we were up against! Now, you tell me what the N.S.O. was into, what it's gotten us into! I can't tell you. Fine! Either you talk to me, or I talk to the press. Either way, I'm gonna get to the bottom of this. Get out of here. Hey, I'll talk to you. But not here. Listen. Can you hear them? What? Huh? The crickets. They're talking to each other. Johnson, I don't have the time, and I'm in no mood. Now what the hell happened? This got something to do with what went on down at Banodyne? Yes. We called it the Francis Project. St. Francis of Assisi was a monk who had an affinity with animals. He could communicate with them. And we were developing new animals, animals with extraordinary mental abilities, animals with extraordinary physical powers. You mean like this thing that killed Keeshan and my partner? You mean it's intelligent? Yes. Well, why doesn't somebody reason with it? Can't you control it? It's gotta be stopped. It's experimental. It has a mind that can reason, but it's never been right emotionally. - What do you mean? - It's disturbed... and insane. Well, there's gotta be some kind of a pattern to this thing's actions. It's after a dog. A dog? A golden retriever. It was another experiment. Like the creature, it has some human genetic material. It's almost human in its intelligence. Almost. You bastards! The goddamn government thinks it can do any goddamn thing it likes. Is that all there is? Huh? These two animals? When we catch them, is it gonna be over? Sure, Walt. Everybody'll stop making weapons, and then there'll be peace on Earth. Walt? What? ? I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts ? ? There they all are standing in a row ? I'm very tired. I've had a really rough week. ? Big ones Small ones ?? My feet are killing me. Oh, here. I'll massage your feet. Oh, no, no, no, no. That's okay. No, I don't mind, really. You don't have to do this. No, really, I don't mind. You know, the nerves from all over your body... terminate in the soles of your feet. Mm-hmm. Yeah. This here's your spleen. And this is your liver. Over here is your kidneys. Yeah. Ow! Oh, oh, oh, oh. And down here are your bladder-- Okay, okay. That's enough. Well, it's good for ya. It stimulates the circulation. Yeah. Yours or mine? Both! It stimulates our circulation. Hockney, I'm, uh-- I'm just not in the mood for this. Gor. Why is it women don't like sex as much as men? Can you tell me that? If I can just figure out that one little thing-- Hockney, you know, there's a picture of you in the dictionary... under the word "incorrigible." It pays to advertise. I know what's gonna turn your lights on, love. That part for your dryer came in. Oh, great. Yeah, I fixed it. Hi, honey. Blimey, you do have a dog. Yeah, why? Well, some fellow was by asking if he had a dog. Some stiff bureaucratic bloke from NASA. N.S.O. Oh, yeah, that's it. N.S.O. I was wonderin' why some space fellow would be wonderin' about a dog, unless it was from some astronaut thing. God knows the way things are around here, what with that policeman and that teacher bein' murdered down at your high school. Wait. A teacher was murdered at the high school? Well, who did it? Well, I don't know. Same psycho killed Bill Keeshan. Oh, yeah. That's what the fellow was by askin' for. He wanted to tell you somethin' about Tracey and to ask you about your dog. Hey, what's, uh-- what's goin' on then? Nothing. Nothin'. Nothin'. Not a thing. Not a thing at all. Uh, I gotta go upstairs. - I have to talk to you. - Okay, I'll be down in one minute. You know, every place we go this thing shows up. It's after you, isn't it? It went to Tracey's, and it went to the school. It's comin' here next, huh? Yeah. So that's the danger you're warning me about. All right, so, then we have to get out, then Mom will be safe. Go. If there's some kind of trouble, I can help. Look, Nora-- Uh, just a minute, Hockney. Travis? Oh, bloody hell. Here. Have a look at this, love. Now, just give me a minute, now. Have a look at this. I'll be back. Oh, bloody hell! Travis! What the hell is going on? The N.S.O. has got Tracey. What? And that-- that thing that's killing everybody wants the dog. I'm not giving him up, Ma. I'm not gonna let him down, and I'm not gonna turn myself in. Honey, whatever this thing is, we're in this together, okay? Okay. Hey, what's the matter? What's wrong, boy? Hockney? Are you here? Hockney? Hello? What the hell? What happened here? Hockney? Oh, my god. Mom, we gotta get out of here. Go! Upstairs! Furface! Lock the door! Get in the closet! Get out! Hurry! Come on! Furface, jump! Jump! Come on! Get the truck! Damn it. All right, Ma. Go. Go! We have to do somethin', Ma. Yeah. Psycho killer-- who is it, and where will he strike next? The latest victim, 34-year-old handyman Ted Hockney, was discovered just hours after the horribly mutilated body of Sheriff Walt Gaines... washed up on the shore of Bass Lake. Officials are unsure of the whereabouts... of Nora Cornell and her son Travis... Come on. Come on. Who, according to neighbors, were in the house... Hurry up. Let's go. Just moment before-- They're not through typin' the blood, but one sample is definitely canine. The dog's been injured. Yeah. We might have a chance at findin' them before the creature does. Whatever. Got some bruises, but he took the fall very well. That's a good boy. He's in good shape. He'll recover, won't you, boy? That's right. He's okay. He'll be fine. But I'd like to keep him here. No! No, you can't. We're just passing through. We weren't planning on staying. Yeah, we're from out of town. I'm going to get some antibiotic cream. I'll be right back. Mom, wait here. Is this the American Cancer Institute? Uh, I've got that dog you're looking for. Ma, that guy just called someone. I think he knows. I'm at the Upper Valley Animal Hospital-- up on Howard. No. Yes, ma'am, but there's a-- Yes. 33 Howard. Damn. Well, I should have at least given him some money. - Now we're really criminals. - Mom. We have to find some place to rest. I'm sorry to wake you. Oh, that's all right, Miss. How-- C-Could I have a room? Oh, yes. That's my job. Oh, dear. Oh, my. - What's wrong? - You've got an animal. We don't allow pets. Oh. Please? All right. But please, don't let my missus find out, okay? Okay. Okay. Um, room number two. Thank you. Shh. Look, the vet's here, right? Mm. And if they keep headin' north-- Did we blanket the area? Uh-huh. We got it covered. Ow. Mom, where are we gonna go? I don't know-- as far away as we can... until they catch this thing. Don't you think if they could've caught him that they would have already? I don't know. - All right. What about Tracey? - I don't know. - Suppose they never catch this thing. - I don't know, Travis! I just don't know, okay? Hey, we'll figure it out in the morning. Get some sleep. Good night, boy. Good night. You see, sir, no animals in this place. Ne-ver. Number one rule. But this stupido gotta-- What's a-matter with you? I'm sorry. You no hear radio? That bugger? They seemed like nice people. Hey! You, you, you! Yeah, you. You clean up those cancer germs, eh? We'll take care of it. Good. Shut up. They were such nice peop-- Hey, Furface. What is it? Mom, get up. Those N.S.O. guys. They found us. What? What? Get dressed. We can sneak out the bathroom window. Take the truck. Go to the cabin. No. Ma-- Just don't start the engine. They'll hear it. Let it roll to the road. Yeah, I know. I've been sneakin' out of the house for months, Ma. Remind me to spank you. Furface! Mrs. Cornell? Travis? Who is it? Lem Johnson, the N.S.O. At the hospital, right? Right. I-Is there something wrong? Could you open the door? I'd like to talk to you. It's a silly game you're playing, Mrs. Cornell. Beg your pardon? Where's your son and the dog? I don't know what you're talking about. If you'd been a criminal, Mrs. Cornell, you would have been locked up a long time ago. You blush when you lie. I really have no interest in speaking with you people. Now, if you'd please-- Why don't we... sit down... and be straight with each other? Mm? Now, I know it's fashionable... to think that Washington is full of secret, evil organizations, but stop and think for a moment. We're your government. We're the good guys. And we're in this together. I don't know who you are, but we are definitely not in this together. We know you've grown attached to the dog. - Is that attachment worth your son's life? - Are you threatening my son? No. As long as he's with the dog, his life is in danger. What have you done with his girlfriend, Tracey? We're protecting her. What did you think? That creature will kill anybody that's been near the dog. Why? Would you believe us if we took you to see Tracey? Okay. I take it back, Mrs. Cornell. You'd make a wonderful criminal. Goddamn dog. Look. Look, look, look. Dog hair everywhere. Stinking whole place-- Now I going stinking like a dog for a week. Ech. We're home. You know, my dad used to take me here all the time. I-I never killed anything. You know, I used to think that's why my dad divorced my mom-- 'cause I was a lousy hunter. I guess kids think pretty dumb things, huh? She really was quite banged up. We had to sedate her. Are you qualified to care for her? You're telling me this place is safer than a hospital? Tempered steel on the windows, and we're around. Nobody's gettin' in or out of this place. Tracey? Honey, are you okay? It's good you're here. You can look after her. I remember this. Level with me. We can't ever escape this guy, can we? Okay. So then I say, we make a stand, right here, right now. Why not? We got nothin' to lose. All right. I'm gonna go get some stuff. You stay here. Now, tell us where your son took the dog. We'll go get them and we'll bring them back here. She isn't hurt. There's nothing wrong with this girl. You've just kept her drugged. - She was quite hysterical when we brought her here. - You're crazy. Look, why don't you just tell us where the dog and your son are? Please. Eventually, we're gonna find him... or the creature will. Is that what you want? Hmm? Well, we'll do it your way. That it? Uh, no. No, I need, uh-- I need some shells. 30-30. How old are you, son? Let me tell you, sir. I'm old enough to know these woods like the back of my hand. Me and my dad-- we're staying up at Totem Creek. He told me that this week, my 16th birthday, was my day. The day. Yeah, but 30-30-- what are you bringin' down? - A grizzly. - Grizzlies is protected. I know that. Furface, I'm home. I got you some dinner. You feelin' better? Huh? What'd you do here? "I go. I danger 'U'"? "I stay, 'U' die"? Furface, we're in this together. You're-- You're not going anywhere. Where's Travis? He's okay. Come on. Trust me. No, no, no. He got him too. Where is he? He's safe. He's okay. - You saw him? - Mm-hmm. He's up at Totem Creek. No one's gonna get him. They won't let me go. Who? They keep injecting me. I feel funny. Come on, ladies. We're going. Where? Totem Creek. There's about two pounds of scrap metal in there, Furface. Think that'll stop 'im? It's somethin' my dad showed me. What's taking you so long, anyway? I beat you, didn't I? Let's see. What, "D-Z"? That's not a word. It is not. Oh, what, you looked it up? Okay. All right, mister. Okay. "D-Z." "Dozens." Oh, no. No. You cannot use abbreviations. Come on. You read the rules. You are such a cheat. It's those damn N.S.O. guys. And I got a surprise for them. Come on. Yes. You bastards. Come on. - Shit! Mom, Tracey, get down! Get in the cabin! Go, go, go! Get in! - What? - What the hell are you doin'? You're gonna kill somebody. Understand this, Cliff: none of these people can ever leave this place. But it's a woman and a couple of kids. Why? Because that's the way it's gotta be. I can't... and I won't do it. Okay. I'll do it myself. You're a cold son of a bitch. That's right. I am. Remember I told you there were three biological experiments the Oxcom, the dog and their best animal. It's me, Cliff. I'm the third experiment. What makes you so fuckin' special? I'm the perfect killing machine. I've got no conscience. Okay, I'm goin'. Furface, you watch them. Hi, there. Now, son, there are two types of animals on this planet. There are those that kill, and those that get killed. What kinda animal are you, son? Huh? Watch. You can't win... because Multitude's coming. Tracey, I'm fine. Ow! It's here. Ma, Ma, get the door. Tracey, get the shutters. Go! Go, go, go! Get into the bedroom. Hurry! Oh, my god! Ma, Ma, he's goin' around the house. Light this thing. Quick. Tracey, go! Get out of the window, quick! All right, Mom. Get out to the truck. Go! Be careful, honey. No! - Shoot! - I can't. I'll hit Furface. Shoot! Travis, no! Oh, Travis. Oh, Travis, you're okay. We gotta get to a vet. He's alive? Yeah. Here. We gotta hurry. Come on.
