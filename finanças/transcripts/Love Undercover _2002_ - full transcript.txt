Check. You! Get your eyes checked! Sir, give me another chance! Yes, sir! No, sir! Yes, sir! No, sir! Yes, sir! Left, left, left, right, left. Left, left, left, right, left. Left, stop. Halt! Yes, sir! So sorry, sir! Sir, are you all right? Sir, are you all right? - Sir. - L.K. Fong, with regards to your performance, you receive an A for your zeal and proactiveness. As to physical ability, shooting, knowledge in police regulations, Chinese, Maths and English, you either got a D or an E. Thank you, sir! And sorry, sir! I'll try harder! Who should you thank for your graduation? My parents, the Police Department, and you, sir! You should thank yourself. The police force is short of manpower now, and you've chosen the right time to join us. Starting from today, your PC number is 11661. Yes, sir! You'll be assigned to the Tze Wan Shan Police Station... - Yes. - Serious Crime Bureau. Thank you, sir! I mean the LPD across from it. LPD? Lost Property Department. That means lost and found! Yes, sir. The Personnel Department is fine now. How about guys from the Traffic Department? Are you currently dating? No, Madam! Do you have any prospects for me? I wanted you to introduce one to me instead! The head of the Serious Crime Bureau is a nice guy. He is quite a looker. I've been watching him for quite some time. Okay, he's heading out now! Madam, what's the big case? They're just heading out for breakfast! Hey, hold on! - I forgot to bring my wallet. - I can lend you some change. Good! Let's go! - Hey, Hung! - Officer Chung! You caught another criminal. I was just lucky. After you're done with him, come join us for breakfast. Thank you, sir! Stop being lustful! Get back to work! Yes, Madam! Hey, let's play mahjong tomorrow. We'll also introduce a guy to you. He's over six feet tall. He's a lawyer and he drives BMW. The best thing is that he isn't in debt. Right now, I just care about my work. As for love, I'll leave it to fate. Forget about leaving it to fate! You don't have anything to do! You're working in lost and found! That's right! Do you want to be like us, your old classmates? We just walk around everyday to maintain order. It's amazing! It's the climax of my life! Something big has happened! Stop there! Old lady, don't cross the road! Dad, I'm fine. I can make it. You know I can. Brave Young Police Officer Dies in Rescue Attempt Madam, what happened? Something has happened, but I don't know what. This one looks okay. She's new and green. Let's give her a try. Mama-san, no, Madam! Would you ask your girl to go in? Be good. What? - PC 11661! - Yes, sir! We've read your file. You have a clean background. You are green. You don't have to support your family... and no one is supporting you. You have no brother or sister. You have no relatives... no friends, and you have never dated. You don't even have a dog. Losing you will not be a loss to Hong Kong. You look quite honest, but you're a tad stupid. Yet, you still give us a tender feeling and a sense of pity. We would like you to carry out a special duty. - Are you willing to do it? - Sir, may I know the working hours? Just one day. Sir, can I be off by nine tonight? I have an appointment with my friends to play mahjong. Hong Kong is in trouble! How can you care about playing mahjong? I was just asking... No problem. Our mission is to do one thing, but you don't have to know too much. It's very simple. You'll be disguised as a waitress. We'll eavesdrop on our target... about his dealings. You just have to place a bottle of ketchup on his table. Understand? Understand! - Get changed. - Got it! - Do it in the van! - Yes, sir! The bug is right here. Place the mic close to the target person. Understand? Do-Re-Mi! Mi-Re-Do! Okay! Kuen. Test the mic. Say something. - Testing! Testing! Do-Re-Mi... - Okay! - L.K. Fong, wear it. - Okay. Can you hear me? Sir, you're right in front of me, of course I can hear you! I didn't mean that! I mean this! - Can you hear me? - Yes, sir! When the target appears, I'll ask you to place the ketchup on his table. - May I know, where my gun is? - You won't be wearing one! No questions then. - L.K. Fong! - Yes! From now on, you're a waitress! Any questions? Sir, how many diners will there be? Have you booked a table? - Do you smoke? - Good! Let's go! Kuen! Target has appeared. He's wearing a black leather jacket and red shirt. Target has appeared. He's wearing a black leather jacket and red shirt. How many people? - Two. - This way. I've brought the information. Please have a look. Let's bid at once! Push down the price to two cents, and lend him two hundred million. When they have no cash... Can I have the ketchup please? At that time, they have no... Kuen, get the ketchup back! All right, I'll leave now. - Bye! - Bye! Check, please! - Check? - Yes. All right! My dear colleagues, good news. Let's call it a day! Dismissed! Chuen... Why didn't you call me? We've broken up. Why should I call you? I didn't agree to break up with you. I said we've broken up, so we're done. It doesn't matter if you agree or not. Understand? Thank you! I'll give you one more chance. Let me go, okay? Do you believe I would hit you with this bottle? Miss, calm down! We can talk things through! Don't be rash. Let go! Of course I believe you would hit me with the bottle. This wouldn't be the first time anyway. This is why I wanted to break up with you. Drop the ketchup... Freeze! You're not required to say anything! How about I'll trade you a bottle of brown sauce for the ketchup? Move aside! This has nothing to do with you! I don't want to see you again! Of course, this is my business! She is messing up my turf! Hand over the ketchup now! You're a pain in the butt! You're wasting my time! Let's check on her! Hey... What are you doing? How dare you assault me! Do you know you'll go to jail? - Let's go! - Hands off! - Let's go! - Hands off! Let me go... How dare you hit me! Let's take it outside! Let me go... Oh no! Will there be scars? Everything's fine. You're the prettiest. Really? I'm sorry about this. What's your name? L.K. Fong, sir! What is this? - What? What did you say? - What is this? This is my hearing aid. I'm deaf. When I was small my grandmother slapped me... then I became deaf. I'm very very sorry! Don't be. Just treat me like an ordinary person. Take this to pay for a brain scan. I don't want your filthy money! What? Okay, I'm sorry. Bye! - Master, let's go! - Okay. I'll visit you tomorrow. Are you kidding? - Chuen. - Yes? Lately, why do you always place your hand on... your chest and look around? My nipple was bitten by a mosquito. I wanted to scratch it, but I was afraid my friends might see me. It's embarrassing. So put some ointment on. You look awful. Okay. Master Man, Mr Yau is here. - Mickey! - Hello, Man! What's up? Long time no see! You look great! You look good too! - Come on, have a seat! - Thank you! What brings you here? You've been so busy, you haven't had time for a chat. I had no choice, but to come here. What do you have in mind? You've only been back from college for three years, yet you've done a great job in the financial market. You're an expert in making money. You've made a fortune, haven't you? Money is not important. Sophistication is what counts. Just like you, Mickey. You're so popular with the girls! You can have first dip with the girls. As for making money, let's make a fortune together. I've decided to merge my company with yours to go public. This is a great idea and I'm doing you a favour. Taking your company public? That's a fresh idea! You know me. I always follow the trend. Anyway, we'll make money together! I don't want your filthy money! Hey, you think I'm funny? No, I was just thinking of something stupid. Sorry... You think I'm stupid! No, I didn't mean that! I'm sorry, Mickey. Sorry, okay? Boss, it's time to attend the ball. The heck with it! You're in my way! Boy, you're high society. You're delicate. Watch your step! Bye! Should we do something? Do what? Well, if not, then take a bath and have a good rest. We don't know how dangerous this mission will be. We hope you'll be willing to further engage the target. Serving the public is my desire, sir! - Good! - I request that you give me... a Medal of Valour, sir! - No problem! - I want a 4000 square feet apartment... on the Peak, sir! - But... - Waive my taxes for life... and I want the force to publish my autobiography to inspire the young, sir! Do you want to take over my post too? No, sir, because I'll do things step by step! For this case, you don't have to volunteer. This is an order! Yes, sir! About my requests... Dismissed! Kuen, can you hear me? Sure! I'm not talking to the wind! Kuen, you can do it. It's all right. Hey, can you tell me a joke? Why should I tell you a joke? Just to relax! No, I don't know any jokes. Just concentrate. Okay. Hey, open the door! I'm off! Give me a ride, okay? What's the matter? I'm off! Take me home, okay? The target hasn't shown up yet! It's late already! How can you believe what bad guys say? You can take a bus home! Open the door... Kuen, what are you doing? Helping out. All right! Done! Why are you here? I'd like to treat you to dinner... to thank you for what happened yesterday. It's okay, I don't want to eat. Kuen, you must go! What's for dinner? Let's go. What would you like? Noodles with fish balls. We serve Italian dishes here. So, make it Italian noodles with fish balls then. Please help me out here. Thank you, Mr Au! Well Mr Au, anything else you would like to order? Oyster sauce on vegetables with extra steak sauce. And iced milk tea with a quarter coffee! All right. Thank you, Mr Au. You're well-respected here. No, I have some shares in this restaurant. This is for you. The latest hearing aid. If there is any problem, here's the receipt. This is good for life. Kuen, how much is it? It's over 28,000 dollars! How long have you been a waitress? Two days. I mean in that restaurant. I worked in other places before. Kuen, I think he wants to woo you. Let him. Flirt with him. Flatter him. Seduce him! Why do you want to know so much about me? I'm telling you, I already have a boyfriend. So don't try to hit on me! - Boyfriend? - Boyfriend? My boyfriend loves me very much. So I'm loyal to him. We're just having dinner. After this, we'll go our own separate ways. If we bump into each other again, just ignore me! I think you've misunderstood me. I just consider you a friend. That's great then! Let's eat! How did you meet your boyfriend? You were high school classmates. You're no longer together. Kuen, show interest in him. Flirt with him! Flatter him! Seduce him! Instead of talking about him, why not ask him to dine with us? Okay. - Hi, Hung! - Speaking. Yes, guess where I am having dinner now? That's why I love you. You got it right. Come to join me now. Bye! I hope your boyfriend won't misunderstand me. Before he arrives, I won't answer any of your questions. All right. Kuen... Hung, let me introduce you to... Au Hoi Man. - Kuen, darling. - What? Have you decided yet? Decided what? You know, to be a hooker? To be a hooker! I've told you many times. If you won't do it, how could I pay off the debt? Where would I get the money to gamble? Even if you're deaf, you could read my lips! Hung, what's your line of work? I used to be a gigolo. You know, eventually you get to hate your job. I want to retire and travel around the world. Now I'm living off women. I've used up all her savings. So I want her to be a hooker! She's helping me to pay off my debt. She works as a waitress in the morning. She's a delivery girl at night. She gets up at four in the morning to deliver newspapers. That leaves her three hours for sleep. So why not lie down and make some money? - Kuen is my friend. - So what? I won't let my friend be a hooker. I'll lend you money to pay off your debt. Great! And you can run a small business too. How much do you want? Two million! That's quite a lot of money. I know she isn't worth this much. Don't, he'll catch a cold... Two million, right? Yes. Once you have my money, treat Kuen better. I know what to do. You're his now. Forget about me. I'll go get myself some hookers! I think you should be more careful at making friends. Are you insane? You gave him two million bucks for hookers. Kid, you're living off women, right? Come with me! Let's have a chat! Go in there! Hey, don't hit my face! Don't! No... - Where do you live? - Tze Wan Shan Police hostel. I mean the building across from it. - I'll send you home. - Okay. Bye! Come to me if you need help. Okay. Bye! On which floor do you live? - It's none of your business! - The code is 1234! - Bye! - Bye! Thanks a lot! - You live in flat 3B, right? - That's right... - You're so late. - Yes... Let's go! Calling HQ, we have a problem! It's 3B! Sir, what's the matter? Sir, what's the problem? You can enter now. We are now commandeering your flat! You can't earn all the money in the world. It's important that we spend more time together as a family. I know, Daddy. So, have you met a nice girl that you want to start a family with? Nice girl? I always feel that all the girls I meet... have ulterior motives to be with me. They don't really like me. But I met a girl lately. She's quite interesting. Is she pretty? She's really kind. What does she do? She is a waitress. So do you want to start something with her? No, I just think she is cute. Au Hoi Man has earned a lot of money from legitimate... business for his family. It's rumoured that... Mickey Yau of Tung Tung Hall is mingling with him. They are planning a merger... to run both legitimate and illegitimate business. Lolita, Au Hoi Man's ex-girlfriend. She is also Mickey Yau's cousin. We suspect that they faked their break up to mislead us. This is Mickey Yau. He started out working in a garage. The bottom line is that he is a bad guy. - L.K. Fong. - Yes, sir! - Someone is here to see you. - Who is it? Madam Cha, the Deputy Commander. Attention! Officer Fong, I appreciate your performance. Keep it up! Yes, Madam! A hero's biggest foe is a charming woman. Whether you're a beauty or not is in the eye of the beholder. But women may sometimes... achieve better than men, just like you. Madam, you're great! Thank you! The police force needs you, and you need the force. Yes, Madam! The mission has been upgraded. You'll have our full support. The code name of the mission is... Eagle Hunting! Well, is it a tad too common? Just a little, Madam. So, let's call it... Spanner! Okay, we'll call it Spanner then! Attention! - It's here! - Hey, this is weird. Why has your aunt moved to your house suddenly? Don't ask. Let's move it. - Hi! - Hi! It's pretty. It's confidential. L.K. Fong is just a waitress. Why is her flat so pretty? Sir, this was ordered by L.K. Fong. Hung, thank you! The house is now equipped with what we need. There are twenty-six cameras installed. Except the toilet... the flat is now covered from different angles. The smallest camera is as small as a needle. How about the biggest one? It's just like a video camera. Wow, that's so advanced! Not really. The most advanced product is this one! This is a portable wireless video camera! You can hold this pot and get close to the target... so we can get his close-up easily. Actually, the most wonderful thing is this massage chair. There's probably more than meets the eye! That's right. Actually, this is a lie detector. - Hung! - Yes, sir! When the target is hooked up to the chair, we can determine whether he is lying or not. Let's go over there and have a look. The maid's room is converted into a control room. Come and sit down. Let's give it a try. Hung! Yes, sir! - Are you gay? - No. If the light is red, he is telling the truth. If the light is green, he is telling lies. Hung, say, "You're not a man." You're not a man. He lied. It's so amazing. Let me try! Hung, do you have a girlfriend? We've just broken up. When did you have your first love? Twenty-six. How many women have you had sex with? I'll ask another question. What colour do you like? Yellow. Are you from a single-parent family? Enough... we don't want to know about our colleagues' secrets. Kuen, come here! - We're leaving now. - Okay. Who are you? Your honey? Officer Chung of the Serious Crime Bureau! Attention! - PC 2046, sir! - PC 75354, sir! Tell me why they are here! Sir, they're my friends and they're helping me to move in. - Do they know about the mission? - Not at all, sir! What are you holding in your hand? It's the confidential file of this case. We've just read it. It's detailed, especially about the introduction of the target... Stop bothering me! It's amazing. But the budget is a bit tight. Sir, I'm a bit worried for you. You're an undercover agent! You're really great! That's right! Who allowed you to read the file? It was on the desk, so we read it. You two will be transferred to guard the reservoir! - Really? - That's right! That's good. We don't have to patrol anymore! We can even go swimming and fishing! Hey, why don't you thank Officer Chung? Thank you, sir! Attention! Pack up and leave in five minutes! Yes, sir! Call Au Hoi Man and find an excuse for him to come here. Our budget is too tight, and it's almost finished. Got it. I ordered some food. Who are you looking for? I'm here to visit L.K. Fong. Daughter, someone's looking for you. Dad, this is Mr Au Hoi Man. Come in! My family is here to help me clean up. That's right. Mr Au, please come in. Lone! Ming! Come here! My two little brothers, Lone and Ming. - Nice to meet you! - Uncle! - Daddy! - Good kids... And they are... I am... Charlene! I'm Gillian! We are her brothers. We're born at the same time. We're... twins! - Brother... - My sons! - My daughter! - My friends! - My assistant. - My boss. What about that pretty girl? I am... - My girlfriend! - My sister! Actually, my brother treats my girlfriend like his sister! I love taking care of little girls! Yes, we all love taking care of girls! Why are you here? I...came here to use the toilet. That's it? He wanted to borrow money too. I have no money for you, and I won't be a hooker for you either. Just leave! - Go! - That's right! - Go! - All right, I'm leaving now! - Hurry up! - Bye... What a shame! Let me show you to the door! It's not really necessary, right? Sure I have to! Come on! Hey! Don't hit me! Stop it! Not below the belt! - Please... - What... - Sponge off woman? - Help... I could really die! Why are you suddenly so sad? It's because we are hungry. Daddy, we need to have hot pot with this little sister. - That's right. - Yes. Dear relatives, it's time to leave. Kuen, stay with your friend. Remember to wear your hearing aid. Yes, Daddy! - Do you earn a lot of tips? - What? How can a waitress afford such a big flat? May I take your order, Mr Au? You don't have to be so defensive. I'm not a bad guy. It's hard to tell. The first time I met you, you had a bodyguard... and your girl wanted to hit you with a bottle. It's because I had a little problem at home... and that girl was a bit hot-tempered. What trouble do you have at home? My dad was a triad leader. Wow, that's scary. Don't panic, he's retired. A retired kingpin! My dad spent ten years to support my study in finance and management. That's bad! You're so smart. I foresee turmoil in the triads soon. The bottom line is that I'm an honest businessman. So do you want a massage? - A massage? - Yes. - Let me ask you... - Don't be that straight forward. What is one plus one? - What? - Answer me! - Two! - It's the truth. A question about music. Who wrote the song "Children's Corner"? I don't know. It's Debussy! - Do you want to woo me? - No. - It's a lie! - You're lying! I do like you. I want to be your friend first... - And get to know you more. - It's the truth. Your curiosity is satisfied. You had your fun. Now leave! No! I'm really serious about looking for a better half. Really? You don't have to ask him questions about love. Yes, it's true... He really wants to marry you! Are you all right? What do you like about me? - You are a good person. - How do you know? Kuen, we're almost done. Ask him whether he is a triad member or not. So are you a triad member? I'll answer this for the last time. Never ask me again, okay? Don't circle around the question. Yes or no? Just tell me! I'm not a triad member. Not good. We've met a great liar. Actually, it's natural for a woman to get married. If he really proposes to you... then think about your psychological situation and plan. Then decide if you want to marry him or not. I'm worried that I may want to marry him. That's not a problem. I'm now investigating him. If he turns out to be a bad guy... and he is put behind bars, what should I do? There is no conflict here. In America, there was a female FBI agent... who married a mobster. They had kids together. Thirty years later, she got the evidence against him. She arrested him then. It's not a problem. What happened next? The agent took all his properties and money. Later she had schizophrenia and... she was committed to a mental hospital. Tried to kill herself... but she didn't die, and became a vegetable. What should I do then? L.K. Fong is now experiencing... a struggle that all undercover agents must face. Her rationality, emotions, wisdom and sexual needs are all messed up. If she is willing to admit to it when the struggle surfaces... then this is a normal reaction. Thank you. Take a seat. The heck with sitting! Do you have anything intimate to share with me? - No. - But you were beaten. It's nothing. It's part of the job. Darn you! In contrast, this officer doesn't... want to reveal his true feelings. I'm worried about him. The Spanner Mission will be prolonged by a month. Transfer Hung Chow to a desk job. Yes, Madam! It's serious! You need an operation! Are you kidding me? An operation? How much is it? Don't worry. Mr Au is a reputable man. We will charge less. What does it have to do with that? Are you going to cheat me? Kuen! There is a medicine for your ear. It may help you. Kuen, where do you want to go? They seem to be in love. No question about it. They are in love! Put down your case first. The fish here will not grab your stuff. - Mr Au has a deal today. - Chuen! I'm sorry, I'll be right back. Kuen, get ready to make the arrest! Do you want an inspection? Yes, thanks! Where is Kuen? Kuen! Kuen, come here! You told me that your rice cooker was out of order. That model is no longer available in Hong Kong. Master had a factory in Thailand custom-make it for you. He really treats you well. Hey, where is your hearing aid? Well, I'm trying not to get overly dependent on it. The doctor you introduced to me is really great. After a few drops of medicine... I could hear again. What's more... I could even hear the old lady next door chatting late at night. Then let's celebrate. Someone is watching us! Someone is watching us here? Yes. Why don't you make me a cup of coffee? Over there. - Go... - Okay. What is she up to? There we go! What's going on? Let me tell you a secret. What is it? - Don't tell anyone. - What is it? I've got a tattoo. A tattoo? What kind of tattoo? - Do you want to have a look? - Sure do! Let's go! It's pretty! Is it cool? It's cool! When did you have it done? When I was studying in the States. - May I touch it? - Go ahead Hey, it's real! Kuen, you're really great! I'll be free tomorrow. Why don't I take you out? - Bye! - Bye! You look pretty tonight. This cost me a month's salary. Don't you feel honoured? My dad will be very happy to see you. - Your father? - Yes. My dad. So, he's the Godfather? Don't be intimidated by him. He's a nice man. Ms Fong. - Thank you. - Come on. Daddy. L.K. Fong. Godfather, nice to meet you! May I dance with you? Music! - I'm sorry. - Never mind. I'm sorry, Godfather! - Just call me Uncle. - Okay. - I'm sorry, God Uncle! - It's okay... I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Sir, do you still feel itchy? I told you, I don't feel itchy! - Officer Chung speaking! - Daddy! Kuen! Mr Fong, I've got your daughter here. Who are you? This is Au Yiu-san! Au Yiu-san? The triad kingpin? Today is a family day. Come join us at the China Club. I have something to discuss with you. I'm telling you, if you hurt Kuen, I'll kill you! If you don't show up, I'll never let her go. Hello... Sir, do you still feel itchy? I said no! Thank you. This is my cousin. Hi! What? Kuen is in danger? - I'll be right there! - Is Kuen all right? Big trouble! Driver, stop ahead! - It's a restricted area! - Your mom's restricted! We're the police! Generation gap cops! We have to commandeer your minibus! Get off! Tracy! Lone! Stay to my left and right! You take a shield and cover my back. - Don't fire without my order! - Sir, what about me? - You can wait in the van. - Yes! Go... Go... Hey, which channel is it? Does your father know where to go? Why hasn't he arrived yet? Where is he going? He's coming to see me. I have to go to the toilet! Go... Go... - Officer Chung speaking! - Officer Chung, where are you? I'm on the way to save you! Kuen, what's your twenty? Third floor, ladies toilet, sir! And you? I'm at your door! I see! I was scared to death! Sorry, sir! Unload all arms and equipment, and retreat silently! Yes, sir! - Uncle, why are you here? - He lost his way. I've told you many times, no meeting on Sunday! Sorry! I'm scared of the dark. He's here to keep me company. - Coincidentally, I met Kuen! - Coincidentally, I met Kuen! And what is this? A souvenir! - He bought it in the Philippines. - It's a fruit basket! - You're so nice. - We're family, right? That's right... He must be my in-law! In-law... In-law... Oh no! Let me introduce you to them. - He is the head of the Pakpo Hall. - Nice to meet you! Nice to meet you! This is Mr Tang, a justice of the peace in the New Territories. This one here is from the IT City. Freeze! Boyfriend, have you finished the war game? Put your toy gun away first! I'll introduce Mr Au to you! This is Mr Au! Mr Au... Good, you're a smart kid... Cheers! "Police"? A cop? You're a police officer? My son is a police officer. Are the police not welcome here? Not at all! Everyone is welcome here! Let's dance... We don't dance! How about singing? - Are you okay with singing? - All right... Let's go and sing! Nezha fears not the Dragon King. A lion cub fears not, fierce tigers and prowling wolves. No matter what lies ahead... I will set forth bravely, with determination and faith. All might seem calm on the surface. But evil breeds in dark corners. How does one keep his goodness untainted? Your father loves you so much. Yes, he is my idol. If he asked me to kill, I would do it for him. What if he wanted you to kill me? You're crazy! If we were both drowning, who would you save first? What do you think? Today is Master Man's birthday. I'm dedicating this song to Master Man... and his girlfriend. Bravo! Clouds overhead the towering Paoma Mountain... casting its shadow on Kangding town. The crescent moon hangs, high in the skies of Kangding. Is today your birthday? Why didn't you tell me earlier? What are you doing? I'll tell you later. You know how to do woodwork? Is it fun to just hammer away? It's not just about hammering. It's about starting from scratch... to create something. There's a great sense of accomplishment. But you already have a big company. I make money from buying and selling other companies. It's different. Mr Au, will you be free on Friday? I won't be free on Friday. Nothing. I'm just sending my regards to your father. Bye. What will you be doing on Friday? Celebrating a birthday. It's your birthday again? It's your birthday! Have you forgotten I've seen your I.D. card? That's right! Where will you be taking me? Europe. Europe? How long will we be staying there? Three months. It's cold there! So wear a scarf. What are you doing? Nothing. Man has a meeting today. I'm free, so I came back for a chat. What's wrong with you? For whom are you knitting this? He'll be taking me to Europe, so I have to act my part. As his girlfriend, I have to contribute something. The wool is quite cheap! - Have you fallen for Au Hoi Man? - You're crazy! You're lying! Be a little more open-minded! I'm just doing my job. Silly man! - Kuen, do you love me? - I do! The machine is working. We can go on. Are you in love with Au Hoi Man? I don't love him... - Repeat after me. - All right. - I, L.K. Fong... - I, L.K. Fong... - love Au Hoi Man. - love Au Hoi Man. Kuen, we've assigned another policewoman to take your place. From now on, she'll take over your job. Why? The higher-ups have made a careful study. They think that you're getting too emotionally involved in this case. It'll affect the investigation. You have to break up with the target. Break up with him? So, what about me? You can't just think about your love life. You have to consider the safety of Hong Kong! If I can't even take care of my love life, how can I safeguard the peace of Hong Kong? Officer Fong, do you still remember... the oath that you took at your graduation? I declare that I will uphold and maintain the law honestly... faithfully and diligently without fear of or favour to anyone. There seems to be something wrong with you. It's going too fast. Chuen, slow down please! This is a highway. How can we slow down in a highway? I was referring to our relationship. You're right. I didn't expect it would develop so quickly. I'm not going. Kuen, what are you doing? What's the matter? Don't ask. Kuen, did I do something wrong? I don't like old castles. I'm afraid of ghosts. Let's not live in a castle then. Let's stay in a hotel instead. I don't want to fly. I'm scared of terrorists. If so, then let's go by ship. We don't have to go to Europe. We can go to Cheung Chau instead. Smile for me, okay? I don't love you. I want to break up with you. I want to break up with you. Hey, what you are doing is toying with his feelings! Kuen, did someone force you to do this? Are you seeing your ex-boyfriend again? There is a big gap between us. Just take it as a dream. Is there anything wrong about me? Of course there is! All of a sudden, you want to have breakfast in a castle. It's pretentious! It's showy! You actually look down on lower class people like me! I'm telling you, I feel miserable being with you. I'm tired of this. If you want me to be a lady of the upper class, then I would rather be a hooker. No one will use you as a hooker! That's none of your business! Chuen. Kuen, what is going on? I hate people speaking to me in English! You know English, French and German, but you can't speak Cantonese well. Do you like Hong Kong? Do you have a sense of belonging? I promise, I'll try hard. I told you to practise Cantonese with a cork in your mouth, did you ever try? Did you care about what I said? I want to learn Cantonese from you... during our vacation in Europe. Kuen, Plan B, ready! A present for breaking up. Kuen! Do you still want to go to Europe? Just forget about her! I'll find a supermodel for you to spend a lusty vacation. Leave her alone! - Hello, phone number enquiry? - Yes or no? No. Kuen! Stop calling my name, or I'll hit you with a bottle! Lady, we can talk things through! I'm telling you, if you see me again, walk the other way! I don't want the number of a model agency! Call an ambulance for me please! The number you want is 999. Kuen, just cry out loud. Sir, I'm fine! Police are also people. I understand how you feel. Kuen, your friends are here. Look. Kuen! It's a pity to lose a chance to go to Europe! Don't cry! If you cry, we'll cry too! Kuen, here is your Medal of Valour! Do you know any good men for me? - No. - Thank you. The SDU has accepted my application. Really? I'm waiting for their answer. I'm okay as long as I take my medication on time. Keep up the good work. The police force needs me! - The police force needs you! - You need me too! Come on! I've taken my medication. I feel much better now. There is a bug in the break up present. We're still monitoring Au Hoi Man. Help me type out the surveillance report. Collect the stuff from the reporting room. Yes, Madam! Wool hat. Diving goggles. Leather belt. Madam, I'm here to report a missing person. Show me your I.D. card. A bag of gold fish. Eight in total. - What's the nature of the report? - A friend of mine is missing. - What's the name? - L.K. Fong. How many days has she been missing? Thirteen days. I've brought her picture with me. Where was she seen the last time? At the car park under the Tin Kau Bridge. What was she wearing? A long white coat and black sports shoes. Stop right there! What are you in for? - A criminal escaped! - Stop! - Freeze! - Stop! Kuen! That's her! What crime did you commit? Hooking. - Uniform attraction! - So you're a hooker! Watch your mouth, otherwise I'll sue you for libel! What did you say? Do you know the law or not? It's not illegal to be a sex worker! - I want to post bail for her! - Just leave! Go! Officer, take me back to the vice department. I came out from there. Kuen, were you forced to do this by your ex-boyfriend? Come on! I was not forced! We've been together for years. He must have done something right. After I thought about it, I decided to help him just this once. Being a hooker is not a big deal! Loyalty counts, you know? Sir, let's go! Are you really willing to do this for him? You won't understand us poor people! Give way please. - Master! - Stop it! Freeze! Stop it! What's wrong with you? Luckily our mission is not compromised. The Spanner Mission has gone over budget. The investigation will be suspended indefinitely. Should we charge Au Hoi Man with assaulting a police officer? It's love that matters. Just go with your heart. The target is confused by love. He needs special attention. L.K. Fong, we have no right to interfere in your love life. But you can't disclose your real identity. How can I do it without exposing myself? Ask the psychiatrist to help you. Don't worry. The psychiatrist will teach you what to say. The target is psychologically unstable. He may go insane. You must follow the instructions. Yes, Madam! You cannot have any physical contact. You have ten minutes. Man, I had an unhappy childhood. Because I have low self-esteem, I decided to become a hooker. I wanted to punish myself. I'm sorry. Thank you for taking care of me. I appreciate what you did. I have nothing to say. But I have something to tell you. I had an unhappy childhood. My dad is my adopted father. Since I was a kid, I always felt lonely. So I've been very defensive. Gradually, I only cared about money and fame. I didn't know how to care for others. You took care of me. It's because I wanted to show you that I was different. I pitied you for your deafness. I felt sorry for you that you were forced into prostitution. I saw you as Cinderella. I wanted to transform you into a princess. A fairy tale. But you've changed me instead. I understand how much one is willing to sacrifice for the sake of love. Out of love, you could prostitute yourself for your boyfriend. I wish you a happy life together. He may be lying. Kuen, it's possible he doesn't love you anymore. I shouldn't interfere in your decision... as long as you're happy. Should you need help, I hope you will remember me. Kuen, he's totally disappointed in you. Don't drag this any further. Split up. Let's start all over again, okay? Let's get married. About your boyfriend, let me take care of it. We've found out that he is an illegal immigrant. Now we're deporting him back to Harbin. Anything else you want to say? Kuen, I'm sorry! I have to go now! See you. I want to be with her forever. I'll leave her to you then! I wish you good luck and happiness! - Move it! - Bye! Let's go! - Uncle! - Good girl. - Hello, Mr Fong! - Hello, In-law! We are all adults. Let's be straightforward with each other. All right. I'm sorry. Officer Chung speaking! I'm in a meeting now. - I'm sorry. - Your daughter's surname is Fong. Why do you call yourself Officer Chung? Well, Officer Chung is my name. Actually, my full name is Officer Chung Fong! Alex Fong Chung Sung is our relative! I didn't know that. May I know how to write the Chinese character for "Officer"? The character for "Officer"? Well, it's like this. I see! There is indeed a character for "Officer." - Yes! - That's right! There is a character for it! Where were we? - Straightforward! - Right, straightforward! One, two, three! It's so pretty! Do you like it? I would be happier if this were a motorbike! Do you have to be that honest? Can't you lie to me? But of all the girls I've met, you're the first one who didn't lie to me or cheat me. This is your character. It's really rare. About the dowry, it's just a formality. How about eight... Let's make it eight million! No way! We're marrying her off. We're not selling her. Eight thousand would do. Should a couple be honest with each other? What do you think? I have something to tell you. Go ahead. I have a special identity. In fact, I am... Protect Mr Au! Go... Go... Hello, phone number enquiry? Go... Go... Kuen! Watch out! I'll protect you! Go... What's the matter? Take care of the kids! This way! Hurry! Be careful! This way! Go... Go... Oh, poor thing! Go... Go... Go... - It's dangerous! - Is he okay? Go... Daddy! Is he all right? - Check whether he has been shot. - Okay. Sir, he's not shot! But his head is cracked. Three ribs are broken. His shoulder is dislocated. His kneecap is shattered and his leg just dangles uselessly. Don't worry. He's just suffering from osteoporosis! I'm sorry. Are you scared? Dad, I think we may have to postpone the wedding. That's right. We'll just print out another set of invitation cards. No way! If we do that, we're telling our enemies that we're weak. They would think we're nothing. The wedding will be held as scheduled! Chuen, you watched Man grow up. I'm counting on you to be the host of the wedding. Thank you, sir! I'm sorry to disturb you. Kuen, can you come out for a while? As instructed by our senior, this operation is reinstated. Excuse me, I have to leave now. Shouldn't we investigate first? Investigate? We don't have to investigate. It's Mickey Yau who spread the news! He couldn't wait to brag about taking out Au Yiu-san. If I'm right about him, I think he won't stop. I suggest we take the initiative before he makes his next move! Kid, your father has taken care of you for many years. We won't force anyone to do anything. You make your own decision. No need to think about it. Just kill him. All right, I'll go. Kuen, this is serious! - I know. - I'm glad that you do. Our satellite bug was out of order last night! You have to tell me what the Au family discussed last night. They mentioned that recently business is bad for taxi drivers. They also said that the price for vegetables is high. And the people in Hong Kong are spending their money in Shenzhen. That's it? Yes, they just talked about the news and about... people from Hong Kong living in Mainland China. Report back if you hear anything new. Of course... Hey Man, where are you now? Speak up! Roger, I have something important to ask you! Don't waste my airtime! What do you want? Tell me! How can you stop a man from leaving? Are you kidding me, Kuen? When have I been stopped by a woman? Have you ever experienced that? Kuen, right? As the old Chinese saying goes... a lustful woman meets a horny man. In a word, sex! Do you want to have some wine first? That's a good idea! I'll get it! Didn't you say you wanted to drink? Hey, drink up... Let's get drunk! Come on! - You're awake. - Where is Man? You don't need to know too much. In eight hours, you'll be in Taiwan. Who is going to Taiwan? Master Man has arranged everything. Go back to sleep. Find a place to drop me off up ahead. - Is Man going to kill Mickey Yau? - You also know about it? - When will he do it? - I don't know. - Where will he do it? - I'm sorry, I didn't ask. You're so ridiculous! You don't know anything! How can you be a bodyguard? For such a dangerous stunt, you should have fought for it! I tried, but I failed! If something goes wrong, what should we do? Master Man is smart and calm! Nothing will happen to him! It's illegal to kill! Don't mislead me! He's only going to kill a bad guy! Even if it's a crime, he would not be convicted! No matter what, it's wrong to kill! There is always a grey area between laws and social ethics! Let's talk about this later, okay? Do you know what a big scumbag is? Do you want to be one? - Get Man back to me now! - Yes, got it. Hey! You... Hello, Officer Chung, Man is missing! He is going to kill Mickey Yau! - When will he do it? - I don't know. - Where will he do it? - I didn't ask. You don't know anything! How can you be his girlfriend? Au Hoi Man is on his way to kill Mickey Yau. It will be a total mess. Lone, call 999 now. Ask the patrol officers to search... - For the target! - Yes, sir! Ming, contact the traffic department. Shut down land, sea and air! - We don't have such authority! - Why not? If not, then close one of the exits at the Tsim Sha Tsui MTR station! - Tracy! - Yes! Call for both ambulances and hearses! - Yes, sir! - Kuen, call the restaurant... to see whether the food is ready for delivery or not. Okay. Sir, we need a warrant to close the MTR exits. Warrant? Fine. Tracy, tell the inspector to come back immediately. Yes, sir! - Lone! - Yes, sir! - Tell the negotiator to stand by! - Yes, sir! Sir, Commander Cha is on line two! Hung, check if the food has been delivered or not! - Yes, sir! - Y. Chung speaking! We've got a problem here! We need your full support! We need high-tech support! Thank you, Madam! Sir, the dog is here! All right, back-up has arrived. Kuen, where is Man's stuff? Hung, take care of it. Yes, sir! Tracy, call the restaurant and add macaroni to the existing order! - Yes, sir! - It's almost dawn! Okay! We've got forty-six leads regarding Au Hoi Man's whereabouts. But we don't know which one is the real one. Ming, call the air force. Ask for a Black Eagle helicopter! Yes, sir! Tracy, check if the food is ready or not! Yes, sir! Call this number. Man wants to kill Mickey Yau. We have to locate Mickey Yau in order to find Man. Mr Yau? - Speaking? - May I know where are you now? King's Karaoke. - All right, thank you, bye! - Bye! Man is at King's Karaoke! Tracy, check the address! - Yes, sir! - Let's go! - Ming, get the car key! - Yes, sir! Go... - Mickey! - Hoi! I haven't seen you for days. I think you've lost weight. - Have a seat! - Thank you! I'd like to introduce you to my friends. Keith. Hung. He looks like a rotten egg, right? No, not at all! Hey, he's such a hypocrite! No, he's not. This is just a social skill. Man, let's have a drink! All right. About what happened to your dad, it's been rumoured that I did it. Man, do you think this is fair or not? As long as you're innocent, a rumour doesn't mean anything. You're so open-minded! Learn from him! Yes, Boss! Four cans of beer, please. - Welcome! - Where is Mickey? - Room 304. - Thank you! Hey, what's wrong? Who is singing my song? Kuen! Mickey, I want to send her home first. I want you to leave with me! - I have something to do here. - No! Don't you understand? I'm PC 11661, L.K. Fong. You're under arrest! You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say... can and will be used against you in a court of law. What happened? I'm an undercover agent with the Serious Crime Bureau. Do you understand? I'm a mole. What do you want from me? What do I want? If I were late, you would be charged with murder! Are all your family members undercover cops too? They are all police officers. - How about your boyfriend? - He is too. How about the hawker who sold fish balls in Mong Kok? He's a real hawker. How about the one who sold beef balls? He's an undercover agent. But the one who sold snacks next to him was a real hawker. How about the watchman in your building? He's a real watchman, but the flat isn't mine. That means I've been a fool for a long time, right? Not exactly. After all, I was working undercover. You weren't all that foolish. My son-in-law-to-be, where is my daughter? Stop pretending! No, I think of Kuen as my real daughter! Where is she now? - Go up! - Yes, sir! What's going on here? Maybe they are shooting a scandal documentary or something. - Master! - What are you doing? It's Chuen! - Have you found Kuen or not? - Master... This has nothing to do with him! I'm responsible for everything! I'm also the murderer! Officer Chung Fong? A police officer? Chuen, we've been fools for a long time. How long? Sir, we've found Kuen. She said she's fine. Fong's ex-boyfriend? He's a cop too? Yes, and so is Kuen. We'll go over the details after we get back to the station. Will he charge us with assaulting a police officer? - Sir, may we go now? - No. - Hung, where is Kuen? - She refused to come down. Kuen, answer me! Sir, has Man left yet? Not yet! Come down immediately! But it's embarrassing. This is an order! Kuen... There are many cops outside! Not sure what happened. Let's wait for a while before we leave. You're crazy! Why should we wait? Have you done something bad? That's right. Take it. - What is that? - Cocaine. - Cocaine? - Perfect! What's the matter? You can enter now. - What's the matter? - FBI! - Interpol? - It's FBI, stupid! Can you see it? Move it! We've been here for ages. We can finally go back to Washington! You are under arrest! You have the right to remain silent. Hi, Mary. You're sleeping? I'll come home soon. Yeah... Honey, okay, bye! - Let's go! - Move it! Kuen... - What are you doing? - We're working! FBI! Officer Chung, the FBI is working here. Did they get the consent from the Hong Kong government? - It's true! Sorry! - Sorry! Let's go! Man, I had nothing to do with what happened to your father. Keep quiet, please! Go! There's Kuen! Sir, we're heading back, right? You drove a police vehicle without permission and jumped a red light! I want an explanation! I was trying to prevent a crime from happening, sir! I'm very satisfied with that. Do you have anything to add? I'm not your subordinate. Save it! Hey, don't be so petty! Kuen, just say sorry! Right, it's my fault. I shouldn't use violence to solve my problems. But I really don't know you. Actually, you may not know me as well. - Play this for me! - Yes. Hey, it's Master love declaration! Come on! I deposited forty million dollars into your account. The stocks and title deeds have all been transferred under your name... and sent to your home. Kuen. I just want to say... I love you. What's wrong with you? You just gave me forty million. That means you have another girl, right? About the wedding, you can just forget it! No way! You want to dump me after you had your way with me! When did I have my way with you? Master! - What happened? - Kuen! - She's been shot! - Protect Kuen! Go... Go away! Call the ambulance! Hello, ambulance... Stop calling! I can't get through! I'm dead! Help me! I'm dying! Kuen! Madam! You're here! Someone's shot! Kuen, you're all right? I'm fine! I'm always lucky! It's great! She's fine! Give way! Attention! You've all had your fun. - Let's go find the shooter! - Yes, sir! Kuen! Darn it! Officer Chung! I... I'm shot! Protect Officer Chung! Go... Don't move! I'm innocent, please don't... Pull the trigger! Don't! Don't go! Lolita, violence won't solve anything. You can't escape. Don't move! You're under arrest! The target hasn't shown up yet, over. Miss, do you have a light? What light? I don't smoke! How about gas? I was just asking. Leave now or I'll hurt you! What's up with you? You're posing as gigolos? Be more professional! What should we do? Show me a gigolo pose! It's time to call it a day! Take it! - There's more! - I'll hold it for you! Hello! Go... go!
